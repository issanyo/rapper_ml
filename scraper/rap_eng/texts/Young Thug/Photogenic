[Intro]
808 Mafia
Thugger, ay, Thugger, ay
She so fine, and she photogenic

[Chorus]
He been did it but now I'm doing it
All these lil' bitches, they some allen ratchet
All of these fuck niggas some alley cats
You cakin' bitches, where they do that at
Call Eliantte, let's tour that
They gettin' money but I'm like who is that
I'm sellin' out and I turn up for the crowd
She turn it up, she turn it up for the crowd
I swear to God, she photogenic
I swear to God, she photogenic
My eyes on her, she photogenic
Treat her like a gym and perform gymnastics
Only gettin' bigger like I'm Fat Bastard
I'ma grind harder, climb up on that ladder
She wan' do it, I don't even gotta ask

[Verse 1]
C-O-D, cash on delivery
On that gangster shit, I can't tell, I keep it in the street
I was grindin', grindin', rappin'
I was trappin' my CD
First they just was laughin'
Now these niggas mad when they see me
Throw that money, out the top inside the T-top
Hunnid twenty, got my teeth white as a Reeboks
Three five of dank inside a Backwood like it's legal
I hit the club just to fuckin' see her cause she photogenic
You Goddamn right she photogenic
I know she know she photogenic

[Verse 2]
YSL on my styrofoam and in red
Yellow diamonds on my pinky, call 'em Lemonheads
They don't wanna tell they rather fuck and suck instead
I fought the baby 'til she lazy, can't get out the bed
Lotta spots like a motherfuckin' cheetah nigga
Tell you somethin' about that bitch you wanna leave with, nigga
I fucked, then passed her to my bro like a receiver
And that pussy wet like she a seagull nigga
Hermès, I got a Bel Ami by Hermès
I need some perkys, call my fuckin' med
She spilled the bean, why did she do that
My nigga told me, "Shoulda knew that"
She playing games, she make me nude
Fuck around and make me YouTube it

[Chorus]
He been did it but now I'm doing it
All these lil' bitches, they some allen ratchet
All of these fuck niggas some alley cats
You cakin' bitches, where they do that at
Call Eliantte, let's tour that
They gettin' money but I'm like who is that
I'm sellin' out and I turn up for the crowd
She turn it up, she turn it up for the crowd
I swear to God, she photogenic
I swear to God, she photogenic
My eyes on her, she photogenic
Treat her like a gym and perform gymnastics
I'm looking bigger like I'm Fat Bastard
I'ma grind harder, climb up on that ladder
She wan' do it, I don't even gotta ask
