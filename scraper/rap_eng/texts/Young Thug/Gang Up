[Intro: PnB Rock]
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I'm with the gang, gang, gang and we 'bout to go up
Switching lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up
You a lame, lame, lame and you so below us
Bet your hoe, she know us
'Cause you know we blowed up
We stay down
And came up, and came up
We stay down
We came up, the gang up

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz (Yeah)
I'm a villain that's winning
With precision, I'm killing
Represent the religion
Ended up independent
Took my car to the clinic
Let 'em check all the vitals
Middle finger to rivals
Michael Jackson, my idol
Still ducked in a pie hole
Talk to the plug, every day except Cinco de Mayo
I still got me a Carlo
Still got money, Carlo
Your car running so bad, it stink up the Apollo
Call my Rollie a Ralo
Call my AP a app
I ain't talking seat-belts when I say that I'm  strapped
I'm in love with my side hoe
I.. sneak her through the side door
I'ma show you what we ride for
I'ma show you what we die for

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I'm with the gang, gang, gang and we 'bout to go up
Switching lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up
You a lame, lame, lame and you so below us
Bet your hoe, she know us
'Cause you know we blowed up
We stay down
And came up, and came up
We stay down
We came up, the gang up

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'm in my same lane, lane that ain't gon' ever change up
I blow the brain out the range like a Taz Angel
Here's R.I.P. to Paul Walker homie got his stain up
We had your main on us, now we got stains on us
And all we gotta do is stay down and come up while they flexin' (What we gotta do?)
Yeah, I got her Indian and she Western
Yeah, I just had sex with one of your best friends
Then that fast and furious started nesting
Say I'm bout to go take off on you (Take off on you)
Is you staying, is you rolling like a scroller? yes you are
Your ready to take off like a 1980 Coke
He know that Instagram shit, are you gon' post that?

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I'm with the gang, gang, gang and we 'bout to go up
Switching lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up
You a lame, lame, lame and you so below us
Bet your hoe, she know us
'Cause you know we blowed up
We stay down
And came up, and came up
We stay down
We came up, the gang up

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, I'm always with my gang
We always ready to ride 'cause for the squad, we'll do anything
Stay down, we'll never change
We always gon' stay the same
Put you in check, when you outta place
I try to tell 'em not to mess with my gang, gang, gang
We do what we gotta do and don't complain-plain-plain
I'm on the road, I'm probably fresh up off the plane, plane, plane
Know you heard about me, I do my thang, thang, thang
I got the world on my back
I put your girl on her back
I did it all on my own
Now there ain't no turning back
And my whole squad got my back
And shawty so bad, I asked her if she repped the gang, she said "Facts"
Gang, gang, gang

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I'm with the gang, gang, gang and we 'bout to go up
Switching lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up
You a lame, lame, lame and you so below us
Bet your hoe, she know us
'Cause you know we blowed up
We stay down
And came up, and came up
We stay down
We came up, the gang up
