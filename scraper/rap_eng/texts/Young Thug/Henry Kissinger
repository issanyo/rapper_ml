[Intro]
This mother fucka brazy bro, Jeffery
I don't even wanna waste no time, let's get it
Hey!

[Hook]
Nigga wanna start a war? Nigga let's spar-spar
Shoot at the cop car, gon' and spark-spark
You want that spark-spark? Bentley sport-sport
I just got another grill, not no backyard
Smoking on koala leaves
Mix it with some collard greens
Drink clean, Aquafin', fingers on Lordan rings
Lil momma riding me, she pull up and wildly
I just want that fettuccine, I just speak that guapanese

[Verse 1]
Run up a check, run that shit up on your ass hoe
She got more water than Cancun
I put that dick in her asshole
[?] call it a bad hoe
Steven Seagal out the Rambo
I got that stick on my shoulders, 500 rounds, I got ammo
Run up a check, Pateky Philippe cost a check (slatt)
Run up a check, the top off the B cost a check (woo!)
Run up a check, get you some ice, that's a bet (ha)
Spend you a check, I [?] with a check
Check, run up a check, check, check, check (check, slatt)
Run up a check, nigga that's a bet (bet)
Slatt, run up a check, run up a check, check
Slatt, run up a check, run up a check, check! (slatt, slatt)
The top off the Rover, the top off the 'vette
Her panties, they soaking, they treating me hectic
I'm still acting reckless, I'm still acting trecherous
I'm still taking care of the fam, I'm still getting my blessings
Money tall, Charlie Sheen
Money tall, gang green
Money talk, the conversation
United Blood Nation

[Verse 2]
(Jeffery!)
Boy I got the top off
I said boy I got my top off
She gon' blow a nigga socks off
Yeah that jewelry boy a knock off
A lil nigga rocked the boat, my real name was stop and go
Pimp shit, cash flow, we coming for your ass for sure
If it's green, that's my grass for sure
If it's lean, that's my glass for sure
I'ma do it real rational, I'ma do it for the ratchet hoes
Do it for the ratchet hoes, we gon' do it for the classy hoes
We gon' do it for the fashion hoes
We gon' do it for the baddest hoes
We gon' do it for the trashy hoes
We gon' do it for the cabin hoes
We gon' do it for the college hoes
We gon' do it for the knowledge hoes
