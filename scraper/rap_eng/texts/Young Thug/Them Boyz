[Intro: Young Thug]
Ayy, God, I ain't scared of nothin' but them boys
King Slime
I ain't scared of nothin' but these boys
Turn it up, turn it up in my ear, uh

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm not scared of nothin' but them boys
I don't play with nothin' but them boys
I'm not scared of nothin' but them boys
I'm not scared of nothin' but them boys
I'm not gon' play nothin' with them boys
Have a shootout when we bored
I love this shit, I adore it
Call up my log man, come cut down a tree

[Verse 1 : Young Thug]
My bitch say I do the most
I drink 'til I overdose
I pour, pour, pour syrup up
Scream free the goat 'til you choke
I'ma treat her like I don't know her mama
Gon put some diamonds in their throat
I'ma speed off, fuck your old man
I'm livin' life like the pope
Shad da God got an AP and it's all flooded, black diamonds
Ayy, Blacc Chyna know
Behind her, know
Got behind her, know
Got it
I swear to God, Lil Thugga, somethin'
I swear to God she wanna fuck or somethin'
I swear to God she wanna

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm not scared of nothin' but them boys
I don't play with nothin' but them boys
I'm not scared of nothin' but them boys
I'm not scared of nothin' but them boys
I'm not gon' play nothin' with them boys
Have a shootout when we bored
I love this shit, I adore it
Call up my log man, come cut down a tree

[Verse 2: Shad da God]
God, fuck up the beat
Every time I ride, nigga, trey pound on the seat
Two times, these streets
Man I'm fuckin' with these hoes when I'm s'posed to be in the streets
Ten racks in the pockets of me
Three grams and a Backwood with me
I'm not scared of nothin' but them boys
We play with them bats like toys
Margiela my body, they not makin' noise
I [?] I'm paranoid
Flexin' 40 on a bitch, not a big bitch
That's new racks, bitch, I saw you with [?]
Had them racks, lil' bitch, I serve these niggas with a 30 stick
Alexander McQueen, I got this shit from Neiman's, bitch
God!

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm not scared of nothin' but them boys
I don't play with nothin' but them boys
I'm not scared of nothin' but them boys
I'm not scared of nothin' but them boys
I'm not gon' play nothin' with them boys
Have a shootout when we bored
I love this shit, I adore it
Call up my log man, come cut down a tree
