[Intro: Young Thug]
I just realized
This just a such a slimy world, namsayin'

[Chorus: SG Tip & Young Thug]
New Glock on Red Redemption (slatt)
This perc it got me itching (itching)
You said "Chanel what?" (what?)
Bitch, you must be tripping (haa)
I'm kinda slowed up (yaa)
This ack inside my kidneys (ack)
I tried to show love but you turned into a witness (bitch)
I'm ready to blow up so I can shit on feelings (woo!)
I got a bag, you got a bag but we both know the difference
I had her first, you had her last
She missed out on this dripping
This new draco it hold 33 so ain't no way I'm missing

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
This draco I got must be gay
It's fucking many women (damn)
This lil nigga reckless, this lil nigga reckless dawg (dawg)
Shoot your intestines, hunt ya down like a hog (woo)
ASAP Rocky braids, loyal Daniel Kane (damn)
Too many bitches stored in my phone, need data (need need data)
I watch these hoes, I don't need no cable
These bloods will eat you like you Bojangles
Wipe your nose later (slatt)
No games, no SEGA
If I hide your folks, you'll never find those
Back it in the truck, I got a wide load (back it up)
I'm 'bout to put my dick right in her wide nose (come here bitch)
Yea, your wife know (on god)
That's that line hoe

[Chorus: SG Tip & Young Thug]
New Glock on Red Redemption (slatt)
This perc it got me itching (itching)
You said "Chanel what?" (what?)
Bitch, you must be tripping (haa)
I'm kinda slowed up (yaa)
This ack inside my kidneys (ack)
I tried to show love but you turned into a witness (bitch)
I'm ready to blow up so I can shit on feelings (woo!)
I got a bag, you got a bag but we both know the difference
I had her first, you had her last
She missed out on this dripping
This new draco it hold 33 so ain't no way I'm missing

[Verse 2: SG Tip & Young Thug]
This snake is on my shirt (slatt), it might be python (python)
I'm from straight out them trenches (yea), I'm Atlanta born
I jumped straight in the streets, I was hands-on
We cool, he knew my face what but I put my mans on (god damn)
His trigger finger itching so you bet not move wrong
Thank god he beat the case, we ain't got to put no boots on
We gon make it out one day (on god)
Even if it's play by play
I stash my money up (why?) just for a rainy day (let's get it)
We getting them bags in (come on), I'm doing 10 a day
And if it's tough talk (what?), I know where your momma stay (let's get it)
I got a hard decision (why?)
Do I want to shoot or lay? (both!)
There ain't no way I'm missing, red dot to his face (blatt!)

[Chorus: SG Tip & Young Thug]
New Glock on Red Redemption (slatt)
This perc it got me itching (itching)
You said "Chanel what?" (what?)
