[Intro: Young Thug & Offset]
These are my choices
Fell in love with the money
These are my choices, yeah
Yeah yeah
Offset, Migos, Thugger

[Hook: Offset]
I fell in love with the money, I cut these bitches off and divorced them
Mason Margiela, I'm dabbin’ on bitches they eat it like porcelain
I put my heart and my soul on this bitch now we riding Rolls Royces
I got the streets in one hand, got the rap in the other
These were my choices
Those were my choices, on that lean I hear voices
I got fame and got fortune, those were my choices
Those were my choices, tell me what is your choice
Tell me what is your worth, I just [?] on the Earth

[Verse 1: Offset]
I just sit down and I think about all of the shit comin' with money, yeah
She want to fuck on me bounce on my dick like a motherfuckin bunny, yeah
Listen to me when I talk and I dont need a beat I go acapella
Diamonds dancing when the camera flashing you gon know when we up in here
I made the choice to go sell some dope, I got money that I never seen before
Let That bitch ride my dick on her tippy toes, I could never fall I won't lie under oath
Made the choice to get the money
Thankin god because the devil after me
Gotta show that they [?]
And Im ballin on niggas like after league
Back to the basics gotta get these faces
Took the shit they came with choices, embraced it
Thugga told me that these bitches be brazy
Put yo dick in her mouth and told her taste it
Came a long way, rappin’ in momma basement
We married the money, we skilled in engagement
Roll the backwood, and I sit down and face it
All my choices I sit down and face it

Imma fuck on them thots, take em all to the spot
Take em all to the spot, [?]
Diamonds bright like a star, cookin' fish scales with no tar
Diamonds fightin goin to war, roll that pussy like a car
Suck that doggy make it bark, put that [?] in a car
I dive in that pussy its deep

Baby what is your choice, you choose them or choose me?
You chose him cause he was a dork, you didn't care about hurting me
You dirty dirty, girl you dirty, I hope he leave you in the streets
