I got a tech, I got a Uzi
Guns on Obama, thats a Bazuka

[Verse:  Skippa Da Flippa]
Black Gucci shoes, Black Gucci shoes, (swear)
I was Gucci'd down when Gucci made the news
Spiked louboutins I bought some for my friends
Givenchy on my kin I can't wait to do it again
I'm movin' fast and forward I'm movin' fast and forward
And when I go and walk in, they so low they close the store
Pair of New Margielas, go in Neimans cop some more
I'm movin' fast and forward

[Verse: Young Thug]
Hoe wet in them [?] my swag everlastin', bitch I'm
Servin' my woes, cabbage
Skippa he started that dabbin'
Feel like a robber kidnappin' they're jackin'
Searchin' for the tools
Doin what I eat I'm clean
Watch
