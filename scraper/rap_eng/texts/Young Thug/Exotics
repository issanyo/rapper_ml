[Hook: Yung Mazi]
Exotic whips disrespect the speed limit
Hyrdraulic pumps, push bricks to the limit
I got a condo in they sky so that can't be the limit
I forgot to mention, you can't get it cause its limited edition
My bitch she limited edition, that coupe is limited edition
These shoes they limited edition
Choices, decisions, limited edition

[Verse 1: Yung Mazi]
Red bitch and some red bottoms, on red carpet
Red, ask her why, she ready
Red bandana, pouring up in a red Fanta
Bad like the devil, red cameras
Red candles, Pistol pete, red scandal
Stash spot, red ?
5 star towel
No BET, Red channels
Shooters red rum
Shoes look like I stepped in some red gum
I'm a red nigga, we red beams
Worst nightmare, red dreams
I pull red strings
Mix the purple with the red
I'm rocking with the red team

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I know you're gonna miss it, but my dick isn't unlimited
These bitches just wanna have my kiddie
These bitches just want up in my business
These bitches wonderin' how I'm livin'
These bitches wish they had my visions
All these bitches in competition
For Young Thug nigga, I forgot to mention
Thats the attitude, my momma tell my it stank
I guess you get a lil cocky when they know you in the bank
That fork sank into the pyrex pot, like tank
I'm on a gram of molly, I'm with Molly

[Verse 3: Yung Mazi]
Red Bugatti, red rari
Red Martins
Paint the city red
My duffle red, my hustle never red
Smokin' weed runnin' red lights
Bloody murder red
Flip my switch I turn red
Flip my bitch I get head
Flip a brick I get bread
Coca Cola red, baking soda
Fuck the feds, pull the trigger
That lens turn red
Red box, on the block
Pitchin Roger Clemons Red Sox
Mix the molly with the red ciroc
GTC drop that red top
Stop that red drippin' for your body drop
