[Chorus: Young Thug]
It's your birthday, you can cry if you want to
Get high if you want to, ride by if you want to, yeah
Your birthday, you can cry if you want to
Die if you want to, multiply if you want to girl, yeah (aye)
And I know you wanna have some fun, yeah
And I know you wanna have some fun, yeah

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Cause it ain’t no fun when I wrap it like a bun, (aye)
I pick your carats outta rabbit and then I put 'em in my charm, yeah
I put it right inside my arm, yeah
I put it right on top of her tongue, yeah
And she said it was so yummy, yeah
It was so yummy, I put it on my jammies till I started coming
Till she started cumming, then I started cumming inside of her tummy
She said that she's ready to become a mommy
You know one thing ’bout it, that motherfucker gon' have no book like a comic
You know one thing about it, when I'm on that Molly I fuck out your lungs

[Chorus: Young Thug]
It's your birthday, you can cry if you want to
Get high if you want to, ride by if you want to, yeah
Your birthday, you can cry if you want to
Die if you want to, multiply if you want to girl, yeah (aye)
And I know you wanna have some fun, yeah
And I know you wanna have some fun, yeah
