[Intro: Kyyngg]
Kyyngg shit hoe
You know what this shit be like, lil niggas
Praise we, bitch
I'm geeked the fuck up
Hell is you doing?

[Verse 1: Kyyngg]
Ooh, I puff it and pass it to mami
We geeking like zombies, can't fuck with you peasants
Hope 'Pac go to Heaven
While I'm pouring double cups up with the Devil
My flow MAC-11 while I'm killing beats, that's a 187
This shit is so deep, hoe, to figure it out
Bitch, you gon' need a shovel, oh
I'm geekin', I'm geekin', I'm geekin', I'm geekin', I'm geekin'
Bitch, I'ma be Kyyngg here forever, not just for a season
I smoke your bitch ass like goon, please give me a reason

[Hook: Code G & Young Thug]
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind (I'm geek'd up)
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high (I'm so high)
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high (Ooh, I'm so high)
I'm so high, I swear I'm flying like them eagles
I'm so high above the clouds, I can't see you (Thugger!)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
She text me one word (What's that?) "Pipe"
She get me out of there, her name under night night
She like, "How the hell you honor roll every time?"
Nigga, sprite dirty, red YSL wine
If you get stoned, you my kind
I might eat it on that loud
That lil bitch got some good head on her shoulders
Young Thugger wish she could rewind
I love getting high with my siblings
I ain't casino, but I'm killin' it
Two hundred bands, got me fishin' it
Bands on the steak, got 'em listenin'

[Hook: Code G & Young Thug]
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind (YSL stoners)
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I swear I'm flying like them eagles
(Mind) I can't see you

[Verse 3: Code G]
Back to back, we're smoking on repeat
Rolling baseball bat blunts full of trees
Hit it one time, I don't run, I'm geek'd
I only hit the chick one time, she sleep
Came in this bih with the nine in my jeans
I grind in the streets like I grind up the weed
Blunts stay stuffed like my pockets full of green
Take a bad ass bitch and pass her 'round through the team
Molly in her system and it's workin'
Money on the floor, got her twerkin'
Missed calls in my phone, about ten times
I been geek'd out my mind, straight lurkin'
She burpin' and I'm from the gutter
It's worth it, but I never love her
I only wanna bust, no shutter
Find me geek'd up, Code G and Young Thugger (Hey, geekin')

[Hook: Code G & Young Thug]
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind (I'm geek'd up)
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high (I'm so high)
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high (Ooh, I'm so high)
I'm so high, I swear I'm flying like them eagles
I'm so high above the clouds, I can't see you
