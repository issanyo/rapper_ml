[Chorus: Quavo & Young Thug]
Like the nineteen ninety-one (Huncho)
Like the nineteen ninety-one
Like the nineteen ninety-one (hey)
Like the nineteen ninety-one (hey)
Back in the nineteen ninety-one (woo)
Huncho on these hoes, call the fuckin’ 9 1 1
Backflip, palindromic numbers, it’s the 1991
On tank battle, crash it, Norfolk '91
Back in the nineteen ninety-one
Bad bitch on me and she knows that i’m the one (woo)
Like the nineteen ninety-one (hey)
Like the nineteen ninety-one (woo)
Like the nineteen ninety-one (hey)
Like the nineteen ninety-one (woo)
Back in the nineteen ninety-one, yeah

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Ain’t no time, bought a ‘rari, now too fast (now too fast!)
Off-White my shoes, canvas-black, Spooky Pack, yeah
Vvs on my neck, call me Flash
'91 with Deion on cornerback
12 on me, cut the phone, don't call me back, yeah
Hide it in my Gucci bag, hit the gas (hit the gas!)
