Hey
What up Camila
We gon head out to Havana?
Alright bet
Lets go, lets go, look look

I just met you
But it feels like I’ve always known you
It must be deja vu
It could be Mandela
Vamonos a Cuba
Comienza la fiesta
Levantate, bailamos
Too young to sit around
Get up out on the dance floor
And lets get down (hey)
And lets get down (hey)
And lets get down (hey)
I love the way you move your hips, so smooth
I need my dose of you
If not I might lose it
You make me go dumb like I got it from cupid
Love you like a novella
My Rosa De Guadalupe
You get me so fast
You’re destined to be my woman
Tu eres mi corazón, my heart in human form
Do it all with regal grace
You, I can’t replace
I mean it with a straight face
I don’t play
You and me, we’re a team
Back and forth, on me
Always got your back, you’re never lonely
Hop in my spaceship, or go on the cruise ship
(yeah) We can go on a trip
Take a flight down south (ooh)
We can go to Havana, thats where it is right now

Havana, ooh na-na (ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (uh huh, uh huh)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
Havana, ooh na-na (uh)

He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (uh)
(When he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (uh)
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
(That summer night in June)
And papa says he got malo in him (uh)
He got me feelin' like

Ooh-ooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na

Havana, ooh na-na (ay, ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (uh huh)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)
My heart is in Havana (ay)
Havana, ooh na-na

See we be from different places
Dont mean we gotta be at different paces
We can go together like salt and pepper
Like Mac n cheese
Like carrots and peas
Strawberries and cream
Understand what I mean?
You say you knew me in a minute, well l knew you within seconds
I don’t think you understand that you are a blessing
Lets stay in Havana
We can go to La Cabana
Take a walk and we can stroll through old Havana (yee)
Take a couple pictures, c’mon smile for the camera (yee)
Whenever I’m with you my life is like a movie
Teach me to speak foriegn baby I don’t speak it fully
I feel like a rookie, but it’ll change surely
Im with my dawg Thugger Thugger rockin in Havana
Take it back to Watts, travel east to Atlanta (what?)
East to Atlanta (what?)
Ooh ooh

Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn

Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam
Hey, I was quick to pay that girl like Uncle Sam (here you go, ay)

Get to diggin' on me (on me)
She waited on me (then what?)
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (wait up)
