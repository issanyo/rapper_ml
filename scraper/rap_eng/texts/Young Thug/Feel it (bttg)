She don't need no hand, I'ma help her
She barely keep it so I kept her
Watch me tell her

[Chorus]
If that's your man, you better hold him down
Murder she wrote

And she was popular way before me
Now that I'm popular, I'ma still be the old me
Yeah, I swear to God she wanna feel it
Yeah, when I do wrong, bae, make me feel it
