[Hook]
You ain't my thug, you ain't my round, you ain't my Blood (No love)
You ain't my thug, you ain't my round, you ain't my Blood (No love)
You ain't my thug, you ain't my round, you ain't my Blood (No love)
You ain't my Blood (No love), you ain't my Blood (No love)
You ain't my round, you ain't my thug, you ain't my Blood (No love)
You ain't my round, you ain't my thug, you ain't my Blood (No love)
You ain't my round, you ain't my thug, you ain't my Blood (No love)
You ain't my thug (No love), you ain't my thug (No love)

[Verse 1: Bloody Jay]
I know you say you want to be a thug, you ain't never been a thug
Say you want to be a Blood, we ain't 'bout to make you Blood
Say you try to be a Crip, they won't make you Cuh
You don't know nobody around here, you finna get bust
One shot, headshot, knock him out his sneakers
Molly got my whole hood up, they geekers
Two-hundred in my cup, got me slick in the Beamer
I don't do no new friends, just sneakers
Fuck your main bitch, ain't want her, don't need her
If I ain't fucked your bitch, I ain't met her, I ain't meet her
Two grams in every blunt, I'ma need more reefer
Tell the DJ hit it hard, blow the speakers
All my niggas sliming, watch them breeze you
Riding 'round the city with the AK heater
Drop a nigga, know clean slime 'bout d-up
Get four mil' and put it all in my re-up
Hustle hard, rubberband them hundreds, nigga, g-up
Ten toes down, I never put my feet up
Take my shirt off when I'm running through these streets
Lil' bitty-ass nigga, I'm a motherfucking beast
Ask about me, I'm a motherfucking g
I don't know you, nigga, I don't even want to meet
Fuck you, nigga, game over, we eat
Finna cross you out, I don't even want to speak

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Thugger, shot up, follow, Hummer
Free world, free cut, Bloody, summer
Who that? Be who? G dog
Pop a ball, pop a ball, pop a ball
Bloody, he know he gon' pop 'em all
Bloody gon' get 'em, I tried to tell 'em I'm a felon, I pop all the melons
DK go kill 'em, and we gon' beat 'em and hide 'em where people can't smell 'em
We through here, take all your cookies, go to the block and straight sell 'em
Now I done ran up the profit, I'm 'bout to go drop it on bezels
The chopper here, Thugger back right down and step 'em
He scared to draw blood, so you know that I level
It comes to that bleeding, young Thugger professional
STD, I run my warrant, AKA avenue

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bloody Jay]
Be my round, you ain't no gangster, you ain't no thug
Nigga, you a five-fifty, your ass ain't no Blood
You don't get no love, you get more slugs
We gon' sock it to a nigga, watch him get plugged
What it is, lil' slug?
And free Maybach
I remember way back, they got in for a free Maybach
That's like three-hundred racks
Whenever I bring the Bloods out, that's like three-hundred blats
Or three-hundred flags
You would you was watching Olympic trials
How them other niggas running?
But we ain't shooting in no air, we ain't trying to start no niggas up running
