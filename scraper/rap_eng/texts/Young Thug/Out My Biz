[Hook]
I know that she will, I know that she will
I might buy the bitch somethin' and get her out my business
I know that she will, hey
I gonna buy the bitch somethin' and get her out my business
And all she do is beg for me time after time
You know I got a workload baby load up all the 9s
You know you gotta work you gotta work to get your riches
We got a spot eating all the Versace dishes

[Verse 1]
Ravioli for the bitch while I eat 5,000 dollar dishes
Hit the club she got nothing on and neck, and wrists, feet glisten
You know I call it automatic because you get on top and never switch
And all the farm bitches lookin' like a woolworths with my hat I'm 'bout to go fishin'
Tony Montana my, Tony Montana my nose (whew)
Tony Montana her nose, Tony Montana her throat
Tony Montana her pussy, Tony Montana her ass
She like Tony Montana when she get on it she like to pass
Flash, twitpic for IG
She in love with gang green, she in love with king sling
All her pants they got wings, all her homies got teams
All her homies love weed, all my homies love weed

[Hook]
I know that she will, I know that she will
I might buy the bitch somethin' and get her out my business
I know that she will, hey
I gonna buy the bitch somethin' and get her out my business
And all she do is beg for me time after time
You know I got a workload baby load up all the 9s
You know you gotta work you gotta work to get your riches
We got a spot eating all the Versace dishes

[Verse 2]
Ice cream lick my collar
Lick my father lick your daughter
No baking soda brown bitch coca cola
She saw me from a range in that brand new rover
I couldn't see her at all, Toyota Corolla
Icy cola, icy cola I know I look like him but I do not know ya
But her ass clapping like she from magnolia
Black living color crayola
Black hey come and look closer
Now I wanna nail you like posters
I want you to squish that thang down on a kid
Every girl know how to do it right, I told her
When she on top baby move that thang around for the kid
And everything I tell her to do she never did

[Hook]
I know that she will, I know that she will
I might buy the bitch somethin' and get her out my business
I know that she will, hey
I gonna buy the bitch somethin' and get her out my business
And all she do is beg for me time after time
You know I got a workload baby load up all the 9s
You know you gotta work you gotta work to get your riches
We got a spot eating all the Versace dishes
