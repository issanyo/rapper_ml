[Produced by London on da Track]

[Intro]
(Thugger, Thugger)
Chillin' at the top, cloud nine
Only cash, guap, I-I-I-I-I came a long way
(We got London on da Track)

[Verse]
I be chillin', I be chillin' all the way
Nigga winnin' all my diamonds black like Spades
I'mma hit it and then pass it to my bae
Nigga diamond water like a fuckin' lake
100k the day I caught a bitch straight out the Bay
100k the day I whip that sniff straight off the Bay
100k the day I fucked that bitch straight from the Bay
Cum-cum-cum all over her mothafuckin' face
I'mma get married anyway
I'mma hit it, yeah I'mma hit it just to say (ooh wee)
She, she plannin' on leaving me no, no way (ooh wee)
Aye, aye, ayeeee (ooh wee, ooh wee)
I-I-I came a long way (ooh wee, ooh wee)

[Hook]
Chilling at the top, Cloud 9
Only cash, guap, beside mine
Feel kinda rocky, I got a molly I'mma take off with nobody
Won't tell nobody if you give me some of that body
Oooooh, let me touch all over yo' body
She'll pay you if I touch all over her body
I will kill if you touch all over her body
Touch all over yo' body, touch all over yo' body

[Interlude]
Ooooh, ooh
I'mma touch all over yo' body, oooh
Aye, Nay bring me the lighter and a blunt

[Hook]
Chilling at the top, Cloud 9
Only cash, guap, beside mine
Feel kinda rocky, I got a molly I'mma take off with nobody
Won't tell nobody if you give me some of that body
Oooooh, let me touch all over yo' body
She'll pay you if I touch all over her body
I will kill if you touch all over her body
Touch all over yo' body, touch all over yo' body


[Outro]
I just wanna pay you, girl you make me pay
I just wanna pay you, sing my name like Tank
I just wanna pay you (chillin' at the top)
Hey, heyyyy, yeah
Pay you, pay you myself
I wanna pay you, pay you myself
I wanna pay you my damn self
I wanna pay you my damn self, for real (ooh wee)
If I for real (ooh wee)
If I, If I for real (ooh wee)
Ferrari for real (ooh wee)
