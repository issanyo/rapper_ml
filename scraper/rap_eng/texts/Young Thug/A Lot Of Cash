Racks on racks, Y Season

I'm one of the biggest bloods in America you know them
Boys can't see me

Church, I'm sliding like a decan
Suck my cum or I'm leaving
Hot as a pepper, no pizza
Hundreds thousand dollars ima pull up on that bitch blowin loud like a parade
Pussy nigga play I'm running back with the K, Ima gorilla no bae bae
I gets lot of cash, I gets lot of cash
Shows the bitches cash, she like shit!, no ass
All i know is math, all i know is math
Give a teacher math she gone make sure I pass
