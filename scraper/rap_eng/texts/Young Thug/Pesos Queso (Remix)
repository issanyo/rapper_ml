[Verse 1: Young Thug]
God damn I’m after pesos
And I’m screamin' SOS, not say so
She cannot get in my head nor my bro
She can’t even get in my bed when my eyes closed
I'ma shoot right back at 5 0
Chillin' with my Chinese bitch, look like her eyes closed
Then I dodged her call like a pothole
I pull off fast like a racer
My shoes and my blunt laced
Racks longer than the street
After my show I count my money like a geek
Haha, won't tell my ties where she at
She only want me to buy her some new needs
I ride fast, do 100 in the street, ay
It ain’t nothin' if you fuck with a G, ay
Would you ride for the cat
Go 'gainst a tribe with the cat
Claim 5 like a jack
Run to the motherfuckin' top
I'ma wet my Rollie with a GTV vodka
I'ma catch a ride, I'ma die for the flock
Runnin' down the rose, spend a thous' on the flock
Shawty callin' my phone
Therefore I gave her 25 hundred for a quarter
Shad, what do they do?

[Hook: Shad Da God]
Life good nigga, life good bitch
I'm hood rich, fuck it I be hood rich
SK, 30 clip got 2 of 'em and the handle wood, bitch
I'm hood rich, fuck it I be hood rich
But I'm 'bout the pesos
I'm 'bout the pesos, I'm' bout the pesos
Ridin' 'round runnin' up the queso
I want the queso, I want the queso
Fuck a ho I'm makin' me a bank roll my wife
Ooh baby where you been all my life?
Aw man I'm 'bout the pesos
I'm 'bout the pesos, I'm 'bout the pesos oh

[Verse 2: Shad Da God]
Look, I be gettin' money 'n' I ain't pick up the phone
I was prolly gettin' money
Posted on the block with a bad bitch from Texas
She was slurpin' on my cock ooh
Get some head in the hood still pick up the phone, still bust a juug
Say the trap where I'm rollin'
Had to pump up my tires, had to tighten up my lug
Hit the club wit' some killer ice
I told that bitch to pop it open like a Miller Light
I had a bitch, I loved that bitch more than some purple Sprite
I had to let that bitch go, she wanna be in the lights
I'm ridin' down Peachtree, past Gladys Knight
I seen the police on my left you know I bucked a right
I had the 40 on my left, the nina on my right
Don't gamble with your life cause that shit just like rollin' dice
And boy the streets where I from colder than some ice
I swear to God you will get fucked over right now
The only thing I heard sleepin' at my momma's house
"Bap! Bap! Bap! Bap! Bap!"
Who the fuck that is bussin' on my damn street?
A nigga must'a just got wet up like a damn leak
I know you hear the same shit when you in your hood
That’s how you know we from the damn street, but life good though

[Hook: Shad Da God]
Life good nigga, life good bitch
I'm hood rich, fuck it I be hood rich
SK, 30 clip got 2 of 'em and the handle wood, bitch
I'm hood rich, fuck it I be hood rich
But I'm 'bout the pesos
I'm 'bout the pesos, I'm' bout the pesos
Ridin' 'round runnin' up the queso
I want the queso, I want the queso
Fuck a ho I'm makin' me a bank roll my wife
Ooh baby where you been all my life?
Aw man I'm 'bout the pesos
I'm 'bout the pesos, I'm 'bout the pesos oh
