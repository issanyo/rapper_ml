[Young Thug]

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I'm not passing on you, girl I'm smashing on you
Got a spot? Let me come crash it on you
Take you out of that simple fashion on you
Bought you rings and now you flashing on them
Get in that pussy try not to slip
Girl you know I'm lay, no chips
Yes sir I want your sauce, (What?) dip
Thugga thugga swimming (thugga thugga swimming)
That Florida water, that Florida water
She's like I told ya
Baby girl you know I like my bitch brown like sodas
And you know it's gonna be a war, she don't like my soldiers
Big mink, she's a puller
And out of all this Florida water Young Thug and them the coolest (Pffff...)
She wanna go from left to right
She wanna go from day to night
Everytime I do it again she's tight
Florida water, right

Ok my jewelry, Florida water, Florida water, Florida water

[Verse 2: Bloody Jay]
Let's go be free
Just you and me
How it's supposed to be
I just want you close to me
I can sit here with you all day
I got enough money, we can stay
An extra day, an extra week
Shit girl, you're a freak
That thang wet, it got a little leak
That girl ain't no good, that's a little creek
And the hoes call me an asshole, they say I'm a creep
But I’m Zach Morris cool, and you’re just Screech
