[Bridge]
Baby you a turn on!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Baby you a turn on
Imma put my trust inside of your heart
Baby you a turn on
I knew I was falling in love from the start
Baby you a turn on
I've been slowly waiting
Ain't no hesitating
Girl my heart racing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing

[Verse 1]
Girl I'm slowly waiting, I'm not hesitating
I can't tell her nothing, I want to have your babies
Oops I meant I want you to have my babies, ain't no pretending
Girl I'm winning, girl you winning, baby let's get it...Jenny
Pockets on Craig, I'm higher, I'm flyer
They mad, cause I ain't deny you, they gone hate
They gone try you,  my pockets on Weight Watch
My heart beat faster than a stopwatch, she want to stop by
She want to pop lock, she want a drop top
She the top notch (order top notch!) I couldn't fucking leave
She was looking for me like a fucking cop
She throwing up signs, no stop

[Hook]
Baby you a turn on
Imma put my trust inside of your heart
Baby you a turn on
I knew I was falling in love from the start
Baby you a turn on
I've been slowly waiting
Ain't no hesitating
Girl my heart racing
I can't tell her nothing[8x]

[Verse 2]
Be quiet, I can't tell her nothing, STFU
You can't tell her nothing, I blow bands on her
I spent lettuce on her, buy her yellow diamonds, she's a damn Corona
I'm in Atlantic station, I'm geeked up
She got patients for me she got to wait for me
Imma be with her until we ancient, ya see?
She got big ol' buggers on her ankle and feet
And she ain't no hooker but she dancing for me
She accept my partner even though he a thief
Molly tan! Don't end it
And she like to hold my hand we in Lenox
She want to show out on all these bitches at M's
I know she bad for Young Thugger Thugger black cannon
I go slow like Iâ€™m screwed, I go fast like a semi

[Hook]
Baby you a turn on
Imma put my trust inside of your heart
Baby you a turn on
I knew I was falling in love from the start
Baby you a turn on
I've been slowly waiting
Ain't no hesitating
Girl my heart racing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
