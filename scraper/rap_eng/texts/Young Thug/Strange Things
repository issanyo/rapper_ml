[Hook]
She say she won't drink her some lean
Do you know lean make you do strange things
Girl you know I love to do strange things
I love to do strange things
I love to do it
F-R-F-R, for real I love it
Slow down, baby girl slow iiit down
No weed baby, roll it around
Earn you a brand new coupe today

[Verse 1]
You can still ask Kunte
Now you flexing just like Lex Luger babe
I'm gone off lean, I'm a real lean mean
If this is a dream lets get it, oh, oh, baby
My diamonds in the booth just shaking
Ain't got no time to starve cause all my homies done take it
And I'm so tired of hearing bout prison, I really hope I make it
Free UnFunk, free my nigga Haze
Know the streets begging for them
This world really gay, good leave young, free TayTay
Lets get it

[Hook]
She say she won't drink her some lean
Do you know lean make you do strange things
Girl you know I love to do strange things
I love to do strange things
I love to do it
F-R-F-R, for real I love it
Slow down, baby girl slow iiit down
No weed baby, roll it around
Earn you a brand new coupe today

[Verse 2]
AK-47 that's a long horn
Hold a hundred grams inside my long johns
Brown Tru's today with these Air Force ones
Two fifty shots, these not Air Force ones
100 thousand ones off in DOA (Guwop)
I don't know your name but I will bust your brain
I don't know your name, but I'll fuck your main dame
Hit her from the back, and chain swing
Who are you, what the fuck it do?
Soo-Crew, suwoop, it ain't nothing blue
I'm chopping my Reeses to pieces
I'm fucking these rich niggas nieces
I put on my Lebron South Beaches
Then hop off in that foreign feature

[Hook]
She say she won't drink her some lean
Do you know lean make you do strange things
Girl you know I love to do strange things
I love to do strange things
I love to do it
F-R-F-R, for real I love it
Slow down, baby girl slow iiit down
No weed baby, roll it around
Earn you a brand new coupe today

[Outro]
Baby girl slow it down, slow down
Baby girl slow it down, slow down
Baby girl slow it down
Baby girl slow it down
