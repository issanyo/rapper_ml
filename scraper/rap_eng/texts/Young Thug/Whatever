[Hook: Rich Homie Quan + Young Thug]
I forever stack this money all over these bitches
I forever keep a 100 thou stacked inside my britches
I'll forever put them crystals inside of my bezelsTo flex on these country niggas I sell 'em whatever
Bitches I tell 'em whatever
Niggas I sell 'em whatever
Bitches I tell 'em whatever
Niggas I sell 'em whatever
Money more cheddar, more cheddar
I'm up so high I need a ladder

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
I'm up so high I need a ladder
Money longer than a motherfucker right now
I been fucking with Wayne ever since the Hot Boys remember lights out
And it's the same, everybody rapping but it ain't hot now
And I've been playing games with lil shawty
I just want her right now
Be patient, where the fuck you move to baby
Be ailing, pussy drier than a raisin
And I swear to God from the backseat, can't take it
I got money to the ceiling
From the back I make her feel it
Tell them hoes stay out our business
Tell them hoes I'm serious
Thugger that my sibling
MOB the realest

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan + Young Thug]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan + Young Thug]
How you pulled up slime?
Me? I pulled up flexin' in a coupe
Oooh, I swear to God we livin' better
Don't hate, these niggas make me drop the roof
In the winter time nigga, so I got on a sweater
Gas so loud I can't hear you
100 bitches around, Quan hit it
Nigga money stacked to the ceiling
Til I can't stack it no more
Marvin Gaye sexual healing
Shawty won't gooooooo
And that ain't (?)
Cause I smile and show my golds
Pullin' up at Kinko's, if you didn't know that's Japanese food
Do it all for you, you, you, you

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan + Young Thug]

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan + Young Thug]
I can't come down right now cause I need a ladder
I ain't comin' down right now, I need some wheels and a pedal)
All my niggas at that tables
All of our bread up
Cain and Abel
We ain't kill nobody
We just got birds, no Robin
Diamonds froze like Baskin Robbins
On my soul ain't tell nobody
Thugger how you feel bruh?
You know just how niggas feel niggasI'm not a buffalo but I'm stackin' these bills nigga
Nigga, nigga
