[Intro: Young Thug]
Aye man flippa what that fuck goin on
This yo brotha, Thugga Thugga nahm' sayin'
Flippa Flippin', Always Trippin'
Never slippin', drippin', never crippin'
You understand what I'm sayin', You digg
Yeah I keep my shit on me, nahm sayin'
You understand, Real heavy
You understand,  Still Havin' you know

[Hook: Skippa Da Flippa]
Flippa!
Fucked a model bitch but I had other options (smash)
75 a show and the price never dropped it
Most of you rappers you biting you plotting
What you gone do when that k get to knockin'
1008 needles got cash like The Beatles
Don't let the fame get to ya
Money bring evil
Don't be surprised if you hear Flip through your speakers
Pick a foreign up in a foreign take her to cheetah
You biting big Meech for the cash
I hit my trap spot 200 on the dash
Would you do anything to get the cash
30 pints of the Phoenix I think I'm Steve Nash
Would you do anything to get the cash
Would you hit a brinks truck where and how fast?
Would you hit em bareface and don't use no mask?
When you're down bad you'll do anything for the cash

[Verse 1: Skippa Da Flippa]
What would you do for the paper
If you's like me you'll hit em like takers
A couple racks and I drop off at bakers
I don't new friends cause they turn to traitors
The yen, dinero the mula, the peso
Chopper got the waffle fries turn you to eggo
Drop a duece drink it slow
Cotton Candy Faygo
Stay with a trey and a duece Oj Mayo
How does it feel to know you ain't got shit
Remember to stay humble when you get rich
Kylie Irving press the brick with a stick
Stay away from you lames I ain't signed up for this shit
Went from condo crib back to havin' nothin'
If you can hustle turn nothing to something
Make 10k right you think this was my function
Pull out the Chevelle and stunt on spaghetti junction
[Hi-Tech] I'm sippin' that watson is so [?]
She said she got lock jaw give me some more head
I am the man of the year thats enough said
Even though I'm rich, I'mma call her like I got no bread
When you hit a jugg better pay attention
1500 cash if you can complete the mission
Chances and choices make the right decisions
I invented pimping for a show [?] a chicken

[Hook: Skippa Da Flippa]

Don't let the fame get to ya, money bring evil

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Rollie Rollie fully time piece
60 pointers baby a dime piece
Anything about the cash see
Line around the corner busy bee
Trappin, trappin Nigga serving chickens
Trapping, trapping Nigga fuckin Bitches
Trappin lawyers want a quarter ticket
Sell the Dolphins nigga Jada Pinkett
Dead broke runnin off with chickens
Quarter milli runnin off with chickens
Stacking bread like a fuckin biscuit
Million cash Burnin off on bitches
Fifty bracks I exhaust the Bentley
Smoking gas Nigga, coughing livin'
I'm livin' fast, no fucks given
I'm eating good nigga Thanksgiving (Mmm)
Wish you woulda, nigga woulda coulda
Thirty thousand for the ear booker
I stuff my trouser with some damn books
No library, bitch I'm a damn booker
Hah, you digg?
Pussy niggas might squeal to the pigs
Shh I ain't talking wig
But I might throw that sig at your lid
