[Intro:]

Aye, yeah

Run up that,  run up that
Run up them digits, we run up that money
We run up them digits, we run up that...
Aye

[verse:]

When I'm gone I hope they remember me like Kobe
Just a young boy putting on for the OG's
We got smoke there if a boy talks smokey
Now them bitches calling saying they miss the old me

Bitches love me like I'm sosa
Niggas love me like I'm KD
Look how they hated on me
Now they vouching for me cah they know the boy too wavey

Hit the club and get my juice on
Dip and dabbing, I been dip and dabbing
I just dip and dap up to my new song
Plus that rum and ginger had me waving

Need that money, need them payments
Came from gutter, the pavement
Moved out the ends when I was 11, the hood never left me let's face it

Plenty niggas I know vouch for me
The otherside got their style from me
Told them niggas wait their turn, this shit far from finished
Suggest you don't doubt on me


[bridge:]

I know plenty niggas out there, they been plotting on me
They want my wave, they want my juice
Can't take these bangers from me

I know Happy, I know Momrelle
They was vouching for me

I know KayG, I know Leon
They was vouching for me


[hook:]

We ran up them digits we ran up the money
We ran up them digits we ran up that money
We ran up them digits we ran up that money
We ran up them digits we ran up the money
We ran up them digits we ran up some money
We ran up some digits we ran up some money


[bridge:]

I know plenty niggas out there, they been plotting on me
They want my wave, they want my juice
Can't take these bangers from me

I know Happy, I know Momrelle
They was vouching for me

I know KayG, I know Leon
They was vouching for me


[verse2:]

Bitch I really got them waves, yeah
Pree the way I hit my dab, yeah
Mum don't believe in the vision
Nah she don't believe in the man
Walk through the ends like I'm famous
Local legend, understand?
Need a peng girl like Serena
She don't love me for the bands

Need to hit them for the visuals
For The Gyaldem, got it bagged
EP, it's coming, it's coming
She gimme that good till I'm cumming

I know Happy, I know Momrelle
They was vouching for me

I know Leon, I know KayG
They was vouching for me


[hook:]

We ran up them digits we ran up the money
We ran up them digits we ran up that money
