[Hook: Lil Durk]
Pussy boy, you ain't been a threat
Talkin' trash, boy you been doin' that
Yo' baby momma, boy we've been in that
You ain't even bought a Bentley yet
Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat
Street niggas gettin' Rapchat
Ask 'em 'bout that boy I'm 'bout that
You just do it for the internet
You just do it for the internet
You just do it for the internet
You just do it for the internet
You just do it for the internet
You just do it for the internet
You just do it for the internet
You just do it for the internet
You just do it for the internet

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
You a killa with a gun emoji
And yo' baby daddy been a goofy
They bossin' over Cali, eatin' sushi
Brown Yeezys on me, color dookie
Took a point, wanna hang me
In the trenches where I'm famous
Bank broke, that's the same shit
Switch-a-roo that's the same shit
Snap me threats like I'm worried 'bout 'em
Fineese his ass, got the syrup out 'em
20k for a 16
He ain't never got a verse out 'em
The other side we ain't worried 'bout 'em
Tell them bitches we don't care about 'em
Hit the bank get some bills out it
Hit the hood with Benzs Matic
She wanna suck me 'til my kids fall
Cut her off like a jigsaw
Suck me up, face eggnog
'Lil Durk but I'm a big dawg
Twitter niggas wanna kill me
Instagram wanna kill me
Snapchat wanna kill me
Periscope wanna kill me (Gang!)

[Verse 2: Young Thug & Lil Durk]
I'm drinkin' Act, not no Similac
Used to be broke, you remember that
My diamonds cold like December back
In the back of the hoe like a centerback
I was just run with the purple bag
Man I was just riding with that loud pack
I got four hoes on the top of me
Man I gotta take me a virgin
You got a fat ass, she gon' shake it
I don't want no fat on yo' waist, yeah
You talkin' that shit on the 'Gram
It's never same thing that it's tagged me in yeah
You on Snapchat goin' crazy
I fuck around, go in and embrace it
Ain't nobody seein' yo' Facebook
That shit movin' slow as the Matrix
Fuck around and take her to the basement
Fuck around and blast on yo' face, yeah
Fuck around and clear this place, yeah
Fuck around and buy MySpace
I'm chargin' 100 bands a day
You can invade my space, yeah
Tough talkin' we ain't in to that
(Pussy boy you ain't been a threat)
