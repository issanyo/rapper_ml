[Intro]
L-O-V-E
For life

[Chorus]
Love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Gotta ride for your team
Nigga play you busting
And I got me a high self esteem
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

[Post-Chorus]
Love
Love, love, love

[Verse 1]
Big old digits with me
Big old Bentley with me
Big old bitches with me
S gang chino with me with me
I got 3 stripes, Adidas with me, with me
All of my creatures with me, with me
I got some features with me, with me
Big racks and that Aether with me, with me (racks)
Tote that like it's legal woody, woody
I look that shit up 'bout a thousand times
This bitch Master P cause she 'bout it, 'bout it
That boy got cheap rims on a cheap Jeep
Just make sure you tell him his hoe a freak
Iâ€™m sitting at the top of the nose bleeds
And I got my gold off of Goldie
Work it, twerk it baby, you have to hold me, wait for home
Wake up to Young Thug
Have you ever been a shot caller? (Have you ever?)
Proceed to the room, leave em stalkin'

[Chorus]
Love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Gotta ride for your team
Nigga play you busting
And I got me a high self esteem
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

[Post-Chorus]
Love
Love, love, love

[Verse 2]
SOB, SOB, SOB
That's on me, that's on me
That's on me, that's on me
Bands on me, bands on me
Turn up for the girls
Turn up for the boys
Turn up for the club
Turn up on the drugs
Turn up on the molly
Turn up on the Xan
Turn up on a perky, give it to my man
Here, give it to your clan
I put on my mink I'm like a lamb
Stop trying to impress these fuckin' cams
I'm comin' for mine, Uncle Sam
I'm turnin' money into power
We not from here we need a browser
You just squirt, squirt
I know you don't want none, coward
I'm studyin' like a bookworm
I'm tryna count at least a hundred bands (racks)
And I wanna just buy some bigger land, yeah

[Chorus]
Love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Gotta ride for your team
Nigga play you busting
And I got me a high self esteem
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

[Post-Chorus]
Love
Love, love, love
