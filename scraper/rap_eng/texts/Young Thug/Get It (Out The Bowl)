[Intro]
Turn the music up in my headphones, turn the intro up
Ya digg
Aye this for the real trap stars know what I'm saying, all the real niggas that trap
I ain't never really had to trap know what I'm saying, we was robbing and shit
I was on before I knew it
Know what I'm saying, I didn't even have to time trap, ya digg

[Hook]
Get it out that bowl, get it out the bowl
Get it out the bowl, get it out that bowl
Whip it out the bowl, whip it out that bowl
Whip it out that bowl, do it out that bowl
Front it to your folks, front it to your folks
Front it to your folks, front it to your folks
Make a lil more, make a lil more
Take a lil more, make a lil more

[Verse 1]
Blow it, blow it, blow it
Blow a lot of cash
Blow it, blow it, blow it
Hundred racks on her ass
Hold up-up, back the fuck back
Got the blower with me, hundred on the mac
King-King Slime with a bunch of bad guys
Booling on that Bleveland with a bunch of red flags
I'm in [?] sprinkling ones to the cab
Upset stomach, diarrhea watch me shit
Sprinkle sprinkle nigga's bitches
Winky winky, monkey nigga
Penny pinching, drinking Ac', I'm pinkin'
My wrist a Lincoln, my neck a new minky
I promise, pinky
Jewelry, freezing

[Hook]
Get it out that bowl, get it out the bowl
Get it out the bowl, get it out that bowl
Whip it out the bowl, whip it out that bowl
Whip it out that bowl, do it out that bowl
Front it to your folks, front it to your folks
Front it to your folks, front it to your folks
Make a lil more, make a lil more
Take a lil more, make a lil more

[Verse 2]
Run up your folks and go make a lil more
Niggas can't act like they tough and they told
You ain't from the [?] what you bluffing for?
Pump faking might get you shot in your throat
Eeny meeny miny let's go
I got bread like I'm zesto
Bless my niggas, I don't bless hoes
She drink the nut, she don't flush those
Rollie timeless icey, muhfucka
Ride that dick Kawasaki, speed boat
Studio, lot of bad hoes, lot of pink toes
Stop acting like you getting money when you need those
Big bad, big bone, big strap, bomb-bomb
None my niggas not bomb-bombs
Make them bitches give 'em all something
Take 'em to the mall or something
Upgrade her drive or something
Upgrade her closet for something
Then send her home

[Hook]
Get it out that bowl, get it out the bowl
Get it out the bowl, get it out that bowl
Whip it out the bowl, whip it out that bowl
Whip it out that bowl, do it out that bowl
Front it to your folks, front it to your folks
Front it to your folks, front it to your folks
Make a lil more, make a lil more
Take a lil more, make a lil more
