[Chorus: Gunna & Young Thug]
Extended clip, I cannot miss
I took a risk, I done got rich
My jewelry's crisp, shit on your bitch
Ice out your wrist, ayy
Make you a wish, blow me a kiss
I sip the six, bottles of it
I don't get Chris, I'm high as it get
Addys and grits, ayy
Don't play with it
I'm clutchin' all day with it
Smoke 'em and slay with it
AK, SK with me
My homies my backbone
I'm gettin' my racks on
Don't play with it
Better not play with it

[Verse 1: Young Thug & Gunna]
I'm slayin' your lady
I just came out to tell you I made it
We shootin' at the coppers
If they come to the spot, tryna raid it
Hurricane blue bitch
Bitch green like my loot, yeah
Black diamonds on me like the tint on the coupe, yeah
Penthouse suite, me and my crew, yeah
We all in her mouth, she like rude sex
Quick, take an addy, she don't do X
She say ooh zaddy, I like your new Patek (let's go)
Addy addy addy, addy addy addy
I took another one yeah, DJ Khaled took another one, yeah
Got new Gucci's on, yeah
Look like I'm 'bout to go bungee jumping, yeah
Addy addy addy, addy addy addy
I sip lean on her dresses, woo-ooh
Red monkey jeans, ain't a blessin', woo-ooh
These niggas so mad they steamin' for nothin', woo-ooh
Got princess cuts on me
I put Celine all on on they faces, hmm
I iced the toasters like I'm precious, hmm
I took a jet across the nation, hmm
Put princess cuts inside my bracelet, hmm

[Chorus: Gunna & Young Thug]
Extended clip, I cannot miss
I took a risk, I done got rich
My jewelry's crisp, shit on your bitch
Ice out your wrist, ayy
Make you a wish, blow me a kiss

[Verse 2: Young Thug & Gunna]
Fuckin' with the dog, it be Russian Roulette
I got tints on the coupe, same color as the TEC
Got an old lady, and we pillow talk, ooh
Eighty pointer on my nizzeck, yeah nothin' but baguettes
I spent thirty-five hundred on a Louis crewneck
Call some slimes, get you whacked, it's gonn cost a cool rack
Pillow talkin' in the Maybach, oh
Livin' large and really rich, oh
I'm addicted to this money
Go apeshit like Harambe
Catch me drippin', swag my fengshui
Gettin' money every other day
Count that money, ain't shit nothin' fake
Top floor condo, won't you come and stay
Keep a hundred, don't you ever pay

[Chorus: Gunna & Young Thug]
Extended clip, I cannot miss
I took a risk, I done got rich
My jewelry's crisp, shit on your bitch
Ice out your wrist, ayy
Make you a wish, blow me a kiss
I sip the six, bottles of it
