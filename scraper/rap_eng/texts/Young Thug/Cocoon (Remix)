[Intro: Young Thug]
Brand new Fubu, ooh-ohh
Fat Albert on the side of my shoes, ooh-ohh
Big teeth right in front of my Loubs', oh-ohh
Goin' monkey like a fuckin baboon, oh-ohh
HAAA!
(Thugger!)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Rag top, nigga, fuck around and say
Shot up right up your block, (Shot right up your block)
Every time I pull up the LIV, I'm in a half a million dollar car (Skrt skrt skrt)
Kick rocks, nigga, get away from my boys (kick rocks nigga)
I'm bleedin' red, man I'm bleedin' bad
Shawty winnin', ballin' out
Take a molly then I stall out
She tried to put my dogs in her dog house
When they smell fear you know they poppin' off
I'ma go and fuck your daughter study law
I'ma stand for what I believe till I fall
If I never said it, I'm sayin' it right now
Say what you want I'ma shed my pride now
Everybody say fuck the feds and five-o
Gave everybody theirs itâ€™s mine now
I'ma make a public announcement, call now
Turn to a blood, them A's went down now
Kinda good lookin', them bitches fine now
I'ma drip some red on the sauna
I'ma cop the bread when it's all gone
I get a machete on for you
Sleepin' on that bitch like I'm comfortable

[Hook: Quavo]
When I take drugs I go to the moon
Lil' spoiled bitch, 2000 on shoes
Walk in the club with one bitch, leave with two
By myself at the top like cocoon
When I'm in the coupe I feel like a cocoon
Designer gifts red bottoms baboon
We the wave, we the wave, typhoon
Take her out of the hills to fuck with some goons
Now she breaking pounds in my room

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I put the fours on em
Came from juggin' with bowl homie
Now look all this rose gold, gold yellow gold, gold, gold on me
Yeah mob ties frog eyes
What a time to be alive
No neighbors
House on the hill with the acres
Don't date her
Running through the squad slave her
I'm the mayor
President Huncho a player
Twin chopper Sonic and Tails
Twin chopper Sonic and Tails
Niggas love when the birds sing
White cocaine Pinky and the Brain
Love when the box hit the mail
I love when the player wanna bail
I hate when a nigga want problems
But I love to give a nigga shells
God protect me from the evil
Take the squad out the cheetahs
Streets crawling like beetles
But the Stanley Steamer keep me cleaner
You got it out the mud I got it out the oil
You heard the cash prince niggas on Forbes
I'm the plug, extension cord
Got your favorite model on drugs If you ain't know it

[Hook: Quavo]
When I take drugs I go to the moon
Lil' spoiled bitch, 2000 on shoes
Walk in the club with one bitch, leave with two
By myself at the top like cocoon
When I'm in the coupe I feel like a cocoon
Designer gifts red bottoms baboon
We the wave we the wave typhoon
Take her out of the hills to fuck with some goons
Now she breaking pounds in my room

[Verse 3: Offset]
Ay, I ain't tryna save 'em
Momma said don't let em' no where you lay at
Old bitches back in the day use to play bad
I'm a pull up flexing in the Maybach
Northside nigga but we bought the A back
I'm a beat the motherfucker make his face flat
Hit it from the back back baby throw it back
Have a heart attack, can you handle that?
Maison Margiela dabbin' on everybody
I'm on the codeine moving like a dead body
Bad bitch went to college but she real thotty
That's the reason I can't even trust nobody
Celine and supreme I'm the dab daddy
She coming home with me when she mad at ya'
Sucking on me buckling my knees throw a bag at ya'
Molly feel like Hercules when a nigga jab at ya'
Hold on wait, Hopping in the Wraith
Stars in the ceiling like I'm living out of space
Manoeuvre like a boss we don't ever leave a trace
Dirty Diana the chopper keep a nigga safe
Fucking a model bitches big booty little waist
I'm putting the money over these bitches any day
This one for the people that taking drugs everyday
Fuck what they say let the pain go away

[Hook: Quavo]
When I take drugs I go to the moon
Lil' spoiled bitch, 2000 on shoes
Walk in the club with one bitch, leave with two
By myself at the top like cocoon
When I'm in the coupe I feel like a cocoon
Designer gifts red bottoms baboon
We the wave we the wave typhoon
Take her out of the hills to fuck with some goons
Now she breaking pounds in my room

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Pinky codeine and mushrooms
Sweep a nigga like I was a broom
I be going up like a balloon
Chop a nigga with the bamboo in Cancun
20 bitches runnin' 'round nude
I fuck her bottom we fuckin' them by the two
I got water drippin' out my jewels
If it ain't Actavis nigga it ain't approved
Migo the gang we will never lose
So many bitches might catch me on Shade room
Got a Pit bull thinking 'bout copping a Baboon
Free all my niggas like a movie they coming soon
When I'm in the coupe I feel like I'm in a cacoon
Ten bitches ready up at the Boom Boom Room
Actin' a John but I ain't Tune
Takeoff!

[Hook: Quavo]
When I take drugs I go to the moon
Lil' spoiled bitch, 2000 on shoes
Walk in the club with one bitch, leave with two
By myself at the top like cocoon
When I'm in the coupe I feel like a cocoon
Designer gifts red bottoms baboon
We the wave we the wave typhoon
Take her out of the hills to fuck with some goons
Now she breaking pounds in my room
