[Intro: Young Thug]
I just sipped and I can't do nothin'
Yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got big racks in my jeans (Big racks in my jeans)
I'ma mix some dirty with this clean (Dirty with this clean)
Almost all my bitches ballin', no Lou King
21, I'm 'bout to stunt on all your dreams (Stuntin', yeah)
This money better not stop (Ayy)
I hit the target with the bullseye
(Hit my target, hittin' my target, hittin' my target)
Loot on the pigs every time
(Hittin' my target, hittin' my target, hittin' my target)
Me and my dawgs gon' ride out
(Hit my target, hittin' my target, hittin' my target)
Me and my dawgs gon' ride, uh
(Target, hittin' my target, yeah)
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Money talk like Charlie Sheen, yeah
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Spend your bonus on my lean, yeah
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
This money callin' me in my sleep
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Don't trust a rich nigga that creep, yeah
Run that back, Turbo
Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I was daydreamin' 'bout money, then I woke up
I be thinkin' all this pimpin' give the world to her
If I ever get the check, give you the world, girl
See us goin' up and down, roller coaster
I'll be the FN, you be my holster
Tell the city 'bout my love, I even post her
Pourin' all this lean in my styrofoam cup
4 Pockets Full, every one of these shows

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got big racks in my jeans (Big racks in my jeans)
I'ma mix some dirty with this clean (Dirty with this clean)

Boss you up and put your condo in the trees
I bought some Gucci socks so long they can reach my knees
Got a bust down Rollie with big racks inside my jeans, oh
