[Pre-Hook: Duke]
Let me stand up in that pussy like I'm on a ladder
Beat that thang up, sideways, up, down and backwards
I just get that head and get ghost, they should call me Casper
I got that money on my mind, if it ain't 'bout money it don't matter
Real stand-up nigga, no comedy
Everywhere, these bitches see us, man, I swear that they runnin'
Two bossed up and I can't look back, I can't run out no money
And I give back to my hood and my homies passin' out hunnids

[Hook: Duke]
That's what we call paying homage
These niggas act like they want it
Pull up with choppers, we want it
Most of all the niggas I run with be wanted
Pull up, spray, I'm on nawf side, that's my condolence

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Bring it to the Thugger, meet me on Gresham, new gold medal
These bitches ain't know who know better
My whole crew better, I treat 'em like they special
And that's because they is, cook fish scale with skill
And my weed kinda loud like a motherfuckin' pill
Ooh, I want to spend my night wit' you
I want to spend my life wit' you
I want to ride my bike wit' you
I want a wife and girl it's you
I will stand up for you like Moses
I do my best and yeah, she notice it
Said, 'Only got one face, ain't no emoji'
I swear to god this ain't no bogus shit
Even though I'm hot, I got the coldest wrist
I made a million and she know about it
I showed my brother little bitch and he didn't know about it

[Interlude: Duke]
Real nigga since day one, I can't switch up
Always stood up in my hood, no, I can't bitch up
Took a flight to the West Coast, bitch, I'm back in 6-0
