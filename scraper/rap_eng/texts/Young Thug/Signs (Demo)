[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (no)
I'm goin' on them once I get going (goin' on them, get going)

[Chorus: Drake & Young Thug (both)]
She tryna take it all off for me (tryna take it all off)
Tryna stay real close to me (she tryna stay real close)
I gotta catch myself (I gotta catch myself)
I can't play myself
I need to take it easy
Easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Railiza
You need a money and visa
And you get what you want, always from me
I can't say, "No", when you say, "Please"
I can't say, "No"
How you shine?
You need a baby with me, uh
And I'm takin' my time, just wait, don't leave
I can't say, "No" when you say, "Please"
I can't say, "No"
You wanna drink like Bajan and dance like Trini, yeah
You want a supermodel pose like mi real friend Winnie (like mi real friend)
Yeah, vacation's done, but I'm not finished, no

[Pre-Chorus: Drake & Young Thug]
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning (pardon)
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (no)
I'm goin' on them once I get going (goin' on them, get going)

[Chorus: Drake & Young Thug (both)]
She tryna take it all off for me (tryna take it all off)
Tryna stay real close to me (she tryna stay real close)
I gotta catch myself (I gotta catch myself)
I can't play myself
I need to take it easy
Easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I bet I never disrespect you, darlin', uh
I bet you pardon me, darlin'
I see you roamin', ridin'
Work outfit on, she ain't joggin'
Yeah, I see right through your body
You need a young nigga to give you guidance
She say I'm the youngest, but I treat her the nicest
She tryna take it all off of me
She tryna do it in call for me
She tryna start young dog
I plan on fuckin' every girl in the world, but I'm takin' it easy
Easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, mhmm
I raised change for you, I gave all my stain to you
You know I bang for you
Even my main know I got a thing for you
Walked on a aisle, anyday for you
I'll go under maintainin' for you
Jump when you say, like a kangaroo
Cryin' over you, you ain't even knew
You let me wear your watch, then I fucked a girl in it
We danced drunk then we hurlin'
She presented a gift with a shit-face
I plan on fuckin' every girl in the place, but I'm takin' it easy
Easy, breezy, easy
Easy, breezy, easy
