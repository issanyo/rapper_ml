[Intro]
Yah, yah
Stop playing, I really don't like this beat, DK like this beat
So I'm on here full blooded you know what I'm talking bout
Loyal to the love, nigga

[Chorus]
Where you at blood? Let's go take it
One seven seven, watch me take it
Pull up on you with the shit I ain't waving
Draw a nigga wit a sack just to erase em
Let that chopper sing to em like Pandora
And I hope you got insurance on ya daughter
I be turned up in the city they want my lawyer
You know when everybody shine they want yo brothers

[Verse 1]
You bitches wanna fuck me, yes indeed
Water water, dancing hundred bands inside my jeans
Kill some water then ill never let em flash yo knees(Boss)
YSL slime balls crooked like the dean
Show me to lil daddy get a pound red loafers
If she suck it good we might dill just like kosher
Everybody giving shit away like we the Oprah
And you I'm bout that bread, DK run the toaster
100 bands inside of my ears
Let yo bitch run around me like she a deer
Got a red backpack full of presents
When I text her back she smile ear to ear
Even tho I killed a pussy nigga I hope he go to heaven
Yo old lady is hot, she hot, she hot like the fuckin' 911

[Chorus]
Where you at blood? Let's go take it
One seven seven, watch me take it
Pull up on you with the shit, I ain't waving
Charge nigga wit a sack just to erase em
Let that chopper sing to em like Pandora
And I hope you got insurance on ya daughter
I be turned up in the city, they want my lawyer
You know when everybody shine they want yo brothers

[Verse 2]
If I fall for her I spend bands on her wardrobe
Real big ol blood I won't 5 just like flakko
I don't give a fuck she can pull up in yo waldo
She goin' suck and fuck only thing I buy moscato
Get lil mama drunk she a fuck a elephant trunk
She going suck him why she beat you
I just call lil mama trunk
Got a bitch that look like new new
When she beat me we do oovoo
Snort that line on the table
I look crazy. I look cuckoo
You try to rob boy, it's not going happen
I know bitches that were roots and they not wit nappy
Smokin' fruit, Uncle Luke, what the fuck brackin'
Choppers ringing niggas be like what the fuck clapping (Me, bitch!)

[Chorus]
Where you at blood? Let's go take it
One seven seven, watch me take it
Pull up on you with the shit, I ain't waving
Charge nigga wit a sack just to erase em
Let that chopper sing to em like Pandora
And I hope you got insurance on ya daughter
I be turned up in the city, they want my lawyer
You know when everybody shine they want yo brothers
