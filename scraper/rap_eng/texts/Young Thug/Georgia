[Intro: Future]
Jeffery, Hendrxx
Ayy, bro, is that Jambo
Where we go from here?
Superfly
No regrets, I was made like this in Georgia

[Chorus: Future]
Don't let me die today
Don't let me perish away today
Don't let me die away
Don't let me perish away today
Georgia

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug & Future]
Everything I rock super fly
Killin' these hoes, Georgia, yeah, suicide (Georgia)
Umbrella on the Rolls Royce when I'm curbside

[Verse : Future]
Yeah, went to the end of the road, then I did a 360
Got a few of my hoes textin', sayin' they miss me (Georgia)
100, 300, let's go, we jumpin' out of it instantly (let's go)
Diamonds gon' light up and glow, she wanna come and ski with me (ooh)
I had her stand on her toes, the marble floor, no sympathy (Georgia)
I gave it to her right though I made her feel the chemistry (I made her feel the chemistry)
I should not stop smashing on these girls when they come to this lifestyle
We the ones drinkin' the most syrup, you can see all the jewelry is loud
Oh, Georgia, don't you give up on me
I can afford you, hope you'll be there for me
I piss out diamonds, I make it super fly
Ain't no regrets, my love will never die

[Bridge: Young Thug & Future]
SEX
Got no recess, we got no recess
No Tyco, with you
Live with no regrets, we havin' Rolex sex
And they both recessed, I know you best
Got no recess, we got no recess
No Tyco, with you (with you)
Live with no regrets, we havin' Rolex sex
And they both recessed, I know you best

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
No regrets, no regrets
Every day we go to sleep in Diamond
No recess, no recess
Every day we wake up, nigga, grindin'

[Chorus: Future]
Georgia, Georgia
Don't let me perish away today
Georgia, Georgia
Don't give up
Georgia, Georgia
