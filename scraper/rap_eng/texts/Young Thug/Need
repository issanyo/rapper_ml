[Intro: Gucci]
We turnt up, we turnt up

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
I used to smack this ho, her name was Skittles
Her ass was so fat, it used to jiggle
She took one too many skittles, now she limps
And I ain't fucking wit' her no mo' cause she UGH
Even back then my diamonds were so BRR
Fast forward, they still clear and I'm still here
Three O-Z's(ounces) of musty weed, muscatel
I cook the dope good, call me Chef Boy-ar-dee
Remember back then, they asked me "What you do?
Do you got a job? do you go to school?" (nope)
I know some kingpins, I know some robbers too (I know a few)
The kingpin will rob you man this shit a foo'
Red bottom shoes, give they ass the blues
Columbian co-Mexican connection
Got a Russian rifle, shoot you while ya' shittin'
Christian Louboutins on, they piranha skin
Guwop

[Hook - Gucci Mane]
My bitch said she 'bout to leave
She said that I don't cater to her needs
I got more cars than I need (I got cars)
I got more broads than I need (I got hoes too)
I'm in the trap screaming "NIGGA WHAT YOU NEED?"
Bought a Rolex that I don't really need
Big smoke with me, the whole pound of weed
Big drink with me, the whole pint of lean

[Verse 2 - Young Thug]
Ever since I signed with Gucci
I been back and forth to the hospital
I drink that Actavis, your Sprite look like it got Starburst or Skittles
Two iPhone 5, pussy nigga, stuff a pill with the killers
If you've me mad, I'ma come and babysit your little sisters
I got that Act- that Act- that Act- that pour it up then I sip
I cook that work on Christmas for you, I'm a Pillsbury deal
I mix my lean with my Sprite, that's a Pillsbury bill
I whip it (Cocaine)
I shift it (Cocaine)
I get it
Them digits
Let's get it
I got cutie foreign bitches gettin' it
They whip it
I shove my ass inside of them Bentley's
I ride it
I don't make lefts, I only turn right
I'm back in the Spyder like yikes, my neck full of Christ
We gon' boom, boom, boom
Ain't no spots or rooms
I drop them bands on that Doom
And I'm Boosie on Zoom
My nick name, "Cocaine Boom"
I'm cookin' them coons
I don't care none 'bout goin' to prison
My children got rooms

[Hook out]
My bitch said she 'bout to leave
She said that I don't cater to her needs
I got more cars than I need (I got cars)
I got more broads than I need (I got hoes too)
I'm in the trap screaming "NIGGA WHAT YOU NEED?"
Bought a Rolex that I don't really need
Big smoke with me, the whole pound of weed
Big drink with me, the whole pint of lean
