[Hook: Young Thug]
From Amsterdam to New Mexico
All my niggas stay flexing, yo
Niggas ain't got no money, yo
Niggas ain't been invested on
How my niggas go get it
They never change, they original
They stay down with Thugga
And most 'em bang red, no seminole
Dipset our lifestyle, lil nigga
I'm screaming yayo like Snootie Wild, lil nigga
I know all about these hoes
If you don't know, I won't let you know
I gotta go
We like Dipset Dipset,  yeah we the Bird Gang (I know, I know)
We the Clipset Clipset, yeah we YSL (I know, I know)
Got the clip clip like set, yeah we YSL (I know, I know)
Put a nigga on a t-shirt, yeah we YSL

[Verse 1: MPA Duke]
I know they hate to see a young nigga out here grinding
I know they hate me, talk about me but I'm grinding
The freshest in school, all the bad bitches want me
And we do not fuck with broke niggas, pockets on me
Matter of fact, everything on me everything on me
Young nigga but I keep, I keep it so G
Walking through the hood with my head high, my neck hang like Willie B
Take the trips and I travel the globe, everybody know me

[Verse 2: Yak Gotti]
Married to the music and the money
I can get a bitch when I can't get nothing
Stay down, hitting licks with my homie
You can see it in my eyes that I want it
Keep it real with yourself, lil homie
You ain't 'bout that life, you don't want it
Nigga, show me my opponent
Or tell me where you want it
This that Dripset, that Dripset nigga, yeah yeah yeah
Red bandana like Santana on my head, hell yeah
Infatuated with stunting, she say she want her a youngin'
I take her to Benihana and throw that broke bitch a bundle
