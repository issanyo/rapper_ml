[Pre-Chorus: Swae Lee]
(Ear Drummers)
Pretty baby, I won't lie
I can get it right, one try
Roll this up and let's skydive
I hope you not afraid of heights
(Mike Will Made-It)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
'Cause I'm just the truth
Rolling like a fool
What have I gotten myself into?
Hurry up and choose

[Refrain: Young Thug]
I'm in sky, I'm in chill
With this ice in my ears
I walk to a boat out of LIV
We shut down apartments with shields
I jump off a jet to a buildin'
I take care of everybody billings
I wish they can stop with the killin'
I bought you the ring, but I ain't kneelin'
Ain't tellin' my business to Wendy Williams
They take this shit out on these sittin' children
Somebody else die when you sittin' chillin'
In the prison eatin' bread and chili
You get killed when you bright livin'
You ready to cap peelin'
Hardbody if shit get real, ayy
I can crack a seal, ayy

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Yeah, take a bite out the Ritalin
All these VVS
Now she swallow me down like a pill, yeah, yeah
Foolery, water, high in the sky, that's a nosebleed
Hide the Rollies and Pateks, don't post these
Stack that chip tall as ladders and palm trees, yeah
Started off with a lil' ranch, now I got a lot of blue cheese
I just had a deal 20 mil', she know not to start with me
I let the window down partially
Park the Rolls Royce, had to dodge at least
Gotta put half on a car at least
Hollywood bitch, I'm a star at least
I keep the Jeep extra large, she promise me a Nicki m√©nage
Keep the Dodge Jeep out the garage
Keep the black Jeep out the garage
20 new jeans, Saint Laurent
My private jet don't get rust
Peanut butter and jelly the guts
I pour a 4 up of Tussin, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Swae Lee]
Pretty baby, I won't lie
I can get it right, one try
Roll this up and let's skydive
I hope you're not afraid of heights

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
'Cause I'm just the truth
Rolling like a fool
What have I gotten myself into?
Hurry up and choose

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Mafia, run it up, run a couple milli' from ya clientele
Yeah, Alka-seltzer plus, serve it to the J's on Conley
Yeah, I'll be glad when a nigga approach me wantin' problems
Run it up, nigga chop him up, put him in a grinder like a cow, yeah
Outside with the dealers, in the projects
I'm from where the dope fiends shoot the powder heads
I'm in Saks with a half a mil', get my sack on
Cha-cha, got extreme moves for a redbone, yeah
Pussy pink like a pig, beat it 'til it's red, oh
Halftime, spent six dimes on red, oh
Figure four, still givin' head, oh
Spend a 100 thou' on a diamond for the dead

[Refrain: Young Thug]
I'm in sky, I'm in chill
With this ice in my ears
I walk to a boat out of LIV
We shut down apartments with shields
I jump off a jet to a buildin'
I take care of everybody billings
I wish they can stop with the killin'
I bought you the ring, but I ain't kneelin'
Ain't tellin' my business to Wendy Williams
They take this shit out on these sittin' children
Somebody else die when you sittin' chillin'
In the prison eatin' bread and chili
You get killed when you bright livin'
You ready to cap peelin'
Hardbody if shit get real, ayy
I can crack a seal, ayy

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
'Cause I'm just the truth
Rolling like a fool
What have I got myself into?
Hurry up and choose

[Outro: Swae Lee]
She ain't over me, yeah
She ain't over, f-fuck fuck it
I ain't over her just yet, I ain't over
I'll be on my way for sunset
Cancel the party, baby, I'm a wreck
I'm a wreck
I'll be on my way
