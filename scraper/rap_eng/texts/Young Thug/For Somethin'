[Young Thug: Verse 1]
Take a nigga off
Wipe his nose clean
Young slime aka triple cross king
The check on my head my im worth some
Lord please, what im on this earth for
Im paranoid, I'm in the brand new porsche
With a brick of boy and a pound of molly
I put my hood on, now my hood solid
Hundred thousand cash and a FN
Support my vato, fishscale swim
Cocaina ,watch it come back like Makaveli
Pump back - killuminati
I never sell my soul for a buggatti
