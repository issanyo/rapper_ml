[Intro]
Thugger, Thugger
Wheezy produced it
We high, seducin'
Every hoe walkin' through the door
Wheezy beats
Fasho

[Chorus]
I laugh at bitches that done played me
Oh my God, baby, baby (yee, yee)
You laugh at nothing, boy you crazy (you)
Ain't no "I owe you," owe you nothin' (cost)
No lean on the kid, bitch, I paid ya
She gon' get geeked up when she lace it (sauce)
I don't rock it if I don't make it (swear)
No teeth, she bracin'
I was, in it-in it for the
Sake of my kids (yeah), I promise (swear)
We on, we never stoppin'
Hop on, come on, woahhh
Jump on, wet like a shark, oh my Lord (heee)

[Verse 1]
Like Marilyn Manson (yeah)
Diamonds singing, diamonds dancing (singin')
I live for this shit, it's a passion (I do)
My mode is 'Geeked up' call it dabbin' (shwoo)
I'm poppin' that bih like an Aspirin (poppin' that bih like)
I'm popping these perks like they Aspirins (poppin' 'em)
When you think I'm gay, think of caskets
Damn, I had to cry first 'cause I'm laughing (haa)
Put that dough on your purses (hee, hee)
Got it snowing on purpose (yeah, racks)
The big day was a Saturday (what, what?)
Throw that dough on a Thursday
Half a million in pesos (half)
We gon' throw up some birds (brr, brr)
Hunnid thou' for the necklace (hunnid thou')
Take the charm and it's worth it
212, well talk to me
Big Bs like a bumblebee
Two twenty five on the stingray (skeet)
If you know biology (yeah)
Cheese on my head, I'm Green Bay (cheese)
R.I.P Chalicee
I let her have fun, and I let her play
But she my main bitch biologically (Thugger)

[Chorus]
I laugh at bitches that done played me
Oh my God, baby, baby (yee, yee)
You laugh at nothing, boy you crazy (you)
Ain't no "I owe you," owe you nothin' (cost)
No lean on the kid, bitch, I paid ya
She gon' get geeked up when she lace it (sauce)
I don't rock it if I don't make it (swear)
No teeth, she bracin'
I was, in it-in it for the
Sake of my kids (yeah), I promise (swear)
We on, we never stoppin'
Hop on, come on, woahhh
Jump on, wet like a shark, oh my Lord (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Bitch it's hammer time (hammer)
All these hoes so fine (yee)
She gon' close her eyes (what?)
I don't want that, oh, I
Said that I must was high (dope)
I took a Vicodin like ten minutes ago
But prior... to that, I was higher than a flier
Hop on a private and catch up, where's all my sleep?
I don't want nut in your face, I want in them titties
You want my signature, them numbers must increase
Put so many hoes in the car, I can smell disease (brr, brr, brr, brr)
I'm a king like Diddy (brr)
Get fresh, I'm ROCin' like JAY-Z (brr, woah)
My shoes, so clean, I'm ballin', I'm ballin' like KD (oh)
No beanie, no weenies (oh, my Lord)
I told her like

[Chorus]
I laugh at bitches that done played me
Oh my God, baby, baby (yee, yee)
You laugh at nothing, boy you crazy (you)
Ain't no "I owe you," owe you nothin' (cost)
No lean on the kid, bitch, I paid ya
She gon' get geeked up when she lace it (sauce)
I don't rock it if I don't make it (swear)
No teeth, she bracin'
I was, in it-in it for the
Sake of my kids (yeah), I promise (swear)
We on, we never stoppin'
Hop on, come on, woahhh
Jump on, wet like a shark, oh my Lord
