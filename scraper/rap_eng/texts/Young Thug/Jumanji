I took my bitch on Safari
The top of my head is a monkey
Beach of the leopard my body

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Dressin' Hakuna Matada
Everything head to toe doesn't exist
I might go African Mondu my bitch
Coming to America my name is Hakeem
I go safari and lion my jeans
Pardon me bitch I'm leo the king
Breakin' my wrist whippin' up Billie Jean
Cali embargo
I'm goin' back to Cali, thats that D1 shit I got in my jeans
Double the ghost the ? machine
Uno Dos cup on my lean
Smokin' on gas like a hookah machine
High top Versace Versace me
I might just go tropical tacky happy
Pull up with a pink bitch laffy taffy
Flippin' the fuck out them bricks from papi
I get so hippy and spiffy in traffic that you just might just safari

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Ostrich seats wrapped around the Masi'
Jumanji Jumanji poison ivy
Skinny jeans with the African fitted
Loaded with bills, Thugger Cosby
Elephant quick thats gon' cover my back
She want a cat so I bought her a Jag
I dress like a sequence to how I do that
Ice water on water I'm [?] wet
Crocodile hunter the new stingray 'vette
I'm draped up in gold, Cheetah round my neck
Longway got me a new mink thats a bet
I put it right over my Justin Bieber vest
Left a [?] at the spot in Gwinnett
My closet just gon' end up killing me
Five hundred cash, literally
Monkey sheet cover my ceiling piece
Don't fall I frogged up my walls
Jumanji I panda my brawl
Eat these leaves off of my balls
Phantom might cause a tragic
I slugged my son now he's a bastard

[Verse 3: Lil Duke]
Jumanji Jumanji
Banana my clips for all of them monkeys
Pull up in that new Ferrari, on my passenger side is a duncan
I came up with the hyenas, my feet is Safaris
I'm covered in cheetah
I look my name is [?]
Guiseppe Zanotti the new bumblebees
Original pint ain't got none of these
Jumanji Safari got nominated
Why do you think yo bitch ass voted for me?
Seen that new flooded out Avianne
I'm in the [?] thats aviated
So many guns like the terminator
Gianni Medusa [?]
Shoppin' rinks gold I'm a 80's baby
Call me trapper of the year, they lovin' my gear
The diamonds are clear, I don't even have to steer
But when I walk in all the bitches they stare
Dodgin' all the traffic near
Takin' the shortcut hop in the lear
Run with the bales and hang with gorillas
I came up in the jungle I can not fear
