[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, keepin' it triller, I walk in the dealer
I'm 'bout to go ham with my young niggas (word)
You know the rule, if you see me in traffic
Don't dap me, you know I don't fuck with you (word)
Rollin' with Nicki and we in the 'Bach and she heated
'Cause I brought the drum with us (word)
You know I'm fresh out the slums, nigga (slums, nigga)
I know it never was love, nigga (woo)
I'm in the trenches, I'm hangin' with killers
An' robbers an' all of the drug dealers (hitters)
We in the section, we plottin' on takin' your chain
When you leave out the club, nigga (stick 'em)
Show no mercy like a 'lago ('lago)
Ain't no money, ain't no convo (convo)
Get your bitch some Louboutins, though
In the back, hit it with the combo (hey-ya)
Bust down, bust down (bust down)
Meek Milly back, like, what now? (what now?)
Bitches that fronted way back in the day
All on the kid like, "What up now?" (up now?)
I'm like, "What's up now?" (sup, bitch?)
You fuck with that lame an' you stuck now (stuck now)
Bulletproof all in the truck now (truck now)
Promethazine in my cup now (cup now)
When you be poppin', these niggas dick ridin'
An' pretty bitches wanna fuck now (woo)
I'm up now (up now), I guess it's love now (love now)
I guess it's all cool (all cool), dope in the dog food (dog food)
Lamborghini got her pussy wet, call it a carpool (whoa)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Brr, homicide, got a new Ferrari with the frog eyes on 'em
Brr, slim, thick bitch, big titties with some nice thighs on 'em (uh)
Brr, fuck with me, treat you like a street nigga, we gon' ride on 'em
Brr, I'm a megastar in a foreign car, baby, slip and slide on you
No, we not selfish (nope), this that real gold, you can melt this

I'm a shooter, I don't call niggas (what?)
On the D'Usse like Wall nigga (woo)
Cross her over, hit her with the woooh
In the Wraith, stars in the roof
Light her up like Pikachu
In the Ghost, playing peek-a-boo
Wait, wait, wait, niggas can't figure me out, hey
I got this stick in the house, hey

Sit on that shit in a drought, hey
Sell it for triple the amount, hey
Stack it up, bag it up, add it up, ready for shippin', we sendin' it out
