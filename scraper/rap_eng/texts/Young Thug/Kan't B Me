[Intro: Young Thug]
Thugger
Aye man real deal B-roll udigg what I'm saying

[Hook: Young Thug]
ABC, I'm about to come
Take a nigga trap, then I move like gum
50 racks spent on the futon
D-Boy lifestyle who want some, who want some
Ride with them Birds like Julio Jones
Take a nigga bitch, who the fuck wanna try me
Who the fuck wanna try me
Who the fuck wanna try me
Telling me they can't be me
They can't see me, oh
I'm balling, they can't D me

So sick, I'm broke, I filled my prescription
Right to the bank, now my pockets look terrific

[Hook: Young Thug]
ABC, I'm about to come
Take a nigga trap, then I move like gum
50 racks spent on the futon
D-Boy lifestyle who want some, who want some
Ride with them Birds like Julio Jones
Take a nigga bitch, who the fuck wanna try me
Who the fuck wanna try me
Who the fuck wanna try me
Telling me they can't be me
They can't see me, oh
I'm balling, they can't D me

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I got black ice on my wrist nigga
I got 100k on my bitch, she whiter than Hilfiger
No I don't play no games with 'em, no-no games with 'em
If he ain't red I don't bang with em'
Paint his shirt stain with 'em
Cause all my niggas been ready
Diamonds in the Rollie going brazy like a spec
You can have her fucker, I need money instead
I need three bitches on me like Ed, Ed and Ed
Baby bring me that twat, real stoners do pot
You going take something like What!?
Real cheese like DiGior...no
I promise she told
I do something that bitch gon' jump like a toad
Them diamonds cold like the fuckin' North Pole

[Hook: Young Thug]
ABC, I'm about to come
Take a nigga trap, then I move like gum
50 racks spent on the futon
D-Boy lifestyle who want some, who want some
Ride with them Birds like Julio Jones
Take a nigga bitch, who the fuck wanna try me
Who the fuck wanna try me
Who the fuck wanna try me
Telling me they can't be me
They can't see me, oh
I'm balling, they can't D me
