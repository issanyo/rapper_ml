[Chorus: Bricc Baby]
Nah, he don't want no smoke nigga
He don't want no smoke
I got that pistol to his throat nigga
Bang, I cock back and let it blow nigga
He don't want no smoke
He don't want no smoke nigga
I got that pistol to his throat nigga
Bang, I cock back and let it blow nigga

[Verse 1: Bricc Baby]
I pull up and hop out the hitter
No questions my nigga, just air it out
Don't give a fuck if the feds out
This is the choppers with red dots
I step on the blood, I got red bottoms
Not leaving no witness, kill all your partners
All of my niggas, yeah they piranhas
Who wanna rock with the don dada
I pull up with my locs nigga
[?] and one own nigga
They let them bullets fly straight through your dome nigga
Bricc City, we the new Death Row nigga

[Chorus: Bricc Baby & Young Thug]
Nah, he don't want no smoke nigga (woah)
He don't want no smoke (no)
I got that pistol to his throat nigga (bankroll)
Bang, I cock back and let it blow nigga (gon' blow)
He don't want no smoke (pussy boy don't want no smoke)
He don't want no smoke nigga (boy don't make it blow)
I got that pistol to his throat nigga (we gon' let it blow)
Bang, I cock back and let it blow nigga

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Holy moly, fuck it back, let it blow

[Chorus: Bricc Baby & Young Thug]
Nah, he don't want no smoke nigga (woah)
He don't want no smoke (no)

Bang, I cock back and let it blow nigga (gon' blow)
He don't want no smoke (pussy boy don't want no smoke)
He don't want no smoke nigga (boy don't make it blow)
I got that pistol to his throat nigga (we gon' let it blow)
Bang, I cock back and let it blow nigga
