[Chorus]
All of these young niggas killin' each other, they tryna just gain clout
How you gon' lie, just say that I said that, the fuck is you talkin' about?
I had the dick inside of her mouth and I still had the chopper out
I put the bitch inside of a Range, the way she suckin' my cock
I take a hundred racks right out of the bank and put it on your tabletop
I got the croc Chanel bag, I'm 'bout to go fuck up the block
Hop in the Porsche then hopped out the Jag' and jack it like Jack in the Box
I put Chanel, the lil' bitty bags on over all of the thots

[Verse 1]
Maybach came with the torch and the hatchback
RayVac, spray his ass back nigga, blat, blat
My bitches got credentials and green eyes like a black cat
Your bitch is almost fat, better stop playin' 'fore you get whacked
Money got me shittin' like a laxative, no comparin', I ran up the racks
All of my bitches are boujee and bad, my money was long as his 'lac
I told the bitch that wasn't my kid, I need a paternity
Pull up to your block and takin' your cookie, call me Bernie

[Interlude]
Got the red interior, red shoes and red Jeep
Got a bad bitch, don't play the radio, Greg Street

[Verse 2]
Dead meat, know you're just a dead breed (ha)
Red meat, eat it like a deadbeat (deadbeat)
I pop a wheelie, I fuck on a bitch like I'm Banshee (brrt)
Bought a Rolls Royce and then I was smokin' on whammy (hrr)
I put the bitch on her back and I beat it like Hercules (hah)
How the fuck you let these rat niggas go get them some cheese? (Hah)
I had to send the car comin', I took off and ran with the keys (ha)
I put some diamonds on her toe, yeah they dancin', Chris Breezy
I go to Finland and I got a tall breezy comin' from Greece
I don't believe her, I think she Belize or she from Middle East

[Chorus]
All of these young niggas killin' each other, they tryna just gain clout
How you gon' lie, just say that I said that, the fuck is you talkin' about?
I had the dick inside of her mouth and I still had the chopper out
I put the bitch inside of a Range, the way she suckin' my cock
I take a hundred racks right out of the bank and put it on your table top
I got the croc' Chanel bag, I'm 'bout to go fuck up the block
Hop in the Porsche then hopped out the Jag' and jack it like Jack in the Box
I put Chanel, the lil' bitty bags on over all of the thots
