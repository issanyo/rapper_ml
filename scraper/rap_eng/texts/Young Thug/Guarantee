[Intro]
Oh, no need to kuff it or buff it
When you fuck sisters and cousins at like the same damn time
No, I won't fuck if she ugly
To me that shit is disgusting, no, no, no, they ain't my kind
No, no, no, they ain't my kind
Pass the basketball I'm a player
Yeah, I love all of y'all like the mayor
Hell, girl I want you all to myself

[Verse]
If you got AIDS, I want it
If you got herpes, I want it
That girl got game, I want it
That cat leave stains, I want it
I want it, new Glock .45's I want it
She screws like pliers, I want it
That  mmh-mmh-ah, I want it
Hey, she, she shake
She, she got 'em boolin' over coolin' today
She say she gon suck it and she gon' do it today
She, she up all night and she just want the D
I pick her up and drop her right back off
Hey, I'll bangin' red like hot sauce
No Olympian I got O's though
And I might feature the bitch with Trey Songz

[Hook]
Nobody, she don't want nobody, and I guarantee
She don't want nobody, she don't want nobody and I guarantee
She don't want nobody, she don't want nobody and I guarantee
She don't want nobody, not even me, and I guarantee
And I guarantee, not even me, and I guarantee
I said, not even me, and I guarantee

[Outro]
And I guarantee
I done leave and I come right back home to you
I go get the paper and bring it straight home to you
