[We got London On Da Track]

[Hook]
Got stacks and racks it's perfect timing
Damn right
Got off my ass and climbed that mountain, day and night
When I get racks I stack my pile up real high
Drainin' out my dick just like a termite
(ay) thermite , (ay ay) like a termite
She slimin' on my dick like she a termite
Like that term out , I call her turror mouth
I could drain all of these bitches like a termi-i-ite

[Verse 1]
Burberry on my bitch
Too feral they wishin'
I need diamonds I'm drippin'
Pillsbury on my bitch
Soft booty mofo's in the kitchen
Can't stop me I'm too deep in with the pimpin'
Bro why do my life turn cold?
And what if your brains were froze?
I know you are listening
And if I catch that rap then she fixina' bleed
And see you when you in the street
I count it , fat like a geek
She know my bankroll on fleek
She want eat me before she eat
I cannot stop and don't stop
And she sucking me loose I can't breathe
She scratching up her knees
I'm like this can't be

[Hook] x2
Got stacks and racks it's perfect timing
Damn right
Got off my ass and climbed that mountain, day and night
When I get racks I stack my pile up real high
Drainin' out my dick just like a Termite
(ay) thermite , (ay ay) like a termite
She slimin' on my dick like she a termite
Like that term out , I call her turror mouth
I could drain all of these bitches like a termi-i-ite
