[Hook: Trouble]
All the stress it led me to the bogus
Take the pack, I do that for my brodies
Wasn’t ballin’, no we wasn’t Kobe
You don’t know my struggle, you don’t know me
You don’t know my struggle, you don’t know me nigga
Much respect to the OGs before me
All the OGs before me they know me
I don’t fuck with these niggas, they bogus

[Verse 1: Trouble]
Homie on go, he retarded
Lil mama life of the party
Said you know'd him 'fore you,  hardly
Shut the fuck up, roll the Marley
No sir I’m not with the arguin'
I bring the flames, now the arson
I see you with all the talkin’ now
I shut doggies up with the barking now
OGs with me, I run markets now
Man the OGs with me I run markets now
Been told a bitch she can get money
Join on the team and the ho wanna bargain now
East side, Big Bank
South side, Kentay
West side, shawty shawty
North side, hey

[Hook: Trouble]
All the stress it led me to the bogus
Take the pack, I do that for my brodies
Wasn’t ballin’, no we wasn’t Kobe
You don’t know my struggle, you don’t know me
You don’t know my struggle, you don’t know me nigga
Much respect to the OGs before me
All the OGs before me they know me
I don’t fuck with these niggas, they bogus

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I was getting money before you knowed me
I been getting money and I showed it
I’ma go'n cop it like the police
And I been shining, fuck a Rollie
When I rent it I’m moving out of town
I done came a long way from the battleground
I got ties with the mob so don’t play around
Or we do just like rain, wet ‘em down
Take the Percocet, take the Vicodin
I’ma pour up mud, never lighting it
Got 100 bags in my pocket shit
If I ever cock it bitch I’m popping it
And the bitch chose me ‘cause the wrist frozen
You can act slow but the bitch know me
I might let her dress me like a fruitopia
The OG niggas feel me and they know me
Once upon a time in a gang called blood
I was running with them OGs ‘cause them niggas showed me love
All the OGs fucking with me ‘cause they like the way I thug
First I made a milly, then I turned they driveways up

[Hook: Trouble]
All the stress it led me to the bogus
Take the pack, I do that for my brodies
Wasn’t ballin’, no we wasn’t Kobe
You don’t know my struggle, you don’t know me
You don’t know my struggle, you don’t know me nigga
Much respect to the OGs before me
All the OGs before me they know me
I don’t fuck with these niggas, they bogus

[Outro: Young Thug]
I don't fuck wit' 'em, they bogey, they bogus
Get the fuck away, free Renny and Boguts
Get the fuck away from me lil bitch, is you bogus?
Yeah, pussy nigga get away, watch your [?]
