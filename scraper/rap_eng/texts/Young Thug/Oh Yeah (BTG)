[Intro]
I was riding on a bike
On a very late night
She give me chills, I'm for real, hey!
I'm the one with soul, and I know your role
A real one for sure (for sure)
I won't fill your coke, I won't fill lipo
I won't no, no, no

[Chorus]
Oh yeah yeah, no, no
Oh yeah yeah, oh
Oh yeah yeah, oh
Look at that stare right there, that stare right there
That stare right there yeah, yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
If I stunt on them niggas you don't
I'll walk that street (walk that street)
Next to my bike (yeah)
Child on the front
Child on the bike like we livin' overseas
I had a dream these niggas stood over me (and what?)
I had a bad bitch and she ate it off a cake (bitch you geeked)
Drunk off your love and I just stood by the sink (blehh)
Look in these eyes, they disguise you to me (what?)
I just popped like rubber bands on it
Her booty fly like LA, I just land on it
Yeah, top notch saran on it
Yeah, baby tell me where we stand
Her booty big as a sedan, I'm like

[Chorus]
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Look at that stare right there, that stare right there
That stand stare there yeah, yeah (look at it)
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Now I be cruisin' to Lil Uzi
Talking shit so pass the toothpaste
Leave that to 'dem, ain't nothin' to do with it
I want head like a dinner date, yeah
I remember you popped your first bottle (I remember)
I remember I had my first toddler (what?)
Nothin' changed, I remember I had my third toddler (and what?)
Yeah lil Wanda, she was my syrup partner (lean)
Free lil Unfunk he got an 'erc doctor
I ranned off on some of my cursed doctors
Dropped the racks right on 'em like a girl got 'em
I'm just in it, bae this your world, yeah yeah
And if you like 'em, then I love 'em, they deserve partners
You left a bag for me to seeâ€“e
You left a bag and now you hurt me
I only helped you pack your bag because you irk me
Do it hurt when you gone? I'm like

[Chorus]
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Look at that stare right there, that stare right there
That stare right there yeah, yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 3]
Fuck 'em all and fuck what they thinkin'
First it wet then it multiply yeah
You still piped, you ain't take it down yeah
Mekhi Phifer, it's goin' down, yeah yeah
Bae you know that it's goin' down
I'm they ticket, they hold me down
And I'm so in love with the town
Much respect when you come around
I was riding on a bike
On a very late night
She give me chills, I'm for real
