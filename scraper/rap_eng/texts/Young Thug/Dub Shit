You doing that dub shit (thought you were my bro)
You doing that dub shit (drippin' on hoes)
You doing that dub shit (drippin' on niggas)
You doing that dub shit (droppin' your clothes)
You doing that dub shit (fuckin' that body)
You doing that dub shit (you fuckin' her raw)
You doing that dub shit (you fuckin' she cocky)
Stop doing that dub shit (same color hot sauce)
You dub, you dub (you dub, you dub)

[Verse 1]
You be doing that lame shit, you be caking up all these hoes, nigga
That that loose all your stain shit
Nigga taste on a [?], drop his ass of a Bankhead
I'ma pop me a percocet nigga, I'ma pop me a painkiller
I'm a muhfucking walking store, I pull up at Stop N’ Go’s
I'ma pour up that Act until its empty and my pockets on overload
Let them know that we is not sweet, nigga, rather than overtoe
All my bottles came from the bar
But all my ice came up out the ocean
Yeah, my diamonds came out the sea
They no African diamonds baby
Nigga play  hide-and-go-seek
Then I'ma change the climax, baby
I'ma hit from the back, baby
I'ma smoke on some stacks, baby
I just fuck on her neck, baby
R.I.P Troup from Old Nat, baby

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You should stack up some cash
You should smoke out the bag
You should just cop the new ghost
You should cop it for your dad
I done forgot 'bout the jag
I was just doing my bars in L.A, man I should just walk with the flag
And I wanna want nothing but platinum
You doing idiotic shit
My mom put the titles on the list
I just spend 50 sound bricks
Man that's some pittiotic shit
And I won't even think that's a word
But you cannot drip it like this
I'm rocking water like a ship
Dippin your bitch like a chip
All of this cash got me going
Goddamn, I think I'm Al Capone
Their jewelry so fake they tryna clone
Tell me if you a needle long
Don't try stopping me alone
If she get lonely, leave her home
I call up my war, I need a zone
All of my dawgs need 'em on

[Chorus]
You doing that dub shit (thought you were my bro)

You doing that dub shit (fuckin' that body)
You doing that dub shit (you fuckin' her raw)
You doing that dub shit (you fuckin' she cocky)
Stop doing that dub shit (same color hot sauce)
You dub, you dub (you dub, you dub)
You doing that dub shit (that big ol' dub)
You so dub-dub (a fuckin' dub)
You be doing that dub shit (that big ol' dub)
You be doing that dub shit (a fuckin' dub)
You be doing that dub shit (a fuckin' dub)
You be doing that dub shit (a fuckin' dub)
You be doing that dub shit (a fuckin' dub)
You doing that-
