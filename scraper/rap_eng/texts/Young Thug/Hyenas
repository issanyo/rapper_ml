[Intro: Young Thug]
Turn up with Lil Yachty
Thugger, Thugger, baby
Trouble Man, aka T.I.P., yeah
Bankroll Mafia, YSL, Lil Duke, slat
R.I.P. to Troupe

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
You better run, we gon' come for you
My IV is red like thermometers
I fuck on that bitch like a porn star
Hit me up when I'm on tour
I'ma unlock the card if you want it
We gon' fuck on that day that you bought it
These lil' niggas not eatin', they boney
Her best friend got her goin' and goin'

[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm in a foreign car, she in another car
I pull up to the job, I walk in her job
And cum in her jaw like shotta
Se pasa en mi casa
Ain't lookin' over, I'm leanin' over
Your bitch want it, she fienin', homie
I got stripes like a zebra, homie
I'm laughin' like a hyena, homie

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I don't know where you get your facts at, nigga
But you come in half-assed, I'ma max that nigga
Catch his ass in my hood, I'ma tax that nigga
If he run, give you ten if you catch that nigga
You know you don't really want my crew to attack, nigga
I'll fire ya ass up, you can ask that nigga
Nah, I bet you'd rather at that nigga
Beefin' all on Instagram and Snapchat with him
Just yesterday I was a young crack dealer
When the trap was slow I put it on the fast track, nigga
Aimed for eight figures, shot past that, nigga
Set the world on fire, where your match at, nigga?
A.K.O.O. and Hustle Gang did thirty somethin' million
Another seven off of television, put that with it
Now can you match that, nigga?
And we ain't even talkin' 'bout my rap track, nigga
I'm paid, fresh out the bank
I make that lil' money look less than you think
Yeah you think you got more, ain't as much as you think
When you see that I am everything that you ain't
Like a stand-up guy and a real nigga
Sucka ass nigga, don't deal with him
I had a bunch of solid niggas standin' with me in the trap
Eighteen years later and I'm still with 'em

[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm in a foreign car, she in another car
I pull up to the job, I walk in her job
And cum in her jaw like shotta
Se pasa en mi casa
Ain't lookin' over, I'm leanin' over
Your bitch want it, she fienin', homie
I got stripes like a zebra, homie
I'm laughin' like a hyena, homie

[Verse 3: MPA Duke]
I love all my niggas, I ride for my homies
They keep it one hunnid, can't lie to my homies
Eatin' no turkey now, no b-bologna
Still gainin' weight and we 'bout to go tourin'
We really rich niggas, we hop in the foreign
Nigga you play and get shot by the mornin'
Blat-blat-blat-blat-blat-blat-blat
Spray a whole hundred shots with no warnin'
Bales and them scales, before rap I was rich
Still hit them blocks, all up in the dead end
This a cold world, I've lost so many friends
So many fakes, I don't want no more friends
Stack all this money and count all the yams
Used to move weight and ain't talkin' 'bout no gym
Rubber band racks by the ten now
Used to be broke, went from bucket to Benz

[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm in a foreign car, she in another car
I pull up to the job, I walk in her job
And cum in her jaw like shotta
Se pasa en mi casa
Ain't lookin' over, I'm leanin' over
Your bitch want it, she fienin', homie
I got stripes like a zebra, homie
I'm laughin' like a hyena, homie

[Verse 4: Lil Yachty]
Spent the weight on my chain
Don't you dare speak on my name
I'm the same nigga, ain't shit changed
Never gave a fuck what a pussy nigga think
No we are not the same, stay in your lane
These niggas leasin' their rings, it ain't what you think
This niggas actin' like they're so hard
Make a pussy nigga park my car
All these pussy niggas try to sound like me
Shit, they won't get too far
Lil' Boat

[Verse 5: Shad da God]
Ooh, mil', hundo
Yellow, purp, red drank though
Pull up on the set with a bitch so bad
Every nigga want her back though
My name known in the hood
Like a mothafuckin' stop on a back door
I don't even need no Bankroll
You could get wet for the zero
Aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Bankroll my Mafia
I put on that gold like Gaddafi, yeah
I ride 'round, I'm juugin' at 9 a.m., god!
Bankroll my Mafia
Bankroll my Mafia

[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm in a foreign car, she in another car
I pull up to the job, I walk in her job
And cum in her jaw like shotta
Se pasa en mi casa
Ain't lookin' over, I'm leanin' over
Your bitch want it, she fienin', homie
I got stripes like a zebra, homie
I'm laughin' like a hyena, homie
