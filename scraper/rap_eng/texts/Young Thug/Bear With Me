Mike WiLL Made-It

[Chorus]
Now I bet if I ever die she gon' cry
And I know even if she get high she gon' lie
I know it, that my brudda he gon' lie and he down for it
Bitch, I pop molly and buy Tom Ford
I want you baby, baby, baby
Get rich and make my bruddas my neighbors, neighbors
I’m rocking red, white and blue like a patriot, patriot
My momma ain't 'bout to answer if it ain't got acres, acres

[Verse]
Okay, all my diamonds water like a pool party
Bitch, I’m young Thugga like a newborn 2Pac
Just bring that ass back, get comfortable like a futon
Meanwhile I’m working my moves, young Thugga Liu Kang
I buy you the shit if you suck dick just like a tic
I got hoes from the east, north, west, south, so legit
If a pussy nigga play, I shoot his back just like he Rick
No smiling, my gators got poison ivy
She riding me like a Harley, I’m riding her like a trolley
Meet me at the Dubba, you know Wale
And broke never been the topic
Put that bitch on her feet with Huaraches

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Now I bet if I ever die she gon' cry
And I know even if she get high she gon' lie
I know it, that my brudda he gon' lie and he down for it
Bitch, I pop molly and buy Tom Ford
I want you baby, baby, baby
Get rich and make my bruddas my neighbors, neighbors
I’m rocking red white and blue like a patriot
My momma ain't 'bout to answer if it ain't got acres

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Now I bet if I ever die she gon' cry
And I know even if she get high she gon' lie
I know it, that my brudda he gon' lie and he down for it
Bitch, I pop molly and buy Tom Ford
I want you baby, baby, baby
Get rich and make my bruddas my neighbors, neighbors
I’m rocking red, white and blue like a patriot, patriot
My momma ain't 'bout to answer if it ain't got acres, acres

[Outro]
Yeah
