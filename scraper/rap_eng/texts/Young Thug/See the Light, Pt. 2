[Intro: Young Thug & Ralo]
Blue hundreds on me, ooh
Yeah, Fam...Goon!
YSL and Famgoon, hey
Every night, yeah
Yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I done picked my battles, man I went through every fight
Grandpa got cancer, I thought he was dying every night
Disrespect that street code, you can die twice
Racing to the top, climb that ladder with my ice
Every time I seen that light, ooh
(Every time I seen that light, ayy)
Every time I seen that light, ooh
(I said every time I seen that, hey, best believe)
Every night I climb that light, every time I seen that light
Climbing to the top of that light, tryna get to the top of that light
Every time I seen that light, ooh
(I can't get no sleep at night)

[Verse 1: Ralo]
Every time you see me, you gon' think you seen a million dollars
Every nigga ever tried to shit, I swear I seen the matter
Everything I do is for the team, and everybody seen
Don't ask me 'bout ho shit, that shit there is not a lead
You know what I mean when I told you you mean the world to me
You know I stay clean 'cause every time you know they notice me
Pockets full of green, we gon' fuck up every night, yeah
I didn't have a thing, now I got my bread right, yeah
Just because I got money, that shit don't wash away my problems
I'll only be honest when I don't talk about my partners
And they'll never say my name if they ain't sayin' good about him
I gave back to the hood and now the whole hood got him

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I done picked my battles, man I went through every fight
Grandpa got cancer, I thought he was dying every night
Disrespect that street code, you can die twice
Racing to the top, climb that ladder with my ice
Every time I seen that light, ooh
(Every time I seen that light, ayy)
Every time I seen that light, ooh
(I said every time I seen that, hey, best believe)
Every night I climb that light, every time I seen that light
Climbing to the top of that light, tryna get to the top of that light
Every time I seen that light, ooh
(I can't get no sleep at night)

[Verse 2: Ralo]
I made it to places they said I couldn't go
They hated before, I know they hate me more
I made my enemy my brother 'cause he ain't nothing like them suckers
If they ain't with us then it's fuck 'em
And tell them ducks we'll pluck 'em
I never went against the grain, I do this shit for the game
They do this shit for the fame, I gave this shit everything
I never ask for them problems, we go to war with the mobsters
I don't fuck with them crabs, I'm allergic to lobsters
If you leave I won't miss you, I don't have nothing against you
Don't you take this offensive, wasting time expensive
I don't walk in the club unless they cut me a check
I don't walk out the ring until they show me respect, I won

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I done picked my battles, man I went through every fight
Grandpa got cancer, I thought he was dying every night
Disrespect that street code, you can die twice
Racing to the top, climb that ladder with my ice
Every time I seen that light, ooh
(Every time I seen that light, ayy)
Every time I seen that light, ooh
(I said every time I seen that, hey, best believe)
Every night I climb that light, every time I seen that light
Climbing to the top of that light, tryna get to the top of that light
Every time I seen that light, ooh
(I can't get no sleep at night)

[Outro: Young Thug]
Riding with the Famgoon
I heard she went to Cancun
Fuckin with the Famgoon
End up in the Rikers room, umm
Playing with the slimeball
You tryna have a slime behind the wall
I see you trying with the slimeball
I know you want see us behind the wall, yeah
