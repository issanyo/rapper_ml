[Hook]
I guess I got your respect
Cuz the Indian got your back gyal, yeah
I want you to drop it, low pick it up and bring it back, gyal
And I know you see me in this club with these bands on me
Stayed for four songs till she ran down me
Powder of what else [?] on me

[Verse 1]
I got rose gold chains 'round my neck cuz I'm a black dude
She didn't wanna fuck me, she wanna fuck my tattoos
I'm a tat dude, I was splat dude
My blunts the largest, smokin' Pee Wee's garden
In the club wit 50 hoes, ain’t none one of them arguin'
Weed give me the munchies, might just eat them all, I’m starvin
Give 'em Biggie, still ballin'
Shouts out to GM, free UnkFunk, G and Marley
Ooh, and I'll miss you baby
You know I-I love you babe
She runnin' circles 'round a nigga like the equator
I gotta date, I wouldn't rape her, I gotta skate her

[Hook]
I guess I got your respect
Cuz the Indian got your back gyal, yeah
I want you to drop it, low pick it up and bring it back, gyal
And I know you see me in this club with these bands on me
Stayed for four songs till she ran down me
Powder of what else [?] on me

[Verse 2]
I got hoes breathin' all over my dick like it's a heart
I got tons of that weight livin' in my house like Barbra Spark
Got a tall light skin ho that like to get touched, she a work of art
Got a bitch number in my phone
Don't call her phone unless I need her car, ooh
You flyin' wit me, or you gon' stay with them
Baby, use your head, you can't lay with them
Not a kid, baby play with 'em
That nigga, that boy say one assist that's a pair of Timbs
And I'll miss you baby, I love you baby
I was leanin' when I mugged you, babe
And you know I was horny when I rubbed you, babe

[Hook]
I guess I got your respect
Cuz the Indian got your back gyal, yeah
I want you to drop it, low pick it up and bring it back, gyal
And I know you see me in this club with these bands on me
Stayed for four songs till she ran down me
Powder of what else [?] on me
