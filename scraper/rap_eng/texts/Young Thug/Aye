[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
Thugger Thugger, my brother, brother
These niggas in trouble, trouble

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
You green as a soldier, I cashed out, it ain't stolen
Heyyy, got that gold Rollie poly
On my wrist, I can tote it, with my wrist I can roll it
Heyyy, that pistol stay fully loaded
I take your necklace, then sport it, I got your bitch, she all on it
Heyyy
Ooh, ooh, oohooh, Heyy
Ooh, ooh, oohooh, Heyyyeah

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
I walked in with a 40
I talk nothin' but money, YSL the rich homies
I put that old school on buttons
Don't come if you ain't fuckin', fuck nigga, no I can't trust him
Lil Scrappy, yo head, I bust it
I was trappin', I couldn't get busted
Had packages on them buses
I'm rappin', I came from nothin'
I got 'em like, "What, what? Aye"
Money on your head, nigga so don't play
With who? With me, I stay with a Glock, 40 G, every day
Thugger still ridin' with the chop
Red on the beam, won't stop me from shooting you

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
You green as a soldier, I cashed out, it ain't stolen
Heyyy, got that gold Rollie poly
On my wrist, I can tote it, with my wrist I can roll it
Heyyy, that pistol stay fully loaded
I take your necklace, then sport it, I got your bitch, she all on it
Heyyy
Ooh, ooh, oohooh, Heyy
Ooh, ooh, oohooh, Heyyyeah

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I add mud with the soda, I drink lean, never sober
We lean like Morgan Freeman, Quan leanin' on my shoulder
Ooh you niggas still green like a soldier
I need me two like I'm poking
Out  at the concert, show 'em you clap it like Magnolia
Ooh you need to show 'em you're the best at what you do
I just took off, I'm on a mountain, girl no dew
Ooh, said she wanna party
Young Quan voice, I leave these bitches with no choice
I donâ€™t eat pork, I drink SmartWater like a dork
I'm not blowin' my money, lil' nigga, I'm not Scott Storch
Bought a bitch a Birkin bag, inside it was a Yorkie
You lil' nigga can't afford it

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
You green as a soldier, I cashed out, it ain't stolen
Heyyy, got that gold Rollie poly
On my wrist, I can tote it, with my wrist I can roll it
Heyyy, that pistol stay fully loaded
I take your necklace, then sport it, I got your bitch, she all on it
Heyyy
Ooh, ooh, oohooh, Heyy
Ooh, ooh, oohooh, Heyyyeah
