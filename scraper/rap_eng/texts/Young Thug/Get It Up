[Hook: Duke]
I know its been a long time
Had to stay down on my grind and get it up
I remember days I didn't have a dime
When I had to go and stick a nigga up (had to go and stick it up)
Back then I was broke didn’t really have luck
Running in circles thought I was stuck
Back against the wall I'm like who can I trust
Everybody say they broke well who the fuck up
Stay down on yo grind til you get it up
Stack all of that paper go get it up
I’mma be rich, You could hate it or love it
Well it done paid off all that pain and that sufferin’

[Young Thug]
I love you bae you can give it up
All thats detained you should give em up
My coupe got no brain like I give it up
That boy don’t got stain he should give it up

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Damn I'm Up, I put me six tires on a  Tonka Trunk
I put some cameras on my mommas truck (swear)
I put everything that come on the truck
Only thing I didn’t put was some miles on her
Get the picture you pussy nigga, you say you want her I’ll dismiss her
Got nothing but bands in my trousers nigga
I’mma dress her out like she thousand nigga
Bout that time for her new passport
That lemon lime is what you ask for
I made a mill and went to class for it
I see the deal but what you ask for it?
Had to tell Flocka fuckin’ fast forward
Had to tell the J a fuckin’ backdoor

[Hook: Duke]
I know its been a long time
Had to stay down on my grind and get it up

Running in circles thought I was stuck
Back against the wall i’m like who can I trust

All thats detained you should give em up
My coupe got no brain like I give it up
That boy don’t got stain he should give it up

[Verse 2: Duke]
I had to stay down and get it, I’m tryna count millions
Money over bitches thats my religion
I done got close to god but I’m still sinning’
But I’m repenting’ ask God for forgiveness
Then I got up off my ass and went got it
Bitch do not ask cause you know that we got it
She shaking her ass and you know she at Follies
All in the lobby yeah that lil bitch she a Thotty
You better stack it and stash it, FN on me and its plastic
Run up lil nigga and shit gone get tragic
Rest In Peace Troupe until they drop my casket
We juug them pussy niggas just like Madden
Booted up off molly we high as Aladdin
If I don’t got next then I’m next to the man
Its been a long time do you dig what I’m sayin’
