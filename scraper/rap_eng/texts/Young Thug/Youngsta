[Intro: Blac Youngsta & Young Thug]
Ay, ay, ay Thug what poppin' nigga?

You feel me, we forever gon' get this money nigga
Always fuckin' wit his gun up nigga
Young nigga, I knock ya muthafuckin' hairline back wit yo bitch!
Big dinosaurs and the K

Fuck around and catch a nigga layin'
Fuck around and catch a nigga sprayin'
Fuck around and endorse the xans
Fuck around and grow my own strain

[Verse 1: Blac youngsta]
I'll forever get money with all of my niggas
Young rich nigga came from the bottom lil nigga
I remember days where I was starvin' lil nigga
I remember days I ain't have no water lil nigga
Thugger, Thugger, Youngsta nigga
Big body 'round me thumpin' nigga
Big 45 with too much pride, nigga ain't been no company nigga
Pink dinosaur in the cut
If you rippin' goin' through the lens
Fuck with me, you know you gonna get it
I go by the 4 lil nigga
My dick it gettin' hard for the money
Can't fuck that lil bitch, she ain't honest
Me my Thugger, got so much money we might just go out for my culture
I'm forever gon' be youngsta
Livin' young and reckless, I'm a dummy
I'm forever gon' shit on my haters
Stickin' dick in that lil bitch's stomach
As they put a warrant out for me
Nigga Iâ€™m forever running
YSL and CMG, we'll forever get this money

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I done went on home and fucked that nigga's broad
I done went and put some stars on my car
I'mma go and put some tents on the drop
I might beat 'em wit the lock in a sock
We gon' murder, no aggravated assault
Popcorn pussy nigga get popped
I got my license and DMV'd up
More money if you niggas teamed up
Percocet, the itchy, scatchy one
Factories off and put some dabbins up
Hungry niggas sell up on it, on it
I just want my brother out the bunk
Pockets fat like motherfuckin' clumps
Pockets like a motherfuckin' hump
Wallet like a motherfuckin' bump
Gators got the motherfuckin' mumps
Ooh yeah, 10 speed
These niggas want a soundbite, they dig me
These niggas ain't never been around, you can't see
Got 3 iPhones, I work 'em now, I manage me, ayy

[Hook: Young Thug]
