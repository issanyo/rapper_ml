[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
We 'bout to pull up
Who you pulling up with Rich Homie? Young Thugger
I'm talkin' 'bout that's my mo'fuckin' brother
Let's go, let's go!

[Hook: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
Magic City, Follies, Bitches wildin', make me pull up (pull up, pull up)
Molly cleaner than a stylist, plus I pulled up
If a nigga come around talkin' 'bout me
Best believe my niggas gon' pull up
Chopper dancin', it gon' make your bitch ass pull up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
Next thing you know a nigga pulled up
Next thing you know a nigga pulled up
Next thing you know a nigga pulled up
Next thing you know a nigga pulled up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Pull up on a nigga in a new car
Then I might pull up on 'em in their boo car
Fuck one, I'ma pull up with two Glocks
Still throwin' money in the shoebox
Still got hoes on the south side
Offset, 24's make it low ride
Talk shit, I shoot out both eyes
I've done did a lot of shit they don't know about
Me and Thugga, and we got a hunna bitches on the way
I got brothers who grew up in them trenches without a thang
Without my name, I wouldn't be shit, that's why they're hatin'
(Rich Homie) Thank you Lord, I made it
And when it come to  strip club, my favorite

[Hook: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
Magic City, Follies, Bitches wildin', make me pull up (pull up, pull up)

Best believe my niggas gon' pull up
Chopper dancin', it gon' make your bitch ass pull up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
Next thing you know a nigga pulled up
Next thing you know a nigga pulled up
Next thing you know a nigga pulled up
Next thing you know a nigga pulled up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'ma hit it from the back
I'ma pull up on a nigga with a bitch, pussy wetter than a lake
Young Quan got a nigga's bitch
Clamped to the seat in the back of the new car, no pay
Got more loud than a parade
No copy but her face I paste
Hoes fight I say like a race
Chop a nigga in, body 3, no way
Young nigga, diamond yellow like I go to maize
Wait, I'm movin' these birds, nut in your face
Skeet skeet skeet (nut in your face)
Swear to God I think a blunt came with my shoes
(That's the way they lay laced)
Get the fuck out my face and pull up to

[Hook: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
Magic City, Follies, Bitches wildin', make me pull up (pull up, pull up)
Molly cleaner than a stylist, plus I pulled up
If a nigga come around talkin' 'bout me
Best believe my niggas gon' pull up
Chopper dancin', it gon' make your bitch ass pull up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
Next thing you know a nigga pulled up
Next thing you know a nigga pulled up
Next thing you know a nigga pulled up
Next thing you know a nigga pulled up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan and Young Thug]
I don't know none of these niggas
All my niggas, they bout it, best believe they'll pull up, pull up
And I ain't even stunt a little bit
But if she want dick, best believe I'ma pull up, pull up
And I'ma pull up in the latest Bentley
With your lady with me, make her mini skirt pull up, pull up
I'ma try to make it hurt pull up, pull up
LeBron at the baseline pull up, pull up
I don't know none of these people
I don't know none of these people
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Gotta check my side, how you feel Thug?
And I swear I don't know nothin' 'bout these niggas
Know nothin' 'bout these bitches, nah
