[Intro: Young Thug]
(Yeah, yeah)
Re-up out my bank, trip out my bank
(okay!)
We Got London on da Track

[Bridge: Young Thug]
I got lots of haters
I spend sheets of paper, I need me some paper
Famo need that flavor, we gon' get it by any means
I'ma stay straight like a spleen, I'm your majesty, you're the diva
You after, hey boy

[Verse 1: Birdman]
You know I'm bout my paper, you know I'm bout my team
You know I'm bout my family, if I don't make it in a instant
I put her down with my clique, I got a bad bitch that talk shit
I know the Freeband Gang from that six, I started switching lanes in that bitch
Smoking indo, nigga stay in, Mannie Fresh pimping in the play pen
Nigga have a bubble eye lens in a muthafuckin' new Benz
Japanese chopper with the double twins, it ain't safe in that water
And I am the new Prada (count up)

[Hook: Young Thug]
1, 2 , 3 , 4 , 5...
All my bloods, they surviving off us
Imma ride for the cause, I might be bad like a boss
I might end up down with my clique, laugh at hoes with my bitch
Pappadeux's with her lips, love is heavy, like a ship
Yeahhh oh fuckkk
Baby do your thang for me
Baby do your thang for me, ayy
When on that bullshit she just casually...

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Baby girl I swear
If you can't stand no more I'm gon give that ass a chair
I do her wrong and I know she gon' still be there
Big dog when I lay down like a bear
Tell a nigga cut the plug
Then I send a nigga to the sky with it, a nigga lose his life in my business
Bustin' on her thigh with it, bring paper, nigga know you need supplies with it
Thinking 'bout running off, you'll die with it (YEAH)
Never say no baby, do it (YEAH)
I want ravioli-oli at the stay in, laughing at these niggas like a baby (YEAH)
Can't see me like the muthafuckin' shoe that a bride wearing
And I'm a shark nigga, stay in, it ain't safe in that water
No

[Hook: Young Thug]
1, 2 , 3 , 4 , 5...
All my bloods, they surviving off us
Imma ride for the cause, I might be bad like a boss
I might end up down with my clique, laugh at hoes with my bitch
Pappadeux's with her lips, love is heavy, like a ship
Yeahhh oh fuckkk
Baby do your thang with me
Baby do your thang with me, ayy
When on that bullshit she just casually...

[Outro: Birdman]
How she dress casually
And pull up on that BS
(Yeah yeah yeah)
I don't know how she do this shit
Everytime she get pissed
She looks so sexy
