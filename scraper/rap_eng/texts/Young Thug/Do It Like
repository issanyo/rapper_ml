[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
I'ma just hit my cup in the booth you know what I'm sayin'
And I got ice in that motherfucker too
And it's [?] like jewelry

[Chorus: Young Thug & Future]
I'm running out of money (running out of money)
I need another loan (yeah yeah)
Fuck nigga playin' (fuck nigga playin')
We'll come wipe your nose (wipe a nigga nose)
My niggas all vultures (niggas all vultures)
I ran 'em off the road (yeah yeah)
[?] (yeah, aye)
Designer our clothes (designer, designer)
My bitches all bad (bitches all bad)
They kicking nigga doors (woohoo!)
I do it by myself (do it by myself)
I split it with the bro's (yeah yeah)
I do it like (yeah yeah)
I do it like woah (do it like, do it like woah)
The red light (do it like, red light) (slatt)
Or the midnight blows (the midnight blows)

[Verse 1: Future & Young Thug]
I'm running through racks, I need another safe
I'm running through racks, I'm running out of space
I bought a new Ghost, fucking up cake
I ran through a check like Usain (God damn!)
And I'm drinking my cup, [?] in a blue flame (woohoo!)
When you fucking on a stripper, better keep putting change
VVS's on me and I'm covered up
Got my cup pink like it's Robituss'
On a double cup, watch me fuck it up
I done had enough, I ain't had enough
Put my main bitch on payroll
I don't wear them shits, they a day old
I'm a plug now, call me Pedro (facts)
Keep the money machine in the trunk with me (facts)
Slatt slatt, and the case closed
Slatt slatt, now the case closed (slatt slatt)
Matte grey on the Range Rove'
And I'm busting checks nigga, 44 (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm running out of money (running out of money)
I need another loan (yeah yeah)
Fuck nigga playin' (fuck nigga playin')
We'll come wipe your nose (wipe a nigga nose)
My niggas all vultures (niggas all vultures, Jeffery)
I ran 'em off the road (yeah yeah)
[?] (yeah, oh)
Designer our clothes (designer, designer)
My bitches all bad (bitches all bad)
They kicking nigga doors (woohoo!)
I do it by myself (woah, yeah)
I split it with the bro's (yeah yeah)
I do it like (do it like)
I do it like woah (yeah yeah, for hoes)
The red light (red light)
Or the midnight blows (slatt slatt)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Whole lotta racks, a little bit of space
I treat a bitch bad, I bust it on her face (here you go bae)
My pockets on Bible, I wanna be like Mase
My music on Tidal but I don't know Jay
Coming with a razor, razor
The midnight blazer, blazer
I got me a Gucci [?] jeans on my blazer baby
Gotta go to another county, we'll see my neighbors baby
She'll never never fit my standards, my [?] (facts)
Put a muhfuckin' FN to [?]
All my babies got good hair like my baby mom Migos (like they Migos)

Nigga got climb on a muhfuckin' latter so you talkin' bout B-roll
He know (yeah yeah)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm running out of money (running out of money)

Fuck nigga playin' (fuck nigga playin')
We'll come wipe your nose (wipe a nigga nose)
My niggas all vultures (niggas all vultures)
I ran 'em off the road (yeah yeah)
[?] (yeah, oh)
Designer our clothes (designer, designer)
My bitches all bad (bitches all bad)
They kicking nigga doors (woohoo!)
