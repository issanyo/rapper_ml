[Intro: Young Thug]
A hundo
It's a lot of fuck niggas with money, I'm just honest
Diamonds on me bling, yeah, yeah, you know they honest
It's a whole lot of fuck niggas with money, I'm just honest wit' you

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Pocket full of bread like a dinner roll
Hopped up out the Porsche right into the Rolls
All these diamonds on me wet like Canc√∫n
'Bout to take my dog up like a  damn balloon
100 racks inside the club I'm the tycoon
Ain't no need for you never, I'll one night you
I put P's in the pot, only got back a few
Real diamond, closet full of Christian Loubs
Stacking tall like Yao Ming
Everyday young nigga dreaming
Real boss without the suit, Balmain jeans
Red cross, come to Cleveland everybody me
'Bout to switch this shit up like I'm Mase
I beat this case I don't drink but I bought a case
My diamonds loud call me parade
I know, I was gon' be on
I'm out the streets I'm bout to motherfucking race

[Hook: Duggie & Young Thug]
Just because you rich
Don't make you real, that's a hundred nigga (a hundo nigga)
A hundo
It's a lot of fuck nigga with money, to be honest with ya
It's a lot of fuck nigga with money, I'm just honest
Just because you rich
Don't make you real, that's a hundred nigga
Diamonds on me bling, yeah, yeah, you know, they honest
It's a lot of fuck niggas with money to be honest with ya
It's a whole lot of fuck niggas with money, I'm just honest wit' you

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
My shawty thicker than yours
My jeweler iller than yours, I want my diamonds adorable (yeah)
My diamonds hit from the floor
I ain't talkin' STD, but I'm 'bout to take over your ward (I'm 'bout to take over the ward)
I drink Act', like I'm bored, I drink it everyday, it's a sport
I got bitches out of Aces in New York
Balmain britches, my gators got goosebumps
I'm sauce, sauce, saucy, I'm fresher, than a cold cut
Cops get off me
I Cartier my handcuffs
You can see the difference in my mug shot
I got my cash up, hundred duffle bags up
Hey
