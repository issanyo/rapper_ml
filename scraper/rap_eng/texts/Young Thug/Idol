[Intro]
*Lighter flicks and inhale*
(We got London On Da Track)

[Verse 1]
I think my idol is a hater
Fuck him, flush him like a radiator (woo)
Lil' bitch, I'm ballin' like a pacer (ballin')
New condo sittin' on like twenty acres
She covered in white, just like a mansion waiter (and what?)
I load her with cake like she's an Easy Baker (ooh)
Harley Davidson with a stick like Tomb Raider
Packin' this bitch with the wood, ha, paper (woo)
Mitsubishi stuffed with them birdies, nigga (brrr)
You think I'm gay when I go 730, don't get discouraged, nigga (brrr)
You the type of nigga that leave and take the purses, nigga (brrr)
And you should know my behavior's the worstest, nigga (brrr)

[Chorus]
Stop playin' (brrr)
Stop playin' (brrr)
Stop playin' (brrr)
Mmmmmmm, stop playin' (brrr)
Mmmmmmm, stop playin' (brrr)
Ooooh-ahhhh, stop playin' (brrr)
Aahh (brrr)

[Verse 2]
I just bought my bitch a booty, nigga (brrr)
25 bands spent on a scooter, nigga (brrr)
You niggas signed to him, I'm just tutorin', nigga (brrr)
Hey, I feel lucky like a Buddha, nigga (brrr)
"Alphabet boys" is what we call y'all (brrr)
Even though your pussy tall, you a small dog (brrr)
Rick Ross y'all (brrr)
[?], I spotted you with the kid for the bands [?] (woo)
Even if you JAY Z, bitch, I'm the hundredth problem (woo)
I make her jump like she was born a frog (woo)
Tell me if you love me like the fuckin' law (woo)
Bitch, I'm drinkin' mud like I'm a fuckin' hog (lean)
I got three hoes like I'm Santa fuckin' Claus (woo)
I'm with Bird from Magnolia, he sharp like lion claws (brrr)
Pina colada, I got a choppa y'all (brrr)
And I'ma run it to the top, yeah, I'ma run it now (ha)
Hahaha

[Chorus]
Stop playin' (brrr)
Stop playin' (brrr)
Stop playin' (brrr)
Mmmmmmm, stop playin' (brrr)
Mmmmmmm, stop playin' (brrr)
Ooooh-ahhhh, stop playin' (brrr)
Aahh (brrr)
