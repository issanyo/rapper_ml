Got introduced to this paper
Told bro, see you later
Now it’s…baby
Got 3-4 stuffed in a garcia vegas

I got pies, I make ‘em like I’mma need ‘em
I’m a baker, I got green by the acre
I serve ‘em like a waiter
I got pies, I make ‘em like I’mma need ‘em
I’m a baker, I got green by the acre
I'll serve ‘em like a waiter

Chilling at the house with your spouse, rolling purple
Go and give the pussy to a gangsta, work it…
You boys wanna ball like the squad, nigga, save ‘em
I was 14 dropping off a pager…flavor
…fuck with any nigga say
…she tryna get with it

Got introduced to this paper
Told bro, see you later
Now it’s…baby

And I got that work, serve it to whoever want it
Don’t buy the spot, real nigga, you can earn it
I can handle what’s in front of me, show me my opponent
Sleeping with that chopper, nigga, I can never be lonely
With other men I’m shooting but I’m neighborhood lurking
Now I’m speaking for the hood like a neighborhood spokesman
Surrounded by them riches, them broke days is gone
Now…I’m never home
Told these hoes leave me alone, I’m so in my zone
…young nigga and a molly by the fucking Prada

Got introduced to this paper
Told bro, see you later
Now it’s…baby

I got them bands in my trunk…I just made a few cows
I been grinding all week, no sleep, I ain’t had enough
I never gave to that paper, got this location on map
That’s why I don’t beat it, nigga, too much money in my way
I got all these damn babes now I be feeling just like Chase…
