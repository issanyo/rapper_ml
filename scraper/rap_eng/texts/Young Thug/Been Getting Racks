[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'ma fly to L.A, I been getting them racks
Tired of chasing that money, fuck her front and her back
I don't ever talk smack, pussy you ain't taking jack
I don't like cats, I like jags, I drink drank by the keg
I won't hit if it's stankin', suck that dick while you planking
I might buy new Acres, climb in it like a Wrangler
Substituting these whores
As I'm flying around the globe
I'ma shoot you boy if you play about my woah

[Verse 1]
Paris Hilton my rooms, I get them racks up
Now she suck a nigga like woo
My new CD's are print, but it ain't blue
I got a K in my trench, it's 'specially for you
Gunning, watch them pop lock it and drop it
Got all five pockets full in case you think it's a wallet
Shoot em in the back like Ricky, no Bobby
I got hoes and they give me head without a pocket
Aye, eenie miny mo
I'ma fuck the bitch all of her clothes on
Nigga that complain really poor, uh
Need a new job better store up
Need a new car with some carbon
I don't make it rain no, I'ma nut on her car, let her snort some
I just went inside Nordstroms and spent me a motherfuckin' fortune

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'ma fly to L.A, I been getting them racks
Tired of chasing that money, fuck her front and her back
I don't ever talk smack, pussy you ain't taking jack
I don't like cats, I like jags, I drink drank by the keg
I won't hit if it's stankin', suck that dick while you planking
I might buy new Acres, climb in it like a Wrangler
Substituting these whores
As I'm flying around the globe
I'ma shoot you boy if you play about my woah

[Empty Instrumental]

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'ma fly to L.A, I been getting them racks
Tired of chasing that money
Fuck her front and her back
I don't ever talk smack
Pussy you ain't takin' jack
I don't like cats I like jags
I drink drank by the keg
I won't hit if it's stankin
Suck that dick while you plankin'
I might buy new Acres
Climb in it like a Wrangler
Substituting these whores
While I'm flying round the globe
I'ma shoot you boy if you play about my woah
