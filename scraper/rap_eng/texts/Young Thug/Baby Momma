[Verse 1]
I'm passin hunneds to the bong, nigga
You know that's nothin' but some pawns, nigga
That finger lickin' and my palm itchin'
I'm dead fresh, fuck a palm, nigga
I'm on yo' ass like some thongs, nigga
I'm brand new, just born, nigga
I'm gettin' hunneds like a fraud, nigga
You know we chargin' like Dodge, nigga

[Pre-Hook]
I fuck on your baby momma
I fuck on your baby momma
Let's fuck on your baby momma
Darlin', let's fuck on your baby momma
Still here for your baby momma
I get some brain from your baby momma
Get head from your baby momma
I get me some reefer from your baby momma

[Hook]
Lil momma she wet like a boat, a boat
Lil momma, she wet like a boat
Lil momma she wet like a boat, a boat
Lil momma, she wet like a boat
Lil momma, she ready for war
She ready for dick in her ass and her throat
Lil momma she ready for the Thugger, she
Lil momma, she ready, she after me

[Verse 2]
I won't hear you scream if you rich
I'm never gon' go out like Mich
I know that I look like a lick
I drop off your tongues, ya digg
A solid foundation, a nation
Believe this shit started in the basement
My uncle that died is amazin'
You see all the looks on my faces
