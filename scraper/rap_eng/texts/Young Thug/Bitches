[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Got a hunna thou in the top room, nigga I ain't playing bout money my nigga no more
Say she wanna feature, what's ya budget?
Bad bitches can't stop it can't stop it(Whoo)
MC Hammer can't touch 'em (can't touch 'em) (can't touch 'em)
Catch a nigga sleepin' in the porta-potty and
Run up on 'em then buss 'em
But I ain't tryna get in no trouble, you can ask thugger

[Verse 3: Young Thug]

[Verse 4: Rich Homie Quan]
Lame ass niggas (lame-o's)
Try'na act cool, it's a shame on these niggas
[?] times two
[?] in this bitch, [?] with this dick
You took her on a date but I left with this bitch
Cook it in your face like a chef in this bitch, yea chef in this bitch, bitch

[Verse 5: Young Thug]
Cook it, Lil' B voice
Juug it, Deebo voice
Pussy niggas, feed me more
I got birds like B-More
I got your main bitch and she flex on my wood like a carpenter
If the bitch start trippin', I'm Dwight Howard with it
IPhone, yea I'm blocking her!

[Verse 6: Rich Homie Quan]
Hunnid thousand dollars in [?] so a nigga gettin' paid
Spend 55 thousand dollar on a bar, but I still can't sleep
I say she love me, I love her, I call her babe
Feel like money paid for a nigga, I'm feelin' like ayyee!
