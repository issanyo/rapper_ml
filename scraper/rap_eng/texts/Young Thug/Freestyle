[Intro: Birdman]
Yeah, you under-dig, nigga?

Chandeliers with marble floors, boy

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
My baby momma just put me on child support
Fuck a warrant, I ain't going to court
Don't care what them white folks say, I just wanna see my lil boy
Go to school, be a man, and sign up for college boy
Don't be a fool, be a man, what you think that knowledge for?
She dissed me in high school, no reason to acknowledge her
Lead by example, I don't fuck round with no followers
Follow up on everything I do, ask my girl
Call the cops, I don't give a fuck, I travel all around the world
Wake up, too late for breakfast, I need a lunch meal
My producer cut hoes off, Dun Deal
I'm real, I'm Quan all I speak is truth, oooh
Come here, all I want is you, aye
Pull up, put it on me, baby girl, bring it to me now
I'm just tryna get in, then work my way out
I don't care who you came with
But you leaving with me for the rest of the night
It's over, got good luck, four leaf clover
If she wanna fuck, tell her come over, Thugga pulled up
That's my brother, same mother, different daddies
Riding in that Caddy
All black tint, you ain't seen this before
None of my shit rented, you ain't seen this before
Tell me just what you spent, nigga I spent some more
(Hahaha!) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Walked in with a new gun on me, ya'll niggas thought I was playin
Ya'll niggas out here think you selling coke, you selling can
Thugga, my man, Birdman, my man
Two words: Rich Gang
YSL Rich Gang, Rich Homie for life, aye
Try anyone of us you'll lose your life
Play with these big dogs, better have your phone, call it a night
I don't play no game, no way
Thugger!

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Thought I was gone until I walked in like the man of the year
Got an endorsement with GTV, y'all niggas drinking beers
When it come to Young Thug
The young bitch jump like she was drinking deers
Bottom of my car red, I bang for real
I, spend a lil 60 on Act', I drank for real
I want Quan medication, he got pain pills
But I need to see my girl to make my pain heal
But I ain't never been in love, I don't know how pain feel, ayyy
Do my thang all across the globe
That's why I spend big banks on all my hoes
I spend the largest bank on all my clothes
That pus' so wet, she gotta dry it outdoors, Quan!

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
Hit it from the back she like (aye aye), all she know is (aye aye)
Money to the ceiling like (aye aye), Thugga Thugga say (aye)
If you got a problem, then (ohh), shooting guns like (ohh)
Stupid ho like (ohh), condo full of (hoes)
I got stupid money at the condo
Boy I just moved in boy I ain't even count it (what?)
Niggas think they on cause they in a rental car
Everything on me and I own it
Number one at shopping everything I see
I can buy that shit if I want it
But everyday I wake up i'm tryna get my cake up
With all of my rich homies
