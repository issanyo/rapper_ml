[Hook]
World tourin' around the globe on the way home
Can’t wait to see you
Maision Martin Coat, Jewels froze like a igloo
You know how it goes
I just walked you out your clothes
When I seen you, when I seen you
I'm sippin' lean but I can barely see you
On Miley Cyrus I can barely eat
I'm a young mogul I can't roam the streets
They done fucke around let me in lets have a feast (Ok Ok Turn Up)
Pull out AK's if you playin' with me
All my niggas shooting they sprayin with me
I brought the black Ku Klux Klan with me
She jump in that bitch get a leash
I paid my lawyer not takin no pleas
Bae get on that dick and ride like a ski
Middle of the summer my ice is on freeze

[Verse 1]
Drink something with lean
Checkout my passport I'm goin to Belize
Lil baby from Paris wanna fuck me to sleep
Suck on that, get on her knees
Used to be broke now I'm stacking cheese
Yeah I'm a fool with that Mac and we having cheese
Like how the fuck you made a million dollars
Say you came from the projects and didn’t go to college
I did not graduate but I got knowledge
Activas stack it up boy thats your profit
Broke and you running round cappin just stop it
I came from Cali wrappin them boxes
Stuck it and She call me daddy now
Give her that dick on the patio
Straight out the three with her Daddio
I can not fuck with no ratchet hoe

[Hook]
World tourin' around the world can't wait to see you
Maision Martin Coat, Jewels froze like a igloo, 
I just walk you out your clothes
When I seen you, when I seen you
I'm sipping lean but I can barely sleep
On Miley Cyrus I can barely eat
I’m a young mogul I came from the streets
They done fucked around and let me in lets have a feast (Ok Ok Turn Up)
Pull out AK's if you playin’ with me
All my niggas they shooting they sprayin with me
I brought the black Ku Klux Klan with me
You cuffing that bitch get a leash
I paid my lawyer not takin no pleas
Bad get on that dick and ride like a ski
Middle of summer my ice is on freeze

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Middle of the summer my ice is on chiller cooler
I just took out a hundred bands and bought me a Muller
Niggas tired of wearing jewelry
Niggas be tired of pulling moves
Niggas be tied up with the crew
Nigga'll be tied up til he through
Duffle with gla glah glah, what is the cost cost cost
Beyonce Formation in his jaw, niggas be running with the cops
Tell him to gun ya down never stop, nigga hell yeah pop!
'Bout to Go Justin Timber with the forks
I went and seen a ruby with these rocks
We just be sitting around plotting when you getting out ya
A nigga gotta base everything around the time your in debt
It was hard but I just went prayed to god
And he pulled everybody out the ward

[Hook]
I'm sippin' lean but I can barely see you
On Miley Cyrus I can barely eat
I'm a young mogul I can't roam the streets
They done let us in lets have a feast (Ok Ok Turn Up)
Pull out AK's if you playin' with me
All my niggas shootin' they sprayin' with me
I brought the black Ku Klux Klan with me
She jump in that bitch get a leash
I paid my lawyer not takin no pleas
Bad get on that dick and ride like a ski
Middle of the summer my ice is on freeze
