[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah
No I'm not Jordan but I am the GOAT
Diamonds they wet like a boat
Diamonds they wet like a boat
Diamonds they wet like a boat
No I'm not Jordan but I am the GOAT
Diamonds they wet like a boat
Diamonds they wet like a boat
Diamonds they wet like a boat

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I keep some big racks right on me
I keep some nats right on me
I keep that pack right up on me
I keep that gat right up on me
Pussy nigga back it up
Chi-raq shoot like me in court
Hit me one time in my stomach
Purple leaking out my gut
Fuck your bitch I don't give a fuck
We get stoned till we throw up
I'm living life like the Jefferson's
Bible scriptures on my chest and shit
My pockets swole Nutty Professor it
If it came 'cross my table, we dealt with it
I need me at least 2 like I'm stepping it
I'm so bool that these bitches are acceptin' it
I got bitches that been known the bando
I’ll show niggas that’s with it no blindfold
We the monsters, we slime, we not kind folk
We so cool with the dope, we want molto
I know reds I know blues but no popo
I want ice in my teeth but no Coco
When I fuck her I perform the yoko
I pull up with gang members not solo

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
YSL Hercules, Hercules
I hide my dope and my coke in trees
Stickin' your bitch like a porky-p
I rock that white while she snort a G
Finger lickin' nigga, quarter key
Your money small I call it shorter G's
She up and down on it repeatedly
I fuck her hard, don’t accept apologies
Baby gurgle, color purple
Dick need nursing, gotta burp her
40 pistols, niggas lurkin'
Top Shotta, kill my nigga
Never heard of, get to murkin'
Closed curtains, no outbursting
We real killers not no crowd bursters
Psyche, bitch I'm shootin' every person
Catalyst, catch the wrist
Rabbit shit, fuck your mix
I’m the shit, she the shit
40,000 she’s a Birkin bitch
Looking, smelling, talking, walking bricks
Acapella still I walk the shit
Moonrock come from Cali, coughing, shit
R.I.P to Paul Walker, shit
