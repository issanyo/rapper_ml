[Intro: Lil Yachty]
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, riding 'round on boulders
Money sitting up, it sits way above your shoulders
I was eating pork and rinds with a bitch from New York Times
I don't eat no pork and rinds, but that bitch was mighty fine
I got gold all on my necklace, tatted up my arms
Now my mama think I'm reckless, got guns under my mattress
I was jugging since a youngin, free my older cousin Reesey
He from Hamilton, not D.C, I rock NBs like I'm Gleeshy
Flip phone banging off the walls, Gucci on my drawers
Why the fuck you in these streets if you scared of them four walls?
I was stroking on your sister, she was calling me her mister
She suck dick for a picture, it's Lil Yachty, nice to meet you
I was jugging off them stacks, counting up them racks
Almost had a lifetime sentence, but I beat it, shout out to Pat
Pat, that's my lawyer, he got me off them charges
8 stacks for that boy, he took care of the boy

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat

[Verse 2: Quavo]
(Migos!)
You need to stay up out the streets if you can't take the heat
When they said Lil Yachty hot, I'm like, "That's him or me?" (Lil Yachty)
Wrist like Minnesota, trapping Coca-Cola
Catching plays, Anquan Boldin
Jug out the hot box, know that it's stolen
Large sizes, all type of narcotics
Woah, got a bankroll in that big body
I love my Motorola, I love my Motorola
I love my Motorola, I love my Motorola
Fuck 12, they can't pull me over
Smoking on gas and that odor
Cook it up then flip it over
You must've forgot it, we 'bout it like soldiers
It's cold but I got my shirt off
Trap niggas can't fall off
Big sack of molly, golf ball
Big sack of molly, golf ball

[Verse 3: Skippa Da Fippa]
I trap in Minnesota like a viking
Flood out the Sky-Dweller, it got good lighting
We made the dab and all of y'all biting
Two thick white bitches, both of 'em dykes
I make a 50 before his acre
I was in the streets but I ain't have no cable
Me and Lil Yachty touch down at the safe house
Skippa Da Flippa, I will bring the rice out

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Cold like Minnesota, racks on fall, I told you
I iced out my Rollie, then did the same damn thing for my brodies
All a nigga trap spot beating like a pulse
I could put the heat inside the kitchen like a baller
I could fill your bitch head up like a lawyer
Ain't know, never 'gon sign posts
Big machine, big machine
I'm cooking bean on jelly beans
No need to smell it all, is clean
That money talking, Charlie Sheen
I'm riding Ubers with the toolie
I got more diamonds than your jeweler
I make her come back like I'm Yugi
If you ain't know it, now you knew it
I aim at her head like a sniper rifle
She can't be my bitch if she dyking, dyking
I bought her a ring but no wifey, wifey
She slurp on that dick and I like it, like it
No candy, she Mike and Ike it
No Nike, she know I do it
I eat that bitch like a hockey pocket
No Nike, she know I do it

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
