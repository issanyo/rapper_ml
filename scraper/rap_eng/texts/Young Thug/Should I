[Intro]
I was sittin' in the dark waitin' on the lock
To unlock, but it never unlocked (no, no, no, no)
Should I leave, should I leave? Should I stay? Should I go?
My plant trees right now, no matter what you do
I miss you, I’m leaving but I’ll be right back
I wish I could fly like Michael Jordan

[Verse 1]
Space cadet flyin' on the jet, unexpect
That Texas tea spillin' on my jeans, outfit
Bitch lean on me
Ride through the hood, no ski on me
Snake life, a whole lotta skeets in me
Blood like a vampire teeth in me
Jumanji on my feet
Ridin' through the hood in the Jag or the Jeep
She know Young Thugga gon spit
She know Young Thugga a beast
Then I come back to my senses like

[Hook]
I was sittin' in the dark waitin' on the lock
To unlock, but it never unlocked (no, no, no, no)
I was sittin' in the dark waitin' on the lock
To unlock, but it never unlocked (no, no, no, no)
I was sittin' in the dark waitin' on the lock
To unlock, but it never unlocked (no, no, no, no)
Should I leave, should I leave? Should I stay? Should I go?
Then I come back to my senses like

[Verse 2]
Get the fuck up out that YSL sofa
Get on the floor
I would like for you to know
Your popcorn poppin'
I'm like, "Rich Homie, stop it"
Yeah your boy trending topic
I'll go stompin' like Kunta la Kinte
Fuck, trap spots tucked down with the mouses
No not a club but her booty is bouncin'
I live my life stoned, no mountain
I'm gon' drink you like a Fanta
Then she switch up like Hannah Montana
Couldn't ever understand her
Come back to your senses

[Hook]
I was sittin' in the dark waitin' on the lock
To unlock, but it never unlocked (no, no, no, no)
Should I stay, should I stay, should I go, should I go?
Should I stay, should I stay?
I was sittin' in the dark waitin' on the lock
To unlock, but it never unlocked (no, no, no, no)
Should I stay, should I stay, should I go, should I go
Should I go?
