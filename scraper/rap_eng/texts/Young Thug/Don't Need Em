[Intro: Kap G & Young Thug]
Kap G times Thugga times Bear
Thugga times Kap G times Bear
Let do it Thug
Thugga Thugga Baby
OG Bear what the fuck goin' on
Kap G let’s get it nigga

[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]
I hate that feelin' when I feel like I been played with
You know that feelin' when they act like they gon take it
I know a lot of soldiers I thought weren’t gon make it
I know a lot of fake soldiers they betrayed
I ain’t no mufuckin' cheater
I know a high-life nigga that will need em
But I don’t need em, need em, need em, need em, need em
I don’t need em, need em, need em, need em, need em

[Hook: Young Thug]
When I first got that money I knew I wasn’t falling out
When I first met that swagger I knew they was saucin' out
Aye but I know that kush is strong and I'mma cough it out
They only look at me for so long, you know my leather soft (Yeah my leather soft!)
Yeah yeah I’m a high paid nigga
Yeah yeah get out my space nigga
Clack, boom that’s a AK nigga
High-life, high-life, life nigga

[Verse 1: Kap G]
Walk up in the bank like gimme
I got Big Bear with me like a grizzly
You ain't heard me and Thug just crank the Bentley's
I know my momma proud you can call her Penny
Fuck her from the back I turn her like I’m Timmy
I fuck her from the back I'm pulling on a remy
I have my brother with me just gave me kidney
Brother with them chopsticks like they eat at Beni’s
Bad bitch with me she got on Chanel
Vatos on the block, diamonds like Adele
And my Macs with em I ain't talking Dell
All my bitches love they will pay my bills
Ion need em, need em Ion need em, need em
Brought the beans with me like I’m even Steven
Bitches calling me but I’m in meetings, meetings
Like a dog pissing, now I’m leaning, leaning
I was just on CNN with Don Lemon better stay on my pimpin’
Tom Cruise I’m on a mission (on a mission)
I’m going through a line like I’m fishing
I can’t help you shawty I just like sipping
My money gettin' like Tayshaun with the Pistons
Put a mill on the Bentley I ain't talking biscuits
My bitch so bad she should be in an exhibit
I got a lot of green kinda like Reggie

[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]
I hate that feelin' when I feel like I been played with
You know that feelin' when they act like they gon take it
I know a lot of soldiers I thought weren’t gon make it
I know a lot of fake soldiers they betrayed
I ain’t no mufuckin' cheater
I know a high-life nigga that will need em
But I don’t need em, need em, need em, need em, need em
I don’t need em, need em, need em, need em, need em

[Verse 2: Kap G & Young Thug]
I will never retire like I’m Kobe
I will never go back to the old me
I know some trappers stay with the 40
With the big nose on the front like Ginobili
I got a couple models look like Naomi
I like it out the front just like I was bowling
She bring a friend; have a threesome in the morning
Yeah yeah great like Toni
Now me and Kap G screaming fuck the popo
And if they tryna ask me questions that’s a no no
And if it’s a late night we gon fuck a dyke hoe
You see my goons they’ll leave you holy like a bible
You see them karats on my wrist they like a rice bowl
I got the game on dread lock like a micro
You want me for a show hit my email in bio
I'ma need six plus yeah like a iPhone

[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]
I hate that feelin' when I feel like I been played with
You know that feelin' when they act like they gon take it
I know a lot of soldiers I thought weren’t gon make it
I know a lot of fake soldiers they betrayed
I ain’t no mufuckin' cheater
I know a high-life nigga that will need em
But I don’t need em, need em, need em, need em, need em
I don’t need em, need em, need em, need em, need em
