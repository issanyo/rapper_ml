[Hook]
I buy rollies in LA worth a milli
She runnin' low and she need it, I know she with it
I keep my bankrolls, I don't treat her like she kidney
Home of the falcons no football
I need them chickens
Bae, I need chickens
Mama, I need chickens
I need some chickens

[Verse 1]
Bae asked if I was hungry, only if you stop and get it
Diamonds pinker than a pony, running with 26 chickens
I'mma stunt on my neighbors, kids see me on cable
Thick drink, purple maple, I coulda went and bought some acres
Pull up swaggin', no blazer, cookin' dope with a apron
Gettin' numbers to the pager,  no no captain, we don't save 'em
Draw down with the pistol then erase 'em
Nigga soo hot they need a fan...tasia
I need a brown ho like a baby
I'm a hated baby with rabies
I ain't talkin' to the boxer when I say A.B
Aye she go'n open up and then drink me

I need them chickens
Bae, I need chickens
Mama, I need chickens
I need some chickens

[Verse 2]
Plug, plug, puttin' them birds in the box
Putting them birds in the truck
Stuff that lil' muthafucka down, stuff that lil bitch to the ground
When I pull up to the town, know that I got myself pounds
Rounds, I'm gonna gun his ass down, fuck all your hoes in one round
Burr, burr, burr, burr, burr, burr
I'mma pull up high like I took a shroom
Bitch I'm super fly like a witch with a broom
Thugger Harry Potter fly, boming soon
My nigga just walked in like he in this bitch'
No snitchin' we lead him in a ditch
Tampered with, ya dig?
Take his bitch, ya dig?
Fuck his kids, ya dig?
Shoot his wig, ya dig?
I know I...
