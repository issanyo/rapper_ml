[Intro]
Yeah, whaddup?
I'm tryna put my dick inside of your panties, yeah
And then I take this shit for granted
I'm at Rolling Loud, right there, rolling out
Smokin' Backwoods and holdin' bae
I was gettin' protected by my savages
Yellow school buses, that's a Xanny
Causin' me to sleep and I ain't plan it (yeehaw)
I got some jobs all day
Roll out the jar all day
I be on Mars all day
I'm with the stars all day, uh
Boss all day
Roll up the raw all day
Babysit your dog all day
'Bout to watch you jog all day

[Chorus]
Like family don't matter, oh, oh
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?

[Verse 1]
Bagged a bad bitch, I got a foreign son
Tommy gun, found a real Tommy gun
I dropped a milli' on my chain like I know Barry Bonds
And I got a head full of hair like I'm from Amazon, uh
Glaze that ass like a candle honey, uh
Ferragamo shower shoes for me, uh
Lightbulb, neck got jewels on it, uh
Like an old school, I got some pull, don't I?
Huh?
Sayin', abracadabra
Abracadabra, kill all you bastards
I don't want no wrassle
The bread ambassador
No nothin' else matter to him
I'm ballin' like Patrick Ewing
Turn up on you bastards
I'm in a Ghost like Casper
Everything go smooth for me like I got my Masters
Fubu Platinum up, birds in the Acura
Albums platinum and up, I'm killin' these bastards

[Chorus]
Like family don't matter, oh, oh
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?

[Verse 2]
Country Billy made a couple milli'
Tryna park the Rolls Royce inside the Piccadilly
Oh, he had a couple stripes actually (of course)
Got another half a milli' in white tees, of course (don't you panic)
Don't you take this shit for granted, don't you panic
When I put my D in your pants, don't you panic
When I catch up with your bitch, you know I'm smashin'
I can put her on her feet, oh, oh head gasket
You gotta tell me what's wrong
I can't wait to deep stroke to the mornin'
'Bout to put my dick in your mouth right when you yawn
You gotta put that puss' on my lips, whenever I'm on one
I thank the red doll, so I whip my bum bum
I'm 'bout to fuck somebody girl off this rum, rum (go 'head)
I'm chasin' all of these rats like I was Tom (yeah)
But it ain't even matter, I was tryna kill these bastards

[Chorus]
Like family don't matter, oh, oh
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?

[Bridge]
I'm fuckin' with you
Yeah, you know I'm fuckin' with you
Still got the factories on my coupe
Lately, I been lazin', blamin' blue
I kept that bag, swoo
I'm hidin' a futu
My pitbull blue, too
My carpet wool, too
My bitch out Dallas, I'm a maverick
My ear got carrats on it
But none of that shit don't matter, I was tryna kill these bastards

[Chorus]
Like family don't matter, oh, oh
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
What's poppin', what's the deal?
