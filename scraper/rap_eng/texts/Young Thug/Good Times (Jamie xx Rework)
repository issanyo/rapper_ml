[Intro: The Persuasions]
All we need is a little bit of honey, huh
Oh, yes, we do
I know there's gonna be...

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Work every day 'til me meet ends
I will turn it up on weekends
Make a toast, be a real friend
Tell me what you're drinking, cuh

[Hook: The Persuasions]
I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times, oh

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
Good times, there gon' be some good times
'Member used to pull up, and let 'em fight?
That's that hood time
'Member used to hold on your hand when nobody would time?
Yeah, I know that bitch trippin', she ain't got that much time
I don't waste time, I don't waste time
I don't have patience, baby
She tryna copy my shit, but she be missin' the hits
Wanna go fast? Wanna race me?
We gon' ball, Walter Payton
We gon' fly through the stations
Come here bae, you're a blessin'
And from you, I learn my lesson
Pop quiz, it's a pop quiz
All my money comin' clean, you can't pop this
But she can't get it locked up like locksmith
Watch her come to my lights, like a reindeer
Me and papi on the same pills
My diamonds, never stand still
Where you goin'? Why you ain't here?
You sold your soul for the mass appeal

[Hook: The Persuasions]
I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good
I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times, oh

[Verse 3: Dua Lipa]
We be ridin' like a mothafuckin' stroller
I'll survive in a mothafuckin' gutter
That's my mothafuckin' woadie, like the Noila
And I'm colored red like Coke-Cola
I'ma have a very good time
I swear to God, I can't never sideline shorty
She, she said she likes all of my man's rhymes
Where is my phone? That money be callin'
I want you to pass it to Thugger Thugger
Even in the summertime, me and shawty hustle
I swear to God, I'ma tip you, got to struggle
Baby girl, sit it down, you not known like an usher
I told lil' baby, "I don't bite but my teeth do."
I wanna control you like voodoo
I'm steady screaming free, Unfunk and DuLu
Every time I have a good time you do too

[Hook: The Persuasions]
I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good
I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times, oh

[Outro: The Persuasions]
Real bad, baby
I can't afford the fancy, fancy places, oh
But long as you have faith in me
We'll have ourselves
