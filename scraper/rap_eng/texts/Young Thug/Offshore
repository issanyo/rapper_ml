[Intro: Young Thug]
Ear Drummers
They think it's woman inside me
'Cause the way I wear my tees and my jeans, ayy
(Where do you wanna take me?)
Little do they know they women (Don't play with me)
Got marks all over her knees, ayy
(Maserati)

[Pre-Chorus: Swae Lee]
Rollin' off you
Rollin' off you, you overdosin' off my kiss
And the joke is on you
Joke is on you if you fall for that other nigga, hey!

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Young Thug]
I took a trip offshore (ayy)
Took the whip offshore (yeah)
I took a chick offshore
You should get out more (hey, hey)
And you should get out more, you should get out more
Baby, take a lil' tour (oh)
When we hit that floor, all the money downpour
That's what it's here for (that's what it's for)
Do it up so large, do it up so large, like a breakout star
Bunch of young niggas on a crash course (do it large, do it large)
Going overboard, going overboard, we can hit that store
Yeah and take it too far (ayy)

[Verse: Young Thug]
I'ma let you vibe all day
I don't mind if you try it all day
You know Thugger let you ride all day
Yeah, let you ride all day
You can go get what you like all day
It feels wrong but it's right, no, baby
Perky got me lookin' at your body all day
And it feels right, my baby, yeah
Baby steps when you walk
You got baby steps when you walk
High heels on your feet when you walk
High heels on your feet, baby
Lambo, them legs ajar, yeah
And a Maserati truck, the doors in the back ajar
Let's get it on, baby
Make your mouth get it, get it gone, yeah
Like a motorcycle, get it on, baby
Yeah, perform foreplay
So in love, I can buy the bitch a ring every day
Stop this rap shit, turn to a mob any day
Bossman, I could get homie dropped any day
I'll slap the shit out Donald Trump any day
Brand new assistant I like, any day
Better get it right if you don't want gunplay
I'ma do it right and fill up the driveway
Bentley on the side and it's sittin' on LeBron James
911 Porsche got me takin' you on a date, ayy
Pistol Pete mobbin', I'm bangin' it all day
Baddest and the baddest and the baddest like all day
I ran up the millions, I did it all my way
Hundred dollar bills and I like 'em all straight
Real talk, I'm a neat freak
And lil' mama fold my clothes like a neat freak
You say you doin' somethin', ya uncle reading right through your wrong
Hoes can't talk when I talk where I'm from
32 pumps make 'em run, Forrest, run
Monte Carlo, poppin' my collar
Wrestle that ho like The Mothafuckin' Rock
I say wrestle that ho like The Mothafuckin' Rock
So I let it freeze up
Eat the cake, got amazing cake
These bitches hatin', they throw rice by the case
I'm ridin' down Memory Lane
Catchin' feelings like I'm Walter Payton
I just wanna throw love at this evenin'
Christian Dior with the ski
Bad bitch, yeah, make believe
Barney Balmain on my jeans
Bleedin' like a Tampax Pearl
Mistake, let it rain on your world, ayy
Your diamonds, yeah, they wet like the bottom of the shore, yeah
Better stop playin', say you quick like sand, oh my God

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
I took a trip offshore
Took the whip offshore (yeah)
I took a chick offshore
You should get out more (hey, hey)
And you should get out more, you should get out more
Baby, take a lil' tour
When we hit that floor, all the money downpour
That's what it's here for
Do it up so large, do it up so large, like a breakout star
Bunch of young niggas on a crash course
Going overboard, going overboard, we can hit that store
Yeah and take it too far
