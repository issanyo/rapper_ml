Niggas know that Savage stands for nothin' nice

Pint came in and made this shit my business
Water on my wrist, it caused ten tensions
God, put your wrist down, nigga you want attention
If I catch your bitch, you know she goin' missin'
She gon' leave a note and say she gone fishin'
I'm sushi meat cause ho I spit some raw shit

Got that dope comin' through your roof, be cautious
Cause they know I'm ridin' with the dick
We not gon' play 'round with a bitch, ya dig
You stick on me, this nigga rich
Mils, got the package in it and the kick
My blunt got a filter like a cigarette
I'm swimmin' in these hoes, they fuckin' with the stroke
Don't play 'round with my money cause it's not a joke
This shit can get Italian, we'll cut your throat
You know this shit different strokes, different folks
Nigga went yellow gold, I went rose
The camera caught him in the trenches in the ghost
My bitch, she got some other bitches ready to go
