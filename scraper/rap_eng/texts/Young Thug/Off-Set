[Intro: T.I.]
They say man, they say man

[Hook: T.I.]
You can't be riding foreign shit Off-set

Bit too long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
Bankroll mafia, can't believe you bought that
Automatic long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Better listen so you heard what I said, ho nigga
Been known that I'm going before they say go, nigga
Try to cross the line, be a dead ho nigga
Give a damn if you wearin' blue or red, ho nigga
Listen, I ain't really much for the convo

R.I.P. Nando, shout out to Fernando
We gettin' keys til we here, andale pronto

[Verse 2: Young Thug]

[Hook:  T.I.]
You can't be riding foreign shit

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Pussy nigga know a nigga spend it
Pussy nigga know a nigga never ride rented

Fuck, so many rats, I can't feel
Bet that Coca Cola take away some of the pills

[Verse 4: T.I]

Every ho look away, catch whiplash
Still got the K in the whip stashed
Cut me wrong got your [?] dead

You probably mad cause I hit and I came back
Hit it again, hit her friend
Then I'm in the wind

[Hook: T.I.]
You can't be riding foreign shit

[Verse 5: Young Thug]

Difference between me and you

I'm the same nigga that tell a lil bitch that they gon' have to show us that
You the same nigga that take pictures when trappers (?)
You'd rather fuck niggas so therefore I pop 'em off
Pop 'em off, pop 'em off

[Verse 6: T.I.]
The beef I just cooked and just turned into Stroganoff
Belly of the beast, I was raised in that
Now I'm riding with a beauty with amazing hair
Kids ride past my house, say "The Kingâ€™s in there"
I'll make your head disappear like Malaysian Air
Hell nah Thugger, we gotta cut that shit out

[Hook:  T.I.]
You can't be riding foreign shit
Off-set Car ain't even out yet
Bit too long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
Bankroll mafia, can't believe you bought that
Automatic long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
