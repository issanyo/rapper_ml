[Intro: Young Thug]
All I said is for you to keep it real, each and every day
Aww, darling, yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Plain Jane AP with a Cuban link to match it
Diamonds on me dancin', got me lookin' like Michael Jackson
I don't want you dead, that's that Fed talk
Most these niggas polices like Matlock
Armani the jeans, Gucci shirt on, cover my spleen
I can't get enough of codeine
If you make me stop, just know you'll owe me
Good pussy, good money, good genes
I just wanna show you love
I'm the one that got you Frank Chesters
I don't want the time to be up, yeah
I don't wanna find new love
Like a G4, like a G5, you get fly-y-y
You a real one, such a real one, oh my, my, my
Never stop, it's always go
Send me nudes when I'm on the road
Send me nudes when I'm on the road, baby
Watch 'em before and after the show baby
Your body shaped just like a Coke, baby
But you already know
K Bangerz

[Verse: Hi Doraah]
I just went and bossed you up and your whole damn team (team)
Put you in designer, Christian Dior and McQueen (Queen)
Selfish 'cause I want you to hold it down with me (me)
Hold me down 'til the very end, a unity
How you feelin'? Know you got a lucky one like me (me)
Take you from that dirty, made you who wanna be (yeah)
Survival of the fittest, had no choice, become a G (G)
It's good to know that you can make it up up out them streets
You a star babe

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Plain Jane AP with a Cuban link to match it
Diamonds on me dancin', got me lookin' like Michael Jackson
I don't want you dead, that's that Fed talk
Most these niggas polices like Matlock
Armani the jeans, Gucci shirt on, cover my spleen
I can't get enough of codeine
If you make me stop, you know you'll owe me
Good pussy, good money, good genes
I just wanna show you love
I'm the one that got you Frank Chesters
I don't want the time to be up, yeah
I don't wanna find new love
Like a G4, like a G5, you get fly-y-y
You a real one, such a real one, oh my, my, my
Never stop, it's always go
Send me nudes when I'm on the road
Send me nudes when I'm on the road, baby
Watch 'em before and after the show baby
Your body shaped just like a Coke, baby
But you already know
