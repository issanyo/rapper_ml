[Verse 1]
Catch him down bad
Beat him with a bat, hashtag that (yeah)
I call it New Jack, yeah, yeah
Bitch, I got a blue Jag (yeah)
I make that cash talk nigga
I got a new house
You wanna get in, need a passcode nigga
225 on the dashboard, nigga
Stack it up and then you get that foreign nigga
Step it up and take care your daughter nigga
Stack it up and take care your son nigga
Step it up and take care that money
You know I ran it all up by myself
And now your bitch is drinking cum, nigga
My diamonds yellow like a corn, nigga
Double R at the prom nigga

Girl, I know you love me
Love me, I know, I know, I know you love me

[Chorus]
Bentley wheelin' nigga, bad killer nigga, back it up
Bands kill a nigga fast, will a nigga back it up?
Ape shit nigga, Godzilla, nigga, act up
Go ape shit, go Godzilla, bae, back it up
I just wanna have sex
I just wanna have a baby out you, girl (hey)
I just wanna go brazy about you, girl (hey)
Don't make a nigga act crazy, oh-ooh girl (ayy)
Cause you know I will
And I'm on a perky pill

[Verse 2]
This shit can get ugly for you
I'll pull up and bust your mama
I'll pull up and bust your brother
I'll aim at your fuckin' family (brrrat)
I'll aim at your whole clique (brrrat)
I'll aim at your mothafuckin' mama
I'll aim at your fuckin' dad (brrrat)
I'll aim at your daughter, son, nigga (what?)
I'll aim it at everything
I'll aim at the baby
I got devil inside of me (hey)
Got the devil inside me (what?)
God tryna provide me (God)
God tryna decide (what?)
Do he wanna leave me or sign me? (Who that?)
Um okay I know you're frustrated 'bout a nigga
And everything I take you through (Pablo shit)
I know I did a lot of sins
I hope you still let me make it through
Just cause I got me a spot in LA
That don't mean I'ma change the crew
My bitch trying to figure out
How she can tell me to chill without changin' you
Fuck it, I'm changin' up on 'em
But my fans, not changin' on 'em
Makin' a band, I'm sangin' on 'em
Whip out that bag, syringin' on 'em
Hey, hey we locked that bitch out with no passcode
I bought her some of those
Damn, she already had 'em though

[Chorus]
Bentley wheelin' nigga, bear killer nigga, back it up
Bands kill a nigga fast, will a nigga back it up?
Ape shit nigga, Godzilla, nigga, act up
Go ape shit, go Godzilla, bae, back it up
I just wanna have sex
I just wanna have a baby out you, girl
I just wanna go brazy about you, girl
Don't make a nigga act crazy, oh-ooh girl
Cause you know I will
And I'm on a perky pill
