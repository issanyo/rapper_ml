[Intro - Young Thug]
When I pull up on you, act right
When I pull up on you girl you better act right

[Chorus - Keyshia Cole]
One time I had to pull up on a late night
My flight just landed on a red eye
So when I see you better act right, act right
Damn right, you got me running every red light
And I remember when you said it's all mine
So when I see you better act right, act right

[Bridge - Young Thug]
When you pull up on me act right
When you pull up on me girl you better
When you pull up on me act right
When you pull up on me girl you better act right

[Verse 1 - Keyshia Cole]
Make sure your cellular is not on silent
I'm in the uber truck running that mileage
I got this feeling that you about to try it
I know your boys be only trying to roll up
Put down that 2k, time to win me over
We can get
You already got me, right where you want me to be
I can't stay no later than three
And it's already two thirty
You can't tell nobody, no I'm not just anybody
No I'm not just anybody

[Chorus - Keyshia Cole]
One time I had to pull up on a late night
My flight just landed on a red eye
So when I see you better act right, act right
Damn right, you got me running every red light
And I remember when you said it's all mine
So when I see you better act right, act right

[Verse 2 - Young Thug]
I remember when you said you love me
I never treat you like a hood rat
You claim to be ready but I (?) that
And I keep me some bread in the [?]
If you fuck around start bussin' she gone buss back
Should I tell her to hurry up or I should rush that
I eat that puni I got hair on my chest jack
We make her moan in the bed and the legs back
That pupu red in this [?]
I put the Xan on ya
Put some bands on ya
I ain't playing with you
I'm sprayin on ya
You know me girl
I heard you brazy
From the West Side yea
But I'm a south side baby
I go go crazy, I go go brazy
I go go hard on you like I'm with the Navy
Now don't you tell 'em
Or inform 'em bout nothing
Oh no no baby
When I pull up you better act right
