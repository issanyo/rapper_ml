[Chorus: Orono Noguchi]
Havana, ooh na-na
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (heyyy)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners
Havana, ooh na-na

[Verse 1: Orono and Ruby, B & Soul]
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?"
When he came in the room
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with
But I can't without you
I knew him forever in a minute
That summer night in June
And papa says he got malo in him (haha)
He got me feelin' like...

[Pre-Chorus: Orono, Ruby, B, & Soul and All]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I knew it when I met him, I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And then I had to tell him, I had to leave
Oh na-na-na-na-na

[Chorus: Orono and Ruby, B & Soul]
Havana, ooh na-na (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners
Havana, ooh na-na

[Verse 2: Orono & Ruby, B & Soul]
I knew I was there when I read the sign
Welcome to La Yuma
I knew it was him when he hugged from behind
It gets me every time
He's put in work but it's in the streets
He said, "girl, can you ride?"
And this is the part that my daddy told me
He got me feelin' like

[Pre-Chorus: Orono, Ruby, B, & Soul and All]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I knew it when I met him, I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And then I had to tell him, I had to leave
Oh na-na-na-na-na

[Chorus: Orono and Ruby, B & Soul]
Havana, ooh na-na (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners
Havana, ooh na-na

[Outro: Orono and Ruby, B & Soul]
Havana, ooh na-na (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Havana, ooh na-na (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Havana, ooh na-na (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Havana, ooh na-na
