Yo
Ok cool it, ok cool it lover
Mosh team they're my fuckin' brothers
Sometimes I forget we that got different mothers
I would do the coffin or the prison for them

I rep Mosh gang and the whole team knows
Every one of us have got a couple screws missin'
See me in Toronto in a rabbit pullin' up we got the roof missin'
Bottom row gold and these bright lights making every tooth glisten
I beat a load of pussy I've been needin' way more than just two women
I got D'Lyfa with me
He came with some Irish gypsies
They like fights and whiskey
Words of wisdom
Gettin' high and trippy
Smokin' like a chimney
I got illa billin' up another zoot
We could make your face feel loose
Everybody knows I got the fire in the booth
About to run shit, I better tighten up my boots

Ok cool ok
I just put four grams of kush in this paper
Don't think Imma pass it
Ok cool ok
I'm higher than Odin
They think that it's snowin'
When I flick my ashes
Ok cool ok
All of this travellin'
I got a passport with hundreds of tats in it
Ok cool ok
I don't keep company
I keep a company
That's my conglomerate

I'm all about this Mosh
Then you bitch about this Mosh
But you never give a shit about this lot
Man I used to take my mates for Chris Rock
Till the mandem went all super sayan I was sellin' Goku's
Everyday in marijuana smoke fumes
They can't hate coz the women play it so cool
Now we got the hood gettin' hooked like a cloak room

Ok cool ok [?]
Mosh team they're my fuckin' brothers
You touch [?] I guarantee you suffer
I put that on Jesus and my fuckin' mother

I rep Mosh gang and the whole team knows
Every one of us have got a couple screws missin'
See me in Toronto in a rabbit pullin' up we got the roof missin'
Bottom row gold and these bright lights making every tooth glisten
I beat a load of pussy I've been needin' way more than just two women
