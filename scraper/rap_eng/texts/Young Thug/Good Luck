[Intro: Young Thug]
Porsche 9-11 when I pull up
Park a million at the studio for good luck
Almost every one of my jeans are designer cut
Bad luck, iron dove

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
We sippin' drink out the pint and we don't even measure it
Some of my niggas they rich and most of 'em some felonies
I really came from the block, then I went straight to the top
I'ma clean up like a mop, I don't want to fuck, I want top
One in the head and I don't gotta cock it
Niggas be flodging and they need to stop it
Biting the lingo, these niggas be mocking
Run to the trap just to make me a profit
Tried to find me a plug and ran into the socket
Keep on the camera, they know I'ma pop it
Amir on my jeans and I don't want no Robins
Came out the trenches with killers and goblins
'Bout to go hop in the foreign, I'm doing the dash
Sippin' this lean and I pray to the lord I don't crash
We used to be broke and I had to go pick up a mask
Now that I got it, you got it, you don't gotta ask
Ran this shit up, I can't look at the past, got the task force on my ass
Bad lil bitch and she gon' let me smash, I like the tat on her ass
Hop on the PJ, we out of there
Overseas bitch with a lot of hair
That is my nigga, you know I can't lie to him
This ain't no Twitter but they gonna follow him

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
(SEX)
Twenty bitches out of Magic (twenty), I'ma tryna teach 'em all magic (let's go)
Ones bustin' out the plastic, got 'em eatin' dick, they nasty
Ridin' 'round with the madness, got a tall bitch and she clutchin'
Ready to pop your watermelon, ready to pop your melon
Pop pop pop pop pop, forty mansion drummin'
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, forty rip your colored
Bap-bah-rrah, unconscious, unconscious
Dah-dah, two just 'cause I'm grimy, ayy

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
We sippin' drink out the pint and we don't even measure it
Some of my niggas they rich and most of 'em some felonies
I really came from the block, then I went straight to the top
I'ma clean up like a mop, I don't want to fuck, I want top
One in the head and I don't gotta cock it
Niggas be flodging and they need to stop it
Biting the lingo, these niggas be mocking
Run to the trap just to make me a profit
Tried to find me a plug and ran into the socket
Keep on the camera, they know I'ma pop it
Amir on my jeans and I don't want no Robins
Came out the trenches with killers and goblins
'Bout to go hop in the foreign, I'm doing the dash
Sippin' this lean and I pray to the lord I don't crash
We used to be broke and I had to go pick up a mask
Now that I got it, you got it, you don't gotta ask
Ran this shit up, I can't look at the past, got the task force on my ass
Bad lil bitch and she gon' let me smash, I like the tat on her ass
Hop on the PJ, we out of there
Overseas bitch with a lot of hair
That is my nigga, you know I can't lie to him
This ain't no Twitter but they gonna follow him

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
Niggas they bite like mosquitos, YSL Saint Laurent cheetah (slatt)
Fuck her but I cannot keep her, nigga stay fly like an eagle
Still do this shit for my people, still call that bitch if I need her
Baking the K like Anita, and if that pussy got hair I can't eat her
And I just hopped in a foreign, this car don't take nothin' but diesel
All overseas I been tourin', I keep on meeting new people
Pretty lil bitch and she swallow my kid, I was gon' call her my sequel
Then I turned important, used to be making them plays in the Regal

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
We sippin' drink out the cup and we don't even measure it
Some of my niggas they rich and most of 'em some felonies
I really came from the block, then I went straight to the top
I'ma clean up like a mop, I don't want to fuck, I want top
One in the head and I don't gotta cock it
Niggas be flodging and they need to stop it
Biting the lingo, these niggas be mocking
Run to the trap just to make me a profit
Tried to find me a plug and ran into the socket
Keep on the camera, they know I'ma pop it
Amir on my jeans and I don't want no Robins
Came out the trenches with killers and goblins
'Bout to go hop in the foreign, I'm doing the dash
Sippin' this lean and I pray to the lord I don't crash
We used to be broke and I had to go pick up a mask
Now that I got it, you got it, you don't gotta ask
Ran this shit up, I can't look at the past, got the task force on my ass
Bad lil bitch and she gon' let me smash, I like the tat on her ass
Hop on the PJ, we out of there
Overseas bitch with a lot of hair
