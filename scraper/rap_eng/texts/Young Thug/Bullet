[Hook: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
Just met a little bitch with a long name
Motherfucker had more letters than Tennessee
I go gorilla in the pussy, (gorilla, gorilla) R.I.P. Willie B
I'm scared, I'm hidin' in the bushes
Bleed red like a nigga pushed me
Down to the ground like a motherfucking pussy
Last Dragon, feeling like Leroy
I can catch a bullet, catch a bullet
I got a lot of bullets, I got a lot of bullets
I got a lot of bullets, yeah, I got a lot of bullets
Got so many guns on me think I'm a bully

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
These nigga pussy, these nigga act like they want it
Little nigga better watch what you say
Cause everywhere I go, boy, it's on me
She dark and tall like Naomi
House so big got a gate on it
No cat came without skeet on it
First time I fucked her was in Daytona
But ion ike water, Thugga go
Tell her how ya feel, homie
If a nigga kill my mother
I’m a shooter, walkin’ out the corridor
For mom dukes I’ll top yo daughter
I hit you with the metal, no quarter
I ain't broke, money never shorter
Tour bus so big, I'm shittin' on MARTA
I'm a killer, I don't need no reason
Hate, but I only want the head just like a beanie, yeah
Money in the air, that's all I'm breathin’
And I only lose to you, you undefeated
Quan, telling me

Motherfucker had more letters than Tennessee
I go gorilla in the pussy, (gorilla, gorilla) R.I.P. Willie B
I'm scared, I'm hidin' in the bushes
Three bags like a nigga pushed me
Down to the ground like a motherfucking pussy
Last Dragon, feeling like Leroy
I can catch a bullet, catch a bullet
I got a lot of bullets, I got a lot of bullets
I got a lot of bullets, yeah, I got a lot of bullets

[Verse 2: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
I know all about these hoes, they not straight, please retain ‘em
We gon’ treat em like an imp, they fade, we gon’ paint em
Hey, I just wanna see that pretty bush on Kurt, no angle
I'm gon make that pussy hurt, I don’t get tired, no anal
I got a bankroll and a Beamer, I got this ice on like  a penguin
Gotta keep changing clothes when ya find me
Cookies, famous, I ain’t talkin’ Amos
And I'm quick to draw down with the steel, yes, stainless
57 thousand in the mouth, no dentist
And I just made a mill in the year, ask my banker
We hit 'em from the rear, boy, I know that they gon’ thank us
Woah, all my dawgs wild, they can’t tame us
She play with balls, call her Serena
And we are rich bangers, bae, you can’t change us
Draped you up from your neck to your ankle
Had to tell my brother Thugger Thugger, I
