[Chorus: Young Thug]
He mugging 'cause he know it's no communication
Every time I go see Pablo we communicating
I want nachos mixed with tacos, that's communication
Treat the streets just like a ring, we skating and racing
She wanna live like Casino and Young Thug
She riding around with Casino and Young Thug
She riding around with Casino and Young Thug
She riding around with Casino and Young Thug

[Verse 1: Casino]
Burrito, extra beans, that's communication
Them squares come from the migos, bales from the Haitians
I sell a hundred pounds, turn up at the station
I sell a hundred squares, Casino on vacation
Made a million in these streets, no exaggeration
Biggest boss in a business, that's my clarification
Thumbing through the check, I call that masturbating
Thirty-six for a brick, that's the calculation
Said she wanna ride with a G, pull up in a Ghost with a G
Nigga didn't wanna fuck so I let Kiki suck me to sleep
Thug say he took a thousand pounds and he lettin' it go for cheap
Y'all niggas hatin' 'cause an ex-producer run the streets

[Chorus: Young Thug]
He mugging 'cause he know it's no communication
Every time I go see Pablo we communicating
I want nachos mixed with tacos, that's communication
Treat the streets just like a ring, we skating and racing
She wanna live like Casino and Young Thug
She riding around with Casino and Young Thug
She riding around with Casino and Young Thug
She riding around with Casino and Young Thug

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Damn, hundred grams, Uncle Sam
Pockets stuffed, jam, hi there ma'am
How you doin', Wend Williams voice, Lamb
Porsche, I was broke, now I got choices
You know when she not with you, boy she in his bidding
She know it's some A-1 niggas with plenty benjis
She know it's RIP to OG Double D (RIP, RIP)
She know if I catch one I'ma turn 'em to three (slice 'em)
She record and she stop, she punch in when she end it
On the phone with blood, she suck so good I can't even finish a sentence
Buy Indian Remy, get it right out of my Bentley
Thugger F Baby and the F stand for Fendi
He load me down with bales and tacos
And in return he get those nachos, nachos

[Chorus: Young Thug]
He mugging 'cause he know it's no communication
Every time I go see Pablo we communicating
I want nachos mixed with tacos, that's communication
Treat the streets just like a ring, we skating and racing
She wanna live like Casino and Young Thug
She riding around with Casino and Young Thug
She riding around with Casino and Young Thug
She riding around with Casino and Young Thug
