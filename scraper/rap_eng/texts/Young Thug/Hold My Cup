[Intro]

[Hook: Shad Da God]
Hold my cup then let me dab
Hold my cup let me cut our racks
Hold my cup let me get my strap
Hold my cup give me my cup back
Hold my cup give me my cup back
Scroll my blunt, this an Iraq pack
All these amazing comfy sets (Margiela)
We ain't goin' back or forth 'bout that
We told em, stick for the whole team
I done got 4 rings would have won 6 rings
And we gon' buy, watches for the whole team
Chain for the whole team, and some earrings
And he's like, well we'll do no black on black when we got 30’s on a hoe
Any rats he'll light this stick see we got goons at the show

[Verse 1: Shad Da God]
Bad bitches link up
Come get leaned up, come get doped up (hold up)
I'm feeling generous today, after we fuck you go cups up
I played around with the Rover
Fuck bout none of that shit, I need some ice and some soda
I can use my old cup
Have 'em phone 'em back then call some cute bitches over
I tried to motherfuckin' told you
Nigga don’t need to know about these Corollas
Bitch I'm motherfuckin' juugin'
Watchu know about money, take two hands to hold it
And they sleepin' on Da God, what the fuck is it gon' take cause I ain't got no Folgers
Every hand with no Rolli
Rag round the stick don't let me motherfuckin' smoke it
Two hundred for the rag, it’s an Hermès Ion think that I told ya
Just cause these bitches be nosy, y’all don got cosy with the snub nose
Bitch play with them balls like the pros
Saw me whippin' Derrick that’s that Rose
All my niggas shootin' not no golf
Hold my cup you better not let it go

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Stop it. Pussy bald head not a fro
Copping, yeah she coppping but she not the 4s
I'm not from Canada Shad dat my whoad
Caught in J.C. Penny like a motherfuckin' toe
Read me a book, pull up with dog and they shook
I just wanna cook, we G and we don’t give no fuck
Slime all the crooks, we don’t give no fuck about no looks
We don’t give no fuck about the news
We pull up knock you out the shoes (o0o0o)
Fill her spot up whenever I want
Spent 100 bands on a ledom (hold up)
Another 20 bands on a ledom
100 racks in my hoodie pockets, don’t I look Trump
Fuck that bitch so long she need an asthma pump
She like baby boy you got to leave that molly alone
And I promise I'mma do it, I even put on my son
And it's a shame he only 2 and he knew that I was lying (bitch!)
