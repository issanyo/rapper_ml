[Verse 1: Young Thug]
YSL lifestyle (slime)
I'm livin' too wild
I'm out in the open with the 40 pound
Get down ,Pussy Lay down
My migos he bring me them birds and I get that cash back in a hurry
He told me to never take em off and everyone in my whole family no worries
I'm pourin up 4's, i fallin asleep I doze
I pull up on hoes and I show 'em my gold
(These niggas wanna take somethin, leave ‘em cold.)
I told you I am the reason you makin this money right now (sheesh)
I told you if you ever play with me Ima gun your ass down
I told you Big homie Peewee Longway ain't gon never turn down
He ain't leave his coat at the school but he still lost & found

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
Roll It, Roll it, Get It
Roll it,Roll It, Roll It Get It
Get up  Nigga
Go and Roll It Roll It

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Rollie on my wrist it cost me bout a thirty
Gold rollie on my wrist it cost about a birdy
Have a threesome with them bitches faithful that's the old me
Thug said don't hold the soup, pass one to my homie
Roll it, daddy rollin
Oh my god, I'm on that molly I be rollin
Word on my squad, im in this booth, with this 40
So you better pray to god
You one of my niggas better Hope I know you
Pussy clap from the ‘nolia

And a car that i'm riding is stolen
The dust on the money get older
Gotta stack it up, stack it up
So much money that I can't even fold it
She want no rocks, she wants that sand, that bitch

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
Roll It, Roll it, Get It
