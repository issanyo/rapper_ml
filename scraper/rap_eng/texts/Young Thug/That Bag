[Hook: Trev Case]
Give me that bag, give me that bag
And let that body go (give me a bag)
Go to the bank, go to the bank
And then deposit more (give me a bag)
Give me that bag, give me that bag
Give me that bag (I just want a bag)
Give me that bag, give me that bag
Give me that bag (bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag)
Give me that bag, give me that bag
And let that body go (give me a bag)
Go to the bank, go to the bank
And then deposit more (give me a bag)
Give me that bag, give me that bag
Give me that bag (I just want a bag)
Give me that bag, give me that bag
Give me that bag (bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I was just poppin my shit
I was just fucking on your bitch, oh ya
Nigga hatin but they won't say nothing (ye, ye)
Nigga talking but they ain't spray nothing (brr)
I'm poppin pills shit and I can take your bitch
I'm on a high horse, I got em round a bench (what)
I'm half against shit and who the hell is this?
I got a lot of water we can paddle it
Big shit poppin you know luscious topping, ey
I'm from Texas, Houston with a lot of water down
Look what I just started, ey
And there's no disrespect, but I'm at a nigga neck
If they ever try to check, If they ever try to press
I'ma cop the big bag and get wet

[Hook: Trev Case]
Give me that bag, give me that bag
And let that body go (give me a bag)

Give me that bag (I just want a bag)
Give me that bag, give me that bag
Give me that bag (bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag)

[Verse 2: T. I.]
Okay, kick more shit than a little bit
Spend a big bank roll on a little bitch
And I don't wanna see that it ain't worth a hundred G
Cuz I ain't interested in the bullshit
Live in (?), I did what you all to my nigga
Where I'm from, get killed how you talk
In the minute, my niggas remind you of O'Dog (?)
Ain't got no braids but still got them extensions
Extensions, extensions, extensions, extensions
Ahead on the focal, gon handle their business
I'm triple OG and still in my 30's
Still in these streets and still riding dirty
And I don't want your bitch in for pussy for real
No willing for me
Lil Dukey show, say I got you know he do with retail
Don't fuck, bring that back, I mean I'm in a hurry

[Hook: Trev Case]
Give me that bag, give me that bag
And let that body go (give me a bag)
Go to the bank, go to the bank
And then deposit more (give me a bag)
Give me that bag, give me that bag
Give me that bag (I just want a bag)
Give me that bag, give me that bag
Give me that bag (bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag)
Give me that bag, give me that bag
And let that body go (give me a bag)
Go to the bank, go to the bank
And then deposit more (give me a bag)
Give me that bag, give me that bag
Give me that bag (I just want a bag)
Give me that bag, give me that bag
Give me that bag (bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag)
