Wheezy beats, aye
Yeah, aye
Yeah, money nigga
Yeah
Wheezy Beats

[Chorus]
Hundred thousand dollars a Patek
Patek, yeah the Patek
I was in the projects with them guns, goons, they protect me (protect me)
Hundred thousand dollars on a brand new Patek
Yeah, yeah that Patek
Patek, Patek
Patek, Patek
I know they running with me and as long they gon' protect me (they gon' protect me)
If the symbol on the back is a cross, it's a Patek (boy that's Patek)
Hey, yeah, that's a Patek (woohoo)
Aye, brand new Patek

[Verse 1]
It's not a Franck Muller (yeah)
Go and flood it with some boogers (yeah)
Watch me fuck her then shook her
Brown seats, burnt sugar
I'ma get 'em smoked like Boosie
Pretty boy choking on her coochie
He can't roll a blunt he got cooties
When I catch her with him, I'ma shoot him (boom, boom)
Bricks white like tees
I got lil' mama on her knees (got lil' mama on her knees)
You better not give the bitch the money nigga, cause all she gon' do is bring it to me (oh my God)
Got that from the church
Go ride around the Chiraq streets
Take a private plane to the west coast (and what?)
Man my pants got creases
Get that bitch the Rollie what she want
I'ma hit the pussy and her dome
I'ma do her right, never wrong
Got a Backwood filled up with funk
Hop up out the Benz, no roof (skrrt)
I just bought my lady the coupe
Him him with the razor, now he loose (ya dig)
Pockets filled up [?]

[Chorus]
Hundred thousand dollars a Patek
Patek, yeah the Patek
I was in the projects with them guns, goons, they protect me (protect me)
Hundred thousand dollars on a brand new Patek
Yeah, yeah that Patek
Patek, Patek
Patek, Patek
I know they running with me and as long they gon' protect me (they gon' protect me)
If the symbol on the back is a cross, that's a Patek (that's a Patek Philippe)
Hey, yeah, that's a Patek (hoo)
Aye, brand new Patek

[Verse 2]
In the Maybach, ridin' with my twin while he doin' it like that
Motherfuck the Benz, I'ma loot 'em like that
Hunnid bands in my pants, got the woolie with that
She don't need no tutor man she knew about that (she know it)
She don't eat no noodles, man Chipotle where you at (rich)
Drinking Coca-Cola, nigga [?] where you at
And I'm still leanin', ain't no sober in that
Spent a quarter mill you can't stop me
I'm bettin' three thousand like I'm Andre
All my molly clean like a laundry (clean molly)
I'ma a big blood baby bumble bee
Been fucked your cuz where your mama be
Big Backwoods, yeah Koala leaf
Gators on my feet, yeah Jumanji me (real gangster)
Two hundred round and a nigga muggin' me (eyes on 'em)
Bitch back up (back up)
Give a nigga space, 'fore I fuck around and clear the whole place
Never scared, I'ma look you in your face
Then cock it back and let the motherfucka spray
Big money nigga, hunnids in your face
Fuck around and make me thunder in this place
All gold on her like a mummy in this place
All on my brothers ain't no [?]

[Chorus]
Hundred thousand dollars a Patek (woo)
Patek, yeah the Patek (woo)
I was in the projects with them guns, goons, they protect me (protect me)
Hundred thousand dollars on a brand new Patek
Yeah, yeah that Patek
Patek, Patek
Patek, Patek
I know they running with me and as long they gon' protect me (they gon' protect me)
If the symbol on the back is a cross, that's a Patek (that's a Patek Philippe)
Hey, yeah, that's a Patek (hoo)
Aye, brand new Patek
