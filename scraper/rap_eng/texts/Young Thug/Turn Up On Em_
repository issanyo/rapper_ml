[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I turn up out a bag, bout that cash I got racks
Every pocket issa 20 and a rocket nigga stop it
Why you copy, I got ice like I play hockey, bitch we poppin'
Made 100 last month 'cause yeah I'm poppin', hot like Takis (21)
I'm just gon run up a bag
She pretty, she built like a stallion
I take care all of my family
You gotta take care of your family
Checking the bag and it's next to the stick
VVSs got them shits to my wrist
We get money, we ain't bragging 'bout shit
Came from nothing, now we have it lil bitch

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I turned a [?] into a stripper pole (Thugger! Thugger!)
I had at least 5 hoes on all my bros (I swear to God)
I'm in Miami [?]
I smoked a hundred grams, you smell it on my clothes (OG)
I be the two gun teflon, all these jokes stepped on
My mouth getting prepped on, his jaw getting crept on
All the trap spots rolling, they bitches getting chosen
My ice getting frozen, don't roll up on me
He'll roll up and get aired out
Airing out all the spots, yeah I fuck on all the thots
Too many cars, where the parking lot?
First we robbed, now we mob a lot
Niggas see this gang then you know they stopped
Yeah bitch you know they stopped
Like the nigga called the [?] out
No you are not smart as I
Keep the heat on me, chicken, Popeyes
Yeah nigga bye bye, turn the white sheet to a tada
Make a nigga momma cry-cry, pay your homies, make 'em lie-lie
Got a red flag, fuck a bullseye
Like a car bitch I gotta pull out
These fuck niggas rat-rat-rats, gotta sue a lot (gotta what?)
And I said these niggas, yeah bring the plurals out (these niggas)
I ran my ward, like a STD bring the cures out (what!?)
Got a half a million worth jewelry on, gotta bring the security out

[Hook: 21 Savage]
Yeah my skinny jeans stuffed
And my diamonds VSs
I'm a real big player I can't pay for no sex (21)
Pockets loaded, chopper loaded
Bitch I'm loaded you know it (I'm loaded)
Give a fuck about a bitch, I pass that hoe to my woadie
21 (hah)
