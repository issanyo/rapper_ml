[Intro]
The beat is produced by my nigga Wheezy
That's one of my newest engineers...
I mean, one of my newest producers
I'm high, sorry

[Refrain]
I pulled up outside in that new big coupe body Benz
When I dress myself I'm the topic, yeah the trend
Unlike a needle I don't never wanna see the pen
Pile all my yays and I better not never see the lens
Fresh start, I wanna play, baby
Come love a boss, you my babe, baby
I'm eatin' like I ain't ate
And I'm workin' like a maid

[Verse 1]
Come through, won't you see me with my lenses
I'ma trap it, pitch it, I'ma I press it, then I tint it
I got falcons in the Honda Civic, I'ma get it
I got dolphins in the fuckin' fender and they bending
Help me eat
Baby don't let me sit here and bleed
I got Halloween, trick or treats up my sleeve
You can't Future me because she know this me
She know this me, she notice me

[Chorus]
She know Young Thugger Thugger
She notice me, she notice me
She know Young Thugger Thugger
She notice me, she notice me
She know Young Thugger Thugger
She notice me, she notice me
She know Young Thugger Thugger

[Verse 2]
I don't know too many bitches that know I write
Hand on me, suck on my dick
I'ma pull my dick straight outta my boxers
Then she gon' start suckin' like ticks
She be the truth when she suckin' that dick
And she wanted my milk like a W.I.C
She don't play games and she don't go no kids
But lil mama say that I'm it
Ice is drippin' like a faucet
I am hotter than a Taki
Fifth pocket, look like a wallet
Woah, woah no Kemosabe
I got Ms like talkin' Miley
And I'm still hot like a pocket
Baby girl suck on my balls like a basket
Get a nigga out of dental, tragic
Lil mama my money stretch like elastic
No rubber, I might just use plastic
I'm a real boss, I'ma fuck her and leave her in dirt
Like a muh'fuckin' Maverick
And I got lucky, I'm lucky muh'fucka
I might just go play for the Celtics
I'ma run up with no helper
If I get dealt with, get dealt with
Bitch I'm a muh'fuckin' killer
Earring bigger than a pillow
Eat your main bitch like a Skittle
Buy my Burberry at Dillard's
Boy you know that you not realer, a thriller
Boy you know that you're not built like that
Hit you with 3 like Reggie Miller
Mama askin' how he kill like that
Big old body Benz
She wanna fuck me in my big old body Benz
She need to suck me in my big old body Benz
I won't stop and I won't end
I swear, I promise

[Refrain]
I pulled up outside in that new big old body Benz
When I dress myself I'm the topic, yeah the trend
Unlike a needle I don't never wanna see the pen
Pile all my yays and I better not never see the lens
Fresh start, I wanna play, baby
Come love a boss, you my babe, baby
I'm eatin' like I ain't ate
And I'm workin' like a maid
