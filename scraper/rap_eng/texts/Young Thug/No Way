[Verse 1]
Uh, I flood that bitch she pop that pussy like a handstand
I get them bricks and bands and go do the Saran dance
I told that bitch suck my vienna out the can man
She started doing it without a command
I want you to feel this dick inside your hips
And I wanna eat that pussy creamy like a dip
Her pussy wetter than the bottom of a ship
And I wanna make it clap without a clip
Put your motherfucking hands in the sky
Throw it up, plus I'm too drunky to drive
Wanna put that pussy pussy in the sky
Wanna make that pussy squirt without a try
I might hit that pussy wrong and make it right
If I start from the ground I'll hit the sky
I wear big time glasses
But I got these bands like I'm fuckin Ray-Ban bitch

[Chorus]
These pussy niggas peasants, yeah
All my niggas gon be present, yeah (here)
Bitch I'm wrapped up like a present, yeah
I got credit fuck a debit (fuck it)
And, I'm the truth this not no flexing
I got, skinny jeans with a weapon
And, I'm the future and the present
Baby, pop that pussy like a Pepsi
Baby, I pick water like a water fountain
My money colored like a clown
Show me them places like a noun
She can't, can't ride this dick without a sound

[Hook]
No, no, no way, no-no way
No, no, no way, no-no way
No, no, no way, no-no way
No-no way, no-no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no way no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no way no way, no-no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no-no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no-no way, no-no way

[Verse 2]
I called my baby "my shorty", I got her looking up
I told that club I need 50 bands if they're booking her
I woke up and ate it just like my chef was cooking her
Or room service, watch out she at school nerdy
What's up to Bool Dirty, walk 'round with a cool 30
I don't care where they flying I just wanna know who birdys
Babe don't waste no time, come on suck it's 2:30
I left my bitch cause I found out she was too flirty
Yeah, I designed all of my pants
I ain't give no damn I used to spending 50 bands
Yeah, green land Tarzan
I got bitches piling up like we some yams
She wish she could get my dick inside a can
I got 3 lil boys which means that I'm the man
I'ma pimp my carats out a rabbit
And I get mostly green like a salad

[Chorus]
These pussy niggas peasants, yeah
All my niggas gon be present, yeah (here)
Bitch I'm wrapped up like a present, yeah
I got credit fuck a debit (fuck it)
And, I'm the truth this not no flexing
I got, skinny jeans with a weapon
And, I'm the future and the present
Baby, pop that pussy like a Pepsi
Baby, I pick water like a water fountain
My money colored like a clown
Show me them places like a noun
She can't, can't ride this dick without a sound

[Hook]
No, no, no way, no-no way
No, no, no way, no-no way

No way, no way, no-no way, no-no way
