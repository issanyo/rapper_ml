Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
You know, that you're my god
It's vanilla, babe
But I wanna know
I need my ride in Maybach
But I wanna know
I wanna know, babe, tell me if it's real, if it's real
You a warrior in that battlefield, battlefield
Steady green like it's cabbage feel, it's cabbage feel
Woah, woah, yeah

[Verse]
Tell me why, why, why
You still rushin' babe, I wanna know
