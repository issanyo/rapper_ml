[Chorus: Nechie]
What's your kind then, yeah my slimes in
All these diamonds, fuck you thought? (fuck you thought?)
Wipe your nose clean, fuck your whole team
We don't spare a thing, knock 'em off
What's your kind then, yeah my slimes in
All these diamonds, fuck you thought?
Wipe your nose clean, fuck your whole team
We don't spare a thing, knock 'em off

[Verse 1: Nechie]
Fuck you thought? (fuck you thought?), we want war (we want war)
Take 'em down, knock 'em off (knock 'em off)
Yeah my slimes wit it, I was born tinted
You can see who in it, presidential living
You can see we winnin', fuck you thought? (fuck you thought?)
I put VVS' in my mouth (in my mouth)
Straight out the south (out the south), I got clout
I was chain gang bound, now I'm out (now I'm out)
You ain't gang gang gang, take 'em out (take 'em out)
I got game for a lame, fuck you thought? (bitch you soft)
Bitch, I'm slicker than da oil, get it out the soil
Insane with them cutters, who want war with the boy? (it's Nechie, bitch)

[Chorus: Nechie]
What's your kind then, yeah my slimes in

Wipe your nose clean, fuck your whole team

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'm in Balmain, it didn't cost a thing
I'm not 2 Chainz, I got forty (I got forty)
I bust your brain, since we speakin' of brain
Make your hoe give brain then get lost (then get lost)
I paint her face, you can call me Cosey
Fuck a Ric Flair, I got 70 Rollies
I rock big Shaq, Chinchilla minks, when she cozy
You ain't gang gang gang gang gang, why you talkin'?
I bought 20 cars for every year that I was walkin'
Made her get an abortion, she ain't nothing but a thottie
And I got way better bitches 'round I can lock in, I'm so bossy

[Chorus: Nechie]
What's your kind then, yeah my slimes in
All these diamonds, fuck you thought? (fuck you thought?)
Wipe your nose clean, fuck your whole team
We don't spare a thing, knock 'em off
What's your kind then, yeah my slimes in
All these diamonds, fuck you thought? (fuck you thought?)
Wipe your nose clean, fuck your whole team
We don't spare a thing, knock 'em off

[Verse 3: Nechie]
Nechie slang slang slang (it's Nechie), ain't gon waste no time (slang)
Boy you ain't my kind, I get cheese, you drop dimes
Prezi diamonds on my neck, my wrist, my ear (yeah)

Get you knocked out (nah), cut the top off (off)
Fuck twelve, yeah we smashin' on a cop car (cop car)

Step off in your club and throw a dub (yeah yeah)

Southside, youngin' on my side on the mayor
