And she roll around presidential
With the boss weed presidential
Give me a price smile presidential

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Hold up what, I know I ain't smart
Done spent a whole hundred thousand on another bitch closet
She wanna fuck but she got to suck
Ya her knees got bruised
She stand up and I spray, that bitch down with uzi
No flexer
Everytime I spend a hundred k, I straight up stress her
Now watch me dress her
No Trinidad James go to claim from her neck up
I might catch a nigga bitch bust down on her then next her
Know I had to dress her, I'm not through with you
Even though she a nat nat, to me she new
I’mma catch her then skin down
No JC but she got Pennies now
And they 2013, 600 for her jeans

It's Longway PeeWee my status is a hefe
My style in the wild life fly, Safari on my shoes
Cheetah print Loubs, YSL Leopard
Versace tiger stripe
Ain't trying to sound too extra
But I dress like a rescaler

Put Designer on my baby, Every time I see her face
I love the way the fiendi hug her, She one bad motherfucker
She bustin, she bustin, got me feeling like a sucker
Designer stop her trouble
Tell her stop, my baby
Bubble my bitch
