[Verse 1]
You the best thing that I seen this year
Lookin' like a rose, pussy tight on these hoes
The Benz Wagon, G-Code, big tires and she roll
I take her far as she can go, worth a black card on the low, woah
Color purple for the winning circle, high off love with no threats
She was retail livin', and now she detail livin'
Take a walk in the park, and I'm like it don't matter
Sippin' on a nigga juice (act), fly planes out from Cali (act)
Maybe you should wyle out baby, you should back out
I see the park is full of rottweilers with ya raw dog, yeah
I see them they finna got off and they plottin' on my door
Smokin' on Tijuana send a pack out with no dough

You the best thing in the night, yeah
You the best thing in the day, yeah
You the best thing when you slay, yeah

Rock hard, with the ten cars, and the garage and a bed now
Wi-fi nigga, rock out, nigga rock god, till' you dead now, wait
I heard you want some bread now (racks), aye
Wanna be young and rich, that's what I'm talkin' bout (talkin' bout), aye
Make a band do a dance, call it rack talk, aye
I just heard a body gettin' shanked
They better let him outta jail
On big homie he a bitch
They gon' fuck him up for real
I'ma big dog fuck a vet (heh heh)
Put the fours on Chevelles (skrt skrt)
I was takin' act, poppin' pills
Z06, wide wheels (skrt)
Baby girl ride with your man
I'ma take a ride with the wheel (skrt)
I just wanna ride with Renzel
Save a nigga life outta bail

I'ma rip any beat
I'ma do my rhyme with the sheet
It's bout' the time, you can see
