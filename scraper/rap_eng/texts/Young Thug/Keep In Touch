[Hook]
Won't you keep in touch with me?
Don't lose it, don't lose it
Won't you stop beatin' up on me?
Ay, don't abuse it, don't abuse it
Won't you fall in love with me?
I say, stop losing, stop losing
You gon' end up winning with me
Ay, don't lose it, don't lose it

[Verse 1]
Ay, ima ride it like a Kawaski bike
When you feel down, ima be the one that make you feel right
If he gon have you riding, i'ma be the one that make you catch flights
Ima flood you in the black diamonds, they gon' think you a knight
Ay, I got them dark blue true's with the buttons like [?]
Walkin down Rodeo, your real hair like Indian remy
Mix match bottoms, pockets fat but the true's will fit it

And everytime I think about you i want sex baby
Dancing down the pole, you the best baby
I know you kinda busy but i want next baby
I-I want next baby, have my next baby yeaa

[Verse 2]
Ay, ima fuck you like i never did tonight

If i try to talk to you, you were mad we had skype
You gon' get the text I sent said "everything gonnabe alright"
Ima come to you right home when I get back
Girl you know your loving got young thugga like (?)
Girl you know you kill me when you act like a brat
You said the only noise you wanna hear when they rub is br-aaaat
And Imma treat it like it's never ever been treated
I say Imma beat it like it's never ever been beated
I say Imma [?] it like it's never been [?]
And Imma eat it like it's never been eaten, yeaa
Ay, and Imma come back for it
Oh, that roadblock? Imma ride past for it
Oh, I will bust my ass for it
I ran my money up, now I can afford
But you should
