Intro
Aye 116 for life
Shouts out to thugger, it's the AP
We started so low but now we are above em
We sent up some prayers and got us some blessings..

Chorus
All by my lonely I didn't have no one
N*gga starvin in my room I didn't have nothing
So don't you ask me homeboy cause I ain't frontin
I work for everything I got everyday no time for play I'm getting paid

We Started so low but now we are above em
We sent up some prayers and got us some blessings
We cooked in the kitchen and came up from nothing. (Repeat)

Verse 1 (Ap3x)
I'm eating like I'm never eating again
I'm praying just like I'm allergic to sin
Ain't playin no I don't do well with the games
I'm on a new level hoe we ain't the same
I'm very above you hoe stay in your lane
Got me a new bezel it came with a dame
Stay with a shovel to bury you lames
Whipping and flipping this musical Caine

And you know that I'm the highest
I'll still be Ap3x when I retire

Flow so motherfucking cold but ill be spitting fire
You cannot extinguish it, smoking that squishy shit, she got the gushy shit

Chorus 2
N*gga staving in my room i didn't have nothing
All by my lonely i didn't have no one
And now you want to call my phone? (aye)
But best believe I'm not at home you know I'm too fucking busy

I'm counting the moolah, chasing the paper
I'm calling yo hoe up I'm dodging the hater
I'm whipping this dope I got cash on my radar

We cooked in the kitchen and made us some haters
But pay no attention they still got to pay us
And I want it now b*tch I ain't got time for later

Verse 2 (LuDogg) (LDP)
Sell my music like a G
I'm talking G as In weed
Don't wanna fuck with the piece
Not talking guns I'm talking me
When I first got some money I knew I was hooked
Paper chasin checks make sure the money good
If hittas wanna start some shit I wish you fucking would
And kids wonder if they can do this well they could
I'm coming in with all the shit I get into when I'm in the zone better go
And I'm taking the spot at the top and I'm rocking the block and I'm topping it off with this flow
Taking a breath and instead and taking topics I've read and keeping that shit in my head
I put it out there without care starting a fire where's smokey the bear
Started so early but my vision blurry
I started out kind but finishing with fury
I started out homeless 18 years old going
I made it my mission to get it no slowing
Stuck with no car wasn't going far with my paychecks so low I couldn't even buy food
Crazy how life switches up in a moment
Now I'm about my mood
You struggle and wonder how life's gonna turn out
You get to that point where you feeling so burnt out
You got all these failures you claimed wouldn't play out
The way that life hits you you wish it would miss you
The time that was lost makes you want a tissue
If you want change gotta know the issue
