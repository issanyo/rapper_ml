[Hook]
I keep the Kushy on me
I keep them Xannies on me (Them Xans!)
Sure keep a bad bitch with me (She bad!)
You're not embarrassing me (Noo!)

Then someone gon' end up deceased

[Verse 1]
This shit is a problem
These bitches a problem

These niggas can't stop us
These niggas wan' pop us
These niggas can't do nun' but stalk us
I'm not from New York and I'm not 50 Cent but these bitches know I got the power
These bitches know I'm Eddie Bauer, I'll kill em
Then send your lil' muhfuckin' mama some flowers!
Send your lil' mama some roses

And if you trickin', yeah you owe me (You owe me, bitch!)
I know the code bitch (I gotta go!)
And I know you rouge-ish (You lyin'! [?])
You waste time, don't pop on your rollies
You living life bogus

These bitches stay bogus, but I'ma stay focused and focus
I fuck her, I fuck on her face, then I bust like a coconut

How come these niggas not knowin' us? (They don't!)
They know that the can't [?] with us, these lil' bitches all over us

Big ol' muzzle

Headed baby

They come round, they hatin'
You smoke that base and you smoking that basic
And that's why

[Hook]
I keep the Kushy on me

Sure keep a bad bitch with me (She bad!)
You're not embarrassing me (Noo!)
This not your average with meee!
Gucci and [?] with me
This not why they started a beef
Then someone gon' end up deceased

Suck on my Johnson, no Magic
Diamonds they dancing
Don't try it, don't [?]

Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah!
