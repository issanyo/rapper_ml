[Intro: Young Thug]
Yea, Thugger, 21
Let's get it
Hold on, hold on, hold on

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Used to be debt down (broke), hop out the jet now (the jet)
We don't play radio, Funkmaster Flex, now (flex)
I just got a new foreign, 'bout to go park the 'Vette now (facts)
And I got the dawgs with me (woo), yeah, better call the vet now (hey)
I want some inside head now (head), 'bout to call my bitch now (head)
I got a Harley Davidson now (skrra), 'bout to pass the T-Rex down (yeah, yeah)
I do the whip, no eggs now (woah), I got chips and VICs now (woah)
'Bout to Liu Kang kick it now (woo)
'Bout to chop it with machete now, now, now

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Real big tongue on my kicks (woah)
Baby, put your tongue on my dick (woah)
I put ice on my kids (woah)
I put red in my dreads (woah)
Act' got here with my medicine (woah)
Nigga pop, drip, we wet (woah)
Man I got some ice on my ankle (woah)
Fuck around, gon' 'head, slit it (woah)
It was heavy smoke in my chest (woah)
Might jeopardize my checks (woah)
I'm 'bout to pop another X (woah)
Then I'ma fuck on my ex (woah)
And I'm gon' pour my syrup (woah)
Not my Act', just red (woah)
And I had 'em on deck (woah)
Think he 'bout to keep my check (woah)
Green diamonds, on me like piss
And Iâ€™m a mogul not a peasant
I just got a new Kel-Tec
And it don't come with no kick
And I came up from nothin'
Louis Vuitton my neck
High end clothes on deck
Let 'em all read my text

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Used to be dead down (broke), hop out the jet now (the jet)
We don't play radio, Funkmaster Flex, now (flex)
I just got a new foreign, 'bout to go park the 'Vette now (facts)
And I got the dawgs with me (woo), yeah, better call the vet now (hey)
I want some inside head now (head), 'bout to call my bitch now (head)
I got a Harley Davidson now (skrra), 'bout to pass the T-Rex down (yeah, yeah)
I do the whip, no eggs now (woah), I got chips and VICs now (woah)
'Bout to Liu Kang kick it now (woo)
'Bout to chop it with machete now, now, now

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Yeah, Saint Laurent Don, yeah (21)
Got a lot of blue money, yeah, yeah
I cut my thumb, yeah, yeah
Bums chasin' crumbs, yeah, yeah
Gucci jacket, ah yeah, yeah
Fuckin' on the mattress, ah yeah, yeah
Got a Draco in traffic, ah yeah
I just left Magic, throwin' ones out the plastic, yeah, yeah
I'm with Slime in that Maybach and we laughin' (21, 21)
These rappers jumpin' dick to dick and we laughin' (on God)
Come and get your baby mama, this bitch a maggot (21, 21)
Half a ticket, worth a jewelry in my carry-on baggage (yeah)
Thinkin' 'bout pullin' Savage's card, you must be on acid (yeah)
Cheap ass shots got her feelin' like plastic (21)
My earrings cost more than a nigga life savin' (cash)
Fuck a weddin' ring, I gave her a mouth full of babies

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Used to be dead down (broke), hop out the jet now (the jet)
We don't play radio, Funkmaster Flex, now (flex)
I just got a new foreign, 'bout to go park the 'Vette now (facts)
And I got the dawgs with me (woo), yeah, better call the vet now (hey)
I want some inside head now (head), 'bout to call my bitch now (head)
