[Intro: Young Thug]
Uh, Thugga Thugga, bitch
That's Shawty Boy with me
And we here to speak on the behalf of this cash work
No offense to the beautiful people, ayy!

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You might type like a laptop baby
I hope you never brake up like a dreadlock baby
We never leave [?] baby
I got you banking, Red Sox baby
Pussy good I'm trying to sing to
I might turn to Osama and drive my plane through
I might eat your main hoe but, I'll romance to you
I'll use a college girl with friends, I bring my gang to you

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Okay, money talk like Charlie Sheen
[?]

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You might type like a laptop baby
I hope you never brake up like a dreadlock baby
We never leave [?] baby
I got you banking, Red Sox baby
Pussy good I'm trying to sing to
I might turn to Osama and drive my plane through
I might eat your main hoe but, I'll romance to you
I'll use a college girl with friends, I'll bring my gang to you

[Verse 2: Bandit Gang Marco]
And I get money
If I see you flexin', I'ma bring my ganng to you

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You might type like a laptop baby
I hope you never brake up like a dreadlock baby
We never leave [?] baby
I got you banking, Red Sox baby
Pussy good I'm trying to sing to
I might turn to Osama and drive my plane through
I might eat your main hoe but, I'll romance to you
I'll use a college girl with friends, I'll bring my gang to you

[Verse 3: Shawty Boy]
[?] right in my droptop baby
I'm all in her mouth like some Pop Rocks baby

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You might type like a laptop baby

We never leave [?] baby
I got you banking, Red Sox baby
Pussy good I'm trying to sing to

I might eat your main hoe but, I'll romance to you
I'll use a college girl with friends, I'll bring my gang to you
