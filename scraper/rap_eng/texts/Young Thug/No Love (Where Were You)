Where was you?

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Why you be messing with me
Why you be stressing to me
Why you finesse for the D
Your friends be messaging me
Tell em' stop messing' wit me
Why you investing than me
You cheap
That second degree
That's just a lesson for me
When I was down
You wasn't checkin' for me
You was not checkin' for me
Got arrested stripper Magic
She know where cash is
(Yeah yeah yeah)
She love my adlibs
I'm a savage
Matching Rollies got a bunch of them
Wanna a baby fuck the rubber shit
She was always on some other shit
Thats why I don't ever love a bitch
Like ya shawty

Always get into it shawty
Count that check and get in to it shawty
These hoes they for everybody

No wedding ring I wanna grind
Had plans on being with you til you was grind
