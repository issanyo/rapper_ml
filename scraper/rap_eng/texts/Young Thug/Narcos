[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Cowboy choppers, I got cowboy choppers
Heard you serving enchiladas, turn you niggas to enchiladas
I got big dog figures, I got millions in the vault
I got bitches calling me babe, they come from New Orleans
Take off on that jet, go get fly with my men
You say that's your bro, but you can't die with him
See all these bags, I just take my time with them
They all bad bitches, but they ain't as fine as them
Niggas serving crack, bet I break your mama back
Niggas serving junkies, bet they smell like Barry White
I got 50,000 dollars, since 2012 riding
Pull the 12 gage, make him run out his Nikes
First, take that kid off, put the pass on
Two, fucking on your mama, get my dad on
I got pretty bitches in my cellphone
Come with them condominiums, cause my dogs on

[Chorus: Young Thug]
YSL Fargo, just a full time Narco
He grabbed some tacos, and then grab the Narcos
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Yeah yeah)
YSL Fargo, he a full time Narco
Told him BFM for life, he told me bring a couple apples
I'm like
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2: YSL Fargo]
Slime [?], serving fish scale
Try to book some shows, I be busting out bail
Got to follow protocol, cause I got five kids
Got to find a real slime, [?] shit rep
We busting down this jewelry,, and I see that triple beam
Ain't goin lie, I remember the whole thang
Bitches fuck the gang, they fuck us for the name
Yeah, this that cocaine, if they play, I bust they brain
Can't keep it on a hundred, when I rearrange these frames
Never jumped out the Porshe, poor it up [?] in the dope game
Seen my first four in a half, I remember I was fourteen
[?] got a lot of blue cheese

[Chorus: Young Thug]
