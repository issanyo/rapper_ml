[Hook]
I like the way you make that thang roll like a roly poly
I like the fact you naked for cash and you ain't scared to show
I like the way you make that thing roll when you roll your head
I like the way you roll me but tonight you gotta hold that head
From da back from da back from da back from da back
From da back from da back from da back
From da back from da back from da back
Tonight we havin' sex aye
From da back from da back from da back from da back
From da back from da back from da back

[Verse 1]
Come here bae don't you run from me
You want some cash or something
You want a jag or some
Want a couple bags or some
Make it rain on em, make it lil wayne on em
Buy you real real gold, major pain on em
You gotta boss now, you ain't gotta stalk now
Fuck the cost, you ain't bleedin' no more
You in the loft now
Thats a Boss man [?]
Got real bankrolls
I'm good on Slauson
My coupe gettin' toes
I've been a blood since I can remember
Ain't trippin on being a blood with these young tenders
Got a lot of bankrolls on me I'mma a winner
You the natural, you the natural

[Hook]
I like the way you make that thang roll like a roly poly

From da back from da back from da back from da back
From da back from da back from da back

[Verse 2]
Go head bae, I'm done with you but it was fun with you
I bought Ferragamos for you
My night was ? with you
Bought all the bottles for you
Brought all my money for you
Picked up some [?] too
This Beautiful bitch that talks shit
When you say something stupid around her
She don't like the cubans around her
But she do love the [?] around her
And she need to quit, but its a boss bitch, shit
I gotta step my game up pointers on my wrist, now glist'
Got my swag right I could [?]
Wake up wake up, I think my heart done felt enough
Speed it up like rollie pollie, ollie
