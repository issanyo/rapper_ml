[Intro]
Young Thug getting back?
And the chopper super long

[Hook]
Baby, this is my life
Young Thug balling
Stack the money up, and it spend all at the mall and
Baby, this is my life
The whole crew eating
Bricks came Monday and they gone by the weekend
Baby, this is my life
I done wrote a lot of track
,they be like "Appreciate you, Young Thug"
And every time we about to leave
They be like "Come back to my club"
I had a show up in LA, them niggas swore I was the plug
I'm sipping on some syrup, man I think that I'm in love

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Damn, and every time I thought about quitting
It felt crazy to the Thug, like something was missing
I had to sneak and do my thing, cause I didn't have permission
Now I'm in your back yard lurkin, pre-mission
I told them keep it 200, I blast for it
But he still keeping it 100, like his dashboard
The we ain't had nothing for credit, only cash for it
And if he sweet, rob him without a mask for it
And fuck you, I can decide myself
And don't mention racks, cause I provide myself
I'm standing next to the best so I'm beside myself
And The flow sick, but the chopper guide myself

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
And they be like "Thug, where the fuck you go?"
I am way up here
Big fat racks in front of me like a chauffeur
And my son scared of me, he say "The mink look like a bear"
So that's why everywhere I go, women just look and stare
But my car is not rare
Meaning I pay double and the ring cost a couple
And I am not weak, but the Ferrari doesn't struggle
And I guess I'm a baller, because the Feds say I double
And I am such a winner, oops, my fault, I'm still winning
And you such a beginner, oops, my fault, you still beginning
And I get money on my own, while you steady depending
Believe me, I am not kidding

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I stack 50s and 100s because I like them
They don't want to lick him no more, they trying to bite him
I'm 18, day grown women, they trying to mic him
Plus the fellas mad, they angry, they think they fright him
Plus I made them think that I'm broke, I had to psych them
I went and caught the Super Bowl ring, I tried to light them
I blew the bubble kush in their face, I tried to kite them
When I left the club with they bitch, I goodnight them
