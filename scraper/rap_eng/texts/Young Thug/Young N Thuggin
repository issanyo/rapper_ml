[Hook: Young Thug]
Cheese, I get money in my sleep
Spot, spot stuff it down with OG
Take the profit and I throw it in a week
And I know the Feds ride around with me
But I ain't gon' stop, nigga, I'm sticking to the streets
Pyrex pot is what you get when you need me
Okay come see me in the streets
Streets, streets

[Verse 1: Tiffany Foxx]
.44 with the giraffe neck
Banana clip on them twos, nigga
You lyin', nigga, I'm with lion niggas
Welcome to the zoo, nigga
Magic trick, make you disappear
Family ain't got a clue, nigga
Been in drive bys with fly guys
Welcome to the Lou, nigga
New York on that mob shit
In Cali with a grill, nigga
But where I'm from, they don't give a fuck
Prolly kill you for bein' you, nigga
(Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk!)
We don't fuck with no new nigga
Everything on me new, nigga
Ruby jewels, nigga, no roof, nigga
Lipstick, Ruby Rue, nigga
Balmain dresses and red bottoms
I ain't gotta cop 'em, your man bought 'em
I ain't got a man cause them feds got him
I ain't goin' to work cause that ass got 'em
And that pussy put him to sleep
My man getting released, when he out
I'mma set him back on his feet cause I got that

[Hook: Young Thug]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
You know who I runs with, quiet niggas buy guns with
Put a price on your head nigga, they just live for that dumb shit
Posted all up on Youtube, just to feel like Old Dog
Actions louder than words nigga, so these faces I told ya'll
My young niggas, I mold ya'll
I pass off, they move white, my snow dogs
Porsche 911, 200 bands
Mac-11 make 'em do the money dance
Your dream hoes, my set-up bitches
They spend the night but wake up early to wet up niggas
That's Monica, that's Marielle
Those real names, they kill things, no fairy tales

[Verse 3: Chubbie Baby]
I'm having Scarface dreams now I'm living like Tony
All my jewels on real, niggas living like phonies
El Chapo, we're the weed gang, I kill you if you owe me
Got them Oakland A prices on them, let your bitch blow me
I've been thugging since a youngin' man I put that on my rollie
And the white coupe, no top, I pull up yeah they know me
In the kitchen, I'm like Kobe, young niggas call me OG
Just got 36 O's, I need $1000 for an Oz
It's the baby, yeah Chubbie, man Ohio niggas love me
Got them blocks on the Northside that's midwest money
Play with mines, boy get a big clip
Mobbing in the midwest like my dog Trick Trick
