[Verse 1: Young Thug]
See you peepin' out the peep hole
Gamblin' with your life, nigga, Cee-Lo
Three stripes and they're all green gold
Three strikes in a row mean go
And you die slow, oh
Nigga, die slow
I screamed when I saw the titties on Janet Jackson
I'm screamin' from the top of the planet
They first saw my swag, they was laughin'
But my bitch bad, she leavin' damage
I'm higher than a mothafuckin' ladder
I'm ballin', I'm ballin' on all you scrubs
Got you ridin' in your foreign, you livin' it up
Front's 21's and the back's on them dubs
Jeffery got a mink on, he look like a cub
Ridin' in the Rozay away from the world
Oasis on and I'm feelin' a grudge
Oasis on when I'm seein' you girl
Oasis on and I'm seein' the dust
Oasis on and I'm feelin' like water
Oasis on when I'm servin' the plugs
Oasis on when I'm servin' these drugs
Off white molly, I sniff it off her
All of y'all on hold on while I tangle my buzz
All white hoes puttin' dick in their guts
All type of hoes puttin' dick in their guts
Bad black hoes, they drinkin' the cum
Told her when she cum I wanna drink a lil' some
Molly bite down, man, I need me some gum
Cop me a Sudan I'ma gon' turn up a bomb

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on peace out, yeah
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me
Next time won't be, oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
For your mentality you play ball
You run 5 on 5 least three times a week
Glen Park down the street
Waitin' on you to tire
Retire with victory, play so savagely
Always fighting with them you grew up with
When you lose you don't cry but you lowkey sad to see
If we cut like some champions you'll redeem yourself
You'll sleep happily, uh-haha, smiling
I'm still working while you dream pop
I could never let a scene stop smilin' on me
I don't think they get the point pop
They forgettin' that it's me, akh
Akhi tell 'em I ain't gone, wallahi
I'm just all day running numbers
How the fuck you think I live?
Too many heads waitin' for my downfall
They're like "something's gotta give"
Boys in the building give me updates like they know the weather
If you ain't in the streets you can't see the sky, I'm out here
I could see the sky and it's paradise
On the regular

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on peace out, yeah
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me
Next time won't be, oh yeah

[Outro]
This is for when you change your mind and slide back this way
This is for that night when set backs won't let that much fade
Guess you can't blame the ones you choose
