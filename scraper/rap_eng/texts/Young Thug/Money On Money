[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Thugga Thugga I'm ballin'

I give ya bands then I dodge ya
I jump in pussies like I'm [?]
We scare them niggas off the scene
Them hundreds blue they not green
If you put mud in his drink my bitch take 40 bands like she mean
Run a sack a nigga 50 karats a nigga diamond bigger than a beam
I went down to like 250 still was running around this bitch clean
I was getting to the bankroll and I was back and forth with these haters
I was riding round in a Volvo now my condo in LA like Lakers
No Gin and Juice this was Crown Royal and if you hit it first baby come endorse me
A lot of bad bitches but a couple brothers and the one that can make us some suckers

[Verse 3]
More money more problems
I don't need no drama

Take care of my mama
Take care of my family
Put em all in position
Get em all some money
That's the only thing they missin
This ain't nothing I ain't never said before
I swear this been my mission since the get go
Before the road, before the hoe, before the shows
I had a good head on my shoulder so I know how it goes
You can check my resume and my portfolio
It'll tell you I'm a 100 that's just how I roll
I need money on money
Thousands on thousands
I don't ever sleep but I need houses on houses
