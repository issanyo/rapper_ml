[Verse 1]
Drankin' on pink like it's Easter Sunday
Givin' these niggas wand like it's magic Monday
Do your thing baby you know it's all on me
Made that wrist spin like i'm Paul Bunyan
All these diamonds flawless and they all sunny
All you bitches lost and you lost nothing
These niggas say they lost and they lost nothing
Oops I mean't they lost they head yeah they lost something

[Chorus]
Get away, get away
Get away from the Thugger
Get away, get away
Get away from the Jeffery
Get away, get away
Get away, get away
Get away, get away

[Verse 2]
I'm allergic to them broke niggas and broke bitches
I'm addicted to that lean sippin' and lean spillin'
I'm allergic to them pole bitches them poke niggas
I wrote this one for the go-getters I'm lean drifting it
Bitch I ride Rolls with the top down ain't no lean in it
House full of Rolls as they turn me to a demon jitt
Play with us pop pussy watch that nigga bleed again
Riding with them sticks and they licensed yeah they legal bitch
Playing bout my conversations star shakers shake them haters all out
Man she bad and she tall yeah she know about it
Imma spaz on her ass off a bad brawl
Bald head Scallywag, Scallywag

[Chorus]
Get em' all away
Back it up, back it, back it, back it, back it, back it
Get em' all away
Don't come close to me with your jersey
Get off me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Baby get off me
Me me yeah

[Verse 3]
And I know when you heard this beat ,I know you thought I was gonna go soft em'
But imma do it a little different, i'm gonna go hard on em'
Imma go hard on these niggas like they're broads
No homo baby check the cars
One-twenty on my teeth oh my God
Diamonds in my grill and they flawless
Molly in a pill got me rolling
Heard I signed a deal and they calling
Privacy with your dog and now she barking
Shawty taking that dick oh yeah she barking
Shawty doing her thing before the barking
Imma take her to the moon like a martian
Don't you dare go tripping about this bitch, she's just a bitch
When I got my digits I went tricking out with bitches
I was in that tootsie in Miami getting quilted
I was in that tootsie down in Miami getting gifted
Yeah yeah
Go to the top all the way to the back to the right got Shaq name on a Rollie
Me and Roscoe and OJ made a film movie
OJ hoe totally had a movie
Me and Roscoe and OJ got her groovy
(Sorry Shaq haha know what i'm saying we'll get that cleaned though jack you understand that huh)

[Chorus]
Get away
Could you please get the fuck away you mistreat me
Get off me
Cottage cheese dry cheese no poultry
Get em' off of me (back em' up)
Not today not another day bae get em' off of me
Back, back, back it up, back, back, back it
Back up all the way

[Outro]
