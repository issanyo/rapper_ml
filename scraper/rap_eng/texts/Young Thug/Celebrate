[Intro]
Celebrate! Celebrate!
I wanna, celebrate
Ay, celebrate!

[Hook: Young Thug]
Zoes let that nigga run up on him twice
It had to be like 99
I'm waiting on all these rap niggas to cross the line
Imma pull up and put that stick right on they spine
These pussy niggas hating they really want my -
I'm never contemplating on my boys
I spent a couple milli on these toys
I'm beating it down they shoulda locked the doors

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I swear shawty bouncing on my dick, she like to twirl on it
Anything she want she can get it, put the world on it
I was growing up I wanted to be just like the carter
Politician, 'breviation, communication, humiliation left me with a scar on me
Imma pick em up and then drop em right on the ground, aye
Shoutout to them niggas that's pulling up right on time, not late
I just tell em one time, ain't no nigga go
We don't ever have style, let that .44 blow
Pull up pull up to your block, nigga stop shop
Shooting at everybody, riding up with lil brah
It ain't ever to late..

[Verse 2: Louis B]
So many opposition, think I prolly need a pole on me
Feel like ever since I lost smiles I got no homies
Now can I get an Amen, now can I get a witness?
Yeah you know I'm balling like 04 pistons
The grill up on my rim look like it's blowing kisses
A lot of y'all too fake, I think you need to see a dentist, no way
They say they love me but it's my chedder
It ain't working out then I won't sweat her
We in the W and I ain't talking jetta
I'm gon' need some floaters just in case she get wetter
Andale mama benaki give me pesos
When I'm done you know it's back to the pesos
You know I got the valet by the caseloads
You can catch me riding in some white G-fazos
