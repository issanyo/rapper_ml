[Verse 1: MoneyBagg Yo]
Crack the seal it's potent, you can smell when it's medical
I doubled the cup to let you know I ain't drinkin' nothin' regular
I keep a couple shots in case you get foul and technical
I'm free as a bird but somehow I'm still goin' federal
Yeah, come take a ride with me, hop on the passenger side
Baby let's burn some trees, top back while we glide
I'ma get fly like Clyde, diamonds like stars and skies
You gotta accept that I'm live, yeah

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
Pour up a zip of that fluid, and I know you don't do it
But baby get high with me, draw me under the influence
I used to walk home, now I be gone, 'cause I be touring
Water on me, and on my feet, I'm on the shores
Pour up a zip of that fluid, and I know you don't do it
But baby get high with me, draw me under the influence
I used to walk home, now I be gone, 'cause I be touring
Water on me, and on my feet, I'm on the shores

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Yeah, back in the day I was plain, yeah
Now I get fly as a plane, yeah
Soon as I take the diamonds out of my mouth I'ma put 'em inside of a ring
You got niggas 'round you tryna get clout instead of chasing money, Hussein
Yeah the turtleneck Tom Ford and you still see hits from the chain
Travel on me wet, look like I'm standing in the rain
2018 Phantom Rolls, stars in the ceiling
I ain't look at the forecast, so I hopped in the Rolls in case that it rain
You ain't gon' do it, I came out the mud, I drank on mud
My diamonds brown, I got on mud, I fucked you good
She nut I know it, I lie like rugs, these hollows fudge
Every day, we purge and grudge, shake it up and pour up suds

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
Pour up a zip of that fluid, and I know you don't do it
But baby get high with me, draw me under the influence
I used to walk home, now I be gone, 'cause I be touring
Water on me, and on my feet, I'm on the shores
Pour up a zip of that fluid, and I know you don't do it
But baby get high with me, draw me under the influence
I used to walk home, now I be gone, 'cause I be touring
Water on me, and on my feet, I'm on the shores

[Verse 3: MoneyBagg Yo]
I'm rocking ice like meth (drugs)
I got codeine on my breath
I waste some on myself (damn)
Thirty I'm aiming like Steph (bah)
She like my persona, Dolce Gabanna, D&G belt
I'm a playboy, bunnies all on me, I'm feeling like Hef
My dogs gon' slide for me, they gon' pull a homicide for me
I like an honest freak, told the bitch to never lie to me
I'm a star like 'Lito, once I found out that boosted my ego
I'm in the jungle but not in the hood, I'm somewhere in Rio
Come in and live fly with me, fly like a redeye with me
I took her through some shit, watchin' powder, shawty tired of me
A33's all inside of me
Pop a couple, come and vibe with me
Took a jet to get some privacy
Campaign in the sky with me

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
Pour up a zip of that fluid, and I know you don't do it
But baby get high with me, draw me under the influence
I used to walk home, now I be gone, 'cause I be touring
Water on me, and on my feet, I'm on the shores
Pour up a zip of that fluid, and I know you don't do it
But baby get high with me, draw me under the influence
I used to walk home, now I be gone, 'cause I be touring
Water on me, and on my feet, I'm on the shores
