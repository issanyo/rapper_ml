[Verse: Young Thug]
It's another [?]
Talking brazy and I thought
I ain't trying [?] I'm tryna [?]
On me
You know I just had a hundred thousand keys, saran on me
[?]
I tried to take, rings and the necklace
Said I'm taking full advantage never stressing
Cause I had feelings for this girl [?]
But promise it's nothing bout that money nigga
I meant to tell you since a kid I was getting my own [?]
I was bringing in the racks and she was steady shopping
Big bills, all colors, Nicki Minajing
I ain't tripping bitch
Since a kid I been a dresser, thousand island
See my diamonds green, piss porta potty woah

[Verse: Mac Miller]
While I'm sleeping
Swimming in the living room like the deep end
All I ever needed was a alibi (yeah yeah)
