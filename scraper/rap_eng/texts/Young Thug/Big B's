Handful of hundreds, real big Bentley
Hublot, nigga get some business
Whole lotta hoes, nigga get your women, heh
Stuff 'er with the pole, come and get your women nigga
Big business, talk shit Wendy Williams, ooh
Catch 'em at the club sipping, fuck around they missing, hold on (swoop), hold on
Big pimping, iced out my crew now my mission complete
Pimp C, I ain't doing that, I'ma fuck her on the sheets, yeah
And all my niggas loyal like Bun B, hold on
Fuck you thought? YSL till we d-i-e, hold on, hold on, hol' on
Fuck around and set the bitch off like Queen Latifah
Hold on, hold on, yeah, going all out 'bout my dog like Scooby-ee
And a nigga trap door swinging like busy bee, woah (Busy bee)
Outdated temporary tag on a Bentley B (Bentley B)
Two tone wire bag, double R, park it on the streets, yeah, hold on
Two tone wire bag, big tires tear up the streets, rwar
Looking at your kid, I might be the papi (sheesh)
65 pointers in the Cuban sheesh (damn, woah, sheesh)
Diamonds on the backside tearing up my skin, sheesh
Uh, your old man tryna do it like me, sheesh

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Please, please
Treat me like you know who I am

Bitch I know who I am, uh

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
I got money on my card
Put some money on they books, that's a yard
I declare war on the beast for my God, sheesh
Gross 3 mil' off the new hat
If I could go back, I'd make a two cap
Love me in my city like Cusack
Get a little beat and I'll loop that
Get a little money, I'll oop that
Split it with my niggas in the group chat
Left for a minute then I flew back
Had to ask Bruce "where the truth at?"
Had to ask Rahm "where the truth at?"
Now I can't ride with the roof back
Tell 'em I don't play around with other people's kids
Got an office in the steakhouse
Gotta bid for the ribs
Got a meeting at the Ritz
Gave a crib to my rib
'Cause she leaving where I live but I see her in a min
Got a Michael prayer card for the good luck, ay
Bra push up when I pull up, ay
Got a little money from the tour, yeah
Spend it all on baby pull ups, ay
Big old Bentley, bitch I mix the Henny with the Simply
Lemonade exterior, Lorenzos under Bentleys
Put you in the friend zone if you start acting too friendly
Bought a baby Benzo and some Kenzo just for Kensli
Wake up real early but I eat late
Go and hit the streets with that briefcase
Time to shake down another cheap skate
You could tell he's lying, cheesecake

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Make a nigga bitch tap out
Then put 24â€™s on a real big body
Bitch said nigga need to stop got 100 racks on me
Can't fit in my pocket
I'm a street nigga, I'ma eat me some soup, I'ma let my bitch eat pasta
Told y'all niggas ain't stopping
Black card in my wallet, I'ma feed my partner
I was at one of my shows feeling like Cam'ron with the pink Margielas
We was tryna beat a murder capital, riding around the town with the pink Beretta
When I got in touch with the money, me and shawty fucked around and filled my schedule
Momma just sent me a picture got Indian in my family through my God damn nana
Young nigga fucked 'round, dropped out school, learned it all through the ID channel
Young nigga fucked around and ran out of bullets in the .40, got to get a banana
These young niggas go brazy, done got that money, they still might pop
So many blue faces on me right now, young nigga still gamble
35 racks for the factories, I steal mammals
I ain't no rapper nigga, I geolog'
I'm a big dog, no pedigree, I eat racks
Boomerang your bitch sweet, she coming back

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Please, please
Treat me like you know who I am
Please, please
Bitch I know who I am, uh
