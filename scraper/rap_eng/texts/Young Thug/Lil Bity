[Pre-Chorus]
Fuck all that bullshit, I'm on that bullshit man I'm bout to come down from the top
I saw some dope and I rob me some Yays the Thugger came straight from the block
I print it out with my nigga DK and we slept on the sofa and couch
Yeah we gang members and fuck the police, we got sticks and they runnin' with us

[Chorus]
You lil bity bitch, you lil bity bitch you
You lil bity bitch, you lil bity bitch you
You lil bity bitch , you lil bity bitch you
You lil bity bitch, you lil bity bitch you

[Verse 1]
When I was in school, my uncle copped me a tool (pussy)
No Winnie the Pooh, ready to dunk on you and your crew (rrr)
I get some bags of cash, I'm talkin' uh pass the gas
Your sister want dick from the back
I tuck it and wear my hat
That baby don't know no better
She only gon do what you tell her
My diamonds they wet, umbrella
Get money and and filled up my schedule
I can't change like a channel
Leave his brains on the ceiling
And I can't disguise the bezel
He plan out I bring out the felons
She rub my neck in the percocet
The molly cops yeah she pop that
The way I'm drippin' got her draws wet
The Miley Cyrus got her sauce wet
I came in Beverly she caught that
I lease it better not tryna stop that
No police got the bitch
[?]

[Pre-Chorus]
Fuck all that bullshit, I'm on that bullshit man I'm bout to come down from the top

[Chorus]
You lil bity bitch, you lil bity bitch you
You lil bity bitch, you lil bity bitch you

You lil bity bitch, you lil bity bitch you

[Verse 2]
Man down, it's a man down
I make a sound, make a damn sound
I'm smoking bags outta big ol' pounds
These bitches know me by the cash count
I pull it out then I'ma spazz out
Fuck around and bring a bag out
Fuck around and bring some cash out
I maybe need to bring it last time
And tell me what you just said now?
And tell me how the fuck you playing now?
I pull it out and I'ma spray it now
You still think that that's some cash now, huh?
You still think that that's some cash now? huh, huh huh, haa
I know you don't, watch me kick shit like a punk
Shout out DuLu, y'all free that nigga Unfunk
You said that you did, we know that you don't
You said that you will, we all know that you won't

[Pre-Chorus]
Fuck all that bullshit, I'm on that bullshit man I'm bout to come down from the top
I saw some dope and I rob me some yays the Thugger came straight from the block

[Chorus]
You lil bity bitch, you lil bity bitch you
You lil bity bitch, you lil bity bitch you
You lil bity bitch, you lil bity bitch you
You lil bity bitch, you lil bity bitch you
