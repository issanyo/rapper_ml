[Intro]
Yeah, I got you boo
Together forever, man any problem that you got, bitch I got it too
Together forever, man any problem that you got, bitch I got it too
Wheezy beats

[Chorus]
I'll cock it back, I'm ready to fire that chrome, hey
I was out the country, ain't know what time I'm on (different time zones)
I was tryna get the devil out of my charms
I was thankin' God, I was thankin' Allah I'm on
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe (just to be safe)
Just to be safe, dawg (just to be safe, dawg)
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe, dawg
Gotta make it home

[Verse 1]
Hop out the Bent and into the coupe
Fuzz hit my family, they switchin' it up
It ain't nothin' I could do (nothin' I could do)
My dresser full of diamonds
I ride with that wooly, I pour my own juice
Just in case a nigga look on me, and try run up on me
I'ma fuck with the cougars
Elliantte gon' flood me, man fuck it I'm stuntin' on you
I hope you lay down and remember that I was just gunnin' for you (fool)
They told me that I was gon' end up like MC Hammer
Cause everything I get, I try to invest it in you
You too and you too
In the daytime a nigga havin' nightmares
I wonder if he answerin' every one of my prayers
Hate to say it but I go broke 'bout anyone of my peers
You ain't gon' never change this shit
Yea, I'm bustin' down, yeah
Every single mothafucker 'round me rich, we just gon' bust down, bust down
Ain't gon' get no second chance, you crossed me
I don't give a fuck about you
Yea, I'ma give up on you
Yea, I'ma hit the clutch 'bout you (skrt)
I'ma throw it up by ya, yea, you better have luck by ya
Can't nobody ever beat the triple cross
I got snake in my veins, snake in my drawls
I got snake on my attire, snake inside my wounds
I put snakes around your eyes and, man, you gon' move

[Chorus]
I'll cock it back, I'm ready to fire that chrome, hey
I was out the country, ain't know what time I'm on
I was tryna get the devil out of my charms
I was thankin' God, I was thankin' Allah I'm on
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe (I spend more money)
Just to be safe, dawg
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe, dawg (just to be safe)
Gotta make it home

[Verse 2]
And I just wanna make it back to my kiddies
And I just wanna sit back and count these digits
Don't plan on lettin' nobody take their place
I pay more money to security than I make
And it's crazy but it's safe
I get to run around in peace everyday
I know my niggas go monkey like Bathing Ape
I tried to tell you, but you had to learn late
I was just holdin' you down and you didn't stay down like you 'posed to
I had you rollin' around in that Bentley Mulsanne and the Rolls too
I had you glossin' on all of these bitches just like you was 'posed to
I got you latest Chanel, and the latest Fendi, and the Gucci too
I told you, I love you forever
I'm never gon' change, I'm not stoppin', boo
I told you, I was gonna keep your lil' bank account full
And your pocket too
I start at your ear, I'ma lick it, then fuck around and end at the bottom, boo
Together forever, man
Any problem that you got, bitch, I got it too

[Chorus]
I'll cock it back, I'm ready to fire that chrome, hey
I was out the country, ain't know what time I'm on (different time zones)
I was tryna get the devil out of my charms
I was thankin' God, I was thankin' Allah I'm on
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe (just to be safe)
Just to be safe, dawg (just to be safe, dawg)
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe, dawg
Gotta make it home
