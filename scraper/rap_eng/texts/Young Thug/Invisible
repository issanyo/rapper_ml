[Intro: Shad da God]
Run that back Turbo
Yeah you just gotta get gone, you know what I'm sayin'
Yeah a motherfucker can't see us, haha
Playmakers
Go

[Chorus: Shad da God & Young Thug]
Invisible, diamonds set invisible (invisible)
Stack that shit up 'til you get invisible (you gotta stack it)
Gotta run that shit up like that shit a ritual (you gotta stack it)
Make it fast, I get the bankroll like it's biblical (they gotta stack it)
Get it clap, get to singin' and get musical (I got a voice, yeah)
On the block and it's beatin' just like Frooty Loops (I got it beatin')
Invisible, that V12 get invisible (and I get gone)
Pour that lean up in the coupe like it's the living room (I'm on the lean)

[Verse 1: Shad da God & Young Thug]
Bad Instagram bitch, just a fiend (say that's just a fiend)
Thirty for that whole thing there that's ketamine (that's that whole thing)
Quarterback the whole agenda that's that diamond ring (that's that diamond ring)
I'm just ridin' round like lil' bruh, I got on like three rings (I got on like three rings)
I put Jimmy's on my bitch, she like to fuck up the scene (she like to fuck up the scene)
I just changed my oil bitch, I pull up with quarts of lean (I pull up with drank bitch)
All these drugs, digi-scales need to endorse me (need to endorse me)
Small minded shit don't do nothin', it just force me

[Chorus: Shad da God & Young Thug]
Invisible, diamonds set invisible (invisible)
Stack that shit up 'til you get invisible (you gotta stack it)
Gotta run that shit up like that shit a ritual (you gotta stack it)
Make it fast, I get the bankroll like it's biblical (they gotta stack it)
Get it clap, get to singin' and get musical (I got a voice, yeah)
On the block and it's beatin' just like Frooty Loops (I got it beatin')
Invisible, that V12 get invisible (and I get gone)
Pour that lean up in the coupe like it's the living room (I'm on the lean)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
My bitch fly as fuck, she need a witch broom (yeah, yeah)
Call 911, bruh I took too many shrooms (yeah, yeah)
I had been high for 20 years when I was 22 (yeah, yeah)
I bought Chanel for all her tears and now she bulletproof (fast bitch)
Bread manager, make on a bobsled (skrrt)
We don't let bargains be bargains (yeah, panic, no panic)
The bitch ain't bad, you know we swervin' (urr)
Bentley Bentayga, pitch the curve in (the cabbage slabbin')

[Chorus: Shad da God & Young Thug]
Invisible, diamonds set invisible (invisible)
Stack that shit up 'til you get invisible (you gotta stack it)
Gotta run that shit up like that shit a ritual (you gotta stack it)
Make it fast, I get the bankroll like it's biblical (they gotta stack it)
Get it clap, get to singin' and get musical (I got a voice, yeah)
On the block and it's beatin' just like Frooty Loops (I got it beatin')
Invisible, that V12 get invisible (and I get gone)
Pour that lean up in the coupe like it's the living room (I'm on the lean)

[Outro: Young Thug]
