[Intro: Young Thug]
MPA, what up?
It's Thugga, Thugga baby
Got my whole crew behind me

[Hook: Young Thug]
I want you to say, say
RIP to my big dawgs lets pray
Me falling off any time soon? No way
Im ballin' for a lifetime and a day
And I get money, that shit run in my family
Let them goons get on your head, yea they from Los Angeles
Anything I ask them to do, do believe they handle it
I got one question just answer it
Who’s on top?

[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
And I’m sitting back thinking of a master plan
Trap going crazy, we smoking shit from Amsterdam
I been doing this for a very long time now
The only option is climbing up, ain’t no falling down
And I been a Young Thug, and I'mma get wicked bout that paper
Momma always told me to shit on all haters
VVS ones or you can call 'em glaciers
Comin' to get they cash, this ain't the movie Takers
See me and (?), see me and (?), I could shoot the work
I don't need no shooter with me cause I'm shooting first
I'm such a boss, somewhere eating a healthy meal
Runnin' in and out the marina, we in Beverly Hills

[Hook: Young Thug]
I want you to say, say
RIP to my big dawgs lets pray
Me falling off any time soon? No way
Im ballin' for a lifetime and a day
And I get money, that shit run in my family
Let them goons get on your head, yea they from Los Angeles
Anything I ask them to do, do believe they handle it
I got one question just answer it
Who’s on top?

[Verse 2: Wicced]
They got me thinkin' like Einstein with the number
I got a money vision, all I see is commas
I want the sleep dreaming, going down the money tunnel
Dreams come to reality, don't you wake me for nothin'
I'm livin' out my dream, everyday countin' money
Rental car traffic traffickin', movin' strong packages
I stay strapped so the kid move rapidly
Ain't shit sweet, let the iron fill his cavity
Goons on go, and they kill for the passionate
Bitch I got a money high, I think I lost gravity
And it ain't shit you can tell me
Money runnin' out the ass, you can smell me

[Hook: Young Thug]
I want you to say, say
RIP to my big dawgs lets pray
Me falling off any time soon? No way
Im ballin' for a lifetime and a day
And I get money, that shit run in my family
Let them goons get on your head, yea they from Los Angeles
Anything I ask them to do, do believe they handle it
I got one question just answer it
Who’s on top?

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Oh, who's on top?
Everyone's on top, so let's see who flopped
Yea, this a wonderful life
My goons'll kill a nigga for such a wonderful price
My weed smell like poop rocks
My blunts are extra fat like a tree top
I say, I smoke weed until I pass out
Haiti Slang's the reason why you bitch got her ass out
I know Haitians that'll take over the city
Make big dogs feel like midgets
Chickens, my J.R. no crickets
You wanna get it? I'll eat you alive

[Hook: Young Thug]
