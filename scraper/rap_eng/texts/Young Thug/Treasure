How the hell that nigga leave the treasure?
How the hell that nigga leave the treasure?
How the hell that nigga leave the treasure, nigga?
How the hell that nigga leave the treasure, nigga?
How the hell that nigga leave the treasure, nigga? Aye!

[Verse 1]
Niggas tryna say it ain't lit up(Shut up!)
You ain't have any stones in your bezels (No way..)
Burn his ass up like a sweater
Have a nigga leaving on the stretcher
Pussy nigga know ain't no limit
If you tryna get it gotta spend it
YSL counting plenty digits
Migo graduated from the midgets (Slime!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm a rolling stone nigga never going home till' the ball gone
How the hell that nigga leave the treasure when the treasure bring the bezels
And the bezels worth a foreign homes? (Chee!)
Who the hell are you?
You gon play with any nigga in my brew and I'ma shoot until his arm gone
Thugga Thugga living that life like Pimp C
Got a fucking 4 poured up in this styrofoam
Lean, lean lean lean Thug a fiend
Young nigga running around with thousands in his jeans
Racks in a rental, bricks inside the fender
Heading down the road getting trailed by lieutenants
Nigga gettin' real serve him gateway
Nigga give no wraps up, yay yay
Holla at them last like feng shui
Thugger taking off for the runway (sheesh!)
I ain't Rick Ross but I love gunplay
You can cut it off but I pull up anyway
When I feed her face told me hit him in the face
YSL clearing out the whole little place
Make a pussy nigga turn Christian like Ma$e
Gold bottles, Ace of Spades, looking like a vase
I ain't talking dozens but I'm gonna beat the case
I ain't talking shoes but my blunts are laced, you dig me?

[Hook]
How the hell that nigga leave the treasure?
How the hell that nigga leave the treasure?
How the hell that nigga leave the treasure, nigga?
How the hell that nigga leave the treasure, nigga?
How the hell that nigga leave the treasure, nigga? Aye!

[Verse 3: Zuse]
Rifle come from Cuba, all dem' a tote, dem' my shooters
Clip longer than a ruler, extendo' pon' the Ruger
Aim for your bloodclot medulla, shoot ya out of your pumas
Chicken I know you a rooster, molly mi take fi a booster
Tech nine come with the cooler, ice these niggas like a jeweler
Poy poy poy pon' a puta, bite him like barracuda
Always run to the mula, smoke you like you a hookah
Blow you away, bazooka, dip, dip, dip, like a scuba
Teaching these niggas like tutors, tell them no rumor
Hooping these niggas like hulas
Fire like Judah, never sell out like Judas, put that one on nigga
Bullet, bullet, bullet, hey, hey, hey, ride by scooter
I never leave the treasure I'm the scoopa

[Verse 1]
Niggas tryna say it ain't lit up(Shut up!)
You ain't have any stones in your bezels (No way..)
Burn his ass up like a sweater
Have a nigga leaving on the stretcher
Pussy nigga know ain't no limit
If you tryna get it gotta spend it
YSL counting plenty digits
Migo graduated from the midgets (Slime!)
