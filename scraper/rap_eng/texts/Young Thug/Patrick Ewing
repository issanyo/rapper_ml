[Chorus]
Excuse me, Patrick Ewing
All white with a bubblegum bottle, ayy
Wheezy Beats
I'm pursuing, I won't ever ruin, ruin
Oh, baby, I won't

[Verse 1]
Okay, my house is oversized, I kicked my bitch out in my drive (yuh)
My house is oversized, I done kicked my bitch out in my drive (goodbye)
My house is oversized, I done kicked my bitch out in my drive
My house is oversized, I done kicked myâ€”
Ay, let's get it
Stop it (stop it), drop it and roll it (roll it)
Fire drill, fire drill
I'm on a pill, it's a fire drill
Stop, drop, and roll it (and what?)
I cop a new Rollie (Rollie)
Fire drill, I'm off a pill and the double seal, bitch it's a fire drill
I got so much ice on my wrist, it can't be no fire (yeah)
I put it out with my watch 'cause it's wet like fire hydrants (yeah)
I got a bad bitch and she told me she dyking (yeah)
I nutted, then I told her wrap that shit up like a cypher (hee, hee)
I brought them black diamonds, that black ice like ninjas (woo)
I suck on that pussy then I tell her suck on that Kenwood

[Chorus]
Excuse me, Patrick Ewing
All white with a bubblegum bottle, ayy
I'm pursuing, I won't ever ruin, ruin
Oh, baby, I won't call 'em

[Verse 2]
Tag team and jump me in
She perform a sloppy [?]
I told her to stop with this (stop it)
'Rarris without a tint (skrrt)
She slurp it right on her chin
I pray that she do it again
Now, now, right, I pray that she do it again
Now (yeah), right, right (yeah, yeah), I hope that she do it again
Right, now, now, I hope she perform again
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Damn your problem, fuck your momma like your fuckin' father
Big llama, tree stomper, need a female condom
Suck up top to the bottom, Antarctica-ca
I'ma pop a wheelie, cop 'em, then tear up the bottle

[Chorus]
Excuse me, Patrick Ewing
All white with a bubblegum bottle, ayy
I'm pursuing, I won't ever ruin, ruin
Oh, baby, I won't call 'em

[Verse 3]
I jump in that pussy like jumpin' jacks
I saw my old bitch, now she want me back
I don't got nothin' for you, bitch, callin' racks
I smoke loud in the jet, that's a Thundercat
They thought I was doin' bad 'til they noticed that
I didn't need 'em for jack and they noticed that
I walked in with some cash and I throw them racks
Honeymoon, kiss on the table
Hoe, no candy, but I see you later
And my ring is so big like equators
All I want is acre, fuck a neighbor
If you silent, nigga, tell them nothing
That my jeans are ice cream, so I cake her
Promise to [?], no hater
Brand new Irvings an' they Suaders

[Chorus]
Excuse me, Patrick Ewing
All white with a bubblegum bottle, ayy
I'm pursuing, I won't ever ruin, ruin
Oh, baby, I won't call 'em
Oh, baby, I won't call 'em
Oh, baby, I won't call 'em
