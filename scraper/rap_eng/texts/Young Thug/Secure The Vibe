[Chorus: Gunna]
Secure that vibe at all times
Forgot that bitch, got Alzheimer's
Got white, got blue, got black diamonds
Go cash out nigga, I'm a big timer

[Verse 1: Gunna]
I done woke up and brought that bag out
Why the fuck my bitch want twenty-five hundred for a ass shot?
If you turn, turn around, got diamonds on her fingers and her hand now
I pulled straight up to the doctor, nigga I cashed out
Gotta keep my cool, stay cautious, I got fans now
You niggas trying hard to fit in, nigga watch me stand out
I had to take a sip of the lean just to wash my xan down
If I pull up with that chopper it's a man down
These bitches want vibes
New coupe, frog eyes
We ain't telling no lies
He ain't selling no pies
V12 when I ride
Yeah see twelve when I slide
Yeah got M's on my mind
Might put this jet in the sky

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Secure that vibe at all times
Forgot that bitch, got Alzheimer's
Got blue, got white, got black diamonds (I got red too)
I'ma cash out nigga, I'm a big timer

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'ma pass that ho like Matt Ryan
I'ma put that bitch like Mac timer
I'ma grease that bitch, yeah hands down
I'ma wrestle that ho like Mankind
Young nigga drippin' that sauce and we the bad guys
I can get a nigga knocked off, I secured the mob ties
Motherfuck the GBI, yeah fuck the FBI (fuck 'em all)
Five hundred thousand on shoes, yeah I got every kind
Diamonds they hittin' the finger, these bitches gon' recognize
Whippin' it like it deserve it, brick everything dime to dimes
Martin and Gina this week, man I'm chillin' around with my wife
You play with the slime, you play with this money
We play with your life

[Chorus: Gunna]
Secure that vibe at all times
Forgot that bitch, got Alzheimer's
Got white, got blue, got black diamonds
Go cash out nigga, I'm a big timer

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Secure that vibe at all times
Forgot that bitch, got Alzheimer's
Got blue, got white, got black diamonds (I got red too)
I'ma cash out nigga, I'm a big timer
