Married to this game, don't even know it love me
Got a bad bitch with me and she say she from the Philippines
I'm just a young nigga livin' like back then it was a dream
And the goal is to stay down and get money with your team

[Post-Hook: MPA Duke]
Better get your mind right
Better get your money right
Better get your money right
And go and get a sack
Better get your money right
Better get your money right
Better get your money right
And go and get a sack
Better get your money right
Better get your money right
Better get your money right
Take a lose, but ya get it all right back
Better get your money right
Better get your money right
Better get your money right
And go and get a sack

[Verse 1: MPA Duke]
Nigga stay focused and go and get a sack
I can see it in your eye, lil' nigga you ain't want it
Better stay tip toe down nigga flat
Nigga see it in your eye if you ain't want no money
Gotta keep it on you even in the church
Cause you niggas out here in the streets
Man you niggas really phony
Niggas running from the cops since I was a youngin'
I was standin' on the corner tryna get some money
Pocket lookin' like a phonebook, your's thinner than a page
Tryna get money in all different states
Showin' all my fashion and performin' on the stage
I ain't ever had shit, I know why these niggas hate
Hate all you want I'm countin' it up
Fuckin' these bitches and passin' 'em up
We pourin' it up and we take all the nuts
My wrist below zero, call it Alaska
You niggas is plottin', I know that they hatin'
They bitches be watching every move that we makin'
From city to city, my name holdin' weight
My plate is soo full like I got racks on my plate
Gotta stay focused and stay out these niggas way
Never aimin' low or aimin' at nigga's face
Keep it in my hand fuck nigga, not on my waist
Payin' for a body, no face, no case

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Niggas better have they mind right when runnin' to the paper
Nigga bet I hit them bitches and pass 'em around like potatoes
Swear to god I'm having muthafuckin' bread just like a bagel
Crip blue good rod just for my neighbors
We never sing to 'em, you could T-Pain us
Yeah, but I would put it in your anus
Yeah, beat it up like David Banner
I'm with my girl, I like how you a stranger
She wanna do some strange things
Ever since I've been around, she wanna change things
I can't change a thing and she understood it
So she remained my main
I bang red like a fire flame
I'm a stand up guy like she called my name
Yeah, give me a lil something
Everything around me gon' gang bang

[Bridge: MPA Duke]
You gotta stay focused
You gotta stay focused
You gotta stay focused
You gotta stay focused
