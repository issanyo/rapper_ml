And them boys in Atlanta they don’t play yeah
And them boys from Atlanta tote them K's yeah
And them boys from Atlanta got bananas for these monkeys nigga

[Verse 1]
I got bands in the bando and I'm beating David Banner

Motor runnin', spent them commas, now it's thunder
Count a hundred want a hundred more, that's hunger

All my diamonds come in yellow like a Funyun

I'm chasing dreams, free Meek Milly

Wait, let me pick up his remains
Hey, them gators get their prey
Hold up, hold up, wait
