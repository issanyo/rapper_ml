[Hook: DeJ Loaf]
That's my shawty
I like what you be doin' with your body
Can't nobody get this pussy wet, yo
And can't nobody fuck me like you can, yo, you can, yo
That's my shawty
I like what you be doin' with your body
Can't nobody get this pussy wet, yo
And can't nobody fuck me like you can, yo

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I just might beat the pussy, rock it
I just might eat the pussy, sock it
I'ma hurry up, Thug Mr. Miyagi
Pussy get wet when I go Miley Cyrus
All my jewelry water like a fuckin' fire hydrant
When shawty get on top it looks like hydraulics
And when I nut I leave a milked body
And these hoes straight out of Follie's
That pussy Batman, but my dick is Robin
Might catch me blowin' in it like a cartridge
You can do him, bitch he the same as me
I'm not gon' cuff her like the damn police
69 is the only time that you ain't a dime
When it's time I fold your ass up like a pork rind
Girl sit down, now she done jumped up off the porch now
I done planted a nigga crosses like the Lord now

[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
Stretch that pussy out like it's pilates
The way that I be ridin' like I called shotty
He fuck me like he straight up out the can yo
He push it in so deep, I be like, "Damn, yo"
More than 15 seconds, put it on the Gram
We go so ham
Solid nigga make solid moves, tie me up, that's that solitude
Bend it over, let you bottom bang
Eat me up, that's that badaboom
And that's my baby
You drive me crazy
Yeah that's my baby
Yeah why you drive me crazy?
That's my baby, why you drive me crazy?
You my baby, you drive me crazy

[Hook: DeJ Loaf]
That's my shawty
I like what you be doin' with your body
Can't nobody get this pussy wet, yo
And can't nobody fuck me like you can, yo, you can, yo
That's my shawty
I like what you be doin' with your body
Can't nobody get this pussy wet, yo
And can't nobody fuck me like you can, yo
