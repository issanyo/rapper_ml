[Sample:]
I can't keep up, I can’t keep up
If someone ever showed me love won't somebody give a fuck?

[Hook:]
Fuck I just can't keep up
And it’s cause I love you both
Hey, and don't you ever ever think about treating me the worst way cause I love you both, hey
I'm still running round this bitch thuggin
I'm still running round this bitch belly
I'm still running round this bitch bussin'
Can't believe I ain't gave it up yet
We gon’ leave a nigga head on a dick
We gon’ leave a nigga neck on his chest
Found myself saying fuck a nigga vest
Can't believe, can’t believe I ain't gave it up yet

[Verse 1:]
For this cash, ain't no difference, bet
On his head like a Mitchell and Ness
Went to bed with the bitch then she text
Yeah this cash make her different
BACK ON BACK WITH THE BACH
Get a plain Honda civic lil bitch
The fuck is you doing with the cash?
Gon' end up missing, bitch
Swear, we letting out sticks in your car, udigg?
We spazz on your ass like you down with the law
Pull up the Bentley, then chop up your whole little bitty boy
Pull up your stacks, I got more money than and your whole little squad
Torture them babies, do em the worst way
Keep acting crazy, do em, no heresy
I make them chickens go lay an egg, I need some rackades
I stack up some green like Saint Patrick’s day

[Hook:]
Imma try but I can't keep up
Hey! I care for you both
So don't you ever ever think about treating me the worst way
Cause I love you both, hey
Still in the streets thuggin, yeah

I'm still in the streets dirty, yeah
Can't believe it, can't believe I ain't gave it up yet

[Verse 2:]
Can't believe it, still can't believe it
If you play, I want your hand that you roll with, better yet your feet, yeah
Nigga playing with a G, make a whole lotta G's and achieve, yeah
In the VIP with your bitch and a whole lotta freaks sucking dick, yeah
Nigga playing with my man, pop his trunk, get the blam, make him eat that
Nigga tripping, got 2 cuban links with a Jeffery on a V-neck
That's some real drip nigga heat that up, eat that and defeat that
Better have you a kid cause you can't keep me in check
Boy you can't keep up

[Bridge:]
Show me love won't somebody give a fuck?
Because I can't keep up
I can't keep up
Don't you ever try to mistreat me baby do me wrong
Don't you ever do that to the Thugger
Because I love you both

[Outro:]
Still in the streets thuggin, thuggin, thuggin, yeah
Still in the streets nigga bussin, bussin, bussin, yeah
Still in the streets nigga dirty, dirty, dirty, yeah
Still in the streets drinking dirty, dirty, dirty, yeah
