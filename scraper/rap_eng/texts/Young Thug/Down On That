[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]
Re, re, re, remix
I know a rich nigga with them bricks in Zone 6
Ain't no way in hell they gon' catch up for my whole clique
I buy all the verse, I bust 'em down, and I remix
Thugger, Thugger, make a nigga bitch say it

[Hook: Young Thug]
Down on that, down on that, get down on that
Down on that, down on that, get down on that
Down on that, down on that

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Alka-Seltzer plus of junkies
I don't mean to brag but I could purchase Kremlin
Bitch I got a tummy, not my fuckin' stomach
Bitch I drink that lean until I'm fuckin' vomit
I got a closet full of Armani
I just copped a foreign ho, I think she's from London
You know I'm gonna eat her yeah, she's my fuckin' lunchs
I'm on molly and lean, I'mma have lil momma runnin'
I'mma catch it and beat it, now she leanin' on me
I'm super cray if I catch a bitch cheatin' on me
I love the the money dirt free and licks and shit shit
Too many racks spent for you to be bleachin' shit

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got the money in the bed with me
A money counter on my dresser
I thank God money there for me
I hope we always be together
A nigga told me he was scared for me
I told him, "Get your shit together"
I walk around with big hands on me
I went to sleep with the bread on me
I get money every day of the week
You know it's dog on dog, these niggas'll kill the dog to eat
I got that .44 bulldog on me and I blast for free
I got them young niggas who'll kill you for an ounce of weed
