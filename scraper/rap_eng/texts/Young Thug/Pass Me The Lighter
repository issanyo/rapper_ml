[Chorus]
Pass me that lighter, I'm in dis bih' wid a well known supplier
I wan' be just like Michael, yeah, Mike Myers
Your boyfriend cannot see me like a sniper
I get my kush and dopey off a boat
I swear to God, you hit my kush, you choke
My pockets look like bookies like I spoke
Catch your bitch and I make her sing a note
Start at the bottom, went straight to the top
Stop at the middle and pick up a knot
Proceed to the top cause nigga you hot
I might give dis bih' whatever I got

[Hook]
Yeah mon, set up a shop
Yeah mon, roll and I stop
Hey man, president watch
Hey mon, Ralph Lauren socks
Yeah mon!

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Skeet off a rollie, I pull up on bae
Mama ass so big she taking up space, that shit in the way
All of my diamonds they wet, I feel I got 'em out the sea
Pull up on shorty you know that I'm kicking the shit like Spike Lee
I know all about you, I know where you be
Break em' somethin' off proper, If you wan' play with me
Where was y'all fuck nigga when I was screamin' out "help me out!"
Tryin' to take some now boy, you gon' hear a bow
Leave you dead on the couch with one in yo' mouth
Put 50,000 on your head like a spouse
Aye, won't have me when my dick go "Pow! Wow!"
And I done poured a fo' of that Act', then I rolled me a blunt from that

[Chorus]
Pass me that lighter, I'm in dis bih' wid a well known supplier
I wan' be just like Michael, yeah, Mike Myers
Your boyfriend cannot see me like a sniper
I get my kush and dopey off a boat
I swear to God, you hit my kush, you choke
My pockets look like bookies like I spoke
Catch your bitch and I make her sing a note
Start at the bottom, went straight to the top
Stop at the middle and pick up a knot
Proceed to the top cause nigga you hot
I might give dis bih' whatever I got

[Hook]
Yeah mon, set up a shop
Yeah mon, roll and I stop
Hey man, president watch
Hey mon, Ralph Lauren socks
Yeah mon!

[Verse 2: MPA Duke]
Pass me the lighter, I'm packing the fire
Don't fuck with no liars, Michelin all on my tires
I'm moving the chickens - Mike Tyson
I'm burning these nigga like Niacin
I'm speeding, I don't have a licence
I'm bombing like Jerry, no Rice
Shooting the clip but I got me another one
Bussing, you running, No coming, No comment
Came up in trenches and nigga trying to turn a 7 gram into a whole onion
I know the Birdman, I can get them chickens in whenever I want
Give me the word man, I can call up baby, I can get them P's here in the morning
Pit in the fire, I'm spitting the fire
I think I'm a dragon, I'm all on the wire
Dressed to impress in my Balmain attire
These nigga be singin' like they in the choir
Was I gonna wanna be like Michael, no Myers
I do not hang with loners, I hang with buyers
Niggas  steal something, his ass goin' in the fryer
I cannot love her, I can just one-night her
Roll up the weed then

[Chorus]
Pass me that lighter, I'm in dis bih' wid a well known supplier
I wan' be just like Michael, yeah, Mike Myers
Your boyfriend cannot see me like a sniper
I get my kush and dopey off a boat
I swear to God, you hit my kush, you choke
My pockets look like bookies like I spoke
Catch your bitch and I make her sing a note
Start at the bottom, went straight to the top
Stop at the middle and pick up a knot
Proceed to the top cause nigga you hot
I might give dis bih' whatever I got

[Hook]
Yeah mon, set up a shop
Yeah mon, roll and I stop
Hey man, president watch
Hey mon, Ralph Lauren socks
Yeah mon!
