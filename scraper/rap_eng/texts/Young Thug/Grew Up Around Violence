[Hook: Duke]
Pass me the ball I’mma muhfucking sco’ (swoosh)
Maison Margiela my bitch tippy-toe (Maison Margiela that bitch)
Bih gotta take her shoes off at the door (shoes off hoe, c’mon)
I am no officer, I don't cuff hoes
Bitches be surprised, I'm stiff arming hoes like a Heisman
Thirsty ass bitch you conniving
Pockets on fat and they swole like a robber
These niggas broke and they lame, they need [?]
Fucking with thotties [?] in Follies
I got the heat in that bitch no Pat Riley
Came from the trenches I grew up around violence

[Verse 1: Duke]
Don’t fuck with no bitches long distance
I need a quickie I just need a minute
Soon as I fuck that little bitch man I’m dipping
Ask all the strippers yeah I’m a big tipper
Word around town them young niggas winning
Overlapping niggas I’m at the finish
Really need ducks in like we going fishing
Cook up in the lab like I am a chemist
These niggas know that they rats and they snitching
I don't play soccer but I do be kicking
Slaughter your daughter that bitch came up missing
I saw the struggle came up in them trenches
Nigga talk shit get a hundred round missile
I walked in the building fly like a frisbee
Pay these lil' pretty lil' bitches tuition
I walk right in and they stand like attention

[Hook: Duke]
Pass me the ball I’mma muhfucking sco’ (swoosh)
Maison Margiela my bitch tippy-toe (Maison Margiela that bitch)
Bih gotta take her shoes off at the door (shoes off hoe, c’mon)
I am no officer, I don't cuff hoes
Bitches be surprised, I'm stiff arming hoes like a Heisman
Thirsty ass bitch you conniving
Pockets on fat and they swole like a robber
These niggas broke and they lame, they need [?]
Fucking with thotties [?] in Follies
I got the heat in that bitch no Pat Riley
Came from the trenches I grew up around violence

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I’m in the street like a muhfucker
Pull up with your mom like a muhfucker
I pull up, hop out of the Rari now she wanna buy a forest (shhjeezskkkrt)
Don’t worry bout picking no fit, my bitch yellow like Safari (whhaat?)
I got a super secret interest, and I make the Rari tread a billion
I smoke on a garden keep it with me
Them bloods will keep it with me
I hop out the car its full of semis, you tryna make em envy
Leave in the car and keep it rental, we still got them P’s like we Miller

[Hook: Duke]
Pass the ball I’mma motherfuckin’ sco’ (swoosh)
Maison Margiela my bitch tippy-toe (Maison Margiela that bitch)
Gotta take her shoes off at the door (shoes off hoe, c’mon)
I am no officer, I do not cuff hoes
Bitches be surprised, step on a hoe like a Heisman
Thirsty ass bitch you connivin’
Came from the trenches I grew Up Around Violence
