Intro: Young Thug
Drinking on this good Actavis
OG Boo Dirty
Slime shit only, slatt, lets get it

[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm on it
I'm higher than you
Nigga, I'm on it
I swear I'm flyer than you
NASA NASA
NASA NASA
NASA bitch
I put bezels in my wrist
I put bezel on my bitch
I iced out all my clique
Hey, hey
I put bales inside the spot
I made all the blocks hot
Next thing you know I was top notch
Paid the cost cost cost
Back up lil bitch
I'm beside the hood set
Racks on me no duffle lil bitch
I'm eatin', no supper lil bitch
Ask yo main man, I'm the man
Haiti baby, thunder land

[Verse: Young Thug]
Diamonds inside of necklace
Still ridin' round with that stick like a battery
All white suits when your throw up blood, we just call that peppermint
I just took a L and I won't tell
Switch the game ova, I'm leadin' it
Last time I went into a jail, all my cases was erased it
Woke up, spent eleven hundreds on my shoes
Cause I'm not basic, Black diamonds on me but I ain't no racist
All white, blue so red without a chase
19 mo hundred,  just for my shoe not have laces

[Hook]
I'm on it, nigga I'm higher than you
I'm on it, I swear I'm flier than you

[Verse: OG Boo Dirty]
NASA NASA, lemme show you how we roll
Been Trappin' out the band, but I'm not a Migo
My plug a migo, wrap em tight as burrito
Get the rock dis' the rock
Now I'm ballin' like Chris Paul
Long way to get a hunid k and these Robin jeans
I'm stuntin' today
It was perfect timing when I started grinding now my nigga shinin', we blessed today
Four o's in that ocean spray
I'm chilling out, I'm gettin' high today
If the nigga play, fuck with me today
See gun smoke from the AK
I so love hundred bills, all I ever saw a gym (yea)
Get rich or die tryn (ya hear me)
Real, boy I'm trappin' fo' real
No show without a deal
Servin' propane like Hank call me King of the Hill

[Verse: Akon]
Aye, hold up, all my real niggas hold up
Stop in traffic like hold up
Put a wrist in sumthin', make you wanna throw up
See a lil' bad bitch, I want all that
I don't wanna have these doughnuts
Leave 'em once, fuck 'em twice and then pass 'em on to my dadats
See I'm the type of nigga that will come to the hood
And I'm makin' the money
I definitely live for the paper, nigga, betta come, I eat with the homies
You know me, my nigga, you know me far as you can throw me
Cause if you dun' know me, my nigga believe me, that'd be because it's phony
I'm on cloud 9, lets turn it up a notch
Got some bad bitches with me with my hand all up in her crotch
The crazy part about it, I don't even know her name
The broke bitches reach me, yo, nigga, we ain't the same
