[Intro]
Yeah, ey
Drinkin' color purple, ceiling color purple, ridin' color purple
What? What?

[Hook: Young Thug + Rich Homie Quan]
Hey, Oprah Winfrey bring me that color purple
Ey, Danny Glover bring me that color purple
Oh, double cup fill it up with color purple
Color purple
Bring that color purple, color purple, color purple
Bring that color purple
That color purple, bring that color purple
Bring that color purple, color purple, color purple

[Verse 1: Young Thug + Rich Homie Quan]
Drinkin' color purple, smokin' color purple
Bring it over when I'm nursin'
Quan off the surface
Which one you workin', what you sellin'? I'mma purchase
I am never earthin', ballin' like I'm nerfin'
Man I shoot that nig in person
Killin' what you worthin'
Break in baby purses
Draped in clothes like some curtains
Ohhhhhhh
Lil boo says "ohhhhh"
I'll bite you soon when I get home
I'm fly as a broom
Take off while sippin' on champagne
Ohhhhhhh
These bitches all like my domain
Hey, hey, ohhhhhh

[Hook: Young Thug + Rich Homie Quan]
Hey, Oprah Winfrey bring me that color purple
Ey, Danny Glover bring me that color purple
Oh, double cup fill it up with color purple
Color purple
Bring that color purple, color purple, color purple
Bring that color purple
That color purple, bring that color purple
Bring that color purple, color purple, color purple

[Verse 2: Young Thug + Rich Homie Quan]
Keep me ridin' in it, I could whip a belly too big for a loaf
Purple with the Remy, fuck her in the rental and it never comin' off
All my cars are tinted, you can't see what's in it then I'm ridin' off
Presidential lil skeet all in her mouth
Why your bitch gets one look, leach on a nigga, boss
Why the hell the lil bitch wanna bring two bihs to daddy house?
Do the lil bitch wanna play games? I'mma make her say "wow"
Lil destiny, no child
Ey, your music so chow
I'm purple just like a flower
I'm only purple just like a flower
I got front coach (?)

[Hook: Young Thug + Rich Homie Quan]

Bring that color purple, color purple, color purple
Bring that color purple
