[Intro: Offset]
That boy Cassius

Hey

[Chorus: Offset]
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' (ice)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' (ice)
Bitch you a thot, ain't trickin' (thot, thot)
Put her on her knee, make her lick it (lick it)
Patek on my wrist, and it's glistenin' (drip, drip)
The bitch got mad, I dissed her (hey)
Shawty, you ain't nothin' to a rich nigga (nothin')
I'll put a check on a bitch nigga (brrt)
Fuck your whole set and your clique, nigga (fuck 'em)
Got a gang full of dud and some broke niggas (dud)

[Verse 1: Offset]
Diamonds on me, what's the price? (price)
I'm not gettin' involved with the hype (hype)
I'm too rich to get into a fight (too rich)
Fifty racks got my jeans fittin' tight (fifty racks)
Pay the price and them boys come and wipe you
We had to dispose of the diaper (dispose)
Yeah we trap every week, every night (whoa)
Work my move, we too smooth, no indictments (hey)
Yeah, Freakazoid lightnin' (lightnin')
57 90 and it's bitin' (bite)
When I seen a mil I got excited (million)
For the cash I'ma turn to Michael Myers
Baguettes keep dripping, droppin' (drip)
My wrist all liquid watches (watch)
Told the bitch jump on my dick and pop it, ooh
Gave the little bitch a deposit
Cross on my neck, strap boxin', uh
Cup full of Tech, it's toxic
Draw down the SIG, chop chop chop 'em
Yeah, you dig, your bitch is an option
Put that watch in the fridge 'cause it's drippin', gettin' sloppy
When it's too much traffic gotta get a helicopter
Bentley Bentayga, no shoes on my carpet
No Vince Carter, fifteen with the carbon

[Chorus: Offset]
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' (ice)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' (ice)
Bitch you a thot, ain't trickin' (thot, thot)
Put her on her knee, make her lick it (lick it)
Patek on my wrist, and it's glistenin' (drip, drip)
The bitch got mad, I dissed her (hey)

Fuckin' with a quarter million, nigga, what a feelin' (feelin')
Abort the mission, nigga, they be tellin' off and squealin' (squealin')
Splash, took a bitch to Piccadilly (splash)
Water in my ear, gave a nigga wet willy (wet willy)
Came through drippin', spillin'
Walkin' with the bag (bag)
Tryna get my niggas all a milli, stack it to the ceilin' (ceilin')
Shootin' at civilians ('villians)
I'm the one dealin', I could make a killin' (killin')
Bags, can you smell it when I Vac-seal it? (uh)
Flag, nigga, throw it up, don't care about your feelin's (fuck 'em)
Ooh, what is this? What you wearin'? I be drippin' (what)
Cal Ripken's hit a nigga, Ken Griffey (home run)
The bitch got thick, so I guess she ate Jiffy
When she leave with me, I'ma fly her back to the city (for sure)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Go get the bag on the day off (racks)
Go get the rings out the playoffs (rings)
Pots in the beat, it's a bake off (packs)

Yeah, now that all my niggas free, tell me where the smoke at

[Verse 5: Future]
More smoke than Puff, bitch thick like buff
And I'm straight out the slum with the yayo
Snap on this shit like I'm Fabo (skrrt)
We got squares and bales in Clayco
All my money and cars biracial
I can't count up the stars, they head-top
Soon I sit in that foreign, my leg cop
I bought a straight-A Camaro with the crack rock
Hit a lick then I went and copped a Maybach
All shawty wanted was a dope boy (dope boy)
Never save a ho like a lifeguard
And I got the molly by the eight-ball
I get the bag on the daily day
I fucked the bitch on the Adderall
I put her up in my catalog
Soon as I came from the car lot, started fishtailing (skrrt), yeah
Shawty gon' squirt it then spit it out back, Israeli, yeah
Shawty gon' bust on the head-first, no paramedics, yeah
All I wanted, all I wanted was a hundred mil and I'm there already

[Verse 6: Young Thug]
Go get the bag on a day off (day off)
Niggas turnin' to a faceoff (faceoff)
I feel this aspirin like Rentanol
I got this shit out the bando (yeah)
I'm in the coupe with like nine hoes (nine hoes)
You better believe that they fine hoes (fine hoes)
I'm drippin' sauce with my eyes closed
Turned to a horse, I was riding hoes
Gator bump, they ain't swine though
Backburner full of fine hoes
Swag journeys, every kind though
Couple milli off a rhymes, whoa

[Verse 7: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Floral shit, stay in Gucci from the forest
Lean in my organs, walkin' on your mortgage
I got some jewelry, it cost me a fortune
Got a little freaky bitch and she gorgeous
Balmain sag on the Saint Laurent
I'm pourin' up that it's the time of the month
Diamonds hittin' like a Mortal Kombat punch
Servin' that cool, same color Nestle Crunch
Stackin' them hundreds up, I got a bunch
I can't tell the time, my dial done bust
Stay with that Glock, nigga know who I trust
Still in the trap, nigga servin' that raw dust
Come get your ho ,'cause you know she wan' fuck
Designer drugs serve like I'm wearin' a Gucci tux
Ride two cars back to back when I'm re-ing up
I'm on them percs, chasin' like I was on Tuss
Givenchy, gelato when I'm rollin' up
Me and Offset strapped up in the Bentley truck
Ooh, she suck it good, make it touch and bust
Too bad that lil bitch couldn't make the cut
I came in drippin', drippin' in designer
I got an essay, not an assignment
Too many chains on, my bitch start whining
Diamonds big rock like I'm mountain climbing

[Chorus: Offset]
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' (ice)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' (ice)
Bitch you a thot, ain't trickin' (thot, thot)
Put her on her knee, make her lick it (lick it)
Patek on my wrist, and it's glistenin' (drip, drip)
The bitch got mad, I dissed her (hey)
Shawty, you ain't nothin' to a rich nigga (nothin')
I'll put a check on a bitch nigga (brrt)
Fuck your whole set and your clique, nigga (fuck 'em)
