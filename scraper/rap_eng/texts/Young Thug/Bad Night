[Intro: Kanye West]
Ayy, uh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Somebody
Gotta be the bad guy
I had a bad day at work
Don't wanna have a bad night, ayy

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Woo! Told my wife I need a threesome
Woo! Be out all night until three somethin'
Woo! Yeezus Christ, I need three nuns
Woo! They gon' suck me off like a Capri-Sun
Haan? You see this coat? Mothafucka ask where I got the fleas from
Lookin' for the competition, I don't see none
They tell me be humble, tell 'em be somethin'
My two balls make her bust three nuts
Drink it out the bottle then I poured it on her D-cups (haan)
Ball so hard, went D1
Jumped over the Jumpman, just stumped the tree stump (woo)
Breakfast at the SOHO, give her FOMO like a mofo
Ooh, say she want gold, though what would she do for some logos?
Black girl want me for my Benz
White girl want me for my skin
Yeezy Season resurrected again
Who you with when it's me verse them, haan?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Somebody
Gotta be the bad guy
I had a bad day at work
Don't wanna have a bad night, ayy

[Refrain: Young Thug & Kanye West]
I ain't new to this shit, boy
I'm trappin' from the other side
So get outta your seat, stand up (wooooo!)
Stand up
A fuck nigga hate me while his old lady participate
Please tell that lil' nigga man up (lil' nigga, stand up, woo)
Stand up (lil' nigga, stand up)
Stand up (hey, hey)
Hey, hey, stand up, stand up, stand up

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
First of all, let me tell you somethin' (what?)
I don't give no fuck 'bout no niggas (woo)
I don't give no fuck, I'm not givin' two fucks (woah)
Roll up and pop one of these niggas (blat)
I do this shit for my woadies (woo)
You do this shit for your [?], you bitch
Shut the fuck nigga [?]
[?]
I'ma watch the nigga nose shatter like a picture
I'ma fuck his ho like [?] missile
I'ma keep a whole lotta lead for these pistols (what?)
And my money long like the nose on a [?]
But she a [?], she write, no pen
But you know I'm gon' suspend her

[Refrain: Young Thug]
I ain't new to this shit, boy
So get outta your seat, stand up
Stand up
A fuck nigga hate me while his old lady participate
Please tell that lil' nigga man up (lil' nigga, stand up, woo)
Stand up (lil' nigga, stand up)
Stand up (hey, hey)
Hey, hey, stand up, stand up, stand up

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Somebody
Gotta be the bad guy
I had a bad day at work
Don't wanna have a bad night, ayy

[Refrain: Young Thug]
I ain't new to this shit, boy
So get outta your seatâ€”

[Verse 3: Tyga]
I might have to jump from the three-point line
I might take a piss on the Hollywood sign
She always bite her lips every time she lyin'
She bite her lips every time she say she mine (woo, sheesh)
Can't be my baby with no "Maybe"
I'm always more truthful when I'm angry
I can't go to dinner with my lady
This fame shit's crazy
Nigga got more whips than slavery
My shit in Barney's sellin' like it's Macy's
Been two months since I talked to Jay-Z, this fame shit's crazy
