[Intro]
Woo! Woo!
Thugger!
Uh

[Verse 1]
Heard these niggas sneak dissing
I don't know how I'ma go about it
I had a bitch and then I left her
Cause she think I like a bitch that used to show her body
These silly games ain't nothing serious
If she fresh I know she fuck for something on her body
I swear to God I'm so delirious
That a Coke frame would make me empty my pockets
Rollie pollie ollie nigga
I got 3 strikes and I ain't bowling nigga, psh
I been poppin' lots of shit when I was rich
The same shit poppin' with a quarter nigga
Pockets are all swollen nigga
I want that face like a emoji nigga
I'm the same nigga boolin' on the block
Like it's never been a cop
Like my ring ain't worth a solar system

[Hook]
Come with me to paradise
I'll be your king you are my wife
I've never been in love oh my
I need you to complete these ties

[Verse 2]
Fuck a lake, I got fish here
Kill him, tell his momma get well
I'ma pull off watch me fishtail (skurrrrt!)
Spelling YSL
Where my lean at, I need potion
I ride the beat, I never roll it
I never gave them swag, they stole it
I transform like I'm in Otis
Let's play a game, bankrolls on us
Fresh kids, there are never same clothes on us
We the slimes, big snakes, can't poison us
Hundos in my pockets and they ain't old as us
Pussy niggas get buried today
All my ex bitches might get embarrassed today
I'm high as all flight attendants today
Milk carton your bitch is missing today

[Hook]
Come with me to paradise
I'll be your king you are my wife
I've never been in love oh my
I need you to complete these ties

[Verse 3]
This nigga talking about this
And this nigga talking about that
And I don't know who to believe
To be honest I don't care
Just keep that lying shit over there
I don't want that germ on my team
One bitch sucking on my dick
Another bitch eating her from the back
Tell me who wanna join the scene?
I said who wants to join the scene?
Boss up
B-O-S-S nigga, boss up
Run that check up and blow a lil some
Blow it then you stack it back up to the sun
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Come with me to paradise
I'll be your king you are my wife
I've never been in love oh my
I need you to complete these ties
