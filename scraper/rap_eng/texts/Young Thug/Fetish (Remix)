[Intro: Lil Keed]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Keed]
I'ma tell him if you know he got a stick and you know he gon' shoot 'bout me, yeah, yeah
Water that's on me and you know I got diamonds, them real VV's, yeah, yeah
Hit a bad bitch from the back and you know she leave cream on me, yeah, yeah
Mexico drivin', do the whole damn dash, yeah fuck police, yeah, yeah
Purple Hellcat with a whole four scat, you don't wanna race me, yeah, yeah
Burn his ass up, wet his ass up
Michael Jordan, hit him, know he ballin' up
Yeah I got a plug, yeah I'm havin' drugs
Bitches suck me up, yeah they eat the nut
Back to the motherfuckin' basics
Got the trap beatin' like the eighties, yeah
Snakes gon' cover my motherfuckin' back like a cape
Niggas gon' talk behind my back, not my face
Niggas gon' ride the whole wave like a slate
Bitch run the play and you know I don't wait
Know I got racks on me long way
Make one call, get you hit in the face
Pull up on the scene in a foreign machine
You who you is because of me
I pour the red, enjoy my sleep
Exotic weed, you not high as me
I fuck her good, she nut in her sleep
I roll a backwood, I'm chiefing the leaf
I made it out, I made 'em believe
Bad lil ho, she came from Belize
All they hate is all showin'
Naked bitches and they all goin'
Naked bitches, yeah they all blowin'

[Chorus: Lil Keed]
Money fetish, yeah money fetish, yeah, I got fetty
Y'all niggas broke, gettin' shit on credit
Talkin' like a parrot, yeah, bitch I'm fly rich, yeah
Bitch I'm fly rich, yeah, bitch I'm high rich, yeah
And I got VV, and I got on CC's
I just hit the ho CeeCee, yesterday by the BP
Nah it don't make no sense
Nah it don't make no sense
Nah it don't make no sense

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Money fetish, black bitch like Belly
I just put the symbol off the Benz on my necklace
I just told that bitch if she bad I'ma next it
I just took that tramp to the spot, neck, no Netflix
I just put a blimp behind my bitch and her boobs got fixed, ah
Hop on my dick and go apeshit, yeah
I just copped some bad young shit, walk in my crib, ayy
I was banging blood nigga, ever since it was a brim
Check my car fleet, Balenciaga car seat
I just hit  Little Rock bitch, right behind the BP
Nah it don't make no sense
(I done hit about ever one of them Little Rock bitches)
Nah it don't make no sense
(That's no cap)

[Chorus: Lil Keed]
Money fetish, yeah money fetish, yeah, I got fetty
Y'all niggas broke, gettin' shit on credit
Talkin' like a parrot, yeah, bitch I'm fly rich, yeah
Bitch I'm fly rich, yeah, bitch I'm high rich, yeah
And I got VV, and I got on CC's
I just hit the ho CeeCee, yesterday by the BP
Nah it don't make no sense
