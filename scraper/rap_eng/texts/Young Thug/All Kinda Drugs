[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm on all kinds of drugs
Shawty won't show me love
I'm on all kinds of drugs
She seen me throw it down
I'm on all kinds of drugs
Lil mama give it up
I'm on all kinds of drugs
Lil mama give it up
I'm on all kinds of drugs
I'm on all kinds of drugs
I'm on all kinds of drugs
I'm on all kinds of drugs

[Bridge: Young Thug & Bloody Jay]
She dont wanna screw up her lil remi
When I'm on them drugs I can't land I'm not disney
Big B cup thicker then honey where my biscuit
Look just like a star when they see me they make their wishes
Hey I'm Bloody Jay I'm an addict
Molly lean weed yes I got to have it
Ride and geek with Mondo we been at it all weekend
We keep going up,up,up
We can't sleep
