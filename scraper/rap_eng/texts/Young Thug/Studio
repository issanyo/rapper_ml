[Intro: Jacquees]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh
Jacquees sang

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
It's okay, baby, it's alright now
I know I'm gone some time on the other side of town
And up all night, I wish you were with me
If you were 'bout that life, you would come pull up on me

[Chorus: Jacquees]
Your mind is playin' tricks on you girl, yeah
Simply 'cause you know that the decision is yours, oh, oh
Baby girl, I know it's been a minute
Been a minute since I hit it
But I wanna do somethin' different (ok Jacquees, okay, okay)
I wanna fuck you in the studio
Please don't tell him where you goin' 'cause it really ain't his business
And lately I been drippin' sauce, I think you just want to lick it
Got a session in the Westin, I know that you wanna visit
I'ma lock the door, I'ma fuck you in the studio
I wanna fuck you in the studio
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2: Jacquees]
Your body's calling me, I'ma see what's up
Since you want it, I want it, pull up
No games will be played, don't think I'ma wait on you forever
Ain't nobody better than you, baby

[Chorus: Jacquees & Young Thug]
Your minds playing tricks on you, girl, yeah
Simply cause you know that the decision is yours, oh
Baby girl, I know it's been a minute
Been a minute since I hit it
But I wanna do somethin' different (oh yes I do, okay, okay)
I wanna fuck you in the studio
Please don't tell him where you're goin' 'cause it really it ain't his business
And lately I been drippin' sauce and I think that you just wanna lick it
Got a session in the Westin, I know that you wanna visit
I'ma lock the door, I'ma fuck you in the studio
I wanna fuck you in the studio
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Caught it in the studio, call me Julio, yeah
I'm just a real big playa, you can call me a Gigolo, ayy
'Bout to fuck you from the back, right in my studio, ayy
I'm 'bout to drip my swag, baby hold on, sit back
Watch a bitch ride my dick like a mongoose (ooh)
Make her drink Remy, nigga, call me Papoose (ooh)
Pockets full of blue-face hundreds, suwoop (ooh)
Straight from the back of the lab, make a beat too

[Chorus: Jacquees & Young Thug]
Baby girl, I know it's been a minute (been a minute)
Been a minute since I hit it (since I)
But I wanna do somethin' different (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I wanna fuck you in the studio
Please don't tell his where you're goin' 'cause it really it ain't his business (oh yeah)
And lately I been drippin' sauce and I think that you just wanna lick it (yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah)
Got a session in the Westin, I know that you wanna visit (I know)
I'ma lock the door I'ma fuck you in the studio, studio
I wanna fuck you in the studio (studio, studio, studio, studio)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
