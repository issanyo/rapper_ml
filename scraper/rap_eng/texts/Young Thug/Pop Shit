[ Verse 1: Casino]
Snap my doors out, put diamonds in them
Kiss your bitch, I'mm stylin in them
Matt blank Range Rover, got them sticks in them
Rollie on my wrist, I put like a sixty in it
Trap in the hood made like a milly in them
Gucci bed-to-toe, in my way them drippin in it
Put forty wop in the Mount Dew
Use seventeen, clip hold a seventeen
Out seventeen with a forty on my hip
You a damn shame you ain't got a hundred thousand
If I ever going broke then I'm taking mine back
Ten times that I had to triple up the stacks
Plug bring enough and I'm running off with that
Freebandz gang, I make you understand that
A hunnid in the real house, where the bloods at
Real rarri in the front, now who that he flex at
Trapped out there, geeked up
Cup filled up, I'm slowed up
I walk around looking like a lick
Take a random bitch and build a bitch

[Hook: Casino]
I'm worth like 99 bricks
All I do is stand and pop shit
Get out of line, you'll get popped quick
I stay flying in the sun quick
I'm married to this money, I'm dont disrespect
My ex-girl still dancing, mad cuz I left
I'm married to this money, I'm dont disrespect
My ex-girl still dancing, mad cuz I left

[Verse 2:  Young Thug]
Who that?
Oh that's Casino
He got his verse shaking when he brought that Phantom Limo (oh I've seen that)
He went that magic and throwed that here,  [can't to] pull of in the air
The kid's like...bingo
Well I'm here like bingo (bingo, bingo, kilos)
I got more rings than you got jewelry
Got way more guns than yall [bitches] got chains (way more guns)
And the cheapest, now take it off and put it on your brain (the cheapest ones, yeah)
You gone start chaos in this club if you throw these dubs
I got a thottie bitch and she suck dick, and how it [scrubs?]
I'm Tony Montana, day and night like Kid Kudi
I told a [?] brain
I caught my first murder one in Belize court
And do you missing like a milk court court
I heard they closed asses down in New Yo-o-ork
Now I got a couple stripper bitches all I support

[Hook: Casino]
I'm worth like 99 bricks
All I do is stand and pop shit
Get out of line, you'll get popped quick
I stay flying in the sun quick
I'm married to this money, I'm dont disrespect
My ex-girl still dancing, mad cuz I left
I'm married to this money, I'm dont disrespect
My ex-girl still dancing, mad cuz I left
