[Intro: Strick]
Yeah

[Chorus: Strick]
Top floor at Barney's, shoppin' out in New York (Ayy)
Uptown vibes, I got my medals on like a champion (Uh)
Olympic pool, all this water around my neck and wrist (Uh)
Got that tool, know how to use it, loose screw, yeah (Watch out)
Soon as she heard my voice, I think she found her groove, yeah
Million dollar sign, I think I hear another check ('Nother check)
My time, I see it all on the Rollie face
See you when I land, I took off, I might not be back

[Verse 1: Strick]
Check came with two commas, how you do that there?
Sent some prayers up to God, put my foot on they neck
I've been walkin' in some Guccis, I got high as a bitch
Cash out in Goyard and throw some racks on a bitch, yeah
Big times, hood rat
Slime, ball, YSL
Foundation, 8 set
Took a risk, now I'm countin' all day
Fuck Border Patrol, let my plug in (Woo)
I might pop out in the city with some Latins (Ayy)
Bentley Mulsanne magic carpet, I'm Aladdin
Been a star, but not at superstar status, yeah

[Chorus: Strick]
Top floor at Barney's, shoppin' out in New York (Ayy)
Uptown vibes, I got my medals on like a champion (Uh)
Olympic pool, all this water around my neck and wrist (Uh)
Got that tool, know how to use it, loose screw, yeah (Watch out)
Soon as she heard my voice, I think she found her groove, yeah
Million dollar sign, I think I hear another check ('Nother check)
My time, I see it all on the Rollie face
See you when I land, I took off, I might not be back

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
See you when you land (Yeah)
See you when you land (Yeah)
Call the gold Rolex, a stripper, watch you dance (Woo)
I got carats in both of my ears, saditty man (Yeah)
Tell a nigga pathetically that he not a man (Ha)
Flooded my body with diamonds 'til it's time to leave (Ha)
My drip is karate, I'm flawless and I'm out the streets (Ha)
I'm Tetris and reckless and fuckin' all the time (Yuh)
I count up a half of a million on the side (Woo)
They carats and flawless, baguettes in our chains (Ayy)
Young Strick been around me for years and never changed (Oh no)
I let him pick whatever he want (Yeah)
I told him "Break the bitch back and do it with form" (Yeah)

[Chorus: Strick & Young Thug]
Top floor at Barney's, shoppin' out in New York (Ayy, woo)
Uptown vibes, I got my medals on like a champion (Uh)
Olympic pool, all this water around my neck and wrist (Uh)
Got that tool, know how to use it, loose screw, yeah (Watch out)
Soon as she heard my voice, I think she found her groove, yeah
Million dollar sign, I think I hear another check ('Nother check)
My time, I see it all on the Rollie face
See you when I land, I took off, I might not be back (Back)
