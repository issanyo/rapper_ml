[Intro]
Hey, Thugger, Thugger, Thugger, baby
London the track, lil' bitch
Oh, yeah, yeah
Hey

[Chorus]
I just gave some red shoes to a Crip (nah, for real)
I just turnt up the whole city, then I dipped (watch me peal)
I just wanna get some head, I just want lips (what's the deal?)
I just wanna stack my cream an' eat some dip (eat some dip)
I just wanna spray they faces with this milk (hee-hee)
I got silky covers just to match my drip (wah-wah)
I just wanna drape my body with a quilt (ah-wah)
I just wanna drape my body with equipment (with equipment)

[Verse 1]
Fully loaded Simmons (loaded Simmons)
I see these bitches wanna fuck and suck my dicky (oh my God)
I know these niggas wanna be a part of my cliquey (oh my God)
I know these bitches wanna be a part of my mentions (oh my God)
I took too much Molly, I think I need a 'Xanny (oh my God)
He pop that ecstasy, get blue-eyed over Kenny (oh my God)
I fuck with hood bitches like I ain't got no standards (oh my God)
I did my thing, man, I think I need a Grammy (oh my God)
I told my bitch we gon' take a round trip (skrrt, skrrt)
Fifty large for a east-to-west-coast trip (oh my God)
They form a line, then I pick the one with hips (that's on God)
I'm in the Wraithy, I got stars on the ship

[Chorus]
I just gave some red shoes to a Crip (nah, for real)
I just turnt up the whole city, then I dipped (watch me peal)
I just wanna get some head, I just want lips (what's the deal?)
I just wanna stack my cream an' eat some dip (eat some dip)
I just wanna spray they faces with this milk (hee-hee)
I got silky covers just to match my drip (wah-wah)
I just wanna drape my body with a quilt (ah-wah)
I just wanna drape my body with equipment (with equipment)

[Verse 2]
I know these pussy niggas hear me (I know these pussy niggas hear me)
But that street shit's still in me (but that street shit's still in me)
I'ma keep some niggas with me (I'ma keep some niggas with me)
Gettin' them foreigns new, we don't do no limits (stupid bitch)
On the intro an' the outro (woah)
2009, daddy had the star bangles (woah)
2017, drive a pair of Rolls (skrrt)
I fucked up, count the money, I'ma count it all (count it all up)
Yeah, an' you surprising me, yeah
Who'd ever think you be disgusing me?
God, I'm so sorry, my apologies
Colorful money, Monopoly

[Chorus]
I just gave some red shoes to a Crip (nah, for real)
I just turnt up the whole city, then I dipped (watch me peal)
I just wanna get some head, I just want lips (what's the deal?)
I just wanna stack my cream an' eat some dip (eat some dip)
I just wanna spray they faces with this milk (hee-hee)
I got silky covers just to match my drip (wah-wah)
I just wanna drape my body with a quilt (ah-wah)
I just wanna drape my body with equipment (with equipment)

[Outro]
I'ma wild out on 'em (whew, whew, ayy)
Watch me call out on 'em (whew, whew, ayy)
Watch me stall out on 'em (whew, whew, whew)
Nick Cannon, wild on 'em

These bitches wild out on 'em
Nigga, wild out on 'em
These bitches wild out on 'em, also
Do your big bags with the cash flow
Put your big bag, let your cash flow
Got your big bags an' everybody know it
You got it on, you everybody showin'
