Yeaaaahhhhh
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Chorus]
Feel like a mac, ayy
I gottem attached, ayy
Stackin' these racks, ayy
Got cheese in the back, ayy
Pullin' up in the 'rari
I got his bitch, I won't say sorry
She told me she want me to marry her
I finally broke down the barrier
I got a lot of money on me
I had to put the Rollie on me
That ain't no Colt 40 on me
But I got a whole 40 on me
I got a lot of people takin' pics
Thinkin' it's YSL, we gotta drip
I'm gettin' high as hell up in the whip
I just be side steppin' on a bitch

[Verse 1 - T-Shyne]
They ain't never done this thing before
Niggas be talkin' shit they broke
I'm in the Hamptons on a boat
In the middle of the road just like a float
Niggas be trying to get all the hoes
She just put a lot of money in her nose
I'm about to get inside her and expose
I'm on, you wrong, yea
You ain't poppin' for that long, yea
I'm in Cali blowin' strong, yea
Got a baddie in a thong, yea
I'm a hit it then I'm gone, yea
Thank God the Henny strong, yea
This lil nigga don't belong here
There's a lot of shit going on here

[Chorus]
Feel like a mac, ayy
I gottem attached, ayy
I'm stackin' these racks, ayy
Got cheese in the back, ayy
Pullin' up in the 'rari
I got his bitch, I won't say sorry
She told me she want me to marry her
I finally broke down the barrier
I got a lot of money on me
I had to put the Rollie on me
That ain't no Colt 40 on me
But I got a whole 40 on me
I got a lot of people takin' pics
Thinkin' it's YSL, we gotta drip
I'm gettin' high as hell up in the whip
I just be side steppin' on a bitch

[Verse 2 - Young Thug]
I put the Rolls Royce in the VIP
Hold up, leave 'em crip
Put my name on a blimp
Food chain unequipped
[?]
For the low like dips
IPhone 10, Happy Birthday on the blimp
Good on the champagne, I don't sip
Got a real model thang on my tip
I'm a big dog, you a wimp
All my Simpsons slang talk
Bet your bitches Bang Bros
Adios A-migo
What you think this thang for?
You know I stain for
When I say 'Gang Gang' yo
Yellow barrel, gauge low
Real pimp, no cane though
And I gotta aim though
Standing with a mink on
Told the Colts I'm playing corner
Intercept your main hoe
I sip syrup, yea bro
You can have the hangover
[?] how you doin'?
All gangstas know how it go

[Chorus]
Feel like a mac, ayy
I gottem attached, ayy
I'm stackin' these racks, ayy
Got cheese in the back, ayy
Pullin' up in the 'rari
I got his bitch, I won't say sorry
She told me she want me to marry her
I finally broke down the barrier
I got a lot of money on me
I had to put the Rollie on me
That ain't no Colt 40 on me
But I got a whole 40 on me
I got a lot of people takin' pics
Thinkin' it's YSL, we gotta drip
I'm gettin' high as hell up in the whip
I just be side steppin' on a bitch
