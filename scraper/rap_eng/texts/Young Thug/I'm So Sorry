[Intro: Young Thug]
Getting money is a hobby, hobby, hobby
I'm so sorry
Getting money is a hobby
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Got a bad bitch running through the lobby

[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Getting money is a hobby
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Got a bad bitch running through the lobby
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Getting money is a hobby
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Got a bad bitch running through the lobby

[Verse 1: Spenzo]
I'm so sorry I'm ahead of my time
Y'all lil' niggas ain't up on my level
I'm so sorry that they think I'm Illuminati
Y'all niggas so high, I swear worshipping the devil
I'm so sorry I never take a break
I'm too busy taking food off of niggas' plates
I can't even take my chick out on a date
I'm too busy making moves in another state
Man I'm so sorry, I'm so honest
I can see the future, you're gonna be a nobody
I'm so sorry [?] with your girl
Chi-chi-chick like a thottie
I'm so sorry that I bought a Bugatti
And a brand new Ferrari at the same damn time
I'm so sorry that your girl don't pick up
She was too busy tryna bang my line, man
I'm so sorry I don't fuck with nobody
I'm just not anybody, I can't fuck with everybody
Who the fuck is you boy, you out your body
Beat a nigga down like 12 [?] me
You know I got racks just like Yo Gotti
Kicks on my feet, looking like I know karate
When I'm on a track, nigga, I'm a catch a body
Call the producer tell him I'm so sorry, nigga


[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Getting money is a hobby
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Got a bad bitch running through the lobby
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Getting money is a hobby
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Got a bad bitch running through the lobby

[Verse 2: Spenzo]
I'm so sorry, what did I do wrong?
Man, these niggas can't do shit right
I'm so sorry that this ain't your song
Muthafucka you can't live my life
I'm so sorry that I got a different chick
Running through the lobby in the muthafucking night
I'm so sorry that a nigga booked up, look up
In a different city every other night
Nigga you so sorry, you got a nigga so [?]
Got your chick going crazy, [?] is
I'm so sorry when a nigga get paid
Ain't it like the money you've been saving up for years?
I'm so sorry, I ain't tryna be cocky
But a nigga from the [?] shit, can nobody stop me
All these hitters 'round me, shit, can nobody rob me
You ain't get the memo, gettin' [?] is the hobby
I'm so sorry, I'm the best ever
Can't be touched Floyd Mayweather
You should have known better, I'm too clever
Tell the competition they need to get they shit together
[?] for muthafuckin leather
Walk through the club, change the muthafucking weather
It don't really matter, we can do this shit whenever
I'm so sorry, we gonn' do this shit forever, nigga


[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Getting money is a hobby

Got a bad bitch running through the lobby
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Getting money is a hobby
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
