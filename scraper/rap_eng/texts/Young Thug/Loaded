[Intro : Young Thug]
Thugger, Thugger nigga!
Yeeur, Yeeur!
(MPA, YSL shit, nigga)

[Hook: Young Thug]
Hundred bands in my pants, YSL loaded
Got them choppers in advance, MPA, they loaded! (loaded)
Who the fuck told you lil' niggas you was soldiers?(Who that?)(Who?Who?)
Who the fuck told you lil' niggas you was soldiers?(Who told you that?)
I'm just sayin' homie (sayin' nigga... I'm sayin')
Nigga I'm just sayin' homie (sayin' my nigga..I'm sayin')

[Verse 1 : Young Thug]
(Uh!) Plottin' on Donald Trump (woo! woo!)
I was 15 years old when I shot that chopper (rrraah rrrah rraaow!)
I bought a carbine 15 when I was 18 (And what?)
Sent a couple niggas to the doctor (yooo!) (bah bah bah!)
I rape it, I finger that 'xtendo (Woo!)
I peel it, I feel it
I take all they stuff and I head to the 'hill with it (wooooooooo!)
Let PeeWee deal with it
Back in the day I was actin' illiterate
I'm hot like a skillet bitch
My gators look like they got Syphillis
My bitches be bleedin' like literally
I slime my fake brothers (I slime my fake brothers)
I'm not Casino, but Thugger be killin' it
Killin' it, killin' it (Killin' it, killin' it killin' it!)
Do not think I'm tripping when I say "Longway be the real-iest"
I said do not think I'm tripping when I say "Bitch, I be the real-iest"

[Verse 2 : PeeWee Longway]
I go to the 'hill with the hipp-iest
Loaded down with nothin' but Benjamins
Piped up and shot an Olympia
OG, we wrappin' and shippin' it
Who told you lil' niggas i ain't with the shits?
Pull up and hop out with dirty sticks
We comin' for nothin' but 36
Them birdies for all of you idiots
We snatch' 'em and take all your giblets
Young Thugger Thugger just told you we killin' it
How could you lil' niggas be soldiers?
I go down yo' roster ain't none of you killin' shit
I move like a monster real swiftly
I smoke like a rasta Chief keef'n the reefer (ganja!)
I'm loaded with OG dispensary (good gas!)
Kardashian, my ho just like Kimberley
A nigga sadiddy like Hilary
First to ship down,and I kick it in Beverley
Loaded with Benjamin Franklin
Walkin' through Beverly Center with etiquette
Issuing out so many bars, the cameras are rolling
They tryna edit it (Longway!)
Jawbreaker, jawbreaker, jawbreaker
I got that hard like "Ed, Edd, n' Eddy"
