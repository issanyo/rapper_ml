[Intro: Kanye West & Young Thug]
High lights
Tell my baby I'm back in town
High lights
Tell everybody I'm back in town
High lights
Tell my baby I'm back in town
High lights

[Hook: Kanye West & Young Thug]
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights

[Verse 1: Kanye West, The-Dream & Young Thug]
Can we play that back one time?
And after that night I'm gon' wanna play this shit back (shit back)
I don't know (I don't know)
Sometimes I'm wishin' that my dick had GoPro (GoPro)
So I could play that shit back in slo-mo (in slo-mo, slow motion)
I just shot an amateur video; I think I should go pro (go pro)

[Hook: Kanye West, The-Dream & Young Thug]
We only makin' the highlights (highlights, slow motion, slow motion)
Diamonds in the sunlight
We only makin' the highlights (slow motion, slow motion)
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be only be highlights (Yeah, just one night)

[Bridge: El Debarge & Kanye West]
One life, one night
Uh
High lights
Shine like me
Livin' the life 'til I die

[Verse 2: Kanye West & The-Dream]
I bet me and Ray J would be friends
If we ain't love the same bitch
Yeah, he might have hit it first
Only problem is I'm rich
High...
Lights...
21 Grammys, superstar family
We the new Jacksons, I'm all about that action
I'm about that Farrakhan (We only making the)
Life is a marathon (high)
I'ma shift the paradigm (lights)
I'ma turn up every time
I'ma bust a coach's head open on some Diddy shit (I live my life)
If he ever talk to my son like an idiot (on the high lights)
So conflicted
Petty and specific
Got a hundred stories in the building
Y'all niggas is midget
Advice to all my niggas
Impregnate Bridgette (Oh no)
So when she have a baby she gon' make another nigga (gotta play this shit back)
And eventually it's gon' be so many niggas
Great pool party and the weekend that's the business
This one white girl told me she hate white cock
That's when I knew hip-hop was the new rock
Might tell a lesson and still is my mentor
Famous people act so damn pretentious huh
What you need just a hour or some interest huh
[?] thick dick [?] huh
Got the Fruit of Islam in the trenches huh? (da di da, da di da)
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian huh? (da di da)
She spent her whole check on some Christians huh? (da di da, da di da)
And that bitch ain't even religious huh? (da di da)
Walkin', livin', breathin', girl you know my past well
Hard to believe in God, your nigga got killed
Bad bitches fuckin' Rob, though he overweight
I wish my trainer would, tell me what I overate
So when I'm on vacay, I need to kick back, hah!  (ooh na na na na na)
What you want?
You want a boss or an R&B nigga with a six pack? (ooh na na na na na)
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox (ooh na na na na na)
I need to know right now if you a freak or not (ooh na na na na na)
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox (ooh na na na na na)
I need to know right now if you a freak or not

[Outro: The-Dream]
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I wanna know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I wanna know right now if you a freak or not
