[Intro]
Yeah, Young Thugger Thugger baby
Huh, Slatt, Slatt
Slatt, Slatt, Slatt, Slatt, Whoo


[Chorus]
Hennesy and vibing with somebody lady
Balling living large everybody playin'
Fuck the whole ward baby stop the playin’
Money steady growin', getting outdated
I do it real big in these nigga face
Bare, she wireless, imma play her, baby
I got the latest car every summer, aye (Skrt, Skrt)
I might go get the Rarri, Slim Shady

[Verse 1]
Leave the cars parked outside runnin'
Only bad bitches and real niggas coming
I’m throwing my cash nigga costly costly
All your bitches bad like they need some counseling
Bitches jumping off the pole
Bitches jumping in and off the fucking pole
Big old slimes at ya door
Cut the grass i'll make you coming more
Chanel bags by the twelve case
I'm out ya class like a stairway
These niggas telling on the twelfth day
My bitch a Cancer, no prostate
Everybody good like your pops say
Got some neighbors banging at the swap, mate
All these bitches switching they don't know how to stay
Leave 'em in the trenches and get out the state
(Hey, ey)

[Chorus]
Hennesy and vibing with somebody lady
Balling living large everybody playin'
Fuck the whole ward baby stop the playin'
Money steady growin', getting outdated

Hit him with the choppa leave his arm dangling
