[Intro: Young Thug]
So what's up with all that goddamn tough talk you had earlier on the phone, you know what I'm saying? When you said you was gon' goddamn do this and that to me when you saw me?
(freaky-deeky)
Where all that at? Oh I thought so
You got high a level of confidence, you know what I'm saying

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You said you gon' fuck me to death when you see me
You said that, you said that
You said you gon' do me the worst, I remember you right when you said that
You said you gon' kiss from my neck to my chest to my naval and dick and nuts
We talked about everything, then you know that we got us some making up
I lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears
I bite on her butt and I suck on her toes and her soul go outta here
She look at him like he roadkill and I turned 'round her life like I'm Dr. Phil
Let's get freaky deeky 'round here

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
Say now, ooh, ooh, ooh
Say now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to say now)
Say now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to say now)
Say now (Jeffery!), ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I got the door unlocked
And I know right now she'd rather have my dick than a watch (facts)
And I'm not right about everything, but I got a strong feeling she'll take me a charge if we run into the narcs
And I'm seeing all your emotions, came a long way from roaches
Unwrap the birds, get to rolling
I ain't never needed nothing brodie
All full pocket, macaroni
Rose-gold AP like a token
Bought that bitch a mink, now she cozy
Rather go to jail, I ain't told 'em
I get excited when I see you
I'd rather freeze up and get shy when I see you
I'm daydreaming and Iâ€™m steady just strappin' our child in the rearview
If you a cool one you a real one
Let's go to Africa, to the Pilgrim

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You said you gon' fuck me to death when you see me
You said that, you said that
You said you gon' do me the worst, I remember you right when you said that
You said you gon' kiss from my neck to my chest to my naval and dick and nuts
We talked about everything, then you know that we got us some making up
I lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears
I bite on her butt and I suck on her toes and her soul go outta here
She look at him like he roadkill and I turned 'round her life like I'm Dr. Phil
Let's get freaky deeky 'round here

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug & Quavo]
Say now, ooh, ooh, ooh
Say now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to)
Say now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to)
Say now (say now), ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Last week she told me we ain't gon' make it past this day
We in my house, she wanted me to leave, but where am I gonna stay?
She hid the keys in the attic, she even tried to hide my Patek
Please stop being petty, I don't want no more spaghetti
My side bitch in the driveway, yeah
Waiting on you to leave, bae, yeah
You gotta know, yeah, the time changed
I don't know what's on your mind frame
But I gotta go and gangbang
The streets mine so I switch lanes
You said "I won't change" (won't change)
You said "I won't change" (won't change)
I regret I put you up on game (regret it)
I regret I told your mama "Life would change," (momma)
Yeah, out of all the cash, I put on her
Out of all the bags, I put on her
And I said I don't brag, I don't boast
Since you popped the tags, I don't want 'em
And my niggas they been placed the vote
But you needed to get off the boat
I can't blame it on me I said "No"
Got her head so big it explode

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You said you gon' fuck me to death when you see me
You said that, you said that
You said you gon' do me the worst, I remember you right when you said that
You said you gon' kiss from my neck to my chest to my naval and dick and nuts
We talked about everything, then you know that we got us some making up
I lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears
I bite on her butt and I suck on her toes and her soul go outta here
She look at him like he roadkill and I turned 'round her life like I'm Dr. Phil
Let's get freaky deeky 'round here

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
Say now, ooh, ooh, ooh
Say now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to)
Say now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to)
Say now (say now), ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Let's make our last toast (Jeffery), she gets the last gulp
I got some Actavis yeah, I want the last dose
I got a good cash flow, but I don't want the fast dough
Young Thugger got filthy rich, I came right out the rat-hole (facts)
I smoked a whole leaf, I'm drinking codeine
I want some head and knees, I don't want no teeth
I should've called off, I'm bout to OD
In her mouth like a golf ball, my two homies
Lay it up on me, I make her squirt on the couch, eww
Private party, only broads here
We pass forty caps, no beers (got the forty capsule)
Every diamond on me crystal clear
Molly on me, baby, take it off of me (off of me)
CAT scan, white stuff on my jeans (lap dance)
Hit it from the back, loosen up her spleen (Aye)
Say you mine, I'ma take it off and raw dog

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You said you gon' fuck me to death when you see me
You said that, you said that
You said you gon' do me the worst, I remember you right when you said that
You said you gon' kiss from my neck to my chest to my naval and dick and nuts
We talked about everything, then you know that we got us some making up
I lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears
I bite on her butt and I suck on her toes and her soul go outta here
She look at him like he roadkill and I turned 'round her life like I'm Dr. Phil
Let's get freaky deaky around here

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
Say now, ooh, ooh, ooh
Say now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to)
Say now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to)
Say now, ooh, ooh, ooh
