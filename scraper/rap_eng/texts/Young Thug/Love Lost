[Chorus: Strick]
Let me know
Goin' to get this money, no love lost
Driving to that Lamb, it's sayonara, yeah
Driving in my bitch from Tokyo
Samurai sword, cut the diamonds on my charm
Put that play in motion, watch 'em go
Take it off your chest, we heavily armed, yeah
No TSA, fly like the airforce
Get rich or die broke, nigga it's your choice

[Verse 1: Strick]
Never been number two even though they say I'm the shit
Getting topped up from a broad that look like Pamela
Yeah, Anderson
If he talking then we duct tape him and his son
Laying out them carbon-15's, sound like engine
Ain't cars in the door, I'm just marathon
I got hoes 'round the globe, wide area
I told her bring her girl, we can improvise, no
From rags to riches, I was chosen
Oh, the riches, don't make me ride solo

[Chorus: Strick]
Let me know
Goin' to get this money, no love lost
Driving to that Lamb, it's sayonara, yeah
Driving in my bitch from Tokyo
Samurai sword, cut the diamonds on my charm
Put that play in motion, watch 'em go
Take it off your chest, we heavily armed, yeah
No TSA, fly like the airforce
Get rich or die broke, nigga it's your choice

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
D'usse on my wrist, that means my diamonds are black
I pop a Tesla then have a heart attack (slatt slatt slatt)
On all of my bitches, make 'em say free Yak (free Yak)
I got too many bitches on dick and my chest and my motherfuckin' back (my motherfuckin' back), yeah
I'm perpetrating again, I'm on the Tesla and the Lamb
I got racist friends, and they dead but I don't give no damn
I got fifty dollar bills today and I'm in the pink slip (what?)
I got chips, I told Strick to take the run and grab the dip (grab it)
While he at it I told him grab some rubber bands (twenty racks)
2009 I was in a Rover, not a Sedan (skrrt)
These ain't e-mail killers, nigga we don't spam (killers)
'Bout to put lambskin rugs in the Lamb

[Chorus: Strick]
Let me know
Goin' to get this money, no love lost
Driving to that Lamb, it's sayonara, yeah
Driving in my bitch from Tokyo
Samurai sword, cut the diamonds on my charm
Put that play in motion, watch 'em go
Take it off your chest, we heavily armed, yeah
No TSA, fly like the airforce
Get rich or die broke, nigga it's your choice

[Verse 3: Strick]
Went to get a bag, I had to take a risk for it
I just want my wrist to shine like sunrise, six in the morning
I just told my mama I stay prayed up, I know the day was coming
Double up all them commas on them checks even though they say we couldn't
Damn, all this sauce, I could've been a cook, yeah
That's a bar, me and Dilla doing good, yeah
Niggas caught on, niggas was sleep
Damn I might have to charge a late fee
Ain't trusting none of these niggas, that F&N got no safety
Rap saved me
I'm just doing what I'm 'posed to do, nigga how the fuck you hate me?
Could've been you, could've been you
Could've been us but I couldn't never let you play me

[Chorus: Strick]
Let me know
Goin' to get this money, no love lost
Driving to that Lamb, it's sayonara, yeah
Driving in my bitch from Tokyo
Samurai sword, cut the diamonds on my charm
Put that play in motion, watch 'em go
Take it off your chest, we heavily armed, yeah
No TSA, fly like the airforce
Get rich or die broke, nigga it's your choice
