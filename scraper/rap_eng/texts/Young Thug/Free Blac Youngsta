[Intro]
Wheezy beats
I'm eating Hot Cheetos and shit, still recording know what I mean
And some girl recording me, Prince
Slatt!

[Chorus]
Gave a couple racks to your momma
Just to say free Blac Youngsta
Lighting these woods in the morning
R.I.P. yo momma
All I say is Free Blac Youngsta
All I say is Free Blac Youngsta
Fuck 12, Free Blac Youngsta
Free Blac Youngsta
Let a dime bitch take the top off
Hop in foreigns with the top down
Sucking up, while the top down
Them hunnids like limousines for the top dogs
Free my dogs

[Verse 1]
Hunnids like limousine
Lil shawty she Phillipine
Everything bout me mean
I might be fresh off a bean
I might be fresh off a perc
I might be fresh off a murk
I'm out here, 'cuz I be lurkin
I pack out this hoe and skirt
Get some more bands for these bitches
I just switch the bands or you're paying, real niggas
Promise I can stand and gon get it
We still go up on a Tuesday
I just spend a bag on Dusse
Bitch tryna drown me I'm swimming
And I'm not 2 Chainz, but I'm riding 'round and I'm getting it
I just got a new Mulsanne, and I'm bout to park my Bentley, yeah
I just got some Goyard frames, and I'm bout to take your bitch today
I'm about to turn up
Fuck around and turn it up
I don't wanna sip of punch
I'mma make her swallow my nuts
You don't fuck with me for what?
I can see you flexing drinking Tuss
I got fours poured up
I was drinking Act nothing else
You can ask Sprite by us
Ice in the cup don't melt
Off-red, Saint Laurent belt
How they gone sue they self

[Chorus]
Gave a couple racks to your momma
Just to say free Blac Youngsta
Lighting these woods in the morning
R.I.P. yo momma
All I say is Free Blac Youngsta
All I say is Free Blac Youngsta
Fuck 12, Free Blac Youngsta
Free Blac Youngsta
Let a dime bitch take the top off
Hop in foreigns with the top down
Sucking up, while the top down
Them hunnids like limousines for the top dogs
Free my dogs

[Verse 2]
I like your walk, ooh
I just caught the dawgs, ooh
Act like your walk, ooh
Living it up, to let you ball, ooh, ooh, ooh
Bouncing up and down, ooh, ooh, ooh
We go 'round and 'round, woo, woo, woo
Side to side and down, woo, woo, woo
Ring around the Rosie, woo, woo

[Chorus]
Gave a couple racks to your momma
Just to say free Blac Youngsta
Lighting these woods in the morning
R.I.P. yo momma
All I say is Free Blac Youngsta
All I say is Free Blac Youngsta
Fuck 12, Free Blac Youngsta
Free Blac Youngsta
Let a dime bitch take the top off
Hop in foreigns with the top down
Sucking up, while the top down
Them hunnids like limousines for the top dogs
Free my dogs
