Come here tempt me if you wan' go on a date

I take care my daddy momma by pullin' up with them bundles
If I ain't treat you good little baby just know it's karma
You did my nigga wrong, I know it, it was last summer
Lyin' to me, tellin' me I'm the bomb like Osama
I wish I could spend 50 bands on tour for grandmama
I'll crack that nigga head with a bottle
I could never call, not a fed, not a cop
Niggas sit on the bench and I said do ya'll
YSL scream "fuck the rest" cause we got right now
Niggas asked me "Am I sure?", and the Bentley said “Yeah”
That little bitch ask for a purse and you know I said "Yeah"
She gone act just like a clerk when them feds in there
She might act like she know Bird when them players in there, Yeah
