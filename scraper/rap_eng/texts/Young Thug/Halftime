[Intro]
Turn up, thugga, thugga, ayy, let's go
Halftime, half a perc and half a xanny, nigga, halftime
Half a pint, pour up an eight, my nigga, halftime
Tryna rob that stick, turn his body to halftime (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Hit the streets and tear this bitch up like I'm Willie B
No Tennessee, but the chain on my neck is a T
No Memph' Bleek, bitch, I own the Roc, not Jay Z, ya dig?
War Ready like Tracy T, ya dig?
Racks on racks on racks, just might pull up on my Spider
All my diamonds black, you can motherfuckin' knight 'em
All these pussy niggas whack, I'm a murk 'em every night'll
Pull up screamin', "Blat," got my motor out a Viper
Got 100 million flat like my motherfuckin' idol
I might eat it, I might lick it, but I swear I'll never bite 'em
Every time I dress myself, it go motherfuckin' viral
Pussy niggas stealin' swag, bring my shit back like recycles
I might ask her for some head
I don't know that ho, I act like she dead
Insurance on my money like a wreck
Every time I see her, she lick the cleavage
Fuck her on a $10,000 bed
I could never love her, fuck her head
Suck my dick like Beavis, no Butthead
Cocaine white like Justin Bieber, bitch
I might show the racks and tease the bitch
I might want it but I don't need the bitch
I been flooded out by Jesus bitch
I want your pizza, Little Caesar's bitch
Ninth Ward, I buy my diesel, bitch
I don't wanna talk or see a snitch
No teacher, we chalkin' shit
I passed school, I'm passin' all the staffs
I just want that neck like a giraffe
I like fish in water, I'm a bear
17.5, I shave it like it's Nair
Lay out, watch the kids like a daycare
I don't play games, no, I'm not the fair
I got Hot Wheels like a motherfuckin' chariot (skrt)
Chanel Vintage, boy, this shit is rare

[Chorus]
Hey, a good time, hey, let's have a good time
Hey, a very good ti-i-iiime
Hey, let's have a very good time, hey, a very good time
Hey, ooh, let's have a very good ti-i-iiime

[Verse 2]
I done figured this shit out, if you think you gone bite on my swag, it's a virus
I don the swag and I pull up on bitches dressed in all white like Miley Cyrus
No, I'm not gay, I fuck bitches on bitches, I whip out, she suck on my private (Suck it!)
Lil nigga play, I'ma catch him down bad and then stick 'em fold 'em like a wallet (Ooh)
I swear to God there's only one of me and these bitches three-deep like a trident (Ooh)
Iâ€™m walkin' through it like tons of the ones and these bitches grabbin', I'm at Follies (Ooh)
Fuck nigga, try me, I swear to God, lil whoadie done pull up and pop at his noggin' (Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
Bitch, I got water, I look like I'm fresh from Hawaii
Havin' the time of my motherfuckin' life
I'm gonna buy everything I want, I can't think twice
You can turn the ice tray off, baby, I'm havin' ice
As long as I live, wouldn't want a wife

[Chorus]
Hey, a good time, hey, let's have a good time
Hey, a very good ti-i-iiime
Hey, let's have a very good time, hey, a very good time
Hey, ooh, let's have a very good ti-i-iiime
