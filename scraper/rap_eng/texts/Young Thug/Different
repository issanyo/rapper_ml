[Intro]
Rich Homie Quan
It's something about you shawdy
I don't know what it is
Rich Homie Baby

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I say she different from all the other girls
And I don't need to search, Travel the world
Made some decisions, it's my fault if I get hurt
And I know I'm gon' get what I deserve

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Shawty always think a nigga cheatin'
Offer her that number two position if you ain't wanna be here (Be quiet ho!)
All she talk is shit but I can't hear it
Stupid bitch, I might just leave you, I'm serious
I do it all for you (I do it baby)
Ho, you might be crazy if you cannot understand what i'm saying girl
You know what i do (You know)
But since the bitch playing stupid, got (?)
No second guessing, girl, you know that I shoot
Ready for whatever, anytime, for the weather
Do you digg what I'm saying, I ain't talkin' about a shovel
She feel me cause I'm the man, it's something about hey, boy
Plus

I don't know, I don't know what it is but you're different
And I don't know, I don't know what it is but you are different

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
She different from them other bitches
Lil' shorty a keeper, hell yeah, she like them other bitches
I fuck her then I beat her, I don't treat her like them other niggas (But you are different)
I think that's the reason I'm in love, cause you are (Different)
Baby, you my sky, I put nothing above cause you are different
I would've fucked your friend but I liked you instead
Girl, you know you are (Different)
After the first time we fucked, I ain't tell nobody
Because you seem so (Different) (Ah)
I ain't gotta flex, out of all the bitches I done met
Nobody got nothing on your sex
No alphabet baby but I still F around with my ex
My new bitch got me going crazy
Think I'm seeing ghosts, feeling like Patrick Swayze
Pussy wetter than the motherfucker
Like that bitch got out the Navy (But ya different)
