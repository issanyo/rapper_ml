[Intro: Young Thug]
I got like 5 million and 12 hundred thousand hoes
They drippin' all over my motherfuckin' clothes

[Hook: Young Thug]
Let's go off the dome, I can't make it home
I fucked her, I boned her, she leave an aroma
They calling my phone up, my girl like "What's going on?"
She sucking, put me in a coma, I nut on that fish on my sofa

[Bridge: Young Thug]
Yeeeeeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Yeeeeeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Yeeeeeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
What's brackin'

[Verse 1: Young Thug & Lil Duke]
Dickie suit, chucks
Flag hanging to the right
Put that young bitch in a bucket
Kid Cudi, fuck her all day and all night
Ok, I'm in this bitch with lil Duke, Longway
You can be with me, you too, four way
Put that bitch off from my deuce, slow day
I'ma sell at least like 2
Thugga Thugga what it do
Riding in the fast lane, I'm eluding (Skrrr)
All these drugs that we abusing (drugs)
Addicting to winning, not losing
I'm in the kitchen just cooking (cook it up)
Middle finger to a bookin' (fuck em)
Fuck running off, fuck nigga I took it
Diamond so wet, I might need to douche it
Diamonds they shower, they shower me
Yes that lil nigga I got with me
When it's war my niggas count on me
Beyonc√© bitch I'm a bumble bee
This the B-hive, this my turf bitch, you can't sting on me
Jingle bells, baby you can ring on me

[Hook: Young Thug]
Let's go off the dome, I can't make it home
I fucked her, I boned her, she leave an aroma
They calling my phone up, my girl like "What's going on?"
She sucking, put me in a coma, I nut on that fish on my sofa

[Bridge: Young Thug]
Yeeeeeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Yeeeeeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Yeeeeeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
What's brackin'

[Verse 2: Lil Duke & Young Thug]
458 California 'Rari
I got that old money, call it Atari
Let's go off the dome, I trap by the Dome
Keep a couple grams in my fifth pocket
Keep a pocket rocket on me
Ain't no guessing if I'm gon' pop it
Got a lot of blood homies
And guess what it ain't no stopping
Hop in the car and I'm wyling, I'm styling
I hop out and cuss out my driver
Fuck nigga try me, no Eddie Bauer
I'ma pull up and make it rain, showers
I'ma lil kid when it come to that pussy
I hop up like the Icy Tower (hop up)
I would rather be a coyote than be a coward
I creep right up on them
Hit em with the AK, 7 in the morning (pew pew)No Christmas Eve
Caught him by surprise, he was still yawningI'm running the city
You riding in that loaner, I'm running with owners
I'm running with armor
I'm not even thinking I'm right off the dome

[Hook: Young Thug]
Let's go off the dome, I can't make it home
I fucked her, I boned her, she leave an aroma
They calling my phone up, my girl like "What's going on?"
She sucking, put me in a coma, I nut on that fish on my sofa

[Bridge: Young Thug]
Yeeeeeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Yeeeeeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Yeeeeeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
What's brackin'
