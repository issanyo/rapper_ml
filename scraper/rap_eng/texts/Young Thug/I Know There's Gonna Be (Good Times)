Good times, good times

Work every day 'til me meet ends
Haffi tun it up pon weekends
Buss a toast, be a real friend

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Good times, there's gon' be some good times
Remember we used to pull up and let 'em fight?

Remember I used to grab on that ass
When it was 'bout that wood time?
Yeah if that bitch walk up trippin' she get that mush time

Pop quiz, it's a pop quiz (pop it)
All my money comin' clean, you can't pop this (woah)
She got that pussy locked up like locksmith (damn)
Watch her come to my lights like a reindeer (ice)
Me and Papi on the same pills (Papi)
My diamonds could never stand still (no way)
Where you goin'? Can you come here? (come here, babe)
I'll always take you back for your sex appeal

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'ma ride in that pussy like a stroller
I'll survive in a mothafuckin' gutter (uh)
That's my mothafuckin' woadie, like the Nolia
And, and I'm comin' red like Coke-Cola
I'ma have a very good time
I swear to God I can't never sideline lil shorty (what you tell her?)
She say she likes all of a nigga rhymes
Where is my phone? That pussy callin'
I want you to pass it to Thugger Thugger
Even in the summer time me and lil shawty cuddle (woo)
I swear to God I'ma tip you, you don't got to struggle (ayy)
Baby girl sit it down, you not known like an usher (ayy)
I told lil' mama I don't bite but my teeth do
I wanna control you like voodoo
I'm steady screamin' free Unfunk and DuLu
Every time I have a good time Duke do too

[Pre-Chorus: Popcaan & The Persuasions]
Good time, ayy
Come have a good time, buss a bad wine
