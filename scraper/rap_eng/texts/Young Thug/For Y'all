Ahem, I said, you don't wanna walk a mile in my jeans
*Billboard Hitmakers*
Oh no, no (Ohh)
I get that green asparagus (yeah), bust it down with the team (yeah)
And we go shopping all day (yeah)
Whatever you want you cop it all day (all day)
Need like forty more credentials for the ladies (for the ladies)
All that hatred got 'em sittin' outside for ages
'90s baby, feel like I been gettin' it since the '80s

[Chorus: Young Thug & Jacquees]
Make sure everybody flossing, babe I'm saucy (yeah)
My Hublot blue when I'm making plays on Slauson (yeah yeah yeah)
Ayy, I'm makin' big ol' plays
Stackin' that Frito-Lay, just for my baby

[Verse 2: Young Thug, Jacquees & Both]
And I got racks on racks on racks, I'm goin' crazy
Flippin' these packs, these packs, bust it down, buy a whip, Miss Daisy (yeah yeah yeah)
Bust it down good, then give the shake to a J, ayy (uh huh)
Not T at all, we don't play it (ahh yeah)
I didn't write this song, I just went right in (right in)
I dropped the 'Vette off, it came back racin' (racin')
She down with me (down), gotta go'n face it (face it)
She sucked me to sleep, I can't replace it (oh woah)
Creepin', man stop, never get over me (woah)
Used me for steppin' stones, just know you owe me (ohh)
Everything Gwaluh, he ain't get no leak (ahh)
I fuck around smoke your partner, on your lil ho street (uhh)

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug & Jacquees]
Pussy never not wet (yeah), never got you upset (yeah)
Patty cake when that check hit (yeah)
For the fam it's Russian roulettes (yeah, oh yeah)
On the private jet countin' digits (woo!)
Red light, I'm drinkin' red (ya!)
Take care of everybody 'round me
And I live my life the rest
And I never forget to

[Chorus: Young Thug & Jacquees]
Make sure everybody flossing, babe I'm saucy (yeah)
My Hublot blue when I'm making plays on Slauson (yeah yeah yeah)

Stackin' that Frito-Lay, just for my baby

[Verse 3: Young Thug & Jacquees]
I did everything for y'all to ball
Tell y'all risked it all to see a smile on y'all (yeah)
I risked my future goals for all y'all (yeah)
I risked my life she told me take that condom off and go raw (oh yeah)
She perfect in my eyes, she know when I act modest (yeah)
Girl version of me, man this just works for me
She, she genius, she my idol, believe, yah
And y'all need any sneakin' she gon' peep it

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug & Jacquees]
Pussy never not wet, never got you upset (yeah yeah, what?)
Patty cake when that check hit (yeah)
For the fam it's Russian roulettes
On the private jet countin' benji's (oh yeah)
Red light, I'm drinkin' red (uh huh)
Take care of everybody 'round me
And I live my life at risk
And I never forget to

[Chorus: Young Thug & Jacquees]
Make sure everybody flossing (yeah), babe I'm saucy (I am)
My Hublot blue when I'm making plays on Slauson (on Slauson)
Ayy, I'm makin' big ol' plays
Stackin' that Frito-Lay, just for my baby
