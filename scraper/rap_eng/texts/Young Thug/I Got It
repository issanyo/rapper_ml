[Ca$h Out]
If a nigga want a whole brick we got it
We ain't getting money man, boy you need to stop it
Left pocket cheese cake right pocket sloppy
And everything we do man, we gotta make a profit
[Young Thug]
And these niggas flexin', tell them stop the flexin'
They ain't making cake serving pies
And all ain't block you can stop at the shop
And get yourself for one twenty-fives

[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]
It's over, yeah I think it's my time
Dank super-whip, my Chevy done took the high dive
Sold so many chickens you would think I worked at Popeyes
My plug is a mystery, you should have been on MyTime
Cuh serving a lifetime for tryna get this cash bitch
Shot-sucka, horny home, cuz I'm a money savage
Damn I got the cash cause I'm staring at the tits and shit
Just chilling in my mansion, my plug calling from Mexico
Walk slow loaded like [?], my partnas they some goblins
They gotta call me Batman cause my partna them be robbin'
I'm the man of the year, see the man up in here
See me walking with these karats, I'm a walking chandelier
(She got it)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
You know I throw the work in the kitchen just like mouse
I'm talking real shit and I think I need to floss
You know I'm reading up on the first and the fourth
I had to throw my Glock, on July the fourth
I gotta ball hard, you can call me the shop
Swag earrings in my ears, but we call the blocks
But you know them white-white, yellow box in flock
Plus the maid cost ten, so it's not a fox
And yes guys, this is only round one
And I already killed a nigga without the gun (Yes I did)
So yes, I can kill a nigga without the gun (He dead!)
He planned to kill you when they whip out the gun

[Hook] + [Loud Ass Cough]

[Verse 3: Ca$h Out]
I well did, I got a lot of cash
I keep my money in them Gucci, Luis product bags
When we go on shopping sprees, ain't no need to check the tags
I'm living life fabolous, you can throw it in the bag
Riding in the Audi truck with throwaway gats
I put my team up cause I got throwaway packs
When we hit the club dawg, we got throwaway racks
Earrings on HD, VVS, in the flesh
These niggas talking sex, I got my check up
The ice got me sick, I think I need a check up
Yo girl in a Lambo, she be with a nigga
Saying how she finna leave a man, you need to step up
