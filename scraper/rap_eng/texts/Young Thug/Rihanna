So used to whippin Madonna
Cookin' up like Benihana

Then I go flex in designer

Hunnid bands for them bitches
Hunnid rounds for them niggas
Riding foreign like a rental

If she ain't down when I come around
Young nigga ain't fuckin' with her
I just got me a Rihanna
So used to whippin' Madonna

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
So many watches they think I'm a jeweler
But I'm just obsessed with the time (Obsessed)
When I go so hard like everyday like I'm broke
But I'm just in love with the grind (I AM)

And I want a brand new Bugatti (Gatti)

And I got that Katy Perry and Madonna

She was there when I had nothing
She kept it loyal forever

And never turn down for nothing
She know I get to the money
She never trip off the money
She my lil’ soldier forever
She kept it loyal forever
I just got me a Rihanna
