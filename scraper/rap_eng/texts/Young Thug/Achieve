[Intro: Teezie Dolla]
Hey Thug, what they say homie?
Check this out right, bein' broke, that's bad for my health, right?
I got so much of this shit, I signed myself
All I want you to do right now, I want you to talk to these folk
And tell 'em how I really live, right?
Cause we havin' so much money right now...

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
And I'm Su Woo but I wrote this with a blue pen
And this the movement, please join in
And they like "Thug really do this"
And I'm lucky to tell ya'll this the blueprint
And I wonder why they hatin' on me
I guess the ice got they main bitches skatin' on me
Maybe my car cause the next year's datin's on it
TIP, I'm a young king, please put the cape on me
Thug go in, curfew
I'm on a lot of tracks, they say the Thug startin' to irk you
And ya'll eatin' shit that's baby food, burp you
If Wayne flow is kush, then my shit is on purple
But my flow is sick, it's dyin', I need a donor
And I'm so great, when I leave I need a corner
I didn't ride a wheel so that Phantom gone need an owner
And your ho be totally screamin' she's not a moaner
I told Wayne I was ready for the paper like Usher
He said cool, sit back, stay away from busters
Now Thug got the big head, I am a gusher
I am not the best but I am better than others

[Hook: Young Thug]
And I know you believe in me
And I'm at the top you shall achieve with me
And I'm not gonna stop so you'll succeed with me
I have your body frozen, your degrees with me
And I know you believe in me
And I know, you know, I know you'll succeed with me
And I know, you know, I know you'll achieve with me
I have your body frozen, nigga freeze with me

[Verse 2: Teezie Dolla]
I'm at the tip top, ain't no toppin' me
I want the whole thing, now watch me re-rock a key
And I ain't wanna flex, so I called bee-bee
Sippin' on this mud got me bobbin' and leanin'
I hopped out the porch just like Skooly
Me and Young Thug on this one, it's a movie
Pull up in that drop head, mouths drop like droopy
Now they sayin' I got the big head like Stewie
I took a break from the rap for a reason
Now I ride drop head flyin' down Cleveland
Whoever thought me and my crew be ridin' horses
Paneramic car, that mean back to back Porsches
They said I fell off cause I ain't brought the new whip through
But when I bring it back, I'ma paint that bitch crip blue
And still post up on the ave with my boy big blue
And a hundred young niggas and they all screamin' Su Woo
I went to church just to chill in the pulpit
And Mario got shot, yea that's still some bullshit
But Thug, I can't let it handle you
I'mma take you off to Cleveland, aka the Zoo

[Bridge: Young Thug]
And my bitch look like a barbie
I have a new spot, Houston no Marcus
Nigga you don't wanna start it
Lil Tee bring the troops, we the sergeants
Ride the beat like a ROC crew Harley
And if ya'll ballin' with the bands we Spalding
Bet a couple M's and I'm all in
And I'm so high, in 10 days I still be fallin'

[Hook: Young Thug]
And I know you believe in me
And I'm at the top you shall achieve with me
And I'm not gonna stop so you'll succeed with me
I have your body frozen, your degrees with me
And I know you believe in me
And I know, you know, I know you'll succeed with me
And I know, you know, I know you'll achieve with me
I have your body frozen, nigga freeze with me

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Yea, and I'm the motherfuckin' realest
And any nigga hear about me they say Young the fuckin' illest
And ya'll motherfuckers brainless, no ceilings
Bought the new Bentley coupe, the roof I had to fuckin' kill it
Bought my bitch the new Audi, we have to switch cause I like it
When I don't like to drive, we bought the jet so I can fly it
They say I'm sexy but the face look kinda mean so don't fright it
And niggas know I'm shootin', they say they don't? Then they lyin'
And if they say they shot back they a front
The only niggas shot that was the rats
So shoutout to the rats
I'm the realest, no front
I'm sorry I had to kick it like a punt, yeah

[Hook: Young Thug]
And I know you believe in me
And I'm at the top you will succeed with me
And I'm not gonna stop so you'll succeed with me
I have your body frozen, your degrees with me
And I know you believe in me
And I know, you know, I know you'll succeed with me
And I know, you know, I know you'll achieve with me
I have your body frozen, nigga freeze with me
