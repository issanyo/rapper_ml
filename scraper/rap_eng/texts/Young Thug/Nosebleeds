[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Uh, let me take these niggas back, slatt, slatt
Have to be natural nigga got, slatt, slatt
'Bout to pull in the hood, they respect, 'spect
You should know I never did it, yeah, slatt, slatt

I done ran it up, a nigga [?] like the [?]
Most these bitches half of a million horses like slatt, slatt
I whipped a million horses, yeah, slatt, slatt

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm in the nosebleed, not the coach seat, oh yeah (oh yeah yeah)
Got this gold on like trophy, oh yeah

Pop the seal on the codeine clingin', oh yeah

[Verse 1: Reese LAFLARE]
I'm so high now (I'm so high)
Out my mind now (out my mind)
Bring them vibes out (bring them vibes)
Bring them slimes out (bring them slimes)
In the clouds now, see it in my eyes now (in my eyes now)
In the field now, fuck it how you feel now (fuck it how you feel)
Ayy, yeah I'm the real (yeah I'm the real)
These niggas ain't real (niggas ain't real)
Fuck all that cap (fuck all that cap)
Niggas is actors (niggas is actors)
They livin' backwards (they livin' backwards)
The engine in the trunk (engine the trunk)
I ride it backwards (I ride it backwards)
She rode that dick like a rollercoaster
I want that head and I motorboat her
They pour up in Fantas, no other sodas
My neck is on ice and it's plenty frozen
Flare on the rise and you snoozin'
Still rockin' my Vans and my Ksubis
Hang with the slimes out the sewer
King of the youth and I'm rulin'

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Uh, let me take these niggas back, slatt, slatt
Have to be natural nigga got, slatt, slatt
'Bout to pull in the hood, they respect, 'spect

Pop the seal on the codeine clingin', oh yeah

[Verse 2: Reese LAFLARE]
Let's skate out the top row, get it jumpin'
Higher than the nosebleeds now
You ain't got no drip, I'll sell you some
Never sold but smoke until we numb
'Bout go go gas in the coupe (gas)
Roof wanna do alley-oops (woo)
Call up, I'm tellin' my slimes, slatt
Know that we comin' with troops (slime)
Dolly, Dora, Gunna too, nigga
Bet that, we on go, nigga (skate)
Never built up with ho, nigga
If you came with pussies, know you goin' with 'em
Big ice know it's all below degrees (all below degrees, woah)
Your bitch suckin' and it's below the knees (know she fuck and suck, suck)
Red Bentley coupe, that's a real big B (skrr)
And I been had it, ain't shit been sweet (slatt, slatt)

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Uh, let me take these niggas back, slatt, slatt
