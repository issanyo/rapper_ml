[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah
Southside
Yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
All my life, I showed you
Ran it up on you and showed you
Yeah, I put ice on you, I glowed you
Yeah, your partner them get rolled too
I was taught to get that stick and go and bleed on them
Nigga came straight from the bottom now I got m&ms
And these niggas don't want no smoke, I see police in them, dog
And all my life I'm 'posed to show you and show you

[Verse 1: Future]
Pockets stretched out like I got a barrel on me
I'm so Pluto, out of reach, can't come close to me
YSL, Bleaveland Ave, boy I bleed with them
Gun smoke in the air, blow that heat with them
All my life, I been a hustler and I showed you (and I showed you)
I got 10 whips outside and they showed you (ha, ha, ha)
I put a Rover in the pot and took it global (ha, ha, ha)
I get a whip imported out, come fully loaded (I'm so loaded)
I got some money, bought medallions
That bitch so bad, we call her stallion
Gotta put more zips inside the styrofoam
Fucked up your budget on one stone
You get so rich, they try to treat you like a outsider
I ran it up, they try to find a way to criticize it
Selling dope and juugin taking I ain't forgot about it
I became a legend in the streets there ain't no spit around me

[Chorus: Young Thug & Future]
All my life, I showed you (man, I showed you)
Ran it up on you and showed you (man, I showed you)
Yeah, I put ice on you, I glowed you (I put ice on you)
Yeah, your partner them get rolled too (man, your partner get the [?])
I was taught to get that stick and go and bleed on them
Nigga came straight from the bottom now I got m&ms
And these niggas don't want no smoke, I see police in them, dog
And all my life I'm 'posed to show you and show you

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Trap nigga, better have a test-speed on 'em
Bentley truck outside, he got a big B on him
The glacier on my finger cost me ten keys, Alicia
Dogs got the pet store boomin'
Baby, don't you move, I'll invest in your moves
Baby, watch me move, watch me Michael Jackson move
Billy Jean move, Bill Jean truth
Pocket rock inside of me
I just wanna know the money talk, Charlie Sheen
I just noticed all the bad bitches followin' (I noticed)
With a clear rearview, I see a lotta niggas followin' me
I see a lotta niggas broke, also loud as me
I see a lotta niggas try, but don't stick out like me
And if the monkey niggas died, you can't compare with me
An' when I'm in my stride, he can't bear with me

[Chorus: Young Thug & Future]
All my life, I showed you (all my life, I showed you)
Ran it up on you and showed you (ran it up on you, I showed you)
Yeah, I put ice on you, I glowed you (I put ice on you)
Yeah, your partner them get rolled too (yeah, yeah)
I was taught to get that stick and go and bleed on them (yeah, yeah)
Nigga came straight from the bottom now I got m&ms (yeah)
And these niggas don't want no smoke, I see police in them, dog (po-po)
And all my life I'm 'posed to show you and show you
