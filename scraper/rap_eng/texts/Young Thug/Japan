[Chorus]
Got some racks in my bag, racks in my pants, yeah
Take a flight to Japan, had to take a xan, yeah
Got a cool new swag but my drip gon' drag, yeah
I'mma jump in that Lamb', drive it fast, yeah

[Verse 1]
I can't lie I'm on it
I just fucked your bitch this morning
Only when she call me she horny
Slam dunk in your bitch like Jordan
Got some venom from the slime, she poisoned
Sit the Bentley on some offset Forgi's
Then I gave some racks to my main man
Benjamin Franklin my best friend
Who choosing on a nigga 'fore I came in
I ain't doing this shit for no fame man
The Benz got a panorama roof in it
'17 coupe fit two in it
Got your wrist turnin' up so I'm a lieutenant
Young Gunna Gunna I'm authentic
Drip in some Gucci all white linen
I'm finna take off give me one minute
Me and my bro going to London
Blue cheese on me, all hunnids
Hope you pussies paying homage
Got lean flowing down to my stomach
Pop a X pill to kill my conscience
I was sleeping at the bottom of the dungeon
Right before I had my funds then
And they let me walk through with my gun in

[Chorus]
Got some racks in my bag, racks in my pants, yeah
Take a flight to Japan, had to take a xan, yeah
Got a cool new swag but my drip gon' drag, yeah
I'mma jump in that Lamb', drive it fast, yeah

[Verse 2]
Pour a four of turbid, take it to the head
Got two bitches laying in my bed
Like giraffe baby gimme that neck
Z06 connect top on that 'Vette
Fishtailing and I almost wrecked
These are VVS nigga, these baguettes
That's a diamond that'll leave a nigga wet
That's a chopper that'll put 'em on a stretcher
2500 for a double seal of act
'Nother lil' 100 for a glass, paint it red too
This some shit I got used too
Most of these hoes I done ran through
He tripped right over like a loose shoe
Bitch must thought she was new new
Sold that hoe like my old school
Pull to the hood I was one deep
You can check the tag, ain't nun' cheap
Got frames on my face cause I'm too geeked
I got yo bitch on a loose leaf
Every time I come through it's a movie
Got a drip make a dime say, "Who is he?"
Got rack in the room, she turn to a freak
Put pipe in the Adam, went way too deep
Don't see me, you can't relate to me

[Chorus]
Got some racks in my bag, racks in my pants, yeah
Take a flight to Japan, had to take a xan, yeah
Got a cool new swag but my drip gon' drag, yeah
I'mma jump in that Lamb', drive it fast, yeah
Got some racks in my bag, racks in my pants, yeah
Take a flight to Japan, had to take a xan, yeah
Got a cool new swag but my drip gon' drag, yeah
I'mma jump in that Lamb', drive it fast, yeah
