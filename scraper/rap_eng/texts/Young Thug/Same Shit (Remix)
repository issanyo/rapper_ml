[Intro: Young Thug]
I woke up this morning
I noticed I was one of the biggest *****s in America
So I called up my bro and said
"Can I get on the remix?"
He was like "Sure"
So listen

[Hook]
Money on my mind so when I speak I might talk a tech
Bazillion pairs aka Paris, I'm like where to next
Bugatti around my neck, ay, bought that just to flex, ay
I hate the rules so much I tossed them breads on that big life
They ain't on that same shit, ay
I'm like they ain't on that same shit, ay
I'm like they ain't on that same shit
They ain't on that same shit
They ain't on that same shit, give a fuck who you came with

[Verse 1: Maserati Black]
Black Bugatti Maserati get it for the low
Lip stick around my dick I get it from your ho
I blow that humble Cali bud from the west coast
Oh, I might pull up in that holy ghost
Just accept this, that pussy taste like Pepsi
Been rocking side chick, Maschino and Cavalli
I ain't on that bullshit, boy, I'm on your dick
You wanna burst from the kid it's gonna cost a brick

[Hook]
Money on my mind so when I speak I might talk a tech
Bazillion pairs aka Paris, I'm like where to next

They ain't on that same shit, ay
I'm like they ain't on that same shit, ay
I'm like they ain't on that same shit
They ain't on that same shit
They ain't on that same shit, give a fuck who you came with

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Uhh, Thugger, stoner! (rrrat!!)
I might pull up in the Range, I might hop out of the Range
I put Birkin on her ring, VVSs in my chain
Bitches get lower, get lower, get lower
These bitches just wanna get lower
I came in your partner and I took me some soda
Then I turned it into Coca Cola
She had to tow it with them birds [?] quarters
Valet parking bending over, I pull up on charges
Nigga tryna play my brodie, I pull up and load ya
Everytime I start her I'm on that pull up and fuck shit
Yeah, I show them ratchets to bend over for it
Your old man boy, I rock Tom Ford

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Straight Drop]

Louis V's cost two a piece, Cavalli's all in my smoke
Bad bitches and they no drop, getting in, putting in work
Two story, yeah, I pull it out, strap up and pussy I murk

Got more money than your fucking vault
Little homie you're lost, better get you something
