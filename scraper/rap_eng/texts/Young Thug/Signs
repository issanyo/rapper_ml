[Intro]
Put your signs in his face
Gang signs in his face

[Verse 1 Bloody Jay]
Big B's in his face
Nigga play, we gone shoot up this whole place
D.O.A
Dead on arrival
I'm headed for our rivals
Get crossed up no bibles
We bleeding no towels
Fuck them, the world's ours
Two guns up like the twin towers
Flamed up like twin towers
Fuck niggas getting devoured
Niggas wish they was us
That's why they niggas sour
Pussy nigga tell the tale
They ain't nothing but some cowards
Sex money murder nigga that's my game
All my niggas with me yeah we rep the same thing
Got some homies in the G (?) that's the bang gang
Blood in blood out we always gang bang

[Hook: Bloody Jay]
We bang we bang we bang (ros√©)
Gangbanging, we banging (got plans)
We bang we bang we bang (fuck you and your man)
Gangbanging, we banging
We bang we bang we bang (we bang)
Gangbanging, [B's up] we banging [B's up]
We bang we bang we bang
Gangbanging, we banging

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
B-L-O-O-D-Y thug thug
In the back of the... nigga doing drive-bys
Nigga still don't know about Bloody J are gonna die
Nigga still don't know about King Slime I will Fry
Blood Rich Gang run with pistols like utensils
YSL we'll just beat you like instrumentals
ROB got that tattooed on my temple
Blood Rich in the club with that 25 like Christmas
All I know is red, we've been like that since the 90's
Wrap my money up and told the feds to come and find me
5:55 now that's what you call perfect timing
A110 YSL stand behind me

[Hook]
