[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Blatt! Blatt! Blatt! Jeeee~
I make the pop flip
I'm stacking my chips
Like I'm in Vegas
She gotta have hips
Ain't fucking no RIP
My car is the latest
My pockets on blimp
I'm pissing out zips
My kids are lazy

Keys all on my cars
I shine like a star
I'm higher than Mars, ohh
My jewelry is winning, no poo
And this street shit is in me, Ryu

I got tats on my fore arms
I smoke more trees than a Palm
Hey and I'm......blowing, no bomb
That FN I got is bout loud as a car alarm

[Hook: Money Man]
I told her jump inside the bed
I told her open up ya legs
I told her come and use ya head
These niggas beefing over bread
These niggas talking to the Feds
I just go burn a pound of Meds
I buy a brick and shake a leg
I had to go and get it out the mud
I had to turn myself in to a plug
Ain't nobody want to show me love
I had to crawl out from the slums
I cut half these niggas off
Cause half these niggas too soft
I had to bounce back when I lost
Ran it up now a nigga on me

[Verse 2: Money Man]
I went to Arizona for a minute
Buy the boy just a cheaper ticket
Baby girl let a plug hit it
I'm a beast when them drugs in me
I'm with the growers out at Cali
They just be tossing bags at me
These niggas use to laugh at me
Now these bitches throwing ass at me
Ain't have a shoulder to lean on
Ain't have an OG to put me on
Ran up a hundred thousand on my own
Ran up a hundred thousand from the strong
I'm kicking bitches out the coupe
I'm giving speeches to the troops
Grab the F n N and let it loose
I just can't snitch on my connect
I just can't go for disrespect
Pour a 40 ease all the stress
Don't make me break a little nigga neck
Streets turning a nigga to a monster
Swear to god a nigga eating Lobster
I keep a cart by all the robbers
That's a hundred rounds for all my problems

[Hook: Money Man]
I told her jump inside the bed
I told her open up ya legs
I told her come and use ya head
These niggas beefing over bread
These niggas talking to the Feds
I just go burn a pound of Meds
I buy a brick and shake a leg
I had to go and get it out the mud
I had to turn myself in to a plug
Ain't nobody want to show me love
I had to crawl out from the slums
I cut half these niggas off
Cause half these niggas too soft
I had to bounce back when I lost
Ran it up now a nigga on me
