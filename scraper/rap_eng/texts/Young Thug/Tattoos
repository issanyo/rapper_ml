Ten racks, on rollies too
Ten racks, I'm bloody too
Ten racks I give you two
Ten racks, I need a few
Ten racks, gon' pay my dues

[Verse 1]
Don't like your middle man
Boat life like Gilligan
I push the ceiling in
None of you trill as him
I done went brazy
Talk about equations
Penthouse a play pen
Boolin' I'm lazy
I done bought so many mollies, I'm in Michigan
Put my hoe friend out the spot, you know she listening
And I might be in some trouble if she mention it
I might get a bitch a band, just to look at them
I done iced out my gold rollie
It look better than a trophy
And these bitches conniving, I know all these bitches want me
They gon' fuck my lil homie, yeah, yeah, they bogus
I'mma pull out screaming hokey pokey okey

[Verse 2]
Take out some time and just count it
I don't like old schools, I'm not mounted
YSL, bitch, I'm the founder
Suck dick and get an allowance
What do they know about my swag?
How many bands in my bag?
Bitten and curbing the style
Fifty-six thousand on cabs
Paid for my taxes I did not have to cheat
I am no Beyonce but I'm a big B
I got extendos, not talking no tees
You smoking Indo, don't stand next to me
I get my weed from Snoop Dogg, it's OG, yeah
Money still growing on trees, yeah
Rich nigga ride with police, yeah
Won't jeopardize none of these pieces, yeah
