[Intro: Moneybagg Yo & Young Thug]
I don't know what kinda shit I'm on right now
Yeah, I got my nigga Zach with me, you know what I'm saying? Right now
Yeah
ATL Jacob
One time I had a show, got damn
I was late, that nigga let me get his jet
You know what I'm saying?
Real boss shit, rich nigga shit
You know what I'm saying?

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I Patek that, 100 on a bust down
You ain't gang, set, nigga stay the fuck from 'round (slatt)
Baby graduated (how?)
She gave me cap and gown (cap and gown)
It was fye, fye (what that mean?)
That mean she busted down (ugh)
Murder, murder ain't a issue, I got hitters behind me (hitters)
I just skrrt, skrrt off the lot and ain't nobody co-sign it (gone)
I just did a couple drugs, now I'm sitting next to the pilot
Still might catch me in the trenches with that sack like a lineman

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo & Young Thug]
Niggas stressed, bitches pressed
I'm a major factor
I'm coming through with that juice, drippin' kiwi Snapple (spill)
Out with the old, in with the new
I'm replacing rappers (bye bye)
Liar, liar, pants on fire
You a big ol' capper (no cap)
She wanna fuck all night
Give her that bust down pipe (ugh)
I pour a four at least (then)
Name it a bust down sprite (lingo)
Your ice don't stand up (nope)
It wasn't bust down right (nope)
Iced out Jesus piece, I even bust down Christ
Ain't wore the AP in so long, I barely recognize it
Can't tell the time, you blinded
I'm with Slatt, we sliming (slime)
My lil' niggas them go live, live
Jimmy Fallon (litty)
Tote big racks, them big facts
You niggas minimizing (mini)

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo & Young Thug]
I Patek that, 100 on a bust down
You ain't gang, set, nigga stay the fuck from 'round (slatt)
Baby graduated (how?)
She gave me cap and gown (cap and gown)
It was fye, fye (what that mean?)
That mean she busted down (ugh)
Murder, murder ain't a issue, I got hitters behind me (hitters)
I just skrrt, skrrt off the lot and ain't nobody co-sign it (gone)
I just did a couple drugs, now I'm sitting next to the pilot
Still might catch me in the trenches with that sack like a lineman (sex)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I put Chanel runners, on her tippy toes
I went Lil Baby on her, except the figure four (ain't doing no nelson)
When birds were 40 racks, I was charging 20 a piece
Yeah, yeah, I had buck, like I'm from Tennessee
I drink a certain quart, then I go Billie Jean
Jimmy Choo[?]
I got a cooling system, but my diamonds [?]
Seven bitches with me now, you call me Kaepernick
I got that [?], [?]
I got my new, new, new, you see my Patek here
I get fed up with my laces, but my races, yeah
Lotta 3's like Miller with the Pacers, yeah

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I Patek that, 100 on a bust down
You ain't gang, set, nigga stay the fuck from 'round (slatt)
Baby graduated (how?)
She gave me cap and gown (cap and gown)
It was fye, fye (what that mean?)
That mean she busted down (ugh)
Murder, murder ain't a issue, I got hitters behind me (hitters)
I just skrrt, skrrt off the lot and ain't nobody co-sign it (gone)
I just did a couple drugs, now I'm sitting next to the pilot
Still might catch me in the trenches with that sack like a lineman (sack on me)
