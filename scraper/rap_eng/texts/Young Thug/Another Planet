Mattazik Been Boomin Off Rip

[Hook: Rylo Rodriguez]
No stylist can style this shit, I drip, I'm on a whole 'nother planet
Slip backdoor back football, man I'm on a whole 'lotta Xannies
Huracan-can for the seats so bitch you gotta fuck on yo camera
Bae ho call me daddy but no I ain't her parent
Playin real slow and we play this shit you dig
Hoe say she ain't never had no dick this big
Remember them times we used to have nothin' at free
Scratch me a [?] on TV can't [?] (got tired of that shit)

[Verse 1: Rylo Rodriguez]
My mom had no job in years, got tired of her tears (tired of her tears)
Eviction notice on the front door everywhere that we lived (everywhere that we lived)
Four of us, one bedroom and that got no lock
Had to sleep together, couldn't make a Pallet 'cause the floor too hard
Boiling water in the morning, tryna have a bird bath 'fo I go to school
Free Rico and Boo, I remember the times I had to wear they old shoes
Owed it all to my momma, did it on my own, I ain't never had no daddy
Came home from Paris, ran up a new bag, and went and got her a mansion
I ain't even gotta post 'shit on my Instagram, I just wanna be happy
Got a lotta money and I ain't even gon' spend it, 'cause I ain't never had shit
I was sittin' in the prison, they ain't send a penny, they was just last year
Now I got me and they tryna get all in my business, ride straight past 'em

[Hook: Rylo Rodriguez]
No stylist can style this shit, I drip, I'm on a whole 'nother planet

Huracan-can for the seats so bitch you gotta fuck on yo camera
Bae ho call me daddy but no I ain't her parent
Playin real slow and we play this shit you dig
Hoe say she ain't never had no dick this big
Remember them times we used to have nothin' at free
Scratch me a [?] on TV can't [?] (got tired of that shit)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
All that money on my mind like I gotta bald head
Ice box coups and I'ma chop the wig
After that he looked like [?] he had another bid
Cuban link drippin' like it's ink, gon' chop it on the [?]
I can give everybody a thousand at wireless
I'ma drown 'em with the champagne like I'm papi
Yeah yeah, my ring and my chain they both from 'round
So many cars, can't let the garage down, yeah yeah
I get a rush and you can feel it
I told that girl she can get with it
Ten times ten with the wrist (whoo)
I'm world medal, fakin', piece, god-damnit
Yo styler can trust this shit, this drip on a whole 'nother planet

[Hook: Rylo Rodriguez]

[Verse 3: Rylo Rodriguez]
Huracan, Tesla, Porsche or shit, I'm on a whole lotta speed
Rollie got 41-pointers lil brother, no I ain't in the lead
I still make that bitch pull up even if she bleed
Ain't none wrong with yo throat lil' ho, get on yo knees
On Aderall countin' that paper, I don't need no money machine
That [?] got salt on it like a plate of that cheese (so flawless)

[Verse 4: Lil Baby]
If the Feds at the door right now, my nigga gon' claim that stick
Lil freak from the hood sucked dick in the car with a whole lotta spit
Putting money on yo head like a bald head bitch with a brand new wig
In [?], met the plug every week, that's a whole lotta weed
New traphouse G's, 200 on the dash, that's a whole lotta speed
We were still gettin' frisked when [?] what we had, that's a whole lotta swag
Thirteen years old, we were breakin' in houses, we were livin too fast
I was raised by my momma, ain't had no father so the streets my dad
We had chopper way back then, when [?] stole it from his sisters'  boyfriend
Now that lil nigga got like plus a hundred, whenever he need me, he know that I'm comin'
Meet his sister every month with the money, they gon' go hard, but we go the dumbest
Sticks with the beams like we the [?], I hold my pad, don't come out my hommie
That's why I sit in the house and I chill, I can't [?] nothin', I ran up a mill
Anything that you goin' through, just ask God, he gon' give you the strength
Baby witness everything real, I been rappin' for a year
Now look how God work, I got two mill for my deal
