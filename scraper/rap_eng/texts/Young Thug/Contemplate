[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
Yeah
Ay Thug, you saying
[?]
But guess what, I got your back like you got mine
You know that?

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Should I fuck her or her best friend, I'm still contemplating
Should I drive the 'Rari or the Benz, I'm still contemplating
Shoot the .40 or the FN, I'm still contemplating
I'm a lil impatient but I never leave that money waiting
Should I fuck her and her best friend, I'm still contemplating
Should I drive the 'Rari or the Benz, I'm still contemplating
Shoot that .40 or that FN, I'm still contemplating
I'm a lil impatient but I never leave that money waiting

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Never leave the money waitin', run it up for your mamma's sake
Commas all I conversate, money come 100 ways
I will nickel and then dime it, every corner played
100 rounds on the K, 100 niggas on the way
If you get wrong, it's your tongue that I'm gon' get
I'm a dog, you the bone that I'm gon' get
Left you 'lone, now she gone, she my bitch
Hey Thug, you want switch? Contemplating on which one I'm 'bout to hit
Which one I'm bout to work
And I don't care nothin' bout no Birkin bag, pick out a purse
And I don't give a fuck about who had you last cause I had you first
If you [?] for them 808s, throw you in the dirt
Still contemplating 'bout

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Should I fuck her or her best friend, I'm still contemplating
Should I drive the 'Rari or the Benz, I'm still contemplating
Shoot the .40 or the FN, I'm still contemplating
I'm a lil impatient but I never leave that money waiting
Should I fuck her and her best friend, I'm still contemplating
Should I drive the 'Rari or the Benz, I'm still contemplating
Shoot that .40 or that FN, I'm still contemplating
I'm a lil impatient but I never leave that money waiting

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'mma run it up for ya, jewelry water like a lake
Feed my dogs chow plates, buyin' Rollies, never late
Buyin' cars, temp plates, pink slip on the way
You can ask Kumatie, bought a hundred pair of J's
I might pull up with my nigga, I'm ready to pull the trigger
My pockets swole that's why I feel like JT The Bigga Figga
I'm bleedin' like the original pack of skittles
10,000 dollars worth of rings on my toes, no mistle
Walk inside the bank with the bands tell the teller "Don't look like that"
Nigga I just might do the remix and say don't get booked like that
But if you pullin' up on Bleveland for no fucking reason
We gon' rob your ass on sight, we ain't playing, that's teasing

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Should I fuck her or her best friend, I'm still contemplating
Should I drive the 'Rari or the Benz, I'm still contemplating
Shoot the .40 or the FN, I'm still contemplating
I'm a lil impatient but I never leave that money waiting
Should I fuck her and her best friend, I'm still contemplating
Should I drive the 'Rari or the Benz, I'm still contemplating
Shoot that .40 or that FN, I'm still contemplating
I'm a lil impatient but I never leave that money waiting
