[Hook: Shook Cheyano + Young Thug]
These highs take me away from a low energy
I keep my eyes on niggas tryna take it away from me
I'm lit, I'm lit, I'm lit
Nigga this is how we lit
These highs take me away from a low energy
I keep my eyes on niggas tryna take it away from me
I'm lit, I'm lit, I'm lit
Nigga this is how we lit

[Bridge: Shook Cheyano]
Take my mind, take my mind away
We gonna fly today
No lie you can't block the fade
Or stop what I'm tryna chase
(?) you ain't gonna take my soul
Livin' in this world can be so cold
Prayin' to the Lord just like momma told me
I break right through the mold and let the heavens hold me

[Verse 1: Shook Cheyano]
(?) from you
Look at this money, we made it
Ball NBA but we playin' no games
Cause we all about dollars, ain't never gon' change
Back and no slackin', we up like Viagra
Live in the future, this already happened
High all the time, baby think that I lost it
So what? (?) nigga don't cross us

[Hook: Shook Cheyano + Young Thug]
These highs take me away from a low energy
I keep my eyes on niggas tryna take it away from me
I'm lit, I'm lit, I'm lit
Nigga this is how we lit
These highs take me away from a low energy
I keep my eyes on niggas tryna take it away from me
I'm lit, I'm lit, I'm lit
Nigga this is how we lit

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'm lit like a bitch
Might fuck on her tits
One, two, three, I'm it
But I never go out like Mitch
You check out my Rollie?
You check out my timepiece?
I need like 18 rubbers
I just caught a nine piece
I'm so high I cannot come down
I make these bitches fuck my rounds
My diamonds all type of colors like a clown
Babies show me the plays just like a noun
Bout to kill it, raid the town
I'm rollin' Rollie not the pound
These bitches chase me like they hounds
Bend over like a center, touchdown
I could never keep it tight like a pantie
Wire bands on the back of panoramics
Take a zanny, comin' down, bae don't panic
Might as well take a new flight when you landed
Might as well fuck a new dick like a gremlin
Might as well suck a new bitch like your daddy
Might as well grip on the wood like a Caddie
Understand me?

Nigga this is how we lit
These highs take me away from a low energy

I'm lit, I'm lit, I'm lit

[Bridge 2: Shook Cheyano]
These highs got me lit, got me lit
These highs got me lit, got me lit
These highs got me lit, got me lit
If you lit light a flame up in this bitch, nigga

[Verse 3: Shook Cheyano]
Oh no you culture vulture
She ridin' this dick like a roller coaster
Disclosure, disclosure, I'm never sober
We get more exposure than naked posters
Devil on my shoulders, still they roarin' into stadiums
Angels on my cranium, tell them wings cavin' in
(?) on my brain again
You will never understand the place I'm in
Over (?) them
Double top smash fire like I'm really satan scream
We stacked your protection nobody gon' play your shit
You against me a hilarious discussion
I'm fuckin' your bitch to my record she bumpin' it
