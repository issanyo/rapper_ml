[Hook]
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, lord, lord
Oh lord, lord, lord

[Verse 1]
Oh, find me, oh lord
They need to free me, aye
Oh my, oh lord
Like I just seen a whole key
Diamonds work magic like a genie
Expensive, my fabric, don't need it
Your bitch, she got a butt-head, Beavis
You know I'm kickin' shit like Feely
I really want your cat, no kitty
If i ain't talkin' to you, no speakin'
You know a nigga Slime like the deacon
So, I'm only fucking you for the weekend
She said she need a hundred just to begin
Shawty wet, but she ain't a sea fish
Niggas stand in line for the pretest

[Hook]
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, lord, lord
Oh lord, lord, lord

[Verse 2]
Make your girl gimme that turtle neck
Stomach flat like "where that girdle at?"
100K can't fit where your purses at
Hundred bill come through the mail like where them purses at?
Hundred bitches boolin' on the dock
I done spend two hundred on the clock
Don't think I'm a jay when I wear rocks
Minks on the floor, I ain't need no socks

[Bridge]
They wanna take it there
They wanna what?
What they want?
They wanna take it there
Come on, come on already

[Hook]
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, lord, lord
Oh lord, lord, lord
