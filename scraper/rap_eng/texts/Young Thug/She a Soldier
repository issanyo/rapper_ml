[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Baby, whip that dope like I told you
Never let a nigga fuck you over
Stay down, I'mma put you in a Rover
You better never tell nobody what I showed you
You a soldier, you a soldier
Beauty in the eye of the beholder
She a wild alley cat, Villanova
I pray to God, da folks, don't pull her over
It ain't 'bout the sack, it's all about the soldier
I won't care less bout the money but my soldier
I lost a bomb, I lost the pack, I lost my soldier
She a down bitch, a motherfucking soldier

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
15K today, 30K tomorrow, nigga
I live life on boats, like I'm sponsored by nautica, nigga
Everything I say's a quote, I just took of them folks
Got a dope bag in my throat, I'm trying my best not to choke
We gonna chase that fucking paper to the ceiling
Zero tolerance for these bitches, they just want chillen
I made a pledge to Migo to take care all my nephews and nieces
Then ran into my Migo then turned to a fucking receiver
I'm receiving, you know I'm cricket like '
I'm a freak, I get the pack, and take all the clothes off they body
I know bitches, that gone come and fuck you and take all your riches
I know math well, me and Gucci spending nothing but digits, get it

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Baby, whip that dope like I told you
Never let a nigga fuck you over
Stay down, I'mma put you in a Rover
You better never tell nobody what I showed you
You a soldier, you a soldier
Beauty in the eye of the beholder
She a wild alley cat, Villanova
I pray to God, da folks, don't pull her over
It ain't 'bout the sack, it's all about the soldier
I won't care less bout the money but my soldier
I lost a bomb, I lost the pack, I lost my soldier
She a down bitch, a motherfucking soldier

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Now she been riding for a nigga for some years
Cried a river with all them tears, even aborted a couple kids
After I did that other bid, I thought you would've left me, I was down on my dick
But you were still there to help you, you the chef that kept me fed
You see, I ain't scared to say it, it was nothing, just to play it
So I was shooting for the head and I was moving from them feds
Watching every move and knowing whereabouts
Money I make more, fake hoes don't care about
It's like four niggas try to share a house, it ain't gone work, I make 'em tear it down
Get that eviction notice, grip the 40, might let them niggas have it
Scooter and Gucci, you know we causing havoc

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Baby, whip that dope like I told you
Never let a nigga fuck you over
Stay down, I'mma put you in a Rover
You better never tell nobody what I showed you
You a soldier, you a soldier
Beauty in the eye of the beholder
She a wild alley cat, Villanova
I pray to God, da folks, don't pull her over
It ain't 'bout the sack, it's all about the soldier
I won't care less bout the money but my soldier
I lost a bomb, I lost the pack, I lost my soldier
She a down bitch, a motherfucking soldier

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Stand and salute like I taught you to
Pistol in the purse like a soldier do
She got the brains and the body and the muscle too
I give a shout out to these bitches cause they hustlers, too
Soldier, soldier, baby girl a soldier
Pulled over, Corolla, she did what I told her
Don't give a damn if they send her ass to Angola
My girlfriend thick, lips look like Crayola
Severing ties, paying bribes, call this shit payola
Cocaina, Coca Cola, concealed with that Folgers
On Boulder-crest with OJ in yeah we got them boulders
I call that bitch lieutenant (....unintelligible...) because that bitch a soldier

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Baby, whip that dope like I told you
Never let a nigga fuck you over
Stay down, I'mma put you in a Rover
You better never tell nobody what I showed you
You a soldier, you a soldier
Beauty in the eye of the beholder
She a wild alley cat, Villanova
I pray to God, da folks, don't pull her over
It ain't 'bout the sack, it's all about the soldier
I won't care less bout the money but my soldier
I lost a bomb, I lost the pack, I lost my soldier
