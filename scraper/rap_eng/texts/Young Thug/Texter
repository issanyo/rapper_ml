[Bridge: Young Thug]
I cut in a motherfucker’s breath
80 chains sitting on my motherfucking dresser
I give you 500 but little D could go in lesser
All I  know is ride around with J’s, they the testers
Alligator crocodile with bumps, just like eczema
Black and white marble floors in the house like checkers
Gave her two bands inside of Lenox, that’s just my tender
And you know my jewelry sip of water
I spoil her, your daughter

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
She just want me down so we slide off four quarters
And we know how I chain like Marlboros, I love em
Fucked the girl once, and no call her, no bother
Plus I stole money from my mother and father
Call up MPA Duke and tell him pull up in the charger
500 deep the nigga mug, he might be retarded
I just hit a crip, bitch she think I play with the dodgers
Uncle Phil picked me up from Crim, I ridin on Marta

[Hook: Young Thug]
I got me a golden gun
I got me a golden gun
I still blow trust funds
I still blow trust funds
I throw a whole lot of ones
I throw a whole lot of ones
We fuck hoes by the groups
We don't do no ones

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Buy her a [?] just like Ricky
Two million dollars worth of land, just like Disney
OG swag for 5 years, nothin but chucks and dickies
All red Bentley, and that inside stuffed with bitches
On my way to Haiti (they love Haiti lingo)
All the cars foreign, little kids play bingo
Muntari Rashid, R.I.P. to Migo
All the boys in jail, free all of my people

[Hook: Young Thug]
I got me a golden gun
