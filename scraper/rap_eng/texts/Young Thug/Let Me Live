I just wanna fuckin live, I just wanna fuck a deal
I don't wanna get fuckin killed, I won't miss you for real (No way!)
Nigga get [?] fuckin marsh, nigga I ain't never been a target
If you gonna take my life tonight, put me in my mama garden, hey! (Imma duck)
That's god honest truth
If you take my life, you dun killed a real troop (pew pew)

Couldn’t really give a damn
