[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Yeah, it's Guwop! Big Gucci
(Honorable C.N.O.T.E.)
Go!

[Chorus: Young Thug & Gucci Mane]
Every time you see me, I'm a stoner (Yeah)
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her (Huh)
Every time you see me, I'm a stoner (It's big Gucci)
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her (Turn up)
I'm not stuntin' no bitches, they just want my children (Yeah)
Tear up her insides, that's sexual healin' (Squad)
I ride with that pumpkin, they carry the slugs
And I shoot in the sky, I'm gon' tear down the ceilin' (Let's go)
Every time you see me, I'm a stoner (Stoners, ha)
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her (1017, it's Guwop)
Every time you see me, I'm a stoner (It's Gucci, yeah)
Every time you see me, I'ma bone her (Huh, brr!)
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her
Every time she see me, I'm a stoner (It's Guwop)
Every time she see me, I'm a stoner (Guwop)
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
All I ride is Forgiatos, strip club, make an orgy out of
Porsches and Rolls Royces, I got choices, all my clothes designer (Damn)
Damn that belt is hard to find, Versace blanket, matching anklet
Pinky blangin', smokin' stankin', fall asleep but still drankin' (Leanin')
Guwop think he's something, he ain't he?
Look at the motherfuckin' car he came in (Catch up)
Look how wet his fuckin' paint is
I pour a deuce, he half a pint
His blunt big as Godzilla's fingers (Smoking)
1017 compulsive drinkers
If you cross that line, then your ass in danger
All I hang around is bangers (Gangstas)
I'm a gangsta', rollin' gangsta
Drive a Murciélago, dippin' blunts on camera (Uh)
Got a fist full of weed and she swallowin' my seed
But don't call her right now, 'cause the bitch can't answer
(That good head)
Got a double cup full of breast cancer (Drank)
I'm dropping my top like a dancer (Stripper)
These niggas play king, 'cause they king of the castle
But I'm the new king of Atlanta (Sheesh)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Every time you see me, I'm a stoner (I'm a stoner)
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her (I'ma bone her)
Every time you see me, I'm a stoner (I'm a stoner, nigga)
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her (Bone her, bone her)
I'm not stuntin' no bitches, they just want my children (Sheesh)
Tear up her insides, that's sexual healin' (Sheesh)
I ride with that pumpkin, they carry the slugs
And I shoot in the sky, I'm gon' tear down the ceilin'
Every time you see me, I'm a stoner (I'm a stoner)
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her (Stoner)
Every time you see me, I'm a stoner (Stoner)
Every time you see me, I'ma bone her (I'ma bone her)
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her (I'ma bone her)
Every time she see me, I'm a stoner (I'm high)
Every time she see me, I'm a stoner (I'm high)
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her (Bone)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I cash out on bitches, my weed smell like chitlins
These niggas don't really want problems (No way)
I come through your set with that carbon
Your children won't have them no father (Sheesh)
You know Young Thug's not gonna argue (He)
Got 500 rounds, I shoot longer (He)
I come out my shirt, these bitches know I'm tatted
Tattoo artist charged with arson (Skrrt)
Got one strapped to my knee (Yeah, yeah)
I spend racks on that lean (Spend racks on that lean)
I know I'm your bitch's dream (Know I'm your bitch dream)
She got a big cat, no kitty (Sheesh)
Young Thugga get high as a ceiling (Yee)
I'm the reason she tell you: “No feelings” (What?)
I know that you mad at her, she just wanna grab on us
And her teeth white like Alka Seltzer Plus (Damn)
I know she put me somewhere in her will (Yeah)
She want my pickle, you know we make deals (Yeah)
I pay her electric bill, eel
I need that lean, where is Phil? (Lean)
I want that lean, I need that lean (Yeah)
Promethazine, and that Codeine
That's Easter pink, that's Easter pink (Easter pink)
If I got none, I don't have no dreams (Sheesh)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Every time you see me, I'm a stoner (I'm a stoner)
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her (I'ma bone her)
Every time you see me, I'm a stoner (I'm a stoner, nigga)
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her (Bone her, bone her)
I'm not stuntin' no bitches, they just want my children (Sheesh)
Tear up her insides, that's sexual healin' (Sheesh)
I ride with that pumpkin, they carry the slugs
And I shoot in the sky, I'm gon' tear down the ceilin'
Every time you see me, I'm a stoner (I'm a stoner)
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her (Stoner)
Every time you see me, I'm a stoner (Stoner)
Every time you see me, I'ma bone her (I'ma bone her)
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her (I'ma bone her)
Every time she see me, I'm a stoner (I'm high)
Every time she see me, I'm a stoner (I'm high)
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her (Bone)
