[Verse 1]
Been a hot boy, 5-0-4
But I'm little Haiti's B-E-O
Bitch tried to fuck me first, no N-O
I be super dome first, no N-O
No kinfolk cause I fuck her til she turtle like Lorenzo
I don't play no games, not 'tendo
Niggas couldn't be me with a thugger scope
But on another note
I would like to marry your wife
But I wouldn't like to pay the price
That's why I think twice
Nah I think mice
So if you think once, I'll think thrice
You heard me?

[Hook]
Fuck your bitch and she ain't comin' back wodie
Got swag and a whole lotta cash wodie
I fuck your bitch and she ain't comin' back wodie
Got swag and a whole lotta cash wodie
Them niggas that behind me, they tote gats wodie
And them niggas that's behind me ain't the last wodie
Wodats turn up
Got gas burn up
Got cash throw up
Wodie
Wodats turn up
Got gas burn up
Got cash throw up

[Verse 2]
Pullin' up on Bleveland, might ruin your evenin'
We (?) like the cement, we be doin' achievement
Nat Nat bring it back, where you at oh dat?
These haters still up with it, give him cooties you stuck with it
Boss the iced out pieces
Gave me so I could bust with 'em
I only perform for cheese
My flyest go to Pizza Hut with 'em
I still eat at Mickey D's cause they got sluts in 'em
Nigga I caught your bitch on the street
She got a little mutt in her
And I'm gonna marry your wife
Just to make you think twice
And you won't look nice
You'se a mean faced bastard
But how you gone rush Casper?

[Hook]
Fuck your bitch and she ain't comin' back wodie
Got swag and a whole lotta cash wodie
I fuck your bitch and she ain't comin' back wodie
Got swag and a whole lotta cash wodie
Them niggas that behind me, they tote gats wodie
And them niggas that's behind me ain't the last wodie
Wodats turn up
Got gas burn up
Got cash throw up
Wodie
Wodats turn up
Got gas burn up
Got cash throw up
