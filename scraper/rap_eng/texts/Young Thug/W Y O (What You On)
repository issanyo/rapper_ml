[Intro: Young Thug]
Mike Willy with me, nigga
Thugger, Thugger, baby
I'm out in the booth eating candy and shit
Candy and shit
Can't get enough, Ransom
Can't get enough

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I cock back the stick and I aim at your dome
I say me a prayer then I send your ass home
No matter what, you can't take me off the throne
Ayy, I fuck with your shit but I don't know what you on

[Hook: Young Thug]
What you on? (Yeah, yeah)
What you on? (Yeah, yeah)
What you on?
Ayy, I fuck with your shit, but I don't know what you on (oh)
What you on? (Yeah, yeah)
What you on?
What you on?
Yeah, I fuck with your shit but I don't know what you on

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
That was a mistake
I didn't mean to say that ('scuse me)
I fuck on that bitch and she don't tell no one
I don't play that (shhh)
I’m real, I just told you
So you can know where your lil bae at (what?)
And if you ever play about that lil bitch
I’ll beat you like, where Zay at? (Do it)
They say no one do it better
More than geeked, up all et cetera (nah)
I fight with thousands of predators
I'm hungry, I want some competitors
And I still get fly like a pelican
I'm in LA, I want me some editors
Don't step on this landmine
I'm geeked out my mind on that mankind
But this stick, I'ma blast mine
Your bitch a tutor, you can class mine (she classy)
Chanel first, no, you can't last mine (nah)
Didn't I tell you 'bout that last time?
I'm eating so good, it's that crab time
I had me some cheese, yeah, I craft mine
Barter 6, nigga, Halftime, Halftime

[Chorus: Young Thug]
(Yeah) I cock back the stick and I aim at your dome
I say me a prayer then I send your ass home (bye)
No matter what, you can't take me off the throne (no)
Ayy, I fuck with your shit but I don't know what you on

[Hook: Young Thug]
What you on? (What you asking?)
What you on? (What you wan' do?)
What you on?
Ayy, I fuck with your shit, but I don't know what you on
What you on?
What you on? (Fuck is you on?)
What you on?
Yeah, I fuck with your shit, but I don't know what you on

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Pull up on a bitch in that foreign with exhaust
I just kicked that bitch up out my car and made her walk (get it)
No, I'm not from Texas, but I pull up kickin' sauce (ooh-wee)
Christmastime, I spent half a ticket for Jack Frost (fuck it)
I stuff that rental in a fender bender (yeah)
Bend that bitch over like center-center
Fuck the police, man, they tryna kill us (fuck 'em)
But I think they know that them slimes are killers (slime)
Yeah, I think they know that them slimes are thriller (know it)
The lots and lots, lots of niggas
Fuck 'em all, like we some thottie niggas (fuck 'em)
I need four wheels like a tri-cycle
Fuck on her friend and she know it, she know it
I bought a Jag' and then show it, then show it
'Cause I really love it, then do it to show it
Bought a G-Wag for my boys, my boys
Fuck a car note, I don’t owe no O
Lactose intolerant, bae, I'm spoiled, I'm spoiled
Take me some bars and take off to the stars
I done got so high, man, I think I see God (hey, baby)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I cock back the stick and I aim at your dome
I say me a prayer then I send your ass home (forget me)
No matter what, you can't take me off the throne (no)
Ayy, I fuck with your shit but I don't know what you on

[Hook: Young Thug]
What you on? (What you on?)
What you on? (What you on?)
What you on?
Ayy, I fuck with your shit but I don't know what you on (I don't)
What you on? (What are you on?)
What you on? (On)
What you on?
Yeah, I fuck with your shit but I don't know what you on

[Outro]
Pull up on a bitch in that foreign with exhausts
Pull up on a bitch in that foreign with exhausts
Pull up on a bitch in that foreign with exhausts
With exhausts, with exhausts
