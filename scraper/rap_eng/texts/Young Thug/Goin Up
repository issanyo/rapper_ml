[Intro: Young Thug & Lil Keed]
Yeah
Do you love me baby?
Like I love you baby
Keed
Yeah

[Chorus: Lil Keed]
Yeah, in that Bentley coupe doin' the whole thing
Throw that shit up to the roof, bitch we balling
Bring them bitches in the room if they all in
I spent so many racks on these pants, bitch I'm stylin'
Bitch I'm goin' up, bitches goin' down on me
Bitch I'm slowed up, I been drinking codeine
So much blue cheese in these pants, look like the money huggin' me
And when I hop off in the crowd they hold me way way up

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I put some bread in my pocket, Jimmy Dean
I add a rose gold chain when I drink my lean
I add Chanel on the rip of shawty's jeans (slatt)
I need a Tylenol, I popped too many beans
I'm at the VMA awards, now bring 'em out
I let the dentist with some braces in her mouth (tighten it up)
I told your darling, shawty was on south
I take this Rari, park it at the house
I tell her it stop it, call me and take this up
I told her to stop it, I got on my knees
I bought you the Rollie, you know it came forty-four B'd up, yeah
Cupid fishbowl is at the top
I put the tint on it (yeah), she tryna sit on it (yeah)
I can go the climax (what?), I got the deal on it, yeah
It came in wireless (what?), I spent a mill on it (yeah)
I'm smokin' on thrax pack, gotta keep the seal on it, yeah (that's kush)
You catch a body, gotta put appeal on it, yeah
I'm Prince Hakeem, straight out the trenches with it, yeah
I'm Bob Marley, the next century yeah
Hopped in with your boo
Wanna see chest up and then nothin' else

[Chorus: Lil Keed]
Yeah, in that Bentley coupe doin' the whole thing
Throw that shit up to the roof, bitch we balling
Bring them bitches in the room if they all in
I spent so many racks on these pants, bitch I'm stylin'
Bitch I'm goin' up, bitches goin' down on me
Bitch I'm slowed up, I been drinking codeine
So much blue cheese in these pants, look like the money huggin' me
And when I hop off in the crowd they hold me way way up

[Verse 2: Lil Keed]
AMG, Benz truck, we speedin'
Yeah she say she down, she just wanna be 'round me
Yes I'm havin' European denim on my bottom
I got niggas who won't squeal and they came straight from the bottom, yeah yeah
Sunset sherbert in my lungs
I rock out the show, count them racks in the morning
VVS diamonds, we havin' some pointers
Im boolin with slime, them snakes out the jungle
Neck flooded, you gon' need a plunger
I'm through with the hoe, she been passed around
I'm wiping his nose, we crossin' him out
All it take is one call, they surrounding your house

[Chorus: Lil Keed]
Yeah, in that Bentley coupe doin' the whole thing
Throw that shit up to the roof, bitch we balling
Bring them bitches in the room if they all in
I spent so many racks on these pants, bitch I'm stylin'
Bitch I'm goin' up, bitches goin' down on me
Bitch I'm slowed up, I been drinking codeine
So much blue cheese in these pants, look like the money huggin' me
And when I hop off in the crowd they hold me way way up

[Outro: Lil Keed & Young Thug]
Bitch I'm goin' up (do you love me baby?)
Bitch I'm slowed up (like I love you baby?)
Bitch I'm goin' up, bitches goin' down me  (do you love me baby?)
Bitch I'm slowed up, I been drinking codeine(like I love you baby?)
Do you love me baby?
Like I love you baby?
Do you love me baby?
Like I love you, yeah
