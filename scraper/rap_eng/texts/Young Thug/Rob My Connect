[Verse 1 – Young Thug]
Take off running down the street
Hood nigga ain’t getting nothing back
Run up on me, Imma hit him with the gat
Clap clap, slash slash
Nigga take over the prison, nigga take over the street
I hope you know that young thugga run off on anybody
I run off on me, and I ain’t lying, I ain’t lying
I ain’t lying, that's the truth
I’m a blood, my crew soo woo
This bitch with me, her nails blue
So I went and bought a bitch a pair of red shoes
And Imma train a bitch [?]
With the pills and the soft
And the weed and the lean and the molly, ay
She gon bring me all of em, no cost
No cost, no cost, no boss
Run off on you, then pull up and serve the boys
I ain’t scared nigga, I been busting cherries
Order up all em all, then I wait
Took off on em, nigga bout to force you [?], boys

[Hook – David Cash]
Think Imma rob my connect
Think Imma rob my connect
Ooh, get the money, get the money, get the loot
Told her get the yayo too
Shit open, young niggas gon shoot
Imma send them young niggas on through

[Verse 2 – David Cash]
Imma send them young niggas on through
Lil niggas ain’t got shit to do
Playing video games, sir I do
Send the racks on racks on through, they’ll do it for nothing
Do it for nothing, do it for nothing
They see me coming, pop be playing
We masked up, gunning, I kick in the front door
The back door, I know the spot with my eyes closed
Got a foreign bitch, she in a foreign
Get her front down, you ain’t even know it
Had a burner and you couldn’t get too it
Me imports, me exports, I got transports that wear Jansport
Nigga this sport ain’t sure sport
All the money in just like the [?]
Had a baby mom, was golden
He evil like the omen
Burners, Imma show me
Imma show me, this that show
This that show, this for sure
All duct taped, and blindfolded and gagged up with your 4
