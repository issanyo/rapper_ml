[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'ma learn my side effects cause you my project
Gotta keep a bald haircut i swear like my project
Gotta keep it wet for me, ayy
Got the cream on the seats, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's ridin' exotic cars, 'cause she's my baby
I put Rolls Royce stars in the ceiling and leave off Earth, yeah
Read my text when I see you like you supposed
I hate when you don't text me back, stop being a Barbie, wooh
Engraved your name in the seats in the Rolls
Backyard got a park, we ain't gotta leave home
When it comes down to you, I'll never say no
Like I'm supposed to, right?
Right? Right?
Make sure I tuck you in tight 'cause you don't like bugs at night, right?
Fur on your trench coat, you ain't even know I had to roll the dice for that
I put the straight-jacket on, go cray-cray for your love, yeah (hey!)

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Yeah, bought you brand new Fiji water, I wanna braid your hair
Bought Chanel shoes 'cause I wanna see them C's when you step
Got you new condominium keys, don't you go nowhere
And it's just us, dripped out love
Bentley coupe for you, paddy wagon'd it up
Flossin' in Belize, you a diamond in the rough
Christian Dior, love the smell of when we hug
The pain I get from you, I don't wanna go numb
Doin' overtime and develop us a bond
Straight-jacket on 'cause for you I go dumb
