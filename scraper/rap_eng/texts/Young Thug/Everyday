[Pre-Chorus]
I ran my money up now I'm Cazal living
You smell the kitchen, I'm whipping birds up and now you smell the kitchen
I cash out, I catch a nigga bitch and then I cash out
I smash off, I hop off in a coupe and then I smash off

[Chorus]
I just wanna fuck you everyday, baby, I just wanna fuck you everyday
I just wanna be high as a plane, baby, I just wanna be high as the rain
I just wanna throw all in the tank, baby, money ain’t a damn thing
I got racks, I don't complain, Mink coat look like it got mange

[Verse 1]
Chickens they come with the coupe, ooh, pull up on her then I poof, ooh
Bitch I'm a dog just like Snoop, ooh, droppin' my roof, ooh
If I point it I’m gon' shoot, who is my opponent, where are you? New
Jumanji code, you get bamboo
I'm stoned, no mountain, pour 4s in the deuce, yeah
I know you can't tell, I know you can't tell, pay my homies' way out of jail
The last ho I let get close and comfortable started calling me Lil Jeff
(Pshh, now that's scary)
Pass a lil baby a 40, she suck me loose and then she suck my brody loose
Passing her 'round and she come back around, just like currency come for the brew
I promise I don't give her any day off and she don't care about that she just swoop
I take my dick out and I nut in her mouth and surprise her with grams of the salt, aye

[Pre-Chorus]
Cazal pimping, I ran my money up now I'm Cazal living
You smell the kitchen, I'm whipping birds up and now you smell the kitchen
I cash out, I catch a nigga bitch and then I cash out
I smash off, I hop off in a coupe and then I smash off

[Chorus]
I just wanna fuck you everyday, baby, I just wanna fuck you everyday
I just wanna be high as a plane, baby, I just wanna be high as the rain
I just wanna throw all in the tank, baby, money ain’t a damn thing
I got racks, I don’t complain, Mink coat look like it got mange

[Verse 2]
Killing these niggas, killing these bitches too
She feeling me, nigga, I'm feeling these riches too
Arrogant motherfucker, 28 floors up, I can't see others
I spend them racks on lawyers for my brothers, feel sorry for others, ooh
DK sell you pies like custard, catch you in traffic, take off your jewelry
And sell it on Gresham, keep some of the diamonds, take it to Lucky
And get somethin' custom (Hey Lucky, hey Lucky), okay, okay, bool
He's a tacky motherfucker, so where's my brothers? My sisters?
I'm gonna fuck you and let him come pick you up, cause you a hooker
Sit in the mud like a worm and when you pull up, we gon' book ya
I'm living life like a shotgun but my pockets on fuller
And I got plans for all of them niggas that think they slick puller

[Pre-Chorus]
Cazal pimping, I ran my money up now I'm Cazal living
You smell the kitchen, I’m whipping birds up and now you smell the kitchen
I cash out, I catch a nigga bitch and then I cash out
I smash off, I hop off in a coupe and then I smash off

[Chorus]
I just wanna fuck you everyday, baby, I just wanna fuck you everyday
I just wanna be high as a plane, baby, I just wanna be high as the rain
I just wanna throw all in the tank, baby, money ain’t a damn thing
I got racks, I don’t complain, Mink coat look like it got mange
