[Verse]
Don't pay no dentures
I make a deaf n***a listen
RIP Benjamin Franklin
Had to tuck in the chain to a danglin'
RP truth, I was never a saint
Then my bitch and buy her, I'ma bang it
I had built this bitch up from the ground
[?] and I claimed it
Yeah
I just poured some drank and I mixed it

[Chorus]
With percocets and a addie
Money callin' momma phone 3 or 4 o'clock in morning
She don't answer
I got my chain out o' safe deposit, it was cold as a attic, wooh
I was drinkin' on [?], wooh

[Verse]
Kill it, crocodile, put it on a purse like a leopard, wooh
White car, peanut butter seats like a sandwich, yeah
Take the beef, turn the shit to pieces like Manwich
Yeah, I was born this shit
Nick says
Away from hittin' licks
N***a, yeah
I was [?], on the Crips
N***a, yeah
I could make him punch you in your lips
Pussy ass n***a, yeah
I could make him punch you in your lips

[Chorus]
With percocets and a addie
Money callin' momma phone 3 or 4 o'clock in morning
She don't answer
I got my chain out o' safe deposit, it was cold as a attic, wooh
I was drinkin' on [?], wooh
