[Hook: Young Thug]]
Got a thousand ways new dressing island
Me and Skooly ? em like a thousand islands
Thugger Thugger got cash steady piling
But a young crew steady wiling
Dive in, okay boo
Slime in, okay boo
Dive in, okay boo
Ok cool, ok cool

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Hickory, dickory, duck
I'm on my way to the motherfuckin' top, non-stop
I got all these bitches askin' when that album comin' out
I got plasmas in my roof, I'm askin' when they gonna drop
But they ain't
Cause I sold a lot of dope to keep my plug sane
My money turned into water, it'd be a flood this way
I'm sippin' on some lean that's thicker than mud in sun or something
I got so much lean in my blood you could cuff a body or some'
But this the movement, join in
And every week we swipe up, bowling pens
I love my X double L and Rock friends
Money makin' basketball players Coach Kidd

Got a thousand ways new dressing island
Me and Skooly ? em like a thousand islands
Thugger Thugger  got cash steady piling
But a young crew steady wiling
Dive in, okay boo
Slime in, okay boo
Dive in, okay boo
Ok cool, ok cool

[Verse 2: Skooly]
Up and on it, still movin' slowly
Pain so big, I got tears up to my shoulders
I'm unloading, fuck it I'm reloadin'
Bout to hop off in your bitch
She gone ride me like I'm stolen, ugh
Not an animal, a monster darlin'
Patrick Ewing, Michael Jordan ballin'
I'm hardly ballin'
That nigga better not play with the homies
But on that roster for the rastas homie
Send them rastas on ya
Never will I leave my brothers
Never will I leave my mother
Forever need my mother
I forever feed my brothers
I plant a seed they gonna feed the others
The streets, they love us
