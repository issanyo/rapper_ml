I done kept it real with the fake
I done did my thing fuck who hating
I can't take my kids on a date
Babymama's hating who I date
Babymama's hate who I can't hate
They mad cause my pockets ain't on pancakes
If they had the ups, they'll off my toupee
Even if I spent racks on their due dates
I can't understand these bitches
I can't understand these niggas
I can't understand why they trippin'
And they stacking all they money while I'm spending
I done spent a 100,000 tickets
I had em sleeping good while I hit licks
They looked they best while I looked stressed ayy
They looking healthy, I'm looking messy
I ain't never focused on my self bout nun'
I done put my whole family on my back
I ain't trusting nun' so the wall got my back
Leave a nigga tired, like a hog in a hatch
Go to war bout that
Nigga M.O.B bout that
Ain't no understanding...
Ain't saying sorry bout that
WOAWWW..
