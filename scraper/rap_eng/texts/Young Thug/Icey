[Refrain]
Yuh, la, la
It's just funny how I do you, ha-ah-ah
Richard Mille make 'em pukey, ah-ah-ah
Gotta a tiny booty hoochie, wah-wah-wah

[Chorus]
Woah, I told her she got a Thug wannabe
Woah, Demon Hellcat and I'm tearin' up the streets
Woah, I got a gun and a Patek on me
Woah, I tote a brand new bag on me
Woah, I beat the bitch up in Givenchy
Woah, I bought the stadium, won't need no seats
Woah, and I got cadence and real nice teeth
Woah, bitch, brown like cocoa, the real ice tea
Your Louboutin heels, you never gon' wear Nike's
I done left you for years, this shit still the same, I see
For now, I ain't stanin' no Nike's (oh, oh, oh)
My bitch is a Virgo but she actin' like a Pisces

[Verse 1]
Twist up, backwoods, not no Swishers switch up
We get up, fuck her every fucking weekend
Catch up, Calamari dinner with a cougar
Woah-woah, I'ma fuck her 'til she's purple Hoover
What up? You can't waste none of my time bitch
I'm up, I got way too many money
I'm up, you can ask my Mommy
Pourin' up this Dom P (pour up-up-up)
Put a ring 'round your finger, charisma (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I left twenty five thousand on your dresser (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I told her ain't this cool, on like Tesla (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dropped outta school then pulled up in a Tesla (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All my girlfriends are real done (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I told 'em baby "don't waste my time" (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I put your ring on rocks, uh (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woah, I told the bitch I want icy teeth

[Chorus]
Woah, I told her she got a Thug wannabe
Woah, Demon Hellcat and I'm tearin' up the streets
Woah, I got a gun and a Patek on me
Woah, I tote a brand new bag on me
Woah, I beat the bitch up in Givenchy
Woah, I bought the stadium, won't need no seats
Woah, and I got cadence and real nice teeth
Woah, bitch, brown like Cocoa, the real ice tea
Your Louboutin heels, you never gon' wear Nike's
I done left you for years, this shit still the same, I see
For now, I ain't stanin' no Nike's (oh-oh-oh)
My bitch is a Virgo but she actin' like a Pisces

[Verse 2]
Rag talk, oh, yeah, the first time I bought a watch, oh, yeah
Mad flossin', oh, yeah, your nigga got mad sauce, oh, yeah
Spin the block, oh, yeah, the kids are dodgin' shots, oh, yeah
Big dawg, oh, yeah, but they won't let me take a fall, oh, yeah
Gucci socks, oh, yeah, Fendi watch, oh, yeah
Jimmy Choo heel, it's her birthday, sendin' shots, oh, yeah
Shawty sayin' it's her birthday, keep it on the rocks, oh, yeah
Audemar, oh, yeah, match the buss count, oh, yeah

[Refrain]
Yuh, la, la
It's just funny how I do you, ha-ah-ah
