[Intro]
My bro, what's up, nigga?
I got you, turn up
Ay, ay, ay, chee, chee chee!

[Hook]
I'ma cop a brand new house for this dope, boy
All my dogs that turned pretty call them yorks, boy
If I'm ever in the hood, I got them narcs, boy
Hundred grand made on the porch, boy
Boy, young boy hot as a torch, boy
Boy, boy, hitman answer in the dark, boy
Boooy, boy, boy, hey, hey, hey, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy

[Verse]
I can't wait for one of these pussy niggas to play, I'ma cock it and let it rip like bo-bo-boy
It do not matter where I'm shooting, they think I got extended clips don't look like bo-bo-boy
If that's my nigga, I will bleed for him
If he has arms, I put some grams inside the leaf for him
I catch your bitch, control her like a leash on her
My whoadie got lots of keys like Alicia on him
Gra-gra-gra shut down with like gun Travis
Lotta bandz on your set like you live in Aspen
I'ma shine bitch, call me Ol' Dirty Bastard
We gon' react when you play, last nigga laughing

[Hook]
I'ma cop a brand new house for this dope, boy
All my dogs that turned pretty call them yorks, boy
If I'm ever in the hood, I got them narcs, boy
Hundred grand made on the porch, boy
Boy, young boy hot as a torch, boy
Boy, boy, hitman answer in the dark, boy
Boooy, boy, boy, hey, hey, hey, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
