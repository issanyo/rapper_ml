[Intro: Young Thug]
Aye man this real G shit, Pimp shit
Big B shit, c shit too
I got some big ole giant C’s with me
Ain't no way they Stevie Wonder, they big ole giant Cs

[Hook: Gunna & Duke]
I have to say , cuz this understood
I do this shit here for the hood
Went to the top at this shit from the foot
Tell momma that we gonna be good
I do this shit here for the bros
We do not do it for hoes
Straight out the hood and my niggas they rollin
Keep a strap and my niggas stay totin'
These little niggas they rougeish
Pull up in Phantoms no Lotus
Like a broke car I stay smokin
Cali Kush what I be chokin
Stayed down and I turned important
Cop ain't sitting on Forgies
Young nigga I'm aiming up at the Forbes list
Stood on the block I just broke on the tour list
YSL Shit this shit here is notorious

[Verse 1: Gunna]
You only get one life to live it, I risk it all for the riches
You pop it off with the bitches, I wanna run the whole city
I hit the block chasing millions
I gonna stop my nigga
But the crime stoppers tried stop a nigga
We at the house my nigga screamin fuck the cops
The police shot my nigga
I made a lot my nigga
Lost a lot my nigga you wouldn't believe it
You can't trust everybody, caught a body, I done seen it
I look through these glasses and read it
Can't trust these niggas they'll deceive you
They'll bite on and they feeder
Some shit they do you won't believe it
That's why I do it for the fam
Put that shit right on the scale
Bag that shit up make a sale
If you get caught in a cell, tell her you may keep it real
I hope he don't fold like a wallet
Hope he pray up and stay solid
We ain't gonna sit out and ?

[Verse 2: Duke]
Came from the block I was selling them rocks
Money going up just like some shocks
No lames in my picture bitch you gettin cropped
I don't wanna fuck bitch I just want some top
Please don't come 'round here if you ain't talking guap
I'ma keep goin and goin and goin I'm never gon stop
We can’t stop better call the cops
Man down nigga just got shot
Feds just ran up in the spot, niggas be snitchin and you gotta watch it
Bitches be leaching so you gotta thot em
These niggas be hating these niggas be plotting
Aim at your brain I’ll knock it right out
These niggas so lame and they softer than cotton
I just stay focused and I turned important
Straight from the dealership sat it on forges
Little more money little less worries
Thugga he got me here he keep me encouraged
I wanna championship ring just like Curry
Straight out them trenches they know I'm a warrior
Told my momma she ain't got no more worries
I don't gotta say it but I have deserve this
