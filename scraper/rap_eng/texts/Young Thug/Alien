[Hook: Young Thug]
We are not the same, I am an alien
And I pull up in the whip, look like a spaceship
No way you gon’ find these, these Australian
And I’m smoking on that strong like my weed weightlift
I got young niggas, they gon’ pull up and spray shit
They gon’ pull out them bananas and go apeshit
We are not the same, I am Arcadian
Nigga it don’t make no money, it don’t make sense

[Verse 1: Solo Lucci]
I got stacks, I got them Jacksons just like Michael
I got racks on racks, they just all [?] it’s an idol
Lil nigga if it don’t make no money, it don’t make sense
All these cuts on my wrist, you think I’m suicidal
I might, but my bitch imported
Cause I can afford it
My pockets on Norbit
I put that on the bible
Got your bitch on her knees looking up to me like an idol
Bitch I’m the shit, I just might need a diaper
These niggas tryna catch my wave, no tidal
No wardrobe, it’s a high [?], you better hide it
Cause nigga you ain’t kicking this flavor shit like I do
Keep it real, you know I am nothing like you

[Hook: Solo Lucci]
We are not the same, I am an alien
And I pull up in the whip, look like a spaceship
No way you gon’ find these, these Australian
And I’m smoking on that strong like my weed weightlift
I got young niggas that gon’ pull up and spray shit
They gon’ pull out them bananas and go apeshit
We are not the same, I am Arcadian
Nigga it don’t make no money, it don’t make sense

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Diamonds glacier, car so spacious
Dinosaur B's, I’m a blood, shoutout my neighbors
Today my jeans are by ice cream, I might just cake it
We fuck these bitches, we don’t take her, we no gators
But I’m a baker
I cook up the cakes
I’m rich and I know you can see it on my face
My skin look like drapes
I bought my girlfriend a Rolex back in school
I don’t like when she late
My big brother Unfunk bought me a lil tool
Better shoot in that place
Say fuck cancer when you speak
Pink and white Jordans today
We ball like Horry with the Lake’s
These niggas fraudulent and they fake
I do it for my daughter’s sake
We teaching Lucci, be the tutor
My niggas ballin’ like a Buddha
Fuck all these bitches, I want new ones
I fucked her to death, tried to do that shit too sir
