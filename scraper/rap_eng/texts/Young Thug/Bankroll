[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll

[Post-Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Girl, you talkin' that shit, man, I don't wanna hear it
Talkin' that shit, girl, you better say it clearer
I just wanna know if there's gon' be some interference
'Cause I'm lookin' all around if that ass makin' an appearance
Pledge allegiance to the flag, take the money out the bag
Throw the paper in the air, see it stickin' on her leg
Oh damn, better act quick, got an actress bouncin' on a mattress
Got her doin' backflips, hold up
Roll up
If you don't smoke weed, baby, so what?
If you drank too much, baby, throw up
Then pour up
This ya, this ya, this ya first time, you need to grow up
Got dinner reservations out at Boa
Yeah the cameras always flashin' when we show up
Gotta look fly 'cause you know they takin' photos

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll

[Post-Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Walk in with a pocket full of broccoli
Bitch, I'm rich like I hit the fuckin' lottery (what!?)
Started in the trap with an elbow (elbow)
Hit a split on the dick for a bankroll
I was ridin' in a Masi, me and Diplo
Tell your bitch get low like a '64
I don't play no games, Nintendo
Rollie cost a bird, hold it out the window (brrrr)
I'ma make it flip like Skippa (Skippa)
Got a freak every week, I can't kiss her
Red and white Lamb' like a peppermint
Bankroll in each pocket, bitch I'm hella rich (bankroll)
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Your boyfriend cuffin' you like po-po (12)
Pour some more Act, movin' slow-mo
You ain't got the bankroll it's a no go

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll

[Post-Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Pardon me, I'm just ballin' over from the sideline
Pardon your bitch, she ain't watchin' me, I'm going primetime
Rich nigga shit, bet the bitch'll jump on a nigga dick
Bet the bitch'll do it
Rich nigga shit, bet the bitch'll jump on the whole clique
Drop the soap with her
She wet like a boat with her
I'ma wet her up like a cold killer
Thugger Thugger the cold nigga
I done flipped a bird
Then I saw the bitch pat right down on her
And I've been rich for the last five years
No I cannot pipe down

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
