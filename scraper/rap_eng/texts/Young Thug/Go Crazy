[Intro]
Yeah
We got another one
Let me tell you

[Hook]
I can't trust these bitches
I can't trust these niggas
Boot me up, boot me up
I can't trust a falcon
I can't trust a chicken so just
Boot me up, boot me up
I'm a nigga goin crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watching me go crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watch a nigga go crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watch a nigga go crazy
Why watch a nigga go crazy, baby

[Verse 1]
Why watch a nigga go crazy?
Goddamn take these drugs from me
Goddamn take away this ache, I-I meant that Act
Goddamn girl have my back
Even though my money taller than Shaq
Even though we just left Old Nat's
Lil' baby just walked in on me
Lotta snakes they walkin' in on me
Big banks not out the end homie
Got a bad bitch and she want me
Take the molly away, I can't listen
I won't show it, but the drank got me slippin'
Perc's made me beat on her, no whippin'
But the molly make me shine like P. Diddy
I been... geeked out my mind since I was
Like 14 years old
I know she the best, I trained the bitch to go
And wipe a lil' nigga nose
Girl you know I...
Love you a lifetime
I can't tell you "Bye", but
You tell me "Bye" all the time

[Hook]
I can't trust these bitches
I can't trust these niggas
Boot me up, boot me up
I can't trust a falcon
I can't trust a chicken so just
Boot me up, boot me up
I'm a nigga goin crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watching me go crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watch a nigga go crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watch a nigga go crazy
Why watch a nigga go crazy, baby

[Verse 2]
She watch a young nigga go crazy
Out here in these streets
She watch a young nigga get rich
And I started on E
I don't know why she been
Stayin' down with me
I'mma eat it from the start
Until the end
I just bought some brand new spots
And some cars for my momma and them
Yo' bitch get in front of them
Yea, I'mma Bick Back wit Stunna and them
I got hoes all on my timeline
Talkin' bout fuckin' and suckin'
She know if she want this limelight
Suck on 12 like a dozen
My ho pockets full, it look
Like her legs rubbin'
Yea she got the feds covered
Versace, she bed-hunting
This bitch know im bread-running
I done spend 50 thousand on teeth, she ain't said nothin'

[Hook]
I can't trust these bitches
I can't trust these niggas
Boot me up, boot me up
I can't trust a falcon
I can't trust a chicken so just
Boot me up, boot me up
I'm a nigga goin crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watching me go crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watch a nigga go crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watch a nigga go crazy
Why watch a nigga go crazy, baby
