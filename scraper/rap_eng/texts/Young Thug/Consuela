[Verse 1: Belly]
She hit the plane with half a kilo
She turned around and said tranquilo
Tomorrow meet me at mi casa
Just call me when you know que pasa
I think I'm falling for Consuela
She's from the slums of Venezuela
No I can't wait until mañana
I fly and meet you in Havana
I'm dressed in black just like mi gente
Like es el dia de la muerte
She's only loyal to el jefe
I bet she taste just like tres leches

[Hook: Belly]
I think I'm falling for Consuela
I think I'm falling for Consuela
I think I'm falling for Consuela
I think I'm falling for Consuela

[Verse 2: Young Thug & Zack Kharbouch]
I gave a 'Rari to my brother (skrt-skrt-skrt)
I bought a mansion for my mother (for my mother)
I got like 20s in all colors (xannies and percs)
I'ma get these hoes just like [?]
Turned to a boss, start writing checks (writing checks)
Got 20,000 VV's on my neck (on my neck)
Turned to a monster, I'm T-Rex
I'm with your wife, no I don't kiss her, hey
She got me running like El Chapo
I took my other bitch to Cabo
All she call me is el jefe
Feds asking questions, no comprende (no sabe nada)

[Hook: Belly]
I think I'm falling for Consuela
I think I'm falling for Consuela
I think I'm falling for Consuela
I think I'm falling for Consuela

[Verse 3: Belly & Zack Kharbouch]
She love to argue papa fuera
Gave her love but she no quería
She used to sing guantanamera
Diamonds dancing, Macarena
I'm tryna be a caballero
I think she only love dinero
She have some beef and dropped some pesos
That's hamburguesa with the queso

[Hook: Belly]
I think I'm falling for Consuela
I think I'm falling for Consuela
I think I'm falling for Consuela
I think I'm falling for Consuela
