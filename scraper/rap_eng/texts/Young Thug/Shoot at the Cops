[Verse 1]
Got a brand new car, got a giant cigar
Got a hoe, she a star
Got some niggas doin' bars, got some niggas behind bars
Take care behind bars, spend a whole hundred large (real racks)
Tryna give my bro a pill, I’m tryna get a bigger deal
I'm tryna get a bigger meal, I'm tryna get big as a whale (oh yeah)
I’m bout to stay away from jail (Jeffery)
I'm bout to stay away from poor ass niggas on the come up
Moving like snails (Jeffery)
Hell yeah nigga yeah (oh Jeffery)
I'm bout to get up out the streets
I'm bout to get up out the heat
I'm bout to get inside the AC
I got a pool and it deep
I'm tryna get away from hoes, I'm tryna stay away from clothes
I'm tryna stay away from lean, molly, drugs
And stack up me some dough (stack up, stacks)
I’m so tired, I’m bout to stay away from tribes
I'm bout to stay away from guys
I’m bout to stay away from lies
I'm standing away from cloud 9, I don't wanna be high
You can have that bitch, nigga
I don't want it to be mines (hell naw)
Your boxers Calvin Klein, last week you was just fine
Yesterday I had on some gators, looking like I’m still in '99
Looking like my Uncle in his prime
I was taught to never drop a dime
I was taught to never do the crime if you ain't tryna do that time

[Hook]
Heard that nigga be drippin' every day
Heard that nigga need kidneys every day
I know homie pimpin' every day
I know homie, I know I know, hey
I just wanna drop my top, I just wanna wet a nigga block
I'm just banging red, bitch I'm banging red sox
No I can't stop, hoe call the cops
We shootin' at the opps, fuck around and shoot at the cops

[Verse 2]
Gum drop my ears, let her drive if she real (skrt skrt)
Let her package a sealy, got on the Richard Millie (what?!)
I'm changing your living
I bought me some marbles, I'm bout to deck out your kitchen
I'm bought to do something the realest (fuck is you doin')
I'm bought to do something the illest (woo)
The illest I could do, I had to cook up a chicken (woo, woo)
And front it all to you (aye)
She looking, she dig it, like a tool, woah (I see you, aye)
Key to the city, nigga what it do, woah
I just might egg the basket, I drink the red if it's plastic
Cause I gotta load of the Ac'
I'ma drink that and pour out the yak (lean lean lean)
Speaking of yak, bitch free the [?]
Bitch free the Goat (Roscoe)
RIP Troup from [?] (woo!)
I cop me a foreign, believe that it's running
Do everything under the sun, you gotta disguise to your sons
I'ma go grip on her buns
She said she wanna go to Dubai and have her some fun
Treat like she the one

[Hook]
Heard that nigga be drippin' every day
Heard that nigga need kidneys every day
I know homie pimpin' every day
I know homie, I know I know, hey
I just wanna drop my top, I just wanna wet a nigga block
I'm just banging red, bitch I'm banging red sox
No I can't stop, hoe call the cops
We shootin' at the opps, fuck around and shoot at the cops
