I think I'm OD'ing on drugs
Nigga I started a fight inside the club
Never switched up on my brew im not a dub

Baby said she gon' help me out with my problems
I'm still screaming fuck the crime stoppers
Yes I’ll hit you up, go do a dub for my partner
Yaahh, riding in the back just like a scrub for my partner
Knuck if you buck for my partner
Yeah I show love for my partner
I'mma fuck a ho when I leave the club just for my partner
I'mma pull off and take off on my plug that's for my partner
I can live life on a boat like Nautica with my partner
That's my motherfuckin' partner in crime, baby
And you know I'm never stoppin' the time lil baby
And you know it's not a doubt in my mind lil baby
And you know I'm doin' it for the slimes baby
