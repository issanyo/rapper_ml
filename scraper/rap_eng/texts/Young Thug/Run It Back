[Intro: Young Thug]
Run it back, run it back

[Chorus: Tyga & Young Thug]
Oh baby, I just wanna replay and run it back
I just wanna replay and run it back
Oh baby, every time we play (Every time we play)
Wanna run it like a running back (Run it like a running back)
I just wanna replay (I just wanna replay) and run it back
Oh, baby
[I did breadcrumbs, pretty fucked up]
Oh, baby
[??]
Oh, baby
[??] pom pom
Oh, baby
She just want me to eat that pom pom
Oh, baby
Let's have a replay (Replay)
I'm on it (On it)
Whenever she say (I'm on it)
Whatever she want, she got it
And she gon' shoot 'em down
Oh, baby

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Running me to run it up
Lilâ€™ some some for the one I want
My number one, my 1 of 1
God and goddess, that's a holy fuck
We at the rich suites, like it's Peachtree
We gon' run it up like floor seats
Nigga got game, I'm like Gucci Mane
She a keeper mane, she go both ways
Make her fall in love, fuck, smoke a blunt
Now when we drunk, wake that pussy up
Too high to sleep, wetting all the sheets
That's a kitty call, just unplug the phone
Gucci bag call, Gucci bag cash
Reaching for my phone, let me record that ass
Let me record that ass
If the shit leak, don't be mad

[Chorus: Tyga & Young Thug]
Oh baby, I just wanna replay and run it back
I just wanna replay and run it back
Oh baby, every time we play
Wanna run it like a running back
I just wanna replay and run it back
Oh, baby
[I did breadcrumbs, pretty fucked up]
Oh, baby
[??]
Oh, baby
[??] pom pom
Oh, baby
She just want me to eat that pom pom
Oh, baby
Let's have a replay (Replay)
I'm on it (On it)
Whenever she say (I'm on it)
Whatever she want, she got it
And she gon' shoot 'em down
Oh, baby

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Beat it in the Cadillac, that pussy got me sidetracked
Like Kylie I'm with Tyga, we the perfect match
Put it in the belly, she feel the impact
Put it in her chest and make that hoe hit high notes
Shawty pussy wet, are you gonna take off your clothes?
Take a ride with me, I'll help you see what you lost
Anything happen here, anything goes
Money on the counter, Versace couch on the floor
I got big booty bitches shakin' ass by my door
Heated marble got lil mama ridin' tip-toe
My brother a Tyga, I'm a goat
Let's have a replay (Replay)
I'm on it (On it)
Whenever she say (I'm on it)
Whatever she want, she got it
And she gon' shoot 'em down

[Chorus: Tyga & Young Thug]
Oh baby, I just wanna replay and run it back
I just wanna replay and run it back
Oh baby, every time we play
Wanna run it like a running back
I just wanna replay and run it back
Oh, baby
[I did breadcrumbs, pretty fucked up]
Oh, baby
[??]
Oh, baby
[??] pom pom
Oh, baby
She just want me to eat that pom pom
Oh, baby

[Outro: Young Thug]
Let's have a replay (Replay)
I'm on it (On it)
Whenever she say (I'm on it)
Whatever she want, she got it
And she gon' shoot 'em down
Oh, baby
