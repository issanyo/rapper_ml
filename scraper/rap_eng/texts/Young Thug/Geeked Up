[Hook]
Got a whole thing of molly
Don't tell no body
Geeked up can't stop it, fall asleep in the lobby
Got a whole thing of lean, I don't pop no bean
Pull up on the scene, paint it red and green
Got a whole bunch of money, got a whole bunch of cash
Got a whole bunch of hash, Two hundred on the dash
I don't wanna drive fast
I don't wanna serve bags
Ridin' round with stevie, ain't talkin' bout Nash

[Verse 1]
I'm creepin' in a motherfuckin' crouch
[?]
Bust it down, hit your avenue and off the shit
Fake bricks don't even know where Slauson is, slash that
Where the guns at? I'm hands on with those
I don't serve none, its the wrong number
Hit my mans phone for those
I got brown sugar, you say you want pink toes
Got big dimes same size as mentos
We still eating that slice, no kimbo
This S double M shit I'm a member
I meant member, whats the word, I drank the syrup
And I smoke kush thats OG, not Purp

[Verse 2]
That's a nice [?] where the move hoe
I'm not slim but I'm Dunkin in your hoe, (RIP Doe)
On the molly everything is very slow (what the fuck)
But my heart beating fast as hell yo (oh my gosh)
What the hell done got to me (Ion know)
I'm geekin' off profit shit (trippin')
I tell her young future watch this
I bring it all back inside the pot with it (woah) cooked
Amazing fucking grace (oh my god)
All this ice inside my rings you could skate
I'm better than crocker with the cake
I ain't cookin' on house but the dope taste like steak
