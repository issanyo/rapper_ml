[Intro]
Hi world, I see all of you
I'm on a private fuckin' jet you idiots

[Hook]
They want to fuck the Thugger
Alphabetical order
I'm chasing cash, I thought I told you
Make that ass clap like Magnolia
Please don’t waste no time
I won’t see you shine
Please don’t waste no motherfucking time
I just want to see it, I just want to beat it
Don’t play

[Verse 1]
Ohh, lil mama got camel toe
You already know
I spent a dub on her throat
Yeah I’m tricking off these days
Cartiers 25 hundred bucks
That’s nothing to a fucking boss bruh
Right wrist Audemar, Brietling on the left
I’m a stoner child, aka Jeff
Scrabble board, too many choices
Molly or the Mary, fish scale [?]
I’m so in the air, I’m taller than your hair

[Hook]
They want to fuck the Thugger
Alphabetical order
I'm chasing cash, I thought I told you
Make that ass clap like Magnolia
Please don’t waste no time
I won’t see you shine
Please don’t waste no motherfucking time
I just want to see it, I just want to beat it
Don’t play

[Verse 2]
Chrome Heart specs, they salute my face
Guwop a real nigga, he just beat my case
He know I got street ties, I came from that clay
I’m surrounded by M&Ms, doctor Thugger Dre
Get wicked bout them M&Ms, just like Lil Wicced
MPA, my bitty, we count real digits
Hundred thousand pounds of midget
Seven, seven, or eight, cooked up chickens
Powder, powder, powder
Put a grammy on the table and make that bitch snort it
And you know my dope as white as a towel
If you know you sweet, go take [?]

Please don’t waste no time
I won’t see you shine
Please don’t waste no motherfucking time
I just want to see it, I just want to beat it
Don’t play
