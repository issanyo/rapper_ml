[Chorus: Lil Freaky]
Already did what I had to do
Pour up a four up and hop in the coupe
I drip from my top to my motherfuckin' shoe
Chasin' this paper, I'm out for this loot
I keep me three bitches like I'm Uncle Luke
I'm clutching this forty, just pray I won't shoot
I'm praying and praying the forty don't jam
Niggas be copyin', you know they gon' scam
Oh, oh, ayy
These niggas be copyin', you know they gon' scam
Hit that boy's block and you know that boy ran
Hop out and slide, them camera door vans
Twist up, be geekin', we back on them xans
We back on them xans, ooh, ooh ooh

[Verse 1: Lil Freaky]
Pop us some xans and pop at your mans
Got thirty in my clip, this bitch ain't got jam
Your bitch on my dick, you know she ain't none
Chasing this paper, hundred miles of running
Thirties and Glocks, you know how we comin'
Hit your lil block like Osama, we bomin'
'Bout to hop in the coupe, got your bitch in the front
These niggas keep asking me way that I'm stuntin'
Pull on a nigga for what, I really came from nothin'
They put the blame on us, iced the gang out, put chains on us
She put my name on her, I put the gang on me
I copped the coupe for no reason
I cut off the top and I bloodied the seats
I put the blood in the beef, I put the B in the beef
I put the stick in the seat, and he ain't gon' stop whenever it's beef

[Chorus: Lil Freaky]
Already did what I had to do
Pour up a four up and hop in the coupe
I drip from my top to my motherfuckin' shoe
Chasin' this paper, I'm out for this loot
I keep me three bitches like I'm Uncle Luke
I'm clutching this forty, just pray I won't shoot
I'm praying and praying the forty don't jam
Niggas be copyin', you know they gon' scam
Oh, oh, ayy
These niggas be copyin', you know they gon' scam
Hit that boy's block and you know that boy ran
Hop out and slide, them camera door vans
Twist up, be geekin', we back on them xans
We back on them xans

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
We back on them xans, yeah, back on them xans
I'm flushing this coupe, I don't know what to do
Bentley Bentayga with no shoes
I'm enable you and your crew if you play with this loot
Got your mom playing sad tunes and your folks in suits
Don't run up on me, you know I got glue
You know I'm a thug and you know I'm gon' shoot
Couple big bodies, a couple of coupes
I'm in Dubai, I'm on a cruise
I'ma have ten, I gotta swoop
And I got a bag of beans
All I got is lean
All I got is cream
Shampoo I'm clean
Old school bitch, everything new

[Chorus: Lil Freaky]
Already did what I had to do
Pour up a four up and hop in the coupe
I drip from my top to my motherfuckin' shoe
Chasin' this paper, I'm out for this loot
I keep me three bitches like I'm Uncle Luke
I'm clutching this forty, just pray I won't shoot
I'm praying and praying the forty don't jam
Niggas be copyin', you know they gon' scam
Oh, oh, ayy
These niggas be copyin', you know they gon' scam
Hit that boy's block and you know that boy ran
Hop out and slide, them camera door vans
Twist up, be geekin', we back on them xans
We back on them xans

[Outro: Young Thug]
It's a scandal
