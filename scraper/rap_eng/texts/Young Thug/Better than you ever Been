[Intro: Taylor Bennett]
Than you ever been, yeah
Lookin' better than ya ever been
Okay, yeah, uh
Yeah

[Chorus: Taylor Bennett]
Baby girl you lookin' better than ya ever been
Wrote you something special
Just so you can run and tell your friends
Perfect in your melanin, and elegance your element
Baby girl you lookin' better than ya ever been, uh
Lookin' better than ya ever been
Wrote you something special
Just so you can run and tell your friends
Perfect in your melanin, and elegance your element
Baby girl you lookin' better than ya ever been

[Verse 1: Taylor Bennett]
Baby girl you looking bad as fuck
But your friends want me, you must have a job or something
When I'm just trying to shoot my shot like Iverson
You probably fuck with NBA niggas, and I'll be one
You know, young niggas ball all the time like Melo
Keep a couple OG shooters called Melo
And if you only fuck with white dudes (Aw hell naw!)
Well fuck it, I could be Othello
Only black nigga with side-court passes wavin' hello
Got big gats and big black pearls like Jack Sparrow
Could take you to Ruth's Chris but I'd rather take you to Harold's
And Chicago shit is real, it's the industry that's the error
Miss the TV, eat my enemy, energy, and my level
If I didn't shoot my shot, couldn't handle my rifle better
I thought you was Coretta, but you was more like Cruella
So fuck it, it's okay mommy
I'ma let you go to bed, uh

[Chorus: Taylor Bennett]
Baby girl you lookin' better than ya ever been
Wrote you something special
Just so you can run and tell your friends
Perfect in your melanin, and elegance your element
Baby girl you lookin' better than ya ever been, uh
Lookin' better than you've ever been
Wrote you something special
Just so you can run and tell your friends
Perfect in your melanin, and elegance your element
Baby girl you lookin' better than ya ever been

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
You lookin' better than ever
Good sunny tan like you dodgin' bad weather
Yeah, big meat, Roc-A-Fella
24 shares, like you collectin' feathers
Yeah, since we speaking 'bout feathers
I got Mink on my doors and Gucci for the fellas
Yeah, I ain't ever work for Diddy
Know I dance, but I got a Rolls Royce Umbrella
Keep me cold under my fashion
They got a tall red hoe from passion
She a horse, voice raspin'
Tiger stripes on her booty, call her Lion King
White toes and they tiny
Ask her do she like hoes, she's say "slightly"
I'm running from her soul in these Nikes
Bad bitch, she deserve to be in the pen, 'cause

[Chorus: Taylor Bennett & Both]
Baby girl you lookin' better than ya ever been
Wrote you something special
Just so you can run and tell your friends
Perfect in your melanin, and elegance your element
Baby girl you lookin' better than ya ever been, uh
Lookin' better than ya ever been
Wrote you something special
Just so you can run and tell your friends
Perfect in your melanin, and elegance your element
Baby girl you lookin' better than ya ever been

[Outro: Taylor Bennett]
Than ya ever been
Yeah, lookin' better than ya ever been
Okay
Yeah, uh
