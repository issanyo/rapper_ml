[Intro]

808 Mafia
Jeffery

[Verse 1]
These watches, they Rollies, nigga
These hoes, they fuck a nigga
I fuck 'round and buss a nigga
They'll fuck 'round, be bussin' niggas
Down to the hospital
Now you a vegetable, nigga
You gotta learn everything over
Uh, give 'em a tricycle

[Chorus]
I get that dope from a Mexican
I put that dick in her butt again
Fuck 'round, get left in the cut again
Fuck 'round, get left with a mug again
I'm 'bout to pull up like what again
I'm 'bout to stop when she nut again
I got ten clocks in my clutch again
Call up my boys and they rush again
They gon' do what imma say
I just got a bad bitch naked, yeah
I'ma keep my flag to the right, yeah
Been hittin' like a deer in headlights, yeah
I just got some bags and some bricks
I just got some bad lookin' bitches
Playing with the dog like a kitty
I'ma put some scabs on them bitches

[Verse 2]
We get 'em back when we roll 'em in
I know too much to be broke again
I know some bitches that's trill as them
When you do right it keep comin' in
Peel a loaf of bread on 'em
Wheat, wheat Timbs with some green on it
Buy the bitch a bag with CÃ©line on it
Buy the bitch a glass with some lean on it (slatt slatt slatt slatt!!)
I just made a way for the bros
Hop up out the Wraith on these hoes, yeah
All my diamonds stained and they froze
I look at y'all niggas like jokes
I just poured a deuce in a Jones
I just made the mothafucka strong
I'ma pop purp when I bone
Them bitches make you fuck 'em mad long

[Chorus]
I get that dope from a Mexican
I put that dick in her butt again
Fuck 'round, get left in the cut again
Fuck 'round, get left with a mug again
I'm 'bout to pull up like what again
I'm 'bout to stop when she nut again
I got ten clocks in my clutch again
Call up my boys and they rush again
They gon' do what imma say
I just got a bad bitch naked, yeah
I'ma keep my flag to the right, yeah
Been hittin' like a deer in headlights, yeah
I just got some bags and some bricks
I just got some bad lookin' bitches
Playing with the dog like a kitty
I'ma put some scabs on them bitches

[Verse 3]
Nigga, I'ma deep when I'm sleep
Flooded OG through the streets
Teach you how to do it like dis
Nigga's diamonds hotter than a beach, yeah
DC, gotta fuck with Meek
DC, gotta fuck with Gleesh
Deep sea, diamonds need fish
Species, what the fuck is this?
Yeah, I got big bands on the road
I got bad bitches takin' notes
Runnin' up the credit and the loans
Cut the bitch a check and get gone (hey)
I can be a hands-full
I got the bands like I just hit the lotto
I got a big bag, yeah that's where the cash go
A nigga's diamonds yellow like a ref flag though
(Slatt slatt slatt slatt!!)

[Chorus]
I get that dope from a Mexican
I put that dick in her butt again
Fuck 'round, get left in the cut again
Fuck 'round, get left with a mug again
I'm 'bout to pull up like what again
I'm 'bout to stop when she nut again
I got ten clocks in my clutch again
Call up my boys and they rush again
They gon' do what imma say
I just got a bad bitch naked, yeah
I'ma keep my flag to the right, yeah
Been hittin' like a deer in headlights, yeah
I just got some bags and some bricks
I just got some bad lookin' bitches
Playing with the dog like a kitty
I'ma put some scabs on them bitches
