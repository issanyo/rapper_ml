[Intro: Young Thug & Kodak Black]
Yeah, -tata
-trip
I ain't really finna tell y'all how to get away with murder and shit
Forever, forever, forever forever, forever, forever, for-ever
Forever, forever, forever, forever forever, forever, for-ever...

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Forever, forever-ever baby
Would you love me forever-ever, baby?
Would you fuck me forever-ever, baby?
Would you kiss me forever-ever, baby?
Top floor, I was in the nosebleed
Like I just dropped diamonds, I'm flushing
None of these niggas can smoke me easy
Tour bus smoking on that musty

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Know I been in love for a while
You gon' make me fall in love for a while
Hopping out the SLS for a while
Baby girl got me so obsessed for a while, babe
You gon' really have to hold me fucking down, babe
'Cause I ain't with the fuckery that playing 'round, babe
Unless we playing in the sheets, baby mad laid
Forever-ever in them cheeks, baby mad cake
Forever-ever getting cheese, baby mad cake
Yeah, getting mad cake
Yeah, getting cheese, getting mad cake
Dick down baby bustin' on your whole face
AP, had to go and ice the whole face
Yeah, nigga fresher than some Colgate
Hanging with some big gorillas, and they go ape
Talk down, pussy nigga be a cold case
Yeah 'cause I'm forever a thug, ever a thug
Baby I'm forever in love, ever in love
Make me feel better with love
When I said I love you, bitch, I said it with love

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Yeah I'm forever a thug, ever a thug
Baby I'm forever in love, forever in love
Make me feel better with love
When I said I love you, bitch I said it with love, yeah
I'm watching the highs get hypnotized
We Bonnie and Clyde but except the shots
Speaking of shots, I got Silkk The Shocker mindset bitch
Dinosaur Actavis bottles, yeah T-Rex shit
This money'll change your friends but your girl love it
But believing a bitch is a sin so I don't go for that
Pimp dress talk, bitch, I can make this work walk
I'm a gangsta, you a cop nigga bad luck

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Forever, forever-ever baby
Would you love me forever-ever, baby?
Would you fuck me forever-ever, baby?
Would you kiss me forever-ever, baby?
Top floor, I was in the nosebleed
Like I just dropped diamonds, I'm flushing
None of these niggas can smoke me easy
Tour bus smoking on that musty

[Verse 3: Reese LaFlare]
I need the racks, the cheddar, forever-ever
I need them bands, them bands, forever-ever
Why you playin' with this ice now, forever-ever
Oh no no no, I'ma never let her
He don't love you like he should, I can love you better
Oh, he donâ€™t fuck you like he should, I can fuck you better
Pull the Porsche out the lot, put the brakes on the pedal
Just know that this drip lasts forever
Just know that this drip lasts forever
Just know that this drip lasts forever
Just know that this drip lasts forever
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
Forever, forever forever forever forever

[Outro: Young Thug]
Forever, forever, forever forever, forever, forever, for-ever
Forever, forever, forever, forever forever, forever, for-ever...
