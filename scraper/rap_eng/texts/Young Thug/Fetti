[Chorus: Fetty Wap & Young Thug]
What would you do for the money baby? (yeah)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I'm 'bout to stop fuckin' with niggas I know ain't with it

You lil fuck niggas is mama boys, go suck a titty (bitch!)
Fuck it, I cop a new ride and I pick up some fours in the city (skrrt!)
Mollies on percs and you know I'm geeked, 'nother fifty
No barbaric bitch, I got on some Burberry
I keep them blue Benjamins on me, fuck credit
If you go on this move you might get you a slice like a deli
Big choppers, I got lots of bullets, Andrettis
I'm a big dog, I'm a big dog
Be with my boy, pina colada
I am a tiger, fuck a Mufasa

[Verse 3: Juugman]
Look at the Lou', come straight out the box
I play with fetti but my name ainâ€™t Wap
Hop out that truck and I hop in the drop
Hit from the back but I love her on top
What would you do for the cash?
What would you do for the cash?
I'm talkin' that money with Thugger right now while we thumb through a bag
Still on the block, yeah I jugg through that work
Still movin' slow on that purp
Niggas OG's, oh don't play with the ave, killer put hole in your shirt
Hit a nigga where it hurt, I'ma get her out her skirt
Shoot an uzi 'bout my nigga Uzi in the winter time ridin' vert
Diamonds flashin' like an ambulance
In the bank doin' the money dance
Overseas with a foreign bitch, too red for me, gotta get a tan
What would you do for this paper baby?
Still screamin' fuck a hater baby
I'm the Cavs, you the Lakers baby
Gated cribs sit on acres baby, Juug

[Chorus: Fetty Wap & Young Thug]
What would you do for the money baby? (yeah)
Zoovie-Zoo and Thugger baby (yeah baby)
Slime told me to bring the thunder (yeah baby)
I swear to God this is what they wanted, yeah baby
I want some fetti, let's count some fetti
I am so ready, like spaghetti
I want that fetti, I need that fetti
She want that fetti, believing in fetti, bet it
