[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
Yeah, Hey look
Stop looking out that door shawty
Man you see my neighbors all in my business?
What the fuck you take me for?

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Hey, I spots in they boomin's
All my neighbors, yeah, they nosy
I got Glocks, I got holsters
All my partners know Iâ€™m loaded
Some of them spot, they got roaches
Cause they still in the trenches
50 spot when we had roaches
Ho, I don't get offended
All this money I been chasing
All this money I been making
I won't stop, I can't stop
'Til I'm the motherfuckin' greatest
I won't stop, I can't stop
'Til my fuckin' dyin' days
Yeah I made it, yeah I made it, yeah I made it
I made it, I made it

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I made it, you didn't
I told Quan this was written
I made it, went brazy pharmaceutic I need really
They hate I made it so I sit back featuring these bullets
You can't get it out your head like a fuck hoody
I got bad foreign bitches, they say I like them bullets
I might leave his ass hot like a fuckin' skillet
Then put money on his head like a fuckin' Skully
Fire, my boys love the cars
Hey, my girls love me
Play with me like it's a game of rugby
AK's with me like I'm a fuckin' Russian

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I know the niggas mad I made it
I know the nigga mad I say it
2 million dollars in one year
Ain't playin', ain't playin', ain't playin'
I can fit $500,000 in these pants
Trap spot done made a nigga a couple extra hundred thousand off xans
I'm prayin', I'm prayin', I'm prayin', I'm prayin'
The feds don't kick my door, I know they lookin' for me
I don't want your ho, just want that cookie from her
She tried to resist so I took it from her
How you gonna tell me no, you must not know who I am
Even if I'm on the road I see whats goin' on cause you know I got cameras
I don't know no questions but I know the answers
I throw these black fists just like a panther
Too much work cause I got

[Hook]
