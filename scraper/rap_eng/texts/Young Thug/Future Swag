[Intro]
Thugga
Yeah it's that cash talk
Slatt Slatt Slatt

[Chorus]
I fuck on your baby mama
I fuck on your baby mama
Let's fuck on your baby mama
Cause I wanna fuck on your baby mama
Some head from your baby mama
I need some brain from your baby mama
The head from your baby mama
I need me some brain from your baby mama
Lil mama she wet like a boat, a boat
Lil mama, she wet like a boat
Lil mama she wet like a boat, a boat
Lil mama, she wet like a boat
Lil mama, she ready for war
She ready for dick in her ass and her throat
Lil mama she wet for the faculty
Lil mama, she ready, she after me

[Bridge]
Gon' do it, gon' do it
Gon' do it, they way too influenced
I do it, I do it, I'm the goat I'm the motherfuckin' mule
I do it, I don't know the president but I got pull
I do it, the only thing I see is red like a bull

[Verse 1]
That purple label all up under my garments
They tourin', I fuck on that bitch in the back of the tour
I feed her that molly she put it right there on her tongue
You call me Osama I'm passin' hundreds to the bombs
I'm passin' hundreds to the bum nigga
You know thats nothin' but some crumbs nigga
The finger lickin' and my palms itchin'
I'm dead fresh, fuck a prom nigga
I'm on yo' ass like some thongs, nigga
I'm brand new just born, nigga
I'm gettin' hundreds like a foreign nigga
You know we chargin' like Dodge nigga

[Chorus]
I fuck on your baby mama
I fuck on your baby mama
Let's fuck on your baby mama
Cause I wanna fuck on your baby mama
Some head from your baby mama
I need some brain from your baby mama
The head from your baby momma
I need me some brain from your baby mama
Lil mama she wet like a boat, a boat
Lil mama, she wet like a boat
Lil mama she wet like a boat, a boat
Lil mama, she wet like a boat
Lil mama, she ready for war
She ready for dick in her ass and her throat
Lil mama she work for the faculty
Lil mama, she ready, she after me

[Verse 2]
I won't hear you scream if you rich
I'm never gon' go out like Meech
I know that I look like a lick
I chop off your tongue, ya dig
A solid foundation the nation
Believe this shit started in the basement
My uncle that died is amazing
You see all the looks on my faces
I see all them racks on ya' cases
We send them to a better place
We send them boys to meet their maker
I'm goin' up skyscraper
I think my dogs with my neighbors
Your kids seen me on cable, and
I'm drinkin' syrup, nigga maple (lean)
Hurry up where the gates at
She ain't nothin' I can't cake that
This is only where the apes at
All you lame niggas stay back (move)
Switchin' lanes in the Maybach (skrt)
Hit the motor like a play back
Brand new Rollie and the face black

[Chorus]
I fuck on your baby mama
I fuck on your baby mama
Let's fuck on your baby mama
Cause I wanna fuck on your baby mama
Some head from your baby mama
I need some brain from your baby mama
The head from your baby mama
I need me some brain from your baby mama
Lil mama she wet like a boat, a boat
Lil mama, she wet like a boat
Lil mama she wet like a boat, a boat
Lil mama, she wet like a boat
Lil mama, she ready for war
She ready for dick in her ass and her throat
Lil mama she work for the faculty
Lil mama, she ready, she after me
