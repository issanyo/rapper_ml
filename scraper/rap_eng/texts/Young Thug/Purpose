[Verse 1:]
This a letter to my slimes, what's brackin' slimes?
I had your back every single last fuckin' time
And you know I'm the only one who's gon' die by ya
And you know in Pluto I can stand side to side with ya
I'm livin' every week like it's my birthday week
I can be a birthday freak
Bitch I'm working while you lurking me
I'm in the street like it's my worst week
My bitch boolin', but she say she want that Birkin B
My ex was my purpose, then

[Hook:]
Mama said I had no choice but to do my motherfuckin' thing
Got my shoes, I tied 'em up and made a whole 'nother lane
My diamonds shining, they glistening but they from Johnny fuckin' Dang
You said her cat was terrific and I said the same damn thing

[Verse 2:]
Same damn time
These bitches and these niggas wanna see a nigga dead
Damn why's that? Spam that shit, nigga
Nigga I'm dumping on ya bitch
No Donald, I'll Trump that bitch
Ho say it again, say it again
Kush smell like a skunk
Bitch I'm fresher than a punk

[Bridge 1:]
Okay, now tell me how you want it (What!)
You know that I got it
Big booty ho from Houston
I bang red like a Rocket
Okay well she done been around you
I know all about her
I wanna put a eight-ball in her corner pocket

[Verse 3:]
I just read her diary, went and bought her that Mercedes
No cop cars, she a Taurus
Yeah that "T" that mean she taken
She don't feel right until she play me
She won't take my bread, no baby
And just for that I would love to keep her
She keep going 'round just like an equator
I'll introduce her to paper
Bitch it's a bando, it’s vacant
I bought ice just for my acre
Damn, there go a super star, no shaker
Hey, I grab that pistol and erase him

[Hook:]
Mama said I had no choice but to do my motherfuckin' thing
Got my shoes, I tied 'em up and made a whole 'nother lane
My diamonds shining, they glistening but they from Johnny fuckin' Dang
You said her cat was terrific and I said the same damn thing

[Bridge 2:]
Feel the same way bout it, you feel the same way
I swear I’ll catch me a body, these niggas try to play
You know I'm rich but ain't make you the girl in the same day
You know I don't care about cheese on my head like Green Bay
No way, José
You like my motherfuckin' fate today
I might catch her ‘round the way, stray and save the day
Put that dick inside her she stuck, she stuck like clay
(Ya, ya)
