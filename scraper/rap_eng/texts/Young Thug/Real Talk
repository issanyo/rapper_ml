[Intro: BSlime]
Yeah
See I've been livin’ like the mothafuckin' Baby, you know, huh
Real niggas'll recognize this one
Whew

[Chorus: BSlime]
First you get the money, then the power come (Power come)
Then respect (Then respect)
When you in the street and you a real nigga (Real nigga)
Yeah, you get more respect (More respect)
I’ve been in the streets since I was a youngin' (I was young, yeah)
Posted at the store when I ain't had nothin' (That's on God)
Mama always told me I was gon' be somethin' (Swear)
I ain't never tried to listen to a youngin’ (I ain’t listen)
Since a youngin', yeah, I’ve been poppin' my own gun
I remember times my daddy, he wasn't there for me
They say I'm up, now the nigga tryna care for me
Grandmama always told me that my uncle gonna be somethin’
Now I look at him now, he a mothafuckin' star
Young crew on the block, we was playin' burglar bars
Hate the fact that Phil flipped in that mothafuckin' car
Partna runnin' to the door sayin' bitch, I run you off (Where you at?)

[Verse 1: BSlime]
Yeah, I was on the block totin' big fire at a young age (At a young age)
Yeah, yeah, I ain't never listened to an old head, yeah, I give a fuck what they say
Remember them days at the bottom
Yeah, we were breakin' into houses
We were walkin' on our feet like we was in a track meet
Late nights, we ain't had nowhere to go, yeah (On God)
We were walking to my partner's house
Everybody gangin' up on the floor
Back then we wanna be some ballboys
Then we hit the block and we turned into some tall boys
Talk a nigga down, we was on the slime shit
We were wearin' the same clothes, we ain't never had shit
Then it came to the point where a nigga got shit
Put my bros in a position now everybody lit
Let the beat rock
We was just breakin' into cars (In cars)
Partna took me on my first move, taught me how to rob (How to rob)
He had been to the street, yeah, he was a big boy
Yeah, we was some beginners, yeah, we had to learn hard (Learn hard)

[Chorus: BSlime]
First you get the money, then the power come (Power come)
Then respect (Then respect)
When you in the street and you a real nigga (Real nigga)
Yeah, you get more respect (More respect)
I've been in the streets since I was a youngin' (I was young, yeah)
Posted at the store when I ain't had nothin' (That's on God)
Mama always told me I was gon' be somethin' (Swear)
I ain't never tried to listen to a youngin' (I ain't listen)
Since a youngin', yeah, I've been poppin' my own gun
I remember times my daddy, he wasn't there for me
They say I'm up, now the nigga tryna care for me
Grandmama always told me that my uncle gonna be somethin'
Now I look at him now, he a mothafuckin' star
Young crew on the block, we was playin' burglar bars
Hate the fact that Phil flipped in that mothafuckin' car
Partna runnin' to the door sayin' bitch, I run you off (Where you at?)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Yeah, I left a brick on that dashboard (Woo)
I got game from my pop and didn't ask for it (Oh)
I've been chasin' this cash, I need tankers
Got the wood on the front with the long sword
Lotta boogers, they tryna get me on for it
Lotta hookers, they pass me they thongs, boy
I treated them, it's a long tour
Hundred red bandanas at a resort
I'm 'bout to see 'bout it
I was Bali, no Reebokin'
I was balanced and detoxin' (Whoa)
40 Xanax got me higher (Xans)
Take a flight, I'm like good-bye ya
1.8 for the Bugatti (Yeah, yeah)
I hit from the side like a hook
Kool-Aid pack got these lil' niggas shook (Ayy)
School everyday got my pockets on books (Got my pockets on my books)
Yeah-yeah-yeah (I got my pockets on books)
I know lil' baby can't find me
I've been smokin' this kush like a pine tree
And I've been prepared since the '90s
I call her short, she wan' bite me
Shit, I caught my first lick
I shot him and stained up his white tee

[Chorus: BSlime]
First you get the money, then the power come (Power come)
Then respect (Then respect)
When you in the street and you a real nigga (Real nigga)
Yeah, you get more respect (More respect)
I've been in the streets since I was a youngin' (I was young, yeah)

Now I look at him now, he a mothafuckin' star
Young crew on the block, we was playin' burglar bars
Hate the fact that Phil flipped in that mothafuckin' car
