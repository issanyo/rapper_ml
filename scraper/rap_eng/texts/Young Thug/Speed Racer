[Intro]
I pulled up on the block, I'm speed racin'

Shitted on them nigga like I was constipated
I'm ballin' I don't care if you care or not

[Hook]
I pulled up on the block, I'm speed racin'
I give a damn if you care, I'm an astronaut
I shitted on 'em like I'm constipated
I'm ballin' I don't care if you care or not
I'm ballin' out there
Don't want no problems cause I'm ballin' all in there
Don't need no problems cause I'm ballin' out there
Don't need no problems out there if you care or not

[Verse 1]
YSL status (Slime)
All my bitches baddies (One of a kind)
Creeping in that black truck, uh
Now a nigga stuck like Chuck
Ugh, ugh, ugh, kuh, blat, Suwu red chuck
Converse, Slash that Bonverse
Pass that... that loud that concert
I pass that... to my guys not hoes first
Whoa, whoa whoa, Losie voice, whoa

I was at a concert and my gun showed (Where you was?)
And I was in Cali, ain't no codes

[Hook]
I pulled up on the block, I'm speed racin'
I give a damn if you care, I'm an astronaut
I shitted on 'em like I'm constipated
I'm ballin' I don't care if you care or not
I'm ballin' out there
Don't want no problems cause I'm ballin' all in there
Don't need no problems cause I'm ballin' out there
Don't need no problems out there if you care or not


[Verse 2]
She a diva, I leave her, mistreat her (And what?)
I defeat her
Ballin' out the street, uh
I betrayed her
Spaghetti, out the strainer
Cocaina
Ryu, Ryu the fuck nigga gotta fight by you
A boy can’t fight, walk by you
Stay in the kid place, nigga, Caillou, Caillou
They say, I you
No nigga, you me
Even if your bitch by you, yea, I can make her do me
Run Forrest, run, I need ones (Waka)
Now my pockets got lumps and bumps
Like I bought 'em from the swamp
Yeah, my pockets swoll
They swoll like I know the Klumps
I got that gas, baby pull up to the pump

[Outro]
Pull up to the block, I'm celebrated
I give a damn if you care, I'm a astronaut
I shitted on 'em like I'm constipated
I’m there if you care or not
I'm ballin' in there
Don't want no problem bitch, I'm ballin' all in there
Don't need no problems cause I'm ballin', ball, ballin' in there
Hey hey I'm ballin', ballin', don't need no problems cause I'm ballin'
