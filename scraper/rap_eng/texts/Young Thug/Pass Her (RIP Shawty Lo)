[Intro]
Yeah, Slime
Mountain dew muddy as a motherfucker you know what i'm saying
Yeah, yeaah, yah
(Jeffery)

[Verse 1]
Ballads on, feel it in my chromosome
Bad bitch she yellow bone
Tall like she big bird
I'm just get my ball on
I'm just get my snag on
I put a Birkin bag on
Pour up me some Sy-zurp
They drink some water after
Blow smoke into the atmos'
You look like a fear factor
And you're fearing every battle
And your water very shallow
I throw a rack at em
I just ran down on em
I just wanna ran down em
Bitch I'm from Atlanta
We got Iraq in us
We got Iraq ammo
We cook Hannah Montanna
Oh it's sad ain't it?
And my bother def
I know sign language
He wrong, got behind it, ain't it?
Ain't it yeah

[Chorus]
Pass me the lighter
Nigga I'm a soul survivor
Watch me hit the nitron
Busted on her thighs and
Pass her, pass her, pass her, pass her, pass her
Pass her, pass her, pass her, pass her, pass her
Gold in my navel
Go head and pass her

[Verse 2]
I'm preaching like the pastor
Gone on the NASA
I'm just travelling and hotel living
We let bygones be bygones
Don't fuck round and try us
Or your fucked round be dying
I believing in the skies
And all my niggas ridin'
See it in my eyes
I never disguise it
I'm a killer I'm not hiding it
He off your ten toes like the Heisman
Therefore you got the go, got the go
And I don't wanna stop toe
Pakistans shooting at the store
Adidas shoot out in some shell toes
Get a text, let them know it is for sure
On your mark get set nigga lets go
Screaming R.I.P to Shawty Lo
Welcome Guwop Home at every show
And I steal like I damn need
Shawty (?) tryna act like I won't feed 'em
Nigga know since day one I was lethal
Nigga know that my skin is so deeper
Nigga know that my skin is so deeper
Nigga know that my skin is so thicker, yeah
Nigga know that my heart is so bigger, yeah
And I know that these niggas bitter, ah

[Chorus]
Pass me the lighter
Nigga I'm a soul survivor
Watch me hit the nitron
Busted on her thighs and
Pass her, pass her, pass her, pass her, pass her
Pass her, pass her, pass her, pass her, pass her
Gold in my navel
Go head and pass her
