I want you badly, hey

[Hook]
Who would you tell?
Cause I wouldn't tell
I'm scared
Of you and what you can get done to me
Who said they dare?
Who said they dare?
Please free La Flare
I know he gonna be proud of me

[Verse 1]
Take care of that pussy, scared to go in it like woods
She could stay here if she could, suck my banana no pudding
Bitch get your stems out these woods
You know lil' mama got good
Nut on her teeth no bullshit, me and her up to no good
If she ran her mouth, nut inside her mouth
Jump in it no kangaroo, give the bitch a pouch
Put her out the house, she fucked my dog, Chow
He like her cat, meow, champion in the house, hey
She want chill around me everyday
She like when I call her momma bae
I'm losing my voice I can not speak, right, every damn night
We get a kick out it like Spike
Whenever I do not see her she wanna fight
I just wanna hold her like a mic
No Tyson, I won't one night and I wanna wife it
And buy it everything that it desires

[Hook]
Who would you tell?
Cause I wouldn't tell
I'm scared
Of you and what you can get done to me
Who said they dare?

[Verse 2]
Free Gucci!
I want do the hoochie coochie
Have a private party Bentley boolin'
I saw her I was shot like an officer on duty
Um, I don't know what I mean but I know why I do it
Right on time like 12:59 AM PM
I just wanna do, let bullshit out her ear
You know I'm banging red, like the nose on a deer
Why wouldn't I claim her when I put 20 bands in her ear? (icy)
They work at Follies, boy you know they righteous
Bitches super wet just like a porta potty
I been had a check but I still don't like Nikes
Hey, how did you get here this place is where she stay at
I didn't say
