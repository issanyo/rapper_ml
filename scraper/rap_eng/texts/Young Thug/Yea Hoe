Now my old bitch salty yea, she keep calling me
Swerve around that bitch, while she walking, aye
Diamonds on my wrist clearer than Blu-Ray yea
Had to get up and go get it, it was no other way yeah

You told me that bitch was cool, that bitch was loose
Pull up in my Yeezy Boosts

Ya your bitch stuck to me like glue
Counting the money, counting the money, now I'm the man in my city
Fuck with some C's, fuck with big B's, driving around in a Bentley
Went to the hood, got a lil' bitch, bet you Lil' Uzi gon' hit her
Lil' Uzi leave that bitch dripping
She mad at me pull out Remy
Smoking this gas, popping these Xans
Ya you know I'm a lean sipper
Ain't about money why is you talkin'?

Lil' Uzi cool like a fan ya
My new bitch she got a man ya
All these hoes they my fans ya
Walking around with all these bands ya
