[Intro: Young Thug]
Be in your broad
I'm 'bout to be in your broad

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Yeah, top off the Benz (top off the Benz)
Yeah, I done fucked all of her friends (her friends)
I done fucked all of her friends (fucked all of her friends)
Came here to party (skrrt)
Check out the options
I make a moshpit (woo)
I never forfeit (forfeit)
Chanel seats inside the car, dog (I got Chanel seats)
Chanel money, high as the stars, dog (I'm high as the stars)
New Chanel bound to attract the broads dog (new Chanel)
I'm 'bout to be in your broad, dog (dog)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Money in every room that I walk in
I got pigeons in the coop and they chargin' in
Got the Hermès on my drawers as I walk through, nigga (I walk through, nigga)
If you see me, I got jewels, what it do (nigga, what it do, nigga)
Pull up, hop out a foreign whip
I got some guns in the pool pit
And with my car, got a full kit
Don't make me go brazy, go ludicrous
Been doin' for ages, you new to this
I look at the greatest like who is this?
I ball on 'em like I'm Peja Stojaković
I dunk on your bitch with a lot of dick
I'm promisin' to God, I'ma ball on you
I do it for the dogs that's behind the walls too
I ball with your broad, buy her Gucci, Jimmy Choos
Buy the bitch diamonds and the yellow pikachu

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Yeah, top off the Benz (top off the Benz)
Yeah, I done fucked all of her friends (her friends)
I done fucked all of her friends (fucked all of her friends)
Came here to party (skrrt)
Check out the options
I make a moshpit (woo)
I never forfeit (forfeit)
Chanel seats inside the car, dog (I got Chanel seats)
Chanel money, high as the stars, dog (I'm high as the stars)
New Chanel bound to attract the broads dog (new Chanel)
I'm 'bout to be in your broad, dog (dog)

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I fucked the whole crew, yeah, they get exposed too
I call her CNN, yeah  'cause baby, you old news
I hate to say I told ya, yeah but nigga, I told you
Your lady gon' let me paint her, yeah 'cause that what hoes do
I'ma treat you like a queen, yeah 'cause that's what Zoes do
She thicker than cornbread, yeah, I love her like soul food
I eat her like soul food, I'm pullin' up, foreign coupe
Your man don't get no loot, Timberland, I'm on the boot
Your rent is overdue, oh my God, I love my Ru'
You think a nigga soo woo, I'm bangin' on your boo
She follow me like Blue's Clue but I be on the move
Say free my nigga Woo Woo, my snipers on the loose

[Chorus: Young Thug]

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Fuck around and hit your broad, dog
Fuck around and hit you 'bout the sauce, dog
Fuck around and hit it then leave, where's Waldo
Fuck around, sweep her, dig that hoe with that Draco
Go, fuck around, make your nigga brazy (go brazy, brazy)
Fuck around, make your nigga come take me (woo, make your nigga come take me)
We been treatin' your ball like hoes for ages (oh God)
And controllin' your bitch like Comcast cable (facts, facts)
We got the top with the sun down
I ride round the town with the top down
I peek out the covers like clowns
My water gon' drown you, my Bentley truck sound proof, ayy

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Yeah, top off the Benz (top off the Benz)
