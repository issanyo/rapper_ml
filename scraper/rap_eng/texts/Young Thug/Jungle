[Verse 1]
I ball in multiple ways, which means I'm athletic
You been hustling for ten years, which means you bad at it
If a million was nine feet, you wouldn't grab at it
But a cracker got five thousand, you would snag at it
You niggas stupid dumb, which makes me stupid smart
And they be waiting one play while I be playing my part
My diamonds ricochet, them diamonds looking dark
I be in the crowd with my fans, I have a groupie heart
Bitch I be going in, but I ain't naked though
And I be flexed up, I own the beau tux', yo!
Them niggas wifing them, we be on the next hoes
And I kick the super shit, but Boots leg broke
Yeah! And this beat crazy
But I've been fucking beats, that's how I got two babies
Yay, shouts out to real lil' Haiti
What are babies born with rabies, ugh

[Hook: ???]
Cleveland Ave is a concrete jungle (It is)
It's a jungle (It is)
It's a jungle (It is)
Niggas from the ave don't fumble
They can't fumble (Yeah)
They won't fumble
Cleveland Ave is a concrete jungle (It is)
It's a jungle (It is)
It's a jungle (It is)
Niggas from the ave don't fumble
They can't fumble (Yeah)
They won't fumble

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
What's the beefing about? And niggas say they shooting?
Shit, they snuck and shot me, what's the sneaking about?
What's the cheating about? Or they eating what 'bout
Shit, I don't sneak, I don't cheat, I just see and hop out
Then I start gunnin'
Then they start runnin'
And I start runnin'
You know how that go
Where I'm from, niggas might buy a deuce or four
And then later, I'm kicking the door
Big Jumbo fo' sho'
Yeah! Shouts out to the ROC crew
Unfunk I got us, I mean I got you
You like a new pair of shoes, I gotta cop you
And when you get home, I swear they ain't gonna stop you
From doing nothing, shouts out to 2011
Shouts out to all 11 of the kids
And when I talk to my momma, I still sit on her like a kid
And if you have them racks, my ho will sit on you like a wig
Ya dig?
