[Hook: Young Thug]
Cop a Rollie, yes a Rolex
And I pull up on that lil nigga, Bowflex a nigga, know that ay
Where your heart at? I'm gon pour that out like Moet
And she know that she the bomb, nigga, Lotus ay
And the bitch, ya know they fuckin and they suckin
When they get inside the bed with me and  Mayo
And she fuckin' if I say so, plus she suckin' if I say so
And she love it if I say so
And we fuck 'em, we don't pay 'em
How the fuck we gon’ buy if I don’t pay 'em?
I’ma come a week later
I’ma spread that pussy out like a acre
She on the cover of Fader
And she say it’s my time like Flava
Plus I ain't never went fishin, but I bait 'em
And I'm livin' like Flava

[Verse 1: Birdman]
Yeah, got the chopper with the Mac
In the back with the stacks, nigga pull up in a new car
Long nose bout the flow nigga
Pull up out the door nigga, fuck and get a murder show
Been a hunter and a gunna and a stunna
Nigga get money representin’ uptown
Big B’s with a few C’s
For the money it'll be your own people on ya (action)
Big mansion with the OV
Backyard with the young nigga, lowkey
Five stars, nigga, ball like a real G
New cars, nigga, serve it like it’s 10 a key
Got a mill in em bitches
Fuckin’ niggas bitches, iced out, fully loaded
100 mills still flippin
Check a nigga digits, make a young nigga gun blow
Hot nigga, don’t stop
Big money nigga gon’ pop
One stop, get yo life took
Big money, bitches gon look
Flashy classy
For the money we dashing
Fuck em, pass em

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Tell the bitch I’m comin’ over 3 AM
So she betta have her muthafuckin’ clothes off (what?)
One of me, three of them
And ya know that I’m a pimp just booted up, I ain’t bout to doze off(nah)
Lil nigga, you a shrimp walking' with a limp
I ain’t have to say a word the bitch took her clothes off
Love shit to make me sleepy, love Xan, love percocet
All these drugs got me throwed off
I love my bitch, I can’t go without her
I'mma give her my seed, no sunflower
I got strong genes, my little boy look just like me
I ain’t tryna be with your woman, I one night ya
Pulled up with that nigga bitch in the car
Now her baby daddy wanna fight me
That pump, man, make him jump, man(fa fa fa)
You would think his ass was sponsored by Nike
I’m every little kid’s idol, got more verses than the Bible
The lifestyle I live here priceless
Pull up on yo ass like a diaper(what?)
Grippin on my nuts like Michael(hey)
I see shit before it happen like a psychic (I do)
Get yo bitch, don’t want that broke ho around me
And me and Thug still on the run so fuck yo bounty (forreal)
I love my girl so much, that money, I let her count it
(Thugga, tell 'em)

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Call yo bitch and tell her I need some mechanical
Plus she make me stand out like a ruler
Even though I don’t got all my strolls
I’mma pull up on lil momma with the doors off
I’mma treat myself and buy myself a rollie
Then I walk into a party full of cougars
This just might be an interesting white-t
Yeah nigga, this a crew cut
Crew cut, momma say yo crew cut
On that GT, pop for me oooh-ee
And she come and let me ride like Uber
Then I teach lil momma how to ride it smoother
Baby girl, gimme clues, no blues uh
Parallel, I fuck her right by the Buddha
Baby, all on my Insta no -tution
Hate leavin’ me when she go to school
Kendrick, look I’mma dive in
Got her ridin' round with me, make a play
Make her feel like I got tires in it
And I'm sorry I was seein’ yo lady
Fuck bitch, don't ever try to play me
Bruh I’m sorry I was feedin’ yo baby
First time seen a real nigga make it
Sittin at the top, I’m bored no neighbor
(Thugga, tell 'em)
