[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got a half bird in my M2
Ya'll nigga flexing, ya'll nigga fool
Hundred k on her, hundred k on me
Got shiny shoes, got shiny jewels
Ain't nothing blue, they red clues
They at you, and they next too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
36
For a brick, too legit to quit
Michael Vick, all my dogs yeah they with the shit
Catch a point, shake him up like a hit stick
Your bitch is... on my dogs like a fucking tick
(Skrrt, skrrt) Straight up out that bowl with my fucking wrist
I ain't going to jail, so I gotta hit
Ain't shoot him in his ass, but I'mma bust his shit
I ain't 3hunna, but I'm Sosa bitch
My patna got the plug, he serve him everyday
Real ice inside my wrist, you can just skate away
Stay hot you think I live outside the equator bae
Don't play because them sticks sound like these 808s

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got a half bird in my M2
Ya'll nigga flexing, ya'll nigga fool
Hundred k on her, hundred k on me
Got shiny shoes, got shiny jewels
Ain't nothing blue, they red clues
They at you, and they next too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too

[Verse 2: OG Boo Dirty]
I'm flamed up, my block hot
Hundred bands in a shoebox
Still no gang, keep a Glock cocked
Spit more fire than a matchbox
Full cup of that Actavis
Yellow diamond like I'm dripping piss
Call me H-boogie, you know I move bricks
Thug right beside me, call him Money Mitch
I'm a Memphis nigga, hard on a bitch
All my life I been breaking tricks
With the mob squad I might spaz out
See too much cash I might crash out
Walk in the club, iced out
Neck and wrist, lighthouse
Ya'll know my life about
Rich nigga, walking stash house
Balling like Jerry Stackhouse
Bad bitch with me, hit the room and knock her back out
Crusing through the city, me and Double D
Just made a hundred thousand, selling pints of G

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got a half bird in my M2
Ya'll nigga flexing, ya'll nigga fool
Hundred k on her, hundred k on me
Got shiny shoes, got shiny jewels
Ain't nothing blue, they red clues
They at you, and they next too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too

[Verse 3: Heavy]
Everything I do, yeah I do it to make a profit
Me and Money Mitch got your bitch right here menage-ing
Me and Bo jug just to count them free dollars
(?) going crazy, love to shoot that damn chopper
He run the mob, bitch, BMG we taking off
Salute to real niggas who done made theyself a boss
He say that main bitch I just had her at the loft
Boss was on that molly, she was licking like a dog
Ay, that there irrelevant
I'mma paper chaser motherfuck a bitch
I'm cooling with my youngins on some hood shit
I'm so fuckin' hood, I need a hood bitch

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got a half bird in my M2
Ya'll nigga flexing, ya'll nigga fool
Hundred k on her, hundred k on me
Got shiny shoes, got shiny jewels
Ain't nothing blue, they red clues
They at you, and they next too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
