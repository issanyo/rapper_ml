[Chorus]
We sitting at the top of this motherfucka
You can get knocked off of this motherfucka
Try not to get knocked off of this motherfucka
Cause at the bottom it's the blood suckers
And I've been chasing this money for a moment, but I'm still in strive
And when I catch the bitch, she gon' die
I'ma kill you bitch!
The shots out the five, I'll eat you alive
I'll eat you alive!

[Verse 1]
I'll eat a motherfucker alive
Y'all niggas flexing, you are welcome to die
Stop playing, bitch, we multiply
And then divide y'all, then hide all
Hey, fuck the law (fuck)
Fuck the cops (Fuck)
Bitch, I've been the boss
Drop bombs on anybody's shit
And head to your crib, and fuck anybody's bitch
Y'all old, bitch we on some new shit
New cars, new homes, new bitch
Hit the club and pop the same old shit
And if you don't like it, nigga fuck yo clique!
Yeah!

[Chorus]
We sitting at the top of this motherfucka
You can get knocked off of this motherfucka
Try not to get knocked off of this motherfucka
Cause at the bottom it's the blood suckers
And I've been chasing this money for a moment, but I'm still in strive
And when I catch the bitch, she gon' die
I'ma kill you bitch!
The shots out the five, I'll eat you alive
I'll eat you alive!


[Verse 2]
Free Unfunk, free Dulo
Free Zoo crew, free zoo crew
This a horse, not a deer on my shirt
But there's a deer on the verge
And write me there first
Haha, sincerely yours, Thug
Shouts out to Slug
Hey, shouts out to my mug
In my jail like sometimes, you know I got a plug
You think they pop them paralyze pills, they laid up
You think I'm popping extensions in the trap, I stayed up (bars)
To me, you're a bug, I just bought some 22s for the coupe
Three letters, called 'em Uggs, I mean Thug

[Chorus]
We sitting at the top of this motherfucka
You can get knocked off of this motherfucka
Try not to get knocked off of this motherfucka
Cause at the bottom it's the blood suckers
And I've been chasing this money for a moment, but I'm still in strive
And when I catch the bitch, she gon' die
I'ma kill you bitch!
The shots out the five, I'll eat you alive
I'll eat you alive!

[Verse 3]
This verse should have went first, hearse
Plus your hands are getting too big, it's gonna burst
I'll eat your ass up then, burp
Then hop up in the phantom, don't pull the curtain
This weed is so loud, I can't hear you
Yugi bear ass little niggas, I can't fear you
House 20 minutes from Lennox, I'm not near you
Sniper Rifle your ass, with the chopper, I dare you
I'll give nigga some sense, I'll deal you
Jump to the bullshit, the money I hear you
Play with any nigga in my crew, I dare you
And I'll eat you alive, I'll eat you alive

[Chorus]
We sitting at the top of this motherfucka
You can get knocked off of this motherfucka
Try not to get knocked off of this motherfucka
Cause at the bottom it's the blood suckers
And I've been chasing this money for a moment, but I'm still in strive
And when I catch the bitch, she gon' die
I'ma kill you bitch!
The shots out the five, I'll eat you alive
I'll eat you alive!
