[Hook: Young Thug]
Turn up on they pussy ass
Fuck her in her puss and ass
Turning green like the damn bags
Homie say he worth about 100 squares
Damn, these niggas make me laugh
How the hell these niggas make me laugh?
Shad said you made him laugh
Laugh laugh laugh laugh!

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I got jewels just like Santana
You ain't even earned a bandana
You ain't even got no damn manners
Wearing cherry blossom, I fell down laughin'

[Verse 2: Shad da God]
Look, I'm punchin' in, they spot be open like some damn sandals
I'm pourin' Act I'm trying to contaminate the damn Fanta
Light yo' block up like some damn candles
We just got the fold-up yopper with the damn nana

[Bridge: Young Thug]
Away, yeah
Spending racks  everyday, yeah
Living life feng shui
Fish scale, no bait, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chinx]
Double park and hit the hazard
Lick a shot and ditch the plastic
Turn up on they pussy ass
Nigga hid 100K up in the attic
Move the work, I had a few runners
Came up in here looking like the new hundreds
Pistol on my lap in case a fool want it
Yo' bitch bust it open for a cool 100
People rush them doors and they gon' have to take us all
Stack my paper to the ceiling, nigga, talkin' Pau Gasol
Ain't no clothes up in my trap, I told yo' bitch to take it off
Niggas came up out them jects, dreams to be up on the Forbes
