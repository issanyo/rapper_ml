(HOOK)
Yeah
Roll a joint, got a point
Sick of beats, blow that coin
Smoking weed with my g's
Blowing O's and getting rich
Don't ever smoke that seed ×2

(VERSE 1)
Set me dreams high and I didn't ever doubt, now I'm 15 already I'm moving out
Dropping out of school and move to a new town, focused on my music and made it a new sound
I flew down like I was an angel of God and they can hate if they want but I ain't dealing with shit
I be taking their spot with all the lyrics I drop, so they all got reason to be pissed, bitch
I play with words just like a game of Scrabble, with a point to music but they mainly ramble
Then I'm trying show this whole game's a scandal, with every song I put up on my phone
Like Swine Flu, I've got to spread my lyrics, what I do is gonna hurt your feelings
I've got IQ but no perseverance, you're a human body but a worm in spirit
So learn to steer it or you gon' run in the dirt, and add another fucking colour to the front of your shirt
And now you wonder why the numbers come to me and you're hurt, talk shit I'll make you suffer like a mother at birth
A mother did first but still people saying I changed, gotcha thinking every statement in my lungs that I made
I promised all my fans that I would stay the same but they broke the promise when they gave the fame
Get a bag, of OG
Make sure there's no seeds
Yeah I rap and I grow weed
Y'all gotta roll with me
I might eat it, I might lick it
But I swear I'll never bite it

(HOOK)
Roll a joint, got a point
Sick of beats, blow that coin
Smoking weed with my g's
Blowing O's and getting rich
Don't ever smoke that seed ×1

(Verse 2)
It was you who didn't believe in my dream, now I make a lot of money while you struggle to eat
You said the views and the music wasn't for me, now I'm abusing and using my power to be
The greatest on the mic, no other way to say it, say it
Actually I'm not, I'm stubborn and overrated
Acting all hard and calling a song 'Famous', still I had a dream and the balls to go chase it
While you sat in the class, I rapped what I felt now I'm stacking the racks
Every single rhyme is a masterful plan, I attack with a pen and a pack in my hand
So fuck the people tryna jack my bread, I'mma act like Jesus coming back again
Cause you see me in the sky while you're back on land, and I'm always on a rise with the cash in hand though..
They say we fly as fuck cause on the billboards, we're always higher up
And that fame makes the women fire up, until they shred my back just like a tiger cub
And that's wild love, now we're getting frisky
Sipping liquor, quicker, gripping whiskey
Stripping bitter, Twitter bit this quickly
To consider me just as a little fishy, it's a little risky
Like Finding Nemo, lost at sea with memories of people
Calling me the remedy for evil cause I fall asleep and everything is peaceful
Smoking diesel mixed with chronic just to find my place and keep my music honest
Now they use my name to try and gain a profit, but low-key I'm getting famous off it

(HOOK)
Roll a joint, got a point
Sick of beats, blow that coin
Smoking weed with my g's
Blowing O's and getting rich
Don't ever smoke that seed
