You keep dat bullshit on yo mind
You keep some bullshit on yo mind, man
But I'm gon' help you take it off(take it off)

Take it off, yeeeeah
Hundreds, thousands, millions, OUCH!
Hundreds, thousands, millions, OUCH!
Hundreds, thousands, millions, OUCH!

[Verse1]
Me know them lil' niggas keep that bullshit on they motherfucking mind
Make a nigga drop a dime, Pussy niggas know I'm never slipping I'ma pop it every time
Wet a nigga polo t-shirt up , 12 think he spilled wine
Niggas know I'm banging in new York, if I ain't got a stick , you getting buck now
Nothing you can tell me that'll make you sound real
Nigga jewelry water, no boat [?] cologne [?]
Judging by the lie detector test, nigga you will never get a deal
Just got of the phone with Unfunk
He just have been waiting on a appeal
You step in my lane we clashing like titans
She notice them slimes , like them bodies
I popped me three caps of them tridents
We fucking in ranches no jolly
Popped me one more capsule I'm higher than scotty , no lyin
But you gotta be silent. Girl, you know we in the lobby

[Verse2]
Catch him slippin , take his life at the red light
Throwin them bands, this a cash fight
Rich homie thugger anyday, that's a [?] night
Colonial flow, im just tryna get my bread right
I know you lil niggas ain't gonna pull that on me
Front a hundred bands, that's gon' get ya right
Pink rollie, or the Breitling
Thugger killing mics, Tyson
Do not play with me, know it stay wit me
Used charge for lunch now she suck dick for free
Feeling just like Future, I know she notice me
Young Thug RO5 OG
