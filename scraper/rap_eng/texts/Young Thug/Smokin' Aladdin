[Intro: Young Thug]

I can fly, YSL we can fly
Oooh yeahhh... yeah

[Hook: Young Thug]

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I believe I can touch the sky
I believe I can fly
I smoke the kush and these niggas smokin' Aladdin
We smoke the kush and them niggas smokin' Aladdin
Light up a L and I know them bitches ain't ready
Light up a L and I know lil mama ain't ready, ain't ready

[Verse: Young Thug]

Steady screamin' Y-S-Izzel
Spotting bitches through these Garcizzels
Them bitches cost them bands man
I think they came with sizzels
I'm still smokin', they still light skinned
I just wanna smoke, I just wanna smoke

[Hook]

[Verse: Dun Deal]

Amen Slime God but...
When you list the blunt you call it the Dirty Diana
Hey, I'm on one and right now so it's hard for me to see
But I got ass in my lap, pass that
Don't drop no ash in my lap
I'm talkin' cash maybe racks
I'm glad you brought your judge so gimme that
Pour up, boul up shit
I'm still smokin', they still light skinned
I just wanna smoke
I just wanna smoke

[Hook]
