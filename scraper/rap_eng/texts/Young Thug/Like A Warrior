I live my life just like a warrior
And I’m a motherfucking warrior
I live my life just like a warrior
And I’m a motherfucking warrior
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
And I’m a motherfucking warrior according to the score
The  in there, your ho in there, your bro in there
Got a spot that was so much weed you got to mow in there
We took em out, he had more in there
Kicked him up his ass with Jimmy Cha and Jimmy Cho in there
Bitches see me in that Honda Civic, want my digits
Want my ticket, they can’t get it
They get nothing but these kitties
It’s impatient in the city got me frigid, but I’m getting it
It ain’t only [?], spot just beatin just like Nitti
Get the bags out the trash can, see too much weed I’m gon spaz
Shotgun nino mash, YSL swag
Rock clad, I’m gon take his ass
One cap out no pass
We too bad, RIP to [?], free my nigga Nash

I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I live my life just like a warrior, I know that nigga up to something
He standing in the cold with no coat, catch a dime bag with an O and wipe your nose
Stay cold cause that pole on his throat
Hit the jeweler, leave out froze, my diamond blacker than coal
Her pussy dripping, all my pimping
I’m a hippy, know she with it
Get on the plane fuck up your city, my diamond’s bleeding, Wicced’s pissing
We going in just like [?], she on the stage showing her kitty
Thug tattooed on her titty, I look like a ton of midgets
Speaking of midgets, got a [?] if you want it, I’ll go get it
Make one phone call to the [?], they gon pull up right here with it
We not worried bout no jacking, that’s a ticket, no lieutenant
You know DK gonna squeeze it till it’s empty

[Verse 3]
I live my life just like a warrior, my skin red like Seminoles
Speaking of red, my pen is sponsored by red bottom
These bitches want everybody, my whole crew they got problems
They [?], they gon' kill that, we can’t stop them
We just looking like a profit in the club, they know we got it
Hit the club looking like Pac, we got muscles just like Rocky
Got all of these bitches bossin' for my bosses, plus your posse look like pasta
We don’t beat em, we gon' eat em, we gon' feed 'em to these divas
Yeah these divas run with heaters, senorita, hasta la vista
They two piece ya, then they leave, for your maker
No Anita but I'm baking, lots of pizzas what I’m making
[?] cheetahs
I got acres sitting on acres, motherfucker
