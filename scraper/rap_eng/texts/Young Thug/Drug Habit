[Intro]
Thugga, Thugga
YSL stoner
Get it

[Hook]
Molly purp and lean I got a fuckin drug habit (lean lean)
Wake up in the A8, I had to have it
Giuseppe walkin dressed all up in fashion
The forty on me can't let them snatch this

[Verse: Young Thug]
Young Thugga Young Thugga
I give the racks to my brothers
Call her one time everyday
Eat her for dinner and supper
Hercules hercules hercules
Pockets swole now they work for me
Feed her the dick call it jerky please
Complete a sin now she worship me
Oh my God, oh my God, stabbing these bitch with this sword
Racks got me hard, spend a fifty on my fraud
My gators hard, six rings on me I'ma lord
I need a Nicki Minaj
Racks in my front pocket lookin like tart
Wake up out my sleep and pour a four (lean)
When I get through with that four I hit the floor
So many bands I can't even travel with none of my bros
These hidden paths, we ain't gon' (?) these hoes
Oh no, oh no oh no

[Hook]
Molly purp and lean I got a fuckin drug habit (lean lean)
Wake up in the A8, I had to have it
Giuseppe walkin dressed all up in fashion
The forty on me can't let them snatch this
