[Intro][Written by Theuri][Voice-over by Theuri]
Okay, I'm reloading
It's not my voice to tell you to know your place
But thy will show you the space
Wednesday, July 4th, Atlanta, Georgia
75 South, exit T-41, Cleveland Avenue
5000 bricks, 50 bloods, 25 choppers, 10 cooks
5 houses, 3 trucks, 1 Young Thug
You do the math
Rich is for bitches, wealth is for bosses
