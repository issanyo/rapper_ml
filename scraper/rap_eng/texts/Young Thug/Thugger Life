[Chorus: Young Thug]
Aye (Drink!)
Take a little sip of that act' (Blow it!)
Flood all my bitches in that (Then what?)
I'm in the projects without pat
My jewelry leave them blind like bats (Bling!)
Diamonds for her in the back (Blow!)
Hit that little bitch from the back
She stack
And bitch like "How I do that?" (What)
Pop a little xan' and relax!
Look at my racks you get wet
If he got racks he get text
Five, four, three, two, one a tech (bitch)
All of my woe they sit back
Pussy niggas they some rats
He swung on my pockets they fat, no cash
But all my bitches they brats
But all of my bitches they practice
Take a little perc' and relax!
Turn up, turn up
These niggas up to something
She need to fuck or something
