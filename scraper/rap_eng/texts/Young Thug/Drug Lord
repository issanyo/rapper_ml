[Verse 2: Future]
Drug lord
Cookin' dope on the G4
I'm a motherfuckin' drug store
A hundred bricks, I'm the ski boat
Miami vice, had to condo
[?] with my wardrobe
I'm a motherfucking cocaine boy
Ran my check up, went and bought my own bank, boy
I came from Africa, touch down, whats on that drank boy?
I took a pill, I'm on the lear, lear, lear, lear
Came in the cell, came in the cell, cell, cell, cell
Everyday Sunday for us like its LIV, LIV, LIV, LIV
C-O-D and ain't gon' work for no deal, deal, deal, deal
Spray the car, spray the car, you gon' get switched up
Pray to god, pray to god, you don't switch up
Ever since a nigga was born I was t'd up
All summer on the jet with my feet up

[Hook: Future & Young Thug]

I'm a motherfuckin' drug lord
I'm a motherfuckin' drug lord

Aye, drug lord
Fuckin' drug lord
Drug lord
I'm, aye
