[Verse 1]
Two door coup four hundred chips
Jacob watch cost two bricks
Throw another rack if she do a split
I got a bag of mollies know she want to lick
Make a girl kiss a girl, turn this shit into molly world
She geeking off of them drugs, making faces like [?]
Don't need a compliment cause I know I'm the shit
All this ice on me I done froze in this bitch
Look like I'm selling dope, nigga stove in this bitch
All this girls want to fuck like gold on my dick
Everywhere I go you know this shit lit
His Rolex ticking that nigga counterfeit
Bitch from the [?] screaming free [?]
I only blow gas don't fuck with the mid
Diamonds flashing like paparazzi taking pictures
I don't fuck with lames I fuck with real goons killers all my niggas they the realest
Flockaveli 2 on the way I see these pussy niggas catching feelings
It ain't personal it's just business I'm the realest
Come fuck with me let's make millions

[Hook: Young Thug]
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets
