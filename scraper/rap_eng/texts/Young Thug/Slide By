[Verse 1]
Met her at the Petsmart (what you did after that)
Put her in that leg lock (okay then what)
Hit it backward in a headlock (man I'm feeling sick)
Performing surgery, she my head doctor (don't drop a dime)
I had to call her one more time (why you had to call)
I think she slime, she looking lime (tell me what you told her)
I told her, "throw it baby for me" (slow it down)
She kissing on me like she know me (ay)
She said fuck that she want the old me (the old days)
She got a few bitches for the homies (bring 'em out)
Now I'm so lonely, lo-lo-lonely (hunnid k)
Like when I hit the dentist (and she wish)
She said baby she not even finished (she not finished)
I put Fendi under my linen, nope
Tell me she don't got time for them women
I'm eating at Five Guys, I'm a fly guy, but as much as you can slide by, ah

[Chorus]
As much as you could vibe by, ah
This what you would abide by, ah
We living in the sky, ah
I left her then she cried
I got as much as you can buy
I got as much as you can fly
I got as much as you can slide by me

[Verse 2]
These niggas small to the Thugger like they bushwick
I fuck that bitch right on the floor, that cherry wood shit
I told them niggas if they scared hit that pulpit
This ain't no hope but it's a dare, you not doing shit (fucks)
Yeah, Snapchat me that pussy bitch
Bitch I'm the shit, on my wrist it's a full brick
We pop it off, won't bow down to the bitch (nah)
You can tell I'm fly by checking out my chick
If you think I'm gay, you can come check my dick (check it bitch)
If you think I'm sweet, I'll let you take a lick (lick it bitch)
If you want that molly, I'll give you some grits (woo)
My breath smell like some Trident, put it on your lips (ha)
I can take yo broad with my black card (black card)
These days, lotta pussy niggas act hard (act hard)
We the crazy jokers, we gon' pull ya card (pull it)
Big ol' pool in the backyard
We can tie some ties, if you get this shit a fly by, ah

[Chorus]
As much as you could vibe by, ah
This what you would divide by, ah
We living in the sky, ah
I left her then she cried
I got as much as you can buy
I got as much as you can fly
I got as much as you can slide by me
