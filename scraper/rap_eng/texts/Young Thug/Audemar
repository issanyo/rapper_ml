[Chorus: Young Thug]
Ridin' in a new Maybach, dunk on his ho like Shaq (yeah)
Jimmy Choo shoes relax, Givenchy socks to match (come on)
I was just smokin' on thrax, now I'm playin' with that sack (catch me playin' with that sack)
Pussy just fall in my lap, money just chasin' my back (just chasin' my back)
The gang came back with racks, I'm ridin' 'round town with a Gat (Gat)
I'll beat a nigga face with a bat, pink slip, paper tag (ayy)
I bought me the new Hellcat, I'm blowin' in a new Hellcat
I walk in the club, Hellcat, 85 racks, Hellcat

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I eat the steak with the crab cake, I stuck my D on her chest, yeah
Baby "Tip Drill" with a passion, crib came rusty like trash can
I need my bags, man, I'ma come through like Aladdin
Audemars jacket, Audemars coupe was matchin' (Audemars, Audemars)
Audemars black sand, Audemars [?]
Audemars pack in, I just got some Audemars thrax in (got my thrax in)
All of your Act stashed , all of y'all Act gon' stash packs (stash packs)
All of y'all ass fat, Audemars with a passion (all of y'all ass fat)
Audemars, Springfield, Audemars, drop top Bel Air (slatt, slatt)
Audemars paralyzin' drip, Audemars wheelchair (slatt, slatt)
Audemars handmade (yeah) Audemars billionaire (yeah)
Audemars blue and red (ho), Audemars float, yeah (Audemars)
Audemars wrist band, Audemars, Rollie face Ric Flair (Audemars, Audemars)
Audemar wrist splash, Audemar splish, splish, splash (Audemars, Audemars)
Audemars whiplash, shawty got Audemars big ass (Audemars, Audemars)
Turned my chips to cash, I don't mean to rack up the millions

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Ridin' in a new Maybach, dunk on his hoe like Shaq (let's go)
Jimmy Choo shoes relax, Givenchy socks to match (come on)
I was just smokin' on thrax (huh), now I'm playin' with that sack (I'm playin' with that sack)
Pussy just fall in my lap, money just chasin' my back (just chasin' my back)
The gang came back with racks, I'm ridin' 'round town with a Gat (slime)
I'll beat a nigga face with a bat (face with a bat), pink slip, paper tag (yeah)

[Verse 2: Tracy T]
Yves Saint Laurent just to match it, Christian Dior with the ratchet
Audemar, make it do magic, Audemars, I want that Patek
Audemar make her come out of her panties (slime, slime, slime)
Come with that water like I'm at Atlantic
I land in a jet, just to pick up a package
I land on your bitch, just to bust on her mattress
I turn her back 'round and I bust on her backwards
I got a hoe, but that bitch call me "daddy"
My money long like the '73 Caddy
Bring in that work we gonâ€™ weigh it and bag it
Don't come with it shawty, might shoot 'til it's jammin'
In the back of the Maybach I got on that fashion (ho, woah, woah)
He got on Richard Mille, that shit ain't average
My bitches I bought 'em some titties and asses

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Ridin' in a new Maybach, dunk on his hoe like Shaq (let's go)
Jimmy Choo shoes relax, Givenchy socks to match (come on)
I was just smokin' on thrax, now I'm playin' with that sack (I'm playin' with that sack)
Pussy just fall in my lap, money just chasin' my back (just chasin' my back)
The gang came back with racks, I'm ridin' 'round town with a Gat (slime)
I'll beat a nigga face with a bat (face with a bat), pink slip, paper tag (yeah)
I bought me the new Hellcat (what?), I'm blowin' in a new Hellcat (yeah)
I walk in the club, Hellcat (yeah), 85 racks, Hellcat
