She was a friend of Thugger, now she a friend of Scotty
She was a friend of Thugger, now she a friend of Scotty
Baby I want your pizza, I want all the toppings
Baby I want your pizza, pizza, I want
So bad I swipe my visa, visa, I want
Turn to pink just like Easter, Easter, I want
She was a friend of Thugger, now she a friend of Scotty
She was a friend of Thugger, now she a friend of Scotty

[Verse 1]
I'ma do my best, like the fifth-grade test
Gotta make it to the six, my bro gone buy me that new vet'
No Michael Vick, but these bitches want a dog like Lil Tic
No homo, but my blunt look like a dick
Punchanella, punchanella, I'mma make it rain
Bring your umbrella, check the schedule
I can lick your ear soft as a feather, hello
How ya doin'? This for my neighbor, Carmelo
Brainwash, brainwash, little buddy got me brainwashed
I can't think twice, I want her some more
I want her remorse, I want her remorse

Turn to pink just like Easter, Easter, I want
She was a friend of Thugger, now she a friend of Scotty
She was a friend of Thugger, now she a friend of Scotty

[Verse 2]
I got three best friends, they tell me about all of my hoes
You wanna bool with me? Call them 500 on my clothes
We build our unity, I got them young nats calling me early like on truancy
They wanna get with me, make a flick with me
Thugger Thugger, baby, take her to Italy
I'm too up, I get the birds for like ten-a-piece
And therefore, I'm on the road I know she missing me
But I'mma leave early to take her ass to Tiffany's
Birds fly high, but you fly higher
You got a man, and I don't want to but I got to despise you
For dinner time, come heeere, come heeere
