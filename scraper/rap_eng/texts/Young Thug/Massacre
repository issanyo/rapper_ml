Massacre

[Verse 1]
Abracadabra, bae
Run, don't get captured
If you got the apple
We pop you like Snapple
Hope you got collateral
’Cause this a battle
.45 in my coat, Minneapolis
You can't let that [?] put a cap on it
And you know he not friendly, no dappin' it
Hell of a fight ’cause all are some savages
Who the fuck tryna win and live lavish

[Chorus]
Ma-ssa-cre (woo!), la-la-la-la-la-la
Ma-ssa-cre, war ready baby
Ma-ssa-cre (yeah!), la-la-la-la-la-la
Ma-ssa-cre-ah-ahh

[Verse 2]
First I rob you then come back, man
Who the fuck tryna do somethin' about it?
I'ma get that bitch inside the shower
Then read it to her like a browser
Uh, yeah, this stick can multiply it and go divide it
If you really 'bout it take that mask off your face
And don't try to hide it
Don't disguise yourself (La, la, la)
Unless you need help (La-la-la-la)
Known to come by myself (La, la, la)
Meet me at the steps (La-la-la-la)
Look at the camera, I'm there (La, la, la)
I'm not scared of death (La-la-la-la)
Plus I’m the reason that you wanna shelf (La, la, la)
Play the cards that was dealt (woo!)
Live life like the Joker
I thought that I told ’ya
You know me, I'm not local
I’m one with that [?]
You the bomb baby, lotus
But I'll take your soul out
And I'm tryna take you all out
Put bombs in your girl's scout

[Chorus]
Ma-ssa-cre (woo!), la-la-la-la-la-la
Ma-ssa-cre, war ready baby
Ma-ssa-cre (yeah!), la-la-la-la-la-la
Ma-ssa-cre-ah-ahh

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
La, la, la, la-la-la-la
Ma-ssa-cre (woo!), la-la-la-la-la-la
La, la, la, la-la-la-la
Ma-ssa-cre, war ready baby
La, la, la, la-la-la-la
Ma-ssa-cre (yeah!), la-la-la-la-la-la
La, la, la, la-
Ma-ssa-cre-ah-ahh
