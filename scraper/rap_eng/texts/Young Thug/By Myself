[Hook: Young Thug]
These niggas phony I can't hang with no one else
I've been riding by my muthafucking self (Yah)
Three-way menages by my muthafucking self
I caught a body by my muthafucking self
Just copped a mazi all by my muthafucking self
I’m moving lilly by my muthafucking self
I, know, you, want, me to, do it all by myself

I hope you got your goggles on

And different chemistry and special chemistry

These niggas phony I can't hang with no one else
I've been riding by my muthafucking self. (Yah)
Three-way menages by my muthafucking self
I caught a body by my muthafucking self
Just copped a mazi all by my muthafucking self

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Get ready, by myself
Good head, by myself
I got cottage cheese, made it by myself
Pocahontas hair found on her ass crack
Put that stingray motor in a jag
Fruity pebbles dancing on my wrist
Today I, rock blue diamonds like a crip
Today I, I took your wifey like the rip
Floyd May, I want big diamonds in my ears

[Hook: Young Thug]
These niggas phony I can't hang with no one else

I caught a body by my muthafucking self
Just copped a mazi all by my muthafucking self
I’m moving lilly by my muthafucking self
