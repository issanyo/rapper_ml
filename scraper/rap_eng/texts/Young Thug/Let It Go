[Intro]
I cheated on my fears i broke up with my doubts
Got engaged with my faith now I’m marrying my dreams
Ralo… Its the Diary Of The Streets nigga
My nigga thugga called my phone, he said where you at lil bruh
I  said shid Im in the bluff
He said man you crazy as hell you a million dollar nigga
You need to let that shit go now
Real talk  fam goon

[Verse 1: Ralo]
These niggas better duck before the get taped up
Ill put em on that plate an they'll get ate up
I done blowed out all of the candles lets pick this cake up
We them niggas they cannot handle I know they hate us
I told my mama she gone see me on that big screen
The judge gave my partner fifteen he was just sixteen
He told me just to take care of the kids and don't forget me
I told em if he need anything you can just hit me
I told my nigga dont never talk, all of these bitches be droppin salt
I did that shit that they never thought, I buy the shit that they never bought
I know it look like we never lost, me an my niggas will never fall
He go to jail ill accept the calls, Im the one sending them letters off
We ain't stun no bitch, We ain't stun these hoes
Im with the niggas who never told, we fuck they hoes and we let em know
I used to stand at the yellow store, thuuga keep tellin me let it go
Remember when we just sellin dope, thugga keep tellin me let it go

[Interlude: Young Thug]
Naw for real dog, Let it Go
Man you gotta press up on a nigga know what im sayin, Let it Go

[Interlude: Young Thug]

[Verse 3: Trouble]
Stay solid stay free what i told em, stack pray an stay out the way ain't no foldin

These niggas ain't solid these niggas ain't real, its only a few niggas chosen
These niggas gone squill these niggas gone tell while im yellin free my lil whody

Talkin big money shit slime so much that shit open
Talkin shit but scared to approach me, i heat this shit up like some folgers
