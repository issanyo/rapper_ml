[Hook: Young Thug]
Do it by myself
No, I don't need no help
Woah, woah, Balmains with a belt
No, she can't get inside my whip
No, no

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Hand me that molly, hand me that molly
I'm sneakin', I'm lookin' mischevious
These bitches gon' show me they bodies
And they not strippers, they asses so real, temperpedic
Pop one, pop two, then I go trident
Then I'mma fuck that lil bitch, it sound like someone knockin'
I'm covered in green like a goblin
And I fly round this lil bitch like I know they can't stop me
Pass me the deuce
I'mma hit 'em in the club with the deuce
Index finger makin' love with the deuce
Smokin' when I show the show how to do
Mink for everybody come in the crew
Not a single nigga dub in the crew
Slimey snakes, now she lovin' the zoo
Fuck with TIP so I bought me some AKOO
Treat her nice and now she love it
Ass so big I want to hug it
Her mouth gon' open like a buggy
No pistol I got that hoe bustin'
Got these niggas goin' out and cussin'
5 4 2, traces 2 1
I promise I ain't cuffin' that bitch, ain't in custody
I'm not pillow talkin' 'bout nothing

Bitches can't step on my garment

Braid my hair back, call it crochet
Im gangster like clich√©, and you know I'm bringin' it on
Yeah I'm bringin' it on, toast and a cheer cause I'm bringin' it on
Packer yeah, Packer yeah, cheese on ya head like a muthafucka Packer yeah

Suck on that dick 'til you make that muthafucka stand like a tower yeah
Fuck that lil nigga, don't get mad he broke, that's why he actin' sour, yeah
Nigga need to go and get they self some money
Nigga nigga thought the words from my bunny
I took Molly, now I'm holdin' my tummy
Foreign bitch got me speakin' ebonics
Pull up boy, you know all my cars are runnin'
Buffalo car,  my sofa like Jumanji
Bring that shit to me, fuck the price it's nothin'
And I don't need help I can
