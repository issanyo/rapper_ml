You dig what I'm saying?
If they all hundreds I'ma count it fast, yeah
Wanted money, I couldn’t enjoy a class
I'ma big old player, I got it from my dad, heyy
Lil' mama dig what I'm sayin
Keep it funky like an egg and you will never land
All my niggas they don’t play, they all want it bad
My son a boss, he a little bitty motherfucking man
I go crazy, I go brazy for these fucking bands
Fuck a lady, I replace her for these fucking bands
He so crazy, I’m not lazy, I want fucking bands yo

[Verse 1]
I’m a boss, fuck that bitch out on the balcony
I might take a picture and tell 'em to caption this
When I'm done fingering, I need a napkin and shit
Ocho Cinco, yes sir I’m catching it
Catch it, catch catch it, catch it catch it catch it
I'll take your necklace, I'll leave you neckless
I might not be cuzzing but I ain’t bluffing
Niggas want problems, it's not nothing
I'm screaming bring it on like Gabrielle
I’ma real big dog, I don’t kiss and tell, hell
First you want it then second you pale, yeah
Don’t think he quick he pulled up like a snail, oh

All my niggas they don’t play, they all want it bad

Fuck a lady, I replace her for these fucking bands

Yes sir baby, yes sir

And I got on Chucks but Young Thugga not stuck
Swear, swear swear, I swear I'm slimy
You break a rule on him or her, you get fined nigga
These niggas know I run it up so they don’t try, nigga
I might screw you bitch with my broke pliers, nigga
Hell yeah, all my cars they go fish tail
Hell yeah, I'm YSL 'til I'm dead and pale
Kickin you niggas, getting money slow just like a snail
I told her the mail is how they send them bales

I came a long way from shopping at clearance sales
She let me come in her hair just like some gel
I’ma real blood I know you smell
