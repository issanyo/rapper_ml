[Intro - Young Thug]
This is just like, some YSL takeover typa shit, know what I'm saying?

[Bridge - Young Thug]
I'm saucing on everyone

Real bad bitch she'll play, today

Big up, big up to everybody balling
Big up to everybody tryna fall in
Big up to niggas that be flossing
Big ups

[Hook - Young Thug]
Take a trip and land in Dubai
Lens so long I see days in the stars
All my (?) dripping like a staff
Big dog status baby roar roar roar!
Going brazy, Tasmanian
I run it up for a better life for my son
Take a trip and land in Dubai
Take a trip and land in Dubai

Trade lives for my tie just to get away I, I
