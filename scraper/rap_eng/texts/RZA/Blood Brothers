[Intro: The Rzarector & (The Gatekeeper)]
It is written (manifest)
That all men are brothers (prophecy)
We come like blood brothers (word is bond)
'Cuz blood is thicker than water (a-alike)
From the misty grounds (from the unknown)
The shadows (the deep)
The darkness (the triple darkness)
Gravediggaz (my blood brother)

[Verse One: The Rzarector]
I grew up in the violent island of Shaolin
55 Morris, 6th floor, 10th door
When "Jackpot" Watt was hot, I was not
A rusty-ass child with tears and snots
Acquired the knowledge how to master my thoughts
My skinny frail body couldn't fuck with the sports
Six feet two, still wack on the court
So I stalked New York with a black pitchfork
My style date back to ninety-watt
Conion box, Wallabee Clarks with no socks
Remember the days before your pants would sag
Puerto Ricans on the block just throwin' up tags

[Verse Two: The Gatekeeper]
Yo, I was born with a rusty spoon as a mouthpiece
Life was hard cause the graves was my company
Hang with my problems as his trouble predicted
To cross the path, as I laugh at the victed
No warmth for sure, the vents would spit average
Watchin' devils, fiend like a savage
Blood brothers need me call (ooh-ooh!)
In a minute, a minute, Ghostface and all, check it
RZA, Grym and the Undertake
Devil's get baked, I'll sniff your ass like a eighth
Tortures and screams buildin' up my steam
Death do us apart rushes through the bloodstream
Yo, something ain't right, I don't get it
I feel a vibe, blood brothers, are you with it?
If I have to choose one or the other
Back the fuck up, spook, yo, that's my blood brother

[Hook: The Grym Reaper]
All, all, all in together
Blood brothers all in together (X4)

[Verse Three: The Grym Reaper]
Back in the days of Lee's and BVD's
I grew up deceived by wicked enemies
My lifespan began to dim in the era
When you can't even trust the man in the mirror
Now Gravedigga niggas receive my trust
And like Christ, we walk among the thieves and the sluts
Night brings stress like skins on PMS
The street's a bloody mess, there ain't no EMS
In sight my thoughts are to leave the slums
I hustle with beats and drums, not kiâ€™s and guns
My feet are numb, as I walk my dogs
I cut off the flaws with the Gravedigga swords
Life parole, as me and my man is violated
Hookers are neutered and spated
Snakes are decapitated and castrated
Niggas is lost, your whole ark is bein' raided
Shows today are hectic, niggas'll wreck shit
Lick off rounds and jet quick
This piece is gettin' heated
Foes are rushed and stampeded
Devils are all defeated by the blood brothers

[Hook]

[Verse Four: The Gatekeeper]
Yeah, as the earth erupts
I conduct to destruct your flux when I big up
Catastrophes are blasphemy
Pour a container of brains on your grave through a strainer
I capsize your coffin, I wreck your morphin
Can beat devils down like Steve Austin
I gotta rip on a peel for a meal
Let's get some God degree
'Cuz a blood brother's hard to be

[Verse Five: The Rzarector]
Power equality, Allah sees equality, follow me
Law and order but it's thicker than water
Many heads got slaughtered back in Latin Quarters
Like this brother named Rick was slick
But got bit by the same mothafuckas that he ran with
Band of the hand, the Clan's my fam
Something mom-dukes could never understand
From the grave to the gutter, death to another
Who try to fuck with my blood brothers

[Hook]
