[Aurore Perchet in French]: We might not understand each other
[Moongod Allah in Dutch]:  Knowin' the pain of suffer
[Cilvaringz in Arabic]: And though our skin-color is not the same
[Barracuda in Italian] We are equal since we came from one mother

[Cilvaringz]
Yo...Yo, I'm a virgin that attacks like a tiger
My stars represent the light because I eject the brighter
Dart, form the shinin' forum in the wigs
Ninja stars givin' brains homin' instinct
In bliss to be linked with the Gods of this shit
It's Born-Born, the double nine echo it
So fuck it if you're rich or struggle for coins
Allah's finger never avoids the 108 pressure points

Aurore Perchet (in French): We might not understand eachother

[RZA]
Yo, yo, guns splatter, bones shatter, erase your life data
The crowd scatter, bitches sayin' 'what's the matter?'
Bob Digi, notice hoverin' your city
Flashin' the W, that represents the Witty
Unpredictable Talent And Natural Game slanger
Put all that water-down Hip Hop through a strainer
The drained alphabet soup from un-recouped coups
You featherheads, I come to battle you on your stoup

Aurore Perchet (in French): We might not understand eachother
Aurore Perchet (in French): We might not understand eachother
Moongod Allah (in Dutch): Knowin' the pain of suffer
Cilvaringz (in Arabic): And though our skin-color is not the same
Baracuda (in Italian): We are equal since we came from one mother

[Cilvaringz]
Yo, some seek the wise to escape the wars of
The Angels of Death strike the lambs blood on their doors
Indicate their fear of the expeditious prince
Evaporatin' bogus niggas with the 26 poisonous
Razor sharp double edged ninja stars
Meth vs. Chef, nah Bobby vs. bars made of silver
Slither down your chamber with the RZA
Rusty killer scissors cut you right infront the Wu-Villa

[Baracuda]
Yo sharp as fuckin' scissors, or beats that by RZA's
This guillotine regime fatal flyin' Kju's denyin' everythin'
Includin' workin' with the government
My tactics, Killa Beez practice, upon the Atlas
Poisonous forbidden styles white tiger rappers
Slap this, we spar at the Wu-Palace
7 star, Lama style, Ninja Starz, killa bars
Martial darts, we're Wuniversal Gods
