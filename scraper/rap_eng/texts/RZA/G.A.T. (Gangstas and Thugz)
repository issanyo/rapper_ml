[Intro: Miko the Pharoah (Christbearer)]
Yeah, North Star, what? (Yeah, ye-yeah)
(Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah) What? What? What?
(Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah) What? What? What?
(Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah) Christbearer
Ye-yeah

[Christbearer (Meko the Pharaoh)]
Christbearer make 'em all fall down
'Til they kneal and get the feelin, Motherless and Heaven-bound
(Heaven-bound)
Don't ask me why I chase the cat
Or do the dog-catcher with a rat 'til the dog spawn crack
Killa Beez attack with D's on the Lex and the cleavebacks
With Siamese macks (Long Beach)
Now girls, release the hounds
We impeach, that Caprice the ground (Yeah)
Beat up all dragons, but we unleashin now
Run the beast through towns 'til the beef is ground (North Star)
Now, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
And sweet baby James in the black flames
With the Carolina in my mind, searchin for a rhyme
Came back with the black sunshine
And fuck ya friends, all of them come and go (Yeah)
And they never come to see you when ya money gets low (Low)
Then let the record show that you could never love a ho
In debt to treat the baddest bitches like so-so (so-so)
I'm from the N-O-R-T-H where niggas is forged to G cakes
With the three eight's, sedate, niggas that caught a gate (What?)
See people make the world rotate
And I give 'em God in the flesh, the ass to test the vest
Stress and manifest success
I make 'em all say, "Yes", impress and address
The G.P. like L.S.D. (Uh-huh)
I'ma take you out way out (way out) where ya never been before
Into the coke and they laid out
Hittin California corners in the legs
Hittin Tony Romma's with the police on us (on us)
(One) And I don't give a fuck about the cops
With Mac in the peanut cups, spendin the high rise

[Doc Doom (Meko the Pharaoh)]
Gangstas make the world go round (Long Beach)
North town, Comp-town, puttin it down, Cali bound
We smoke, we joke, in the city of dogs and locs
Don't get ya pass revoked

[Shyheim]
We smack niggas like you and tell 'em, "Go get ya gun"
As far as I'm concerned you could suck dick and swallow cum
I'm God-son, the rose of salvation
Product of the ghetto, I'm the street's creation
I'm move like vampires, only at night
Hand grip like pliers on the Glock with rapid fire
Goin haywire, I stab a nigga 'til my arm gets tired

[Solomon Childs]
Thugz make the world go round, bloodhounds
Body Brighton town, Now Born town
Staple-town, Park Hill bloodhounds
Thugz make the world go round, world go round

[12 O'Clock]
I'm Brooklyn bound, I break ya ass down
Hardcore type sound that vibrates the whole ground
Around and around, where I stop, no one know
But if I'm comin ya way, best bet to get ghost
Champagne to toast, all cheers to this host
I rock coast to coast, any state that I approach
When catch the blast of a blunt of a Philly
I get crazy stupid, I got more bodies than Billy
The kid drops rhymes wit a mind like Einstein
Never the swine, I love my family cuz they mine
Check out my shit when I slam from my lips
It's never no riff cuz my people come thick
It's 12 O'Clock in effect gettin wreck
See I pack a Tec if some beef on ya projects
Nevertheless, I rock and roll like Elvis
Stay fresh dipped from the feet to the pelvis
Thugz make the world go round, world go round

[Christbearer]
Gangstas make the world go round, world go round

[Solomon Childs]
Thugz make the world go round, world go round

[Doc Doom]
Gangstas make the world go round, world go round

[Meko the Pharaoh]
Meko the Pharaoh shootin down niggas with black arrows
A soldier from the Wild Wild West
Rollin through city streets in a North Star vest
Funny niggas get scared as fuck quick
Cuz they man didn't learn to duck shit
Now that nigga's duck sick, from the flick of the wick
Media 'vict, deep shit
Women and man starts to happily flip
When I grab the mic grip, start tossin up shit
Y'all niggas never thought North Stars would make it
Now ya gettin mad when ya girl starts to shake it
And Wu-Wear, the Wu-World Order
North Stars wet niggas' ass like toilet water
Cuz gangstas make the world go round
Gangstas make the world go round, world go round

[12 O'Clock]
Thugz make the world go round
Thugz make the world go round, world go round

[Christbearer]
Gangstas make the world go round
Gangstas make the world go round, world go round

[Solomon Childs]
Thugz make the world go round
Thugz make the world go round, world go round

[Monk]
Gangstas make the world go round
Gangstas make the world go round, world go round

[Shyheim]
Thugz make the world go round
Thugz make the world
