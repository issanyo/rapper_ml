[verse 1: zay zippers]
Enter the shaolin, dragon on a mountain, dragging on a loud spliff
Tasked to bout the masses, (who, wait, what? where, why?)
To the greater seat, vaders what I'm catering, faded till the pain deceased
Awaiting all my fantasies, creating till the fans in seats
Elated then to panicking, manic bastard, rascal lipping cactuses
Cackling then back to patent patting pretty ass again
Fabulous reaction, colder than the coolest kids moving to a cooler than
Spewing sewer synonyms rooting from his tooth again
Bruise and dip it's coolish fool cuz I'm a proven hooligan
Few assists and fewer shits than listening to tunechi spit
Forgetting you, like a chick that's chewing rufelin
Isn't new to him, limitless like cooper flicks

The booze is skipped

Ride
Ride
Until you
Die

Ride
Read boooks
This is
The book of war

[verse 2: zay zippers]
Hoodie up, mic wrapped, doobie for the night thrash
With more morgue, than the nigga, driving ms.daisy had
Hustle for them ducats off his hazy ass
Sys-of-stem, ritalin gripping him of the sane he had
Write a labrynth, breathing heavy through vaders mask
Maniac, struggle with the stroking so the paintings bad
Edward scissorlips, bit of snip to fix them achey gnads
Take it dad, dipped a little fast soon I'm making cash
Inherited angst wear it and make it last
So i'm, fixing to grip a litter of chips to taste it and
Show a couple niggas I'm laced in the meth
Face it I'm best brazen the sess and I'm breaking bad

[verse 3: Lonz]
Life is unexpectedly recollecting a mess of when a friend
Became the enemy never mended or stress it ever
Its catching leverage headed over the hedge an when
This coon is spittin oozin in cups overflow its true
We tend to do whatevers pointed at us
That second thought will hit ya head after he's cornered that, yupp
An zippers knows about the fucks that he stuck
An its trippin cutting through crust
An hes ripping rust from his lungs but its done
Your welcome

[verse 4: zay zippers]
Listen bro, can't anticipate that misanthrope
System slow, and planet of the apes where he insists is home
Black mask so it fits the cloak
Badly cast jolly roger to assess the boat
Flag gully parrot on the shoulder spitting figaro
Shut up shut up i am flexing get it? bitch I'm swole
Little known fact, i am Killer O
Young jinchuriki on the track spitting literal
Chakra balls at wack niggas little bold
Raps till the centerfolds, you asses are in menopause
And lacking all the criticals, stacking all these faggots like its average and habitual
Lastly I'm finished, getting mad because my dinner's cold, porridge
