[Intro: RZA]
She just keep tellin' me things, things, I don't wanna hear
She just keep tellin' me things, things, I don't wanna hear
She just keep tellin' me things, things, I don't wanna hear
She just keep tellin' me things, things, I don't wanna hear
She told me that she love me, oh man, yo
She just keep tellin' me things, things, I don't wanna hear
Yo, yo, yo, there's a special Canon camera pointed at me
Making a movie as we do this

[RZA]
Yo, she told me that she loves me, then she says she hates me
She seen me with my new girl, now she wants to rape me
Maybe get me up in court, so that she can scape me
In front of the judge, your honor, it's his baby
She told me my head is funny, I'm just big dick and big money
So I let her fuck me and spend me
But she ain't walking away with a penny
We was like Mork & Minky, yeah, we was like Mork & Mindy
Yeah, nigga I told her I was from space, and this girl believe me
I told her I was a clone, and they was probably three of me
We out at the movies, she could of sworn she saw me
Yo, yo, anyway

[Outro: RZA]
She just keep tellin' me things, things, I don't wanna hear
She just keep tellin' me things, things, that I
She just keep tellin' me things, things, I don't wanna hear
She just keep tellin' me things, things, I don't wanna hear
She just keep tellin' me...
Sin switched it right there, I almost had it right there to
