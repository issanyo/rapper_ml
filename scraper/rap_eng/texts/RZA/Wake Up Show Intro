Previously on Good vs. Evil

[Interlude 4: Eminem]
I live in a world
That's different than your world
Your world still believes in things like free speech and democracy

[Interlude 5: RZA]
This is Bobby Digital
Contacting you from cyber space
The puppet master and his minions have penetrated into our dimension
We need you to make a full on attack
His evil dark forces can't be allowed to spread
This is a code red
This is a code red

[Interlude 6: KXNG Crooked]
I'm here to kill the puppet master

[Interlude 7: Announcer]
The puppet master was destroyed
But there was no time to celebrate
Because a new evil was awakened
