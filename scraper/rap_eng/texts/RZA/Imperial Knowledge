Verse 1

Yeah
Every time I reach for the sky the doves fly above
And every time I  to write my thoughts begin to flood
Blissful Ignorance
I paint these pictures with a pen so those who listen can picture it
Imagine the time spent crafting all these damn sentences
Been thinking of a mater plan
This sh*ts gotten outta hand
Trust myself with my property call that Sh*t a promise land
1st place and 1st class but I'm standing last
Terrorism on my mind that's a Jimmy Neutron brain blast
I'm here to make history f*ck a time machine
Historical figures crafting the sky of the lyrical pilot team
Develop the perfect scheme
I'm successful on a microphone
But I'm dropping tapes low key
Guess I'm goin prone
I live the life of an unperfected
But being a perfectionsit is my Occupation
And a relaxation and watch suspended animation

Verse 2

Never Achieving something that's less than a fantasy
Put hard work in the equation make it a reality
But how do you realize progression the past you've been making ends up an aggression
You try hard and create an ultimatum of your succession
I experience the light with my 5 senses
I done watching these rappers deliver the wrong message in the game while I'm sitting on these benches
These verbal avengers has reached it pinnacle
I'm an emperor trying to have a better future
Im positively imperial
You take Serial
I take it Serious
I catch a progress
Regardless never the less
Let success deal with stress
Until all I have to confess is that I become the best
Know the speech from my talent
But leave the worship to God
These celebrities think they're immortal but that's just a terrible fasade
