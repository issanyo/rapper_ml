[Suga Bang Bang]
It's time, it's time to come again
Summer time and spring time long gone again
Anything test, anything gone drop
Tellin' me "Blood muffy run, blood muff gone fi run"
If a sound test I tell 'em rude boy come
Bout them 9 millimeter in the nineteen top
And don't test me, now
Don't try me, now, now, now, stallion, stallion
Ain't lettin' anyone done come test me
Now, now, now, now, now, now
Stallion, stallion, stallion
Ain't seein' them let done come, tellin' me murdered dim him him him
Nuna-nuna-him-him man a run dim dim dim dim
Knew dem know that me no take back no truck
Come my Glock bark me .4-5, licka licka shot
Tell another sound boy this, I must pop a shot
In them tears, him back, tell him must fall back (Wooo, wooo)
Tell em tell em tell em, round go away
Round go way, tell 'em don' come and test, tell 'em don' come and test
Me another champion, means another champion
Who dat talk? Who dat talk? Who dat talk? Who dat talk?
Suga Bang Bang tell 'em homey run on the spot
And the cop wan me merk me and me nah licka shot (Wooo, wooo)
Stallion, stallion, stallion, stallion, stallion, stallion
They don't know me
Body bag cannot try him
Know me, know me, know me, stallion no forgot
Nineteen ninety nine, boy me radiant love
Tellin' em cock back the big ten dem call to us
And we even fuck de pussy hole, the wrong come test
Hear me no hear me, hear me
And them don't see me, see me
Say why them try me, try me
And no ready to hear me, hear me
Pay attention, but with premonition
So tell em a champion, why me nah run? (Wooo)
Don't don't try try to test a champion champion
If you not ready ready ready ready ready (Woah)
Stallion stallion stallion stallion, eh? eh? eh? eh? eh? eh?, sound boy
Wu-Tang come again, come again, come again, come again
Do you want to come test a champion
And he not ready, ready, ready, ready, no
8 or 9:30, in a Sunday morning
I'm been smokin' since my grandpa, grandpa, grandpa
He say "Ill little youth man, don't move too fast, too fast, too fast"
Cuz this crazy, crazy world, that you livin' in
They don't understand, no they don't understand
Son me live a little kid, tellin' me a reality
And they say some come as GTT, and some come of them 5%
And some of them come fight me, lyricists are easy
And some of them come fight, but me nasty
Come test test tellin em jockey
And tellin me right 'pon the ease, is it easy
And some of them don't know me me me me
Me do well steady, and me world for the love
But they want come fi test
And they don't ready ready ready ready
Feel this
