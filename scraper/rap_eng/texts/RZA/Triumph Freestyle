[Crisis Corleone]

Learned a lot of shit I didn't care to know
Been shown a lot of things, but I pick and choose what I show
Can't grow, if you wanna keep the weeds around
Can't appease rats, if you're trying to keep some cheese around
Careful what you say, and who the fuck you speak around
Cause when you fall, they gon' celebrate you being on the ground
They rather see you in a grave, than to see you paid
Rather say you ain't real, than to admit they're fake
They're Plate watching, like a umpire
But with me one strike, after that, then it's gun fire
Second chances, only help em' plot your death better
Catch you while sleeping, and they'll turn you into a bed wetter
....berrettas solve whatever problems they pose
Sip amarettos, chill in chancletas with hoes
Niggas eating with they foes, that's shopping at Trader Joes with em
Safe and sound, killaz surround me like Bose system
I rose different
With morals values and principals
Niggas think we twins, we ain't nothing identical
If it's fuck me, then expect the reciprocal
Come at me sideways, I'm clapping from my perifial
Gats, scratched off serials, trigger finger itching
Put jewels in my music, because stick up kids is listening
Over your head, it wasn't made for your comprehension
Real niggas decode the messages that I be giving

Corleone, I'm nicer than Jamaican weather
From the pulpit, back to the bullshit, Mason Betha
Ughhh!!!....I don't play bout my cheddar
I have the goons hopping out like the Foot Clan, did for Shredder
Your best is my worst, I'm only getting better
Had your bitch, on my dick before I even met her
You hating on me, only made her interested
You telegraph, when you pass, so I intercepted
Except it, I'm that nigga that you wish you was
Like Foot Locker workers, everything offical cuz
The bitch you was, contradicts your G' today
Standing with real niggas, don't mean it wash your sins away
Maafuckaz got the game twisted
Who you're riding with, don't mean your lane shifted
You're still the same sucka, that you been slime
I just call it how I see it, FaceTime
Niggas history, tell you why they a bitch to me
I'm in they ass like edemas, cause niggas never shit to me
If you ain't real, I don't expect you to feel me thou
But if you fake, I bet you wanna kill me thou
I purposely be shitting on you homie
At the dice game, I'm Goldie, to you Mr. Pretty Tony's
Your bitch chose me...
But can you really blame her
Shorty was wilding.. my dick's a bitch tamer
