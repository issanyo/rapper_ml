[Intro - RZA]
OK (6eme)
Yo check this out
Yo from the Temple of Shaolin
This shit is 6eme Chaudron
Bobby blastin live, come come come come come
Bobby Digi Digi, yo throw the gems
Yo throw the vets sound in son
We gonna blast these in the niggas one time
BOODOODOODOODOO
Digital, Digital
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby
Digital (Arsenik)
So check this shit out son
Digital..

[Couplet1 - RZA]
Bob Digital, the Arsenik, tragic rap combo
Bangin on ya head like bongos, BOODOO-BOODOO
Shaolin and my niggas from Congo
Zaire, West indees, Senegal burn like Arnold
Schwarzenager, too me Vegas was the orchestrator
Pull the loop from his screw-based computer data
For you analog cats, yes we remain loco
Wu-Tang sounds is stranded and gone gogo
You smell the weed stench, my fat twelve-inch
You can't comprehend, I'll explain it in french
I make friends de la club with cross beats and cross guns
I may pawn with the big tits and cinquente long
Ecoutez to the Bobby Digi shit
And Arsenik, you fuck around you get ya wig split
You repair, I restress, "sentir" la flavor
And sometimes I rap a francais
In US rap, you get smacked off the map
And attacked by the black gat, you can't adapt
Pssshh..

[Refrain x2 - RZA)]
Come come come, Shaolin 6eme Chaudron
You get blast by the black gun, gun

[Couplet2 - Calbo]
Oui...l'sixieme ..shh Shaolin, Ã„rsenik, Wu! Le boxon
Au box-office on fout l'souk, avec les mots nous boxons
Nous boxons la bande-son
Toujours au top sans chichi
