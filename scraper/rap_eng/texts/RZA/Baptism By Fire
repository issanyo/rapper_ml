[Intro]
Be careful when you're crossing the street
"At night, we make fire, and have our tea, and we listen for the ninja who never makes a sound."
That's us

[Verse 1]
Yo, shoveling dope to the bellhop
Gunpowder smacks in the shell, making the shell hot
He sell Ope, He sell coke, He sell pot
With the same logic that’s gone and made hell hot
I drop bombs that’s gon’ give you the shellshock
And in the end, he ain't gonna go and sell crops
So here's the plan, set up in Room 112
I have equipment planted right up on the shelf
This a place for drug dealing, so no sparking or lighting
And don't be a stugaz and double park by the hydrant
At 12, Cartagena will go in the elevator
With a couple of boys, get out the couple of toys
Drop the C4 down in maintenance hatch
And please get the fuck out before you go and get clapped
It's gonna blow up and the elevator will fall to the bottom
Any survivors? No, good make sure the police don't spot 'em
Burn any evidence, and disfigure their corpse
To throw off any suspicion and to go add some salt
Look you know I like you and with all due respect
But I take care of my business and move on with the next

[Verse 2]
Kill Iceberg, let’s keep it real Iceberg
You look like you’re packing some steel Iceberg
I hope you’re not afraid of me Iceberg
You gotta put your hands where your eyes can see, Iceberg
Look in this war, we’re both cool Iceberg
Even though there’s conflicting loyalties, you bring bitches to school Iceburg
It’s your birthday huh? That’s dope as hell
Want some cake? I hope it goes well
With your status as a pimp, you’re expecting a stripper
But we found out where she lived, here’s a confession, we clipped her
We dumped her body in the basement, let it decay
They won’t find the body for weeks, so let me just say
Instead of a hotty jumping out of the cake
It's one of my goons with a shotty and considerable weight
I like you, and I wanna let you slide
But what’s to stop you from coming back? So now you gotta die
Look you know I like you and with all due respect
But I take care of my business and move on with the next

[Verse 3]
Just gimme yours, I’m so uncut raw
I’ll cut your throat like your hairline, with a buzz cut saw
Look I feel for you, we all got problems
Except I’m your biggest one, and you can’t go to the cops son
Listen I want everything you have, I have everything you want
Your family in the trunk of my car, I’m so bizarre
I’d have you shot by some fat old lady who’s walkin’ her dog
Sosa you level headed so you’re a threat to my cause
Even if you sent cops to arrest me I could grab you through these bars
And with the pin point accuracy hitting the center like darts
Look, you and Giancana run the show
He’s the brawns, you’re the brains; he slips while you on your toes
Visualizing the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who’s the baddest, a person’s status depends on salary
Remember your words, as that old lady walk by
She blast you, and then she’ll snatch your shit as you die
Look, you fuckin' scary so I had to rub you out
Now onto the next guy I have to go and snub out

[Verse 4]
I got a body bag with your name on it
Same shit, everyday gonna blow your brains on it
You strangled the pope with his rosary under the orders of your compatriots
I’m not afraid, get your face and put the case in it
I’ll pull the rug that you use to pray East out from under you
Even Muhammed struggles in fear, your momma scared to be lovin' you
You think I haven’t heard bout ‘73, ‘86?
Your reputation precedes you, on some crazy shit
You made your bones killing squads of Viet Kong
Same place of Uncommon Valor, Vietnam
In Eighty Six served 15 for shooting the Mayor
Stabbing his son with a razor, boombox blaring out Slayer
You the muscle, so I’ll admit I’m startled
You hit hard, I’ll hit harder tho; leave it hard to
Fuck it, I’ll send a platoon of corrupt police to your door
Wash my hands with your blood, deal with the problem no more

[Verse 5]
It’s a shame that I gotta take you to war
Executioner style, put your face on them boards
But I got money on my brain, I’m blowin’ up in the world
I’m on my road to the riches, but I’ll always want more
I’m a greedy piece of shit, I want all of the pie
I’d live and let die, but I’d rather live ahead of the time
Me and three other goons chase you for my wealth
We chase you cross the country, I’ll finish you myself
I got a bullet with your name on it, number one
Former boss of the Luciano family, so I got my gun
Now you on the run, we shooting out each of your tires
Ambushed while you selling drugs, peace while you die sir
We cornered you at the same gas station you ran to
Years ago, in Mexico; shoot the pumps and blow up while you ran through
The place where you rose is the same place where you fall
Heed the words of God and answer your call

[Verse 6: Kane & (Raekwon)]
Fuck it, while I’m going with my crew to take down the don
I got hitmen who put a bunch of needles in their arm
Tony Starks and Lou Diamond pushing the same H on the corner
So I got the hitmen as the customers pretending to order
Their pay, the heroin that they got in the car
Just be careful of the witnesses nearby in the bar
Packing .22’s and .38’s in the jacket pocket
And when they backs turned, you know that they’ll blast and cock it
The plan is afterwards, they get the H and they run
Any come back alive to me, then I fulfill the pay stub
If one of them ends up in jail, then they’ll overdose
No witnesses to escape alive, burn ‘em inside; call that Jehovah’s toast
The plan’s set, they walk up ready to purchase
Gave the both of them money, “Hey, thank you for your service”
They pull it out, the guns slip and fall out
Graze Tony in the head, one of the guns stall out
Two of them get shot by Lou Diamond in the neck, mate
Tony Stark’s 12 gauge shotgun, into your breastplate
Fuck they all dead, what the fuck we gon’ do?
(You done fucked with us so we coming for you, nigga)


[Outro: Raekwon]
Don't worry (Beep beep)
This motherfucker isn't gonna get away with this (Beep beep)
We'll get him (Beep beep)
You'll see  (Beep beep)
