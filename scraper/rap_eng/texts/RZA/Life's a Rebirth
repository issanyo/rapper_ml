[Intro: RZA]
With Lester Kane's revenge complete
There's only one thing left to do
Logan begs him to stop, but Lester does not listen
He puts the gun to his head, and pulls the trigger
Killing himself with honor
Seconds before Lester's final breath escapes his body
Ghostface becomes consumed by a diabolical revelation
Inhabit the flesh of his young son, and he could live as a reincarnated Tony Starks

[Verse: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo fuck it, I'm taking the soul of my son
Live through the eyes of my young
We gon' rule, conquer, pillage and destroy
Bulletproof shit, blast through alloys
But first things first bitch you fuck with the worst
Logan, I'm about to quench ya thirst
Put two to your head, leak brainial fluid
(No please! Starks, don't do it!)
Bang bang, no more time for compassion
My reactions to your action: Satisfaction
No more DeLucas, the rise of a new day
Hey, hey, Mr. GFK
The rhymes of the black suits no longer play
I'm avenged, a proud man walking the Earth
Satisfied with my kills and my life's a rebirth
So live long, and long live the illest
Twelve Reasons to Die, Ghostface Killah

[Narration Outro: RZA]
As thunder strikes, and the clouds smother the full moon
The soul of Tony Starks' son is cast into an abyss of fog
And the spirit of Ghostface Killah reascends into his body
Becoming a human inferno of vengeful rage
Logan screams in terror, as she realizes her fate
The possessed boy begins stabbing her, again, again, and again
Now standing alone, blade in his hand, he grins at triumph
*sighs* the sweet taste of revenge
Lester Kane and Tony Starks were nothing more than kindred spirits
Separated by time and space, but bonded together by violence and death
A touch of fate brought these two souls together
But for one of them, the ultimate price was paid
This is not the last we'll ever hear of Tony Starks
Actuality, this is a new beginning
Tony Starks was once a man, and became a demon
But now lives again, in the flesh and blood
Of the Ghostface Killah
