2017
In the year of our Lord
Jade Lotus with a dose
Of accolades and awards
I'm a jack of all trades
When it comes to this sport
And ride off into the sunset
On a fiery horse
I'm flyer than Porsche
911 turbos with that S on 'em
Expect perfection when I flex on 'em
Accept this lesson as your next warning
The words cut like a knife
And leaves legions on ya skin until the
Next morning
When I'm performing I'm pouring
All that I have in it
The birds definitely hit the floor
Badminton
My transmissions are deeper than bass fishing
Opposition gets that limited edition ass kicking
Last of the giants my science is never ending
Atreyu in the fables
I'm fighting for independence
My sentences will finish
Everyone that's in attendance
With the sickest wordplay that's in the business
Now bear witness
To a legend more epic than Gilgamesh
And doper than smoking wet
From 2 dips of that cigarette
(now) stop playing-
Stop saying you're the illest rapper
Only to get all in your feelings
From the realest rapper
Grab ya attention with the visions
Of a vivid passion
(and) watch them hang my home jersey
From the gym rafters
A stroke of genius from the master
With the green jacket
Triangulating my location like I'm
Gene Hackman
Never looking directly at the satellites
Cause with line of sight
They'll see exactly who I sacrificed
So after I steal the blender (and)
Get the camera from the children
I'll hop in my camino
Grab the cat and burn the building
Jade Lotus
