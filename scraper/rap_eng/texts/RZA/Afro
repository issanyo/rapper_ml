[Verse]
My pop said
I was addicted to the music

That's the water
Word to Mick
No use trying to dilute it

I could push white
Like daisies
Chase pink like tulips

But I rather compose
And sing songs from my two lips

I've got no use for substances
But I see people abuse em

My aunty on crack
My uncle strung on this liquor

Floating through his life
With his feet near the ceiling

But the homie stressed out
Cause he living near the killings

Son became a product

Brother died from dealing

But it's better to have him drunk
Than have him stealing

Or feeling Women and children
Like the sickos on the news

I caught this teacher dude
Getting brain after school

Ol' girl was failing class
Until she did the extra credit

And now her ass sag
Because she's pregnant

Thank god it ain't mine
Cause I've been hitting too

But when they throw it at you
It ain't shit you can do

What you expect
The media's been riddled with sex

And she needs to escape
From the pain and the stress

But she doesn't understand
Her actions are making it worse

She doesn't have the type of attitude
That would let her discourse

Ever since she was little
Her parents have been divorced

And she doesn't have the courage
To let them know it hurts

So she been living life on her own
With no regrets

No parental advisory
And no safety with the sex

But her boyfriend gang affiliated
And she feels safety with the set

But they share the same goal
And she ain't safe yet

Now she feels used and abused
They were looking for something

She won't let it get worse
She ain't looking for comfort

She's looking for freedom
Found 44 cals
Now she's longer breathing
