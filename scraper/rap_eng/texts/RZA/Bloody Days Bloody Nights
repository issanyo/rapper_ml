[Intro/Chorus: Thea Van Seijen]
Bloody days, bloody nights
I will never give up on the fight
Is my soul, up for this right?
Is my heart, struck for this plight?
Many days, many nights
Never felt this strong in my life
Youthful heart, belongs to my knight
Is my soul, up for this plight?

[Prodigal Sunn]
Kill 'em... kill 'em... uh-huh, kill 'em...

Yeah - pages in my heart, you ripped the family apart
Insanity sparked, my soul fill in purple dark
It's murder from the start, survivin like Noah's Ark
I'm Alpha Afro, hit 'em with a thousand darts
You left us for dead, my blade sharp drippin red
It's barefaced cool and no doubt I'm here to take your head
I'm at the pearly gates, my mission to terminate
A guilty conscience only leads to your bloody fate

[Chorus]

[Outro: Thea Van Seijen]
Youthful heart, belongs to my knight
Is my soul, up for this plight?
Bloody days, bloody nights
I will never give up on the fight
Is my soul, up for this right?
Is my heart, struck for this plight?

"The headband shall be, ours!"
