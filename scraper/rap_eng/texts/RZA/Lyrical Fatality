There's a thousand ways to die, Homie
Now take one
I shall confiscate (SHAO KAHN)your soul like I'm Shang Tsung
With no flaming skulls just removing the mask
To spit fire
Watch what I do to your ass (get over here!)
Shoot a harpoon to your ass
So damn fast, you thought I launched to to your ass
Two out of the blue, brand new on your ass (sub-zero)
But I was never cool with your ass

This ain't a Friendship, homeboy, you got me mistaken
Your body goes vacant
From me knocking your face in
The rocks in the pavement
Just pop while you lay there
In shock like I'm raiding (Raiden)
Hip hop with a Taser

Shit, you're not afraid
Bitch, I got grenades
I can make your whole world split like Johhny Cage
By the way
I got a thing
For naughty ways
Like pissing the track off just to potty train

Whatever, I'm side track
I guess it's a virus
That you get when you enter net (internet) messaging Cyrax
But never mind that
Back to the violence
Like stabbing your spine

With 9 daggers once I black out, Noob Saibot
If you're getting bored, then it's you I chop
When you hit the floor, then it's you I mop
Tears begin to poor, then it's you I drop (eyedrop)

So they call you Stryker
"I'm equipped with a full clip
Why you think they call me Stryker?"
For pitching
"That's bullshit!"
I'm armed with metal like Jax"
Then make the gun blow
You only drive by when you spin out, Kung Lao
Was so high up, I mean, I'm sad you fell down
And landed hard enough that your back could rep tile (Reptile)

Enough Babality, pass the fire (pacifier)
Before I slap shit out of you to pack your diapers

And quit screaming. That is so Sindel
Waving your hair back and forth like a ho, sit down

Oh you're asking to fight
Yo fuck a jab and a right hook
I'll hack you to plywood
With the hatchet of Nightwolf
Ask (Ax) about me

I never owned a blade
I got Bakara hands, you got a Sonya blade
I'm no Kitana fan, though you might get blown away
Or I just may lean a (Mileena) bitch with body blows from Jade
Your squad will go Bin Laden once I start to go in rage
Shit, I just made Sheeva dip inside of Goro's cave

I'm a motherfucking beast, minus the claws and the fangs though
I'll rip your heart out and make a bargain with Kano
So I could ball (Kabal), earning my spot in the game
Spitting karate-kick-lines, called the Liu Kang flow

You're seconds from harm
I'll take a second to warn you
That you better disarm before my weapon disarm you
I'm reflecting the MOB
"Yo, what he say he was gonna do?
3-2-1 boom and your sector (Sektor) is gone...poof

See nothing but smoke
"What about kintaro and motaro?"
Man, fuck them niggas, they cheat
