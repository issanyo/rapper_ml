[Verse 1: Robert Delong]
I'm looking down on planet Earth
I got a message from the universe
But I can't communicate up here
With the [?] people shouting far and near

You got everything
Cause you can't feel a thing
Yeah you got everything
But you can't feel a thing

[Verse 2]
And I'm just here to make some noise
I've got thousands of dollars and electronic toys
I'll make a bee to make you sting
I'll write a song that you cannot help but sing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So I got everything
But I can't feel a thing
Yeah I got everything
But I can't feel a thing

[Chorus 1]
And I got everything
But I can't feel a thing

[Verse 3]
They're looking up from planet Earth
They ask me how the fuck I get my amnesty from work
They know I live inside a cage
My mind creates an anchor for perception's sake

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Where we feel everything
Where we see everything
Where I am everything
Yeah I am everything

[Chorus 2 x4]
Yeah I am everything
Yeah I am everything
