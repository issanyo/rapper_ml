(Verse 1)
Watch as the Monsoon come
A feral tongue, saliva will have you develop mongoose bumps
In the building, I’m on you punks
Guan Yu buzz, hate shit over these long few months

You ignoramus, Dammit Thor
The world revolves around me, and I’m rotten to the planet’s core
My inner rancor roars
Won’t stop rapping til you’re entire body’s filled with canker sores

Meditate outside heaven’s gates
And play scary music on piano so it resonates
My fans are never safe, dedicate every day
Never hesitate to sedate you featherweights

Leave mercury at murder scenes as a calling card
The verdict seem perfectly neat and jolly jarred
Folly bards play my theme song on shotty harps
More off the rails than malfunctioning trolley cars

(Chorus)
I am a legend, yes yes I am
Purple red, other shades and the best cyan
Crest with a wooden face
Shoulda coulda wait, i’m a hooded footed snake don’t mess, my man

(Verse 2)
Leader of the Z syndicate
Bruce lee in this bitch, see me spin to kick, isn’t it
Sick as spit from a lich, teeth bend and shift
Seize innocent weak penmanship

Please my honor, am I free to barter?
I’m an evil charmer, feel your knees heave in armor
I’m cold already, now I’m freezing farther
Hope this song ends with fire, Ethan Carter

Run up on your crew with a rancid expression
‘cause of me, writing bars is a rampant obsession
Never answering questions, my voice has a candid inflection
I’m Krampus’ weapon

Anchored my ship off the coast of Tortuga
Boast more than you does, I’m poorer than you fucks
I’m horrid, torment courses through my blood
Morph into a porous abhorrent goon with guns

Lavish navigation, having mad elation
Had from my nads' gravitation
Towards you, whores move in admiration
After I’m done staggering I’m back to stabbing faces

And that's how we do it

But this is really how we do it

*Hentai*

Rza : Ha sike!... attacking, attacking, attacking, ATTACKING

Disjointed : "attacking I'm wrappin you bastard now prepare your casket
Death is the final step, when y'all step
To intercept"

Uh... no that's the... d..do the chorus

(Chorus)
I am a legend, yes yes I am
Purple red, other shades and the best cyan
Crest with a wooden face
Shoulda coulda wait, i’m a hooded footed snake don’t mess, my man
