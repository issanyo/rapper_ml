[Intro: Method Man]
Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Ain't what you want baby
It's what you neeeeeeeed

[Verse One: RZA]
Yo diamond crystal rings sharp like icicles
Nickel plated pistols, official Wu-Wear covers my physical
Insulated thermal Wallabees drain they co four butt solos
Photographic prototype static-free motivated soldier
Or Wu say boulder head flower
You can detect the true and living God from his aura
Keep your sword straight, maintain your weight
But he ate too much monosodiumglutumate, and polysorbate
And drunk grape concentrate, with sodium benzoate
Fried the chicken thighs in triglycerides
And his bitch advertised her breast size
Eighty-five didn't realize, til the truth opened up his eyes
Then he became highly civilized
And spent time amongst the wise, went through a garment renaissance
And stopped wearing Benetton
Tommy Hill, Perry Ellis, Nautica, or Liz Claiborne
Ocean Pacific, Fila, Bill Blass and leave fitted
Quit the Armani sweaters with the Gucci wool knitted
Now all he buys, Kani's, Cross Colours, Shabazz Brothers
Mecca, Pelly Pell, 88, North Q, Bear and a few others
For the new year, strictly Wu-Wear

[Chorus: Method Man]
Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Ain't what you waaaaaant

[Verse Two: Cappadonna]
Pelle Pelle had the top dresser
One man catalog the London Fog casual hog
Bear denim with the Cash Wu Nike and Kangol king
Everyday, DLO jacket equipped with the drawstring
Fila supply big daddy Starter hat, The brown-skin derby match the Tommy Hill; Advil
Double button Woolridge, red dickie turtleneck
Mockneck, eighteen carat holdin my twenty-two shine
In this like Macy's or Bloomingdale's
The Century 21 son, the new portfolio dunn
Now it's my time, Asian Wu-Wear, Cappa fleece wear
One wear plaza, Donna hold the best of all year
Plus blue wear, Wu-Wear, what's going on
We're the best of this year, Wu-Wear and fleece wear

[Verse Three: Method Man]
Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Just come see me
Satisfaction guaranteed baby
Just hold your own baby
And just rock on baby
I got this wine on my mind
Feelin fine darlin
Now all you see baby
Ain't what you need baby
I wanna know just how low
It goes
Official nasty asses, straight shots in dirty glasses
Wu-Wear fleece for you and your stinkin piece
Hard time and killer tactics

[Verse Three: Method Man]
Just hold your own baby
And just rock on baby
I got this wine on my mind
Feelin fine darlin
Now all you see baby
Ain't what you need baby
I wanna know just how low
It goes
Official nasty asses, straight shots in dirty glasses
Wu-Wear fleece for you and your stinkin piece
Hard time and killer tactics

[Verse Three: Method Man]
Just hold your own baby
And just rock on baby
I got this wine on my mind
Feelin fine darlin
Now all you see baby
Ain't what you need baby
I wanna know just how low
It goes
Official nasty asses, straight shots in dirty glasses
Wu-Wear fleece for you and your stinkin piece
Hard time and killer tactics
