[Intro]
Fat dub sack! Remix of Method Man for ya one time. Yeah

[Chorus]
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man

[Verse 1]
Hey, you, get off my cloud
See me get raw with my southpaw style
Mover, puffing on a fat blunt from Cuba
It's the Meth-Tical jet to Cal, I'm the Buddha
Monk on the hunt for machine gun funk
I keeps you open like a slug from the shotgun punk
Double-barrel, yeah Meth bring it to them proper
Partner, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Straight up, you moving too fast so baby wait up
Took one, added seven more now you eight up
Get on down with your bad self
Get on down, listen to the sound, come on
Few can ever get this whole commit legit
See you all up in my ass
But you don't know shit, uh-huh
What's your definition of a real emcee
From what you dedicated, hey it must be me
Meth-Tical, a rude descendant of the loud hip-hop
I go on to the break of dawn, and just don't stop
Give me the green light, and the sign one way
Have you had your meth today?
Huh, move it in, move it out
Stick it in, pull it out
Shake it up, shake it down
Come on down, Meth-Tical
Oh I hope and pray that I will
But today I am still
Just a...

[Chorus]
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man

[Verse 2]
Rrrappers can't get with the style, extra wicked
Rap flow is banging like butter on a biscuit
A-tisket a-tasket, I'm not trying to have it
Might show up, stun 'em and run 'em when they ragging
Those who test it, respect it, the method
You know I can't be messed with, I'm hectic, accept it
I'll break it down, I get down for my crown
Filthy, dirty like a worm underground
Trying to avoid the early bird, that's my word
Before I kick the bucket I'm a kick 'em to the curb
Check out the cloud, smoke out from the mouth
Other brothers got mad love new style for the hood, hey
Enter the square if you dare
Without a flaw, I'm so raw that I'm rare
I'm going to the country, I'm going to the fair
To see the senorita, with flowers in her hair
And get mine, cause she love me long time
Bartender bring more wine
Get in line for the...

[Chorus]
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
Here I am, here I am, the Method Man

[Outro]
Wu-Tang, killer bees on the swarm, it ain't safe no more
P.L.O. Style. 1993 to '94, the rugged raw
And we out
[Sample from kung-fu movie]
It's a secret! Never teach the Wu-tang
