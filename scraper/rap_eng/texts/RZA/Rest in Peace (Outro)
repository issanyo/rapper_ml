[Ice Cube] Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
It ain't over motherfuckers
(no shit!)

[RZA]
As we enter, the beginning of the end
(the sounds you are about to hear, may be devastating to your ear)
The end, of the beginning
Fr-from the pits, from the, ark
It ain't over, it ain't never gonna be over!
We got them all-new niggas
Grave, Gravediggaz!
The shadow, the dark side
Wh-when you least expect
Uh-under the bed!
Lurking, lurking! Yeah, forever
Gatekeeper
Grym Reaper
RZArector
Undertaker
There's-the-there's nowhere to run
No-nowhere to hide
It's a suicide, a suicide
Cuz we got the constant elevation, constant, constant
So witness the diary of a madman
Come come, as we bring the sorceress, the sorceress
(I love it, I love it I love it!)
Pass-pa-pass the shovel kid
We gotta dig another grave
One, eight hundred, suicide

[Gate Keeper]
The world it ain't safe it ain't safe no more
The world it ain't safe no more
(repeats until track vanishes)

Gravediggaz *gravediggaz* GRAVEDIGGAZ!
