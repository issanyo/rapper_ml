You're beautiful, you're the flower, he praises you
But if you bloom, he will get you scattered
Stupid. So stupid
I go so stupid singin' my grudge blues

You can accept your pitiful fate
But when you cry, he'll make you cry more
Women, oh women
It's women's tears that makes my grudge blues

I hate you. Full of regret, never forgiven
Try to erase my memory, but cannot forget you
It never ends, never
It never ends, 'cause that's my grudge blues

They say it's a dream, embers of one-sided attachment
Laughing at you
So you decide to wake up, but fear to be fully awake
Women, oh women
Women's soul beats on my grudge blues

Crimson roses have its sharp thorns
Don't wanna hurt you, but have to stab you with my thorn
Burning, it's burning
It keeps on burning within my grudge blues

No flower would bloom on my dead body
So I will live along hanging on my grudge
Women, oh women
My woman's life belongs to my grudge blues
