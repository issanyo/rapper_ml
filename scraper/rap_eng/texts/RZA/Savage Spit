You either kill or be killed that's just reality
Barbaric with my tongue I'm like the hun I spit savagely
Body counting Casualties, fucking with formality
House full of dead rappers flowing past capacity
And Steve you had the balls to fucking mention me
You wanted raw beef now it's stuck between your teeth
And I ain't gonna front my niggaa your flow is ass
Ima throw you in a bag put you in the trash
Send you to piano class
I haven't heard any wack rappers in a while
Except for Lenny p, tf III ,and Stevie styles
Fucking chump niggas better back off
Y'all remind me of lil b you know from task force
My wordplay sharp like a blade or a battle axe
You pop me I pop back like a Snapple fact
You thought I won't react, your one fourth my fraction
And when it comes to hip hop your one fourth my passion, look
These fools wanna spit bars but I don't pay attention
My bars are like a prison yours is something like detention
You on the wrong turf if the mic is where your stepping
How you gonna make some rhymes with no comprehension
Of what real hip hop is
So stop the shit
Or ima have to block your bliss
And top your "hits"
Im on a different, level it's so true
I'm like 3 of you, plus 3 of you, and you times 2
I'm so crazy
Psycho is what y'all make me
Cus lately, your music be sounding like trash
And y'all don't know how to act
So I bounced back with a diss track
None of its simplistic
Lenny sounds  autistic
And  tf3 wanna be, another Drake MC
Following the paths of soft niggas
Will make you  soft yourself
Look at Stevie v that niggaa needs some help
On his flow, his lryics, his attitude
Got him dancing with the jungle in the baddest mood
King Kong tried to step up to the Godzilla
Ima killa with the mic
Make sure my shit sounds tight
