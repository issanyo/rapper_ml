[Verse 1: Paul Banks]
I don’t needs these highs to raise me
I don’t need these highs to lift me
I don’t want your smiles to wake me
I don’t think that I should slowly go
Never ending trials I am facing
I don’t want their wiles to mix me up
I’m all fucked up today
My lucky friend says your luck will end today
I don’t need these highs to raise me
I don’t need these lows to know
I don’t want these childs to be rating me
I don’t need their noses to nose my heart
That’s a start
Let’s get it on
My lucky friend says your luck will end today
My lucky friend says your luck will end today

[Verse 2: RZA]
Ice cold on the battlefield
Twenty below was the wind chill
Winchester rifle with the hot lead
That burnt a hole in their fuckin heads
Bullets rained on the battlefield
The survivor is the one who kills
Now they drown in their own blood
Men laying where they once stood
Through the fire and the gun smoke
Niggas crawlin with their backs broke
And they hoping that they don’t croak
Bullets sprayin and there’s no hope
One by one I slay my enemy
Drain them of their energy
I fight for this victory
You die in your iniquity
Ice cold on the battlefield
Twenty below, motherfucker, that’s the wind chill
A thousand men may come but they fall one by one
Call the preacher and the mortician you can’t stop this coalition
It’s like I’m fighting against the prohibition
In the sunlight, bong, you see that sword glisten

[Bridge: Paul Banks]
My lucky friend says your luck will end today
Now we got this taste for blood
Now we got this taste for blood oh no
This pain here is all but surmounted by peace
It truly is

[Verse 3: RZA]
Killer Hill Brownsville never ran never will
Beats worth a quarter mil
Movie cams on my grill
Never jam never squeal
Chrome on every wheel
A bag of cash in this stash
Clean on the bills
I’m just one of my mom’s eight born sons
One of those nine swordsmen slice your neck with a tongue
It’s the old dirty cousin a student of Allah justice
Force in my mind cause the atom bomb to crush this
I bathe in the moonlight gave praise in the sunlight
Seen the platoon strike at midnight to the noon light
Oh what a life
With just a butter knife they can hijack your crew and destruct
Interrupt your life
Then raise the price of grass, hash, gas, and rice
I send the white square bishop to
Sacrifice the knight

[Outro: Paul Banks]
One by one
One by one
One by one
One by one
One by one
