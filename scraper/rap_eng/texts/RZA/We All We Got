Bobby Bobby Bobby, Digi Digi Digi (we all that we got, we all that we got)

[RZA]
Aiyo, we keep these wizzes in the lab, held down like hostages
Dime pieces, deep throat like ostriches
I'm vegetarian, don't eat swine sausages
You defeat the Killa Beez? Don't be proposterous

[Crisis]
Bobby, steal the show, let 'em know who got the shit

[RZA]
Zu, muthafucka, Wu, (yeah), we got this shit

[girl]
Bobby Bobby Bobby, Digi Digi Digi

[RZA]
E-lectricity, e-lectricity
Yeah, shells all in my clip, wizzes all on my dick
Leather wood, on the whip, rubbergrips on four fifths
Escape from jakes, if I'm traced, more paper to make
My team form the C.R.E.A.M., we exchange it for cake
Cherries on the top, I grind for the gwop
I'm grot, then I shine, then I rise to the top
Roll, with flurries of cops, money bulging in my socks
Loving my block, cuz we all that we got, got
Bobby Bobby Bobby, Digi Digi Digi
Oh yeah, ya'll know who is he, ya'll keep these wizzes dizzy

[girl & Monk]
Bobby Bobby Bobby, Digi Digi Digi

[RZA]
E-lectricity, e-lectricity

[Chorus 2X: Crisis, Monk]
I love my hood and my block, cuz it's all that we got
On the grind for this gwop, give it all that we got
