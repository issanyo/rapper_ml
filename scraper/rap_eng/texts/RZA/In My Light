How do you walk through my wall of sleep
I see you in my head but you're right out of reach
And you are the backbone I grind with my teeth
Looking at life from just underneath a now

I see the sun looking down at me
I'm in my light
I can't read the signs

I've shrunk in size
I'm a weakling
I'm the weak link
I'd be your guide but I'm not seeing
I'm not seeing

You are the watcher of thought
You've gotta suffer till you kill the killer
[RZA ]  How can one drowning man save another?
Watching clouds covering the sky you cannot see unless you
Uncover the coverer
[RZA ] The world is there but can you see through it?
You are the watcher of thought
You've gotta suffer till you slay the slayer
[RZA] A focused mind is the key to it, focus you can see through it
Watching clouds covering the sky you cannot see till you
Uncover the coverer
[RZA] ??
You are the watcher of thought
