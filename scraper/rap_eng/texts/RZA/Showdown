TARIQ: Okay, Reverend. Thank you

TARIQ (NARRATION): Thank God the Reverend got me out. I only had a day ’til my meeting with the Wu, and I’m far from ready. So I decided to call him to get a few extra days to get my shit together

[*Tariq hangs up*]

TARIQ (NARRATION): That was definitely the last straw. Tru stole my record deal, got me busted… What the fuck? It was time to deal with Tru on his own level

[*gun cocks*]

TARIQ (NARRATION): So that night, I went to Tru’s house and waited. Until finally, he pulled up…

[*car driving up, parking; door opening & shutting; footsteps, car locking*]

TRU: Ayo, Tariq, what’s up, brother? What you doing here?

TARIQ: What am I doing here? You know what the fuck I’m doing here! You set me up, bitch!

TARIQ: Nah! Nah, Tru! You buggin’! The cops was at the hotel you told me to be at! Coincidence? I don’t know. Everybody seen my fuckin’ résumé. What’s going on with that? What’s up with using my fuckin’ beat to get that deal with the Wu? What’s— What the fuck is going on? I thought we was s’posed to be like brothers!

TRU: Ayo, fuck you. Why you always gotta get the breaks, huh? Record deals, fly drug sales. Boy, I taught you the game! I taught you how to rhyme! You ain’t nothing without me! But fuckin’ Tariq gotta show his ass all the time. Gotta outdo me. Nah. Not anymore, bitch! Tomorrow, I sign that record contract, and if you lucky, I just might let your punk ass rhyme a sentence on that motherfucker

TARIQ: You ain’t signing a fucking thing if me and this fucking .380 can help it!

TRU: Oh, you gon’ pull a gun out on me? You ain’t even know how to hold that bitch until I showed you. Oh, look. Now my neighbors looking!

TARIQ: What? Neighbors? Wh— Where?
