Cassius Clay swingin', I’m passin' and whippin' bitches
And gassin' till they deficient of oxygen mass livin'
In gas chamber conditions, All Caps like Madvillian
Givin' whiplash flippin' these switches, for mass killings
Submission, you in position and quittin', submit you hittin'
You flinchin', lyrical syphilis I'ma spit it like a sickness you givin'
LSD trippin' and we spittin' like dragons
Hittin' masses, fire breathin' castle attackin
Laughin' back, leavin' wack rappers all blue and black
Smackin' the faggots only actin' up bad for the rap
But, attack foes in black coats and mask woes
From the shadows, I’ll lasso the last blow
No fiasco, swingin' fast so Tabasco
Hittin' assholes like glass bowls on black oak
Komodo dragon attackin', I’m spittin' ashes
Passin' faster than massive havoc and crashin' traffic
Oxygen mask for the asthma attacks happened from
Intellectual gymnastic, acrobatics practice
I’m chokin' and graspin', fitness gram pacer passin'
I’ll ever-last the past that happened back in Central Ave
When we bust ass, puff ashes, flickin' blunt ashes
Smashin' glass Snapple bottles, throwin' glass till it smashes
Hazardous action, mall rat master-less factions
Spittin' facts, babble facts like the back of Snapple caps
