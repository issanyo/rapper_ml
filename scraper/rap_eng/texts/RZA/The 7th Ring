Gab Gotcha:

Welcome to the 7th Ring
Last of the Chambers
Castrater, hater
Mastering the saber
Waving paper
Blazing major
Violate the dispensary
I medicate phonetically
I fornicate poetically with energy
Gotcha, the pedigree
I sponsor the Weaponry
The monster, the leather gene menace with the chemistry
The God of War
Cracking them medusa heads up on the wall
Packing Thor
When the hammer drops you can stack them all
Pack em all
Something where you rest
Now we crack a thug
On the floor violate the best
Yeah you're catching yours
Straight track dropping raps
We attack them all
Paint cracks from the heat winter spring and fall
Summing numbers in December
While they slumber I dismember
Lowkey while I beef with the avengers
That's torrential, consequential
Monumental to the game, we're essential

Rza:

The chambers is everlasting, this is for the chambers, boy
I'm saying.. poisonous thoughts.. we coming to cure the sickness in the hiphop
Brothers coming out here with all that garbage.. He said she said
RnB watered down washed out versions of music
We bring y'all the dirty uncut

Old Dirty Bastard:

Where ever you come from, whereever you're at
If you're down with me, then let's roll
(you didn't know me!)

Gab Gotcha:

Chamber music, I shake melodical acoustics
At a rate that produces epilepsy to the users
I'm a bonafide seducer, pipelane drug abuser
Night playing in the cruiser, burning sour sipping souza
Jimmy Keys gimme what I need homie, gimme Gs
Many bleed when they try to speed homie many leave
Many flee
Casket made of cake when they bury me
Standing at the gates with a crate full of memories
One of the best am i not?
Respect, check the history
If not, fuck a hater
Cause how I feel ain't a mystery
If y'all hot, then I must be scorching
I'm lighting torches with methodic
Lightning verses without caution
Gasoline dreams, nightmares made of fire
Built to fuel my desire when I cook what's inspired
Please check the menu, the recipe is legendary
Iron Eagle flying in the sky, the rest is secondary

Old Dirty Bastard:

Well i wanna know whos in the motherfucking house
Is Queens in the house?
Basically, mad raw hiphop, mad raw slang

Rza:

?? taking y'all back to the battles know what im saying?

Old Dirty Bastard:

It was something y'all never experienced before
You know Enter the Wu-Tang Clan, right? right? right? right?
Yaaa yaaaaaa
It was something that you didn't expect..
But you wanted it and you needed it, cause it was just something
That you had to do
