[Intro]
First you get the money
Then you get the power
Respect
Hoes come last
Oh my God, Ronny!

[Chorus: Tyga & Iggy Azalea]
Ay, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Ay, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Ay, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
(Kash rules everything around me)

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea & Tyga]
Uh, open up the safe, bitches got a lot to say (raw)
Pussy in your face, that'll put you in your place (boom)
7 letters on the plate, fuck you when I brake (bitch)
I got cars, I got bags, I got real estate (cash rules)
Foreplay, I ain't come to play (huh)
I got big fish money, he gon' bite the bait (yeah)
Can you drop it down, make that ass talk to me?
Keep that energy, gone off the Hennessy
Ass, I need my bag quickly
Separate 6 degrees, bitches think they knowin' me
Sex Pistols, Sid Vicious, wet you when it's horny
Hit me on my cash app, check it in the morning
Cash, in this bitch shinin'
Dressed in designer, she could get grimey
And it's perfect timing, gin with the tonic
Bella Hadid, homie could get it

[Pre-Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Ass
Cash, cash
Ass, bags
Bag
Kash rules everything around me

[Chorus: Tyga & Iggy Azalea]
Ay, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it (ass, cash, cash)
Ay, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it (ass, bags)
Ay, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it (bag)
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Kash rules everything around me

[Verse 2: Tyga]
(Uhuh) Ass rules everything around me
Deep in that pussy, yeah I'm drowning
A shark in the water, how you found me?
Best get from 'round me (I'ma dog)
I go hunting like a bounty (woof)
(Cash rules) Ya, make my own rules
Tattoos on that ass, she do night school
Welcome to the players club, Ice Cube
Diamonds might make the news (uh)
Bitch that's photoshop like rappers with that autotune (cash, uh)
Uh, your cheques is not approved
RM 52, anoscope, water proof
Niggas talk a lot of boof, 'til they outside the booth
My niggas like golden state, inbound, pull up and shoot (swish)

[Pre-Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Cash
Cash, ass
Ass, bags
Bag
Kash rules everything around me

[Chorus: Tyga & Iggy Azalea]
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it (ass, cash, cash)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it (ass, bags)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it (bag)
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Kash rules everything around me

[Outro: Iggy Azalea]
Ass rules everything around me
Deep in that pussy, got him drowning (drownin', drownin')
Kash rules everything around me
A shark in the water, how you found me? (found me, found me, found me, found me, found me)
Cash rules (K.R.E.A.M get the money)
Cash rules (Dollar dollar bill y'all)
