Music is like fashion, I'd rather rock something classic
Than something trendy when everybody has it
That's why you haven't heard me on trap yet
Was never the type to follow the masses neglecting the rap heads
Wu Tang forever, wallabees by the dresser
Was a bit of a collector before my money was messed up
Last pair I copped were vintage, made in the 70's
Save them for special occasions like the wedding, these
Are my steeze: Never spend more than 40 on white sneaks
Or more than 25 on a white tee and it better be fly, sheesh
You know this, it's gonna get old quick
Might be hot for summer, next year I'll get mo' kicks
Never had any Jordans, could never afford 'em
They lasted longer than Jordan, if I could I'd get 4 of them
Either that or some more Timbs,  been cool since I was in school
Ving Rames compared them to pistols
Saying guns and butter, older schooling the younger
It's hard to accept wisdom from dude dating your mother
But you were born in the era, when Common use to love HER
And some of these cats are butter, they fade away in your supper
But these guns appreciate, kinda like real estate
They're more valuable cause they didn't fade but originate
Still touring with old stuff, filling them shows up
Cause the old stuff never gets old bruh
I'm thinking bout the poems in OT, heads still quote these
The thoughts rhyme no matter the language that's OG
And the wisdom is timeless, money sex and violence
That's crazy art in the bars and relevant content
From Adam to Solomon, from David to John and 'em
Truly gifted but godly men writing as God's pen
Who deserves the props then?
The models or the God they're modeling
Blazing the trail for us to follow in
