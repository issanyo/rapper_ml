[Intro]

[Verse 1: Lucas Asher]
Gypsies and P.O.P.S. merchants and cops
Lights on the docks of the rich moving blocks
Singing the night away, dreaming the night away
Cosa Nostra's, know that I'm made
I'm Caro's Moses, power's my trade
Singing the night away
Are legends born or just made?

Go to New York, New York
Where the lights light up the shore
Go to New York, New York
And take over the world

[Verse 2: RZA]
From the heart of medina shaolin be the brain
Trains run through the city like blood through the veins
Bronx bottles all those latin kings
Redbones from Queens talk that Wu-Tang Slang
We project money respect and power
Scream the world is ours off the freedom tower
Seven days a week my city never sleeps
And on new years eve we dance in the streets

Go to New York, New York
Where the lights light up the shore
Go to New York, New York
And take over the world

[Verse 3: Lucas Asher]
Came from the hicks, practiced his licks
Knows when he flows, no one else coming close
Singing the night away, scheming the night away
My State and island once I got paid
From Staten island, where I was made
Singing the night away
His sword a mic and a stage

Go to New York, New York
Where the lights light up the shore
Go to New York, New York
And take over the world
