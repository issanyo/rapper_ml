[Intro: John F. Kennedy]
The dramatic achievements in space which have occurred in recent weeks
Should have made clear to us all
As did Sputnik in 1957
The impact of this invention in the minds of men everywhere
Who are attempting to make a determination
Of which road they should take

[Verse 1: Paul Banks]
A captain inspires, that’s what they always say
I’m gonna make it someday
Reach for the skies, let the trees fall as they may
I’m gonna make it someday
I’m gonna make it someday
Freeform disguise, that’s how I kiss my prey
I know I’ll make it some day

[Verse 2: RZA]
Dangerous weapons, proceed at your own discretion
There’s no time for panic buttons or emergency exits
Purge, surge, burn like electric or antiseptic on you germs
There’s no chance for paramedics
This is ancient as the Vedic
Hari Krishna Vishnu
Move the black bishop
Over the world like a guided missile
We shall overcome over drums
No one knows but when the time come
Fa la so ti do killer bee amigo
Artillery c-note
Fresh brewskies from distillery
Cheery like a Cheerios cereal
Eery like a lake full of bodies from the burial
Delirium minds, striving material
Substance accustomed to weakness to the inferior
Trustin this poison that’s pushed through the stereo
Lustin for success, yes
Never getting blessed, no
Because they unwilling to fulfill the spiritual

[Bridge: Paul Banks]
It’s a jungle of lies, I know how to clear my way
I’m gonna make it some day

[Hook: Paul Banks]
Steep like leviathan, flow up like violence
A stone in ocean
A piece til you find you are known there
Very known
Very known
Seep like leviathan, chosen like tyrant
A stone in the ocean
At peace til you find you are known there
Very known
Very known

[Verse 3: RZA]
Trapped inside this schism of capitalism
Baptism, fascism, terrorism
Knowing that all these ism’s is just another prism
Another prison designed to smother vision
How can a child survive inside this world without his mother’s wisdom
For heaven’s sake I been trapped in a pit of snakes
Trying to speed ball through my life then I hit the brakes
Made a right at the light
Come to learn that the light expels the darkness
It’s like softness absorbs the hardness
Are you King, Kennedy
Malcolm X or Marcus
Nazi or Marxist
Narcissist or black caucus
He said listen kid I’ll be whatever it costed
And I’mma be that way until my funds are exhausted
He trusted on the cross, he was double crossed
Kissing on the Bible, then he took it tossed it
It’s like a bad habit dag nabbit, he lost it
The illusion of luxury man cannot afford it

[Bridge: Paul Banks]
Reach for the skies, it’s a free fall all the way
I’m gonna make it someday
I’m gonna make it someday
I’m gonna make it, I’m gonna make it
I’m gonna make it, I’m gonna make it

[Verse 4: RZA]
Adolescents on those antidepressants
No substance, no wisdom, they’re lackin their essence
Sex stressin, quickly undressin’
Now knowin that their future is ruled by their present
Don’t know their lessons
Don’t bear witness to God while life is evidence
They’d rather risk their lives for these old dead presidents
And live in strife in the concrete settlement
Never realizin that man means intelligence
History's irrelevant, knowledge is relevant
Righteousness benevolence, but don’t be malevolent
To those who try to teach you the truth, and bring you testaments
Become the civilized and rise to pure excellence

[Hook: Paul Banks]
Steep like leviathan flow up like violence
A stone in the ocean a piece til you find you are known there
Very known
Very known
I’m gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
I’m gonna make it someday
