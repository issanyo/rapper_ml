Yo let’s make this world well cool
Technological like the Jetsons’ tabernacle’s
We can combine Eastern and Western engineering and technicians
Hell everyone’s welcome
Aren’t we nearly feeling trite making this world slovenly
Wooden style colonial suburban blueprints aren’t boring yet?
I’ll tell you of a world that’s glorious google Venus project, a few hints for ya
And the inner city will be a euphoria
Committed to astringent inventions forwarding us
We’ll need a full auditorium and audience applauding our oratorio
If you’re honest you’re always gold
Along the open humdinger of a road
Where you’re left stranded sessile on your own
That’s why I stress these psalms/songs, leave you flying on your own
As I guide into the sun blind unto virgil diamond anyone, kick it and be gone
Chagrin rife it’s awful, die like a god
Synecdochical

Its' all love
