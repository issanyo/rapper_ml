[Verse 1: Musa]
On the track like locomotives
With loco motives of leaving the local and getting noticed
Whoa this – brown kid spitting venom potent as a king cobra
Like a king cobra my metaphors’ll wrap around your head
Lyrics leave you wrapped up in some plastic – Dexter
Double D extra while I’m up in the lab
Cause I’m a pro and I fessed’ up
Hope to God he bless us, forever and, the truth lies in reverend
Messed up how the truth lies and your two eyes can never see
So I sever sea’s like I never see life’s a bitch I’ll letter her be
Steadily killing competition with my composition like its death note
Blaze an L like a fucking Blaziken – this is for my Esso’s
Calling for a SO-S cause the rest sold their souls; I’m a rebel
I can’t be controlled with the substances I am a devil

[Hook: Musa]
Incarcerated stuck inside your prison
Frank Morris leaving these bars - I’m on a mission
My vision is reaching these stars – and exiting the matrix
Bout to go far - While I’m cruising on my spaceship

[Verse 2: Musa]
Incarcerated – It’s hard make it -
Involved in altercations with a drum and snare that is alternating
No longer here, I’m super sayan with some longer hair
Puffing on that og kush with that orange hair (here)
Lifted and my vision blurry – but my third eye sharp like an eagle
Blazing sour diesel hurry – the drones above are watching
And their plotting to put us up in coffins cause we coffin
On that hydroponic freeing are minds we are enlightened
The reign won’t stop man
Even when it’s brightened outside
Even when your frightened don’t hide
Yes I am defiant I fly - over mount Zion but I’m
THE KING OF BABYLON
Yeah I saddle on a unicorn - flying through a vortex
Exit out the cortex I’m corp vet with this shit
Empty the clip kill women and kids

[Hook x2: Musa]
Incarcerated stuck inside your prison
Frank Morris leaving these bars - I’m on a mission
My vision is reaching these stars – and exiting the matrix
Bout to go far - While I’m cruising on my spaceship
