[Verse 1: Paul Banks]
Never truly lost
Ever to be sought
You are
Hidden but from me
M-hm yeah, I’ll take you there
I’ll make the most of it
M-hm yeah, you can confess
Cause everyone has goals to live

[Bridge: Paul Banks]
There’s attics for habits and reading times
It opens the door to a goldmine awaiting
Never to return

[Verse 2: Paul Banks]
M-hm yeah
You can’t compare
Cause every day we’ll go for it
M-hm yeah
I’ll take the bet
I bet you’ll fold

[Bridge: Paul Banks]
There’s attics for habits and feeding times
It opens the door to a goldmine awaiting
Never to return

[Hook: Paul Banks]
See I never really knew you
I mean I never really tried to find a way near

[Verse 3: RZA]
I tear through leave you fearful
I’m in the clear view closer
I appear like images inside your rearview
Curling up like smoke drifting out
From the nostrils
Overcome colossal obstacles
Calm down the hostile rascals
It’s impossible
I make a million from minerals under my land
That’s formed from gas particles and fossils
Retreat to my fortress of solitude then I study my molecules
The physiology of man is biological
Although this seems radical, life is mathematical
Birth on this planet Earth in the universe is the most habitable
Pine trees on green hills
I seen queens I seen mills
I know the potential of a seed is some times concealed

[Verse 4: Paul Banks]
Just take a photograph
I gotta go

[Hook: Paul Banks]
See I never really knew you
I mean I never really tried to find a way near
M-hm yeah I’ll take you there
