"Who is, the man?" - sample

[Reverend William Burke]
Heavy metal blast devils, shovels bury devils
I travel through lower levels, killing demons and rebels
We peddles musical crack that settles in your veins
Embezzles your soul, and sizzles your beautiful brain
The Reverend Burke will maintain, even though he insane
And he'll spit flames and lick shots off like Jesse James
I feel the pain like I'm locked in a chain gang
And bang on the railroad frame so you can ride the train

[Chorus 2X: Reverend William Burke]
I sold all my money, gave away food when I was hungry
And prayed for enemies who didn't love me
But trust me, God appreciate it when you live humbly
Satan smile like it's funny, but buddy, Allah don't like ugly

[Reverend William Burke]
Bust back and clap, or get ya wig cracked, in fact
We all strapped with macs, but still scrap, cuz it's like that
So put the gat down, nah Jack, put yours on the ground first, reverse the attack
In combat, we don't back down, the Chi is that town
Where them girls hit the track and make stacks pound
Even cops get slapped 'round, get caught round
The wrong part of town, a wrong project building
It's elementary that eventually I'mma see the penetentiary
They picking off my family tree
We live an O.G., G's up, snitches down lifestyle
Gambino gangstas who keep a low profile
