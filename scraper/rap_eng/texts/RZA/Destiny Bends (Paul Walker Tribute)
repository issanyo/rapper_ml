[Intro: RZA]
Yea, I wanna dedicate this song to my friend Paul Walker
Up in the studio last night
Writing for myself
I decided to write a song for you
Peace brother

[Verse 1: Will Wells]
Every time I think about you all I see is your smile
And your bright blue eyes
Thanks for the time and the smiles
You shared with me
How you equally respected my art and talked to me
A young father just learning what it takes to be… a man
Sharing time with your daughter, you had a plan
To drive in the wind, surf on the seas
Realizing the love for a woman who becomes
A mother exists… and I see
How can this be? You were set free from your worries
Now you are gone in the breeze
Gone in the trees
I thought we had another day to smile and laugh
In the wind, how can it end?
I’m grateful to meet you, may we meet again
Paul, my friend

[Hook: Will Wells]
On that highway
Where heaven
Begins
I lost a friend…

[Bridge: Will Wells]
But destiny
Bends, bends
But destiny bends
Yea, it bends
I lost a friend
Friend…
On that highway to heaven

[Verse 2: Will Wells]
You will drive in the wind
And you’ll surf in the seas
Oh how can this be?
You were set free from your worries
Now you are gone in the breeze
Gone in the trees
Your soul is set free
I thought we had another day to smile and to laugh
In the wind, how can it end?
I’m thankful to meet you, may we meet again
Paul, my friend
Paul, my friend

[Hook]
