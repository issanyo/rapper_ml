Yo, break that dutch down

[Cappadonna]

You and your man, y'all fucked up for real
Now we got to show y'all niggas the deal
I sling raps, like cracks on the street
Attack, riot, rise above
Smash y'all, trash y'all, show y'all love
Thoughts are bright like a lightbulb
Ice cold raps, you stroll
Lease a finance, one chance, be my CD entity
Your energy is too low to bite my slug
You get drug behind bars and death is stoled on
Your code too simple, you best to hold on
Meet number three slang auxilary, and slang therapy
Based upon a true story, throw darts
Cut markers, straight duplicators, it's the terminator, Wu Killa Bee
Understanding, old special ed with the plate in my head
Bad bread, spare life, KKK on the mike, power like thing of state
What, play with the pussy and fuck
Stuck with the poles forever, what
Wu-Tang Forever, never sleep
Lyrics that kill, murder one voice
Chill or get dropped, your weak team ain't appropriate to no lessons
Adolescence, rhyme war, encore, surrender to my rap, I'm stuck on the map
Like I told you before winter war, in these days of hardcore
Smoke never stop clearing, stop cheering, you making me hot
Acid rain, a capell, wet you
And upset you, get you death threat, on cassette, it's the project
Reject, with the mic check
Set to be the son that set the place off
Face off, my darts is loving you, cyanide made your piss smell like flouride
Heavy stride, see it from the outside, archive five, smoke blunts hard

[Killa Bamz]

Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the silence and violence
We live for a blood on blood war
Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the blood on blood war
Uncut raw we live for

[Cappadonna]

All I need, is ten big bags of weed
Twenty-four acres of land so I could breathe
Money like Dusty, Prize like Leon, throw darts at you if the heat's ever on
Split you with the .45 caliber rap
Beat y'all down with shit that sound fat
Call 911, you still can't score
You and your dulla ain't prepared for the war
Yeah, you got heat but we got C4
Plus we got buildings that's watching your door
Hunchback, Chi-kids, Brother Jihad
VGL, FMF, the Bam Squad
Terrorize y'all from every direction
Call up Hot 97 for protection
Cappadonna, from the Wu-Tang Clan
Spotted last night in the all black van
Coming down the block with guns out the windows
Licking shots off every time a wind blow
My class come first, I'm first to represent
Killa Bees linger in the air like incense
Instant action, speed of a satellite, insight
Sight snakes from afar
Ajar, one side of a 2 faced bar
Project star, CD hackers
Supreme rapper, with the baseball cap
I attack fatal on the track

[Killa Bamz]

Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the silence and violence
That we live for a blood on blood war
Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the blood on blood war
Uncut raw we live for
Yeah
