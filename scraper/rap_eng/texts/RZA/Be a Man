{*sampled singer singing "Be a man"
And "bad situation man" throughout the song*}

[RZA]

Yeah it's Bobby Digital
Just floatin over the city
I came across this, this, this black man
He was talkin about (look down below)

Sure of yourself rising, prices of food skyrising
Foreign countries movin in USA, enterprising
Snatchin your mic then speakin, while you might be leaking
Then losin the luxury, average man be seeking

Thought he was so smart; ho's cheating, life fall apart
Fucking a hundred bitches couldn't mend a broken heart
Start as a soda jerk job, as a mail clerk
Fucked this white bitch in the office, got fired from work

Nine-to-five, government high taxes
Police dispatches, Beauracatics attackin black Asiatics
Resident with bad plumbing, Cocaine got my brain numb
And bitch complained about cumming, pussy stay humming;

$200 parking, summons out of state warrants
High blood pressure pills prescribed by Dr. Lawrence
Got me gaining weight, fuckin up my right kidney
Cousin raped at school, Eli Whitney

Peoples' eyes closed like envelopes by faux penmanship, with unpaid doctor bills
Framed got shot and killed, cops popping pills
Three pair cotton, steel closet, cabinet of no frills
Mo' bills, sister got evicted from Park Hill

Punch a hole inside the NARC wheels
My dogs bark, still carry dark steel
And unmarked bills, I'm from the uncut, dope, found on director's reels
Bobby Digital may switch back to Bobby Steels

Rusty .38's, bought rust inside the herb gate
So hungry, son, 'bout to shrink down to a bird's weight
Rash break out, where's the blue ointment, face-to-face appointments
Un-proudly in the church paid for annointment

Better checks don't come late
About to separate with her man
In the city, domestic violence escalates

Get a highest ratio in five years, the idea is to plant fear
Boy you slap yo' bitch, po-lice is there
To cuff you or snuff you, they might bust you
Cause your ho snatched your money up, didn't want to fuck you

We must learn to communicate, and unificate
Stop the black on black, hate on hate
White on white, black on white, put the love in love
I'm blunted up, blasted inside the strip club

Shorty wop, fifteen year old, all she needed was love
And mo' dough so she won't have to show her knotty afro
Collect call from my son denial, said he might blow trial, or cop out to 3 to 6
Bad situations, being a man is hard shit, something'll get trapped out I mean, yo

You got crack fiends in spots with vaccine shots
Black teens drop out of high school, white boys selling stock
With bonds they can't put their word on
20 years, shorty wop, pussy 'bout to swerve on

Up in the crib, new fridge, of dead pig
Two kids, from this older cat who looked like Calvin Coolidge
But got splat in his back last year, robbing this jew inside the diamond district
No one got convicted, heard they never found the biscuit

I'm booby trapped by the capitalists, trying to subsist
Sometimes happiness is hot grits and catfish, or a bowl of Cookie Crisp
I got harassed by this rookie bitch
Talkin' 'bout I couldn't put my feet on the fire hydrant to tie my kicks

$50 ticket, 'bout to strike and picket
And shout at the City Hall, motherfuck the wicked
And greedy, give to the needy
Down on my luck, about to grab a ouija board, that's when Bobby Digi seen me

Said, "Yo son, don't stress out over no one, learn the slogan:
Knowledge is half the battle, that's one to grow on
And don't be counterfeit
It's a bad situation just being a man, but we got to handle it"

Bad situation we in bein' a man
