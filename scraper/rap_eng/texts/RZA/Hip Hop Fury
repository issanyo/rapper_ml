[Chorus: RZA]
You crunchy chump crabs get crumbled up like crack rock
Fuck with the Wu, we busting ya whole snot box
Million white ears and your bitch up in a zip lock
From Spazzola to this purest form of hip-hop

[Verse 1: Hell Razah]
Here's something to advertise, promoter keep the fans satisfied
Load data for the disc drive, ghetto citywide
Leave 'em paralyzed, they stolen every word I provide
Without no clearance, I nurture this track like I'm its parents
Got requestments from retail stores for my appearance
First we target it, then they market it to kill your artist with
My hundred sharp cartridge hit whoever's starting shit
Got as many rap soldiers for how much this record ship
Fuck them niggas you record with, I make 'em forfeit
Send a bomb rap through FedEx inside your office
Son we build and deliver, came to build with the GZA
You heard the chorus from the RZA, ain't no real album spitter
Me and my street team be holding congress meetings
Audio visual video treatments internationally speaking
Got managers scared to shop you, ready to drop you
It's the coming of that newest hip-hop, Christ's apostle
Try your BDS and SoundScans for more fam
Your whole roster couldn't take on that one Sun of Man
Get your street team, get your stickers out, put your posters up
Boost your budget up, still Razah gon' fuck it up

[Chorus: RZA]
You crunchy chump crabs get crumbled up like crack rock
Fuck with the Wu, we busting ya whole snot box
Million white ears and your bitch up in a zip lock
From Spazzola to this purest form of hip-hop

[Verse 2: GZA]
Industrialized niggas change as soon as you get in
Throw 'em on an auction block, CEOs bidding
Highest price paid for those wack rhymes made
Was overrated, cut off, never reinstated
I be fruitful and multiply with marvelous tales
Feed the hungry MCs who be starving as hell
I laid the first verse to quench a dry ass nigga's thirst
Who drank my wisdom up like water till his stomach burst
Full tank with the premium quality raps
Mickey Mouse niggas get caught on a trap
You Cottonelle kid from Tottenville, you're Kleenex
Looking like Rockwell wearing V-necks
You learned from this, earned from this
Niggas get tossed and turned in this and burnt in this
Scorched at a thousand degrees from live MCs
I melt y'all niggas down to the size of fleas

[Verse 3: Timbo King]
Your microphonists collect the bonus, aiyo we own this
House niggas verse the homeless, ten to one
Timb's the one, Royal Famous. the verbal painters
Dark gallery, million dollar pictures
Imports from poor to riches, move darts
We cruise across the Brooklyn Bridge doing 60
Illegal driving from dusk to red dawn
The GZA/Genius, Wu-Tang, we live long

[Verse 4: Dreddy Kruger]
True indeed, I hug tracks like my seed
Masada, wack MCs do me nada
King Solomon the great came to evaporate the fake
Yeah you, you know you're Power-U
You recognize the voice, it's the nigga from the Wu
Every dart I spit gets mastered and promoted
You've just been demoted 'cause you're sweet and sugarcoated
You folded, your style is half stale half molded, molded,

[Chorus: RZA]
You crunchy chump crabs get crumbled up like crack rock
Fuck with the Wu, we busting ya whole snot box
Million white ears and your bitch up in a zip lock
From Spazzola to this purest form of hip-hop
