[Chorus: Banks]
I stay alone skipped a stone
From the known to the unknown
Feeding fires, spinning tires, getting even
And for a while
I made you smile
Saw the voodoo in you child
Girl you know you are the reason
It’s been a wild season
It’s been a wild season
It’s been a wild season
The hunting never stops (wild season)
Til everybody drops

[RZA]
I used to drink Ole English and speak broken English
To kiki this fiendish head genius
In love with my penis
Every evening she was slithering, seething
Until I zenith, yeah men are from Mars
And girls are from Venus
Life’s no game
I used to drink until my brain blinked
Insane for cane talking faster than a man think
I spent millions on friends who didn’t love me
The image in my mirror of life appeared ugly
Self-injuries froze me cold like a winter breeze
Bare as a winter tree, yeah I wasted centuries
Running wild then the birth of my child struck me
Realization I learned how to smile wow
What I know now I wish I knew then
I may have had a clue of what to do then
I may have gotten out of these bad situations
Running around town with no destination

[Pre-Chorus: Banks]
I stay alone skipped a stone
From the known to the unknown
Feeding fires, spinning tires, getting even
And for a while
I made you smile
Saw the voodoo in you child
Girl you know you are the reason
It’s been a wild season

[Banks and Welch]
Seems I made it this far
It’s been a wild season
Seems I made it this far
It’s been a wild season

[Welch]
You asked me how did I get home
Where’d you get those bruises from
Lost your shoes, can’t find your phone
You didn’t sleep here on your own
What did you do, where did you go
Truth is I don’t really know
Oh is this love its not enough, just one sip and I can’t stop
I'm too far out, too far to reach
From below you call to me
Don't get too close I’m flying high
I feel too beautiful to die
And on a tear, oh I don’t care
I see the horror in your stare
Watch me spin, oh watch me run
Watch me burn up in the sun
It’s been a wild season

[Chorus: Banks and Welch]
It’s been a wild season
I stay alone skipped a stone
From the known to the unknown
Feeding fires, spinning tires, getting even
And for a while
I made you smile
Saw the voodoo in you child
Girl you know you are the reason
It’s been a wild season

[Banks, Welch and RZA]
I know the reasons not to break your heart
It’s been a wild season
I know the reason still I stray too far
Made me realize
It’s been a wild season
Made me realize
It’s been a wild season
Seems I made it this far
It’s been a wild season
Yeah, still got the wolf in me
It’s been a wild season
2016
The hunting never stops
And we still on the prowl
Til everybody drops
