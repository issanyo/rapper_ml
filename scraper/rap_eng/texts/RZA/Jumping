I’m jumping like a frog
J-jumping like a frog
I’m jumping like a frog
J-jumping like a frog

Ribbit ribbit ya, ribbit yam, ribbit yea
I think that I might be feeling froggy today
Off
To the pond
To hop
On a log
Yea, the swamp
Is where we go to play “leap frog"
Catching bugs
With my tongue
Yea, I am what a tadpole becomes
To some
I think I am a joke
You either got a frog in your throat
Or your car got toad
Now
I just smile
Jumping all around
If I croak, it’s okay, that’s my sound
Feeling fine as a frog hair, my habitat
Got me jumping off a lily pad
My feet are webbed, my skin is moist
Got me j-j-jumping for joy

Ribbit

I’m jumping like a frog
J-jumping like a frog
I’m jumping like a frog
J-jumping like a frog
Jumping like a frog
Jumping like a frog
Jumping like a frog
Jumping like a frog
