[Intro: Timbo King]
The Legacy, get your minds ready, get your rhymes ready

[Timbo King]
Inhale a breath of life, resurrect the death of Christ
What you got to sacrifice, I'm on some other shit
Take over the mother ship, brothers get to claim the covenant
Universal loving it, olive oil you rubbing it
Check the thermometer, every kilometer
Rises by heat pressure, your thermostat couldn't measure
Royal Familia, atom bombs from Asquilia
Dark Ages, so read the pages, Mighty Malachi
Born on the cusp between love and lust
Genesis through Exodus, Lazarus, slash black Barnabus
The holy temple be the mental, You and I see Islamic
Can you understand the clear picture?

[Hook: Timbo King]
Braveheart, verbal courage, battle the seminar
Royal Fam Legacy, watch us travel far
Positive Energy Always Correct Errors
Royal Fam rule shit, now and forever, what

[Timbo King]
Oratorical, niggas is metaphorical
My editorial breaks down your monuments historical
Geologist studying land, using the Earth's crust
Measurements, eight elements, atomic weight plus
Density, hi-tech science, thrust through gravity
Revolve around my aura, I'm the soul that keeps spinning, what
Supernova, black quasar, my mental radar
Picks up frequencies way beyond the Earth's equator
Forever glow, electromagnetic force field
Thoughts build, we bomb for real, Royal Fam
Still exists, golden fist, you're caught up in the devil's mist
Fire, war, royal sire laws, reveal this
Protons Electrons Atoms Cause Explosions
The center of attraction, I'm the nucleus, you're frozen
My square be complete, architectural, visual
The sound spectrum strikes the mental then the physical
My parameter damns your diameter
Bar codes are scanned from America to Canada
What, from America to Canada (get your mind ready)

[Hook]
Braveheart, verbal courage, battle the seminar
Royal Fam Legacy, watch us travel far
Positive Energy Always Correct Errors
Royal Fam rule shit, now and forever, what

[Outro: Timbo King]
Get your minds ready, Get your minds ready, Royal Fam Legacy
What, get your minds ready, get your rhymes ready
