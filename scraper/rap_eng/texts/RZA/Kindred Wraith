1)	Frolicking in glee through the golden meadows
A Child with delight glows as he follows his shadow
Spine warmed by sunlight and eyes to the moon
Had only but one life, but shares it in two
With only but a projected creation of his own anatomy
A reflection of imagination but is part of him. Happily
In love with his shadow plays and dance with her
Would make a vivid light display for any oneiromancer
For endless dusks they would stride through the vibrant fields
Until his eyes lack lustre and would unto his eyelids yield
Lying on his mattress her clutch embracing him at the side
Whilst staring into the dancers of his flickering candlelight
Of his life he did desire more yet she was enough for him
For his silhouette fitted like a glove for him
As he grew ripe, years passing his soul desolate from famine
Long nights of harvesting left him desperate; and heart barren
So let his heart rest, strolled with his shadow in company
Through a dark forest where she treaded uncomfortably
Where he prevailed. Overhead canopies made her dissipate
And she failed, so instead became one with the shade and imitates
As he continued through valleys along the trodden trail
Dark clouds above rallied and the wind wailed and blew a gale
On the path, part of a cart had snapped an axel
Growing dark and hark by the tree bark sat a damsel
Face in handle locks blonde as candles donning a white mantle
Beauty unfathomable pale as a phantom this girl…

2)	…And now the magic unfurls, as her eyes possessed with tears
Looked upon him, distorted; wiped her eyes clear
She looked and saw his rough complexion and felt farmer’s hands
As she took his helping arm, she’d left her father’s lands
Rain drizzles. She must return to her manor estate
Wind whistles. This was urgent for it was a matter of state
Lighting overhead. She bears jewellery, an elegance about her;
But as they approach her resides, the thunder bellows (louder)
Keraunomania, as they look upon shadowed conifers
Blanketing the land like it twas all sewed gossamer
As they arrived, he glimpses blushing, admiring her face
Struggling for v-verbal essence to speak to his Kindred Wraith…

3)	…Upon the eve, returned to his homestead
The clouds leave, and he was no longer alone. Yet
The shadows embraced feelings of a different range of magnitude
She kept distance from him, the sun’s perpendicular altitude
Her angle to him is incomprehensible
Despite all her life acting as his sentinel
Now a plague upon his state but he could not playwright
Their contemporary intertwining was not staged right
As they lay that night, he turned away to his mantle side
The flickering was sickening, and he blew out the candlelight…

4)	…Disequilibrium established as the balance of love shifted
As the shadow is banished for another: this mistress
Both witness to his dismissal of his dark side
Leaves with purpose, self-service; surly a serpent in a past life
Sure in knowledge of what his dreams could amount to
In solace of this, he got on his steed, through the woods to the Granduke’s
Manor, where many were wearing many manners of ballroom attire
Mask wearing harlequins danced within. He asked a squire:
“Where in this masquerade escapade is the lord’s lass?”
Sure as he says this, a girl with eyes as pure glass
And with lips glossed like dew in the morning grass
Turned to him as he stared in an awed trance
At long last, and he asked for a dance
They prance as he offers the often frequent glance
But out of the crowd emerged a noble donning cashmere robes
Unbeknown that this was the man to whom she was betrothed
Rancour at the presence, wanting this hatred to go past
Who is this discrediting denizen who has swept her in his arms?
Disgusted at his lack of luck and injustice, with plan in sleeve
Sees him gloat, so with lump in throat, takes his coat and his leave
Every glance pierced his heart like a lance, but for her his heart melted
His ventricles were deceptible, but there was love and he felt it
There was no shadow of self-doubt about him
Springs is steps, but false winters of the discontent cloud him
To build the rafters to a relationship
He put quill to parchment manuscript
Drafting a letter, for the better, given to rider and Andalusian mare
To be taken to the woman so fair…

…The spilling of emotion drowned her in disapproval
They never spoke again, and he commissioned his own removal
Though not his fault, it was but his calling to do
And when he sees her now, it is just salt in the wounds
And as he travels home, and head rests upon his pillow
He feels a dark presence amalgamating in the shadows
He was a shell of himself since he dispelled what was real within him
Now in hindsight he realized that love was not feeding him
But starving him, so he needed a delicacy for his throat
So he walked back into the trees with a chair and a rope…

…Untouched by specters as he hung in his place
Walks back to the golden hectares, as his love becomes one with his Kindred Wraith…
