[Verse 1: Jonte Short]
I'll wait once, I can't wait twice
When you get back, better treat me right
I don't need cash, but since you asked
While you with me, where you should be

[Chorus: Jonte Short]
When you get out of jail, I'll be waiting
Honey, I swear, I'll be there
When you get out of jail, just remember
On that day we'll be together
When you get out of jail, I'll be waiting
Honey, I swear, I'll be there
When you get out of jail, just remember
On that day we'll be together

[Verse 2: Jonte Short]
You've done 18 months, got 18 more
That's so much time to wait for
So you're not well, in the county hotel
But while you're gone, I'll hold on

[Chorus: Jonte Short]
When you get out of jail, I'll be waiting
Honey, I swear, I'll be there
When you get out of jail, just remember
On that day we'll be together
When you get out of jail, I'll be waiting
Honey, I swear, I'll be there
When you get out of jail, just remember
On that day we'll be together

[Bridge: Jonte Short]
Yeah, baby, yeah
To make you believe, I've been missing you baby
Uh, and staying strong, everyday of the week, oh
Lately, yeah, I've been thinking about you
Uh, been way too long, and I'm losing sleep, oh

[Verse 3: Jonte Short]
Your cold nights will soon be warm
Cause I'm gon' keep ya, in my arms
Good loving, I've been keeping
When you get home, won't need no sleeping

[Chorus: Jonte Short]
When you get out of jail, I'll be waiting
Honey, I swear, I'll be there
When you get out of jail, just remember
On that day we'll be together
When you get out of jail, I'll be waiting
Honey, I swear, I'll be there
When you get out of jail, just remember
On that day we'll be together
When you get out of jail, I'll be waiting
Honey, I swear, I'll be there
When you get out of jail, just remember
On that day we'll be together
When you get out of jail, I'll be waiting
Honey, I swear, I'll be there
When you get out of jail, just remember
On that day we'll be together

[Verse 4: RZA]
Ayo, back on the street, packing my heat
Put my sweep, in a broken down jeep
Bout to creep, on you cats who gave me one to three
Slip back to my residence count my dead presidents
That I hid in the safebox, a hundred miles from the evidence
It's good to be home, pass the bone, boy the kid is back
Million dollar skate across town, ain't no slinging that
If I get knocked and locked up, for five more years
My money and my honey, will still be there, word
