[Intro: Understanding (RZA)]
Explosive mic Bobby trap rap books
The game isn't over, til the kings go wild
A brilliant virtuous doctor, in the 21st century (hahahahahahaha)
Experiments with a strange potion, called Digital Elixir (hahahahahahaha)
That transforms him, into a powerful being
That struggles with the great and evil within himself (hohohohohoho)
While saving the lives of others
Another classic tale of the dangers and benefits of drugs (huh... he's back!
Ahh!)

[RZA]
Yo, double dose of danger, it's the Gunfighter and the Stranger
Peep the silver bullets, like the old Lone Ranger
Transform on ya'll niggas, like the Werewolf from London
My cousin Dirty Dick Don, yeah he straight out the dungeon
Man up in the art gall', my girl, my newborn child
God chosen, son, we just sip from the Nile
Gold plated dinner dishes, fresh slice of fresh papaya
Pulled by the scrolls, read the Book of Obadiah
Smack ya head against the wall like a Spalding
My thugs, they carry more drugs than Walgreen's
Mr. Digital, bodododo, sometimes appear invisible
Got this money, now my old bitch is miserable
Old Jack Nicholson grin, I stay sinister
Two billion dollar advance, for a three letter signature
Holy frankincense and myrrh...
