[Verse 1: Jon Bowser]
I heard he spit crack now
You heard wrong, I been whippin' for a minute
Where you think the heat comes from
My noodles in the kitchen
Do I even have to mention, I get it in
To get a benz, to bend out
Pro tools turn Mac Book's to a Traphouse
Fiends want in, What you know about?
Goin' to sleep raw, waking up dope
My schedule's filled with gettin' to the notes
Out of town, weeks...and weekends
Yeah she chose, but I ain't keepin'
Let's be friends, naw
We ain't speaking
Why not?
Do you really need a reason
Eating good, living better
Ex chicks trip, guess Tyrone
Got his ish together
Yes, yes, they trip when I fall through
Clockin' paper the digits should alarm you
Custom cars, that ain't rented
Suicide doors give them haters mean spirit
No recess, miss me
I'm on a mission
Want that butter and I'm bread (bred) to get it

Hook: Jon Bowser
