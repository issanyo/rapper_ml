[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
It ain't nothing like a fistfull a cash or a bliss fulla the hash
That twist like a mustache, from end to end, spread it like a rash
From talking through your walkman or at your disco bash
Gimme the Timbs Rumplestiltskin brown
A metal face mask with a built in frown
A mic to tilt down, a hundred thousand pounds
And see how kilt sound like spilt milk clown

Cocoa butter on very ashy day fam
With Ray-Bans out on the islands of Cayman
Or i'll break it down for the layman
Bain de Soliel, for that St. Tropez tan
A can a ole gold too cold to hold, slow ya roll
Keep on moving like Soul II Soul, hold the dough
Like a fool who stole pity y'all
From tryna go up against city hall titty bar
The black mic is like a red violin
Ok, everybody back to the lab, try again
Bloody rap game like leviathan
Leave a bad taste, killin my high like niacin
Stop kiddin middlemen need Ritalin
Hit me with the full tin of gin and im a kid again
Keep the bong lightin straight through the song writin
The Supervillain AKA the thong bitin, thats inviting all
To the recitin thats dope and raw
Hoping all yall come in peace and its open bar
Tear the roof off this bumba rasclaat
By the end of the night spazz like shazbot
Spilt a shot made the pen lines runny
A ill plot thats ten times Ben Stien money.... funny
How he rips the scripts with a straight face
With more rhymes than is lines in ya database
Placing rappers in endangerment, who's reckless
With this food for thought sorta like breakfast
You could mark it off as wreck on the checklist
Wear gold fronts, can't afford no necklace
Shit, that there, could go to help them daycares
Somebody say yeahh.. (yeahhh!)
Pay ya fares,... give the Herbalizers his shares
And y'all could pay DOOM in beers; cheers!

[Verse 2: RZA]
I came to the shores of America disguised as a pillar
The alpha and omega and the home of the beggars, the black sellers
Who been beaten, raped, lynched, robbed and stoned
And caused to roam the earth in service cause they couldn't maintain at
Home
This dates back to 1555
When they captured the first tribe of men
And piled them in a pen
Fifty feet high
They took em all on a 9000 mile ride
And landed on the shore of a place they never seen before
But read about this inside the ancient books of war
Bonded in stainless steel, stripped of their language
Still survived the anguish of slavery but still remained nameless
Separated to portions and tricked by John Haughty Hawkins
And sold on the auction, taught birth control and abortion
Rulers of the first part became slaves of the worst part
The devils cursed God and reversed God
And turned God into dog and made people search hard
No relief came to the prophet of W.D. Feraud
To a trauma, dropped our mommas off in Bahamas and Barbados
Tobagos, separated us from slave boats
Made our own brothers hate us
From Virgin Isle to Jamaica
Trinidad, Honduras, Haiti, Grenada
Bermuda to Cayman, mental enslavement
You black gods become awaken
