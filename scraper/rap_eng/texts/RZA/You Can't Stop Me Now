Round up, round up, round up, round up
Round up, round up, round up, round up
Round up, round up, round up, round up
Round up, round up

No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now

The greatest B-Boy of all time, started from small crimes
While others had big tops I was slingin' small dimes
Tryin' to make the come up, the blow used to numb up
A few G's a week, my clique used to sum up

Till my brother got locked up, my girl got knocked up
My closest homies each, got popped up and shot up
And cops flood the block, no way to eat
So I dropped a half a G

On a rented SP-1200 Sampler and a Yamaha Four-Track
The bass from the lab used to blow the fuckin' door back
While Ghost was doin' stick-ups, tryin' to make a vic' up
Waitin' outside for the Brinks truck to pick up

Nothing would work, so we're back to choppin' nicks up
Givin' grown ass women two vials for a dick suck
When I was stressed I would head to the rest
Then the pads on the SP-12 got pressed

Makin' beats for the streets, so the family could eat
In '93, Wu-Tang Clan dropped their first LP
We went platinum, whoo-peesh, yeah, we flatten 'em
Pockets got fat and um, went and got Cap and 'em

Staten's on the map and um, Brooklyn Zu is bombin' 'em
All around the world, Killa Beez start swarmin' 'em
You can't stop us, you can't block us, rock us or mock us
Knock us or top us, better sit back and watch us

No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now

Can't stop me, man
No matter how hard, you better go hard
So hard, if you gon' try and stop me now
I be ruckus to rhythm like the blocks be wild
Bad enough I got the cops tryin' to lock me down

Can't nobody break my stride or shake my pride
Without a homicide, case and trial
It's a long time comin', long nines bustin'
Cradle to the grave I be on my grind hustlin'

Sometimes when I think about it, have my mind buggin'
The shit that I been through, things that I've seen
The chicks that I ran through, places that I've been
I'm a victim of the very song I sing

That's how it is in the heart of it, most want no part of it
Some will soothe the pain through booze and narcotics
I'ma hold my head, stay true to where my heart is
Either you pay with your life or you pay dues and homage

No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
