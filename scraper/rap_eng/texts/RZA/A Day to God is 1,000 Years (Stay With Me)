"I wanna stay with you, forever"

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo, the A-1 sauce, the Divine Force
My mind blind force is known to blow time off course
Even, if I rode around the world on a blind horse
Strapped down, I'd still get my point across
Allah is father of all
You debate whether big, whether small
Whether short, whether tall
Whether dense, whether length
Whether strength, whether width
Either man, animal, bird or fish
Whether, black or white, more shapes than snowflakes
Existin', everywhere but you still can't locate
The man of steel couldn't bend me
Time couldn't end me
Even the great devil Satan that tried to befriend me
Understand the equality, God in a bodily form
Lettin' my knowledge be born
Lettin' my knowledge be born

"I wanna stay with you, forever"

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, yo
I be the fatal flyin', I'm like NATO flyin'
Over your country and droppin' down forty tons of iron
Filled with explosives, your chance is hopeless
We have your head poppin' up like the blowfish
I'm not talkin' Hootie, nigga pass the zootie
I could bag the cootie, maybe smoke the ootie
The runaway train with no track
I got the heart of Faye Dunaway whippin' that child with the coatrack
T.V. droppin' bombs or droppin' germs
Baby moms in the courthouse, she's droppin' terms
Guns go off, bustin' all directions
D.J. choose, another fuckin' dope selection

"With you forever"
"Like the corners of my mind"
"I wanna stay with you, forever"

[Verse 3]
Yo, the pen is mightier than the sword, as I face my worldly challenge
In the scale of justice and my heart remains balanced and neutral
My respect for all men is mutual
As my thoughts surpass a level to which you devils compute to
You've been given the chance to hear the true and living
So do the knowledge, son, before you do the wisdom
So you can understand, how the thunder and
Lightning above your head is caused by the Son of Man
We experimentin' with high explosions
That cause the place to quake and the surface erosions
The earth produce lava like the mouth produce saliva
This wisdom goes deeper than your scuba diver
In search for the pearl jewels sold to Tiffany
My verbal heart symphony will strike the epiphany
Insight, ignite, and then men might, see love and hell
Hell and right, then excel, to be masters of your circumference
First, by obtainin' mastery of your common sense
This supreme wisdom clears a man's vision
You can see it through the lies and the phantasm
Of the equivocal, two-faced political individual
Who's only out for residual, fabricatin' lies
To eradicate the wise
But we come to civilize and gravitate to the skies
Of the heavenly celestial sphere
Trust me, son, it's dear, in between your ears

[Hook: RZA]
A day to God is a thousand years
Men walk around with a thousand fears
The true joy of love bring a thousand tears
In the world of desire, there's a thousand snares

"I wanna stay with you forever"
