[Hook: sample]
I come for darkness, and lightness will appear
And you got to disappear, through this chamber of fear

[Rev. William Burke]
Yo, aiyo, the 36 Chambers of vigorous training
Pinpoint aiming, arrigorous paining
Swordplay, villanous blood staining
Meditation, grace and mind elevation
To trigger the thought, the law of the court
Be the love of the sport, and it can't be bought
Once taught, the hidden Chi secret style art
To use it, to get to the top and not part
I sought, a means of escape from the darkness
And how much energy will victory cost us
12 Jewelz, and the Gods move cautious
Twelve fools, had attempted to flaw with us
But we pop shots at 'em, like jump shots
Three hundred and sixty degrees, cause we lunch box
With more kung fu chops than Ong Bak
One drop, of Wu blood'll make it hot to the last drop

[RZA]
I suppose you know, you can't oppose the chosen one
My cold mental chill will leave Phoenix with a frozen sun
Gravities being shot from a golden gun
No defending my lane, boy, no holding, son
Just submit, my crown is undefeatable
So bow down to the dragon, that's unbeatable
Programming my thoughts, that's undeletable
You'll imagine me achieving the inconcivable
Shake opponents, the God is unbreakable
Try to steal the moment, but you dogs are incapable
Trials and tribulations, and fouled the stipulation
My word articulation, will uplift the nation
You can bet, I'm a triple threat
Whether assisting, defending or swishing through the net
Dot world wide web, I'm a world wide celeb
Bobby got Bush like George and Jeb
King pioneer, travel with the Cavaliers
Step inside the square, if you dare wanna battle here

[Hook 2X]

[Rev. William Burke]
Preach prophet, drop God body logic
Whose squadron invincible, and devils can't stop it
We cosmic comets from the lands of the tropics
Who see through third eye optics, like cockpits

[RZA]
Against all odds, and against all squads
We defending the yard, with the strength of the God
And stand and deliver, face the man in the mirror
And abandon our fears, without a blam or a shiver
If I give my word, then I plan to deliver
Expand my whole Clan, over land and the rivers
You'll receive from the giver, understand and consider
Don't fall to the fear, you should stand as a pillar

[Hook 2X]
