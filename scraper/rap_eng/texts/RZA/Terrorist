BOBBY!! Bobby Bobby Bobby, word up Digital, Digital
Terrorist shit, terrorist shit, come and get a hold of it
Tune of the Black Knight, Killarm, Killarm, Killarm

[Verse 1: Dom Pachino (P.R. Terrorist)]
Contemplate on how to run this shit
Universally forever runnin
Reflect shots off my wall, (THIS SHIT) will split your nugget
Thoughts too rugged, extortinate cream from off the budget
Refugees of the Terrorist, fans, they fuckin love it
Insurance can't cover it, your maximum is a minimum
Niggas, they try to dub it, yo
It's the hottest shit on the streets since summer '86
My prefix, is like a remix, throwin bricks
Try and dub the shit it's accurate
Come for your head, it's Immaculate Conception
When my rep is, bustin shots
Niggas try to discuss my business around the neighborhood

[Verse 2: Doc Doom]
Yo, switch blade grenade rhyme flows, buck niggas like wild rhinos
Up in these killin fields you bound to die slow
Your style staggers like a drunken wino
That's why there's no hope to defeat a Black Knight
That's like tryin to walk a tight rope
Switch blade grenade rhyme flows, buck niggas like wild rhinos
Up in these killin field you bound to die slow
Your style staggers like a drunken wino
That's why there's no hope to defeat a Black Knight
That's like tryin to walk a tight rope, wit no feet
Mercenary team, streets of concrete
Sasquash dump a nigga ass on wide Friday
Invincible, Doctor Destructor
My lyrics ran war like Lebanon are troops, a Desert Storm
It be on son, Compton is the city where I come from
Act dumb if you want to and catch a hot one
It's that real, knuckle up, lace your boots tight
Don't give a fuck cuz every night is our night

[Verse 3: Killa Sin]
Rap bygones, smash spit fire outta cons
Fuck bygones, rely on Islam and my pythons
Squeeze off long diss, window pitch, control of this
Gun powder covers my wrist, blasphemous
Have these fake fucks cursin my name
Knowin damn well I'm hurting the same
What part of the game you playin, kid I'm sayin'
Yo three months ago we was on, but it's on now
Chasin the don, your money ain't long
Faggot fuck, bag em up, stick him in the back of my truck
Strip em and smack him up for actin up
He's slithering, hit him in the ribs again
Broke the code of honor that we livin in
Could lead to the whole click, dismemberin'
Never that, Killarm roll strong
Even though you gone, Wise, the crew will still hold on
I love you, in that dream, you probably told me who bust you
Should of payed attention but I slept so for that
I gotta dust two, devils off, headed off, all that
Fuck it, blow trial style, Law and Order cat gotta serve justice
What, fuck this, justice, get your musket, and bust quick word up

[Outro: Holocaust]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, thieves-[cut off]
