[Verse: David Stones]

I be the legend before the legacy
S to the fucking T
Luckily I mastered the art of living sucker free
Who stopping me?
Rain on your whole fucking monopoly
Breathe of fresh air breaking up all the monotony
Go 'head with all that pretend shit
We bear no resemblance
Horrendous
Just pray for you these bars are not intended
One line will whipe a rapper from attendance
My pen(n)'s dangerous
Nigga you could get sentenced
You ain't fooling me with your lies and tom-foolery
Acting like we cool tryna cover up the scrutiny
Smiling in my face cause you see a oppurtunity but if you had a chance you'll be the first to try to ruin me
Fuck that look at all these snake niggas laid back
Guess that they relaxed cause they thought they covered their tracks but naw son peep the ill shit I'm on your heels bitch
We read lips and body language 'til they reveal shit
Truthfully I ain't the one you got to deal with
I roll with a click that's on some murder murder kill shit
Banana clip spilling out the steel shit
All them niggas know is straight ignorance and real shit
I'm a boss so I keep my hands clean
But please believe I got some shooters on the team
With them fully loaded nickle plated pistols homie if you got a issue it'll whistle when it hit you blood'll trickle
My BK team so official
My brownsville niggas load the van and come and get you
If you chillin' with your mans he going with you cause I don't play no games
Not just even just a little
Not even just a giggle
I'm not playing go against the grain and niggas better start praying
Shots spraying
Man laying
Decaying broad day in BK
My 'rican mans cut with both hands like they DJ'n
Bitch I'm a get it poppin' like I'm supposed to
All I need is the beat the mic and the pro-tools
And my dude Sha to mix the vocals
Send the mp3 overseas now we global
The name Stones cause I'm known to drop a few jewels and on top of that put me anywhere I shine through
Oh, it's a acronym too
Simply The One Niggas Envy is who?
(Stones)
S.T. Bitch try to temp me
My nine work just fine I squeeze 'til it's empty
Dweebs gon' resent me for these rhymes of the century
I would smack 'em up but that'll be elementary
My presence strikes fear evidently
I'm all up in the motherfucking house like it's rent free
What the fuck you motherfuckers gon' do as the saga continues
DOHH Squad!
