[Chorus: KRS-One]
Suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
Suicide it's a suicide
Suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
Suicide it's a suicide

[Verse 1: Frukwan/Gatekeeper]
So you wanna die, commit suicide
Dial 1-800-Cyanide line
Far as life, yo, it ain't worth it
Put a rope around your neck and jerk it
The trick didn't work
Your life was fucked up from the first day of birth
After watching Jackie Gleason, walk into a precinct
Gun down the captain for no fucking reason
And get some LSD or a drink from the bar
Get behind your wheel and crash the car
Like Desert Storm, got bombs for the war
Confront an alligator, let it eat ya raw
Back to the function, riding the caboose to hell
BZZZZZT touched the third rail
You fucked up chicken, now you just got fried
Cause it's a suicide

[Chorus: KRS-One]
Suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
Suicide it's a suicide
Suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
Suicide it's a suicide

[Verse 2: Too Poetic/Grym Reaper]
Hey, you, little rich kid, what's your beef?
Come and tell the Grym Reaper all of your grief
You asked for a Benz and you only got a Jeep
Your pop's got ends, but yo, he's mad cheap
Maybe you're a bastard child, you think
Mom and Dad are white and you're dark as ink
Maybe you're Sicilian with a tan
But you hate lasagna and the pizza man
Now you stand on the Gravedigga plot and
You're singing the blues about the rough life you've got
(Not!) You don't wanna live no more
I guess you're really ready for the graveyard tour
When you get home, just seal up your windows and you doors
Turn your oven on high for about four hours
Light you a blunt, kiss your ass goodbye
You gassed yourself, 'cause it's a suicide

[Chorus: KRS-One]
Suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
Suicide it's a suicide
Suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
Suicide it's a suicide

[Interlude: Scott (the Moleman) Harding]
Yep, I've said it before and I'll say it again
Life moves pretty fast
If you don't stop and look around every once in a while
You could miss it

[Verse 3: RZA/RZArector]
Six fucking devils stepped up playing brave, God
Had the fucking nerve to try and enter my graveyard
I'm the Rzarector, be my sacrifice
Commit suicide and I'll bring you back to life
The first was convinced, stuck a water hose in his mouth
At full blast so his head can explode
Second one said, "Hmmmm, that's good but I can top it!"
Put a axe up to his head and then he chopped it
Blood shot out in every direction
The rest didn't know what to do, I made suggestions
Put a slug in your mug; overdose on a drug
Wet your hand, stick a knife in the plug
Or be like Richard Pryor, set your balls on fire
Better yet, go hang yourself with a barbed wire
Three and Four fell deep into the spell and
Ran to the zoo, locked themselves in the lion's den
Number Five said, "It ain't worth being alive!"
Smoked a dust joint, mixed it with cyanide
The only one who escaped was Number Six
He went home, sat in the tub, and slit his wrists
Yeah, more graves to dig, goodbye
There's no need to cry... 'cause we all die
