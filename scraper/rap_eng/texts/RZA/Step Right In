Artist: Dog Eat Dog f/ RZA
Album:  Play Games
Song:   Step Right In

Clap your hands
Stomp your feet

Dog Eat Dog said to step right in
Dog Eat Dog said to step right out
Dog Eat Dog said to step right in
Tell me son what the fuck is life about

Verse One:
We search this world for love, peace & harmony
But all we found was hate, deceit & jealousy
Dog Eat Dog so come and check the dialogue
Get your brain out of the fog
Vinny Barbarino represent the Sweathogs
All Boro Kings Roadrunner Catalog
You could run but you can't get far
No matter where you at, that's where you are

Chorus:
No matter where you from
Don't matter what you do
We got the bangin' beats and you can all get some
It's like a rabid dog infecting you (x2)

Verse Two:
Explosion I'm moving like motion
I'm gigantic like the atlantic ocean
Feel the force I strike with the iron cross
You're the face of the pale horse
True indeed we plant the seed to infiltrate the
Whole World Community
We're taking no slack it's an all out attack
Cuz this time the RZA let us hook the track
Word to god together on a mission so guard your
Tape deck we're converting stereos
Dog Eat Dog and the RZArecta tell you one more time boy
Protect your neck

Chorus

Dog Eat Dog said to step right in
Dog Eat Dog said to step right out
Dog Eat Dog said to step right in
Tell me son what the fuck is life about

Chorus
