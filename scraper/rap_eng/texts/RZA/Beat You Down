[Chorus: RZA]
I'mma beat you down, to the ground
I'mma beat you down, fool
I'mma beat you down, to the ground
I'mma beat you down, dude
I'mma put my foot on yo ass
I'mma break you down, fool
I'mma beat your face with this bat
I'mma beat you down, boy
I'll beat you down, to the ground
I'll beat you down, yo
I'll beat you down, to the ground
I'll beat you down, fool

[Reverend William Burke]
Yo, dark hallways, dead bodies, it's always
Rats and the O'Jays, songs from the old days
The Chi got a lotta bitter freeze and cold days
Hardly ever went to school, had a lot of snow days
Roll wraps on slow days, and it didn't take long
Before I figured out, these hoes pays
My uncle put me on, stuck, in his old ways
Leaving suckers shook, stuck, in them old graves
Ya'll know the repertoire, I got the peddle to the metal
Like a rebel, and I know just where the weapons are
Ghetto superstar, pushing a super car
A.M.G., C.L.K., C-Allah
Limousines, DVD's, TV's, bar
S.U.V.'s, O.G.'s who travel far
Black on black, double R, we hustle, pa
Stumble hard, bubble double on the boulevard

[Chorus]

[Young Dirty Bastard]
Freestyle king, top I'm going soar
I'm polishing off with a blood damn saw
Feed it to your tongue, you ain't hungry no more
Keep stabbing ya, until your jaw's ripped out
No mouth piece, nigga, your teeth is knocked out
I'mma keep swinging, I'mma keep swinging
I'mma keep dinging, I'mma keep stinging, ahhh
Jumping on the walls, spider never falls
Lighters in the air, writing on walls
I'mma beat you down, like you stole something from me
Cousing Sha might put something in your tummy!!!

[Chorus]
