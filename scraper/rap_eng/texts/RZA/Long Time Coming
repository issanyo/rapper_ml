[Hook: Danny Keyz]
It's been a long time coming..
Days, days are turning to nights now
They said... they said I'd be okay
But when I hear those church bells ringing
I begin to pray for today might be my dying day

[RZA]
The great mind, surpass space and time
Seven plains of energy, interlace combine
Five conscious stages, stand up courageous
Change your polarity, seek mental clarity
Ziplock off the chronic, kissed it, then I twist it
Build on today's mathematic ballistics
I walk with the utmost honorable respect
It's a quick locked secret, so Protect Ya Neck
This is full metal jacket, ain't about that gossip
Nope, you get your face all over the Bossip
Go out the closet, you slimey sausage
Six degrees of luxury, with no deposi
They said a ? beats a ?
A plane beats a tank
A gat beats a shank
Look, I just hit jackpot, a hundred mil to the bank

[Hook]

[RZA]
The continent splitter, the dominant figure
The mathematician who calculated God from nigga
The Zig Zag Zigga, who civilize the wigga
My vigorous attack on the track, slice a thousand giga
Bytes of information, in one line, how sometime
Use the sky for a blanket, then I bathe in sunshine
Nine concubines and nine wives, nine lives
Nine clans sit on my side, we carry nine knives
Eighteen strikes from Low Hand, ain't no man
Can withstand the blow, from the Wu-Tang Clan
I answer many questions of life, without asking
Breath in the stench of death, without gasping
Fasting and praying, while you laughing and playing
I am fast in my mind, to attachment what we came in
And go through the river of life, I stay floating
Live a hundred twenty degrees without quoting

[Hook]

[RZA]
I have no fascination with Satan, no relation to probation
I'm the sun sitting still, while you trapped in rotation
Every rebel's creation, every thought is innovation
One demonstration, we civilized a whole entire nation
Attract a generation, who's built with elimination
Of wickedness and sickness, we striving for the bliss
We rising up our fists, five stage of consciousness
Keeping our promises, master our circumference

[Hook]

[Outro: RZA]
Yeah, I'm back
Sometimes, you think you bout to lose it all
But it's actually, the point that you made it all
It seems like life is gonna pass me by
But now I'm reborn to a new chance, a new opportunity
A life has just begun...
And if we having a good time, but wasting your time
Seven plains of energy must interlace and combine
And all praises due to the Most High...
I'm here forever!
