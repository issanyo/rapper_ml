[Intro]
This Bob Billiard for the Entertainment News
In the news today yoth rapper Shyheim AKA the Rugged Child
Is rapidly climbing the charts and making a lot of noise
Shyheim seems to be one of those little boy rappers
Who are making a lot of money
Personally I don't think a little boy should get paid

[Verse 1]
Don't call me boy! (why?) Haven't you heard?
Boy ain't nothin' but a white man's word
As the old saying go- I could never forget. Boy plays a tarzan g-tuck quit
So call me Shy with the Ooh la la la
Kissin' young girls and i makes them hollar
Fortan can never be an orphan. New Yorkin' Wu-slang talkin'
So hump the mile as I walk the mile
The little rascal's bucked un-juvenile. I be the captain of dappin' of
Rappin'
How you scatchin' the cuts and the scratchin'
Not your average shorty 140 on the block
I got more props than your 1,000 cops
Stop! In the name of me. Like Denise Williams I gots to be free
To do what I want to do. Oh Shaboo
Here come the Little Rascals

[Chorus]
One little two little three little rascals
Four little five little six little rascals
Seven little eight nine little rascals
Ten rugged rascals in all

[Verse 2]
Gotta make a record to gain recognition, or competition
My posse is blitzin': I yell hooray! When they cross the barricade
Fuck the arcade- No games are being played
Sneaky little Shy from the streets of Staten
Somethin' shot me and my cousin cry Jason
Jason Jason- time for chasi' -girls
I'm on every case like Perry Mason
Step in they face and beg them for they number
Get the seven digits and now they like the roadrunner
Beep! Beep! Yo, things is gettin' deep. Takin' old does and coffee
There's no time to sleep. A tazmanian walkin' maniac
A young girl playing rap brainiac
So pump up the volume. For 10 balls you could have the whole album
Of the rugged- Child- Chi- Chi- Chi- Bow!!
Little Rascal Style!
