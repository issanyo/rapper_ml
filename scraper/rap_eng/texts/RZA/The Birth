[Intro: RZA, Daddy-O]
Yeah, you know what I mean?
Cause yo, this right here this is called Knowledge of Self
When you apply that to yourself, you know yourself
You know what I'm saying?
Yo; it's gonna get your third eye open
You can see things for what they are
And not what they appear to be
When the God gave me the knowledge
And pass this information to me, it's just-
Whatever, the God right there
Yo Peace, Born Knowledge, Peace God
Peace what up Bobby?
Yo, yo, don't even call me Bobby no more, man
What I call you?
My name is Prince Rakeem, you know what I'm saying?
What's Today's Mathematics?
I see Today's Mathematics is being wisdom
Let me explain like this to you God, how I see it

[Hook: female singer sample]
Ever since my Birth (don't worry!)
I've had no one to care (worried all I know... yeah!)

[Verse 1: RZA]
They say wisdom, is the wise words spoken
By a brother attemptin' to open
The graves, of these mentally dead slaves
Who've been lost on a cross, for decades
And centuries, lookin' for the liberty
But receive nothin', but misery
And hard times, and things of that nature
By the devil in a genocide caper
Little Boy Peep, has lost his sheep
But I found 'em, in a deep long sleep
Nine thousand miles away from home
Livin' the life of a modern-day Flintstone
We the people, supposed to be equal
But the men who wrote that, they was evil
Slave owners, who did not include us
They just used us, and abused us
First they trick you, then mentally kill you
And use technologies, to rebuild you
This whole plan was a perfect scam
See that's why they called it, the Six Million Dollar Man
Six is the limitation of the Devil
In the Million square miles of land that he settles
Put you in a three piece suit, give you loot
Chemicals in your head to make you look cute
They use you as a fool to deceive your own people
And fillin' my children head with pins and needles
But I'll take out the pins you inserted
And I'll avenge all my mothers that you murdered
And brutalized, by this modern form of slavery
To speak the truth it takes bravery
And no man could stop my flow
Because I know what I speak and I speak what I know

[Hook: RZA]
What, becomes of a broken family?
Dreams are crushed and there's no more family

[Hook 2X with RZA]

[Verse 2: RZA]
Yo, as a life can be slowed down 20 frames per second
Seen through Panavision
The inner light inside my mind's shines expands the prism
A man of wisdom, victorious and the glorious
Sight beyond sight we stand up as Divine Warriors
Who smite with the mighty right hand of God
Yield the holy sword, swings the holy rod
Then bathe in the pond of Nirvana, escape the realm of Karma
Allow the true grace of God to shine through my persona
And build the reconstructional terms that's constructive
As we destroy the negative germs that's destructive
Productively, sincerely, we uphold the righteous banner
With the gold touch of Midas, mold the righteous hammer
And anvil, to the sound of Man-drill
Ignite to the speed of light cause time to stand still
Rewrite the script of Egypt, who made the Holy Bible
Or Koran, how long ago, who made the Holy Title?
Of I Self Lord And Master, who control the vital
Parts of your heart, who wrote the wise recitals?
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah, Arm-Leg-Leg-Arm-Head
Still puzzled like the jigsaw

[Hook to fade]
