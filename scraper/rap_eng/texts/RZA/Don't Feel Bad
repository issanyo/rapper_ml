[Chorus: (RZA)]
Don't feel bad (I could never)
Don't feel bad
Don't feel bad (nigga nigga don't)
Don't feel bad (dickhead)

[Verse 1: Ryu]
If you got a [?] on one side of your mouth
'Cause you got a bad tooth
And no cash to pull it out
Don't feel bad
If the bank close your account
And you're sleeping on a piss stain
Fold --out couch
Don't feel bad
If you don't have the credit to buy it
Put it in your girl's name
And promise she can drive it
Verizon and Sprint still trippin'
I'm talkin'
'Cause I ain't paid the bill since Clinton was in office

[Chorus: (RZA)]
Don't feel bad (when life's on your shoulder)
Don't feel bad (as your days get colder)
Don't feel bad (everyday you get older)
Don't feel bad (nigga please)

[Verse 2: Tak]
It's hard enough to try to make another dollar stretch
I might as well [?]
And dig myself a ditch
And bury all my worries
With a penny and a tin cup
Starve till I'm skinny
And invests in a [?]
Damn, I'm a mascot
Crowned by the darkness
Someone stole my laptop
Ran out of my apartment
I had a new show one
On the very same day
Well if it ain't luck
All my friends seem to say is

[Chorus: (RZA)]
Don't feel bad (when life's on your shoulder)
Don't feel bad (as your days get colder)
Don't feel bad (everyday you get older)
Don't feel bad (nigga please)

[Verse 3: Ryu]
If your chain ain't platinum
But you got it for six bucks
It came with a cross
And a plastic pimp cup
Don't feel bad
Cause your rims don't spin
If they ever get jack
Well then the jokes on them
RZA put the track
And we cookin' up a classic
Took it to Staten
And said I'm lookin' for that [?]
Don't feel bad
And it's a rap
For you faggots
I got a liquor shop
For that Old Dirty Bastard

[Verse 4: Tak]
I travel in the wind
On the horse and a cab
Land in Berlin
And then lost all my bags
Thinking this is hell
Then they hit me with a [?]
Had to go to [?]
In rubber slippers and pajamas
Got to be bad time
And it's all upsurb
So just pour some jack mom
To calm my nerves
It's like I don't have a choice
Or second opinion
And all I here is a voice
A record skippin'

[Chorus: (RZA)]
Don't feel bad (when the wall tryna trap you)
Don't feel bad (and these niggas tryna zap you)
Don't feel bad (they put you all in a capsule)
Don't feel bad (nigga fuck yall)

[Verse 5: RZA]
I can never feel bad
I'm the [?]
I stole Christmas from the Grinch
Bugz Bunny money
You jack clubs MC[?]
You best of bungee
More close to Tony Dungee
How [?] in cold feet
The wavey old heat
Like forty fat bitches
Warped up in gold sheets
Like fabrics and quilts
[?]
This is your brain on drugs
This is slang on drugs
Bob Digi
It's Wu-Tang on drugs
B to the O to the BBY
DI to the GITAL
You're all born dummy
I'm California sunny
And these old [?] love me
Cause my dick [?]
My tongue spits surp
Makes these hummingbirds jump
Two guns on my side
Bust shots like wired up
No green eggs and ham
We don't eat spam
[?]
But I don't eat clams
Get shoes like Ebenezer
Run hoods like Black CÃ©sar
Cept' I've been around the world
More spots than [?]

[Chorus: (RZA)]
Don't feel bad (when life's on your shoulder)
Don't feel bad (as your days get colder)
Don't feel bad (everyday you get older)
Don't feel bad (nigga please)
