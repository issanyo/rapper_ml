[Bridge: Paul Banks]
What happened to us?
What's going on?
What happened to us?
Where did we go wrong?
Where did we go wrong?
Where did we go wrong?

[Chorus: Paul Banks]
I can’t hardly feel your love
It all just seems so real I could be dreaming through my gold eyes
The cypher is incomplete, I am done
If everything is real I could be speeding to a cold sun

[Verse 1: RZA]
Have you ever had this feeling
Once in your life
In which you like a girl so much you wish that she was your wife
But she’s not your girl, she’s barely a friend
Just someone you see every now and then
Although it seemed impossible my heart has been touched
By this girl who I desperately want in my clutch
As time goes on I got to know her
And the love that I had inside I had to show her
She had a man but we had brunches together
The waitress had a hunch that we wanted each other
And yo she was right by the end of the night
We satisfied each other’s appetite like...wow

[Bridge: Paul Banks]
I can’t hardly speak my love
You truly were unique I should have seen you to the good times

[Verse 2: RZA]
Caramel complexion, we had a strong connection
But somewhere we went the wrong direction
On long walks I would stop to listen to the sound of the city local street musicians
She lost interest cut me off mid sentence
The rain storm grew to a tempest
The light at the end of the tunnel was a train
The shock at the end of the rumble was a pain
We stumbled, but who could we blame
The oxycontin, weed, alcohol, or cocaine
We pushed our limits in the streets of Venice
Paris is for lovers we only stayed a minute

[Chorus: Paul Banks]
I can't hardly feel you love
Now every time we meet it will be beneath a cold sun
What happened to us?
What's going on?
What happened to us?
Where did we go wrong?
Where did we go wrong?
Where did we go wrong?

[Verse 3: RZA]
8 years later in the hotel lobby
I’m multi-platinum everybody lovin’ Bobby
And I saw her, still had some feelings for her
She looked lonely and lost I heard her man divorced her
I took her upstairs to my room and I tossed her (2x)
And all our past desires that rushed before us
But when I looked into her eyes, she lost the aura
Wow...

[Bridge: Paul Banks + RZA]
These are not the same, no
They're not the the same
They're not the same
Wow, can you imagine that wanting is better than having?
It's crazy, you know, it's not the same
They're not the same
Can't stop the rain

[Chorus: Paul Banks]
I can’t hardly feel your love
It truly was unique, I should have seen it through the first time
I can't feel you
I can't feel you no more
Why can't I feel you?
I can't feel you no more
