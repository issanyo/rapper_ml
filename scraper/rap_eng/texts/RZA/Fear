I was afraid as a child. I was afraid of everything. I was scared of water--I couldn't swim--I was scared of trucks on the turnpike, and mostly I was scared of ghosts. But at some point, I realized something. A ghost is something you create yourself--a man's mind makes it happen. If there were nobody on Earth, would a ghost still have a chance to spook somebody? No. You manifest ghosts through fear.
     The words of Marcus Garvey resonated with me. He said, "Fear is a state of nervousness only fit for children. Men should not fear. The only thing man should fear is God. To fear anything other than God is to offend God." I carry that to this day: Enlightened men do not fear.
