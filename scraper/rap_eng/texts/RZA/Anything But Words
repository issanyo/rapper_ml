I believe that someone can be brave on this green earth
But maybe I’m wrong, maybe I’m wrong
Game on

[RZA]
Turn dreams to reality
The king of principality
Shines upon me
The holy spirit shadows me
I write songs for fun not for salary
Used to collect guns now the truth is my cavalry
But I gotta closet full just in case the project pulls some wicked bullshit
My logistics is logical
Turn you back to molecules, minuscule follicles
Then convert your brain to subatomic particles
I breathe you in, I sneeze you out
You MC’s, you live in degrees of doubt
That’s why I swarm on your college dorm
Make knowledge born from the hood to the cottage farm
London to Russia
Eurasia to Prussia
The holy cities of it the east the young shieks discuss us
Christ means crusher
We come along to usher the righteous way of life
It’d be most wise for the civilized man to trust us
On Bora Bora, we discuss the Torah
Then we travel across these lands like old explorers

[Banks]
I believe that someone can be brave on this green earth
But maybe I’m wrong, aim for the sun
Out in the freezing rain, I will stay on the streets all day
Until my cup runneth over
We always fight blind the light of our lives
My patience is waning, the scales have capsized
I read news full of glory
And there's pyres of files alight feeding mazes
To the night sky

[RZA]
Sittin’ on a porch, torching a stogie in the moonlight
Rockin’ back and forth in my chair, contemplating life
Thinking where I went wrong, where I went right
Was it a fast? Or a long life
From my calculation, everyday sensational
Every sense were stimulated, pains occasional
All praise is due to the father, the author
The supreme architect, the one with no partner
We give man the wisdom to be a gardner, carpenter
Priest or warrior, king or you can be a scholar
Husband wife child mother brother sister or father
All these things the heart consists of
Keep the planet floating gigantic like atlantic ocean
7 ounces deflect, reject
All satanic notions
We so elusive

[Banks]
I believe that someone can be brave on this green earth
But maybe I’m wrong, aim for the sun
Out in the freezing rain, I will stay on the streets all day
Until my cup runneth over
Runneth over
Runneth over
Runneth over
Now I see there’s some way to be free as a sea bird
And maybe I’m gone, straight for the sun
Out in the freezing rain, I will stay on the streets all day
Cause my cup runneth over
