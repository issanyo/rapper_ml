[Verse 1: ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
Cash rules everything around me, cream!
It’s a theme, get the green, everything up in between
Hype the scene, haters tryna lean
Standin with the team, lookin hella mean
Rollin hella weed, whippin’ hella clean

I'm a young temple
Paper pusher, overlooker
Melodies gentle
Bangin’ out the double-woofer
Study ornamental, fundamentals
Lyric stencil, in my mental
Now all I do is push the pencil, & the tracks assemble

New experimental playin' on the instrumental
Lyrics too raw, pure degree, elemental
Mentally, lovin me, new to oriental
Sentimental, I resemble, yet it's detrimental
Tempered mental, tensile acts not coincidental
Godly intel, shining through the vivid repels
What would impel, you to think it's accidental?
Confidential, what we show is preferential
Influential, every bar is consequential
Continental, groupy growth is exponential
Deferential, understand they’re reverential

Supplemental; here to make the city monumental!
