[Solomon Childs]
Uhh, Yeah
In the words of Silk the Shocker nigga it ain't my fault, Nigga you at the fault
In the deserts they'll have your arms and legs apart
Like a summer salt, Mark Ronson be puttin together the team to shoot at the wolves
We bomb like the Tali, Catch you at the rally
Frontin like you tryna get back into your lessons
Big Staten Island from two seventy falls adolescence
Were all the work at, Niggas is Hummer stuntin
Like they ride'n wild bulls, Besides got elephants clutchin on eagles
Chase down people, I'm that new shit like Ed Hardy
Yesterday like a Visa, You do it to yourself
Nigga I get it in, The RZA ready to have me start shootin up things
Before these boys get to callin Oprah, Squash things
Bake'n short bread cookies for Gail and Katie Holmes and things
Blow like baking soda, Killa Beez back to take'n over

[Alex Greenwald, (RZA)]
I can't get the stink off, He's been hangin round for days
It comes like a comet, Suckered you but not your friends
One day I'll get to you, And teach you how to be a
Hooooooollly Cow, You do it to yourself, You do
And that's why it really hurts cause you do it to yourself
Just you, You and no one else, You do it to yourseeeeellllf
You do it to yourseeeeellllff
(You do it do it to yourslef)[4 times]

To get my sympathy, Hangin out the fifteenth floor
You changed the locks three times
That shit comes really through the door
On day I'll get to you, And teach you how to get to
Puuurrrreesstt Hell, You do it to yourself, You do
And that's why it really hurts cause you do it to yourself
Just you, You and no one else, You do it to yourseeeeellllf
You do it to yourseeeeellllff
(Do it to yourself, You do it to yourself)
(Do it do it do it, You do it to yourself)

[RZA]
Yo, Ayo, Hey yo
Lost in the sauce now you blow off course
Equilibrium's off and your eyes criss crossed
You whorshipin the force, Dark side of the force
Talkin everyday I'm hustle'n like Rick Ross
And you stuck up in the court with the jury and judge
Ten years in the cell with the fury of lust
And you blame it on the court, You blame it on the judge
You blame it on the money, The jewelry and drugs
You blame it on the thugs, And everyone else
But you gotta realize that you did it to yourself
You do it to yourself, You gotta realize that you did it to yourself

[Hook: Alex Greenwald]
You do it to yourself, You do
And that's why it really hurts cause you do it to yourself
Just you, You and no one else, You do it to yourseeeeellllf
You do it to yourseeeeellllff
