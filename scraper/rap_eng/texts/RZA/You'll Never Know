[Intro: RZA]
One-two, one-two
Mic check, one-two, one-two (You don't know, that I really love you)
Yo, yo, You'll Never Know
Check me out (You don't know, that I really love you)
Yo, yo, yo

[RZA]
I love you like how birds love rose petals, Killarmy love full metal
I love you like how the Park Hill cats love to pull metal
The heat will make ya head whistle loud like a full kettle
I come like the Meccan civilizin ya Roman Greco
Chicago Bull bandana, I keep police scanners from fishes
That try to splash me out like Daryl Hannah
And blow my spot, no, I'm not the polka-dot
I tote weight, sip Scotch, bust shots, smoke a lot
My cousin Billy, yeah dun is silly, used to joke a lot
Chased bitches, cut class, got high and stayed broke a lot
So when the rent was due, D would grab the identical
Twin gats and put a fuckin hole in your right ventricle
Not sober yet, don't pose a threat, yo I hold a Tec
Soda jet pack on my back blast like Boba Fett
While you bickerin, this flame is still flickerin
And the magnetic attraction to my wisdom keeps you listenin

[Interlude: Cilvaringz]
Yo, yo
Choco bang that shit!
Yeah, yeah (You don't know, that I really love you)
Killa Beez, European
Yo, yo, shut up!

[Cilvaringz]
Eh-yo, my sword so sharp I split the tweeters in ya Genelacs
European Killa Beez attack, chk-chk-chk
I never smoked blunts, tote weight, nor bust shots
But fuck with me I guarantee you'll get ya neck chopped
Be the haunting, dauntin, brothers won't fuck
With The Wu-Tang swordsman, slowly get dropped
When my Shaolin sword, swing at Nasty Immigrants with passports
To teach Man, Woman and Child, with the sword style
God, complete the presence
It only takes seconds to chop a nigga head on RZA records
But you a worthless effort, follow faster then leopards
I can't wait to return to the fuckin essence
Of hip-hop, yo, my shit chop constantly
It's over when my shit drops, son, honestly
I love the RZA and the whole Wu Academy
For givin me a chance to be what I wanna be (What?)
But you will never know how much... (I love the gods)

[RZA]
Do you think this cocked mic will jam or choke?
Come on my nigga.. Listen yo..
Do you think this black mic will cock back, jam or choke?
I should stick a long silver hook down your throat
And snatch out your vocals, bitch my eyes is black opal
Reflectin this 2.2 kilogram Mac that smoke you
Fire ignitin' Northern Lights stuffed tight in chocolate Philly
Lyrics pierce through the ear like the spear of Achilles
Iron body Bobby Digital suit, don't bother to shoot
Quicker than Clint when I draw the six shoo'
Mortal Kombat whether it's the blind or the mute
Cripple, or idiot, dun, the style's ridiculous
Rapid flow got you petro, my voice echo, echoes
Off the Wall Street money we stash like Gordon Gekko
Gecko, gecko, let go my Eggo or feel my Eagle
4,5,6 in my hand, I hold the c-lo
Whether knocking out pounds, ounces or straight kilos
You know how we roll, it's a Killa Bee show
And I love you like the pharoah loved Joseph, the Jews love Moses
Like a man bendin down on one knee before he proposes
Expressed in the faith of Abraham about to slay Isaac
And the patience of Daniel in the lion's den with closed eyelids
You'll never know, you'll never know...

(You don't know, that I really love you)
(You don't know that I'm really there)
