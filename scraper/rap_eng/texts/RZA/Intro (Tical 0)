[RZA]
Tical: The Prequel
What up, yo, this is the RZA
AKA Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah
I wanna welcome ya'll to the Tical: The Prequel
Starring Wu-Tang Brother #1, the M-E-T-H-O-D Man
AKA Johnny Blaze, AKA Hot Nix, the Iron Lung
Big John Studd, Johnny Storm, check it out, yo
My brother Meth bout to take ya'll on some new
And unexplored chambers of the Wu-Tang universe
So I want all my nizzes, and all my wizzes
To get a big bag of rizzes and greeneries and blizzes
And sit back and Johnny Blaze take you on a ride to the other side
Peace to the Wu-Tang family, ten years strong
Forty million albums sold, platinum and gold
And the sage continues...
Yo, pass that blunt homey, let's fuck these niggas up real quick

[Method Man]
Aight... let's do it...
