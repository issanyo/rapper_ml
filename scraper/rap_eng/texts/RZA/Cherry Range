[Intro: RZA]
Yeah, yo, what up yo?
Yeah, yeah, what up?
Nothin', man, hold on
Someone beepin' on my other line and shit
Nigga, I've seen everything I wanted to see
Come on son, yo, in my Range Rover runnin' out this muthafucka and shit
I be there in ninety minutes, aight, I make a stop
Aight, peace, one-one

[RZA]
I'm up in the Cherry Range, drivin' fast through heavy rains
My mind's on everything, my Wiz, my seed, the five pounds of weed
My dog got bagged with tryin' to sling in D.C
My cell phone rings off the hook: "brrring!"
"Kinetic 9: Yo, what's the word, king?"

[Beretta 9]
Duckin' lights, b.s. and problems, pushin' through Holland Tunnel
Tryin' to avoid getting caught up in the funnel
'Cuz in the jungle, sometimes you gotta rumble
With the, the Beez...

[RZA]
... That's why we study degrees
And keep our third eye open for c-cypher punks
Will bag you for a blunt and lock you up for a month
You've seen Bird? You had beef with that chump
And I heard he came home from a two-year slump

[Beretta 9]
Yeah, I heard, I got the pump in the trunk
And when I see that crab, I'm a dump in his lump
'Cuz niggas ain't shit but welfare cheese

[RZA]
With their food stamp bitches and their coupon seeds

[Beretta 9]
Frontin' with their platinum like they're O's and G's

[RZA]
When faced with the gat, niggas pose and freeze
And melt like snow on my windshield, that windmills
In my mind spin, they give skin chills
Yo, son, we gotta make them deals
For ten mill's so we can pay them bills, yo

[Hook: RZA & Beretta 9]
You wanna eat how we wanna eat, live how we wanna live
Be what we wanna be, give what we wanna give
Say what we wanna say, play how we wanna play
Teach what we wanna teach, do what we gotta do
Eat how we wanna eat, live how we wanna live
Be what we wanna be, give what we wanna give
Say what we wanna say, play what we wanna play
Teach what we gotta teach, lay where we wanna lay
Do what we gotta do, eat how we wanna eat
Live how we gotta live, be what we wanna be
Give what we gotta give, say what we wanna say
Play anywhere we play, teach where we gotta reach
Do what we gotta do, lay where we wanna lay
Stay where we wanna stay, pay who we wanna pay
And get our record played, on the radio
Airwaves, without havin' to pay the fuckin' D.J.!

[Hook 2X: Xavier Naidoo]
Say what you wanna say, do what you wanna do
Eat how you wanna eat, be what you wanna be
Live how you wanna live, give what you wanna give
Play where you wanna play, stay where you wanna stay
