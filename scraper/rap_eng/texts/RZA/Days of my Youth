Verse 1:  Napoleon Da Legend
Nothing like the smell of mom’s cooking
Something hot on the stove
Snot nose I was a trouble maker god knows never judge a
Book by its cover an album either Malcom
Was a leader as a young man
He was a thief in the land of savages
We never turn the other cheek
Underneath a tree we look for shade
And feel the summer breeze
Scheming on a come-up teachers
At school they never loved us
All too often our grades reflected our skin color
A coincidence maybe called us lethargic and lazy
My Italian shorty used to steal garments from Macy’s
Then lace me with the latest Hilfigers and Nautica
I used to try to moonwalk with
Some Michael Jackson moccasins
Scuffles and brawls playing pick-up ball
Dodging the stick up kids at the mall used to pick up broads
With corny lines young horny minds
We used to trade porn and climb
Fences and arouse our 5 senses all the time

Chorus: Napoleon Da Legend x 2
Can’t get back the days of my youth so I just think back
To days where the world would be so simple
Where we lived at
We was large day dreaming wishing on stars
Play ball kick bars and get broads

Verse 2: Napoleon Da Legend
Huh petty rivalries we used to play 21 and 33
I was a fan of Hardaway 23 and number 3
Not Penny but the UTEP two step
Those were the days before my pops
And momma dukes split
Chest burning tasting liquor for the first time
An anime fanatic a cool kid with a nerd’s mind
My first tip jam with one hand felt like the man
Mimicked moves from above the rim and NBA Jams
Listened to WU, Onyx and Pac, Biggie and Nas
De La and Tribe rap albums in the 90s were live
B-sides were the jewels house parties were the move
Hunting for shorties to pull
The chicks were wack at my school
99 cent singles from Sam Goody me and my man Doogie
Rocking Starter jackets Champion hoodies
Down in White Oak
Use to analyze the mind of white folks
Playing a thin line walking a tight rope

Chorus: Napoleon Da Legend x 1
Verse 3: Napoleon Da Legend
Nodding off fighting not to fall
Asleep while the teacher speak
Wrote a note to my crush and she rejected me
I was on blast she spread the word through the school
A humiliating lesson had to learn how to move
I wasn’t smooth then rather naïve and green
Hoop dreams my fundamentals were clean
Would cop the new released Air Forces
Would mix and match all colors Karl Kani
And Cross Colors Akademics and Enyce
Academics came easy but it wasn’t me
Only place I felt at home was rhyming over beats
Hit the movies for some inspiration with one
Ticket we would go see 3 call some chicks and go to DC
Hit up Adam’s Morgan on a Friday night
Under aged but still found a way to slide inside
Grab a chick’s number on a napkin
Couldn’t afford to drink but made due with what
We had it’s nothing for a king
