[MC Cannon]

MC Cannon, the vocal focal point
NWO takin' over, locally got the R-A-P G-A-M-E in a chokehold
Frontin' niggas get rolled over like asphalt under a steam roller
Head full of steam, gotta hit up Obie and roll a joint
Razorblade gloves, 20 clip extensions and brass knuckles
Leave em' hanging, in middle school we was always gettin' suspended
We independent, tried but never a defendant
Fuck with us, put a red dot on your head like Hindu
On a mission for my family be rich living, can't be hindered
Rhymes solid like tree trunks, never splinter
Enter the mind of a dropout like AT&T, self educated
Past getting contemplated, is freedom hated our celebrated?
Won't stop till our thoughts Grammy nominated, cannabis blazin'
The block is hot, John Blazin'
NWO, niggas winning over ignorance
The definition of ghetto intelligence, finna grind our way too absolute relevance

[Exhibit A]

Cannon done, time to exhibit Exhibit A
Servin' to countless feigns, been pulling strings behind the scenes
Tryna kick some shit to 'em, Bruce Lee
Brass knuckles in my pocket with the problem solver like Vinnie P
The deity of the Serengeti, is you ready?
For the New World Order, blood showers on the block like confetti
Conspiracy theories all over, they never backstab the Yeti
My ancestors died in Sierra Leone, I'mma die alone

[Young Obie]

Big thang in the trunk weighing it down, don't need a scale for weighing it in
No white flags like NASCAR, your shit straight to the bargain bin
We is laded with accalim like Osama Bin, you don't know where I've been
You'll never be a thug, so don't pretend to be one
Only time you'll blow up is when I lace your mansion with C4
Nas took rap to a new plateau, we taking it higher
Totes of smoke takin' us higher, your only adding fuel to the fire
Get you ass back to science class, planting hypotheses on me
Dissecting beats and bodies, give you surgery for free, no fee
Dreams on anesthesia, they gon' be focused on death, life, and me
Close the C-A-S-K-E-T, DNA mixed in the M-U-D
In this game, we remain dominant like an A-L-L-E-L-E
This is hood royalty, no need to bow down to me
Sick of the sucka motherfuckers tryna keep them eyes on me, my team sworn
To secrecy, eyes looking forward for our longevity
Spit verses with brevity, only the finest surrounding me

[RBD]

If you even have the thought of messin' with the RBD, you must be tripin' on LSD
Lemme make this shit clear, LCD
I've risen outta prison, no more cell block riots
Brass knuckles under, pay respects to the hood messiah
No Just Blaze beats, but y'all never put out my fire
!0 years in the pen, a sucker for blood and gunfire, fucka' I'mma vampire
Have one of my homies throw yo ass off the Empire if you wanna shut down my empire
SafeGuard safeguardin' my chest, don't fuck withe best, more padding than an umpire

[The Five Percenters]

Brass knuckles and the Glock say two words, fuck you!
Never a gangsta, but threaten me and I'll buck you
We a bunch of producers, but we produce mayhem
From the heart poetry, who wanna get slammed?
Damn, I avoided Uncle Sam
Opportunity open, the door is ajar
Picky bout the sticky icky, pound of dro in the jar
Can't turn back, we made it this far

[Poor Ricky]
