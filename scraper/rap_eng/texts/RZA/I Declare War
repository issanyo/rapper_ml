[Intro: Sample]
"He's just one man—don't make him sound like a god damn army"

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, it's Tone Starks, the don, the face of a killer
The voice of the past and presence, I speak thrillers
Rock the purple robe, crush them with 24 karat gold
The chain is chunky like the neck of a monkey
Glass slipper, my wallows is made from lion skin
King of the jungle, ain't shit about me humble
Rock a black panther hoodie, nigga, made from panther skin
I'm black on the outside and black within
The hood superhero, the motherfucking Don Dada
The Don Wilson, nigga, I do what I gotta
I'm a boss, them DeLucas trying to front on my skin tone
I left the fam to start a fam of my own
A black Italiano, big pinky rings from Sicily
I move like the don of the fam, it’s officially
War time, Starky on some black avengers
Shadowboxing with killers that move like ninjas

[Hook: Ghostface Killah]
I declare war, war on the DeLucas
Bulletproof jet planes, nigga, you can't shoot us
Can't stop my reign or terrorize the power
Tone Starks, new king of this crown, y'all better cower
War, war on the DeLucas
Bulletproof jet planes, nigga, you can't shoot us
Can't stop my reign or terrorize the power
Tone Starks, new king of this crown, y'all better cower

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
I'm prepared to go to war for the battle of supremacy
There's nothing now to remedy this decision
The only thing left is the loyalty of the family
‘Cause once we establish the power they gon' turn sour
And use everything in their power to shut us down
We've come to far to turn around, Tone
Got a new connect, Don Stone
Flew his private jet from Rome to talk business
He heard about your crime saga poems looking to invest millions
It's up to you Tone, this move can make us both rich
The crew is armed, cocked, and ready to rock steady
It's non-stop hustling, flow of their own casino, RZA Tarantino
It's Wu Gambino for life, you know how we go
And to the last breath blow, mi amigo

[Hook: Ghostface Killah]
I declare war, war on the DeLucas
Bulletproof jet planes, nigga, you can't shoot us
Can't stop my reign or terrorize the power
Tone Starks, new king of this crown, y'all better cower
War, war on the DeLucas
Bulletproof jet planes, nigga, you can't shoot us
Can't stop my reign or terrorize the power
Tone Starks, new king of this crown, y'all better cower

[Outro: RZA]
Born into a world where violence, death and destruction surrounded him at every turn. Tony Starks took control of his own destiny and aspired to become one of the foremost leaders of the criminal underworld. Regardless of his will, and the ability to run the streets with invincibility, there were still those who chose to stand in his way
