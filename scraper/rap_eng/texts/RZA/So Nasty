[Verse 1]
In the place to be
It's the K-I-N-E-
T-I-C
Here to represent the
M-I-C
The shards will slip me
Ain't no D-I-P
And a bitch to convince me
The D-I-C
And the K will eventually
M-A-C
And a P for potentially
I-M-P
She said "I can't stay"
And it doesn't make sense to me

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know, I'll show you how
It can take all night, it can take a while
If we do this right, we can do it now
And I'll be good to you
She said "yo okay and I like your style
But I like the way that you make me smile
And I'm yours tonight if alright with you
Before I see you through"

[Chorus]
So nasty
I feel, got me feeling so nasty
Get nasty
Feeling so nasty
She nasty
I feel, oh God, I’m feeling so nasty
So nasty

[Verse 2]
Feeling like a million bucks
Plus interest
Pussy make power you
But can’t tempt this
Maybe for a hour or two
I might hop in the shower with you
Say, yo, skip the romancin’
Don’t shed yo tears dancin’
Said I’m gone for the wait
To guess how I’m panting
I got these groupies black
They save room for a Scooby-Snack
Fuck this up and
She’s a freakin
A down ass bitch
Who’s down for eatin’
First dude know those hoes be sweetin’

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know, I'll show you how
It can take all night, it can take a while
If we do this right, we can do it now
Say I'll be good to you
(We’re nasty)

[Chorus]
So nasty
I feel, got me feeling so nasty
Get nasty
Feeling so nasty
She nasty
I feel, oh God, I’m feeling so nasty
So nasty

[Verse 3]
Yo check this hoodie
Better pop that coochie
I ain’t borrow no car
I ain’t borrow no Gucci
I ain’t payin’ for dinner
Mother fuck that sushi
Could ya be tryna [?]
God placed you on the sides of city
Man, I love those girls with the size C titties
Just to care for
Just to cuff
Make me drove your deep like a sub-
-marine

[Bridge]
All between
Your jeans
You’re the oreo
And I got the C.R.E.A.M
Oh don’t make a scene
I’ll print your face
Toward a magazine
Round and round
Like a helicopter
I’ll make you something
All hella proper
You be calling me
Dad and poppa
Let me snap these balls
Like a big bacca

[Chorus]
So nasty
I feel, got me feeling so nasty
Get nasty
Feeling so nasty
She nasty
I feel, oh God, I’m feeling so nasty
So nasty

[Outro]
Yo check this hoodie
Better pop that coochie (So nasty)
I ain’t borrow no car
I ain’t borrow no Gucci (So nasty)
I ain’t payin’ for dinner
Mother fuck that sushi (So nasty)
Could ya be tryna [?] (So nasty)
God placed you on the sides of city (So nasty)
Man, I love those girls with the size C titties (So nasty)
Just to care for
Just to cuff (So nasty)
Make me drove your deep like a sub-
-marine
All between
Your jeans
You’re the oreo
And I got the C.R.E.A.M
C’mon don’t make a scene
I’ll pitch your face
Toward a magazine
