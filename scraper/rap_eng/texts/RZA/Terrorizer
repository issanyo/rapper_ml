Ayo I'm quiet calm, write my greatest shit when the light gone
My hand fast like Ramadan with a knife drawn
I'm the physical of Tsunami, you a slight storm
This is a spiritual anomaly, a fight song

To guard you now directly in my right palm
Nothin' new about it, keep the ratchet with me lifelong
I come through polar caps melt, ice gone
My mother cryin' to my brother why is his life wrong?
Concrete gospel - Allahu Akbar!

Crooked D's in front of the crib inside a parked car
Gumar-Oz-Dubar inside the shot bar
Darts fly at you and severe you like it's a sharp star
If we ain't livin' in hell I'm tellin' you it's hot Ba
Masonic manifestation of God is not far
In reality the sun is just a hot star
The Earth is just a ball of shit is where I stop Ba
