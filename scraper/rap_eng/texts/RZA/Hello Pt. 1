Damn...
How the fuck did I get here
Last year I was a nobody
I mean
Nobody
That managed me, couldn't even last one year
But now them niggas see my last drop
They mad that I dropped back
Like a Brett Favre right after the sack
Yeah
Hmm
Now I'm in this bitch like a pap smear
Hmm
Now I'm in this game like that name of the EA nigga with that fat chin and gray hair
Is Nia Long here?
I got a long dick
That get up quick
Like Supreme Cutlass
Somebody tell her I said that
And you don't need a motherfuckin' class to
Understand where my head's at
I'm
Sick as a baby with insufficient Similac
If Michael Jackson sent a verse and I ain't like it
Send it back
I take my shit
Serious as Bruce Bruce
Taking a constipated dump
In the bitch that Biggie mentioned's lap
If you caught that line, you felt a fuckin' slap
You could sniff that line and know that shit was smack
They should have never let a nigga in
Let alone let a nigga back
And now I'm kinda mad
Cuz
This industry
Told me I wouldn't last
I bite my tongue
Lock my jaw, hold my mouth and I still laugh
Put everyone on blast in front of my blam blam
Get to the club
Then I beat on they' buzz like
Bam Bam
Damn
How the fuck did I get here
Last year I was a nobody
I mean
Nobody had ever dreamed
I would make it past the common fear
Of risk taking
I'm racing like a Jamacian
On steroids running the 400 my skill is unfair
I can write fucking circles round yo ass like a small booty getting prepared for butt shots here...
So Listen up, I'm a killa
Don't mix it up
I might kill yeah
Behind your back like I'm Bishop
When I attack like militia
The type to buss on ya sister
Then hug your mom after hittin' her
And if the semi don't hit ya
I drop a bomb that won't miss ya
That's for ya family mister
Miyagi kicking that knowledge
Like Uncle Sam when I bitch ya
Give me yo' money
Li'l buddy
Or I'll be forced to come get ya
Kick open the door
Like who is ya?
Get down on the floor like I
Pimped ya
Now I'm on an island like skipper
With a bad lil bitch...former stripper
You know we' gone off the liquor

(HOOK)

Don't look at me and think you can't be touched cuz ahh...
I might
Might
I might just bust
Got my Uptown niggas and they don't give a fuck an' ahh...
They might they might they might just bust
Got my Landover niggas with, the flock in the cut and ahh...
They might they might they might just bust
Know some Southside niggas that do not give a fuck and ahh...
They will bust

(Verse 2)

Niggas wonder how my buzz growing?
I did a damn good job, right?
Conference calls with my squad every single night
After that
Call my broad
She gon' do me right
She gon' blow the pipe
Like she Tina
After that I Ike
Beat the pussy up
Like what do love gotta do with it?
Nothing bitch
Get the lubricant on
Do it quick
For I lose it, trick
Easy E, he too
Ruthless

Who is this?
I'm that nigga that killed it
After I nailed it like it's Jesus on a crucifix

I'm with my Jews from Jerusalem
Told me if I keep
Making fire
They gon' make the flames lucrative
So I'm cooped in the studio for the coupe
If a nigga in my way, get the blakka then halooket him
Ryu and Ken
Couldn't kick knowledge
Like I can
Made your favorite rapper
Kick rocks like hiking
Climbing up the pedestal after that I stool on you fools like a goddamn pigeon when it's flying!

*bird noise*

I did a damn good job right?
I use to wiki favorite albums every single night
Eminem
Pharcyde
Even Gladys Knight
To be the best thing that ever happened
When I'm on the mic
Catching one way flights
No cash to get back
Just to bag contacts
Like I work at Lens Crafters
Back when I used to feel cursed
And a verse was the only way to get the hex reversed
