[Verse 1: Rev. William Burk]
Yo, what’s todays Mathematics?
Two plus square
The truth is the only light
Nigga stand by himself
In the surrounding of darkness
There’ll be no disc shining
In the square of the universe
Which is 360 degrees
When God builds he (?)
Perpendicular to a square

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
Hate you on a daily
Man this shit is crazy
It ain't worth what we (?) you
Sippin’ ‘till I’m cloudy
Just so I can maintain
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes

[Verse 2: RZA]
I love my niggas to death, down to the last breath
But the last breath, I'm gonna save for myself
You fake snakes
Only come around when they need you
Savages, biting off the hands that feed you
Come among the righteous trying to spread that evil
Blinded by the love all these years but now I see you
For who you be and what you are to me
Tip a ray magnet trying to get a charge off me
In the old days, I would give a charge for free
But nowaday, I’m charging you $100 g’s
Wu-Tang is permanent
I’m the illuminated (?)
Known to chops heads off at the hip hop tournament

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
Hate you on a daily
Man this shit is crazy
It ain't worth what we (?) you
Sippin’ ‘till I’m cloudy
Just so I can maintain
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes

[Third Verse: RZA]
From a small water cacoon
Bent to the shape of a quarter moon
A small water pack that’s placed above the womb
I was fashioned by Allah’s
All men are created equal
Then tricked with wicked lies that separated the people
Then escaped to (?)
(?)
Someone tried to shoot Mister Robert Fitzgerald
The supreme original intelligent
The Prince RZA
Somehow mistake me for a old wise wizard
I put love up against anything
I put love upon the angel wings
I put love beyond the diamond rings
With true love nothing should come between

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
Hate you on a daily
Man this shit is crazy
It ain't worth what we (?) you
Sippin’ ‘till I’m cloudy
Just so I can maintain
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
