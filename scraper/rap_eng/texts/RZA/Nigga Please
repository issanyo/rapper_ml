[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I ain't no nigga
My words can't be held against me
I'm not caught up in your law

[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
All music must obey me
All pain must obey me
I cripple my enemies
Got the gift of vocabulary
I can talk my way up out of anything
Nobody's words can go against me
I'm stingy, I want all that energy
Osirus, the best nigga in the place to be
I two hundred hot degree
Burning ya til you faint y'all
Y'all niggas shooting blanks y'all
I'm fucking my vest, drive an armored tank y'all
I dead niggas like a dog buries a bone
You could never set me up I raise the pain volume
Nominate me, as presidential MC
My career so intelligent unique physique
A nigga please!

[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard & RZA]
You could never fuck with the dog
A nigga please!
Nigga I will bury ya bone
A nigga please!
I'm the one who burned ya home
A nigga please!
Watch your shit fall like Rome

[Verse 2: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
What, nigga I'm immune to all viruses
I get the cocaine it cleans out my sinuses
Just for slinging *nuh* I get a quarter a mil
I'll have it raining ice drops the size of automobiles
Kill all the government microchips in my body
I'm the paranoid nigga at your party
I kill all my enemies at birth!
Shut the fuck up!
Bitch and let me stick my hands up your skirt
Nigga please!

[Chorus]

[Break: Ol' Dirty Bastard (RZA)] (x5)
Nigga please!
You could never fuck with the dog

[Outro RZA]
Straight up! ODB type shit
Y'all watch out for the Abbott and Crazy Monk
Coming soon
Splashed y'all with the organic hip-hop spazzola type
Naw mean, Straight up!
For born-born and on
