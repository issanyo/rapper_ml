My mind flashed back to the early moon
When I was just a sperm cell in the fallopian tube
In the midst of a state of triple darkness
Going through a struggle so I could exist
Avoiding everything that came within my path
As I watch other sperm cells get ripped in half
One out of a million completes the job
And for the other sperm cells the womb is a graveyard
Though my travels I had to pass through
A lot of battles and violent hassles
Cuz' inside the womb I was a foreign object
I'm like a new nigga walking through the project
Trouble, everywhere I turn
Damn its a struggle just being a sperm
Cell, so I attempt to prevail
I guess the womb is the first stage of hell
Now here I am in the danger zone
My head and my tail, my 23 chromosomes
But then again yo it can't be that bad cause my dad
He could have used a body bag
And if so then my tomb would have been the trash can inside my mom's bedroom
But they was fucking, they was true to this
And here I go on a mission to the uterus
A million motherfuckers tried to race ahead
But I was the one that fertilized the egg
Then I thought then I was safe
Because I reached home base
But oh no my job wasn't done
In fact my troubles had only begun life is a struggle
Life is the struggle
Life is the struggle
Cmon

See the joy of life beginning
See the joy of life beginning
Oh sweet joy!
