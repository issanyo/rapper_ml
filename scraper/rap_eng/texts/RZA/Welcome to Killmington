Intro:
I make the heat!

Good God almighty, like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had to aim? our men to tell you what to play, how to play it, whether it was disco or rock, but um, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio, of course, complements of the um, the company, and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album HALF as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball...
All the real music's gonna last
All that other bullshit, is here today and gone tomooorrrrow

I make the heat!

Verse 1: Triigga (Tenninety Triigga)
Bro say tell em' where I come from
Trillz
I can tell you bout' my city and shit, like damn we lost Biiddy and shit
Yeah, so shout out to the techs, you know it's coast-to-coast always east to west
And RIP to Jeff, that nigga was a mess, but regardless that's my nigga and I love him to the death
I'm screamin' out Southside that's what I rep the most, and moment of silence to say RIP to Jose
You might get turnt up but can't turn up like Jose
When I'm smokin' on this dope I'm turnin' up for Jose
So every time I seen my mama I just held her tight
Cause nowadays you ain't' guaranteed another night
I throw the west up because I live a double life
Plus I graduated from school and still know that hustle life
RIP Jose he was nothing like
Them other niggas who was just a waste of fuckin' life
I'm like, 'damn why they have to take his fuckin' life?'
I swear that pain cut deep without the fuckin' knife
Yeah, that pain hurt nigga
Free Liil Merk nigga
This is The Takeover
It's my time now, but Imma hold you down til' the fuckin wait's over
And when you touch back down, it's still The Takeover, nigga
And then they took my cousin free da G, gotta love em' told that nigga how to heat
I knew him since a youngin' talkin' three
Cause that's been my fuckin' brother since the East
When we was runnin' round with them sticks
Tellin' homies that we down with the shits, and we gon' hold it down for the clique
Now everybody down with kill a snitch!
We gave the boys killa fresh
Throw up west because I gotta show respect
You the one that put me on to this shit!
You the one that brought me home to this shit!
When I was weak you got me strong to this shit
And now a nigga so strong to this shit
I'm pretty sure you niggas know just how the West rock
So fuck the law I'm still screaming' free Fresh Op
I said I wanna be a G just like Fresh Pops
Make me wanna go up the street and go and stretch ops
Or maybe start walking with the heat and go and press cops
Flyboy I'm bout to blow up like a jet drop
And whoever owe press can be the next ops
And have bullets rain on em' call that wet shots
I'm ballin' like I'm Jordan with a wet shot
Never pay for my recording cause I am the best ah
One more thing I gotta get up out my chest
Free Stormy puttin' in work for the West Block

Just let me hit my kush a couple more times...

Background:
Dolla dolla bills y'all
C-cash rule everything around me
G-g-get the money dolla dolla bills y'all

Triigga:
I'm just a young nigga tryna make it out my city
Welcome to Killmington North Carolina

Verse 2: Triigga
Welcome to the jungle this the slums
Where niggas movin' bundles totin' guns
Where they like to rumble just for fun
And everybody chopper got a drum
Shots fired down in the Ville nigga
Add em' up, body count, another kill nigga
I hope you packin' on that steel nigga
Cuz' if you lackin' in the field that's a drill nigga
So come in my city might not make it out!
I'm double-O 50 til' they take me out
And whoever not with me take a safer route
Cuz' every nigga that's against me Imma take em' out
Smokin' on this weed cause it get me through
And when they hit Jose it kinda hit me too
Y'all be singing like Whitney do
No jumping over fences runnin' from double-O 52
I can't forget my killas' snitches
Fuck bitches and niggas!

Outro: Triigga
Cause nowadays niggas in they feelings like bitches
There's a whole lotta killas and too many damn snitches
Now listen, got everybody all up in my business
Tryna see the fuckin' life I'm livin'
Yeah, so I just tell em' pay attention
It's one life, zero tolerance, nine shots, zero witness
And Rest in Peace to Joseph David Williams
