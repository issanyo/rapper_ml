Yo 5x
Ima keep it short for you short minded niggas
Straight up

(LZA Verse 1)
Peace after Revolution
Ascension to Evolution
Meditation and concentration
I'm never waiting I stay waken
Left brain penetrating: right brain is my representation
You hesitating you feather weighting I'm levitating
Through the pressure
Crystal line efforts
I'm christ like the sunny weather
Congratulations on your effort
But you made it this far
Just to fall so short
Life is but a sport
I'm tired of preaching my voice is getting very hoarse
Now I'm riding on a horse
Enter the horizon
Wavy baby like I'm the sun of Poseidon
Before you go to sleep an imagine a red light trident
It'll open the door to the highest I promise but don't call me Negrodamus
And then I woke up on a beach with the sand between my feet
With some veggies and fruits to eat
Damn this shit is sweet
Nigga smoking on DMT you couldn't see the 3
& 7 planes left motherfucker
Whoo!

Runaway
To make a way
Runaway(GOAT)
Runaway
To make a way

(ILLA Verse 1)
Mastering life is all about mastering skill
Master your ILL
Don't let the Matrix-reality distract you
Keep you still
Cause trying to move paralyzed by the dimensions in your mind
Will self destruct your build
For real
An all my Negus' know the deal
Holy Grail; Waves in my Cup Runneth Over
This smart water distilled
Holy Mackerel this wholesale!?
God's dope is never fish scaled
An I know
At times what i speak may seem insane but to sane
I'm that thin line in-between
So therefore pay attention to this free common sense
Like Mark Twain
This energy speaking to all inner-chi
So gain
The powers that be
Love for everyone we must obtain
This is an omnipotent game going on in the universes brain
An this Uni-verse I recite is the GLO
Rise & Shine from the pain
No ceiling to my reign; I grind like Dwayne
Carter; but I'm HOV in my lane
Oprah see my color purple circle
Own'n my name
Network it the same
Marzsoul ILLA As-salam by the way
An I know
The flows get silly like V.I.C
Swag knocking ladies out Layla Ali
I know I goes off every line like the handwriting bad
Therefore; ladies put it on me like I am TAB
Every mama love the D like Moesha dad
Oh! contradicted thyself
Jaleel did i do that?
I spit crack
Rap tight
An supply y'all with hefty bags
Full of that good full of that good
Bet them birds saying "You'll never make it"
Later tweeting "Knew you would"
I know them terribly bad bitches gon need some Soul
Want some Good
But dem like buffets an I chef private
So for dem me don't cook
This the Alchemic culinary book
Mastered like my mathematics that rule
11-22-33
Uh even as Michael
If you feel the truth I'm
Moon Walking on the Sun as I'm playing it Cool
