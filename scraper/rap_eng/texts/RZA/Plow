[Verse 1: Abstrakt]
If you wanna break this, I’ll be breaking all statistics
With the fancy use of all my lyrical ballistics
My style is malicious, you can call me vicious
Say your final wishes ‘cause you’re sleeping with the fishes
Flow is fantastic, I ain’t lacking rap tactics
Sacking on the slacking using tact when I’m attacking
We hired 7 psychopaths to raid a local laundromat
Of all it’s ancient artifacts and gave the people heart attacks
We stuffed internal organs in the back of a knapsack
Carried hostages in the back of a black van
We took the victims’ bodies to the house of a past-ex
Disemboweled bodies with the force of a vortex
Slicing off the top of a man’s cerebral cortex
Criminal projects, stalking on targets
Only the courageous attempt to enrage us
We scare them anyway, I got names on 8 pages
Coming from the 1st chamber to the 36th
A mind equipped with evil like the most dirty Sith
When worst comes to worst, there isn’t time to rehearse
If you get caught slipping you might end up in a Hearst
When little Johnny’s missin', cue in the search mission
But the mission is futile, there ain’t no body of the fucking child
You can check my basement, but I ain’t making promises
All you’ll see are knives and lives of people that are barely five
And blood-splattered walls, windows draped with intestines
Violence that’s incessant, and death that's excessive

[Outro]
