[Intro: RZA]
I wanna dedicate this song to the young god, Kareem
The Genius... Digi...
Say it to 'em roof angel

[Hook: Thea]
Learn to keep my head up to the sky
And ask myself why, it has to be this way
I'd like to live my life in peace
And health, not to worry about
All the dramas of the day

As we strive for luxury
And try to feed our families
It always seems that someone's in your way
I'd like to live my life in peace
And health, not to worry about
All the dramas of the day

[RZA] (Monk)
I met a young brother, about 28
Who seemed intelligent and rather quite straight

I greeted him, and struck up conversation
To see if the youngster had some self motivation

Peace brother, whats your name? How you be?
(I'm Rugged Monk and I'm all about the currency)

[Monk] (RZA)
(You mean gettin' paid?)

Yeah like my man's brother
Who has a condo, he shares with his baby mother

You know a condo beats my apartment
With no lights, no gas and backed up rent

No hot water or heat, infested with plenty rats
That'll eat up the average alley cat

(I'm like damn, homey, thats poverty)
(He's like) Word O.G. that bothers me

Plus I'm about to be a new father, G
(We need to wise up and change the hood policy)

[Hook]

[RZA] (Monk) {both}
Yo, why you fear the devil, as a grown man?
Why you not out there trying to make your own plan?

See we are a victim, of a situation
Where a wicked man, separated the nation

And got us killin' off one another
Black on black, they pit brother on brother

It's gettin' hot, hotter than July
See the murder and crime rate is risin' to the sky

(For example, in my neighborhood it's so hot
I'm often woke up, from the alarming sounding of a shot)

(So I'm thinking what), Is your neighborhood a trap?
{Could this be the place marked X on the map?}

(And I'm spotted like a target in a shooting gallery
So I strive to seek for a better salary

So I can escape from where? From this ghetto life area
{Cuz everyday it gets scarier}

[Hook]
