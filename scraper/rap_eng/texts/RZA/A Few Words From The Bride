Looked dead, didn't I?
Well I wasn't
But it wasn't for lack of trying, I can tell you that
Actually Bill's last bullet put me in a coma
A coma I was to lie in for five years
When I woke up, I went on what the movie advertisements refer to as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge
I roarded, and I rampaged, and I got bloody satisfaction
In all, I've killed 33 people to get to this point right now
I have only one more
The last one
The one I'm driving to right now
The only one left
And when I arrive at my destination...
...I'm gonna kill Bill
