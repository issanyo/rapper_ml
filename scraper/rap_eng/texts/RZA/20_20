With a, gun in my face, I flashback on the lives
That I managed to encounter, how we traded our vibes
Split second, saw the score, this can't be how I die?
I saw it clear in the back of my mind, no lie and...
*These are... the things that I remembered*
Calvary: How to be in private school and ghetto
Class of 99, we had our eyes on the medal
Had my mom married Geppetto, I'd still hold the control
Elementary: programming our minds into a hole
But learned to seek out the soul of a man, and expose it
Mixed race clan, in photos, I've posed with
White kids, Mexicans, Arabs, Africans
Both light skins and brothers who were blacker
Then, 9th grade I waxed into the mind of mobster
Fed from the strains on the love from my father
So I learned to be silent in my suffering like a martyr
Niggas bout the pie, til they realize you can bake
But if we slicing up the Sqrilla, I don't care which slice you take
Without vision, saw my fate was a maze I won't escape
And all was fine in my mind, until I seen it
That the fruit of creation is the attraction to Venus
So lean in to contemplate and find the meaning in between it
Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers
Starburst, Skittles, Now & Laters
Party Favors, Save the gold coins from Chuck E. Cheese
Now grown, and run to Vegas, cuz we on a chase for paper
But this Caesar's, not the playground
They will rape you out your sleeves
Break you to your knees, for those G's like Pesci
They say the world's not cold if you keep a colder Pepsi
But we're messy and selfish, for steak and shellfish
Most will metaphorically, eat your face for breakfast
Snatch you out that necklace, Lexus and Presidents
A new order coming to the world, it's getting evident
All the while, we never quit, in-spite of what we're dealing with
But if we all stopped today, we kill it, right?
As I proceed with these dreams of being Diddy
Seems like such a waste when our economy is shitty
When I'm low and look for pity, not an hour from my city
Mr. Gordy did the same thing with Motown over 50
Years ago, and here's a flow ahead of it's development
SWAMP Up! Natural growth is what I represent
Pop recommended that I watch the Earth revolve
Because the answers stay the same for how our problems should be solved
So as I'm steady on the job, the world keeps turning
Bopps are still bopping and the blunts are still burning
A man like me can only be concerned with bigger pictures
Meanwhile, everyday another obstacles delivered
I struggle to remember all the things that he said, like
"Life is like a Y, the left road will leave you dead" and
"When you meet a lady, choose her brain over her bed"
"You will know what they mean, pay attention how it's said"
We're eye to eye: he's so serious, I'm curious
What could make a father look and sound so furious
He grew delirious, I grew to understand...
That he'd given me the tools that I need to be a man
I've tried to recover all that slipped out of my hands
But sometimes, it's best to drop it and reanalyze your plan
In the quest for grands, you will lose and gain plenty
Enemies and friends, you shall match and meet many
Keep your eyes on HIM and HE won't lead you astray
Hindsight is 20/20, learn a lesson everyday
And when you fall, you pray for the strength to try again
And the wisdom to know better so the next time, you will win
Lots of fun in sin, until they send you the bill
The charges that you must accept, and some still go on your will
Generational: and hate is so, prevalent, ignore it
Choose your path, don't look back, just cruise, never floor it
And if you can't explore it, then it wasn't for you
Just define what it is that you do, and stay true
