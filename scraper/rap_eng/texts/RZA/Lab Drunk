[Intro]
Wu-Tang worldwide, Wu-Tang, Bobby Digital worldwide
Wordlwide, word up, all y'all crab MC's out there
Let me spark y'all like this one time

[Verse 1]
Yo, I make your fragile bones rattle with battles, chrome barrels
Microphone arrows thrown strike like stone paddles
To ya head, you'll be spread across the floor
Dead and headed for a bed of roses
Needle threaded, one jaw off-set'ed
By the fatal blow, tornado blow, battleship
Naval boats, U-boat torpedo, you can't stay afloat
You sink to the brink of extincted animals
While I bang your head on the turntbuckle wild like George the Animal
Steel stinger, Killa Bee ten inches, sharp as picket fences
Quick to detect your intentions if they're wicked
Meditate, build the house on the next dimension
My flow is co-hension, you'll be stuck

[Hook]
Stumbled into the lab half-drunk
Honey-dipped, stinking blunts
Smelling like I ran over I skunk
Wiz popping junk, it must be that time of the month
But fuck it, I got to spit this verse from my lung
Stumbled inside my lab half-drunk
Honey-dipped, stinking blunts
Smelling like I ran over I skunk
Wiz popping junk, it must be that time of the month
But fuck it, I got to spit this verse from my lung

[Verse 2]
Pile drive your head to the canvas
On this mic you got no fuckin manners
You be duckin hammers, we be clutchin banners
Touchin amateur challengers, we try to throw off balance us
Keep a 120 grain gunpowder inside the cannister
You can't compare to one atom of my hair
While my verbal shot be drillin through the cave of your ear
Ricohet to the ceilin, of the cerebral hemisphere
Deflect off your medula, exit out to the rear
MCin is easier to me than breathin
And makin beats to me is easier than peein
Killin vibes is easier than seein
I be geein, and fuckin with the Wu-Tang Clan is wilder
Bitch, than skiin down a 1000 foot hill with broke skis
Blocked by rocks, wild billy ghost, steel needle pine trees
My mind sees all of the unusual energies
Tell me, have you ever felt a sunshine breeze?

[Hook]

{Verse 3]
Yo, your flower fist is powerless against me
Your cowardice attacks the master track alchemist, Rap Malcolm
My champagne stains silver, bullet lex 4
Millenium falcon, chest in a vest to protect the Wu-Tang's sacred valium
Chased by snake's planes, I race states police
We slay microphone foes, the size of robeasts
Unpredictable pain is inflictable
Razor blade will ripple you, death blow will cripple you
12.9 meter level, son, you just skipped all my classes
IhHit a rap gkid with glasses, then jack his bus passes
His sister was similar to Jaqueline Onassis
My sound chassis blast, rhyme script written, well-casted
Strong as safari hunter, calm in the Congo
Un-plug the dynamic microphone cord and hung you
From a towerin' speaker, I'll tape your ear to the tweater
My mental idea's are more severe than your heater
Innocent drive-bys, 85's shoot try to overthrow us
But they love us like babies, once they get to know us
Your flower fist is powerless against me

[Hook]
