[Hook - SpittinTrue]
SpittinTrue spitting first? This is something new
You ain't heard of me and Ekko? Man what's wrong with you!
When the duo busts, we ain't faking rough shit
I'm telling you, the two of us ain't nothing to fuck with!

[Verse 1 - SpittinTrue]
I'll come through first, damn E, back me up
Right hook, left jab, man he'll smack you punks
Gut punch to the stomach, no ice for you to numb it
Tough luck, you're the dumbest and about to get punished
Ekko can hold you down, strap you to the table
While I snap and crack your back and make you half disabled
Now your doctors have arrived and yeah we've got the medication
To get your head sedated as we break your fucking face in!
Explode and blow like Krakatoa, load then go and smack a hoe I'm
'Bout to let these wankers know I'll boast my prose 'till rap is no more
Battle 'till you have a coma, tackle like I ran 'em over
Harsh cause I don't practice yoga, show these foes the knack for flowing
Sticking my fucking teeth around the evilest person's gun
Police arrive at the scene, and I'll turn them into murderers
Then get 'em sent to hell, escape and flee with the virgins and
Show them my dick, wrapped around my fucking knee like a tourniquet

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Ekko]
I'm coming in strong like Louis Arm- Backup!
Crew starts to act up, stacks start to rack up!
Imma carrier like a Louis Vuitton
Holding energy as I'm doing this song!
Get the turntable going, I do more than produce!
I produce rhymes like Seuss, and they deuce
So if you want beef, then bring the ruckus
SpittinTrue and Ekko ain't nothin to fuck with!
Ready, set, go, call me Das EFX!
Paper 'stead of pigskin, so I toss the text
Hip Hop's dead cause I murdered it, like Nas, I vex
This disorienting pleasure like cross eyed sex!
Me and SpittinTrue, we household names
Confusing mothafuckas like a mouse bold! Changed
Rap for the better, now, how we play?
To the limit! Never stopping! And now we say-

[Hook x2]
