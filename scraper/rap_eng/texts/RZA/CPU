[Verse 1: Raury]
It's a long life
And I don't wanna walk alone
Past midnight
I finally get you on the phone
I know I did you wrong
Please don't leave me alone
You said I can't love you right
But girl I can love you right
Cause I could lose it all in the flames

[Chorus: Raury]
And still have you
You

[Verse 2: Raury]
Bein' spiteful
Stop doin' shit to get in my head
But I want you
So I don't even get upset
It's just cause I did you wrong
You just want to do me wrong
You said I can't love you right
But two wrongs don't make it right
And even through all of this pain

[Chorus: Raury]
I still want you
You

[Interlude]
Bitches be havin' beef with me that I don't even know about
That shit stupid
You know what, tell these bitches to go get a bone
Cause I'm a real player, player

[Verse 3: Raury]
Good, good, get this understood
I ain't out here lumberjackin' but I wish I would
Fuck with another nigga, what with another nigga
I'ma swear to God, you'll be stuck with another nigga
And I thought you loved the clouds
So just tell me of a place that you just wanna go
We can take a quick vacation, no one has to know
Computerized lovin', love is all you need
Alalalalalalalalalala

[Chorus: Raury]
And I just want you
You

[Bridge: Raury]
Promise you gon' ride 'til the windows fall off
We will never die, we will never fall off
If this shit is real, baby if this shit is real
Love don't ever end, baby that's part of the deal, deal, deal

[Verse 4: RZA]
My heart's been punctured, I'm dysfunctional
Love was unconditional, now it's prenuptial
Corrupted by friends and neighbors, girl is crazy
Behavior changin', plans rearrangin'
Now I want you back, like "What's happenin'?"
Watchin' reruns of Todd Bridges and Janet Jackson
Different strokes for different folks
Shoppin' at Chanel for matchin' coats
Even though I know you want to slit my throat when I see you
I still want you
No matter what I do, yo I still want you
I can't be through, it's like a feet need a shoe
The sky needs the blue, I need you
