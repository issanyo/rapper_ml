Days of my Youth 2
Back in the days when I was young
All we knew was sneaking out of school
And acting dumb
Chasing these broads to get the buns
Spit rhymes play ball it was so much fun
Reminiscing on

Napoleon Da Legend [verse 1]

How you rise to your potential in the midst of crime central?
Wanna borrow games? how about the 5 that I lent you?
We gonna run it back minus Malik on the team
He be turning the ball over and his defense is weak
Feeling chic high top sneaks with extra large jeans
After ball we pushing weights I did my set to Mobb Deep
Paulâ€™s a hater had Decepticon and Autobot beef
His game was garbage probably studied tapes from Olden Polynice
Stretch marks between my shoulders and chest
I'm getting bigger mad at myself
When I would miss Rap City with Big Tigga
Most the girls would claim they were virgins like Richard Branson
Rocked the strength shoes and
Worked on my footwork like Barry Sanders
Rushing to grow up would fantasize on hitting clubs up
Most of the decent girls in school were acting stuck up
You know what? all this rejection built up my character
Flew overseas it hit me damn I grew up in America

"You ain't got a job Tommy!" Now he's resting in Peace
She gave me a hug and a kiss what an affectionate tease
She was 3 years my senior yet she recognized my genius
Big homie scooped me up his whip had extra large speakers
We would analyze flics like Juice and Menace to Society
Bragging about the chicks he pulled that sucka used to lie
That's his prerogative like Bobby remember Bell Biv?
Selfish for life T was allergic to shell fish
Copped a Bath Ruth and a 64 ounce slurpee
Favorite color was blue I used to hate Bobby Hurley
Nothing personal I was a Terp cops came we was alert
Jessica was teasing me to death she was a flirt
Scotty used to cheat he used to sneak to smoke weed
They sent his ass back to Gabon that's a country overseas
I had the crazy handles used to watch Childress Randolph
And write breakthrough lines like Ernest Byner on the hand off
The Wizards were the Bullets Manute Bol would shoot 3s
My mentor was Ron Williams I was told to do me
Doc's Gym Iverson used to come with Norris Moochie
When you dropping 27 a game you getting groupies
I loved it Naive showing affection out in public
Thought she loved me, that reality check was the roughest
Dreams of playing at the Rucker
Conversations were like "How we rank among the best in the nation?"
Slam Magazine Hip-Hop quotables in the Source
Rocking Illmatic in a Walkman portable of course
Used to watch Beavis and Butthead what a horrible show
How I grew to be a man only the oracle knows it goes...

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
