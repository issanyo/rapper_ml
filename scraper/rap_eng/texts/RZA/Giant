[Intro: RZA]
There are men
And there are giants

[Verse 1: RZA]
Banks and Steelz in the building, flash the camera
I'ma drop the hammer
Things done changed in hip hop
Since they let Bobby out the slammer
Hip hop started on the East Coast
Then it moved West, now down to 'Bama
I'ma bring it back to New York
Roll those blunts and throw ya hands up
Pass me a cup of the Goose
In the club with the juice and the bud, getting bent out
Then I'ma slide with a dime to my ride
And head up to my penthouse
Oh, I'm not tryin' to take it slow, working hard, caking dough
Open up twenty-four, we striving for that gold

[Chorus: Paul Banks]
I'll stop at nothing
I will play this game
That's so easily started
Not so easily parted
Giants, giants
Everything is shaking through the walls
'Cause we are giants, giants
Heart of David, you know it takes just one, and it's done

[Verse 2: RZA]
Fuck CNN, this is ghetto editorial, see, we like milk and Oreos
Dipped inside the audio, platinum plaques in my portfolio
My lines are fine as wine and blow your mind like cocoa
You can do what you want to do, whether group or solo
Boston cold with a bowl of chili
Summer cheesesteak on a roll in Philly
I'm a patriot, don't deal with hatred
If you make that beef, I'll smack you silly
Back on up on this, before you fuck with this
You better off jumping off the building or cuttin' wrists
Oh, got to heat up the show, raise the thermometer
I'm gonna take full control, hey Paul, let 'em know

[Chorus: Paul Banks]
I'll stop at nothing
I will play this game
That's so easily started
Not so easily parted
Giants, giants
Everything is shaking through the walls
'Cause we are giants, giants
Heart of David, you know it takes just one
To tee off

[Bridge: RZA & Paul Banks]
Novus ordo seclorum, e pluribus unum
They changing climates and replacing humans
And fracking soils while bulldozing forests
But they can't defeat us, they cannot destroy us
Are we dreaming the same dream?
Of money, guns, and gasoline?
And nicotine for the average teen, CFOs are after cream
GMOs extracting genes, but everyone on my team bein'

[Hook: Paul Banks]
Giants, giants
Everything is shaking through the walls
'Cause we are giants, giants
Heart of David, you know it takes just one
Get some
