[Intro: RZA]
KXNG CROOKED, this is Bobby Digital contacting you from cyberspace
The puppet master and his minions have penetrated into our dimension
We need you to make a full on attack
These evil dark forces can't be allowed to spread
This is a code red!
This is a code red!

[Verse 1: KXNG Crooked]
I'm here to kill the puppet master
Kill him and whoever love the bastard
My niggas dying in the streets, in the belly of the beast
While his belly's filling up with laughter (hahahaha)
I'm here to kill the puppet master
I see him hiding in the upper classes
He's using propaganda to corrupt the masses and cover up his madness
That's the motherfucker I'm coming after!
I'm here to kill the puppet master
'Cause he created this wasteland
Little kids so hungry that they can't stand
Their living conditions is worse than a caveman
So what's the game plan?
Use every second and minute to try to catch him and end it
Use every weapon invented to bring him death so head spend his last breath in the clinic
That's why my second amendment is in my waistband
His brains I'ma blow 'em out
I said his brains I'ma blow 'em out
Since he in hiding I'm knowing how to smoke him out
By kidnapping his kids, even the ones that his wife don't know about (shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up)
Man, tie these little bastards up before I hit puberty
You know what your Daddy try to do to me?
Tried executing me, sent his robots into brutally
Murder my community, broke every law and had immunity
Left us here to deal with the lunacy
While he on a date, eating steak, on a plate
With your whore ass momma, I had to deliver eulogies
We drownin' in tears
Our neighborhoods, drownin' in bloodshed
The streets run red, that's why I walked into my gun shed
No more speech, it's enough said
Nigga I'm here to kill the puppet master

[Hook: KXNG Crooked]
I pledge allegiance to this flag
It's just like a Blood, or a Crip rag
But this is a new federation
We gon' unite on your bitch ass
We gon' come right on your bitch ass
We gon' draw down on you quick fast
Leave your foundation in quicksand
I pledge allegiance to this flag

[Interlude: KinG!]
And I'ma make it to these motherfuckin' strings that he's pulling on don't worry
You better try to sell those dreams of being when it turned out we all broke
By getting debt over knowledge, get a job just to pay it back to the college
My cousin just got back to society, how he gonna work and y'all won't ever hire him, whatsup?

[Verse 2: KXNG Crooked]
I'm here to kill the puppet master, so he can feel all my pain and anger
Body chained to a fucking anchor
Dead floating under an oil tanker
He's on the board of the world bank
He repo'd my momma's house and the shit sank her
So tell me who's the biggest gangsta?
Is it a banger, or a banker?
He's pulling strings from behind the scenes
Control your dreams, with the finer things
Slave labor for designer jeans, blood of African minors all on your diamond rings
It's human beings against the machines, my nigga so this what it means by any means
We grippin' these pistols with beams
We clicking with different regimes to form an invincible team and send them machines to hell

[Hook: KXNG Crooked]
I pledge allegiance to this flag
It's just like a Blood, or a Crip rag
But this is a new federation
We gon' unite on your bitch ass
We gon' come right on your bitch ass
We gon' draw down on you quick fast
Leave your foundation in quicksand
I pledge allegiance to this flag

[Interlude: KXNG Crooked]
We got to kill him right now
We got to kill him while he's still flesh and blood
We got to kill him right now
We got to kill him before he unloads his consciousness into an android and becomes immortal
We got to kill him right now
We got to kill him right now
We got to kill him right now
We got to kill him while he's flesh and blood, while he's breathing
We got to kill him right now

[Hook: KXNG Crooked]
I pledge allegiance to this flag
It's just like a Blood, or a Crip rag
But this is a new federation
We gon' unite on your bitch ass
We gon' come right on your bitch ass
We gon' draw down on you quick fast
Leave your foundation in quicksand
I pledge allegiance to this flag

[Outro: The Observer]
With the blood of ancient pharaohs coursing through his veins
Tut leads his [?] into the labyrinth of the puppet master
Is this the end, or the beginning?
