[Intro: RZA]
Viva viva Sonny Chiba-ba
Viva viva Sonny Chiba-ba
Viva viva viva viva Sonny Chiba-ba

[Verse 1: RZA]
Viva, viva viva Sonny Chiba-ba
Me-a-me-a started small
As a Keebler elf then grew up to Akira-kira
With the real ninja scroll
My pen injure foes
You on the side of the highway
Crying like your name engine Joe
Supreme swordsman verses the spear-man of death
Executioner from Shaolin ? him in
99' politics breathed
Enter the dragon ? Kung-Fu
Shaolin verses the Wu
Shanghai 13's
Warrior from the ?
Hail wind staff
Go to battle with a fist paddle
Dragon fist to the horse saddle
Got the snake in the eagles shadow
Dance of the mantis
I done learnt the crane
This is a rebellious rein
? with the boys in ?
Wu-Tang rocked the world
Like the poison clan
Roar of the lion
Roar of the giant
The game of death is not no game
Viva viva Sonny Chiba me-a start more less a Keebler elf
The grew up to the size of Akira
Spiritual boxers
Three fight us, Sonny Chiba
Bastard Swordsman ? the neck off non-believers

[Verse 2: The Reverend William Burke]
Kung-Fu Like Chang Lee
I tell her train harder and use more Chi
Like a Foxy Brown slash Jackie Brown
She got an old soul her spirit free
My Feng Shui like ?
Five times a day we get together to pray
Her five-point palm will blow your heart away
But when she touch me she take the scars away
I sip Ginseng
I treat her like a king
With my Ling-Ling on the east wing
We might play some chess
I might castle left
And push a pawn across for two queen-queens
Konichiwa, she be at the spot
With the Hawaiian bra
Or the Tiki bar
She be with all her friends and all her friends are bad
But she'll keep you humble no matter who you are
Her body got ? In her Kimono at the Dojo she a pro-pro
She can go slow like it's slow-mo
I walk a fast flow like she flow-jo
She not ? with the soul ?
She don't sip Sake with just anybody
We part when it's time to party
She'll get ? like ?
Mad saucy when when she feeling bossy
But when she with me she know who the boss be
My trained assassin ready for action
My ? hit the ? off me

[Chorus: RZA]
Viva viva Sonny Chiba-ba
Viva viva viva viva Sonny Chiba-ba, Chiba
