[Hook 2X: Thea Van Seijen]
Bloody samurai, my feat will never die
Bloody samurai, my sword will never die

[Crisis]
Yeah
I'm like daredevils, I dare devils to take it to that level
Make 'em dig they own grave
Wit they own shovels
Sharpshooter
Drop helicopters, black out shadows
Cuz when it's time to ride, it's like pedal to the metal
Full fledged
Beat suicidal, leave holes with skull heads
Hit your cult for your vault, leave 'em all dead
And some
Nice swipe game plus handsome
Hoes hold me ransom
Get mad and throw tantrums
Seven braids like Samson, strength of Job
Since these niggas wanna trip, I make it all unfold
Didn't choose the genie
Didn't choose the leprechaun
Niggas better watch the gravesite
They stepping on Thinking it's a game
I rose him
Now your ass is frozen
Nuclear explosion
We straight West Coastin'

[Thea Van Seijen]
I was born as a soldier, and I'll fight in a field
I'll run like a hunter, and I'll die in the field

[Hook 2X]

[Rugged Monk]
The street apostle with Roscoe's
That'll burn flesh off your fossil
Make you suck on that nozzle
'fore you swallow these hollows
Clutching a bottle, yeah, I'm a hard act to follow
Nigga, I don't write raps
Little homey, I write novels
Every chapter I capture, the mind of millions
When I slang raps like crack, to the women and children
Bring down the building
Crowd roars oh what a feeling
Feels good like I'm puffing on that sticky chameleon
The street villain
Made most of his money from drug dealing
It's rules to the game, trust nobody that's squealing
Cuz snitching is a pet peeve
Like a bitch with a bad weave
It's not honor amongst thieves, nigga deal wit greed
I'm from a breed of real killas
That's cutthroat
That'll front you to work and kill you if a buck short
Bloodsport
Flick you like the butt of my Newport
Or with the butt of my gun
Take that, nigga, run

[Dexter Wiggles]
I come to stop the hollering and screaming, blaow
Stop screaming, make a nigga wish he still dreaming
Since appearing against a ninja, taught him barbarianism
South Central mentalism
Like the local news on the local high school for all this realism
Don't let all the whites go there cause all the whites'll go there
Have 'em all braiding they hair, and having tattoos
Aand street numbers instead of good grades from school
It's like ridicule, and what would Jesus do?
If he was standing at apartment, he was beeping with that dizzle
Like a hole ain't enough to end all ridicule
But a hoe'll get real holy enough to preach and end you

[Hook 2X]

[Sample]
If you win, I'll tell you where to find the number two
If I win, I have your head
Do we have a deal?
