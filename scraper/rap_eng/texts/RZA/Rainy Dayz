[Intro]
It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane
The war is on

[Verse 1: Ab Liva]
On rainy days I sat back and cooked crack
In Bug's house the kitchen light was dim from the crack smoke
Peeking through a crack back door for the police
Back room crack fiends front room we throw dice
In between sales on them slow nights cold nights
Kerosene heaters huddled over but that smoke make you choke
Like the residue of those lost souls
At the end of their rope like to see em lose hope
And have kids objected to this shit what a low life
But I am I was slinging Snow White
Sometimes when I'm alone like
[?]
My own life is fucked so this is what I chose right
Rap was just a hobby back then man I was so like
I didn't think it go right
So I met these hoes like
I was busy stunting for these hoes like
Rims on cars gems like a star
But there gotta be a better fucking way
But it was slow like
Babies Hades, is where my kind's go like
Feelin' like a raisin in the sun I can't grow right
Then I got the flow right now a nigga so right

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
When it rains it pours
The more the doors lift up the more the feds won't give up
Watchin' my every move the treasure chest is the pickup
A nigga with a gun and the juice I am Bishop
Trynna throw a studder in my step like a hiccup
Niggas on the corner testing me like a piss cup
My piss ain't dirty hope they know that my gun is
Child out of place I won't hesitate to punish
I ain't gonna talk to Russ the way Run is
Powder in my past reminisce on the tonnage
Add in the present and call it the second coming
I apologize for the destruct and decay
That was brought upon by my Liberace key play
Twist metaphors to avoid sounding cliche
Nancy Reagan dead Ronald put it in the PJ's
80's baby when the mayhem was born
I wear the rainy dayz like I was made for the storm

[Verse 3: Sandman]
I remember the first time my mom broke food
Fuck them jones you cuttin' up in school
The pretty bitches had me slippin, cuttin' class
For ass god damn I had my mom roughin'
Lord as my witness I still feel the sickness
My 93 Christmas when I didn't get shit
That day I gripped my coat and just moped
Around outside knowing that I'd find
Reason to believe in what they called the raw
Salesman selling cooked up soft for glass straws
Playin' the [?] all my work was moving
Pack after pack them 31 illusions
Cooking up minds of those with broke dreams
Seeing reality through the crack pipe steam
And all I seen was handles on the Beamer
Hammers in my jeans under the Sergio Tacchini
Bitches on the lenses of [?]
In their Benz's while they laughing and they leaning
And we never seen it
Thought we had it made and laid
Til the feds came down made rainy dayz

[Verse 4: No Malice]
You gonna have good days but better save for the rainy ones
So much pain it weighs on my cranium
Dollars no cents the walls are caving in
30 years my parents split I'm so ashamed of them
And so why swerve life throw curveballs
2 mill ain't got the nerve to get birds off
I compensate for my wrong I give a Bergdorf
I pour my heart in a song and that's unheard of
Especially these days rap's got a key place
In my heart and if it fails remember to keep faith
Cause I can't wait for Skateboard to save me
My house in default his house paisley
He's not at fault no not vaguely
He's on a yacht somewhere with Jay Z
Luckily for me I'm a hustler baby
Fly as 89 Guy you can call me crazy
