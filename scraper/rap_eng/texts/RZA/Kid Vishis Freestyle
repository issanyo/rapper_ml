[Intro: Statik Selektah]
And next up out of the M.I.C. camp
I'd like to introduce Kid Vishis
Pay attention

[Verse]
Ain't nobody vicious as me, besides Nickel
But nigga, a nigga nickel as me, a two of a kind self
My flow's so contagious, caught a cold from the greatest
Spill my soul on these pages 'til I grow to amazing
Eyes low, I've been blazing 'til the Lord come and get me
I'mma write rhymes, fuck hoes, smoke like a chimney
We could bump heads since you think you should
You ain't a thug, you a bitch from a rough neighborhood
Plus I keep the nine iron like I'm Tiger Woods
Blast you, ghetto tattoo half you murder statue
Stiff you like a statue, curl up like a cashew
I'm nuts, with what I'm stashing in the trunk of my truck
I'mma catch you slipping, when you do, you gon' get it
Stick up, give 'em hiccups, bullets chasing your liquor
Nigga, it's the worst two
Vishis and Royce got every style sold from gangster to commercial
