[Chorus]
You're gonna need an alibi
Cause you're coming home with me tonight
You're gonna need an alibi
Cause you're coming home with me tonight

[Verse 1]
Stop playing 'cause you know what I wanna do
This little cat and mouse thing ain't nothing new
Bad habit, you're the drug, I'm a fiend
Another hit of your love's on her knee
Got me on a high
Ain't coming down cause I'm feeling this right
I keep on burning for you deep inside
You're the spark to my flame and for you I'll ignite

[Pre-Chorus]
Why would you wanna wait any longer?
Why would you wanna wait any longer?

[Chorus]
You're gonna need an alibi
Cause you're coming home with me tonight
You're gonna need an alibi
Cause you're coming home with me tonight

[Verse 2]
Stop playing
You already know what I wanna do
So don't be killing my vibe [?] come through
Ain't no more waiting around, better make a move
Want you to [?] I got things to do
Got me on a high
Ain't coming down cause I'm feeling this right
I keep on burning for you deep inside
You're the spark to my flame and for you I'll ignite

[Pre-Chorus]
Why would you wanna wait any longer?
Why would you wanna wait any longer?

[Bridge]
We been playing for way too long
Don't wanna lose what we have 'cause it way too strong
Even though we know it's wrong
We've crossed the lines to the danger zone

[Chorus]
You're gonna need an alibi
Cause you're coming home with me tonight
You're gonna need an alibi
Cause you're coming home with me tonight

[Bridge]
We been playing for way too long
Don't wanna lose what we have 'cause it way too strong
Even though we know it's wrong
We've crossed the lines to the danger zone
