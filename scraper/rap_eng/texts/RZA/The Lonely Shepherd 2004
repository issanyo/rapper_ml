[Intro: RZA]
Yo, I wanna dedicate this song to O-Ren Ishii
We gonna bring it like this, down, yo
One-two, it's called the Ode to O-Ren Ishii, aiyo

[RZA]
This is an ode to O-Ren Ishii
Half Chinese/half Japane-see, half American
Oh what a specie, a feminine perfection
She had the sinister cat eyes, with the freckles on her complexion
Chief of the Yakuza, but she's wicked like Medusa
And she had Crazy 88 killers, *chka-ka* that'll slice right through ya
Quick to chop your head off, then wipe the blood off
A long range sniper shot she bust, never let a dud off
You got a minute to pray and a second to die
You see the devil reflectin' inside of her eye
But since she was a little girl, she never would cry
She seen so much pain and tragedy, I'll explain to you why
She grew up on the military base, where she had to face
Her mother, and her father being sadly erased
The blood drop from her tear drops, on her face, you seen the smear spots
She silently watched, as the shogun sliced through her dear pops
Through his thick skull, now she's vicious like a pitbull
And when it comes to hatred, and revenge??
*SSSS-SSS* Ahh, man, she got a shit full
O-Ren Ishii, half Chinese/half Japane-see, half American
Oh what a specie... Cottonmouth.., revenge is a thesis
She been bustin' off kneecaps, since the age of eleven
But fuckin' the enemy to death, that was her favorite weapon
And the debt you paid in hell, can't be paid in heaven
You better get on your knees, and started praying to the reverend
Bon appetit, boy, revenge is so sweet
Especially on a cold dish, she has no wish
But to cut your day short, like the winter solstice
And a chance to receive mercy from her, was hopeless
O-Ren Ishii, half Chinese/half Japane-see
Half American, muaww, and oh, what a species
