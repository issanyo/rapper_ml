If you get paid like the rent, represent

[Edo G]
Check it out as I freak that, nigga peep that
Mother'ucker you can beat that, while we keep that
Coming where you sleep at, you repeat that
We deal with the fleet that, bring more than Miami Heat and a Gat

[Scientifik]
I be the insane with the thin frame and the pimp game
You should maintain 'fore I blast your mainframe
Leave you in pain, everything sprained
I get bizzum, with the izm in the brain
Poor like Kane and Biz was all prism
Before I bust shots I prefer to bust jizzum
Though I must admit I know the art of busism
I can hear the chop with the cop just diss em
Dismiss them, piss them, no one'll miss em
I got styles and mad files you can't list em
I glisten, man listen, I take the mic and my hand break the stand like...

[Edo G:]
I spend time like a big, to get rid
Of all the booty shit, that's in the mid
So now you know, kid

[Hook: RZA]
As long as you know
As long as you Know
As long as you know, kid
As long as you know
As long as you know
As long as you know
As long as you know
As long as you know, kid

[Scientifik:]
I come to the jam, lifted
With my hat tilted to the side
First I shift it, throw a swift hit to your eyes
Scientifik, know to rip shit bona fide
Yo Ed, them niggas said we couldn't hit another (fly?)

[Edo G:]
My mind's in another state like a stomen
I could rip it [?], possess like the omen
Make noise like Roman, illining like Conan
The barbarian, rugged nigga from the bury in
Get your pin in your best suit to get buried in
You'll never win, got to come again, while we running it
Got you done again, just for fun again, still coming in
Number 1 again, yeah we won again
So they'll be no falling down like
Michael Douglas, check it spit

[Scientifik:]
I spend time like a big, to get rid
Of all the booty shit, that's in the mid
So now you know, kid

[Edo G:]
My number's unlisted, cause you missed it
Eat your ass like a biscuit with chicken 'n a mystic
I kicks it like niggas on a Friday, they number one
Getting high day, ground my way, on and on like a highway
And your girl like a dry way, get you side ways, for 9 days
Plus she brought the blaaaaze

[Scientifik:]
I have real niggas flippin', with the clip in, and they wide
Just dip in, with the fat Glock on the hip 'n
Trippin', rippin', the top on the nickin'
Sicken, slicken, all around sticken
Lickin', shots, vickin', spots
From the pan, to the motherfuckin' pots
Give it nots, taking punk's change like slots
It's the ghetto, Mr. Edo what you got?

[Edo G:]
I got to get you with the flav, plus I'm mad hiiigh like a wave
You could rave, if you're that brave, dig ya grave
Jump a hay, although I'ma hit you, when I snap like a picture
Then I getcha, even when you're withcha, crew
I smoke a blunt, drink a brew, that's just what a nigga do
I had to cut a few, niggas off, cause they was sauce
Getting in-between shit like floss, and now they lost
Only wanna come around for the video
Acting itty bitty though
Just like a silly ho, really though
You better act like you hear me though
Cause I have prepare me, yo

[Scientifik:]
To start beef shit, gonna creep shit, with your deep shit
Not the weak shit, peep shit, as I freak shit
On some roll, yo you better not sleep shit
I take it out like the Cleaver's in shit
Bulldogs, coming crazy storm though
As long as your punk ass motherfuckin' know
