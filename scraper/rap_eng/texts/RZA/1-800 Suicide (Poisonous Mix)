[Frukwan/Gatekeeper]
Suicide... a suicide
I can't take it (suicide)
I've failed, I've failed
For one who has disqualified himself from mankind (suicide)
Now I've dealt the deadly blow (suicide)
A suicide (suicide) cuz I felt inept to carry the knowledge
The mission (suicide) to teach the uncivilized
(Suicide) WHY!?

It was a pitch-black night
The frost from the trees cradle light
From the moon, as my soul took flight
Upon my bypass, covered my eyes fast
The comfort, going through turns, blown thru a trumpet
Floating on clouds of hands, outstanding Qurans
That blessed my tan, but took me back as man
Brothers that I met, caught in nets suspended
When my strength for them, is the pendant
Attempts taste the sour grapes the hate
The fame, sliced his own vein
Escape, the living, I see things different
As I cry, to end it all and just die
Yo, a suicide is a suicide
A suicide is a suicide

(Suicide)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, a suicide)
(A suicide, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, ah, ooh)

[Poetic/Grym Reaper]
Hey little bourgeois kid stop yelling
Come tell the Grym Reap' why you're rebeling
Your friend Marty got a new Maserati
His brother Arty got a brand new Ferrari
It really offends you to see all of your friends do better
So ask your pops for a Benz, you got a sweater
A pair of slacks, and a '94 Jetta
Shit was butter, but instead of
Gratitude, your attitude was rash and rude
Irrationally you started a feud
Now you Stand on a Gravedigga lot singing the blues
About the rough life you've got
You refuse to abide by the rules
Prescribed for life, as you grab a knife
You fool, commiting suicide, I will spit on your grave
It's barbaric as living in a cave

(Suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide)
(Ohh, ohh, oh, ah, ooh)
(Suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide)

[RZA/RZA-recta]
Yo, your life, you don't want it, your braincells, been blunted
Better run to your lab son and dial 1-800-
Suicide, so you and I can unify, U-N-I-T-Y
22nd generation, it's time for the Devil's elimination
The death that you're facing goes on without discrimination
Become attracted to my magnetic
All snakes who face jakes get strung, hung, mutilated, beheaded
Fang is shredded, then thrown to a sea of premium unleaded
Gas, get the match strike it and set it
On your ass, said you wanted to go over the rainbow
Well, you'll get strangled with a hot cup of Drano
Or fill your grill with a million sleeping pills
Make you drive a 100 miles per hour blindfolded down Snake Hill
The pick, the sickle or the shovel it's got you puzzled
It's the blind, deaf and dumb, well I come to dig them out the rubble
Double trouble, triple sickness, plus genocide applied
Equal suicide, a suicide is a suicide

Suicide is a suicide (suicide)
Suicide is a suicide (suicide)
Suicide (suicide)
Suicide, suicide (suicide)
Suicide (suicide)
Suicide (suicide)
Suicide (suicide)

Gravediggaz, kid (suicide)
Trying to stay alive in '95 (suicide)
(suicide, suicide, suicide, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Respect (ooh, ohh, ohh)
(Suicide)
