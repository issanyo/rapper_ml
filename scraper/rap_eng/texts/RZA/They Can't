There's no need to hate on us so hard
You can't stand the fact that we're so smart
We got the hell off the train before it ran off the track
Got up on this lucy thing and we never looked back

They can't handle us
'cause they can't step on us
And they can't use us up no more
They tried to funk with us
But they can't put a stop to us
'cause they can't control us no more

That was such an evil game you played
But yoru mouth wrote a check that your ass is still payin today
'cause it blew up in your face
And now you gotta reap what you sowed
Lies and deceit will kill your mind and eat away at your soul

They can't handle us
'cause they can't step on us
And they can't use us up no more
They tried to funk with us
But they can't put a stop to us
'cause they can't control us no more
