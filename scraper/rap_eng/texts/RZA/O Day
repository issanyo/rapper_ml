[Intro: RZA]
Hip hop is all about having fun, yo, yo

[RZA]
Sword still swing like Kenobi, ya'll cowards know me
Wit the strength of Samson, you still couldn't hold me
I got the rock stone from David's slingshot
Who could master the wisdom to which Rakeem got?

Watch for the cops, third eye like the Cyclops
Red from the chronic, don't need no eye drops
Slinging white tops on the block til 4 o'clock, then hit IHOP's
Fiends in line like I, Robot

Take a hit, and transform like the GoBots
Tell my uncle that I know what he know not
Bank like Agent Cody, on the hunt like rabid coyotes
Wild like forty Mexicans sippin' on peyote

In an all black Toyota
W's on the grill, steering wheel and the motor
Out to get deniro, til I'm paid like Bob DeNiro
With seven prime numbers that's followed by God zero's

MC epitome
But these ducka sucka muthafuckas trying to get rid of me
But if you decipher my lyrics, truthfully and not critically
You'll see I influence the world mentally as well as physically

Emotionally, promotionaly, devotionally, socially
Speak the truth, and tell you how it's supposed to be
Zig Zag Zilla cane, wisdom could heal a man?
Rewind that shit

Sword still swing like Kenobi, ya'll cowards know me
Wit the strength of Samson, you still couldn't hold me
I got the rock stone from David's slingshot
Who could master the wisdom to which Rakeem got?

Watch for the cops, my third eye like the Cyclops
Red from the chronic, I don't need no eye drops
Slinging white tops on the block til 4 o'clock, then hit IHOP's
Fiends in line like I, Robots

Take a hit, and transform like the GoBots
Tell my uncle that I know what he know not
Bank like Agent Cody, on the hunt like rabid coyotes
Wild like forty Mexicans sippin' on peyote

In an all black Toyota
W's on the grill, wheel and motor
Headed to North Dakota
With the cocaine, plus the baking soda

MC epitome
But these savages trying to get rid of me
If you decipher my words, truthfully not critically
You'll see I influence the world mentally as well as physically

Emotionally, promotionaly, devotionally, socially
Nigga, I tell you how it's supposed to be
Zig Zag Zilla cane
Wisdom could heal a man

Ya'll cowards know me

(Yeah, we gon' take it back RZA)
Who the fuck stepped on the wire?

Hahahahaha, so you thought you was going to escape, didn't you?
You thought you could escape?
Aiyo, let the wolves in, aiyo, son

Man, get the fuck off my feet, man
Fuck off nigga, I'm trying to do my shit
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, Happy New Year, nigga

So the mad scientist continued to drink the Digital Elixir
Fighting with the good and evil inside himself
Trying to be Bobby, trying to be RZA
Trying to be one, trying to be real
Trying to be unreal, trying to be super real, nigga
Rest in peace to the ODB, greatest MC of all time, greatest performer
One of the greatest performers of all times
Aiyo, O, yo, O, happy birthday, nigga, hahahahaha
