[Verse 1: Dan Auerbach]
I could take the pitchfork from the Devil
Keep a super-suit like I'm Incredible
From the deep blue sea to the dark blue sky
I'm the baddest man alive
I'll grab a crocodile by its tail
Handcuff the judge and throw the cops in jail
Make the meanest woman breakdown and cry
I'm the baddest man alive

[Chorus: Dan Auerbach]
I'm the baddest man alive
I'll take no mess and I'll take no jive
Sometimes I feel like I can fly
I'm the baddest man alive
I'm the baddest man alive

[Verse 2: RZA]
Not bad meaning bad, but I'm bad meaning good
Say my name three times and you knock on wood
Candy man hooks, I terrorize your hood
Flashing Mac's on a cop the way a gangsta should
I snatch food from the mouth of a tiger
Take a gasoline bath then I walk through fire
Bear-hug a grizzly, suck milk from her titty
Take the Sergeant's hat from his head and use it for a frisbee
Spit in the crocodile face
Have a ménage à trois with two female apes
Then sleep in a barrel of butcher knives
I drank honey straight from the beehive
Bungee jumping off the Empire State, butt naked!
Rollerblade across the Golden Gate, butt naked!
With the baddest man alive, and I don't plan to die
When the Grim Reaper come, I'll look him right in his eye
I'll bust in the face of the witch of the east
Tell a great white shark to go and brush his teeth, (ha ha ha)
I'm the man who stole the golden fleece
And I date-raped beauty right in front of the beast
The baddest man alive, and I don't plan to die

[Chorus: Dan Auerbach]
I'm the baddest man alive
I'll take no mess and I'll take no jive
Sometimes I feel like I can fly
I'm the baddest man alive
I'm the baddest man alive
