[Verse 1: Banks]
You're in a daze, sweetheart
You're in a daze, sweetheart
Just say my name, sweetheart
Arms away is a peace anymore
You're in a daze, sweetheart
The celebration isn't started now
Arms away there's no sleep anymore

[Verse 2: RZA]
What does it take to make an aching heartache go away?
When did we start the part and talk and dodge the words we say?
Blatantly faking forsaken pain use nothing out my flame
It's like you drugged me fucked and left the needle inside my vein
Forsaken me blatantly you caused me so much pain
You might as well just get a slug and put it in my brain
I tossed and turned, you turned my heart
And left me sitting in the dark
With the gat to my brain and I'm about to make it go bang bang
I tossed and turned, you turned my heart
Jealousy from the start and so much pain

[Verse 3: Banks]
Arms away there's no sleep anymore
Stay for the rains drink for the wines
Overflowing titres bear the prospects of a great mind
And we always feel the heartbeat
You're in a daze, sweetheart
You're in a daze, sweetheart
Arms away there's no sleep
