[Verse 1: JAi ALiM]

I might be young and fair in height, no fear of heights
But I rise fahrenheit, 21-2 to be precise
I'm post ill and pre syph
And have you chivalry, and leave you silent as a knight
That ain't no christmas jingle, ya knows I'm dope, cause ya senses tingle
Like spidey man feeling evil, can evil ever reach evil kinevel
And die by landing on a bus full of people
Action, I cut ya and put an end to ya sequel
Assymetrics, we all wanna see equal
But we treat people like Max Keeble
For renown, but you really precieved as a pre-own
Ya used and abused, matter of fact, you similar to a tool
A nut stripped with a short fuse
So be careful when you, keep fire by the fuel
Caboom, death of the weak auto tune
Shots fired from a regiment
My men are ill breack ya down to some sediments, crystals, and amethyst
Make a believer out of an atheist, have them thinking god he's a crazy kid
With the rhymes that i spar, i got more will power then 25 cars
For the cause, I dash off with a brutal force
While ripping radios out the dash board
Woop Woop Swag, then bomb ya task force
