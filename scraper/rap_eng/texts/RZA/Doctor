[Verse: Tinashe]
High, high, baby right now
Cause when you hold me
Don't, don't leave me lonely
Thirsty, quench it for me
Cause when you hold me
Don't, don't leave me lonely

[Hook: Tinashe]
Years gone by without one other
Can't go back without my lover
Feinin', feinin', bring me a doctor
Need it, need it, bring me another
Years gone by with now or never
Can't go back without my poppa
Faintin', faintin', bring me a doctor
Need it, need it, bring me another

(Ahh, so good)

[Hook: Tinashe]

(So good, and refreshing
Ahh, so good)
