Chorus:

Bang your head... bang, your, head!
Bang your head... bang, your, head!

[Grym Reaper] Rzarector!

[Rzarector]
Yo I'm not the same that I was when I was younger
I roll with a Clan from a land, down under
Deep in the darkness, we strike you regardless
Of who? It's obvious! me... ha!
Surround in a burial ground appoint my death spot
I build my house on top of Salem's Lot
Front porch bloody, back yard, muddy
Like Amityville, my family kills
Thoughts of humanity, drove me to insanity
To all of my rivalries, I speak of profanity
Motherfuck this! Motherfuck that! Bang your, head!

Chorus

[Grym Reaper]
Here comes the killer with the Gravedigga sword, gimme room
Like devils in a Ouiji board I'm spellin' doom
Ever since six, throwin' mad stones
And sticks capture dips on the graveyard shift
Digging ain't a new phenom because my crew is on
Spots are blown like nuclear bombs
With the killer instinct, rhymes are in synch
B-B-B-B-Bang your head til it shrinks!
Midnight marauder, bodies are getting slaughtered
Bring a cross and a bucket of holy water
So stealing can't be controlled so mother fucking grave dig em'
Slide out your head stone stack up your body, just like a clepto
Let's go, to the graveyard plot
Count up the knots, on the bodies that got robbed
So bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!

Chorus x 2

[Somebody (Don't know who's voice)]
Gatekeep!

[Gatekeeper]
Yo
I creep with the evil intent to represent
Of course, the night, is one with the dark force
The killer brigade, twelve o'clock starts the raid
Torches lit over your grave
Feel no pain though exposed to the raven
Deep in every step of blood like Wes Craven
Yo! I eject the fume that spells doom
The wickedest flow, sweep, ya up like a broom
Crept from the shadowy graves of Medina ha!
You're one stop away from the arena of death
Boom, bang! Here I am, the bezerk
The ruthless killer yo, I do work
Dark force is thick, mother fuckers for real
Here's a tale from the crypt, bang your head!
