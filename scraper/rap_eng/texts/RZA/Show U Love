[Intro: RZA]
Heheheheheh, hahahahahahah
So, anything it takes to fight
Hehehehehehehe, hahahahahaha
As the snowflakes start to fall
Bobby thought to himself, can he possibly survive?
Then out of nowhere a stream of energy struck
As he boosted, joined energy wit the Sun
The Seven is shining, and the kids all felt happy!
You are listening to the worlwide Digital Radio Show
Where we play hiphop uncut, unedited
Wit very few commercial interruptions

[RZA]
Yeah, Bobby, word
BOODOODOODOODOODOO
Why? Where? Where?
BOODOODOODOODOODOO
Just Bobby, yo, Digi Digi
DOODOODOODOO, yo, yo..

We interupt this program to bring you a special bulletin
Bob Digital located inside the hood again
Last seen helpin the crack fiend in detox
Smackin this cat in his head for snatchin Reeboks
Cut the dreadlocks, son, now rock the bald Caesar
Allow God to slip through the shit more easier
Police pulsated that they almost trapped Bobby
Near the staircase outside a 240 lobby
But son just disappeared in thin air
Where you crab niggas want to go, I've been there
Carry big guns, without bein parried
Yo, Cali niggas say its carried
Yo, don't waste your mind on time, don't chase the blind
Don't eat swine, don't play with loaded 9's
Don't quote weak rhymes
If you approached by a brother in need, give him shine
Show him light, don't get emotional, son, don't fight
Unless it's self-defense, to break the savage backs
So he's crew could be convinced
That any time you cross the line, we snap spines
Split ya melon, down to the rind
You be fucked up, yo..
From the way I talk, no tellin what you might hear
BOODOODOODOO
The words of wisdom is like a magnet to the ear

[Break - RZA]
We've come to +Show U Love+, son, we've come to show you
Whether you my bitch, my nigga, or I don't know you
Wu-Tang +Show U Love+, so let me show you
Whether you my bitch, my nigga, or I don't know you
I said, we've come to +Show U Love+, son, so let me show you
Whether you my bitch, my nigga, or I don't know you

[RZA]
Bobby stainless, son, you must be brainless
Drill through ya jugular vein with my canis
Do love your brother, son, do show kindness
Do speak the truth, deal in refinement
Love God, or there'll be iron flyin at you
From 4 corners of the Earth, God's eyein at you
A wall full of eyes, makin demons in disguise
As naked women, walkin sour lemon
Every head, high-pitched bird, fly canary
Body's vary, tck-a-chk, wisdom is secondary
The most necessary, they daze you
And blaze you, faze you out
Wu-Tang razor blade may raise you
Wafflehead cats, you get sent back to Belgium
Don't have to tell 'em, like Taking of the Pelham
1-2-3, Bobby showed up, ya shit blowed up
Have ODB in the back with the Mac, son was tote up
Quick to snatch ya wiz, we sport Polo lenses
Logo organic, herbal fresh, hypoallergenic
You get stabbed by the +Shaolin Finger Jab+
Then nabbed, hung by ya toe like fresh skin slab

[Break - RZA]
Whether Aryan, Rastafarian, Syrian
African, Black, Humanitarian, Bolivian
We've come to +Show U Love+, so let me show you
Whether you my nigga, my bitch, or I don't know you
Wu-Tang will +Show U Love+, so let me show you
Whether you my nigga, my bitch, or I don't know you
Don't have to come in this shit and make me blow you
We've come to +Show U Love+, so let me show you
Yo.. so let me show you
Wu-Tang Killa Bees, son, what? We told you
We've come to +Show U Love+, so let me show you
Whether you my nigga, my bitch, or I don't know you
Wu-Tang Killa Bees, son, what? Don't make me blow you
Come to +Show U Love+, so let me show you

[RZA]
You might get splat by the black gat
Pssh.. Head split.. jigged up by the ice pick!
