I'm lost without you
I'm hurt without you
Can't breathe without you
I'm lost without you
I'm hurt without you
Can't breathe without you
But ill rise, for you
Fight for you
Strike for you
Win for you, until the end
Fight for you
Ill survive for you
Win for you until the end
Until the end
Until the end
Fight for you
Strike for you
Win for you, until the end
Fight for you
I will kill for you
Until the end
