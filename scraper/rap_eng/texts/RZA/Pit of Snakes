[Intro: RZA]
The pit, the pit (Ohhhh my!)
Yo, 1, 2
Dun dunna dunna dun
All ya'll mentally dead muthafuckas
We come to break ya'll with some information and ressurect you
From the mentality of foolishness
Yo, yo

[Hook: RZA]
Become awake and chop the heads of these snakes
It's better off then dyin' in a pit full of snakes
Tha snake inside your self, that be the first head you take
It's better off then dyin in a pit fulla snakes

[Verse 1: RZA]
The marijuana got my karma glowing, gold armor
Surround my body, I'm reachin a high state of nirvana
Piranhas are prohibited to bite the lyrics' giblets
Golden livin tablets transmitted by the Abbot
Blood related kin to King David's mighty men
I appear in the atmosphere like nitrogen
Oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide
Helium, xenon, argon, neon
Freon, be gone, I travel beyond
The range with a six ounce brain you can't respond
Dynamic semantics makes your mind go frantic
Hand picked darts razor sharp be my standard
Breakin from bondage and white garments, eye balls as black as onyx, hair gonna grow as long as a comet's tail
Escape from Hell, watch the gods prevail
What makes rain and hail, snow and earthquakes?
Goin through crisis, or mad devices
I thought girls was made of sugar and spices
Always wanted to fuck with mighty Isis
While others bow down and worship Osirus
I'm inside my lab stabbin rhymes on black papyrus
Your weight couldn't measure a snowflake
How you gonna shine on the god while you rotate?
I dislocate your head, your neck, your back, your legs
Your kneecap, back smack your ass bitch
And splatter your gall bladder, my mathematical data
Travels far beyond the stars of William Shatner
The retina can't report on my speed of thought
Then escapes from New York and reaches London on import

[Verse 2: Frukwan]
Stronger currents than my brains runnin rapid
Hereditary practice pierce hoes through metal jackets
War commander, niggas get caught up in the exhaust pipe
Get the frost right or suffer frost bites
Isle of the King, maniac barbarian
Sort of Romanian underground, subterranean
Five stepper grandson of Nefar, the rest of ya heffers
Thimble, y'all resembled Uncle Fester
God body escape through telepathic gates
Integrate, causin one mind to elevate
Stagnate competition like an earthquake
Causin the earth to shake on release day, diggin more graves
Master forte or black cherries block
Freshly picked out the cemetery, bear the plot

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Poetic]
Yo, projectiles lace the project isles
Organic, start panic when I wreck shit and smile
With more props than New York City got blocks
I cripple your whole knot till your ear dribbles snot
First encounter of Hell is facing Grym
Lacing human shells with radiation until
Cell mutation begins to permeate flesh
Like skins being pressed in barbedwire steel mesh
As 200 nerve endings record the pain
I cut like the Wu-Tang sword hitting the vein
The main issue for invasion of your brain tissue
Is your dismissal nigga, I reign official
I lack fear like a black bear, slash your chest area open
And have the whole world soaking within your haemoglobin
Then blast your lyrics beyond space and astrophysics
You couldn't be doper if you were if you were Noriega's chemist
Twisting the mic like Brooklyn fire hydrants in the summer
Banging like a 4Runner
Lyrically my formula is C-4 to the third power of ice, fire and water
This equation causes manslaughter
Torture upon the microphone with the type of poem
That strikes like Capone with a baseball bat
Why waste the track, I'm better than all of that

[Hook x2]
