As the night goes, the smoke flows, my eyes low
Coughing two lungs from 3 hits of endo
Take note of my vernacular, killer, but not spectacular
I’m stacking ‘em, attacking ‘em with tact, no slack, in fact
I’m planning my next move, strategizing like Kung-Fu
My rhymes are spreading faster than 2009 Swine Flu
Roundhouse kick to your face, violence with grace
Never leaving a trace when I come up on a case
Fast paced, sneaking in the shadows of the place
Hiding in the area beside your right cornea
Scaring ya, giving your town mass hysteria
It took me 2 hours to get the body and bury her
It’s a shame that the public doesn’t know of the name
Unless she’s a dame with blue eyes and a long blonde mane
It’s true, that I’m always up past two when I’m
Writing new lyrics that’s militant like 90 troops
’92, sparking off beginnings of the golden era
Hip-hop took care of profiling sheriffs
Putting up tariffs leave whack raps embarrassed
I’ll stab you with a carrot, make you squeal like a ferret
Coming close, I’ll leave your body in comatose
Coast to coast peeping the message that I would never boast
Unlike most, I’m the host of demonic ghosts
Clever, flowing in quotes, flowing like boats
And yo, don’t take my lyrics like they’re really literal
The shit that I spit here is purely hypothetical
Satirical, lyrical, challenging political
Hysterical, I’m blowing minds when I’m performing miracles
Hilarious, people wanna front but they’re delirious
Serious, how they’re alive will always leave me curious
Hearing this I bet my bottom dollar that they’re furious
I’m handling the mic like an actual true lyricist
