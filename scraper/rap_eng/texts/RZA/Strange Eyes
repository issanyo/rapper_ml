[Chorus: 60 Second Assassin]
Strange eyes keep on watching me
I see those strange eyes keep on watching me
Strange eyes keep on watching me
I see those strange eyes keep on watching me

[Blue Raspberry]
(Strange eyes...)
If things don't go we can work it out
When problems occur we can talk it out
Niggas all round up for another fight
They round up tight trying to get that money right
I'll be happy when I see the stress is gone
But the devils won't let 'em learn right from wrong
When I wake up, get up and get it straight
If I don't do it now, it might be too late

[Chorus: Blue Raspberry] x1
[Chorus: 60 Second Assassin]  x1

[12 O'Clock]
You right, see?
What's up, nigga? Let's go steal a coup
And practice kung fu on the roof next to the pigeon coup
And keep the stack like the big boy Cadillac
Fourty eight tracks, got my voice on the DAT
Samurai style for them niggas actin' wild
And them jealous motherfuckers throwing boo's in my crowd
Steve Rifkin feel 'em proud, Wu made it loud
Now them nine can't relax, Killarm' throw swords on tracks
Unite my Kingdom, Family Royal
When Brooklyn Zu saw you, it's a Sunz of Man jam
Allah, be the black man, '97 banned
Prob'ly million fans, niggas own this land

[Chorus: 60 Second Assassin & Blue Raspberry]

[60 Second Assassin, (Blue Raspberry)]
My niggas if you're uptight, time to get this money right
(My niggas if you're uptight, time to get this money right)
We run the million dollar scams with this bird in our hands
(We run the million dollar scams with the bird in our hands)
Grab save your sword from self and I swings my for delf
(Grab your sword from self and I swings my for delf)
Grab save your sword from self and I swings my for delf
(Grab your sword from self and I swing my for delf)

[Prodigal Sunn]
Yo, I'm never lonely in the battlefield
The apple they kill, official blood spill
From Bed-Stuy, East New York, the face of Brownsville
This sound is real, I astound, reveal
I peal a 7 mil', addicted to dope, coke and crills
On the street corner, they sleep on us, we keep burners
See them lame guys with strange eyes? It don't concern us
Bloods and Crips, automatic slugs to whip
We quit the drug shit, now we on some music and shit
Living this ghetto dream, settle mellow out with CREAM
My thousand man team, samurai king, keeping our thoughts clean
Keeping our thoughts clean, turn off your high beams

[Chorus: 60 Second Assassin & Blue Raspberry] x4
