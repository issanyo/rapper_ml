[Intro: RZA]
A billion, data, Bitcoins and microchips
Intel Pentium, silicon and biochips
Sitting on Oprah's sofa
My drink is on a solid gold coaster
Cigars with DiCaprio
I rock a Rollie, you still rock the Casio
Ace of Spade, popped on the patio
Aston Martin, powder, Blue and Pistachio

[Verse 1: Joey Purp]
I know that they are not who they pretend to be
Ain't no more convincing me
Money turn your kin into your enemy
Streets will turn your mans into your memory
I keep it a century
I got a lot of people trynna drain me of this energy
Broski had them ten a key, we got chickens, two a piece
They gon have to murder me, they don't want no niggas free
I know this was made for them, I know this was said for me
I'm just trynna tape back every single thing that's meant for me
I don't owe nobody nothing, everything come straight from me
Young nigga go get your bread, only thing that's bred in me
Some my niggas still alive, they already dead to me
Ah, young
I fear no evil, don't spit the serpent for He deceitful
I fear no demons, I buy the chains just to free my people
I dream of Porsches and families that don't know divorces
Wake up to warring and niggas dying and buying Jordans
It's been a minute, I been official, I been efficient
I been in corners, I been that nigga, I been in this shit
I been at war and I been relieved and I been addicted
I been recording, they pay me good, cause I paid attention
Uh, Young Purple
Told y'all we back at it

[Break]
Y'all hands ain't fast enough to touch me
You motherfuckers tryna box with god
You motherfuckers tryna throw rocks at the sun
I am the one and only (Purple!)
I am the true and living
You can't catch what you can't touch
You can't touch what you can't see
Godbody!

[Verse 2: Joey Purp]
Yeah, first they gon' love you, then they gon' hate you, it comes in stages
He lost his case and his lawyer Jewish, the judge was racist
I speak the truest, they misconstrue it, we incongruent
I need a moment, I need atonement, it's more than music
I doused the fire with water, I'm holy water to it
These boys so late to this party, it's like they're early to it
This feel like whispers in the pews when the pastor preaching
If they break me I'm crack and I crumble into Jesus pieces
I'm in the building, I'm on the building, I own the building
At sixteen sixteens feel like a hundred million
I'm smoking ke- [*static*]
