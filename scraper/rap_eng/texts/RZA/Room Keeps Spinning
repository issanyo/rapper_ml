[Verse 1]
At night I can’t sleep, I toss and turn
Cheeba in my pipe, watch the burn
Thinking bout my girl, she’s my sweetheart
Today she’s acting like a functioning retard
She took my car, brung it back in three parts
Late night call, to come to the ER
Friday night, she out with her friends
Her and them bitches done crashed the Benz
Man, I told the bitch about an SAI
Stupid And Intoxicated, while she high
I been told her, not to drink and drive
Now the judge slammed the hammer and she might do time

[Hook]
Yo, she’s all about the party (Friday night)
Yo, she’s all about the party (Friday night)
All she wanna do is party (Gettin’ high)
All she wanna do is party (Gettin’ high)
But the room keep spinning, the room keep spinning
(Round, round, round, round, round it goes)
Yo, the room keep spinning, the room keep spinning
(Down, down, down, down, down it goes)
Yo, the room keep spinning, the room keep spinning
(Round, round, round, round, round it goes)
Yo, the room keep spinning, the room keep spinning
(Down, down, down, down, down it goes)

[Verse 2]
I took a purple rock candy, at the dub step festival
Yo, I’m signing autographs, started feeling like a vegetable
Here come the sexual, sensual, sorta intellectual
Touching on my testicle, the music up a decibel
At night, she’s a freak, by day, she’s a principal
I’m sipping on Ciroc, I’m feeling type invincible
We sitting in the trailer, her head game exceptional
Up and down on the pipe, her porn star professional
Hold up, is this real? Everything is questionable
Let’s take it down a notch, smoke this medicinal

[Hook]
Now it’s all about the party (Living life)
Now it’s all about the party (Living life)
All I wanna do is party (Gettin’ high)
All I wanna do is party (Gettin’ high)
But the room keep spinning, the room keep spinning
(Round, round, round, round, round it goes)
Yo, the room keep spinning, the room keep spinning
(Down, down, down, down, down it goes)
Yo, the room keep spinning, the room keep spinning
(Round, round, round, round, round it goes)
Yo, the room keep spinning, the room keep spinning
(Down, down, down, down, down it goes)

[Verse 3]
Got a letter from L.A., it was from my ex
Said she had my baby, ain’t seen her yet
Five years done passed, I’m a daddy
I remember that ass, whoo, she had a fatty
A video vixen, act kinda grown
She said she can raise it, all on her own
She said see me money and leave me alone
Stress is a killer, then she hung up the phone
Fucking bitch…

[Hook]
Now the room keep spinning, the room keep spinning
(Round, round, round, round, round it goes)
Yo, the room keep spinning, the room keep spinning
(Down, down, down, down, down it goes)
Yo, the room keep spinning, the room keep spinning
(Round, round, round, round, round it goes)
Yo, the room keep spinning, the room keep spinning
(Down, down, down, down, down it goes)
(Round, round, round, round, round it goes)
(Down, down, down, down, down it goes)
(Round, round, round, round, round it goes)
(Down, down, down, down, down it goes)
