[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Rap shit, that's it, roll a blunt and pass it
Smokin' on some home, got me feelin' fantastic
Ash spittin' lip is similar to hittin' Badminton
Kill him if he's sittin' on my shuttle car galactic
Last pick, gym class, homie, you were that kid
Big backpack and with overload on chapstick
Ask Chris (Chris!), you was low on your potassium
Asthma attack every time you ran track
And then, rode the bus, in the front
You sat alone when eating lunch (what?)
And made sure retainers in container
Made your braces even straighter than the way he would debate
And his first date was in 11th grade
With Mindy Shu-Wang of the foreign exchange
Cause' he was the only one that could speak her language
"Trade you rice pudding for a PB sandwich"
Chris! What was his name? (who?)
Starts with an A, a blonde kid, and I think he's a jew
But anyway, nowadays, yo that muthafuckas' famous
Rappin', grinds Toni Braxton in Vegas
Got a side of curly fries and a milkshake
Fell asleep inside a bread aisle with a mixtape
Who ever let that guy in made a mistake
Cause he's gonna' try to slide inside every miss state
Miss Maine, miss Mass., misses Minesota even
Though you got a man you know I don't give one Iota
Yea, I know that Idaho Iowa anotha hundered
Told Montana that I'd call her back, Maryland you see me comin'
Cause I'm runin' cross the country from one sun up to one sun in
Yea I been lovin' hunnies ever since I used some sunnin
Now sellin' little youngins' even though im still one
If you see me in your neighborhood, better grab ya buns
Tighten up that ass fast ash gettin mad ass
Last to admit little dick with a fat sack
Bad bitches definish by a fat back
Pat in the sack bring it back lemme' pat that

[Verse 2: Boyder]
Ding dong, doorbell
Big dong, bringed out
I say my name and don't care what you think 'bout
Look up, big cloud, that is the result
Of a Brain Bang blunt, can you pass me the salt
Dykey, yeah I know you got some
Where ever you live is where I'm not from
Your girl upside-down, like a opossum
Wreckineyez says, "It's aweseome"
I wear sweatpants and just smile and shit
Call up beautiful babies and while I shit
And the topics usually consist of
When she masturbates, I am who she thinks of
I'm buff, and I make stiff mixed drinks
Make funny jokes then I give chicks winks
And I make their boyfriends feel all awkward
But all day I was studying long words
So I could use them on you
True, you don't like me, well it's all good
Cause baby I am Joey bag of thick jawns
That means I be hanging out with thin chicks
Yeah, I just chill and eat Thin Mints
I'll give you an example, for instance...
I'm just playin' but seriously
Will somebody please grab me some cereal please
And a phone, so I can prank call Topanga
Tell her that Corey couldn't beat me in Jenga
This one jawn told me I was a character
That made my head bit like a caricature
So now I just wear hats with some plastic snaps
And show up to your party in ass-less chaps
