[Chorus: Islord]
Fuck y'all analog niggas we be digital
Wu-Tang, Killarmy we indispensable
We never fall, we stand tall like sky-scrapers
...and justice for all
(So fuck y'all, so fuck y'all niggas)

[Verse 1: Killa Sin]
We move on MCs mechanically, strike nerves like Ghost's verse on 'Can It Be'
Hard to touch retarded fucks playing with their fantasies
Respect this specialist black, testing this will get ya necklace jacked
And name scratched up off my guest list
Party freak, you the type of nigga that'll hardly speak unless you spoken to
You throw a cold screw but sober up when I'm approaching you
At the same time we posting two
Niggas on that ass that's gonna do what they supposed to do
The limelight snatched away from you because it's my night
Killarm blaze hot in the twilight, you better get ya lines right
Half of these crabs can't even rhyme right
With dust flows, robotic movement and blurry eyesights
What you want I already got and that control
I keep my head high, hand upon cock and pockets swollen
You folding, you faggot ass fuck

[Verse 2: Dom Pachino]
Yo, my words should never fail
Shootin' darts sharper than a carpenters nail
Inhale life, exhale strive anxiety's trife
Blowin' smoke out my peace pipe
Ducking the snipe shot off the top of the White House
A cop pauses, war never does its many causes
My offense is my defense, extreme precautions
Moving cyphers, high velocities making you nauseous
Ya forcing it, terrorist extortionists aborting this
Space ship that's spacious face it, almost can taste it
Pioneer looking for honey and is it matrix
The case is if not ya basic way to make shit
Embrace it, knowing some day you'll have to face it

[Chorus: Islord (9th Prince)]
Fuck y'all analog niggas we be digital
Wu-Tang, Killarmy we indispensable
We never fall, we stand tall like sky-scrapers
...and justice for all
(So fuck y'all, so fuck y'all niggas)

[Verse 3: RZA]
Hard to grapple my razor sharp scalpel technique
Slaps you, invasion body snatch you, money grip
I smoke the honey dip blunts, cherry bomb very calm
Verse bursts like a shot from the Berry homes
You'd be most wise to pay close attention to Willie Lynch-in'
It's stupid to fuck with Bobby Steel's henchmen
I step into presidential credentials
It's evident, my potential be infinite
Deluxe magnetic flux invincible, Obi-Wan Kenobi
Sword record in Dolby, Alexis Colby broad try to control me
Pussy whip me like Toby
Fuck the local, I move global
Economical, give seeds promised fool
My info glow In the dark, Wu-Tang logo sparks your attention
Look listen observe, Killa Bee swerve
Slam like Dr. Julias Erv, still strike the vital nerve
Charter through the Magna Carta, trapped like Otis and Carter
Wild like a Shaolin child from Mariners Harbor
King I Divines, lost his shines
Head burst open like a bottle of Pine
Use penmanship when I write my script, blunt spark em' and them mark em' homeless
Killa Hill syndrome, peace to Two Tone
You must know me to understand me
And once you do, you realize I'm you, everything I do
Honey bee from the bee hive, evergreen freeze dried
Leaf smoke, Killah Priest from the tribe of Levi
Spoke, thou shall not steal or blunt spill
The indestructible Bobby Steeles is here

[Verse 4: Method Man]
Yo, in the heat of the night
My 4-7-7 Mash on the mic
Killarmy and Trappa John M.D
Full metal jackets 'cause some gots to have it
Kill or be killed only time will reveal
I think by myself and I drink by myself from '98 until
Let me know its real son if its really real
Understandable, self explainable, caution
John Blaze flammable when under pressure, interchangeable and still
Coming down like precipitation as I reign undisputed
How Johnny do it? Dangerously
Whooping cough (cough, cough), chewing off
Stank pussy make my dick sore
Bottom line be this, high explosive
Not for the average Joseph, come and get some
Hold eight and keep one, up in the chamber
Blast with my middle finger
9 swordsmen attack like the Four Horsemen
See me dog walking, strictly ghettio slang talking
All up in these guts, often, these rap niggas
Official we slap niggas with mad charges
Dope shit regardless
We usually take another niggas garments, what?

[Verse 5: Islord]
Straight up and down I got this rap shit locked in '98
Niggas can't escape the laws that I enforce
Like top notch politicians who be politicking
Slam through and expand total construction across the planet
And micro chip software placed in the rear of ya ear
As I slid to next year
All y'all analog niggas fuck y'all we be digital, shit is critical
Like the hallways in my projects
Similar to the streets in Tibet
Fuck that, I ain't playing with a full deck son
