[Intro: Blade: Trinity Soundtrack [RZA]]
Blade... Ready to die
I was born ready, motherfucker
Daywalker, daywalker
Daywalker, daywalker

[RZA]
Yo... Yo, yo
It's the feast of the blood with sin, unleash the beast within
I walk around, with the strength of a hundred men
You best be gone before I count to ten
Blood dripping from my canine, like a fountain pen
It seems I've been asleep for a thousand years
The way my world has changed, it brings me a thousand tears
Prince of darkness, they walk through the rays of light
To this breed of vampire, I'm the prototype
The shape shifting, mirror image, flash phototype
To everlast, an original red blood O type
"He was born perfect, and just like the great white shark, this guy has never had to evolve"

Daywalker, daywalker
Daywalker, daywalker
Daywalker, daywalker
Daywalker, daywalker

[Hook: RZA]
Try to use my name, that's fatal
Tried to claim my fame but that's fatal
About to bring the pain, that's fatal
Bite through your jugular vein, that's fatal

Try to use my name, that's fatal
Tried to claim my fame but that's fatal
About to bring the pain, that's fatal
Bite through your jugular vein, that's fatal

Daywalker, daywalker
Daywalker, daywalker

[Bridge: RZA]
Come on, walk with me
Come on, walk with me
Come on, walk with me
Come on, walk with me
Come on, walk with me
Come on, walk with me
Come on, walk with me
Come on, walk with me
Come on, walk with me

"You're not immortal, I must of heard hundreds of rodents make the same claim, and each one of them tasted the bitter end of my sword"

[RZA]
I strike back with a vengeance, the father of descendents
And I can't be deflected, by your silver cross pendants
Blow the holy water, you make the false images
One swing from the sickle, ahh, your life diminishes
Sting like the scorpion, strike with the force of ten
My blood is known to revitalize corpse of men
In the last days, they said the dead would walk again
The blind, deaf and the dumb will talk again
