[Intro]
Oh Bobby why do you treat me so bad..
You know I love you

[Hook: Intrigue]
But what I saw it wasn't me
But what I saw in front of me
Oh baby baby you was acting so shady
I thought that you were stickin' me
Another girl you're tricking me
I gotta go cause I thought that I was yo' baby

But what I saw it wasn't me
But what I saw in front of me
Oh baby baby you was acting so crazy
I thought that you were stickin' me
Another girl you're tricking me
I gotta go cause I thought that you were my baby

[RZA]
Girl you can't trick me
Nor can you stick me
You try to play slickly said you strictly dickly
But you and your friends you play the licky licky
I figured it out when I caught that hickey
Between yo' legs where your chocolate split be
Now Bob Digi gotta toss you like Frisbee
Out the window
Off and away you go
'Ain't got no time and no love for hoes, fuck
How many project sluts wanna nut or get touched?
And ramped up in the back of my truck
Or to eat the Benz up when yo' girlfriend would
Have her knees to her ears so I can slip in good
Bobby
Now walk the block with black hoody hat
Dog on the prowl tryin' to snatch the little putty-cat
They red riding hood
And I'm the big wolf
'Bout to puff off these pistols like I'm George Bush
And push push through your power-u
Goosh goosh explode my load
Have it running down your toosh toosh
Now you sneakin' around like a crook crook
Tryin' to look inside my phone book book
Bout to loose it all girl you shook shook
It 'Ain't my fault that your love got jooks jooks
It 'Ain't my fault that your love got jooks jooks
It 'Ain't my fault that your love got jooks

Hook [1x]

[Beretta 9]
C'mon man save it go ahead with that boo
Oh you take me for a fool
I send my sister for you
Claim I'm sneakin' sleepin' creepin' cheatin' you buggin' yo
Listenin' to yo' cuzin' mad because she a lonely ho
Simple fickle minded dizzy tryin' to insult I
Now you wanna go and turn around and then ask why
Peace be out bounce
Spread yo' wings fly
Me lie c'mon how?
That ain't god's style
C'mon man
You don't know me by now?
Three years in
I should of messed around but somehow
I kept it real
Girl I was ya' nigga' until
Ya switched the whole current
And if that's how you feel
Be out
Be out yo'
Be the fuck out

Hook [1x]

Oh Bobby why do you treat me so bad ... You know I love you
