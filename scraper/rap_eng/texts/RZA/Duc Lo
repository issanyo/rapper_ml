[Intro: Doc Doom]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ya'll niggas duck low
Niggas ain't playing no more
Yeah
Duck low, nigga
It's going down
Round for round
Nigga
Hit the ground
Yeah
Duck low
When them guns blow
Flaming your way
Nigga
It's real out here, yeah

[Chorus 2X: Doc Doom]
Duck low when the guns blow
Cause bullets don't have no name
Anybody can get it
Everybody is fair game
When the guns flame your way
You better duck low
Duck low
When the guns blow
Duck low
Duck low
When the guns blow
Bullets don't have no name
Anybody can get it
Everybody is fair game
When the guns flame your way
You better duck low
Duck low
When the guns blow
Duck low

[Doc Doom]
Duck low when the guns blow
Cause niggas out here?
Ain't scrapping no more
They'd rather put a tag on your toe
Niggas go to war
With tech's and calico's
"K's", and fo'fo's
Four-fifths and nines like
Pull up slow
Where them fools go
Right there
A gun can be a nigga's worst nightmare
Quite scared
My brother RU got shot
I was right there
Like damn
Somebody call a fucking ambulance
Ya'll see
My brother bleeding bad
Call a fucking ambulance
Cause gunplay
All day
In the streets of L.A
From sun up to sun down
Niggas be letting off rounds
Layin' fools down
Cock and lock the whole block down
And won't stop spitting
Til they drop a few of you clowns
Gunnin' you down
Just because you run with them clowns
So blame it on your hood
Cause they got you in some shit now
So expect it
These Cali streets is so reckless
Treacherous
And I suggest you don't test it

[Chorus 2X]
Duck low when the guns blow
Cause bullets don't have no name
Anybody can get it
Everybody is fair game
When the guns flame your way
You better duck low
Duck low when the guns blow
Duck low
Duck low when the guns blow
Cause bullets don't have no name
Anybody can get it
Everybody is fair game
When the guns flame your way
You better duck low
Duck low
When the guns blow
Duck low


[Doc Doom]
My whole team is ghetto street thugs
Who'd rather bust slugs
We young guns
Straight from the slums
Label us hoodlums
Ghetto Romantics
Will leave you slanted
So don't test me
Or with my team
Cause infered beams
Can make the whole scene
Turn messy
My sign says
Money and weed
Houses and phat whips
Loungin on the sands of Jamaica
With a fly bitch
With wide hips
My nine's my sidekick
Ready to die for this
Brigade that I claim
Black Knights;
We verbal terrorists
Cherish this
Like old ancient arts
In museums
Black Knights
West Coast Killa Bee niggas
Move like Koreans
For Per Diem
Jam pack coliseums
With blatant poetry
Double time to rhyme
So the plan goes accordingly
Triple platinum
And some change
Not far from ballin range
Hustling runs deep in my veins
My father's sold cocaine
'Nigga'
Damn shame
We got to live like this
My Father sold cocaine

[Chorus 2X]
Duck low when the guns blow
Cause bullets don't have no name
Anybody can get it
Everybody is fair game
When the guns flame your way
You better
Duck low
Duck low
When the guns blow
Duck low
Duck low
When the guns blow
Cause bullets don't have no name
Anybody can get it
Everybody is fair game
When the guns flame your way
You better
Duck low
Duck low
When the guns blow
Duck low
