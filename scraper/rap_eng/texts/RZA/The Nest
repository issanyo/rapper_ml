Verse 1: Rapture

Ain't no stop in this, Rapture be droppin this
Ready for apocylypse, rocking the whole hip hop and shit
Stop with the bullshit keep poppin the hot knowledge kid
My style authistic like shorty choppin' in chocolate flick
Bringin over da docks shit, even the pitch who locked it
Kickin it with the hot shit, sippin coke with scotch kid
Im all over ya nonsense, droppin silence
Faggots stalking around ready to meet Pac bitch
Taking ya clit hostage working the orange clocking
Love bitches in fishnet stockings with big knockers
Head boppers i promise givin the rill to rock this
Livin ya own topics and choke on ur own concepts
Martians vs goblins? dem watch us, twelve apostles
Stun gunning im shocking it, we bombing it, one top of us
Im the cover of subtitles and socrates philosophers
Blast these rockets like killarm' grenade shoppers
Survive in this jungle of concrete with full of monsters
13 got snuffed out, 18 back to the choppers
