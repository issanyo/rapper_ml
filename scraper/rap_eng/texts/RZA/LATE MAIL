[Verse 1: Finito]

HMM
Snake the pied piper
Aim so accurate you woulda thought he was a slav sniper
Shut up or I'll knife yah
Nothing like some fresh gin on a hot day in vienna
Bullet straight to the centre, can't believe it either
But the stamina be so weak he had to take a breather
Never gonna leave her
The bloke selling' the stanky stuff look like a beaver
Bronsolini in the bay, like an otter on easter
HAHA he yelled 'CYA!'
He left it for the roaches
We ride premier venues like the coaches
I'm the god of rap just like moses
Oh yes yes sir, can i buy 25 cents worth of roses
That's that like I was born like this farewell to the posers


[Verse 2: FlatSamwold

Spike my drink or my stepping stool
Backyard Pool full of blood by a wrecking ball
I dress cool, im a big man and make the big look small
5 kilogram of bullets and a cannon with a fireball
We 15, 14
Something from the forties
Stage crowned woldito down and its bound to be naughty
We all make rhymes, beats and we all kinda sporty
New Royalty, proved enough so give us the queen's corgis
Curtains up, show down
We shut down the whole town
New kings with new sound
Shut up and pass us the crown
Silently sneak off like the murder of a clown
We tour around like mad dogs at a playground
