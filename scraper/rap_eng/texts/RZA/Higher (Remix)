Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

(DJ Ill Will)

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Enough with the sentimental shit
I’m about to blow, nigga, keep the instrumental lit
Suited in the Pendleton I came to unclog these rap, blogs
Congrats hats off to Fashawn
You stupid?
I though I told you muthafuckas
Thought speculation was over when it wasn’t in the kitchen, like
You don’t know what’s in the oven?
I mean the shit is, fucking disgusting
How these lollipop sucker ass posing like they got it locked
Never go outside the box rappers, try me not
I’m off an OZ of GCK
Been moving at a slow speed for three days
Don’t ever try and come to the West
[Female voice: you ain’t never been to the West nigga?]
Without an extra lung, big gun, and a vest
Allow me to introduce you to your death
Opposite AK-47 F
Ha!

(Talking: I’d like to welcome you to Sunday school, man. Grab a seat, put your bags down, and take notes nigga)

Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

(DJ Rockstar)

They sampling my style fashion a lou
I hear it in they rhymes who perhaps just a few
Rappers need to get bruised and/or tooken back to school
Rewrite the rules or be just another mule nigga
Uh
A prisoner a perfectionary sentence I’m sketching
Like a window or exit escape your mental
I become a prisoner of perception
Roll up some indo
Listen for a second, it’s just info
This just in: I got a four eleven on a 187
Somebody laying in heaven niggas ain't playing in C.A
A lotta shit happening
Thinking about packing and moving to Minneapolis
Damn
We from a culture of capitalists
Cutthroats and savages the utmost embarrassing
Fuck, a nigga might move out of the country
If you want me I’ll probably be in Somali sitting comfortably
Dig?
[Talking: I want to go to Africa I haven’t been there yet we should hit Capetown or Johanasburg, word we ain’t been this high before - Sunday School man]
