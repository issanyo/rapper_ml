[Intro: Beretta 9]
Yeah, one two, check it

[Beretta 9]
Aiyo, what makes Kinetic get on some live wire shit?
Not much, but when Beretta, I'm on some set a fire shit
I'm no devil, but the flow is hell, though
Just on another level, I'm quick to tell you 'hell no'
And never trouble, I haven't been to jail, so
In case you see me there, don't think, I won't rebel, or
It's not, I don't care, just you're not playin' fair, bro'
That's where I stand, but you better get out my chair, hoe
Don't understand, but I bet you, hear the snare go
When I pop you in the ear, and your head bounce on the dance floor
Why you even think, you even had the chance for
B.O.B.B.Y., B9, and Diaz for?

[Chorus: RZA]
*Schh* You get shot in the ass for, talkin' that bullshit, and as for
You wild niggas tryin' to rap, like you bustin' them gats, ya'll dreaming
They be talkin' that they bustin' your cap
And they carryin' straps, but they dreamin'
Niggas be, dreamin', ya'll niggas just dreaming

[RZA]
Yo, chalked from the wood grain and alcohol, son, I chew barks
Spin your head like Technics, made you write the new mart
See The W footprint? Made from the shoe mark
Yeah, it's Bob Digital, bitch, not Bob Newhart
Splash through the Norwegian sea like Black Orca
Sippin' on weed, next beer with Johnny Walker
No scrutiny, no shipwreck, or mutiny
Got the kevlar suit, don't think about shooting me
Holding the golden scepter, you be folding
Bow to The RZA like the great King Oden
My wiz is mighty like is Isis, my son is like Osirus
Wu-Tang Clan be the wisest
Like Professor Xavier, got stock like Doctor Octavious
More Vikings than Scandinavia, you better watch your behavior
I be myself, so I'mma be the self savior

[Chorus]
