[Verse: Triiifecta]

New Diamonds...... & Brillant Cut Beryl

THANK YOU GOD FOR LOVING ME ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THAT WHICH IS IN MY BEST INTEREST

I call my brother sun cause he shine like the one in the sky
I call him sun cause he shine like the one of us all
Neo, flip the e and o, throw the n within
See the end, but it really just begin
Surprised I didn't be it right away
But as Im long as Im right today
I ascended the whole entire time
Panorama bumping some cosmogramma
As I monitor my grammar
To raise vibrates within the lines
Much love dog
Bring peace god
Thank you for making us the ceasefire
We'll explore the reasons why we need to reach a Unity
You brought me out the thick, like thin soup
So my light body my armor all through this thin suit
Im illuminati
Keep your eyes on me, I reconnect minds, souls, and bodies
Secret societies could never stop me
Never fear, they already tried, and they already failed
Feel the field of the photons
Mass protons,Im like the Happy Mozart
Break bread instead of bogart
Keys to a lamb and it'll give away its whole heart
But no more, I speak that to a end and bring a new dawn
Preserve your chakras, destroy the drama within
Then you can build and ascend
Then you can spread to a friend
The spark from one can-do can enlight a million
I keep my third eye wide and all of my verbs reflechis
Thats applying to self
Apply the knowledge, supply the wealth
I feel alive, thats why I feel I'm obliged
Could never lie, I seen the sunrise from deepest inside
So whats a verb now, just an easel for all superb nouns
Add a reverb, mix the crowned towns
Down, watch us add em up
Never have enough
Best, always getting better
Like a number into letters
Like a letter into scripture
Like a scripture into pictures
Like a picture into heaven
Crystallized into Eden
Eden grown into Earth
So now all of us is eating
Light all up in the verse
So the light must be the reason:

[Outro: Triiifecta & NigelWahid]

SKYU ROLLS TOGETHER AS ONE, I CALL MY BROTHERS SUNS CAUSE THEY SHINE LIKE SOME!
