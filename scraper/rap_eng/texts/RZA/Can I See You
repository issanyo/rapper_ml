[Intro: Hell Razah]
Grand
Know what I'm sayin
Even though I don't see you, Know what I'm sayin
My niggas in jail, knowhatimsayin?
I still got my eyes on you, word up
Knowhatimsayin? another chapter

[Hell Razah]
Yo, you couldn't see me with a telescope
Worse than cancer smoke; your antidote
Give me the remote, turn them off
I'll let my album melt your ass to a cross, crucifixion
Camouflaged for the mission, use your third eye
To see the Israelite, detect those who tell lies
I see you magnified, I blend with the sunrise
Burn your enterprise, today husbands and wives
Become Bonnie and Clyde, carry .45s in these last days
In times, same shit inside or outside
Tales of the dark side, we still among minds
Keep the strong in the jail cells, the countdown for hell
Use the truth or you bail, let my words be the brail
For the blind who can't see us, like Black Jesus
Caesars, try to seize us, we spot them like cheaters
And turn them into believers

[Beretta 9]
Yo, I was born to survive, a soldier and I strive
With a duty to civilize these 85's
In their streets is a wiseman, an original black man
With a plan to run these devil's off my motherfuckin land
Unless you were close, when I strained the operation
Yo, check the first to tool, when I guide to guard your nation
For this military attack, surrender L's; draw back
Beretta take the point on this Sunz Of Man war track
I burn them like trick-alls, while weak brothers went AWOL
This new born god, and I'mma hold my life thrower
These fool keep their intentions, I destroy your intentions
For instance, we talkin this shit with no resistance

[Chorus x4: Prodigal Sunn]
The gods stay camouflaged

[Prodigal Sunn]
Yo, remember, I think it was September or November
A cold winter, I heard you got bagged and murdered
Informed by my nigga Glock, the observer
He told me, all about the fucked up
Thin number for a minute, I didn't understand
Then again, I understood good
Shit is rough in the hood
Before I knew, I was a Sun Of Man
Kept a gun in hand, stalking the land
Back and forth to the island
If it wasn't for the knowledge of self
I would've been seen death
Ashes in the base sittin on the shelf
As the years went, became intelligent to the nonsense
No longer livin like a savage, I can vanish

[Chorus x4]

[Outro: Prodigal Sunn]
All my people locked down for possessions
Word up, my nigga Islord knocked up in Harlemtin
I see you when you come home
From Crowns Hights, to Red Hook
Bedstuy, Brownsville, Fort Green
Word up to whole Brooklyn
Keep ya head up, one to yourself
My nigga Michael, Big Bo from Red Hook
We comin to get you
Knockin down walls, comin to get you
