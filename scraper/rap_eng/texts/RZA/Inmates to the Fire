[Intro: Prodigal Sunn]
Sunz Of Man got rhymes for days, word up
Faggot ass MC's, MC's is fuckin' garbage
Spittin' out garbage rhymes, faggot ass MC's
Word up, slap the shit out of you motherfucker
Tonight, tonight

[Hook x2: Prodigal Sunn]
Tonight is the night that you will lose the fight
I think you'd better think twice before you touch that mic
You could lose your life when you fuck with the right
Tryin' to bite, you get blasted with the pipe

[Prodigal Sunn]
It's one of the members of the round table
The Sunz of Man generate light
The third knight form the Concentration Camp
Burnin like the gas lamp
I came equipped with the gold as my wardrobe
Fully-armored, seven soldiers on the look-out
For Jeffery Dahmer, speakin a ministry
Combine in my terminology, fuck the industry
Cause on the top is where I'm soon to be
The holy scam connect with the Royal Fam
Brooklyn Zu, we ignite the jam
Fuck you and your Uncle Sam
Never gave a damn for the fakin and the phony
Scannin, my understandin, strike your dome piece like a cannon
You ask the question, why
Tell me, can you testify
Justify against the high nigga
I maybe do or die
My mind state, magnifies all lies
And for the spy, I keep em searching for the alibi

[Hell Razah]
We goin' gold D, The one and only, sharper than Shinobi
N-Y-O-B, kid your nosey, hittin' on my hoes is for old D's
You know me, gotta roll trees, rolly poley, behold we
Scorin' mass points off your goalie, you try cock blocks, stoppin' slowly
Ain't no way to control me, when I'm comin' for that trophy
From buildin' my diamonds like the carats in jakobe's
The unholy; government reports don't assume me
Aiyo light the trees, pass the fire cuz a lot of force Frank Sinatras
Singin' about street opera's, dead gun to be
Wanna-be Al Pacino's and Danny Devito's
Dressed in tuxedos, gamblin' their lives to gambinos
The blood suck the poor like mosquitoes

[60 Second Assassin]
Streets of fire, two on one man riot
Hired 60 Second 'ssassin, rap retirin thugs
Who was bug, when they new they should of dug
Fiendin to be a king, boy , knowin mine, I'm a royal flush
Shit'll drain down today, you couldn't maintain megaplanes
Shit'll totally freeze you ass insane
I be the headman, profession, should've been a blessing
Your next step, only peace that you're resting
Or should I say rest in peace
Dead respectively, knocked off your feet
Without a store, we stole beef
Another example, shitty diaper in my hamper
My Arm and Hammer, I'm cleaning stains at random
Take it best if you clean, 6o Second gee ya
Quotin in five minutes, I'll be five g's richer
You need to put your money up, you're only one up
Fuckin with Sunz of Man, you're gonna get bankrupt
