[Intro:]
Yeah
Shaz
Flawless, Corner Kings

[Verse 1: You-C]
Nerd flows for all the ninja sword hoes
Head is the future, is it delivery or DiGiorno's
Durry let me go first because I'm Qui-Gon Jinn
Against Darth Maul, but this time the good guy wins
I'm God's child, but I act like Satan's prodigy
So let me cause havoc, your ex-man is proud of we
That nigga shook, there ain't no such thing as halfway crooks
You either in or you out, like hokey pokey hooks
Backpacks with AR's for Columbine track stars
So run nigga run, like Snoop Dogg or Forrest Gump
No Frank Ocean dump, but I'm shitting on niggas. Pause
I got you opened up like porno stars
You know, Lacey Duvalle, Bella Moretti
Nut on they face, they got one eye open, call them Fetty
Call me petty, but fuck it, I got a way with words
A stolen notepad of pronouns, adjectives, and verbs
YEAGER!!!
Shaz Krew to Corner Kings, nigga!
7-0-Gr8ness

[Hook: Steph Durry]
I gotcha open
Been waiting on the moment
It's over, for any nigga rhyme against us
Make fools out of niggas
They go against the grain, but grabbing for a helping hand
Once again Gotta crush a nigga in his own space
I Gotcha Open
In full attention
Shaz Krew and Corner Kings, still tippin'
But never falling over
I gotcha open right where I want ya'
I gotcha open
I gotcha open nigga

[Verse 2: Steph Durry]
I gotcha open
Been waiting on the moment
It's over for any nigga rhyme against us
The squad shinning like diamonds in the light
Never lite, rising like horizons
We spit that potent, we gotcha open
We heavy loaded, y'all hardly quoted
We over average wit way less effort, so even if I slip
Still place me in the front, with a hearse in the back
Foul breeze around cause I been killing shit
Shifting my way through this rap game
Y'all watered down with y'all wack sound
Auto-Tune, foreign shoes, blow the opps down
Kinda raps y'all got, nah nigga this ain't Durk this Durry
You-C Me and Steph bout to step ahead of niggas, don't worry
They don't wanna box with God
They arms too small and short
My reach too long, I'm skilled to kill
For real, for really? It's looking Meek Milly for you niggas
Was Chatty Cathy til I gotcha open
And every soul in your set rocking with me
Ready to wave ride, while y'all staying sideline
We staying solid in this saga that must continue
The power circle still strong, all our verses universal
Wit the purpose to getcha open at any moment

[Outro:]
I gotcha open, I gotcha open
Shaz Krew to Corner Kings, man, I gotcha open
Strictly Stackin' Gang
I gotcha open, I gotcha open
On the moment
Crush a nigga in his own space, I gotcha open
Nigga! Shaz Krew to Corner Kings, man, we gotcha open
All this fire that we bring, man we gotcha open
