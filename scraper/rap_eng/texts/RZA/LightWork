{Intro: Tru V]
Yessir..Tru V...
Representative of the People
Reigning from Planet Earth
Got some jewels for the people

[Verse 1: Tru V]
Ayo' Building with my brothers and politicking with the sentry's
A higher intelligence is sizzling in the midst of this
I'm trippy mayne im different mayne
A shining star im glistening caramel skin with a tongue ring...
It's a must that I have her and the pussy bomb as fuck
Youngstown riding low, the impala tinted up
No dream in the headstash, choice of scoma OG
Hopefully I upset the current with this snicklefritz they pumping
Won't be hear much longer must prepare for my departure
Leave the books with the disciples so they can finish what I started
It's all an illusion lets dilute the smoke and mirrors
Pardon the confusion meant to aim it at ya' temple
Physiology and criminology
Adolescent development and psychology
Self educated own college knowledge equals power
Some incarcerated scarfaces still spending dollars
Garb of the age
Gold on my neck
White drape that's
Dangling to my dick with a sword to my left
You bound to fear yourself if you really understand
Silence the memento I'm trying to make it clear
Long stares you can tell we ain't from around here
Wolf pack Newark niggas mossberg's long dreads

[Verse 2: Tru V]
Shadowboxing with lyrics to find a different style of delivery
These cryptic innuendos got you sizzling in your element
Something in the shadows, maybe its the pharaohs
They starting to retreat so I'm going in right after them
And sending them right after you right after I get back
From a sit down with the Gods to discuss the state of evil
Gave me the jewels to shed the light up on these creatures
Broke 'em down to seeds and gave 'em out to my people
Warning label on them stated plain and simple
Plant these bitches, man they sure to cause upheaval

Used to have an ego, but I shed it
An eagle, but I ate it
Shape shifted
Transcended to the heavens
Living the life that of diamonds and guns
Mining the underground for funds To fund the funds of orchestrators
I was orchestrating operations at the age of 17
Team engaging in cold war for ice cream
Energy like the crown at the climax of prayer
Crazy bald heads in town im a be the one to chase them out
