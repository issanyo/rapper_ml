Yo, what up, dunn, (yo, yo, yo)
Aiyyo, peace, yo, what up, dunn
(word, just watching the studio
Got all the word on the street)
What you was outside yesterday
(for a minute went to the store, you know)
Caught them cats at store
Some bugged out shit was going on last night
Fucking with them niggas off the av. and shit
You know (word) niggas be bugging out there
(yo, what's the word on the street)
Yo, fuck that, yo

I heard cops raided the weed spot in 4D
Then bagged these two dreads and that 85 kid Corey
You know who I mean, he moved from Shaolin to Queens
Fronting like he was down with the Escobar team
(I heard T.T. got shot in the ass over some wiz
And pooky caught two to the chest but, yo, he lived)
And plus little dude with Lar, they got busted
(I told them niggas, don't be slinging while they dusted)
Yo, you seen my little cousin Shawn and his man Ross?
(yea, shawn broke his arm on the basketball court)
Word, his sister Bebe got got off form welfare
And those two nappy head kids got sent back to child care
Bathis, he got slapped by maljin
Acting like he had ah armor tank in his crib
(yea, that faggot ass nigga caught that beef from his rib)
It's the projects, dunn, you got one life to live
(Murder, he caught two for a triple homicide)
Mental rhyme disorder shit but never testified
Hold on, god, chill, my other line
(make it fast, kid, don't have me on hold for a long time
It's twenty cents a call and I only got a dime
It's hot on the block and I'm surrounded by crime)
Yo, aiyyo, shit, yo, check the drama, that was my little nigga hama
He said he just got some power-u from your niece tanya
