The Night the Earth Cried

[Verse 1: Poetic]
I want a queen on every continent so I can escape the government
Flee my residence, settle in
I'm militant minded, brilliant rhyme whiz
The time is now for me to shine, kids are innocent
Blinded, society got to be reminded of my diary
Cause tragically I carry the
Misery of centuries that's sent to me
Not coincidentally intentionally cause mentally
I represent the key but it's a double-edged sword see
Tryna be godly is hard
Especially in poverty's backyard where violence has taken over
Free enterprise and lies is idolized cause it's deep inside
Without Allah, God or Jehovah to guide the Lost Tribe
You're forced to reside on the north side
Babylon is never penalized for being offside
So many lost lives, I wonder how long before the herd dies
Today I heard the Earth cry for the first time
It was the worst time, it was the worst time
The way I heard the Earth cry

[Verse 2: RZA]
I came to the shores of America disguised as a peddler
The alpha and omega and the home of the beggars
The black settlers who been beaten, raped, lynched, robbed and stoned
And called to roam the Earth in service so they couldn't maintain at home
This dates back to 1555
When they captured the first tribe of men and piled them in a pen
Fifty feet high
They took 'em all on the nine thousand mile ride
And landed on the shore of a place they never seen before
But read about this inside the ancient books of war
Bonded in stainless steel, stripped of their language
Still survived the anguish of slavery but still remained nameless
Separated to portions and tricked by John Haughty Hawkins
And sold on an auction, taught birth control and abortion
Rulers of the first part became slaves of the worst part
The devils cursed God and reversed God
And turned God to dog and made people search hard
Notoriety came to the prophet of W.D. Fard
To a trauma, dropped our mommas off in Bahamas
And Barbados, Tobago's, separated us from slave boats
Made our own brothers hate us from Virgin Isle to Jamaica
Trinidad, Honduras, Haiti, Grenada
Bermuda to Cayman, mental enslavement
You black gods become awaken

[Chorus: RZA]
At night time you can hear the earth cry
How many more black gods got to die
Before we realize there's no God in the sky
The devil tricked us, that's the worst lie
At night time I can hear the Earth cry
How many more black gods got to die
You realize there's no God in the sky
The devils tricked us, that's the worst lie

[Verse 3: Frukwan]
Peace God for real, not a spook nor a ghost
Not unseen but seen and heard most of all
I'm God, control nine planets
Wisdom revolves around me, understanding
Science, huh my rhyme's underrated
Pyramids built and according to how we made it to be
Many shall come few shall be chosen
32 degrees below zero and you're frozen
Power of refinement my rhyme's assignment
Is to crush negative bullshit in a line
With the fusion
Cause that which is beyond 360 degrees is an illusion
Either you're deaf, dumb or blind
Stupid hypocritical, dumb 85 yo it's time
See I without me don't exist
God cypher love divine is what I miss
Check it like a visual reflection, sort of supernatural
Your know your mind detects as being natural
Ultra-gamma, the hammer's my energy
Compressed to a form of a threat toward my enemy
Cypher's a circle that consists of a whole
No beginning no ends no sides it's just a hole
Like in an event I'm a percent
Dealt out a hundred I'm 5, my degree is a black belt
Real genuine not authentic
Older than the Sun, Moon and stars unprecedented
In North America success can be won as a game
And knowledge and understanding still one and the same
Greatest reward known to mankind
That winners never quit and quitters never win in the mind
But in time my degrees are getting deeper
Thicker in the subconscious state of the sleeper

[Chorus: Frukwan]
At night time I can hear the earth cry
Wonder how many black gods got to die
At night time I can hear the earth cry
I wonder how many black gods must die
At night time I can hear the earth cry
I wonder how many black gods must die
At night time I can hear the earth cry
I hear her cry (Peace to the earth)
I cry
