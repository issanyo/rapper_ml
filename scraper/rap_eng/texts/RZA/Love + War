[Intro: Paul Banks]
You coulda been mine but
You coulda been mine but
You coulda been mine but
You put me in line
You coulda been mine but
You coulda been mine but
You coulda been mine but
You put me in line

[Chorus: Paul Banks]
If all is fair in love and war
If all is fair in love and war
If all is fair in love and war
What are you keeping score for?

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo she fucked around and cut up my rhyme books to shreds
She caught me fucking her friend in our bed
I used to try to tell her to stop talking to the fellas
Come around with that short ass dress and soft melons
Zigliani shit the deed to the crib
Balenciaga wrist, a gift from the kid
But we stay beefing, boo with no brocolli
Everytime I come in the crib I’m in the hot seat
Breaking all my watches gold plate Versace
You said you didn’t mean that shit cause you was toxi
Probably argue everday as a hobby
We used to be like Claire and Bill Cosby
So what the hell we held hands on the regular
Writing I love you on napkins on the table love
Completion it depends on the season
Cause soon as June and July hit we beefin’
Not speaking it increases
Feels like my love broke down to depletion
Then we get back together that’s decent
Last week you keyed my Benz and that’s recent

[Pre-Chorus: RZA]
She’s bitchin’ I’m bitchin’
She’s switchin, I’m switchin’
She’s talkin’ I’m not listenin’
I’m bitchin’ bout her in the kitchen

[Chorus: Paul Banks]
If all is fair in love and war
If all is fair in love and war
If all is fair in love and war
What are you keeping score for?

[Verse 2: RZA]
She’s high maintenance
She lacks patience
But for her love, there’s no replacement
Face to face, waist embrace, men chase the taste
And most will get sprung from the first engagement
I met her on a downtown street down east
Now it seems she’s always around me
And her love has astounded me, bounded me
There’s no way I can break free
A servant to her will
I’m a merchant to her field
I poured my heart out
And she let my love spill
Out on the floor the love changed the war
Both trying to win trying to claim the law
Infatuation morphed to fabrication
Passion kept alive through imagination
Opposite sides attract and collided
The collision was a bad decision
Two lovers trapped in one prison
Trying to separate like nuclear fission

[Pre-Chorus: RZA]
She’s bitchin’ I’m bitchin’
She’s switchin, I’m switchin’
She’s talkin’ I’m not listenin’
I’m bitchin’ bout her in the kitchen

[Chorus 1: Paul Banks]
If all is fair in love and war
If all is fair in love and war
If all is fair in love and war
What are you keeping score for?
If all is fair in love and war
If all is fair in love and war
If all is fair in love and war
You best secure your borders

[Outro: Paul Banks]
You coulda been mine but
You coulda been mine but
You coulda been mine but
You put me in line
You coulda been mine but
You coulda been mine but
You coulda been mine but
You put me in line
