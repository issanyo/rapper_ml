Let's say you say look at someone old like statues
See Buddha, you see laughing Buddha, you see the crying Buddha
You see a sleeping Buddha, you see the tall Buddha
You see the Buddha... you see the female Buddha
You see all these different, variations
These are all different kind of personalities
Or different kind of ways that they have reached the light
You can laugh yourself into the light
You got the drunken Buddha, I mean the drunk monk
Y'knahmean? That's why you can drink yourself into enlightenment
But the side effects of whatever you doin, y'knahmean?
Is gonna determine how long you're gonna enjoy your enlightenment
