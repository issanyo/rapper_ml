Riding in a spaceship 1984
Picking up a signal
Never heard before

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
Not just be your friend

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
Not just be your friend

Round control in silence
Im here all alone
Maniac transmissin
Chans were prove oure bone
Outesid in the darkness
Somthing waits fore me
Now I see his picture
Forming on TV

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
Not just be your friend

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
Not just be your friend

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
Not just be your friend

Whats this thing befor me
From the depths of space
Blue and green and slimy
It ain't got no face
Sending back to Huston
Get me out of here
Voices on the speakers
Wispers in my ear

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
Not just be your friend

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
Not just be your friend

Wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover
Not just be your
