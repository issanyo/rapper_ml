[RZA]
Yo, sting of the dragon master, one blow make your jaw shatter
Have you walk around with your face wrapped in plaster
Gaspin'....... *gasp*, like you got a bad case of asthma
Spot the dog, you try to run faster
Wild savage, but he bow down to his master
Washed beef with an ice cold shaster, he would shout

[Chorus: RZA]
I am free from you, so unleash me
There's nothin' else you can do to teach me
Nothin' else you can do to appease me
I know this point in life, it wouldn't be easy
I gave you my all, I would eat food
Out of cans, through my hands and all
Just to show and prove, you my man's and all
Didn't even try to make plans at all

[Prodigal Sunn]
My hand's cut in the outer, leakin' the contender
Hit 'em high, stick 'em low, break through the center
Somebody screamin' ambulance, yo, he bend a
Ghost like a ninja, whole 'nother agenda
Catch me day and night, ready for fight
Plus I spit more through the mic, four fist right
Chest, head, body blow, would leave, anything goes
Broken nose, shatterin' jaws, spark him with the C-4
P-Sunn did it from the east door
The more I tour, the more I score, watch the lion roar
Through the field, with the skills and agility
Martial art ability, bend the laws of gravity
Stay in shape, no cavities
Some wise words from a young one, trained to reach mastery

[Chorus: RZA]
I am free from you, so unleash me
There's nothin' else you can do to teach me

[Christ Bearer]
I am free from you, Buddhapest fist, Tai Chi, Kung Fu
Master siku, jujitsu, round house kick you
Forty elbows, then I left right hit you
Master set me free, although you'll never let me get the master key
Cause when it's time for beef, who could the master be
While I'm stopped, critique you see the master flee
But cats keep rushin', I'll back flip bust you
Crack your rib cage apart, snatch your heart, that's nothin'
Guillotine chop, to the Phillipine hot
Leave 'em worst, and sendin' them to Killa, get shot
I ate from my hands, and ate from the plan
Entranced, my face was a glance
I gave you my all, I know you felt my slave to, and thought
I'm sittin' fool on y'all

[Chorus 2X]
