Spoken word sample: I wish my dreams were as serene!

All we'd do
That's all we knew
You know it's true

There's just one move through time

Spoken word sample: It is always up there, high in the sky. Those who were there are somehow above and beyond vengeance and temptations

Spoken word sample: My eyes touched the sky!
