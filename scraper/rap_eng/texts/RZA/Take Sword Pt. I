[Intro: "Shaolin Vs. Wu-Tang" sample]
"Take the sword"
"The sword?"
"Come on, give me the sword"
"Huh?"
"Heh, you Wu-Tang are never gonna win"
"My lord, don't be afraid of the Wu-Tang techniques"
"Pick up the sword!"

[RZA]
Yo, ayo; chumps are in trouble, boy, tongue pay double, boy
I'm trump tight, you better go home, and cuddle, boy
I leave you ducks in a puddle, buried under tons of rubble
Turn your body, to sparks and stubbles
Hot lead from the cylinder, from my two-shot dillinger
Put that hot steel in ya, bigger not feeling ya
Bio hazard, to ya flesh and ya fabric
No need to scratch your hair, son, the clean to my static
Strange apparatus and gadgets, my bullets got magnets
Pop pop pop, we attract to that crab shit
Super superior stamina, there's a Clan of us
All of what bulldozers, hard hats and jack hammers
And leather Old Testament copies, I'll probably
Give you a out of body experience, then hide your body
So there's no return, so burn, baby, burn
My clique fucking sick, nigga, learn, baby, learn
I got Milwaukee chicks like Shirley and Laverne
They bite ya dick off, after swallowing your sperm
They slice ya fucking throat while you lay there and squirm
They related to the judge, so the case get adjourned
You chumps are in trouble, boy, I said tongue pays double, boy
I"m trump tight, you better go home, and cuddle, boy
I put your head in a puddle, buried under tons of rubble
Turn your body, to sparks and stubbles
Frickles and fragles, nigga, you're too fragile
Motherfucker, my brain is on Scrabble!

[Beretta 9]
Aiyo, back for this annual conference, confronted on
You wack MC's, it's duck season, the hunt is on
What B9 squeezing and game is locked, a run upon
Thinking that you were the shit, nah, that's once upon
I doubt my run while you sit, I bust my gun from the hip
Why even make you a song, and when you ain't worth a skit
My niggas kill for the sum, and the'll be cursed for the flick
Probably til midnight until, scheeming on pussy to split
And then we back like crack, nigga, take a swig of that
Twist a twenty sack of black, figure, oh he a good kid
Such a nice smile he had, oh one more state
Then I whip it on that, slip slipping in the grass
Sip sipping on the glass, now I'm dipping down the ave
