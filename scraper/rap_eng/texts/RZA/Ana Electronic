[Hook: Paul Banks]
You go up to release
You release you come down
And at times I can see your face now
Accompany a celestial sound
When the shadows keep your pace now
Even even the time flows
Even even the time flows (away)
Even even the time flows over me
Leave aside the beautiful lies
That’s all there is to lose

[Verse 1: RZA]
Love is a house and you got the keys
I’m like a city mouse mama you got the cheese
James Brown sung
Please please please, try me
Mama don’t leave
So how do we keep the music playing
How do we keep our love song from fading out
Even if the sun burns out
Mama don’t leave cause I can’t live without you

[Hook: Paul Banks]
You go up to release
You release you come down
And at times I can see your face now
Accompany a celestial sound
When the shadows keep your pace now
Even even the time flows (away)
Even even the tide flows over me
Leave aside the beautiful lies
That’s all there is to lose

[Verse 2: RZA]
When a man loves a woman
When a man loves a woman
He would travel far lands (to lose)
And cross the deepest seas
Send his soldiers to war
Like Trojans and Greece (to lose)
Many kings lost their lands at a woman’s hand
Marie Antoinette caused the fall of France  (toulouse)
So good was her love that my circumstance
Left me in the mud for a second chance
I'm in a love debt
Because I owe so much
She was with the Joneses
I was tryna keep up
Tryna keep my feet above water
Fell of a cliff
Can I get a lift, Can I get a tip
Oh ain’t that a trip
When love let you slip
Into a love debt
Into regret
But I would do it all again
Just to hold her skin

[Bridge/Outro: Paul Banks]
Time will take your place in no time
Fly away for days hypnotized
Even even the time flows over
No waste away
Time will take your place in no time
Time will take your place in no time
Fly away for days hypnotized
Even even the time flows over
No waste away
