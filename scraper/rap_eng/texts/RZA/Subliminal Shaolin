(Verse 1)
Watch these rap niggas get all up in subliminals
Criminals without a henny full in the living room
24 to life is a price for my spiritual
Well being hell sings for male kings
& im gonna be strapped no matter what 12 brings
Fuck thirst your bitch came first too ice cream
& now she like themes with demons & gold rings
& now im like scream for niggas who blow green
[Dont think]
That a nigga ain't gone thru it
Because i'll pull out the ratchet with practice and gone screw it
So nigga dont be acting like hatchet is mad good
[.....]
Coming to america fuxk a mr.mcdowell
Cuz i will fuck your daughter so hard shell be singing my vowels
Like A,E,I,O,U & sometimes Y
Sorry ms.jackson i ain't mean to make your daughter cry
Matter of fact i ain't even know i caught her eye
But i spot her made an offer
She declined it got behind it
& the rest is history nigga

(Hook)
Watch these rap niggas get all up in sublime
Somebody please tell the DJ don't press rewind
& everytime i find a female thats one of a kind
SHES GONE....... (x2)

(Verse 2)
[Man Fuck These Bitches!]
They dont want nothing but my cheddar
Four Beretta
Bitch say im a ho collector
I know protectors
Who know your protectors
So dont let us
Bring back more injectors
Go Getter thats who i be known as
Yo niggas got they GED cuz of no class
Ho niggas who we laughing at as we blow pass
Yo niggas be outside the club getting no ass

Cuz outchea ain't no such thing as banging for fun

(Hook)

(Bridge)
Im Like Oooh fuck these bitches
Cuz you know my ice cream delicious (x2)
Shaolin (x4)
