This a suicide note rhyme so, look alive, feelin' vibes so tight
No white folks with tight ropes survive
Like sliced sewn eyes, so psychos die
In heights so high, They die hangin' from tight rope rides
Like The Jim Crow laws, they wanna reinforce them all
Cause they all walkin' tall like V-A-N-S Off The Wall
With a pocketful of bombs, watchin' out, ready to drop
Hittin' ground zero like the Viet Cong in Vietnam
And I’m the obstacle, blockin' my optical from the possible
Non-impossible to the optimal but improbable
Philosophical, anatomical, I’m unstoppable
And I’m on top, unstoppable not, until I'm a
Prodigal
Individual, comical mental hospital chronicles
Nostradamus the prophet, prophecies in chronological
Life’s no game, no lucid dream, or a vision
It's a physical, visual, grand design in position
Man designed this religion to defy what our limits
And the lies too persistent to align our existence
As the ending of life approaches closer every second
I don’t see life and death as separate, only intersected
Like birth and death are but one experience connected
And time is of the essence so we careful how we spendin' it
