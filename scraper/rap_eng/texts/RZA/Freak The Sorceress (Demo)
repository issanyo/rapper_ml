[Verse 1: RZA]
Yo, check me check me, come on girl and sex me
I'm ready, I'm ready oh boy I'm ready
Ha, everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule
Yo I met this girl by the name of Katrina
Sexy-ass ho from the heart of Medina
20 years old, tried to control me
Had an attitude like Alexis Colby
Yo I'm not Toby baby I'm no slave
Felt for big ass, took her back to the grave
(Did you wet her up?) Yo I killed the fucking twat
Chopped off her head left her dead in the parking lot

[Verse 2: Poetic]
Baby, Baby, baby please don't go
Broom Hilda, the womb killer
Wanted me to fill her with life cause I'm a thriller
She wasn't on the pill but still
Wanted me to drill her with no guard on my dills
Boom, booms how the hottie got a hole in her head
Cause I couldn't lay her in a mothafucking cemetery bed
Aahk, she had mad rot in her crotch
Leading niggas to the cemetery plot

[Verse 3: RZA]
Now that's a shame, Goddamn that's a shame
But fuck it, check it
Wicked ass ho bro by the name of Flojo
Tried to throw a mojo on my fucking dick
I was like yo baby chill with the spell
I'm coming straight the slum pits of hell
Don't give a fuck about a slut
Or the damn size of her butt, all I want is a nut
She was like he-ha listen here dear
You don't got no cash get yo ass out of here
What did I do? Yo I grabbed her, threw her ass on the floor
Stomped her out then I stabbed her

[Verse 4: Poetic]
Ooh, I had left her in the rain
Freak the sorceress she is insane
As she reports to her Gravedigga office
Crazy Rigor mortis covers her frame
Cause of the fact she was packed with the fat hips
Guys get attractive clans get active
Still a worried the risk she's committing murders
She could burn your epidermis like a fucking thermos

[Verse 5: Frukwan]
It was dark sort of pitch black
Opening the trees can make you sneeze word black
There she stood looking good in the mist
Her full-length hair was in a twist
Asked if I'm a Gravedigga
Machines start to trigger from her hourglass figure
Her form was faint from the next grave
To my surprise yo she arrived from the far side
In the Black Lagoon hmmm steamy
Said her last nigga was a genie
Said a few words then vanished
I ain't understand because I don't speak Spanish
Abra kadabra with the boom lickety-split
Yo I got the grave graveyard shift
Better believe it yo and believe that I could fuck my rough shit this season
She wore a cotton saffron short one arm
Back in the crypt yo honey had it going on
She was no joke I had to tell her get off me
For killin' me softly though she could control my fortress
I figured it out but my wrist was courseless
My ritual hits you wickedest mix you Rah!
I got the report come on let me get you!
Freak the Sorceress, Freak the Sorceress, Freak the Sorceress
