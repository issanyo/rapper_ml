The ol' abbot 'n shit, y'knahmean?
You gotta sit still, after a while, knahmsayin?
But as long as he keep the fire burnin
Any spark, he can he can touch another fire
He can spark another person, another person
That's why you see in the kung-fu flicks
You see the abbot, you know
That he don't come back to fight the villain
He get a student, he train a student for that job
