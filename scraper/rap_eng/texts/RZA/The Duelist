[Intro: Remedy]
The Duelist..
Fetch your blade, swing your shit
The Duelist.. chop 'em

[Remedy]
I be the dope in this, great white hope in this
Soloist, vocalist, doloist, mogulist, long pole bogulist
Ragin' bull chauvinist, pull the wool specialist
Six million megabits, lyrical perfectionist
Fuckin' you, look into the tape and see the W
What to do? Times of rosen, who? Cold chosen few
Rap is void, make a move; stay paranoid
Velocity asteroid, royal can boy
You can't touch these, my family is crowned trustees
We got the half Swingin' Swordsmen
Wu Killa Beez, the truest, Art of War rap cats
Here are the rulers, Shaolin
This is Remedy, you can't fuck with The Duelist

[Chorus 2X: Remedy]
The dope in this, great white hope in this
Soloist, vocalist, doloist, mogulist, long pole bogulist
Ragin' bull chauvinist, pull the wool specialist
Six million megabits, lyrical perfectionist

[Remedy]
What you don't know is what you can't see
Me, Remedy, back in Dukes makin' cookies
Back in '93, chemistry, the dueler
Past-time hobby, rock the ruler
Now I mate you in the yard of the high price darts
Your last breath, one left, closer to death
Swingin' Swords, chop the head, pass it off to the next
Smokin' bones with Sunn, run off of one good lung
Of the murders, tracks that they've done, where I'm from
The Shaolin where anyone knows everything about everyone
It's scary, cut their tongue, shit's hairy, stay weary
I'm the so-called wings of God, they wanna glance
And lock you and got you in a trance to rock you
Off the seeds that they planted, don't take shit for granted
These fake fucks are makin' out like bandits
I seen it comin' through years of the plannin'
The man's got the knowledge, W, wisdom and the youth of understandin'

[Chorus 2X]

[Remedy]
Cut their tongues off, swing your blade
The Duelist.. Rem-D, chop 'em
