Let's build by destroying this weak shit
I bet you think that's Hip Hop, nigga that's weak shit
What's up with the flip flops, nigga that's weak shit
At least throw on some damn socks, looking at them shits
Got you on your toes ha, don't overstep your bounds
Especially in those, you are walking on deadly grounds
Not hot coals, here you get hit with rounds
Like fuck your clothes, look at them bunch of clowns
We fuck your hoes
You marry them, wife 'em up
We enlighten them and occasionally tighten them up
We Hip Hop villains, the bad guys you root for
If the government don't kill them, load your gun and shoot for them
B9 need a broad like Bonnie
Someone to hold me down and can work the Tommy, call me
I'm laid back like beach chairs and mix drinks
Feet up check out my Nike Airs

[Beretta 9]
What I call this here is lyrics, the flow the spirits
The beat loud the clarity, I'm sure you'll hear it
The word play delivery, wWatch how tear it apart
You will remember me on account, How I shoot this dart
Ride the track as if I'm loco, My motive be
Is show niggas that I'm no ho, In fact a G
Yup, This here's solo as in lp
Came through and smashed it solo, no help for me
Thought it appears I'm asleep, I'm not I'm chilling
Thought very much in my thoughts, just my feelings
Feeling the highs, feeling the lows
Feeling vibe, just feeling the flow
Taking a ride with no where to go
Just be ghost be gone, Just coast till we approach the dawn
We getting close till we exit
About to exit onto the nest route and just keep pressing on
Hit cruise control to where no blues patrol
No worries but who's to know, let's just go

[Rugged Monk]
The villain is back dress to kill in all black
Rugged Monk is his name and I'm ready for combat
Whether rap, scrapping, or jacking, I always keep it cracking
Spit flows that's consistent, pure satisfaction
For your eardrum show you how the west was won
Got a fully loaded notebook and my tongue's the gun
Spit like an AK, Come from Compton Cee-A-
L-I-F-O-R-N-I-A

[Rugged Monk]
Gunplay around my way, police harrass you everyday
If you ain't seen no yellow tape, that's a good day
Serve Sucka's on the mic, with my Rugged wordplay
Vivid pictures description show you swordplay
