[Verse 1]
I’m venomous give me the pen and I’ma put and end to this
Reverse genesis, consider me your nemesis
Intelligent degenerate, your viewpoint is irrelevant
Only write raps ‘cause I’m to broke to see a therapist
I go so fucking far with this, burn rappers like an arsonist
I bar so quick that I just buy the bottle and neck all of it
Don’t see this as a tournament, not tall enough to floor us kid
Instead I raise the roof until it falls and crushes all of you’s
Talk about your religion, I’ll talk about my position
Listen sitting wishing bitching won't get you a different pot to piss in
I want to witness winning grinning at the life I’m living
Mediocrity and conformity wasn’t the mission I was given
Slow it down son, save it for the album
Procrastinate at this rate and it will never come out man
You got a hell of handful trying to clear all those samples
With no capital capitalism prevails is set a the default outcome

[Hook]
Pygmy’s throwing spears at the elephant, dismissed as irrelevant
Thick skin don’t worry about little men
Until all the tribes unite and there’s an army of them
There’s nothing as powerful as an idea whose time has come
And maybe it will be like that for blading
So we can take this shit up from the pavement
And wind up in skyscrapers
Maybe it will be like that for blading
So we can take this shit up from the pavement

[Verse 2]
I’m on that hi-tech shit straight sci-fi flick
Kung Fu killer ninja flying roundhouse kick
Ready to die samurai given my life paying the price
In debt and stressed and wrecked so I’ve got to step to the test every night
I’m just saying I’m chill like I ain't even playing
When I rip the spot the best will drop to their knees and worship me praying
Only if I put the work in I know that much for certain
You have got to give love before you see it start returning
That’s the way that it goes so you can catch me rocking shows
When I play I play for keeps and the dice is getting rolled
Man I’m done with laying low had it with you saying so
Manic rampant frantic antics thanking satanic heroes
I walk with Hitchens in the booth I only care about the truth
Dawkins is the doorman Darwinism’s getting loose
Degrasse Tyson on the telescope cox cotching on the roof
This is the end of ignorant arrogant obnoxious views

[Hook]
Pygmy’s throwing spears at the elephant dismissed as irrelevant
Thick skin don’t worry about little men
Until all the tribes unite and there’s an army of them
There’s nothing as powerful as an idea whose time has come
And maybe it will be like that for blading
So we can take this shit up from the pavement
And wind up in skyscrapers
Maybe it will be like that for blading
So we can take this shit up from the pavement

Peace
