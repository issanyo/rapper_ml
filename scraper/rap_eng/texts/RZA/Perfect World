[Verse One: Alex Fitts]
Today I told a lie that's worth believing
Today I'll just be happy for no reason
I'm still waiting on the perfect drug
I feel really, I feel really numb

[Hook: Alex Fitts]
Hello to the drink that gives me wings
Where I have shoulders, we go so good together
Call mom and tell her I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love, I've fallen in love

[Verse Two: Alex Fitts]
Today I found a lie that's worth telling
Today I'll just act pissed off for no reason
I'm still waiting on the perfect drug
I feel really, I feel really numb

[Hook]

[Verse Three: RZA]
A perfect day and a perfect way to spend it
With a perfect bag of Ashton Kush, perfectly blend this
A perfect moment and a perfect way to own it
Is with a perfect cold bottle of Beroda, perfect zone kid
On the beach with a perfect female freak and a perfect physique
Perfect breasts and perfect butt cheeks, a perfect ten
I would perfectly tenant, yeah uh
The best friend in the sheets, a perfect ending
