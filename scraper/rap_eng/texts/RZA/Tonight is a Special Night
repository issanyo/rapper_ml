Ahhhhh
Throw your hands in the air
Tonight is a special night
Throw your hands in the air
Tonight is a special night
Gate
Throw your hands in the air
Tonight is a special night
Check me out, yo
Throw your hands high in the air
Tonight is a special night
Gatekeeper

(Gatekeeper)
There are reasons, and for most effects
And those that who get caught in the act get the axe
Yet, my style is known to catapult
Like a jet, like a F-15, yo
My gleem is bright and hard when it strikes
Niggas get caught in the dare of the nightmare
Ahhhh, your scared back away
Don't get to close or you just might get roast, ghost
Ha! I come with the tharow, the sparrow, the crow
Just like an arrow in the bow
Ha, I piss through your toe, your knee and your cap
Ooh, decapitate then scatter-rat
Ooh, and battle-rap thieves and villians
Those who ain't killin, thats theres the willin
Lord thats the way that they choose
Or you are bound to lose

(Rzarector)
Throw your hands in the air (yes)
Tonight is a special night
Throw your hands in the air (yes)
Tonight is a special night (yes)
I said
Throw your hands in the air (yes yes yes)
Tonight (tonight) is a special night
Woah, your hands in the air
Tonight is a special night

(Grymreaper)
Well it's the Grym-Reaper gets
A heap of fools I keep all low and meager
Profile, that show my style
Hopes, smile proposal wild, slow escapade
They wanna get paid after the show
Away we go to the motel, oh swell
Look my jimmy is so swelled up it's steamin
And the girls that been schemin
Gunna get the cream, when uhh
When I say I'm comming in the house
Hahaha, I'm comming in the house, no doubt

(Rzarector)
Throw your hands in the air
Tonight is a special night
Throw your hands up in the air
Tonight is a special night (tonight is a special night)
Throw your hands high in the air
Tonight is a special night
I said throw your hands up up up in the air
Tonight is a special night

(Tricky)
Hmmm ha, lets record it, ya
Hmmm ha, lets record it
This is... Is it recording?
I dunno how I feel
Do you know how you feel?
Are you yourself?
Are you someone else? (someone else?)
Cuz I'm me, haha
I'm me, ya ya
(RZA) Drop your trees(?)
I don't have to pretend
I don't need a friend
I don't need a wacker(?)
It's a rack up of pieces
Do you really belive?
Or do you decieve?
Let's record
(RZA) Throw your hands up high in the air
Let's record
Is it the real one, the funky real one?
Is it the real one, the funky real one?
Is it the real one, the real funky real one?
Are you the real one, the real funky real one?
