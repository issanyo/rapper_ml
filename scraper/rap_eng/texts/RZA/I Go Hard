[Hook]
And they think they know you
Till one day they show you
So no matter what they say I go hard
And they think it’s over, but it’s never over
’cause soon as you think I’m down I go hard

[Wiz Khalifa]
Get up it’s that bitch card, been here before
But don’t ever let them see you on the ground
Dues, what you gotta pay, and people see you gotta say
So don’t ever let them see you on the ground

[Hook]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yeah ya’ll, hey ya’ll
Dangerous thoughts mind of a militia
Bottles of the one fifty poured over twisters
Broken bones the pillars, Staten Island’s the illest
The biggest land fillers we creep like caterpillars
Love razors, dirty guns with a few bodies
Teach niggas how to walk again from the fucking shotty
Sixth sense, six pack, six degrees of separation
My evil third eye blinks with no hesitation
Dust bags, spoonfuls of sugar help the medi
Go down smooth and steady blowin' the green deadly
And weed pops isolator of hash bricks
Needle left stuck in his arm, died of a bad fix
We still rock, still dry drawers on the stove
Got bread from back in the days that’s growing some more
2Pac’s back, my Glock’s fat
After the guns smoke you’re screaming ‘where my block at?’

[Hook]

[Boy Jones]
I go hard like Listerine on bacteria
Hulk so hard he got the power to avenger her
I go hard, herbal tea, kidney cleanser
I go hard LA Dwight Howard
Lungs pounding hard too much smoke in the chimney
Fire plus iron evaporates the enemy
Jason Statham mechanic all mechanically
Right about now I can really use some Hennessy
I go hard like you never thought I could
One swing with the hammer the nails in the wood
My iron fist is so ridiculous
Forever, continuous, venomous and dangerous

[Hook]
