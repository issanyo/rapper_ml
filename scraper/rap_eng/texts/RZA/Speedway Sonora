[Verse 1: RZA]
I shot the wolf with a silver bullet
He didn’t think that I would pull it
Tryna block the path I was headed
I’m tryna get back on my good foot
Name scratched in the back of the good book
Shit lil nigga, that’s a good look
Black hooded, 40 acres of land developed
40 acres wooded
So much gold we don’t know where to put it
Follow the rainbow a pot to cook with
I called Paul to bank it
Forty tails up at the banquet
Plus he had Snow White blanket
All they talked was body language
The prince and the pauper, they both got vanquished
Time and time we causin’ damage

[Chorus: Paul Banks]
Speedway Sonora
It’s just somewhere to fly it’s just a sky like
All these rays
Somewhere way up high on the sight lines
The dawn brings
All the way
Every day

[Verse 2: RZA]
Yo I paved the path many warriors walk on
Black hawk, my prey gets stalked on
Lightning bolt strikes your horizon
Deep in the woods spend time with the wise men
Sight beyond sight my chi, energy it keeps on rising

[Pre-Chrous: RZA?]
Bob the huntsman sip tiger bone  (hahaha)
Bob the huntsman sip tiger bone
Bob the huntsman sip tiger bone  (hahaha)

It’s just somewhere to fly it’s just a sky like
All these rays somewhere way up high
All the sightlines the dawn brings
All the way
We say it’s alright I wonder where you hide
Across the sky no boundaries
Babe it’s just a rare July
Summer's wide eye
Dawns on the year
All the way
Everyday

Speedways Sonora
It’s just somewhere to fly across the sky like found dream state
I wonder where you hide
There's always bright light surrounding
All the way

It’s just a sky like
All these rays somewhere way up high
There's always bright lights shining upon the
