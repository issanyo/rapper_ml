Brooklyn, and we don't quit
It’s like this yo, and we don’t stop
Jay-Z, Rock Jockey, check it:
I get deep and dark like ditches
But when I rap, I come off
Like death without the glitches
Never crossed the black cat
With the riches, I’m leaving
Stevie, saying "no Wonder you’re superstitious"
Beef, I’m with it, simple
Ya’ll can all get it..
Ya’ll don’t all get it
Don’t nobody of mind for this matter
Can gather the data
Until your mind don’t matter
I bubble like lather
Hustle like the lead-off batter
Cause all that matters is the money
Til it ain’t funny, you feel me?
When the beast screams "kill me"
Don’t jerk me boy, I rip it silly
I’ll let you rise, of course
But if you don’t fall off on your own
MC's, I cut off at the knees like shorts
It gets worse - if you don’t care
For my sick thoughts like a nurse
With no known remedy
I’m leaving boys and men
On "bended knee" til "the end of the road"
I lie low, forget this record shit, with one sale

Yo, pardon me..

Check it out:
The nerve of these herbs
Ya’ll know who swerve
From the curb in the LEX
The best observe
I’m splashing, splurging
Dashing, that’s my word, you know?
Champagne glass is crashing, can’t ration
Used to having a whole lot
So dough - I blow a lot
Had a buck fifty while
You were still taking Skippy to school
Ran with one of them cats
That hides Tiffany’s for them jewels
Back when Duke was jumping
Out of cabs in Krush Groove
I was scheming and plotting mostly
Dreaming alive, but look what it got me..
Four cars and four hundred thousand shots later
You know what I mean?

Trying not to curse, you know?
Trying not to curse up in this piece..
