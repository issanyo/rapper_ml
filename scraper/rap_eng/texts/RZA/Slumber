[Verse 1: Mikey]
Bobby taught me my perception is unlimited
Infinite hieroglyphs to fortify my pyramids
My sympathy goes to simpletons tryna' sunder me
Slumbering/on me eyes closed Stevie wondering
Sunning these beats like god almighty and i'm
Pale whitey but the cops don't like me
And I might be/your favorite rapper Mikey
Who shows up laughing 'cuz he's stack a brick of the oG
You know me/you knew me
But the new me get zooted till I prove that I'm as useless
As the dudes that's around me
Can't found me confound me confuse me Confucius my music
Or lose it
My knowledge astounding
Vow that my vowels are constant expansion
I spit a solvent to solve conflict Iran
My family tree is as deep as the weeds
My dude bobby hold it down in DC
My dude Brett crazy with the hammer
Chillin' in Savannah spittin' grammar
Puffin on a gram of that gamma
Getting dollars in our pockets heavy wallets
Sadbox
Never stoppin' always get it get it
We all got problems with thee women 'cuz they wicked
Never half-hearted with these lines that are written
Call my works the cold Koran
The hot bible with no rival
My holy testament is evident to my childs
My destiny in enmity between me and the bottom
So I'm sipping out the bottle and my Chevy lookin' like a grotto
Colorado
Boulderdash pass the blunt ash it first you know what

What??

[Verse 2: Mikey]
I'm not sure of that
But now I'm back with a little bit more of that
And if you think I'm done you thought wrong your dumb
I come from the the heavens with deadly weapons
To preach the gospel that you're not full
Your life is awful and the only way to attain life is to follow
Me on my path to inner peace at least then your reasons will make sense to me
Since the only reason you exist is me
Thinking I need friends to exist with me
Thinking this the end of the song for mike
Dropped mike songs over more doses of dozier goodnight
