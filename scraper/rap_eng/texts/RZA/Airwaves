[Intro: Samples + RZA]
"We interrupt this program to bring youâ€”"
Chicka-poish! This, this is, is a, a, a, a Wu, Wu-Tang, Tang Killa, Killa Bee, Bee (Exclusive) blast, blast, blast, blast
Wake up, wake up, wake up

[Hook: Sample]
"Wu-tang! Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-tang! Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-tang! Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-tang! Wu-Tang!"

[Verse: Bobby Digital]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tales
MCs get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill
Is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist piercing holes in you
You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts
Blast through your box, walk with alarm clocks
Cars driving slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops his trunk
Snares pops loud as Glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in ya face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Love our queue got you drunk, you request the Wu
Flying monks fatal darts in your airwaves, strike ya antenna
You feel the bass shimmer
It makes your light get dimmer
Before you turn your dial from this
You best to slit your wrists
Through the soul of your heart like Don Cornelius
Unfamiliar, leave no trace like Simon Templer
Rhyme emperor, styles switch daily like temperature
In your atmosphere the rap racketeer
Six pack battery back, keeps 'em stacked
I live for hip-hop
And tall brown skin sugar plum who love the lollipops
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

[Hook: Sample]
"Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang!"
