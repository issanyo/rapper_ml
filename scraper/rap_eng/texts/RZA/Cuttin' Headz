[Verse 1: Ol’ Dirty Bastard & RZA]
Here it is. Where’s it at? In the back. Got a stack
The Dirty Bastard. Yo, you Bastard flip the phat track
Here I go, here I go, whether friend whether foe
Let them know that I flow over the rainbow
Hit the deck. Aw, yep, *ch-ch plow* from the Tek
Takin’ heads, takin’ necks. What the fuck they expect?
I don’t know! I don’t care! I won’t fall! I won’t stare
At a ho, ’less I know that I’m going to the mo-
T-t-tel, ’cause I’m lousy, my technique is drowsy
Stop tryin’ to foul me, sayin’ that we're lousy
But I’m a tyrant, defiant, walkin’ New York Giant
President of the Wu, but I’m also a client
It’s the Wu, what, you knew what, you do what, what, who, what, what
I don’t give a flying fuck about a chump
Cause his heart only pumps Kool-Aid
Snatch a kid by the braids, and cut his head off

[Verse 2: Ol’ Dirty Bastard & RZA]
Rhymes is rugged like burnt buildings in Harlem
The Ol’ Dirty Bastard from the Temple of Shaolin
Dirty to the brain like drops of acid rain
Clang, clang, clang, rhymes pluckin’ at your brain
So take a sip from the cup of death
And when you’re shaking my right hand, I’ll stab you with the left
*Whirr, whirr, whirrr!* Red alert, red alert!
Ason comin’ straight from the dirt
Once I go berzerk, mad brothers got hurt
Nuthin’ new in ninety-two, it’s time to go to work
Trills, watch them scream once I hop on the scene
They fear the return of the fatal flying guillotine
Mr. Milli, that means I’m also militant
Don’t wear no suit and tie, I’m no gentleman
Gettin’ laid, takin’ heads, that’s my hobby
Punch a brother in the face who call me Robbie
I be the RZA, call me that cuz-I
Never liked the name I received from my poppa
Dirty deluxe, yo, I’m huntin’ for ducks
Snatchin’ devils up by the hair, then cut his head off
