Aiyo, raise 'em up, hold ya cup
Up, let the Alize fill them up
Thug passion, love passion, niggas, who be actin'
Grey Goose, cranberry juice
Absolut, for those who can't afford the Goose
Malibu, coconut rum, Amaretto sour, coke & rum
We gettin' drunk, Hennessey, V.S.O.P
Age in the barrel, thirty-three years
My girl's been limin' it biz, ya'll niggas sniff lines in the stairs
German beers, Heineken, Beck's, Bud for you rednecks (yee-hah!)
Milwaukee's best, for those who only got two dollars and a bag of cess

[Hook 4X: RZA]
All we wanna do is drink, smoke and fuck (fuck!)

[RZA]
Chronic, blubonic, chocolate Thai stick, you want it
Jamaican green, silver haze, the Northern Lights get ya ass in a daze
Purple hydro, Indonesian skunks, you can tell by the funk
All we need is Fonzo' leaf or a blunt
Ez-Wider, Bamb√∫, I prefer the Dutch
Split the back open, then the weed get crushed
Bic lighter gettin' sparked, we procede to puff

[Hook 2X]

[RZA]
Here's to good friends, tonight is kinda special
The beer we brought, must be something wrong, somehow
Muthafuck the low and brow
Or the Rolling Rock, nigga, cuz I'm sippin' Cristal
Dom P., folski, yeah, Juliet, ice cold P
Peter Pipers, nigga, take a sip
Sit back, muthafucka or I'll bust ya lip

[Hook 4X]

[RZA]
There's Tanya, there's Sandra
Oh shit, there goes my cousin's baby's mamma
Big ass Nicole with no soul
Who would fuck a muthafucka for a jellyroll (jellyroll?)
I see Tasha, Pam and Sasha
Her cousin Tawanna, she's hairy like Chewbacca
Always trynna smoke on that chewbacca
Suck a dick dry for two shots of that Vodka
There's Shasha, BeBe and CeCe
Dede and Deiji, TiTi and FiFi
FayFay and BayBay, KatKat and FayBay
KayKay and Friday, they live for the payday
To drink, smoke and fuck

[Hook 4X]

Fuck! (8X)
