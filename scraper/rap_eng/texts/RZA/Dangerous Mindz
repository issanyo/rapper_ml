[Verse 1: Poetic]
I got stress on my brain, it causes chest pains
Inside the best frames
Ghetto blood clots is scored by slug shots, and drug spots
Well if you're too poor to move out or get a new house
It's like living in a war walking through shootouts
And you doubt God exists
When hard fists be pounding on your head like jackhammers
You're trapped in the black drama
You hear the laughter seconds after that you fade out
You're played out, you're laid out, your heart nearly gave out
You're lucky that you made out
With just a few scars when the bleeding ends
The streets [*sniff*] let ya breathe again
But evil men, will soon be on the receiving end
Of Universal Law, I'm calling on the meek and the poor
To fight back and never forfeit the day you have to go to war
With forces that are armed upon the seven continental borders
A mental fortress is essentials to absorb this
My sword hits the human orb until it orbits
In the 'Art of War', kids see Grym Reap be morbid
Since pieces of the lost civilization in the past
Had my photographs etched inside of pyramids
To laugh at this revelation, without 365 days of concentration
And twenty-four hour meditation, would be foolishly pagan
I'm ancient as 'amen', see I stay Grym
Throwing fools in in a pit full of pit bulls to be shaken
Or strapped to the crossroads of Hell and inner sin
Which trap the sinners in, to cell such in Sing-Sing
I bring Grym tidings, tidal your wave are not exciting
Stop riding the dick, start writing your own shit
Cause I stick figures that think they fat and can't rap wind blast
I make 'em Slim Fast, looking like stick figures
I'm all that, I bag chips at concerts and shows
Get more panties than hoes that boost Victoria Secret clothes
Foes is tagged like ex-foes toes at the coroner's
Kids with cold feet rise and fall like the barometer
Grym will mentally chop your career
See shit is locked down here, like penitentiary blocks and tiers
Escape outta your ducts every time you hear my name
You better duck fate or catch a fucking face full of duct tape
You get smacked like a trick that sniffed off her money
Then smoked like Rzarector with the blunts dipped in honey

[Verse 2: RZA]
Rotate your head like a gyro, my hair grows in knotty spirals
Feet resembles Christ's description from the Bible
Water-walker, immune to all physical torture
Pull out fast in a Porsche, upon a double-crosser
My penis rise up in the morning like a Phoenix
And blast iron cell into a low blood anemic
The imperial material's venereal
MCs get murdered in serial, you can't fuck with the material
Unorthodox paradox, my shit is seen widescreen Magnavox
Grabs thought like Doctor Octopus
Cause war like the grandson of Kush
I'm hanging devils' heads on a evergreen bush
Sugar-frosted sorceresses bitches get exhausted
Pussy lips be dripping, like leaky faucets
Undercover C-Cyphers sprayed up like windshield wipers
While I'm guzzling Pipers, changing my son's shitty-ass diapers
Dime piece trapped in sync like MIDI time piece
You get stampeded by the wildebeest
A rap DATs, bust tracks back like Chow Yun Fat
Oppositional forces get their eardrums flat
Common denominator, I swing the mic saber like Vader
You was fooled by the orientation made from a traitor
MCs get their wigs blown, trounced off both fist bone
Choked from my death, every time they break a wishbone
Eventually, I knew the whole world would mention me
Potentially, I have the Chi to make G's
MCs breeze on my tracks, I rock the fruit with the trees
Killa Beez spread rapid like diseases
See it's like the second coming of Jesus of Nazareth
Be fabulous, raise the dead crowd up like Lazarus
Hazardous vocabulary attacks be beautiful
Acoustical notes we provoke, it comes out musically dope
Niggas realize they just can't cope
The hair busting out the head resembles fire and smoke, Loc

[Verse 3: Frukwan]
I blast watts in circuits like General Monk-Monk was Turkish
My science is divided deep into your central nervous
Pervert area codes peep this murder
I'm boxed-in, sucking hologram tits, inhaling oxygen
Parallel world of crab niggas and seashells mix
I pierce my dick and sword right through you pelvics
I'm hell stricken bomb, wrapped in trees of palm
Physical existence is descendants of Allah
I travel at high rates, weaker men are primates
That either migrate or get burnt to the stake
I feed off lyrical light beams of amphetamine
My terminology is panatomic like lobotomy
Crazy el loco, gas niggas like Sunoco
Flush 'em like Presto, blast in your chest bone
I raise from the shore like Sodom and Gomorrah
With traction, flashing a 4-wheel drive Ford Explorer
While mucus lies within the center of the Rubik's
The roots of the wine induced the enzymes inside your nucleus
Turmoil boiling appointed, niggas rubbing off my style like an ointment
Lost in the Sahara from trial and error
Confused with 3 Mules for Sister Sara
Rahh! Bearer, digesting minerals in abundance
Because the dead is not known to return from the dungeons
