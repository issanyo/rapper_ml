[Chorus: Dionna Nichelle]
Silly little girl, in a men's world, wish I could fly
Dilly lilly pearl, caught up in a twirl, of a butterfly
Ladadadadi, ladadadada, wish I could fly
Silly little girl, caught up in this world, of lullaby

[Rah Digga]
See when the, mics go on, the lights go on
It's like Muhammad Ali, and Tyson sparring
I take a, stab at you, a jab at you
I do 'em, Carrey style, I make 'em laught at you
Try me, ain't nothing worse than a little defeat
From trying to weak a sleeping giant that ain't even asleep
I'm not your ordinary shorty, I be bobbing and weaving
Don't even give me no excuses, just to knock a few teeth in
Bust a shot like it's semen, you do not want to see it
Have you in predicaments, you do not wanna be in
The last man to try, the last man to die
Wiggle my toes, then turn to the last samurai
Move, who not to scare to die, we runnin' wit our spears
To the sky, screaming Bis Mi Allah
So please be advised, cuz she's gonna light up the trails
Better listen to them old wise tales

[Chorus]

[Rah Digga]
Without warning, shit could get real appaling
And invalid, don't even know what to call it
S.I.O., or you could call me bad business
Talking eyes, while your boys in the hood, down to menace
The skull smasher, basher, chicken head mangler
Then use you as a tool for my misplaced anger
The dude ripper, cuz they don't even see me come out
I blind side 'em, 'fore they can even get they guns out
Now who next to try, who next to die
What you call fighting for your life, I call exercise
Huh, coming through, looking like Lucy Liu
Whipping shanks out, running down the block, WHOODI-WHO
Ooh, you acting all intusive, we rolling kinda deep
Up in this piece, now don't be foolish
Don't make a sister lose it, that would not be condusive
But wouldn't be the first time people die, for something stupid, stupid

[Chorus]

[Outro: Rah Digga]
Here we go, baby, it's Dirty Harriet
Digga digga ya'll
