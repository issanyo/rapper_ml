[Hook: Bobby Digital]
From the heart of Medina to the head of Fort Greene
Now Why See everything
Niggas who sling, Shaolin cats thrown inside of bing
Bobby Digital got the golden seal sting

[Verse 1: Bobby Digital]
Rhyme star, I write a hundred thousand dollar bar
My ten strike combo deletes your power bar
Dr. Octopus tentacle, sing a simple song
Bob Digital instrumental, nothing's identical you biter
Non-writer, Mr. Potato Head, Ore-Ida deep-fried crinkle cut
One single cut fucks your whole LP up
You must be stupid you liar, I'm the purifier, live wire
Hip Hop reviver, a suicide mission you're committing
Go against the Wu-Tang henchmen
Perfect precision marksman, spit darts and rip charts and
Archery, shots aimed at your heart and
Daffy duck us, we still bring the motherfucking ruckus
Project Killa Hill be the buckest
Smoke blunts drink Bud Light beer with Buzz Lightyear
Went from here to infinity but I'm right here
Bobby Digital, overthrow your whole citadel
Mister Pitiful, your whole rap stack is despicable
Undernourished, your shit cannot flourish
Cherish every moment of this love before you perish
Bitch - ka-chich ka-chich - watch me switch
Looking for a bird I can hitch
Enter your atmosphere, dig your pussy out like a pap smear
Make you smile, at the same time crack a tear, smack your rear
Vagina saliva, Trojan wear, rough rider
Up inside ya, dick applehead opens up your clit wider
Taste the apple cider, you become strong, then become a bride of
(Bobby Bobby Bobby, Digi Digi Digi)
Stuck to your ass like a Victoria's Secret wedgie

[Hook x2]
(replace "golden seal sting" with "killa bee sting")

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Drink a Heineken, as we go inside the mind again
Never minding men, dropping gem, can he shine again
Most definite, let this be my last will and testament
For the pessimist, exercise for the Exorcist
Johnny Treacherous, like Three
I'm supposed to be perpetuous
Decimate the poetry and everything that's close to me
The lecherous, Jonathan
King of the seven seas, battle with Leviathan, the Methodist
Poly to your deficit, hit it up
If I can't live it up somebody gotta give it up
John J., blow em out the water Dr. Bombay
Your bitch look like Strange, rubbing me the wrong way
Burn one and saute, bringing you different ways of sword play
They busting bullets over Broadway, deep cover
I'm like Larry when the fish burn, I burn rubber
Cause I'm not an easy lover
Ten to midnight, butt naked with a knife
Ask my A-alikes, I've been crazy all my life
Hard time homicide, time fly, do or die
Crooked S and crooked I, scripture from the darkside
Johnny 5, I reside, in the killa bee hive
Only the strong gon' survive

[Outro: Method Man]
From the depths of the Killa to the top of Now Born
Wildin' on Staten Island be the poet John John
Can't forget Bobby, if I did I'd feel gyp
Like my sandwich ain't a sandwich without Miracle Whip
From the depths of the Killa to the top of Now Born
Wildin' on Staten Island be the poet John John
Can't forget Bobby, if I did I'd feel gyp
Like my sandwich ain't a sandwich without Miracle Whip
