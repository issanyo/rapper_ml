[Intro]
Yo, yo, yeah
Trafficante, Word up
Here to speak about, yo
Polluted Wisdom, yeah, 2nd Chamber, to all the boos
Polluted Wisdom, 2nd Chamber, yo

[Verse 1]
I know this chick named Gina drove a royal blue Beamer
Holding two chrome ninas fucking daily like Nadina
Wore corn braids, I used to hit it back in the days
Now she a coke slave, Italian niggas getting her pay
But that's her heritage, she stayed sniffed up, no sorrow
Clean her toes for today gave a fuck about tomorrow
But she borrowed 50 Gs flat from a shark
Now they trying to make the chick history like Noah's Ark
She blew the cheddar, she live on the low where it's better
Copped the condo, some jewels, and a '97 Jetta
Now she know she Big Will but wrong she Silly Sally
Think she handling armies 'cause her body out in Cali
Terribly mistaken strung on yay in its creation
Trying to slide down south with the cream from the Jamaicans
It's a woman hunt been on for 'bout 3 months
When they catch her some say they pouring gas in her cunt
Torch it like a blunt and sparked on the God born day
She wanted to be a queen but went about it all the wrong way
She still hanging in bars, being Diana Ross
Friday and Saturday jumping back and forth in niggas' cars
Now I see her with Ken at the bar guzzling gin
Thinking he the man 'cause he got a 500 Benz
He like it raw when he touch skin, Gina just a friend
Not knowing the type of lifestyle shorty was in
From Shaolin

[Break]
Word up, think again
Know what I'm saying? Word
To all the wisdoms, living a fast life
Yeah, you rather see the light
Pump your breaks, know what I'm saying?
Word up, it's reality, word up, yo

[Verse 2]
Driven by greed, she live in a plot with a knot
Been in the block with ten crisp Gs in her pock
She ain't stunting it, joint off safety, three clips
Peep the rear-view some dreads pulled back her whips
So she murked off they murked too it's drama again
Just bought a first-class ticket going to Michigan
She tried to come out alive grabbed the joint then sat aside
Thinking if she shoot first then her life can't be denied
Started blazing, shorty was no joke, she blinked
Using rapid fire, the dreads trying to hit her gas tank
Testing Uzis, ooh-wops, the next man block cock
Through the action four bystanders was shot
But it continued, shorty hitting ninety, scraped the Benz
Still steering, begging Allah for her sins
With no friends she had to handle beef on the dolo
Three shells came through the window one went through her Polo
Now she swerving needing a doctor like J Erving
Two other chickens that knew her, severe lesson they was learning
Sipping bourbon she reloaded seeing her life being demoted
Catch a flashback remember shit Scarface quoted
Still licking off shells, feeling the fires of hell
Losing mad blood trying to make it back to the hotel
Dreads licked off, attacked, she had no chance to react
Firing emptying clips from fifty-shot gats
Two more caught her in her back, the others made the tires flat
The car flipped thirteen times dun and that was that
That was that

[Outro]
Word up black
Yeah, yo, to all the women
Watch what you do and who you screw
Yeah, be a queen and not a money fiend
Know what I mean? Word up
Protect yourself La the Darkman / Rzarectah
