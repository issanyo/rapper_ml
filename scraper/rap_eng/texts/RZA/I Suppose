[Verse 1: Nixon]
I don't really see nothing new on the news, someone shot dead in the head but they don't got clues/
People just simply refuse, to cooperate with officials/
Everybody heard the shots but didn't see the pistol/
Probably two young black individuals/
Damn we get stereotyped so much, like if someone gets stabbed or shot, it's always us/
Always back of the bus, no rosa parks around no more/
King probably watching in heaven, ask what I died for?/
Probably grounded to the floor, I feel like nothing really changed/
Tubman on this track the way I getaway with trains/
200 years later and they still wearing chains, but now they're only gold/
Streets getting very cold, but they got heat/
Grab a seat, or be flat on your back, not lying/
Dimes are always dying, thoughts on top of your head?/
I guess she wasn't lying, she wasn't on top your bed? Lead could leave you dead, with nothing/
Thank God for every breath and pray for brighter days/
But not one of you are trying to fix your ways/
But trust me that tool won't even help you/
Stop trying to fix people's problems and just help yourself/
But some of y'all are just too caught up in trying to be somebody else/
But go ahead and live your life, just trying to drop a little advice/
So maybe you could go and live it right/
Really you should put down that reefer/
Your not perfect, but I never said i was either/
Probably packing a pistol but what are you gonna do?/
Because they don't even need to know your name anymore to kill you

[Bridge: Nixon]
Supposed to look like a fool
Supposed to do bad in school
Supposed to go to jail
Supposed to not get bail
Supposed to go and hit licks
Supposed to be statistics

[Verse 2: Nixon]
I kinda find it messed up how they keep claiming they'll stick up for there brothers/
But almost always end up kilingl each other/
Tired of hearing all of this trap raps/
From the same ones that ain't even about that/
Then I'm tired of these females with those pics on instagram you need to stop/
My mother told me to respect you boo, but honestly you don't even give me a reason to/
Maybe it's just me that doesn't want the cream/
My teachers don't even have dreams/
They just pass out papers evenly/
But then again maybe that's how this life made them/
So I can't really say it's there fault/
The tv screen has desensitized them to the point Where they used to hearing about rape, violence, and assault/
"Oh well" is probably what they say/
It just "happens everyday"/
But that's not my point as a whole/
I'm just hopping you don't become a victim, to these systems of control/

I suppose
