Double R

[Verse 1]
Roman Redwood will make a nigga flip like somersaults
Throw you in a Wonderwall. Wonder what you’ve done at all
This Oasis is hotter than summer balls
Coming up in So Cal, I don’t know where you from at all
Flip scripts, money ain’t what it seems
Everyday is sunny like Kid Cudi’s dreams
Don’t gotta Live in hollywood to get your tummy tucked
Fuck is up, puffing gummy funk when we crush it up
Roll it up tight like we was trying to wrap a mummy up
Got a lighter? Yup! Light her up, smoke a funny one
Burn it like the sunny sun, hit it ’til it’s doney-done
Getting honey stuck, then we go and hit your honey up
Step back before you go and get your bummy fucked
Never trust a crummy nun, blessed with that dummy luck
You didn’t get touched, running up like an undie run
About to take your money lunch, flip you over, sunny up
No commercials breaks, Roman Red is coming up
And I ain’t even twenty one
Got the Devil’s Sympathy, ‘cause I’m a Rolling Stone
Trolling? No. But I been owning blokes since I was only 4
Phoning home, hoping I could take ahold some forest blow
Got that Chuck Norris flow, hit you with a rope-a-dope
Groping hoes, elope and then we boldy go where you don’t go
Choking off the coke and blow, no man I’m joking though
Fuck a line, motherfucker I could hold the phone
Saying that I rock is like calling David Bowie old
I fuck with Bowie though, if you could only know
These Young Americans be thinking they can open doors
When they only smoking dro, going where the stoner’s go
Typing up my lyrics, it be best that you start bolding quotes
Suicide when I write, you know that I’m still coping though
I come around like the Rolie Polie Olie show
Never said it before
I got a habit for the Kravitz ‘cause I’m tryna get at Zoe, yo

Yeah I said it

[Verse 2]
Trying to make sure my story told
Life be giving lemons, I got Apples in my Stereo
Soundtrack by Karen O, Pokemon, Lucario
Headed to Nebraska like where Zooey and Jim Carrey go
Never getting married though
Very close, but she very pro when she carry loads
Always got Plan B, but it be scary though
Can’t make a baby if she on the top, where cherry’s go
I make the cherry blow, she be thinking “Where he go?”
Don’t even worry, I’ma come around like Merry-Go
That shit is very old, treat it like some dairy mold
I’ll be getting scary dough, rare as gold
*NSYNC with the skill, I be spitting with that choreo
Drink it with the milk, I be killing all the oreos
If I could flip the script, and never keep the story old
I'd make Topanga and Cory go on the Maury show
You are the Fahja!
