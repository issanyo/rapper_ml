[Intro]
Yeahhh
This is a story
That there are deep, situations, everybody go through in life
(It's something that we go through)
You know, it's that inside part of you that you don't tell nobody about
You know what I'm saying from that inside, that dark space inside you
(It's something that we go through)
From that darker, that inner side of you
It's from the dark side

[Verse 1: Fruitkwan/Gate Keeper]
Pow pow! No more knocks at your doors
It's just about to explode, hit the floor!
I come from a drip of blood shedding
Spreading, my heading, straight from Armageddeon
It's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Once you get slapped by the dark side
I was attacked, not clever to react
Small as a peep, I was deep in solar facts
My escapade level swelled
Threw up, fell
I grew up, five blocks from Hell
I'm used to seeing the grass grow black
Meddlers pushing peddlers kids that pushed cracks
Murderers leavin they traces
Ya wasted, permitted destroying the human races
Fuckit I'm bringin ruckus
To brothers an APB out on the next Fredrick Douglass
I'm sort of a saint, you think I ain't
With skills to paint, with my third eye
You're tranked...
...from the dark side

[Interlude: Prince Rakeem/Ryzarector]
We expressing feelings, we expressing our dark feelings
So my feelings may be deeper than his or his feelings may be deeper than mines
But it's all in the expressing of a feeling
(from the dark side)

[Chorus: Too Poetic/Grym Reaper]
You, are dumb, and deaf, and blind
You, are dumb, and deaf, and blind
You, are dumb, and deaf, and blind
You're dumb AND deaf AND blind

[Verse 2: Too Poetic/Grym Reaper]
In a time when every creature large and small shall fall
I'm using Revelations, as my crystal ball I see
More hordes of warlords who so hard they bogard
The graveyard terrain, scar tissues of brains
Beyond illuminating soon the Illuminati platoons
Of Satan lay waiting to slay men
Save your, amens, awaken
The reason that Grym is gone
I escape through your synagogues
And gave the Egyptians, ancient Inscriptions
Leaks into Christians, turn all the facts into fictions
Here comes the Reaper with a shock to your system
I chop religions that concoct the vision
Feel the incision of the sword that's piercing your third eye
Coming straight from the dark side
...from the dark side

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Gravediggaz...
...in the dark side
Coming to take you...
...from the dark side back to the light
...from the dark side
You're in the dark side (yeah)
We're in the dark side
You're in the dark side
We're in the dark side
You're in the dark side
They're in the dark side
We're all in the dark side

You're dumb and deaf and blind (it's something that we goin through)
(from the dark side)
You're dumb and deaf and blind
You're dumb and deaf and blind
In the dark side
Yeah, Gravediggaz
