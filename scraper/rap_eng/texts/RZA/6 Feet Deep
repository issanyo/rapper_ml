[Intro: Poetic]
Sup this is the Gravedigga jam session (add a little riff)
What's today's date? (Today's the 20th) (Friday)
The 20th of May, 1994
We chillin in GLC studios
And we gonna go like this
Got my man BB Frukwan (look at the riff)

Hook:
G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V
E-to-the-D-to-the-I-to-the-G
G-to-the-A-to-the-zig-zag-Z
Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet deep
(x2)

Verse One: Grymreaper
I floss my teeth on a gospel track
I'm not an apostle, but I bring the axe to ya back
I chew and attack
Like Crest on plaque
After that, your world is black
You drop into a hole
Your mold separates from your soul
Behold, the Gravediggaz told you 'Beware'
But you didn't listen
So now we appear eardrums glisten, ha ha

Hook

Verse Two: Gatekeeper
When I wreck I commence to detect
Ready to dissect so come step alive and die
Next murder is mayhem
Diggin graves is a regular
Treach-orous mangler
Tha Boston Strangler
Heated and trapped in a fury of hate
Daredevil, the rhyme rebel my art terminates
Subduin and pul-ver-i-zin ya head
You bled, fell dead, and your tomb-stone read
Rza-to-the-recta, Grym-to-the-reap
Unda-to-the-taker, Gate-to-the-keep
Creepin thru tha ghettos and the slums and streets
Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet

Verse Three: Rzarector
Darkness shall fall upon y'all
Who slept on the styles
That crept thru tha door
The grave, behave, we come to save
So don't be afraid of the dark
We spark like light in night
Excite, excite is right, is right
Come follow the light
And see what I see and be what I be
Tha G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V...E

Hook

Verse Four: Gatekeeper
In the mind I come with the sparks from the attic
Yet psychopathic brain tracks is tragic
Twist lifting wrist like riff of a Taurus
Deep in tha forest, I slay for tha porridge
Yet it's cold, ya die slow like a tortoise
Deep in my chorus, ya result Diggamortis
Let me see I'm castin disease
Contrary, yet some fairy cause ya bleed

Hook

Verse Five: Rzarector
Demonic, the sonnet is bangin like chronic
And niggas be audi faster than Sonic
Bubonic, plutonic ya best up on it
Beats bein programmed ASR Ensoniq
Styles compiled for miles and childs
Bodies in aisles and upside-down smiles
Reflect, catch wreck from sun-moon sect
Revenants shines light then thought reflects

Hook

Verse Six: Grymreaper
I came on the scene
In a wheel that Ezekiel seen
To exploit your flaws like Philistines
Look in the sky, oh my, it is I
No alibi, so don't even try to feed me swine
And Grymreaper's mind is so refined
I'm deep, I'm deep, I'm deep
As a hill or a cliff or a steep
Incline at the bottom of an ocean reef
