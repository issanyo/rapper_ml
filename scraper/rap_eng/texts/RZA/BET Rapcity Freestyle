[Intro: Big Tigger & RZA]
Yeah
Rap City Tha Bassment
(smack that, we gonna smack that...)
Rza!

[Verse 1: Big Tigger]
Big Tigger putting it down with common sense
His new album called "Birth of a Prince"
You gon' cop that, it's in the stores black
And don't act whack, or you'll get clapped back
It's Big Tigger and my man Rza-Resurrector
Putting it down, I'll be like the freestyle perfecter
Got my girl T-Losting from Boston
But we all Yankee fans and of course n'...

[Verse 2: RZA]
It's the Resurrector, yo I'm sipping off the golden nectar
I may chew you down like Hannibal Lecter
So respect to the Inspectah Deck'star
You know my check'sta, I'm microphone check
Might just wet you
I blink cataracts from 40 feet back
And I make rap beats over 43 tracks, yo
Who wear fleece, in a Gucci linen
I get drunk with the cops, I'm boning police women

[Verse 3: Big Tigger]
Yeah, you how me and my crew bang
We do things like Wu-Tang, so what'cha you wanna do
How you want it? - we gonna give it to you raw
And you can check us everyday, right here, live at 4
But tomorrow, no, you won't see me
Cause we airing the BET awards live at 3
Holla back now, it's Big Tig' doing it
With the freestyle, so come back now

[Verse 4: RZA]
It's Black Entertainment, yesterday I made my arrangement
And the judge: "you know I can't budge, because I'm thick like fudge"
The black ghetto Prince, leave no metal prints
I may push through your hood on a back of an elephant
Police escort, gat in my Jansport knapsack
Plus and I just left court
And I was late for my court date
Cause I was up all night boning strawberry shortcake

[Verse 5: Big Tigger]
Yes, we're keeping it critical
It's Big Tigger with my man the Rza AKA Bobby Digital
It's going down right now, putting it down for all Shaolin
And my peoples up town
My girl T-losting repping Boston, I said that before
But yes I'm still flossing
Rza come on, and shut it down
I'ma turn it to you over right now

[Verse 6: RZA]
Yo check I'm not senile, meanwhile it's back to the freestyle
You wanna get burnt, you get turned, like the turn-style
I'm not a burnt child, I gotta firm smile
I gotta glow makes the halls be like yo
Washers on the Wheels of Steel, Bobby Digital
Used to called Bobby Steels, Park Hill, Shaolin Island
BET - Black Entertainment TV, where you could see me:
Little past 3
For some it's channel 48 for some it's channel 24
I don't know it's up to you, whatever territory you're from
Just knock on the door, Wu killer bees son
Yo we're bringing it raw - you know how we do

[Big Tigger shouting]
Album in stores

[Outro: RZA]
Album in stores it's "The Birth of a Prince"
And there been no man born like this since 2000 BC
Y'all better be happy to see me, I'm like Christ
I'm like Godzilla coming over mountain Fiji
Ohh it's your boo, what's up mommy, hey I'm happy to be in TV
I'm just zoning out
