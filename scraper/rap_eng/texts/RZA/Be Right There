[Hook]
Just call me up I'll be right there
Money folding up I'll be right there
Wu throw it up I'll be right there
If the world blowing up I'll be right there
Nigga throw it up I'll be right there
Just call me up I'll be right there
Wu throw it up I'll be right there
I'll be right there, I'll be right there

[Verse 1]
Yeah, this is it yo the final chapter
Got'cha back nigga chiropractor
Fuck with my brother gonna have to clap with'cha
Mess with my brother going back to Attica
He the nucleus, I'm the reactor
Wolf scarred, battle star galactica
Solid gold, I'ma fold and package ya
Repzar nigga I'm a rhythm trafficker
Up against the wall, I'ma sandwich ya
All-star pro, you's a amateur
Damager, bandager, examiner, stamina
I love the fame, I love the props
I'm from the drug game, I hug the block
There's the stage, I'm ready to rock
Yo RZA hit me up when the mic gets hot

[Hook]

[Bridge] X2
Set it up, I tear it down
Wet it up, I shake the town
Place your bet, I'ma lay it down
Ready Set, I'ma take the crown

[Verse 2]
I got the respect when I hit the South
I'm the connect yo forget the drought
You cross me once, bitch you out
Now ask yourself what the grits about
I'ma chew you up, spit you out
You see this hard rock nigga, forget the doubt
Computer programmer, just click the mouse
I want fifty K hits nigga watch the bounce
Now to the ounce, I'm keying notes
Ya'll beating niggas, ya'll pumping soap
I'm eating niggas, I'm so cutthroat
Watch a one-armed nigga just cut the dope

[Hook]

[Bridge] X2

I'll be right there X8
