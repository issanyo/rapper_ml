[Intro: RZA (Blue Raspberry)]
Yo hold up stop stop
What's goin on, what's goin on
Yo what's goin on, what's goin on I'm just holdin on
(What's goin on what's goin on)
What's goin on, what's goin on
(What's goin on what's goin on)
What's goin on I'm just holdin on
(What's goin on I'm just holdin on)
What's goin on, what's goin on
(What's goin on what's goin on)
What's goin on I'm just holdin on
(What's goin on I'm just holdin on)

[Verse 1: RZA]
Yo, if you could soar the sky like a bird
Would you be disturbed to see brothers on the curb smoking herb
And cops from the third precinct rush in like a herd
Charge a delinquent with possession
Greets 'em then arrest 'em, strip, search 'em then undress 'em
Make the youngster come in and sign a confession
Or would you watch the cop in the chopper
With the high powered binocular cameras
Attached the bottom of his aircraft, takin photographs of your lab
Pointin a 50 millimetre 500 shot magazine full clip gat at your back
Hovering the projects, spotlight shining bright on moving targets
Infrared light at night on dark objects
Harassing citizens who hasn't been charged yet
Would you order a flock of pelicans to jam their propellers
On top see forfeit the death system failure
Take these devils off, eyewitness Tom Brokaw
Mentally fry his brain and blow the smoke off
Killa Bee, presidential suite, Bill and Hillary
Bow and kiss my feet, auxillary security retreat
Heavy artillary sun heat, meet the agony defeats the cavalry
Six-pack battery back, anti-gravity raps
Snaps your head inside the bear trap, you can't adapt to the habitat
The bigger jigsaw puzzle be the world map
Niggas think that they own things and man sit high upon thrones
When you die tell me what the fuck you own
When your skin flesh and bones find a permanent home
As food for worms or fossils trapped in stone

[Break: RZA (Blue Raspberry)]
What's goin on (What's goin on)
I'm just holdin on (What's goin on)
What's goin on (What's goin on)
I'm just holdin...

[Verse 2: Frukwan]
Airborne planes with ultra rays
Aerosol sprays leaving tracemarks, you're picked up on radar
Tracking your moments, political opponents
Everything you own, now he owns it
From the genesis exact off the tip
Undergoing metamorphosis through computers in your offices
A crystal construct a nuclear missile
Every fifth school we produce more pistols
Documented details, shocked at retails
Shipped to the ghetto for resale
Peep the calamitous dreams and destroy the thermometers
Dropping like niggas unemployed

[Break: Gatekeeper (Blue Raspberry)]
What's goin on, what's goin on (What's goin on)
Just holdin on, just holdin on (What's goin on)
What's goin on, what's goin on (What's goin on)
What's goin on, just holdin on (What's goin on)

[Verse 3: Poetic]
Yo triple 6 is established
The average savage cabbage is tryna live lavish
Off of the credit card balances
The magnetic strips that stick onto plastic
New World Order system of society that's cast us
Masses is mastered and broadcasters speak
The media breach and your optic forefathers
Topics is wild as fiction
To lessen the friction my children beware the pale rider
Your life is slipped into a microchip
I warned you with all of the mics that I grip
Cash days fade away devils roll hard
Trappin souls inside of Visa gold cards

[Verse 4: 9th Prince]
Yo this is cerebral warfare
Nuclear golden sphere attacks the hemisphere
Leaves the human fearness of the pit of urban tears
Dedicate my life to Allah, each bar's a star
Far from Mars, for vengeance my opponents die hard
Panasonic electronic thoughts cut short your life support
Half deceased enemies are buried alive at the Wu mount enterprise
Raisin cane remain pain in the brain, stain the mindframe
Slay like heroin bein shot in the veins
9th Prince the principle, I was born invincible
Slew with a tribute to my attribute
Weak lyricists in my cipher stay mute
My wisdom is sword justice
Chop off the head of those who can't be trusted
I'm signing off as I let my knowledge be born, sharp like a thorn
Bloods callin' themselves Gods, yo, what's goin' on?

[Outro: Blue Raspberry]
What's goooooiiiiiinnnn oooonnnnnn
What's goin on, what's goin on (8x)
