[Verse 1: Snoh Aalegra]
Faith like broken hearts
Warm like mothers arms
Holding me close in the dead of the dark
You're fake like false alarms

[Pre-Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
I've been holding on for way too long
I can feel the fever coming on
Oh

[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
So what if I'm emotional?
I feel it in my bitter bones
Oooh I need somebody to hold me
Oooh I need your body to tell me I'm the only one
Oh, can anybody help me now?
Cause I'm on on a high that's coming down
Ooh I need somebody to hold me
You don't need to tell me, I know that it's love, cause it hurts

[Verse 2: Snoh Aalegra]
Dress my open wounds
I'm not over you
I'm just a puppet you played for a fool
Your sex is my abuse

[Pre-Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
I've been holdin' on for way too long
But I can feel the fever coming on, oh Lord

[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
So what if I'm emotional?
I feel it in my bitter bones
Oooh I need somebody to hold me
Oooh I need your body to tell me I'm the only one
Oh, can anybody help me now?
Cause I'm on on a high that's coming down
Ooh I need somebody to hold me
You don't need to tell me, I know that it's love, cause it hurts

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Punch drunk, you abused and lovesick
Ass tattoos of the dudes you fuck with
Hand in your jeans too tight to walk right
Hopped in the Uber to party all night
Watch how you move cause you're movin' too crazy
Think I can shatter the hold on you, baby
Play too rough but the game too rough
And I won't hold grudges against if you play me
Shame on us, I'm the same old fuck
From my third grade lunch, passin' notes tryna be cool
Then you was fine cause your face and your mind
Now you pay you a fine and you with baby mama
Breakin' the bond, now the kids get the karma
Moon gray as your granny, night black as Obama
That's kinda, but not really
I'm just takin' what you're gon' give me

[Outro: Snoh Aalegra]
Baby please I need you darling
I’m bleeding darling
I know that it’s love
So what if I'm delusional?
Don't wanna face it any more, no no
Oooh I need somebody to hold me
You don't need to tell me, I know that it's love, cause it hurts
