[Intro: Rzarector, (Grym Reaper)]
Aiyyo Reaper, those kids out there say you're mad thirsty
You got somethin for them to drink?
(Yo we can wet up two cups of blood)..

[Verse One: The RZArector]
Arm to the leg, leg, arm to the head! Yo
Be the Rzarector, resurrect the mental dead

[Verse Two: The Grym Reaper]
G to the R to the Y M Reaper
As I get deeper than a crypt, resurrect, kid!

[Verse Three: The RZArector]
Don't go against the grain, mad slang is my thang
I leave the hearty party with a bang buzza
Boom! Check my tune, it gotcha' hyper
Don't give a fuck about a sucker C-cipher!

[Verse Four: The Grym Reaper]
As you decipher the tricks of a viper
Swine is lethal! ... is evil!
I am original, we can build upon
The ill form, and keep all your brain cells warm

[Verse Five: The RZArector]
Hocus pocus, yo! What's the focus?
Weak techniques you speak, the shit is bogus

[Verse Six: The Grym Reaper]
Even in a mortuary, science will bloom
As I seek the knowl' from the womb to the tomb

[Verse Seven: The RZArector]
Yo! Deadly, deadly, HYAH! Get ready
Here come the styler, wilder than Freddy (dead)
Cause a Krueger, boom, I do ya
Just to let ya know Gravediggaz comin' to ya

[Verse Eight: The Grym Reaper]
Dead stinkin' rotten, your braincells forgotten
The past, you had your bumba raas pickin' cotton
Now ya hate ya knotty hairstyles
I guess you figure the texture is too wild
Child

[Outro: The RZArector]
Two cups of blood, boy
Two cups of blood, girl
Aw, drink that shit up
