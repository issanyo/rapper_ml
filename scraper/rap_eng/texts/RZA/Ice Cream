(1st Verse)
Ice Cream, Ice Cream, Delight-ning
Indulging in a bowl full of honeys in icing
Fashionista maintenance pricing
High-class ass, but the budget is enticing
Vise gripping or grip vising
Still whipping up and dicing
Homemade cream with the peaches
Let me in on Vicky’s Secret
Hand on her left breast; pledging her allegiance
Now all she knows is stars and semen
Fuck sequenced stripes
The ice cream man is getting down tonight
Get down with the rhythm that Canvas be kicking
Everybody down with the rhythm
Banana splitting, chocolate pudding, sugar plum dipping
How I get inside her
Sour remarks, key lime pie her
Now I’m dipping something like a diver
O.P.P. sample testing
“Yeah you know me”
Bitches more bitter than balsamic dressing
Butterscotch chicks are a blessing
Chocolate almonds over everything

(Hook)
Ice cream, ice cream, strawberry truffle
Ice cream, ice cream, peppermint doubles
Ice cream, ice cream, butter pecan
Ice cream, ice cream, butter we can

(2nd Verse)
Bravo!
Ice cream on my left wrist that’s Movado
Feel like lotto
All about the Benjamins; brand new motto
Fuck YOLO
Got your mind state drugged up for promo
Ice cream, ice cream, Choco Taco
I eat ice cream from Morocco

(Hook)
Ice cream, ice cream, blueberry truffle
Ice cream, ice cream, caramel couples
Ice cream, ice cream, butter Rican
Ice cream, ice cream, butter we can

(Bridge)
Ice cream, ice cream, lemon-lime swirl
You’re the main reason I can’t fuck with you girl
Ice cream, ice cream, peanut butter crunch
Got me coming back for lunch
Ice cream, ice cream, French sorbet
Let a nigga lick it girl. I love the foreplay
Ice cream, ice cream, cherry on top
Throwing down gwap ‘til that shit go pop!
