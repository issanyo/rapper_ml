[Intro - RZA (Jammie Sommers)]
So we gon' check the 25th caller

You're on the air, sweetheart
(Hello, yeah, I'd like to make a request

(Oh, I love that song!
Oh my God!)
Here it is, just for you, sugar

[RZA]
Bobby Digital back on the set
Watch girl's pussies get wet wet wet wet wet
Drip drip drip drip, drop drop drop drop
Hip-hop you just can't stop stop stop stop
Watch my Glock Glock Glock Glock Glock
It goes pop pop pop pop pop
My Glocko pop pop pop
My Glockoes pop pop pop
His rugged go pop pop pop pop
You stomp the fuck off yo' block
My Glockoes pop pop pop
My Glocko pop pop pop (x4)
You stomp the fuck off yo' block
My Glocko pop pop pop

Bob Digi-tech live in effect, you just didn't expect
One man to come along and bring a new song
And break your barrier down, you can't carry the sound
Buckwild juvenile from Shaolin Island, what? What?
Who wants to get violent? Remain silent

My Glocko pop pop pop
My Glocko pop pop pop
His Glocko pop pop pop
His Glocko pop pop pop
My son go pop pop pop
My gun go pop pop pop
His Glocko pop pop pop
One love, go pop pop pop
His love go pop pop pop

[Method Man (Masta Killa)]
Yo.. who wanna play the hero? Your chances are slim
Less than zero, Shaolin laboratory friend
That's the shit though, came to satisfy but can't get no
Sound pasified from the get-go, Cuban neckties for you Kiko
Only carry mines for protection, the hoods like the Wild West I reckon
Hold up a second, lost my breathe and
Take it from the top Introducin'! (Mr. Method)
Runnin in your session
With nothin but my words as my weapon
And twenty-eight years of aggression
Do it for my people when I take it back
Like I'm repo-man, agent double-oh negro
Know who I am? No, I don't give a damn
Evil, flash a Crooked I like I'm Deebo
Gets down and dirty like your moms pots and pans
From a small town, drink ya down like Shazaam!
This is how ya Enter the Wu-Tang Clan (Yeah)
36 Chambers, you're pu-tang man (Word)
Brothers with a mic make a true slang fan(Yeah)
Brother with a gun make the loot change hands (Word)
That's how it is, you could ask RZ-A
Through rain, hail or snow I deliver

[Interlude - Jammie Sommers]
DJ, that music just turns me on

[Masta Killa]
The marvelous bone crushin assassin appears to be
Blind in glasses
Daredevil bang head with shovel
Iron skin, Tony Starks, liquid metal
The rebel in the evenin, shadows sweapens, vanishin
The book of instruction, fuckin with the Wu-Tang Production
Is lord to all who come and see, my art too deadly to teach
Read my death touch, ascended grief between each point
Slendid, hand Swingin Sword recommended
Slice through the bone intended
Try to sketch the classes, reflection of perfection
Mic-phone swing like numb stick to scar
Mohammed Ali, mic MC, Shakwan walk the dead sea
Dead sea, Digi..

[Streetlife]
Yo, yo.. yo..
My mind keeps playin tricks, I'm caught up in The Matrix
Digital mode, your flows is all wasted
You smoke weed with seeds, I crush mines and lace it
Two tokes a pass, kid it's all basic
I know you lust, so relax and be patient
As soon as I spark the stem, ya all taste it
Number one on the charts, it's time to erase it
Replace it, you was wack from the start, face it

[Interlude - Jammie Sommers]
DJ, that music just turns me on

[RZA]
My Glocko pop pop pop
His love go pop pop pop
My Glocko pop pop pop (x5)
You stomp the fuck off yo' block
My Glocko pop pop pop
His Glocko pop pop..

[Outro - Jammie Sommers]
DJ, that music just turns me on
