[Intro: Alicia Keys]
Your girlfriend
Alicia Keys
Come on

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Maybe silly for me to feel
This way about you and her
Cause I know she's been such a good friend
I know she has helped you through
Talkin' late on the phone
Every night you've been callin'
Private moments alone
Could your heart soon be fallin'?
And I know she's a friend
But I can't shake the feeling
That I could be losing your heart

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although, she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
You said that she's one who helped you see
How deep you're in love with me
And intentions were not to get in between
But I see possibilities
And you say that you feel
I'm the best thing in your life
And I know it's real
And I see it in your eyes
There's no reason for me
To even feel this way
I know you just enjoy her company

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although, she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

[Bridge: Jermaine Dupri & (Alicia Keys)]
Say you jealous but you can't tell me why
Say you jealous but you can't tell me why
Say you jealous but you can't tell me why
(It's enough to make a nigga go crazy)

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although, she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you
