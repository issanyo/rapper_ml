[Intro: Wise Intelligent]
Yeah, know what I'm saying?
Wise Intelligent, broadcasting live from the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro
Know what I'm saying?
Hip hop go wherever I go
For real, Poor Righteous Teachers represent
'96 off the hook we're dropping this hit kid
Watch

[Verse 1: Wise Intelligent]
Lord, how you be, that of G, peace God
Fuck frauds, get yours, kick ass, leave scars
On Mars I built a school to study life on Earth
Thoughts burst, a million rappers murdered in the first verse
Now what's worse than eating dirt, being buried alive
Put to death by surprise in the name of black gods
Ain't I most fly? Young pie don't cry
Dry the tears from your eye and your lover might live
Life to give, life to take, never making mistakes
All wise enjoying everything right and exact
Poor facts, pro-black, Donnelly Homes projects
Learn that time is the same on Casio or Rolex
Knowledge James, chapter two, verse one through six
But try not to judge a man by the price of his kicks
Come off this talk shit â€” convert words to actions
'Cause you know Jersey runs things every time boy
Build destroy, Trenton must make noise
Enjoy the fruits of life, need the wife and my boys
My seed won't need for anything, trust me
Black man, 'nuff land, eight hundred acres of trees
Please the seven seas travel regularly
Degrees consciously study everywhere we be
Family daring he who talks enough shit
And come and get the stitch to fix the split upper lip
The shit providers
Will call us great civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers black

[Hook: Nine]
Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God's worth is birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers

[Chorus]
Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er

[Verse 2: Wise Intelligent]
Intelligent, twenty-three, now nineteen five
Hold the mic I'll rise right in front of your eyes
In here six years see what I felt every year
Oh yeah it's ninety-six I'm born and understanding, understood
Get the goods, build a school down south
In some remote location that nobody knows about
Teach, add on to the life that we live
God degree, twelve jewels, eat the food that I give
No pig, strictly kosher mathematics and fact
Poor blacks on track mission to take the Earth back
'Cause Whitey got it locked, that's why the whole world mourns
We wearing crowns made of thorns and being put to the cross
Lost souls futures told in the Dead Sea Scrolls
God reduced to a savage lacking soul control
Talking lots of shit about his drugs and guns
Several daughters, 'nuff sons, ain't trying to raise none, yo
Whoa-ho-ho, let me slow up with the flow
Can't move too quick because niggas got to know
The duty of the civilized is to civilize the uncivilized
And make the world recognize
That God is Wise, and Wise is God to the death
And back to life, you Lazarus and I'm the Christ
The forthcoming, like a thief in the night
The wave of light, the key to everlasting life
That shit provide us, to call us straight civilizers
And truth suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all

[Hook: Nine]
Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God worth his birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers

[Chorus] (x2)
Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er

[Verse 3: Wise Intelligent]
Since I've been away I've been thinking about
How gunslingers turned singers and black culture went out
Wake up all you teachers tired of teaching and wait
Grass roots, pass truth into the ears of black youths
Watch me talk the talk and walk the walk right now
As mystic as it seems, I bring for real to your dream seeing
Midnight marauder got it dipped off the block drug
Street niggas bug 'cause they know we do it for the love
We rose above every limit that they said we had
Who loves your ass enough to strictly educate the mass?
Come get your cash, fill your mind with swine and dash
For longevity, these niggas we will never be
You will remember we from now till forever G
I am infinity, lyrics flowing endlessly
You ain't no friend to me so don't even pretend to be
Like O.J. Simpson be sleeping with the enemy
I call you out and make the world know your ass is lacking
Quoting some lessons but see no parts of understanding
You standing under my rain, snow, sleet, hail and thunder
That's why you wonder what's causing this to exist
I raise the mist, distill the myths of many currents
Don't be determined except to life forget the death
Nevertheless you're being blessed 'cause I'm who God is
Don't know the time niggas must be wearing Guess watches
Hands on your boxes, turn 'em up like seven notches
Your Magnavoxes amplify my super conscious
Shit providers, we'll call us straight civilizers
And truth suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all

[Outro: Wise Intelligent (Nine)]
Hold it down kid and you don't stop
P.R.T. represent shop
(There's a new set of rules you shall all have to abide by
And the non-lyrical shall be terminated)
