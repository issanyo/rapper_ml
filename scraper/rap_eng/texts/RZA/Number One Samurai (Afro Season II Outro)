[RZA]
A brother strive to stay alive without killing no one
His swordplay exceeds the speed of your gun
He's stunned by the sliced, so pertrise, so concise
Dice your arm off before you even bring twice
Still old afro naughty king of a castle
Part of William statues for those who died in battle
Ninjas flow like a sparrow, twist up like a gyro
Trying to bring my father back through synthetic bio
Ceeo must be evil for outta for cathedral
To think she can go against the mighty Afro
Oh! no whether friend or foe
Until voted number one they all fall below

[9th Prince]
Yo, yo
Verbally I'm a beast released to the streets
Spit on the cross, choke the reverend
Fuck it I'mma kill the priest
9th Prince lyrical samurai
Cocaine cowboys lynch from here to Panama
Check out my double edge sword
Killarm woodlot my third eye is my shield
I choose to kill by will
Duckin parole, now I am on the run like track and field
The black Samson, keep a blade in my afro
Ask your ho about the grandaddy flow
Watch me kill this bitch ass nigga in slow mo'
I'm from Staten Island but now I live in Harlem the city of Gotham
Who the fuck got a problem?
