Blessed love my lark, blessed love empress
All teaching of ways, all prince and all princess
Gods and goddess, kings of de earths, kings of de earths
Heeeya-hahahahaha!

[Junior Reid]
Jah live the +Righteous Way+
Teaching the youths of today
Bobby Digital do and then them say
Love with me today
Love with me today
Baby this is what they say
I'm gonna lead the youths in my stray
No foul play, no foul play
Want them of love all the way, and no foul play
Want them of love and not the negative way
RZA want no drive-by car, then we will see about how we are
Am I going the digital way, send all the youth to the digital way

Jah live the +Righteous Way+
Leading the youth of today
Tell them to watch and pray
A child shall lead the way, the way

Jah live the +Righteous Way+
Teaching the youths of today
Bobby Digital do agree to tell them say
Love shall lead - love is the only way
Love we want in America, in Jamaica, and in Africa
Love all over the world, for all women boys and girls
Men women boys and girls

Let it be known
Let it be-let it be known
Let it be known
Some said Bobby oughta burn in hell because these fancy bitches
Got a closet full of kung-fu flicks and nasty pictures
A library to decipher anything religious
He beg for mercy, we pray for Allah forgiveness
Rough nights, tough nights police cuff tight
Locked the fuck up, someone's mad enough to snuff Mike
Couldn't fuck right or puff right
This 15-year-old bastard got drunk and stuck like
The kid in the GangStarr vid, Just to Get a Rep
Pop was a klep, moms out on the steps
See sometimes he feel like a motherless, starve for another kiss
At night search the skies and searchin for the mothership
Only to find it's all inside yourself
Are you ready for the things of mental health?
This old man had a lack of mental health
Because his grandfather clock got to old for his shelf
So he had to die with a cold on his chest
The Old Earth said that the soul went to rest
Something that we never could understand
Is what he told me, sayin;
"Yo, how could the ghost be holy?"
That's what he told me, when I watch TV all I see
Is unfriendly ghosts is bustin through like Scream Part 3

[Junior Reid]
Them say Digital way
All the youths, them ah say
They wants them to live in the Rastaman way
Now follow Babylon way, long time nah Babylon ah lead them astray
They want Bobby Digital way, say the pussy and the +Righteous Way+
Want the Rastaman way, Rastaman never lead you astray
Righteous way
Righteous way
Now lead the youths, them astray
Tell them to watch and pray
Just, watch and pray
Jah will lead the way
A brighter day
Youths are the future, oh yeah
