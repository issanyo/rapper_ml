[Sample]
I wanna love him
But what if he hurts me?
Oh

[Verse 1]
Faith like broken hearts
Warm like mothers arms
Holding me close in the dead of the dark
You're fake like false alarms

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been holding on for way too long
I can feel the fever coming on
Oh

[Chorus]
So what if I'm emotional?
I feel it in my bitter bones
Oooh I need somebody to hold me
Oooh I need your body to tell me I'm the only one
Oh, can anybody help me now?
Cause I'm on on a high that's coming down
Ooh I need somebody to hold me
You don't need to tell me, I know that it's love, cause it hurts

[Sample]
I wanna love him
But what if he hurts me?
Oh

[Verse 2]
Dress my open wounds
I'm not over you
I'm just a puppet you played for a fool
Your sex is my abuse

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I've been holdin' on for way too long
But I can feel the fever coming on, oh Lord

[Chorus]
So what if I'm emotional?
I feel it in my bitter bones
Oooh I need somebody to hold me
Oooh I need your body to tell me I'm the only one
Oh, can anybody help me now?
Cause I'm on on a high that's coming down
Ooh I need somebody to hold me
You don't need to tell me, I know that it's love, cause it hurts

[Bridge]
Baby please I need you darling
I’m bleeding darling
I know that it’s love

[Pre-Chorus 3]
So what if I'm delusional?
Don't wanna face it any more, no no

[Outro]
Oooh I need somebody to hold me
You don't need to tell me, I know that it's love, cause it hurts
