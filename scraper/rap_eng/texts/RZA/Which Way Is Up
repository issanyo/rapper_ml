[Verse 1: RZA]
There once was a boy by the name of Michael
He was the type of brother who did like to
Rob and steel [?]
Even kill just to get a meal
But he didn't eat reddened me
Instead he filled his head with getting hot treats
15 years old, strong young blood
Who didn't say no when it came to drugs
The panic never taught him, it only bored him
Then one day, his father caught him
Thus, he was thrown out of his home
A young black youth, out on his own
From many shelters, he was kicked
Now he lives like a derelict
In the gutter, I say the brother is stuck
Acting depressed now which was is up

[Hook]
Which way is up? Anybody tell me?
Which was is up?

[Verse 2: RZA]
Now Mary, Mary on the contrary
She was a girl who was extraordinary
Everyday she went to the library
Hanging out was secondary
Stacked in the back, her look was dope
Reputation clean like a bar of soap
17, a virgin queen
Church going girl if you know what I mean?
But her best friend Lynne was full of sin
Been having sex since the age of 10
Influenced Mary within a year
[?] expensive gear to wear
And earrings to put into her ear
Married soon, forgot all about [?]
Increased her speed chug and weave
But instead she loves to smoke weed
Her reputation is now filthy
Neighborhood hooker, feeling rather guilty
Weed smoking a blunt scratching a blunt
Asking the question, which way is up?

[Hook]
Which way is up?
Yo yo yo Which was is up?
Ay ay, which way is up?
