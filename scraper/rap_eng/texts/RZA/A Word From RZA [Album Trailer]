[A Word From RZA]:
Yo, peace and blessings
My name is the RZA, from the all mighty Wu-Tang Clan
I'm zonin' in with my home girl, SZA
Self-savior, Zig-zag-zig, Allah
Yeah, I think you can take it that far mama
You know what I mean?
Cut loose the drama
No melodrama
Rise to the top
Claim yo karma
And it's my honor
To drop this lesson
It's my honor
To give this blessing

[S (Self-savior)]:
Self-savior
Sophisticated syncopations
Smokers several strands of high potency stimulation
A soulful songstress
See, sometimes a woman is the strongest one inside the cypher
So why y'all niggas all getting hyper, huh?
She could be stubborn born, yeah, but she could never be stupid
You may think that she's being strange
Nah, she's being wise and being studious

[Z (Zig-Zag-Zig)]:
Reverse the S, it's stress girl, return it back to a Z
The zig-zag-zig, yeah
So find a zig in me
The Xena who could rise again
Up on the ashes like a phoenix
Usable zillionaires
So fuck all y'all rap billionaires
Haha, hey
Self-savior boy, we told you, you better save yourself
You stupid motherfuckers, you putting wealth before yo health
In every drop of semen, there's a potential human being
In every man that's born through the womb of a woman is born here as a free man
In every womb will carry the chance for life and infinity
In every woman she has inside her divine identity
But y'all got it backwards boy
So you need to get smacked backwards boy
Back into the past
Yo, let's backtrack their ass
And zero out these zombies
These weak ass Uncle Tommys
My-

[A (Allah)]:
Yo, see Allah's the all I see and the all knowin', the all flowin'
Over land, sea, sky and the ocean
The controller of space, time, and motion
From darkness of the universe to the first letter of this verse
Amplified through your Apple device
Appearing as a voice, her, SZA
Cut through them, paper thin
Open up their ears and let the melodies enter in
And whether sober or drunk, smokin' bongs, or smokin' blunts
Let's get it mama, they can't front
With self-savior, zig-zag-zig through apex
Nah, ain't nothin' change
But yo, yo baby girl
Do what the fuck you gon' do and shine on these niggas, aight
So they can understand, yo
