[Shintendo64]
Skinny in the face/
Yet I'm Jolly Like Roger/
Wit an Aye Aye Type-o-Swag
I can make her holler
For a dollar maybe less
The craziness has got me tweek-in
MY Mind Is Off The Scale Im Bout To Bail So Where Da Weed Shit?
Im Off Of The Pot/
If You Don't Fuck Wit It Ha!/ I Got a loaded fucking BLASTER that'll spit when its hot/
You try to run away we'll gun your way
Have you missing Summer Days
Spray A Phaser through your brain then lay ya with the cunts- you - slain
The village was speechless No one had seen shit
According to the orders I had barked at em for reasons
That were clearly as vivid as any motion picture screening/
I caused fucking a ruckus Like I promised in the last track
Uchiha Xen
Who be the man
Shin/10/6-4
The Terra turned God dropping flame to y'all shit flows
So roll me up a blunt so I can be one with Mythos
While Sky fighting Air raiders Gliding holding pitchforks...
