[MC MajeK]
You never touch a microphone
If he flow-switch like a lycan dome
Known to jack and roam in packs and 
Flowing make a broken back
What did he know
Don't matter I got a knack for attacking rappers genomes
Jetpack and hijacks
Crack dealers
Chill and Spill and kill a millameter
Mic Checker redeema
Seen backflippers act sicker than these whack spitters
So this is war
Chords vortex make more checks
And emcees turned to torn necks
The Lyrical blacksmith lack much civil
A principle
Oh it so simple
How he drop tracks and flow keep expanding like ripples
The MC's too primitive
To be rhymin modern sentences
I get to flipping scripts
Then sly gets to rippin it

Warring flows
We using rhymes in defense

Never overdosing on my motor spit Supernovas
Going over quotas if cold's the limit 
Close to inventing the menacing venemous style my writtens' been in this beat 
For about 40 miles
Its a known fact 
Go back or get your life cut short by this lumberjack
Metaphorical Kraken never slacking stacking platinum plaques for snacking on these
Rappers
The city sacker, titty smacker, gritty rapper
He Absorb the suns; the energy tapper
