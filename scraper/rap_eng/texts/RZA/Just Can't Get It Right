[Intro: RZA]
One, two, it’s the Brooklyn Zu
Three, four, better shut your door
Five, six, nigga, get yo' shit
Seven, eight, gonna lay 'em to sleep
One, two, it’s the Brooklyn Zu
Three, four, nigga, shut your door!

[Verse 1: Shorty Shitstain]
I make money, money don’t make me
I squeeze them honies, homie don’t hate me
I keep my money in a Hefty bag
Fuck a safe, I pack a fo-fo automatic
I ain’t your average rapper, I ain’t your average camper
I’m on some new shit and you can get adapter
I had it up to here, I had it up to here
Wit' niggas, with them counterfeitin' flows this year!
I know a lot of ya’ll niggas can’t get it right
Just can’t get it right, just can’t get it right

[Hook: RZA]
Y'all niggas, just can’t get it right
Just can’t get it, just, just can’t get it right!

[Verse 2: 12 O'Clock]
Hold guns like the bar that hold the shower curtains
I’m in the club, watch my watch, let my diamonds flirtin'
Time to leave, and these two girls sayin' somethin'
Cross the Brooklyn Bridge, now a nigga finger fucking
Papa Wu crib full, C.R.E.A.M, watch the purses
You better believe I’m holding like the service
K-Tab rock bulletproof suburbans
Two more suburbans, bodyguards rockin' turbans
Putman Avenue, Uncle Freddy watch the dirt in
Take Saudi and murder it, soundtrack 4-thirdin'

[Hook 2: RZA & (Shorty Shitstain)]
(I know a lot of ya’ll niggas can’t get it right)
(Just can’t get it right, just can’t get it right)
Y'all niggas, just can’t get it right
Just can’t get it, just, just can’t get it right!

[Verse 3: Young Dirty Bastard]
Born in a race that lies no definition
Write rhymes in brown sand, fuck the composition!
Eliminatin' those who are fake is my decision
I send the hail mary to your God, now convert ya whole religion
If the sky had eyes, he could see the pussyness
In all you tender loving business guys
I can see the future maggots in all you flies
Hammer start seeing the weakness, niggas terrified
Listen, I fed a pig to a savage then he jumped like rabbit
Dumped a ball in a hoop then he caught AIDS

[Hook 2]
