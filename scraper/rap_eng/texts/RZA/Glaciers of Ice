[Intro]
Yeah, yo son you gotta take me to get them Clarks, man

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Stand on the block, Reebok, gun cocked
Avalanche rock get paid off mass murderous services
Chef break 'em, watch the alley cats bake 'em
Po-nine made 'em, drop grenades and take 'em
Quick fast we reflect like the sky be blue true
Wu-Tang saga continue
Rap Meyer Lansky crash your fantasy
Getting high fellas stand by, here's the plan, see
Sit back collecting Tecs and cheques and
Flowing slow in a Montero flexing
Beats break heavily word to INS bless me
Throw me like three bags of cess
For real from the Killah Hill locked and caged in
We're sworn representatives, we acting like made men
Strive for wives, nine lives and lies
Max, sell and enjoy the highs, what?

[Hook: Raekwon and Ghostface Killah]
The treasure is the glaciers of ice, original man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone kaper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony
Degrees of punishment increase intensely
Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums
But the battle was won by swords being swung
Slicing with a vocal, from the international vocalist
Your style is too local to fuck with this
Offensive antagonist
No assistance, moving motionless
Mysterious swiftness
Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain
Mental gives the signal to the physical
Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle
Violent temperaments left continents dented
Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented
Drunk by the drunken puncheons that punctures the heart
Vital sparks from the arteries stopped

[Hook]
The treasure is the glaciers of ice, original man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone kaper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Straight up and down it's all good
Peace to them cheque cashing, chain snatching, gun flashing
Niggas in the hoods bubbling good
Analyze Starks, who be buying lion heads and Clarks
To all my house bitches, Starks'll be home soon
I'm on tour chill, catch me '96 in June
But until then my ten-man team be safe
Chill on the whips for seven months, we can all get laced
Take a boat cruise, sip daiquiris and max
Swimming pools, fly jewels, Wally shoes, blow stacks
Relax kids, black kids got a craving for Cris
Until we get back, unpack, leave the Mac with your Wis'
But whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth
Spread Wu-ness, rule this, civilization's cursed
But luckily I'm born to be wild and then be out
Move crowds collect twenty thou and then be out
Heavy convoys my crew keep pretty boys paranoid
Built like a steroid pat down Dan Aykroyd
My seeds, grow with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family

[Hook]
The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone kaper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her

[Break: Ghostface Killah]
My seeds, run with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family

[Outro: 60 Second Assassin]
It's been a long time since the Father left in '69
It's been a long time since Wu Tang had the chance to shine
It's been a long time since we had diamonds, gold and drink Cristal wine
It's been a long time of walking around here dumb, deaf, and blind
It's been a long time since you had the Son of Man chant like golden wine
It's been a long time...
