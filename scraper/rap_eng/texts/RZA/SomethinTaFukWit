From movie scenes of bruce lee bruising his knee
To losing semen in lucid dreams till i'm ruling the sea/
This guru houdini's through voodoo and genies
If you choosing to see me i'm shooting ya beanie

We let the people decide we hire shooters to shoot/
But pass the needle in your eye and i'll suture the truth
The ruder the movement the louder the sound
I do this for hip hop while underground
Ya'll some dramatic half ass wacckk cat
My hypothetical mac blast when i see you ass rap
Fat stack of sonnets fastened in my backpack
Passing on my last lap then crashing like i'm nasdaq


A gift from the coldest, the broken, the feared
So i flow to be coping i'm hoping it's here
Lids open to tears when i'm thinking bout the truth
So i'm hitting up the booth and spitting out my tooth


I deliver sick scripture till my finger tips blister
Dipping fig newtons in a bittersweet mixture
Better meet rigor for' you benefit bigger
You're cool but i'll always be a little bit sicker

My crew/ realest facility
Seeming cool but squeal in humility
Finna balance both like fear and civility
You either feeling me or you rearing the guillotine
