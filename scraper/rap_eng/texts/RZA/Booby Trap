[Intro: RZA]
Hahaha, Digi, yo, yo

[RZA]
When I was young, I slept with a battery on my tongue
So when I spit, the impact with the sting of a stun gun
At full blast, rock your cradle, fatal razorblades graze you
Split you open, stitch you back wit' a staple
I'm football head, I put your head
Into a brook, all four, your momma wouldn't look at ya'll
Gold from the Panama canal, Alabama gal
Got me laid up, on my nuts like kapow
B-O-B Boy's fast as Bruce Leroy
Meet the rap Galactus, blow planets off his axis
My Glock is plastic, my dick *sniff* is magic
Stretch up the power you like Mr. Fantastic

[Chorus: Dexter Wiggles]
Stop, it's a booby trap
Wouldn't you rather have a Digi or a Scooby Snack?
Digi Snack, yeah, while we living in a booby trap

[RZA]
Yo, when it comes to this mic device, you get ate
Like the gingerbread man tryna cross the lake
Or the Winchester, call my white son, Lester Poindexter
Tell 'em bring back the black mack, strapped with two extra
Clips, where's the natural, words inside the apple
Potholes in the street, it cracks the Jeep axle
Shrivel your heart to a raisin, shorty star gazing
Yeah, he got steeper than dunce, once he start blazing blunts
Beef, and get drowned in Hunt's
Your flame get toast, your best bet to punt
I lounge like a hungry jaguar, into agua
Trying to catch a fish that multiply like the magua
Pocket fat like Jabba the Hutt, Clan gallops up
Feel the force of my steel, but you can't count the caliber
Digi, Digi, Digi, all inside your city
Microphone on the roam, like Capone and Frank Nitty

[Chorus: Dexter Wiggles]
Stop, it's a booby trap
Wouldn't you rather have a Digi or a Scooby Snack?
Digi Snack, yeah, while we living in a booby trap
Stop, it's a booby trap
Wouldn't you rather have a Digi or a Scooby Snack?
Digi Snack, yeah, while we living in a booby trap, yo, yo

[RZA]
I don't got a taste for blood or flesh skin
My mind, like Professor X from the X-Men
One line, cause MC's to write their albums down
Devils only come amongst you, if you allow them now
Due to trading, they infiltrate with persuasion
That desire to rob and steel and make slaves of all
Living luxury, destructively, conductively
Improper nature, privately and publicly
Man so stupid when confronted by something he don't
Understand, he shoot it, the whole world's polluted
My earth gave birth to a universal change us
Scribes reflect the child born in the Bethlehem manger
Devils try to steal me of my intellect, rob me of my culture
Like they whitewashing sculptures
Like they snatching down my posters
But it's been caught through the eyes of Minolta

[Chorus: Dexter Wiggles]
Stop, it's a booby trap
Wouldn't you rather have a Digi or a Scooby Snack?
Digi Snack, yeah, while we living in a booby trap
Stop, it's a booby trap
Wouldn't you rather have a Digi or a Scooby Snack?
Digi Snack, yeah, while we living in a booby trap, yo, yo
