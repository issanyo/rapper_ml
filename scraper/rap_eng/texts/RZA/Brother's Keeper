[Chorus: Infinite]
I'm my brother's, brother's keeper
Through the struggle, our bond is deeper
I know you'll be there, when I need ya
Cuz we're brothers, brother's keeper

[The Reverend William Burk]
Nevertheless, in spite of
Sibling rivalries, my kin will still ride for me
I'm back to society, killas be moving silently
The world steady trying me, my girl steady trying me
At least I got my brother, he never 'fraid to die wit me
Through our trials and tribulations, it's torturous
With a bulletproof bond, hell fire ain't even scorching this
Ten times stronger than the magic of a sorceress
And never put a broad first, no matter how gorgeous she is
We rugged warriors, always come out victorious
Our battles be the gloriest, but that's just how the story is
Love is love love, and all is fair in love and war
My comrade a killer, to the solid core we keep it raw
I got your back like a chiropractor blood pure
[Chorus]

[RZA]
Yo, no other could compare to a brother, even from another mother
We bond and love her, our spirits hover over each other
In mutual conflicts, chained together like convicts
I hold you up by my shoulders, under your armpits
He ain't heavy, he my broham, ready for the program
Whether busting shots, throwing blocks, swinging swords, throwing hands
They can end to the end, not near friends
A kin beyond skin complexion, a hard connection
God protection, loyal, without question
My heart is his heart, my possession his possession
Although life is daily right, makes us sometimes appear weaker
I'm still there for you brother, I'm my brother's keeper
Blessed be the meak, if we strive and to be meaker
Plus, we flow together like the mic through the speaker
Through good times and bad times, happy or sad times
Anytime, all the time, until we reach a flatline
Link like medallions to cables, mixers to turntables
Never turn on each other, like Cain did to Abel
Nah, we stay stable, from the grave to the cradle
And after I save myself, I promise I will save you
Cuz you my brother, and i'm my brother's keeper
You're my brother, and I'm my brother's keeper

[Chorus]
