Intro (Ghost Dog) :

There is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream
When you have something like a nightmare
You will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream
It is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this

Verse (Acey Ten) :

Hey yo I'm right back I write that
No star no war when my empire strikes back
I'm outta the game homie you know it's like that
Call me Terminator and I'll be right back
I punch that line like Mike Tyson in fight nights
Same power but I got a bigger mind
4th line rollin' on ya feet can you feel us ?
Haters hate us because they ain't us
Motherfucker, don't be heinous
Keep ya cheeks tight if you hide drug in ya anus
I'm not a P.O. I'm a psych nurse
One flew over the cuckoo's nest ? Nothing about us !
A.C.E.Y. bitch, screw all ya bastards
Fake killers on a microphone
Still droppin' shit like they sick of methadone
I got a headache please leave my ears alone, beeeetch!
Old school, new school I got my own school
No mattress on the floor when you pass out, fool
I'm from the 89 with a white color in my wine
No money no skill but a lotta dreams in my mind
