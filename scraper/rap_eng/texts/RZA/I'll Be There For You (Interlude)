[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Ride together, cry together
I swear to god, I hope we fucking die together

[Verse: College Smart]
Every time I speak about a thousand people listen
And still I'm only talking to the only one who isn't
You got me twisted, like you're talking physics
And I don't really get it so I'm failing all your quizzes
I ain't no science major, but we got chemistry
Let's keep the class, bae, and talk this out respectfully
Know how this story ends, you gon' leave
Then you have a couple drinks and you end up in my sheets
That's cause you know how I study all you whereabouts
You aced Anatomy, I’ll teach you what you never learned about
Uh, and we can fall asleep together
Wake up in the morning feel like everything is better
Bra on the floor, it's cool, boo, you can keep my sweater
That way we meet again, you know I’m down for you whenever
Yeah, I changed the topic, to let you know I’m into you
We can talk later, this is just the interlude
Hey, this is just the interlude
This is just the interlude
Just me and you
It’s just me and you
Ride together, die together
Maybe we in the end we find out that we wrong
But tonight we got no problems at all, you my dawg
Hey, you my dawg
Forever and ever

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Ride together, cry together
I swear to god, I hope we fucking die together
