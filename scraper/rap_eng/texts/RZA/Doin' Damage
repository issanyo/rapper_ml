[Intro]
Yeah
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo
It's been a minute since I flipped one like this, yo
This take me back to like...95
Ayo, it's time to kill

[Verse 1]
First off, I never advocated fabrication
Advocated those mentala for imagination
I seen you rock into the crowd, those are statues
Don't want to hop on a track, I will lap you
You better run hard when I come, Lord
Far from the experience to kill the game like Slum Dog
Ayo I heard 'em say, homie tryna murder me
He ain't got a burner be he nervous with the vertebra
I never stop winning, top billing, rhymes top tenning
Loaded and locked in it, the rap Bob Dylan
Scratch that more like John Lennin
Fear not a drop in 'em, no lie, I am no bodge cleanin
Smooth like Spartans, film like Hershey
Walk in, murk beats often
Hell yeah, I'm loving it, Napalm what up with it
Haters wanna stop my simulation like Republicans
Get abominated, I treat my rhyming sacred
Come in in a black whip like a dominatrix
Leave 'em naked and bare, they going hibernation
What you facing is real, I come from out the basement
Yes sir, the one they call O, the flame thrower
Fans get arrested when they coming screaming"fire!" at my shows
The higher power flow, I had told her I had powered folks
Uninspired, un-admired liars try to master quotes
No bull-shit for you to stop my dividends
Approaching, making chicks clits spit oceans
I'm killing this, ill spit diligent
My talk riveting, fly walk militant
My God! I go hard, dollar currency dropping
So my mind bout that gold like a Vice Lord, fo' sure
And from the intro meaning from the get go
Really should've know that my lips so schizophrenic
Kids don't panic, yeah the name Omen but the mind not satanic

[Hook]
I'm doing damage
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm doing damage
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm doing damage

[Outro]
From the rhymes and the lines I apply to the page
Still a flow that's as sharp as a side of a blade
South Side on the rise in the Chi where I staid
Don't get out of your place, yo, I'm doing damage
