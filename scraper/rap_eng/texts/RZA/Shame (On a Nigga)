[Intro: Serj Tankian]
I fuck yo ass up
I fuck yo ass up (fuck him up son)
I fuck yo ass up (fuck him up son, wu for life​​​​)
I fuck ya ass up (fuck him up)

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Yo, I'll fuck your ass up!

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
(Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut!)
S.O.A.D., live and uncut
Styles unbreakable, shatterproof
To the young youth, you wanna get gun? Shoot!
Blaow! How you like me now?
Don't fuck the style, ruthless wild
Do you wanna get your teeth knocked the fuck out?
Wanna get on it like that, well then shout
Come on
Lazers and blazers, hit me with the major
The damage, my Clan understand it be flavor
Gunning, humming coming at ya
First I'm gonna get ya, once I got ya, I gat ya
You could never capture a nigga man's stature
For rhyme and for rapture, got niggas resigning, now master
My style? Never!
I put the fucking buck in the wild kid
Let's get together!

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Yo, I'll fuck your ass up!

[Verse 2: RZA]
I bought like 20 white boys in the back of a pickup truck
With hockey pucks and skateboards on the way to Woodstock
Leave home the Glock
I have a gun the size of a black hole
Shoot planets, don't get frantic, throw your hands up in the air
Don't panic
Supreme arm, leg, leg, arm, head
Wu-Tang Clan, tight as long dreads

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Yo, I'll fuck your ass up!

[Verse 3: Serj Tankian]
I come with that loco style from my vocal
Couldn't peep it with a pair of bi-focals
I'm no joker, play me as a joker
Be on you like a house on fire, smoke ya
Crews be acting like they gangs, anyway
Be like, "Warriors, come out and play"
Burn me, I get into shit, I let it out like diarrhea
Got burnt once, but that was only gonorrhea
Dirty, I keep shit sticks in my drawers
So I can get fuzzy-funky for you
Murder, taste the flame of the Wu-Tang, rah!
Here comes the Tiger versus Crane
I'll be like wild with my style
Punk, you play me chump, you get dumped
Wu is coming through at a theatre near you
And get funk like a shoe
What?

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Yo, I'll fuck your ass up!
I'll fuck your ass up!
I'll fuck your ass up!
I'll fuck your ass up!
I'll fuck your ass up, bitch!
