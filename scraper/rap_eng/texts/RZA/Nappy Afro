I still get busy in my nappy afro
My, my, my nappy afro
My, my, my nappy afro
I said I, I said I, I said I
I still get busy in my nappy afro
My sword slice through Peter Pan's shadow
Stop me, I'm feeling so guilty
Check my swag, my afro still nappy
Check my swag, my afro still nappy
Check my swag, my afro still nappy

I still be sword fighting while I'm cutting the potatoes
At the same time, shit, I can slice up an eightball
At the same time, shit, I can smoke a Chris Tucker
My sword get higher than Wang Yu in Chinese Boxer
My sword get higher than Snoop Doggy in the club
I think I stab Paris young panties in the club
I feel innocent, I seen cigarettes in the club
I stab Mr. Cancer, let the nicotine flood
Fuck it, it's time to go to church
My preacher said, my afro stink
I lift my sword up, I cut the tomato out his skull
Now the preacher can't think
Some people say I got mental power
I touch a human, I can see his heart slowly devour
I'm great in impression, my sword will slice the
Nipples off your breast, something something something
Chest inflation, then I put his lungs up for donation
My eyes closed, but my third eye's swollen
I'm thinking too hard, ahh, about Jedi mind controlling
I speak so evil, I got the mouth of madness
I eat with no fork, I'm an old school savage
My teeth so bad, it's the color of cabbage
And the point of my dagger smell just like catfish
Jerry, you safe with time at the edge of my sword, shit
Boy Jones a bad ass
But I kept my grades up in Samurai class
Master taught me how to strike fast
Stuck my blade all in that ass
I stuck my blade all up in that ass
Master taught me how to strike fast

I still get busy in my nappy afro
My, my, my nappy afro
My, my, my nappy afro
I said I, I said I, I said I
I still get busy in my nappy afro
My sword slice through Peter Pan's shadow
Stop me, I'm feeling so guilty
Check my swag, my afro still nappy
Check my swag, my afro still nappy
Check my swag, my afro still nappy
Oh shit... shadow
