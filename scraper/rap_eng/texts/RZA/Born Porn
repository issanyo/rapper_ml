[Verse 1]

A slower melody over enemy torture
Remedy's toxic, petty niggas steady, necropsy conjure
Send a spell for mess, weirdness and more information
The form of more cases, the scholomance placement
Warrior born basement, pronghorns at nights off
Met' knight scoffs you boring dykes when the mic's open
Earth's tamer, making more haters than paper
Stanking floor, blood flavor, born porn, tornadoes
Sure player, got styles, I'm working hard to contain 'em
Niggas will never remember the bars that I'm painting
The rhymes that I'm framing, lazy niggas doesn't
Torné got 'em by dozens, summon Satan when I'm buzzing
Toughen up, appearing five times on top five discussions
Or at least the one that I'm doing with this russian bitch
Coughing spliffs and spring off to jupiter, stupid herb
Razor sharp, disturbing T comes around when he's unheard

[Verse 2]

Lyrically you can't get next to me at least stylistically
The best or worst MC that has ever set foot on Medellín
Stephen King couldn't picture a nigga as crooked as me
Samson with his hair uncut, niggas drop to the floor when they battle me
You best to skedaddle, G, mind's unstable
Rappers aren't able to staple my ass to the mainstream cable
Listen when I get my appraisal, call down azazel
And I'll make sure wack rappers stay off the fucking table
Imma do three more lines before I finally go to sleep
Like you niggas sleep on Torné, sober equals deep
Drunk equals cheap, stated, rhyme's unrelated, crime's outdated
God's obliterated, underrated, the mic's what I'm chasing
I could spit more but I'm wasted
If I force the art then it's tasteless, and I'm off to Hades
