With those big fat lips and those hips like that
She said "Bobby, why you spit like that?
And why you Shaolin Gods push whips like that?"

And we might get drunk and empty clips like that
Then again the Gods build like that

Honey-dipped blunts, we get high like that
Yo we dipped every day, yo we fly like that
Bitches always sayin "Why you talk like that?"
We B-Boy niggas, you know we walk like that

[RZA]

And you fake crossovers tryin to bling like that?
You know, my clique snatch ice like that
Take it down to the scale and get a price like that
