[RZA beatboxing Deck the Halls]

[Verse: Ryney]
It ain't nothing like a...
Gifted presence in some Christmas rapping shit
Such wackass stylo that we know
Even the moles look up just to laugh at it
Ya tu sabez
I'm back at it's width
Cuz you already know
He speak at length to the lyrical addicts
Hear:
The fool Falling Up the cliff precipice to the Light In The Attic
Shel Silverstein?
My hero!
And Zero in the tarot?
Straight Magic
From the waste down, like Mr. Fantastic
Butt is stuck with a firmer type of elastic
He'll stretch your arm strong
But not as long as you mind
The hanged man abracadabric
Representation of the ultimate surrender

Found the comfortable medium
And ate her for breakfast, lunch, and dinner
Just to break up with her
About 100 times
I AM inspired me to do this
To wake 100 mimes
Violetly blaze the silent sacred rays
To the power of the sun times a hundred dimes...

Some rhymes are lemons
When their lines point to limits
But your multidimensionality knows no
Grimace reminder of no holds bar
Try and hold our nuts
Just to remind us of how far we've come
And where we come from...

...quite literally...
Honky Tonk! Honky Say!
"Motherfucker Yo Diggity!"
Yeah you might see a body
Or seed from the stars
Just hauking a loogie
To spit a few bars

"But what he doin'?
And why'd he do dat doe?"
To dilute the plastic rappers
From mumbling candy bars
To pollute the airwaves
Of the ocean of commotion
Of the wanna-be's wanna-being so hard
My spiritual locomotion
All chemical potion
Is served now in every bar


I'll ***kin bleep my mother****kin self out!
**** *** **** ****** ****
I was cussing that whole time!
I don't give a mother****
You can **** on the **** **
You can suck my **** like a mother**** lime!
I don't give a ****! **** ***** so sublime!
Straight silence

(You know he does it for fun
You know he does it for the pun
Dicks a loaded gun)
