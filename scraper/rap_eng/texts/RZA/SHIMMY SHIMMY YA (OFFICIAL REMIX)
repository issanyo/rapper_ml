Intro:
(Alright, this the uhh.. Official, official remix)

Chorus:
Yeah baby, I like it raw
Ooh baby, you love it raw
Yeah baby, we love it raw

Verse:
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
I kill it once, kill it twice
Feel like this a pillow fight
Got rhymes like they use feathers
And my pillow filled with blocks of ice
Smash it on they face and they be crying to they moms
Now he lying on the pavement
Brains is splattered on the ground
I'm killing these rappers with half of the energy
Ripping and stabbing, the plan of attack is
Simplistic, they itching for more of the crack
I record when I'm sad
When I'm bored, when I'm mad
I dont bow down for nothing
Unless when I'm coughing from dabs
Bars will put 'em all in coffins
Like I was spraying the mac
And cheese, jeez Louise, please stop using
These same easy rhymes we all so used to
I fuse the words like glue, blow thru you
I poop what these dudes post on YouTube
View their food like toast on tofu
I shop in Whole Foods, eat good, smoke good too
Dont listen to shit so dont tell me what i should do
If you dont like it I got something for you
Third from the pinky, thumb put up, ignore you
Beat the track like a red head step child
Back hand it, man, you dont wanna hear me freestyle
He's so senile, young clean and free now
Did 16 days I ain't going back to GT
County, I love my bed, blankets and pizza
Your girl Aretha, homie you can keep her
My world is awesome, got a 4 star trailer
'08 Jeep, man, I been whipping that tail
Down the trails, paid bail now I'm blowing kush
My bush be looking Don, thats King no Kong
Smoking on the strong, money hella short
Really stoned chilling munching on a can of corn

Beast

(Chorus)
