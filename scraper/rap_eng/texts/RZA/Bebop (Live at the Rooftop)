[Intro: RZA]
We at the Downtown Cabinay, right across the street from the Coca Cobana
We have the midnight roof special going on
We have Choco on the wheels of steel
Slow it down for a minute Choco
Yo, Zig Zag on the M.I.C
We givin' a special tribute to Charlie Parker, here tonight
The midnight rooftop special
We gon' bring it like this, I want all ladies
Who came with their men, come on in
Get into sweety, and drink all night

[RZA]
Bebop, we walk with our hats on tilt
Pink and white silk, made of shoes on stilts
Dressed as the morning milk, plus, like the quilt
When we rock at the club, no blood got spilt
Where dime piece wizes, had they legs in the air
From being sprung by the swings, so they legs in the air
Long dresses, and they silk brassiere
Ya'll unloosen the twist, Rob came in the air

[Chorus 4X: RZA]
I rock the bebop, the bebop, the bebop
The bud-bud-a-budda-bidda bebop, bebop, somebody don't bopped bopped

[RZA]
The saxophone doctor can blow on any octave
Performance, of some of the world's greatest jazz rocker
From bebop to hip hop, back to bebop
Charlie Parker lids blow hot like boiling tea pot
From pull to press, not white and up tight
To blowin' horns, to walking with the bass up right
To having our crowns polished, and our face up right
To clean our neighborhood's and I play sometin' right

[Chorus 4X]

[Interlude: RZA]
So we still groovin' wit it
Keepin' the flow poppin' here
We gon' turn the lights down a little low
Just hide the identity, yo, yo

[RZA]
The saxophone doctor can blow on any octave
Performance, of some of the world's greatest jazz rocker
From bebop to hip hop, back to bebop
Charlie Parker lids blow hot like boiling tea pot
From pull to press, not white and up tight
To blowin' horns, to walking with the bass that's up right
To having our crowns polished, and our face up right
To clean our neighborhood's and I play sometin' right

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro: RZA]
Bebop... hehehehe
Take it back, heh
Bebop..
Bebop..
