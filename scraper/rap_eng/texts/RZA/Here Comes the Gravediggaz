[Intro]
You gotta keep saying it
Say Gravediggaz, Gravediggaz
Come on say it with me, come on
Gravediggaz, come on

Gravy, yeah, uh huh

[Grymreaper]
You don't pull on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off the old Lone Ranger
And you can't fuck with me and my men - so check it out

[Hook: Rzarector]
Yah, Here come the Gravediggaz -- repeat 3X
(Pray for your mommy)

[Verse One: Grymreaper]
Low billed competition ain't shit
Faking the funk like silicone tits
Never on the level of skill
Of a champion foes are like the Buffalo Bills
May come close but can't win, or do a damn thing, huh
I'm Merciless like Ming
As I get the wreck off I navigate a course like Chekov
Soft MCs you better step off
Will a villain ever learn, I'm killin like a mad germ
I burn MCs like a bad perm, do not turn
Cause I got you on my infrared
Wimps are dead, I pop 'em like a pimple's head
I get up and get down like I was gravity
Cause pains like cavity, then collect a salary
Foes with little or no skills I kill 'em
My shows are ill I'm making a mountain out of a molehill
Chill, or your ass'll be tooken fast
Lost in the style like Alice in the lookin glass
You wanna see the Grym get raw
Ay-yo I bust a hole shits in y'all

[Verse Two: Gatekeeper]
My style's gravy, rough and real
Reds up the rugged on my Gravedigga shield
That's how I deal with the fake frauds
I flow hard, your hearthrobs'll get robbed
I come with the wicked one stop per tons
I'm under the ground as I wreck your town
Clock my boat to hell as we dwell
To a ludicrous lunar eclipse, no two exit
I radiate gamma rays at random, I slam 'em
Yo, quick fast like the phantom
Guard my gate with a passed down cape
You wanna escape and now ain't no one safe
Check it, as I hit you with a boom from the trigga

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Rzarector]
I learned to burn rap germs like antiseptics
Then release a piece of music lyric epic
Words like proverbs
Blended braided strong like the psalm the song of king David
Potentially vital, holy as the bible
Can't allow you to worship the false idols
New form of literature, dance to the fiddler
Don't mean to riddle you God, I'm not The Riddler
Don't shoot for the moon, no, wait for high noon
While the others face doom I be in entombed
I don't squawk like a hawk or stalk like a stork
But walk in New York, stay away from pork
Rhymes are my passion, don't need the hassle
Slinging everything cause I'm king of the castle
Niggas gettin boggled, you squeak and squabble
Gravediggaz got the paperback novel
So line by line you should read, take heed
Or you'll bleed and bleed and bleed and bleed

[Hook] - repeat 2X

Pray for your mommy -- 4X

[Hook] - to fade
