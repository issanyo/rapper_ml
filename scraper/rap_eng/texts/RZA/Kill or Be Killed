[Warcloud]
Monkey dragging hammers down Indonesian stone steps
Walk in America
Medicine man fever
Snorkle in the rat's nest, hitch hiker junkie
Where is the side walk
End, knuckles drag
Julian Po, Armadillo duffle bag
Juice stars and fudge sticks
Roller coasters and ferris wheels
Two large revolvers, rock fights in alleys
Farin' more dough
Meet Mr. Constrictus (muhahaha!)
Roll up a blunt on my passport
Hittin' like a grasscourt, fabricated verbal crash course
Last horse
That gallop through snowflakes
White feathers with red tips
Died yesterday obey what the weapons say
Pointed at your face
Shoot your screamin' briefcase man
Dear Niagra, 'Death of a Salesman'
Tip-toe on 'Barbwire'
Dirty maggot sausage, fat minds of peddlers
Newstand editor, Archibald the
Lecturer
Me, man, Archibald Kray, call 'im Arky
Holocaust awfully, sippin' vanilla coffee
There's a 'Trap Door' tarantula living behind my right eye
Heavy as a slug bust, life is a Holocaust
Architect medic
Crystal bullets that flare though
Hangin' back to back in a field with a Skarekrow
Later call it elbows, spittin' the same lead
A White Humming Bird, how roses came red
Drive-in in the swamp

[Crisis]
'Kill or Be Killed'
It's me
Back in the flesh, packin' a Tec
Crackin' in ya vest, tappin' ya chest, half to the neck
Struggle with breath, wrestle with death
And ass on the set
The Knights shine while you faggots reflect
Half-step
Hold my own, Crisis never regret
The school reject with knowledge
Murder traitors, all Devils get demolished
In the county of the Lost Angels
Niggas chant the Black Knights
Like 'The Star-Spangled
Banner'
Ghetto grammar, plant you
Off the David Banner
Blue and Gold Havana's, Mecca Diems
Niggas act brave when that wet
Up in 'em
But dead the criticism
Cuz they know It'll get 'em
Beheaded
My niggas plot patiently ready to set it
Line for line rhyme for rhyme
Your Darts pathetic
Synthetic, artificial, generic
My darts'll split you
Vertically
I know you faggots heard of me

[Doc Doom]
Heard of me, heard of me, heard of me

[Chorus: Doc Doom]
It's 'Kill or Be Killed'
In these cold streets of Compton and Long Beach
That's why we dont sleep
Hold heat and roll deep
Low key
Gang bang with OG's
Bee Gees, YG's, TG's
Who want beef? Who want beef?

[Sandman]
It's the hillside strangler
Sandman the dream keeper
Eliminate your team with the streetsweeper
Spit a rap doct-erine, etched in graffiti text
Come on and get put to rest
Who wanna see me next?
The street vet
From the North-side,{Long Beach}
Pack a black Tec
Let my pants hang, use gang bang dialect
Soakin' wet
Every mornin' "Wake Up" in front the liquor store
Blue jump suit, karate shoes
Up in Denver Row

[Doc Doom]
The Killa Bee Law
Is 'Kill or Be Killed'
That's why I sleep with my steel
Cautious
Cause niggas out here kill at will
In Killa California
Where niggas put flames to foreigners
So put them things up on ya
Smoke weed, and bang corners
Bang on ya
Like what set you from?
Better have ya gun in close reach
'Rollin''
Through Compton, L.A. and Long Beach
You might get ya life took
--HOOK--
Don't come thru here shook
--LOOK--
These Cali streets
Is full of Killers and Crooks
Gangstas and cops, semi-automatics and Glocks
Niggas don't scrap no more
Them was the days of my pops
Niggas that box
Nowaday they twistin' on tops
In Killa CaL
And I don't think this shit
Ever gon' stop

[RuggedMonk]
You feel the steady impact
Of the mighty bomb jack
Blue and Gold 'S' hat 501's a chrome gat
I love to gang bang
Pants hang ridiculous
"I kicc it with
These hot heads that's off the hook"
I don't fuck with hooks,
I'm straight from the streets
Keep a chunky heat, prepare for warfare
Step and you'll get laid there
Dead on the spot
RZA signed us fresh off the block
Fo'sho you know my hammer's cocked
At all times
Still on the grind trying to get mine
Ask me how I get paid, my verbal switchblade
Ask me who I'm 'Rollin'' with I say the
"Killa Bee Gang"
Follow along, we stop like the COMPTON parade
Anybody in our way
Is for sure to get slayed
Group or Solo, Solo or Group
We only recruit
Real Soldiers, Iron Brigade Soldiers
Real niggas
Smash buildings, blaze Bloccs, so fuck feelings
Lace up the chuccs, get on the AVE & start Dealin'
'Real Shit'
Make my money flip
Compton, Cali

[Chorus x2]
It's 'Kill or Be Killed'
In these cold streets
Of Compton and Long Beach
That's why we dont sleep
Hold heat and roll deep
Low key
Gang bang with OG's
Bee Gees, YG's, TG's
Who want beef? Who want beef?
It's 'Kill or Be Killed'
In these cold streets
Of Compton and Long Beach
That's why we dont sleep
Hold heat and roll deep
Low key
Gang bang with OG's
Bee Gees, YG's, TG's
Who want beef? Who want beef?


[Outro: Doc Doom (Warcloud)]
Faggot motherfuckers
The Gang, nigga
The real G's, where you from (Compton)
The niggas bitches, what? Fuckin' wit us
Boy (L.A.) The Black Knights
West Coast Killa Bee Gang, nigga
Wu-Tang nigga, when we bang this, hear?
(Linwood, Killa Beez) Nigga
Nigga, Watts, all that, nigga
Straight up, nigga (Inglewood)
Where y'all niggas from, man?
(Malibu) Hey young'n (Hollywood)
Out here tryin' to be like the G's, nigga
Straight gangstas, man, we gangstas
Homeboy, nigga, just gang bang rap
It belongs to us, homeboy (Right, right, right)
You know I mean? That bullshit you speakin'
Is on some other shit, boy, and I mean it
'You Don't Wanna Fuck Wit Us'
(That's exactly what we be sayin')
