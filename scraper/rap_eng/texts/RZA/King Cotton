King Cotton, I’m king cotton, I’ma tell you like this
It’s your boy Lil’ B

I’m harnessed by some shit that I ain’t even seen
Demons in my mind, blood on the field
We got stripped of our love, had to pick out cotton
Hard work on the field, long nights forgotten
Put us next to the beer and drugs, fast food
Kill us off much quicker, don’t forget to eat vegetables, nigga
Often the kids turn killers, stripped of our pride
Our home connected to blocks
In the streets where we roam, in Africa
We’d probably be on a throne
Shit you never know, they ship the slaves back to Africa
We enslave ourselves, taught by the Europeans to hate ourselves
Identity problems, the magazines look nothing like you
The news tell me something different
Called us negro and nigga, called us colored and black
Bitch let’s face the facts
A toaster have more worth in America than blacks
It took a Civil Rights movement just to get us intact
How the fuck we couldn’t vote because the color of our skin
I ain’t a radical, I ain’t no racist
I’m questions I’m anxious
Down south it’s much worse, where all that slave shit started
Fucking slave masters, nigga are them bitches retarded
You feel me?
And we always forget about the Native Americans
But really, we on Earth
Fuck the names and the labels, stereotypes
Generalizations, try to put me in a box took my soul and raped it
I can never forget it, but I have to forgive 'em
I move on with my life, I got love for the world
But why the fuck they burned that church with them four little girls
And I say quit... you feel me
And they say "quit dwelling on the past it’s over"
But what the fuck they learn in school how the fuck is it over?
How the fuck can I forget about the people hanging off a tree?
For the simple fact they look like me

What am I supposed to tell my kids when they hearing these things
What am I supposed to tell my kids when the cops pull them over
Can’t even wear a hoodie, they think the car's stolen
But on the real life changing for the better
Cause this music gonna bring us together
Quit saying black and white, because it ain’t no color
Really words of separation, that’s hate my brother
A lot of the laws, they was created from hate
A lot of blood and war created by the United States
Lot of drugs and guns kept the people in place
I refuse to have a race, bitch I’m gray, you feel me
And I’m saying let’s keep it true to my roots, that’s the people
Where I come from instead of repping the stoop
Niggas dying on the block, better think about it just watch
My grandfather was a slave, that’s the fucking truth
King cotton, I’m king cotton
