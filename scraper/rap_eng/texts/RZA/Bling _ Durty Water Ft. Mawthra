(Disjointed)
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a...wait, wrong song


(Disjointed: Verse 1,2)
Yo i’m the man, get on a both knees quick
Boast these kicks with a motif spit
Choke weak pricks for a whole week, shit
No speech shows me that I don’t speak sick

I’m kidding, bboy, I’m leonard nimoy
Leroy jenkins, live long and prosper sipping tea boi
Don’t fake your death next march
Rocking toe tags walking so fast on the death march

A demigod, getting hennessy buzzed
Sending many pennies to any semi menacing thugs
Getting a massage and shedding my skin
Snake fretting women dreading getting my webbing in them

Funny how the game works, I’m loving the craft
Sunning on your lame words and cutting in half
And doing it in half the time, straight mastermind
Bloody as baths inside a calf I’m gutting to laugh

Tongue of the lamb, pungent as ham
Nice folks won’t run with the clan
Find a good rapper not under my hands
Is like tryna find normal chums I can stand

I need rest sister, bless mister
Dissing me and you’ll wake up with sex blisters
Killua, the chest fister
I’m stressed, the whole game’s a mess, sister

Get a grip, need the medicine
Pestilence esque symptoms develop quick
Swabbing the poop deck
Pirate hat, iron clad mop I’m using, wired ass

Tried to rap and the fda shut it down
I’m a striaght fucking clown, need another round
Hear the muttered sounds I utter out
Fear the haunted houses, you wanna bounce

(Mawthra: Verse 3)
Yo yo gimme bout four minutes
Imma bring ya little 16s that're more with it
Than any whittled shitstains that're your writtens
When you hear my pistol spit bang shit is raw isn't it

Motherfucker be glad that the pigs got you
I don't fuck with the court wouldn't been a lawsuit
Would've been me pullin all the sin off you
Matter' fact whole fam they get dropped too

These kids liftin up but they pen copied
Shit expect a little call if you rip off me
If you see me on the street better dip probably
Bitch dont expect a diss when you been bodied

No caution we throw the stone of wrath
Two kings on a throne of broken glass
On a path to slow the prone collapse
Of our home, the stolen notion, rap
