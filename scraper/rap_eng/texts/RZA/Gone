[Intro: Justin Nozuka]
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone…

[Hook: Justin Nozuka]
Woke up this morning, hoping
It was all a nightmare, you’re gone
Tried to get out of my bed
I couldn’t find no reason, you’re gone
It breaks my heart, cause I’ll never see you again
It breaks my heart, cause I’ll never see you again
And my heart aches, cause I’ll never see you again
You’re gone…

[RZA]
Man how I long, to see your physical form
When you left me, a part of my soul got torn
How could a body turn cold, that was once so warm
How could the spark of Allah, in your heart be gone
Who could replace the space, of Unique Ason
I know you’d rather I’d be strong, and not waste time to mourn
They say that life goes on
Especially when I see the face of your first born
When he’s rocking on stage with no shirt on
Or in the hotel lobby, getting those birds on
Through our seeds we could all reach eternity
Peace and blessings, have a safe journey
I had dreams of us laughing, drinking beer
Chasing girls, fill the world with our ideas
Then I wake up, and look up, and you’re not there
But in my third eye, I know that you’re still here
Because, through our seeds we all reach eternity
Peace and blessings, it’s just another journey

[Hook]

[Justin Nozuka]
Looked out the window and stared at the sun
I couldn’t see the light, I couldn’t see, oh lord, you’re gone
You’re gone

[Kobra Khan]
Aiyo, I can’t stop the thoughts coming out of my mind
In a broken place is where you’re eventually find
This pain, on both sides, can’t deny
Memories of you and I takes us back in time
Where we used to be together, no matter, the stormy weathers
I would ramble with, nothing could ever break us apart
And sometimes would get under the pressure, cause people jealous
But your memory would be here forever, kept in my heart
This is more than you’ll ever know, me and you inseparable
Never do we let it show, it’s so hot I’ll let you go
Thought it would last forever, guess I was wrong
And time goes by so fast, and now you’re gone

[Hook: Justin Nozuka]
It breaks my heart, cause I’ll never see you again
It breaks my heart, cause I’ll never see you again
And my heart aches, cause I’ll never see you again
You’re gone…

[Justin Nozuka]
My blood pumps with anger and sorrow and liquor
Tell me how, can I live without you now that you’re gone?
You’re gone

[RZA]
Against all odds and against all squads
And against all evil trying to come against God
We stand with the iron rod, you wield the ?sword?
I use softness to conquer the heart
I’m Divine Prince Master Rakeem Allah
Earth bound, but my mind’s in the stars
Things are reborn, life always change form
Man must reform to make the heart calm
Drunkenness, leads to non-awakeness
Causing him, to look upon his father’s nakedness
When the truth is heard, there’s no forsakin it
That which is forbidden, we don’t partake in it

[Hook: Justin Nozuka]
It breaks my heart, cause I’ll never see you again
It breaks my heart, cause I’ll never see you again
And my heart aches, cause I’ll never see you again
You’re gone…
