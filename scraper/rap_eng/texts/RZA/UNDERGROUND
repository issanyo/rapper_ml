[Verse 1]
I see an erratic massive ass asshole with talents
But skills of a cat with a mallet, when it comes to rapping
And his actions, play back from the fact
That he’s want haggling bragging hoe from Copenhagen
A slower tempo, it’s essential, to perform
His mad jagged edged craft like blacksmiths
The mic mighty, the mouse of might
Might manupulate a mime like minor
Minor shining, when the diamonds from the mud
Upon I pick it’s mine or, make my mind up
With this inner line, as the clock was declining
Fourth wall spitting and dripping raw sauce
Eating popcorn and provolone balls
Bumping Marley Marl, in a Buick car
Getting white folks annoyed, they calls hogs, but what for
Abusing whores? the horror how I slaughter and maul
With my cousin Young Psycho, angered force
Close to post mortem, 25 I split the quarter
Cut ya nose bone off, and stab it in ya torso
More or less, these wack foes flows are horderves
To a lunch from a overweight bipolar boy
At a Golden Corral food bar
Raise holy hell, through a calm storm

[Verse 2]
Dumb nigga, with a killing revision up in a building
Taking pills, acid, rocking ragged, think the pussy was Rag dolled
Mad gore, with masks off, and bath salts
A minute to killling up many, the kid with the getting
Ya gat gone, like get in the back
I'm running command, I'm making manner
Taming a mannequin, when I ran again
I just planned my shenanigans, pant again, and go panicking
The enemy you should be fearing  like ear piercings
Blocking me out, is something you be hearing
Standing in negative 2 degrees, cold feet
Fuck computers, my facts dont need to be PC
You niggas is PG, I’m in a black gi, made from geese
When I’m spitting this easy, E peasy
When I get louder, i’m in account, like ran an a mount
I'm out again, defeat with written's, but I'm a free style in
Headphones in my ears, I'm never changing gear
Stick shift, then that bitch on ride, till I get near a peer
Like I dissappeared, I don’t style
I just rhyme, now look at the time
It’s time, to show these niggas they minimized
Making a killing again again, a hit in the head
Is making me ridden, of getting Dominican bitches
But fuck em I'm in it, I'm in to make some me riches
And give it to children lil niglet, yeah yeah

[Outro]
Nah, I'm too much of a dickhead for that
But uh, one more thing
Name another nigga who skills at my age cunt!
Ok bye bye
