I agree that you're nice but see
I'm one of the nicest
You cold like north Dakota
While I'm hot like Isis
I recently became a fan of the field of Egyptology
The reason be I came to stand and yield a lotta quality
That was my first attempt at rhyming a whole sentence
So lucky for you you get to bear witness
I'm going to leave that rhyme in because one day it'll be history
Kids sit around and wonder how he did it still a mystery
It's plain to see I'm rising B
Missed your chance to invest
I wanna thank Mikki
Because he can see the best
Let's put it to rest
Like a cease and desist
When put to the test
You weak like slaps on the wrist
I keep rhyming ist
Because the shit sounds funny
Watch me make the hot list
And that's just for sounding dummy
I basically just sit down and channel these rhymes
It's so easy for me you would swear it's a crime
In time I stay about once a day
All the other time is just gone like way
Out I flout my mastery of realities
Make my own way ain't lookin for a salary
