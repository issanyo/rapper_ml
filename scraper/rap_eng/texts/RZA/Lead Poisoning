[Pre-Chorus]
Rise like coyotes
Rise like coal blackened thunder
The fleet has left
While the admiral slumbered
Vigilante Nocturno
Test the chains
Gnaw the screws
We are many
They are few

Check it
It's lead poisoning

[Verse 1: GZA]
I live in a land of black ropes, white justice
As long as she wear the blindfold, I can't trust this
I'm imagining what can bring such hate
This phobia or dislike, grounds for a debate
Some say it's trigger happy, I say it's lead poisoning
Somethin' that's deeply rooted in official embroidering
The difference? We went from water hoses to bullets
But the valve or trigger, just a different figure to pull it
Murdered by the state like the cousin of the John the Baptist
As if Black youths aren't nothing but target practice
Overindulgence of power, a monstrous binge
This creates anger, make me want to seek revenge
You invade our protests, guns and heavy armor
Riot shields and yielding a badge of dishonor
Just a disguised version of the KKK
Kops Killing Kids about seven a day

[Chorus]
Lead- lead- lead poisoning
Lead- lead- lead poisoning
Lead- lead- lead poisoning
Lead- lead- lead poisoning
Lead- lead- lead poisoning
Lead- lead- lead poisoning
It's lead poisoning
Rise
Rise
Rise
Rise

[Verse 2: RZA]
In all reality, Police Brutality cause too many casualties
It starts from the improper training, brainwashing of their faculty
Suppose to serve and protect, not disturb and disrespect
With six niggas on my Curb face down inside the projects
A long-term effect they done got on my community
They killed Little Bill but the badge gave them immunity
Rodney King caught a stampede on TV
Now they chokin' niggas out 'til he's like "I can't breathe"
I used to watch Starksky and Hutch and Baretta and Adam-12 and such
Dreamin' I could be a cop when I grow up
I would see you in my neighborhood and I would trust you
But now I understand why Eazy-E is like "fuck you!"

[Chorus]
Lead- lead- lead poisoning
Lead- lead- lead poisoning
Lead- lead- lead poisoning
Lead- lead- lead poisoning
Lead- lead- lead poisoning
Lead- lead- lead poisoning
It's lead poisoning
Rise
Rise
Rise
Rise
Rise
Rise
Rise
Rise
Rise like coyotes
Rise like coal blackened thunder
The fleet has left
While the admiral slumbered
Vigilante Nocturno
Test the chains
Gnaw the screws
We are many
They are few
