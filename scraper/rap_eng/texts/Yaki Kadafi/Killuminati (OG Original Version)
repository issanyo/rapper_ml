[Intro: 2Pac]
Makaveli the Don, break on 'em!
Ah put ya, ah put ya hands on ya, hands on ya heater
Hands on ya, hands on ya heater, hands on ya, hand…

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Let it be prophesized; niggas'll die because your crew's doom
Around the way niggas get murdered by the full moon
Heard it in whispered tones, niggas is bold and they choose to roll
I kill 'em all, watch now, nigga, truth be told
Westside was the war cry, look how they scatter
Niggas dyin' by my 30 odd, brains is splattered
Wonder why these niggas cross me, I'm certified crazy
So sick the world made me
Now diggy-die, every time I ride is for reasons
Hard to kill a nigga 'cause I'm comin' back like Jesus
Bow down to my ill nation, runnin' from drug cases
Lookin' at my congregation so full of thug faces
Mama gave a nigga breath, a life of stress
I invest in a vest and makin' niggas watch they every step
Label me a threat and I ain't even got started with this shit yet
Thug style, baby, hands on my pistol, listen
I'm a rider, every nigga breathin' pay attention
'Bout to show you motherfuckers how it feel to drop a body
A simple glimpse of my lifestyle, Killuminati…

[Chorus: (Kastro) & 2Pac]
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin' again
'Til I make it, yo, my military be prepared for them bustaz
Similar to bitches too scary, get too near me, we rushin'
Visions of over-packed prisons, millions of niggas thug livin'
Pressures and three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heat out, ammunition in crates
Psssh! Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
They got me fiendin' for currency, the money be callin'
It’s like I’m - dreamin', seein' scenes of me ballin'
Participated in felonious behavior
Cock the cocked 4-5, snatchin' niggas pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin' 40's, moved to harder shit
Goddamn, now I'm a grown man, I follow no man
Nigga got my own plan, and it's called Killuminati

[Chorus: (Kastro) & 2Pac]
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
Killuminati
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Amin]
Check it, I spend most of my time hatin' niggas
Wantin' to bank niggas, because they come across as fake niggas
But we made niggas, old school in our thinkin'
While you sinkin', I comes out, fucked up, high as hell, drinkin'
Outlawz could never be bullshitters, what
We keeps it too assassin, none of y'all can deal with us
Got me thinkin' who's still with us or who haters
It don't matter 'cause put together none of y'all could take us
Y'all don't understand, I'll kill for this nigga, peel for this nigga
And when y'all dump out, be the shield for this nigga
E.D.I. Amin, ooh, Lordy Lordy
Kill 'em all for shorty, '96, it's Killuminati

[Verse 4: Kadafi]
They got me thinkin' strugglin' and hustlin's my only fate
Toppin' grams on the kitchen plate
Tryin' to keep that money straight
Times is where I be up on these streets sleep
But when I crack, hammer cocked back, wrapped in my sheets
My life's been crossed, crooked since a seed
Thirteen, got a package from the devil, payin' my deeds
Preoccupied by the greed in this crooked life I lead
More funds to spend or bigger guns to squeeze
Me and my thugs clock G's, sippin' naughty thangs
Real as these tats on my body, and it's Killuminati

[Chorus: (Kastro) & 2Pac]
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)

[Outro: 2Pac]
Makaveli up in this bitch, worldwide mash, Westside
The question when asked, nigga, you know what time it is
You know what type of shit we giving you
You want that hip-hop, nigga, this that hip-hop for real
Hip-hop that sell five mill'
Fuck with me, nigga, you get killed
It don't get no realer than real
What's my motherfuckin' name, nigga? Like my nigga Dogg asked
What's my muh'fuckin name, nigga?
