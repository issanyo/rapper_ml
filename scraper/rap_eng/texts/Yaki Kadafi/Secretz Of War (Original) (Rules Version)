[Intro: 2Pac]
Secrets of war
Get your pen and pads out, you lil' young ass muthafuckas
Alright now, Fatal-n-Felony, you know what time it is
Kingpin Kurupt, with 'Pac
Put your hands on ya, hands ya
Get y'all niggas up
Roll with the secrets now
Secrets of war
Put your hands on ya, hands on ya
Time to roll with the secrets now
Secrets of war
Put your hands on ya, hands on ya
Peep it
Check it

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
My melody is music that's corrupt as a felony
Lethal weapon rebelling, so dope that niggas inhaling me, uh!
Like Sun Tzu or Machiavelli, the secrets of war
The art of combat, bustin' will never fail me
Now Rule 1: Follow yo' enemies and peep his weakness
Constitute while he's asleep and make the game deeper
Rule 2: Locate his crew, and peep the things they do
Now get some infra-red beams and waste them niggas too
Rule 3: Let's find a place where they rest they head
You jealous bastards make caskets out ya comfy beds
Rule 4: Now peep the secrets of war
I got surveillance on muthafuckas beware of my forty-four
Rule 5: Right before you bustas die
Let you look me inside my eyes say ya good-byees
Then Rule 6: Witness the death of a trick
He was a coward from day one, and died like a bitch, see BIIATCH
Hahahahahaha

[Hook: 2Pac]
We bust, if we must, plus we handle business
If you jealous niggas fuck with us
(you know what time it is)
Secrets of war
We bust if we must, plus we handle business
If you jealous niggas fuck with us
(Put your hands on ya, hands on ya)
Secrets of war

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
I diffuse troops with interviews and they metabolism
Sure mad and I'm snappin on rappers actin' they stacks is wit' 'em
Expose you like spades, who the fuck out they heart
I pull your projects apart and find more ism than narcs
We play parks and side streets, keepin' it 9 to 5 B
Last week plan is jump to 21 jump street
Poisonous led, spread ya legs on the rake
Or I'm gettin' mine feel about 29 that's sittin' on the ledge
This ain't the place to creep, so don't be practicin'
How to get my niggas on the block, when you think we sleep
No I don't think ya know our styles, you ain't got shit I wreck
Mechanic will have 'em empty like them 7th ave projects
You half way crooks, ya guys are scared to step foot and look fast
On the strength they can get hit up quick or their shit took fast
I smile, and I'll commitin' murder, money live
Pager 325, on some shit you never fuckin' heard of

[Hook: 2Pac]
Here we go, secrets of war
We bust if we must, plus, we handle business
If you jealous niggas fuck with us
Secrets of war (y'all know what time it is)
We bust if we must, plus, we handle business
If you jealous niggas fuck with us
(Put your hands on ya, hands on ya)

[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]
Nowadays with all these fast cash tendencies
Yo straight up, they got me lookin' eye to eye, with all my enemies
Spottin' almost plottin', claimin' to be a fuckin' friend of me
Triple connections, Two TECs sittin' shot gun up in the Lexus
Ready to release some ripples in a nigga mid-section
With bullets that's hollow, rules to follow crews get swallowed down wit' the clowns
Get drowned like deuce deuce bottles
We clique gettin' major, clappin' glasses, spittin' razors
It's insane how I live, it's unexplained cross behavior
Streets of war

[Hook: 2Pac]
We bust if we must, plus, we handle business
If you jealous niggas fuck with us
Secrets of war (y'all know what time it is)
We bust if we must, plus, we handle business
If you jealous niggas fuck with us
(Hands on ya, hands on ya)

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
I've seen it over, and over, no win sit-yay-tions
The end, the end of gladiations so now they facin' (uh)
They faced with metaphoric phrases hysteria (uh huh)
Engages the death toll to spread like malaria
What I can cock and stop thoughts from circulatin' through ya head
In the form of writer's block and spread like a plague (hm)
I break, batter and bruise neck, arms and legs
In my profession, my thoughts conceal weapons (uhh)
Gettin' ready to drop the bomb like the B-1
Ya 145 pound rhymes and mines a 3 ton
Concoctions, mystic can spot the gator
Before ya get a dosage of the greatest rhyme creator
In this existence relax and explore the scene
I get this shit pumped the fuck up like morphine
And uh, and uh, and uh

[Outro: 2Pac]
Hahahahehehehe, be-itch
Secrets of muthafuckin' war
(We bust, if we must, plus, jealous niggas fuck wit' us)
Y'all don't even understand it
(secrets of war, we bust if we must, plus, jealous niggas fuck wit' us)
Secrets of war
And all you lil' young ass souljahs
You play this shit back about 50 times
You'll have enough game to roll up to the club or somethin' (we thuggin' be-itch)
Teach these bitches a lil' somethin', you know what I mean?
Secrets of muthafuckin' war, live on Death Row, BITCH!
Hahahahahehehehehe
You niggas crazy
Well that was Kurupt
Fatal, Felony
And 'Pac
That nigga Johnny J on the beat so
You know it's thug life
