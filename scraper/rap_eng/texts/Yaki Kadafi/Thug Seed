[Verse 1: Yaki Kadafi]
What's up for '95? Yeah, '95 sound live!
From doin' crimes, no more runnin' from one-time
Although I know I role I gets for my title
When I was young, that nickel-plated Four-Fifth was my idol
Chrome, stones, bones, and portable phones
Getting' big hoes while I'm sittin' at home
Is what I scheme of, so NOW what I dream of
Is a life full of trouble, in fact
Countin' double digit stacks
Lay back for a minute, 400 SEL, yeah, I could see myself in it!
Murder for money, you ever heard of a dummy
With Glocks between his tummy, low down dirty and crummy
Talkin' bout that Thug Life be the only life I know
Talkin' bout that drug life without this rap shit
Probably be the only route I go
And matter of fact I know I'll strive through this fo sho

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
And screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villian, a young thug, who one day shall fall

[Verse 3: EDI]
Everday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
When I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well
