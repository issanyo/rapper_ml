[Verse 1]
Why don't you let me be your freak for the day
Literally and mentally you're nice to lay
Take advantage 'cause it usually ain't easy
I'm on my knees and I'm not about to pray (What you say?)
When you reach my door, just push it 'cause it's cracked
Already know you got the drink, I got the sack
Don't be late 'cause you know this is where it's at
And if my high goes down, then you ain't getting jack
So come on...

[Chorus]
If you want me, come on over, it's alright
One-time offer, so what you doing tonight?
If you want me, come on over, it's alright
One-time offer, so what you doing tonight?

[Verse 2]
It's been on men to have a drink or true make home
You can't trust many but now you shouldn't assume
3 o'clock in the afternoon, ooh, come make me sing
Let's ride-dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah
Not too quiet, baby, you can call me names
Make believe I'm some bitch named Jane
Just knock it out and I don't even know your name
Yes, I got your number, baby, what you doing next...

[Chorus]
If you want me, come on over, it's alright
One-time offer, so what you doing tonight?
If you want me, come on over, it's alright
One-time offer, so what you doing tonight?

[Verse 3]
Now if you wanna ride out, good to go
But if you wanna drive, I'll let you know
I like the kind of cars that ain't broke down or slow
Especially when I'm high...
I like it when you shift the stick, use cruise control
When you hit them switches, elevate and roll
You could even leave me on the side of the road
I'ma ride-dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah

[Chorus]
If you want me, come on over, it's alright
One-time offer, so what you doing tonight?
If you want me, come on over, it's alright
One-time offer, so what you doing tonight?
If you want me, come on over, it's alright
One-time offer, so what you doing tonight?
If you want me, come on over, it's alright
One-time offer, so what you doing tonight?
If you want me, come on over, it's alright
One-time offer, so what you doing tonight?
If you want me, come on over, it's alright
One-time offer, so what you doing tonight?
