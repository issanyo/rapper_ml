[Intro: 2Pac]
The police comin' nigga
Get out of there!

[Hook: 2Pac]
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride, get me high
They fucked up when they robbed me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride, get me high
They fucked up when they robbed me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep

[Verse 1: Napoleon]
Runnin' through these niggas like a runnin' back
With my Outlaw pack
Don’t make me handle your head, so I proceed
Young and learn how to act
We on the mad for this cash, I left some dead in the back
We leave 'em burnt in our path, we put them holes to they head
The game turned on ’em, we got the word, then we rolled on ’em
Did him so bad, he thought Jesus took his soul from ’em
We cold on ’em, told him we gon’ mash this way
S.O.S., shoot on sight, might take the pressure away

[Verse 2: Storm]
Yo, believe I'm a broad, breaking the front lawns
My army if you wit me, battle positions
They got the rookies holdin' quickly
Ride for me deep and dirty, copyin is sloppy
You got to drop me ‘fore stop me, push the crucial to lock me
Ain't a street that you Kadafi, with my mission beside
Born to die a thug soldier, still ridin for Pac
The war ain’t over, raise your guns high
They say it’s peace? That’s a lie
So my homies die, now tell me why?

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now ever since momma got fucked and papa ducked out
Look at us, murderous thugs showin' less love in the drug house
Similar to savages, it's a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin' damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash we flaunt it
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin' the war to the streets
Why fear me, fear the shit I speak
Once this shit drop it's heard on every fuckin' street
Like the sound of police
Who run the streets really?
In every hood legends grow
From the hustlaz up at Harlem to shot callers in O'
And though, Congress, don't want us to progress, we stressed
My homie buried at an early age, hustled to death
His last breath, a lesson I possess like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'

[Verse 4: Yaki Kadafi]
Heavyweight thugs don't budge when we stalk the streets
Sort of like chalk and narcotics when they walk the beat
You speak the beef pussy draw down and drop it
Hit you with 6 shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Gettin' mines with nine cocked extortin'
Blocks pop with 22's in my socks with the butt hangin' out the chocolate
You never seen time, I travel across dream crime
My rolls like a million dollar bill, folded with green lines
With my foes erased, drink my Henney straight no chasin'
Catch my body like cases, 5 minutes from the station

[Verse 5: Young Noble]
I hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
No finger prints that mean there was no evidence or proof that I was present
At the scene of the crime around 10 niggas bleed
After they made this punk fag motherfucker bleed
Money was bloody as shit, y’all niggas shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with, bow down on your knees shit
The Glock to your head nigga, don’t let inside action
Hit innocent by-standers when you blasted, shot fuckin backwards
Little homies puttin work for stripes
But is it worth your life, g-rides runnin red lights
I wish somebody would have told me then
Since I’m an outlaw like Napolean ain’t no cell they can hold me in
Caucasian, crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like some niggas fade me in
Havin’ the fiend’s page me
When they want the product nigga I got the smoke
Got the weed and the coke what you need what you want (coke, coke)
What you working with I’m on some immortal shit
Outlawz we straight hurtin shit use artillery to murder with
Put on the block gangsta party like Pac
Lifes hard from the OX me, and my niggas on top, top

[Bridge: 2Pac]
I know the law hate me dearly, comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E
I know the law hate me dearly, comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E
I know the law hate me dearly, they comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E
I know the law hate me dearly, they comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E

[Verse 5: Nuttso]
With my Glock, quick to let it pop, fuck the law
Carry steel cause I live on the nigga side of the law
Ridin' foes 'cause I can't let hoes catch me slippin'
Quick to blow and dispose if you block on hittin'
Ridin' high, blazin', kryptonite got a nigga dazin'
Burpin' and smurkin' got on enemies before I grave 'em
Ride 'em, look behind him, I see him, he slipped
Had to stop light in a slowly night, this motherfuckin' trick
Slide over so I can dump and put it in em
Damn, I guess this motherfucker know that I sent it
Hit the pedal now we high speedin'
With the metal tryin' to make these motherfuckers die speedin'
Up the way I seen him slow down
Shit!! I think I done bucked these hoes down
Caught them runnin' on e, it's kind of funny to me
They know they was fuckin' with me but they dumb to see

[Verse 6: 2Pac]
Open up fire watch 'em expire when my shells split 'em
Plus all them trick niggas basically can go to hell with 'em
Fuck 'em they phony claimin' they homies but they foes
Speakin' on thug niggas daily, while we nailin' they hoes
Explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
Words are known to spray blaze as I raise my thug nation
A crooked thought, cops get bought, no longer caught
Out on bail, raisin' hell, nigga fuck what you thought
Did you cry when my girl died?
Put out the hit, politic niggas worldwide, grabbin' my dick
I’ll never learn, take away the pain with sherm
Throwin' gas on my enemies watchin' 'em burn
Kamikaze, I’m shootin' up the casket take the body
Whip the corpse like a piñata and party
His last breath, a straight lesson I possess like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'
Runnin' on E..
Stay thugged out keep it movin'
Runnin' on E

[Outro:2Pac]
