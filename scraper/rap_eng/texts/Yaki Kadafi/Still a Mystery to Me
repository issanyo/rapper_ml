[Verse One: Bustop]
We movin, livin, dyin'---surrounded by cryin'
Funerals and lions
Theze projects, they keep a nigga, focused
Homiez goin--the other ones out roamin' like locusts
Y.G.'s on-one, G'z done had they day---so
We livin in the dayz of the ho's-dopefienes and wine-o's
Fuck that, this shit won't cease
And 2 my nigga makaveli---rest in peace

[Verse Two: Napoleon]
It ain't over cuz it's just gettin started
Tha world done made theze outlaw niggas cold hearted
Swervin down the light--talk to pac--he departed
Say bye-bye 2 a legend breed of outlaw
Is heaven full-of pleasure?

[Yaki Kadafi]
I see you... nigga I see you!!

[Napoleon]
This mac-11 cocked back--retaliation--whatch thatt
Gonna get your moms ass back
Ain't no tellin when we gonna strike
Hiz game iz on me--told me how 2 play my cards and keep it goin
Set em' up, then we cutt em' up, there body missin, knowone knowin
Evidence showin', who the fuk gonna care!?
I swear I told 'pac--if he died, nigga I'mma ride 4 em',---and so, YEA
They see me breathin, this makaveli blood iz what I'm bleedin
Satan-lucifer-napoleon--iz mixed with jesus
It's thatt--and it's evil--but the other good-itz 4 my people
I'mma ride till they burn my insydes witta desert eagle

[Verse Three: Kurupt]
Oh-no this can't be,another day another destiny
Constantly bless me-tha upper level in the quest 2 be
Others address me, I'm tryin 2 live like (some dude)
Focus like a arrow--hold casino's like daniro
Bring the heat nigga, I keeps it hotta
'Pac the rawest ridah, he don't live in silence nigga he live insyde us
4ever in a week and a half-15 yearz,century 2 century--
Tha row trilogy verbally ridin...4 'pac nigga

[Napoleon]
"God bless the dead"

[Hook: Yaki Kadafi]
Tell me y do we live this life a pain?
Lost souls stuk addicted like crack-headz 2 this game
Jail-houses and gun-shots puttin pressure on my brain
Whether it's crews or gangs we claim
This shit ain't never gonna change

[Verse Four: Flip Side]
Lord I never understood y we wuz born 2 die
If it's a part of life thenn y do we still cry??
When we see your loved one's being buried
In the whole that they dugg at the cemetary
Whatchin the mother cry iz the worst of all
When see she her baby putt in that bolted wall
And they say that theres no-way that I could question god
So make progress in pieces it what ask the lord

[Verse Five: EDI]
Now when I close my eyez I enjoy the darkness
Theze hardships sit way 2 deep, and make me wanna stay 'sleep
I remember the dayz we used 2, ride 2gether
We wuz gone on 1--I thought we would, die 2gether
Now place my soul in a whole--thats a million feet deep
Physical frame only remains, 4 all y'all 2 tweek
Mann I'm as hollow az theze points in lil' mu's G--lock
On the quest 4 death and ain't gonna stop till I see-'PAC

[Yaki Kadafi]
"Comin soon!"

[Hook: Yaki Kadafi]

[Verse Six: Low M.B]
I done gave all I can ain't no tearz left
Cuz everytime I look around we got another death
It wuz hard losin'pac now kadafi iz gone
Don't worry about us homiez we gonna be strong
But the mystery the mysery iz hurtin us inyde
Say a prayer-hit the weed--grab our pistols and ride
So what we gonna do?-we gonna ride or die
La,lah,la,lala,lah-law

[Verse Seven: Storm]
Tearz 4 my pearz, speakin--hope they hear me
2Pac I miss u dearly
Soldier 4 u're legacy--deepin u're spirit
Picked up the flag carr'd on the mission
By any meens-im seein visions threw my darkest wishes
Beggin yuh--rest in peace
Kadafi if u hear me--, copy??
Iz there a heaven 4 souls with thug tatted bodies
Killuminati got me questionin my survival
Will I rize?-will I die?
Borrowed 2morrows got me rushin the prize the prize

[Hook & Outro Yaki Kadafi]
Tell me y do we live this life a pain?
Lost souls stuk addicted like crack-headz 2 this game
Jail-houses and gun-shots puttin pressure on my brain
Whether it's crews or gangs we claim
This shitt ain't never gonna change...

"Nigga--outlawz, thug life, west side, till we die
Fuck all u fag-its, don't gotta ask y"

[Kastro]
Ridin wit him--black jesus!
