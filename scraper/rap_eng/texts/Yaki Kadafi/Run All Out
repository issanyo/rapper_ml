[2Pac]
Us, the first to bust, who do we trust...

No matter what I do, they got a nigga
Still runnin' from the police
(Put them motherfuckin' Nike's on tight and get ghost y'all)

[Verse 1: Yaki Kadafi]
I ain't got nuttin on my mind, but gettin' in some trouble
Lickin' shots to they block leavin' bloody blood puddles
For some ridah delight, now we in a gunfight
I can shoot the gauge pebbles at the devils or die tonight
It's on me, but if I die bury me a motherfuckin' G
A open casket on them bastards so they all remember me
With my vest on my chest, my tools and my piece
Thug Life motherfucker gotta me runnin' from the police

[Hook: 2Pac]
I know the law hate me dearly, comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on e
I know the law hate me dearly, comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on e

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
Halfway thugs are buged when we stalk the streets
Sort of like thugs and narcotics when we walk the streets
You speak the big pussy throw down and drop it
Hit you with six shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Gettin' mine with nine coked extortin'
Block shots with 22's with my socks with the butt hangin' out the chalk
You never seen time I travel across the mean crime
My rolls like a million dollar bills folded in green slime
With my foes erased drink my henney straight no chasin'
Catch my body like haitian five minutes from the station

[2Pac]
We Going All Out!

[Chorus: 2Pac]

[2Pac]
We Going All Out!

[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]
Big money, clutch and bail, to murder em, hand pulse rushin'
Cap tiled to the side, on the lean, out the ride, bustin'
Outlawz in force, secrets of war, but won't abuse it
Burn and bury my burners with my dead buddies when I use it
Give a fuck about later, shots swarm to the equator
Death to u traders, shots bitin' through your bones like alligator
Payin' my dues, lookin' for miscellaneous infamous crews
Old lady sing the blues, leave em smokin' from they shoes

[Hook: 2Pac]
I know the law hate me dearly, comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on e
I know the law hate me dearly, comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on e
