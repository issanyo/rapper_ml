[Intro: 2Pac + (Kadafi) + Val Young]
Searchin' for Black Jesus
Oh yeah, sportin' jewels and shit, yaknahmean?
(You can be Christian)
Straight tatted up
(Baptist, Jehovah Witness) No doubt
(Islamic) No doubt (Doesn't matter to me, I'm a thug)
(Thugs, we praise Black Jesus, all day)
Young Kadafi in this bitch, set it off, nigga...

We believed in you
For everything you do
Just wanna let you know how we feel
Black Jesus

[Verse 1: Kadafi]
I do my shootings on a knob, prayin' to God for my squad
Stuck in a nightmare, hopin' he might care
Though times is hard, up against all odds, I play my cards
Like I'm jailin', shots hittin' up my spot like midnight rains hailin'
Got me bailin' to stash more green guys
Ain't tryin' to be trapped on no block
Slangin' them rocks like bean pies
Brainstorm on the beginnin'
Wonder how shit like the Qu'ran and the Bible was written
What is religion?
God's words or a curse like crack?
Shai-tan's way of gettin' us back
Or just another one of my Black Jesus' traps

[Verse 2: Storm]
Who's got the heart to stand beside me?
I feel my enemies creepin' up in silence
Dark prayers, scream violence - demons all around me
Can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; Black Jesus
Give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
'Cause I swear, they tryin' to break my well
I'm on the edge lookin' down at this bottomless pit
Will it matter if I cease to exist? Black Jesus

[Chorus: 2Pac]
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Submissive souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus, hahahaha
He's like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus

[Verse 3: Hussein Fatal]
Stick-ups, rob past niggas with trigger hiccups
Bodybag you punk pickups when these niggas go put they shit up
Nine-and-a-half out of ten, shorty be twistin' they wrists in cuffs
And for hustlin', go ride on the block with cop Glocks bustin'
They thinkin' that it's funny to kill for real
Plus gettin' twenty 20 bills, twenty minutes makin' money still
Patrollers be rollin' tryna hold us and haunt us
All swooped up and on us, 'cause we groupin' up on corners
My Black easy Jesus, please somebody feed us
I'm shootin', startin' a revolution with my kids
My cell block, whatever, held rock but never
Too close to the sword, he got jail dropped forever, Black Jesus

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
To this clique I'm dedicated, criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
Made for terror, major league niggas pray together
Bitches in they grave while my real niggas play together
We die clutchin' glasses, filled with liquor bomblastic
Cremated, last wish is niggas smoke my ashes
High sigh why die wishin', hopin' for possibilities
I'll mob on, while they copy me sloppily
Cops patrol projects, hate the people livin' in them
I was born an inmate, waitin' to escape the prison
Went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous
Blast 'til they holy high; baptize they evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine, trick
Which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?
Bitches freeze facin' Black Jesus

[Chorus: 2Pac]
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Submissive souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus

[Verse 5: Kastro]
Some say, one day
Some day, some how
Some way we gon' fail
Either six ditches or twelve
Just stick us and leave us in jail
Oh well, I bail, blazed out drunk as hell
Waitin' to fade, 'cause Black Jesus see
Just how this world treat His seeds, His young
Beat us 'til we dumb for fun, why run
When the outcome don’t do me justice in the long run
So I say, "Fuck this whole world, bitch," breathless
Time is tickin', our minds clickin', 'til we blackout
Goin' all out, overboard route for clout
And Black Jesus come and save our seeds 'cause we need you
All play by the same to see us, Black Jesus

[Outro: Val Young]​
We believed in you
For everything you do
Just wanna let you know how we feel
Black Jesus
We believed in you
For everything you do
Just wanna let you know what you mean
Black Jesus
We believed in you
For everything that you do
Just wanna let you know how we feel
Black Jesus
