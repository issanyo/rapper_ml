Mutah
Said you love beating bitches live
K-Dog
On the real gettin' high
Label us the young thugs
Niggas leave with much mail
Fuck hoes, fuck the law, and fuck jail
Young niggas never had a prayer to prevail
These killing fields can be hell

[Verse 1: Edi Mean]
[?] complicated, we grew up crime related
From watchin' them old folks smoke dope, yo it left us faded
But on the killing fields, as real as some niggas chill
Realize and recognizin', you survive if you got bigger steel
Then it was only a minute 'til our time was coming
Yo it was at the point don't have no run ins with those fucking youngins
See all the grown ups was dead or smoked up
Left with no game to soak up, we said fuck it and loc'd up
Back to the street [?], and to make beats
But then there those who'd be rich if we didn't did it
Murder but ain't nobody feel us still now it's too late
We ain't nothing but bait for them killin' fields

[Hook]
Gotta keep my eyes on the steel
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is
Gotta keep my eyes on the steel
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is

[Verse 2: K-Dogg]
I came through lookin' up to, who?
The high rollers, with the gold chains that's call as eye's swolers
But now as I look back and think about my wishes
Seeing them same killin' niggas turn to snitches
So I stay high and suspicious
For these steels can get real fuckin' vicious
I know you feel me
If you nigga how you can't
I'm gettin' hot and lick a shot when I'm amped
And I ain't got nothing on my mind but my riches
Bury me a g, ain't got time for no bitches (biatch)
Thinkin' they fuckin' with a nigga on heels
Baby I must keep it real, for my niggas on these killin' fields

[Hook]
Gotta keep my eyes on the steel
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is
Gotta keep my eyes on the steel
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is

[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]
Now I can get through this, ain't nothing to this
Matter of fact many if not plenty more, muthafuckas be alive
If they knew this, I keeps my shit wicked
Throw your hands in the muthafuckin' air as I kick it
Tryin' to see a meal ticket before I'm gone
Papa never got the chance to tell me it was on
But now I'm torn
Trapped between the devils curse and a hearse
Left with nothing but childhood pictures in my grandmama's purse
Now I strap up for the showdown
Grab my four pound and some more rounds
Bet these thugs would love to slug, so get low down
Words can't express how I feel for my steel
On these muthafuckin' killin' fields

[Hook]
Gotta keep my eyes on the steel
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is
Gotta keep my eyes on the steel
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is

[Verse 4: Napoleon]
Nigga you better duck when I run up
And throw your fuckin' gun up
Or be the next nigga to get tore up
Static is what they starting, money is what I'm hoggin'
Blacked as fuck, somebody better start talking
Best to believe I will bury ya, or be the next nigga
To be dead in your area, I'm scarier
Ain't nothing spooky about this shit here
Truth'll be the vivid living now you got to pay your bitch
Playa, I carry down strap with all my niggas
Best to believe, I'm yelling thug life when I pull the trigger
I throw your lights when I blast
I tear a hole in your ass, fucking hole in your ass

[Hook]
Gotta keep my eyes on the steal
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is
Gotta keep my eyes on the steal
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is
