[Intro: Kutt Calhoun]
It's still real out here, niggas
Niggas is still active through these streets, man
I had to call upon my nigga from Sac-town
816 to the 916
Yo Spidey!

[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung]
No matter what set you bangin', nigga, better get it right
Better not be light 'cause niggas is out there for your life
Don't believe it, that's your problem, time to solve it
You can be the shooter, I be the one to get your jaw split
No matter what set you bangin', nigga, better get it right
Better not be light 'cause niggas is out there for your life
Don't believe it, that's your problem, time to solve it
You can be the shooter, I be the one to get your jaw split

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm from where most people hardly reach adulthood
Poverty stricken vultures, look odd and they go approach you
Obviously a notion to rob you of what you holdin'
Probably be them soldiers, can't spot 'em 'cause they cloakin', scopin
In them 501s, hawkin
Them red bandanas, fallin
Out the right side of them pockets
These niggas is bangin so watch it
You know them 5’s is poppin
And they say them 6’s is droppin
In Kansas City, no problem
To lift a nigga up with his choppin
When bullets flyin, they gone
If you ain't 'bout it, stay home
First 48 with no snitchin' niggas get split when they run
Miss in your face now it's caution tape all in front of they home
Thanks to the street the next time they see you's at Laurs and St. Jones
With the rest of your relatives situations'll never get
Cool with time
Especially if you rep to the death of it
See them boys in that denim, them 51s be the reckonin'
In the reality maybe a little crazy but definitely all [?]

[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung]
No matter what set you bangin', nigga, better get it right

You can be the shooter, I be the one to get your jaw split
No matter what set you bangin', nigga, better get it right
Better not be light 'cause niggas is out there for your life
Don't believe it, that's your problem, time to solve it

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
We get the bullshit - 501 in this hood shit
Hoodies for Trayvon Martin, these APBs and the dueces
You youngin niggas is stupid, so clueless to what you doin
Get out of it while you can, find a life to live and pursue it
It's nothin' to glorify when your homie is chopped in two and
You gotta make up a lie so his family won't be in ruins
Niggas they been through it before you, know the end of the story
Ain't no fame in this business, pour out some liquor to mourn you
Homicide on the daily, see your best friends in the paper
Obituaries and memories got a ride for the later
Ain't nobody alive so the babies
Grow up avengeful and now you got genocide in the makin'
It's a cycle, we all assault our rifles with us
Wanna be MJ, and that's just how we all endin' up
Dead too soon, before our time, we had to go
Ain't no escapin' the inevitable so, that's all we know

[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung]
No matter what set you bangin', nigga, better get it right

No matter what set you bangin', nigga, better get it right
Better not be light 'cause niggas is out there for your life
Don't believe it, that's your problem, time to solve it
You can be the shooter, I be the one to get your jaw split
