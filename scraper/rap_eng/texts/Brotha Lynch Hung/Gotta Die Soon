Well fuck you too

With a murder on my shoulders
Now I'm a straight O.G

I know I gotta die soon anyway
Fuckin wit me I have you bustin niggas any day
Duckin the heat
Yeah that's how I gotta be
With a murder on my shoulders
Now I'm a straight O.G

I couldn't trust a nigga in my family
So how the fuck you think I could trust you
You don't understand me
I got problems too, my mama just died
And I can't stop drinkin on O.E
And I'm predicting my death
My guts is bleeding, I can feel it in me
I don't want no body at my funeral
So fuck you fake ass bitches
Cause all you wanted was my riches
I wasn't even rich
I made you think that
I was with a fucked up record company
But now I'm right back
Its all siccmade music though, that's how Paul made it
So fuck blackmarket
But shouts to X- raided
Nigga we go way back
Fate will keep us apart
I don't give a fuck what them niggas are telling you
Nigga, you in my heart
And I hope I'm in yours
But if I'm not, Damn
Just another relationship in the frying pan
I gotta
Expand the plans seperate from the haters
But if you ever in my town hit me up when you touch down
So many niggas been waitin to drop
Half of em talkin dirty about your rip gut up partna
Funk startin up for nothin, no lovin
Shit, the heat is in the oven
If you ready to cook somethin don't make me have to hook somethin
For mean muggin
Cause niggas flip quicker than bombs at you
You on me one minute and the next they flipping hate in their sentences
But that ain't gonna get you no scratchola
Because the worlds cold like the polar
You can get your bullet proof coat or you can get tore up

Well fuck you too
Shit I know I gotta die soon anyway
Fucking with me
I have you bustin niggas any day
Duckin the heat
Yeah that's how its gotta be
With a murder on my shoulders
Now I'm a straight O.G

I paid for my own mama's funeral
I know you don't give a fuck
I just felt that you should know
When you supporting me, just the know the shit I spit is real
And if I was to kill, you can have this on cd so you can know the fucking deal
From '91 to 2 mil
All I knew was siccmade
Nobody wanted to kick it then
So all I could do was get paid
Dropped a couple tapes and I had to change up
Niggas threw a curve in the game
And the game got stranger
But I be the re-arranger
Call me yo homie then yo stranger
Hit em up wit one finger
One thumb, never high anger
And the thing was mother fuckers didn't love me
See me in the streets and it could get ugly
Like the inside of an ass crack
IS that real beef or can we move passed that?
I'll be the last dragon
Pants saggin
Magnum in the black cat
For these niggas because they faulty like dreamcast
Get dumped in the casket
Now I don fucked my whole career up
Because the millimeter blasted
But I put them out the fastest
And that's real
That shit spill bloody molasses
Dump slugs out to coup de ville
Because me and my homie really don't give a fuck
We peel yourself if we got to
Drop you
Way down in the cut
Where niggas can forget all about you
Doubt you
Feel you can touch me anyway nigga
You better stay wit about 50 pounds of heat a day nigga
And all them niggas that hate
You know they envy you
I wouldn't have learned it but its obvious
You know this niggas don't wanna squab wit us
Puff them up like puffy stuff
That's definite
Pull the trigger
Leaving nothing left
Then clean up your whole set with it
The block is gonna represent
That's why I'm throwing up the double c's

You talking about fuck me nigga
Well fuck you too
Shit I know I gotta die soon anyway
Fucking with me I have you bustin niggas any day
Duckin the heat
