Grrr, siccem! (Deuce-four, Deuce four)

[Verse 1 - Brotha Lynch Hung]
They call me Mr. Siccaluffagus
Quick to yell out "fuck a bitch!"
Thinkin' nigga quick stuck 'em
With the situation I tuck a 'fifth
Ready to straight up cut the skin off
I'm a little off, see they lame, brains hang out
Insane gang stranged out
I'm sicc of this, I'mma get venomous
Insinamous? dem fangs hang out
Insane in the brained out, no thang stangs ever came out
Split your liver, you better get your kids, upgrade the house
With samurais, turn the whole family into eggs and chowder
I'm so crazy 'bout her, I call her my switchbitch
Stick it up in you, taking out your insides
Put the rest in the ditch quick
I'mma eat like Hannibal, cannibal, wild bill shit
Having a nigga bust melodies, yelling like Johnny Gillshit
I'm a new addition to Strange, we about to kill shit
Yeah we all sicc in the brain, no major record deal shit
Yeah, we all carry the thangs, plastic and steel shit
Put it up in your veins and find it nigga, we will siccem!

[Verse 3 - G-Macc]
I can't welcome you to the nightmare
The nightmare is me
I put the knife right there
Most evil dream you ever seen
Especially when I run up on them with the Heckler-thing
Escalate the whole label-to-label beef 280 degrees
Y'all wanna see a dead body?
Twitter follow me
And I'm back to the dungeon
About to put one in the hostages
Chop 'em in threes
Top in the TV-news
Pullin' out the pockets
Pullin' out esophagus
24 street blue, shout outs to Lin Dog
Creeping through ninja court with the heat
Me and ???
Keep the automatic heated up like oven pilots
See no evil
And while motherfuckers take music shots
At me I got the semi locked and loaded
Put 'em in the butcher shop
Forget the mopping up all the blood
And getaway, escape from the parking lot
The clip - empty it out and run!
Back to the save haven and stop
Murder with tinker shit in my tape-deck
Then I wrap them up in latex like it's safe sex
I'll stab and stick em
