[Hook]
I dont give a fuck about what you think
I dont give a fuck about what you feel
Drop that album how the truth feels
Crack that yack bitch pop that pill
Or rock that steel
Sitting in a cage I got an appetite to crack and pop that still
And pop that veal
Yall mothafuckers is not that real
I'm a nutt bagg

[Verse 1]
I'm a gut bag em up and toe tag em
Kick like Enter the Dragon dont agonize me
Put rat poison up into my I.V
Try me
Took rap niggas right to the crime scene
I'm a crime scene maker, life taker
Take em on the stage and rape them no apron
I'm scrape his face and face satan
I'mma take his place and get a
Jason
Mask better be ready to duck fast
Never be ready to face me I cut grass
Leaving them dead, I put 3 in his head
And then I feed him to dead and proceed to cut stab
I ain't need to flip it I spit sick
Got syphilistic your bitch get licked
I'm telling you this is the sickness shit
I'm smelling you this shit can get twisted
I' in a rage, I didn't get paid now my life is stuck in a cage
I stay with the same Glock and the gauge
My lifes burnin im turnin the page
Anybody who face me I get em filleted
Laid in the shade with a bag o naze
I spit sicker than a bag of AIDs
About to blow back up so I have grenades
Get sick to this get a butcher knife
Slit ya bitches wrist now ya took her life
In a 56 and a hooker light
Your bitch is with me tell her good night
I'm 51 51 50
Don't get the hung, lick
Your going to get lit dont sit too rich
Lynch is going to get it
Going to get to this quick I spit liquid
They call me the nuttbag

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'mma put average niggas up in the attic
Take dead bitches and stab em up in the abdomen
Leaving bodies on Madison Avenue I'm having you
For dinner and a movie after I stab at you
You got a bit of the sickness nigga haven't you
Its like cocaine so I ain't got an attitude
Bada bing bada boom I'm in ya room and all I wanna do is
Sing another tune and bring another tool and bring another who?
Get cut up what up shit nutt up wit us get fucked up with us
Or don't fuck with us
Get cut up the butt kick shut up ya butt slit
Razor blade you todays the day cuz you paved the way for 2 days to
Get ate up
Shave his legs and tooth paste get blazed up
Eat his brains and put flames in they guts
Emeril Lagasse your posse you don't see what I see you're not me
With this shit I'mma get my monopoly
Not even a freight train can stop me
Not even the straight cane can rock me
Use weed to maintain a top speed
Low down to slow down with the four pound
Oh now you go now
I'm in a rage, I didn't get paid, now my life is stuck in a cage
I stay with the same Glock and the gauge
My life's burnin' I'm turning the page
Anybody who face me I get em filleted
Laid in the shade with a bag o naze
I spit sicker than a bag of AIDS
About to blow back up so I have grenades
