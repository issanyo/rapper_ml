[Zigg Zagg speaking]
Da Argument
The Argument number two

[Zigg Zagg]
And where was you last night
You know I hit you 'bout like one o'clock
And if you don't know by now, you put me on the spot
I'm fed up, shit, tired, sick and I can't even breathe
'Bout to put myself in prison and do you off in yo sleep
What was you thinkin?
You smell like stank ass bitch right now
What was you drankin?
Don't apologize, I'm packin up for a while
I can't believe it you given away a whole zip for a dub
And to the ho you spent the night wit
Hide
Cause push comes to shove
Blood runs much thicker than water, but don't wash
Next time you feelin sad and look over at me, I don't talk
Two kids and twelve years, but still I can't get the respect
This whole relationship thing to me is like a comedy act
You keep complainin at me night after night
I'ma leave and you be framin me wit all dis bullshit
I just can't breathe
And you be blamin me for what you be doin
I'm leavin please don't try to call me on my personal time
That's what I mean

[Brotha Lynch]
It's like therapy
See you can sit there and stare at me
You can even smell me
Go 'head you can tell me
Only time you see me get jealous is when you fuckin up
I trust you 'round the fellas
Better toughin up
Or get tossed up, this ain't no soap opera
This ain't O.J. & Nee-Cole
Creep up and pop ya, smashin in the Bronco
End up getting locked up
Run up to the enemy and he end up getting socked up
I ain't got no money for Cochran, no matter what you talkin
Don't make come at you with the glocked in like McGlockton
I smoke to much weed and they gon' take my kids
I'ma have to make you bleed, I can't let you live
Makin dem baby mama ribs after all these years
You didn't know it, I was a psycho killin wit all these tears
Blood type O, cryin when I killin
Huggin my babies and now I'm cryin when I'm killin
Jeah

[Chorus]
(Voice of the Bride of Chucky)
Um, you don't know me, but a few years ago I killed your husband, and I am so very very sorry
(Lady crying) - What is this some kinda of sick joke
(Voice of the Bride of Chucky)
Oh no, I'm completely serious!
(Lady cries)
(Voice of the Bride of Chucky)
I feel better already!

[Zigg Zagg]
A damn shame it's been a waist of my lifetime
I cry myself to sleep when you come back so late at night
I got no feelin for you sometimes
Can't lie, but wouldn't mind pullin the chain
So just maybe I that I might just shoot one off into the brain
51/50 you made it so likely nothin could matter
These bitches hittin you at 3 in the A.M. and what they after
I'm vicious and my patience is low, tryin to let you know
So don't come lookin for me after the show
You heard me beggin, and just this one last time
Show you what you about to be missin, I'm on a mission
When you hit from behind, you get the vision
Baby stickin 'em and thinkin' you fine
But just you listen, cause I'm shinin' baby commitin a crime
And man you slippin

[Brotha Lynch]
Everytime I come home, same ole shit
You ain't satisfied until I leave ya anal split
I know you ain't gon' get it until I ram it down ya throat
I know you ain't gon' lick it, I know you ain't gon' choke
But I'ma hit the G note, and that's gon' settle thangs
And you can leave broke, leave those metal thangs up out that shit
Unless somebody come trip, then I'll rock that shit
That's on Crip
Don't make me act so stiff, I'm a NWA
I was in trouble yesterday, and in trouble today
And it ain't gon' change, I spray thangs
So baby don't say thangs, 'bout to make it bang

[Chorus]
