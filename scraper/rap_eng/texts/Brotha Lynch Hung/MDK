[Intro]
Murder, death, kill, we hungry
Murder, death, kill, we hungry

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
And I got bodies in the trunk, some of that cayenne pepper
Midnight just passed, better keep your eyes on Lector
I'm hidin' in your closet with a machete and trash bags
Spaghetti your insides, get ready, I been died
Dead like a zombie
Backpack full of that crack that'll make you go hug mommy
Mo' drugs on me
I'm too nice, but don't make me get that butcher knife cause I do slice
Television say I'm a monster, they look at me like I'm Ed Gein, guts in a box, red sin
And givin' bitches head drama, I'm way worse
I scrape the skin off your back and make a human skin purse
Cuttin' this meat, Strange is invited to eat

[Hook] (x2)
Murder, death, kill, we hungry
Murder, death, kill, we hungry
Murder, death, kill, we hungry
Murder, death, kill, we hungry

[Verse 2: Trizz]
Ey, Lynch, is that a blunt? Roll that
Lace it with the cocaine, a nigga need to smoke that
Forgot to take my Prozac, I'm tryin' to get my zone back
Shakin' and twitchin', ready to kill a nigga, oh snap!
I feel alone to myself, so depressing
Stressed out, hectic, come close and get yo' neck slit
Reckless, rippin' shit out and give it as the message
Guts on your doorstep, wake ya up for breakfast
Send it out to Lynch for Dinner and a movie
Had the cops confused when they investigate, who, me?
Fuck jail, them niggas gon' have to shoot me
Goin' down fightin' on trial if they sue me
Fire up this doobie, spit a bloody loogie
Ripguts, look what drugs do to me
Somebody better save ya, sodomize and rape ya
Bitch, pick your face up and hand it to the strangla

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Watching a bitch scream, yeah, buddy, it wasn't as bloody as it seems
When it come to killing I'm a motherfucking fiend
Catch me in the corner with ya mother sucking spleen
Bath salt nigga, I pound the asphalt nigga
Wrap you up in duck tape and put you in the bottom of the river
But this time I was sniffin' cocaine
Suicidal, 12 gauge pointed at my head
Kurt Cobain
What you watchin, get em up, got em up
Shit you talkin, Shit em up, cut em up
I be havin' bad dreams and I want brains
And Im bout to rape your daughter I am insane
A midnight killer, like it's a fucking video game
And I need my own show cause I be cookin the game up
Like saute, all they, crew Wolf Gang Puck
Im rapin and fuckin the beat nigga gang fuck
Cuttin this meat Trizz is invited to eat

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 4: Trizz]
I hope you got my plate ready cause it's time to eat
Clean all the blood of my face, now its time to sleep
Move quick with the swift, Im a fuckin ghost
Treat bitches like my weed get chocked and smoked
Fuck my ex's, cause I done been played twice
Now Im trying to cut up those bitches usin my steak knife
Take the A-1 sauce and pour it on their ass
Light a match, set it off,fire up the gas
Have my new bitch join us for dinner
Tell Lynch to call this girl now we all up in her
Rip shit, grip shit, nigga this the siccness
For instance I kill bitches for attention
My idea of fun is fuckin dead bodies
The devils inside me, this motherfucker's hidin
Satan's takin over me, God whats gotten over me
I hope my angels dont leave, who else is gunna roll with me?

[Hook] (x2)
