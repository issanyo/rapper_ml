No
Sit in that fuckin' corner bitch
(No just sit in that fuckin' corner and shut the fuck up Bitch)
Should've kept you off the internet
Just sit in that fuckin' corner bitch
Shut the fuck up

[Verse 1]
Razorblade to nipples, baby breastfeed me
I just saw your face on the TV (look at that) and they already think you're laying six feet deep
Took a nap, now they on the news talking 'bout how they want their hooker back
I gave her back to 'em, but not before I took a bat, bashed her in the head
Bathed in it, played in it and smashed in the shev back to the hideout
Shit, I took a machete and dug her fucking eyes out
Now I'm on the internet, motherfucker why not?
MySpace is my place; pick her up and tie knots
Got her on the bed playing dead, fuck it then I took her to the bathtub
And made her bloody red, no matter what he said
Nigga, he's the ripper, I saw him slice a nigga's dick up
And cut a nigga's bitch up, put her in the trash bag and that's that
He's on Facebook, she's in the space look

[Hook]
Sit in that fucking corner bitch!
(Where's my motherfucking razorblade)
(Hey, I'm telling you bitch, you better take me serious)
Sit in that corner bitch!
(Remember when you got that computer for Christmas?)
(Yeah that's why you're here)
Sit in that fucking corner bitch
[Shouldve told em you wanted some Christian louboutin]
Sit in that corner bitch
(Now I'm about to cut you, and eat you and heat you and beat you bitch)

[Verse 2]
She asked me for a cigarette, here you go bitch back
First, pull out your titties and I promise I can get you wet
After I slit your neck, I keep 'em brainwashed, cut open the score
Cold while they get their brains washed
I'm in the kitchen with an Ithica ripping your bitches spliffining
And bitchin to get you to split the guts
Outta my mouth, I'm a get that outta my house
By cooking it and eating it and shitting it out
I can do mc, he won't find shit all in the couch
Shit in the bathroom and shit in the mouth
And razorblades and alcohol, shit in the pouch
Like 50 bitches on periods, I'm serious now
It's about to take 3 hours like hand paws
Trust me I'm tryna eat all them kids and the damn dog
I don't want ransom I'm sicker than Charles Manson, Ansem
Like Chuckie I'm cutting your butt cheeks

[Hook]
Sit in that fucking corner bitch!
(Yes, it's just about an hour left before dinner, you wanna watch a movie?)
Sit in that corner bitch!
(Instead of popcorn, I got popcorn alligator, you want some?)
Sit in that fucking corner bitch!
(Okay, well uhm, I gotta piss, so um, you need something to drink?)
Sit in that corner bitch!
(I also got diarrhea too, so uh, you want a milkshake?)
