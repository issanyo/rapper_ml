[Verse 1 - Brotha Lynch Hung]
I'm a Sacramento hall of famer, Picasso, a body breaker
Run up on me, homie, that's more meat for me
I ain't even tripping, I'm shitting without the toilet paper
Y'all niggas better shit quick, y'all niggas is loyal haters
Kobe Bryant of rap, don't worry about me or the Lakers
My shit is real shit, y'all niggas is sorta fakers
I be swinging them haymakers, and I may break them in half
Like eggshells, leave his brains on the plate, well
He thin in the brain, I stay locc to the brain
Sick in the brain, like I got coke on the brain
Stuck a nine in his ass, he came, little bitch
I'mma grind when it come to this game, I don't switch
I'm a Crip for life, drinking kryptonite
The bud, ice and [?] make me trip tonight
Now I'm back on the block, and I'm spitting the ice
Leave your body cold, maric√≥n, get this right

[Hook - MC Eiht]
All I ever wanted to be was a rider
Gat in my waist, a 64 slider
G's up in my town
Neighborhood boyz, we don't back down

[Verse 2 - MC Eiht]
I was a +menace+ in the hood way before the movie
On the blue beach cruiser in the hood with an uzi
Nicknamed "Tight Locc" 'cuz I was tight with the snaps
Spit a few gang tales, now I'm tight with my raps
And their caps get peeled, I'm clutching the steering wheel
Bumping something that these hood niggas definitely feel
All day on point, they bang this joint
Graveyard or the pen, it's easy to get in
My homie Jayo told me, "Eiht, they lied to you
No tales in the hood about what they do"
And I knew their mark asses first time I spot them
First time I run across them, first time I shot them
Did I ever pull a trigger? Fool, I plead the fifth
Assault history with a body laid stiff
And they welcome me back, but I'm not like Ma$e
But I'm back in the hood shooting niggas in the face
Gyeah!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Brotha Lynch Hung]
Hey, hey, I got the uzi
And my nigga Eiht got something like out of a Vietnam movie
The west side, home of the Oakland Raiders
But I'm a cowboy like C-Bo, rolling scrapers
I'm a hustler, doing them dirty with magazines
Smashing off rolling, eyes looking like Japanese
Stacking enemies like I'm stacking Gs
Black hat, strap, knapsack, black Chevy Caprice
