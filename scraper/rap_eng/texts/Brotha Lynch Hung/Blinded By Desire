[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]

I know she used to love me, had a niggas back
Here it comes, bad luck swooping like a black bat
I stay paranoid couldn't even trust my homies
They felt it, started acting like they don't know me
But I am me and I'mma always keep pushing
Little by little I learned that I don't need a cushion
Now I'm on stage and everybody is lookin'
I'm on my own page and everybody looks like cooked meat
524 miles to SoCal
And if you didn't know, I bet you you know now
I don't give a fuck about threats I got a blouw
Eighteen Teflon bullets under this towel
Cause I am me and I'mma just keep bustin'
Run up on a nigga no talking and no discussion
A whole bunch of led toes going up in your cousin
Your auntie, your uncle, your brother you thought it wasn't
424 miles to SoCal
And if you didn't know I bet you you know now
Niggas talking to me but staring at my gal
I don't pay attention I just watch 'em get aroused
Cause I am me and that's really who she wanted
See we ain't friends you didn't keep it one hundred
Guns start shootin', you hundred miles and runnin'
Strange Music bitch we keep carrying guns and shit
324 miles to SoCal
And if you didn't know I bet you you know now
Bet you didn't know I be shootin' like Kobe Bryant
Hit a nigga from long range soon as I sign in
Cause I am me and I'm running this game
Runnin' this game until I'm done in this game
Anyone of you niggas want it I make you flame
Heat a nigga and then eat a nigga souffl√©
224 miles to SoCal
And if you didn't know, I bet you you know now
Sick enough to just run up and bust it in the crowd
Turn 'em into dinner and whoever goes down
Cause I am me and I'mma just keep eating
A nigga with a mask on and I ain't trick or treatin'
Run up in your Halloween party cut 'em and leak 'em
Police never found 'em and its our little secret
124 miles to SoCal
And if you didn't know, I bet you you know now
Wanna see me fall off I'm all off the pow
I got choppas nigga call off your pals
Cause I am me and I'mma never stop shootin'
Tried hella times but I'm tired of recruitin'
Rollin' with my niggas I grew up, threw up with
Cause all you other motherfuckers can suck dick
Just under 24 miles to SoCal
And if you didn't know, I bet you you know now
Representin' the Snake and the Bat, nigga WOW
What you gonna do about it but throw in the towel
Cause I am me and I'mma just keep winnin'
Just like I was doing in the beginnin' straight gettin' it
Shit I ain't a nigga that sit still I'm shittin' still
Splittin' pills itchin' get me a Benadryl now
24 seconds to go to SoCal
And if you didn't know I bet you you know now
Led toes there his head goes nigga blouw
No need for an ambulance this is not a nosebleed
Cause I am me and I'm probably out of town by now
Or in your bedroom closet right now
Wait until you fast asleep and lying down
Who told you serial killing ain't dying down
524 miles back to the town
And if you didn't know I bet you you know now
Niggas talking to much but who clutch, none of 'em
No matter what you think I outlast everyone of 'em
Cause I am me and that's the path I chose
I'm dank nigga you can smell me as I grow
Put you in the Swisher and inhale I'm in hell
But I don't know how I got there I need intel

[Outro: Lauren Brinson]
Well, since you going to smoking in my office, maybe you could lend me a lighter?!
