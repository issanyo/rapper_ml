[Hook: C-Bo]
It's 187 on a motherfucking hook
Niggas out of bounds shoulda shook
We bangin' by the book
Got shot in the back trying to get away
And to a B.G. it ain't nothing but gunplay
It's 187 on a motherfucking hook
Niggas out of bounds shoulda shook
We bangin' by the book
Got shot in the back trying to get away
And to a B.G. it ain't nothing but gunplay

[Verse 1: C-Bo]
Buck these niggas, I'm a killer screamin' Regime
Deep NAVI's with heat like the A-Team
And when my K scream, it's causin' nothin' but murder
Bucking these niggas making 'em hate me
Yeah, nigga, we don't give a fuck, nigga we thug lords
Connected with Tech N9ne and touched for the thug war
Who got love for these niggas with no love at all?
Give a fuck, guns clutched, only left a ball
I know you heard of me ... wanna murder me
'Cause I'm the nigga that cooked the birds that flee
In the kitchen, palms itchin'
Had the whole gang unwrappin' chickens, nigga
And we was headed for the jack, strapped with a fat gat
All my niggas down to rat-tat-tat-tat
West Coast bad boys we was yellin'
Now it's West Coast Mafia, Regime, and thug zellin', nigga

And to a B.G. it ain't nothing but gunplay
It's 187 on a motherfucking hook
Niggas out of bounds shoulda shook
We bangin' by the book
Got shot in the back trying to get away
And to a B.G. it ain't nothing but gunplay

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Try to get me for my scratch, you can get your arm detached
If you try to rip me on a track, I put you in a Ziploc napsack
Believe it, I get Glocks at that price, I'm like
Martini and Rossi, Asti Spumante on ice
For niggas that kill 'em up on sight, kill a nigga night
Something with tinted widows dumpin' at your Pinto
Compliments of South Sacramento, you could ask Lil Zar or Big Zo
I'm a monster, I keep long gats like Charles Bronson
And I'm on some, put you in the trunk all fucked up and lonesome
It's gon' come, Armageddon, nigga, my arms are sweating
'Cause I been busting them model thangs
See, I'm good with the weapon, and plus...
I really don't like you, nigga, your whole crew can't bust
And I felt that shit way back when you was down with us
Clown wit' us, used to smoke a pound wit' us
Now I'm bound to cut you and your homies up
Nobody even heard your stuff
Said it's 187, 187
Me and C-Bo and Tech N9ne on yo' bumper bucking with a Mac-11

[Hook: C-Bo]

Niggas out of bounds shoulda shook
We bangin' by the book
Got shot in the back trying to get away
And to a B.G. it ain't nothing but gunplay

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Figure to catch this nigga, I'm ready to peel one
Instead of the shoulders, I gotta diss toward a nigga's grill some
Vigilante and villains and regime, niggas come with steel guns
Get ready to sleep 'cause you tripped when you fuck with a villain
Which one of y'all motherfuckers said, "Fuck Tech N9ne!"
Shady Pacino, turned C-ho when I clutched that N9ne!
Me and my nigga C-Bo, YukMezzo not only bust that rhyme!
We can do it illegal so the evil'll give a fuck next time!
Nigga, don't you ever spit my name
And thinking that shit's the same
Two thou we switched the game and spit the flame
"Allahu Akbar!" is what I say before I buck y'all
Motherfuck busters like Vell Bakardy-yeah nigga had enough y'all
Get ready to suffer, kneel down, nigga
Tech N9ne! Killer Klown, nigga
6 feet underground is where you're found, nigga
40 Water woulda never did a song wit'cha
If he knew the song was about me
Never make a million next time
(Say my name, say my name) like Destiny's Children, bitch!
