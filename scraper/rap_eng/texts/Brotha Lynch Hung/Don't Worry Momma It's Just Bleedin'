[C-Lim]
Can't believe this nigga got me out here on some Scott Peterson shit. Where the body at, G-Macc?
[G-Macc]
Hey, Lynch said it was dumped over here in the river on this side
[C-Lim]
That right there?
[G-Macc]
Yeah, that black bag. Get that shit, man
[C-Lim]
What, cuz? I ain`t getting that shit
That's some white people shit, it's dark
[G-Macc]
Go get that shit, cuz

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Nigga I'm the siccest in the west
Hit it in the chest
In a minute I rip a nigga like wet sex
Your sentimental I get the Ritalin shoot TECs
Cut a nigga in half just like a duplex
Then all I ask is “Who’s next?”
Take a nigga and give a nigga a suplex
Coathanga Strangla banging’ the deuce set
Choke and strangle her, name it in two blex
It’s the Season Of Da Siccness times three
Spitting the venomous IV full of white weed
And my nine get a tight squeeze
And I’mma die with my dick in a tight breezy
Believe me, I leave these - bodies they're probably gon' have my face on the TV
I’m like Jason in 3D, who in the game want to see me?
I’m at the motherfucking teepee
Plotting and planning it while I’m wiping off the three
Fifty-seven I'm makin' 'em go to heaven
One through seven I make 'em go see the reverend
In a casket, niggas get they ass ripped
Razor blades and dildos, nigga that’s it
Fuck around and get your hat split
I’m on some 'Tall Cangee got my back' shit
It’ll get venomous sending niggas at me
I keep a Russian AK in the back seat
I get the guns from the back seat
Brotha Lynch Hung he got the hacksaw ‘cause he loves to hack meat
Heat it, and eat it, and leave it
I'm even leaving 'em bleeding and feeding 'em
And I’mma keep it that deep
I stay hotter than the Sac' heat
One to the head then I smash like a track meet

[Hook - Brotha Lynch Hung and (Krizz Kaliko)]
Don’t get too comfortable
(Don’t get too comfortable, you might not stay, might be leaving)
Don’t worry momma it’s just bleeding
(Things will be fine if you just give it some time)
Just don’t get too comfortable
(Don’t get too comfortable, you might not stay, might be leaving)
Don’t worry momma it’s just bleeding
(Things will be fine if you just give it some time and let go)

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Now they got me on some supa’ dupa’ sick shit
So I’m a cut up and stab the beat
Like a slab of meat with slick shit
Now-now-now I’m with the sickness
And now I’m bludgeoning niggas because it is so ridic'lous
Juggernaut not random with the rambling
I’m super cede six seven kill her with the sampling
And chew them like beef tips ‘cause Kevin is a cannibal
Add me into the A team and I’m Hannibal
Mechanical robot, i will go hard and damage you with it
Roll with killers and I got a few with it
I got a musket and a pint of Muscatel
When they find you they be like, "What’s the smell?"
Take him took his top off, cause-it cause-it popped off
And we off’d him and cost him he soft I'm a boss and I (hey)
Took the coat hanger from Lynch
And I become the strangler if you flinch, leave her bleed quick

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Gimme the chop and I be hoppin' ready to die let’s go
Ready to pop and I see dropping every in my retinal
Send me the doctor who got the medical file death row
For the nurses who purposely hurt mamma with Trileptal
We told you motherfuckers that she was allergic
He heard her, slurred now pancreatitis emerges
Now I got you running from curses and hearses
Cut you like a surgeon ‘cause you deserve it
Two reverends is pitiful thinkin' they can get with Mr. Formidable
I pity your mental hospital, the hospitable
I’m not finished your thoughts are squashed dinner
For harps your off limits and lost with chopped genitals
I’m coming to get you with thunder though
Seeing you suffer's gonna be wonderful
Sick inside of me give you lobotomies time to undergo
Fucking with the Nina...

[Hook]
Don’t get too comfortable
Don’t get too comfortable, you might not stay, might be leaving
Don’t worry momma it’s just bleeding
Things will be fine if you just give it some time
Just don’t get too comfortable
Don’t get too comfortable, you might not stay, might be leaving
Don’t worry momma it’s just bleeding
Things will be fine if you just give it some time and let go
