[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
The coat- the coathanga
The throat- the throat strangla
Bangin' the GD Online like 3G
I'm coming in 3D with these bullets and no bullshit
In the back of the van I carry full clips
Don't believe me watch YouTube, I pull shit
I cause enough blood that you could fill pools with
You motherfuckers know the name, I'm insane
And I'm still loc'd to the brain and ain't nothin' to fool with
The Coathanga Strangla
Bangin' 'em up, maintaning the cut, put your brain in a cup
Brotha Lynch Hung and I see hangin' 'em up
Wearin' them out like clothes so niggas don't know it's me Spydie
Niggas'll suck that meat shit just to be by me
Shit'll get fucked up in the anal, just blame your breezy
I see spitters on a daily basis
Put 'em into muddy places
Bloody meat is what he tasted
I like to fry 'em and then I cum in they faces
And that's just one of the cases

[Hook]
With the chainsaw leave your brains raw, somebody just got cut
So when I'm coming in your window with a machete and a pistol
Best believe it's just to get me a nut
With the chainsaw leave your brains raw, somebody just got cut
So when I'm coming in your window with a machete and a pistol
Best believe it's just to get me a nut

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
To rappers I'm like John Wayne Gacy
Like ICP with the clown face, I be killin' 'em up, then I eat bacon
He's Jason Voorhees with a whore on her knees
Suckin' me, about to get the head cut off 'cause I see faces
Spittin' on niggas, I'm disrespectful, I'm a necrophiliac
Niggas'll get petro
Gas niggas everyday, ask niggas EBK
As if a nigga would, as if a nigga could
I wish a nigga would test me
Guess who's my brand new recipe
Open your chest like open sesame
Open your chest with these bullets
I pull it and it kills niggas
Puttin' holes in your Tommy Hilfiger, let the wheels get ya
Feed 'em the pills with the Bloody Mary's hot sauce
Soon as it pops off then it clocks off
All the cops saw is red on the walls
Blood on your draws, heat in you all
Beatin' the dog shit outta bitches

[Hook]
With the chainsaw leave your brains raw, somebody just got cut
So when I'm coming in your window with a machete and a pistol
Best believe it's just to get me a nut
With the chainsaw leave your brains raw, somebody just got cut
So when I'm coming in your window with a machete and a pistol
Best believe it's just to get me a nut
