[Verse 1]
I just cut another body up
And I had to get it out
So, i cook it up and I ate it up
And then I shit it out
Black bag full of bones
I'm gonna glad when ?I get ten thousand?
Put that bag in the back of the couch
And jump inside of the shower for an hour
?then hop in and ride back to the south?
See, I figured my niggas love me
But im gonna get them to hide me out
Shit, I'm gonna live inside that house
Then when the shit clear up
I clear out
Jump in the ?river?
I'm the king of Sacramento
Numbers don't lie, Please put that in yo mental
Jeans up, hoes down
And I got blood all over my clothes now
Twenty-Four people saw me
Twenty-Four more get chopped to raw meat
Awh, wow
Cops about to come with that forensics
Meta-examiners can't figure me out
They think I just been sick
(Grr) Swallowin' prozak you know that
Leaving niggas ?stuffed like????
Leavin' niggas dead with toe-tags
They call 'em the FBI, But that mean "First Body Identified"

[Hook x3]
(FBI) Choppin them bodies up
(FBI) F..B..
(FBI) Choppin they mommy up, F...B..

[Verse 2]
You wanna keep your head on your shoulders?
