[Brotha Lynch Hung]
I hate when niggas get on the phone when they're around me
It ain't business shit, if it was business shit I could see what you're sayin'
These niggas get on the phone man, make me feel a little funny
Ya know what I mean? You know what I mean Roberto?
You handle business when you get on the phone, nigga

[Verse]
I hate when niggas get on the phone when they around me
I really get paranoid, get the 50 pound piece
Pepper box in my socks, use it for ground beef
I know they plottin' so I don't go to town meetings
They wanna hit me like Barry Bonds
They wanna get me in the backseat and send me to my mom's
They wanna pick me up
They want the ambulance to get me up
They think I don't know
I didn't sign up for this
Black Market got me in this twist and did a flip-flop back flip
But this is Crip-Hop, that's it (cuzz)
Just wipe your dick off, that's it
Yeah, just get your bitch off, that's it
Just 'cause your shit's soft, that's it
I like to get off gat spit
I like to spit raw rap shit
I might get shit all backwards
Takin' it out on the wrong niggas and yeah that hurts
So I have to let the gat squirt then disappear
I'm satisfied and that works

[Outro]
Just before we get into the last song
Shouts out to Strange Music for puttin' me on
Ya know what I mean? This weather out here is crazy, it's crazy
