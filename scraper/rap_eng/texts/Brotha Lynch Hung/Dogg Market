[Snoop]
I'm in a murderous-mental mindstate
Monopolizin’ on 'em, enterprise with homicide
Rock this dope and cut them corners worldwide
Visualize two young killas on the rise
Ain't that a bitch? Snoop Dogg and Brotha Lynch

[Lynch]
And we remain bombed out (what), no doubt
Eat niggas up with sauerkraut (what up), haul 'em out
'Bout to open my own business, Siccmade Meats
Where you gonna get your product from, nigga?
Sacramento streets (WHY), gotta be
‘Cause these niggas be trippin’
I'm dippin' in and out the city with the Frank Nitti (With with what?)
With no pity, dingy, dirty, grimey and gritty, get me

[Snoop]
I had a bundle of bitches before I had a bundle a dollars
A fist full a problems while I'm poppin’ my collar (ay, ay, ay)
Sockin’ bustas, frontin’ hustlers with they work on the streets
From the streets, to the suites (To the what?)
To the slugs, to the heats (Bang)
Please believe, let me holler at you, nephew
What you do and what I do, I'll make you wan' act a fool

[Lynch]
Alright, wait, wait, wait, hold up
About 8 million lies up in the city
Smashin’ with the 50 slug, no love
Leave ya layin’ down lookin’ at the stars above (‘Cause what?)
‘Cause everything fade to black, like a scene change
Ain't it strange?
Illegal procedure, you out the game
Let ya nuts hang in the rain (rain)
On them roaches like Raid spray, laid 'em up with the hay
They, found the body three months later as I hit him with the potato
Ate up his midsection, recollection, murder on my mind (Ay, what)
Got me chin-checkin, and they said (He ain’t real)
Heard it all the time
That's what these muthafuckas think about me, they ain't made it
Mad ‘cause niggas be tryna sprout trees
And smoke weed every day, best believe, every day
Ay you, you niggas tryna stop progress, move out my way
Bet you never see me in black clothes
Creepin’ out the backyard hard-boiled with lead toes

[Snoop]
I got so much to do with so little time
My folks smoke dope that'll blow ya mind
I bust a bitch about a quarter to nine
So by 10:15, I got my dick on her spine
Relax, recline, roll somethin’, nigga
Hit this shit, blaze it up, now raise it up
The grip and the bitch, yeah, stays with us
Now, a lot of y'all niggas be talkin’ 'bout y'all livin’ it up
And give it up
But let me take it back to the essence and shit
Meditate and drop a message and shit
You crumb-snatchin’, no rappin’ peasants
The big dog want it all, I came back to snatch all y'all presents
Dippin’, slippin’, slidin’ away
From the Sac-town to the L-B, we do this shit like every day
Do you feel me? I'm the untouchable
Fuckin with the reputable, unquestionable, remarkable
Fabulous and all that shit
You know, I'm the original, biatch, the original, biatch
