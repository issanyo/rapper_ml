[Verse 1: C Mob]
Soaking up the moonlight after midnight
You can feel the paranormal activity level is high
Dancing in pale moonlight by myself
'Cause I'm tryin to spend time with the devil inside
You need help, think I'm crazy now?
You don't really wanna know how I truly felt
You don't wanna try put your hand up against mine
You will not like the cards that you'll be dealt
For some strange reason an untamed heathen
Is what I am, leavin' anyone’s brain bleedin'
You thinkin I'm possessed by this one same legion
Because I got the fury of an unchained demon
Rabid and grabbin', mentally I’m in a dark place
Like Camp Crystal Lake in the cabin
Vampire bitches sucking on my neck
When they're rubbin on my dick like the lamp of Aladdin
Damp in the sadden your date you're in harm's way
With the armblades I'mma fight like Baraka
Got the woman with the face of an angel, the body of a God
They say I bite like Akasha
In the night I'm a monster
And any enemy I come across in life I'mma conquer
Murderin everybody, leavin em in the river
Delivering death when I take a butcher’s knife to your roster
Don't piss, no more questioning, I sink my teeth in your neck
Bring death to your next of kin
Skin the flesh of the specimens
If I have to I'll summon the rest of the Nephilim
Make you bleed through your veins
On my teeth and my fangs
Why? 'Cause I'm pleased by your pain
Many years I've been deep in this game
No need to explain my reason is strange

[Hook: Charlie Ray x2]
For some strange reason
I get really into when I see you bitches bleeding
Where do I begin? I don't pretend this is the season
If you knew what is good for you then you would run
How I provide this homicide, it's stupid fun

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Sometimes I feel like I'm a ghost
Maybe it's the Henessy I drink that made me sit up in the corner when I boast
I be off the alcohol so much and throwing up when no one's looking man I feeling like I'mma fucking overdose
No one knows what I be going through
After all the sickness I be showing you
Maybe I'mma have to take it to another level
Maybe they can feel a nigga when I'm dead
With the bullet in my head, bloody red
Have a meeting with the devil
People tell me I'mma a rebel nigga because I'm a nacko
Sleeping in the alley but my flow is undeniable
I went to walk up in the school of rock and got to poppin
With the Glock and try to dip but, shit, my whip was unreliable
Im comin to peep a murder when a nigga flee the scene
I shoot you in the leg and letchu  know it ain't a dream
They can talk about me all they want
The one on one is what I want
I catch you niggas sleepin light yo dome up with the beam
Everything ain't what it seems, maybe it's a dream
Somebody pitch me off a beer to give you niggas what you want
I'm lyin in the pit, a hell already isn't is
And I can promise they can feel the pain when I come back and haunt
I'm gonna send you to the deep dark where you will be punished
Where every action has a motherfucking repercussion
Laugh about that shit and take a dolly if you want it
He gon bring up every time you went out with the homies buzzin
Fuck a bitch and keep it sick, people tell me that brain ain't
Normal and you can't reform a nigga that just can't change
I try to get new friends but everybody feel the mane strange
They trippin off of ends,  I'm overdosin off of rap game
I be feeling death, lurk around the corner looking at me
When I'm going through my everyday routine
Maybe it's my time, shit
If I gotta go than I'mma go out lookin motherfuckin clean
For some strange reason

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Fuck! Damn!
I've been going through some bullshit
Got a full clip, ready to pull quick and you will get exterminated
I'm the nigga that'll put you in the back of the trunk
They call me Michelangelo with the .12 gauge pump
I'm sick in the head and I'm always drunk
Ready to hit em up, get em up, put em up and sit em up
Givin' 'im an enema, send 'im a venom and then
Rip his tendon like a 350 engine [?]
His week is over, I'mma get back to the basics, leak his ovaries
He'll never get over me, nigga I'm a monster
Run up in the back of your house packin' an ouch
Leavin' blood all over your couch, I'm in and out
Drive through extra bacon and sauerkraut
End it by the hour, I'm bout to be out the shower
I need to cock back, put that milli up in your mouth
Suicide watch, you will die quick, do or die - you a fry
You are not shit, threw a nine clip in an AK extra
I don't wanna get bloody so I'm far when I wet ya
I'm a pitbull nigga
Nigga, you better duck when the shit pull nigga
It's cool nigga
Diss all you want
Is this all you want?
Shitzu nigga
Spit school scripture, Brain is sicker like Jack The Ripper
I'm back to business and
I'm ripping niggas in half and acting vicious
Crippin' with a blue rag and that's your nigga

[Interlude]
Hey, hey, hey!
That's that nigga, hey!
Hey, that's that nigga, yeah, yeah!
Roll down nigga, let's get this nigga, fuck that!
(pop, pop)

[Hook]
