[Chorus]
She thinks I'm a psycho, might go, mug a motherfucker so
Other motherfuckers know, cut your motherfucking throat
What you motherfuckers know? Tell me what you bitches know
Stitches though keep looking like a vicious dog

[Verse 1]
Throw the colt 45 yeah I gotta hide it
Yeah this cocaine spit fucking up my sinuses
I admit my brain runs on empty, tempt me
Known for leaving Tommy Guns empty, simply
Rhyming is nothing to me it's easy as breathin', believe me
I can spit it quicker than [?] what's the reason?
The season is sick and uh we don't need no weakness
Double homicide, suicide straight street shit
Kurt Cobain, no thang, put two in your brain
[?] Insane in the membrane, make Top Ramen out of his brain
Lost the tacos out of his meat, the blocks hostile
Pay a fee, then I took her on a trip with me

[Chorus]
She tells me I'm a psycho, might go, mug a motherfucker so
Other motherfuckers know, cut your motherfucking throat
What you motherfuckers know? Tell me what you bitches know
Stitches though, keep looking like a vicious dog
She tells me I'm a psycho, might go, mug a motherfucker so
Other motherfuckers know, cut your motherfucking throat
What you motherfuckers know? Tell me what you bitches know
Stitches though, keep looking like a vicious dog

[Verse 2]
Look, maybe I'm a sicko, split yo brains with the meat cleaver
I'm lactose that's why you see the blood in my semen
Slut, cook her deep dish, put the oven on 350
I'm loving the heat, if he comes up in the street
Since slice summer the heat like a Lanzhou morning
Two slugs in the brain, and I see you in the morning
I'ma eat you in the morning, breakfast when you
Naked, slip seconds, til' I get my severance
Seasoning for no reason being
Hungry eating human beings you could seen 'em
Yeah just like cow meat, now eat
Even in real life ground meat
Even you ville mic sound 'nique
I'm a chef ain't nuttin' left, you can get the cheap cheese
First, hook it up
Put the song on repeat, 'cause I'm keep eating people
Listen to me

[Chorus]
She tells me I'm a psycho, might go, mug a motherfucker so
Other motherfuckers know, cut your motherfucking throat
What you motherfuckers know? Tell me what you bitches know
Stitches though, keep looking like a vicious dog
She tells me I'm a psycho, might go, mug a motherfucker so
Other motherfuckers know, cut your motherfucking throat
What you motherfuckers know? Tell me what you bitches know
Stitches though, keep looking like a vicious dog

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm Johnny Rotten, pockets full of sex mischief
Count the money crystal, yeah I'm prolly schizo
Don't nobody know, 'cause I didn't have [?]
If I gotta eat 'llergic, better not get this close
Rip your ladies, and squirt your babies out the ground
And I did it just because they was around
In my cranium, something insane in them
Lyrical titanium, bloody up ya lounge
I'm a scoundrel you can looking all down low
Yeah they crooked all down [?]
Somebody gon' do restitching
I'll do the restitching after all the meat's missing
It's in my meat kitchen, you in the heat seat
And if you in the heat seat, you might get you feet missing
Mr. Molly and he's listing he's just a cheap [?]
24 license now he's missing, please listen
Hello? what you mean your ass out here?

[Chorus]
She tells me I'm a psycho, might go, mug a motherfucker so
Other motherfuckers know, cut your motherfucking throat
What you motherfuckers know? Tell me what you bitches know
Stitches though, keep looking like a vicious dog
She tells me I'm a psycho, might go, mug a motherfucker so
Other motherfuckers know, cut your motherfucking throat
What you motherfuckers know? Tell me what you bitches know
Stitches though, keep looking like a vicious dog
