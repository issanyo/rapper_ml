They disappeared, no COD
Don't trust nobody, this shit is weird
This shit is real, I have to own it
At any moment, they could be on me
They have to die, at least in my eyes
I'm so surprised, I open my eyes
I seen it all, they think I ball
I'll never fall, not as far as y'all

[Verse 1]
Them bodies gon' disappear
I'mma rip 'em in half, gettin' the last word in
I'mma sit in the back of the car at her job
When she get in the car, I'mma attack her jaw
I'mma cut up the face and put on her face and
Walk out the house with a machete like Jason
Kill her whole family, botox facelift
Nobody, no case, no body, no face
Barbecue, cocaine, I'mma rape your taste
I mean, I'mma rape your mouth, bitch! I'mma take guts out
And I'mma put 'em in the oven, yeah, I'mma eat that, love it
And won't you close your legs? I'mma hold up the plate like, "Bitch, you late"

[Verse 2]
We in your neighborhood like speed bumps, nigga
And I got that bloody face, sippin' on that Seagrams, nigga
And you want that season, nigga, where is that season, nigga?
I'm a misfit and I spit shit like I just got the fever, nigga
And I stay lit like Michael Irvin at receiver, nigga
Plus, I smoke like a chimney, enemies get ate
Fuck all the hate you were sending me, we straight
Even if these niggas steadily leaving, nigga
These niggas just teething, nigga
They don't wanna get in the ring with Ali
I might be leavin' 'em bleedin', no I.D
Body chopped up, I'm leavin' in my keys
Nigga, I hack up yo' bitch, what's up?
