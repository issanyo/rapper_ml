[Intro: The Devil]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha yeah
Ya'll interested to know
Check that shit, Lynch
It's the devil

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Yeah, the cap busting never stops
I got my clips and my Glocks
A bunch of motherfuckers give me props
Funny style fools, though
That's why I never Lynch Hung with the crews, loc
Never caught slipping, I knew I had to have mine (yeah)
So, I hooked up with my folks who hooked a nigga with a nine
Now I got my own back fade
And once ya start shooting at fools, you better have your own grave made
Fool named Blackie spitting at everybody 'bout
How he was hard and was knocking niggas out
I see some envious of the Lynch Hung
Every time I talk to 'em, fools say he just bought another gun
And I can feel 'em from a mile away
Fronting like he all that shit but like my nigga say
Depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
So, hey, I got my own back fade, nigga

[Chorus: The Devil & Brotha Lynch Hung]
Yeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
Yeah, I got my own back fade
Yeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
Yeah, I got my own back fade
Yeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
Yeah, I got my own back fade
Yeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
Yeah, I got my own back fade

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Nigga, I thought you knew you couldn't fade this
All them props you got ain't but fake shit
Trying to run up on a Uzi with a nine clip
And find your brain cooking in a barbecue pit (yeah)
'Cause I don't play that shit, loc, and I ain't soft
Bout your rumors Gimmy got his mouth shot off
Then, his head cut off just for fucking up
With a nigga that got a room full of baby gut
When I was peeping it I was tripping off of what I seen
Dumb nigga, you fronting on the wrong team
I could've had you with a click getting hella props
Now you running around like a monkey with his head cut off
Fucking with me
No, checking my nine pops
Leaving a nigga with a mouth full of gun shots
By a lunatic nigga sporting some old clothes
I'm like some paid to filling bodies full of bullet holes
And I can feel 'em from a mile away
Fronting like they all that shit but like my nigga say
Depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
So, hey, I got my own back fade, nigga

[Chorus: The Devil & Brotha Lynch Hung]
Yeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
Yeah, I got my own back fade
Yeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
Hey, I got my own back fade
Yeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
You know, I got my own back fade
Yeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
Hey, I got my own back fade

[The Devil]
Yeah you know what I'm saying
I'm the so-called Devil that Brotha Lynch was talking about, you know
And can't nobody fade this
This nigga packs his own people, you know what I'm saying
But with this cannibalistic fury, you know what I'm saying
So, um, Lynch help me with this shit, kick that old shit

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Most of my niggas come and go like a fool's life
A couple of 40's and a joint laid up nothing not
That's why I'm kicking with the hardest motherfucker living
My nigga nine eating humans like Thanksgiving
And it be eating em by the fours, at least
Marinating niggas skin like a thick slab of roast beef
Then, I'm cooking 'em while I'm fiending for fee
Drinking a 40, eat some human meat and sit and watch my teeth bleed
Ain't a motherfucker out trying to feel me
About a million motherfuckers wanna kill me
That's why nina got 16 partners
Smoking a nigga for my human meat pot luck
Click, pop, buckshots through a nigga's chest
Nigga ribs in my mouth, now who's next
I got the menu of a motherfucking cannibal
As I continue, I'm a human eating niggaro
Eating niggas with my nine, so, hey
You fronting like your all that shit but like my niggas say
Depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
So, hey, I got my own back fade, nigga

[Chorus: The Devil & Brotha Lynch Hung]
Yeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
Yeah, I got my own back fade
Yeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
Yeah, I got my own back fade
Yeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
Yeah, I got my own back fade
Yeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
Yeah, I got my own back fade

[Verse 4: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Coming straight from the grave with the rip gut
Cannibal Atheist, couldn't give a motherfuck
Heard a lot of motherfuckers wanna stop this
I keep em paralyzed, young, monotonous
Though I pop shit something like a blood vessel
Drink blood like a vamp, then, become amped
That means I take all the pussy and you get the fist
Grab a leg like a wishbone and make a wish
Pop, yeah there it goes first love lead
To a bed full of pussy bleeding bloodshed
Now I'm psyched 'cause I know a nigga wants some
He better pack a gun or know how to run
And I ain't met too many niggas that could eat meat
Like a nigga with a mouth full of crooked teeth
And I'm a motherfucker that thrive on homosapien beef
Them niggas don't know I'm seriously crazy
And I can feel 'em from a mile away
Fronting like they all that shit but like my nigga say
Depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back
So, hey, I got my own back fade, nigga
