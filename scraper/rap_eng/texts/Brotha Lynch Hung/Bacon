[Verse 1: Godemis]
Yeah, huh
I ain't looking for a cosign, most say we okay
Killer and I'm in no time, and get away so O.J
No heroes, I slayed 'em
They counting sheep in that dirt nap
And they were unaware that I slayed 'em
'Til I sprayed 'em with my worst raps
My first raps went spam Sammy with a grab bag of that been dope
Didn't realize back then when I was getting it in with my kinfolk
Revving up to go head to gut but no bread to cut
Gotta collect a check
Can't complain in this dirty game but ain't entertaining no disrespect
Humble enough for what the fuck's up
We R to the A to the W, uncut
You really think you're fucking with us numb nuts
Never pull a trigger hit a nigga with gun butts
Nonviolent, I'm nonviolent
My Holy Bible got bombs by it
Penciling, I get it in my friends and then I exit out of my PalmPilot
Swear to God, I'm hella odd, I got it
Smoking in the Shire like a hobbit
Kamikaze plane became a rocket
Life's a bitch I named Lorena Bobbitt
Rules are made to be broken
Nonetheless, I never see none breaking
King slid do everything big
This king pig and nigga we go bacon

[Hook: Murs]
Now this little piggy went to market
And this little piggy stayed home
But these three pigs right here had a bright idea
So they picked up the microphone
And the other little pigs got mad 'cause them niggas got hot
And they spot got taken
We said 'First of all, we ain't concerned wit y'all'
So we burnt 'em all and went bacon

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Everybody wanna be all up in it
Wannabes wanna shiver when they in front of me
'Cause I put him in a bad situation
That average, I'm baking 'em up in a apron
And I got a lot of food on my plate, I can't call it
Drinking problem, see, I'm a rapaholic
I'mma get particular, vehicular homicide describes me
They say I got acid in my IV
I'm back, why me? Travis knows
I'mma get a little grimy, twist the weed
'Til my eyes like Chinese
It's the B-L-H and I never been sleep with a cellmate
Trust me, put it out in a cell grate
Back now, fans wanna tailgate
I'm connected, smell the essence aching
Inhale it, nigga, we go bacon

[Hook: Murs]
Now this little piggy went to market
And this little piggy stayed home
But these three pigs right here had a bright idea
So they picked up the microphone
And the other little pigs got mad 'cause them niggas got hot
And they spot got taken

So we burnt 'em all and went bacon

[Verse 3: Murs]
Now I'm the kid from Mid-City
I like fat asses and big titties
Got a bad bitch in her mid-fifties
Like to drop it low and pop a thizz with me
I'm a weird dude, I'm into weird shit
Got a long dick and my beard thick
That mean I rap good and I'm from the hood
I know them wack niggas don't wanna hear this
I'm fearless, like last night
Dropped in on a 30-foot half-pipe
Hit a 50-50 grind and it was even more exciting because I did it while riding on a flashlight
Better act right or get your shit sprayed
Don't bring that wack rappin' over this way
And it's still no swine for the sensei
So I don't go bacon, I go tempeh

[Interlude: Murs]
And that—and that's like veggie bacon, nigga
It's like, tempeh is veggie—I don't know
I don't eat pork, bro
But y'all get the fuckin' point, man
Me, Lynch, and Godi, uh, Strange Music
Yeah, fuck y'all
We don't go—we go bacon

[Hook: Murs]
