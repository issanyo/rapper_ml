[Intro]
Yeah
Fuck this shit
This shit ain't going right
I'm-a have to move like I used to move
This shit ain't cool
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about
Back home, you know?

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Spend money on drugs and drink, it's been funny out here
You looking for love? It ain't...it ain't sunny out here
Hit you in the tummy out here, that's how I live life
Never enjoying the cash flow but now my kids might
That's how I'm doing this, this shit ain't for you
Fuck the family shit, motherfucker, because you're in it for you, right?
I used to be in it to do right, but now I'm-a do it like I used to
Because night-by-night, day-by-day, I tried to juice dudes
And they got used to it, took a kindness for weakness
Before you met me, you niggas was heatless
With hella niggas to creep with, so you thought you was hard
You used to ride the bus, now you got you a car
Now, you flex-flossing, you know how it is when you're bigger than the next
You be the money-making nigga with a vest, always in a mess
Because it's the sign of the times, telling me "nigga, move on"
My desire for music is too strong, I'm Mr. Fucking Do-Wrong
If I got to drop you, type shit, and I deal with it as it comes to me
You nitwit, I rip shit, just as quick as I get shit
Slip shit all in the clips, this ain't no chunk-'em homie shit

[Hook]
On any given Friday
Why they wanna test me on any Friday
It's meat fry day
Got to have it my way
I got my own recipe because niggas wanna mess with me
Your chest will bleed now
[x2]

[Verse 2: Crookwood]
I'm like a white blood cell when I'm not up in the blood stream
Mean mug me, until I hit you with the red beam
Fake-ass niggas be bumping their gums
But we don't do that punk-ass shit where we're from
Because snitches and fake bitches get more than stitches
I got 16 switches for your motherfucking britches
I'm ghetto as fuck, I eat off of broken dishes
I'm not a genie but I can grant your ass three wishes
I flow through traffic like blood through veins
So, all that internet gang-bang shit mean a motherfucking thing
Trying to gain fame off the next nigga name
Rather write it on a bullet and put it in your brain
Now you know Phonk Beta gets all up in your pores
Stop fronting in your bricks while saying it's yours
Next time you see me, punk, you better bring your heater
Never really like your ass even back on Manzanita

[Hook]
