Alarm clock, I hate alarm clocks

Hey, babe, I gotta get up
Real shit ya'll

[1st Verse]
I only got enough money for some hamburger meat
But I still ain't tripping that's the shit I like to eat
But my son he like daddy this is all we got to eat
I'm like son I'm about to sign big time
I'm downloading beats and I'mma start writin' to em
And if the fans don't buy em I'mma kill them in they sleep
Bring the extra cheese
We gonna eat somehow like the Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese
Gettin' dirty meats, make me some fuckn' stacks of G's
With the AR, automatic Uzi machine
All you gotta do is wash it off and then put it in the freeze
And then we good for another couple of weeks
When you get older like me you'll be tuckin the heat
And if not you, you'll be stuck in the street
I wanna say ya mom love you, but that's up to she
But we gonna do what we gotta do and that's get the meat
Strange Music got my back fade hopefully
But if not, see there really ain't no hope for me
That means you going through the same situation
That means we gone keep going through the same shit you hatin'

[Hook]
Meat, we gotta find something to eat
Even if we gotta go do it on the street
Even if we gotta go shootin' with the heat
Even if we lie to dude we gone get the meat, (meat,meat)

[2nd Verse]
I only got enough money for top ramen noodles
My son lookin' at me like he don't wanna come to close
He saw me in the bathroom cryin' it was too late
I couldn't even keep a straight face, like 2 face
All the mother fuckas around me they was to fake
I ain't got an album out now they call me too late
Bar b q yesterday, where the fuck was I at?
A football game where's my mother-fuckin' hi at?
I remember lizz moore drive even after that
Starin at my strange chain, thinking I ain't goin' back
I got a new life, I'mma get a new wife
I'mma get a new 9, I think it was due time
No matter who's wrong or who right
Life's like shakin' 'em up n rollin' 2 dice
Thin slice, and my old school homey like where you been ice
Just marinatin, stomach aching shit ain't been right

[Hook]

[Background vocals]
Real shit ya'll.......real shit ya'll......meat
Hey, Kev wake up, fading off, meat [Fades Out:]
Yo Kev wake up

[3rd Verse]
Lil Kevin wake up its school time, get ya clothes on
Don't nobody love you like me
We in the O zone, twilight zone
All we got to eat today is bullshit
Time for you to pray, but I don't pray I carry full clips
You can't be like me cause I'mma fuck up
And if we both fuckn' up you gone be just like me
It's gone be a tight squeeze, we can get through this
You my 'lil nigga so nigga we gone do this
Shit, I can count it on one hand
Old as I am I can still count it on one hand
We both Kevin Mann
We both gotta stretch it out like a rubber band
I got another plan, I got a million of em
I'mma still come with em, I'm still run wit em
We gotta keep it goin, then I'm done with it
That's it, I'mma wipe my hands
I'm hella broke but I don't dance

[Hook]
[Outro:]
“Alright son, what time you get out of school?
What 2:30?
Alright you meet me down the street where we usually meet at
I’m, I’m gonna get some money
You just get your fucking ass into fucking class, man
Alright, I love you”
