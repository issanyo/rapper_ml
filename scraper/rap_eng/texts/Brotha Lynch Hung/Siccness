[Verse 1: Pit]
Please Mr. D.O.C
Tell me could ya get a P.I.T. remedy
Im poisoned
I got this aching in my tum tum
Everytime i hit the chronic blunt i'm thinking redrum
Doomsday and EBK is all that a killa see
I'm having visions of ripping out a niggers spleen
My patience short and I killed before
And them voices in my head keep teelin me to kill once more
Whats up DOC is there any hope?
I try to cope but im loco to a cut-throat
Addicted to weed, smokin and drinking like a pirate
Ain't no denying it
A nigga down to start a riot
Sic wit it, down for killin niggas, im down for killin bitches
Set rippin on the haters
Fuck i pop a witness, siccness using chronic for my coffee fuck robotussin
Death runs in my day, is my prescription
Im sick brotha stay away unless you kick it too
Cause not no more you got the common cause of it too
So i stay true 347 dedicated to doom
Antibiotics, pennicillin can't help this feeeling
And i can't help kicking it with sick niggas
Cause my mind is gone... and my blood is black
And wit da siccness trickling in my dome im not alone
Ekklyps, Lynch and a nigga PIT sic the in a glass of chronic with a hot bowl of monkey shit
So imma call you in the morning docter gonna have my cure
My mediction 187 cure da siccness

[Hook]
It's the siccness , the siccness
It's the siccness , the siccness
It's the siccness , the siccness

[Verse 2: Eklypss]

Hit dat shit and feel like superman in mental cliccs
I got that sicc in the brain psycho norman bates shit
But im still that wicked insane siccness
Nigga EKlypss
Load the clip and hit dat alley with the torch
Bust, be sure to get them bitches on the porch
If you miss ain't no time for reloadin no empty clips
Get your ass split, hit with a dose of this evil siccness
How could you love me the killer
With murder in my eyes everytime i see a bitch nigga
With the millimeter to your gut
9 ,10, 11, 12 niggas i done fucked up
Shit Doc, im steady swingin with this axe
And a fact ive done sharpened every tool in my shack
Attacks imma brainstormer body draining embalmer
Bitch harmer with that same sicc doom drama
My definition of a killer
6ft 240lb nigga
Eklypss, i got some evil shit thats creeping through my terror dome
I take an axe and hack up every motherfucker on
And goin murder with the quickness
Nigga this wiccedness, doom shit siccness
Not shit tell me what the fuck is wrong with the Ekklyps

Whisper : (you got a mutherfuccin fatal case of the siccness)

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Just touched down, 15 years
Knowing niggas rather put a spike in ya ears
Cut ya nuts of mix'em with ya grits
Cut ya dick off ya stitchem with ya bitch made nigga's die early
Hard niggas die quicker off the jail house liquor
Now you a sicker nigga. Quick creeping with yo black ice pick
Trust me it ain't a good sight when ya killin them
Mix'em up and i fix'em up in a crockpot full of gravy
Need more shit so i hit the block with my baby
80 rounds clips admit if it ain't that siccness then witness dead bodies and maserati's lookin like swiss chesse and tato chips
Whats wrong with a nigga DOC?
I can't stop fiendin for the chop chop
And i bet the nigga's on my lot dont like my plot
So i empty out these nigga's chest house the session,robotussin
Couldn't hurt but these chromosones done got me stressin
Smith and Wessun, murder session
Sick nigga's doomsday taught a nigga one lesson
Off the 4-0 ounce ,  and im siccer than siccer they told me

[Hook]
It's the siccness , the siccness
It's the siccness , the siccness
It's the siccness , the siccness
