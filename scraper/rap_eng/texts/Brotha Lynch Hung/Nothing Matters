[Intro: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Here we go again
Same old shit
It's kind of hard
Yeah, This how I'm feelin mane
My nigga Sevin mane
C.O.S
....
I feel you dog

[Hook]
My Broken Heart Can Not Lie
My Tears Reveal The Feeling Inside
Then Nothing Really Matters
My Broken Heart Can't Lie
You the pain in my empty eyes
Because Nothingï»¿ Really Matters

[Verse 1:?]

How they expect me to get it right for christ
When I got 3 homies thats fightin life
Sposed to give the young homies the right advice
But I'm knowin damn well they could die tonight
Shit I'm ridin like it's 1980-somethin
The way I get it in you swear that they paid me somethin
But I love 'em n that's all that matters
N Ya'll all I got so that's ya'll advantage
'Cuz the only thing they got to look forward to
Is me on t.v. gettin an award or two
Shit, this is what this cold world will do to you
Take the midst outa you for make them apart of you
Top of the mountain I'mma carry these niggas
N Live it all up, not tryina burry these niggas
Man I'm driven by these scars
Given 25 years of pain in only 16 bars
But its hard, chyeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2:?]

I'm lost in the shadows of night
So many reasons to fail
Conversations with the demons in hell
I hear em whisperin
Through the bottle I am sippin
Tears drippin
On the clippin
Put hollows in his business
How can I walk away
Blood on my hands will never wash away
My life is just 1 big eternally awfull day
Soul of a Solider gets colder & colder
In my sleep I relive my death over & over
It's lethal, and yet so peaceful
In the grave that I dig
Failed fatherhood so ain't no saving my kid
Yeah independently of some tragic waste
Talents counter act the balance of my shattered space
It's like sadness is attractive
And I'm thrown a kiss
Smiling for the sake of others
My happiness don't exist
I fall apart within my heart & soul
What ya'll call a heart, I call a hole

[Hook]

[Verse 3: COS]
I got it
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I see my life at a stand still
I stand alone in a field, both my hands filled
One with a pistol, the other with a bottle
Hoping God come get me, before a nigga see tomorrow
Cuz life's so hollow, filled with nothing but pain
The love will never out-weigh the hate
That's why I aim to spit the truth
But you know how a C do
Swear under oath to tell the truth & the whole truth
Every time he hit the booth
Nothin but facts fall
I need a bottle of yacc ya'll
Somebody bring it back ya'll
We lost somewhere
Like you need a little church n a cross somewhere
He been fightin off the demons, just smokin & drinkin
Up late hardly sleepin like, he scared of dreamin
Might be somethin that he see in the mirror, got him
Sinkin real deep into a zone just thinkin
Nothin matters here

[Hook]

[Verse 4-Brotha Lynch Hung]

Drinkin a lot more beer
Smokin a lot more cigarettes
Open a lot more niggas chest
Oh it hurts. Gotta be a hole in my heart
Every once in a while it squirts
Every once in a while I got to check to see if it works
Next to me, evil lurks
Trying to get that monkey off my back
Put in evil kneevle work
Take Chances, Tango with death dances
Angle the Tech blasted
Angel with death asthma
I had a best friend that couldn't even last
Cuz fame had to send a choke hold, fuckin bastard
Put the lock down on the local, then I passed it
I'm one psychotic can't remember my middle name or my last one
You can ask her it deteriorates faster & as the
World turn my heart burns to ashes as if
At my age I could last it
It's my page & it ain't
Paper or Plastic, &
That's it

[Hook]
