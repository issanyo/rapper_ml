[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
It's another murder after the fact
Twist a motherfucker's hat to the back
Sicker than rat poison
I BLLLAT them niggas, hit in the back back bllat bllat bllat
He gon' feel it, I'm 'bout to peel his banana real quick
Spit the siccness, get ya dick split, witness
Sick of this shit business
I'ma put him on a hit list
Teach him about the Season Of the Siccness
Six six six shit
Creep in ya house, put a gun in your mouth
And I'm under the house, HIDIN'
Bodies under the couch and I ain't coming out I'm goin out dying
Try them, undeniable, I don't know I just fry them though
I come, hard on the face, probably 'cause I don't like 'em
I'm a OG Viking, Cris Carter
I spit harder, I get farther
Put it in the butt, his daughter
Spit a nigga nut

[Hook]
'Cause I'm taking online orders
'Cause I'm taking online murder

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Put a body up in the trunk
Now you're stuck in a rut
Get it rough in the butt
While I'm puffing the blunt
Get it up in the gut, put them up in the cut
I'ma stick them and rip them
I'm dipping them in hot sauce
Legs and arms, a little bit of agent orange, a hot tata's
Hot totties, I rot bodies
Tune in they ass, talk naughty
Broom in they ass, I probably
Fuck them until they get blue in the ass
Got robbery, bloody bodies
Nigga nuts in your hot coffee
Motherfuckers better get off me
I will slit 'em in they neck ever so softly
Watch me
Anybody wanna come fuck with him, come face him
I'll be in Camp Crystal Lake like Jason waiting
Take them and rape, them then I cut 'em up
Bake them and ate them then I throw them up
Shit them out
You gon' forget about 'em, you gotta live without 'em
And I'm out

[Hook]
'Cause I'm taking online orders
'Cause I'm taking online murders

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Nigga ya gotta be willin' to give me ya soul
I don't be taking the minimal, gotta be whole
Look at the stranger, get with the strangler
Given a liver of pig and a stick in a bowl
I come in oven I'm puttin' 'em off
And a nigga be lovin' to eat a bitch up and I throw it up in the commode
BLEGH!
Nina be looking to get with another because of a nigga within him is cold
I cannot contain what is insane within this brain, nigga
Never was a mundane but I was in pain, fuck it, then came liquor
How did I become bane, put enough strain, now the lust rains
With a snuff frame killa
Rippin' mothafuckas up, I open 'em up, the puss came quicker
Hotel, motel
I don't give a fuck, I'm picking bitches up I make her lick it up
I'm busting gonorrhea nut until her throat swell
Better let go of my coat tail, I'm gonna propel into more hell
Taking online orders from my cerebellum, you can get it wholesale

[Hook]
'Cause I'm taking online orders
'Cause I'm taking online murders
