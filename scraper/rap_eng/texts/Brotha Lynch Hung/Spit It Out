[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung & COS] x2
If anything tastes funny, spit it out
Don't trust it, don't eat it!
Somebody's trying to poison me
Somebody's trying to get in my life
Motherfucker make them eat it (All blood, all over the wall)

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
If anything tastes funny spit it out
Writer's block in the studio
But I'mma get it out
I was taught to just do me though but won't follow directions
Cup of liquor at the intersection while I'm clenching on my weapon
Contemplating suicide thinking about little Kevin
Thinking about my girlfriend
Thinking about my situation
Thinking about will my world end tragically
So many people mad at me
I make them go away magically
But I just
Put it behind me until they find me
This is perfect timing
This is hurtful rhyming
This is put you in the bushes if you try to try me
This is what you wanted so I'm going out for the fried meat
And when I die please burn me up and smoke me
Sorry I can't believe the fucking lies that you told me
Cause loyalty is loyalty but you don't know about that
Right after this COS rap nigga I'm coming right back

[Verse 2: COS]
If anything tastes funny spit it out
Can you taste it?
Can you smell it in the air?
Smell like bodies in the basement
Come take a walk with me down a road so sacred
Dead man walking scars underneath the bracelet
No leaves on the trees dusty roads, no pavement
No sun
No shine
Just a lot of raining
One gun, one mind
Who am I to save it?
When I'd rather pop the clip and just blaze it
Bloody stage shit
Every room vacant in the house and I'm shaking
I'm colder than the glacier
Even when my heart baking
Everything aching can't repair myself
Every mirror in here broken like I can't stare at myself
I see clear through the smoke cause I got air in myself
But every time they give me rope they think I tear at myself
Like I'm the plane crashing into the building
Like I'm the death
Like I'm the train coming off of the tracks
Guess I'm a wreck

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
If anything tastes funny spit it out
Throw it up, sew it up, right out the 50 throw it up, right out the kidneys toe it up
Trying to get with me it's tough like trying to eat
Old meat
Left out
All night
Aw me
Oh my
Now I'm going through the pain and I'm to blame, they think the money and fame equals insane
It's a Strange game
Looking at my Strange chain
Thinking I'm about to change mane
I'mma let it stay the same
I'm online when I play the game
On time nah maybe not
On grind nigga I'm probably the hottest
I'm a problem, I got problems, I don't know how to solve em all of them, hitting me at the same time
That's why I seem like I'm hitting you with the same rhyme game time
Niggas ain't in my lane I'm
Hard to get along with sometimes
That's hard life
Compare it to the hard right
I put it on the black top
Cause it's going to be a hard fight
And it's going to be a long night
And it's nothing to bitch about (it's nothing to bitch about)
