[Verse 1]
Leaving Reese's pieces
My thesis, bitch give me something to eat with
A brand new recipe anatomy deep dish
Chop! Cut! Chop! Cut! Anatomy deep dish

I'm so tired of this shit, my life's like
My life's like nigga I'm twisted, the nice guy
Always getting stiffed it and if this shit don't change
I'm a get those brains and I'm a get those brains and briskets
And mix it, sick shit started the sickness
Now bitches and niggas think I'm soft like biscuits
But it gets hard like bitches nipples
My shit goes hard won't fit in the toilet, won't flush
Niggas think they fucking with Lynch, nigga don't,  hush
Got a nigga's guts looking like one's crushing it
If your house was a bitch nigga I'd run it up in your stuff
Niggas think I'm nuts cause I kill and bust nuts
I'll be off the X not even knowing what's what
Rivals get cut up
I can't smoke so I'm murdering for fun
And that shit's fucked up

[Hook]
Look it's a dead body, over here
Blood all over the place like motor steel
Niggas ain't fucking with Lynch
You know the deal
I eat 'em when I am done with 'em, nigga
That's overkill
Yes sir, yes sir

[Verse 2]
Leaving resses pieces
My thesis, bitch give me something to eat with
A brand new recipe anatomy deep dish
Chk, chk, cha, anatomy deep dish

I might kill her for nothing while I'm nutting
After they dead I'm fucking, aight
Spit so nasty my teeth don't look right
Fucking dead bodies at night (fucking dead bodies at night)
I'm just sick in the head, getting the bread
MC's getting the blade instead of the lead
This time I'm keeping the brain instead of the head
This crime is hitting the news instead of the feds
Y'all niggas bust like fags, Adam and Ed
Have your whole family looking out of a red
Have the hoes panties drippin', I'm straight Crippin'
Light blue six four but with the paint still dripping
24 street block throw it up daily
Still having abortions nigga
I don't need babies
And I don't eat babies
I'm sicker than the rabies
Still hella mad cause I didn't sign with Shady
Records, but I'm strange now, snake and the bat
Nigga, sickest independent on the map, nigga brap nigga
Look at it like that nigga
Wanna see a dead body? This is where it's at nigga

[Hook]

[Therapist]
That's not what you told me
I read in the paper the other day that you were eating people
A taking their skin and cooking them
And then devouring them
Then devouring them...

[Verse 3]
Leaving Reese's Pieces
My thesis, give me something to eat with
A brand new recipe anatomy deep dish
Chk, chk, deep dish

I know this is different, different
A lot of people tell me I'm gifted, bitches!
Tired of gettin' cheated, fuck this shit
If shit gets worse, I'm a rent me a hearse
Leave a nigga's balls in his girlfriend's purse
Bad news is you'll never see where he lurks
It don't even hurt, waterfall dripping out the skirts
When it comes to rapping I am Captain Kirk
Higher that the spaceship
So I wrote the album
Niggas try to put me in the middle like Malcolm
YouTube Sicc teevee, you see the outcome
Lock 'em with a machete and I won't leave 'em without one

[Hook]

[Outro]
Damn! Even my therapist turning on me, man
What the fuck is going on in this motherfucker
God damn it!
Never tell anybody that you know where a dead body is
Or you gonna get checked first
All the time, it always happens
