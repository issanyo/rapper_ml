[Intro: Tanqueray Locc]
...Me in life
I knew they'd never treat me right
In time I'd learn to keep the knife
And then there's all those sleepless nights

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
I'm off the radar, 20/20, stressing I need money
Fulfilled my obligations, what the fuck else they want from me?
Faithful to the game like Kobe is to the Lakers
Even if I'm losing I'm cruising because I made it
I could drop a record in a second and still wreck shit
I don't need no help, I just go my own direction
Stay in my lane man, tired of people
Trying to give me all the game man, you're not equal
I'm a G when it comes to this rhymin', sharp as a diamond
I know, stop drinking, you care? Stop lying
I will die for this and if you listening
To this record I'm on home detention, I'm fucking pissed
Trust me, I know it's my fault, you ask how come
I used to think I had to drink, I can't live without one
Hope I don't feel like I have to murder a nigga
Witness it but never act like you heard of a nigga

[Hook: Tanqueray Locc]
It's always only me in life (it's always me)
I knew they'd never treat me right (treat me right)
In time I'd learn to keep the knife (keep the knife, keep the knife)
And then there's all those sleepless nights (sleepless nights)

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Think I smoked six packs of cigarettes back to back
Yeah, I've got a bad liver but I'll crack the yack
I've got the semi-automatic in the back of the 'lac
And if I finish this bottle I don't know how I'm gonna act
Up late, all night, like I'm smoking on crack
Yeah, I smile in they face and I give them some dap
Then I take them to the back and I show them the pit bulls
I'm hella schizo and I'm packing a pistol
I need my shit too, I need my check fast
I can eat them for breakfast then I just break fast
I never take last, always in first place
I'd rather get dirty if it's the worst case
It's almost my birthday, money is funny
And I'ma get dummy, run up in your house and shoot through the tummy
I need money and if I have to murder a nigga
Witness it but never act like you heard of a nigga

[Hook: Tanqueray Locc]
It's always only me in life (it's always me)
I knew they'd never treat me right (treat me right)
In time I'd learn to keep the knife (keep the knife, keep the knife)
And then there's all those sleepless nights (sleepless nights)
