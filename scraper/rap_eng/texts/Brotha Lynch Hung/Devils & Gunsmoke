(talking)
Yeah, straight from the muthaf**kin duece
It's the brotha lynch hung once again, ya know what I'm sayin
And all I see is muthaf**kin devils and gunsmoke, ya know
But I ain't gon' trip, I'm just gon kick some shit for y'all muthaf**kas
So peep this out

Niggas better always know
For y'all so-called devils and gunsmoke
Walkin through the duece
Ya got, better eat, no joke
Livin life like a muthaf**kin criminal
Watchin my back from gettin jacked by the 5-0
One-time peepin a nigga out
A couple a dank sacks in my dickies
Ol' english in my mouth
Ya know, and if it wasn't for my muthaf**kin skin tone
I wouldn't even trip, just strike my black ass home
Even if I had a chrome
I bust two caps and head home
Hopin to hit fools right in the dome
'cause all I see is devils and gunsmoke
Pussy and hoes, and hella blood when my nine blows
A young nigga on the rage, rampage
Twenty-four years of age with a 40 and a 12-gauge
And then a muthaf**ka change
Baby killin ass nigga and ain't a damn thang strange
A muthaf**ka sold juice, bulletproof
Known to eat a pussy and put a gun inside of it and shoot
A nigga wit' a mind so bad
Close my eyes, and all I see is little bloody babies in a glad bag
Nigga, manson ain't shit
I got niggas killin mamas and niggas on the devils dick

But now it all adds up the this, locc
Niggas hatin God and all I see is devils and gunsmoke

(talking)
Yeah, you know what my drunk ass father told me
He said 'look little nigga, you have to run your own muthaf**kin life'
And I was trippin, 'cause this muthaf**ka had a gun to my muthaf**kin head

It was about 12 o' clock, somethin don't smell right
I'm in the hall in the middle of the night
Somethin reekin like sweat, drippin off a burnt up pig
Muthaf**kas in the crib, crept through the hall like a thief
Fiends a fiends, and cocaine smoke nigga no-name
Folks run in the crib, you know the situations tore up
My homies sellin dope to my folks but you know what
I don't give a f**k no more 'cause i'ma blow up
Usin all the fury inside to make some more cuts
'cause all I see is what?
Black muthaf**kas walkin 'round tryna' found out what's what
Smoke up, but all I see is threats
Swear if I see anotha muthaf**ka I don't know
In my crib, i'ma shoot him in the neck
Pimp respect for a muthaf**kin vet
Causin anotha nigga death
Do a little time for a slut
Shoot before I get shot, playin fools like a half deck
'cause all I see is devils and gunsmoke
I say that 'cause I don't wanna claim and end up like x-raided
You know I gotta eat if I eat ya, see if I see ya
Shoot up, then I'm on my way
'cause my mama used to say, it ain't a hoax
Because niggas are hatin God and all I see is devils and gunsmoke
