[Chorus]
Left his blood on da rug—evidence
Could have been mine or his, so I’ve been stressed out ever since
Left him on the concrete wit' his head split
Found out where I live by this, by this, punk bitch
Knowin' it’s about to crack like an indo sack, I'm hella fucked up
So with the heat, I commence to peak out the window, waitin'
Ran off the indo, shakin’ niggas like Barry Sanders ‘cause they weak
They weak, hella weak, and I’m at my peak

[Verse 1]
When I'm buckin' at the enemy, it’s like ten of me
Choppin' down trees, twistin' up leaves, 'bout to make niggas bleed
Off the hook like a fish with his lip cut, get away, got away, rip gut
Hit 'em up with enough lead stuff to turn 'em into a magnet
Body in da dragnet, keep my Dickies saggin', blue flaggin'
Body draggin' down the street to the end of the creek
And it’s evil you seekin’
Creepin’ through the grass of the Gardens, dick hard
And I’ll be draggin' on a Garcia Vega with the green flavor neighbor-
Hood make or break a deuce-four, fuck a hoe
A lotta niggas don’t know but it’s lose a hoe, gain a hoe
So, bruise a hoe who's to know, really doe, follow me up
I’ll leave your body in the back of the '84 Cut, all chopped up
Look through my window at night, and you can get glass in your eye
After that your ass gon’ die, screamin', and that’s no lie
You'll be passin' me by, every night until I come out with the mini Mac
And attack like a pit bull off that dumb shit you pulled
I'm talkin 'bout…

[Chorus]
Left his blood on da rug—evidence
Could have been mine or his, so I’ve been stressed out ever since
Left him on the concrete wit' his head split
Found out where I live by this, by this, punk bitch
Knowin' it’s about to crack like an indo sack, I'm hella fucked up
So with the heat, I commence to peak out the window, waitin'
Ran off the indo, shakin’ niggas like Barry Sanders ‘cause they weak
I mean, they weak, hella weak

[Verse 2]
I know, gotta roll, like dough, blow the whole
Eastside into smithereens, leaving all the bloody streams
You niggas didn’t give a fuck about me
So I left you stranded on the Titanic, don’t panic
You just need some fuckin’ heat fuckin’ with me
Nigga, it’s like fuckin’ yo’ momma
Nigga, it’s right in front of your face, it’s drama
Making your space, taking your place
Nigga, you weak, weak as fuck
Muthafucka, duck, grab your cut
Trying to get away from me and my AP, let me know when you had enough
Cleaning up these streets, getting rid of these hoes and foes
You could see me in my blue clothes, sitting on Trues and Vogues
Waitin’, see me on the street and you ain’t got nothin’ to say to me?
Well, fuck you, two dicks and a four-fifth, smoke you like a bomb zip
Suck blood from my mom’s tit, that’s how sick
I got that gangsta disease—I be lovin’ to bring ‘em to they knees
Make me nut like semen—seemin’ like a demon
When I red beam ‘em, seen ‘em, with the AP eatin’ up human beings

[Chorus]
Left his blood on da rug—evidence
Could have been mine or his, so I’ve been stressed out ever since
Left him on the concrete wit' his head split
Found out where I live by this, by this, punk bitch
Knowin' it’s about to crack like an indo sack, I'm hella fucked up
So with the heat, I commence to peak out the window, waitin'
Ran off the indo, shakin’ niggas like Barry Sanders ‘cause they weak
Hella…hella weak

[Verse 3]
Them niggas that wanna empty out my chest plate
I hit ‘em with fury and make ‘em go sickly from the snake bite
A parasite, you ain’t tight
Try to fuck with a nigga to get right, end up in a pit bull fight
Trust me, my trusty heat is rusty
Waitin’ for the scene to get dusty, and all you see is just me
Standing like the last man standing, but I ain’t no Bruce Willis
Manic depressive and restless, I’m a hog about my juice—feel it?
When I plug you with the TEC, ghetto chef
Cuttin’ niggas up like David Koresh, welcome to your own death
When the funk was on, your nigga crept, like a spider
Denied her of a life, then nutted all up inside her
I kiss the bitches and made ‘em switches, get you for all your riches
In your backyard I’m diggin’ ditches
Tend to act hard, you get your lip split
My weapon got the chrome dipped like Scottie Pippen
I’m dippin’ from long range, hit ‘em up, what part of the game is it?

[Chorus]
Left his blood on da rug—evidence
Could have been mine or his, so I’ve been stressed out ever since
Left him on the concrete wit' his head split
Found out where I live by this, by this, punk bitch
Knowin' it’s about to crack like an indo sack, I'm hella fucked up
So with the heat, I commence to peak out the window, waitin'
Ran off the indo, shakin’ niggas like Barry Sanders ‘cause they weak
Hella weak, them bitches be weak, weak
