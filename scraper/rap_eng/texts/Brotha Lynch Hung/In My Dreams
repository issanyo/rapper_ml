[Intro]
Christopher?
Christopher, it's time to wake up

[Verse 1 Krizz Kaliko]
I keep having dreams
Of you and
Me eating ice cream together
I wake up and scream
Because your not
Lying next to me forever
("you're gone" choir)
Soon my thoughts are putting you away is OK
I know that your with him so I guess ill pull an OJ
There he is
But I be curious
Is he touching you the same way
That I used to attack exactly like it was game day
I usually got good intentions but
Im kind-of relighting your house up like its incense
Nobody can put in their two cents
She's clueless
But still can get it
Anybody can kill or live it
I need them pills or a medic
If you was me
Would you still have did it
No
We reconcile in the domisile
Be good for a while but I keep thinking
Life is sometimes darker than it seems
But luckily its only in my dreams
Mama sing

[Hook Barbara Word]
Only in my dreams
See the world ain't it seems to be
In my dreams
Only in my dreams
What ain't real to you is real to me
In my dreams
Only in my dreams
Only in my

[Verse 2 Brotha Lynch Hung]
I used to love her so much
More than I love these cigarets
More than I love these internet (girls)
But it still ain't even went in her yet
Still ain't even a minute yet
Deal my dinner like any sex
Might've been off her like 20 sacks
Paranoid nervous
Waiting in the bushes
Waiting for her to push them curtains
Take em, making me dirt quick
Perfect I'mma murk it
I'mma soak it
Leave it seeping
Leak it
I'mma be eating it up like Peking
These things bout to surface
Her husband don't like me
I think he's cursed us
First just I'mma stab him
And put him up in them hearses
Worsens
He just thinks my daughter is a splitting immage
Wait to spit her
And didn't finish
Ain't this rigorous
If this finish
Lick my lips right after I finish
I might just turn it on me and use it
I feel like I'm pretty useless
So I'm sipping on these two fifths
Scraping off my tooth's
See death is not a theme
So I'mma lean out the bushes
What am I thinking
Wait mama's saying

[Hook]

[Verse 3 Big Scoob]
This must be a dream
I'm seeing things I've never seen in my life
No more fiends
I'm with the team that got me scheming for flight
In this dream it's all wicked
Man the dark is the light
The black is the white
It's different they don't follow my plight
Gutter gems and Gutter hems
I don't toy with the light
I'm not grim so to them I don't belong in this life
Spit it different how I lived it
When I be rocking the mic
Know rap it's spitting
Just my vision how I journey through life
So suck it up and keep it pushing
I'mma stomp on your haters
Enjoy my days rock the stage
And keep my faith in the sake
Don't get complacent can't forsake
In this world of replacement
I can taste it time to take it
All my life has been wasted
Some hate it some love it
But I'm building a team
A rock star Gutter music
Watch my life on the screen
An epic thriller like Godzilla
I get stripped from your screams
Please don't wake me from this dream
Man I love when she sings
Mama sing

[Hook]
