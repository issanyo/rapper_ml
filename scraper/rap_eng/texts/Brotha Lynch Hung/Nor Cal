[Intro: Ren Da Heatmonsta]
Yeah, Premeditated muthafuckas
Where the fuck you from mane?
Rep that shit, I'm from northern Cali mane (West up)
West side, wherever you from rep that shit
Don't be afraid to rep that shit biatch

[Verse 1: Ren Da Heatmonsta]
I'm from northern Cali and we throwing up [?]
Blowing big bomb and we repping proudly
We say the word hellish, raining game I tell ya
No [?] got go smell ya
Where Pac learned the game, Mac Dre was Cali livin'
Short got everybody sayin' "Biatch!"
What we spitting, where they hustle hard [?], livin' life like rap stars
808 mob shit, make the trunk slap hard
Off that Bolo gas chamber, knockin' [?] 'til the Bay is poppin'
Now the whole industry jockin', but never show love
They took slang words from Earl-40 and never gave it up
We refused to lose as the homie Lynch Hung
They playa hatin' us tough like Yuk' and 'em
I got more than five on it, let's get down on it
They can hate on northern Cali, but I don't think that they want it

(hey Ren, what they talking 'bout?)

[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung & Ren Da Heatmonsta]
Northern Cali, Sacramento, Stockton
We don't care my nigga, we will pop you
Leave you dead my nigga with the Glock 10
Glock 20, Glock 40, it'll sock him
Northern Cali, Sacramento, Stockton
We don't care my nigga, we will pop you
Leave you dead my nigga with the Glock 10
Glock 20, Glock 40, it'll sock him

[Verse 2: Ren Da Heatmonsta]
Gas, brake, dip to the muthafucking side show
Knock you a bitch and make her your side ho
For what it's worth I've been laced since birth
Survival of the fittest, trying not to murked
Yeah, they gang bang out here and rep the turf
Just like anywhere else on this Earth
I started off on Thunderbird with a Kool Aid pack
And a few Philly blunts with a [?]
Now I'm rolling up top grade, don't give me no 'Bama
And let's get it started like MC Hammer
Northern Califurnia got that new wave grammar
You can be a [?] even if you [?]
Ahead of our times when it comes to these rhymes
Why you think I named my first album "Hard On The Grind"?
From parking lot pimpin' to hood back alleys
I'mma always represent northern muthafuckin' Cali

[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung & Ren Da Heatmonsta]
Northern Cali, Sacramento, Stockton
We don't care my nigga, we will pop you
Leave you dead my nigga with the Glock 10
Glock 20, Glock 40, it'll sock him
Northern Cali, Sacramento, Stockton
We don't care my nigga, we will pop you
Leave you dead my nigga with the Glock 10
Glock 20, Glock 40, it'll sock him

[Verse 3: Ren Da Heatmonsta]
From Sac to Stockton, Modesto rocking
San Jo', San Francisco, Oakland is clocking big bread
Vallejo picked birth, flipping big birds
The whole 831 keeps the doja, ya heard?
Watsonville, Salinas, Hollister, Gilroy
Knock a muthafucka down with the big noise toys
Oh boy, can't forget Turlock and Tracy
Antioch, even in Jackson [?]
But what about Lodi? Avoid the po-po
Always hot boxing when I'm headed to Fresno
Back up [?] Fremont and Berkeley
Santa Cruz EPA gets their muthafucin' hands dirty
San Leandro, they stack that green
And I heard down in Hayward they gets the stream
Everybody wanna live the glamorous life
Rest in peace to the [?] who he gon' rep the shit like
(hey Ren, what they talking 'bout?)
