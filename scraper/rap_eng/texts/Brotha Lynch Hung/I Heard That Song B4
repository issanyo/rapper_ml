[Intro]
Sick till I mothafuckin' die!
Let me get a little strange
Thing is dang, kids you know thats what it's for, you know what I mean?
Every time I hear some shit niggas sound more and more like me
Makes me wanna quit this shit
Hold on, I'mma do it like this

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Try to find me it's like I'm Chinese
Somewhere in China they minor them niggas die easy
Them niggas winers I make 'em red as the 49ers
Leave 'em dead, cut off the head nigga I'm a potent rymer
I'm a pokish rifle give an eyeful I'm a sniper
Nobody like she cock back snaps like a viper
I'm in to makin' niggas quit the game split ya brain hit ya gang
Niggas dunno what happened look at the picture frame
I'm fifty-one-fifty mixed with cocaine toe maine
Poison em put your boys in there after you get ate they get the same
I'm insane something stuck in my membrane its them thangs
Tummy tuck em and then change clothes change shoes
Range rove your brain froze
They lose they know
I could rip a nigga to smithereens
I snake when I slither in then I'mma get my bitch to get the keys
Ain't that a bitch that nigga sounds like a Mini-Me I'm tellin' you

[Hook]
I heard that song before I heard it somewhere
No other rappers rap like the fo
Is he an impostor i just want you niggas to know
You got a thin roster I'mma eat em up like shrimp, lobsters
Impostors
I heard that song I swear, I heard it somewhere
No other rappers rap like the fo
Is he an impostor? I just want you niggas to know
You got a thin roster, shoot 'em up in they motherfuckin' heads
Impostors

[Verse 2: C-Lim]
Is it true nigga? You wanna feud?
Yeah, this is about you nigga
That’s a truce, but if I spit what I knew
Your career could go poof nigga
You clearly disrespected the homies
What you said was balony
The truth is that you’re rispected by none and
Protected by homies
Cause you a bitch, you a bitch and you a bitch
And I don’t give a fuck who it is
I ain’t new to this
When I see you I'ma take flight like stewardess
Trying deal with this
You gotta lotta nerve
Acting like you put in a lotta work
Did a lotta dirt
They’ll find you murked
But your head missing and your body burnt
Cause a lotta worth that you steal are mines
I don' ask much, they say I ride
They say I’m flick, they say I died
But everything that they said are lies
And you [?] Brotha Lynch Hung
Niggas know where you get your shit from
That ain’t a biz homie, we was the shit homie
And you flipped on us like a flip phone
And you missed on a nigga that’s made sick
Every nigga in the click bang it
And it wasn’t [?] strange
Fuck rap, we could arrange shit
Fuck that we could rearrange cribs
When I [?] you see the flame lit
Stuff crackin in the [?]
Trying come back with my name in it

[Hook]
I heard that song before I heard it somewhere

Is he an impostor i just want you niggas to know
You got a thin roster I'mma eat em up like shrimp, lobsters
Impostors

Is he an impostor? I just want you niggas to know
You got a thin roster, shoot 'em up in they motherfuckin' heads

[Verse 3: Tall Cann G]
Nigga this a Madesicc, we got ‘em all sick
Fall back quick, rather stick it to the basic
You’re gonna get left faceless
Got a gangsta in your face
I get up close and personal, stick you with random
I’ll pick 'em, can’t be choosy, load the Uzi
Put the whole banana clip up in your booty
Speaking on the may, nigga you is a real bitch
Off some cocky shit
I got the hockey mask on
Chases through the woods nigga
Let you have it in the hood nigga
Anywhere I’m good nigga
Off the dome, I’m on your dome
Deer hunter, skinning and gutting
Concrete jungle, all the wilderness
21st regarding niggas and animals
Heat you up a lot, jumping in the fry pan
I still fry your guts like [?]
Then take my medication, ain’t no hesitation
I been on the [?], pushing the [?]
Nigga don’t even cross [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 4: COS]
Shit, I’m made sick, sick in the head
Spit with the lead
‘Til the nigga blood stick to the bed
Zip what they say
They’ll be talking too much
They’ll never shut up
'Til their pupil out, I’m choking 'em up
Cleaning their blood up, nigga what up
I’m nutter, I leave a nigga cut up
I hit a nigga crib up and head of nigga cut off
I stick a nigga slut up
I make her spill her bladder
Them niggas call me cute but I split a nigga lover
Put murder on the loop
I hit a loot then throw the cup up
Them niggas sweet as fruit
Their talking too gon’ get you fucked up
I’m nothing like your dude
I’m not a perv, I don’t just flash it
I put it out on, blast it
‘Til they’re closing the casket
I bloody up the mattress
You shouldn’t play with matches
That shit will get you burned up
Burn your face up like some acid
To do up in this exit
You niggas made me that sick
Like I need extra pills
And extra bottles just to heck it
Or I'ma use the hatchet
Get blood along my jacket
Get hop up in a getaway
And swing it like a racket
Them voices in my head just keep screaming it’s a wrecking
And they gon’ drive me crazy, double crazy, maniac-ish
