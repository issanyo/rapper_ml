[Intro: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Dinner and a Movie!
I'm back, nigga
That's what it is

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Yeah, I might as well get wet, give me a Newport
I'm a little Strange now, on fire like a human torch
Just gettin' warmed up, ain't nobody can fuck with me
Even luckily, get cut in three, I'm a fuckin' beast, I tuck a .3-
-57, and it keeps me revvin' Mr. Techron
Pure white cocaine spit not even stepped on
Sort of like blue magic, the pussy I stab at it
And stab at it, I'm an addict it bleeds when I tap it
Manic-depressive, and if you test him
Man it's a lesson, plan to get your chest ripped
Damn Smith & Wesson, and it will test 'em
Hand it to Kevin, cannibal sessions
Hand full of intestines, Kansas is with me
Strange Music is with him I think they read little
I still see siccem, from long distance, for instance
I get with him, I spit sick shit sniffin'

[Hook: G-Macc & C-Lim]
Coathanga, throats to a strangla
Your folks get mangled up, cut 'em up from the naval
Put you in the hospital fast, have you wearing an oxygen mask
With the doctors in surgery getting a colostomy bag
Coathanga, throats to a strangla
Your folks get mangled up, cut 'em up from the naval
Put you in the hospital fast, have you wearing an oxygen mask
With the doctors in surgery getting a colostomy bag

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
My whole cigarette's wet, I'm 'bout to smoke it
Get hard like east Oakland rappers I super-soak it
After the crew get over him I'll be standin' over him
With a nine millimeter hit him like a wide receiver like Jerry Rice
Them niggas think I'm weak 'cause I'm very nice
All I do is just think about eatin' 'em every night
So I gotta carry every knife, every machete I'm steadily deadly
His head'll be buried and gettin' cut up, I'll be at the motel fucked up
Blood in my cup with a fine bitch hugged up
'Til my heart get plugged up, I'mma still be in my Dickie shit thugged up
Make a nigga throwin' up blood, throwin' up guts, nigga what's what?
We kind of Strange, nigga we eat nigga nuts and guts
You already know what I eat your insides and break down your enzymes
And take out your insides sniffin'

[Hook: G-Macc & C-Lim]
Coathanga, throats to a strangla
Your folks get mangled up, cut 'em up from the naval
Put you in the hospital fast, have you wearing an oxygen mask
With the doctors in surgery getting a colostomy bag
Coathanga, throats to a strangla
Your folks get mangled up, cut 'em up from the naval
Put you in the hospital fast, have you wearing an oxygen mask
With the doctors in surgery getting a colostomy bag

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
I need a cigarette, I cut a nigga neck
And watch the blood drip out, hit 'em with a TEC
Just like these niggas wanna fuck my bitch, let 'em sweat
She smiles at you and she'll cut your motherfuckin' neck
I hang a nigga and strangle niggas with barbed wire
It's a little strange, but listen to what I desire
I put the tools in their nuts, twist it with the pliers
I'm a hot rod, you a hot dog like Oscar Mayers
I drop logs nigga, shittin' like diarrhea
You get the butcher knife to the eyes if you try to see him
Either that or my bitch'll see you right at the club
And put the woopty wap in ya mug and your grave's dug
I got it made, cuz, makin' Strange Music
To listen to and dissin' you 'cause that's how Strange do it
We sicker then hard liquor withya it's no thang
Coathanga Strangla spittin' the cocaine, nigga

[Hook: G-Macc & C-Lim]
Coathanga, throats to a strangla
Your folks get mangled up, cut 'em up from the naval
Put you in the hospital fast, have you wearing an oxygen mask
With the doctors in surgery getting a colostomy bag
Coathanga, throats to a strangla
Your folks get mangled up, cut 'em up from the naval
Put you in the hospital fast, have you wearing an oxygen mask
With the doctors in surgery getting a colostomy bag
