I tried to commit suicide
I had a gun in my mouth and a tear in my eye
Where's my Muthafuckin' daughter at
Thinkin' about the next place I can slaughter at
I know she wonders where her father's at [x2]
I tried to commit......

[Verse 1]
Suicide I had a lot on my mind
I couldn't figure nothin' out
And my momma just died, it's just like
Damn everything was blowin' up in my mind
I couldn't determine what was wrong or right
I'm goin' Madesicc (fo' life)
I ain't the type to bitch, whine or moan
But now I'm in a weird place and I'm really missin' home
Naw metaphorically I'm really missin' home
I couldn't explain how much I'm really missin' home (I ain't gone)
I'm on some shit that 'o get you locked up
Put in the trunk nigga let's live shits fucked up
I remember when I use to sit at home all alone in my room thinkin'
I'm hungry for food, my momma screamin' in the front room
Drivin' me crazy, I feel like jumpin' out the window
I'm itchin' like scabies, cuz my mind's tryin' to play me
And nobody cares, I might as well take this nine mili and die right here

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Life keep a gun
I'm always on the watch-out
Niggas think I'm dumb
'Til I pull that Glock out
Leave a nigga numb
Somebody bring the cops out
Cuz his work day is done
Yeah, he had to clock out
Yeah, I could be the blackout
Niggas really don't want that
Send 'em on the plane wit that thang in his dark black
Plastic and as if I asked it, it came out
Couldn't trust a nigga so I maintain' the same route
Why should I trust a nigga they think wit they penis
Then they wonder why there's friction between us
I'm tryin' to get to Venus; sucka duck you mothafuckas
I could just, just leave it and treat it like another supper
I could just eat it take it how it comes
When it's all said and done we ain't got to wait for reruns
I can't even see cuz in the rearview mirror
Hey, let me get right back to this nine (fuck shit)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey, my life has been so fucked up
It's all on a bitch
Ever since I was 13 I wanted to be rich
Tried sellin' dope; naw that didn't work out
I was juckin' in the creek
I couldn't get my work-out
Too many niggas was juckin' that brought the cops out
Yeah, I went back to the Gardens and mom kept me locked out
Livin' in the regal think' sumthin' illegal
We know how it is when you ain't workin' wit them eagles
Dope money paid for my EP
Tower Records put it on consignment
And I had a sample of Knee Deep
Those days were good days these days is no good
Niggas think I got a million probably cuz I probably should
Sittin' in this tight-ass studio 'bout to change it
Reverse and rearrange it, now I'm with Strange bitch
This better work-out I'm tired of the same shit
So I put it in my mouth, yeah, I'm goin' out
