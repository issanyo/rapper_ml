[Intro]

(Instruments playing, Sicx in the background)

[Sicx]
NIggas always wanted me to die (2x)
Hear it is
You know I be fiending to die
If these walls could talk nigga (2x)
On some shit
Stay siccmade
Siccmade like a motherfucker
Bitch get off me (2x)


2. Marination

[Intro: Sicx]
It's my life
Don't fuck with me
Sick of dying in me sleep
If I could only start all over
Now I lay me down

[D-Dubb]
You know some say
When you get it good
And got it goin' on
It's gone away
Little boy get your head up out the clouds
Don't just live for now
Cause on down the line
The shit still gets foul

[Sicx]
I look and like you as a death [?]
Meets up hell [?]
And though I'm breathing
Its with someone else's breath
God I'm fallin'
Can you catch me
Seem I'm dyin' in my sleep
Try to fade it
But the devils at my door
The clock is tickin'
Can't wake up
Make up your mind

[D-Dubb]
You know some see
No point-of-view will be differently
I got to keep me head above the water (bay-bay)
If its too much to take and I can't hold it (uh-huh)
