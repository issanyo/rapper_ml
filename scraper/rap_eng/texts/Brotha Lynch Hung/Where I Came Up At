Album: The Fixxx


(Where I Come Up At)
This is the valley
Don’t get it twisted up
You can get you necklace twisted off
You can get ur wigsplitted up (Where I Come Up At)
Southside
Til I get turned inside out
You better pack up and fly down south (Where I Come Up At)
Before I get sicc and I split ya nuts
Im mixed with a
Pit bull and a rottwieler  (Where I Come Up At)
A shot calla
Yall niggas need to
Stop all the
Talkin (Where I Come Up At)
Like yall ballin
Cause we not
Might run up in ya weed spot
With the teeter totter
Take all ya weight
Break all ya yay
Split ya face (Where I Come Up At)
With a concussion
Roll up with no discussion
Bustin
Just in
It time
I got you for ya mind
Now Im headed back out to (Where I Come Up At)
I fly to
Sacramento
Some call it
Sac of indo
Some call it
Mac a mento
Some call it
Brother Lynch Hung (Where I Come Up At)
Some call it a
Cowtown
With the AKA before you bow down
Lynch by Inch
Ya death
Someone gonna fuck around
Someone gonna buck you down (Where I Come Up At)
Someone gonna cut you up
Someone gonna buck they puff
Someone in the city gonna get with him
Get up

Chorus:
The City of Sac is where we came up at…
Sewed the game up at
Where we learned how to slang dub sacks (Where I Come Up At)
Where we hang with the gang with dangerous cats
We so gone that only the Lord can bring us back (2x)

(Where I Come Up At)
Sac is my City
King Like Mike Bivens
Hot head
Flipped out the Screen and Ride with me
Journey through the valley of heartless sicc men
Where you can get the front door of your apartment kicked in (Where I Come Up At)
Chrome and blazin
Home invasion
Blacks, Whites, Mexicans, Russians, Samoans, and Asians (Where I Come Up At)
Never knowing who to trust so I stay strapped with my four fifth
Home of good guys standoff and livin like soliders (Where I Come Up At)
The Unabomber trial
Coke guys from peru
Dorothea Puente
More vicious than a saber tooth (Where I Come Up At)
With C-Bo, X-Raided, Jeremiah Farms
In Sac even Celebrities carry firearms (Where I Come Up At)
So try to be calm
Out here they do you Bodily harm
And won't let you say goodbye to yur mom (Where I Come Up At)

I see dark clouds overhead
Im wait for the sky to be calm
So I stay out the way and fire the bomb (Where I Come Up At)

Loving this surburban living
But over turf's peelin'
Been doin dirt since we children
And taught to never have no feelings (Where I Come Up At)
Three strikes law for the worthless villians
Sacremento
The capital of mercy killings

Chorus:
The City of Sac is where we came up at…
Sewed the game up at
Where we learned how to slang dub sacks (Where I Come Up At)
Where we hang with the gang with dangerous cats
We so gone that only the lord can bring us back (2x)

(Where I Come Up At)
Every nigga got an attitude like fuck that
Niggas come through blasting
They don't tuck their tail they bust back (Where I Come Up At)
It’s a must that
We keep a semi cocked…
Cuz yu ain't gonnabig flop
Jus in case you gotta run from cops (Where I Come Up At)
Sac. Cali
Where back alleys
Turn to gat galleries
Niggas survive off of Crack Salaries (Where I Come Up At)
That’s how it be
Cops ain't comin to get no niggas outta trees
They got their eyes on niggas like me
You hear niggas hollerin fuck the T.A.S.K
They still hittin brothas with mustard gas… (Where I Come Up At)
Home of some savage ass menaces…
Home of C-Bo and Brotha Lynch and Shit… (Where I Come Up At)
Right in the middle of a killin zone
And if you smart you keep your children home (Where I Come Up At)
Put them in sports
Let them rap
Let them sing
Before the come up sellin crack
Or hooked on methamphetamines

Chorus:
The City of Sac is where we came up at…
Sewed the game up at
Where we learned how to slang dub sacks (Where I Come Up At)
Where we hang with the gang with dangerous cats
We so gone that only the lord can bring us back (2x)
