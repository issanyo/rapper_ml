{Verse 1}
I lied when I said you wouldn't get smoked
Eyes examine the barrel as I watch you choke
Take a deep breath, cause it's your last, nigga
Got any last words? (Sicx): Fuck that pig, pull the trigga!
And that's a present from me
For helping me out the motherfucking penitentiary
Label me insane and the dope dealer
Now add this to your list: a cop killer
You can go on and on, fool
But you won't catch the X when I'm mashin' in the old school
Like someone's pedal mashed to the floor
And passed the hundred and flipped back to zero
Hit 99 and I'm Southbound
30 miles out to get to Sac-Town
I saw a brown Monte Carlo OnStar
To hit the sirens, time to ditch this cop car
Grabbed the gauge off the dash
I said "Get out the shit, or I'm a blast"
Nigga didn't ask no questions
I had a gat, so he followed my suggestions
Face down, on the concrete
All he saw was the streaks that I left in the street
Now all I need is a drink
But I don't got no cash, so let me think
Will I walk in the store and steal on and shoot the clerk?
Fuck it, a beer run that'll work
Got off the freeway, on Foreign Row
Food and Liquor Market, here we go
(Cashier): Can I see some I.D., please?
(X-Raided): Nah, let me get it out the car
(Cashier): Uh, can you leave the beer here?
(X-Raided): Nah, I'm outta here
(Sound of car driving away)
(X-Raided): Ha, stupid motherfucker

{Hook}
Ice Cube: Never should've been let out the penitentiary
Eazy-E: Tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
(Repeats Twice)

{Verse 2}
Rolling down Foreign with a forty in my lap
Gripping a nine, and I'm eager to peel a cap
I'm broke and saw a bitch at the bank teller
I need some cash, how to get her?
Pulled into the lot and found an unlit space
I can't let the bitch see my face
So I crept up slow in the dark
I said don't breathe, unless you wanna see my nine spark
Just like I thought, the bitch panicked
I put the gat to her head, took her cash, and let her have it
Watched her body drop, and then I mashed
Cellmate reached out his hand and said he wanted half
X-Raided just laughed
Looked at him crazy, and said you can't have no cash
And then the nigga got mad
Whipped out the nine on his ass and went blast
Too much cargo in the first place
Nigga wasn't doing shit, but taking up space
He was my celly for a year or two
So to kill his ass was something I'd been wanting to do
He wasn't nothing but a cracker
Doing time in the pen with the Garden Blocc Jacker
The motherfucker didn't know
And now he's dead in the car, fucking with a psycho

{Hook}

{Verse 3}
My dick's on hard from all the drama
So I'm headin' to the garden to fuck my baby's mama
24, the streets I know well
When she see me, she gone be shocked as hell
I knocked on the door and she answered it
I saw another nigga sitting on the couch and shit
I walked in, the nigga tried to act Loc
That made my day, another fool I have smoke
I let him have it, the nigga straight dropped
Then it was time for my bitch to get mobbed
I didn't tripped though, I got my fucking zone
Fall asleep, woke up, and the bitch was gone
Grabbed the gauge, cause I got a weird vibe
Peeped out the window and the cops was outside
(Police): "Come out with your hands up!"
I said "Fuck you pig, and you can suck my left nut!"
Cocked the motherfucking 12-gauge
Jumped out the window, and went on a rampage
Blasting as I hid behind a car
Havin' visions of the mothfuckin' cell bars
I'd rather die than go back, so take that, bitch
I pulled the trigger and went out like a lunatic
Lots of lead from my gauge got discharged
They need help so Call Tha Guardz
