[Brotha Lynch Hung]
Ay, geronimo, domino, I'm sicker than syphilis
Grown ups better get their kids
I can split them bitches to pieces, little Reese's Pieces
I spend my night time ripping out their teeth [?] (Grrr!)
And I put that on my [?] (yeah)
I put that nigga in the trash can and took 'im to the hearse
But I shot 'im in the head first, body bag the bodies
Did that shit clean like a dark blue Maserati

[Ren Da Heatmonsta]
I was taught not to be sloppy, never leave the evidence
I'm nothin' heaven sent, since the call, it's been deadly [?]
Speakin' code, another murderous episode
Way too cold, knock a sucker down off this gat I hold (finish him!)
Kick him in the ditch and shit, get militant
They've been lookin', he's been missin' since
I hit the fence, hit the block and dip real quick
Back to my momma's house, like nothin' happened
Didn't see no action, turn on the news and see if they got clues
