I never once
Backed down from a puch
Well i take it square on the chin
And i found out fast a bully's just that
You've got to stand up to him
So i didn't cry
When i got a black eye
As bad as it hurt i just grinned
But when tought little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into big babies again
Scared me to death
When you took your first steps
Well i'd fall every time you fell down
And your first day of school I cried like a fool
And I followed your school bus to town
Well I never cried when old yeller died
At least not in front of my friends
But when tough little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into big babies again
How one little girl with little blonde curls
Can totally terrify me
If you were to ask my wife would just laugh
She say an old harm about men
How when tough little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into big babies again
I know one day I'll give you away
And I'm gonna stand there and smile
But when I get home and I'm all alone
Well I'll sit in your room for a while
Well I never cried when old yeller died
Atleast not in front of my friends
But when tough little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into big babies again
