{Verse 1: X-Raided}
Nowadays, A nigga gotta be a lunatic
A straight double blind nigga going triple six
Lyricists, Get with this, Nigga I don't think so
Unless you wanna be treated be a damn Skitzo!
I'm knocking them out the box, Get off my jock
Before I smoke your ass like a rock
And I'm a take a serious hit shit
I never will quit you thinking you could fade me, Nigga forget it
I'm on an impossible mission, Like a fisher, I'm fishing
When will you step up, Because I'm wishing
I ain't had to slay in a while
I haven't had a chance to show off my new style
On an insane pearl, Straight Loccing up
Killing motherfuckers, Cause I know what's up
But the X is a nigga taking his time
And if you talking shit, Then you can bite my nine
My finger might slip on the trigger
But who cares? It's another dead nigga
You got a problem with that? Then step up
But be real, we're crazy than a muthafucka

{Chorus: Sample from Ice Cube}
A crazy ass nigga

{Verse 2: X-Raided}
One hard motherfucker, Going loco
You piss me off, And I'm a smoke yo
Ass, I blast with the nine
Double M, The X is insane to the mind
There ain't no cell that can hold me
Be insane, Was what the niggas in Hell told me
That's why I'm going on a rampage
And if I get the gauge, Suicide's on the front page
Sacramento newspaper, All you motherfuckers got the vapers
All on the Lynch Hung dick and shit
Motherfuckers is stuck on stupid
But I'm a killing on the willing, Bitch
And if I get rich, It don't mean I'm a switch
I'm a always be Mafia, Nigga
Midtown hold, Sac Town, We're all there, yo
I know what the deal is
(That's right?) Damn right, I know what it is
And don't let that be the reason
You get your neck broke, Cause I ain't no joke!
Niggas don't understand, One nigga deep
If you wanna jack me, Don't sleep
Cause we know what's up
The whole Mafia's crazy than a muthafucka

{Chorus: Sample of Ice Cube}
Goddamn they ruthless
Motherfucker said what?!

{Verse 3: X-Raided}
X-Raided, The MC, Kicking that hard shit
With the help of Tech, Lynch, And Triple Sicx
A nigga like the X has is going on
Kicking raps to a beat that's pumping strong
The whole posse is dressed in black
Niggas try to step up, And get the Prozak
Cause I'm a nigga that's rotten
For a sucker motherfucker to hold the Glock
X is a nigga from the S-A-C
Homicide came first, But that don't concern me
It's my turn, Like Schizo
But that still don't concern me, hoe
I'm clowning, Damn right I'm clowning
I'm clowning and I'm clowning
Punk ass niggas that don't know
In my language, X means Skitzo!
So little fool, Don't trip, Unless you wanna get the Triple Six
Concept, One more time, Concept!
I say what I say want, Motherfuck your rep
I get it going on, I got it going
Catch myself with a beat, Then I'm flowing
Keep my cash flow on hold, But don't press your luck
Because I'm crazy than muthafucka

(X-Raided talks until the song fades out)
