Light up some shit
Yeah, approaching the middle of the tape and shit, you know
Hope muthafuckas kinda cool, kinda high right now
'Bout to hear some more shit from this dead muthafucka, you know
So at this time, pop off the top of my 40 ounce
And give a shout out to all my homies
You know, the ones ain't living right now
First of all, that Xâ€”Big X, you know
That nigga living right now, but you know, as far I'm concerned
He dead until he's out, you know what I'm sayin'?
And, uh, shout to my cousin King Miller, you know
Got much love, nigga
Of course, a shout to myself 'cause I'm a dead man walking
So, uh, until my nigga Mr. Doctor's album come out
Y'all finish listening to my shit
And, uh, keep getting high and drunk
And listen to the rest of this muthafuckin' album
'Cause that's what I'mma do...
