[Intro]
Worms go in, worms go out..
..little bugs coming out her mouth..

[Verse 1]
Chop 'em up, chop 'em up, chop 'em up, chop 'em up
Cut 'em up, cut 'em up, cut 'em up, cut 'em up
I don't be givin' a motherfuck, red dead bodies in the truck
Time to get another truck
This is my last time, sicker than the ass virus
It's been a bad night, it's, it's finna pass by us
I heard he was a cannibal
I heard he take the *bleep* skulls and eat 'em up like a cantaloupe
I heard he eat the human meat like humans eat the animal
See how they talk about me? I'm about these antidotes
Painkillers, Prozac, muscle relaxers, trust me, my back hurts
Insane in the membrane, nigga, my brain might be on backwards
I'mma get back to work, kill 'em and put 'em in a cardboard box
Brains in a basket
Rumor has it I lock like a mastiff and I got enough zip-lock plastic
Give a nigga that hip hop casket, who can put 'em in a zip-lock fastest?
Me! That's who, shit get thick like I'm molasses
I'mma get 'em and put 'em in somethin' sinister
Dennis, you motherfuckin' menace, I'm 'bout to finish 'em
When does a cannibal, mannibal, animal finish up? I don't know

[Hook] (x2)
I just hate the way things are, I fuckin' hate the music now
Rappers needs to get smacked, show 'em they ain't useful now
They one-hitter quitters, skinny jean niggas
R&B singers, I'm a krocadil meat eater

[Verse 2]
Rip 'em up, rip 'em up, rip 'em up, rip 'em up
Cut 'em up, cut 'em up, cut 'em up, cut 'em up
I be givin' the liver disease, killin' 'em
Turnin' they insides to raw hide, grillin' 'em
This is what happened, I wrapped him up in some plastic
And took 'em home for the acid bath, it was so funny, I have to laugh
These niggas ain't eatin' meat, I beat 'em then leave
Takin' 'em out for cheap, I'mma put that body up
Blood stains in the motel lobby
I'mma probably cut Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
I'm an all-day nut, Friday, Saturday and Fools' Day
I'mma put the 9 milli to your toupee
Clock 'em out, Friday is a new day
Cut 'em out, spread the body over two states
Two labels, nigga, two chains
Butcher knife in a black backpack
In a black Cadillac, make 'em take a catnap
I get raw like Eddie Murph, nigga, have your family hurt, nigga
I put family first, nigga, fuck around and make it worse, nigga
(Push him out the door) Put him in a hearse, nigga
I'mma get 'em and put 'em in somethin' sinister
Dennis, you motherfuckin' menace, I'm 'bout to finish 'em
When does a cannibal, mannibal, animal finish up? I don't know

[Hook] (x2)

Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat the guts up (x12)
Eat 'em (x14)
Eat the guts up!

[Hook] (x2)
