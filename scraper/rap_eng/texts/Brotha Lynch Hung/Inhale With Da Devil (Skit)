Nigga, Nigga fuck you
When I... when I shot you on the last shit, it wasn't to kill you anyway
It was just to see if I was you
You know I'm sayin
If I died when I shot you
That means I was the devil, you know
Based on everybody thought I was dead
I thought I was the devil
But now, since you're here hit this motherfucking shit

(Devil Takes a Hit)

I'm still hearing shit about you nigga
First I hear you was dead
Then I hear you were a baby killer
Then I hear you are eatin nothing but meat and 40's
Nigga you ain't no cannibal nigga
You ain't no cannibal

[Brotha Lynch Hung]

You know I'm sayin
Fuck around and put a nine in your motherfuckin mouth nigga

[Devil]

You take your nine, i'll take my nine
And we'll cock that shit back
You know I'm sayin
And point it at each other
You know I'm sayin

We'll play a little game of Russian roulette then
You know

[Brotha Lynch Hung]
Fuck it, fuck it, lets do this shit then
