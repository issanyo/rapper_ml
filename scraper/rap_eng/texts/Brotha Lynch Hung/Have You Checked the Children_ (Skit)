*phone rings*

[Lauren Brinson + (Brotha Lynch Hung)]
Hello
(Have you checked the children?)
You obviously have the wrong number
Why do you keep calling me?
(Why haven’t you checked the children?)
What? Stop calling me
(Hey, I love that bra you have on)
How could you possibly know—what?
(BECAUSE I’M IN YOUR CLOSET, BITCH!)
*SCREAMS*
