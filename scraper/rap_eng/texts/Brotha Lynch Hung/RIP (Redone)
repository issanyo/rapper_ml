[Verse 1]
I was a dead man, walking they say, so every night I hit the gates
Load the AK and post up, in the window till come day, anyway hey
I feel the pay back simmering in my brain
The thoughts of death cloud my mind As my locs is gone away
Many clips and 24 riches, packed
But really, who got my back
Bang, now that them blocks done hit the grave
I'm killing them off for the old days
24 ways and a 24 sack of that purple kush
And make me sicker than sick and even get Ripgut Cannibal if you wish cause fool
It's EBK everyday all day to the day I die
I'm creepin through yo set with a mini mac 10 AR-15
Ruger with a 12 gauge pump in the trunk and a black beanie disguise
That fool that you can't see just cuz of these Glocks to locs over my eyes
Crept like a black cat with a mac
With a mac 10 in my lap and a fat sack of that chronic
Loaded up that clip cause I seen some fools wit a fo-fifth
So I let 'em have it, ounces of OE 4-0 no doze Indonesian split
And a 9 millimeter for da fool that'll dump and pump and put em in a ditch
And put em in a grave with that empty 40 ounce bottle and don't leave a drip
Then bounce to that ounce in a lac wit a mac and a fat fat sack of dat indo hit
I'm sicker than sick them fools you gotta admit
When I grab my clip you either gone or get caught with a hot one
Fool rest in piasssss

[Hook 4x]
Call me Agent Double O Deuce 4 Blocc
I got that 9 milli Glock and ready to put one in your knot
"Rest in Piass"

[Verse 2]
From the reps of the depths of the double O duece foe block
With a Glock in my pocket full of that sess you betta wear a bulletproof vest
When I'm at your set better pack you a tech
Cause I'm at your neck with a clip full of that rip
Fool don't trip when I put one in your hip
That cannibal hannibal now I got a dead man's blood all over my chest and stomach
Running to the lac with my strap in the back twist me up a sack
And I'm back at the Garden Blocc kicking it with Maniac that's the fool that'll mainly act
Sicker than sick when a clip's in progress
Put 'em on the ground with a brain full of them nine slugs read him in Reader's Digest
Uh I found a new love trickeling in my brain
Half of the doja half of the OE half of the fact that I'm that insane
Fool it's that duece foe blockster
Where fools never put their Glocks up
And get their blocks up loc you just can't stop us
Loc to the brain insane with a main game that will maintain untouchable
Cut your throat and leave you in the street with a lynch around your throat
Futhermucker, Cause you ain't got no love for the block
Pop, kind of hot from that 24 street block
Fool that took a shot rest in piaass

Chorus 4x
