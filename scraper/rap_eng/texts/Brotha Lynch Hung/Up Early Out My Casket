[Verse 1: G-Macc]
I'm up early up my casket
Pull on the mask
Waiting for your family
I'm about to be heard
I'll put your brains in the closet
Side pocket the Mossberg
Left out the scene and I got further
24 street and they call me
Viktor like the underworld
I'll hit you with the stick shift
All through your neighborhood like
Hold up
Make me a Madesicc Molotov
Get out of town
Ill hop out the clothes hamper with a Glock
4 niggas in the back of my SS blacked out Impala
We hitting niggas in fact
I heard garden blocc niggas is talking
About when they see me they are going
To leave me zipped lock up bagged in a coffin
I said
Shit i'll run through your innocent children's room
Snatch them out their bed
Slice open their mouth and neck
Knife up to your children's chest
This is real life gangster
So I came and caught you right at you neck
I'm trying to get famous talking about your brains
All over your bed and dresser
Matter of fact little rip gut's the name
About to clap at you I got the military contact
Like the A-team
Madesicc auditorious regime
Turn off the mic

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
I don't understand this man
This shit is outlandish damn
My nine really scared this man
Then my nine really rammed his ass
He probably loved it
How your whole hood going to turn
They used to love it
Now the only time they think of you is murder
I'm perved up
Ready to murder
So pull your serve up
I don't give a fuck about this shit
Nigga this is crip
Fuck around with me and G-Macc
Get hit with a biscuit
Sick Sicker than Sick
Bitch nigga that's the business
Shoot him like it's physical fitness
Then I passed it
Leave his fucking body in acid they won't find it
Then I walk up on the crime scene right behind it
Even ask the Po Po what happened
Somebody capped him?
Fourth Sacramento captain
This is the lieutenant
We don't talk about who did it
Just do it
Nike's on all blue fit
Somebody's sleeping on me
Somebody's speaking on me
Niggas is tweaking homie
I spit that shit that make blood
Come out your speakers homie
I get the beefing homie
I got contacts who take contracts
Hella people know me
It's like
