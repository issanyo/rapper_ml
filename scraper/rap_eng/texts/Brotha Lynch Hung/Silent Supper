I just want a silent supper
Fuck it, I'm just playing
See the thing is, the dang kids
Y'all don't feel that, y'all don't know what I'm saying about that
Yeah
It's the silent supper
This is what I do
They don't know about it

[Verse 1]
I ain't been gone that long
I'm the siccest nigga
To split you liver and deliver it to your mama
Murder your papa
Stick your brother & sister in the trunk of the car
Aw, naw I eat raw
Niggas don't got no appetite, it's there black and white
My nigga, I called them bitch niggas
Or hermaphrodites
You don't have to like me
Under your bed is where I might be
Get up and slit your throat
And I be getting at your wife
I don't know if I love that bitch
So it could splat tonight
I'm toxic, bloodied all up
And the cops get at the sight
Spidey be at the light
With a machete right beside me
It'll get deadly, nigga
Cuz I eat silence and violence

[Chorus]
Shhh
Be quiet
I'm creeping up in your house with an axe
So motherfucker just try it
You sleeping up in your house n relaxin
And I just need my meat diet, so I'm lickin on my axe
My tongue is starting to bleed
So I'm sticking to the facts

[Verse 2]
They call me Charlie Manson, I got so many followers
Kill for me nigga or come back and get swallowed up
I got you holdin your stomach from what I vomit up
Sum it up like niggas ain't dumb enough right?
It'll get done a rough night
Runnin up on Peter Parker heater sparker
All you niggas bout to need a doctor, hardcore
Now I'm a leave the parking lot
I'ma be where it's dark a lot
See the dark is where I meditate
Butcher knife will make em levitate
It's my job I'm never late
I'm eatin pussy like Kansas City eats hella steaks
I leave it mushy and bloody I eat it right off the plate
Bitches don't push me I'm ugly
I'm stickin it in your tummy
What you want from me?
Took me some time but I turned it into lunch meat
They say I'm sick in the brain
I put my dick in the brain
It's like I'm sniffin the cane
And lookin for chunky beef
Meat eater
A heat seeker
I leak ether
I beat bitches
And leave stitches
And seek riches
Silence and violence

[Chorus] x2
Shhh
Be quiet
I'm creeping up in your house with an axe
So motherfucker just try it
You sleeping up in your house n relaxin
And I just need my meat diet, so I'm lickin on my axe
My tongue is starting to bleed
So I'm sticking to the facts
