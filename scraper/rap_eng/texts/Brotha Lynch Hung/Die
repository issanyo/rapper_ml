(chorus) x2
Die!!!, I choose before you
One by one we will pick you
You will die!!!
(f**k it....psychological)

Verse one:
Siccmade music comin up out yo seat
Catch the reeper night crawler creeper
Dig a ditch get a bitch nigga dig a ditch deeper
I'ma take yo head with this street sweeper
Leave yo brains on yo speaker
Smash off in yo jeep
Do the bitches i'ma get real hostle
Get the signal model in stroddle
Smash down on the throddle
More scratch than lucky luciano
Serve more mutha f**kas than gronnup
Creep up on ya like dunnup
Send on to ya forehead and then like they said I fled
Cause I'm the type of nigga that'll leave a horse head in ya bed
Take ya wife rape her no caper
Tie the bitch to the bed
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
Real lunatic and sicc-fed
And thats some sentimental shit
I just might drip cream from my dick
When I'm off that
Smirnoff gin mix with o.e. I'm hard and wet
O.e. kept tellin' me no
But this smirnoff gin kept tellin' me yes
Mess maker raper
All about my paper
Throw yo hands over yo eyes
As yo thoughts intensify yo will (die!!!)

(chorus) x2
(deep voice)
Greetings..have a seat
Let me be the first to actually greet you to the basement
We've heard you've been busy
Ahaha we've heard you've been busy
We've learn from above that you've been
Doin' a little bit of this

Doin' a little bit of that
Stealing peoples scratch
Stabbin' in the back
We don't think it's fair !
When we found you you were nothing
Now you are our nothing
Is there room for unrest
Die.... you will !!!

(chorus)
I promise

Verse two:
I'm wes craven on paper
So plug yo pussy clips
Cause I get sicker than a sifilous dick
And yo mama won't like my shit nigga
Admit if you was sittin up in yo room hi
Loaded up in yo tape deck ready to write yo tape next
Me I do hot sex
Razor blade and alcohol swarzanigga ceremonial ripsneck
Then I write my shit next
So feel yo insides and yo intestins when you mix me wit
The wisky tell'em situation risky wit a nailgun through
Yo eye you will
I got this endo suckin me dry
I got this slut bitch suckin me dry
Bout to wet the bed up
It was the perfect setup
Bloody sheets (bloody sheets)
No body (no body)
No murder weapon
I got this endo suckin me dry
I got this slut bitch suckin me dry
It was the perfect setup
Bout to wet the bed up
Bloody sheets
No body (no body)
No murder weapon

(chorus) x4
Thats why we die x8

Thats my name don't wear it out
You don't know about my whereabouts
