[Intro]
In my opinion, it's the music these days
These rappers think they can do and say whatever they want
Especially when it comes to drug use
These kids listen to every word they say and apply it to their daily routines
Rappers like Brotha Lynch Hung and Cognito talking aboutoxycotin, vicodin, even adderal
These influences are ultimately going to lead to the self-destruction of today's youths

[Verse 1: Cognito]
*can't open this mothafucka...*
Strange Music, like drugs into your veins music
Cocaine, obtained, deranged, not for the sane music
Sustain the pain maintain popping them things music
I'm a walking acid trip, the drug stains in my brain proves it
Still, I feel EXtra extraordinary and EXtra in-ordinary
Broke up with my EX so now I got one EXtra whore to bury
Actually, she overdosed on EX right after EXcercising
EXcellent, I got some EXtra chicks
Let's see who's nEXt in line
Ten NORCOS in a pill crusher mix it with bombing fluid
That's how Cog would do, rewind it back so you can try too
I got some other methods you can break 'em up and try in food
Cognito, who you tryin' to fool?
You frontin', what you tryin' to prove?
See these parents, see these rappers' images
The bitches' drugs and fringe benefits
AND wonder where they kids spending their dividends
Leaving out the house late, spending money on clown paint
Hate to argue with you motherfuckers, but that sounds great

[Hook x8]
Fresh out the backpack, let me go and crack that

[Verse 2: Cognito]
See it's one bottle to comatose, two bottles to overdose
Third bottle to scare ya, in the hospital with liver failure
Had a ball with Adderal, par meclizine we mixed with coffee
Some might call it syrup, some say liquid Oxy
Some don't know they limits, they start with valium and vicodins
Downers to uppers, then they graduate to poppin' ex
Breakfast, lunch and then supper
Disconnect your spinal cord, keep eatin' em til you can't find no more
You done tried everything prescription, wanna try some more?
You Started poppin' after school cause you was kinda bored
And after that your friends persuaded you to do a line or more
You like feelin' outside the norm, you likin' different kinds of porn
And all you hear is music blastin' outside your college dorms *DUDE*
An oxy and an Ambien and you in candyland
Put your ass to sleep faster than Zany can
I'm the candy man, I got a PEZ dispenser spittin' out rittalin
After 10 of them, feel like I'm a kid again, everybody say!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Yeah, I got a cocaine spit leaving with no name shit
Believe it, I know they spit pills at age 17
They call me Mr. Codine Morphine
I got a bitch named oxycotin, too much of that shit will
Leave your body rottin'
She wanted the whole bag I gave her all of it
She said she wanted the dick, so she swallowed it
She tried to say I raped her right in the back of the scraper
I didn't have to make her, it was a darvocet
So I'm throwin' up the set, putting the penis down her neck
Slappin, did it and did it, you could forget it, I live it
You grab ?minute? you bit, I grab ?minute? I slit it
Put the body in the river, pussy meat delivered
When she eat the liver, you shouldn't of been pill poppin'
I'm on the stage, and you in the crowd still rockin'
Christmas time, put lithium in your stocking
They said he had a mask on, but I was not him
It was

[Hook]
