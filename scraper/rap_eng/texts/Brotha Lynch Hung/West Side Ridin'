[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Yeah and Dre he should've signed me(Why?)
Because I been shitting on motherfuckers ever since '93
Known as that niggas that get you sicc hit you wit sum nitro
You need insurance my nigga go check with Geico
But you can check the sound scan it ain't no type-o
42,000 in a week just Sacramento
Now I'm buying 100 sacks all green sacks of indo
Even though some hate G-Blocc Them niggas my kin folks
End if it come down to it I got confidence
End if I'm going through it Garden Blocc will hop a fence
With AK's like nigga let me tell you something
You touch ours we touch yours we leave your belly cutting
Your family touch'em your gang fuck'em this is are gang
For moving no move nigga this is are thing
You don't know what's going on nigga this is are pain
We turn the game over like it was a card game
Me and,Ehit,Twan Beezy, Believe me
They been holding it down on a bigger level then Weezy
So we going to hold Cali down like Tombstone
You can keep me in the room alone better make it packing who knows

(Chorus)
Because we west side riding
Doors suiciding
Pockets got green rye in them
And always got nines in them
We Still running this shit
Because we just like the Clipse pistol grips
We veterans it ain't nothing we make hits
(x2)

[Verse 2: Mc Eiht]
Before Ice-T made Colors go world wide
I was a young B.G. banging the West Side
Riding around 4-deep I might be the youngest
Handing me the double-up any spot I slum this
Talk shit on tape about the shooting and robbing
In the hood all day niggas we steady mobbing
On the blocc all day niggas knocking the muscle
Since eighty-eight eight know how to hustle
I rock the gang bang boogie never riding the bitch
And rock the hood so well with my cousin Brotha Lynch
And who started this chu-shit you better believe me
Eiht was Straight Outta Compton right after Eazy-E
And it's still a Compton thing we come strapped
Music to drive-by keep the hood on the map
If we the last man standing then it's Veterans Day
Death threats we call out shots shooting the AK

(Chorus)X2

[Verse 3: MC Eiht)
How I still sport a dark blue Khaki suit
With the hood throwing up at my video shoots
Ya'll know I'm classic shit is classic
Get sprung collapse your lung Eiht and Lynch Hung
2 niggas from the West Coast ya'll can't test
West side 'til I die nigga pound it on my chest
Now everybody wanna be a motherfucking thug
But then nobody wanna catch them slugs

(Chorus)X2
