[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Aye, I think I'm sick, can't tell my arm from my dick
Don't be alarmed you slutty bitch, nah I'm just venting
Big game every minute, you niggas go back and forth like tennis
I get cash, put that Louisville slug in that ass nigga
See I don't trust, ready to die when I bust
Imma get a nigga to fry when I eat them guts
(Nigga what'd you just say?) Eat them guts
I turn em, beat them sluts, make sure they don't breath no more
Make sure they don't eat no more
Put em in the back of the dark blue cut
(Put em in the back of the dark blue what?)
See I don't know if my brain's right
Happy then sad in the same night
That crest got when the game's tight, but
But I'm so drunk I can't aim right, hit two bitches in the same night
Nah fuck, but really hit them bitches, then Imma hit them switches
Y'all mad? You better dig some ditches, oh bad, circumcise em, all that
It's that living raw black, siccness in him
You know what I'm saying? I mean I went to the doctor, he told me I might have-

[Verse 2: Ganksta Nip]
No matter what killer I mention, keep dancing
Bushwick, Ganksta Nip, Charles Manson
Karla Faye Tucker, and [?], Robert Durst, he'll try to cut up your chest
From the land there's problems, yea I'm cool with em
They used to live down the street I went to school with em
Before they killed their parents yea I told em man
I don't work that knife yea I show demand
My bad, I ain't mean to show em that
If they're getting out of jail you can throw them back
The homie [?] used to swing that bat
The same way Karla Faye used to swing that ass
He ran into the church and left five people wet
Cops gave him [burger king?], they ain't killed him yet
AK, 100 rounds, that's what I'll give em
I created horrorcore, that's my Odd-Tism

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]
They tell me i'm a different individual
People call me ridder better be up in my homeland
You can talk about me if you wanna stay
So don't try break my border i'm all alone and by myself i'm feeling no pain
And going in for more games, i barely got like no friends
Talking to myself and people tell me that's a no-no
Put em up against the wicked of the world, little boys and little girls running up on Anybody busting 44s
I saw this shit in slowmo but i ain't wanna go tho
These people looking at me like i got some fucking cool
This really wasn't doing nothing everybody up and jumping i was posted with my son up on The couch on call of duty
Mama used to tell me i was precious cause i'm different used to think it was some bullshit And she only being nice
All i do is sit up in a room with a pen and pad i write i wish i had a grip to end my Fucking life
I'm not like you, there is nothing normal about me it is a blashpemy
You can kinda rise up but you wanna stay you trying to place ya mind giving people what You ask for me
I'm a little different but some people call me gifted and you wanna go and trip off the audacity
I love it when they get to calling me odd, homie i'm a god, like get ready for the masterpiece nigga
Stepping up on me looking at me like i'm a green chewbacca drinking vodka sitting up in a sauna
They don't want it with a bear, do they? or are they gonna go ahead and run up on me if you wanna
So call me crazy, you're just foolgazy, better watch what you be saying when pushing them daisies
Always keep an eye out for shady ones, i got guns and you gon if you pay me, I'm odd
