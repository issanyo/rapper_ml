[Intro]
Blood all over me (x9)
Grrrrrr, grr
Blood all over me
Grrr, grrrr

[Hook]
I was walking down the street with, blood all over me
Saw her in the park, cut her up, split ovaries
Crept up in the dark from the roof right over these
Last three minutes I, learned how to murder
Jumped up in the shower with, blood all over me
Took it in the dark I was fuckin' up, its close to three
Right up in the heart with a knife I tote a 3
57 please don't make me, burn this body, ya

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
You can picture it like a picture on Instagram
I got cooking utensils, I can make you instant ham
Now I'm runnin' around with, blood all over me
Shit I'm with Strange, I got bloods that roll with me
Grrrr, we got Tech N9ne, Kalikos
You can get cut too, body left in Stevie Stone
Yellin' out, "Mayday", lookin' for some cess
Since 1983 your nigga been lookin' for success
Shit, shit it didn't happen now there's, blood all over me
Runnin' down the street with, blood all over me
Had to let the heat spit, now its all over the streets
I spit nasty, throwin' up all over the beat
Nobody catch me, baby girl know the police, ha ha
I'll be out the same night looking for the meat
Try it! Taking a bath in some blood
With some wine glasses and candles that's why they call me Mannibal

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Next day I'm in the car with, blood all over me
Nu, nu, now I'm feeling funny cause the, blood all over me
My little brothers bangin' nigga, blood all over me
The, the, the younger me roll way different then the older me
Back then, it was real easy to get a hold of me
Right now niggas better really get a load of me, grrr
I got a huntin' knife it came with a shoulder piece
You pointin' the finger but no (No) I didn't kill your niece
I gotta run it right, wash off when I'm done at night
I'm way opposite like, having a sun at night
I cut the body in half, wrap it up in a bag
Yeah I done it right, learned from the right
I drink Bud Wiser and cut eye lids up
You should try this stuff, I'mma fry ribs up, grrr
And I mean what I say, finger paintin' blood in your hallway, hallway
