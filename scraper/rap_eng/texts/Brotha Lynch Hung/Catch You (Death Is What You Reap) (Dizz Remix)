[Chorus: X-Raided]
Catch you wit’ ya pants down and maybe while you sleep
It don't matter what you saw, death is what you reap
Catch you wit’ ya pants down and maybe while you sleep
It don't matter what you saw, death is what you reap

[Lynch]
I remain real like my cousin E-Mil, packin’ steel
It's the Southside whorida
Can't fuck wit’ these other siders
Eastside, Westside
This situation is dirty like chopped up nation, so I stay with the best side
Nigga, let's ride (Fuck that!)
I stay solo like a black cat, fuck a bad wrap
I seen it happen to my cousin, I'm like the Dirty Dozen
Wrapped up in buns, he said he was buzzin’
But you know he wasn't
‘Cause if life was free, I would say “Fuck money!”
You can douse me in monkey blood, fill my pockets with drug money
And duck from me
You was a fuck homie, only wanted the plug, nigga
Cut yo’ shit off like SMUD, nigga
I gotta say fuck niggas and buck niggas
Wit’ a passion and keep smashin'
Get away before the task bend the corner
On a mission for rippin’ niggas up like toilet tissue
With the German issue
Now your family gon’ have to miss you
I'm sicker than racism
It's everybody killa, hit you, with the fully issue
Like PG&E, lit you; see me in 3D and get you
Hit ‘em up, get rid of, did ‘em up like dirty drawers
He was a jealous muthafucka
As the story was told, 29 years old
350 G’s in the bank, but nobody knows
I guess it's just that season, I think, when niggas be hoes
Fuckin’ ‘em in the cheap mo-mo’s
Leavin’ ‘em dead in the bathtub with no clothes
Razorbladed Grove

[Chorus: X-Raided]
Catch you wit’ ya pants down and maybe while you sleep
It don't matter what you saw, death is what you reap
Catch you wit’ ya pants down and maybe while you sleep
It don't matter what you saw, death is what you reap
Catch you wit’ ya pants down and maybe while you sleep
It don't matter what you saw, death is what you reap
Catch you wit’ ya pants down and maybe while you sleep
It don't matter what you saw, death is what you reap
