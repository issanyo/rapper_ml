You could sleep if you wanna, them niggas is gonas
Don't make me eat this microphone up, cut ya cojones
Roll on you like Daytona, let em think what they wanna
But they won't say it  in fronta, they know I'm the hunta, killa!
With the nine milla them graveyards gon fill up
If I gotta get my skrill about heatin your ville up
I'm still livin' rough, blue dickies and chucks
And I got the Ese homies that'll give me the stuff
Then I run up in ya hut, I'm a mothafuckin' nut
Nigga that love to tuck the stuff, use it when times get rough
Usually when times get rough shit I start the thinkin'
If you wanna test the spitz betta start the thinkin'
Better spark the engine, fool I'm fast and furious
And you niggas is bitches be on them thirty day periods
Psssss spyda man, I can make you niggas follow me like a pied piper can
Ya you betta think about it 'fo yo body stink about it
Siccmade, we do you like cable we reroute it
Just read about it, first you see the power lodged in the gun powder
Just gimme just one hour and ya done daughter
Just give me the four fiva and I'm goin' rida
DJ epic scratchin' it up like a tiga
I spit fire like a big lighter, I'm raw tighter, come and getchya nuts fried up
Tha spyda

You can leak if you wanna speak on a nigga
We can take it to the back, I put a G on a nigga
House to whole house, put a lean on a nigga
Lean out the chevy machines, black with heavy with impact
Deadly rhymes to wear, time for bed, two in the head
I spit ya till I'm blue in the head
Ya doin' the death dance and I'm runnin' off with red hands
I was too close but don't worry, he's toast
I got it poppin' the most and I probably go the hottest spot on the coast
Spyda man locc
Supply the man dope shit, and I hit him with the fo fifth if he blow shit
Cuz you know shit get drastic, bodies wrapped in plastic
Masarati get blasted, kamikaze ta-tactics
That's how it goes, shit. Psss I'm outta here smooth as lotion
Tha Spyda
