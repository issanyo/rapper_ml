[Lynch]
It's the Hunta Killer, off of the 9 skrilla
Wit’ my napsack full’a pill’a
Nigga worse than the movie Thrilla and real’a
‘Cause this is real life (That's right)
I saw that nigga get his head tore off (By who?)
By the same nigga that took his wife
You know I come nutty stingin’ like syphilis
You can get your liver split
By your own bitch fuckin’ with this
Stay drunk when I dip and clips ain't shit
I got vast amount
Your ass could count ‘em
When I'm shootin’ ‘em down your bitch's mouth
(‘Cause this the) Hunter Killer deal a lot and fuck in them shit shoes
(With the what?) With the nine and watchin’ a bloody nut come out every time
And you know it's mine
When I come through loomin’ with the MK-1
And when they done, they lookin’ like sushi (Raw!)
With the Uzi, I get the shit done
You know it's like Velcro or Poly-Grip
I stick to the shit that’ll make you nut up with your dome split
I want you to trip
And I'll be sittin’ right there wit’ the casket (You know!)
You was in the wrong place at the right time then you got blasted
(You hoe!) Hunta Killer and black Mac-10 in the trunk with the slump
I hug it like mama
When I use it, it gotta be because I be off that juicy shit
Not used to it, I'm addicted to the siccness
Might flip this nigga shit frequently
Them young G's, they wanna speak to me
(But what?) But they don't need to be
I'll have they hat quick, with no practice
Put you in the trunk with the slump, stickin’ ‘em like a cactus
And I'm concentratin’ on stackin’ grip
I gotsta hit you with the slug, no love
Bitch ass nigga, you know, it's Hunter Killa (That's real’a)


[Chorus]
Put you in duct tape and leave you sinkin’ in the river
(Hunter Killa! Killa! Killa! Killa!)
Put you in duct tape and leave you sinkin’ in the river
(Hunter Killa! Killa! Killa! Killa!)
Put you in duct tape and leave you sinkin’ in the river
(Hunter Killa! Killa! Killa! Killa!)
Put you in duct tape! Put you in duct tape!
