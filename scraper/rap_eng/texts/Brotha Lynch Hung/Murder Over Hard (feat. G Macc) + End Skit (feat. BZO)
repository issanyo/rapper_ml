I just got off the phone with DJ Cat, Grr!

It was murder over hard like i like my eggs!
Eat em' up, she don't need no muh' fuckin' grave
We in love, me and murder we tight like vice grips!
She don't know the raw like my murder over hard
It was murder over hard like i like my eggs!
Eat em' up, she don't need no muh' fuckin' grave
We in love, me and murder we tight like vice grips!
She don't know the raw like my murder over hard

I guess i'm different i'm grippin' a samurai
I be damned if i spit at your bitch and I am denied
I'm John Allen
