[Verse 1: Loki]
These blackened memories, of taking things to extremities
Creeping through crops of indica when i was but knee high
Laying up in the cut with gangsters, military ??? and ex G.Is, recollect now
Nothing but 80 proof in my canteen, neck to the guillotine, recollect the shit i seen
???, leads me to think they gone bleed me, that's why, my ???, lord believe me
They what don't kill you makes you stronger, but the scars run deep and nights is longer when you can't sleep
??? and the type of company i keep, indo smoking, gun smoking, laced up in straight jackets laughing, khakis sagging
Round about the crack of my ass., smoke until i'm choking, until my throat gets like broken glass
Drinking till i'm not thinking, feeling like i'm sinking, heavy handed, such as it is, this gun never weighed so much
This hair trigger to the touch, one knuckled in my grip, cracking chuckles as i slip, telling my woman "don't trip"
I got this function for self destruction, of which, you can't change Loki for shit

[Chorus: Sicx and (D-Dubb)]
(I got so much trouble on my mind)
(Can't seem to find my place in life)
(Something's telling me that I don't have much time)
(Maybe I can die in my sleep tonight)
(I'm on one)
This entire life of mines got me loccing up off the edge, I don't like to give a fuck
(I'm on one)
Push the button I give up, might as well live up to my name and go to hell
(I'm on one)
My closet demons got me drinking till i blank out, can't stop until i'm tanked out
(I'm on one)
That lost it one to many times, cashing my chips and buy my pine box so my mind rocks

[Verse 2: Sicx]
Let this be my last day on earth i'm tired of this shit, these niggas got no love, none lost
But who can I turn to when the heat gets thick, look around, no ones found
So this English keeps me at bay from EBKing off the hook, swallow my pride, waste my kids, from ho ass mamas i'm dead inside
(let the lead ride)
Give me head, i'm out for lunch, be back at 6, smiley face from sucking my bigger than your's could ever be dick
Struck the ticker, throw hearts in the river, all you morts set tripping
But i'm super nigga style off that Mossberg licking, Now what done nutted up (up, up)
More times than ??? up (up, up)
See i'm spending my last days drunk as fuck its hard to get up, a nigga needs help
To the voices, now i'm seeing objects done moved
Only choice is to get on one cause after your mind you ain't got nothing to lose
And i'm off that super bomb, kill your mom, redrum, coughing up that Luke chapter 8 verse 29 now split my tone
Locked in the bathroom cause the half moon got my hormones acting up
Over ??? are cracking up, hit the walls tough for me cause i'm fucked
??? cut, off what, the hell ever, ??? the storm
Never felt this lost before throw the rest of my life out the door at all costs
Straight ???, can't breath, don't want your rope just let me drown in ???
Don't want to be found, you smell the smoke and the (stinky smell of my brains on my mamma's back porch)
Who would of thought, got caught up in this life or death thang, fought for every thing i had left but still, can't walk
Realistically, zip up the body bag ain't nobody missing me, ??? nigga so drink up

[Chorus: Sicx and (D-Dubb)]
(I got so much trouble on my mind)

This entire life of mines got me loccing up off the edge, I don't like to give a fuck

My closet demons got me drinking till i blank out, can't stop until i'm tanked out

That lost it one to many times, cashing my chips and buy my pine box so my mind rocks
