[Chorus:]
Hard days, hard night
You got to work it out [x2]
You you work those hard days, long nights
You got to work it out [x2]
Hey [x3]

[Verse 1:] [Diamond D]
I tryna warn the crew, motherfucker stop playing
Won't get the fight if you can't make the way in
No more excuses say the man in the mirror
And i see more grey skies than those that i clear
And i'm tryna catch this watch before this shit gets cold
Poker faces read now you must fold
Like sheets and blankets fresh out the Whirlpool
And it drop below freezing in a world so cool
Niggas yell "no sanctions" but be pigeon on the stool
Open letter to yo' self definition of a fool
Repetition as a tool just like a screw driver
Stripped off credit now you gotta play MacGyver
On a court like Tiger tryna fill those holes
Focus straight , gotta pay those hoes
Fees, gratuity and dont forget the taxes
Make ya head spin like the world on its axis

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:] [The Pharcyde]
You gotta get income coming in
We not functioning full power
Feeling the powers in the after hours
They hatin', sour
Cuz they after ours
We blooming, flower [watch]
Picture me rollin, holding
Slow molions big as Samoans
I told my friend indeed I need some
Always blubbing da lowing till the very end
Heading out the red gettin' in the black
No sleep til now, how you feel
We up early, up late on the fire escape
No sleep geta get any sleep
What you think all the coffee's for?
And all the blunts and the herb by the door
Niggas passed out everywhere on the floor
The couldn't take it any more, they fake galore
But we'll be here until 4 in the morning
The morns we got a flight to the Morns

[Chorus:]
Hard days, hard night
You got to work it out [x2]
You you work those hard days, long nights
You got to work it out [x6]
