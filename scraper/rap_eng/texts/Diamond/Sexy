[Hook: Cyhi]
Sexy, sexy
Everything is sexy
This girl I got is sexy
This car I drive is sexy
Sexy, sexy
Everything is sexy
This watch I rock is sexy
This new Glock I got is sexy

[Verse 1: Cyhi]
Okay, sexy sexy, all she do is text me
I know she wanna sex me, she said it indirectly
Sexy, I prefer you call me Prynce when you address me
Shawty I ain't Plies but you gotta give me becky
Especially, if you tryna get inside this Chevy
I'm in this bitch stoned like the man that's on my necklace
Got some sour and some purple and I mixed it like them [Leslie?]
I'm smoking Keyshia Cole, you smoking on her sister Neffe

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Diamond]
Why eat your devil's pie? I'd rather swallow pride
These bitches hating, infatuated with my demise
My swagger on ten, which means I'm on one
When opportunity calling believe I'm gon' come
So all that gossip and fussing, bitch we off that
And while you window shopping, bitch I bought that
And I done drove that, wood grain, leather
Yo nigga chose me, guess yo good ain't better
Built like Coca Cola, sex drive like a Rover
Versace on the shoulders, I made 'em p-pull me over
Sexy is the crime right, walking with my butt up
Causing all that traffic, ass jumping like some hiccups

[Hook x2]

What up sexy
You know you sexy, huh?

[Verse 3: Cyhi]
I met a ghetto ho from the west side, caught her walking out the Best Buy
Damn girl you killing 'em like a episode of CSI
She drove to my crib that same night, pulled up in that X5
Just to get some good dick, we call that a sex drive
Then I licked her neck just to get her wet, from behind I unzipped her dress
Lit the candles then I hit the lights, all you see is our silhouettes
Spent a couple hundred on the bed sheets, baby girl I got techniques
Beat it up til the bed squeak, she can't walk cause her legs weak
Then I came like...

Ugh shit
Oooo ooo
Girl you sexy than a mufucka
And I like that tattoo on yo ass like that
Bow! Cause that's

[Hook x2]
