[Red Hot Lover Tone - Bust Tha Maneuva (featuring Charlie Brown)] [Prod. Diamond D of D.I.T.C.]


[Hook x2]
[Charlie Brown]
Bust tha maneuva, bust tha maneuva

[Red Hot Lover Tone]
Baby let me move ya, baby let me move ya

[Charlie Brown]
(Hey!) Side-to-side, (both) *feel the vibe!*

[Both]
Check it out! Check it out!

[Verse 1]
I'm not Cindy Lauper but "Time-After-Time"
I gotta prove that I'm, swift with the rhyme
I'm giving rappers "L's" to wear like Laverne
I can't lose, ask Tom Cruise, my shit is firm
I repri-mand you, I can't stand you
I got more "winds" than Hurricane Andrew
So "huff-and-puff" but my house is too ruff
I keep "pigs" running when they "bite like McGruff"
You can't test the "Big Bad Wolf" my shit's imperial
Rip more flavor than your favorite cereal
I burn like a venereal (venereal)
So "run the 34 street" and find that ass a "miracle"
For you to beat me, I got more "game" than Neo-Geo
Red Hot wants to warm up, "chili" from that trio
Here I do it smoother, nobody's cooler
Bust tha maneuva, baby let me move ya

[Charlie Brown]
Bust tha maneuva, bust tha maneuva

[Red Hot Lover Tone]
Baby let me move ya, baby let me move ya

[Verse 2]
I'm fabulous, four fools can't fathom the flow or fraction
Abusing more kids than Micheal Jackson (ooh)
Here comes the "action", "kicking" like John Saxon
Pure satisfaction -
You talk more "Bull" than John Paxson
Oh my!
I come to show my
Skills that are so fly -
Like an eagle, so real it's illegal
So take real and eagle, and just call me "Regal"
I'm "Evil" when I make you jump like Mr. "Knievel"
My sound pumps around the corner, ?
Freaky like a Ouija, "rock like AC/DC"
Got flavor like PE, with more "fans than GE"
Your best defense'll get torn

(break and quite rapid-pace rap said almost all-at-once and a bit jumbled together, like his other song "The Illest" and I believe some others:)

Put Eddy Murphy and Beverly Hills give me 48 hours and it'll go delivery is trying to get this raw
I got more funk shit in store
It's the Red Hot Lover on a worldwide tour
Red Hot Lover Tone doesn't soothe, uh
"Bust Tha Maneuva, baby let me move ya"

[Hook x2]
[Charlie Brown]
Bust tha maneuva, bust tha maneuva

[Verse 3]
(Bust it)
Oh my gosh! It's the man that'll squash
Joey and Josh into more "bits than Macintosh"
Beats "pump" like ? (thinking like J. Getty or something)
I hate your style, like Al Bundy hates sex with Peggy
Versatile, let me rip for a while
So serious, not even shawnees? will crack a smile
I al-ways, felt crime pays
Too "Wise" to eat "Lays" and keep a cool hair like Isaac Hayes
More "cheese" than pizza made by Ray's
And when it comes to "hip-hop", I'm a bigger "Source" than Dave Mays!
A's! And across the board, I'm adored
Oh lord, pigs arresting me to rip ni**as trophy shit
I got the funk shit, ni**as wanna get wit
Flowing like liquid, far from a nit-wit (nit-wit)
I do it smoother
"Bust tha maneuva, so baby let me move ya, baby let me move ya"

[Hook x2]
[Charlie Brown]
Bust tha maneuva, bust tha maneuva

[Red Hot Lover Tone]
Baby let me move ya, baby let me move ya
