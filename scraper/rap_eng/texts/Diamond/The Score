I gotta brainstorm hurricane
Till I reign, pour
Stories came and crashed, dames dash
Ironically Jay changed the Roc from Fella to Nation
We just selling vibrations
Till we all celebrate, tell the waitress send a couple cases
Of Clicquot
Three hoes with small waist, just the perfect ratio
I'm bout to skate and mate, well, practice the motions
I got her open, we beast coasting with potent quotes past the margin
I said, the dash toward stardrom gottem selling they soul
I'm pigenoned holed but I pivot
I give it how I live it
Euro stepping, something different
Just expressing, no limits
Guess you didn't get the half of what I'm spitting
Other half don't apply, so its like, "why he did it?"
Uh
I need your effort, give a little
Try to understand the context, the content in the middle
Dig it, my shit deep if you with it
Catch a peep of how we living, Cape Tipping
Listen...

My nills gave me the inspiration
That was instilled in me, the will, to make a way
Outta something ill
Continue the route, taken by many, but only finished by a few
The race of champs, headed to the Cape
White women by the masses
Real-estate by the bay
*feel the breeze*
Smell the potent
Chilling by the ocean, chopping game with precision
In that 93, switching lanes, Master Ip schooled me
To the ways, both eyes on the mission
He's a pro, how I'm drafted, drifting so close
I heard the sun don't shine forever
So as long as its here, then we might as well shine together
Better now then never, business before pleasure

The public understanding of Science. Not Professor of delivering the truth to the public. And these are two different, exercises. One of them is you put the truth out there, and like you said, they either buy your book or they don't. Well thats not being an educator, thats just putting it out there. Being an educator is not only getting the truth right, there's got to be an act of persuasion in there as well. Persuasion isn't always, here's the facts your either an idiot or your not, its, heres the facts, and here is a sensitivity to your state of mind, and its the facts plus the sensitivity, when convolved together, creates impact
(repeat) impact
