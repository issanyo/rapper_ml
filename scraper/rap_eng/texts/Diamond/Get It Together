[Hook x2]

Now you can aim high or you can aim low
You can sit on the bench, that's how the game go
Step up your program and just get it together
So many rappers need to stop and just get it together

[Verse 1: Diamond D]

Too many clowns out with no focus
There's too much dickriding, go ahead and quote this
'Bout to swarm the industry like a locust
If it ain't that purp', you can keep that hocus pocus
Three words y'all need to heed
I leak something every now and then to feed the need
Fuck with my guap' if you need to bleed
Most of y'all only push exotic cars playing Need for Speed
Hey I'm up in the compound mingling
See a lot of long faces like I'm up in Sing Sing
Hey it's easy to hate me cause I'm jingling
I hit every city just like Ringling
And I don't walk around like I'm nice
Big D I wait in the lobby like I'm vice
Thick chicks wanna shake me like I'm dice
Twizzy, on my second wind like Sean Price

[Hook x2]

Now you can aim high or you can aim low
You can sit on the bench, that's how the game go
Step up your program and just get it together
So many rappers need to stop and just get it together

[Verse 2: Sean Price]

Yeah, y'all niggas don't like me now
My bedroom similar to Nike Town
I, cross my heart, Christ strike me down
Put your hands on me, I'mma Mike Tyson the clown
Bastard I'm smart, I've mastered the art
I will, clap at your heart, now master the harp, P!
You backwards, I'm sharp like African art
Get a spare and tear his ass apart
Fuck a dis rap, fuck a rebuttal
Fuck your name, fuck your fame
Man the game don't love ya
Bust the thing, touch your brain
Bad aim my brotha
Love a thing, when you swing
Better bring your rubber
Diamond my man, I'm rhyming with fam
Got Sadat on lock but he shine in the can
When he come home better acknowledge the God
'Fore I .44 demolish your squad, nigga so

[Hook x2]

Now you can aim high or you can aim low
You can sit on the bench, that's how the game go
Step up your program and just get it together
So many rappers need to stop and just get it together
