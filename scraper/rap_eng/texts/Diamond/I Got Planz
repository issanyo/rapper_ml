[Intro: Diamond D]
Aiyo check this out, it's Diamond D get ready
Kick off the real shit in the place to be my man Scientifik
Also alpha man Edo G, my man Buckwild, Diggin' in the Crates
Pure none fly shit, we right kick shit for  94'
So It Do the knowledge

[Diamond D]
Yo I'm flipping on niggas like treys of crack
My raps react on your cardiac like a heart attack
Niggas frontin' for stunts to one
They take a puff of the blunt and play a nigga like a chump
But I don't play that shit with no chicks
Sucking the next nigga's dick, moving bricks
A grown man with the temple
I take motherfucking in shinbone and watch a river
One and one like the now
My crew living foul
Even the older sister knows my style
Faggots man start in baggy
Crack the window like the indo and drag it
Life's a bitch, so i try to get  rich
I cook my crounchy so i be a winner switch
Uptown is where i found if you didn't ship in
Get your lips off the goddamn 40
I'll get out of luck i wasn't dumb
Niggas talk shit but they can lick these motherfucking nuts
It's midnight Marauder chilling with Scientifik
Boomin' out you take to court
No cause for whores i shoot to give to a nice kid
And still get the drawers never slacking on span
Long as I  got my planz, gyea, I don’t give a damn

Long as I have my clams I don’t give a damn
It’s more cash in my hand
(4x)
