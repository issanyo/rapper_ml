[Verse 1: Scaramanga]

Armor-All Star
V-12
Armed We Sell
Top Ill
Pockets Swell
Clock Well
The Knute Rockwell
Monopoly properly high-well
Chopped Ls swift like a gazelle
Bank tellers countin' cash get jealous
Self made fellas
Capped with scars
Gat lift off
.38 caliber
Impact terror mega
Scaramanga pack the Dillinger
Rep-the whole America
Dangerous angular attack with the Mac clips
Taxes stack chips
Bet rap the “back-and-forth”
Like a pendulum
Dollars I emblem
Gs burst out the bank
Plottin' rank similar to a million
An emperor
Pairs of Ace resembles a straight house
Tri-state; high stakes
50 yard line dime, watch the blow out
S.O.T.E
Roll diamonds gold style
Puta
Smokescreen of a chrome Beamer
Cell phone low pose
Team of Os
Creme beam all up in between the seam
Queens' scheme over princes' knots 'n' inches
Plots of winchin'
Not to mention
Got tension in this new cop division to stop the chips
Lock the henchmen
Grand tint, totin' sizeable gold fronts
Pumped up Trumped up trunks lumps of ice
Enterpriser
Polarizer who pulled a live one?
Forced ta' Iverson, Fort Lauderdale and Suave son
There's more to life than just survivin' son.. 1, 2 yeah

[Hook]

[Scaramanga]
Rockin' 24 karats
Start a Kingdom
Bring them to the next level of life
I'm livin' while ya wilin' tryin' to fit in
I'm rippin' with some different
Kickin' elevation
Savior I-Self Ruler
Menelik intellect flock unique
Expertise release another masterpiece
Verbally words'll be issued by your Majesty

[Verse 2: Scaramanga]
Rock land my friend
You stand directly at the Sun dunn
Number one outta' New York City
The crew all gritty
The jewels talk jiggy
The tools cause pity
Group War Committee
Big ball mul'yan
Cut up bullion
Paid the cost for the floss like Forrest candlin'
C-Lo gambler
Money handler
Street scrambler
Godzilla rap crush the Ghammorah
Dust the amateurs
Plus the plan puff afghan (the cannabis)
Lamp 450 Land Lex.. off of royalty checks
Livin' lavish
Gettin' cabbage
From different habits
Pen attack alot
Maverick damagin' the savages
Expandin' averages
It keeps my stamina
I'm plannin' just to marinate
Laminate at a comfortable fahrenheit
Cannons right
Tight on the chrome mobile phone
Global girls taste the flavor like Toblerone
Bone stoned tone
Lace the Jones
Think not? Links hot?
Ice baron with the Brinks plot?
Raidin' the maiden gems
Hundred dollar stems
Paid agent
Paid grave savior
Hair wavier
Read thoughts like Xavier
Darkest Architect watch me lock shit
Rock toxic
Blow like a rocket
The Clark Balleys step It-aly
Heavy weaponry
Malevolently
Excellency on the mic
Game maintain fame
Pass the fast lane
The gat's aimed
Tractor beam team regime
Mac 11s lean in the rap game
