"Mmm mm mm, ain't that something?"
"Damn it feels good to see people up on it"
"Mmm mm mm, ain't that something?"
"Damn it feels good to see people up on it"
"Mmm mm mm, ain't that something?"
"Damn it feels good to see people up on it"
"Mmm mm mm, ain't that something?"
"Damn it feels good to see people up on it"

[Verse 1: Lord Finesse]
Lord Finesse in effect 'cause I rhyme hard
Look good, flow smooth, yeah the whole nine yard
Wear and tear MCs that step near
I make the girl strip naked and just give it here
It's like taking candy from a kid in a baby carriage
Suckers vanish, because I do crazy damage
Crews I smoke and diss, don't even joke with this
Just listen to the sounds of the funky vocalist

"Mmm mm mm, ain't that something?"
"Damn it feels good to see people up on it"

[Verse 2: Lord Finesse]
Now I'm the man with intellect, no one to disrespect
I kick a rhyme and make MCs wanna hit the deck
And give it up and use they rhymes as a sacrifice
Brothers try they best, they ain't even half as nice
They try to kick it by using that softer rap
Me sound wack? Nigga please, come off of that
I'm mystical, musical, I might confuse a few
Lord Finesse gettin' funky as usual
Releasin' some fresh words, sparkin' the network
'Cause I'm the expert, wearin' sneakers and sweatshirts
Jeans and hoods, there's no doubt that I rap good
I walk with a bop with my hat turned backwards
To many I may look like a hoodlum
But I'm a rapper and a pretty damn good one
'Cause I can get smooth and mild or wild like a juvenile
Or get swift with the gift and just lose the crowd
State the facts, create the raps
Those who try to down me, better step out my face with that
'Cause I can get raw like many or any one of them
I take a nine when you rate me from one to ten
I got skills so don't try approachin' me
I keep rhymes in stores just like groceries
Don't try to snap troop, 'cause this man be strapped
Come correct you be leavin' home handicapped
In a straitjacket or a wheelchair
(Finesse lost your touch?) Nah, it's still there
So wannabees and competition
Beware of Lord Finesse – the funky technician

"Mmm mm mm, ain't that something?"

[Verse 3: Lord Finesse]
I'm untouchable, with the skills to crush a crew
When it comes to rhymes it's a must that I bust a few
Keep the crowd listening, I'm so magnificent
It even says Finesse on my birth certificate
I'm the man of bravery skill and chicanery
I get the ladies 'cause I use my brain, you see
And that's no surprise, you might get pulverized
If you sleep, so don't even close your eyes
I go and flow, I even give crews advice
To make it short, I'm crazy stupid nice
Using bad words, pronouns and adverbs
Putting English together just like a mad nerd
MCs I stomp and scare, I make 'em lose they hair
I rip the mic and take it home as a souveneir
Rough and tough 'cause I come from a bad block
Watch your girl with a chain and a padlock
I go solo, far from a homo
That's a no-no, get more sex than a porno
When it comes to rhymes I write my own
Speak in a hyper tone when rippin' a microphone
So those steppin' to me better have somethin' hype to say
I cook MCs faster than you can in a microwave
I'm the type that'll give any man a chance
To come correct before leavin' in a ambulance
So those that's dissin' and flippin' better listen
To Lord Finesse – the funky technician
