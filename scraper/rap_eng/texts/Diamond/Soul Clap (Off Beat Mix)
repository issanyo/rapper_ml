"Clap your hands to the beatbox
Just clap your hands to the beatbox
Just clap your hands to the beatbox
Just clap your hands to the beatbox
Just clap your hands to the beatbox"

[Verse 1: A.G.]
The Giant is greater, so step back
I know you were told, black, about the Soul Clap
And I'ma keep climbin', G, with beats that's fat
'Cause that's Showbiz and Diamond D
Don't believe all the hearsay
'Cause I'ma get the airplay while the fans say, "Yeah, 'Dre!"
And I'm on the lyrical tip
For you to whip the Giant, that'll be a Miracle Whip
So everybody crowd around
And let's all get down to the Soul Clap sound
So pump your fist, here we go
Showbiz and A.G., so act like you know
A combination of the new and the old rap
Me, Showbiz, and Diamond D, yeah, we got the Soul Clap

[Chorus]
"Clap your hands to the beatbox
Just clap your hands to the beatbox
Just clap your hands to the beatbox
Just clap your hands to the beatbox
Just clap your hands to the beatbox"
Ayo, can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
Can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
I said can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
Can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon! C'mon!)

[Verse 2: A.G.]
I love hip-hop, not rock and roll
Yeah, I'm a Giant, and I got lots of soul
I've been a Giant since I was a kid
They always thought I was big from the damage that I did
I roll up rappers like a DT
And don't worry, yo, because the brothers can't see me
Light-skinned, curly hair, I keep dwellin'
I don't care about my hair, my records are sellin'
A.G., my right hand man is KD
Kerry Dope, ya know, Wally World is my little bro
Infinite, he's in effect
Big Ty is snappin' necks, better yet, he's packin' TECs
Yeah, they slepp, they can't quite tell
They know that I'm short, but do they know that I fight well?
Those who diss me, that's okay
Because my jam is gonna slam and I don't care what ya say
A giant in the mental, yeah, you know that
And I'm hittin' with this new one and it's called the Soul Clap

[Chorus]
"Clap...clap your hands
Come on, clap...clap your hands
Come on, clap...clap your hands
Come on, clap...clap your hands
Come on, clap...clap your hands"
Ayo, ayo, can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
Can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
I said can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
Can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon! C'mon!)

[Verse 3: A.G.]
I do work, at any goddamn concert
And if they said that I didn't, then I got jerked
You musta asked the wrong people
'Cause when I make my stand every man knows that I'm lethal
Never back down, my crew's in the background
I get hype when Showbiz lays the tracks down
When I'm finished, you'll say, "He's the mack"
'Cause I'm raw and my goddamn beats are phat
Yeah, I'm a Giant, that's what ya better say
You don't believe me, then go check my resume
I done killed more suckers than a World War
And even more, after a world tour
From state to state, sea to sea
On every continent, I'm a G-I-A-N-T
I'm A.G., yeah, the one you can't hold back
You want your party to pump? Then throw on the Soul Clap

[Chorus]
Ayo, can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
Can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
I said can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
Can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon! C'mon!)
"Clap...clap your hands
Come on, clap...clap your hands
Come on, clap...clap your hands"
Can I, can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
Can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
I said can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
Can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
Can I, can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
Can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
Can I, can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
Can I get a Soul Clap? (C'mon!)
