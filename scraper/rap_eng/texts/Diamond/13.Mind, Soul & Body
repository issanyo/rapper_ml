[Verse: Big O]

Strike 1

What's the word I been livin in this cold wolrd, but I'm still tryna get it with my team whats the scheme cause plottin green but the mainstreem get it Eazy E, that's we're moving ruthless with these tactics see these rappers or MC's we're kicking out without a doubt everybody want the suite life like Cole and Dylan Sprouse but what's the price that come with it, if you knew would you wanna chase for it? but don't get it confused like Kim anything is possible and certainly any evil can be Ron Stoppable it's not the largest who survive it's the wisest how you gonna open up your eyes when we blinded by devices, how we gonna survive in these crisis they sellin souls like they used to sell slaves for prices
So their necks could have chains, it used to be like that back in the days use your brain, we've been warn and been told to beware so prepare cause the devil come in many forms money or a hottie
So you better not lose your mind soul or your body

[Verse 2 T.Y.C]

Strike 1

They want my mind soul and my body, I can't trust nobody Mind me my soul ain't out for sale, I keep God by my side because we live in hell struggle since birth the pain is real, society got us fucked and I ain't trippin I'm tired of living in a place where it's killing on top of killings
And sinning on top of sinning I one day that the lord forgive me for my sinning and my team start winning it's survival of the fittest in this doggie dog world, these cats don't understand its more than the girls money, cars and kickin with tha stars stand back this a young educated brother I'ma tell you one thing a fool wasn't raised by my mother, I'ma make it my way my brothers starving, being the big brother I gotta provide and I will
Ill they be whispering I ain't ever giving in these whack rappers ain't got jack on me Jill I'ma make it to the top don't look down on me
Every child norn pure from the start but the mind is like a blank canvas if I reference art and over time it's tainted by darkness the main reason is these artists phst don't get me started just keep your third eye open, because they out looking for your Mind soul & your motherfucckin body
