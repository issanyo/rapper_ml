[Verse 1]

Where's the love? It's right in front of you
It's everything you wanted so what you gonna do?
Gonna accept, play, or hide from it?
Understand pride is what I cannot stomach
After this best believe it's not coming
All real I'm not fronting

Bout to fade away no David Blaine
It ain't forever like Dana Dane
Even if I tried, nah it ain't the same
100 from the jump, so I ain't the face of blame

The excuses, it's clear what the truth is
Colors revealed like drop tops turned roof-less
Your words I ain't tryna hear
They don't match how you appear
I see through your veneer

Listen, I heard it before
I'm over the lure
Closing the door

A lesson to learn from
Don't push to a point that you can't return from
Especially if you ain't prepared for the worst son


[Verse 2]
I was there for you when you needed me
Crazy how a bond could break so easily
Your loyalty was to your need of me
Guess I knew, but chose not to see
Made excuses for your debauchery
It's a shame, but I guess that's how it gotta be

Guess it never existed
Just void me going the distance
Parachuting & windsprints
Abandon the mission
I see why there had to be distance
Makes sense for the omissions

I should've checked it on sight
Now I sit here & reflect as I write
My oversight was to blame for my slight
I wasn't down for the fight
Tryna preserve what wasn't there
Like vying for a pair of grail airs
To shine like Ric Flair for a crowd who ain't care

Said you wanted it
Gave you all that I got
Then I got dropped & left with a scar like Sagat

[Verse 3]
These are regrets that I live with
Took risks & fell short at the distance
Yet I stood tall, I ain't limp like Bizkit
So understand this is real as the shit gets
I took some Ls but I learned that's the difference
Understand the value of distance
Can't be omniscient, just learn and be proficient
Made it happen with actual interest

Ditto my M.O. calm tempo
Regardless, still got one despite how cold my heart gets
Know it's real, those close know the deal
They see the love & know it's real
Some look back over hill when they realize the blow the deal
Ha, it's whatever ya know
Comedy like an episode on letterman's show

The reality is humanity is my weakness
So fuck ya actions if you don't practice what you're preaching
I'm Gone
