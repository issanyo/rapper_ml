[Wuffman]
Ladies and gentlemen, um, I got your attention, please
Uh, I just wanna—I ain’t gonna say no lies or nothing like that
I just wanna say one thing: I’m fucked up
Can you please give me a quarter or maybe three dollars?
Help a brother out so I can get me a cup of coffee
And a fuckin’ biscuit—yeah, slap some butter on that muthafucka…
