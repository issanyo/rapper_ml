[Part 1: Wordsworth]
Hate everything about you, your life don't apply to me
Your family, religion, your birth[?]
Don't be surprised if I attack you violently
And it's on, a variety, your video's viraly

Never pass words like passwords require me
Turn your [?]
If you apply to me, it should be a hundred grand
To Western Union or MoneyGram, that you wired me

Hated me quietly, invaded your privacy
Like reading it lout loud, every sentence in your diary
[?]
Play tennis, then I'm watchin' "Menace II Society"

From an image, you don't take a minute to admire me
Snap back, shit is shoelaces that attire me
Despite despisin' me, the irony are even when you diss me
You still need words for describin' me

[Hook]
Backstage, more shows, green room, wardrobe
Soundcheck, no [?], packed house, more fans
Bright lights, no time, countdown, showtime
One more for the catalogue. Hey, this be the monologue!

[Part 2: Masta Ace]
Listen, you pathetic man! The niggas think you real
But you fake just like a prosthetic hand
Man, said you was gon' drop
Said, you was gon' pop just like a synthetic string

Damn, still waitin' on your debut
Went through that little money that they gave you
Uh, now you sittin' home, thumbtappin'
Ask [?], he know you've done rappin'

Oh, so that's why you [?] for
Cause you can't get a show, can't get a tour
Now you're lyin' in a rage
And you try to engage in a Facebook/Twitter war

Thus you ain't get the memo
Washed up weedheads shouldn't make demos
Get a job, get another job, get fired
Your carreer is like your passwort, expired!

[Hook]

[Part 3: Stricklin]
Yo! Back in the days, was on the phone with Ace
Hes said, Strick, you're a star! You belong in space!
From that point, I been on a case. Now I'm hot
That's why I walked in a spot just like I own the place!

[?] microphone, you hand me
I'm over-confident and cocky, cause I can be
I got alotta fans I gotta please
From Wisconsin, so I drink alotta beer and got alotta cheese

And tell Puff, I'm a bad boy, but I never sign
He probably do me like Black Rob and I'll never shine
Get it? Black-Rob-shine? Fuck it, nevermind!
That's what I get for tryin' to hit you with a clever line

Cause most niggas want it dumbed down
And when they finally get the shit that I spit, they be lookin' [?]
Should get scared when I come around (yup)
I don't battle. If I did, dudes will be dead after one round

[Hook]
