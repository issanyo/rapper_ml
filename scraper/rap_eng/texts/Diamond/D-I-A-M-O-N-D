[Diamond D]
Hey~! Yeah
Jha, Jha

[Chorus]
D-I, A-M-O-N-D
I am, without no en-vy
D-I, A-M-O-N-D
My words, are B-O-N-D

[Diamond D]
Hey hey (hey) you mighta heard of me
I'm scorchin hot, niggas call me third degree
I get it crackin off the top, urgently
And I'm so focused on the verge to be
The bonafide authentic, head of my class
"Stunts, Blunts" some say I could never surpass
Mami said I got a choice - head or the ass
But I ain't thirsty and sometimes it's better to pass
Some say fat boy got a lot of nerve
Cause I move with a swag, got a lot of verbs
All I know is hustlin, so I gotta serve
Drunk drivin on the Deegan, without a swerve
Cell phone in my right, blunt in my left
Behind the Halton frames, stuntin to death
It don't mean that I'm vain, or want to impress
It's just the way I move I got nuttin to stress
C'mon

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Diamond D]
Hey hey (hey) I used to be like you
Stand behind me like tint, and I see right through
Lookin for charm, see yellow, see light blue
See a man gettin money then you see right too
Ooh, I'm back at it, it's pragmatic
Make you piss in your pants like it's prosthetic
So don't get dramatic, stand at ease
Cause I run with gorillas that'll blam your kneees
Please, the authentic, truck all tinted
You stood around in the heap that's all dented
I'm a hundred percent, you all rented
Keep a stack of Benjy's freshly all minted
Yes, so you can call it what you want
Uhh, I'm at the crap tables like call it what you want
Hahaha, me and the team, haters can't ignore us
I send 'em to the forest, help me sing the chorus

[Chorus] - repeat 2X
