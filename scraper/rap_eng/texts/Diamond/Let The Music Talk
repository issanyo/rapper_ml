[Intro:]
Radio Host: We got Tasha in Virginia Beach
What you wanna say Tasha
Tasha: Good morning everyone
Radio Host: Good morning
Tasha: Just wanna say I’m a huge fan of Diamond D
Stunts, Blunts & Hip Hop
That was one of favorite albums
I consider it a classic
Radio Hosts: Oooh.. yeah
Of course it’s a classic
Tasha: I’m just curious
The production on that album to me was ridiculous
I’d like to hear more production from you
Is there anything out that people can get their hands on
(stuttering) again I’m just saying (echo)

[Music begins]
Kev Brown
They wanna stop the brother from making his music
Kev Brown with...with the Bronx, New York
See if you could stop the movement
Kev Brown yo

[Verse 1:][Kev Brown]
Yeah Uh
Yo yo
Think it’s a game right
Let me get the chance to sign
So you far ain’t bright
Took a little time to write
Diamond D, Triple O G
I learn from what he showed me
Do it how it suppose to be
Low B
My peeps from Cali back to east
Know the steez
Dudes ain’t rapping no more
How the dude that did the beats
Rap more cracker than yours.. uh yours [echo]
And get it cracking on tours
Up with us
It might just open up some doors for ya
Real talk
I see the whole strategy [echo]
Breeze by these dudes with no gravity
Too ahead of them
Leave all the rest second place to grab
Some of the greatest
Hate to brag
Let the music talk
Landover, Palmer Park
Mixed up with the Bronx New York

[Chorus:]
[Record scratching] My man Diamond D
[Sound effects - record scratching]
It’s Diamond D
From the the grounds of the BX came a young boy named D... D [echo 3 times]
Say I’m the champ Diamond D
And you know I got the flow that will never play out

[Verse 2:][Diamond D]
I see the humble, fumble
Trip and stumble
Seen made men break codes
Flip and tumble
Seen fake thugs turn bitch
Dip and mumble
Seen one hit wonders
Make a grip then crumble
Seen it all through the wire cells
I paint pictures of the masses
That’s why it sells
Brought along Kev Breezy
That’s why it sells
Got the angelic flow
But it’s fly as hell
And I’m fly as hell
Coordinated
Ain’t a bummy thread on me (nah)
I bang out ill beats
Keep bread on me
Keep the lead on me
For those who tread on me
For all the haters and parasites
Who fed on me
Look all you get is a few words
Real quick
All you get is a few nerds
Real spit
We on some real shit
You on some Wayne Brady
Let’s make a deal shit
I’ll eat your meal quick
Then watch you peel quit

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
[Record scratching] Diamond D Triple O G…G
[Record scratching]
[?] own as Diamond
[Record scratching] Triple O G
[Record scratching] Kev Brown will throw salt in your veins (echo)
Fade to end
