[Intro]
With the fam
Ok
Yeah
Squizzy
South Bronx
Where we at
Oslo
Ok

[Verse 1: Diamond D]
Check it The all knowing, all glowing
Surf with the globe been jets all Boeing
For the drop I got a fetish
I get a rush when my hands touch the lettuce
We Big Macs, special orders don't upset us
Ladies treat us like chinchillas and pet us
Don't matter what continent or hemisphere
I speak precise you understand when it's clear
The macaroni I smack a phony
Back a homie ex's come back to bomie
Mean swagging jeans sagging
Lean bragging in that Q5 mean wagon
Dead wrong I'm head strong
Fuck with diam's we like to get hating long
So baby see me after the show
Or stay put if you after the dough
You know

[Hook: Devin The Dude]
If you see me in the club you know
The police gonna spot my shine
If you see me in the streets yo
A nigga's all about my crime
If you see me anywhere at all
You know I'm just trying to get by
With The Fam

[Verse 2: Tommy Tee]
A short motherfucker, and large motherfuckers
We grown men your moms wanna fuck us
Puff on the keys go nuts on the beats
So sweet getting puff from the police
Kicks are stole these snares I bought'em
Don't ask for beats if you can't afford 'em
Dude I'm on 'em heading for the big checks
With a couple of big hits you know how that shit gets
Bangin on the mac put my bangers on the map
The plaque's hanging in the back, Studio is dirty
Maybe cause of the fact I never kept clean in that shit since I was thirty
It's Tee and the band Sugarhill and the Gang, (With the fam)
Just me and the fam
It's Tee and the band Sugarhill and the Gang
Wifey in the back, (With the fam)
Just me and the fam

[Hook: Devin The Dude] (x2)

If you see me in the studio
With The Fam
If you see me in the studio
With The Fam
If you see me in the studio
With The Fam
If you see me in the studio
With The Fam
