[Diamond D]
Now, you might catch me at a party rhyming
Talking shit on the mic and sippin' on some Bacardi Limon
That nigga Diamond, prone to shining cause I'm nice
I turn, men to mice walk around with the ice
On my necklace, in the 7, drivin' reckless
Honey you blew it if my CD ain't on your check list
See you should expect this so blow see it's the bro
Who gets the dough, on the low like Piscopo
What you ain't know? Steady flow's my deposition
I bet you wishin you had it but you suffer from repetition
I bet you listen, I catch you slippin on some smoke
Crush your throat, plus your broke, your just a hoax
When it comes to this here, cause this year
I'm lettin competitors know, that wherever this predator goes
I leave foes on the verge, niggas see me on stage, lose the urge
My styles merge together when words come together I splurge
My endeavors on minks, furs, and leathers I use verbs
And better pronouns, you better go now
You don't wanna throw down
Seen how I knocked the other four down
Yesterday, seems niggas had less to say
Didn't wear your vest today, lets just say
Your reaction, resembles a threat
You get swept fuckin with the best kept

(Ladies, help me out now)
La, la lah, Lah, la
La, la lah, Lah, la

[Diamond D]
Hey, hey, to blows my declaration
Financed on mercury speculations
'97's the year no hesitations
Gold and platinum plaques for decorations
In living color I squash the pooh puts
Get vexed, like I'm hittin some new butt
And fade MC's like a crew cut
You do what?, not to the greatest and when you play this
Some will say this, that even after a 3 year hiatus
The kid is still nice with his, tight with his
With no advice to give son, so suffice it is
To say I'm on my way, seeing pay
And you can catch this hombre chillin in Bombay
My palm stay holdin, federal reserve notes
I bet a few of your nerves broke in a tussle
I'm tryin to eat lunch with Russell, flex my muscle
While your busy bitchin, my record label doesn't hustle
Enough for me, it's tough to be in the spot light
You froze under the hot light, and wonder why your pockets not right?
I'm elevating sipping lambrusco celebratin
Through the Bronx, accelerating on crowded blocks
Nuthin about it stops like powdered rocks
Very addictive and I become vindictive
Pains inflicted on foes, thats how it goes
I put the blows, on your weak ass flows
