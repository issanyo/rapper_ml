Uh uh uh, check it out
Straight from the B.X. B.X
Never flex
Beat a man down tell the boys who's next
Uptown put it in your system
And out in Queens put it in your system
And check out Manhattan put it in your system
And out in Staten Island put it in your system
And out in Jersey

[A.G.]
I gave 'em showers, I reign on MC's
The power, will chop the flowers
That make eyes bleed, the all fustrator
Yes, the more than major
If you want it, you get it
Don't stop it, cause we got the flavour
We spread love and we like your style
Don't mean if you act up
We won't act up, WHAT
Been down since park jams
Grandmaster in all of them
Cold crush, shall rock
Plus the other four of them
Now you claim you're real
You're told steel
You wanna test us, you get done instant
Like oakmeal
Now who's next to get dropped
Just like a artist
Who ain't tellin' no records you bound to get dropped
Need to stop, cause you figure you
That you got a bigger crew
Now cypher god
I got some run-a-round niggas too
Come on with that
Gonna know my aunts
That I was born to rap
And peace U.S
I grabs out release my stress
Never stress to impress
With the God U I move on but look back
Fat shout outs to R2
Peace to all my fans
My men's and consumers
I sprayed up those talkers
Whose forced like trade rumours

Uptown put it in your system
Boogie Down Bronx put it in your system
Can't forget Brooklyn put it in your system
Over in Queens put it in your system

[..]
Yo, yo
I scope like Columbo
Pose like Motumbo
And blaze MC's with rumblo, huh
I almost did time over some dumb ho
But I was young though
Smokin' one L, sippin'(?)Cram yo
Niggas is dumb slow
See you don't wanna match hits with this nigga
I smack ya bitch-ass up
Don't need to pull a jigga
I start tres on the mic
You spark lesser
But I pushed it, or pushed with the bar trasher
Stand astounded, I'm leaving niggas dumbfounded
Cause me and A.G. are grounded
And like bum heads constantly up in my face
Bleeding lyrical grease
Niggas wanna be laced
And live the life that's blodged out
You rushed out thought you was crushed out
Now ya ass is brushed out

New York put it in your system
Over in Jersey put it in your system
Can't forget Atlanta put it in your system
GBC put it in your system

[A.G.]
So, I use profanity
That's the frustated man in me
I'm loosing my mind, hit the studio for sanity
Now let's prepare for warfare
You wish you could doubt us or talk about us
The truth is, they all scared
Of the flavour that Show & A. posses
Like a AK through ya chest
I'm steppin right through your chest
Now who's the best?
You withdraw your first war
Finally seen the light
Now Show & A. got it all
Should be bangin'
I'm sayin' never could you fuck with us
Hate playin MC's
That's left hangin' like the Ku Klux
Now that's the truth, Show I love you to the heart
All forwards gotta go and all snakes get torn apart

Eastcoast put it in your system
Westcoast put it in your system
All my croddy niggas put it in your system
All my pretty niggas put it in your system
To the dread heads put it in your system
All the bald heads put it in your system
Niggas with the breeze put it in your system
Niggas with the jeeps put it in your system
Niggas gettin' money put it in your system
All the sides just put it in your system
This side put it in your system
The Westside just put it in your system
The Eastside just put it in your system

Niggas gettin' money put it in your system
Niggas shoot, and die
