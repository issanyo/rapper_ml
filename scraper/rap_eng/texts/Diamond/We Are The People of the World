[Intro:]
Hey yo what’s up
You know what i’m saying
I mean it’s all hip hop man
We just going enjoy ourselves man
(Man put the mic on)
And make some music

[Verse 1:]
Mic and ears
The crowds are gathering
Average, average
Men, women and savages
Just gather around
Enjoy what you see
See what you enjoy
Life is that simple
Middle lavishness
Activist, activeness
Came here to see where the action is
Immaculate swift
Diamond D on the beat
Puts all nation together
And then we complete

[Chorus:]
We are the people of the world (echo)
Worldwide
Worldwide
We are the people of the world
(one world, one world)
Worldwide
(one life, one love)

[Verse 2:]
The object in the mirror
We closer that we’re appearing
Appear and disappear
Just hoping that we can steer
It might sound weird
But the licks are still here
I can real move with dread
Earphones in my ear
I should get tiptronic
But the homie smoke chronic
Gave a gang [?]
That’s why they responded
I rhyme with the best
That’s what we are
The populace
I walk in small towns
And make them feel like metropolis
And ain’t nobody stopping us
You’re rocking with the best
Ain’t nobody drop on us
You’re rocking with the West
Yes yes ya’ll
You’re now rocking with Rico
I used to like the Beatles
And all ya’ll is my peoples

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Throwing up two Ws
We them double dudes
Pull up two [?]
And roll up a dub or two
My passport more like a stamp collection
Three drinks them I’m off to my next connection
Just weaving on the train
With [?] and Ingrid
Conversation started just because I speak English
Have you met Snoop Dogg
Did you know ‘Pac
I told them all yes
Hip hop won’t stop
Where my people at? (people at)
Right there
And over there and up here
Who want a beer
We got a case of bottles
And at least a keg
And my crew stay dipped
Easter eggs

[Chorus:]
We are the people of the world
Worldwide
Worldwide
We are the people of the world
(one world, one love)
Worldwide
(one might, one blood)
We are the people of the world
Worldwide
We are the people of the world [x2]
