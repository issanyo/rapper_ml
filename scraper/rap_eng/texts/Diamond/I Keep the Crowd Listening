Attention (Ladies and gentlemen) We have Lord Finesse (Yeah, it's
Him again. Why don't you get the place pumping, come on, say a
Little something!)

Alright, let me kick this fly intro
Somethin that's smooth but quite simple
This is my type of groove, so don't make plans
I don't care if you hop skip or breakdance
Don't worry cause you'll get your chance yet
To get funky and kick the fly dancesteps
At a show I try to maintain discipline
I keep you moving, but also listenin

Think I'm funky? I'll be funkier tomorrow
Yo, I'm one tough act to follow
Rip up mics when it's time to throw down
Make MC's say: "I don't even wanna go now"
All I need is a mic and a hype groove
Two dancers and my DJ Mike Smooth
To spin the wheels and make you shake your body
I kick a party like I know karate
Better yet like I was kickin a volleyball
I step on stage get raw, then I'm outty, y'all
Here we go now, so just stand back
I take a ho, a cheer, or a handclap
Get raw off the same drum while MC's remain dumb
Don't worry cause there's more where that came from
I'm not the type of brother to kick a small rap
Get swift and make a hit and think I'm all that
Cause I elevate, make the fellas break
I drink a 40, lay back, and just celebrate
Shoot and flip the rhymes because I'm swift and wise
Lord Finesse will keep the crowd hypnotized

I'm the Technician a.k.a. the rhyme arranger
Have old folks saying "Who was that stranger?"
It's Lord Finesse, so don't forget to tell em that
Pass me a mic and roll down the welcome mat
I don't front when it's time to kick a rhyme or two
I get raw and show the crowd what I could do
And steal a show before others have a chance to
By givin party people somethin funky to dance to
Kickin the lyrics and let the beat get them
Man, I sound groovy even on a weak system
I warm up the scene like a bottle of brandy
And if that fails, then I just go to Plan B
But once I start there's no need to slow down
As soon as I say "One two, here we go now"
Rhymes I say structure and analyze
Then say to myself downlow "Goddamn, I'm fly"
Rhymes'll stay when I'm gone like a fossile
I'm livin large, stupendous, collossal
Me and Mike Smooth, we're so magnificient
We keep the crowd movin, but also listenin
