[Chorus]
Aaahh ooohhh! What you gon' do
When you see the Fu-Schnicks come through?
Aaahh ooohhh! What you gon' do
When you see the Fu-Schnicks come through?

[Verse 1: Poc Fu]
I'm coming evil like Knievel, mad like a scientist
Smooth and silky, rhyme are milky than even Milk D
But niggas try to catch it like a Scooby Snack
I'll lay ya flat on ya back like an L.T. sack
It's the P.O. from the brook
Chopping rappers like a chef for real, yo hold up
Na-na-na-na-na wait a minute
I'm super like the man when it comes to mics
I'll bring ya styles of all types more than high top nikes
Catchin' wreck like a tornado comin' through ya area
Ain't no hearing ya, I'll bury ya with mass hysteria
Rhymes Ill like vomit with maneuvers like a chess player
That make me solid like gold
I roll over beats like horses, you better check ya sources
If I was you and you was me I'll be just extra cautions
So what's up ya think that ya really wanna riff
Man I'll run through ya crew like Emmitt Smith so

[Chorus]
Aaahh ooohhh! What you gon' do
When you see the Fu-Schnicks come through?
Aaahh ooohhh! What you gon' do
When you see the Fu-Schnicks come through?

[Verse 2: Chip Fu]
Now ain't I a stinker?
I think I'm, uhh hiccup, drunk
But yo I'm ready, hiccup, ready to c-c-c-catch a punk
And pe- puff 'em full a lead
Shoot 'em till he's dead
And ooh I'll crush his little head to pieces
Yo it seem like I can't let let these suckers pass
So I'll leave MCs suffering like tha tha tha thuckatash
'Cause I rocks 'em, shocks 'em all y'all can lick this
Excuse my french, yo I'm coming like that Grinch that stole Christmas
Now with this, ignite me light me, fsss! boom!
I'll blow up the spot, then screech 'em, aah vrum
Leaving skid, ah, marks, ah, all over this track
Ya ding-a-ling but will and come again
I think my Spidey-sense is tingling
Kid I'm live like at the Apollo, bullet tips are hollow
Time to kill a sound, kill a sound, kill a sound boy tomorrow
When I raps I'm that hard act to follow
You can never bite my style, because it's wild and hard to swallow
So

[Chorus]
Aaahh ooohhh! What you gon' do
When you see the Fu-Schnicks come through?
Aaahh ooohhh! What you gon' do
When you see the Fu-Schnicks come through?

[Verse 3: Moc Fu]
Ahh-oohhh! It's true I'm down with the infamous Fu crew dude
Do I though ya knew, it's visible
I'm surely imperial, I'm golden chosen and quick to open
Brothers up for the year of '94, don't snore
Ya thought I had one style, but kid I got much more
Now let's see, I'm trippin I agree my mind's slippin'
Off and on the track and strapped with a rhyme
A microphone like a gat, an animal that's planning
To get a piece of the action with the traction
Shoot a three point shot like Paxson
Ya askin' nothin' homeboy, I know ya bluffin'
Again and again you're mouthin off saying nothing
So what in the hell you doing here? Are you lost?
I'm top notch, I get props your head'll get tossed
Of course, I'm swingin' shit with force, so what's up now?!

[Chorus]
Aaahh ooohhh! What you gon' do
When you see the Fu-Schnicks come through?
Aaahh ooohhh! What you gon' do
When you see the Fu-Schnicks come through?
Aaahh ooohhh! What you gon' do
When you see the Fu-Schnicks come through?
Aaahh ooohhh! What you gon' do
When you see the Fu-Schnicks come through?
