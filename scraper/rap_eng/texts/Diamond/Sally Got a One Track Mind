[Hook]
Sally got a one track mind
It doesn't matter if it's yours or mine
Cause if ya getting dough and you wanna get with her
Yeah (YOU CAN HIT HER!)

[Verse 1]
I knew a girl named Sally who's tastes were exquisite
Saks Fifth Avenue, bag made of lizard
When she was a child, her parents had money
She was spoiled rotten, and how things has gotten
Worse, she's a professional (uhh!)
She'll start to switch if her palms begin to itch
I watched her grow into a neighborhood ho
Ran around town with every Tom, Dick, and Joe
Quite amusing, but little did she know
That word got around that Sally was down
Sweet 16 but she looked 21
If the price was right, she'll be twice as nice
Dissed her friends for a man in a Benz
Then he cuts you off when he hits the skins
Now you got another one, he drives a Beamer
Wake up girl, don't be a day dreamer

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sally's 19, and nothing has changed
She's on the prowl, her lifestyle's foul
See her at the clubs, sipping on a drink
Playin herself in her girlfriend's mink
Talkin about ("Look at him, he's cute")
Thinkin to yourself does he have any loot
The guy walks up and he says hello
The lights are dim and the mood is mellow
They talked for a few, she grabs her coat
Told her girlfriends "don't rock the boat"
Her girlfriend said "don't go, you just met him"
Knowing all along that Sally's gonna let him
Knock the boots from the bed to the floor
But Sally doesn't think that she's living like a whore
You little hooker, queen of the stunts
You better wake up and smell the blunt

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
21 years old and you have a son
On ya own you don't know which one to blame
There's no shame in ya game
People know ya name from ya neighborhood fame
Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Staten
Black, Jamaican, Italian, Latin
There is no end to you list of men
And everybody know's how ya love to bend
Now you're gettin older and you care about your rep
You're still a hottie butcha try to watch your step
Never been in love, always been an object
Pretty young thing growing up in the projects
I remember when you used to play in the grass
Didn't have breasts, didn't have a...
Became a slave to material things
And now you snack on four chicken wings

Chorus
