Verse 1:

You,You,You know what it is
Straight certified bad chick
She always fresh to death
Like she hopped up out da casket
About to take my style back
You ain't pay your taxes
Ya'll ain't really rappin'
You hoes just actin', action
You hoes better cut it out
You know you see her jumpin' out
Crome wheels, exotic heels
I guess dats wat da fuss about
She can't help it if your nigga wanna take her out
Credit cards
She max it out
She all in his bank account
Da mall is what she think about
So niggas better betta come correct
Cuz she ain't tryna holla
Unless a nigga tryna cut da check
She a red, drop-top corvette, black lace corset
Man dem hoes can't afford it yet

Chorus: 2x

Verse 2:

You know what it is
Straight certified bad chick
She only fuck with niggas
With a wallet full of plastic
Call her a shop-a-holic
She need rehad
Way da classes?
Cuz she be,she be ballin
She can't help it
It's a habit
Somethin' about them Jacksons
Attracts her to them Grants
Addicted to them Franklins
When they wrapped in rubberbands
You know way she at
She stay creepin' with your man
She say money make her come
So she get wetter than a hand
And this is just her M.O
You bitches know she be fly
And while you hoes hatin'
Gone an add a N-E-Y
Been gettin doe
Since knee-High
Now da bread EICY
Big shit poppin like E I

Chorus

Bridge
Now all my ladies
Who be gettin cash
Without givin no ass
You stay poppin all dem tags
Throw the money in the bag
Cuz you a bad chick,now dats a bad chick
Is u a bad chick, there go a bad chick

Now all my ladies gettin' paid
Layin' up in da shade
And trippin' cuz u get it
You know money everyday
Cuz you a bad chick, now thats a bad chick
Is you a bad chick, there go a bad chick

Chorus
