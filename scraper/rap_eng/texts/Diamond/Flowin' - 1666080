Uhh..

I'm elevatin to new heights draped in butter leathers and new Nikes
Niggas who blew fights I knock 'em out with two rights
I'm too bright, for you weak individuals
And my residuals, and me, are indivisible
What the deal, baby, do what you feel
My mass appeal attracts, nothin but the real
Word to Neal, sometimes I just can't call it
I flush your half-ass rhyme straight down the toilet
For what it's worth, I toss my rhymes like a Nerf
You can, witness the birth when my shit hits the earth
Apocalyptic, when I bless the mic and kick it
To be specific, label this here teriffic
Cause I rip shows with quick flows of styles
And mesmerize the crowd
I see smiles across the faces, when I spit my game
Yours truly don't forget my name, now

It's the dough toe to toe, you're dancin with the best
The niggas that'll pull your wig off like Fred did to Esther
But I suggest ya, look alive or duck and dive
Cause when I rhyme uh, I got no time to shuck and jive
Listen, everything that I do's original
Never bit a style cause my man that shit is foul
Now, I'ma bless you, bust a blood vessel
Not unless you had to have that shit I called today's special
I guess you, thought I couldn't rock
But son my rhyme is deadly like the swine
You find in Jell-o puddin pops
While, other MC's talk about they pullin Glocks
Out my, pocket I be pullin motherfuckin knots
I got the, flow to blow like gas leaks
Runnin MC's through the streets butt-ass naked
With reflectors on they ass cheeks
Last week I made an MC haul ass - why?
Cause he didn't check the fuckin forecase
