[Pre-Hook]
Christian Dior, red bottoms up
Valentinos, they be fresh out of Vogue
Shoe game crazy, shoe game crazy
Shoe game crazy, my shoe game crazy

[Hook]
Everywhere I go I'm looking like a shoe model
Everywhere I go I'm looking like a shoe model
Everywhere I go I'm looking like a shoe model
Everywhere I go my shoe game crazy

[Verse 1]
My shoe game crazy, ATL raised me
I've got a shoe fetish, man somebody ought to save me
When I'm in New York, I'm in Dior
Red bottoms in Japan, Jimmy Chu's when I'm in France

[Hook 2]
Everywhere I go I'm looking like a shoe model
Everywhere I go I'm shaped like a coke bottles
Everywhere I go the chicks hate, the boys follow
That's the motto, I'm stuntin' like there's no tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Here's an idea, a yellow bone hottie
Valentino on my body, shoes by Versace
I'm feeling naughty, get a drink for me papi
My shoe game crazy, better ask somebody 'bout me

[Pre-Hook]
Christian Dior, red bottoms up
Valentinos, they be fresh out of Vogue
Shoe game crazy, shoe game crazy
Shoe game crazy, my shoe game crazy

[Hook]
Everywhere I go I'm looking like a shoe model
Everywhere I go I'm looking like a shoe model
Everywhere I go I'm looking like a shoe model
Everywhere I go my shoe game crazy

[Verse 3]
Emilio Pucci, shoes say Gucci
Got a slim waist with a big old booty
Everytime I hit the scene, you know I make a movie
Catch me eatin' popcorn while I'm chillin' in Jacuzzi
He wanna do me, attitude snootie
Louis handbag, Louis tags on the coochie
Giuseppe's got me bougie, feeling brand new
Just got the new Chanel slippers - size 7, sky blue

[Hook 2]
Everywhere I go I'm looking like a shoe model
Everywhere I go we pourin' out gold bottles
Everywhere I go the chicks hate, the boys follow
That's the motto, I'm stuntin' like there's no tomorrow

[Pre-Hook]
Christian Dior, red bottoms up
Valentinos, they be fresh out of Vogue
Shoe game crazy, shoe game crazy
Shoe game crazy, my shoe game crazy

[Hook]
Everywhere I go I'm looking like a shoe model
Everywhere I go I'm looking like a shoe model
Everywhere I go I'm looking like a shoe model
Everywhere I go my shoe game crazy

[Bridge]
I feel so sexy
Shoe game is crazy
You can't fuck with me
Or my Giuseppe Zanotti

Wanna walk in my shoes?
I make all the boys drool
A bad girl never lose
You can't walk in my shoes

I feel so sexy
Shoe game is crazy
You can't fuck with me
Or my Giuseppe Zanotti

Wanna walk in my shoes?

[Pre-Hook]
Christian Dior, red bottoms up
Valentinos, they be fresh out of Vogue
Shoe game crazy, shoe game crazy (You can't walk in my shoes)
Shoe game crazy, my shoe game crazy
