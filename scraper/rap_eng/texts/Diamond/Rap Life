[Intro: Diamond D]
Yeah Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah Yeah (Yeah)
Back up in this bitch
(come on Monch...)

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
Y’all some K-Swiss(ass)
Niggas for real man, I am Stan Smiths
You hate me now you can’t stand Smith
I’m leather with suede tips
You canvas (Rod Lavers)
Lay you out, put you to sleep on the canvas
(come on)
Trying to box with a gun, let my rounds off
I win unanimously, let my rounds off-
In you face cause my mic is a magnum
Naw see me and your chick we go back like cro magnum…
…Man…We did it in the back of yo Magnum
I said put them Lifestyles back give me the Magnums
They love it when I tie them up and I gag them
Sometimes I don't even use rope but I…
She says she loves two when I double up on it
Turn around and put the bubble up on it
Not from the Mile High but she was on the Nuggets
And all I needed was large fries and nuggets
Huh-huh
Hit her with the sweet and sour sauce
Now she can tell a cocktail better than a molotov
P.M
Put her to bed like Tylenol PM
I put her to bed
Everybody now…

[Hook: Diamond D]
Yeah you know the drill is Rap Life
With niggas who nap light
With bitches who act right
Rock the deals where the nigga can actually rap right
There’s a myriad of muthafuckas who ain't wrapped right

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
I say Ricki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo
Chari ari uchi-pip Peri Pembo
Spikes on my mic device slice like Kimbo
Toxic when the pocket lock box like bento
4-4 on cous-in the cut and focus
Exactly - Why fo’cuz?
Niggas that run up on you in these streets they don't love you
These chicken heads just want to kiss you and hug you
That’s why I roll with Diamond Man that’s the bodyguard
I don’t even have to stress how the body guard
Hacking like he made of stone he ain't hardly hard
Feeding you Pedialite with media nutrition
If that’s his meaning of sick then he needs a pediatrician
What the media likes I’m like a media rage
Like unfuckwitable on my Wikipedia page
Huh-huh-ha everybody now (everybody now)

[Hook 2x]
