Yeah
Watch
Uh
Uh-huh
Ay
I want you to take a second
Uh-huh
Breathe
Uh-huh
Breathe
Uh-huh
Breathe
This how I feel
Check it
Ay

(Verse 1)
I can hear the ground when it shakes
From a tree that falls in an empty forest
And I can hear the sound that it makes
It echoes
Life values (?) in your face
So I always know the way a branch sounds when it breaks
I can hear screaming children
On the plane
Before it hit the twin towers in between the building
Its like I was chilling in between the ceiling
Its like I was right there
Where were you?
I hear the last cries of a new born widow
Hearin' the words "I love you" for the last time
I remember seeing my pops for the last time
He ain't tell me he loved me neither
Or hugged me either
But trust me its deeper than a man could take it
He died before he ever got the chance to say it
The world had to take him away
By the can they sprayin'
Have you ever held the hands of a man decaying?
Sometimes I wait for him to come home
I'm mad patient
I've never been to his grave so I never had to face it
He never got to know me
We never got to make it or finished making our bond
So we never got to break it
The only time we bonded when we talked about sports
Instead of saying I love you we just talked about the stars
So I started watching the game and talk about them all
But after he died I ain't watch it no more

(Hook)
Nobody told me or showed me or told me
Nobody told me that life would be hard
Nobody told me or showed or told me
Nobody told me how to hide them scars
And nobody told me or showed me or told me
You could be in love but inside you are lonely
Nobody told me or showed me or told me
When you're dying inside that
Life goes on and on and on

(Verse 2)
I hear shots from the Tec bursting
When the muscles rip I can smell flesh burning
Its a living nightmare
When I close my eyes
He still sitting right there
Right beside fear
Right beside my pride
But inside I'm still scared
But if I cry and wipe my eyes I can never dry the tears
And I can still see each of them shots reach him
And I can still see the gun
I can still see breath leave the lungs of a man trying to scream
And my grandma screamed at the police saying "he's my son"
His dead eyes looking at me
Saying he's my son
My shining star
He's my son
My boy
I look in his eyes and I see myself
He's like me
He's what I'm like when I be myself
A man died with his hands in his pockets
Standing and watching
This man saw the hammer so he ran and he got it right in his back
Like that
(?) popping
I looked right across the street
To the man that shot him
So how do I stop the pain
When its so dark out
With no dark clouds
How do I stop the rain
How come I never cry
And I do not complain
You ain't understand
Cuz you and I aren't the same
Hey hey hey

(Hook)
Nobody told me or showed me or told me
Nobody told me that life would be hard
Nobody told me or showed or told me
Nobody told me how to hide them scars
And nobody told me or showed me or told me
You could be in love but inside you are lonely
Nobody told me or showed me or told me
When you're dying inside that
Life goes on and on and on

(Verse 3)
Nobody wanna feel rejected
You want love
Nobody wanna feel neglected
If you lost somebody maybe you'd feel the message
Life is short
You got real feelings express it
Don't be afraid to express emotion
Don't be like me
I only express when I'm smoking
I don't get to tell them or show them
All the above
I want to ask left eye who you calling a scrub
I wanna dance with Selena
And let her lean it out
I ain't get the chance to ask Aaliyah out

(Outro Skit)
Grafh:
You know what's crazy?
Like even to this day
When I think back about my father's murder
I can't remember anything that happened in that week
Like nothing
Woman Interviewer:
Did you?
(?)
Grafh: That's crazy
And I was going to school and people was like
"You Aright?"
Like people that knew like my friends
I remember like not expressing any emotion
Any emotion at all
Woman Interviewer:
(?)
