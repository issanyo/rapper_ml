[Intro: Grafh]
Black Hander, Stand up! Boom!

Bang Out!

Y'all got beef (We all Bang Bang Out!)
We don't care, my nigga (Bang Bang Out!)
Bang, Bang, Bang Bang Out!


[Grafh]
Holla at ya boy bitch!
Holla may day! may day!
We extort rappers before pay day
And I be on 106 & Park the same day (What!)
Trying to smash Free in front of A.J. (What!)
I hold heaters, it ain't safe (Huh?) (Get that money man)
The chrome nina done got busy like broke phone receivers
(Get that money man)
Blackhanders, stand up (Boom!)
Bitch, rock up cheap
With Knick's the size of Chris Rocks buck teeth (What!)
The clip click, pop up heat (What!)
Got a couple of B's, couple of C's
The only letter we never touch are the D's
(Get that money man)
Get it? Forget it
I'm stuck to the street like gums on my feet
Like uck dat money man, I get it hot man

[Hook] x2

[Grafh]
Hey, hey, hey
We eat that food, you starve when we see that food
I be that dude, that'll rob, you don't need that spoon
Bite the bullet with your weak ass tooth
The heat blast, you fade like a cheap tattoo, you bitch
(Get that money man)
You see that (Woot! Woot!)
Well we can't move
(Get that money man)
I got your girl in my jag drop (What?)
She's my brand new stash box
All in her purse I stash the Glock
We ride right pass the cops like (Vroom!)
Like an express train flying pass your stock
(Get that money man)
Ask not, I be back on the block
Reppin my team like a Mascot (Holla Back!)

[Hook] x2

[Grafh]
Hey, hey
When I'm up, I grind till my time's up
Till the sun shine up, I'm grindin' for mine (What!)
In my momma's kitchen trying to chop dimes up
Until the cops chop my moms up in a line up (What!)
If you need it, then sign up, sign up!
And please don't ask for a dime for five bucks
(Get that money man) Nah
And you wonder why I strive for the bus
Cause now they charge me like $1.25 for a dutch (What!)
I live by the sword and die in a cut
I die when it cuts, I'm a ridah
But who the fuck else gon' supply my lunch?
Huh, Huh (Get that money man)
Ok, I'm a grind till the swine provide the cuffs, bitch!
(Get that money man)
