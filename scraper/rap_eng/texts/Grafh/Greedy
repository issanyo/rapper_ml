[Hook – Chinx][x2]
Dead prezzys on my dinner table, blood type is greedy
Black tints, black shades on, they don’t see me
I’m greedy, it’s money on my knife and fork
Money’s speaking for me, I don’t like to talk

[Verse 1 – Chinx]
Roll around in that ride, deuces on that drop thing
Rolling out of my mind, a noose is what that guap mean
Pac man, eat your money up
Snowflake, pink toes, she just got her tummy tucked
BS is on my arm, pills up in that man capsule
Talking on that bum, little mama let em feel [?]
You need culture, on this side we get you focused
Now kick off them Louis loafers, life’s a trip, I get you chauffeured
Never on your A game, whole life on that B shit
These niggas talking but won’t walk up on that cement
Chinx Drugz, I’m a, I’m a coke boy
Fuck these niggas talking, I got money on my phone, boy

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2 – Grafh]
I got money all on my mind
My money all about more bread
Put money all in your mind
Put money all in your forehead
Jumping out of my Corvette
You be the nigga I skate past
You be the nigga that ain’t next
I don’t need no motherfucking brake pad
I stay past, your fake ass ain’t even in my weight class
I body slam linebackers out they face mask
Talking all of that bullshit
Talking all of that full clip
Talking all of that sheep crap
Talking all of that wool shit
I’m talking all of that wolf shit, drinking out the bottle
My middle finger up, it just came up out of motto
My pocket full of green look like I’m spending avocado
I got beef [?]  like the lettuce in my taco
