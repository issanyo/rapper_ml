(Intro)
Yo
You trying to talk aye
Ah

(Hook: King Charlton)
I don't know if I believe but I still pray (X2)
Please shine light on these dark days
And make a nigga better than yesterday
I don't know if I believe but I still pray (X2)
Please shine light on these dark days
And make a nigga better than yesterday

(Verse 1: King Charlton)
(?) in the hole feel like three days
Running from my pain but I lost my weight
All this liquor and cocaine (X2)
Got a nigga turned up when I'm on stage
Eye contact (?) stage
Dope and the church just fore play
Suck out up my soul and she fly away
(?) in the bait
Everyday I come on late
Trying to find a better way
Its just me I'm a sinning saint

(Verse 2: Grafh)
On the I95 on the interstates
(?) on the state
Momma said "slow down" but I didn't wait
I'm guessing (?) testing if isn't fate
Will I end up like (?) Britney
Or my curse like Bruce Lee and Brandon
Which mean I end up like Christina and Whitney
I'm drinking till I feel the liquor leaving my kidneys
I'm trying (?) pain that I'm trying to run from
Its ironic cause I'm numbing the pain that I'm numb from
Got a bucket list of things to do when I'm (?) some
And I don't get the joy I expected from none of them because I'm from
Well, loyalty is just a tattoo
And every lie here sound mad true
And everybody act brand new
Everything is retro
So everything old is brand new
Shit!

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Grafh)
I heard a little girl had a dream
She wanna look like the girls in the magazines
But in real life the girl in the magazine
Will never look like the girl in the magazine
Everything is all Photoshop
It all exposes a lot when the doors don't lock
Rappers only poses for the photo ops
(?) don't pop when the (?) don't dock
Oh don't stop
That chain made platinum (?) whatever made Robocop
I mean, I don't know what to believe
Searching for the truth I don't know what to go read
I don't know what to go need
I only went to college cuz I was supposed to
I didn't know what to achieve
I don't know (?) or what to believe
I don't know what to give away and what to receive
If you love you get hurt
If you trust you get burnt
When the Instagram likes come become what you're worth
Every blessing I receive come with a curse
Every message I believe come with a church
So I don't care what anyone tell me
I'm done with the brainwash
I need my soul cleaned and my brain washed
I know your TVs leaving your brainwashed
For real

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Grafh)
Goddam
I'm not the man making god out of man
But yall make Jesus Christ sound like spider man
He died came alive and then died again
If the media can't control you then the bible can
They say he got the world up inside his hands
While the devil try to fit the world in a frying pan
Can't even let my mind expand
And keep waiting for mermaids to rise from the sand
Stop
I was raised a proper Christian
I'm not the opposition
Stop questioning my position
I believe in a higher power by decision
I believe in god not in religion
Not in division
That's not in the vision
I'm not trying to confine or find a division
Or decide an opinion
I'm just trying to find where the truth at
If the sky I the limit where the fuck is the roof at
Huh?
