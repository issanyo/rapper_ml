[Verse 1: Grafh]
My name grafh baby I'm comin to town
With the 'NY' sign on the front of my crown
While y'all runnin around, stuck on the ground
I'm in the plane lookin at the wing cutting the cloud
I get to humpin around, I'm dirty
I'm from the bottom, I'm from under the ground Ya heard me?
I like it real nasty baby
Please don't try to keep it classy baby. No
I want my lips on ya skin
Start from yo neck to the tip of ya chin -yabreathin
And when ya start beginning to sing
I'm ready to cum, I only put an inch of it in I like that. Splash
I let it drip til it in
You whine ya way and tryna twist to the spin
Who'd a thought I woulda been wit a been
When I met you on myspace and got picked as a friend

[Hook]
I said jumpoff, hey in my myspace jumpoff, hey
Come girl, jumpoff, hey in my myspace jumpoff, jumpoff Boing
Jumpoff, hey in my myspace jumpoff, hey

[Verse 2: Grafh]
Now show me what you want me to see
Girl, how fly do you want me to be? Girl
I'm superfly when I step on stage
With this allstar to make you check my page
And you love my songs and all the mess that I say
So you sent me a text and I replied 'yes I may' -Amen
Now I read that text
Okay, it said somethin somethin somethin somethin somethin sex
That's the only words that I remember in the text
Started on the keyboard and ended on your flesh
Started with a maybe and ended with a yes
Started between the legs and ended on ya breast
Ooh
Started off textin flirtin, when ya heard make it hot the unedited version
You sent me some flicks butt naked and tworkin
You look good online but look better in person

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Grafh]
Now I'm feelin dry bombs
Grafhblackhand you could log on
But if you wanna hop on you could log on to my balls like my draws got a dot com
My soul rock the color of pop con
Now I'm in the drop with some of the top gone (vrooom)
It might be a Benz or a Jag
But now I'm lookin for some friendz to add
Text me baby send me ya math
So I could hop off the laptop and get in ya ass (Text me)
Tell me girl, tell me ya pass (Text me)
I just wanna suplex and smash
You sexy ass you know (Oh)
Be a drink be a smoke
Tell me what ya like, what ya don't
So when we meet up, we ain't gotta talk

[Hook]
