Not nil nigga not one, no fucks given I ain’t got none
Cops pat a nigga down then spot one

Nigga fill in that blank I be riding till I die gas still in my tank
I be grinding on yo bitch ass spilling my drink
Cash filling my blunt nigga no fear
Best nigga in the game don’t go there, nigga I'm a sniper
Kill em in a cypher, kill em in a boothe

To take money just to make money
And ima make the money that make that money nigga
We making all this noise sometimes I appreciate silence
And hating ass niggas like you be the reason I appreciate violence
