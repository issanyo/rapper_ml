[Verse 1]
I wouldn't care if you was a cheap broad that lean by the bar
You and 3 broads drinking one drink with 3 straws
Like retards Siamese linked with 3 arms
Just be smart sweetheart holla at me
I don't care if ur shoes is on your jewels and charms
Your Gucci is on and your Louis Vuitton, whatever
You lil cute lil movie star I don't care
I don't give a damn what you don't wear, sugar
What's up with that them jeans are nice
I want to know what's under that
From the front to the back, I'm gutter
Try hump hump hump from the back
Like we in the first grade again, baby
I'm on that same BS that I always be on
I pump hardcore you want some R & B songs
I'm far and beyond and on, ah I'm crucial
I am what you are not used to, it's GR!

[Hook]
If you broke as a joke girl (I don't care)
Be yourself home girl (I don't care)
You ain't got to front with me girl
(I don't care, I don't care, and I don't care)

[Verse 2]
I don't care what you wears; under I don't care if you got a weave
Just make sure that it match your hair color
I don't care if your nails are real or acrylic
Cause when they scratch my back I'm still gon feel it
Still gon hit in fact I lay it good
Busting like a cop in a black neighborhood
Hate to see you independent black like myself
That's why I don't hesitate to act like myself
I rap like myself these rappers are so but
They don't pull weight they like broke up tow trucks
So pass the mic now I'm ahead of my time
So these parasites can live off my after life now
So why would I care about your punk ass jewels
When I'm still in the same hood you can't come back to
I like your rims look how they spun back (oooh!)
When I get your car jack you can run that too

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 3]
I don't care how many times y'all been to jail
You sound like a snitch and I think you're frail
I think y'all fail I choose to fix them
If you got shot don't brag Homie you the victim
Now I don't care if you a straight veteran ask your fans
All the songs you makes I freestyle way better than them
Sick, I hate medicine I came to hurt you
I look butt dirty you way commercial
I spit on your stage rehearsal I'm sick
My album is like one long Aids commercial (yuck!)
I'ma take your worst nightmare
Divide it by fair and multiply it by 9 squared
I'm made up what your afraid of I'm here
When your nerves get to jumping and you know I'm there
I don't care if y'all ain't ready for the real
I'm the golden child I done drained the water that Eddy couldn't spill

[Hook] - 2X

I don't care, I don't care, I don't care I don't care I don't care
