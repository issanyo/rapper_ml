[Verse 1 - Grafh]
Grafh got 'em
Life’s a bitch with ass shots mad rotten but I’m still back shotin
Still back boxing in back of the trap Chopin off track jogging with the city on my back squatin'
I'm Sashsquatching and squashing
I beat them into a pizza and add topping
I got em all runnin back hoping faster than Joe Budden have model broads coming back blogging
(Stop)
As soon as she tweets a fuckin cab stopping
I dead her as soon as she plug her laptop in ugh
Ooh boy
I got the game sewn tighter than the pants on a new boy
True story y'all expected me to fall
I am in the building with asbestos in the walls
I’m stepping on your arms then I put my heel under your elbow and lean on it while I’m stepping on your palm
(Snap)
Nigga I represent New York City
The whole world in my hand like two small titties
In a two door coupe with the roof all pretty
And my rim got my tires lookin' Snoop Dogg skinny
Gone

[Hook - Shalone]
Whoa Whoa Whoa this is what you missing in your life it's music
(music)
I heard on the radio its playing
Whoa Whoa Whoa this is what you missing in your life it's music (music)
I heard on the radio its playing

[Verse 2 - Joe Budden]
Go head you try it with a insider
Riot inciter
Who ever think they eating who the diet get applied to I
Show them the cal and how behemoth it be
To you it’s a war
It’s just disagreement to me
I’m a behemoth on the cement when you see him fix yo tone up
I’m coke infested semen all grown up
But when I’m talkin week that means I’m poppin out in Vegas
Move in my own rhythm you won’t spot it on the play list like
They shootin', I mean
Watch them all clear
Finding a shell will be like a needle in Ross' beard
But that was back in my so broke days
Now I don’t even text back if she don’t go both ways
Even then when they drop those draws don’t know if it’s the cargos I wore
Or the Murciélago's doors
Back by the fire pit eating charcoaled s'mores
I’m masturbating with my brain plot hardcore scores
I’m mime not a goon
I got every indication that I be on top soon-
The crib came with a stock room
So here a jewel to those mocking my craft
Can’t tell them my stock raising if you’re ain't watching the Grafh
Joey
