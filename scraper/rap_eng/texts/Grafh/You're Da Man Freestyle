[Verse]
Prick
I came in the game, slangin' the caine
Came in swingin' the thang thang, aimin' to bang
And I came with the Black Hand, that's the name of the gang
I came in a black hoodie cause I came and it rained
And I came with a black mask cause I came for your chain
I judge you by your friends and you came with a lame
I came with gangsta gangstas raising flames
?? say the Lord's name in vain
I came with an airbag because I came changing lanes
I'm in a Coupe knockin' old school Dana Dane
I came for the love, you came for the fame
I came for the mud and I came for the stain
??
Niggas never say that they change but they change
Now you a snitch, what a shame, what a shame
What up homie? Yeah you bangity bang
I don't care if you wear red or what you clamity claim
You ain't a real blood (nope)
Get the fuck out clown
Nigga, I see you throw your B's upside down
I ride with fire but I'm cool with the Crips too
I might be in red, I might be in blue
I got killers on both sides that'll stick you
Black Hand is the gang that I stick to
I got shooters in different color rags
I can rock red and blue, look like I'm covered with the flag
I buy clothes and I'm poppin' a couple of them tags
But I still bring boosters out to shove 'em in a bag
I take 'em out and get a few of 'em spoiled
I got shopping bags laced with aluminum foil
To keep that Chicken Noodle Soup on the soil
Nigga, and that's coke after you let it boil
That's the dream of a smoker with one last chance
And to think y'all thought it was a dumb ass dance
And I don't trust that hand to cut that gram
Even though it provides the fire to heat up that pan
Even in the mirror, I don't really trust that man
I trusted my gun and that was the same gun that jam
I don't trust nothin', let's stop it
I caught my right hand tryin' to steal out of my left pocket
My left hand tried to steal out of next pocket
So I got a straight jacket
But I never lock it
I just rock it for fashion
Cause it's hella poppin'
With some Aviators and some leather Moccasins
When I ride, you never ride and you never hoppin' in
Cause when I pop I make sure that you never hop again
Black Hand is the gang and you will not beat them
My pockets are the color of broccoli stem
Green
You are not a gangster, you can not pretend
You are just a Myspace groupie, we can not be friends
