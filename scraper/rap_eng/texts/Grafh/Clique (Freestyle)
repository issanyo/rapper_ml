[Intro]
Rrrr...
Ay Ay.. My name Grafh ya'll
Wadup ugn! (Boom!) Team Bang Boy

[Hook]
Ain't nobody fucking with my click, click, click click (Pow)
Paparazzi see a nigga and they flick, flick, flick flick (Say cheese)
When your bitch come near ma zipper, it go zip, zip, zip, ziiiiip
Nigga they want the
They want the
The-the-the they want the

[Verse: Grafh]
Playing strip poker at your mom's house
I be in the Gucci store, playing dollhouse
Play em all out, they playing catch up
I be in the louie store playing dress up (nice..)
Pay a check up and I'm easy to talk with
I'm young fly and I'm fresh, easy to market
The label say I need me a marker
I say I'm good with the street, to make it comfy
All I need is a car pit
Each other label, all I need is a target
I put hands and feet on your artists
And beat them retarded, I'm off the leash and I start shit
Yes I did it, this isn't a test drive, is it? (F nah!)
Yes I'm with it & the chances of seeing me
It's like seeing lil wayne in a NY fitted
I chef I whip it (arrggh)
The great rhythm, I'm in the kitchen whipping the white, racism (Ohh)
Pump weight, living uncut baked chicken
Up late, ducking upstate prison
Come fuck with me, couple energy niggas don't wanna fuck with me, (who?)
I get one of them robbed if I don't come up quickly
Look, industry fuck boy, you stuck with me
What if I put one of your names in a rap
And call you all kinds of names in a rap
I don't know who to choose
I should just put all of your names in a hat
And come to your state and turn you into a stain on a nap
I'll abuse you, get the whippin on you
I had a blog saying, why that nigga picking on you
The infrared dot on your head and it's sticking on you
I knock the bitch off of your lap while she strippin on you
Nigga shooting fair one, I'm talking mano in mano
I'm on my Big Sean, I make it y'all wobbly wobble
Wobbly wobble, wobbly wobble, your bitch be sucking me empty
I mean she swallow me hollow, I mean she probably goggle
I don't never respect them, my bitches going both ways
I never direct em, Put em in bed & I stretch em
I take them legs and I bend them, and spread them like an antenna
When I need better reception I be the predator catching my prey
Wit all this bait on, ice hit the leather, look like I'm snapping the crayon
Colors busting out it's just what you happen to skate on
Dead presidents, my wallet happen to stay on
Dead president, I pray for no drama
I look in my wallet and pray for Obama
Argh, you better act your age
Don't go broke, tryina look rich, act your wage
Tell your bitch I might lick her, she might have to shave
Team Bang Boys, that's the way, if you see me, oh
