I always had a dream of being a movie star
I want to dress the way the woman and movies are
I Want to be the shootin stars with the shoes and cars
But its truly hard when you don't know who you are, are, are
I never fit in a popular crowd
So what can i do so my dad and my mama be proud
And friends talk about me when I'm not around
But the pills make me feel like I'm on top of the clouds
They say drugs make it all go away
I swear drugs make it go all the way
Today i got bully it was such a long day
I swear shooting up the school is like the only way
I hope I can trade my soul today for a new one to crucify
You'll pray your car will flip over and you will die
Or that your plane will crash because between you and I, Im to scared to be missed


Hook:
I wish I can feel
I wish I can feel
I wish I can feel again
Touch something real again
I Just wish I can feel
What you say
I wish I can feel
What you say
I just want to feel again
Touch something real again

Touch something real again

2nd verse:
I hate when guy say that I'm beautiful
I hate when guy say that i'm cute
I hate guy tell me that I'm so funny
I feel so ugly
Cause beautiful girls don't stand alone honey
I look in the mirror what the fuck you want from me
I look at my body and feel so disgusted
My ex said i don't have enough tits
I hate my fuckin lips, I hate my fuckin nose
I hate my fuckin hips, so I hate my fuckin clothes
I hate the way it fits, I hate the way it shows
Everything I try to hide away is now expose
When I hear the laughter
Im the one they talking bout
Im the one they talking bout
When I hear the whisper
Im the one they talking bout
I swear I'm the one they talking bout
Everytime I'm messin up
Im the one they talking bout
Im the one they talking bout
Bet you if I die right now
Ain't nothin to talk bout, no
Cause I don't think anybody will notice, no
I don't think anybody will notice
Not anyone at all, no
I don't think anybody notice, notice, notice, no
I don't think anybody will notice
Not anyone at all..

Hook:
I wish I can feel
I wish I can feel
I wish I can feel again
Touch something real again
I Just wish I can feel
What you say
I wish I can feel
What you say
I just want to feel again
Touch something real again


Touch something real again


Hey

Every other day I cut my arm
It's not because I love the pain
It's because i just want to feel something
I wish i wasn't so afraid to just cut the vain
And love is so overrated oh i fuckin hate it
Im never the woman walking on lover lane
I bet you if i die right now, you probably would'nt remember my fuckin name would you
I need someone to love me somebody to care
Im crying inside, Im praying somebody can hear
I mean every other cut is for every time Iâ€¦
I  needed someone and no body was there
I feel so worthless, I just need attention
And this depression surrounds me in three dimension
And when I dreaming I see demons with evil intentions
And screaming isn't easing the detention
Even my parents think i need intervention
I need love
They think i need drugs
I just probably need a hug
Im praying they be the first ones to see the blood
Before it go down the drain, underneath the tub
But i bet they never notice
