Ma job Randy Savage
Fell on it then banging
Big baby cash money
Bling bling bling blinging
Never interrupt me
When round me king kinging

Smoking loud smoking loud
A bag of reefer had a speaker
Gasolina gasolina
Pull up on her pull up on her
Fargo got me big big big pimpin
At a eight crack at her side [?]
Big big big pimpin
They sleeping on me keep sleeping
The heater on the heat sinking
I'm in the streets street sweeping
You in the tweets tweet tweeting
Semi-auto Semi-auto but you keep on taking photos
Snapchatting while I'm not looking
Threw your wifey and the cops looking
While I'm water whipping with the pots cooking
Hard riding cause the block took it
Whipping rock up in the hot pudding
New York eighty eight dash gooding
Call the operator when you want that work
It work the work the work [?]
