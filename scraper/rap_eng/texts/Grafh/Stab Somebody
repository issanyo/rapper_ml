[Talking]
Let it ride out

Let it ride out

[Hook]
Never try to play me like I'm sweet
Never try to play me like I'm pussy
Don't put my manhood on the line
I swear to God one of us got to die
Don't force me to stab somebody
I ain't a killa, but I'll stab somebody
Don't put my manhood on the line
Don't force me to stab somebody

[Verse 1]
I pull my pants up and buckle my belt
I man up, I stand up for myself
I've got two choices, either get blammed up and stand up for my health
Or put my hands up and stand up for some help (I don't think so)
I carry my gat, I carry my clip
Because I'd rather be judged by 12 than carried by six
I'm a man, motherfucker
And right before I swallow my pride, I'd rather die where I stand
Motherfucker
I done been in real beef, with toast to my face, drawn
And I came home with both of my chains on
But I got stuck up before, got jumped plus fucked up before
And you know what
Niggas sent me home to my mother all swollen and broke up
And I came back with the .44 tucked, like so what
What's poppin nigga, I don't lose, I don't quit
So when you wanna shoot the fifth, I'll shoot you in the face

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now I don't give a fuck and I don't give a shit
But I dream that I pop me a nigga
I dream that I see the blood splashin, when I'm just blastin
I cock back and pop me a nigga
Now does that make me crazy or make me insane
Because I daydream of turning your brains into gravy
But I don't give a fuck and I don't give a shit
But I dream that I pop me a nigga, so don't bring it
Because I'm not a killa, so don't push me nigga
I don't wanna see that dream come true
I don't wanna see you starin down the barrel of my 4 (Fo]
While you chokin off the smoke as the steam come through
I've got killas on payroll that'll make ya spleen come through ya navel
When they squeeze, plus shoot slugs the size of an eggroll
Hey bro! Move
Or get your guardian angel harmed and strangled by a part of his halo
Because there ain't no rules
Your heart pump mango juice, you are not real
Don't force me to go pop steel
And throw my life away based on how I feel
Because I've never had a body on my list
I never caught a body because when I popped at somebody, I missed
So don't worry about the shotty I pack
Just don't be the first body I catch, you cocksucker

[Hook]

[Outro 2X]
I'm not a killa, but I will if I have to
Ride by and leave you stiff as a statue
Or I'll pay guerillas to clap you
And leave you dead as a doornail, nigga
