[Intro]
Yeah, Bobby Johnson
Take a step back and look at life for what it is ya’ll
For what it could be
Just feel free
Feel free to dream big
Feel free to be inspired
Feel free to feel free

[Verse 1]
Never be afraid to (afraid to)
Dream bigger (dream bigger)
Reach higher (reach higher)
Cry blood, nigga breathe fire (breathe fire)
The king of rock called me sire
Them weak liars they bleed sweet papaya
We bleed desire
Surrounded by fiends and DT’s with wires
Beneath street attire, sleep I’m never tired
I speak, I’m never quiet
The weak will get expired cause they soul for sale
And it’s cheap under the ghetto receipt but I’m a buy it
Die for the cause if you believe it you should write it
Need to be inspired, do you want to be more
Or do you wanna be a wanna be more
There’s a message, find it, detour
It’s in a letter in a bottle by the seashore
It says you need something to condemn
You need something to believe
You need something defend, don’t you

[Hook]
Oh, slow down, slow down, slow down
Oh, slow down, slow down, slow down
Oh they say we moving too fast
Aye, living life in the fast lane, oh
You see me (oh)
You see me (oh)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Keep dreaming, keep running
Ignore what you hear, don’t believe nothing
Keep giving, don’t give to receive something
Keep wishing, you have three coming
It’s all about that positive energy
It pushed me to the top of my pedigree
I learned how to listen to your aura
Not what you’re telling me
Not who they pretend to be, those lies and the jealousy
I rise with intensity, where I hit the weed smoke
Let my brain waves surf by
Where I look at your soul with my third eye
Tried to find inner peace and failed on my first try
I will not stop, I will not settle
We need balance, we need levels
You need angels, you need rebels
God can’t exist without the devil

[Hook]
Oh, slow down, slow down, slow down
Oh, slow down, slow down, slow down
Oh they say we moving too fast
Aye, living life in the fast lane, oh
Oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 3]
Could you just keep your mind open
You see with your heart and you can read blindfolded
You could see your dreams shatter
And when you see the pieces pass by floating
Just reach out and snatch it out the black sky
Broken, put it back together, duct tape it
A little Krazi Glue will have it up, straighten
Just wondering what’s up with Satan, it’s frustrating
And God and mother nature were lovemaking
And you’re alone in the thunder, sunbathing
Wondering if you’re dunking or pump fakin’
Your whole destiny is up for the taking
Take it baby

Aye, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Spoken]
Pain Killers: Reloaded ah, the concept alone is pretty dope. Like I looked at it like - I look at it like the whole world and my opinion is numb. You’re bombarded with so much shit daily from the internet, to the news - to all the shit to distract you. Violence and cops killing blacks, and you got the internet, you got Facebook; You’re distracted all day from whatever the fuck might matter so in my opinion you are numb to everything that exists in front of you. You can’t even - think about it, you can’t see your nose. You know what I’m saying? You’re blind and you’re numb. So, when you take pain killers and most things, a pain killer designed to numb the pain. You take a painkiller to numb the pain. I look at it as you’re already fucking numb, so now you gon’ take this shit to actually feel something again
