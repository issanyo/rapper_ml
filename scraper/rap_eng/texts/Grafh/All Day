[Intro]
Uh, New York City shit
Throw it down, down
Team Bang Dope Gang
My name Grafh, hoe

[Pre-Hook]
You can get on sight, on sight
Nigga you ain’t in the streets, you on Skype
Nigga you ain’t all that, you alright
Nigga you a Twitter killer, you all type

[Hook]
We be on it all day, all night
We be on it all day, all night
We be on it all day, all night

Live from the back block with the hard white
We be on it all day, all night (gang)
We be on it all day, all night (gang)
We be on it all day, all night (gang)
We be on it all day, all night
Live from the back block with the hard white

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Real nigga, all facts (facts)
Real nigga on beat, real off whackos (whacks)
I pull up in that batmobile all black
I park, run New York and then I walk back bitch
Been getting it before Rap
Way before a record deal I sold crack
Leave them in a triage, been kill em on the floor flat (flat)
I treat your girl self esteem like a doormat (wish)
Whenever I pump it’s much louder (bang)
Nigga my blood pump gun powder
The coke cut up with too much flour (damn)
I’m a New York nigga with too much power
The handsome fellow or the Grafh in your ransom letter
The ego has ways and propellers
Fam I tell them wait nigga, hold up
Cause real don’t recognize real till the fake niggas show up

[Hook]
We be on it all day, all night
We be on it all day, all night
We be on it all day, all night
We be on it all day, all night
Live from the back block with the hard white
We be on it all day, all night (gang)
We be on it all day, all night (gang)
We be on it all day, all night (sheek, gang)
We be on it all day, all night (B Block)
Live from the back block with the hard white

[Verse 3]
Aye yo Grafh we going in
Sitting on my hip but there’s no need to promote it
Just clap and unload it
Chest exploded, my money I can’t fold it
Watch, chain and my house is bigger
I ain’t bragging, if you know me I’m a hoodlum nigga (you know)
Head to toe, flick a weed good to go
Money straight, club packed, perfect show (okay)
Fat ass, pretty face, perfect blow (okay)
I’m writing rhymes, I’m high, I’m tryna get wealthy
IG is cool but ain’t got time for selfies (nah)
B Block been the boss since way back
You ain’t hotter than the locks why the fuck you say that

[Pre-Hook]
Yo can get on sight, on sight
Nigga you ain’t in the streets, you on Skype
Nigga you ain’t all that, you alright
Nigga you a Twitter killer, you all type

[Hook]
We be on it all day, all night
We be on it all day, all night

Live from the back block with the hard white, yeah
