[Verse 1]
I’m on my independent shit
I’m self-made what the fuck ya'll niggas help me with
You too pretty, you busy on that selfie shit
I run up on you when I beat you with the selfie stick
I’m too gritty, NY City; that guy, the bad guy
When y'all past the trap faster than a cab for a black guy
Yeah I’m a cheater but my affairs are black tie
Awwwwww life’s a bitch and I’m over treatin
Face in the pussy baby, I’m over eatin (yummm)
Over the stove leanin, til it’s over heatin (skrrt)
My gun German it sort of speakin in Puerto Rican (brrrat! brrrat!)
Mr. Marathon man (brrrat!)
Extended clip in the aerosol can
I ain’t have a full deck, plus I had the wrong hand
And I’m dirty but now I can take Macklemore fans, what you say…

[Hook]
Awwwww, lord of mercy
Lord of mercy
Hope the devil don’t curse me
For cutting up that work surgery
They testifyin' perjury
Oh they believe me now
I hope they believe me now
I hope they believe me now
They didn’t believe me then
But I hope they believe me now
Niggas know what I be about, heyyyyyy
Aww that’s me
Work in the pot
Aww that’s me
Start from the bottom
Aww that’s me
Work to the top
Aww that’s me
Look at that bitch
Aww that’s me
Blood sweat and tears
Aww that’s me
Real nigga
Aww that’s me
Trill!!!!
Yall know what I be about, Ayyyyyyy

[Verse 2]
It’s all bout the bread and the butter
I got one leg in the office a leg in the gutter
Niggas a kill you over a woman instead of your brother
You rather make it big homie probably instead of your mother
That’s real shit
I’m a young OG
I’m from where niggas sell drugs to the kids
Till your son OD
Its fucked up round here boy
Its frustration is (?) Satan
A teacher, I test niggas plus grade it
Drug weighing, gun spraying
You beatin' me is like translating what Young Thug saying
Someone saying I wouldn’t it make it, is just hatin (stop)
It’s one way in, I run way in
I’m high fashion so I take the runway in
I’m God holla at me when you done praying say Amen

[Hook]
Awwwww, lord of mercy
Lord of mercy
Hope the devil don’t curse me
For cutting up that work surgery
They testifyin' perjury
Oh they believe me now
I hope they believe me now
I hope they believe me now
They didn’t believe me then
But I hope they believe me now
Niggas know what I be about, heyyyyyy
Aww that’s me
Work in the pot
Aww that’s me
Start from the bottom
Aww that’s me
Work to the top
Aww that’s me
Look at that bitch
Aww that’s me
Blood sweat and tears
Aww that’s me
Real nigga
Aww that’s me
Trill!!!!
Yall know what I be about, Ayyyyyyy
