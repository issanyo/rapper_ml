[Verse 1]
Back on my bullshit
Gives a fuck about none niggas
Automatic with that head trigger
Diamonds looking like clear liquor
If you squad then I share with you
Played it hard on that ball scale
Cloud down i’m god baby
Your prayers all in my voicemail
Keep praying to God that that boy fail
Boy don’t let me remind these niggas
I got jumped in my dream
I went back to sleep just to find these niggas
I rock these niggas I roll with
Same old nigga that I smoke with
Money can’t turn me to a monster
Nah my nigga being broke did
How bout living with the roaches
From the bottom what you call it
From the bottom of the toilet
Dump the product in a bunch of water then you boil it
Dis here Queens nigga everything real
Nothing here made believe
I gave yo bitch some bread to go and paint her nails
And get the hair that will make her weave
Push her legs back till it break her knees
When she with you she can’t wait to leave
I called up a uber then she hate to leave
And then she start deep throating like she hate to breathe
Then I say stay stay baby stay
Ima just apply the pressure
If I ever get to make a rapper run
Ima find a diamond tester heffer

[Verse 2]
We be them niggas we be the squad
Bitch who you with Bitch who you with
We be the squad we be the clique
We too legit we be the squad
Lady stealer fresh out the Mercedes dealer
Body big like a eighteen wheeler
Dressed like a nineteen eighty’s dealer
The G’s that raised me made the eighty’s realer
The ladies say hey he’s realer
He’s trained like a Navy sealer
Andre Tequila
I was raised by crazy Killer
I was made by straight E-realers
Ain’t I
Straight up, I be that nigga I be that nigga
I be tha god, looked at yo wife
I would like a massage
She looked like my garage I pulled up in it
We be them niggas, we be them G’s
We be the squad opened my zipper
Then pray to god
