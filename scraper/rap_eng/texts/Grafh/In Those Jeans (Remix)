[Grafh Verse 1]
Got damn
Look at the way that you wearing them jeans
I wanna get lost somewhere in them jeans
And grind my way around
I wanna get lost and find my way around
And hit that spot
In your coke bottle shape
I hope I make the bottle break
And make your soda spill while your body shake
And bubble up, I'mma fuck the love
It's GANGSTA!
The way I like
That make a nigga wanna taste the bite
The way your waiste look right
I'll hit it from the back so long
That I forget what your face look like

But uh..I'll show you what a henny straight look like
And uh..Wanna get between them seems
So make a little more room for me in those jeans

And when I'm pulling your hair

And make your love come down, multiply (wha)
