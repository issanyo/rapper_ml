[Verse One: Grafh]
It's Black Hand, they not like we are
Some call me Grafh, some call me G-R
Some call him Prinz, some call him P-R
New York is dead, this is CPR
I took the Statue of Liberty out the ER
That's why they talk about me, pa!
I heard 'em say he work hard, I heard he work odd
I heard, he made a murder charge go turn a fraud
I heard, his car don't turn to start, he inserts a card
I heard he, work hard in the therapy on the curve
On the curve he, yes, indeedy! I'm the BEST of 'Pac
I'm the BEST of Biggie, dress extra spiffy
I need a elbow room, I need a extra city
My bankroll bigger than the vest on 50
Like, "Holla back, cutie"
And nobody hoooes worship me
Should I know God gotta have groupies
YEAAAAAAAAAH!!

[Chorus]
When we come around, shut the block down
No we never back down no how, no way
We get big money, large money, tall money, all moneeeeyyyyyyyy!!!!
What more can I say, we gettin money like
OHH OHH OHH, OHH OHH OHH OHH OHH
OHH OHH OHH, OHH OHH OHH OHH OHH (We spendin money like!!!!)
OHH OHH OHH, OHH OHH OHH OHH OHH
OHH OHH OHH, OHH OHH OHH OHH OHH
(We gettin money, money, money!!!)

[Verse Two: Busta Rhymes]
Look, PARA-medics come chalk out the dummy
Dem likkle funny niggas try and touch my BLOODCLAAT money
When I'm grindin, niggas might see me as dressed a lil' bummy
Got a bag of rubberbands that wrap money like I'm wrappin mummies
(YEAH!!) Let's Google a new word for wealth in the computer
I'm friends with the guy that designs the way money looks in the future
Then I dispose of niggas in a trash bags full of losers
You think ya money big nigga, then my money's SUPER DUPER
While I'm on probation my peeps carry the rueger
Then I laugh and stash cash in pretty places like Aruba
Then I dive for deep sea treasures and take lessons of scuba
There's more money nigga step to the rear
I'm Grand Puba on arrival, your highest title, numero uno
When I stuff money in all my pockets I look bigger than sumo
Wrestlers so go freshen up, I got a towel for ya
AKA the kid, Bus Rhymes Banco Popular
MONEY!!!!!!!!!!

[Chorus]
When we come around, shut the block down
No we never back down no how, no way
We get big money, large money, tall money, all moneeeeyyyyyyyy!!!!
What more can I say, we gettin money like
OHH OHH OHH, OHH OHH OHH OHH OHH
OHH OHH OHH, OHH OHH OHH OHH OHH (We spendin money like!!!!)
OHH OHH OHH, OHH OHH OHH OHH OHH
OHH OHH OHH, OHH OHH OHH OHH OHH
(We gettin money, money, money!!!)

[Verse Three: Prinz]
Queens! That's where the team's form
Count money so long it got a green thumb
And my hundred shot cali got a mean drum
I rock cases of that stuff and I don't mean rum
I get alot of bread, you ain't gotta wonder
I don't make it rain, I make it thunder
After the thunder then comes the monsoon
This is real life homey not a cartoon
This is Black Hand, we run alot of blocks
I done stuffed a hundred grand in a Prada box
Trust me homey you don't wanna start this
And it's real look like Mean Marcus
It's the Prinz, I'm the one they stealin fam
Stack money from the floor to the ceilin fan
When it comes to birds, I flew alot of those
That's why the bank accounts is like a box of Cheerios

[Chorus]
When we come around, shut the block down
No we never back down no how, no way
We get big money, large money, tall money, all moneeeeyyyyyyyy!!!!
What more can I say, we gettin money like
OHH OHH OHH, OHH OHH OHH OHH OHH
OHH OHH OHH, OHH OHH OHH OHH OHH (We spendin money like!!!!)
OHH OHH OHH, OHH OHH OHH OHH OHH
OHH OHH OHH, OHH OHH OHH OHH OHH
(We gettin money, money, money!!!)
