[Hook: Djhani]
Why don't you hug me?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you hold me?
My heart break!
Why do you hate me
Why don't you need me, empty and lonely
My heart break, you make my heart break!
You make my heart break, you make my heart break
You make my heart break, you make my heart break!

[Verse 1: Grafh]
Tell me how you're doing, tell me what's wrong
Tell me why you're hurt, tell me why you're so [?]
Did your heart break, tell me did it ever
Somebody did you dirty, hope I [?] do it better!
We argue all the time like I wanna lose you
I don't show emotion you say that I confuse you
Say that when I'm mad that I'm verbally abuse you
But I just wanna make you feel beautiful!
Maybe I never show it, I never, ever say it
Feel hard love, so we ain't communicating
You say that when you're talking you feel that you're [?]
The way you talk [?] complaining
Please, I ain't try to hear what you're saying
I ain't provide the umbrella when it's raining
I didn't not stop your heart from breaking
[?] you feel unappreciated!
Damn!

[Hook: Djhani]
Why don't you hug me?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you hold me?
My heart break!
Why do you hate me
Why don't you need me, empty and lonely
My heart break, you make my heart break!
You make my heart break, you make my heart break
You make my heart break, you make my heart break!

[Verse 2: Grafh]
Tell me that I'm inconsiderate
Tell me that I just don't give a shit
My attitude brought you down, damn it!
I guess I took you for granted a little bit
When I don't appreciate you, you think I'm crazy
You say I don't treat you like a lady
You that we argue, you say I never listen
Tell me how you feel but I don't pay attention!
You say you don't trust me, I say you don't have to
Every time you call me, you say I never answer
You say I ain't a gentlemen, I ain't no romancer
[?] ain't no chance!

[Hook: Djhani]
Why don't you hug me?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you hold me?
My heart break!
Why do you hate me
Why don't you need me, empty and lonely
My heart break, you make my heart break!
You make my heart break, you make my heart break
You make my heart break, you make my heart break!

[Verse 3: Grafh]
[?] where the flames go, bitch [?]
Wanna know a secret, I love it when you talk that
I love it when you talk that, I love your little attitude
Never ever fall back
Go on curse me, I don't know that
I love all your emotions, give me more [?]
You're calling me and I miss it? I'm a call back!
I'm a love you better, love me better too
I'm a uplift you, I'm a cherish you!
I'm a do the little thing you say I never do
[?] every time next to you!
I'm a pay more attention, just [?]
Remember, love is a two way street baby!

[Hook: Djhani]
Why don't you hug me?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you hold me?
My heart break!
Why do you hate me
Why don't you need me, empty and lonely
My heart break, you make my heart break!
You make my heart break, you make my heart break
You make my heart break, you make my heart break!
