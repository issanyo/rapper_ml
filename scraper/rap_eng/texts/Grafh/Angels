[Verse 1]
Ahem, when I was young dad was a player
Mom never nagged him
Daddy got caught
Then mom tried to stab him
Mommy got pregnant by accident
But he ain’t wanna have kids
He wanted to have some tits
I did Math and shit
I understand that him sticking around wasn’t happening
It was an accident
A by-product of passion that wasn’t passionate
Another bastard stuffed in a bastard net
But I was in a band that was stranded on the steps
Saw a boy that get touched by the hands of death
I hopped out the womb, born in the fire
Up goes the phoenix, born a survivor
Mom ain’t raised no fool, I’m a rider
I cut the umbilical cord with pliers
Destined for greatness that the Lord desired
I got the heart of a lion and a ball of fire
Boy, boy

[Hook]
Hey heaven shine a light on me
Hey God got his eye on me
Hey I done walk through the fire
You’re looking at a champion
Hey heaven shine a light on me
Hey God got his eye on me
Hey I done walk through the fire
You’re looking at a champion
May the angels walk with me
Looking at a champion
May the angels walk with me
May the angels walk with me
May the angels walk with me
May the angels walk with me
Looking at a champion

[Verse 2]
They say make your bed and lie in it
But I don’t know who made this bed but I’m in it
So I’m a spread that spread and iron it
As I declared the wrong mind till I die in it
I am it and I could explain my actions
But I can’t explain why anger became my passion
I feel pain, you imagine
But I was raised by a good woman
So I display compassion
That would explain why I give my last my slice
That’s why I’m willing to share my last bite
That’s why I shoot the fear instead of [?]
That’s why I judge a man by his last fight
And that’s why I still respect my father
Cause what you do today you might regret tomorrow
We both got pride that we never ever swallow
But my heart is pure and my breath is honor, amen

[Hook]
Hey heaven shine a light on me
Hey God got his eye on me
Hey I done walk through the fire
You’re looking at a champion
Hey heaven shine a light on me
Hey God got his eye on me
Hey I done walk through the fire
You’re looking at a champion
May the angels walk with me
Looking at a champion
May the angels walk with me
May the angels walk with me
May the angels walk with me
May the angels walk with me
Looking at a champion

[Verse 3]
I was born to be the best
Born to be alive
Born to rise at whatever storm arrives
Born to walk through the water
Shake it off and dry
Born to fly cross the darkest skies
Off the carpet high
I was born to try
I was born to live before I was born to die
I was born to sin
I was born to sneak
I was born to win so I was born to cheat
It’s all war and peace
I infrared dot my I’s and I double cross my T’s
I stand, I never run off and leave
And I go from raising the family to war and beef
Cause I’d die for whatever cause if I believe
I walk through the fire, under water I’m a breathe
I was born to score so of course I achieve
I was born a mortal on the cross
So of course I’m a bleed I’m the one

[Outro]
Ahem, hail Mary, full of grace
Hail Mary, full of grace
Our Father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Hail Mary, full of grace
Hail Mary, full of grace
Our Father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
