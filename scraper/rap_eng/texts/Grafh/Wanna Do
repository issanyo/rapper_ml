I serve it right now I don’t wait for no waiter
I eat it right now I don’t save it for later
That medicine I'm baking that president
You fake and irrelevant
The weight that I weigh got the weight of an elephant
I make it look eloquent with no table etiquette
I'm making the elements and I'm heading straight to your residence
Tell the [?] I'm breaking your evidence
