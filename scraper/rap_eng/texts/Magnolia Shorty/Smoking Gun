[Intro: Magnolia Shorty]
Come on, come on
Come on, come on

Let's go, let's go, let's go

[Hook: Jasmine Sullivan & Magnolia Shorty]
You’re the only one I love
The only man I know that I can trust
And if I ever should need you
I know you'd come
Ready to kill with a smoking gun
You’re the only one I love
The only man I know that I can trust
And if I ever should need you
I know you'd come
Ready to kill with a smoking gun

[Verse 1: Magnolia Shorty]
You want to fuck me in the car put this bitch in park
Take ya dick out and ram it in my private part
Boy you so hood, with a big ol' wood
Fuck me like you should, make it sound so good
You can have it way you want in the backseat or the trunk
I don't give a fuck, long as I'm drunk
Full of that grey goose cause it make me get loose
Ride that dick so good head off for something new
Put this pussy on you cause I know you like that boy
You just went home then you come right back boy
I got that jump-back, boy, I got that comeback boy
And that's why we in the car on this fuckin' dashboard in the new 500

[Jasmine Sullivan:]
You’re the only one I love
The only man I know that I can trust
And if I ever should need you

Ready to kill with a smoking gun
You’re the only one I love
The only man I know that I can trust
And if I ever should need you
I know you'd come
Ready to kill with a smoking gun
