[Intro]
Run that shit

[Hook]
1995, we used to ride that stick
Now it's 1996, ya gotta monkey on that dick
So monkey on that dick, monkey on that dick
Ooh, ooh!
Monkey on that dick, monkey on that dick
Ooh, ooh!
Monkey on that dick, monkey on that dick
Ooh, ooh!
Monkey on that dick, monkey on that dick
Ooh, ooh!
Monkey on that dick, monkey on that dick
Ooh, ooh!
Monkey on that dick, monkey on that dick
Ooh, ooh!
Monkey on that dick, monkey on that dick
Ooh, ooh!
Monkey on that dick, monkey on that dick

[Verse]
Now check it, it's just me, I'm Magnolia
But like I said a dude that's fucking off, he on that dick just like a soldier
Read the post, rude thugs, It's 1996
'Cus back in 1995 we used to ride them sticks
Like I said before time, they don't flip
