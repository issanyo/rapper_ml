[Spoken Word]
Live from on top of the Magnolia. It's Shorty, you dig?
How you figure that your team can affect my cream?
How you figure that your bitches could fuck with my riches?
You heard me? I'm 'bout the ends, fuck the fame, fuck the power, fuck the fake-ass friends
We gon' do it like this, from the 96 to the 97 era, with the fucking Cash Money Records, you heard me?
Taking over one state at a time, one rhyme after one rhyme
As we proceed to give you bitches what you need
