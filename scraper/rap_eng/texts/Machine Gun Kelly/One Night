[INTRO]
Ladies and Gentlemen
Welcome to the Greatest Show on Earth
It is not a dream or reality
It is only known as...
HOMECOMING

And I'm back, like that, yeah, yeah

[VERSE 1]
Blinded by the glare of the green lights, in the street nights
In my eyes now, balling with my top down, roof off, no closed box now
I can hear it in the air like when I stop sound
People looking like I must be lost, if I can't keep a job then I must be boss
And the hustle never dies, so there's no day off
And they be lookin' at the benefits, like "what that cost?"
Uh-uh, too much for you dawg
Couldn't buy this with the weight that U-Haul
Say you can't stand me, so you fall
??? And it's thanks to ya'll (Thanks!)
Cause now I'm in a different league
Was last, now first in a different scene
Ain't no thug in the kid, I'm a different breed
No couches, just penthouses, this me
And I'm free so the sky's no limit
I don't know restriction, all I know is infinite
Working round the clock, I don't know no minutes
Ya'll temporary to the game, call ya'll tenants
Then think of ya'll american image & combine it with the graphic lyrics that I be spitting
Then take a ride through the city I'm representing
And see their reaction when they see my face on the upper ending
What I wouldn't do for this if I only had 24 to live
Probably take it to the verse, no beat, no chorus, or bridge
And spit it straight from the mouth of the kid, and that's real
I done paid the fee (what's that?)
Two whole cities prayed for me, so best believe when I get what I earned
You'll see those names both faced on the map, word

[Chorus 2X]
If you only had one night, one night, one night
To make your dreams come to life then just keep on fighting
And reap what's priceless, you want advice?
Then I said, take whatever your vice is
You only live once, we don't get no twices
Smoking, drinking, cars, dices
Do it till your body is lifeless

[VERSE 2]
I don't have no regrets
All I got is balls, brains, and a mic, in that sequence
Bad broad coming in the gown with sequence
Doing things to me you'll only do on the weekends
You gotta love this life
Mix the stage with the lime, gotta love that light
They gets on when you bump it, I just call that Sprite
But I'm fly till I die, like a soul plane flight
Yup, infamous, bets on the table all in for this
???
That's glamorous, no back in the ambulance
And no shots gonna cancel this, no blazing glory just cameras
Besides only two hours to go, might as well spend it all at a show
Only 20 dollars in my pocket, might as well buy some dro
And drink till I'm passed out on the flo'
Grab my hotel key, then I order up a penthouse suite
Room service, with a truck full of bottles and some food to eat
And girls strip like it's New Years Eve
Only 30 minutes till the Casket
But I ain't stopping, I'm partying till the last breath
Go hard like I know no half step
Not doing the right thing, I gotta go half-left
As life scenes surrounding me
People only in the room cause the loud for free
Only five minutes till ???
So I'll make love while falling off the balcony

[Chorus 2X]
If you only had one night, one night, one night
To make your dreams come to life then just keep on fighting
And reap what's priceless, you want advice?
Then I said, take whatever your vice is
You only live once, we don't get no twices
Smoking, drinking, cars, dices
Do it till your body is lifeless
