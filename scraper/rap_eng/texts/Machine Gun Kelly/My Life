[Verse One: Machine Gun Kelly]
Got out of bed with my shoes on, can't remember last night
Press play, put my tunes on, now I'm feeling alright
Got a text from my girlfriend, said she tired of my shit
Then got another from my ex saying you shouldn't have left me for that bitch
Love sucks like the women in my life though
A couple words and it's over like a haiku
But fuck it, three hoes and an apple makes a pipe
Let's get higher than we did back in high school
Cause to the world, I'm just a psycho, tattoo dropout
What do I know? So I just cope, smoking hydro
Walking down the streets, kicking pinecones, my zone

[Hook: Alex Fitts]
I don't need you to worry for me cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore cause it's my life
Go ahead with your own life and leave me alone

[Verse Two: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yesterday I told the boss that I quit, got home and my family flipped
Spent my last paycheck on a chair, that's a comfortable seat
Cause I'm 100 percent comfortable not doing shit
Watching movies all night like an insomniac
All my haters trying to figure where the parties at
Wish I had enough munchies to cause a heart attack
But all I got's a dollar and a bottle cap, roger that
City slickers smoking wood boy, knowing delight cause I'm good in my hood boy
And everybody know I'm so Cleveland, it's a god damn shame
Wouldn't change it if I could boy so if they wonder where my manners at
Spinning with my dirty draws in the laundromat
Who cares if my prom night sucks? Get up off my nuts ugh
