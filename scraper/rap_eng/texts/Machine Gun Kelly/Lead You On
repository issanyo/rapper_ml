Twice I turned my back on you
I fell flat on my face but didn’t lose
Was it the blue light
Gone fragile?
Was it above the man?
In wonder, steady going under...

Tell them drain the pool I’m sinking fast
Come and save my life before it pass
Scratching at the surface but the bottom’s where I’m at
Only place my addiction will tell me that I’m free at last
So why the fuck you playing with my head? I said I’m done
Any and everything I had is gone I said you won
You promised that we’d only be together for a minute then we finish
But my life is passed another year why the fuck is you in it
Bitch I gave up everything for you even my house
Now I’m begging on a nightly basis to sleep on the couch
My counselor said I need to find a way to block the pain
I told him it was already too late she is in my veins and he said

[Yukimi Nagano]
Tell me what led you on, I’d love to know...

[Machine Gun Kelly]
Well, it’s just that, when I felt her the first time I flew
Nobody gives me the high that she do
See, we fight all the time and she leaves bruises on my arms
But the way she makes me feel inside that girl can do no wrong
Now all my family hates me since I started fuckin with her
And all my friends done left me cause they jealous that I’m wit her
I try to break it off but she gets me back with the feel
After everything she did why the fuck do I love that needle?
Please help me...

Look, this love’s killing me, literally
Every time I start to pick you up, you finish me
Used to love waking up in the mornings and feeling you
Now I’m just ashamed wearin long sleeves concealing you
Bitch you wasn't shit, how the fuck could you do this?
Now my fucking life is ruined, I’ma kill you bitch I’ll do it so I
Tie it up, stick that shit up in my skin and overdose on your love
So I can’t have it again
