[Intro: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
We are legion
This Tecca Nina in your arena
We saw no reason

[Chorus: Y2]
Yeah, start shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, our shit
For no reason, the hardest
For no reason, start shit
For no reason, mob shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, mosh pit

[Bridge: Y2]
I just think you fuckin' with the wrong one
Times like this I don't know how to have fun
I think I'ma fuck somebody up (Fuck 'em up)
You gon' need someone to hold you up
What the fuck

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
My city stand up
Stoppin' people that got animosity and what
Copyin' me, and the property poppy, ya jammed up
With akis the cam bust, don't mock me, the brand's us
Strange Music, the game shoot at right at the fakers
They came stupid with the claim you get took for you change and name usage
Steppin' to me, link with the lane and you losin' definitely
Ready for ruckus, really we reppin' the B (ah, ah)
This the eviction notice, missingly quick and go get
Hitters consider me and my niggas be sick and roguish
Stop you ain't ready to brawl, you can't hang
Lock hit you dead in the jaw, you claim Strange
It ain't K, to Kan City to jam with me
You damn sissy eat up a object to stands stiffly in my pants with me
Never honor who bringing drama to the Don if you continue
Now gonna do what I come to do, guess what I'ma do

[Chorus: Y2 & Machine Gun Kelly]
Start shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, our shit
For no reason, the hardest
For no reason, start shit
For no reason, mob shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, mosh pit
(Let's get to it)

[Bridge: Y2 & Machine Gun Kelly]
I just think you fuckin' with the wrong one (The wrong one tho!)
Times like this I don't know how to have fun (I don't know!)
I think I'ma fuck somebody up, fuck 'em up (Gunna)
You gon' need someone to hold you up (Hold you up, huh)
What the fuck

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
It's only one option, you gon' need a doctor
I ain't talkin' 'bout the one from Compton
Arms, feet, legs all gone like I'm Don Corleone
Hiring James Bond, that's what I'm on
Remain calm but aware that I'm armed and dangerous
See Double X is known to gang with us
So hang tight, I'm trying to get this right
You think 'cause I wrote a pop hit that I won't pop shit?
The fuck's wrong with you Pop-Tarts?
I pop cherries and popstars, you popsicles is not hard
Popped in on the top charts out the cop car
To remind y'all you just rap, you're not God
And I don't care who got bars
Because they don't acknowledge mine, show me who got scars
Show me the greatest on the stage and the arena
Bet they point they finger up at the Gunner and Tecca N9na

[Bridge: Y2]
I just think you fuckin' with the wrong one
Times like this I don't know how to have fun
I think I'ma fuck somebody up
You gon' need someone to hold you up
What the fuck

[Verse 3: Y2]
She will not leave a bunch of passes
I just wanna see that ass yeah
Caribou Lou in my glass yeah
I start a riot by accident
Somebody's bitch showin' ass again
I should start throwin' some cash again
Pushing the crowd, we harassin' them
If you start makin' me mad, I

[Chorus: Y2]
Start shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, our shit
For no reason, the hardest
For no reason, start shit
For no reason, mob shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, mosh pit

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
We are leaders
We saw a reason
