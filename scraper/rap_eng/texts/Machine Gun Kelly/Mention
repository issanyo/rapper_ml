[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly]
Sosa 808 made it
Aye, came up, shame us
Fuck you think?
Aye, pour me some
Day One music
Double X

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Aye
This shit ain't normal
'Cause where I'm from, it ain't formal (Nah)
Keep that drink, it tastes like caramel (What?!)
Reap what I sow, that shit karma (I know, I know)
Big sig Sauer
Product of my paranoia
Recent calls all from my lawyer
That's why I smoke on that sequoia
I need it, need it
Just to keep me higher than the drama
Away from the piranhas
Tryna get the commas
Go and get it then (Yeah, yeah)
Look, these are my ambitions as a motherfuckin' rider
Aye, never give a fuck
Never trust a young bit, not mention us
Never back down
How the fuck's the world yours? You can't run a town
Yeah I came up
And y'all watched, y'all know I ran through the blocks
Pen and paper, back in Shaker
I done came from up the way and made a page of my city

[Hook: Ripp Flamez & (Machine Gun Kelly)]
When they askin' 'bout who run the city
(Gunna)
You know who to mention
You know who is in it
Moving through the trenches
When they talkin' bout who got the city
They gon' bring my name up
They gon' say I came up
Who ain't turn a gang up?

[Verse 2: Ripp Flamez]
This shit ain't average
I'mma fuckin' rap and sing this savage
This that dope straight out the plastic
This that dope straight out the package
This that blue magic
Shit get tragic
Where I came from niggas died every time I came home
I'm just really tryna put my gang on
Niggas dyin' tryna put these chains on
Ever since they heard a nigga came on up
They wanna put these chains on us
They wanna put the blame on us
Still ridin' with the thang on us
I'm too wavy
And I know they all wanna know how
My Jack baby
Turned to the hottest nigga in my state
I love money
It's the hard work and it's all work no play
It's the hard work and it's all work no play

[Hook: Ripp Flamez]
When they askin' 'bout who run the city
You know who to mention
You know who is in it
Moving through the trenches
When they talkin' 'bout who got the city
They gon' bring my name up
They gon' say I came up
Who ain't turn a gang up?

[Outro: Ripp Flamez]
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
