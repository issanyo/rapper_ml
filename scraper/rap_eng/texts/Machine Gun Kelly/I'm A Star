"If you feel like I feel then you know that gravity only limit the star but so much and we took this to the top from the bottom"

[Verse 1]
Hold up
Back for the last time
That'll be the last time I'm saying it's the last time
And I'm serious this round
I'm holdin' myself down and I keep it poppin' off like land mine
Yeah, we to the sky like NASA
Send me in the stars so lets hit them with a mascot
Saying I'm speaking in tongues but I give em fast rhyme
Never plan on slowing down when you living the fast life
Because I'mma rip-rap star and I'm the mother mother made man
Out of the south of the bottom Mexican sand tan
And we a team so everybody throw your hands in
Who would of thought Hollywood was where we'd land in AMEN!

[Chorus]
Everybody know I'm that kid they wanna be me man
Gotta stay from them shades the grey
Make sure they see me man
I gotta keep on breathing man
I gotta keep succeeding man
Gotta put that city boy from Cleveland on the city map
Cause I'mma star now everybody in the world wants to know my name and
I'mma represent the city from which I came
So if you feel me throw your drinks in the air
We got them like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah cause I'mma star!

[Verse 2]
You can check my room MESS!
Symbolic tattoos Yes!
Number one on the ruthless
Live life without the move check
School days I failed test
Skinny boy check my frill chest
Even throughout my antics Kells' hell's best Hell Yes!
I'm on my roll to perdition
Baby you know the deal
Spill out a dragon out on the sidewalk keeping it tradition here
I'm calling all the shots so they call me the animator
The youngest hustler of the year, (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Everybody know I'm that kid they wanna be me man
Gotta stay from them shades the grey
Make sure they see me man
I gotta keep on breathing man
I gotta keep succeeding man
Gotta put that city boy from Cleveland on the city map
Cause I'mma star now everybody in the world wants to know my name and
I'mma represent the city from which I came
So if you feel me throw your drinks in the air
We got them like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah cause I'mma star!

[Verse 3]
We took it to the top from the bottom
I target it, I got'em
They said with my stardom, y'all would tear me down like Sodom
Competition, parted
See y'all in visitors parking
You paid for this event while I headline it like Marvin
Yawning, all of these rappers ain't rapping
They talking three quarters caught 'em just flapping their jaws in
Half of these rapping keeps talking about white
The slows right through my soul in
But I never through the gave all in
Hotter than a summer down in New Orleans
I'm the big bang in the second millennium
Somebody better go tell'em I'm the star
BLAHHHHH!

[Chorus]
Everybody know I'm that kid they wanna be me man
Gotta stay from them shades the grey
Make sure they see me man
I gotta keep on breathing man
I gotta keep succeeding man
Gotta put that city boy from Cleveland on the city map
Cause I'mma star now everybody in the world wants to know my name and
I'mma represent the city from which I came
So if you feel me throw your drinks in the air
We got them like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah cause I'mma star!
