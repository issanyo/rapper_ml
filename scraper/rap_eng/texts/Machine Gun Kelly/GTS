[Intro]
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Ayy

[Chorus]
I ain't taking calls, I be going through shit (going through shit)
I don't speak at all, I be going through shit
Don't say nothin' to me, I be going through shit (going through shit)
I've been through so much that what I took is not enough

[Verse 1]
Ay, here's a story, 'bout the time that I smoked
Everything in my inventory, for the glory
And the fact my past is gory, the boy met world like Cory (ay)
Real life, hit like Beckham, shitstorm looked like Maury
The boy lost like Dory, only one way that I'm performing (aye)
Pour it up, pour it up
Keep it coming, I need more of them
Pour it up, pour it up
Keep it coming 'til I'm throwing up
I don't even go in public, without feeling like I should be on a substance
I'm in my room like a recluse
Look what the fuck you people made me do?

[Chorus]
I ain't taking calls, I be going through shit (going through shit)
I don't speak at all, I be going through shit
Don't say nothin' to me, I be going through shit (going through shit)
I've been through so much that what I took is not enough

[Verse 2]
Okay, okay, wait, feel like Kevin Gates
Kick that ahh right in the face
Kick that shit like Johnny Cage
Stick this dick in your rib cage
Cleveland where the fuckin' rage
Spit that shit that make you rage
I did acid everyday
I ain't never been the same
Who the fuck, who the fuck stupid enough to think they can do something to us?
Tell me (who?)
Who the fuck, who the fuck, crazy enough to think they can light stadiums up like (you)
I just wanna know why every time I drop an album they be sleeping and I'm waking them up like (ooh)
Who the fuck, who fuck don't respect?
You better be paying it up (ooh)

[Chorus]
I ain't taking calls, I be going through shit (going through shit)
I don't speak at all, I be going through shit
Don't say nothin' to me, I be going through shit (going through shit)
I've been through so much that what I took is not enough
I ain't taking calls, I be going through shit (going through shit)
I don't speak at all, I be going through shit
Don't say nothin', to me I be going through shit (going through shit)
I've been through so much that what I took is not enough

[Outro]
Going through shit
Going through shit
