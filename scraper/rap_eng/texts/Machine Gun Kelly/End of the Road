[Hook: Matt Musto]
Yeah, it’s a long way home at the end of the road
I’ll be pavin my own way, to the top, I be here to stay
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it’s your last

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
All my life, I couldn’t fit in, like a bad shoe
I was always too square, too cube, too tall, too weird, too blue
Forget them high-school’s hotties now I’m too cool
I guess I came a long way from that young kid
The school’s most popular lame, no friends, no style, no clothes, no ends
Just a bed, fell asleep, never woke up again
Yeah, and my last prayer was don’t ever let me end up like the people that’s down here
Cause the one that fear change be the one that don’t care
Look at themselves and see somebody else in the mirror
But you can always pick me out of the crowd
Loud mouth with my very own style
And what I know now is don’t ever pretend
And live every single day like you won’t see it again

[Hook: Matt Musto and Machine Gun Kelly]
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it’s your last
And if you only have 24 hours, 1400 minutes before your dreams gone
Then you better go live it, cause whatever you love could be taken away
So live like it’s your dying day

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I dedicate this to my teachers that never believed in me
And the mother that conceived, but ended up leaving me
I just wish y'all could see me smile, this big’s grin on the tv now
And I took it from the bottom to the top
From the holes in my socks, Ramen noodles in the pot
Used to rob them on the block, now they stop me in the drop
Middle finger up and that ain’t gonna stop
I used to take orders, now I make bets
I used to scrub floors, now I sign checks
I used to push carts, now I push songs
I used to be there, now I am so gone
I fired myself, found a job myself
Established my name and then I signed myself
And what I tell myself, is you did this by yourself
And when I'm on so long, I’ll be by myself

[Hook: Matt Musto and Machine Gun Kelly]
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it’s the last
And if you only have 24 hours, 1400 minutes before your dreams gone
Then you better go live it, cause whatever you love could be taken away
So live like it’s your dying day

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
I wish I could see their faces when they heard your boy spit
Wish I could know what they’re thinking when they heard my first hit
Cause I remember them wishing that I wouldn’t get big
Now I bet they’re wishing they wouldn't of said that shit
I came out of a dying city brought back life
Everything they said I couldn’t do I did about twice
Multiplied by the bottles that we popped each night
That equals out to a celebration, bitches more ice
Make it toast to the underdogs, toast to the team
Toast to the fact we this close to the dream
Pour one for my exes, used to talk reckless
But now I push Benzes and rock Rolexes
Came from the city and until they come and get me
Turn around and see the whole east side’s still with me
And that’s how we live it, you mans don’t change
Look, it's still the kid, still can’t tell me a goddamn thing

[Hook: Matt Musto and Machine Gun Kelly]
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it’s the last
And if you only have 24 hours, 1400 minutes before your dreams gone
Then you better go live it, cause whatever you love could be taken away
So live like it’s a dying day

[Hook: Matt Musto]
Yeah, it’s a long way home at the end of the road
I’ll be pavin my own way, to the top, I be here to stay
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it’s your last
