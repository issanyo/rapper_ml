Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby
Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby

[Verse 1]
I'm just out here chasing my dreams, girl
But it's crazy cause that dream cost me my Dream Girl
Promised you I wouldn't change before I left
Now I think leaving is the one thing I regret
Cause the one thing I possess
It wasn't materials, wasn't checks, wasn't cars, wasn't clothes, or any part of success
It was you, and without that in my life I'm depressed
You became the new drug I couldn't get
And every time you came over I was on some shit
Either too fucked up, or bitching about how you dress
Even though I remember when you would lay with me when I ain't have a bed
Buy me food and come wake me up with some head
You had me like a dread - locked down, but I wouldn't show it
Instead got on that bus and left you blowing in the wind
Shit, and it's fucked up cause every girl I'm with I see your face
Now summers here and I'm sitting outside your place singing this shit

[Hook]
Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby
Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby

[Verse 2]
I never thought for a minute if you showed me a picture of my life now, that you wouldn't be in it
Took me a couple years to say I loved you, but I meant it when I said it
Wasn't much of a romantic, but you get it
Didn't really smoke, but when I rolled it up, you hit it
And we lit it up - shotgunning our kisses
And fuck these other bitches, baby, fuck these other bitches in my bunk
Staring up at all your pictures that you sent me on my birthday
Remember that? Cause I couldn't forget it
Like I forgot yours, but I'm sorry and I said it
I admit it, I fucked up and I lied, but this is true
I don't know what home is because I'm lost without you
Just like our favorite song, yeah - Blink 182
Now I just turn it off when it comes on, I wish I hated you
I used to have someone at 3am that I could call
Now it just rings and I don't get nothing at all
Where you at girl?

[Interlude]
*Phone Rings*
Come on pick up!
Yeah hold on give me a minute
"Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system"
(Hi, uhm, I'm not here right now
Please leave a message)
*Beep*
Damn...

[Hook]
Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby
Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby
