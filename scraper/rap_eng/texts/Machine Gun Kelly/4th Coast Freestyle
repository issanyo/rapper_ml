[Intro]
Ay dolph I had to borrow this beat
My city need me real quick

[Verse 1]
My bitches say I'm nasty than a mothafucka
I hit the jace thraxy than a mothafucka
Vintage frames classic than a mothafucka
Backseat of the uber ashin' like a mothafucka
I be high as Snoop, sippin' gin and juice
Get me drunk I'll stomp yo ass out in these diesel boots
Industry tryin' to change me, but I can't do that
My city miss me so I booked a jet and flew back
Ay fuck yo questions what you askin' bout this mothafucka
It ain't no talkin' it's just action out this mothafucka
Talk bout Cleveland then we taxin' out this mothafucka
We get them Benjamins and Jacksons out that mothafucka
I went from one bedroom apartments to a mansion (whoa there)
I fuck my bitch and we listen to Marilyn Manson (I go there)
They be tryin' figure out how I get all the grams
I say the plug is my mothafuckin' biggest fan
Blow some smoke up in the air, let them know we here
Let me make it clear, don't you ever mothafuckin' dare
Disrespect the youngest bosses up in here, this is not a game
I am just a player, I see all this tryin' take up my career
I need inspiration, I look in the mirror
Pablo Escobar with the yay, I don't sell it I just let'em play
I don't tell'em, they just know what's up
Clean the whole plate, let me fuck
Hit the range on a Sunday, I'm like Rambo with the K
Put some pictures of my haters up
Load them rounds up, let them spray
That's some fucked up shit to say
Oh well, I'm fucked up anyway
Hugh Hefner suite at the Palms
Black suits like it's wedding day
We don't wife shit, we just pipe shit
EST dawg that's for life shit
I'm a livin' legend fuck the hype shit
I'm a livin' legend fuck the hype shit
I'm on my shit call a flight to the grammys
Like give me what you owe me
Lookin' like Cavaliers at the finals
I'm about to get the fuckin' trophy
Ride around the land with my top down
Standin' on the bridge this is my town
4th coast midwest represent (rep, rep)
We don't talk about it, we just rep the shit
Ride around the land with my top down
Standin' on the bridge this is my town
4th coast midwest represent (rep, rep)
We don't talk about it, we just rep the shit

[Outro]
(I'm back bitch, Ay!)
