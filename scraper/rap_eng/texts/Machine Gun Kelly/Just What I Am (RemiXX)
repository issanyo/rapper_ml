[Intro]
9:56 am
Roll the windows down
Let the smoke out, aye
Wake and bake, bitch

[Verse]
Aye, I'm just what you made god
I been high as fuck
Since me and my homeboy A-Rod
Was in Tower City, tryna catch that bus
We out here, what you need?
Back in Shaker, baggin' tree
Baby mama call from the college
Said them kids wanna pay the fee
I'm up early in the morning
Smoke in public, my trap is jumpin'
I made two hundred, that count for somethin'
I pull up get them Lil Debbie muffins
I'm out here, on my daughter
Whiskey, weed, and water
Just beat that misdemeanor last week
Need new money for the lawyer
I need new carpet at the crib
God damn this roach is where I live
So dope, put some groceries in the fridge
Young man, just hope that God forgives
Fast forward, old hoes knockin' on my door
Askin' where do I be at now
Smokin' loud on my tour bus
Famous bitch in my back lounge
I done blew up past rap now
And it feel good, bitch I'm from the hood
So I lived a life I that I should you, hoe
Get the shit understood you, hoe
Came in this shit as a kid, you know
I ain't Cudi, but that's the buddy
We in Coach party, talkin' Cobain
Smokin' hella Js, out in London
No beef at 16, I've known Chip since 16
Call Ben Baller, told him we need custom
Diamond Cleveland championship rings
We need all of them big things
Just 'cause we deserve it
Just 'cause the ones who fucked me over
All need to see if it was worth it
Damn, old homies switched up on me
Why am I not surprised
Lookin' at me like I need to share the piece
When they weren't even there to make the pie
Man that's why
Yeah, yeah
Fake friends fuck them, right though
Ay fuck a fake friend, get high
And talk to god dawg mutha fucka

[Hook]
Let me tell yall about my month yall
Codeine in my blunts yall
Like why the fuck did I smoke the shit?
Fell asleep and never woke up from it
But whatever, that man ain't wearin' my denim pants
And these long, long nights on all this cocaine
Ain't workin man

[Verse 2]
So, what am I to do when the game is so fake and I am true
And my city just got the W
And the number one spot is vacant too
And I think my foot might fit the shoe
And I think my glasses look a fool
And I know my daughter so proud
Tellin' kids my daddy got a pool
And I can't stop smilin' at the crib
I can't stop frownin' out in public
I got this paparazzi on me
I see these rappers actin' funny
I see them stealin' what I did
I see them pimpin' out the culture
I heard the game missed the kid
Dear hip-hop this what I wrote y'all
Just what I am

[Outro]
Young kells in this muthafucka
Young gun in this muthafucka blam, aye
For my city though, for the game
EST
That is me, huh
Hold up that is we, aye
Double X, aye
We the best, aye
The Boulevard going crazy though
Red lights muthafucka, white smoke, haha
