(Hook x2)
Me and my dawg, represent like what (rep, rep)
Represent like what (like what, like what)
Me and my bitch get it in like what
We get it in like what uh

(Bridge)
And if ya nevar had a penny, don't ya wanna ball?
Used to fall asleep wit the stomach empty, now don't ya wanna ball?
Tattoos like Machiavelli, the shit that make ya wanna ball
And I'mma die when I'm ready, but I'm livin' so I want it all

(Verse)
Me and my dogs getting blow beatch
My lil brother just got out of parole beatch
My daughter just turned five years old beatch
And we ain't mopping no mo floors beatch
None of my brothers work 9 5
Neva scared living life, we got nine lives
Keep it hood with the hen on my tie
Smoking on la-la, bumpin' Big Poppa
I mean look at all the shit we been thru
Seven people in a four door rental
I mean look at what we did with a pencil!
Beat a statistic of becomin' anotha stencil
I mean an outline on that sidewalk
Man, I'm supposed to be dead and that's real talk

(Hook x2)
Me and my dawg, represent like what (rep, rep)
Represent like what (like what, like what)
Me and my bitch get it in like what
We get it in like what uh

(Bridge)
And if ya neva had a penny, don't ya wanna ball?
Used to fall asleep wit the stomach empty, now don't ya wanna ball?
Tattoos like Machiavelli, the shit that make ya wanna ball
And I'mma die when I'm ready, but I'm livin' so I want it all

(Verse 2)
I wonder what ya got for a little muthafucka
A real muthafucka, chill muthafucka
[Lyrics from: http://www.lyrics.az/machine-gun-kelly/{album._path_title}/wanna-ball.html]
I guess it's God's will
Yet and still, I'm in the field with dolla bills
To track sharks with no gills, ready to kill muthafucka
And I don't want no part of that, the first time I heard kat-kat-kat
I almost had a fuckin' heart attack
Stuttering like that-that-that shit was crazy
Maybe it's time I used the talent that God gave me
But I was just local
Didn't have a rap name, I was just hopeful
Paid for my first studio session with quarters
We didn't even have enough money to cut vocals, damn
Traded pop cans for dimes
Sum' wanna be doctors, I wanted to rhyme
And if followin' yo dreams to crime, then I'mma crook
Guess I'll be in the book, when they get me, in due time

(Interlude)
Free all my real muthafuckas!
We livin bitch! Fuck da police!

(Hook x2)
Me and my dawg, represent like what (rep, rep)
Represent like what (like what, like what)
Me and my bitch get it in like what
We get it in like what uh

(Bridge)
And if ya neva had a penny, don't ya wanna ball?
Used to fall asleep wit the stomach empty, now don't ya wanna ball?
Tattoos like Machiavelli, the shit that make ya wanna ball
And I'mma die when I'm ready, but I'm livin' so I want it all

(Outro)
Yeah! Can ya believe?
Yo boy is living the muthafuckin dream
While they still sleep
Ha, sons-of-bitches
Alarm clock ain't going off till the work days half-way over
Fuck it! Light five more
And I heard home-boy done fucked erry bitch on the block, hahahaha
That muthafuckin' crazy
Cleveland, Cleveland, Cleveland, Cleveland
Cleveland, Cleveland, Cleveland, Cleveland
