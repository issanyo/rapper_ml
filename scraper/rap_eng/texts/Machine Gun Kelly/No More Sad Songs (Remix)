[Verse 1: Perrie]
I keep trying, nothing's working
I still wanna know, if you're alone
I keep trying to put this behind me
I still wanna know who's taking you home

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne]
For tonight, I'm going to get my mind off it
Don't care that someone's got his hands all over my body
Stay out all night, go where the music is loud
So I don't have to think about it, I'm beggin', please, don't play

[Chorus: Leigh-Anne + Jade & (Jesy + Jade)]
No more! (Sad songs)
No more! (Sad songs)
No more! (Sad songs)
I'm beggin', please, don't play
No more! (Sad songs)
No more! (Sad songs)
No more! (Sad songs)
I'm beggin', please, don't play, no more sad songs

[Verse 2: Jesy]
Dancing with danger, talking to strangers
Don't care where I go, just can't be alone
They'll never know me, like you used to know me, no

[Pre-Chorus: Jade]
For tonight, I'm going to get my mind off it
Don't care that someone's got his hands all over my body
Stay out all night, go where the music is loud
So I don't have to think about it, I'm beggin', please, don't play

[Chorus: Jade + Leigh-Anne & (Jesy + Jade)]
No more! (Sad songs)
No more! (Sad songs)
No more! (Sad songs)
I'm beggin', please, don't play
No more! (Sad songs)
No more! (Sad songs)
No more! (Sad songs)
I'm beggin', please, don't play

[Post-Chorus: Leigh-Anne & (Jade)]
No more sad songs (No, no more sad songs)
No more sad songs
No more sad songs (No, no more sad songs)
No more sad songs (Oh)

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
Taste
Of the good life. Can you keep pace?
Can you ride shotgun in the fast lane
With your eyes wide shut, tell me do you have faith in me
Stay
The whole night 'til you feel the sun rays
Can you forget everything your man sayin'
And let all of our pain be the champagne?

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly & Perrie]
Let me take the wheel from here
And penthouse suite chill from here
Show you the realest years
Stare at the skies with you
Only got eyes for you
Even when the light's off, I'm visualising you
I see your wonder wall, I get close to you
I watch you let it fall, and get emotional
Erasing past, we are free at last
I'm beggin', please, don't play

[Chorus: Perrie & Leigh-Anne + Jade & (Jesy + Jade)]
No more! (Sad songs)
No more! (Sad songs)
No more! (Sad songs)
I'm beggin', please, don't play
No more! (Sad songs)
No more! (Sad songs)
No more! (Sad songs)
I'm beggin', please, don't play

[Post-Chorus: Jade & Leigh-Anne]
No more sad songs, no, no more sad songs
No more sad songs
No more sad songs, no, no more sad songs
No more sad songs, oh
No more sad songs
