[Hook 1: Anna Yvette]
All we have is right now
All we have is right now

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah, staring out into the unknown
Voices in the wind telling me to come home
But I'm scared
Scared that all this time I've been gone
I’ll open up the door and my little daughter will be grown
And I’m cold, tell me why I'm so cold?
Probably cause a shoulder turns every night that I’m on the road
Probably why I can’t smile every time that I’m on the phone
And why I'm acting so wild every time that I’m alone
Save me!
I suffocate myself beside the bed
Tryna cut the circulation of these thoughts inside my head, like
"Do I hate me? Or do I hate them?"
Either way I've held grudges since I was holding a pen
My father had me think that my cousin was dead
Just to hide me from the truth, how can I look at him again?
But this is life, and in life we learning to live
And when the past dies, this where it begins cause

All we have is right now (Go hard or go home)
All we have is right now (Go hard or go home)
All we have is right now (Go hard or go home)
All we have is right now (Go hard or go home)

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Question, what if tomorrow never comes?
And everything you said today couldn't be undone?
Cause all it takes is a bullet from one gun
To take another’s moment away from them, one love I know
See I was just an only child growing up
Just frowns cause I never seen a smile growing up
But you? You were a friend, always down growing up
Give the word, knew you would’ve blown trial growing up
Fuck! How could we let all this petty shit blind us?
How the fuck did we let the devil find us?
See, we were supposed to be best friends 'til the end, you promised
How’d it take that fucking night to remind us?
I only said I hated you cause you're the only one that’s ever honest
Man I said I was wrong, let’s get beyond this
But it’s crazy, cause I never thought my text apologising
Would be the reason that you died driving
Damn

All we have is right now (Go hard or go home)
All we have is right now (Go hard or go home)
All we have is right now (Go hard or go home)
All we have is right now (Go hard or go home)

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
Hey, and when the sky turns grey
What you gonna do when your blues still stay?
Tried living the dream, yeah, but you still wake
Anything is possible though, cause rules still break
Hey, said when the sky turns grey
What you gonna do when your blues still stay?
Anything is possible cause rules still break
So when your dream comes don’t wake, yeah
