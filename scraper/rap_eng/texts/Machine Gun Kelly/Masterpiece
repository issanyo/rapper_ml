[Intro: Gugu Mbatha-Raw]
Masterpiece (4x)

[Verse 1: Gugu Mbatha-Raw]
I got that bomb, I know what them boys want
When I put it on him right we be at it til dawn
Have your man's face to work, he luh the way I twerk
He luh the way I bust it, he luh the way I-- (yeah)
And now he's talking 'bout settle down meet his mom
Why settle now, here's your girl with the drama
He ballin' out on me, feels like I hit the number
Damn right I feel that bone cause I'm creeping undercover

[Hook: Gugu Mbatha-Raw]
He say I'm a masterpiece
Call me Master P
Cause there ain't no limiting
When I make that  body say
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby
You love it when I rock that thing
Feel like we in a dream
Float above life then fall back in the bed again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby

[Breakdown- Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Machine Gun Kelly)]
Do it (bust it)(12x)

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Girl you got what I want, come and get what you need
I tattoo triple x on my stomach, come and see what that means
I drop like 500 gs, treat you like the real Mona Lis'
I put that body on the wall, show you how to paint a masterpiece
Said she want a new whip with that top back
Ass fat so I cop that
Kill time with that dirty wine so I lock it down with no cop badge
Now work it, girl don't close them curtains
Let these people see, make it clap in repeat

[Hook: Gugu Mbatha-Raw]
He say I'm a masterpiece
Call me Master P
Cause there ain't no limiting
When I make that  body say
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby
You love it when I rock that thing
Feel like we in a dream
Float above life then fall back in the bed again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby

[Breakdown- Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Machine Gun Kelly)]
Do it (bust it)(12x)
