[Verse 1]
Almost, to the top
Almost famous, shit y'all know
Hesitation, don’t get none
Still I’ll go to the basement, put Vice City in the PlayStation
Get away from stress, keep Js rotatin'
Dab rings and a bad bitch naked, I just wanna live

[Interlude]
See that’s what the fuck I’m talkin' about right there
Yeah yeah, I just wanna live
Let me smoke my weed in public, eat this In-N-Out burger
Can I, live? Sleep in 'til mothafuckin' noon and fuck my bitch
You know what I’m saying?
That’s my perfect world right there

[Verse 2]
Back to it
What if I don’t wanna work?
For a boss I don’t get along with
Name tag on a shirt
I’d rather be at home doing bong rips
But I’m just being real
A lil' irresponsible but I don’t really give a fuck how you feel
'Cause this ain’t your life
This is all my shit, my shit
Don’t worry about where I’m at, who I’m wit'
Commenting on the words that come from my lips
Bitch, please excuse my wrist
While I whip, whip, whip, whip
The car they said I couldn’t get
With the all black leather on, looking like the Matrix
I am the one light 2 joints, 35 millimeter life viewpoint
Everything is like a movie nowadays
Speaking of I did a movie the other day, ay!
I just, I just, I just wanna know am I being modest?
Asking 50k a show, or do I need mo’?
For all of the years it was slow
For every show where no one would’ve showed
For driving 12 hours to perform in the cold
Getting to the do’ and being told no
Bitch I want all that back times ten
Say it again, bitch I want all that back times ten
Bitch, I want all that back times ten
One more ‘gain, bitch I want all that back times ten
So, pay up!
