[VERSE 1]
My name is Kid Kells
??? around my neck I rock jew-els
??? cause my shit sells
I'm another plateau, level so high I see an-gels, farewell
That's why I walk it like I talk it, and I ain't saying nothing
So I guess that I ain't walking, I'm rolling in that 300
See I ain't no G, but best believe that I run it
I'll talk shit, I'm a hustler, talk money
Bank rolls, stash spots, shoulda, coulda, woulda, them have nots
Pants swole up from them cash knots and my roof lift back like laptops
Who is you kidding, y'all ain't living y'all are scraping
And as long as money talk, I can't hear none of y'all hating

[Chorus]
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...and if you getting dough
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...and all my ladies know
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...cause I ain't leaving till you
BOUNCE, BOUNCE, BOUNCE
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...and if you getting dough
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...and all my ladies know
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...cause I ain't leaving till you
BOUNCE, BOUNCE, BOUNCE!

[VERSE 2]
Stop! Who told you it was cool to mess with this kid?
The city got me paid, so shouts out to my crib
I'm 18 and I got more soldiers than the president
That vanilla drop-top, same color as my skin
BOUNCE! Four-fifteens beat, I make this bass break grounds
This is that ??? that'll make them girls get down
On stage we whilin' until we hear that sound (woop woop)
It's the boys, clear out!
Hit the block in something crucial, polo buttoned up
All of the way up to the top with them fat laces in my Chucks
See I don't give a fuck, never really have
Your girl ain't all that cute, but I'll snatch her just cause I can
Always been the man, never claimed to be the hoodest
Real words couldn't describe me, so tell me who the goodest?
And if music lost its substance, this is hip-hop at its fullest
And if the rap game was a school, then I'd be all you rappers bullies

[Chorus]
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...and if you getting dough
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...and all my ladies know
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...cause I ain't leaving till you
BOUNCE, BOUNCE, BOUNCE
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...and if you getting dough
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...and all my ladies know
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...cause I ain't leaving till you
BOUNCE, BOUNCE, BOUNCE!

[VERSE 3]
Can't nobody get on my level, get up and tell 'em what my name is Kells! (Drop it)
I was pullin dimes when I was a real little boy
And to this day I'm still hollering, still hustling
Still cussing, motherfuck you and the crew you run with
Never been a thang to get off my booty and make them calls and get this money
65 hundred out the trunk, first CD
Look at me now $10 a pop, making millions is easy
Can't nobody see me, and y'all buzzing like bees be
Still hating cause you jealous, y'all just wanna be me
Everything that I do we do the best, get your hating up
Where your money at? Trick please, get your paper up
And I'm in they hood, I must have lost my lid
Fuck 'em says my dirty mouth, I need Orbit
Then I look at my surroundings to find who's hating
There I think I found a pussy cat, yup sure did

[Chorus]
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...and if you getting dough
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...and all my ladies know
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...cause I ain't leaving till you
BOUNCE, BOUNCE, BOUNCE
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...and if you getting dough
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...and all my ladies know
BOUNCE, BOUNCE...cause I ain't leaving till you
BOUNCE, BOUNCE, BOUNCE!
