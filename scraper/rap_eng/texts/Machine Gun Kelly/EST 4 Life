[Intro: Machine Gun kelly]
Let's bring some reality to it
And the whole gang's in here
Yeah, bitch (bitch)

[Verse 1: Machine Gun kelly & Dubo]
Ok, EST for life (Whoop)
40 muthafuckin days, I hustled 40 nights (Let's get it!)
I got 40 deep behind me, ain't a muthafucker nice
40 Swishas, 40 bitches, went from mothafuckin rice

[Dubo]
Shut it down, EST we shut it down
All them bitches know what's up, EST we run it now
And if you think that I'm lying, better go ask somebody
I'm just one out of a million, 'Laced Up' tatted, riding shotty

[Hook: Machine Gun kelly & (Dubo)]
Ok, now all I know is this hustle
(All I want's that cream!)
If you ain't riding then fuck you
(All I got's my team, screaming)
"EST (What the fuck?)"
"EST (What the fuck?)"
"EST (What the fuck?)"
"EST (What the fuck?)"
Ok I do it all for my city
(All I know's these streets!)
Throw it up if you with me
And until I rest in peace I'm screaming
"EST (What the fuck?)"
"EST (What the fuck?)"
"EST (What the fuck?)"
"EST (What the fuck?)"

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly & Dubo]
Ok ok, I see they hide when we come 'round (When we come 'round)
Get the fuck down
I am from the city where they {*Bow*} Love that gun sound
I am from the city where they ride till the sun down
Where they die by this tattoo, I rep mine, so whats up now?

[Dubo]
It's that reckless generation, EST my nation
Muthafuck your time you taking, you know Cleveland my location
Straight shots with no chasing, fuck 'em all in they faces
They were sleeping on that shit I spit so I hock spit in their faces

[Machine Gun Kelly]
I can't take it, everybody better get in their places
Me and all of mine are looking like gorillas, we fitted in all black, you would think we racist
L-L-Light it up like its Vegas
Sh-Sh-Shutting down all that fake shit
And not a damn one of these haters show they faces
They like Craigslist

[Dubo]
Dubo!
(Must let it be known
If you pulling up in my city, you better holla "Daddy, I'm home")
Yeah, we hustle like no other
No love for no sucker, 19-double-X's forever

[Hook]
Ok, now all I know is this hustle
(All I want's that cream!)
If you ain't riding then fuck you
(All I got's my team, screaming)
"EST (What the fuck?)"
"EST (What the fuck?)"
"EST (What the fuck?)"
"EST (What the fuck?)"
Ok I do it all for my city
(All I know's these streets!)
Throw it up if you with me
And until I rest in peace I'm screaming
"EST (What the fuck?)"
"EST (What the fuck?)"
"EST (What the fuck?)"
"EST (What the fuck?)"

[Outro: DJ Xplosive]
These muthafuckas don't know what the fuck going on
It's "EST 4 Life", know what I'm saying?
We gon' ride together, get high together, and best believe we gon' die together
I go by the name of "DJ Xplosive", and I'm staying for this shit
Aye Kells, Dubo, Slim G fuck these hating ass niggas
Either they ride with us, or they hide from us
Let me know, put them L's up, lace the fuck up!
