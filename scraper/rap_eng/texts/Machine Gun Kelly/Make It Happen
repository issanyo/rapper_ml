[Intro]
Okay, I got a question
Am I loud out there?
I mean, do you really hear me? (Huh?)

[Verse 1]
The definition of greatness 
Is in the making you're witnessing the amazing
Blame me if you awaken
You've been sleeping too long on the one who was chosen mufucka
You're probably unaware but I'm here to let you know it
Take a listen, shut the fuck up for once and just enjoy it: Real Music
Bullshit on the daily? try to avoid it
Your life's ass, similar to a toilet huh?
You see me living chasing everything I wanted, huh?
Forever blunted, ready for whatever coming, huh?
The mailman keep the check coming
The cash in keep the 'vette running
Stop sign? Bitch I run that
Look at where I hung at, 
Bunch of Eastside boys on the field, punt that
Ball 4 life
Give me some shrooms for the serotonin
Me and the crew living for the moment
Everything we wanted is ours

[Hook]
Put me in a fast car, 
Big house with a beach for a backyard
Stress free cause I ain't trying to live with it
The state of mind that I'm in got me thinking different
I used to dream until I realized it wasn't shit in reality
Cause you can make it happen
And I'ma make it happen
You gon' watch me make it happen bet you gon remember me
When you see me in that fast car, 
Big house with a beach for a backyard
Stress free I ain't trying to live with it
The state of mind that I'm in got me thinking different
I used to dream until I realized it wasn't shit in reality
Cause you can make it happen
And I'ma make it happen
You gon' watch me make it happen
Bet they gon remember me
Bet they gon remember me 

[Verse 2]
Damn 
So many people got them hating faces
Like why you mad at me? I’m just out here getting faces
Irritated with these bitches and their crazy ways
When all I wanted was some head on a lazy day, damn 
(Where you been?)
On the other side of the map taking naps in first class getting paid to rap
Paid off having jobs since the seventh grade
Got laid off ever since I've been self made
See my homie want to see me win
Fronted me some bands told me "Youngin go and get it in"
He believed in it more than I, So I gotta ride
Down to die for my dawgs, yep, EST 4 Life
Opportunity took advantage I gotta manage
Even when it's hard, hard times, yea,  what would I be without it?
The struggle made me tougher, forcing me to hustle
Money in demand, fuck fame ain't nothing but trouble dawg
I'm never perfect, I got flaws like a lot of ya'll
Who be critizing on the low, hating on ya boy
Ya'll defensive maybe that's why I offend you
When I dribble through my legs in the mall when it's time to ball
Life on the edge, hope I never fall
Though you pray I do, what a shame, but I maintain shooting for the stars
Let it bang bitch i'm out of range
And just know I shoot back with my rap name

[Hook]
Put me in a fast car, big house with a beach for a backyard
Stress free cuz I ain't trying to live with it
The state of mind that I'm in got me thinking different
I use to dream until I realized it wasn't shit in reality
Cuz you can make it happen
And I'ma make it happen
You gon' watch me make it happen bet you gon remember me
When you see me in that fast car, 
Big house with a beach for a backyard
Stress free I ain't trying to live with it
The state of mind that I'm in got me thinking different
I use to dream until I realized it wasn't shit in reality
Cuz you can make it happen
And I'ma make it happen
You gon' watch me make it happen
Bet they gon remember me
They gon' remember me
Bet they gon remember me
Bet they gon remember me
