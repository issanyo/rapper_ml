[Intro: MGK]
Midwest whatup
Let me get my theme music, Kells
Some say, you can only judge a man by what he has
And I got a whole city behind me..

(Whatup, yeah)
Let it run
(Whatup)
I like this
(Whatup, yeah, whatup)
And you know what they say
With great power comes great responsibility (yeah)
And let it be known
I got this

[Verse 1: MGK]
We are, the best motherfuckers in this spot
They can't see who's in it cause the windows all tinted
This is, more than the business, the fame and the image
This is natural, no gimmicks, rappers actin' like Gwyneth
Lumps in my denim they swear I done shitted'
I don't give a flyin' fuck that's why they call me "lieutenant"
Try to play me like a kitten, homie you kiddin?
You rappers are nothing serious, I call you a scrimmage
Breathe, bring it back to the map
We just grinding here first, we just happened to rap
Lost a friend to the night, still battlin' that
There wasn't any type of show, they just happened to clap
Promised him, if you music's a race, I'd be running the track
And if I come out the winner, I ain't runnin' it back
Wasted my whole entire life runnin' from Jack
Once in a lifetime's now and I ain't runnin' from that, yeah
We own the night, all black Chucks on
The new generation, no black tux on
Rather fitted jeans, no inches to cut on
And the talent that you willin' to bet a million bucks on
This is my story, so this is real shit
Everything I want, this is what the real get
Dream big, the Empire State feelin'
Money taller than the Empire State building
Don't get it twisted, I ain't rich yet, but I'm straight
Whoever thought I'd make that killin' of my wordplay
I did, I've been knowing since the first day
Revenge can be many things, success is the worst way
I see they faces now, but I'm way too real to care
My night is coming soon, I feel it in the air
Somebody's gotta run the town before the smoke clears
This kingdom is now without a king, look people I'm here

[Hook: Rihanna]
Life’s a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don’t care
So I keep doing my own thing
Walking tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind is who’s gonna run this town tonight
Hey (etc.)
Who’s gonna run this town tonight

[Outro: MGK]
This is what greatness sounds like, y'all
So beautiful don't you agree?
You know who it is
Kells
