Now there's a meaning to this thing called life
But you just gotta find it in this thing called strife
I wish I could rewind and show you this is all hype
Show you just because they stars doesn't mean they got stripes, for real though
But me, I got them verses that'll kill though
And me, I'm EST now that's a family I would kill for
Shout out to the fans who held me down before the deal though
And I can't forget my team, I pray one day we make a million, and blow it all
Cause when we die we ain't taking it with us
Materials make a king, knowledge makes an apprentice
Now ain't that backwards we impressed by the fame in this era
Shit, my girl a queen, she don't need a tiara
We don't need an umbrella either just give us the rain
We don't need help, they the built the pyramids without a crane
Insane sometimes I feel we born without a brain
They only looking at the dollars, what I'm lookin' for is change
I'm sayin, if that shit doesn't register, might as well get used to stealing singles out the register
Baby momma calling, she need 30 for a pedicure
Student loan collector blow your phone up on the regular
This isn't even it baby, this isn't it baby
We supposed to have a condo and a crib baby
But you forgot the first rule of the game
They don't remember riches, they just remember the name
Kells...

Now go and get it homie
One thing for sure I know the block ain't gonna get it for me
Two thing's for certain, I ain't tryna let em pidgeon toe
And if they is just know I'm walking with my pistol on me
This ain't that B shit or C shit, this is that D-o-r-D shit
That means Do or Die, cause ain't no you, if it's you and I
I ain't no gangster but I will be just to stay alive
I'm rollin' indica, staying high
Roll to the cinema and stay the night
My life's like TV with this daytime drama
All this Law and Order, a lot of comedy
And relationships like Tina and Ike, these bitches crazy
That's why I'm tellin' ya
Look up to the stars instead of staring at a cellular
You could be the greatest why would you wanna be regular?
Just know that your greatness comes from how they gon' remember ya
Not from how you spend baby, that isn't it baby
Man we ain't gotta have a condo or a crib baby
But you forgot the first rule of the game
They don't remember riches, they just remember the name...

Rose from the ashes like a Phoenix
Rose feelin', rose feelin' up in the marinas
Got my weight up in my hood we call that triple-beamin'
Fuck introductions, skip the name and just call me Cleveland
Homie callin' for bail, tryna get out the precinct
Tellin' me give 'em hell, funny I started preaching
And when I say I got us bet the city gon' believe 'em
Cause everybody left us and they know I'm never leaving
So I turn it up one time for the days runnin' on the corner
Talkin' shit and getting lit from sippin' brews in Arizona
And when one time came through everybody gone except for me
I couldn't leave, I am the loner, with the mind of a stoner
And dreams of putting this game in a choker
And fuckin' until she pay me like Oprah
I'm not a hoper, I'm a knower of what's in the forecast like Al Roker
So even if it pours, I am Noah, two oars
Two rowers, row us to two shores
I found promise land, now we lying on two floors
One for the fam, the other for two whores, shit
Fuck two minutes, I did this in two chords, of course
I'm too versatile for a chorus
I've done too many tours to be a tourist
Fuck the magazine, I am the Source
I am too boss to be employed, more stories about your boy than Chuck Norris
Man, listen up

All I know, all I know
I am from the city where the grass don't grow
I am from the city in the middle of the map
Where half these motherfuckers that rap don't go
All I know, all I know
If I throw this cash then her ass gets low
But I am from the city where the cash don't flow
So I keep it for myself and I smash that ho
Smash that ho, smash that ho
Treat her like a bop it and I pass that ho
But I ain't saying nothing that my fans don't know
I'm an EST boy till the casket close
Six foot deep, six foot three
Eight motherfuckers in the SUV
Eight new states in a seven day week
Whole world laced up like some brand new sneaks
And they know I'm gonna raise till I'm face up
Fuck check-out time, we don't wake up
Damn these EST boy's done came up
Dirty ass chucks and a bad bitch lace up
