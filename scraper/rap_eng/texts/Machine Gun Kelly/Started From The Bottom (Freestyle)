[Intro]
Still in the basement, where it started

[Verse 1]
Started from the bottom, now we here
Courtside, you would think I was a Cleveland Cavalier
I’m talking 30,000 feet up in the air
In Dan's lair, 30 minutes later all the fans cheer, bitch
You ain’t seen this power since LeBron
I went to vegas for my 22nd, rented out the Palms
Now they say illuminati is the cause
Or maybe everyone of y’all is lazy and I worked hard
I ain’t never bowing down for a dollar
Selling my soul to a charter
I wouldn’t even take a buck from my father
But they weren't saying that back in the day
When I was hustling tickets to my shows, ask dante
And I heard tempers heating up like a filet
Talking 'bout they run my city when they livin in LA
Sucker, I ain’t hearin nothing bout a word
Talked about it, been about it, bitch I got what I deserved
See I don’t know why everybody mad
You had your chance and you blew it
Meanwhile, I’m young and I’m ruthless
Meanwhile, the dumb are influenced
Thinking you live like the music
Don’t be foolish
My shooters make your face maroon like the Hoosiers (Braahh)
Suckers always wanna talk funny
Broke motherfuckers never wanna talk money
And since I was being quiet in the past
I’m on the top looking down, kiss my ass
Still in the game with my same clique
Still with the hood bitches fuck Cambridge
And when they wanna know if I’m real
I say "Bitch I ran my city 'fore I ever had a deal"
Kells

[Outro]
Little bitch
For my city
EST, what the fuck?
Lace up!
