[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly & Kid Ink]
Walk a mile in my Chucks, see where you end up
You can tell 'em that
I've been through hell and back

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
You can tell 'em that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on, I fire back
In this cold world, where your lighters at
Let's burn it down, f-f-fire back
You can tell 'em that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on, I fire back
In this cold world, where your lighters at
Let's burn it down, f-f-fire back

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, let’s burn it down, underrated
Could never say I was underground
Maybe a little misunderstood when I’m just riding round
In all lanes, like OJ
Doing big things, no small change
We ain’t going nowhere like wine stains
You see me with the arsenal
Welcome to the arson show
Alumni, lace up, don’t trip, I got it, bro
Sold out in my city, overseas in your state
Wore double X-L white T’s as a freshman
To the XXL 2012 freshman
Damn, I rose up, in the front like Rosa
It’s been a roller coaster, now I’m ridin' in a Rover
See the camera’s out, but you gotta stay focused
They expose us, but it’s still so much
I swear that y'all don’t no-tice man
You could tell 'em that I’ve been through hell and back
But I’m home, yeah, took a long time getting here
But I’m finally in my zone
So gone off that loud you can hear in my tone
Put your lighters in the air
Let’s start a firestorm

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
You can tell 'em that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on, I fire back
In this cold world, where your lighters at
Let's burn it down, f-f-fire back
You can tell 'em that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on, I fire back
In this cold world, where your lighters at
Let's burn it down, f-f-fire back

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
As we bow our heads
Amen, praise God for everyone
That made it out of dark like caveman
And is this my moment? Shit, cause I’ve been waiting
Came in the game the least favorite
Made it through rain, now it’s haling
I’m just saying
Hell and back ain’t no trip for me
Please Satan don’t hold me back
God said this ain’t it for me
But these haters done got me trapped
(I swear to God y'all can't see me, motherfucker)
Shit and it’s these haters that got me strapped
Paranoid 'bout my friends cause these favors done got me jack
Consequence of all the misdemeanors
That I was willing to do to get some rougher ends
Until the cops (Woop, woop)
Then I’d hop the fence and steal me an old school like Das EFX
Another call collect and it's sad cause
Those are friends that you grew with
Telling me they knew that I’d make it
Now you got the chance to go prove it, gone
Pay stubs, cold cash
Work this and I sold that
Wrote this in my note pad and spilled more ink than my whole tat
Spill blood on that stage, uh
I’m the truth and they know that
Critics lie but these numbers don’t
Say hello to this gold plaque, it’s Kells

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
You can tell 'em that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on, I fire back
In this cold world, where your lighters at
Let's burn it down, f-f-fire back
You can tell 'em that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on, I fire back
In this cold world, where your lighters at
Let's burn it down, f-f-fire back
