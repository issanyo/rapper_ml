[Intro]

[Talking]
Hang on Dante, they said them Cleveland boys don't got no heat

[Verse]
Shit,bitch you know I never give a f-, oh damn my bad
Can't say shit when I'm in my jag
Word gotta flow when I hit that gas, way too fast
Came up with a little bit of change, quick cash
Haters wanna see me fall quick like ass
