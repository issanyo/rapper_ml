[Verse 1]
Yo I was, raised on a seperate side of the track in the land where the wild things roam
Open up my closet see a tall leaf growin, pick a leaf off of the stem take it all to the dome
Callin it, the Alice in Wonderland, spiralin down the medium better known as time I'm stumblin
Come back to my senses from the sounds of thunderin, trees talkin to me wonderin if ill ever come again
Every single day until I'm seein the sun again
Starin at the ripples skippin rocks in the pond again
Stimulatin every single cell while I'm ponderin
And the green leaves are fallin and shrivelin like the Summer end
What shall I do, where do I go
I want the fumes in put the towel under the door
I'm feelin the dro, puff it in and releasin the smoke
Its not enough for me, I want it if u got it fa sho
There are, things talkin to me mommy I swear
I'm seein figures in the dark get up and nobodys there
Intangible shadows are fucking with me reaching for nuthin
So I take a hit of this Alice now I'm hopin for somethin
Fuck all the puffin, elmer it up get to the huffin
Treat it like christmas turkeys open up and get to the stuffin
See if I'm bluffin, I'm ready to go to the moon
Ill do whatever whenever promise it'll get me there soon

[Hook]
I'm lost in my own mind, where do I go
I swear This wonderland's not what I used to know
(voices in my head telling me to go to)
Wonderland (blisseded up feel the smoke run my hands
Wonderland (twisted up, sip it chop it if you in)
Wonderland (Sit back let me how show u how it begin)
Wonderland (where my mind I think I lost in the end)

[Verse 2]
Take me to the twilight zone, no lights on
At the altitude where u be seein all the kites flown,(YEAH)
Family concerned and convinced that my mind gone
And they right, last night first class flights gone,HEY
Mommy why the fuck the flowypier gotta mouth now
Conversatin why I'm layin on the ground now
About face told me to get out now
See the revolution of tomorrow in the clouds now
So far gone, but I'm not Drizzy
Cleveland's own but I'm not Bizzy
Nope no bone well then who is he?
I don't even know anymore I swear I done went crazy (BAHH)
All this talk about the life and the ice in the right hands could get u the dream and a nice tan
But they don't say is the price is ya life plus a slice of ya soul as man and ya right hand
21 as long the cards set right
Drop on my saliva gave my card deck life
Queen of hearts tryna take away my best type
The Ace of Spade make a muthafucka bet right
Creepy crawlers tryna sneak up gimme bed bites
Hide under the cover keep intruders out my bed life
Hug the pillow keep it tucked under my head tight
So the toothfairy cannot get up in my head, night

[Hook]
