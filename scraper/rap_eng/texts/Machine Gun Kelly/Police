[Verse 1: Pooh Gutta]
Pooh Gutta, I'm nice
Before I snitch I do life, twice
They gonna hate me for this line, but oh well
But a nigga couldn't have snitched on so well
Suck my dick your honor, this suit right here designer
It's death before dishonor, I'll be out this bitch tomorrow
Like I never, ever ever, ever been gone
Taliban, who is dat? Bitch my clique been on
Hold up let's just speak the real, bitch I ain't them dirty birds
Got thirty niggas in thirty cars them boys move about thirty birds
Scared money don't make shit, porsche trucks no breaks bitch
Straight shots no chase bitch, I wild out I break shit

[Hook]

Po-lice, Po-lice, Po-lice

[Verse 2: MGK]
Fuck the 5-0, motherfuck the 5-0
Bitch I'm from the East but I busted them boys like I'm 5-0
All black shoes like capo, mafioso on my side ho
And I got lobsters for my partners, and they got choppers for my rivals
EST to the death of me, Taliban to the left of me
All I got is my dick and these bitches suck till they get the rest of me
Ain't none of y'all arresting me, free my brother Jay Rock
Shout out to my city those boys are harder than a yay rock
Fuck these snitches, I don't know you snitches
I was a felon at fourteen cause I didn't ride on all you bitches
Now I'm free and I got this loud yellin' on your bitches
Duckin' this red and blue when I'm rollin' green and hailin' on yo bitches

[Hook]
