[Hook]
Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[Verse 1]
Kells,
All these pretty lights, 
Can’t you see em?
Endless nights
In my life's museum
Where we see our heroes
And pretend to be em
And we seize the day
Carpe Diem
Previous to this dream state I had leftovers on each plate
Left shoe all tattered up from this long journey my feet ache
Left the life that I lived because everyday was just replays,
And I dreamed big, walked around in my PJ's
And my street days are still here
Never changed like I still wear
The same pair
Phone call? what for?
We ain't long distance, I’m still there
Still on the blocks where gun cocks and gunshots are more familiar of a sound then what’s "hot"
12 dollar showers at truck stops would give anybody motivation that you must not lose this one shot...

Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[Verse 2]
Demon days
Evil nights
Happy hours
Frequent flights,
God flow
People’s strife
Hear it once
Speak it twice
Hearts never break even
And they change color like seasons
Backs turn like treason
But somehow you swear you ain't leaving
Follow me now, follow me now
Spoon fulls of sugar and handfuls of medicine help it go down
Help it go down
I was just a fool in a room full of Edison's, look at me now
Look at me now
Feel my words
Look at this sound
Reminiscin on when I was lookin out on the city wishin a million muthafuckas gave me that crown, bitch I run this town

Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[Outro]
Kells
All of the people out there with me right now
Raise your muthafuckin flags
See this is the beginning, 
This is ours, 
This is black flag
