Dopeman
Dopeman
Fuck the police
JP Did This One

[Verse 1]
I just hung up wit the dope man
He just pulled up in the O van
Piece in my pocket click clack
Bitch I don't trust nobody, get back
My tempo is slurred
Twist that hash wit my herb
Mix that soda and syrup
Holdin' my strap like The Purge
Undercovers is the undercovers
Run motherfucker run motherfucker
My homie Tone threw his 45 on the ground
Both got lost and they never get found
Cut through the park stay low, stay low
Hear the pitbulls bark, there they go
I should've went to class this month
But I said fuck that I'm ghost, so
I just rolled up on the dope man
Ay, young gunna, OKAY

[Bridge]
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man

[Hook]
I got my slang from the dope man
I always wanna hang wit the dope man
I learned this game from the dope man
Everybody give it up for the dope man
I got my slang from the dope man
I always wanna hang wit the dope man
I learned this game from the dope man
Everybody give it up for the dope man

[Verse 2]
I just got a scale by the way
Shout out Patty Cake by the way
Told me never put a whole gram in a dime
Give 'em point seven and them fools be fine
But how you gon' sell by the way
You ain't got a clientele by the way
I'ma hit Tri-C wit a couple packs
And if the motherfuckers sellin I'ma double back
Phone ringin more than the operator
And the dealers who deliver gettin all the paper
I spend Sunday trapping on Union
Serving my people like Communion
Can I front 'em a ten? (No)
I am not a friend (No)
Give me money, take this (dope)
Can I get an amen?
Kells!

Okay

[Bridge]
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man

[Hook]
I got my slang from the dope man
I always wanna hang wit the dope man
I learned this game from the dope man
Everybody give it up for the dope man
I got my slang from the dope man
I always wanna hang wit the dope man
I learned this game from the dope man
Everybody give it up for the dope man

[Outro]
We gotta make some money
It can help us out with a better car
Man fuck his son
You gotta better idea?
It's gonna be somethin' ya'know
We can get a job at Mcdonald's
Man we can't get no bitches smellin' like french fries
We can get fat bitches
