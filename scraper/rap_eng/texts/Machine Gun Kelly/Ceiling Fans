[Chorus]
I don't recall ever graduating at all
Sitting in my room watching ceiling fans in the wall
Ceiling fans in the wall, ceiling fans in the wall
Living for today because we never promised tomorrow
I don't recall ever graduating at all
Sitting in my room watching ceiling fans in the wall
Ceiling fans in the wall, ceiling fans in the wall
Living for today because we never promised tomorrow

[VERSE 1]
The elevators broken, the stairs second room on the left
I seen my ex on my mattress sucking my dude for a check
She ain't say nuttin while he nuttin', she was in for the money
He in it from the back because even he knew he was frontin'
But you know, can't be too careful
In the hood, that's what they there for
Even your kin ain't your friend, they heart hollow as air holes
That's exactly how I spit it, it's exactly how I live it
Like a drunk man on his gimmick, ceiling fans still spinning
Turn around see the smoke fill up my living quarters
Packing gun shells dipped in water, that's what you go tell your daughter
Opened up the bathroom door and seen somebody shooting up
Peek-a-boo'd out those window shutters seen somebody shooting up
Bam, duck, bust, that's what procedure calls
Not knowing, not being involved but gets you locked behind them walls
I just lost one of my closest friends to the jury
Ceiling blades on the fan keep turning, and you know


[Chorus]
I don't recall ever graduating at all
Sitting in my room watching ceiling fans in the wall
Ceiling fans in the wall, ceiling fans in the wall
Living for today because we never promised tomorrow
I don't recall ever graduating at all
Sitting in my room watching ceiling fans in the wall
Ceiling fans in the wall, ceiling fans in the wall
Living for today because we never promised tomorrow


[VERSE 2]
They say what's up with your lifestyle, you living off a dream
Staring at ceilings till that lint in your pocket turn into green
