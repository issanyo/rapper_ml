[Intro]
So, you right
Yeah, Gunner

[Verse]
Ayy, ready to die
But I can't I'm too alive
Should've killed me when they tried
Couldn't see me in the skies
When you camouflaged, eating pad thai, hahaha
I don't get regular high (nah)
I ain't no regular guy (no)
I think I want the entire planet, you can keep the American Pie (hey)
And you know I never lie
I kept the same number (ahah)
So when you call me (what?)
I pick up and say, "fuck you" (damn)
And I say it to your face bitch, you can run and tell it to the clique (clique)
Two nines in the waist (ayy)
My gun and my dick
Watch, I put it in reverse
Put that pussy in a hearse
Watch me murder with a verse
Put these rappers in the dirt
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who the realest of 'em all? (who?)
You already know the answer
Top Gun, fuck 'em all (ayy)
Y'all got ulterior motives (motives)
My interior designer put them cameras all around
So let me find out you creeping, I come and split your shit like Moses
My exterior is frozen
I'm from Cleveland, we the coldest
So it's no coincidence that when you try to take a pic, it's too much ice for you to focus (ugh)
Riding shotty 'cause I got to roll this dope, it's a fast road (skrrt)
(get off me)
She got body, she look like a centerfold and her ass swole (she got it, she got it, ayy), yeah
Feel like Gotti how I pull up on your block smoking Castro (skrrt)
Ayy, never hesitate to say it to your face, I'm a asshole (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Riding shotty 'cause I got to roll this dope, it's a fast road (skrrt)
