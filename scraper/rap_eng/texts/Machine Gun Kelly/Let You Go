[Bridge]
Since you left, I've been holding on to a memory
Since you walked out that door (Yeah)
And you said I changed and you're so damn sick of me
You're not mine anymore, 2-3-4

[Chorus]
Woah, woah
She said you need to let me go
Woah, woah
She said I'd die for you, you're like my drug but I can't get high off you
You're not mine anymore

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I still remember what you wore on the first night
Still remember how that black dress had your curves right
Still remember smokin' just to calm my nerves
'Til you had to leave and grabbed your purse, I grabbed first
Uh, it's no words, yeah, it's just her
Body against mine, makeup on my shirt
Lipstick on my neck, whiskey on my breath
Taking pictures in the moment so we don't forget, yeah

[Chorus]
Woah, woah
She said you need to let me go
Woah, woah
She said I'd die for you, you're like my drug but I can't get high off you
You're not mine anymore

[Verse 2]
And I can't be myself without you
I am not well
Okay, I said that before but
I need you now, yeah

[Chorus]
Woah, woah
She said you need to let me go
Woah, woah
She said I'd die for you, you're like my drug but I can't get high off you
You're not mine anymore

[Bridge]
Since you left, I've been holding on to a memory
Since you walked out that door
And you said I changed and you're so damn sick of me
You're not mine anymore

[Chorus]
Woah, woah
She said you need to let me go
Woah, woah
She said I'd die for you, you're like my drug but I can't get high off you
You're not mine anymore
