I said it before
I'll say it again:
One, two, rock, rock , rock!
Fuck, fuck, who want what?
I got a couple vans with my mans in the front
They got a couple cans, gas in the cup
We ain't at a shell station but the hands on the pump
Yeah, burn this mother fucker down
The roof isn't on fire, but i bet it is now
And if I'm on the bottom when it all falls down
I'mma show 'em what i got
Make it all fall now!

I just want, I just want
I just want, I just want
I just want, I just want
I just want, i just want
I said it before
I say it again:
I, JUST, WANT, To...
1, 2, woo woo

Welcome to the rage
Welcome to the mosh pit
Welcome to the stage
I got a bottle and if anybody hates
I'mma pick it up and hit this motherfucker in their face
Oh, shit! Yeah, bitch!
20 shots of jack
What the fuck ya'll know about that?

What, what
What, what
What, what
What, what
Oh shit
What, what
Oh, oh shit, here we go!
I said it before
I say it again:
What, what
What, what
What, what
What, what
The shit, here we go!
1, 2, woo woo
