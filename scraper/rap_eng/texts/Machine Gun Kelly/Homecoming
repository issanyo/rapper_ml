[VERSE 1]
It's been a long time coming, but I'm finally home
They used to call me kid, that boy is finally grown
Came from the rock bottom, look at how far I've come
Couldn't wait for the day to say father, look at your son
Took what was impossible and turned it to a dream
Until I lost so much sleep it became reality
They say that what goes up, must come down
I'm that ashy, that classy, poster child
So I roll out my red carpet, break out my red garments
Haters wanting my dead, break out my red target
They question what I've started, I tell 'em several things
They asked me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything

[Chorus]
They asked me what I've started, I tell 'em several things
They asked me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything
My heart is all in it, losing is off limits
Reputation matches my attire, I'm authentic
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, tell 'em its my homecoming

[VERSE 2]
I have outgrew so many things, the hood does not fit me
But I can't forget my past, I brought the whole hood with me
Because I love my city, it made me who I am
Tattoo read city boy, but I'm the city's man
You'll never break me down, they wish I was afraid
Out of all the situations I've fought for, you'd think I'd run away?
??? a thousand depths and I ain't hurt yet
Taught how to be a man, but to be a sucka, I ain't learnt yet
So everybody put your drinks up, let's toast to who didn't need no help
Now swing one back for anybody who got one they goddamn selves
I bring it back for the city and they put on for me
We celebrating the beginning, this my homecoming

[Chorus]
They asked me what I've started, I tell 'em several things
They asked me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything
My heart is all in it, losing is off limits
Reputation matches my attire, I'm authentic
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, tell 'em it's my homecoming

[VERSE 3]
I told 'em what I wanted, what I meant this what I need
It's not just I, it's everyone that's depending on me
I pour my heart in these beats to soar up outta these streets
Pour victory bottles till liquor knocks us out on these sheets
I say it straight faced, I feel it's owed to me
Monopolize like Rockerfeller, that's the HOV in me
My father couldn't even influence my ways
So why the fly-fuck you think I care what a haters gotta say?
I know exactly why they hate, they know exactly why I'm great
They put in work and I work harder, they follow I innovate, YES
I never claimed the title, I was given the throne
Cleveland's American Idol, the king is finally home

[Chorus]
They asked me what I've started, I tell 'em several things
They asked me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything
My heart is all in it, losing is off limits
Reputation matches my attire, I'm authentic
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, tell 'em its my homecoming

[OUTRO]
Roll out the red carpet, break out my red garments
Haters wanting me dead, break out the red targets
They ask me what I started, I tell 'em several things
They ask me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything
Break out the red carpet, break out my red garments
Haters wanting me dead, break out the red targets
They ask me what I started, I tell 'em several things
They ask me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything
