[Intro]
Coming out the Midwest (X5)
Coming out the Midwest Side!

[Verse 1]
Come join the movement, man!
Welcome!
To a little city in the middle like Malcolm
Walk anywhere I want its Kells
And if they got a problem with me (huh) god help 'em
I go hard!
See me in a regular strip
In the crib, fucking 'round with a regular bitch
Never Hollywood; I still with my regular click,
King of my city, still on some regular shit!
Im in this man, live this man
Ask my town they witnessed man
All my haters finished them
See my ass, they kissed it now!
Fuck these hoes!
Fuck these hoes!
One more time like, fuck these hoes!
Tatted it on my arm now everybody knows
Bitch I’m from the double O
Where no other kid on the block running like me
Don't nobody shoot movies about us
Cause ain't shit about us is pretend
So if you can stand the heat,then get the fuck up out the kitchen!
Another young soul gone missing
When you step into the

[Hook:]

Get, get up off your knees, boy!
Release my N-U-T's, boy

Smoke up all the trees, boy

Drove right over to Minneapolis, said what's up to Indiana
Fuck my bitch down there in Kansas
Midwest side, I swear to god I'll die for this and that's my word
Rolling down 271 flipping the bird!

[Hook:]

[Outro]
They tried sleeping on the front coast
And these 808 woke them the fuck up
Lace up till you face up
EST to the death, you whack, bitch!
And I ain't the Midwest Congressman!
