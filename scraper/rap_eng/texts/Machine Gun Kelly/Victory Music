[Hook: Britni Elise]
I put it all on the line and pray that God gets me through it, through it
Came here with nothin' and I don't know any other way to do it
And it’s my victory music, yeah, it’s my victory music

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I like the way this feels man
Kells bring it back to the map, right up in the middle of it's where you finding me at
Labels wanna holla, this is where they’re signing me at
Cause my city told me they need me so I’m grindin' for that
Same clothes, same street, same chucks, same feet
Same kid I used to be moppin the floors up every week
I paid the cost to be the boss
Let’s just say I ain’t cheap, cause now the same kid is living off a check from every beat
I’m from middle west, where they don’t forget where they’re from
What they’re representing their home mines just tatted on my arm
And I forever be about it as long as air is in my lungs
Speaking to you as the kid and I'm as real as they come
I made a dollar out of cents got a whole nation’s respect
Before I was 18 and I did that without a check
See I used to be a lame now I’m posted in the game, in a top spot
Tough drop, money ain’t a thing

[Hook: Britni Elise]
I put it all on the line and pray that God gets me through it
Came here with nothin' and I don't no any other way to do it
And it’s my victory music, yeah, it’s my victory music

[Machine Gun Kelly]
Let me get them, west coast, let me get them, down south
Let me get them, up north, let me get them, yeah
Let me get them, where’s that, let me get them, east coast
Let me get them, mid west, let me get them, go

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uh, dedicated to my fans and everyone who wanna see me win
I swear my life’s a major motion picture from beginning to the end
Only thing is I ain’t Hollywood and this here ain't pretend
Haters try and pull me down but I’m too high up in the air
Here I’m try and talk down but I’m too high to even care
I’m on top of the world and I got my baby girl here
She don’t worry about a thing as long as daddy’s right there
Yeah, from the bentches to the league, fought through hell and back to get a dream
Cause as a lightweight, you gotta learn to use your pounds right
From the bottom to the top this is for victory sounds like

[Hook: Britni Elise]
I put it all on the line and pray that God gets me through it
Came here with nothin' and I dont know any other way to do it
And it’s my victory music, yeah, it’s my victory music
