[Chorus]
The dark side of the moon looks like an only child who can't fit into place
The dark side of the moon looks like a single mother bruises on her face
The dark side of the moon looks like somebody’s sister yelling out "rape"
The dark side of the moon is eminent because you can’t escape fate
Yeah, the dark side of the moon

[Verse 1]
Tommy was young 
Tommy had everything you could want as an adolescent except for having fun
Tommy was young
Susceptible to all the repercussions of being a drunk fathers only son
Tommy was dumb
Get your ass in that room till I come back you piece of shit
But dad would never come..
Tommy was dumb
Students would laugh at him and attack him after their classes until Tommy would run
Tommy was numb
Too many years of feeling degraded now hatred is the only feeling that comes
Tommy was numb
Fuck this
Ran into his high school 
Tommy's got a gun

[Chorus]
The dark side of the moon looks like an only child who can't fit into place
The dark side of the moon looks like a single mother bruises on her face
The dark side of the moon looks like somebody’s sister yelling out "rape"
The dark side of the moon is eminent because you can’t escape fate
Yeah, the dark side of the moon

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
Hailey's in love
But Hailey's in 7th grade entertaining and dating a 21 year old scrub
Hailey's in love
Bailing on class to give him some action in the back of his daddy’s old truck
Now Hailey threw up
A couple weeks after their interaction, guess her man didn’t use no glove
Hailey knew but
Couldn’t bear it to watch the parents she loved and cherished see their little girl knocked up
Hailey's school bus 
Got the word about what happened now even the faculty is whispering that she’s a slut
Hailey's in love
But Hailey's more afraid of being hated now her and her baby brainless in the tub, damn
