[Verse 1]
I ain't slept in months y'all
Eyes so red I can't see what's real
R-r-roll me up a blunt dog
Sorry but this is the way that I live
And if the world so big why can't I fit in?
Feels just like folks back in the sit in
Because I ain't goin' no where unless I eat and
I won't play the game cause everybody cheat but
I will pay the toll cause life ain't cheap
Keep Pac on the beat all eyes on me
See I on the streets not I
In-the-stry eye for an eye when it comes to the beef
Got a problem with me don't come to the C
216 to the 213 that's what I call 21 jump street
Never jump ship though that shit weak same crew
Same boat muhfuka' don't sink I'm sayin'

[Hook]
Long nights, contemplating
Stopping Satan from taking my life
Bright lights, dark places
Strange faces, this is my life
This is my life, this is my life
This is my life

[Interlude]
Let me tell you something you already know
The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows
It's a very mean and nasty place and i don't care how
Tough you are it will beat you to your knees and will
Keep you there permanently if you let it you, me or
Nobody will hit as hard as life but it ain't about how
Hard you hit it's about how hard you can get hit and
Keep moving forward how much you can take and keep
Moving forward that's how winners done (how winners done)
(how winners done) (how winners done)

[Hook]
Long nights, contemplating
Stopping Satan from taking my life
Bright lights, dark places
Strange faces, this is my life
This is my life, this is my life
This is my life

[Outro]
Now if you know what you're worth now go out and get what
You're worth but you got to be willing to take the hits
And not pointin' fingers sayin' you ain't where you want to be
Because of him or her or anybody cowards do that and that ain't
You, you're better than that (that that that that that that that)
