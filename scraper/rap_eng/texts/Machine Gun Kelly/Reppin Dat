[VERSE 1: Dub-O]
Look, Bad bitches wanna fuck (wanna fuck)
Look, my last bitch wasn’t enough (wasn’t enough)
Look, she wouldn’t rep it on a head stand
Look, she wouldn’t rep and hit my headband, band
Man I’m so far in my zone
And I just got off a tour, I was so far away from home
But I been reppin' it the whole time
Till I got work, Dub-O it’s show time

EST I REP, CLE where I slept
Double X on my right, I got laced up on my left
EST I REP, CLE where I slept
Double X on my right, I got laced up on my left

[HOOK: Dub-O]
I been reppin that, I been reppin that
I been reppin that, I been reppin that
I been reppin that, I been reppin that
Since way back
I been reppin that, I been reppin that
I been reppin that, I been reppin that
I been reppin that, I been reppin that
Since way back
Way back, way back, way back, way back
I been reppin that, I been reppin that
Since way back
Way back, way back, way back, way back
I been reppin that, I been reppin that
Since way back


[VERSE 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Kells, bad bitches, I give two fucks
Literally two fucks, two nuts for my two nuts
Ugh, talk down, you’ll get bruised up
Bitch I’m stone cold, Medusa
Show me love like I’m ‘Pac
Mix Hennessy with my pot
I’m the fuckin’ man on my label
Disrespect and get dropped
I done paid rent for a bottle of champagne
Good god damn, we be doing the damn thing
I was getting money while these rappers was hating
And I be fuckin' bitches on the day they turn 18
But I can’t, fall in love with no rat
Soldiers never catch feelings, in Cleveland just like Iraq
Motherfuckers ain’t smoking, if you don't roll em this fat
And motherfuckers ain’t riding, if you ain’t waving this flag, Rep that
