Mosh pit, mosh pit everything in this bitch (You know)

Four shot, five shot, six shots, I love it
Jump up and down white boys in here (Ahh)
Chug on a beer
Don't want to party fuck out of here (Ahh)

Fuck up the club standing on the chair (Squad)
Spraying champagne cause I really don't care (You know)
