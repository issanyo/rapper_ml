[Verse 1]
Uh, this ain't no halo over my head, bitch
But dear God, can you forgive the sinning
For everything I done did since my beginning
Because the devil around me so much that you would think I got a death wish?
Yeah, and the voices in my head get louder
Watching my career disappear like powder (Poof)
Wish I could rewind those hours and get my life back (Back)
Strike that, clinging to this weed like a life jacket (Yeah)
Fuck rapping, I was really living everything that I was spitting, bitch
What's happening? (Wassup)
Fights daily, nights crazy, dream chasing till the drugs came in
I was chopping up them bitches like Jason
Had a muthafucker's face laying on the cold pavement (Uh)
Wake up, take 'em, now I feel sane (Whoop)
Spending every penny in the studio slaving (Yeah)
Me and my mob working any odd job
Praying that this little dream was gonna feed our babies
Save me Lord, save me Lord, what the fuck is this curse you gave me Lord?
Everybody think I finally made it Lord, but all I am now is a slave, my God

[Interlude]
And Revelation says
"He will wipe every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more
Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore
For the former things have passed away"
EST for life, muthafucker!

[Verse 2]
Ughk, put that halo around my neck, bitch (Bitch)
And gimmie death
I'm twenty-two and this twenty-two on my left, God bless
Maybe I'll finally sleep
Maybe they'll return what's originally mine, cause finder's keep
Maybe I will be great, and this voice of mine was designed to be the finest key
But, I'm losing faith (Ok)
Everyday they got news to break
Like my single flopped, and now I ain't hot
And they don't know if Imma ever gonna see the light of day
It's "My labels mad" or "My albums bad" or "You ain't living up to the hype we thought you had"
Or I lost a fan, or I'm in cuffs again
Yeah, meanwhile I ain't there to be my daughter's dad
Fuck what's meant for me, because I don't ever wanna become a celebrity
I don't ever want someone to feel less than me
So put your camera down and stand next to me (Right here!)
EST, Everyone Stand Together
And if I, ever R-I-P, then I know everything I stand for's forever
Lace Up!

[Outro]
And when you play this song
Hold your head high, muthafucker
Don't ever look down because of who you are
Our flaws are what makes us perfect
