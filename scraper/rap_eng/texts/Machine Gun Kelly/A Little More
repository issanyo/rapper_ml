[Pre-Hook: Victoria Monet]
I screamed at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yo, I had a dream that the world changed
And for a minute there was no pain
Instead of presidents and old sayings
I heard lyrics from Kurt Cobain
Then i wake up to see the world's ill
Oceans tainted from the oil spills
How many kids have these wars killed?
How many families can't afford bills?
I wish that i could let the world know
That it's okay to let the pain show
And even though times seem bad
It always rains before the rainbow.​

[Pre-Hook: Victoria Monet]
I screamed at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?

[Hook: Victoria Monet + Machine Gun Kelly]
I think we all need a little more love
I think we all need a little more love
We just need a little more love
The world needs a little more love

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Kells, In my hood money equals power
And in the world money controls everything we believe in
I can see we're in our darkest hour
Cause it feels like the government just as crooked as the police
I spent the weekend catching up on the news
A girl committed suicide after she was bullied at school
Cause some dudes told her she wasn't cool
But you would rather gossip about a famous person breaking the rules
I'm confused, tell me is my life's price worth the jewels?
They told me fight night i'm supposed to lose
Just ​'​cause in hindsight, they don't like my type:
White boy with some rhythm and blues
Kells

[Pre-Hook: Victoria Monet]
I screamed at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?

[Hook: Victoria Monet + Machine Gun Kelly]
I think we all need a little more love
I think we all need a little more love
We just need a little more love
The world needs a little more love

[Outro-Verse: Machine Gun Kelly + Victoria Monet]
You can give up like they tell you, stop like they tell you
Be scared to dream for the top like they tell you
​but I'm tryIng to tell you
Fuck what they tell you

[Outro: Machine Gun Kelly & Victoria Monet]
​And in these dark times
​As a part of a generation they claim can't be saved it’s important to know we’re not blind
​We see the truth through blue and dark eyes
​And I would rather die on my feet then live on my knees if I can't live free
Right now in the world we just need
A little more love
A little more love
​a A more love
