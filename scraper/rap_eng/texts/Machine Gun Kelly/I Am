We took it to the top from the bottom
Adversities, I fought 'em
They never said I'd get it and I got 'em
I am that kid, I am that soul
I am that boy they looking for, I am

I hustle, I grind, I push it, I shine
They know that (I am) that kid
(I am) Kells (I am) Hip-Hop (I am)

[Chorus]
We took it to the top from the bottom
Adversities, I fought 'em
They never said I'd get it and I got 'em
I am that kid, I am that soul
I am that boy they looking for, I am
I hustle, I grind, I push it, I shine
They know that (I am) that kid
(I am) Kells (I am) Hip-Hop (I am)

[VERSE 1]
Kells! I been that kid since day one
The temptations of this game, the greatest that they saw
They only hate what I've become & that's the motherfuckin truth
I spit the real until the wisdom's out my motherfuckin tooth
And who said I need a coupe? Man I push a hoopty
I'm still the same city boy just new loot
New paper trails and new shoes, new sharks and new pools
See I'm the modern times, you fools is old news
Run the city where the jack is out and every other day
Another motherfucker headed for the top
Came from the box in the bottom of the scene
For the bout to break out kells cover up then get shot
Can't forget about pops who held me down through all this
The sky's not the limit, all my stars in this bitch

[HOOK]
So rise (push) Rise (push it)
Grind (let's get it) Grind! (let's get it)
This is my life and I am what they wanna be
This is my fight

[CHORUS}
We took it to the top from the bottom
Adversities, I fought 'em
They never said I'd get it and I got 'em
I am that kid, I am that soul
I am that boy they looking for, I am
I hustle, I grind, I push it, I shine
They know that (I am) that kid
(I am) Kells (I am) Hip-Hop (I am)

[VERSE 2]
Cleveland is the city that we come from
Swear I can't lose with this one
Built Ford tough, call my seven fourty-fizive
M-G-K, the realEST rapper alizive
Fitted from the toes to the cranium
Five star swag from the block to the stadium
I put on my city like a fresh new tee
I'ma hold my dawgs down like a fresh new leash
I'm me, naw matter fact I am, sweeter than blackberry jam
You should already know I'm tweakin off this record
And peaking off the rector
My life is like an epic movie scene with no director

[HOOK]
So rise (push) Rise (push it)
Grind (let's get it) i said Grind! (let's get it)
This is my life and I am what they wanna be
This is my fight

[CHORUS}
We took it to the top from the bottom
Adversities, I fought 'em
They never said I'd get it and I got 'em
I am that kid, I am that soul
I am that boy they looking for, I am
I hustle, I grind, I push it, I shine
They know that (I am) that kid
(I am) Kells (I am) Hip-Hop (I am)

[VERSE 3]
Came from the bucket of chicken and lamb chops
Finger lickin' money made the truck rag-top
More style than a motherfuckin fag got
And the hottest thing cookin since the crackpot
I'm known for making a little bit of change work
Skinny boy known to make a big man hurt
They call me the big bad wolf, all about that green
No time for the little blue smurfs
What's got into these people, speaking my name
You speak what you see, I speak what I live
We are not speaking the same
You are the bitch in the man and I'm the man in a bitch
I'm the brains behind the hustle and the muscle on the strip
I get currency and you heard of me
Machine Gun will murder ??? ca-ca-care for more guap than Burger King
Swear to them I keep it trill until I d-i-e
This is real life for me, motherfuck TV

[HOOK]
So rise (push) i said Rise (push it)
Grind (let's get it) i said Grind! (let's get it)
This is my life and I am what they wanna be
This is my fight

[CHORUS}
We took it to the top from the bottom
Adversities, I fought 'em
They never said I'd get it and I got 'em
I am that kid, I am that soul
I am that boy they looking for, I am
I hustle, I grind, I push it, I shine
They know that (I am) that kid
(I am) Kells (I am) Hip-Hop (I am)
