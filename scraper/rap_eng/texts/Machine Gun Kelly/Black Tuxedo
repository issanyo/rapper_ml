[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uh, grilled cheese with no ham
Lookin at my life like God damn
I came from nothing no lie
Bitch, now I want a piece of that pie that's why it's

[HOOK]
All black tuxedos
All black tuxedos
No hand me down's no more it's just all black tuxedo's
All black tuxedos
All black tuxedos
I came from nothing no lie
Now it's all black tuxedos

(Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly)
Handshakes don't make friends boy
Laziness don't make rent boy
Shaker grad with no plans boy
Single dad with no ends boy
Now I only fuck 10's boy
Life's a movie no lens boy
Took it from the cement boy
And I still kept it Cleveland boy

[Verse 2: Tezo]
I come straight from the bottom just to get high at the top
I got all of the juice somebody grab me a mop
Real recognize real, look me dead in the eyes
Calamari and steak, no more burgers and fries
Cliquot keep me pissy, all my ex-hoes miss me
Black Benz, that big body I call that bitch Missy
Big bank take little bank, fuck what ya think
You don't grind you don't shine
You don't grind you don't shine, Tezo

[Hook]
[Machine Gun Kelly]
All black tuxedos
All my bitches wear speedos
[Tezo]
Mobbed up like Sonny
Wackin all of you weasels
[Machine Gun Kelly]
And I'm riding dirty, 4 wheels
Smoking something illegal
In the rear view is them people
But it's fuck the law we don't see em
[Tezo]
I like my weed real loud, champagne cold
I've been killin this shit since 17 years old
Used to turn on the lights I saw nothing but roaches
Now I turn on the lights I see Bentley's and Porsches, god damn

[HOOK]
[Outro]
Uh, grilled cheese with no ham
Lookin at my life like God damn
Uh, I came from nothing no lie
Bitch, now I want a piece of that pie that's why it's
All black tuxedo's...
