[Verse: Machine Gun Kelly]
In my hood money equals power
& in the world money controls everything we believe & I can see we're in are darkest hour
Cause It feels like the government is as crooked as the police
I spent the week catching up on the news
A girl committed suicide after she was bullied in school
Because some dudes told her she wasn't cool
& You would rather gossip about a famous person breakin' the rules
I'm confused
Tell me is my life's price worth the jewels
They tell me fight night, I'm supposed to loose
Just cause in high sight, They don't like my type
White Boy with some rythem & blues

[Outro: Machine Gun Kelly]
There's a line in there where I said "A girl committed suicide after she was bullied in school
Because some dudes told her she wasn't cool
& You would rather gossip about a famous person breakin' the rules
I'm confused"
And It really puts a lot of things in perspective with how we are in society right now
Cause we would rather talk about a famous person getting a DUI
As opposed to shedding light on how serious it is that there are boys & girls that are 15 years old, lost, don't have the sense of how to be a man or a woman yet hurting themselves
I was doing a meet & greet & this girl came up to me & asked if I could sign her arm
And I looked down & she had cut her wrist, I mean from about here were her elbow is to her palm
And it was just like gashes
So much pain & I signed my name over it, she took a picture of it & a year later she posted a picture of that same arm & there was no cuts, I mean there was no more pain & It was just scars that will probably never leave
But, It was a beautiful thing to see my voice influence a change like that
We're blinded by all this other bullshit that we don't even focus on the real problem
I mean, I wanna take people's eyes off of the celebrity & put it on the people deserving of our love & attention
