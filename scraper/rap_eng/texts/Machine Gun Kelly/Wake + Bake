[Hook]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Brush your teeth and light the J up
Bake, word
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Bake, bake
Bake

[Verse 1]
Veggie oil in the pan, god damn
Fry the chicken with the ham, yes ma'am
Butter biscuit with the jam
Twisting up another gram
Fuck, I'm late to work again

[Hook]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Brush your teeth and light the J up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

[Verse 2]
Ay, smoke me out, though
Got the homies on the couch
Rolling up an ounce right before I bounce (I get high)
Checking my accounts, ain't no fuckin' doubt
I spent the whole amount 'cause (I get high)
Shorty pissed I pulled off in the whip and drive
Supposed to hit the job, but (I get high)
Told my boss I quit 'cause I'm a boss and shit
Fuck this 9 to 5

[Hook]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Brush your teeth and light the J up
Bake
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Bake, bake
