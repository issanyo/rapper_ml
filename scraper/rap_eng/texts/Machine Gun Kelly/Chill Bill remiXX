[Hook: Tezo]
I be on it all day
Like Big Boi and Andre
Smoking on that kill bill
That shit keep me high for days
Treat a bitch like Postmates pull up
Paint her face then vacate
Spending money LA, California vacay

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ay, gold flakes on my steaks
Vodka in my Perrier
I don't have no table manners
I'm a savage every day
I don't cry but I smoke onions
I fuck bitches up at Runyon
My squad just bought machine guns
In case you haters up to something, boom
Woah, woah, dude wait
The crib looking like SoHo UK
Big budget finna ball like 2k
I got a boutique in my closet
Big booty bitch making me coffee
And the crib speakers only play vinyl
I got the Fugees killin' me softly
Gold chains on my dick
Feeling like 2Pac in this bitch
Feeling like Scarface in this tub
Feeling like Snoop Dogg smoking this nug
Tatted from the toes up looking like a thug
Eyes all red, got 'em looking like blood
Take a piss test, it'll look like drugs
If I take a piss test, it'll look like drugs

[Hook: Tezo]
I be on it all day
Like Big Boi and Andre
Smoking on that kill bill
That shit keep me high for days
Treat a bitch like Postmates pull up
Paint her face then vacate
Spending money LA, California vacay

[Verse 2: Tezo]
I got hoes in Venice
And that pussy water
I am from the land
Meet my nigga on water
I got hoes in Georgia
And that pussy gorgeous
I'm a fucking savage
Might slaughter your daughter
Ho, I'm God's son
I wanna be my father

[Verse 3: Dub-o]
I am on a higher level, cloud 9 and one
Holy moley, slow your rolly
I'm hot bitch, cut the fan on
I should put some Vans on
Make Dane tell me damn dog
Doobie stogies I be burning
I smell like I was burning
My bitch look like she could be Spanish
Every time we fuck I fuckin' vanish
Peter Pan Neverlanding
The heater man, blam the cannon
Bring it back like DJ Cannon
Save the drama, baby momma
Cause I am not the baby father
By the way I know he hate me probably
I'm just bending corners
Placing pickup orders
Banging at my door, yeah
It makes me grip the .40
I should drink a 40
I rather you ignore me
I'm just bending corners
Placing pickup orders

[Hook: Tezo]
I be on it all day
Like Big Boi and Andre
Smoking on that kill bill
That shit keep me high for days
Treat a bitch like Postmates pull up
Paint her face then vacate
Spending money LA, California vacay
