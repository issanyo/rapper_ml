[Couplet 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I don't gang bang, ho, I just gang bang these hoes
And I keep like eight J's rolled then I face 'em after my shows
And I got your main thing bro
On my dang-a-lang where she swang and hang like an orangoutang
But you don't really wanna follow me 'cuz every one of my boys bang-a-rang
Cocaine, cocaine, my skin white like cocaine
Marked up like them old trains but I keep it hood with this low main
Propane, propane, spark that shit like propane
On the Eastside is my domain and I kick more shit than Liu Kang
Hold on, shut up, who remembers my come up?
Who remembers my broke ass when I had no food for my stomach?
Who remembers my haters when I was keeping it G?
'Cuz I don't remember them bitches but them hoes remember me
Holla back, two phones, I don't call shit
Wild boy 'cuz I start shit, rager 'cuz I mosh pit
And this "a" stands for "anarchist"
My heart is Antarctic, burn one and get car sick
Floating like a carpet bitch I'm higher than the starship
Tatted up so I can't work, you would think I got paid first
Beat that pussy out the frame, you would think that bitch gave birth
All these sins, you would think that I hate church
Said "Thou shalt not steal", but fuck that, I'll take her

[Refrain: Machine Gun Kelly]
Hold on, shut up, who remembers my come up?
Who remembers my broke ass when I had no food for my stomach?
Who remembers my haters when I was keeping it G?
'Cuz I don't remember them bitches but them hoes remember me
Now hold on, shut up, hold on, shut up
Hold on, shut up, hold on, shut up
Yeah, who remembers my haters when I was keeping it G?
'Cuz I don't remember them bitches but them hoes remember me

[Couplet 2: Young Jeezy]
I don't remember these hoes, I don't remember these niggas
Fuck niggas, bitches too, all I see is these figures
I got Versace on, Versace lights, I ain't seeing these niggas
Chances here, chances are three on three with these niggas
Look all bark, no bite, all rap, no white
You are her friends you are my friends and we can be friends well alright
Machine Gun, we got one, machine gun I got one
See me, I'm a real nigga, he probably mad at me 'cuz he's not one
Straight chopper music, no bite, 18 door nigga snow white
You can bet a nigga if I said it nigga ten out of ten is no right
Tell me what's not to love, why hate?
I want a real answer nigga, I'll wait
Check my 'Rari like I'm in a roader derby put my shoes on and I skate
He don't like me nigga don't me nigga inside to me that's hate
Say he wanna rap about it wanna talk don't live it nigga that's fake
Say it's coming back and it's locking up sounds like to me that's flake
Say you don't rock with me don't fuck with me that's great
Hold up !

[Refrain]
