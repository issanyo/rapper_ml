My squad, big boys
The fuck you makin' over there, big noise
A lot of mouths shut when I come round so when you hear the bass hit the fuckin' ground
Like, big bass bitch, uh
Yeah, big bass bitch, go
(Machine Gun Kelly)
Please don't try and match my game
This isn't the lottery you can't scratch my name
Fuck all that internet bullshit, thinkin' they tough because they hack domains
Man this is the streets where they sell crack cocaine
Not what in the fuck you thought
It's winter time, tell these rappers that it's Springer time
Cause I be eating my competition like it's dinner time
Fuck your salad, you're dead meat son
I gotta 99 problems and beef ain't one
I'm the reason why you're neighbors don't come out no more
I am the reason that you cannot find your spouse no more
I'm the reason winter time came early this year
Go in the house and cover up, I'm cold hearted b-burr
B-burr, I'm cold bitch burr
But I'm the hottest thing around let me burn bitch burn
This ain't legal, still I ain't cuffed
You got a problem take it up with my trunk
Big bass, shit

My squad, big boys
The fuck you makin' over there, big noise
A lot of mouths shut when I come round so when you hear the bass hit the fuckin' ground
Like, big bass bitch, uh
Yeah, big bass bitch, go

Now fuck what you read in that blog, cause you talkin' that bullshit but wait till I see you
I dare you to step to my face and to say the same thing that you said from your PC
Never no nonsense
I take it to levels don't matter my conscious
I'm bringin' the sharpest
You don't wanna see if you walk in the dark

That everything that you said just motivates me to ????
And if I could do it again and again I would do it, I'm leavin' it flawless
Ever since I was a kid I been like this American creature regardless
So all of my haters decide to just stay at my doorstep receiving my garbage
Bitch, fuck you
We don't know that fake shit, seems we hardest
Provide for the future of soldiers ahead of us, the army
We ready for war so you better be ready to be at this battle that's started
I'm bringin' my heaviest weapon
This big bass, bitch

My squad, big boys
The fuck you makin' over there, big noise
A lot of mouths shut when I come round so when you hear the bass hit the fuckin' ground
Like, big bass bitch, uh
Yeah, big bass bitch, go
