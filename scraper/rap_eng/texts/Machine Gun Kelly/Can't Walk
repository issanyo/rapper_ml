[Chorus]
Y'all can't see my eyes behind these shades
Y'all can't see my eyes behind these shades
I been fucked up for the last two days straight
I been fucked up for the last two days, dog
And I can't walk
Got me off of my shit man

[Verse 1]
I can't lie, dog, I'm so fried, dog
I'm so high, dog, this is my life
One night I'ma get it done
Can't stop 'til I see the sun
One bite, hit the drugs
Can't die, I'm too young
I feel just like Jimi back at Woodstock
What did you just give me in this Ziploc?
Blurred lines, blurred lines, I just fucked for the third time
Purple rain, purple rain fell in my cup, slurred rhymes

[Chorus]
Y'all can't see my eyes behind these shades
Y'all can't see my eyes behind these shades
I been fucked up for the last two days straight
I been fucked up for the last two days, dog
And I can't walk, and I can't walk
I can't walk, and I can't walk
I can't walk

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you a little somethin' 'bout me
I'ma finish what you getting started
So don't be fighting at my fucking party
'Cause I'ma fuck you up
Bitch thought of my crew, though
Don't blow my crew, though
Make room for the crew, though
I got girls in the front, huh
2 grams in the blunt, huh
Rolling up that funk, huh
I feel just like Ozzy back in '8-5
My girl's just want sloppy ice cream paint jobs
I served it up, I served it up
It's the young gun, you heard of us
I just got in three fights
So I ain't slept for three nights

[Chorus]
Y'all can't see my eyes behind these shades
Y'all can't see my eyes behind these shades
I been fucked up for the last two days straight
I been fucked up for the last two days, dog
And I can't walk, and I can't walk
I can't walk, and I can't walk
I can't walk
