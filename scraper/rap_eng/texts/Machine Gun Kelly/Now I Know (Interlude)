[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly]
This weed got a motherfucker thinkin’ too much
But since they already wanna think for me... fuck it

[Hook]
Now I know, Now I know, Now I know
Now I know, Now I know, Now I know

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, now is it just me or is this shit crazy?
I mean we still nobodies but damn
Come up from where we from?
Who would’ve thought we’d be this famous?
Critics hate us, promoters played us
Rappers copy what I’ve created
Signed to a major, that ain’t change shit
One year later, bitch I made it
Out the basement, out of all them shitty ass jobs
In the kitchen with the nametag apron
From homeless to a hometown favorite
Broke every stereotype, I got named with
So mother fuck the world with a nase did
So I bust these bars cuz they caged us
Never trust the lords cuz they flagrant
Whips and chains cuz I’ve been affidavit
Suits and ties and courtroom’s for arraignment
Hugs and tears for the jailtime facin'
Pour some beers on the pavement, black rags hangin’
Lettin’ the world know we bangin’
EST is what I’m claimin’
EST is for life baby
Two fingers up till the world lace up
And if you ain’t say it now what the fuck you sayin'?

[Hook]

How can you judge someone you’ve never known?
Speak on where they're from and you've never gone
Man I did dirt in this city,gave birth in this city
How the fuck can I not call this home?
I did my best work in this city
Seen some of the best get merked in this city
And although I love it's crap in a bucket
Gotta keep heat like sweatshirts up in this city
Because it’s a cold world when you hot shit
People keep sayin’ you changed even though you the same
But now you just got shit
But I can do without the fame
Because it was fuck you then they loved you
And everyone want pictures of you
Then family members start thinkin’ you paid and
All of a sudden this faker' your uncle
Radio stations want somethin' for nothing
The bloggers let politics get to their head
I’m one of the best, but they part of the trend
It’s not how you flow with your clothes instead
Man I am a prodigy, fuck an apology
I am who I am accepted or not
I throw my L up cuz even when I'm down
These two fingers right here is all that I got

[Hook]
