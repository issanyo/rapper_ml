[Intro]
Yeah
Can we please start over, now that we're both sober?
Even though that won't last long
I swear this love is a sad song
I spend my nights at the strip club
I pay them girls just to get love
I pay them to lie to me
One of them girls gave her line to me
I spent my night at the strip club
I pay them girls just to get love
I pay them to lie to me
Girl I can't even lie

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you see when you look at me?
Don't cover my scars, let them bleed
Tell me, is this how we're supposed to be?
Well then I'm so, I'm so happy

[Chorus]
And we don't need rehab
We don't need rehab
We don't need rehab
We don't need rehab
We don't need rehab

[Verse]
Would you be happy if I let you go?
Even if the highs feel low
Even if you couldn't sleep because you couldn't feel me underneath the covers when your eyes closed
I'm gettin' faded 'cause our love is fading
If I'm a monster then it's 'cause you made 'im
Beauty and the beast, now that's an ultimatum
Go with what you love, or follow what is gonna save you
Woah, I think we went somewhere we shouldn't go
Maybe it was Vodka, maybe it was blow
Maybe it was nothin', maybe it was both
Maybe it was the secrets I ain't want you to know
Maybe I wasn't leavin', maybe you made me go
Maybe there was a reason for our behavior tho
Maybe it was the pills or the house on the hills
Maybe it was the thrills, baby this love kills

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you see when you look at me?
Don't cover my scars, let them bleed
Tell me, is this how we're supposed to be?
Well then I'm so, I'm so happy

[Chorus]
And we don't need rehab
We don't need rehab
We don't need rehab
We don't need rehab
We don't need rehab

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you see when you look at me?
Don't cover my scars, let them bleed
Tell me, is this how we're supposed to be?
Well then I'm so, I'm so happy

[Chorus]
And we don't need rehab
We don't need rehab
We don't need rehab
We don't need rehab
We don't need rehab
