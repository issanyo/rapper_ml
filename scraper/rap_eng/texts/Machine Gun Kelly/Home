[Chorus: Sam Harris & Bebe Rexha]
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, I didn't power through the struggle
Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
All these miles, feet, inches
They can't add up to the distance
That I have been through, just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe
I still ache from trying to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign, I'm starting to lose faith

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Harris & Machine Gun Kelly]
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I'm trying to find

[Chorus: Sam Harris + Bebe Rexha & Machine Gun Kelly]
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
It's been a long time coming
Someone take me

[Post-Chorus: Sam Harris & Bebe Rexha]
Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Home, home
Someone take me
Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Home, home

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, I've been through so much pain
And it's hard to maintain, any smile on my face
'Cause there's madness on my brain
So I gotta make it back, but my home ain't on the map
Gotta follow what I'm feeling to discover where it's at
I need the (memory)
In case this fate is forever, just to be sure these last days are better
And if I have any (enemies)
To give me the strength to look the devil in the face and make it home safe

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Harris & Machine Gun Kelly]
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I'm trying to find

[Chorus: Sam Harris + Bebe Rexha]
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha + Sam Harris]
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone

[Post-Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly, Sam Harris & Bebe Rexha]
Someone take me
Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Take me home
Home, home (take me home)
Someone take me
Home, ho-o-o-o-me (someone, someone)
Nothing here feels like home
Home, home
Someone take me
