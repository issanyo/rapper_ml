[Verse 1]
Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight
I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head, she sang
Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow how you wanted it to be
And over my head, out of her head she sang

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder when I sing along with you

[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

[Verse 2]
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know you've always been
And out of your head, out of my head I sang

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder when I sing along with you

[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

[Instrumental Break with whispering voices]

[Bridge]
And I wonder...

[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
