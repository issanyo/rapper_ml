Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
I’m a wild boy, fuck an eighth I need O's
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
Yea bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
I’m a wild boy, I’ma I'mma wild boy
I’m a wild boy, fuck an eighth I need O's
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
I’m a wild boy, I’ma I'mma wild boy
I’m a wild boy, fuck an eighth I need O's

[Verse 1 - Corny]
Uh, I'm a wild boy and its obvious, not Steve-O but Chris Pontius
I Party Boy, I'm the raunchiest. I got a unique flow and a long penis
And I'd love to see it on the lips of any downright naughty bitch
Who's dirtier than my laundry is and will make it fast like Ghandi did
All I know is liquor got me feeling like the man
Maybe cuz I am, maybe cuz I can spit it on a level that you wouldn't understand
Can't afford an ounce so I went and bought a gram
Smoked it with your bitch and she took it like a champ
I'm talking bout my dick, I ain't talking bout the plant
She can handle dick and cannabis at the same time and I'm a fan of it
She's a fan of Chris, so the feelings mutual
But I don't even like her, I just find her useful
Her dick sucking skills have earned my approval
But if she falls in love, I'll need bitch removal
So I can go back to my business as usual
Just kill every beat and stay forever youthful
I can find a new bitch to blow my bugle
And she'll probably be better if I'm being truthful...
You will  never be where I am currently
Burning purple tree, not earning currency
Sipping on liquor until its hurting me
All the bad bitches want to have a turn with me
Sharing me like a child toy
So fuckin insane, I'm a wild boy
To understand me you'd have to put on my shoes and walk a thousand miles boy

[Hook - MGK]

[Verse 2 - Corny]
I've said it before, but I'll say it again, I'm bout that wild boy lifestyle until the end
Always stay sipping on a pint of gin
And roll with a clique full of wild men
Don't you fucking get it? we are not the same
I'm crazy boy, I'm fucking insane
Smoking on an ounce of finest strains
And by the time I'm through with it I'll be losing my brain
Losing my mind, all I do is grind
What the fuck you mean "I'm wasting my time?"
Can't you fucking hear it I'm on point with the rhymes
If I didn't fucking spit it would be a crime
So accurate I'm so precise
Wild boys never have sober nights
Unknown despite my flow is nice
But its better underrated than overhyped
What's the point of a buzz if you lack the talent?
I've been discounted overlooked and doubted
But I don't really mind its just another challenge
Stay up late nights like Jimmy Fallon
Fuck an eighth I need an ounce and
Fuck a fifth I'll drink a gallon
That's wild boy but I'm about it
Take so many shots, that I stop counting
YEAAAAAAAH
I'm wild boy, you better believe it
YEAAAAAAAH
I've got a goal and I'm gonna achieve it
Now I got the skill so all I need is
The recognition that your receiving
I'll intercept it, then I'll keep it, got this shit on lock like Darrelle Revis
Yea bitch, yea bitch call me Revis
Yea bitch, yea bitch call me Revis
I got it locked down, got it, got it locked down
I got it locked down, I bet you wanna be Chris!
