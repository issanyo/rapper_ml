[Verse 1: Jacoby Shaddix]
I was young and I was reckless man
Moved out at seventeen and made my momma mad
I thought I had it all figured out
A pocket full of pills and a forty in my mouth
Peeled out in my big black Chevy
Flipped it six times and I knew that I was ready
To straighten up because my best friend died
I didn't wanna carry on living that life

[Chorus: Jacoby Shaddix]
And now I'm running from the scene
'cause I was caught up in the crime
It's a loaded memory
Yeah, it kills me every time
And I'm trying not to scream but it's eating me alive
I'm still haunted by the best years of
The best years of my life

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah, lemme take y'all back
I was young and I was helpless man
Self medicating my own depression man
I drank a bottle after breakfast
Took a look in the mirror ripped the rosary off my necklace
Damn
I lost my job so I lost faith
I just saw a baby bump in my girl's waist
I need a drink to feel right
Party with my homies to escape from real life
Yeah, we had it all figured out
A pocket full of pills and a forty in my mouth
But, I never should've let my best friend drive
'cause he's the reason my child will never see me alive
Damn!

[Chorus: Jacoby Shaddix]
Now I'm running from the scene
'cause I was caught up in the crime
It's a loaded memory
Yeah, it kills me every time
And I'm trying not to scream but it's eating me alive
I'm still haunted by the best years of
The best years of my life

[Verse 3: Jacoby Shaddix]
All of a sudden nothing matters anymore
He lost it all, his life was scattered on the floor
And now his family's tryna pick up all the pieces
I am locked up in a box, I am a monster
I'm the reason that he's gone
Wish I could take it all back
Press rewind and take a picture of the past
Pause it, feel my heart turn black
My lungs are smoldering, I'm breathing in the ash

[Chorus: Jacoby Shaddix]
Now I'm running from the scene
'cause I was caught up in the crime
It's a loaded memory
Yeah, it kills me every time
And I'm trying not to scream but it's eating me alive
I'm still haunted by the best years of
The best years of my life

I'm still haunted by the best years of
The best years of my life
I'm still haunted by the best years of
