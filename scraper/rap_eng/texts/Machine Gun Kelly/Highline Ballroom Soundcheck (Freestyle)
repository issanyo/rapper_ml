[Verse]
Ayo, first off my name is
Fuck that, check the playlist
Bitch I'm tryna blow up like the Al Qaedas
But why y'all wanna be famous?
So I can pay for protection and pretend to be gangsta?
These rappers is five foot tall talkin' 'bout gang-bangin'
I'm 6'3'', I pee make 'em yellow like Coldplay is
Six deep up in the rental Honda from Avis
Bad bitches give me brain that explains the mindless behavior
But fuck 'em and never mind 'em like a hater
This rap shit is wack I'm goin' back to gettin' paid under the table
This industry turns me off like I forgot to pay my cable
A bunch of males on these labels tryna stick it in my anal (what the fuck?)
So I fuck these girls cause their rear-ended
I said motherfuck the world 'cause it's near-ended
And if you're scared go to church
Other than that go get a shirt with my name on it
Get your peers offended
You're tormented by my face, huh? Yeah
That makes you think of what you ain't, huh? Yeah
So shimmy shimmy yah shimmy yay
Get your old dirty ass out the way
Hold up, (ring)
Kells, Kells, it's XXL
We've got some wonderful news and I just wanted to tell
Now I know you and our freshman issue don't sit well
So we said fuck everyone else, gave you the cover to yourself
I ain't ballin' but I'm at the free throw
Didn't go to college, but I know this gringo is copied more than a fuckin' Kinkos
Mijo, mis amigos will cut you into burritos
And feed you to the seagulls, your career's over, finito (Fatality)
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch call me Steve-O
I'm a jackass, I'll backhand my country's presidito
I don't take part in politics
Where I'm from we call it deep-throat
I'd rather fuck me a bitch and X-Men like Magneto
Call me an asshole but be tactical
Because the wrong vernacular could turn something spectacular to a massacre
Microphone damager, Midwest assassiner
A Cleveland cannibal, able to eat any of you faggots like bananas
My cabinets are full of plants that make my lungs blacker than Janet
High as intergalactic planets, I think I work for NASA
My Chucks are classic, body marked up like my manager's calendar
Fans are fanatical still I'm slept on like these mattresses
Wake up, can you see me? Somebody get binoculars
I'm on top of a mammoth slappin' two animal activists
Livin' up to the standards I got stuck with as a rapper
A havoc, problematic, psychopathic, bastard, ambassador
(Cough, cough) hotboxin' an Acura
Pants saggin' gettin' head from Tabatha
Bitch I be that skinny motherfucker
Cleveland's what I'm reppin''
They already know the answer
Ain't no motherfuckin' question, it's Kells
I got more bars than a jail
I got more heat than the sun itself
You would think I was a member of Hell
You would think I didn't have any manners the way I use this Biggie beat for myself
But if anyone of you got a problem than let me call P.Diddy up on the cell and we'll tell you:
[The Notorious B.I.G. Sample]
Fuck the world it don't ask me for shit! (all you industry bitches can suck my dick)
Fuck the world it don't ask me for shit (I said all you industry bitches can suck my dick, bitch)
