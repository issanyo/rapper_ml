[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Okay I came in, no clout, small bank and my big mouth
Small name but these big shots Know just what this kids ’bout
I said shit, then I meant shit, coroner (I dead shit!)
I treat hoes, just like hoes, that throw bones, go fetch it
I'm pitbull, that ‘X’ shit, that going in at they neck shit
That ‘we gonna have a problem if I am not on they next shit’
‘Cause I wreck shit, can't tame me; I'm Eminem and I'm Jay-Z
I'm the renegade of this rap shit, me and all my boys like A Team
Fuck’s wrong with y’all? This is my warning shot I better see you get ghost
Because I'll treat competition like hoes: skip conversation and come at they throats
Boy I'm from the C-L-E-V-E-L-A-N-D and I will be reppin' that until I die
And you either with me or riding against me so let me know
Put them L’s up in the sky, lace up!

Call me the man, better yet, call me the kid (Uh)
Cause ain't nobody this young done what I did (No)
Cause ain't nobody this young gone through the shit that I went through these past couple years and lived (Woop)
Y'all suckers; hickey shit
I'm a real rockstar; Nikki Sixx
I'm Minaj and y'all just watch
God damn y'all Nikki's bitch
Can the game get any more corny? (Huh?)
Can the fame get any more boring? (Uh)
Can any other lame who think I'm dope put out garbage and make it easy for me
Is it possible for anyone to ignore me? (No)
Is it possible for anyone to record me?
So I cannot trust other people who capture closed video songs and put them out before me (Ha!)
And is it possible that I possibly delivered the illest lyrics?
Somebody call the paramedics! (Ahhhhh)
Somebody call the fucking paramedics!
Is it even possible with a lack of academics to get the credit in the city and never spend a minute in the class?
Fuck that, kiss my ass
Straight till it's pitch black
Roll it up and let me hit it
