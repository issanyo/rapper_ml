Verse 1:
Out the middle of the map we be givin it from the top
And we're done with the bottom of the class - What we call home
Everybody wanna know if the kid got a story
All folks gimme just a little when I give more
Started out with a smidgen of a midget
Now tell me where my competition?
Givin' 'em all, givin' 'em all, givin' 'em all, the SHOTS
??? subliminals and criminals we don't get CAUGHT!

Hook:
Tell me who gon' ride until the midwest rise
Who's heart's gonna stop when the midwest dies
Who's gonna take the spark from out these midwest eyes
And believe I ain't gon' stop until the midwest mine

Verse 2:
Yeah, yeah, everybody wanna hear the fast flow
Comin' out the C-L-E-V-E-L-A-N-D you better be rippin' the track though
You better be bounce like, you better be ???
If your word twisted like strings of a lasso
(Go get it boy) take it to the top of the terminal til' my last chance
They can't determine now why there ain't no stopping
Now we breaking out through all the cracks of the cowers
Cause Benny showers in the pockets of my Eddie Bauers'
I-I am that, kid that be sitting on the front porch
Clutched to the blunt roach
Taking it to the head with one toke
If only my problems could be solved with one smoke
And is the economy so messed up?
I already know I'm not gonna get the job
So what's the point in gettin' dressed up?
And I done seen my share
Fresh outta high school, lost two of mine out there
That's why ??? think twice
People that said "them Hollywood acts come around here"
This the Concrete Jungle, constant trouble
Always high but never humble
Livin' out this cartoon but we surrounded by rocks like Barney Rubble
Gangs and violence, pimps and hoes
Crack, wet, brick, zones
Jackers, rappers, trappers, bums
Block, 'jects, 'burbs, slums
Chopper, Glock, Mac, Uzi
This real, that's movie
Fights, cops, snitch, fans
This is midwest
Been around the world, seen a lot of things
Seem like I'm attached to the ghetto like a wedding ring
Never didn't like her, never did wife her
'Til she got me 0-1 in the circle like a cypher
Oh my god, please applaud
I ain't going home BITCH i go hard
Only white boy with a style so raw
Real recognize me, not you, you suck (YUH)

Hook:
Tell me who gon' ride until the midwest rise
Who's heart's gonna stop when the midwest dies
Who's gonna take the spark from out these midwest eyes
And believe I ain't gon' stop until the midwest mine
