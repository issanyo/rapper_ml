[Chorus: James Arthur]
You could get high or you could get low
You could stay young or you could grow old
Let it go (Oooh)
'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke
You could go hard or you could go home
You could live life or you could just fold
Let it go (Oooh)
'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, I started with a dollar and a dream, right
So I can show these people how to dream, right
I could show 'em how to aim for the stars
And take it to the arenas from the street lights
Damn, oh this is what the top feels like? (Whoa)
I still remember Ramen noodle meal nights
I still remember checkin' my account
And having 26 dollars when I signed my record deal nights
And I remember being cold
In my apartment, used the heater from the kitchen stove
Highs and Lows, that's how it goes
So I gotta roll somethin' up
Just to cope with the pressures of growin' up, man

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
What a week
We made it to the bar 'cause we need to heal up
You gotta play for keeps
'Cause Aces tend to stay with dealers
You got to believe it
But I'm a sinner too so I ain't preachin'
Just keep on dreamin'
'Cause all the bad days come for good reasons

[Chorus: James Arthur]
You could get high or you could get low
You could stay young or you could grow old
Let it go (Oooh)
'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke
You could go hard or you could go home
You could live life or you could just fold
Let it go (Oooh)
'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah, and if I had a dollar
For everytime they told me what I wouldn't be
I would be a rich man with a crib on a big hill (for real)
But I gotta work to get paid
Earn my own way
Work the third shift, burn the whole spliff
Since birth I've been... (Hold up, let me get it)
Look, failure was not an option, I gotta be at the top
Like I'm sorry, but I don't really feel sorry for y'all
I'm sorry I got a new number that you can't call
I'm sorry to everyone who still wants me to fall
Hold up, you know what, I ain't sorry at all

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
So I, hope that it was worth it when you searching
And you find what glitters ain't gold
And I, knew I wasn't perfect but I know that I made it all on my own

[Chorus: James Arthur]
You could get high or you could get low
You could stay young or you could grow old
Let it go (Oooh)
'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke
You could go hard or you could go home
You could live life or you could just fold
Let it go (Oooh)
'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke

[Bridge: James Arthur]
Paid my dues, so I'll see you later
Life is much more than paper
So I let it go, I just hit the road, I just let it go
Yeah, paid my dues so I see you later
Life is much more than paper
So let it go, I just hit the road, I just let it go

[Chorus: James Arthur]
You could get high or you could get low
You could stay young or you could grow old
Let it go (Oooh)
'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke
You could go hard or you could go home
You could live life or you could just fold
Let it go (Oooh)
'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke
