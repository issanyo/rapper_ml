[Intro]
{*New message*}
Ay, wassup man
I'm calling to let you know, bro
That, err, I don't know how long it's gon' be man
But, err, ya boy wants to do jail time
But you know, going around Shakers, we ain't kids no more
Still doing the same shit
March 30th is when I turn myself in and go to jail, man
Till then, keep making them hits, nigga foreal
You my best friend, my nigga, you saved me too, in college nigga now, foreal
Throw your hands up, my nigga, the industry 'bout to gain one of the best, ya know
They can't do it on their own
Aight, I'm going

[Verse 1]
It’s just the, trials and tribulations
This world is fucking crazy
When I’m screaming “free my man!”, the crowd’s screaming “congratulations!”
Cause we came from couches, to family houses, to corporations
And I know these streets are a dead end, but these streets embraced me
People I fuck with call me 'Kells', that’s what the streets named me
Fuck where you think I’m from or how I live, the streets raised me
And fuck the world for hitting my girl with that stray
And letting tears roll down my face onto her casket at the wake then
And I'm thankful for living this long, cause a lot of us don't make it
R-I-P to homie Rock who got shot after graduation
And Jo Jo was an animal, I guess that’s why they caged him
Caught in a vicious cycle of life as a young teenager
My history class is bullshit, they feed us false information
Fuck the founding fathers, millions died over Benjamin Franklin
My brother fought in Iraq, but it might as well been prison
Cause he’s home but his sanity ain't come with him
Fuck the world, screaming -

[Hook]
I pledge allegiance, to the streets
Hold me down, keep it G
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
That’s why I'm still standing in my Chuck T’s
My Chuck T's, In my Chuck T's
I’m standing strong, in my chuck T’s
I pledge allegiance, to the fans
To be the realest muthafucker that I can
That I can, that I can
Remain the realest muthafucker, that I can
Yeah, so when they lay me down to sleep
The last of a dying breed
R-I-P

[Verse 2]
Jesus died for me, government lied to me
These people say they loyal, I just hope they ride for me
And if I die before I wake then cry for me
And keep my muthafucking name alive for me
Look, I done seen some things that I would never tell my daughter
And did some shit that I'm ashamed of to get her what I got her
I know the Devil’s hot, but I got something hotter
And they ain't from Jamaica, but my boys are fucking Shottas
We never start no fights, but we'll go to war
EST tatted on us, that’s something we'll die for
These faggots had shit handed to them, but we earned it
Roll a J, yell out my window "Lace The Fuck Up!" then I burn it
Turned into the opposite of what they thought I would, skipping classes
Voice of a revolution of troubled youth, kiss our asses
And if government conspiracy's a lie
Then why the dollar got the all seeing eye?
Fuck this world, screaming -

[Hook]
