[Chorus: Lorine Chia]
Don't fight what you're feeling now
It's only right
We're gonna have one hell of a night
Don't deny what you're feeling inside
Just relax have a good time

[Verse 1: Lorine Chia]
Take this time with me
Let's go out to see
What the night wants us to be
Let's break out and be free
So many places to go
I wanna go where the wind will blow
Let go of all you're thinking of
And let the magic of the night unfold

[Chorus: Lorine Chia]

[And have a good time](x4)

[Bridge: Lorine Chia]
Put your hands up in the air
And have a good time
Wave em like you just don't care
And have a good time
Take a round with all your friends
And have a good time
Feeling like this never ends
And have a good time

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
And they say
Girls ain't nothing but trouble
But I say
Go ahead and bring me a double
Courvoisier
You already know what we up to
I'm trying to change the world with one drink mufucka
Uh
East side for life
I'm bringing up my hood
You're right
Hit 120 in the fast lane
But with G double Od Good on the turnpike
Yeah now bounce like it's your night (uh)
Bounce, bounce like it's your night
Living like were gonna die today
One hit of me take the pain away
And we come through like angels say
Praise god
My thought so hard I could fade away
And in this game it's safe to say
Stay real keep the fake away
That's how I play
Kells

[Chorus: Lorine Chia]

[And have a good time](x4)

[Bridge: Lorine Chia]

[And have a good time]
