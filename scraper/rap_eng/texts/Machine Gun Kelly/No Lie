CHORUS
It's no lie that I make what you want in one day
Go to sleep and I pray then wake up and got paid
So hello to money, all of the ???
It's no lie that I am who they all wanna be
It's no lie, it's no lie, it's no lie, it's no lie
It's no lie, it's no lie, it's no lie, it's no lie
It's no lie, that, that I'm, it's no lie, that, that I'm
It's no lie, that, that I'm, I'm, I'm...

VERSE 1
And I'm that boy
From the city where they gotta lock my doors
Something evil coming out of my floors
Swear monsters creeping out of my drawers
???
No lie no I ain't rapping
But I'm in the hood so I wear street fashion
Parents mad my pants is saggin'
Laughing, haha, all the way to the bank I'm dashing
Call me the RoadRunner
My whole squad Looney, where's Bugs & Daffy
Strapped to dough like Laffy Taffy
Make me a trademark like Acme
I'm in the outer atmosphere
??? no airplane crashes
25,000 miles per hour, I'm out
And 25,000 dollars that's what's coming out of my mouth
And I grind, I don't skateboard nothing
I rock my Chucks and watch how I turn Superbad like McLovin
It's nothing

CHORUS
It's no lie that I make what you want in one day
Go to sleep and I pray then wake up and got paid
So hello to money, all of the ???
It's no lie that I am who they all wanna be
It's no lie, it's no lie, it's no lie, it's no lie
It's no lie, it's no lie, it's no lie, it's no lie
It's no lie, that, that I'm, it's no lie, that, that I'm
It's no lie, that, that I'm, I'm, I'm...

VERSE 2
Garage full of cars with the radar for the laws
And the X-rays for the broads
No telescope, we the stars
Yeah, yeah, sittin on a million but I ain't got it yet
Hey, hey papers for the ??? like private jets
Got friends from the ???
Suited up rockin' ???
Ain't no green from this side of the fence
So we drop the bills picked up the personal checks
Yes, show 'em where the loot at
Matter fact, show them where the recruit at
Billionaire's Boy's Club, I'm the newest
God bless ??? I'm the truest
Come on, I got a net worth larger than the average American citizen
Focused on my money, hand me forms and send em in
???
Only medicine that a guy like me needs is that qwap and no lie
Will be the one to cross the finish for the spinach and I am that guy

CHORUS
It's no lie that I make what you want in one day
Go to sleep and I pray then wake up and got paid
So hello to money, all of the ???
It's no lie that I am who they all wanna be
It's no lie, it's no lie, it's no lie, it's no lie
It's no lie, it's no lie, it's no lie, it's no lie
It's no lie, that, that I'm, it's no lie, that, that I'm
It's no lie, that, that I'm, I'm, I'm...
