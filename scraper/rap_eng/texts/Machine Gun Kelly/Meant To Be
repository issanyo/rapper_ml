[Verse 1]
I wrote this on a plane, so high cause the ground is so insane
Spent my life inside a bed because the world is too mundane
Now I'm doing everything I shouldn't to sustain
And muthafuck a 9 to 5, look I will never work that shift again
2/11/2010 is where that story ends
And this ain't science fiction, welcome to this chapter in my life
But it's gone be awhile, please enjoy the flight
Lace Up! Kells!

[Hook]
And if this wasn't meant to be and all my dreams die in loving memory
You can take me with'em cause I ain't going home and I ain't waking up
Living this dream is all I know
And if they want me dead, they better raise those prices on my head cause I said that I'd be famous
Now look at me, I made it. So when they say name they gone put up me with the greatest

[Verse 2]
And Tony told me that this world was mine
So I took that shit up off the shelf and skipped the line
I ain't payin for what's due. Man, I'm taking what I've earned
They say Kells is on fire, let that muthafucka burn
Tell my team we got next. EST until the muthafuckin death
I am my brothers keeper
I ain't sellin them, not for a check
Cause a buck couldn't make me give a fuck about my brother
Matter fact being broke's what made me love my brother
Yelling East side, East side, mighty, mighty East side and I'll be there for life like 3 strikes
Couldn't take me away for shit but they say this where you'll be killed mufucka
That's fine, just make sure I die a real mufucka

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And if you got a dream, don't be scared to fall. You won't hit the ground, cause we above it all
Tell'em dim the lights, we just wanna shine
So they could see me starred and I could get what's mine

And if you got a dream, don't be scared to fall. You won't hit the ground, cause we above it all
Tell'em dim the lights, we just wanna shine. Praying that tomorrow won't rewind
