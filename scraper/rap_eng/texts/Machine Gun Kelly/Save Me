[Verse: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uh, from the bottom of the ash I rose
Yeah, to the top I go
Where I’m from its cold
But I don’t need this coat (nah)
Keep my sleeves rolled
Got my city’s area code on my shoulder (whattup)
216 forever in my soul
Swear to God every single night its gets colder
No heat so we all around that stove
Like “fuck this broke shit,” petty ass hustlin
Couldn’t even sell one zone
Slim still workin' at the store and the only time we ever get to eat is when he brings something home
Everydays dark here
Prayin for a rainbow to lead us to that pot of gold
And exchange those nights on a concrete floor
For a bottle of Rose to pop that bitch off like we suppose to
Never gave a fuck if we went gold
I just wanna be able to say that "I made it"
Cause’ real EST mufuckas don’t fold
Real EST mufuckas don't break up, real family grows old
Real EST mufuckers representin' for the city where they came even when they gone
And fuck this throne, ain't no kings
No pretty princess, ain't no queen
No fairy tale endings on the eastside
Just these broken homes and those screams
Broken bones underneath these jeans
Broken bricks cover up my streets
Fiends outside trying to get they fix
While my first born in here trying to get sleep
Muthafuck this rap shit
Try buryin' your boy six feet, let me show you 'bout real
Try telling me that you can’t make it up out the city 26 dollars to multi-mills
Face inside of the XXL
Then try coming back to the eastside still
Well bitch I did, and it's still the kid
Labeled a Bad Boy before this deal
What up Slim, Dub, Xplo, Dre, Swirv, Ash, my boy BK
And everybody from the beginning that bled with me knowing I would be here one day
So as I roll through all the hoods that raised me
Lookin' at the house of pain
I’ma runaway from the ones that pay me
Hopin I’ll stay the same

[Outro: M. Shadows]
Can't you save meeeeeeee?
[Can't you save meeeeeeee?]
[Can't you save meeeeeeee?]
[Can't you save meeeeeeee?]
