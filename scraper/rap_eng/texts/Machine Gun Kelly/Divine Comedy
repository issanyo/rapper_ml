[Intro: IIO]
I never knew a love
A love that could be sweeter
No matter what my mind says
Your music gives me feelin

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
(Damn) can anybody give me a sound
The sky’s too quiet, somebody show me the ground
Coz I’m blinded by the clouds
Precipitations too heavy I won’t bow (down)
Back to the lab, crowds remove my crown, flood my town
Seas of free people drowning
If I see black cats then I take grey hounds
(Damn) where ever my eye brows frown
I never knew that love until I started to count
Shining with the stars in the spacious lounge
But I Divorce the ball so I'm on the rebound
Shame a woman’s best friend is a man first child
Coz my weakness for a smile, just reinstated my vows
Matrimony got us walking up the aisle
Me and my guidance agree
In love with the lifestyles

[Hook: IIO & Machine Gun Kelly ]
(I never knew a love)
I never knew a love like this
Power enamblin me, to flourish in my sins
(A love that could be sweeter)
Sweeter then a females lips
Kiss like the diamonds that smile on my wrist
(No matter what my mind says)
Even when my mind says this
My heart keeps pumpin, oh they the hot shit
(Your music gives me feelin')
Pain is for the masses captured
People bring me down, materials uplift

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
(life) what a vacation
Even on my ego trips, no rooms vacant
And tenants giving 10 inches of the hatred
Still not want One foot in my greatness
My statement, I am .prodigy, prophecy
Neo to the matrix, hip hops savior
Outer space patron, married to the game, only stars I’m datin
My love is unconditional but only to the franklins
Councilin don’t ever prevent marriage separation
You can plea my life’s equation
My love couldn’t amount to the songs you gave me
When I wanted out it was you that saved me
Flaunted you for clout now I’m Patrick Swayze
Was a street rat, now an apes and baby
Seen a couple places now for you I’m crazy

[Hook: IIO & Machine Gun Kelly]
