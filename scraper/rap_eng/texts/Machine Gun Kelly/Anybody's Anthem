[Hook: Machine Gun Kelly]
So this is for the kid
Who don't got inspiration to vibe to
When you wanna dream
Got music to close your eyes to
Let the top down
This is the song you ride to
Type of feeling
That's you happy to be alive too
You never count it out
So when you down and out
Get up and stand up
Everybody got an anthem now
Y'all got an anthem now
Y'all got your anthem now
Attention people of the world we got an anthem now

[Verse 1]
This is my pursuit of happiness
Come and ride with me
Its a beautiful day
Somebody feel alive with me
Y'all wanna know what hard is
Somebody reach inside of it
It be the ones that don't say none of that
Got the biggest size inside in them
I was that lame kid, that sixth grade kid
Back of the class, look like a nerd
But not the biggest brain kid
But it was that same kid
That made the game flip
Man of the city
Now everybody know the name kid
Where are my sleepers at
I mean my dreamers at
Cause I use to dream
About this moment in my sleeping bag
Look where I'm speaking at
Imagine eating at Italian shops in Italy
Like where my Visa at?
Then take another seven forty seven
To the states the same day
Cause success is always begins
From the place that them came
Me I'm a city boy
But I'm no different
So everybody from the streets out to the country

[Verse 2]
Hold up
My cups is mold up
I've been fighting for this change
My pockets are swelled up
Even when the weathers colder
Convertible folder
Chilly diamond chains in my rings rose golder
My life [?]
Like I'm having a baby now
Had to get a little chilly
Cause my tummy wasn't officially there
But I'm craving now
All that good life Kanye
Was talking I finally figured out
It ain't bout my ends
Its bout my friends family and making out
And if I would sold my soul
Imagine what I'd be
So what if I ain't the most successful
It was meant to be
I learned to cope with all these emotions mentally
Express it through my music
My everyday is a symphony
This is for the bird
This is for the block
This is for the nerd
This is for the jock
Hot shot off to the real man up
To the [?]
This your shot
You see the target
Go and land on
This your heart
We are the world
And its your anthem

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This moments classical
You want it magical
Look inside of yourself
Its autobiographical
Its so easy to think
Things are owed to you
But is those same desires
That grow old to you
Just love
Life live
Good take advantage
To any opportunity
You should
And when they say you can't
Go respond and do it
I did the same and
Achieved what no other rapper could
And it don't matter where your from
Its where your headed to
If you rather than what they said before
Its what I'm telling you
Half of these people
Don't want to see you get a damn thing
Wanna pull you out the fast lane
And park you handicap man
From the streets to the crib
From the beach to the bridge
From the hood to the coldest [?]
Don't let them hold you back
I spark the anthem and
Gave you the flame burn with it
I'm on the top
You want me down
You better come with it

[Hook]
