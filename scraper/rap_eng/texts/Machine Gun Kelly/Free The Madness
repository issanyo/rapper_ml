[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly]
Free your mind
Free, free your mind
C'mon, c'mon, yeah, yeah
Aoki, Kells, uh!

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
If the leather fades and the children age
And the love we share separates
In a perfect world, do we know we're done?
But I don't wanna grow up, not for anyone
I wanna be alone with the system home
I wanna take control of, but never own
If I could free this
I said if I could free this
If I could free this fucking madness in my mind

[Hook]
Free your mind
Free, free your mind

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
Kells
And if tomorrow I wake up and I’m sixty years old
I hope when I look in the mirror and ask "Have you lived?"
I look right back and say, “Shit, you tell me!”

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
So I smoke this herb with my homies
Park the car with my homies
Couldn't afford a roof over my head
But I let that bitch burn with my homies
We're living life in the moment
Walk in this bitch like we own this
Screaming out "fuck the world" till it's morning
And if I can free this
Madness I could stop the screaming
The inside of my mind needs freedom
And it's magic on a perfect evening
All I wanna do is have a little sunlight
All I wanna do is drink a little moonshine
I can show these motherfuckers how it's done right
Don't nobody out here wanna have a good time?
When the summer days turn into the past
With the runaways and forever outcasts
Every age come and get into the future
'Cause nowadays our youth does not last
I wish I could free this
I wish I could free this
I wish I could free the fucking madness in my mind

[Outro: Machine Gun Kelly]
Free your mind
Free, free your mind
