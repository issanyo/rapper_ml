(Hook: Mike Posner)
I am on fire
I feel like I can't stop burning
I am on fire, yeah
I fell like I can't stop burning

(Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly)
Tell me why does everything that's bad feel so fucking good
Devil in a red dress she killing me I she knew she would
So bury me one foot for every inch of heel shes wearing
Im in lust still I can't trust this bitch but I keep on staring
Matter fact, fuck that, no emotions lets get high as fuck
I don't need a light she fires me up
Pullin out white like a Styrofoam cup
No hair cut but she lines me up (what the fuck)
I don't even do this shit
What would happen if my friends knew this shit
And why the hell can't I refuse this bitch this shit is crazy

[Hook: Mike Posner]

(Verse 2-Machine Gun Kelly)
She got her legs spread wide for the kid
And she begging me to come get up in it
Touching herself while I take off my 11's
Got a girl back home and she calling every minute
So I pick up like BITCH mind your mother fucking business
I'm serious, I'm trippin', no literally I'm trppin'
Out of all those drinks anything could of slipped in
Not to mention what she had me sniffin
But she grabbed my dick
Told me forget about it and bit my lip
I told her turn around while I turn the music loud
Whenever the bass hits then you strip
And then she did
But she pulled a little baggie out of her panties and put a pill on her breast
My mind said no
My dick said yes
I'm willing to do whatever to feel her sex
This shit is crazy

(Hook: Mike Posner)

(Verse 3-Machine Gun Kelly)
And she told me speed it up
Fuck me good
Beat this pussy up like you should
Lay back down, keep it up
Let me show you how a real bitch do
All she wanna do is get dick and run
All I wanna do with this chick is cum
I've been in the pussy for about 2 hours
But I can't feel my shit, I'm numb
Her legs shaking and my legs do the same
But it moves to my chest, to my brain
To the nerves in my face, so I can't feel that motha fucka
But this ain't Novacane, bitch quit playin
I dont even know your name
What the fuck you do to me she said
I'm the same one sellin Oz to Mike P and the one that made you OD
You stupid bitch
