[Intro: Chief Keef and (Machine Gun Kelly)]
Sosa baby
Reportin' live from the GLO pad
Gang in this bitch
You know how we rockin', cut off stockings
Kush in my pocket nigga, all designer
Get yo' girl number
Get ready for the turn up (Hahaha)
Smack the shit outta him (Aye!)
Smack the shit outta him

[Hook: Machine Gun Kelly and (Chief Keef)]
Young man, young man (all my youngins' in this bitch)
Young man, young man (all my youngins' in this bitch)
Young man, young man (all my youngins' in this bitch)
Young man, young man (all my youngins' in this bitch)

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Young man, young man, I don't want to hear that no mo'
Bitch I done grew up blew up, more like OG for sure
They call me a savage (they call me a savage)
I be doin' damage (I be doin' damage)
Smokin' with your bitch (smokin', smokin', smokin')
Posin' for the camera, I look like a model (fuck it)
Jamo out the bottle (fuck it)
40 in the glove box, that shit fill you up with hollows (boom)

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Where the smokes at?
Roll it, roll it, roll it
Cash in a bag
I hold it, hold it, hold it
Niggas hatin' on me
I know it, know it, know it
Got a pint of the narcotics
You know I'ma pour it, pour it, pour it (Bang!)

[Hook: Machine Gun Kelly and (Chief Keef)]
Young man, young man (all my youngins' in this bitch)
Young man, young man (all my youngins' in this bitch)

Young man, young man (all my youngins' in this bitch)

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
Bitch I pop, top, on your block, on the west side feelin' like Pac
Bandana swing out my pocket
Middle finger up, muthafuck cops!
Catch me in the land with the hat back
Matte black Range Rove', pistol where the lap at
O-Z in the backpack
26 years old, more hoes than the Rat Pack

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
Young man, young man, I don't want to hear that no mo'
Bitch I done grew up blew up, more like OG for sure

[Verse 4: Machine Gun Kelly]
This is for the mothafuckas who ain't livin' by the rules
This is for my youngins' out here, finna act a mothafuckin' fool
I'm forever young blue and red pills feelin like the Matrix
You know where I'm from, don't nobody ask for nothin' we just take it

[Refrain: Machine Gun Kelly]
Young man, young man (always stay down for your bros, man)
Young man, young man (do not ever break the code, man)
Young man, young man (don't get caught up in these hoes, man)
Young man, young man (go live that live that you suppose to,) turn up!

[Hook: Machine Gun Kelly and (Chief Keef)]
Young man, young man (all my youngins' in this bitch)
Young man, young man (all my youngins' in this bitch)
Young man, young man (all my youngins' in this bitch)
Young man, young man (all my youngins' in this bitch)
