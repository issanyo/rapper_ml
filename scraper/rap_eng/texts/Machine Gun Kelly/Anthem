[Chorus]
So this is for the kid who don't got inspiration to vibe to
When you wanna dream, that music to close your eyes to
Let the top down, this is the song that you ride to
The type of feeling that you just happy to be alive to
You never count it out, so when you down and out
Get up and stand up, everybody got an anthem now
Ya'll got an anthem now, ya'll got your anthem now
Attention people of the world, we got an anthem now


[VERSE 1]
This is my pursuit of happiness, come and ride with me
It's a beautiful day, somebody feel alive with me
Ya'll wanna know what heart is, somebody reach inside of it
It be the ones that don't say nothing that got the biggest size in 'em
I was that lame kid, that sixth grade kid
Back of the class, look like the nerd but not the biggest brain kid
But it was that same kid, that made the game flip
Man of his city, now everybody knows the name kid
Where all my sleepers at? I mean my dreamers at
Cause I used to dream about this moment in my sleeping bag
Look where I'm speaking at, imagine eating at
Italian shops in Italy, like "where my visa at?"
And then take another seven fourty-seven back to the states the same day
Because success always begins from the place that they came
Me I'm a city boy, but I'm not different
So everybody from the streets out to the country, let's get it


[Chorus]
So this is for the kid who don't got inspiration to vibe to
When you wanna dream, that music to close your eyes to
Let the top down, this is the song that you ride to
The type of feeling that you just happy to be alive to
You never count it out, so when you down and out
Get up and stand up, everybody got an anthem now
Ya'll got an anthem now, ya'll got your anthem now
Attention people of the world, we got an anthem now


[VERSE 2]
Hold up, my cups is moe'd up
I've been fighting for this change, my pockets is swolled up
And when the weather's colder, convertible fold up
Chilly diamond chains in my Range Rove's golder
My life's strange, it's like I'm having a baby now
Had a get a little cheddar cause my stomach was inefficiently fed
But I'm gravy now
And all that good that Kanye was talking, I finally figured out
It isn't about my ends, it's about my friends, family and making out
And if I would've sold my soul, imagine what I'd be
So what if I ain't the most successful, it was meant to be
I learned to cope with all of these emotions mentally
Express it through my music, my everyday is a symphony
This is for the burbs, this is for the block
This is for the nerd, this is for the jock
Shouts out to the real man, ???
This is your shot, you see the target, go on and land on
This is your heart, we are the world, and this your anthem


[Chorus]
So this is for the kid who don't got inspiration to vibe to
When you wanna dream, that music to close your eyes to
Let the top down, this is the song that you ride to
The type of feeling that you just happy to be alive to
You never count it out, so when you down and out
Get up and stand up, everybody got an anthem now
Ya'll got an anthem now, ya'll got your anthem now
Attention people of the world, we got an anthem now


[VERSE 3]
This moments classical, you wanted magical?
Look inside of yourself, its autobiographical
It's so easy to think that things are owed to you
But it is those same desires that grow old to you
Just love life, live good
Take advantage of any opportunity, you should
And when they say that you can't, don't respond and do it
I did the same and achieved what no other rapper could
And it don't matter where you from, it's where you're heading to
It's irrelevant what they said before, it's what I'm telling you
Half of these people don't wanna see you get a damn thing
Wanna pull you out the fast lane & park you handicap, mayn
From the streets to the crib, from the beach to the bridge
From the hood to the cul-de-sacs
To the warming careers, from adults to the kids
Don't let them hold you back
I spark the anthem and gave you the flame, burn with it
I'm on the top, you want me down you better come with it


[Chorus]
So this is for the kid who don't got inspiration to vibe to
When you wanna dream, that music to close your eyes to
Let the top down, this is the song that you ride to
The type of feeling that you just happy to be alive to
You never count it out, so when you down and out
Get up and stand up, everybody got an anthem now
Ya'll got an anthem now, ya'll got your anthem now
Attention people of the world, we got an anthem now
