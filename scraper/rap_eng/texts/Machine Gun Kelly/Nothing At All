[VERSE 1]
Looking at this map and I don't know which way to go
Where I am, I'm so lost
I could've swore that I took this trip with all my friends
Look again and they gone, that's the cost
All I know is that I'm surrounded by all this stress
I'm a mess, they don't see, they don't care, cut the checks
"Baby you should stop dreaming and get out of bed
Pay the rent" is what she said, what she said, "So get dressed
You don't call, you don't write, and you start and we fight
I have dreams every night of becoming your wife
But tomorrow's a new night, said I hope you do right
But I'm gone cause these calls from these broads that you like
Just don't forget that I've been there from the start
Don't you dare let this shit tear us apart
I'm having your child and you left me in the dark
Oh my god, superstar, I swear you've broken my heart"

[Chorus]
Staring out my window, glaring at the snow (at the snow)
Tell me is that the reason why I'm so cold?
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
Calling up my friends and all I get is the tone (is the tone)
I'm alone, it's so clear this isn't home (isn't home)
So I'm gone, so I'm gone, so I'm gone
So I'm gone, so I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

[VERSE 2]
Man I wish I knew when all these things went astray
Matter fact, I just wish it could all go away
And it seems like even on the sunniest day, the clouds come
And the rain falls on my window pane (window pane)
Even if I knew why, what kind of help could I get
Let's face it, what I get ain't paying no doctors check
My closest cousin is a schizophrenic, now he gone with medics, and I ain't talk to him since
Ever since that moment, I felt that we been falling apart
First my moms, then I felt my grandmother dying in my arms
And of course how could I forget my pa?
Unconditional love, though we ain't never gon' get along
What I would give if I could visit my aunt
Every night, every day, but we live so far apart
Don't think I forgot you were there with my through it all
You so strong and for you woman, I would give you my heart

[Chorus]
Staring out my window, glaring at the snow (at the snow)
Tell me is that the reason why I'm so cold?
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
Calling up my friends and all I get is the tone (is the tone)
I'm alone, it's so clear this isn't home (isn't home)
So I'm gone, so I'm gone, so I'm gone
So I'm gone, so I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

[VERSE 3]
Why can't you see that I can't be here no mo'
Cause success is a threat to these hoes
I don't have a problem leaving this shit alone
Cut my phone, pack my bags, and never look back at home
You read about it and I live what they write
I've hit licks, I've been robbed
Dealt with fights, day and night
These streets ain't home, they simply gut us too wrong
??? fuck this life
I'm my own man, I gotta keep moving
I don't jump to conclusions because I know what I'm doing
I'm a grown ass man, so accept that
I'm try'na be a father to my kid
So all these haters step back, yeah

[HOOK(Chelsea Bowen)]
And I don't know if we can make it
With what they're saying in this game we're playing
Feel like it's one-on-one in a court without a ball
If it was you or the world, I would take nothing at all

[Chorus]
Staring out my window, glaring at the snow (at the snow)
Tell me is that the reason why I'm so cold?
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
Calling up my friends and all I get is the tone (is the tone)
I'm alone, it's so clear this isn't home (isn't home)
So I'm gone, so I'm gone, so I'm gone
So I'm gone, so I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
