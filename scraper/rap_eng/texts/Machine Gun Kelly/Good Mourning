[VERSE 1]
Congratulations, welcome to your new life's orientation!
They wonder why they call you baby
When you're head to toe with tattoo abrasions
Maybe it's cause I'm in the crib
Louie rag ??? conceals my outfit
And when I want, I want real big
And I'm not afraid to scream like Jeezy ad-libs
They like, "Okay it's time to hit the road Jack"
Fresh air in me, feeling like cognac
A new bounce in me, guess I got the toad back
Waving goodbye, knowing that I'll never go back


[Chorus]
Good morning, I gotta wash the sleep up out my eyes
Good morning, I gotta get fresh before I step outside
Good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning, goodbye


[VERSE 2]
Attention, class in session
Hit the corner store to grab my snack concessions
Cause I, know that I ain't gonna read too much
Raised on a grain of salt, I don't need too much
But I, must day dream, I must stay clean
??? the soap bar I used this morning
New hood, new walk, new face
Sick of all the old miles I ran in old lace
Instead I threw on my Chucks and strolled
Waved to the sun with my top down and rolled
Pockets bowed, outta my Artful Dodgers
Good day, I'm the neighborhoods Mr. Rogers
Now I'm not against the world
Been long enough now I'm finally by my girl
Finally by my dawgs, right beside my team
Good morning real world, I'm outside my dream


[Chorus]
Good morning, I gotta wash the sleep up out my eyes
Good morning, I gotta get fresh before I step outside
Good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning, goodbye
