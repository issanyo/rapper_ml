[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though, I
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold, sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go, yeah

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
And I never thought for a minute
If you showed me a picture of my life now, that you wouldn't be in it
Took me a couple months to say I loved you, but I meant it when I said it
Wasn't much of a romantic, but you get it
Didn't really smoke, but when I rolled it up, you hit it
And we lit it up, shotgunning our kisses
I used to have someone at 3 am that I could call
Now it just rings and I don't get nothing at all
Where you at girl?

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
When you looked over your shoulder, yeah
For a minute, I forget that I am older, yeah
I wanna dance with you right now (right now), oh
You look as beautiful as ever, hey
And I swear that everyday you will get better (right)
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus]
I'm so in love with you
I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
(Say you won't let go)
Just say you won't let go
(Say won't, say won't go)

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Machine Gun Kelly]
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go, oh
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go (say won't, say won't go)
Say you won't let go
