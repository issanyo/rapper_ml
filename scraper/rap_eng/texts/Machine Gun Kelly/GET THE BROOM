[Intro]
Honorable C.N.O.T.E
Okay, let's get it

[Chorus]
Picked up where I left off, four-three-two-one lift off (yeah)
Went to get the broom, I had to beat a bitch off (whoa)
People get so crazy when you rich and famous (ay)
But I ain't no jackpot hoe, and this ain't Vegas

[Verse 1]
Ay, don't be asking questions about who I'm dating
Ay, even if I gotta girl she know I'm playing
Ay, smoke that tree like Willow, then moonwalk like Jaden
Ay, bossed up, got my gang rich, like this shit contagious
Ay, twisting up my fingers, no this ain't sign language
That's that gang shit, how Iâ€™m raised back on that up the way shit
Earn my stripes, you know I spilled my blood all on the pavement
Knocked that man out, had to make a million dollar payment
Let's get it

[Chorus]
Picked up where I left off, four-three-two-one lift off (yeah)
Went to get the broom, I had to beat a bitch off (whoa)
People get so crazy when you're rich and famous (ay)
But I ain't no jackpot hoe, and this ain't Vegas

[Verse 2]
Not at all, but the top floor, rented all
Hoes in hotels, and the hall
It's like Odell, how I ball
Got a whole sale with the straw
Now my nose red from the raw
Mug shot, locked up abroad
Fuck the police and the dogs, hold up
Break through rules 'cause y'all don't own my life
Man, suck my dick
Cops so racist, thirteen years old
Lost my boy, shed tears for him
Raised by wolves so when I'm nice
You know that's me in rare form
Used to ride that public transportation, now I'm airborne
I still ride or die for everybody that I care for
Let's get it

[Chorus]
Picked up where I left off, four-three-two-one lift off (yeah)
Went to get the broom, I had to beat a bitch off (whoa)
People get so crazy when you're rich and famous (ay)
But I ain't no jackpot hoe, and this ain't Vegas (let's get it)
Picked up where I left off, four-three-two-one lift off (yeah)
Went to get the broom, I had to beat a bitch off (whoa)
People get so crazy when you're rich and famous (ay)
But I ain't no jackpot hoe, and this ain't Vegas
