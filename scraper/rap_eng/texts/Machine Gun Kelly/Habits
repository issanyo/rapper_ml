[Verse 1]
Ay
Complicated
Frustrated
Underestimated
Can't sleep, mind racing
Hard to stay concentrated
Foreign towns, missing home
Please don't forget about me
Tell the story, all the glory
Fuck what they say about me
Some days I feel
So out of place with all these fake people in my face
I cannot relate, yeah
Sometimes I feel
Like I create, and they just take everything  I make
Turn around and then hate
Maybe I was living off expectations
Or I was born in the wrong generation?
(That's probably it)
Meanwhile I'm crushing weed overseas
Hopefully tonight we'll find more
Long days on tour
Backstage getting boring
But step on stage and they roaring

[Bridge]
I fell in love with a very bad habit
But I feel alive for the very first time

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna die
But I don't, I don't wanna hide
Or keep shit inside
I will not cry, so
I deal how I deal with it, deal with it
I am 13 hours clean and still counting
Save me from these day dreams about it
Under full moons, night swims, and tattoos
I cannot stand these fucking rules
I been sailing too long in cold water
Restrain me from these pills and more doctors
And erase me from this page and start over
I wanna start over

[Bridge]
See
I fell in love with a very bad habit
I was alive for the very first time

[Verse 3]
You said goodbye when I was trying to say
”Something ain't right inside of me”
I wanna run away
(I want to run away, run away)
I don't wanna stay
(I don't wanna stay, I don't wanna stay here)
I wish you could relate
I'd wish upon a star- fuck that, leave it up to fate
We are who we are so don't judge me
Just 'cause it's hard to smile
Read between thin white lines
See what's in my mind

[Outro]
I fell in love with a very bad habit
But I was alive for the very first time
You said goodbye when I was trying to say
”Something ain't right inside of me”
I wanna run away, yeah
I don't wanna stay here
