[Verse 1:]
Yeah, g-shit
And I ain't smokin' none of that unless the weed stick
Bitch I'm in the zone and if I ever leave
Fuck a jacket I'ma rock my tattoo sleeves
I got thirty naked bitches in the kitchen
Crumblin' the herb and rollin' it up in the Swishers
Kush is my cologne, every minute blowin' heavy
I don't smoke it on occasion, everyday is 4/20
All I do is flame shit, I don't do that change shit
EST for life bitch, ya I do that gang shit
Look at who I came with, better fix ya face quick
Cause I gotta lot of muh-fuckers with me we all on the same shit
Now pass me the dutching-ton,
I still gotta nickle crumbled in the George Washington
Order up a quarter my connect is on the phone
Mix the purple with the lemon G kush and get stoned
God damn it im gone, blowin' with the wind
Cleveland is the city, see it showin' on the brim
Black lights on the tats glowin' on my skin
And my blunt is never lonely all my L's got twins blaze up!

[Hook]
Yeah, blaze up, lil' bitch blaze up
So what the fuck blaze up, ugh, blaze up, kels Blaze up

[Verse 2]
And we burnin' up like the heat is on
Kelly smellin' good, blowin' wood
Bitch my life is like a weed-a-thon
Size 12 Chuck Taylors what my feet is on
Laced up blazin' back to back like repeat a song
And fuck the police boy, I say it proud
And if they hear me fuck the police say it loud
20 dollars and a dream bitch I'm livin'
Back strokin' in yo girl, no swimmin'
(Sorry) boy that's pimpin'
You wanna know my goal, a couple sold out shows
Some hoes and a pocket full of woah
Got it for the low, tear the place up
Pass the dutch and blaze up, motherfucker lace up

Ughhh. blaze up,
Hundred words and runnin
Lace up. lace up bitch. EST blaze up
Kels laced up. Gone
