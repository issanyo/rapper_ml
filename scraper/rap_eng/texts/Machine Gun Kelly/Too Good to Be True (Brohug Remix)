[Intro: The Vamps]
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true

[Verse 1: The Vamps]
The way that you move
You take me to heaven
The things that you do
You got me confessin'
Got me confessin'
You fell from the sky
Type of perfection
Is this real life?
Is this real life?
There's something about you

[Chorus: The Vamps]
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
Ooh, ooh
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
Ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: The Vamps]
Oh, no baby don't lie
When you say that you'll be mine
I can't look in your eyes
'Cause I fall a thousand times
And all I want is you to testify, ooh
Oh, so baby don't lie
When you say that you'll be mine

[Chorus: The Vamps]
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true

[Verse 2: The Vamps]
I don't go to church
So be my religion
I'm hung on your words
Give me something to believe in

[Chorus: The Vamps]
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
Ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: The Vamps & Machine Gun Kelly]
Oh, no baby don't lie
When you say that you'll be mine
I can't look in your eyes (in your eyes)
'Cause I fall a thousand times
And all I want is you to testify
All I want is you
Oh, so baby don't lie
When you say that you'll be mine

[Chorus: The Vamps & Machine Gun Kelly]
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true (ooh)
You're way too good to be true

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly & The Vamps]
Gunner
I shut down for you
Go in and dove in and drown you
They should be crowning you, 'cause
You're way to good to be true
Hold up, hold up (ayy)
Please don't hesitate
Take me while there's still something left to take
Baby you're all that I crave
Tell me how many days do I have to chase you?
Do I have to chase?
Before I taste you
Before I can say
I can escape you
I cannot escape
Baby you're way too good to be true

[Chorus: The Vamps]
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
