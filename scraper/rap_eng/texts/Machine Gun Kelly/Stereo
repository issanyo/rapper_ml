[Hook: Alex Fitts]
So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uh, there I go
Two clicks north of the Bronx
Whoever thought she would of found love in a stereo
2 headphones and a box
She picks me up, every morning on the walk to school
She ain't worried bout these other little kids
Cause she told me everyday you sayin' something new
And you always got the illest kicks
Boom Boom tat
And she takes me out, just so the block can see
Told me she wanted the world to know
So she makes me loud now the whole block wants me
But I'm all hers and she's all mine
And even though her parents don't like me inside
Whenever her daddy comes around, we just hide
Cause she doesn't wanna sleep without me that's why
I said

[Hook: Alex Fitts]
So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me

[Hook: Alex Fitts]
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah, and she loves my sound, It's why I'm always around
Voted the most popular girl in the class
Cause whenever were together we attract the crowd
Yeah and she got me down
Touches the right place when I'm fizzling out
And all of her friends love me
Cause at all of the parties, I make em bounce b-bounce
Uh, if I play the right song, she might take it off
Meaning her clothes
You know I love it when she keeps the lights on, play the music soft
Yeah, so that's what I do, anything for my boo
But when I hear the knock on the door
I Shhh-shut up, cause I know my cue
But when they gone, I'm back at it
She loves this song, so I blast it
Dad gets home, I hide in the cabinet
Flip my switch like gymnastics
Uh and I'm a always be there for you, you just gotta find my plug
I'll be right here waiting for you in the middle of these speakers
If you ever wanna find my love
So

[Hook: Alex Fitts]
So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me

[Hook: Alex Fitts]
So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uh, and she gets older but I stay the same
And as she grows up, her opinions change
Now shes off at college
Where there's other ones like me
I just hope that one day she'll come back
To hear another song from me
But till then, I just sit in her room and collect dust
Thinkin' about us
Waitin' for the day she'll push my buttons
And I feel her touch and get that rush
But I'm not what she needs, so I power down
Then right at that moment where I was found
Hello, her little sister walked in
Knew it was love at first sight
Caught a little twinkle in her eye when I made a sound
She snuck back in the same night
And even though she knows that she wasn't allowed
I know all she wanna do is be near me
One thing is that I felt the same
Wanna tell her but she can't hear me
So so I said

[Hook: Alex Fitts]
So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me
