[Verse 1]
See I've been searchin' for somethin' out there
When is it comin'? Tell me
What to tell myself
When I drink so much that it hurts my health
'Cause I stay up way too late
And I owe a million favors
I can't overstress myself
So I wrote it down to express myself
I'm lookin' in the mirror tryna find
Peace of mind in a piece of my
Inspiration back from the beginning
Life's a movie, I can't make revisions
Ate an eighth of shrooms and started trippin'
Had some visions that were nonexistent
I think I just left the solar system
Doesn't matter, I still kept the rhythm
Diamonds still gon' light up like a prism
That's from years of grindin' independent
What was at the bottom now has risen
If this isn't Heaven then what is it?
Always real but never realistic
Want the world but nothin' in specific
Don't need shootin' stars to grant my wishes
I'm a superstar, let's go and get it

[Chorus]
Kiss the ski-i-i-i-i-i-ies, the sky
Kiss the ski-i-i-i-i-i-ies, the sky
Kiss the ski-i-i-i-i-i-ies, the sky
Kiss the sky-y-y-y-y-y-y

[Verse 2]
Now can I, lay underneath you?
While they play all the previews
And I'll pretend like I'm restin'
Maybe you'll skip to the end and
Pass all the irrational decisions
Patch up all the passion that was missin'
I think that's enough, I'm feelin' lovesick
Rollin' loud, I'm on some turnin' up shit
Paid a couple hundred for a high that I couldn't get on my own (on my own)
And I've been lookin' for a long time, but I never found home
Everything is alright, I'm around for the long ride
Go get drunk and find some trouble (ayy)
Add some pieces to the puzzle (ayy)
Couple rights, couple wrongs
That's the prequel to the sequel (yeah)
And all the space in between us
Are memories that we conceal
The jagged edges of a pill
Remember what it is to feel
Windows down behind the wheel
Gotta do it for the thrill, watch me

[Chorus]
Kiss the ski-i-i-i-i-i-ies, the sky
Kiss the ski-i-i-i-i-i-ies, the sky
Kiss the ski-i-i-i-i-i-ies, the sky
Kiss the sky-y-y-y-y-y-y
