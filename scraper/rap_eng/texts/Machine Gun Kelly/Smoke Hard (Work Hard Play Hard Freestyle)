(Bridge)
Roll one, smoke one (x4)
Smoke (x9)

(Verse1)
OG all on my J's bitch
OG's all in my gang bitch
OZ’s only no eighths biatch
Get the fuck out my face bitch
Eyes red like this mace, bitch
Bad boy like I’m Mase bitch
Puff once then say grace bitch
Get it? That shit cray bitch
Yea, I came from the bottom but I’m underground
I made a hundred thou without an album out
But then I lost it all on 'bout a hundred pounds
My dude uh
Your bitch talk too much, I had to fuck her mouth
Caught her at home alone when she was on the couch
I told her roll one up and we were smoking out
My dude uh
This weed government issued, I’m gon' need a rank
And they said this the bomb shit, I’m gon' need a tank
Damn, and with all this hate, shit I might need a shank
But it’s fuck ‘em all cuz I got the strong
That's gon' blow your mind so fuck what you think
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

(Hook x2)
The bigger the scale, the bigger the zones
When I break it down, my blunt is long
The quicker the hit, the higher you go
That’s why I stay high, cuz the only thing w know is
