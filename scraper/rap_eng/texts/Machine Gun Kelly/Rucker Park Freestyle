[MGK]
It was all a dream motherfucker, 17 muhfucka
Trying to ball like I’m playing on a team muhfucka
Like Kareem motherfucker, what it seems muhfucka
Me, I’m out here winning, Charlie Sheen muhfucka
On any given Sunday, Willie Beaman muhfucka
In the hood like Radio Raheem muhfucka
Blowing good but this ain’t no porn scene muhfucka
This that smoke until your numb as morphine muhfucka
Because the life is a fucking war scene muhfucka
So much grimy shit, I’mma need quarantine muhfucka
Aye and then maybe I can ride clean muhfucka
Hit the ghetto in a black limousine muhfucka
And how dare you ever judge me muhfucka?
Paid my daughter’s college fund with 16’s muhfucka
Baby mamas out here trying to Billie Jean a muhfucka
But I’m on my trill shit, bringing Bun B to the Rucker, nah I mean muhfucka?
