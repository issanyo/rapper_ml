[Verse 1]
Promethazine at 13 muthafucka,
Everything slow motion, I'm not an earthling muthafucka
And you are not a girl your a goddess
Us  against world, girl I got us
Benihanas for them lame shits
She in the kitchen whippin cheese eggs with the same hand that she rolled the Js with
6 inch heels
5 course meals
4 years she's been my 32, my center like Shaquille
One time for my bad bitches
Whose mouths are sacreligious, cuz magic is a sin, and my dick always vanishes
Pictures on the cam of me shakin her ass
Cuz we drunk and wanna make this moment last
And the way yo back arch, when u lay on that cushion
The way yo toe's curl blowin smoke rings on the pussy
Make that muthafucka cream, from squeezin on her cookie
She want me to make her scream, I ain't a killer but don't push me
Police wanna lock me down, haters wanna shut me up
Bitches fuckin with me now, u was with me coming up
So Ima hold u down cuz u the only one that I can trust
2 fingers represent and throw it up, Lace up bitch

[Hook]
And when it all falls down, and there is nothin left
I'll still be around, Kells tatted on her breast
I look up to the stars, made a wish to have everything in a girl
Look down and there she is the baddest bitch in the world
Baddest bitch in the world
You the baddest bitch in the world
Baddest bitch in the world
She crazy but I love my babygirl, baddest bitch in the world

[Verse 2]
Popped her cherry at 14 muthafucka,
Dropped out and now she pop it-pop it-pop it like the twerk team muthafucka
Embarrassed of the fact that she a stripper
But maybe that's the reason that I'm with her
Gave me excuses to fuck with these other hoes, while she dancin on a dick
Knowin that she can't say shit
Fighting every single night, but we fuckin every day,
But She know how to hold her own, and she do everything I say
Bad bitch, 
(what she do?)
 Left class just to pick me up and smash
We ain't even go inside I just fucked her on the dash
Bad boy, so she love it when I smack her on the ass
Friends jealous cuz they wantin what she have
Scars underneath my tatts, she be worried I just laugh
Sit back and roll a zig zag up with some hash and let it ash
Cuz if the world crash then at least we already fell into love
And the J already burnin so wassup, muthafucka 
It is us against the world so wassup, muthafucka 
Back against the wall so wassup 

[Hook]
And when it all falls down, and there is nothin left
I'll still be around, Kells tatted on her breast
I look up to the stars, made a wish to have everything in a girl
Look down and there she is the baddest bitch in the world
Baddest bitch in the world
You the baddest bitch in the world
Baddest bitch in the world
She crazy but I love my babygirl, baddest bitch in the world
