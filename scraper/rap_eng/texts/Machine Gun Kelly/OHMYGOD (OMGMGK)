[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]

And I heard that
Foreign cars is the only key to their hearts
And it's no love and I'm locked out
Cause all I got right now's my balls
And fuck these blond, 'celebritantes'
Wanna be rappers tryna be hard
Labels tellin' me I'mma gamble
I'm just tellin' them play their cards
Cause I work hard matter fact no
More specifically I work jobs
Flippin' burgers, scrubbin floors
Matter fact I deserve applause
And fuck these stars
We on earth
Kept it real amoungst these frauds
And did what they said wasn't right
How does it feel to be fuckin' wrong
Huh?

Hook:
Oh My God! No one understands me here
So put your hands up, If you dont give a fuck
Im never gonna be like you (everybody)
Put ur hands up if you dont give a fuck (fuck, fuck)
Im never gonna be like you (everybody)
Put your hands up if you dont give a fuck (fuck, fuck)
Im never gonna be like you (everybody)
Put your hands up (hands up)

Verse 2:
Yeah and I like my chucks dirty as fuck
Attitude mean like how I grew up
Hold grunges like I hold my nuts
Never sober so I hold my cup
And I never had much but I always lived
The best times were when I didn’t have shit
20 dollar denim hopin' that I fill the pockets up with somethin' a little more than this balled up lint
Im a Cleveland kid with a world wide dream
Blue collar boy tryna chase that green
No red lights im going full speed
No limits on whatever I want to achieve
I been through hell that’s why im hot
I fear no man alive but God
Take anything of mine away
But take my passion they cannot
