[Verse 1: MGK]
Yea Cleveland on my back uh
L's up when they see me
Came from the underground now they on t.v
Swear to god ha
Ooh Machine Gun Kells, dub-o
Look look you can miss me with that rap shit
You can miss me with that stereotypical "he isn't lyrical"
Barbershop chat shit
Miss me with that frat shit
Only university i graduated
Was hard Knox
I'm from  Cleveland
Where they trap shit
Five bucks for the catfish
Five bucks for the  bad bitch
Five bucks in a drought in this city could get ya piece of that cactus
With saran wrap for the wrapping
Whatchu mean?
Meaning we bundling all of this loud into Garcia Vegas
I swear its contagious the way that we passed it
Patches on my denim vest
About as old as my dad is
Blood stains on my chucks
Cause well you know what that is
Jet lag from these long flights
Still sitting coach like its practice
Feeling like students when the schools back I’m trying to see what first class is
Cash is the root of all evil
But maybe that why i do bad shit
Fact is i do what we need cause the country
And no Catholic or Baptist
Warlord or pacifist,could've seen what I seen without
IMAX's and 3D glasses
Yall in family houses like Bob Saget
Both parents i was on family couches
Like you don't want it i'll wear it
Inheriting hammy downs as a grown man embarrassed but
These dreams seemed far fetched
When reality is you’re sharing a shirt
And a shower, and shitter while your newborns in the carriage
Packaging groceries in bags for an hourly seven dollar average
This ain't living this is strife
This is Hennessy and this is just sprite
But Maybe one day they'll remember me like they remember Mike
When I'm gone
Mother fucker, god dammit "that's what I'm talking about
Maybe they'll remember me when I'm gone
"what else?"
I ain't done
Look when my times up on this earth
And they bury me in that dirt
Don't say that i ain't milk this life
For everything that it's worth
{yuhck}
For everything that its worth
And when i die remember me like Kurt
..BANG!

[Verse 2: Dub-O]
Look they said Dub quit with that humble shit
You can only be cool for so long
But don't misjudge I'm not
The one you wanna rumble with
Write it down take a pic
Do what ever you have to do to remember me
I'm in your memory for infinity
And the same goes for your bitch
Remember me from Kennedy
Or east high on the east side
Were them niggas die over anything
Yeah, dub-o
Oh you ain't know
I got go i rock shows
And i'll be calling plays like flaco
But I'm so Cleveland
It's a damn shame
And est is my damn game
I've been reppin that
Since way back
And that double x is my campaign
Pop bottles that champagne
Its Cliquot for the champions
Now where the hell is my damn ring?
Biatch, celebration for nothing let you believe what you see
I’m in the back but no frontin
Seven days out the week i be working
I'm full of hunger
That jealousy is the smell of defeat
And remember who told ya
I'm gone "motherfucker"
Just remember me when I'm gone
Dub-o eh
When that times up on my watch
And they bury me in that box
Don't say i ain't give my gang
Everything that i got "real shit" yea
Everything that i got
And when i die remember me
Like PAC BABAYY

"Est mother fucker"
" lACE UP MOTHER FUCKER"
BLACK FLAG MoTHER FUCKER"
