[Chorus: Elle Varner]
I never waited on a miracle
There ain’t no miracles round here
There ain’t no miracles…
I’m not afraid of the impossible
There ain’t impossible round here
There ain’t impossible, no

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I ain't afraid, knowing shit’s gotta change
One day it’ll never be the same
Just look into my heart you can see the grind
Look into my eyes you can see the pain
Painted a perfect picture where I came from
Some nights when I thought I wouldn’t see the sun
Son raised, though daddy wasn’t home, word
Hard tryna hold it down like a short skirt
Skurr off from these niggas tryna hold me back
I will not lose, Hov told me that
Dreaming bout a moment that’ll change my life
I don’t never wanna wake up, turn off the lights
Gotta let it burn, I’ve been ready to ignite
I said nothing’s impossible
See me runnin through the city, no obstacles
No option two, one way to go

[Chorus: Elle Varner]
I never waited on a miracle
There ain’t no miracles round here
There ain’t no miracles…
I’m not afraid of the impossible
There ain’t impossible round here
There ain’t impossible, no

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
I ain’t afraid, it’s nothing more I gotta say
To them haters middle finger, up to yo face
Facing so many problems, hate being tested
From a place where they waiting to see me arrested
No rest, tryna make it where I wanna go
Alumni but I couldn’t make the honor roll
Too cool for school, I’m too rude for Jude
There’s no rules in the life we choose
I gotta ride for something, gotta die for something
Say you only live once, we’ll I keep it 100
Mo money, mo problems keep on coming
Tryin, a nigga go back but these niggas keep frontin
Right now everything going right, it could fuck up tonight though
Said nothing’s impossible
See me runnin through the city, no obstacles
No option two, one way to go

[Chorus: Elle Varner]
I never waited on a miracle
There ain’t no miracles round here
There ain’t no miracles…
I’m not afraid of the impossible
There ain’t impossible round here
There ain’t impossible, no

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
I ain’t afraid, I’m already dead
I just don’t know when we goin'
It’s crazy how the devil gets us when we heaven-sent
My hands already red, I lost so many men
Heavy is the head that wears the crown that I’m wearin' man
I was a loser just tryna fit in a letterman
But those were school days, I grew up, now I’m on Letterman
I never thought that a song I wrote in a minivan
Would ever have the impact I’m reading inside these letters man
"Dear Kells I heard yo story and felt it man
Your voice inspires, I feel like I can do anything
By the way, I sent you something from my brother"
Open it up, a razor fell, he was a cutter, damn!
What if you were me, in 2003?
Rap was just a dream baggy jeans, burning blank CD’s, feed 'em to the streets
Would you let adversity hide you? Or, conformity guide you?
Or realize everything you need’s inside you?

[Chorus: Elle Varner]
I never waited on a miracle
There ain’t no miracles round here
There ain’t no miracles…
I’m not afraid of the impossible
There ain’t impossible round here
There ain’t impossible, no
I never waited on a miracle
There ain’t no miracles round here
There ain’t no miracles…
I’m not afraid of the impossible
There ain’t impossible round here
There ain’t impossible, no
