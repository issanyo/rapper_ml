[Intro Guitar]

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Am I loud and clear?
Or do I gotta scream like I did every day when I was a troubled teen, huh?
Do you want to know my past and see every single scar and know what they mean, huh?
17 running up in Mickey D's begging for a double cheese, huh
Singing "I don't want to grow up don’t nobody like you when your 23"
I came from nothing but a fucking unsupportive father I don't ever see
I had to watch a crooked jury put my brother in the penitentiary,
I never fit in
Criticism, made me the man I couldn't be
I'm reminiscing on when life was different spending every day at Chuckee Cheese, uh

[Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
We live on front porches  and swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I’ll slave till the end
And I’ll run these streets if you give me a chance

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I've been here so long
Maybe I should runaway
Try to find a summer day
What is love
Love is pain
Love is butterflies and stomach aches
Love is looking out a windowpane, tears dripping looking like you’re in the rain
For someone you don't even know but for somebody you may never see again
I am only alive once
And I'ma die when God wants
So fill the sky with diamonds
Because that's how it's gonna look when I'm gone
Had a vision as a kid that one day I would change the world with my song
Several years have passed and now that vision came to life that boy's a fucking icon

[Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
We live on front porches  and swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I’ll slave till the end
And I’ll run these streets if you give me a chance

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
Sometimes I don't want to fucking wake up
When all they want to do is bring me down
And all the things I’ve went through as I came up
Are the fucking reasons why I run this town

[Hook: Kellin Quinn & Machine Gun Kelly]
We live on front porches and swing life away (and to my fans, I told you)
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor, I'll slave 'til the end
And I'll run these streets if you give me a chance
We live on front porches and swing life away (all my dreamers)
We get by just fine here on minimum wage (stay real)
If love is a labor, I'll slave 'til the end (and to my love)
And I'll run these streets if you give me a chance (stay here)
Swing life away (what we do)
Swing life away (and what we do)
Swing life away (yeah)
Swing life away (and we just)
Swing life away (let's swing life away)
Swing life away (let's swing life away)
Swing life away (let's swing life away)
Swing life away
