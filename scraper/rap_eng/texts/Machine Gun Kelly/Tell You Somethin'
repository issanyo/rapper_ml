(Verse)
Damn, (Peter Parker) 16 not a kushy in the jar take a hit now I'm floathig next to Pluto
Super bad, used to dream one day I'd be a star, Hollywood big screen like Juno
Yeah, so I hopped up out the bed
Said fuck school layed at the crib
And lived every single punchline that I have ever spit
Cause reality to me is behind my eyelids
Gone, and don't mind my ad-libs
A lot of these rappers young but I am that kid
(Kells) That piff, chillin' in the hood, light it up
Now my minds in the heights like where my dad lives
Can't hate though, not at all man
I'm in the stadium and I am not a ball fan(No)
Or a ball player, just freshman with a team, now let me ball hater
(Swish) Leaning, give me my balls hater
Jealousy took over their lives, I'm the cause hater
And the most 10th graders want my autograph paper
Meanwhile my bread comin out the cheese grater(Ha, bitch)
Yeah, I am the greatest
So bad when they need me, they be saying tsk tsk
Boy, I'm raw as this fish in the sea
See me, get off my bitch's dick
At the cornerstore, heavy dog
Pull up in the lot, open doors, see heavy fog
All I needs a brownie, Arizona and a funyon
Plus a hotdog, extra relish got the munchies like a muhfucker
Blaze up till you face up
Got the hardest bars in the game, step your cage up
100 words and runnin', you better lace up
If you can't tell I'm a star, step your knowledge of space up
Uh, Gangsta? Nah I'm fuckin' with ya
All my girls back in Shaker, yo what's up with ya
Up in their blouse, boyfriends couldn't trust me
Couldn's stay in the house because the streets love me
And everyone who hated just mad they couldn't become me
Ain't it crazy I'm celibate when everybody says fuck me
Probably cause they think your boy musty
Stinky rich and the flows ugly like ugh
