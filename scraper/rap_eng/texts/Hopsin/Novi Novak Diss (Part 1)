" Hey Novi, You're the fuckin best man, how the fuck do you do it bro ?
One Million youtube views? WOOOOAAAAAHHHH SHIIIIIIT
YOU'RE GOOD MAN YOU'RE GOOD

Yeah, Lets kick it off RAW
FUCK NOVI NOVAK
He's a bitch for sayin' my name and I hope he knows that
His flow is so wack wit his dosi-do swag
Lil B's level is one, but your level it goes below that
Dont be so mad, Cause this is your fate
Your music dont push no weight
How Hopsin got more fans than you in your state ?
You're so fake
I move like a Lamborghini with no brakes
You cold but I'mma fuckin ice glacier, you a snow flake
So dont hate, be real
You not from the hood dawg.. (come on man)
You want the truth on if your progress is good naaw
You think you cute cause you shit talkin and look tall
Nigga your neck looks like you swallowed a football
Fuck yo dick my cock is a foot long
Me fallin off is kinda like you droppin a good song. (never)
So quit rappin stop messin' with me
Yo big buff ass belongs on a wrestling team man
So see me in Chicago faggot you'll be boo'd oh wit bruised bones
Either that or sent to your new home (PEACE)
And I'll be up at your funeral widda suit on
Next to ya momma who suckin' my dick behind yo tomb stone
You got no time for diss tracks or broke computers
Cause you busy workin wit these multi-platinum producers
Fuck Novi hes a faggot and a loser
Im swagin' on his future
It's like sickin a dragon on a rooster
Face facts, you dont have any thug signs
I know it cause you smile after all of your punchlines
I woulda personally dragged your ass to the morgue
But if I showed up to your house, YOU WOULDNT ANSWER THE DOOR
So shut the fuck up. "
