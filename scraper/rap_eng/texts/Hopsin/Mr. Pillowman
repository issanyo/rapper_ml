[Chorus]
Mr Pillowman, you can sleep on me. And i'll fulfill your dreams
I'm the
Pillowman, you probably heard about me. I'm more than what I seem

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time there was a boy named Mr. Pillowman
He had enough rage bottled inside to even kill a man
And always went out of his way just so that he could get a friend
He'd ask for opportunities but nobody would give a damn
And he would always hope he made it, cause he was so creative
But he was slowly hated going through these dopey mazes
He'd never hesitate whenever a test was given
He'd pass it with an A+ but get no recognition
At 19 years old he thought he caught his break
And understood that patience and motivation is all it takes
His mother was so happy for him that she bought a cake
I wish you could have seen the smile on his father's face
Two days after that, he was feeling lost and dazed
The man who was suppose to be his hookup was talking fake
Now this is oftly strange, his world is cloudy as it softly rains
As he's crying out loud, his heart would sing...

[Chorus]
Mr Pillowman, you can sleep on me. And i'll fulfill your dreams
I'm the
Pillowman, you probably heard about me. I'm more than what I seem

[Verse 2]
Mr Pillowman. Nothing but a civil man
Always felt that his success was just around the riverbend
He'd smile in your face but down in his heart he'd be sad
The world would never acknowledge half of the talents he had
22 years old he thought he caught his break again
Because his buddy hooked him up, and it's for surely thanks to him
That Mr. Pilloman, is happy and so proud of his life
Wow this is nice, it's like he felt the power of Christ
He knew that God is good and God is bold, It's time to Rock and Roll
Somebody finally understood he was a pot of gold
His lack of success was to the point where it's gotten old
But patience was the key, so the stories often told
...Then his buddy called, and said "I hate to tell you
But that connection that I hooked you up with never fell through"
Then Pillowman's like "What the hell dude? You said this was a swell move
I'm probably better off trying to sell shoes"

[Chorus]
Mr Pillowman, you can sleep on me. And i'll fulfill your dreams
I'm the
Pillowman, you probably heard about me. I'm more than what I seem

[Verse 3]
Here's a secret. I am Mr. Pillowman
Going on 25 and I'm wishing I could live again
I've reached out to people but yet nobody would lend a hand
I feel like i'll never be able to pay my rent again
I'm getting old and time is crucial, feels like I'm not as useful
My only meals consist of Kool-aid, and Ramen noodles
...I wish I had more, but my mom and dad's poor
So when you see me don't bother to ask me what I'm mad for
..Yeah you can laugh about it. But I'm just sad and pouting
Seeing motherfuckers make it who don't have no talent
That's 10 years of my life that's down the drain
I feel like a true failure living life without a brain
But yo, I'm still trying to get a name
Rapping on the mic and spitting flames maybe i could get some change
But I'm at the point I'm about to say "fuck it"
Cause I released a nationwide album and I never made a buck from it

[Chorus]
Mr Pillowman, you can sleep on me. And i'll fulfill your dreams
I'm the
Pillowman, you probably heard about me. I'm more than what I seem
