[Intro]
What the fuck are you doing? That is the question
Come a little bit closer I want to teach you a lesson
You - my friend - my buddy - my pal
I think it's time you get the truth now

[Verse 1: Hopsin]
What up everybody it's H-O-P
Please simmer down go and take your seat
'Cause there ain't no peace
I seen a lot of motherfuckers who entered the contest and they so weak
A small percentage of niggas started off soundin' okay but they didn't ever remain on beat
I'm tellin' you right now
If you already went and submitted in it then you ain't gonna make no cheese
Sorry Bro, hate to bust your bubble
Put the mic on down go the fuck home, cuddle
I spark rappers out and creep up so subtle
And then they yell "uh oh, I don't want no trouble"
Come journey into my cut throat jungle
Where I leave rappers and sluts so puzzled
If you didn't notice I'm loaded with heavy artillery
Nigga I can fuck around and crush your hustle

[Bridge]
Yeah, oh right, I bump it all night, I got bitches on my dick
They say the love me all the time and I still sound very fly
Even when I don't even try
This here is my new jump off I call it Suicide

[Verse 2]
None of you niggas is about the prosper
You on more bullshit than Waka Flocka
Don't cry to me 'cause I'm not your papa
I'm as hot as lava
2012 I'ma stop the drama (OH YEAH)
I know I be yapping a lot
Maybe 'cause I have the fattest of cocks
I'm me, you should be mad that your not
Now sit and wait for Knock Madness to drop

[Outro]
WOAHH woah
Boi got flames and he ain't playing around no more
I say
WOAHH woah
Boi got flames and he ain't playing around no more
Knock Knock Knock Madness
Knock Knock Knock Madness
Knock Knock Knock Madness
Knock Knock Knock Madness
Knock Knock Knock Madness

[Collison]
Yeah, get ready for
Get your ass ready for
C'mon
Get get ready for
Yeah, get ready for
