[Hook: Don Trilo]
I'm feeling like my life has just begun
I'm too young, what if tomorrow never comes (never comes)
You're too young, you gotta fight for number one
What you'll do so, remember you're second to none (second to none)
I'm feeling like my life has just begun
I'm too young, what if tomorrow never comes (never comes)
You're too young, you gotta fight for number one
What you'll do so, remember you're second to none (second to none)

[Verse 1: Mic E.D.]
Okay I'm not perfect I made mistakes and I know that one day I will pay for them
I know that I hurt many people I could've prevented it, sorry I'll pray for them
I'm headed in so many different directions
I cannot imagine a future
From where I'll be in years a mystery haunting I guess we used to 'em
Flashing images haunting my brain but it’s great like lightning’s forming
My head is just pounding, thunderous side effects ‘cause my brain is storming
I got so much on my head, on our heart, and some saying that I feeling so empty
You think that I'm heartless, slippin' no conscience
You know I'm here defending
My character can’t be defined by this everyday answer to searching for meaning
I’m whispering under my breath but inside of my head there’s a voice that's screaming
It's a meaning and it fiending
So feed on every person, running they mouth then calling me worthless
More than meets the eye beneath the surface
I'm living this life, I am with its purpose
And with Hopsin on the track you know the flow is murderous
Smashing all you haters 'cause I'm done with being courteous
Honestly their thought of quitting inches doesn't occur to us

[Hook: Don Trilo]
I'm feeling like one life has just begun
I'm too young, what if tomorrow never comes
We're too young, we gotta fight for another one
What you'll do so, remember you're second to none
I'm feeling like one life has just begun
I'm too young, what if tomorrow never comes
We're too young, we gotta fight for another one
What you'll do so, remember you're second to none

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
I'm stuck in a cold ass world trying to get my cash straight (cash straight)
And I'm living every single day like it's my last day (last day)
And I try so hard not to walk around with this mad face (mad face)
But still ain't blown up yet, success has been nothing but a sad wait
Every second of every day I work hard, some motherfuckers think I'm not (shit)
But I'll be damned if I ever let one of you little niggas come and take my spot (nah)
And fuck any bitch who's focused on how much cake I got (bitch)
This world is the root of all evil, and believe it's gonna be the place I rot
Stay tuned in, I'm not done, see tomorrow might not come
You never had your hand for tiny type of fame, at least I can say that I got some
One life I ain't really tryna waste it
I'm tryna make it, but so impatient
I don't know if I can take it
I post up tryna make dope hits in the basement
It ain't hard to see that this nigga Hopsin is nothing less than second to none
And when I tell you that I'm killing the game it's without a weapon or gun
When I spit this ill shit on the mic you niggas wonder how
Don't ask no questions nigga, I'm tryna make my mother proud

[Hook: Don Trilo]
I'm feeling like one life has just begun
I'm too young, what if tomorrow never comes
We're too young, we gotta fight for another one
What you'll do so, remember you're second to none
I'm feeling like one life has just begun
I'm too young, what if tomorrow never comes
We're too young, we gotta fight for another one
What you'll do so, remember you're second to none

[Verse 3: PA]
I found myself feeling more lost, everything that I'm living
Begging for one another chance, with everything that I can give 'em
Please explain to me why I try and I try but I see no change
I'm ducking a thousand of devil from launching themselves within my lane
Second to willing to toss it up, place it inside my own head
If I don't see tomorrow, will they remember me after I'm dead?
Trilogy Mafia and Hopsin are captioned hiding up in my past
So if tomorrow don't come then I hope I'm breathing to take one's blast
Give me the strength then ambition to see the path I'm s'posed to take
Everyone hoping I fail, they wish me the hell but fuck to hate
I live it today because, life's not promised to anyone
In case of example my brother was taking a short time after twenty one
I'm way too young to feel like I'm living my life towards potential
Different day, different events that I write down with my pencil
If this is the end of my time I'm hoping to grind or find my ways
Spitting these words and smoking these herbs, praying to god for one another day
