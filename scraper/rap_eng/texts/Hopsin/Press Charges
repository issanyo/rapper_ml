[Intro speaking]

[Hook]
In the night, Inside your home
There lies a boy who's oh so cold
Traveled far along this road
To take the soul
Of a bitch so heartless
I'mma make you pay for the heart that you stole from me
I think she might press charges
I don't think that the cops can take full control of me
Shoulda never fucked with Marcus

[Verse 1]
Wow, You really are a ho, You finally got the kid convinced
Listen, Bitch. I don't have to make no freakin' sense
And only think I'm gettin over is your picket fence
Last time we saw her was Saturday, She's been missing since!
Hmm, Maybe 'coz I stole her
That ho was bipolar
I'm sick of skank ass bitches fuckin' my life over
But I dont hit girls, I sexually knock 'em up
She cheats on me, I chop her up
FedEx come and box her up
Me sayin "Screw you, Don't call me again" is not enough
I'mma make you and your family suffer from alot of stuff
Don't tell me to tone it down, motherfuckers, I gotta cuss
We'll never reunite, there's nothin' left I got for us
What hurts the most is your family knew you were playin' me
Everything we had was make believe
I can't believe
I fuckin' trusted you
I shoulda never fucked with you
Now you're gonna suffer the consequences, sucks for you

[Hook]
