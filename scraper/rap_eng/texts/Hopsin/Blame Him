[Intro: Nay Nay, Hopsin]
Yo Hopsin
Blame him
Blame me?
It’s Nay Nay, yeah
Someone tell these low down and dirty fuckers who Hopsin is
Someone tell these low down and dirty fuckers who Hop-Hop-Hop
Someone tell these low down and dirty fuckers who Hopsin is
R-A-W R-A-W nigga

[Verse 1: Hopsin]
I use to give a lot of fucks
Now I’m corrupted, focused on how to get my dollars up
Showing these bitches riches so they can give my cock a suck
Without the money I’m nothing, they tell me I ain’t hot enough
That’s why I look and dress like I’m evil
Depressed like an emo, I guess I’m the sequel
Of what my old life used to be
Take a trip inside my mind and mother fucker you could see
The reason that I rap so violently
Product of my society, makin a living finally
By brainwashing your kids to be me
Scary contacts, fuck school ADHD
You went to college and I went to the basement
I made it at 21, you struggling at 28 bitch
Plus I got the mind of a two year old
How does it feel knowing I’m your kid’s new hero, yo

[Hook 1: Hopsin]
Shit I never went to college
Ain't nothin to it, Kanye West made me do it (Forever, Ever?)
I call my girlfriend a bitch
Ain't nothin to it, Slim Shady made me do it (haha)
I’m big pimpin’ your daughter
Ain't nothin to it, Jay-Z made me do it (The Roc!)
And if I rapped (What!) like a mother fucking maniac
Ain't nothin to it, DMX made me do it

[Verse 2: Nay Nay]
They all called me a disaster, cause I wanna be a rapper
But I'm an average white kid that they saw through, just like Casper
And a career like that is one that I should not chase after
Cause it would get me nowhere and I'd never reach that chapter
But I ignored all their warnings, Laughs, and corny jokes
I practiced late at night when they were sleeping just like normal folks
Cause I was on a mission that I'd reach all my nocturnal hopes
By going through these sleepless nights writing with my holy ghost
Then holy smokes, you would never guess what I had came across
A side of me that somehow disappeared with time that I had lost
Time that I spent fooling and never lost in thought
Well I found that part of me and what you hear is what I got
Now you may not be impressed too much from what I will present
But anything I say to you will not be something I resent
I speak the truth and never asked for all my compliments
But when I get them I just feel as if they're heaven sent

[Hook 2: Nay Nay]
I became a mental giant
Ain't nothin to it, Tech N9ne made me do it (Cha!)
I made you remember the name
Ain't nothin to it, Fort Minor made me do it (10 percent)
I don't stress about the world outside
Ain't nothin to it, 2 Pac made me do it (At thugs mansion)
I went psycho on this track like that
Ain't nothin to it, Hopsin made me do it (Hop, Hop)

[Outro: Nay Nay]
Someone tell these low down and dirty fuckers who Nay Nay is
Someone tell these low down and dirty fuckers who Nay-Nay-Nay
Someone tell these low down and dirty fuckers who Nay Nay is
R-A-W R-A-W Nay Nay
