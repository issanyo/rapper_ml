[Intro]
We all got that special someone in our life, ha I know I do
Shoot, but sometimes things don’t always go the way you plan
And that’s when I get mad, and I don’t like when I get mad
You won’t like when I get mad, we won’t like I get mad
Here’s a song I wrote, and it goes like this:

[Chorus]
Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
You ain’t got no privacy
Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
Don’t be tryin to hide from me

[Verse 1: Hopsin]
You make my life so whack
One day my mind go’s snap
Blew up like nitro gas, call me a psychopath
Yup just like your dad
Accept I don’t need the alcohol to make me put a scream mask on and give your house a call
And I don’t give a fuck about the law
Cause you won’t have fingers to dial up the cops I just found my saw
I had enough of you and that’s about it
You make me so mad, I don’t get angry I cry and laugh about it
I’m not the one that’s up at your house every other day
That’s knockin at your front door hard and then runs away
I’m the one with the fucking blade
The one that’s at your front door making your ass scream “put the gun away”
And I’m the one up on your roof that’s right
With a new flashlight
Watchin the shit that you do at night
And I don’t care if you ain’t coo with it
I’ll cut your face off stitch it to mine then murder bitches so they think that you did it

[Chorus]
Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
You ain’t got no privacy
Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
Don’t be tryin to hide from me

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Oh you think that I be creepy?
Look out your window bitch, you’ll probably see me
Then get your fucking face shot with BB’s
I’m from the ghetto I know how to mug you
Show up on the spot and cut you
And if I beat your ass its cause I love you
You fail to see that
Whore I’m clingy? Don’t be telling me that
You kissing him? Damn right this is a jealous-y act
I’d rather fuck with you instead of relax
But when I’m done you can bet I’ll be back
Bitch defending my pack is way crazy
You make me stay angry
You gonna be in love with me?  Okay maybe
I don’t wanna turn this into the worst disaster
I wanna live happily after, chilling with hella laughter
But you like the man on some crack
This shit led to the macs
You lucky that you ain’t got hit in the head with a bat
I’m already knowing I’m sorta psycho (Haha)
But you won’t ever find another dude who loves you more than I do

[Chorus]
Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
You ain’t got no privacy
Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
Don’t be tryin to hide from me

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
I used to make you nice old songs
Now it’s the psycho songs
Cause I’m the dude you don’t like no more
I was a nice a guy years a go
Now you make me miserable
I had to put this shit up on a track to let these niggas know

[Bridge]
Why do I feel like, the police are watching me
There’s nothing you can do to me
Why do I feel like, the police are watching me
You don’t have to look past it’s me

[Deputy Doyle]
We have subject Marcus Jamal Hopson in custody now

[Hopsin]
Man!

[Commanding Officer]
Bring him to the station, Doyle! Now!

[Hopsin]
Aw, man
You watch Tracey, you won’t get rid of me
I don’t care how hard they try
How far you hide
I know where you live, what car you drive (Hahaha)
This ain’t the start of the end
You gonna see Marcus again, there's no arguing friend
I’m gonna be given you prank calls from the pen

[Deputy Doyle]
Yeah, right!

[Chorus x3]
Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
You ain’t got no privacy
Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
Don’t be tryin to hide from me

[Outro]
But I love you
