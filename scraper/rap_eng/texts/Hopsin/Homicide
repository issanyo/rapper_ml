[Hook: PFV]

It's a homicide
I made a promise I'd never be the one die
Never be the one to lie
Down on the side of the gun where the hammer falls
Act tough it's your bluff that I plan to call

[Verse 1: Hopsin]

Who wanna step up to hate?
My murders are up to date
Last nigga who wiled out the cement is where I drug his face
Eyes on you bitches like I'm looking for a slut to rape
Hold you underwater 'til your lungs inflate: suffocate
This verbal brutality I'm spitting makes the fans holler
When I'm on this mic nigga you gon' treat me like your damn father
I'll fuck you up and murk your mama so you can't call her
Call it what you want but this shit here is manslaughter
If you catch me on your block put your Nike's on and run fast
Cause I'm a psycho killer trynna swipe your skrilla-
I got my gun stashed
Ain't got no bullets in it but I got a knife that will leave your guts gashed
Hang you upside down from the tub maybe I can take a blood bath
You know what? Nigga fuck that
I'm bout to get me a buss pass
Take it to your crib, break in and drag you 'til you get a rug rash
Your homicide is not needed by a flock of guys and that's not a lie
And I promise I will not apologize you should have known from my psychotic eyes

[Hook: PFV]

It's a homicide
I made a promise I'd never be the one die
Never be the one to lie
Down on the side of the gun where the hammer falls
Act tough it's your bluff that I plan to call

[Verse 2: PFV]

This ain't what I wanted
But it's time to confront it
Got my sick with and my knife drawn like I'm on and I'm hunting
Y'all better get out my way thinking I'm bout to fade giving it all today. Clever
Got my sentiments out the way
Looking to doubt the day living without a brain- never
They ask me if I'm gonna kill 'em I say damn right
Shit's intense like five hippies at a camp sight
I get so mad and frantic that I just can't write
What's left is Baghdad without the bagpipes
I'm so unsociable, making the most of nothing
To these fish up in the ocean I'm a shark who pardons nothing
I'm a marksman I'm not bluffing
I got sulfur in my stomach
And I'm spitting bars of fire at your circles whole circumference
I'm aiming at every rapper that seems to be after the gold and I'm
Predicting the battles like I'm Nostradamus and I got the soul of Nas
If I could have all of your idols inside of a building at one time-
You guessed it
That shit's a homicide

[Hook: PFV]

It's a homicide
I made a promise I'd never be the one die
Never be the one to lie
Down on the side of the gun where the hammer falls
Act tough it's your bluff that I plan to call
