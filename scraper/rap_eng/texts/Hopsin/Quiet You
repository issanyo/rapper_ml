Intro
(Announcer Clears Throat) - Attention all Funk Volume contestants, Jimmy E.L.E, has a public service
Announcement for all you wack mofos, and it goes!

Chorus
Halts Maul, Sekut, Cierra la boca tu, Quiet you
Shh Shh quiet you, Shh be quiet you
Shh Shh quiet you, Shh be quiet

Verse 1
Zip your lips, shut the fuck up, you talk too much/ Can it bitch, smoke this shit, you fucking suck
Damara Seru, Fermez La Bouche bitch, I just said be quiet you in two fucking languages/

Yo, bitches babble, this isn't scrabble, you fucking assholes/ Now smoke these joints cause you don't get more points for vowels/

Let the silence devour you, cause silence is very powerful, give it an hour or two/ If I were you, shit I wouldn't speak for years, you might learn something new, (like what?) like a fucking career

Yeah, get on your p's & q's queer, like Pacquiao/ Jimmy knocking cocky niccaz out like Rocky pasquale style/ Wild child, hoes really want me now, I'm real current, they're in my ear, they're purring meow/ Wow, I really love your fucking style, shut the fuck up ho and put it in your mouth

When I was down & out shit you were down & out, except you were on your knees and spreading trout

Oww! Truth hurts don't it? Yeah Jimmy but now I don't condone it/ Plus I was very very stoneded,and I was homeless, and it was only for a moment/ Bitch zip your lips, I know you're honing in on my cojones!

Chorus
Shh quiet you, quiet you, quiet you, be quiet
Halt's Maul, Sekut, Cierra la boca tu, quiet you

Verse 2
Shhh Silencio, here goes a Mentos for your breath as my pencil begins to bring your death mental
On instrumentals I pen flows and let goes the most suspenseful prose since Edgar Allan Poe penned prose
Nemeses are nevermore, anulled by words scorched, ring of hordes are tossed in the fires of Mordor
Hardcore lyricist since the day that I was born, I bleed red ink into a poetical form
Storms brewing, I'm ruining em, and tearing through em, like I am a typhoon and part human
The big kahuna will monsoon em, with big bada booms, and boom bap pows to sonic boom em!
Hakuna matata, spewing the fruzen gladje, acumen goes gaga, whenever I habla the avera kedavra
Like Harry Potter, Santana Abraxas, La Bamba Weya Chuna, Bumble Bee Tuna, & Chicaca!
See it don't matter, if you rap faster, and the subject matter doesn't match up, then you're just an actor
Delivering quivering shivering flows, but real niccaz and bros know you're just a gimmicky ho, Oh!
A passing trend you'll go as fast as when I'm passing wind, so blow it out your hole friend, then bend
Your jaw closed and SHUT THE FUCK UP!
