I'ma keep it really simple
Niggas already know when the flow is so sinful
Filled full of insults, I don't even need a pencil
Just give me a beat that's sick and a dope tempo
'Til you hate your life, but yet afraid to die
'Cause you don't know whats gonna happen when the lights out
I really recommend you niggas get it all together
So you don't need to worry 'cause it can happen right now
I can see why you're afraid of it
It's so spontaneous, living life is a crazy risk
Especially if you don't ever find god and you turn into an atheist
So many times I look up in the sky then I ask god why is it raining clouds on me
But I got a feeling that I’m talking to myself and there’s nobody lookin' down on me
Enough with the conscious rap, I'ma drop and bomb shit
You can all get racked, for talking crap
I soften cats on this mic, advice 'cause I'm a boss in fact
I'ma cause this track, to break down 'cause I got a flawless act
I killed this shit where's the coffin at?
Hoes get up off his back, around me balls get slapped
Man my CD has got to be the reason that I wanna go and squash MCs
I'm in the game but it's not for peeps, you watch and see
It's my turn, 2Pac's deceased, I gots to feast
On all these imposter G's, who run around thinkin' they can possibly
Blow up, little niggas you ain't hot to me
And if you did blow that'd be a shock to see
