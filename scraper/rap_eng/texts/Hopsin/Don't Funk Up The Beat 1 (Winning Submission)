[Verse 1]
I'mma show, wreck a ho
Get to got up in the game to get more
Shatter all, you better know the label’s prone to rest, we go
Check your blade to your vein and I’m making it rain
I bring pain to the game and they say I’m insane
I maintain with the chainsaw makin' your brain
Just hang in the stains everything in it’s way
Hopsin and I, hop on the beat and your top’s gonna fly
Get stopped in the street, I’m a popular guy
Rockin' the beat while I’m shoppin' online
Stoppin' this rhyme is impossible
I’m not plottin' to stop till I drop and I die
Talk shit avenger is a moppin' up guy
Choppin' your top, send it off in the sky (lost and goodbye!)
Put the rest in the trunk, I’m impressing you punks
I’m ingesting the flesh then I get to the chunks
Of the meat that I eat out your chest and your lungs
And they feed me by teeth then the rest of it’s done
I guess I’m obsessed with the death and the pain
Put a dent in your brain I’m the best in the game
The machete already got left in your frame
Pull it out, I’m about to let the red start to rain
I’m a criminal, individual gettin' you, hittin' you with the sickle
When it enter you, it will itching you
Splittin' you and rippin' you into two
If you really ain’t feelin' any price
Just screamin' like a little bitch don’t you
I’m sicker than syphilis do you get it?
I'mma wreck it every minute
Every second that they put me on a beat
I really wanna get ‘em and dead 'em
And never let 'em get ahead of me
And leave 'em all bloody in the street, motherfucker I

[Hook x2]
I feel like I already won
So why they’re even trying?
That five hundred’s already mine
But they’re just bound to fuck it up (yeah)
They fuck it up (yeah)
If you put them on a beat after you give it to me
You can see these other MC’s just fuck it up
