Yo Hop
This beat is dope

I followed hopsin
As soon as I heard of him
Illuminati 
Couldn't fuck with
The dude
He would murder them
Purge the sin
In K.M
He said he needed help
The fame, life and wealth
Was changing him
I tried to help
I couldn't reach dawg
I believe in you
Your wise freedom of speech dawg
All you haters ease off
I tried twitter
As an artist myself
You might not consider
Thinking free promo 
My aim
Cause you a hitter
I didn't wither
Seeing you do it 
Gave me hope
Practice my rhymes 
You kept it dope
You don't even smoke
So you never choke  
5 to 7
You never joke
7 gave the world a stroke
I just hope that you could cope
In a way you showed me the ropes 
Live by faith 
Hop 
Even if your reign  stop
You can always gain top
Fuck a flame drop
You done came up. 
But we fall short still
Time
 to get your faith up

Yo Hop
You got so many fans
Looking up to you
We just wanna see continue on the right part
Even tho it may seem hard
Don't give up faith
