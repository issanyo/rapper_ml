[Verse 1]
Yeah
Homie I ain't never had a hand out
Had to spaz out, till I passed out
In order to see the cash route
I'm killing shit just like the mad cow, disease
You wanna hustle, I'll show yo' ass how, believe
To the world my whole vision was a blur
Coming up never got the recognition I deserved
A diamond that was living in the dirt
The feeling really hurt
That's why a nigga had to go berserk
If you don't believe in yourself, no-one else will
Wasn't literally living in hell but it felt real
Had to chase the dream, to make the cream
And show the world that my momma raised a king, nigga
It's hard tryna find the right exposure
And times only running out as I get older
But everyday I get closer, and closer
The moment I blow up, I'm yelling I told ya
Prove the haters wrong, really motivates me
Got em all looking like "No it can't be
He stunting on niggas, I hope it ain't me
Swagger looking cool, bout as cool as they see"
You're damn right it is, so mind your biz
Its time that you all know what grinding is
Looking like I lost my damn mind again
Its your boy Hopsin, and I'm signing in
Come on

[Hook]
Life at the moment ain't luxury
Niggas ain't never had love for me
Staring at me like "Who the fuck is he?"
Trust me dawg, put your trust in me, come on
Ain't got time to be playing with y'all
When the competition, yo, I'm slaying em all
To come up as real, when you making it hard
But Imma keep rising till the haters disolve, you know

[Verse 2]
Yup
I finna advance
Its only right that I get my chance
You trying to take my spot, better sit back man
I'm bout to murder everything, that's a sick ass plan
You know
Nah, y'all ain't never paid no mind to me
You were way too busy denying it
Y'all know what time it is
Bout to feel my wrath
I dare y'all to question the skill I have
Its pretty obvious now
Gotta sick style
Pockets on wow
I know how to get down
Spotlights on, you know Imma show out
I'm already knowing that my momma so proud
The throne that I'm on, so great to be on
Glad that I got a fucking plate to eat on
I ain't a great yet, but I aim to be one
And when I am one, I ain't taking refunds, yup
You better write it down on a sticky note
That other nigga killing shit, is he really though?
Give it to me and Imma show you how to get it yo
You can't even see me up on vimeo
I know the struggle and how tough it get
When you not getting enough respect
Niggas thinking that I'm bluffing, shit
This is blood and sweat
And I'm going hard like I'm straight busting checks
You better recognise
When I rest in peace, my legacy won't be forgotten
My nigga you gon' remember mine
Haters thought they'd never see the day I ever shine
I'm the one my ex girl should have kept in mind
Nah, those days are gone but not forgotten
You should see the whip that I be hopping out in
I just started a new trend, you can watch it rocket
Now go and, ask about me boy, I'm bout it, bout it

[Hook]

[Outro]
Imma keep on rising
Keep shining
How is he so viral?
Got niggas on my dick and they all running up
And they so excited
