[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, I just sold out the Brooklyn bowl
Now I'm in the lab like a kitchen how I'm cooking so
Y'all niggas soft as cookie dough, what's the hoodie for?
Me I'm silent as a rock with Allen Iverson rookie goals
1996 shit, the misfit
Knew I was a rockstar but didn't think it was this slick
Now I'm on your girlfriend's wishlist
I'm overlapping rappers making sure the caption on point
Tell 'em I got em, she can come through and be the next on the blunt
To be the GOAT, you gotta be disrespectful enough
These bitches be setting you up after letting you fuck
And I'm just hoping Donald Trump get jumped by Mexican thugs
Who down playing? Point 'em out so I can roundhouse kick 'em
The Soundcloud killer, never smoke a pound with 'em
Bumping Pound Syndrome by my nigga Hop
Fans asking where is SwizZz, don't trip my nigga, finna drop
Plus I get to live a lot from murder rapping I'm deserving tatted
I'm for sure I got the power like I'm Curtis Jackson
Y'all ain't making no plays, y'all acting mad
Smoking weed is a happy habit and I'm looking like one of the captains
Focus on my freedom as it was me then I would lead  'em
Judge people how we see 'em, that's how we treat 'em
And I'm missing my grandfather, wish I could go to heaven and meet him
To 2Pac, Biggie, Left Eye, and Aliyah
But instead I'm writing weed on this weed a lot [?]
How far have we come in 50 years since Malcolm X was shot
Setting goals even though we grew up in a melting pot
Put down who the realest, look around nigga

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
I'm going in like a heroin needle, just hand me the eagle
Nigga your money short like Danny Devito
You a faggot, dirty dancing with a man in a speedo
Your whole squad trash, I'm no fan of your seagull
Gram a coke and a can of Doritos [?]
Jarren ain't that nigga that abandon his people
I can land torpedo at your man in a [?]
My clique got that shit like hand in fecal
I'm truly weird, so unruly nigga
The beat get pissed on like Drake in a movie theatre
So what you know about? Your momma wonder bout me
I'm a pimp, I smack a bitch just like I’m Ronda Rousey
I'm grouchy, wake up, knock out your fucking mouth piece
A field nigga, record labels wanna house me
Bitch it's Funk Volume, we got a ill posse
So why the fuck you sleeping on us like we Bill Cosby
Fuck 12, I hate Jay
These haters jerking on my dick like a Shake Weight
I got abandon the issues, I never said it well
I spazz on niggas like Diddy with a kettle bell
Oh my fucking God, LOL
And when that gun go BLOW, you get that metal smell
Mr. Benton stay on with a few scraps
Your clique all bitch like Orange the New Black, nigga

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
Rappers where is your conscience? Is this a popularity contest?
I wouldn't be surprised if you showed up wearing your mom's dress
Niggas buying nice cars but they don't even write bars
The mic's ours, we ain't attacking this shit with light hearts
I let my verbal chopper spray
The industry had locked me out, I hopped the gate
I'ma fucking storm that you could not escape
You talking smack but we don't get shooken
Ask Lupe, we kick pushing
Will pull your card like we [?]
That's just the shit we do, I'ma boss I be getting loot
Slicker than Jiffy Lube
I been knowing since elementary school
On my momma, god dammit

[Verse 4: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, grinding with a message
Fuck all of my haters and that weak shit y'all requesting
Make we want to grab a fuck nigga by his necklace
DDT up on the stretcher
Even Logic could see that you niggas under pressure
Ok I know the feeling, everyday we see another police killing
Fuck a dirty cop, I'm screaming "Fuck you" if you rolling with him
Put a hole up in him, make me feel like it was formulated
Got me asking "Was this killing color coordinated?" Man I hate it
We want justice not justification
Somebody tell Obama that we done with the waitin'
The system is a gang related organization
Political racism that's still stuck in the stages of hatred
I thought we evolved, now these cameras catching it all
But we haven't, we backtrack, give 'em a reaction
And they wonder why my niggas out here red and blue flagging
Cause they turn us into hashtags the fastest
So I tell em don't paint me black then shoot me dead
Stevie Wonder couldn't see but he could use his legs
Walked on stage, used his head
Now think about it
But nowadays they would rather make a fucking meme about it
They smile and laugh to keep us excited
Not knowing the main focus is to keep us divided
Yo I'm enlightened
They American sniping dudes on the block
You would think these police was Bradley Cooper with the shot, nigga

[Verse 5: Jarren Benton]
Fuck all the shit that you talk, I'm as sick as my thoughts
I'm from Atlanta, I never was a fan of the Hawks
You could find me spitting game in your bitch
Better aim it and spit
Paint the sky with the brains of a snitch
Put your remains in a ditch, I'm getting brains in the six
Reclining the seat, she gon' like the veins on my dick
Them same faggots that clap you up be the same who dap you up
Thank god we made it through days darker than Daffy Duck
Funny how niggas rally when cops kill him
But when black on black violence is through the ceiling, niggas is chilling
I'm passing on the groupie pussy, let my brodies have it
I'm out in Manhattan tryna fuck with  Zoë Kravitz
Fuck love, I ain't searching for no Cinderella
I'm blowing dope then blow my brains in a inner stellar
Rap is resting like the [?]
A little Wayne from the top so I'm rapping like I'm still in the cellar
Lord Benton, women
I'm spilling Pinot gris on my lenin in Venice
CIA invented crack with a sinister chemist
Long talks with God so my spirits can plenish
Listen, I do this for your grandson whose life was taken by a crooked pig behind a handgun
Y'all fucking with Mr. Benton is ludicrous
Slice open my wrist and pull out the devil's computer chip

[Verse 6: Hopsin]
I'm more than hot bro, you saying Hopsin's wack
This is not happening today

[Verse 7: Dizzy Wright]
Yo if I'm there and high, I got the power, I'm prepared to die
Plotting on me, I leave you paralyzed
Stomp you in a pair of nines
They two faced it and I'm too wasted
Covered in blood and now he terrified, well now it's on my shoe laces
And I got your bitch by the pool waiting
Patient taking photos in Kelvin Clein
I'm so ahead of my time, smoking the best that you could find around
Rockin' new, shout out to the stores out in China Town
Wipe me down
Follow no trash, you niggas is ass
I'm taking daps out of cylical glass
Hippy shit, get it and get a sponsorship
With a bitch that'll would knock you out with a Roudy Ronda hit
It's guaranteed, my Dizzy OG hit the county lit
Canabis for the common sense, collecting it ain't no counterfit,I'm confident
Niggas be nominated and non-chalant with it
Me, I just high times the shit and see how long the lines could get
I go line for line for this
Never mind the bitch, out here signing tits
Took a couple shots so shit, I'm kind of lit
Shots at this fuck nigga like he only here cause the condom ripped
I'm just writing on some Queen Latifa comic shit
[?] got me in lab like a scientist
Nigga, nigga, Funk Volume nigga

[Verse 8: Hopsin]
I'm more than hot bro, Hop was born to drop flows
I shoot vids with [?] of vatos like George Orozco
Rabbits get flatlined like singers with [?]
I don't get slept on, it's hard to ignore Picasso
Keep talking your shit, my pockets are thick
Like Robin, I'm slick
You couldn't see me with binoculars bitch
Niggas all up on my DMs like "Hopsin I'm sick"
They asking me to put 'em on like an Oculus Rift
Niggas that do this, don't make tell you this more than once
I'm on it early like Dizzy is with his morning blunts
FV comes together, we moving sick like an orchestra
SwizZz is out ill so at the moment there's four of us
You a liar for ever saying I ain't the greatest
I been inside the hyperbolic time chamber training
Rap super saiyan got your crew complaining
When the nuke is raisen
Homie two can play at this game, this is my rude invasion
You tryna floss on me, buddy I fit right in
Soon as I got some money, I made me some rich white friends
They show me how to save and get taxes back on what I spend
Ain't got no Lambo but if I wanted to, I could buy ten
I'm forever ill everlasting you can't [?]
This rap shit, I got it covered like Sway's dreadlocks
