[Verse 1: Liquid Assassin]
This industry ain't ready for a nigga like me to get up in it and burn it down
Give me that cut like surgeon's now
I don't give a fuck like virgin's now
I just want my opportunity to kill a beat
When I murder tracks with verbs and nouns
Sixteens, I'm surging rounds
Burstin', lay a mothafuckin' serpent down
I got the entity to level my enemies
Dealin' with energy that can undo everything, mentally
Ain't no remedy for testing me, disrespecting me
Effort is evidently not evident in your efforts, B
Tech can tell you we can't believe that you ever speak
Give me any beat cause I'm beastin' on anything
And I'm killing every record
I'm never neglected
I severe these records
I'm [?] second on everything
I go beastmode when I spit flows
C-4 heat blow when the beat go
C-notes's get low then I Deebo
Reload speeds cold when I freak shows
I be on that other shit
Creep slow (creep slow)
When I grind got the streets so
We ride, we roll
We fly, we know
We ride
Beastmode

[Hook]
We ride, we we roll
We we fly, we we know
We we ride
We we beastmode
[?]
We ride, we we roll
We we fly, we we know
We we ride
We we beastmode
[?]

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
You know who it is when I'm spitting this mad shit
Yo, it's Hopsin and Liquid Assassin
Finna get in yo ass
I got a verbal Tommy gun and I'm itching to blast it
Leave you stiff in the casket
I got tricks up my sleeve and different attractions
We can end up being buddies and maybe collaborate
Or we can end up with you gettin' your ass kicked
Or we stippin' yo' bad bitch
Fuck her then pass her around to the niggas I rap with
I don't be giving a fuck
I crush on any wack ass nigga
I ain't givin' no chances
Tell me, do you wanna step to this
The West presents, the new lyrical exorcist
So don't expect nothing less than this
'Cause I'm the best to spit
I'm number one, all the rest are shit
You can ask my mama
With most MC's, I got a bad persona
Nigga my ass is kinda roudy
I'm eatin' mothafucka's like a mad piranha
I bring pain like a sword
You better remember the name like it was yours
I was raised up to be shameless and of course
My flow is like a match just lit in front of your brain and I torch it, 'cause
