[Chorus]
You're so unfair for taking control of me
You must not know how angry I can get
You run away, you’re draining my soul from me
You must not know how angry I can get


[Verse 1]
Yeah, you're fair to me, treat me like a tragedy
Treat me like you're mad at me but I can’t care to be-
Somebody you do love cause I had enough
You tell me you care but I know it's all a bluff

Yeah, you stare at me, admire me, and literally-
Tell me who I am, but it's really the dopamine
Built up in my system from all the pills and-
If you come back again I'm gonna scream

But what's it matter right? All I say is reconstructed
Transformed to some dumb shit then kinda split
Blown outta proportion Shot out like an abortion
Then what came out originally is all distorted

Now they believe you, I'm a bad person
My name will now worsen so I'm here cursin'
And now as I lay in bed I think for certain
If I write this verse then I won’t be yearning

Your disappearance, there’s not evidence so I think
Leavin' your mouth shut will cause nothin’ serious

Dang


[Chorus]
You're so unfair for taking control of me
You must not know how angry I can get
You run away, you're draining my soul from me
You must not know how angry I can get
