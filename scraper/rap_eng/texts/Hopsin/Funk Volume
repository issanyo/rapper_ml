[Intro: Computer & Hopsin]
Sir, our data base has crashed
Aww fuck! Computer, find out what reliable sources we have to maintain a stable ground until we get things moving again
Funk Volume: Haywire
Well send him down there!
How soon?
Now!

[Verse 1: SwizZz]
Ye-uhh! See I coulda been an academic (What?)
Remain in college, study a broad, maybe build some extra credits (Okay)
Get a degree from the UC, get accepted
By my family an friends, finally get respected
But beer pong and flip cup couldn't do it (Nope)
And academic probation just labelled me a loser (Yeah)
Counselors swear they gon' boot ya, terminate your future
If you don't start performing like ya used to
Well hows's this for a motherfuckin' performance
Thought about the state of hip-hop and started exploring
Hipsters, backpackers, fake thugs pose as rappers
What's next? FV evolved to destroy you bastards
And I ain't taking shots, it's just what it is
I'm the truth like verdad, this is SwizZz
It's here now, Funk Volume, fuck all you
I'm hoggin' the rock, come get the ball loose

[Hook: SwizZz & Hopsin]
If you want it, come get it, you know we got it
These niggas hop on the train, the moment we go and drop it
(Oh yeah)
The same niggas thats keepin' you out of pocket
Don't worry about it, we got it, acknowledge we here
It's Funk Volume
If you want it, come get it, you know we got it
These niggas hop on the train, the moment we go and drop it
(Ye-uhh)
The same niggas thats keepin' you out of pocket
Don't worry about it, we got it, acknowledge we here
It's Funk Volume

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
I got a story, kick up off both of your sneakers
Smoke on some reefer, listen, hip-hop sold his soul to the reaper
Ohh it gets deeper, decent image, lyrics, no one did neither
I listened to it but wound up punching a hole in the speaker
MCs puffin' and poutin', like they strugglin' from drownin'
They hate the state of rap, but don't ever do nothing about it
They strategize but it usually is wrong, Mama told me I'ma soon be the one
That'll hit this bitch just like a nuclear bomb
I've spent a minute tryna master the craft
Paving an extravagant path to baffle yo ass
I don't see any more obstacles I have to get past
Looks like there's a whole new type beginning after the trash
Try to duplicate, you'll never find the math that I stash
The movement is happening fast, I sit back and just laugh
Your love and passion is cash, and that's the fact that I'm mad
You'll get your abdomen gashed, and then get stuffed inside my travelling bag

[Hook: SwizZz & Hopsin]
If you want it, come get it, you know we got it
These niggas hop on the train, the moment we go and drop it
(Oh yeah)
The same niggas thats keepin' you out of pocket
Don't worry about it, we got it, acknowledge we here
It's Funk Volume
If you want it, come get it, you know we got it
These niggas hop on the train, the moment we go and drop it
(Ye-uhh)
The same niggas thats keepin' you out of pocket
Don't worry about it, we got it, acknowledge we here
It's Funk Volume

[Verse 3: SwizZz & Hopsin]
It's Funk Volume, turn it up
I know you heard I'm nuts, but trust me, I ain't got the burner tucked
But I do got the urge to bust
You wanna front, you can play the back seat like the runner up
Grindin' till my loot is stacked, bang this till the roof collapse
Enemies, I'm used to that, I'm known for my abusive acts
It's painful where this music's at, let me drive, you relax
I'ma pick the pieces up to this puzzle and glue it back
Please forgive me if my music don't relate to you (Sorry)
My life's a jungle, I'm just actin' how an ape would do
Am I sane, partially, half man, part deceased
White eyes, market me, FV, start some beef

[Hook: SwizZz & Hopsin]
If you want it, come get it, you know we got it
These niggas hop on the train, the moment we go and drop it
(Oh yeah)
The same niggas thats keepin' you out of pocket
Don't worry about it, we got it, acknowledge we here
It's Funk Volume
If you want it, come get it, you know we got it
These niggas hop on the train, the moment we go and drop it
(Ye-uhh)
The same niggas thats keepin' you out of pocket
Don't worry about it, we got it, acknowledge we here
