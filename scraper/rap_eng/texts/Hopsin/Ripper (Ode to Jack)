[Chorus]
So in my mind we're fucking
In my mind we grinding
In my mind still unwinding
I had to rip her, rip her, sick like the ripper, the ripper
In my mind we grinding, grinding
Still unwinding, I had to rip her, rip her
Sick like the ripper, the ripper

[Verse 1: ET]
Nah, I'm not a rapist, some prefer the word sadist
I'm not a satanist, more like a psycho with problems is blatant shit
You're the reason I'm dangerous, tight jeans & stockings, inside I scream
Wet dreams, more like a tease, from this teen, knife to the spleen
You won't give it up to me, girl you actin Teila tequila
I think your ass been sippin' too many margaritas
Well it was nice to meet ya, and since I'm the undertaker
Its tombstone time, you stop breathin'
Hands to the throat, chokin', neck starts bleeding
The weapons done, and nah I don't own guns
But I've seen enough horror flicks to get you done, hun, sprung

[Chorus]
So in my mind we're fucking
In my mind we grinding
In my mind still unwinding
I had to rip her, rip her, sick like the ripper, the ripper
In my mind we grinding, grinding
Still unwinding, I had to rip her, rip her
Sick like the ripper, the ripper

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
See I was at home when I thought of a master invention
Change my image up for a girl to grab her attention
Hell I thought she would be bagged in an instant
But it didn't work out so I resorted to disaster intentions
It was like somebody handed me a bag of resentment
I ran up on her, pushed her on the ground and dragged her against it
I said "Look bitch I'm not gonna hurt you or try to cut you
I just wanna love you" and all she had to say was "FUCK YOU"
I said "No no, please don't make me angry, I'm gonna stab you
And make your veins bleed, you can ask my mother I'm a strange breed
Prematurely born, 8 weeks, I'm a nice guy you should date me
If I had you inside my life I would be so complete"
But she don't agree, she just said no and screamed
Woe is me, after what I did I have a right to be sore
All I can say is that she's not alive anymore!

[Chorus]
So in my mind we're fucking
In my mind we grinding
In my mind still unwinding
I had to rip her, rip her, sick like the ripper, the ripper
In my mind we grinding, grinding
Still unwinding, I had to rip her, rip her
Sick like the ripper, the ripper

[Verse 3: ET]
I came here to address these points, fools getting caught
Snobby bitches getting annoyed, so do you get the point?
Or are you too high off the joint? Girl
These stab wounds multiply in your world
Yeah, they all plural
I don't kill for the thrill, its for the nerds with the mills
Still but no ladies to chill, its ill
I don't find enjoyment, I find employment
Slice a prostitute in the loins quick
Moist grips, firmness, drooling from my lips
See the ripper can't be ripped, on his own shit
Self [??] yeah i ride my own dick

[Chorus]
So in my mind we're fucking
In my mind we grinding
In my mind still unwinding
I had to rip her, rip her, sick like the ripper, the ripper
In my mind we grinding, grinding
Still unwinding, I had to rip her, rip her
Sick like the ripper, the ripper
