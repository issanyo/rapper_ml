(Verse 1: M.I.K.3)
Hey Rachel I heard u being whore last time
I check you're sucking dick so bitch you wanted to get wreck
On one dick to the next but I'm the real Dex
There a reason why I wanted you dead bitch you committed
Treason I would hunt you down I like it was open season sorry Kidar
I'm not teasing there's nothing inside her but demons
I want you to get you gutted have your blood came out
And flooded I'll have my fist bust you lip until I break my wrist
And I would add you to my kill list and I decide you're fate I never knew
How much I could hate until I met you damn I hope you get raped
You're always acting Chris Brown on a fucking date she will tie you up after you take
The bait Fool she ain't cool she a slut and she likes getting dick in her butt

(Chorus: Hopsin)
Pow you feel that led smoke Pow Pow there go your legs broke Nigga where your head go?

(Verse 2: M.I.K.3)

(Chorus: Hopsin)
Pow you feel that led smoke Pow Pow there go your legs broke Nigga where your head go? Pow you feel that led smoke Pow Pow there go your legs broke Nigga where your head go?
