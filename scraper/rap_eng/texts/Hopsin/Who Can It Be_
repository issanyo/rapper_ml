[Hook]
Who fright you in your dreams, tell me who can it be?
Who's got the shit on lock, but doesn't have a key?
They think he's tight, and all the kids like him
He knows he's fly, 'cause all the girls like him
His name is Hopsin

[Verse 1]
I'll be that nigga who get that loose when a zip come through
Droppin' that funky shit on the regular's what I meant to do
Niggas be thinkin' I'm illiterate 'cause I ain't finish school
Talkin' 'bout he an animal, that nigga belong in the zoo
I prolly do but I gotta do what I gotta do
Why do you think I'm hoppin' through obstacles that are hard to do
All of you motherfuckers who talkin' really and startin' to get me started
And I'm gettin' to the point I'ma slaughter you
Psych, I just like to play like I'm a psycho
That's why every place I go I just look suspicious so they know
Before they go and talk to me, niggas possibly spark somethin'
Up in my brain and, I can just flip and go out and start somethin'
That's why they leave me in [?], they  know I'm a crazy man
Think I need to tone it down, 'cause I don't get no ladies, man
Nigga started back in the day when I was a baby, man
Maybe I should just stop it, 'cause everybody hate me, man

[Verse 2]
I'm more than scary, I'm mightier than ordinary
Extraordinary, and horror galores, hard to bear me
I'm the nigga all the hoes are married, it's mind-boggling
But if you ask 'em about it then they'll deny all of it
You ain't gotta like my style but you're drawn to it
Rap ain't workin' out for you, then you should try college then
You're lying if you say I'm not the man
Got the game pocketed, murder niggas and remain anonymous
I ain't a hater, dawg, I bang a lot of shit
Up inside my tape deck, if the shit's wack I take it out of it
'Cause I'm tired of it, you niggas soft like some cartilage
Me evolve in rap homie, you don't want a part of it
I run around slaughtering, clobbering, stop bothering
Y'all got me yelling on the mic, so much of slobbering
Want magic in the booth, call Harry Potter then
Huh, look at the situation I got 'em in

[Break]
Hopsin, Hopsin, Hopsin, Hopsin, Hopsin, Hopsin
Hopsin, Hopsin, Hopsin, Hopsin, Hopsin, Hopsin

[Verse 3]
I'm not an illusion, where's my brain? How did I lose it?
And how the fuck do I be jottin' my music?
Yeah don't be gossip and stupid, the microphone I show how to abuse it
Without no bullshit idiotic excuses
I'm a straight ill nigga, you and I knew this shit
Dope since I with the hella unified school district
Step to me upon the mic, then you will die doin' it
Word to describe me, you should try "Lunatic"
