[Verse 1: Hopsin]
I talk shit and rip beats I'm a true MC
The only one who tells me what to do is me

I'm past basic, in my eyes I have made it
Came along way from mom and dad's basement
When I do shows now the women strip me half naked
My bad language got me buzzing like I'm mad famous
Now labels think about signing me, damn
MTV has got their eye on me, damn
Shoebbdy dobbey wow, I still ain't giving fucks
So if I hurt your feelings tell it to your diary
Nigga I'm so beast rhyming on cold beats
Finally shining without the diamonds and gold teeth
The high empire trying to bring firin on me
So I keep my guards up, when I'm tired I don't sleep

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Fuck man that was all I had, that was all I wrote
But yo now I'm 'bout to choke
Choke like I got a fucking rock up in my throat
Nah not a cock up in my throat not a fucking homo
Yo I'mma spit some lines jut for some promo
Knock Madness, the single this Sunday
Hopsin up on the runway
Yo I swear to god that I'mma blow one day
Yo this shit is kinda wack but it fun hey (hey)
