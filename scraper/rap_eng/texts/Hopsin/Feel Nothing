[Verse 1: J Sutta]
I can't believe that you're making a fool of me
I saw with my eyes something I shoulda never seen

[Pre-Chorus: J Sutta]
Now, now
You, you wanna come in
Tryna convince me
That you don’t remember, 'member
I’m tryna forget
That all of your kisses
Can make it any better (better)

[Chorus: J Sutta]
Feel you trying hard
But in my heart I feel nothing, I feel nothing
With your hands all over me
Honestly, I feel nothing, I feel nothing
Thought I’d give you one moment
To touch me everywhere you know I like
I know you keep trying hard
But in my heart I feel nothing, I feel nothing

[Verse 2: J Sutta]
I try to forget but I can’t take it off my mind
(Off my mind, can't get you off my mind)
And you say that you're sorry
I wanna put this behind (put this behind)

[Pre-Chorus: J Sutta]
Now, now
You, you wanna come in
Tryna convince me
That you don’t remember, 'member
I’m tryna forget
That all of your kisses
Can make it any better (better)

[Chorus: J Sutta]
Feel you trying hard
But in my heart I feel nothing, I feel nothing
With your hands all over me
Honestly, I feel nothing, I feel nothing
Thought I’d give you one moment
To touch me everywhere you know I like
I know you keep trying hard
But in my heart I feel nothing, I feel nothing

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
Baby, let me talk to you
Why you so delusional
There's a few things you should know, girl, you're beautiful
See I ain't even tryna lose you though
You making me do things I ain't do before
This life I'm in is hard and I can't get lost
I'm tryna tell you, but I don't get a chance to talk
You giving foul looks, 'cause you feelin' bruised and hurt
But you don't even know the deal, you assume the worst
See I can understand that, I’d probably do the same thing
All of your friends telling you that you should blame me
Find another man who appreciates you
Lots of niggas begging on their knees to date you
This I know, if I go
I'ma have your back regardless, baby, it's my oath
Love, pain, I'm guessing we got hit by both
But I don't wanna lose you

[Chorus: J Sutta]
Feel you trying hard
But in my heart I feel nothing, I feel nothing
With your hands all over me
Honestly, I feel nothing, I feel nothing
Thought I’d give you one moment
To touch me everywhere you know I like
I know you keep trying hard
But in my heart I feel nothing, I feel nothing
