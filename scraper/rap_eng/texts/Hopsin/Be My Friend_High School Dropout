[Verse 1]
I never had a lot of hope
I looked above and God had spoke
And said I'm only here because my daddy's fuckin' condom broke
Did I ever go to college? (Nope)
And even got no job for dough
I'm looked upon like I'm a joke
Cuz this the shit that I promote
The Ill Mind Of Hopsin!
Where real life's an option!
The ill lines that I spit make you realize you're not sick!
Science at its finest tell Bill Nye to watch it
Now turn this shit the fuck up till you feel high and nauseous
You fake thug rappers be frontin' like you was born with Glocks
But only time you ever bang is when the door is locked
Nigga with attitude just without the S curl
I break rappers like promises with my ex girl
I'm kinda strange
And I been this way since a young age
The biggest book I've read was less than one page
I've always had slump grades
Never use a condom like I want AIDS
A nutcase, I'll smash your fuckin' dreams like a pugs face

[Hook]
I'm a high school drop out
Still living at my moms house (My moms house) (Oh yeah!)
I talk shit and get knocked out
My life sucks and I'm not proud
Ohhh do you wanna be my friend
I would love to be your friend
Come on then
Do you wanna be my friend
I would love to be your friend
Come on then

[Verse 2]
My life's lame, I gotta pay money to fuck a whore
I couldn't pull a damn anorexic bitch in a tug of war
I'm sick of big headed niggas feeling above the lord
Somebody please give Soulja Boy the "You Suck" award!
Out of all the styles you just had to pick the wack shit
Hopsin won't attack you if you practice
You faggot little bastard
I never would have imagined this would happen
I should fuckin' power drive your ass into a cactus
Yo, the game's mine, go rule you own
I got a foolish zone
I'm a schitzo who carpools alone
Relax this is the music that I make for maniacs
Who can't adapt with the rest, now watch the chain react
The worlds cold, open your mouth and let me come inside
I diss the fuck outta rappers its cuz I wanna die
I never face my problems
Shit I always run from mine
I fucked my life up, now I'm tryin' to give your son a try

[Hook:]

[Verse 3]
Yo, I come from a land where the kids fail
It's a sick hell
So if you're frightened by my lyrics and looks bitch yell
Brainwashed, by Slim Shady and D12
Crooked, Ludacris, Missy Elliot, Big L
Well, y'all know Hopsin, but let me explain who Marcus is
I make inspiration for music for the retarded kids
Who suffer from Parkinson's
Whose bodies have parts missin'
Cuz in Special Ed you really don't know how hard it is
You know I've always been a know-it-all
I thought that when I'd grow up tall
I'd get pussy and not be using blow up dolls
I want more hoes
I can't control my hormones
I'm always watchin' pornos in the bedroom with the door closed
Whoa! Hey Hopsin!
Stop with the mental hacker games
You've already brainwashed our son, Alexander James
He's only half your age, and now he masturbates
His whole perspective on the things that really matter changed

[Hook]
