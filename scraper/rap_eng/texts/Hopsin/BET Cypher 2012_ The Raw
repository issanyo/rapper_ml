[Verse 1: Jaybird the Purdy Boi]
Never thought I'd be rappin' on the cypher, this a blessin'
Never thought I'd be rappin' for Premier, this cat's a legend
Never thought I'd get picked out the whole country by Khaled
To rap on BET, guess he saw me as the best man
619 to 858 to 760 I'm reppin'
San Diego to all you foreign, Daygo's what we call it
Shout out to all the haters watchin' this
Eat a plate of blue waffle disease
Drink some water with some AIDS mix
I got lines that Holly hookers wanna sniff
Flow is poetic justice, make Janet recite the lyrics I spit
Who hotter than me? You hotter than who?
All Eyez On Me, I'm way 2Pac-er than you
Man I murder beats for a living, I murder the competition
Celebrate it, dancin' like Serena at the olympics
Y'all put me on national TV, thinkin' I wouldn't show out?
Man I'mma take over like Jay-Z, I'mma rock out

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Grab your Slurpee and popcorn, I'm bout to make it hot for 'em
They didn't even invite me to this shit, man I just walked on
If I didn't come, then every bit of hope for rap is all gone
I'm ill, in the past you thought I wasn't, but you thought wrong
"Hop I lost respect for you, I'm pissed and you just lost a fan
All you do is diss, I'll never bump your album "Raw" again"
If what I say gets on your last nerve, then holla man
But truth is, y'all can't touch me like Pac's hologram
Don't dare to try it if you scared of dyin'
I'm terrifyin', the real Boogie Man, who even got your parents hidin'
When you're sleeping, I'll find your window, and just stare inside it
I'm a animal, momma raised me inside a lair with lions
Prepare for violence, Funk Volume's an unfair alliance
We embarrass giants, and rip mic's till we get laryngitis
My wave's sitting like a sandstorm, and I know what you mad for
Cause I'm living my dream, and yours

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Dropped out of school and became richer
Retired from the pliers, kept balling like I'm a Clipper
Black hoodies, black bitches and black Benzes
She know these chains fit, so now she want my forensics
Got love for my city, shout out to Kendrick
October 22nd, the album, so go and get it
Look, turn a good kid to wig city, I serve plenty
Shoot 'til the chamber and clip empty, that's real crippy
Have a shirt, and my knuckles smothered with hate powder
Die and go to hell, and have the devil getting higher
How ironic that we smoking fire, gangsta rap Messiah
Mid-20's but 20 racks an hour
Bucket hats and designer beans, the Bosselini
Young slimmy, your chance see me?, your chance skinny
(?) placed rappers get paid pennies
A million off of tour this year because of all this talk about Romney
Iffy, Puffy

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
My flow is captivating, Magic Chick is watching this and masturbating
Basket cases, spitting in yo picnic, better pack a lunch
Chop 'em down, bag 'em up, Bill Murray, Daffy Duck
Yeah my squad the illest, y'all a little fishy, halibut
Chickens acting ratchet get split open with this hatchet
We the kids that causing racket with that automatic riot shit
Irises is violent, air balloon, we high as heck
Play the violin, fucking models wearing Iverson's
This my moment, don't blow it like my old chick
You the type to still tuck your shirt behind your phone clip
Whoa, and I think I might need a lawyer
Hov bout to have me killed for trying to talk to Rita Ora
I'm sorry that's just extra there
I'm going crazy like Clint Eastwood iat the empty chair
Keep your eyes peeled, running through a mine field
Even Lord Finesse will tell you I'm ill

[Verse 5: Mystikal]
Mystikal flex your style on em, transform and get wild on em
Growl at em, "Rah"
Trukfit nigga you a monster, you out the attic
Yeah scare a nigga, "Rah"
I sit your stupid ass down wherever on the side
Let a real nigga back in this bitch, get it live
Off of that performance, y'all might consider a different job
That ain't gon' cut it partna, at least you tried
How many niggas can't spell live cause they tired?
Some of them think that they the shit but they not
Move to the Shakers, make it happen when they pound
Hustles out to get it bustin', layin' on they side
Big Truck, Cash Money rapping Baboon
Ya auntie and ya momma know bout that (?) fool
Your grandpa and your grandma heard that (?) rule
White boys and white girls gon' buy that (?)
