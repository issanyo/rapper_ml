Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah, I’m a psycho
I guess I’m a psycho

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You’re crazy! I like you, but you’re crazy
My tours paid me, so I used that dough to allure ladies
To manure bathe me
Never that, my mind's for sure shady
Pure Hades, Rev X said that he couldn’t endure to save me
Why do I let this stripper burn me on my arm with a cigarette in the same spot ten times in a row?
When I felt that burn, I palm the clitoris, I'ma get her wet
Sorry to get carried away
I feel stupid 'cause I ain’t did her yet
Maybe she never let a fine nigga stare at her breasts
I get vexed so N9ne bit her neck
Open! I try to contain it, but that dame thang’s soakin'
Alter ego say: "Why you let them gangbang folk in?"
Strange Lane hopin' I can maintain copin'
But ain’t nobody talkin' when the insane mane spoken
I like fire on my skin, blood on my draws
From up on her walls, I’m sufferin', I’m stuck in her claws
Stuffed in her jaws, huffin' and puffin', hollerin', I'm a dog
Afterwards I like really hot scaldin' water on my balls

[Hook: Tech N9ne, Hopsin & B.o.B]
Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah, I’m a psycho
I guess I’m a psycho

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Mom? Dad? I’m no longer the boy you're used to seein'
I’ve changed a lot, plus I’ve grown to hate every human bein'
My mood swings have now turned
My dreams into gruesome scenes
Now I’m doin' things I don’t normally do when illusion seem
To be the only pleasures I can gain
Heck, if I was sane I would've put down the mic
And said, "Fuck it, I'll never rise to fame."
But with the wicked wreckage I contain
I could probably jeopardize your name
No lovey-dovey, let’s ignite the flame
If you’re lucky you'll survive the pain
Sorry, that ain't very merry to say
Why is this game so scary to play?
Well, let me think, 'cause every day
My balls are gettin' too hairy to shave
Pause a minute, I'm stressin' again
If I go to Hell, then Heaven's to blame
I don’t mean to come off crazy
But you mothafuckas seem to think I’m hella deranged
When I was seven years old
I fell on my head and I severed my brain
If you think I’m lyin', then ask my mama
Nigga, she'll go tell you the same—
Should I be ashamed? No
I’m livin' my life so ghetto fabulous
Before you get bent out of shape
My nigga, let me ask you this

[Hook: Tech N9ne, Hopsin & B.o.B]
Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah, I’m a psycho
I guess I’m a psycho

[Verse 3: Jester]
I will cut your daddy’s throat, wearin' a Michael mask
Every direction I go, I'm followin' this psychopath
Tortured bastards like animals, I was raised in Myers past
Tellin' myself I'm fuckin normal, lookin' through a liars glass
I will cut your brothers gut, wearin' a Jason mask
Lookin' for intestines, breath I'm chasin' last
Nobody wanted to play with me, I'ma Voorhees outcast
Disturbed if you can't fuckin' tell, be told by my horror stories in class
I will cut your sisters pussy, wearin’ a Freddy mask
Finger fuckin with razors, go bloody steady in the bath
Dreams can't come true, I'm your worst nightmare Kruger's wrath
Don't lock the door, put down the crucifix, should a fuckin' intruder have to ask
I will cut your fiances face, wearin' a Thomas mask
Hang him out to dry, bitch I kept my promise you last
Chasin' you through fields, across the Sawyer lawn through the Hewitt grass
I'm not gonna fuckin do it fast

[Hook: Tech N9ne, Hopsin & B.o.B]
