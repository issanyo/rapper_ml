Okay, uhh
Stupid part, this is the part where I fuck it all up
And it's on youtube, and everybody's like "This fool is whack as shit
He don't practice shit, run up to his show and fucking smack his dick
He fucking sucks, and his album fucking sucks
And I can't believe I fucking paid twenty bucks for this shit
And I want all of my fucking money back"
I catch my fucking career like a running back
(?)
Best believe I'm chilling on your couch "what's up?"
I'm on the motherfucking show to fucking (?)
Yeah, fuck with bitches if the bitch blow
Eh, give me head and she doing well
Yeah, Hopsin and I'm going-.. **mumbles**

This is stupid, this is why I don't fucking rap
This is why I don't like rapping on this track
I'm whack, and nigga best believe that I'm black
What you saying, best believe, nigga rest in peace
Yo **mumbles**
And I suck, I can't do it
No no, fuck that, fuck that
Nigga going there, going there three times
I'm spitting neat rhymes, and I'm knee high
Nigga highlight five three
PC is where you find me
I don't smoke trees but still act crazy
Fuck my album, niggas too lazy
It don't faze me, where's my testicles?
I think I left the fucking in Mexico
Mexico? Why did I even say that?
Everything I say is whack, nigga better (?)
(?) next time you see me, on the TV
Je heez, o la la la, wee wee
