[Intro: J.Smitty]
You know why is that while most of you all don't take me serious enough
Everybody else is taking me way too fuckin' seriously
I don't get it

[Hook: J.Smitty]
D-d-don't take-take, d-d-don't take-take
D-d-don't take, d-d-don't take-take
Don't take me so seriously
Don't take me so serious, serious
D-d-don't take-take, d-d-don't take-take
D-d-don't take, d-d-d-d-don't take-take
Don't take me so seriously
Don't take me so serious, serious

[Verse 1: J.Smitty]
Just because I rap, doesn't mean I think I'm hard
I'm a normal dude like you straight disregard
All the bullshit conclusions you came up, we got that are false
I'm a bad motherfucker you keep that in the claws
'Bout to raise to rest, I got to break out the fifth
'Bout to suck some dick, not really but you believin'
This is entertainment and what that means is
Fact or fiction, distinguish between them (Why?)
Must I be like the grim reaper
'Cause I do a song or two about eating ya
Doesn't really mean I wanna cut you up into pieces
Sprinkle you on a pizza
With a blend of three cheeses (Yummy)
And I don't smoke weed no I don't smoke pot
'Cause I'm making that green
Yeah I got a good job
Just because I ain't smokin' the grass
Doesn't mean I can't talk about my past you fast

[Hook: J.Smitty]
D-d-don't take-take, d-d-don't take-take
D-d-don't take, d-d-don't take-take
Don't take me so seriously
Don't take me so serious, serious
D-d-don't take-take, d-d-don't take-take
D-d-don't take, d-d-d-d-don't take-take
Don't take me so seriously
Don't take me so serious, serious

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
How come every time I say some shit
You motherfuckers think I'm sick?
Let the bass drum hit
Scared like I got the napalm lit
Then you run just incase I flip
And if I talk about how many bodies that I leave in a casket
Don't take it so serious, 'cause I'm just being sarcastic
And I don't kill people, there's no reason to ask it
It's pretty obvious, so let's just leave it at that, shit
But no, you wanna pick at it and nag at it
Keep your mouth running faster than a jack rabbit
Ayo, I'm finna develop a new bad habit
Black magic, run up on you and blind you with black fabric
I'm kinda normal but half manic
Because of this wack planet
Assuming that I'm just a bad savage
And I became the dude your momma and dad's mad at it
I'm tryna obtain peace, but it's hard to grasp at it

[Hook: J.Smitty]
D-d-don't take-take, d-d-don't take-take
D-d-don't take, d-d-don't take-take
Don't take me so seriously
Don't take me so serious, serious
D-d-don't take-take, d-d-don't take-take
D-d-don't take, d-d-d-d-don't take-take
Don't take me so seriously
Don't take me so serious, serious

[Verse 3: J.Smitty]
Just because I rap doesn't mean I'm trying to be black
Have a conversation with me you can fuckin' see that
I'm a normal white boy, you're a fuckin tea bag
Talking all that bullshit would make you fuckin' bleacher
I'm a normal guy trying to work 9 to 5
Trying to make it on this living, get by live life
If you think you gon' get in the way of how I live
Bitch take a second listen to the red neck skits
Sure me and you are little bit different
Does it really give you the right to be belligerent
Everything you saying to me, insignificant
Take a fuckin' millisec, sit back to chillin' bitch
Droppin' that chair' when I'm thinking like a little kid
Get your pop in the same thing you just opened
Writing poems as about as white it gets
But when I turn my poetry into rap I'ma nail

[Hook: J.Smitty]
D-d-don't take-take, d-d-don't take-take
D-d-don't take, d-d-don't take-take
Don't take me so seriously
Don't take me so serious, serious
D-d-don't take-take, d-d-don't take-take
D-d-don't take, d-d-d-d-don't take-take
Don't take me so seriously
Don't take me so serious, serious
