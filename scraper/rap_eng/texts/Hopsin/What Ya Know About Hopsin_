[Verse 1]
I flow them words that hits you like smokin' herbs
Convince you to throw them birds since you so disturbed
I won't even bother with dissin' you on a verse
My Hennessy went in worse, my niggas be on alert
I'll have you on your knees sittin' alone in church
When I interrupt on the turf my nigga it's gonna hurt
I guarantee that blood'll be leakin' up on your shirt
I sock you into a casket and send you into the earth
Oh snap looks like he ain't what he thought he'd be
Thought he could slaughter me rawly, the orders where we all be
Vicious is just a part of me, leave the hitman then call on me
And follow me as I'm causin' this rage be involved wit' me
It's all a mystery how I make flawless victories
From splittin' wigs and leavin' a shiny and bald like Mr. Clean
My style is fresher than niggas who swallow Listerine
I'll have you begging for life, the rest is all in history

[Hook]
Man! What y'all niggas know about Hopsin?
Nothing! we just know he always drop hot shit
C'mon fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up, bust 'em up, bust 'em up
Cut 'em up, cut 'em up, shut 'em up, shut 'em up
Man! What y'all know about Hopsin?
Nothing! they just know I always drop hot shit
Hopsin gon' make it hot, wack niggas shake the spot
Why the fuck y'all niggas stalling, time to get this party started

[Verse 2]
For nigga think he tired I just feel like I gotta diss him
Put him on blast nigga 'cause Hopsin know to whip him
Make that nigga cry ocean 'til his momma get him
And if you wanna take it to the streets you know I'm boxing with him
When it to comes to fighting Hopsin got a lot of victims
Since elementary school I was anxious to sock and kick 'em
Hang around me long enough and you can even witness the field
But once you hear the (whoopsie) I'm gonna (finish him)
It ain't Mortal Kombat it's combat of mortals
You get whoopty woos by me not Jax or Goro
I smack the cornrow right off the top of your dome
Instead of popping the chrome leave you dazed off in the zone
Hopsin is sick with the provocative flow
I'm as solid as bones and if you sit talk in my throne
I wouldn't bother to answer with that knock of the door
You wind up missing in the woods and nobody you'll know

[Hook]
Man! What y'all niggas know about Hopsin?
Nothing! we just know he always drop hot shit
C'mon fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up, bust 'em up, bust 'em up
Cut 'em up, cut 'em up, shut 'em up, shut 'em up
Man! What y'all know about Hopsin?
Nothing! they just know I always drop hot shit
Hopsin gon' make it hot, wack niggas shake the spot
Why the fuck y'all niggas stalling, time to get this party started

[Verse 3]
I'm dangerous, gaffled this shit and my name [?]
My venom is angry, my adrenaline ain't weak
If a nigga fuck around I'ma get him the same week
Why you act raw when you niggas is mainly
Like a fresh pack of lemurs 'cause your limit'll spray sleeps
Wack life act like you living the crazy
Let me tell you something you criminals ain't g's
'Cause when Hopsin come around your women is ain't shizzin'
Quick to dump you know chicks'll run
[?]
Your old Hopsin a monster
Quick as thunder, whip you under two seconds flat
Niggas like whose flesh is that
Don't test this cat you're best as [?]
Your gats are weak you be falling fast asleep
I'ma deck you so hard, I'ma crack your teeth
And let my homies have a piece to smash the beat

[Hook]
Man! What y'all niggas know about Hopsin?
Nothing! we just know he always drop hot shit
C'mon fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up, bust 'em up, bust 'em up
Cut 'em up, cut 'em up, shut 'em up, shut 'em up
Man! What y'all know about Hopsin?
