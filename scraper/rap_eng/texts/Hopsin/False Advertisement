[Verse 1]
Please tell me what the fuck is wrong with these bitches
I'ma tell you right now you ain't worth shit
All you do is sit at home takin' selfies
And post them like it was your work shift
Your 'gram is full of all these evil memes
To niggas lie you don't deserve it
That's why niggas ain't fuckin' with you
'Cause we see that you don't have a purpose
It's clear that you don't leave the house
We date you and don't be aroused
Only pleasure that we ever do get from you
Is when you shut up and open your mouth
Don't you get it stupid bitch it don't matter
If you love a man and you holdin' him down
'Cause once he find out that you got nothing better to
Do except him he won't be around
Y'all like "I want to be treated like I'm a queen"
Bitch better act like one
Girl I got so much to give you
If you ain't givin' back it's a wrap, I'm done
You want a real man, a real boss
So you can live life in a Kodak frame
A real man carry a lot of shit on his shoulder
We need a real woman who can hold that weight
Let me guess you a real woman, right?
Nope don't want to hear that
So go cry some tears in your tear bag
Bitch you don't have a car, a job
A life or a fuckin' career path
There's no accomplishments
I'm serious bitch stop this shit
You can fool niggas with pics lookin' like you a queen
But in real life I know you the opposite

[Pre-Hook]
Bitch I can see what you tryna do
You got niggas outside in a line for you
For that pussy they'll spend it all for you
They got so much they can offer you
And you lovin' it, you strategizing
False advertising, god damn you lovin' it
But I ain't cho mans
Hoe, shut the fuck up!

[Hook]
Nigga these hoes better quit it
Nigga these hoes better quit it (quit it, quit it)
Nigga these hoes better quit it
Damn hoe shut the fuck up

[Verse 2]
Girl why you lyin' to niggas?
Actin' as if your life isn't boring
Yes the pussy was good but that is the
Only highlight of your story
You got these celebrities in your DMs
And you get invited to parties (nice)
Better enjoy it you bitch 'cause all of your
Looks gonna die when you forty
Look at your shit all the guys are absorbing
Hoe I'm talkin' don't try and ignore me
Oh that's your new BMW, right?
I got a couple 'cause I can afford these
You made a hustle off of guys who are horny
Gucci purses, vacations in Fiji
Trynna date you is easy
They just slide you some cash you just lay on the weewee
What the fuck do you stand for?
Everyday you actin' like a damn whore
You be showin' your ass on the dance floor
Niggas throwin' money till their hands sore
Now you handed it all to your landlord
You just hopin' you don't get evicted
I coulda sworn you were livin' way better than this
You just got so many gimmicks (yikes)
I don't get how it don't bother you
Who is the father who fathered you?
Bitch need a belt to that ass
If I was yo daddy that's probably what I would do
This goes out to all these wanna be models
Who flashin' titties just to get a like
Just take this advice: you pathetic, go get a life
You want dough you ain't gettin' mine

[Pre-Hook]
Bitch I can see what you tryna do
You got niggas outside in a line for you
For that pussy they'll spend it all for you
They got so much they can offer you
And you lovin' it, you strategizing
False advertising, god damn you lovin' it
But I ain't cho mans
Hoe, shut the fuck up!

[Hook]
Nigga these hoes better quit it
