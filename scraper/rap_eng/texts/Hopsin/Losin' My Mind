[Hook: Vice Gripp]
Every time I open my eyes yo
I'm feeling homicidal
Quick, someone call the men in the white coats
I-I-I think that I'm losin' my mind
That I'm losin' my mind
I think that I'm losin' my mind
Every time I open my eyes yo
I feel like I'm on trial
Can I not be judged for a while?
I-I-I think that I'm losin' my mind
That I'm losin' my mind
I think that I'm losin' my mind

[Verse 1: Vice Gripp]
I awaken from the slumber
With a hunger
Like no other motherfucker
Or his brother
I swear to God if emcees keep sleeping
I'll turn Freddy Krueger and dare y'all asses to keep dreaming
I feel like nobody wants to see me succeed
It must get under their skin intravenously
So young and coming up within the ranks
If your shit is garbage no wonder your attitude stanks
The walls are crumbling around me
Haters like a circus act how they trying to clown me
Their shit is all make up
But say, bruh
My nature
Is still to verbally cremate ya
I'll kill you if you try to stop my paper
You'll be begging for the gun but I'll use the razor
When I say this homie I am serious
I don't give a fuck about any of you, period

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Vice Gripp]
I need to relax, mane
This damn brain
Of mine is working overtime chasing that change
But I can't and I know
That I won't
Smoke control don't work no more
Lock me up in hospitals
I'm so anxious
I start shaking
And start pacing
Start gazing
Wanting the car faces
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
I'll find out who's your favorite rapper and light him on fire
The ice cracked, I'm past my breaking point
The world made me a psycho, homie, it ain't a choice
I find it necessary that I raise my voice
Cause it's motherfuckers who can't hear me making noise
I ain't getting any motherfucking younger
So while you faggots make it rain I'll make it lightning and thunder
Hell yea fuck 'em let the life spill
Welcome to the underground [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
I think that I'm losing my mind
Here's a few of the signs
No brain was made inside my head, it was glued into mine
Abnormal human design
Thoughts I got two different kinds
I break the law and then have to be told numerous times
Not to violate it, this grievous tumor is why
I find a slight ticklish wicked humor in crime
You'd probably shit inside your panties if you heard the rhymes
I'm certified
These wack rappers deserve to die
I'll grab my tab of enemies and I'll flip through the list
Choose a bitch to bring the karma to and then let loose a bit
Run up to their fucking house and knock, when they say "who is it?"
I say "police!", then run, and when they open up a fuse is lit
This is the day that hell comes
Welcome
I'm-a teach you how to unveil nuns and sell guns
Inhale tons of weed smoke in your frail lungs
Then I'm-a give you a pat on the back and say well done

[Hook]
