[Verse 1]

Man, im so unprepared, and the shit is not fair
I hate rap, I hate my life and I do not care
I got a lot of fucking money, I do not share
I like to eat apples and I like to eat pears
I'm rare, I wear white contacts you see this
You see this fucking dick inside my jeans girl you need this
Oh, who's this? He's Hopsin with the cold flow
I get a lot of videos done by George Orozco
I'm on Instragram talking to the bitches
You diss me and then im coming with the quickness
To rip your ass to pieces, just like some fucking paper
Im spittin' on this microphone, and yeah you feel vapor
Uh, some niggas say I'm Darth Vader
Fuck it, yo I'll see you later
I'm out this bitch, and then I'm back in, I'm rapping
Yo dawg, what happend?
My brain is about to lose this shit, see im a lunatic
I don't even know who you are, yo who is this?
And why are standing on the side to me?
Fuck this shit, yo
Im about to leave, say bye to me
