[Intro: G-Mo Skee]
Yeah
Inf Gang, Hopsin
Look

[Verse 1: G-Mo Skee]
I'm still in the hood like a goddamn Obama Phone
Chip on my shoulder balls full of testosterone
Stop rapping; you niggas sound monotone
Filth master throw you off the roof and break your collar bone
I never left
Who's head should I sever next?
Sell merch to fans: human flesh as a sweater vest
Inf Gang fucked your bitch, gave her better sex
Now she's in a fucking wheelchair with Professor X
Let me explain; I put the pussy on a chainwax
You couldn't rock a houseparty spitting kitten play raps
I've got 'em thinking somebody brought Big Daddy Kane back
And gave him the same crack that made Kurt Cobain snap
I had a long talk with H-O-P
He told me "Stop killing these rappers, stay low key"
I said "Nah fuck that Hop, I make no peace
I'mma kill all these motherfuckers that hate on me"
I'm unfeigned

[Chorus: Hopsin]
I'm unfeigned
Untamed
You can never stop my grind
I know you wanna see a nigga flop
But you're not homie this is my prime
I got my bus filling up these streets
You need some hot shit come and fuck with me
I'm just your average guy
Don't have a disguise
Sit back and just ride with me
Baby

[Verse 2: Katz]
You're approaching an animal; you better take caution
Dirty mind since a child, never fell for the brainwashing
When you see the Inf Gang you better play possum
We crucify motherfuckers: bloodstained crosses
We don't take losses
We only take the wins
These MC's got my patience running paper thin
I'm on tour, on the bus, finna blaze again
Then come home and put my nuts on a hater's chin
Since the land before time the real set the stage
I've been hitting people with the truth since second grade
In the Sahara, with a pride of straight savages
Spot you in person, still I remain adamant
Trying to keep my life pure, you focused on the additives
I'm grinding for the future, you hoping for an accident
I'm always on my toes as the great can fall easy
New legends rising, place your balls here

[Chorus: Hopsin]
I'm unfeigned
Untamed
You can never stop my grind
I know you wanna see a nigga flop
But you're not homie this is my prime
I got my bus filling up these streets
You need some hot shit come and fuck with me
I'm just your average guy
Don't have a disguise
Sit back and just ride with me
Baby

[Verse 3: Twiztid]
I'm not dead
But every day is Halloween
If you know what I mean
I'm picking up one of my clones
Smelling like candy corn liquor and jelly beans




[Chorus: Hopsin]
