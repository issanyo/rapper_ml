(Hopsin: Verse 1)

Some niggas hope that I never make it
Cause fame is a luxury fruit that most niggas want but they probably never gonna ever taste it
There is no hesitation
Hell within my heart fuck an education
You'll regret all the underestimating
I got my blue print laid and
Once my new shits paid
I be the new hit wave
My nigga you just wait
This ain't the realest gibberish I imagine
This shit has been in the works
Mother fucka its happening
My Hustle and grind is allowing my buzz to bubble and shine
Dont be surprised when you hear
My name a couple of times
It's gonna get stuck in your mind
I hope you crumble inside
You hate the fact I leave society so puzzled wit rhyme
So get ready cause the time is here
You thought my eyes would never benefit my career those were your words
If only I could rewind the years
And now you sweatin and showin so many signs of fear

(Hook)
I know you heard I was murderous (MMMH)
Why do you hate me SOO much
I know you heard I was murderous (MMMH)
If there's a problem then let me know
YOUUUUU underestimated me one to many times
And frankly I'm kinda sick of it its time I show
You all what I'm about and how crazy shit can get

(Snypa Da Prophet: Verse 2)

I got tired of all these people tryin to play me
Its funny I was shit 2 years ago but now they download and download together like a puzzle
Slowly I watched it bubble
They ain't thinkin I'd be trouble now they wish I had a muzzle (Ha!)
They used to say i couldn't make it wit ryhmes I'm wasting my time It's sad what a waste of a mind
I had to show what they hatin
Almost way more rare to find and kept pushin
Just to prove to y'all I'm one of kind
And I think its funny how these people act
When your in their presence they kissin ass
When you turn they grab the battle axe
This games full of that
Full of phony raps
So stay focused
Until I notice
I'm cool wit that its finally lookin
Like the time is near with all these people steady hatin
We too busy making progress here
I quickly learned I had to do it on my own fuck all the hate
I'll never turn fake just to get on

(Hook)
I know you heard I was murderous (MMMH)
Why do you hate me SOO much
I know you heard I was murderous (MMMH)
If there's a problem then let me know
YOUUUUU underestimated me one to many times
And frankly I'm kinda sick of it, its time I show
You all what I'm about and how crazy shit can get
