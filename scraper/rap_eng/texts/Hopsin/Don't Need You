[Intro]
K-K-Kato on the track bitch

[Verse 1: Hopsin]
You already know I'm going all in
It ain't hard to see this is my calling
Let's just be honest, over like the past two years
I been running shit but I was only jogging
Haters steady dogging, getting information from the blogging
Kill the bullshit, you better chalk it, thinking that I lost it
I done had my mind on the prize
Back when I was sipping water from the faucet (raw shit)
I'ma fuck around and have to let it loose
I am not the tunnel to be headin' through
I'm on another motherfucking pedestal
I ain't playing with this rap shit
Where he at I'ma split his fucking head in two
Your career has been a lie
You been copping rentals back at enterprise
I ain't never had to go pretend to fly
I could pull up on a bitch inside a fucking Toyota Corolla
And I'm betting you that she go fucking get inside
I ain't even gotta make a sentence rhyme
I ain't go pretend this ain't a genocide
I ain't go pretend my nuts are minimized
I ain't go pretend that I ain't drop knowledge on you back
When I was going heavy when the menace eyes
Y'all ain't got a business mind, y'all don't see the vision I paved
If you go against the grain you're getting penalized
So you better pick a side 'fore I have to go and let the missiles fly
You know I'm only in it just to get the prize, tell 'em

[Pre-Chorus: Evans Desir]
I gotta get it and go
Where were you when I was broke?
Say what's a snake to a bird
Oh yeah that's dinner to go
I got no time to be lollygaggin'
I'm on a mission to blow
You niggas prayed it would never happen
I was just hoping you know

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
I don't really need you (I don't, I guess, old pussy ass nigga)
I don't really need you (yeah)
Nigga I don't really need you (I don't, old pussy ass nigga)
I don't really need you (yeah)
I don't really need you

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
It's funny how niggas act when you down and out
Ay where the fuck were you dog when we were grinding out?
Like I ain't the shit oh you just count him out
I'm back for revenge I needed time to bounce
Back on you niggas like a new ball
Middle finger go up to a couple blogs
And a couple fuck boys talking dumb shit
When they log on they mothers laptop get a spiked bat to your jaw
And I don't give a shit if you came directly from God's dick
I hope your pilot have a seizure in the cockpit
Your plane crash, or a killer hold you hostage
Sodomize you with a broom handle or a mop stick
I hope they beat you in a mosh pit
Bash his fuckin' head with a yard stick
Oh this is what you want, you want that dark shit?
A life will leave a nigga with his heart ripped
Just a while ago it was all smiles
A bunch of fake niggas, dog I'm so proud (I'm proud of you man)
I seen you on a magazine, oh wow (congratulations)
Oh you on Warner nigga you go blow now (yeah)
When Hop said nigga fuck Funk Volume
Then you chumps stopped callin'
And a nigga had to get it on his own
And you bitches didn't bother
Had to get it from the bottom
Where the fuck were you bitch nigga?

[Pre-Chorus: Evans Desir]
I gotta get it and go
Where were you when I was broke?
Say what's a snake to a bird
Oh yeah that's dinner to go
I got no time to be lollygaggin'
I'm on a mission to blow
You niggas prayed it would never happen
I was just hoping you know

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
I don't really need you (I don't, I guess, old pussy ass nigga)
I don't really need you (yeah)
Nigga I don't really need you (I don't, old pussy ass nigga)
I don't really need you (yeah)
I don't really need you

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
Yah, and these bitches actin' funny too
I know that money rules
The only thing that will comfort you
Never trust again, I'll never get that comfortable
Ain't no friends in this game, they ain't honorable
I juggle chainsaw blades in this carnival
Nigga I'm a carnivore, bone collector connoisseur
Cutting off your mother fuckin' head with a katana whore

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
I don't really need you (I don't, I guess, old pussy ass nigga)
I don't really need you (yeah)
Nigga I don't really need you (I don't, old pussy ass nigga)
I don't really need you (yeah)
I don't really need you
