(Verse 1: Oddsox)
Writting words is a habit
I'm becoming an addict
I'll be scratching at my fucking skin until I can grab it
In the booth I'm causing damage, yeah my words they are savage
And in this game I need direction, someone help me to map it?
Shit, I will make it big on skill alone
Addiction and a curse I will never leaving the mic alone
Staying up till four AM, writting on my phone
But they don't care about your flows and multi syllables it's who you know
Who, how the fuck you getting props now?
I'm better than you'll ever be without laying a track down
I'm gunna pay my dues but my patience that is running out
I want to be professional produced someone tell me how
Fuck a webcam, put the camera down
I'm not a facebook rapper give me beats and I will find my sound
When will I be found? I will do it anywhere to any crowd
As long as you play it loud, fuck it yo my time is now

(Verse 2: Oddsox)
Time to rap
I'm sick of all the politics attached
In a scene I want to be in I just wanna lay tracks
Like when I send my songs to you and you say your not feeling me and then you give props to a rapper who ain't half of me
Is it coz his from your family tree?
Then I'm rejected from an unknown battling league
Want me to change styles here I'll give you a clue
That verse I messaged you is something fucking doper than you'll ever do
It's over due, my welcome party to the scene
Coburn emcee, first track I'm here to take the win
Na not caring if your playing, what your saying, validations over rated I am proud of my creation
For the fact I stand out from the heap, from the sheep that inhabit this Aus scene
My dream my control diss first brawl
I'll warn you Aussie rappers I am in it for the long haul
