[Hook]
I can sense that fake in you
Every time I look in your eyes
I don't believe that you love me
I don't believe that you love me
I can sense that fake in you
And deep down baby I know why
I don't believe that you love me
I don't believe that you love me

[Verse 1]
I remember when we first met, you was really cool
Now yo ass is just a nerve wreck, things you made me do
Was outrageous, I even think that I'm going crazy
Never would've thought a ho could make me
Take the fucking route that you been making me go
I'm serious, you think this a joke? (shit bitch), what you taking me for
I guess a joke is what it must be
I call you bitch then I call you ugly
Because you don't fucking love me
The things I do for you, you don't appreciate it
Every night I'm up I keep debatin'
Whether or not I should call up your phone or leave you alone
This type of shit'll stay alive buried deep in my bones
But you don't even notice that
Assuming you don't even know the facts
Fuck you I'm tired of holdin' back
My whole life I've been so nice and that's no lie
Girl yo ass is faking with me and I know why
Cause you don't love me

[Hook 2]
I can sense that fake in you
Every time I look in your eyes (it's cause you)
I don't believe that you love me
I don't believe that you love me
I can sense that fake in you
And deep down baby I know why (it's cause you)
I don't believe that you love me
I don't believe that you love me

[Bridge]
Love, love, love, love, love
Oh why ain't you real with me, yea, yea

[Verse 2]
I really wanna solve this but not with violence
It's like if we wanna fix things I gotta be the one who apologizes
And that's not the way it should be, I ain't a rookie
You got the game twisted up, take a look and see
I even made you a song on various albums
Now I'm like "Fuck a bitch, I'll do better without one"
You ain't gotta be with Hopsin (why)
I know I made a hell of a impact upon your life, I'll never be forgotten
But you will soon as I finish this song cause you've getting upper hands and that shit is just wrong
My feelings were strong, it's time for me to really move on
The feelings is gone cause you don't really feel me no mo' (fuck it)
It's yo loss so bitch so long
You ain't gonna stress my ass oh no
Be straight with me I'll be straight witchu
But since you fake with me I got hate for you

[Hook 2]

[Verse 3]
I'm tired of saying fuck a ho then always being gullible
It done happened so much I'm thinking it's uncontrollable
I'm screaming "I don't give a fuck" all the sudden
I'm driving to pick her up even though this bitch is nuts
I don't even get a trust ring I just keep gettin' stuck
But shit I done seen enough, man fuck I should beat her up
Nah, cause if I did that then I'mma get mad
And wish that I hadn't a did that so I just deal with this crap
But I ain't dealing with it ever again
Your problems only turn me into the cleverest man
No settlin' in witchu, rather settle with sins
For the rest of my life they go to the devil instead
These levels have spread way further than I had imagined it
I should've blew you off when I had a chance at it
But no, I was dumb I had to grab the shit
Tried to show you love and now disaster hit
