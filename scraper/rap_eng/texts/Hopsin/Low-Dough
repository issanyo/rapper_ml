[Hook]
Now I'ma get it in for the low dough
Watch me get it in for the low dough
Now I'ma get it in for the low dough
Watch me get it in
I'ma get it in

[Verse 1]
Let me introduce you to that new west coast
And get your fuckin' head bangin' like it's techno
But not Benassi or mister Tiesto
I'm SwizZz, three z's, but not to be slept on
Now catch your breath and get all calm and collected
Cause in a second i'ma do something so highly unexpected
You might fuckin' drop your jaws to the floor
Like when you caught your wife cheatin' in the back of your Ford, sayin'
"Emily, please, I know you threatened to leave
But I never thought for a minute you'd be fucking with D
Sucking his dick like a leech, nuts all in yo' cheek
And he's my best friend too, now both of you bleed"
I talk shit like a ass with a mouth
Then clap niggas like a beat made down in the south ("Hey")
I invite beef, I treat it like I'm fucking obese
A hungry nigga, yes I'm ready to eat

[Hook]
Now I'ma get it in for the low dough
Watch me get it in for the low dough
Now I'ma get it in for the low dough
Watch me get it in
I'ma get it in
Now I'ma get it in for the low dough
Watch me get it in for the low dough
Now I'ma get it in for the low dough
Watch me get it in
I'ma get it in

[Verse 2]
See, I left school and chose to rap
Now I'm broke as fuck, without a deal
Askin' my dad for gas money and a 20 to eat
Feel like a bum on his knees
Getting excited for a crumb in the street ("What tha fuck?")
My part time job won't pay off
Hours getting cut and other niggas getting laid off
Economy stop, I'm tryin' to prosper
I see patients growin' a beard waitin' hours to see a doctor
Now what the fuck do you call justice?
I've seen a cop shoot a father like "Fuck it"
He did even choose to beat him like a drum stick
On new years day Grant was slayed by a fuckin' pig
So this was for Oscar Grant and his family
I send this message to anybody to challenge me
Ya'll fuckin' up the game and that's a no-no
You tryin' to get high, I can get you for the low-dough

[Hook]
Now I'ma get it in for the low dough
Watch me get it in for the low dough
Now I'ma get it in for the low dough
Watch me get it in
I'ma get it in
Now I'ma get it in for the low dough
Watch me get it in for the low dough
Now I'ma get it in for the low dough
Watch me get it in
I'ma get it in

[Verse 3]
Yo, I learned in life that nothing's fair ("Nothing")
So I get drunk as shit drinkin' absinthe like I wasn't there
I'll yank your girl by your nappy hair
Toss her down the stairs like a Slinky
Then spark a blunt like a fuckin' flare
Don't bother knockin' nigga, no one's there
I'm on vacation with Jeezy slappin' greedy jews that refuse to share
My flow is grizzly homie, try to bare
Something so rare
I'll make John McCain throw his arms in the air ("I love the US")
I spit on fake faggot rappers when I'm battlin'
I'm sick enough to drown shack in the shallow end
I rock stunner shades without the lens, count to ten
And go dumb like a retarded kid who ain't got no friends
I know it seems like I'm mad at life
But I see everything in grey, propably because I'm black and white
FV's the set, you've seen the logo
You tryin' to get high, I still got you for the low dough

[Hook]
Now I'ma get it in for the low dough
Watch me get it in for the low dough
Now I'ma get it in for the low dough
Watch me get it in
I'ma get it in
Now I'ma get it in for the low dough
Watch me get it in for the low dough
Now I'ma get it in for the low dough
Watch me get it in
I'ma get it in
