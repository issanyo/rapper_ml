[verse 1]
Women are screwed up
And there’s not many of them I do trust
I need to find me some new sluts
Cuz the ones I’ve been involved with the wrong shit
They only good for giving head and getting my balls licked
I keep saying, I’m done with them
Then run back, I’m very gullible when it comes to bitches yup
Thats a fun fact, I love snatch but it just ain't with the arguing
When you baffle me with bullshit
Home its hard to win and once you make up
All the problems start again
Now you want to delete the situation
Your heart is in
The bitch Is low down and not pleasing
But you just stick around and try to work shit
Out for some odd reason and then it Never worked
And she leaves with the last laugh
Walking away like ha ha
That shit makes my ass mad
So to my ex
Guess what?
I’m about to do wonders
Im cutting you out of my life
And your ass ain't getting my new number

[hook]

I knew that
You were danger
But thought it could be way worse
So just do me a favor
Stay away from me
We’re strangers
I knew that
You were danger
But thought it could be way worse
So just do me a favor
Stay away from me
We’re strangers

[verse 2]
See I use to be that kid
That had no chance with bitches
I would stutter up
Like a game that glitches
I couldn’t get digits
Sweaty palms like I had on winter mittens
But I switched up game  with an allius
So why should I keep fighting with you
When I can get any broad in an 800 mile radius
You can say it is ludicrous
But your the one that ruined us
Stupid is as, stupid does
N I’m not going to wait around
Like a stupid fuck knowing my worth
I’m the guy that would hold your purse
Open the door to let you go first
But I’m not sure what is worse
You or the fact I let you fool me
In the love, Jesus Christ, It really hurst
I want you to watch me like I’m cnn
Every morning say the same shit again
Act like the world is my friend
Until it finds a new trend
Then you can go ahead and get on that
Brand new, cuz the smartest thing
I could do is become a stranger to you
Let this relationshop through
Cuz the thought of you makes me puke!

[hook]
I knew that
You were danger
But thought it could be way worse
So just do me a favor
Stay away from me
We’re strangers
I knew that
You were danger
But thought it could be way worse
So just do me a favor
Stay away from me
We’re strangers

[verse 3]
The same women that I knew once
You know I had to let em go
And even if I love em to much
It wasn’t with it anymore
The same women that I knew once
You know I had to let em go
And even if I love em to much
It wasn’t with it anymore

[hook]
I knew that
You were danger
But thought it could be way worse
So just do me a favor
Stay away from me
We’re strangers
I knew that
You were danger
But thought it could be way worse
So just do me a favor
Stay away from me
We’re strangers
