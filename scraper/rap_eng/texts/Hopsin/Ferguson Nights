[Introduction: News Caster]
The images from this weekend of violence in the streets, stores being looted, and riot police with dogs barking and charging at protesters seem like they are out of another era. But this outburst of violence is going on in present day St. Louis Missouri. It all started with the fatal shooting by police of an unarmed black teenager

[Verse 1: D. Lynch]
We speak the way we feel, they don’t do us no favors
A life was lost, the cops gettin' no waivers
Let them all know we ain’t taking no favors
Gettin' yours pig, yeah sooner or later
It’s on every channel now, just look at the news
It’s a civil war yo, what does the president do?
He sends out tanks, riot tools to be used
Against poor people tired of being abused
This nation’s askew it feels like there ain’t a thing we can do
Watch our brothers die put they name on a tattoo
Run and join the navy, you got something to prove
It’s on every channel now, just look at the news
A kid’s dead in the streets and vengeance is due
Screaming for blood, a head for the world to view
They coming for death ‘cause vengeance is due
Better look in the mirror 'cause that person is you

[Hook: D. Lynch]
As we get closer in, better hold ya wife
Light went to dark, live the coldest nights
Could lose my life on the roll of the dice
Death is just a shadow on Ferguson Nights

[Hook: D. Lynch]
As we get closer in, better hold ya wife
Light went to dark, live the coldest nights
Could lose my life on the roll of the dice
Death is just a shadow on Ferguson Nights

[Verse 2: D. Lynch]
I ain’t afraid of death, not afraid to get shot
If they push me wrong, then I’m killing a cop
Fight for Michael Brown yo, I’m blowing the spot
Kill Zimmerman too for bringing the pot
It seems like since him, the violence never stopped
And they blame it on race, gangsta rap, and games
Such a fucking disgrace, ya minds just going to waste
Man, what in the fuck happened to this place?
We got crooked cops and racist politicians
Homophobic Christians, a conservative mission
Blame it on the Muslims, the whole nation’s bitchin'
Nothing but prejudice the media’s spitting
Screaming death to Islam in the name of Christ
While the police go and take another life
From St. Louis yo, to ABQ
Out for blood, ‘cause vengeance is due

[Hook: D. Lynch]
As we get closer in, better hold ya wife
Light went to dark, live the coldest nights
Could lose my life on the roll of the dice
Death is just a shadow on Ferguson Nights

[Hook: D. Lynch]
As we get closer in, better hold ya wife
Light went to dark, live the coldest nights
Could lose my life on the roll of the dice
Death is just a shadow on Ferguson Nights

[Verse 3: Jidnak]
Keep lying to ‘em, McDonald’s flow they lovin’ it
Everything’s confusing when it’s coming from the government
So they make us feel with all these problems and the struggle shit
Born into a society where everything is limited
Born into this poverty but I ain’t going ending it
I’m a fucking rebel on the front line, I am in this shit
Coppers they all head chopping they trying to split your wigs
Telling our rebels keep calm load us with sedatives
They lying to us, that shit on TV is propaganda
Better grip your kids, kiss your wife, you better call your nana
I know some people in high places who speak proper grammar
I got some lawyers who get paid to keep me out the slammer
Me and D. Lynch murdering beats with no knife or hammer
And I got anger deep inside of me
So I take a lot of drugs just to cope with society
We ain’t starting no riots, we’d rather move quietly
I stole a lot of shit and sold it for pennies
But all the wrong that I did, bitch you still couldn’t offend me
I just wanna' feed my fam' before this war reaches ending
But I ain’t getting fucking paid for all this knowledge I’m lifting
We living relentless they like to hang our freedom from fences
We came from the churches when niggas chop they just do their dishes
Ain’t no repentance, my niggas out here living malicious
You tell me you love this world, bitch I think you’re suspicious

[Hook: Jidnak]
As we get closer in, you better hold ya wife
Light went to dark, live the coldest night
I could lose my life at the roll of the dice
Death is just a shadow on Ferguson’s Night

[Hook: Jidnak]
As we get closer in, you better hold ya wife
Light went to dark, live the coldest night
I could lose my life at the roll of the dice
Death is just a shadow on Ferguson’s Night
