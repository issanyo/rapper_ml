[Chorus]
Every morning my dick gets bigger [?] ( bigger)
So I just let it hang right out the zipper (Wha-what's my name?)
You should already know (Wha-what's my name?)
You should already know
This ain't no motherfucking guessing game, bitch

[Verse 1]
Yo, my name's Hop, it's not a secret I hide
See, I love rap music, I try to keep it alive
Same time I'm the nigga that all the people despise
'Cause I have to go commercial, their policy is to lie
Follow me, you'll inspire, we'll damage shit on the way
Slamming the older strings 'til I panic, hit on the brakes
Then crash in the open waist, smashing the shoulder blades
And gassing the motor sprays, 'til their asses explode in flames
Not a celebrity, never kick it on Beverly
Heavily dropping bombs, I'm breakin' it with no set of keys
I sever weak rappers who not on my pedigree
'Cause on a tombstone is as hard as your name will ever be
I hope you lockin' the doors, I'm an unstoppable force
I'm on fire, you cannot get the torch
I got a spot in the source, no I did not get endorsed
See I'm just doin' what I do and gettin' props in the course, you know?

[Chorus]
Every morning my dick gets bigger [?] ( bigger)
So I just let it hang right out the zipper (Wha-what's my name?)
You should already know (Wha-what's my name?)
You should already know
This ain't no motherfucking guessing game, bitch

[Verse 2]
You wanna hate on me just 'cause I rap sinful?
I beat the fuck out of you, then beat it back in you
In a packed venue, stab your ass with a snapped pencil
Then stomp on your fuckin' spinal cords 'til your back's crippled
I'm iller than a flat chest bitch with fat nipples
And ash ripples who talks with a snag whistle
And claims that her crabs tickle, homie, it's that simple
I dedicate my life to come up with these bad insults
Drove to Young Money in a broke old whip
And jumped at Lil Wayne with a pogo stick 'til I broke both hips
Hop ain't takin' no more shit
I put you rappers in the chokehold quick
So you can go blow dick, bitch
Hop's a demon, my wild image is not deceiving
I spit like a slutty bitch who doesn't swallow semen
I like beefing 'cause I'm not a vegan
So I got a reason to cut you up and then eat you with the proper seasoning

[Chorus]
Every morning my dick gets bigger [?] ( bigger)
So I just let it hang right out the zipper (Wha-what's my name?)
You should already know (Wha-what's my name?)
You should already know
This ain't no motherfucking guessing game, bitch
