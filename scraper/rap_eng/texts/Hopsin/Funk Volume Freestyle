[Verse 1: SwizZz]
"See I'll be damned if I fuck up the beat. My name is SwizZz and that's 3 z's I put you niggas to sleep. I rep the V-O-L-U-M-E 'til the day I'm deceased. It's ok to be relieved I'm not allowed to compete. But if I was, I would burn you, my spit's acidic. I put your face on the dash like a parking ticket. Reciprocal with the flow, nigga watch me flip it, and toss yo ass to﻿ left and let Hop get wicked."

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
"Yo, I got some ill demonic rap habits. Imma smash faggots. Before I never had a tongue cause the cat had it. I'm back at it with poisonous black magic, the industry fucked me now I'm ready to backstab it! With Funk Volume, I produced the movement. If﻿ you don't give a Fuck I pay a prostitute to do it. The games stuck so I just do what I could do to juice it, see I'm poppin' in the booth and then I'm coppin' loot from Ruthless!!"
