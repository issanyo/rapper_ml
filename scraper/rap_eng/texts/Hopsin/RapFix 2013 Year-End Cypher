See, I'm a lunatic rocking a crucifix
I'll mack on any chick I feel who got the cutest tits
I'm wanted a fugitive, robbing your whip to cruise in it
See, I'm the only kid on Elm Street that Freddy Krueger skipped
Pants sagging cause they too loose to fit
I'm torcherous
Grab a hammer and nail for your front door and board it shut
I stare deep in your eyes, rip out your soul and absorb it up
And have Biggie Smalls yelling out "call the coroner"
My groupies stay horny
They always call to say "Hopsin can you fly me out to Cali? Please pay for me"
I make that pussy pop for you like you skateboarding
Then you can come inside like a hurricane warning
I got a lot of sluts, I like to call Hopsin luck
But now I feel like having sex with these bitches is not enough
I needed something new for moments when I gotta bust
So lately I've been beating my dick with a pair of boxing gloves
I got the maddest rhymes, how dare yo ass deny?
I'll stab you in the brain with a knife, you can keep that in mind
You talking shit inside your house? Cool, fine, fuck it
I'll break in and stomp you out inside of it
Yeah, Hopsin
