[Hook]
I'm not what you could be
I'm not what I have been
I'm something that these people ain't ever seen
I'm a little bit psycho
A little bit crazy
And every other little thing in between
I'm addicted to drugs, drinks, smokes, and women
That's the shit that I love please don't forget 'em
Cause when I come 'round
You better believe that every single one of those things is following me

[Verse 1: GrewSum]
I had a dream where a drug took me
Plus three of my homies and then fuckin OD'd
Just me and my fuckin drinks I'm lovin the company
I'm somethin you love to see
A druggy stuck in a tree
In a snuggie puffin on weed
Swattin a bunch of bees
I'm not sure if they're real
But the buzzin won't fuckin cease
I've been seein em and hearin em for days upon days
Either I'm a honey pot or baby I'm crazy
Will someone help me?
Get a ladder or somethin
I'm thinkin of flappin my arms now and actually jumpin
It's been at least 5 days since I've had a concussion
From smashin my face with a hammer while laughin and chucklin
My good guy doll looks exactly like chucky did
He stabs me a lot and gets mad when I look at him
I really don't get it, I'm fuckin confused
And don't ask me what I'm on man I'm not in the mood

[Hook]
I'm not what you could be
I'm not what I have been
I'm something that these people ain't ever seen
I'm a little bit physco
A little bit crazy
And every other little thing in between
I'm addicted to drugs, drinks, smokes, and women
That's the shit that I love please don't forget 'em
Cause when I come round
You better believe that every single those of things is following me

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
I'm just a loony bastard
Lookin to get my doozy ass kicked
Who'd imagine my life sucks with a mood to match it
Non-enthusiastic beggin for cash and I rudely ask it
People assume that I'm just a loser they're usually accurate
Any day I beat my meat on a scale of like 2, 3 average
Then I properly wipe my penis off with a soothing fabric
After that I get creative and try to build fruity gadgets
I'm almost done making a bedframe with a moving mattress
That walks and talks
That should revive my loneliness
Hopefully I can make money and buy me a cozy crib
And get some older friends to have at the moment its only kids
My reality'll make all your homies say holy shit
I heard a rumor that Hopsin died and I hope he did
Cause his contacts are so fuckin ugly his nose is big
Oh, his music is just horrible it's inappropriate
And he claims he's not retarded no more but I know he is

[Hook]
I'm not what you could be
I'm not what I have been
I'm something that these people ain't ever seen
I'm a little bit physco
A little bit crazy
And every other little thing in between
I'm addicted to drugs, drinks, smokes, and women
That's the shit that I love please don't forget 'em
Cause when I come round
You better believe that every single those of things is following me

[Verse 3: Gravity Wisewords]
Shit I write this on an iPad, a scribble in the notebook
Do as I did as a kid commit until it's so good
They could hardly deny it
Work the kinks out my scientific triumphs
Supply em with quite a product to admire
To aspire to be like
Inspire light into your life
A wildfire in the minds of 100 set within your sights
Man I'm Gravity WiseWords I'm Gravioli
And if I'm not getting drunk I'm writing, mixing, and recording
Scummy bears in your jack
Funny dances to match
My underwear show my man legs and carebear print
Jack and coke makes a cracker grow some big balls
I grab them both from out your throat
Like fuckin cloraseptic or italian whores
Breakin barriers of language
Pack luggage my rebuttal will trouble your enlightenment
Like a couple of vicodin
Call me the high fructose in your airplane snacks
I mean your jujyfruits your tater chips your chocolate raisinets

[Hook]
I'm not what you could be
I'm not what I have been
I'm something that these people ain't ever seen
I'm a little bit physco
A little bit crazy
And every other little thing in between
I'm addicted to drugs, drinks, smokes, and women
That's the shit that I love please don't forget 'em
Cause when I come round
You better believe that every single those of things is following me
