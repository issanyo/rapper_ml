[Intro: Turbine]
You have to decide what you want and what you wanna be
It's time to grow up boy, wipe your eyes, let yourself see
You're still surrounded by loved one to certainty
They know you're high stop being in love continuous but being in sleep

It will never be easy, there will be a hole
It's how you deal with it, reach out and save your soul
You gotta wanna grab their throats and rip them out
Grab it, snap it, smack it, crack it you know, I know I won't allow it

[Verse 1: Turbine]
But you've gotta [?] your shit together
Losing your shit, can get you locked away forever
You say never listen
Just want your glisten, this is ain't your crucifixion
Then once they were gone, and screaming out to save that song
If it's not me, then who is in around
I know my place, I know where I'm from
There's been once none of us to take place
Get the fuck out, move out my face
[?]
And I [] to west side scream at my face

[Chorus: Turbine]
The world keeps it turnin'
I am stay on running
To find my way without you
The world keeps it turnin'
I am stay on running
To find my way without you

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Yo
The day you died was the day my heart went cold
I look at myself up in the mirror and ask where the heck did Marcus go
I feel so lost and clueless on my direction in life
You can feel my tears and feelings when they reflect on the mic
I wish you were here again, but again will never be
If I ever make it to heaven to see you, I wonder if you would even remember me
See, I done met a whole lot of people since you left but nobody can compete
You and I had a bond that was unbreakable back then, that's why it's sad to see
I want to have a family, live a life so happily
Put the smiles that we had are going upside down, really was a tragedy
And it's all my fault, I'm the reason that you were gone, girl
Now and living life up in your own world
"Oh," that's the sound I make when I think of us
No, that's the worse when I broke our love
I try not to let my feelings control me
Truth is, without you I'm lonely

[Chorus: Turbine]
The world keeps it turnin'
I am stay on running
To find my way without you
The world keeps it turnin'
I am stay on running
To find my way without you
