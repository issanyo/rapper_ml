[Verse 1]
Trust me, it takes far less than two to whack
I’d rather stick my dick in a cheerio than in yo ass
That’s like pouring some water but with no glass
Somebody get you back in school cuz clearly you have no class
Interrupting me while I’m tryna talk to my friends and shit
Call me out for calling you a whore, now where’s the evidence
It’s hidden in the lines you’ve probably taken bout twenty dicks
In twenty minutes, that’s a gang bang like my fucking lyrics

Already trashed your friend now it’s time for you
I apologized to her, so what are YOU gonna do
You avoid me every time we fucking cross our paths
Even though the first day I felt like ass

Said your name four times, you avoided me five
Put my life on the line just recording this rhyme
Just kidding all you got is a fuckboy that can’t drive
How he gonna find me, when he can’t get it inside

(HOOK)
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy

Oh shit
Who next we got on this list here?
Oh man

[Verse 2]
The first one, I was tryna make him fight me
Now I feel that he the only one that’s gonna ride for me
You see me buzzing around, so you tryna get some
Just wait until all of your motherfucking debt come
They ain’t gonna respect you til you get out and do shit
They value someone who chase they dreams, so I do this

You can call me meek mill, cuz dreaming ain’t enough
I’mma chase that shit, til my feet get rough
You expect me to blow, so I can throw some your way
Expect free tickets on all of my tour dates

Backstage passes, to meet the other rappers
It’s clear as day, I’ve surrounded myself with faggots
Progression only happens if you step out of a box
Get your new friends, new clothes and new socks
That was whacker than the shit you tried to send to me for a spot
So I shot you down, like I did yo girl she a thot


(HOOK)
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy

[Verse 3]
You were the love I used to see in my dreams
But when we met how come shit can never be what it seem
I was pleased with the things we did together
It's like we was a team
But you would change when I flee from the scene

Around me you were pure hearted, loving and caring
And when we hung out you'd even brighten up your appearance
You fooled me like you were smart, cute and something to stare at
But you was fronting little bitch, now I'm struggling to bare it

The fact that I barely have to change this verse
Just shows how fucked up you are, you got me hurt
Like Marcus, don’t make me start shit
You the one that slept with that faggot in the leather jacket

There’s no dude, you would let get past
Our bond that we had, you put it dead last
I thought I was Heaven, but I realized quite fast
You were sent from Hell, a fucking devil with a pretty mask

(HOOK)
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy
