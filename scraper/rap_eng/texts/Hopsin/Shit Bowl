[Verse 1: G-Mo Skee]
When I spit, you can hear the brute strength that my bars got
I can hold my breath and make the stars drop
Imagine what'll happen when my heart stops
Bring 2012 to 2010 mo'fucker set your alarm clock
Apocalyptic visionary, sending niggas to cemeteries
You talk shit and you getting buried
Fags can't hide, I brought a bear trap to gay pride
And threw it in the parade when it came by
Jumped in a bulldozer, ran a fucking school over
The dead bodies made it move slower
Pull over at the light, I'mma scream fuck you
And throw a pipe bomb in your fucking sunroof
This is twisted metal, terrorism on a different level
I got a problem and it's getting settled
Anything I see move, I'm squashin'
It's me and Hopsin, we don't have any other option

[Hook: G-Mo Skee]
The school bully's back if you get close
You can get your head shoved in the shit bowl
And I ain't playing with you nerd-ass niggas
Talk shit and get your punk ass served fast nigga

One of my folks might let a clip go
And then you get your head shoved in the shit bowl
And I ain't playing with you nerd-ass niggas
I put your head next to a turd fast nigga

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
I'll catch you on a day when you high-rollin'
Thinking that life's golden, till you get all your supplies stolen
Murdering niggas is my slogan, cuz when the nine's loaded
Your body gone stop working because I broke it
Fuck the world, shit I'm mad at y'all
Call the cops, bitch I am the law
Crazy enough to dress as Santa Claus
Wearing a pair of your grandma's drawers
Catapulting bodies across the lobby like cannonballs
Let's play a game, yo you see this clock?
Well I'mma choke you and let's how long it takes until your breathing stops
I'm fucking nuts, don't believe I'm not
I'll fuck a pregnant bitch and pound her fucking pussy till the fetus pops
So hold a Bible, and brainstorm on your survival
Cuz tonight I'm riding doing drive-bys on motorcycles
So look out, I'm creeping up on my tiptoes
Bout to leave your fucking head shoved in the shit bowl

[Hook]
