[Intro]
It's a jungle out there, you gotta have
It's a jungle out there, you gotta have

[Verse 1: R.A. the Rugged Man]
Yo, I'll put my dick out and I'll pee on your property being a mockery
I'm abusive cheating never believing in monogamy,  mediocrity
Pockets full of singles at the strip club, cash dropping, no class ass riding
I'm heinous, atrocious, repulsive, I'm past shocking
Rappers is speaking with no heart, don't start, it don't matter
I can slay you to Bach, Bethoven, Amadeus Mozart
At the dinner table cursing wiping cum on your curtain
I'm a poverty pirate, a poor penny pinching pitiful person
I'm from the 80's where we were skeezing and pleasing the skeezers
Thieving and popping and shooting and robbing and boosting and stealing your sneakers
Won't be in Forbes mag on no Forbes listes, but my life is parties
And gambling, hookers, whore houses and porn bitches
Hotel orgies with groupies, we rock stars, heart throbs
On the roof throwing cinder blocks from the hoods at cop cars
I'mma disrespect you to pigs, you was squealing too, they didn't protect you
Living and learning and losing listening to the lecture, hitting it and giving it extras
Snatch your prom date, rip the cunt hole, I'm the bully, get your lunch stole
House parties, stick my balls in the punchbowl, come on, sing it

[Chorus: Ruste Juxx]
If you sick twisted, disgusting
It's a jungle out there, you gotta have
(Hits, hits, hits, nigga, hits hits hits
Hits, hits, hits, nigga, hits hits hits)
You gotta have
If you sick twisted, disgusting
It's a jungle out there, you gotta have
(Hits, hits, hits, nigga, hits hits hits
Hits, hits, hits, nigga, hits hits hits)
You gotta have

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Yo, it's Rugged Man and Hop, we never get handed props
We keeping it dope and underground as the planet watch
If you want some bullshit, we spitting lyrics, then dammit stop
Talking like you the hardest artist and you just can't get knocked
So keep thinking that, take this track and play it back
Just to remind you that everything you fucking say is wack
But don't get mad and start cussing at us
Cause we just finally fixed the shit cause you was fucking it up
Yo, I'm sick of the game and everything it deals with
Yo, R.A. come over and bring the kill switch
Our brains are real sick, insane and filled with
A gang of ill shit, we can't be killed, bitch
Who want it with us? We never tow and get up
Don't try to step up cause I promise that you'll only get bucked
Emcees are scared running as we slowly erupt
We was born for this, yo, it's time to bring the chorus in

[Chorus: Ruste Juxx]
If you sick twisted, disgusting
It's a jungle out there, you gotta have
(Hits, hits, hits, nigga, hits hits hits
Hits, hits, hits, nigga, hits hits hits)
You gotta have
If you sick twisted, disgusting
It's a jungle out there, you gotta have
(Hits, hits, hits, nigga, hits hits hits
Hits, hits, hits, nigga, hits hits hits)
You gotta have
If you sick twisted, disgusting
[?] then why don't you go? (underground hitz)
If you [?] society [?], why don't you go?
Underground hitz
