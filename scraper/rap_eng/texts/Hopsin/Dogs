[Verse 1]
Don't be telling me how to do this shit cause I got this
"I ain't giving the people what they want", man that's nonsense
Niggas putting voices up in my head like my conscience
You ain't got no clue who this singer be, man I'm Hopsin
I don't put this shit out just so you bozos could dock it
Your shit will never match up to none of mine when I drop it
Why don't you put your pen and pad away and just stop it
You do whatever the fuck you do and I'll do my shit
I don't even care if somebody said you was tight
Cause I know you can't do half the shit I do on the mic
And I don't do you what you niggas want, I do what I like
You keep on bumping yours I'll be thinking you wanna fight
Niggas steady hatin' and fakin' like they be straight with me really they breakin' me, playin' me just like a Gameboy
They think the better than me telling me I'm going to succeed then they go and throw some dirt on my name, boy

[Hook]
Somebody get this dog man he trying to fight me
He don't want to see me do my thang on the mic
Cause I bring the pain on the mic
Now whose dog, ah, whose dog, ah
Whose dog is that?
Whose dog is that?
Man whose dog is that?
Somebody better put a chain on his ass, man

[Verse 2]
I'm a genius up on the mic when I spit flows
I may be a retarded nigga but I'm sick though
Still the same small lid nigga with the big nose
Think you can hang with the pros
Man get yo
You want to go running mouth because the kid's hot
You should just go out and find something other than hip-hop
I'm just trying to do what I do I'm not trying to get shot
Niggas always hating and making me fucking flip, ahh
I told you over and over that I don't like you
Then niggas want to wonder why I turned into a psycho
All this shit has got me feeling like I'm suicidal
You think I'm stupid you'll be surprised at the shit that I know
And I'm so wicked when I'm kickin' and spittin' shit that I'll be off of the motherfucking hizook
Hopsin is rockin' and droppin' shit all the time and if you don't believe him, go take a lizook

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Nigga get the dog
Niggas have to go and make me angry
I'm pretty sane but I may seem crazy
Ain't no way in hell I'll let these fake g's bait me
I'm a straight monster, somebody please save me
A lot of you rappers coming up with that fake shit
I'm here to put an end to it nigga so face it
I haul my black ass up cause I'm ain't going to take this
I'm on some other type shit while y'all still on the basics
Hop's got it locked and ain't nobody stoppin' him
All these sick kicks that I'm bluffin' I got a lot of 'em
Feel free to call my name if you got a problem
Or put your fucking hands up if you wanna rock with 'em
Somebody better take control of this dog
Before I cock something back and put a hole in this dog
A hole in the stone
Leave his ass cold on the floor
Man this dog don't know who he fucking with yo

[Hook]
