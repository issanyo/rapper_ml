[Intro]
I just, I just don't, I just, I just, I just don't know
I - I - I just, I just don't, I just, I just don't know what to do
I just, I just don't, I just, I just, I just don't know
I - I - I just, I just don't, I just, I just don't know what to do

[Verse 1]
I'm back, nigga, what's up?
Hop, how'd you get your buzz up?
I heard you signed over your soul to the Devil
Was it true? Nigga, shut the fuck up!
In my heart there ain't much love
So if you get bashed, then that's tough luck
FV doin' shit so big, haters
I'm on your side now, nigga, fuck us!
It's Knock Madness, yeah, I'm back up in this
I'm a real nice nigga, but I rap with vengeance
Only got bad intentions
And I'm lookin' for a new mouth that my nutsack could fit in
I look like an idiot to grab attention
But my new fans tellin' me to trash my lenses
It's bad for business, I'm lackin' senses
It feels like I'm trapped in a black dimension
Stepped in this bitch to wreck
So don't disrespect, I promise that it'd be a big regret
I'll twist ya neck, I'm lookin' for a fish to catch
I chop niggas up, yeah, I learned it from Tech
I got hoes all over that wanna give me (dome)
They all yellin': "Hopsin, you turn me (on!)"
But I feel like it's the Devil tryna get me (whoa!)
And I don't wanna do it, nigga, send me (home!)
Nigga, I'm so cool, but I feel so low
See, I got a crew, but I feel solo
I cruise, but the wheels don't roll
You feel what I'm sayin'? Shit, neither do I
I'ma give you niggas one more album
And after that it's peace out
And I'm leavin' you guys, you know why?

[Hook]
The world made me feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!

[Verse 2]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, NO!!!
Hopson is doomed, locked in a room
Spaced out like a little pop in the shrooms
God lit a fuse, now I gotta make a decision
And I don't really know which Hopsin to choose
I'm a big wreck, did you not get the news?
I made a million bucks but did not get amused
How did I manage to get robbed from the truth?
Maybe I shoulda never went and dropped outta school
It's not that bad, you're okay, kid, cheer up!
But I got a life that I ain't too sure of
Swagger lookin' just like Ace Ventura
Can't look at myself, I might break this mirror
(Shit! Fuck! Fuck!) I'm paranoid
I panic over every little scary noise
See, when I go pick up the phone and tell friends about it
They won't answer, 'cause they're annoyed
I'm like uggghh, I put a porno on
'Cause my life ain't awesome, man
Jack off, go to sleep, wake up, jack off again
Then repeat the cycle
Can't go to sleep unless I leave the lights on
You don't know how many fuckin' demons I know
Maybe I should go and tell 'em read the Bible (Fuck! Oh no!)
I don't even like rap
The only thing I wanted was just to be cool
And hang out with a group of friends
And solve mysteries like I'm Scooby Doo
But I got way more than I bargained for
You can't chill when your heart is sore
I'm so mad I could start a war
So fuck Hopsin! Man, I don't even know who I are no more

[Hook]
I feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!

[Verse 3]
Man, y'all niggas tryna kill my vibe
Lately don't nobody feel my rhymes
Dizzy blowin' up tryna steal my shine
I'm all outta ammo, my skills just died
But, "Oh my God, I love 'Ill Mind 5'!"
The one where the dumb skippity bums get high
That there changed my whole entire life
You make more tings like that? I'll buy!
Well, I got news for you
My screws are loose (I'll tell ya)
This rap thing here's what I use to do
Now I'm movin' to (Australia)
When I go ghost I'ma get a house
On the Gold Coast, yellin' YOLO
On a couch, feelin' so dope, livin' low pro
So these foul niggas don't know
I'll be struttin' around like (hell yeah!)
Man, I'm losin' my mind
Y'all assume that I'm cool when I rhyme
See, I'm tryin' to be Marcus and Hopsin
But I get depressed when the two intertwine
Truthfully, I'm not the man that I used to be
Nobody cared, so I use the beat
To talk to, so I lose the heat
I'm cut bad and the bruise is deep
Is there anything you can do for me?

[Hook]
The world made me feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!

[Outro]
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
