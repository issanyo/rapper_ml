[Verse 1]
I've spent about ten years tryna work on my craft
Tryna save this hip-hop shit and disperse of the trash
But all my nerves have just crashed, cuz all the verses I've thrashed
Were meant to benefit my future, I'm uncertain it has
I rarely ever put something out to insert in your dash
Cuz as soon as I became a brand, my own purpose was smashed
I'm feelin' nervous in fact, I got no urges to rap
Now I don't think my fucking life can get more worthless than that
I see these (niggas) blowing up, who never do got the proper game
(Niggas) who fucking suck, Gucci and Wacka Flocka Flame
(Niggas) who makin' bucks, someone tell me I'm not insane
Cuz I feel the urge to run up on a bitch ass nigga and rob his chain
Dang! I thought I had it figured out
See I panic and I pout
Yo I've had it man, I'm out
God damn it, this shit's a clout
I'm the baddest, ain't no doubt
But my madness is about to turn me manic 'til I shout

[Hook]
How come the world is always quick to turn they back on me
Won't somebody tell me, you can go ahead, and fall asleep
I'll be in your dream
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dream
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dream

[Verse 2]
You all assume I'm evil, but actually I'm so nice
I've always been the lover boy like practically my whole life
Unhappy here with no wife, don't ask me I don't know why
I'm livin' life without no type of strategy to go by
I knew a bitch who I would go pick up when the day starts
A bitch who'd even like to watch me skate at the skate park
A bitch who I was making out with up in the graveyard
The same bitch who went and left my ass with a slayed heart
She cut it like an avocado, secretly hittin' clubs and poppin' bottles
Hanging with thugs or sucking a lots of cock yo
The biggest slut from Loveland, Colorado
Fuck a hoe, that’s Hopsin’s motto, my heart is vacant, you knock it's hollow
She met another guy who left the baby stuck inside
Her vagina then he just split and messed up her fuckin' life
Now she hits me up and I
Say go suck a nut, goodbye
All you sluts can die for wasting all my sacred love supply

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
To live a decent life what all does it take
I tried and tried to be the best but nothing falls in the place
And I'm a man but my struggle is gonna cause me to break
And just evolve me to hate I'm in a nauseous state
And shit it probably is fake but who's in control of it me or god
Is he the cause of why am I here the reason's odd
I'm broke and need a job, for spending cheese on broads
But y'all don't see the flaws I coat it up to keep it raw
And mc's who's got the most talent in this whole planet
Don't never get recognized when they dope at it
So they go back to the block hustlin' and dope addicts
Some niggas got the 'it factor' some niggas don't have it
Yo I'm at my last tears cuz everytime I think I'm out the matrix
I get sucked right back in
But man I'm hopin' things are change and the soul in me remains
Cuz the talent that I've got is way too cold to be contained

[Bridge] (x2)
No, no
What did I do to deserve this?
No, no
I don't even have a purpose

[Collision]
Pillow man (x4)
