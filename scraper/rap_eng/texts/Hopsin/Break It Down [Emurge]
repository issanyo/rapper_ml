[Verse 1]
Man, y'all know who I be, the raw rap nigga, yo
Catch me in the cut with all black tinted on
Now we 'bout to get it on
Girl let me hit it like the Pentagon
Tearing up every wall until it's gone
Sure enough to get my cheese, that ain't what I spending on
Sure enough to get to beat the woman I'm depending on
And I don't care if the girl sweet, like some cinnamon
I just wanna merk you one night, then I'm gone
Now, here we go, turn that shit up in the stereo
Loud now, wild out, let me know, you feel me, yo
All the ladies hit the flow while the niggas spit the flow
Shit, like I equipped the dough
That's why I get the ho's
They think I'm all that, yelling when I walk pass
Yellin' labels to me but these niggas don't talk crap
But that's cool though, ain't nothing new, yo
Let the nigga step up and he gon' get schooled, yo

[Hook]
I wanna see you take it low to the flow, bro
With the flow then bounce for me, girl
Step over when you fuckin' around for me, girl
I break it, break it, hold up
Break it down for me, girl, take it down low for me
Break it down for me, take it down low for me
Break it down for me, take it down low for me
I said break it, break it, break it down-down

[Verse 2]
Now, I'ma have to go, girl, if you don't work with me
Honey over there up in the corner trying to flirt with me
She real buzzed, she telling all her dirt to me
She asked me, "Can we leave here?" Certainly
She read her motherfuckin' mind
Now she hoppin' in my ride
Told y'all, ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I got this shit on lock, 'cause the kid's solo hot for me that
'Cause it's no lot (No!)
So, get it right nigga, cool as a icicle
But I'm hot too, so you might see a light drizzle
Y'all can't beat me, let alone cheat me
That's why I step up into your breezy
That's why she gone now
She ain't coming home now
She up in my crib jumping on the bone now
Come here, girl, I wanna see you get
And I ain't talking about later, right

[Hook]
I wanna see you take it low to the flow, bro
With the flow then bounce for me, girl
Step over when you fuckin' around for me, girl
I break it, break it, hold up
Break it down for me, girl, take it down low for me
Break it down for me, take it down low for me
Break it down for me, take it down low for me
I said break it, break it, break it down-down

[Verse 3]
I got that dope shit, dope enough to smoke this
Roll up in the dope with homies got the toasters
The only thing you're close to, my ass, nigga
Better stay in your place whenever I pass, nigga
Like I'm high class nigga
Even though I'm not though
I'm still in the hood at the same spot, yo
Same spot with the niggas that make things pop, yo
I live a thug life but I ain't Pac, yo (Nah!)
I'm Hopsinister and I be as real as the
Nigga with the studio, knowin' when the trick is pushed
Better believe my verses, man
I spit fire like I was one of them circus men
G, you roll over Hopsin, of course, rocky you know what's poppin'
So, hold your gossip, this ain't no nigga, he gonna stop it
I stay rugged, those styles untouchable
Now, tell me, who the fuck want it, yo?

[Hook]
I wanna see you take it low to the flow, bro
With the flow then bounce for me, girl
Step over when you fuckin' around for me, girl
I break it, break it, hold up
Break it down for me, girl, take it down low for me
Break it down for me, take it down low for me
Break it down for me, take it down low for me
I said break it, break it, break it down-down

[Outro]
I wanna see you take it low to the flow, bro
With the flow then bounce for me, girl
Step over when you fuckin' around for me, girl
I break it, break it, hold up
Break it down for me, girl, take it down low for me
Break it down for me, take it down low for me
Break it down for me, take it down low for me
I said break it, break it, break it down-down
