[Intro: Announcer]
Due to some violent content, parental discretion is advised

[Pre-Verse Ad-Lib: Hopsin]
Hmmm

[Verse 1: Hopsin]
My vision has always been golden
That's why I see the pearly gates starting to open
I ain't got no friends
Because I've been an omen, oh man
Hmmm, take a look at the enemies blood I am soaked in
Yeah, staring back at my reflection thinkin'
'Bout the hand of cards I've been holdin'
When I'm upset it's hard to control it
Soon as I'm fully charged, I unload it
This shit is keeping Marcus so devoted
To writing these crazy bars and you know it
I'm too steady with the juice
Get the booth ready, when I barge in I'm Hulk'n
I'm no longer with Avengers
Heart is frozen with some vengeance
8 years old, I was a menace
Can't get lost in all the critics
They judging when they ain't crawled up out the trenches
Look bitches, I'm making doe from all the bitchin'
You'd think I whip baking soda in the kitchen
Its U.P and taking over is the mission, the realest
And they should know the shit's encrypted, listen

[Pre-Chorus: Hopsin & Matt Black]
I debate
Should I smile like everything's good and pretend that life is great
Or should I let the world see the real me and not hide this pain
I tried to be like the rest of y'all, sorry I just can't
I'ma probably die this way (I'ma die this way)

[Chorus: Matt Black]
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Where did my mind go?
Tell me why am I letting these bombs blow
I'm stubborn and even my mom knows that
Am I lonely? Yes
I'm on one, that's why my homies left
I live with no regrets, motherfuckers I won't repent
Man, the other day I cussed my girlfriend's parents out
It is apparent now
They tryna justify their daughters bullshit?
Whelp, I am raw enough to air it out
I'm intense at times, in my mind
There's a grinch inside that tells me to write offensive lines
If the shit I do doesn't make sense in your head
Nigga fuck you cause it makes sense in mine
Yeah, I think I got a little ego
If you cut me open, you would see I'm full of it
From the 818, a motherfuckin' Panorama City hooligan
I see the whole world and everybody looking like a duplicate (that's true)
Bitch I do me, and that's the only way you'll ever see me doin' it

[Pre-Chorus: Hopsin & Matt Black]
I debate
Should I smile like everything's good and pretend that life is great
Or should I let the world see the real me and not hide this pain
I tried to be like the rest of y'all, sorry I just can't
I'ma probably die this way (I'ma die this way)

[Chorus: Matt Black]
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way

[Bridge: Joey Tee]
I don't feel no shame
Why should I hide this pain?
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Sorry we're not the same

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
There isn't much that anybody else can tell me
I'm the only nigga living in my shoes and this shit is overwhelming
I travel earth like a lost soul
Fires burning as I rot slow
There ain't many I can vent to in this world
I got family but we're not close
So I tell my story through a hot song
You all know to get your popcorn
When I hit you with the Ill Mind
Neverland? That's a place you know we're not goin'
This is struggle and pain
About me always being stuck in the rain
To be honest, I don't want it to change
I'ma take it to my death bed up until nothing remains

[Chorus: Matt Black]
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way
