[Verse: Hopsin]
When I got the call to come up to Tim's, I couldn't wait to
Damn it, who let the ape loose? Fuck a cage, I'ma break through
Ghetto, still sipping grape juice, who should I put the flame to?
If you hand me the throne just make sure it comes with a cape too
The only nigga with shit on lock is Hopsin, it ain't you
When I'm up to bat man, my only option is Babe Ruth
I never give into you incompetent lame dudes
I buss you in your fucking head with a bottle of Grey Goose
And I done lost myself, be happy? I don't know how to
The sunny days that I forgot to cherish are now blue
Nigga if you were me for while you would understand
If money doesn't change you, it'll change the ones around you
So I been ducking low, tryna hibernate and just find my way
I've been gassing, I gotta find the breaks 'til my mind is straight
I'm showing signs of hate 'cause I'm trapped in a darkness I embraced
Look me in my eyes, you could tell I'm ready to die today
If you see me then don't come over
I can't control my actions or emotions, the Devil's got the remote control an'
Style is cold and vulgar, got no composure
Defeating me is like tackling a juggernaut with some broken shoulders
So don't provoke, this is deadly and isn't user friendly
'Cause I own up to any truth you try to use against me
Since high school I've been known to be an abusive MC
I never stop the madness until I see you surrender
Welcome to Savageville, where shit ain't average
It's madness, imagine a pack a stragglers swinging from chandeliers
I'm in a Cavalier with a thot who drank a six-pack of beers
Getting road head and she's driving, the fuck is happening here?
I ain't calm and peaceful, nah, my small cerebral
Is often evil, better hide like Doctor Jekyll's alter ego
Call your people, I'm mad as addicts who lost the needle
Don't buy my album because it's all illegal, too off to be on
I'm talking Sm√©agol, I launch torpedoes, bitch, I'm the dirtbag
That ran up on wearing a Purge mask when you got your purse snatched
Here's your one way ticket to Hell in first class
Y'all all be making my nerves spaz, my word craft will make you disperse cash
I'm the special ed nigga you ignored, y'all the motherfuckers that I do it for
When I step inside the booth I'm lighting everything on fire like I was the Human Torch
Whooping ass, kicking through the door, spewing gore, breaking windows of your new Accord
Anyone who ever left better not be coming back to try to build a new rapport
I'm wild rude, a foul dude, I prowl through
I step on the mic and all the sudden my bowels move
Catching bodies? I'm 'bout to
I'm the one you should bow to, you niggas is ass, trash, cow poo
Style's based off pure vengeance, I'm a fierce engine
You'll get rear-ended, there's weird tension, my peers sense it
I'm a feared misfit, a geared henchman, you scared senseless
It's tear-drenching, but you'll be hooked after a mere sentence
