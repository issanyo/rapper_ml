[Intro]
Mama, can you buy me some white eyes?
Hop on the hop train, hop on the hop train

[Hook]
Oooh, Hop on my train
I can take you anywhere you wanna go
And if you don't wanna leave we're goin' round and round
Baby all you gotta do let me know
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?

[Verse 1]
Knock, knock, open the door
I came to sabotage all of your brains
I don't necessarily have a cause
Straight out of the fucking studio next to my dad's garage
Up on the Macintosh
Whippin' up my rap collage
I got some motherfuckers hassling me
Because I made it off of rap and not a bachelor degree
I plotted my plots accurately
During that time I was gone for a minute
Now I'm back in the streets
Fuck you haters I've been like this since before you was out
And I'm that psycho rapper that your label warned you about
Should I wait for you to blow up
Or should I torture you know
And do I have a heart for sympathy?
Of course I do, pal
You got a deal?
That's kinda strange to me
'Cause see you ain't really a thing to me
But see me, most niggas can't compete
Now bang the beat
And lets give them what they came to see

[Hook]
Oooh, Hop on my train
I can take you anywhere you wanna go
And if you don't wanna leave we're goin' round and round
Baby all you gotta do let me know
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?

[Verse 2]
I got all of you under my mind control
With nobody leaving until I say it's time to go
I'm single so I'm trying to find a hoe
A raw bitch, with a mean overbite like a dinosaur
You can gurgle on a nut or two
I'll never fall in love with you
See I got love for you
But I know you'll blow it on other dudes
And if I brought you home to my parents
What would my mother do?
Probably tell me to take your nasty ass to another room
That's why I'm taking you to motel 6
If you don’t like the way I’m stylin' on you, oh well, bitch
Oh, you're mad because every nigga treat you just like that
Well, you were the one at the fucking club dressed like that
Now, hmm
I think you might have lost it
You look nothing like a boss chick
Me, I'm trying to get my fucking balls licked
Let's flip a coin, head or tails, you call it

[Hook]
Oooh, Hop on my train
I can take you anywhere you wanna go
And if you don't wanna leave we're goin' round and round
Baby all you gotta do let me know
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?

[Verse 3]
I failed to listen
Corrupted from watching television
Go buy my album, fuck the clean, get the hell edition
Rapping like a maniac has put me in a swell position
If you met me in person you could tell I'm tripping
I never had a lot to lose, just a lot to gain
Always brought the pain
'Cause my mind is in the proper frame
While lazy niggas try to kick it like a soccer game
Talkin' like they gonna cop a range
But ain't got the change
I'm having a fucking ego trip
Because hip hop needs to reload quick
So look me up in the lab tight with some Doritos chips
And some emo chick
I'mma show you niggas how to be more sick
Check it
Yes, I'm from the west
If that's what your guessing
Let me teach you a lesson and show you the proper essence of wrecking
Dissecting the track is the only thing on my mind when I step in
When I follow those procedures I can label you as pathetic

[Hook]
Oooh, Hop on my train
I can take you anywhere you wanna go
And if you don't wanna leave we're goin' round and round
Baby all you gotta do let me know
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?


[Outro]
Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai
