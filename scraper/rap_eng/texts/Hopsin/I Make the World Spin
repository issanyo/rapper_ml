[Verse 1]
Yo, white eyes, black tee
Ill rhymes, that’s me
Hollywood's now labeled as lame
But I’ve been on that raw shit since I came in the game
Fuck this! Rap niggas trying act like they punk rock
Tight jeans, Mohawks screaming “fuck cops”
Y’all should get your fucking nuts chopped
You all look like you suck cock
Bust shots if you hate me
Yup that’ll fix the problem
Put me out there, leave it up to Mr. Goblin
To contribute to all the bullshit that’s dropping
So he can take his kids out Christmas shopping
Look at the niggas I'm spinning circles around
My verbal profound lyrics make them hurdle the town
They washed up 'til they gurgle and drown
Their whole dynasty I’m burning it down
Funk Volume, you’ve heard of it now

[Chorus]
I kick the bitches out
And let the girls in
Your baby daddy shouts
You stole my girlfriend
You see I’m on the prowl
I make the world spin, round
Welcome to the pain in my life
Yeah baby

[Verse 2]
Suicide, (huh?) trust I might
Tell 'em what my motto is fuck my life
Don’t need alcohol to upper-cut my wife
So much rage I could crush my mic
See I woke up on the wrong side of the bed
My brain works but the whole left side of it is dead
There’s a little small gremlin inside of my head
And lately I’ve been feeling like I'm living life on the edge
But wait a minute, this ain’t a gimmick, I can’t pretend it
I’ma scream it loud to the world just in case they forget it
Be careful of some of the knowledge that you take from critics
They tryin' to execute a nigga but I stay committed
New topic, mind over matter
Never needed my arms to climb up a ladder
You wack niggas don’t ever show signs of a rapper
It's getting too serious for you? Why, what’s the matter yo?

[Chorus]
I kick the bitches out
And let the girls in
Your baby daddy shouts
You stole my girlfriend
You see I’m on the prowl
I make the world spin, round
Welcome to the pain in my life
Yeah baby

[Verse 3]
Yeah, the black man’s back
There is no topic my raps can’t smash
The state of hip hop that can’t pass
It’s all full of shit like a fat man’s ass (eww)
May I please have just enough trust
In you motherfuckers to leave the rust of us stuck
I turn my head and now you're messing stuff up
All that "You! Turn it up!" Just shut the fuck up
(Damn) I’m rude and I'm so wicked
I’ll make sure you never blow up
Like a balloon with a hole in it
I knock hustlers for a living, got muscles for the women
Got puzzles for the children, blaow
Plus I got a sick delivery, that’ll have you niggas shivering
And stunned from bombs I drop lyrically
You can’t touch my shit
So I’ma end it just like this
Suck my dick!

[Chorus]
I kick the bitches out
And let the girls in
Your baby daddy shouts
You stole my girlfriend
You see I’m on the prowl
I make the world spin, round
Welcome to the pain in my life
Yeah baby
