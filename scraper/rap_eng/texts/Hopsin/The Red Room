[Verse 1: HighRise]
Blow up my phone,
But I'm comatose,
To the outside world
I'm close to ghost,
I got a girl on my dick while I'm
Writing these licks, that's it
I'm a shut in with a bad bitch
Like an amputee with a
Bad itch, I know what I want and
I'm at it
I'm a single track mind on two paths
Put the mic to her back for that ass clap
Take a clip of that, make a beat to rap with
Then jump in the sheets and we can
Make some magic,
Like Peanut butter and Jam, yeah
Flippin the pots and the pans,
With a dope chick and a dope track
I be coked out or I'm close now
Always closed down, for the throw down
Throw the clothes out, stay the fuck out
And nobody else is allowed
See the sign on my door, you stay out
Got a sock on the knob like it's college
All over, you know I won't be pullin out
I'm fathering beats, like I'm fathering babies
This lady, might be momma now
If all the sounds that we worked on
together sell out I might keep her around,
So you'd better learn how to count

[Pre-Hook: Hopsin]
I been on dumb shit,
Mentally dysfunction from being locked in a dungeon
Don't make assumptions
When a nigga on stage I can make em get down like lunges
Yes it's true
Solo I don't rep a crew
Niggas like, "who the heck are you"
Dropped in from a space ship and wrecked the roof
Hold up nigga you tryna step to who?

[Hook: Josiah Woods]
Locked up inside
'Side the dungeon of a cruel world, no lie
Paint the picture of a cold heart no time
To be wasted on these niggas
I'm just tryna get it, get it
Get my grind on
My mind on that business
Cant match my grind dog
Can't lie nigga I'm gone get it
Bad bitch wanna ride dog
She finna go get this work
I'm talking pussy bangers bangers
On my mind, On my mind

[Verse 2: HighRise]
I'm young and I'm crazy about her,
I'm boutta take away ya daughter
I'm moving my time from the party
Life cuz I know that I won't do without her
In a jail cell that I pay for
I pay rent on these bars
I'm an inmate by choice til
I can pay rent with these bars,
I'm talking bands filled with this
Rap money, Cash counted on those titties
Like stacks on racks, back to back,
Til I drown her in that cash money
I'm Scrooge McDuck in the cash pool
We screw and fuck in the cash fool
She got a hundo stuck in her ass crack
I'll make a withdrawl from that ass fool
Don't doubt it

[Pre-Hook: Hopsin]

[Verse 3: Yaydo]
Walk in late, still talk shit,
Walk up the finest honey and asked for a kiss,
as she lean in and go to perk up the lips,
I holla sike bitch and I dead leg the chick,
Snatch up the mic, let you know I'm here to boogie,
got the game head locked like a bully giving noogies,
Ever since I was young I been in pursuit of pussy
now my palms are looking hairier than masturbating wookiees.
Now I'm Drinking Bacardi, while she touch my Hardee's,
whipp-in dunkin donuts in back of an Arby's,
the she-nanigans I been at em again,
I don't wanna just talk I ain't tryna be friends
Bitch I only had salad, your steak was like 10,
And you still expect half when I don't get no head,
Not even a tug in the back of the men's?
Must be out of your damn mind got no money to spend.
