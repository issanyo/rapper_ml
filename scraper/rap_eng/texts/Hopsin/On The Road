[Grotesque:] Ey yo what up Hop?
[Hopsin:] What up?
[Grotesque:] Shit, just chillin' here with Merkules
[Hopsin:] Oh aight, what up?
[Merkules] What's good homie?
[Grotesque:]
Ey you remember I used to tell you about that girl the other day?
I was just telling him the same shit
[Hopsin:]  Nah what you talking about?
[Grotesque:] Uh, Man, I —I don't even know, man
[Hopsin:] What!
I don't know—I don't know where to start
[Corbett:] Yo, Grotesque
[Grotesque:] Hey what up, Corbett
[Corbett:] Let's get it
[Grotesque:] Aight

[Hook: Corbett]
She thinks that I'm tellin' her lies
And I know that she don't believe
One day, we're doin' just fine
And the next day she wanna leave
And I can't take one more fight
Yo this ain't it's s'pposed to be
And she can't take one more night
On a road to these hopeless dreams

[Verse 1: Grotesque]
She mad 'cause I'm about to do a show again
The cars loaded then
Gettin' jealous 'cause these groupies always showing in
Infection toys, my music in the recession for
What I do, is gotta second guessing, these attention whores
And more than that, I can't finish the sentence
Nor I cannot get through the door with no fuckin' questions
Lord, I feel the intention's sword
These girls nuts, she think I'm about to fuck all these sluts I never met before
This whole time I been paying shit no mind
I'm so blind, feels like every one I know died
My cold rhymes are battle cries like Roll Tide
Control time and keep my eyes on the goal line
Meanwhile she tells me not to focus much
Knowin' damn well that I do it for the both of us
I put my heart in every track that I open up
And it's kinda bogus that we closest when we broken up

[Hook: Corbett]
She thinks that I'm tellin' her lies
And I know that she don't believe
One day, we're doin' just fine
And the next day she wanna leave
And I can't take one more fight
Yo, this ain't how it's s'pposed to be
And she can't take one more night
On a road to these hopeless dreams

[Verse 2: Hospin]
There was a chick I put my life on the line for
Beautiful black hair and her height was like five-four
Her smile was nice more than you wild, one night whore
Problem was, she would get all violent when I tour
Acting as if I wasn't trustworthy
And all I do is drive, perform, go to sleep and get up early
I'm knowing that groupies a blood thirsty
And she did too, she thought I was cheating, that's what the fuck hurts me
That year had a painful summer
When I finally arrived back home, the bitch had changed her number
'Til this day this shit remains a bummer
I think and wonder why would she do that to someone who would aim to love her?
I don't know, that's just how chicks act
So through my successes, how I'll get back
I don't like talking about this crap, I get emotional and shit
And my stomach starts hurting, man, I hope I don't get sick
Yo

[Hook: Corbett]
She thinks that I'm tellin' her lies
And I know that she don't believe
One day, we're doin' just fine
And the next day she wanna leave
And I can't take one more fight
Yo this ain't how it's s'pposed to be
And she can't take one more night
On a road to these hopeless dreams

[Verse 3: Merkules]
It was a blessing, no question that we fell In love
And now she's acting like I played her and I set her up
I know I haven't been home much, and I bet it's tough
But you keep acting like I'm someone you could never trust
I let her cuss and brush it off like it didn't happen
It's crazy what a chick'll do to you to get reactions
Second guessing me and calling me a liar
I been wit' you since my name was at the bottom of the flyer
So keep it up, and you could get what you ask for
I didn't do shit now, now you think I'm an asshole
Who raps, gets paid, sip liquors, and tag toes
Well that shit's played, so just quit it and have hope
All my fans online think she's using me
What can I say, this shit is not the way it used to be
And as stupid as a human, I need room to breathe
Usually I lose it, but it something that she do to me

[Hook: Corbett]
She thinks that I'm tellin' her lies
And I know that she don't believe
One day, we're doin' just fine
And the next day she wanna leave
And I can't take one more fight
Yo this ain't how it's s'pposed to be
And she can't take one more night
On a road to these hopeless dreams
