[Verse 1: Hopsin]
I'm tired of feeling lost
Staring up at the ceiling wall
Hating the world, wanting to kill them all
The government is still the cause
And they conceal it all
From UFOs to planes making buildings fall
Stuck in a life that I ain't ask for
You're blowing up off of wackness when my level of skill is past yours
Crunch time has got my abs sore
And when I'm ready I'm hopping out of the matrix through the back door
I need some new shoes and a new shirt
My girl's mad because I care more about music than I do her
No medic insurance and my tooth hurts
If you down then I'm down to just jump off a cliff and end it, but you first
My label got me feeling like I'm just a flop profit
Giving me limits, telling me my only market is Hot Topic
And they will not stop it
It's like they cock blockin'
And only meals I ever fucking eat is Hot Pockets

[Hook: Hopsin]
See when I get this low (low)
I wonder why my parents even bothered to have me (who knows)
I'm unhappy
Never laughing
Feeling crappy
I wish someone would run up and just stab me
But then again I don't want to die (no)
I don't want to lose my life
But at the same time
I won't pretend that everything's fine
You love your life but I hate mine

[Verse 2: Kombine]
I hate my life
There ain't nothing I'm doing that's right
I really wish that I was dead and seeing the light
And all these things that always happen to me
They got me wanting to hang myself from my family tree
I've had it with me
I feel this way passionately
But I won't do it cause someday I'll blow up nationally
I've got these crazy fucking thoughts coming right out of my mouth
You say I'm never gonna blow up so I'll blow up your house
I'm gonna get ya
I'm gonna leave you still like a picture
That's Mr. Meanie Man and yeah I'm fucking coming to get you
I really hate myself but I just hate you some more
Your neck is like a stolen Honda because I'm chopping a cord
And do you get it?
You know that Kombizzle is with it
I never come short, you know that I will never go midget
But if my life don't change quick then I will probably be dead
Oh fuck it, I just want to live and make this music instead

[Hook]

[Verse 3: GrewSum]
Life is shitty when you ain't got no label to fund
Any of the albums you release so you stay on the run
Looking for markets to promote you there's basically none
And making one all by myself I'm not capable of
But still I try and we made a little something from nothing
But no money is coming in and I'm struggling, wondering
When the fuck will it change
Feeling stuck in the game
With no bucks and no change
Nothing but fucking complaints
And suicide ain't an option because I have a kid
And I want him to be proud of some shit that daddy did
So I just have to rip beats apart for cash to spend
Charging less than half of what I'm worth just to traffic them
There ain't no laughing, friend
This ain't a laughing matter
When you rapping, mastering mix, and do graphics after
And then press and promote
It's stressful I know
What's impressive is hope is the thing that gets you to cope

[Hook]
