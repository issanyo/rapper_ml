[Intro]
SwizZzzz!
SwizZzzz!
SwizZzzz!

[Verse 1: SwizZz]
Heh, and I thought you knew
SwizZzle official, watch what I can do (Heh!)
New school era, new school moves
Old school flavor, it's Funk Volume (Hah!)
Now I never knew I would grow to be
Something this world has never seen
But with a little bit of trust and a little bit of will
Out came the monster, motherfucker let's kill! (Woah!)
Now I wanna see how you move to this
Do you work it like a motherfuckin' lunatic?
Or do you shake it like a right hand?
I don't really understand why you can't stand
The last shot girly I'll be down, but it's okay though
Gimme a little water, I'll be back in the game yo
The rhymes don't stop, little homie cool it off
If it ain't about money then why would you talk?

[Hook: Hopsin]
Hey yo! (Hey!)
Hey yo! (Hey!)
Hey yo! (Hey!)
Hey yo! (Hey!)
I wanna see you do somethin'
You thought you'd never do (Right!)
Hit the floor hurry up! (Ok!)
Turn the lights out it's goin' down!
Ma-ma-make it ramble, make it whack
Make it ramble, make it wh-whack
Ma-ma-ma ramble ramble
Make it whack, whack, whack, whack!
(GO!)

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
Now stop the commotion
SwizZzle's still here, now let's keep it goin'
(Nah!) Party over there, but I prefer it on the West
It's not a coast thing, it's just what I know best (Yup!)
Throw it up now, dubs in the sky
Embedded as a code, I'ma rep it till I die!
This man's weird, I mean look at this guy! (Huh)
So much ice he'll make a grown man cry (What?)
We're in a re-session, why even lie?
You're a ostrich, you'll never be fly!
Make it rain that's really not right
I'll snatch your chain and flip your bride!
Zip your pride, homie I does it
I got a little Swayze in me, I'm buzzin'
Let me beat down the beat
Chris Brown the beat, you know how it be! (Uh-huh!)

[Hook: Hopsin]
Hey yo! (Hey!)
Hey yo! (Hey!)
Hey yo! (Hey!)
Hey yo! (Hey!)
I wanna see you do somethin'
You thought you'd never do (Right!)
Hit the floor hurry up! (Ok!)
Turn the lights out it's goin' down!
Ma-ma-make it ramble, make it whack
Make it ramble, make it wh-whack
Ma-ma-ma ramble ramble
Make it whack, whack, whack, whack!
(GO!)

[Verse 3: SwizZz]
Now here we go
Back for the 3rd you already know (Yup!)
Somethin' like a oven on way too cold!
Black and gold that C.E.O. (What?)
Can't get it, come and fuck with it
Stacks large moms, arsons, and big digits
I know you've never seen it like that
Turn somethin' from nothin', bake it, make it from scratch! (Yeah!)
And scratch these nuts, bitch!
Peep how I look in the cut, bitch!
Get a blunt light it up, bitch!
Get a bottle, get lit, get drunk, bitch!
It's too late to worry you
Your adolescent curfew does not concern me (Nah!)
But your attitude really disturbs me
Now let's hit the flo', I know you heard me!

[Hook: Hopsin]
Hey yo! (Hey!)
Hey yo! (Hey!)
Hey yo! (Hey!)
Hey yo! (Hey!)
I wanna see you do somethin'
You thought you'd never do (Right!)
Hit the floor hurry up! (Ok!)
Turn the lights out it's goin' down!
Ma-ma-make it ramble, make it whack
Make it ramble, make it wh-whack
Ma-ma-ma ramble ramble
Make it whack, whack, whack, whack!
(GO!)
