[Verse 1]
Take a pen and write my feelings on a notepad
I need to show the people that I can be so bad when I get in my flow jabs
And If I get a fucking chance to do it professionally I'ma grab it and show the people how to do it
Nope I ain’t leaving riddles you can say that I be clueless
And if everybody can do it then why don't they just fucking do it
You'll be saying you’ll be too ruthless do you think I'm that stupid
Punchline for you I'ma punch you teeth out to get a chance with a fairy even if I leave you fucking toothless
Don't fuck with my movement
Cause it's time to improve it
It's time to write rhymes and get high and start to levitate
Cause in this rap shit I ain't gon never break
This rap shit I will never fake
This rap shit is what I take
No drugs only the fucking bass
And rappers I beat em in the fucking face
Go ahead I ain't scared for a case
This is my place
This is my domain and without it I feel like I can drain
Fuck explain I got no pain and the first rapper in SA and I’ll remain
And I will reign and if you wanna take me on you must got no brains
I’ll find a way to tell them straight that I ain't a dude that you can fuck with
I get it you think you the best
But you never met me nigga don’t fucking test
In the flows I'm the best with the hoes I do it less
Fuck the dough and all the checks
Yes I'm cold but I'm dropping fire with no fucking stress
I be passionate bout my holy shits and yes I be blessed

[Hook]
Nowadays rapping is all about fashion
Nowadays it’s all about getting cash and
Rollies and ice and you like to pay the price
That shit is really fucking average but fuck that
I'ma do some motherfucking damage
Fuck that I'ma claim my right of passage
Fuck that I'ma show them that I am a savage
By fucking delivering my motherfucking passion
I'ma show you my passion
Nigga

[Verse 2]
This the time you gotta be blasting me
And harassing me Cause I be getting radically so good I'm gonna be passing me
Cause there ain't nobody in front of me
They'll be saying they mad at me
I'm savagely admitting that I am a beast
Who kills the beats and praise defeat
And whose always coming with the heat
And these rappers is fucking obsolete and off the beat but they ain't never been really neat
They take the backseat and very fucking close to retreat but they can't even do that right man I love it
So they my feast they looking like a treat so I'ma take my seat man I'm hungry
Nope I don't like to play games
When you see me acting playful that's when I control all you idiots cause I can
And nope I ain't really insane
I'm just inside my mind cause I can't come out cause even I am fan
And yep I am inhumane
Cause I'm viciously flowing just so you can say damn
I ain't gon try to be man just to get the fucking cash
And count it up like I was good in math and if anybody really ask
If I did some grass just tell em I was dared by a pshychopath
But I gave him a happy ending in a fucking bloody bath
That's a blood bath
Nobody can stop me
Only bitches can but after this fuckery nobody can top me
And the only people that got me is aunty and mommy
But they don't know bout my hobby
I'ma get killed for this hobby so back to the grinding
And back to the smoking so the weed I be hiding
They don't know that with this rap shit I can be providing
All about the sex talk they don't know that all these bitches can get to riding
But before I talk to mommy I'm still be deciding if I can thrive in this rap shit
One shot, I don't really miss, bitch
All you people acting like you woke
Acting like every opportunity what you got is what you toke
That shit just makes me angry and you don't wanna see me provoked
Cause how you claim to know it all but you still young dumb and broke
My mind is an island and hip hop is the boat
Just to get me out of my mind and I ain't really shy but I won't talk to a bitch to change who I am cause Fuck hoes
I pull up with my momma, aunty and cousins
With all respect I love em
With all respect I trust em
With all respect I'll give my life to every single one of them
That's that family talk
And if anybody wanna take me on you can just give me a knock
Cause who turns down a battle and I'll do anything just to get all of you fucking idiots shocked
Cause my passion I fucking unlocked
And I think I'ma cause a tsunami cause all these flows is fucking overstocked
Woah
All these bitches that's hating I'll give them the cock
Woah
All these bitches that don't even know me them I fucking stalk
Woah
Yeah you should know that all this rap shit I got it all on lock
Woah

[Verse 3]
With all the fucking rappers out at where I live can your careers just fucking die
Oh, I'm sorry I forgot, your careers never even was fucking alive
But you niggas been doing this shit since last year July and still going hard, but why ?
I get it life's full addiction and not enough people got the wisdom and that shit makes me wanna cry
But I'm
Gonna teach all of you motherfuckers what matters in life and let all of you strive
Going on a ride, flowing like I'm high, Spreading all my lies
But I
Didn't even mean that
Way back when I was as big a knee pad
I really think that that era was real rap
But now the people is rapping to get the money and spend cash
So why should I be different cause I don't brag whenever I reach a milestone and don't post it and tag all of my eenie meenie small fans
I really hate life, I wish I was a doormat
Cause people is walking over me so that's why I snatched a plan
I'm gonna be getting famous and be spitting in their faces while I throw all of my models in a shitty fucking minivan
Who counts the killings I'm feeling like I'm near a million with children next on my list
But I need to rape that fucking bitch cause I need to look out for her cause when I be famous she can sue me and she can be rich
Who be offending shit like this I torture my dick by fucking people with a stick
And when she asks me for a kiss I'ma make her blow me like it's a wish(with the stick though)
And if anybody wanna deep throat I'll call them cause I need a real reason to show them what is my motherfucking passion and asking god what's the answer
So I asked my brother did you get the hint though
