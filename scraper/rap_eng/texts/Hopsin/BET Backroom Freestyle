[Verse 1]
Yo, I stepped in the backroom so I can wile out some
You know that I'm ill, I ain't just thinking out loud bruh
Call me King Hop, the one you need to bow down to
I keep em' popping up just like the hair on Alfalfa
Yeah this nigga is raw, you ain't seen nobody spitting this hard from the West Coast since Kendrick Lamar
You MCs with predictable bars who thinking you invincible just might get kicked in your jaw
Somebody hit the alarm
The world is 'bout to hear my flow roar
Got these other rappers sweating bricks and feeling so sore
Niggas like "Oh Lord, this guy Hopsin goes hard
Fuck Obama and Romney, he's the one we should vote for"
So trash anything that ain't me cuz this is music
So cold you need a sweater when you listen to it
I'll be getting stupid and spitting fluent moving the gripping units while whipping through this industry cuz my shit is ruthless
Yeah this kid is foolish, ghetto with his pants saggin
Stopping me there ain't no chance at it, it just can't happen
I got fans stacking all across the globe all because the flow homie, even your mama hopped on the bandwagon
Cuz last year I had a great summer
You're mother made supper, and afterwords I got some brains from her
But she was clingy so I changed numbers
I left a sorry note under your bunk bed that she was banged under
Man it's a cold ass world but the core's hot
I don't follow rules at home, my ways are so unorthodox
One time I was in my room bored and found some porn to watch and dad caught me jacking off because I left the door unlocked
Fuck, my mind is all twisted
I spread peanut butter all across my balls and let my dog lick it
Remain calm snitches
I'm not supposed to be cussing this song, so promise me you won't let my mom listen
Yo, all you rappers seem a bit fake
Man, I should "Human Centipede" both of your lips around my dick base
Snap your mixtape, stab your rib cage, and take my skateboard and rub your face across the grip tape
I've been this sick for years and you're alive to witness it
Uh, I puts it down like somebody caught me stealing it
I'm looking for a mil to get, crazy but I'm still legit
You can't avoid me now, I'm everywhere, you gotta deal with it

[Outro]
Yeah, Hopsin
