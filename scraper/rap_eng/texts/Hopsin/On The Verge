[Verse 1: Phillie Tha Kyd]
I'm just a loser who's abused the rap game
Walk around confused like Phillie is that my rap name?
They say I'm crazy baby, you wouldn't know
Before you get trapped in a back room when I'm slashing your throat
Nope, that's a joke, hope you don't mind
Searchin' in my style and dope you going to find
I'm just a lunatic, maniac, crazy man
Stabbing the fuck out of a box of Raisin Bran (cereal killer)
Two bigass scoops of moral fiber
Chewin' lines of Tony of Tony than does a tiger
And I'm great, they call me the frostflake
You watch your body parts as they get spread across the lake
I'll stake you to a cross, dammit for Christ's sake
Gonna invite you back to my place to eat some rice cake
Phillie's with a rap mixed into a light base
Not only the rock dose, but just the right taste

[Hook: Phillie Tha Kyd]
It's like I've been here for way too long
But people keep on singing my songs
So how the fuck am I supposed to walk away
When I feel like I'm on the verge of being great
It's like I've been here for way too long
But people keep on singing my songs
So how the fuck am I supposed to walk away
When I feel like I'm on the verge of being great

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Who wanna deal with a beast, I'm realer than cheese
Charging out the ass like a million in piece
For one verse, my guts yearn for killing emcees
I crush earth, you must learn the illest is me
Homie, look at my buzz build in the streets
I'm putting in work daily, I'm even grinding when your children asleep
Now you see me, I'm as real as can be
I make my competition climb up to a motherfucking building and leap
My personality, minus it seems
But when you ain't looking your girl is on my penis trying to polish it clean
I'm the most psychotic, obscene, hot and supreme
Nigga droppin' 16's, my goal is to demolish your dreams
I'm a machine and you a fuckin' plastic toy
It's in my programming to leave your fuckin' ass destroyed
And that's the joy, I get on any track that I win dudes on
When I eat 'em, I dip 'em in grey poupon, tell 'em!

[Hook: Phillie Tha Kyd]

[Verse 3: Phillie Tha Kyd]
It's like I walk around in payback mode
How far can I go, they don't wanna pave that road
And I don't know what it is that they take me for
Can't slow my roll, can't even tape my show
You think it's funny, don't even make that joke
Cause I don't want this knife to have to scrape that throat
So believe me, you don't wanna take that boat
Guaranteed cement shoes canâ€™t make you float
I'm just a murderous cat killer, a villain of rap
Flavor of the week, I'm vanilla in fact
I scream for my team, they yellin' it back
So many thoughts in my head, I'm friggin' villainous cap
You watch it overflow as it spills in a rap
It's like we at you when, storm Helen attacked
And while your CD sits and melts on a shelf in the back
I'm here to put Street Kings and myself on the map (Fuck y'all!)

[Hook]
