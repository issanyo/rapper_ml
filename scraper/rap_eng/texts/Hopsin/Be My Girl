[Intro]
Alright let see if I can pull this off
Girl I just wanna be wit' you I hope you never leave
Nah I didn't like that man
Throw more doubles in there
(oh girl I really need you)
Maybe instead with the doubles throw like seventy of them in there
Your the girl I be dreaming of
Alright that's cool
Let me start the rush right now

[Verse 1]
It's like you turn me to a better man
The times that we spend together sometimes I just wish they'd never end
You make me want to settle in
Shit, I be thankful keeping our relationship with each other as just a friend
I'm complete now that you came along
You made me whole
Your spectacular beauty is 'bout as great as gold
This ain't a joke
You'll never know what you do to me
And I'ma always be happy just as long as you cool with me
Forget those women that I used to like
I'm wanting you up in my life so baby let's make it you and I
We could find a place to chill
And I'd be lying to you if I said that I couldn't explain the way I feel
When you gave me your number it was a thrill
I'm just being real
You get me hyper, I think I need my pills
I wanna be the man that's taking you out
It don't seem like it, but you the woman I be thinking about

[Chorus]
Girl I just wanna be wit' you I hope you never leave
Please don't go and pick another man instead of me
'Cause you're the woman I be thinking of
I be dreaming of, I just need your love (Oh girl)
I just wanna be wit' you I hope you never leave
Please don't go and pick another man instead of me
'Cause you're the woman I be thinking of
I be dreaming of, so be my girl

[Verse 2]
I feel some chemistry, all I can do is hope you feel it
I'm feeling your style more than before the more we kick it
So shorty dig it, you come one of a kind
And when I'm chilling up at my crib you just run through my mind
You the only girl that's up in my rhymes that's not being dissed
What could be better than receiving this?
A track made for you specifically
Not just so you could get with me
So you could understand how my feelings be
I act like nothings going on when you ride with me
But deep down inside it be eating the fuck outta me
And honestly, I just gotta be honest with you
I ain't been the same ever since I was caught up with you
Just let me know if I be bothering you
I leave from outta your life
Hop in my ride
Push, and be outta your sight
But my heart would probably blow up
Shit, but so what
I can't hide the fact that your the girl I like so much

[Chorus]
Girl I just wanna be wit' you I hope you never leave
Please don't go and pick another man instead of me
'Cause you're the woman I be thinking of
I be dreaming of, I just need your love (Oh girl)
I just wanna be wit' you I hope you never leave
Please don't go and pick another man instead of me
'Cause you're the woman I be thinking of
I be dreaming of, so be my girl

[Verse 3]
I'm finna explain the reason I'm liking you, so listen
Most women choose not to kick it with me but you was different
Now understand what I'm saying now
You even hang around me when your girlfriends ain't around
That's the type of stuff I think about
But I keep it inside
You ain't the kinda girl that'd just go use me for a ride
You do it 'cause I'm the person you feel like being with at that time
And I ain't even got a problem wit' it, that's fine
But I just want you to know
That I don't want you to go
And if you leave, I want you even more
But I'll probably be hurt worse
I feel like my life has hit the dirt
But that's just the way that the earth works
I wish I hadn't of wrote the first, second or third verses
To this song
And wish I was the first who was gone
I been trying this hard to keep it a secret
But you the only girl up in this world I wanna be with

[Chorus]
Girl I just wanna be wit' you I hope you never leave
Please don't go and pick another man instead of me
'Cause you're the woman I be thinking of
I be dreaming of, I just need your love (Oh girl)
I just wanna be wit' you I hope you never leave
Please don't go and pick another man instead of me
'Cause you're the woman I be thinking of
I be dreaming of, so be my girl
Girl I just wanna be wit' you I hope you never leave
Please don't go and pick another man instead of me
'Cause you're the woman I be thinking of
I be dreaming of, I just need your love (Oh girl)
I just wanna be wit' you I hope you never leave
Please don't go and pick another man instead of me
'Cause you're the woman I be thinking of
I be dreaming of, so be my girl

[Outro]
I don't give a fuck
I still eat y'all fools on the mic
