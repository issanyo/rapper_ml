[Intro]
Yeah, Funk Volume, yeah

[Verse]
Yo, never had a family to turn to
Bag of weed to burn through,
So me gettin' famous, this shit I actually deserve to
Horrific nightmares with fantasies to serve you
Act like a psycho, I got the nerve to
How come it's always about bitches, and talking about riches
And walking it out, this is me chalkin' em' out
Witness provocative sounds, disses I'm tossin' around
Mission is knocking em' down, this shit is causing the drought
Isn't it boggling how, one nigga can be so dope?
But never get promoted, answer that, cause he don't know
And he's so broke, that he can't even eat no mo'
Behind on all of his bills, because his cheese don't grow
My life is usually harsh, I got a bruise on my heart
That's why my music is dark, I gotta do it its part
Of this reason that I was put on this planet we call earth
Hopefully in the end I see what it was all worth

[Outro]
Do you recall when I was down? Screamin' out but you were not around..
Bitch I'll see you in hell! I can't believe you left me hanging

You make me angry
