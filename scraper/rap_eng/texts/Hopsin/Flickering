[Verse 1: Hopsin]
So how would you react if I was to tell you that I was gonna die right now
And how would you react if you were the one who put me onto this lifestyle
Kept cool for a longass minute
Shotgun the anger then hopped back in it
I didn't want to do it, it was your fault
You were cold dog, I don't like you and I admit it
What would you do if I died punk
I bet money you would not cry punk
And if I did die and you happen to show up to my funeral
I know you'd be lookin' at your time punk
Tryin' to see when I leave
Hopin' they hurry and put me underneath
I'm strugglin' to see a real reason to be
But I can't that's the reason I'm weak
Fuck increasin' the peace
If you do you wanna die tonight
I'ma walk into a building holding a stick of dynamite
And now it's time to fight
I'ma wreck every nigga I come across
Until I see no sign of life
Is this what you wanted to see
People yellin', people screamin'
Lord knows I'm oh so satisfied
Is this what you wanted from me
I'm so sorry my dog, but this is just a game that you lost

[Hook]
I can't explain why I'm surrounded by candlelights
And all of you oughta be crying
Sharing memories of me
Can't whisper goodbye
Just flickering candlelights
And all of you oughta be gasping
Over this empty shell of me

[Verse 2: Yas Talaat]
I got a pistol named crystal, last name meth
She loves me and needs me but leaves me depressed
My friends say she feeds me death, but leaves me a pale
Skin rail thin zombie
She kills but calms me, thrills but haunts me, wants me
To never leave her side so I swallow my pride
Along with a razor blade tied to a pharma-
Ceutical attached to my unusual beautiful depression
Matched by a suicide obsession
Chop like the pains, so many cobains
Bangs of cocaine, sang with a propane
Rain with a gun cocked and aimed at my no name
Lame physical frame tie a noose let it hang
With a suicidal note and a sentimental quote sayin'
Sorry for this rope around my throat gotta let it choke
See you at the funeral
Death is love, in quotes

[Hook]
I can't explain why I'm surrounded by candlelights
And all of you oughta be crying
Sharing memories of me
Can't whisper goodbye
Just flickering candlelights
And all of you oughta be gasping
Over this empty shell of me

Don't cry, I'm in the lights, the broken lights don't cry
I miss you all, goodbye
Don't cry, apologize, I filled your life
Now I'm trapped in broken lights, and broken lies
Goodbye, you all, a good goodbye
Goodbye, you all, a good goodbye
Goodbye, you all, a good goodbye
Goodbye, you all, a good goodbye
Time to go to sleep
Bury the machines will the free not see tomorrow
Flickering lights, sickening sights in my mind 'cause I can't take no more
Time to go to sleep
Bury the machines will the free not see tomorrow
Flickering lights, sickening sights in my mind 'cause I can't take no more
