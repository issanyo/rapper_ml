Hopsin: Hm, well alright!

[Chorus]
She tryin' to make a little money on the side
Eye on the prize
She out there whorin', she's just tryin' to get by
For that money on the side
There's no surprise
She's just tryin' to get by, oh I know
This ho lookin' for dollars
This ho lookin' for dollars
This ho lookin' for dollars
This ho lookin' for dollars
This ho lookin' for dollars
This ho lookin' for dollars
She's just tryin' to get by, oh I know

[Verse 1]
Nineteen, hmm, pretty young thing from the Midwest (oh yes)
Got a long week ahead of her
When I call she gets dressed (she dressed)
Her ditsy mind and her ass, I'm impressed (I am)
I fly her into Burbank for one thing, it's sex (alright)
She does whatever I want her to when I want her to (yikes)
I'm divin' into her number one and her number two (yikes)
If I go too long without gettin' it I'ma get sick (I will)
I fly her out often like, "Bitch, come get this chocolate dick!" (yikes)
No music, I wanna hear me make her yell (oh)
She don't complain, 'cause she knows the deal
'Cause I pay her well (I do)
She struggle with cash and I stress a lot, so it's easy, bro (it is)
Bitch, you know damn well
I need you and you need me, ho (don't lie)
Look, little nasty chick, her ass is thick
I hit it from the back and shit
I packed the dick deep into the pussy
She ain't never gonna find a nigga like me after this (after this)
Fabulous, sexual activist
She as good as I imagined it
I'm drawn to her like a magnet
Nigga don't trip, 'cause she asked for this

[Chorus]
She tryin' to make a little money on the side (hmm)
Eye on the prize (yeah)
She out there whorin', she's just tryin' to get by (tryin' to get by)
For that money on the side (yeah)
There's no surprise (no surprise)
She's just tryin' to get by, oh I know
This ho lookin' for dollars (yeah)
This ho lookin' for dollars (yeah)
This ho lookin' for dollars (yeah)
This ho lookin' for dollars (yeah)
This ho lookin' for dollars (yeah)
This ho lookin' for dollars (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Hm! She got a man and I have a girl, I know (I know)
So everything we do, we just keep it on the low (the low)
We don't leave the house
We don't go to dinner, 'cause I grocery shop (I do)
She'll cook a meal for both of us
Then let me down and blow me hot (yikes)
I hit it about five times a day, yes I'm proud (so proud)
When she's in my house, she knows no clothes allowed (uh uh)
No, her man calls, I move to the next room (uh oh)
If he finds out what we just did, oh my god, boom! (yikes)
I messed with it, I hit it raw when I murked her hole
True, no kids for me, she's on that birth control (alright)
I slap the bitch then I choke her down when we fuck, ooh (alright)
I spit on her, then she spit on me, it's a must do (hell)
No shiners (no shiners)
I'll be suckin' on her titty and I'll bite it (bite it)
Stick a finger in her booty and she like it (like it)
I'll look at her in the eyes when I pipe it (pipe it)
She my little filthy white chick (chick), my sidekick (sidekick)
That pussy's priceless (priceless)
She flies home when I'm done and stays silent

[Chorus]
She tryin' to make a little money on the side (hmm)
Eye on the prize (yeah)
She out there whorin', she's just tryin' to get by
For that money on the side (yeah)
There's no surprise (no surprise)
She's just tryin' to get by, oh I know
This ho lookin' for dollars (yeah)
This ho lookin' for dollars (yeah)
This ho lookin' for dollars (yeah)
This ho lookin' for dollars (yeah)
This ho lookin' for dollars (yeah)
This ho lookin' for dollars (yeah)
She's just tryin' to get by, oh I know
