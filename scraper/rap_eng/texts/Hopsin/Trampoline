[Intro]
Get it, yeah
Where it's at, right here, yeah
Now

[Verse 1]
I'm the rap maniac with the hooligan eyes
Who's cooler than I? Whack niggas move it aside
When you heard I was a big deal you were surprised
West coast bitch, put ya W's in the sky
I spent my days as a refugee
'Til the rap game came to rescue me
And left my wrist paved in accessories
A dangerous necessity, I came here to wreck emcees
You're wrong if you thinking Wayne was the recipe
Nah, he ain't worthy of that, the controversy is back
Get out the Kool Aid, stir me a batch
See I prefer to relax but I can't and God knows it
Gotta stay raw with the flow that I'm diagnosed with
Oh shit, niggas keep fucking with my emotions
Maybe that's the reason that I suffer from psychosis
Shocking as high voltage, fuck it, my life's hopeless
So I had to make sure I killed it when I wrote this

[Hook]
Hop can probably make them bounce
Hop can probably make them bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make them bounce
Hop can probably make them bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make them bounce
Hop can probably make them bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make them bounce
Hop can probably make them bounce
Like a trampoline

[Verse 2]
Bounce like a trampoline, thousands that's amped as me
Kids run up on your school campus slap a dean
I grew up on baggy jeans, pornographic nasty dreams
Moral of my damn story life, isn't a happy scene
Wish I was stacking cream, wish I had a Lamborghini
Wish I had the cover on a Rolling Stones magazine
I'm sick of the radio playing all these faggot teens
Keep it real, show me something ill that I haven't seen
For ten years I've been working on ill flows
And finally got a fucking record deal and I'm still broke
Man that's not common, bombs that I'm dropping
Are dope, but all that I can afford is some Top Ramen
I notice that ya'll niggas like to dumb the stats
I should stomp your ass out until your lungs collapse
No more corny cowabunga rap, we done with that
It's a wrap, keep it up and get your tongue detached
Come on

[Hook]
Hop can probably make them bounce
Hop can probably make them bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make them bounce
Hop can probably make them bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make them bounce
Hop can probably make them bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make them bounce
Hop can probably make them bounce
Like a trampoline

[Verse 3]
I'm the last of a dying breed, Hip-Hop lacks a variety
That's the reason I thrash on society
I get laughed at when I clash with a robbery
Until they feel the wrath when I smash on their dynasty
But I ain't Hollywood, I'm still the same kid
Up on the same shit, rapping in the basement
Catch me at your local school, skating, busting tre flips
Left shoe lace ripped, you know how them days get
Listen while the bass hit, the only thing that changed is
The way that girls act, 'cause now they think I'm amazing
I used to be the nigga chicks didn't wanna hang with
Sitting alone with a Capri Sun and raisins
My senior year in highschool I was always truant
Had a lot of homework but I would never do it
Screw it, I'm the king now, homie take a bow
You need the crowd jumping? I could probably make 'em bounce

[Hook]
Hop can probably make them bounce
Hop can probably make them bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make them bounce
Hop can probably make them bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make them bounce
Hop can probably make them bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make them bounce
Hop can probably make them bounce
Like a trampoline
