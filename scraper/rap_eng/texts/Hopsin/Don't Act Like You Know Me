[Intro]
Yo, I got something to say
To all my homies out there
Every single last one of 'em

[Hook]
Don't be acting like you know me
There's a lot of shit I hear up
Even though you've been my homie
I ain't saying I'm an OG
I'm just saying that you've only seen half
And not the whole me

[Verse 1]
I been through a lot of shit (yup), nah I ain't proud of it (uh-uh)
Most of the time you won't even hear a word out my mouth of it (nah)
Jail time, fat pregnant bitch, getting outta shit
Conning nigga, special ed school kicked out of it
Suicide'll moves plus I was diagnosed with
Something called ADHD and psychosis
I prayed to God, Jesus Christ even tried Moses
I'm a grown man and don't know what my goals is
[?] in front of the crowds then start smiling
Then go home turn out the light to start crying
Acting like I'm cool but really my heart's frying
Getting to the point I want niggas to start dying (FUCK!)
Thinking I'm the illest MC and I'm hot
Pretending that I'm feeling your style, but I'm not
Talking about my own best homies non-stop
Rapping is it for the fine girls love Hop, man

[Hook]
Don't be acting like you know me
There's a lot of shit I hear up
Even though you've been my homie
I ain't saying I'm an OG
I'm just saying that you've only seen half
And not the whole me
Don't be acting like you know me
There's a lot of shit I hear up
Even though you've been my homie
I ain't saying I'm an OG
I'm just saying that you've only seen half
And not the whole me

[Verse 2]
I haven't been through a lot of shit, relationships, colleges
Have a happy home 'cause my parents steady hollering
Raised with no money had to struggle for a dollar rent
Eating foods like Vienna sausage's by the can
Women not dating me 'cause I ain't acting like a man
Then the next day I walk around acting like I am (How you doin'?)
I be faking like I got feelings for none of 'em
When really every time I meet one I fall in love with 'em
Beatboxing, being robots to get attention
Everything is been true of all the shit I mention
End of every high school year I get extensions
Just so kids can clown me and I could be in detention
Homies getting on my nerves who act like they're the bestest
But if I get a record deal, their asses getting left quick (Peace!)
Now most of y'all niggas probably hate me
Shit I'm showing you the real me
It's time to stop the fake me

[Hook]
Don't be acting like you know me
There's a lot of shit I hear up
Even though you've been my homie
I ain't saying I'm an OG
I'm just saying that you've only seen half
And not the whole me
Don't be acting like you know me
There's a lot of shit I hear up
Even though you've been my homie
I ain't saying I'm an OG
I'm just saying that you've only seen half
And not the whole me

[Verse 3]
Gone been through a lot of shit, yeah I am proud of it
Ill flow, sick ass beats nobody stopping me
Niggas always told me I was wack and never got to me
They never in they life gonna be as real as Hopsin be
I put my heart, sweat, blood and tears into this rap
Stay in my life throughout the years until these cracks
Just a week ago until you ease and call me wack
I don't give a a fuck I know the kinda shit that I pack
I'm skipping over my tracks 'cause I don't rap batter
But how the 12 gauge I'll make a nigga back shatter
Even his ass packed up but could see me crack splattin'
You thinking I'ma switch my style, nigga won't happen
In this rap game I don't play kid
I fuck around and get my ass wasted
Tryna spit some fake shit
So let me ask you something "What y'all know about Hopsin?"
Nothing, you just know I always drop hot shit

[Hook]
Don't be acting like you know me
There's a lot of shit I hear up
Even though you've been my homie
I ain't saying I'm an OG
I'm just saying that you've only seen half
And not the whole me
Don't be acting like you know me
There's a lot of shit I hear up
Even though you've been my homie
I ain't saying I'm an OG
I'm just saying that you've only seen half
And not the whole me
