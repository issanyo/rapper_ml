[Intro: Ron Jeremy]
Yo
Why the fuck did you let that crazy mother fucker Fury
On this CD
You know all he's gonna do is break shit
And fuck the other rappers moms right?
Oh I see, I see
It's because Hopsin and Lental are on this song to
Well i'll be damned
It was only a matter of time
Before hollywood Hopsin
Hopped on a U.G.H
Yo Marcus
When are you gonna host one
Hit up your uncle Ron Jeremy my man

[Verse 1: Hopsin]
Kid stars they're so dismantled
What happens when the show gets canceled
Let's think up and example hmmm
Both the Olsen twins turned into damn fools
Their childhood got torn out
I heard the girl from Family Matters does porn now
She ain't nothing but a whore wow
But as crazy as that shit is it gets more wild
How?
Cause i've been on disney
Raven before she was a big bone bitch freak
I never knew the shit was so risky
You can even check it out it's on this week
Hey surprise!
I've been paid the price
Now I'm an MC that hates his life
I represent raising blades and knives
So you can't deny that disneys they reason I have rage inside
Come on

[Hook]
It's only a matter
Of time x2

[Verse 2: Fury]
I, Never been in the Mickey Mouse Club
I was brought up ?
Pushin' me to be at the stage my mom was
I'm just tryna get behind the TV of my childhood
Consisted of me being a ? by third grade
Kids would always pick on me it hurt in the worst way
?????
Never hit the big time
Now I spit rhymes wishing I could get the shit right
Never got a script assigned to me
These fucking bitches lie to me
They're just tryna get me in the bed so they can grind on me
I tried to leave but they held me
Switched sides on me it ain't healthy
I'm tryna be what they tell me
Only a matter of time fore they sell me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lental]
I never was a kid star needed more time and
46 down but I'm still going in my prime
I played a few shows had a role in a movie
I wrote a whole book but still no groupies
Never had a box smash
Wasn't in a boy band
Did a little TV maybe get a couple fans
Pick up my guitar and start a mosh pit
Still to this day I ain't never had a pop hit
Played in front of thousands felt like millions
Wait till I'm on scotch ?
Wait till I get money rolling in the dough
Never reach show ?
Wait till I blow like a ticking time bomb
When you come around to see this that ? I'm on
I spread my wings like a black swan
You'll miss me when I'm gone

[Hook]
