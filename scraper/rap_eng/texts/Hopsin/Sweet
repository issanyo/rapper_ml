[Verse 1: D. LYNCH]
Damn, it seems like I've hit my luck
Everyone wants a piece, no one ever gave a fuck
Now all a sudden y'all think you know who Dan is
They listen to Walz, tell 'em which one the man is
Say you fucked D up, get the heaters, squeeze up
Bring that shit to Cali if you feel like getting beat up
For saying this that, hippity hoopla
When fact is my fame's more gangster than you are
Fuck it, I'm gone, I ain't never looking back
Fuck rap, snoke this line off your platinum plaque
Dont know if you're crazy, insane or stupid
Here's some LSD to clear up your confusion
All an illusion, the sun never rose
Pocket all the cash, to leave us all broke
So I guess this is the beginning of the end
Never talk to strangers, never trust a friend (Come on)

[Hook: D. LYNCH]
It don't rise to my feet
Take a sigh of relief
Make you feel incomplete
While you taste the defeat
You become obsolete
They say vengeance is sweet (No shi...)

It don't rise to my feet
Take a sigh of relief
Make you feel incomplete
While you taste the defeat
You become obsolete
They say vengeance is sweet

[Verse 2: D. LYNCH]
I hate rappers who use the word 'pure'
Like hip hop is sick and their rhymes is the cure
You're corny as fuck, that's the only thing for sure
Put down the mic, you ain't twenty anymore
Don't be fooled, kids, it's all a trick
The underground is a bunch of cat, pissed they ain't rich
It's a fans that they diss, when they quick to dismiss
Every motherfucker get a slap on the wrist
Yo dawg, I think I smoked too much
Dudes dope when they go, but he chokes too much
They cut my hands off so I couldn't hold too much
Tryna stand off bleeding while I hold the clutch
Think I expose too much, y'all losing touch
It's a pain of expression that I use to bluff
Fell under a spell, i would cope for months
You keep talking all ya shit while you hold these nuts (Come on)

[Hook: D. LYNCH]
It don't rise to my feet
Take a sigh of relief
Make you feel incomplete
While you taste the defeat
You become obsolete
They say vengeance is sweet (No shi...)

It don't rise to my feet
Take a sigh of relief
Make you feel incomplete
While you taste the defeat
You become obsolete
They say vengeance is sweet

[Verse 3: D. LYNCH]
Get fucked up, say my name again
I ain't here to make friends, what my women in ends
Take you all, bitch, yeah you and your mans
Slitting all your throats, set fire to your Benz
Not crazy insane but insanely crazy
An abortion overdue, yeah fuck you, Katie
My vision is hazy, pushing up daisies
Maybe it's from the pills or maybe I'm just lazy
Fuck me if I'm here, kill me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm near, or fuck 'em when I'm wrong
Severed the head that speaks of the dead
Karma comes with sin, you cheat to get ahead
I'm sure he has a lot of things, a lot of what I lack
Dan's got a peak ahead, his wardrobe is wack
Dates for the head that allowed me to crack
Now I sold my soul, I ain't never get it back

[Hook: D. LYNCH]
It don't rise to my feet
Take a sigh of relief
Make you feel incomplete
While you taste the defeat
You become obsolete
They say vengeance is sweet (No shi...)

It don't rise to my feet
Take a sigh of relief
Make you feel incomplete
While you taste the defeat
You become obsolete
They say vengeance is sweet

It don't rise to my feet
Take a sigh of relief
Make you feel incomplete
While you taste the defeat
You become obsolete
They say vengeance is sweet (No shi...)
