[Verse 1]
Whoa
Uh uh uh bounce bounce
Whats my motha fuckin' name H-E
S-I-N yea yea bounce bounce, come on
The heats on lets go, rock to the hottest beats
On the west coast made by the best yo
Used to move on the ground like the metro
Till' i hoped to the top niggas like heck no
I ain't that nigga on the rap tracks tryin' to front
Like he blast gat's just so i can get the cash fast
I'm the nigga with the mad rap here to take over the game
Yo where the mic nigga pass that
Studio time you think i'm gonna go and find it?
Fuck that I brought the studio to my crib
Gods gift to hop-sin was hot-shit
To toxic for niggas to try and stop this
Yall hating on my ass cuz i can make a nigga bounce
Like he on the block slangin' with cops fast
I keep the ill tracks bangin' in my lab
Any minute you know I'ma be coming in hot stacks

[Hook]
Y'all mine as well call me a motha' fuckin' earthquake cuz
I'll rock you right
Man i was no bitch in the motha' fuckin' first place homie
I'll rock you right
I'm reppin' the Westcoast
You know how i get down when i come around town nigga
Westside (9X)

[Verse 2]
I'm headed for fame and niggas try wreckin' my name
Quit testing me mane impressive you ain't
You'll never be ready see
I ain't lettin' these niggas get rid of me
They can only wish they was ahead of me
That'll be something to look forward to
Do i got the motherfuckin' game locked? of course i do
I'm just waiting for the loot
And for my benefit to be legit to hit it quick
Cuz i want a whole lotta dough not a little bit
Tax fees niggas for money and stack cheese
Cuz I ain't trying to be living bum-my as crack feigns
I be up in the streets runnin' with made fees
Warning the passenger he missed, up in the back seat
They're like what the fuck enough's enough
World gettin' mad cuz they see a nigga coming up
Retarded nigga ready to slaughter niggas
Got your kids looking up to me like i'm a father figure

[Hook]
Y'all mine as well call me a motha' fuckin' earthquake cuz
I'll rock you right
Man i was no bitch in the motha' fuckin' first place homie
I'll rock you right
I'm reppin' the Westcoast
You know how i get down when i come around town nigga
Westside (9X)

[Verse 3]
I got a dangerous mind and i'ma take my time
Until the game is mine, that's how my pace designed homie
The nigga just trying to make it right don't try to take my life
I might have to take your light homie
And i ain't doing this just for the hell of it
I do it cuz it rides so well with my intelligence
That's why i'm in the game heavy like an elephant
My rap rhymes are like a sick nigga's medicine
Go and ask your girlfriend what the finish is
She says it's not me? fuck that, yes it is
The flows tight but homie i got the better shit
They'd rather toss your hits away instead of this
I keep the hot tracks coming in the bundles
And I ain't about to let it all crumble, bounce to this
Put your hands up, stand up, get loud
This motherfucker finna' get wild
Come on

[Hook]
Y'all mine as well call me a motha' fuckin' earthquake cuz
I'll rock you right
Man i was no bitch in the motha' fuckin' first place homie
I'll rock you right
I'm reppin' the Westcoast
You know how i get down when i come around town nigga
Westside (9X)
