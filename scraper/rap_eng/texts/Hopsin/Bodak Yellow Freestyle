[Verse]
The beast lurkin', ain't no peace, so keep searchin'
I rain on beats and leave verdicts
Fuck a shark, bitch, I'm a sea urchin
And this is water you wouldn't wanna go feet first in
You gotta bite like a croc', I'm Steve Irwin
I had to fight for my spot, I deserve it
Look at me rise to the top, I'm emergin'
I ain't gotta tell you to make a CD purchase
It's obvious I body shit, like I got Rocky's fist
I'm not cocky, just confident
I'm on everybody's naughty list
They said my head's too big, and it probably is
I'm sorry kids, but I can't be your role model
Too many pissed MC's we gon' squabble
How can Hop be so nice but so hostile?
He be on the mic just preaching his own gospel
Yeah, the king of rap I rose to that
I'm coming at you with shoulder pads
So you don't end up with a broken back
Stupid hoe, relax, you smoking crack
We swimmin' in loads of cash
So why the fuck you complaining?
I'm moving in on luxury train and
I don't care about what the fuck you be saying
Me and Jamie got the shit on lock, yeah, motherfuckers, we made it
Don't assume I'm Mad and needy
When I cop a new house with a massive TV
Growing up never had it easy
I was sad and needy, can't wait for mom and dad to see me
Yeah, alright, you should be glad I'm eating
Life's hard and I pass the beating
You probably think I own the magic Genie
When I pull up on you niggas in the Lamborghini
Like boy, I been killin' it since high school
I slide through, leave the mic bruised
Back when I couldn't afford nice shoes
Now they all got they eyes glued
I'm quite smooth, you shoulda got a fuckin' collab' before the price do
You better get up your cash before you try to
You stupid niggas ain't mashing with the right crew
The following that you had is finna die soon
I'm 'bout to get me a mansion with a nice view
Watch out, bought a plane ticket to Thailand
For five grand, there's white sand when I land
They'll be looking at me like "Hopsin, my friend! How you make a whole a lot of money like white man?"
Just know I does it, this shit, it's nothing
Ask 'round I buzz to smash down, the sluts and I am erupting
Far from a reluctant bringing the funds in
I love this, you dumb bitch
Who am I? Hope you guessed amazing
Just embrace it, been underestimated
Left for bait, and now I'm 'bout to head to greatness
I gets down like a nigga weapon raisin'
No hesitation with the bad upbringing
You can tell from hotels, I'm sexing babes
And I'm the man that's the best of statements
Now I rest my case, man
Fuck this shit
