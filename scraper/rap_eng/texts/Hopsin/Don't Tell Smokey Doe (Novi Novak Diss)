Yo, I'll do me and you do you
Tell the world how you fake all your Youtube views
Using Wiz Khalifa's name just to boost you through
Not only hoes trip, but apparently you do too

You kinda sick, but homie I'm like the swine flu times two
You wanna take it off tracks? Fuck it. I'll fight you
You stupid as your dumb fan puppets you lie to
Telling them all that Lil wayne wanted to sign you
Bullshit thats a bunch of crap
Theres no proof Wayne gave you a contract
Whats up with that?
And if he did put one up for grabs
You turned it down cause he wouldn't kiss you like he does his dad

Fuckin' fag back down or get burnt quick
You like the confidence I gave you on first diss?
It was on purpose, I knew if I threw the first hit you'd respond
Now I'll prove that you ain't worth shit

Am I a beast? Of course it is true
I strangle Novi in his booth
Using his mic cord as a noose
Board up your room, you're doomed
By my whole rep of tunes
And soon
Your fans gonn' turn on you
Like some wicked goons

I don't care to pull your card, you deserve it
You're the reason white rappers have it so hard
You actin' tougher than a
Nappy afro that won't part, but you're like a mannequin, all body with no heart
Your whole game is whack, Novi Novak?
C'mon, be real.. what kinda name is that?
You a shameless act, who's lame, infact
You try to gain fame
Pretend like you were raised with blacks

Black psychos? You're glad I can't be called that
I'm only crazy over Raw tracks
But you ain't nuts either nigga, so fall back
Closest thing you ever been to nuts is lickin' your daddy's ballsack

You bullshittin' sayin' Hop sucks
You smoke a lot, but I'm one hit of dope you should not puff
Ya I heard your diss, it was hot stuff
I see you Googled my name
I tried yours, nothing popped up
You act like you the hugest star
You strung out like a used guitar
You couldn't get a hit standing in front of a moving car
The only time you tour is at an amusement park

Stop denying it you can't hold me
The flow is nastier than anchovies
Don't be up at my show in Chicago tryna act like you my damn homie
Fuck Swag City followers, and Novi
