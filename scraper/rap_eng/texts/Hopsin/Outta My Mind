[Chorus: Nobe]
When I was young, my heart was cold
They said I was out of the line
Now I'm all grown up with no soul
And they say that I'm outta my mind
When I was young, my heart was cold
They said I was out of the line
Now I'm all grown up with no soul
And they say that I'm outta my mind

[Verse 1: Nobe]
I set my optic to psychotic, my nightmare's a bionic
That's why I sleep with the lights on, it's ironic
These psychologist pills it's getting quite costly
Along with the biopsies
Barely telling they try to understand a monster
Mary Shelley could put me behind the bars like Machiavelli
Demons in my head, telling me the reasons swear to killing
Find out my first victim, and leaving 'em for dead
Hoping the police and feds, can leave me with the black light
And and find the semen all ahead
'cause [?] stepped too far, [?] body parts under the futon
Bad looking like it's covered in ketchup and grey poupon
Then I have to pack up and move on
Change my identity and disappear with time
But maybe I'm just outta my mind

[Chorus: Nobe]
When I was young, my heart was cold
They said I was out of the line
Now I'm all grown up with no soul
And they say that I'm outta my mind
When I was young, my heart was cold
They said I was out of the line
Now I'm all grown up with no soul
And they say that I'm outta my mind

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
I'm far from being mature, retarded being for sure
Walked inside of a club and they carded me at the door
Life isn't going great so I'm arguing with the Lord
Fame isn't far away, but it's hard to see when you're poor
Pardon me, I'm a dork, I know it, it's nuttin new
In school I would pick up apples and throw 'em at substitutes
Got a record with the law, I'm hoping to cut it loose
And gain a little respect by exposing the fuckin' truth
My thoughts are every disgusting, you'll open it up and puke
Fat bitches who wearing a coat and some buckle boots
Holding a cup of juice, while I'm boning a bunch of oo's
Then moving to the next 'cause there's so many sluts to choose
Homie, what's up wit' you? How was your life been?
Mine is a journey that's taking me on a nice spin
And I'm glad but yet I got ninety-percent white friends
Because my own kind talking 'bout "We don't like him"

[Chorus: Nobe]
When I was young, my heart was cold
They said I was out of the line
Now I'm all grown up with no soul
And they say that I'm outta my mind
When I was young, my heart was cold
They said I was out of the line
Now I'm all grown up with no soul
And they say that I'm outta my mind

[Verse 3: Katz]
I'm on my rocker ready to get it in [?]
The crazy citizen is back
Leaving woman in this track
So as I tell it like a fact
Do white elephant will rap
My side is television black, as intelligent is that
So what the fuck I'm might to do
Infected by the swine flu
Speed and pass the limit like my fortune turn into iron boots
Who the fuck you lying to
I'm here to take your shit
Like a giant roof while I'm strapped with a line suit
Searching to find the truth, hurting to feel the happiness
The pain is gladly missed as soon as they pass the fifth
See do it like  a [?] maybe even laugh at this
Scared step and packing shit, check it like you have to piss
Your heart might be cold, but mine is in the deep breeze
Locked in cylinder with dry ice and sea breeze
I can't decide what causes bra fitting arteries
Mine's lost with an artist he might not make it hard to breathe

[Chorus: Nobe]
When I was young, my heart was cold
They said I was out of the line
Now I'm all grown up with no soul
And they say that I'm outta my mind
When I was young, my heart was cold
They said I was out of the line
Now I'm all grown up with no soul
And they say that I'm outta my mind
