[Verse 1]
Hopsin smooth cat don't you knew that?
Move back 'fore these niggas come with the [?]
Loose cats if you ask you right get
A few clap and few [?] a night again
Start jumpin' it's the shit that get your heart pumpin'
Women looking at me like they about ready to start something
It's enough ease up [?]
And surprise there somebody try to fuck [?] (aight)
Used to spit wack 'til the nigga come up
When I come through niggas get your game up
Brothers is tired of hearing the same stuff
That's when Hopsin step then (nigga say what?)
I'll be on the block kickin' them rhymes
Sick with the Nine same spot where they committin' the crimes and
Same spot where they spittin' the nines
Same spot where the niggas love chicken I ain't trippin' nigga
Let's go

[Hook]
Get ready 'cause the party is here
If you leave this motherfucker you gon' hardly hear
You don't like the way it's getting, man I'm sorry again
Now put ya hands, put ya hands, put ya hands, put ya hands up
Get ready 'cause the party is here
If you leave this motherfucker you gon' hardly hear
You don't like the way it's getting, man I'm sorry again
Now put ya hands, put ya hands, put ya hands, put ya hands up

[Verse 2]
I've got outta school, 'cause all my teachers was sick of me
I vandalize to adjust for my publicity
Forget the big rap stars what I get to be
They even do me up on the news, mama look at me
They're all mad at me, askin' me where my sanity
Plannin' these strategy, try to turn my life into tragedy
But it ain't happenin', I'ma let 'em keep babblin'
Don't let me get a deal 'cause I guarantee you'll be mad again
I didn't turn out the way that I ought to be
So fuck school, LAUSD [?]
Whenever something was wrong they blame it all on me
So I'm like fuck work I rather fall asleep
Pardon me. Would you give the school an apology?
Hell nah! You claim you're right man you gotta be
You doing that it's like you try to win the lottery
I do the shit again if ever did niggas bother me

[Hook]
Get ready 'cause the party is here
If you leave this motherfucker you gon' hardly hear
You don't like the way it's getting, man I'm sorry again
Now put ya hands, put ya hands, put ya hands, put ya hands up
Get ready 'cause the party is here
If you leave this motherfucker you gon' hardly hear
You don't like the way it's getting, man I'm sorry again
Now put ya hands, put ya hands, put ya hands, put ya hands up

[Bridge]
We gon' party hard 'til the break of dawn ladies
Drop low brothers wave your arms
You don't like the way it's gettin' then you better go home
When they partyin' a party and Hopsin on the microphone

[Verse 3]
True gat, my cool raps is too fat
Produce tracks, it's too hot and fools act (what)
Like they never really feelin' the flow
But I don't give a fuck, Hopsin is still on the row
Make 'em bounce and clap [?]
The house is packed, some niggas lookin' like they 'bout to strap
But I ain't trippin' though, cool when I spit the flow
'Cause most of these niggas who'll be actin' hard really get a shit
I don't floss 'cause the things is stupid
I'm a MC I don't need [?] to prove it
Hopsin hot shit nigga he's a exclusive
These other MCs is clueless, you know how'd be

[Hook]
Get ready 'cause the party is here
If you leave this motherfucker you gon' hardly hear
You don't like the way it's getting, man I'm sorry again
Now put ya hands, put ya hands, put ya hands, put ya hands up
Get ready 'cause the party is here
If you leave this motherfucker you gon' hardly hear
You don't like the way it's getting, man I'm sorry again
Now put ya hands, put ya hands, put ya hands, put ya hands up
