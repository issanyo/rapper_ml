[Intro: King Chip]
Class of 2005, I’m shitting on all your niggas

[Verse 1: King Chip]
Shittin’ on these niggas at the high school reunion
Bitch I got the check I left it to the credit union
Got a hundred niggas ready but you a bitch, I ain’t gon’ need ‘em
Bitch ask me what King Chip mean, I say Cleveland
Fuck y’ass nigga, try talk crazy, now a nigga walk crazy
I be getting off lately, got it all safety, cause you’re crazy
You think my son ain’t finna had no daddy, you’re crazy
If I bust a nigga head it’s cause y’all made me
You ain’t seen me in a while, got the check, now pray the lord saved me

[Hook: King Chip]
You ain’t seen me in a while
I’m shitting on you now
You ain’t seen me in a while
Shittin’ on these niggas at the high school reunion
You ain’t seen me in a while

You ain’t seen me in a while
Shittin’ on these bitch ass niggas at the high school reunion

[Verse 2: King Chip]
Shittin’ on these niggas at the high school reunion
Bitch, I just came here to stunt, I ain’t want no reunion
Even if pretty Vicky what they call her, King Chip fucking over all of ‘em
I know some bitch never said nothing to me in the hall, now I’m skeeting over all of ‘em
I was in the real wet thing, I was in the pussy [?]
Two bitches from the twelfth grade both start sprayin’
You never seen me grindin’, now I’m finna start playin’
I ain’t got no diploma, ain’t got no student loans
I’m a student to the fuck shit, [?]
I ain’t never go to prom, nigga fuck prom
All these hoes fat and broke, live with their mom

[Hook: King Chip]
You ain’t seen me in a while

Shittin’ on these bitch ass niggas at the high school reunion

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
Shit
You motherfuckers better feel lucky that I showed up
Back then I remember y’all was giving no fucks
Showing no love to a nigga I was so cut
Now you bitches all upon my dick because I blowed up
Girls wouldn’t give my ass to [?]
My self-esteem was [?] inside the grave
Revenge was something I knew, one day that I repay
With my success, now look at my fucking life, hurray
I got a brand new house up in Norwich
‘Bout to get a second one somewhere up in New York bitch
Shit you tryna throw it at me now you better forfeit
You got three broke baby daddies with like four kids
What the hell you fuckin’ with grown niggas who don’t get paid
Oh well, it’s your life, your mistake
Shit is sad to me, you coulda had a king
Do me a favor, go home and cry your ass to sleep

[Hook: King Chip]
You ain’t seen me in a while
I’m shitting on you now
You ain’t seen me in a while
Shittin’ on these niggas at the high school reunion
You ain’t seen me in a while

Shittin’ on these bitch ass niggas at the high school reunion

[Hook: King Chip]
You ain’t seen me in a while

Shittin’ on these niggas at the high school reunion
You ain’t seen me in a while

[Outro: King Chip]
