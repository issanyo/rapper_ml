[Hook x2: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
I ain't the one you wanna stand
My motherfuckin Glock never jam
Da Glock go bam!
To the po po get me if you can
Rollin in a drop top lamb
Da Glock go bam!

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Some say my criminal experience is legendary
I do what's necessary
Niggas wanna see me buried
Worried, if you comin' hurried
I ain't goin' down, fuck the world I'm a thug
Tell 'em can't nothin' stop me but a slug
I went from drug dealin' to a shot caller
From off the block, no longer rock
And puttin' money in my pocket, nationwide baller
Bitch nigga I'm prepared to die, Before I fry
I hit the weed so I be forever high
My eyes has seen so much in misery, So before I flee
I open fire let the lord pick the first to bleed
Bitches don't wanna see me leave, forever thuggin'
Tell 'em bury me a G on everything I love
And fuck the law cause the raw niggas ain't free
This picture's clear but we can't see, hahaha
This game is jealousy, Don't let 'em change
That's what they keep on tellin' me, motherfuck the fame

[Hook x2: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
I ain't the one you wanna stand
My motherfuckin Glock never jam
Da Glock go bam!
To the po po get me if you can
Rollin in a drop top lamb
Da Glock go bam!

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Bounce like a trampoline, thousands that's amped as me
Kids run up on your school campus slap a dean
I grew up on baggy jeans, pornographic nasty dreams
Moral of my damn story life, isn't a happy scene
Wish I was stacking cream, wish I had a Lamborghini
Wish I had the cover on a Rolling Stones magazine
I'm sick of the radio playing all these faggot teens
Keep it real, show me something ill that I haven't seen
For ten years I've been working on ill flows
And finally got a fucking record deal and I'm still broke
Man that's not common, bombs that I'm dropping
Are dope, but all that I can afford is some top Ramen
I notice that ya'll niggas like to dumb the stats
I should stomp your ass out until your lungs collapse
No more corny cowabunga rap, we done with that
It's a rap, keep it up and get your tongue detached
Come on

[Hook x4: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
I ain't the one you wanna stand
My motherfuckin Glock never jam
Da Glock go bam!
To the po po get me if you can
Rollin in a drop top lamb
Da Glock go bam!

[Outro: 2Pac]
BAM!
BAM!
B-B-B-BAM!
The Glock go bam!
Bam!
BAM!
BAM!
B-B-B-BAM!
