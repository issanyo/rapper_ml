Yo, you can define me as [?] with the rhyme schemes
Soon as the time reach I'ma swoop up and find beef
I'm truth of a mind freak, Ruthless revived me
Whatever level you fools at I'm quadruple it times three
Your movement was nicely put together till I got discovered
Thank the god of brothers for giving life to obnoxious suckers
My thoughts are fucked up, corrupted from never being signed
Seven years of spittin' and somehow I never seemed to shine
But now I got my deal, plus I got my pockets filled
I bought a box of skills and beyond me that usually I conceal
But now it's mandatory, pop some white eyes in
So niggas canâ€™t ignore me even though they think this man is corny
Think what you wanna, I'm thankful that I'ma great performer
If you hatin' more then I'm making sure that your face is torn up
So grab your mic and warm up, then feed me more fuel
Then eat your heart out, aw fuck it, I'll eat it for you
