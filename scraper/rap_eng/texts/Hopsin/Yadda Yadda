Lyrics:
Okay, I should of jumped in last year. But hey practice makes passable
I should of buzzed like Lightyear, no bullshit. No matador
I want to make a change, still think I'm derange? hey..
Yay I did it, I'm a rapper Ma' look I'm on my way!
Shut the fuck up with these silly gimmicks
I can seek out phony calls when you rappers spit it
If you think I was gonna spend 8 bucks to talk about myself. Well then you're an idiot
Take a Ticket I'm a kick some ass but not like Jarren Benton did
8 bars left, no help. So don't call. You better top this
Your notes making ears sore, Chris Bosh
You see this kids? Growing up young and reckless
With teen aged depression, and pregnant not to mention. I didn't forget it
I blame all that "bs" on the world, influence is our hypnotism so wake up. I'm an insomniac Progressing with "Flo"
I ain't got no time for no 2 chain raps so "scur scur" scoot you ass back to class. SWAG THAT DOWN YO ASS CRACK!

[Hook: Unlucky DJ]
ALL YOU DO IS BLAH BLAH BLAH (What, What)
BLAH BLAH BLAH (Uh OHH)
TALK TOO MUCH YADDA YADDA YADDA HAHA (oh ohh Ooh OOOH)
HA HA

[Verse 2:]
"MAN I GET MONEY, GUAP. AINT NO STOPPING
BITCHES POP IT. I LIKE TO SHOP BITCH!"
See, that be silly, my machiavelli seeing
Living like missing biggie. P Diddy
World so "Cole", so chilly
Who dat, in the CD/City
Claiming millis', so whoa. This track
This whole Album, something about fucking titties
And claim this is real rap
Nah that's whack, matter of fact
Its lack of talent. Passed that, ridiculous
Pretty sure your not really hearing this!?
Okay, Okay. Lets fuck this with one glove, OJ
Portray, more Weezy for Sheezy, so ill be like more Wayne!
The a sell out phase. REDS UP, no Happy days
Everyday is the fucking SAME. Let me Hit em with a little bit of BANG BANG
Now you See how I go insane, in the brain, like cypress hill
Take a chill pill and skill up. You know what just shut up
Rappers wanna yap, then go ahead. But Ill be damned if that shit gets you bread
Fix your head instead. I vent on lead. And look what has been said
I created it like Eggs
