[Intro: SrirachaTheGod]
Sriracha
I put that on everything
Sriracha
Oh
Kill that shit
You got it!

[Verse 1: SrirachaTheGod]
Im not a rapper im a psycho
Always rushing in hitting hard like a rhino
Sriracha lyrically chewing shit up like a dino
NIGGA YOU RAP TOO FAST! Lol, I know
Scrolling through Instagram looking for a fine hoe
Need me a white girl, not talking albino
Cuz her skin color matching with her fucking spine though
Oh, and also a brown skin like a pine cone (Nigga!)
So i finally hit the DM
Tryna fucking smash but she only said weekend
Lookin' at the calander and it said "Tuesday"
But i need the nut busted i dont care whatchu say trick
I told the lil hoe drop the address (Why?)
So that we can hop on the matress (Oh)
Come to find out she's and actress (Damn)
All talk no action, Am i mad? YES! (Fuck)
And the worse part is sometimes a hoe catches feelings and they wanna go date you but then again if you say no then they'll hate you and try to get you arrested for false accusations
So my on advice is dont mess with a hoe
Because i done been through all of that yo
Like a drug ad, never say yes say no
Im starting to think I NEED HELP BRO!

[Hook: SrirachaTheGod & Hopsin]
The world made me feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!

[Verse 2: SrirachaTheGod]
No, no, no, no, no, no, SHIT!!
The bitch ain't tight she refurbished (blah!)
Now im kinda feeling real nervous (about?)
When i try to slide in the cervix (oh)
Im surprised she still in service (but?)
She the definition what a curve is (yea)
She want me to slide where the fur is (gross)
772 where my turf is (true)
Ain't nobody lookin for no trouble with TheGod like
When I step my foot into the lime light
Everybody lookin' at me like it was the twilight
If a nigga dissin on me then he go night-night
There is no way that i can ever goes lose a fight night especially if it is my fight (NO!)
I cannot afford to embarass myself like that
Snap a fool in half like he was a Kit Katt
Such a pussy ass nigga he will never hit back
This is why i think need help
*Gasp*
I had a vision of breaking into a church and molesting a holy statue by rubbing my dick on the forehead of Virgin Mary no it ain't scary get me burried
Obviously i have no respect or remorse
Do i think I'll go to hell? Well yea of course
I THINK IM LOSING MY MIND (NO!)
I THINK I GOT LOST IN TIME (AH!)
I need some help finding myself
Im so tired of fighting myself
Inner demons winning i can't afford to keep sinning my
Head is still spinning
Maybe its the drugs
Maybe its lack of hugs from these girls
Or maybe its cuz i hang out with them thugs

[Hook: Hopsin]
I feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!

[Verse 3: SrirachaTheGod]
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody
Dont make have to spaz out and catch a body
Your girl ain't loyal nigga shes everyone's shawty
Man, yall niggas tryna kill my vibe
Yall be the reason for why i get high
You stress me out so much i just wanna cry
If you think im lying then look in my EYE!
Friday the 13th, its time to die
Chainsaw massacre, a psycho am I
Im just so bonkers come look in my mind
I swear to god i need help but thats hard to FIND!
Sometimes i feel like no one really be feeling me
(Sometimes i feel like no one really be feeling me)
Get the hell out my face lil boy you ain't no G
(Get the hell out my face lil boy you ain't no G)
Stop tryna act like you been so damn fond of me
(STOP tryna act like you been so damn fond of me)
Only one nigga hates me but he wants my dick
(And thats true i got witnesses bitch)

[Hook: SrirachaTheGod & Hopsin]
The world made me feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!

[Outro: SrirachaTheGod & Hopsin]
