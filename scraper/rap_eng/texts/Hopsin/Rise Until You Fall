[Intro]
So you wanna be a big time rapper huh?
You wanna record deal
Wanna blow the fuck up?
Well good luck

[Verse]
Yo, this rap game is shady
It's trifling what they did to me
Took away my whole fucking life
And then showed no sympathy
They'll trash you in a blink of an eye for another entity
And I always thought that me and this music shit were meant to be
Everyday I sit alone in a dark room mad at my fucking career
Just hoping it starts soon
So I put these white contacts in that I go berzerk wit'
Then wild out on rappers who made it that don't deserve it
I needed cash so I signed over my soul to earn it
I'm writing flows dead as I lay in a hole of curses
They promised fame, I ain't spend five minutes on the surface
My life is supposed to circuit
I'm trying to hold my purpose
I'm writing the dopest verses inspired and so assertive
But I'm broke as fuck
Washing my laundry with no detergent
They said Hopsin your the best MC
The next big thing to blow up from the west indeed
Bullshit!

[Hook](x2)
So if you ain't gonna stick to your word
Then don't lie and tell me you are
Mothafuckas I'mma rise until you fall
Come and see me, I'mma rise until you fall
Bitch I'm not playing no more
