[Interlude]
Man, rap today fucking sucks bad, I don't give a fuck what anybody says
These fools ain't spittin' no type of dope shit, but that's not even the bad part; they're not even saying words anymore
They just got a hard-ass fuckin' beat to trick dumb-asses like you to make you think you like the shit
Play that fuckin' beat!
We got some real fuckin' mentally retarded rappers in the game
I know for a fact nobody know what the fuck these dudes be saying!
Wait, turn my reverb and my auto-tune on real quick
This what the fuck they be doing

[Intro]
Yeah, haha, yeah!
Shawty, let's make money!
Turn up!

[Verse]
I put it Rollie, I'm drinkin' straight lean
A bitch is straight feelin' my diamonds (my diamond)
I roll in the city, my nigga, you got me
The shit, man, that’s hit, on my mama (Brrrrp!)
And give me some ugh! (Bow)
Robbing them, nigga, and fool (I holla)
Embedded the money, I got us some putty, some butter
Hakuna Matata! (Tata! Tata! Tata!) (turn up!)
I am tellin' you niggas
I’ll bury yo' daddy for taking my lotion (I know you)
I been taming your barrel, I say what I said
When I’m saying “my lotion!” (Gimme my lotion!)
I been giving you money, my niggas
And niggas’ll go a lil crazy (Go, Go!)
I went to the doctor, he looked at my dick
And he said I got rabies! (Dang!)

[Pre-Hook]
A lotta niggas tryna figure out
She gonna do a nigga big, I know
I'm on the jury duty's corners standin' big, I know
I'm standin' big, I know
I want it big, I know (I know, I know)

[Hook]
I know, I know
I know, I know, I got it big, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know, I got it big, I know
I got it big, I know
I got it big, I know
I got it big, I know
I know, I know

[Outro]
Now watch these dumbasses be like
"Aye, that shit was hard though, bruh!"
