[Verse 1: DT]
Hi, I am schizo in the making, [?]
Instrumentals coming for the taking, hate me
Because I play with fire while trying to seduce my lady, it's crazy
Pushing her for threesomes and I hope it comes naybe
Lately people been pushing me to the edge
Public is hella nosy so I paint on my room red
She said get fucked and left all mad at me
I guess she wasn't feeling me, playing with her sanity
It just the man in me, niggas don't listen
I'm so sick got anthrax in my blood system
But I guess it's in my blood, she's trying hard not to love
But she's leaving me because

[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung]
She thinks I'm a psycho, might go, mug a motherfucker so
Other motherfuckers know, cut your motherfucking throat
What you motherfuckers know? Tell me what you bitches know
Stitches though, keep looking like a vicious dog
She tells me I'm a psycho, might go, mug a motherfucker so
Other motherfuckers know, cut your motherfucking throat
What you motherfuckers know? Tell me what you bitches know
Stitches though, keep looking like a vicious dog

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Now I'm a fuckin' product to the Lucifer effect
And it's a damn shame what I do to get respect
See I got a girlfriend, but I'm just using her for sex
Until the uterus is wrecked, that's how I do this shittin' yes
I'm H-O-P, don't you forget
The S-I-N after that
Yeah the dude is just possessed, you'd never guessed
What happened to my fuckin' brain?
Yo it's gone Hop, don't you remember that you gave it to the pawn shop? No!
Who the fuck are you? I am, you, you or me?
Yes you! Don't you remember the test tube
That you bled through, when all the fluid you let ooze
From the bottom to the top of it? Do you neglect truth?
Oh that was me huh, I know that
And I known as an aggravated psychopath
My balls are bigger enough to fight your dad
Been to the world twice this year
And I might go back
Depending on how my life go
Should I go and pick up a butcher knife or the bible?
Shit that I be thinking of daily it'll leave your mind blowing
Don't let my wife know
'Cause every time I tryna do something, she tells me I'm a psycho

[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung]
She tells me I'm a psycho, might go, mug a motherfucker so
Other motherfuckers know, cut your motherfucking throat
What you motherfuckers know? Tell me what you bitches know
Stitches though, keep looking like a vicious dog
She tells me I'm a psycho, might go, mug a motherfucker so
Other motherfuckers know, cut your motherfucking throat
What you motherfuckers know? Tell me what you bitches know

Ey yo Hopsin let me tell you what my girl told me

[Verse 3: DT]
She said she had enough of the presence of my insanity
The bitch will sign me up if there was a psycho academy
I'm glad to see that there's other people that just as mad as me
Crucify us 'cause what you doing this shit is blasphemy
Happily ever after, it's just a fairy tale
It's heaven or a tale, I've lost too many cells
The boxes in my mind are hid under a shell
And I'm crossing over lines like an angel that is fell (well)
It started with the flirting that I couldn't miss
Time went by and she realized I was more than a lyrically sick
My bad habit surface that she couldn't get used to it
That's why every time we fuckin', she's tucking in her crucifix
And she was sick of it, a crazy psyho punk
Sicker than a smokers [?] whose influences by the funk
My mind's lost it and she's coming with me if I'm sunk
What time I took her to dinner and threw her ass in the trunk, bitch
Been this way since the itty bitty semen
The way people look at me, makes me wanna see the bleeding
Increasing my anger 'cause before was there was no reason
I've lost it and you treat me like a demon

[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung]
She tells me I'm a psycho, might go, mug a motherfucker so
Other motherfuckers know, cut your motherfucking throat
What you motherfuckers know? Tell me what you bitches know
Stitches though, keep looking like a vicious dog
She tells me I'm a psycho, might go, mug a motherfucker so
Other motherfuckers know, cut your motherfucking throat
What you motherfuckers know? Tell me what you bitches know
Stitches though, keep looking like a vicious dog
