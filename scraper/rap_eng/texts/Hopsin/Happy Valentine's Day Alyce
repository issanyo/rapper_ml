[Verse]
Yo
There's something that everyone needs to know about
There's a special girl her name is Alyce and yes we go out
I can't be with her at the moment cuz I'm doing shows now
So I had to do this shit the only way I know how
You set my heart right again I swear I'm always smilin'
If you ever down I'll hold you up like you were violin
Groupies reaching for my love but no I don't invite em' in
My heart is in your hands and that's the only place I like it in
I do believe you're meant for me
I swear to God this shit's a dream
The saying goes when you find the one you'll know it instantly
Way back in 2010 I've been known
But I was having trouble tryna get up out that friend zone
But it's O-kay cuz every treasure's worth waiting for
I thank the lord that I have you cuz I was filled with so much hate before
Shit I've been cheesing hard every single day on tour
I gotta stop that shit though, for real my face is sore
For real Alyce, it's like you changed me to a new guy
I never felt the urge by a woman so much to do right
We gonna travel the planet through the Bahamas to Dubai
Any preference you like, we're gonna be in the moonlight
Living like death is foreign
Haters we'll just ignore em'
They get salty because we found happiness way before 'em
Baby we hotter than a whistling tea pot
And we don't need no outsiders telling us what we got, peace out
Girl you're so beautiful you're looking like a goddess
But still you always humble and stay modest
You ain't digging in my pockets
You got your own money up inside your wallet
Girl you so fucking bad you need stop it, I just
Feel like I need to fly away with you baby
No other girl can ever take what you gave me
Will you be my Valentine? Baby let me know
We go together perfectly, the Cancer and the Leo, yeah!
I ride for you like a soldier
Baby all you gotta do is give me your love, yeah
The world can get to know us, show love
If you'll be my valentine

[Outro]
Happy Valentine's day Alyce. I hope you like this. Sorry I can't be there, I'm on my tour but, just letting you know that I'm thinking about you, and I want the world to know as well. Peace
