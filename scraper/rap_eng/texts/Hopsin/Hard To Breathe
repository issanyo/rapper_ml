[Intro: Connor Jones]
Ayo What it is? It's Connor Jones, baby
Braidz, Loose Logic, Hopsin on the beat
Let's Go!
Yeah, B-raidz


[Verse: Braidz]
I'm that nearly invisible guy who is clear in design
Got these dogs Sniffing For Lines but I'm Spliffin' to rhymes
I'm Dope Brother, none 'ya crew got Criminal Minds
So don't make me call the homies there's a Crim In All Mine
We wouldn't pass the drug tests but our physical's fine
Kiss 'em goodnight this is Australia the original Criminal Mine
Hop sent me this beat told me "Kill it with the illest of guys"
I thought Siege would be tight then got Loose Logic - like an idiot type
Spirited I'm looking straight through the Pyramid's Eye
You can call me "Space Shuttle" - It's my mission to fly
To be the dude creating super saying's - Like Krillin just died
And make 'em see the point like a pin to the eye
Nickles & Dimes I Change up the style
Braidz' like your girl - Ain't came in a while
Funny, I went on a break for some time
Though smoko' is over the flames have arrived!
Now they're saying "Jesus Christ, he is nice"
I swear between my Feet & Thighs that I Need this life
That's why I'm Still Movin' - Shoutouts to Dizzy Wright
Liam's Tighter than a Virgin's Chastity Belt With No Key Designed
I know I talk alot but when I say I'm Peaking, right?
This is the Umph That I Mean - Like Speed & Ice


[Hook: Connor Jones]
When life be holding us down and we're trapped under water
If only we'd drown we'd be free of dis-order
All the while we are lead to believe
That we are all free
(?) so hard to breathe


[Verse: Loose Logic]
Who wanna try me? Testing the god thinkin' you won't die
You got a better chance getting a clean win in a bum fight
Spar with a Spartan ain't smart and keep up with the flow, try
And have you breathing hard like a hooker getting her throat piped
The main archer that’s gotcha' targeted then off ya'
And i'll run away with the body just like a grave robber
Cause I don’t want nothing but winnin' at minimum hittin' em up an I'm grinning
My venomous ways are intended to send 'em to heaven or whatever the fuck you believe in
Go against the grain and I could get 'cha, off of this good liquor
Yeah… Go 'head and branch out in a wood chipper
But when I waste you, you are not gon' rebuild
Cause when I buckle down you just another notch on my belt
Yeah there's people I could diss but im feeling like its all for not
Cause Ya'll just a waste of time - like a pocket watch
Got Braidz on the track, and ain't nobody murkin' that
So it's all on - Like where Hairstylists' workin' at
The three of us on a track I'm thinking you got shook
When I throw my weight around - Like an Olympian shot-put'
You living it cautious while you hoping I stay chill
But the lines never stop - Like pouring coke on a treadmill


[Hook: Connor Jones]
When life be holding us down and we're trapped under water
If only we'd drown we'd be free of dis-order
All the while we are lead to believe
That we are all free
(?) so hard to breathe
