[Intro]
Ohhh right
Its been two years since I've been up in this bitch, son
Yo

[Verse 1]
What up niggas I'm back in London
Hungry as hell if your ass was wondering
I've been hibernated up inside a dragon's dungeon
Bitch I promise I'm the wrong jackass to fuck with
I'm mad destructive, past deductive
Master of this rap shit you been trying to perfect
Nigga I spazzed but I never had a sign of tourettes
When I finish bodying this yo who trying to get next?
No I ain't done, wait, the game done changed
You niggas 'bout to feel the wrath of Shang Tsun's rage
Imma bring some pain
Fuck your boo-hoos I'm coo-coo
I shoot through you bitch
I'm repping eight, one eight should've been new
Been packing venues, before Mickey D's put a fucking snack wrap on the menu
Before the swag shit where snapbacks were an issue
Before that nigga beat Christy Mack with jiujitsu
A menace, it's true, I'm killing you fools
Take a nap while your dead body is still in the room
Strictly independent with my millions of views
I be living it how you be pretending you do
Timothy, what these niggas be saying with my back turnt
I bet its a whole lot of bad words
But they smile when they see me
Avoiding a confrontation cause they know I'll be rolling out the black hearse
They don't want no problem with the grim reap
They been weeping, minced meet up against me
So bitch please, I dug a grave hole ten feet
I murder whoever achoos [I CHOOSE] like I just sneezed
Yo new shit, I wouldn't want to bang that
I'm a fraud, yo, you wouldn't want to say that
If you exclude me then who is gonna save rap
Niggas know I put the pussy on the chain wax
Bow down when you come around this
I'm the motherfucking king with the underground hits
I don't care what you other niggas coming out with
I'm worldwide now I don't give a fuck about shit
All bitch niggas do is talk these days
Blah blah blah blah, oh, he's fake
I'm doing the world tour when it's all prepaid
Living life, vacation out in Aussie, mate
And it all seems great, doesn't it
My life be bubbling I'm loving it
All you suckers mean mugging me, you can suck a dick
Now that I'm buzzing
These motherfucking, bloodsucking, hustling labels want to be down
Y'all should've discovered it
Fuck you, sip a cup of cum juice like its fun to
I'm not the one you should run to
Hit a nigga with the 1-2, there is no strings attached, they have all been cut loose
There's no undo, no Command-Z, life's dandy
Boy, put fear in you like Scoob and Shaggy, zoinks
Dissing me oh that's a nasty, choice
Y'all niggas gonna get my raspy, voice
I spazz like a crack fiend on caffeine trying to doze off waking up from a bad dream
If you attack me then its gonna be a sad scene
Its Funk Volume, nigga you know what that means
You in the backseat, filling you up with gasoline
Do you even have a fucking clue what the match brings?
Me and my niggas say we too stupid to have brains
We pull our pants down and take a poop on the rap game
We nasty, but we got a lot of, cake
Squad looking like we about to rob a bank
Dark ass nigga like Shabba, Ranks
Haters always making me hotter, thanks
It's two-thousand and fourteen, we stacking up more cream
Taking your face, wiping the floor clean
Nigga you gonna need a bigger dosage of morphine
You can't ignore me because I'm the demon in your dreams

[Outro]
Nigga
Nigga I'm the demon in your dreams
Nigga, yeah
Nigga I'm the demon in your dreams
Alright, I'm done
