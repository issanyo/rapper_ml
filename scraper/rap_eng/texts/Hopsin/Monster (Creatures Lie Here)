Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the window
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the window
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the window
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the window

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Tech's in the place, everybody gettin' mainy
Punks better cuff your lady, can't nobody tame me
Blame me, for keepin' her runny eyed rainy
Ladies used to hate me, now they comin' out their panties
Girls on the jock (check), pocket full of socks (check)
Got a fat knot (check), somethin' going squat (yeah)
Down, dopa-dopa-do, down for the block? (yes)
Tryin' to be hot, but you flop
Wanna be shot to the top but you not dwamn!
I ain't never seen so much green
Than when I seen when my team hit the scene
It must be a dream
Hit the stage, everybody holler
Gettin' throwed, rippin' shows for a bigger dollar
Father, I don't wanna leave nobody toothless
'Cause they greedy in the middle of what I do best
You finna see me in the TV with a few guest
We 'bout to bubble, baby, get your waterproof vest

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
I'm the rap maniac with the hooligan eyes
Who's cooler than I? Wack niggas, move it aside
When you heard I was a big deal you were surprised
West coast, bitch, put ya w's in the sky
I spent my days as a refugee
'Til the rap game came to rescue me
And left my wrist paved in accessories
A dangerous necessity, I came here to wreck MCs
You're wrong if you thinkin' Wayne was the recipe
Nah, he ain't worthy of that, the controversy is back
Get off the kool aid, stir me a batch
See, I prefer to relax, but I can't and God knows it
Gotta stay raw with the flow that I'm diagnosed with
Oh shit, niggas, keep fuckin' with my emotions
Maybe that's the reason I suffer from psychosis
Shocking as high voltage, fuck it, my life's hopeless
So I had to make sure I killed it when I wrote this
