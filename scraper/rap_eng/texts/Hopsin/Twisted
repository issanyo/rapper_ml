[Intro: Einstagator]
(Taps mic)
Is this thing on?
Settle down, settle down
So we've invited all of you guys here because you think you're about to make the transition from underground to mainstream
You think that shit finna happen overnight, right?
Haha
But we're here to give y'all a little helping hand
Hopsin, let's get 'em

[Verse 1: Einstagator]
(Pay attention) all you rappers better listen
Think you're about to run hip-hop, you've got it twisted
First of all, figure out why you do this
Do you spit for love, or you trying to get a few cents (which one?)
And every artist that you meet gon' give his two cents
It's bullshit, 50 percent of that is just useless
Matter of fact, if I was you I wouldn't use this
'Cause shit I did probably won't even help me in music
I wish I could say that lyrics matter but they really don't
All these labels gonna care about you but they really won't
So if you gon' have any hope
You better learn the business or I swear your rappin' ass really really broke
Don't be afraid to invest in yourself
And always stick to the goals that you set for yourself
This shit ain't easy as it look, read a book
You ain't thinking 'bout a damn word I'm saying, I can see it in your look

[Hook: Hopsin]
So let me guess, you think you know it all
Think you 'bout to blow the fuck up then ball, no
Nigga it may takes years before you do finally get your money right (get your money right)
Let me guess, you think you got the balls
And your flow is so fly nigga you can never fall off
Then you've got it twisted if you think that you gon' run this industry

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
I just want to say it first and all
This industry has certain flaws, up in labels every person stalls
Your demo ain't the only work involved
And if you do get a deal you get put on hold and never learn the cause
They'll tell you that your music's so amazing
And then the next day they'll take a fucking vacation on no occasion
Two years and it's got you so impatient
No motivation to making music 'cause everything was overrated
They love the fact that you don't know the basics
So if they tell you that you're gonna be touring with Shady then don't embrace it
It's a relationship that's off and on
And you went Hollywood on most of friends so now you all alone
Ain't got a car so shit you're walking home
After all of your meetings, bleeding, hoping they give a dog a bone
Now everything's a damn tragedy
'Cause you didn't understand the business to prevent it from being
Fantastic

[Hook: Hopsin]
So let me guess, you think you know it all
Think you 'bout to blow the fuck up then ball, no
Nigga it may takes years before you do finally get your money right (get your money right)
Let me guess, you think you got the balls
And your flow is so fly nigga you can never fall off
Then you've got it twisted if you think that you gon' run this industry

[Verse 3: Einstagator & Hopsin]
Ay yo Hop, it's time to put me down with Funk Volume
We just did a song, I know it shouldn't be a problem
Dawg, where'd you get that thought from?
Let me guess, you're thinking that our moving is so awesome
Right?
Right, the website, the contents, the videos
You act like you ain't getting dough, but now it's time to split it though
Wait! Getting dough? You think that you would have cake
On FV? We ain't doing that great
Our whole situation's a confusing ass maze
Ever since the music bis' had a stupid ass change
I'm trying to get with your shit, I heard it was the dopest
You can't be talking about focus? Yeah nigga no shit
No it's not, Hop, I ain't where I need to be
You the one on Ruthless, you could sign me Eazy-E
I mean easy, man shut up and can it
I know you making bank, you sold a fucking song to Atlantic

[Hook: Hopsin]
So let me guess, you think you know it all
Think you 'bout to blow the fuck up then ball, no
Nigga it may takes years before you do finally get your money right (get your money right)
Let me guess, you think you got the balls
And your flow is so fly nigga you can never fall off
Then you've got it twisted if you think that you gon' run this industry
