[Verse 1: Hopsin]
Yo, My family never had cheese
The pain ate us
My mom would always say not to hang with the gangbangers
So most of my life I would chill with the same skaters
Bustin' up curbs till cops would vacate us
And every other day I wore the same old shirt
Had a lot of roaches but the Raid won’t work
The girls I try to holla at, they don’t flirt
Cause in Hollywood they wanna see your payroll first
Check it
But I don’t even got a dime for you niggas
I don’t make residuals off of the rhymes I done spit
A lot of little niggas clownin cause time I done spent
Tryna buzz, you life’s great but mine is a bitch
It’s times like this that I regret dropping out
But on the mic I got a bite like a crocodile
Let me see your tig bitties girl pop 'em out
Hopsin, I’m the nigga niggas talk about

[Hook 1: Hopsin]
I can’t even grow in a mustache
And plus I’m picking girls up with a bus pass
What’s my name?
(Hop Hop Hop Hop)
Uh huh, uh huh
(Hop Hop Hop Hop)
What’s my name?
(Hop Hop Hop Hop)
Uh huh, uh huh
(Hop Hop Hop Hop)

[Verse 2: Nay Nay]
Yeah, yeah
For years I tried to make a name for myself
I wrote songs, dropped bombs, No one came to my help
Been on my independent grind, no one there when I fell
So when I make it to the top, have no one there as well
I’ll be laughin’ at you fools on the way to the bank
While you’re stuck countin’ pennies tryna fill up your tank
You’re really not hot dog, I’m being perfectly frank
So you can suck my two grapes, I don’t care what you think
Dang, I’m an animal
Channel my inner Hannibal
Cannibalistic flow and you know that I got stamina
God dammit, got bars that they can’t handle cuh
I understand it bruh, they’re too flammable
I’m steady with the sauce, got the juice in the booth
Bend it over for me, show me what that booty do
Try to keep my circle tighter than a fruity loop
It’s Nay Nay, I spit it true to get it through to you

[Hook 2: Nay Nay]
I try to make it but have no luck
So I still drive around inside my dad's truck
What's my name?
(Nay Nay Nay Nay)
Uh huh, uh huh
(Nay Nay Nay Nay)
What's my name?
(Nay Nay Nay Nay)
Uh huh, uh huh
(Nay Nay Nay Nay)
