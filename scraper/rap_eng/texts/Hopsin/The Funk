[Hook: Dove] x2
I love funk
The type of ish
That makes a punk scared
Hope you can smell me in the air
Everywhere I go
They all know
We gotta let the whole globe know
It's that funk

[Verse 1: D. LYNCH]
Taking shots like Ferguson cops
A murderous plot will get you burned on the spot
You young learners forgot
Leave you to suffer and rot
You can suck my dick
Fuck around and get shot
Ashes to ashes lets smoke some dust
A little ego booster if your homies get tough
A handful of cash it ain't never enough
Come walk my way bitch you will get snuffed

[Hook: Dove] x2

[Verse 2: D. LYNCH]
Going to hell yo
Shit, it's been a long day
5k to whoever brings me Kanye
Kill him and Kim, rubbing me the wrong way
Shoot up Jay and fuck the shit out of Beyonc√©
I hear you like it like that you little midget bitch
We ever meeting and I'm breaking all your fucking ribs
Did I say it out loud?
What I mean is...
I said what I mean, cunt, lick my flaccid penis
I came here tonight
To get on your nerves, to ruin your snotty ass kids
Who cling to every word 'til your getting calls about how your son is disturbed
He's suspended from school
For flipping his teacher the bird
You don't do shit 'til we tell you to
You failed everyone and you failed us too
Fucking around was your fatal move
Quit moving around before we kill you fool

[Hook: Dove] x2

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
Hip-hop's supposed to come from a place of intelligence
What the FBI, CIA, or secret god damn service?
I'm speaking on behalf of them silver spoon fed
Feds who are fed up with Doves like me at the foundation of music
So they poke, bite, hate, and black mail
Throw anything revolutionary or positive in jail
It ain't just black males either
It's anyone with the audacity to hold a crowd and be an influential speaker
Fuck'em
Turn up a 50 thousand watt PA
Hang it over DC, put a track on replay
Chuck D, Flava Flav, Bust a bust, NAS
KRS, Bahamadia, 2Pac, God
They all try to relate to us through the spiritual messages
Make sure the beat slaps so nobody forgets it
Adversaries regret it, enemies check your check list
The type of funk so strong a skunk respects it
