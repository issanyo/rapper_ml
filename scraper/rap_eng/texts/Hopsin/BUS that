[Intro]
I'm on the road right now
Back of the tour bus, chillin' (Kato on the track bih)
Just wanted to drop some shit
You know

[Verse 1]
Okay, a wise man told me
That niggas that you beef with will pro'ly be your best pals
(Is that right?) Got my ear to the streets
And I notice everybody dropping shit, I feel left out
(Is that right?) If you in it for the cheese
This is real trap music, yeah, you go be a dead mouse
(Is that right?) You on a oneway street
Either collide or turn it around, that'd be your best route
Listen, y'all need to stop with the dissing
No one pays attention, so quit with the chitchat
Listen, y'all niggas steadily fishing
You riding me hard and my girl want my dick back
Listen, these niggas play like it's cool
And then run their mouth soon as I'm leaving, why is that?
Listen, I've been touring off an album
I ain't even dropped, you pro'ly think I rigged that (Nice)
I'm the plate, nigga, you just the dish rack
The whole Ill Mind series, I done did that
Niggas double taking, getting whiplash
How you tryna school me when I skip class
Confrontation with you is just quick cash
What the fuck you gon' do when your ship crash?
I got the juice, don't get caught in the splish splash
We don't fit in together, we mismatched
I am the misfit that nobody likes
I am colder than ice, I will hold up your life
You bigging you up, you were so overhyped
You were no good with mics, you'll be gone overnight
I saw my window and I dove on it right
Plus the flow is precise, I'm just rolling the dice
You claim that you got the shit on lock
Thinking you safe, but homie, I done broken it twice
Alright

[Chorus]
All around the fucking planet
Niggas on my shit, dog
West side, east side, north side, south side
Bitches on my dick, dog
Snatch yo' freak, I'm that nigga
Cash on fleek, I'm that nigga
Past O.D., I'm that nigga
As for me, I'm that nigga
All around the fucking planet
Niggas on my shit, dog
West side, east side, north side, south side
Bitches on my dick, dog
Snatch yo' freak, I'm that nigga
Cash on fleek, I'm that nigga
Past O.D., I'm that nigga
As for me, I'm that nigga

[Verse 2]
Look, got a brand new chick
She a law student working real hard out in Cape Town
(Cape Town, Cape Town) I became ill
When I hit the beat raw, it was ass up, facedown
(Facedown, facedown) Homie, you ain't shit
You tryna shine, I'ma turn your sunlight into a gray cloud
(Rain, rain) Had to hit you with a new flow
Saying that I sound like Slim Shady during 8 Mile
You signed your life away to record labels
While I'm signing big ol' voluptuous titties
I run through the city, the ladies are comfortable with me
They're wet and I want to go swimming
A wonderful feeling (Woo)
I strike that pussy like a thunderbolt hitting (Woo, woo)
Ladies say "Oh my God, papi
It's all in my hair now, your cum is so sticky" (Yikes)
Am I a sellout or prodigy?
Word on the street is the question is suss
(Suss) Niggas threw dirt on my name
It's ironic that they just got left in the dust
(The dust) You got your head in the clouds?
I am convinced that your head is just stuck
Hmm, don't make me go through my files
And pull all of your dirty evidence up (Oh no)
Niggas it's been on, my pen strong
If one shot fires I'm Kim Jong, so bitch, run
I sent bombs like ISIS from Islam
You drenched on with a light mist of piss, son
Who you know could get it like this? There is none
Rip your limbs, gone from a sick collision
See my nuts hang low, you can't miss the big ones
I'm coming, nigga, here, tell your chick to sip some

[Chorus]
All around the fucking planet
Niggas on my shit, dog
West side, east side, north side, south side
Bitches on my dick, dog
Snatch yo' freak, I'm that nigga
Cash on fleek, I'm that nigga
Past O.D., I'm that nigga
As for me, I'm that nigga
All around the fucking planet
Niggas on my shit, dog
West side, east side, north side, south side
Bitches on my dick, dog
Snatch yo' freak, I'm that nigga
Cash on fleek, I'm that nigga
Past O.D., I'm that nigga
As for me, I'm that nigga
