[Intro]
Yo
Hopsin
Waduuup
Finally back in the fucking studio, man
After the album
Toured the fucking world 'n shit
Let's get it in

[Verse 1: Hopsin]
When I was skateboarding and duckin' classes
Back when I had sucked at rappin'
Never would've once imagine
I would tour the fucking planet
This was faded, was imagine
Can't see it grew up and blasted
Went from being a dungeon dragon to spitting these flames to touch the masses
Niggas be thinking I chose this shit
But God's the reason I rose in this
I'm divin' up into this game full throttle while y'all niggas' thinkin' you've chosen it
You're focused on nothin' but clothes and whips
Tryna stack up lots of dope and chicks
Now you got a little following from being ignorant because you know it's bliss
Hopefully niggas can cope with this
Without thinking this inappropriate
I'm taking over get over it
That's something that haters just won't admit
Go in they heart like a soldier bitch
See it's a cold ass world I'ma close the fence
If I recall I was the only mothafucka who never got love
Now the world seems so convinced
When  I do my thang
Shit done changed
That'll make my lane
And integrate my pain
Into hip-hop
Now what you think whenever you say my name
You see the madness has just begun
So make a path nigga let me run
See I started off slow never got the clip loaded and I'm 'bout to blast y'all like a deadly gun

[Chorus]
This was faded, was imagine
Shit done changed
From a negative to a positive
You can't see it grew up and blasted
This was faded, was imagine
Shit done changed
From a negative to a positive
You can't see it grew up and

[Verse 2: Fortay]
When I was [?] [?] skippin' school
A bull of a kid, thinkin' it's cool
[?]
Never the one [?]
Grew from a place guess it was fake
Drunk is a new a saurus away
Sellin' a soul 'bout 12 years old
Would show you the whole but caught me a case
Was it the music maybe it was
Lot's of confuse praying to God
Option to choose what should I do
Get on at abuse or make me at war
Fuck it I'm here and I'm stuck on the gear
I up in a tier I speak from my heart
Rippin' apart the [?] cunts
So I hit in the park if I hit up the charts
Stay all my shit still clocking it
Never can rest this opposite
From sickening close to let it grip skull
And getting them dough from what I spit
The accomplishments I watch to flip
From a negative to a positive
From mobsters skip they rapid
Jumping on tracks but this time Hop in it
Who done what I did in the place where I'm from
I was just a young kid get a waste of a bong
Structured my shit give up if I quit
I'd be fucked [?] not making a song
Thinking how the fuck did I reach for the urn
Probably ground up like a seed in the dirt
Changed to a loan from the streets and the [?]
With the words that I speak 'til I'm leaving the earth

[Chorus]
This was faded, was imagine
Shit done changed
From a negative to a positive
You can't see it grew up and blasted
This was faded, was imagine
Shit done changed
From a negative to a positive
You can't see it grew up and
