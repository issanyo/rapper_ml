[Intro: Hopsin]
Yeah Ruthless, Bankrupt Records

[Hook]
If we catch you on the block, and you setting up shot
We gon' hit your spot, we gon' hit your spot
If you wanna act tough, but you really ain't buff
We gon' fuck you up, we gon' fuck you up
If we catch you up close, and you try to pour a toast
We gon' slit your throat, we gon' slit your throat
If you wanna be hype, but you know you ain't right
We gon' take your life, we gon' take your life

[Verse 1: Hopsin]
Yo
Since I was young I been living like a foolish guy
Do I wanna go to college or drop out? It's too hard to decide
This life is do or die, and if you ain't wit' it commit suicide
That's the only fuckin' way you get by
I never force this, I keep the torch lit
Of course there's something wicked, it's horror-core shit
I'ma change the game and morph it, then orbit
Around these whack industry niggas, I take their flow and deport it
Fuck your career, man the money you made is not important
Call your label up and tell 'em your project's abortin'
I'm more than deadlier than that shit that hit New Orleans
I play you just like I got played with my ex-girlfriend Morgon
I keep it live from California all the way to Oregon
I got some fans in Germany too, but a small proportion
And I ain't gotta buy no more clothes, I got endorsements
If I ain't here to parent this game, then it's just an orphan

[Hook]
If we catch you on the block, and you setting up shot
We gon' hit your spot, we gon' hit your spot
If you wanna act tough, but you really ain't buff
We gon' fuck you up, we gon' fuck you up
If we catch you up close, and you try to pour a toast
We gon' slit your throat, we gon' slit your throat
If you wanna be hype, but you know you ain't right
We gon' take your life, we gon' take your life

[Verse 2]
Dammy departed, the hell started, the black-hearted
Martian from another planet, that's uncharted
A martyr for hip hop that's a little harder
I put you in the zip-lock bag with your daughter
She's melting so dig it and get you a second helpin'
Pour the stew and let this brain's blue like Selsun
This beast's a monster, so I turn to Van Helsing
Decapitate his dogs, 'cause they wouldn't stop yelping
Just hit 'em with a little spit, the bowl it hits
Skin rips from the ligament
The bone splits, blood drips, I don't give a shit
That's what you get when you fuck with this killa clique
We diligent
Ain't no red lunatics and we ready to fight
Break them bone-saws out, 'cause we're ready tonight
Ain't no tellin' 'em what the fuck be going on in this brain
I never claimed to be gangsta, I claim to be a saint

[Hook]
If we catch you on the block, and you setting up shot
We gon' hit your spot, we gon' hit your spot
If you wanna act tough, but you really ain't buff
We gon' fuck you up, we gon' fuck you up
If we catch you up close, and you try to pour a toast
We gon' slit your throat, we gon' slit your throat
If you wanna be hype, but you know you ain't right
We gon' take your life, we gon' take your life

[Verse 3]
We put it down for them sick ass motherfuckers
We hold it down for them crazy ass motherfuckers
Nothing around with them shady ass motherfuckers
Probably on drugs fuckin' with them motherfuckers
We on that hard shit, get your expect tall
Sick shit, sick sick sick sick shit
You ain't fuckin' with the son of a bitch
Ruthless and Bankrupt they fuckin' with this shit
Better tell 'em boys step the fuck back
Funny automatic make 'em get the fuck back
Fifty round drum if they wanna bust back
Slit they god damn throats, how they gon' duck that
We tired of playing wit 'em, sick of waiting on 'em
They ain't fuckin' wit us, but we coming for them
Stay the gunnin' for them, got somethin' for them
TEC ll do it motherfucker, y'all been warned

[Hook]
If we catch you on the block, and you setting up shot
We gon' hit your spot, we gon' hit your spot
If you wanna act tough, but you really ain't buff
We gon' fuck you up, we gon' fuck you up
If we catch you up close, and you try to pour a toast
We gon' slit your throat, we gon' slit your throat
If you wanna be hype, but you know you ain't right
We gon' take your life, we gon' take your life
