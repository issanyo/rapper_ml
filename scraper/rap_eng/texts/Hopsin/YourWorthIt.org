[Intro: Dax]
Ayee if no ones told you this today, I'ma tell ya!
You worth it!
It’s Dax
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Dax]
You worth it, perfect, see through the surface
A king or a queen be supreme is your purpose I'm certain!
Huh, a don will be formed if you working, the pain is a burden
I’m preaching a service
Let me bring you back
And they gon' tell you this, and they gon' tell you that
That you need to be rich, and you need to be black, huh
Better play a sport and if you can’t you better rap
But baby that’s trash, fuck Social media
Fuck a blue check and a page on Wikipedia
I been disappointed 'cause society been teaching ya
To idolize these people, fuck 'em they ain't even feeding ya
Man what about the janitors? What about the doctors?
Single moms working 2 jobs for they daughters?
What about the garbage men and niggas on the bus?
They be fueling our society, but they ain't paid enough
Man I’m fucking fed up with this shit, so I had to come and speak Took a dark ass topic, put it on a happy beat
I know it's different not the average way you probably wanna listen
That's the reason why it's gonna make a difference, huh

[Chorus: Dax]
You worth it, worth it (so worth it)
So ya perfect, perfect, yeah (so perfect)
You worth it, worth it (so worth it)
So damn perfect, perfect, yeah (so perfect)

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Yo, sometimes we don’t need the school system to help us (that right)
And we don’t need to follow the rules like everyone else does (what)
They boxing us in, we should be aiming to breakthrough (yeah)
Be yourself, let your imagination create you
Don’t ever feel constricted, and don’t ever conform
They’ll step, or get charmed, disable it and sever your arm
I'm writing heaven this palm, and I’m asking for more angels (please)
To be my guardian so the savages won’t break through (right)
Don’t be scared of taking a leap, it’s okay to (yup)
They always gon' doubt when you’re doing shit that they can’t do (for real)
They ain't gonna understand all the shit that you been through (nope)
Open up your eyes and see all potential that’s in you (come on)
You can be a lot more than what you’ve been (yeah)
Step up out of your comfort zone, and make some more new friends
And you may need to cut them off, because they’re loose ends (true shit)
Don’t ever be all talk, just prove it, go do shit

[Chorus: Dax]
You worth it, worth it
So ya perfect, perfect, yeah
You worth it, worth it
So damn perfect, perfect, yeah
You worth it, worth it (so worth it)
So ya perfect, perfect, yeah (so perfect)
You worth it, worth it (so worth it)
So damn perfect, perfect, yeah (so perfect)

[Verse 3: Dax & Hopsin]
Let's make it happen, everybody take my hand
Black, white, gay, bi, boy, girl, every man
Put the hatred to side, yeah it’s time to take a stand
What you worth is what you give, not what you got in terms of bands
Look! We gon' say fuck 'em if they don’t understand
Just let your middle finger linger as you holding ya hands
Some see they hoping to brand, just to keep us in their control
Follow your heart and do what’s in your soul
Just know that you worth it

[Dax]
So worth it, yeah
So perfect
So worth it, yeah
So perfect

[Chorus: Dax]
You worth it, worth it
So ya perfect, perfect, yeah
You worth it, worth it
So damn perfect, perfect, yeah
You worth it, worth it (so worth it)
So ya perfect, perfect, yeah (so perfect)
You worth it, worth it (so worth it)
So damn perfect, perfect, yeah (so perfect)

[Outro: Dax]
And don’t you ever forget it!
And if they tell you otherwise, you know what you tell them?
You say "fuck you"
Haha, it's Dax
