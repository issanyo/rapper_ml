[Verse 1 : Jarren Benton]
Yo, I smother you with a feathered pillow
I bite the barrel of a .38 til' I break teeth and sever the pistol
Crazy isn't the issue, I'm simply fucking deranged
Cut off half of your face and I let the rest of it hang
Niggas taking shots, you better adjust your aim
See I've been through some shit, I've just adjusted to pain
Maniac in a mink coat
I spit fire then I slam him off the rope like Ricky " The Dragon " Steamboat
I breathe life on this mic dude
I beat em' with the same cross the Jews nailed Christ to
It's obvious that I don't like you
I'll meet you after school at 2 o' clock to fight you
Cut my arm off and jerk off with my right foot
Smoke crack stay up all night and I write books
I'm tryna face fuck Ke$ha
You niggas got beef I'll bring the lettuce and ketchup
Alright Tim I fess up
I'm really not a human I'm eatin' you from the neck up
All that fuckin' hatin' you doing it don't affect us
You wake up with a grudge like MOM FUCK BREAKFAST!
Fuck you, her, him, and them
You feminine you gave a rimjob to Tim and Jim
You and the word fag is a synonym
Jarren signing out the nigga version of Eminem

[Verse 2 : Hopsin]
It's pretty clear that I'm a bit different
I lost my mind in 09' and I still don't know what I did with it
Now I punch babies and kick midgets
I'll bust a glass bottle over your head after I piss in it
The game never showed no sympathy for Marcus
Fuck it I got a new remedy to start shit
Every wack rapper's now an enemy, a target
I'm gifted you flat out mentally retarded
Bitch I don't reason with fags, I'll uppercut you so hard the front row of all you teeth will collapse
Your jaw bone will get too weak and detach, I'll put you in a coma so long it'll take you 8 weeks to get back
I'm rockin' out on Tim West and I'm representing with my crew
I'm wack? Take a second listen to my tunes
You niggas better quit I advise you
You never go in like a non-erected dick in a dry cooch

[Verse 3 : Dizzy Wright]
Rappers get nervous when they see me in the picture
They know the consequences of me becoming that nigga
Funk Volume representa leaving niggas in a maze,
You can't get to Hop if I'm playing security at the gate
Uh, It's crazy cuz' I'm in and out The Veg
I see a lack of preparation, but I ain't giving out no breaks
I'm giving out these hands, so I'm letting you know in advance
If you try to step to the plate I'll let my lyrics break your face
I, went from Soul Searchin' to Smoke Out, now I'm overseas and these shows are still sold out
You should be ashamed if you thinkin' I'm bout' to hold out, I'm just coming from the city where I had to kick the do' down
Uh, a flat-top til' my hair is long, Try to clown and I'mma have to hang you with this herringbone
The south fuck with us cuz nigga we put Jarren on, Carry on, We just tryna get our money very long
Ya, and it's working quite nicely, get your wifey, too much time she might like me
The new version of DJ Quik in the 90's, my rhythmalism got these wack niggas tryna find me
It's crazy I went from nothing to something, said I was going global now I'm rapping out in London
I'm coming, I've been a savage heading for your demographic, fuck a punchline I make instant classics nigga
