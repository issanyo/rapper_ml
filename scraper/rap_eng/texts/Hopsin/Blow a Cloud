[Verse 1]
Now I'ma do something a little different
You want swag? Well, here it is, stop trippin'
I gotta keep it real, non-fiction
I'm here to get loose, let the goose start drippin'
It's about to go the opposite of up
While you get it Yung Joc, it's about to go down
I want to see you back it up like reverse
Clock in, go to work, clock out and hit the ground
Maybe I'm a fool like Dame
I throw you dick like a pitch no baseball
I sound rude but you know I don't really mean it
I'm a nice guy, cavalier, [?]
Now get your shovel on if you dig me
Take a couple shots, spin around, get dizzy
Put your camera on flash like titties
Take a picture now, cause we're 'bout to get busy

[Hook: SwizZz]
I'ma let the dog go, I'ma let the cat loose, We about to get wild
I'ma show you how to rock it right here, make it crack with a brand new sound

Blow a cloud and toss it back like yeah
Blow a cloud and toss it back like yeah
Blow a cloud and toss it back like yeah
Blow a cloud and toss it back like yeah

[Verse 2]
Blackberry, black hat, black tee
Black beanie, black rag, black jeans
Black Dunks so yes, I'm mean
I'm ballin' on a budget but fuck, I'm clean
My swag's on a hundred, billion
Thousand, million, damn I lost count
Somebody hit the lights right now
It's about to get wild, I'ma turn this bitch out
Maybe I'ma rock it like Rick
Rock it like cowboy, rocket like ship
Fuck around and get thrown like a fit
Don't got a lot of cream, but your girl's still whipped
My name's just a little too sharp
I get her naked like juice, then beat it like a heart
(Beat it like a what?) beat it like a heart
When the sun rise to the sun set like park

[Hook: SwizZz]
I'ma let the dog go, I'ma let the cat loose, We about to get wild
I'ma show you how to rock it right here, make it crack with a brand new sound

Blow a cloud and toss it back like yeah
Blow a cloud and toss it back like yeah
Blow a cloud and toss it back like yeah
Blow a cloud and toss it back like yeah

[Verse 3]
It's 3 o'clock, but you know we don't stop
I won't sleep, but I'll take a double shot
There you go, grim hop to the top
This might put me over but fuck it I'ma rock
I got a "get it" mentality
You say you do this all the time, let's see if you can handle it
Now put your hand on my trigger
I can shift back then shoot and clean it up like a swiffer
See I'm a rider like flow
And I rolls like royce, nigga tell me what it do
See I'm a captain on the track like Mo'
Dippin' in slow mo', pretty lady get a clue
I know I'm a little off the wall
But I'm flyer than a zipper don't let your pants fall
I'm headed to the house so you know just where to meet me at
SwizZzle it's official I'm a natural aphrodisiac

[Hook: SwizZz]
I'ma let the dog go, I'ma let the cat loose, We about to get wild
I'ma show you how to rock it right here, make it crack with a brand new sound

Blow a cloud and toss it back like yeah
Blow a cloud and toss it back like yeah
Blow a cloud and toss it back like yeah
Blow a cloud and toss it back like yeah
