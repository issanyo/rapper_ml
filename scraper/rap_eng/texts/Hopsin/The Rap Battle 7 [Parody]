Yo, I'm disrespectful, on some mad rap spit
Where your mom at? I'll slap that trick
You faker than Drake's black rap accent
I'm his half past 6, Imma pack fat clips and blast online and hashtag this(DX CHOP)
Someone has to let this nigga know he's pitiful
His whole entire crew look like niggas from World Star that didn't blow
Y'all hate Hop, well he's bout to get killed by him
He dates girls online, meets 'em up, gets catfished and still wifes em

The whole world is gon root for Hop
You're the ones who making the wack rappers like Supa, hot

[SUPA HOT FIRE]
But I'm not a rapper

[Daylyt]

[HOPSIN - continued]
Ain't nothin' you can tell me
Only you making money is tryna sell weed
Witcha 1990 Saved By the Bell jeans

[Crowd slowly claps]
That was good, like, a good try - it was different, it was different!
But anyway, though
