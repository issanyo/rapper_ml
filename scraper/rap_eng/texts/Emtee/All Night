[Intro]
Yeaaa
Ambitious Baby
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Yeah

[Chorus]
As soon as the sun goes down and the lights go on
And the lights go on yeah
As soon as the weekend approaches we working, we party
We do it all night(we do it all night yeah)
We do it all night(we do it all night yeah)
We be going all night(we do it all night yeah)

[Verse 1]
You now rocking with the best
I ain't trying to flex Squad on deck
Rolling on the Jet I don’t ever rest
They show me respect sold out on the shelf
The Studio the kitchen I be working like a chef
Life so blessed I don’t know what’s next
I'm in the club if they pay me
And I am linking up with u'Sjava, ekseni?
Hit the ignition I'm feeling like R kelly
Nawe uyazi eyamadoda ayiphel
Siyajaiva siyaspana till ek'seni
I just hope my body don’t fail me now

[Chorus]
As soon as the sun goes down and the lights go on ( lights go on)
As soon as the weekend approaches we working we party
We do it all night(x2)
We be going all night(x6)

[Verse 2]
We don’t take no vacation
There’s no celebrating
Til we all make it
We don’t take no vacation
There’s no celebrating
Til we all make it

[Refrain]
Me haffi grind for me people them
Me haffi have to get up and find what I can't find
Still I'ma shine for me people for them
It could be day or night time still I'ma get mine

[Chorus]
As soon as the sun goes down and the lights go on ( lights go on)
As soon as the weekend approaches we working we party
We do it all night(x2)
We be going all night(x6)

[Refrain]
Me haffi grind for me people them
Me haffi have to get up and find what I can't find
Still I'ma shine for me people for them
It could be day or night time still I'ma get mine
