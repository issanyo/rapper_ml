[Chorus]
I wonder why it's taking so long

I wonder why it's taking so long
And why all of my friends is no show
No matter what we got to go on, go on, go on

[Verse 1]
[?] swag, you got regular mami's and that's wack
You pop bottles and all that, with your small caps
And them bitches you call bad, I just fall back
Coz I ain't into all that uh
I done fell in love with this rap shit
Pulling shit together I'm elastic
Atm baba that's it, I need a mami better than my last bitch
Make a hater nigga jam this, make a rapper nigga practice
Have em singing on my adlibs, eat girls like a savage
[?] I'm here now
I've been with it so I get it, it's fair now
I see my future hella vivid, it's clear now
Cooking hits, so I keep my bread brown
Ride with a nigga, the rhymes is a killa
Gave a fuck [?]
Shout out to my mamma coz her child is a winner
You claim to be sick and all, well I'm iller
I was really struggling, Ruff came through
And coz of him I'll always stay true
Stay away from all these fake dudes
They say they love you when they really hate you so

[Chorus]
I wonder why it's taking so long
And why all of my friends is no show
No matter what we got to go on, go on, go on
I remember what you said about me
I'm the shit how could you doubt me
I remember what you said about me
I'm the shit how could you doubt me

I wonder why it's taking so long
And why all of my friends is no show
No matter what we got to go on, go on, go on
I remember what you said about me
I'm the shit how could you doubt me
I remember what you said about me
I'm the shit how could you doubt me

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace to S.K, me and him we the illest in S.A
I'm in the game so let's play
[?] baba, so let's fade
You don't like me then that's great
I've been rapping since a youngin and that's eight
You hating on me now nigga that's fake
Bitch I do this for the fam sake
[?]
[?]
I'm getting it done, still wanna battle?
Are you kidding me son?
I know yall don't wanna see me grow
All you wanna do is be in my video
You looking at a CEO
[?]
I'm sick and tired my shit inspires
They left my hits behind
No time to sit and cry
All I gotta do is get this right
I'm here to live this life, yolo you don't live it twice
Yeah all of my shit big time, I'm gonna be the shit this time
So hit rewind

[Chorus]
I wonder why it's taking so long
And why all of my friends is no show
No matter what we got to go on, go on, go on
I remember what you said about me
I'm the shit how could you doubt me
I remember what you said about me
I'm the shit how could you doubt me

I wonder why it's taking so long
And why all of my friends is no show
No matter what we got to go on, go on, go on
I remember what you said about
I'm the shit how could you doubt me
I remember what you said about
I'm the shit how could you doubt me
