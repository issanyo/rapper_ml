[Intro]
What they saying man
You niggas got a lot to say
Got too much to say

[Verse 1]
Running round the city looking jiggy
Voices in my head keep saying go get it
They used to call me lame till I did it
Sticking to my lane, no plane I kill it
One of a kind, stay on the grind, I'ma shine
Getting high, they say one time for your mind
You see the signs, I'm finna ride on you slimes
You couldn't even speak when I was in grade 9
Ok its time to rap quit the chit chat, where you at
My nigga you wack, emotion on tracks, you a brat
Now where they do that at
Don't front like you don't know that I'm strapped
I came from the trap, you posted in my city in fact
So don't be fronting like I ain't real
Above all you great still
I just hope you ain't take pills
Starting to sound like how drake feels
Stop draking, stop faking
The people love you nigga, who the fuck is hating
Even them other rappers said the same thing
Say people are changing when you need saving
Now back to the real stuff, I'm the goat, I still do the most
I'm trynna get a ghost while you posted
I'm in the streets, spreading hope
At the same time trynna get a draco with a scope
ATM bitch I run that
Thank God I seen a milli it was run flat
I'm a brand now, I don't got a gun clap
These niggas talking but I ain't heard one fact

[Chorus]
They wanna see me down
They wanna take my crown
Mara gwa tswana
Mina ngiya spana

[Verse 2]
Round 2, never heard about you
Till them niggas found you now you in a vaal crew
16 years in the booth, don't play me, I only had myself to save me
I gave you a hit, now you acting shady
You just like all dee nigga's trynna break me
You wanna see me down, when I win you frown
You bouchie and you stupid now you losing calm down
Calm down
Calm down
Don't tell me you don't know that a nigga up now
Why you coming at the bigger artist
Bigger targets, now I see how cold your heart is
Ball so hard they call cops on me
Don't sip no liquor but these nigga's throwing shots at me
You ain't finna pop homie, yeah, you just gotta stop homie
What can I say, we wasn't raised the same
Some fall in love with the fame to cover up the pain
I'm trynna raise my son, educate my son
Show him the way it's done

[Chorus]
They wanna see me down
They wanna take my crown
Mara gwa tswana
Mina ngiya spana
