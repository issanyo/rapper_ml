[Pre-lude/Intro]
Lord I say thank you
Me haffi pray
Get on my knees and my head to the sky
When in the dark
Hella lost
Help me shine little light of mine (you got to know that)

[Chorus]
Umntu ngumntu ngabantu nam ndingumntu ngabantu (you got to know that)
Umntu ngumntu ngabantu nam ndingumntu ngabantu (what you done know)
Ndiyabulela bhuti, ndiyabulela sisi (you got to know that)
Ndiyabulela mama, ndiyabulela tata (you got to know that)

[Verse 1]
You give me the love I need
You let me be who I wanna be (ndiyakuthanda)
You give me the love I need
You let me be who I wanna be (ndiyakuthanda)
Yimithandazo yenu
Nobubele benu
Oh you could've been doing something else with your life
But you chose to be here by my side
So, me haffi thank you
Me haffi change your life and mine
Lord I say thank you
Me haffi pray
Get on my knees and my head to the sky
When in the dark
Hella lost
Help me shine little light of mine (you got to know that)

[Chorus]
Umntu ngumntu ngabantu nam ndingumntu ngabantu (you got to know that)
Umntu ngumntu ngabantu nam ndingumntu ngabantu (what you done know)
Ndiyabulela bhuti, ndiyabulela sisi (you got to know that)
Ndiyabulela mama, ndiyabulela tata (you got to know that)

[Verse 2]
Give me the love I need
Let me be who I wanna be, ngiyakuthanda
Give me the love I need
Let me be who I wanna be, ngiyakuthanda
My people gas me up
Mama said they would respect me
I went passed these so called thugs, didn't even address me (no)
They show me love, they know I'm up
I double cup and I came from the dust
Ok, I'm blowing up, Avery growing up
I be with the squad
We toasting up
Lord I say thank you
Me haffi pray
Get on my knees and my head to the sky
When in the dark
Hella lost
Help me shine little light of mine

[Chorus]
Umntu ngumntu ngabantu nam ndingumntu ngabantu (you got to know that)
Umntu ngumntu ngabantu nam ndingumntu ngabantu (what you done know)
Ndiyabulela bhuti, ndiyabulela sisi (you got to know that)
Ndiyabulela mama, ndiyabulela tata (you got to know that)
