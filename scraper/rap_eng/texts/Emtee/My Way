[Chorus: Sims]
I feel like I can just take off and just go away
I feel like this world isn’t made for people like me
Please let me live my life
Please don’t come my way
Please let me live my life
Please let me live my life

[Verse 1: Emtee]
I don’t think I would have did it on my own
Had the landlord blowing on my phone
My nigga I ain't had a home
But my partner dem told me I am goals
Never thought that I would have kill it at the Dome
My first vid? Scrooge shot it with a drone
No man is an island and you know
Could have never did it on my own
I be going hotter than a stove
Best jets in the land when we smoke
Told my nigga don't quit work
Told my mama we gon' make this shit work
And that bitch that didn't love me wanna twerk
Whole team be the wave y'all surf
Hit the restaurant and just order dessert
Ain't talking waffles bitch you know I'm 'bout to serve

[Chorus: Sims]
I feel like I can just take off and just go away
I feel like this world isn’t made for people like me
Please let me live my life
Please don’t come my way
Please let me live my life
Please let me live my life

[Verse 2: Emtee]
Mama told me I'm a winner
Dankie mdali ngisaphila
Where y'all where was at when I was thinner?
When I couldn't take my girl out for no dinner?
Man it was problem after problem bekunyiwa
I was trapping at the stu' namajita
God got me
Pops got me
Not forgetting amajita daar ekasi
Pull up 50 deep, you nahmean?
Akekho omunye opheth' istyle sami
Goons in position you can never drive-by me
I'm a star my G chela la asidakwi
Catch me on the fast lane with a Mary Jane
Ntwana I'm a mogul ngicela ninghloniphen'
They don't understand it or even comprehend
It's just me myself and I and these hella chains

[Chorus: Sims]
I feel like I can just take off and just go away
I feel like this world isn’t made for people like me
Please let me live my life
Please don’t come my way
Please let me live my life
Please let me live my life
