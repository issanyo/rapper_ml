[Chorus]
I've been waiting for a sign from above
See I need love
I need love
Just like you do babe
See I need love
I need love
I've been waiting for a sign from above
See I need love
I need love, just like you do

[Verse 1]
If the police looking for me would you hide me
When I fall would you be by my side
I did you wrong in the past I'm sorry, Lord knows you the wifey
I ain't even playing, baby you the main
When it gets tough I get on my knees and pray
I'm no romeo or superman, in my future baby you the plan
I just hope you understand, I want you to have my band
Love you to death hope you feel the same
Hope them feelings never change
You'd call me everyday I don't do the same yeah I take the blame
[?] xoliswa sweety, shit is getting tricky, I ain't even picky
[?] fifty fifty

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for a sign from above babe
See I need love
I need love
Just like you do babe
See I need love
I need love
I've been waiting for a sign from above babe
See I need love

[Verse 2 - Saudi]
I need love, just like you do
But if I have a reason to love you don't that mean that love is conditional yeah
Fall asleep in my arms
And wake up in my dreams
Love is a drug and baby you my plug
So baby [?]
[?]
[?] come between us
[?] like I do in my music
And keep me close to your heart like a stethoscope

[Chorus]
I've been waiting from a sign from above
See I need love
I need love
Just like you do babe
See I need love
I need love
I've been waiting from a sign from above
Just like you do
I need love, just like you do
See I need love
I need love
