DreamTeam
What you know bout that
Gang, gang

[Hook]
Call me Sosa
Bitches call me Sosha
Every time I step up to the plate
Yeah it's a home-run
Wena unomona
Thina siyamosha
Every time you find us in the spot
You know we sober
We don’t give a fuck
S'jaiva kuze kuse
We don't give a fuck
Ngithi thel’ utshwala sphuze
We don't give a fuck
S'jaiva kuze kuse
We don't give a fuck
Ngithi thel' utshwala sphuze

[Verse 1: Emtee]
They calling me Sosha
Ke bolaya Portia
I'm never sober
I'm Mr Roll Up
I'm bout to pour up
Runnin’ outta soda
Up in the jungle you gotta hustle
I am a soldier
When I’m in the hood bitches run out
Where I live it's a crib and a fun house
Buff niggas at the door with the gun out
If I send them to you
They be there in less than one hour
I be on my grind
Some of them relate
Pushing all the time
No I don’t skuif
Beningyenz' isnaai
Bafana bami letha
Let the boy shine
Ngizobangena nang' uSway
I been working all day
Can't starve, no way
So I’m chopping ey day, ey day
It's a challenge
Hope a young nigga manage
I'm all about the green fuck a salad or a cabbage

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Saso and Trey(DreamTeam)]
I be smoking, y'all be chokin'
I'm a stand-up nigga, fuck the joking
I'm the man, go figure, check the bossin'
Catch me on the gram, understand overloading
I be soaking all the cheese up
Get your money get your Gs up
Demonstrate, the remix is the re-up
Lifestyle on fees up
Kick back, put my feet up
And they know, never phone never freeze up
If I'm sipping just leave alone
You know your mami wanna give me dome
Pulled up with her friend, I might take them both
Babona mina bathi nali isosha
But you know that I'm just chilling
Pulled up with Manando so we 'bout to make a killing
Buy it off Makhado tell your nigga fuck his feelings
Self esteem like it's limbo while we take it to the ceiling

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Reason]
I step up to the plate I'm casual
Knock it out the park I have to though
Got no diamonds but then when I'm rhyming
I'm a superstar that always has to glow
All you niggas soundin' fashionable
My material is casual
Word to Stogie man I had to though
I snatch the focus like a cameltoe
Okay back to business
Think it's ass for lyrics
Bitches asking if I'm home alone
I say wait a minute I'm in renovations
Tryna fix a broken home
Let me keep a different
And just say to niggas I don't ever wanna smash your hoes
I'll never fuck the women that you been with
'Cause I'm never ever coming after you
Ready the ball, whatchu sayin when I'm passing you
I got hit in the vault
If you need them I can pass the code
Y'all niggas is phony
You think rapper are some cats with dough
Just got me some money
I'm guessing I'm one and a half of you

[Hook]
