[Chorus]
Without you I'm nothing
You turned me into something, yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be a ghetto hero, yeah yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be a ghetto hero, yeah yeah
Something like Steve Biko, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse]
It's been a long time coming
Besispana kodwa singay'boni imali
Siqabana nabazali endlini abasakwazi
You know they gonna worry
At the same time chasing the dream sthath' amachansi
Now I pull up in a 45
Rocking them Jordan 5s
Watch the hood come alive
Zero to hero
Story of my life
Repping the ghetto child
I make the ghetto smile
And I'm here for a while
All I wanna be is a hero to another kid
Spana kuzolunga mpinch
Mind your own business
And if you fall get back on some other shit
Fede bazok'phazamisa, ungabanaki please
I be on the grind working for my people
Lil' kids know me as their hero
Rest in peace great Steve Biko
I was trapping kilos, now we adding zeros

[Chorus]
Without you I'm nothing
You turned me into something, yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be a ghetto hero, yeah yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be a ghetto hero, yeah yeah
Something like Steve Biko, yeah yeah yeah

[Bridge]
Ungakhali mama
Kuzolunga k'sasa
Yonk' imihla siyathandaza, yeah, yeah
I was born in the ghetto emikhukhwini, yeah, yeah
Ngiyimbali ekhulele ebuxwini*

[Chorus]
Without you I'm nothing (You already know that!)
You turned me into something, yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be a ghetto hero, yeah yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be a ghetto hero, yeah yeah
Something like Steve Biko, yeah yeah yeah
Without you I'm nothing
You turned me into something, yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be a ghetto hero, yeah yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be a ghetto hero, yeah yeah
Something like Steve Biko, yeah yeah yeah
