[Intro]
What I do
What I do

[Verse 1]
I just pulled up ekasi naba ngani bami
Swag on the hunnid
At the corner store with all my phandas
On the grind holla if you wanna
Now they looking at me funny
Like I shouldn't be getting this money
Now they looking at me funny
Like I shouldn't be getting this money
I got the 1.25 sip sip sip, scoop a few times
2 joints in my pockets just because a young nigga too fly
You don't know where I bees at
Iâ€™m just minding my beeswax
Steady countin' up these stacks
Hella bars, C Max

[Pre-Chorus]
Asikh' iskhathi sok'jola
Manje seng'funa 'ma dollar
Uyashisa mdoko phola
Ngob' iscima lana ungas'thola

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
So much much dough
I'm tryna spend it at the corner store
Max out then I make some more
Abasang' nyatsi anymore

[Verse 2]
I just ran up the money
Now they looking at me funny when they know I'm hustling
OGs put me on 'cause they know I keep seeing one hundred
And they don't underestimate me no more
I'm the one to tell the shooter, "See who's at the door"
I'll be on top 'cause I'm smoking hydro
And I see these rappers tryna steal my flow
Just as long as they don't never steal my goal
That's when you will know that I ain't smiling no more

[Pre-Chorus]
Asikh' iskhathi sok'jola
Manje seng'funa 'ma dollar
Uyashisa mdoko phola
Ngob' iscima lana ungas'thola

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
So much much dough
I'm tryna spend it at the corner store
Max out then I make some more
Abasang' nyatsi anymore

[Verse 3]
Got my loot up, I'm moving up
And soon enough I'ma get the power
Steady dissing me when I was broke
Now shit is getting really sour
I was raised by the Hillbrow tower
Hustling in the early hours
At the crib just to take a shower
Back to the grind, we burn up the flower, aye
Ngiyakhumbula tryna make it a deal
Bekuntswempu ntwana it was real
I still remember how it feel
Even in the Winter we would chill
I had nothing, they hated me still
Sleeping in my drank, get hurt if you spill
I don't care how you feel
Dawg, my shooter he kill

[Pre-Chorus]
Asikh' iskhathi sok'jola
Manje seng'funa 'ma dollar
Uyashisa mdoko phola
Ngob' iscima lana ungas'thola

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
So much much dough
I'm tryna spend it at the corner store
Max out then I make some more
Abasang' nyatsi anymore
