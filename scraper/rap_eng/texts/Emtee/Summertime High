I don't know you what you heard about me

[Chorus]
I don't know you what you heard about me
They should've told you to never doubt me
That's a story for another day
Life is too beautiful, I celebrate
They think I'ma flop now I'm riding with the top down
And I came from uptown yeah
Summertime High
Smoking on a doobie every time I drive by
Summertime High
Summertime

[Verse 1]
Me and my ninjas we done moved to the north
Thank God I had rid in a Porsche
And I'm bout to cop my girl that Michael Kors
Vroom Vroom that's the power of the horse (Yeah)
As a youngin I was hella with the chores
Now they asking who run it, yeah me of course
Fuck with me my nigga hit you in the jaws
All these awards, they said take it it's yours
Ane vele mina 'khule nyi ibineplaas
Manje s'khosi traffic masithi si ngeni kasi
If you trynna hate
Nyege ube Ne chance!
Bathi ntwana useyaphila
Uthenye ne transi!

[Chorus]
I don't know you what you heard about me
They should've told you to never doubt me
That's a story for another day
Life is too beautiful, I celebrate
They think I'ma flop now I'm riding with the top down
And I came from uptown yeah
Summertime High
Smoking on a doobie every time I drive by
Summertime High
Summertime

[Verse 2]
ATM boys check the invoice
Your sister's biggest dream is fucking one of them boys
I might just let a groupie mammi's dreams reality
Put a double cup in my coffin when they bury me
And I am higher than a bitch I am levitating
And my eyes lower than a hater's expectations
The way I'm swaggin I am feeling like I'm Lil Wayne's father
Spilling lean on my new Balenciaga's
Preach!!
Find me with mammies (?)
Rocking Rihanna Fenty
Superga look like a (?)
She is attached to my dick
Preach
And I don't know what it is you heard about me
But we living on this side ne bagani bami

[Chorus]
I don't know you what you heard about me
They should've told you to never doubt me
That's a story for another day
Life is too beautiful, I celebrate
They think I'ma flop now I'm riding with the top down
And I came from uptown yeah
Summertime High
Smoking on a doobie every time I drive by
Summertime High
Summertime
