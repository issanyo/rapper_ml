[Hook: Sjava]
Baba siza naba abantwana bakho

Siyacindezela nezinja zami
Baphel' abantu weeh
Baba siza naba abantwana bakho

Siyacindezela nezinja zami
Baphela abantu weeh

[Verse 1: eMTee]
Sithe mas’ngena sathel' inyongo
I told my boss that I’m ready though
I am the one just let it go
I’m here let’s move dedeli flow
She didn’t love me
Now she want me
I do not fuck with her anymore
I don’t give a damn she already know
I’m getting dough
And killing shows
You want a show?
Tlisa chelete
Awubheke nje
Skeem sphelele
Dressed in all black, call me Mkhelele
Vele singenelele, siphumelele
I’ve been sitting ‘n watching niggas ball
And now the same niggas is hoping I fall
They hated even when I had nothing at all
I can fuck your plans up
Don’t make me make that one call

[Verse 2: Saudi]

But they never wan't me ke kgone
Ba kgale ba bona le bonna
Amen to tsotle

[Verse 4: A-Reece]
You feelin' yourself when I'm not around
Your girl is with me if she not around
I wouldn't want you to see it though
I got my kids dippin' in her mouth
Yeah yeah, It's a movie
And you ain't doin' nothin' to me
I got a gang that like shootin'
Click , Clack , Braat , Pew-Pewin'!
I don't think you niggas get the picture
Switch on your mobile data
Skeemi, I don't think you niggas get the filters
Switch on your photo edit, skeemi
Bona
It's about the figures
Yeah, the dough
It's about us winners
Nothing more
Couple of things that I want you to know
Don't you be talking when I'm on the phone

[Verse 5: Jay Jody (B3nchMarQ)]
I got famous off of 8 lines (washa, washa)
Came back with hard bars
Like I did jail time (ke satlo letlatsa)
Now some of these rappers asking me for membership
But these rappers gossip
I don't tell em shit
Tsela thupa for the hell of it
I blow moola, got the hang of it
All they see is us, bona fela
They got the cheese up, mozarella
Tsek nawe ya
Hamba oba tshela
One by one
Yeah, bazophela
Oh no, this ain't illuminati
This is pusha, phanda
Get the nyuku s'bali
This is catch a body
With a verse buddy
Yeah you trash
They then get music like [?]

[Verse 6: TKay (B3nchMarQ)]
Thixo bathethelele laba shana
My side is a Pearl
You can call me Marawa
No Sbu uyakhena
I got the Mo'Faya
I'm bringing the Flava
Like Mo with no Rajah
The summer is mine
You can call me Zahara
No!!
Nigga don't call me Zahara
Everybody know ke skeema lephara
I got the patient, I'm kinda like Bara
They ride me like a Navara
Now I be shopping at Zara
I'm in a DreamTeam
Busa no Khuli ne Chana
I'm making headlights
Now you can call me a barber
Uya baba lomfana
My team is so upper
You winning lebhala like no baba
