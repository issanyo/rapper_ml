Verse 1(Emtee)
I just wanna be a hero to all of the people told me that I would be something
I just wanna see my son living life watching levels and not forgetting that daddy is hustling
I know we gonna make it
I just wanna be your favourite
These are the things that I wanna do
I could go all day but
Lord please keep mama safe
Am tryna move to another place
See her smile on her face
My son feel like rock polo forever
Just to show him daddy kept it together
Him struggle like me no never
He was born and I  climbed up the ladder
Now they know my name
They love my chase
For my people me I will never change
Chorus(emtee)
Somebody pray for me x2
If u knew what am going through
Verse2(emtee)
He say she say who gives a damn
All this talk got me going ham
Me I stuck to the plan
I sing I write and I needed a bang
I know that mama is praying
Em haters have forgot all of the shit they were saying
Am bout to go super sayine
They still think  am playing
Came from the bottom got high like jamaican
Me I'm an artist  focus on your day shift
Don't say shit especially if your swagger is just basic
Hommie just face it I got the juice nizogcwala
La ang'fikanga mahala
I got the juice nizogcwala
Swag game got a B on a hanna
I had a dream that I buzzing rihanna
Chorus
Verse 3(emtee)
