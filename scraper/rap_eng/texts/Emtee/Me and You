[Chorus: Emtee]
This could’ve been me and you
Waking up to this ocean view
What am I supposed to do?
I do what I gotta do
Nkari ke maobane baby
When everything seemed alright
Used to call me when you wanted baby
And now you don’t even say hi

[Verse 1: Tiwa Savage]
It’s funny how you put it on me
Really? Yourself you know how much I really want it
It’s never been about the money, you feel me?
Because I tried, I tried you know I tried
For how long a girl gotta hold on?
You know I've been strong for too long
Kicking it with you all day long
Kill all my show, kill all my show baby
You know say I dey craze for you
You know say I dey craze for you, yeah
I dey try everyday just to give you something new

[Chorus: Emtee]
This could’ve been me and you
Waking up to this ocean view
What am I supposed to do?
I do what I gotta do
Nkari ke maobane baby
When everything seemed alright
Used to call me when you wanted baby
And now you don’t even say hi

[Verse 2: Emtee]
You've got me overthinking
I had you cooking in the kitchen
I'd tell you everything and you would listen
And now you're looking at me differently
Mina nawe bes' mokola
Be ung'thanda noma besokola
Started going to clubs with the top ballers
Why you mad when I'm performing across borders?
I hope he's treating you right
Even though he came through like a thief in the night
It's okay, It's alright
I'm moving on by, in the north-side
My life too lit, I'm on new shit
You and your boyfriend looking all stupid
You planning on having 2 kids
Zap sign, index, that's deuces

[Chorus: Emtee]
This could’ve been me and you
Waking up to this ocean view
What am I supposed to do?
I do what I gotta do
Nkari ke maobane baby
When everything seemed alright
Used to call me when you wanted baby
And now you don’t even say hi

[Chorus: Emtee]
This could’ve been me and you
Waking up to this ocean view
What am I supposed to do?
I do what I gotta do
Gotta get my money baby
When everything seemed alright
Used to call me when you wanted baby
And now you don’t even say hie
