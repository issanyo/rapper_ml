[Hook]
I need an older mummy, I don't need drama
Ng'funa usisi o-top
O'ne steez nyana
Ophethe izaka
Ophil' is'cheese ntwana
Angilalanga since I saw u on TV mama
Pearl Thusi, Pearl Thusi, Pearl Thusi
Hey I'm talking about Pearl Thusi
Pearl Thusi, Pearl Thusi, Pearl Thusi
Hey I'm talking about Pearl Thusi

[Verse 1]
She's the best, I don't see the rest
I don't need a pest
With all due respect, she can get it for days
I'll never say it straight to her face
Look how she rocking them Jays
She getting money in so many ways
She's Zulu and yellow
Grew up in the ghetto
Khohlwa iy'nto eyningi sisi zwakala nganeno
Mina ngimbiza ngoXola
She got her own, uyaphola
The beauty, the booty, the boobies, the moola
Yonk' into ihleli nge-order
Aka fak' ama-Weave
Upheth' ama-cheese, she's rolling them trees
Ningang' judge-ke please
I'm loving her steez, she's all that I need

[Bridge]
She a ten out of ten
Ngenze uBen Ten
Angfun' i-girlfriend, ngifuna ibest friend
Roll up the jets then spend

[Hook]
I need an older mummy, I don't need drama
Ng'funa usisi o-top
O'ne steez nyana
Ophethe izaka
Ophil' is'cheese ntwana
Angilalanga since I saw u on TV mama
Pearl Thusi, Pearl Thusi, Pearl Thusi
Hey I'm talking about Pearl Thusi
Pearl Thusi, Pearl Thusi, Pearl Thusi
Hey I'm talking about Pearl Thusi

[Verse 2]
Ngukhathele ilabo takalanin nemigwanthi ephapha kakhulu
Badakwa kakhulu, bathanda abomkhulu
Baphuma eb'suku
Mina ngizithandela uPearl, She is the realest, f**k what you heard
Damnit she's fly, all you bitches is birds
She made it, that's what she deserves
Sisi ngiyagcwala mina
Ngabe ngizok'bamba nini?
Ucathi ngiyadlala yini?
Ngifisa uk'yolala kini
Anginandaba if you're all over my tv
Swag like Riri
Just more pretty
Lames in that bikini
Ngizokwenz' ukhohlwe ngo-Walter
Play games with your daughter
Ngathi ngak'bona
Sithi uk'bonder
Senze izinto zakhona

[Bridge]
She a ten out of ten
Ngenze uBen Ten
Angifun' i-girlfriend, ngifuna i-best friend
Roll up the jets then spend

[Hook]
I need an older mummy, I don't need drama
Ng'funa usisi o-top
O'ne steez nyana
Ophethe izaka
Ophil' is'cheese ntwana
Angilalanga since I saw u on TV mama
Pearl Thusi, Pearl Thusi, Pearl Thusi
Hey I'm talking about Pearl Thusi
