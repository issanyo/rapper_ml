[Verse 1]
They don't know what's coming
They used to say I won't be nothing
I started this without no money
Now I'm at these stages even on a Monday
All my haters looking bummy
While I parlying like taking it easy like Sunday
All my niggas looking stundee
We steady rumbling,  we getting dough, you getting dumpling
All that talk is nothing, show me something
A lot is on my mind, I think about it all the time
Am I ever gonna shine, but for now I'm getting mine
I jump in the booth, I tell the truth
Smoke in the room, shooting movies like I'm Benny boom
I don't owe you [?]

Cause traffic when we come through
Just riding around with my dudes

[Chorus]
They don't know what I'm saying
But they dancing and they wave yeah
They don't care what I'm saying
But they dancing and they wave yeah

[Verse 2]
Like a G, flying over seas, lighting up the trees
High as I can be, sign to my enemies, all of them can pree
[?], escalate with the shotta
[?], won awards [?] Gaza
Did a show in Mauritius, I'm talking where she flew
Over Madagascar, still copping at the spaza
I'm just a young real black guy
Haters think I'm flexing ey ey
But where I'm from this is a blessing ey ey
I grew up and learned some lessons ey ey
No longer stressing ey ey
This is a blessing ey ey
They still think I'm flexing no oh
I learnt some lessons ey ey
If she ride [?] blessing ey ey
Get on my [?] like everyday

[Chorus]
They don't know what I'm saying
But they dancing and they wave yeah
They don't care what I'm saying
But they dancing and they wave yeah
