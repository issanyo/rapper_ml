[Verse 1]
So many people have changed on me
Less love but the hate on fleek
I ain't never been a fake homie
They putting a lot of weight on me
But that's nothing, I'm that younging
Gangsters love me and I got the trap jumping
Pull up at event, dabbing with the kids
Give em a little hope yeah now that's something
I been through the worst
The pain and the stress and the hurt
Told myself this ain't what I deserve
Had to make sure a younging was hurt
Through the hunger the drought the thirst
I was close to laying in a hurse
It's funny how I got saved by these verses
Show respect my name written incursive I prayed in them churches
Yeah Mama was there for me
Some homies didn’t care for me
But dad helped me choose friends carefully
And I was never treated specially
So ngavuka ngaphanda

[Verse 2]
Regular niggas be hating on me
They congratulate low key
Acting like they know me
Like we back in the day homie
I'm living my dream, hope Manando can see me
I wish lefatsi was easy
They ask for money, they saw me on TV
When all I wanna do is give to the needy
I never had nothing, how can I be greedy
I'm working hard, I don't want a freebie
