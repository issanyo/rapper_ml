[Verse]
Lotta shit is on my mind I don't wanna waste time
Get the paper coz I grind they be spying trynna find
What the fuck is on my mind
To a hater yeah I’m blind
I'm a boss yeah I sign, put a fuck nigga in line
I've been working that’s for certain, and I keep it low key
Why the fuck these niggas acting like they know me
Got some money show me, maybe we can close deal
I be with the OG's, and they talking more g's
If I was you I would shut up, coz I'm the gangster here
Cribby got the chandeliers, I just had a [?] year
Rooms full of [?]
Balling like we [?], none of you niggas dabbing here
Lotta you niggas capping yeah

And I ain't talking to the press

Switching up the whole sit', till we all get rich
