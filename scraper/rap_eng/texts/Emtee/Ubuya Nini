[Intro]
Woah

[Chorus]
Ng'yaphanda ntanga ebsuku nasemini
Silwi indlala in the city of sin yeah
Khumbulekhaya but I came here to win yeah
Bayabuza endlini
Awusabuyi kwedini
Ubuya Nini
Ubuya Nini na
I don't know but I'm getting to the bag baby
Ubuya Nini
Ubuya Nini na
I don't know but I'm getting to the bag baby

[Verse 1]
Damn I miss my fam baby, doubt you understand baby
I been really sad lately, this life is mad crazy
But I'm a soldier and angipheli umoya
Been a pimp since a younging, bengdlel' umona
Now the ganja I'm smoking is very strong
Tell my people the journey is very long
Life was really sad baby, I was in the trap baby
Grew up in the hood eating food out them pans baby
Lurking by the trash baby, doing what I can baby
Never getting cash payments, going through some mad phases

[Bridge]
That's why I never take this for granted, I'm thankful
Konke kukuwe Mdali wami I know you planned it
I'm dreaming bout a grammy
I still miss my family, cousins and my granny
London I just landed

[Chorus]
Ng'yaphanda ntanga ebsuku nasemini
Silwi indlala in the city of sin yeah
Khumbulekhaya but I came here to win yeah
Bayabuza endlini
Awusabuyi kwedini
Ubuya Nini
Ubuya Nini na
I don't know but I'm getting to the bag baby
Ubuya Nini
Ubuya Nini na
I don't know but I'm getting to the bag

[Verse 2]
Tshel' uMagriza wami (I'm getting to the bag)
Tshel' iOlady lami (I'm getting to the bag)
Tshel' iTyma lami (I'm getting to the bag)
Tshel' iSister lami (I'm getting to the bag)
Doing this for some years, mama keeps me in her prayers
I done lost a couple friends and I'm still going in
And I'm going for the win
Lomhlaba uyahlaba bafana niyazi
Bambelela gazi, makubheda ungafi, hlonipha abazali
And get to the money, ungakhathali

[Bridge]
That's why I never take this for granted, I'm thankful
Konke kukuwe Mdali wami I know you planned it
I'm dreaming bout a grammy
I still miss my family, cousins and my granny
London I just landed

[Chorus]
Ng'yaphanda ntanga ebsuku nasemini
Silwi indlala in the city of sin yeah
Khumbulekhaya but I came here to win yeah
Bayabuza endlini

I don't know but I'm getting to the bag baby
Ubuya Nini

I don't know but I'm getting to the bag
