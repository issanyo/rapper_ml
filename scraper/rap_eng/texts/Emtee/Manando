[Verse 1]
I remember in High school yea
Barnato was my school yea
Manando was gangster man
He was no wankster big homie was my dude yeah
Bekengazwani namasimba
He taught me how to play marimba
He was real he wasn't no pretender
Beat your whole squad up, he had no contender
Lose a tooth if you talking the foolery
He fucked them up when them niggas would bully me
Make you say sorry then take all your jewelry
Rappers think they gangster that is not new to me
A nigga tried to steal his blazer
Pussy nigga brought it back later
Rob some niggas then pass me the paper
Just so I can get a haircut
It was after school when they pulled up
They tried to run up on the school bus
Manando the saviour he took off his blazer
Damn, my nigga too nuts
I'm proud to say he fucked 'em all up
He did it for all us
He hella crazy but it's all love
He said I'ma grind till we all up
That's my nigga Manando

[Pre-Chorus]
Manando the reason I did it, yea
I’m putting on for my city, yea
My nigga died he was 20, yea
I heard them shots go up in the air
Now they know me everywhere
Manando the reason I did it, yea
Yeah, yea
Yeah, yea

[Chorus]
Yeah
Manando, Manando (yeah)
Damn they done shot up Manando (yeah)
Manando, Manando
Damn they done shot up my nigga (yeah)
Manando, Manando (yeah)
Damn they done shot up Manando
(Right at the hood)
Manando, Manando
(Right in the hood on the streets)

[Verse 2]
I lost umkhulu and then we lost SK
They say I'm illuminati, blame me the next day
And I figured it out, some of my friends fake
I pray on my own, you will never hear me saying: "Let's pray"
Now back to Manando, we be at the bando
My nigga a warrior akanavalo
He packing that heat, he running the streets
He rock Ferragamo, on a regular steez
Friends with the police
He posting up and he make the rules
He told me that I'm gonna make it too
He's not the nigga that you make a fool
One day I saw him trynna pack a tool
He told me some niggas was looking for him
Not the police in their uniform
He MIA, and he laying low
If you need anything ntwana say so
Nigga why you calling from a pay phone
Your brother told me you ain't stay at home
A week or two went by, they told me homie just died
It hurts to see his mamma cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Manando the reason I did it, yea
I’m putting on for my city, yea
My nigga died he was 20, yea
I heard them shots go up in the air
Now they know me everywhere
Manando the reason I did it, yea
Yeah, yea
Yeah, yea

[Chorus]
Yeah
Manando, Manando (yeah)
Damn they done shot up Manando (yeah)
Manando, Manando
Damn they done shot up my nigga (yeah)
Manando, Manando (yeah)
Damn they done shot up Manando
(Right at the hood)
Manando, Manando
(Right in the hood on the streets)
I'm missing my nigga Manando
