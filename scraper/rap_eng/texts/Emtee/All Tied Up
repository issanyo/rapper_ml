Verse 1
Would you believe in a time and a space like this?
It was just about half past crazy
I was wodnering if this could be bliss?

Now I’m a stranger in this wonderland
I’m a one man band
But I moved from the past now baby
Almost feels like the first kiss

Pre-Chorus
When you can't hold onto your heart
Can't hold onto your love
Can't hold on with both hands
I just can't understand, how you held onto your fears
Held on for all these years
You held on to your pride
I finally realised that

Chorus
I was all tied up
My minds made up
And when you showed me love
T’was like a hand in glove

I was all tied up
My minds made up
And when you showed me love
T’was like a hand in glove

Verse 2
Didn’t wanna believe that a love like this…
Two people living in harmony
Singing two different melodies
Syncpating on the same beat
Might’ve been strangers
Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away
A shooting star suddenly passed my way
It’s like I’m out my first days

Pre-Chorus
When you can't hold onto your soul
Can't hold onto your light
Can't hold on with both hands
I just can't understand how you held onto your tears
Held on and no one hears
You held on to your pride
Finally realised that

Chorus
I was all tied up
My minds made up
And when you showed me love
T’was like a hand in glove

I was all tied up
My minds made up
And when you showed me love
T’was like a hand in glove

I was all tied up
My minds made up
And when you showed me love
T’was like a hand in glove

I was all tied up
My minds made up
And when you showed me love
T’was like a hand in glove
