[Intro]
Yeah
Ey man, and you asked yourself why I smoke too much
Or drank too much or get cranked up

[Chorus]
I'm too young for this shit
Need a few puffs and my two cups
Get screwed up and get lit(turn up)
Eh, Phethoguluva abaningi
Uyangthusa
Uyazthutsa
[?]
Just wait until I take flight, take flight, take flight
Until I get right, get right, get right
Just wait until I Take flight, take flight, take flight
Until I, get right, get right, get right

[Verse 1]
Nobody told me I'm the man
Nobody really understands
Nobody cared about my plans
Nobody told me that I can
Fourteen years rapping
Shout out to my nigga Sam
Still performed without a single fan
Time was ticking I was going HAM
I was hardly happy pretty often
Mamma was a hawker
She didn't know a office
But I swear I'ma buy her a crib
Before I ever see a coffin
Since I was a youngn, they said I was nothing
Now they only see me on their tv
And the kids wanna be me
Regular kid did it big
How could you frown when I'm beaming
Mama told me: Thantazelenkosini
Maybe nathi singaphumehontjini
Umalume angaphumestoksini
Ugogo wami bekesthumeposini yeah
Imagine coming back with nothing
Walking home seeing rich niggas stuntin
I said fuck it and started hustling
If I don't, then I'ma be suffering

[Chorus]
I'm too young for this shit
Need a few puffs and my two cups
Get screwed up and get lit
Eh, Phethoguluva abaningi
Uyangthusa
Uyazthutsa
[?]
Just wait until I take flight, take flight, take flight
Until I, get right, get right, get right
Just wait until I take flight, take flight, take flight
Until I, get right, get right, get right

[Verse 2]
Back when shooting hoops was balling
I used to envy your Jordans
Put it all in a song and record it
These shoes I'm wearing is imported
Yeah bitch I bought it, never ever been to college
So I'ma be broke if I stop this
Now I pull up at the store and cop it
Nobody told me I'm the future
Well I guess I'm the present
I am so relevant trending the internet
Shaming my many men, who better than
To each his own, I'm BET known
I know you niggas wish to be in my zone
They said I won't make it with talent alone
Now I just make hits, get blown
Spholile laskhona
Ababhaya sebafuna nokubloma
Mine angidlali ngibashaya ngebhomu
Phela manje ngstrong
Cava my song, dlala my dlala my song
Fuck up the zakka can't wait too long
And I ain't trynna be on the lane you on
I'm way too strong

[Chorus]
I'm too young for this shit
Need a few puffs and my two cups
Get screwed up and get lit
Eh, Phethoguluva abaningi
Uyangthusa
