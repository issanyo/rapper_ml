[Chorus: Sjava]
Ngithi mangikhumbula (mang'khumbula)
Lapho ngiphuma khona (phumakhona)
Bekhungekho lula
But I made it anyway
Ngithi mangikhumbula mama (mang'khumbula)
Lapho ngiphuma khona (phumakhona)
Bekhungekho lula
But I made it anyway

[Verse 1: Sjava]
Kwakungekona ukuhlakanipha kwam'
Nam’ ngasizwa yinkab’ zam'
UMama wathi ngibonise abangani bakho
And I will show you your future

Talking Hendrix
Abesekho abangani
Mawumtholile bong' umdali
Ngoba la ngaphandle
Kunzima ngiyatshela wemfethu
Sihamba ney'nyoka
Inyoka eziy'biza abafwethu
I thank God for le'ynkab' enginazo
Lokhu ngiphusha ngiphanda nazo
They saved me
Bafakha iFull tank
Maku "E" (yeah! yeah!)

[Chorus: Sjava]
Ngithi mangikhumbula (mang'khumbula)
Lapho ngiphuma khona (phumakhona)
Bekhungekho lula
But I made it anyway
Ngithi mangikhumbula mama (mang'khumbula)
Lapho ngiphuma khona (phumakhona)
Bekhungekho lula
But I made it anyway

[Verse 2: Saudi]
UMama told me not to trust abangani
Where I grew up there is no opportunity
Just drugs and violence Avalon and Sun City
Amagumsha are the only ones feeding their families
All my life I believed I would be nothing
When you become the one they treat you like a king
UMama methi watch the company you keep
But if it wasn't for abangani bami
Where would Msotra be?
Ingelozi zami, zangenza umuntu ebantwini
Right when I thought uNkulunkulu ukhohliwe ngami
Akanandaba ngami
Nga-give(apha) nami
If it wasn't for bona laba abangani bami
Ngabe k'phelile ngami
USatane could've really really had his way with me
UMama methi watch the company you keep
Today I'm glad ukuthi I didn't listen

[Chorus:Sjava]
Ngithi mangikhumbula (mang'khumbula)
Lapho ngiphuma khona (phumakhona)
Bekhungekho lula
But I made it anyway
Ngithi mangikhumbula mama (mang'khumbula)
Lapho ngiphuma khona (phumakhona)
Bekhungekho lula
But I made it anyway

[Verse 3: Emtee]
Uman'gkhumbula (I remember, I remember)
Emakhaya
Beyingekho i-creche
Me and my cousins used to play
Ngiyakhumbulaya
Ngale kwezintaba
Beyingekho imvula
One day, I'm gonna make it rain
Ngisakhumbula
Ngibulalwa indlala
Bekungekho ukudla
You don't know the hunger pains
Kwakunokushuba
Lapho eng'phuma khona
Bekungekho lula
But the Lord will make a way
