[Intro: DJ Slim]
Rockstar DJ
Ladies and gentlemen it is time to win
It's time to phanda mo
My name is DJ Slim and I'm the rockstar DJ
Let's get it

[Verse 1: Yanga]
Mfana, I've been here before
Been back and forth
Been back and forth with a car that's imported
I've been at the bottom before si ba godly
Before si ne shawty e tswembu and a story
Before si ne choice if we stumbled and fall
I came up from it all
Siya phanda my boy
Now the realest, they feel us
And their middle fingers won't get up or come at your boy
Basikelele madoda
[?]
I karateka the door
Ngithatha abothekeni by taking a shot
Cause nobody gave me a shot
I'm just overtaking and taking my spot
I shine on these stages, in front of these pages
Exchanging these changes with fate and my God
I'm sonning your favourites, don't take a day off

[Hook: Tshego]
When the lights come on and they start recording
And the whole world now wants to hear your story
Tshwantse ba tsebe qho!
Nigga ke phanda mo!
Phanda mo! (x3)
Ke phanda mo!
Tshwantse ba tsebe qho!
Nigga ke phanda mo!

[Verse 2: Emtee]
Track goes out to all the Twitter thugs
Hating cause nobody real as us
Got a couple bitches in the cut
So blessed, I'm a winner cuz
Y'all lames still swagging
We the only ones dabbing
In other words killing fashion
Young and making things happen
Phanda, phanda till it hurts
From the bando to the burbs
It's a blessing and a curse
Look how they all want a verse
Ever heard of a young'un this proper?
In the ville they know me as Big Shatta
Although I'm skinny, they calling me Big Poppa
Lil nigga kick game, Chris Tucker
Me I'm never riding solo
Got goons from Limpopo
My other nigga he the [?]
Claiming you poppin bottles when it's Joko
My life is a movie, t-shirt cost 2G's
Didn't even like school, B
My closet can pay all your school fees, fuckboy

[Hook: Tshego]
When the lights come on and they start recording
And the whole world now wants to hear your story
Tshwantse ba tsebe qho!
Nigga ke phanda mo!
Phanda mo! (x3)
Ke phanda mo!
Tshwantse ba tsebe qho!
Nigga ke phanda mo!

[Verse 3: Cassper Nyovest]
Eh papa wee, sebono phap!
Ha ra tlela Jozi ho kak'
Keep the focus so I don't lose zak'
Know the city, I could show you [?]
I only hang with the niggas that I bang with
You very inconsistent, always chilling with a whole new squad
And o phela ka di loan, o swaak
I pray to God that I don't lose touch
My flow too bad
It's way out of this world, I could show you Mars
My legacy is my people, they proud
Ahead of beef, I hope it really fades out
Cause jealousy is the easy way out
No empathy to the silly players
Who carelessly hurt my name and 'em
For my pedigree is the kind not to be fucked with
Conversations is long when I'm the subject
Used to think they were on before I passed them
I used to think they were on, yeah that was past tense
Nigga I ain't here to make friends
Boy I'm here to make money (x2)
I ain't here for silly gossip motherfucker
You should get away from me (x2)
O nahana ra go foka ntja
Hao na le biti, ra o skopa ntja
Le rona re batla ho rocka ntja
And ain't nobody gonna stop us bra
Re tlile Jozi for kopantsha masentenyana
Hope I'm always in a fresh pair of Yeezy's when they got their phones out when the..

[Hook: Tshego]
When the lights come on and they start recording
And the whole world now wants to hear your story
Tshwantse ba tsebe qho!
Nigga ke phanda mo!
Phanda mo! (x3)
Ke phanda mo!
Tshwantse ba tsebe qho!
Nigga ke phanda mo!
