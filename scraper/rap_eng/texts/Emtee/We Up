From the village life, to the township
From the township, to the city life
We about to move to the ‘burbs on these niggas

Uyakhumbula mngani wami?
Besthathela phansi
Manje Basidlel' umona

'Cause we up
Sphethe icup
And we up
Basasidlel' umona
Cause we up
Sphethe icup
So we up
Basasidlel' umona


[Verse 1]
How you like me now (washa)
I see you biting now
Lames wanna fight me now
Let's get it, fede I’m down
Uthata ma chance, you kidding me?
When everyone's saying they feeling me
There’s no way I’ll let you belittle me
I don’t play in no little league
Wake up and realize that I’m really nice
And I kill the mic tryna do it right for my crew tonight
Sphuz' iSprite nabo sweetie pie

You're a fake ass, you're a hating ass, got no life

[Verse 2]
Khokha umoya, baba breathe
I’m about to release
I’m just trying to get the cheese
Take the baby mama overseas
Save money for my son’s fees
Been in the studio for some weeks
I took a walk and I got me some schnees
Throw out a life, I wanna ditch
I know I ain’t never had it easy (oh no)
Now I got some strangers tryna reach me
Been through it all, there ain’t nothing you can teach me
These voluntary bitches tryna please me
Bitches were never around
Look now I’m holding it down
I’m probably running this town
Haters ain’t making a sound
Kanti senzeni na
Ndiyazibuza mama

[Bridge]
Umtomnyama akafun' ukubon' umtomnyama eyaphambili
Umtomnyama akafun' ukubon' umtomnyama eyaphezulu

[Chorus]
Uyakhumbula mngani wami?
Besthathela phansi
Manje Basidlel' umona

'Cause we up
Sphethe icup
And we up
Basasidlel' umona
Cause we up
Sphethe icup
So we up
Basasidlel' umona
