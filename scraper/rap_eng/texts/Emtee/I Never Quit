[Hook - EMTee]
They tryna do it like I did it that's a wish
I'm going hard everyday I never quit
And I ain't playing man I'm really 'bout this shit
All I ever did was hustle hard and make the hits
Now, watch me ball out like B-ball teams
Watch me pop up on your screens
While we rocking religion jeans

[Verse 1 - Sequel]
We pull up wavy on the scene
Making dream work with my team
We roll up, smoke up, they ain't believe
Nowadays I'm ballin', ballin', ballin' on the scene
Green tings in a baggy
Fantasize about a caddy
Been fighting for my earnings
Do this shit for my baby

Feel me when I'm in the building

Get my daily dose of victory
Show me love when you see me

We drop the pennies down
We got it figured out, we got your mammies now

[Hook - EMTee]
They tryna do it like I did it that's a wish
I'm going hard everyday I never quit
And I ain't playing man I'm really 'bout this shit
All I ever did was hustle hard and make the hits
Now, watch me ball out like B-ball teams
Watch me pop up on your screens
While we rocking religion jeans
