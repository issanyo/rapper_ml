Chillin' at the bando

[Verse 1: Gemini Major]
Early in the morning trap
If you can dwadla just make it happen
Me and my niggas up to something
Blowing money like it's nothing
Yeah, I got shooters don't you mess with my dawgs
If you play me then I'm taking your hoe
I'ma badmon like I told you before
Big tings a gwan and I keep on the low
Badmon, wagwan?
North God pull up with the bad ones
Looking for a fire then we got one
Private movies with detentions
She want the whole thing
She looking like more thing
I bounce your gold ring
Then I pass someone a double D
Skrrr

[Verse 2: Emtee]
Trapping out the house with the bolts on the window
Got my nigga Gemini rolling out the endo
Got it from a plug out in Hillbrow
And I got a rich mommy she a bimbo
And as'dlali lana ntwana, skhand' isaka
Fak' impama if you mess with my dawgs
Singazo khohlwisana baba la siyaspana
Fak' izaka I'm just letting you know
Catch me chilling with your bae
Mina I don't really drink
She taking shots to the brain
Found me rolling up the thing
Young nigga, young nigga
Yini ngathi ley' ntwana zine nkinga
Vela mina ng'vele ng'shaye istina
She came to witness the funk, wang'nika

[Verse 3: Frank Casino]
Too many girls in the house tonight
Looking for a vibe
All of up on my case
I swear it's like a trial
Ring, ring, ring
I don't never dial
I know it's been a while
I don't never call you
Ain't nobody I know that can call you
And they tell you it's Franky C and Gemini-ih
Always start a rumor let me tell it so I make it clear
Yah-yah
Badmon, see they throwing shots like barman
Too busy smoking on the bar man
Always on them trees like Tarzan
Yah-man
I know you seen the squado
All my niggas in the cut-o
All we ever do is cut-o
All up in the bando with the benzo, woh
