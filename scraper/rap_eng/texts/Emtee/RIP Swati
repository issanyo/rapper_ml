[Chorus]
We don't live forever
Like every other thing in this world
We come and go
No forever
But its worth it
It may never be perfect
Make every minute count, before they take you out
Make all your people proud before its lights out

[Verse 1]
I get high enough to be up there with you
Still in denial i don't wanna know if its true
Akunyamezeki, I been trying to get it I mean
That day in hospital uthe I'll see you soon
And Ive been trying piece it together and keep it inside me
Ang'understandi na
And you know maybe ngisazovuka and still dream
Mangvala amehlo ami, You are all I see

[Pre-Chorus]
We will all leave this world
We will all leave this world
We will all leave this world
We will all leave this world
Yeah

[Chorus]
We don't live forever
Like every other thing in this world
We come and go
No forever
But its worth it
It may never be perfect
Make every minute count, before they take you out
Make all your people proud before its lights out

[Verse 2]
Kulungile baba
Makuyintando yakho
Is'fiso sakho
Singobani thina, esingaphikisana ne'nhlelo zakho
Ngoba nalomphefumulo owakho
Nalendodana oyithathile eyakho

[Pre-Chorus]
We will all leave this world
We will all leave this world
We will all leave this world
We will all leave this world

[Chorus]
We don't live forever
Like every other thing in this world
We come and go
No forever
But its worth it
It may never be perfect
Make every minute count, before they take you out
Make all your people proud, before its lights out

[Outro]
UMama wayesitsho mihla yonke
Kufanele siguqe sithandaze
Forgive your brother manixhabane
Let nothing come between us masihlangane
You told me I should kill em, that's exactly what I did
Thanks for putting me on
I had to write this song

[Pre-Chorus]
We will all leave this world
We will all leave this world
We will all leave this world
We will all leave this world

[Chorus]
We don't live forever
Like every other thing in this world
We come and go
No forever
But its worth it
It may never be perfect
Make every minute count, before they take you out
Make all your people proud, before its lights out
