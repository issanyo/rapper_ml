[Chorus]
I tell the DJ bring that shit back
I remember when they used to say my shit wack
Now I pull up on em with a big stack
I never boast through the most that's a big fact
Yall still in a zig zag, 808's in the hood yeah I did that
Never took a break like Kit-Kat
They still talking shit give em a tic-tac
Tell the DJ bring that shit back

[Verse 1]
Ok what happened to rap, don't ask me
[?] ekasi [?] trap, yeah that's me
[?] Emtee
Now all they do is cap when they talk about me
Ok, I live in the 'burbs, [?] lekasi
Fuck what you heard [?]
I be with the posse, blomming [?]
[?]
Hell naw, don't do it, I see many many men go through it
I told em I'ma make it, they all knew it
I told the DJ bring it back
Watch the crowd go stupid

[Chorus]
I tell the DJ bring that shit back
I remember when they used to say my shit wack
Now I pull up on em with a big stack
I never boast through the most that's a big fact
Yall still in a zig zag, 808's in the hood yeah I did that
Never took a break like Kit-Kat
They still talking shit give em a tic-tac
Tell the DJ bring that shit back

[Verse 2]
Man I had to grow up, ever since the blow up
I done got my dough up, lemme switch the flow up
I'm in it, to win it, no limit, we flex
I'm living, it's giving, we splitting the cheque
I'ma do it bigger than I did it before
I don't do this for a hoe, I'm doing this for the dough
I'm trynna kill every show, always switch up the flow
Living life to it's fullest, I'm not taking it slow
I gotta get the bag straight cash, hit the cash, where it's at
I was broke way back, this year is pay back
Noboby was doing shit till we came in
Now these rappers bribing DJ's to play them

[Chorus]
I tell the DJ bring that shit back
I remember when they used to say my shit wack
Now I pull up on em with a big stack
I never boast through the most that's a big fact
Yall still in a zig zag, 808's in the hood yeah I did that
Never took a break like Kit-Kat
They still talking shit give em a tic-tac
Tell the DJ bring that shit back
