[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Don't have to go to the movies
We can get up to whatever
At the crib we can order the sushi
I wanna know you a lil better
I got jets on decks
You know that I'm the best, no flex
I got jets on deck, You know that I'm the best, no flex
Ngihlale ngipheth' jet on deck
I don't wanna stress, only progress, more cheques

[Verse 1]
I ain't even with the crew
I just wanna be with you
I don't be out in Taboo, steady balling like a fool
Been loving you since school
This blunt can get you in the mood
Ke kopa o ntshune tuu
You're my baby you're my boo
We be dabbing we so cool
I'ma have you screaming like ooh
Then we order fast food
Girl I love you times two yeah
Asina stress thina  coz we be at the crib
I know these bitches hate you coz they know you my chick
Look at them change they faces when they see how we live
You and a blunt by my side, I'm getting lit
You on the left side while I'm pressing the whip
You roll up the dro, I'ma pour up the four and sip

[Chorus]
Don't have to go to the movies
We can get up to whatever
At the crib we can order the sushi
I wanna know you a lil better
I got Jets on deck, You know that I'm the best, no flex
I got Jets on deck, You know that I'm the best, no flex
Jets on deck, I don't wanna stress, only progress, more cheques

[Verse 2]
I remember back in school, I was so confused
I didn't know what to do, decided I'm sticking to you like glue
Come with me my boo, nobody like you
And I'm trynna wife you, I wanna hear you say 'I do'
Baya'sizonda, we winning , Sebe'nomona we living
I got the bey and the jay everyday in the cut, in Versace linen
They still dream about it, we did it
Cooling and run round the city
I jump out the [?] then hit the road, I'm close vuka ke sweedy
I just came from the plug
We can spark it up and make love
She know whats up, I was born in the dust

[Chorus]
Don't have to go to the movies
We can get up to whatever
At the crib we can order the sushi
I wanna know you a lil better
I got Jets on deck, You know that I'm the best, no flex
I got Jets on deck, You know that I'm the best, no flex
Jets on deck, I don't wanna stress, only progress, more cheques
