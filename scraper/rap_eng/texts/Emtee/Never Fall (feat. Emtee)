Hook

I'll never fall
You can put me on the bench
I'm still gonna ball
I'll never fall
You can put me on the bench
I'm still gonna ball

Kudala befun' ungiwisa hah
Hayike bafana niya wish-a hah
Bazamile ungicisha hah
Siyabangena ziyakhipha hah
Many men, many many men
Wish death on me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more

Verse 1
Soon as I wake up, get the bag
Pockets full of cash and my pants stay sagged
Big body black bag, wolf full of gas
If you ain't gang then you can't hang
Learned from my mistakes, moved right along
They don't know my mixtapes, album passed gold
Platinum on a big cake, we just want some
Hunnid plus kick game, journey's too long
Let's geddit, let's geddit
I don't think we have much left widdit
We did it, we did it
Living in abog crib now you wanna visit

Verse 2
Pull up to the spot now they lookin' at me
I am not a rat but you know i got cheese
If you show respect my nigga you a G
Always been a rumour how they wanna rob me
They did not, ba sa bandisa
I can make you get and shapa manyisa
Mina ngisabelile maigama libizwa
Zam' uk'akha bona bayadiliza
Just know I work hard for this, and I
Gotta thank God for this, and I
Remember not having confidence
I'm strapped, just for the ?
