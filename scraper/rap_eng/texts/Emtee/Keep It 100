[Chorus]
Keep it one hundred with yourself
You feel the pressure seeing Gucci on my belt
Ey
Khok'umoya khok'umoya s'bali woah
It's a lot of things niggas don't know
That whip ain't really your whip
That bitch ain't really your bitch
You capping you think you slick
Them boys ain't really your clique
That whip ain't really your whip
That bitch ain't really your bitch
You capping you think you slick
Them boys ain't really your clique

[Verse 1]
Them Yeezy's ain't really real
How you gon diss me thinking I care how you feel
These niggas know that this trapping shit is a skill
I can and I will, it's God's will, it doesn't stop here
Vele ngiqale k’dal, ukujuta nokus’thusa kungashuba maseng’phet vele lez’ezam
Noba beng’ngenzani
Got some shooters and ngipheth amapantsula
Apheth’iydudla suk’endleleni yam
Wit your fugeyzi ass
Just pay me back
Even though I'm selling plat'
I still want the bag
I keep it real with myself, don't need you to do that
You buying face pumping gas, my nigga just voetsek
Just re-up on full tank l could son a student
Business booming, get the loot
And keep it moving then I'm cooling
Nigga don't lie to me, you don't ride with me
Tell people that you know just to shine with me

[Chorus]
Keep it one hundred with yourself
You feel the pressure seeing Gucci on my belt
Ey
Khok'umoya khok'umoya s'bali woah
It's a lot of things niggas don't know
That whip ain't really your whip
That bitch ain't really your bitch
You capping you think you slick
Them boys ain't really your clique
That whip ain't really your whip
That bitch ain't really your bitch
You capping you think you slick
Them boys ain't really your clique

[Verse 2]
Your louboutins ain't really real
Your rollie fake your girl fugeyzi
I'm offended if you trynna be like me
Don't waste your time copying me
Even nami nje ang’sazi how I does it
It's just how God wants it to be
And she ain't really yours
I own her heart and her drawers
I'ma player cheeseboy mokoena yeah for sure
Mang’ced uknyoba cheeseboy pass it to my dogs
We came from the mud edustini give a fuck about
Ukuthi uyang’thanda na
Ukuthi ung’thatha kanjani
Ukuthi who ain’t famous k’yena, uthi kangakanani
Cabanga ok’cabangayo
Baningi abanejealous ngam, abanomona
I'm sorry this is idestiny yam
Uthand’ ungathandi mara usazonghlonipha
I'm not mad you wanna beat us up
You can never be I'm just saying ningas’tshela man

[Chorus]
Keep it one hundred with yourself
You feel the pressure seeing Gucci on my belt
Ey
Khok'umoya khok'umoya s'bali woah
It's a lot of things niggas don't know
That whip ain't really your whip
That bitch ain't really your bitch
You capping you think you slick
Them boys ain't really your clique
That whip ain't really your whip
That bitch ain't really your bitch
You capping you think you slick
Them boys ain't really your clique
