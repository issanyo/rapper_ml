See I need no stress
I just wanna party
Good things coming my way
Homie I am blessed
Know I am living in the hard days
Say kuzo lunga manje
Need no stress, stress, stress
Life can be a mess, I know
See you can be the best
Yes, there's no time to waste nah

Excuse the swag
I never brag coz I never had nothing
I choose my fam and who I am but I was made for something
Even when am rich
I'll help others instead of stunting
I wish I can change the world and the [?]
I'm not really a rapper I just make nice music
To inspire you lames coz you might use it
Now I'm working with the best
Hit that range for the stress
Catch a fade, reminisce
Never fake I'm legit
Phambili phambili, se bulele industry'n[?]
Lape imakhaya blazini [?]
Siya phambili a e jiki [?]
[?]
Vele [?]
Mina le magang [?]

See I need no stress
I just wanna party
Good things coming my way
Homie I am blessed
Know I am living in the hard days
Say kuzo lunga manje
Need no stress, stress, stress
Life can be a mess, I know
See you can be the best
Yes, there's no time to waste nah

Play my song let them hear it through the Jukebox
Get the money do to me and tell me when the boost stop
Claiming you the shit, you got to pay me or poop blocks
Never underground boy am smoking on the roof top
They thought am kidding now they got their heads in the ceiling
Funny how things changed
Lame stressing they feelings
Like I gave a damn boy am chilling
Boast up till am winning
Lord protect me from these women who envy the life I am living
They love they yapping, mara a baentse fokol
Ke a zama zama nami [?]sokol
So they wanna see me fall
They don't wanna see me ball
They just wanna see me flop
Now they wanna be cuz

See I need no stress
I just wanna party
Good things coming my way
Homie I am blessed
Know I am living in the hard days
Say kuzo lunga manje
Need no stress, stress, stress
Life can be a mess, I know
See you can be the best
Yes, there's no time to waste nah
