[Intro: Nasty C]
Believe me
Believe me
Believe me

[Pre-hook: Nasty C]
We got some hoes that dress like nurses
They all getting freaky
I like it down on a Tuesday
Can't wait for the weekend
She smashed all the homies in one night
I hope she don't tweet it
Pool full of liquor, that happens when you're in the deep end

[Hook: Emtee]
No foreplay, just give me
It's so amazing how they willing
Ask me why, are you kidding?
We some young niggas winning
We some young niggas winning
We some young niggas winning
Ask me why, are you kidding?
We some young niggas winning

[Verse 1: Nasty C]
If I don't inspire you
I might fuck around and retire you
Funny thing is I'm not even trying to
If I was you, I'd let the towel loose
Man y'all just got no luck
Y'all don't got no juice, nothing to roll up
Me and Emtee emptied out a clip on these grown ups
Man, and this shit was overnight
Didn't even get to record it right
This ain't no regular shit, this ain't no Rigby and Mordecai
This is that do it first, then leave 'em a trail
Anything to even the scales
We did this shit straight from Cantare
You know what comes after an evening in hell
The kid is beyond rap
Never slipping, won't fall in no contract
I told you I'm street, I'm so tarmac
Just tryna get me some palms scratched
Just tryna get me some hella crumbs
Do some things that were never done
I hear you're picking sides
Man, mine is the better one
Mine is the better one, trust and believe in the kids
I swear that we got it
Tucked the summer right into my pants
I don't even have to hide it
Nowadays girls just get on their knees
And they tell me to potty
Man you gotta pay me respect my nigga
Cheque or deposit

[Verse 2: Emtee]
Vele vele we in it
Simthebelele we livin'
S'bathole ba lele with it
Now we out here, finna get it
Y'all pay to visit (dankie)
I'm from Matatiele running Jozi
Don't be a fool acting like you know me
Don't call me "brody"
We came out sipping a 40, they used to ignore me
Look how he's changed
Look how they all wanna pay me
No longer calling me crazy
Would starve on a daily
But a young nigga was praying
Now I'm about to go Super Saiyan
Switch up the flow, speed up the dough
Re-up the purp, sweetheart you know
We bout to blow, they kid us
You know I fill up iJo'
S'funa le mali ngoba k'dala siphila si broke
Yeah, how about now?
Ho monate C
Who run shit? Me and Nasty C
Amakipkip dropped me a new T
K'khali iRoll Up na se ma kishini
Knock knock, who's there?
An Asian with a new pair
I rock it, you stare
Swag game too rare
