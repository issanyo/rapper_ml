Yeah it's the movement
Atm
Ey

[Chorus]
Phuma ekasi yeah ku-rough where I'm from
If they pull up on you better give em what they want
Quick two fingers for you niggas getting jumped
I see you flexing boy be careful with when you stunt
Next thing you know your bitch gone
Your wrist is gone
Your whip gone
Everything just gone
Your wrist gone
Your whip gone
Everything just gone

[Verse 1]
They said I'm buying the mall
Fuck em I pray to the Lord
I ain't riding in a Ford
Hell naw I'm not broke
Atm is my Forbes, I'm moving up of course
Shelltoe or airforce scoop me at the airport
Emtee tha hustler ukuphi naaaaaa
Eintlik zishaphi masuthule kangaka
Mel'khiphe something kulonyaka
Lezi ziyadlala futhi ziya chancer
See I'm from a dangerous place, you snitch and they go in the case
Stop rapping bout me pussy nigga come say it to my face
Manando will do you for me, you niggas know around the streets
You heard me killing these beats, I'm in the stu' for weeks
I know some killers, I know some villians
I know the [?] at the church
If uyayidinga
I know some dealers them niggas putting in work
Walala wasala, nix for mahala
I came from the gutter where they talk and never stutter
Yeah

[Chorus]
Puma ekasi yeah ku-rough where I'm from
If they pull up on you better give em what they want
Quick two fingers for you niggas getting jumped
I see you flexing boy be careful when you stunt
Next thing you know your bitch gone
Your wrist is gone
Your whip gone
Everything just gone
Your wrist gone
Your whip gone
Everything just gone

[Verse 2]
They show me love in your city, ngapha they robbing you
You busy claiming that gangsta my nigga we mobbing too
And I'm a ghetto hero, I'm talking Robin Hood
And we some goodfellas sondela ungasabi boo

Come hang with the gang tell your boyfriend that you see him later

Ulelo thixo cause now I'm living different
Me and my soldiers we been always on a mission
Was really hungry now I got a fancy kitchen
This my life [?] how it started back in [?]
I know my songs is soulfull
Man I had no place to go to

[Chorus]
Puma ekasi yeah Ku-rough where I'm from
If they pull up on you better give em what they want
Quick two fingers for you niggas getting jumped
I see you flexing boy be careful when you stunt
Next thing you know your bitch gone
Your wrist is gone

Everything just gone
Your wrist gone
Your whip gone
Everything just gone
