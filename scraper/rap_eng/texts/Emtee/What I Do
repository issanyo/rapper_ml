[Verse 1]
Since I was nine always knew that I would shine
Wasn't loyal to no dime, I was loyal to the grind
Used to sit and hurt inside, as I'm watching time fly
Had the apple of my eye, motivated every time
I was going out my mind, in the stu' every night
Nigga all I make is hits so I had no hit to find
Didn't see the money [?] blind
Kept a flying focus, I could see the signs
I'm still ducking slimes, never did no crime
Up the ladder I'ma climb, I’m cutting off the slime
They thought I was stupid bitch I’m paid by these rhymes
So I heard they wanna murk me, I move to the other side

[Chorus]
What I do to these niggas
They got something to say
While I'm lighting up a j, I’m not practicing no hate
What I do to these niggas
Abafuni [?] grand
I don't think they understand
Lil nigga I've been the man

Light up the flex [?]

Black hard working brother
Ey
I've been lit yeah since I was a kid yeah
Since I was six I’ve been dreaming big yeah
Couldn't wait to be a boss in the mix yeah
Look me now exactly what it is yeah
I just had a big year and I'm dropping this year
Look at all my peers yeah, sipping all this beer
They got envy they might kill em, had to dissapear
Problems getting bigger yeah, they wanna see me in jail yeah
Atm living well
We run the city yeah, careful what you wish for
Coz you just might get it yeah
Rolling up a zip yeah elevation trip yeah
[?] at the crib yeah, diamonds on me [?]

[Chorus]
What I do to these niggas
They got something to say
While I'm lighting up a j, I'm not practicing no hate
What I do to these niggas
