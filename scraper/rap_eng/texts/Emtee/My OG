[Chorus]
My OG told me murder everything
If they tripping homie let it bang
Uzoz' umoya like I'm Heavy K
Them bitches love me like I'm danny K

I run the city, 50 niggas with me
You don't want no problems, voetsek, hamba kini
Hamba Kini
Tsek hamba kini
Ungjwayel' amasimba ungbheke kahle angsiyikhimbhi
Hamba Kini
Hamba kini
Voetsek hamba kini[Ã—2]
Ungjwayel' amasimba ungbheke kahle angsiyikhimbhi
[Verse 1]
I've been working hard for this shit
And I thank God for this shit
Working grave yard for the bricks
100 racks straight on my wrist
I don't spend none on a bitch
Everybody know that's a risk
If you got a problem, we gon fix
Chains come in two's like the chop sticks
Catch me smoking in the whip
If they catch me I'm in shit
Gotta skrrrr to the crib
Yeah I get it how I live
Got that sprite, I'ma mix
Drop some ice then I sip
ATM yall should get with this shit
Thy know I be [?], expensive like Pogba
Now my money got the zero's and the commas
She said she wanna meet the squad with her chommas
What you sipping I got Moet and some pongratz

[Chorus]
My OG told me murder everything
If they tripping homie let it bang

[Verse 2]
Gotta thank yall for this shit
You the reason I ball in this bitch
Been around the world taking trips
Always got that purp taking sips
Yeah you the one that turned into a snitch
Now you mad about my sitch
Now you sadder than a bitch
That I might drop a Louis bag on your bitch
Julle praat te veel, I'm getting dough for real
I won't give you free shit, maybe Oprah will
If you talking money, we can close the deal
Damn these nigga's hating but it's over still
Yeah
I pull up, hop out, whole hood they pop out
Louis, Gucci 'sace, that's a knock out
More money than [?]

Goons here with they Glock out
They slap you and you pass out

[Chorus]
My OG told me murder everything
If they tripping homie let it bang
