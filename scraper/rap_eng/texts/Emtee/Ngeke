[Chorus – Emtee]
I strictly came here for damage
Y’all already know (You already know!)
Most of these lames is acting (Woo!)
Got nothing to show (Ain’t nothing to show!)
Don’t stress me my n1gga (No!)
All them things you do
Don’t impress me my n1gga (oh no!)

[Hook :EMTEE ]
Angeke nilunge bafana bam
Tshela mina ukuth’ ukhalangan

Angeke nilunge bafana bam
Tshela mina ukuth’ ukhalangan

Angeke nilunge bafana bam
Tshela mina ukuth’ ukhalangan

[Verse 1 – Emtee]
Kwangena istingo ngempela (washa)
Bathi umntwana to hela
All I know is benghlupheka
Flow game wothukela
Ngiphetha my package
They never average
And you, I know you bragging
You just a has-been
Phela mina
Ngimnandi ngeskill
Manje siyaphila ungaphaphe kaslam uzoztholu sufile
Kuzonke ready to kill
Tell me how you feel
Keeping it real
I won't forget all the people that hated and put me down
I guess it’s true when they say what goes around comes around
So came up from nothing, some n1ggas was fronting
Survived all the bullsh1t, I really be hustling
I do no coughing, I’m about the bopping
You can’t tell me nothing, I still get to busting
Trust me, In no time I be winning
I got the ambition.bitch i'm on a mission
One time for the people that listen
Hopped in the studio, that is my kitchen
Ngeke nenze nex bafana bami sazogcwala ngam ang’si takalan’
I do it big!
Shout out my mama, look what you did!

[Chorus – Emtee]
I strictly came here for damage
Y’all already know (You already know!)
Most of these lames is acting (Woo!)
Got nothing to show (Ain’t nothing to show!)
Don’t stress me my n1gga (No!)
All them things you do
Don’t impress me my n1gga (oh no!)

[Hook :EMTEE ]
Angeke nilunge bafana bam
Tshela mina ukuth’ ukhalangan

Angeke nilunge bafana bam
Tshela mina ukuth’ ukhalangan

Angeke nilunge bafana bam
Tshela mina ukuth’ ukhalangan


[Verse 2: Fifi Cooper]
So you know the real deal
It’s such a big deal
Gozama go spana when they all act like they don’t feel you
They don’t need you, and they don’t want you
They hating all because they all wish they gotta be you
Ba batla go zama go rapper go thwana le enna ga kwala and for sure ba thloka le tsona di thlakala tsona (?)……
But now I won't forget all the people that hated and put me down
I guess its true when they say what goes around comes around
Ngeke ulunge mfana no matter the time or the weather
Whatever you do just know that Fifi Cooper can do it better

[OUTRO-HOOK : Emtee]

Angeke nilunge bafana bam
Tshela mina ukuth’ ukhalangan

Angeke nilunge bafana bam
Tshela mina ukuth’ ukhalangan
