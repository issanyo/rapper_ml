[Verse 1]
Mama told me that I should pray before I go to sleep
But I found myself praying for my enemy
We stick around hoping they change though
After the rain comes a rainbow, and they trip when you say no
Even when they know, you go high, life in the streets so high
They hate when you need no one, I don't see no one
Coz Me and my team go high, they sipping on lean so high
Baba God He there for my side
This thing I do that's changing my life the change in my life
Everything it seems to go right
Never had nothing man I would cry

Oh I mean, can't you see that I need, to feed family urgently
[?]
Make some g's
And now I ball till the cops come
Ngena e'kasi lam, A.U for izinja zam'
Le banyana ba re etla kwan'
She trynna duck I bombaclot man

[Pre-Chorus]
The wanna know now where I live what I sip and where I been
How it goes down, I wasn't g, now everybody wanna take pics
I'm sorry yeah see the Lord had different plans for me yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Nawe bambelela

[Verse 2]
They don't treat me the same no more
I don't ask but they open door
I don't care what they say no more
I'm getting paid, it's a blessing for sure
My family pray for me, I hope your's do too
Noma kubanda, noma kushushu
Imithandazo yam', ingivikele zitheni I see no Voodoo


They said they win, I don't believe it

Papa God He there for my side
All these fans they changing my life
Its coming together man I won't lie
Poverty I'm saying bye bye

Oh I see they chose me, meant to be, can't you see, now I'm free
Blowing trees over seas, double g's and Supreme
You probably thinking I'ma asshole
But you wasn't with me struggling hustling in the trap though
Tell me what you mad for

What you think I rap for

[Pre-Chorus]
The wanna know now where I live what I sip and where I been
How it goes down, I wasn't g, now everybody wanna take pics
I'm sorry yeah see the Lord had different plans for me yeah yeah

[Chorus]
