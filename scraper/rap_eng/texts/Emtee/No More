[Chorus]
No crying no more
Yeah ah
Tula mama tula mama
No dying no more
Tula mama Tula mama
Don't wanna struggle no more
Yeah ah
Don't wanna suffer no more
No I don't wanna
Don't wanna do this no more
No more, no more,  no more

[Verse 1]
Stabs in the back no shacks in the trap
Smash and grabs our mothers getting jacked
Young nigga selling that crack for the cash
Homeless people eating out of the trash
USatan uchitha amakhaya
Abantwana bayafa yindlala
Abanye baphila ngokuganga
'Bazali bahlala bekhala
Kanti ngubani ozosincwaba na
Andisathandi ukubona umakhelwane elila
Iphupho lam kukusibona sonke siphila
Bring peace to the streets, be the hero I wanna be and keep it g
See the streets is me so the sneaks is key and my peeps with me
I don't wanna beg no more
Get stopped by the feds no more
On my mama I stay low low
Think I'll lose this bread no no
Everyday we lose brothers to the crime
Feel like we wasting our time, no one hears us when we cry

[Chorus]
No crying no more
Yeah ah
Tula mama tula mama
No dying no more
Yeah ah
Tula mama Tula mama
Don't wanna struggle no more
Yeah ah
Don't wanna suffer no more
Don't wanna do this no more
No more no more no more

[Verse 2]
Mara why siphila soh
The other day they shot the homie at the store
These cowards beating women some more
If she your girl then tell me what you hit her for
Told her sister never tell on what you saw
She don't keep friends no more
Coz he do what he do and just go
Impilo irough
Enough is enough yeah
Let us unite yeah
All we got is us yeah
My nigga trust me
We gon be up
Non believers, they gon see us
Yaz' impilo ayikho fair
Buza mina I've been there
Out the hood seng'hlala le
We link up masihlangane
Feels like in schools they should make 'peace' a subject
Been telling folks, there ain't no need to be upset

[Chorus]
No crying no more
Yeah ah
Tula mama tula mama
No dying no more
Yeah ah
Tula mama Tula mama
Don't wanna struggle no more
Yeah ah
Don't wanna suffer no more
No I don't wanna
Don't wanna do this no more
No more no more
