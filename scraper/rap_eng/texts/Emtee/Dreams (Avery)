[Verse 1]
Gijimis'imali namagenge
Won't be broke forever hhay ngeke
U didn't believe in me
Now u're bout to see
I'm moving up wen'usele
IWheel liyajika ya vele
And angeke ning'mele
Tjel' amahater asiyeke
Bangamane bas'bheke
Bheka la mfanakithi
If u're hating on me... Sorry
Ngzok'dlel' umntanakini
And another thing
I am a boss, bayangazi emphakathini
Ditch a hoe, kill a show lethi mali kim
I'll never stop, hell no coz I'm gonna win
I'm in the building but I'm still goin in
I'm tryna KO lames gettin ready for jeans
I see u talkin but u ain't saying nothing
I'm rollin with ballers and you lames stay stunting
Two bitches, one night
Yall stay cuffin
Kill a show at the club and u know its straight jumpin
Met PRO just the other day
And my dream came true, watchu wanna say?
Had my team on set poppin hella A's
We don't let any mamasita seeing other lads

[Hook]
I came up knowing that if I don't give up, then I might get something
If I quit then I won't get none
I'll admit the struggle is no fun [x2]
Dreams do come true
You can win if you want to [x4]

[Verse 2]

[?]
Hale kishebile bam'bitsa kamabitso
Bakwala minyako bangitsepisa lidintso
Now I send money to the family
Go for any mommy who can get it
All the way to the bank; nigga I'm dabbin
Run up on em niggas its tragic
Now I'm tryna make news vanish
One song got me livin in the burbs
None wrong with u sippin on purps
Pull up in the kasi with a whip like skurt
They all know this is what I deserve
Came from the bottom; that's where they want me at
Look now I'm runnin laps
Try makin hits; fuck all ur phony raps
We're makin money tracks
Yes Sir, we want them stacks
Stack it and stack it and give away ol the racks
But ya'll niggas ain't real
Ya ain't payin no bill
All u do is talk about yay
U don't own no bill
To the thugs tryna spazz out
They gon meet me at the trap house
U the one who knows what that's bout
Wheepin all the birds out
I be chill in the track through the talkin
I enjoy watchin niggas try jokin
Look at them forcing
This niggas should forfeit
We running Jozi

[Hook]

I came up knowing that if I don't give up, then I might get something
If I quit then I won't get none
I'll admit the struggle is no fun [x2]
Dreams do come true
You can win if you want to [x8]
