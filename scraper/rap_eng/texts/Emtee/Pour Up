Yeah
They already know what time it is
What I do

[Chorus]
I pour a pint in a soda
Feel everything slow up
Double cup every time I show up
Even in the club I'm poured up
No I'm not sober
Couldn't wait to be a grown up
Just so I can pour up

[Verse 1]
Cups is in two or three
Like Tunechi
I'm cooling, they losing
[?]
[?], too high
[?]
[?], shooter, shooter
[?]
You ain't down to earth me I'm too high
[?]
[?]
I'm just too numb
I be in the cut with my two cups
In the back of the room, just to watch
She said I'm not gonna make it and
Just you watch, while I...

[Chorus]
I pour a pint in a soda
Feel everything slow up
Double cup every time I show up
Even in the club I'm poured up
No I'm not sober
Couldn't wait to be a grown up
Just so I can pour up

[Verse 2]
I remember back in the day
I was wack and ashamed
Holding back with the tape
Trap wasn't safe, rats at my place, with a gat to my face
Sipping ac so that the pain go away
Mix it up with the Mary Jane
I only need purple rain
Since a youngin I been praying

I can't take this pain no more
I'm too young, I'm too young
I done got this faith so numb
I'm too numb, I'm too numb

[Chorus]
I pour a pint in a soda
Feel everything slow up
Double cup every time I show up
Even in the club I'm poured up
No I'm not sober
Couldn't wait to be a grown up
Just so I can pour up
