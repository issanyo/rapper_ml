[Intro]
Boy that moola swole
(Ya, you dunno)
ATM nigga , ATM nigga
(ey man, yeah what they say)
Flex

[Verse 1]
I just went Platinum
The boy's on top ain't no catching him
Did it coz I'm passionate
And I put a lot action in
My people dying in em shacks in there
You want me to help you, don't see that happening
They don't want us to own cribs coz we trap in em
White tee like them folks with the [?]
Young nigga from the Jozi Streets
All my songs is on repeat
Pay up if you owe me please
We go loco [?] on the beat
We pull up and disturb the peace
Heard you got beef, Yeah I want a piece
Stop talking boy, I'm rolling cheese
How you hating, you a solo tweet
Shout out to niggas left me in the cold
Joburg City hella stories untold
I told myself that I would never fold
Been doing this since 9 years old

[Chorus]
(I just went Platinum)
(I ain't even playing with these boys
Everything real
Everything rags to riches
The hoes are back, everything)
(I just went Platinum)

I pull up and got a 8:45 on em
Pussy niggas that's what I call em
I just went and got a piece I'm bout to slide for em
And watch their mamma cry for em

(Just don't be pushing a young nigga
Not no gangsta or nothing but I can take it)
(I just went Platinum)
(I just went Platinum)
(I just went Platinum)
(I just went Platinum)
(I just went Platinum)

[Verse 2]
I just landed from Europe
Came back now we planning a tour
My chains is real to the core
I'ma do it like I did it before
Nigga's know I'm the one
I face problems never run
'sace for my son
And I'm probably on a blunt
They know I hold it down, I keep it steady
I see them haters frown, they look so petty
Bitch I am no clown don't try to play me
I was out in London town I hope you get me
Same lame from a village, now I'm worth a couple millies
If you coming to my city, better see me or you gon get it
I still do it like I'm broke, slap myself with diamond chokes
I told you I'm ATM, please don't ask me about them folks
I still get it on the low, pot is heated on the stove
Should I drop this album they say what you waiting for

[Outro]
(Yeah what you waiting for man)
(I just went Platinum)
(Do your thing)
(I just went Platinum)
(Yeah)
(I just went Platinum)
(I just went Platinum)
(I just went Platinum)
(I just went Platinum)
