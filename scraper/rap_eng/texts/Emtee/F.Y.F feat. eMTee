Verse 1 [Seth Singer]

I'm on the run and I'm doing my thing
Money on my mind so I keep on grinding
This sexy girl got a thing for the kid
She caught me outta guard but I'm willing to f**kfor  her

My boys told me she's a runaway girl
Can't resist all the booty that she has
And she feeds me, yeah she f**ks the kid
Think she loves me but she's not here to stay
