Yinja yam' u-Sliqe

[Chorus - Makwa]
Lent oy'yenzayo ey, ay'lunganga
Lent oy'yenzayo ey, ay'lunganga
Lent oy'yenzayo ey, ay'lunganga
Lent oy'yenzayo ey, ay'lunganga

[Verse 1 - Makwa]
Me and my niggas we've been fighting that good fight
Each and everywhere, dreaming 'bout the goods life
You want the truth? I forget about the juice right
This is do or die, these are cruel times
I want a whip that's foreign, I want a chick that's foreign
Money I came here for it
Some things I just can't afford them
What's a nigga gotta do for chelete?
What's a nigga gotta do? Ya, ngiyabuza
They will suck you and they'll leave you out to dry
Kawasaki ntwana yam', impilo i-fast
Abazali bami abaphila ngami
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus - Makwa]
Lent oy'yenzayo ey, ay'lunganga
Lent oy'yenzayo ey, ay'lunganga
Lent oy'yenzayo ey, ay'lunganga
Lent oy'yenzayo ey, ay'lunganga

[Verse 2 - Emtee]
ATM
I came up, way up
I was broke but now a nigga paid up
Wait up
Before performing gotta say a prayer to my maker
Then roll this jamaica
Then get straight to the paper, yeah
K'dala s'gudla, k'dala s'phusha, can't nobody hold me back
Sgela siyadura, had no tutor, I was living in the trap
Now I'm clued up, swag is brutal and I've never been a rat
I don't do no Remy Martin coz my name ain't Pam
True Religion on the jeans, ay
Getting money and it's clean, ay
Got a family to feed, ay
Can't be living on the screen, ay
Gotta get it, gotta eat, ay
Got a girl I don't keep, ay
I don't rest or sleep, ay
They sleep on me, ay

[Chorus - Makwa]
Lent oy'yenzayo ey, ay'lunganga
Lent oy'yenzayo ey, ay'lunganga
Lent oy'yenzayo ey, ay'lunganga
Lent oy'yenzayo ey, ay'lunganga

[Verse 3 - Maraza]
Weh mthakathi what you sayin' to me now?
See I drew the game to me now
I got the sauce that all these lames couldn't find
Turned your daughter to a lames groupie now
Phela k'dala ngi hlu, hlupheka
Djwanong chelete 'ya atumela
Futh' ak'loko ngi thuthumela
Mangiy'bona ngiyay'dudumela
Ng'phuma ng'phethe iskeem sama perekis'
Ng'khule ngidl' u-sardine nama shebenis'
All my niggas write hits, never try this
We might leave you lifeless where the mic is
I came from nothing they was looking at me like who are you?
Dropped a hit, it was lit
Bonke bathula tu
Lent' oy'rappayo, ay'vuthwanga
Mina le ngiy'felayo, yeah
Ifunz' u-Mama
