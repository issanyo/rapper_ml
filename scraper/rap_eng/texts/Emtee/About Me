[Chorus]
Ngiyazi ukuth awujabuli mawungibona ngifez' iphupho lami
Mmh kuyafana mos, I know you hear about me
About me, about me
I hope you hear about me, about me
Even after all this downs

[Verse 1]
I wonder why I'm still here breathing
Used to be ta nice guy, this year beasting
North side living and haters jus can't believe it
I don't have to worry 'bout no ceiling leaking
Why should I be scared of another man?
One shot to the face take you straight to lala land
Roll Up is a hit and I wasn't dissing Jabba man
Just a simple cosign I hope that you understand
(Yeah) I love my parents for giving me life
If I make 10mil I'm giving 'em five
Don't ask me nothing 'bout the shit that I mix with the sprite
Didn't get maths, numbers on the board and I'm getting it right
Phela I'mma get it tonight
Now that I'm winning it's nice
I cost a different price
You probably doing it for likes
I tried to ask for your advice
Just a young prude on, they told me 'No' like thrice

[Chorus]
Ngiyazi ukuth awujabuli mawungibona ngifez' iphupho lami
Mmh kuyafana mos, I know you hear about me
About me, about me
I hope you hear about me, about me
Even after all this downs

[Verse 2]
Emtee Da hustler
Higher than a Rasta
Cool, calm and collected me I'm never lastag
Run up on me wrong then you might get a fast trap
Akusheshwe kgwap kgwap
I'm tryna get the bucks up
Young man doing things, you should be inspired
I had run the city so much I'm getting tired
Big moves, lil' dude, heart of a lion
Ran up on em like the police with no siren
Jozi city lights don't blind 'em
Look at how every single label tryna sign me
Who came through when have been turnin' up in traffic
Freestyled the song didn't even have air clips
That's the same song got me chilling with the cashes
Talking about jets now
Tell me who the baddest
Matatiele mind
Ladies saying I'm fine
If you tryna hate, pick a better time

[Chorus]
Ngiyazi ukuth awujabuli mawungibona ngifez' iphupho lami
Mmh kuyafana mos, I know you hear about me
About me, about me
I hope you hear about me, about me
Even after all this downs

[Outro]
Yeah... yeah we finally here
Yeah we finally here
After so much hard work
Trying to survive in the streets of Jo'burg
Working hard but not getting the acknowledgement you deserve
Getting double-crossed, sleeping on floors
You know this is really what I always wanted to do
My whole life I did nothing but this... So here I am
I'd like you to get to know me where I'm from
And how I got here
