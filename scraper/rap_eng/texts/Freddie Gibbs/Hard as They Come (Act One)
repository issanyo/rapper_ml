[Verse 1: Natti]
I’m a monster that don’t reside up under your bed
I’mma march to the beat that I put into your head
Send shots to your liver I deliver you death
You can barter your tomorrow but a martyr you’re left
Get you hot under the collar when my name’s on your breath
Click the starter on your Impala I’ll be there when you wreck
Fucking with me you better keep your feelings in check
Be the life of the party or a lifeless body
Get with me thinking you hard, you’ll be hardly standing
I’m the hardest of them all, you’re the hardest landing
Face first in the asphalt, your ass talked
Too reckless, now you helpless from the rounds you caught
I’ll teach your ass a lesson, outlined in chalk
Have you hostage in the hospice, high and trying to walk
I am bravery in a bottle, I am courage in a glass
I got the government’s approval, prohibition couldn’t last
I go hard

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
C’mon lets ride out
The whole family over for Christmas dinner
Let’s go through the purses and sell the gifts from your mom's house
They know you out here doing dirt for cash
Plus you the one unemployed, a couple dollars ain’t gon hurt they ass
I’m the only friend you got
You tried to sell me but you took a hit and eventually you just couldn’t stop
A couple of sniffs would get you lit but couldn’t get you to the top
Oh what an event when you got hip to cooking me into them rocks
I had you locked, you know it costs to come and see me
So fuck yo groceries, fuck yo bills, go on and pawn that TV
And fuck yo life, just catch this beam and take it straight to the dome
And fuck yo kids, the state’ll separate em’ and place em’ in homes
It’s gonna be cool, I know I got you crazy subdued
Ever since the 80’s played your whole community for a fool
And the ones that sold me smoke each other over new tennis shoes
They field niggas, I’m the definition of death, the real killa

[Verse 3: Kno]
I’m with the fiends on the block playing shoot em’ up
When I erupt makes it hard to know who to trust
People scared to test me since the 80’s
Anybody can get it, man woman or baby
Shots do not discriminate, impossible to eliminate
I disseminate, you disintegrate
I can come off as a prick, you might get stuck with me
I’ll prolly steal your girl if you try and fuck with me
Cause next to me you’re looking quite frail
And if you snitch you’ll be counting your days in white cells
Just needlessly in CB4, ask the CDC, no CD4’s
Cause the truth is I’m on America’s dick
Uncle Sam fucks the poor and it’s making em’ sick
Now their life’s in a tube, a downward spiral
Give a new meaning to going viral
I’m hard as they come
