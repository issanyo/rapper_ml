[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I’m like a nigga fresh up out the county, nothing but killers around me
In the bathroom on my knees trying to flush the dope when they found me
And the men behind these walls murder niggas that get to mouthy
Down to die for my dignity, God bless the nigga that doubt me
Cause it’s either me or him and I’m damn sure choosing me
If there’s confusion both of us gon’ be using in the street
I got to do some shit to them before they do some shit to me
Niggas kill you when you ain’t looking they knew they couldn’t compete
I’m just as crooked as a politician, cold on my opposition
Taking chances so I can pay the price that’s for proper living
Got one foot in the grave and one foot in the penitentiary
Snitches that speak my name hope you choke and die when you mention me
Bitch, ‘cause all my life I live illegal
Don’t give no fuck ‘bout the law and my pockets be just zero
I’m thinking ‘bout take these kilos from these three amigos
Do the shit the American way, nigga, you know how we roll

[Hook: Studio]
I’m just like you
And you just like me
Gettin’ high, yeah, chief my tweed
Said I’m just like you
And you just like me
Hustle hard, tryna slang my speech
Said I’m just like you
And you just like me
In the jungle tryna raise my seeds
Said I’m just like you
And you just like me
Yeah we all got wants and needs
Said I’m just like you

[Verse 2: Natti]
I like my chicks thicker than the bottom of the Kool-Aid pitcher
And my Swishers thick enough to be a magic city stripper
Full of that sticky icky got to flick it off your finger
Haters can't hit it with me so I flip them all the finger
Cause I stay in my peep hole expecting them people
Walkie-talkies, doughnuts, and coffee wrapped up in street clothes
Loose lip niggas disrespecting the G code
I don't fuck with nobody what they fucking with me for
I'm just out here chasing mines trying to watch my step
While the watchers watch your hustle watch your watch so watch your neck
If you know what time it is you can't be slipping for a sec
And if you on what I'm on your life is playing through the deck

[Hook]
