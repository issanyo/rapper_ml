[Hook]
Just take a look up in my circle, all guerillas
And move in silence, they too gangsta for them pictures
That tequila hit my liver, give me shivers
There's only gangsters and them strippers in this villa
Who them niggas, we them niggas
Who them niggas, we them niggas
Who them niggas, we them niggas
We them niggas, we them niggas

[Verse 1: Free Ackrite]
Police and dope fiends still passin' where sittin at
Bring it back, teflon on my chest, I ain't leavin that
Philly cap backwards, gun under the mattress
Poly on the beat, i gotta smash it
A savage out the north, look me up
I cannot be touched
Beat three cases in six months, fuck the judge
I'm a thug up in this spaceship
Need a pretty bitch, who gon' take dick
And never tell a soul 'bout our relations
Penthouse, big trips, bitch I'm on another level
Oh it feel good for some real niggas to come together
No way, no jealousy, rich nigga with felonies
Fuck goin' to jail, boy that money made a better me
Ain't no shame in my game, I'm a ghetto superstar
Pull up on your block, just to remind you who we are
Big guns, big drum, lay a nigga down
Choppa hold a hundred, I'ma send off every round

[Hook]
Just take a look up in my circle, all guerillas
And move in silence, they too gangsta for them pictures
That tequila hit my liver, give me shivers
There's only gangsters and them strippers in this villa
Who them niggas, we them niggas
Who them niggas, we them niggas
Who them niggas, we them niggas
We them niggas, we them niggas

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I eat Popeyes Chicken in my Bentley, bitch I'm niggerish
Iced out Presidential, plain Daytona, ain't no chicken shit
Niggas got big nuts around their homies, boy you been a bitch
My Russian get them tracking numbers jumpin, boy we sendin' shit
Codeine, lemonade  and razor blade, I shave boulders
I pop another perc it help a nigga stay focused
Shot up the parking lot, I got another case open
My ho gon' bail me out, I got her Rollie face frozen, legit
Fresh up off a brick, fresh up off a brick
Mask off when I murder, it's a hit, it ain't no attempt
If you front that boy work, he's a lick,I don't owe him shit
Fuckin' up a plate of steak and shrimp, doggin' on your bitch
AR with the rocket launcher chopper like Antonio
5, 6 years ago, I pushed the Spur like San Antonio
Copped that all black Mulsanne, all white guts, that thing was Oreo
When I rode that bus these freak hoes act like they don't know me though, legit

Who them niggas, we them niggas
We them niggas, we them niggas
