[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Girl put some paper in my pocket, let me know it’s real
Keep that tattoo with his name, bitch I know the deal
Come through on a late night while he working, bitch you know I will
Beat that pussy up, I’m bout to put this shit in overkill
Overdrive, ass, mouth and legs, keep em open wide
Where you want this dick girl, take yo pick, I let yo ho decide
Fuck and take a shower in the place you and your ho reside
Baby what you smokin, or you tryina bust it open, right?
She might be your wifey, but she my nigga
No flowers or candy, kush and Hennesy when I hit her
I stand at attention, when you send me them naked pictures
Got her rolling cigarillos, I made her switch from the swishers
We cough, and we choke, then we fuck, and we smoke
All again, on the fen, it’s a win, when I’m in
That pussy throbbing like a sub
Throw some bud wit a thug, hit my number when you horny
And know your way from the club, she like

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
Daddy, where have you been?
Been on the grind, getting mine, making stacks, bitch
Daddy, where have you been?
Now I got pussy on my mind, where it's at bitch?
Daddy, where have you been?
Been on the grind, getting mine, making stacks, bitch
Daddy, where have you been?
Been on my paper, smoking on that Jamaica, what’s up

[Verse 2: Sasha Go Hard]
I been on the grind, getting mine, that makes two of us
I can't see niggas, I guess I'm blind cause it's you I trust
You I love, put nothing above but my bucks
No matter what, nobody to fuck cause it's you I love
Body on a leash, beauty and the beast
OG, can't wait to meet that money that you make for me
Tell niggas stay away from me
I could roll up all your weed
Be rap bitches scared to be
There to be round one hundred, you care for me
Wonder where you been, it depends, trying to spend
All your time with my man, in my mind I understand
But I got a plan when you in, make me dance with no hands
Type of pussy make a nigga spend
And spin, after that go get it back
Something that these niggas and bitches wishing they had
It's sad, but I'm glad
I enjoy the times that we got from the back
I enjoy the times that we had and that's that

[Hook]
