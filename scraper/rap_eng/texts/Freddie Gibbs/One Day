[Hook: Young Giftz]
Fresh home off the road, Pyrex on the stove
$40,000 worth of coke, Kush jam OG in by the loads
Shop quick nigga erry'thing must go
Hope you know my young niggas bout gunplay
30 shots leave a nigga dead on the one way
Sneak dissin' be careful what that tongue say
Ya'll gonna run into some real niggas one day

[Verse]
Lord willin Ima make a million if i keep finessin with this cocaine
Plug calling tryina front a pack and I dont even know this nigga whole name
Ima let him ship it keep on doin business til we work up to a whole thang
Once I get it, hit it, changing up my digits, welcome homie to the dope game
Keep a pistol I ain't no lame. you be [?] with her no name
Last time he tried to catch me laccin [?]
Out in traffic with a new dame. Rollin dutches mixin two strains
Keep her with me, so the Police miss me but this bitch be thinking she my boo thang
Nigga who changed? tell me who changed, still the same nigga tatt the crew name
All my young niggas ain't for food games, put your face picture on the new Hanes
I could J witcha if ya move cane, 36 off the bat. Gettin them 4 28's
Just made 8 grand all off the tax

[Verse: Freddie Gibbs]
I been bending corners, reefer chiefing, package in the speaker, pocket full of boulders
Rolling with some youngin's choppa so humongous nigga gotta wear it on his shoulder
Nigga fuck it, ain't no duckin, runnin, bustin at the fuckin' law they behind us
Every nigga with me down to do 150 years nigga we some ridas
Fuck nigga check rank, dope dealer til my death date
Stove or microwave it, whip it, wet weight, smoking fiddle, Brillo in they chest plate
Got a $100,000 on my neck piece, 'nother $50,000 on my wrist bitch
Gotcha babymomma baggin in the kitchen gave her steady money and some stiff dick
Freddie Kane baby, Freddie Forgiato, nigga disrespect dont live to see tomorrow
She dont smoke or ride, if she dont suck and swallow
Instagram her hope she fuck me for a follow. Nigga watch whatcha tongue say
Gary niggas bout the gun play, super stupid pack Im talking dumb yay
Ima stick the plug up one day, goddamn
