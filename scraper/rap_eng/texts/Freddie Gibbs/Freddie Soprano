[Verse 1]
Shitting on niggas, my raps is laxative
Good killer, dope in my bloodstream, that’s just how I live
Good killer, dope in my bloodstream, that’s just how I'm dying
Before I go, pounds of kush and powder, that’s all I’m buying
Started below motherfucking zero
First check that I got from rap
Man I raised my 'Lac and copped a kilo
Since then I ain’t been back, straight transactions with my niggas
Few times your boy fell off
But I jumped right back on with the quickness
Freddie Willis to Freddie McClane, yippee ki-yay motherfuckers
I yelled out, Chichi, get that heron and that yay, motherfucker
We yelling fuck the world until it’s over
I’m only halfway through my movie, ready to war with Sosa
Where my toaster? I got the breakfast for these niggas
Bitches, strudel their noodles
Snatch their hearts out like a Pop Tart
You’re losing, we’re moving through you
I’m the smoothest nigga doing this from L.A. to Philly
I feel like Kobe doing work, I just might tear my Achilles
If I don’t take a load off, can't, gotta get this blow off
Bustas thought I would show up at his door
Told 'em knock the store off
Renovate these niggas' houses over quarters and ounces
I copped that Polo selling dolo, never had no allowance
That’s on my mama, my mama know it
Some months electric, gas and water, we couldn’t afford it
I’m soda whipping, yola stretching, hot water boiling
Fuck the police, cause if they catch us, straight to the toilets
And all my gangsta niggas know it

[Hook]
Nigga, test me, I’ll send my some bullets with my reply
I’m straight for life, all I gotta do is stay back and die
I’m straight for life, all I gotta do is stay back and die
I’m straight for life, all I gotta do is stay back and die
A nigga diss me, I’ll send my some bullets with my reply
I’m straight for life, all I gotta do is stay back and die
I’m straight for life, all I gotta do is stay back and die
I’m straight for life, all I gotta do is stay back and die

[Verse 2]
Dropping this pill in a cup of dope
Man, just take a breather, rappers is having seizures and strokes
Yeah, that type of shit make niggas sit back and stick to the smoke
Nigga dead before his thirties, an overdose ain’t no joke
I ain’t one for slacking on my habits
I brush my teeth with Hennessy, sleep with my automatic
My nigga hit my line, he ’bout to touch down with that package
I know the whole house is funky when they rip the package
Everlasting, headed for hell or the jail cell
Won’t be a monkey for them crackers like I’m LL
So fuck a Cool J cookie, it’s shrimp and lobster tail
I’ve got two dykes that’ll throw a bike out in Lauderdale
All is well when I bail
Working that scale through the day and the night
This V and this L that I throw up don’t stand for “Vampire Life”
So sorry Mr. Jones, twisting your fingers can get you gone
Shout out to the Lords, shout to the Folks, word to the Stones
Bitch I'm from where niggas don't survive
A real OG, I ain’t start banging at twenty-five
Exotic taste, got exotic bitches, exotic rides
You just a neutron nigga, go work a 9-5
A 9-5 got my college girl to take a trip
Now she think she a gangster bitch
Said I’m the coldest nigga to spit this gangster shit since Jadakiss
Niggas can’t go like Freddie Soprano, that’s on the mob
Jeezy wrote me off, he traded the trapping for office jobs
But it’s cool, nigga
Got my own plate, you can’t feed me with your spoon, nigga
Get your paper, I’ll let your partners play the fool, nigga
The real realest nigga in it
Way, way back I kept that strap with Lil’ Rob in his Infiniti
Told me if I tried this rap, I’d be a legend ‘fore I finish
Gangster G.I., what’s the motherfucking business?
Nigga, he told me if I tried this rap, I’d be a legend ‘fore I finish
Gangster G.I., what’s the motherfucking business?
Nigga, we hit ‘em up
