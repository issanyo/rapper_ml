[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]

I'm a cold motherfucker with the shit
Dump a ice bucket on my wrist
She ain't fuckin' I ain't fuckin' with the bitch
I remember when I used to hit the cluckers with the whip
4 a.m. I got a kitchen full of customers and shit
Got 'em beamin' up the scotty
Freddie bout to throw a powder party
Forgiatos on that four-door Maserati
Got that Cutlass 442
It sound like Nascar when you start it
Bitch don't play I pull that trigger like Carmelo at the garden
What you know about it?
Robbin' for the powder
100 in the trunk I bet you all them bitches solid
7 Series BM, I got all these bitches flockin'
Plan to get this shit legit I know the county's gonna be watchin'
Bumpin' 40 with my 40. caliber I'm on my J.O
And I hope I don't go back to slangin' yayo for my mayo
But fuck it though, my youngin' threw some stacks out on the table
Said that birdie thang' could go for 40 tre but that's o.k. though
Let my tombstone quote
Motherfuck bein' broke
So bury me with 20, 30 k and somethin' to smoke
Tell em' fuck a eulogy just read some gutter shit I wrote
Pour some henny on the corner, roll a blunt and make a toast
To a real nigga, Trill nigga'
Still thuggin' in the field with ya'
My little niggas they be up and skippin' class in the mornin'
Kush pack blowin'
Gonna smoke him and his homie, bought em' all a pair of Jordan's
And I'm living like a Eastside Rider, Straight grinder
I know niggas with the 5 pack of white china
And it's hard to do the rappin', leave this life behind ya'
When i'm countin' up 100 k on my recliner
Lazy-boy, Praise this boy
Gary street's couldn't plague this boy
Made this boy
Do some cold things for a dollar
Take a nigga' for ransom, He in the trunk of my Impala
For the blocka blocka
All my noccas chillin' in the 6
Bumpin' that Cali Ice Bucket Challenge on my wrist
Thuggin', Black in the U.S. it's a challenge to exist
Stove 1000 degrees, Imma' graduate to a brick
I be gradually gettin' chips
All my smokers coppin' the pack of that package
If you can move it I give you points on the pack, nigga'

Gangsta Gibbs baby ahaha

Westwood we in this thang' mayne'!
