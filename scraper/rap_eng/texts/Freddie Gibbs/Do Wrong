[Hook: Pill]
Oh Lord
When the world don't do you right can't help but do wrong
Got this thug shit in my life and I can't move on
I just roll up, light my lye and get my cruise on
You can roll these streets with me

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Come on let’s go on this field trip
Let me see if this some shit you can deal with
And if you don’t get stuck up you gon’ be stuck on some real shit
Stuck on stackin stupid dollars, motherfuckin student loan
Nigga straight hit a lick back in 02 that shit threw me on
Threw me off, my momma’s older brother used to do the soft
Then he started smoking rocks i wonder if he knew the cost
My other uncle showed me how to whip and weigh the pound
Just seen him with the pipe, man he been beamin up since 89
Four figures from fillin orders i can facilitate
If you wasn’t bangin or slangin you could participate
Suckers came to philly eh the police’s can litigate
But if they pitchin weight, we pay a visit, set them niggas straight
Bitch im thuggin till my death day
Phil spector niggas vocal cords, charlie manson niggas chest plates
I flirt with death on the day that i fuck the bitch
Bury me with my zipper down so my haters can suck my dick
Im like

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
Oh Lord
When the world don't do you right can't help but do wrong
Got this thug shit in my life and I can't move on
I just roll up, light my light and get my cruise on
You can roll these streets with me

[Bridge:Freddie Gibbs]
But they don't play around, though the sickness
Move in silence, they don't make sound
Dark faces in the darkness, that will lay you down
No wife i'm married to this game, i made a vow
Yea baby, come roll these streets with me

[Verse 2: Pill]
Pocket full of nalles with some rockes right beside me
9mm psychic, make em wait i'm a ?
Macgyver, and for this paper i'm a scuba diver
I'm diverse, guaranteed you won't step no feet on my dirt
You'll die first, and tell your home boys about it in afterlife
