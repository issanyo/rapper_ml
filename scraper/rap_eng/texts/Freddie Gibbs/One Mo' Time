[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
It's been a while since I've seen your face
It's strange, but, I can't complain you're in a better place
It ain't a question; I know you're resting in heaven
Ask God to let you listen to me for a second
There's some things that I wanted to say
Because for a while life wasn't going your way
Then the next thing I know you were gone for good
Caught up in the cycle that plagues the hood
First niggas move the salt, then comes the crack
Mill laid him off, the streets called him back
You always told me what drugs would do
That's why I still looked up to you when nobody trusted you
I saw my favorite hustler turn into a customer
It killed me like a bullet to the jugular
I wish I could have stopped the bullet that hit you

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
I miss you until the day I'm with you
One more time
That's all I need
Because it was never easy to let you go
I want you to know
I love you and I won't forget you
Miss you till I'm with you
One more time
That's all I need
Because it was never easy to let you go
I want you to know
I love you and I won't forget you
Miss you till I'm with you

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I flame the Jane
And 16 bars ain't enough to explain the pain
I can drink a whole fifth
Burn a whole zip
When the high wears off the stress still exists
So, I get blitzed the whole day and never think twice
I'm guessing I should change my life
Don't wanna get caught slipping and easily get my wig splitted
In my city, at any given minute, you can get it
I done lost a lot of homies over dumb shit
That cousin ? I ain't going out like no punk shit
Car accidents, terminal illness
Death is something you gotta deal with
Rest in peace to my homies; the lord called them home
Quay Shepard, Andrew Jones, and Little Ramon
You're gonna live through the kid
So, I'll never forget you

[Hook]
