[Intro]
Yeah.. Okay (yeah)
Motherfucker it's player gangster, gangster Gibbs (nigga)
Gangster, gangster, ganster Gibbs, Motherfucker
Fuck wit me, where the cognac? It's gangster, gangster, gangster Gibbs nigga
Okay, yeah, here we go, okay, yo

[Verse 1]
I made it out the hood, life is good, life is great
Been straight from the gate, pulling my own weight
Fuck the lames and the fakes that I know gon' hate
I sit around and debate 'bout the dough I make
Just know that I'mma get more cheese than you'll ever get
I'm motivated by stacking them dead presidents
I remember when times was hard in my residence
Got up on my hustle I've been getting money ever since
Now I two step to the beat, fresh pair of stick up kids on my feet
Gold on my neck, green in my chest, y'all niggas need to give it a rest
Cause you ain't fucking with the gangster G-I-B-B-S, yes

[Bridge]
Hope you got your bud, 'cos I'mma light mine, I'm about to get right for the night time
Big business bitch, big money stacks, go on bless that bottle, it's all cognac, yeah

[Hook X2]
Pop bottles from the night to the morn', take another shot to the dome and get gone
If this ain't right then I just gotta be wrong, I get in the zone and then it's o-o-on
It's on
O-o-on, o-o-on, o-o-o-o-o-o-o-on!

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Mo' money mo' liquor, the hoes fuck a little quicker
Bank account, got a little thicker
Shout to my niggas gettin' it in
You know it's all cognac when we kick it again
I can still remember way back then we lived grimy
Me, Skyler, Lil Rob and big Stylee
Used to sit back in the 'llac and get dome
Run up on my clique, the fifth will get blown
I can't stop bitches from calling my phone
They love me everywhere but ain't no place like home
So I'mma rep 'till the lord seperate me from the flesh
And the midwest know I'm the best:
That's why they fucking with the gangster, G-I-B-B-S, yes

[Bridge]

[Hook X2]

[Outro]
Yeah, nigga
Now get your drunk ass up, now sit your drunk ass down
These niggas know that it's
Gangster, gangster, ganster Gibbs nigga, it's gangster, gangster, gangster, gangster Gibbs nigga!
Yeah, pop a bottle with your kids
Gangster, gangster, gangster Gibbs nigga
Yeah, it's all cognac, pop a bottle with me
Oh man leave all this shit man, for real
It's all cognac
