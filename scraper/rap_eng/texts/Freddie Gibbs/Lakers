[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Hello, this is headquarters
For sure, Gangsta Gibbs, baby
Uhh, E-S to the G-N, yeah
L.A., shout out, hahahah, yeah

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Nigga, fuck it, 77 Cutlass
I move my ass to Cali with my Indiana bucket
I need to slap a wet one on the frame, a little rusty
They call my shit a scraper, in the Bay the bitches love it
And I'm choking on some Cali good
Been wanted to cruise on Crenshaw
Since a little nigga watching "Boyz n the Hood"
Since Ricky got killed, copping that corn meal
Before the palm trees, pussy and the recording years
I was overdue for a visit
A valley bitch with family in the Chi gave me the digits
The 8-1-8, the sex was great, perfect the art of fornication
Put a bitch out the car for a bar, your Cali conversation
All my hoes from way back want me to be chilling where they at
G.I. until I die but bitch L.A. is where I lay at
My children gon' be raised at where they gon' place my grave at
Since Magic bought the team, he brought new meaning to that L.A. hat
And shout out to the blocks, Inglewood, Compton, South Central to Watts

[Hook: Polyester The Saint & (Freddie Gibbs)]
My home, my home (that's where I stay at, nigga)
L.A. I ride for you (that's where I lay at, nigga)
When I am gone (that's where I stay at, nigga)
Just know that I owe you (that's where I lay at, nigga)
My home, my home (L.A.)
L.A. I ride for you (you know I ride for you)
When I am gone (for sure)
Just know that I owe you (uhh, uhh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I'm on my way to LAX from JFK
It's a great day
I mean I love New York, but of course
I live out there so don't go there, you heard it before
Ironic my uncle had the king of music on Crenshaw
Cause now I'm the king to music to all y'all
California love, California dreaming
I've seen lost angels, I even found demons
Where you learn to survive and keep your head high
Hit the weed clinic for sativa get your head high
We ain't in Kansas City, but you'll find a TEC-9
And if that tech jammed, you better have a toast too
Fuck that, this what we gon' toast to
Everybody that ain't die before 21 like we was s'posed to
For the mail, I'm going postal
I heard the baddest females off pacific coastal
If it means anything, I'm so L.A., my dad died on King, nigga

[Hook: Polyester The Saint & (Freddie Gibbs)]
My home, my home (that's where I stay at, nigga)
L.A. I ride for you (that's where I lay at, nigga)
When I am gone (that's where I stay at, nigga)
Just know that I owe you (that's where I lay at, nigga)
My home, my home (L.A.)
L.A. I ride for you (you know I ride for you)
When I am gone (for sure)
Just know that I owe you (uhh, uhh, yeah)

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, went from a condo to sleeping on my nigga couch
Popping sedatives, negatives in my bank account
Too much pride to let this pussy industry play me out
Repairing that broken dream, thatâ€™s what L.A. about
Shout to Cali Bud, my West Coast plug
Brother from another mother, he showed that West Coast love
Nigga, me and Killa Caz was pulling them stick-ups, cuz
Bending blocks with my nigga Box smoking the whip up, Blood
Gots to keep it true when I maneuver
I got all kind of homies, Harlems, Avalons and Hoovers
My little homie from Families, he keep a team of shooters
My 60 niggas stay Rolling, my Eight Trey niggas moving
Been 20 years since the riots
L.A. niggas keep it thorough, fuck keeping quiet
Bitch it's on in this war zone where we reside
As I begin, let my sins wash away with the tide
Who the fuck I'm kidding? I done tried everything but dying
Flirting with other places but this Cali bitch stay on my mind

[Hook: Polyester The Saint & (Freddie Gibbs)]
My home, my home (that's where I stay at, nigga)
L.A. I ride for you (that's where I lay at, nigga)
When I am gone (that's where I stay at, nigga)
Just know that I owe you (that's where I lay at, nigga)
My home, my home (L.A.)
L.A. I ride for you (you know I ride for you)
When I am gone (for sure)
Just know that I owe you (uhh, uhh, yeah)

[Skit: 2Pac]
This is not a new allegiance to the West Coast
I've been on the West Coast all this time
