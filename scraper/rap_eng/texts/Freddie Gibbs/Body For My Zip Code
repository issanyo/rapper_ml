[Intro]
Real shit, real shit nigga
Yeah, uh
Homicide city, another homicide

[Verse 1: Young Life]
Catch your body for my zip code
Leave your top open like a fishbowl
Just know niggas on the block with the fish scale
Get a bowl, hit it slow
Everybody on the block they just tryna get it though
Get it though
And tell a nigga bout a three way, no subliminals
We be climbin' through your window slow
Big magazine make you centerfold
Push the envelope, make a wall pop like you're in a coke
Finish you
Whippin' through Iraq, nigga fuck Obama
These niggas is fish swimmin' with piranhas
Watch homie get killed right on that corner
He was chasin' commas now he's a goner
Now we so focused cause we so hopeless
Grandma came down to me and spoke this
The game ain't full of shit but vultures
Your homies ain't your homies, nigga you ain't owe shit
Compton academy
Up 10 with no batteries, that's why they mad at me
Some homies is causalities
That's my reality, go on the faculty
Hundred round drum when the K come
Young niggas racin' down the Crans as the bass thump
They won't give it to me, I'ma take some
Know I must pay for my sins when the day come

[Chorus: Young Life]
Catch a body for my zip code
(Leave your top open like a fishbowl, Just know niggas on the block)
Catch a body for my zip code
(Leave your top open like a fishbowl, homicide city another homicide)
Catch a body for my zip code
(Leave your top open like a fishbowl, Just know niggas on the block)
Catch a body for my zip code
(Leave your top open like a fishbowl, Just know niggas on the block)

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Fingertips numb from the cocaine
Twenty thousand every time my door swing
Count it up again when the door close
Plug fronted you the work, you in a dope hole
Have the nigga workin' round the clock, takin' no doors
Same clothes, nigga never serve the popos
Homie the Presidential Rollie, it was so froze
He was ice cold till the shit got up in his nose
I done seen kings turn to crack fiends
Baby used to keep the wheels on the 'Lac clean
Fucked around and caught a beam with a trap queen
Was wrappin' packages before I had a rap dream
Was wrappin' packages before I had a rap dream
Was doin' robberies before I had a rap show
The type of nigga throw a (?) in the pot
And drive a foreign off the lot
And cop the motor in the back ho
Cause every day a nigga flexin'
Finessin', full clip in my weapon
I blow like Bob Marley, no worries, no stressin'
Head honcho, the boss boy, I play my position
Bitch I feel like Nino before he was snitchin', God damn

[Chorus: Young Life]
Catch a body for my zip code
(Leave your top open like a fishbowl, Just know niggas on the block)
Catch a body for my zip code
(Leave your top open like a fishbowl, homicide city another homicide)
Catch a body for my zip code
(Leave your top open like a fishbowl, Just know niggas on the block)
Catch a body for my zip code
(Leave your top open like a fishbowl, Just know niggas on the block)

[Verse 3: Dave East]
I ain't from south central, nigga I'm a menace
Get up out the car homie, handle business
I give my youngin' 500 to handle witness
I find out you hiding out? Your man'll get it
Catch a body for my neighborhood
I got a ratchet with the numbers scratched off plus I aim for good
I had the kush out in Ravenswood
Back in Harlem, had the sour if you talkin' better make it good
Better make it quick, I'm with a Jamaican bitch
Black and grey Raider fit, drugs you can take your pick
This ain't for your Instagram, don't take a pic
I was tryna take some grams, flip it all, make me rich
When I get around this money, it make me itch
Finger fuckin' my nina, I'll make you take a shit
Got a bag where your stomach used to be
And I ain't talkin' Billboard but my youngin's makin' hits
Prolly run up in your crib for the safe box
Don't forget that combination when the pressure on
Sweat drippin' on the chrome .45
And your life if a nigga breath wrong
And I hate cops

[Chorus: Young Life]
Catch a body for my zip code
(Leave your top open like a fishbowl, Just know niggas on the block)
Catch a body for my zip code
(Leave your top open like a fishbowl, homicide city another homicide)
Catch a body for my zip code
(Leave your top open like a fishbowl, Just know niggas on the block)
Catch a body for my zip code
(Leave your top open like a fishbowl, Just know niggas on the block)

[Outro: Young Life]
Homicide city, another homicide
Homicide city, another homicide
Homicide city, another homicide
Homicide city, another homicide
