[Hook]
I make it look easy, way too easy [x4]

[Freddie Gibbs: Verse 1]
Can't walk a day inside my size 12's
Not mentally ready for the places my mind dwells
When I think about everything I'm faced with, man, will I prevail?
Know I didn't come this far to lose, only time will tell
Haters wanna copy me and study my moves
Every year I rejuvenate, it's like I'm new and improved
You can see me and my crew is so elusive
Excuse the way we act, refuse the kiddy rap, y'all could keep that
The way I jumped in this game was nothing to sneeze at
A lot of people spoke foul words, they had to eat that
Oops I meant eat those, this the life that we chose
Make this thing look easy till the clock be hitting zero

[Hook]
I make it look easy, way too easy
You can never be me or see me please believe me [x4]

[Freddie Gibbs: Verse 2]
I made a name up in my size 12's
I rhyme well, now the world is my clientele
And I'm crushing all the competition cause their rhymes stale
From the beginning, I was winning, you was down to fail
Str8 Killa No Filla, I get ill as thriller on the beat
Cause I got the upper-hand, I'm never dealing wit defeat
Want to win so bad, some times at night, it's difficult to sleep
From a neighborhood where folks couldn't keep their children out the streets
But I made it out in one piece, luckily
Bad luck was ducking me, seen some situations coulda got ugly
Now it's even clear to see my future right in front of me
Hit the stage in yo city, they loving me

[Hook]
I make it look easy, way too easy
You can never be me or see me please believe me [x4]
