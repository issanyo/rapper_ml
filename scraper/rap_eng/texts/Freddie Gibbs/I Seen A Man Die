[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Ten bullets in his ass, hit the gas
Ten deep on enemy turf, me and the homies 'bout to mash
Where that glass? Glock was plastic, smoking that gas, puff with the fastest
Bitch get wilding, Gangsta Island, Gary
Smiling in my casket with my eyes wide open
I'ma make my enemy look me straight in my face before they closing
I'ma pierce right through his soul and take control of his emotions
Let it haunt you in your dreams
Bitch kill you, kiss your mama, just like Bishop did Raheem
Before I seen a nigga cry, I seen a young nigga die
Over a Georgetown Starter jacket and some new Jordan 5s
Blessed in this shit, blessed in this shit, question is, will I survive?
Laid out with a hot gun smoking, on his own blood choking, Gangsta Gibbs, bitch

[Hook x3: Freddie Gibbs and Lil' Sodi]
Before I seen a nigga cry, I seen a young nigga die
(Gotta live my life, in this cold word)

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Four, five niggas smoking weed in my Cadillac
Six, seven straps with the beam, that's a matter of fact
Eight, nine geekers, make 'em fiend for a piece of crack
Got ten, eleven youngsters in my kitchen, watch me teach 'em that
You call that reaching back? You call that building up?
Fried bologna and a cracker, that was the meal for us
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I, born and die a sinner, but
Blessings over bullets, I pray the Lord deliver
Gibbs, I'm gangbanging, caine slanging

[Hook x3]

Four, five niggas smoking weed in my Cadillac
Six, seven straps with the beam, that's a matter of fact
Four, five niggas smoking weed in my Cadillac
Six, seven straps with the beam, that's a matter of fact

[Outro: Lil' Sodi]
Lil' Sodi, Gangsta Gibbs, ESGN nigga
Real niggas
Fucked with him since day one, nigga
Gangsta Gibbs
Living our life in this cold world, nigga
Take a slug, and still at this shit, nigga
You already know, Lil' Sodi
All the neighbors know, L.A
Gibbs, love you 'til the end, nigga
You my bro
You already know
Love you homie
