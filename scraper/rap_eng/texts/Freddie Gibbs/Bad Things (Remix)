[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
One day somebody told me life is like a traffic jam
Just in approaching my exit will I be back again
My homies tell me, "Keep reppin' for us"; you got it fam'
"If you can’t put the G on the map then nobody can"
Kush crumbs on plush seats, like 4 deep in a Delta '88, straight bucket with no beat
But we ride it like a Bentley
I’m bending corners and blowin' doja until the bag empty
Can you feel me?

[Hook: Cults]
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself playing the diamond in the rough
But honestly I've never had much sympathy
Cause next time you're praying you'll be praying for me
I'm gonna run, run away, run run away, run away
Run away and never come back
(Weed cigarillos, please don't bury me without those)
Run run away, run run away, run away show em which color is black
(Been wrong to get my paper right)

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I was the bad seed of my household
Servin' these cluckers, baby brother better keep his mouth closed
Mama complaining bout the indo, I blow it out, though
Weed cigarillos please don't bury me without those
Got some bad habits, sex and cash addict
And when it came to doin' bad I wasn't bad at it
My friend's sister, cousin trying to see which ass fattest
Take their breath like Toni Braxton, all my bitches asthmatic
Keep these hoes hyperventilating when I be penetrating
I'm in Philippe's finishing a filet, is you finished hating?
Cause if you ain't I’ll add some dirty deeds to my demonstration
My dirty...D'Eagle DL?...I only blow it on two occasions, that's day and night
Candy corona, I'm zonin' under Vegas lights
Can’t be your man, I just wanna hit it and take a hike
I'm just a lover, she take it off if I take a flight
Love a ghetto boy that do wrong to get his paper right

[Hook: Cults]
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself playing the diamond above
But honestly I've never had much sympathy
Cause the bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I'm gonna run, run away, run run away, run away
Run away and never come back
Run run away, run run away, run away show 'em which color is black
