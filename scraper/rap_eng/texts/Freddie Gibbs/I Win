[Verse 1: Polyester the Saint]
You don't really get it turnt, you don't get it poppin
You don't really put in work, you just wait and watch this
As I take you to a place that you never seen
Straight you worn out, cause you off that lean
But I ain't trippin, I get faded though
Daily grind, sippin wine, that's the way to go
Plus my cuddy got that good tree, on the low
Mix it with the tacos, off the stove
Let's get this party popping, turn up the base
Let's get it knockin
The cool done, turn up the base
So don't you get to start nothing
You didn't think we catch you slippin
But we steady watching
Back to the hoes, new clothes, new shoes
The city loves us
I'm on the rise, my ninja, I know you see
You wanna decline, pimping, you started cheese
We poking hoes and all you foes
That thing we sleeping
My eyes wide, open for them haters peeking

[Chorus: Polyester the Saint]
It's okay, it's alright
We got everything you like
Let's just show, what we do
Pull up to your block
Swerve off with your girl
She know how to do it

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
You ain't really whippin work, you ain't got a stove
Ice on the neck piece sit on my shirt
Wrist solid gold
As I hit you with some g shit you may never heard
Need cash for the feature, flow like dope
Get a bird off every word
Cope the 82 240, pouring up in your party
And these hoes used to ignore me
Till I put the '85 up on Forgi's
So shout my nigga Dom, these west coast hoes the bomb
And peace be unto you creep bitches would Alaikum my Salaam
I supply, I'm off the line, don't sell no dope after 9
Rather be 6 feet deep in the freak barbe key, if you don't mind
In some scales, as I cook up this yale, load up these shells
Watch your gal, like you watching your mail
She slick as jail, what the hell
Your bitch just slipped and fell on this dick
And my ratchet got back on taxes
Flip the check on the 5th
These niggas don't approach me reckless cause my record legit
Bitch fuck you man cause he ain't fuckin with this
It's Gangsta Gibbs baby!

[Chorus: Polyester the Saint]
It's okay, it's alright
We got everything you like
Let's just show, what we do
Pull up to your block
Swerve off with your girl
She know how to do it
