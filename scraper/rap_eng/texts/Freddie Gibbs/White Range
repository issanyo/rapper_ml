Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
That black wood in my white range, that 65 with that cocaine
That 95 with that yay yay, I-5 with that halftime
I'm taxing niggas, I'm decking niggas
I'm whacking niggas, be on max
I'm on it, I'm on it, yeah, yeah bitch, I'm on it
Fixed to ship my nigga Screwface a package from California
Never changed my price on the white bitch
They liked 'em, but couldn't afford 'em
Mixed my wrist like Prince
And the crack came back lighter than Apollonia
And my incense burning, West coast in my wood packed
Used to lace my blunts with that powder shit
But that was way back, I can't change that
Now I reminisce on them hot days
Reminisce on them cold nights
I was blessed to make it through my adolescence
Still fucking up in my dope life
But I still wouldn't change a thing
Cold blood running through my veins
That black wood in my white Range
To my white bitch to that right mayne
And I'm still gon' slang them thangs
East Side running through my veins
I shower bitches in champagne
Yeah, this the lifestyle of the insane

[Hook: Drake]
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Incense burning, still fucking my old bitch
Got problems off in my household, old girl be bringing up old shit
Get mad fighting, we go sit like whoâ€™s this ho you so close with?
Why the bitches calling your number if they just a group of bitches you smoke with
See Fred you a motherfucking dog
You the type of nigga got to have it all
You remind me of my pops
Want to cut a nigga off, but she can't stop
Want to cuss a nigga out till she can't breathe
Telling me that she gon' go, but she can't leave
Man Fred you could please when you get back home
She gone with the dog and the car keys
Got damn, now I'm realizing that I love her
Fucked up when I put this other life above her
Tricking off on a stripper, I bet I bust her
On the outside I'm too cool, but I'm broken up undercover
Hide my feelings through my drug habits
And I based my raps off my interactions with drug addicts
And drug dealers, them killers creeping coming for that paper
One of my own homies just might leave a nigga stanking
In a dope house weighing coke out

[Hook: Drake]
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
