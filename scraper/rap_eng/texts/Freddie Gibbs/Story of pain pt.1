(intro:TBoiSmoke)
Hm
Yuh
Aye hoe
TBoiSmoke up in this bitch nigga
(verse 1:TBoiSmoke)
Aweful things got me feeling a certain way
A way i can't explain
A way that will leave a stain
Leave my mark on this world, that's what i wanna do
Love is the source of all problems and depression, of every nigga who feel like they need a lesson
In the world called life, avoid getting a wife
When the bitch leave you she file for divorce
After your money is confiscated, kids taken by force
He ain't got no house, no family, no reason to live
Why bother standing up if everything goes to shit?
At first wanna get people lit, now i wanna get 'em feeling
Crying when you gone (uh) ratings hit the ceiling
When you die get noticed, but this shit too late
Cause what does money give, when you were taken by fate?
Life hasn't been easy and it never will
And everybody wanna be so real, they'll kill
It's what i was close to, switch lanes, before i got noodles for food
(bridge:TBoiSmoke)
I swear he says ''i wanna die''
Everyone screaming ''please give it another try''
But i mean didn't he have enough to suffer and to cry
(verse 2:TBoiSmoke)
Daily in agony life's fucking me over, so i gave him a tour, in my rover
He tell me to drive off a cliff, i'm done
So much pain, his legs are getting stiff
Please push on, don't push off
I don't wanna see you fall, even if you jumped off
That was act one of the story, you think he dead, but now i'm sorry
Laying in a hospital bed, in a coma, you was off the drugs
Somebody overdosed
Parents didn't bother to tell me about it
Thought it wasn't necessary
I don't need it's just fucking drama
That didn't happen again, after i got a knife  to my throat
So i learned not to be a snitch, and not to be a bitch
I was taught not to leave my niggas in a ditch
Don't snitch on them, and don't change on them
Cause you will get it back, and you will get that karma
Nobody cares until you get yo mamma
(outro:TBoiSmoke)
I grew up without a momma
It's painful bro, but aight
Gang bro
