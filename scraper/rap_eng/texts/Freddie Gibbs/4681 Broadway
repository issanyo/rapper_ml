[Verse 1]
4681 Broadway Road
Roll taught me everything I know
Laid the foundation
Gave me everything but my flow
Let me post up in the studio and learn the ropes
My daily escape from part-time-jobbin' and servin' dope
I even copped my first pound of Cali from his nephew, Jake
Tried to re-up but he got jumped on coming back from the bay
Ho, I was dro slangin'
Thirty deep at the local rap show, it was no tamin'
Freddie G was next up to bat though, name started ringin'
Even niggas that claimed the clique I claimed started hatin'
Ho nigga, you know you ain't real
Tears tatted on your face, but nigga, you know you ain't killed
Grown-ass wannabe gangsta, went to school in Merrillville (bitch)
Nigga's looking real suspicious to us
This one of them lames that's gon' stay local
Cause they lyrics was never vicious enough
A lot of them niggas I came in the game with
Can choke it down, the same dick -
They hoes (ho-ass niggas)
That's just the way shit goes

[Refrain]
I've seen all kind of trouble
I wait for that almighty dollar
That's how shit goes
Ah, I gets blowed
I gotta keep the thang close to my waistline
You never know who might try to take mine
That's how shit goes
Ah, I gets blowed

[Verse 2]
Damn, I used to feed these niggas
Gave all type of hoes, drank, and weed for these niggas
Taking it out of love, I didn't owe a thing to these niggas
I'm ready to do some evil deeds to these niggas
Proceed to squeeze triggers
It'll get strapped out or scrapped out
My dirt been documented
This just some shit that you rap 'bout
Some pussy niggas out here claiming they can see Fred
Just wanna be Fred
Don't end up buried up under these streets
Trying to get those street creds
So check it boy
I remember you used to get your ass beat by them ? boys
Nigga, let's get straight to the facts
There ain't a nigga in the G
That can say that he's as flame as me
I'm out here hitting the real licks
He was robbing a KFC
Ho, it's atrocious
Lost your focus
So you focused on my cheddar
Your brother, he was my dawg, we would always smoke together
It seemed like niggas rolled together
When we was out here broke together
But now they hoes (ho-ass niggas)
That's just the way shit goes

[Refrain]

[Interlude x4]
Sixteen shots, with one up in the hole
That's the way thugs roll

[Refrain]
