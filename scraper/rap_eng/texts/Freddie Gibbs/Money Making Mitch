[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
...Naw Jeezy can't come to
Gary, it's not like he could come anyways...


[Hook:]
Money making mitch, money making mitch
I’m in this bitch, I’m in this bitch I feel like money making mitch
Money making mitch, mo-mo-money making mitch
I take a zip and make it flip, I feel like money making mitch
Money making mitch, money making mitch
I’m in this bitch, I’m in this bitch I feel like money making mitch
Money making mitch, mo-mo-money making mitch
I take a zip and make it flip, I feel like money making mitch

[Verse 1: Giftz]
Swear I feel like Miss Fourteen bricks in a bag
Don’t tweak like Rico bitch you catch what’s in this mag
Whippin zips off this slab, twenty six and a half
I’m selling my work wet, couple hundred perhaps
Hit the hood with a jab, then pass it out
They like my chemistry prices she say they gon' cash me out
Stash my guap at her momma house
Keep a choppa' right by the couch
If a nigga want disrespect, they get hit she come bond me out
You hear them bitches spittin boy them llamas out
Pull up on them, big wheels, we brought them Tonkas out
They say he getting money, I’m that "he" they talkin bout
They ship them in, I break ‘em down, They taking bumps they breakin out
Niggas cross, we lay em down, robbed a plug to save a drought
She fucked my mans, can’t save her now
I fucked that bitch you date her now
Fuck that bitch I hate her now, show yall what this paper bout
Money making mitch I’m in this bitch, I brought them players out

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I’m on some real life murder shit
Thirty hoppers in my pocket, might burn a bitch
Just because I was serving shit with a onion
And my white goes for thirty six
That all white cocina mane, [?] gave me the game
Beat that hard like Marly Marl, my white comes like Gina mane
Dope house full of geekers mane
All black, black we creepin' mane, beat that hard like Marly Marl
My white comes like Gina mane
Gangsta Gibbs, east side
Anybody killer
Bitch my [?]; hit your body kill anybody with you
Let a nigga get swiss cheese, bitch please
Nigga wanna push ball, four, four out of window
I ain't got shit to lose in this bitch
Not a thing to prove this shit, bitch I play to fool but not play to fool and that nigga do me like this
Nigga I play the cool, stay straight to show and get it
They try hit the kitchen remix, tell ‘em to afford to get ‘em
Gangsta Gibbs!

[Verse 3: Giftz]
How say I gonna be …
Got that bag and we’ll be swaging, keep that bumping, he’s a rapper

Bought my bitch a platinum necklace
All these racks in my crib, they thought I got a platinum record

Twenty … I got some stressing …say honey for …
Police on my ass ...never tell ‘em shit  until my lawyer tell me different
… thirty flip I had to fell it
They say your best friends got nailed, no I’m steel grilling

Tell you one thing ‘bout me, yeah you right motherfucker making money is me
