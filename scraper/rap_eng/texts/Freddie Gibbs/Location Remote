[Intro: Curren$y]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
East side, laboratory coats, testing the dope
I'm in a location remote, Ivory Coast
Tryna get high as I can go, the glass ceiling broke
Its never over, sole controller, all our chains golder
Diamonds brighter, you ain't gotta ask whose live-r
Niggas dyin' to be like us, losin' they minds tryin'
I'm in the basement scrapin' blades with all my sharpenin' irons
'Cause in times of peace that's when these snake niggas creep
You think you safe cuz you deep, your goonies half sleep
Stooges if you ask me
Gibbs and Andretti fill that vault full of Fetti
Andretti and Gibbs that's like that barrel to your rib
It's that fucking real (Yup)

[Interlude: Freddie Gibbs & Curren$y]
Yeah
Eastside
Eastside, nigga fuck the peace sign
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Ayy yo
Call the chiropractor, this necklace is extra heavy on me
1963 Gold Ds, I went Andretti on it
Dipped the shoes in 24 karats and dropped a Chevy on it
Boss, fuck a franchise tag, niggas can't Le'Veon me
Yeah, 'cause of a bitch I had to sit the bench
L train blessed me you broke me off when I hit the bricks
Passing off the dog bitch I scored the dope and I get assist
Kidnapping IG trapping might get your sister hit
We taping mamas up, we filling them llamas up
Niggas making statements they Manafort Papadopoulos
Trump sweating bullets on Diet Coke sniffing powder up
And if he build the wall we gone bring that dope underground with us
Told my nigga Spitta your enemies my enemies
I just solar powered up the Model X
Real nigga keep same energy, like what
I rep the pack like I'm Stunna Man
Legend in this bitch, might do Coachella as a hologram, nigga

[Outro]
That is just exactly what they want you to believe
Let's just call it the phenomena
He outranks them
He, he outranks them
Sit down
I don't wanna sit, I want my money
