[Verse One: ZZ Ward]
It’s three AM, got my eyes wide shut
I toss and turn, got the sheets untucked
You broke right in, yeah, you stole, you took
Left dirty fingerprints, you no-good crook
You shattered my heart like a Tiffany glass
I knew from the start he was a thief in a mask
And now I’m alone, cleaning up his mess, there ain’t nothing left

[Hook: ZZ Ward]
He’s just a criminal, he’s just a criminal
I can’t get back what he stole, he’s just a criminal
Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no, ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no
Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no, ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no

[Verse Two: ZZ Ward]
I hear the rain on this old tin roof
The rusty nails in the boards coming loose
Spend my last two dollars on you
You robbed me blind and you left no proof
Poof, poof, mmm, disappear
You should be sentenced for a thousand years
You should pay me back for a thousand tears, ya salty

[Hook: ZZ Ward]
He’s just a criminal, he’s just a criminal
I can’t get back what he stole, he’s just a criminal
Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no, ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no
Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no, ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no

[Bridge]
Ya salty, ooh, ya salty, ooh
Ya salty, ooh, ya salty, ooh

[Verse Three: Freddie Gibbs]
Uh, jet black coupe, I’m fresh out the projects
And I can’t peel off my block right now, I ain’t twist my cigar yet
These police might object to me flossing these fancy objects
Black diamonds on the dough boy proceed to speed up my progress
All kinds of hoes want to claim us, lifestyles of the thugged out and famous
And my mom said don’t talk to strangers so I went to the block with them bangers
On the street, twisting fingers, talk that slang with the slangers
Still pack my piece a piece a change, it won’t change us
We just some motherfucking criminals, yeah

[Hook: ZZ Ward]
He’s just a criminal, he’s just a criminal
I can’t get back what he stole, he’s just a criminal
Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no, ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no
Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no, ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no

[Bridge]
Ya salty, ooh, ya salty, ooh
Ya salty, ooh, ya salty, ooh
