[Verse 1]
Lay it down, bitch
Bitch, lay it down
Straight to the cake
Take it to the face
Boy, don't make a sound
Got a K for the fake
Case full of weight
Thug nigga 'bout my peso
All-black with the strap
Cup full of Ac
Y'all niggas sip that Karo
I’m blowed than a motherfucker
Million dollars in, bitch I'm on like a motherfucker
Smoking strong like a motherfucker
Vice Lord, Folk, Black Stones in this motherfucker
From the land of the gangbang
Neutrons get crossed out, niggas can't hang
Better watch what you say, mane
Ten, eleven phones and they all running cocaine

[Bridge x2]
I be with them killers, bitch
I be with them drillers, nigga
Certified drug dealer, bitch
I be with them powder flippas
Straight water whippas
Thug to the judge, free all my niggas
Said can you picture
Black mask on that ass, choppa split ya

[Pre-Hook x4]
Lay it down, bitch
Bitch, lay it down

[Hook x4]
I be with them killers, bitch
I be with them drillers, nigga

[Verse 2]
Lay it down, bitch
Lay it down, ho
You niggas ain’t 'bout it
Nothing but a dollar on my line, ho
If a nigga wasn’t rapping
Nigga be trapping out of a 'bando
If you niggas want static
Fully automatic, yeah that’s Bando
Still whipping up the dough, mane
G.I. nigga got slugs for the snow, mane
Freddie G no ho, mane
Mr. lay a motherfucker down on the flo', mane
Thirty-six for the tha-yang
Neutrons get crossed out, niggas can't hang
Better watch what you say, mane
Hundred niggas with me and they all on the same thang
