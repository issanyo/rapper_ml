[Hook x8]
Hanging, mobbing, posted up, chillin

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Man life ain't no fairytale you better learn that very well
If you go to jail it's no calls on the celly-cell
Before me, there was a rapper named Melly mel
After him, it was a rapper named Elly L
My nigga doing 8 years with no baily bail
He won't get to see his daughter till she barely twelve
Cold game, I be pricing them gold rings
I went in for a charm and came back with the whole thing
No games call me by my codename
Clayton Crenshaw then re-runs of soul train
Propane, chop hoes like lo mein
I know some cute thick white girls in Spokane
Hanging, mobbing, posted up, chillin
Dranking, robbing, smoking, or killin
Banging, squabbing, most of 'em children
That's five little niggas in the front of every building

[Hook x8]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Muthafucka I be hanging, mobbin
Fingers twisted gang banging, robbin
Stick up at the gas station or two elevens at the liquor store
Ask them Popo bout that gangsta Gibbs bet them niggas know
Serving dope with dope man nikes on
Never trust a bitch that's why I fuck with the lights on
Tryna justify the way I live but it's quite wrong
Headed for the clink, won't sleep a wink 'til this white gone
Swishers to the face in Granny's basement that's the chill spot
Bought a pound from Ray on thirty three now that's the kill spot
So I say we mass up on niggas and go take it all
Got me shaking yay around my way cause that's the way we ball
Serving is a ritual, drug scale digital
Niggas shot the Chevy up and missed me but my homie off in critical
So I guess these niggas get wet cause I ain't finished
I go out to be a straight up menace and I be hanging
