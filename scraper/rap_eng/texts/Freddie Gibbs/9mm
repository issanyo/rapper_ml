[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Wa da da dang, wa da da da da dang
Listen to my 9-millimeter go bang
Niggas hustle, niggas murder for this dope and cocaine
If I'm out here doing bad, I'm knocking down your door, mane
Shit, our scene might leave you terrified
That's why my 9-millimeter stay by my bedside
Got partners locked up up-state, some partners on fed time
Shoot first and ask questions later, boy you ain't never dying, ain't never dying
Wa da da dang, wa da da da da dang
Listen to my my 9-millimeter go bang
How I take a nigga's life like it's all right, it's so strange
Put your family in the trunk, man, it's a very cold game
Shit, our scene might leave you terrified
That's why my 9-millimeter stay by my bedside
Got partners locked up up-state, some partners on fed time
Shoot first and ask questions later, boy you ain't never dying, ain't never dying

[Hook x4: Freddie Gibbs]
Wa da da dang, wa da da da da dang
Listen to my 9-millimeter go bang

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Wa da da dang, wa da da da dang
Listen to my 9-millimeter split your brain
Bullets hit you and whistle past you
Bitch niggas and the police harass you
If you came up quick with a flip, hit a motherfucking lick, how long will it last you?
Lord, rinse my soul clean
I start my day off with Ocean Spray and promethazine
Used to roll them stogies, get blowed, and sprinkle shit in my green
Straight thugged out, dubbed out, had yo mama ride in that limousine, that limousine
Nigga fuck all my enemies, bitch I'll see y'all in hell
Better put five bullets in my dome, punk bitch, I bail, all is well
Unzip that package, it's that Cali, we can tell by the smell
Got black ski masks, rob for practice, sell that shit by the barrel
That silence'll make a whisper my sweet 9-millimeter
And I know these police is listening, gotta throw away my Nokia
If you need me then chirp, money, macking, and murder
Black mask, black gloves, black shirt in the day light, bitch I'm out here working

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]

[Verse 3: G.I. Fleezy]
My nigga, we killas, we ready for everything, trained for it all
Play your position, object and identify, when your time is called
No wonder we only gon' do it the G way and kill 'em all
Cause I don't know no other way, and them bitches know my face
So I can't wait, let me get a taste, and I hate
When niggas be actin like hoes, and bitches be actin the ???
And I don't give a fuck, have to open you up, two to the head and one to the gut
When I'm with my niggas we thinking 'bout crimes, dropping dope out on these lines
Send 'em back up to get the next one, if I got a gun, somebody gon' cry

[Verse 4: G-Wiz]
Yelling bloody murder, froze, eyes closed fo we hit the street
Could it be? Motherfucker tryna play me shyfe off some jealousy
Rapid fire hellishly, meet up with your maker
Know that karma might catch up to me, for what I did to get this paper
Lord forgive me I'm red rum sipping, grim reaper
Drug smoking, magazine loading, straight slamming and scheming
Block boy, with a short barrel that'll leave a nigga leaking
Eyes on the muddy sparrow 'til we eating, it's the season to let it rain

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
