[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
All my gangstas hit the flo'
For some gangsta music

They don't really wanna test my gangsta
They don't really wanna test my gangsta
Nah, I don't think they wanna test my gangsta (oh)
I don't think they wanna test our gangsta (oh)
I don't think they wanna test my gangsta (oh)
Nah, they don't (oh)

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
They say this boy too gangsta for the radio
But I'm such a hot commodity, I bet your favorite station still play me though
Because I spit well, I need to stop, drop, and roll
I'm a man on fire like Denzel
All hail, this young cat, rap, I run that
Hustle hard, i done that, makin' my funds stacks
Stay away from dumb cats, they get you stung black
You gon' wonder where yo' lungs at when that *scratch* clap
If it's wack, I don't bump that
I like that gangsta music, and I'm tired of all this bubblegum rap
Cause ain't nothin' fake about how I'm livin', homie I'm real wit' it
You don't like the way that I'm spittin'? Then come and deal wit' it
Chill wit' it, you better keep yo' cool
Please don't be nobody's fool cause I keep my tool
I ain't quite like them other guys
If you ain't feelin' what I'm sayin' then you gotta be dumb, deaf, or paralyzed

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
They don't like the way I talk, I'm too gangsta
My style and the way that I walk, it's too gangsta
So they don't want me up in da club, I'm too gangsta
This for one for my thugs, show me some love
Aye, aye, aye, oh, I'm too gangsta
I'm too gangsta, I'm too gangsta
Too gangsta, too gangsta

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Verse 2, let's keep it goin', keep it poppin', keep it movin'
Keep it crackalackin', my gangstas keep groovin'
Keep it thorough, with or without my crew
And you don't do dat, dat's the difference between me and you
See me, I keep it gutta, keep it hood, keep it gangsta
You keep it lame, keep it fake, keep it wanksta
And you be rappin' 'bout things you never did
And makin' songs about a life you never lived
Your lyrics straight garbage when you spittin' 'em out
You should live in a trash can like Oscar the Grouch
Take it straight back to Sesame Street
Freddie be rippin' the beat, so on the mic you could never compete
Ah you lookin' kinda mad, what's the matter? It's a shame
I can see straight through you, I guess yo' daddy was a glassmaker
So sit there and try to figure it out, real Gs know what I'm talkin' about
Yup, keep it gangsta

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
They don't like the way I talk, I'm too gangsta
My style and the way that I walk, it's too gangsta
So they don't want me up in da club, I'm too gangsta
This for one for my thugs, show me some love
Aye, aye, aye, oh, I'm too gangsta
I'm too gangsta, I'm too gangsta
Too gangsta, too gangsta

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Homie, I went from ashy to nasty to classy
And these honeys on my jock used to look past me
Now they breakin' they neck to sexually harass me
Then they man find out and wanna come blast me
But I ain't worried 'bout it (I ain't worried 'bout it)
Cause I got way bigger fish to fry
I want my slice of the pie befo' it's time to die
It ain't hard for me to catch yo' eye
People say I'm so gangsta and wonder why I dress so fly
You ain't know? I'm in the polo, fresh air forces
Tall, dark, and handsome, man, I'm so gorgeous
Rocks in my Jacob watch is so flawless
Rappin' or grindin', I'm gettin' mine regardless
I'm the illest, you can claim to be the hardest
Cause I'mma be eatin' while y'all dudes is still starvin'
Beggin' for yo' turn like a busta
Yo' careers over, gon' and let it burn like Usher

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
They don't like the way I talk, I'm too gangsta
My style and the way that I walk, it's too gangsta
So they don't want me up in da club, I'm too gangsta
This for one for my thugs, show me some love
Aye, aye, aye, oh, I'm too gangsta
I'm too gangsta, I'm too gangsta
Too gangsta, too gangsta

[Outro]
