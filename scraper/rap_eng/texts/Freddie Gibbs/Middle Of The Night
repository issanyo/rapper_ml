[Hook - Wayne Blazed & (Freddie Gibbs)]
In the middle, in the middle of the night
Why you laying down sleeping
I'mma wake you up with it, in the middle of the night
Baby I ain't trying to hold you
I just wanna bend it over, in the middle of the night
(What you wanna do, how you wanna do it)
In the middle of the night
(What you wanna do, how you wanna do it)

[Verse 1 - Freddie Gibbs]
What you wanna do, how you wanna do that
Black and gold Trojans, we been runnin' through that
Rolling down the pole, love the way she move that
Tryin to bend it over you already knew that
Hit you with the dope never been the one to sugar coat
Girl I'm tryin to pope that's the real shit I ever saw
Loving what you wearin' but I'd rather see you naked though
Work it cause I know you're a professional
Shit zip tight, hit me after work I know you want in midnight
I still be up you call my phone you're tryin to get right
You know that pussy so amazin, type a shit that make a nigga chase it
And I'm blowing up the phone in the day time
Tryin to Skype while fucking you on face time
But that ain't me I keep the G you never break mine
I just need a little time, girl you're mine break the spine
In the middle of the night

[Verse 2 - Freddie Gibbs]
Uh yeah, lot of shows, lot of freak hoes
And they names and locations can't repeat those
Strictly cause I can't remember how to delete those
She ain't got a pendy but you busy in the sheets though
Baby got a baby but she strictly independent
Some people say she crazy but I swear this bitch is with it
Got me cuttin off my old bitches and man I'm talking bout some cold bitches
See him in the act like I don't know bitch face down
Ass up, that's the way you like it
And I ain't try to wife it, but I'm all night it
Some bitches at the all star and they was all thankful
I'm tryin the shit they never did I bet they all like it
But I rather have you on deck
And time and commitment know you want that
I'm tryin let you with this gangs and we baby can you fuck with it
I'mma wake you up with it in the middle of the night

[Bridge - Wayne Blazed]
The way you layin' there naked you
All that i can think about is sexin' you
I know you gotta go to work
But baby let me go to work
You see i love when ya moanin'
Then you turn around and you look at me
Oh, you put it on me

[Hook]
