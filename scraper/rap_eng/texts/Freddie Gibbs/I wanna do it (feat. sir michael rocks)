Feat. Sir Michael Rocks

(Intro)
The world's freshest new bitch
S'up, yeah, yah
You know I wanna do it
You know I wanna do it
You know I wanna do it

(Verse)
I wanna bust it open in the mornin'
Like presents on Christmas, the dick is all she wanted
Ain't none like them freaky bitches from California
That couchie deucing, thumb in the booty, when I'm bonin'
That from the back that show you how sexy the lot can share
Came from the Valley, and she know that that's a resume
Matter fact, something and spend some rocks on that
Freshly pack the magnets, keep them ratchets out my habits
Damn, if I am used the shit, I wanna do it
Bitch, I'm jammin' with the quick, so quick some niggas shout
So gone and get to it, don't ask permission to it
And I think I'm feeling yo pencil, let's pull a switcheroo
Fucking nooses boarded up too, I could go back three or four
Who I shit is who I want to, shut yo lip, cause that's fo' me know
I need it tho, some green to blow
Bitch come fuck yo check, I feen a feenis', don't be fuckin' wid it
Gangsta bitch

(Hook)
You know I wanna do it
You know I wanna do it
You know I wanna do it
You know I wanna do it
You know I wanna do it
You know I wanna do it

(Verse)
Yeah, I wanna fuck her in the afternoon
My bitch babysit, we fuck in the family bit
Bitch, I'm in the mood, so take that lil' fool to school
It's polo jaws on my balls, don't fuck with you tonight
In it that Versache fit, so cold we can up and bite
Hangcoating them monkeys, bitch, you ain't shoppin' right
Forgeries on my custom tight, been purple barred with ice
Clean on them hunkeys, bitch, you monkey, I'mma start tonight
So make yo wish bitch, I'll straight the nit, bitch
Whip one 3.5 to 36, now that's a brick, bitch
Now make a wish bitch, I'm straight to dip bitch
Whip one 3.5 to 36, now that's a brick, bitch

(Hook)
You know I wanna do it
You know I wanna do it
You know I wanna do it
You know I wanna do it
You know I wanna do it
You know I wanna do it

(Verse)
So if you see me with trip, you know I just hit the jog
You wanna shine with a nigga, I think you definitely should
Cause when I step in the set, I fuck yo rep in the hood
But I got a rep to bet, I pull the Tech on a muc
A real asshole, badboy, I don't play sports
The type of guy make your thighs get a divorce
That's right, anytime of the day you down for the ride
I'm findin' a way, rain, sleet, hail, snow, no job in the way
Look, homie, I stay hustlin' and toll takin'
These bitch niggas, I can't fell them
I can't imagine that type of life you livin'
Ain't no champagne where you sittin'
Ain't a damn thing on yo body fittin'
You watchin' Twilight, nigga, but all the thotties that you ain't gettin'
I don't give a fuck
