[Intro]
Blood gushing, I think I hear sirens
Uh, yo kill the motherfucker, kill him right, man (Scarface)
Do the shit point blank, nigga, yeah
Don't muh'fuckin freeze (that's how you do a murder right)
Uh, yeah (we gon' have a muh'fuckin murder 187, nigga)

[Verse]
Chiefing on that, think I hear my heart beat
Smoking, got me rolling stogies on a dark street
Let's jack this nigga cause he got some shit we can't afford
Another day in Gary, 'nother couple niggas in the morgue
He got the beating, his weed crumbs on plush seats
Niggas wanna hate, they get yellow tape'd and white sheets
And he steady talking, my chopper, he gonna let it rip
All the bullets that got my name on 'em still in the clip
Life's a bitch, I was a virgin, hope she let me fuck
Pray I miss before a nigga bust his last nut
Homie '84 got the same rims that mine had
Freddie jumped up in it like freshman year with the dime bags
I started small time, dope game, cocaine
Pulling stick ups to the nigga from a no-name
Diamond bezel, went from pebbles to a whole thing
Now them punk detectives in my section know my whole name
Gibbs, nigga

[Interlude]
Nothing wrong 'bout that motherfucking point blank murder, nigga
Muh'fuckin armed robbery, nigga, what you know about that?
Muh'fuckin strong arm shit, nigga, A100
Know what I'm saying, bitch?
Been there, done it, you know what I'm saying, goddammit?
Muh'fuckin ski mask, you know, what you know about that?
Muh'fuckin duct tape to a nigga face, nigga
You know what I'm saying? That's real shit
Muh'fuckin, putting hoes on the muh'fuckin ground, nigga
Whole families, nigga, kids, everything goddammit
Grandma, uncle, cousin, er'rybody on the goddamn floor, bitch
Uh, yeah, slime

[Outro]
And all the gangbusters and facts that show
The operation of our law enforcement officials
In their war against the underworld
Thinking about the swinging times and all
I'm gonna tell my children's children what life is all about
And hopefully they'll have just enough soul to figure it out
