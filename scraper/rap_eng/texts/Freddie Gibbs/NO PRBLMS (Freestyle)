And she know I'm the real and that will never change
You're fucking with a thug that's deep up in the game
I don't do nine to five I just work that cocaine
Thats why they call me cocaine (Kane)

Fucking with a vet I ain't no motherfucking rookie nigga
Bitches hit me with the fake charge had to cook a nigga
Lawyers on retainer, bail a million dollars booking nigga
Devil tried to take my fucking life
You know I shook it nigga

[Hook 2]
