[Hook:XV
Tell everybody that you know, you know
That I'm about to put my city on, city on
And I'm about to do it for me
Tell everybody that you know, you know
That I'm about to put my city on, city on
And I'm about to do it for me
You, me,you, me, you

[Verse One:XV]
From the city of great plains
And we make planes
So me planning to take off, fam, I can't change
People see when I'm in the spot like a damn stain
You know that I'm the answer, I suggest you keep your hand raised
Everything is digital and honestly I can't complain
Cause my spirits in lyrics and downloads you can't break
Soon as they try to down me, I re upload
The only thing I fear is somebody trying to leak my soul
I do this for me and you
And the art form that we uphold
All before the Butter like my first name was Leopold
Find a girl who's down, give her the crown soon as we be alone
And baby girls so fine if I was blind I'd still see her home
The man who raised me heard they play me on the radio
And we ain't talked in years
And he called me a day ago
And still I got some ways to go
But soon as I make it home

[Hook:XV]

[Verse Two: Freddie Gibbs]
Better save yourself cause you play yourself trying to play my position
See a lot of people came and went cause they came up in these conditions
When they came up on some cash became casualties of the system
Now that things on deck, now my homeboy be dialing me from the prison
It hurt me to go and see him, sometimes we be disagreeing
About how I'm living, but I just make it clear that I got my reasons
But all this slanging and beefing gonna get me stranded where he at
Or be a perfect candidate for a permanent place to sleep at
I be at places where niggas conceal they faces
Keep steal attached to they waists and blow kill to get through the day
Could get killed out here moving yay but I still maintain a crackers smile
But don't forget I'm a child straight from Gary, never backing down
They acting wild and running through my hood like they invincible
Youngins breaking codes against the streets and lost they principle
I stay upon my toes and let my haters stay miserable
I'm pretty close to perfect with the shit my pen and pencil do
I let them niggas know

[Hook:XV]

[Verse Three: Shawn Chrystopher]
Look
I'm on top like the numerator
And if you don't like it, then boy youse a hater
See, I stay uptown, I'm the new mayor
Giving you the best I got, no Anita Baker
See, life's about as fair as a street fight
I work hard everyday just to see Christ
At the end of what I'm doing then I'm proving
To be the greatest with no ring, Patrick Ewing
Uh, but my momma know
And now my ex is mad
Cause she believe 100% that rap was just a fad
Uh, but now every MC want to be me
When they see me on vac in countries that you see on TV
Uh, yeah, but they love me now
I'm all around the world
Take care of my little sis, like she my baby girl
I got the city on my back without a tattoo
I don't do it cause I want to, I do it cause I have to
