(Verse 1: Jay Worthy)
Get money, stack it up Stack it up
Come on lil' momma won't you back it up Back it up
Pussy ass nigga why you actin' tough Back it up
You don't really want it with a gang of bloods
Yawn off the juice yah I do say Do say
If the club 50 deep it's a movie Movie
? flip the top like a toupe troupe
Get money get paper like a loose lay Loose lay
Black top with the stars its a new wraith
Doing up in the club on a Tuesday Tuesday
Let the bitch on the blade if she choose it Choose it
5K that's the fee if she choose me Choose me
Know my pimpin' old school like a two way Two way
She fuck Cardo and G she a groupie Ok now
But she the finest little bitch I had ever seen Ok Now
Cardier frames and ? when I hit the city

(Chorus)
Don't put me off till tomorrow for what we can do today
Don't put me off till tomorrow tell me that you want to stay

(Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs)
Yah, Yah White body black top its a new coupe
Silly groupie, take the pee pee in the poop-chute
