[Verse 1]
The most perfect mistake I made
Rarely do I give it raw to any bitch I laid
But I did it whether love or lust it ain’t no thing
Just can’t wait for you see the light of day so I pick yo name
Watch you take yo first breath stumble and take yo first step
Speak yo first word, yes I’m so blessed
To be a part of something greater than me
Show you you can be anything you dedicated to be
Cuz I ain’t dedicate myself to nuttin’ but these streets
So this how we gotta eat from pills to green leaves
Rocks to white powder, butter to raise cheddar
Got the blood of a thug but you gon’ be raised better than that
And Allah know I’d be filled with joy
Whether he blessed me with a healthy girl or boy
I'mma praise you, even though it's hard to raise you in a world
A world so cold

[Hook]
It feels like I’m barely breathin’
And the blood in my veins so close to freezin’ my
Momma raised me but she couldn’t save me from a world
A world so cold
Cause when a nigga barely make it
He forget how to ask for shit he just take it
I can raise you but I can’t save you from a world
A world so cold

[Verse 2]
Yo I can keep it in a needle in a dope fiend vein
80s through the present seen the dope scene bang
Lookin’ at 80 years over 14 thangs
Momma prayin’ for a son with hopes that he change
Hope’s that he’ll get it together he make her nervous
Just the thought of her attending a child funeral service
What a horrifying sight to see
Not a healthy way of life but it’s the life for me
So now I gotta make life right for you or my life’s a waste
Me and yo Momma argue everytime she she my face
She beggin me to settle down but I don’t play like that
A rollin’ stone so my home’s where I lay my hat
You know I get right back
I ain’t husband material so I don’t spend my time like I spend my
Scratch
But I’mma clothe you, feed you, never gon’ leave you in a world
A world so cold

[Hook]
It feels like I’m barely breathin’
And the blood in my veins so close to freezin’ my
Momma raised me but she couldn’t save me from a world
A world so cold
Cause when a nigga barely make it
He forget how to ask for shit he just take it
I can raise you but I can’t save you from a world
A world so cold

[Verse 3]
She’s seven months you gon' be here in a lil’ bit
Move yo momma in, got the colors for ya room picked
Baby shower, baby shoes, all type of new shit
Sideline hoes I don’t want nuttin’ to do wit
How can I play y’all while I watch her carry you around
I got excited from pictures of your ultrasound
She told me I'mma have a son and I’m the one
And she at the doctor’s office for a visit, can I come
Dead Silence, News got it dead in the room
Pregnancy complications left you dead in the womb
Maybe I take the blame God punish me for old sins
The tears hit me when I think of what you could have been
I flame jane try to smoke away the pain
But I know the bond that we made wasn’t in vain
Could have been my little Freddie
But I guess you wasn’t ready for a world
A world so cold

[Hook]
It feels like I’m barely breathin’
And the blood in my veins so close to freezin’ my
Momma raised me but she couldn’t save me from a world
A world so cold
Cause when a nigga barely make it
He forget how to ask for shit he just take it
I can raise you but I can’t save you from a world
A world so cold
