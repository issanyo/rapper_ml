[Intro]
Tokin’ on some good green, pouring up the purple
Tokin’ on some good green, pouring up the purple
Tokin’ on some good green, pouring up the purple
Tokin’ on some good green, pouring up the purple
And you know it… yeah
And you know it… yeah
And you know it… yeah
And you know it… yeah

[Verse 1]
Man I know that you smoking
I know that you rolling
On that dirty sprite with ice, you know that good purple potion
I wrote this shit for my homies who checked out before me
I blow this doja, smoke away, ‘cause every day we be on it
And you know it – crack a seal, pop a pill
Now we rolling – drop my top, grip the wheel
I’m slow motion – stack a hundred dollar bills
I can’t fold it, nah – I can’t fold it, yea
And yo, I hope you know that I’m thuggin’
Hope you know that I’m rollin’ dope
Styrofoams stay muddy, pourin’ up ‘til I overdose
Only smokin’ on Woods
We don’t fuck with them Swisher Sweets
Only mess with them body bitches
Them bougie bitches don’t interest me
Hope she know she gon’ get it
Hope she know she gon’ give it up
Say she stay with a nigga
Hope she know I don’t give a fuck
Know I stay with that pack
Sixteen of that thrax
Throw it up as we blow it up
And blow big dope in that ‘Lac

[Hook]
And you know it… yeah
And you know it… yeah
And you know it… yeah
And I hope you know what's up
‘Cause we smokin’ purple up
And you know it… yeah
And you know it… yeah
And you know it… yeah
And I hope you know what's up
‘Cause we smokin’ purple up

[Verse 2]
Eyes hella red, got my thing from California
Stepped out LAX and got some more head in the Rover
She choose to do the usual with a pimp ‘cause I was chosen
That purple pineapple fan and now my Styrofoam is golden
This one here for my niggas, promethazine sippers
The Sprite to the Ocean Spray, I ain’t really trippin’ on the mix, I’m with it
This one here for my niggas, Lord knows I love my niggas
Hoes down and the real G’s up
I’mma pour another cup ‘til I’m up there with ya
Cause I know, I know, I know…

[Outro]
And I know that you smoke
I know that you rolling
On that dirty sprite with ice, you know that good purple potion
I wrote this shit for my homies who checked out before me
I blow this doja, smoke away, ‘cause every day we be on it
I said, I know that you smoke
I know that you rolling
On that dirty sprite with ice, you know that good purple potion
I wrote this shit for my homies who checked out before me
I blow this doja, smoke away ‘cause every day we be on it
