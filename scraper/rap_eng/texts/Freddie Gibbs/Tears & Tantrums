[Chorus]
I'm just tryna dance my troubles away
Throw up my problems like money
But I can't stop crying on the dancefloor
No, I can't stop crying on the dancefloor
I'm just tryna move, but you're in my way
Everywhere I look, I see your face
No, I can't stop crying on the dancefloor
No, I can't control these tears and tantrums

[Verse 1]
I've been crying all night
Good God, I guess the boy of my dreams ain't right
Thought I'd love him for life, oh
I didn't wanna leave home
My girls hit me up on my phone like "no"
It's a Saturday night, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can almost see you in the strobe lights
Come on, tell me you're sorry
But you're not

[Chorus]
So I'm just tryna dance my troubles away
Throw up my problems like money
But I can't stop crying on the dancefloor
No, I can't stop crying on the dancefloor
I'm just tryna move, but you're in my way
Everywhere I look, I see your face
No, I can't stop crying on the dancefloor
No, I can't control these tears and tantrums

[Verse 2]
I just [?]
Good God, they're tryna stop me but it's way too late
I won't know when I'm done, oh
You know I hate feeling like this
I work myself into a state, I'm a right mess
No, I'm not drinking for fun, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I can almost see you in the strobe lights
I think I've had one too many

[Chorus]
So I'm just tryna dance my troubles away
Throw up my problems like money
But I can't stop crying on the dancefloor
No, I can't stop crying on the dancefloor
I'm just tryna move, but you're in my way
Everywhere I look, I see your face
No, I can't stop crying on the dancefloor
No, I can't control these tears and tantrums
No, I can't control these tears and tantrums

[Bridge]
My tears keep on falling down
When I see you there in the crowd
These tears keep on falling for you

[Chorus]
So I'm just tryna dance my troubles away
Throw up my problems like money
But I can't stop crying on the dancefloor
No, I can't stop crying on the dancefloor
I'm just tryna move, but you're in my way
Everywhere I look, I see your face
No, I can't stop crying on the dancefloor
No, I can't control these tears and tantrums
No, I can't control these tears and tantrums

[Outro]
No, I can't control these
No, I can't control these
No, I can't control these
No, I can't control these tears and tantrums
No, I can't control these
No, I can't control these
No, I can't control these
No, I can't control these tears and tantrums
