[Verse 1]
How you wrong when your money long
Out the gym with a lot of strong
Nigga started from a fuckin' zone
Chopped it up and put my niggas on
But ain't nobody put a nigga on
Glock-9 put a nigga on
Two squares gotta get em gone
Hard, soft, chicken talk on the telephone

[Bridge]
And I got em for the way low
I stay low
The bricks or the bow wow
The yayo
You niggas better stay low
Like way low
For the bricks or the bow wow
The yayo
For the Pesos

[Hook]
Fuck nigga
I got 10 bitches and all of em turnt out
Fuck nigga
10 blunt rotation and all of em burnt out
Fuck nigga
10 pack of yay, on the way, it just touched down
Fuck nigga
Hit me before 10 o-clock my shit shut down

[Verse 2]
Tom Brady with the touchdown
Fuck nigga play with me and get fucked 'round
The postman bring the package out the truck now
A thousand pounds worth a milli when it touch down
New seats in the dome got it plushed out
Remember when my shit went racket then it rust out
Hoes used to laugh at the bus stop
Now I got all these bitches assed and their titties bout to bust out
Got em like yeah
Fuck nigga
I got 10 bitches and all them obedient
My hoes ride Porches and Benzes and Beemers shit
Freakin' your bitch in my suite, who you sleepin' with
Still with the dogs I was thuggin' and thieving with
Since '96 on some payphone and beeper shit
Used to get hoes on some  payphone and beeper shit
Freakin' your bitch in my suite, who you sleepin' with

[Bridge]
Way low
I stay low
The bricks or the bow wow
The yayo
You niggas better stay low
Like way low
For the bricks or the bow wow
The yayo
For the Pesos

[Hook]
Fuck nigga
I got 10 bitches and all of em turnt out
Fuck nigga
10 blunt rotation and all of em burnt out
Fuck nigga
10 pack of yay on the way, it just touched down
Fuck nigga
