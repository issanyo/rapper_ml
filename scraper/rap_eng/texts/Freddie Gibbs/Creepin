Came down creepin through the hood
With a cup fulla dirty, and a blunt fulla good
Came down creepin through the hood
With a cup fulla dirty, and a blunt fulla good
Like whoooa whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoooooa whoooa whoa
Everbody say whoooa whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoooooa whoooa whoa

[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
Well a lil nigga ridin' shotty
Black tee crisp
Ballin like muhfuckin' athlete bitch
Niggas already know homie don't play that
Niggas already know don't ask me shit
Club Wiley takin' pictures wit a buncha bitches
And the swishers, I bet they go down
If they ain't know then
Bet them niggas know now
With a big fat steak, niggas finna throw down
I'm fine
I'm fine you ain't really gotta worry bout the kid
And all my money legal as shit
So I ain't really worried bout no bid
Real nigga say word, never told no lie
You ain't really hood, never sold no pies
And I'm fried than a bitch with the homies wilin'
Hittin 85 flyin down Stony Island

[Bridge]
Highs and lows
Every single day its highs and lows
Every single day my eyes is low
Cause every single day I grind for dough
Grind grind for dough

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I bet'chu they bury me, smilin' in my fuckin casket
I bet I see all of my haters in hell and start to blast 'em
From the projects where the dope checks so you know I cashed 'em
Strapped wit a vest, and I just might go next
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust I'm rich and I'm young as fuck
A nigga deliverin' them cakes Dominican nature that Hummer truck
Yeah that was back in '08, since then I been straight off this rappin' shit
You know I still got that weight put it on yo plate, 35 a brick
Servin' in clean shirts, nothin' but dirty work
Livin' everyday like my birthday, it's clucka' day on the first
Muhfucka don't want no gunplay, fuck around and get burnt
When I step off in yo function you know that bitch gon' get turnt
You know them biches gon' choose, 'Sace, Fendi, Gucci down to my shoes
My foreign on Forgiatos I give these niggas the blues
Don't shy away from no drama, put yo ass on the news
Channel 2, channel 9. On tha 5, ride or die
Gangsta Gibbs
