[Freddie Gibbs]
You trying to fuck with a nigga?
Shit, you gotta show me something
I’m only gonna be here...

Wait a minute, motherfucker

[Hook 1]
Now make it shake, make it pop, make it drop, make it roll
Bend it over, touch your toes, let me see that pussy hole
Now make it shake, make it pop, make it drop, make it roll
Bend it over, touch your toes, let me see that pussy hole

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I’m trying to take a bitch home
Hoes know what I’m on
Couple blunts to the dome and I’m in that zone
Nigga, and my Hennessy bottle is almost gone
Got a clean boxframe outside on chrome
Woah, girl, I know you wanna roll with a nigga
Smoke something and blow a little dough with a nigga
But I don’t trip for no bitch, I give a shit
Nigga, bussdown your whole click
Cause I’m a pimp that don’t slip
I’m only in town for one night
I ain’t looking for a wife
I’m looking to lay the pipe
I’m looking to blow another bitch back out
Fuck up her hair weave and pull a couple tracks out

[Hook 2A: Freddie Gibbs]
I got the yack by the fifth, got weed by the pound
So a groupie bitch is all a nigga need when I come around
Cause I only got one night in town
And I know that you down to bussdown
Down to bussdown
Yo, I could peep a little mama for a minute
And she thick with it, she need to go on, let a nigga hit it
Cause I only got one night in town and I know that you down to bussdown
Down to bussdown

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I got a main chick, a mistress and a young bitch
Plus a ho to suck off every nigga that I run with
Got that fire head, guaranteed to make you cum quick
Once I put that ho on a stroll, I’mma be dumb-rich
Son of a bitch, that nigga Freddie about to run to your chick
You shoulda knew that when she hit me with the number and shit
She had me all up in your bedroom, watching a flick
Now I got your wife enticed to hop on the dick
Cause I’m a pimp, not a gigolo
All about my figures though
Gotta think about your cashflow when you dick a ho
You can ride with me, but you gotta fuck my nigga though
Me and bro’ll hit them in the studio

[Hook 2B: Freddie Gibbs]
A nigga got yack by the fifth, got weed by the pound
So a groupie bitch is all a nigga need when I come around
Cause I only got one night in town
And I know that you down to bussdown
Down to bussdown
Yo, I could peep a little mama for a minute
And she thick with it, she need to go on, let a nigga hit it
Cause I only got one night in town and I know that you down to bussdown
Down to bussdown

[Hook 1]

[Outro]
Yeah, (yeah) c’mon baby (c’mon baby)
Be real with yourself (Be real)
You know you wanna roll with a nigga
(You know you wanna roll with a motherfucker)
Got weed, a nigga got yack
What it do?
Yo, need a, I need a bussdown (Where the bussdowns at?)
Cause I only got one night in town
Where the bussdowns at?
