[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
DJ turn me up in the headphones a little bit
Aight, lettin' niggas know who it is, nigga
No Tamin' run it to 'em
This how we do it

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I'm gettin' tired of these naysayers, playa haters, and imitators
I'm blessed by the creator, I'm a fucking innovator
Niggas wanna see me heated, they nothin' but instigators
I just keep my temper down, as cool as refridgerators
Hear me know or hear me later
But sooner or later
You gon' have to deal wit' me
Homie keep it real wit' me
Do you want to battle rap?
Or do you want me to clap you?
With the bullets or the lyrics, I can handicap you
Leave you permanently leanin' like the tower of Pisa
You a cookie, your heart sweeter than Mother Theresa
You should get down on yo' knees and have a talk wit' Jesus
And pray to God you don't bump heads wit' Caesar
The black one, ready for action
Don't get me confused with other rappers, I am not the wack one
I don't rap for the platinum
I'm just tryna get my family outta the hood like Joseph Jackson
Now I got a little fame, it's hard to shake dames
I fuck these bitches and never remember their name
I'm the incredible, heterosexual, lyric professional
I flow perpetual, turnin' these rappers into vegetables

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
And if you thinkin' you better then think again
Cause I'm sicker with these similes, nouns, verbs, and synonyms
If you ain't feelin' Gibbs, then you ain't feelin' rap
You ain't ever felt real hip hop, you feelin' dat?

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs (chopped and screwed) + Freddie Gibbs]
It's Freddie G to the izz-I, B to the bizzy
S, oh yes the best rapper from the Gizzy
Ugh, yo what's my name homie?
Freddie Gangsta Gibbs nigga yeah
Bring it back
It's Freddie G to the izz-I, B to the bizzy
S, oh yes the best rapper from the Gizzy (nigga)
Yo what's my name homie?
Freddie Gangsta Gibbs nigga (ugh, yeah let's do it)

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Verse 2, time to show these muthafuckas what I'm made of
And give the industry somethin' that they afraid of
I got credibility, all my dudes is paid up
All you aspiring rap artists, getcha weight up
Y'all niggas spittin' elementary rhymes
Sellin' dope and wastin' yo' money on studio time
When I take a look at my city it brings me to laughter
Cause every other nigga that I meet is a rapper
Tryna get my money for his music
Say he got skill, but the nigga can't prove it
Seems like lyricism is long gone
Niggas scared for feature me on their shit cause I kill them on they own song
These other rappers don't write like me
So there'll never be an MC quite like me
And he can say that he's the hottest rapper out of the G
But you can be your bottom dollar he ain't hotter than me
Now I got a little rank, yo' career about to sank
Keep hatin', I'mma be laughin' all the way to the bank haha
I'm 'bout to make it I'm stripping the game naked
And you say you want the title? well homie step up and take it

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Woah, you still thinkin' you better? well think again
Cause I'm sicker with these similes, nouns, verbs, and synonyms
If you ain't feelin' Gibbs, then you ain't feelin' rap
You ain't ever felt real hip hop, you feelin' dat? nigga

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs (chopped and screwed) + Freddie Gibbs]
It's Freddie G to the izz-I, B to the bizzy
S, oh yes the best rapper from the Gizzy
Ugh, yo what's my name homie?
Freddie Gangsta Gibbs nigga yeah
Bring it back
It's Freddie G to the izz-I, B to the bizzy
S, oh yes the best rapper from the Gizzy (nigga)
Yo what's my name homie?
Freddie Gangsta Gibbs nigga (ugh, let's do it)

[Outro: DJ]
Yeah, y'all know who it is
Freddie Gibbs nigga
Full Metal Jackit Volume 2 niggas
You know what I'm sayin'?
It's that nigga John Doe aka DJ
For y'all niggas that don't muthafuckin' know this No Tamin' nigga
Holla at me
