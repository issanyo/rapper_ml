Rollin, pockets on Bruce Bruce by Louken
Coming from colors like fruit loops remove goose
Hoes right behind me in 2 groups they too loose
Balling on me running through niggas bitches that shoot hoops cruise
'93 magic blue on Shaq feet
Back like the bitch ran track ass like athletes
Tight up in them jeans so please swing that pass me
Finally got that ass bitch, striptease me last week
I guess I got the dick so I make the rules
When they let the mothernigga play the rules
Strapped up motherfucker better play cool
FNH 5.7, that's my favorite tool
I'm a fool dog ass nigga
So go play with your kids I'm a grown ass nigga bitch
I'm a fool dog ass nigga
So go play with your kids I'm a grown ass nigga bitch
It's all on me I put it on me
Until the day I die fuck hoes smoke tree
We bustin up the yak you and rollin OG
Got bottles under table the tab they 4G
And I put it on me, me, me
I put it on me ,me, me
Said It's all on me, me, me
I put it on me, me, me
Said I put it on me
Compton California that's where I'm from
Fuck your girl pussy until it's numb
Do my damn thing and I shake like I'm pimpin
Favorite state hate long as real niggas recognize
I'm good, yeah yeah I'm good
Taking care of my day ones and feeding on my wolf
2 365's ago I was live you know
Yeah I got off more tree than woods
Nigga its the real, ace of spades a deal
It ain't what you say it's how you say what you feel
I do it from the chest I reek of success
You ain't seen a nigga this cold out the West in a long time
Boy say you wanna problem it's a long line
Super hot boy push a cold line
Shawty starring at a gold mine
I'm on now, showtime
It's all on me I put it on me
Until the day I die fuck hoes smoke tree
We bustin up the yak you and rollin OG
Got bottles under table the tab they 4G
And I put it on me, me, me
I put it on me ,me, me
Said It's all on me, me, me
I put it on me, me, me
Said I put it on me
We smoking OG
I meet up with my nigga
We chopping the whole key
I slap it on a fire he slap it on a G
But yo that's still my folks be close since '93
Money over bitches running with my niggas
Hooting with the squad the robbers and dope dealers
Without these permissions I'm German the cold killers
Open on the streets don't got mercy on broke niggas
I'm thugging to the east bay and my nigga jack of 7
I'm on the freeway I need another pack of that
You know how beef lay hit a lick flip the zippers
I told the girl I'm just the type of nigga
Got my killer from the east bay
Hit the lay I got some weight to the 8th tray
You broke it down I hit my money at the next day
Hit a liquor flip the zippers
Told my girl I'm just the type of nigga
It's all on me I put it on me
Until the day I die fuck hoes smoke tree
We bustin up the yak you and rollin OG
Got bottles under table the tab they 4G
And I put it on me, me, me
I put it on me ,me, me
Said It's all on me, me, me
I put it on me, me, me
Said I put it on me
