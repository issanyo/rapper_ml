Freddie Gibbs, let these motherfuckers know what time it is

[Hook]
(I’m the man in – I’m the, I’m the)
Gibbs, ho (I’m the man in my city)
And you niggas know (I’m the man in – I’m the, I’m the)
That I’m out the east side of that G.I. (I’m the man in my city)
We don't die, we just multiply
Keep a full clip in my .45
I’m that dude, and I’m that guy (I’m the man in my city)
You niggas know (I’m the man in – I’m the, I’m the)
Hey bitches, Gibbs, ho (I’m the man in my city)
And you niggas know (I’m the man in – I’m the, I’m the)
That I’m out the east side of that G.I. (I’m the man in my city)
We don't die, we just multiply
Keep a full clip in my .45
I’m that dude, and I’m that guy (I’m the man in my city)

[Verse 1]
Haters say my swagger be rubbing niggas the wrong way
I don’t give a damn what the radio say, cause my records they gon' play
Off in the streets, and my niggas with the beat, got me banging up broadway
Go against me, roll a blunt, pack a lunch, cause you in for a long day (Okay)
Since the age of 19, I been crushing niggas’ rap dreams
Roll took me under his wing, I crushed the Gary rap scene
Fresh off and I took shit major
Show you niggas how to get that paper
Who the fuck being broke with a whole lot of friends?
You the man, if you got them haters
You can flow, but you ain’t no gangster
Talk about it but you ain’t gonna bust shit
Y’all niggas know me, FG
In the booth or the street man I can’t be fucked with
And a nigga gotta earn my plate
Cook real slow, never burn my cake
Jack that nigga if he’s herd that weight
Put you on the floor, t-shirt your face
All about the money and I just can’t wait
To make it to the top, I’mma take my place
With or without the deal, I’ve still got kill on deck so I’m gonna be straight
A nigga ‘bout to take what’s owed to me
Lock shit down like it’s supposed to be
Killing who ever opposes me
You niggas ain’t nothing but hoes to me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
(Bitch, what it do)
I’m the man in my city, I get land in my city
I be the one that the bitches be on and niggas can’t stand in my city (Nigga)
And part of the reason for that is most of these niggas be trying to rap
They hating on me cause they wack
Say what you want, cause I’m fine with that
Run up on me, and that iron’ll clap
Ghetto, cause I was designed for that
Raised in the G, so the R.E.S.P.E.C.T., I’m down for that
Don’t know what you doing for yours
Freddie ain’t stunting and fronting for whores
Until I go sit with the Lord
I’mma be living the shit I record
I’mma be living the shit that I spin
I go to work when I get on these beats
We don’t do the footwork, y’all niggas get hurt
Stomped in the club, nigga, watch my feet
Better yet, nigga, watch your bitch
Cause any minute, she gonna watch this dick
Straight nuts in her face, I’mma put it on tape
Motherfucker, you can watch this shit
And she gonna let my nigga Rock go on and hit
And she gonna let my nigga Jay buss her down
Big wheel ain't gon let the bitch hit the kill
We gonna send her straight back to your town
That’s how a nigga do his thang up in the G
Ain’t really worried about the nigga you claim to be
If you ain’t talking about the IN, then, then it really don’t pertain to me
You know it’s…
