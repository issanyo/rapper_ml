From the land of the cans of Spam, hand to hand
No deals made, dollar for dollar, gram for gram
Follow me and see just how much a man can stand
Before we go off the deep end
Come in your crib and creep in
Help us get home invaded
The hustlers they gon' get raided
Eventually, but for now they stay thuggin' and motivated
Misguided miseducated
We barely be graduated
And our lack of skills lead to some daily infatuations in the ghetto...
