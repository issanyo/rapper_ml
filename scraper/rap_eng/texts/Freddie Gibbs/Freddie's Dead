[Verse 1]
Yo so why you hesitating gun vibrating I see your hand shaking
If I was you and you was me I'd send that ass to satan
Niggas been waiting for me to check out
And I won't scream for help nor will I beg this bitch to live
Id rather kill myself
My life is fucked up
Thats why I stay liquored and drugged up
I really been trying to right my wrongs to make it this long I lucked up
My family think Im crazy I dunno who got my back
And some of my friends wouldn't give a fuck about me if I ain't rap
And thats for real
Only friend I got is Allah and I hope Allah forgive
All the ignorant things I did all the things that he forbids
Lost my innocence as a kid I was intelligent but refused to try
Didn't apply myself now me and my pops we don't see eye to eye
And who am I to say that I didn't flip or flat out lose it
If I die today then Gibbs gon’ live forever through my music
Classify me as black american youth that got mislead
Niggas feel me you can't kill me with two bullets to my head Freddie's dead

[Hook]
When I go out Im gon' out how I wanna go
What's in store for me after I go is what I wanna know
Send me to that other side trust me I ain't scared
Niggas feel me you can’t kill me with two bullets to my head Freddie's Dead

[Verse 2]
Happy birthday Gibbs made twenty-five
Alotta ya homies is dead or locked up but you still alive
You survived ya I'm truly blessed I can’t complain
Let me at least just say my peace before my conscious eats my brain
Spend my last piece of change get some shit to flip so I can eat
Did some treacherous things in life that really ain't right for me to repeat
Inherited other niggas beef cause they was scared to bust the heat
Put em on licks & hit em with chips I knew that bitch wouldn’t ride for me
So tell me what you got in mind for me I passed the gate I paid the toll
Take my freedom take my life but you can’t take my fucking soul
America sends me to death soon as a nigga came out the womb
Soon as a nigga came up and he got him some money they wanna see me in my tomb
There ain't no room for fear so I ain't fearing getting killed
When its time to go I go with the flow I know its Gods will
Classify me as a black american youth that got mislead
Niggas feel me you can’t kill me with two bullets to my head Freddie's dead

[Hook]
