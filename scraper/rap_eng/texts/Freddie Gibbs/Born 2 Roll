Tales of a nigga living in his momma basement
Listening to her bitchin' every morning it's the same shit
Time for me to get out on this corner make the 'caine flip
Post up at a nigga residence and we invasive
Knockin' at your door bitch, like I was maintenance, and you sprung leak
Heard you get pounds of that grape shit every other week
So my inclination to take shit at it's fucking peak
Stash and broke it down at the 7s go for a buck a piece
Cop a sweet, for a minute, swisha the optimal
Now I twist my shit in the woods, but I got that tropical
Some may say that I think illogical
Cause I still believe in God but down to dance with the devil to make a dolla' tho
I drop her, straight in the water, never bother
Serve anything other than hard, I keep it starvin'
Say she fuck with nothing other than ballers so I charmed her
We hit the mall right after I robbed her baby-father
The home wrecker, chrome leather and wood kiss
Keep my name hot in the hood and my dick in the hood bitch
Niggas violate we slice 'em and dice 'em like wood chips
Ho' we straight vanilla ice 'em and get on some shug shit
Came a nigga from 40 stories, Watch 'em drop that Wile E. Coyote
New in yo' hood but G all of them shotta niggas know me
Gangsta Gibbs from the guts never gave a fuck
Excuse me while I get my paper and my haters up
Yeah, my connect a 40, coppers get straight killed
Got the cash probably coppin' a whole field
We ain't shot the bitch, we dropped him, that's on the real
I was born to roll
