[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, know what I'm sayin'?
Som' smooth for the ladies you know
Bow Wow you get yo' tracks jacked too, you know what I'm sayin'?
You old enough
But, it's all good though you know
This dedicated to all the ladies, all the ladies that love Freddie
You know, I love y'all too, know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Bitch freeze, hell nah you ain't my main chick
I keep you sprung off dick because my game's sick
And every time you approach me it's the same shit
I'm settin' my mind frame, I ain't gon' change it
You think that I'mma go out and have a meal witchu
Or drive downstate just to chill witchu
Nah, I ain't gon' waste my gas
I'll take you to a restaurant so you can waste my cash
You'll be tellin' all ya friends that you think you in love with me
Just because I hit it and you smoked some bud with me
Yo' nigga said he saw you up in the club with me
And when he see me he gon' bust some slugs at me
But I ain't worried 'bout a thing, just break me off a lil bit of change
I'll slide wit' another dame
Cause Freddie don't go on dates wit' sluts
But we can pick another date to fuck, know what I'm sayin'? come on

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
I got a lot of bitches on my jock
They be callin' me around the clock
Oh Freddie
Freddie, Freddie can I be yo' girl?
Freddie can I be a part of yo' world?
Oh Freddie
I know they hate it when I run that game
But I love it when they say my name
Oh Freddie
Freddie, Freddie can I be yo' girl?
Freddie can I be a part of yo' world?
Oh Freddie

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I'm 6 foot 2, I weight about two-hundred pounds
Dark-skinned, pretty eyes and a nice white smile
But, don't let the pretty face fool you bitch
If you ain't hip to the game I'll school you bitch
I'm a rich woman's lover and a poor woman's dream
Plus I got a couple bad bitches on my team
Like Sheila, Maya, Brandy, Tisha, Jennifer, Mia, Candy, and Alicia
I got this chick name Honey, she a dime
I treat her wrong cause I don't respect her mind
Lotta niggas wanna hit it cause they know she a dime piece
Man, you should see all the shit she be buyin' me
Cause to keep me around ya gotta spoil me
Treat me like a king, rub my feet like I'm royalty
Cause if you do I might treat you the same
Nah I'm playin' bitch you know the game
I'm Freddie Gibbs nigga

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
I got a lot of bitches on my jock
They be callin' me around the clock
Oh Freddie
Freddie, Freddie can I be yo' girl?
Freddie can I be a part of yo' world?
Oh Freddie
I know they hate it when I run that game
But I love it when they say my name
Oh Freddie
Freddie, Freddie can I be yo' girl?
Freddie can I be a part of yo' world?
Oh Freddie

[Outro: Freddie Gibbs]
Oh, oh baby
Yeah, I know y'all love me out there (ooh-ooh)
Yeah, shit make me wanna sing on this mu-
You know what I'm sayin'? (ooh-ooh)
Nah I'm playin' haha
Yeah, like I said this dedicated to all the ladies that love Freddie
I love y'all too, know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't gon' show it, I ain't gon' act like it
But, you know, I do
