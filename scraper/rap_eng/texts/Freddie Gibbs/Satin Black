[Intro:]
I'm Freddie Kane man

[Verse 1:]
Yea, welcome to the Terrordome
California Love in '95, stuck in the desert nothin' but leather on
Got a million ways to get my cheddar on
Even when I'm locked up with three hots and a cot, my spot's sending letters home
100 pushups, 100 sit ups, everyday I get up
I hit the street in need, I get breakfast off what I whip up
I'm runnin' from police and they constantly tryna get us
My court date? I skipped it like scratching your favorite disser
I spend my whole life down on the ground and its time to live up
The 26's make it sit up, gotta lift my whip up
I'm wrappin' up a pack and rap circles around these amateurs
Can't hang with Freddie Kane on that stage, ain't got no stamina
I damage ya, straight wrecked out, shows stay packed out
All my cars is antique, it's satin blacked out
Old school more than your new school, I cashed out
Ridin' in that back seat passed out, I'm yak'd out

[Hook:]
Ridin' in my back seat, wind in my hair
Sun in my eyes but it don't really matter cause we don't really care
When the light hits the pane it shines till the sun creeps low
But it all goes when the smoke blows

[Verse 2:]
Cruisin' down the 110
Drop the top off my dunk and let my bald head hit the wind
As I take another sip of gin
Got two cold pieces driving me, I'm talking cold as Michigan
Got to get her cousins and her sisters in
They want that all star, all access, play with them rap vets
Been to every spot on your globe map or your atlas
Five star feet, walk on waves and won't get wet

[Outro:]
Yea, Gibbs and I won't get cursed
Straight wrecked out, shows stay packed out
Straight wrecked out, shows stay packed out
Old school more than your new school, I cashed out
Straight wrecked out, shows stay packed out
Old school more than your new school, I cashed out
