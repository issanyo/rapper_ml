[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
Now nigga, you dont wanna see me when my sack low
I keep them killers at your front and at yo back door
Layed on a stretcher when its pressure, man we bust thangs
Cause in the streets I claim, you gotta let ya nuts hang

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Caught in the cycle, black American psychopathic
And I can't do right, nigga, doing wrong is my rite of passage
Straight in the street life, I'm trying to interact with the 'matics
One hundred baggies all wrapped in plastic, I'm living savage
It's hot in these damn streets, shot this nigga last week
Police on my last nerve, I'mma gon' make this last serve
And hit 65 South and get low than a bitch
You see me back in the g, then that means I'm back on my dick
Back on that bullshit, full clip, don't play with a full deck
Hope my pack ain't caught up, it ain't made it to my hood yet
Did some niggas dirty, and I can't wait for the day they burn me
Cause I showed them hoes no mercy, Lord forgive me, I was thirsty

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Scrilla]
You don't wanna see me with that sack low
My name ain't Jody, but I'm coming through your back door
In all black, no mask, with a .45
And if this pussy buck a lick, then it's homicide
I'm from Zone 4 Atlanta, where these killers ride
Snatch a nigga out the car and take a nigga pride
And if we beefing in these streets, ain't nowhere you can hide
We kill a nigga, dump his body on 285
I'm getting tired of all these fuck niggas running around
Talking all that tough shit
Like you've been there and you've sold that
But in real life you don't run shit
My homie called me with a big lick
10,000 pills, about 10 bricks
I'm walking in with that big stick
Gonna lay it down with that dope dick

[Hook]
