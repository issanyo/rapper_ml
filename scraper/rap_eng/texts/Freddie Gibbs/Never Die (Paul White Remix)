[Intro: Eric Biddines]
You could change everything but everything
End up losing the most important things in life
Thinking you got all the game

[Verse 1: Eric Biddines]
Excuse my babble, I talk until I got lengthy
Certain topics get the best of my interest, don't mean I'm friendly
Running like a leaky faucet
See we toss it to the side, throw it in the closet
Very rare for me to lose my cool
We in a school full of stools
Sitting at a table dissecting these facts like they ain't true
Who told you you can get away with telling these lies?
Before you swallow oxygen look me in the eyes
Reflection in the mirror we don't recognize it
Paint a canvas in my image, put a frame around it
Don't even hang it cause I'm looking like "this supposed to be me?"
Analyzing every logistic, how can I fix it?
Changing everything but what I need help with
See now I'm trippin’
Now I'm fishing for a crack in the ceiling so I can ditch it
Rules golden like the mouth that I speak with to bite the tension
Count on me to let you down cause that's realistic, rules

[Hook]
I'll never die
I'll never die
I'll never die
Beneath the sky

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
My partner Rome just hit my phone for the stones, so slide through
Got a special going this week for them zones, so buy two
I got red in all my cars, they mistake me for Piru
But I move in the eastern water seas like my Chevy was dyed blue
Went back to California, dead broke and disgusting
Homeless without a dollar, but none of the records was buzzing
I played my shit one day for Kanye, hoping he fucking with something
And his response was something quite like "Mediocre, my brother"
That had me heated, though
But at the time didn't realize that's just what I needed though
Can't nothing fuck up my focus
I gotta get [?] fumes from the coke in our noses
Chrome rims, expensive jewels so these bitches would notice
Chrome rims, expensive jewels [?] some of these niggas would notice
Gotta buy guns and hit the artillery, they sending killers upon us
I give this game up for my wife and my daughter
25 to life helped [?] a nigga to get his life in order, yeah

[Hook]
I'll never die
I'll never die
I'll never die
Beneath the sky

[Verse 3: Yasiin Bey]
They say the chief of the tribe took a handsome bribe
Now his face is everywhere but he's hard to find
Super prime, on the grind, in the modern times
Gains from the game in exchange for a sober mind
And young’un you can hug the block, but it won't hug back
Until it do, and it squeeze and your spine go snap
Like feet chasing paper then his lungs just collapse
Ain't no freedom at the trap, it’s as simple as that
Pay a hater no mind, because that don't matter
Why whip slaves when you can just kill master?
But slave's getting brave to guard masters’ interests
They too shall feel it once we snap the clip in
So no threats only oaths, get well or catch hell
Shop open get dosed, medina hours baby, we never close
And how ever the banks go this balance don't broke
Salaam folks
