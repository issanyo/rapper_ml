Now you know damn god well, that I ain't did shit

Why you’re worried about this blunt?
Smoke, nope, I ain’t got no more on me
Theres cops pulling niggas over down here for nothing
So don’t even roll down the window wrong
Or you’d be sitting in that cell wishing your ass was at home
My girl was making dinner, too
Avocado, biscotto, tacos, tortilla soup
And I’m hungry as fuck too
