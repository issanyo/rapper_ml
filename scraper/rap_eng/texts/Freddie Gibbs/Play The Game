[Intro: Big KRIT]
Yeah, yeah
(sample) You, you ready
Big KRIT, pimpin'. Forever play the game
(sample) You, you ready
Yeah, we forever swangin' thangs
(sample) Statik Selektah
Grippin' wood grain. Yeah, right? I gotta do my thang
(sample) Live it up, fill the cup, make a toast
We gotta
(sample) Live it up, fill the cup, make a toast

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Unh, I remember way back we used to pray for scraps
Anything, guess you gotta pay for that
Wearin' bobo, no logos, I was hoping for Jords
Begged my pops for a pair, but we couldn't afford 'em
Cause the light's due
Playground jokes I fight through, might fight you
Cause I wanna be like Mike too
Waitin' on my chance to ball
Under my breath in the hall, I'm screamin', "Fuck all of y'all!"
Writing rhymes and lines that's dope, I'm bound to blow
If I take my time to find my flow
Mamma, Imma get us outta these projects, this complex
But if my lyrical content's vexed, I bomb next
And we ain't ever gonna want or need
Put it down from the 'sip to NYC
Then clean 'cross overseas
Passport stamps from places I never dreamed
Places I'd never seen, livin' like VIP

[Hook: Big KRIT]
Forever play the game
Forever swangin' thangs
Grippin' wood grain
Gotta do my thang
Ooh oh oh oh
(sample) Live it up, fill the cup, make a toast
Ooh oh oh oh
(sample) Live it up, fill the cup, make a toast
Ooh yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I remember way back, my first eigth of crack
Cut it up into pieces, did my thing with that
Youngin' with King Kong balls, got 63 raw stones
Pushin' keeping my paper right, but still it seem all wrong
Got some geekers that rather smoke it that buy the groceries
House full of kids with an empty fridge, how they gon' eat?
Meanwhile I'm ridin' on the sections while they stomachs touch their back
And all the shit I sell their mother got their family structure fractured, got 'em broken up
Boulders in my pocket when I'm anew woken up
Tryna turn this quarter ounce of rock to a Rover truck
Bitch, this ain't no Cinderella story, glass slipper glass deep
Tryna chase the last hit
Last high, when I die, lord let me pass by
Or relinquish me to Lucifer and let my ass fry
I deserve to be burned for my ways
When concerned with the people I've affected
Life is way too short to stress it, I live it up

[Hook: Big KRIT]
Forever play the game
Forever swangin' thangs
Grippin' wood grain
Gotta do my thang
Ooh oh oh oh
(sample) Live it up, fill the cup, make a toast
Ooh oh oh oh
(sample) Live it up, fill the cup, make a toast
Ooh yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
I went from ashy to classy, candy-painted Caddies
With the woofers and the tweeters and the digits where the dash go
I deserve to be an asshole
'Cause when I was stranded, these motherfuckers passed go
Plottin' to pick my rhymes apart like I ain't the shit
Like I ain't a player (?)
You hard pressed to find any rapper hard as this
Lames is broads, and most of 'em bitch
Keep to myself cause most of 'em snitch
Claimin' they on, but none of 'em rich
None of 'em this, none of 'em KRIT
Statik, what's hapnin'
Bout time we got to it
Shit changed, today was boomin'
No doubt, I got through it
No doubt I got it covered, a country motherfucker
But ambitious to be king like those that came before him
I'm standin' on my own two nowadays
Enjoying things you get when you paid

[Hook: Big KRIT]
Forever play the game
Forever swangin' thangs
Grippin' wood grain
Gotta do my thang
Ooh oh oh oh
(sample) Live it up, fill the cup, make a toast
Ooh oh oh oh
(sample) Live it up, fill the cup, make a toast
Ooh yeah yeah yeah

Forever play the game
Forever swangin' thangs
Grippin' wood grain
Gotta do my thang

(sample) Live it up
