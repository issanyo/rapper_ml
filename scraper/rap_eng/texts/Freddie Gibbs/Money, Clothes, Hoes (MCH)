[Hook]
And I stay up on my toes
Money, clothes, hoes (x3)
They say anything goes
For money, clothes, hoes (x3)

[Verse 1]
I got diamonds on my wood, bitches on my phone
Serve these hoes like dope, they just canâ€™t leave this dick alone
You remind me of my jeep, got that for the broads
Took less than a week to hit that sweet and take it off
Bust it open for a pimp, make ya daddy proud
Boy y'all bet she blow, she blow this dick I blow this cloud
And we stay on purple drank, OG in my wood
Only smoke that Cali shit, I put that on my hood
I be thuggin' to the death of me, straight G.I. rider
Ain't no pussy in my pedigree
I mix the Molly with the Keisha that's my recipe
I just sit back and let this reefer get the best of me, the best of me
And I be thugging to the death of me, straight G.I. rider
Ain't no pussy in my pedigree
I mix the Molly with the Keisha that's my recipe
I just sit back and let this reefa get the best of me
And niggas know that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Got Versaces on my frame, Fendi on my waist
Girl you keep that clean, come sit that right here on my face
Said she got that super wet, we can super freak
Keep it on the low, don't put my business in the street
You remind me of my jeep, something like my sounds
Girl you know what's up, you turn it up, I beat it down
It's the realest niggas in it, you already know
Gangsta of the year, got that like 4 times in a row
I be thuggin to the death of me, straight G.I. rider
Ain't no pussy in my pedigree
I mix the Molly with the Keisha that's my recipe
I just sit back and let this reefer get the best of me
I get excited, I be pimpin' 'til the death of me
Straight G.I. rider, ain't no trickin' in my pedigree
I mix the Molly with the Kesha that's my recipe
I just sit back and let this reefer get the best of me
And niggas knows that
