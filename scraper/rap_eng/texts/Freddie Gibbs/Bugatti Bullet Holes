[Verse]
I was half-baked, a hundred percent up in this shit
Momma can't sleep she, thinking of losin' her son up in this shit
Whippin' the key, I swear it's a hundred guns up in this bitch
Keepin' the heat, the Gary police might run up in this bitch
Niggas where I'm from don't surrender, we shoot it out
We like them Tanner boys, give 'em life and they duke it out
You lookin' for that work I got beacoup under my couch
Aye y'all 15, 16 year old shooters up in my house
Labeled a menace, nigga
Bitch beaters, I send you pussies to the dentist, nigga
Orthodontist, the barber college
I give these niggas fades, straight tapers and chili bowls
He woke up in a brand new Bugatti with bullet holes
Fightin' for his life, heart rushin' and blood gushin'
Shake somethin', niggas corporate, but ain't thuggin'
Bitch, eight somethin', in the mornin', I'm up whippin'
Bitch I'm 'bout to break somethin', take somethin'
We set trippin' on these neutron ass niggas
Claim they ballin', but can't make a bond ass niggas
50 percent of fools I grew up with be out here snitchin'
So I keep my circle tight, you fuck with me I get you missin'
Y'll clippin' stitches for these neutron ass niggas
Give up your homie just to cut your time ass niggas
Fifty percent of fools I grew up with be out here snitchin'
So I keep a my circle tight, you fuck with me I get you missin'
Bitch, pay attention, Gangsta Gibbs
Vanderslice, nigga

[Outro]
We got a lot of what you like
And you're going to like us a lot
Awesome!
