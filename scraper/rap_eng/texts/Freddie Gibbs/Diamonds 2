[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, yea yeah
Yea yeah
Fuck it..
Kane

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Million dollar lick like can't nobody tell me shit, aye
Diamonds in my necklace, VVSs got me lit, aye
I just dropped a brick so big they got it off the lift, aye

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I can't lie, still love my baby mama
When she piss me off, I'm on some pimp shit, bumpin' LE$
Throw away that Tony, got me leanin, I can't fight the demons
I just, ri solo in my Beamer, tryna fight the demons, ay
Got that blow from my Dominicano
Got my whole garage on Forgiato
Wood and leather in my Eldorado
I just let them VVSs flood in my cubano

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Diamonds in my necklace, VVSs got me lit, aye
Million dollar lick, like can't nobody tell me shit, aye
I just dropped a brick so big, they got it off the lift, aye
Million dollar lick, like can't nobody tell me shit, aye

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I can't lie, still get high on prescriptions
Sometimes I go weeks without no sleep, I'm in the 5th dimension
I just caught a body, Luca Brasi, he sleep with the fishes
Fucked up part is when I go to sleep I see this nigga image
Bentley coupe, I guess you niggas out the loop, aye
Your hoe was a layup, threw myself an alley-oop, aye
Served that Tony Toni, when a nigga had no loot, aye
Your hoe was a layup, threw myself a alley-oop, aye
Got that blow from my Dominicano
Got my whole garage on Forgiato
Wood and leather in my El Dorado
I just let 'em VVSs flood in my cubano

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Diamonds in my necklace, VVSs got me lit, aye
Million dollar lick, like can't nobody tell me shit, aye
I just dropped a brick so big, they got it off the lift, aye
Million dollar lick, like can't nobody tell me shit, aye

[Verse: Cassie Jo Craig]
Let me show you, let me take you there
Everything you ever wanted yeah
Let me show you, let me take you there
Everything you ever wanted yeah
Let me show you, everything you
Let me show you, everything you
Let me show you, let me take you there
Everything you ever wanted yeah
Let me show you, let me take you there
Everything you ever wanted yeah

[Outro: Irie Jane Gibbs]
