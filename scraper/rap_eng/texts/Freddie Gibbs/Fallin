[Verse One] [Freddie Gibbs]:
Gibbs
Bitch I do this to the dizzert
Murder stay on my mind and my fitted stay to the lizzeft
Try to stay up out the street, out the pen, out the casket
Keep a pocket full of plastic, I posted up with this package
I roll a blunt with the hash and get blasted up off some NASA shit
Authorities say I'm below average because I'm African
There's more to me than baggin' up boulders, buckin' and blastin' shit
I carry my whole town on my shoulders
Niggas be askin' if Freddie the return of the real
These niggas fairytale
Seven day same clothes, I'm gon' make every sale
That 2,300 dollars left in a digi scale
I'm 'bout to cop me two w when I split 'em
Whippin' and flippin' yayo
Seems like I'm disgracin' my race on this paper chase
Peep the mirror everyday, look the devil straight in the face
I done threw some niggas off, I threw .38's in the lake
How much can I really take for another taste of this cake?

[Verse Two] [Termanology]:
Termanology
I be reppin' for Murder Mizzle
Tryin' to stay on my grizzle
My people is all official
Crystals all on the hizzle
Packin' my semi pistol, equipped with the mini missiles
That drizzle and make a whistle
Listen, my life is crazy
Been through some extra shady
Shit in my life that made me the man I am so you hear me
If you wanna run my corner
Taught me never to be cocky, watch for paparazzi
In the copper car to watch me be sloppy
With the walkie talkie, hopin' they can stop and lock me
Turn a dime piece, gettin' posse into a squad of zombies
But I be calamari eatin' with a bunch of 'Ricans
On South Beach where the breeze is smooth like the Mona Lisa
Cop an' O of reefer
Write a bunch of Ether
They want a feature I'm burnin' a hole up in they speaker
Some call me a teacher
Cause I'm a solid man
So take my hand and follow me to the promise land
