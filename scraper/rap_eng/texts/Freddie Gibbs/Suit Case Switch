[Sample]
"I have lived my life...I have dreamed my dreams
Now death, take me away"

[Verse One: Verbal Kent]
Ayo my raps are like the facts of life
We are less alike
You're raps are dike, just like the cast of Facts of Life
Let me cast a light
Shed it even
I don't give a fuck about getting even
Cause if I did I'd be in the crib in a Posture'
Monster, underneath the bed you're sleeping
Drink 'til I'm real real wildly
Grab a pen can't stop me
Fuck around re-write Kill Bill
Have it with Uma Thurman and Bill Cosby
Have a puddy puddy pop in his asshole
Make him pop pills, wake up buck naked
Ass up, pants tied with his mouth all [?] faced
Found in the ground in a sandcastle
I'm a motherfucking master, ask the body
No asterisk, I'll body bag somebody
So acrobatic, I'll bet you're acrobotic, Inspector Gadget
Go-Go Robo Bo Jackson body
Never been a better metaphor four slinger
Show me a beat I ain't a four four king of
And I'll fork over a four course dinner
I'm gonna put four little holes in a foe denim
You keep closing the suitcase bitch
I keep doe in a suitcase bitch
Two identicals, do a suitcase switch
Pay me your Adrian Peterson switch
Maybe get rich
Eat at Gibson's on a Tuesday lunch
Got a hunch Tuesday you'll be at the Liquor Boy Towne Center every Tuesday brunch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Now I lay me down to sleep
Bad bitch laying right next to me
Sexing me, wake up, beat that pussy with my diamond teeth
These niggas be downing me
These hoes should be crowning me
Crowning me, G.I. nigga
Church/crack house niggas both down the streets
Which one you gon' run to? How much bread can he run through?
Digging in the muhfucking pack, man you can't make back what the dope man front you
[?] homicide is what it come to
Black masks when we come through
12 gauge hit him in his ribs cause a motherfucker did what a nigga can't undo
Bloody murder, murder
Nah, nah can't take that back
Fuck the Feds I won't tell 'em shit, go to my grave with that
Homeboy wanna go half on a brick, yeah yeah I stay with that
Had some snitches slip through the clique
Might bring my pager back
I don't know why these niggas be downing me
These hoes should be crowning me
Cop a pound, half a pound, quarter pound, an ounce from me
Bought a bitch a pair of J's, she's bagging dope and count for me
New Jack City with the titties out
Turn around and see what this dick about
Gibbs
