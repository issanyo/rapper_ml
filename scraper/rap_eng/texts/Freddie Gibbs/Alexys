[Intro]
Kane, nigga, on the blade
I think, I think niggas forgot who, you know, who gave, who gave these niggas this flow, you know what I'm sayin'?
Baby Scarface

[Verse 1]
I first taste cocaine in 10th grade
Homie at the table choppin' Rick James
Sent the package off from Texas, it's been six days
Keep sweatin' like a pig until that bitch came
Nigga had to keep a job, livin' off in my momma's spot
Fuck it, I'ma bust a fuckin' jugg, I'm a juggernaut
Pop a zone and drop it off in that water we was cookin' out
Loud packs and molly powder all these niggas pushin' out
Feds lookin' because I peddled paint to these poor folks
The realest niggas that I know ain't never sold dope
The hardest niggas that I know ain't never served time
Soon as I got me thirty thousand, I hit the bird line
And I brought that dog back to the set, nigga, you know me for that
Shout out to my niggas from D.C. with them scorpion packs
Keep this strictly business, you can't mix up your homie with that
One day you might have to clap a nigga, no glory in that
Feel like I'm outgrowin' all my friends, niggas thinkin' small
Gon' have to write them all a check, just to get the shit resolved
Turn right back around and write them another one when they trick it off
Get successful and watch how quickly niggas get in their feelings, dog
Get successful and watch how you immediately become their competition
Niggas worse than a side bitch, they can't quite stay in a position
Don't know what niggas crave more, money or a-fuckin-ttention
And these the niggas I'm cool with, my enemies I have yet to mention

[Chorus]
I got cake, bitch, everyday be my birthday
You can't take me off first place on my worst day
Streets dry niggas thirsty, so I pray that when they come and take me
That this mini Draco make the earth shake
Have a nigga on some underneath-the-earth shit
My nigga Shermie caught a murder on his first lick
These animalistic instincts that we was born with
Felt so pimpish when Alexys put me in the foreign whip
Black as hell but rap got me thinkin' I need a foreign bitch
Takin' my black queens for granted, got me ignorin' them

[Verse 2]
Names I be callin' her, nigga, I know you be doggin' her
What kind of man is you to you little niece and yo' daughter and 'em?
Iâ€™m posted at the stove with that yola, that soda lockin' in
Ving Rhames guns and butter niggas get margarine
Pussy niggas can't play they part, we dearly departed them
Quick like OJ Simpson, you Bart, Homer, and Marge and 'em
I rap but I keep weight and I know the streets take
Niggas out the game, my baby momma told me be safe
Turned around and said, "Fuck safe, I stay dangerous"
In the set with Sodi, no chopper, my chain danglin'
In the set with deuce, I be blood and we gang gangin' 'em
My nigga Corleone and Diego, they smash craniums
Livin' life on high speed, nigga, that's just the lane we in
About to cop a Porsche from that the packet that Freddie Kane gettin'

[Chorus]
I got cake, bitch, everyday be my birthday
You can't take me off first place on my worst day
Streets dry niggas thirsty, so I pray that when they come and take me
That this mini Draco make the earth shake
Have a nigga on some underneath-the-earth shit
My nigga Shermie caught a murder on his first lick
These animalistic instincts that we was born with
Felt so pimpish when Alexys put me in the foreign whip
Black as hell but rap got me thinkin' I need a foreign bitch
Takin' my black queens for granted, got me ignorin' them
