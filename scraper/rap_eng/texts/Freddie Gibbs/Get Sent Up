I've been working on another fresh rhyme
Just another way to spend my time
When I'm on the mic I speak my mind
Show you niggas all about my grind
How I gotta count them stacks
Get out on the street and push them packs
I ain't always been a rapper homie
I just started doin this a couple years back
I wrote my first rap
FingerRoll recorded my first track
When he heard the way I spit it
He was so amazed
FingerRoll invited me back
To the studio to do a song
When I hit the booth again I never zone
This another way to get them bucks
Everybody about to get sent up

A lot of rappers hate
Probably cuz they can't make these hits like us
Listen to the shit I bust
You about to get sent up
Blow a lil dank
Pour a lil drank
Let the liquor fill my cup
Let a nigga twist that blunt
I'mma about to get sent up

Yall niggas hate me cuz I came up in the game so quick
You be wishing you could flow like this
Maybe you pull a ho like this
Have her blowin dro like this
Backstage at a show like this
I'mma blow a lil skunk get the bitch drunk
Have the hooker blow my dick
Baby im a pimp to the end
We can hit the tele you can bring a friend
I'mma bring the weed and a 5th of gin
Room 210 red roof inn
Bitch get up in this truck
Let a muthafucka tap that butt
I'mma bout to run up in this slut
Baby you about to get sent up

A lot of rappers hate
Probably cuz they can't make these hits like us
Listen to the shit I bust
You about to get sent up
Blow a lil dank
Pour a lil drank
Let the liquor fill my cup
Let a nigga twist that blunt
I'mma about to get sent up

When it come to spittin that heat
Freddie is a muthafuckin pro
I can spit a flow fast or slow
Niggas know that im about to blow
Labels gotta drop that dough
I shine like my fing glow
If a nigga wanna try to play me like a ho
Ima let the choppa blow
Ima play it cool
Keep a level head I ain't gonna start no shit
Ima keep making them hits
When I drop niggas about to be sick
In the booth I can't be touched
Im about to get this dust
Listen to this shit I bust
You about to get sent up

A lot of rappers hate
Probably cuz they can't make these hits like us
Listen to the shit I bust
You about to get sent up
Blow a lil dank
Pour a lil drank
Let the liquor fill my cup
Let a nigga twist that blunt
I'mma about to get sent up

A lot of rappers hate
Probably cuz they can't make these hits like us
Listen to the shit I bust
You about to get sent up
Blow a lil dank
Pour a lil drank
Let the liquor fill my cup
Let a nigga twist that blunt
I'mma about to get sent up
