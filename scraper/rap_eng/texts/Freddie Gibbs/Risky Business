[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, yeah (I been, I been)
I been, I been overworked and underpaid
Underground nigga, forced to pay this price of fame
Got me writing with my lights out, I seen brighter days
In my jail cell, tears dripping on the page
Phony charge got me facing double digits overseas
I can't see my daughter and I'm, knee deep in lawyer fees
Bond set at six figures, real nigga bailing out
Homies owe me paper on the streets, them niggas played me out
Came home on my feet, boy I don't need no bitch to take me in
Choppers in my secret safe, my bitch ain't got the safety pin
Dak Prescott in a nigga's spot, bitch, I play to win
Ice water, fork, Richard Pryor rock on my plate again
I should have a deal with Gillette the way I be shaving now
Scripts for the Percs in my neighbor's name
Serve my neighbor that
8th grade teacher took my beeper never gave it back
Dope boy, Motorola Timeport, StarTAC
Purple wire tap on like 9 9's on the Nextel
Moving flagrant, Alphabet agents they got me catching hell
Bring ya paper, weigh the work, nigga gotta pay the work
Short sinners, major work, nigga check his paperwork
My daddy got addiction for bitches, but did he pass it to me?
Wonder if these Backwoods or syrup putting that cancer in me
Wonder should I get the silver Bentley or the silver Benz
Wonder if my homie plotting on me, nigga, fuck a friend, bitch

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
A bitch nigga
Ain't got shit but a bullet for a, a bitch nigga
I took a lot of risk to be a, a rich nigga
Ain't got shit but a bullet for a, a bitch nigga, bitch nigga
A bitch, a bitch nigga
Ain't got shit but a bullet for a, a bitch nigga
I took a lot of risk to be a, a rich nigga
Ain't got shit but a bullet for a, a bitch nigga, a bitch nigga

[Verse 2: Ransom]
Whoever knew this the price to win?
I write the sins of a felon, struggling to fight the pen
It might depend on you turning these little mice to men
Despite your friends and haters who praying
Wait for your life to end (damn!)
It might offend 'cause I'm probably addressing you
Momma told me hit the targets and kill the messenger too (blaow!)
You can tell them naked lies, but these niggas address the truth
We gon' see you keep it straight when them niggas is pressing you
Bitch nigga, we can't relate to your lifestyle (lifestyle)
We rich niggas, don't gotta wait 'til that price down (price down)
You snitch niggas swim by that lake and you might drown
Right now, begging, screaming
And praying for Christ now, pipe down (shhhh)
Don't gotta make a sound when your soul leaving out
'Cause a comfortable death is what foes dream about
It ain't nothing left when them holes bleeding out (nah)
You can take ya last breath, go 'head and breathe it out
You don't see my vision, I paint the pictures I'm living
Ex-felon, thumbing through several letters written in prison
To my mother, I tell her 'bout my struggles with different women She tell me that they come dime a dozen
Try not to love 'em, but respect 'em (let's go)
Damn, did my father teach you these lessons?
Either I'm a splitting image or I am truly a blessing?
You guys are new to aggression, frail as a stick figure
Rich niggas, and we got no remorse for you bitch niggas
Bitch nigga

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
A bitch nigga
Ain't got shit but a bullet for a, a bitch nigga
I took a lot of risk to be a, a rich nigga
Ain't got shit but a bullet for a, a bitch nigga, bitch nigga
A bitch, a bitch nigga
Ain't got shit but a bullet for a, a bitch nigga
I took a lot of risk to be a, a rich nigga
Ain't got shit but a bullet for a, a bitch nigga, a bitch nigga
