[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Skin tight pants muff print no underwear
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
She give me head in a Carrera and cruise
She addicted to the D-boyz talking that street slang
That keep the dick up in her 2 feet in the D game
Standing on the bus stop mama hold my bag of rocks
Jumped up out that hooptie this summer baby we in the drop
Spend it and flaunt it take your pick however you want it
Don't mind bitches my side bitches knocked off opponents
They simply leasing this penis but baby I'm the owner
My Compton bitch hear polices rate me in California
So I done cut a lot of hoes off
I activate this actavis so I can dose off
And I don't argue with no bitch I set that straight from the gate
Bet all my mack and money makers relate
I'm just a player baby

[Hook]
That's why it's money over bitches
I steps in with the mo where the hoes at baby?
That's why it's money over bitches
I steps in with the mo where the hoes at?
It's always money over bitches
I steps in with the mo where the hoes at baby?
That's why it's money over bitches
I steps in with the mo where the hoes at?

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
This might be hard as it get
I bought an ounce on the first like it was part of my rent
I'm in Paris drinking mo thank God for this shit
Cause I'm from south central baby pardon my french
Yea I know ball players, James Harden and shit

Oh you getting head now look I taught her this shit
This nigga treat her like she your daughter and shit
Type of nigga golfing with her father and shit
Found out I was fucking, he was bothered a bit
I'm a cool nigga it's not a problem to switch
Look you in yo face what type of problem is this
Caught him on the chin then he stumbled a bit
The right then left niggas rumbled and shit
