[Verse 1]
As these drugs alter my heartbeat
Ain't been taking my medication, don't get me started, G
Hustling, jacking, murder, and macking been such a part of me
Such an evil seed, wonder what will my son or daughter be?
Killers
I'm too crazy, ain't fit to raise 'em
Streets might send yo daddy off on vacation or early grave him
Asked my pastor, is there some special place in heaven for gangsters?
In the eighth grade I was selling eight-balls off that pager, put it on my nation
I'm done living out my shoebox
Crack rock cooking on two pots
Came up in the school of the ski mask
Where you quick to make a punk bitch move out
I'm raised way deep on the east side
Right next to the Dorie Miller projects
GDs, Vice Lords on the same set
Wear ya hat the wrong way, you get popped at
And I got a hundred round drum on the AK
Killed a nigga and his homeboy the same day
Now I'm looking for the third motherfucker cause I burn motherfuckers in the rap game same way
And the label never gave no fucks
Tell 'em only thing that dropped was these nuts
Thinking that I'm playing with niggas cuz I don't cater to niggas
I just be taking from niggas and I be waiting for niggas to get

[Hook]
Let's get it started
Ho, we don't need no water, burn 'em
Let's get it started
Ho, we don't need no water, burn 'em
Let's get it started
Ho, we don't need no water
Cause I woke up, lit my smoke up, cooked my dope up, and said fuck the world
Woke up, lit my smoke up, and said fuck the world
Woke up, cooked my dope up, and said fuck the world
Woke up, lit my smoke up, and said fuck the world
Woke up, cooked my dope up, and said fuck the world

[Verse 2]
If you gangsta and you know it nigga, stack ya' bands
Whether you knee-deep in them kilos or you sacking grams
This life we live, man, it's so cutthroat make you clap your friends
No ambulance, they just took their bodies in matching vans
Please call the coroner, left some trash on my corner, bruh
I was on tour for the summer, every bitch I fucked was a foreigner
And your bitch was a bust it, met the whole click, fucked, and recorded her
Got some top at the Marriot, dropped her off in the morning
Girl, my morning cup of coffee is a double cup of syrup
Don't take orders from no nigga, fuck your boss and fuck the world
And I'm good in every hood, don't need no passes or referral
Me and crack go way back like starter caps and jheri curls
Whip it girl

[Bridge x2]
From a G to a kilo
To a mill from a motherfucking zero
4-5 when I look through the peephole
Nigga, I'm the real G Money, no Nino

[Hook]
