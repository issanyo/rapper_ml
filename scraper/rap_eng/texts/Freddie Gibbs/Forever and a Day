[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Bitch (I'mma make it even if it take forever and a day now)

Yeah
I done did a lot of...
Yeah (I'mma make it even if it take forever and a day now)

[Bridge]
I done did a lot of bad things just to get change
I done took it to some levels that a lot of niggas won't go
Yeah
(I'mma make it even if it take forever and a day, now)
I done did a lot of bad things just to get change
I done took it to some levels that a lot of niggas won't go
Yeah
(I'mma make it even if it take forever and a day, now)

[Verse 1]
I done did a lot of bad things just to get change
I done took it to some levels that a lot of niggas won't go
Take a life just to get a name
Came up with the crackheads, thugs and the cut-throats
Bloodshot from the blunt smoke
Man I'm so high that I can't even look my own momma in the eyes
Kicked out through the front door
She said the way a nigga livin', if I die, she won't be surprised
Tears on the Bible, she prayed for me
This can't be the life that she made for me
Got her lying to police when they raid for me
If there's a heaven will they open up the gates for me?
I wanted money for the summer, make a nigga trunk knock
Gang signs out the window screamin' out fuck cops
Soft dope, hard dope, get it all one stop
Slung crack rock, never had a wicked jump shot, yeah
Middle school, it was no joke
Hats broke to the right in the hall it was all folks
Little Lord had to lay low
Had a .38, I kept it in my locker, you ain't even know
I wasn't from their hood so the Westside niggas ain't really have no reason to respect a nigga
And since I went to school with them motherfuckers
Niggas from my hood actin' like they ain't accept a nigga
All that I could do was lash out
Get a couple down niggas, put the mask on, cash out
Broad day with the strap out
Can't forget it, don't regret it, gave a nigga somethin' to rap about
All that I could do was lash out
Get a couple down niggas, put the mask on, cash out
Broad day with the strap out
Last real nigga standing, I'm the one you niggas rap about
Yeah

[Hook]
Fuck what niggas say now
I'mma make it even if it take forever and a day now
No games, can't play now
If I see you at the top, will I see you on the way down?
Fuck what a nigga say now
I'mma make it even if it take forever and a day now
No games, can't play now
If I see you at the top, will I see you on the way down? (Yeah)
Will I see you on the way down? (Yeah)
Will I see you on the way down? (Yeah)
I'mma see you on the way down (Yeah)
Bet I feel it from the waist down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, keep your head up nigga
Yeah, I know you fed up nigga
Yeah, so get your bread up nigga
Where the club, we can tear it up nigga, yeah
Pop a bottle of that Ace, take it to the dome
Free my nigga Will Scrilla, bring that nigga home
Yeah, I did it for the hood, now a nigga known
Fuck rap, dope game put a nigga on
Dope game, rap game, got a nigga stressed
Heavy smokin', heavy drinkin', running through a check
Got me trippin', diamonds drippin' off a nigga neck
Runnin' through a hundred bitches, who I'm doin next?
And my girl at the crib, got her own
She don't need a dog nigga like that
It be a hole in my motherfuckin' soul if see another nigga wife that
Don't like that, but it's like that
Steady tryin to keep my cool in a game full of fake niggas
Backstabbin' and snake niggas
Do a song with you, talk about you, smile in your face niggas
Shouts out to the nigga Snow
We was tryin' to take the world just like Tony and Manolo
But he shot me at the front door
He ain't want to see another nigga happy that's a no-no
All that I could do was lash out
Get a couple down niggas, put the mask on, cash out
Broad day with the strap out
Can't forget it, don't regret it, gave a nigga somethin' to rap about
All that I could do was lash out
Get a couple down niggas, put the mask on, cash out
Broad day with the strap out
Last real nigga standing, I'm the one you niggas rap about
Yeah

[Hook]
Fuck what niggas say now
I'mma make it even if it take forever and a day now
No games, can't play now
If I see you at the top, will I see you on the way down?
Fuck what a nigga say now
I'mma make it even if it take forever and a day now
No games, can't play now
If I see you at the top, will I see you on the way down? (Yeah)
Will I see you on the way down? (Yeah)
Will I see you on the way down? (Yeah)
I'mma see you on the way down (Yeah)
Bet I feel it from the waist down
