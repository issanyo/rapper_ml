(Ozzy Osbourne)
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
You gotta close your eyes for me

(Freddie Gibbs)
Yeah
Keep 'em closed
Haha, yeah

(Verse 1)
Imagine this, livin' in a spot without a pot piss
Or no windows to open up so you can pour out the shit
Livin' dead cause you ain't really livin' without a grip
Hella shit to pay, baby on the way ain't that bout a bitch
It's 1982, she gave birth to you and dropped outta college
Raised you in the Atlas but full of addicts and alcoholics
No place to live, yo momma and her momma crib
No paper for labor, her pockets broke before her water did
Not just a ghetto kid, she was a survivor
Mum a hard working women but daddy's a womanizer
Saw him cheat her and beat her then leave her like he despised her
So when you grew up to be that way it didn't suprise her
The thug in your blood, she love you but can't control you
Conditions that you livin' are starting to shape and mold you
She say the devil in your head
He introduce you to the streets, yo my name is Fred
I'm in it til my coffin close

(Hook)
(Close your eyes)
Can you imagine that?
(Close your eyes)
Sit back and blaze a sack
(You gotta close your eyes for me)
Now I lay me down to sleep
Always lay down with my heat
Gotta jump back on my feet
I'm in the street, until my coffin close

(Close your eyes)
Can you imagine that?
(Close your eyes)
Nigga, sit back and blaze a sack
(You gotta close your eyes for me)
Now I lay me down to sleep
Always lay down with my heat
Gotta jump back on my feet
I'm in the street, until my coffin close

(Verse 2)
Yeah
Streets cold, these youngin' niggas is gettin' bold
Murder on the daily this funeral shit is gettin' old
Ya soul searchin' for another way to make it through
College, military, that 9 to 5 shit don't work for you
So what you do? Load another clip, we plot another lick
You got a thing for music and your homies like the way you spit
The lords showin' you a sign you can't ignore the shit
Put your pain on paper, hit the lab and go record the shit
Your fan base is gettin' big
This Jewish kid from California working your label now you got this cracker on your dick
Told his boss the Judas shit and everybody feelin' him
He took advantage of your thirst and signed you for the minimum
The rap stopped sellin' and he started acting funny
Your manager just managed a way to jerk you for your money
But them crackers said they had your back
You got a record deal so why you back to sellin' crack?
They wanna see your coffin close

(Hook)
(Close your eyes)
Can you imagine that?
(Close your eyes)
Sit back and blaze a sack
(You gotta close your eyes for me)
Now I lay me down to sleep
Always lay down with my heat
Gotta jump back on my feet
I'm in the street, until my coffin close

(Close your eyes)
Can you imagine that?
(Close your eyes)
Nigga, sit back and blaze a sack
(You gotta close your eyes for me)
Now I lay me down to sleep
Always lay down with my heat
Gotta jump back on my feet
I'm in the street, until my coffin close

(Verse 3)
Yeah
You right back where you started, careless and broken hearted
One shot away from being part of the dearly departed
These haters bustin' choppers at you so you bustin' back
That rapping dream you had that's out the window, you like fuck that
Your girl says she pregnant
Your grandma just passed away
Your homie took one in the head
Your cousin just got murked today
Psychologically this shit done sent you on a rampage
Niggas look at you wrong and you bustin' off that 12 gauge
All you do is hell raise
Let that bottle solve your problems
Liquor with the pills, codeine, Xanax, and OxyContin
Drug habit off the hook
Step away from snorting powder
Paranoia waking you up out your sleep like every hour
This is not a movie cause every day niggas get devoured
By the street, losing they life, they enticed by money and power
Until the game bring a nigga to the end
I just pray the lord forgive me for my sins

(Hook)
(Close your eyes)
Can you imagine that?
(Close your eyes)
Sit back and blaze a sack
(You gotta close your eyes for me)
Now I lay me down to sleep
Always lay down with my heat
Gotta jump back on my feet
I'm in the street, until my coffin close

(Close your eyes)
Can you imagine that?
(Close your eyes)
Nigga, sit back and blaze a sack
(You gotta close your eyes for me)
Now I lay me down to sleep
Always lay down with my heat
Gotta jump back on my feet
I'm in the street, until my coffin close
