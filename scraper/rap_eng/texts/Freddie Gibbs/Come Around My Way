[Hook]
You think you know but you ain't got no clue
What the street life will make you do
Follow me lemme show you how we grind, how we stack our pay
Fuck tomorrow cause we livin' for today
Come around my way
You think you know but you ain't got no clue
What the street life will make you do
Follow me lemme show you how we grind, how we stack our pay
Fuck tomorrow cause we livin' for today
Come around my way

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of dealin' with this constant stress
The only thing guaranteed to a nigga is death
So we run the risk of gettin' arrested
But its hard gettin' money in my hood cause the block congested
Niggas get heated and pull out them vests
If you scared to get tested
Homie this is something you shouldn't mess with
I saw some fatal images when I was eleven
Thats when my uncle got addicted to the shit he was sellin'
And I just took it as a lesson and learned from his mistakes
I'mma keep my faith in god til I catch my break
They say my momma's first born turned out to be a thug nigga
A bad example for my brother and my little sister
I could do better and I knew that shit
I had a couple opportunities I blew that shit
But being lord of the streets will make you do that shit
You get a job go to school and shit
I'd rather move that brick

[Hook]
You think you know but you ain't got no clue
What the street life will make you do
Follow me lemme show you how we grind, how we stack our pay
Fuck Tomorrow cause we livin' for today
Come around my way
You think you know but you ain't got no clue
What the street life will make you do
Follow me lemme show you how we grind, how we stack our pay
Fuck tomorrow cause we livin' for today
Come around my way

[Bridge]
Come and take a lil' trip to my hood (Come around my way)
And see that everything ain't all good (Come around my way)
If I could turn my life around I would (Come around my way)
Fuck tomorrow cause we livin' for today (Come around my way)

[Verse 2]
All the businesses by the arabs and asians
In the city its 90 percent black
The mayor is caucasian
I ain't prejudice I just tell it how it is
This is one of the worst places you can raise yo kids
Cause instead of buildin' schools they buildin' more prisons
Our tax dollars is feeding all these greedy politicians
They sittin'; up gettin'; fat while we starve in the hood
The unemployment rate is bonkers ain't no jobs in the hood
If you ain't working a job then you movin' some work
Stickin'; these needles, pimpin'; these bitches, or doin' some dirt
It's amazing what motherfuckers will do for the murk
You get too comfortable your whole fuckin' crew will get murked
You got your ticket out the hood I suggest you get up on it
We prayin' for the future but we livin'; for the moment
Whatever's necessary I'mma do it til they drop my body in the cemetery
