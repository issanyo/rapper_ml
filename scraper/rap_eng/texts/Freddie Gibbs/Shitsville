[Verse 1]
Niggas ain't gon' shit then get the fuck up off the toilet stool
Bent behind my tinteds, I commence to take these boys to school
Don't drive no yellow bus but I got mayonnaise and mustard
Both tires gold wired on my Chevrolet bucket
And now my transmission leaking and my rear suspension squeaking
Drop a rock off to my geeker, fix my shit man, I'm out here creeping
Twist that shit but I'm out here tweaking for that 20 twin twin
Kick that shit in '95 or watching "Friday" with my friends
Fucked your bitch in '96, hit that pussy for 6 minutes
Said the dick was everything she envisioned on each visit
Papa kept his condoms in his bottom drawer, they for his bottom ho
I stole that shit when I was out, I wonder if my mama know
I wonder if she found the dimes and nickels in my Nike box
I wonder if she know her older brother like to light them rocks
I wonder if she able to get by if I get killed
Told her I was just knee deep in the shit
Welcome to Shitsville, nigga

[Hook]
You wake up everyday and pray before you sleep, right?
You motherfuckers just like me
You shed tears when you're hurting; if I cut you then you bleed, right?
You motherfuckers just like me
But bitch you're acting like your shit don't stink (shit's real)
Bitch you're acting like your shit don't stink (Shitsville)
I said you you acting like your shit don't stink (shit's real)
Bitch you acting like your shit don't stink (welcome to Shitsville, nigga)

[Verse 2]
Niggas ain't gon' shit then get the fuck up off the pizz-ot
Got O's of loud in my living room like I was Lennox
Trapped a nigga and his wife for his wallet and his wristwatch
And they say I might do life in jail for kidnap, bitch
I did not give a single solitary fuck
I stand on all ten toes, one dick and two nuts, don't do yayo or shoot up
But I went back and forth with some work and went through a few plugs
This white devil society dare a nigga to do drugs
And dare yo ass to deal 'em, distribute and conceal 'em
My niggas don't got no boats or no ports, how you think we get 'em?
Crack was black America's cup of coffee in the beginnin'
When they creep up and you waking, you crackers can fight the feelin'
Motherfuck euthanasia, I'll lace your food up with razors
Make you gargle with saltwater, excuse yourself from my table
I fathered these fuck niggas with fables, pussy, I been real
Good on any street up shit's creek in Shitsville, nigga

[Hook]
You wake up everyday and pray before you sleep, right?
You motherfuckers just like me
You shed tears when you're hurting; if I cut you then you bleed, right?
You motherfuckers just like me
But bitch you're acting like your shit don't stink (shit's real)
Bitch you're acting like your shit don't stink (Shitsville)
I said you you acting like your shit don't stink (shit's real)
Bitch you acting like your shit don't stink (welcome to Shitsville, nigga)

[Bridge]
Cheat on your girl, your wife, sneak out and fuck hoes
You motherfuckers just like me
Drink all the liquor, blow weed, probably play with your nose
You motherfuckers just like me
I said you motherfuckers just like me
I said you motherfuckers just like me
I know you motherfuckers just like me
You ain't no better, hell, you're just like me

[Outro]
I said hold on bitch, you travelling too fast
I'm supposed to be dragging my foot out your motherfucking ass
Said bitch I'm known from the Golden Gates of Frisco to the Eagle Pass
I'm know to play big time landlords
Kick chicken shit hoes right in their motherfucking ass
And if my luck continues to hold out in the future
Like it has in the past, I'ma continue to kick you chicken shit hoes
Right in your motherfucking ass
Said bitch this is the worlds of wonder
Long dick book bender, all night grinder
Wound finder, sheet shaker, baby maker and money taker
