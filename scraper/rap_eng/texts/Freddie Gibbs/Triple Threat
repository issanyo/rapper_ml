[Intro]
'Til we get it right baby, yah
Mix it up 'til we get it right, yah
If anything stay in your lane, you in my city now
Put diamonds on me and my riders on me
Came like Lebron, only trill niggas doing this shit
Ridin' on 'em never dyin' on em
Man you can't tell me a motherfuckin' thing, bruh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Triple-threat, triple-black the 'Vetteâ€”left it drippin' wet
Drippin' wet, whip that chicken wet, I just trippled that
Trip with that, bitch I'm whipping wet, put that on the set
On the set, I iced up the set, put that on my neck
On my neck, stay in your lane, this game'll lay you down
Bentley thang, last night Mulsanne, today Mercedes down
Pinky rang, iced out my chain, these hoes can't play me now
Bentley thang, last night Mulsanne, today Mercedes now

[Chorus]
Fuck your convo bitch, I'm here for the sex, I must confess
Hit your ho and left that shit drippin' wet, I must confess
Fuck this rap shit, I'm just here for the check, I must confess
Po-po throw the hundred years on the desk, I won't confess
Bro my dope it smoke like ain't no tomorrow, yo that's my motto
Fuck your homies make you po' out the bottle, bitch I'm a rider
Bro my dope it smoke like ain't no tomorrow, yo that's my motto
Fuck your homies make you po' out the bottle, bitch I'm a rider

[Verse 2]
Triple-threat, checked them with the TEC, left 'em drippin' wet
Triple-threat, she a triple-threat; booty, pussy, neck
Pussy, neck, papers, pussy wet, guess who pushin' that?
Pushin' that, I crossed out the set, left 'em drippin' wet
Drippin' wet, stay in your lane, this game will lay you down
Bentley thang, no wedding rang, ten different ladies now
What you claim? I bang the same, we straight gang gangin' now
Package cain, hard white cocaine, I'm whippin' babies now

[Chorus]
Fuck your convo bitch, I'm here for the sex, I must confess
Hit your hope and left that shit drippin' wet, I must confess
Fuck this rap shit, I'm just here for the check, I must confess
Po-po throw the hundred years on the desk, I won't confess
Bro my dope it smoke like ain't no tomorrow, yo that's my motto
Fuck your homies make you po' out the bottle, bitch I'm a rider
Bro my dope it smoke like ain't no tomorrow, yo that's my motto
Fuck your homies make you po' out the bottle, bitch I'm a rider

[Outro]
My diamonds on me and my riders on me, yeah
Ridin' on 'em, never dyin' on em, yeah
My diamonds on me and my riders on me, yeah
Ridin' on 'em, never dyin' on em, yeah
What?
