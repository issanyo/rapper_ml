Saddle up the ting dem like donkey, make we go fi dem

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Here comes the boom! *Boom!* Bounce
Million dollar house
Money that we count
Flipped a couple ounces
Yayo like a mountain
Hit 'em, have 'em spitting up blood like a fountain
Down to get cash up, mass up, the ritual
Take you off this Earth you
Papa said, ""
Cell, no telling
They probably wanna see me dead and broke, man
No rest in peace my enemy, I smoked one
Don't gamble with your life, boy, you're not smart
Gangsta, don't cross one
Bad man

[Chorus: Popcaan]
Yeah, yeah we -
Bad, born bad, ba-bad
Ba-bad, born bad
Mmm
Ba-bad, born bad, ba-bad
Why dem a gwan bad?
We bad, born bad, ba-bad
Ba-bad, born bad
Mmm
Bad, born bad, ba-bad
Why dem a gwan bad?

[Verse 4: Popcaan]
Yeah
A couldn't me dem a romp with
And dem know say me mad and me haunted
No care if me waan run wanted
But, from me a damn kid the 17 a mi favorite Glock
Bwoy drop pon the ground when me waving that
Anuh glue when your armor pierce with shot
Can't win no war with chat
Bwoy
Any robbery me go pon so, me lay down flat
Haffi go to Meadowrest, somewhere near Dovecot
Me no hang out a bar, that a bait up spot
Dem only full up of beare tough chat

[Chorus: Popcaan]
Unruly!

Ba-bad, born bad

Ba-bad, born bad, ba-bad
