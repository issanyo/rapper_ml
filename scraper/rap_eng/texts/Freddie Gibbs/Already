[Intro]
And you're gonna find there's nothing in the world I wouldn't do for you...just ask baby
And you know I'll come through baby

[Verse 1: Trae]
I'm from the bottom of the gutter, makin it ain't an option
Fightin to make it out, like all a nigga know is boxin
And even if a nigga win, I told him I'd be back again
Chopper in the front seat, next to these cocaine blocks again
I'll never let it go, bitch I'm the king of the streets
Caught up in ghetto dreams, like I'm in permanent sleep
Swangers of the beat, this like old school fresh outta class
Plus my driver kinda high
He fired, he fuck up'd his glass
Don't mind my temper, I'm a asshole they ain't told ya?
I'll beat the brakes up off ya like it's nothin, they ain't showed ya?
Bitch I'm the hood, you can tell by these corners I sell
If I was raided you can tell em I'm done with exhale
Under this blow I'm trying to get em to work on this scale
My brother caught a case, I'm still trying to work on his bail
I know it's real, but you can tell him I'll never leave
And everything I grip will stay the same if I ever leave

[Hook]
You already know they
It's the dope super bowl and nigga I'm out to win it

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I done not wanted, not welcomed, in my own home
Don't talk to my girl, so deadly I blow a whole zone
Seem like everyday I rob, steal, cheat
Said one day I might get sent up by some brawls in the street
Cause what goes around comes around, and I've been dishin plenty out
Always kept it cruising through my city with my semis out
Never let you jack me, rather let a jury hear me out
Give me life, my niggas hit the court house and clear it out
Damn man, why we sell dope, pimp on these bitches, and gang bang?
In our D, and everywhere is the same thing
Niggas' feel ignored, feel oppressed
Down to strike a nigga out to get some stripes up on his chest
So we rob in the vest, and the same shit that's killin us
We got Obama, but capital hills still ain't feelin us
Make laws to get rid of us, wipe us off the map
If they take me out then you can bet your life that I'll be strapped
I'm so cold with it...

[Hook]
