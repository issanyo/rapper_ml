[Freddie Gibbs]
What you know, boy? (x14)

[Verse 1]
I’m still livin' like a dope dealer
And these streets they got no mercy on a broke nigga
Gangsta Island, so all my niggas gang bangers
Girls, come get your cook up
I came up with the 'cain slangers
And I grew up next door to the dopeman
Chevy red CL coupe clean as a coke can
DEA been doin' surveillance, they in the dope van
Nowadays they pay Walter Payton; that’s 34 bands
Yeah, I’m still livin' like a jack boy
Got your family wrapped up in tape, I’m 'bout the sack, boy
And I heard it ain’t where you from, it’s where you at, boy
Make sure every place that I’m at next to the strap, boy
Killin' them, shit from these verses put hoes in hearses
And these truckers need some product
To purchase some at their service
Used to sale my yellow and nextel play for the chirpers
Ain’t no doubt, we don’t check out CTE
They close the curtains

[Hook]
And I’m still, still livin' like a dope dealer
Finger on the trigger, I ain’t taking shit from no nigga
Still, I’m still livin' like a dope boy
Wrapping up the pack of drugs, traffic what you know, boy
And I’m still, still livin' like a dope dealer
Finger on the trigger, I ain’t taking shit from no nigga
Still, I’m still livin' like a dope boy
Wrapping up the pack of drugs, traffic what you know, boy

[Verse 2]
Still cashing that dope check
Guns and contraband on deck
Street said that I'm marked for death
And might be the one to get smoked next
Might fuck around, might beat it down
That ass round and that throat wet
You a pussy boy, straight cold TEC's
Got a hundred rounds, bitch, hold that
Bitch, hold that, bitch, hold up
Bitch, know what? That 4 bust
Bought a 14 of that straight hard
And served every geeker that rolled up
That straight trap with no raps with me
OT, but they pack with me
Moonwalkin' on dope, bitch
I know real niggas on Jackson Street
25th, 49th, Cali kush over night
Come back to my store, dawg
But make sure you got your order right
And my shop might close up
So make sure you put your orders in
Just another day another dollar
Duckin' court again
Wrappin' up the pack of drugs, traffic watchin' out
Winter, summer, spring, fall
Nigga, shovel snow
And if I could I’d dig a tunnel straight to Mexico
Pass me my strap
I think the police at my door, because I’m…

[Hook]
And I’m still, still livin' like a dope dealer
Finger on the trigger, I ain’t taking shit from no nigga
Still, I’m still livin' like a dope boy
Wrapping up the pack of drugs, traffic what you know, boy
And I’m still, still livin' like a dope dealer
Finger on the trigger, I ain’t taking shit from no nigga
Still, I’m still livin' like a dope boy
Wrapping up the pack of drugs, traffic what you know, boy
