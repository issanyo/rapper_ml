[Verse 1]
You like my
You like my
You like my
Morning, my light, my love, my heart, my soul
The only one I relate to
You've been looking for some one on one time
So let me pick you up and Ima take you on a date boo
Everything I want and need
Am I in love? oh yes indeed
Only woman that I ever met in my life that had me tricking off all my extra cheese
Been in jail and I bled for you
You know the typical things that Fred'll do
And you remember back in the days
When I was 17, momma caught me laying in the bed with you
Ima open up doors for you, diss all my hoes for you
You put me in my own world, make a niggas toe curl, like a real girl supposed to do
Plus I must admit I get sad when you away
I just can't live this life without you, I can't get through my day
One summer we had to break up cause you couldn't deal with the heat
Everybody in the hood wanna say that you a stone cold freak
They hit it last week, but I don't listen to a peep
Uh... this might sound like I'm simping
Y'all might just say I'm tripping
But you know a player gotta maintain
I don't flame Jane, I don't complete my mission
Your sense, your texture, your touch, I'm in lust
When I roll up with a couple blunts that roll with me, whats up?
One more puff, I wanna touch

[Hook]
I wanna touch, wanna feel you
Can't ride without you by my side
I guess it's something when I'm near you
That keeps me on a natural high
I wanna touch, wanna feel you
Can't ride without you by my side
I guess it's something when I'm near you
That keeps me on a natural high

And I...
I love you mary, mary, baby
And I...
Don't go nowhere without my baby
And I...
I love you mary, mary, baby
And I...
Don't go nowhere without my baby
And I...

[Verse 2]
Must say I do to you, so let's jump the broom
First time that we met, no sweat
Had to get you undressed up in my uncle's room
Sweet as two cherry pies
Red hair, green eyes
Gotta switch up flavors and colors, she accessorize
On the real, if you came as a meal, I would lick you fresh off the plate
Woke up this morning, brushed my teeth and kissed you fresh out the gate
Yeah Ima fool for you, let them niggas hate
When I don't bring you 'round my homies say I'm handcuffing
Fuck em, they straight, they straight
They know you stay on deck
I make sure you stay fresh
Every time that I roll up, baby done shown up, wrapped in my favorite dress
That purple or that peach
Optimo, Swisher Sweets
Some fools can't move off that Mary
Freddie G never miss a beat
It might sound like I'm simping
Y'all might just say I'm tripping
But you know a player gotta maintain
I don't flame Jane, I don't complete my mission
Your smell, your texture, your touch, I'm in lust
When I roll up with a couple blunts that roll with me, whats up?
One more puff, I wanna touch
