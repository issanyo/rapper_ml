[Prelude]
Had to get that pitch on a bitch
Smack it up, flip it, and rub it down

[Hook]
Cause I be bout grindin', G-piece full of diamonds
Grindin', wrist piece change the climate
And there she go, nigga
I bet she go, nigga
Cause I be grindin', G-piece full of diamonds
Grindin', wrist piece change the climate
And there she go, nigga
I bet she go, nigga

[Verse 1]
Cause I be grindin', G-piece full of diamonds
Pretty bitch blinded, wrist piece change the climate
I beat that thang up out the lining
Side to side and from behind it
Bitch, I choose through buku bitches
On my line but nevermind it
I be movin', drinkin', drug abusin'
Yeah, smoked out, could fear the flute, but I'm coolin'
Yeah, got that backwood filled with strong and I'm loaded
Yeah, got a pack and a gang of straps for my soldiers
Yeah
I remember them nights when a nigga couldn't eat that much
Truth be told yo these groupie hoes
They used to turn their nose, they wouldn't give no fucks
Cars are black, I'm down, pull the 'Lac around
Bust a lick behind tint
Nigga, I was born with no windows and a pot to piss
That's why a rapping-ass nigga can't tell me shit

[Hook]
Bout grindin', G-piece full of diamonds
Grindin', wrist piece change the climate
And there she go, nigga
I bet she go, nigga
Cause I be grindin', G-piece full of diamonds
Grindin', wrist piece change the climate
And there she go, nigga
I bet she go, nigga

[Verse 2]
Cause I be grindin', G-piece full of diamonds
Need to claim your ho, entertain your ho
Where your bitch? Can't find her?
Giving answers back, sending nasty texts
She with the VVS its straight blindin'
White girl and a Mexican
They bucket naked then I turned them out on that powder
And I be rollin', what y'all niggas smokin'?
They be shuck-and-jivin', I was I-fivin'
Got the killa pack from East Oakland
So I sent my bitch a load told the bitch to go drop it off, head shopping
Used to wait for niggas, had the 'caine for niggas
Had them killers at your door knocking, nigga, like that
I remember them nights when a nigga had to rob to stay afloat
Niggas from the other side was at my throat
Met my homeboy mobbin', slanging dope
Niggas trying to live straight, legit
Got a bird from the H trying to rock your bitch
Nigga came from a crumb to a motherfuckin' brick
So a rapping-ass nigga can't tell me shit

[Hook]
