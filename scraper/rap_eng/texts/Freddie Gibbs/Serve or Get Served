[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Slammin' look it up bitch I'm the definition of it
Make that hardcore thuggin' shit could care less if the bitches love it
But they do cause I stay true they rushin' takin' pictures of a
Gangsta trill as Bobby Seale bitch I'm the new rendition of a
Real nigga reputable reputation
Pockets get too low I heat the stove up with no hesitation
Find a block and pick a spot to eat like I got reservations
Lay you to rest if you can't relate to my new revelations
No this ain't no coke-rap no I don't promote that
I simply illustrate my life I live it as I wrote that
Ye I served some geekers took some trips and brought some dope back
But that don't make me harder than nobody you can quote that
I represent the low-down, low-class, 20-dollar dope bag
Drop you for your mutha-fuckin last with our broke ass
Cause either you the server or the ma-fucker gettin' served
Couldn't wait to load it in his pipe and let it burn
