Uh

[Verse 1]
Fresh out of G.I., nigga
Wake up, sell dope, and get high, nigga
East-side to the death
Fire to the chest, last real nigga left
Much love to Lynda B
Who raised me in the G, profane as you can see
Always told me I could be anything I want to be
Anybody tell you different, then fuck 'em cause they'll be
The ones assed out
I've been booed, hated, and gassed out
In my own city, now I'm the nigga they ask 'bout
Used to hit the ATM and couldn't get no cash out
Pockets hurting, had to resort to pulling that mask out
Doing dirt to these dope boys
Tell 'em, "Bitch, if you ain't bumping with me, then you ain't making no noise"
Some incidents, I wrote 'em off as insignificant
I swear some nights I signed my own death certificate
Fucking around, thuggin' it for pennies on the dollar
Cause true niggas die, but don't nobody die with honor
In the ghetto
Now tell me what's the honor in getting smoked
By your own color
Out here selling stones to cluckers
Lord I mean well
You gotta let me in heaven, cause I done seen hell
Barrels of three-fifty-seven's
Up in a nigga wife mouth, cause he ain't got all the cash
We should lay this nigga down or he might come back and blast
That's the dilemma
A sinister sinna, a cold killa
The piece of shit my mama pushed out before the placenta
Gangsta G-I-
B-B-S, fuck all the rest
Peep my shit on DJBooth.net, get the adress
If you need the killer kush head west
And then ship it to the Mid
These niggas is on it soon as they see it
You sick of blowing backyard bush, put in your bid
You smell it before I crack the lid
Fuck with the kid
Freddie Gibbs

[Refrain]
Understandable smooth ish
That murderers move with
Thug it and show respect, but don't be nobody's fool, bitch
Understandable smooth ish
That murderers move with
Better watch the bitches you laying and the niggas you cool with
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 2]
And I'm back, like I left my muhfucking weed
No axe, but like a lumberjack, I chop trees
Everyday, niggas go to jail, snitch, and cop pleas
Type of shit that clog up the pipeline and stop cheese
Ain't that 'bout a bitch
Nigga been holding your money for like a week and shit
It's time to do something to him
Make sure you rolling solo dolo and you put something through him
All it take is one nigga fucking up, the club get ruined
Better watch the bitches you laying and the niggas you cool with
Thug it and show respect, but don't be nobody's fool, bitch
Cause rap is full of fake gangbangers and false sets
Niggas rap and talk about it, but niggas ain't walked that
In the club, guns hidden in the DJ booth
Gangsta Gibbs keep it gutter 'til I see Jes√∫s
Hella military weapons, like I seen Beirut
Them niggas duck when them thangs let loose
It's Freddie Gangsta Gibbs, nigga

[Refrain]
