[Intro]
The World’s Freshest you bitch
Cha
Uh Yeah
Bet you be about
You know I wanna do it[x3]
Bitch you know I wanna do it
You know I wanna do it

[Verse 1:]
Uh Yeah
I wanna buss it open in the mornin’
Like presents on Christmas day
Dick was all she wanted
Ain’t nothing like them freaky bitches from California
That coochie juicy
Thumbin that booty when I’m bonin
Peep that from the back that show you
How sexy the lot can share
Freaky ho from Valley though she know that it’s a rap for that
Matter fact, some fool spent some racks and bought a ring for that
Freshly pack the magnets, keep them ratchets out my habitat
It’s obvious the shit I wanna do to you
I chillin with the quick so bring some bitches shorty
So go’on an get to it don’t ask permission
And I think I’m feelin you friend so let’s pull a switcheroo
Fucking you since 1 or 2
Out the door by 3 or 4
Who I share the dick with, shut yo lip with
That’s fo’ me to know
I need it tho
Some green to blow
Bitch go fuck yo check off
When its finshed know u fuckin’ wid a gangsta
Bitch

[Chorus:]
You know I wanna do it [x8]

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, I wanna fuck her in the afternoon
My bitch babysit, we fuck in the family room
Girl, I'm in the mood, so take that lil' fool to school
It's polo jaws on my balls,I don't fuck with you tonight
Low fit in that Versace light?, so cold if you rock it bright
Jump in on them monkeys, bitch, you monkey you went shoppin' right
4Gs on my car so tight, been purple barred with ice
Clean on them hunkeys, bitch, you monkey, I'm a star tonight
So make yo wish bitch, I'll straight legit, bitch
Whip em 3.5 to 36, now that big dick
Now make a wish bitch, I'm straight legit bitch
Whip one 3.5 to 36, now that big dick yea

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:] [Sir Michael Rocks]
So if you see me with tricks, you know I just hit a jug
You wanna shine with a nigga, I think you definitely should
Cause when I step on the set, I fuck yo rep in the hood
But I got a rep in Tibet, I pull the Tech on a monk
A real asshole, badboy, I don't play sports
The type of guy make your thighs get a divorce
That's right, anytime of the day you down for the ride
I'm findin' a way, rain, sleet, hail, snow, no job in the way
Look, homie, I stay hustlin' and toll takin'
These bitch niggas, I can't fail them
I can't imagine that type of life you livin'
Ain't no champagne where you sittin'
Ain't a damn thing on yo body fittin'
You watchin' Twilight, nigga
But all the thotties that you ain't gettin'
I don't give a fuck
They shadow clones
They wanna be us
Bussing my cut
Being the blood and guts
You gotta bless the bottle
It seems the only kingdom that we read in bibles
Is closer than we really know
Just let me remind you

[Chorus]
