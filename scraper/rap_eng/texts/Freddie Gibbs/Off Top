[Hook]
Off of the top
I just pulled up in the truck, and pulled off in the drop
Off of the top
I bought it soft and I chopped it and turned it to rocks

[Verse 1]
Thug wit me
Chopstick, my stick, keep six guns with me
Passenger seat and my bitch packing I know she gon bust with me
Yeah, swooping yo street, I pop a nigga she go on the run with me
Whip a brick, ship a ton with me
Twist a wood burn a lung with me
Seven bitches in the tub with me
Actin' mannish at the Caesars Palace
I was on the trap phone speaking Spanish
On the other end waiting on the package
Stuff 100 packets in the Craftmatic
Got my crack cooked by a crack addict
Microwave 'caine on a blade
Since I made a million ain't shit been the same
When I made a million seen my niggas change
Bout to flex on niggas make 'em feel the pain
Eastside boy the whole squad eat
On massage seats switching lanes
Necklace filled with water
Wrist is filled with water, 20,000 on the pinky ring
Eastside boy the whole squad eat
On massage seats switching lanes
Fuck nigga proof, bitch nigga proof
Whipping rolls so the system in the roof
Show you bitches how a rich nigga do
Still down to rob a rich nigga crew
Cocaina catch a beat down
Canâ€™t shake the drop keep the heat down
Take my side bitches to Felipe Chow
Give me 50,000 for the freestyle nigga

[Hook]
Off of the top
I just pulled up in the truck, and pulled off in the drop
Off of the top
I bought it soft and I chopped it and turned it to rocks

[Outro]
Thug with me
Chopstick, my stick, keep six guns with me
Passenger seat and my bitch packing I know she gon' bust with me
