[Verse: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, Nigga we made it. E-S to the G-N baby. Nigga we made it

I think its been a minute since I killed a motherfucker but I feel it motherfucker
Cause everyday I look up in the mirror and say Freddie you the realest motherfucker
East Side baby face nigga no lie. Sell a brick and catch a case nigga dont try
Cause they dont wanna see a nigga, more ties, so high, gold wires, four tires, when I roll by
I hurdle niggas, gotta hit em, he dont injury me physically but this shit never hinder me cause I been a G
I took a look inside my heart and it was empty so really their ain't no love or pitty left for the enemy

If I dont get it through the motherfucking music I show up with them shooters, bitch ima killa til my death date damn
