[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, Diego, roll me one up, my nigga
Yeah, yeah, Kane, yeah

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
The future started yesterday, nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga
I admit that I was timid at a younger age, nigga
Daddy asked me what I wanna be, I said, "A paid nigga"
Whippin' extras out the pot, I gave myself a raise, nigga
Heaven sent, I can't remember the last time I prayed, nigga
So the Devil introduced me to cookin' cocaine, nigga
On the blade, seven days, ain't bathe or shave, nigga
I was thuggin' with my trey eight
Motherfuck a president, I got a Presidential Day-Date
I run a check up like a Chase bank
The police open up the package if your shipment come a day late
I just beat a rape case, groupie bitch I never fucked
Tried to give me ten for some pussy that I never touched
At a certain level, system tried to test a nigga's nuts
Nigga hire like eleven lawyers, had to level up, yeah

[Chorus: Brittany B & Freddie Gibbs]
Living this life, just me myself and I
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up
If I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up
Living this life, just me myself and I
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up
And if I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
The future started yesterday nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga
Had a baby, now my daughter gettin' up in age, nigga
When I die I bet she say, "My daddy was a paid nigga"
'Round the world, jail system like a slave trade, nigga
Got me in this foreign prison, monkey in a cage, nigga
Bail paid, locked me up for an extra 30 days, nigga
Barely let us use the shower, ain't bathed or shaved, nigga
I was sittin' in a cell missin' show dates
Commissary late, I'm postin' pictures with the toothpaste
Barely eat the food, stress'll make a nigga lose weight
Enter the mental of a nigga that wish he knew his fate
Shit these bitches do to try to get your cash
Erica visit, can't wipe her tears from behind the glass
Choppin' the porcelain up for years, said I'm suckin' glass
I beat the DEA and the task, now I'm on my ass

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Future started yesterday, nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga
Donald Trump gon' chain us up and turn back to slaves, nigga
Got the recipe for dope, my reparations paid, nigga
Feel like that at some point, really I should feel ashamed, nigga
They kill us, we killin' us, but that is not the way, nigga
Money tree up in the stripper club, I'm throwin' shade, nigga
Did destruction on your flow when I paved the lane, nigga
Chest to chopper, blow your chest out where your heart at, nigga
Black Tony, Babyface, better scar that nigga
Sent the hit out, I'm just waitin' on the call back, nigga
Shoot them pussies, burn it up, don't bring the car back, nigga
Gangsta G, I fucked the industry, them crackers say I'm too aggressive
I turned myself into a boss without a fuckin' question
Six whips, ghetto nigga gotta be excessive
I came up on fried bologna, boy, what you expected?
What you expected?

[Chorus: Brittany B & Freddie Gibbs]
Living this life, just me myself and I
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up
If I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up
Living this life, just me myself and I
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up
And if I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up

[Outro: Brittany B]
Ooh, I will be alright
Ooh, I will live my life
Ooh, I will be alright
Ooh, I will live my life
