[Intro]
Yeah, Kane
(I took a stripper bitch home and I beat it to pieces)
Freaky bitch like Dominique, you know what I'm sayin'
Kane season
(I just did 50 cities in a row, I just did 50 chickens in a row)
Let's go, let's go

[Chorus]
Quarter mill worth of jewels, these niggas leasin'
Ball so hard, my haters in the bleachers
I just fucked four bitches at Four Seasons
Money made me forget, I got amnesia
Quarter mill worth of jewels, these niggas leasin'
Ball so hard, got haters in the bleachers
I just fucked four bitches at Four Seasons
Money made me forget, I got amnesia

[Verse 1]
Ayy, quarter mill worth of jewels, these niggas leasin'
Amen, put 24 carats in my Jesus
I got the quarter kilo and I beat it to pieces
Feds snatched a nigga up, I caught amnesia
Yeah, back to back to back both times
Baby mama in the sky box and the side bitch sittin' court side
I'm in H-town, let her ride the Rocket
Got a bad bitch on the north side
Broke a pack down with a Vice Lord
On the west side of the Chi-town, nigga
Yeah, I just did 50 chickens in a row
I just did 50 cities in a row
Back to back Benz, Bentley in a row
Slangin' that dog sign to the row
I donâ€™t play households, gotta go
Back to back Keisha, Britney in a row
Slangin' that dog sign to the row, let's go, let's go

[Chorus]
Quarter mill worth of jewels, these niggas leasin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ball so hard, my haters in the bleachers (in the bleachers, yeah)
I just fucked four bitches at Four Seasons
Money made me forget, I got amnesia
Quarter mill worth of jewels, these niggas leasin' (quarter mil, bitch)
Ball so hard, got haters in the bleachers
I just fucked four bitches at Four Seasons
Money made me forget, I got amnesia

[Verse 2]
Yeah, quarter mill on the whip, bitch, ain't no leases
I just fucked four bitches at Four Seasons
I got a stripper bitch, took her home, beat it to pieces (woop, woop, woop)
Girl searched a nigga phone, I caught amnesia
Yeah, back to back to back both times
Took a bitch from the cheap seats from the nose bleeds to the court side (I did)
Told the haters stand with young Freddy Kane on the East side, that's the dope side (let's go)
Nigga bought dope, nigga, sold dope on the East side, that's the dope side, nigga
Ayy, I just did 50 chickens in a row
I just did 50 cities in a row
Back to back Benz Bentley in a row
Thought they hit everybody with the chopper time
But we put the bitches in a row
Hood bein' murdered for 'em
Even if they had it make a nigga dig it out the floor, let's go, let's go

[Chorus]
Quarter mill worth of jewels, these niggas leasin'
Ball so hard, my haters in the bleachers
I just fucked four bitches at Four Seasons
Money made me forget, I got amnesia
Quarter mill worth of jewels, these niggas leasin'
Ball so hard, got haters in the bleachers
I just fucked four bitches at Four Seasons
Money made me forget, I got amnesia

[Outro]
Back to back to back both times (I did it)
Sold dope, nigga, both times (let's go)
Back to back to back both times
Sold dope, nigga, both times
