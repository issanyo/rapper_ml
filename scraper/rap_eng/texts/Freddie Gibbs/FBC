[Intro]
Yeah
Bitch hit me when I was on my way to this mothafucka
She was like, nigga, "Meet me at the mall"
I'm like shit, bitch, "Bitch whatchu gonna buy me?"
You know what I'm sayin', bitch?

[Chorus]
Fendi bubble coat, rockin' up the dope
Fendi bubble coat, rockin' up the dope
Fendi bubble coat, rockin' up the dope
Smoke it on the spot then get your shit to go

[Verse 1]
I might pull in that Benz if its bool
Car so clean I make the bitch take of her shoes
Drippin' water, nothing monkey on my jewels
Give me good brain but that pussy do the fool
Fendi bubble coat, rockin' up the dope
All my smokers smoke it on the spot and get they shit to go
I just left out Long Beach with ten bricks, Iâ€™m fucking w the locs
I [?] just like Scarface on that banana boat
I jumped off the porch and jump straight on the blade
Smokers on that D block keep a nigga paid
Gucci on my runners, put that on the gang
I know some famous rappers snitchin' (Fin Ball), I won't say no names

[Chorus]
Fendi bubble coat, rockin' up the dope
Fendi bubble coat, rockin' up the dope
Fendi bubble coat, rockin' up the dope
Smoke it on the spot then get your shit to go

[Verse 2]
Buckingham Palace with the Palace on, I'm high as fuck
15 grams of yayo on the table, bitch come line 'em up
Brought 2 pounds of killer on my tour bus, but that ain't enough
She want my commitment, throw that pussy, but that ain't enough
Ain't enough, ain't enough, bitch you lame as fuck
Had you nigga sick, he rode the bench while I was layin' up
4 AM your ho be stayin' up, bitch ain't no waitin' up
My packs so loud I wake the neighbors up, I'm whippin' babies up like

[Chorus]
Fendi bubble coat, rockin' up the dope
Fendi bubble coat, rockin' up the dope
Fendi bubble coat, rockin' up the dope
Smoke it on the spot then get your shit to go
