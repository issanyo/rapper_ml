(Fucking right, fucking right)
If your bitch wanna fuck with me
(She fucking right, fucking right)
She keep pulling all on my jeans
(She fucking right, fucking right)
Every time I step out I ball
(Fucking right, fucking right)
Cause I ain't got time to worry about y'all
(You fucking right)
There's ten bad bitches knocking at the door
(You fucking right)
They all bad bitches
(You motherfucking right, you fucking right)
Theres ten bad bitches knocking at the door
(You fucking right)
They all bad bitches
(You motherfucking right, you fucking right)

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
I do it for my city, that's never gonna stop
Fly city nigga, from my head to my socks
She want a m√©nage and you thinking I'm not
Won't give me head while the other one watch
Take her to the crib, it's just one of them nights
Ain't loving your bitch but I'm loving my life
You ain't gotta worry who the illest on the mic
Million dollar flow, I got a million dollar life
Loving how I'm living but it came at a price
Million dollar nigga got a million dollar wife
Try to push me to the edge but I never fell off
Had to get it with my niggas, now we living in a loft
Niggas wanted me to fail, I don't know what to tell y'all
Haters on my paper, when they get the hell off?
Came back, I had to get it any time I said hello
Said a nigga hated me into a motherfucking buff
Stay the fuck out of my business, can I get a witness?
You're talking to a nigga in the trenches
My own soul relentless, ball with you niggas while y'all watch the game from the benches
Now I'm in the spot, I don't need zone
Getting on the ones I like
She know when to fuck all night, man, she looking at me like you

[Hook: Jon Connor]
Fucking right, fucking right
If your bitch wanna fuck with me
She fucking right, fucking right
She keep pulling all on my jeans
She fucking right, fucking right
Every time I step out I ball
Fucking right, fucking right
Cause I ain't got time to worry about y'all
You fucking right
Theres ten bad bitches knocking at the door
You fucking right
They all bad bitches
You motherfucking right, you fucking right
Theres ten bad bitches knocking at the door
You fucking right
They all bad bitches
You motherfucking right, you fucking right

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
It's ten geekers knocking at my trap door
Young Gibbs up in there whipping, working, serving blow
And these FEDs up in my face like gangsta, what you know?
Cause every time I leave the booth I'm a suspect, Flow'll murder them
Finna cop a leg, and a wing, goddamn it
Real muhfuckas in the game, understand it
I was ready for the chips with the plug and the bricks
Didn't understand a link but my bitch spoke Spanish
I'm a motherfucking Midwest rider, Gary, Indiana, east sider
Only thing I serve is that fire, dope blunt, cut, no liar
Fucking right, fucking right, nigga wanna talk this shit then hear my fucking life, fucking life
Nigga, I was in the dope spot, servin licks all fuckin' night, fuckin' night
Young pimp nigga with a limp, puttin dick to your fucking wife, fucking wife
And she gonna hit my phone cause she said you

[Hook: Jon Connor]
Fucking right, fucking right
If your bitch wanna fuck with me
She fucking right, fucking right
She keep pulling all on my jeans
She fucking right, fucking right
Every time I step out I ball
Fucking right, fucking right
Cause I ain't got time to worry about y'all
You fucking right
Theres ten bad bitches knocking at the door
You fucking right
They all bad bitches
You motherfucking right, you fucking right
Theres ten bad bitches knocking at the door
You fucking right
They all bad bitches
You motherfucking right, you fucking right

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
When they let me in the spot, bitches rock and send me
Got me feeling like I'm not
The nigga that was already now I feel like I've landed on another planet
Running in circles, my circle got me on a million dollar yacht
Funny how shit change, niggas looking at me like this shit just came
Out the clear blue, niggas talking shit, I can't hear you
Yeah, I knew my vision was realistic when I didn't have a clear view
Fuck what you say, nigga, leave your mouth, nigga, fuck what you say
Sightseeing ass nigga, get the fuck out the way
Say I'm lost, same dreams, gonna wake up, a million dollars stuffed in a safe
Feel good, shit like a massage to a nigga, couldn't believe it
It felt like a mirage to a nigga, I've evolved with you niggas to my eyes
Real recognize real and you look like camouflage to a nigga
Out the Midwest, did you niggas leave in that Michigan? Yes
Indiana, Gary and it's scary, we probably should be up in a cemetery
But we focus on this money and we try to be the best
I told y'all this shit is just paper so we blow it every night, fuck Ks
Hold it down for the city that made us
And represent for the hood that raised us
