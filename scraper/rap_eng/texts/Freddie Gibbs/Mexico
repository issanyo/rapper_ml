[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, nigga
You know I pull up in a "What-the-fuck-is-that?"
You know when the doors don’t go up
They just swing to the side a little bit
J hop up on top, fuck these bitches man, shit’s crazy
Fargo…

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
New Givenchy coat it's like we’re selling dope
Since I started pimping I don’t sell no more
I got bitches down to 4-0-1 and 4-1-0
So I ain’t got no time to sit and talk 'bout so and so
My whip color look like Rihanna
And all my bitches love designer
We flip diego like Quintana
That’s why this new Givenchy coat look like I’m sellin’ dope

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I wake up to twist up that kush in the morning, throw on my rollie
Check my phone, I got a call from my homie, he need that OG
Gangsta G, I run a mob like I’m Tony, I sell that Tony
Just gave all my youngsters Glock-9s and 40s, them my lil whoadies
Trap my dope spot, my OG used to call me, bag up that doggie
She can’t fuck I drop that bitch on the corner, yeah bitch I’m balling
Police hit your shit then bitch you don’t know me, no we ain’t homies
Just got all my youngsters Glock-9s and 40s, them my lil whoadies yeah

[Bridge: Freddie Gibbs]
Riding in my Rental, got a Rover in my pocket though
Hundred fifty stacks about to take a trip to Mexico
Chopper on my lap I’m blowing gas, hit a Texaco
Hundred fifty stacks about to take a trip to Mexico

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Just put all my bitches off in a foreign, them my lil whoadies
I just whipped that brick that bitch driving for me, that bitch my roadie
Police hit my shit the charge was baloney, bailed out that morning
Gangsta G, I run the mob like I’m Tony, now sell that Tony
Slap them ass on, got my hands on the kilo, I sell the nino
Straight casino, bitch I'm the Tarantino, chop up an eagle
I wake up and whip that dope in the morning, threw on my rollie
Just get all my youngsters Glock-9s and 40s, them my lil whoadies
