[Pre-Chorus: Phonte]
You're a keeper and you know it
I'm lost in a bad dream
Heavy clouds, thunder rolling
'Cause we don't see the same things

[Chorus: Phonte]
So if you need a change of mind
If you need another way
Release you from this pain of mine
And you can have a new day

[Verse 1: Phonte]
Yeah
Late at night tossing, turning (yeah)
Thought that I'd go insane (yeah)
Thinking maybe I deserve it (yeah, yeah)
Wondered if you felt the same yeah

[Chorus: Phonte]
So if you need a change of mind
If you need another way
I release you from this pain of mine
And you can have a new day

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I was trynna get the cake up, cake up
J’s lookin' for the wake up, wake up
Foolish ways never break her or shake her
All we ever do is break up to make up
Sorta like a nigga raised up, we raised up
Nothin' really when you stayed down and came up
Flew some bitches out to Vegas, Jamaica
She ain’t never slow the pitch down or change up
Baby girl, I can ice your wrists, I can ice your fingers
You a life investment, you a life decision
First time in my life I made the right decision
Cut the coca then I cocaina white the Bentley
Locked down, she was like a nigga co-defendant
When my back against the wall, girl I know you with me yeah
Hot sex in the morning under sun rays
We don’t leave the crib on Sundays
You the one yeah yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Phonte]
You're a keeper and you know it
I'm lost in a bad dream
Heavy clouds, thunder rolling
'Cause we don't see the same things

[Chorus: Phonte]
So if you need a change of mind
If you need another way
Release you from this pain of mine
And you can have a new day
