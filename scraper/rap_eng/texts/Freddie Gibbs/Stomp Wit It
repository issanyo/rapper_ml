[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Ladies and gentleman
Yeah
You are now tuned into the sounds of Freddie Gibbs
And the one and only DJ Finger Roll
Ugh, come on
Now bring that beat back

[Interlude: Freddie Gibbs]
Stomp wit' it
Stompda-stomp wit' it
Stompda-stomp wit' it
Stompda-stomp wit' it
Stompda-stomp wit' it
Stompda-stomp wit' it
Stompda-stomp wit' it
Stompda-stomp wit' it

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Yo, I'm the homie wit' no [?], keep it cool
You thinkin' you about the body? You a fool
You see me in the club, probably I got the tool
Owners want me to obey they policy, I refuse
I just walk up in the spot wit' my clapper up in my pocket
Keep yo' distance, shut yo' mouth, you don't want me to have to pop it
Man I'd rather beat you down 'til yo' lungs collapse
I heard he was talkin' gibberish, so where that nigga at?
There he go, I'mma hit him wit' uppercuts and elbows
Stomp him in my timberland, force one's is shell toes
Leave his face stuck to the dance floor like velcro
Think that he got plans of gettin' me back? Hell no
I'm about to blow so I don't respect haters
They ain't even in the game, they nothin' but spectators
I ain't wit' that dumb shit, I don't play that punk shit
If you got 99 problems then I'mma be yo' hundred

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
What? Run up on me if you want to, want to
Don't be surprised when I stomp you, stomp you
Straight flat, I'm about to straight snap
Got your people movin' back like hey, hey, hey
Run up on me if you want to, want to
Don't be surprised when I stomp you, stomp you
Straight flat, I'm about to straight snap
Got your people movin' back like hey, hey, hey

[Post-Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Now all my niggas say hey, hey, hey
Now all my ladies say hey, hey, hey
Now everybody say hey, hey, hey
Now sing along wit' me hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
A lot of rappers say they wanna challenge me
But in all actuality niggas ain't ready to battle me
You high up on your horse, I can bring you back to reality
Give you plenty of agony leading up to yo' tragedy
Damn homie chill out, yo I'm keepin' my cool
Man I don't wanna hurt nobody, I just wanna make 'em move
I just wanna hear the DJ spinnin' my record
I got some honeys waiting for me, I'mma dip in a second
But, before I skip out I gotta get my point across
Let these haters know what I'm workin' wit' then I brush 'em off
Homie I'm about to terrorize the game
If you don't know it already then I'mma tell you my name
It's Freddie G to the izz-I, B to the bizzy
S, oh yes the best rapper from the Gizzy
Matter of fact, I am the illest rapper from Indi-ana
Keep your opinion, it doesn't really, matter

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
What? Run up on me if you want to, want to
Don't be surprised when I stomp you, stomp you
Straight flat, I'm about to straight snap
Got your people movin' back like hey, hey, hey
Run up on me if you want to, want to
Don't be surprised when I stomp you, stomp you
Straight flat, I'm about to straight snap
Got your people movin' back like hey, hey, hey

[Post-Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Now all my niggas say hey, hey, hey
Now all my ladies say hey, hey, hey
Now everybody say hey, hey, hey
Now sing along wit' me hey, hey, hey
