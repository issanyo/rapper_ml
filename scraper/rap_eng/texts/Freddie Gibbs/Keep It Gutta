[2Pac *sampled from Juice*]
Crazy man
You know what, when you said that last time I was kinda trippin' right?
But now, you right, I am crazy
But you know what else?
I don't give a fuck

[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Man [?] right now dog straight up
I'm just gon' voice my opinion a lil bit
Fuck how you feel
Yeah, ugh
Yeah, yeah, Freddie Gibbs
Yeah man
Let's get it

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Ayo I'm from the gutta
And I've been livin' gutta
So I'mma keep it gutta
Until I'm gone brotha
So where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
This is dedicated to the cookies of the industry
I got enough friends, I'm lookin' for enemies
Cause I'm a brand new problem you gotta deal wit'
I represent for them niggas spittin' that real shit
These muthafuckas stack a little bit of change and claim that they the hardest
And y'all lames go out and buy his garbage
I gotta keep it real, the rap game is wack now
Even these niggas from immature tryna rap now
I'mma give niggas some food for thought
Go trash that bullshit you bought
Before yo' ass get caught in the wrong hood
Bumpin' the wrong shit
Niggas'll laugh at you, leave you gettin' ya dome split
I'm about to drive these niggas insane
And I know they wanna diss me back, so while they pickin' they brain
I'll be chillin' in the regal homes
Witcha girl in the backseat givin' me dome, gettin' her eagle on

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Ayo I'm from the gutta
And I've been livin' gutta
So I'mma keep it gutta
Until I'm gone brotha
So where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?
Ayo I'm from the gutta
And I've been livin' gutta
So I'mma keep it gutta
Until I'm gone brotha
So where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Yo I'mma tell a true story about my nigga Pimp
He bumped into this nigga Chingy sittin' in his whip
He told him he was from the G and Chingy sped off
I guess he thought he was gon' blow his fuckin' head off
That nigga soft and the music that he make is for certified cookies
The rhymes he be spittin' is soft as wet pussy
You went plat' I'm congratulating that
But you ain't the king of the Midwest, your shit is whack
Man I rap for them niggas that hustle out of the crack spot
Niggas don't be ridin' around bumpin' that jackpot
Man trust me, my hood ain't feelin' him
His voice sound like he been inhalin' helium
This is how I get down
You may beat me at spittin' raps, we can spit rounds nigga
Lay him down with the fo' pound
And have my people run a muck on ya whole town
Youse a clown

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Ayo I'm from the gutta
And I've been livin' gutta
So I'mma keep it gutta
Until I'm gone brotha
So where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?
Ayo I'm from the gutta
And I've been livin' gutta
So I'mma keep it gutta
Until I'm gone brotha
So where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Yo y'all ain't ready for the way I'm 'bout to take rap
Am I supposed to be happy now that Mase back?
I seen a ad in a book: Mase coming soon
But really though, what's the difference between him and Loon?
Man I don't know, man it seem like P. Diddy done lost his mind
He picked up Ball & G cause he lost his Shyne, get it?
I guess he needed some gangstas on his roster
Them band muthafuckas wasn't nothin' but imposters
A lotta y'all rappers suck to me
And you wouldn't have a deal if it was up to me
But it ain't so, do what ya do
Same way Pac shut niggas down, I can do it to you
I'm real muthafucka, if I talk it, I lived it
I ain't takin' notihin' back, if I said it, I meant it
I don't really give a damn about you bein' offended
Fuck wit' me and your career will get ended
Nigga what

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Ayo I'm from the gutta
And I've been livin' gutta
So I'mma keep it gutta
Until I'm gone brotha
So where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?
Where you at nigga?
Ayo I'm from the gutta
And I've been livin' gutta
So I'mma keep it gutta
Until I'm gone brotha
So where you at nigga? (where you at nigga?)
Where you at nigga? (where you at nigga?)
Where you at nigga? (where you at?)
Where you at nigga? (where you at?)

[Outro: Freddie Gibbs]
