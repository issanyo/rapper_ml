[Chorus]
Got a full clip and I ain't afraid to shoot
Said cool kids, they live forever
I get high, I get high
But you're always my parachute
Said moments don't last forever

[Post-Chorus]
It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day out
It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day out
It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day out
It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day out

[Verse 1: Skinny]
Don't know if you notice, I just want the paper, my love
Stuck up in the moment, I need to fly away now, my love
I'll hit you in the mornin', right now I'm super faded
Mary Jane my favorite, Mary Jane my favorite
See I'm just living in the moment
I don't hang around with phonys
Weed super loud, my pizza pepperoni
And my cars kinda old, but I love the way she roll
Still cost a 100k, on a good day, yeah that's kinda cold
All these hoes wanna sip my cup
Spend my dough, smoke all my drugs
They just wanna Netflix n' chill
I just wanna Netflix 'n fuck
See I don't really go out too much
Strangers wanna talk way too much
And I don't like to talk much these days
I barely leave the house much these days

[Chorus]
Got a full clip and I ain't afraid to shoot
Said cool kids, they live forever
I get high, I get high
But you're always my parachute
Said moments don't last forever

[Post-Chorus]
It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day out
It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day out
It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day out
It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day out

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I barely leave out the house these days
Smokin' on nothing less than an ounce these days
I need more money than I can count these days
Government diggin' in your account these days
Diamond G on my necklace if a nigga get paid
Kill all my enemies if a nigga gets sprayed
I need to pray to the father, readin' Elijah Muhammad, I know that only Allah can change my ways
I had a problem, used to get up in the mornin', drinkin' the medicine strapped to the bottle
Mix it with Ocean Spray, 'bout to get me some blow today
I'm gonna go put this dick in a model
I used to tuck a rock in the Buick, a youngin' was gettin' to it, I'm workin' the blade
Ride for my homies, that nigga that shot Ricky, I'm passenger seat with the gauge
I rolling up 65 with 50 things up in my ride
Cookin' up this pot it's just the way that I survive
Chokin' on that fire soon as I open my eyes
And I don't leave the house unless I got that .45

[Chorus]
Got a full clip and I ain't afraid to shoot
Said cool kids, they live forever
I get high, I get high
But you're always my parachute
Said moments don't last forever

[Post-Chorus]
It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day out
It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day out
It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day out
It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day out
