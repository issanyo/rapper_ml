[Hook: G-Wiz]
I bet this how LeBron feel
I know this how Juwan feel
Just loud, ain't no Reggie over here
'93 Bulls nigga, '96 Bulls nigga, '97 Bulls nigga, '98 Bulls nigga
Golden diamonds on my clique, bitch, we the champions

[Verse 1: G-Wiz]
Might hit the club with all my rings on
Might walk in church with all my chains on
Phil Jackson, I'm on my Zen
John Paxson, I'm going in
I might go with a gold roll? and a ball fake
I feel like Pippen on a fast break
These bitches hate the way I fade away
I'll quench your thirst with some Gatorade
I'm on the west drop-top with a parkay?
But her bitch six tre on some dope veins
In the streets I stick and move like Cassius Clay
Momma called him Clay, I called him Clay
Free throws with the eyes closed
I weigh my dope up with my eyes closed
Picture me and Gangsta Gibbs in them Diablos
Midwest reppin' up to Nap-town? to Chicago

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I bet this how LeBron feel
Hit it quick then dip, now how your broad feel
Straight G.I. dough-boy my Forgi's is big as cartwheels
Worried, broke down and shamed, disgusted that's how your mom feel
My OGs sit back like Juwan
Frederico Soprano baby, your son a don
Nigga fuck the world, I'm a god, I crush this shit in my palm
FNH with murder cases, little nigga don't cross the line
'98 Bulls nigga
Test me, better have that tool with ya
So don't be nobody's fool nigga
Play niggas off like Bryon Russell, give hoes the flu nigga

[Hook]
