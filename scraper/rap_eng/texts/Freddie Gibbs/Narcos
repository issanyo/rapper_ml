[Hook]
Dope game hard
Rap game, rap game easy than a motherfucker
Diamonds on my motherfuckin' neck and wrist
You see this shit is breezy than a motherfucker
I get broke than a bitch
Put my feet all in the dope game
Chillin' in my granny basement
Probably dreamin' 'bout some cocaine

[Verse 1]
On the phone cussin' out my baby mama
She hate it 'cause I hang out with the killers and the robbers
Got a house in California and I flooded it with choppers
Met my plug and got a duffle bag of dope at Benihanas
Taught my youngin's how to wrap it up and pack and do it proper
Took 'em shoppin' got the car squattin' down on Forgiatos
You ain't fuckin' you a friend zone nigga, you a Roger
Freddie Kane still hang with the killers and the robbers
Thirty shots in the FN, fuck nigga
Why you got a chopper and you scared to bust, nigga?
Some nigga tried to kill me, man it's hard to trust niggas
But my momma raised a drug dealer, not a fuck nigga
I just, I just a hit a lick up at the mutherfuckin' brown house
Hit a nigga for a half a brick and lil bow wow
Came in with them motherfuckers they can lay them all down
Hit a nigga for a half a brick and lil bow wow, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Dope game hard
Rap game, rap game easy than a motherfucker
Diamonds on my motherfuckin' neck and wrist
You see this shit is breezy than a motherfucker
I get broke than a bitch
Put my feet all in the dope game
Chillin' in my granny basement
Probably dreamin' 'bout some cocaine

[Verse 2]
Dope game, fuck nigga
Why you got a chopper and you scared to bust, nigga?
Some nigga tried to kill me, man it's hard to trust niggas
But my momma raised a drug dealer, not a fuck nigga
I just, I just hit a lick and bought a motherfuckin' car lot
Foreign things, old school, nigga pull them all out
Pull up in some shit that blow the motherfuckin' wall out
Foreign things, old school, nigga pull them all out
I'm a pitbull at the stove with the raw, dog
Got him bending corners with the hard and the soft ball
Neighbors at my mama door he say he wanna talk, dog
Everyday buy a bag of hard and the soft ball
I just, I just hit a lick on some Dominicans in Naptown
Had em pissed I'm workin' from New York and laid em all down
Got em for some Yayo and a brick of Lil Bow Wow
E-S to the G-N man these niggas 'bout to bow down, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Dope game hard
Rap game, rap game easy than a motherfucker
Diamonds on my motherfuckin' neck and wrist
You see this shit is breezy than a motherfucker
I get broke than a bitch
Put my feet all in the dope game
Chillin' in my granny basement
Probably dreamin' 'bout some cocaine

[Outro]
Dope game, fuck nigga
Why you got a chopper and you scared to bust, nigga?
Some nigga tried to kill me, man that's all he trust, nigga
But my momma raised a drug dealer, not a fuck nigga
I just, I just a hit a lick up at the mutherfuckin' brown house
Hit a nigga for a half a brick of Lil Bow Wow
Came in with them motherfuckers they can lay them all down
Hit a nigga for a half a brick of Lil Bow Wow, yeah yeah
