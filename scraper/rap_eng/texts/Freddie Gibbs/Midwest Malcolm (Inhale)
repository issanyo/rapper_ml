(Freddie Gibbs)
Inhale, exhale this shit
That gangsta shit, gangsta shit
Some people ain't fit to this shit, ain't hip to this shit
But you know what I'm sayin, I'm gonna spit this shit
I tell motherfuckers like this, I tell 'em all the time
When the world becomes perfect, maybe I'll rap about that shit

(Verse 1)
It's on, and once again I bring niggas the realest
Viciously vivid, straight explosive, highly explicit
Got my broke ass off of my momma's couch and I started pitchin'
Cause bitches ain't checking for a nigga working at the Village
Slanging Volvos, pushing the bucket sedan four doors
I needed a Lexus coupe sittin' on 20's with a set of MOMOs
A young old soul so I stay in the frame
Let's put this thang up and get some paint and just throw my shit on them thangs
And I be rollin', shine but never let them know just what you holdin
Better keep that thing on tuck, I know niggas that's making bucks serving cain uncut
Used to pay me to take that dust on the Greyhound bus
Now I'm my own man, grown man, deal with my own dirt
Perfectly pounding the payment and purchase my own work
Benefit from the killer shit that's making my phone twerk
Say she don't know no Freddie G, well bitch do your homework
No hoes in my history can shit on Gibbs
Grew up amongst the crack babies and the flintstone kids
17th and Pennsylvania bitch, my whole fucking block poor
Couldn't afford a baby crib, I slept up in a sock drawer (damn)
Interscope they thought it was a joke but it was not so
They tried to have a nigga do that fast food pop flow
I'm secret with ingredients, my lyrics is home cooked
Some reefer and a yellow bitch that's thick as a phone book
All I need, a fool with the tools to succeed
Take this G out of me then you mix it with Cali weed
I would say that this shit turned me to a monster but bitch I've been a beast
Gangster Gibbs greasy as a church's chicken 20-piece
It should be mandatory that this shit is self-explanatory
Malcolm of the mid, no other nigga in my category
It's mandatory that this shit is self-explanatory
Malcolm of the mid, no other nigga in my category
