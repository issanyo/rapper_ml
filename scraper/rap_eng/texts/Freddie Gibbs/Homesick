[Intro: Big Time Watts & Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, yeah yeah
Hey, man, let me tell you something, man
I ain't gotta leave no motherfuckin' message
Yeah, yeah yeah
This Big Time motherfuckin' Watts man
When I call you answer the goddamn phone motherfucker
Yeah, yeah yeah
Freddie motherfuckin' Gibbs
Yeah, yeah yeah
I ain't no groupie, I'm your motherfuckin' uncle
Yeah, yeah yeah
Now answer the goddamn phone next time I call you, boy
Yeah, yeah yeah
Or I'ma come down there and beat your ass
Since I came home, police across the street takin' pictures right when I came home

[Verse 1]
Nigga get a watch, and a couple chains, think he harder than you
Drop the jewelry, grow some dreads, think he smarter than you
Please yourself or please your homies, man, what's harder to do?
Did some things in life I know I don't want my daughter to do
Shit, got a list of things I don't want my daughter to do
On the blade, tryna get paid, choppin' hard with the crew
Type of shit I did to make me feel a part of the crew
'Til I cut my niggas off, now I'm apart from the crew
I'm playin' my own so I cannot play all positions for my niggas
They hate me, pocket watchin', they got me distant from my niggas
Shit's so fake this days, I got's to keep a pistol around my niggas
Got me on some Grayson Allen shit, I'm trippin' on my niggas
Lord, Chevy dookie blue, on them 22's
Cali pack will send them bitches through, let them bitches move
Everyday I toke a couple Qs, serve that after school
Momma take my money, yeah, that's cool but she don't approve
Birds take a bath, dip them in the pool
'Bout to hit them bitches with the soda, watch them do the fool
Everyday I twerk a couple Qs, serve that after school
Momma take my money yeah, that's cool but she don't approve

[Chorus]
Since I came home, right when I came home
Since I came home, police across the street takin' pictures right when I came home
Since I came home, right when I came home
Since I came home, police across the street takin' pictures right when I came home

[Verse 2]
I ain't seen my nigga since I came home
Thought it'd be bottles and bitches right when I came home
Found out my problems was bigger right when I came home
Police 'cross the street takin' pictures right when I came home (snitch nigga)
I can't keep a bitch 'cause I can't feel the love
They always say there was somethin' there when there never was
I donate money to children, but I'm still sellin' drugs
Yeah, I get that yol' for the low-low but was I really plug?
Life was off my mental wasn't plugged in
Every day I pray to Lord, Allah don't snatch my plug out
Stay off the phone, ain't no service up in this drug house
Smell too strong to hit Sunday service, I'm shippin' drugs out
I ain't seen my nigga since I came home
Guess he somewhere gettin' that paper, he can't pick up the phone
Wish him the best, leave him 'lone and let him stay in his zone
And once he fall the fuck off then fuck him, he on his own

[Chorus]
Since I came home, right when I came home
Since I came home, police across the street takin' pictures right when I came home
Since I came home, right when I came home
Since I came home, police across the street takin' pictures right when I came home

[Outro]
I just almost lost it all, for my niggas
Just sat in the cell, ten thousand miles away from my child, for my niggas
It's when I realized I gotta start livin' for my child, and not my niggas, know what I'm sayin'?
I remember not havin' nothin' to read in the cell for a whole month you know what I mean?
The fuckin' guards took me to the library and all the books was in German and shit, you know what I'm sayin', nigga?
That almost broke me down you know
Erica flew all the way over there
Brought a nigga some books, know what I'm sayin'?
She held me down, know what I mean?
Through all the bullshit, all my bullshit she held me down
I love her for that
I'm back
And I ain't goin' nowhere this time
