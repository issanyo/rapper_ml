[Intro: Anthony White]
To keep on holdin' on, holdin' on
Holdin' on, holdin' on
To keep on holdin' on, holdin' on
Holdin' on, holdin' on

[Chorus: Anthony White]
No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)
No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)
No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)
No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, man
Man, I been out just thuggin' for a long time
Whippin' and workin', servin' em up on phone line
Four forty-eighths set me straight, break it down to all dimes
She brush me off, I was broke, now the pussy’s all mine
You can check a nigga pockets
Boy, I was raised up on crackers and Vienna sausage
Deep on the east right next to Marshalltown in the projects
We used to seed 'em at the liquor store and get to choppin'
Don’t reefer knock 'em, but I don’t thank police
But who do I answer first? To sell this work or either don’t eat
This price is on my head, way too heavy, can’t get no sleep
I pray that a nigga test me, never restin', ya’ll don’t know me
A motherfuckin' O.G., and I'm just out here tryna hold on
If it keeps ya tight then like I can’t write without the flows on
Fresh out the block, foreign model without then clothes on
ESGN till all the drugs and the hoes gone, bitch
Uh, fo' sho'

[Bridge: Anthony White]
Can't turn you loose, no, no
'Cause I need all the joy you bring
Hey, I can't let you go with nobody
'Cause I love you, baby, yes, I do (Yes, I do)

[Chorus: Anthony White]
No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)
No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)
No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)
No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)

[Verse 2: Anthony White]
Gonna give you everything you want
'Cause I gotta, gotta keep on holdin' on, holdin' on
I can't, I can't turn you
Can't let you go away no, no, away, no, no
Oh, you'll be the only girl, you'll be the only girl
Holdin' on
I can't, I can't turn you
Can't let you get away no, no, away, no, no

[Outro: Anthony White]
I can't turn you
I can't turn you (I can't, I can't, I can't)
Turn you (I can't, I can't, I can't)
I can't turn you
(Love)
