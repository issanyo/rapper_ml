[Intro]
I live my life illegal
I live my life illegal
For sure
I bright, I bright
That’s why I live illegal

[Hook]
All my life I live illegal don’t give a fuck bout the law
When my pockets reaching zero
I’m fresh out the ghost town similar to your town
I’m probably where it goes down
Keepin' them toes down around my way
All my life I live illegal don’t give a fuck bout the law
When my pockets reaching zero
I’m fresh out the ghost town similar to your town
I’m probably where it goes down
Keepin' them toes down around my way

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah I’ma ride this bitch until the tires ball
And I live by the sword so you know I'mma die right by my iron dog
Body full of holes and an empty clip
Look into my life how it ended quick
Caught these nigga's slippin'
But I guarantee I’ma take a couple of em with me when I leave these bitch
I’m destined to feel the flames, conscience? No, I live insane
Loco behind the wheel, fire up the kill and conceal the pain
Bustin' back is my only option, and that drive by shit been played out
It's cool to walk up and pop em, make sure you drop em
VLs, GDs, and Stones, serving these cluckers all they honor is a dollar my knocka
It ain't no structure, no teachers, it ain't no leadership to lean on
And the dope man ain't trippin as long as he can get his eat on
When I speak about the dope man
I ain't talkin bout yo neighborhood pusherman
I’m talkin' about them fools on capital hill that overlook us
Oversee us, it’s facetious how we can’t pick up the pieces
You young and black and you an endangered species
That’s why I live illegal

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Politicians prosecute us, punk polices try to shoot us
Pulled me over for a traffic stop, these fools pulled out they Rugers
Told us if we move then they gon put our faces on the news, and clap us in the back, ‘so just relax and don’t say nothing stupid
Just like they did Oscar Grant, just like they did Sean Bell
How you want it, death sentence on the spot, or life in the cell?
Either way we fucked up, the game is set up for us to fail
A few of these niggas might luck up and not get caught, but most of ‘em tell
Most of these niggas snitches setting up they own people
Got caught with a whole lotta bricks but he still out here on Chrome Regals
Wood kits, I’m surprised nobody knocked out his noodle
Witness Protected under pressure, this how niggas will do you
Niggas betray you, and it’s prolly ‘cause these niggas ain’t able
To put their self in your position, so it’s easier to play you
Run in your crib and rock your cradle, turn your ass into a sleeper
I’m drowin’ in these streets and can’t get no deeper

[Hook]
