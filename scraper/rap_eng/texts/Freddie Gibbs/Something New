Verse 1
Yeah, your girlfriend blow me while I blow the stanky
Then give me more head in the lab
She keep me motivated
Man I take my time when I write my raps
She growing so impatient
Rain skee hell snow
Backstage at the show
You know them hoes is waiting
On me and Jada B
One hit me gotta lay my peeps
I'm so straight on the boosie bitch
I'm straight slammin' to say the least
54 pounds of mid-grade
When I touch down at midway
Got the package in the morning
They was gone by the midday
I'm so pimp, bitch, I can't keep no bitches
Cuz brand new pussy the greatest thing the good Lord invented
Straight supped up super spoke
Candy coat, bitch you know I'm in it
Don't work no job
Cuz I live off dollars these hoes is spending
Straight Midwest pimpin'
My heart frigid as February
It's wrong but it's necessary
To fuck your valentine
Straight break her spine
And Indecipherable
Prices buried
No pussy
We push it
But never purchase it
Wanna put that ho to work
And show that ho whatcha working with

Chorus
I'm looking for some new hoes
More than one
I need a few hoes
I'm trynna kick it with some cool hoes
The type to flip it with the crew hoes
So I stay looking for some new hoes
Man fuck and ugly bitch
Some cute hoes
Cuz I ain't fucking with no boosie ass bitches
And groupie ass niggas
The playas I'm be round is straight pimpin'
And we're looking for some new hoes

Verse 2
Now let me tell you bout this one chick
That I had on my team
I called her princess
But she thought she was Queen
She liked to question the King
And made it hard to breath
Till that day I told that bitch "it's time to leave"
I'm a pimp
Now listen baby, I'm about my C.R.E.A.M
Rubber bands on the knots
And got big gats in the rings
Bitches thirsty cuz they see I'm doing well like the...
Wanting me to wipe them up
So they can step up their salary
Naw
I let her flatter me
But trick is a no-no
I take her to the crib
And let her hope on my pogo
Shawty let's take a ride
Take a look at the goalpost
Get outta line
I'll be enjoying it solo
I run a tight ship
Just don't fall off
I ain't playin, I get straight to the point
Just like John Wall
I take a blunt to the face
And then I turn up the bass
And tell them bitches I ain't never had a second to waste
