I said bitch I’m so for sure
Bitches ain’t shit, but niggas ain’t either
I said bitches ain’t shit, but niggas ain’t either

Yeah, before I check out, let me diamond my neck out
Scoop out the ones we be fucking and kick the rest out
We smoking out that audi s5, I’m audi 5, shaw
Quick to kick a bitch off a better still make a client down
Monkey ass ho, crooked as my last ho
Quick to suck a dick, but she can’t get no cash though
A player like me can’t settle for less when I done had more
That’s just go pro, rubber bands or glass hoes
Bitches ain’t shit, but them niggas ain’t either
It’s too short baby out my thoughts play speakers
Im rollin' with Alicia, she’s a real dick pleaser
And it masons have been…working these hoes up off my beeper
Gangsta gibbs

I ain’t trippin no, one night baby
Bitches ain’t shit, but them niggas ain’t either
I put this good dick in your life baby
Bitches ain’t shit, but them niggas ain’t either
And if we doing this alright baby
Bitches ain’t shit, but them niggas ain’t either
Cause I get chose, body slows
That make this pimping possible, possible
Yeah, anything is possible
Yeah, anything is possible, ah
Bitches ain’t shit, but them niggas ain’t either
Anything is possible, ah
Bitches ain’t shit, but them niggas ain’t either
Anything is possible

Don’t be worried bout when I’m going in
Or when I come back home
Just make sure that cucci lights stay one
I …took you from a hood to a home
Away from some tent with some bangs
To riding these with versace and gold
My bottom bitch she see the bigger picture
She treat her daddy like daddy I motivate her spirit
To get them strippers, you gonna make it in this cold world
Living and learn, there’s gonna be pimpin sellin product
Every corners you turn
Your mama warned you bout a nigga’s ways
She prolly told you baby save yourself and walk away
But you and I both know the reason why you chose to stay
Blessed to be with your faith, I’ve been hitting on the bitch all day
And he been…out

Anything is possible, ah
Bitches ain’t shit, but them niggas ain’t either

Heard that you believe in magic
Or just in lame ass niggas that go religious heavy
I bring a package and a bag of trees
But I need a person, an assistant help me with the shit
We got the lights up in the ground, you got the instruments
And how you figure is how I take it if you be into it
So let me break it down to you in the simple is
I need the dirt, you need the gold and bring the bindess in
Bring back the dividends
And we can cruise all night, work when I’m smokin
…no matter who I’m with, you a product I got a spot to spot to band
That will open sell it, you want it, then come and get it then
All my bindess clean, can’t track it back with no witnesses and girl
