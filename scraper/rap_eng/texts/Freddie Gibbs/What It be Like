[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
You can take it how you wanna take it homie
Yeah, you hear the record spinnin'
So you know I'm gettin' money
Got a spot, can't another nigga come and take it from me
Now you on the sideline, fucked up, lookin' funny
And I'm flossin' in the 68' oldsmo'
Attractin' hella booty, blowin' fruity with yo' hoes
You wanna be like me but you making that dough fold
I got some dealers that'll hit you up for that rose gold
I'm fresh up outta Indiana nigga
Gary to be exact
Got my ticket with this rappin' threw Gary up on my back
I'm in business with them nigga that keep a clip in the gat
D's on the lac
Catch you in the kitchen whippin the crack
Im a come up on some swishas and twist up anotha sack
Got your girl leavin wit her, she wonderin' where she at
What she said up in the Jag, if she let a nigga stab
But if not I put that bitch in the cab
I'll see ya later babe

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Verse 2
Say nigga what it be like
Wanna go to war with me you better get your G's right
I'm a bout to show 'em what these G.I. streets like
Broad day to midnight
Better keep your heat tight
2:11 1-8-7 semi-automatic weapon
Make a nigga get to steppin'
I don't care what set he reppin'
Bustin' in my own discretion
Bout to teach that ass a lesson
I be getting threatened by these lame brain niggas
But I never sweat 'em
Real niggas show me love in the hood
I ain't never got problems cause I got plugs in the hood
You might see me politickin' with them thugs in the hood
That's the type of shit I does in the hood
Middle-finger to you bitch ass niggas
Dog ass hoes
Y'all can keep on hatin' and Fakin, We gettin dough
The G's at my show
They rush the front row
Throw they sets in the air
Let a mothafucka know
