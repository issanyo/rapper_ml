[Verse 1]
Pushin' weight, nigga, I ain't pulled a muscle yet
Walkin' with the AR-15, dog don't need to muzzle that
Shrimp and lobster pasta, like a mobster, I may truffle that
Got a quarter milli in my trunk, I need to duffle that
Duffle that, where my duffle at?
In the sewer choppin' up them rats, where piranhas at
I stay in that Bentley or that Bach, nothing under that
Foreign bodies all in my garage, they LaFerrari that

[Chorus]
Wait, uh, pushin' weight, bitch, I'm pushing weight
Don't make me wait, uh

We servin' weight, uh
Pushin' weight, half a milli worth of weight, uh
She bad, I guess that pussy worth the wait

[Verse 2]
Pushin' weight, flippin' paper plates
In love with the paper, took my money on a date
She let me hit, I bring that pussy back to home base
My foreign bitches flew in town to Californicate
Wait, uh, psycho off of 17 Im Norman Bates
We gangbangin', all you neutral niggas can't relate
I turn that bando to a dope house, bitch, I renovate
I hit the party and whip that white girl to vanilla shake
Believe her, off the bitch, I take a nigga spot like Willie Beamen
Kitty kitty, fuck a Hellcat, I got the Demon
Used to smoke a stogie with Alexys in the Beamer
I miss my Miami hoe, she was a dick-pleaser

[Chorus]
Wait, uh, pushin' weight, bitch, I'm pushing weight
Don't make me wait, uh
Pushin' weight, bitch, I'm pushing weight
We servin' weight, uh
Pushin' weight, half a milli worth of weight, uh
She bad, I guess that pussy worth the wait, uh
Pushin' weight, bitch, I'm pushing weight
Don't make me wait, uh
Pushin' weight, bitch, I'm pushing weight
We servin' weight, uh
Pushin' weight, half a milli worth of weight, uh
She bad, I guess that pussy worth the wait

[Outro]
You no-good little bitch
Everyday of my motherfuckin' life

Nigga, what, baby
