[Hook x4: Freddie Gibbs]
I got pounds of keisha
Dope house full of geekers
Looking for that white bitch, cocaina have you seen her?

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I got pounds of keisha
Dope house full of geekers
Looking for that white bitch, cocaina have you seen her?
I got dope in my two-liter
Pimp C in my speaker
Cluckheads on my line, man I should take shit back to beepers
Just a young nigga 'bout my mail
Steady tryna work this yayo
Summertime, can't do jail
Money in the safe make bail
All these pussy ass niggas might tell
Pussy ass niggas might hate
Spoonfeed niggas, no way
Break it all down til its straight
I got beaucoup pounds of keisha
Dope house full of geekers
Heroin for your needle
All-white cocaina
I got that dope in my two-liter
Pimp C in my speaker
Cluckheads on my line, man I should take shit back to beepers

[Verse 2: Skrewface]
I got pounds of keisha
Keys of the coca
Voted number one D-Boy by the fiends and the smokers
Dope house full of cluckers and the feds trying to scope us
Still got to get that guap, man fuck the cops, I got that blow
Drank by the pint, what you sipping, nigga pour up
Drugs on deck, I'll never run out, what the fuck is a drought, nigga hold up
Anything you want I got more of
And I keep that thing cause ain't no love
I stay ready for the jack boys, how you want to act boy
Get your little bitch ass tore up
Anything you want I got more of
And I keep that thing cause ain't no love
I stay ready for the jack boys, how you want to act, boy
Get your little bitch ass tore up
I got a hundred rounds in my heater
Dope house full of geekers
And they lined up 'round the corner cause they know my price is cheaper
