Sexual faces, screaming and shaking
Had to beat it up, cause it was so amazing
Had to beat it up, cause it was so amazing
Had to beat it up, cause it was so amazing
Girl I know you can take it, I'm so impatient
Had me coming back, cause it was so amazing
Had me coming back, cause it was so amazing
Had me coming back, cause it was so amazing

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I got a day off
So it's off to the hotel we creep
We ain't even gotta talk, baby take it all off
I'mma hit it 24 straight, no sleep
And have you blowing up my phone for the whole week
And dipping off on your dude on the low key
Hey man I got her on Patron doing things she don't even do at home
Could've sworn that was your freak
And I'm so deep
And she's so wet
She telling me that she don't wanna let it go yet
So I'mma slow my stroke down and leave her broke down
When I'm in town, girl I'm on deck
And don't be slipping with her phone, cause he gon' check
You gotta know that if I don't call, then I'm gon' text
I have you running up them walls when I get up in them draws
You know that I can do it all, baby no sweat
I know you sick of these lame-ass niggas so thirsty
Wanna rush and get up in it on the first day
You need a man that make you want it in the worst way
And beat it up like every day is your birthday
You want to bail, I can tell by the look in your face
Straight to the valet, she ain't looking to wait
And when you got something cooking, I've been looking to taste
I got a hot tub at my place and baby we can make

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Man I got a girl so impatient
At the hotel posted up waiting
And her boyfriend took her on a trip
She was blowing up my phone for the whole vacation
Lame niggas and the hoes stay hating
Steady tricking your dough, you can't make it
Girl, I know you want to ball for the cause
Blow it all at the mall on a pimp, straight lace him
Polo'd down to my socks and boxers
Had a couple rounds of straight shots of vodka
Add juice with that, she getting loose in fact
And when she blew that back, it's hard not to watch her
Got her running like a Cadillac, I ain't gonna stop her
Loaded up and keep me bustin off like a chopper
Straight thug shit, so let a thug hit
I bet you never ever put nothing above this
Cause these lame ass niggas so thirsty
I got swag so I slam on the first date
I'm coming through cause you want it in the worst way
I'm about to beat it up like it was your birthday
You want to bail, I can tell by the look in your face
It would be a crime not to hit it, how you looking today
Cause when you got something cooking, I've been looking to taste
I got a loud pack at my place and baby we can make
