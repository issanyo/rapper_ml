[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Ugh, yeah nigga
Aight, this is a Freddie Gibbs public service announcement
Yeah, to all you rappers that are out there, straight up
Ugh, let's do it, aight
Yo if you say you won't-
Ugh, ugh, yeah nigga
Aight, this is a Freddie Gibbs public service announcement
Yeah, to all you rappers that are out there, straight up
Ugh, let's do it, aight

[Verse: Freddie Gibbs]
Yo if you say you won't lose I'mma prove you already lost
Don't try to play hard you niggas already soft
My flows is A1, spittin' nothin' but the best shit
All of my rhymes go hard like an erect dick
A lotta people say Freddie Gibbs commercial
Don' get it twisted, Freddie Gibbs'll hurt you
And if I;m popped I'll murk you
Like my liquor brown or white and my weed green or purple
I stay controversial, bring the heat in the booth
One take, I don't need rehearsal
I'mma spit my verse and I'm leavin'
I work hard to be the illest rapper out of the region
From the G to the H and D, to the harbor
Ain't a nigga that can fade me but my barber
So I don't really gotta tell you who I'm better than
This rap rookie be shockin' all of the veterans
If you talkin' shit you get silenced
Keep it to a minimum, don't start the violence
I'll hit ya whole team if you ever fuck wit' me
Ya boyz n the hood, they get killed like Ricky
You motherfuckin' loser
When it's time to ride y'all niggas punk out like Cuba Gooding Jr
So I know you afraid to get blazed
Niggas on my team got tecs and AKs
What you gon' do when shit hits the fan?
If the bullets miss you they gon' hit ya man
Like I told you before, if you scared go to church
I'mma be out on the block gettin' my merch
You thinkin' I ain't 'bout the money? Negro please
I'm on top of my chips like nacho cheese
So from now 'til I'm gon' don't ask me for shit
To get me on a song, gon' cost niggas a grip
I ain't talkin' 'bout niggas I'm cool wit'
I'm talkin' 'bout them other niggas I don't fool wit'
You prolly think I'm arrogant and actin' foul
But we wasn't cool then so we not cool now
I should start my own rap convention
Cause niggas like what I'm talkin' 'bout like tension
Roll wit' Freddie, you'll fuck a lotta hotties
Put me on ya album you'll sell a lotta copies nigga

[Outro]
Aye, aye, aye, check it out
Freddie I know you got some more shit to say
