[Verse 1: Freddie Gibs]
I wanted to be just like my big homie OJ
Instead of going to college four years I cooked the 4 way
King of the underground with no radio, pushing, no play
Still got plenty of smokers and geekers up in my doorway
Mama I'm gonna do it, dropping the [?] to it
Poison in my two litter, im posted with my two heaters
I know that my enemies pray I get smoked for this golden [?]
Father please forgive me I done left niggas no longer breathing
Broke, blind and crippled, tuned up in [?]
Nothing but murder on my mind but my bottom line's the issue
Girl don't hug and kiss you, saying you need some rehab
Serve the chronic, make me an addict
Guess I'ma be that nigga until my heart don't tick
Yeah, the Indiana Godfather, Eastside bitch
All is well when I bail, slang and bang 'til they tag my toe
I let my nuts drag down to the floor, gangsta Gibbs baby, uh
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Hook]
Everybody clap your hands, go, go, go
Everybody clap your hands, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 2: Chill Moody]
Uh, plans to be the greatest, I *hok to* spit in the faces of those they hold sacred, call them over rated
Haters looking at me sideways like I voted Reagen
Screaming "bro!" but there's no relation, your flow is basic
Grind and tired of waiting boosted up on that donorslist
Been over patients, now how sick is that
Mister Green on the track, I Jack the Rip for that
Philly on my shoulders like Iverson had the Sixers back
In them early double 0s, travel where trouble goes
Landed at O Jays, cautious of undercover foes
The backstabbers, they smile in your face
Cards revealed they yell "Sorry!", move you out of your space
It ain't a game though, well, at least that's how the saying go
Bottles to the face, pour a little for the slain though
On the road to the riches, tinted Durango
Won't park 'til the sun sets, no Drain-no, go

[Hook]
Everybody clap your hands, go, go, go
Everybody clap your hands, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 3: Apollo The Great]
Uh, I wanted to be just like my big cousin Chad
He took a few shoots, thought he was 2Pac but didn't rap
Showed me what it was to be in a trap
Start with nothing turn it into a step
Cooking crack, well feeling that
Looking back, yo I needed that
The reason that these youngings is cold red
Cause they ain't got official ohead
Mine was, conduct, my father figured dropping juice on me
I'm more advanced than a lot of niggas
Thoroughbred mentality, if men challange me Guaranteed that end violently, then silently
Talk to pigs, that's a no-no
Offical like the polo with the little logo
Do my dirt all by my dolo
Now yo yo, waddup yo?
Niggas is cutthroat, murder for anything but those scandalous slut hoes
The streets flood of the drug sold to the snub nose
Niggas fronting in the front, shots ringing when the club close

[Outro]
*I went through trials and tribulations, that's why I'm here, yeah. We all make mistakes, yeah and you do reap what you sow. So don't think you don't. You know I got involved with drugs and that's why I'm here. But this is not who I am, this is what I became*
