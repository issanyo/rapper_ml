Need you to sing for me
Need you to sing for me
Need you to sing for me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, pour up a four, twist up a sack
Detail the leather interior, wipe the vogues on the lac
These hoes, they come and go, but my bitch, come off them racks
So I push the pussy bottom to top, front to the back
Used to dance and work undercover
Your pockets right, get a room for the night and she might be your lover
Nigga pay your fee, you straight with me, how I conduct my business
Cuz I'm in this pimpin to win it
So efficient, but I think I just caught myself catching feelings

[Hook]
Cuz I
You know I love it when you sing for me
Uh, lord praise the paper you bring to me
Yeah, pushing powder, kush & codeine for me
Seen it in my dreams, you fiend for me
I think I love her

I... I'm bout to make that pussy sing for me
Yeah, lord praise the paper you bring to me
Uh, fried chicken and collard greens for me
Seen it in my dreams, you fiend for me
I think I love her

[Verse 2]
Yeah, another day we right back at it
Drinkin, smokin, poppin, sniffin, guess we got some nasty habits
But it don't affect my cash flow
Stack and watch my stash grow
And she trained in doe
Get on the floor and pop that ass ho
Nineteen without a dream, I intervene
Knock ya dick off in the dirt, the most bout it bitch on my team
In this triangle with love and drugs, it got me 'noyed
But I tried to brush it off when I heard she flirt with that boy

[Hook]
Cuz I
I... you know I love it when you sing for me
Uh, lord praise the paper you bring to me
Yeah, pushing powder, kush & codeine for me
Seen it in my dreams, you fiend for me
I think I love her

And I... I'm bout to make that pussy sing for me
Yeah, lord praise the paper you bring to me
Uh, fried chicken and collard greens for me
Seen it in my dreams, you fiend for me
I think I love her

[Verse 3]
I'm mixing pleasure with business, business with pleasure
And these police on my dick, she ain't trippin, she with whatever
Man we clockin mail up out that motel, let's get this cheddar
And despite the way she live, I can see us being together
So ashamed, afraid to tell my homies
Some nights I cry and I confide in her when I get lonely
Though we ain't livin holy jesus showed affection to mary, that's what the bible say
Can't picture life without you, I'd rather they take my life away

[Hook]
Cuz I
You know I love it when you sing for me
Uh, lord praise the paper you bring to me
Yeah, pushing powder, kush & codeine for me
Seen it in my dreams, you fiend for me
I think I love her

And I... I'm bout to make that pussy sing for me
Yeah, lord praise the paper you bring to me
Uh, fried chicken and collard greens for me
Seen it in my dreams, you fiend for me
I think I love her

[Verse 4]
Yeah, straight to the brain with it
Might take a bump or two, but now she in her veins with it
And I knew she fucked around, but I ain't know she had that itch
Til I walked in and I caught her sharing needles with a trick
Man, I used to cry and pray with this bitch
No doubt I turned her out, but I seem to lost my way with this bitch
My soul ain't worth the measly couple racks a day out this bitch
But I'm addicted to her love potion
Super potent, might end up overdosin'

[Hook]
Cuz I
I... you know I love it when you sing for me
Uh, lord praise the paper you bring to me
Yeah, pushing powder, kush & codeine for me
Seen it in my dreams, you fiend for me
I used to love her

I... you know I love it when you sing for me
Yeah, lord praise the paper you bring to me
I... hope you didn't pass your disease to me
Just a broken dream, a fiend to me
I used to love her
