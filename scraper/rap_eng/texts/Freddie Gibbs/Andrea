[Intro]
Yeah, rock solid nigga
Solid as a motherfuckin' rock, bitch
Yeah, nigga

[Verse]
When you fall, who you gon' land on?
Niggas foundation is shaky, ain't shit to stand on
A man's born with the only guarantee to live and die
But will I die before I live, 'fore I begin to fly?
Nigga, I can't deny when I'm not high, I miss that rush, that shit be callin' me
Demons never rest, I go to sleep, them bitches follow me
I just bought a AR for my dog, he walked the dog for me
Breakfast and promethazine with Ocean Spray and broccoli
Chase these hoes and I act like I can't keep these bitches off of me
They only fuckin' a nigga that got the most dollars in your squadary
I went to visit my nigga, he caught him a charge, his cards was fraudulent
Time to go get me some yayo, I know that Andrea gon' lease that car for me
That Bentley, Benz or Beamer, shippin' B's, I don't be in it
Not to let these bitches see me in it, fuck a ceilin'
Nigga wanna be me, even Steve could see the G in him
She work in the mornin', get that pussy in the PM then
I get in it then I jetted, it was a fly by, red bottoms, the thigh high
And every time she see me, she's sayin' "I don't know why I
Fuck with niggas like you 'cause at first, you would play the shy guy"
Give me that pussy once and I always got it like the Wi-Fi, bitch
I went to visit my nigga, he caught him a charge, his cards was fraudulent
Time to go get me some yayo, I know that Andrea gon' lease that car for me
I remember when Dukie lost his arm in fuckin' armed robbery
When I seen his shit was danglin', almost felt my heart stoppin' G
Stop it G, drop it G, so much weed, forgot to breathe
Some niggas take the trip I took, but they don't get to leave
Came out that bitch, I'm speakin' Russian, German, Guapanese
Can't let these niggas stunt my growth from livin' for my seed

[Chorus]
Level up, I'm on a stage, I gotta get paid
I can never be a slave for minimum wage
Cop an ounce up off the way, you fill 'em with K's
Level up, I'm on a stage, I gotta get paid
Level up, I'm on a stage, I gotta get paid
I can never be a slave for minimum wage
Cop an ounce up off the way, you fill 'em with K's
Level up, I'm on a stage, I gotta get paid

[Interlude: Big Time Watts]
Big Time baby
[Gimme a call back, bae bruh]
Big Time Watts motherfucker, fuck you
Punk motherfucker, who loves you, bitch ass nigga
Big Time

[Outro]
Shit, momma always told me "go and get your own shit"
Coke in front of me, nothin', so I got my own shit
Dope and coca√≠na powder, off in to the wrong shit
I been tryna fuck her for a month, but she ain't on shit
Start to make a nigga feel like I DM'd the wrong bitch
Skip the introduction, I just hit her with the long dick
Tried to drop the 50 pointer and I get my phone lit
Niggas looking for the, for the..... shit
Niggas always talkin' 'bout their bitches ain't shit
Caught a charge, my baby mama, she was solid as a brick
All the niggas I was feedin', they ain't give a nigga shit
Momma always told me "Nigga, go and get your own shit"
Toilet right next to my bed, I'm sleeping by my own shit
Dope and cocaina powder, off in to the wrong shit
I just dropped a 50 pointer and got my phone lit
Got my phone lit
