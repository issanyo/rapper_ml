Streets show no love
Same ones you call bro be the same ones plotting on the low
Streets show no love
Same bitch that you fuck be the same one that go set you up
Streets show no love
Better watch what you say, better yet, better watch where you stay
Streets show no love
Ride for your niggas but you ain't down to die for your niggas
Streets show no love

[Verse 1: AD]
Better pour some Henny for my niggas
Streets took away too many of my niggas
I ain't tryna be next, gimme a tec and a vest
A lot of hate on the West, a lot of shit I regret
Shaking hands with you fuck niggas that's plotting on my downfall
Should have seen me 'fore I got the fuck from round y'all
Keep the circle nice and small like it need to be
I never let a nigga straight Selena me
Ain't gon' have my daughter crying, I ain't tryna be on IG
Watching every move, they tried to get my nigga YG
These boys wanna take you away
When you just working hard, tryna make you a way
Fuck the opps and the judge too
Straight up, and fuck Donald Trump too
Bad enough the homies died from the One Time
We ain't tryna be no victim of no gun crime

[Hook: AD]
Streets show no love
Same ones you call bro be the same ones plotting on the low
Streets show no love
Same bitch that you fuck be the same one that go set you up
Streets show no love
Better watch what you say, better yet, better watch where you stay
Streets show no love
Ride for your niggas but you ain't down to die for your niggas
Streets show no love

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs ]
Gangster Gibb with the shit bitch
I'm on I-10 with a brick bitch
I'm a doggy, whip it up like biscuit
Should put my face on the package like Uncle Ben shit
Bow Wow, puppy chow
Black tie, Kool Moe Dee, how you like me now?
White china but it brown when I bust it down
Turn myself into the California plug
Yeah we niggas ship 100 pounds
6 in the morning, police at my bitch door
Margielas squeaking cause my bathroom sizzle
I hustle with my niggas since the Super Nintendo
I can't take a call from 'em cause them niggas will snitch though
When you feast where the killers eat
You could never show a nigga where your kids sleep
Bitches hit you where they keep a nigga baby, just to get a check up out you, wrap that dick up, I could never care about her

[Hook: AD]
Streets show no love
Same ones you call bro be the same ones plotting on the low
Streets show no love
Same bitch that you fuck be the same one that go set you up
Streets show no love
Better watch what you say, better yet, better watch where you stay
Streets show no love
Ride for your niggas but you ain't down to die for your niggas
Streets show no love

[Verse 3: Mozzy]
Damn, my niggas thug in these streets
Lost a couple of my brothers to these streets, they don't show no love
I promise not to show no fear
I'm out the window with the nana, long block on steer
Yeah, I swear it's been a hell of a year
Telling real niggas can't fuck with you squares
You can tell I'm in the field cause we comfortable there
My [?] on dope, that's why I'm [?]
Put blue cook in the air
Count blue sheets, making sure that it's there
Scared money don't make money, take a risk
I used to break in homes, now I break a bitch
Pops get moms down at 86
87, I was born to this gangster shit
Me and my day ones, we was taking trips
Back then was taking murder was the main shit

[Hook: AD]
Streets show no love
Same ones you call broke be the same ones plotting on the low
Streets show no love
Same bitch that you fuck be the same one that go set you up
Streets show no love
Better watch what you say, better yet, better watch where you step
Streets show no love
Ride for your niggas but you ain't down to die for your niggas
Streets show no love
