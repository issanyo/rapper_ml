[Verse]
Niggas talkin' bout work, nigga
Work
Niggas talkin' bout work
I just put your rap deal money in the trunk of my bitch whip
Re'd up on the first
Then she brought it back and when they put them Forgiatos on the Porche
Fuck shoes and a purse
Had so many mufuckas standing when she came through the valet
Should've came in a hearse (should've came in a hearse)
Homicide every time I ride
Hundred niggas on the block outside
Throw your hood, gangbang, set trip
Gold crown on the wrist keep a bitch mouth wide
Kushed out till a nigga O-D
The dogs scan for the O-P-P
I'm like Treach with a bitch
I just left with the bitch
I don't question a bitch
Cause she gon' say yeah

[Hook]
Say yeah (say yeah)
And my hoes don't tell me no, they say yeah (say yeah)
When you're paid how it's supposed to go they say yeah (say yeah)
A nigga really tryin' to ball tonight so say yeah (say yeah)
And I'mma let the money fall tonight  so say yeah (say yeah)

[Bridge]
Ridin' in my truck, bust a shot for my hitters (4x)

[Verse 2]
Type of nigga like to bone with the lights on
Dopehouse sold out till the white gone
Poppin' bud till the girls give me nice dome
Gettin' wet till the feds wanna ride out
Gon' put some lil niggas on time out
All the youngin's in my hood got a dope set
Niggas in the 9th grade got some nines now
Work (work), what you know bout work
Tell them niggas get that, then we ship that and we flip that
And we put it in a verse
Shout out to my Eastside hitters and my Westside hitters
Hittin' niggas where it hurts
I be in the Chi-Town fuckin' with some Southside bitches, gettin head in the vert

[Hook]
Say yeah (say yeah)
And my hoes don't tell me no, they say yeah (say yeah)
When you're paid how it's supposed to go they say yeah (say yeah)
A nigga really tryin' to ball tonight so say yeah (say yeah)
And I'mma let the money fall tonight  so say yeah (say yeah)

[Bridge]
Ridin' in my truck, bust a shot for my hitters (4x)
