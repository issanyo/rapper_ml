My, My, My
My paint dripping wet
Bass banging out the deck
Blaze chopping through your set
Breakin' necks

[Verse 1]
My Cutlass was on 20's then I moved up and I got them deuces
When I'm at the dealership I hit 'em with a few chips, now a nigga pulling off the lot with the new shit
Benz s550, sitting pretty, see me whipping that
Got dough so you know when I come up on the 650 I might get rid of that
I'mma pop that trunk on an old school dump, get beat up the street
Turn up that bump and blaze that blunt man motherfuck the police
They know I smoke, I drink, when I ride I stay high
I got my town on lock, niggas know that I'm that guy in G.I
That's why my, my, my paint dripping wet
Bumping Midwest shit in my deck
Better keep a clip in the tech and a vest on your chest, never know when a nigga might test
Ain't no slacking on my ends, I want big cream and nothing less
I ain't in the rap shit to make no friends, you want 16 then cut the check
Once I get it we gon' kick it, we gon' ball and make a lot of bread
Roll drop that beat that make 'em brawl, make 'em bobblehead
Hoes break they neck when I'm passing 'em by
Don't trip, your bitch wanna roll with a pimp, I'm so fly, she say my

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My Chevy on blades man, I'm clocking these hoes man
Lay that game on they brain, get my change with no shame
I was running these dames way before I could flow man
Easily separate me from the lames and no-names
It's Gibbs ho
Now you want it but you wasn't on it a year ago
Let a nigga hit that from the back, matter fact I'mma bring my friend ho
This shit right here ain't no lie
I deceive 'em and leave 'em wondering why
They say my, my jewels and chrome shoes got 'em breaking they neck
I don't feud with y'all dudes, I got pay to collect
I refuse to lose, lose, and will never accept
That's to the death, money, power, respect
This for them niggas out there rocking and chopping o's
Cocking and popping 4's
Straight pimping and macking hoes
In the back of the fat 'lac on 4's
They coming out they clothes when I'm passing 'em by
Don't trip, your bitch wanna roll with a pimp, I'm so fly, she say my

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My Chevy on 4's man, I'm clocking these hoes man
I got 'em breakin' they neck
My Caddy on 4's man, I'm clocking these hoes
I got 'em breakin' they neck
