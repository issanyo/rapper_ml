[Hook]
Fuck them niggas, I don't fuck with them niggas
Man, fuck them niggas I don't fuck with them niggas
Man, fuck them niggas I don't fuck with them niggas
Let a hollow point reach, I don't touch them niggas
Man, fuck them niggas I don't fuck with them niggas
Man, fuck them niggas I don't fuck with them niggas
Man, fuck them niggas I don't fuck with them niggas
Let a hollow point reach, I don't touch them niggas

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm the man, couple Benz and my Timberlands
Police on patrol and I'm serving like I don't give a damn
All this time they giving, I'm macking like I don't give a fuck
Bitch I get it get it [?] dope fiends can't get enough
Sleeping with my AK, man this shit so crazy
Niggas faking wanna hate cause everyday my payday
I got suckas around my way, say when they see me they gon spray me
Tell I post up at they crib, at they front door just like it's gravy
Man fuck them niggas, niggas bitch up and niggas bleed
Represent that G.I., every breath that a nigga breath
You a carbon-copy, everything that a nigga see
Pussy, [?] traitors, ain't never been in a nigga league

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Man fuck them niggas, I don't fuck with them niggas
And when they close the club I just might bust at them niggas
I just lay low get my pesos I ain't ducking them niggas
Bust that big shit you ain't [?], you was [?] them niggas
Servin sixty twos a four ways, nine pieces the halftime
Take them for the whole damn chicken, I gots to have mine
Grim Reaper, the street's whipper that keeps the streets hot
Knock the boy off his feet straight the fuck out of them Reeboks
Fuck them niggas I don't fuck with them niggas
I don't know them hoes, I don't fuck with them hoes
Gonna set them bitches out, watch a nigga get chose
We the gangsters in this bitch, sucka niggas get exposed

[Hook]
