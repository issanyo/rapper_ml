[Freddie Gibbs]
No doubt about it
I'm doing what I do dog

[Hook : Freddie Gibbs]
No doubt about it
Iâ€™m doing what I do dog
Keep more than a few broads moving with my crew dog
We bout it, bout it we came in with them tools dog
Doing what I do dog, moving with my crew dog

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Woop woop, yep yep
Snap back stay bang to the left
East side nigga bang to the death
Weak niggas we done laid them to rest
So pour out a little liquor
Got these hoes out and they vicious
Nigga tryin to bust them down
But I done fucked around and got an O of loud with no swishers
Whats up?
Roll some, smoke some, let me poke some
Man I got up in that pussy like four somethin'
When the clock struck five I was in the ride
Five thirty she was already on my line
Sayin what about breakfast, but a nigga like me too restless
Got a lot of money on my checklist
Talkin to my OG niggas in Texas he said
This game so dirty, gotta roll around with my thirty
And I keep my clip extended for these bitches I ain't worried
He said this game so dirty, gotta roll around with my thirty
And I keep my clip extended for these bitches I ain't worried

[Hook : Freddie Gibbs]
No doubt about it
I'm doing what I do dog
Keep on and a few broads moving with my crew dog
We bout it, bout it we came here with them tools dog
Doing what I do dog, moving with my crew dog

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
No doubt about it, no doubt about it
Keep hoes around me don't fuck with them hoes that doubt me
My nigga's bout it, and my bitch's bout it
And my dick too crowded got too many people on it
Now if people talking bout you then know you're doing things
They ask about my song, they like the way I screw it man
Hey, these bitches boppin, man these nigga coppin
Man I feel like every label in the world just signed me
Yeah I'm from the bottom, when we sip drink and we poppin pills
We pop the seal, got diamond grills
And I'll fuck your girl while I'm bending curves
One think about it, say one think about it
I'm always about it only touch it for a profit yeah

[Hook : Freddie Gibbs]
No doubt about it
I'm doing what I do dog
Keen on and a few broads moving with my crew dog
We bout it, bout it we came here with them tools dog
Doing what I do dog, moving with my crew dog

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Woop woop, yep yep
This for my niggas on them project steps
This for my niggas on the project stoop
Grind till you got a coupe no roof
Grind till you put your moms in a new spot
On the block with the bomb it was too hot
On the block with the bomb it was so cold
Sellin dope in the snow til my toes froze
Deliver 36 o's in the old's mo
One stop, nigga ran through the whole dough
One stop, nigga ran through the whole brick
Ice water wheel now that's cold shit
When it's hot keep it cold bitch
Straight put some work on that road bitch
Can't leave the street life alone mayne
Know Jeezy callin my phone mayne

This game so dirty, gotta roll around with my thirty
Can I keep my clip extended for these bitches I ain't worried
He said this game so dirty, gotta roll around with my thirty
And I keep my clip extended for these bitches I ain't worried

[Hook : Freddie Gibbs]
No doubt about it
I'm doing what I do dog
Keen on and a few broads moving with my crew dog
We bout it, bout it we came here with them tools dog
Doing what I do dog, moving with my crew dog
