[Intro]
Yeah, fo'sho, uhh
Fuck the competition, nigga, yeah

[Verse 1]
Uhh, fuck niggas, spark the weed up
Shit been watered down, the rap game they need us
Real niggas to intervene, they interject
Got a bitch naked, got some neck in the Vette and I'm finna jet
Finna get fucked up in this bitch, thatâ€™s on fin
Popping yoppers, fuck the coppers, sell narcotics, nigga we bring that on in
Bitch I'm a problem, got your columns full of losses, no wins
Gary gangsta, fuck with Chicago niggas out that Low End
Much love to my nigga Mikey, threw muzzles off in they mouth
Nigga hitting licks where we reside for unspecified amounts
Stuff the mattress full of merch, .40 calibers in the couch
Guess I'm on the high seat, rob me, you won't make it out
I can make her shout but my attitude might just make her pout
Find me charming 'til she really found out what I was about
My recreation, occupation, invading a nigga house
Smokin' and ridin', I ain't high when I'm drivin'? I highly doubt it
And I don't believe these rap niggas
You can front for your fans but I know it's an act, nigga
Judge a man by his character and not by his wealth
A real G, I never kissed niggas or shot myself
Gangsta Gibbs

[Hook]
I'm number one, number one with a bullet
Bring your guns, fifty shots when I pull it
Make 'em run, make you motherfuckers bleed
Only fuck with real G's, public enemies
I'm number one, number one with a bullet
Bring your guns, fifty shots when I pull it
Make 'em run, make you motherfuckers bleed
Only fuck with real G's, public enemies

[Verse 2]
Probably be murdered for some shit that I said
I'd be a legend out this motherfucker breathing or dead
But y'all don't hear me, these uppity bitches they all fear me
Fuck a diamond on your finger, I guess it's the dog in me
Ain't no hog in me, I'm swine-free, tough as the Iron Sheik
Nine G's for the nine piece, how you define me?
A student of the thug nigga, drug dealer college
Majored in robbing and graduated with honors
Seeing clearly through these Dolce Gabbana's and marijuana fog
Niggas trying to vulture the culture, motherfuck all of y'all
Dickblowers, rapper reality shows, y'all just attention whores
Don't give a fuck if I set a record or win awards
I'm just blessed to be out here living life
Giving these niggas hell, so reckless with everything I write
Shit got me wishing DMX had never hit the pipe
Pun ain't never died and Big L was still here to bless the mic

[Hook]
I'm number one, number one with a bullet
Bring your guns, fifty shots when I pull it
Make 'em run, make you motherfuckers bleed
Only fuck with real G's, public enemies
I'm number one, number one with a bullet
Bring your guns, fifty shots when I pull it
Make 'em run, make you motherfuckers bleed
Only fuck with real G's, public enemies
