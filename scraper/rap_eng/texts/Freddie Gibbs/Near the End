Well there's a right time and a right place
Mexico City and a steel briefcase
Filled with the soul
Of a young man
And there's a holy ghost on the other side
Looking for a bed to close his eyes
While he gets away
From the routine
We on the go
Route 66
Convertible and a bunch of chicks
I can't complain
Life's been good to me
Scotch on the rocks
And pacific coasts
Block the wind
And Light the roach
We outta here
I'm signing off
(Don't you close your eyes you'll miss all the fun)
We're Almost Near The End
Well there's a right time and a right place
2 technics in a metal case
And a bb gun
Don't shoot your eye
And Kerouac is in the back
Fill the shelf
And clean the rack
It's apropos, what up bro
We on the go
95
Rocking till the wheels fall off the side
Ain't no rims to spin
To my chagrin
Insomnia
A pack of blues
Coltrane speakers
And converse shoes
Lace em up, we on the run
