[Verse 1]
Dear Maria, I know it was like 2010 the last time I had seen ya
Back when I used to hang outside, Actavis in my two liter
40 Cali, [?] pimpin', gotta keep the 9 mm
Plus I, plus I traded in the black Cadillac for the Beamer
I was trappin' out a dirty apartment on Little Caesar's
Damn Maria, can I purchase a brick of yay from your people?
Homie front me with like five, paid twenty-three for the eagle
Boy, I live illegal

[Bridge]
See the game, it gon' never change
See the game, got me everythin'
See the game, it gon' never change
Cocaine, Mary Jane, got me everythin', yeah

[Verse 2]
Dear Maria, you always kept a young nigga fed when I wasn't eatin'
Like when you set me up for the lick on them Puerto Ricans
Always said that if I get rich off this shit that you'd be the reason
Always said that if I'm gon' jump out this shit that you'd be the reason
Gotta have a type of all type of bitches, I gotta feed them
On the late night, with the dick game, drugs in me got me creepin'
I know you love me, yeah, know you can't picture a nigga leavin', I ain't never leavin'
Never, no never never say never, nigga
Say motherfuck love and stay on your cheddar, nigga
I wish that it felt like I had forever with you
But I know that one day your gon' find a better nigga
They gon' wife you up, settle you down, they gon' have a weddin' with ya
I'm just a thug, I'll buy bottles and get a section with ya
Maria flip if she found out I'm fuckin' on her sister
Freddie Kane, Dog unchained, I'm just that kinda nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
Got the game runnin' in my veins
I got the game runnin' in my veins
Blood on my opponent, don't give a fuck, I flaunt it
All I ever wanted was everythin'

[Chorus]
Livin' in the city where you're shittin' on the city and the city got me blast
I got chickens in the city and a cousin shippin' with me
Told her ain't no future with me, I'm addicted to this cash
Dear Maria

[Bridge]
See the game, it gon' never change
See the game, got me everythin'
See the game, it gon' never change
Cocaine, Mary Jane, got me everythin'

[Outro]
Never change, oh yeah
Never change, yeah yeah
Cocaine got me everythin'
This shit it won't change shit
Mary Jane, Rick James, Cocaine
Ooh, ooh yeah
Rick James, Rick James
Cocaine, Rick James
