[Verse 1: ANTHM]
See my heaven, see my hell
Blurried eyes as my teardrops fell
No sleep, on my feet I dwell
Down to the ground on the street I knelt
And a rose, grew from the concrete crack
Nigga please, would you rewind me back
This reminds me that
Despite the bullshit you'll never find me trapped
Let the demons now go loose
Cause a nigga done found his roots
Crush the head of a serpent
Quick to turn that motherfucker right into cowboy boots
Sunshine or rain, yin or yang, Russian roulette
Time to aim. Four for joy, five for pain
Nine bullets. I pull it to survive the game

[Hook: ANTHM] [x2]
That joy, that pain, you trying hard to maintain
Got problems all in your brain
And it feels like it won't change

That joy, that pain, that sunshine and that rain
That happiness that you gain when you know it's getting better now

[Bridge]
Real late in the midnight hour, we look for therapy
What if that sun don't rise? There ain't no guarantee
Real late in the midnight hour, we look for therapy
But I know I'll be at peace when they bury me

But I know I'll be at peace when they bury me [x4]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Late night in the midnight hour
I walk in the shadow of death
All about money and power
Smoke some 'til there ain't nothing left
Smoke some 'til I cloud out my brain
Smoke some 'til I smoke out the pain
And I wanna go in for this
But these incidents got me going insane
Dear lord, this can't be livin'
That day mama birthed me
I know this ain't what she envisioned
That I'd ride custom cuts and Chevy's with chrome all in my engine
Too nervous to doll the surface, I'm losin' my religion
Gangster gibbs baby

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: ANTHM]
Have you seen my doubts and fears?
Have you seen my smiles and tears?
Trying to live my life, wouldn't be the same fight
If I lived for a thousand years, thousand years
But we're born, and we die, and we mourn, and we cry
'Til one day, we say goodbye

[Verse 3: ANTHM]
I was set to perform, in a world so cold, never expected it warm
I rejected the norms, swaggar jacking Jesus when I slept in a storm
But I woke up to the sunshine, had peace like a Buddhist
Surrounded by 12 people, each one was a Judas
But the truth is that I had to go through this
No person here, gotta roll dolo when I persevere
Damn, oh Fortuna please have mercy dear
No I ain't giving up that quick, fuck that shit
Feel my heart in that stuff I spit
Once I get my peace of mind I'm about to build my throne right above that shit

[Hook] [x2]

[Bridge 2] [x2]

That joy, that pain [x2]
That joy, that pain, that sunshine and that rain
That happiness that you gain when you know it's getting better now

[ANTHM]
I feel that joy and pain, through what I overcame
You're always in my life, that's how I know your name
And when I feel that pain, that joy is Novocaine
You got me feeling right, through what I overcame

I feel that joy and pain, through what I overcame
I feel that joy and pain, through what I overcame
