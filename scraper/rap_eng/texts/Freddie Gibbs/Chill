[Hook][Freddie Gibbs]:
Cause I just want to chill
So if you with it, baby we can chill
Do something explicit and then fit in my Deville
Chill
Know that you've been waiting for me all night
I'm on the phone seeing if it's alright, if I can come and
Chill
You know I'm always down to kick it girl
So just hit me up when he's tripping girl
Chill
Cause you know I would do you proper though
And baby I stay posted, I ain't got to go
Cause I just want to
Chill

[Verse One] [Phonte]
Chill
The rap game will never let me
So when I'm home, You know I'm indirectly
Laying low and staying out of the flashing lights like I got epilepsy
We live the life of Riley, I'm Teddy, she's Cheryl Pepsi
Soon as your girl met me
She looking thorough sexy, saying "Tay, I love the way you hold a mic."
Pimp side saying, "Tigga, you the next Dolemite."
Simp side saying, "Nigga chill, she the prototype."
Prototypical response, "Where we finna go tonight?"
"I don't like to kiss and tell. Would you like some Zinfandel?"
"Sho' yo' right."
"Maybe that'll hit your spot. Excuse me baby, I forgot
Bourgeois girls drink Riesling now, sorry for the oversight
I don't mean to brag, you know you're fucking with a soldier right?
Pretty thing in law school. Once you pass the bar, oooh
I put you on retainer like an overbite
Girl, the show is over let me be your encore tonight
Cause I just want to chill."
