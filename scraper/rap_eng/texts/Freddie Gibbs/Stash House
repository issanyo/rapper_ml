[Intro]
Dollar, dollar bill in the stash house tryna hide another mil
Dollar, dollar bill, yeah

[Verse 1]
When I got out the car I was talking on the phone
Calm in the storm
The Rolls Royce Wraith and a Rolls Royce Dawn
Too slick, you probably slip before you can step up on
Intercepted before you could creep, you see you been crept on
Lifers press on
Adding to my Rolex collection
Sky-dweller rose gold probably do my next one
I know what you wanna hear
That shit that make you hustle all year
I came to the studio with a boat
So I can load these keys up, when they're ready to go
Them other crews slangin' stepped on dope
You want that pure shit, homie then you know where to score
The game done changed y'all, but not your dawg
I'm still in the cut, rolled up in the kush fog

[Hook]
Like dollar, dollar bill in the stash house tryna hide another mil
Yeah, dollar, dollar bill in the stash house tryna hide another mil
Yeah, dollar, dollar bill in the stash house tryna hide another, hide another mil
Yeah, dollar, dollar bill in the stash house tryna hide another mil
Yeah, dollar, dollar bill

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Kane, nigga
Yeah, rest in peace my nigga Timbuck
Used to hit the beauty bar on Tuesday foreign rimmed up
Freddie Forgiato, chop that flex to get my chips up
When I jumped up off the porch, ain't had no clue just where I end up
Audio stay dope like ice cubes and boiling water
Ain't no gas up in this bitch but I'm cooking like Snoop and Martha
Fuck the stripper club if they ain't got titties out like the Carter
Young Nino if she nasty like Janet, I James DeBarge her
Like dollar, dollar bill
Poured the whole Joe Montana when I broke the seal
Niggas thought that I was dead in the gutter they wrote the will
Beat the case and I put new candy paint on my Coupe de Ville
Beat the case and put my baby on acres like ain't shit changed up
Yeah I rap but bitch my meat and potatoes come off that slangin'
Took the jar up out the box whipped it, shake it, let it dry, then break it
Get you three for two I serve triple-doubles
Anthony Davis or Russell I meant
More than a couple assists once I alley-oop the ball
Player was running the bitch
Gangster Gibbs flipping a chick like I was Chris in 1996
She getting dick from a player off the New York Knicks
And I'm like Ewww
Dollar dollar bill
