[Intro]
Some of the Crips and the Bloods, two of LA counties most vicious gangs
LA police are getting their orders as they prepare for another assault on street gangs
Let me just ask you this
Yah. What is that? OG On The Blade, you know what I mean Yah
Often times a Nigga had to trip on Bloods and Crips Bgs, Yah League of Starz Yah, Yah, Yah

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Gary nigga, blowin' doja, switched it over, West coast
Used to meet my dope plug on 65th, Figueroa
Nigga was an old school IVC, Fred come flip these pies with me
Livin' that California dream, deliverin' dope in that limousine
And a nigga was like my pops out here
Put me on when I dropped out here
"Back home I know you Vice Lord but them red cars'll get you popped out here"
I had an all burgundy Monte Carlo SS with the T tops out here
A lot of fuck boys stay hatin' that, but these LA hoes on my jock out here
Got a plug bitch fresh out of Inglewood, smoke real good
Lit my doobie, gettin' Jamaican food
I'm off Crenshaw but don't trip though 'cause he a 6-0
And I can still move through St. Andrews
With Eight Tray's like it ain't shit though
I know Hoover niggas, I mean Groover niggas that have been down for that kick-door
I ain't fuck 'round since I touched down on that westcoast with this shit
Knowin' a lot out of towners claim sets, I'd had seen death over for this shit
You might live today and get ate tomorrow, like leftovers and shit
Bitch, often times a nigga had to trip on Bloods and Crips

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Color of my dollars stay proper, that's what I claim, bitch
Mobbin' in my old school Impala, candy the frame, shit
Niggas on that, "Yo, where you from?" and, "Yo, what you bang?" shit
Often times a nigga had to trip on Bloods and Crips
Color of my dollars stay proper, that's what I claim, bitch
Mobbin' in my old school Impala, candy the frame, shit
Thugs, gang-bangers, and drug slangers I hang with
Often times a nigga took a trip with Bloods and Crips

[Verse 2: G Perico]
You must don't know no better, boy, this shit is so aggressive
Gang bangers pop out, that's how we send a message
Get up close and then you stretch from doin' all that flexin'
One down, now we lookin' for the next one
Boy, I'm ballin' and bangin' from Monte Carlos to Rangers
In your set, bang a bitch with a car full of gangsters
It's active out here, it ain't just the summer
This shit be crackin' all year, boy
And it be Blood on Blood, Crip on Crip
Fuckin' with a nigga that's cut'll get you chipped
Them politics real from the streets to the pen
Sex, money, violence, that's what make my world spin
If I gotta trip on anybody, for any problems
We gonna get anybody and keep gettin' dollars
So, tell me do you bang, nigga? What set you claim, nigga?
It's all the same once that 9 go bang

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Color of my dollars stay proper, that's what I claim, bitch
Mobbin' in my old school Impala, candy the frame, shit
Niggas on that, "Yo, where you from?" and, "Yo, what you bang?" shit
Often times a nigga had to trip on Bloods and Crips
Color of my dollars stay proper, that's what I claim, bitch
Mobbin' in my old school Impala, candy the frame, shit
Thugs, gang-bangers, and drug slangers I hang with
Often times a nigga took a trip with Bloods and Crips

[Verse 3: Mozzy]
Four Finger bangin', these niggas know I'm a gangster, ma
Them cap guns prepare me for phonkin', I like to thank you, ma
Your baby boy a felon, these niggas been tryna spank me, ma
Gotta catch a body, that's how you climb up the rankings, ma
Red rag, flame game, head-shot'll paint the pavement
Gang related state-of-mind, I refuse to make a statement
You ain't hangin', you ain't bangin', killers in my affidavit
Tattoos on all they faces, résumé consist of yankin'
They cuttin' from a different blanket, different quilt, different cloth
On the B, I got some kiways I could call to pick you off
Free my brother from the clanker, keep your nigga lit, it's law
We got different point of views because of all the gangster shit I saw

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Color of my dollars stay proper, that's what I claim, bitch
Mobbin' in my old school Impala, candy the frame, shit
Niggas on that, "Yo, where you from?" and, "Yo, what you bang?" shit
Often times a nigga had to trip on Bloods and Crips
Color of my dollars stay proper, that's what I claim, bitch
Mobbin' in my old school Impala, candy the frame, shit
Thugs, gang-bangers, and drug slangers I hang with
Often times a nigga took a trip with Bloods and Crips

[Outro: Interview]
I'm down for it because I'm a true nigga, a true nigga. I come from the heart
Why? Why be in a gang? What's in it for you?
What's in it?
I mean you get killed right?
Yah
You mean some of your friends been killed?
Yah. simple cause
What's this simple cause?
Being a nigga. Going down with the niggas. That's how we feel
We die, it's like we go kill one of them. -- till one of them die, because they down for it, they had get took out. They come back and then its a feud till they don't want no more. Til everybody just drop it, but ain't nobody gonna drop it
