I Woke up this morning with murder on my mind
My nigga boutta hit me with another throw away burner around 9
So I get up get back on my shit
Working off a pack never had no brick
17 homeboys up in the clip
Before I beg like a bitch Im a hit me a lick
On everythang
Lay you on that stretcher man
Bust that thang or rest in flames when you disrespect the game
Can't do that don't sell cocaine
Cock that four fifth back and aim
Do my dirt all by my self
No witnesses to say my name
Im fresh up out a city where most niggas broke
60% unemployment... why you think we sellin dope?
Lil kids walk around with that issue pistols you gotta tote
Don't get caught sleepin these G.I. streets'll leave you comatose

I got my gun you got your gun but will you bust your burner
Niggas pack heat but they don't really want that murder murder
I got my gun you got your gun but will you bust your burner
Niggas pack heat but they don't really want that murder murder

Aye bitch fuck with me whats up
Im...not gonna let bitch niggas knock me off my grind
Off my Grind
Woke up this morning with murder on my mind
Nigga Im knee deep in this beefin
Out here creepin and squeezin
Give a nigga one reason Ill leave niggas leakin
Aye bitch fuck with me whats up
Im...not gonna let bitch niggas knock me off my grind
Off my grind
Woke up this morning with murder on my mind
Nigga Im knee deep in this beefin
Out here creepin and squeezin
Give a nigga one reason Ill leave niggas leakin
Aye bitch fuck with me whats up

How many niggas can remember the
First time you had to ride out on your enemy
Ski mask over my skull to cover my identity
Im a make these niggas bleed and vacate the vicinity
Bustin off that chopper my knocka
Never been no thang to me
You can add me up Im straight 100 and its plain to see
Lets talk with heaters you can miss me with that fakery
These niggas really ain't the killers that they claim to be
Chillin on a back street loadin up the black piece
Bout to go and hit em with his execution
And dont get caught up in the middle
Cause the bullets gonna riddle
You can forget about a resolution
Ill send a nigga to his maker
Get away with the paper
And disapear into the night like a ghost
One false move and thats all she wrote
100 thousand niggas in this city
Over half them of them mutha fuckas probably comin at my throat

I pack my toast bust I my burner
Niggas pack heat but they dont really want that murder murder
Bitch one more time I said
I pack my toast I bust my burner
Niggas pack heat but they dont really want that murder murder

Hey bitch fuck with me whats up
Im...not gonna let bitch niggas knock me off my grind
Off my Grind
Woke up this morning with murder on my mind
Nigga Im knee deep in this beefin
Out here creepin and squeezin
Give a nigga one reason Ill leave niggas leakin
Aye bitch fuck with me whats up
Im...not gonna let bitch niggas knock me off my grind
Off my grind
Woke up this morning with murder on my mind
Nigga Im knee deep in this beefin
Out here creepin and squeezin
Give a nigga one reason Ill leave niggas leakin
Aye bitch fuck with me whats up
