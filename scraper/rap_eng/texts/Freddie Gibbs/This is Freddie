I got the court room smelling like kush and Swisher Sweets
My second gun charge, second arrest within a week
With every second that race by, remain high, chasing cigar smoke
Toking that trainwreck in my Training Day Monte Carlo
Not supposed to carry but choppers I keep a carload
Four-five, crush white up, wannabe Marlos
My kind rush fine dust running from narcos
Labels tripping cause record stores ain't scanning barcodes
Crackers gonna conceal the facts
Why every rapper that I meet keep telling me he bringing this real shit back?
When the real shit is right in my notepad
And for me to relinquish secrets of the beats I gotta be toe-tagged
Yo' cash better than no cash
Already had the coke bagged up and your dope stashed
He saved me half the work, I made it twerk, I was so glad
To let 'em out the door for 6 a O so they go fast
I'm from the home of the old-fashioned, Joe Jackson ass whoopin'
Niggas broke off in their own factions crack cookin'
I got the recipe, plenty of proof in that puddin'
More than making stains, breaking dames, and 'Lac pushin'
I ship the stanky shit to you next day
I'm the shit, fresh outta Shitsville, USA
Where shit happens
And it just so happened I mastered this
Bash me for rapping, I could be out here blasting shit
Gibbs

Nigga, no rap boy can test me
Crush 'em like Curtis did Jeffery
I bet them that boy respect me
Coming off wrong, coming correctly
This is Freddie
On ThisIs50
Fuck wit' me
