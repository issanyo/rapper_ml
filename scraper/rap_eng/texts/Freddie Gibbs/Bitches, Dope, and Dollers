[Intro:]
Do you wanna ride?
I can’t hear ya? I said do you wanna ride?

[Chorus 1:][x2]
When I take that final sleep
I pray my maker carry me
Take my fame and pull it free
Bitch nigga to bury me
Was a bigger man
But they make me out of cavity
Product of my hood
Imma naturally do it for them

[Verse 1:]
Bitches, dope and dollaz
Rag top dropping bottles
Strap on the lap we mobbin’
Anything move we robbin
Try me
I be ready for the doorway
Third degree
Some how doa silence me
Cadillac inside burgundy
Swerving to the beats like surgery
Everytime I hear the streets
My ears be listening while the talking
Scheming, plotting, scoping
Wonder what I roll in, who I roll with
When I’m riding out
Fully having niggas start hiding out
Till the block hit
Too hot to cool off
But in my mind I’m a young grinding soldier
Frontlining in my motherfucking shoes off
My birthplace’s the worst place
In Texas my first case
I’m paranoid and I’m fully [?]
And I’m saying thanks to my hittas say
Hurry up nigga no time to waste
Ski mask on my face
Call them hoes hanging at barrio
And tell em let’s go get this cake
All my life I ain’t had shit
Man, full of bad shit
Once upon a time I was a child
Now I’m a savage
Society live and sue a nigga state with the 2-2-3
Do it for the block
Do it for the hood
Do it for the city
I do it so fucking G, nigga

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2:]
Bitches, dope and dollaz [x8]

[Verse 2:]
East Side G.I
Ain’t got a damn thing to do but get high
And I keep that famous steel on my lap
I gotta ride for the kill
Gotta get by
Gotta roll for dope
Gotta maintain
Get to the West Coast nigga same thing
Nigga gotta be down
Ride or die
Bout it bout it man
I do it for the
Dollars and dope
Bitches, Benzes and Bimmers
Dese 90 containers of cocaine
Sipping [?] by the liters
That nigga who you believe in
We black and underachieving
Told momma I need some money
She said I’m in need of Jesus
Know what
These streets so dough up
Got a pump in the trunk with a roll up
Gotta dough but I gotta get more up
Hold some nigga down for a hold up
What’s up
What’s up with the ski mask
Motherfucker don’t shit where you sleep at
Get the dope and the money but you keep that
For the one nigga you don’t wanna see that
These niggas got me so trigga happy
And I’m so caught up in this game
And i can’t do shit about it
And these niggas betta know before I go
Imma get what I get up out it
Fuck nigga I dunno what you bout
But bitch I been about it
I’m bout them bitches, dope and dollaz

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
