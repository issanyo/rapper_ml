[1st Verse - Noelz Vedere]
What's good mufucka I'm back
And I'm ready to attack, with plenty of them adverbs
Rep it on the map, North side got me winning like a champ
Need confetti from the rafters
With a couple banners up in the wall
Put percussion patterns in figure fours
I could run it backwards achilles torn, and still get farther than you
Son 'em all I'll be fathering you
And y'all dudes ain't sicker than the bro
On a mission for the figures and the dough
Gripping ice twice thicker than the snow
White liquor to the dome, got me faded, flagrant
Thoughts with my dogs might kick it through your door
Like knock knock, give me everything you got got
Then we get to rolling never going for the (police sirens)
Stop, go, ride slow, I'm like Apollo you could copy that, CC
Fee fee's yeah we need
Comma's in larger size, this drama ain't dramatized
My minds been lobotomized modified for a kamikaz
Confident you ain't topping I, stop it 5
You ain't committing no homicides
All kind of guys tryna copy my copyrights
They know I'm working with ether
This how to kill a mocking bird, I'm mocking birds with tequila
Drink up drink up (she thirsty), steady swerving the beamer
My family savages they will taxiderm you and beat you
'Till you got no working features
But I'm chilling, riding heavy with my canines
Leaning out the window bopping steady to the baseline
Your main dime give facetime to the realest on the lake side
You getting pressed, we getting ghost, we out of focus

[Hook]
Got a cup full of drank like fuck what you think
Staying out of focus
Now we headed to the spot with a car full of thots
Staying out of focus
And I ain't never scared of none of y'all
Staying out of focus
We staying out of focus, focus
Staying out of focus

[2nd Verse - Noelz Vedere]
Yo Chi-town we got a mufuckin' problem
Mathematical stamina so you haters can't solve 'em
The rumors is true, some labels called him
But the decimals mentioned was cold, its finna be a hot autumn
The flow ill from the pop
They like when he for real gonna drop down, but hater we still at the top
Fuck a drill, fuck a opp, got dudes in the field with them blocks
No chill, we hit a mill then we stop
My attitudes latitude breaking the ruler
Got wild boys catching cases for fuel
And I don't know if they facing medusa or Jacob the jeweler
Cause either way they stoned face when they breaking the shooter in
Going for the win, victory lap
I force literature, Forest Whitaker is he could rap
I'll mortician ya', core minimum simply is that
And if you dissing it get thicker than rap
Hold up let me pause it, these bars are meditation
Tryna focus on the nation, I'm a walking animation
I'm an author for this younger generation like Shel Silverstein
But my dream includes hell with a beam
All we do is win, this our dream
Give me a pick up team, I'll still pick up rings
Put dead rappers in my pick up thing
Fuck that, we don't drive we too fly to keep up you better pick up rings
I ain't even start to pick up steam yet
Got these veterans warming the bench, T-Mac
Got these legends taking tips from re-caps
Of how we winning no limit, tell them where we at
Chi-town (chi-town) this the murder cap (yeah)
Wear your hat the wrong way turn to a murder cap (yeah)
Take them stripes off your chest, you gonna earn it back?
We out of focus, vision out, blurring that

[Hook]
Got a cup full of drank like fuck what you think
Staying out of focus
Now we headed to the spot with a car full of thots
Staying out of focus
And I ain't never scared of none of y'all
Staying out of focus
We staying out of focus, focus
Staying out of focus

[3rd Verse - Freddie Gibbs]
Said I know you wanna smoke my nigga
Why don't you go 'head roll that dope my nigga
When I'm at that stove man I work that yayo
I got 36 O's man I'm on my J-O
We sell dope in the daylight, rob mufuckas in the night time
85th floor of the condo
I hit it from the back  while she looking at the skyline
They call me young Freddie Kane I'm the coldest dog
East to the West niggas know me dog
Known to leave the club with atleast two hoes
You could tell I'm about to hit both of y'all, and thats real
Thats real, thought I told y'all niggas I was on my J-O
Ski mask on my face nigga drop that yayo
Know the Eastside niggas gotta get that mayo
Got a hundred five pounds got it from Vallejo
Stay down and stay focused, some homies tried to play bogus
When the people hit me with the probation fuck that P-O I stay smoking
When I hit the club you know it's titty season all the bitches bust it straight open
And when I hit the club you know it's titty season all the bitches bust it straight open
Nigga young Gibbs
