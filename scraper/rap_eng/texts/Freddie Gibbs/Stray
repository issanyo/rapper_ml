(Freddie Gibbs)
Fa-fa-For sure
It's Gibbs Baby
Fa-fa-for sure
For sure, yeah, yeah

(Verse 1)

Excuse me miss my name is Frederick
So check it, no disrespectin'
For the record i'mma say can't do shit but picture you naked
Picture you under covers, undressin', suckin' and sexin'
Bent over on balconies, you throw that ass i'mma catch it
Stretch it, strip it and stroke it
Hopin' to keep you open
Be like Magic, straight ho magnet
I call it that hocus pocus
And hoes notice, I ain't no fuckin' hero
I'm fresh up out G.I. right next to the Chi where the niggas cold pimps
Shouts outs to Belo Zero
That shit y'all speak kept a young nigga up on his grind
Now i don't trip on stupid bitches I make love to their mind
And that's fine, I told my nigga put 'em back in the pimp game
Everything I slang came straight outta bitch mane
Nigga, I can't stand

(Devin The Dude)
(Hook x2)
I can't stand (I can't stand) stupid bitches
I keep away, they ain't ridin (my bone)
Have no plans (no plans) with stupid bitches
I tend to stray from stupid bitches

(Verse 2)
Yeah
Hey bitch fuck with me, what's up?
Alotta green, alotta lean in my cup
I could show you where I live, bring you over to the crib
Understand that you might just get fucked
Understand that you gon' get woke up
Understand that you might get kicked out
Swear to God me and Willy went to MIA I woke up with my dick in a bitch mouth
In a bitch house?
Nah, I was in the tel dawg, I meant to tell y'all
I met a bitch with a plug on the 5-5 green and every week she gon' send it in the mail, dawg
And I tell y'all that i'm bout my chips
Money and drugs, I get 'em out your bitch
She and her friend givin' me dome but when the bitch get home she got you sleepin' on the couch and shit
She nothin' but a nice fuck, you wifed her
Ho gone fuck your life up, I fill her mouth with white stuff
You keep that heffer iced up and jewelled out
Cause pussy all you think about
My stable of hoes come with clothes to bank accounts
I can't stand

(Devin The Dude)
(Hook x2)
I can't stand (I can't stand) stupid bitches
I keep away, they ain't ridin (my bone)
Have no plans (no plans) with stupid bitches
I tend to stray from stupid bitches

(Verse 3)
For sure
Draka you's a stupid bitch, Anna you's a stupid bitch
Miranda you's a stupid bitch, y'all the type of hoes a nigga can't do shit with
Can't count no dro, can't roll no dope
Ass and a mouth and you still flat broke
Niggas wanna put you on the pedestal, the pussy incredible
I'mma show you how to sell that ho
Now throw that dope in that Rover
Take the hoes coast to coast we getting over
Got pimp partners in South Central with figures on Figueroa
Roll with nothin' but soldiers
That's why I see the bitch in you
I call some women bitches but most these niggas bitches to
Hate me because i'm on, these lames the same song
I'm whippin', dippin', spinnin' chrome
Listenin' to James Joan
Fuck all these bitches, done with these independent women songs
Cause our shop is known, i'm gone fuck with bitches bringing digits home
Nigga what you sippin' on? Cuz what you smokin' like?
Charge it all to a muhfuckin' bitch room, i'm rollin' ho, i'm rollin' right
I told my nigga put 'em back in the pimp game
We whip cause I whip this dick on a bitch mane

(Hook x2)
I can't stand (I can't stand) stupid bitches
