[Verse 1]
Cooked cocaine, put numbers on the set, well who you fuck with?
I just cut four pills up in the deal up in the dope mix
Just fucked up my smoke cause ain't my smoker got my dope kicked
Bitch it ain't no snitching, play cutthroat, you get your throat slit
Bust down jewel Phillipe, I cop a Tec, I got my Rolls blinged
Got expensive taste, won't even take head from a broke bitch
Smoke that kush and pop them Perkies, drank and snort that blow bitch
Back when I was broke, wouldn't even take head from a broke bitch
Or a slut bag or a thot thot
When I was seventeen with a knot knot
And I would chop rocks in the slot box
Shout out to my niggas on the lot lot
We gon' shut it down when the narcs out
Hurt a fuck nigga feelings
When you go and fuck up a check at the car lot
God damn

[Chorus]
Strap on my lap, hop out, hit 'em with the Mac, pop pop
Holes in his chest, Froot Loops, pull up on the set, doo doo
Strap on my lap, hop out, hit 'em with the Mac, pop pop
Holes in his chest, Froot Loops, pull up on the set, doo doo
A hunnid karats on my neck, I put it on the set set
And my wrist is dripping wet, I put it in the set set
Copping foreigns off the lot, I brought it to the set set
Nigga pop and drop a opp I did it for the set set

[Verse 2]
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it hard
Ain't no witness, no weapon, my nigga, I beat the charge
Gotta ice a nigga so my swiper nigga
Put the brand new choppers on the Visa card
Told that pussy nigga that this ain't no motherfucking movie
But you gotta play your part
Get you cut for it
Snap and put it on the what boy
All these rappers got humungous choppers
But I swear they got some baby nuts boy
If you ever bought a chain back from a robber
Nigga you a fuck boy
Putting duct tape on the whole fam
Flexing for the Gram get you touched boy, who you trust boy?
God damn

[Chorus]
Strap on my lap, hop out, hit 'em with the Mac, pop pop
Holes in his chest, Froot Loops, pull up on the set, doo doo
Strap on my lap, hop out, hit 'em with the Mac, pop pop
Holes in his chest, Froot Loops, pull up on the set, doo doo
A hunnid karats on my neck, I put it on the set set
And my wrist is dripping wet, I put it in the set set
Copping foreigns off the lot, I brought it to the set set
Nigga pop and drop a opp I did it for the set set
