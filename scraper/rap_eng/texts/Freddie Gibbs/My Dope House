[Verse 1]
My dope house, my dope house, yeah, trappin' out my dope house
Eat, sleep in the dope house, quarter key worth of dope out
Chillin' in my dope house, my dope house
Niggas stickin' up the dope house
None this shit in my dope house
Porsche stained when I roll out
I show 'em love but I love my money even more
Disrespect, don't pay me? You gots to go
All across the map we shipping them loads
Disrespect and play me? You gots to go
Now Skrewface that's my nigga, Diego that's my nigga
And Big Kill know that if a nigga here try to kill him then I'mma fucking die with him
Cause Freddie keep a .45 with him
ARs and a couple 9s with him
Leaving bodies on the news knock a motherfucker clean out his shoes, better fuck with my niggas

[Hook]
Those fufu boys? We air 'em, coroner's gone stretch 'em out
Popo and detectives gon' be worryin' bout my whereabouts
Those fufu boys? We air 'em, coroner's gone stretch 'em out
Popo and detectives gone be worryin' bout my whereabouts
Don't fuck with me, stay in your lane
Thug everyday and never change, man
And if I see another day
I wake back up and do the same thing
Don't fuck with me, stay in your lane
Thug everyday and never change, man
And if I see another day
I wake back up and do the same thang

[Verse 2]
My dope house, my dope house
Straight blow at the dope house
Popo at the dope house, snitch nigga must have told about it
Down for a kidnap, for a kidnap
Real nigga, we done did that
At the crib with your motherfuckin' mama
And your kids, know where everybody live at
Everybody keep quiet
Everybody on the floor
Everbody gone see
Bitch I'm from the east side
Where everybody sell dope and everybody got heat
Get the dough motherfuckers let the things spray up all day
Hundred murders in a week
Boy got clipped in the project hallway
Ain't nobody gone speak
Niggas mommas gonna weep
I put your face on a shirt and get out of town
Stash all the weed ain't a worry now roll it down
That Ruger hot on my hip and got 30 rounds
I keep my hand on a chopper nigga

[Hook]
Those fufu boys? We air 'em, coroner's gone stretch 'em out
Popo and detectives gon' be worryin' bout my whereabouts
Those fufu boys? We air 'em, coroner's gone stretch 'em out
Popo and detectives gone be worryin' bout my whereabouts
Don't fuck with me, stay in your lane
Thug everyday and never change, man
And if I see another day
I wake back up and do the same thing
Don't fuck with me, stay in your lane
Thug everyday and never change, man
And if I see another day
I wake back up and do the same thang
