[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Cause I'm repping you all day
(La musica de Harry Fraud)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Slammin', kush and pills help me pass out
Nigga hit my line for a stain, bought a half ounce
The homie's low, want some change, pull that mask out
Gonna hit this stick for these things in the stash house
Was some young niggas, some dumb niggas
Stuff a gram of killa in the swisher, I puff it with ya
This is way before the syrup sipping, just hard liquor
Underprivileged niggas hard bitches
Heavy sinning, pray God be with us
(?) and I'm too dirty for church
But I catch that bullet then I found out it's too late to convert
Sometimes I wish I could shift gears and throw my life in reverse
But I live this shit with no regrets, I thug it out till the dirt

[Hook]
Gotta get the 20s, 50s, 100s
Used to ride them hoopties, now I'm in the Benzes, Beamers, stunting
Really from the roaches to that Rolex, it's nothing
That brand new drop top for my nigga homecoming, yeah
Cause I'm repping ya all day, yeah
They all shined now we shine cause we grind
Now we grind the hard way, yeah
Dropping cash on the line for my niggas doing time like all day
Yeah, they all shined now we shine cause we grind
Now we grind all day, yeah
Dropping cash on the line for my niggas doing time like all day

[Verse 2]
Yeah, brought my nigga home, threw him a sack
A few months later them detectives was taking him back
Known to fuck it up, violating probation
Them people got you by the nuts when you stuck on the paper
Money for your lawyer and your bail G
Used to run through bitches with my niggas in hotel suites
Now it seems the only place we dress up is the court room
Feeling like I'm lying when I tell you, you'll be home soon
Really should be sitting witcha
But you kept it solid, didn't wanna put them problems on your nigga
If I was a snitch, couldn't ever look myself up in the mirror
That's what he told me then he showed me
Taking two clips together then rip it, flip it, reload it

[Hook]
Gotta get the 20s, 50s, 100s
Used to ride them hoopties, now I'm in the Benzes, Beamers, stunting
Really from the roaches to that Rolex, it's nothing
That brand new drop top for my nigga homecoming, yeah
Cause I'm repping ya all day, yeah
They all shined now we shine cause we grind
Now we grind all day, yeah
Dropping cash on the line for my niggas doing time like all day
Yeah, they all shined now we shine cause we grind
Now we grind all day, yeah
Dropping cash on the line for my niggas doing time like all day

[Outro]
They all shined now we shine cause we grind
Now we grind all day, yeah
Dropping cash on the line for my niggas doing time like all day
They all shined now we shine cause we grind
Now we grind all day, yeah
Dropping cash on the line for my niggas doing time like all day
They all shined now we shine cause we grind
Now we grind all day, yeah
Dropping cash on the line for my niggas doing time like all day
