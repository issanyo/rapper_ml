[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Straight slammin', thuggin' in the East Bay
Only smoke Northern Cali you know how we play
I treat this music like dope and toss it like free yay'
Chop it like rock and then serve it up to the DJ
Gangsta Gibbs baby, hard narcotic crazy
Wishing I could go back in time and get some dope from the eighties
That Freddie Kane, Freddie Soprano, the Felix Mitchell flow
Reefer got me right, dirty sprite with ice is the ritual
My bitch in San Francisco, she be twisted off a thizzle
Want to have my son or daughter, I started these instrumentals
Bitch I shoot out to LA with like fifty pounds in the rental
Them grams landing, my hand cannon shoot baby missile?
God dammit I'm gat packing, I'm from the crack planet
Chirp service, funerals, graduations, them gats handed
God dammit I'm gat packing, I'm from the crack planet
Fifty K of Fives, tens, twenties in my Craftmatic
