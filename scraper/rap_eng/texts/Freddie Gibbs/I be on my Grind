[Intro:]
The World’s Freshest you bitch
Tonight Show
Yeah yeah

[Chorus:]
Yo
I be on my grind
I be on that, I be on that, full grip on my 9
I be on that with a whole round of kush all out of dimes
Niggas ain’t looking for the hood good smokes
Tell them hoes that I’m on the east side[x2]
Tell them hoes that I’m in the east bank
Tell them hoes that I’m with Hosea in a UHaul truck finishing that gate
Tell the hoes that I got that pack
Fat dope but I got that back
In the strip club with them racks
Ya’ll know that I got that sack

[Verse 1:] [Freddie Gibbs]
Straight games, baby
I make you do something strange for a piece of change baby
Bitch I don’t do kiss or tell
Don't say no names, baby
I throw that ass under the [?]
Fuck or suckin something that’s the mission
If you with us
Straight games, baby
I make you do something strange for a piece of change baby
Bitch I don’t do kiss or tell
Don't say no names, baby
I throw that ass under the [?]
You fuck or suckin something that’s the mission
Gangsta games

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:] [Tra Tha Truth]
Maneuvering through a drop full of gangstas
Where we walk their territory like Picasso’s
Pree every sense of danger
Ever since I got up and got out my major
I was dedicated
Dreaming about them flows
But now the flows are what we elevated
Palamino penthouse graduated the rent house
Forty stories above
All of these niggas tryna get out
Policy guaranteed
Nigga get the message to send out
Pulled up on them
Pulled up again
That’s what they been bout
Exquisite taste
It’s only been legit to match my ego
20K in the belly mention my amigo
Sounded lost to something
That engine move at the speed of light
Bitch get exposed on sites you know where she go’n be tonight
It feels so good, I bless the game
Take them out of rent and redesign em
Into something that cost some change
Even if I switch and callin your highness, they will adapt it
Been to the shops and hit the tramps just to tell them the paper stinkin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:] [Yukmouth]
Elegant thuggin
Honey take in that Louis luggage
I’m big pimpin like Pimp C and that Gucci bucket
My crew disgusting little weezy voiced ya
Mercy with the doors up
Like easy it’s yo boy Yuk
Bang, dragging gang in this thang, nigga
Peace, teeth watching the change on these pain nigga
Galleria shopping, big poppin, Versace frame nigga
Can’t flip up, brace in back of the Range
I’m a bait nigga
Niggas, and I'm an asshole by nature
Selling that Big Daddy Kane on the block
They caught the vapers
Use to Cali, Vegas ballin’ now fuck you haters
Like ‘Bron I took my talents down for that paper
Shout out the Chief and J Prince
Your nigga been paid since
Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Spikes and suede shit
You nigga went for cooking hard right in the basement
To rocking the mics with the ankle bracelet
Gangsta!

[Chorus]
