[Verse 1]
Working white, I got some prices on my life
Some nigga tried to green light me, but I wasn't going
I used to lay up with this bitch, I used to flip
And didn't really give a shit about a nigga flowin'
She was content just tryna grind up to a brick
You could see her in the kitchen whippin' with the soda
I bought a ounce of cocaina 'fore I bent her over
And I remember
When the broads used to put me out, cars I was sleepin' out
Pill habit heavy, hella bars I can't even count
LA county jail, ain't got my moms here to bail me out
Rap game break your homies' hearts if you leave 'em out
Dope game'll leave you with a charge if you gettin' out
Government will fuck a nigga dreams, never live 'em out
I'm trapping on the blade, hella cards I was sweeping out
Rap game break these niggas hearts if you leave 'em out

[Hook]
I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
Said these bitches got it twisted they don't know who to fuck
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna shine like us
Say they ready, I don't think they know it
Yeah, yeah
Say they ready, I don't think they know it
Yeah
Straight to hell where these niggas goin'

[Verse 2]
Yeah, lifestyles of the insane, bang
Cost a little extra tryna be a real nigga
I thought a record contract would get the rent paid
Freddie Kane world tour fuck a deal, nigga
And all the niggas jumped off, that was y'all loss
And they forgot who was the boss and covered all costs
But yesterday a 50 package got 'em all off
I UPS it on the ground, bet they all off
From the pages of a psychopath
And nowadays I never write 'em, just recite 'em, yeah
I put the lighter to the fire, and ignite it, yeah
My neighbor used to hit my alley just to buy a bag
And I remember
When the broads used to put me out, cars I was sleepin' out
Pill habit heavy, hella bars I can't even count
LA county jail, ain't got my moms here to bail me out
Rap game break your homies hearts if you leave 'em out

[Hook]
I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
I say these bitches got it twisted they don't know who to fuck

Yeah, yeah
Say they ready, I don't think they know it

I said, I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
