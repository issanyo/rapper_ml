(sample from Tyrone Davis - 'In the Mood')

Say, bitch don't get too comfortable
Say, bitch don't get too comfortable
Bitch, don't get too comfortable
Never let a bitch get too comfortable
Bitch don't get too comfortable

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
It's mister ho-breaker, dope slanger, dope drinker
Straight hopped up out the coupe, high off that juice, I'm no stranger to this
Getting lit, getting blowed, [?] dipped in gold
Bulls just beat the Lakers in Staples Center, two centerfolds
'Bout to go too deep, I ain't fucked her in like two weeks, feel like two months
And ripping pineapple fanta, fired up two blunts
And this cloud of kush I blow set off the smoke alarm
Fuck it, hash nuggets, Gangsta Gibbs, what you smoking on?
Amber wax and anthrax, bitch I keep a Xan pack
Drop one down in my styrofoam, too high, nowhere to land at
Amber wax and anthrax, bitch I stuff them grams fat
Kick dope down on the floor, and that dope check I'm about to cash that

[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]
Said I'm just rolling with the homies, dope in my styrofoam, man
Said I'm just smoking with the homies, roll up another zone, man

[Verse 2: G-Wiz]
Just scooped my blood bitch in a blue brougham
Leather feel so soft, these hoes like riding with no shoes on
Pineapple and purple the potion, I'm on that candy sip
All I do is player shit, 100% Versace, bitch
One more nigga on the run with the yellow
Ho fine as fuck, from De Janeiro, but she play with her nose though
And I ain't mad at her, because I stay with my medicine
Self-inflicted sticky weed and codeine in my beverage
Pour up on that ice, hit the lights, on some moody shit
Bitches, dope, and dollars on some Tarantino movie shit
Other people's pussy, still keep a whole lot of it
Gold pack in my wallet, with about a seventh of dope in my pocket
Getting blowed

[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]

[Verse 3: G.I. Fleezy]
Like when you feeling good, cause bitch I feel so right
Like moving out my body, purple paint and fanta got me tight
I introduce you to my life, come take a look inside
Bitch, wipe your feet and wipe me down, bitch we don't play around
I'm [?]
How you stay focused and function, bitch we gon' blaze a pound
So when the last time you heard that, yeah we really made for this
So go and send the word back
Right about now, time to tally up a staple
Got them ready, willing, able
Molly-popping, make 'em get down on the floor with the business
And they live for the getting it
Player, out here with it, and that's me
The real player with a G

[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]
