[Intro]
Money and bitches
Niggas die for money and bitches

[Verse 1]
Money and bitches
Niggas die for money and bitches
What I embody is so ungodly, god is my witness
Emotions froze, I'm so cold on every bitch on my team
A rolling stone, I move on like it's a daily routine
I used to have this bitch that had me twisted
Used to get drunk at the club and call me for random visits
She stumbled into my door and I smashed her in the kitchen
Yes she get rough when we sexing, flexing in all positions
Whispered and I often listened, she got a nigga at home
Not quite at home, he took a pitch and since â€˜06 he been gone
She say she grown, she pay her bills and raise her kid on her own
Plus he touch down in a few days, I should just leave her alone
But it's that devil on my shoulder, telling me to come over
3am I hit the gas in my Chevy, blowin on doja
Got me stuck and I can't understand
Why I can't notice, I'm so bogus cause I know her man
I guess I'm dead wrong
Fa sho

[Hook]
Money and bitches make the world spin
Fucking with you can make my world end
How I get caught up in this whirlwind?
Dead wrong, fucking my homeboy's girlfriend
Fuckin my homeboy's girlfriend
But it's your homeboy's girlfriend
Fuckin my homeboy's girlfriend
Lovin my homeboy's girlfriend

[Verse 2]
I wish I had the nuts to tell you this
While you was locked away in jail I was out here nailing your bitch
I even helped out with the house note, the car payments and shit
I never thought about our friendship, I just thought with my dick
And I was dead wrong, on bogus shit from the start
Cause of this lust in my mind, I carried this guilt in my heart
I be so weak to let a piece of pussy peel us apart
If you found out about this shit, might twist your feelings in knots
Speaking of feelings, I caught em
Big bag of dreams and I bought em
Visions of me and her stuck on an island hideaway balling
Sometimes I don't return her calls and pray one day she be off it
But yo it seems like since he came home, she been calling more often
Damn..guess she addicted to the way I treat her
Because she right back at my doorstep everytime that he beat her
Fussing and crying saying baby I need you, why you ignore me?
Testing me, stressing me, how dare she question my loyalty?
Damn

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Money and bitches
Niggas die for money and bitches
Trying to stay occupied, so I stay out there fucking bitches
But my affairs with this woman was extremely indecent
Truth is my homie got every right to come leave me leaking
Woke up with my phone on fire
Twenty, thirty missed calls
Called him back, he picked it up and I could tell he pissed off
He told me, bitch nigga, you see me, walk the other way
No room for explanation, just jump straight into pistol play
All them years we go back just got flushed down the toilet
Might lose my life behind this bitch, but man I just can't afford it
Whole situation could have been avoided
I wonder what went through his head when he picked up that loaded pistol and pointed
Like damn..if I can't have you in life, I guess I'll have you in death
Finished her off with 3 shots and turned the fifth on himself
Was it really love or did we both all fall for a sleazy broad?
Killed his girl and spared my fucking life, who had the deeper bond?
Damn
