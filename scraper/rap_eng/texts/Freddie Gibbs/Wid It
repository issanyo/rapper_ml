[Hook: Problem] (x2)
Everyday of my life tryna get it
Ingle' to Roma to Wright
But everybody still wid it
But everybody still wid it

[Verse 1: Problem]
Half a pill for the turn up
Marijuana aroma, block is hot as tacoma
Coppers hitting the corner
Baby mama's is texting
Met me a new bitch now baby mama's is stressing
School it couldn't get the lesson
Thank the Lord for your blessings
Even if you do it bad everyday by is for lessons
Lights, I'm on constant
Flights, cause I'm smoking
Good, yeah I'm living life to the fullest
Yeah I'm the nigga cause I motherfuckin chose to be
Now it's finally the way that it's supposed to be
Tread [?]  with the bread spend it low for me
And bitch you can't unless you buy a gold roll for me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
I'm focused, hustling til I get death
Chasing after this paper, get to it like I won't get left
Robert with this De Niro like I don't envision shit else
Stop with the [?] bitch your ass ain't touching else
In the streets like a flash light, haters meant that I shine on em
I heart they're taking [?] but they deal em when I put mine on em
Touch down and put that [?] on em
[?], recline on em
[?]bitch to their checkers, never rush, I take my time on em
I hear they talking down, oddly cause I'm too above niggas
I tell em suck my dick, no second guessing, ain't no love nigga Money done ride my dick, tell em to kiss my ass
And watch me kill em everyday like its my last

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Everyday I smoke a ciggy [?]
Blessings in the month of Ramadhan
Thousands of people line up just to see a nigga rhyme
Ball [?], I get lawyer to pay for a nigga time
Clock in by the hour, guns [?] from powder
Really [?] started ESGN  and got niggas sour
That bitch can't come around here
Niggas just won't allow her
But if I catch her out bet that pussy gon' get devoured
Pimpin, keep it in me, I keep a cold ass bitch
Had to cuss some niggas off, that was on some ho ass shit
Hurt my heart, it was some niggas I used to throw down with
Now I ain't got shit to give ya ass before the programmes begin
I live my life

[Hook]
