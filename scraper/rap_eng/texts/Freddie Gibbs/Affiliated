[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Niggas know what I'm affiliated with
I'm quick to bust a move
And bust yo' windows for this paper bitch
Niggas get all off Gibbs
They don't wanna get into this gangsta shit
Fryin' yo' ass in front of yo' family yo that's my favorite
Shit to do to niggas
Bet you runnin' through these niggas
Like a pack of condoms
Sick just like a passed the flu to niggas
I was diplomatic
But this shit was gettin' through to niggas
The way these faggots be acting
Make me just wanna shoot at niggas
Go back to my roots on niggas
A SK and a shadeball
Leave your crib one day without choppers you gon' be dead dog
Burn some niggas off and then paid the cost over bread dog
Busta came in asked for some credit
But I'm like "Hell naw'"
If I was Jimmy henchman
I would have been left the country
Fuck the snitches and pussy polices
Them niggas monkeys
Ten pounds of kush and a set of speakers
That shit was funky
I just needed drugs
I'm a plug wrapping this shit before me

[Verse 2: Reks]
Spazzmatic cabbage cranium classic
Deliver bastard bars
Freddie and Statik
Pushing the pad
Pinnacle General as if
I be as mad and can fill syllables
In lyrical paragraphs
Or scribbling battle raps
Or story verses
They gon' need hearses
Undertaker mother nature
You be one with makers
Son to say your passion
Haysoos(Jesus) sip great goose
Henny yeah reminisce
R-E-K-S Genesis
The revolution's evolution
Till revelation
You made your bed with satan
Game is full of hella hatin'
I'm baking a book of statements
For real MC's
To kill the likes of
Little B's
Enemies
Turn to mini Me's
Lord of Gary
R and Freddie killin' beats
Pinnacle of [?]
To the owens
[?]
I'm omens to all men
Poker table all in
Get to know the label
Yall' showin' off
We the spokemen

[Verse 3: Push!]
Lights camera action!
It's the main attraction
Nothing like the rest of these faggots
The bullshit on the radio
Heard by masses
I'm MJ with a team full of Kerrs and Paxtons
Squad of shooters
With black rugers
Baby mama wallin'
True to the stash looters
You can ask around
Know Push keep it the truest
Looking at the American version of [?]
[?] Nigga fuck it I do this
Need to come holler at your boy
And get some [?]
Might see me with thirty grand in front of hipsters
But I'm knee deep in the street
Don't get me mixed up
I'm dirty It's best to be cool fam
Shit, I'm Tim Taylor with the tool man
Play Wilson and I peek over the gate
Soon as I see your brow
Squeeze it in your face
