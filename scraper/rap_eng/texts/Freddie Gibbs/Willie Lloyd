[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Can't tell me a mothafuckin' thing, bruh
Yeah, straight from hood like
Yeah, had my nets on this devil, yeah
Yeah, show them niggas
Told them niggas, I'ma show them niggas, what up
Yeah, told them niggas and I show them niggas, where at
Yeah, told them niggas and I show them niggas, where at
Ugh, yeah

[Verse: Freddie Gibbs]
Straight out the sewer like Das EFX
Which one you fuck niggas want it next
In my dreams I see faces of death
I'ma pray for you hoes, get your Rosary, cross your chest
Young Soprano can't fade me like Thanos
I just shipped a whole damn piano up out the west
Hit Chicago, might fuck around ball out like Rilo
And go put 500 thangs on the jet
I just picked up 500 thangs on the strip
Nigga rap with a hundred pack in the Lyft
OG niggas they told me that they still be movin'
That they had the hook up since '96
Black Tony told 'em Chichi get the yay'
Line of scrimmage, Peyton Manning, switch the play
Pour the holy water all up in the Jesus piece
Wash a real nigga's sins away
Yeah, took it from the devil's mouth
I hammer dance on the roof of the devil's house
Chop a dime bag or drum with the metal out
Percocet, weed and codeine brought the devil out
Brought dope in momma house, let the devil in
Dropped a zip, took a loss, ain't gon' never win
I'm so sick of these fuckin' rap groupies
I need to go find some good pussy to settle in
Hit my plug with the strap
Pussy boy wanna jack up the pack, and a nigga can't settle for it
I just hit up the jack
All he do is smoke wet on the steps and a nigga might wet 'em for it
Six figures, most niggas never saw it
Almighty dollar, nigga can't ignore it
Light, gas bill, nigga can't afford it
Put him on that wet and nigga wet 'em for it
Yeah
Fin ball rollin', catch me chuckin' up the vatos locos
Bitch, I run the deck like Willie Lloyd
A nigga got the fans and the feds takin' photos
Know it's A-1 yola, when you see the logo
Made a half a milli off a Motorola
Percy Miller with the baking soda
Silkk the Shocker rock, I got C-Murder motives
I'm a giant, niggas standin' on my shoulders
Gave them niggas game, now they throwin' shade

[Outro]
I know Folks, Crips, Bloods, Renegades
Got respect drippin' from a nigga name
Finna load this seat, seekers in the gauge
Drugs loaded in me when I hit the stage
And the Folks, Crips, Bloods, Renegades
Got respect drippin' from a nigga name
Nigga what
I know Folks, Crips, Bloods, Renegades
Got respect drippin' from a nigga name
Nigga what, yeah
Yeah, Big Lord Bunny Rabbit nigga
Bout to chef a package then it's automatic
Nigga what
