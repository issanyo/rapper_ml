Yea
Yo career on the line nigga
I know yall niggas shook
Entire industry shook nigga
It's over

Yeah, to all the killers and a hundred dollar billas (Indiana stand up)
The real niggas who ain't got no feelings (I need my city with me on this one)

Yea
Now everybody from the 219
Smoke a dime of the prime, while I spit this rhyme
Everybody from the 219
Smoke a dime of the prime, while I spit this rhyme

Yo
I got you stuck off the realness
My city infamous
You heard of us?
Dem Gary Indiana murderas'
Life in a Steel City, can get real pretty
That's why I'm on the block without the steel with me
And I ain't never been afraid of shook
I hit the scene and bitch niggas afraid to look
Why?
'Cuz they don't wanna make eye contact
Don't mean mug me if you ain't ready for combat
I'm on a level that these other rappers can't come close to
So homie play yo' position like you supposed to
I can see it inside of yo' face, you in a wrong place
Cowards like you just get they whole body laced up, with bullet holes and such
To the head, to the gut, we don't ain't givin' a fuck
Shook niggas betta duck while I'm hittin' 'em up
Act tough, I had an ambulance pickin 'em up
Nah, fuck that, you in the coroner van
I murder you and I then put da 44' to yo' man
You understand, don't make me have to call yo' name out
'Cuz you a featherweight, my gunshots will make you levitate
I'm in my early twenty's but my mind is old
Start rapping when I was nineteen cuz my rhymes was cold
I put a pen to my paper and tell my story
Life is a risk, no guts, no glory
Ain't No Tamin, my orginazation
You fuckin' with a animal, you don't know what you facin'
Bring yo' whole gang, let Freddie hurt yo' nation
It'll get bloodier then Freddie vs Jason
I'll send you to Hell, to the burning sensation
Gettin' close to a single, and tight situation now
Take these words homie, think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you

Son, they shook...
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They Scared to death, They scared to look
They shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They Scared to death, They scared to look nigga

Yea
Now everybody from the 219
Smoke a dime of the prime, while I spit this rhyme (yea)
Everybody from the 219
Smoke a dime of the prime, while I spit this rhyme (yea)
Yea
Everybody from the 219
Smoke a dime of the prime, while I spit this rhyme (nigga)

Yea
There it is
What it is
What it's gonna be
Freddie Gibbs
Gary, Indiana in the mutha' fuckin' building
219 ride with me
If you ain't ridin' with me, you know what I'm sayin
Mother had you, Mother loved you, Mother fuck you, you nah mean
You SHOOK, nigga

Gibbs
