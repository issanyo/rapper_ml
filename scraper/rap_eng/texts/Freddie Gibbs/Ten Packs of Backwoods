Ten packs of backwoods bitch that's how my day go
Still got that loud pack bitch I'm on my J O
And my hoes don't roll no swisher sweets cause they know
Ten packs of backwoods bitch that's how my day go

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Ten packs of the backwoods filled with the kush, I'm so blown
But you know the kid still handle biz, I don't lead to the door sober
Fuckin' with a made nigga, paid nigga gettin' change in the dope spot
Cadillac two shit, new shit, no bricks on my door lock
Bitch I stay funeral fresh, Fendi and Gucci to death
Get all my bottom bitches, I ain't have shit to do with the rest
My bitches down to take trips, my bitches down to hit licks, my bitches roll the wood up, throw up the hood up sip lean and get lit
And when I die bury me right by bitch Mary Jane
She been by my side ever since '95 with a beat to everything
Wake up first thing on my list gotta taste that bitch, that's how my day go
Then a nigga hit a broad and her friend, so 20 on the thang, yeah I'm on my J O

Ten packs of backwoods bitch that's how my day go
Still got that loud pack bitch I'm on my  J O
And my hoes don't roll no swisher sweets cause they know
Ten packs of backwoods bitch that's how my day go

[Verse 2: D-Edge]
Got 50 packs with stuff of that loud, my day go
Yellow pack, blue, purple, brown, light and dark every day in my J O
Keep a flight attendant when I fly to the city, she ride and go
That cali medical walked up that side blow like Diego
And they know, keep my day right smokin' till my lungs buzz
Some'll wrap another wood and stop it with an orange crush
Train wreck in them honey berries, ba-bananas with that bubba
O.G. wrapped in a sweet era, madness come after, I take no other
Pack after pack, roll up and choke out and smoke out sack after sack
Then bring it back, another 10 rounds by woods and we vacayin' in the back
Hop in the 'lac, another 28 grams be in hand til I lay low
Blew 'em back, on the eight, 20  keep my mind straight, gettin' head from my new and my day ho
