[Verse 1]
I woke up and wrote this for my hater, mane
Forgis on that thing with a four fifty four, I'll see you later, mane
Bitches gonna bop, tell 'em pop that pussy for this paper, mane
Ho just wanna kick it, so I backseat Escalade her, mane
Thugging, and if you with me then you do the same
Got some partners doing life for the thing we do for this change
Tried the rap shit cause my big homie told me switch up my lane
Nigga, this trap shit get you stuck in a grave or locked in a cage, mane
Yeah, I put my ski mask on and fucking came up, came up
Staying on this thug shit, bitch, I fuck the game up, game up
And you know this rap shit ain't gon' fucking change us, change us
Real Midwest gangstas hit ya plug and flame up, flame up
Dumping hollow tips for my enemies like yeah
Fuck you pussy boys in this industry like yeah
Fuck the records, I'm knee deep in the streets
New white girl on my phone, keep the Nikes up on my niece's feet like yeah

[Hook x2]
I jumped off in the streets and fucking came up
Forgis on everything, I fuck the game up
Woke up and wrote this for my fucking haters
That hate the way a nigga came up

[Verse 2]
Uh came up, I'm never coming down
Nigga ain't have shit, sat the bench, now bitch I run the town
Heard niggas in the street want me hit, heard I can't come around
Nigga stepped all through your event, yeah bitch I shut it down
Thugging, and if you with me you'd be on a job
Private party, fifty freaks in a suite for me and my squad
Me and my partners, Gary, deep in the streets, less than a mob
Had a chopper thing, go beat down your block and then beat the cops, mane
Yeah, I stepped off in the booth and fucking came up, came up
Every tape I drop made these little niggas step they game up, game up
Nigga heard Young Gibbs, now it seem his flow done changed up, changed up
But I don't give no fuck, little nigga, my dues been paid up
Now bust hollow tips for my enemies like yeah
Fuck you pussy boys in this industry like yeah
Fuck your records, I'm knee deep in the streets
Got white girl on my phone nigga, whip it up if you feeling me like yeah
