[Verse 1]
Gangsta G-I, nigga I sell bricks
Whippin, wrappin, nigga get your yell' shipped
Pack it, sack it, when that yayo bussed down
In the kitchen, dabbin, Cam Newton touchdown
Nigga slangin, bangin, in here throwin' gang signs
I got molly, kush and chrissy on the same line
Got my Cutlass, bumpin, paint that bitch, I need shoes
Got me thuggin', juggin', made me feel like fuck school, nigga

[Verse 2]
I know that that's your bitch but that's my bitch too
The jeweller lit my wrist, I lit her wrist too
Got tickets to the show, them hoes get sent through
I make her pop her pussy like her rent due
Trappin' at the stove, trappin' at the stove
You know them bitches chose, know them bitches chose
Diamonds in the Rolls, diamonds in the Rolls
Money cash hoes, money cash hoes

[Verse 3]
Gangsta G-I, nigga, I can sell a whole one
Flippa, thrilla, Michael Jackson at the stove
Lassie, puppie, bet them dogs gon' bite
Killer, my niggas, serve all white
I got choppers, I be pressin' and flexin' on all my enemies
It ain't no love in these streets, it ain't no sympathy
I keep a Glock, he on deck and I got that shit with me
My jewellery on, but ain't no nigga gon' Shy Glizzy me
Thug life, nigga thug life
I die today, and I come back,  and be a thug twice
Trappin' at the stove, trappin' at the stove
Money cash hoes, money cash hoes
