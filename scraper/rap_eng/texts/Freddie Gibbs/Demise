[Intro: Ransom]
Uh huh
It's real glorious
Painful at the same time though
I know y'all hear me
Presidential
Yeah

[Hook: Ransom]
When two gangstas collide
You can look a nigga eye to eye
And tell him why
Somebody probably gotta die
Them niggas sitting plotting our demise
We on the rise
These two gangstas arrive
A man is not a man without his pride
It's no surprise
Our main goal's to survive
Until my soul's floating in the sky
I tell 'em why

[Verse 1: Ransom]
Me and Gibbs back to back fuck the middleman
Big chopper say hello to my little friend
On the corner playing dice until I win again
Fuck the law, put me in the ring to fight Zimmerman
Homicide looking for a fingerprint
We at the rose bar toasting to my ignorance
These crackers can't believe that I'm innocent
Jon Gotti swag hopping in the limo Benz
The gritty tales from a nigga from a dark block
Rest in peace to that nigga that's from Far Rock
And to this very day it's still a soft spot
I wish I had a last word before his heart stopped
I swear these rap niggas is a joke
Every nigga got a choppa, every nigga selling coke (nope)
I'm the type of nigga that you don't wanna approach
Killing paper with this pen cuz it's murder that i wrote

[Hook: Ransom]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, this that razor sharp guillotine rap
Straight out the land of microwave crack and machine gats
Trip to New York I bet niggas buy what I bring back
Life sentence worth of dope in the trunk I done seen that
OGs never showed me was way too greedy to teach me
I'll chunk a deuce and throw up the Rollie no need for speakin'
Don't need a ? to picture me rollin and see me creepin
Or I'll pop out with that choppa, we even,  ? seein polices
I got donkey in that super sport
I'm valet parking on candy, you in that Uber boy
Black 45 with no masks that's how I do ya boy
Nigga what the fuck you got shooters if you ain't gon' use 'em for
You losin boy, gangsta got your bitch to blow me with
Barry White on the Beats Pill
Freddie Kane baby, the wolf dressed as the sheep still
Nigga went from straight don status to dirty black bastard
Evil seed till I bleed, hold it down for Ransom

[Hook: Ransom]
