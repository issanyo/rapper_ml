[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
My flow so traumatic, I'm down to cause static
My producer got more tracks than a heroin addict
But he sorta like a dope man
Cause when he gimme my fix, I'm sinkin' in an abyss, that's what I need to exist
Cause I'm a junkie, a fiend for rap, a fiend for tracks
I'm hooked, like a fiend for crack
I want the world to get hooked on my spiritual rhymes
So go ahead, take a hit, snort these lyrical lines
Let 'em penetrate ya brain, without it I'd be insane
Rap made a nigga change, I ain't never been the same
Now my mama and my daddy think I'm crazy, loc'd out
The mic is like a pipe and the booth is a dope house
When I'm throwin' I'm satisfied
Give up rappin', kick the habit? no I'd rather die
Rap is like a controlled substance cause it really give me a buzz
So if you ain't got the love then you should say no to drugs, wut

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
I got this monkey on my back and I can't shake it
I need a daily dose or I don't think that I'mma make it
These beats and rhymes support my habit
Cause I need it, I gotta have it, gotta grab it, I'm a rap addict
I got this monkey on my back and I can't shake it
I need a daily dose or I don't think that I'mma make it
These beats and rhymes support my habit
Cause I need it, I gotta have it, gotta grab it, I'm a rap addict

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
And I ain't always rapped, I been rappin' since I was nineteen
Now I'm twenty-one, this is more than just a pipe dream
I think of rhymes while I'm rollin' down the street
I rap all day, I even rap in my sleep
I rap while I'm in the bed, rap when I wake up
I'm heavy in this rap shit, nigga get ya weight up
I'm addicted to spittin' flows, ain't no rehabilitation
And if you battle me, prepare for your elimination
Cause I don't really think you gifted like me
You ain't on my level, you ain't addicted like me
I eat, sleep, and breathe this rap shit
Cause I'm a professional, but you muthafuckas need some practice
Y'all niggas should appreciate this talent I'm givin' y'all
The game's in pain, I'm 'bout to kill it like demerol
I do it for the streets, keep it gully on a track
I'm addicted to rap, can't get this monkey off my back

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
I got this monkey on my back and I can't shake it
I need a daily dose or I don't think that I'mma make it
These beats and rhymes support my habit
Cause I need it, I gotta have it, gotta grab it, I'm a rap addict
I got this monkey on my back and I can't shake it
I need a daily dose or I don't think that I'mma make it
These beats and rhymes support my habit
Cause I need it, I gotta have it, gotta grab it, I'm a rap addict

[Interlude: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, I need it, gotta have it, I'm a rap addict
Cause I need it, I gotta have it, I'm a rap addict
I know I need it, gotta have it, I'm a rap addict
I know I need it, gotta have it, I'm a rap addict
I know I need it, gotta have it, I'm a rap addict
I know I need it, gotta have it, I'm a rap addict
I know I need it, gotta have it, I'm a rap addict
I know I need it, gotta have it, I'm a rap addict

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
This is my mind, body, and soul, my pain, my love
This is my lyrical addiction, my brain on drugs
Hip hop came in my life and shook my world
My dedication to this music made me lose my girl
She sayin' I don't spend quality time
Cause I'm hooked on hooks, addicted to beats, and quality rhymes
And I'm never gonna stop, I'mma be the one to flow the most
Rap 'till I'm comatose, die from a overdose

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
I got this monkey on my back and I can't shake it
I need a daily dose or I don't think that I'mma make it
These beats and rhymes support my habit
Cause I need it, I gotta have it, gotta grab it, I'm a rap addict
I got this monkey on my back and I can't shake it
I need a daily dose or I don't think that I'mma make it
These beats and rhymes support my habit
Cause I need it, I gotta have it, gotta grab it, I'm a rap addict
