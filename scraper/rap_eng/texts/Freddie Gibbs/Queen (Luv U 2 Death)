[Verse 1]
(Gun Shots)
She like the realest shit I ever wrote
She like a drug addiction for my pain and sickness
She the antidote, like the most killest shit I ever smoked
Her color and the texture of skin, boost my high with every stroke
She got a steady gig, own car, own crib, no kids
Let's start a family baby, I'm convinced
You that stability that my life lack
The type of Woman that make a gangsta wanna clean up his act
And baby I know I get out of line sometimes
But understand that all I do, I do for us, you gotta respect my grind
I play the cost that I was dealt the best a nigga could do
Won't let my street position weaken my position with you
Because you my Queen, put nothing above you and I'mma show you
Please don't worry bout them bitches before you, Cuz they below you
You the perfect verse, perfect Earth to plant my seed
You know what I mean you my Queen, I love you to death

[Hook]
She been here with me through it all
And even when a nigga fall
She be right there to pick me up again
Sometimes I feel like she my only friend
The only person I can trust
The only one I can confide in
Man she the only thing I really need
She like the perfect verse, perfect Earth to plant my seed
She the type to fix my meal and twist my green
Y'all know what I mean? She's my Queen
I love her to death

[Verse 2]
If she was selling pussy, She'd be on a gold mine
Hard to take attention away from something that's so fine
And every time I see ya, I'm in the panties in no time
Liquor in the morning, she make the breakfast with no swine
Eggs, turkey bacon with the cheese and the grits
In the crib I hide the pills and the weed by the brick
About a half by the O, Little Ron, Little snow
I don't bring my niggas over there so don't nobody know
Until one day my girl was taking off to go to the store
Two mothafuckas with them choppas walked her back in the door
They like, Yo gimme the dope, the weed, the money out the bedroom
Make it snappy bitch, I'm about to put one in her head soon
Man I don't know shit about no dope or no weed
She like, baby please give em what they want so they can leave
Niggas stuck me for my cheese and disrespected my Queen
On my momma I'mma make them niggas bleed, I love you to Death

[Hook]
She been here with me through it all
And even when a nigga fall
She be right there to pick me up again
Sometimes I feel like she my only friend
The only person I can trust
The only one I can confide in
Man she the only thing I really need
She like the perfect verse, perfect Earth to plant my seed
She the type to fix my meal and twist my green
Y'all know what I mean? She's my Queen
I love her to death

[Verse 3]
She my French vanilla butter pecan chocolate deluxe
Most these niggas act like bitches, but she the bitch that I trust
Since them niggas left me stuck, My pockets been fucked up
He and She don't feel like We, It's Me and Her
Fuck us Fuss cuss Fuck fight, under the same roof
I think this bitch just set me up and now I just need proof
She getting random calls, random texts from her ex
It didn't take too long for me to make the dots connect
And bitch you know me and this nigga got beef
I can't believe you down to sacrifice my life to put him back on his feet
He out here flossing with my money and you breaking bread with him
Motherfuck him if you love him, I'mma leave you dead with him
I was down to give my life for you, wife for you
Loved you from the start, stanking ass bitch you breaking my heart
Ho I should shoot you in yo face, close-casket your wake
But I'mma show respect and bang you in the chest, I love you to (Gun shot)
