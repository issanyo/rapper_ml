[Intro]
I’m from that, that era nigga, that
That crack era you know what I’m sayin'

[Verse 1]
Freddie Gordy, Freddie Kane, nigga
Choppin’ corners on the blade nigga
Vvs' in the chain nigga
Ever since I got a name nigga
Mexicanos and Italianos I’m a mafioso I’m a made nigga
Coke and Rezzy on the plane nigga
Ever since I got a name nigga
Ever since I can’t remember I been round them dealers, addicts and the alcoholics
See some niggas get addicted to this ballin'
Hear my niggas flushed the heroine down the toilet
For them new hundreds in a nigga wallet
Gonna shoot something don’t get a nigga started
Gotta screw lose don’t wanna catch a body
Chopper big as a tank boy I guess I'm bout it bout it
Yeah, nigga flex, get wet, that’s how shit goes
When niggas player hate me like some hoes
Fuck the fame I just want my paper stackin'
Sex for breakfast get head up in the mansion
Fuck your bitch in the  set she gave me action
Keep a Glock on my hip I’m never lackin'
Keep a line on that pack I’m never lackin'
Fuck your bitch different day she gave me action
I pulled up in that Porsche for they reaction
Living like a nigga that ain’t never had nothin'
Cociana a pound got a nigga never pass up
Chop it on a table let a nigga bag up
Rollin' with some niggas that ain't scared to mask up
I be in the places where they fire that glass up
Bout to watch a geeker nigga smoke his last up
Stomach bout to turn but I gotta man up
Crack smoke fill the room while I'm countin' cash up
Feeling like I’m Tony while I’m countin' cash up
Used to be a nigga that a bitch'd pass up
Nigga feelin' evident, got passion in this rappin, so
A nigga feel a way when he ain’t  on the line up
A nigga feel a way when he ain’t on the playlist
And if you feel a way they say you on some lame shit
A nigga supposed to feel like he's the coldest nigga walking
Bitch I got it out the mud I got it out the pavement
My hoes got special arrangements
In the beginning the picture get painted
We having fun fuck off get faded
If you ain't with it you'll lay with the lame niggas

[Break]
Two to the brain nigga
Two to the brain nigga
(Pop Pop)
That’s what it take to take me out
I rob that ice out that house
I’m cool in the game nigga

Two to the brain nigga
Two to the brain nigga
Just caught El Chapo
Cause he was tryna get on camera chasing the fame nigga

[Verse 2]
He probably gon' break out in a coupla days nigga
And if he do then hit me I’m tryna get paid witchu
It’s crazy how this drug shit really done raised niggas
It’s hard to keep the niggas that came in the game witchu
It’s crazy how this drug shit really done raised niggas
It’s hard to keep the niggas that came in the game witchu
