[Chorus x2: Freddie Gibbs]
Everybody got their time, any time a day
Darker night, everybody got a price to pay
Everybody see their fate, better keep ya faith
Will I see the flames of hell or the pearly gates?

[Verse One: Freddie Gibbs]
Gangsta Gibbs, 2 balls, 1 man, 2 feet, 1 six feet deep
The other foot up in a six by six
Do the math, sell dope or hit a 5-5 lick
We go to jail and die by this shit
It ain't a coincidence that niggas where I reside die quick
I'm right in the thick of this shit
Right in the midst of the pimps, pushers and hoes
Some niggas take the needle, some take it straight up the nose
Then they graduate to loading that pipe up
Fucking with these drugs got me fucking my life up
And the dro I roll that, repeatedly blow that
Sometimes I like to lace my swisha sweets and get towed back
And the yo' I sold that, although I know that
A hundred million dollars couldn't buy my soul back
You can't save me with your pastor or your congregation
I talk to God everyday, but me and satan still have our conversations
Maybe the lord can help my complications
If heaven turn me down then hell got my reservation
I'mma continue blazing

[Chorus x2: Freddie Gibbs]
Everybody got their time, any time a day
Darker night, everybody got a price to pay
Everybody see their fate, better keep ya faith
Will I see the flames of hell or the pearly gates?

[Verse Two: Hades]
This Hades and Freddie Gibbs, that's them two midwest boys
That pocket full of crack, I'm still living that death boy
...?
I whip a range, now a ferrari's my next toy
Guess you would say I'm on top of the world, huh?
It's hard to sleep at night when your friends in a pearl box
It's when I'm close to wake up in the bed decisions stop
Fuck is you talking 'bout lil nigga? I'm getting guap
I know my time's coming on this big ass ice watch
My ? searching for me but I don't give a fuck, pops
See where I'm from, when you broke the love stops
It's no better feeling then the one you get on top
And I ain't talk about none of that rap shit
I been broke before and I ain't tryin to go back, bitch
Do what I gotta do to get this money and stack it
Every dog got his day but I ain't worried 'bout that shit

[Chorus x2: Freddie Gibbs]
Everybody got their time, any time a day
Darker night, everybody got a price to pay
Everybody see their fate, better keep ya faith
Will I see the flames of hell or the pearly gates?
