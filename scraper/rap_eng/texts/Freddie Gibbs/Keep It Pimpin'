(Freddie Gibbs)
(Verse 1)
It's Gibbs baby the golden child coldest nigga in my click
Keep it pimpin' so I keep it tight as bitches on my dick
I'm a motherfucker that'll get a bitch and tap that booty for a couple stacks
Then having her give me more dough as soon as she get her taxes back
I spit that game, you know my name
F-R-E double D to the I-E
Ho don't try me, I got bitches from Canada to Hawaii
And I don't need 'em, I let the government feed 'em
When I meet 'em, I mistreat 'em and leave 'em
If they got money I keep 'em
