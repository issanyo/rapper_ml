[Intro]
Yea
Another day in the life
Shit still ain't right
One time for your muhfuckin mind, murda
Its either you or me dog
If I got anything to do with it
Its gonna be you motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Yeah, another day in the life
Another penitentiary chance, another crime
Another dollar outta 5 pennies in a dime
Only thing I'm lackin is time and that ain't guaranteed
High speed on the highway, henny and hella weed
In my bloodstream , the drug scene is never ending
So fuck them other niggas I ain't getting cheddar with them
Peep the mathematics, I clap em and paramedics get em
50 magazine and my 40 mean there's 11 in em
Now can you niggas comprehend that, live that
Duck shots from a gat, strategize get back
I think there's about to be a murder
Hop out the window, I'm at your temple with my burner
Never been a stranger to the gun play, bust that get away
I know that Imma have to pay on judgement day
Around my way niggas don't live to see their hair turn grey
I be excited if I make it to my next birthday

[Chorus]
Now can you feel that
Cuz this is really how it is where I live at
Be careful what you wishing for, you can get that
So get back, if the beef don't concern ya, i think its bout to be a murda
Now can you feel that
Cuz this is really how it is where I live at
Be careful what you wishin for, you can get that
I stay strapped, passed up all black with my burner
Cuz its bout to be a murda

[Verse 2]
I had to hit that nigga first he was gonna murda me
I caught him with his homies had to murda all three
Of the bitches he had wit him I did it properly
Take care of the snitches and witnesses that's the policy
We live by, real niggas kill by
Death is gettin closer when yo soldiers in the field die
Nigga whats the motive, money, paper, cheddar, green is the motivation
Zero tolerance for disrespect you get retaliation
O nation, I don't get a fuck about them other niggas
Ready to make em say "he shot the fuck up out them other niggas"
I'ma load up my k and handle my fuckin business
Til the niggas kill me, god as my witness
I gotta a itchy trigga finga and the nuts of an elephant
Knock your stuffin out yo fuckin muffin just for the hell of it
Nigga dont make me follow you to your residance
Im behind you with the burner, its been a murda

[Chorus]
Now can you feel that
Cuz this is really how it is where I live at
Be careful what you wishing for, you can get that
So get back, if the beef don't concern ya, i think its bout to be a murda
Now can you feel that
Cuz this is really how it is where I live at
Be careful what you wishin for, you can get that
I stay strapped, passed up all black with my burner
Cuz its bout to be a murda

[Outro x2]
Bitch niggas they get murda murda murda
Snitch niggas they'll get murda murda murda
Talkin that shit will get you murda murda murda
Bout that murda murda, its about to be a murda
