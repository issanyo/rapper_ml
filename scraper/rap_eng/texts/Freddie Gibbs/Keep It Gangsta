Take off my jewellery and beat it up with the lights on
Say Gibbs getting sloppy on the bay bridge
By a Phillipino part Jamaican bitch
Headed to the trap house
Looking for that pack now

Nigga made a living off this gangsta shit i rap bout
Motherfuck every single police and what they ask bout
Shoutout to my niggas in the FED

Pussy stamps on my passport
