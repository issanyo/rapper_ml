[Intro]
What it is?
Or wassup?
Got your nigga in the cut, god damn!
League of Starz

[Pre-Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
You know, you know, you know a nigga tryna fuck some, smoke some
Yeah the club probably want some to post some
Old school want to bust some, I love some
Yeah you can probably tell them we brought some to fuck some, fuck some

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
What it is, hoe?
Or wassup?
Can a nigga get up in them guts?
Fuck it up like you ain't been fucked
Bust it open, let my niggas get a nut

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Now I'ma speak in a language that you can understand
You know we may never meet again
I’m only in your city for the night
So you should let me get it, get it, get it all night
(Can I get that or nah?)
Let a nigga know what's up, let a nigga know what’s good
(Let a nigga know that)
Let a nigga know what's real, let a nigga know what it is

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
What it is, ho?
Or wassup?
Can a nigga get up in them guts?
Fuck it up like you ain't been fucked
Bust it open, let my niggas get a nut

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Baby, give me your number
I probably fuck her and won't call her
Bitch I'm a mother fuckin' baller
The bench to the starter
I fuck around and tear the mall up
And make the strippers pick it all up
A nigga trying to fuck some, smoke some
Get the club running bust some to poke some
Old school going to bust some, I love some
Yeah they probably tellin' fold some to fuck some, fuck some
What it is hoe?
I cut the money let them bag that
I smell the pig with your bad jack
Need something slim with a fat back
[?? 1:32] put her pussy on Snapchat

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
What it is, ho?
Or wassup?
Can a nigga get up in them guts?
Fuck it up like you ain't been fucked
Bust it open, let my niggas get a nut

[Bridge: Freddie Gibbs]
Girl, I know you want to fuck some, fuck some
Girl, you know I want to fuck some, fuck some
Girl, I know you want to fuck some, fuck some
Girl, I know you want to fuck some, fuck some
(What it is?)

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
Standing in my section and bitch is looking in my direction
She want me to hit it but I don't got no protection
Ain’t no time for playing ain't no time for second guessing
I’ma call an Uber and she gon' pull up to the Westin (skurr, skurr, skurr)
Switching all my swagger, I’ma hit her with the dagger
She want to ride the dick she gotta climb up on the ladder
She got to have plenty chips gettin' benefits
Slim thick, nice crib and a nice whip
I can't fuck with no bootsee bitch, no
Playing with my bread like Busta Bust' I flip modes
Whoa, get dough or the business gon' explode
Have to re-show for sure your bitch told

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
What it is, hoe?
Or wassup?
Can a nigga get up in them guts?
Fuck it up like you ain't been fucked
Bust it open, let my niggas get a nut

[Bridge: Freddie Gibbs]
Girl, I know you want to fuck some, fuck some
Girl, you know I want to fuck some, fuck some
Girl, I know you want to fuck some, fuck some
Girl, you know I want to fuck some, fuck some
What it is, ho?

[Outro: IamSu! & (Voices)]
She want me to hit it but I don't got no protection
Switching all my swagger, hit her with the tiger
Ride the D, she gotta climb up on the ladder
(God damn!
"Let's get it on."
"Who are these guys?"
"It's my theme music.  Every good hero should have some.")
