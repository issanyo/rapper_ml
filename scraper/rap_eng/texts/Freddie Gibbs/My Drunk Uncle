I said hey, I come in the house, I come in the house
My nephew steal all my legs, he steal, all better, Freddie Gibbs
He steal all the shit in my house
(unintelligible)... on the microphone
He took everythang from me
You know what I'm sayin'?
I say hey, he took everythang from me
Big Time Watts in the house
I say hey
(unintelligible)... I'm livin' life
And it's the truth on the microphone
He took everythang from me
He took everythang

[Freddie Gibbs]
Ugh, yeah
