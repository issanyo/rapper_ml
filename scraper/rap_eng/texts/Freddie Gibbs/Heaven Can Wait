[Verse 1]
24 hours to live, what would you do?
Just get high, treat everyday like my birthday, smoke with the crew
Hit the hood cause you know bitches be thirsty for dudes with loot
I change the paint to money green on my Cutlass
Rumble the roof like it was reinvented
Where the freaks is?
Whats a drop if ain't no bitches in it?
Ride with me today, I'm in a mood to go spend some spinach
On my niggas of course
Funny how we straight from section 8, now we chill in resorts
30, 40 deep on south beach, me and D-Edge
Brought some bitches with us, but fuck these Puerto Ricans instead
Do this for my people, hopefully I can leave them some bread
Before these punk polices or jealous streets leave me for dead
I live a wild life, some might say it's child-like
On my second childhood
Bubba kush, banana wood, sippin on some purple fluid
These drugs will kill me before I let you do it
187 Proof, I die today, I live through this music, Gibbs

[Hook] x2
Before I check out, let me diamond my neck out
Blow a mil on my niggas, fuck bitches like I was fresh out
Fresh to death when I step out, every day approaching the gates
I live a helluva life, baby, heaven can wait

Heaven can wait

[Verse 2]
Everyday I pray to be as strong as Huey Newton
Before you pull that trigger, take a closer look at who you shooting
Mirror image, nothing different, you just another slave
Tryin to succeed in these European's narcotics trade
Worked all week, 140 dollars was all I made
Fuck a job, I'd rather chop a rock and be chopping blades
Gotta watch these cops cause I came too far to die in a cage
Watch who you fuck, rather catch a bullet than die from AIDS
Before I check out, let me diamond my neck out
Crushing feelings on Broadway, I pulled that Monte SS out
Buy my mom a new spot and make sure that bitch super decked out
Swear I can't leave this Earth 'til I'm sure that you never stress out
Before I left out
I grab the zip and extra clips and hit the L on 21st and Virginia, and bless the Fifth
Hit the lab so I can lay all the shit I didn't get to spit
Could die tonight, but what I write they forever gon' reminisce
It's Gangsta Gibbs
