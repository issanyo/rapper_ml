[Verse 1: Nick Grant]
Uhh, set the ambiance
Nothin' to somethin', we made it out of it
Mink drag the floor, tell PETA peep the exoticness
I see you rappers energy funny, that's politics
I love 'em all, bitches wall to wall like a hieroglyph
Summer bodies take all spring
I tell her swallow it, game
Don't be a lost fling, come live out your dreams (DREAMS!!!)
Used to sleep on floors, now we ride in Ghost
Ouija board, cherry oak
Sweet decor, boy, your life is CB4, clean
Kiss ring, big bling since 16 (Uh huh)
Sweet, think it's a game 'til ya shit get split screen (Uh huh)
Can I dream of fly cars, hoes with two degrees?
Just know when you the king, jealous eyes float the scene
Vintage pea coat
Nigga flowin' like he could've been the king of each coast (Baby, baby!)
I'm the Carter Nino (What?)
If I'm ever in a jam, best believe I squeeze toast
All black whip, bitch
You best believe that he woke, this is heaven

[Chorus: VanJess]
Isn't it funny now that we runnin'
That we in heaven so far from home
Don't worry for me, just get your own
Dose of heaven (Of heaven)
Isn't it funny now that we runnin'
That we in heaven so far from home
Don't worry for me, just get your own
Dose of heaven (Of heaven)

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Kane train, I move the Mussolini, Muslanne
Bentley thing, no monkey diamonds, Rollie plain Jane
Bustin' plays, my momma kick me out, I serve J's
Underage, I seen 'em chop that work in 3rd grade
Sugar Hill Romello, 'Rari canary yellow
Hit your bitch in a Bugatta singin' in a falsetto
Put a lock on your lady, my ex-bitches, they hate me
But can't replace me ('cause there's no better love)
Yeah, I feel like Luther when I'm with my [?]
German engineerin', I don't even gotta steer it
Used to rock the dope, but now they drop the dough for my appearance
[?] pick me up, but warrin' in the [?] with my parents
I'm the fuckin' heir apparent, grippin' on another level
Baby face the don, get on my level, bitch or get a shuttle
Homies tried to sting me, know these pussy niggas hate me
But can't replace me ('cause there's no better love)

[Chorus: VanJess]
Isn't it funny now that we runnin'
That we in heaven so far from home
Don't worry for me, just get your own
Dose of heaven (Of heaven)
Isn't it funny now that we runnin'
That we in heaven so far from home
Don't worry for me, just get your own
Dose of heaven (Of heaven)
