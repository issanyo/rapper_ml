[Verse 1]
Pour one up, court ain't showing up, fucked the warrant up
Lawyered up, got my Cohens up, is you gon' fuck or what
Foreign'd up, Benzy buttoned up, Chevy buttoned up
Ride with the dope, clicked up in the Tesla truck, is you gon' fuck or what?
Fuck or what? Just left London, smokin' something, sold out event, yeah
Used to ride on 41 with two and a split, yeah
Drop the dope in Terre Haute, get throat from your bitch, yeah
Ballin' on your campus like I'm a scholarship, yeah
Got straight to the funds, I was one and done
Trade these hoes like Kyrie, I'm LeBron, mafioso don
Shout out to Diego, my day one, we done copped a ton
Left her house soon as I saw the sun, I was one and done

[Chorus]
Bitch, yeah
Ain't no whippin' what I'm chippin', straight off the brick, yeah
Arm and Hammer with the chicken, I'm too legit, yeah
Ain't no whippin' what I'm chippin', straight off the brick, yeah
Arm and Hammer with the chicken, I'm too legit, yeah
Ain't no whippin' what I'm chippin', straight off the brick, yeah
Arm and Hammer with the chicken, I'm too legit, yeah
Ain't no whippin' what I'm chippin', straight off the brick, yeah
Arm and Hammer with the chicken, I'm too legit, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm too legit, yeah
Just copped that new GTR-uh, I'm super lit, yeah
I'm super lit, yeah, too lit to quit, yeah
She wanna wrap it and package it, I'm like shit yeah, bitch yeah
I got my first paycheck, quit my job, let's get some yay today
My money in the struggle, had to put my shit on layaway
Once they got a taste of that white flake, boy they couldn't stay away
Emptied out my 45, hit em with that MJ fade away (swish)
Fresh up off a thang, it's young Freddie Kane
Gangsta ain't not snitchin' on my name, that's on Mary Jane
9, 22, 1 deuce, bitch I'm insane, put that on the gang
AK hit you with that yoga flame, won't stay in your lane

[Chorus]
Bitch, yeah
Ain't no whippin' what I'm chippin', straight off the brick, yeah
Arm and Hammer with the chicken, I'm too legit, yeah
Ain't no whippin' what I'm chippin', straight off the brick, yeah
Arm and Hammer with the chicken, I'm too legit, yeah
Ain't no whippin' what I'm chippin', straight off the brick, yeah
Arm and Hammer with the chicken, I'm too legit, yeah
Ain't no whippin' what I'm chippin', straight off the brick, yeah
Arm and Hammer with the chicken, I'm too legit, yeah
