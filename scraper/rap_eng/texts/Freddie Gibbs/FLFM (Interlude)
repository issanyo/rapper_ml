[Intro]
Feelin' like fuckin' me
Feelin' like fuckin' me

[Verse]
Been checkin' you for so long, and I feel (feel)
Girl you should let me know, what the deal (deal)
Peepin' out your vibe (vibe)
And if you wanna let me slide (slide)
So what you need to do right now, is keep it real
I know you want me home just like, I want you (I want you)
So stop frontin' like you don't, when you do (do)
And if you feelin' naughty, naughty
If you really 'bout it, 'bout it
And if you get me rowdy, rowdy
My love will make you shout it, shout it

Feelin' like lovin' me
Feelin' like kissin' me
Feelin' like suckin' me
Oh, you're feelin' like fuckin' me

Fuck up
Come and give me some pussy
Bg cat, watch
