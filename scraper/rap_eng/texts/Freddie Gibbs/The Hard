[Intro: Dana Williams]
I know that life is short
But we can't move too fast

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Hit the block, dressed in white, straight Bo Jackson Nikes
Call my partner Mike, copped a pint, pour four in my Sprite
55 a line, that's aight cause I'm 'bout that life
Pussy on my mind, bitch you tired, it's that mouth tonight
Weed and waffles in the morning
Downtown Chicago, smoking on some shit that I imported
MDMA light up her day, sometimes she like to snort it
And shit was too dry with that Tony, bitch now I'm reloaded
Bitch I'm reloaded
And I'm chopping up the hard, dopeboy I play my part
Fuck with the gangsta type, ain't got no stripes, then you's a mark
Smoking Carolina Blue fresh out the Carolina Park
So much gunplay in the day, just might be safer in the dark
And this Glock ain't got no safety, the owner ain't got no patience
So please don't make my finger and this trigger make relations
Said this Glock ain't got no safety, straight make yo ass a patient
Guess I'll slang until my grave or take that federal vacation
Nigga, nigga

[Pre-Hook: Dana Williams]
I know that life is short
But we can't move too fast

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
These niggas want it so I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard
These niggas say they want it so I'm chopping up the hard
Said I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard
These geekers say they on it so I'm chopping up the hard, nigga

[Bridge: Freddie Gibbs]
Whip the crack, dressed in black, just picked up a pack
Feeling great, dropped some 28s, got 'em jumping back
Jumping up, what the fuck, G.I. they don't fuck with us
Most these niggas out the Mid wouldn't breathe until I bust a nut

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Rob a nigga father figure, dope house was my college nigga
Plus my part time job didn't make no dollars, I'm a water whipper
See through you like windows, basis of your heart is artificial
Mob of hungry niggas like we came straight out of Mogadishu
What's the issue? Stack full of pancakes and my pistol
Shit official, when you see a police, nigga hit that whistle
They out to get you, so fuck all my opponents
They can peel me off this corner cause I know these niggas want it

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
These niggas want it so I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard
These niggas say they want it so I'm chopping up the hard
Said I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard
These geekers say they on it so I'm chopping up the hard, nigga

[Verse 3: Dana]
I know that life is short
(Life's short, know what I'm saying, you gotta get moving, know what I mean)
But we can't move too fast
(Know what I'm saying, I ain't tryna run a race or no shit like that, you know)
Cause if we go right now
(Nigga just tryna get out here and chop, chop it up and get mine, you know
Piece of the pie)
It will never last
In the morning
When the sun comes up
And everything is cold
It's a new day
And all of it is beautiful
Or so I thought

[Freddie Gibbs]
Just let me make it to another morning
Just let me make it to another morning
Just let me make it to another morning
Just let me make it to another morning

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
These niggas want it so I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard
These niggas say they want it so I'm chopping up the hard
Said I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard
These geekers say they on it so I'm chopping up the hard, nigga
