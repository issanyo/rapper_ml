Yeah, yeah, I'm high upon a new wave of confidence
I'm trying to ride it to a few different continents
Known in the country that I'm from but anonymous
To most of the populous and dominant
Awkward places, I'm from New Zealand and I'm use to seeing different faces
And they don't ever turn the radio to different stations
I gotta do it though cause Mum's getting sick of waiting
When I was young she used to tell me "Have some f*cking patience"
But she loved the baby boy, raise the bar like I'm on roids with my game playing with the joysticks
I'm grateful for the voice I've been given
Big boy now my purple whip about to have all of the sort of bugs flicking
Sippin' vodka soda with the twist in
I don't say it should be different it's still hip hop in the vein
Smurnoff in the brain, always been a cool dude I'll let you know if you can say
I'm kicking back feeling good on a Friday
Ain't letting all the bullshit get in my way
Know that I stay caught in a daze
Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze
You don't mess in my heart, things are looking up
You can see in my eyes, so you know I'm
Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze
Picture caught up in the day, holdup with these police again
And these vehicles we
That's why they hate
Custom colors is my
In up on 60's
If you ever trying to find my I'd probably be
With me
Open up baggy stuff like muffins
Out of dope enjoy your crisis ain't in my buddy so f*ck it
I stuck em up and got on the highway, ready
Get fried like everyday is Friday
In the place I reside I keep that iron cause them goons gonna be lurking
Keep my dough spot popping in my
Put me on a licking anybody move I'm a murk them knock them off their shoes and get their ass to
That's for certain bitch
You flirting with death if you f*ck of mine
Shit you walk up and take your life in this life of crime
In this life of mine I took recent put my life on a line
Agents ask me for a statement I decline
I'm kicking back feeling good on a Friday
And let me know the bullshit get in my way
Know that I stay caught in a daze
Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze
You don't mess in my heart, things are looking up
You can see in my eyes, so you know I'm
Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze
It's all they can never
Down, deeply rooted in the ground
Way I spit it's so profound, know the sound like some shit you heard before
But it ain't everyone's a
Now but I'm using different paint man
I'm using different egg for the story, this is guts this is glory
It's the rush of performing it's the slut when you're horny
It's the feeling that you get when you wake up in the morning
All that feeling that you get when the sun's dawning on another day
And you ain't seen your life another way
Working at the same job for next to nothing pay
Plugging away it's the dreams trying to hold this shit together
While the worst tuck in away, the same sick
Struggling it ain't no fame, one you looking back
But f*ck if you ever
Try to
From that
So why you see it like a vintage car
You put your all in your writing, I once
You can rise
You talk about it with your friends as a symbol of a hard work
This is all of me sewing there looking that doing lenses
It's probably right
And my voice is so committed
I'm kicking back feeling good on a Friday
And let me know the bullshit get in my way
Know that I stay caught in a daze
Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze
You don't mess in my heart, things are looking up
You can see in my eyes, so you know I'm
Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze
