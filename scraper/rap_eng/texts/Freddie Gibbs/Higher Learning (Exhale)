We smoking like its legal, give a damn where the cops at, stank up the ride

All rise, the almighty father open my eyes
It was June fourteenth, one nine nine five
My thirteenth birthday I met this dame
Drove my boys insane, Mary Jane was her name
First girl to steal my heart with one kiss
Got me tricking off chips to kick it with this bitch
And she always told me she’d love me for life
I now pronounce You man and wife
Mary Mary girl, I need ya
I just want a piece of
Sticky, stanky, chunky, country, hunky, funky reefer
Ease my
Mind for the second, the minute, maybe the hour
Freddie cougar kushie monster
Killa shit I devour
Toking that Okinawa, that Purple Urkle, that Master
Go through a nigga personal stash turned into ashes
I’m outer space above the clouds I’m telling you why
Smoking tweeds is a hell of a high
Its a hell of a high
(So high)
Yeah, fasho
Smoking tweeds is a hell of a high
(So high)
Niggas been drinking that wine, smoking them tweeds
(so high)
Cut the lights out in this motherfucker
(I’m so high)
He on a helluva high
Helluva high
