[Hook - Pharrell]
You should be only interested in those who put you on the G
You can hang out with them haters or you can hang out with me
Shawty tell 'em if you can't break it down from A to Z
Hey I'm on a little diet, gotta stay hater free
You got to go (higher!)

[Verse 1 - Freddie Gibbs]
Talking reckless, but I ate that thang for breakfast
And Iâ€™m ready keep on that ring left on my Nikes and my necklace
Ain't no hickies on this sticky, keeping shit secret when we sexing
Go to GI bout my BI rolling in the new 650 flexin
Talking about some top with the top down, what you talk?
Hot sex, champagne all night
You ain't 'bout that life, baby keep on walking
I sweat the weave out
Girl you know the play before we leave out
Cuddle up, double up take them to the suite
Finna show these hoes what this cheese about, Gangsta Gibbs

[Bridge]
Maybe she will or she won't
Maybe she do what she don't
Cause we be on the pimp shit
You can get your bitch flipped, I just wanna hit, get ghost
Shots to the head, let's toast, twist up the flame
Pledge allegiance to the realest niggas getting it in this game
Serving thangs, made my motherfucking name
Gangsta Gibbs

[Verse 2 - Freddie Gibbs]
Right back in her, and I ate that thang for dinner
And I Chi-town ride in the summertime, on the West Coast in the winter
Man, I fucking left her fiending, dog, it was so cold how I did her
Claim she hate my guts but she always gon' be right there when I hit her
Talking about some top on the top floor, what you talk
Hot sex, champagne all night
You about 'bout that life baby keep on walking
I fucks with white girls
Puerto Rican, Asian, I hope you like girls
Got a whole pound and broke some more down
Cuz you gettin' tore down tonight girl
Gangsta Gibbs
