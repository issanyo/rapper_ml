[Verse 1]
I was born in small town with big dreams
Pops told me as a child I would do big things
Used to watch him in the mirror when he used to rehearse
Hella talented but talent wasn’t makin’ no merch
Another product of that Gary, Indiana
Sex, drugs, and murder
Dirty politicians, dirty police, dirty burners
On the streets as a worker
Was a very fast learner
School never taught me how to be a earner
Before you mothafuckers bother me just take a look at this economy
Cause economically we at the bottom
So playa hatin’ niggas copy me
My enemies they tried to body me
But couldn’t get to me before I got ‘em
A motherfuckin’ problem
Gangster Gibbs
When I do it do it big
Put it down for the crib
Rap shit to totin’ that gat shit
And it’s plain to see
That it ain’t no changin’ me

[HOOK]
I’m comin’ live from the
G, A-R-Y
Good or bad, right or wrong
Where the young boys die
No mercy, no pity in my city and it’s plain to see
That it ain’t no changin’ me
Nigga I’m fresh up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
I’m straight up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
I said I’m fresh up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
Nigga I’m straight up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)

[Verse 2]
I’m comin’ live from the
G, A-R-Y
Good or bad, right or wrong
Where the young boys die
No mercy, no pity, not a tear in my eye
Why cry, I’mma blaze another blunt n’ get high
Look in the sky, blow the smoke to my niggas
Pray to God for forgiveness
Yes I’m sinnin’ but I’m winnin’ and it’s bidness on you bitches
You can go against my wishes and put a stop on my riches
Then my peeps leave you sleep in Lake Michigan with the fishes
Niggas think that it’s fictitious till they hear that ratta-tatta
Niggas scatter
Even senior citizens tote the hammer
Thought that Gary, Indiana was movin’ on up the ladder
But I guess it didn’t matter when the crackers got sick’a Hatcher
They turn their back to us
Introduce crack to us
Got you ridin’ with that iron in that black Buick
I been through it, you can feel it in my music
Cook it up and move it
This is how we do it

[HOOK]
I’m comin’ live from the
G, A-R-Y
Good or bad, right or wrong
Where the young boys die
No mercy, no pity in my city and it’s plain to see
That it ain’t no changin’ me
Nigga I’m fresh up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
I’m straight up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
I said I’m fresh up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
Nigga I’m straight up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)

[Verse 3]
Nigga I represent the East side
7-tier GBT town
Riff block, valley boy
Nigga catch a beat down
Midtown, Marshalltown, Avignon, Goldmiller
GV Concord
Bronx niggas real killas
Etna to Ironwood, full of crazy niggas
Shady niggas, can’t forget ‘bout my Delaney niggas
And all my homies through the streets of the G
I’m gonna let the streets speak though me
It’s for them cats pushin’ packs in the hallway
Doin’ it the hard way
Posted on the corner like liquor stores on Broadway
Watchin’ for the jackals keep ‘em clappin for the gunplay
Live for the day
Motherfuck what a nigga say
I’m just showin’ off my GI pride
Anywhere the kid go, you know GI ride
So I dedicate this record to my GI thugs
And I bleed the same GI blood

[HOOK]
I’m comin’ live from the
G, A-R-Y
Good or bad, right or wrong
Where the young boys die
No mercy, no pity in my city and it’s plain to see
That it ain’t no changin’ me
Nigga I’m fresh up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
I’m straight up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
I said I’m fresh up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
Nigga I’m straight up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
