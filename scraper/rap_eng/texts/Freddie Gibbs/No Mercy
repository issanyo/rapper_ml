[Verse 1: Illa Ghee]
Throw your shit up
Trucks, pick up, kicks up dust
The same shit we stuck clicks up for
Snub hit up more, peach cores
Count one for my side
It's like we're keeping score
You're lying down when the lion roars, and soars
When you breathe no more
A civil talk is now a civil war
Licking shots while you're coming out the liqour store
You bought a round but we're tossing rounds
And get the pigs that put a stencil with the chalk around
We confront the bullshit like we're talking now
You the type to get tough when we walking out (clowns)
Your boss man, yeah we boss around
Fresh off tour, back home and tore it down
Yeah I do music
But trust I'm not here for your fucking amusement
Go
I don't deal with ridicule, bullets riddle you
You knocked out yous tennis shoes at a minimal
Fuck an interview, I question a criminal
Fresh start in my eyes
Is ending you

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs & Switch]
[Gibbs] I spit bullets of mercury
[Switch] No heart, no love, no mercy
[Gibbs] You die if you thought of rap perjury
[Switch] No heart, no love, no mercy
[x2]
No mercy
No love no mercy

[Verse 2: Illa Ghee]
I grab a sharp lyric to stab with, I mass it
I'm an avalanche in an ad-lib
Act like I'm jumping out of cabs with mad kids
With masks kids, pulling out nines to blast shit
I put your favorite rapper in a casket
See I'm like a rash on chapsticks
Fronting on the city driving backwards
Words and tracks, relax Illa's orchestrated elastic
My souls drowning in the bottle
Today is really yesterday's tomorrow
My time is borrowed
No a Bugatti, I think I woke up in a gangster's sorrow
Spitting fire and my teeth is all made of charcoal
I make music that the heart holds
Verbal Armani, Illuminati in the barcode
Drink, weed, and I'm sleeping with a known disease
I'm Al Capone, and I'm known as an assassin's creed
Cross Ill and that's blasphemy
I got a whole neighborhood that'll blast for me
Flow jacuzzi, I'm Jack Ruby insanity
Cocking my three blending uzis in the Daiquiris

[Hook]
