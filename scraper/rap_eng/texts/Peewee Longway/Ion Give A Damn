[Hook]
My bitch say I got bad habits, I don't give a damn
Cookin' dope I'm back at it, I don't give a damn
Servin' nothin but crack addicts, I don't give a damn
Bitches say I'm bad habits, pull up in a Lamb

[Verse 1]
Serve it to whoever want it, I don't give a damn
Come in smellin' like Marijuana, cause I don't give a damn
Stuff crustin' it cause I'm a stoner,  cause I don't give a damn
Set up shop put work on your corner, cause I don't give a damn
You lookin' at a nigga don't give a damn
Walkin' with two pistols, double down
Fuck with the mailman work it around
Place your order, drop it in your town
Drivin' the lamb all you hear is vroom
Makin a movie no billy boom
Coupe X rated, Houdini roof
Had the coupe blue
Who give a damn if you mad at me
In the pot I'm whippin' up that Jason Jeter
Fuckin' with the migos get quesadillas
It's a butler beeper, done deal
R.I.P. [?]
Versace my feet to my ears
Your not me, hard to be cloned
Versace sprayed on cologne
So damn piped up, I don't give a damn
My bitch bald head buy her earrings from [?]
Turned the fuck up, turn the fuck where

[Hook]
My bitch say I got bad habits, I don't give a damn
Cookin' dope I'm back at it, I don't give a damn
Servin' nothin but crack addicts, I don't give a damn
Bitches say I'm bad habits, pull up in a Lamb

[Verse 2]
I never gave a damn, I never gave a fuck
Hit yo town like Katrina struck
Got og reefer low as fuck
Now who want it, I'm servin' niggas
Buyin' niggas spendin'
Playin' with money, ask around who killed kenny
Who gunnin? MPA, rollin' round with me
Got them drums, we comin' [?]
Since I had a lesson I never gave a shit bitch
Missing your blessing, you missin' out on dick, I'm the shit bitch
Watch me drop a block and throw a brick
Smell it I got pounds of OG
Double R rich Rolls
In the Phantom, dirtying up the Fanta
Dope boy mouth full of golds
Don't give a fuck, ride with two .44's
Longway


[Hook]
My bitch say I got bad habits, I don't give a damn
Cookin' dope I'm back at it, I don't give a damn
Servin' nothin but crack addicts, I don't give a damn
Bitches say I'm bad habits, pull up in a Lamb

[Outro]
Serve it to whoever want it, I don't give a damn
Come in smellin' like Marijuana, cause I don't give a damn
Stuff crustin' it cause I'm a stoner,  cause I don't give a damn
Set up shop put work on your corner, cause I don't give a damn
