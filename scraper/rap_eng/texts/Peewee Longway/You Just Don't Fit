[Pre-Chorus]
It ain’t my fault you ain’t got a ounce of bone in your body
Who the hell is you, you are not nobody
Rocking the same Jordan but my mine flawless
Jet cause your round a million dollar
Throughout the bullshits still smoking not a problem
Money coming keep coming in, niggas still hatin’
Put the bible on the bench and the fucking AK

[Chorus]
You just don’t fit the criteria, you just don’t fit the criteria
You just don’t fit the criteria
Your money keep coming in and nigga hatin’
You just don’t fit the criteria, you just don’t fit the criteria
You just don’t fit the criteria
Your money keep coming in and nigga hatin’

[Pre-Chorus]
It ain’t my fault you ain’t got a ounce of bone in your body
Who the hell is you, you are no nobody
Rocking the same Jordan but my mine flawless
Jet cause your round a million dollar
Throughout the bullshits still smoking not a problem
Money coming keep coming in, niggas still hatin’
Put the bible on the bench and the fucking AK

[Chorus]
You just don’t fit the criteria, you just don’t fit the criteria
You just don’t fit the criteria
Your money keep coming in and nigga hatin’
You just don’t fit the criteria, you just don’t fit the criteria
You just don’t fit the criteria
Your money keep coming in and nigga hatin’

[Verse 1]
More money, more money, more problems and haters
Pussy nigga, imma check they paper
Flipping them package and reel 'em up, I'm dedicated
Treppin' and deppin' [?]
Only the strong  survive and the [?] trap out the beacon
Follow my GPS, call on y'all for gazing
Niggas ain’t fit the criteria, what they say they make
Got the [?] in the real estate, treppin' at the super 8
All you bitches want Don Juan in the air
Cating you bossing, be coming here in front of bae
You don’t fit the criteria me calling you bae
Ball man hanging on hand, super fit
Imma turn it down with 'em Vance and the trench
Imma pull her with dolla tab on the Bentley
All we did dropping at rear of Mr. Bentley
Front you choose to worry, clear me on the building
Longway bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
It ain’t my fault you ain’t got a ounce of bone in your body
Who the hell is you, you are not nobody
Rocking the same Jordan but my mine flawless
Jet cause your round a million dollar
Throughout the bullshits still smoking not a problem
Money coming keep coming in, niggas still hatin’
Put the bible on the bench and the fucking AK

[Chorus]
You just don’t fit the criteria, you just don’t fit the criteria
You just don’t fit the criteria
Your money keep coming in and nigga hatin’
You just don’t fit the criteria, you just don’t fit the criteria
You just don’t fit the criteria
Your money keep coming in and nigga hatin’

[Verse 3]
Fuck a pussy then get a sudden hate
4 5 in the clip get a sudden take
Driving Blue Benjamin over turn a nigga straight
Knock on the [?] when I run up on the way
Niggas snitching in the front 48
Pussy nigga [?] fuck nigga trait
Put slows in his head bust shot in his face
Are you feeling me now
[?]
I’m burning my new image, Mr. Blue Benjamin now
Still chirping on [?] while you just wanna be down
Dropping the ticket I’m way the talk of the town
Remy the jeweler got nowhere with the ruler
[?]
Got your bitch taking a day, all advantage rule
Rich nigga make your bitch break rules, Longway bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
It ain’t my fault you ain’t got a ounce of bone in your body
Who the hell is you, you are not nobody
Rocking the same Jordan but my mine flawless
Jet cause your round a million dollar
Throughout the bullshits still smoking not a problem
Money coming keep coming in, niggas still hatin’
Put the bible on the bench and the fucking AK

[Chorus]
You just don’t fit the criteria, you just don’t fit the criteria
You just don’t fit the criteria
Your money keep coming in and nigga hatin’
You just don’t fit the criteria, you just don’t fit the criteria
You just don’t fit the criteria
Your money keep coming in and nigga hatin’

[Pre-Chorus]
It ain’t my fault you ain’t got a ounce of bone in your body
Who the hell is you, you are not nobody
Rocking the same Jordan but my mine flawless
Jet cause your round a million dollar
Throughout the bullshits still smoking not a problem
Money coming keep coming in, niggas still hatin’
Put the bible on the bench and the fucking AK

[Chorus]
You just don’t fit the criteria, you just don’t fit the criteria
You just don’t fit the criteria
Your money keep coming in and nigga hatin’
You just don’t fit the criteria, you just don’t fit the criteria
You just don’t fit the criteria
Your money keep coming in and nigga hatin’
