[Intro]
Longway blues, nigga
Huh, we got the blues, the BB King way
The CC King way
Huh, sittin' on top of the bank, nigga

[Chorus]
Sittin' on top of the bank
Watchin' the time roll away
I left my home in Georgia (In Georgia, yeah)
Headed for the 'Frisco Bay (The 'Frisco Bay)
We come for the weight, four forty-eights (We come for the weight)
We come for the weight, four forty-eights (We come for the weight)
From the safe to the Wraith, put that bitch back in play
Yeah, she just wanna fuck me too-ooh-ooh
She just wanna suck me too-ooh-ooh
She just wanna fuck me too-ooh-ooh
She just wanna suck me too-ooh-ooh
She just wanna fuck me too-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Longway Gnarls Barkley
Trap in my Charles Barkleys
Went through them Bob Barkers
Now we at Bill Harper
See through my Gucci goggles
Four-four-eight role model
Yes sir, she gon' swallow
Superhead her role model
I wish you would've jumped on the way
Watchin' the time roll away, too late
I left my home in Georgia (In Georgia, yeah)
Headed for the 'Frisco Bay (The 'Frisco Bay)
Dark shades on like I'm Stevie today
I don't wanna see it, let me feel it like Ray
Diamonds on my neck, they LED, they Bluray
From the safe to the Wraith, put that bitch back in play
Longway, bitch

[Chorus]
Sittin' on top of the bank
Watchin' the time roll away
I left my home in Georgia (In Georgia, yeah)
Headed for the 'Frisco Bay (The 'Frisco Bay)
We come for the weight, four forty-eights (We come for the weight)
We come for the weight, four forty-eights (We come for the weight)
From the safe to the Wraith, put that bitch back in play
Yeah, she just wanna fuck me too-ooh-ooh
She just wanna suck me too-ooh-ooh
She just wanna fuck me too-ooh-ooh
She just wanna suck me too-ooh-ooh
She just wanna fuck me too-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Three-one on my stomach
EB in my date dial (Ice)
Longway, boy got two styles
She wanna fuck my PayPal
She wanna suck me too-ooh-ooh
She wanna suck me loose
Sittin' on the bank, I'm cool-ooh-ooh
Now she wanna call me boo
Jimmy Choo, Jet Leathers, and my peacock Rollie blue
Trap house back in Georgia sell a hundred on the cool
Left my home in Georgia (In Georgia, yeah)
Foreign back to back, we with Ferrari peekaboo
Leave the lot smellin' like some damn dumpster juice
Everybody got that shit on, everybody countin' them blues
BB King, CC King, neighborhoods en route
.223, N16, extendo, ain't gon' snooze, Longway, bitch

[Chorus]
Sittin' on top of the bank
Watchin' the time roll away
I left my home in Georgia (In Georgia, yeah)
Headed for the 'Frisco Bay (The 'Frisco Bay)
We come for the weight, four forty-eights (We come for the weight)
We come for the weight, four forty-eights (We come for the weight)
From the safe to the Wraith, put that bitch back in play
Yeah, she just wanna fuck me too-ooh-ooh
She just wanna suck me too-ooh-ooh
She just wanna fuck me too-ooh-ooh
She just wanna suck me too-ooh-ooh
She just wanna fuck me too-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
Long live CC King
I do this shit for the old and the young, man
And the in-between, you understand me?
Got the blues, man
Swagged out, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Longway CC King
