[Intro: Peewee Longway]
Long (I'm on that bullshit)
Longway, Longway
Guillotine, what it do, nigga?
Fuck nigga shit
In Tune, what it do, nigga?
Longway Longway, bitch

[Chorus: Peewee Longway]
Lookin' to the left and my left wrist flooded
Lookin' to the right and your whole clique dirty
Tryna start a fight and my whole clique thuggin'
Shoot 'em up, bang bang, shoot 'em, bang
Whole clique gangbang, throwin' up the same thing
Shoot 'em up, bang bang, shoot 'em, bang
Hundred-fifty for a chain, youngin thirsty for a stain
Shoot 'em up, bang bang, shoot 'em, bang

[Verse 1: Peewee Longway]
Dark black Cartiers like I'm Johnny Cage (Longway Johnny Cage)
Thuggin' in the mosh-pit, all we do is rage
Chopper got some dumb kick, spray 'em like some Raid
Pocket look like phonebook, blue, yellow page
Diamonds look like lasers when I'm jumpin' on the stage (HD)
I was super faded when I interviewed with Fader (Hella geeked)
Got some lightning babies, all they need is jumper cables
Trap nominated, I was sellin' bales of sage (Trap, trap)
Lookin' to my right, I see a clique full of fugazi (Fufu ass niggas)
Rock pasta, I sell a brick in Palm Angels
Top shotta, Wayne Wayne
Know some thirsty niggas, they go gremlin for your chain
When we bite, bitch, we put venom in your vein
I got homies in the chain gang, say sinnin' ain't a thing
Once you spin it one time, better spin it once again
Got the Glock-45 with the fifty on the end
In the '63 coupe with the stick inside the Benz
That's a hundred more shots, call forensic in this bitch
When it's fresh up out the doc, them bricks like dentals in this bitch
I been known my face good, I use credentials on the shit
I'm a trapper turned rapper and I used to hit licks
When I'm goin' for the sack, I'ma use the hit stick
When I'm thuggin' with the MAC, I trick-or-treat like Bushwick
I make slaps just like I'm Fabo, wake up on that bullshit
Longway, bitch

[Chorus: Peewee Longway]
Lookin' to the left and my left wrist flooded
Lookin' to the right and your whole clique dirty
Tryna start a fight and my whole clique thuggin'
Shoot 'em up, bang bang, shoot 'em, bang
Whole clique gangbang, throwin' up the same thing
Shoot 'em up, bang bang, shoot 'em, bang
Hundred-fifty for a chain, youngin thirsty for a stain
Shoot 'em up, bang bang, shoot 'em, bang

[Verse 2: Young Nudy]
All I do is gangbang, bloods 'round me
Nigga play with slime, leave him bloody in the street
I don't do that talkin' when it come to the beef
You know I'm from the East Side, I'm so PDE
I pull up on them niggas, catch 'em on the front street
Catch your ass while you eatin', then I shoot through your teeth
I ain't with that talkin', need to hush your mouth
Have them gangsters pull up, shoot your mama house up
Y'all niggas talkin', y'all be doin' a lot of that
Doin' a lot of that, I know y'all niggas really rats
Pull up in the 'Cat, you know a cat gon' eat a rat (Yeah)
All that snitchin' shit, you know we puttin' an end to that (You know that)
That tough shit, you know we get rid of that
You were real gangster like a minute ago
Pulled up on you, you ain't gangster no more
Now you wanna be friendly, but we shootin' at your door, huh
Anyway, that the end of that
Pull up where them niggas at, they don't want none of that
All that kickback shit, we shootin' up all of that
They must ain't told you, man, you beefin' with a grown man
I don't play, dawg, shit get real
Call of Duty guns when I'm in the field
And I paid niggas, pull up just to kill
Hah, ayy, I got money nigga (I got it)

[Chorus: Peewee Longway]
Lookin' to the left and my left wrist flooded
Lookin' to the right and your whole clique dirty
Tryna start a fight and my whole clique thuggin'
Shoot 'em up, bang bang, shoot 'em, bang
Whole clique gangbang, throwin' up the same thing
Shoot 'em up, bang bang, shoot 'em, bang
Hundred-fifty for a chain, youngin thirsty for a stain
Shoot 'em up, bang bang, shoot 'em, bang
