On with that shit my nigga, on with that shit

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
We ain’t got nothing else to talk about
Dust off that choppa, lets shoot it out
We ain’t got nothing else to talk about
Put a bag on ya head four cutie pies
We ain’t got nothing else to talk about
Molly keep that bitch occupied
On with that shit gon let it ride
Boyz N Da Hood, gonna catch em down bad
Shoot em in the back like ricky
Pull up to the trap got snipers on the roof
Gon hit his ass down on business
You gone fuck around get your shooter shot
Face on the milk cart missin’
Knife on the choppa poke em like the penitentary
Hit a whole hundred in a minute

[Verse 1: PeeWee LongWay]
I guess its bout that time a nigga start killin’
Nigga did a whole lotta dealin’
Egg Beater beat the pocket like Rocky Balboa
Mr. Blue Benjamin stack it up like Boston George
Boys in the hood trap them bags on the porch
Balenciaga, my momma said keep that pistol
Puss ass nigga hit his ass in the kisser
Dress him up and put him in a strap Bruce Jenner
I ain’t got that type of comin’ out the kennel
I’m let my little homie eat you up for dinner
Calaso mob ties with real mob ass niggas
Catch him in the alley gun him down like Ricky
Bonnets on his head hit em with the dick my nigga
From the other side playing with the chop in the trenches
I had to dust it off these niggas out here whisperin’
Reverse the clip hit a hundred in a minute

Sent some through they can change up your image
Four cuties that will get’ em out his feelings
I gotta dope tester, trigger finger itchin’
Put a rocket on a shooter he get a sniper vision
Keep a hammer on my hip like I’m Bob the Builder
Makin’ Juugs outta bitch like a body builder
I’m a grown man y’all all children
Got em' finding your body like I’m Wayne Williams

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
On with that shit my nigga, on with that shit
We ain’t got nothing else to talk about
Thats why let the choppa shoot it out
We ain’t got nothing else to talk about
Put a bag on ya head for a cutie pie
We ain’t got nothing else to talk about
Molly keep that bitch occupied
On with that shit gon let it ride
Boyz N Da Hood, gonna catch em down bad
Shoot em in the back like Ricky
Pull up to the trap got snipers on the roof
Gon hit his ass down on business (pew-pew)
You gone fuck around get your shooter shot
Face on the milk cart missin’
Knife on the choppa poke em like the penitentary
Hit a whole hundred in a minute


[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Dirty Chopper came with homicides
Full of bodies, fuck it, still shoot it
Snipers in my trunk on top of the roof
Whip up a brick, watch me turn it to two
I’m with the bullshit, fuck your crew
Pour my Tuss in Double Cups
Dressed up in blue with the tommy gun
Handgun came with a Cinnabon
We ain’t got none else to talk about
Got GPS Bullets gone find yo location
Hop out and pop it they dreaded like Haitians
Put a curfew on your block like I’m on probation
Throwin’ up the hood like a Mason
Mr. Blue Benjamin paid for the case
Jackie Tan whip it in the pan, saw you Ricki Lake
A boot of molly get your shooter shot
Boys in the hood bandana like Pac
But Cutie Pies get you First 48
Yellow Tape it closed, casket your face
Momma yellin’ KID yo baby
Pull up shooting’ Houdini in a Blue Mercedes
Bangin’ Blue Red like I’m in the 80’s
Let my bitch shoot the stick call her Tomb Raider
Send a hit at you pricks call me Longway Barbosa
