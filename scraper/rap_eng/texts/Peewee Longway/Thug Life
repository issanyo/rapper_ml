[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
Thug life, standin' on the block
Tell my mom I'm breakin' 36's down to rock
I got my middle finger up, I'm screamin', "Fuck the cops"
Thug life, pussy nigga, I'm feelin' like I'm Pac
Thug life, standin' on the block
Tell my mom I'm breakin' 36's down to rock
I got my middle finger up, I'm screamin', "Fuck the cops"
Thug life, pussy nigga, I'm feelin' like I'm Pac

[Verse 1: Offset]
Feelin’ like pac in the 80’s Versace Versace it cover my body (Versace!)
Hannah Montana gone off a Scotty
20 Bitches running round the Lobby
Vroom room on my kawasaki
Pockets stuff like a chrisma' stocking
Thug life walking round mobbin’
Money Old like Bill Cosby
Makaveli got the Mac-11
50 Bricks on the intersection
I Do what I do looking at a peasant
Can’t front you a brick you got bad credit
Fuck you and my enemies
Don’t even trust niggas thats kin to me
Technical Foul get a penalty
Sell Dope to the Economy

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
Thug life, standin' on the block
Tell my mom I'm breakin' 36's down to rock
I got my middle finger up, I'm screamin', "Fuck the cops"
Thug life, pussy nigga, I'm feelin' like I'm Pac
Thug life, standin' on the block
Tell my mom I'm breakin' 36's down to rock
I got my middle finger up, I'm screamin', "Fuck the cops"
Thug life, pussy nigga, I'm feelin' like I'm Pac

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Uh, I live a thug life trappin’ on the block
Niggas skin the Rock
Straight Drop
Right Out the Pot
My J’s Remember Me
No Strap No Trap
I’m Trappin with the Glock (Thats for my enemies)
Since an adolescent told my momma Fuck 12
I’m a grown man selling bales
Givenchy Chinchilla Shoes Jimmy Choo
Diamond hand like Pikachu
Double R Ghost come thru Peekaboo
Fool Offset Bullet-Proof
Lean mixed with the Gin and Juice
Breaking the 36 my occupation
Slangin' cocaine across the nation
Longway Nigg

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
Thug life, standin' on the block
Tell my mom I'm breakin' 36's down to rock
I got my middle finger up, I'm screamin', "Fuck the cops"
Thug life, pussy nigga, I'm feelin' like I'm Pac
Thug life, standin' on the block
Tell my mom I'm breakin' 36's down to rock
I got my middle finger up, I'm screamin', "Fuck the cops"
Thug life, pussy nigga, I'm feelin' like I'm Pac

[Verse 3: PeeWee Longway]
Thug Life, Remember Me I’m bustin’ at you cowards
Pull up like a centipede I know the Audi Growlin’
You gonna remember me, I got bricks 10-a-key
Migo Slices QuesoD, Longway PeeWee bitch not me
Back to the block with that crack (Good Crack)
Throw lil woadie them Onions
Louboutin all on my bunions
Jumanji dressed in Safari
Pull up in a California Rari
Gadgets init like Nintendo Atari
Got it from trappin the Doogie Howser
Gas smellin’ like a piss tower (uh)
Longway Nigga

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
Thug life, standin' on the block
Tell my mom I'm breakin' 36's down to rock
I got my middle finger up, I'm screamin', "Fuck the cops"
Thug life, pussy nigga, I'm feelin' like I'm Pac
Thug life, standin' on the block
Tell my mom I'm breakin' 36's down to rock
I got my middle finger up, I'm screamin', "Fuck the cops"
Thug life, pussy nigga, I'm feelin' like I'm Pac
