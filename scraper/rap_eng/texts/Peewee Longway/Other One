[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
This ain't the same Rollie, this another one
This ain't the same bitch, this another one
This ain't the same bankroll, this another one
They add up the swagger, now this is another one
The red and the yellow, I'm sipping the other one
In the kitchen remixing, I'm making it, double them
I'm still out here working the other one
I'm still out here working the other one
I'm still out here working the other one
I'm still out here working the other one
I'm still out here working the other one
I'm still out here working the other one
In the kitchen remixing, I'm making it, double them
I'm still out here working the other one
In the kitchen remixing, I'm making it, double them
I'm still out here working the other one

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
My [?] kept the [?] coming
My other one can't see them covington
Atlanta, with two when we jerking muddington
Kush, I've been [?] in my skeleton
I crank up my car, pressing buttons
I went so bizarre with the other one
I'm laid up with triplets cuddling
I come through your window like Cuddler
Balenciaga bubble gum
They gon' chew it up for something
I broke my right wrist whipping bricks
I'ma use the other one
I'm serving the junkies, having fun
Coming back with a whole ton
My young niggas terrorize with a K and a pump
Feds looking for me like I'm Sadaam

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
This ain't the same Rollie, this another one
This ain't the same bitch, this another one
This ain't the same bankroll, this another one
They add up the swagger, now this is another one
The red and the yellow, I'm sipping the other one
In the kitchen remixing, I'm making it, double them
I'm still out here working the other one
I'm still out here working the other one
I'm still out here working the other one
I'm still out here working the other one
I'm still out here working the other one
I'm still out here working the other one
In the kitchen remixing, I'm making it, double them
I'm still out here working the other one
In the kitchen remixing, I'm making it, double them
I'm still out here working the other one

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Switching bitches up and stretching the trenches
I'm still out here working the other one
They add up the swagger, dabbing in Givenchy
I got them gone on the other one
In the kitchen just whipping and making it double
Louboutin spikes, I'm walking on the Devil
My dope tester say he can't believe it's butter
I'm working the other one in the gutter
The art of my people is the President
Trapping bags in your residence
I wanna fuck you and that other bitch
That little bitch act like she celibate
Bitch, you're worthless unless you sell a brick
You try to return it, finessing with the other shit
First 48 and not a body in the ditch
Other chick, she supply me with the bricks
Chanel on my toes, simply for a Crip
A 40 on my waist, a 30 clip
I got the cameraman taking double pics
The doubler all right, that's a spaceship
Park the bitch like I'm in double-whip
Leaning on yellow like I'm in The Matrix
Scratching my palm, looking for them faces
Two fingers, one thumb, I throw up the Navy
Longway, bitch

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
This ain't the same Rollie, this another one
This ain't the same bitch, this another one
This ain't the same bankroll, this another one
They add up the swagger, now this is another one
The red and the yellow, I'm sipping the other one
In the kitchen remixing, I'm making it, double them
I'm still out here working the other one
I'm still out here working the other one
I'm still out here working the other one
I'm still out here working the other one
I'm still out here working the other one
I'm still out here working the other one
In the kitchen remixing, I'm making it, double them
I'm still out here working the other one
In the kitchen remixing, I'm making it, double them
I'm still out here working the other one
