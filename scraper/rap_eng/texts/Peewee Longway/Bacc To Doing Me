[Intro]
They got me back to doing me
What work for you don't work for me
What hurt on you don't hurt on me

[Chorus]
They got me back to doing me (back to doin' my thing)
What work for you don't work for me
What hurt on you don't hurt on me
I'm just back to doing me
They got me back to doing me
What work for you don't work for me
What hurt on you don't hurt on me
I'm just back to doing me

[Verse 1]
Back on my bullshit, back up with full clips
Back on my G, back on my hood shit
Back in the trap, stackin' and cappin'
Blue money stacked in my mattress
Old hundreds stacked in my attic
I sip on lean like an addict
Up on molly, no addys
Fuck that bitch like a savage
I leave her skirt to count package
I gotta stay active, what work for you don't work for me
I gotta stay active, what hurt on you don't hurt on me
I pop two perky pills, might drum that shoot, might work a deal
Extendo tucked with thirty kill, I might tip a bird for real
I'm back on that purge for real, I'm back havin' nerve for real
Put the drum on the forty, the curve on the chopper
And leave you on the curb for real, Longway bitch

[Chorus]
They got me back to doing me (back to doin' my thing)
What work for you don't work for me
What hurt on you don't hurt on me
I'm just back to doing me
They got me back to doing me
What work for you don't work for me
What hurt on you don't hurt on me
I'm just back to doing me

[Verse 2]
They got me back to doing me, ain't cut from my cloth or my tree
Put the snake all on my collar, wrap my buckle double G
Got two FN's and one Glock on me, no cap, can't catch no drop on me
What hurt on you don't hurt on me, a young nigga pull up the [?]
They go back to back drank with the menace
I pour back to back drank on my kidney
Lay the seat back and look at my ceilings
I worked hard for the Wraith in the kitchen (whip whip)
Back to the basic, back to re-cooking
Pull up, drop it off, I cater to you
Cubans on my neck like Django [?]
I got the box, I'll punt it to you
I got bricks of Nino, make the weight a shooter
Chopper spot you like a bloody coochie
On these hoes I'ma go Chris Brown, Karrueche
On these hoes I'ma go Chris Brown, Karrueche
Purp bitch, work bitch, twerk bitch, flirt bitch
Drop top vert with skrrt
No codefendant, I'm doin' my dirt bitch, Longway

[Chorus]
They got me back to doing me (back to doin' my thing)
What work for you don't work for me
What hurt on you don't hurt on me
I'm just back to doing me
They got me back to doing me
What work for you don't work for me
What hurt on you don't hurt on me
I'm just back to doing me
