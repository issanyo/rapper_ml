[Intro]
Hey, hey man it's your man
Whatever I say you go feel
Shame on that nigga man
Shame on you man

[Chorus]
Shame on you niggas, shame on you ni
Shame on you niggas, shame on you bitches
Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you
Feel confused, don’t know what to do and it’s a shame
Bitch gonna fuck you just to buy some food and it’s a shame
He was gangsta till he see you at the [?] and it’s a shame
Packy watch me get your body by the dumps and it’s a shame
Shame on you niggas, shame on you bitches
Shame on you niggas, shame on you bitches
Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you

[Verse 1]
Shame, shame, shame
Gang bang bang
I fuck these bitches I do want the brain
Jelly they white like they ate a crayon
Shes tryna put clothes on her baby back
I’m tryna run up a crazy sack
I’m tryna give Stella her groove back
Look bitch you gotta eat it or get it back
When you pull up I shoot at your finger cap
Make a move on the block with this clip I got
It’s shame on you he’ll lick for a rolex
I’m probably wait like bowflex
Running up with a cut, cut it up
Run a truck road go Manimut
Mr Blue bitch make double donk
Shame on you niggas I ain’t have enough
Gotta be stay, same long sword like a unicorn
I’m flyer than a Pilot in a uniform
On the mile high club on the way to Hong Kong
Shame on you niggas, he was gangsta until he seen the Pagara key
Say shame on you bitches
Super thirsty she had a pack a watch

[Chorus]
Feel confused, don’t know what to do and it’s a shame
Bitch gonna fuck you just to buy some food and it’s a shame
He was gangsta till he see you at the [?] and it’s a shame
Packy watch me get your body by the dumps and  it’s a shame
Shame on you niggas, shame on you bitches
Shame on you niggas, shame on you bitches
Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you

[Verse 2]
Count me nerdy nigga, punch still from the pack
And you trap without the strap
Don’t know what to do with you
Ain’t walk a mile in my sneakers
I [?] by it in the beaker
Two hundred and a bond of refunds
She say she gonna get freaky
She’s so confuse, don’t know what to do
She had a little baby and dropped out of school
She went for the wanna be
Ya’ll nigga really wanna be too cool, this is Deja-vu
I helped packed her waxes, get hit with the packy wack
They gonna get you front right by the doctor
Long way bitch

[Chorus]
Shame on you niggas, shame on you bitches
Shame on you niggas, shame on you bitches
Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you
Feel confused, don’t know what to do and it’s a shame
Bitch gonna fuck you just to buy some food and it’s a shame
He was gangsta till he see you at the [?] and it’s a shame
Packy watch me get your body by the dumpster and it’s a shame
Shame on you niggas, shame on you bitches
Shame on you niggas, shame on you bitches
Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you niggas, shame on you bitches
Shame on you niggas, shame on you bitches
Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you
