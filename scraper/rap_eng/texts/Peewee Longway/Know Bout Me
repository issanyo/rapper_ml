[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
They thinkin' they seen the Big Dipper
A ho on my arm, they seen the aristopher
Versace Versace my body, they thinkin' they've seen big Christopher Wallace
I'm PeeWee Longway, I'm dressed in Cavalli
I put the Deisel in OG and boxes
I keep it crippin', I'm blue than rossi’s
Holla at my bitch if I still catchin' bodies
How many makin' this Longway to top it
I keep the fruit like I'm shoppin' with Tropicana
Trappin hella trapaholic choppaholic
I keep that toolie doubled down with ammo
They callin' me John Dillinger a Rambo
You actin like Sosa they move when I say so
On my command they let the AK go
Dressed in Cavalli, cruising in a Ghost
Fingerin' sassy motherfucker doin' the move
Tell him get bricks on the boat
Damn I just hit him with 2 antidotes
Damn I just hit him with 2 and I go
I told the bitch that she gorgeous
Just a lil some to do when I get bored
Pourin' and pourin', pourin' and pourin'
Sippin' and spinnin', fucked up my Cavalli

Nigga runnin nigga spot layin' everything down (lay it down)
Then we go smell it
Nigga kill you by the ounce, nigga merk you by the pound

[Verse 3: Offset]
Giuseppe steppin cleaner than a reverend
Drippin VVSs on that Cuban necklace
Came up on a hundred, that made advancement
Niggas hatin on me, keep the Smith n Wesson
White Louis, who got that Slim Shady?
Old season clothes nigga you outdated
Hurricane wrist like I broke a levy
Entertaining yo bitch like I’m Cedric
Panorama, my 9-11
Somebody call the paramedics
Bend a ho over like Teddy
Piss on your bitch like R Kelly
I'm rollin', no Kelly
Lunatic nigga, but I am no Nelly
Handcuff Ferragamo I just got arrested
Givenchy khaki red loafers, spaghetti
I'mma startin' to rich and I'm famous
My bitch come from over they don’t speak our language
Nothing like poetry, double g's on me
Migo the army, American Gangster
Got the Offset swerving patient
Louis gooey Jimmy Chooey combination
Rick James in the 80's
Draw the fever whippin' white Katy
Cold diamonds in the 'frigerator
