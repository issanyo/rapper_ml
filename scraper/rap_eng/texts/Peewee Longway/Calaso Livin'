Imma boss lil bitch that falls for my motherfucking peyon

Miss all of a sudden she tryna put her handcuffs on me
Walking in the club, smoking out of town

And she midget but the crowds in the city screaming I’m all in
Treppin I’m trippin’ I'm breaking her promise
Still trippin’ in PeeWee

Feeling like me mini coster out here in my city
Bitch is like who is he
A motherfucking superstar or a genie
This nigga moving like Odeni
