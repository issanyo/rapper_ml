Every brick turn into 30 molly lock jaw
Hit it with the water, make it rerock

Hit it with the water, make it rerock
I wanna rock right now
Hit it with the water, make it rerock
I wanna rock right now
Hit it with the water, make it rerock
I wanna rock right now
Hit it with the water, make it rerock
I wanna rock right now
