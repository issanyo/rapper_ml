(Intro)
(Skrr! Skrr! Skrr! Daamn!)
(Longway, Longway, I Blew Out my Ears)
MPA The Kidd Whats up?!
(What's Your Motherfuckin' Purpose Nigga?)
Shout my Nigga DJ Dirty!


(Hook)
What's your motherfucking purpose
On the block ain't got no work
What's your motherfucking Purpose
Hold that Glock but you ain't murking
I'm so sick of niggas screaming that they're bosses
But they're working
I'm so sick of niggas screaming that they're bosses
Pockets hurting

(Bridge)
You fuck alot goes, but you still ain't got no money
What's your purpose?
You been trapping on the block and still ain't count a hundred. What's your purpose?
You Got extendos, and a hundred round drums and still ain't did no murkin'
You a big dog, yeah a big dog,  got it goin' but still ain't did no service
What's your motherfuckin purpose

(Verse 1)
I been jumped off the porch intent to distribute
Bands in my trunk, watching 12 in my rearview
Get the og and dope and
Beat the trap, don't move
24 hour traphouse like a drive thou
Chasing blue Benjamin's
Ay givenchy my toes maison margiella linens
I get the pot and I beat it and hit it
I ain't gonna lay up in that bitch I'm a hit it
I get so sick of niggas screaming bitches
I finger fuck the Jackson and crash the blue Benjamin's
You a boss and big dog, that ain't never working
I'm the connect and socket I ain't never searchin'
I can pull up with the trap murdered
Front it out, later, let you reimburse me
I keep the 30, cause I will murk you..
(Longway Bitch!)

(Hook)
What's your motherfucking purpose
On the block ain't got no work
What's your motherfucking Purpose
Tote that Glock but you ain't murking
I'm so sick of niggas screaming that they're bosses
But they're working
I'm so sick of niggas screaming that they're bosses
Pockets hurting

(Bridge)
You fuck alot goes, but you still ain't got no money
What's your purpose?
You been trapping on the block and still ain't count a hundred. What's your purpose?
You Got extendos, and a hundred round drums and still ain't did no murkin'
You a big dog, yeah a big dog,  got it goin' but still ain't did no service
What's your motherfuckin purpose?!

(Verse 2 )
Chasing skirts, and laying up with a bitch
She talking that shit, but I ain't servin that shit
You strapped like you really  be murking some shit
You family going to have to come I.D. your pick
I'm out here trafficking pounds in the Honda
I like the blue Benjamin's in a bundle
You niggas out here, trapper turn to bastards
I get the bricks standing land a Atlanta Falcon
Break it down, speed it up, whip Up that sho'nuff
I take a Molly brick, sack up some capsules
What the fuck is your purpose for riding around with the work and that 30 round clip if you ain't got no trap
You trying to fit in and you trying to adapt
I double park the benz in front of the trap
With double F&N's I blow off their cap
(Longway Bitch!)

(Hook)
What's your motherfucking purpose
On the block ain't got no work
What's your motherfucking Purpose
Tote that Glock but you ain't murking
I'm so sick of niggas screaming that they're bosses
But they're working
I'm so sick of niggas screaming that they're bosses
Pockets hurting
