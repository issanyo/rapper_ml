[Intro: Young Crazy]
I think it's funny now, yeah
Ayy, I do the runnin' man
Yeah, ayy, ayy, might do the runnin' man, damn
Huh, what, yeah, ayy

[Chorus: Young Crazy & Bandhunta Izzy]
I took the boy off of bags, damn he can't get money now
He mad, I'm sittin' laughin', hah, I think it's funny now
Boy I done blew a whole hundred bands
In the trap I sold a hundred grams
Damn, y'all sold one hundred grams?
Hit the plug and do the runnin' man
Runnin' man, runnin' man, damn, I do the runnin' man
I might go and do the runnin' man
Call the plug and hit him with the runnin' man
Runnin' man, runnin' man, damn, I do the runnin' man
I might go and do the runnin' man
Call the plug and hit him with the runnin' man

[Verse 1: Bandhunta Izzy]
I did the runnin' man on the plug
I did the runnin' man with the drugs
Don't do no runnin' man with no thugs
Take off the gizzy and give 'em slugs
Your bitch give me head and I dipped on her
Boy talking crazy, a brick on him
Drippin' so much that I slipped on him
Bro get me a toilet, I shitted on him
I'm rocking these Guccis like Nikes
No you can't fight me, bro I got choppers with me
Fuckin' these bitches like nothin'
Fuckin' your girl, I might got your mama with me
And boy when you see me you better start shootin'
You know that I come with the blicky with me
And no this ain't ten, no this ain't twenty
Boy I got drums and it's fifty with me

[Chorus: Young Crazy & Bandhunta Izzy]
I took the boy off of bags, damn he can't get money now
He mad, I'm sittin' laughin', hah, I think it's funny now
Boy I done blew a whole hundred bands
In the trap I sold a hundred grams
Damn, y'all sold one hundred grams?
Hit the plug and do the runnin' man
Runnin' man, runnin' man, damn, I do the runnin' man
I might go and do the runnin' man
Call the plug and hit him with the runnin' man
Runnin' man, runnin' man, damn, I do the runnin' man
I might go and do the runnin' man
Call the plug and hit him with the runnin' man

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
I did the runnin' man with the bales
Run up them benjamins on the scale
For the Lucci, yeah they wish me well
Whip up a deuce in the wishing well
Yeah, yeah, narcotics, I got the paraphernalia
Step on the brick with the remedy
Drop off my top like I'm Kennedy
Yeah, runnin' man, Mr. Blue Benjamin
I pour Wock, and that TEC on my kidney
In the trap with that Bobby and Whitney
Longway trap, I might send you a missile
Run off on the plug, shoot through his grissles
Mad at Longway, I sleep with his sister
We rock 'em and then we remix 'em
I'm Longway, the plug, the socket

[Chorus: Young Crazy & Bandhunta Izzy]
I took the boy off of bags, damn he can't get money now
He mad, I'm sittin' laughin', hah, I think it's funny now
Boy I done blew a whole hundred bands
In the trap I sold a hundred grams
Damn, y'all sold one hundred grams?
Hit the plug and do the runnin' man
Runnin' man, runnin' man, damn, I do the runnin' man
I might go and do the runnin' man
Call the plug and hit him with the runnin' man
Runnin' man, runnin' man, damn, I do the runnin' man
I might go and do the runnin' man
Call the plug and hit him with the runnin' man
