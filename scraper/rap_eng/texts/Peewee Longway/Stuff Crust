[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
We rollin' 2 gram doobies
Point 5 for cuties
Blowin San Francisco cookies
It's bout to be a movie
Call me PeeWee Tarantino
Big clouds of weed smoke
Hashing flash like a weed low
Start crushing till we overdose
Stuffin crust
Stuffin crust
Stuffin crust
Stuffin crust

[Verse 1:]
In the trap house man a homie stuff crust gas
Put down swisher roll up gas
Stuff crust the backwoods at
Ain't no pressure got alot of bag
Ye Ain't got to worry about puff puff pass
You can roll your own just keep mine fat
Blowing cookie its a smell in a vent Smell in the bed
San Francisco you got to be a player to get that
I'm a boss I got me a mailman conncet
In the long life long blunt power incense
Rent man calling it's a scrunch mail in it
Blowing gas with a bad bitch, she gaggin' and shit
My bad I stuck 2 grams in this spliff
I forgot you smoke point 5 cute shit
Baby gone ahead and catch a breath
I'm a stuff crust another while the rent man trip
How you caught a nigga moving how I kick big shit
But the whole band camp stuff crust like this
In the cut with 4 sluts got big butts
I'm amazed once a star crust hit swisher
And I can't wait to smoke it with her
On cookies she throwin up
Make movies we stuffin' crust

[Verse 2:]
Give me a swisher so I can roll up
And I'm leaning so hard look like I'm doing the hold on
No smile blush, your blunt need to grow up
And I keep that gag in me alive so I can blow up
I need more haters, that's why I smoke a pound a day
I need some acres
I keep a blunt on me like it's my firearm
We in the club for one reason
Set out the fire alarm
Them fat blunts that's how we smoke
And it ain't strong if you don't choke
Fuck the nike deal I should sign with coke
We getting fields of that shit
On a fucking boat
