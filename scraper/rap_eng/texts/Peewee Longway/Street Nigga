[Intro: PeeWee Longway]
Longway Longway Bitch
All Blue on my End
Free the Wop bitch, you know whats happenin'
Longway Chapo, All that

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
I’m a Street Nigga dawg, put that pack on rice street
Drop that ticket so cheap El Chapo had to see
Piranahas all around me can’t nobody get to Wee
Molly well protected, trappin’ out the P.C
Went from bales, in the county jail sipping’ PT's
I’m the chief, and I got Indians, smoke you like TeePee
Bad bitch, think she, sneaking
Pay that bitch in Blue Benjamin's, watch how she Juug for me

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
She love a Street Nigga, dog, (x2)
She love Street Nigga just like Wee
She love a Street Nigga, dog, (x2)
I’m a Street Nigga dog, I stay strapped with 30’s round me
I’m a Street Nigga dog,I  Finesse the 30 pounds
I’m a Street Nigga dog, trappin off the greyhound
I’m a street nigga dog, Bodies in the lost and found
I’m a street nigga dawg, Heard the  Gucci Mane in Me
Bought a whole hundred pounds cause the shit so cheap
I’m a street nigga dawg, you hear the Gucci Mane and Me
Bought a whole hundred pounds cause the shit so cheap

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Flippin the packages
Stacking’ the stacks
She bringing me L-B's
Sippin on Actavis
Gas-Pack, I serve the jail weed
Pointers in my ear 50 piece
Make you google the net worth of PeeWee
Solitary Ear 3D
In the Trap House on repeat
I be fly as a lear, (turn up)
Hey there my dear, (woo)
I make a hundred Juug Disappear, on a mega-bus
Tussin' that Sipper, 30 round Clipper
3 Bitches Longway Jack Tripper
Bird on my neck Big Dipper
Yo Bitch just love a Street Nigga

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
She love a Street Nigga, dog, (x2)
She love Street Nigga just like Wee
She love a Street Nigga, dog, (x2)
I’m a Street Nigga dog, I stay strapped with 30’s round me
I’m a Street Nigga dog,I Finesse the 30 pounds
I’m a Street Nigga dog, trappin off the greyhound
I’m a street nigga dog, Bodies in the lost and found
I’m a street nigga dawg, Heard the Gucci Mane in Me
Bought a whole hundred pounds cause the shit so cheap
I’m a street nigga dawg, you hear the Gucci Mane and Me
Bought a whole hundred pounds cause the shit so cheap
