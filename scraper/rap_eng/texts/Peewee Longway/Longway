[Intro]
I got Longway with me
And we done ran that sack up crazy
I need to see as I got you
Cause I done ran that sack up crazy
For her ring I bought her diamonds
20 bands got me at your lady
And if I'm lying then I'm flying
I swear to god I done ran that sack up
I got Longway with me
And we done ran that sack up crazy
I need to see as I got you
Cause I done ran that sack up crazy
For her ring I bought her diamonds
20 bands got me at your lady
And if I'm..

[Hook]
I got Longway with me
And we done ran that sack up crazy
I need to see as I got you
Cause I done ran that sack up crazy
For her ring I bought her diamonds
20 bands got me at your lady
If I'm lying then I'm flying
I swear to God I done ran that sack up crazy

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Longway my brother
I say blood couldn't make us closer
Different daddy, different mothers
If I'm with him you know it's over
Thou shall ride for ya brother
I mean protect him through whatever
If we don't win, we lose together
Made it my oath, this shit forever
I say I stretch my money the longway
If I need some lean, I'm calling Longway
I got her holding me the strongway
And everything I said true
So listen to what the song say, nigga!

[Hook]

[Bridge]
We done ran up, ran up, ran up, ran that sack up crazy
(longway, longway, longway)
We done ran up, ran up
We done ran that sack crazy
(longway, longway, longway) (2x)

[Verse 2: Peewee Longway]
I was schizo for them Benjamin's, they say I do the most
Double R with the big grill, I'm pulling up in the Ghost
I got longway money, and a whole lot of rich homies
So lot of bands, thumbing through cash
Double down you know it's on me
20 bands on your bitch, she wanted diamonds
I bought her the rollie rollie
Flooded her out with big gas, I got it out the Pyrex
Whipping up the doughnut, the holey moley
She didn't know this, she kick it with a D-boy
Call rich homie, we kick it Bruce Leeroy
So many bands stuffed in my pants
Running through the weed, feed me, Seymour
I running the sack up crazy (too cray, too cray, too cray!)
I'm running the sack up crazy (bam! bam! bam! bam! bam!)
I'm flying out to the bay, (outta here! outta here! outta here! Gone!)
Those are the risks that I take!
