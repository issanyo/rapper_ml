Go across the county black people they know my name
I know you niggas know I did 8 months up in the chains
Straight up out the pen I hit the jeweller bought some chains

Got some money in my pocket I had to step up my posture
Steve Nashing these bitches we fuck 'em then we departure
I never cross 'em I swear I'll kill for my partners
Play with my money you gon' be talking to doctors
50k a show my nigga and the crowd is colossus
I'm watching these bitches they plotting gotta stay cautious
I done took losses like a diamond nigga I'm flawless
All of this money making me dizzy I'm feeling nauseous
I'm sipping on Actavis like I got a cough problem

Entrepreneur we did this shit independent

Got your bitch feeling she tryna drink up my semen
