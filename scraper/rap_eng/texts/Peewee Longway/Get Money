[Intro]
Bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money (ATL Jacob)
Cass', what it do, nigga?
Swear that engineer
That boy Cassius

[Chorus]
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money
Fuck niggas, get money
The boot kicked in, bitch I’m yawnin'
I heard they robbin', I stay strapped up with that carbon
That pussy sorry, I’m not judgin', I'm just honest
Fuck bitches, get money

[Verse 1]
I'm just sayin', the love for cash is deeper than blood (That boy Cassius)
Flippin' bud, stackin' dub, through the mud, steppin' through it
I need Fiji water when it’s time to do it, let’s get to it
I make entrees in my trap like Ruby Tuesday
My doorman get the back door with the Uzi
In the double R, I'm makin’ porn movies
Her seat like margarine butter, switcharoo the groupie
Fuck bitches, get money
I step on a bitch in Givenchy
It's home, they Longway Winston
She want a Longway ending
Mr. Blue Benjamins spendin'
Grab on her inches and beat it
She might just get a new freezer
Paint her face like Mona Lisa
Pussy bad, delete her
I got four-four-eight good reefer, bring me blue monefa
I'm the blue Bathing Ape, call me Longway Caesar
I got warrants goin’ poof, paper cuts and teasers
Tell your baby daddy the truth, I'm the one that please you

[Chorus]
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money
Fuck niggas, get money
The boot kicked in, bitch I'm yawnin'
I heard they robbin', I stay strapped up with that carbon
That pussy sorry, I'm not judgin', I'm just honest
Fuck bitches, get money

[Verse 2]
I'll sell a bitch if dream come to Ebenezer
Longway team, Jimmy Dean, give you amnesia
I swipe your ho, that's why I call my main a master Visa
The way they worship me, they should call me Blue Jesus
Two-tone Rollie, came below degrees, okay
Usuain Bolt, got the need for speed
Diamond dial green like the seaweed
Get the pack back, rollin', I'm the plug for weed
What you holdin'? Guacomole, got the dope for soda
Watch me wrap this like Chipotle, I can serve it to you molded
Trap on Two Island Tuesday, all my junkies get a boulder
Beef, we don't discuss, we just gon' pull up with them blowers
Went from two for five trappin', now I'm tappin' in with Forbes
Now I'm FedEx to UPS to Post Office with drugs
When it touch down, bust a bale, water, Michael Phelps
Cuban link around my neck look like a clean brick of meth

[Chorus]
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money
Fuck niggas, get money
The boot kicked in, bitch I'm yawnin'
I heard they robbin', I stay strapped up with that carbon
That pussy sorry, I'm not judgin', I'm just honest
Fuck bitches, get money

[Outro]
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money
