[Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
My Migo got work
But he work outs the Home Depot Gracias amigo
Que vaminos on a Banana boat
Pull up like Craig on a Friday might hit you with a brick like Debo
Might just traffic it to Connecticut stuff 50 bricks in my exit

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Going’ for the gusto
Shot him in the head he was cutthroat
Tony Montana Banana Boat, my nuts are bigger than Cantaloupes
Taking the trip for the OG reefer
Bricks of the boy call is Justin Bieber
New pack of Benjies leave it to beaver
Looking like a pretty penny sitting on the sofa talking to Wendy Williams
Longways give that bitch the business, how you be fucking these bitches
Switcheroo Pull up and pick a boo
I might be dressed as Obama foo
Maison Margiela full of residue
Play with the brick don’t waste I’mma shoot
Get out my mix bitch I don’t fuck with you
Line like the wick when I say I got juice
Sipping on lean like its a double deuce
Deebo diamonds make em tuck in his chain
Taking the world like I’m Pinky and Brain
Chief Keef bang bang bang bang
All my niggas gone gang bang, throw it up bang bang

[Hook: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Them free-shooters got a lot of throw aways
You a easy target like a free throw
Got young nigga pull up to your back door
Turn a young nigga head to a peep hole
Got chicos that RICO for Pablo
They shoot you whenever I say so!
Bentley I pick up the gas, Double R nigga I drop off the yayo

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
Got the bricks in Cinco De Mayo
Got the bricks in Cinco De Mayo
Me and my whole crew going for the gusto
Got the bricks in Cinco De Mayo
Got the bricks in Cinco De Mayo
Got the bricks in Cinco De Mayo
Me and my whole crew going for the gusto
Bricks

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Coming through your backdoor
Shooting through your peephole
Wrap your ass up like a motherfuckin’ gyro
Sippin on lean out the styro
Skrt pull up in the nitro
I heard it was Cinco De Mayo
Got bricks wanna send to Ohio
Take a nigga load yeah we going for the gusto
Fly to LA to get Cinco
My plug in San Fransisco got Nabisco
Wrap it up and shoot it from the free throw
Looking at the mailman through the peep hole
I’m so Carlito, I wrap Medical
I fuck erry hoe
I’m not gon freeze I’m on go

[Hook: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
