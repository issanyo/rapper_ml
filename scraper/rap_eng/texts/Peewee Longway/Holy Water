[Chorus: Lil Papi Jay]
All them diamonds 'round my neck, call that holy water
All them diamonds on my wrist, call that holy water
All them diamonds in my ring, call that holy water
I was baptized in them jewels, now the devil callin'
All them diamonds 'round my neck, call that holy water
All them diamonds on my wrist, call that holy water
All them diamonds in my ring, call that holy water
I was baptized in them jewels, now the devil callin'

[Verse 1: Lil Papi Jay]
All them diamonds 'round my neck, call that holy water
Pussy nigga speakin' on me, they don't want these problems
I might bounce out of that whip with that forty on me
MRE be the gang, yeah we money hungry
Lil nigga fly as hell, YSL
Got a white bitch bring me money, call it Kel
Delivered it up like it's mail
In the trap boomin', got the digital scale
Water 'round my neck, swim with the whales
Free my dog out the cell
And when Kooda get home, I'ma put water on my brother neck too
Fuck 12 and them snake hoes, in the trap runnin' this check fool
Sick with the blues, sippin' Hi-Tech out the juice, pack passin', makin' moves
Road runnin', fuck the bitch by the two
Reach for my chain, get hit with that tool, bitch nigga

[Chorus: Lil Papi Jay]
All them diamonds 'round my neck, call that holy water
All them diamonds on my wrist, call that holy water
All them diamonds in my ring, call that holy water
I was baptized in them jewels, now the devil callin'
All them diamonds 'round my neck, call that holy water
All them diamonds on my wrist, call that holy water
All them diamonds in my ring, call that holy water
I was baptized in them jewels, now the devil callin'

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Reach for my chain, we catching some stains
X, purple, Kurt Cobain
Cookin' these cartoon bricks of cocaine
Uh, bust down the Rollie like mold
Call me two, I go dozen the roses
I get two Loub, it triple, it double
Bitches sneeze and I booger the bezel
Go Picasso, I paint the Margielas
I mean bless you, you step on the devil
I put spikes on my coat like I'm Elvis
I'm in DGI, drop by the shelter
Diamonds 3D, they jump out and blind you
Bullets GPS, reroute and find you
I go UPS, two doors look down
My pinky ring cost two nines
Pop a J out the wreck, check the tests
I got pints of the Act, come from Texas
When I walk with that MAC, I got extras
From the Bay to the A on them Teslas
In the coupe, Forgis glide like the Jetsons
When you reach you gon' die 'bout this necklace
Yellow tape gang, white sketches
Holy ghost water in my necklace
I got edibles all in my skeleton (Longway bitch)

[Chorus: Lil Papi Jay]
All them diamonds 'round my neck, call that holy water
All them diamonds on my wrist, call that holy water
All them diamonds in my ring, call that holy water
I was baptized in them jewels, now the devil callin'
All them diamonds 'round my neck, call that holy water
All them diamonds on my wrist, call that holy water
All them diamonds in my ring, call that holy water
I was baptized in them jewels, now the devil callin'
