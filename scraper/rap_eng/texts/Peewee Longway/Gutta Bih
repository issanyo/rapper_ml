[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Fifty for my Rollie
Heroin bricks, they look like Beijing
Ride them Forgis like they swangers
Kurt Cobain, I'm sippin' on codeine
Lemon tree, smokin' on Do-Si-Dos
Droppin' the top on the Holy Ghost
Who you know play in the bowl the most?
Stack it up, load it up, get it and go
Whoa, trap at the cornerstore
Whoa whoa, workin' the high low
Hit the link in my bio
We wrappin' up shit like a gyro
QB the play, throw the spiral
Longway Pacino, Dinero
Dolce Gabbana from Melrose
I wrap the brick up with velcro
I put the dick on Griselda, uh
It's cheap but it keep it so stellar
I turned all my bitches to Bella
I hide my money with the shovel
I shoot underground at the devil
Brrah, Cuban links on me like Shocker, ooh
Want medical pills, I'm the doctor, huh
I'm Hennessy man with the vodka, Longway, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
Wake up and bake it
Draco go baka
Narcotics, I got it
Got bodies like Gotti
Fly private, I'm pilot
My bitch bougie, I'm vibin'
Purple Backwood, biscotti
Roll the flash and paparazzi

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
Hit it, this my other shit
Drop the top when I pull up with my gutter bitch
When I wake up, doin' sit-ups, she be suckin' dick
I do drop-offs in my pickup with my gutter bitch
This that other shit, this that other shit
When I pull up, drop the top, I'm with my gutter bitch
This that other shit, this that other shit
I do drop-offs in my pickup with my gutter bitch

[Verse 2: Plies]
I don't trust hoes like I don't trust jewelers
Brrt in your medulla
I'm a big dawg, your man a poodle
Keep me a pole, I don't need no shooter
Pussy ain't fire, then bitch I lose you
You ain't my lady, then bitch I use you
Had me another good bag day
You don't want me to fuck, don't at me
I been runnin' up racks this year
Y'all lil' niggas been cap this year
Everywhere you look in my house is marble
Everything you see on my neck is water
I ain't too rich to tote choppers still
Streets, they'll tell you ain't robbin' him
Pussy, don't come with the head
Then tell your best friend, "Sis, don't bother him"

[Pre-Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
Wake up and bake it
Draco go baka
Narcotics, I got it
Got bodies like Gotti
Fly private, I'm pilot
My bitch bougie, I'm vibin'
Purple Backwood, biscotti
Roll the flash and paparazzi

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
Hit it, this my other shit
Drop the top when I pull up with my gutter bitch
When I wake up, doin' sit-ups, she be suckin' dick
I do drop-offs in my pickup with my gutter bitch
This that other shit, this that other shit
When I pull up, drop the top, I'm with my gutter bitch
This that other shit, this that other shit
I do drop-offs in my pickup with my gutter bitch
