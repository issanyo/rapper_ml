[Verse 1: Tk-n-Cash]
(Talk to em)
It's four in the Morning,this girl wanna smash
(Ya'll like that)
But I cannot do it i'm tryna get cash
They callin my phone,they offering deals
A lot of you niggas don't know how it feel
That pressure, Nigga catch ya
Og's they callin me nasty
No flex, but a young nigga flexin
Been through this shit young nigga patched up
I ain't even tryna talk to them niggas
But the niggas tryna talk big figures
Them niggas got packs on the wall
My niggas got packs in the wall
They following me movin we all on the road (we all on the roadx2)
So where were ya'll niggas when they called me cold
(were ya'll niggas when they called me cold)

I'ma be off of this shit till i'm dead and gone
