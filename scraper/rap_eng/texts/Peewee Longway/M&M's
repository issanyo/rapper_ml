[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
You a hustler nigga water whipping
Getting it out the bowl
How you countin up the mili nigga
Put it on the road
She work for a quarter milly clapping her ass
Sliding down the pole
She fucking nn million dollar nigga
He fucking no million dollar hoe
No M&M's
His home though more than a million
With no M&M's on the low
Don't fuck with no peon young niggas
I put those M&M's on the road
Me and my bitch Jay Z and Beyonce got
Got them M&M's on you hoes
I see them M&M nigga Ray Charles blindfold

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Tucking the kid again
Hoppin up on the boat like im Gilligan
Fucking around with the M&M
Got me taking up flashing them creeps again
Thumbing' thru nothing but Benjamin's
How can I how can I help you dear
I only talk for some ear in your ear
Your diamonds so clear, my maddam my dear
I fly at the pizzle for a slice of that pizza
Minus the Jay-Z with double Monifa
Better be careful don't look at me B
Type in your google and look for peewee
Longway, I make you throw your thousands away (stuff crust it bae)
It's PeeWee Longway with the M&M
My bank accounts sayin no M&M
The benz I'm in is a concept
That bitch ain't even drop yet
My fith pocket is some molly
Take off like a rocket
Them hoes be sayin they're sick of him
I dress my bitch and she shit on them
I make her bag as I set her lane
They callin her shit ridiculous

Put gasoline all over in that airplane
On the road to longway blue to M&M
And I don't fuck around with no peon
Can't hit my weed hit a leave it alone
Big bird account get his egg beater on
Trying 2 duece to a four not to a half
God damn that's what need you to sign
Trapper turn to a rapper sell 'em bricks with the bags
She made a quarter mil on the pole singing that
Fishtailin' not to major riot on my ass
Matte Black Jag squatin on them Forgi's
M&M got a nigga VVS' glass
Met my main bitch Jay Z Beyonce
Spending M&M's on with the same lane
Spending M&M's just to fuck Ri-Ri
Dope dicking your bitch now she geeked
You claim you're hussling when you're moneefa them

Big bank no dubs on PeeWee
