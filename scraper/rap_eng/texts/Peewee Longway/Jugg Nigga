[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
5 stopper Magnum break, no spike knock you off
In the foreign paddle
In the rrari it doesn't cash out
A thousand bucks touch a nigga
Call me cash out
You dropping door nigga
Take his ass out
You're a jugg nigga, we will take your ass out
You're a jugg nigga, we will take your ass out
Around hood nigga, we will take your ass out
A thousand racks put you, we will take your ass out

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
I got racks, I got racks, I got racks
I baked your drunk ass
A thousand bands I decade we just took off in here
I roll around with that AK
I know you see by that brick
Fuck him just set him naughty
Keep calling me and my hottie
I ain't half no nigga
I'm still in the line running around
With the same dough tell like you on me on cabin
You know the green night a chopper nigga
With a New York nigga rockin niggas
And my braat might've popped a nigga
Real money not monopoly nigga
And those still can't serve you in the roast
Sorry in the ghost
Sorry in the rrari for them dollar
MPA see y'all, MPA boss
Count back home get bail for it

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
5 stopper Magnum break, no spike knock you off
In the foreign paddle
In the rrari it doesn't cash out
A thousand bucks touch a nigga
Call me cash out
You dropping door nigga
Take his ass out
You're a jugg nigga, we will take your ass out
You're a jugg nigga, we will take your ass out
Around hood nigga, we will take your ass out
A thousand racks put you, we will take your ass out
