[Hook]
Imma million dollar nigga out drug dealin'
One button, and the coupe do away with the ceiling
All these bitches wanna fuck on the thug
Fly as a bitch on Aladdin rug
Got these bitch nigga's, caught in the feelings
Cheetah van looking for your bitch
Cheetah van looking for your bitch
Ain't too many bitches that a nigga ain't hit
European tailor made fit, European tailor made fit
Fly as a bitch on a latin rug
European tailor made kicks


[Verse 1]
European tailor made whip
Swervin' the bitch from the passenger side
Playin' with the bandz that flipped
Tailor made Givenchy European cut
Leave out the club, everytime spring break
Get jumped by three sluts
Butt, butt, butt
Gotta cheetah van lookin' for your bitch
She on molly, goin' up
Wanna switcharoo the homie yeah she say its her choice
[?]
Sneakin' and geakin' I'm trippin' off the NASA
One eye watchin' the bitch sleep like I'm slick rick
New bitch in my pocket like sweet lint
Fuck around and get your ass hit
With the hit stick, like the replay on Madden
Zoned out millionaire, young nigga habbits
Millionaire boy club, [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't too many bitches that a nigga ain't hit
Cruisin' the Jag like I'm layin' on the roar
Fortunetlly I'm on the low, three piece
In the back seat, three peice, white meat
Pants swaggin', bitch can't bite me
New balenciaga to spite me
None of these bitches can't bite me
Feel like a young nigga Michael
Thriller, my fuckin' [?]
Look at you, goin' and pick the jury
Slummed out millionaire, treckin' in Missouri
Cocaine peril [?] calling them tourist
[?] hard top, soft top
Bought it from dealin' all the drugs

[Hook]
