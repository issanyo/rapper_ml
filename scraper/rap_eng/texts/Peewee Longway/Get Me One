[Chorus: Peewee Longway]
Hold a nigga's nuts, you know the same what them hoes do
Say I wasn't gon' make it, nigga took it and showed you
Early in the morning, sip that lean like it's Folgers
Fucked my mama's dishes up, I'm cookin' that yola, ayy
They got some pretty little ladies out in Cali, I'ma get me one, I'ma get me one
They say them birdies ten a key in Tennessee, you better get you one, better get you one, hit

[Verse 1: Peewee Longway]
Longway Boston George Diego
Flew to Cali, bought some yayo
Homies in the cut like Fredo
With them four-fours and them Dracos
Paint that shit like Mayco
Perfecto, we like Picasso
Skinny tires on the Forgis
The foreign pull up like slideshow
Goin' back to Cali, we wrap them bricks up like gyro
'Tussin, they sip out the styro'
Droppin' a ticket, done with Akademiks
Hold a nigga nuts, done went too viral
Young nigga thinkin', man I see the margin
Victory, sippin' safari
Uh, give bitches that dick with the calamari
Pretty lady in Cali, I'ma get me one
Overnight the box, it come tomorrow
Tennessee bricks for the ten a key
Two bitches a brick and they double D
Double FN, that mean double D
I feed all my dawgs good Pedigree
Went through jail walls like I'm Willie B
Standin' four feet tall with the Shaq feet
Longway, bitch

[Chorus: Peewee Longway]
Hold a nigga's nuts, you know the same what them hoes do
Say I wasn't gon' make it, nigga took it and showed you
Early in the morning, sip that lean like it's Folgers
Fucked my mama's dishes up, I'm cookin' that yola, ayy
They got some pretty little ladies out in Cali, I'ma get me one, I'ma get me one
They say them birdies ten a key in Tennessee, you better get you one, better get you one

[Verse 2: LoLife Blacc]
Totin' sticks like the Masters for niggas, I put a hole in one
LoLife Blacc, he'll never be cloned, Jet Li, I'm the only one
MPA, these pieces customized, yeah they a one of one
Give you eighty-two grams, drop it straight, you get a thirty-one
These niggas pussy in player clothes, you gotta be aware
Seen what you'll do for pussy, hate to see you caught with squares
All that dick-ridin' obviously ain't gettin' you nowhere
Dick-ridin' a form of transportation, bus stops everywhere
Just havin' dreams of thirty-six like, "Damn, I gotta get me one"
This rap don't work, back to the trap, workin' the other one
Money, pounds, and ammunition, shit, I'm havin' all of them
'Member on the hill, ashy, broke, them hoes doubted him

[Chorus: Peewee Longway]
Hold a nigga's nuts, you know the same what them hoes do
Say I wasn't gon' make it, nigga took it and showed you
Early in the morning, sip that lean like it's Folgers
Fucked my mama's dishes up, I'm cookin' that yola, ayy
They got some pretty little ladies out in Cali, I'ma get me one, I'ma get me one
They say them birdies ten a key in Tennessee, you better get you one, better get you one
