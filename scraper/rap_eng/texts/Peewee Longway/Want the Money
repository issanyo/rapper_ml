[Bridge: PeeWee Longway]
Can't nothing beat the failure but a try
Well I'm trying to get me some money
Bitch want to fucking lay up all night
Well I'm trying to get me some money
I can't wait to stay down 'til I get right
Well I'm trying to get me some money
Sending packs state to state whatever flavor you like
Long as you sending your money

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I just want the money baby, I just want the money
I just want the money baby, I just want the money
I just want the money baby, I just want the money
I just want the money baby, I just want the money

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Run it up then I fuck on every bitch that I like
All she wanted was two hunna
Bricks in the fender, bags in the trunk of the Honda
That bitch ain't goin' chasing that money
No I'm not new to this money
I'm so consistent with thumbing
Trap that bitch spot before she get a single buck
That O.J. Mayo like I play for the Bucks
Slam dunking from the A to the Gump
Good clean came in, went and criss crossed them
Hit with the beater watch it come back
You ain't seen a nigga face in the trap in a while
Must've thought I fucked up ain't coming back
I send my shooters come in back-to-back
That's just because of my social status
Bitch mad that a nigga hit the trap all night
Ain't got the time to get the groceries baby
They pull up to the trap like vultures
Longway consistent in motion
Watching the pack just scatter like roaches
The spot on Beta XXX, beat it down, got ghost
I just want the money baby, I just want the money
I just want the money baby, I just want the money

[Bridge: PeeWee Longway]
Can't nothing beat the failure but a try
Well I'm trying to get me some money
Bitch want to fucking lay up all night
Well I'm trying to get me some money
I can't wait to stay down 'til I get right
Well I'm trying to get me some money
Sending packs state to state whatever flavor you like
Long as you sending your money

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I just want the money baby, I just want the money
I just want the money baby, I just want the money
I just want the money baby, I just want the money
I just want the money baby, I just want the money

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Money money money put a ring on it
I'm a rapper but you know I'm gon’ sing on it
All white everything lookin’ clean on it
Ain't Kevin Gates but I might put a band on it

[Bridge: PeeWee Longway]
Can't nothing beat the failure but a try
Well I'm trying to get me some money
Bitch want to fucking lay up all night
Well I'm trying to get me some money
I can't wait to stay down 'til I get right
Well I'm trying to get me some money
Sending packs state to state whatever flavor you like
Long as you sending your money

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I just want the money baby, I just want the money
I just want the money baby, I just want the money
I just want the money baby, I just want the money
I just want the money baby, I just want the money
