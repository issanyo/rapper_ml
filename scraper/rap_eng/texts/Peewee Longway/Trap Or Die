[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I still run the trap, fuck what 12 say
I still shoot a fuck nigga dead in his face
Yeah, we trap or die nigga (trap or die nigga)
Trap Or Die, Trap Or Die , rubberband a dime
Slap the dope down the sank
Know the neighbors telling
Keeping down the weed stank
Yeah, Trap Or Die nigga
Yeah, We Trap or Die nigga

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Gas Bag, Flipping bricks
Trappin out the Cul de sac
Know the neighbors pointing finger
Where you get the work at
OG, Cookie, Purple Actavis, Servin' Percocet
All of my bullets are pro active
Your face is where I’m aiming at
Trap or Die I made a name in that
Put the pack all on the plane
Drop it at whatever address you tell me
United Postal or even Fedex
Trap or die got your bitch havin' sex
Sending me freaky pics all in my text
I take the good gas and I run the projects
All of my muscles are long and bo-flex
My weed is so strong the calling it Lex (Strong)
I got that Luger, that cookie, da best
That trap or die jet trap or die jet
His face on the news, his face on your chest
I play with the two, put a nigga to rest
A 2 gram doobie, don’t roll nothin' less
In my trap house all my niggas stuff crust
Nosey ass neighbors, ain’t shit to discuss

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I still run the trap, fuck what 12 say
I still shoot a fuck nigga dead in his face
Yeah, we trap or die nigga (trap or die nigga)
Trap Or Die, Trap Or Die, rubberband a dime
Slap the dope down the sank
Know the neighbors telling
Keeping down the weed stank
Yeah, Trap Or Die nigga
Yeah, We Trap or Die nigga
