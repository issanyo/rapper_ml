[Hook: Young Thug]
Got a whole lot of lost footage
Got a whole lot of Tony Montana
Gota whole lot of birds in the Phantom
Got a whole lot of nats and tenders
I'mma roll when they tell me to roll

[Verse 1]
Bought a house and a chef came with the kitchen
Bought a car and a coupe came with the digits
I used to be one of those niggas that was penny pinching

Bitches hand the pussy and you know I'm gon' reach it (bitch)
Reaching for my [?] dick [?]
Main bitch cap a lots of G, Riii, rii (skrt)

Damn, lamb, skrt, Porsche, skrt (Thugger)
You can call these shoes hot, they custom, he hustle

Hundred choppers, I can't fear
Everyone look like ants, I'm not near
