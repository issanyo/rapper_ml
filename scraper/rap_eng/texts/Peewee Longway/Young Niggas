Strapped up, Juggin' them onions

[Verse 2 - HoodRich Pablo Juan]
I was a youngin' thuggin' Till I got plugged in
To the drugs and the money, but he ain't really want it
Started smokin with junkies, I ain't too proud to beg David Ruffen
[PeeWee Longway]
My young niggas in the hood banging like colors
Pull up at the back and hit yo ass with them cutters
[HoodRich Pablo Juan]
And watch how I'm coming
I feed em bananas they acting monkey
I still got to blast cuz my young nigga buggin
Serving bunyuns, stepping on a brick
I break it down into onions and give it to youngin'
Trap stay open like a dunkin donuts
I'ma whip up the O's and serve all the junkies
Will serve em with a Rollie bezel 40 pointer
Listen to Tom Joyner early morning
New release on the brick stamped Michael Jordan
Trap with no strap kick his ass off the corner

[Chorus]
In a Traphouse full of them young niggas
Strapped up, Juggin' them onions
Front a Big Bomb to my young niggas
Then them young niggas come burn it
Put it on the line for them young niggas
They take the charge big dawg can't go to the chamber
Young niggas twistin they fingers
All of my young niggas gang bangers (Throw it up, Crip)
