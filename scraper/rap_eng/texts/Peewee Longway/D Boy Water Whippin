[Hook]
Catch it from the doctor
Fuckin chickens, thirty sixes
Take it to the kitchen water whip me up some chickens
Break it down in pieces feed it to the pigeons
Number one drug dealer trappin' in my pennies

D-Boy watch me spin it

D-Boy Water Whippin

[Verse 1]
Trap boy, OG, water whippin'
Four pyrex on the stove, I'm cookin'
Driveway full, like my shows, all booked up
Bag in the rear, drop the loads on the pick up
Double down, two .44's, this a stick up!
Shot made, don't nobody move, damn dumbfucks
D-boy, Stan Smith shoes when I re-up
Now it take four or five plugs serve me when I re-up
Take four or five plugs to serve me when I re-up
One quesadilla, Jamaican for the reefer
Presidential reefer, it's a pleasure to fuckin' meetin' ya
Two or three hoes I done cheated just for condos
Need new spots for my ice and my coco
Early in the mornin', sippin' mud, not cocoa
Servin' off the block, [?] called a nigga loco
Met a new amigo outta fuckin' coco loco
Made him feel like Lulu, he ain't gettin' the dope back though
Whip it real hard put his ass out the back door
Made his ass valet, named his ass Django
Nigga I'mma show your ass how to whip the white though
No insurance hit your hoe nigga call Geico
Pop a molly on a all night flight though
Whippin' up the whippin' up the whippin' up the good dope
Trappin' out the bags out the bags out the bando

[Hook]
Catch it from the doctor
Fuckin chickens, thirty sixes
Take it to the kitchen water whip me up some chickens
Break it down in pieces feed it to the pigeons
Number one drug dealer trappin' in my pennies
D-Boy Water Whippin
D-Boy Water Whippin

[Verse 2]
Pull up to the dock, I Gilligan
What you whippin' in the pot, off-white Pigeons
White Frank, in the trunk of the foreigners
[?]
Comin' in my shop young nigga pistol whip ya
Fillin' up the vault Michael Epps about my Benjamins
Fillin' up the vault Michael Epps about my Benjamins
Wendy Williams ya'll niggas really bitches
Thug ass impersonating D-Boy image
Lettuce in your pocket fake belt by Fendi
Ain't stay down in the trap or the trenches
D-boy, nigga, put it in your whole throat
Make her hit the interstate with pounds and the blocks
D-Block I ain't Jadakiss in The Lox
Around the fuckin' hill with Molly Santan' rock
D-boy, the longway rock my knot
Trap boomin' the longway they on my knots
Rocky Balboa I'm the type on my watch
Bop bop bop bop, got it out the pot
Papi told me, "one minute, meet him at the dock"
Like a quarter til, quarter or two of motherfuckin' rocks

[Hook]
Catch it from the doctor
Fuckin chickens, thirty sixes
Take it to the kitchen water whip me up some chickens
Break it down in pieces feed it to the pigeons
Number one drug dealer trappin' in my [?]
