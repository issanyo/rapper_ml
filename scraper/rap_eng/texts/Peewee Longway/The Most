[Intro]
(I do the most, I do the most, I do the most
I do the most, I do the most, bitch I'm the GOAT)

[Pre-Hook]
Ain't never missed a shot on that work they say that I'm the GOAT
Stars in the ceiling I'm pulling up in the Ghost
Bitch it ain't no dinin' in, you get this dick to-go
I'm a gas bag trapper, stack them bands up like it's blow

[Hook x2]
I do the most, I do the most, I do the most
I do the most, I do the most, bitch I'm the GOAT

[Verse 1]
Cuban link around my fuckin throat
Crip blue my bandana, bitch I'm mutherfuckin locc
Overnight them gas bags, bricks come on a boat
Longway Sean Michael jumpin off the top fuckin rope
Peter piper you can pick a pocket, big chop in the piper
Hand chopper, I'm a fuckin sniper, drums on the rifle
Your momma still call you Baby Boy
I change your fuckin diaper
I'm a 80 crack slanger, twist my fingers and I bang it
I got clean like a stainless steal, and white white like a handkerchief
Flippin the package, stackin blue Benjamin, pints of lean codeine dranker
Dabbin in Buscemi figure I'll trap in this shit remix big (?)
Crip blue 63 got the seat back just like I'm layin'
Longway bitch

[Pre-hook]
Ain't never missed a shot on that work they say that I'm the GOAT

Fuck that lil bitch for a Birkin
Still duckin bosses, the south side still go collect.(?)
Thats true they livin in poverty
Pop up blue Crip my Rarri on my property
Hop out with sticks do the most for the Boss

Bitch asking would I go buy her Bohemian
Pullinâ€™ on her Indian Remy
On the end Im a get that bit the business
