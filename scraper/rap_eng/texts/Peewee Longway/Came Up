Outta Space

[Hook: Ethan Sacii]
I done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
Snatch your main up, I done came up
50 band juug, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up

[Verse 1: Ethan Sacii]
I done came up, I done came up
Jumped up off the porch I got flavors
Your bitch watching me like its Cable
We got pots and pans on the table
Kick the pimp game like its Sega (oh)
Mix the yellow with the purple like the lakers
I'm in texas sippin' lean like a Ranger
Ethan Sacii killin' shit yall in danger

[Hook: Ethan Sacii]
I done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
Snatch your main up, I done came up
50 band juug, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
50 band jugg before I was a ending
Thats how a young nigga came trap in the trenches
Ain't gon go back and forth with you niggas
Pull up slammin' on the Forgis, smokin' keisha
Comin' up with that coco I whip Mona lisa
The price on the bricks what I want for my feature
I done came up, that ain't the reason I tote my banger
I ain't never been a motherfuckin' lame
You think I came up, don't reach for my chain
Hit a nigga with the Chief Keef bang bang
Remi diamonds on my not Johnny Dang
Caught a nigga wholesale water main
Bitch call the booking line for the dicking down

[Hook: Ethan Sacii]
I done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
Snatch your main up, I done came up
50 band juug, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up

[Verse 3: Ethan Sacii]
I done came up, bitch I'm flamed up
Choppa hit you in your back not your ankles
Sippin' lean out the pint I'm a drank up (lean)
Hit a lick for fifty racks bitch I'm a taker
I just kidnapped your bitch you can't save her
I'm in Houston eatin' steaks say my prayers
I be countin' up the money like a banker
Reporting live from the trap bitch I'm a banker

[Hook: Ethan Sacii]
I done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
Snatch your main up, I done came up
50 band juug, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up

[Verse 4: Ethan Sacii]
Trap, I done came up, I done came up (trap)
I got bad bitches switch your main up
You the type of nigga keep your chain tucked
I got automatic choppa
Sacii La Famill fuck the game up
Never trust a stomach we just train em
Diamond full of water need to drain em
I got hella hoes but I don't claim them

[Hook: Ethan Sacii]
I done came up, I done came up

Snatch your main up, I done came up
50 band juug, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
