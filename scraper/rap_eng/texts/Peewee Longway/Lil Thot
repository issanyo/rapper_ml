[Intro/Chorus: Larry League]
You gon' get caught serving with that lil' thot (With that lil' thot)
I be in the club you can watch them bills drop (Drop, drop)
Lil' thot, lil' thot
I'm just getting to that bag, I don't talk a lot (Hell nah)
You gon' get caught serving with that lil' thot (With that lil' thot)
I be in the club you can watch them bills drop (Drop, drop)
Lil' thot, lil' thot
I'm just getting to that bag, I don't talk a lot (Hell nah)

[Verse 1: SenseiATL]
Slept up in the trenches, now I'm covered in mud
Throws dubs all on that bitch cause that bitch a dub
If he run up on me make him drop like vertigo
With my convoy like Pablo, got the work boomin' like Metro
Chasing money you can catch me running routes
Hit a fucking stain left his pockets in a drought
Straight up off the dock (straight up off the dock, off the dock)
I just pulled that new foreign off the fucking lot

[Chorus: Larry League]
You gon' get caught serving with that lil' thot (With that lil' thot)
I be in the club you can watch them bills drop (Drop, drop)
Lil' thot, lil' thot
I'm just getting to that bag, I don't talk a lot (Hell nah)
You gon' get caught serving with that lil' thot (With that lil' thot)
I be in the club you can watch them bills drop (Drop, drop)
Lil' thot, lil' thot
I'm just getting to that bag, I don't talk a lot (Hell nah)

[Verse 2: Randy]
Candy paint my ride, bitch let me out that side
All these drugs in my system but you know I ain't prescribed
I might drop a rack like I'm in Iraq, your bitch gave me her heart I gave her a heart attack
Only got one fucking hit, now they fiends
Randy Suess, red pill, blue pill, purple bean
Randy Dairy Queen cause I keep the ice cream
And I'm all up in they eyes like Randy Visine
Cook a fucking pig like a luau, got hits like it's two outs
Too country on 2 south, serving cookie like a girl scout

[Verse 3: Larry]
I wear that gun just like a sweater, I don't know any better
You best be wrapping it up and making it look real nice when you sell it
Lil' thots at the Larry show cuz they sneak in the exit
Keep my eyes open for licks, yeah I can tell that he jealous

[Chorus: Larry League]
You gon' get caught serving with that lil' thot (With that lil' thot)
I be in the club you can watch them bills drop (Drop, drop)
Lil' thot, lil' thot
I'm just getting to that bag, I don't talk a lot (Hell nah)
You gon' get caught serving with that lil' thot (With that lil' thot)
I be in the club you can watch them bills drop (Drop, drop)
Lil' thot, lil' thot
I'm just getting to that bag, I don't talk a lot (Hell nah)

[Verse 4: PeeWee LongWay]
20 bands for my bracelet, got a dick inside the 40
Lulu in the 'rrari [?]
Drop them bands on the floor, paper cuts on that big body
Don't get caught up with that thotty, LongWay Larry League we geeked up on Scotty

Drop them bands on the floor saw your ankles on it
