Work that bitch, with the pots
You understand what I'm saying?

(Chorus/Hook)
Go work that bitch,(go work that bitch, go work them hoes)
Trap her house, I go bizerk
Go work that bitch,(go work that bitch, go work them hoes
Make that bitch go trap that work
Go work that bitch
She jumping on the pole like she jumping on a Dick
Go work that bitch,(go work that bitch, go work them hoes.)
Trap a house, I go bizerk
Work that bitch, go work that ho
Go Work that bitch,go work that ho
Just work that bitch, we work them hoes
Work that bitch
Trap out that bitch spot and go bizerk

(Verse 1)
I caught that little ho just the work at the spot
I make the lil ho sign her name on the box
I get to trapping and count up the knots
Fuck up the kitchen with the Pyrex pot
Can't wait to work a bitch I stay keep her pimping
Pull up in a ray, double park the Bentley
That boy right there look like a pretty penny
I work a lil bitch, yeah she like Mr Bentley
Make that bitch hold on this box in the trenches
I was Fucked up, the lil bad bitch in givenchy
Suzy Choose, she keep acting like she with it
I like her whole pussy spit out digits
Her kid sleeping on a ton of midget
Her son don't know she a son of a bitch
Bitch drunk and love but she ain't get the whole Dick
Pulled up in a Ross show, Mickey s(?)
Bitch eating up the dick, gave it hickey
Work that hen though
When the bitch get off the Dick she gotta go
Working back to back like its a demo
I Fuck them lil bitches, don't feel on them
Switcheroo the lil bitch, let her Fuck lil homie
Work a lil bitch before she think she got over
All on the trunk and the bitch back door


(Chorus/Hook)
Go work that bitch,(go work that bitch, go work them hoes)
Trap her house, I go bizerk
Go work that bitch,(go work that bitch, go work them hoes
Make that bitch go trap that work
Go work that bitch
She jumping on the pole like she jumping on a Dick
Go work that bitch,(go work that bitch, go work them hoes.)
Trap a house, I go bizerk
Work that bitch, go work that ho
Go Work that bitch,go work that ho
Just work that bitch, we work them hoes
Work that bitch
Trap out that bitch spot and go bizerk

(Verse 2)
Bitch got to count it before she get the dick
Trap out the spot make the bitch serve some nicks
Got her thumbing blue huninids till her fingers split
Whipping up coco(coco) banana splits
I go coco loco with the dummy bricks
Nasty dancers, doing tricks on a Dick
Watch how longway work this lil biddy bitch
Take a selfie with the new Apple 6
Let my new doors on my beamer 6
Got that ho scrambling eggs on number 6
Whip a pound right up out of a bitch
Make her wait, first 48 on a bitch
Put rapper weed in that, ho too high ever since
Trappin bizerk out that bitch ever since
Work that lil bitch got a stash in the vent
Longway Callaso I'm el calpo cunning(?)
Out in the trenches, they jumping the fence
Unless some bitch gonna want to repent
Christian bitches longway turned em hypocrite
Trap out that bitch for Christian Louboutin
Big homies they call me longway goomin
I got these Lil bitches Suzy choosin'
Working out the spot Brown boxing like we moving
I keep a lil bitch on duty.( Longway Bitch!)

(Chorus/Hook)
Go work that bitch,(go work that bitch, go work them hoes)
Trap her house, I go bizerk
Go work that bitch,(go work that bitch, go work them hoes
Make that bitch go trap that work
Go work that bitch
She jumping on the pole like she jumping on a Dick
Go work that bitch,(go work that bitch, go work them hoes.)
Trap a house, I go bizerk
Work that bitch, go work that go
Go Work that bitch,go work that ho
Just work that bitch, we work them hoes
Work that bitch
Trap out that bitch spot and go bizerk
