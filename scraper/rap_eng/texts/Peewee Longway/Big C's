[Hook: Jay Fizzle]
Blue flag, left side
Crip gang, bang
Big Glocks, long clips
We gon’, bang
No need for red beams
We got, aim
Blue flag, left side
Crip gang, bang
My niggas crippin’, never slippin’
Big pump, pistol grippin’
On grey street, cuz neighborhood
That’s a whole lot of C’s
Big C’s, blue team
I got my young niggas with extensions
Big C’s, blue team
I got my young niggas with extensions

[Verse 1: Jay Fizzle]
Blue chucks, purple flag
Hundred rounds on the draco
Dickies set on my ass
Locs move when I say so
Big grapes like cantaloupe
Nigga cut me, you see grape juice
All this purple on me
I got PeeWee with all this baby blue
Been gang banging since about two
Throwing hand-signs like I’m [?]
Young nigga with big choppers
In my drop top shooting out the roof
Hit ya nigga, home of the blues
You either win, you either lose
Riding ‘round with 100 youngins
Better pray to god they don’t shoot
In the neighborhood with the neighbor hoods
Rolling dice with the [?] sixty
Pouring six so I can’t miss it
Lil Fizzle just too crazy
Perfect aim, I ain’t missing
Sniper gang, long distance
Paper Route, MPA
That’s a whole lot of crips seein’ this

Big C’s, blue team

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Golden nigga, golden baby
Homicides on a shady 3-80, yeah
Cinnabuns on the Glock, baow
Neighborhood clip with the draco
Bright blue all my bitches
Bootleg my Buscemis
Fizzle great street with the crippin’
The S on my head for the sixty
Ain’t no hesitating with it
I masturbate the fucking trigger
A couple pillows in the ceiling
Hold his ass, blood [?]
They heard your screaming, they call a gang injunction
Slapping these bitches, they want the gang gang
My lil homie, I’m cripping and chain gang
Run up on you, close range, no aim
Send the blues to Jay, let’s count up these thangs
Then a C on these Cartier frames
Two double R like the front of the Phantom
Fizzle great like the Act in the Fanta
Little pocket with a blue bandana
The clip on the Draco bananas
Lock C with the crips in the grave
Pyrus gon’ pull up at the wake
Neighborhood let dope with the drakes
