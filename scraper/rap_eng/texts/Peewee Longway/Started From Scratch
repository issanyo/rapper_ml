[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I left the game for the OG
They say their life's a gamble
The dough game chose me
Ain't shit that I can't handle
The robbers they are lurking
Keep choppers with bananas
The cover ain't by counting
And I ain't trying to hit never
Started from scratch [x17]

[Verse 1: Duke]
I built this shit from scratch
Now I'm on fire like somebody got struck a match
I'm an arsonist, I need some gasoline
No Double XL I hit 'em with that magazine
Running through that Charlie Sheen
Christian Loub look like I walked over a murder scene
Lame man nigga practice on your run skills
Put a fork in it, cause if a gun deal
MPA the count we move like the mob move
It ain't the stuff crust when we mob move
I grew up with killers, younglings and them OG's
Tryin' to fit in and the dope ain't cali

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I left the game for the OG

Ain't shit that I can't handle

Started from scratch [x17]

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Painted picture they demolish the invention
I tried to make it to a picture
Them birds flying the drought
They land in the south
We all wrap 'em like prison and show 'em up
What you working with, that turk layer
You wantin more, they in the refrigerator
Cap the cat ass nigga, impersonator
I know you're the fierce, you're white as tiger
Want a chicken box I got that bojanga
Fish scared jumping out the water
This shit overrated
You want that cookie, I got that famous amous
I started from scratch ye nigga I made it

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]

[Verse 3: PeeWee Longway]
Young lil nigga on this gruesome fucking dollars
Scratching at the pack I'm reconnecting with the gualas
The OG 's always said get money learn to hit some
You in the land of some goblins
No problem you murder something
When you spray make sure its clear, Thirty Eight Revolver
These niggas ain't as real as you think, Life is a gamble
This cold when you mentioning work, they wear antennas
Come from the bottom and the dirt
You're rich and looking for skirts for the work
No Chris for the plug, 10 different zip codes needed
MPA band camp feeding
They work and never out of speed
Out again when they get it across the line
Head on with the bull on my grind
Hey man I signed the dotted line

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I left the game for the OG
They say their life's a gamble
The dough game chose me
Ain't shit that I can't handle
The robbers they are lurking
Keep choppers with bananas
The cover ain't by counting

Started from scratch [x17]
