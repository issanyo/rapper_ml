[Chorus]
I know why Martin Luther King had a dream
Couldn’t understand it why we serve the fiends
They couldn’t hold me down like Coretta King
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King
Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, yeah
I know why Martin Luther King had a dream
Couldn’t understand it why we serve the fiends
They couldn’t hold me down like Coretta King
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King
Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm still the street, we let freedom ring
Gotta do right by your king and queen
Pick a book of my Coretta King
Make it come together drop the Billy Jean
Got a clear understanding why we serve the fiends
Traphouse jumping like Jordan on the southside
Let freedom ring (ring ring ring) I go Mississippi with the drippy
On the politician hypocrisy
I got Donald Trump up in the kitchen
Obama bud up in the vacuum sealer
Uncle Sam still taxin' niggas
Al Sharpton still pressin'
Coppin fifteen for them vests
They pullin' Rodney King arrests
We out here young and we restless
Trying to get a bigger bomb, get to Mexico
Yea my queen the bomb in Coretta dresses
Yeah they gave me an inch and I took a mile
Walk around the town with my besties
I’ma wear the crown when I’m restless
Yeah the black lives matter wear
Trying to bring it back together
While the white pipe down

[Chorus]
I know why Martin Luther King had a dream
Couldn’t understand it why we serve the fiends
They couldn’t hold me down like Coretta King
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King
Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, yeah
I know why Martin Luther King had a dream
Couldn’t understand it why we serve the fiends
They couldn’t hold me down like Coretta King
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King
Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hate is to great a burden for you to bear
AIn't nothing more dangerous than ignorance
Thats the king in the laboratory
Water whipping, I had all my dreams from a pint of lean
Fell asleep cooking work over whole things
My mama raised me like Coretta King
My daddy locked up in the chain gang
Ain’t got no one to point at, play blame games
American Baptist minister with Actavis
Stacking up benjamins, flipping those packages
I had a dream, one day little four babies turned into a nina
Go back to Mississippi, back to Alabama
Back to South Carolina, back to Georgia
Back to Louisiana, slums in the ghetto
Get them bums out the water
I got a dream, let freedom ring from Cali, New York
Colorado Rockies, trap out the porch
My Mexican plug, they tried to deport him, woah
We bringin' it back 'cross the border
I married his sister and daughter
I might just go big in Nevada, yeah
The rap and trap started on MARTA, yeah, ayy
I do the trap shit for my daughter
No father but worried about my mama
Used to struggle, just keep it one hundred with you
My momma taught me to be father figure
I got soldiers but much on the front line
I got hungry but learned how to hunt mine
I got J's tryna swipe through the punch line
Longway bitch

[Chorus]
I know why Martin Luther King had a dream
Couldn’t understand it why we serve the fiends
They couldn’t hold me down like Coretta King
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King
Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, yeah
I know why Martin Luther King had a dream
Couldn’t understand it why we serve the fiends
They couldn’t hold me down like Coretta King
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King
Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, yeah
