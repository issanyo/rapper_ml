[Intro]
Ask me how I'm geeked up bitch you know it
When I walk up out that front door, grab that blower
Don't ask how I'm geeked up bitch you know it
When I walk up out my front door,grab that blower

(Pre-Chorus)
I start my day off in the morning selling drugs
Fore I walk up out the door I grab that blower
It's a beautiful day in the hood to sell these drugs

[Hook]
I'm the motherfuckin connect and the plug
Shout lil thug, shout lil thug, shout lil thug
Shout lil thug, shou lil thug, shout lil thug
I'm the motherfuckin connect and the plug
Shout lil thug, shout lil thug, shout lil thug
Shout lil thug, shou lil thug, shout lil thug

[Verse 1]
Came up on the block slanging drugs
Shout lil thug
Big 'ol gun in my britches
No strap no trap in the trenches
They think I fax tha pack how fast I send it
Peewee Longway back-to-back in business
Due to the fact that I'm thumbing Benjamin's
Got a traphouse door beatin off the hinges
Two bandos called Mr Williams gotta Carbon 15 my new security
VVS Diamond.. Burr
Take a nine out the brick look like chandeliers
Work the dNope
I'm the connect, the plug you can find me on Google
Riding round juggin in the Uber
With a pint of High Tech, call it Sudafed
Longway Chapo Guzman
VVS Diamond
Burr!

[Pre-Chorus]
I start my day off in the morning selling drugs
Fore I walk up out the door I grab that blower
It's a beautiful day in the hood to sell these drugs

[Hook]
I'm the motherfuckin connect and the plug
Shout lil thug, shout lil thug, shout lil thug
Shout lil thug, shou lil thug, shout lil thug
I'm the motherfuckin connect and the plug
Shout lil thug, shout lil thug, shout lil thug
Shout lil thug, shou lil thug, shout lil thug

[Verse 2]
Bitch hopped of the porch and did 4 for the judgeâ€¦
Hop on the banana boat for the bud
My mama always said lil shorty was a thug
Invest the blue Benjamin's all on drugs
I learned the chemistry cooking up
Arm and hammer learned the double up
Break a nick off the brick, your auntie will wake up
Handing out tussins I start my day up
Hit the door with a chopper, AK in my car
When I start my day off, I be ready for war
Ran all that cake on my toe it bizarre
Blue Bandana on my head, 2Pac Shakur
It's a beautiful day to get a bitch a bar
Drop the top on the Aston
Look how my shit start
(Longway Bitch!)

[Pre-Chorus]
I start my day off in the morning selling drugs
Fore I walk up out the door I grab that blower
It's a beautiful day in the hood to sell these drugs

[Hook]
I'm the motherfuckin connect and the plug
Shout lil thug, shout lil thug, shout lil thug
Shout lil thug, shou lil thug, shout lil thug
I'm the motherfuckin connect and the plug
Shout lil thug, shout lil thug, shout lil thug
Shout lil thug, shou lil thug, shout lil thug
I'm the motherfuckin connect and the plug
Shout lil thug, shout lil thug, shout lil thug
Shout lil thug, shou lil thug, shout lil thug
