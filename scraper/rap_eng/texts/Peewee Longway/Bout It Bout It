Gotta be 'bout it
Cook that shit up, Quay
Gotta be 'bout it
Gotta be 'bout it
I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Gotta be 'bout it, 'bout it
Gotta be 'bout it, 'bout it
Bitch, I'm 'bout it, 'bout it

[Chorus]
She say she fuckin' on me tonight
Gonna suck on that D with ice, ayy
Pussy nice and tight tonight
Doin' up brain and pipe
Said she 'bout it
Lil' bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Oh is you 'bout it?
Lil' bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Yeah, killin' the pussy

Lil' bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Lil' bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it

[Verse 1]
Young bitch thinkin' I'm from 'luminati
Deposit I made in my closet
At random I posed the body
Yeah, the FN I catch me a body (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
Bodies on bodies
Got bodies on bodies, got bodies on bodies, yeah
Don't tell nobody
Don't tell nobody, don't tell nobody, yeah
Get booted up, pull up and pipe her
Catch a body like I'm a real lifer (Boom)
In the city like I'm the dice
Take a gamble, come play with your life
Is you 'bout it? (Is you 'bout it?)
Bitch, I'm 'bout it, 'bout it (I'm 'bout it, 'bout it)
That Rol' on my wrist, that Lil Yachty (Ice)
Beat the pussy like Mr. Miyagi
They make crack like, they fill pack like, then like Master P we wanna jugg
Findin' bodies, catchin' bodies way 'fore Boyz n the Hood (Uh)
Fuck the 12 here and the chop hop us up there
And that 4-4 they keep on the shelves (Whoa)
I'm gonna fuck on that ho, ain't gonna tell

[Chorus]
She say she fuckin' on me tonight
Gonna suck on that D with ice, ayy
Pussy nice and tight tonight
Doin' up brain and pipe
Said she 'bout it
Lil' bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Oh is you 'bout it?
Lil' bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Yeah, killin' the pussy
Bitch I got bodies on bodies
Yeah, cook it up, cook it up
Bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it ('Bout it, yeah)
'Bout it, 'bout it
Lil' bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Lil' bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Lil' bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it

[Verse 2]
Roll up a blunt of exotic
Pull up and fuck it, no coughin'
She suck on the D, need a rubber
That pussy be drippin' like water
Yeah, she came out of Canada
She fresh off a banana boat
No Tony Montana (Yeah, yeah)
Made that bitch eat a cantaloupe (Eat it up, eat it up)
Put that boot in her bootyhole
Make her leak out her panties (Leak, leak)
Lil' bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it (Oh, is you 'bout it)
Got dick like a Xanny (Yeah)
I fuck from the back with a cannon
Lil' mama got nipple like Janet
On Super Bowl winnin' all Grammys
In the kitchen I trap like the candy
Oh is you 'bout it?
I'm poppin' a Perc while she panic
When she busts she do it dramatic
Got a 4-4 that shoot automatic
Got them Benjamins stacked for your habits
Dolce Gabbana just dabbin'
Make her spit on the dick, make it nasty
Make her spit on the dick, make it nasty

[Chorus]
She say she fuckin' on me tonight
Gonna suck on that D with ice, ayy
Pussy nice and tight tonight
Doin' up brain and pipe
Said she 'bout it
Lil' bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Oh is you 'bout it?
Lil' bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Yeah, killin' the pussy
Bitch I got bodies on bodies
Yeah, cook it up, cook it up
Bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it ('Bout it, yeah)
'Bout it, 'bout it
Lil' bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Lil' bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Lil' bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
