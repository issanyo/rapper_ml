[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
They say Gucci rap about drugs, want to boycott
Got your baby mama in my condo with boy shorts
Just another nigga with a gun, you’s a toy car
Gucci man, I murder tricks for fun, make your heart stop
And my real name is Gucci Mane, but Guwop is my alias
1017 Brick Squad Records, and we are the most hated clique
Scrape 8 bodies, killed it and dumped it on 26
Your little girl, but she 26 and damn little mama ate a bit
They say I’m violent but I’m the shit, I call it irony

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
This OG weed I got it lit, I call it ivy
PeeWee Longway you the shit, the OG weed supplier
Boys in the hood sell anything for profit
Boon up on the mileage, selling bands in the ‘rari
MPA and 1017 I heard them niggas goblin[?]
Wrap you up like gyro, sipping mud out the styro
Foam, two cups got me gone, two red bitches I fuck on
When I’m geeked up in my zone, LONGWAY LONGWAY

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
1017, we America’s most wanted
And we gon serve these drugs to whoever damn want it
Yeah you know it’s that A-1, when you see our stamp on it
Making plays off the white, lean, and the marijuana (juug)
If you run up on the squad, boy you know that you’s a goner
Got questions bout the squad, just go ask your baby mama
This squad gon have it locked for the next ten summers
Sipping mud, rolling up OG that come from Humboldt

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Smoking Cali weed, stupid OG on my last B
Trap House on a dead end, fuck a cash freak
I got this pretty little tender on me, she just 23
She going deep, she catch a bomb a week, that’s 400 G’s
Pimping, call me macaroni cheese cause I hang with these
Baby say that Gucci Mane mean, ash tray out of weed
Gang sticky as a swisher sweet that I drink with lean
Boston caught me down a half a mil and it’s plain jane
Leaning, dreaming, took a nap woke up in Phoenix
Geeking, tripping, someone please take me to Neiman’s
Schemin', skeeting, leaving semen, need to clean it
Tricking, treating, don’t know you sleeping with the demon

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
1017, we America’s most wanted
And we gon serve these drugs to whoever damn want it
Yeah you know it’s that A-1, when you see our stamp on it
Making plays off the white, lean, and the marijuana (juug)
If you run up on the squad, boy you know that you’s a goner
Got questions bout the squad, just go ask your baby mama
This squad gon have it locked for the next ten summers
Sipping mud, rolling up OG that come from Humboldt

[Verse 4: Jose Guapo]
Got a big cup of mud, making plays off all these drugs
Got Longway with me and he say he ready to rob the plug
I can get your ass shot by sending a text message to Thug
Show up to your show, you know we gon shoot up the club
Cross the border, the place I order, diamonds on water
Your baby mama miley slaughter, don’t have to force her
Sending packs across the water, come place your order
Diamond bricks we buy from Florida, take back to Georgia
Brick Squad we the hit, score plug and hit for
Mamba weed, hit a lick for it, wrong clique boy
Break it down and serve whoever want it, got the streets hooked, don’t it
El Capitan, Big Guwop my homie, that’s 100

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
1017, we America’s most wanted
And we gon serve these drugs to whoever damn want it
Yeah you know it’s that A-1, when you see our stamp on it
Making plays off the white, lean, and the marijuana (juug)
If you run up on the squad, boy you know that you’s a goner
Got questions bout the squad, just go ask your baby mama
This squad gon have it locked for the next ten summers
Sipping mud, rolling up OG that come from Humboldt
