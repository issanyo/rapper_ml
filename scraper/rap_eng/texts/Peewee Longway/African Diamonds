[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
Spent the fifty on my right wrist and that bitch ain’t even a rollie
Spent the fifty on my left wrist and that bitch right there bipolar
Diamonds from Africa, Diamonds from Africa, Diamonds from Africa
Spent the fifty for Ms. Pinky, boogers in my pinky ring
Spent a fifty for the Fruity Pebbles in the bezel, now they call the boy "Bling Bling"
Diamonds from Africa, Diamonds from Africa, Diamonds from Africa
Diamonds from Africa, Diamonds from Africa, Diamonds from Africa
Diamonds from Africa, Diamonds from Africa, Diamonds from Africa

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Akon boogers in my pinky ring
Two blue face rollies on my wrist, Siamese
Iced out my bezel with a fifty piece
Serving Bobby Brown and Whitney
Lean still going in my kidney
Peacock diamonds on all of my bitches
Yeah they go hard in the kitchen (in the kitchen with me)
Can you hear me now? Diamonds in my ear
Bitch don’t wanna fuck with no queer
Turn that bitch on to real VV chandeliers
Nigerian trafficker, Diamonds from Africa
Giuseppe zebras on my feet, it's a shocker
Bitch, I'm a trapper turned rapper
Kitchen with the gas, throwing away to brick wrap
Still with it to get a nigga kidnapped
Put a bundle of blue hundreds on a nigga's fitted cap
The shit on my wrist make them go crazy stoned
Looking like he got beat by Moses Malone
Fugazi Cubans in your Cuban link
Boy, your jeweler must be making diamonds at home
Hell is you doing, the fuck is you on?
Sun's outside, got clouds in your stones
Spent a fifty on your wrist and that shit ain't a rollie
But they tricked your ass out a whole lotta guacamole

Diamonds from Africa, Diamonds from Africa, Diamonds from Africa
Diamonds from Africa, Diamonds from Africa, Diamonds from Africa
Diamonds from Africa, Diamonds from Africa, Diamonds from Africa

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Giuseppe stepping in safari
Just jumped off the plane, hopped in the Rari
Diamonds dropping in a tropical forest
My life's like a movie, Jumanji, Jumanji
Came a long way from jugging onions
Respect the gadget double R coming
With so many dead guys in my duffle
Nigga better go call the Ghostbusters
I ain’t even had to say nothing
She looked at my watch and she know I hustle
Damn, nigga, I feel sorry for you
Your bitch on my line and I ain’t gon' fuck her
Thugging, no trusting and no loving
My neck and my watch is custom
I’m the socket, I go around plugging
Your niggas that come to your hood and start dumping
So many diamonds, I look like a rapper
Me and PeeWee, we go see the ambassador
Come back with bricks, bales, strong
Nigga, you be flexing like a wrestler
Diamonds came in and they nasty
Rocking Margiela, Givenchy, that fashion
Got my neighbors, they harrassing
It keeps me we throwing away the brick wrappers
