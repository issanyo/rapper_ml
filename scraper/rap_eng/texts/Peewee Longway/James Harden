[Intro]
I'ma pimp this ho, man
ATL Jacob
My ho, man, had to pimp my next bitch
Mhm
That boy Cassius
Ayy

[Chorus]
Shouts out to my old ho, I had to pimp my next bitch
Cooked up old my old stove, Henny with my lil' fish
Stretch it, James Harden, I'm fresh at every press
Switch up on my bomb, got me juggin' with the Mexicans
Sackin' up like it groceries, the mops out like custodians
I'ma backdoor the bitch like Jodie, I'ma flex on the ho with the Rollie
Want smoke? Ridin' 'round with the smoke pole
Back to back, jump out them four-doors
My shooters on boot and the Quaalude
I'ma pull up and do it today

[Verse 1]
I already know how we playin'
We cook up in pots and pans
I load up a bop with Xans
I send 'em on my command
We flippin' and juggin' the strand
In the bucket, a buck with the gas
Fuckin' a thot with the bands
The pointers on top of my Rolly
Hold on, ho, fuck is you sayin'? Cut my stove on
Pull up on me, lil' bitch, all my dough gone
Come kick my styrofoam, cuff that ho like Don Juan
Cookin' the dope with my left arm
40-Glock gon' get you stepped on
I'm sippin' the deuce in the Jones
Sixty pointers in the stones
VV's, they jump out the charm
She suckin' me, give me the dome
I play Russian roulette with the chrome
She put coke on her tongue and her gums
She wake up and traffic the bomb
I'm Osama bin Laden with them guns

[Chorus]
Shouts out to my old ho, I had to pimp my next bitch
Cooked up old my old stove, Henny with my lil' fish
Stretch it, James Harden, I'm fresh at every press
Switch up on my bomb, got me juggin' with the Mexicans
Sackin' up like it groceries, the mops out like custodians
I'ma backdoor the bitch like Jodie, I'ma flex on the ho with the Rollie
Want smoke? Ridin' 'round with the smoke pole
Back to back, jump out them four-doors
My shooters on boot and the Quaalude
I'ma pull up and do it today

[Verse 2]
My shooters on boot and the Quaalude
Banana clip, thirty with hollows
Chop a brick like a Nakato, yeah
Sippin' that Ecat Moscato, yeah
Forgi crawlin' through the pothole
How much dope can your lil' pot hold?
Colombian print at the Scotty nose
We slicin' the pizza like Azio's
Workin' the bitch out her pantyhose
Twenty-one bag of the indo (Gas)
Gusher, buster, sippin' on 'Tussin
Thirty-eight slow, might be restin', yeah
Run up my number like Dutchie
Pop out the roof while you clutchin'
Add a dick in the drum just like fuck it
Let the stick come and cut you like churches
Yeah, them hammers got turbulence
She bring it back tucked in her girdle
I only fuck her when she fertile
I re-rock a brick with the Gerber
I'm sippin' on lean, I'm servin'
I go scuba divin' for the sherbert
Make and break, a new face on the shirt
Break your knees and your heels when you work, work that bitch

[Chorus]
Shouts out to my old ho, I had to pimp my next bitch
Cooked up old my old stove, Henny with my lil' fish
Stretch it, James Harden, I'm fresh at every press
Switch up on my bomb, got me juggin' with the Mexicans
Sackin' up like it groceries, the mops out like custodians
I'ma backdoor the bitch like Jodie, I'ma flex on the ho with the Rollie
Want smoke? Ridin' 'round with the smoke pole
Back to back, jump out them four-doors
My shooters on boot and the Quaalude
I'ma pull up and do it today (Now)
