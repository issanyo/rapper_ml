[Chorus]
There’s too much touch and bust out here
Can’t trust nothin but my Glock out here
Fuck boy crooked cops out here
Maggot rats and thots out here
Put snakes all on my Gucci Gucci
2FN tucked in my garment
5.7 Straight through your temple
Doo, doo, doo, through your body armor
Stepped on, do what you cut
Stepped on, do too much cut
Stepped on, you know that you cut
Stepped on, you know that you cut

[Verse 1]
Fuckboy get put in a rerock machine
Arm n hamma Isotol make it three
Glock with the 30 curl buzzard beaters
Mr Blue Benjamin Egg Beater
Ask for the ghost i pull up do the most
Fuckboy extensions we preach holy ghost
We get 30 stick go door to door with it
I go Rocky Balboa go toe to toe with it
( boom boom bow bow )
Yea Lux shit still cut throat with it ( neighborhood )
2 F & N with no co defendant
Longway crossin no such sense of Crippen
Double G buckle put Flex on my 50
Double G blue duffles Double blue Bentley
Trapping with robbers and the snakes with the venom
Maggots and thots they rats chasin blue cheese
Got to much cut gonna touch in bust
Your bitch got bigger nuts than you
No 50 we give it 100 percent
I’m pluggin I never do 90 percent
Residue Rollie Residue my bitch
Pour out the paint get a suck out the rent
Gelato puffin with the 30 extension
Catch a bitch and put a stick outta window (Longway bitch)

[Chorus]
There’s too much touch and bust out here
Can’t trust nothin but my Glock out here
Fuck boy crooked cops out here
Maggot rats and thots out here
Put snakes all on my Gucci Gucci
2FN tucked in my garment
5.7 Straight through your temple
Doo, doo, doo through your body armor
Stepped on, do what you cut
Stepped on, do too much cut
Stepped on, you know that you cut
Stepped on, you know that you cut

[Verse 2]
Dope water whip weight weigh too much
Stepped on, cut, weight way too much
20 blue tips in an FN clip got two tucked in my Gucci Belt
Don't trust nothing but them Glocks
Don't trust that bitch with my box
Doom Doom Doom yellow tape 5 5 News Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Back that truck up. Work, work work
Hit em with the stick he on a t-shirt
Look fuckboy bitch really really need a skirt
Two twin kids tech with the blue ray
Hit em in the crew neck, get the Boosie Fade
Doom doom doom doom doom doom doom
Gotta keep one cocked two three pistols
Niggas snitching like cell casings
Never leave a hoe another baby
Pull up parking with a smoke hold
Longway on top of the dope hold
IT brick good coke hold
Chop a brick , get a roll, go 4 4
Finding real get petrol, flippin burger like the zesto
Trust my Glock before my kin folk
Fuck the D.A. no vaca close ( Longway Bitch )

[Chorus]
There’s too much touch and bust out here
Can’t trust nothin but my Glock out here
Fuck boy crooked cops out here
Maggot rats and thots out here
Put snakes all on my Gucci Gucci
2FN tucked in my garment
5.7 Straight through your temple
Doo, doo, doo through your body armor
Stepped on, do what you cut
Stepped on, do too much cut
Stepped on, you know that you cut
Stepped on, you know that you cut
