[Interlude 2x: Peewee Longway]
Bitch been gone all night, she been with me
She ain't gon' have no alibi
Bitch been gone all night, she been with me
She ain't gon' have no alibi

[Hook: Peewee Longway]
Got a nigga main bitch takin' dick
Got anotha' nigga bitch with the shit
I got anotha' nigga bitch tag a boot
I got anotha' nigga bitch switcharoo
This bitch, with the shit, that's my bitch
Yo bitch, ain't yo bitch, that's my bitch
Take a bitch, flip a bitch, that's my shit
You can't Leave yo bitch around me, I'm hirin'

[Verse 1: Peewee Longway]
Hundred bands in my pocket, you can see that I'm loaded
European clothin', tailor made for me only
Alligator giuseppe made for me and me only
Got ya bitch sprayin in the bed, me and me only

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Trap spot buggin', it's just me and me only
Same spot doin' numbers, it's just me and my homie
When I was broke, who was there? It was me and me only
She surf around on that meat like a piece of bologna
She reach fa' what she wanted, that car you drive you lease for the moment
Every car I drive boy I own it, every time I'm high you can tell that it's on me
Walk by, they smell it on me
Talk like the killas on me
The boss life, I live it, homie
Work for my parents and children only

[Hook: Peewee Longway]
This bitch, with the shit, that's my bitch
Yo bitch, ain't yo bitch, that's my bitch
Take a bitch, flip a bitch, that's my shit
You can't leave yo bitch around me, I'm hirin'

[Verse 3: Peewee Longway]
My swagger too dope I'm walking, I'm a dealer guiseppe
Took a nigga main bitch and turned her to Becky
I be the freshest, VV my necklace , European tailor made for me and me only
Yo baby mama so addicted, get yo broke ass on
I front her two bands of strong, set up shop at yo home
Wrap up the box and it's gone, no signature from me on it
Took yo bitch she wit the shit, she head splits for me only

[Verse 4: Rich Homie Quan]
You ain't have no alibi
I've been gon' for three days, but I can't tell' em why
I've been movin nothing but that weight call it exercise
Like telling on your partner gets you less of time
Thinking he came for your support that nigga testified
[?]
I still fuck with the hood I could run him over
Top drop, in a foreign car, bitch don't tell me no
Drop cop in a hotbox, yea I'm runnin over every nigga in front of me
Can't duplicate, only one of me
Got a stupid face, made a hundred G's
In two days it ain't take a week
Five Rolexs' wasting time on it
Broke nigga paint a picture keep your eyes on him

[Hook: Peewee Longway]
This bitch, with the shit, that's my bitch
Yo bitch, ain't yo bitch, that's my bitch
Take a bitch, flip bitch, that's my shit
You can't Leave yo bitch around me, I'm hirin'

[Verse 5: Peewee Longway]
Juggin' gas bags and Peruvian blocks
Da Vinci chinchilla got specially made from a fox
Two hundred bands I had to drop for my top
Only one I got from whippin extras up out the pot
She said I'm [?] so I bought a yacht to park in the lot
Yea you're bitch a [?] I told that ho to fire up the pot
2Pac I got the juice [?]
Hundred and one dalmatians Guiseppes a hundred a spot

[Verse 6: Rich Homie Quan]
Heat up the pot, feds creepin', sneakin', and watchin'
I'm geekin' on Scotty, nigga know me and Peewee we bout it
Aye we bout it, aye we bout it
Aye we bout it we bout it we bout it
Tell them niggas we bout it, tell them niggas, tell them niggas
We bout it, we bout it, we bout it, we bout it, we bout it, we bout it
Tell them niggas we bout it
