[Intro: PeeWee Longway]
I be on that trap shit, selling bags

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
I be on that trap shit, selling bags
She ask me what I'm stepping in, bitch, that's a bag
I got a new bankroll, bitch, selling bags
I ain't trying to serve you, nigga, unless you buying bags
I be on that trap shit, selling bags
Ask me what I'm stepping in, bitch, that's a bag
I got a new bankroll, bitch, selling bags
I ain't trying to serve you, nigga, unless you buying bags, bags, bags

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
34, Herschel Walker, I want for my bags
Run them things across the border and keep candy for cash
Pissy-smelling bags, running from the tags
Jump up out the rafter, new Covalin's on they ass
Residential Rollie blue, the bezel full of ice
Fucked around and bust my Jeffrey bag, I got too many spikes
Let me just say I look nice
Balenciaga cost a pint
I'm just being real frank, little nigga
Blue Benjamins in the bank
Dope on my Margiela, Eddie Kane
Beverly Hills, I'm with Hillary Banks
We smoking cherry pie with Uncle Phil
On the west coast, dressed in a bag
I'm worth them M&Ms, camera be flashing
Longway be trapping and dabbing
Givenchy flavor like [?]
I got it off serving them bags

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
I be on that trap shit, selling bags
She ask me what I'm stepping in, bitch, that's a bag
I got a new bankroll, bitch, selling bags
I ain't trying to serve you, nigga, unless you buying bags
I be on that trap shit, selling bags
Ask me what I'm stepping in, bitch, that's a bag
I got a new bankroll, bitch, selling bags
I ain't trying to serve you, nigga, unless you buying bags, bags, bags

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I'm the bag man, ask your old lady
Better update it, I'm dressed in the latest
Margiela Maison, they think it's a painting
Feds chasing me, they say I'm a racist
Gucci my Rolex, they say I'm two-faced
A thousand bags in a secret location
Don't talk on the phone, you know how we facing
Give a whole bag to my African
Bags in the Audi, I'm trafficking
She don't ask to do backwards flips
Linebacker, I'll go tackle the bricks
Kicking the box, catching my drift
Kick it in Beverly Hills like the Fresh Prince
Greyhound, bags under the bench
Right by the border, throw it over the fence

[Verse 3: Diego Dose]
I catch it and run it
I'm spilling and tripping, I offer them bags
New Giuseppe, no stepping in the whole bag, bitch
I'm drinking a band
I offer them bales
We dumping the seal, you come with the cash and drop where you live
Designer my pimping, I'm kicking my shit in Rodeo
Chanel for the bitches, Givenchy ain't even a day old
When the [?] land, got a trap house full of kush band
Mail man, I swear to God, he my best friend

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
I be on that trap shit, selling bags
She ask me what I'm stepping in, bitch, that's a bag
I got a new bankroll, bitch, selling bags
I ain't trying to serve you, nigga, unless you buying bags
I be on that trap shit, selling bags
Ask me what I'm stepping in, bitch, that's a bag
I got a new bankroll, bitch, selling bags
I ain't trying to serve you, nigga, unless you buying bags, bags, bags
