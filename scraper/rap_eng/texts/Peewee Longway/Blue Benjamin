I switch my bitches with the homie with the switcharoo
I wrapped the brick up, served the dummy with the switcharoo
Out with the old, in with the new
Still stacking money, all my hundreds blue
The blue benjamin x8

[Verse 1]
Thumbin through the benjamin's
Paper cuts all on my tips
Servin bags of gas - (Good Gas!)
Switcharoo right in the Jag
MPA jefe I got on my tag
All of my bitches like, I dream of Genie
All of My bitches are bad, suckin' my dick while I'm swervin' the Lamborghini
Switcharoo whips on they ass
200, digital dash
Peruvian cocaine
Hand me the pot and the beater and I'm whippin' cake
Ana Mae, million dollar, trap spot in the A
Young nigga's shoulder strappin AK's
Too cool, [?]
Killin' the image of [?]
My dick in two bitches they know my name
Longway hefner, now they know my name
The blue benjamin, the blue M&M
I'm rubba-band rackin' em' everyday
A different pack comin in from the bay
You little bitty bitch, I'm a dealer
PeeWee longway done fucked all types of race
You little bitty bitch, I'm a flipper


[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got them old hundreds
New ones the way
Young and road runnin'
Servin' white yay
Bitch bite bay
Guess she might, hey
Ew, I think she likes me, yeah she might, aye
Them blue benjamins, I'm tellin that bitch that I'm gettin' it in, (work)
Toastin' lean like hen when the pint come in
Bat-cam on my Benz, smack-cam I'm a pimp, bitch
Wipe down my Margiela's, fuck her like Kesha
On belly, she young and she ready
Switch that bitch up with the camp
Tell that bitch longway gone vamp
I'm Michael Vick fuckin' with falcons now I got eagles
A big dog like me very rare
VVS diamonds, that make you just stare
Look at them punters lookin just like stunna, ice, bling bling
In the winter or summer
I'm on Comcast, I'm on so many channels
