[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Longway Juggin serving catching plays in the rental
Cooking pies fifths and plates
Serving all breakfast lunch and dinner dinner
Vato I tie you up and take it
Got the same brick back off in a rental
Clicks for kilometers in different staes
Take your land out the prick
I'm a boss big ass, queezin' on her titties
I ain't trying to lay up I'm a swear I'mma slam dunk in it
ATL love in my city cost my friend nigga my attendance
Keep talking out loud I see you a sprinter
Ya'll nigga 13 then I come kill 'em
The padre got the same Boston George Vision
Racks in the box, stack to the ceiling
I heard you got the thing wrapped in the kitchen
Southern calls born coming I ain't chilling
I'm the public enemy call me John Dillenger

Changing your color what you banging buddy
Got a band roll on me full of dough
