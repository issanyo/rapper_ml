[Verse 1: Peewee Longway]
I’m the plug for High performance marijuana
Wrap it up and shoot about three pointer from Tijuana
Four, Five boxes touch, I like my racks and hundreds
100 percent OG Gas, twerkin’ on the calculator, servin’ up the Glad Bag
My whips panoramic with the band camp
Hurricane Rollie off the blue face
Juggin’ the fuck out them bales
Fishscale done fucked up my scale
Still tracking my packs on the Dell
Spray the mac on his ass, give him hell
Got another nigga’s bitch calling my Benjamins.(?)
Silly bitch trying to add up my dividends
Count all the sandwich bags and the scale
Overnight packages in the mail
Them tacos is from Migos but not from Dale.(Bricks!)
Serve all your people, your clientele
I’m the cheapest with reefer, they strapped on the hill
Trappin’ with young niggas, ready to kill
Sniffin’ they fuck yo bitch right on her heel.(?)
She went for the crip and blue hundreds

[Verse 2: Peewee Longway]
Paper cuts all at the tips of my hand, thumbing’ through them new blue Benjamins
Flipping them bales indoors out the trap-house, talapia fish we cookin’
So many narcs you get shookin’, Move in the dark you get tookin’
That’s for them niggas screamin’ they bookin’..Longway, State-to-state with the paint juggin’
(woop)Skrrr! Skrr! Sound of the Pyrex when the water whippin’
Bitch you trippin’, bricks  Scottie Pippen. You know how many bags I sell in my kitchen?
Carlos done had this serving the midget, I fuck with never, because big (?)’s an OGeezy
Double my digits, stay down in the trenches. Sandwich bags and the scales got me suspicious
Fucking different nigga’s main bitches. Polo Boxers don’t wear Hanes britches
Trappin’ and dappin’(?), just staining bitches. Wrist game insane when I’m in the kitchen
Black Rubber band coming through the Benjamin(?), Just murdered the trap someone call forensics
Sandwich bags and scales how I’m livin’
Givenchy Safari, Cover my P..

[Verse 3: Offset]
Big face Benjamin, Plug ‘em in Berlin
Strung out with the ruley(?) on molly I’m nervous
No Omarion, but I be servin’, Got a bitch with a brick in Birkin
Hit the plug with the switcheroo, yellow diamond lookin’ like Pikachu
Double R Ghost nigga peekaboo
Sandwich my bag, remixing the gas. I’m on the planet I got jet lag
Raised the streets cause I didn’t have  a dad
On the highway on Actavis, hope I don’t crash
I am no Jason, I run with no mask
Migos Gang, MPA giving toe-tags
Niggas is fake, and we whipping the cake
Betty Crocker round my way
Niggas, they listen to Offset, they do what I say
I am the Migos sensei
Juggin’ them bales, they come to your place
Peewee Longway, he my nigga, my ace
We is some bosses, so stay in your place
All these gold bottles, we not playing spades
Your trappers like roaches my niggas goin’ Raid
Red Diamonds, my cross, it look like (?)versais
You and your niggas not on the same page
You run up on me, I hit you with the gauge
