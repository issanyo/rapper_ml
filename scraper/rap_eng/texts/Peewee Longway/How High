[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I Start my day on 3 different drugs, Molly, Gas, and Lean
I Start my day on 3 different drugs, Molly, Gas, and Lean

Yeah we trappin' geeked the fuck up, on Molly, Gas, and Lean
Three different drugs, geeked the fuck up, yeah we geeked the fuck up
How High, How High, How High, Molly, Gas, and Lean
How High, How High, How High, on Molly, Gas, and Lean

[Verse 1: PeeWee
Yeah on three different drugs, check my cup
Poured up on mud, big bank on me no dubs
Nothing but Blue Benjamin's, serving’ every drug a-z
Gas, marijuana, ivory, smoking’ we trip pin’ like How High
Hannah Montana, We dippin' on molly
Designer sprints what the fuck you expect
Pour that down my whole crew on a jet
Fly as a bitch can’t land where we at
South beach sand in my toes havin’ sex
High as a bitch on three different drugs
Stoned like rick James bitch I’m the plug
Slum-dog Millionaire switch a bitch up
Switch the pot serve half a brick up
A brick of Uncut dope have you high as all fuck
A deuce in my ruger and my double cup
My New York niggas from the bronx say big Ups
Pyrex Vision when I’m whippin’ it up
Yeah I’m keepin’ it crippin’ in dickies and chucks
Two fingers and the thumb chuckin’ it up
