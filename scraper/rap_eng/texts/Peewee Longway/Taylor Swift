[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
I got Longway in my kitchen cause I know that trap boomin'
I c-c-call him superchef because he know how to cook it
That codiene and that cookie got your bitch goin' stupid
We got that Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus makin' a movie
You know they say I'm broke now but I still buy what I want
These ain't no Robin jeans, baby girl, they Saint Laurent
It make me [?] when I walk, I'm goin J. Jill and [?]
And that's that South Park for you pussy niggas thinkin' I'm soft
I'm just- I'm just servin' pimpin' to these bitches, ugh
Pitchin knowledge to these niggas, ugh
[?] in the winter, burr
Give it to them then I hit it, boom
I'm the father figure in your picture, nigga
Fuck your mommas and fuck your sistas
Fuckin' asian and white girls and I don't give a fuck if they're fuckin sisters

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen]
Fuckin' with that superchef I turn yo girl to superfiend
She wanna ride around in retro vert Mercedes-Benz
I had to slow her down and turn her down on every scene
She be calling me and every night and ring-ring
Damn, and I be skating on her, too
Deux five for a young nigga, too
Pourin fours, pourin fours, in my Cadillac
I don't ride no Cadillac unless it's Uber Escalade
Cause I don't drive no more, I fly in a plane
Ain't got time no more, I do not talk to lames
Cookin' in the kitchen, with blueberry biscuits
Young nigga is on the roll I should've made the honor roll

[Verse 3: PeeWee Longway]
Got your bitch sneakin' and geekin' now your bitch can't shake the monkey
Turned your bitch into a junkie, on the Xanny bars unconscious
High-top stars on me, Givenchy
Backwood on backwood, I smoke out the munchies
That lil' bitch you fuckin', I served her an onion
Flipped it with Trinidad, ILoveMakonnen
Blue benjamins, she come running for money
I see that bitch feenin' through my new [?]
I think I'm dreamin she used to be hotter
Got your bitch still runnin' round in the lobby
I bet the [?] parking lots in the Rari, my trap going up Monday, Tuesday to Friday
Fuck up the lot in a brand new Bugatti, these bitches be thinking Longway 'Luminati
Trinidad gold all on my body, president rolley flooded up with molly
Got your bitch rollin' get geeked up in college
[?]
I clashed the four keep them bands in the closet
I cook a four 'fore you leave for the [?]
[?]
[?] she keep geekin' in private, Longway, bitch!
