[Intro]
Excuses, Excuses, Nigga got too many excuses
Excuses, Excuses, Nigga got too many excuses

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I’m your boyfriend favorite rapper nigga from Atlanta
Wanna take pictures with me like ‘Scuse me
I’mma catch that box, I’mma whip that brick
Nigga Can’t go broke, no excuses (Go to work then)
50 on my wrist caught your bitch suzy-choosy
Sent your bitch back home with excuses
I’mma get the money no excuses
I’mma wake up and trap no excuses
If yo bitch can’t catch the box then she useless
I’mma sip on Tussionex by the dueces
Wake up get back at it no excuses
I just want that money, no excuses
Pull up in a Rari red crucial
Tussionex young nigga leanin' off a deuce
Rattle looking like a donk trunk coming thru
Rose gold Forgiatos mounted deuce deuce
Blue Benjamins in my pocket they stuffed Bruce Bruce
Me and my niggas stay down to the bust down what it do
Trappin' and rappin' we gone make it happen no excuses
Norbs in the cabinet, Chopper came with machete
Young nigga get the package trap it at 7-11
Momma said I gotta be back in by before 11
No excuses, leanin’ man I’m feelin' like 50 and Lucci
45 Free Gucci
Half way home nigga half way out
Baby daddy singin’ all my songs in the house
Standin’ in the mirror like a bitch
Got yo hoe sayin' why yo on longway dick
Young nigga Longway Rich, Bitch
Young nigga Longway kick, get off his dick
Bitch mumbling on the breath got dick on the kiss
Longway fuck like he 6'6
Ferragamo buckle I ain't cuff no bitch
Drop the top I’m in a 6 4 hit switch
Rollie on my wrist Longway Bernie Mitch
I don’t give a fuck nigga Sixth Sense
Why a pussy nigga playin’ got six cents
I’mma let the 30 send him six feet
Ain’t no excuses free Big Meech
Longway and Chapo, PeeWee

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
50 bar on a nigga wrist game
Fifty pears you can it sent 80k
Ain’t no more excuses why you ain’t makin' your wrist cold
Sippin' and spillin’ that while I’m smokin on Nabisco
Too many excuses why you be screaming you ain't rich,hoe
Boy she got baby pussy but a fool suckin’ dick though
Got a little boyfriend pulling up pulling’ kick-doors
I got the FN I’mma blow off a big toe
I say what I wanna say I at any nigga like Pac
Niggas tryin play in the sins, so I send em on out
(Niggas sinnin' now he don't even play all that shit)
Fuck what they sayin'  imma pull up on the scene hangin’ like a bandit
I got like a band my palms on red
Pussy nigga got a fake card like Frendie
Hit his ass right there where he standing
Longway yeah he high demanding
Standing in the kitchen trappin' that pack up out the cabinet
Zippers on zippers and them Xannies
Jackie Tan a make than bitch jump up right out her panties
You a think she managed
Got too many chances to throw the ball like madden
You would think Longway from Cali
(Longway Bitch)
