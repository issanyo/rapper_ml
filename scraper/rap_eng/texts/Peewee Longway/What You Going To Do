What you gone do when you first get that bond
What you gone do when you first buy that gun
What you gone do when you ain’t got no bond
What you gone do when they come with a charge
Tell on yourself or tell em IDK?
Hit em with the 40 and the AK
Fuck that shit snitches get shot in the face
Yo bitch on my line I’mma fuck her today
Fuck that bitch I’mma nut all in her face
Fuck that bitch I’mma trap out where she stay
Fuck that bitch she put her name on that case
Yo bitch was a loner she’d go back today
I get the strongest weed up out the bay (Gas)
You wonder why yo bitch keep calling me bae (Ay Bae Bae)
I keep them bundles on me everyday
Fuck that shit Snitches get shot in face

[Verse 1: PeeWee LongWay]
No pussy shit we send that shit out for bait
A room full of killers, I can relate
Wrap em up and eat the duck off the plate
Take the while after while they say
Longway might turn to Top-Shottas, K,K
Got your bitch to sign up for a dirty AK
What you gone do when they come with a case
You gone tell on yourself or tell em’ IDK?
Fuck that shit snitches get shot in the face
Hit em with the 40 and the AK
Some shit you seen that you know you shouldn’t say
Vacuum Seal the gas come out the bay
Gotta let em know look it in the face
Drank a lil' geeked off a dope dick
Yellow banana perc tears got her itchin
Sippin on tussionex watchin’ 70 inches
I make a movie netflix on bitches
Sit top ten on 60 I’m crippin'
What would you do on that dirty k mission
Rich rollin’ in the Double R, Fuck it lets get it
Smoke out the 478 in my city, Sammy Coca
I got Patties so sweet, that Fabulous hit

Meet my Migo by the dock with that check

Dirty face young nigga walk up and hit it

We work out yo bitch house and trap out the trenches
Servin’ the junkies that jump over fences

Cook up that coke like Chipotle Dinner
Breakin’ my wrist with the rollie spinning’
