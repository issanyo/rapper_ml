[Chorus: Slime God Mondo]
I could sign for a deal right now
I'll never trade all my niggas
I could hit four mill right now, nigga
I'll never trade all my niggas
Might change my style, my change my swag
But I'll never change on my niggas
Nigga, loyalty before royalty
I'll never trade all my niggas
I'll never trade all my niggas, I'll never trade all my niggas
I'll never trade all my niggas, I'll never trade all my niggas
I could sign for a deal right now, nigga
I'll never trade all my niggas
I could hit four mill right now, nigga
I'll never trade all my niggas

[Verse 1: Slime God Mondo]
I know some niggas that done traded
I know some niggas that done faded
I know some niggas that done hated on me today
Really want take in my places
We [?] our respect from the bottom
Now, who do these niggas think we weren't gon' make it?
My neck and the wrist is amazing
Fool, you can't touch it, that's [?]

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
What the fuck I look like, switching up, nigga?
It ain't in my blood to be a fuck nigga
Fucking with Crips and Bloods, nigga
The killers and the drug dealers
How the fuck you gon' sign the plug, nigga
Before I go out like a dud?
I'ma get money out the mud, nigga
'Cause we [?] might cut out your tongue, nigga

[Verse 3: Jose Guapo]
We come in with no invitation
And stay late
And those pussy niggas can't take it
Look at their faces
The way that we're living, they say it's relentless
And even if the people give gave the millions
Won't trade in my niggas, tay down with my niggas
Stay down in Givenchys

[Chorus: Slime God Mondo]
I could sign for a deal right now
I'll never trade all my niggas
I could hit four mill right now, nigga
I'll never trade all my niggas
Might change my style, my change my swag
But I'll never change on my niggas
Nigga, loyalty before royalty
I'll never trade all my niggas
I'll never trade all my niggas, I'll never trade all my niggas
I'll never trade all my niggas, I'll never trade all my niggas
I could sign for a deal right now, nigga
I'll never trade all my niggas
I could hit four mill right now, nigga
I'll never trade all my niggas

[Verse 4: PeeWee Longway]
Due to the fact I don't trade on my niggas with the same old niggas and the bricks
[?] the nigga a brick, me and my nigga don't slip
Fuck around and get your ass found in a ditch
[?] green lights, I'm gone, little nigga
Ride on my nigga for a hoe, you tripping
You better flip the bitch and fuck up the kitchen
Breaking my wrist, whipping feathers off pigeons
Stars on my jumper, she kick it
I dream of Jeannie, little bitch
Lamborghini monument
Trade all my niggas for a million?
Pussy nigga, should have been a [?]
Mumu shades on, bitch, you feel me?
No flex zone
She knows better
I need the best dome
'Cause the best strong
Valet the horse, no Django
Diamonds on my neck like shackles
Still serving chickens, Bojangles
Mondo on the hook, it's a banger
Just me and my niggas, no strangers

[Chorus: Slime God Mondo]
I could sign for a deal right now
I'll never trade all my niggas
I could hit four mill right now, nigga
I'll never trade all my niggas
Might change my style, my change my swag
But I'll never change on my niggas
Nigga, loyalty before royalty
I'll never trade all my niggas
I'll never trade all my niggas, I'll never trade all my niggas
I'll never trade all my niggas, I'll never trade all my niggas
I could sign for a deal right now, nigga
I'll never trade all my niggas
I could hit four mill right now, nigga
I'll never trade all my niggas
I could sign for a deal right now
I'll never trade all my niggas
I could hit four mill right now, nigga
I'll never trade all my niggas
Might change my style, my change my swag
But I'll never change on my niggas
Nigga, loyalty before royalty
I'll never trade all my niggas
I'll never trade all my niggas, I'll never trade all my niggas
I'll never trade all my niggas, I'll never trade all my niggas
I could sign for a deal right now, nigga
I'll never trade all my niggas
I could hit four mill right now, nigga
I'll never trade all my niggas
