[Hook: PeeWee & Young Thug]
50 some bands on my juice
Spikes on top of Jimmy Choos
So fresh that I made the news
Made a million in the trap, dealin' fool
20 bands in my locker at school
Me and Longway too cool for you fools
MPA, YSL what it do?
We don't play fair or play by your rules
I think I'm 2Pac, got the juice
With a bad bitch smokin' on fruit
I think I'm 2Pac, got the juice
In the foreign whip, pullin up, juice
I think I'm 2Pac, got the juice
We the shit, Thug Life my clique
I think I'm 2Pac, got the juice
I think I'm 2Pac, got the juice


[Verse 1: PeeWee & Young Thug]
I got the boots, I got a coupe
I got no roof
I got a boo, she got a boo with way bigger boobs
Longway and Thugger
We switcharoo bitches and we like to fuck em' by the two
Jumanji, Jumanji, Giuseppe Zanotti
The leprechaun bitches move
I walk in the club and I dap it
My coupe is all filled with gadgets
Get way too much green like a salad
Wrap it and ship it the package
Young nigga's trappin' and rappin'
I got the pints stacked up in my cabinet
Young rich nigga live lavish
I [?] for the kids
I'm spending a hundred bands, just to fuck up my kidneys
Sneaking, geeking on the molly, know she feelin'
I got the juice, pull up Actavis too with your bitch
Rollin' up the good fruit
Sippin' and spillin', pour 8 in the deuce
Lean, lean, lean
I'm Uncle Phil for the week
I got Pints only for me
Smokin' on g
Tell uncle Snoop what It do, it is too plain to see
Long way lil bitch check my Feng Shui
I got the juice in the booth, we can turn the fuck up any day

[Verse 2]
How the fuck I can't afford
My molly white like a tourist
Her booty fatter than Norbit
I told your bitch that she was gorgeous
Just a little something to do when I get bored
Might pull up, get head in the Porsche
Light the fuck up leave the bitches, no torch
Hundred bricks stuffed in the Honda Accord
Hundred grand inside my pockets, San-Tan molly
Imma make your bitch snort it
Peewee Longway, the Blue M&M
Made a million dollar dealin', food
My style is safari, she [?] my body
And put spikes on top of my Jimmy Choo's
Got spikes on my Louie Vuitton's
My diamonds they hit it and fight like a hadouken
That pussy so wet, I think she got shot in the coochie with the uzi
Young Thugga and Longway I don't fuck with dude's, playin' with choppers making breaking news
No doctor prescription but we got the juice
Colossal livin', Double R Peekaboo
