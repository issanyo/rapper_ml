Tick tock it don’t stop (x3)
She in the cut tryna size a nigga up nahm sayin’
See me rollin’ up, now she wanna come fire up nahm sayin’

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
San Fransisco Cookies Cherry Pie in my backwood
Mr Blue Benjamins see me knotted up
50 ball on my wrist in
Money ain’t stopping just wanna see how far it go
Longway keep it crippin’ you can ask my Locs
Longway Christopher Columbus put it on a boat
OG Marijuana I get it in by the boat
Chinchilla I put it on my hoe
Hop out that Audi MPA on a dookie roll
Brand new Givenchy's on my feet its not a joke
Eat it up lil bitch get the dick up out your throat
Yo bitch in the trenches says I can trap, yeah thats a go

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Dabbin’ on em in Phillepe
Baby say my style it gotta be from overseas
She see the Blue Benjamins in my Diesel Jeans
She ask me what type of weed
Sherbert, OG and the Cherry Pie, aye
Jackie Tan in my fifth pocket you can get high (booted up, aye)
Black and white like the concord we leavin in’ drab
I fuck her good she catch the ube thats the cab
Another bitch on the way tryna give me some ass
She ask me why I’m movie’ so fast
I take penitentary chances out here movin’ these bags-
She saw my pimpin’ up told me to buy her a bag

Tick tock it don’t stop (x3)
She in the cut tryna size a nigga up nahm sayin’
See me rollin’ up now she wanna come fire up nahm sayin’
