[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
All my niggas on drugs
All my niggas on drugs
All my niggas got drugs
Party pack turn up with your goods
Drugs drugs drugs
All my niggas on drugs
All my niggas got drugs
Party pack turn up with your goods
Drugs drugs drugs (All my niggas geeked up)
Drugs drugs
All my niggas got drugs
Drugs drugs drugs (All my niggas geeked up)
All my niggas on drugs

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Narcotics narcotics
How bout it we got it
Cook dope wanna ASAP Rocky
Wrist game make it do the Ricky Bobby
Got molly wanna run around the lobby?
Me and my niggas booted up we in the lobby
We don’t roll doobies up or smoke Bobby
Pull up in the Bentley truck or the Rari
Heard you wanna meet the plug I’m the socket
A nigga too geeked up in Neiman Marcus
I’m on drugs, bitch I beg you’re pardon
I’m on the lean and the white Remy Martin
Me and all my niggas on drugs
Me and all my niggas we the plug
Me and all my niggas give a fuck
Me and all my niggas turnt up
Turn down for what?
Ranned out of pints ‘fore I ranned out of supply
Talking through the wire, boy your ass gon die
Drugs made it happen, boy you think I’m a lie?
Made a mil Saran wrapping, mail man make it fly
I get higher when they tell me that the package arrived
I got drugs in bitch I’m working
You can tell that I’m high from the look on my eyes I’m geeked up
Bitch me and my niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 2: MPA Shitro]
I wake and bake to start my day then pull up on my plug
All my niggas trafficking we known for selling drugs
Got 50 gas bags in the tub got another 100 bags on tuck
Got your bitch popping molly booted up
Got boys for the fiend shoot up
Drop the work in the pot then you hit it with the fork
Tryna make your drugs double up
I’ma jugg 100 bricks go buy a double R
Dope boy rich rolling off drugs
I’m a walking PET poured up on mud
Sparkles on the pints of lean all all in the glove
Party pack dipping out the party sack
Rolling up with the homies all on drugs
Drugs drugs we all on drugs
Who want jugg? We all gon jugg
The whole damn hood ?
Still smoking cali bud out the Backwoods
All my niggas on jugg in the back hood
? nigga we don’t bang that hood
Say you getting money nigga put that on my hood
Drugs drugs
