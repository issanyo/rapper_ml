Aye!
[Chorus]:
I'm from the project, yeah we trap and make a million
I'm from the project, it ain't nothin but drug dealing
I'm from the project, every night gon be some killing
I'm from the project, Fuck a bitch behind the building

[Hook]:
I fuck with them gudda guys they come from the other side

[Verse 1]:
I'm from the project where they really be killing
Pulling that bitch, that ain't nothin' but sadity
Young nigga trap and rubberband bundles
Hundred round drum on my gun that's Osama
You hear that bitch, Ka Ka Ka by your window
In The Summertime you hug up under your momma
I hit the projects and run up a check
Audemars wrist, thats a stupid Breguet
I got a bitch on a bitch having sex
Aye, I am a Cali connect
Uhh I make your bitch get wet
Aye, turn up that bitch for a check

[Chorus]:

[Verse 2]:
Jump out serve the bricks in them trenches
Juggin pounds of bricks, fuck a credential
One way in this bitch, how you gon' enter
Try that sneaky shit yeah we gon' kill em
The bricks like the zoo full of gorillas
Dope dealers and trap-ing that thriller
Gambino Brick stomps in the middle
Couple of bitches gon' trap for that nigga
No strap no trap she put Mac's on the nigga
Yeah that other side, murder capital nigga
We front you a pack if you packing lil nigga
Got bodies and Benjamin's, stack it up
UPS, FEDEX truck back em up
You can come to the hood and get a sack of dust
That got neighborhood watch, watching out for us
Trap the Habitat Housing, we tear 'em up
(Longway Bitch!)

[Chorus]:
