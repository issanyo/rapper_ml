[Hook]
Master Peewee got the hook up
Might show how to cook up
Slanging off the cell phone call before you pull up
It's the ice cream man
It's the ice cream man
It's the ice cream man
It's the ice cream man
Master Peewee got the hook up
Might show how to cook up
Slanging off the cell phone call before you pull up
It's the ice cream man
It's the ice cream man
It's the ice cream man
It's the ice cream man

[Verse 1 ]
I see murders everyday in my hood
I got fiends on the corner
Bust a brick down it smell like ammonia
Mister Serve-On standing on the corner
I can hook you up if you want it
Ice Cream Man I'll whip up Napoleon
Smoking on the three gram blunts of the sherb
Tiffany Fendi's on my face look like a nerd
A thousand and 8 on both my ears 2 birds
Hop out with that Silk da Shocker at your shirt
Ima let her do the dirt (do the dirt)
Black and blue coming over with the work
Frank Meuller got the bird flu alert
G-wagon Benz came mounted up wit the skirt
Bricks in the hood I'ma show you how to do it
Cooking up, young niggas I was bombs bombs bombs
M.P.A tanks, extendos, all they drums
Tatted my body up like a subway in Harlem
Master P we cut the front yard with the carbine
I'll show you how to hit it with the left arm
Drop a deuce bring the gram back stepped on
Gotta be hit me up on the Nextel phone
My man still got cases deals
Trap house still got work for real
You can pull up to the hill and get a personal deal

[Verse 2]
Whip up that yellow, Yo Gotti, that white peter pan
Jugg the bricks off a flip phone Virgin Mobile
Zone 1, Zone 6 Mr. Ice Cream Mobile
Youngin thuggin in the trenches like Hot Boy Turk
Bandana like Soulja Slim rocking Girbaud's again
Master P we hooking up these hoes again
I'm in the Bo whippin up an O running Ricky Bo got a nigga
Traphouse in a figure fo'
(?) crack like this
Molly brick coming back Ric Flair
Master Peewee sending gas bags through comcast
Ima hook it up break it down weigh it up
Back that mail truck up, I'm a bail seller
Pull that bread truck up, I'm a jail, break the plug I'm a daredevil
Master Peewee came here hooking up the ending
Any three catch me in the trap with the semi
Young nigga with pistol bust yo ass in the front yard
My mama coming out the door take the charge
Master Peewee hook it up, the lawyer beat the charge
Right between the water with the funnel cake
I'ma shoot the [?] with the Anna Mae
Longway
