[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted in my life was a new bankroll
Came up in the street the jet that pack like dominos
Ear neck wrist froze, candy paint be Picasso
Cherry pie mixed with Gelato
I just bought a crib where the trap house go
New jewelry, new bitches, new watches, new house
New everything
Blue Benjis six digits, ten times I put that on everything
On the stove I cook up the caine, I seen the mary jane
Call me Pablo at the corner store I buy up the rubber bands
Ten thousand in the bomb spray your door like the Orkin man
Bundles on top of bundles in the hood I’m the fortune man
Forgis on them fours pulling up like a marching band
Hundred round draco 223’s on the diamond back

[Hook]
Lean sipping boss gone got another case closed
Wake up in the morning trying to get a damn bankroll
I supply the trenches, I pay bills for them lil hoes
Bank roll, Bank roll, Bank roll
Wake up in the morning time to get a damn bankroll
Bank roll, Bank roll, Bank roll
Wake up in the morning time to get a damn bankroll

[Verse 2]
Snatch a nine up out every brick
Sack a deuce up nothing but veneers
Stacking up blue Benjis Jeffersons Jacksons
The grants in the vent
Roll with Dracos and mac90s FN’s and them mac 10s
Pocket rocket tucked in my back end
Smoking on a big blunt basket
Coupe skrt skrt money bankroll
Back in a bitch with the bowl
Rose gold Patek Philippe
I like my money neat, sell a whole hundred a week
Cuban link come out that Mr. T
Beat on my chest like I'm willie B
Put the OG in the street for thirty three
I got god fear of stripe referee
Pull up tesla up in Trestle Tree
Bank roll, Bankroll Fresh
RIP, still sipping lean like Pimp C
Now these hoes come and pimp wee
VV Diamonds stash it in the tempurpedic
Posted where the real crips be
When I hit the door I blast his ass
Kill take the hollow make the clips sneeze
Bitch

[Hook]
Lean sipping boss gone got another case closed
Wake up in the morning trying to get a damn bankroll
I supply the trenches, I pay bills for them lil hoes
Bank roll, Bank roll, Bank roll
Wake up in the morning time to get a damn bankroll
Bank roll, Bank roll, Bank roll
Wake up in the morning time to get a damn bankroll
Get it
