(Intro)
That ain't new to me. (I hate to break it to you)
That ain't new to me(Gangster!)
(Gangster grillz still being what it is in the street)
That ain't new to me
That ain't new to me
Longway, Longway, Bitch!


(Hook: PeeWee Longway)
You talk about getting into money
I say .. That ain't new to me
You talk about busting them guns
I say .. That ain't new to me
You talk about bitches on bitches
I say... That ain't new to me
You talk about standing in trenches
I tell you..That ain't new to me...
(Bridge)(2x)
Tell me some shit I don't know
Tell me some shit I don't know
Tell me some shit I don't know...
That ain't new to me

(Verse 1: PeeWee Longway)
Tell me some shit I don't know shooting a 40 at you in the air
In the trenches with lions and bears
A pussy nigga can't rap
Fucking bitches with no hair
Menage on Menage, two bitches
Got too many followers, I stay trending topic
Kick it major flavors balenciaga popping
Most of you niggas be popping Callaso
I really  make the mailman drop off them boxes
Tell me some shit I don't know about
Who breaking they wrist in the Pyrex pot
That lil shit right there ain't new to me
I been making that dope do 23. Jump!
Kirk Gambine(?) whip up the cookies serve traps out the trunk
Longway new release got the city bumpin'
Trunk out the any and walk into the function.(?)
Bitches on bitches And hoes on hoes
That lil bit shit don't mean nothin' to me

(Verse 2: PeeWee Longway)
Tell me some shit that you think I don't know
Like a ufo a bitch ain't goin'go
Don't come at me, t'alm bout no dope on a boat
Come at me t'alm  me this some cheap ass gold
I'm the type to put all my whips on some fours
Bands in my safe it like four or five codes
OG Gas bag it from different zip code
Since a juvenile I stuck to the g codes
I stayed in the trenches, got bitches on bitches..
I played with the fish, call me finding nemo
That 30 extendo, he think he D-bo
Tell me some shit that you think I don't know
Tell me some shit that is new to me
I can't wait to get a fucking funeral started
Get that dope out the water, turn my trap to Carter
Longway Nino been had this shit in order
Don't tell me you the plug unless you cross the borders
Play round with my money, I kidnap your daughter
That ain't new to me..
Louboutin, balenciaga, chanel on my feet
Sipping High Tech and Test the only time I sleep
In God I trust the only thing in my dreams
Wake up chasing money like I'm meek
Tell me some shit, that ain't new to me
