[Hook: Hoodrich Pablo Juan & Woop]
Watch me cook it like I work for Beni's
I make the dope Digiorno and deliver it
Seventy-seven chickens, I’ma sell fifty
Hanging in the neighborhood, rolling sixty
Paid thirty for two different chickens
Seasons switching and I’m dropping my tickets
Whole ton of midget stuck to my Bentley
Pablo done fucked up the kitchen
Shooter's got a cuckoo K, karate chop the yay, sensei
Heard I go cuckoo crazy, I cook buku-yay
Hang with a package your way, fully auto choppers my way
Plug go cuckoo crazy, my shooters go cuckoo crazy

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Trapping on the block with 80’s baby
Harvest season drop the ticket crazy
Gas bags smell like onions
Shoot a fuck nigga in they bunion
Pull up with two, Woop go cuckoo crazy
Choppers and handguns with layers
Pablo deliver the CC
I ain’t trying fuck a bitch for a BB
Chris Brown, beat her down, RiRi
Swan Givenchy, 'ndangered species
Presidential Rollie full of VV’s
Thot’s and Kardashian’s, I’d rather fuck Keke
Gilligan’s Island skippers on my feet
Money keep piling, Blue Benjamin me
My plug be sending the pack, me in Greece
They say I’m a star, I just Givenchy’d me
Got a cuckoo bitch, say that she Portuguese
Trap with the ducks and the geese
The difference from a duck, I’m PeeWee
Trap house beating off a leash
Cash out, I got Keisha
Pimping 33
Right after Pippen shoot three
Fuck nigga, find us a fee

[Verse 2: Woop]
First time James Brown geeked
Pulled up, one chop deep
Outside, front yard beef
On the molly, turn that pussy pink
Cuban link chain for the double rolls
I fucked them over for my folks
Plug talking on the Virgin Mobile
They screaming that uncle Eddie, though
That fish, dirty fish without a mess
Trap went until we got the A1 guts
Handicap Woop, ain’t I stuttering
Dirty bitch, I let all my brother’s hit
Heard you went and fucked with your enemy
That shit, it ain’t none of my business
I sip on two cups, boy, I pop up on stuffington
Pour a whole four of that muddington
I just be jacking and jugging lately
I’ve been dodging for Walter Payton
I’m anticipating, steady waiting
Listen to the top-lock, lock
Signed an autograph the other day
I'm still dodging crack rock, cops
Watch me hit it like a fucking winner
A1 crack rock, denim
I must work at Denny's

[Verse 3: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Had a client meeting, eating Beni's
How many you getting determines the ticket
Hurry up, negotiate the business
Gotta go meet the plug's mistress at the boat, time to go fishing
A minute late, there's a brick missing
76, I done sold fifty
Been looking like young nigga for silver-riding on 26’s
I ain’t mean to mention all the remixing
Took a six out of your 36-ing
Bought a five and made a whole chicken
I think I spent a Bentley in Givenchy
Cold Turkey, sold the cuddy for thirty
Now he on my Motorola, chirping
Talking 'bout the falcon too dirty
Gotta put them back in the water, little buddy
I know it ain’t come back to nothing
You 'bout that blow, Curtis
Selling the dummy to dummies, guess it was worth it
Bought the Maybach with the curtains
Pull up, giving all the work to the workers
Catch the skirt, hide from Secret Service
Cripple bezel yellow, too conservative
And the rock, I'm cooking through with a purpose, nigga
