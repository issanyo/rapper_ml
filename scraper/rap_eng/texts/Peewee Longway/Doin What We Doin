Turnt the fuck up on they ass thats what we doin'
Rubber band inside them bags thats what we doin'
Knock yo' bitch don't call, just smash, thats what we doin'
Park them four doors on the grass thats what we doin'

Fuck a nigga mean what we doin'
I’m just doing what we doing, what we doing what we doing
Knock a nigga bitch what I'm doin'
Switcharoo the nigga clique she hoein'
Take a look at the dick [?]
Playin' in the spur winter time with a clip
Just doing what I’m doing in the Enzo 'Rari
Fuckin' foreign bitches in the whip

Longway got it on his hip
I'm the west coast neighborhood 60's crip
Me and [?] rockin'
Exclusive J's comin' in from RIF
We just doing what we doin still rip the rip
Maison bags on her ass still take trips, trips
VVS diamonds drip drip drip

Ricky bobby in the pyrex whip whip
Cooking dope in some fresh Patrick Ewings
Woah, molly got me chewing, piped up
Longway got your bitch chewing
Woah, I'm doing what I'm doing
D boy racks on me I juug
