(Hook) x2
(?) is not my bar
James Bond got me switching up the car
(?) audemars
And my motor blew I need some more oil

(Verse 1)
Longway James Bond
Full fergus on
Bad bitch with buns
Get my fucking gangster on
Hold on get my OG on
Pour up mud in my Styrofoam
Pike up and bricks counts up for em
Jugging making plays at home
In the foreign, I just fully gadget
Pressing buttons that's that ratchet
Longway plowing(?) I'm loaded fucker
Tote that gun 'fore shit get bouncing(?)
OG Gas I'm bricking faster
Thousand dollars on Giuseppe stampers
Who wanna fuck on Longway Hefner
Trying to find and help ya
My jewels on another level
So much cash gonna need a shovel
Play bout that 6 feet they bury ya
(?) sides and 6 paul-bearers
I ain't talking loud nigga
I ain't trying to scare you
I'm Longway Bond I come to your area
Each of our boys Forgiatos on the front
With my arm hanging out showin nothin for the (?)

(Hook) x2
(?) is not my bar

(Verse 2)
Y'all eat your eyeballs what the fuck you think came from
Drank in my cup Kirko Bangz where he come from
She gotta be a chill lady with a damn pompom
A long way blow with a palm in a pompom
Looking all sand south beach on the country
Pyrex pot with my palm on my wrist beat
Whipping up Eddie Kane here to make your heartbeat
Smoking on Mary Jane cloud 9 I be
Running round the lobby popping them mollies
Switching up foreigners can't catch Longway
Bond on the streets, can't catch Longway
Burn gut of heat safari on my feet
Cheetah! Ooh! Foolin me
Y.S.L. lipstick girl come kiss me
Bustin out the spandex, girl you too thick
I don't like automatic I'll take the stick shift
My motor blowed I'm pour the 4 on the circuit
Bands on the road you'll get em when the sun lift
Pull up at your door I ain't trying to hit a doorstep
PeeWee James Bond and I'm fly than the sun beam
I open up fire I stay on the door step
Pro with the tool .45 ten in the clip
Longway James I smash anything
(?)boy VVS's on my pinky ring

(Hook)
