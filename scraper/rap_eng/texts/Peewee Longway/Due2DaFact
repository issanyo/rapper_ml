Due to the fact the chopper came with coolers
Due to the fact the pack coming in back to back
Due to the fact where you trapping at
Taking the pots, I am dunking the bowl
I turn the kitchen to a Shaq attack
I mastered the pot but the bowl is a mission
I turn the kitchen to a finger fuck
Due to the fact that I’m lyrical
In love with the bowl but no cereal
Remember watching movie ATL
My guap in the back of the stereo
