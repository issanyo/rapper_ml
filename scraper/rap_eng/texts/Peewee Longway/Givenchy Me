Fifty bricks, sipping Pedro from Mexico plus I got a hundred gas bags on the runway
I'ma front half to Longway 'cause he got a blue trap house and get it all gone in one day
I got young niggas ready for the gunplay while I'm on the stove, busting bricks like a sensei
Just bust a Cartier from DeVante, got all these hoes trying to check out my feng shui
Bad bitches, they digging me, walk in the club, I Givenchy me
Bad bitches, they digging me, walk in the club, I Givenchy me
Bad bitches, they digging me, walk in the club, I Givenchy me
Bad bitches, they digging me, walk in the club, I Givenchy me

[Verse 1: Offset]
My pockets is fat, it's on pregnant
Your pockets is on anorexic
Dropping my top, I dissect it
Sipping lean, pinky up, that is good etiquette
Run to the money, I go and get it
Bad bitches cooking up the Britney
All these niggas out here selling midget
They really ain't getting no fucking benjis
Pull up, hop out
Diamonds shining, take they heart out
Niggas acting like they smarter
Dunk a brick like I'm Vince Carter
You telling a story like authors
Old nigga fucking your daughter
I walk in the club with Givenchy
Money taller than a ruler, twelve inches
I had to sit down for a sentence
Drill a nigga like a dentist
Whip a brick like a chemist
Jesus faces, I'm a Christian
Niggas need to fucking listen
Nigga, you ain't getting Benjis
Young nigga, my wrist
Shit on niggas, diamonds pissing

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Stars all around a nigga ankle
It's Givenchy, bad bitches eating up the swag
Kicking with the plug sensei
My trap house booming, young rich nigga eating with the bag
Lamborghini, Gallardo, Bugatti, paper tag
Riding around, checking out the matte black Jag
Did I do that? Splash on they ass
Givenchy, Givenchy, GIvenchy swag
I might just nerd her like Dexter
Fucking and clinching the Heckler Koch
Please do not touch on my knots
Those are Givenchy, them bitches are hot
Now and Later flavor, bitch a alligator
Serving up brick on a yacht
Price of Givenchy's a lot
Bad bitches eat it up a lot
Peter Pan jumping out the pot
Givenchy swagging somewhere in Dubai
Leopards and alligators in my car
Lavish nigga pulling up, double R
Passenger yes, sir, no, sir
Swagger too dope, make you overdose
OG gas you don't wanna smoke
Two truckloads back to back, we juug
