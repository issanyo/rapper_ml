[Hook:]
Everything presidential
From my money
Forty pointers in the rollie, I forgot to mention
Look at the pointers
Presidential sweet foreign fruits in it
Ye they foreign nigga
Coupe parked outside presidential shit
Er'thing presidential
From my money, er'thing
Er'thing presidential
To my rollie, er'thing
Er'thing presidential
I be getting money, er'thing
I'm the number 1 counterfeit
I'll be stuntin'

[Verse 1:]
Er'thing presidential
My digits on long distance
20 karats in my ear, I can't listen
They fold it and they packet it I forgot to mention
Round that up, round that up I want that bentley
Your trap bang bing if I ain't sizzle
That's what I do everything presidential
Cars, bitches I'm in through the benches
There's a spaceship right there
You can't see what's in it
This a nigga bitch face in my lap texting nutrition
Deep throat that hoe, scheming her dinner
Shout out my hussler, everything presidential

[Hook:]
Everything presidential

Forty pointers in the rollie, I forgot to mention

Presidential sweet foreign fruits in it
Ye they foreign nigga
Coupe parked outside presidential shit
Er'thing presidential
From my money, er'thing
Er'thing presidential
To my rollie, er'thing
Er'thing presidential
I be getting money, er'thing
I'm the number 1 counterfeit

[Verse 2:]
Presidential lifestyle
Your whole clique stopped
Me and PeeWee banging 2 hoes at the wrist cards
You the type, don't know how the crate look
Clear shape like an apple
This ain't no mad bull
Either you 90 stay dope boys of America
Give me a scale, measure his digit up
All white men saying call a miracle
Get 'em dance off that you think it's a miracle
We ain't never sleep call them patient order
Throw that money up think they hold on my order
I'll never fall put that on my mother
You ain't a boss until you get them things a credit order

[Hook:]
Everything presidential

[Verse 3: PeeWee Longway]
Presidential flight all night to Pluto
Sign light speaking with the fork friko
Presidential sweet on with the county G hoe
Pipe the fly each the crescent we behind my work
Feature on the creature please the peeper custom features
The parlay ain't new to this
Presidential rollie, did it
Holy off the Glock dimension
Lulu bricks they got me winning
Bench crush 4 in it, presidential cookies got me winnin
Turned up my campaign, now im in my own lane
Blowing cookie had the brain, dope spokesman of the game
MPA don't take it tame
Get it on on the plane
Presidential er'thing, presidential er'thing

[Hook:]
Everything presidential
From my money
For the pounds in the rollin off the gap mansion
Look at the point of me
Presidential sweet foreign fruit toll me
Ye they foreign nigga
Coupe parked outside presidential shit
Er'thing presidential
From my money, er'thing
Er'thing presidential
To my rollie, er'thing
Er'thing presidential
I be getting money, er'thing
I'm the number 1 counterfeit
I'll be stuntin'
