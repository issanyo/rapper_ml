[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I remember when I was a freshman
You would think a stylist dressed me
No you can't tell me none bout how to dress bitch
I'm the freshest nigga ever to get fresh bitch
Bricks on ice cause I need some refreshments
My nigga don't pour nothing less than four
We get money I didn't mean to stress it
Done come round me less you know how the dress bitch

[Verse 1]
My bitch is so fly man she so jazzy
Every time you see her she be smashin'
She classier than a bitch but she get nasty
If I wasn't gettin' money I know she'd trash me, damn
I give it to her she don't gotta ask me
I'm sippin' lean my voice is kinda raspy, uh-uh
Attractive and I met her at the classic
Was passin' kush but then I let her pass me
You married hoe don't mind me askin'
I told her I hate haters with a passion
Hang wit me, I could put you up on fashion
You finally here but you dressed so fashion
You coordinated you need to mix match it
I got that [?] pack I do gymnastics
She told me fuck that shit cause
And I can suck that dick, Gucci you know you like that

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Fly kid, bitches love to see me in fly kicks
Rockin' Tom Ford, hoes stand in line for my concord
The teacher love to see me comin' right on the chalk board
Draped up from head to toe, designer and diamonds
Hoes got a crush on a player, ear to ear smilin'
Dope boy freshman in a CC letterman
Ferragamo buckle, Versace Medusa sesame
Louis Vuitton Duffle, 100k nothin' but Benji's in it
I'mma fuckin' freshman in the same car the principle in
OG bags bunkin' I'mma go and throw the forgis on it
Bunkin' out the locker all the hoes say they goin' for me
Number 9, say they love that aroma on me
