[Verse 1]
Whole lotta lean in my motherfucking piss
Whole lotta gas in my motherfucking piss
Then a couple gas packs in my motherfuckin' kit
Woke up in a new Bugatti, hungover from molly
Blue Benjamin's all in my pocket, runnin' around the fuckin' lobby
She wanna Nicki Minaj
She wannna fuck on my squad
Lil bitch, go ahead, go hard
Put it on hood, then everybody gnarly
Fuckin' on Holly like Bob Barker
Ya'll nigga fake, got a counterfeit marker
Habitat housing turn him into a trick
BD break him down on benches
BD beat him in the face if he snitch
Steaming body up like [?]
Look how that chopper just flip
Universal clip, presidential whip, we with the shit
Pop or die, motherfucker
Go 8 mile with that cut
Leave his ass with
Pussy boy thought I was butter
Bumboclaat, Jamaican butters
Come through like they undercovers
Fuckin' your bitch undercovers
Looking for your bitch, you must love her
Ain't too many bitches I ain't fuck
Punching the pussy, uppercut, beat it up
I done come a long way, double up

[Hook]
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Trappin' gas pack comin' in from the Bay
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Trappin' with my everyday with them AK
Switcharoo everyday
Switcharoo, ayy
Switcharoo
Switcharoo everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Get a new bitch and switcharoo

[Verse 2]
All blue my whole squad
Nolo's on the bed, trappin' extortion
Four car garage, [?] highway Porsche
Hocus pocus, top aborted
Crack it up, pushing one button
Fuck it on four pockets I need abortion
I kinda feel like I'm Norbit
The special Blue Benjamin, poof
Trappin' with my everyday
A house full of AK
OG gas from the Bay, I've been gettin' for decades
Everyday I made them birdies fly, hablo my essay
I ran that sack up crazy Everyday, everyday
In the kitchen, bring them babies
Everyday, bring your lady
Still fuckin' bitches in my J's
Longway blonde still stuck in they ways
Switcharoo your main bitch
Tropical Givenchy's, too much flava
Bitch you can eat it up now or later
Gingerbread man, on the everyday [?]
