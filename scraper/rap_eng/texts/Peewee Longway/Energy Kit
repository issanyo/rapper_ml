I ran them blocks all night
I had to get out there and get me some money (Moneefa)
Ain’t Never had shit, I ran them blocks all night
I had to get out there and get me some money
She ain’t Never talking shit but you can see it thru her smile
Money comin’ in a little funny
My momma was my mom and daddy and I’m the sidekick
Energy kit, Energy kit, my momma thats my energy kit
Energy kit, Energy kit

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
I get it from my momma thumbing thru them hundreds
Fuck ya feed ya fiends talking to ya honor
What ain’t gone kill ya lil nigga gone make ya stronger
Ain't heard that from no nigga heard that from my momma
Birdies in the winter lets Turn up in the summer
Lick my first blunt up and smoke it with my momma
Hey what the move is she peeping’ ?

Blow his shit back, don’t let em' take your energy
Haters coming mismatched, I know what the move is

Thats why I run the extra mile tryna stack it up
And i don’t mind putting miles on the stealing truck
Flex up on these fuck niggas, ain’t never had shit
My momma was my daddy, and I’m the side-kick
