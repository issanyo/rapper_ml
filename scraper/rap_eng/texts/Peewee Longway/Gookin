[Chorus]
I'm too legit, stick came with the coolin' system
Fuck the justice system, man, my lawyer too official
This the trapper district, all we do is traffic chickens (Trap, trap)
I'm a mathematician, M&Ms in my tunnel vision (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm super lit (Yeah)
Yeah, we gookin' with it (I'm gookin' with it)
Get that dirty stick and shoot your favorite shooter with it
Yeah, I'm super lit (I'm super lit)
Yeah, we gookin' with it (Gookin' with it)
Get that dirty stick and shoot your favorite shooter with it

[Verse 1]
Fifty-one extendo, make a movie with it (Movie)
Thirty rounds in my Glock and I get groovy with it (Groovy)
Drip in the mirror, freshen the jer-, gotta pool my jewels with me (Jewels)
Facin' my peers, open my ears, now speak them jewels to me (Yeah)
Yeah, Mr. Blue Benzy (Yeah), I been stackin' up them M&Ms
Diamond blinged out (Burr), charge the power, up the price again
I heard they payin' high (How high?), 93, I dropped the price again (How low?)
See through my third eye, yeah, rackin' up them rapper tabs
Beep, beep-beep, that dude truck bringin' them packs again (Beep beep)
And we sit so deep got them 'cause all mine sent from Pakistan
Beep-beep, why the machine on broke again? (Boom)
Runnin' through them, bad papercuts all on my hands again (Ouch)
Longway

[Chorus]
I'm too legit, stick came with the coolin' system (Huh)
Fuck the justice system, man, my lawyer too official
This the trapper district, all we do is traffic chickens
I'm a mathematician, M&Ms in my tunnel vision
Yeah, I'm super lit (Yeah)
Yeah, we gookin' with it
Get that dirty stick and shoot your favorite shooter with it
Yeah, I'm super lit
Yeah, we gookin' with it (Yeah, I'm gookin' with it)
Get that dirty stick and shoot your favorite shooter with it (Longway, bitch)

[Verse 2]
What you gon' do when they come through gookin'? (What you gon' do?)
Move that brick like chop on goon
How many bodies you chopped on numerals (Chop)
Shooter get shot while you shit on the stool (Shop)
He snoozin', why he be lackin' on duty? (Why you lackin'?)
Instagram turnin' the shit to a movie (Movie)
Young nigga lurkin' and gookin' (Gookin')
Fade a nigga top like Boosie
I wanted the top from a groupie (Bitch)
When I'm rollin' and geekin' and gookin' (Rollin')
Stuck 'cause I'm rollin' on doobies
Don't 4-double-O like Juvie (Juvie)
I'm double-O seven with the uzi (B-r-r-r-ow)
Drop top coolin' tryna count a lot of moolah (Man)
Fuck nigga tweakin', I'll put one in your medulla (Boom, boom)
Real street nigga still eat cup noodles
I found out I was too legit when I was shootin' Rugers (Boom)
Red and black seats inside the Bent like Freddy Kreuger (Rah)
In the streets I'm still movin' like I'm-
Longway, bitch

[Chorus]
I'm too legit, stick came with the coolin' system
Fuck the justice system, man, my lawyer too official
This the trapper district, all we do is traffic chickens
I'm a mathematician, M&Ms in my tunnel vision
Yeah, I'm super lit (Yeah)
Yeah, we gookin' with it
Get that dirty stick and shoot your favorite shooter with it
Yeah, I'm super lit
Yeah, we gookin' with it
Get that dirty stick and shoot your favorite shooter with it

[Outro]
I'm too legit, stick came with the coolin' system
Fuck the justice system, man, my lawyer too official
