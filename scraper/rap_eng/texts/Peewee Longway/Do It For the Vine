[Hook: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Fuck her on the camera, she gon' do it for the Vine
Everybody switcharoo that hoe, that little bitch ain't mine
IPhone 5 ringing like a chat line
All these hoes calling, I just want that FaceTime
Fuck her on the camera, she gon' do it for the Vine
Everybody switcharoo that hoe, that little bitch ain't mine
IPhone 5 ringing like a chat line
All these hoes calling, I just want that FaceTime

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Little bitty bitches, they can't pay for my attention
Did I mention that I'm riding 'round with Mr. Bentley?
Who is that with me? It don't matter 'cause we switching bitches
Might as well bring your friend with you
We don't do the kissing, to make it and [?], got exclusive bitches
Popped the molly just like Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston with it
I.T. got a nigga taking jacuzzi pictures
Jump in the Lamb, put it on Tom Cruise
Damn, I'm just listening to the blues
Getting road head by a bitch, I mean two
Man, I'm too cool, man, my heart cold, froze
African diamonds, igloo

[Hook: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Fuck her on the camera, she gon' do it for the Vine
Everybody switcharoo that hoe, that little bitch ain't mine
IPhone 5 ringing like a chat line
All these hoes calling, I just want that FaceTime
Fuck her on the camera, she gon' do it for the Vine
Everybody switcharoo that hoe, that little bitch ain't mine
IPhone 5 ringing like a chat line
All these hoes calling, I just want that FaceTime

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
IPhone 5 ringing like a chat line
I got five bitches calling, switcharoo, they ain't mine, no
Jump on the wood, they catch a splinter
Leaving the hood, we in the Sprinter
Notebook on us, no amateur
They fucked me like animals
I ain't lying, no
Got me in grind mode
I looked up these nine hoes
I don't trust none of these lying hoes
Pulling up, suicide doors
Got my Rollie out the door [?]
The same coat that the bullet holds, .45
Dope clothes, I'm live
Handmade Balenciaga
[?] shaking it like [?]
Kush is my cologne
I'm smelling like a fresh harvest
I ain't attached to these bitches
I wanna see you fuck my partner
Sucking, fucking on the camera
I wanna see you win an Oscar
