[Intro: PeeWee]
Weed weed weed whole lotta weed

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I took my chance playing
There was money in that shit
I couldn’t over look it
I was getting that shit for cheap, I was getting that shit every week
I done sold a lot of weed, I done sold a lot of weed, I done sold a lot of weed
I took my chance flippin’ brick, I took my chance hittin’ licks, I took my chance with a lot of shit
I done sold a lot of weed, I done sold a lot of weed, I done sold a lot of weed

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway
Marijuana for sale, I done flew a thousand miles
West Coast trips, I done bought a thousand pounds
Skrt skrt, pull up in the SS, OG bag for sale
And the bricks got bales on the midget
Break it down on the digital scale
I went to school just to be a fuckin’ chemist
To break it down on the digital scale
Fish scale, Fish scale, Fish scale
No signature I get it in the mail
Still pull up kick door fuck 12
I got indo reefer for sale
San Fransisco Cookies for sale
Bet your ass I break it there
The weed I’m smoking is strong, the weed you smoking’ is eh

OG weed still my cologne, smell that shit all in the air

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I took my chance playing
There was money in that shit
I couldn’t over look it
I was getting that shit for cheap, I was getting that shit every week
I done sold a lot of weed, I done sold a lot of weed, I done sold a lot of weed
I took my chance flippin’ brick, I took my chance hittin’ licks, I took my chance with a lot of shit
I done sold a lot of weed, I done sold a lot of weed, I done sold a lot of weed

[Verse 2: Jose Guapo]
Took my chance in the streets
No matter how you put it ain’t gonna find too many niggas like wee
He get that gas in for cheap
All Bosses guarantee we gone eat, so we gone eat
Trials and tribulations can’t see my incarcerated
I can’t be a patient can’t be at grades
Ten toes flat for that money long
Fuck where its at nigga I’m running, running to it
Bags in and I’m running through em’
Racks nigga and I’m thumbing’ through em’
I shed blood sweat and tears for it, I got niggas down’ years for it

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I took my chance playing
There was money in that shit
I couldn’t over look it
I was getting that shit for cheap, I was getting that shit every week
I done sold a lot of weed, I done sold a lot of weed, I done sold a lot of weed
I took my chance flippin’ brick, I took my chance hittin’ licks, I took my chance with a lot of shit
I done sold a lot of weed, I done sold a lot of weed, I done sold a lot of weed
