[PeeWee Longway: Intro]
Longway Longway Bitch, She got the box (Touchdown)
Lets get it in
Longway Longway, all blue on my end

[Hook]
I let my bitches pipe up out the gate
Feastin', My dinner on Versace plates
I got my bitches Juugin' all the way
I got my bitches Juugin' none but weight
Longway Nino shoot you in your face
Rock-a-bye bay bay bay bay
Four different bitches call em bae
Got em standin’ at the skirt today, they talkin’ bout
I got your box wee, (Touchdown) The box just came wee
I got the box wee, the box just came wee
I got the box wee, the box just came wee
I got the box wee, the box just came wee

[PeeWee Longway: Verse 1]
50 Gas Bags on the way to Zone 3

[PeeWee Longway: Verse 2]
12 o’ clock mailman just dropped off the box
448 we catch Juugs off the clocks
1008 grams cut a brick in Versace
I make a bitch serve a nick out stockings
L.A. to the A, the boxes be comin'
When they intercept the box it smell like narcotics
Change my location then skrt’ skrt' in the Rari
Pull up wells fargo make Pablo deposit
Its 10 o’ clock 10 packs of Jackie Tan in
At 10:05 i sent the pics of the kick
That Nickelodeon I call it Nick Cannon
Quarterback that pack Touchdown like Madden
E.A. Juugin call me Longway John Madden
I flew New York caught the box of McFaddens
Hickory dish with Tilapia Salad
I got the box it was signed by your nat-nat
Pipe a bitch up got the juice like I’m Madden
Pocket monster tucked in my bitch panties
Gotta keep one cocked in head the dummy bag
Too many Blue Hundreds stuffed in my Fendi
Pull up to my spot, we serve it like Wendys
Serve that fish scale like we Trappin’ Bentleys
My bitch bring me boxes in breakfast like Dennys
Longway Bitch
