[Chorus]
VV my wrist, I put points on my neck
Come with that neck 'cause that pussy not nan'
Can't get enough flexin', let's pop through them bands
Perc pill popper, got the trap on xans
Bitch got a job, pussy poppin' for them bands
Pussy start poppin' when I pop through them bands
Rubber band keep on poppin' (pop)
Real shit, I damn sure ain't get enough money (real shit though)
I damn sure ain't get enough pussy
Shit I damn sure ain't get enough head, shit
Damn sure ain't get enough flexing, shit
Them pointers they lookin' baguettes
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, nah

[Verse 1]
Mr. Blue Benjamin, stackin' the tips 'til infinity
Crip blue the seats in the Lamborghini
I got the bop, make that bitch Houdini (voila)
We hit with the stanley steamer
Put that dope in the pot, made that bitch a Beamer
Pussy poppin' for papi, she Aquafina
When I whip with that wrist I whip up Katrina (who that is?)
Iced out my teeth like I'm Mike Jones
I don't even talk with the lights on
Pointers on baguette, got VV's on VV's
Fuck that lil bitch, I want RiRi's on TV
Step on them GG's, my shirt might be GG
Balmain my nuts and the bitch long guts
I pull up and bust it
Sippin' Act and that 'Tussin at, yeah
I want that giraffe, yeah, I want that neck (neck, that neck)
I want that check
Know what I'm talkin' about, I want that photo effect
When they through they gon' post him on next
'Fore I fuck her she know I want becky
With these bales on Boflex
I need hoes in both sections
Baby daddy in the broke section

[Chorus]
VV my wrist, I put points on my neck
Come with that neck 'cause that pussy not nan'
Can't get enough flexin', let's pop through them bands
Perc pill popper, got the trap on xans
Bitch got a job, pussy poppin' for them bands
Pussy start poppin' when I pop through them bands
Rubber band keep on poppin' (pop)
Real shit, I damn sure ain't get enough money (real shit though)
I damn sure ain't get enough pussy
Shit I damn sure ain't get enough head, shit
Damn sure ain't get enough flexing, shit
Them pointers they lookin' baguettes
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, nah

[Verse 2]
Ain't no gang, he can't come under the rope
I'm the plug, got the load on banana boat
In the club, put the stove on the cantaloupe
I serve my aunties and my uncle MC Hammer dope
Another homi, he been hit with DC sniper scopes
I make it lock up in the pot, kick it with dish detergent
Frank Lucas, watch it cost a bunch of birds
Swiper nigga, bitch he tryna punch the work (ayy mane)
Don't pull up, sound like a concert
Like a mail brick, ice on a t-shirt
Before we fuck, let me see what that mouth work (ayy)
Hop it chop, hold up stop it, stop it
Got 'em coppin' deuces when you pull up poppin'
I can't stop the flexin' so let's pop it then
4K TV when I'm backin' in
Zaxbys chicken when we sack it up
Gucci beanie, this that Donald Duck
Them bricks double up, come from overseas
Jeffery bag come with the double C's
Hold my lil stamp when I'm in her, uh uh

[Chorus]
VV my wrist, I put points on my neck
Come with that neck 'cause that pussy not nan'
Can't get enough flexin', let's pop through them bands
Perc pill popper, got the trap on xans
Bitch got a job, pussy poppin' for them bands
Pussy start poppin' when I pop through them bands
Rubber band keep on poppin' (pop)
Real shit, I damn sure ain't get enough money (real shit though)
I damn sure ain't get enough pussy
Shit I damn sure ain't get enough head, shit
Damn sure ain't get enough flexing, shit
Them pointers they lookin' baguettes
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, nah
