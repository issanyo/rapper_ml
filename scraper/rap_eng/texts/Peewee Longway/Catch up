[Hook]
Catchin' them packs on a Sunday
Wrappin’ them packs on a Sunday
Catchin' them packs on a Sunday
Wrappin’ them packs on a Sunday

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
Bustin’ on top of my Maison Margiela, nigga catch up
Bustin’ on top of my Maison Margiela, nigga catch up
Juugin’ that pack on a Sunday
Workin’ that pack on a Sunday
Juugin’ that pack on a Sunday
Workin’ that pack on a Sunday
Bustin’ on top of my Maison Margiela, nigga catch up
Bustin’ on top of my Maison Margiela, nigga catch up (need some ketchup)

[PeeWee Longway & Muddgod]
Bust a pack open, pass it like a offer
Keep the gas bags in a coffin
Bustin Margiela bought em look like Coffee
Gold on my neck like I’m King Joffrey
(Hashtag keep the feds off me
Walking lick when you see me walking
Ran that pack like Herschel Walker)
Stacks of that Granny before Bible Study
Walking in church with a clip hold a thirty
Praying on my knees for that shit I did dirty
Like Cooking a motherfuckin’ Bird on a Sunday
Auntie keep bringin' back and forth them junkies
(I’mma still serve bricks
3 bands for a feature
Nigga really don’t need ya)

Bustin’ on top of my Maison Margiela, nigga catch up
Bustin’ on top of my Maison Margiela, nigga catch up

Bustin’ on top of my Maison Margiela, nigga catch up
Bustin’ on top of my Maison Margiela, nigga catch up (need some ketchup)

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway & (MuddGod)]
Bomb landin’ like I’m Peyton on Sunday
(still runnin’ the packs out on Monday)
Flippin’ this work in a Vacuum Seal
I hit the trap with a Sunday Deal
Macaroni and cheese for Collard Greens
In the trenches with them drawn like its pork and beans
(president rollie my boogers green)
Trap spot filled up with felonies
Fishscale baggin’ up selling the work
I can get it gone one call on the twerk
(Lodgin' the work, gripping the work
Young nigga, I’m movin’ the work)
Fuck around make me intercept you like Dion
Longway Top Shottas don’t need fuckin Pions
Bust out Margielas look like Creon
Suspender dabbin on these

[Hook]
Catchin' them packs on a Sunday
Wrappin’ them packs on a Sunday
