Smoke good gas like Snoop Lion
I got boxes flying across grand canyon
I got homies and they creeping’ my zion
Longway the leo lion, serving’ if you buyin’
Thats a clean brick very flaw diamonds
Draped up full of gas of diamonds
Product of the block and I’m a product of the environment
Thinking like O dogg a menace II society

Peewee got the hookup okay

Used to juug it in the cafeteria every third period
Ring on every fuckin’ finger Mr. T my idol

Since a diaper Menace to society came up on a ?
Flip a niggas shit gone bust his head til the white meat
Ice cream mane cane the only thing that excite me
Mr peewee in the trap with dope boy Nikes
