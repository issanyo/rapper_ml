[Intro]
Lets get it
J nasty engineered

Keep one cocked too
I’m strapped and my engineer strapped fuck nigga

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I keep one cocked inside the head
And I'm a motherfuckin' felon
Ain’t the first to fill up, gas bags what I’m sellin
I got Skippers on my feet
You purchase fishscale we gon sell it (Get Off)
Overnight the narcs inside the box my plug just mailed it
Boy don't you tell it
Boy don't you tell it
Overnight the narcs inside the box, my plug just mailed it
Boy don't you tell it
Boy don't you tell it
I got skippers on my feet
You purchase fishscale we gon sell it (Get On)
I got bricks like I'm a vato go to work like I’m [?]
Pussy nigga tellin' tote that snitch I pick the Jewelry Up
Quarter million worth of Jewelry
Told the judge don’t tote no Burr
20 OG Gas Bags went and spent it on my ear

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
I work the choppa-later like a calculator when I juug
Every time I land in Cali they call me Longway Blue Sug
Thats the city, that I just mailed it, I’m the plug
Boy don’t you tell it
They say, she say, no comprende
I go Givenchy my slippers
Snatchin’ bricks up out the river
Call me Longway John Silver
I keep one cocked one Nasty Dealer
Longway one low-life ass nigga
Go on mouse shawty’
I make the snitches cry a river
Beat the blocks up out the building
2 gun shawty John Dillinger

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I keep one cocked inside the head
And I’m a motherfuckin’ felon
Ain’t the first to fill up, gas bags what I’m sellin
I got Skippers on my feet
You purchase fishscale we gon sell it (Get On)
Overnight the narcs inside the box my plug just mailed it
Boy don’t you tell it

Overnight the narcs inside the box, my plug just mailed it

Pussy nigga tellin’ tote that snitch I pick the Jewelry Up

[Verse 2: LoLife Blacc]
Hey I do dirt all by my lonely, cause these niggas they gone tell it
I just hit a lick, them bricks, I break em down then I sell it
Move them bricks daily, snitches get found just like brenda baby
In St. Louis, when them packs touchdown just E.I. like I'm Nelly
Havin’ paper work, I’m creeping’ just like Kane for them weights
Strip yo ass like Blue Flame, then we send ya home naked
To a snitch a lethal weapon pen a he the type to watch lethal weapon and then Danny Glover is his favorite detective
Boy don’t you tell it
Boy don’t you tell it
Beat you home be in yo yard then them pistols get to yellin’
I’m a convicted felon still ridin with it

[Hook]
