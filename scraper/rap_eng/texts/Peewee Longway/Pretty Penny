[Verse 1: Offset]
What the fuck a nigga mean what we doin'
Welcome to my world nigga
Got ya bitch on the molly and she chewin’
Offset, Longway and we going to Cali’
Got the pints in the mail shipped to him
The Euros, The Pesos, the guala
My nigga we ballin’ Patrick Ewing
Fuckin’ the models and poppin’ the bottles
Sippin’ Actavis make movies
Longway roll the doobies, Austin Powers we groovy
Don’t touch me bitch you got da cooties
My rolex diamonds look like loogies
With the hammer like I was Judge Judy
My young niggas they actin’ reckless
50 thousand for a necklace
I got more blocks than Tetris
Finnessin’ the plug so excellent
Got a Audi but thats not relevent
Guiseppe Stepper got me actin’ so arrogant
I’m a boss, ross voice, 50 acre math in’ golf course
Porsche truck whole lotta torque
Pulled your hoe off of my carport

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
Overnight shipping’ the package
100 bands spent on my necklace baguettes
Switcharoo she with the next
Fuckin’ Longway and offset
Just flipped the bricks someone tell me whats next
I look like a lick, a pretty penny
Dirty Harry, double down with Semi’s
Shootin’ shit nigga and handlin’ business
Leave your ass shot for takin’ with ya
Young Rich Nigga lookin’ like a pretty penny (Young Rich Nigga)
Young Rich Nigga look like a pretty penny, lookin’ like a pretty penny
Lookin’ like a pretty penny, Young Rich Nigga lookin’ like a pretty penny
Young Rich Nigga, look like a pretty penny, lookin’ like a pretty penny
Young Rich Nigga, look like a pretty penny, lookin’ like a pretty penny

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Dirty Harry double down 2 semi’s
You niggas 25, stay out my twitter mentions
Fuckin on I dream of Jeannie bitches
Switcharoo with offset eaten’ up the ticket
Forgiatos tune up the S5 deep dish
My swag literally from Italy
Tom Ford Givenchys them bitches didn’t drop yet
Cocaine rocks in my rolex
Sponsor a nigga muscle no bo-flex
Overnight package I’m playin overseas
OG Gas, No febreeze
Longway Bron Double R in South Beach
Blue Hundons in my pocket so neat
Papercuts don’t make me saw off yo feet
Hater repellent I’m sucker free
Raw cocaine got my trap house beatin'
Little bitty bitches so irrelevant
Drop it on the digi I’m sellin’ it
Sick so crip on my belly I’m bangin' it
Peek-a-boo diamonds
Piss on a bitch R-Kelly
Dougie Fresh fuckin’ in Baguettes
Switcharoo she with the next
