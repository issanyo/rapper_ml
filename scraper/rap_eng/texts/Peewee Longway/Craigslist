[Intro]
Cicero On The Beat
Cicero, what it do, nigga?
Say the engineer
What I say he go fixin' it
I’m back on my bullshit

[Chorus]
I put bars on the Craig list, fuck a fed list (Fuck a fed list)
All my gun got the chicken pox, I'ma spread this (Pop, pop, pop)
If you scared, holler redrum (Bitch), we shoot through red dots (B-r-r-rap-bap-bap)
All my guns got the chicken pox, I'ma spread this (Ho)
Pour my lean inside a red rock, diamonds bedrock
Pop a bean at a bitch spot, fuck her ’til she spout
Yeah, yeah, I'm tryna trap a spot (Trap, trap, trap)
Yeah, yeah, I'm tryna trap a spot (Trap, trap, trap)

[Verse 1]
Ice in a drought, money machines out, yeah
Ask me to talk, diamonds in my mouth, yeah
Them queens in the house, the king of the south (Know I'm sayin'?)
Now hold on they jump out the night, the pharmacy jump out the pot
Fuck on a bitch 'til she out, red rot with the snot (Snot)
Freddy Krueger with the ruger (Rah)
Hoes Jehovahs, get to knockin', ayy (Nah, nah)
Leavin' no witness, mafia (Nuh uh)
Beanie Sigel, State Property
I’m switchin’ up all my contracts (Contracts)
My gun got the chicken pox (The pox)
The pharmacy mom and pops (Hey)
I'm pourin’ up lean in a pop (My lean)
And a gauge, what I wanna pop (Ayy)
I'll get papi to meet at the dock (Ayy)
Bring me diamond, they reroute the rock (Reroute)
Check the nine millimeter right out the box
My lil young nigga pull up and pop it (Pull up)
I put fox on my shirt, on my socks

[Chorus]
I put bars on the Craig list, fuck a fed list (Yup)
All my gun got the chicken pox, I'ma spread this (Pop)
If you scared, holler redrum, we shoot through red dots (Da da da)
All my guns got the chicken pox, I'ma spread this (Bop, bop, bop)
Pour my lean inside a red rock, diamonds bedrock
Pop a bean at a bitch spot, fuck her ’til she spout (Uh)
Yeah, yeah, I'm tryna trap a spot (Trap, trap, trap)
Yeah, yeah, I'm tryna trap a spot (Trap, trap, trap)

[Verse 2]
I put bars on the Craig list
Got bad fish scale
Pocket deep like wishin' well
Blue hundreds, blue fifties and twenties (Yes)
Big bank, rollin', bendin' (Bendin')
All my clips extended (B-r-r-r-ap)
I want G-Star with my Fendi
I keep one cocked for my enemy (Bitch)
Stuck on the need I'm a gentleman
I skip over Givenchy they Gilligan (Ayy ayy)
I'm back on the dock like a fisherman (Ayy ayy)
Can't wait to get back to the skillet
Bubble on sizzle, double on fifty
How I'ma start countin' them Benjamins
Stackin' them figures, watch how I double the digits
One stop shop on the midget
Yeah, got Margie runnin' my ceilin'
It hard for me to stop dealin' (Huh)
Got Saint Laurent inside the Bentley
Got a pint of Wock on my kidney
Gotta catch the boss about the mission (Yuh)
Got a brick and they pretty like jiffy (Hey)
Gotta stick to me, spread it like instant (Hey, hey)
You get here you get slapped like a bitch
Longway

[Chorus]
I put bars on the Craig list, fuck a fed list
All my gun got the chicken pox, I'ma spread this
If you scared, holler redrum, we shoot through red dots
All my guns got the chicken pox, I'ma spread this
Pour my lean inside a red rock, diamonds bedrock
Pop a bean at a bitch spot, fuck her 'til she spout
Yeah, yeah, I'm tryna trap a spot
Yeah, yeah, I'm tryna trap a spot
Yeah, yeah
