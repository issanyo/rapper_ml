[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
Jumped off the porch going hard in the paint
Momma front yard where we serve the dank
Prescription card for the exotic like I’m in the Bay
I’m the colonel of the trap, shit No Limit tank
Back to the Traphouse, Back to the trap house
Back to the Traphouse, Back to the trap house
Back to the Traphouse, Back to the trap house
Back to the Traphouse, Back to the trap house

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Gotta get the work off juugin' when the mailman drop off
Got another quarter million in the post office
Paper cut count up in the dope house
My neck still screamin’ like a Soap Opera
Young nigga serving with hand choppers
Prescription drugs like a damn doctor
Master P with a new no limit tank
I fly them falcons Longway Arthur Blank
Im the one who that fed Guwop all them pints
Sippin and spillin' the lean tip we faint
Blue Benjamins smell like OG in the bank
My cousin got the vante got the OG bungee jumping from the A
To Columbus, KK, k
Back to trap,  where we work the Cali Juugin’ nothin but the Onions, kk
Jumped out the porch went hard in the paint
We strapping the Xanny Bars, and the Percs
My momma front yard where we put in the work
Trap that bitch out go bizerk, MPA money pounds and ammunition
Look at the flick of my wrist in the kitchen
Beat up the pot with the beater lets get it
Trappin and rappin’, G-s on the scale
When I Turnt myself in I smell like a whole bale
Longway Bitch

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Back to the trap house juugin' out my momma yard

Nigga pullin’ up with noise
Hand chopper call the bitch a hand saw
Pussy nigga pull my card turn a nigga to a Hell Cat tryna dodge
Back to the trap house with that Steven Segal, Sylvestor Stallone
Thats what you calling’ strong in the cone
I get that Backwood stuff-crust it
Back to the trap-house my mailman drop it off in a bucket
I get that package and I bunk it
Turn that neighborhood to California
Chargin 400 for 4 different ounces
Presidential Gas Cannabis, Louis 13, Cherry Pie, Sherbert Bag
I got em Best Buy
Back to the trap where we sell it out
Arm and Hammer egg beater in the pot
But my wrist again Mr. Whip-A-Lot
Residue in my rollie turn to Uncle Ice
Hit it, Auntie gon test it out
In the trap with them choppers no vests out
Play a game we gone stretch em out
Longway Bitch
