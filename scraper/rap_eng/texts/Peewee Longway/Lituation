[Intro]
808 Mafia
Damn, another lituation, man
Cicero On The Beat
Situation might get lit

[Chorus]
Damn, another lituation
Drop the top like Ronald Reagan, pull up on a situation
'Nother damn situation, another lituation
Drop the top like Ronald Reagan, pull up on a situation
Got another lituation
Another situation, 'nother lituation
Yeah, another situation, yeah, a lituation
This another situation, another lituation
This another situation

[Verse 1]
This right here a lituation, not a situation
Drop the top like Ronald Reagan, pull up on a situation
I got proof, Nicole Fegan, and I got thots that come from Asia
Panama and Venezuela, three new bitches named Mikayla
Louis Vuitton, calamari, gator, trap house in Decatur
Trap it out the calculator, I put bags on the equator
Put that dick off in her navel, that's another lituation
Lil' bitch keep screamin', "Ooh," that's it, screamin', "Ooh, he lit"
Switch, I throw assists
Two-tone the flick of my wrist
A situation might get lit
Level up on a lil' bitch, yeah
Forgiato with the liftkit
Trick-or-treat you just like Bushwick
Stick fire 'em like a lit Bic
Pull up on him with the hit-stick

[Chorus]
Damn, another lituation
Drop the top like Ronald Reagan, pull up on a situation
'Nother damn situation, another lituation
Drop the top like Ronald Reagan, pull up on a situation
Got another lituation
Another situation, 'nother lituation
Yeah, another situation, yeah, a lituation
This another situation, another lituation
This another situation

[Verse 2]
Gas bag stinkin', in the kitchen cookin' bacon
Julio them falcons, I go killer right from ravens
California raisin, I got seven different flavors
Lemon to biscotti, I'm the gingerbread baker
Two bricks on my bracelet, heroin brick look Beijing
Two-tone Rollie look Siamese, shine, got mileage from Chinese
Forgis gon' pull up on chopsticks, chop it
Trap house still on locksmith
Two gun dealers, just don't cop pistols
Kel-Tec when that opp miss us
Get litty on jigga, she pop pussy
It's litty again, she cock kissin'
A situation, we don't sprout with it
He spot like a bitch when that Glock hit him
I get you, they leakin' like Shotta
We get lit and go fuck on the models
We pour Act' in a piña colada
Get the pack and beat it like piñatas

[Chorus]
Damn, another lituation
Drop the top like Ronald Reagan, pull up on a situation
'Nother damn situation, another lituation
Drop the top like Ronald Reagan, pull up on a situation
Got another lituation
Another situation, 'nother lituation
Yeah, another situation, yeah, a lituation
This another situation, another lituation
This another situation
