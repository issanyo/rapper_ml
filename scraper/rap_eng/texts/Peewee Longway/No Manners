[Hook: K Camp]
These Hoes ain't got no manners, These Hoes ain't got no manners
These Hoes ain't got no manners, These Hoes ain't got no manners
That bag on me like Santa, That bag on me like Santa
That bag on me like Santa, That bag on me like Santa
These hoes don't meet my standards, These hoes don't meet my standards
These hoes don't meet my standards, These hoes don't meet my standards
These Hoes ain't got no manners, These Hoes ain't got no manners
These Hoes ain't got no manners, These Hoes ain't got no manners

[Verse 1 K Camp]
I got these hoes, I ain't talking bout shit
Steady creeping round in another nigga vip
Tryna' fuck for a bag thats it, I said these hoes
Be the same ones on instagram, think they they running things
When in person, bitch, she don't look the same
Playing niggas for the check, burning like a cigarette
Stay on the scene, but the mouth so mean she go bust like roulette
Really can't trust these hoes anyway
Take her to the bed, imma' hit her with the Hardaway
Feed her with pennies like my last name Hardaway
Heard you cuffing that, boy you really took the heart away

[Hook: K Camp]

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
These hoes don't meet my standard, blue benjamin sack like Santa
All blue on my head, bandana, lil bitch i ain't got no manners
Louboutin handkerchief to wipe up my bezel
Benzes and my Rollie is Pikachu yellow
Stendo my clip, nigga shooting at whoever
Goldie mouth pimpin' cause hoes I got several
Fuck your bitch under a Versace umbrella
Double R ghost, inside Versace
Bitch eat a dick for a plate of hibachi
Hanging with the lows, yea we rolling and rocking
On another note, look bitch I'm popping
Bitch I got bands in a Santa's stocking
Machine gun called chopper
Trap house, lean, lean, lean on a doctor
Smoke good gas like a rasta
Slanging OG gas no imposter
Toss out his bitch [?]
Bitch don't got no manners, we eat steak and lobsters
Giuseppe steppin' me and Neiman Marcus
100 bands on me in all my pockets
Pocket monster so don't pocket watch
Lost my mind on a molly rocket
