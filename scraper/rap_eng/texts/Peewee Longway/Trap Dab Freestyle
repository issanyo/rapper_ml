[Verse 1: Offset]
The work, it do magic like Criss Angel
I'm selling more chickens than Bojangles
We shoot the chopper from your head to your ankle
So many chains on my neck, they get tangled
I'm in Atlanta, sipping Texas Ranger
Too Atlanta 'cause my goons, you can't tame them
My niggas banging GD, twist your fingers
Mystikal .45, that bitch come with danger
So many bitches, they calling me gigolo
Got a fox on my back, not talking Vivica
All of these niggas, they mimicking
Most of the money got energy, whipping up chemicals
Swag is not usual
Devil on my back, fuck Lucifer
I'm trapping, capping all these cubicles
Never made honor roll
I'm at the top and you fell off like dominoes

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I lost my feelings for women
When I learned how it feel to thumb through the Benjamins
Due to the fact that my Rolex a fifty
Arm & Hammer like I'm John Henry
Professor Klump pockets, I'm a chemist
Racks on me like I'm playing tennis
A hundred thousand on my new Bentley
Another hundred thousand on my Breitling bezel
Gold like I’m Shabba on African, diamonds
Canary yellow like the sunset, shining
I'm selling 16's, ain't talking 'bout rhyming
I'm looking for droughts to change the climates
No comprendo, they come away and bought pesos
Got the clay and serve the folks, call it Clay-Doh
I think I heard my front door
Go get the scope, hundred bricks for Diego

[Verse 3: Jose Guapo]
Speaking of the yayo, Young Guapo, Young Guapo, he all about pesos
Switcharoo on your main bitch, me and my nigga, hell nah, we won't date hoes
You speaking about Christian Louboutin? Well, we get them in by the caseload
I'm a boss like Rozay, Young Guapo got niggas on the payroll
We used to it, not new to it, just stacking up the paper
Went from standing on the block to smoking OG in skyscrapers (top floor condo)
My niggas got beams, no lasers
Cavalli my jeans, ten chains on with a Versace blazer
Longway, bitch

[Verse 4: Peewee Longway]
Longway reloaded, blood on my blue Benjamin like a Crip runner, trap will blow his out
Balenci' Givenchy, I trap and dab
Five naked bitches give me bubble bath
Longway Nino Brown
Put my foot in the cage just to break a pound
I'm fiending for it, they want brown sugar
She sneaking and geeking on Sugar Hill
Bitches suck my dick, trying to get it shooting
Longway put the bitch out with the roof
Pablo my plug and the mistress blew me
Call the little bitch Susie Choosy
At the Chevron, rolling up a doobie
Taking pictures, this ain't no camera, you're a movie
Longway Bond, you too groovy
Longway Bond, boy, you groovy?
And my backwood stuffed crushed fruity
And I don't wanna fuck the bitch if she ain't cute
The bitch gon' juug me a Cuban
And my Rolex blue
Strawberry, vanilla, chocolate three scoops
My diamonds confused her
She think she on roofies
Diamonds from Africa, shout out from Frank Lucas
Fresh out the banana boat with my hooligans
We come for the dope and we come from Sinise
I make the white boy jump, my wrist a chemist
Now they bow down to me like I’m the minister
Chopping bricks at the penitentiary
Damn, a young nigga tripping
Over a hundred of them fucking with some bitches
Hold it down, these niggas snitching
I'm the reason why y'all niggas cripping
Young nigga do it for the hood
Chopper with a wood grain handle
Young nigga Bangkok, call me Hancock
The chopper still got you shaking dreadlocks
With your bitch in the film for the bedrock
Pussy ass nigga caught a case, said it's deadlocked
Turned around, shot him with the same Glock

[Verse 5: Quavo]
So you say you shot him with the same Glock
Young nigga feeling like 2Pac
Still will hit a nigga with the rerock
Worth about a Bentley and I'm riding in a tee-top
They go in a frantic, but don't panic
They calling me Quavo, the stick-them-up bandit
He wanted the chopper, I let them have it
We hop on the PJ, touchdown on Atlantic
Tried to hit the Sprinter, now it's bulletproof
Try to fuck a Migo, bet a nigga shoot
Deuce deuce, pocket rocket in the VIP booth
Now you wanna ask me what you do
Water diamonds like a swimming pool
Had to spend two thousand for Margiela shoes
Young Quavo whipping up the chemicals
Hell nah, nigga never finished school
SRT Audi, I'm dabbing and I got your bitch that wanna leave her junkies in it
Mama, she told me, "Go get the bitch", I put my wrist in the water, it started swimming
On the north side, we were really getting it, then I'm stepping and spinning it, Longway in it
We was roadrunning, fucking up the city, Migos, Pablo, Guapo, PeeWee independent
