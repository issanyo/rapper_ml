[Intro: Young Thug + Quavo]
Got bands in the Tonka truck
I mention he's fuckin' up
Got bands in the Tonka truck
Bitch, go!

[Hook: Young Thug (Quavo)]
Got bands in the Tonka truck (Tonka truck)
My bitch want me to keep it up (Keep it up)
I'm fallin' in love with her (I'm in love)
Quavo wanna fuck on her (Migos!)
He tell me to give her up (No!)
I tell him that's up to her
She tell me she don't wanna deal with him no more
Cause he used a spatula (No she ain't mine)
She a trapper girl!
The pots and the pans are her manager
She act like she don't like to cook it up
But I know how to handle her
But I know how to handle her
Her wrist got too much stamina
She act like she don't like to cook it up
But I know how to handle her

[Verse 1: Quavo]
She act like she don't like to cook it up (bitch, cook it up)
She bringin' in nothin' but extras, I'm in love
Her wrist like a 2-in-1, she whip like a machine
Me and Thug hit the plug, she workin' for the plug
Now she workin' for me and PeeWee
How many times I told you, bitch I want them M's, nigga
Get out my face, go, go in the kitchen
Cause Quavo don't wanna deal with you
When you're whippin' don't take them heels, don't take nothin'
And if you take my dope you gon' get killed
But forreal, bitch, swear to God I'll kill

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Speed it up, break it down, speed it up
She breakin' her wrist with a spatula
I'm in love with her, she got the formula
And it's up to her to give it up
Them birdies comin' in on dump trucks
She karate chop just like nunchucks
Thugger and Quavo won't fuck with her
But they go to her to give it up
My palms itchy like I'm sippin' on Tuss
Actavis, my penmanship is too cut
Colossal livin', man I'm sneakin' and geeking
And I manage my bitches, they know what's up
Bands, we rubber band double up
Giuseppe steppin', what the fuck is up?
Draped up in gold like my name's Shabba Ranks
A young nigga might pull up Bentley truck

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I pull up in Bentley, the windows tinted
Rolled 'em down and she noticed it
How many times have I told you
To roll up the weed and don't smoke the shit?
How many times have I told you
To stay down and someone gon' notice it
How many times have I told you
Don't knock the police but I told you to
How many times have I told you
Lil mama you super bad
She sufferin' succotash
Put Looney and Tooney on pots and pans
I am a street loadin' man
I wrap 'em up in saran
I think I'm the coolest man
Ever since I got in QC, fam
