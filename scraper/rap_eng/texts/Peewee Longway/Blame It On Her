[Intro]
Turn me down a lil bit
Oh, y-yea, he can ride
Matter fact pull up right there
Be at our address, ok?

[Hook: Young Thug]
Pick me a bitch and blame it on her (blame it on her)
Leave a snitch in the ditch, just blame it on her (blame it on her)
Can't blame it on bro, just blame it on her (blame it on her)
Miss my cameo, gotta blame it on her
Ok the 12 pull me over bitch, you know I got that cola bitch
You know I got that soda, I'm gon blame it on her
I say the 12 pull me over bitch, you know I got that soda
I'm gon blame it on her, I'm gon blame it on her

[Verse: Young Thug]
Mash off in that Jag
Hoes be like why the hell ya do that?
Keep come and get a real muthafuckin' flat
Last floor in the building, this sky path (it's tall as fuck)
Bitches just want all my riches
Bitches just want ride on inches
Bitches don't wanna fuck me no mo'
Bitches want fuck all my bitches
Bitches know I'm a casino
I buy the Indian Remi
Bitches know I'm not D Bo
But I'm ride round, and I'm getting it
My chick is juggin' me fo' they come out
This is the light show and yo hole a mouth
Got more bricks than a motherfu' house
And I cook well, I am a scout
Yes, yes, yes I’m leanin', little bae
Dear Peewee, you should meet Longway
You know DK my ace, no spade
Ballin like sports drinkin “Lean-a-rade

[Verse: Peewee Longway]
Bad bitch, solid as a rock, she got game for cops
Cocaine, catch it in the box, whip it in the pot
My guns in her name, O5-Glock, F&N gon' pop
She ain’t screamin out Longway name, even if the pig ass cop
Show her the nigga I shot
Fuck em baby, Bonnie and Clyde
In two foreign ass drops
Catch my nigga, baby rockaby
Fuck in the Longway broc
Gotta punish in the ill ring and watch
Traphouse been fuck a neighborhood watch
DC to gleeshy drive a block, throw a brick
Big screen need me, twelve ounce to a brick
Cocaine cowgirl Steal a clip for me
Ain't nuttin' humble for a betta OG
Buying up the whole strand, ain’t no shit, Peewee
That's a hell, count the neighborhood seaweeds
Whatcha got, let me see ya pocket boy, see Wee?
Racks on racks on that boy Peewee

Love the way she suck dick
