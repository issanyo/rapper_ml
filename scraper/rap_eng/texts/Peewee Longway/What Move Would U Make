[Hook: Takeoff]
When that hundred round drum at your face
I got one question for you, what move would you make?
If it’s a shootout in the club and you got your pocket rocket
I got one question for you, what move would you make?
What move would you make? What move would you make?
What move would you do?
Every move got to be a power move, momma said they watching you
What if the plug gave you a whole bag
And you remix it with dog food
What move would you do, If the plug told you he after you

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Young Takeoff, call me NASA
Young nigga, I know you remember him
Last nigga try to steal my Cuban link
His family do not remember him
Last nigga ran off in my trap spot
I’m tripping, ain’t nobody tried that
Boom boom boom! Pull out the FN, they having a heart attack
Graduated from quarters but I throw that work like a quarterback
Run with the sack like a running back
I keep the wood like a lumberjack
I turn your fitted cap to a snapback
If it’s a problem, we pull up undelay
You think you hard cause of that tat on your face?
You think I’m intimidated
What the fuck is you thinking, what move was you thinking bout making?

[Hook: Takeoff]
When that hundred round drum at your face
I got one question for you, what move would you make?
If it’s a shootout in the club and you got your pocket rocket
I got one question for you, what move would you make?
What move would you make? What move would you make?
What move would you do?
Every move got to be a power move, momma said they watching you
What if the plug gave you a whole bag
And you remix it with dog food
What move would you do, If the plug told you he after you

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
What move you gon make when that cutter spray?
Still gunning at you from the other day
Hundred round [drum ?]
Hundred rounds all in your face
Name hold weight, state to state
What move would you make, pussy this type of way
She get the beater, beat the cake Anna Mae
Leave it to Beaver, Givenchy, no laces
What move would you make?
Diving in the pussy, wetter than a lake
Beat it up, make that bitch Harlem Shake
Trap house shaking like an earthquake
Plug front me that dog food
Remix it up with that 88
Ooh kill em like Terio
Whip it up, bring it back, oreo

[Hook: Takeoff]
When that hundred round drum at your face
I got one question for you, what move would you make?
If it’s a shootout in the club and you got your pocket rocket
I got one question for you, what move would you make?
What move would you make? What move would you make?
What move would you do?
Every move got to be a power move, momma said they watching you
What if the plug gave you a whole bag
And you remix it with dog food
What move would you do, If the plug told you he after you
