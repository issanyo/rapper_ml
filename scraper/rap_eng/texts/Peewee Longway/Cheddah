[Chorus:]
Rock the world club and slipping through the mirror
Imma nigga get that cheddah
Set the work, fuck that, put it on a scale
Ya’ll nigga go get that cheddah
Rock the world club and slipping through the mirror
Imma nigga get that cheddah

[Verse 1:]
3 white bitches coming from our neighbourhood
Chase the pan chicken up, better than cheddah
All the complain about, and I can do stressing
Bitch, get the fuck out of my face

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Ya’ll rich nigga gonna go get that cheddah…stealing my food
Set the work up and put it on a scale
Every second count, paper cut at your throat
Set the work up, put it on a scale
Ya’ll nigga go get that cheddah

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Set the work up, put it on a scale
Ya’ll nigga go get that cheddah

[Outro:] [x3]
You’ll rich nigga chasing at the cheddah [x7]
You’ll rich nigga go get that cheddah
