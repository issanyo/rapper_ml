[Verse 1: Randy]
Between you and me it's a lot of dope in here
You want to find some bitches just look yourself in the mirror
Run up in your room, Randy mane is harder than the pavement
Syrup got me on Mars Randy Damon
Oh you just mad from the way that I came in
Boy my shit spark like a motherfucking caveman
Racing up the street, you and your mans is a creep
You ain't got nothing on your feet so get to stepping, boy you weak

[Verse 2:  SenseiATL]
Backwood full of Lucy catch me in the sky with diamonds
When it come to juuging and these bitches, I be sliding
Keep that thirty tucked, keep that dirty in my cup
Never quick to buck, I'm just getting to the bucks
Catch me in the field like I'm Barry Bonds
Keep my team fed, what the fuck is Ramadan?
You know that I'm the don, keep the cannon by my waist
Getting to this guap, I don't got no time to waste

[Verse 3: Larry]
Wake up in a presidential suite
We cash out then we pass out, I can't get no beauty sleep
Givenchy Air Force 1's, I got presidential feet
Oh Larry ain't bout this and that, baby what you mean
Suffer in the hot what I get for a steal
Shit that I'm on you can't sell it no pill
Not lending my effort, not working the deal
Throw on the jeans, and she copping them feels
Geeked up in the club, I can't remember my name
Ran them numbers up, they gonna remember my name

[Verse 4: PeeWee Longway]
Longway Larry League major league
50 p's selling coca leaves
Kel-Tec, bout 2 of em
Draco bullets, sting like bumblebees
Jose managing a couple keys
Our bitch bring the molly in her double d's
Private jet flying over seas
Givenchy sandals Longway, double d
You gon' get yourself [?]
Quattro Audi round with Larry League
Hop up out like a beetle [?] Longway felony
My young nigga serving the skeleton
Cocaine white won't Picasso will
They think a nigga going either way I sell to ya
[?] and press it
Longway Larry League like George Jetson
Wear them Balmains tight like Elvis Presley
State of the art all my accessories
Ferragamo on a wrist link
My shoe no slipper, with Omar the Director
Two gun dealers just still wild westin'
Longway Bitch!
