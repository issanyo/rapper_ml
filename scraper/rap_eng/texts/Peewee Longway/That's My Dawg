[Intro: Trouble]
What the fuck I look like lettin' you turn down my flavor?

[Chorus: Trouble & PeeWee Longway]
I been live as fuck since a young nigga, yeah
Who gon' fuck with him? who gon' fuck with him?
Stuck with 'em, bitch I’m stuck with 'em
Yeah, how you broke as fuck hatin'? don’t fuck with 'em
Who gon' fuck with him? who gon' fuck with him?
Who gon' fuck with him? who gon' fuck with him?
That’s my dawg nigga, who gon' fuck with him?
That’s my dawg nigga, who gon' fuck with him?

[Verse 1: Trouble & PeeWee Longway]
All my niggas shooters, who gon' fuck with 'em?
What I say for life and after that mean I’m stuck with you
Lil dog talkin' 'bout he fucked up, cannot fuck with him
I go'n and throw lil dog a zip, a buck fifty
Stay down and stack it up, flip it lil nigga
Thousand eight grams, split the brick with my nigga
Hollow points in the dick, emptied the clip
Bitch that’s my nigga, he trippin' I’m trippin'
Got the forty Glock, came with John Dillinger clips
Bust a whole pint, he gon' sip when I sip
Swappin' these bitches, gon' fuck when I fuck
That’s my partner but act like my motherfuckin' brother, let’s get it

[Chorus: Trouble & PeeWee Longway]
I been live as fuck since a young nigga, yeah
Who gon' fuck with him? who gon' fuck with him?
Stuck with 'em, bitch I’m stuck with 'em
Yeah, how you broke as fuck hatin'? don’t fuck with 'em
Who gon' fuck with him? who gon' fuck with him?
Who gon' fuck with him? who gon' fuck with him?
That’s my dawg nigga, who gon' fuck with him?
That’s my dawg nigga, who gon' fuck with him?

[Verse 2: Trouble & PeeWee Longway]
You might not understand him, he geeked up nigga
I don't give no fuck bout nothin', bitch I fuck witg him
Just tryna run that bag up nigga
Just can’t fuck with you fraudulent fuck niggas
You tryna have a hundred bitches
I”m tryna have a hundred crates
Youngster asked me could I visit
He in the feds ten straight
A hundred sticks, we call 'em switches
Seen a fuckboy get throwed in the ditch
I was six out here, fuckin' these bitches
Dick like Givenchy, limited edition
Longway bitch

[Chorus: Trouble & PeeWee Longway]
I been live as fuck since a young nigga, yeah
Who gon' fuck with him? who gon' fuck with him?
Stuck with 'em, bitch I’m stuck with 'em
Yeah, how you broke as fuck hatin'? don’t fuck with 'em
Who gon' fuck with him? who gon' fuck with him?
Who gon' fuck with him? who gon' fuck with him?
That’s my dawg nigga, who gon' fuck with him?
That’s my dawg nigga, who gon' fuck with him?
