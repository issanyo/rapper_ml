[Intro]
What a name, what a name
Whatta name, Whatta name

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
Fuck a nigga bitch ain’t wanna say her name
Gotta tell a nigga I was fuckin what her name
Pull up in a coupe blown’ gas out the roof
Got my hand on that motherfuckin what a name
Jackie Tan we bootin’ up on that what a name
Tussin nodding out like Eddie Cane
Floyd Givenchy steppin’ on what a name (Dab)
My right wrist get to whippin’ what a name

What a name, What a name, with that What a name, ooh (x4)

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Bring out all that dab, Givenchy stepping in them What a name

When I’m busting Juugs, got my hand on that what a name
Pie inside my Backwood, I’m just blowing out that what a name

I got Gas Bags Bags Bags, Longway doin’ the Diddy dance
Juugin’ Doin’ 40 Fish Scab, Longway got hippie gas
Fuck a What a Name Bitch with a California tag
I got California Dab, Crippin with Blue Rags
Bootin’ up with what a name bitch on that raw Jackie Tan
What a Name, What a Name, ain’t no boss just a fan
Ain't no boss with them lil' Xans

Oh I got that O-Dog and I whip it with my hand
Nigga turn to O-dog with that pistol in his hand

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
