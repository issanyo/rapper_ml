[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
Still breaking bread with the goons
Gotta ticket in the living room (mula)
We so high feel like we on shrooms
Bought the Rari with the missing roof
Please don't wake me from my Foreign Dreams
I buy rollies for the whole team
Christian Louboutin it's a murder scene
California Rari I'm in love with speed

[Verse 1: Dose]
LA out in Mc Queens walking slow motion
Sipping on that lean call it purple potion
Ain't worried about a nigga did it my way
Open up that rrari on the highway
Doin 160 made that Biggie sideway
Bustin' chicks every day like a fire day
I do it 365, 25/8 hey
And we got rich off that rock
Feelin' like A&J
AND OG trying to make some good music
Flash it only I got used to it
Bought the ice the AP just to flex on y'all
Feeling like my nigga Future made myself a boss

Still breaking bread with the goons

[Verse 2: PeeWee]
Plays off the iPhone
Sell mud out the styrofoam
Surrounded round shoots
Each trappin in Loub
Call me PeeWee Longway
Me 12 presidential rovers
And I'm swerving in the rarri
Hop on the deuce hello versace
Jimmy Choo space can't see nobody
Acting like they ain't never seen the Masi'
Baby girl want I'm a feed it the molly
Wanna know how I feel run around the lobby
Pop the body it's a flying object
'Cause that pretend us everytime I stop it
TV looking like cream
When you inch peel it's on me
The fuck you meanin' PeeWee
I'm talking bling bling bling
I got a bunch of Ri-Ri with me (wassup girl)
I'm buyin rollies for the whole team
She don't seem wicked on the foreign dream

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
Still breaking bread with the goons
Gotta ticket in the living room (mula)
We so high feel like we on shrooms
Bought the Rari with the missing roof
Please don't wake me from my Foreign Dreams
I buy rollies for the whole team
Christian Louboutin it's a murder scene
California Rari I'm in love with speed

[Verse 3: Dose]
Molly, molly, molly got me moonwalking
Skateboard no doughs on the Tony Hawk
Christian Loubies make my feet drop
We can't turn up no more we broking up
Riding back to back in no foreign car
Getting to the money like some superstar
You can see the ocean from my backyard
Party, party, party like it's no tomorrow
Party, party, party like it's no tomorrow
Codeine and rosay that's a ball
Still blowing on that Mary Jane
Started in the trap now we major league
