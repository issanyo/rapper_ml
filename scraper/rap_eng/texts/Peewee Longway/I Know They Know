I know I gotta watch these suckers they suspicious
I know they heard I dropped the ticket on the blocks of midget
I know these niggas know I'm punchin' bags like Sonny Liston

[Verse 1]
I know these niggas know I give two fucks

We got low lows High performance reefer drop off and pull up
I know they heard I pour six in liters I stay stoned and stuck
Cocaine cowboy break down bricks of ether wrist game double up
Double up on cocaine white raris I know they know wassup

Nigga try your luck, my main mama mia gone come shoot you up

The pyrex bowl I got a gift for that shit
Watchin' it bubble while breakin' my wrist
