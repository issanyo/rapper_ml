[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I made a million dollars off my old house (Old House)
You play with Gucci money and head blowed off
My plug he serving’ heads he throwed off
Lil’ junkies in my hood still call me gold mouth
Gold Mouth, Gold Mouth
I juug a thousand pounds out my old house
Gold Mouth, Gold Mouth
Naked bitches cookin’ dope we throwed off

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]

Sold a hundred bales of mid out my Auntie closet

Made a million at the old house trappin' them bales off

Say rude boy mixed with some Sicilian
Bitches in the kitchen still pluck pidgens
