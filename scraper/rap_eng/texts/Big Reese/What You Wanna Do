(verse 1:)
Forget about your man, cuz he can't do it like i do it
Shawty i got a plan a special way to make you lose it
And i dont give a damn who sees us if we get caught
Cuz i been waiting so, so long to break you off

(hook:)
Cuz he dont know ya like i know ya and that for sho
Girl,he can't show you what i show ya and that's for sho
Why are you here if you don't what it, jump on it
I make your dreams come true
Girl its up to you

(chorus:)
Cuz you got me on the one to tonight so baby please don't play with me, yeah in know you
Gotta man in your life no disrespect but that ni**a ain't me

So im asking you
What you wanna do, what you wanna do, what you wanna do, wha wha what you wanna do
