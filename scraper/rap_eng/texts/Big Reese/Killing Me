(Verse 1)
Am I being pulled from across the room
I can feel her watchin me
But I'm playing cool, me and my dudes
Tryin' not to spill my drink
And she's showing me her tongue ring
Dying to get my attention
Just then I hear my phone ring
It's my nigga, he's callin' a mission

(Hook)
She's a devil in a dress
Dressed to impress
The best of the best hustlas
Ain't no telling how many she corrupts
Run up, try your luck
She might steal ya heart from ya
She's a devil in a dress
Dressed to impress
The best of the best hustlas
Ain't no telling how many she corrupts
Run up, try your luck
She might steal ya heart from ya

(Chorus)
Oooh she won't let me get away
I think I hear her body callin' me
She's about to make that move
What am I to do, she's killing me
She just wanna break me down
Work that round, my eyes can see
She's about to make that move
What am I do, she's killing me
She's killing me
She's killing me
She's killing me
She's killing me
She's killing me
She's killing me
She's killing me

(Verse 2)
Damn, what I'm supposed to do
She got me cornered in the club
And all the homies watching me
She got me nervous now
I can't look her in the face
Them pretty eyes see right through me
Oooh I know she ain't no good for me
And this ain't where I wanna be
I think I like it
Oooh and I don't wanna like it, oh

(Hook)
She's a devil in a dress
Dressed to impress
The best of the best hustlas (Yeah)
Ain't no tellin' how many she corrupts
Run up, try your luck
She might steal ya heart from ya (She's)

She's a devil in a dress
Dressed to impress

Ain't no tellin' how many she corrupts

(Chorus)
Oooh she won't let me get away
I think I hear her body callin' me
She's about to make that move
What am I to do, she's killing me
She just wanna break me down
Work that round, my eyes can see
She's about to make that move
What am I do, she's killing me (Oh yeah)
