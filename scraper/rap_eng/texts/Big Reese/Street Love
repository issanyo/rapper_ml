[Intro]
Street love
(Street love, street love, street love)
(Street love, street love)

[Verse 1]
I knew it from the first time you said hello, that you were special
We come from two different worlds' girl I know, but just cuz I'm hood
It don't mean that I'm out here trying to get with every girl
I'm just looking for that someone who I could give the world
Please don't judge me baby, look in to my eyes
I ain't playing with you
Girl I got to get you

[Chorus]
Baby your heart is safe with me (Oh yes it is)
Let me show you what love suppose to be
Girl I wanna to give you, all of this street love
I wanna give it, all of this street love
Baby your heart is safe with me
Take all of my street love

[Verse 2]
Baby I don't wanna to have to let go, just let me hold you
Your homies say I'm no good I'm ghetto, but just cuz I'm hood
It don't mean that I'm out here trying to get with every girl
I'm just looking for the someone who I could give the world
Please don't judge me baby look in to my eyes
I ain't playing with you
Girl I got to get you

[Chorus]
Baby your heart is safe with me  (baby your heart is safe with me)
Let me show you what love suppose to be  (I want to show you love, I want to show you love)
Girl I want to give you all of this street love (every little bit of it)
All of this street love (baby your heart)
Baby your heart is safe with me (with me, with me)
Take all of my street love


[Breakdown]
(Baby don't you hold back don't you want to give it)
Just want to give you all my love (baby don't you hold back don't you want to give it)
This is how I feel about you (baby don't you hold back don't you want to give it)
Even though we come from two different worlds (baby don't you hold back don't you want to give it)
There's something real about you (baby don't you hold back don't you want to give it)
Girl, don't be scared to follow your heart (baby don't you hold back don't you want to give it)
(Baby don't you hold back don't you want to give it)
Ill never ever hurt you, you deserve me (baby don't you hold back don't you want to give it)

[Chorus]
Baby your heart is safe with me
Let me show you what love suppose to be (girl I just wanna give you)
Girl I want to give you all of this street love
All of this street love
Baby your heart is safe with me
Take all of my street love

Baby your heart is safe with me
Let me show you what love suppose to be
I want to give you all of this street love
All of this street love
Baby your heart is safe with me
Take all of my street love..
