Know what Im sayin
Life is like a game of basketball
They just want niggas to run jump and shoot

Chorus:

The game, of life, is a struggle to survive
We live, to win, cause if we lose, than we die

Verse 1:

Whats the word for the day homeboy
It ain't nothin but this killin shit
Tryin to get this money right quick
You know how it is
Nigga tryin to eat food and live, smoke weed
Payin rent on my crib so I can breathe
Life is not about the quickest speed
What you achieve
Come degree by degree
And what you get is what you see
In your mind visually
And manifest physically
If you stick to it shitll work out terrificly
Take me, everyday my life be hectic and stressful
Never really know if ima ever be successful
But the best things you get out of life require struggle
If it dont you gettin hustled homeboy
You gettin hustled
How I see it
Anything you wanna be you can be it
If your mind can preceive it
And your heart really believe it
Than you half way there and all you got to do is do it
And if you give it all you got there ain't really
Nothin to it

Chorus

Score, this ain't no game this is war
Score, this ain't no game this is war
Score, this ain't no game this is war
Score, this ain't no game this is war

(talking in background)
Get your fucking heads in the game, please!
This season dont mean nothin if we lose this!
Word up

Verse 2:
As a, black boy
Started out a bundle of joy
But quickly I grew playin with toys
Than you started makin noise as a youth
Tryin to figure out the truth
Behind the shit that the schools ain't tellin
First come rebellin, then come drug sellin
Juvenile court, cause you too young to be a felon
Knew that everything around you was yours
But you gotta maintain the game of wealth that the
World has in store
A wise man told you before
You got the power to bring things to life black boy
You can test it
Everything you see is just a thought manifested
But before you had a chance to know that
You got arrested
And it all seems clear to you know, you can breathe
It was different
When you couldn't see the forest from the trees
If you follow your dreams you can accomplish anything
If you always do your best then your destiny is king
Of the world

Chorus

People dont let life, no no
Dont let life mislead you
You have the power

People dont let life
Dont let life deceive you
You have the power

Yeah, score this ain't no game this is war
Score, this ain't no game this is war
Score, this ain't no game this is war
Score, this ain't no game this is war

Verse 3:

Life is like twistin a blunt, its how you roll with it
Just figure out what you want and go and get it
Anybody tryin to stop you
For tryin to do for you
Thats your enemy dun
The sun be right up in your crew

Thats true
Life is a thinking mans game
Use your head for it
Ain't no use in bein scared a shit
If you prepared for it
Go for what you know good
This whole wide world is your hood
Plus the universe
Cause you was on the planet first

Score, this ain't no game this is war x4

Chorus

People dont let life, no no
Dont let life mislead you
You have the power

People dont let life
Dont let life deceive you
You have the power
Just use your power

Dont be a fool
Dont ever lose your cool
You got the power
