We came from the distant land
Our lives already planned
We came in ships from across the sea
Never again home at sea
And now we’ve become
American fool
With African Rules

Don’t be following no bull shit
Cause bull shit will get you killed
Real shit will get you killed
But bull shit will get you killed for sure
