[Verse 1: M1]
Militant and political, Guevara M1
I’ll wipe the smile off you many mouths, melt like a gun
And I remember '99, going on tour with Big Pun
Getting this fast rap cash from them six-week runs
See, I done learned from them generals with wild entourages
Fucking like rabbits but don't want to be fathers
Fucking up their hotel room, stay on some star shit
Know your role, play you position—rule 4
A jewel from the five-point crown that was passed down
That my comrades deep in the ground used to live for
Shoot up your crib for.  My life I would give for
So bury me a RBG in my six-fold
You know you can't fade it.  It's gang truce-related
We bang for change—it ain’t no game, you can't hate it
I want to slap Bush and his mammy for how he did
The Haitians in Miami—that's my fam.  Coupe tet boule kay
So please die, cracker, die.  That's for
Twenty-two generations of genocide
You see, that's why we get high: just to get by
So we sit and wait until it's dark outside and then we ride
On our enemies.  You can depend on me
If you a pig, then you can't be no kin of me
See, it's been thirty-three years since Fred been gone.  He was murdered
On the same day Jay-Z was born.  For real
12-4-69.  Same year
When they take one from us, then another appears
We gon' take this time to commemorate
NRD: National Revolutionary Day

[Hook: M1] (x2)
Say, “I am (I am) a revolutionary (A revolutionary)”
