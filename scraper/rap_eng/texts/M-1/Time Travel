[Hook]
I just wanna time travel, to know what I don't know
I just wanna time travel, to know what I don't know
See what I wanna see, feel what I wanna feel
Be what I wanna be, I tell ‘em what’s right and what’s real
See what I wanna see, feel what I wanna feel
Be what I wanna be, I tell ‘em what’s right and what’s real

[Verse 1]
I'm Zen'd up and I'm zoned out, tapped in to my own route
Wake up in the morning, throw my sneakers on, hit the streets and go all out
Beat the concrete, magic carpet
Through the neighborhood, through the projects
Getting them miles in and pass the college
No withdrawals without deposits
Feel that wind on my face, I'm Tommy Smith in '68
Fixed up, touch the sky, feels great, natural high
Sweat dripping down the block, healthy life, I’m out the box
When I run I'm in bliss baby, feel so good I don't wanna stop
Free my lungs of that marijuana, get my burn like a marathoner
Sunday hotter than Arizona, time travel anywhere I wanna
(I’m a long distance runner)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All seeing, all knowing, so free and mind blowing
Omnipotent, magnificent, liberated, feel mad different
We all talented, all gifted, tap into this raw spirit, it's unlimited
So call it a vivid suspension, expansion another dimension
Free from the box that we're trapped in
We bout to blast off, are you strapped in?
T minus and counting, imagine the ocean, the deserts
The glaciers, the clouds and the mountains
(See what I wanna see, feel what I wanna feel
Be what I wanna be, to know what’s right and what’s real)
Invincible, unshakable, earth quaking but unbreakable
Unstoppable, don't stop until there’s no rock a few, now I got the joke
I come from the jungle, I drink from the fountain
I looked and I found this, as innocent Roberts
Who died and backed out to the big bang
15’s of guap, we doing big things
(Until the fat lady sang)

[Hook]

[Interlude]
I'm Zen'd up and I'm zoned out
I tell ‘em what’s right and what’s real
I'm Zen'd up and I'm zoned out
I tell ‘em what, I tell ‘em what’s right and what’s real
I'm Zen'd up and I'm zoned out
I just wanna time travel, to know what I don't know
I'm Zen'd up and I'm zoned out
I just wanna time travel, to know what I don't know

[Verse 3]
Still evolving, adapting, changing
Time is moving, let’s embrace it
Past conditions, forward motion
Pour libation, the way it’s open
Ancient wisdom, the tribe has spoken
Let the circle be unbroken
Eye of Horus, wake the Buddha
Mayan calendar – see the future
Higher consciousness, revolution
Evolution, to better humans
God particles, spirit molecules
Science terms for what our G's already knew
Hieroglyphics, ancient temples
Know our self, infinite potential
Boundless options beyond the doctrines
We are the universe, break your boxes
(Let’s go)

[Outro]
I'm Zen'd up and I'm zoned out
