[Hook x2]
I be chasing a million
Fat back and my lady Brazilian
One day I be cruising in a X5
Money in the back and a girl on my left side

{Verse 1]
I'm just tryna make a million
Brown skin babe and her hair be Peruvian
Cruising round in my X5
Money in the back and the girl with the thick thighs
I'm a sick guy with my flick knife
A1 ain't gotta tell me to think twice
But I ain't on the road shit
I'm tryna make my money flip like a dolphin
Girls on the road wanna stop me for a chat
Give her ten seconds like I'm taking a snap
Coz I'm out here tryna double up my stack
I ain't going home coz my stack looking fat
I used to leave the hoiuse looking kind of bummy
Now they take this turn coz I'm married to this money
Nigga try and sleep with me and that weren't even funny
Now they wanna bus round me coz they end up getting honeys

[Verse 2]
Bad girl been telling me she like me (what?)
Uh uh, she could never be my wifey (no)
Need a ride or die girl beside me (real)
A girl with the ting in her bag to try and side me
Thick girl moving swift in my section
Ain't she, ain't got gigs but we flexing (yeah)
And let her boy try me I finesse him (trust)
I got money on my mind no need to be stressing
I got one ting called (?)
She (?) like Bradgelina
No talking when I meet her
It's only "Bye bye's" when I leave her
She be gassed over and moving like (?)
Spoke to her once now she's up in my ringtone
Told her how look at you go
Now this girl showed me how she do her lim(bo)

[Verse 3}
One day on the beach no stress
All my niggas so calm flexing in the white vest (ok)
I be chasing a mil
And a light skin lady coming from Brazil
Lock it off if that pussy boy vex me
Thick round back and her body kidna sexy
Batty so live, she moving so deadly
I told her back it up like she didn't have memory (yeah yeah)
But I'm focused on the paper
Killing every scene, I couldn't find a saviour
She ucked me kinda messy, I couldn't even name her
She on me kinda Messi, I couldn't even Neymar
Uh, won't catch me in Armani
But you gon' hold something if you fucking with our money
I just want a set pace no drama
Body like heaven, she a devil wearing Prada
