[Intro]
Yeah, gotta get that thing up, you know?
Bruce Lee say, "Do or do not do"
Like that... you know... gotta get some discipline
Stop smokin so much weed, some of these bad habits I got
You know, on the wall at Warrior Studios, it's like here it's posted up, you
Know
These 5 elemenents... rock it with me, yo I said

[Hook]
I said, Do, or do not do
Do, or do not do
Do, or do not do
These are the 5 elements, now it's up to you
[X2]

[Hook]
50 in the clip, can't let my fitness slip
RBG for life, these are the 5 elements
50 in the clip, can't let my fitness slip
RBG for life, these are the 5 elements

[Verse 1]
50 in the clip, can't let my fitness slip
The first element is "power", 10 on the fist
The second element represent "inner strength"
Symbolized by a 10 clip on the fingertips
The third element is "justice"
And it's symbolized by a 10 clip on the wrist
The fourth element is "wealth"
The hands connect in the shape of a diamond, you do 10 reps
The fifth element is "support"
Symbolized by a 10 clip done with my palms on the floor
"Power" is realizing your strength
"Inner Strength", controlling yourself
"Justice", principles, protocols and codes
And rules and regulations we all should know
And "Wealth", we gotta boss up, economic values
I have "Support", you for me, and me for you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I do this for my comrades, I do this for my people
I do this to stay on point for everything that we do
I do six sets of sit-ups, a six-pack
To counteract, the six of Heiny's I threw back
I go out like a 12-round knockout, takin the title bout
Keeping it tone like Roy Jones
Came up like a sit-up, or that Henny I spit up
On my fight, I'm not a punk or a quitter, nigga so get up
And keep your nails clipped so you can bust them in the lip
Keep your pants on your waist, so you can kick them in the face
Keep your shoes laced, so you can beat them in the chase
Can't afford to slip, it's no restrictions...

[Hook x2]
