You're the operator
Dial my name and number if you want to get to know me
Ain’t nothing to be afraid of
You're the operator
Dial my name and number if you want to get to know me
Ain’t nothing to be afraid of

[Verse 1: M-1]
It's like
You ever hear the echo on the phone
Look behind you feeling like you ain't alone
No paranoia you ain't out of your dome
Yes they invading your house
And if you're really looking for Assata Shakur
She right here, it's me hon'
2Pac over here having a beer, cheers
A toast to a lovely revolution
What's hush hush they know what we doing
They oppressing, we resisting
Ain't no justice in the system
Don't nobody want to be a victim
What's the big secret?
Guess I just have to leak it
I ain't just me please believe it
Everybody wanna be free
Just keep it to yourself
You ain't heard it from me
Everybody wanna be free
Just keep it to yourself
You ain't heard it from me
It's confidential

[Hook: Raye]
You're the operator
Dial my name and number if you want to get to know me
Ain’t nothing to be afraid of

[Verse 2: M-1]
I see you looking at me
I'm looking right back
I just want to fight back
It ain't like that
Incriminate me like I'm doing a crime
Ain't got no rights 'cause you violating mine
If you know then you know
If you don't then you don't
Some folds will and some folks won't
Straight G code, something that ghetto (?)
I may look dumb but I'm really from the old school
Revolutionary, not an old fool
I be the first one saying I told you
I'm out here to rub it all in
Pick up the phone and say hello to my little friend
Stop acting so anti-social
And let the next door neighbor get to know you
Meet Mr. All-Up-In-Your-Business
Feel the same way
Can I get a witness

[Hook: Raye]
You're the operator
Dial my name and number if you want to get to know me
Ain’t nothing to be afraid of
You're the operator
Dial my name and number if you want to get to know me
Ain’t nothing to be afraid of

[Verse 3: M-1]
And if you on the phone homie
We ain't alone homie
I put a dollar on it
Please don't holler on it
Cause you might end up on the list
If there's even a list
Still, the rumors exist
Its a big conspiracy with a twist
And they calling you a terrorist
If you put up your fist these days
So before they start looking up folks
For rocking the boat
It was me knocking the vote
It was me on the back of the smoke
And I ain't talking about dro
It was me that was sparking the loc
For my seeds, Imma be the one stopping the hoax
It's for more than just chilling when we copping them (?)
And you know why they be repping them shows
That be confidential
Cause they mention what the people should know
They just want to be in control
So you can be in the hole
Shh it's confidential

[Hook: Raye]
You're the operator
Dial my name and number if you want to get to know me
Ain’t nothing to be afraid of
You're the operator
Dial my name and number if you want to get to know me
Ain’t nothing to be afraid of

[Outro: (?)]
The U.S. government has once again openly declared war
Against the poor and oppressed people of the world
Once again this declaration has come in the form
Of this one million dollar bounty which rests on the head
Of not only Assata Shakur, but our movement
Because the most important thing about the bounty that
They placed against Assata Shakur who they call JoAnne Deborah Byron, is that she represents a struggle
