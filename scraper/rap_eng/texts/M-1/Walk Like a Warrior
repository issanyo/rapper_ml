Walk Like a Warrior
Walk Like a Warrior

I was trained to defend myself for my brain and my mental health
The white man got the wealth we held back
We're living in hell black and niggas can sell crack
But that ain't gonna change this thang
If you gonna bang, then bang for change, don't bang for crazy thangs
If not don't bang
If ya gonna ball play the game how it should be played
Can you dribble a grenade?
To save your life you payed the price, mama raised you right
Now how you ain't gonna fight?
For the white man's laws hell nah
For the cause, because we got to get what's ours
Gotta struggle for the motherfucking power
Cause we're livin' in the last few hours
It's 11:59, I think it's bout time
We get on the grind, and get out the carbine
With freedom of mind we can see what we can find
If you can spot 'em, pop pop pop the po-9
This is only a rhyme so now don't get scared
Listen to the message in the word
Don't let your sight get blurred, you heard this righteous words
You might prefer it from a cotton mouth
Timeout, I didn't say bug out, ball out, bling out
All y'all sell-outs get the hell out
This shit it's RBG so bang on out
Uh, we people army nigga, bang on out

Yo, Yo, what you know bout hard?
Can't be the weak link in the squad
Gotta look way deep in your heart
Anything in the way gotta go straight through
Take charge
Can't hide from your flaws when you ride for the cause
Cause a nigga will pull your card
Keep your guard up 24/7 on the street like you're doin hard time on the yard
What you know about hard?
Can you assemble your heat in the dark
Take it apart, and clean all the parts?
Life is a journey, a course, like learning a martial art
You can't have partial heart
Gotta get your own, if you drop the bone, dog, we all fall
It ain't over til the problem solved
Get your back up off the wall

[Bridge]
My niggas is riders, we fighters, we tight as a fist
RBG's up in this bitch, so bang on out
If your khakis is sagging, you repping your rag and you holding the magnum
Use it for freedom nigga, bang on out
All my dirtiest dirties, revolutionaries and visionaries
Don't be no scaredy nigga, bang on out
It's a war going on in the streets, we hollering fuck the police
Ain't bout no peace, nigga, bang on out

[Krayzie Bone]
Letâ€™s say you see fifty niggas in all black fatigues
My regime running down your street
At the end of the block, we got the god damn cops
And they hope we sink, tell me what you see
I see blood, buildings burning, motherfuckers trippin for a goddamn purpose
The police is nervous, cause we done observed 'em
Now niggas is thinking about murder
We ain't talking, no more, and we ain't squashing shit with po-po
And we ain't marching in the middle of the goddamn road
'Cause Martin got smoked
Niggas ready for war, so get the fuck up, we fixing to set the city to fire
This time when we ride we burning it down, turn this shit 'round
Keep your justice, your peace
And keep busting your heat, aim it at the crooked officer
We won't stop blazing til they coughing blood
Wanna slang my baseball cap to the back and get busy, nigga
You say you a soldier, well get over here nigga we under attack
As soon as they done, they dead gone
Murder mo come, come, they done, me redrum, me redrum, they done
And when we put 'em in they grave
We toss in a doughnut, and tell 'em we don't surrender, surrender, naw

[Hook]

I ain't talking bout no hustla
I ain't talking bout no gangsta
I'm hollering at them soldiers
Revolutionary culture
Bang on out
