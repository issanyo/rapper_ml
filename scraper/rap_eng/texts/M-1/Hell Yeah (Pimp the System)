Holton Street
Dean Street, click clack
President, uh huh
Nostrand Ave, DPz
Orange Ave, RBGs
Tee Town, who wanna ride
Brooklyn, come on, come on

[Verse 1]
Sitting in the living room on the floor
Hunger pang got me on some migraine shit
But I'm gonna maintain
Nigga got two or three dollars to my name
And my homies in the same boat going through the same thing
Ready for a caper, better plot for the paper
We been living in the dark since April
On the candle, gotta get a handle
My homie got a twenty-five automatic added to the camper
Nigga get the phone book look up in the yellow page
Lemme tell you how we gonna get paid
We gonna order take-out and when they send the driver
We gonna stick the twenty-five up in his face
Let's ride, stepping outside like warriors
Head to the notorious Southside
One weapon to the four of us
Hiding in the corridor until we see the beams from the car headlights
White boy in the wrong place at the right time
Soon as the car door open up he mine
We roll up quick and put the pistol to his nose
By the look on his face he probably shitted in his clothes
You know what this is
It's a stick up
Gimme the do' from your pickups
You ran into the wrong niggas
We running down the block hot with these stacks of boxes
So we split up and met back at the apartment

[Hook]
Hell yeah! - Yo ain't you hungry my nigga?
Hell yeah! - You wanna get paid my nigga?
Hell yeah! - Ain't you tired of starving my nigga?
Hell yeah! - Well lets ride then!
Hell yeah!
Hell yeah!

[Verse 2]
I know a way we can get paid you can get down but you can't be afraid
Let's go to the DMV and get an ID
The name says you but the face is me
Now it's your turn take my paper work
Like 1, 2, 3 lets make it work
Then, fill out the credit card application
And its gonna be bout 3 weeks a waiting
For American Express
Discover Card
Platinum Visa, Mastercard
Cause when we was boosting shit we was targets
Now we just walk right up and say charge it
To the game we rocking brand names
Well known at the department store chains
We even got the boys in the crew a few things
Po Po never know who to true blame
Sto' after Sto' you know we kept rolling
Wait two weeks report the car stolen
Repeat the cycle like a laundry mat
Like a glitch in the system it's hard to catch
Coming out the mall with the shopping bags
We can take it right back then get the cash
Yea, get a friend and then do it again
Damn right that's how we paid the rent

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I know a caper
We can get some government paper
You know food stamps can we really do that
Hell yea, right there for the taking
Fuck welfare we say reparations
And, you know the grind
Get up early get in the line and just wait
Everybody on break that's part of the game
And when they call your name
Ms. Case Worker let my state my claim
I'm homeless, jobless, times is hard
I'm bout hopeless
But I gotta eat regardless
No family to run to I'm twenty two
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
My sad story made her feel close to me
I made her feel like it was an emergency
When I came to the crib niggas couldn't believe
I came back with a big bag of groceries, hell yeah

Every job I ever had I had to get on the first day
I find out how to pimp on the system
Two steps ahead of the manager
Getting over on the regular tax free money out of the register
And when I'm working late nights stocking boxes
I'm creeping their merchandise
And don't put me on dishes I'm dropping them bitches
And taking all day long to mop the kitchen shit
We ain't getting paid commission, minimum wage, modern day slave conditions
Got me flippin' burgers with no power
Can't even buy one off what I make in an hour
I'm not the one to kiss ass for the top position
I take mine off the top like a politician
Where I'm from doing dirt is a part of living
I got mouths to feed I gots to get it

[Outro x2]
If you claiming gangsta, then bang on the system
And show that you ready to ride
Till we get our freedom
We got to get over
We steady on the grind
