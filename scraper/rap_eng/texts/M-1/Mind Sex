[Hook]
It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation

[Verse 1]
Pardon me, love, but you seem like my type
What you doing tonight? You should stop by the site
We could, roll some weed, play some records and talk
I got a fly spot downtown: Brooklyn, New York
Now I know you think I wanna fuck, no doubt
But tonight we'll try a different route
How bout we start, with a salad, a fresh bed of lettuce with croutons
Later we can play a game of chess on the futon
See, I ain't got to get in your blouse
It's your eye contact that be getting me aroused
When you show me your mind, it make me wanna show you mines
Reflecting my light, when it shines, just taking our time
Before the night's through, we could get physical too
I ain't trying to say I don't wanna fuck..cause I do
But for me, boo, making love is just as much mental
I like to know what I'm getting into

[Hook]
It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation

[Verse 2]
African princess, tell me your interests
Wait, let me guess, boo: you probably like poetry
Here's a little something I jotted down in case I spotted you around
So let me take this opportunity
Would you share a moment with me, over herbal tea?
Take a walk verbally, make a bond certainly?
Cause in my hand I bet your hand fit perfectly
And it's like we floating out in space when you flirting with me
C'mon, a little foreplay don't hurt
Imagine my chest under this shirt, your ass under your skirt
It's like walking the hot sands and finding an oasis
Opposites attract: that's the basis
Our sex is the wind that separates the Yin from the Yang
The balance that means complete change, our aim
Is to touch you in a delicate spot
And once we get it started, I ain't trying to stop

[Hook]
It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation
Mind sex

[Outro]
She smiles; I smile
She walks - no - she glides softly by me, changing night into day
She opens her mouth to speak
And so sounds ring in my head
She speaks, and I want to dance to her rhythm
She moves ever so gently, increasing my desires
As I place my arms around her waist
Hold and squeeze unto me
I want to melt into her body, and discover the base of her warmth
Her beautiful black body that no human mind could ever conceive
She's love, she's truth
She's real, as real as the stars that shine in the heavens
As real as the sun that bathes her body
As real as the moon that glows and the birds that sing and the rose
That blossoms in Spring - for she is that rose
And not just any rose, but a black rose
Black rose stands tall and stronger than any other plant
A black rose, that stands as Creator
Of nations of black roses
That never loses her petals, and blossoms all year round
Black rose, sweet rose, thornless rose, eternal rose
Please look my way
Please look my way
Please look my way
Black rose
