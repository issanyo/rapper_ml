[Verse 1: stic.man]
Nigga, the red is for the blood in my arm.  The black is for
The gun in my palm and the green is for the traum
That grows natural like locks on Africans
Holding the smoke from the herb in my abdomen
Camouflage fatigues and dashikis, somewhere
In between N.W.A. and P.E
I'm black like Steve Biko, raised in the ghetto
By the people.  Fuck the police (“Fuck the Police”)—you know how we do

[Verse 2: M1]
Ayyo, my life is like Roots: it's a true story
It's too gory for them televised fables on cable
I'm a runaway slave watching the North Star.  Shackles on
My forearm, running with a gun in my palm
I'm a African.  Never was a African-American
Blacker than black, I take it back to my origin
Same skin hated by the Klansmen.  Big nose
And lips, big hips and butts dancing—what!

[Hook 1: dead prez]
I'm a African.  I'm a African.  Uh (“Louder”)
And I know what's happening
I'm a African.  I'm a African.  Uh (“Louder”)
And I know what's happening
You a African?  You a African? (“Louder”)
Do you know what's happening?
I'm a African.  I'm a African.  Uh (“Louder”)
And I know what's happening

[Hook 2: M1 and Samples with Scratches by Mista Sinista]
It's plain to see you can't change me
‘Cause I'm People Army for life
It's plain to see you can't change me
‘Cause I'm People Army for life
It's plain to see you can't change me
‘Cause I'm People Army for life (“Louder”)
It's plain to see you can't change me
‘Cause I'm People Army for life (Where you from, fool?)

[Verse 3: M1]
No, I wasn't born in Ghana, but Africa is my momma
And I did not end up here from bad karma
Or for B-Ball, selling mad crack, or rapping
Peter Tosh tried to tell us what happened.  He was saying
If you black, then you African.  So they had to kill him
And make him a villain ‘cause he was teaching the children
I feel him.  Then, was trying to drop us a real gem
That's why we bucking holes in the ceiling when we hearing

[Hook 1: dead prez]
I'm a African.  I'm a African.  Uh (“Louder”)
And I know what's happening
I'm a African.  I'm a African.  Uh (“Louder”)
And I know what's happening
You a African?  You a African? (“Louder”)
Do you know what's happening?
I'm a African.  I'm a African.  Uh (“Louder”)
And I know what's happening

[Hook 3: M1] (x2)
A-F-R-I-C-A
Puerto Rico, Haiti, and J.A
New York and Cali, F-L-A
Yo, it ain't 'bout where you stay.  It's ‘bout the motherland

[Verse 4: stic.man]
This that tank top, flip flop, knotty dreadlock
Fuck-a-cop hip hop make your head bop
Bounce to this socialist movement
My environment made me the nigga I am
Uncle Sam came and got me and the rest my fam
Tried to infiltrate and murder off the best of my clan.  I'm not
American, punk, Democrat or Republican
Remember that most of the cats we know be hustling
My momma worked all her life and still struggling
I’ll blame it on the government and say it on the radio
(What?) And if you don't already know
All these Uncle Tom, ass-kissing niggas got to go
