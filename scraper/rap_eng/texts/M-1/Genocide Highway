I’m from peace avenue, stretch boulevard, murder row
Where bullets carve stories of all untold
Straight of the fear freeway, a change in the side highway
Exit where 187 homicide hill, where I stay
Where you can die today
Kids play summer, potential killer on the other side of town
I know some niggas that live in pity place
In the middle of nickel play city
In the greediest state
Their religion is criticism, sorry’s a word never heard
Money’s made from every bird
So many people that can see your pain
Living next door to jealousy and dead dreams
It always rains

[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting on 4 leaf clover, yeah, yeah
But I see the odds are clearly falling, dreams are fade away, yeah
Try pressing on a start that’s over, oh yeah, yeah
But the sky is drawn and leaves are frozen
Life is cold and grey yeah

40 first, guy broke, mo chanel, mother destiny, orange aile, 183, double d
Seminary, flatbush, discane, fulton street, 55, lane street, cross lake
I’m from a freshen avenue, my corner’s the murder capital
Prison city America 666
My building is built with thick brick, broken family district
Where every Friday night around 2 am shit get thick
Peace ripped up like bisquit
Promethezene maple syrup, and the child lullabies the lyrics
That don’t stop get it
Keep bopping the drama, don’t be stopping
Cause the heart of the problem is economic from the projects of suburbia
You can’t escape it, the home invasion will murder ya
Not brothers with bandanas in a convertibles
But men in black suits with badges that ran federal
Wanted dead or alive homie, they way ahead of you

[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting on 4 leaf clover, yeah, yeah
But I see the odds are clearly falling, dreams are fade away, yeah
Try pressing on a start that’s over, oh yeah, yeah
But the sky is drawn and leaves are frozen
Life is cold and grey yeah
