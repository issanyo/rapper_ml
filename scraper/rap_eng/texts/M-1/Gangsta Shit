Soul...Assassins!

[Verse 1: Bun B]
One for the clip
Two for the trigger guard
Three for the sights
I'm super-tight - this nigga's hard
Certified gangsta, ain't no pretendin'
Bitch I'm bad to the bone
And tough to the tendon
Catch me bending your corner
Coming through on the fly
With my head down low
And my steel up high
Trust me boy, you don't wanna go toe-to-toe with the ratchet
Cause what that motherfucker send - you gon' hate if you catch it
You got stripes? Fuck that!
I send them hoes right off your lapels
On my motherfucking own, like Patti Labelle
So you can run and tell that, like Martin Lawrence on sherm
Cause I'm looking for your ass in broad day like Big Worm
It's the king of the trill, I sit on the throne
So you best keep it real, cause I will shit on you holmes
This that gangsta shit, that know it you hear it
Soul Assassin shit that kill a nigga's spirit

[Hook]
This that gangsta shit!
This that gangsta shit!
This that gangsta shit!
This that gangsta shit!
This that gangsta shit!
This that gangsta shit!
This that gangsta shit!
This that gangsta shit!

[Verse 2: M-1]
M-1, I'm seeing double in my third eye
My four-fifth will stick men quick
You win our you die
Six feet ago you was a hard one
Then you met my squadron
Every man around me is my guard, son
??
Stumble in the same circle
Death can't hurt you, it's a curfew
And fuck Gotti? son, everybody got they gun
And you better get one before they off ya like Hoffa
I'm ??? M-1 this is how you clean your gun
Be prepared when the situation comes
Step one: Eject the clip and all the slugs from the chamber
Point it toward the ground to keep you people outta danger
Niggas with revolvers must be willing to clean the cylinder
Cause if the gun jams then it's who killing who?
Huey Newton told us where to get the power from
You want it?
You better get it from the barrel of a gun

[Hook]
