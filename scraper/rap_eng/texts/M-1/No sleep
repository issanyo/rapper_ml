Liberate me till the slow death drains my lungs of all the blood. Watch me sip the poison black heart beats like a drum. My grave makes your brain go-numb

A dozen black roses wait so patiently. For death to take them away from me but in the ground I still cannot sleep. Your in your room dreaming wishing you where me. But it would be to be me cause

(I can't sleep)

I'm feeling numb- in this season if warmth and disorder.  Dumb- when I'm bleeding and care.  Run- at the end of this tunnel we've dug our whole way here. Done- with a season to spare

(I can't sleep)

Come so quick. I can't sleep so I better slit my wrists or kick that bitch. You laugh at my misery. So I stay awake at night. My life's in the crosshairs when I got there my nightmares so real. Now you know how I feel when

(I can't sleep)

Listen up you can here my last breath seep out my lungs. Or is that the drums. It must be the drugs keeping me up. Keeping me up. When

(I can't sleep)

I lay awake in this coffin coughing blood like I'm leaning back waiting for paper from these raps to pay you back. Then I attack back at the devil. To wake me back up.

(I can't sleep)

Bet I'll remember that

(I can't sleep)

It's matt M1 for short you can call me that. But in thiese raps it's Peter parkour with a bag of grass. Take a hit of that. Fall on your ass. Eyes open brain dead.. But I..I..I.. I don't remember that

(I can't sleep)

... Or dream... My kin is making fun of me. What's wrong with me? Need room to breath? Not like I can dream. Or even need the medasin. To stay sane. My brain said the only way to sleep is having you lying next to me....!
