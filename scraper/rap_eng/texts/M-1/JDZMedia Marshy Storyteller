Yo, JDZMedia Storyteller
All tight M1 on the productions, jake on the camera
All tight fresh mids on the garms
R.I.P depz R.I.P little ben crayz, Ya listenin'? Yo!
Looking at the times i've had i've realised my life is mad
People piss me off i do my best not to try react
Fuck all a dem, i don't need 'em it's my finest fact
Got bare love for my mum i've never been beside my dad
That's why when i'm stressed i get more than 'slightly mad'
I try relax, cuz it's the key i need my life on track
If i see any of my fam stressed out it drives me mad
If you ain't' one of my main brothers don't come by me fam
Cuz man move fake behind your back and yeah i've seen it
It's real when i say 'trust no one' cuz i mean it
There's people who will say 'fuck that, i don't believe it'
But real recognise real fam cuz it'sthe deepest
Even girl can move fake
So watch who your chattin to
If you don't listen and it fucks up i'm gonna laugh at you
Got no anger in my voice
That don't mean my attidude
Wanna hit the top, so that root is what i have to choose
When i'm throwing energy drinks the only time you'll catch a boost
I'll be at the booth recording tunes while ? wrap a zoot
Cuz i'm high in music
It's my life i do this
And when it come's to bars and flows i'm way more than an average yout
The people that think different they must lie
I hold it up with balance don't need stabilizers like a push bike
When it comes to backing up the talk it's just hype
I look everywhere with R.I.P depz man and it don't look right
Shit's fucked up, yeah it's awfully peak
But you've gotta keep strong i saw it, as a teen...
Cuz quitin ain't gonna work
Like my doggy Eyez said
'it's important to believe*
When i heard depz man died i thought it was a dream wish i could turn back time, it's a story on the beat
They still keep secrets
Yet they're still talking in their sleep
Been on my face for months but face brought me on my feet
I didn't wish it but i wish i had a million wishes
I wish depz man was still here, spittin his lyrics
I wish little Ben was here too, sippin the spirits
When i think about them two i'm thinkin for minutes
Minutes turn into hours by the time that I've finished
I wish that if my mom needed anythin i could give it
I wish everyone would listen when i'm spittin these lyrics
I wish to keep on going and not stop till the finish
But i wish i wasn't wishing
I wish everything was different
I wish we would... we had to live in
I wish everythin' could start again from the beginning
I wish i had a wish with the penny and the stream's missin'
And i wish that i could find it
But that 1 wish is hiding
I wish for all the good things but it's all in good timing
I wish haters would admit my music's suprising
I wish i never had to wish that the world wasn't violent
So fuck the government
They're only listening to what's clear
I'm just really focusing on thinkin' how i got here
There's people out there, wishin' they were not here
But me? i live life to the max i'm sippin' on Courvoisier
Wishin' that i was near to where i wanna be
Wish i could break through in music and make a lot of P
So my family are nice, that's all i'm thinkin' of honestly
'family first is a saying'? that's the way it's gotta be!
Cuz the snakes in the grass try hate it's a fact
I was thinkin that it's just because a place and the past
Two face, they won't think twice to put a blade in ya back
Just waitin' for it, like a feen who's waiting for crack
Beggin' for your fame, it's making me laugh
I can't tell if you were there first like a race on a track
If ya makin' a stack
Then i'm takin' the cash
Like a balif I'm back
For the waiges and tax
