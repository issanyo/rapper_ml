[Intro, throughout: Pete Seeger]
Which side are you on
Which side are you on, boy?

[Verse 1: G1]
See before I draw the line, I gotta welcome you close
To all the folks who knew Obama sold the people a hoax
Gave the money to suckas while our community's still poor
Withdrew the troops, but started another war
Colonized and terrorized and created an oil crisis
So they could make a killin' on food and gas prices
Prisons is filling, they tryna lock up the future
Militarize borders and control of computers
While the stupid bumping music that ain't healthy for the shawties
Povertize the schools and policeman in the hallways
Can't be dormant, I've awoken, rise up, be ready
Brought the family with us and we hold the machete

[Verse 2: M-1]
Ridin' the fence, ridin' the fence
Too many people be ridin' the fence
Yeah you say you're ready for war but are you convinced - I'm not convinced
If you're a writer, freedom fighter, crime exciter, then let's do this
We can make one big united middle finger to the U.S
Gimme the bravest and the truest, fuck the hippest and the coolest
We're gonna spark the revolution, and cross it off our to-do list
Put your foot down if you look down on this criminal system
Put your book down, and get shook down like my niggas in prison
Don't be condemning and condoning they actions in one sentence
Now keep in mind, you decide
Is you a patriot or a menace to society
To riot or sit by quietly
But don't pull out your flag and try to say you gon' ride with me
You flip-flopping like hip-hopping, I don't get locked in that trick box
Get got like Big and Pac, shit's got to stop
I am the people not the pig, I repeat after Fred
So please blow my brains out if I ever forgive

[Verse 3: stic.man]
I'm with the independent thinkers, I'm down with the movers and the shakers
And the ex-henny drinkers, the non-smokers
The health advocates, the non-voters
The young bloods in the hood trainin' like soldiers
I'm on the side with the hood gardens
With the little child who don't color inside the margins
I don't ride the fence, I cultivate my strength
'Cause if it ain't about power, it don't make sense
An OG told me choose your battles wisely
In the struggle don't forget about your children or your wifey
If you don't see me on the podium everyday preachin' it
I hope my every action is teaching it
Revolution is a process, not a speech or a panel
Don't bite off more than you can handle

[Pre-Verse: RodStarz]
Chi City, Palastina, Venezuela
To South Bronx baby!

[Verse 4: RodStarz]
Ay I still rock hard like slingshots in Palestina
[Spanish:] Con todos los estudiantes por educación gratuita
[With all the students for free education]
I'm with workers uprising and the right to unionize
We ain't crossed the border so you better legalize
I'm with Penã la Bronx, I’m still with Victor Toro
‘Cause gentrification is pollutin' my borough
Decolonize the block, make your neighborhood better
I ain't down with the rich, I'm more Richie Perez
Don't talk to grand juries or cooperate with feds
I'm with students, doctors, janitors, teachers
We need living wages but they don't believe us
Manida, Baretto, Spofford, Hunts Point
My point, my hood, I love, we join
Forces
Forming RDAC-BX
Taking over buildings Rebel Diaz for the children

[Verse 5: Rakaa Iriscience]
Politics the sickness, streets express symptoms
Caught with a quickness, big business pimps 'em
Scholars play the simpleton, fools play with wisdom
Who will stand and fight back, who will play the victim?
Trials and tribulations, here's your generations
Stolen history and outsourced innovation
Southern tower fell, tribes are at war
The battled story not represented in the score
The game's fixed, most of the faces and names switched
Credit stolen for all art, science, religion, language
Technology, philosophy, and the strangest
They paid in Haitian for the knowledge of the ancients
Power in words, actions, pick a side
One sickness, one cure, one love, one blood, one war

[Outro, sampled: Pete Seeger]
Which side are you on?
Which side are you on, boy?
Which side are you on?

Come all of you good workers
Good news to you I'll tell
Of how the good ol' union
Has come in here to dwell
