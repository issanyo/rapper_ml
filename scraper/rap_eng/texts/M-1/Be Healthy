It's all love

[Verse 1: stic.man]
I don't eat no meat, no dairy, no sweets
Only ripe vegetables, fresh fruit and whole wheat
I'm from the old school, my household smell like soul food, bro
Curried falafel, barbecued tofu
No fish though, no candy bars, no cigarettes
Only ganja and fresh-squeezed juice from oranges
Exercising daily to stay healthy
And I rarely drink water out the tap, cause it's filthy

[M1]
Lentil soup is mental fruit
And ginger root is good for the yout'
Fresh veg-e-table with dem ital stew
Sweet yam fries with the green calalloo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods
Cause you don't wanna lose vitamins and miner-ules
And that's the jewel
Life brings life, it's valuable
So I eat what comes from the ground, it's natural
Let your food be your medicine (uh huh)
No Excederin (uh uh)
Strictly herb, generate in the sun, cause I got melanin
And drink water, eight glasses a day
'Cause that's what they say

[Hook: stic.man]
They say you are what you eat, so I strive to be healthy
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy
Cause true wealth comes from good health, and wise ways
We got to start taking better care of ourselves

They say you are what you eat, so I strive to be healthy
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy
Cause true wealth comes from good health, and wise ways
We got to start taking better care of ourselves, be
Healthy y'all

Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold the fuck up, yo
We'll take this little intermission, listen what the
Fuck we gotta say, y'know?
Word is bond son, niggas been livin foul for too long, knowamsayin?
Smokin bogeys, fuckin drinkin all types of shit
