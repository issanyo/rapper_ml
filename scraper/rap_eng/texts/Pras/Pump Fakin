(Intro)
I don't give a f*** about no police damn
I don't give a f*** about no police now
Run it yeah wave wave run it yeah yeah we gon run it

(Verse 1: Pras)
Only where they play blow
Mr Miyagi on that pay bro
Got that bloom bloom off of groupon
Christ that doubler a few times
My hey she eating mango
Hit that whip like he the jungle
Had to whip that s*** a few times
Spending stuff at Houston
These crackers in the way bro
Plottin' on my peso
Talking to the playclo
Tried an advance to get my lingo
Lock and load only rock with proper h**'s
Love it when she popular then you top and ride slow
Acting like they know me on the way tho
She never predicted on the pray home

(Hook)
N****'s out here Pump Fakin'
Say they gettin' money but they Pump Fakin'
Respect a n**** paper chasin'
Say you got the shottas but you Pump Fakin'
These lames out here Pump Fakin'
I can highly hear it but they Pump Fakin'
Respect a n**** paper chasin'
Say you're ballin' but why you Pump Fakin'

(Bridge: Pras)
Check out my portfolio x3
Moments of silence for the rodeo

(Verse 2: Young M.A.)
Could these herkin in them black Chevy's with the windows tinted
Creepin' like we don't know who winnin'
Peekin' tryna catch a lil n**** slippin'
Feenin' that throw a lil n**** in the fences
Theres no freedom the black Hue vs the blue demons and you can't hustle the hood hotter than Phoenix and
I know carryin' a gun is illegal but I don't carry to kill I just don't trust people I carry for my protection them haters in my reflection i'm paranoid can't afford to loose without investin'
What I look like trusting a f***ing cop you don't have to commit a crime they kill you cause your complextion
This ain't a message this real life a wise man once said "If you can kill once you can kill twice"
Pump Fakin' a** n****'s in my Insta comments
They don't know i'm from the same town as Mr. Wallace
Where they be wildin' the only option is violence dude
That ain't a threat that's a promise dude
They show love when i'm drivin' through
Told my old b**** that i'm slidin' through
So we can get higher than the pilot dude
So forget about issues, troubles and problems
We live like no tomorrow
Just to cover our sorrows
Runnin' from our reality
Keep my pass in the back of me
Focusing on my future
Try to stop me i'll shoot ya

(Hook)
N****'s out here Pump Fakin'
Say they gettin' money but they Pump Fakin'
Respect a n**** paper chasin'
Say you got the shottas but you Pump Fakin'
These lames out here Pump Fakin'
I can highly hear it but they Pump Fakin'
Respect a n**** paper chasin'
Say you're ballin' but why you Pump Fakin'
