Talking:
"Uh. I mean I'm just sittin' right here
Checking out this young lady right here
Baby you hot
I mean you sexy. Oh my god!
Let me ask you one question
Where you from anyway?"

Singing:
She's Miss California, hottest thing in west L.A
House down by the water. Sails her yacht across the bay
Drives a Maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene
Loves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name

She's a rich girl, from the top of the food chain
Love and material things, kinda lonely
'Til I met her at the Grammys, 10mil on a diamond ring
She invites me to spend a day on the jet skis
At first it didn't mean a thing
Then she told me I'm the one that she's searched for
It was hard to believe

She's Miss California, hottest thing in west L.A
House down by the water. Sails her yacht across the bay
Drives a Maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene
Loves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name

In a couple a days she had me a bracelet made
From Harry Winston's place
Went horseback up to the mountaintop
Showing me the land she's got
Well it's all right, but something else is on your mind
Looking past all that shines, now the tears are running through
All those things are nice, but it's not why I'm here
I will wipe away your tears simply by just loving you

She's Miss California, hottest thing in west L.A
House down by the water. Sails her yacht across the bay
Drives a Maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene
Loves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name

She's Miss California, hottest thing in west L.A
House down by the water. Sails her yacht across the bay
Drives a Maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene
Loves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name

Talking:
"And there you have it. I mean she just love the way I do my bling-bling
From the ghetto to Beverly Hills baby!
Now I want everybody on the dance floor to just shake it
Man, I want you to get down, cause we hot tonight baby!
We on fire!
Now tell these cats where you from."

We can't take it no more. Now tell them cats where you from baby
C'mon let 'em know."
