[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Look into the rhyme, rum to the rip-ripple
Single, but at times I come in triple
Blaow, blaow, put the heater to your head
Now you're dead, Wyclef don't give a *ooh* if you're dead
Raaaaah, raaaah, let me attack just like the black cat
You in the wrong neighborhood, check the map
Hooo, you've got to go for backup, to do what you gotta do
So you'll be back with France CU
Traitor in your crew is mafo heat, put the poison in your tea
And kill the toad, but I'll be back with the centipede
I'm on some new technique, drunken bamboo
Awoo hoo a hoo, I'm taking all crews what
Competition, stimulation for the rap man
Losers check your tooters while I'm suckin' on your girl hooters
Don't play macho while you got the gun 'cause if you got to reload

[Chorus]
It’s time to settle the score!

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Wyclef the multi-talented, average heads can't handle it
I'll bring it to you live, only if you want it
Me and my guitar go back like the days of the R MC's
(C'mon check out my melody)
The W-Y-C-L-E-F, Wyclef
Through any contest, I'm victorious
Still keep it real, if you will and manifest
Through your skills, not by how many shells you peel

[Verse 3: Praz]
I'ma bring down the ruckus, play the nutcracker
Rough-neck rednecks make me no bother
Time after time, ask Cyndi Lauper
Boss, you don't want to fuck with my partners
Motion, commotion, what's your proposal
Uphold two-fold, the crew is disposal
Like utensil, false idental
I autograph my lyrics with a number 2 pencil

[Chorus]
It’s time to settle the score!

[Verse 4: Lauryn Hill]
I'm the L, won't you pull it
Straight to the head with the speed of a bullet
Cuttin' niggas off at the meeky-freeky gullet
Lyrical sedative, keep niggas medative
Head rushers I give to creative kids and fiends
Dreams of euphoria, aurora, to another galaxy
Phallic, see, be this microphone, but get lifted
Lyrically I'm gifted, burn on in without the roach clip (it)
Henders, mind-bender, pleasure sender
So frequently your nerve endings belong to me
Wrongfully you put me down not receiving the full capacity of my smoke
Wack niggas choke from the fumes that I emote
Or emit shit, see even I feel the mahogany L
Natural hallucinogen, turning boys to men again
With estrogen dreams, release blues, yellows and greens
From Brownsville to Queens

[Chorus]
It’s time to settle the score!

[Verse 5: Diamond D (Lauryn Hill)]
I creep like a thief, no doubt the man's swift
I'm more magnificent than Lee Van Cleef
You stand stiff and got the nerve to let your man riff
(We know where to run) And start flakin' like dandruff
C'mon son my steelo's tight
'Cause by far I'm the best producer on the mic
Born to write, analytical conceptions
With precision and leave lyrical incisions (bing!)
