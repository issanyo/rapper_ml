[Intro: Kelis]
Tell me, what'cha wanna do?
Pras, Clipse and Kelis, too
This is for the blues, this for the rats
Everybody bang your head

[Hook: Pras+Kelis]
Ey yo
Shake shake it, your head just shake it
Go down low to the floor but don't break it
Pras, Clipse, Kelis we abuse it
This is it, count down, now lose it

[Part 1: Pras]
Yeah, now I'm sit back and wonder how could they ever
Foolish cats playing smart, not being clever
How ever, Pras is the final frontier, yeah
Tell you what [?] pressure I'm appear
Time to separate the Pro's from the Con's
The gold from the bronze
The platinum oh his arm, nigga
Be gone while like to win
When i come with the twin
Be like "where've you been?"
A pistol when I'm dismiss you
Clearest Crystal, the target is on, yeah
I'm like flying missle
Blowing everything inside, fuck a fair fight
Tonight's the night and I'm a - a dynamite
Ghetto Superstar Star starring me
The flyest refugee you'll ever see, word
Fuck what you heard, 'cause the world is me
And if you're ready to rock, come sing with me

[Hook: Pras+Kelis] x2
Ey yo
Shake shake it, your head just shake it
Go down low to the floor but don't break it
Pras, Clipse, Kelis we abuse it
This is it, count down, now lose it

[Part 2: Clipse]
What'cha see here, about a few grand in each ear
But don't take this look for sweet as heat here
(I got) 45 reasons for y'all to keep clear
Choose nine your last day will be taken like leap year
Could never get demeanor be my first impression
See I got your girl's attention and you second guessin
(Follow your) Instintict, boy, I've got to teach you a lesson
Choose wrong, so long, baby count your blessings
Two chicks at the footer, my bad
So they can lick from both sides
And tongue each other when they reach my head
When I finally get heavy like I'm spitting out [leg?]
Get me to thinking, maybe some things are better off unsaid
Now here's a little riddle for all of y'all to swallow
What hold more ice?
My "Halo" or my "Movado"
Ghetto Superstar, living like we hit the lotto
Drive-By and a tear drop by a full throttle

[Hook Kelis] x 2
Tell me, what'cha wanna do?
Pras, Clipse and Kelis, too
This is for the blues, this for the rats
Everybody bang your head

[Hook: Pras+Kelis] x2
Ey yo
Shake shake it, your head just shake it
Go down low to the floor but don't break it
Pras, Clipse, Kelis we abuse it
This is it, count down, now lose it

[Part 3: Clipse]
What'cha wanna do? Hey yo, what'cha wanna do?
Often I'm crossing, I leave that up to you
'Cause I'm against what they up against, they ain't got a clue
Ain't nothin' for me to cop back and send 'em over too
Hot ones out the window while I'm ridin' shot-gun
How you call yourself a thug, but can't wait 'til the cops come
'Cause I'm show 'em something, that I know they won't out run
With odds that 10 to 1 I let you guess that outcome

[Pras]
Ey yo I love superthugin
And the back of the club lovin' it
If it moves then we're fuckin' it
I'm wonderin' why niggas hate us
Some us hatred
1999 and your shape outdated
Make your move partner do the Do-si-do
Then watch me showcase these flows a black expo
Don't move a muscle, bust a Hollywood Shuffle
Pillowcase to your head, got to get my hustle on

[Hook: Pras+Kelis] x2
Ey yo
Shake shake it, your head just shake it
Go down low to the floor but don't break it
Pras, Clipse, Kelis we abuse it
This is it, count down, now lose it

[Kelis] x 2
Tell me, what'cha wanna do?
Pras, Clipse and Kelis, too
This is for the blues, this for the rats
Everybody bang your head
