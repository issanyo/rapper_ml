[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Have you ever worn the mask, yeah
One-two one-two

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill & Both]
M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask upon the face just to make the next day
Feds be hawking me, jokers be stalking me
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity
My posse in the Brooklyn wear the mask
My crew in the Jersey wear the mask
Stick up kids doing boogie woogie wear the mask
Yeah everybody wear the mask but how long will it last

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
I used to work at Burger King. A king taking orders
Punching my clock. Now I'm wanted by the manager
Souping me up saying "You're a good worker,"
"How would you like a quarter raise, move up the register"
"Large in charge, but cha gotta be my spy
Come back and tell me who's baggin my fries
Getting high on company time."
Hell no sirree, wrong M.C
Why should I be a spy, when you spying me
And you see whatcha thought ya saw but never seen
Ya missed ya last move, Checkmate! Crown me King
Pulled my 22 pistol whipped him in his face
Hired now I'm fired, sold bud now I'm wired
Eyes pitch red but da beat bop my head
Hit the streets for relief, I bumped into the Feds
I got kidnapped they took me to D.C
Had me working underground building missiles for World War III

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill & Both]
M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask 'pon me face just to make the next day
Brothers be gaming, Ladies be claiming
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity
My posse Uptown wear the mask
My crew in the Queens wear the mask
Stick up kids with the Tommy Hill wear the mask
Yeah everybody wear the mask but how long will it last

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
I thought he was the wonder, and I was stunned by his lips
Taking sips of an Amaretto sour with a twist
Shook my hips to the bass line, this joker grabbed my waistline
Putting pressure on my spine trying to get L-Boog to wind
I backed up off him then caught him with five finger to his face
I had to put him in his place
This kids invading my space
But then I recognized the smile, but I couldn't place the style
So many fronts in his mouth, I thought he was the Golden Child
Then it hit me that's Tariq from off the street around my Grams
I haven't seen him since fifteen, when he got booked for doing scams
I tried to walk away but he wouldn't let me leave
He ran up quick behind me asking, "Yo what happened to my nigga Steve?"
Steve was like this kid I went with back in Grammar School
I chuckled knucklehead I seen him yesterday he's cool
He's busted, "so who you checking for now?"
Probably some intellectual
I kept the conversation straight and he kept trying to make it sexual
Then his old lady tried to play me waved her hands up in my face
Yo I told her check your man 'cause bitch you acting out of place

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill & Both]
M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask up on the face just to make the next day
Brothers be frontin', then they be runnin'
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity
My posse in the Bronx wear the mask
My crew on the Isle wear the mask
Stick up kids rolling in the Omni wear the mask
Yeah everybody wear the mask but how long will it last

[Verse 3: Praz]
3 A.M. in the morning on the Boulevard
I'm still at large engaged with my entourage
Me and Godfather and a 67 Dodge
I stepped out the note to post up my guard
Searching for my car that was stolen from Scotland Yard
My first instinct was to check the chop shop garage
As I rung the bell someone tapped me on my back
I turned around to look it was a rookie in a mask
He said, "I got a itchin' on my trigger
Don't move nigga I'm taking you for murder."
See cops got two faces like two laces on my Reeboks
My knees knock as I step back for a clearer shot
Well did you shoot him? Naw kid I didn't have the balls
That's when I realized I'm pumpin' too much Biggie Smalls

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill & Both]
M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask up on the face just to make the next day
Brothers be beefin', cops be thiefin'
Brothers be scheming, they should be teaming
Jokers be smoking, and staying broken
Bitches be teasing, there money skeezin'
Niggas be creeping, baby mothers be weeping
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity
My posse in the 80 wear the mask
My crew in Jamaica wear the mask
Stick up kids bumping Fu-gee-La wear the mask
Yeah everybody wear the mask but how long will it last
I said
M to the A to the S to the K
