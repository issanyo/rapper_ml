[Sample: Wyclef Jean]
Went from a dream to the young Supreme

[Verse: Kelly]
Hey, yeah
Searching for a destiny that's mine
There's another place, another time
Touching many hearts along the way, yeah
Hoping that I'll never have to say

[Refrain: LaTavia:]
Boy, I love you
But I gotta let you go

(Illusion)

[Chorus:]
Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again
Daze in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

[Verse: Beyonce]
Follow your emotions everywhere
Is there really magic in the air?
Never let your feeling get you down
Open up your eyes and look around

[Refrain: LaTavia:]
Boy, I love you
But I gotta let you go

(Illusion)

[Chorus:]
Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again
Daze in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

[Verse: Beyonce]
Can it be a picture in my mind?
Never sure exactly what I'll find
Only in my dreams, I'll turn you on
Here for just a moment then you're gone

[Refrain: LaTavia]
Boy, I love you
But, I gotta let you go

(Illusion)

[Chorus:]
Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again
Daze in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

[Pras]
Yeah, yo, yo, yo, hey, yo
I don't write love songs
Leave it up to Luther Vandross
How I choose to live
You don't wanna know the cost
I paid to be the boss
Hear it straight from the source
Fortune 500 is how I like to gloss
High side, Korneesh Style, joy ride
Blowin' candles in the wind like Princess Di
Get at me, mom, tell me how you really like it
Cuz we could fly high, I'll be your co-pilot

[Bridge/Verse: LaTavia and Pras:]
Hey, yo back to the girl with all the razzamatazz
(Hey, yo, I love you, shorty)
You talkin' all that jazz
Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go
I know you want me but you play me like the lott'o'
Use and abusin' so there won't be no friction
I gotta leave, I can't be in this illusion

It's just an illusion

[Chorus:]
Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again
Daze in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again


[Outro: Wyclef Jean]
Another one from Wyclef
Another one from Jerry "Wonder"
Another one from Dirty Cash
Dance, I say, dance, I say, ha ha
(Confusion!)
Refugee Camp
(Illusion, you get in)
Destiny Child
(Me again)
We out

[Chorus:]
Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

[Sample: Wyclef Jean]
Went from a dream to the young Supreme
Went from a dream to the young Supreme
