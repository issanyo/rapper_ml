(Ky-Mani: Chorus)
Oh no, oh no
Say, we gonna rock down through electric avenue
And then we'll take it higher (higher)
Say, we gonna rock down through the brooklyn avenues
And then we'll take it higher (higher)
Oh no, oh no

(Pras: Verse One)
Yeah, yo, slick like Rick James when I hit
Superfreak chicks, I don't miss (Yo I don't miss)
Mix wit yo nose, my flows make you sick
Two chicks for me, none for you like Twix
Play with niggas head like Clef's guitar picks
Went from bottom pits to makin hits and
Hollow tips and shootin lips (right)
Handle our business, make sure it sits
Ride throught the tunnels, fuck the guest lists
Light up your block with roman candlesticks
Known to blow shows with pyrotechnics
Rappin bout yo' whips while you cats in transits
Buyin shorty gifts with checks from wick
Your record sound like a demo that was not yet mixed (shit ain't even mixed yet)
Your whole style's broke and it should be fixed
Time's runnin out as my Rolex ticks
Don't get caught on the ave, it's too electric

(Ky-Mani: Chorus)

(Pras: Verse Two)
I dedicate this to my peeps who roam the streets
God bless they souls, may they rest in peace
There are those who finance and those who choose to lease
Whatever suits you better on the terms of your lease
Different strokes for different folks God
I refuse to going back to being broke Lord
He got struck wit lightnin, he got hit hard
Faces 20 to life maximum, his whole life is scarred
The preacher's son and I came off the Santa Maria
Ten cases of malt I caught the diarrhea
Load the ReFugees on the aircraft carrier
Some say Dirty Cash, we never heard of ya
(You don't know me? You don't know me?)

(Ky-Mani: Chorus)

(Pras: Verse Three)
(alright, alright)
Watch yo back, watch yo side, swimmin wit sharks
String you like a harp while they playin Mozart
No credentials, get nowhere like ozlo
Sent back to frisco, at the regal begal
Suave like Rico, on fire like pyro
Frantic like skitzo, rougher than Brillo
He caught the wrap like Donnie Brascoe

(Ky-Mani: Hook)
Out in the streets there is violence
Down in Brooklyn there is violence
Down there in Queens there is violence
And there's a lot of work to be done (Lord)
Down in the ghetto there's violence
Out in L.A. there is violence
In Miami there is violence
And there's a lot of work to be done (Lord)
Say, we gonna rock down through refugee avenue
And then we'll take it higher (higher)
Say, we gonna rock down through haiti avenue
And then we'll take it higher (higher)
(Refugee all stars, yeah, yeah)
