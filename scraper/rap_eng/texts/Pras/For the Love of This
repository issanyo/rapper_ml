(Pras)
Uh, yeah
Yo, yo, yo it's so amazin how I be blazin
From the four seasons to you at the days in
Where you lay at on the cages?
I comin with a cannon, two guns blazin, purple hazin
My shine can be appraised, my tongue radiate
Orchard violent rays, why you stower in the off broke and paid
Singin your heart out, oh happy days, I'm movin on up
Damn, I wish I had it made, ran on your parade
Make you exchange at the word trade
Dig son, your whole couldn't add up to my half
I'll count your funds yeah, like third grade math
Blast to your path every mornin I break flags
Dirty cash always find a way to get stash
From Italy to the deepest alley
Up to the highest mountains of the Himalayas
I put that on a stack of bibles so I stack a prayers
Yo democrat block, must get shot
Believe me not go ask Pac Prodock
Scream on the crew when you don't know how
Shiver liner got, rhymes in every single cloud, cause what

(Chorus: Pras)
For the love of this, I give my life a diss
And for the love of this, I send my last wish
For the sake of hip-hop, will you never stop?
You see I will do anything but I won't do that
(Sniff Coke) won't do that (slang dope) can't do that
(Get out the car) shouldn't do that (take off your rope) why do that?
(Feel the gun smoke bloaw!)
Do you hear me baby

(Pras)
Yo, I got no life to spare, no time to bear
No TL care, I'm single like a stair
I can feel it in the air comin everywhere
Twenty years from now, I'm gonna be a billionaire
Red for the on the island M-I sicky underwear
Leavin all the BS elsewhere, I swear
Black you out make you see the boat like Noah
There's nothin here for y'all, glasses like Coca-Cola
Mix-a-Mack make em see there's not enough buildings
Not ever since when I drop by these flash un a peepin
No reef thugin more caffeine than tryin
Spread the love yeah to all my beloved
High speed chasin, low pro pursue
Black shoes important, soldiers come Bay Root
So look to my troops and the stolen Coupes
Here's the gun don't talk about it, just get up and shoot (stop it)
Hold up son, let me set up the pace
I'm that cattle in the race on the Human Race
Don't call me Human, call me Lou-man
Like par, move your record company under ?You-Hah?
Family business FR to snitches
I'm down with M.O.B. yeah Money over Bitches

(Chorus: Pras)
For the love of this, I give my life a diss
And for the love of this, I send my last wish
For the sake of hip-hop, will you never stop?
You see I will do anything but I won't do that

(Pras)
For the love of this I'll paint myself green
Within myself in the Corrine, Pras Most Wanted
Last seen with Sister Morphine
Scuba Diving with the Navy Seals in the Yellow Submarine
Headed for, the Philippines, microphone fiend with are regain green
It burns when I eat tangerine, wash it down with a cup of Gasoline
Burn into flames, like your actress said Ilene
Supreme Dream Team, musical machine, money makin machine
Walk through the Desert butt-naked with a inch of canteen
Slappin it, rapper'll be like nah mean?
Got nothin but a piggy in a tree, to what I shoot and some washed out jeans
Headin for the stars word, word to God
Watchin every move placin all my cards
The game'll soon come like the aliens
Everybody runnin, sayin that's the one

(Chorus: Pras)
For the love of this, I give my life a diss
And for the love of this, I send my last wish
For the sake of hip-hop, will you never stop?
You see I will do anything but I won't do that
(I sell Crack) won't do that (peel on your back) can't do that
(Here comes the Gat) shouldn't do that (if you wanna lay flat) why do that?

(Pras)
Yo, come on, do you hear me baby (hear me baby)
Uh, uh, uh, Navy Seals y'all, Refugee Camp what, what
You better stop it, punk, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it HA!
98-99, yeah, yeah, (*Dirty said several times*) Cash haha
