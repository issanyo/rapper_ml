Go 'head and do it
Refugees, go 'head and do it (paper)
Go 'head and do it
Refugees, go 'head and do it (paper)
Go 'head and do it
Refugees, go 'head and do it (paper)
Go 'head and do it
Refugees, go 'head and do it (paper)
Go 'head and do it

[VERSE 1:]
Ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
That you've been trying to infiltrate my crew
It ain't no hiding from the Flava U
Don't get it confused, you ain't untouchable
(Go 'head and do it)
Now I've been trying to keep my cool like a queen
(Ooh, cool like a queen)
Bout to bring the Newark girl out of me
(Ooh, Newark outta me)

[Chorus]
Don't you know I heard you trying to take my...
While I shine, y'all live them fake lives
Don't you know I heard you trying to take my...
While I shine, y'all live them fake ass lives
All around me
(Haters try to play La, but
They know that they can't take her paper)

[VERSE 2:]
Everybody talking see
Spreading them lies about my friends and me
They say that we're tighter than friends supposed to get
That's because I haven't let you chill with me yet
You make it hard for a girl to roll
(Ooh, girl to roll)
But make it easy so my pockets stay swole
(ooh, pockets stay swole)

[Chorus]

[Pras]
That's right, yeah
Check it, check it, what
Check it, check it
Come on, come on
Yo, yo
Where my fellas at? Where my fellas at?
Where my ladies at? Where my ladies at?

[VERSE 3:]
As I look back on my life (check it)
To get where I am, I had to sacrifice
You slander my name in your magazine
This business gets hard trying to stay the queen
You're checking for me, you need to check yourself
(Ooh, check yourself)
And be someone, not someone else
(Ooh, someone else)

[Chorus]

(Flavor Unit, Refugee Camp All Stars)
Heard- Heard-
Heard you tryin' to take my (paper)
Heard- Heard-
Heard you tryin' to take my (paper)
(Why they wanna stick me for myâ€¦)
