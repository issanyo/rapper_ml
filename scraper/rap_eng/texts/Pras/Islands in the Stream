[Verse 1: Kenny Rogers]
Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on

[Verse 2: Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton]
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on

[Pre-Chorus: Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton]
Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah ha
From one love to another, ah ha

[Chorus: Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton]
Islands in the stream that is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha

[Verse 3: Dolly Parton]
I can't live without you if the love has gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

[Verse 4: Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton]
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

[Pre- Chorus: Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton]
No more will you cry, baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, ah ha
From one love to another, ah ha

[Chorus: Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton]
Islands in the stream that is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha

[Outro: Kenny Rogers]
Oh baby alright
[Incomprehensible] superstar that is what you are
Coming from afar reaching for stars
Fly away with me to another place
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
