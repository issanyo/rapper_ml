Uh, yeah, huh, yeah
Yo, yo, yo, I'll do a double dish cleaner
The funny ass cats remind me of a skinner
Now you listen up, now what, heat on spitter
A renegade with my blade watch you get cut up
Sucker ass punk, you used to get beat up
Type of dude that'll smoke your weed up and eat up
Hold up, surrender your squad, it's a stick up
Fifty-two pickup, you high school drop-out, gives you enough float
To succeed or get tighter, what up, your block, get up
Shut up, or put up I'ma bout to let up
Licky, licky here, two shots you gone lick up
Take her to the news under: You should've eased up
Wha' What Wha' you got me fed up, get up or shut the f up
You done f'ed up, 8 or 9 enough even if she has seven runner up
Like the fans, like your thumbs up, what up?
I make them bowl like Shopper Ranks
I'm the Captain of the Ship, make them cats walk the plank
What the f you think I'm point, point blank
Turn off my sound niggas, let... crank

(Chorus w/variations)
East Side where you at, where you at?
West Side throw it up, throw it up
North Side where you at, where you at?
South Side throw it up, throw it up

See, blaze me above the game with no limit
Niggas nowadays can slick and pull gimmicks
Cowber use roly well iced that been in it
Mines is loose rocks and the Beverly spin in it
Only place tin linid they cost a lot
When no money on the game you sure talk a lot
Never like a nigga car, you walk a lot
See I make cream a lot, while you niggas dream a lot
Can't you see it's all real, bras want to do me
Get it attached to me like I'm starrin in movies
Nigga Nor wanna do me, thing is I got none
Wanna be my main chick, chill I got one
If it's hot in a lady then I can cop some
Most players all fall, tightly tint
See me fly through the window cause it's lightly tint
But its strongly minute got a fall so cats frequent
Hate weed peepin, best cats seekin
Wanna kill me in the daytime, look it won't happen
You ain't a thug nigga this is some girls is rap, what
(Yeah you don't won't no problem)

(Chorus w/variations)
East Side where you at, where you at?
West Side throw it up, throw it up
North Side where you at, where you at?
South Side throw it up, throw it up

Yo my M-O is S-O-L-O... hello
Shake like Jello bionics and nice fellow
Long hair, pussy's and pussy head too
In a room with the doctor, how the hell I stop ya?
The Rolex topper long as ya coppin them yo
It means it's copper, don't need to stop ya
When I'm speakin opera, which y'all don't understand
That it's my channel Boo-Bionic mister man
Why y'all play Tennis we sway inventists
So our house can finish, wait a minute
Change the color of my whips, despite you bastards
Spit it green-cold on it, like you won the masters
Flow... faster, speed it up, heat it up why don't y'all just heat it up
Spit it on some feeder bust, slow it up, make the beat that we blow it up
Ya niggas ain't mine, better pray you throw it up

(Chorus w/variations)
East Side where you at, where you at?
West Side throw it up, throw it up
North Side where you at, where you at?
South Side throw it up, throw it up
Now...

(Pras)
Yo I keep my mind on my riches snitches get snitches
Cats on the low they all act like bitches
So what up, where you at with the nine-sin?
Feel my triples please circle the violence
Let me abolish this sh... like Nat Turner
Drop by Tom Warner, peace to my crooked cop killers
With the six shooter while fake niggas getting drunk off of wine coolers
Yo, uh...

Yo she big on the game it's broke I wanna fix it
Make hot... and get that down, we remix it
He speakin, here we go your beef is nice
I'm from the gutter mother... best you think twice
Now back to who's nice M-O-S-T-W-A-N-T-E-D
You niggas can't see me I'm glad that you turn
Poke that out of space shit, I bring you back to Earth, what

(Chorus w/ varaiations)
East Side where you at, where you at?
West Side throw it up, throw it up
North Side where you at, where you at?
South Side throw it up, throw it up
East Side where you at, where you at?
West Side throw it up, throw it up
North Side where you at, where you at?
South Side throw it up, throw it up

(*Wha, Wha, Wha... echoes*)
