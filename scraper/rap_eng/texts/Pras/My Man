[Verse 1: Anggun]
Boys like you can't stop playing with the toys
Girls like me won’t stop tryin' to change your world
If you wanna be my man
I will make you understand
If you wanna be my man, quit the games you’re playing

[Pre-Chorus: Anggun]
I’ve been watching you
Secretly lady, just like a hunter
I’ve been watching you
Looking for someone that you can conquer
I’ve been watching you being a player
If you wanna be my man
You have got to cease the chasing game

[Chorus: Anggun]
Won’t you drop your guns, arms in the air, baby?
Shake it up for once, so do you dare?
If you were my man, if you were my man
Won’t you drop your guns for me, for me?

[Verse 2: Anggun]
Girls like me will keep on falling for
Bad boys (bad boys) like you
Think you can be rocking my world
But if you wanna be my man
You could better understand
If you wanna be my man
Quit the games you’re playing

[Pre-Chorus: Anggun]
I’ve been watching you
Secretly lady, just like a hunter
I’ve been watching you
Looking for someone that you can conquer
I’ve been watching you being a player
If you wanna be my man
You have got to cease the chasing game

[Chorus: Anggun]
Won’t you drop your guns, arms in the air, baby?
Shake it up for once, so do you dare?
If you were my man, if you were my man
Won’t you drop your guns for me, for me?

[Bridge: Anggun]
Later to set me free (set me free)
Better to set you free (set you free)
Better trying maybe (trying maybe)
Don’t you know? You should know
(Hey, yo, princess)
If you wanna be my man (lemme talk to ya)

[Verse 3: Pras Michél]
Let me buy you a drink, better yet the bar
Listen I wanna be where you are
I know, don’t really know who you are
But we can love in the club, make love in the car
Go back to the club, make it pop in the club
Look. Stop. Come give me a hug
You may not really know who I am
But trust me, I’m gonna be your man
Now I’ma tell you, like the G told me
Catch. Lose everything around me
I see the ring, but it’s really no thing
Hold’em off you kill a doover less fame
Hold up. Watcha mean you got a man?
Who’s American, that’s me ain’t Japan
Creole over my pizza pan
You know, I know, I’m your number one fan

[Chorus: Anggun]
Won’t you drop your guns, arms in the air, baby?
Shake it up for once, so do you dare?
If you were my man, if you were my man
Won’t you drop your guns for me, for me?
Won’t you drop your guns, arms in the air, baby?
Shake it up for once, so do you dare?
If you were my man, if you were my man
Won’t you drop your guns for me, for me?
