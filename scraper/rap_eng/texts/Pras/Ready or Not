[Hook: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake, they break
When they meet their 400-pound mate
If I could rule the world, everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto of course, when giddyuping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
But, no, don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking 'bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pellet guns from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

[Hook: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress, if you don't smoke sess
Lest I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Goretex and sweats
I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty, like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're doo-doo
Voodoo; I can do what you do, easy
Believe me, fronting niggas give me heebie-jeebies
So while you're imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defecating on your microphone

[Hook: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
You can't run away
From these styles I got
Oh baby, hey baby
â€˜Cause I got a lot, oh yeah
And anywhere you go
My whole crew gonna know
Oh baby, hey baby
You can't hide from the block, oh no

[Verse 3: Pras with Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, refugees taking over
The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover, now they're under, pushing up flowers
Superfly, true lies, do or die
Toss me high, only puff lye with my crew from Lakay
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border, like I'm Cassius Clay (yes, sir)

[Hook: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me
