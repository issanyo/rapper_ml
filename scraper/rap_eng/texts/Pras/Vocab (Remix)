Why is everybody always picking on me?
I rocked a rhyme that's right on time
It fit my idiosyncrasy
It's hip to be the most eccentric product on the planet
So can it
I should've had some status when I planted
But when implanted
Ignorance plans to damage
And when imported in
Important soldier
That you're never sword-less in
Or you're fin
Mind from man
Keep cordless and cordially
Epic when orally
Now tell me, now, who want more of me?
The "K" is for the knack that I adapted just to kick
The "N' is just for nonchalant, don't knock before I rip
The "O" is for outlandish foes don't vanish when I spit
They fold or split in half
The "W's" for whiff on this
Lyrics for "L"
The "E" is for excel
"D", dominant eye, depicts visions
Whoever I inflict, visions they tell "G"
And it all brings it back to "E"
"KLS" for Hip Hop
Long as you be loving me
I'll be rocking thee
Eternally like Leon Ware
And burning your soul internally
Externally
Yo, I can see the glare
Others know, so know, it's fair
And I tug at heart strings
And hardly be tardy and pulling arteries
No cause in starting me
