[Intro]
A dedication to all the refugees worldwide
One time, say, say, say

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Brooklyn
Observing the crookedness
As it mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had, good friends we've lost along the way
In this great future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say
And to my peeps who passed away

[Hook]
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, say, say, say
Hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry, say, say, say

[Verse 2]
I remember when we used to rock
In a project yard in Jersey
And little Georgie would make the firelight
As stolen cars passed through the night
And then we'd hit the corner store for Roots, paper, and brew
My drink's my only remedy for pain of losing family
But while I'm gone Shorty

[Bridge]
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Fugees come to the dance tonight
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
The gun man's in the house tonight
But everything is gonna be alright
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah

[Hook]
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, say, say, say
Hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry, say, say, say

[Verse 3]
I remember when we used to sit
In a government yard in Trenchtown
Observing the hypocrites
As they mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had, oh, good friends we've lost along the way, hey
In this great future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Hook]
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, say, say, say
Hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry, say, say, say

[Outro]
And to my peeps who passed away
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
