[Intro: Offset & 21 Savage]
Zaytoven
Connected just like what? (21, real shit, nigga, uh)
Connected just like hotspots (woo, pocket, nigga, what the fuck)
21, woo, ya
21, uh, ya, yaa
21, 21, 21

[Chorus: Offset & 21 Savage]
Connected just like hotspots (connected, uh, hotspot, oh)
Don't come on my block, it's a hot spot (hah, hah, hah, hah)
One way in an' one way out (one stop, one stop, one stop, one stop)
You say that you trappin', we see what you 'bout (you say that you trappin', you know you ain't trappin')
Connected like hotspots (connected)
Connected like hotspots (woo, woo)
Connected like hotspots (uh, 21)
Connected like hotspots (21, 21, 21)
Burn a nigga, that's a hotspot (pop, pop)
Standing on bricks like its hopscotch (bricks, 21, uh)
The block is hot, I got connections everywhere like hotspots (21, 21, oh)

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I'm cookin' up dope in the kitchen (skrrt, skrrt)
I leave the crumbs for the pigeons (say, what?)
These niggas be praying and wishin' (say, what?)
But me, I get up and go get it (what?)
I walk around with the thirty (the thirty)
I'm pourin' up fours and I'm thirsty (I'm what?)
You know that these bitches be thirsty (they what?)
Burglar bar doors when I'm servin' (21)
I really came from the streets (21)
I used to run from police (fuck twelve)
We not gon' play with the beef (uh-uh)
We pull up with sticks and we eat (grah-grah)
I done came a long way (long way)
My momma, she told me to pray (to pray)
I used to sleep with them roaches (the roaches)
Now, I'm playin' with the K (21)

[Chorus: Offset]
Connected just like hotspots (connected, uh, hotspot, oh)
Don't come on my block, it's a hot spot (hah, hah, hah, hah)
One way in an' one way out (one stop, one stop, one stop, one stop)
You say that you trappin', we see what you 'bout (you say that you trappin', you know you ain't trappin')
Connected like hotspots (connected)
Connected like hotspots (woo, woo)
Connected like hotspots (uh, whoa)
Connected like hotspots (connected)
Burn a nigga, that's a hotspot (pop, pop)
Standing on bricks like its hopscotch (bricks, huh, fuck)
The block is hot, I got connections everywhere like hotspots (huh, oh)

[Verse 2: Offset]
I was on the block before the rap (before the rap)
Servin' niggas in my culdesac (serve)
Mini-14 with the shoulder strap (shoulder strap)
'Case a pussy nigga wanna act (pop, pop, pop)
I used to be broke, but ain't goin' back (no)
Now we makin' movies, cinematic (movie)
I focus on money, don't worry 'bout bitches (focus)
I'm in love with money, we so attached (movie)
Round up my money, more haters start comin' (hey)
I got some millions an' I'm still humble (yeah)
Locked up in cells and I couldn't do shit (cells)
And I swear to God, man, I was feelin' lonely (lonely)
Even though that I got millions, I still keep the forty
It gotta stay on me (pop, pop, pop)
I don't give a fuck if you run your mouth (fuck)
I swear I'm goin' out like I'm Tony (Montana)

[Chorus: Offset]
Connected just like hotspots (connected, uh, hotspot, oh)
Don't come on my block, it's a hot spot (hah, hah, hah, hah)
One way in an' one way out (one stop, one stop, one stop, one stop)
You say that you trappin', we see what you 'bout (you say that you trappin', you know you ain't trappin')
Connected like hotspots (connected)
Connected like hotspots (woo, woo)
Connected like hotspots (uh, whoa)
Connected like hotspots (connected)
Burn a nigga, that's a hotspot (pop, pop)
Standing on bricks like its hopscotch (bricks fuck)
The block is hot, I got connections everywhere like hotspots (oh)
