Broke bitch broke folks
I don't like no broke folks
Broke bitch broke nails
I don't like no broke nails
Broke bitch broke bitch
I don't like no broke bitch
Broke bitch broke fish
I don't like no broke bitch (repeat)

(Verse 1: Yamine)
I don't like no broke bitch
I don't like no broke snitch
I don't fuck with rachet hoes
Unlike they need the dick
Well hell naw I don't need that bitch
If you ain't got no money
Then you need an assist
You needed cash for the night
So I gave you a tip
I got Xtra large
No little shrimp
Well once you opened yo shit
It smelled like fish
You got a lake, no a river
No a ocean
With some swimmers
Yo shit is polluted in that mug
That's why yo P blood is liquor
My nose is fucking burning
Cuz that shit tasted like ciger
You a broke bitch
Cuz you can't afford that nigga
I was embarrased so I pulled the trigger
You a nasty hoe
With no shows
That's why yo budget with point kill em
I don't care about your feelings
All I care about is the feeler
I got a new bitch
And her shit kicks even quicker
