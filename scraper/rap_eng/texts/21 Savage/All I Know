(Intro: Yamine)
Yamine and Young Trap. Man support my homie Young Trap this is a Zone 3 Atlanta Connection. Let’s Get it!

(Hook: Young Trap)
All I know is niggas gone hate
All I know is fuck you pay me
All I know is money make the world go
All I know is that the money won’t change me (repeat)
All I know is that the money won’t change me (repeat4x)

(Verse 1: Yamine)
Money rain, let them rain
I don’t give a damn cuz the money won’t change
I have the cash, cuz of the game
I am the man and I will stay the same
Yamine is the boss and yo bitch give me brain
I’ve been waiting for my cash, now here comes the bang
Me and Young Trap will run up through yo gang
Fuck them goons nigga
I’ll do the same thang
If money funny
Then you I’ll dump you in a ditch
If money dirty
Then I’m filthy rich
I’m a godfather you sons of a bitch
I talk all the shit, still bumping Three 6
My Uncle rock a G6, I driven it one day
And left it into pieces
Young Trap, man all these niggas gon hate us
Because you in the game and you getting paper

(Hook: Young Trap)
All I know is niggas gone hate
All I know is fuck you pay me
All I know is money make the world go
All I know is that the money won’t change me (repeat)
All I know is that the money won’t change me (repeat4x)
