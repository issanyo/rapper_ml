[Intro: Sosamann]
I just caused a spill, damn

[Hook: Sosamann]
I can tell that you ain't real, you are not in the field
I was kicking doors for real, all I did was whip
I was out there running wild, packin' thirty clips
Now I'm walkin' in with style, all I do is drip
I just caused a spill, damn, I just caused a spill
I just caused a spill, damn, I just caused a spill
On my Sauce Savage shit, all I do is drill
I just knocked a new bitch, I just want the grip

[Verse 1: Sosamann]
Damn, I just caused a spill
And all my diamonds real
I split the grip on them
See you and me are not the same like a synonym
I came up serving cocaine for some dividends
But now I just stack it and stack it
I don't want the bitch, she a faggot
And I get to the money, it's my habit
See i play with them racks like Serena
And the bitch say I'm fresh like a cleaner
In the game while you up in the bleachers
I'm a dealer, I serve you some features
Rocking Maison Margielas for sneakers
Rocking Maison Margielas for style too
I'ma get it and get it and count the loot
I'ma hit 'em, I aim at the fountain blues
So give me a room and go see the view, damn
And now had live on them couches
I came up from dealing amounts
I came up from dealing them squares
Don't fuck with the weak, I can tell that you frail

[Hook: Sosamann]
I can tell that you ain't real, you are not in the field
I was kicking doors for real, all I did was whip
I was out there running wild, packin' thirty clips
Now I'm walkin' in with style, all I do is drip
I just caused a spill, damn, I just caused a spill
I just caused a spill, damn, I just caused a spill
On my Sauce Savage shit, all I do is drill
I just knocked a new bitch, I just want the grip

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Murder gang I drip
Bitch I keep a trip
Pull that off the hip
He just copped a clip
He just copped a drum
That’s a whole hundred
Bitch my bankroll
None’ but old hundreds
I pull out and nut in her back
Bitch I’m a pimp, I’m a mack
You play with this shit you get whacked
I slime ‘em and sell this shit back
Young Savage took Jill from Jack
Young Savage, I keep me a strap
I put the cat in the hat
I put the top in the lap
Bitch you gon’ get it and go
Bitch I’m gon’ hit it and go
I hit the whip in the bowl
I put my wrist in the bowl
I put my dick in your ho
She kissin’ it, lickin’ it, bro
I put that bitch in Dior
Murder gang, nigga woah

[Hook: Sosamann]
I can tell that you ain't real, you are not in the field
I was kicking doors for real, all I did was whip
I was out there running wild, packin' thirty clips
Now I'm walkin' in with style, all I do is drip
I just caused a spill, damn, I just caused a spill
I just caused a spill, damn, I just caused a spill
On my Sauce Savage shit, all I do is drill
I just knocked a new bitch, I just want the grip

[Verse 3: Sancho Saucy]
I got twenty thousand in my grill
Oh my sauce, I just made a spill
Niggas mad ‘cause I’m really pimping
Niggas mad ‘cause I’m really dripping
Niggas mad ‘cause I’m knocking bitches
Had to thank god for the way I’m living
Cause I could be in the penitentiary
But a nigga still here dripping
I got the sauce from myself
I got the proof on the shelf
Sauce Twinz been drippin’ on ‘em
Big Sancho been pimpin’ on ‘em
And my neck full of gold medals
Me and Leeno down in Splashlanta
And we playin’ with the heavy metal
Reach for my chain, I’ma [?]

[Hook: Sosamann]
I can tell that you ain't real, you are not in the field
I was kicking doors for real, all I did was whip
I was out there running wild, packin' thirty clips
Now I'm walkin' in with style, all I do is drip
I just caused a spill, damn, I just caused a spill
I just caused a spill, damn, I just caused a spill
On my Sauce Savage shit, all I do is drill
I just knocked a new bitch, I just want the grip
