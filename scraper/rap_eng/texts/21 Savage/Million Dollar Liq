[Intro: 21 Savage]
I met a new Migo, He said he got kilos
I met a new Migo, He said he got kilos

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I met a new Migo, He said he got kilos
He asked me how much can I move, and i told him a few
I'm 21 Savage, I rob all my plugs, and He don't have a clue
He told me they touch down in a week or two, so be ready to move
A Week or two passed, He pulled up with bricks
I'm Looking like shit, I'm Finna be rich
I Took a brick, took a 9 out and turned it back into a brick
And it's still coming back, Nigga i got the cleanest dope in the six
I got clean dope down [?] Migo he just changed my life
If he pull up with a hunnit i might have to take his life
ManMan Caught him at the back door he was looking like
"Papi why you wanna cross me i thought you was on my side"
I told you pussy nigga young savage with the bullshit
Running off with niggas work, Bitch I'm with the bullshit
I'm a back stabber but im really not with the cool shit, I think the fuck shit that im on should be a movement
