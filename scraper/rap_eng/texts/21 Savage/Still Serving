[Chorus: 21 Savage]
AK with the scope, nigga and it's real dirty (21)
It don't got Glock on the bottom, nigga it ain't no real 30 (facts)
Dranking all this Act', it got my vision real blurry (21)
My uncle just turned 49 and he still serving
Got a bitch hooked on dick (21) put a shoestring on my TEC (yeah)
I ain't never been no bitch (21) and I stand up when I piss (on God)
VVS's all on my wrist, my nigga, white stones just to match my chain (my chain)
Bought a AP rose gold, AP yellow gold, nigga and I bought one plain

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Go against the gang and it cost him (cost him)
Made a diss song and I offed him (I offed him)
I take niggas off, I don't take losses (on God)
Bitch I pop my collar like the bosses (21 21)
Nigga, pop your collar like the bosses (bosses)
Nigga, flip your dollars like the bosses (bosses)
Runoff on your partner like the bosses (21 21)
And I'm sending hits like the bosses (on God nigga)
Savage keep that Glock on him, yeah (yeah)
Savage think 'bout dropping M's, yeah (yeah)
Nigga talking 'bout robbing him, well (well)
Them .223s gon' make his face swell (21 21)

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
AK with the scope, nigga and it's real dirty (21)
It don't got Glock on the bottom, it ain't no real 30 (facts)
Dranking all this Act', it got my vision real blurry (21)
My uncle just turned 49 and he still serving (on God)
Got a bitch hooked on dick (21) put a shoestring on my TEC (yeah)
I ain't never been no bitch (21) and I stand up when I piss (on God)
VVS's all on my wrist, my nigga, white stones just to match my chain (my chain)
Bought a AP rose gold, AP yellow gold, nigga and I bought one plain

[Verse 2: Offset]
Offset!
I got a lot of codeine habits (lean)
I was robbin' at the store when I ain't have it (give it up)
Still depend on the stick, it's automatic (brrrr)
Rich bitch, and yeah my bitch got a Patek
Reaching for my chain, cut his hand off when I order
Skeleton, 5980 cost a quarter (bust)
Borders, I got Mexicans to transport it (plugs)
Couple hundred thousand stashed in the dirt soil (stash)
Still in the kitchen, off cooking up pollo (still)
55 years old asking for a photo, ugh
Diamonds on the throat, I'm a GOAT (ugh)
Margiela coat in the snow ho, ho
Pop the Adderall like a Tylenol
Playin’ with the racks, volleyball matching haunted house (racks)
Bitch, I'm from the Nawf and I've did it all (nawf)
I was 'bout to knock 'em out but I put it off (spared)
Stones in my mouth cost me 25 (stones)
All these wedding bands on like I got 20 wives (whoo)
I'ma fuck around and let the semi ride (hey)
I'ma chop the block up like a samurai (hey)
Nigga you done told about a hundred lies (cap)
Nigga cappin', you ain't never did no homicide (cap)
‘Bout that action, see me flashing like the paparazz' (pah pah)
And we deeper than the fucking Nazis (hey)

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
AK with the scope, nigga and it's real dirty (21)
It don't got Glock on the bottom, it ain't no real 30
Dranking all this Ac, and it got my vision real blurry (21)
My uncle just turned 49 and he still serving
Got a bitch hooked on dick (21) put a shoestring on my TEC (yeah)
I ain't never been no bitch (21) and I stand up when I piss (on God)
VVS's all on my wrist, my nigga, white stones just to match my chain (my chain)
Bought a AP rose gold, AP yellow gold, nigga and I bought one plain

[Outro: 21 Savage]

I got raw clean, yeah, make your nose lean, yeah
I serve raw clean, yeah, I drink raw lean, yeah
I got raw clean, yeah, make your nose lean, yeah
