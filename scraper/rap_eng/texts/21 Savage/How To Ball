I walked to Ferragamo bought the whole wall
Real street nigga all I go is hard
When I'm in the building better cuff your broad
Chevy and Lil Harold they'll pull your card
Rolex on my wrist they call me forty large
All a nigga do is get money
Put em on the stick we gunning
Spent a hundred thousand that's nothing
Say you get money you fronting
Popping out since I done it
That canneroll fucking up your stomach
And we chilling with a killer we thugging
Nigga make the wrong move he blooded
