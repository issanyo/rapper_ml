[Verse - 21 HÃ¸pe]

Lil Dick, I mean Lil Hoe
Nah, Joe, for real, dissing me
I ain't dipping out, I ain't missing
I'm alive, killing the flow, waiting for you to pop some pills
Why you slipping, pussy boy
Never forgiving, whipping the beat
I got the heat, wishing you were better
Sticking, pissing Mez, woah, woah
Where the fuck is Mez, cause we winning
Here is a dead letter to your life
I know you ain't hiding, tryna enter the game
Off flow, while I grow, I'm glowing, woah, woah
Lame bitch, never could pleasure a bitch
Tryna measure, shit never work out
Is it true
Luis just support your music, cause your dad is his teacher
Why not, put a beater as a feature
You're just a dreamer of nature
I'm just the reaper in your mind, while you have a seizure
You need a breather, cause I'm the leader
You're just a believer, I still kill you while having a fever
Like I'm an Bieber fan, I'm the achiever
Fuck off, you diva
Creeper looking ass, cheap ass acting deep
Run you over with a jeep, broken legs
Asleep, bloody throat
Tryna ride a bike pegs, but you fall on your head like threads
You better hike

[Verse - Savon]

Lil Joe
You a hoe
Nigga you are unknown
Told me to pull so you could shoot me with your 30
Told your fat ass ex that she looks like a rollie polly
So I put a rollie on my wrist
You just got the clout from a rapper in the K
I swear to god all these niggas you claim they are lame
You called my boy out talking about how he just want the fame
But last time I checked we let it rain on your name
I wanna know who the fuck puts lil in their name
Most rappers with lil in, their name is lame
Might as well call you Stuart Little fucking dork
Crawl back in your hole, and wish it was gone
Savon hopped on the beat
Hope is on it too
It's not my fault that you wanted to lose
Put this shit on repeat cause we won
No more sneak peek
Wrapped my hands around your song
Chocked the fuck out of it
So you could use vocals harder
Lil bitch
Lil bitch
Joe is a lil bitch
