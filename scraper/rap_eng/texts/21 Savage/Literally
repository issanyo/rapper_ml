[Intro]
Pull up on em
Pull up on em

[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco]

Pull up on my enemies, they tried to get rid of me
I pull up a foreign that's literally
I pull up a foreign that's literally
I want a Honda that's literally
[?]
And I wanna get it in, I'm trapping and ballin' winnin'
[?]
21 he a savage tryna make it through the madness
Get it in but you can't

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
(21, 21, 21)
Run that shit up I run off on my plug
Murder gang savage these niggas some thugs
Sex, money, and I love drugs
Drop my baby mama off pick your hoe up
Ex partner nigga beat a bitch throat up
Gang-banging give a fuck what you throw up
[Johnny Cinco:] Stomp his ass out, stomp his ass out
Pull up on 'em tell them choppers is out
Make a diss song I put a chop in your mouth
I'm with Cinco nigga, fuck is a drought?
Send it through the mail I run it right out
King Slaughter baby I'm a boss
Trap money got me in a loft
Kidnap your bitch [?] knock a friend off
Fame make you cut your friends off
Fuck that I'm with the gang now
Walked in the building niggas went to cuffing bitches and they taking chains off

[Hook:]

Pull up on my enemies, they tried to get rid of me

Tryna step that shit up to a camera now
Cup full of lean I can't go without

Everywhere I go I ride with 'em
Pull up in the streets I survive with 'em
Fuck on a bitch I'm 'gon vibe with her
