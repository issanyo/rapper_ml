[Verse 1]
Hot box with a paper tag on it
Your baby brother used to be my crash dummy
Don't call my phone if it ain't 'bout cash money
I don't wanna talk if it ain't 'bout cash money
I got a lot of shooters 'round me and they hungry
He sold a zip and now he acting like he Tony
I be chasing after money like I'm homeless
I had to leave that bitch alone cause she was bogus
Put a 100 on your head
Now a nigga dead
You niggas know that Young Savage will paint the city red
I don't want to do no song with these niggas 'cause they scared
Draco on the seat I keep that Draco on the seat
Molly, percs and weed you know these bitches like to eat
Slaughter gang, we slaughter hoes cause half these bitches freaks
All the shit I've been through man it change a young G
That's why I keep that hundred round drum around me
That's why I keep a lot of fucking guns around me
If you ain't with the gang you better not come around me
All that motherfucking leechin', ain't no bummin' round' me
You like that pillow talk but niggas shoot for fun around me

[Chorus]
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
They robbin' round my way
Shootin' around my way
Ain't nothing sweet, you better keep a gun around my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
They robbin' round my way
Shootin' around my way
Ain't nothing sweet you better keep a gun around my way
Round my way
Round my way
Round my way
