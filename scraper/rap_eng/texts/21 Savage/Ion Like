Shawty Fresh on the track

[Chorus: Trouble]
Ion even like goin' where I can't take that pistol
You gettin' this cash this cash gon bring you issues
You move too fast I spazz I take that wit you
Ion fuck wit crab we laughin' at you niggas
Ion fuck wit rats pray that you die bout that
Ion even like goin' where I can't take that pistol
You gettin' this cash this cash gon bring you issues
You move too fast I spazz I take that wit you
Ion fuck wit crab we laughin' at you niggas
Ion fuck wit rats pray that you die bout that

[Verse 1: Trouble]
You distance yourself from the fuck niggas, they say you a fuck nigga
Since you been runnin' it up nigga, you stay in the cut nigga
Me I just stay like the same Troub, I'm still like the same thug
You might have all of the same folk, it just ain't the same love
Niggas be beefin' wit me about hoes, in they imagination
Ain't overlookin' nann situation, ain't overlookin' nann situation
Came in the parking lot, airing station and you wanna face it I tell you ain't basic
You wanna fade me why the hesitation, get you some paper lil petty stop hatin'

[Chorus: Trouble]
Ion even like goin' where I can't take that pistol
You gettin' this cash this cash gon bring you issues
You move too fast I spazz I take that wit you
Ion fuck wit crab we laughin' at you niggas
Ion fuck wit rats pray that you die bout that
Ion even like goin' where I can't take that pistol
You gettin' this cash this cash gon bring you issues
You move too fast I spazz I take that wit you
Ion fuck wit crab we laughin' at you niggas
Ion fuck wit rats pray that you die bout that

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Ion even like goin' nowhere without that pistol
Nigga fuck that, young savage I'ma pull up on ya
Roll the window down and then bust ya
Nigga rappin' bout it you a boo gangsta, nigga shot at ya you ain't shoot back
How the hell you get ya chain snatched, niggas payin' for they chain back
Slaughter gang bitch I claim that, Glenwood where I banged at
Where a nigga got his stain at, where I learnt how to aim at
Pull up and shot, we gutta yeah, make sure you close to yeah
Them crab niggas actin' like hoes yeah we cut em my friends turn to foes

[Chorus: Trouble]
Ion even like goin' where I can't take that pistol
You gettin' this cash this cash gon bring you issues
You move too fast I spazz I take that wit you
Ion fuck wit crab we laughin' at you niggas
Ion fuck wit rats pray that you die bout that
Ion even like goin' where I can't take that pistol
You gettin' this cash this cash gon bring you issues
You move too fast I spazz I take that wit you
Ion fuck wit crab we laughin' at you niggas
Ion fuck wit rats pray that you die bout that
