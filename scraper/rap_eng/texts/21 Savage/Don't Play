[Verse 2: No Plug]
It's a manslaughter, make your girl swallow
Ice on my collar, bet a thousand dollars
Killed a nigga and his partner, shot his bitch with the chopper
Savage said off 'em, so you know I had to off 'em
Broke ass nigga buried in the wood coffin
Break down the bread, boy you know I'm bird off
Shooting birds at the nigga, Stone Cold Steve Austin
Zone 6, 9th Ward bitch, you know we triple crossing
Diamonds on me flawless, cold like Boston
There better be cops, VVS's moon walking
Watch a cool forty, tryna take the arm off it
Get shot in the face, try to take the charm off it

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Red bandana, yeah yeah
On my extendo, yeah yeah
Got that yopper, yeah yeah
Out the window, yeah yeah, 21
We don't play no games, no Nintendo (21, 21)
Yeah, we don't play no  games, no Nintendo (21, 21)
Zone 6 nigga don't play (woah), 9th Ward nigga don't play (woah)
Zone 6 nigga don't play (woah), 9th Ward nigga don't play (21)
Zone 6 nigga don't play (woah), 9th Ward nigga don't play (woah)
Zone 6 nigga don't play (woah), 9th Ward nigga don't play (woah)
