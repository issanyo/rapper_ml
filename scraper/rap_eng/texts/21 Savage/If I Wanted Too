[Chorus: Yin Yang]
I take a trip if I wanted to
Smoke out that zip if I wanted to
I fuck your bitch if I wanted to
Buy a new whip if I wanted to
Boy you can't do what you want to do
I bought my mama some Jimmy Choo's
Trappin' out the buggy, missing roof
I'm getting money, don't need no proof

[Verse 1: Yin Yang]
Caviar frames on my face
Calamari on my plate
19 and got my own place
Broke niggas, they a disgrace
Smoking heat, I got a fever
Catching balls, I'm a receiver
Denny got the case of Act in the freezer
Mix it with the Xans, we might have a seizure
If you a bad bitch it was nice to meet ya
Fuck the football game, I was hitting dope by the bleachers
I was in Buckhead, going to the cleaners
But I was never doing any cleaning
Every thing I did, it was a reason
I was number one like I was Ariza
Hawks' stadium, pour another four during the season
I get the cheese, no pizza
Love the addicts cause I need 'em
Black and white just like a zebra
Feds pull up on me, I got amnesia
Got my dope from my man in Indonesia
I ain't with the games like my name was Lisa
And my bitch bad, she a diva
And I know just how to treat her

[Bridge: Yin Yang]
I was really fucking getting it
Just take a look at my percentages
My OG is my representative
Don't fuck with niggas cause they sensitive
I was really fucking getting it
Just take a look at my percentages
My OG is my representative
Don't fuck with niggas cause they sensitive

[Chorus: Yin Yang]
I take a trip if I wanted to
Smoke out that zip if I wanted to
I fuck your bitch if I wanted to
Buy a new whip if I wanted to
Boy you can't do what you want to do
I bought my mama some Jimmy Choo's
Trappin' out the buggy, missing roof
I'm getting money, don't need no proof
I take a trip if I wanted to
Smoke out that zip if I wanted to
I fuck your bitch if I wanted to
Buy a new whip if I wanted to
Boy you can't do what you want to do
I bought my mama some Jimmy Choo's
Trappin' out the buggy, missing roof
I'm getting money, don't need no proof

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I get that money and spend it
I'm in a Rari, it's tinted
I fucked his bitch now he trippin'
Bitch man ain't in it, I'm in it
I got a way with the women
I got a way with the hoes
I spend my money on money
You spend you money on clothes
I broke my arm in the bowl
And I get 20 a show
I get my diamonds from Italy
I spent a check on that Rolls
I spent the check on her purse
Then I went bought me a vert
I'm scrapin' the bowl then I skurt
I'm scrapin' the bowl then I skurt
I'm ridin' 'round with a stick
Make this muthfucka fishtail
I get surgical with the pump
Nigga call me Denzel, Training Day
I just might hop on the plane today
My jewelry on me, but I'm plain today
Money on me, it might rain today
Give a fuck 'bout what these haters say, bitch I'm gon' get it
Got a friend with a friend, bitches come wit it
Nut all on her titties, bitches gettin' freaky
These niggas wanna be me, bitch I ball like bebe

[Chorus: Yin Yang]
I take a trip if I wanted to
Smoke out that zip if I wanted to
I fuck your bitch if I wanted to
Buy a new whip if I wanted to
Boy you can't do what you want to do
I bought my mama some Jimmy Choo's
Trappin' out the buggy, missing roof
I'm getting money, don't need no proof
I take a trip if I wanted to
Smoke out that zip if I wanted to
I fuck your bitch if I wanted to
Buy a new whip if I wanted to
Boy you can't do what you want to do
I bought my mama some Jimmy Choo's
Trappin' out the buggy, missing roof
I'm getting money, don't need no proof
