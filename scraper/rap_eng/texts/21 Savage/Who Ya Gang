[Verse 1: Hardo & 21 Savage]
Doin’ something right, you ain’t doing nothing right
Whip the rice, end your life
Slaughter Gang came with a knife
Snatch your chain and your wife
Damn, I hop this bitch don’t jam
Chopper got range bitch
You know what I claim bitch
Trap Illi Gang bitch
Stay in your lane bitch
21 Gang bitch
You know what I claim bitch
We ain’t the same bitch
Your man a lame bitch
Look at my chain bitch
I make it rain bitch
Fuck what your gang with
We on the same shit
Niggas always pillow talk with bitches
They on some lame shit
Heard he went and got his Glock extended
We got the same clips
Me and Hardo
In the jewelry store
Spent a hundred, woah
Spent two hundred, woah
Put that forty on his nose
Look how that motherfucker blow
I’m whipping OGs on the stove
I just whipped a nine out the bowl

[Hook: Hardo]

Same nigga, nothing changed
Same nigga, bigger chain
Same nigga, bigger name
Who ya gang, who ya gang?

[Verse 2: Hardo & 21 Savage]
Getting money with the set
Counting hundreds on the steps
Got your bitch inside the Lex
All these diamonds, got her pressed
She looked at my ring, wooh
She want fuck my whole crew
I do what I want to
You do what you can do
I be running up a check
Five bands, I’m at the rex
Trap Illi, fuck the rest
21 inside the ‘Vette
Look how that motherfucker go
‘bout to dip out on that road
She snorting that shit off the floor
Got your ho playing in snow

[Hook: Hardo]

[Verse 3: Jimmy Wopo]
Now I just spent some bands on that chopper thing
Call up through the grass, think I’m John Wayne
Muney Lane, we finessed him out his Johnny Dang
Snatched his man, juuged the nigga out his pinky ring
And bitch you know ooh Wopo bought a hoop
Alley-oop, my young niggas out the roof
Who ya crew? Who ya gang? Who is you?
Skip to my lou, you can’t hang if you won’t shoot
What happen in the booth stays in the booth
We know that’s not true
I stack like a Jew
That MAC hit your tummy and back up your boo
Ooh, I’m biting the perc and it’s stuck on my tooth
Her date linking up so we drive through a crew

[Hook: Hardo]
