[Chorus: Reese]
Got me a check on 'em, ballin' like chemo
Got wrists like a free throw
Fuck up the scene on 'em, fuck up the scene on 'em
Fuck up the scene on 'em, I'ma fuck up the scene on 'em
Got me a check on 'em, ballin' like chemo
Got wrists like a free throw
Fuck up the scene on 'em, fuck up the scene on 'em
Fuck up the scene on 'em, I'ma fuck up the scene on 'em

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
(Get it)
You know how this shit goin' so hard man we fuck up the scene, easy work
Nigga I ball everyday, and you only inside of the club on the first
Throwin' money all over the floor, 'cause my niggas came from the third
Life is a bitch, but I know I can fuck if she flirt
Just somethin' 'bout her, know that she down and she tuckin' my work
Tuggin' my shirt, I might kill that shit it's in the back of the horde
Been all 'round the world but I feel like the king when I'm back in my city
Livin' a dream homie, pockets so heavy, I'm leanin' like shit

[Chorus: Reese]
Got me a check on 'em, ballin' like chemo
Got wrists like a free throw
Fuck up the scene on 'em, fuck up the scene on 'em
Fuck up the scene on 'em, I'ma fuck up the scene on 'em
Got me a check on 'em, ballin' like chemo
Got wrists like a free throw
Fuck up the scene on 'em, fuck up the scene on 'em
Fuck up the scene on 'em, I'ma fuck up the scene on 'em

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I fuck up the scene
Crack in my pants and I'm drinkin' on lean
Bought a .40 and it came with a bean
Twenty thousand, I can't hold up my jeans
Fuck up the scene, fuck up the scene
I pull up in a brand new foreign machine
I call up the sixties, they gon' get it crackin'
Bitch I'm Slaughter gang, you know that I'm brackin'
Twenty thousand bags, you know that I'm taxin'
Real stoner, so I'm smokin' on wax
Chopper on me, make it sing like the Braxtons
We move quit, nigga call us assassins
I fucked it up, I spent a pen on my jacket
Niggas snitchin', I put ten on a Aston
Street nigga, fell in love with the cashin'
I don't need a stylist, I'm havin' fashion
Twenty-one

[Chorus: Reese]
Got me a check on 'em, ballin' like chemo
Got wrists like a free throw
Fuck up the scene on 'em, fuck up the scene on 'em
Fuck up the scene on 'em, I'ma fuck up the scene on 'em
Got me a check on 'em, ballin' like chemo
Got wrists like a free throw
Fuck up the scene on 'em, fuck up the scene on 'em
Fuck up the scene on 'em, I'ma fuck up the scene on 'em

[Verse 3: Bricc Baby]
Balmon, the jeans on 'em
Let's count up some cheese on 'em
I'm dabbin a freeze on 'em
I'm dabbin a freeze on 'em
I run up a check, you servin' them bricks
I fly the bitch like a bud
I'm loaded the bricks on the jet
They takin' off from LAX
Ch, Check out the gold on my neck
I'm feelin' I got it and flex
These bitches don't know what to expect
I'm keepin' my foot on their neck
I pull up in rari and flex
Kill him if he own me check
I am in that carbon the chance of a nigga turn out I'm not like the rest

[Chorus: Reese]
Got me a check on 'em, ballin' like chemo
Got wrists like a free throw
Fuck up the scene on 'em, fuck up the scene on 'em
Fuck up the scene on 'em, I'ma fuck up the scene on 'em
Got me a check on 'em, ballin' like chemo
Got wrists like a free throw
Fuck up the scene on 'em, fuck up the scene on 'em
Fuck up the scene on 'em, I'ma fuck up the scene on 'em
