[Hook]
I feel like Tony, I'm a bad guy
Skinny clippers, I'm a bad guy
All I hang around is bad guys
All I hang around is bad guys
You play with the shit you get whacked
I pull up and shoot at your neck
My clip longer than my leg
I don't wan' fuck, I want head
Who done there got be back started?
Who done there got be back started?
Who done there got be back started?
Who done there got be back started?
Ya'll all done got me back started
Ya'll all done got me back started
Ya'll all done got me back started
Ya'll all done got me back started

[Verse]
Slaughter King, bitch
Diamonds in my ring, bitch
I don't give a fuck about a bitch
All I wanna do is hit licks
Fuck a trapper, I take shit
Fuck your bitch, I take your bitch
I'm tryna go me buy a Wraith and shit
The choppa make you do the Matrix, bitch
No Miami, I got heat
Got the choppa on the seat
We don't play 'round with that beef
If he gon' play, we gon' eat
Yeah nigga, free the Wolf
Niggas scared, niggas shook
Slaughter Gang got the hook
Fold a nigga like a book
We run through these bitches
We count up these digits
I don't got no feelings
My coupe got no ceiling
Drug dealin' and killin'
But I prefer killin'
I'm not with the talkin'
Young Savage a villain

[Hook]
I feel like Tony, I'm a bad guy

I pull up and shoot at your neck
My clip longer than my leg
I don't wan' fuck, I want head
Who done there got be back started?
Who done there got be back started?
Who done there got be back started?
Who done there got be back started?
Ya'll all done got me back started
Ya'll all done got me back started
Ya'll all done got me back started
Ya'll all done got me back started
