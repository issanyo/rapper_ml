[Intro]
21, 21
21, 21
Good head make a nigga toes curl (hol' up)
Southside
An' I'm still flexin' on my old girl (hol' up)
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
I'm in the studio and I got hoes there (21, 21)

[Chorus]
Hol' up, bitch, you on some guap
Hol' up, bitch, I need some top
Hol' up, bitch, I'm in a drop
Hol' up, bitch, I'm in a drop
Hol' up, bitch, I'm rich as fuck
Hol' up, bitch, I'm 'bout my books
Hol' up, bitch, I see his [?]
Hol' up, bitch, them diamonds, yup
Hol' up, bitch, watch where you step
Hol' up, bitch, I got that chop'
Waitin' on me to wife you, ah
Bitch, you bet' not hold your breath
Hol' up, bitch, you bet' not tell
If I fuck you, bitch, you bet' not tell
If I fuck you, bitch, you lucky

[Verse]
I need a thick, brown-skin bitch like Buffy
I need a bad bitch to suck me up
I need a bad bitch to lick it up
What, what?
Need a gnat, gnat
Took the rubber off an' skeeted on her butt, butt
Fucked her best friend, she like, "So what?"
I'm a real skreet nigga, you a whole duck
I'm in 9th Ward, nigga, doin' doughnuts
I'm in paradise, nigga, doin' doughnuts
PDE and Slaughter Gang and, nigga, we goin' nuts
All that pillow-talkin', nigga, get you ripped up

[Chorus]
Hol' up, bitch, you on some guap
Hol' up, bitch, I need some top
Hol' up, bitch, I'm in a drop
Hol' up, bitch, I'm in a drop
Hol' up, bitch, I'm rich as fuck
Hol' up, bitch, I'm 'bout my books
Hol' up, bitch, I see his [?]
Hol' up, bitch, them diamonds, yup
Hol' up, bitch, watch where you step
Hol' up, bitch, I got that chop'
Waitin' on me to wife you, ah
Bitch, you bet' not hold your breath
Hol' up, bitch, you bet' not tell
If I fuck you, bitch, you bet' not tell
