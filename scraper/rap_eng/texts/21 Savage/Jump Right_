Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: 21 Savage & Young Thug]
No stressin'
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga!
No stressin'
I troop, lil' nigga I bless you

[Verse: 21 Savage]
[?] tellin' in a [?], it's not a Tesla
Somebody called 911, he need a stretcher
4,5 with the dick on it (21, 21)
Sweet move I put my bitch on it  (21, 21)
Travel a lot around the world with that stick on me
Got a nigga life savers on my [?] (Bling blaow)
Casino fuck your baby mama (Hold up , 21)
We don't play around with that drama
