[Hook: Bullet]
In this organized crime
Everything gotta be precise
And everything gotta be on time
Nigga organized crime
Walk light chalk lesson
Always keep a sharp mind
Nigga organized crime
It's gone be good it's gone bad
But that's all part of the grind
When you live an organized crime
But Most important keep that......by ya side
Nigga organized crime

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I Ke....I keep that shit by my side dog. ( 21, 21)
I walk around with that iron dog
I gotta 30 on my 9 dog
I keep a stick like I'm blind dog
Young Savage really from the streets
Put em on a plate and ima eat
Steak, Cake I want money like Bill Gates
I won't pull up in a Wraith
Spent some hundred on some bake
Spent a hundred on my baby
Blowing money like a baby
Blowing money like a Floyd
I'm the plug in court
Slaughter Gang got the sword
