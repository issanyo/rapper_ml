[Verse 1: Barloe Team]
Used to being on the road
Now we rolling hella' dope
My girl and life, she strike a pose
Errytime you see 'er bro
Front pay centerfold
Not the token niggas though
We them niggas niggas know
Keep it pimpin' figure roll
Iced out nigga rope
Heavy way to Cuban, oh
Sit this good, you just need a clone
Run this house, my Adidas on
Smoked out, young [?] along
Boy, you broke, you could use a loan
Sitting pretty, got them titties [?]
Margaret's room, we been gettin' it on
Shell Toes kicked out
MAC, Glock, smear it out
Fuck, skrt off
Yikes, yeeks, pints, peace
Spade, who got them sweet-sixteens?

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Double-dutch, and hoes used to jumpin'
Troubled world, and my music bustin'
Fuck the word, yeah, we used to thuggin'
Got a chain, gotta make it something
Why you frontin'? Need for-real budget
Gold for gold, might as well, fuck it
Slubbin' always tryna' sell somethin'
Actin' if these nigga' mail somethin'
That fame shit got a cough
My new thing count a boss
You know we gettin' it, ain't gotta floss
Roamin' through the city, I was lost
Where was you, man, you never call
On the phone, know when labels call
Bless the streets, I got a sacred heart

[Verse 3: Barloe Team]
You know what they gon' say
Whatever they feel like, cos' you gon' do the same
Whenever you feel like you gotta know who they gon' blame
Had to learn how to move
Couple vultures in the room
Had to learn how to use my tools
God's great, I'm great, yeah
Celebrate everyday, pray
Thank god for today, ay
Earn another 8-ball, the 'nother half talkin' 'bout the bay
I just need a Benz, I need [?] askin'
For a dare, yeah I got a word
You ain't have to work, but you gotta work
Gotta show your daddy's work, woo
Reminiscing we was on the perc
Fresh trippin', he was on them percs
Goose trippin', me above the worst
I miss my nigga, shoulda' called him first

[Spoken Word: Barloe Team]
Fuck, fuck nigga
[?] got rap no more
That shit was [?] five, bro
This might bring the hood back in itself
My shit only
Slugg maggin'
808 the motherfuckin' Mafia, nigga

[Outro: Erykah Badu]
I'm a recovering undercover over-lover
Recovering from a love I can't get over
