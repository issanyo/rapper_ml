[Intro]
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, 21, 21

[Verse 1]
Got a vacuum sealed machine and a digital scale
Ridin’ in a new 'Rari and I'm lookin’ for 12
Tommy guns and trench coats, wackin’ like Joe Pesci
Actin’ like I owe you somethin’ you gon' miss yo blessin’
CVS drugs, lean, pills, one-stop shop
I got big big bullets, that’s a one shot Glock
And I fucked yo baby mama, she cannot give Top
I make savage music nigga, this is not hip-hop

[Chorus]
Hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop, nigga
Hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop
Nigga spent a hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop, nigga
Hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop
Nigga spent a hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop, nigga
Hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop
Nigga spent a hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop, nigga
Hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop
He ain't bout the money I ain't talkin', nigga
He ain't bout the money get to walkin', nigga
And I got your main bitch stalkin' nigga
Put a hole in yo' head like a dolphin nigga
Fur costs 100, that’s ostrich nigga
Swimmin’ in the pussy, that’s aqua, nigga
Diamonds drippin’ on me that’s faucet, nigga
All my niggas on they own boss shit, nigga

[Verse 2]
Skrt skrt skrt, pyrex on lock
Pew! pew! silence on that Heckler and Koch
I’m sippin’ Actavis nigga, this ain't scotch
I listen to yo tape and nigga you ain't hot
Young Savage, man this shit so easy
Nigga so high, that I’m talkin’ to Jesus
Bitch I want no pussy, bitch get on yo knees-us
Nigga watch where you walkin’, you just stepped on my Yeezys

[Chorus]
Hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop, nigga
Hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop
Nigga spent a hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop, nigga
Hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop
Nigga spent a hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop, nigga
Hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop
Nigga spent a hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop, nigga
Hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop
He ain't bout the money I ain't talkin', nigga
He ain't bout the money get to walkin', nigga
And I got your main bitch stalkin' nigga
Put a hole in yo' head like a dolphin nigga
Fur costs 100, that’s ostrich nigga
Swimmin’ in the pussy, that’s aqua, nigga
Diamonds drippin’ on me that’s faucet, nigga
All my niggas on they own boss shit, nigga

[Verse 3]
Chains on rains on diamonds on free nigga
Tryna turn that bitch into your wife and she the squeeze nigga
Saint Laurent and Goyard gon cover all of me nigga
And I’m reckless, check shit, Nike nigga
And I keep a uzi, shoot a movie, Spike Lee nigga
And I’m on that Act, I poured a four and ice tea, nigga
Thought you was a gangsta, you detective Ice-T nigga
Tryna clone a nigga, bummy boy you not me, nigga

[Chorus]
Hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop, nigga
Hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop
Nigga spent a hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop, nigga
Hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop
Nigga spent a hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop, nigga
Hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop
Nigga spent a hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop, nigga
Hunnid on a mothafuckin' drop
He ain't bout the money I ain't talkin', nigga
He ain't bout the money get to walkin', nigga
And I got your main bitch stalkin' nigga
Put a hole in yo' head like a dolphin nigga
Fur costs 100, that’s ostrich nigga
Swimmin’ in the pussy, that’s aqua, nigga
Diamonds drippin’ on me that’s faucet, nigga
All my niggas on they own boss shit, nigga
