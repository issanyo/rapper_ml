[Intro: 21 Savage]
CashMoneyAP!
White diamonds 'round my motherfuckin' neck, nigga
I'm the Saint Laurent killer, nigga
ChadG (21, 21)

[Hook: 21 Savage]
Called up your bitch come to suck on my dick (woah, woah)
Took it too quick & she busted her lip (woah, woah)
Bet I'm a savage, I sleep wit a stick (woah, woah)
Aim at them niggas that try to get slick (pew, pew)

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I'm the Saint Laurent killer, niggas know it  (yeah, yeah)
I be droppin' 20 racks, can't be throwin' it (21, 21)
See, my wrists hurt from whippin' up the soda (yeah, yeah)
Last night, I got head in a Toyota (hehe)
Sick!

[Verse 2: Reef]
It's the young Reefy
Like I'm Cena, niggas can't see me
Like I'm 'bino, I'mma don c-ting
All these non-believers down bleedin'
I be spinnin' all these suckers like a CD
I be pressin' haters buttons like I'm Dee Dee
I'mma do it big and new for my whole city
Holy shit, this nigga raw, you wasn't kidding, huh?
Wait a minute, it's that Reef (mmm)
He be eatin' every track like it's some beef (mmm)
Sayin' corny lines, he actin' like Dicky  (mmm)
I don't care what you say, bitch, I got the keys
Like Alicia Keys, swizzin' on the beat
Got no time for fake friends or time to sleep
Turned into a beast, this is my release
Way up like a priest, bless 'em he a G (Takeoff)

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Here go the flow, they all do
Tryna claim, nobody do it
I can say weird shit, it cool
I be fartin' in the pool (pootin!)
I'mma cow and I say "moo" (facts!)
I just be sippin' the goo  (sipping it!)
I just be whippin' up eggs in the kitchen
I chop up the chicken for school

[Break: Reef]
Best Migo, hands down

[Hook: 21 Savage]
Called up your bitch come to suck on my dick (woah, woah)

Bet I'm a savage, I sleep wit a stick (woah, woah)
Aim at them niggas that try to get slick (pew, pew)

[Verse 4: 21 Savage]
I be Gucci'd up to my fuckin' neck, dawg
I be iced out, I'm fuckin' up a check, dawg
It's a whole lot of niggas trying to flex on me
Used to shoot 'em, now I beat 'em, it's a better me
Bitch, I'm Mad Max, I make fast cash
Got a bag pack filled with fat stacks
Got a bad bitch with a fat ass and a bald head
Let me smash that

[Verse 5: Reef]
Damn, let me smack it like Akon
Ain't a scrub like Faison
No disrespect, but I'm chasin'
That money for my momma mansion
Couple months, I'll be the best out
Nigga, Reefy takin' over, no doubt
Nigga and I'm nerdy, I'mma boss out
Nigga, everybody playin' Fallout, nigga
"Who you kidding?
You will never fit in, you a lame old nigga
Bet your verses written
You ain't pullin' triggers, nigga, you ain't sippin'
What the fuck you 'bout to do to prove you different?"
Bitch, I'mma just be myself like all the greats
I'mma be blerdy and give niggas faith
I'mma take time out my motherfuckin' day
To give back to the people that paved out my way
Now look, that's no disrespect to they struggle (hell no)
Most them niggas out there shootin', 'cause they got to
Look, I just grew up a little different
We all black to the cops, nigga who you kiddin'
Takin' shots at our back like we Scotty Pippen
Take a look at yourself, nigga, just admit it (uh)
