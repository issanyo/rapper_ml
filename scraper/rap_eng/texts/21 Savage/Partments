[Intro]
Yah
Yah
Yah, Yah, Yah
We got ____ in the room man
Know I'm sayin
Young savage in the booth man
Gold all on the keyboard

[Verse 1]
Somebody pray for these niggas
I load up and spray on these niggas
I keep a K on me nigga
I keep a K on me nigga
I ain't got no love for these bitches
I'm making blood on these bitches
I keep a rubber on me bitch
I keep a rubber on me bitch
Fifty round drum in that stick
Young Savage pull up n' hit
Jewelry on me, yeah that water shit
Tell with the gang, you get slaughtered quick
Order bricks and then the order hits
Call the Uber, she a boring bitch
Want a trap, I got the starter kit
I stay with Boot like a Dora bitch

[Hook]
Just another bad young nigga from the partments
Just another bad young nigga from the partments
Just another bad young nigga from the partments
Just another bad young nigga from the partments
Bitch I keep a choppa think I should'a said a Harley
I be in the kitchen whippin white, iCarly
I don't play no game, pussy boy this ain't Atari
Lyin ass rappers man I'm tired of ya story

[Verse 1]
Lyin ass rappers, (bitch)
Fake ass trappers, (bitch)
Young Savage pull up, roll the window down and clap you
I don't want that fishy pussy bitch you smell like Snappers
I just poured up four of Activis inside a Snapple
.223 it hit a nigga look like he got tackled
All these Cuban links on me look like I got shackles
I got good finesse bitch, nigga you got gaffled
The way I dunk inside that pussy bitches say I Shaq-attack em', Bitch nigga please
Gas make me sneeze
Got her on her knees
Suck till you can't breathe
"Young Savage", "Yo"
Pull on yo hoe
Pull up to the ___?
You can get a O
