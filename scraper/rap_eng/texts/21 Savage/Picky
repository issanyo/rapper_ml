[Chorus: 21 Savage]
I'm so motherfucking picky
She ain't fucking then she dipping
If it ain't tinted, I ain't in it
Cuz I'm so motherfucking picky
Thousand dollars on Giuseppe's
You better watch where you stepping
I'm young, dumb and I'm reckless
Eighty thousand on a necklace
Cuz I'm so motherfucking picky

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I'm fucking picky, 21 Savage all I do is count digits
I cook a brick, I flip a brick, I fucking whip it
I hit Lenox, spend ten, I'm fucking ridiculous
I pulled up on his bitch, she acting stiff
Bitch you better suck a dick or you gotta dip
I got real shooters 'round me, they gone fucking flip
You don't see this fucking extendo, better watch ya lip
Cuz we'll trip nigga
The money come first and these bitches last nigga
I like counting cash nigga, I like smoking gas nigga
200 on the dash nigga, all my cars fast
All my bitches thick, I love a fat ass

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
I'm so motherfucking picky
She ain't fucking then she dipping
If it ain't tinted, I ain't in it
Cuz I'm so motherfucking picky
Thousand dollars on Giuseppe's
You better watch where you stepping
I'm young, dumb and I'm reckless
Eighty thousand on a necklace
Cuz I'm so motherfucking picky

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I'm young dumb and I'm reckless
I'm playing with blocks like tetris
I don't tote smith and Wesson
This a Glock 40 get to stepping
This dope came from Peru, I got a deuce deuce in my shoe
I got santan, wanna boot?
I bought my side ho a coupe
That bitch came with no roof
These niggas lying I'm the truth
21, 21, 21
21 Savage, I'm in love with the money
Got a hundred round drum, on the bottom of my Tommy
Baw baw baw! graw graw graw!
Pussy nigga get to running, boot up, boot up, like a motherfucking zombie

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
I'm so motherfucking picky
She ain't fucking then she dipping
If it ain't tinted, I ain't in it
Cuz I'm so motherfucking picky
Thousand dollars on Giuseppe's
You better watch where you stepping
I'm young, dumb and I'm reckless
Eighty thousand on a necklace
Cuz I'm so motherfucking picky
