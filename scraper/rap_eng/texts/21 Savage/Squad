They say you ain't goin' hard like you used to
Man what's goin' on?
They say they want that mothafuckin' 2013 feel, man
What's goin' on, man?
They say you ain't goin' hard, Bib

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
I say I'm still goin' hard for the squad, swear to God
All these niggas in their feelings, they be actin' like some broads
'Bout to buy a mansion in the A for the squad
Niggas in their feelings, they be actin' like some broads
Say I'm still goin' hard for the squad, swear to God

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
I say I don't rock with niggas, 'cause they're fake and they're fraud
All my youngins pull his card, and they down to catch a charge
See you talk it, but I live it, yeah all my niggas with it
When it come to the money, I'm a savage, I go get it
I just be countin' them faces, I just be flyin' to places
Used to record in the basement, young Hov in the makin'
Bibby Ross, I'm the boss, buy it all, fuck the cost
Every king take a loss, goin' hard, never soft

'Bout to buy a mansion in the A for the squad
Niggas in their feelings, they be actin' like some broads
Say I'm still goin' hard for the squad, swear to God
All these niggas in their feelings, they be actin' like some broads
'Bout to buy a mansion in the A for the squad
I don't rock with niggas, they some fakes and they're frauds
