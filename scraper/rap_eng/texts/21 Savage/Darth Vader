[Intro]
If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus: Offset]
Yeah, the game I finessed it, yeah (ooh)
I count up the blessings (count up the blessings)
The diamonds is precious
Ain't having no pressure (no)
I bought the plain Philippe, they said I was being too extra (plain)
I brought the gang with me, Kel-Tec with the suppressor
(the gang)
Recording all night, she sleep
Bitch wake up, this dick is for breakfast (wake-up)
Oh, you tryna vibe with me? You gotta be day one, no lesser (hey)
Got camera surveillance 'cause all of us made it
The mansion is gated (mansion is gated)
We go gladiator, snub, nose a potato
All black like Darth Vader (yeah)

[Verse 1: Offset]
Big Bentayga take the whole lane
Ain't no room for a hater (whole lane)
Private jet with the whole gang
When I get home, it'll wait (whole gang)
Ain't 'bout to pick up my phone today (brrrr)
No nigga 'bout to get wet up (brrrr)
Wanna bet up? (who)
Got hoes in the Nawf on the set up (set up)
Look at my right wrist, 'guettes
Sparkles in the watch like X (x)
Karats on my neck have sex (woo)
Fifty-seven nineties on deck (seven ninety)
Runnin' from demons, angels in my dream when I'm leanin' (angels)
Tec-9 wit' the beam (brp brp)
Don't nobody move before the shit start ringing (bow)
Hold your horses, I'm a go cop me a roll of Forgis (wait)
Hop out the Range and ghost it (drip)
Luggage on planes is Goyard (luggage)
Got a Mexican plug and a señorita (hey)
This shit hold a dub, turn a nigga to the Grim Reaper (yeah)

[Chorus: Offset]
Yeah, the game I finessed it, yeah (ooh)
I count up the blessings (count up the blessings)
The diamonds is precious
Ain't having no pressure (no)
I bought the plain Philippe, they said I was being too extra (plain)
I brought the gang with me, he killed 10 with the suppressor
(the gang)
Recording all night, she sleep
Bitch wake up, this dick is for breakfast (wake-up)
Oh, you tryna vibe with me? You gotta be there with no lesser (hey)
Got camera surveillance 'cause all of us made it
The mansion is gated (mansion is gated)
We go gladiator, snub, nose a potato
All black like Darth Vader (yeah)
