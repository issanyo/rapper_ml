[Intro: Gucci Mane]
East Atlanta Day
We don't fuck with 12, nigga
East Atlanta Day
Nigga, East Atlanta Day

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I just pulled up in a Lambo on East Atlanta Day
Drop top don, nigga, East Atlanta Day
I got all my jewelry on, nigga, East Atlanta Day
It's a trap holiday, nigga, East Atlanta Day
30s on the truck, nigga, East Atlanta Day
I'ma make them put it up, nigga, East Atlanta Day
Nigga, we don't give a fuck, nigga, East Atlanta Day
Where ya from? Throw it up, nigga, East Atlanta Day

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Walkin' through my hood, lookin' like a hundred bricks
I got all this ice on me, shouldn't even brought out all this shit
It's Zaytoven and C-Note and Big Gucci in this bitch
Nigga put his hands on me, I'm goin' stupid in this bitch
Eight-figure Gucci and I'm lookin' like the shit
I got so much cash right now, don't know what to with all this shit
Yo girlfriend lookin' at me like a groupie in this bitch
So I'm 'bouta shoot my shot, I feel like Cupid in this bitch
This for Edgewood, this for Kirkwood, I brought Glenwood in this bitch
Got me feeling like a young nigga, might pull up with the stick
Two hundred thousand dollar watch, I look just like a lick
And the way lil' mama switchin', you can tell she from the 6

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I just pulled up in a Lambo on East Atlanta Day
Drop top don, nigga, East Atlanta Day
I got all my jewelry on, nigga, East Atlanta Day (Brr!)
It's a trap holiday, nigga, East Atlanta Day
Drop top Chevelle, nigga, East Atlanta Day
I'ma give them hell, nigga, East Atlanta Day
We don't fuck with 12, nigga, East Atlanta Day
Nigga, East Atlanta Day, nigga, East Atlanta Day

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
21 and PDE, that's the East Atlanta gang, (Gang)
I shot a lot of niggas with this East Atlanta 'K (21)
I robbed a lot of niggas in North Atlanta for their yay (Facts)
They didn't get no skraightenin', but they feel some type of way
Drop down, broad day, niggas that Zone 6 shit (Yeah)
We ain't shoot nothin' but them sticks (Yeah)
Hit his car so many times, it did a backflip (Yeah)
I ain't got nun for a bitch, but a fat dick (21)
Leave a nigga with a fat lip, yeah, chains on me blingin' ho
Fucked yo baby momma, yo kid's Pampers need some changin' ho (21)
All I hang around is drug dealers, killas, bangin' ho (21)
We run East Atlanta, dare you think we don't come skraightenin' ho

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I just pulled up in a Lambo on East Atlanta Day

I got all my jewelry on, nigga, East Atlanta Day (Brr!)
It's a trap holiday, nigga, East Atlanta Day
