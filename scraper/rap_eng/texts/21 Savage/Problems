[Chorus: Casino]
Loud rolled on my hip, that's the extendo
Got a book bag on, what's in it? a draco
Major game, got them beams on them sticks
Keep a thirty-eight, I keep them shells with me
You don't want no problems, you don't want these problems
You don't want no problems, you don't want no problems
You don't want these problems, you don't want no problems
You don't want no problems, you don't want these problems

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Four-five with that dick on it
Sweet move, I put my bitch on it
Travel all around the world with that stick on me
Got a nigga life savings on my wrist, don't it
Casino fucked your baby mama, hold up
We don't play 'round with that drama, hold up
My bank account it got them commas, hold up
I'm bombing shit like I'm Osama, hold up
Do the dash in this motherfucker
Fuck your bitch without a fuckin' rubber
I ran off with your work and you didn't get not strength
I'm killin' like a Muslim, I don't eat no bacon

[Chorus: Casino]
Loud rolled on my hip, that's the extendo
Got a book bag on, what's in it? a draco
Major game, got them beams on them sticks
Keep a thirty-eight, I keep them shells with me
You don't want no problems, you don't want these problems
You don't want no problems, you don't want no problems
You don't want these problems, you don't want no problems
You don't want no problems, you don't want these problems

[Verse 2: Casino]
Red head, red pants, red shoes, rrrah
Red truck, red guns, red feet, slatt
I ain't worried a whole bunch of [?], I can get your ass whacked
AK lil nigga KB dot on the draco
Five-fifty, dae dae, wanye Glock, that paper trail
One blood call a nigga, all them pull up, they with it
Sticks on five-forty, loud around thirty-eight, shit bow
Casino walk around, yeah he the real bossman, really now yeah
Big chains on big swang, got the chain-ganging on lock
Pullin' off in a Rari car, blue like Meech, skrrt, gone
Watch out, Balmain jeans on me with a whole lot of hundreds in 'em
Keep a pistol on me January all the way to December

[Chorus: Casino]
Loud rolled on my hip, that's the extendo
Got a book bag on, what's in it? a draco
Major game, got them beams on them sticks
Keep a thirty-eight, I keep them shells with me
You don't want no problems, you don't want these problems
You don't want no problems, you don't want no problems
You don't want these problems, you don't want no problems
You don't want no problems, you don't want these problems

[Outro: Casino]
And there you have it
Two of Atlanta's most wanted bitch
Y'all don't want no problems lil boy
Sit your lil bitch ass down

[Chorus: Casino]
Loud rolled on my hip, that's the extendo
Got a book bag on, what's in it? a draco
Major game, got them beams on them sticks
Keep a thirty-eight, I keep them shells with me
