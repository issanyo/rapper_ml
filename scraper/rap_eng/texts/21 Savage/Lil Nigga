[Hook: No Plug]
I'm that lil nigga that really be trappin'
All of my niggas they really be cappin'
All my of my niggas they live for that action
I'm that lil nigga that pull up in that Aston
I'm that lil nigga put you up on fashion
I'm that lil nigga networkin' in traffic
I'm the lil nigga who gon' let you have it
Shoot like Number 4 from the one from Mavericks
I'm that lil nigga dumb diamonds like Jerry
All of em niggas they talkin' like Perry
Check out my arm, that bitch got 'em carats
Pocket full of money, the boy got (?)

[Verse 1: No Plug]
Check out my charm, that bitch is outstandin'
I'm that lil nigga that bitch can expand it
See the head cap, made the bitch vanish
You the lil nigga who went in (?)
All of my hoes, they went in Giuseppe
Standin' in crowds, we buyin' the section
All of my niggas they drinkin' on texas
I'm that lil nigga with zips for 11
Might break it down, but bricks I'm sellin
Trap jumpin' like (?)
When I have to touch down, a nigga had to sell it
Had to fuck a nigga bitch, I'm petty
Bottom of the watch it'll make a nigga jelly
I'm a shootin guard (?)
If a nigga try me then a nigga gon' get it
Say my name, I'mma have a nigga blitzin'

VVSin' nigga drip on my neck
Coolin' system, it came with the tec
Bitch I'm a player, can't pay for my set
Look at my wrist and the pussy got wet
Money comin' like it grew off a tree
We won't smoke you niggas callin' police

My bitch at home so I'mma fuck in the jeep

I'm that lil nigga that fuck on the couch
