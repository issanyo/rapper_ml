[Intro: Future]
If Young Metro don't trust ya, I'm gon shoot ya

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Get my Maybach washed at the studio
I'm passing out xans to the groupie hoes
I got five on a Lamb' like Coolio
Multi-millionaire, now I'm hanging with the shooters tho
Yeah, bust downs, got a few of those
Yeah, bitch stop calling my phone, I'm in the studio
Yeah, nigga we ain't doing no Twitter, lil nigga get supersoaked
Nigga we ain't playing both sides, lil nigga who you rooting for?

[Verse 1: NAV]
My life is a secret, everything confidential
Rollie presidential, working on my mental
Ready for the pressure (yeah) 38 special (yeah)
Aim it at your temple (yeah), shooters behind me driving in a rental
Told his mama, "Sorry for your loss, did you get the flowers that I sent you?"
Used to sell my beats for two bills, now you can't even get a sample
Mama found the work in a closet
I was making shoe box deposits
Ain't looking back, change the topic
Park a Bentley coupe in the projects
Told my ex bitch I'm doing great, yah
So much ice, I need some skates, yah
Playing two sides, my shooter put three in his face, yah
I just spent eleven on my waist, yah
I dress like a star, my closet running out of space, yah

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Get my Maybach washed at the studio
I'm passing out xans to the groupie hoes
I got five on a Lamb' like Coolio
Multi-millionaire, now I'm hanging with the shooters tho
Yeah, bust downs, got a few of those
Yeah, bitch stop calling my phone, I'm in the studio
Yeah, nigga we ain't doing no Twitter, lil nigga get supersoaked
Nigga we ain't playing both sides, lil nigga who you rooting for?

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Woah, Gucci jacket, inside pocket hold the ratchet
OG kush I'm smoking on a potent package
Saint Laurent don on me
And I got a gun on me
Can't no infiltrators come around me
Told my son don't suck his thumb around me
Issa lotta bloodhounds around me
You could get gunned down around me
Yeah, all my friends bad guys
Search him at the door, he might be wearing a wire
In a foreign, drinking syrup, that's a DUI
Police ass nigga, you the FBI

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Get my Maybach washed at the studio
I'm passing out xans to the groupie hoes
I got five on a Lamb' like Coolio
Multi-millionaire, now I'm hanging with the shooters tho
Yeah, bust downs, got a few of those
Yeah, bitch stop calling my phone, I'm in the studio
Yeah, nigga we ain't doing no Twitter, lil nigga get supersoaked
Nigga we ain't playing both sides, lil nigga who you rooting for?

[Outro: 21 Savage]
I'm sleeping where the killers at
I'm hanging on a fed block
Yeah, Glock 40 with a red dot
Ten racks for a headshot
