[Chorus: Travis Scott]
All my niggas outside
Ain't goin' in, yeah
We been hangin' outside
Ain't goin' in

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, automatic
Yeah, always got it on me baby, automatic, yeah
Where I'm at is static, but it ain't got traffic, yeah
Push up on me, them boys make you do a backflip
Balance on the beam, yeah, balance on the beam, yeah
Do some shit I've never seen
Won't you come ride with the team, yeah
Yeah, you might just win a ring, yeah
While they home on they homescreens

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
And all my niggas outside
Ain't goin' in, yeah
We been hangin' outside
Ain't goin' in

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
We been hangin' outside, not goin' in
Outside, not goin' in
Pull up in a Lambo or just with the Benz
Checkin' out, never checkin' in
We been outside, not goin' in
Hope you had a mattress when you sleepin' on me
Hope you got some backup if you creepin' on me
'Cause just last week I rest in peace'd a homie
Why you do it? Why you switch up? (ooo)
Was it for the image or for the pictures? (ooo)
You always seem to show up when I'm at the mixes
'Cause you know I'm not myself when I'm off the liquor
Off the lean, it's always better off the lean

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
All my niggas outside
Ain't goin' in, yeah
We been hangin' outside
Ain't goin' in
All my niggas outside

[Verse 3: 21 Savage]
21, 21, 21, 21
All my niggas outside
Pillow talkin' sneak dissin' get a nigga jaw wired
Beat yo baby mama throat so long she say her jaw's tired
Young Savage get a nigga whacked cause I got mob ties
I'm a wise guy
All my niggas in the field
I'm draped in Avianne, I ain't got a deal
Slaughter Gang and PDE, we killin' shit for real (21, 21)
Ten bad bitches, suckin' dick and eatin' pills (what?)
And I keep that Tommy, nigga, and I ain't talkin' Hil (21)
And I be on mud, I get mad if it spill (yeah)
Bitch, I know your baby daddy probably wanna kill (kill)
I'm a real nigga, fuck niggas can’t feel (21)
Plus I get inside that bowl and skrt, skrt, skrt
Hit it from the back pull up her skirt (21)

Bitch, I’m outside on the percs, percs, percs (21, 21, 21)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
All my niggas outside
Ain't goin' in, yeah
We been hangin' outside
Ain't goin' in
All my niggas outside
