[Verse 1 : TYuS]
I don't see nothing wrong (nothing wrong)
With a little bump and grind
Even though it ain't mines (ain't mines)
So call me when your man's not home
And I pull up on you late night
Just to turn you on (turn you on)
And we know it's going down
If I get you alone (get you alone)
And once I'm in it, all up in it
I prolly never make it home
Tonight I just want to get to know you very well
As long as you won't tell

[Hook: TYuS]
What we do
What we do
What we do
Is between me and you (me and you)
What we do (what we do)
What we do
Ain't nobody has to know
No, no, baby

[Chorus: TYuS]
Watching you I start to realize (realize)
You need someone different in your life (in your life)
So I'm gon' please you, you, you, tonight
Can't you see, that all I really wanted was your time (your time)
I wanna get a chance to make it right
And we got all night to make it right
Ohh, baby, yeah

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
21
Baby let me get inside it
When she ride it "ohh, shit"

She leave me, I might loose it
21, I'm ruthless (ruthless)
I love buying new shit (new shit)
All my bitches boujee (boujee)
All my bitches ooh (21)
All my diamonds ooh, ooh
Then I drop the top like ooh, ooh
I might put a ring on it ooh, ooh
Fresh up out the shower she the truth, truth
Fresh up out the shower, gettin' loose, loose
Look like honey and I got a sweet tooth, tooth
Bitches gon' hate cause they wanna be you (21)
Don't let them get between us baby, they against you, you
Having this shit
Bugs Bunny nigga got karats and shit (karats and shit)
She loves the way I be swaggin' and shit (swaggin')

Got a nigga thinkin' bout marriage and shit (woah)

Lookin' up to me, got her twistin' fingaz and shit (21)
You know I had to put a ring up on that shit (ring up)
Said she gon' put her name on that dick (name on)
I put a Audemar plain on her wrist (rain on it)
She wanted Lexus, told her it ain't shit (ain't shit)
Fuck the next bitch stay ain't on shit
You can't name a bitch that I ain't hit
I ain't never had a bitch hit like this (21)
Relationship goals, look at our wrist (21)
We just flexin' on our X (21)

[Hook: TYuS]

Ain't nobody has to know
No, no, baby

[Chorus: TYuS]
Watching you I start to realize (realize)
You need someone different in your life (in your life)
So I'm gon' please you, you, you, tonight
Can't you see, that all I really wanted was your time (your time)
I wanna get a chance to make it right
And we got all night to make it right
Ohh, baby, yeah

No, no, no
