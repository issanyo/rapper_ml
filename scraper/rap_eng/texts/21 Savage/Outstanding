[Chorus: SahBabii]
From a whole 'nother planet (planet)
Ice on my neck dancin' (dancin')
Ice on my neck prancin' (prancin')
Got these lil' hoes glancin' (glancin')
Ice on me outstandin' ('standin')
Baby girl so demandin'
Say she is my standards

[Verse 1: SahBabii]
Boy, yeah, I'm so frantic
Fuckin' these hoes, outlandish
I need a ho like granny
I'm eatin' them cookies like candy
I'm eatin' them cookies like candy
Swear them tools come in handy
Handy just like Manny
These niggas shrimp, you a scampi
Scampi
I'm gettin' choked by chokers
Cough drop me, my throat hurt
Ice on my bitch then yoked her
Say you cold, we colder
We get cold 'til your nose hurt
She suck dick 'til my toes curl
Then she burp, yeah
These niggas ain't seein' me
Came from the bottom bikini
Now these bitches on my weenie
Niggas small, yeah they teeny
Ice on me outstandin'
Money keep expandin', do you understand me?

[Chorus: SahBabii]
From a whole 'nother planet (planet)
Ice on my neck dancin' (dancin')
Ice on my neck prancin' (prancin')
Got these lil' hoes glancin' (glancin')
Ice on me outstandin' ('standin')
Baby girl so demandin'
Say she is my standards

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
21, ice on my neck go bling (bling)
Fairy tale, sell a ho a dream (God)
25 racks on the ring (bling, bling, bling)
Yeah, VVS' on me, they water, yeah
I don't want your bitch, I bought her, yeah
You can get her back, I borrowed her (21, 21, 21, 21)
Ice on my neck like puck, puck
I'm a big dawg, you a duck, (duck)
Fuck her like a dog and get stuck
Every, every car I ride in need a green card, foreign
Foreign bitch pussy good, I bought a green card
But I swear it get so wet I wish I had a surfboard (21)

[Chorus: SahBabii]
From a whole 'nother planet (planet)
Ice on my neck dancin' (dancin')
Ice on my neck prancin' (prancin')
Got these lil' hoes glancin' (glancin')
Ice on me outstandin' ('standin')
Baby girl so demandin'
Say she is my standards
From a whole 'nother planet (planet)
Ice on my neck dancin' (dancin')
Ice on my neck prancin' (prancin')
Got these lil' hoes glancin' (glancin')
Ice on me outstandin' ('standin')
Baby girl so demandin'
Say she is my standards

[Outro: SahBabii]
