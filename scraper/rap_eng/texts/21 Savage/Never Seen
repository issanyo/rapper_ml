[Intro: Loso Loaded]
Judo
Ninth ward
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 1: Loso Loaded]
When you approach a real nigga, better think first
I'm just a young shooter straight up out the red dirt (blaow)
Smokin' Cali pack, I can't even smoke purp (oh no)
Used to trap out the nicks, sell chirp-chirp (brr, brr)
Birds in my rear view, dirty got thirty bands (yeah, yeah)
Serve 'em through the window, had a lil' nigga bitch
Spot smokin' indo (what)
Actin' for a nigga, they be actin' sentimental
Whoa, whoa, whoa (oh no, oh no, oh no)
That's on a bitch, straight gun down that fuck boy (what, whoa, whoa)
Put him on display
I copped a Rollie, it came with the big face (blaow, blaow, shine)
Chop down that brick, nigga, I'm master sensei
Run through the racks, nigga, I'm on a rat race
Ain't always been up, but I grind on my bad days (whoa)
Wait 'til they see them brand new paper tags day
I'm in the fast lane (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Loso Loaded]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me
One, two, three, four chains on white tee (bling)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me
Five, six, seven, eight grand on white tee (no)

[Verse 2: 21 Savage & Loso Loaded]
VVSs on me bling blaow
We movin' silent, but the weed loud
Choppa kickin' like kung-pow
Nut all on a nigga bitch, ha
Sprayin' bitches with that Ace of Spades
Hit 'em in the temple, pew, fade
Get some money, watch these niggas fade
Loso rollin' loaded, catch a play
You ain't never seen a nigga like me, hold up
Do the right thing, nigga, Spike Lee, hold up
Pour me up a four inside a iced tea, hold up
Knock a nigga out like Ali, hold up
You ain't never seen a nigga, spendin'
Come through like Obama, bitch I'm tinted
Everything you niggas got, you rented
Rappin' all your life, and I'm independent
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Chorus: Loso Loaded]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me
One, two, three, four chains on white tee (bling)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me
Five, six, seven, eight grand on white tee
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me
One, two, three, four chains on white tee (bling)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (no)
Five, six, seven, eight grand on white tee (no, no, no)

[Verse 3: Loso Loaded]
Y-you ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like this (oh no)
And I do the Rollie, not the Breitling (shine)
Pull up in that motherfucker shining (yeah)
Hellcat it run, and boy, that motherfucker hauling (skrr, skrr)
Name a bitch in the city I ain't motherfuckin' doggin'
I should've kept hoopin' 'cause I was motherfuckin' balling (ballin')
Ain't wastin' no time, nigga I ain't motherfuckin' stallin' (oh no, oh no)
Get the commas, get the cash (yeah, yeah)
I'ma pull up in a foreign, nigga do the dash (skrr, skrr)
I got niggas, they'll rob your ass without a mask (blaow, blaow)
Loso Loaded, he ain't never goin' out bad (oh no)
Whoa, whoa, I had to switch up the face (switch it up, switch it up)
Wells Fargo, I don't bank with no Chase (oh no)
Felipe with me, that my motherfuckin' ace (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)

[Chorus: Loso Loaded]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me
One, two, three, four chains on white tee (bling)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me
Five, six, seven, eight grand on white tee
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me
One, two, three, four chains on white tee (bling)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (no)
Five, six, seven, eight grand on white tee (no, no, no)

[Outro: Loso Loaded]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't, you ain't never seen a nigga like me (oh no)
