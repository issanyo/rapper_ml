Ain't no limit on the debit, I got paper (Yah Yah)
Don't be calling me ya brother, you a hater
Got new stones on my neck, nigga flooded out
Hurricane Irma on my neck, nigga, flooded out
Hurricane Harvey on my wrist, shit, flooded out
Nigga flooded out, VVS' flooded out
Hit the booty club, nigga, and we flooded out
Take a project bitch, and get her flooded out
You can build a bear, fuck it, I'm finna build a thot
Ice on a nigga nice lights out
Nigga bad, back on, finna put a pipe out
Got that 40 with the dick, nigga, right now
Ass was flat in middle school, but it's right now
I was robbing but I'm fucking with the mic now
I done growed up, nigga

Carbon 1 5 turn ya to a cold cut, nigga
Say you wanna pint, I'm flexing with the Robituss, nigga
Put a bomb in my pockets, they done blowed up, nigga

[Verse 2: Offset]
I'm a nawf side nigga
I don't switch sides, nigga (Nah)
Got that .45, nigga (Bam)

That's a big size difference
Richard Mille, one-on-one
That was a wise investment
We always going private (Private)
Always getting a profit (Bag)
Look at this glass I'm cracking
Told her go down, get sloppy (Ooh)
Big on big, don't size it
Birds that sing like The Isleys (Brrrr)

I get you whacked, I don't even call

You know I'ma dog
You know I'ma handle it when I got pressure (Hrrr)
I'm fucking your broad, I tell her to shut up, I give her no extras (smash)
No trespassing, mansion is gated

They too quick to tell it (12)
Fuck all them niggas they jealous
Fuck it we bigger than Elvis

[Chorus: 21 Savage & Offset]
