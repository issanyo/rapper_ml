Savage
21 Savage, the one and only
How it feel to be a real nigga man
21

[Verse 1]
The same niggas doubted me
Now they tryna hang around a nigga
Ain't got none' but bullets for you nigga
I feel like a bully to you nigga
I ain't countin' none' but hundreds nigga
Ain't none' but mud in my stomach nigga
I kept it real with a lot of niggas
Ain't gotta deal with a lot of niggas
I ain't sign no deal, I can't lie to niggas
So they don't treat me like I'm poppin', nigga
I kept it trill with all the trill niggas
I get accepted by the real niggas
I was raised to be a real nigga
Every nigga 'round me like to kill niggas
Red bottoms on a real nigga
She tryna suck it through the Hilfigers

[Hook]
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga

[Verse 2]
How it feel to be a real nigga
Bronx niggas say I'm ill nigga
Auto came, had to let it go
Now it ain't no place I can't go
Watch me thumb through that bankroll
Ain't no ones in this bankroll
Ain't none' but blues in this bitch, nigga
On boulevard with the crips, nigga
She got an ass but her titties little
But I hope she brought her sister with her
Cause you know I got a gang with me
You know ain't a damn thang changed with me
Got them VVS's on me now
Got them VVS's on me now
Look at my watch, this shit done cost a house
You talkin' to a boss, please watch your mouth
That boy came a long way, didn't he?
Yeah I came a long way, didn't he?
That boy came a long way, didn't he?
Now I'm ballin', Hardaway, Penny

[Hook]
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga
