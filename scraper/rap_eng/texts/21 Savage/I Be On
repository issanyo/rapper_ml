[Hook: YG]
I be on bullshit, I be on bullshit, I be on bullshit
I be on bullshit, I be on bullshit, I be on bullshit
I'm in the foreign with the full clip
Ridin' with the full clip on some rich bullshit
I'm in love with a hood bitch
I give her this good dick on some drunk bullshit

[Verse 1: YG]
If that's my pussy, put my name on it
If that's my pussy, put my name on it
Want me to wife it? Put my name on it
If I beat it out the frame, put my name on it
Order up some guns, add a gauge on it
I ain't playin' with these niggas and they know this (on Bloods)
That's my gun, I'ma hold it
And I ain't movin' like that, y'all know this
All this liquor fuckin' up my liver
All this money fuckin' up my niggas
All these bitches fuckin' up my main squeeze
Main squeeze hear this shit, she gon' hate me
Attitude how it is 'cause I don't give a fuck
Yea, I know I ain't right but I don't give a fuck
I know we ain't the same 'cause I think different
Who the one to blame? This drink, nigga!

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I'm in a Bentley with a dirty K (21)
Audemars cost a 100k
Got a bad bitch with me and her friend cute (21)
If that's my pussy, baby, go and get it tattooed
Butt crack showin' in that skirt (skrrrt, skrrrt)
She gon' hold that 30 in her purse
No Rihanna, I'ma make a bitch work (work, work)
My girl say I'm on a bullshit flirt (21)
I can't let a nigga do me like Ja Rule (never)
I ain't even really fuckin' with these rap dudes (21)
I'm with YG, fuckin' with the Pirus (and what?)
Fuck a nigga's baby mama in my house shoes (say what?)
Chain on, ring on, froze hoe (blinged out)
When you step into my spot, no clothes, hoe (21)
Baby joker no more, lock doors, hoe (21)
I'm on the bullshit, fuckin' with my bros, hoe (21, 21!)

[Verse 3: YG]
Drop 60 on the Benz and then skrrt off
Got some dust on my shoulders, get that dirt off
And got niggas that be tryna get that work off
You ain't never blew 50 bands? You's a jerk off
Got the AK, livin' in my mama's house
Fuck my baby mama at my mama's house
Bring all my drama to my mama's house
Thinkin' I'm a mama's boy, I hit you with that bla-da-da
Geeked, I'm ridin' dirty, nigga, hello
Bitch, make it wiggle like Jell-O
Sneak dissin' when I come around, you're mellow
Everything about you niggas' marshmallow
I can hit your bitch if I want to
But she set up for you so I don't want to
Ayy, I can hit the dealer when I want to
Hold up, just left the dealer and I copped two
