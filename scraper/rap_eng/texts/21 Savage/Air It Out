[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out

Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
I got the stick on me now
I got the stick on me now
Pull up and air shit out
I pull up and air shit out

[Post-Chorus: 21 Savage]
I pull up and air shit out, I pull up and dick your ho down
Young Savage, bitch, I got pounds, young Savage, bitch, I got rounds

[Interlude: 21 Savage]
Pew, pew (Grrrt, bah) pew-pew, (Bah) pew, (Bop-bop-bop-bop) frtttttt, fah (Grah, bop)

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Slaughter Gang, bitch, we go brazy, P-D-E, bitch, they go brazy
Drinkin' on lean got me lazy, Glock .40, no .380's
I'm cookin' up dope in this town
You need a new pistol it jammed
I don't fuck around with the Xans
I'm dripping, lil' bitch, I don't dab, your bitch a lil freak, ouch
I fuck her one time, bounce (Ha-ha, ha, ha)
Still got the choppa round' my motherfucking shoulder
Still that same nigga, I just got a little older

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Got that .30 on me now (A What?)
Got that .30 on me now (A what?)
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
I got the stick on me now (21)
I got the stick on me now (21)
Pull up and air shit out
I pull up and air shit out

[Verse 2: Young Nudy]
I got the stick on me now, pull up and air that bitch out
Glock 17 on me now, young nigga, shoot up your house
What that shit you talkin' 'bout? Look how that .30 hang out
Walk through the motherfucking crowd
Pussy nigga, shut your mouth
All of my young niggas killas, P-D-E, nigga, drug dealers
Nah, we don't fuck with you niggas
Get your ass slaughtered, lil nigga
I keep them 5th's on my pistols, I keep a hold on my stick
When that bitch click on don't miss, one and the head and I hit
Bitch, land straight in your temple
I told you, "don't fuck wit' me, nigga"
Shawty be popping them niggas, shawty be dropping them nigga
Now they called cops on a nigga 'cause they couldn't stop a lil' nigga
Right at the bottom, lil' nigga, P-D-E, Slaughter Gang, nigga

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
Got that .30 on me now
Got that .30 on me now
Pull up and air it out
Pull up and air it out
I got the stick on me now
I got the stick on me now
Pull up and air shit out
I pull up and air shit out
