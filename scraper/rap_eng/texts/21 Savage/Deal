[Intro: 21 Savage]
21
21

[Chorus: Casino]
We be closin' deals like a Floyd fight
We gon' look like Pacquiao, he got that white
Richard Mille two fifty, got no diamonds in it
Bentley, it's not tinted, want you see me in it
I done fucked that many hoes at Magic City
Verizon, my money up, my wifi lit
Ain't no thinkin' twice, you know I hit the lick (Freebandz)
I don't think nobody here can stunt like this

[Verse 1: Casino]
I just dropped a whole bird on my wrist
Check my neck, I check my neck, the charm a hockey puck
I just ordered ten racks and once I throwed it up
Been ballin' for like ten summers, I'm still goin' up
I just showed a million on the ground without a deal
Three thousand dollar pants where them racks is
You ought to kill yourself, you rockin' Giuseppes
Alexander McQueen when I'm steppin'
Balmain, Balmain, Balmain, steppin' the freshest
I'm rockin' three forty pointer diamond neck
Sixty pointer diamond for a charm
I'm lit up like a motherfuckin' stadium

[Chorus: Casino]
We be closin' deals like a Floyd fight
We gon' look like Pacquiao, he got that white
RIchard Muir two fifty, got no diamonds in it
Bentley, it's not tinted, want you see me in it
I done fucked that many hoes at Magic City
Verizon, my money up, my wifi lit
Ain't no thinkin' twice, you know I hit the lick
I don't think nobody here can stunt like this

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
AP skeleton, I got it bust down
Bought my bitch a Patek and it's bust down
Fuck around buy your bitch a Rollie if she bust down
Every time I get a back end that's a touch down
Ice on me check, yeah, benjis on me check, yeah
VVS's on me dawg, nigga look at my neck, yeah
All your diamonds cloudy boy, everything 'round me wet, yeah
Where you get that Gucci sweater, ain't come out 'til next year
I'm with Casino, 'bout to rob a casino (facts)
Made a half a ticket, nigga showin' Cee-Lo (racks)
I hit your main thing a gazebo (whack)
All these tennis chains, I no way I can be broke (check)

[Chorus: Casino]
We be closin' deals like a Floyd fight
We gon' look like Pacquiao, he got that white
RIchard Muir two fifty, got no diamonds in it
Bentley, it's not tinted, want you see me in it
I done fucked that many hoes at Magic City
Verizon, my money up, my wifi lit
Ain't no thinkin' twice, you know I hit the lick (Freebandz)
I don't think nobody here can stunt like this
