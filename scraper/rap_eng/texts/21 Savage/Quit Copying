[Chorus-ShawnyMoney]
Why does everyone got to copy
I'm so fresh everyone else is so sloppy
Stop wasting your time trying to stop me
Think you got a girl but she on my body (aye)
Quit tryna copy
Your bitch ass can't stop me
Stop tryna copy
Your bitch ass can't stop me
Quit tryna copy, quit tryna copy, quit tryna copy (yeah)

[Verse 1-DezzyD]
Quit tryna copy your flows are so damn sloppy
Your bitch call me papi, I'll pull up on your blocky
What you gonna do stop me
You be flexing fake brands, copy me and I'll throw my hands
I'll punch your ass in the sand
So, quit tryna copy, quit tryna copy

[Verse 2-ShawnyMoney]
Ice on my wrist I get bad bitches when I'm on the list
Oh wait, what
I got yours you must be pissed
You wanted your bitch man you must've missed
Quit tryna copy me, you're a little bitch (yeah)
Your house is nice I know 'cause I fucked your bitch twice
Louis V on my bag she say you a fag (yeah)
Cop some Air Mags

[Chorus-ShawnyMoney]
Why does everyone got to copy
I'm so fresh everyone else is so sloppy
Stop wasting your time trying to stop me
Think you got a girl but she on my body (yuh)
Quit tryna copy
Your bitch ass can't stop me
Quit tryna copy
Your bitch ass can't stop me
Quit tryna copy, quit tryna copy, quit tryna copy (yeah, quit tryna copy)

[Verse 3-DezzyD]
You think you got flow, but you can't put up a show
All you really be doing is dating hoes, I ain't tryna diss you though
Let's keep this on the low
You tried to copy me so
Quit tryna copy your flows are so damn sloppy
Your bitch call me papi, I'll pull up on your blocky
What you gonna do stop me
You be flexing fake brands, copy me and I'll throw my hands
I'll punch your ass down in the sand
So, quit tryna copy, quit tryna copy bitch
Fucking stop copying all my stuff

[Outro-ShawnyMoney]
Quit copying bitch aye
