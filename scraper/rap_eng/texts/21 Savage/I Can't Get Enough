[Intro]
I can't get enough
I-I-I-I can't get enough
I-I-I-I can't get enough
21

[Chorus]
I'm caught up in the streets, I-I-I-I can't get enough
We got soft, we got hard, we got purple, we got [?]
Got a thirty round clip, we got hundred round nuts
[?], we got semis that'll fill a nigga up
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't get enough, I-I-I-I can't get enough
We got soft, we got hard, yeah, I can't get enough
We got purple, we got [?], yeah, I can't get enough

[Verse 1]
I can't get enough, where the cash at?
AK-47 came from Baghdad
Your main bitch that's my lab rat
Supercharged Audi, I'ma crash that
21 hundred, we a smash that, blast that
For-for certain, I'm worth it
On them percocets I guess I'm perfect
Never chase a ho, I'd rather waste my time splurgin'
YSL shirts and my belt came from Herm√®s
Holocaust your clique like a young nigga German
I do this, dinner dates at [?]
Never hit the movies, I'm fuckin' in Jacuzzis
Walkin' round with Uzi, please don't make me lose it
Fifty thousand I blew that, [?] make movies

[Chorus]
I'm caught up in the streets, I-I-I-I can't get enough
We got soft, we got hard, we got purple, we got [?]
Got a thirty round clip, we got hundred round nuts
[?], we got semis that'll fill a nigga up
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't get enough, I-I-I-I can't get enough
We got soft, we got hard, yeah, I can't get enough
We got purple, we got [?], yeah, I can't get enough

[Verse 2]
21 bitch, I'm all about a check
Plus I hate hoes and I don't take no disrespect
You say you want a nine, I might just serve yo' ass some flesh
Send you to the voicemail, you pull up then you get wet
Camouflage flag, yeah we bangin' like marines
25 hundred in my True Religion jeans
I know you heard 'bout me, I sell a ho a dream
I tell her lick the Molly, then she fuck the whole team
I'm caught up in the streets, motherfuck a case
Little [?] with me, sippin' Goose, fuck a chase
Welcome to my life, long cold nights
Me and [?], we done took flight

[Chorus]
I'm caught up in the streets, I-I-I-I can't get enough
We got soft, we got hard, we got purple, we got [?]
Got a thirty round clip, we got hundred round nuts
[?], we got semis that'll fill a nigga up
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't get enough, I-I-I-I can't get enough
We got soft, we got hard, yeah, I can't get enough
We got purple, we got [?], yeah, I can't get enough

[Outro]
