[Intro: Alley Boy]

[Chorus: Alley Boy]
Somebody might get killed to this

Young nigga pull them sticks to this, ha-ha-ha
Somebody might get killed to this

Young nigga pull them sticks to this, ha-ha-ha
(Somebody might get killed to this

Young nigga pull them sticks to this, ha-ha-ha)
Damn it, it's a fish fry, it's a fish fry
Draco spittin' out big fire, spittin' out big fire

[Verse 1: Alley Boy]
Fuck them RIP shirts, fuck them T-shirts
Three shouts for the real steppers, puttin' in real work, yeah
I gotta get me a bag, bitch, I gotta keep me a bad bitch
Smoke free, drip cost a few thou', all my young niggas crashin'
On sight, we gon' smash him, I'ma let Nefew 'dem air him out
Nigga wouldn't listen, we whacked him out
Fuck all that wet, hit his granny house
Taliban shit with these choppers, nigga
How we gon' play with these type of niggas?
I'ma pull up with some real killers
Bodybag, homicide, deal with him
I'ma show them what this money do
Sendin' out ghosts like peekaboo
Blessin' them, stick with no achoo
Soon as they hop out, they start shootin'

[Chorus: Alley Boy]
Somebody might get killed to this
Somebody block get spinned to this
Young nigga pull them sticks to this, ha-ha-ha
Somebody might get killed to this
Somebody block get spinned to this
Young nigga pull them sticks to this, ha-ha
(Somebody might get killed to this
Somebody block get spinned to this
Young nigga pull them sticks to this, ha-ha-ha)
Damn it, it's a fish fry, it's a fish fry
Draco spittin' out big fire, spittin' out big fire

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I'm on Glenwood, Alley Boy in the Edge' (Edgewood)
I be on 800, where the rappers be scared (On God)
Been in so many shootouts, gotta keep one in the head (21)
And when the gang slide, we don't shoot at no legs (On God)
7.62's I carry (21)
Me and my .223 got married (On God)
When I was young nigga, used to hit licks
Go to Lenox and spend it on Bally (Straight up)
Y'all keep making these diss songs
Nigga, we don't talk, rest them niggas get buried (On God)
I come straight up out the 6
Ain't no permits, nigga, everybody carried (Keeps it)
Keep me a Glock-27 (I do)
Nigga won't catch me without it (They won't)
Lil' nigga think you hard cause you got one (So what?)
But most of my niggas got bodies (On God)
Shh, y'all niggas might tattletale, dawg, gotta keep that quiet (Lil' pussy)
On God, I'm 21 gang, if you reach for my chain then it's gon be a riot (21, 21)

[Chorus: Alley Boy]
Somebody might get killed to this
Somebody block get spinned to this
Young nigga pull them sticks to this, ha-ha-ha
Somebody might get killed to this
Somebody block get spinned to this
Young nigga pull them sticks to this, ha-ha-ha
(Somebody might get killed to this
Somebody block get spinned to this
Young nigga pull them sticks to this, ha-ha-ha)
Damn it, it's a fish fry, it's a fish fry
Draco spittin' out big fire, spittin' out big fire
