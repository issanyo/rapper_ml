[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
Man, these bitches know it, yeah, these bitches know it
They know I be poppin, they know I pop it
Yeah, these bitches know it, yeah, these bitches know it

[Verse 1: ManMan Savage]
These bitches shoot for it, I ain't going for it
This ain't going for it, and bitch, I know you know it
Ballin on the court, and I don't play no sport
I shoot m with the Coka, play the one I use for fun
Bitch, get out my kitchen, don't you see me whippin
Or on the water I'm sippin, survin cakes and pimpin
Ballin like I'm Pippin, loudness, I ain't picken
Why you stash my stash, bitch, I see you creepin
Bitch thought I was slippin, bitch, you tryna be sneeky
Don't trust none of these bitches, cause, man, these bitches be trickin
What your favorite rapper, what your favorite cooker
What your favorite bitch, she might be a capper

[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
Man, these bitches know it, yeah, these bitches know it
They know I be poppin, they know I pop it
Yeah, these bitches know it, yeah, these bitches know it

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I pop it, pocket rocket
I take a brick, chop it chop it
Bitch, I know it, you want go shopping
Real street nigga, I can't give you nothing
There go 12, I think they knockin
I'm in the boll, on the stove, got it lockin
Pussy nigga, watch it
Pull up on a nigga, got it poppin
Murder Gang, bitch, we poppin
Rolli on my wrist, tick talkin
I'm the plug, and the socket
Cook a pussy nigga, like Hibachi

[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
Man, these bitches know it, yeah, these bitches know it
They know I be poppin, they know I pop it
Yeah, these bitches know it, yeah, these bitches know it
