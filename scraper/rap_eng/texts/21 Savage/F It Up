I'm loaded the bricks on the jet
They takin' off from LAX

These bitches don't know what to expect
I'm keepin' my foot on their neck
I pull up in rari and flex
Kill him if he own me check

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I fuck up the scene
Crack in my pants and I'm drinking on lean
Glock .40 and it came with a beam
100 thousand I can't hold up my jeans
Fuck up the scene, fuck up the scene
I pull up in a brand new foreign machine
I call up the 60s they gon' get it crackin'
Bitch I'm slaughter gang, you know that I'm brackin'
Hunnid thousand bags, you know that I'm taxin'
Real stoner so I'm smokin' on wax and
Chopper on me makin' same like a breast
We move quiet nigga, call us assassins
I fucked it up, I spend the pen on the jacket
Niggas snitchin' I put ten on the aston
Street nigga fell in love with the cashin'
I don't need a stylist, I'm havin' fashion
