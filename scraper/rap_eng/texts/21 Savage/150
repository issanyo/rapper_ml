Zaytoven
Uh-huh
Paper route business fuck niggas
Yeah, yeah woah

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I'm in something foreign doin' a buck 50
She gave that pussy to a trapper now she stuck with me
If you know what I'm bout then you know what's up with me
A whole lotta pharmaceuticals and good weed
Aye, catch me in the trap where all the drugs at
With all the street niggas and the hood rats
Yeah I could fuck it up and get it right back
I'm from you ain't shit if you ain't got a sack

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
21, 21, 21
I'm in Zone 6 to Memphis, that's a lot of drug dealin'
Bitches say I'm nonchalant cause I don't got feelin's
I just went and bought a drop, it ain't got no ceilin'
You went and signed your life away cause you a broke nigga
I'm a trapper, rapper, and I'm cut throat
I get a lot of money and a lot of throat, nigga
Plus I scrape the sides up
Better not size us
Pillow talkin', Kanye West, you get your jaw wired up

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I'm in something foreign doin' a buck 50

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I just bought an orange soda and poured red in it
Might go buy a Bentley just to get some head in it
Got a trap house full of work and ain't no bed in it
Another house I take no one cause I got bread in it
Got the job done, no evidence
I'm infatuated with dead presidents
I'm smokin' big blunts, loadin' big guns
I'm with 21, here I come

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I'm in Zone 4 doin' a buck 50
She gave that pussy to a trapper now she stuck with me
If you know what I'm bout then you know what's up with me
A whole lotta pharmaceuticals and good weed
Aye, catch me in the trap where all the drugs at
With all the street niggas and the hood rats
Yeah I could fuck it up and get it right back
I'm from you ain't shit if you ain't got a sack
