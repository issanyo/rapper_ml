[Hook: Lil Duke & 21 Savage]
We some young niggas, we ain't really never had shit
If a nigga play with me, my nigga, I bet he hit black quick
Whole lotta money on me and I bet I keep a bad bitch
Coming for ya spot, yes I brought the Savage
Roll the window down and let it spray sideways
Catch a nigga slipping, hit 'em in the driveway
You better have my money, big worm, Friday
I let this motherfucker sing like it's Sade

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I let that motherfucker sing on 'em
You wanna buy that bitch a ring, don't you?
I give that bitch to the team homie
Rich nigga shit, we ain't drinking green homie
I ain't never had shit though
Young savage, I done hit a lot of kick though
I got Duke in this bitch fool
Yeah I bang red nigga but he bang blue
Chopper turn that four door to a damn coupe
Bet' not piss me [?] bitch, I'm on that damn boot
Ten four show you lead up with yo' damn boo
Nigga back-end's going through the damn roof
Last nigga tried me, left that pussy paralyzed
Rock a bye that baby, sing his ass a lullaby
I was with yo' bitch and nigga that's my alibi
You say you gangsta nigga, how the hell you testify

[Hook: Lil Duke & 21 Savage]
We some young niggas, we ain't really never had shit
If a nigga play with me, my nigga, I bet he hit black quick
Whole lotta money on me and I bet I keep a bad bitch
Coming for ya spot, yes I brought the Savage
Roll the window down and let it spray sideways
Catch a nigga slipping, hit 'em in the driveway
You better have my money, big worm, Friday
I let this motherfucker sing like it's Sade

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
Fucked a nigga bih first night, gave her lockjaw
Oh you tote a gun but ain't gon' shoot it if it pop off
Pull up in that 90, now me emergency like cop cars
Backstage at my show getting head [?]
Momma raised a savage, always knew I had it
Fucked a bitch in Magic and took her to the mattress
Gambling was a habit, mistake me with the fashion
Smoke the strongest gas [?]
These niggas act, as I'm fucking on a actress
And it's in the movie but she like it from the back
Since a young nigga I been chasing after racks
We just some young niggas, we ain't never had shit

[Hook: Lil Duke & 21 Savage]
We some young niggas, we ain't really never had shit
If a nigga play with me, my nigga, I bet he hit black quick
Whole lotta money on me and I bet I keep a bad bitch
Coming for ya spot, yes I brought the Savage
Roll the window down and let it spray sideways
Catch a nigga slipping, hit 'em in the driveway
You better have my money, big worm, Friday
I let this motherfucker sing like it's Sade
