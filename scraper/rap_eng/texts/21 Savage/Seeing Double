[Verse 1]
I’m seeing double
I’m from the gutter
My cup muddy
I’m drinking muddy
I got some niggas lost they life, I know they love me
Just ‘cause they say they love you, they don’t love you
I pour the four and then I drink it with my buddy
We got some bitches at the pad getting slutty
These niggas hating but I know these bitches love me
These niggas hating but I know these bitches love me
My cup, filled up
My blunt, it’s stuffed
Need to let that lil bitch go, you tryna cuff
I fucked her for a perc inside the club
My Glock 40 on me, hold a dub
Walking ‘round with [?], that’s a thug
I’m tryna run off on the plug
Tryna run off on the plug

[Hook]
I’m seeing double (I'm drinkin') ,seeing double ( I can't thank)
Seeing double (vision's ringin?), seeing double (oceans rain?)
I’m seeing double(pop a pill), seeing double (pop a pill)
Seeing double (how you feel?), seeing double (how I feel?)
I’m seeing double (I'm drunk), seeing double (I can't thank)
Seeing double (I can't walk), seeing double (I can't talk)
I’m seeing double (my vision's blurred), seeing double (I can't drive)
Seeing double (seeing double), seeing double (seeing double)

[Verse 2]
I popped the seal on a pint, tryna take away the heartache, yeah
Pop a Percocet just to get my head straight, yeah
We was coming up, we was selling 2 for 5
Tie your shoes up, grab a mask and then we ride
Pour me up a five and go and eat some Five Guys
Fell in love with the pharmacy, she changed my life
Tryna wash away the pain
Trapping heavy with the gang
Give a fuck ‘bout being famous
Cause most these niggas changing
Pour it in the soda and it’s changing
Whip that baking soda and go buy a range then
I’m seeing double, ‘bout to fuck a nigga’s main then
She want a street nigga with them Ben Franklin’s
