[Intro: Young Nudy]
Yo, yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?
Yeah, I'm from the middle finger
I'm from the eastside, 5
Zone 6
East Atlanta, EA
Brick city, yeah
Licks, all that shit

Sticks, all that shit
Hoes, set a nigga up, all that shit
Yeah, all that shit
In the club, beat a nigga ass, take a nigga chain, all that shit

[Chorus: Young Nudy]
I'm from the 5, middle finger zone 6
Dirty land, dirty sticks
Bad bitches gettin' hit
Put a nigga on a lick
Rob a nigga for a brick
Rob a nigga for his shit
Young nigga fall off turn into a snitch
Never turn into a bitch
Gotta' keep it cool, homie rob his ass quick
Never fallin' off, do a nigga bad, rob him for his stash, do that
Nigga talkin' like he a real gangster put a stick on his ass
Yeah, shoot that
Gotta keep that shit 100 with you, never switch on your man's
Go and get some money, gotta get some money, never hold your hand

[Verse 1: Young Nudy]
I'm the type of motherfucker, nigga never had my hand out (never nigga)
Stupid motherfucker, in my pocket nigga, know I got my cash hangin' out (50's)
Big .30 on that motherfucker, long ways know that bitch hangin' out (30's)
Bad bitch, late night, with the slime ball know she like to hang out
Middle finger with the 5, zone 6 bitch that's where I hang out (ea)
Apartments, late night, where a motherfucker like to do them shootouts (slime)
You ain't bout' what you talkin' bout', you can't hang out (hang out)

Lame ass nigga, (lame ass nigga) wanna be street nigga, sweet ass nigga, (sweet ass nigga) put on the plate eat nigga, you ain't bout it nigga, (you ain't bout it nigga) been in the street
For how long slime?
Since I was like 13 nigga

[Chorus: Young Nudy]
I'm from the 5, middle finger zone 6
Dirty land, dirty sticks
Bad bitches gettin' hit
Put a nigga on a lick
Rob a nigga for a brick
Rob a nigga for his shit
Young nigga fall off turn into a snitch
Never turn into a bitch
Gotta' keep it cool, homie rob his ass quick
Never fallin' off, do a nigga bad, rob him for his stash, do that
Nigga talkin' like he a real gangster put a stick on his ass
Yeah, shoot that
Gotta keep that shit 100 with you, never switch I'm the man's

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Middle finger with the 5 (6)

Shoot a nigga in his spine (spine)
Nigga's snitch to cut time (21)

Back it up, back it up, .223 gon' make a nigga back it up (21)
Tryna' strip a nigga, gotta' change my outfit, nigga it ain't black enough (ya digg)

[Chorus: Young Nudy]
