[Intro: No Plug]
Yeah nigga
No Plug
Average ass bitches man
I ain't fuckin' you unless you got a million followers on Instagram hoe

[Hook: No Plug] (2x)
Your chain got you embarrassed
My earring like three carats
This Louis chain from Paris

No Plug a savage bitch
Your bitch just an average bitch
No Plug a savage bitch
Your bitch just an average bitch

[Verse 1: No Plug]
Now diamonds on my doin' a holla
Bitch I used to sleep on blow ups

Boy your money need to grow up
I read up nigga show me no love

Bottle of 4 88 of a one play
Got that draco in that passenger
Chevy just came home he goin' clap at ya
Her outfit came from Pink I told her back it up
Packs came in back it up
Racks came in stack it up
This a Bentley not a Acura
I got Moncler on my coat it keep me warm
I got real shooters lil nigga they're swore
I don't make diss songs nigga I send warnings
Droped a song last night he was dead in the morning

[Hook: No Plug] (2x)
Your chain got you embarrassed
My earring like three carats
This Louis chain from Paris
Bitch I'm livin' lavish
No Plug a savage bitch
