[Verse 1: Loso Loaded]
Pull up on you, make that motherfucka spray
100 thousand, make that shit in a day
Ain't flexin' nigga, I'm havin' my way
Roll the window down and shoot with the K
50 thousand show the fuck where you stay
Mocha gonna hit that boy in the face
Nigga keep talkin', yeah nigga keep talkin'
Till 'em new dark extensions get to clappin'

[Hook: Loso Loaded]
Extortion, extortion

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
All type of fuckery
Loso Loaded, Savage, keep 'em my blood
223'll put a hole in your motor
Hit him in the stomach, bet he gon' throw up
Murder Gang, give a fuck what you throw up
Diamonds dancin came from whippin up cola
Draco on me make your ass do the hold up
9th ward, PDE got the soda
21, tint so dark I'm in the Batcave
40 sent a nigga that way
Put a nigga bitch on Backpage
SG, nigga PDE, MP the real street
Snatchin' chains, snatchin' pockets
Pistol poppin', nigga don't want no beef

[Verse 3: Loso Loaded]
Man down
I never stand down
Gualla in the briefcase, I just won a sweepstakes
Extortin' pussy niggas out they gulla through the weekday
Ridin' in a 10 speed in that muthafuckin' V10
Extortin' pussy niggas outta anythin' nigga we ain't ever been friends
I want ends, I want the cash, nigga stackin' up the Legos
Stick in the backseat in this whip and brought a peso
And there more where that came from, we got ARs and 'em DRACO
I don't fuck with hay, hoe, vacayin' in the Bay, hoe
I'm rockin' these different jewels, they got me in different moves
My youngin' do what I say, told 'em get on the pedestal
