[Intro: Yo Gotti]
It go Murda on the beats, boy

[Refrain: Yo Gotti]
It go Murda on the beats, boy
Yeah it's murder on these streets, boy
Murdered the pussy, I'm a beast boy
And you a soldier, I'm a G boy

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Semi-auto with no recoil
Forgiatos, they on fleek boy
Twenty murders in a week boy
I'm from the murder capital, no sleep boy
I'm a rapper but I'm different, I ain't tryna say I'm tough
Keep that pistol every day and don't you ever call my bluff
I live my whole life criminal, keep talking to a minimal
My nigga catch a case, I'm fightin' it with them 'til they sentence 'em (real shit)
And it's still fuck the DA and the judge (real shit)
Biggest gangster, and ain't a crip or a blood (real shit)
Fuck a label when you got it out the mud (CMG the label)
All these sensitive ass rappers need hugs
I ain't grow up with you, I don't know you nigga
Quit hittin' my phone 'bout that verse, look I don't owe you, nigga
I ain't beefin' on no Twitter, I be go on a niggas
I'ma make you be a gangster, bring the ho out niggas
I'm bumpin' slaughter gang, 21, back when I was 21
Drive-bys, homicides, switching sides, you were done
How we in the shootout four deep and I'm the only one
With an empty drum, where I'm from that'll get you hung
Murder rate, murder rate
Was ducking the DA, now I'm at the VMAs (look at me)
Killin' shit, yellow tape (yellow tape)
They don't wanna see a nigga elevate (anyway)
They tryna really really trick me off the streets
They tryna give me a murder case
All these lil fuck niggas irritate
Shoot one these niggas, don't hesitate

[Chorus: Yo Gotti & 21 Savage]
It go murder she wrote (21)
I'ma murder the dope (yeah)
Yeah I be killin' 'em
I'm gon' murder the kitchen (whip)
I'ma murder the chickens (murder)
Yeah I be killin' em

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I got murder for a fee nigga (21)
I got murder for the cheap nigga (21)
Catch you in Miami, gun you down on the beach nigga (facts)
Just 'cause I'm a rapper don't you ever think it's sweet nigga (yeah)
I was slangin' choppers 'fore I ever rapped on beats nigga
Fox 5, bitch boy that's what I claim (21)
Rappers scared to hang around me 'cause they know they lame (god)
Beat a double homicide 'fore I bought a chain (nah for real)
I went and bought a Bentley truck, I did not buy a Range (21)
You put a ring around that bitch, she known for giving brain (stupid)
Never had security, ain't a nigga touch my chain (on god)
I keep a Glock forty, one on top, and that's on god (gang)
Since I was a youngin, OG's told me I got hard (gang)
Yeah I got hard ho, pull your card ho, yeah yeah
Red light shots make you park ho, yeah yeah
Stamped and approved, this ain't no 'flauge ho, yeah ho
You niggas talk too much, you act like broads ho (you act like bitches)

[Refrain: Yo Gotti]
It go Murda on the beats, boy
Yeah it's murder on these streets, boy
Twenty murders in a week boy (well damn)
I'm from the murder capital, no sleep boy

[Chorus: Yo Gotti & 21 Savage]
It go murder she wrote (21)
I'ma murder the dope (yeah)
Yeah I be killin' 'em
I'm gon' murder the kitchen (whip)
I'ma murder the chickens (murder)
Yeah I be killin' em

[Refrain: Yo Gotti]
It go Murda on the beats, boy
Yeah it's murder on these streets, boy
Murdered the pussy, I'm a beast boy
And you a soldier, I'm a G boy
