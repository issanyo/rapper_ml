[Verse: 21 Savage]
10 bad bitches in a mansion
Wrist on Milly Rock them diamonds on me dancin'
When you workin' hard then your money start expandin'
I got model bitches wanna lick me like some candy
And them drugs come in handy
Last name Savage bitch, but no I'm not Randy
Hit her with no condom, had to make her eat a plan B
And I'm sippin' on that Codeine, not Brandy

[Hook: 21 Savage]
I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch
I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch
Hold up, I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch
Hold up, I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch
Fuck a wedding ring, I bought a necklace
Diamonds got the flu, try not to catch this
I left that hoe alone 'cause she was ratchet (21)

[Hook 2: 21 Savage]
I'm just flexin on my ex-bitch
I'm just stuntin on my ex bitch

[Outro: 21 Savage]
I left that hoe alone 'cause she was ratchet (21)
I left that hoe alone 'cause she was ratchet (21)
I left that hoe alone 'cause she was ratchet (21)
I left that hoe alone 'cause she was ratchet (21)
I left that hoe alone 'cause she was ratchet (21)
I left that hoe alone 'cause she was ratchet (21)
