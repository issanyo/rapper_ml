Hang with nothing but them Savages
All my niggas they be having this
Long clip, them extendos
Play your ass like Nintendo, blowing gas out the window
Getting brain from your main bitch, you know a young nigga getting rich
But I still slap me a hoe, and I still kick me a door
Making her get on the floor, put the pump in her mouth and give up the dough
Young nigga 'o finna club, with all of my dogs

Got your girl, she show me love
Cuz she know I'm a bad guy, she know what's up
