[Verse 1]
Every day that I'm alive, I’ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain’t no way I'ma switch

[Interlude]
Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down

[Verse 2]
Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

[Chorus]
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)
Left you out to rot? (A lot)
How many pray that you flop? (A lot)
How many lawyers you got? (A lot)
How many times you got shot? (A lot)
How many niggas you shot? (A lot)
How many times did you ride? (A lot)
How many niggas done died? (A lot)
How many times did you cheat? (A lot)
How many times did you lie? (A lot)
How many times did she leave? (A lot)
How many times did she cry? (A lot)
How many chances she done gave you?
Fuck around with these thots (A lot)

[Verse 3]
Take a dive, put away my pride ('Way my pride)
Shoot my shot, DMJ I slide (Yeah, I slide)
She in front, but she used to be my side (Be my side)
We take selfies now I used to in her live (In her live)
Before the fame, Plan B was robbin' banks (Robbin' banks)
Being married man, right now I just can't (I just can't)
All the love they gave me knew that it was fake (It was fake)
Mama love me so much, either way I'm straight (Way I’m straight)
I done seen so many handshakes turn to hate
Seen so many BF’s turn [?] (Turn to snakes)
Death before designer tatted on my face
Way I run the check up, should've been with Chase (Been with Chase)
Start at the bottom, the trenches, the gutters
So I had to go lil harder (Straight up)
Lights was out, the gas was off so we had to boil up the water (Straight up)
Went through some things, but I couldn’t imagine my kids stuck at the border (Straight up)
Flint still need water (Straight up), niggas was innocent couldn't get lawyers (On god)

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)
Left you out to rot? (A lot)
How many pray that you flop? (A lot)
How many lawyers you got? (A lot)
How many times you got shot? (A lot)
How many niggas you shot? (A lot)
How many times did you ride? (A lot)
How many niggas done died? (A lot)
How many times did you cheat? (A lot)
How many times did you lie? (A lot)
How many times did she leave? (A lot)
How many times did she cry? (A lot)
How many chances she done gave you?
Fuck around with these thots (A lot)
