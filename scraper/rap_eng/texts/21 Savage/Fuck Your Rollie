[Hook]
Fuck yo' lil rollie
Fuck yo' lil rollie
Fuck yo' lil rollie
Red diamonds they on me
Yo main bitch is on me
She ride me like ponies
That rollie is on me, you know that its stolen
My young niggas see it, they runnin' up on it

[Bridge]
I'm havin' it on me
I'm havin' it on me
I'm havin' it on me
I'm havin' it on me
I'm havin' it on me
I'm havin' it on me
I'm havin' it on me

[Verse]
I'm havin' it on me, I just took a rollie
I pull up in Phantoms, that carbon it's on me
You niggas be fakin' you niggas is phony
You niggas is fool, you niggas is baloney
Shoot you like a bitch, Pull up with a stick
Pull up on ya bitch, make her eat the dick
Glock 40 full clip, comin' out the hip
I'm comin' out the rip, I'm makin' niggas strip
I'm 21 gang, you niggas is lame
I be with BG, they keepin' that flame
All my killers trained, point blank range, hit 'em in the face
Cold casket nigga, fuck a case
Bitch you thirsty, bitch you nasty
See my diamonds, called me handsome
Four inside the fanta, I got white like Santa
Playin' with my money meet the MC Hammer

[Hook]
Fuck yo' lil rollie
Fuck yo' lil rollie
Fuck yo' lil rollie
Red diamonds they on me
Yo main bitch is on me
She ride me like ponies
That rollie is on me, you know that its stolen
My young niggas see it, they runnin' up on it
