Why you mad?
This lil bitch gon' give me top because I rap
She tried to fuck me cause there's ice around my neck
Fuck up OUT my face lil bitch before I snap

[ 21 Savage]

Why you mad?
Every single pocket, nigga I got cash
21 Savage rubberband on racks
Got 100,000 dollars in my attic
I got gas comin' in through the mail
So much weed, I damn near broke the scale
When Slaughter Gang pull up, nigga call 12
All these bricks, they think I'm with the cartel

[Lil West]

All this rap
Rick Owens and Supreme, I'm popping tags
I wear Mason, throw like 50 in the trash
She my Louie Balenciaga on the bags
Red juice, red gas
Got my white boys shootin', call them Nash
I got bitches in my crib, they poppin' Zans
Niggas said they need a feature, I need bands
Pussy nigga I need bands
