[Intro]
Niggas tryna clone me, tryna make another me, aye
Niggas tryna clone me, tryna make another me, whoa-whoa
You blowing up her phone and she still sucking me, whoa-whoa
You a sucka, sucka


[Verse 1]
I be on slump shit, nigga, I hang in the slumps
I heard shawty got that dope from that [?]
Niggas getting spoofed, getting fooled out that profit
Bitch see my Instagram and she think a nigga popping
Young Savage, bitch, if you ain't fucking, switch the topic

[Hook]
I go foo-foo, I go coo-coo
Got the juice, juice, nigga, who you?
Pick a side, side, nigga, choose, choose
Count a hundred racks in my new school

[Verse 2]
Bitch niggas spend a hundred on a bitch, nigga
Bust down, spend a hundred on my wrist, nigga
Fuck them pussies, spend a hundred on a hit, nigga
Hundred busting out my pocket, won't fit, nigga
So much money in my pocket, it won't fit, whoa
Asked about you round the town and you a freak ho
I be thumbing through that shit with my eyes closed
Let me get behind that shell till your spine gone
So much coke, I got these bitches want to steal
So much soap, just got a warrant, the police
Niggas really thought shit was sweet
Niggas really wanna [?] me
Chopper bust a nigga wave cap way back
She blowing up my phone, I hate that, hate that
I love it when she getting naked, naked
I started from the bottom, patience, patience

[Hook]
I go foo-foo, I go coo-coo
Got the juice, juice, nigga, who you?
Pick a side, side, nigga, choose, choose
Count a hundred racks in my new school

[Outro]
Bitch niggas spend a hundred on a bitch, nigga
Bust down, spend a hundred on my wrist, nigga
Fuck them pussies, spend a hundred on a hit, nigga
Hundred busting out my pocket, won't fit, nigga
So much money in my pocket, it won't fit, whoa
Asked about you round the town and you a freak ho
I be thumbing through that shit with my eyes closed
Let me get behind that shell till your spine gone
