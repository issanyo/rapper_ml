[Intro: 21 Savage]
You see this chain around my neck nigga
You see this chain around my neck nigga
You see this chain around my neck nigga

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
You see this chain around my neck nigga
I'm probably gon' die for that shit
She know a nigga a dog
I'm probably gon' lie to that bitch
You niggas know I'm gang
That shit ain't gon' slide in the six
Audemar Piguet wet nigga
Fuck that sneak dissin', nigga I'm pushin' up
Make a nigga whole hood run and duck
I'd be mad too if I was broke as fuck
Ain't no gang gang, you niggas street punks, woah

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Grab that heckler on that bitch, hold up, 21
Smith and Wesson on that bitch, hold up
You niggas stressin' 'bout that shit, 21
God keep blessin' me and shit, 21
Woah woah, scoop a nigga main ho ho
21, make her hit the road, four-four
Cuffin' thotties, that's a no no
We pass 'em 'round, nigga pass 'em 'round
How you gon' be gangster nigga and a clown
I'm swimmin' in your bitch, I think I'm 'bout to drown
Hundred round drum on that shit nigga, flip
I got a lot of bullets for that motherfuckin' lip
VVS's drippin', lil nigga watch it drip
You try to touch my chain, them boys gon' kill you off the rip
Last pussy nigga tried me got killed
Ain't no pump faking, every magazine filled nigga
I'ma hit something if I pull it off the hip nigga
Your bitch in the [?], bendin' over, gettin' drilled nigga
Behave nigga, sour like some motherfuckin' milk nigga
In me, it ain't on me, this the way I was built nigga

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
You see this chain around my neck nigga
I'm probably gon' die for that shit
She know a nigga a dog
I'm probably gon' lie to that bitch
You niggas know I'm gang
That shit ain't gon' slide in the six
Audemar Piguet wet nigga
Fuck that sneak dissin', nigga I'm pushin' up
Make a nigga whole hood run and duck
I'd be mad too if I was broke as fuck
Ain't no gang gang, you niggas street punks

[Verse 2: Big 36oz]
Playin' with them birds like it's mid, yeah
Drop top, shoot up your block
Shootin' so scary and so wild
Pray to god I don't hit no child
You know how we gon' approach a lil boss nigga
We gon' go straight at his shooters
Knock out and neuter, thirty clip on me, not down to go elephant
We shootin' shit out a four door, come try this shit
Drunk off the Henny, I fuck around punk your bitch
They copy the swag, the sauce, the juice
And you let me notice it
Damn lil nigga, you still sippin'?
Damn lil bitch, you know I'm still drippin'
I'm 36 Oz, I'm hard as your house bricks
Want [?] an opp, I pull up and spark the bitch

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
You see this chain around my neck nigga
I'm probably gon' die for that shit
She know a nigga a dog
I'm probably gon' lie to that bitch
You niggas know I'm gang
That shit ain't gon' slide in the six
Audemar Piguet wet nigga
Fuck that sneak dissin', nigga I'm pushin' up
Make a nigga whole hood run and duck
I'd be mad too if I was broke as fuck
Ain't no gang gang, you niggas street punks
