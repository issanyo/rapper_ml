[Verse 1]
I can tell these nigga's scared the way they talk
Gold pyrex, I put diamonds on my fork
Pull up on your block, white chalk
Chopper bullets skate, Tony Hawk
I'ma cut your fingers off if you shout
Pop a perc, hit the cup, nigga pause
Hundred round drum, round of applause
Bitches know I got that bag, Santa Claus
I drink lean and I pop Xans
Slaughter Gang, we the Glock clan
Poppin' molly nigga, San-Tan
I'm back on that bullshit again
I wanna fuck your best friend
I just went a bought a brand new Benz
Bitch I came from the bottom
We was starving, we was robbing

[Hook]
Mind your business, bitch
Mind your business, bitch
Mind your business, bitch
Mind your business, bitch
We ain't with that friendly shit
That friendly shit
That friendly shit
That friendly shit
Catch 'em out back, roll the window down and smash
Another toe-tagged nigga laying in the grass

[Verse 2]
Five shooters in the back of the Uber nigga and they ready to shoot
I tie my laces, I dip in that bag nigga and I take me a blue
I'm the Slaughter King nigga, I don't give a fuck about you
You get you some money, you get you some fame, these bitches gon' come out the blue
Bullet holes in my body, paranoid I'ma pop it
If you snitchin' I'ma pop it, wrong move, I'ma drop it
.15 in my sock, trappin' at the bus stop
Came from a nickel rock, now I got a whole block

[Hook]
Mind your business, bitch
Mind your business, bitch
Mind your business, bitch
Mind your business, bitch
We ain't with that friendly shit
That friendly shit
That friendly shit
That friendly shit
Catch 'em out back, roll the window down and smash
Another toe-tagged nigga laying in the grass
