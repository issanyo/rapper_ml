[Intro]
Whoa
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 1]
You runnin' 'round drinkin' liquor
Takin' pictures 'cause you miss me
(I know you miss me)
You runnin' 'round drinkin' liquor
Fuckin' niggas 'cause you miss me
(You just want attention)
You can sleep with half the world
Bet you still won't forget me
(On God)
You could find love, get married, have kids
I'd still be realest nigga to hit it
(Straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up)
I was gettin' some head earlier and you crossed my mind (Straight up)
I'm as solid as they come, but you crossed the line (21)
Yeah, you best start keepin' it real, I can see the signs (On God)
When it came to havin' your back, I'm so real
I prolly would've gave you my spine (Straight up)
I'd rather have loyalty than love
'Cause love really don't mean jack (Straight up)
See love is just a feeling
You can love somebody and still stab them in the back (Oh God)
It don't take much to love
You can love somebody just by being attached (21)
See loyalty is a action
You can love or hate me and still have my back (Facts)

[Chorus]
I gave you my all (My all)
You was my dawg (You was my dawg)
I would have went to war with the world on your call (On your call)
Thought you had my back (Nah)
You let me fall (Let me fall)
You healed my pain (My pain)
Then you caused it (Then you caused it)
Now I gotta ball without you (Straight up)
Now I gotta ball (Straight up)
Now I gotta ball without you (21)
Now I gotta ball (21)
Now I gotta ball without you (Pow)
Now I gotta ball (Now I gotta ball)
Now I gotta ball without you (21)
Now I gotta ball (21, 21)

[Verse 2]
You crossed me once, it's fuck you forever (Straight up)
Middle school got my heart broke, stop writin' love letters (21)
Heart cold, yeah, so cold had to buy the Moncler sweater (Oh God)
Valentines Day, she ripped the card and urinated on the rose petals (Damn)
You was my rock, heavy metal
Now you ain't shit to me (Facts)
I thought it was love, until I woke up
And had an epiphany (21)
Keep the fame and keep the love
Just give me the loyalty (On God)
Nefertiti, King Tut
I treat you like royalty (Fact)

[Bridge]
I just wish your love wouldn't fade away
Even when the smoke clear, I'm here to stay
Don't you ever let a nigga take my place
Would you be around if I had minimum wage?

[Chorus]
I gave you my all (My all)
You was my dawg (You was my dawg)
I would have went to war with the world on your call (On your call)
Thought you had my back (Nah)
You let me fall (Let me fall)
You healed my pain (My pain)
Then you caused it (Then you caused it)
Now I gotta ball without you (Straight up)
Now I gotta ball (Straight up)
Now I gotta ball without you (21)
Now I gotta ball (21)
Now I gotta ball without you (Pow)
Now I gotta ball (Now I gotta ball)
Now I gotta ball without you (21)
Now I gotta ball (21, 21)
