[Chorus]
1-0 raps in my backpack, nigga
I had a strap in my backpack, nigga (on my mama, nigga)
Had that crack in my backpack, nigga
Murder gang nigga, blatt blatt

[Verse]
I listened to your tape and it was wack
...
I could make a porno out my snapchats, nigga, nigga
Fuck you mean, nigga?
Thousand dollar jeans, nigga, nigga (jeans, nigga)
I don't drink green, nigga, nigga (that's for broke niggas)
We drankin' real lean, nigga, nigga, nigga
Fuck you mean, nigga?
All that jewelry, made 'em tuck that

[Chorus]
1-0 raps in my backpack, nigga
I had a strap in my backpack, nigga (on my mama, nigga)
Had that crack in my backpack, nigga
Murder gang nigga, blatt blatt
