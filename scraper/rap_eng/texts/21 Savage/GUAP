[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Better duck from the shells
Break her back just like kale, you niggas gon' tell
After 11, I jump to a teen cause I do not fuck with 12
I do not get it you niggas and bitches
Leave his ass with stitches if he touch my digits
Pull up to the scene, all you hear is crickets
Buddy went ghost when he saw we wit it
I'm richer now, make a phone call and he'll get you now
Lock down with the same family
Cause all these new niggas be switch arounds
It's Lil Boat, fresher than Scope, gold on my throat
I pledge an oath to stay on my toes, to stay down with my bros
I keep a round, anything that my nigga want he can get it (lil boat)
Cause if I call up my nigga, bet that he let you get it, loyalty
King of the Teens and royalty
Just saw your new grill, look like foil, B
Young nigga rich, fuckin' up a sack, fuckin' on your bitch

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I get that money and spend it
I'm in a Rari, it's tinted
I fucked his bitch now he trippin'
Bitch my name Bin and I ain't in it
I got a way with the women
I got a way with the hoes
I spend my money on money
You spend your money on clothes
I broke my arm in the bowl
And I get 20 a show
I got my diamonds from L.A
I spent a check on that Rolls
I spent the check on her purse
Then I went bought me a vert
Scrapin' the bowl then I skrrt
I'm scrapin' the bowl then I skrrt
I'm ridin' 'round the city with a stick
Make this muthfucka fishtail
I get surgical with the pump
Nigga call me Denzel, Training Day
I just might hop on the plane today
My jewelry on, but I'm plain today
Money on me, it might rain today
Give a fuck 'bout what these haters say
Bitch I'm gon' get it
Got a friend with a friend, bitches come wit it
Nut all on her titties, bitches gettin' freaky
These niggas wanna be me, bitch I ball like Bibby
