Keep a whole lotta hundreds
Keep a whole lotta gunners
Slaughter gang top 5 crew, nigga pull up spraying out of rentals
Young Savage real street nigga and you know a nigga rep that murder
And I'm solid as a motherfucker, young shell, nigga no turtle
Whole lotta hundreds and they blue
Whole lotta sticks and they new
Nigga what you gonna do
When we got them choppers pointed at you
Pull up nigga, send some shots at your boo
Baby mama with you, she get it too
Zone 6 niggas know how to shoot
Mally Mall, these nigga pass me the booth

Yeah young nigga pass me the scale
Young Savage and I run off with bails

Blue hundreds, nigga keep me some bail money

Since a younging I was hustling
I'm a young boss nigga, if it ain't about the blues, it ain't about nothing
