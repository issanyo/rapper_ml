[Intro: 21 Savage]
21, 21, 21 21 21
I'm from out the gutter, middle finger, Zone 6
Turned 16 and I got my first stick
Fuck the other side, catch a body, sending hits (21)
You call that shit extended clip, we call that bitch a dick (21)

[Chorus 1: 21 Savage & Offset]
Bitch I'm mad balling, all my diamonds mad flawless
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious
I got mad dick, turning these hoes into mad stalkers (21)
I got mad dick, turning these hoes into mad stalkers (woo, woo, woo, woo)

Stand on the stove, cook it all up (cook it up)
Trap on the north with the gualas (Migos)
