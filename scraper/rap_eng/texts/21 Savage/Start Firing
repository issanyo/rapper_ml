[Bridge: 21 Savage]
Imma start firing firing firing but
If a nigga try me
Imma start firing firing firing

[Hook: 21 Savage]
Wish I can turn back time
Hit pause and press rewind
Feel like all the real niggas dyin'
Lord forgive me cuz I'm tryin' but
If a nigga try me
Imma start firing
Tell my shooter grab the choppa
Nigga start firing
If a nigga try me
Imma start firing
Tell my shooter grab the choppa
Nigga start firing

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
What the fuck you 'pose to do
When yo stomach keep talkin'
Lil sister need school clothes
You clutchin' on yo forty
Voices in my head
I can't seem to to get 'em off
One sayin' stay loyal
Other tellin' me to cross 'em
Everybody say they bosses but
They really all for self
Got me thinkin' to myself
Ain't no real niggas left
Cuz all the real niggas left
They either dead or down the road
Niggas goin' out bad
They'll kill you bout a ho
Man these streets so cold, so cold
I swear these streets so cold, so cold
I pray to god that he watch my soul
And let me know whose a friend or a foe

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
RIP to Johnny B
He died right in front of me
He was sittin' in the driver seat
I was sittin' in that passenger seat
Lil Larry got shot
Man my nigga Crucial too
Got me wonderin' in the streets Like
What i'm 'pose to do Like
Who i'm 'pose to trust Like
Who i'm 'pose to fuck Like
This bitch set me up Like
Imma wet her up
They gave my right hand man life
Nigga I got real stripes
I remember cold nights
TJ lost his whole life
I can't take no mo of life
But I can't let go of life
6 shots i made it out alive it's 21 for life
