[Intro]
If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm boomin' (I'm boomin')
And she boomin' (And she boomin')
And he boomin' (And he boomin')
And we boomin', keep it boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin' (21)

[Chorus]
Trap still boomin'
Phone still boomin'
All these plays, man
A nigga still boomin' (21)
I'm boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', I'm boomin'

[Verse 1]
I prayed for this
You get a whole lot hate with this
I keep a 'K and I'm ready to spray for this
I'm ready to spray for this
If them drugs ain't in my system I can't function right
She got a fat ass but she got cellulite
I'm too trill, nigga, I can't even tell no lie
You a street punk, you ain't killed nobody
Niggas say they real, but they don't keep it a hundred
That is not real
And I'm pourin' up that mud, like a oil spill
And she don't wanna fuck, but I bet her friend will
Or her sister will, bitch I keep that steel
And I'm 'bout my money
Yeah, I love that money
And I love my family and I love my bros
And I'm Slaughter Gang
I don't love these hoes

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm boomin' (I'm boomin')
And she boomin' (And she boomin')
And he boomin' (And he boomin')
And we boomin', keep it boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin' (21)

[Chorus]
Trap still boomin'
Phone still boomin'
All these plays, man
A nigga still boomin' (21)
I'm boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', I'm boomin'

[Interlude]
Metro...
Metro, Savage
Trap (boomin')
The Glock (boomin')
Slaughter Gang (boomin')
PDE (boomin')
Everybody (boomin')
Everybody (boomin')
Ya dig?

[Verse 2]
We got 'K's on us, and everybody shootin'
Drops some pills on this table, all these bitches chewin' (chewin')
Slam dunkin' in her mouth, I feel like Patrick Ewing (21)
Fuck these bitches, money the only thing I'm purusin'
Check chase, fake friends
Had to cut 'em off and keep it movin' (bitch)
'Cause niggas ain't loyal (21)
The stick ain't loyal
Shoot a nigga, call my lawyer (call my lawyer)
I might knock a nigga out, just call me De la Hoya (ya dig)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm boomin' (I'm boomin')
And she boomin' (And she boomin')
And he boomin' (And he boomin')
And we boomin', keep it boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin' (21)

[Chorus]
Trap still boomin'
Phone still boomin'
All these plays, man
A nigga still boomin' (21)
I'm boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', boomin'
Boomin', I'm boomin'
