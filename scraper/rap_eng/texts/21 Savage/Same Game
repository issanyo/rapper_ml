[Verse 1: Golde]
Got you couple grams, told 'em bring it to the bar
Mother fuck a section
We good right here where we are
It's just me and my compadres and we only make deposits
I remember when we didn't have no money, now we popping
And she bustin' on my wallet, cause she came for the money
Rubber bands on these hunnids
Now she want take it from me so I...
Told her do it if she ready
Campaign on her belly
Money falling like confetti

[Chorus]
I... Told her bend it over
Get to work because it's tipping time
She said she ain't into mind games, it's money on her mind
So we obviously believe in the same thing
Obviously be playing the same game
Then she let go and get to twerking
Move that body, cause it's tipping time
I wanna take you home and love but just for tonight
So we obviously believe in the same thing
Obviously be playing the same game


[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
We playing the same game (Yeah)
Shorty keep poppin' up at the square
Like she my main thing (21, 21)
Married to the street, yeah the concrete a wedding ring
She climb the pole then pop lock it, drop it
Ride the dick like a Kawasaki
Rolly, Rolly, we got matching watches
I bought my bitch a new drop top
I put Chanel on her purse
She stiff on me nigga, no flirt
I love when she wear no panties
Bend her over, hit her through the skirt
She know a nigga out here work
She know if she cheat Imma hurt

[Chorus]
I... Told her bend it over
Get to work because it's tipping time
She said she ain't into mind games, it's money on her mind
So we obviously believe in the same thing
Obviously be playing the same game
Then she let go and get to twerking
Move that body, cause it's tipping time
I wanna take you home and love but just for tonight
So we obviously believe in the same thing
Obviously be playing the same game

[Verse 3: Golde]
Tell me what you feel, baby I'll make you a star
Do it in the spotlight, baby you'll go very far
Damn you know you got it baby, you know you the one
And I just want to see you take it all off if you fucking with it
She shake it she got plenty
Told her drop and give me 50
Told her drop and give me 50
And I'm gassed out like the Texico
I'm rolling through the city
Benjis stacked up on the table
So you know she fucking with me

[Chorus]
I... Told her bend it over
Get to work because it's tipping time
She said she ain't into mind games, it's money on her mind
So we obviously believe in the same thing
Obviously be playing the same game
Then she let go and get to twerking
Move that body, cause it's tipping time
I wanna take you home and love but just for tonight
So we obviously believe in the same thing
Obviously be playing the same game
