[Verse]
Wash away the pain with the soda
Tryna make the work double up, I beat the bowl up
Tryna make the work double up to meet my quota
.40 on my hip, you know that chopper on my shoulder
I remember hard times when it was no love
I remember fast money and them slow bucks
I got all this gold on me like the gold rush
VVS's drippin' on me , get your hoe took
I remember shoot outs niggas, broad day
Remember when I hit that nigga with the K
Niggas ain't loyal, nigga they'll betray you
Shoot 'em in the temple, give that nigga a fade
My dog got life and shit ain't been the same
All I got is money bags on my brain
Go hard in the booth and buy another chain
I do it for the money nigga, not the fame
