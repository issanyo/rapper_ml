Am I my brother's keeper? Nino Brown
100,000 off a beeper, Nino Brown
I can't believe that my homie was a rat, Nino Brown
And my dopeman still smokin' crack, Nino Brown
50 bricks in the projects, Nino Brown
50 broad day in apartments, Nino Brown
I'mma take over the whole city, Nino Brown
I'mma run me up a whole milli', Nino Brown

[Verse 1]
21 Savage, I feel like Nino
In aparments, shootin' Cee-lo
Got lil hair with me, and 3 kilos
Finna remix a nigga at the stove
I feel like Nino in the carter sellin' dope
Only differents nigga I'm on that glint Monroe
Splashing with the water when it leave the stove
When it lock up, that mean I struck gold
I feel like Nino (yes I do)
I feel like Nino (yes I do, nigga)
All this damn money got me feelin' like Nino
All this damn money got me feelin' like Nino
21!

[Verse 2]
I need a rockin' bod baby like Keisha
Down bitch don't check you with a nina
She gave me loyalty, I gave that bitch a Beamer
She gave me more, I put a quarter on her finger
These niggas workin' with reinforcements like G Money
But you can't break my operation, I'm gettin' money
I got a 100 round drum my choppa gunnin'
(?) snitched on me they (?)
Fuck the fame nigga
Bitch switch she get dro in champagne, nigga
Rottweiler off the leash, I'm off the chain, nigga
This the life when you sellin' cocaine, nigga
