[Intro]
JYork, whoa, thank you sir

[Chorus: VL Deck]
All this money comin' fast, I can't find nowhere to stash it
Lil mama ass fat, huh, I can't wait to smash it
Chokers on my neck boy, yeah I'm rockin' carats
You can throw it in the bag, bitch I think I'm Fabolous
All this shit came off of gas, never seen advance check
I just sent like thirty bags down to the projects
I got one, two, three, four shooters clutchin' carbons

[Verse 1: VL Deck]
I got bad bitches and they ass fat
Rock designer bags and they shoes match
They whole squad pretty, all y'all can get it
They on Live with it, they hashtag litty
We on the sofa, poppin' bottles, I just capped for fifty
Paparazzi snappin' pictures, everybody lookin'
Gold bottles everywhere, this is a motion movie
Fuck work, bitch said it's goin' up on Tuesday
Parkin' lot, I killed them, I left the top roofless
Boss bitch with me named Cookie so I'm Lucious
Forty shots, no handgun, I'm shootin' a baby Uzi
220 on the dash, I hit the gas, I bet I lose 'em

[Chorus: VL Deck]
All this money comin' fast, I can't find nowhere to stash it
Lil mama ass fat, huh, I can't wait to smash it
Chokers on my neck boy, yeah I'm rockin' carats
You can throw it in the bag, bitch I think I'm Fabolous
All this shit came off of gas, never seen advance check
I just sent like thirty bags down to the projects
I got one, two, three, four shooters clutchin' carbons

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I don't need burglar bars, German Shephards in my yard
Merry Christmas, Happy New Years, I bought choppers for the squad
I been robbin' since a youngin, I put trackers on your Dodge
You a rapper, I'm a clapper, Put a hundred in your Ford
I got one, two, three, four M's in my bank account
Five, six, seven, eight niggas ready to shake you down
I ain't with the fake shit, fake dap, fake pics
AR with the scope, I give your pussy ass a face lift
Moncler jacket cost a thirty, I ain't cappin'
Army fatigue boots two thousand, I ain't cappin' (a bag)
I ain't talkin' clothes, lil nigga I'm talkin' trappin' (no swag)
Ask around the city, everybody know that we 'bout action (21, 21)

[Chorus: VL Deck]
All this money comin' fast, I can't find nowhere to stash it
Lil mama ass fat, huh, I can't wait to smash it
Chokers on my neck boy, yeah I'm rockin' carats
You can throw it in the bag, bitch I think I'm Fabolous
All this shit came off of gas, never seen advance check
I just sent like thirty bags down to the projects
I got one, two, three four shooters clutchin' carbons

[Verse 3: VL Desk]
I'm in the brackets by myself, yeah, I'm forever servin'
Prophet to the trap, some call me the eight sermon
I be where it's bite and slash scary, but I'm never nervous
Horses in the engine, if I hit it watch my whip swerve
Mask on, creep silent, watch me perv
I'm a situation starter but I'm excellent with words
I'm fanatic with them bags and I just jugg off them birds
And I'm a rack real haver so I talk with a slur
Mastermind of the trap but cleaned it up with rap
I got racks on racks on racks and all this shit here came off cap
Every time I talk that jug shit, I know you wanna trap
(I'm talkin' numbers on these beats boy, nah this ain't rap)
Nothin' but trap talk
