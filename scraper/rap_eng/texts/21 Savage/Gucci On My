[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Broke my wrist off in the pot (breakin' that)

Hoppin' out with double G, they thinkin' I was Wop (Wop)
Flooded wrist, I got the Breitling loaded (ice)
Now I can't even see the clock (nah)
Draco make his heart stop (rah)
Split him like a Pop Tart (split him)

In the back, Gucci golf cart (skrrt)
Heard you had to give the bread back
'Cause you couldn't get the sack off

[Verse 5: Offset]
Offset! Ayy
Gucci my collar, Gucci my bitch
Spend a lil' money, that shit ain't no problem (spend it)
Not good, I'm Gucci
Gave that bitch back to the hood, she groupin' (yeah)
My diamonds is clean, but my cup is polluted (lean)
I fucked up the scene and she act like she knew me (smash)
Open your lip, the stick start shootin'
Like pop pop-pop pop brrrrt (pop!)
I remember you used to be good on me
Now that I'm Gucci, I'm fuckin' these thots, thots
Connect with the plug like Wi-Fi
You know we on top, it is no tie
I'm fuckin' your bitch, nigga, why lie? (Smash)
Make the brick disappear, voilà
Yes, I'm a Migo, you know I'm a Migo
I'm shittin' on niggas like ca-ca (facts)
