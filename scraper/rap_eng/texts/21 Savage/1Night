[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm afraid of forever
And I'm afraid like never
I'ma play with you for one night, one night
All we ever need is one night, one night

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
21, 21
I'm kissin' on your neck for one night (for one night)
I'ma treat you like my wife for one night (for one night)
Give you the Bentley, let you ride for one night (for one night)
And I'ma put you on a flight the same night (the same night)
I got a problem and this shit ain't really right (really right)
I be switchin' different women every night (every night)
I don't save numbers, it's a waste of time (waste of time)
You say that you a wifey but you never could be mine (never mine)
One night, one night (one night)
It might be the best night of your life (your life)
They say I need to settle down, I tried (I tried)
Savage gettin' married, phew, yeah, right (21, 21)

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
You's a drinker, you's a smoker
Been a loner, you ain't in the mix
You a brick house, you a 36
Shawty on the low been gettin' money in and out
Shawty from the zoo, an animal like In-N-Out
I ain't 'bout commitment, show you what this pimpin' 'bout
If they ain't told you, I'ma tell you

[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm afraid of forever
And I'm afraid like never
I'ma play with you for one night, one night
All we ever need is one night, one night, yeah

[Chorus: 21 Savage & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm kissin' on your neck for one night (for one night)
I'ma treat you like my wife for one night (for one night)
I'ma play with you for one night, one night
All we ever need is one night, one night

[Verse 3: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Got a bitch in every room like a smoke detector
One white, one white just like salt and pepper
Shh, don't be selfish, don't be selfish, baby
Only one seat in that black Mercedes
Ah, ah, in there standin' on the couch
Pass 'em out like a fuckin' voucher
Vroom, love the way you motormouth
Skrrt, GPS straight up to the house
You fuck with Sean in the D, all in his DMs on Instagram
You fuck with Wiz in the P, comments on all of his Instagrams
You fuck with Drake in the 6, just admit you're a believer
It's never cheaper to keep her

[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm afraid of forever
And I'm afraid like never
I'ma play with you for one night, one night
All we ever need is one night, one night, yeah

[Chorus: 21 Savage & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm kissin' on your neck for one night (for one night)
I'ma treat you like my wife for one night (for one night)
I'ma play with you for one night, one night
All we ever need is one night, one night, hey, ayy, ayy
I'm kissin' on your neck for one night (for one night)
I'ma treat you like my wife for one night (for one night)
I'ma play with you for one night, one night
All we ever need is one night, one night

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Girl, go 'head and give it up
I'ma play with you for one night, one night
All we ever need is one night, one night
