[Intro: Lil Keed]
Aye where you get that beat from? Mooktoven!
Let's go
KeedToven

[Chorus: Lil Keed]
(Keed talk to ’em!)
Yeah yeah, Balenciaga steppin', watch yo' shoes
Yeah yeah, Balenciaga steppin’, south boy too
Yeah yeah, his gun visible, he not gon' shoot
Yeah yeah, peanut butter seats, yeah it's out the coupe
Yeah sticks on him and the shooter made the news
Smokin' Runts in a lil' bitty coupe, I dropped the roof
Rubber band of blue cheese nigga, I don't like it loose
And my bitches they got pretty feet, they don't own shoes
Worry bout that, this ain't that
Worry bout that, where yo’ check at?
Worry bout that, worry bout that
You worried bout this, and this ain’t that

[Verse 1: Lil Keed]
In that space coupe, free that nigga Ralph
We go way back like a sun roof, all these bitches rubbin' on me
I feel like I’m at Jay Juice, get that paper upfront
Before I even walk through (Keed talk to 'em!)
Let's go, me and my dog gonna get bands
Me and my dog fuck these hoes by the ten
It just me and my dog in that motherfuckin' Benz
I can’t wait for my dog to get out that fuckin' can

[Chorus: Lil Keed & 21 Savage]
(Keed talk to 'em!)
Yeah yeah, Balenciaga steppin', watch yo' shoes
Yeah yeah, Balenciaga steppin', south boy too
Yeah yeah, his gun visible, he not gon' shoot
Yeah yeah, peanut butter seats, yeah it's out the coupe
Yeah sticks on him and the shooter made the news
Smokin' Runts in a lil' bitty coupe, I dropped the roof
Rubber band of blue cheese nigga, I don't like it loose
And my bitches they got pretty feet, they don't own shoes
Worry 'bout that, this ain't that
Worry 'bout that, where yo' check at? (Bought a Vette)
Worry 'bout that (Bought a Vette), worry 'bout that (Straight up)
You worried 'bout this (Straight up, straight up), and this ain't that

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Yeah yeah, dropped my first mixtape and bought a Vette
Bought a '85 Cutlass off of crack
Balenciaga with Chanel, I mismatched
I'm Slaughter Gang don't get stabbed in your back
Ridin' with a K, draco, call it lowercase
Baby mama got a Kel-Tec she don't tote mace
"Savage, how you get your stain up?" Nigga even play
"Savage, why nobody wanna front you nothin'?" Cause I used to take
Balenciaga make yo' bitch wanna choose up
I'm in Hollywood hills with a shoota
I smoke dead people, I don't smoke hookah
4L-gang, I'm a dog, don't get chewed up
Saint Laurent on my back, this ain't fake nigga
I'm on Cleveland with Lil Keed and the snakes, nigga
Play with me, get long lived, from your name, nigga
Up eight figures, so I stopped wearing chains, nigga

[Chorus: Lil Keed]
(Keed talk to 'em!)
Yeah yeah, Balenciaga steppin', watch yo' shoes
Yeah yeah, Balenciaga steppin', south boy too
Yeah yeah, his gun visible, he not gon' shoot
Yeah yeah, peanut butter seats, yeah it's out the coupe
Yeah sticks on him and the shooter made the news
Smokin' Runts in a lil' bitty coupe, I dropped the roof
Rubber band of blue cheese nigga, I don't like it loose
And my bitches they got pretty feet, they don't own shoes
Worry bout that, this ain't that
Worry bout that, where yo' check at?
Worry bout that, worry bout that
You worried bout this, and this ain't that

[Verse 3: Lil Keed]
Choppa will blast that, I got all this fuckin' paper on me, I don't even cash out
Wearin' all that out of date jewelry, need to trash that
Yeah you hear them pipes on that fuckin' Hellcat, young nigga shit
Ridin' round with a fuckin' gat, you ain't killin' shit
You ain't even need a fuckin' strap, you ain't real as me
He ain't ever gave the love back, put the hood on my back
Put the hood on the map, comin' for the biggest bag

[Chorus: Lil Keed]
(Keed talk to 'em!)
Yeah yeah, Balenciaga steppin', watch yo' shoes
Yeah yeah, Balenciaga steppin', south boy too
Yeah yeah, his gun visible, he not gon' shoot
Yeah yeah, peanut butter seats, yeah it's out the coupe
Yeah sticks on him and the shooter made the news
Smokin' Runts in a lil' bitty coupe, I dropped the roof
Rubber band of blue cheese nigga, I don't like it loose
And my bitches they got pretty feet, they don't own shoes
Worry bout that, this ain't that

Worry bout that, worry bout that
You worried bout this, and this ain't that
