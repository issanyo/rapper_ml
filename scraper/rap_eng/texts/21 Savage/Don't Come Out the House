[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Bang outside, I hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
Bang outside, I hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
Bang outside, hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
Bang outside, hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
13, got my first stripe, nigga (First stripe)
Glenwood road, where they shiest', nigga
Slaughter Gang so I keep a knife, nigga
We was broke so all we ate was rice, nigga
Paid the J's to cut on my mama's lights, nigga
Come get your bitch, she tryna spend the night, nigga (Straight up)
You a bitch, that make her a dyke, nigga (Pussy)
All these bodies, I can't sleep at night, nigga
Y'all must thought that I was gon' whisper the whole time (21)
I ran out of weed, I sent your bitch out of town (On God)
Gave her fifteen hundred and she came back with pounds (Straight up)
Rappers think they it, but they really just clowns (On God)
Gucci store, a hundred thou', that's just in a day (On God)
Always cheatin', I'm a dog, think I need a cage (On God)
Savage loaded, chips and dip, I'm not talkin' 'bout Lays (21)
Throwback Rafs, call 'em retros, I'm not talkin' 'bout J's (21)
First name 21, last name Hefner, I got too many freaks (21)
Levi jeans, low self-esteem, he on BlackPeopleMeet (21)
Look like MÃ½a, she's on fire, who got the keys to my Jeep? (Straight up)
Who want smoke 'cause I want smoke, I had a wet dream about beef (21)

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Bang outside, hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
Bang outside, I hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Kids see my car, they get to playin' Bingo (Skrrt skrrt)
Off-brand rappers stealin' all the lingo (I did that first)
Thirty on my hip, the label want a single (On God)
I green light hits, I don't make jingles (Straight up)
Shut your damn mouth 'fore you drop, nigga (Drop nigga)
Last nigga dissed me dropped, nigga (Straight up)
I want smoke, nigga, all, nigga (On God)
Savage kill all of his opps, nigga (21)
Smoke the mall last week, ball nigga (21)
Slaughter Gang, yeah, we brawl, nigga (Straight up)
4L Gang, lot of shots, nigga
Savage kill all of his opps, nigga (Pussy)

[Outro: Lil Juice & Future]
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
