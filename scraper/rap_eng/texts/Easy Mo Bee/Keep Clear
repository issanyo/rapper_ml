[Intro]
Yo, uh
One two, one two
Another hit from the mind of the menace
Do you wanna play tennis?
Sometimes I like to be left alone
So get the fuck outta here

[Verse 1: Vents]
I keep searching for the
Better me, cannabis is the remedy
We puff heavily and find positive energy
Live and let be my philosophy
So you can leave me alone with this pornography
My potential is infinite
I'm Angus Young on the instrument, Vents killin' it
We considering the point of existence
I wrote this rhyme for the joy of the listeners
This is the era been through the weather
The cold is the gold that holds us together
I escape from my youth with a flesh wound
And I got it real deep like Neptune
Left the nest and I flew; soared like
An eagle and witnessed the evil that men do
For the love of money, nothing funny
About survival, pick the briefcase or the rifle

[Chorus]
Wake up and I'm lifted
Young and I'm gifted, number one misfit
"[?]"
I've always been different
"Keep clear" "[?]"
Wake up and I'm lifted
Young and I'm gifted, number one misfit
"[?]"
I've always been distant
"Keep clear"

[Verse 2: Vents]
Yeah I'd rather be
Rich but I'm getting by. I got
Love for my friends that'll never die
Generation Y, stay glued to the revolution
In high resolution, the natives want retribution
My solution? Slide into apathy
Wasted potential, tragedy, casualty
Of the brave new world I'm in
Where the common man seldom win let's begin yo
You can make enough money till the ladies love ya
It's funny how the money make 'em hate each other
I can feel the last ciggie in my artery
And I'm chained to this city like it's part of me
Jealousy. Cunts wanna' start on me
Coz I'm kicking goals like Napoli, pardon me
While I kiss the sky and your friendship
Request has been denied, motherfucker

[Chorus]
Wake up and I'm lifted
Young and I'm gifted, number one misfit
"[?]"
I've always been different
"Keep clear" "[?]"
Wake up and I'm lifted
Young and I'm gifted, number one misfit
"[?]"
I've always been distant
"Keep clear"

(Yo leave me alone)

[Verse 3: Vents]
Yo smoke by the elbow
Blow it out the window, playin' my Nintendo
Lot of young blokes must have never got the memo
If you tryna' fuck don't get stuck in the friendzone
Yo smoke by the elbow
Blow it out the window, playin' my Nintendo
Lot of young blokes must have never got the memo
If you tryna' fuck don't get stuck in the friendzone
Smoke by the elbow
Blow it out the window
Playin' my Nintendo
If you tryna' fuck don't get stuck in the friendzone
We just smoke by the elbow
Then we blow it out the window
Playin' my Nintendo
If you tryna' ... don't get ... in the friendzone
Son
