[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G., Craig Mack]
Produce, nigga
I'm high as a motherfucker
You ain't higher than me, nigga
No doubt nigga, I'm fucked up man
I'm fucked up
We out here
Lyrics, lyrics, more lyrics
Anyway, here comes the Mack back in full effect
My man Biggie Smalls in the shit, you know what I'm saying
He tryna hold me back, you know what I'm saying
And won't let me get down, but you know what? I'm getting down?

[Hook: Craig Mack]
Let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down
(I just wanna funk a little bit)
Let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down
(I just wanna get a little bit)
Let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down
(I just wanna funk a little bit)
Yo, let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
To my motherfuckin man 50 Grand, the alcoholic man (ahh!)
Inject a tall can in his bloodstream if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
MC provoker, chocolate thai smoker, huh?
I like to max in Maximas and Acuras (let me get down!)
Your girl buttcheeks I'm smackin', huh?
The raw rapper, spine snapper
With the little hookers on my lap-ah
You know the flavor Mack-uh (I know the flavor, yeah)
A shy nigga but I ain't your fuckin' comforter
And if I ever fall in love I bet I'm fuckin' her
Ask the hooker, if I didn't jook her
If she try to front, then I drop the Chucky Booker on her
"Why you wanna, play your games on me?"
Bitch, ya crazy?
Commitments, I'm Swayze, no time for the ill shit
Rest with the niggas on that real blood-spill shit (ah!)
My rappin' tactics are drastic
Stretchin' motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my pedigree (ahhh!)
You better be, filled with energy, niggas never gettin me (get down!)
So let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down! (Aaaah, ahh!)

[Hook: Craig Mack]
Let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down
(Let me get down, funk a little bit!)
Let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down
(I just wanna funk a little bit, haaa!)
Let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down
(I just wanna get a little, biiiit)
Yo, let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down
(Here he come with)

[Verse 2: Craig Mack]
[???]
'Cause the rhyme that I kick is called the MC stomp
Here comes the one they call king of the MCs
Shaking down enemies with rhymes like these, boy
I'm bad, bad to the bone
Freaking up styles, wickity wild
Pass the microphone
I tell you suckers strange, Biggie my man
I got MCs melting inside my mouth and not inside my hand
My species eliminates MCs
[?] with 3rd degrees
I bring the funk from the floors, MCs here
So from here to Warsaw I roar
The maclalicious, this nigga's vicious
MC from '94 leaves your ho making wishes
No saving MCs misbehavin'
[?]
I got the funk bleeding all out the trunk
Names all over, so I'm going for the pump
I come from the underground, so let me get down
Let him get down, let me get down

[Hook: Craig Mack]
Let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down
(I just wanna funk a little bit
Let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down
(I just wanna go, haaa!)
Let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down
