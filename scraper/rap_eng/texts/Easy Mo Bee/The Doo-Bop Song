[Hook: J.R. ?]
Just kickin' that doo-bop sound, just kickin' that doo-bop sound
Just kickin' that doo-bop sound, just kickin' that doo-bop sound
Just kickin' that doo-bop sound, just kickin' that doo-bop sound
Just kickin' that doo-bop sound, just kickin' that doo-bop sound

[Verse 1: Easy Mo Bee]
Lets kick a verse for my man called Miles
'Cause seems to me his music's gonna be around for a long while
'Cause hes a multi-talented and gifted musician
Who can play any position
It's no mystery that you're no risk to me
'Cause I'm the love and tell your girl to throw a kiss to me
And hop in bed and have a fight with the pillow
Turn off the lights and let the J give it to ya
And let the trumpet blow as I kick this
'Cause rap is fundamental and Miles sounds so wicked
A little taste of the be-bop sound with the backdrop
Of doo-hop and this is why we can call it the doo-bop

[Hook: J.R. ?]
Just kickin' that doo-bop sound, just kickin' that doo-bop sound
Just kickin' that doo-bop sound, just kickin' that doo-bop sound
Just kickin' that doo-bop sound, just kickin' that doo-bop sound
Just kickin' that doo-bop sound, just kickin' that doo-bop sound
With Miles
Miles Davis
Just kickin' it

[Verse 2: Easy Mo Bee & A.B. Money]
Now go ahead and play like a wannabe
You know it's gonna be
Hate to cut the throats of MCs up in front of me
When I'm out blow make the A want to sing
My rhymes be shinin' on brothers
Like they flippin' on they high beams
And when I just come through
You think you bad 'cause somebody seen you
Climbing the tree like Jack-Be-Nimble
Yo, Miles blow the trumpet off a A&M symbol
Miles Davis style is different, you can
Describe it as pacific
He rip, rage and roar, no time for watchin' Andy Griffith
You can [whistle] all you want, go head
While he take to doo-wop and mix it with be-bop
Just like a maker in the shoe shop, Easy Mo Bee will cream you
Like the nougat
And usually we doo-wop but since Miles Wanna cool out
You can do that Miles, blow your trumpet
Show the people
Just what it's to do

[Hook: J.R. ? & A.B. Money]
Just kickin' that doo-bop sound, just kickin' that doo-bop sound
(Yeah, this one is for doo-bop)
Just kickin' that doo-bop sound, just kickin' that doo-bop sound
Just kickin' that doo-bop sound, just kickin' that doo-bop sound
Just kickin' that doo-bop sound, just kickin' that doo-bop sound
With Miles
Miles Davis
Just kickin' it
