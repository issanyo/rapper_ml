{Lyrics]
I said i's the M U S T
Show em what your best be
Say witcha chest
Make a whole
Mess about it
I'm like the time you missed
A job
Phone left on silent
Now I'mm thinkin I ring the alarm
Get em checkin' sound
Mic check
1 2 1 2
If i tell you I hate you
What you gon do
Really
I'm not the type to go and do somethin to em
Unless they really wanna feel it out
And do somethin to

I'm livin to get it some
Bring it back
Break the bread with some
I'm lookin ahead
And I'm bringing back
My family from
The warmest place ever
You shoulda seen it
They had all kinds a shit
It was so scenic
Believe it if I tell you that I really think I seen it
But I swear to god I saw some woman lookin' like the phoenix
On Rihanna chest
Not to talk Rihanna less
But the way this shorty lookin' got me rocked
Like monolith
Coupled with sand over the floor
Blue ocean galore
Give me your hand I'll give u more
Of this
Give and go just like Bogut did
Give me hope for my inner Warrior
Causin the warmin' of this here lil' story up
Keepin this glorious feelin alive
I mean the glory of feelin alive
But back to now
Would say dappered down
But a hoodies what I'm feelin
When I pass the glass around
Homies sittin laughin bout
All the legal
Gas that they pass around
Knowing we lost brothers in the past just for
Gassin out
Damn
We givin em pass since they passed the loud?
Fam
Guess you got it bad tryna cash it out
You on a plastic route
We on a quest to lounge heavy
'round plenty round pools swimmin' plenty found
Fools that we kick with now
Ruling every limit leavin clues for the next of sound
Tools for the next of kin
Maybe they won't have to see the struggles
That we saw as kids
Maybe you won't have to get your guard up
Boy
Forget the fake love I tell you from the start up
Homies say get your cake up
Then sub the ice for stardust boy
Get with the flow or get lost
As I sheppard in all these hijacked
Wrist watches
Time is relevant
But we all think this hard as shit
I cycle and shuffle through pages
Head is working double time
Suckin up all information
Spit it out into a rhyme
Spit it make fit in a rhythm spin it 'cus it didn't fly
Sittin on two minutes about
The realest around
Hypocrisy is fillin the sound
And I'm here to resound it
And turnin it the fuck up
'Till these buildings are grounded
I'm cyclically countin the cards
In the deck and its hard to keep check
'Cus I'm not the one who gets to keep the cards in the end
And as hard is it gets
I keep that bad boy heart on my flesh
Since Craig Mack gave em audible sets
See I was raised by hip-hop
I will march through the storm
You get your brains from gift shops where they bargain for more
Knowing their inventory fraudulent
You just keep on coppin' it
Saying that they got the deals and I should line they pockets with my Real money
Deal money
Future looking sealed money
Fingers steady itching for as long as I could feel money
Taught to go and steal money
But what yours is yours
And I know you’d rather have me on the street begging for more
But
What’s mine is mine too
