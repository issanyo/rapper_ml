Yeah
I wanna talk to you for a lil bit
And I brought my girl Faith... Evans
Along for the ride, Ahh

I've never thought about it, love what I do without it?
Heartaches that I have seen before
I learned enough about it, what I could do without and
I made the vow that I would change
No I just couldn't see what I needed from me
But all these things happened before

[Chorus]
If I'll fall in love again, He'll will be more than just a friend
He will be strong
He'll be a Friend, Love, Companionship everything I want in life
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me baby

See I would give my love any way I could give
But things ain't always what they seem I tell you girl I've been there, I've been there
My heart would break everyday and every night I would cry
But that was so, long ago
I... know I just couldn't see what I needed for me
But all these things happened before

[Chorus]
If I'll fall in love again, He'll will be more than just a friend, just a friend
He will be strong, (He will be strong, and he will be my)
He'll be a Friend, Love Companionship, (Let's get them KC), everything I want in life
You know I got your back girl
Give it to me, give it to me, come on, give it to me baby, come on

See I couldn't work it out, I just couldn't figure it out, figure it out
What you might need from me, more than I had to give...Up
Things that are meant to be ...They put a big strain on your life
But now it's so obvious cause I took a stand back from your love
No, I just couldn't see what I needed for me, but all these things happened before

[Chorus]
If I'll fall in love again, He'll will be more than just a friend, just a friend
He will be strong, ohhh
He'll will be.... A Friend, Love Companionship , everything I want in life
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me baby, yeah, yeah
