[Intro: Notorious B.I.G.]
Yeah, mothafuckas better know
Huh (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls
Huh, yeah
(I'm a bad, bad, bad)

[Notorious B.I.G.]
My man Inf left a Tec and a 9 at my crib
Turned his self in, he had to do a bid
A 1-to-3, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G: you with me?

[Young Biggie]
Motherfucking right, my pockets looking kinda tight
And I'm stressed
Yo, Biggie let me get the vest

[Notorious B.I.G.]
No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat, the Tec is to his back
Word is bond, I'mma smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move

[Young Biggie]
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbing motherfuckas since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same .45
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing, "It's so hard."

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Yes, loveâ€”love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy, that's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whipping
Welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant

[Young Biggie]
I'm slamming niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
'Cause mom dukes ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
When I bust my Gat, mothafuckas take dirt naps
I'm all that, and a dime sack, where the paper at?

[Interlude]
When he's sticking you and taking all of your money

[Chorus]
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
And I'm shooting niggas quick if ya hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in ya back and headpiece
The opposite of peace, sending Mom duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
'Cause when I lick shots, them shits is persistent

[Young Biggie]
Goodness gracious, the papers!
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug .357 slug
And my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip

[Notorious B.I.G.]
One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Motherfuckas better strip, (yeah, nigga, peel)
Before you find out how blue steel feel

[Young Biggie]
From the Beretta, putting all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckas don't know better
Rolex watches and colorful Swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckas can't stop it

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Man niggas come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get strangled for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her doorknockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka

[Young Biggie]
So go get your man, bitch, he can get robbed too

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
Man I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I set it, the cocksucker won't forget it

[Interlude]
Hey bitch, hey bitch, gimme your money bitch
(When he's sticking you and taking all your money)

[Chorus]
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)

[Young Biggie]
Man listen, all this walking is hurting my feet
Ooh, money looks sweet

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Where?

[Young Biggie]
In the Isuzu jeep

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Man, I throw him in the fiend you grab the fucking cream
And if he start to scream, bom-bom, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar

[Young Biggie]
Ooh, Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the Gat

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Yo, chill shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot

[Young Biggie]
Oh shit the cops

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts

[Young Biggie]
So why the fuck he keep looking?

[Notorious B.I.G.]
I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see central booking
Oh shit, now he looking in my face
You better haul ass 'cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, cause I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucka going out for the loot

[Outro]
Take that motherfuckers
