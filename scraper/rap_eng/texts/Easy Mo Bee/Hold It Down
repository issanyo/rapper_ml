Yeah yeah, aaah, diggy Das nigga, diggy Das what what??
Yeah what?

[Chorus]

Got ta hold it down
Hold it down, nigga keep it on lock
Hold it down, nigga yeah, nigga keep it on lock
*repeat x3*

[Verse 1]

(Dray)
I be the man droppin the slang on your premises
We the menaces, slaying rappers like they're Genesis
Now what the hell is this I heard you wanna see this
Ya best believe this kid, I got more rhymes than Run got Adidas
You can't defeat us so just back up off the metaphor
The Boogie Banger tell me what the hell's the art for?

(Books)
Bringin it from the sewer it's the Boogie Bang
Use to kick the rookie slang, critics wonder "Could he hang?"
Drop my first joint and made the whole world flip
Next trip, critics that wasn't wit it popped lip (like what?)
'Iggedy that and Iggedy this'
But fuck thiggedy that, get off my diggedy dick

Chorus

[Verse 2]

(Books)
Higgedy halt! It's the Prince of Darkness here to spark this
Miggity mic, my target's the underground market
I be the rapper-in-chief, the editor etcetera
The miggity mad dred night predator
Cos all the time, nigga's be frontin in their rhymes
Claimin to represent the bastards, missin classes, doin crime
But when I come thru they be like "Oooh look, the Man!"
Shakin niggas down like the earth shook Japan

(Dray)
Well all I need is my 40, some Buddha and my Timbs
My biggity black Benz with them 19 inch rims
I gotta maintain and at the same time I watch my ass
Get cash, cos any fuckin day could be your last
I took a breather now we snipin off the roof
We back up in the booth and gettin busy off the 100 proof
Of Vodka, I rock a rhyme just for the thrill of it
Cos when I'm spillin it I'm fillin it, check how I'm killin it

Chorus

[Verse 3]

(Dray)
Well errytime I write a rhyme I takes some time to make it rougher
So suffer, y'know it's me the nicotine puffer brother
I miggity made this for the snitches, cos for the riches
We never changing faces like them two singin bitches
So hold it down for '95 or you's a goner
Big up to all my peoples on corner puffin marijuana

(Books)
A giggedy Great like Dane, we rode the game
In '92 wit my crew, ain't a thing changed
But the styles, the miles on the jeep, the beamer
The drawers on my ass, the herb grass got greener
My knocker plus we droppin the skills off the top of
The dome for my peoples in the sewer, yo I got ta....

Chorus

Outro: Dray
