Yeah, i'm kicking new flavor in ya ear
While the haters run in fear
Beating me, you gotta better chance
Saving your career
The only person that you
Really hate is in the mirror
Self reflective thoughts
Couldn't make it any clear
Taught myself
How to rap before I learned to write
Sippin' tea, Darren Sipity's
The Kermit type
Take offense
Every chance that you get
This'll be the only song
I'mma answer you with, it goes
Fuck a jealous hater
And his lying mouth
I'm trying to put my small
Family in a giant house
Trying to put my small
Family in a giant house
Find out how i'm defying doubts
While i'm flying south
With everything going
According to plan
I pray you never find out that
It's a glorious scam
A warrior family
Grew up on Notorious jams
Mind sharper than the
Sword in his hand, it goes
One nation under god
But above the law
Minimum wage against the machine
As i juggle jobs
It's me against the world
And i love the odds
Me against the universe
You're in trouble god
Don't believe in those that don't
Believe in energy
Dopamine and hennessy
Sober me's an enemy
To the public, hold a grudge
Like i'm holding drugs
Growing up, show motherfuckers
What getting older does
Folgers in my cup
Older than america
Guerilla warfare for any
Soldier in the area
Home of the brave
Poems from a slave
Get on stage
Take the microphone from ya fav'
Get in my zone
Won't return home for days
Refusing assimilation
Say i'm stuck in my ways
Kid from the rez
With indigenous views
If it was up to him
This ain't the living he'd choose
Make music for the reds
That will give the the blues
Still winnin' on behalf of haters
Wishing he'd lose
