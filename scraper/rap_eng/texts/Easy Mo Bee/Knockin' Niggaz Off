Chorus (x3):

We just be knockin niggas off, knockin niggas out

Verse 1: Dray, Skoob

Well let me get busy on the track one time, who's this?
It's diggity Das EFX and, yo, you know we never miss (never miss uh)
Cos son you know I get mine everyday
I don't play so hey, check the shit I say (Dray)
I'm comin thru with the flow and, yo, my nigga Boogie Banger
Flipped from here all the way to Alabama
And, yo, you know I gots to get nice, precise
And plus I get the slice from dice
So Boogie Banger, son I know you got my back
React, cos on the track you never come wack

Yo the Boogie Banger bringin danger to the rap game (no doubt)
I kick a rhyme and rip the spine out'cha back frame
Yeah, I'm at the peak of my career
And wack niggas ain't got a motherfuckin prayer
I swear this day must be my lucky (why?)
Cos niggas wants to be me and bitches wants to fuck me

Chorus (x2)

Verse 2: Skoob

Sufferin suckertash, another smash is in the makers, niggas hatin
My stiggity style that bringin home the bacon
It's the East Coast niggas, we roast niggas like whatever
My place or your place, North Face and leathers
Hot potato, I ain't afraid of you
MC's who wanna test me, so let's see what you made of
Put ya batter up and you'll get your batter struck
No matter what season, I'm comin through hot
Chock full & nut-swingin, the funk worker
I quick to flip a mic just like a wave can flip a surfer
I'm first to rope a dragon, and I yoke a joker, stab ya if I gotta
For nada, when I heat up the flow I spit lava
Pack a 'istol that cream your army like some Harvey Twisters
Wipin out MC's like I had to the fuckin swivel
It's too tragic, fat like blue magic, you faggot
I bring your whole fuckin crew static

Chorus (x4)

Verse 3: Dray

Yah, uh, yo
Well um, here I come so do me if you can
But I'mma end your shit like BDP did MC Shan (yeah yeah nigga)
I keep it goin, son you know I never stop
We holdin' down the block and got the real hip-hop
Now cock your Glock and money bust a few
The crew, It's diggity Das EFX I thought you knew

Chorus (x6)

(The way it's goin down in the underground)
