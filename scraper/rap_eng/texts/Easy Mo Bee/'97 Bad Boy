Verse 1 [860Rod]

All of you mad I get more butt than ashtrays
Birthed in '97 so I'm with the ass play
You could eat shit, top it with the pate
When I'm outdone that'll probably be my last day
Quick, let me get a towel for my grundle
And when I'm finished lob it in the other team huddle
I'm finna start a schism, and all of ya'll tryna cuddle
I'm shootin for stars,the gods and Allahs is befuddled
Get to they level they mug like central bookin'
Lookin' like they just ain't tryna get their life tooken
I put a god in the earth and cover with turf
And take Mary home, I got her lovin' the surf
I ain't praying I'm just waiting for Beyonce
Get some play on the radio be on Sway
Tune the airwaves you could hear me all day
I ain't fuckin' round I'm promising I'm beyond play

Hook

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Verse 2 [860Rod]

I sit back and bust rhymes like Mac 11s
Maybe that's why I feel like Bad Boy in '97
Never going Hollywood but still a lethal weapon
I'm bustin out raps till I got my homies and my brethren
Mackin' game, it ain't spotty like Craig's face
I just pull a Mase in church and I don't leave my place
Hold up hold up, I ain't shit holy
Sayin' fuck the universe and also matrimony
Gimme a girl with morals and soon she beggin' to bone me
Hit it a couple months, now she seem alone like she Posty
I was like Mike on the kitty I jammed the space
Threw on a hoodie and abandoned the place
Now I'm chillin' illustrating smoother than legato
Drivers seat cruising destination El Dorado

Hook

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Verse 3 [860Rod]

I ain't Frank White not a blanco El Chapo
I'm just tryna get my stacks high like Colorado
With the vato rolling flower every hour after hour
Diesel sour, but I tough it out like Eddie Bauer
Steady how I'm grinding currently to get a check
Best protect ya neck on my Hannibal Lect
Fruity loop serial I'll kill a couple verse
When it come back around I'm going in caddy hearse
Buried in a Coogi cuz it's motherfuckin' boujee
Ooh he, tryna be royalty like a Louis
That's a hypothetical for little down the road
Smoking medical for now to get a little throwed
Showing still to 9 to 5 just to get the cash up
Gassed up shawty stroking slow like molasses
That's enough for now I'm outta breath
Flava beat to death
