Hayyyyy!
Break it down big ba-ty, here to rock the par-ty
(c'mon) Break a sucker down to dust, ah-hah
Do what I must *inhale* ooh what a rush
Lyrical muderer, microphone bone crusher
Yeah yeah y'all
Break a sucker down to dust, ah-hah

Now check the mic stalker, will wear you out like Walker
Rock a microphone like I was a native New Yorker
I strike hard like Ben Frank's lightning rod
Leave you suckers scarred (uh-huh) leave you suckers charred
Now you're burnt to a crisp, so check the vocalist
I get sick with my shit, wicked like sadistics
It'll be a +Black Moon+ when I _Enta Da Stage_
Grab the microphone, turn from Robin to Rage
Then I shoot from the jugular, I get rough and ruggeder
You can't front on this big body Southerner
Your shit'll get smacked back, you're booty like asscrack
Who reigns supreme, baby no need to ask that
I bust on the daily, get down to the roots like Hailey
As I proceed to rock the mic, feel me, I
Gets total wreck and make crews pop, I
Rock from Osaka down to the Boondocks
Pop goes the rhyme on you weasels (uh-huh)
Rock strictly for my peoples, strictly for those Prince Edward evils
As I, blow up like spontaneous combustion, hah
I'll be the +Queen+ of MC's that's +Flushing+, hah
And ain't no maybe's, or might be's, cause if the mic be
Within reaches of my psyche, I just eat it up like Mikey
(I like it) when I'm weeded, so beat it, don't let me get heated
Or you just might get stretched out like Sealy Posturepedic
(Believe it) so it is said, so it is written
Until the day that I'm dead, I'll keep hittin
Always and forever spittin, from my soul for real
Down yellow brick roads I will, uhh
Chase them dreams, make more snap than green beans
Ask Mr. Greenjeans who's the Captain, I'm slappin
Fast-actin like Tinactin, mo' deeper than the ?
So get crackin, you don't wanna Clash with this Titan
Whether freestylin or writin, the way I be breakin off mics man
I'm twirlin MC's like I'm Major Wreck
Cause I'm a major threat, once again Rage in effect

HAH, Necessary Rough when I bust
Enter your zones, microphones get crushed, I..
I break a sucker down to dust, ah-hah
I do what I must *inhale* ooh what a rush, c'mon!
Necessary Rough when I bust (UHH)
Enter your zones, microphones get crushed, I..
I break a sucker down to dust, ah-hah
I do what I must *inhale* ooh what a rush

Now tell me who in the place wanna taste? (who?)
I'm rhymin til I'm blue in the face so face, the, facts
Don't look back, or you're gonna be salty
Uhh, ah-hah, you best take flight like Maltese, Falcon
You're scalpin, your hearts palpitatin
Fluttering from the uttering of the vocab when I spake it
When I spit it, wack MC's get ommitted
Now did it not occur to you, that I could serve a few
Good men or women, cause I'ma, equal opportunity, HAYYY
You're bound to lose, unless your name is Parker Lewis
Now let's do this, let the games begin (uh-huh)
Got suckers on the sideline mad as a wet hen, so you best
Step with that rambling, you're gambling with fate
I got suckers scrambling like quarterbacks from Grambling State
So, don't eff around Tootsie, you might get Roll-ed up
Sewed up, you best play like crutch and fold up
HOLD UP, watch me flip shit like a gymnast Mary Lou Retton
Best play like Omega Psi Phi and start steppin
Jettin on the first Delta out
Cause I make mics melt in my mouth
Takin em out is all I'm about, now check me OWWWWWWWWT
For hip-hop, I dies off with a vengeance
My vocab blows doors off it's hinges, with every sentence
And since this is the new age, uhh, ah-hah
All lyrical concoctions, by lyrical murderer Rage
Got a vertical hold, on verbal abusin ways
Cervical tubes get spayed, neutered, get slayed, tutored, DONE
Blood shit, on nuff shit, quick, handcuff this
Cause it's definitely Necessary Roughness

HAH, Necessary Rough when I bust
Enter your zones, microphones get crushed, I..
I break a sucker down to dust, ah-hah
I do what I must *inhale* ooh what a rush
Necessary Rough when I bust
Enter your zones, microphones get crushed, I..
I break a sucker down to dust, ah-hah
I do what I must *inhale* ooh what a rush

Necessary Rough when I bust
Microphones get crushed, I..
Break a sucker down to dust
Do what I must *inhale* what a rush
Necessary Rough when I bust
Enter your zones, microphones get crushed, I..

I do what I must *inhale* what a rush

Necessary Rough *inhale* ooh what a rush
Necessary Rough *inhale* ooh what a.. ooh what a.. *echoes*
