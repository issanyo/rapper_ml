Easy Mo Bee and Miles Davis

[Verse 1: Easy Mo Bee]
Here I am, Easy Mo Bee
Kickin' it live with the legendary Miles Davis
Just my favorite
And his trumpet can't be played with
Tampered with or picked up and thrown to the pavement
With the left and right, boy, the right, the left
Wherever microphone is kept
You'll be sure to hear Miles do the woobity shoo bop
Just to show us he be created for doo-hop
Not doo-wop, but beebop mixed with hip hop
Don't be confused, let your [congos ?2:21] flip-flop
So relax with the trumpet, Jeep's just bumpin'
As for the girls, pumpin'
And make way for display in this way
Easy Mo Bee and Miles Davis gets busy
To the sound of his horn on the center
Relax and let go, and me at the cheek
We'll just blow
Yeah, me and Miles are gonna blow
I said, me and the chief are gonna blow
Yeah, me and Miles are gonna blow
Ayo, chief, blow
