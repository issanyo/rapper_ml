[Intro]
Yeah Mo Bee, drop it on me
Lets do it like this

[Verse 1]
If I was your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb
If you had the strength to walk out my door
My love would overrule my sense
And I'd call you back for more

[Chorus]
If I was your woman
If I was your woman
And you were my man (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
She tears you down darling
Says your nothing at all
But I'll pick you up darling
When she lets you fall
Cause you're like a diamond
But she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you
But me you won't ask

[Chorus]
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, no no stop loving you (yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Life is so crazy
And love is unkind
Because she was first darling
Will she hang on your mind
You're a part of me
But you don't even know it
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it

[Chorus]
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, no no stop loving you
If I were your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, never stop loving you

[Outro]
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
