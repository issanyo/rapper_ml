[Verse 1]

Ugh

Bunny hopping wit a noose around my neck/ Piggybacking flipping backwards im the the coolest from the set/ Benji dropping bombs while Reek and Zy hookin we soon connect/ Its 4 up in the chamber word to mommy ain't no games I really hate the gun chatter cuz I seen the gun splatter/ Im almost done with school my man that's word to my Alma matter/ Lost my mind a couple times I found it wit a Dutchy and a pound a loud/ Round of applause when penny come around they feel this joyous sound when I spit a rhyme wit a noun its the dopest instrumentation I fit the words in a placement/ Combined it like a wordsmith I hit earth wit/ A thousand pounds of fuckin AstroTurf like does it deserve it, you need to just...

[Verse 2]


Papa left when I was younger feeling real deserted/ I use the knife that I be wielding cutting all these curtains/ Unmasking all your idols man these niggas really hurting/ Packing away they problems tryna hide it in a check but it's really uncomfortable like Beats inside a fucking slim fitted hooded Nike Tech/ The fitted friction suffocating causing arthritis again/ I ignite wit the pen I mean I'm just swinging like pendulum's put the pack on my back no backin up handling flow I lay it down, real fucking delicate/ Lookin at my future through a telescope its close enough/ Tryna get on top of my game cuz young penny approaching fame I spit it vicious so that you can Just you could know my name just listen/
