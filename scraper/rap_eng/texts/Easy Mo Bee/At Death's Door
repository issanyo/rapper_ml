[Verse 1]
Incentive bedroom eyes
Fascination; reason why I'm traumatized
Lost inside a land in where we all spread lies
Trapped behind the surface that's behind red skies
Where most success lies
And my blunt still rolled
In the jaws of death and watch the Earth get smoked
Launched into eternity
Where minds get blown
At the Devil's door where time remains unknown
There's no place called home
At the point of death
Until my mother starts bitching
She'll sit in bed and cry if she knew the shit I seen and witnessed
Tryna talk to God but I ain't asking for forgiveness
I'm tryna stay alive and pray this Glock get me to Christmas
Mama's gonna wish that she ain't never overlook me
I plan to die alone and hell's exactly where I should be
Cause death is just a mile away
Enslaved; living my days with one foot in the grave

[Chorus]
With one foot in the grave
God has cursed my whole existence
Til the day I'm gone
I'm living with one foot in the grave
Time has got my whole world spinning
Pray until I'm gone and missing

[Verse 2]
Life's a test
I sit in silence
Living timeless til my last breath
Picture diamonds in the islands of eternal rest
Where the horizon's always smiling in the wild west
So this joint is for my niggas getting county checks
The juvenile and public figures that resist arrest
Street politicians on a mission that demand respect
Murder victims living hidden as a suspect
"Free any nigga testified against"
Pray I shoot blanks
Cause imma bust a shot for every time I was in pain
Much evil in the world
It seems okay to be insane
You should've never kept this mother-fucker in a cage
Serving on the corner with a pocket full of rocks
Hanging with the thug mother-fuckers on the block
All I ever did rob cause it was easy picking locks
Tryna lay low living next door to a cop
"Can you feel me"
Mama can you kick me out later
The streets is kind hot and it ain't room for a player
God I don't ask a lot but this more than a favor
Make sure that I survive cause I ain't worthy of a prayer
"Protect my vision"
Protect my vision
Relentless of my condition
The world I live in is magnified with superstition
The street tuition; living life in a daze
Holding to pain and maintain
Selling caine with one foot in the grave

[Chorus]
With one foot in the grave
God has cursed my whole existence
Til the day I'm gone
I'm living with one foot in the grave
Time has got my whole world spinning
Pray until I'm gone and missing

[Verse 3]
I used to think the of life was paradise and new beginnings
My circumstance could let alone enhance unhappy endings
A cash advance would only help expand a way of living
If I withstand the devil's avalanche in my conditions
I'll have a chance to maybe refinance the world I live in
Hypnotic trance; allow my time demand to run me twisted
Then understand just where the pain began that I'm defending
If we lose again
I vow to apprehend for better winnings
My block is like a sanctuary for your known abuses
Mistreatment is a social weakness for your execution
Yet stress relief
You function of a peace
When time's delusioned
But fail to breathe
You know you can't recieve the air we using
So tell me is you really down to ride
I never trust a bitch
But Nina's always by my side
Tell mama don't cry when her son become a ghost
Dry your eyes and play this record every time you're feeling low
To the niggas on the corner out the moving getting paid
Or the mother-fuckers hoeing that's still grinding getting laid
And if these mother-fuckers want it
Show em that you ain't afraid
Keep that mother-fucker on me cause it could go down today
With one foot in the grave

[Outro]
So there you have it
God has a way of changing life for a nigga
But we ain't scared though
We ain't hiding
Whatever happens happens nigga
Imma still be that same mother-fucker
Spitting these mother-fucking dope ass lyrics you listening to
Learn to live with one foot in the grave nigga
God is my savior
