[Hook]
"Alright" (repeatedly)

No doubt
Aha, see what you want baby?
Check it out! One-two for my peeps like this, check it out

[Verse One: Skoob]
To the, aah, tick tick, my clique is mad thick so don't slip (yeah)
Cos mad nigga's throats gettin slit
By the mister wit the heat ta burn ya til ya blister
You punk bitch, when the funk hit, the tongue twister (yeah)
It's the...no I'm the maniac with the flow, I don't
Til I knock out your regulars and your gold teeth (nigga)
Be doin my thing on a day-to-day (ha ha)
Some say I got too much posse like Flavor Flav
Books in reverse, the worst nigga out the clique (what?)
Cee-lo Satan when I hit you with the triple six
You should be stressin this lesson I'm flexin with the adjectives
Shittin on MC's like I just took a laxative
Now niggas know I gives a fuck about'cha crew
You try to keep up but got stuck like the two
Between nevers and Atlantis, I kicks it frantic
And god damn it, watch me and my man rock the planet
Like this, boy!

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Dray]
Well uhh, one-two, comin thru next
Nigga Krazy Drayzie representin Das EFX
Stompin wit my crew comin thru your projects
Bring ya from the east, so fuck the beast, so if ya spot 'em
You'd do us all a favor if you pulled your piece and shot 'em (BAA!!)
We're makin dollars overseas (uhh), nigga please (uhh)
Squeeze these cos we're gettin paid by the G's wit ease (word up)
We're blowin up your fuckin spot (no doubt)
Cos when you're hot, you're hot and when you're not, you're not
Now everybody be the nicest but Jesus Christ this
Is a crisis, I kill 'em dead with my devices
My advice is you better learn a trade
Before you kick a rhyme and end up fuckin gettin sprayed
I keep you open like you're fuckin sesame
You're just a pest of me, you'll never get the best of me
Cos yes I be, the K-to-R-A-Z-Y
Use to rock Fila, inventin like I'm Eli
Whitney Houston, your style in need of boostin
Your crew? They need a stomp, no comp, you know you're losin
I put my dues in so you know it's only right
I gots ta hold it down so all my niggas hold tight (hold tight nigga)

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
[Dray]
To the, aah, boom bang, my slang is mad thick
My rappin antics'll keep 'em runnin frantic
The shit the man kick'll make ya fuckin ass sick
I bring it from the pit and never quit cos it's the Krazy
Poppin all this shit cos these rhymers don't amaze me
It pays me to rock it so why I'ma stop it?
I make ya buy the bucket so fuck it, I stock it
It's just for safekeepin so when I'm sleepin I sleep safe
I'm comin with my Timbs in ya face (motherfucker)
Back in the place I'm gettin stupid in ya sector
I be the Krazy Drayzie, nigga check the way I wreck ya
Fuckin flow to the final, motherfuck a title
My nigga DJ Dice is on the vinyl (motherfucker)
That's my recital, kid I flipped it til the end
I bring it from the sewer, here my nigga come again

[Skoob]
The Books In Reverse kicks a verse
I'm takin it to ya face, I'm iggity on the case I pursuit
To stomp an MC like grapes and then scrape 'em with the boot
I bring swing to the ring like Lou Duva
Giggity-got land like a cruiser, Pop Duke, he whip a cougar
For pages I kick it raw til my jaw caves in
Amazin and plus off-beat like caucasians
Me get done? Never son, I hold it down for 718
Where niggas fuck around and where niggas lay
Ain't nuttin slim, I got game like Tim Hardaway
Fouls like the proudest so I'm louder than RCA
Aw shit, I got you buggin, flippin that shit that you lovin
Plus I got another back in the oven
Some heard the style and did construction on it
But they just touching on it, bitch ass niggas ain't got nuttin for it
Come up off my blocks or I'll blow ya spot
I rock like that bald-headed nigga on Fox
(So how we do?) No shorts from niggas or they fuckin girl and (what you got?)
More styles than Delancey got shearling (no doubt)
So if you wit me and you're higher than a hippie, hold tight
Cause e'rything gon' be aight! (No doubt)
