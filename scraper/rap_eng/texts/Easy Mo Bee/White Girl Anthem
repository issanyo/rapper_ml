[Cameron's verse only]

And it's getting abandon with my crazy girl Shannon and it's
About the old school, and looking like an old fool
Because you wanna look cool you're acting like a damn tool
Whose acting like he knows the rule, but acting like an old ghoul
But who's still in middle school and drowning in the swimming pool

But once you're up at that bat, you're just gonna fall flat
Looking like a fly cat, but always talking old chat

Coming like a bear claw, make you scream oh lawd
Laying down the common law, now you'll go through withdraw
White girl anthem, naw, just wanting to get some
