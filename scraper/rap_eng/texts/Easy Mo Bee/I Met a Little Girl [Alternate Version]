I met a little girl, sure was fine;
Pretty little thing just about blew my mind
She took me home, and, ahh, made love to me
I knew right then and there, this is where I wanted to be
Most of my life I had been all, all alone
And you're so sweet to me; don't think I'll ever roam
And then one day as time will pass
I had this feeling that our love would last

Nothing could go wrong, and it seemed everything I did
Seemed to please you; all the heartaches you hid
Then one night after we made it, and we were through
That's when I decided I wanted to marry you
Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife;
To love, hold, and cherish, for the rest of your life?
I do, yes I do, I do darlin'
Cause I love you

Nineteen sixty-four
Once you really loved me
Once I really loved you
Nineteen seventy-six
Then time would change you 
As time would really change me

We thought our love would stand the test of time
And, as I sing this song, right now, I wonder today, today
If you're a friend of mine
Cry, cry, cry, I have done some crying
Woman, you have caused my tears to flow
Cry, cry, cried; you cry about me?
Do you think about the kind of love we had?

I told you I'd do the honorable thing
Take care of you and the baby best I could
But times was really hard and I had to try a new way, a new life

Hal, le, hallelujah
Hal, le, lu, I'm free
Hal, le, hallelujah
Hal, le, lu, I'm free

But I wish you happiness and lots of sunshine
And a new life and a new love
Oh, this is my goodbye, baby
God bless you, baby
