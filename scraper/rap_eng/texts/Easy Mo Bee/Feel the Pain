[Verse 1]
Yes, yes y'all
I feel I'm a threat to high-powered MCs
'Cause when I roll up on their live shows they kinda freeze
From being approached by the Genius of rap
Whose poetry makes hands on a clock clap
You see, I be coming with strong rhymes galore
That even a stubborn MC can't ignore
That trying to defeat me brings about danger
Like a child speaking to a stranger
Soft MCs, I see more and more
With an ancient style, the prehistoric bore
Yes, they scream and roar 'til your throat get sore
Now you're running to the neighborhood drug store
To buy the cough drop, for what? The wrong hip hop
Now you swear you're on the good ship lollipop
But it's a sweet trip to the candy shop
Blaow! Now it's a six feet drop
For stealin' rhymes which is incorrect
Biting was the cause, death was the effect
'Cause the action affects reaction
There's more like you, yo, you just the fraction
Of those who speak on how others are weak
You wanna sneak peek of the hype technique?
Don't make me run up and start flipping like I'm insane
Or you'll feel the pain
You'll feel the pain
Feel the pain
Feel the pain

[Verse 2]
I appreciate your compliments of my creation
Your standing up followed by your standing ovation
Your kindliness to listen to the true MC
Those who know me make me number one 'cause they agree
I rock on and on past the break of the dawn
Ask Rakeem, Unique Ason or even Melquan
'Cause I be flowing, at the same time showing
Hard headed individuals who don't be knowing
That I wrecked it, 'cause my style was perfected
And injected into a drop beat selected
By who? Easy Mo Bee, the engineer
But don't forget the hypest in the Northern Hemisphere
The G, the- the G, the- the Genius
From Earth, not Mercury or Venus
Or Mars, 'cause then I'll be a Martian
But even in that world I'll still be squashin'
Brothers who feel they have the heart
To battle me, then I'll just trip them apart
Don't make me run up and start flippin' like I'm insane
'Cause you'll feel the pain
You'll feel the pain
Feel the pain
Feel the pain
