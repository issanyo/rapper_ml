[Verse 1: AJ 773]
I still ain't apologized for bodying B Rael
Made sure he lost, you can't spell his name without an L
I'm off that, no fuck that, comparing us a dichotomy
I grind like I'm broke, that Brandon Roy knee cap mentality
We making a movie, I just let a fine pair mount
Then let em drop it lower than Magic Johnson t-cell count
I got bars for days like a nigga told on his day ones
Fuck having the sauce, my blood practically A1
Speaking of juice, I'll make her drip em if she join the team
But yours full of Bishops and less Raheems
I got crack for you like Rick Ross in some baggy jeans
I come stronger than Precious, blue jean seams
And if you want an issue, a UA meeting where you find him at
Please don't get Kap G and I don't even need D9 for that
You celibate mcs probably couldn't even find the cat
If you want a one on one, goofy then I'm Kyla Pratt

[Verse 2: Simba]
I'm just a curly headed so and so
A silly wabbit or a dog with a bag of bones
Half flower child born from cracked cement
It's evident the boy been different
Fuck the opps and pray for opposition
I'm the spawn of that shit that Nas was spitting Karate kiddin' Miyagi the master living
I promise I got a sickness, I'm praying Jehova Witness
Simba the Poet,  you a motherfucker
I swear they hate to see you shine now you Cain's brother
I can't wait til winter comes, I can't wait to be the one
I can't wait to split the sun wide open
So I can be the biggest star
Who's the closest thing to God? Simba swear you so outspoken
But I am not a rapper, I am a professor spitting lectures to the pastors
Holy Casper

[Verse 3: Chino P]
Come at Chino P and you will get that clap back
I'm coming at your head like a motherfuckcing snapback
Flavor in your ear, flavor and it's near
Baby you can come and get this real flavor over here
Gold in this valley, shorty know she worth that
I'm just trying to put it down and show you where the work at
I got some shit you can bang your head to
I'm killing everybody if they got an issue
Flavor in your ear, this is my addition
I'm spittin' hot shit like it's paying my tuition
Aye Chino, this the girl that we know
Got niggas throwing passes like they name was Dan Marino
A queen of everything, a jack of all trades
I just gave y'all some heat like my name was D Wade
A rap grim reaper, you should already know
I put a pen to a paper and then it's murder she wrote

[Verse 4: Pretty Riot]
168 hours still no time for week niggas
Chasing a mil, I got plenty time for Meek niggas
Situations furry, but I'm out here like stray dog
Initials DM, I'm out here ducking macs and ARs
Shit made my heart colder than Chicago in January
I'm out here trying to get it, by any means necessary
Broken generation, you love followers, no one to lead
I could fuck the game up, but this is just a tease
I command the rooms attention, I ain't even gotta talk
Bitch savor my intelligence, and swallow my thoughts
I guess you mad cause some of y'all was just born faker
Be mad when my name beside an ex like divorce papers
Only get a sixteen, cause after that you gotta pay me
I'll never fall, but y'all emcees are more like Gwen Stacy
If niggas got paid to be real, y'all ain't getting pensions
Bitch don't call me dope, to you it's Ms. McClendon
