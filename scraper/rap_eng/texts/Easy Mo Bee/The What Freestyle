[Verse One]
I used to get feels on a bitch and now I throw shields on the dick
The ladies love this light skinned Spic
Uptown, young and back on my shit
I hop the A, 168th, a block away from the crib
Uh, New York City the illest city, that’s where I be
Where they stop and frisk and they lock you if you don’t have ID
We upgraded to Landrovers from Cherokees
We can skip the talking, my bitch is shopping for therapy
But closed mouths don’t get fed, my women talk a lot
‘Cause closed mouths don’t give head
We plead the fifth cause we don’t talk to the feds
Sneak dissing while you tryna give me dap like homie, pardon my left
(Yeah! E-M-I-L-I-O!) I give a fuck about ya
It’s like you eating escargot, they ripping slugs up out ya
‘Cause you a hater on the low and showing love around ya
Nah, let’s get back to the topic though, enough about ya
I told my people we gon’ get it and we finally did
All the pressure we was under made us diamonds and we shining this year
They be like: “Who is he, ain’t got no diamonds in his jewelry”
‘Cause if there gonna be blood in my necklace, it’s gon’ spill for me
Nobody as cool as we, we gon’ move in that new Supreme
And white Js with blue stains on ‘em from leaking through the jeans
The new regime, them cats is hot but they losing steam
Bitches hitting pause to get on and you thought your boo a queen
God damn, the game is crazy, ya shady hoes are making babies
To get the keys to a new Mercedes, a few done hated but that’s okay
Ay ‘cause we be on that matalo, matalo, ain’t no ole

[Hook]
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
‘Cause everything you get you gotta work hard for it
Honeys shake your hips, you don't stop
Uptown, go pack the clips, keep on

[Verse Two]
Verse dos, you know that we don’t love these hoes
Emilio the type of cat to leave your bitch exposed
Well you gon’ run with me ‘cause homie, I’m that cold
And in this world, it’s much better to keep close to your foes, right?
I’m well connected and well respected and living
Where the block is full of cats without papers that never fail the census
They using so many drugs that it done dulled they senses
Better than the thriving reality, it’s dull and endless
I’m always mentioned when referring to the best, kid
Accept it, utmost respect it, assume the position
Stop, look and listen, spit in your girl mouth before I even stick the tip in
Like welcome to my locale, ladies feel the tip right in they vo-cales
I spit and heat it up like it was So Cal
Surfing through this cold world, I’mma catch a wave
America the land of Free Masons that killed the braves
We still the slaves, ready to kill, why I act this way?
Because my pop beat my mom like he was Cassius Clay, yeah
So I never caught feelings for a chick, treat ‘em like a relay
I’m running through they whole clique and pardon me
I be flowing retardedly, no frontin’ in my raps
Ain’t no line about a car I lease, nah ‘cause we just tryna own
And have property before we getting old, yeah
I got more Glocks and Tecs than you, I make it hot
Cats won't even stand next to you, try and touch me
You better bust me tres times in the head or motherfucker's dead, thought so

[Hook]
