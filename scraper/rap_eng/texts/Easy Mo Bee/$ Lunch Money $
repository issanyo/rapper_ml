(BEFORE VERSE 1)
Let's go in...

Rest In Peace Craig Mack
Ima bring this back...
Cuz its Mac
Yeah....
(Infinity Boy!)
Yo yo

(VERSE 1)
I be too live
When I step up like it's break dancing
When Im spitting
I'm only riding with horses like Payton Manning
And that's until my voice get hoarse
Like I'm puffing blacks
Like Shannon
That mean I stay sharp
Like black keys
And if you hating
You can grab these

Ima need y'all to comb when you wake
And quit napping
So in other words quit sleeping on me
Like eyes that be baggy
I stay drafting
Synonym for writing
Don't make the wrong niggas famous for saying the right thing

I be the best thing that's came out my city
In a lifetime
And like it's daylight savings
Others blew up at the wrong time
Lost an hour then gained one at the same time
That mean that I simply be the answer like I'm AI
Murdering wise guys
Cuz real eyes
Revise
An image
By making em big they resize
They drug addicts with snake eyes
Tongue tied
With red eyes
And they say I'm cold
But I still bring the heat like a sunrise
Mac is amazing
Amazonian
Actually
Abstract
And the number one spot
Guarantee
Ima grab that

Take it Like I'm possessive
Assault with a deadly weapon
Head leaking he so aggressive
And I'm a lyrical felon

Back to the basics
When I make it don't say (*censor beep*)
Cuz when I needed support
You didn't lend me a tad bit
Ima kick you out
Of the concert like I'm an admin
Call security to escort you the way you came in

And now you back to hating
I got the ground shaking
And now you hiding under the bed
But I gotta take you
And Its crazy how you've been awaken
By the flows you've forsaken
This be that real message
Not an animation

Crazy
Now you giving support
But it's ironic how the only place they want us
Is court
And the only place the wanna see us ball is on the court
And if killing my people
Had a team
Y'all niggas would be the sport

Hardbody
So give me a beat to shit on
And metaphorically
I become a king like Creon
Brighter than Neon
Blowing gas like xenon
The machine on
Turn the screen on
Lyrical demon
I be in ya moms
Like how she be in Nissans
When she ask you who did it best
She gonna say De'Auan

Back on the beat
I get it
I get it
Then I leave
Leave it wrecked
Now you grieve
You waiting for it like Christmas Eve
They be hating but be Charmin soft
Claiming they G's
B's or C's
Not knowing they... A-B-C's
By my clothes you would think I'm a N-E-R-D
But don't T-E-S-T
Or I'll leave you D-E-A-D
Yeah...
It's not funny
These niggas on my jock
Keeping running
Ya wasn't there for the storm
So don't stay when it's sunny
Now I got the mic to yo dome so give me yo lunch money

Ya wasn't there for the storm
So don't stay when it's sunny
Now I got the mic to yo dome so give me yo lunch money
Lil nigga
