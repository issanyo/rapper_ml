[Intro]
Yo, yeah
It's that Queens shit, the real shit
Illmatic
It's the N-A-S, yes
Yo

[Chorus]
I wake up every morning
Thinking what we gonna do today (what we gonna do today)
There's got to be a better way (got to be a better way)
To maintain is the price of fame, life is like a dice game
Maintain is the price of fame, life is like a dice game

[Verse]
1, 2... I never knock a brother, I'm anti-jail for real
Smooth criminal skill, locked in a human flesh shield
Watching niggas get rich beside me
Pushing a 5 B-Y me up in the passenger seat
But I see me as Hallie Selassie in my kingdom
Sipping Asti Spumante, dripped in, reality kicks in
I need the papes to start clicking
Got a connect out in Richmond, ain't nigga in the fam will pitch in
It's on, word is bond, that's my name, big Nas, all wise to civilize
From the Northern Hemisphere of the earth
Peace to my seed and thanks for her birth
Destiny, that's her name
It's going on, you know my name
Big Nas in the house, y'all, on the freestyle tip
When I finish this shit, it's sure to be a hit
Peace, peace
