Intro:

Ha ha yeah, huh, uhh
Uhh yeah, huh, ha ha ha
Skunk hash in the house
Uhh uhh, skunk hash representin
Cess cess on the sack, uhh uhh

Verse 1:

Well biggity bang boom bamma, yo I be bustin my grammar like cherries
Niggas wanna follow but they know my style varies
I smoke like a fire and I drink like a fish
I be the rapper junkie gettin funky, never miss a diss (boy)
Now is it just me or is it you too?
But all I wanna do is spark a blunt and drink some fuckin brew (Me too
Nigga)
The weed smoker, MC provoker
No joker, my style be doper cos it fat like Oprah
Take a toke and blow the smoke like a dragon
Timberland boots'll keep my fuckin jeans saggin
Pour out my liquor, bust some niggas that we missin
It's just a tradition, the 40 keep me drunk and pissin
This ain't the mission, easy rider's got to go (c'mon)
We're only smokin phillies, white owls or optimols
We've got the flows that are better with every letter
I keep it wetter, niggas better get they shit together
Tougher than leather cos we're never goin out
So if you didn't know a nigga, this what we about (boy)
We about uhh

Chorus:

A 40 and a blunt (You know my steelo)
A 40 and a blunt (You know, you know my steelo)
A 40 and a blunt (You know my steelo)
A 40 and a blunt (You know my stee, you know my steelo)
*repeat*

Verse 2:

Ashes to ashes and blunt to blunt
See I fill em with thai or I fill em with skunk (punk)
I keeps it on lock but son I gots to come correct (what?)
The shit that I be smokin get'cha open like a Tek
Check the glaze in my eyes, no disguise
And I smoke so much boom that I should win a fuckin Heisman
I wise like the wise men
I buys ten bags for dolo (and yo)
Sick of niggas askin "Yo what up with K Solo?"
Well I'ma fuckin bastard when it comes to gettin blasted
If it's the hashish then fuck that ole two-in-passion
Cos oh my God, I hog the blunt like a boss
Baby sip the 'orty til the 'orty get me source
Get the quart, force it down with no shorts and no laws
When it's down to the spit like T La Rock said, it's yours
Just take a hit everytime a wack rap singer slips
So peep the cracks in my lips to the black fingertips
Nigga cos I crack you up like the Riddler (word up)
Plus I come to get higher than Hitler
Lay sessions with the skunk, keep my tape stretchin
From every section to niggas on lock in State Correction
So when I'm in your town at a club near you (aiyo)
If you got the bomb. motherfuckers bring it thru
How we do

Chorus to fade
