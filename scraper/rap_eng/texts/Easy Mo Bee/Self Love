Verse 1 : Nathan Baya
I wanna practice self love
But love has been defined as lust
Only self love I know is masterbation
Since I can't love me
Let me love you
And hope you love me
For me
Cause I can't do it
I feel stupid
All this love I got for you
But I got none for me
Is this love
Or an escape from being alone?
Nobody wants to be alone,  we want toxic relationship over singleness
I rather you single and happy
Than depressed in relationships
But how could you be single and happy when you can't be alone?
Misery loves company
That's why you keep hopping from relationships to relationships
Girls tryna change guys
But they end up being changed
By the guy and now she's in enchained to a guy who changes like the weather she know better but she don't wanna go back to being single so she tries to make it work that's not love that's work and this 9 to 5 gone make you die before you 35
Cause stress not healthy
Stress kills and it kills to see
You like this
Love healthy it should bring forth joy not destruction

Haha

This our battle with depression
Our choice of weapon
Self expression

Verse 2: Nathan Baya
I was home alone Kevin Macalistor
When I lost my innocence through the internet that's when me and God did disconnected and been trying to reconnect but ever since I been walking two paths but a man can't have two masters he must choose one and hate the other
My brother, my sister
Let go and let God
Come back to your first love
Hold up
Ladies don't get in a relationship trying to change him be with him cause you love him for who he is
You wanna help somebody help yourself to self love ?
Be with him cause you wanna
Improve him not cause you wanna change him there's a difference
Men don't confuse women
What you do to women will be done to your daughter
If you want sex let her know
If you want love let her know
If you want both I pray you marry her before you take the risk of making her a mother
Let go , Let God
Take control or self destruct
Woah, woah
