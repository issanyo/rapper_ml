[verse 1: Napoleon Da Legend]
A couple million dollar all I ask I want the bag
Just a savage you keep the fame I want the cash
As a youngin' was amazed by the glamours and glitz
The show business
The beautiful girls and gold diggers
The fancy cars and the mansion abroad
The crowd applause and the blogs
Bagging a thick amazon baby how bout menage
Pool parties with bikini hotties
Curves with a tiny body drinking a martini probably
Abu Dhabi Lamborghini rides
3 wishes for the genie in the bottle you gonna see me fly
Model chicks with the coke bottle figure how you figure
I became a king had to fit my whole vision inside a picture
Picture me rolling in a 550 ride with me they getting mad
Cause we don’t follow rules but why should we?
Always knew me as outcast couch surfing
Now I’m crowd surfing lock jaw this lady’s mouth hurting
Another day another couple hundred
I’m always up to something
I’m a find a way to get it yo!
I’m straight balling!

[verse 2: Napoleon Da Legend]
Penitentiary chances machievellian anthems
My pen and me we too advanced for these bammas
I set the standards for me it’s a just a way of life (that's right)
Give it up for all my soldiers and my a-alikes
Cruising at slow speed up the block drinking OE
Hit the spot and take a shorty back that's Easy Mo Bee
Take it further back my cool is "Mo Dee" a hooligan
Remember when I used to flow for no fee
That’s a no no, peep the promo it's photogenic when u snap it
Every bars life changing like bible verses you tatted
Publicized divorces with arbitrators
Carbon copy's who imitate us
Boys in blue try to intimidate us
Early morning waking up texting me baby u left me
Had to hit it quick and then I'm ghost thats mighty healthy
Grabbing that seltzer water mix it with something potent
We getting poured up missing meetings that's mad important
We straight balling!
