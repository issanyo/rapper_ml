Let these truths be self-evident
I got to put in work
You can see all of the evidence embellished on my shirt

I was copping pounds of purp 'for i knew that that was work
Popping molly with my white bitches
Eighty dollars worth
Sweating harder than a motherfucker
Who invented shirts?
Turn that fucking dubstep off nigga
Going to work

Ipod and a transpass
Nigga i was ass
Couldn't stunt if i wanted to
Smoking fucking grass

Now I'm outchea
Getting to the money that exists
Need james franco in my whip
Angelina in my crib

I'm that bitch
Hear them talking but not sure it exists
As of late i been on geeking cuz that lean got me on tip

I'm a bold bitch
Prolly smack a cop and kick his dick
But they see the real in me
They fuck around and still acquit

Convoluted and confusing but regardless i can spit
Verses intricate and delicate
Be careful with my shit

Hit my homies up in harlem
Told them i got flows on flows
Ain't never book a show but my face could sell out yours
Get a tour

Need more beats that i can't afford
Just to prove real niggas need to be put on more
Got that candy paint
Call it good and plenty, fuck the tinting
Buddha send me to annihilate
Hide yours kids and your remi

Ain't rapping 'bout my pussy
It ain't what got me this gucci or this fendi
Fuck them red bottoms, go cop me some jimmys

Been drinking this bacardi
Barely fucking see you
But them missiles got the trackers bitch
I wouldn't want to be you
Yo you see'thru

I don't know what your purpose is
You fetal
Wouldn't cross me either
Heard I'm just too lethal
Call your peoples

Woofers barking
Prolly louder than a biegel
No picks since the first day i became legal
I am beanie sigel when
State prop was relevant
My uncles was selling shit
Just got freed from doing grips
Ain't hug em since i was six

Real shit
All my verses classic
Ripping shit harder than a mastiff
While other girls be plastic
You say that you the baddest?
I'm the baddest around
See they talk the proper shit
But i been holding it down

You repeat the quotes
I study the literature
You think you a trend
Meanwhile chizzy was a fixture bruh

Peep game it's obvious
I am what the problem is
As in I'm the problem and the main one that they fucking with

Used to be ass
Forever getting passed
Now I'm balling
Anybody '96 draft
As in kobe, AI, nash
I been getting cash
Remember how they laughed
Remember how they laughed?

I want versace silk shirts with the works
Gold stitched
To flex on my old nigga and his new bitch
Sike naw
I got jungle fever i just might draw
Walk up to a group of nazi's tell them all
I like yall
Never scared

These bitches ain't prepared
Shot one in the air
They thought it was a flare
Peep game
I'm over here
So they run over there
I was loading lyrical choppers
They were weaving fictional hair

Goddamn who the fuck is shawty?
Shawty tall and popping
She from philly where it's chilly
In the summer she be mobbing
Modeling and working
Look the same in person
Wouldn't say that I'm a rapper though
Be conversing

I could take the subway now playing reasonable doubt
It made a lot of alterations to who i am now

It's been a very long day
I'm high as hell of this train semi-hoping i don't go the wrong way
All this stress to get paid
I guess it's natural
But if you taking mine that's a test to get sprayed
