Chorus: Das Efx & Mobb Deep

Miggity microphone master, funky rhyme maker
Miggity microphone master, and we the niggas making paper
Miggity microphone master, yeah about to get live
Striggity straight from the sewer and the 41st side

Verse One: Prodigy

The Infamous Mobb and Das now listen
Stick you for the only pot you got to piss in
Rapping school, keep the key in the ignition
When we get back nigga, we shine and glisten
Your seven do his thing with percision
No time for broke living, I'm trying to see addition
Food to fill my kitchen
So faggot kids snitch and give info, do a drive by in a stolen black Pinto
With tinted windows, bullets will flury through your system
Your man ran, lucky for him because we missed him
We catch him on the rebound but see now
We trying to get this money and you trying to stop me
What's it gonna be now?
You stand up to my crew and get laid down
On the ground with the big four pound, he hear the sound
On the other side of town, where caps get peeled
Break you off love love, give you something to feel
Das Efx, Mobb Deep, niggas holding it down
Runnin' fiction-ass MC's yonder-bound
Eager to please rap niggas get back smacked with pist-als
Forced to exile, back in the Nile

Verse Two: Dray

Well now ease up selector, I bring it on again
This is for all my niggas doing time up in the fucking pen
How y'all been? I can't forget my niggas who got left back, F that
And all my honeys chilling out in Lefrak
Sent this, we gets busy with no followers
Stomp you then you throw the towel up, make you roll the Owl up
Niggas mount up, it's the Infamous with the Sewer
Go to Queens and get my weed for one cent and got a brew, uh
Check one two ah, blew ya, out the box like Stella
Coming from the under with the thunder like Shelly
Really, we coming deep just like the Mobb
Nigga, rhyming is my job but you can wind up getting robbed
Anyway, in a day, or night it don't matter
It's me, that nigga P, Havoc and the Jibba Jabba-
Jaw, we bring it raw without a doubt
It's the Infamous and Das Efx here to turn it out

Chorus x2

Verse Three: Havoc

Ayo what you gonna do with that black deuce deuce?
Hit you up, take the cash, you ain't slug-proof, duke
Taking yours to survive, it's all a matter of time
I'm snatching, living grimey, running never look back
The root of evil got me acting like that
Life ain't a game, the streets is mortal combat
I wasn't blessed with the silver spoon
Since my born I was doomed, confined to one room
Now you's a customer, copping for natural born hustlers
That's what he thought, son, stupid kid you get extorted
Stop smiling, be still don't nothing move but the money
The Infamous gat clappers and mic masters

Verse Four: Scoob

Well fuck around and I'm a higgity hit ya with hickory diculous
Sick a niggas style, twisted off the liquor, bitch
I'll figure it's the Books, iggity off the hook
Holding shit down son, we keeping niggas shook, look
I got it made like Florence, fatigue garments
My man slipped up and got bagged for three warrants
Oh my God, the squiggity squad in the place
With the Mobb, niggas can get robbed like Base
Taste the terror for the leather in the Beemer
The Olde E abuser, can't fuck with Zima
The non-pop singer from the land of rock slingers
Where shit is hot and gunsmoke from niggas Glocks lingers
I rip shit for fun so come one come all
MC's will get mad, burned like Jamal
Live in my television from the cellar to the attic
It's the Books, Krayz Drayz, Prodigy, and fucking Havoc and it don't stop

Chorus x4
