[Intro: Mr. Cheeks]
Yeah
LB fam finally up in this piece
Got my mans that put me on, you know what I'm sayin'
Want a shout out to the Uptown, know what I'm sayin'
Word up
MCA, this is how we do everyday
Me and Freaky Tah, hah
Pretty Lou, my man, Spigg Nice
We be getting down representing
So this is how we go
Let me let you know
How it be
In da, G-H-E, double T-O
Rhyme name ho
They be runnin' shit down the line
Hey, if you hear a mistake - rewind

[Verse: ]
Who's the best, who's the worst in this here rap game
For those who claim to be the best
I tear them out the frame
I'm representin' puttin' Queens on the map (you wear)
Devil's Springs, with some baggy jeans when I rap
Come up with a style that they call versatile
Don't treat me like no lame, I've been in this game for a while
I've seen alot a-come, I've seen alot a-go
I've seen a lot a-break, I've seen alot a-blow
A yo, it's a trip to see a nigga slip
Get a grip nigga, nigga get a grip, geta
You don't even know the half of my crew
To be talking, but you're talking and you act like you knew
Yo set it, you fuckin' crossed the line and hit the border
LB fam start attacking some attacking outa order
Put on your leather gloves, and hats and get your picture mats
And get the gats just in case you take it to the stacks

[Chorus: Lost Boyz]
Shout out to the Jeeps
It's the Lex Coups, Bimas and the Benz (and the Benz)
To all my ladies and my men (my men)
To all my peoples in the pen' (in the pen')
Keep your head up
And to the hoods (the hoods)
East coast, West coast and world wide (world wide)
Ain't nothing wrong with puffin' on la (on la)
And if you're with me let me hear you say "Ri-ght"

Verse Two:

Nowa- Now- Nowadays
Niggas' fronting like they ill (like they' ill)
Now bustin' caps ain't got a muthafucking thing to do with showing skill
Recognize
Nigga, what' you fronting for?
I know your style
You've never hit a blunt before
Oh, you're just another in the race (man you betta stop)
Fakin' gats, takin' up space
To me you're nothing but a needle in a hay stack
Listen kid, I've been doing this since way back
In the day, Ace Deuce Tre, at the best
Up to Zimbabwe, hey, who's the best?
I want the best to come test me
So I can release some stress from my chest, G
Is you down to go pound for pound
Toe to toe, blow for blow, round for round
I'm wonderin' 'cause I bring the thunder and the rain
Causing confusion to your brain

[Chorus: ]
Shout out to the Jeeps
It's the Lex Coups, Bimas and the Benz (and the Benz)
To all my ladies and my men (my men)
To all my peoples in the pen' (in the pen')
Keep your head up
And to the hoods (the hoods)
East coast, West coast and world wide (world wide)
Ain't nothing wrong with puffin' on la (on la)
And if you're with me let me hear you say "ri-ght"

[Verse: ]
Keep the shit live for the year Nine Five
I got more niggas in my tribe
Than theres beez in the bee hive
LB Fam everyday stay high
Mr. Cheeks, everyday high
Concentrate to get my shit straight, make us wait
Before it's too fuckin' late
The Lost Boyz, yeah that's who I be'z wit
That's who I runs wit
Who I smoke Treez wit
Pack your bags, head outta town
I'll be back around so be gone before sundown
From Jamaica comes a nigga named Cheeks
With techniques of the streets
Over rough neck beats
This room is going bounce about the Cheeks can't remember
I'm the muthafucker choppin' crews like a chainsaw
Talk what you what ta
Do what you gotta
Well let me tell you something man you can't do me nadda

[Chorus: Lost Boyz]
Shout out to the Jeeps
It's the Lex Coups, Bimas and the Benz (and the Benz)
To all my ladies and my men (my men)
To all my peoples in the pen' (in the pen')
Keep your head up
And to the hoods (the hoods)
East coast, West coast and world wide (world wide)
Ain't nothing wrong with puffin' on la (on la)
And if you're with me let me hear you say "ri-ght"

[Outro: ]
Now, if you listen to my album
You'll see we only deal
With the real deal street life
