Verse One: J-Ro

And this is how we run it down the line
E-Swift is second, I'm first to rhyme
The bottle's half full, is it yours or mine
Get a cup and we can get drunk, at the same time
Put on your good clothes, when I come around
I'm all the way down like the brown brown I be kickin
Up in my town pickin up another pound for the weigh in
The Earth is a great place to visit but I ain't stayin
Don't stop like brakes to the metal
I brush my teeth with Amaretto (say what?)
I got that Operation PUSH, move from in front of me
I be the first rapper PMD seen, livin comfortably
In forty-eight states, light the board
I kick that kind of shit yo' ass can't afford
Cause you broke, you need to go for a smoke
And think about ya problems while you toke (ha ha)
Who you tellin, we did more shows than Aaron Spelling
Leavin Las Vegas likwid funk is what you smellin
This is the track that broke your moms back
I was on the dancefloor I heard it crack, do you like it?

Chorus: Alkaholiks

"Yeah" we bout to put it down like this aight? "Aight!"
"This is Likwidation from the West, one two"
"Yeah" we bout to fuck it up like this aight? "Aight!"
"Likwidation one two"
"Yeah" we bout to Likwidate the whole world aight? "Aight!"
"Likwidation one two"
"Yeah" the music get you drunk like this aight? "Aight!"
"Likwidation from the West"

Verse Two: E-Swift

Sometimes I rhyme drunk, sometimes I rhyme sober (yeah)
I never need no gimmicks and shit, to get me over
Just a couple crates to rock all fifty states
And overseas, nigga please, this is Likwid MC's (and they drunk)
Comin up like a feature presentation
While my Likwidation Liks be wettin the nation
On the two turntables I would say I'm nice
Destroy any mic device precise like Glen Rice
Prepare for the storm everytime we perform
We be the most inebriated MC's, ever born
That leave your speakers torn, it's Tha Liks
Everything we Liks is a classic, your shit sound plastic
Me bein wack is like no Latins in Manhattan
It just won't happen, long as E-Swift is rappin
So while y'all waitin for my crew to fall
I'll be chartin number one sayin fuck alla y'all
(Do you like it?)

Chorus

Verse Three: Tash, J-Ro

So while the MC's persist to try to bust like this
I'm so slick I drop the mic and jump back and kiss my wrist
Cause I mix words and match em, I chase words and catch em
The A in Alkaholiks stands for All About the Action
And that's the whole attraction to skip to my shit
Rock the mic in my palm beyond ad-e-quate
Shit split with the cheese and the H-O-E's
The ones I only call at night *keys jangling* you know my low keys
While downin Olde E's with the Likwid MC's
The crew that takes the party higher than the flyin trapeze
Then drops ya to the Earth without no safety net to catch ya
All y'all can say is Likwid wrecked ya, so let the
Good times roll, pass the glass and the Remi
To the nigga that's been rockin since Heavy D was skinny
And we can show ya how we run it down the line
(Xzibit: So how the fuck ya feelin Tash?) I'm feelin fine
But don't play me closely, just pass me that Olde E
And I'mma hit that shit and pass it down to Easy Mo Bee
Not askin you to show me, I'm tellin you to show me
The you know what, before I fuck shit up
Cause I'm CaTash the top gunner here to blow your ED
So you can see what I'm saying like Enhanced CD's
So if y'all niggas want the bomb press Tash Dot Com
And I'mma pop up on your screen with the beer in palm

And this is how we run it down the line
Tash came third, I was first to rhyme
Mo Bee Easy on the tracks that make you break your spine
Likwidation in your mouth one time, can you feel it?

Chorus (without words except J-Ro saying 'Likwidation')

Alkaholiks, yeah, the last hip-hop group left
Do you like it?
Easy Mo, Alkaholiks
West coast...

*E-Swift cutting and scratching*
