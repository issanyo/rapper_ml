'Brick, that's the name of my pit
Call that dog shit records
Brick records, no game of chess
Yall playin dip checkers
Bottle of mo no dough, but mo problems
Dangerous connection: you in ya boys ass with no condoms
Get back to research get clapped for free merch
Then cover the bodies with them fake Stetsasonic t-shirts
Watch me fuck this herb up from the curb up
To his fitted, sic my pitted on his bit, Kube chew that bird up
You speak real words but can't finesse this shit
And Rebel INS would ??? inspect this dick
Open your eyes, tell me what do you see?
Couldn't be E.C. so you do beats
For college hoops on the WB, and you fucking with me?
I have you clipped for a bag of D and I'm puffin it free
Pass around your mans' powder
Get your five fans louder
But your bitch don't say shit
Gargling Cage clam chowder
In and out her with a New York frank
Let's fight grandson
Your pops lotto dough got you looking like ransom
You think up long
Five months later got a linked up song
That sound like the vocals are synced up wrong
Check, never selling Esoterrible for boring gentle shit
Trying to eat off Cage like some nude oriental chick
You need a firehose to get that shit off of the shelves
Left a crumpled up rap trail lost in my twelves
Wishing death on me sounding like my ex ho
Wasted verses on haters, me and Copy collect those
Get milk to sponsor the "where's he been tour"
Came to the rap mecca and had to cancel every in-store
Went to Fat Beats hoping to blast a few clips
I had to put the ass back in Massachusetts
Daddy poorbucks got you fronting with his agents
Why you bringing up Pete Nice when you running with his cadence?
Tried to pull my dog's collar my dog hollered
Look at Richy Rich trying to fight a pit with his dog Dollar
Leaders of the Weathermen will clap iron
Like the Cobra Commander bucking Megatron out the Black Lion
