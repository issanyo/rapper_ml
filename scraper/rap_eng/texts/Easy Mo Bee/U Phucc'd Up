[Verse 1]
Now where the fuck where all that coke go
Stop looking stupid nigga like you don't know
Oh I heard you took the ho to the pokenos
With so much shit, they renamed her cokenose
Got niggas calling you and paging you
Been their before nigga, it's like déjà vu
But the niggas you owe, they owe some niggas too
Enough of the bullshit, they're coming to body you
Had too many chances, had too many shots
Niggas heard it all from the stick-up kids to cops
Now you in the [?], smoking bogey after bogey
Like they're gonna forget, nigga, you in some shit
Better get that money up before they chop off your cabbage
Better hurry up before the niggas let you have it
And that's what you get for trying to live lavish
Fucking up niggas' money, stupid bastard

[Hook 2x]
You fucked up and don't know what to do
You fucked up, got niggas looking for you
You fucked up and don't know what to do
You really fucked up this time

[Verse 2]
Nigga you knew better with that motherfucking cheddar
Trying to run around like you Cash Money Jigga
You're about to get your whole shit peeled
Your man getting stabbed and your bitch getting killed
Nigga what the deal, you better get your steel
I see a black car with four niggas looking ill
On the hill, shit's about to get real
Looks like you need the 9 mil', I got your back with the mac mil'
Stupid motherfucker got me in this
Fucking with you, I might get my whole shit twist
But we go way back to many hood crimes
We watch Janet play Penny on Good Times
I always had your back, you always had mine
You know you'd bust for me, you know I'd bust mine
Call them niggas back, tell them that they're dead
Or meet you at the Southside if they want their bread
Make sure that you got the full clip
And let the clique know that it just might be some bullshit
Send the tickets to the store for some henny and a raw
You fucked up, now we got a war

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now we're in the block drinking, getting drunk, playing with the guns
Look up and here they come, they come to kill my thun
Creeping, posting up on me
Niggas behind the tree, taking aim on one knee
They got me, they got the drop, I turned up, hopped
We lit up the block, when the smoked cleared, niggas were shot
I'm on the bench with the gat cocked, sizzling hot
Two thuns drop dead right then on the spot
Had to flee 'cause we heard the motherfucking cops
Niggas is dead 'cause you fucked up mountains of rocks
Skid out of here, don't want to see you no more on the block
You're exiled now nigga, better bounce now nigga
You fucked up
