Uhh, yeah, L.G., Easy Mo Bee
Brother to brother, put the Y2K on ya, check it

It's now or never, whatever, to stake my claim
Shake my pain, dodgin all these fakes in the game
Hate is to blame, bakin those with cake in the dame
Easy Mo the same, no competition, out the frame
This is more gold and platinum than them chains n thangs
L.G. and Mo is attackin 'em, the game's in vain
That bitch roll of you smackin 'em was just insane (sucker ass)
You got snitch niggas that run back, and crush your name
You hustle a lot, just like a rat, from the parkin lot
Bust a shot - you kickin raps?  Naw stop
What you don't want me to gave I already got
Property acres the lab the Ac' plus the queen spot
Once you see me drop this 100, miles and running
Blow me out the spot, not, but quite cunning
You're dumb and, young and restless, I'm makin you wait
I was givin you time to get the last one straight
Most of ya over, while I celebrate, like Sammy Sosa
Toast with Griff the Nation, soul survivor 'til it's over
I'm Hot like 97, the year's ninety-nine
Return like Makaveli but still hard to find
It's a conquest, so hard, but yet they still try
To defeat this black brother comin out of Bed-Stuy
I rebuke you like a devil, my head to the sky
That's cute, but not forever, don't ask why

[Hook - repeat 2X]
It's now or never - if you down, whatever
If not, stash your frown, pass ground forever
Mo Bee pound for pound, the sound is better
Mo beats in class clowns, no time for ghetto

It's now or never

[machine]
