[Intro]
Right right right right
Right, Busta Rhymes exclusive with the Zhané
Each and every day
We gon’ come around your way and do it our way, word is bond

[Chorus: Zhané]
It's a party, let's get it on tonight
That's how we flow
Gonna rock your body, we gonna do it right

[Renée Neufville]
When I step up in the party, won't you move it to the left
Party people move it side to side, I'm feelin' kind of blessed
‘Cause I'm so fly... and you're so fly...
Feeling high tonight... it's a partyartyartyartyahhhh

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
UHH! Let me get down, do my thing
I always bring, shit that always make your ass swing
Holding down the fort while we keep shit tight
Hit you with that bang shit that keep you live all night
Makin' moves strong while we keep rocking on
Now the object is survival, son, so get your hustle on
Bust two shots while I blow up the spot
I make it hot, ‘til the jam is packed, to the parking lot, now
Me and my mans feel like we astronauts
‘Cause we so high from off that weed we got from new lots
Certified stimulation got me open wide
Before we slide inside we grab the stash out the ride
We on fire tonight, and the place is looking steamy
Baby girl let me shoot that gift that make your cake creamy, uhh
Feel the heat circulating through your body
Every time the Flipmode clique step inside the party
Word is bond

[Chorus: Zhané]
It's a party, let's get it on tonight
That's how we flow
Gonna rock your body, we gonna do it right
[Renée Neufville]
The stimulation circulating through my mind, body and soul
Busta Rhymes, stimuli, making me lose control
And I'm so fly... and you're so fly
Feeling high tonight... it's a partyartyartyartyahhhh

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
I got my mind made up, c'mon, you can get it, girl
Come with me if you really wit’ it girl
Back to my dungeon shack, where the party is it
Where I can tickle your nipples and your feminine fat
I checks for you baby whatchu gon’ do
There's a party at my crib designed just for me and you
Let me let my crew know we ‘bout to break out
Flip, Star, Web, Dukwon Allah, and the Boy Scout
My man Black missing, son, whylin with the shorty flippin'
Stackin' papers, sippin' bubbles, good nigga livin'
But anyway we bout to break out in my Lands
Pursuin' our thoughts and executin' all plans
The dope shit is that we both understand
That it's a one night stand and you ain't even thinkin' ‘bout your man
Oooh, OH! We bout to turn on the heat again
Don't you say a word until we finish partyin'

[Bridge: Zhané + (Busta Rhymes)]
Don't you know that tonight, is your night
(Tonight is the night)
Feelin' good when I have a peace of mind
(When we got a little peace of mind, word up)
‘Bout to set it off and just a little while
It's a partyartyahhhhhh
(It's a party y'all, it's a party y'all, it's a party y'all, yo)

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Well anyway, I'm back around my way
Keepin' it live, you know how we do each and every day
Rollin through thick with my girls Zhané
With the exclusive debut ‘Hey Mr. DJ’
Listen to me baybay
We put somethin' together that's gon’ drive you crazy
Get from out your seat and stop actin’ lazy
Or get up out my party if you actin shady, baby baby
It's a party

[Chorus: Zhané]
It's a party, let's get it on tonight
That's how we flow
Gonna rock your body, Zhané and Busta Rhymes

It's a party, let's get it on tonight
That's how we flow
Gonna rock your body, we gonna do it right

It's a party, let's get it on tonight
That's how we flow
Gonna rock your body, Zhané and Busta Rhymes

It's a party, let's get it on tonight
That's how we flow
Gonna rock your body, we gonna do it right

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Let's do it right now
Keep it movin' y'all
Flipmode is the unit y'all
You can't see what we doin' y'all…
