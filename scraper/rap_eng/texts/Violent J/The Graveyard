I C P the wicked clowns and Project Born
Serial slaughtering motherfuckers in the graveyard

[Frank Nitty]
Tick to the motherfuckin tock
Nigga the clique from Project Born and ICP are here to rock
Nigga trippin in the graveyard
Bitch don't try to play hard
It will be your ass up on the block
When I start pullin cards
Cuz J will be the burier
2 Dope will be the carrier
And Project Born is sworn to put a bullet in your derriere
It's time to wake the dead the dead are movin and they woke up
A lot of souls and hope like what the hell will Nitty spoke?
Cuz I be dreamin I'm dead and gone
And on that fuckin truth ???
Mr. Nitty 74 to 94 took two to the head
Tryin to be hard will get you there
A nine milla mil will put you there
Punk ass nigga to do your hair
And six motherfuckers to carry you there
Suicide is certain best believe that I be hurtin ya
I'm puttin in work I do much dirt so call it curtains for ya
Bitches I'm a blast ya, no fuckin ever after
These punk ass niggas keep tryin to throw the casket
On the masta, I'm fasta
You should of tried to beat me to the funeral
I don't give a fuck , it's Mr. Nitty R.I.P.'n hoes
Come flesh get next from the brother on the boulevard
G-r-a-v-e-y-a-r-d bitch it's the graveyard

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Stompin through the graveyard been chillin here for days
Workin the graveyard shift diggin up all the graves
Sellin all the stiffs to the Dead Body Man
One came back to life so then I began to ran
The decrepit motherfucker was followin right behind
I don't know what to do, I think I'm losin my mind
Right then the corpse came jumpin out a tree
Way out a tree, and fallin on top of me
Back on my feet, a zombie in my face
Slipped my hands around his neck and tried to put it in a brace
But a nope, that's not how the shit goes
His head popped off and started nibblin at my toes
I got dead bodies to the right
I got dead bodies to the left
I done took care of one, but what about the rest?
Tie me up with some veins draggin me into the tomb
I knew I had to be doomed
Cause I can hear the loons in my head
Clear as day, echoin through my brain
Tellin me somthin's wrong then I felt the pain
They was snackin on my flesh by the pound
But that's what happens
When you be fuckin around at the graveyard, dawg

[Lil' Half-Pint]
Come to the graveyard now you see what's goin on
You scareder then a motherfucker shouldn't of brought your ass along
It ain't no place to hide, and it ain't no place to run
And plus I pack a bible, a shovel, and a shotgun
Now I'mma complete your funeral, ICP gon' drive the hearse
You think it's over now, but now it's gonna get much worse
Deadly's how I play the game, nothin else can fuck with that
See you on the corner with your gat, you better duck with that
The dead gon' come alive and decapitate your fuckin head
Now I gotta wake the dead, sleepin on the death bed
Mr. Nitty gonna dig a ditch, kill you and your fuckin bitch
I'm stealin for the broke & po'
Suck my dick you rich hoe
Your daddy got a job and he treat me like a bum
But I'm a let his ass know, he can come and get some
It ain't even shit to me, comin from the PJB
A Project Born assassin but the Feds be watchin me
Cause I'm diggin graves, graves is what I'm diggin
I can't believe this shit, this nigga still livin
So why you gonna play hard? I'mma pull your ho card
And I'll go slap your ass with the shovel in the graveyard

[Violent J]
My name is Violent J and I be sleeping in a coffin
Deep underground, never to be found
Then my body rots as I'm sleepin in peace
Cuz nobody dares to ever wake the deceased
But who is this motherfucker knockin at my tomb?
Disturbin the worms that are tryin to consume, my body
It better be somebody worthy, bastard
Oh, he he, it's the Ringmaster
Givin me orders to awake from the dead
My body is decayed I need to find a new head
And a new leg, but then I'll be straight
To crawl from the dirt, and put in some work
One o'clock one thirty, two in the morning
Wicked Clowns ICP and Project Borning
At the graveyard I got the whole wide world in my hands
Cuz I'm the Dead Body Man
Wicked, Wicked Jokers, Wicked Jokers, Wicked Fun
F-L-I-N-T and Southwest become one
And in the name of the dead you got dealt yet another joker card
Straight from the graveyard (repeat)
