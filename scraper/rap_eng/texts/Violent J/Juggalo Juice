[Verse 1: Violent J]
That precious sauce — Juggalo Juice
Crack that fat boy let it go loose
Drink it, spray it, whatever your use
Do it up like Joey, and Big Joe Bruce
Wet it up kid (I’m about to)
Moon Mist Blue here’s what you do
Throw it up in the sky to soothe that itch
Slap it up silly and boot that bitch

[Hook:]
Just let it fly — Juggalo Juice (Yep, yep)
Into the sky (Yep) my Faygo HEEY!!
Don’t wonder why (Whooooaoh!) Juggalo Juice (Yep, yep)
Until you try (Yep) My Faygo HEEY!

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Two in each hand, flake out and shake
My nutbag taste like Faygo Grape
Explode in your bedroom, Faygo lake
Marinate your steak and bake Faygo cake
It’s cheap as hell and fuck I’m broke
Fuck three bucks for a cup of Coke
Shit, I stay sticky – fuck the soap
Orange Pop all on my dick please though

[Violent J:]
I mix it, fix it, fuck I kicks it
Off them titties I got'sta licks it
Take out the fixtures, chandeliers
Fuck a venue too nice to handle this
Rock and Rye bounce from above
Knock you out and fuck up your duds
Explode and unload all over the place
You don’t like Red Pop? Fuck your face!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Too much juice shorts out the power
Dance in the dark of the Faygo shower
Sugar rain insane Flavors, colors
We’ll kick yo ass, but we love each others
Through the floor, into the basement
But it ain’t wasted, more we taste it
Seeps on through to the pits of Hell
And puts out the flames where the devil dwells

[Violent J:]
Faygo storms, rain and thunder
No need to wonder, it’s too much fun to
Just unwind, put yourself under
The trance, pour some down your pants
Hump it, hit it, get wit it
Bust a nut and be geeked ya did it
Precious Peach and Bubblegum Pop
No need for a mop cause we don’t stop!

[Hook]
