[Violent J]
If I had things my way, I wouldn't be a zero
Rather be respected like Pierre Ferro
Every album I touch 5 mics
Id be on MTV with Tommy Lee riding dirt bikes
Me and Fred Durst cooking bratwurst
At one of Hugh's barbecues with those bunnyskirts
I wouldn't need a barricade at my shows
Cause it would be nothing but celebrity friends the first 10 rows
I'd have a 90 pound slut on my arm
Who likes like a little skinny dude with a perm
But she's a supermodel and she works in Brazil
And her daddy plays polo on the isle of [?]
I remember when I met her at a party in France
I sent her a rose with a note "May I have this dance?"
Jugaal- what? I don't even know who they are
If I had things my way, I'd be a superstar

[Chorus]
I'm so famous I'm so sweet
I'm so delicate, unique
Call my [?] one time
I'm so fashion, I'm divine
I'm so famous I'm so sweet
I'm so delicate, unique
Call my [?] one time
I'm so fashion, I'm divine

I got a call this morning, Denis Rodman & Carson Daily
They want to meet me up for lunch at the [?]
And I don't even know them people
But we famous, so we consider each other equal
Where am I from? Oh yeah, Detroit city
I remember that tiny little town, so itty bitty
I think I used to have some family there
In fact I wonder if - hmm - anyway, Jauque do my hair
Sniffing cocaine off of crystal counter top
Kissy face, sucking on her ruby red lollipop
Shaggy Who? Watch me clean up the ghetto
I sleep on a mattress sprinkled with rose petals
Make my music, write my song ill come sing it
And when the royalty check comes, better bring it
Mr. masseuse come and rub me down gently
Mom, here's the keys, go and wash the Bentley

[Interlude]
Let me tell you I drove for that guy, I know him. I swear to God. We drove to Las Vegas, he gave everyone of us $1500 a day, just to piss away on the tables. I couldn’t believe it. This guy, he had so many women, he had an entourage of at least 30 guys in and off my damn bus all day long. I couldn’t believe it. Just every day, it was a new woman. Every day, it was 30 new people, you know? He had gold, he had diamonds, anything you want. I told him about my mortgage on my house: $80,000. I swear to God, true story, this guy gave me $80,000, said, "You don't have to worry about it now, cuz. I couldn't believe it

Superstar....

[Chorus]
I'm so famous I'm so sweet
I'm so delicate, unique
Call my [?] one time
I'm so fashion, I'm divine
I'm so famous I'm so sweet
I'm so delicate, unique
Call my [?] one time
I'm so fashion, I'm divine

I'm like a zerko, I suck my drummer's dick
I ain't gay or nothing, I just did it for kicks
I play the crazy rock star it helps my rep
You should've seen me at the movie premiere with Johnny Depp
I love Hollywood parties, I live like a star
I'll kiss your ass, even if I don't know who you are
I'll jump in your pictures and ill get in your way
I'm annoying as fuck, I'm like that one kid from Sugar Ray
Do I remember Twiztid? of course I do
Twisted Sister, They used to play with Motley Crue
Oh you mean them rapper kids that were down with me?
No, I don't recall, excuse me, security
I don't need old friends, I'm way bigger
Sorry, my phones ringing, its Tommy Hilfiger
Ill see u when I see if I remember who you are
After all, your talking with the superstar

[Chorus]
I'm so famous I'm so sweet
I'm so delicate, unique
Call my [?] one time
I'm so fashion, I'm divine
I'm so famous I'm so sweet
I'm so delicate, unique
Call my [?] one time
I'm so fashion, I'm divine
