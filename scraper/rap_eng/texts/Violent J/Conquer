[Intro]
*Laughing*
S-O-O-P-A

[Verse 1: Violent J]
I come flying out the sky on a jet surfboard
Shooting people with a laser gun, four points scored
I'm outlawed like al Qaeda
I bomb like jetfighters
I VILLY ON ME A SLEAZE
Superly set worlds on fire
And this earth shit is next, and I'm burning it down
When I look around, it ain't no fucking heroes in town
I don't work for that Devil shit
We kicked him out of Hell
We overthrew him, stabbed him with a cross
And cut off his tail
And so it's ours, we freed everybody
Now it's an army
Rotted bones or not, they headed back to they bodies
They coming out the graves
I do the splits like Prince
And shoot rattlesnakes out my fucking fingertips
I make the sky red with cracks in it
Give me a minute
Stand on top of the tallest building in the city
Like I did it, I'm a Soopa Villain
I got the whole world in my palm
I'm about to bite it, fucking eat it til it's gone
Call your loved ones

(Chorus x2)
You're world
(Right here)
We'll conquer
(Be scared)
Dark powers
(Voodoo wicked with the black magic staff)
No heroes
(Anywhere)
To stop us
(No care)
It's ours
(Once we take it we ain't giving it back)

[Verse 2: Esham]
The mighty flowa'
I cock the hammer like the mighty Tho..or
This games ova'
I took down your high scora'
Lyrical dictator like Fidel Castro
Quick to blast four more po-po then the time before
Soopa Villain make a killing
Multi-killionaire, pealing
Banana skins back, lear jet black
Take off, touchdown on a remote air strip
Hundred round clips, laser beam, Uzi bitch
Turbo chips and all whips
Got a monster grip on the planet
This madness you can't understand it
Its harder then granite
To take over the world exactly how I planned it
The coach who told the quarterback the play and he ran it
Touchdown, 7, the mack 11 sprayed 7
And jam, but still I got enough explosives in the place to blam
With the matrix in your face
Here we go once again
Trying to take over the world with the Soopa Villains

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: Anybody Killa]
This ain't your land bitch, it's ours, so I guess we taking over
Pistol packing, gun clapping, making warm bodies colder
Look over your shoulder, can you see my face?
Is there somewhere else you'd rather be then up in this place?
Well you can't, so just face it
The world's about to change
Go to sleep and pray to God that you wake up again
Do you see the sun light slowly fade away?
Day after day you erase your pain
Ain't it super that these villains are finally taking over?
As these haters keep on hating all these real ones ask for more
Ain't it silly that every time I light up a Philly
Everything I never understood becomes more clearly?
If you can't you need to smoke, look at the Earth from a distance
Take a big fucking hit for every time that you witness
Some fucking heartache and pain, going through hard times
A mothafucka just like me about to take what's mine
We taking over

[Chorus x2]
