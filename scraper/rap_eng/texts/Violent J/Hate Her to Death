[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
I fuckin' hate her to death
I fuckin' hate her to death

[Verse 1: Violent J]
She's incredible, unforgettable, undeniable, breath taking
Furious, she's so mysterious, I'm curious, Earth shaking

[Bridge: Insane Clown Posse]
She's always right every time
(I fuckin' hate her to death)
She gives me sight even though I'm blind
(I fuckin' hate her to death)

She's always saving my life
But she don't belong to me
She tells me things are alright
But she don't belong to me
I try to follow her light
But she don't belong to me
I feel her venomous bite
Cause she don't belong to me

[Pre-Hook: Violent J]
She's funny, she's shining, she's happy
I fuckin' hate her to death
She's caring, she's fun, she's smiling
I fuckin' hate her to death

[Hook: Violent J]
I want you off this planet
(I fuckin' hate her to death)
You don't want me and I just can't stand it
(I fuckin' hate her to death)

I fuckin' hate her to death

[Verse 2: Violent J]
She's unbelievable, unachievable, inconceivable, breath taking
She's incredible, unforgettable, unregrettable, Earth shaking

[Brdige: Insane Clown Posse]
I see her wings and halo often
(I fuckin' hate her to death)
I'd be happy with her in a coffin
(I fuckin' hate her to death)

She makes the pain go away
But she don't belong to me
She makes the awful okay
But she don't belong to me
She brings the light to my day
But she don't belong to me
And then she just goes away
Cause she don't belong to me

[Outro: Violent J]
She's smilin', she's happy, she's funny
I fucking hate her to death
She's smilin', she's happy, she's happy
I fucking hate her to death
