Bodies flyin to the sky and explode
People flyin to the sky and explode
Bodies flyin to the sky and explode
And then the blood rains all over the road

[Verse 1: Violent J]
I ain't never seen anything like my first day in the pit
I seen this lady tryin to hang on to some kid but no give
Hes loose straight up into the sky and completely exploited
And then the fuckin blood shower unloaded holy fuck!
Im trippin out i felt like i was gonna threw up
And then another ninja threw up and blew up im like fuck!
I tryed to call my mom i grabbed the bloody pay phone
But the phone bit my ear off and left a hole in my dome

Bodies flyin to the sky and explode
People flyin to the sky and explode
Bodies flyin to the sky and explode
And then the blood rains all over the road

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I seen a fella sittin on the curb payin nobody no mind
He was cryin like everyone else then he started flyin
I knew what was comin next so i ran and tryed to duck
But half his face landed by me bloody fried as fuck
People shootin up like bottle rockets nothin can stop them
Your starin at the floor catchin all them peices droppin
And its bloody bloody bloody it ain't funny when it rains on
Everybody body body body and your bodys fucked

Bodies flyin to the sky and explode
People flyin to the sky and explode
Bodies flyin to the sky and explode
And then the blood rains all over the road
Put your hands in the air like you dont care
That its fuckin rainin blood everywhere
Everybody put your hands in the air like you dont care
That its fuckin rainin blood everywhere
Everybody put your hands in the air like you dont care
That its fuckin rainin blood everywhere
Everybody put your hands in the air like you dont care
That its fuckin rainin blood everywhere
Everybody put your hands in the air like you dont care
That its fuckin rainin blood everywhere
Everybody put your hands in the air like you dont care
That its fuckin rainin blood everywhere
Everybody put your hands in the air like you dont care
That its fuckin rainin blood everywhere
