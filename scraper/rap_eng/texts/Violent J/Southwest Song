Southwest Song

"Good people sometimes think bad things
Good people dream bad things, don't you
Good people even do bad things
Once in a while, we do"

[Violent J]
Factory smoke and choke in pain
Cuz Delray funk is in my brain
So I break the law but I'm not to blame
You only know my place, you don't know my name

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Well, I grip the fence and bent the steal
And I steal a car and I grip the wheel
And I park the car then I steal it again
Cuz I really don't know what's happening

[Violent J]
I wait for night to fall then I walk outside
And then I run back in cuz I don't wanna die
You see, the air alone, it can corrupt your brain
As smoke fills the sky enough to block the rain

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
And I pray to God to help me justify
Look over me cuz my brain is fried
And I don't have a name, I don't have a home
I just lay alone on my bed of stone

[Violent J]
You see, death awaits me on my narrow path
And when I stop to think I can only laugh
Because I'm not alone, it didn't take me long
To see everybody singing that southwest song

[Hook (2x)]
Wooooooo Oh We-oh (Come on now)
Everybody singing that southwest song

[Violent J]
Some say I'm real and some say I'm fake
But I really don't care cuz it's all too late
You see, my mind is weak and I'm losing breath
As I crawl along I can feel the death

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Everywhere I go I bring with me pride
And then I pay the carny and I take a ride
But see, the wheel is wicked and it spins me death
So I try it again with what pride is left

[Violent J]
If we have to go then you can take me fast
You see, I started under and I'm sinking fast
And when the joker's card is missing from your deck
Then you know the road has finally caught my neck

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Eh, yo, don't look, now, there we go again
It's me and the grim reaper, best of friends
He's always hanging round waiting for me to die
We shot a game of pool, he's not a bad guy

[Violent J]
I feel him in the corner of a circled room
At about thirteen in the afternoon
And then I see the strain as I walk along
I notice everybody singing that southwest song

[Hook (2x)]

What does seem bad to you?
I'm angry...
What does seem bad to you?
I'm angry...
Everybody singing that southwest song

[Violent J]
If my time has come, then I'm ready to go
Shoot me in the face with your forty-four
And when I'm falling down to my sorry death
I'll laugh with my very last breath (hahaha!)

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Lose some, win some, that's how it goes
I've been down and out, I took many blows
And theres nothing here I ain't seen before
I'm just a jugglin juggla jugglin more

[Violent J]
You wanna see the world, you wanna run the town
You wanna meet a girl and wanna settle down
You wanna start a family and ya own a home
I wanna run with a set from the ghetto zone

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
You see the forks up, I see the forks down
But I'm a wicked clown, so don't fuck around
Cuz my brain is gone and it's on it's way
Of exploding, so get off me, dog!!!

[Violent J]
And I could be right and I could be wrong
And if I ain't dead now then it won't be long
But it does not matter what set you on
Tonight everybody sings that southwest song

[Hook (6x)]

"What seems bad to you?
Is hitting other kids?"

[Skit]
Daddy, Daddy! Look it's a clown!
A clown! Make him do something funny, daddy, please?
Ok, god damnit
Hey Bozo! Come here and do something funny for the boy
Haha Ok..
Hurry it up man we gotta be someplace
I'm not a very funny clown, but I'll try
Hey little boy, Hi
How ya doin'? I'm fine
Well that's just swell little fella
Hey I got a riddle for you
Ok, Ok
What looks like a ball?
It's shaped like a ball
It's round like a ball
But doesn't bounce like a ball?
I don't know, what?
Your Daddy's nugget! *Slice*
Hahahahahaha! Wicked!
