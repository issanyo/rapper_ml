Spread your wings, flyin over frozen mountains, crystal rivers, and geyser fountains
Driftin above China's mystic forests, float with the breeze across seas to shore
Deserts, cactus, and tumbleweeds
Irish meadows, and fields of green
Glide through cities of brick and stone, broken arrows of ancient Rome

Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Want you to fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me

Haunted woodlands, forbidden trails
Dust devils, caves, and OK Corrals
Through castle halls, under water falls, pyramids crumble when nature calls
Sky were blue become black with stars, lighting bugs kept within jars
Sand moves quickly through the hour glass
Wings spread, we can all fly at last

Everybody come and fly away
You must believe that you can fly away
Spread your wings and come and fly away
Just believe and you will fly away

Rock will melt, coal crystalize, clouds with skylines materialize
Wings spread take flights over northern lights
Wolves howl over blood red moonlit nights
Kings and queens within our dreams, the sky rains diamonds a ruby ring
Oceans, rivers, lakes, and ponds, lions, in the cold brr's along

Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Want you to fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me

Muslims travle to the land of Mecca
Atlantis, hidden deep under forever, Iceland golden tombs of pharoah kings
Rainbows sprinkling diamond rings, voices cryin out echo carries
Angels dance with the cryptic fairies
Gates of afterlife open swiftly
Stay if you wish, or come fly with me

Everybody come and fly away
You must believe that you can fly away
Spread your wings and come and fly away
Just believe and you will fly away

Open your imagination, beyond anything concievable, allow the unbelievable to take control of your soul, levitate three feet above ground level, three feet above ground and rising, allow yourself to raise and amaze, drift higher and higher into the moon's raise

Everybody come and fly away
You must believe that you can fly away
Spread your wings and come and fly away
Just believe and you will fly away

Everybody come and fly away
You must believe that you can fly away
Spread your wings and come and fly away
Just believe and you can fly away

Everybody come and fly away, (FLY WITH ME)
You must believe that you can fly away
Spread your wings and come and fly away
Just believe and you will fly away

Everybody come and fly away,.
You must believe that you can fly away
Spread your wings and come and fly away
Just believe and you will fly away

Spread your wings and come and fly away
You must believe that you can fly away
Spread your wings and come and fly away
Just believe and you will fly away
