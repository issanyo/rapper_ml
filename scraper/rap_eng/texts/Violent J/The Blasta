I was maybe 13
They was hurtful and mean
Specially this one fucker, Kurt Greene
Fucked with me in the hallways
Always
"Abuse the loser!"
They would all say
I walked in the lunchroom
I'm getting punched soon
If Kurt Greene sees me, here comes doom
This time he spit on the back of my head
My face turned red as the laughter spread

Daddy has a gun in his closet
Way up in a black box
It's too bad though, because he locks it
Along with all of his crack rocks
(Fuck it)

Ice pick in my hand up early in the AM
Kurt's at the bus stop snuck up one plus
Stuck him in the temple, simple disaster
That was the debut of the bully blasta

You fucked with the blasta (Explosions)
'Till he does what he has to
You fucked with the blasta
You don't know me
Till he does what he has to
You fucked with the blasta (Explosions)
Keep fucking with the blasta
You fucked with the blasta
You don't know me
Keep fucking with the blasta

I was 22 and the army's calling
I'm lifeless out here so I'm all in
And my drill sergeant is barking orders
And I'm sharing my living quarters
With a big-time prick from Oklahoma
I can't stand him or his aroma
Big thick neck jock in his drawers he flexed
They all kiss his ass, they don't wanna be next

I never thought the blasta would be back
But he has to we need that

He pissed in my bed, I jumped in
Laid wet in the laughter, blood pumping
He snores like a bear but tonight was nice
We all slept like babies with his windpipe sliced
I did it, with a straight blade razor
And my bully blasta behavior

You fucked with the blasta (Explosions)
'Till he does what he has to
You fucked with the blasta
You don't know me
Till he does what he has to
You fucked with the blasta (Explosions)
Keep fucking with the blasta
You fucked with the blasta
You don't know me
Keep fucking with the blasta

Years pass

I got a family now, I put it all behind me
My son gets picked on now, and it reminds me
Of murder, the bully soon came up missing
I spoke to my son I had an intuition
"Did you have anything to do with this?"
He gave me no answer just a hug and a kiss
And said "Don't worry dad everything will be fine
Just you pay it no mind, it's all over"

And at work my boss is a bastard
He comes to the office halfway plastered
Bitchin abusing all the women and testing
But we accept it because of the recession

He groped my wife at the office party
I stood up for her he swore he'd fire me
I threw him off the balcony 13th floor
I guess I'm a bully blasta forevermore

You fucked with the blasta (Explosions)
'Till he does what he has to
You fucked with the blasta
You don't know me
Till he does what he has to
You fucked with the blasta (Explosions)
Keep fucking with the blasta
You fucked with the blasta
You don't know me
Keep fucking with the blasta
