"It Don't Matta"
[Monoxide]
It don't matta no more
They gon' do what they gon' do
Even if I try to go
They gon' try to go there

[Madrox]
The game is unreliable
Broken down so many times
That it's unrecognizable
This is just the way I'm feelin
I refuse to lie
Do it like we do it and we do it til we die
And we're not dead yet
Why you mad and upset?
Me and my brother now a fixture
Make a man disrespect
Don't cha get the picture?
If you don't, disconnect
From the media, the television, and the internet

[Monoxide]
Always got a lot a shit ?

[Madrox]
But we're given the opportunity to speak
So we treat it like a mirror when we reflect in the streets
Don't matta how we spit it or get it inside your earlobes
From the record store, radio, and digital download

[Monoxide]
[Chorus]
It don't matta no more (No more)
They gon' do what they gon' do
Even if I try to go (Let's go)
They gon' try to go there (Come with us)
[x2]

[Monoxide]
I don't really like it when they try to tell me what I need to be doin and everything that I'm brewin I'm gonna ruin
(Ya'll no better than me)
It's all a ?
Whether or not, she wanna get hot
Connect dots and take shots with us
Through internet and tv interviews
With ?? scared to let the phone ring
So I stay in like a dream
And when the night falls I come crawling like hauntings
Hate me cause you ain't me and everything we do
We do it with the upmost and greatly
Hate me with a ? and distrust
Cause some dumbfuck listen to whats his nuts
Cause there's a bad apple in every bunch of ammo
Scrape 'em off like the bust of an '85 Camaro
You're gettin' off and you like
But lookin' for bone marrow tends on makin' a difference
Get with us

[Madrox]
God damn, you can't worry about what other mother fuckas do
You just gotta do you
(Ya'll no betta than me, ya'll no betta than me)
And all you really can do is just do you

[Monoxide]
It don't matta no, no, no
It don't matta no, no, no
(Ya'll no better than me)
It don't matta no, no, no
(Ya'll no better than me)
It don't matta no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
It don't matta no more (No more)
They gon' do what they gon' do
Even if I try to go (Let's go)
They gon' try to go there (Come with us)
[x2]

[Monoxide]
How can I be living a dream
Where the people playin the same game
Makin a nightmare for me
And it's cool but I've been makin a scene
I've been living a lie and it's gettin harder and harder to get by
So I try, to fly high, during the night time
Hopin' I can find the less of the same kind
I can't rewind the tape but now I'm ready to make my life change
Hopin' I picked the right day

[Madrox]
You know, out of mind, relentless, corrupted, outta my love, I'm defensiveless, attracted to ?
Like an addiction
That same far opporunity to overrun my extinction
Say that I'm weak minded, calling me not strong
Cause they wanna stand still watchin me move on
I pose new threat to the immortal greatness
They can rub it in my face on multiple occasions

[Monoxide]
[Chorus]
It don't matta no more (It don't matta no more)
Even if I try to go (It don't matta no more, come with us)
It don't matta no more (It don't matta no more)
Even if I try to go (It don't matta no more, come with us)

It don't matta no, no, no
It don't matta no, no, no, no, no
It don't matta no, no, no
It don't matta no, no, no, no, no
