[Hook]
If I was, if I was, but I'll never be
If I was, if I was, but I'll never be
If I was, if I was, but I'll never be
If I was, if I was, but I'll never be
If I was, if I was, but you're killing me
If I was, if I was. but you're killing me

Ocean of juggalos
If I was Andre The Giant "This is how I'd be talking"

If I was a stop sign I'd just be like "Stop"
If I was your wooden leg I'd still be giving you the hip-hop
[Chorus}
