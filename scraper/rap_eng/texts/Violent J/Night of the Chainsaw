[Verse 1: Violent J]
PCP, meth, mad anti-depression pills
Everything spills into one pot
On top of that I smoke rock
I hear that shit, but I won’t stop
Last time on the spot choked a cop
Stopped and had a Faygo soda pop
In the back of my truck, Chuck the chainsaw
Usually chop wood, but that ain’t all
It’s a bit strange all up in your mid-range
Cut a hole in your head ‘till I hit brains
Left a cop in the pile while maybe
It’s the night of the chainsaw baby

[Hook]
Cut ‘em up Chuck (somebody)
Cut 'em up Chuck (get bloody)
Cut 'em up Chuck (go nutty)
Cut 'em up chuck (go)
Cut 'em up (go)
Cut 'em up
You, can’t, calm me down x4

[Verse 2: Violent J]
Petroleum, inhale it, and take a swig
Heat my brains up, bake my wig
Killing time, with no shirt homie
I love it when the blood squirt on me
Walked up to a house, jabbed the door
And kicked it in, my victim hid
Stuck Chuck in the closet
And I can tell by the deposit, I got my target
French poodle, stomp it limp noodle
Rev Chuck up and stir the strudel
Guts on the lawn, fuck’s going on?
Chainsaw Chuck ‘till the break of dawn

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Violent J]
Bloody feet, no shoes, into a party
I wasen’t invited, but that bitch ignited
I screamed and laughed, chopping fools in half
I stab and hack, a mad lumberjack
Smell that fuel, hear the machine
Chucks a demon, I must be dreamin'
Bloody showers, feel the power
We devour you fuckin' cowards
A loony loose, Chuck full of juice
Beggin’s no use, I knows no truce
It’s yo noose about to see your own produce
Night of the Chainsaw written by Joe Bruce

[Hook]

[Outro]
You, can’t, calm me down (I’m so high) x4
