I paint my face every year all day
The 31st ain't nothin to me, another holiday
All of a sudden face paintin's in style
And I've been doin ever since Gilligan's Island was on
But try to live all year though
Try pickin up a chick when your painted up like a wierdo
Im 68 years old I still trick or treat
You think I care? shit I'm trying to find somethin to eat
And tell your old ladies to keep your pennys
If it ain't above a quarter, don't even bother
Im sick of these little kids to I know you did it
Put a brick in your bag and hit me in the head with it
And then they take my candy and diss
"look what I got from the fat guy painted like kiss!"
All year I'm a psycho uh huh I see
But every halloween, you wanna be me!

Theyyyyyyyyy
Every halloween
They want to be meee
Theyyyyyyyyy
Every halloween
They want to be meee

A gorila, a buffer fish and a bag lady
All made love and had a little baby
And supposedly I'm the one
But at this point thats only purely speculation
On halloween people smile at me
The rest of the year, they dial the police
They kick me off there lawn and shoot me off there cars
But on halloween there giving me candy bars
Trick or treat it's 5:30 in the morning
Im still out..im standing on your lawn
And I'm lookin through your window
*tap tap* I see a gummy bear on the table, ya gonna eat that?
My paint don't come off, and if it did
You think I'm scary now, shiiit
I look like frankenstein thats been slaped with ugly
Yet children hug me on halloween

Theyyyyyyyyy
Every halloween
They want to be meee
Theyyyyyyyyy
Every halloween
They want to be meee

3 6 4 people hate my guts
On halloween though, they wanna ride my nuts
They dress up as monsters, freaks, and clowns
And pass jelly bears, goobers, and suckers around
They next day when I try to trick or treat
It's get off the porch or i'll call the cops you freak
I don't understand you people but that's ok
I'll see you all next time you try to be Violent J

Theyyyyyyyyy
Every halloween
They want to be meee
Theyyyyyyyyy
Every halloween
They want to be meee
Theyyyyyyyyy
Every halloween
They want to be meee
Theyyyyyyyyy
Every halloween
They want to be meee
