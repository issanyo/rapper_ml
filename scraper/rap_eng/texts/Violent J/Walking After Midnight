I’m fuckin walkin
I’m fuckin walkin out in the moon light
After midnight searching for you

[Boondox:]
Out After midnight searchin lerkin hurtin howlin
At the fuckin moon I watch the neighbors closing curtains turning
Out the porch lights and I don’t even know why
On a stroll all alony like nobodies gonna die
I’m just looking for the answers to the questions that im asking
More lost then when I started darted
This means that time is passing barely grasping
To the moment and irrational thoughts
And this prescription in my pocket got me feeling distraught
Its just a matter of time I feel my brain is growing vacant
What the fuck is going on I’m like an old timers patient
And this situation it seems like déjà vu
I wish I had an explanation and I pray I knew
How I got to where I’m going what I’m trying to find
Looking for my sanity but I lost my fuckin mind
No where to be found I think I need some fuckin help
Walking after midnight and I’m searching for myself

[Chorus:]
I’m fucking walking (fucking walking)
Out in the moonlight (through the darkness)
After midnight (hay)
Searching for you (I’m trying to find you)

[Violent J:]
Right foot over left
Left foot over right
I let my dog out to piss in the middle of the night
In my backyard illuminated by the moonlight
Was a women in the haze and from the back she’s looking tight
Worry not he don’t bite but why are you in my yard miss
She waved me on to fallow and then ran into the darkness
All I had on were slippers still a gave a chase
Fallowing an angle and I have yet to see her face
With ease she passes through trees her gown blows in the breeze
I’m slapping though puddles and scratching up my knees
Please tell me your name and where the hell where headed
To the cemetery where the answers are imbedded on her tombstone
She’s home
She stopped running
I finally caught up and was about to ask something
When she turned around a demon
A snake for a tongue
And it bite me food for the dead I’ve become

[Chorus 2x:]
I’m fucking walking (fucking walking)
Out in the moonlight (through the darkness)
After midnight (hay)
Searching for you (I’m trying to find you)

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
What’s ding-a-linging nothing in my drawer
Chasing after that dragon but not the hara boy
Its big and shinny and dripping with blood
Why’d I do
Because I said that I could
Now my only problem I’m looking for that tool
When I hit him with it all I seen was dripping n drool
But I put it somewhere
Where
We can all guess
The simple fact is I blacked out and slit her neck
Back to the problem at hand
Memories of motherfucker wit him looking for that murder weapon
If I had recollection I wouldn’t have to sweat police
Now my drawers are open sweating trying to find this piece
I can't miss it if I see it wooden handle shinny edge
Shredding it every angle as if I jump off a league
Picking through the leaves digging through the dirt
Hiding every breath I’m talking I’m gonna make this shit work

[Chorus 2x:]
I’m fucking walking (fucking walking)
Out in the moonlight (through the darkness)
After midnight (hay)
Searching for you (I’m trying to find you)

[Repeats:]
(hay)
