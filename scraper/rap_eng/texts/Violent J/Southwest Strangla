Ahhh, make way for the lunatic
I wanna stop, I try, but I can't quit
I want necks 2 or 3 maybe 4
To squeeze again, and again, and squeeze some more
Where you goin? Walkin down the Boulevard
Jenny's good, she makes my nutsack hard
I don't know, what about my mental state
They might find a bitch dead, floatin' in a lake
Hey babe, jump in toots. Hungry?
Well, I got some nuts
Oh shit, she's suckin on my wang
Then somethin goes, snap, bang
SQUEEZE bitch, ha ha, die
Her neck long, skinny like a french fry
So I twist, turn, tangle then I strangle
Cuz I'm the Southwest Strangla

I want necks, long, tall, skinny
Any ol' necks at all, if any...
Jenny, Penny, Cindy, Sue
I want, necks so I go to the zoo
I choke a pelican, I gets wreck
I choke an ostrich long ass neck
But I'd rather be chillin at the prom
I pick up my date, I get to meet her mom
Hello Miss, I'll have her home quick
All I wanna do is choke her neck a bit
Worry not, I bring the corpse back
I just wanna hear a neck bone snap (uhhh)
Why me? Hey I'm sweatin
Convulsion, delusion, confusion, psycho
All I wanna do is kiss you good-bye
Before I mangle ya
Cuz I'm the Southwest Strangla

I got the south side scared, cuz I'm weird
I was a freak in the 2nd grade I had a beard
I sit alone in the back of the art class
And draw necks with a big red wet gash
I never thought I'd be a lunatic
A disgrace, I dropped out a mental case
I quit school, but I never left the hall
I grab kids and drag 'em in between the walls
Hear 'em scream, echo through the gym class
You hear me chokin bitches up in the vent shaft
They call me the Ghost of the Bad Lands
But I'm really just a killa with big hands
Allow me to squeeze your neck dear
Until your brains pop dead out your fuckin ear
Bury ya in my back yard with a twisted spine broken bones
...Cuz I'm the Strangla
