[Verse 1 - Anybody Killa]
Retalition is a must, watch your back, stay on que
Should've never fucked with us, now you got me after you
Devious and beady eyes, quick to jump and take your life
What the hell you think this is? ain't no way you walkin' by
If you see them, let them know just how far you lettin' shit go
You fuckin' with some OG's, Detroit weirdos
We bombin' on whoever dirty situation chasin'
And makin' you fuckin' bleed, put you on a permanent vacation
Hammer time on your face with my right boot
For loose river dance, do the jit into a spongy spit
My homies Twiztid got you listed
Have you all hemmed up like "What the fuck is this?"
We bigger than you thought, the whole crew be representin'
Pistol whippin all haters, have 'em twitchin' and flippin'
Retalition, beat 'em down, call up all the fellas
We been known in the hood as some eye ball swellers

[Hook] -x4
Retaliate
Hunt 'em down
Get 'em where it hurts
(Retaliation)

[Verse 2 - Monoxide]
I'm in the back with the windows cracked, I heard shots
Somebody on the side of me, bitch I ain't Pac
Give me a second to shoot back
And I just happened to be smokin' a blunt and got the hops in my lap
Now I'm pullin' up behind you
Steady tryin' to hide out in traffic, but you know that I'ma find you
Blind side you, scared to death
Keep shootin' til I burn up all the skin on his chest
God bless the dead
Go against me and you'll rest up in a bed with a hole in the head
Don't fuck with me, it ain't worth your life
It ain't worth watchin' your moms die tonight
If you start it I'ma finish it, diminish it to nothin' but rubble
And you just opened a trunk of some trouble
It's Monoxide and Killa, roll it up and relax
Retaliatin' on you bitches, watch your back

[Hook] -x4
Retaliate
Hunt 'em down
Get 'em where it hurts
(Retaliation)

[Verse 3 - Jamie Madrox]
Ain't nobody playin' bitch, this ain't no motherfuckin' game
You fuck with ours, you ain't never gonna be the same again
Leave you chillin' in a wheel chair, K chopped your legs from knee down
Now who you gon' see now?
You touch ours, get touched back with force
Anywhere you at it's on, of course
We don't sleep at all, give all my homies a call
Everybody in your crew is sure to fall
(Sho Nuff!) Retalition in effect
Fuck wit ABK and my brother you get a rusty shovel all up in your neck
Use the same weapon to bury that ass in the ground
So don't play hard, put your piece down or get peaced out
Don't be starin' like you gon' do shit
Without your weapon and your mouth, bitch you're useless
My crew gets pissed the fuck off
At all these mediocre thugs, claimin' to be hard When they soft

[Hook] -x4
Retaliate
Hunt 'em down
Get 'em where it hurts
(Retaliation)

You ever think about death?
You ever look death in his eyes?
