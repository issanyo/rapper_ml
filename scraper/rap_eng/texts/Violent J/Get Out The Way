[Intro]
Step, Step To The Side x3

[Verse 1]
Get out the way, if you're afriad to burn a freeway
Get out the way, if you're afraid to pierce the sky
Get out the way, if you too slow and need some leway
Get out the way, if all you've got is you try
Get out the way, if we've got the same agenda
Get out the way, if you don't slow down or stop
Get out the way, if you can't live forever
Get out the way, if you the one at the top

[Hook]
I'm comin!
Get out the way!
I'm comin!
If you can't live forever (Step to the side)
Get out the way!
I'm comin!
If you can't live forever (Step to the side)
Get out the way!
I'm comin!
If you can't live forever (Step to the side)
Get out the way!
I'm comin!
If you can't live forever (Step to the side)

[Bridge]
I can do anything imaginable, it's all mine
I take advantage of it, shit is all fine
Shine all the time
Climb on the grind
And if you lead the way
I'm comin' from behind

[Verse 2]
Get out the way, if you the one in my position
Get out the way, if you be dull in my shine
Get out the way, if bein' in ain't your ambition
Get out the way, if you don't stay in your prime
Get out the way, if you ain't got no audience
Get out the way, if you some kind of distraction
Get out the way, if you the one that's above me
Get out the way, if you don't know and ain't askin'
