Many throughout the unraveling of time have obtained shreds of strange prophecies
Prophecies that speak of a world along side our own
One uneffected by the plane of man
The prophecy is one of many come from an entity known here in our time as Ouija Macc
Seemingly demonic
Hardly empathetic
He is believed to be the evolution of a soul taking from an infant child playing with a Ouija board that was raised by both angels and demons in a place that is neither here nor there
His hybrid soul is has taking host in the bodies of Man and Woman and left clues from an alternate dimension from thousands of years
But that the thing is

It isn't a child any longer

It is a force
It has discovered a gateway

What it holds remains a mystery
But the prophecy suggests that we are in hell and have been dammed to a negative plane of existence


But it also suggests that there is a way out
With a formula
