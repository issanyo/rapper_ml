Skitsofrantic, don't panic
Leave me alone, get the fuck on
Skitsofrantic to the bone, when I'm home
I hear people walking in the other room
Cooking up chicken, chilling in my kitchen
Try to drive home, someone's in the back
Whisperin words, breathin on my neck
Flickin my ear, I know they're right there
But I can't see em in my mirror, uh
Laying in my bed, I'm better off dead
They're trying to figure out a way to cut off my head
Hiding under covers, they're trying get me
But I can tell one of them is under there with me
I got a phone call, I can't pick it up
Can't do a thing, just let it ring
Cause if I do, the phone will explode
I think I better leave him on hold

(Chorus)
You're skitsofrantic, don't panic (X4)

I better just chill, bitch get real
I know you're trying to poison my meal, I know the deal
You want me dead so that you can get paid
I ain't gotta dime, so don't waste your time
I gotta kill them or they'll kill me
Who's these guys trying to walk down my street
He's got a mail bag, he's probably just frontin'
I'm a give his ass something, motherfucker
The man next door try to take me out
So I set a pipe bomb and blew up his house
Here come the cops, I don't know shit
How do I know you're legit, bitch?
I hate to say it, but fuck Mort Crim
Cause I can tell, he's just one of them
Every night I see him on my little TV
He's always looking at me, why?

(Chorus)
You're skitsofrantic, don't panic (X4)

Sittin in my room, everything's dark
I think I heard somebody fart
Now how can this be, ain't nobody home but me
And somebody's trying to turn the key, hello?
I'm losing my mind, fuck all you hoes
Pulled out an axe and take off my clothes
Paint my face like a wicked clown
I'm down, straight skitsofrantic

You're skitsofrantic, don't panic (X13)
Hey, hey, hey
You're skitsofrantic, don't panic
Hey, hey, hey
You're skitsofrantic, don't panic
Hey, hey, hey
You're skitsofrantic, don't panic

No, you ain't getting none, bitch
This shit costs money
Oh, hey hey, kiddies
How are you liking the ride thus far?
Excellent
This next one is about that shit
That comes out of the sewers and pipes
And chokes your neck
It's called the Smog
Ahahahahaha
