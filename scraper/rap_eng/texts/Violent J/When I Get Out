[Intro:]
"Comaley, get up! Let's go!"
"Why?"
"Well, it's your lucky day today, pal. You're free!"
"Yup, that's right, you've been pardoned
So come on, get your shit. Let's go!"
"What're you talking about, I don't understand..."
"Yup, governor's pardoned ya
Come on, let's get the fuck outta here!"
"I'm free? Are you serious?!"
"Fuck no! Ya got four more years, stupid ass!
Heh heh heh heh!
Every fuckin day you fall for it!
Heh heh heh!
You fuckin stupid ass!"

[Violent J:]
Dang! Two weeks left...
Insane Clown Posse
Yeah...
When we get out
Wicked clown!

[Verse 1:]
[Violent J:]
When I get out, I'm goin home to Southwest
Going straight to my freaks and getting undressed
And I'mma hit it like an insane chicken hawk
Hoochie won't be able to walk, uh!

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
When I get out, I'll run around town naked
Cause my freedom feels good, I can't fake it!
I'll let my nuts flop to the hip-hop
I wanna chop chop, punk cop, flip flop

[Violent J:]
When I get out, I'm goin to my mother's house
She gonna cook a steak and serve it with brussels sprouts
But I don't care, she can cook a cinder block
And I'mma chew it on up to the last rock!

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
When I get out, I'm putting on my new shoes
But I don't see anybody sporting Kangaroos
And them "Where's the Beef" Shirts are history
But so what, I'mma sport mine like a G!

[Hook:]
[Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Wicked Clown! Yeah, check it out y'all!
Wicked Clown! We getting out y'all!
Wicked Clown! Check it out y'all!
Wicked Clown! We getting out!

[Verse 2:]
[Violent J:]
When I get out, I'm goin to the festival
Cussing rude and scratching my testicles
Like we did before we got locked down
I'm comin back around, the wicked clown!

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
When I get out, I'mma throw a party
And guess who shows up? Nobody!
I just sit alone and play Solitaire
I don't care, at least I won't be here!

[Violent J:]
When I get out, I'm comin back to Delray
So I can breathe the smog, but that's okay
Cause I'd much rather whiff that shit
Than my cellmate Rico's funky armpits!

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
When I get out, I'm headed straight to the sto'
For a big long cold thing of Faygo
And I'mma drink it down to the very end
After that, I'll eat the bottle that it came in!

[Hook:]
[Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Wicked Clown! Check it out y'all!
Wicked Clown! We getting out y'all!
Wicked Clown! Check it out y'all!
Wicked Clown! We getting out!

[Interlude:]
[Violent J:]
"Yeah, lemme call this broad up
And tell her I'm getting out
This my baby, ya know what I'm saying?" ("Hello")
"Wussup, baby. Man, it's me." ("Hello")
"Wait a minute..." ("J?")
"Who the hell is this?!"
("Hold on a man, I'll go get Rachel")
"Who the hell is this?!"

[Verse 3:]
[Violent J:]
When I get out, I'm shootin someone in the head!
Somebody been sleeping in my bed
I never thought my sweetheart would sell me out
Now I gotta walk up and blow her mouth out!

Wicked clown, wicked, wicked clown
[4x]
(Come again?)

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
When I get out, I'm back to the good life
So don't sweat me, Officer Barney Fife!
In the pen I seen your cop friend Budzyn
Seemed Daddy liked to use his butt some!

[Violent J:]
When I get out, it's all about the underground
I'll crawl back into the pipes and never be found
So when you're brush your teeth, ya better think
Ya might see my eyeball lookin at ya through the sink!

[Hook:]
[Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Wicked Clown! Check it out y'all!
Wicked Clown! We getting out y'all!
Wicked Clown! Check it out y'all!
Wicked Clown! We getting out!

[Bridge:]
I'm getting out, I'm getting out!
(Check it out y'all, we getting out y'all!)
I'm getting out, I'm getting out!
(Check it out y'all, we getting out!)
[2x]

[Outro:]
[Violent J:]
Check it out y'all!
