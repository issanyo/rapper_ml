[Verse 1 - Anybody Killa]
How ya doin', it's me again, underneath the concrete
Sewage of the underworld, where the fuckin' dead sleep
Creepin' and crawlin', with the stench of a rat
You can hear me when I'm comin' but ya don't know where I'm at
Never seen in the daylight, only in the nighttime
Huntin' for me somethin' that'll increase my lifeline
I've seen it all, dead bodies and such
Ghetto gators goin' crazy when they haven't had they lunch
The more I kill, the bigger they get
It's like two Hannibal cannibals and one biscuit
Who's to blame that my parents hated me
And put me in the sewer cause they knew I couldn't reach
Seems like I was there for years
Before I grew a little bigger and I gave 'em both a scare
Now I'm addicted to payin' people back
Sittin' underneath the sewer caps and waitin' for you to pass

[Hook]
Down here
There ain't no light
Might not be alright
Down here
In these sewers and pipes
It's always night
Down here
There's no sunlight I'm feelin'
Down here
Ya have to crawl and find it all appealin'
Appealin'

[Verse 2 - Violent J]
Sometimes the tunnels get so small
I have to army crawl
My way through
Can you relate to that?
I can see up ladies skirts
On their way to work
Just for a second
I see they booty and neden
Tell 'em Killa

[Verse 3 - Anybody Killa]
Come and visit us, I know it's somewhere that you wanna be
Gettin' dirty, life of no luxury
Even though this road is so swervy
This place is still home to me

[Hook]
Down here
There ain't no light
Might not be alright
Down here
In these sewers and pipes
It's always night
Down here
There's no sunlight I'm feelin'
Down here
Ya have to crawl and find it all appealin'
Appealin'

[Verse 4 - Violent J]
It's always nighttime in the pipelines
I sit in the sewage waist deep and write rhymes
I know these sewers and which ones are the newest
And which ones be some underground transit movers
We like, Swamp Thing down here damn near
They throw homeless people in, stab 'em cook 'em right there
I can dive, roll, somersault, tunnel crawl, spring
I been bitten by so many fuckin' rats it ain't a thing
I love this, I crawl through your house pipes
I'm hiding in your shower nozzle pissin' on your wife
People down here are hungry, they eat muthafuckers
Everybody's alone, they always eatin' each other
I came crawlin' out the toilet, into somebody's john
I walked out and the family started screamin', it was on
I ran for the fridge and grabbed everything I could
And then dove in through the kitchen sink and back to the hood
I met a hooker down here, ya think they bad up there?
This bitch ain't even have a neden left anywhere
Just a big hole with nothin' in the middle
Her ugly ass titties had a rat hangin' and chewin' off of each nipple
Runnin' through the dark maze, I know my ways
I know no days, only glowing rays
Beaming through the sewer hole lids of the streets
Certain parts, but them parts certainly ain't for me

[Hook]
Down here
There ain't no light
Might not be alright
Down here
In these sewers and pipes
It's always night
Down here
There's no sunlight I'm feelin'
Down here
Ya have to crawl and find it all appealin'
Appealin'

[Repeat] -x4
There's no sunlight
There's no sunlight
Down here
