My wish is...
My.. my wish is...
My wish is....

My wish is, I hope to do for you
All that you've done, because all that you do it's like magic
Your amazing me, a diamond for free
Your as real as can be and to keep you, I'd give up everything I own
The mic and my life just don't leave me alone you're my partner
I want you to see, no matter how bad things in life can be

You've always got me
You've always got me

Now you trust me, I carry that so tight
I'll be there for you, if your wrong or your right
It doesn't matter, just reach out to me
I will never question, any opportunity to show you
And prove to you that I care, always you share and you've always been there
Your my best friend, it's easy to see
No matter how bad things in life can be..

You've always got me
You've always got me

My wish is, I hope to do for you
All that you've done, because all that you do it's like magic
Your amazing me, a diamond for free, your as real as can be
And you have always got me

You've always got me
You've always got me
You've always got me
