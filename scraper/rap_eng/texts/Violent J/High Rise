The floor 'round his body slowly started to crack
He was screamin' but no one could do nothin' but step back
He plunged below until the level beneath
Broke five ribs both hands and blew out his teeth
But the level below is where they all want his position
They all look the other way and continue with bull shittin'
The floor's crackin' again he screams help someone
And then smashed down right through it like something engulfed him

There once was a man of power who lived on top of his high rise (his high rise)
Bloody red were his eyes, they say wealthiest in town (in town)
First his chair crushed beneath him, even with the help of his top guys (top guys)
They couldn't lift him up that day somethin' was pullin' him down (down)

The floor 'round his body slowly started to crack
He was screamin' but no one could do nothin' but step back
He plunged below until the level beneath
Broke five ribs both hands and blew out his teeth
But the level below is where they all want his position
They all look the other way and continue with bull shittin'
The floor's crackin' again he screams help someone
And then smashed down right through it like something engulfed him

His beat up and broken body blasting its way down the high rise (high rise)
Leaving a hole on every level, which others gather around (around)
He's screaming as he's falling don't let them take me from my life (my life)
Dropping tier by tier something was pulling him down

Ahhh

Crashing down through every level all the people turn and look away
Somebody help me, help me
Somebody help me, help me
Crashing down through every level all the people turn and look away
Somebody help me, help me
Somebody help me, help me

He was old and weak and frail (frail frail), he casted hell from his high rise (his high rise)
Some say his building was so tall so on the world he looked down (down)
I bet now he wishes it wasn't built from the ground up a mile (o o o)
Every level brings him closer down to whatever's in the ground (whatever's in the ground)

The floor 'round his body slowly started to crack
He was screamin' but no one could do nothin' but step back
He plunged below until the level beneath
Broke five ribs both hands and blew out his teeth
But the level below is where they all want his position
They all look the other way and continue with bull shittin'
The floor's crackin' again he screams help someone
And then smashed down right through it like something engulfed him
Nobody really seemed to care much on any level
Watchin' him fall and guessin' that he'll meet the devil
His head hit a rock maybe a pipe I don't know and know
But he was dead and now he's still got eight floors to go
He landed in a kitchen on a tray of steak blades
Even though he was dead his hair went flippin' off the maze
What was left of his body smashed through all the floors
A mangled ball of meat rolled out the front doors
