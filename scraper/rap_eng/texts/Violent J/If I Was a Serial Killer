[Violent J]
If I was a serial killer
They would find all my victims heads
In funky-ass gas station toilets
And if I was a serial killer
I would be strange and deranged
And I would never change
If I was a serial killer
I'd be known as "The Smoker"
Cuz I would cut off and smoke all of they hair
And if I was a serial killer
I would sleep on broken glass and thumb tacks
And I would smoke mad crack

[Shaggy]
First thing I would do would be to kill a couple hotties
That always get 'em mustered up; decapitated bodies
Dumped on state police lawn just before dawn
To let 'em know my ritual had begun
I'd crack a 40 with the devil, tell him dig me a hole
Cuz I'm comin when I die, until that I'm in control
This is if I was a serial killer, and though I ain't
But if I was I'd do my walls up blood red with blood paint
This is if I was a serial killer, and though I ain't
But if I was I'd never stop because I'd know that I can't

[Violent J]
If I was a serial killer
I would drive a back van
And I would ride around the college campus
And if I was a serial killer
I would walk among us and gain trust
Until I needed that rush

[Shaggy]
I park outside these bitches homes then drive away
Then come back with my light off, this time I'm here to stay
I'd wear human bones around my neck and have my ceremonies
Then go back upstairs and microwave some macaronis
You know what's all up in my trunk, so don't ask me to pop it
Once I get out to my cabin then I'll finally unlock it
This is if I was a serial killer, and though I'm not
If was I'd snap a photo once they die on the spot
This is if I was serial killer, and though I'm not
But if I was I'd know that I can't, so I would never stop

[Violent J]
And I don't know myself anymore
And I don't know who I am anymore
And I don't know who to be anymore
And I don't know who I am anymore
And I don't know what to think anymore
And I don't know who I am anymore
Except that I am strange and deranged
And I don't know who I am anymore
And I will never change

If I was a serial killer, I would bury all my special projects
Underneath the garden in my grandmother's back yard
And if I was a serial killer, I would be strange and deranged
And I would rock my hatchet chain
