There was a pounding at my door it was 3:30 in the mornin
Thunderin and lightnin outside and fuckin pourin
I looked out through the peephole but they blocked it with their thumb
I got pissed and opened up the door and I was fuckin stunned
It was Frankenstein straight up with the bolts in his neck
And them bigass fuckin boots standing there soakin wet
He said I told him shit you can say that again
Come on in but don't be tryin to fuckin kill me man

My homie Frankenstein
What's up with you?
I'm only down with Frankenstein
That's how I do

He blew up my fuckin toilet somethin wretchedly wicked
Even though the only thing he says is we kick it
One time he tried to kill me but that's just his way
Every time I bring some bitches home he scares em away
He's fuckin clumsy as fuck big and dumpy and green
Sewn together body parts from different dead human beings
The fuckin top of his head is flat can't nobody fuck with that
If he breaks your back in half then you fuckin stuck with that

My homie Frankenstein
What's up with you?
I'm only down with Frankenstein
That's how I do

I thought he was just a horribly legendary figure
Until he showed up and blew my couch out bigger
He tried to kill my neighbor's wife the police they came and got em
He gave two cops a rock bottom the rest shot em
That only got him pissed and he smashed through a wall
Out into the yard the hardest shit I ever saw
He was out of sight gone in the night no further news
But I know he'll be back cause he forgot his neck screws

My homie Frankenstein
What's up with you?
I'm only down with Frankenstein
That's how I do
