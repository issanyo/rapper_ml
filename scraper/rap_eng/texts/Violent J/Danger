Mr. Diamond)
If I'm your role model
Then do like me kid
And blow the f**kin block up like I did
I'm f**kin Dangerous!
This ain't to pussy rap
Which rookie should we clap?
Burning everything on the map
We f**king Dangerous!
Got nothing good to say
I hope you all die
Fire rocks, and coming from the sky f**king
Dangerous!
Knives in the mosh pit
Soopa Doopa heat when I bust
Soopa Deranged, Demented and Dangerous!

(Chorus)
Danger Danger, be scared of these strangers
Got the world afraid cause we. Dangerous!
Soop Villainz buck the lead when they spray
And they'll blow you away. Ain't no savin the day
Dangerous!

(Mr. Spade)
Mr. Spade Black Militant
I'm straight killin it
F**k you if you ain't feelin it
Because we Dangerous!
I keep my Uzi coked up in my Jaccuzi
While f**kin with this floozie, I'm Woozy
You know I'm Dangerous!
I keep 10 clips 5 guns and 6 whips
In the trunk I got 6 bricks, of some boy
Dangerous!
I caught a body
I'm crashin my Masarati, through the glass of the hotel
Lobby
How I was probably Dangerous!

(Chorus)
Danger Danger, be scared of these strangers
Got the world afraid cause we. Dangerous!
Soop Villainz buck the lead when they spray
And they'll blow you away. Ain't no savin the day

(Mr. Heart)
Villainz, the illest, they comin to get us, to kill us
But no way
But buck them bitches, f**k them snitches, cause we so

You bump this shit, but you might get hit
Caution we cause wig splits
Got club on the mix, Soopa Villainz we all

Got you scared to listen

F**k your wife up in your kitchen
Because we so Dangerous!
We do this thought you knew this
Yall ain't ready for the criminals
Mothaf**k you hoes, I'll shoot up all the award shows

(Chorus x2)
Danger Danger, be scared of these strangers
Got the world afraid cause we. Dangerous!
Soop Villainz buck the lead when they spray
And they'll blow you away. Ain't no savin the day
Dangerous!
