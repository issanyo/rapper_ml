(look at you.)
(it's on, it's on.)
(girl, damn. hold up. damn.)
Lady, i see you sippin' on somethin'
Sex on the beach, i think
Lady, you wouldn't know it, but i'm watchin'
You let him sip off your drink
He's standin' next to you, pushin' on you and touchin' your body
(i don't like it.)
I have to take him on, stick him quickly, don't get myself bloody

I'm over-powered by jealousy, but that's alright. i'm over-powered by jealousy, as long as you're mine tonight

Lady, even though we never met, yet
I want your body on my floor
Lady, you wouldn't know it but i'm on your shit
You let that mama's-boy score
He's holdin' hands with you, and palmin' your thickness
(i don't like it.)
I have to cut him off, kill the opposition, silence my sick-ness

I'm over-powered by jealousy, but that's alright. i'm over-powered by jealousy, as long as you're mine tonight

(it's on, it's on.)
I don't like it
Even thought we haven't met, yet
(it's on, it's on.)

I'm over-powered by jealousy, but that's alright. i'm over-powered by jealousy (my sickness.), as long as you're mine tonight
(you're mine tonight.)
(but that's alright.)

"get out of here, motherfucker!"
"fuck you, man!"
