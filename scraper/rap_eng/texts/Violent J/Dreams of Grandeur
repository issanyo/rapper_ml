[Violent J]
I was out drinking all night long
Riding home when something went gong
There she was, a prostitute
She look like a druggy but God, she cute
Standing out front a seedy motel
I'm blew out drunk like "What the hell?"
And she was young, like twenty-one
I asked her pimp if she could have some fun
How much to keep her with me 'til dawn?
400 duckets, and it was on
He posted up outside the room
Guarding his treasure, a certified goon
There we were inside her spot
Five minutes later she was smoking a rock
And I was shocked, I just stared
But something burning inside me cared
We talked all night, I passed on fucking
But that glass dick she kept sucking
She was gone, but she was sweet
She was clean but had funky feet
She said her pimp only feeds her rocks
And pays her shit, she can't clean her socks
Together they travel from town to town
He gets paid while she gets down
Behind her life of agonizing
She had a beauty that was hypnotizing
I thought, "What if I made her mine?
Send her to rehab on my dime?"
Cleaned her up, washed her hair
All she needs is someone to care
I could help her escape these streets so mean
And take her home where the sheets are clean
Help her escape that evil devil
And upgrade her to life on my level
Asked was she down, she couldn't believe it
And started to cry, "How do we achieve it?"
I told her, "Just escape your room
And be out front exactly at noon
And I'll swoop on by, and scoop you up
Look for me in my big black truck"
She was with it, we had a plan
I said goodbye and I kissed her hand
I was determined when I got home to be there at noon
And we'd be gone

I laid my head down with dreams of grandeur
(Was she there?) I'll never know the answer
I overslept and woke up at 3
Sobered up like, "What's wrong with me?"
I don't want no crackhead fucking sleeze
As my girlfriend, shit, please
I laughed it off and went back to bed
She can have that pimp instead

[Hook: Young Wicked]
What the fuck was I thinking?
I don't want no hooker
I was up all night drinking
I thought she was a looker
My delusions of grandeur
Made me think I could have her
Made me think I could save her
Damn I was way to faded
Woah, oh, oh
Ah, damn
I was way too faded off
Woah
