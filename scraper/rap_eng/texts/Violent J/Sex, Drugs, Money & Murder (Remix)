[Intro]
I don't give a fuck who you are
It don't fuckin' matter to me, it don't matter to me
If that's how the fuck you gonna be
That's how you gonna be I guess
Ain't shit I can do about that, you can take all that shit
Shove it up that ass of yours cause this shit don't matter no more

[Verse 1: Monoxide Child]
I'm addicted to murder in weird sence
I was just a little shit but the older that I would get
I would notice that the only people I was killing was chicks
When every bitch that I was with
Would end up dead and indecent
Their innocence is the reason for their demise, so many lies
From more others and now I'm taking their lives
Until I'm caught I keep on going while I'm alive
And I'll strive to be the greatest serial killer of all time
Maybe I'll hide inside the back seat of your car
And when you're far enough away
I'll put a crowbar through your heart
Just a start in front of my random thinking from meditating
So every thing's exactly how I mean it
Mistake three when killing for safety
The villain, you've been warned
There's a killer in your building who may be
Knocking at your door so speak
If you're a bitch you better call the police

[Hook x2]
Sex, drugs, money and murder
Should be the last one that you ever heard of
Should be the last one making me nervous
I love sex, drugs, money and murder

[Verse 2: Violent J]
There's a dirty ass needle sticking out of my neck
As I stumble into 7-11 a bloody wreck
People screaming
But in my head I'm only dreaming
No longer plotting and scheming
I come to feed the demon
I jump over the counter knocking shit down around me
Hit the floor punching his skull
And get the pound key and try it open
I grab the whole drawer ran out the door
And stole a Ford Explorer
About to score some more
Wish I was dead but I rather be alive high
I get so jealous when I see a hearse drive by
I should be rotting in it
Piss I'm lying in it
I'm only out for a minute
So I rather try and get it
To exist is both painful and shameful
I lust for chemicals to inject my brain full
Eternal fires they're burning every one of my veins
And only that ice will cool the flames

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Boondox]
I don't know if it's the smell of the gun smoke
The sound of a throat choke or fuckin with dead folk
They get me all excited like a virgin popping cherries
Don't think about the reason cause it's very fucking scary
That I'm feeling no remorse for your corpse no tear drops
Hang around the scene because Dox don't fear cops
Fuck a pig I did the crime now this is my time
And when they move the body then I snortin' up the chalk line
Death, kill, blood spill, burned into my black heart
Tearing you apart, homicide is an art
Like a painting on a wall and you've had your last supper
Let me introduce the matches to the sickest motherfucker
To ever grab a shank and leave it sticking in your gallbladder
Claw and the hammer make the fucking skull shatter
See your brains see your pain then I'm pissing in the wound
And the love of the murder got me barking at a blue moon

[Hook x2]
