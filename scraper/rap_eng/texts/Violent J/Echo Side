(Chanting)

(1st Verse- Violent J, (Shaggy2Dope), [Monoxide Child], {Jamie Maddrox})
Imagine a place that exists beyond, a place that's seldom seen
[A place that even the wickedest souls that burned have never been]
{There was a soul named Damien, he was nothing heaven would save}
[Instead he was cast to the flames of Hell to serve an eternal grave]
(Even in the Afterlife, things don't always go as planned)
[As Satan's realm seeds lunacy, it's hectic and over jammed]
{Damien earned his spot in hell right until his dying day}
So the wagons took his sorry soul and taunted him all the way
[They finally reached that resting place, an endless pit of fire]
(But Damien had escaped through the back door of Satan's lair)
[Out the back entrance of hell but with nowhere else to hide]
His hell is just a tomb, resting in the Echo Side

(Chanting x2)
Underneath the shadows on the other side of time
If there is a hell then there must be a behind
Take me to the ghetto land don't bury me in black
Take me from the Echo Side and never bring me back

(2nd Verse- Violent J, (Shaggy2Dope), [Monoxide Child], {Jamie Maddrox})
Damien ran as far as he could before his legs began decaying
[There were many dead trees, a blood red sky, and headless children playing]
(A wicked man with a long black toungue saw Damien's legs were dead)
So he laid on top of Damien, and then licked the back of his neck and said...

[Fuck the Devil, fuck that shit, we believe in life legit]
Save me from the darkest corner
[If you're hearing what we say, why you throw your soul away?]
Save me from the darkest corner
[Fuck the Devil, fuck that shit, we believe in life legit]
Save me from the darkest corner
[If you're hearing what we say, why you throw your soul away?]
Save me from the darkest corner

(Chanting x2)
Underneath the shadows on the other side of time
If there is a hell then there must be a behind
Take me to the ghetto land don't bury me in black
Take me from the Echo Side and never bring me back

[Fuck the Devil, fuck that shit, we believe in life legit]
Save me from the darkest corner
[If you're hearing what we say, why you throw your soul away?]
Save me from the darkest corner
[Fuck the Devil, fuck that shit, we believe in life legit]
Save me from the darkest corner
[If you're hearing what we say, why you throw your soul away?]
Save me from the darkest corner

(3rd Verse- Violent J, (Shaggy2Dope), [Monoxide Child], {Jamie Maddrox})
{Damien called for many hours, in puddles of blood he lay}
Tortured by everything he saw, yet wishing along the way
[His arms decayed and fell off his body as he rolled along the floor]
{Still trying not to look back, as if something else were in store}
(The clouds above were dark and hot yet dripping with blood rain)
[The ground infested with rodents, that crawled throughout his veins]
{As Damien laid in Echo Side, Hell's screams could still be heard}
The blood red sky would flicker with the tourturing that occured
(Thinking that, he had escaped; every scream he heard he laughed)
The headless children pointed and urinated in his wrath
[He finally saw some fortress gates, so he quickly rolled into it]
These red gates were the front doors of hell...he never knew it. heh heh

Underneath the shadows of the other side of time
If there is a hell then there must be a behind
You can take me to the ghetto land move everything and back
Take me from the Echo Side and never bring me back (repeat till end)
