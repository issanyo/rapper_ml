(Violent J talking)
"Yea...everyday...everyday..psychopathic everyday...eh yo Twin Gats where you at boy?" "I'm Psychopathic Rydin'" "yea, alright now let's let a...Cell Block...c'mon"

(Blaze)
We ridin' on suckas like everyday
We blowin' bitches back out in every way
We dumpin' on fools who be actin' hard
Ya whole damn family'll get blown gone
'Cuz you ain't worth shit ya know, to me
To me and the Rydas, so bring your family tree
'Cuz everyday is somethin' new
Now hollar at Bullet yo, whoo whoo!
(Violent J)
Everyday except on Tuesday
'Cuz that be the Rydas official, kill all fools day
And hey it's like nobody cares, that's when I put ghetto vet's in wheelchairs
And then push'em down a staircase
Brrrrrrrr! just fo' the look on they face
A mental case a little sick in the brain
All the same, it's an everyday thang

(Blaze)(Chorus)
Black trucks bumpin' is "everyday"
Tryin' to bank skrilla is "everyday"
Runnin' wit' a hatchet is "everyday"
"Psychopathic everyday" x2

(Myzery)
I'm not the one to be fucked wit
Fuck a bitchass trick
Eat a dick and die
I know these other tricks that ride
Help me when i'm horny
Even hold my gun fo' me, she ado' me
"Diss everyday bitch after bitch, city after city
And I still treat'em shitty
Tell it to ya face yo, no lie
Everyday I live my life like the world 'bout to die
(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Some ol' everyday shit, some shit that happen everyday
Around Full Clip way, around the Ryda way, hey
Escalades, Navi's, and Benzos
Sippin' Hendal's, pistol whippin' hound dogs
Turn the corner, scoop up the Rydas
Cell Block and Foe Foe tred behind up
We doin' everyday shit, the same shit again
Gettin' paid,oh, and gettin' skins
Chorusx2

(Violent J)
Everyday I slap a bitch in her lips
Kick her in the ass, twist her nipples
Then I grab her by the hips and fuck her in the butt
Uhg uhg...what?
I gives a fuck, i'd fuck her wit' a used rubber after my homeboy's done wit' it
Forget it
I addmit it, I wouldn't do that
'Cuz my dick wouldn't fit in a rubber, it's to fat
(Myzery)
Everyday smokin' green leaf, everyday gat chokin
Everyday no jokin, fuck prayin' an hopin
A born loser,the drug abuser
Mad as fuck in the Land Cruiser
Fuck the dues to be paid, there's crew to be spray'd
If I don't pack my heat, it's a knife to your face
This everyday, all day, I ain't for small pay
I'm high as fuck, thugged out always(give it to me)
Chorusx4
