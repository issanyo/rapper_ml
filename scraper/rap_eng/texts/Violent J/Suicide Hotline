[Violent J + (Suicide Hotline Operator)]
(Suicide Hotline, may I help you?)
Yeah...uh...well I'm 'bout to fuckin' kill myself
(Listen, you don't wanna do that, okay? You don't wanna do that)
I'm gonna..eh...there's so many fuckin' reasons why
I don't even need to be here anymore (There's no reason..)
I'm gonna put a slug in my fuckin' head!
(You don't wanna do that, you wanna be here on Earth okay?)
Fuck that shit man! I got a gun right now..(Put it away)
And I got it right under my chin man, fuck that!
(Take it away from your chin)
I'm gonna fuckin' blow my head all over the ceiling
(No you're not..okay?)
Fuck this shit man..
(Hey, just talk to me, okay?)

[Verse - Violent J + (Suicide Hotline Operator)]
It ain't no point to me wakin' up
Everybody's time I'm takin' up (Noo)
I got nobody, it ain't a shoulder near
I can't stay here and it's colder there (Where?)
I don't wanna look back cause it's gonna hurt
I slice my wrists and it's gonna squirt (Ooh)
For me, everybody holds a hate
I get backstabbed and everybody holds the stake
It's no roads to take, I'm in a circle drive (Ooh)
Bustin' at myself and I'm tryin' to survive
I'll disappoint you, and I will let you down
And I ain't got many home boys comin' around (No?)
You don't understand, so don't say you do (Oh yes I do)
I swear I'll put a motherfuckin' slug in you (Now now)
I'm the only one, the lonely one
At home alone, loadin' a gun thinkin' why not?

[Suicide Hotline Operator]
Why not? Why you wanna die?
Okay, you have feelings inside your head, okay?
I understand that, feelings lead to depression
When you have depression, you have a lonely void inside of your heart
Okay? And your heart means everything to the world, okay?

[Verse - Violent J + (Suicide Hotline Operator)]
I got court comin' up, I stole'd a truck
I got a bitch pregnant and I'm broke as fuck
I wanna get high but I got piss test (Well..)
I'm always first name on top of the shit list (Noo)
Get this, the Witch has made my chest
It's permanent nightly visiting nest (What?)
It ain't no clothes that I look good in
I'm the motherfuckin' big red train that couldn't
I got no family, I stole they shit (Okay)
Restraining orders and I still won't quit
I hit rock bottom, and then I fell in a hole
And then I fell through the floor of that hole some more
I been missing for a year, nobody's lookin' (I am)
I got beat down and my shit tooken (Ooh)
I look ahead and all I see is more of the same
Or this self-inflicted bullet hole pourin' my brain

[Suicide Hotline Operator]
Oooookay, I understand that you're in pain, okay?
I understand everything you're going through
I've been there myself, okay?
Now, your pain is my pain, alright?
And I feel your pain, and I wanna be your friend
Just me and you, friends

[Verse - Violent J + (Suicide Hotline Operator)]
I dream about cuttin' heads off with a shovel (What?)
The dreams are gettin' serious, think I'm in trouble (Oh my..)
I don't hold memory for more than an hour
I'm tired as fuck and I'm drained of power
I ain't half way there and I'm all outta time
I'm like a crushed light bulb, all outta shine (Oh no..)
I been around the world but no place is home
I wanna see the other side when I face this chrome
I'm butt naked, I been jackin' off gettin' drunk
It's my last hours alive, who gives a fuck? (Me)
It don't matter, I'm doin' this shit in the garage
Tryin' to make it easier for them to clean my head splaage
This bitch I loved, I hope she finds me
Still up in the chair with my thoughts behind me (Wait, wait..)
I'm 'bout to do it (*beep*)
Can you hold for a second? (Wait a min..)

[Violent J + Girl]
Hello?
(Hey, what's up?)
Where you at?
(Right down the street)
With who?
(My girl Shannon, we were wonderin' if we could stop by)
Well shit, yeah, come on by
(Really?)
Yeah..hey hey hey hey
(I know, bring some blunts alright)
(*chuckle*) Alright, bye
