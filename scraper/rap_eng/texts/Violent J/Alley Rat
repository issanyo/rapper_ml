[Verse 1: Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope]
Gang bang, pissed off, swang thang, shit talk
Southwest, street hood, spit on, ripped off
No hoes, pro wings, no real, gold rings
Lips swoll, chin rocked, eye's in them o rings
Street clown, no jokes, voodoo, no hoax
Never die, can't croak, strokes for them old folks
Smoke dope, pop pills, lift axe, chops kill
Drink blood, drip spills, grab the mic and drop skills
Chased off, broke down, people up folk down
Full moon, choke sound, on the Murder-Go-Round
No love, no slack, pie-face, slap back
Heifer, let me tap that, like you a chipmunk and..

[Hook]
I'm an alley rat, an alley rat
I only want to be where the scrubs be at
I gotta get it, I wanna get it, the lot I gotta get it
I gotta get it, I wanna get it, the lot I gotta get it
I gotta get it..

[Verse 2: Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope]
Last place, don't care, scrub life, I'm there
Red mist, I wear, wet blood, big smear
Just know, dark nights, warm glow, street lights
Breakin in, tied tight, I'm talking all, I like
No look, fuck style, never calm, buck wild
Jumpin off, rooftops, face painted, fake smile
(who? what? what chuck? nevermind, what the fuck?)
Now I'm ridin up stuck, underneath an UPS truck
(what you see? I looked around, tell me, thought I seen a clown)
No peep, not a sound, no one looking, never found
Fuck jobs, fuck rules, fuck church, fuck schools
Fuck court, fuck jail, hospitals and funerals (fuck 'em)
I ain't goin, I'm hoein, you hoes out
When I die, bury me with my dick in your mouth

[Hook] - 2X
I'm an alley rat, an alley rat
I only want to be where the scrubs be at
I gotta get it, I wanna get it, the lot I gotta get it
I gotta get it, I wanna get it, the lot I gotta get it
I gotta get it..
