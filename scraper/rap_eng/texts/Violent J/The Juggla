[Verse 1: Violent J]
Well, you know the Juggla jumped in the mix
I've been down the road and I've broke a few necks
And I'll break a few more, so what's up?
Roll by me on the corner I'ma hold my nuts up
And spit a fuck you wit that (wit that)
But if you're a sewer skank lemme hit that (hit that)
Cause Violent J ain't even one to fake it
I done seen some folded up skank bitches naked
I pass out when it gets dark
And woke up naked at the Clark Park
Gotta go, gotta get before I get the rap
Got a chopped off head chillin' in my lap
Mr. Shrink, Mr. Shrink, I'm sick
Lunatic tick, tock, it don't quit
It don't quit, it don't quit
Mr. Shrink I'm sick, a lunatic-y-tic
The doctor told me I'm a psycho
So I ate his face like I don't know
Knife to the neck and I got some mo'
The night of the axe, the night of the .44
Bitch, I'm a man you can talk ta'
But after you leave I'ma stalk ya
If you're a little kid I'ma take ya
And if you're a neck I'ma break ya
If you're an old lady I'ma mug ya
Cause bitch, you can't fuck with The Juggla

[Interlude:]
Yes ladies and gentleman, he is: The Juggla
He'll cut your windpipe, eat your face
And slit your motherfuckin' heart out
You can see this freak show at the world famous Carnival of Carnage
Keep jugglin', motherfucka'

[Verse 2: Violent J]
Cause you know the Juggla will throw ya up fast
And if I drop you, that's your ass
I shake and twist tryna keep calm
I might go to hell cause I'm down with Esham
Got a rhyme for your uncle Willy
Then I hit him in the head with a billy
Willy, Willy, watch your mouth
And fuck the South
Runnin' with a gang of 20 street hoods, yo
What's up bitch ah, what's up ho?
Sometimes ya act like ya ain't down
With a psychotic wicked clown
Fuckin' my friends ain't healthy
Cause I grab you by the face and fuck you up
And it's like that bitch, that's the way it is
I'm allowed to fuck ho, I'm in Showbiz
Sets in the hood want me for dead
So I paint my tag on they forehead
Stick your little "K" by my taggin'
You can fit 20 clowns in a Volkswagen
And we comin' straight to your brick house
I'ma huff and puff and blow your fuckin' neck loose
And then I might mug ya
Cause there'll be no fuckin' with The Juggla

[Interlude #2:]
Jugglin' eyeballs, jugglin' heads
What you've heard about, what you've read
The jugglin' wicked clown will come to your birthday party
Wedding and bar mitzvah
And cut your back off for a small fee
The Juggla ain't takin' no shorts from nobody

Tweedle dee and tweedle dum
Let the fuckin' bass go

[Verse 3: Violent J]
And The Juggla make it last
Down with 2 Dope and John Kickjazz
My fellow fuckin' fellas
Southwest gangsta killas
Violent J the psychopathic
Some might say I'm schizophrenic
Others think I'm klepto-psychic
But somehow the bitches like it
What's up bitch, let me get the shot
Right here and now, butt naked on the spot
Why am I like this? (like that) Why are you like that? (like this)
The ghetto took my brain and motherfuck I want it back
I'm that nerd in the back of the class
That went psycho and killed ya ass
I slash and cut and hack
With a 'kick me' sign on my back
In my court-assigned therapy
They take care of me, but don't stare at me
Cause like I said I'll mug ya
Now run on home and don't fuck with The Juggla

[Interlude #3:]
Finally happened, the wicked clown has come to your town
And he's got your daughter by the hand, showin' her a new land
The Southwest Ghetto Zone where all the Jugglas roam
Come one, come all and have The Juggla cut your face off
Skip to the Lou

Juggla, Juggla, fuck with The Juggla (3x)
Ya can't fuck with The Juggla

Juggla, Juggla, fuck with The Juggla (3x)
Ya can't fuck with The Juggla

"Tweedle dee and tweedle dum
Let the fuckin' bass go"
