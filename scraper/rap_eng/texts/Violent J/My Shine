This is for all the Juggalos enjoyin these days with us in Shangri-Lees ass

Poof of smoke and we're there hella tight
Like Hallowicked 2002 second night
Let me tell these fucks about 8 Mile road
And how we run this bitch, let the truth be told
Black truck convoys stretching East to West
With little hatchetmen in back windows upper left
This juggalo nation, can't nothin' compete
Cause we run under with the dirt flip side of the street

Ever since the first time I seen the diamond rain
I'm lovin' every second that it shine the same
So many wanna see us bring the fire rain
Why can't we just enjoy it, while the time remains?

I in a crystal forest under a green lit sky
Tornadoes of glitter float calmly by
Angels fly naked letting they titties swing
And so many fucking diamonds, you can ice errrrthing

Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
You ain't stoppin' mine, it's so fine

Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
You ain't stoppin' mine, you ain't stoppin' mine

Rap Game, it's happenin', I'm stepping in
I represent the hatchetman, the best I can

You can not hold be back

Just like The Wraith I walk through you
I Kung-Fu like guru and Southwest Voodoo
It's Joe Bruce baby, legendary relax
I see running down hallways now looking for cracks

Every morning when I'm wake up and no halo on my shit
I got a body on my bathroom floor
So I cut it and I chop it and I wrap and I drop it
I take a shower and I'm ready for more

I get wicked like AIDS in a gay mans butt
I spit lyrics so cold my mouths frozen shut

Rap Game, it's happening, I'm stepping in
I represent the hatchetman, as best I can

Ruby red trees, yellow gem bushes
Mercury waterfalls, granting all wishes
Neon clouds, look in the myst you'll find
My axe in the back of the fool trying to stop my shine

Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
You ain't stoppin' mine, it's so fine

Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
You ain't stoppin' mine, you ain't stoppin' mine

Rap Game, it's happenin', I'm steppin' in
I represent the hatchetman, as best I can (Truth is)

I never been to any Churches, cept for some chicken
I dont trust noone, I tell a priest eat a dick, and
Then spit some old school Esham on his ass
I even used Bible papers when I've twisted my grass
But the Carnival has always been around with us blessing
It ain't never tried to feel up my balls at confession
We know the Carnival is God. That's odd? So what. It is
And we ain't sorry if we tricked you Bitch!!!"

Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine (YES! THINK WE GIVE A FUCK? WHAT?)
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
You ain't stoppin' mine, its so fine

Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine (THE FUCK?)
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine (WHAT?)
You ain't stoppin' mine, you ain't stoppin' mine

Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
You ain't stoppin' mine, it's so fine

Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine
You ain't stoppin' mine, you ain't stoppin' mine

Rap Game, it's happenin', I'm steppin' in
I represent the hatchetman, as best I can
