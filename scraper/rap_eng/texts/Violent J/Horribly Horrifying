These woods are looking scary
Everybody stay close to me
And we staying on track
So that I can get back to Detroit
Like I'm supposed to be

[Violent J]
So very scary, so dark, so Erie
For everybody near me, I'm weary
Fuck a cemetery 'cuz they bury the dead
And very much I be alive, we seeing vines and hides
And all these trees that tower us are Outta date and strung out
They spread stripes on your cheeks when we slap your tongue out
This be the bad side of town, that got us looking around
They put it down; we see a mushroom buggy 3 to the ground
And oh my god it's getting darker
Call me Peter Parker, cuz' spiders just biting
I'm hearing noises they frightening, and I just realized something
Holding on to crow's hoodie
I'm getting' paranoid fast
Burning all this mud grass
Something is watching us, creeping around
I hear his feet to the ground
It's gone be beating us down
And half eaten when found, it sound decent tomorrow

[Jamie Madrox]
Why you acting like a little bitch right now?

[Monoxide Child]
And how!

Morbid Horrors, you can't ignore us
Horribly it's horrifying
Horror forest, something's before us
Horribly it's horrifying
Don't' be scared, Don't be scared
Don't be scared, Don't be scared!
Morbid Horrors, May they be yours
Horribly it's horrifying

[Violent J]
What the Fuck, shh, I heard a branch snap, listen
A twig break, a leaf crunch, somebody's pissing

[Jamie Madrox]
Man get the fuck Outta here with that bullshit, bro...

[Jamie Madrox]
Let's just stick to the road, and be quick to the dro

[Violent J]
I took a shit in the woods and whipped my ass
With a purple mushroom
About an hour ago I assume
Maybe that's why I always feel
Like somebody's watching me
And I got no privacy

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Save it for your bedroom mirror, scream in fear
You was right, be scared, bitch, the lion is here

[Violent J]
Once I heard that, I knew that's all it would take
I started screaming like a cheerleader about to get raped
A big ass lion jumped out, like he was ready to fight
At least it's three against one, but I'm the only one in sight
My two homies was gone, lost deep in the night
I pulled the blunt out looked at the lion, said, you gotta light?

Morbid Horrors, you can't ignore us
Horribly it's horrifying
Horror forest, something's before us
Horribly it's horrifying
Don't' be scared, Don't be scared
Don't be scared, Don't be scared!
Morbid Horrors, May they be yours
Horribly it's horrifying

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Hear the roar of the king of the jungle
Yes me, not Tarzan, so go, it's the lion, you stepping on my turf
And one of y'all dying tonight that's for sure, "that's for sure?"
You think it's your lucky day, you think I'm hear to play
You saw the do not enter sign; you had to cross it anyway
Reconsider killing you; don't even make me laugh
You stumbled in my kingdom; the next breath's your last...

[Violent J]
Mister, mister death and destruction
May I ask you a question you got everything
Why you fucking with something with nothing
We ain't even from around here we just passing through
You come crashing through; I'm only asking you...

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Truth is I'm bored
Everybody scared of me
I smelled yall over
Here puffing the lovely
And fuck that blunt, facts
I'm just gonna ask
Do any yall motherfuckers no
Where the hoes at?

[Violent J]
Maybe on the southwest side, I know a few
But straight up I know them hoes ain't trying' to fuck you

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
How 'bout I swipe your head off?

[Violent J]
How about you relax
I'm only saying these hoes don't fuck half lions like that
But I know this one player, this pimp right here in town
He's got mad furry bitches that be swinging they tails round
His name is the Wizard, fact that's were we headed

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Don't mind if I do tag along, fucking get me some neden...

Morbid Horrors, you can't ignore us
