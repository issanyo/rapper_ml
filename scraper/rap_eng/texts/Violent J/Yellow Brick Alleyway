[Intro: In Background]
Damn....Fuck....What the fuck
Umm let me get myself together..Look here

[Verse 1]
I'm alive man but don't know where the fuck I am
Damn..I don't understand fantasy land
I'm looking out my kitchen window but I don't see the Sadan
I blocks some damn it's not the land I got the gothcha' rock for 20 spot
I think we outta Michigan the wind it must of put me farther
Seein' purple trees and yellow clouds is talking to each other
Maybe another dimension even a dimension talking trees
With information, work receiving, I got probation I can't be leaving
I'm thinkin' only what I'm needing, emergency needs
A sack of 17 roaches and a O of regelo' weed
I'm standing on the porch I'm still denying this shit
I notice all these tiny little people hiddin' and shit
Its hundreds of 'em all starring at me, scared to they spots
I'm trippin' out cause everything they got be colorful with pokadots
They prolly don't like my raggedy' crack..house on they land
I understand, but when I walked out and said wassup a party began

(*Munchkins wildin' out*)

[Hook: Munchkins]
We don't know who you are and we don't really care
But ya' carnival clown ass is welcome here
Because you and that damn near abandoned house
Landed right on top of the wicket witch of the south

(*All the Munchkins*)
And we hated that wicket bitch so much, said, we hated that slutty hoe
(And we hated that slut)
And you crushed and killed that wicket bitch, we'll be grateful forever more

[Verse 2]
So my house landed right up on some neighborhood trick
Huh..that's the shit..huh..look there go her feet sick huh
Dumb bitch I started playing it off
I seen her in the window so I was running around moving shit and aiming it so, you know
Anyway, how the fuck I'm getting home
(Don't worry see this yellow alleyway will get you home in a hurry
It leads to the wizard, the player, he's the pimpest of all
He'll get you any fucking thing you need)
In that case I'm dancin' with y'all

(*Munchkins wildin' out*)

[Hook 2: Munchkins-(All the Munchkins)-fades out]
