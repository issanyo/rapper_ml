[Intro: Big Hoodoo]
You know! Motherfuckas act like we couldn't make this shit real or something
We could make this real if you want us to hahahaha reality bitch come on
Walk with us

[Verse 1: Anybody Killa]
If we were in a gang
I'd bang on them bitches
Leaving all the snitches
Sleeping with the fishes
If we were in a gang
I'd let it be known
I'm not alone
We lurking outside your home
If we were in a gang
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd be a renegade
Walk around and regulate
If we were in a gang
I'd join the government
Try to rule the world like I was someone that the devil sent
GANGSTA GANGSTA
Everybody shout it
Labeled as a gang
Might as well be all about it
So who's the enemy
I guess we got beef
Looking like a warrior
But feeling like a chief
Nobody said it tripping
This is psychopathic
When you get your first dough
She'll be coming at it
If I'm a gang member
Than I'm a loyal one
Because I'm here to represent and get the job done
We put in overtime
Protecting what we got
So if they think they gonna shut us down I think not
Take in the underground
Just like you've never seen
If I was in a gang, my team would be a big machine
Straight record shit not giving a fuck
When I'm looking for the loot
Everybody's getting stuck
Better duck, when we come around
Bitch we united
I'm gonna keep it real
If we a gang, we bout to riot

[Verse 2: Lyte]
If we were a gang
I'd do the same shit I do now
My psychopathic mind
Star soldiers ready to move out
Now who's down to move pounds
Real live shoot outs
My killers run up in your crib
I'll make that bitch my new house
Now do bounce
(?)
Psychopathic the label that runs beneath the streets
(?)
You can not maintain

[Verse 5: Blahzay Roze]
If we were a gang I'd bash yo head in nicely
Your likely to get a bit of bloodstain on your fresh white tee
I might be the rudest juggalette since the 90's
Like a wicked clown painted up so frightening
Pretty yellow teeth when I (?)
Piggy's wiggin' now watch it rumble we persistent
Can't fuck a juggalette she see you strolling from a distance
Wicked with the blade but we look so innocent
Are you lost?
Try to rape a juggalette cause you thinking that were soft
Put your fucking dick up in my mouth I'll bite your jaw off
Beautifully insane we ain't some hoes you wanna cross
Boss
(?)
And watch the life leave from your eyes
Send your head off to your Momma in a box as a surpise
Then I hide inside her bushes taking pictures while she cries

Stabs to the throat I slice that shit so swiftly


But the blade is rusty so you isn't dying quickly

Holding quarters looking chippy

We be huntin' all night
Got my axe in my left and my 9. in my right
So who the fuck wanna fight me
If we was a gang shit fuck it! we might be
