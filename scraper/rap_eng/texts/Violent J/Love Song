[Intro:]
{Violent J:}
Hello, baby!
I was thinkin about you
So I wrote this song (Yeah!)
I'd like to dedicate this
To the love that is expressed
From you and I
So please sit back
And enjoy!

[Verse 1:]
{Violent J:}
Ey yo bitch, come over here and lemme kick it to ya
Try to stick my nuts in ya, then I never knew ya
Cause you're ugly and ya know ya can't hide that
So what ya look like a chicken with a hunchback?
Oh, it doesn't matter that you're from down South
If ya talk like it I'mma smack you in ya mouth
Bitch I admit it, I'm quick to hit a woman, hey
But that's okay cause bitch I'm Violent J!
And I'm a Southwest Mack Daddy Juggalo
And you're nothin but a two bit stankin ho
But I love you and I hope ya realize that
I don't care about the hair growin out ya back
Smoke a nice blunt, drink some Mad Dog through the night
And your ugly bitch turns into Karen White
And I stick my wing-wang in the middle
I like a filthy ass ho, the kind to make ya nuts shrivel!

[Hook:]
Bitch I'm knockin at yo do'
Lemme get some neden, ho!
Bitch yo ugly, that's okay
I'm finna hit it anyway!
[2x]

[Verse 2:]
{Violent J:}
I guess you want me to take you on a big date
But what you're sayin don't sound all that straight
All I wanna do is feel ya butt and squeeze ya titties
Cause I can't feed your fat ass on a buck fifty
Let's make love my sweet little dove
I wouldn't get near that neden without a glove
Cause its rats and spiders up in there
Hittin that'll take the curl out ya nut hairs
I smack ya titty and it claps when it hits the other
But I don't want 'em clappin too loud it'll wake her mother
Bitches always front like they don't wanna let ya hit it
But then they always screamin banshees when you're gettin with it
So don't fake the funk I'm nothin but a ghetto punk
All I'm tryna do is stick ya in ya fat rump
So get the fuck out them dirty ass drawers
And come and twist my balls!
Cause I love you!

[Hook:]
Bitch I'm knockin at yo do'
Lemme get some neden, ho!
Bitch yo ugly, that's okay
I'm finna hit it anyway!
[2x]


[Outro:]
You and I both know that
I've been on to you in the past
And I know that I love you
And all I wanna do
Is slide my wang into your neden
I wanna hit that neden so damn hard
That my nuts bang on your anus
That's my only true desire
I feel for you, I think for you, I breathe for you
And all I want is a little neden
Ya know, every day when the wind blows
All I hear is my nuts flappin against ya booty hole
And that's all I ever want
And that's all I ever dreamed of
That is you and your neden, bitch
