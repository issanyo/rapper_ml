[Verse 1]
I put my life on my music and everything around me
Streets that I was raised on, livin' on so ruggedly
So I decided way back in the day
That I'm gonna try and take whateva comes my way
You know, by workin' hard to get mine, payin' dues
Tryna make it through, and outsmart some fools
It's been a long time since I got to sit up straight
So best believe I'mma snatchin' off plates

[Hook]
Once I put my life on this
There's nothing left but my guarantee
(Once I put my...Once I put my..
Once I put my..Once I put my)
Once I put my life on this
There's nothing left but my guarantee
(Once I put my life on this
There's nothing left but my guarantee)

[Verse 2]
I been in this game for so many years
With no fears, cause my head is clear
I can see you always tryin' to hate, on what I'm doin'
But you will never stop, what I'm pursuin'
Man, I got heart so fuck havin' enemies
Take it to the stage, and I'll make you just a memory
I put my life on every word that I say
My guarantee is that I'm here to stay (So watch for me!)

[Hook]
Once I put my life on this
There's nothing left but my guarantee
(Once I put my...Once I put my..
Once I put my..Once I put my)
Once I put my life on this
There's nothing left but my guarantee
(Once I put my life on this
There's nothing left but my guarantee)

[Verse 3]
Mixed tapes, and bootlegs been through it all
In for the long haul, follow me y'all!
Put your hands up if you're down for the struggle
Cause it's time to push through this rubble, uh!
I got one thing on my mind, willing to grind
Both feet on the ladder, and I'm ready to climb
Too many mouths to feed, so you gots to believe
That I put my whole life on what the fuck I achieve
(And that's my life!)

[Hook]
Once I put my life on this
There's nothing left but my guarantee
(Once I put my...Once I put my..
Once I put my..Once I put my)
Once I put my life on this
There's nothing left but my guarantee
(Once I put my life on this
There's nothing left but my guarantee)
