[Verse 1]
My reflection fades more in the mirror everyday
Dark clouds in the sky feel like they pullin me away
Day dreamin but i'm leanin like my bodies in a coma
Could ya wake Me out my sleep cause i'm weak from the aroma
Let me slip into your ear and take a trip with all my listeners
Into a new dimension with the Hoodoo practitioner
This is the story about the evil that never dies
Where worlds collide my soul just arrived from the darkside

[Hook]
Hoodoo can you blow your magic all over me
And take me from this life of confusion? (confusion)
This world is not the place i feel that i oughta be
Where your happiness is just an illusion (illusion)

[Verse 2]
I'm gone off dust in the desert by the fire
Smokin Bob Marley, tryin to talk to Richard Pryor
Speakin in tongues but the souls hear me clearly
When i finish chantin you can see 'em standin near me
Ridin with the dead like i'm drivin in a hearse
You wanna ride with us, we gotta kill you first
Black magic hour gettin better with my power
Look the wraith in the eye so you don't die like a coward
Shadows comin at you from all around out the darkness
Sinister intentions, their henchmen are heartless
You see flashes of the bad shit you did in life
The more you watch the more you fade away from the light
Now it's void of all color you caught in between
Where the wind never stops and all you hear is screams
You can't get away ask anyone that's tried
Your soul is now forever lost in the darkside

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hand full of black magic, I throw some
Of a crumb land on you, watch you go numb
Detroit City where the real killers come from
Fuck with us we'll leave you on the steering wheel slump
With your brains oozin out both of your eye sockets
Run your pockets, stomp your girlfriend and conscious
I'm with the monsters because they know that i'm a beast
Starvin like i never ate, now it's time to feast
If you relatin then for you this is your release
Big Hoodoo or call me The Jinx
Doe Dubbla a hustla from 7 Mile
I'm Psychopathic now we dominate the underground
And i don't fuck around i'm holdin my position down
When i roll through your town we gonna smoke a pound
Drink the potion out the skull, my life is fried
I don't give a fuck cause i'm in love with the darkside

[Hook x2]
