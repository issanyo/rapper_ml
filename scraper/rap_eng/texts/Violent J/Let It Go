[Verse 1]
Sometimes I miss the thrill of being brand new
There's nothing that I can do
To live it again but lookin back all them years I ran through
Explorin through the halls up at moms work kickin it
My first time i hit a neden freakin that I'm stickin it
Lookin for two letters rollin in cheap for days
I miss sneakin into wrestling knowing the million ways
I miss ignoring the curfew and cuttin through people yards
Duck and hide from cars that ninja suit was so hard
But it's still so much more ahead and it's all brand new
As for the rest of it you can't do except let it go

[Hook]
Let it go cause there ain't shit you can do
Keep riding and enjoying the view

[Verse 2]
I miss hanging with Breed in mad clubs downtown
I miss seeing my homie Alex always around
I miss the days of shangri-la my navie bangin' hart
Bada Bing's in Orlando my favorite titty bar
Nelson ledges and wicked walk a tour with Bone Thugs
Nate the mac always haven my back I send him love
Some of us lost touch but we all remain true
There's so many yesterdays still everything is brand new
There's so much coming ahead so much more to the show
As for everything else in the past you got to let it go

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I miss my son and my daughter tacking there very first steps
Sometimes I catch myself missing shit that ain't happen yet
Sometimes I wish it would remain and maintain forever
Still I've learned life will always change as sure as the weather
For worse or for better there's always turns and curves
Shit so clear in the day becomes all distant and blurred
I just enjoy the ride cause every day is brand new
As for the rest of it you can't do except let it go

[Hook x4]

[Bridge]
Let that shit go
There's so much coming ahead
So much more to the show
As for everything else in the past
You got to let it go

[Hook]

[Outro]
Let it go
Let it go
You oughta let it go
Let that shit go
