(Shaggy 2 Dope)
This is a tale of misplaced love
A tale of a man searching for that misplaced love in all the
Wrong places and how he gets his heart ripped out of his chest and
Stuck in his face so he can watch it slowly stop beating let's
Listen on and hear how my gumpy friend violent jay goes about
Getting his feelings crushed once again

(Violent J)
After 3 years in a mental asylum
I'm finally out and I'm fine now no doubt
Rolling home I see a bitch on a payphone
She was fat and round and had it going on
She had a name tag on Roxy Carol
Stepped up to her like hello
We was kicking it
I said I got this dick sup on lickin it
She said I'm down for the tactics
Then my dick stood up like a Tucson cactus
I threw her in the back of my jaloppe
She was wet and sloppy
But nothing could stop me
I was like jesus
Her neden was yellow and smelled like cheese pizza
I paid it no mind
I stuck my dick in raw and comenced to grind

(Violent J and 2 Dope)
Toxic love

Did it hurt you?
Yes
Toxic love
I'm so lonely, lonely lonely lonely
Toxic love
Did she burn you?
Yes
Did it hurt you?
Yes

The whole car smelled like pickles
I stuck my toe in her ass
And tweaked her titty nipples
We fucked for about an hour
I dropped her off where I found her and went for the shower
I got home and I kicked back
Thought about the shower haha fuck that
When I woke up the very next morning
I was awake but my dick was snoring
It was whistling and shooting out smoke
The head was spinning like a dayton hundred spoke
I started shaking and sweating
I had a fever
My dick was swelled up like a faygo 2 liter
It was greenish with purple bungions
And dripping blue skeet and flaking like onions
She gave me skiffilufigus no doubt
I'ma find that bitch and knock her the fuck out

(Violent J)
I'm on a mission I search and roam
Cuz my dick hole is spurting up pink foam
And I'm dragging my balls behind me
They're as big as a mailbox bumpy and slimy
Thank god I ain't dead yet
My dick is crispy but my drawers are wet somehow
There she is on the same payphone
Near Zug Island in the industrial waste zone
Wait a minute y'all hold up
Is that the same bitch I was with she looks toe-up
Holy fuck nothings in place that ain't a girl at all
It's a barrel of toxic waste!
Oh lord what have I done?
Roxy Carol is a toxic waste barrel
Me and my green dick headed back to the looney bin
I'm here to turn myself back in

(Violent J)
I still like you
When I inject my penis inside of you
My balls light up like light bulbs
You're green...You're green and you're so warm
