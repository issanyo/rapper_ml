[Verse 1: Violent J]
I walked into the church dressed up as an alter boy
I seen the preacher he said, "Little boy I'm a teacher"
Put his hand up on my shoulder, felt the claw of the beast
I never thought it'd be so fuckin easy murderin a priest
We went into the confession booth, he took off his clothes
And cut some yay right on his bible top and ooted his nose
I jammed a butchers knife twelve inches into his gut
He looked me right into my eyes while I was yankin' it up
Preacher killas!

[Hook]
Crooked preacher killas (Stop it!)
Crooked preacher killas (I gotta bloody 'em up!)
Crooked preacher killas (Stop it!)
Crooked preacher killas

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I walked into the sermon strapped with an iron crowbar
I beat a nun into a bloody stew in the trunk of my car
How the fuck she got fake titties and a pussy ring? BULLSHIT!
She sucked the preacher's dick in the pulpit
I know the goin's on, I've witnessed it while pushin' my mop
And blood gushin don't stop when my hatchet go chop
I ain't no fuckin holy rolla, I'm outta controlla
Face painted fuckin preacher killas gone off they yola!

[Hook:]
Crooked preacher killas (Cola!)
Crooked preacher killas (I gotta bloody 'em up!)
Crooked preacher killas (Stop it!)
Crooked preacher killas

[Verse 3:]
{Violent J, (Shaggy 2 Dope):}
We shootin for the preacher, FUCK! I missed and hit the reverend
But it doesn't matter though, they say he's goin to heaven
(And then I shot for the preacher, I blew his ear off!
We in the balcony bustin, gone off PCP and Smirnoff)
Shot again, I missed and hit somebody in the choir
They fell back into the candle rack and caught the place on fire
(I shot again, I finally caught the preacher in his dome
Then we put our barells to each other's heads and took it home!)

[Hook:]
Crooked preacher killas (Stop it!)
Crooked preacher killas (I gotta bloody 'em up!)
Crooked preacher killas (Stop it!)
Crooked preacher killas (Leave the fuckin kids alone!)

Crooked preacher killas (Faggots!)
Crooked preacher killas (I gotta bloody 'em up!)
Crooked preacher killas (Stop it!)
Crooked preacher killas (I gotta bloody 'em up!)

[Outro:]
Hell is a real place...
