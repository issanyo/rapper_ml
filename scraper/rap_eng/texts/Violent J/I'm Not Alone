Maggots can't fuck with the Shaggy
'Cause I got a crew, bitch (Hahahahaha)
A crew like you ain't never even known
Carnival freaks from the ghetto zone
All waiting for the day to put you in your place
I'll have the fat bearded lady sitting on your face (Hahahahaha)
Bitch boy bitchy you might get hurt
Dead Carnival clowns putting in w-w-w-work
You think your the shit 'cause you think you got the upper hand
But why don't you come and meet my boy, the Strong Man
And he'll grab you by the head and squeeze until it pops
And shake your motherfucking neck until your head flops
'Cause I'm running with the beyond, you motherfucks
I'll make a voodoo doll of ya, and flick your nuts (Hahahahaha)
See I was born to cause a killer carny ruckus
I came up and then- stop it I told ya motherfuckers
I leave a screw driver sticking half way out your dome
The worst part about is, I'm not alone


Jokers and freaks deep in the night
Thought I was a nerd but you picked the wrong fight
J-J-J-Jimmy cracked corn but they don't care
They bust you in your motherfucking head with a chair
Jokers and freaks deep in the night
Thought I was a nerd but you picked the wrong fight
J-J-J-Jimmy cracked corn but they don't care
They bust you in your motherfucking head with a ch-ch-chair


I'm a nerd, and all the bitches call me a nerdy geek
And they would love to stick their thumbtacks on my seat
And they would throw their split balls at that class freak
And everyone of them bitches died in their sleep
'Cause I fuck around with books and my self was born
Crystal balls, black magic and jokers cards
And that night just when I'm feelin lonely
The clowns come to my bed and juggle for me
So don't fuck with the Shaggs 'cause I cast spells
And don't come crying to me when your tongue swells
I'm hanging with freak shows, like Crab Boy, Snake Boy
Flipper and Scab Boy
And a man who can eat his own fucking face
And then shit it out and screw it back into place
If you don't think so you can suck my bone
'Cause I tried telling ya man, I'm not alone

Jokers and freaks deep in the night
Thought I was a nerd but you picked the wrong fight
J-J-J-Jimmy cracked corn but they don't care
They bust you in your motherfucking head with a chair
Jokers and freaks deep in the night
Thought I was a nerd but you picked the wrong fight
J-J-J-Jimmy cracked corn but they don't care
They bust you in your motherfucking head with a ch-ch-chair
Jokers and freaks, jokers and freaks

Well I like to hang with Tall Jess and Jump Steady
Nate The Mack , Violent J and Uncle Freddy
Chucky, motherfucking yes, 'cause got my respect
But I really like to hang with old Rubber Neck
A freak show from the circus that you don't know
And I fucked the Lion Lady in the knitting hole
And sometime she do an acrobatic flip on my nuts
And it feels so good!
So tell your boys that they all a bunch of chump suckers
I walk around your neighborhood chokin' motherfuckers
I used to be a fool but now the joker's got juice
Shit changed when I started hanging out with Zeus
And if you take me out you know I'm coming back again
With my homeboys Jack and the Cannon Man
He come flying out the barrel doing Mach 9
With his fist coming straight for your spine
Never fuck with the Shaggs 'cause it's always tickin
I'll throw a curse and turn your ass into a chicken
So when you see me by my lonely in the ghetto zone
Motherfucker better realize, I'm not alone

Jokers and freaks deep in the night
Thought I was a nerd but you picked the wrong fight
J-J-J-Jimmy cracked corn but they don't care
They bust you in your motherfucking head with a chair
Jokers and freaks deep in the night
Thought I was a nerd but you picked the wrong fight
J-J-J-Jimmy cracked corn but they don't care
They bust you in your motherfucking head with a ch-ch-chair


Who's that (Jokers and freaks)
Who's there?
No, stop it!
Ahh, I can't stand it
Ahh, go away
Leave me alone
No, no, ahhhhh!

Jokers and freaks deep in the night
Thought I was a nerd but you picked the wrong fight
J-J-J-Jimmy cracked corn but they don't care
They bust you in your motherfucking head with a chair
Jokers and freaks deep in the night
