"Would you show me the door?
My apologies
I will slither out across the floor
I will crawl out on my knees
I'm ugly, my soul is ugly too
I have so many flaws
I'm sorry but there's nothing I can do
I hate myself because I....

I'll stand far away!
My apologies
I wouldn't wanna dull your sunny day
I'll crawl out on my knees

I'm sorry, I wreak of depression
I have so many flaws
Your happiness is my only obsession

Just you, all you
Don't blame me I never can believe how stupid I can sound
For you, only you
It's obviously my fault why can't I? And figure out what's wrong with me
Just you, all you
I can never truly make you satisfied sometimes I just wish I wasn't me
For you, only you
Maybe I'd be better off alone all I do is embarass me

I'm nasty, I'll try not to get me on you
My apologies
God forbid, what would we do?
I'll crawl out on my knees
I'll stand far away
I have so many flaws
I wouldn't wanna dull your sunny day

My karma last night, was your dinner
My apologies
I will follow you cause your a winner
I will crawl out on my knees
You aura, it glows like toxic waste
I have so many flaws
Spit and I would lick it just to taste your presence

Just you, all you
Don't blame me I never can believe how stupid I can sound
For you, only you
It's obviously my fault why can't I ? and figure out what's wrong with me
Just you, all you
I can never truly make you satisfied sometime I just wish I wasn't me
For you, only you
Maybe I'd be better off alone all I do is embarrass me

I'm staring at your picture
Standing on the chair the rope is tied

Once I'm dead my ghost will come and haunt you
Cause it's you, that committed suicide
It's you, that committed suicide
Cause it's you, that committed suicide
When IT'S YOU THAT COMMITTED SUICIDE
SAID IT'S YOU THAT COMMITTED SUICIDE

Just you, all you
Don't blame me I never can believe how stupid I can sound
For you, only you
It's obviously my fault why can't I? And figure out what's wrong with me
Just you, all you
I can never truly make you satisfied sometime I just wish I wasn't me
For you, only you
Maybe I'd be better off alone all I do is embarrass me
Just you, all you
Don't blame me I never can believe how stupid I can sound
For you, only you
It's obviously my fault why can't I? And figure out what's wrong with me
Just you, all you
I can never truly make you satisfied sometime I just wish I wasn't me
For you, only you
Maybe I'd be better off alone all I do is embarrass me
Just you, all you
Don't blame me I never can believe how stupid I can sound
For you, only you
It's obviously my fault why can't I ? And figure out what's wrong with me
Just you, all you
I can never truly make you satisfied sometime I just wish I wasn't me
For you, only you
Maybe I'd be better off alone all I do is embarrass me
