As I lay the silence is deafening
The quiet is volume 10, it's happening again
How do I stop my brain from shaking me up?
Oh, why you waking me up?
I'm Larry, I'm J's fear
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be here
I hope I don't get in trouble for rapping
And I hope that girl don't get pregnant we're tapping
Would you mind getting out of my head when I rap?
But what if our records are whack?
And what if I flop, man I don't know shit
Larry you worry about to much bullshit
Thanks for your rap though
Was it ok?
Yeah, but when I rhyme they wanna hear Violent J
'Cause I deliver the swift axe chops
Ummm, can we stop?
Hello, I'm J's soft side
He never shows affection and makes me hide
My name is Plush and I'm barely used at all
Ahhhh, what's happening ya'll?

[Chorus]
I have no control of me
Mood or personality
Chemical Imbalances
They control me randomly

What up playa? The name's Captivity
I'm J's chick boning ability
Being that we ugly it ain't a peice of cake
But we get off and shit
Mmmm, somebody help me I'm falling apart
Personalities are pouring out of my heart
Just pay me no mind, I forgot my pill today
Are you sure we're ok?
Look here motherfucker, get it right
Or, we gonna be a virgin the rest of our life?
Why you telling them shit? Go fuck yourself
Hey buddy, he's only trying to help
I should be mad, you never go my way
That's cause your a fucking pussy ass, and I'm Violent J
But I'm not going crazy, I'm just being funny
Yeah right
Help Somebody

[Chorus]
I have no control of me
Mood or personality
Chemical Imbalances
They control me randomly

Juggalos I'm sorry, I'm out of control
I got personality issues fo sho
All I ever wanted you to hear was Violent J
Well excuse me then, I'll get out of your way
Wait I'm sorry Fred, Tell them about you
Well I handle the smarts for our Mr. Bruce
I once read a book, I have a ninth grade degree
And who we kidding you don't even use me
Relax already, don't get pissed
You know who's probobly here in the mist
All we need is Butch showing up here
Too late pussy, throw me a beer
The name is Butch I'm J's anger, and well
Get me pissed we going to jail
Easy man, here have some Nyquil
Leave the beat downs to Billy Bill

[Chorus 2x]
I have no control of me
Mood or personality
Chemical Imbalances
They control me randomly

Stop Them!!!
