Welcome to the Dark Carnival

Violent J
Shaggy 2 Dope
The Insane Clown Posse
Will live forever (Live forever)

Join us (Live forever)
Follow me (Live forever)
Carnival awaits us (Live forever)
Take my hand (Live forever)
Take my hand (Live forever)
Shangri-La (Live forever)
Live forever (Live forever)

[Verse 1: Violent J]
Here go another clown song, freaky and weird
I'm still preaching - I'm like Noah without the beard
I'm trying to spread the facts that I know for sure
Yet many don't believe in our carnival freakshow
It's alright though, there's enough who do
And only time will tell if our stories are true
But for everybody here I can promise you this
You'll never hear us rap about the typical bullshit
Bling bling, all the money they got
All the ice they wear, and all the people they shot
All the freaks they pull, and all the cars they drive
Only we rap about fucking a beehive
You wanna keep it real? Walk out your door
That's as real as it gets from the sky to the floor
But the Dark Carnival will take your soul away
And give you mythical adventure in a magical way

[Chorus]
I live for The Carnival
I die for The Carnival
I pray for The Carnival
Please take me away (take me away)
I love for The Carnival
I die for The Carnival
I pray for The Carnival
Come take me away (take me away)

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Funhouse, freak shows and murder-go-rounds
Fuck how you looking, paint it up like a clown
Loosen up, let it go, you ain't gotta be tense
Faygo flying everywhere, fuck making sense
And that's the beauty of it, look backstage
Ain't another group out here on the same page
Run with everybody or walk with our crew
And stand on the moon, face the world and say "fuck you!"
I ain't sitting out playing that star biz
Put me in the crowd where my Juggalos is
Treat me special I'ma leave your lip draining
We in this together waiting on the same wagon
Let them laugh now, let them laugh for years
We'll see who's laughing in the house of mirrors
Cause that's where I'm going and if you're not
Bump that other shit and hear about the ends they got

[Chorus]

Live forever
Take my hand
Live forever
Live forever

[Verse 3: Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope]
Come take a journey through heaven and hell
See what we have to come, and share the story I tell
Walk hand-in-hand with the devil and God
Let them pull you in half, purgatory is alright

Fuck newspapers, fuck magazines
Fuck A&Rs, and their ball-hugging jeans
Fuck anybody trying to change our ways
As long as 6 Joker Cards got something to say

I speak for the crazy, I speak for scrubs
I speak for the thugs pissing in your hot tubs
I speak for the people that you always say don't know how to act
We like them just like that
Fuck your Grammys
Fuck your music awards
I strangle your host with his microphone cord
Fuck anybody that ain't down with the clown
From now until millenniums after I'm dead in the ground

[Chorus X4]
I live for The Carnival
I die for The Carnival
I pray for The Carnival
Come take me away, take me away
