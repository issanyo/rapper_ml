[Intro: Violent J]
"I think it's funny how, the toughest criminals and thugs
And whatever,when they on their deathbed, you know like the day before
They fry in the electric chair all a sudden they wanna get religious
I heard like 9 out of 10 inmates on deathrow are all...ultra religious
That's because they know they're about to die and meet what's ever after death
It's funny, nobody want's to turn to God until it's too late
Until it's time for you to fuckin' die."

[Violent J]
Agony, pain, suffering, pain pain
Pain, pain, chains, devices and torture thangs
Is this hell, well, might as well be
It's what's next to that shit, I live life filthy
Sexed every bitch in the gutter, then we rob her mudda'
Find the shudda', then shoot bowa' for each other
I paint it all on the people around me
It's because of them God never found me right?

[Blaze]
Before I hit the ground when I caught 3 in the chest
I should'a guessed my time was over, should'a worn a fuckin' vest
But I wasn't thinkin' straight, caught up in the thug life
Once the king on the streets, now I'm askin' God to take my life
To the pearly gates so I can rest peacefully
But he wasn't helpin' me, why is he foresakin' me?
To eternity of hell left to rot in the grave
And if it wasn't for the Lotus, i'd still be there today

[Hook]
Call upon your God's, beg for them to help you
Call upon your God's, religion has left you
Got a final hour, cross the final line
Life will end, but there is no end to time

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Skin separates from bone, seperate from bone
One hot flash of metal, now you're on this earth alone
Layin' face down in your own blood with nowhere to turn
Everything, from your fingertips to toes burn
Heat set's skin deep, open up your eye's
The cold clutch of death's hand, he could care less about your life
As Hell's chariots comes to carry you away
You finally realize, it's to late to pray!

[Monoxide]
Help Me Out!!
I can't understand the way you think or what your talkin' about
I see you sittin' perfect circles, wit' deciples of Satan
I got my shotgun cocked, news papers and revelations
Every bullet is a story, they keep it glorified
The media's the target, and now they got's to die
Son of Sam, Sam of Son, buck you wit' my shotgun
Wicked work will be done, fuck it catch a hot one

[Hook]

[Jamie Madrox]
There ain't no end in time, you hear me heathen, bitch boy?
Bite your devil tongue before I stab you with this pitchfork
All that shit you talk about, my God is ashamed
Cryin' in pain, callin' his name
Your such a hypocrit, a low-down, inconsidrate
Piece of shit, and you ain't worth an ounce a spit
Blasphemous dissin' my Lord, and clocked out
Where's the tough guy, that told my Lord to go and fuck himself bitch?

[Marz]
All of my life, and times, all of my crimes
It got me lookin' for the sign that God's alive
Cuz' there's gotta be, more to this life than knives
And coke lines, the violent crimes
I've realized, that they lied, cuz' God's alive, he's inside of me
There ain't gone' be no afterlife where their judgin' me
I ain't scared of death, I ain't scared of life
When I die, I'm gone' smile, bring it on, it's a good day to die
