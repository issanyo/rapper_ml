[1. Beautiful Doom]

[Hook]
Beautiful doom
Bang! Pow! Boom!
Beautiful doom
Bang! Pow! Boom!
Beautiful doom
Wonderful doom
Beautiful doom

Everybody dies, gargoyle skies
Main attraction is your own treachery and lies
Carnival arise, facing your demise
Cuz the acid rain came with a Boom! Pow! Bang!
And the purpose of the circus is definitely clear
Get you in the mirror cuz soon you'll be here
Sweat with the boom, don't forget to assume
Time catches up with some beautiful doom

[Hook]

(x6)
Time catches all of us
Surpassing everything

Tents pop up cause the show's in town
And everybody knows what goes around
You're a three ring act, let's hope it suits ya
Your past and your present will determine your future
No White Witch can save you, no potion
And six times deeper than the Indian Ocean
Life goes by with a Bang! Pow! Boom!
And then LOOK OUT! Here come the beautiful doom

[2. Freaky Creep Show]

We got the blood that oozes slow
The sickos and creeps, this carnival
We got the screams that shiver your spine
The hatchet that hacks the meat out the swine
We got the spiders, they're spawning and spawning
From the head to the shoulders they crawl on the dead
We got the axe still stuck in the head
We got two dead bodies fucking them here
We got that wicked what you needed more
At the Dark Carnival Creep Show

[Hook (x2)]
Scary, demented, and crazy, so check out our
Freaky Creep Show
Mad'ning and eerie and you'll wanna go to the
Freaky Creep Show

We got that paint for the smile we wear
We caught a witch and cut off her hair
We got them gloves that choke the neck
We got them six, the Joker's Deck
We got them drums, demonic guitar
We got your last breath in a jar
We got the killers who stalk you down
Tape out the scene and chalk around
We got that terror you been looking for
At the Dark Carnival Creep Show

[Hook]

Scary, demented, and crazy, so check out our
Freaky Creep Show
Mad'ning and eerie and you'll wanna go to the
Creep...creep...creep...creep...

[3. The Clowns Are Back]

Back to the big top
Back to the crowd
Back to the cannon blasts, we loud
Back to the tightrope
Back to the lions
Back to the acrobatics flying
Babies crying
Spectators scared
Ape boy, jugglas, lady with a beard
First one to go
Red mist hit the front row
The clowns are back in town
Hellooooooo!

[Hook]
Oh! We back again
It's happening
We back in town
So come on down
We got yo ticket
We got that killer candy
And if you like it wicked
This circus ain't like any

Bang!
Pow!
Boom!

T-t-th-the mesmerizing
Hy-hy-hypmotizin
Evo-evolving Dark Carnival
I-i-i-is back in To-o-o-o-own
W-w-w-way up that sloppy, loopy bi-itch ass of yours

Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado
The throat chokers, cut-throat jokers
Juggalotus and you know this
Most hated band on the planet
So fresh they can't stand it
Dark Carnival minions
The Duke of the Wicked
And the Southwest-side Stranglord himself
Big Violent J, and Sugar Shaggy2Dope
The wicked-wicky-wocked-wicky-wicked Clowns, bitch!

[Hook]

Sha-a-a-a-aggy Shaggs, Violent J, and Mike E. Clark!
Psychopathic Records, bitch!

Bang!
Pow!
Boom!

A-a-a-a-a-a-all across your sweet ass lips
Motherfucke-e-e-e-e-e-e-er!
