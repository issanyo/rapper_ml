[Verse 1]

Anomaly

Ima whip the motherfuccin' magic


Constantly off of the shit like colostomy
Shawty be all up on me

Ouija got the severed head

Ima have to (?) is happening
Chop it up to sorcery what can you offer me
Some

Follow me you are my property gotta be

You can't label the way that I'm banging slangin' with the flavor

With the bangers

That make you crank up and wake up the neighbors take a grenade and then gage and



Fuck bitch in the anus and slap they face with ya dangus
For my all killas thats waiting to see they face in the papers
And all my bitches who (?)
For all my misfits and oddities born to scoff at the labels
They want us all in a box but the'll never fuccin' contain us

(Violent J)
Wooooo! haha Call it whatever you want the fucc you want!
This shit is fresh!

[Chorus]
