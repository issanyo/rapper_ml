[Intro: Shaggy]
Die, bitch! FUCKING DIE!

[Verse 1: Violent J]
All night find me robbing your jewels
Setting fires, damaging, and breaking into schools
In the darkness it's much easier to be heartless
Break the window out the Lincoln and screwdriver start this
Mugging people, dropping on them from street lights
Stab them with garden tools or beat them with pipes
So don't come out, stay inside cozy and tucked
And if I'm breaking in, your old ladies getting [fucked]

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
All day, car jacks, get out the van
As soon as they step out, I pop them anyways (BAM!)
I rob liquor stores with a little .22 hold
I know it's nothing, but it's something when it's busting at your nose!
Sunny days, I hit up the beach with cleats on
I stomp bitches in their ass, trying to tan in their thongs
All day, see me fucking hookers at truck stops
And then I kill them, 'cause that's where my buck stops

[Violent J:]
All night, I'm wicked and I've got the power
Blood sheds on the wall during the witching hour
In the darkness see me ride by in an Impala
Dragging some funky ass by the foot and hear him holler
In the nighttime, I take what's rightfully mine
I run through emergency rooms and sever life lines
Fuck the limelight, I'm the one I need to impress
With a double tip swinging axe chop to your chest

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
All day, I'm selling coke laced joints to little kids
I'm a clown in a milk truck handling biz'
In the sunshine, I've been known to take shots at the pope
In the bushes with the camouflage on and rifle scope
All day, I'm wicked, I keep it horrifying
Axe murdered some kid and his dad kite flying
I knocked the fucking mailman out on the grass
And burnt holes in his face with a magnifying glass

[Violent J:]
All night, I fly like a vampire bat
And murder people telling stories where the campfire's at
Blame it on the moonlight or blame it on the boogie
I shot the motherfucking sheriff and his deputy rookie
When it's dark out, I hit the streets in the shadows
And grab yours and boogie the woogie and stab hoes
Don't even give me a pound when you see this clown
You getting cut the [fuck] up and chopped the [fuck] down

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
All day, catch me picnicking with bitches in the park
Right before I ice pick them in the heart 24/7
If it ain't us, it's somebody getting bloody
Wicked clowns ain't the only ones nutty, buddy
Catch me tongue kissing a severed head
Catch me burying another bitch dead behind the shed
It doesn't matter, night or day all around the clock
Violent J and Shaggy chop, chop, chop, chop, chop

You're going to die!
