[Verse - Violent J]
In my mind's eye
You throw wickedness at me
I'm just a toy to you
I bring no real joy to you
The way I see it
You don't want me here no more
You want a hole in my forehead
And blood pourin' on the floor
'Cause I'm so dirty
Fuckin' dirty and shoddy
I want up out of this body
That's hated by everybody
Sometimes I don't know why
I continue to try
It's so much easier to die
Than to get by
And to get by
And to get by...

[Verse - Violent J]
If I'm gonna die
I'm taking you with me
Get you and get me
We can be bloody
If I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna succeed
Take you and get me
We can be bloody
Sometimes I don't know why
I continue to try
It's so much easier to die
Than to get by
And to get by
And to get by...

[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]
I don't wanna leave my house
Don't wanna open my mouth
Don't wanna read my mail
Don't wanna meet with pals
I don't wanna fuck shit up
Don't wanna fuckin' get up
Don't wanna take up space
Don't want your time to waste
I don't wanna fight this back
Just wanna fade to black
Don't wanna turn to faith
I wanna burn at stakes
I don't wanna build my life
I wanna bloody my knife
Don't wanna grab the phone
Don't wanna leave this room
I don't wanna talk with you
I'm fuckin' stalkin' you
Don't wanna fix myself
I wanna nix myself
I don't wanna try to change
Just wanna fry my brains
Don't wanna slow shit down
I wanna throw shit around
I don't wanna run nowhere
Don't want no one to care
Don't want another crack at it
I'd rather be a crack addict
I don't wanna look for help
Don't wanna help myself
I don't wanna even try
To get by
To get by...
