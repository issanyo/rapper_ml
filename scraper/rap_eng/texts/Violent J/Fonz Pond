[Verse 1: Violent J]
Off Lickity Trail, there's a pond were many a children died
It's a place to run to and disappear, a place where some folks hide
But they will tell you about the rumors that swim around this lake
Some say there's something in the water and thus are no mistake
The fog that rides along the top has been said to carry voices
Those of the dead who took the dare and jumped in, they made bad choices
Some have seen and others heard and they say along the bottom
Are all the bodies of the girls and boys preserved, remaining, half-rotten
The water's thick with murky mud, the weeds are red like splattered blood
In this pond a spirit cries, snakes and bugs replaced his eyes
Some don't believe and dare to swim, something under will pull you in
Hidden deep in the wild brush, if you know where it is then hush...

[Hook: Shaggy 2 Dope & Violent J]
We almost there
Don't pull me in the water!
At Fonz Pond
Don't pull me in the water!
At Fonz Pond

[Verse 2: Violent J]
Off Lickity Trail, there's a pond
Where many a children perished
The water is black, even in the sunlight
Deep and dark, nightmarish
Some believe the bodies surface
And bask underneath the moon
Others say they seen a headless boy
Stumbling around the lagoon
The loons scream all night long
Sounds melodic, sings you a song
Missing children, swampy deaths
Mysteries are secrets kept
Staring out are snakes and frogs
Leaches living off hollow logs
Something's watching from the water
It took the missing sons and daughters

[Hook]
It's over there
Don't pull me in the water
At Fonz Pond
Don't pull me in the water
At Fonz Pond

[Bridge: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Fight for air!
Something strong is
Pulling me under, pulling me under
Fight for air!
Something strong is
Pulling me down
Fight for air!
Something strong is
Pulling me under, pulling me under
Fight for air!
Something strong is
Pulling me down

[Verse 3: Violent J]
Many terrifying horror tales
Emanate from this one place
Several children, young boys and girls
Disappeared here without a trace
What you believe and what you don't
Is entirely up to you
But if you go up there and swim alone
You'll know exactly what's true
Something's dragging through the mud
Mosquitoes attracted to the blood
They say the dark depths have no bottom
Some never came back up and got em
Crazy kids come party here
It swallows more souls every year
They jump right in and disappear
Best to stay away from up here
At Fonz Pond

[Hook]
There it is
Don't pull me in the water
At Fonz Pond
Don't pull me in the water
At Fonz Pond

[Bridge]
Fight for air!
Something strong is
Pulling me under, pulling me under
Fight for air!
Something strong is
Pulling me down
Fight for air!
Something strong is
Pulling me under, pulling me under
Fight for air!
Something strong is
Pulling me down

[Hook]
There it is
Don't pull me in the water
At Fonz Pond
Don't pull me in the water
At Fonz Pond
