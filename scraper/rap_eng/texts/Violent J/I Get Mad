[Intro]
Keep on, just keep fuckin' doin' it
Make me knock your whole fuckin' head off!

[Verse 1]
Somebody's always starting shit that I'ma have to finish
In my life I'm like a land mine and you a dancing menace
Always stepping all up over me, pushing all my buttons
Talk a million words up in my ear and never saying nothing
Always wanting something outta me and never giving back
Never caring that you bother me, you oughta get a slap
My blood pressure's high enough to kill me as it is
I'm running with the Shore they can hear you all up in my biz
Aggravation, agitation, my levels rise
When I unload and finally explode, don't act surprised
Like you never seen it coming, all my warning whistles blowing
Anger growing, no controlling, when I'm steamrolling

[Hook x2]
I get mad! (I'ma fuck you up)
It's me and you motherfucker! (I'ma fuck you up)
You done fucked up now! (I'ma fuck you up)
And I'mma fuck you up (I'ma fuck you up)

[Verse 2]
Smack your head against the wall hard a couple times
Pick you back up off the floor and throw you into the blinds
You fly right out through the window but then I jump out behind you
Kick you in the fucking gut and face when I find you
There's commotion, people gather watching you get hurt
Witnessing me stomp your whole head into the dirt
They tell me "that's enough" and step in, that's when I draw my weapon
Joe Bruce Lee with nunchucks like this is Game of Death
I'm splitting skulls so quick, it's like they barely seen it happen
They grab they head with both hands trying to stop it from cracking
Cause when I lose my cool and blow my top that's all it takes
Me and you my foot in your neck until something breaks

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They hit me with a tranquilizer dart and shocking me with tasers
But still I'm throwing kicks and punches faster than lasers
Fifteen coppers on me like a mini fucking army
They can't harm me cause I'm madder than a mutant zombie
One by one I throw em off me like a raging gorilla
Pissed off like a rattlesnake, roaring like Godzilla
And flipped they cars over, somehow got away clean
And didn't show my painted face again until the Gathering

[Hook]
