[Verse 1: Violent J]
Bitch, I'm here to tell you I lied
When I seen that thick-ass it was over
Nothin else mattered, I ain't even care
I pulled the rubber off when I stuck it up in there too
Bitch, I lied to you, this ain't my home
Kicked in the back door and now we're alone
I stole the car that I picked you up in
Plus me and your girl have been fuckin
Bitch, I lied, everything I said to you
All steps to land in your bed with you
My watch is fake, this ain't my coat
And I sent you letters that my brother wrote for me
Bitch, I lied, everytime I left town
I really stayed right here at home
Dickin hoes down, every penny that you helped my mom
With went straight to the asian spa, bitch

[Chorus]
Hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
Look how you turned out to be
You're no prize, no prize
Hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
Look how you turned out to be
You're no prize, girl, no prize

[Verse 2: Violent J]
Bitch, I lied, I didn't buy you that
I stole you that, and then I stole it back
It ain't no mr. right without a mr. wrong
First, and you fucked up and met mr. worst
I fucked a hooker and left skeet on your backseat
And kept on and never missed a beat
And bitch, I lied, my name ain't lance
I lied my way in and outta your pants
I never played football for michigan state
I lied to your neden and it bit the bait
I never won a medal for winnin a back stroke race
But bitch, I lied to your face
I'm the motherfucker that stole your momma's purse
And watched you and your daddy blame it on her
I lied everyday of our lives to your ear holes
(you look really good when you wear those)

[Chorus]
Hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
Look how you turned out to be
You're no prize, no prize
Hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
Look how you turned out to be
You're no prize, girl, no prize

[Verse 3: Violent J]
Bitch, I lied, about so much shit
Half the shit, I forget
I tell you new lies to cover the old
I throw hot new shit on top of the cold
Flip the script up and talk you blind
Backwards, re-enactment, rewind
Tangle the topic, have you blamin you
For the fucked up shit I do
I told you I owned a mcdonald's in thailand
(and you bought that shit, damn)
I told you that al pacino was my man
(and you bought that shit, damn)
I told you a whole lotta shit cuz I can
(and you bought that shit, damn)
You're no brize, bitch, no prize

[Chorus]
Hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
Look how you turned out to be
You're no prize, no prize
Hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
Look how you turned out to be
You're no prize, girl, no prize
