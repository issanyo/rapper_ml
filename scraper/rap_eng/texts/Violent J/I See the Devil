[Verse 1: Violent J]
I see the devil
Everytime I fuck a bitch
Tell her I will call her
Throw her number in a ditch
Lie to her face
Just to get my dick blowed
15 minutes later
Tell her hit the road

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I see the devil
Everytime I stomp somebody
Run from the scene
With my fists all bloody
Me and my boys
Beating them down in the street
The devil was right there
Watching like sweet

[Verse 3: Violent J]
I see the devil
Everytime I lie to my mom
Whenever we argue
I go off like a bomb
Tell her she don't
Understand shit about me
Get in the car
With my homies and flee

[Verse 4: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I see the devil
Everytime I score some meth
He's standing
Right behind me like death
Every hit that I take
He claps his claws
Just like he does
Everytime another soul falls

[Hook: Young Wicked]
Running outta time
Looking for the light
Something isn't right
The devils grip is tight
Cause I'm Running outta time
Leave it all behind
Cause my souls on the line (ooh ooh oh)
Can't nobody hide
From the devil inside

[Verse 5: Violent J]
I see the devil
Everytime I take what ain't mine
Whether big or something small
He tells me its fine
He tells me to snatch it
Cause its so apeling
When I lay down at night
I see the devil on the celling

[Verse 6: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I see the devil
In every bag of dope I sell
Every dollar I make
Brings me closer to hell
I got bitches on my dick
And money to spend
But every road that I take
I see the devil at the end

[Verse 7: Violent J]
I see the devil
Every time I drink and drive
I see him right beside me
Telling me to get live
He tells me to floor it
I try to ignore it
He laughs when we crash
And everyone's bloods pouring

[Hook]

[Bridge x2: Violent J]
I can't run
I can't hide
He's outdoors
He's inside
He's right here
And I swear
He's claiming my soul to bare

[Verse 8: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I see the devil
Everytime I look in the sky
I see the devil
In the sun and the moon I won't lie
I see the devil
In my own face looking in the mirror
I see the devil
In my crew like he's standing right here

[Verse 9: Violent J]
I see the devil in the walls
The devil in trees
The devil on my back
I hear I'm in the breeze
I seen the devil
Bealzabub with horns and a tail
But I'm looking for god
I don't wanna go to hell

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Insane Clown Posse]
Can't find it
From the devil inside
I said I'm sorry
From the devil inside
No! No!
From the devil inside
Noooooooooooooooooo!
Can't find it
I don't wanna go to hell
Can't see hell
I don't wanna go to hell!
Where to go Where yo go
Noooooooooooooooooo!

[Hook]

[Outro: Violent J]
What have I
What have I found
What have I

I hear new sounds
I feel my
My heartbeat pound
What have I
What have I found
What have I
What have I found
I see new sight
I hear new sounds
