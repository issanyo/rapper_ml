Ladies and gentlemen, you've all come a long way to be here tonight, and we say welcome
Welcome to the Dark Carnival's very extraordinarily special presentation
You have been personally selected to witness this once-in-a-lifetime, breathtaking, bomb-ass event
Live, and in person! Right here! Right now!
Without further ado, please welcome the dynamic and explosive Dark Carnival superstar attraction himself!
This is BANG! POW! BOOM!

[Hook]
With a Bang!
(BANG!)
Say goodbye to everything!
Your complete annihilation is the reason he came!
And a Pow!
(POW!)
He's wiping everything out!
Turn your whole fucking world into a mushroom cloud!
And a Boom!
(BOOM!)
It's your inevitable doom!
Nobody escapes, and everybody's consumed!

Welcome to the Dark Carnival super-show
You're our specially invited guests, and I'll tell you what fo'
Cause you're the evilest pedophiles, rapists and abusers
All together we've got fifty thousand of you losers
You're all about to witness an incredible sight
Nobody's ever lived to tell about it, and don't think you might
It's about to rain flames, frames and brains
To be blown into pieces is the reasons you came
Racists, bigots, wife-beaters, judges and cowards
All crowded together, expecting a show and some dollars
But instead the shit you're gonna see, you'll fear it in Hell
It's a constant explosion, see and feel it you shall!

[Hook]

In the deserts of Nevada, where nothing else matter
It's the perfect place for you and your intestines to splatter
And while Bang! Pow! Boom! steady stomps you all out (Hehehehehe!)
You in the hail for the nuclear fallout
With the snakes and fakes, creepy sneaks
Hoods and crooks, horny freaks
Shady ladies, Evil Ernies
Richy Ricks and Charley Cheaps
Bang! Pow! Boom! They say the show is the bomb
I heard it's straight up explosive, some even call it napalm
Nobody battles back, this ain't no kind of war
It's a one-way execution, blow you straight to hell through the floor
What the fuck you think you here for? Sound the alarm!
Ladies and gentlemen, eat shit and die! Let's bring him on!

[Hook]

The air is thick with sick from demented brains and thoughts
But here they are, all together, every one of them caught
This is a celebration, in that the Carnival's cheering
It's not too often Bang! Pow! Boom! makes and appearance
And the winds in the sky will carry away all the ash
But for now let us enjoy the big back-splash!

[Hook (x2)]

It's your inevitable doom!
Nobody escapes, and everybody's consumed!

With a Bang!

And a Pow!
