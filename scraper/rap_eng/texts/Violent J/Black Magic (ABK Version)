"Wizards, witchdoctors, sorcerers, black magic! God bless Mike E. Clark, ICP, Twiztid, and most of all, all you Juggalos and everyone at Psychopathic Records and even you! The sixth Jokers card will be followed, followed by the end of time itself! It will consume us all!"
Hooragoon, feed the rats
Hooracool, skin the cats
Meckle Heckle Lucifer

Meditate
Body weight
Humiliate
Castrate
Contemplate
HATE
Decapitate
Segregate
Poison, venom, vixen, pleasure
Vortex, vomit, vulture, treasures
Hex of fire, hex of pain
Hex of losses, hell will gain
Blood of children, blood of pig
Dig, Solomon, dig dig
Dig your grave
Be my slave
A lot of wicked spirits rave

(Chorus)
Blackest magic leave my soul
Give my angels all control
Blackest magic let me be
Keep your black tongue off of me
Blackest magic drop your chain
May you never speak my name
Blackest magic, watch you cower
Bite your tongue and holy power

{Softly}
Why, when people witness magic...
They'll ignore it and say it never happened...
Only thing they'll believe is what's tragic...
God flows and nobody wanna catch it...

I go East, you go West, and the moon follows both of us {it's magic}
Pyramids, circle crops, hunded stone hedge crops {it's magic}
Volcanic lava, earthquakes, weather causes aches {it's magic}
Music, love, the unseen drugs, fuckin' lightning bugs {it's magic}
Hypnosis, ESP, mental telepathy {it's magic}
Amityville, northern lights, blood red moon lit nights {it's magic}
Rings of Saturn, the black hole, mind over body control {it's magic}
Exorcisms, Mary's cryin, unknown objests flyin' {it's magic}

(Chorus)
Frozen fire, call me down
Frozen fire, show me around
Candle wax, drip like tears
War over 1,000 years
Monkey blood, sweet and hot
Take me to my spot
Wait, devil has my tongue
Heaven's bells have now rung

{Reverse message}

Blood of children, blood of pig
Dig, Solomon, dig dig
Dig your grave
Be my slave
Let the holy spirits rave

(Chorus)
