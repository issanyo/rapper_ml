[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Showed up in a red stretch hearse full of vampires
Blood red rims straight rolling on flat tires
Screeching to a halt sparks spitting at the paparazzi
Reload your flash bulbs for the dead bodies
Seven bitches and human abominations
Lined up behind the velvet rope waving they invitations
One by one they all pile in, find they seat and wait for the ceremony to  begin
And when the lights fall, it's just like night fall
Unable to see a single thing in front of your eyeballs
All you can hear is the screech from the audience
As the victims up in the pits get robbed of they innocence
Shit, I love the terror I'm in VIP
With these vampire bitches taking hits of mutant ecstacy
Spill the blood, the torch is lit
Compared to the Monster's Ball your bash ain't shit

[Chorus x2]
Now who wanna go to the ball (I DO)
The wicked ass monster's ball (THAT'S WHO)
Tell me who wanna go to the ball (I DO)
The horror's been here right here just for you

[Verse 2: Violent J]
The suit's ready, my super skin is made of dead hooker ho's
Tattoos still in tact, bitch take a look at those
I showed up the dead woke when I pulled up
Walked the bloody red carpet, behind me it rolled up
Checked my name at the gates bitch, I'm Veedy Peezy
I died for these tickets, it wasn't easy
It cost me my soul, somebody said the reaper's the DJ
Pitch black is the dance floor, A deadly see way
Creatures and hotties, people stepping over dead bodies
Demons above pissing fire on the party
Give me a triple shot of snake blood, two times
A ceremony of freaks and creeps and blew minds
Somebodies eyeball landed in my drink, I chugged it
Cause in this place we all ugly kid
Spill the blood, cause if the torch is lit
Compared to monster's ball, your bash ain't shit

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
I pulled up in a pickup truck with warewolves
Came out leaning on a cane made of deer hooves
I'm covered in blood and holding a grudge
Against these motherfuckers from who I am constantly judged
We down in homie, tonight's the night
We all come together and celebrate the end of your life
Awarded for the evil, and spite
Inaugerated for the demonic sanity portrayed when I write
How can I say it, I'm just so elated to be here
Paparazzi flashing they pictures wish they would leave here
Carpet covered in carnage and red like licorice
And every step you take you keep hearing the blood squish
I just saw this chick who was missing her cheek, chin & her lip
Handing out free drinks and cigarettes
It must be starting the torches are being lit
The monster's ball is the shit and your ass ain't invited biotch

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 4: Shaggy 2 Dope]
My arm extended elbow bent, ho's can't ignore
Clutching to the pass stone pimp glass across the floor
Floating everywhere, it's sheer elegance
Five years expired still scrubbing, still late for rate
Make a hole in the dance floor it's time for rug
Cutting my bitch booty up and I'm cee walking
Secret hand shaking, straight teen wolfing
Grabbing titties that feel like drips of pudding
But you gotta love it, it's invite only
Checking my neck for vampire bites on me
Can't get the fucking hustle started though
Come on man there's less limbs missing on Vietnam Veterans
I saw Doctor Jeckel spiking the punch with fermeldahyde
Doubled down and got smacked by Mister Hyde
Without an invite, motherfucker don't come
Monster's Ball's in your mouth get the FUCK ON

[Chorus]
