Its time for change
I think I'mma take all the bullshit around me and plug it
Right into the black hole, the fucking asshole of the universe!

[Violent J]
Take the hate you show me
Fuck ya homie
Tell ya girl
Shes good to blow me
Shes alone cause your head up ya ass!

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Give me back all my attention
Constant bitching
Booty switchin' herpe itchin'
Hair extension
Shove it up her ass!

[Violent J]

[Hook]

Hooded faces
Crimes of hate confederates
The human waste
Cram it back up the ass (it fell out of)

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Take the mental pain
The constant rain
I lose no game
Stress on the brain

And stuff it up that ass!

[Violent J]

You on his lap

Up it goes!
Touch your toes!
