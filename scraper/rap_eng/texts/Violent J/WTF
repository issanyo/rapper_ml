[Intro]
This kid Freddy is just as good as any kid in the world right now
Like any kid dude
Splendid

[Verse 1]
So we're gonna build the wall and shoot the aliens out huh?
The fucking long way homes the safer route huh?
The kids are dying starving from the drought
They found a dead girl with her brains dug out huh?
They executed the wrong man the other day (Again)
They checked his DNA after it wasn't him
Another nuclear disaster mass toll haha
Some asshole dropped his wrench off the scaffold
Another little kids body was in a grave
Her head was missing, later found in a microwave
The worlds a giant battle royal of turmoil
Pillages on each others villages in burning oil
The heat increases
The brain bakes
How much more pressure can it take
Shaking, how much weight til' it gives way and breaks

[Chorus]
What the fuck
What the fuck
What the fuck
(Hopefully, I'll get popped off soon with any luck)
What the fuck
What the fuck
What the fuck
(Hopefully, I'll get popped off soon with any luck)
Life is a wonderful thing like living on this beautiful planet we've been given
(So fucked up!)

[Verse 2]
So a bullshit cooker ass kicking coke sniffing joke graduates
Throat slitting and committing rapes
It escalates but they catch him til' he escapes
He takes the bracelets off snips em and breaks
Half the country are closet racists
Disgraces hiding their demon faces
Concealing their horns and pitchforks
Satanic bitch whores and devil dorks
The government tells you "milk is good for the bones!"
When all it really gives you is BONES
It don't make them hard it makes them soft
Just cut out the middle man and blow my head off
The heat increases
The brain bakes
How much more pressure can it take
Shaking, how much weight til' it give way and breaks

[Chorus]
What the fuck
What the fuck
What the fuck
(Hopefully, I'll get popped off soon with any luck)
What the fuck
What the fuck
What the fuck
(Hopefully, I'll get popped off soon with any luck)
Life is a wonderful thing like living on this beautiful planet we've been giving

[Verse 3]
So that church is full of that bullshit donor
You just paid for viagra, the preacher's boner
And he ain't buy it for his sweet wife Judy nah
He rather some of that little boy booty (Ha Ha)
So they can install a breathalyzer in your car
And they can have drunks up the street tomorrow
Picking up health care and cure for cancer and AIDS but fuck that shit every one of them pays
The prisons are too crowded huh? Fresh!
Butt rape will start in 2 months or less
And if he's on his best behavior like he oughta'
He's out even quicker to slaughter your daughter
The heat increases
The brain bakes
How much more pressure can it take
Already shaking
How much weight
Til' it gives way and breaks

[Chorus]
What the fuck
What the fuck
What the fuck
(Hopefully, I'll get popped off soon with any luck)
What the fuck
What the fuck
What the fuck
(Hopefully, I'll get popped off soon with any luck)
Life is a wonderful thing like living on this beautiful planet we've been giving

So Fucked Up
WHAT THE FUCK
