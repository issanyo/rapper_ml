[Verse 1: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I don't wanna die and burn in hell
I wanna live honourable and do well
But how? How do I stay on path
When I see somethin' fucked up I wanna laugh?
How do I honour my dead beat father
Who walked out on two kids, like why bother?
And left my mother with poverty, fuck my dad
I wanna slaughter thee
Look at this world and all the Gods
How can I not look at all the odds
You got Allah, Buddha, Jehovah, Jah, give praise
However you was raise
How do I not wonder who's right or wrong
How do I keep my believin' strong?
How do I make it to Shangri-La
When the worlds so fucked up? Damn it's hard

[Hook: Young Wicked]
How do I live a beautiful life
When all of this darkness has covered my life
How could this be you said was a lie
How will I know if I done good in your eyes?

[Verse 2: Violent J]
I'm asking "how?" How can I ignore the hotties
How do I not check their slammin' bodies?
How do I stay faithful and quit the game
When I doubt my wife is doin' the same?
How in the fuck can I not have any
Drive a bucket and I want a Bentley?
Live in a trailer and not envy
A man who's got a mansion sittin' on land
Is this a joke?
How can anybody with nothin' see the rich and not be salty
And what if some psychopath had my son?
How can I not just grab my gun
How can I not have adrenaline buzz
Aim and blow a hole where his eyeball was
I saved my son, he's alive and well
But I killed a man am I goin' to hell?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shaggy 2 Dope]
How can I actually be a saint
How can I live and be somethin' I ain't?
How do I not steal, when I'm dyin' of hunger, and I end up under?
How do I just turn the other cheek
When I'm disrespected, slapped and beat?
What's wrong with fightin' back and winnin'
How come if I'm not a punk I'm sinnin'

[Verse 4: Violent J]
How can I pray true and true
When most of what I pray for don't come through
And what about science and all the facts
How do I keep my faith in tact?
How do I not lie when the truth is painful
Embarrassing, harmful or shameful?
How do I not live afraid of hell
And be happily content my soul is well?

[Hook]

[Outro: Young Wicked]
If I've done good in your eyes
If I look good in your eyes
If I look good in your eyes
If I look good in your eyes...
