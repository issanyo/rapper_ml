Jingle my mutha fucken balls bitch
Insane Clown Posse back in this mutha fucka
Hey yo Violent J, whats up?!

It's Christmas, time for a slaughter
Maybe your wife, maybe your daughter
It's midnight, I land my sleigh
Make way for jolly St. J
Climb down the chimney, for the murder
Dressed as the fat man everyones heard of
Shimmy down, shimmy down, what the fuck?
Somebody help me, I'm stuck
Now what to do? I feel whack
I got stuck in a chimney stack
But I hack, and shimmer on down
Santa Claus Clown
Can't fuck around, now
Living room, shhh, I creep
Tippy toes cuz they asleep
I pulled out the axe and slid down the hall
I got a gift for all of ya'll
Whats that? I better hide quick
Oh fuck, it's the real St. Nick
And he musta been taken a shit
But regardless, I better move quick, now
So I jumped him, Santa's no joke
Fucked around got my damn neck broke
He's strapped, he shot, he didn't miss
(Gunshots and ho ho ho)
I had a red Christmas

"I'm dreaming of a dead Christmas
The kind you'll never have again
Cuz if you have a dead Christmas
That means your dead and thats the end"

Merry, merry Christmas you fuckin chump!
Seasons greetings loser, yo 2 Dope kick it!

Jack Frost nibbles, ha! but fuck that
I ain't got a home so he nibbles on my nutsack
And my buttcrack, toes, and elbows
My nose is froze, fuck you hoes!
So I made a friend like me, a snow man
He was down with the clown like a pro man
Had a hat and eyes outta charcoal
And a pipe, we fill it with indo
Me and him sang songs in the snowflakes
He ate snowballs, I ate cornflakes
And we both would freeze our balls off
I was there every time his head falls off
I put it back on for him with a smile
He was my boy, made from a snow pile
Then the storm came, a blizzard
Snow, wind, ice, a blizzard
We pulled through we hid in an alley
The next day it was like sunny valley
He was meltin and I was just fine
He got pissed and pulled out a nine

"If I'm gonna die you should come with me
Cuz we're boys" (gunshot) It hit me
Damn I'm dying, I'm dead he got his wish
And all I got was another red Christmas

"Silent night, violent fight
Now I'm dead, one to the head
Christmas this year seemed so whack"

Happy New Year bitch boy
Hey, I got a New Years resolution
For your chicken face mother
To kiss my motherfuckin' ass, Woo!

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Ask your fuckin' mommma bitch
The ICP don't play, hey
Wicked Clown, Wicked Clown
Bitches drop your drawers
Don't talk back just suck my sack
And fiddle with my balls

Yeah, ICP, Southwest for life
Christmas time you know what I'm sayin'
Mr. Kris Kringle, you fat bitch
Mutha fucka never gave me shit
I'm a slap you across your
Red ass face mutha fucka, uh!
Southwest down
