[Intro {Violent J}]
If I'm gonna die
I'm going out riding the wagon

[Violent J]
Hear it comes, the horrifying midnight wagon
Saggin', laggin', dead bodies draggin'
On a piece of string, they flop around and fling
Now shut your ass up and let the juggla sing
It's the Insane Clown Posse coming through
Looking for the hickies and the prickies and your ass too
Everybody gets a ride in the ghost car
Don't matter who you are, we going straight to hell
And it ain't far, Mr. Nevers, you seem to be the kill joy
So get your ass in fat boy!
You can sit up in the front with the Ringmaster
With the ringading-dingalinga-ping-master
And get your motherfucking wind pipe chopped off
And your funky ass body gets dropped off
In the gutter, the wheels keep rollin
Throwin heads out the back, nugget bowlin from the...

[Violent J]
The exhaust pipe is tripping out a deadly fire
I found an old dead corpse in the trunk next to the spare tire
And it's muffling the sounds
Throw that bitch out and now the funk pounds, yo
Some say it's just a hearse, but it's much worse
It's an old dark bucket with a clown curse
Long, dark, very spooky scary
I drink an old 40 bottle full of bloody mary, why?
Cuz I'm Violent J, sick in the nug-bone
I make strange sounds, clowns with frowns
Break it on down, break it up till the break of dawn
Look out your window it's the wagon in your front lawn
Ah-boom! Aboockaboomba!
We do the dance of the death until you get in the car
And then I pull your tongue out slap you in the face with it
Say the joker did it in the...

Wagon Wagon, dead bodies draggin
{Now, here's your chance}

[Violent J]
We don't do drive-by's in the wagon
Instead we just get out and stab your fuckin ass
And there ain't no telling how many clowns inside
Told you seventeen but I lied
Cuz I'm wicked and I'm wild, wicked wild
I caught a wild deer, rode it home from Belle Isle
I play the organ like an old mental case
I can freak the cello, like Chris Conley on bass
In the wagon, I throw fingers out the window
And when you roll the window down you can smell the indo
But it ain't mine, it belongs to the stiff over there
Puffin' on a Jim Square
Heavy long, rumbling, tumbling
Step into my ride and your ass goes stumbling
Out the back with your neck in a rut
Gotta get home before the sun comes up on my...

Wagon Wagon, dead bodies draggin
{It's your last chance!}
