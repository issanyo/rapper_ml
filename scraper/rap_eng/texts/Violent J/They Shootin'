[Verse 1:]
A bullet flew through my window and shot my clock
I ran out on the front porch and stood there shocked
They all out here shootin up and down the street
I joined in on the action and blast my heat
Rat-a-tat, automatic, attack is sporadic
Shot two more hoods and a stray crack addict
Take time to reload as guns explode
Bodies and bloodstains all over the road
I called a police, he came with sirens
Pulled up on the lawn, and saw me, and started firin
I barely escaped, I ain't seen this comin
But everywhere I turn in the city, they gunnin
All out and...

[Hook:]
(They shootin!)
They shootin bullets at my fuckin head! (Listen!)
I said they shootin bullets at my muthafuckin head!
They all mad!
Ba-bam, bam, bam, ba-bam, bam, bam
Ba-bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!
[2x]

[Verse 2:]
People all on they roofs runnin and shootin each other
Ya wife, ya mother, ya brother, any muthafucka!
Guns out and blast, it's all in the air
Random bullets whizzin off of shit everywhere
I shot a bitch in the ear hole, I'm under the curse
Old ladies and priests shoot it out in a church
I'm shot twice in the leg, but I'm all the way live
If this is Armageddon, fuck it I'mma survive!
Two clips, a .45, and double-barrel mossberg
Aimin straight for they chest, fuckin cost nerds
Everyone's armed with intentions of harm
Fuckin do not remain calm, sound the alarm!

[Hook:]
(They shootin!)
They shootin bullets at my fuckin head! (Listen!)
I said they shootin bullets at my muthafuckin head!
They all mad!
Ba-bam, bam, bam, ba-bam, bam, bam
Ba-bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!
[2x]

[Bridge:]
Ba-bam, bam, bam, ba-bam, bam, bam
Ba-bam, bam, bam, ba-bam, bam, bam
Ba-bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
Ba-bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam

[Verse 3:]
I felt a pellet gun plug me in the back of the neck
A little kid wit red eyes, I blasted him back
All lights been shot out; it's dark out here
Listen to the hollow points whistle through the air
No two people seen workin together
As soon as they load up, they blast on each other
I'm dumpin on anybody movin at all
I'm wounded, hidin in the back of a strip mall
The nights get quieter as time moves on
Less people alive, nobody moves at dawn
Anyone caught slippin gets picked off quick
The worlds goin out on some pissed off shit

[Hook:]
(They shootin!)
They shootin bullets at my fuckin head! (Listen!)
I said they shootin bullets at my muthafuckin head!
They all mad!
Ba-bam, bam, bam, ba-bam, bam, bam
Ba-bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!
[2x]

[Outro:]
Ba-bam, bam, bam, ba-bam, bam, bam
Ba-bam, bam, bam, ba-bam, bam, bam
Ba-bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
Ba-bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
