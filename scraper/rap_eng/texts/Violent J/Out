Let me off the Terror Wheel
Shut up bitch
Looks like it's nighty night time
Only some of you won't be waking up
Ahahahaha!
As for the rest of you
Sit back, put on your PJ's and nighties
While you hear the story entitled Out
Ahahahaha!
What the fuck is up?
I'm in the haugh
And Violent J's finna tell a story
So sit your ass down
Shut the fuck up
And get stoned motherfucker

Well I'm waking up so early cause I knew this day would come
My daddy's passed out with an empty bottle of rum
Although she's been gone long I do not miss my mother
And he's a sorry fuck so there's nothin in the cupboard
My little brother's starving, hungry, and sick
Cause ain't nobody coming by the house giving free shit
So he gettin kinda skinny and my brother's almost dead
Got no other choice but for milk and bread
Stepped out the house for the first time in 2 years
Cause my neighborhood it ain't really good
Lay up in my bedroom night after night
I hear screams, zombies shootin and lootin
But now here I am and I'm walkin down Jefferson
With a bag of moneybacks I don't understand
How the world can be full of so many evil doer's
I can hear 'em underneath me in the sewers
Keep seeing shit out the corners of my eyes
Steady lookin over my back I didn't realize
Where I was goin
I didn't wanna bother anybody
Accidentally stepped on a dead body
Hey motherfucker watch where the fuck you're goin (Sorry)
I might be dead, but I'll kick your ass
Now I apologized but he still had to talk shit
So I stepped over his face and kept walkin
And here's the part of my story that get's really scary
Had to walk alone down Military
I can see the crackhead's hiding in the trees
Lookin for some change
Lookin for some brains
Everything seemed too quiet as I walked down the block
Until I got hit with a rock
Can't really tell I musta been out for quite awhile
Cause when I woke up my Nannycoat was outta style
And the crackhead's took my moneybacks in a dash
And ripped off my arm in the process
But fuck that shit I still gots another hand
So I can still get the shit for my little man
And I'mma walk with my nuts hangin out
I ain't scared, but this is where it get's weird
Factories, toxic waste, and chemicals
They have strange effects on the animals
In my neighborhood and some get a lot bigger
Like the giant rat that jumped on my back
I'm runnin like a maniac all through the ghetto zone
And it's steady takin bites out my nug bone
Wrustling around and found it's tail
So I straight bit it
Then it ripped of my leg and broke with it
Tried to catch up but I couldn't move quick enough
This little trip to the store is straight fuckin me up
But that's ok cause the store's just down the block
So I hop
And it seems all wrong as I look up in the sky
I see the vultures waitin on me to die
But I made it to the store so fuck all you hoes
Peep out the sign
Hmmm Closed
Picked up a mailbox threw it through the wall
Cause I'mma get my shit so fuck all y'all
Took a loaf of bread and a carton off the shelf
Even took a Faygo 2 liter for myself
Walked out the store like a cheap ass when I heard
The click-click sound of a mossberg
The store owner he didn't like a beat and eat
That's why he didn't see a problem with buckin me
Blew my muthafuckin head off my shoulders
Didn't say nothin kept buck buckin
But I gotta say I made it home in a heart beat
Nobody fucks with a head rollin down the street
Now I think about it was a full man when leavin out
Now I'm a head with a loaf of bread in my mouth
Bouncin up the stairs
I knock on the door with my chin
Hey yo little man won't ya let me in?
And best believe it was good to see my little brother
Hey you forgot the milk you dumb motherfucker
Lock the door behind me cause I'm back on route
Back to the store and I'm out

Uh, uh, who's pussy is this, bitch?
Uhh, who's pussy? Yeah
Eh, what the fuck are you looking at?
Ain't you ever seen pussy before, stupid ass?
Slap that ass bitch
Oh, uh, oh, hey
How's it happenin' again?
Hey this song right here
We're ready to slow it down and get a little sexy, ya know
As 2 Dope tells ya how he stuck her with his wang
Woo haha!
