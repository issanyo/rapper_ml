[Intro: Psychopathic Robot]
(Wicked Clowns are invading you)

[Verse 1: Violent J]
I'm Violent J, Papa Killjoy, I can't be fixed
I'm a crooked ass clown with some filthy tricks
I killed hot bitches out there but I grow weed plants
So every time I hit the blunt
It's like I'm hitting that ass

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
And I'm Shaggy, throwing heads in the air by the hair
I bounce them off my heals while people cough they meals
I kick heads like soccor balls and do tricks with them
I get hotter than a globetrotter, twirling and spinning

[Violent J
I sick with it with a sword, I can balance and stand on it
Killed many men, one swing in the end
I'm so quick you won't see shit but the guy's eyes wiggling
And me in the Bruce Lee stance giggling

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I rob liquor stores at night when the workers are tired
I run up in that bitch swinging chainsaws on fire
And I can balance on a ball while juggling all your limbs

[Violent J]
While rest of you is chained up in a chair watching him
Under the big top

[Hook]
We have so many tricks to show you (Come down)
So many freak shows to go to (Come down)
So many eyeballs to throw
Your soul you're quick to drop
Under the big top
This wicked shit we flow to (Come down)
So many dead souls we go through (Come down)
Inside Hell's Pit they throw you
Let the fire get to know you

[Verse 2: Violent J]
Violent J is a man that can end your life
And then wear your slippers and fuck your wife
You get a pie in the face, a fucking pie in the face
Then you get cut up and sent to your momma in a suitcase

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Bitch I'm Shaggy clear outta my squares
I ride a bike backwards in my underwears
I tell human stories to ghosts and I dead the awake
Plus I'm trapped in the other side of the mirror I think

[Violent J]
Twenty five chairs stacked up, I'm on the top
Fucking balancing on my head, I'm about to drop
And I'm holding up a bear on my foot that juggaling
All six in the mix, will this be the end?

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
This will the end of my dick all up in another bitches ass
Wicked clowns will make the wicked shit last
And I kick a dick's ass trying to stop the shit
Icepick to your temple than pop your shit
Under the Big Top

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Violent J]
I'm Violent J's a juggla, pillow faced smuggla
You recognize my voice? I'm in a ski mask mugging ya
I can walk on stilts 900 feet high
And than drop a dart down straight into your eye

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Well I'm Shaggy Shaggs, I went from rags to rags
And I've received many meals out your garbage bags
I can do backflips all the way up a wall
Swinging an axe, that was the last thing that you saw

[Violent J]
I can slit your throat from across the room
Throwing a Joker's Card under the light of the moon
And then I hook my feet onto your swinging ceiling fan
With two swords and yell for everybody else to come in

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
You can split me in the middle or saw straight down
You have two one legged halves of me jumping around
You can cut them in half, you have four of us fuckers
My limbs all crawling and attacking like brothers
Under the big top

[Hook]
