[Intro]
Spells, you gotta be careful with
Spells, it’s real black magic in these
Spells, you can’t fuck around with those...

[Verse 1: Violent J]
Needed a tough potion to make her think Im hot
This spell’s a piece of cake, easy to pull off – not
Put a shell of a tortoise on a burning flame
Need a couple chicken, you know, dig out the remains
Toss it into swampy souce of snake heads and frog legs
Mix it with a dog sling and sacrifice a small pig
As Im chantin unga bunga baga wu, which means
Make her love me and I give you my soul
Like it’s fuck what happens with me after I die
This august my life is fly and can easily get by
Shit worked, and at first I couldn’t be more proud
But she was crazy, fuckin bitch broke into my house
I tried to leave her, she takes out every chick I meet
She won’t go to sleep until she swallows my skeet
Right now I can’t be alone, stuck on a leash
The only way to turn it off was to kill the freak

[Hook]
Spells, you gotta be careful with
Spells, it’s real black magic in these
Spells, you can’t fuck around with those...
You don’t wanna get hurt (2x)

[Verse 2: Big Hoodoo]
I got a spell to get back at all of your enemies
Follow to the tea and they all die off like the Kennedys
At first dash of salt, red mustard and a bat tooth
A baby lizard, chicken gizzard and some cactus juice
Fermented fish eyes, pepper and a couple roaches
Just make it simmer for ten minutes until it smells atrocious
Then mix rose oil with blood from a vulture
And a pinch of Spanish moss and powdered sulphur
You all confused, but to me it makes perfect sense
To try the spells on that ho ass neighborhood snitch
The next day he died and I was proud of my magic
When I heard the news, I pretended it was tragic
But I was happy inside, smile curved on my face
Until I looked in the mirror and saw him in my place
His spirit haunts me and I can’t do a thing to shake it
Cause once spell has been cast, can’t nothing break it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I’m fuckin Shaggy the clown bitch, that’s my name
And if you hear it, you better know there’s voodoo in my veins
I’m talkin way back, takin bottles to the store
There was a stand in the alley, one there wouldn't never fall
Some kind of fortune telling gypsy, I said how about a weed
I sat down and laughed at her, cause none of this I believe
She called me a clown and ordered me to pay attention
I tried to listen but couldn't put the bullshit she mentioned
I said I’m seventeen, old enough to know you phony
She said the reading’s over, now you paid the money
I told her fuck you, I ain’t payin shit
She cut a strand off my dreadlock and said you pay with this
Then she hexed me, then I forever be a clown
But the thing she didn’t realize, shit, I’m down
Wherever the lady is today I wanna say thank you
Even though you probably dead in hell in a demon’s when the demons spank you

[Hook]
