[Verse 1: Violent J]
I'm in an old station wagon, deep in Alabama
Wipe the sweat outta my eyes, cock the hammer
I see a pickup truck with a rebel flag window
A skinny redneck with one of his kinfolk
I pull up along side and blast the passenger
Blood, feathers and bone, a massacre
I kept shootin', hit the driver
He fell on the horn, stuck
Threw a Molotov cocktail and blew up the truck

[Hook 1: Violent J]
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
Out here pretending like you ain't offendin'
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
You redneck judges with racist grudges
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
If you got a tattoo, I'm aimin' at you
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
You get punched in your faces, reppin' the racists

Confederate Flag
Confederate Flag
Confederate Flag
Confederate Flag

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
The judge, grandpa, dad and three sons
All of 'em KKK, they can't run
I blew a head clean off, it rolled, still in the hood
The headless horseman fell dead in the woods
The rest of the Klansmen ran cause' they were scarey
It was Tim the banker and the barber Larry
All pussies, threw off their hoods, they cried "please"
But they were devils, so I capped their knees

[Hook 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
That shit represents a hateful sense
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
If it's in your back pockets, I'm aimin' my rockets
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
That's what you wanna wave? I stick you in your grave
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
Stick your fucking flag pole right up your fag hole
Confederate flag
Confederate flag
Confederate flag
Confederate flag

[Verse 3: Violent J]
Rednecks call it pride; pride for what?
White pride for slavery, it sickens my gut
I see that flag as a challenge, that you want to fight
You don't care who it offends, you say it's your right
Well it's my right to sock you dead in your lip
Put a foot on your neck, and tell you "eat up a dick" (BITCH)
No matter where you live, you should hate that flag
Cause it represents evil bigots, tell em' Shaggs

[Verse 4: Shaggy 2 Dope:]
One, two, three rednecks on a ladder
Hangin' up a rebel flag, it don't matter
How many of ya, because we don't love ya
Stick you in the dirt, tombstone above ya
There's juggalos all over the south that don't wave it
Proud of where they're from but that flag, they hate it
Cause they understand it's a symbol of slavery
One flag reps us all, it means bravery

[Hook 3: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
I'll turn a redneck into a deadneck
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
Cut the head off a chicken, give 'em an ass kickin'
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
The holes in your t-shirt, fill them with pee squirt
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
Redneck fuckin' meth head, tuck you in your death bed
Confederate flag
Confederate flag
Confederate flag
Confederate flag
