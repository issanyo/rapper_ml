Ay
Ay bitch ay
Hol up hol up hol up
(Wassup girl?)
(what the fucc you mean?)

[Verse 1]
You don't even wanna know how my days been
On the hunt for them they tried to keep me caged in
Ran through the woods, No destination
In a timber something happened
I do not remember
All I know I grabed my shawty accidentally killed her
I tried to change my shirt and ripped it I dont get it uh
Brain fidget uhh
Bear hands swinging uhh
Limbs ripped, Guts drip
Can't fucc with it uhh
I am dizzy every fuccin' body round me dripping
Moshpittin' and this condition so unforgiving
Why is it that when I kill someone I tear them limb from limb I'm tripping
Bloody blur my vision
I need my prescription
Gotta get it
Tore through the pharmacy
Shouting the alarm on me
Cops getting called on me
Nonstop slaugthering
Everyone in here is dead its okay got the quantity
Found a hound dog too and got a lot of lean remembering that

[Hook]
Yeah I killed him and I did that with my bear hands
Step up in this motherfucca with my Bear hands
Flexing on yo clique I kill em' with my bare hands
I ain't talking bout my hands homie I got Bears hands
Uh I kill em' with my bear hands
Uh I kill em' with my bear hands
Uh I kill em' with my bear hands
Flexing on yo clique I kill em' with my bare hands

[Verse 2]
In the aforementioned woods I was running scared
Stopped dead in my traccs when I seen a Bear
He ain't move not a wink he just fuccin' stared
I was in a straightjacket so it wasn't fuccing fair uh
When in his hair shit my pants right fuccin' there
I tried to book it he was quicker caught me by the river
Homie Yogi rushed me ripped my jacket straps I shuttered right
Then Shaggy came
Popped his fuccin' melon open
Twist, twist broke his paws at the fuccin wrist
Cut a tree in half with em' swoosh I can get used to this
Ran up in thie dope mans crib clawed up all his friends
Then I took around that bitch and found all his xans
Tried to roll a blunt with Bear hands, you understand
Few hallucinogens broke the bottle on the Juice and Gin
Blacced out fucked his girl clawed her bacc out
Woke up in the traphouse
Twenty throats slashed out uhh

[Hook]
Yeah I killed him and I did that with my bear hands
Step up in this motherfucca with my Bear hands
Flexing on yo clique I kill em' with my bare hands
I ain't talking bout my hands homie I got Bears hands
Uh I kill em' with my bear hands
Uh I kill em' with my bear hands
Uh I kill em' with my bear hands
Flexing on yo clique I kill em' with my bare hands
