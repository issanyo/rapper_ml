It's one of those nights (another one of those nights!)
The night of the 44
2:30 in the morning, and I'm fully loaded

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Fully fuckin' loaded bitch!

[Violent J]
I ran into a gas station, and blew somebody head off they neck (*gunshot*)
I thought it was a dream but then I look and see that I'm a bloody wreck
I can't run to my mama's house, I know that she would never understand
I might as well be a man and finish what the fuck I began
I walked out and started walking away like I ain't seen a fuckin' thing
I went across the street and walked up to the drive-thru window at a Burger King
I knocked on the glass and the kid leaned out to tell me they were closed (*gunshot*)
I blew a hole in his face and his boy was like
"Damn, you got hosed Tommy you got hosed"

[Hook - Shaggy 2 Dope & Violent J]
I feel ready to die but it's taking so long
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)
I just keep movin' on, keep tryin' to stay strong
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Shoot they bitch asses!
Thinkin' they ain't about to get shot!
Man fuck that!

[Violent J]
I started hopping through backyards and ran into a 7-11
Jumped up on the counter, aimed my shit and blew a hole in his melon
I dragged his body in the back and did the same to everybody again
'Til the walls and the windows got so bloody, wasn't nobody comin' in
Police started surrounding the building and I ain't got no hostages
But I fronted like I did, holdin' up some dead kid
I said I'm comin' out, they said "don't bother" and started shootin'
The corpse I'm holding up ain't got no head and they ain't stupid
I ran into the back and started drinkin' Drano bottles
Gettin' high as fuck, I'm going out in a hail of bullets full throttle
I loaded my shit again but I never had a chance to shoot
Somebody blew my head off, all I heard was "Whoooff!"
On the night of the 44..

[Comedian]
Who hasn't gone on a PCP binge
And shot at a couple of cops?
I mean, c'mon!
