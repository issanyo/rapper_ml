[Verse 1:  Violent J]
Oh, you'll never guess what's up
My muckin' head blew up
My chin's in a old man's back yard
I gotta snake through his yard to find the fothermucker
And he's got a pitbull dog
And it's sittin' on my chin like a frog on a log
I throw a bone to try to distract
'Cause I'm wantin' my chinny-chin-chin back
I'll never be one to boast
But there's my tongue hangin' off the light post
'Cause my head exploded
And my brain's unloaded
All over this beautiful city
Teeth and bones to the nitty-gritty
There's my eyeball stuck to the wall
Right next to my splattered jaw
I don't dig this game
Chasin' my brains all through the sewer drains
My head's all over the block
'Cause I done went lunatic-tock, tick-tock
Come on dog, what's wrong with my head
It blew apart but I still ain't dead
I get no respect
I got nothin' but guts hangin' off my neck
But I'm still chillin'
Even with my blood and guts all over the ceiling

[Hook] (x4)
I'm chillin', I'm illin'
With my guts all over the ceiling

[Verse 2:  Violent J]
Oh, you'll never guess what's up
My muckin' back blew up
If you come across a spine
Best believe it's mine
Oh, forget about my tongue
'Cause vato can't breathe without no lungs, heh
I lost both of mine
Now that's an item that I wouldn't mind to find
But forget about that
'Cause I'm roaming the streets with a splattered back
Trying to rap to this freak
But she can see my ribs all in the street
Then the chitchat went dead
She noticed that I ain't got no head
Shh, I think I hear my heart
But damn, it got hit by a SMART Bus
And landed in Pontiac
So I tell my mellow to send it back
Come on, why did my back blow up
Look for my guts, look for my guts
I got a call from Nate the Mack
Says he might have found part of my back
Then bring it on over, ace
I got slabs all over the place
But I'm still chillin'
Even with my blood and guts all over the ceiling

[Hook]

(Southwest ghetto zone done blew up my head
I got no back, ha, but I ain't dead
Southwest ghetto zone done fried my brain
I got no head, said I got no head)

[Skit:  Violent J, 2 Dope]
"Hello?"
"Yes, can I speak to a Joe Bruce please?"
"Yeah, what's up"
"Hey, check it out man, Lacy said he seen your large intestines, man!"
"For real, where they at?"
"Hangin' from a telephone wire on Vernor and Junction!"
"Cool, man! That's for real?"
"Yeah, man!"
"Alright man, I'm about to go get them down then, I'll give you a call!"
"Alright, man!"
"Alright."
"Check you out, dog!"
"Bye."

[Outro:  Violent J]
You'll never guess what's up
I'm down on my luck

Got no head, said I got no head
Southwest ghetto zone, it done fried my brain

[Hook]
