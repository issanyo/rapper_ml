[Verse 1]
I'm running racing, freeway chasing
Climbing fast increase the pace and
Pick this shit up come on with it
Rip this shit lets gone and get it!
Heart beat riding picking up motion
Spark that shit chase that explosion
Catch that action feed me thrills
Wipe that sweat up pop them pills
Death is closing in we crookin'
Turn that fire up I'm cookin'
Panic lookin' twitching climbing
Trouble I'm in, tragic rising
All surprising, sound of sirens
Peaked the pressure, weapons firing
Mash to the pedals, crank that shit up
Beat the clock, lets rock so get up

[Hook]
Why can't I settle down?
(Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!)
Why can't I slow it down?
(Pick it up, Pick it up, Pick it up!)

[Verse 2]
Sweat is burning up my eyes
And up the center lane I'm flying
Hyper speeds I'm slippin' quick
I'm swiftly falling off the cliff
I turn the wheels with no control
Into the blackness of this hole
And peep the ticker, pull the trigger
Past the bullet falling quicker
Barely breathing, super speeding
Interweaving through the treason
Ultra foward nitro levels
Deeper than the reddest devils
Rocket fuels on an a behaviour
Mental meltdown ain't no saviour
Feel the blast, shattered glass
Fire it up! I'm moving fast

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Faster, Higher, Burning, Fire x2

Lose control much (Faster)
Take me up much (Higher)
Put me out i'm (Burning)
Set my brain on (Fire)
X2

[Verse 3]
I tried the drugs, can't relax
Here comes the train I'm on the tracks
Here comes the bullet and I'm stuck
Tell me why I'm always fucked?
Another tragedy inside
Nowhere left for me to hide
Ain't no place to get away
Ain't no way to save the day
Ain't no cover from the rain
Ain't no escape from the pain
Ain't nobody I can blame
Why am I fucking insane?!

[Hook x2]
