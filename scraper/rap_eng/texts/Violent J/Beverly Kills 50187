Jugglers, come out to play...

[Verse 1:  Violent J]
Guess who's coming to your big town
Juggling jesters, kick it clown
Circus sound, painted frown
Carnival of Carnage creeping round
I'm Violent J and I'm sick
They try to run me down
But you know I'm too slick
And I slip and slide like a Slinky
Slip and slide with my Twinkie
Welcome to my world
As it winds and it twists
I'mma kick a funky little rhyme that you missed
Boo-loo-chewy-wewwy-doo-boo
And you'd be fucked up if that was really Voodoo
Come see the wonder, the show of your life
See me breathe fire and swallow a knife, right
I ain't swallowing nothing, Jack
But I can juggalo like you never thought you'd ever know
And we packing that funk
With a snap and a clap, and a jump, jump
So chicky chicky freak if ya want to be down
Step on up and kiss the clown

And kiss the clown
Kiss the clown
On up, kiss the clown
Step on up and kiss the clown

[Verse 2:  Violent J & 2 Dope]
Stop the bus
Violent J comes out
Barrels to your face
And blow your fucking face off
'Cause you know my mind is gone, dead, oh
Happen to catch me a Beverly show
Body fell asleep but my mind goes on
Welcome to the world of the Juggla's dome

First day I enrolled in the high school
Butt naked with a axe
("Wow, he's so cool!")
("Stand up and say your name, tell us about yourself.")
My name's 2 Dope and I cut necks all to Hell
Dylan, Dylan, I'm trying to find Dylan
I'm finna cut his throat with a carnie, carnie killin'
Rich boy never seen a ghetto joker-o
Slap you in the head with a sledgehamm-o
Sorry Dylan didn't mean to knock ya
Then I stuffed his dead body in my locker
To the next class don't want to be late
Finna ask Brenda on a little date
I heard this bitch likes to fight in clubs
Took her to a mud match, threw her pair of gloves
Watched her get her ass beat by a fat dyke
And left the muddy ass bitch there for the night
Woke her in the morning, threw her in the trunk
Threw her in the trunk 'cause the dumb bitch stunk
How you doing Brenda
Mind if I bend ya
Over, rover
("Do me like Bundy.")
I'm sure you'd like that, you little skank
And when I finished
I stuffed her fucking head in a fish tank

Oh, that's a beautiful aquarium
Yeah, hey you want to see it
Hey uh, here bitch
Oh wow it's lovely
Yeah, yeah, yeah have a closer look
Hey, die bitch what's up
What are you a lung fish?
W-what's up Aquaman?
Die bitch, die
That's right, bitch


Back to the school
Fat bitch in the locker
Couldn't fit her booty in
So I cut her booty off
Sometimes I feel like I'm burnin' in Hell
Throwing up chokin' on Delray's smell
Fuck those fucking fucks up
Rich fucks, man, fuck those fucks
Beverly Hills is Beverly Kills
I'm gonna bring ghetto carnival thrills
Where's that other little rich little fag
Looking for Brandon cause we can't stand him
I know [?] like boys like the bass go boom
But shh, you can hear him jacking off in the boys room

Ugh, ugh Dylan
Ugh I want your anus
Ugh, you're so hot

Kicked in the stall
Then I kicked in his jaw
Kicked him in face
And I kicked in his balls
Punk tried to run but he couldn't, tried to wobble
Bust him in the head with a empty Faygo bottle
Took him to the staircase
Jumped on his face
Rode him down the bumpy chase
Can I hear him breathe one last note
Stuffed his back down his throat
Back to the locker
Boy, oh boy, oh
Back to the locker
Stuff the fuck in
Back to the locker
Boy, oh boy, oh
Back to the
Fucking stuff the fuck in

Walking down the hall and I'm feeling like the shit
'Cause all that's left is one skank ass bitch
Kelly, Kelly, your neden's kind of smelly
Funk down your legs, and up through your belly
But I'm with Delray
So funk don't fade me
Let me hit it man
You're finna kick the can

Come on, bitch, man
You're getting ready to die anyway
Bitch, calm down
Let me get a little poontang
You know what I'm saying
Let me get a little trim, bitch
You finna die

Okay, 'cause I'm not a raper
But you still make morning paper
Kelly Found Dead In Her Bathroom
Naw, Kelly Found Dead In Her Dad's Room
No, Kelly Found Dead In Her Back Yard
'Cause Kelly choked on a Joker's Card
Smashed up bodies chilling in my locker
Kelly wouldn't fit
Chop, chop, chop, chop her
Oh no, Principal know what I'm about
'Cause one of Dylan's sideburns was sticking out
Oh shit, they chase me
'Cause they found the bodies
Now I run my ass off
Yeah they're getting mad
You can hear them cuss
Didn't look both ways, and got hit by a bus
Crunched up under
Tangled in the wheels
Spit me out the muffler
You know how that feels
Lost both my legs so I'm running on my hands
Then I seen Prince so I clapped 'cause I'm a big fan
And straight busted my face on the street
And here come the police
And...
