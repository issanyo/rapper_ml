[Violent J]
Me and my scarecrow homie headed down the trail
A wicked clown impaled somebody bound to fail
They tried to hoe us and throw us a curve
Man I don't know
It's more curves in this road than up in Anna Nicole's fat ass
Walkin down the road , we played kick the can
And we thuggin', juggalug, buggin' on bammer
God damn it strange planet, can't stand it
Tryin to find the wizard in this candyland
It's lunatic stompin' in my Air Force Ones
But they scuffed on, hit em' with the blue and green mud

[Monoxide Child]
At least you got something on em'
Try using hay
I'm losing my shit
I'm getting shorter along the way

[Violent J]
Shit put on one of mine, you can hop that ass

[Jamie Madrox]
Nobody fucking move I want your money and cash
Don't even fuckin' turn around, don't look back smiling

[Violent J]
Damn it, even in Oz they thug whilin'

[hook]
You ain't safe
Ain't no one safe
You've fallen victim to thug whilin'
Even in your sleep and in your nightmares

You ain't safe
Ain't no one safe
You've fallen victim to thug whilin'
Killers on the creep is what your life is

[Jamie Madrox]
I'm made out of metal and aluminum foil
They call me Tin Tizzy
I drink 40s of motor oil
Which one a y'all holdin' [me]
You got weed
And all the folks around here smoke stems and seeds
And I need a little bit of that shit you got
Keep lookin forward or one a y'all are gettin shot
This is my part of the brick road
I'm painted chrome
If ya step in my zone then your shit is gettin stole
You say

[hook]
We ain't safe
Ain't no one safe
We've fallen victim to thug whilin'
Even in our sleep and in our nightmares

We ain't safe
Ain't no one safe
We've fallen vicitim to thug whilin'
Killers on the creep is what our life is

[Violent J]
"Yo, scarecrow"

[Monoxide Child]
"What up, dawg"

[Violent J]
"This is bullshit, I ain't even seen his ass"
"You better pull quick, cuz I ain't got shit out here as it is"

[Monoxide Child]
"So leave us the fuck alone and go rob the wiz"

[Violent J]
Yeah, he gots a Mercedes stretch Hummer navi-bus
All we got is this bammer and you fuckin with us
I turned around
What the fuck you ain't even got a gun

[Jamie Madrox]
I know, you think maybe the wizard got one

[Violent J]
Man, I can't even believe this shit crow
A tin man at that with no strap [I know]
What you know about heavy metal fool
A big gun

[Jamie Madrox]
I was just warming for when I really do get one
Take me with you to the wizard of all
So I can get mine too
I'm tryin to ride with y'all

[Violent J]
What you think scarecrow

[Monoxide Child]
We got the same paint on so that's cool

[Violent J]
But we all should remember the rule

[Hook]
We ain't safe
Ain't no one safe [nobody's safe no more]
We fallen victim to thug whilin
Even in our sleep and in our nightmares [thug whilin']

We ain't safe
Ain't no one safe [nobody's safe no more]
We've fallen victim to thug whilin'
Killers on the creep is what our life is [thug whilin']

[Repeats until end]
