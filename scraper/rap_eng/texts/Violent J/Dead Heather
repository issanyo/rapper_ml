I waited for what seemed like forever
To find a lova to whom I could be together forever
I could never leave my beautiful heather
We were home watching cops
They were settin up a sting
I looked to my left
And she was choking on a chicken wing
I don't know what to do
So I didn't do a thing

I could never leave her
I could never leave her
I could never leave her
I could never leave her
Even if shes dead
Dead
Shes dead
Our love could never keep us apart

And now shes dead
I know the morge truck
Would take her from me
I dragged her out by her foot
Searching for my trunk key
Peeled out and split town
Cause for her I'm a junkie
We are on 95 in the buick and we sailin
How long do I have with her now?
Shit, there ain't not tellin
If I choose to make love to her
Its like a tripple fellon

I could never leave her
I could never leave her
I could never leave her
I could never leave her
Even if shes dead
Dead
Shes dead
Our love could never keep us apart

I kissed her pretty face
We held each other all night
She was growing stiff
But i liked it
Her hug was tight
Too bad her face is forever
Struck with fright
Do we make love?
Wanna know if it happend?
Yes
Theres some fat and funky skin slappin
And that is one foul ass neden Im tappin
I love it

I could never leave her
I could never leave her
I could never leave her
I could never leave her
Even if shes dead
Dead
Shes dead
Our love could never keep us apart
