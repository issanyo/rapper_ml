[Hook: Monoxide]
There's no turning back now
Everybody's underground and they’re all gonna burn alive
You can't take it back now
Your life's on the ride to hell and there’s no time to say goodbye
Why does skin melt away
Your body and soul now slowly separate
Your body and soul now slowly separate

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
The ride has started
Blow a kiss & wave
Goodbye to your loved ones
You carts next for departin'
The chain pulls it and I can hear it click
The irony's thick, I close my eyes while stomach's getting sick
Faster and faster in circles we go
Your skin is tied to your skeleton from gravitational pull
And just as it feels it's about to rip or split at the seams
You realize this shit is not a dream, a hallucination
A vision, intervention, normal character flaw
When you fall to the dark side with a gun under your jaw
Shit can happen when you travel at fast velocity
You can change a whole humanity like subspecies
Got a hole in your head and your safety belt strapped tight
Sinkin' into the cushions and seein' the flashin' lights
You gettin' a little excited, thinkin' it's about to end
But this is how the shit begin

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Now you're still spinning in a circle, hundred miles an hour
On the dime it stops like somebody hit the power
Lights go out and all you can see
Are these camera like flashes and visions of misery
Could it be your destiny has always been heaven free
And the demon that came for you is the same that came for me?
Well this shit's about to start
Cause your seat belt's now a serpent that slithers off in the dark
Your body and soul start to part
And the only thing you hear is the beat of your heart
And your body hunches over, the separation complete
And you slowly start to melt in the flames of a dead heat
Disintegrated like cigarette ash
Blown away by the wind from a devilish laugh
All remains are now encrusted inside of a bad dream
That'll haunt you like the killa that’s living inside of me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Violent J]
(It's like falling!)
Only much faster
Rotten bastard on your way to disaster
No pit stops, no piss breaks
Devil pull you down through the cracks from the earthquakes
Blow your brain out, catch a quick ride
Fetch a swift lift, boogie through the echo side
On your way to the epitome of shitty
Like a watching a bully twist the head off a kitty
(Evil!)
You should know all about it
You couldn’t live your life without it
And it's crowded in the pool of snakes, in and out of your holes
Some thicker than telephone poles
Goin' on a hell ride in Lucifer's limousine
To the hot spot that we've never seen
And those who have, have never returned
Are still there being gutted out, fucked and burned

[Hook]
