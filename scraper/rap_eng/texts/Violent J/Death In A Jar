[Verse 1: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I caught death inside that jar like some invisible demon
It blew into my room, I can hear the moon screamin'
It picked me out at random, but they catch em, I planned it
It swept in through my window, I snatched it and canned it
The jar shakes on my table, it's power immense
I'm nervous just to hold it, this shit is intense
You're just a evil gust of wind, the deadly breath to exhale
I sentence you to jail, let this jar be your hell

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
I've caught death in a dixie cup
Tried to get me when I was fucked up
Gotta get it to a jar, anybody got a car
I can use, because I live too far to park
Death ain't come here lookin' to talk
He wanna stalk somebody in the dark
So somebody help me, help me somebody
Inside, in this cup is worse than them zombies
Maybe dig a hole, leave it inside, bury death alive
But if I don’t get it out of this red cup quick
Everyone here's gonna die

[Hook: Violent J]
(I caught death in a jar!)
And screwed the lid on tightly
(Death is just a breath)
But still it tried to fight me
Everytime you breathe in
Your last breath it might be
Now there’s more on the hunt
Daily and nightly

Death is just a breath x4

[Bridge: Shaggy 2 Dope]
And if you catch it, you can play with it
But don't let it go
Don't poke no holes in the top
Don't drop it, don't let it go

[Verse 3: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I got death trapped like a rat without the cheese
See me play him like a game of chess and win with ease
Watch as I spread disease with a wave of the hand
The plagues that riddle man, mine to command, can't let him in
Keep him enclosed in the mason, the case in glass
It zoom while I consume doomed souls, then I laugh
Can't let it shatter, if it does I'm gone soon after
Tortured by the one I've kept trapped like brain matter

[Verse 4: Jamie Madrox]
Caught death in a mixing bowl
With a plate on top like a make shift
Then I tried movin' that shit in a coffee can
With a skull that I've painted off on the side
Then it got free and I tried to grab him
But my hands went through, like I'm choking a ghost
So I turned on the fan, and then I grabbed the bag
And then I held it wide open, it started to blow, and it blew inside
Then I quickly tied that shit in a knot like a pretzel dough
And then the bag puffed up like a big balloon
And when I looked in his eye, it looked just like fog
Circlin', gigglin', thick, black darkness, sick by far
And then I pushed the contents of that bag into a mason jar

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
And if you catch, you can play with it
But don't let it go
Don't be sharin' it, take care of it
And don't let it go

[Verse 5: Violent J]
I have a glass pickle jar, inside I caught the grim reaper
Would of used a vase or a vahz but this is cheaper
Inhale him like some reefer, then put you in a sleeper
He was tryin' to kill me, but then I caught him, he's a keeper
Sealed it up with duct tape and wrapped it in a towel
Buried it in the backyard, but still I hear it howl
It's beyond something foul, evil hear it growl
I caught one but there's many more still out there on the prowl
Breathing it in while sleeping, eyes pop open, you froze
Just accept it, you’re dead, eyes slowly they close
But now I'm in control and kill it I must
Cause if I drop it and it bust, I'm dead in the dust!

[Hook]

[Bridge 3: Shaggy 2 Dope]
And if you catch, you can play with it
But don't let it go
And if you breath it for no reason
Don't let it go
