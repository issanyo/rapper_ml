[Intro:]
Catcher!

[Verse 1:]
Dreadful dust, gloomy sun
All blank, matter gone
Lifeless, vast, all done
Nature and trees, fallen
Grey skies, death, dead air
Nowhere, nothing's here
Except me, I'm in luck
Or am I? Cause I'm fucked
Roaming, searching, no man
Time unwinds, shit's so bad
Where'd it all go? Vanish
Replaced by agony and anguish
Flat surface meets the eye
In every direction I try
Though hazy, I seen something crazy
The yellow dot of a daisy

[Hook x2]
Oh shit, see the beaming of a daisy
Our will to survive, it's amazing! (Daisy)
Oh muthafucka, look it's a daisy
Our will to survive! (Daisy)

[Verse 2:]
Everything changed when I saw this
Blinking in the distance, flawless!
In my world of dusty plains
The sight of color rushed blood in my veins!
It stood out, flashing again
I can see it faintly calling me in
Like a lighthouse for a ship in the fog
I got excited and started to jog
Toward it, what the fuck is that?
Came up on it, fully intact
Grown out of the sands alone
Sprung from nothing, bringing it on
I smelled it, like magic cane
Euphoria of new life, straight to the brain
I haven't smelled anything for years
A new beginning is what this is

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3:]
I'll stand right here, near this
This shit means life exists
It all dried up, cold, tragic
Until now, a beautiful magic
Another chapter, a new chance
Light in the dark, here to advance
The dawn will come, life will flourish
As sure as it perished yesterday
And is there more around
Somehow spurting up outta the ground?
I thought this planet was done
A dead rock, floating abandon
I couldn't stand in, damned, hopeless
It all changes now that I know this
What brought this here, who
Decided it's time for the new?
The yellow head and green stem
Tomorrow, look what this means to them
Picture a jungle standing in the middle
It all starts right here with this one little...

[Interlude:]
Daisy...
