Ladies and gentlemen, we present to you, the afterlife, beauty at it's
Peak
All of this will be yours, unless you drinketh of the river."

Lift on up, glide across the forest
Turn right, find stones of solid gold
Power, you alone can feed a dragon
Just forget not, all that you've been told

I shall never, drink it from the river
I shall never, drink it from this hole

I didn't drink from the river
I did it all on my own
I taste and shared with my brothers
I told the rest to come on

COME ON
COME ON
COME ON
COME ON

Been to Heaven, it's just too bright for me
My blood, is way too cold for Hell
While I'm alive, keep makin it clear to me
They say listen up, you listen well
I will

I shall never, drink it from the river
I shall never, drink it from this hole

I didn't drink from the river
I did it all on my own
I taste and shared with my brothers
I told the rest to come on

COME ON
COME ON
COME ON
COME ON

COME ON
COME ON
COME ON
COME ON

I didn't drink from the river
I did it all on my own
I taste and shared with my brothers
I told the rest to come on

I didn't drink from the river
I did it all on my own
I taste and shared with my brothers
I told the rest to come on
