[Verse 1: Violent J]
I come beatin down the block and I crack the bedrock
Dishes drop, the shit comes to a (dead stop)
Motherfuckers think Godzilla's comin (the lights go dark)
The whole house hummin
My amps (draw energy) and wipe out the power
My beat transmits over radio towers
The woofers might suck all the air out your lungs
(If you stand too close) When the monster hums
People think a nuclear war is at they front door
When I got my volume only on four
(gas pipes explode) and the storefronts shatter
Killing these kilowatts is all that matter
Fuck the police, the citizens, and (fuck the judge)
I'll blow they whole house down with some old clown love
Those that have heard can't describe my bump
(They know)
There's something from the beyond in my trunk

[Chorus] - 2X
Na na na nana na na (boom) (all night)
Na na na nana na na (boom) (all night)
Na na na nana na na (boom) (all night)
There's something from the beyond in my trunk (boom)

[Verse 2: Violent J]
Straight off the freeway and into your city
With black swarm of cave bats (follwing with me)
They attracted to the hum that'll knock your brain numb
You keep lookin for the lightin (but it ain't none)
When my fuckin bass drops (the whole block hops)
Everything switch, stops, clicks, and unlocks
You gotta recalculate your computer
(Reset all your clocks) and reload all your shooters
My woofers blow down trees and then pull 'em back up
(Past the graveyard) as the tombstone crack up
Those that have heard can't describe my bump
(They know) there's something from the beyond in my trunk

[Chorus] - 2X
Na na na nana na na (boom) (all night)
Na na na nana na na (boom) (all night)
Na na na nana na na (boom) (all night)
There's something from the beyond in my trunk (boom)

[Verse 3: Violent J]
Fish jump out the water tryin to swim for the moon
Vibrational booms drying up the lagoons
My bumps pop fake titties and melt ice grills
Relocate your piercings (dissolve your pills)
Police wail on they sirens but I blow they tweeters
Illuminated liquid leaking outta my speakers
Each drop burns all the way down to the earth's core
(Dust devils) sweep across the earth's floor
Crows and ravens don't flap they wing
They just float on the waves that the humdrum brings
Those that have heard can't descibe my bump
(They know)
There's something from the beyond in my trunk

[Chorus] - 2X
Na na na nana na na (boom) (all night)
Na na na nana na na (boom) (all night)
Na na na nana na na (boom) (all night)
There's something from the beyond in my trunk (boom)
