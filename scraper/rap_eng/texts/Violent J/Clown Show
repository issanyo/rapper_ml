[Verse 1: Violent J]
Come one and come all, everybody know me
I'm the class clown all around and everyday the home me

When they beat me up in the gym

I was honored and privileged they’d let me be with them

And they smack my head up when I try to fix up my hair

I'm so funny
I amuse even the teachers always beat me in they yard and they just laugh from the bleachers

[Hook]
It ain't so funny when the shows over (ain’t so funny)
Storm blows over (ain't so funny)
And I

I got a standing ovation when I fell on my face in the class
Somebody shoe-laced my ass
They spit on my seat
They spit in my food
They spit on my face this audience here is rude
Well I stepped up to Sarah
I though I'd say hi

Figured I'd try

I asked her would she like to join me for piece of pizza pie

But she'd rather die die die

Aimed at her face

But thats only a vision and this is reality
I've got all of these people laughing at me how stale of me

I'm so funny and its all accidental again
