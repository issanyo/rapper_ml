"how far will rise
Ringmaster's eyes
Funhouse will rock
Those boys don't lie

Immortal fear
It's voice so clear
Through broken walls
Your screams I hear

Cry little sister
Come, come to your brother
Come change for your sister
Love is with your brother

Clown masquerade rich boys look on
When will they learn
This loneliness?

Temptation's heat
Milenko's work
Deep in your soul
You cannot lie

Cry little sister
Come, come to your brother
Come change for your sister
Love is with your brother

Our shangrila
You can't forget
Always so close
Come to us now

Cry little sister
Come, come to your brother
Come change for your sister
Love is with your brother

Cry little sister
Come, come to your brother
Come change for your sister
Love is with your brother
Cry, little sister
