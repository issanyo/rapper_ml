[Verse 1: Monoxide]
I hear the words are spoken
I think my mind is broken
I keep on steady smokin'
Hopefully I die from chokin'
Know what I was just thinkin'?
Maybe if I keep drinkin'
The voice will quit
And I can escape from this demon deaconn
My life's a living hell
Only the voice can tell
Oh please oh christ compell
Lead me from this evil spell
My body won't stop shakin'
These voices keep on makin'
Me do things to people
This must just be the work of satan

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
They want my mind and soul
This shit is way out of control
I haven't been to sleep in weeks
I'm sweating but my body's cold
I'm shaking like a leaf
Terrified to go to sleep
Puking from the medication
Vitals signs is looking weak
I see him in the mirror
He told me come inside
He lives inside my head
So there's no where to hide
They want my soul to die
So they can come alive
Possess my body
So everyone will realize

[Hook x2: Dark Lotus]
They say they'll give me pain
They say they'll give me love
They say they'll make me bleed
And tell me i'm above
They take me down again
This is my medicine
I cut the head off the devil and I throw it at you!

[Verse 3: Violent J]
I take so many Zoloft
I bleed my nose off
Run up in a church and rip my fucking clothes off
The demon follows me right to the house of God
But then it swallows me and takes me to the Lotus Pod
What can I do when my brains shakes my earth quakes
My lips crack, my skin dries up and flakes
Sleepless, 6 days and peep this
I pin eyelids open, with rusty paperclips

[Verse 4: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
The demons coming for me, they want to take my body
Hands reaching up behind me suffocate the breath upon me
They sqeaze my vocal chords until I want to scream
Call upon the dark lord please wake me from my dream
I'm steady poppin' no-doze, I never want to sleep
Mental pressure over comes the brain, the evil creeps
Body shakes me out of control I need to pop another pill
Demons here to take my soul too late I need a refill

[Interlude: Jamie Madrox]
Spoken are the words
In the hands of pythona
Are the magic spells
To unlock the keys to the universe
It awaits, it will be summoned
By the petals of the Lotus
The night candles clean mind and soul
Shall invoke the power

[Hook x2]

[Verse 5: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I sit alone in the closet so I can hear what they saying
I'm rocking back and forth helpless
Will it, infest my head
My momma told me it would pass its been 17 days
The bag of the Tylenol bottles
Don't say shit about a soul rape
Tell me what the fuck I'm supposed to do now (how)
Act how (now) go where (here) be with who listen more to me or you?
Father tell me whenever will I be back to normal (never)
I guess I'm cursed to live with this headache forever

[Verse 6: Anybody Killa]
I can't sleep at night
Cause all these sounds in the darkness
Wake up in a cold sweat
Body feeling heartless
Pop a couple sleeping pills to try and relax
Every time I doze off something's breathing down my back
Could it be the afterlife or
Just a soul living inside of me
Prayin' for the day to take us both out of our misery
Could it be the evil ways of past on friends?
Or maybe all the lives I took
Are coming back for they revenge

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Give me pain
Give me love
Make me bleed
Take me above
Take me down
This is my medicine
I cut the head of the devil and I throw it at you! x4
