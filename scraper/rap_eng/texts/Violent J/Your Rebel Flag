Stop the bus, Violent J comes out
Barrels to your chest and blow your lungs out
Mother fuck a fuckin hick
I kick ya in the mouth
Sew your fuckin' lips up
You swallow them teeth when I do
And me and my boys'll run a train on your Thelma Lou
Then break her fuckin back
Goddamn bigots ain't all that
So I'mma cut your brain out
Reach in and pull your spine out
Welcome to the Carnival show
Your invited, you and your bitch Flo
And the wicked clowns gonna check
Cut your legs off and and if you crawl back
Don't step to the city folk- bitch that's why you got your titties broke
So get back on your aardvark
Don't let me see a bigot comin' through Clark Park
Cut his neck with my good blade
34 years old, still in the third grade
Yes, pickin' on others--Look at your hootenanny ass mother fucker
And your billy bitch
Hey---Fuck both ya'll ...
And your Rebel flag

CHORUS 1:
Fuck your Rebel flag! (Fuck your Rebel flag)
Fuck your Rebel flag! (Fuck your Rebel flag)-(Fuck your Rebel Flag!)
Fuck your Rebel flag! (Fuck your Rebel flag)
Fuck a Rebel flag! (Fuck your Rebel flag)

Been down south, you can't tell me
Hillbilly hillbilly hillbilly
Uncle Willy acting nilly
Old bitch cooking up vittles
Then fuck on the porch, playing a fiddle
You know I'd love to show you that ghetto style
Take you out back, throw you in a shit pile
Life in the inner city
I'd rip your ass, but you all shitty and funky
Like the pigs you eat
Pickin' that shit off them yellow feet
Don't stop to so much as cough
Or I'mma shoot ya in the back till your chest falls off
What you say ain't always hype
So I slap you in the face with a lead pipe
Teachin kids what pops taught you
And he's a funky ass bigot too
Fell short of the due respect
Don't speak when I slap ya in your red neck
Fuck all that bullshit you stuck on
Get back on your mule and get the fuck on
Don't look back or I'mma hit ya
Take that red neck bitch out with ya
Spit on your Rebel rag, so fuck you and your Rebel flag!

CHORUS 2:
Wilber (I'ma cut his neck)
Hass (I'ma break his back)
Goober (I'ma stab his face)
Jed (I'ma slit his throat)
Wilber (I'ma cut his neck)
Hass (I'ma break his back)
Goober (I'ma stab his face)
Thelma Lou (I'ma fuck her in her ass!)

Hill....
Hillbillies listening down south
Hillbillies listening down south
I'm up and I'm headin for the south
Fixin to put a run of buck shot in your mouth
And blow the back of your fuckin neck loose
Hillbillies run around like a headless goose
Cuz you tried burning down my cross
That's that ready racist hick named Hoss
You sleep in the barn and you fuck your horse
Brick to the head, put you back on course
Yeah----But you know I chill
Cuz if I don't flex on you the others will
Straight folks in the south won't have it
They put a round in your racist ass quick
The cool in the south team up with the north
And blow that bigot off his fucking horse
So put away your goddamn twine
See I'mma cut your pipe and take a little moonshine
Then drink it all up
Barrels to your face and blow your fuckin head off
Keep on gunnin' cuz of what they said
Punk, I'll put a slug in your bald head
Scalp a skinhead quick
And your greasy-ass triple Klan ain't' shit
And zip you up in a bag
And I'll shit on a mother fuckin Rebel flag
Yeah shit on a Rebel flag!!
