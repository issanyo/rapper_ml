[Intro: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Surprise! It's my lucky day
Shucky ducky Iâ€™m fucking lucky
Hand over your chain, your watch, your jacket
Damn you's a player huh partner
Now toss me them keys and beat it bitch

[Verse 1: Violent J]
Iron pipe poke through your head
Make a bong out of it and smoke with the dead
Your homie came for revenge I choked him instead
Your obituary was the joke that I read
I'm a guru master, causer of distaster
Drink all flavors of faygo so fuck shasta
Woo, spell caster, drunken old bastard
Surprise when we trade blows, I throws mine faster

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Motherfucker no surprise, we're the rawest
Making indie money, y'all want any money starvin' artist
You saw my royce parked in the projects
That was just a make you haters hate me more project
I do shit on purpose just to make you haters wanna hurt me
Touch me trip I'll quicker spread like fucking herpes
And we'll drown on your ass, ICP clown on your ass
Da Mafia 6ix ready to ride go to town on that

[Hook: Young Wicked]
9 mili pressed against your forehead
Machete to your neck, wrong move and you're dead (Surprise)
Double barrel placed right to your spine
Empty your pockets which yours is now mine (Surprise)
This could be the end of your life (Decision time)
You shouldn't, shouldn't reach for that knife
You don't know! Just don't be stupid (Surprise)

[Verse 3: Koopsta Knicca]
[?] and now it's me they want dead
Pistol grip, never slip, I'm a grown man
Koopsta god in disguise, can you tell me why
I'mma [?] just to ease your fucking life
Could you see Mafia 6ix and ICP
We beat they ass up like a DJ Paul beat
There he go, quickly reload, down on the floor
Thought I told them niggas that the clique up in this hoe

[Verse 4: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Suddenly it's hard to breath
I just slit your throat from the back, remember me?
Before we dies I wanna look up deep in his eyes
You know what you did to me? Well, surprise!
I coulda just shot you and took off from the spot
But that wasn't enough, I wanna feel your pulse stop
I won't even hide you, leave you in the street like some trash
Butt naked with a wine bottle stickin' out your ass

[Hook]
9 mili pressed against your forehead
Machete to your neck, wrong move and you're dead (Surprise)
Double barrel placed right to your spine
Empty your pockets which yours is now mine (Surprise)
This could be the end of your life (Decision time)
You shouldn't, shouldn't reach for that knife
You don't know! Just don't be stupid (Surprise)

[Verse 5: Young Wicked]
When I came up on em
I'm so sick I'll probably make you vomit
The 5-0 out there looking for me
Cause I gotta murder case and they came to solve it
Surprise a motherfucker with my dangerous content
Everytime I spit it you can tell it's the bomb shit
I'm raining heavy on the haters conscious
Y'all fucked up trying tame the monsters
Y'all better pray to Jesus
Ain't no other rapper in the game could see us
They try but they can't defeat us (Killjoy club)
I'll make everybody bleedin', I know
Y'all ain't ready for me or my hatchet family
Still runnin' beneath the streets

[Verse 6: Crunchy Black]
I can make you move, you can bet that
Hunt the unit on em, is you with that?
See I rob niggas like Kid Cat
I'll make em get back, bitch nigga get back
Hunt the unit on em, robbin' nigga for his ass
Stick and move, I've told you I'm with the shit
Easy come, and easy fucking go ho
I'm looking for that muthafuckin dough bro

[Hook x2]
