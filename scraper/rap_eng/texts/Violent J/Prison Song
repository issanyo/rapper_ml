(Your attention please. As warden Abbiss announced ealier this week
Ionia state penitentiary is now number one in the country among
Inmate education. Thirty-one percent of you have earned your GED
And or diplomas this year alone. As promised we now present to you
In concert, your own fellow inmate Syn. Let's keep it cool and conduct
Ourselves properly boys. Let's show the warden we can do this again
Sometime. Here is Syn.)

I can remember, all that she gave to me
I can remember, how much she hated me
I can remember, just what she kept from me (Bitch!)
And I remember, all that she left to me

I can recall it, when the love was gone
I can recall it, when the pain was strong
I can recall it, when her palm would flash
For what seemed like all night the terror would last

I can remember, the look in my brother's eyes
I can remember, whats left but another try?
I can remember, the heat in the summer time
And I remember, all that was never mine

I can recall it, when the love was gone
I can recall it, when the pain was strong
I can recall it, when her palm would flash
For what seemed like all night the terror would last

I'm not here tryin to make amends
Turn back time and I'd kill her again
It's what I call justifiable sin
Cock the hammer back!
And I put two in

I can remember, half her head was gone
And I remember, it was all over the lawn
Also remember, the cops were everywhere
I can remember, I didn't even care

I can recall it, when the love was gone
I can recall it, when the pain was strong
I can recall it, when her palm would flash
For what seemed like all night the terror would last

I'm not here tryin to make amends
Turn back time and I'd kill her again
It's what I call justifiable sin
Cock the hammer back!
And I put two in
I'm not here tryin to make amends
Turn back time and I'd kill her again
It's what I call justifiable sin
Cock the hammer back!
And I put two in
I'm not here tryin to make amends
Turn back time and I'd kill her again
It's what I call justifiable sin
Cock the hammer back!
And I put two in
