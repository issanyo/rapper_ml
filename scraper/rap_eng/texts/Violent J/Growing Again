[Intro:]
When I grow up, I wanna be a giant...
The biggest muthafucka alive!
That would be the shit!
I wanna be tall, I wanna be big...

[Verse 1:]
{Violent J:}
The jump off - One summer night, I noticed my shoes was fittin' wrong
My feet was all a sudden a half an inch too long
I jumped in my car, and thought
"Now who the fuck was in my seat?"
Fuckin' with my levers and re-adjustin' my mirrors
I stopped to get a Slurpie and I noticed I was floodin' in my jeans
Gettin' back in my car, I split my ass seam
My shit ain't hardly fittin' any more, fucked up detergent, or
I'm growin' bigger than a muthafuckin' dinosaur!
Got out the car and had to duck to get in Shaggy's place
You shoulda seen the fuckin' look up on his painted face he said...

{Shaggy 2 Dope:}
Holy fuckin' shit, I don't know if you knowin'
But you're growin' and it's obviously showin' homie!

[Hook:]
{Shaggy 2 Dope, Violent J:}
Watch where ya fall down (oh shit)
Watch where ya fall down (oh fuck)
Watch where ya fall down (oh shit)
Watch where ya fall down (oh fuck)
Now I'm growin' again, now I'm growin' again (oh shit)
Now I'm growin' again, now I'm growin' again (oh fuck)
[2x]

[Verse 2:]
{Violent J:}
The next day I woke up, Shaggy's three dogs were trippin' on me
Layed out on his couch, a smooth nine foot three
They don't fuckin' love me no more, I stand up
And put a hole in Shaggy's ceilin' with my big ass nug
The dogs ran, Shaggy's like...

{Shaggy 2 Dope:}
Holy fuck, don't move!
First thing you gotta fuckin' do is do not move!
We need to get you out the house before you fuck my shit up

{Violent J:}
I had to crawl through the hall into the front yard, then get up
I'm lookin' through the eyes of a 12 foot tall man
Don't feel any different, though I could use a tall can
I'm growin' every hour and the reason's unknown
Now I'm sittin' on your home with my feet on your lawn
Damn...

[Hook:]
[2x]

[Verse 3:]
{Violent J:}
To me SUV s and Sedans, they're like pop cans
A little bit heavier but tin in my hands
Shaggy's chillin' on my shoulder in a custom made basket

{Shaggy 2 Dope:}
I'm tryin' to ride wit' my boy in this bitch and outlast it!

{Violent J:}
I try to stay in one place, it ain't no use in hidin'
Hella choppers beamin' wit' coppers on all sides
And the media governments are offerin' jobs
(He's a freak of nature!)
World press, scientists, all swarmin' wit' this mob
(He's huge!)
All around us...
(Incredible!)

{Shaggy 2 Dope:}
Fuck it J, you only gettin' bigger dog
You and me, right now, homie go for a jog
We've been sittin' here, lettin' them observe us and for what?
I say you tell 'em "Fuck the world!" and throw the lotus up!

{Violent J:}
Now I'm runnin', every step is 32 miles
Shakin' the earth, turnin' buildings into piles
And I'm runnin', crushin' trees like blades of grass
My head's above the clouds, all they see is my ass
And I'm runnin', 600 mile an hour wind gust
Footsteps, explosions, three days of dust
And I'm runnin', and I can still hear Shaggy on the megaphone

{Shaggy 2 Dope:}
"Keep, keep, keepin' on, don't stop, come on!"

{Violent J:}
And I'm runnin' through states in two steps or less
Through the oceans and don't even be gettin' my nuts wet
And I'm runnin', finally gravity took me away
I ran right off the planet into the black of outer space
And I'm runnin'...
