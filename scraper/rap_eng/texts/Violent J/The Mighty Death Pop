[Verse 1: Violent J]
Party
It's what you choose
Wild and wicked, you abuse
Well fuck it
No need to heed
The hell with caution increase the speed

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
You push it
Impress the rest
Run up and tell you ain't 'bout the dress
You crazy
Don't care about nothin'
We'll see when that coffin's shuttin'

[Hook: Insane Clown Posse]
With the mighty death pop
[POP!]
Everything stops
You either rise or drop
(Livin on the wild side
Just hope it's a long ride)
With the mighty death pop
[POP!]
Everything stops
You either rise or drop
(You keep prayin he will come
When it all shuts off, you done)

[Verse 3: Insane Clown Posse]
Rock on
Drop that confetti
The death pop's when you ain't ready
Hey, big shot, hope you don't get shot
He comes when provoked (the death pop)
Let your balls hang out if you wanna
But don't cry when they get kicked (get kicked)
The black out's sudden end to your party
The mighty death pop happens quick
Every day throw it up, celebrate life
Cause that shit could pop tonight
Make noise
If he hears about you
Suddenly we're without you

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Insane Clown Posse]
You crazy ass fool
You need to stop
So what, you on top
(THE MIGHTY DEATH POP)
Yeah, and he comes by request
Live life a train wreck
And you're next
If you want the trouble
He'll pop your bubble
And then drop you
On the double
He'll eject yo' ass if the beat is skippin'
'Cause you stuck in the fast lane, trippin'
You a balloon livin' in a picker bush
Believe it your buzzer
It's gettin pushed
He loves the risky rock n roll
Who gives a fuck, so outta control

[Hook]
