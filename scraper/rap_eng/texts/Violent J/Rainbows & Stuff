[Violent J]
This goes out to that special someone in my life
Oh we all have somebody special, this is for them

I like ice cream, cherry pie
And lemonade with summer freeze
I like rainbows, leafy trails
And puppy dogs and bumblebees
I like cotton candy gum
And bumper cars at carnivals
Golden skies and hazel eyes
And sand in-between my toes...but

(Chorus)
SOMETHIN' TELLS ME THAT I HATE YOU!
SOMETHIN' TELLS ME I MUST KILL YOU!

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
YOU AIN'T SHIT BUT A SLUTY ASS MOTHERFUCKING SLUT YOU FUCKING WHORE!
I FUCKING HATE YOU!

[Violent J]
I like birthday candle cakes
And titty shakes with silicone
Secret whispers and D-Loc Sisters
And apple dips, gingerbread homes
Faking chills, they give me thrills
And Nyquil pills, they make me sleep
Hershey Kisses and happinesses
Something so blessin' yet all the while

(Chorus)

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
SUCK MY FUCKING DICK, FUCK OFF
GO FUCK YOURSELF YOU PUNK ASS LITTLE BIOTCH!
I'LL, I'LL, I'LL FUCKING PINCH YOUR NIPPLES SHUT

[Violent J]
I like Shaggy, he's my friend
I like his mom 'cause she's nice to me

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Thank you J, I like you too

[Violent J]
Oh well, it's okay, we're family
Raver chicks and kung-fu flicks
And sugar sticks like lollipop (popping sound)
All these things happiness brings
But my hatred for you don't stop...bitch

(Chorus 2x)

[*Shaggy yelling*]
BIAAAATCHHHHH, I FUCKING HATE YOUUUUU
I FUCKING KILL YOUUUUUU, YOU SCARY BIIIIITCH...
