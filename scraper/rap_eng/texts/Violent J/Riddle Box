(In background of hook and bridge)
Come on down, turn the crank
And see where your soul will spend the rest of eternity
What's it gonna be, mister?
Heaven or hell?
The bonus or the bone
Turn the crank and let's find out
Come on down, mister
You don't have anything to be scared of, do you sir?
So what's gonna pop out of the mighty Riddle Box?
Spin the crank and let's find out!
What do you say?
Step right up, who's first?
Who's brave enough to step into their new eternal destiny?
Surely someone must be confident
That their life wasn't totally evil
Step right up and seal your fate!
