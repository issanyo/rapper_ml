I remember beatin down the block was the thing to do
In my fisherman hat with the kangaroo
Everybody rap, thought they hood was Compton
And the wolves yelled (oww) with 6 x 9's rockin

[Shaggy]
I remember the Doors, I remember Live-Aid
And I remember every year Jerry Lewis got paid
I remember shit live back when nobody missed it
Like Mike first doin the moonwalk and spinnin

[Violent J]
I remember the hippies smokin grass and fuckin
Disco dancin floor lights I'm cuttin
I remember Beatlemania sweepin the planet
All that screamin from hoes, I couldn't stand it

[Shaggy]
I remember Bruce Lee, PS3 to Pong
Spandex, hair metal, rock love songs
But everything's came and gone somehow
I only ask you, what the fuck is happenin now?

[Hook 2X]
Nothin, let me know
Sure feel like nothin, let me know what
Might be somethin there (what's good)
I'm feelin nothin, let me know what's good

[Violent J]
I remember when the twist was the thing to do
Slap grease on your head and hoes hang with you
I remember punk rock when it wasn't for sale
And death metal scarin people straight to hell

[Shaggy]
So many different cliques and crews to belong to
All identified by the music they drawn to
Check the status of your apparatus and then go
Nowaday, it ain't that clear though

[Violent J]
I remember when jazz was born in New Orleans
Mom-and-pop record stores, I'd explore these
I remember when you handed in a newer 8-track
You got three old ones back, dope

[Shaggy]
I was at the first Woodstock, backstage
I smoked a joint and dropped acid with Jimmy Page
I can't believe it's all over somehow
I only ask you, what the fuck is happenin now?

[Hook 2X]
Nothin, let me know
Sure feel like nothin, let me know what
Might be somethin there (what's good)
I'm feelin nothin, let me know what's good

[Violent J]
I only ask you, what the fuck is happenin now?

[Shaggy]
I remember Led Zeppelin laid Stairway to Heaven
I delivered a pizza to they studio session
I was there when Beethoven went deaf and blind
He just kept playin like he ain't even mind it

[Violent J]
I sold pills to Elvis, he let me backstage
I stole his guitar, later sold it on eBay
I cannot believe it's all over somehow
I only ask you, what the fuck is happenin now?

[Hook 2X]
Nothin, let me know
Sure feel like nothin, let me know what
Might be somethin there (what's good)
I'm feelin nothin, let me know what's good

I only ask you, what the fuck is happenin now?
