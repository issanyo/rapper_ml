[Hook x2]
Sleep is like a curse
Yeah I'm drippin' and I'm stranded on a dream
Please don't leave me, I'm shrouded in the clouds
On my nightmare, someone let me out
I don't wanna die here

[Verse 1: Violent J]
I begin my walk on a downward slope
The sand is red, so hot it's hard to cope
There's six suns above me, sweltering
Millions of beetles fly, pelting me
I'm not alone, there's others bounded to dead trees
They have no mouths but their eyes, they cry "please"
I stay in my path as it leads me to a cave
Thank God, or he will bring me to my grave
To the mouth of the big red mountain
The first thing I see is a giant, blood fountain
As the plasma flows I see a dog drinking from it
The smell of death in the air makes me wanna vomit
But I don't... I maintain to move ahead
There's three ways to go and two will leave me dead
I'm on a trail in the middle and all I'm knowin'
Is this tunnel is getting smaller or I'm growin?

Sleep is like a curse
Yeah I'm drippin' and I'm stranded on a dream
Please don't leave me, I'm shrouded in the clouds

I don't wanna die here

[Verse 2: Violent J]
I've come to an opening and sit to rest
I know there's sight of leeches on my arms and chest
I pull 'em off, look up and see a boy
He tosses me a ball, I throw him back his toy
He waves "come on!" and I think about it
And reach yes, he turns around and starts walking
I'm speechless, the back of his head is blown off
Like a shotgun (bonk) and I'm like "what the fuck!?"
I stick with him anyways as brains are falling out
I wanna help the kid, I keep calling out
And come to a giant pit, it looks bottomless
I'm right behind him like how we're getting out of this?
He turns around facing me and like he's heartless
He flips me off and falls back into the darkness
And silently plummets, I back track some like
Why was I following him anyway, I'm that dumb?

[Verse 3: Violent J]
I finally found a way out, it's night time
I can see the galaxy just looking at the skyline
There's fireflies buzzing big as baseballs
Serpents, snails and everything that crawls
I can see a tree in the pale light of the moons' glow
The closer I get the more I make up to show
Bodies, hanging by the neck - maybe twenty of them
All with no arms or legs, man, so many of them
Way up at the top, all over the bottom
Plenty enough for who must have felled just rotten
Probably's got a name but I rather not know it
Did people put the bodies there or did the tree grow 'em?
Four moons in the sky sheet with wings
I can see them walking on the planet sprains
Where the fuck am I? I'm lost in my brain
I'm being eaten by a snake when I'm hearing my name

[Interlude]
Girl: Joe wake up, wake up, you're having a nightmare
Jeez, are you ok? God, don't sleep

[Hook x4]
Sleep is like a curse
Yeah I'm drippin' and I'm stranded on a dream
Please don't leave me, I'm shrouded in the clouds
On my nightmare, someone let me out
