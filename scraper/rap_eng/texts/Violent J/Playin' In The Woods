Ooh
I like playing in the woods at night
All alone in the dark - I don't need a flashlight
If it's warm out - I get naked
Except for my shoes - My feet can't take it
June-bugs, bees and mosquitoes
Snatch them out of the air with my tongue
And eat those
I love a full moon let it glow mm-mm
Illuminate, shadows grow and loom there
Ooh yeah, lay here in the leaves
Earth come crawl over me please
Snails ,fleas ,snakes and centipedes
Many friends in need - I let them enter me
My secret life in the woods is crazy
The sun comes up too soon and chase me away
But I'll be back, alone
To kick it with the crickets
Right at home

[Hook]
I like playing in the woods at night
(No campfire)
Just me and the moonlight

I like playing in the woods at night
Coyotes, crows and cowwebs

I like playing in the woods at night
(No campfire)
Just me and the moonlight

I like playing in the woods at night

Ooh, everything seems to begin closing in
What the fuck was that ? There it goes again
I don't wanna run - I wanna be a friend
And bond with the otherside, let me in
Show me how to fry, kill, fight
Be one with the night, not to punk and fright
To be alone in the dark for miles takes heart
But am i really alone ? That's the best part
I lay there - they take little bites
And it hurts, but i don't move
Show them that's its alright
It hurts more when bigger shit shows up
They tear chunks off me, but i ain't no softy
I'm Haaard!
I do whatever I please
Play dead for hours - buried in the leaves
My midnight playground, my private park
To run to alone naked child of the dark
I'm saying

[Hook]

Caterpillars cling to the tree trunks
Salamanders, snakes and skunks
Blood bats - they don't need eyes
To snag off anything that flies
I live a wild life
So why can't I be wildlife ? With a hunting knife
My feet sink deep in the mood
After it rain - I can't complain
No exhaust, no noise pollution
No retribution of evolution
If it ain't nature - I fucking hate ya'
Kill or be killed - Till something ate ya;
Twigs ,bushes, muddy den
Chipmunk in my mouth, bloody chin
The moooon follows me because it loves me
The one does nature does me

[Hook]

I like playing in the woods at night
