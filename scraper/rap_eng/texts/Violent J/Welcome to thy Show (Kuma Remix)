Violent j and shaggy 2 Dope:
Well hello boy and girls come on in see the show
It's the mystical, magical, great dark carnival
Don't bother looking for parking
It ain't like you ever comin back you fucking idiot
The carnival emerges only when you about to die
And right now motherfucker, you about dead in the sky
So come and put your soul up on the murder-go-round
And we'll strap you down and send you into oblivion
I got a spike for your neck with my ninja blowgun, because I be the
Juggalada Don Dada Lada shogun
I swings my sword down and split you and two, before you even fall
I Bitch smack both of you
Welcome to the Carnival 50,000 Juggalos, freaks and weirdos
And killers at our shows. I'm just glad we down with em
Hate to be y'all, and havea juggalo shatter my skull, for the Carnival

(Chorus)
Welcome to the show, Shangri-la of the Dark Carnival. because bitch boy you dead
Welcome to the show, Shangri-la of the Dark Carnival. Because you dead dead dead dead
And fuck you if you don't like it

Shaggy 2 Dope and violent J:
Welcome to my exhibit, I be the Shaggs, sit back and enjoy
Relax your nipples and nutbags. It's only Juggalos here;
You know what we about:swingin hatchets, Faygo
And our dick in your mouth. So they call us a circus we accept the roll
We been sayin that its comin for like 10 years or so
And everywhere that we from Alaska to Spain we seein Juggalos dancin
In th Faygo rain. Some of those at our shows feel a carnival high
I seen them jump from the stage and float off into the sky
They ain't never comin back, their Carnival has been found
And all we can do is dream about it smokin em down
I got love for people and I hope to die
I got Neden waitin on me up in Shangri-la
But if you really wanna hear the fuckin devils exhibit, the shit
Is called Hells PIT run out and get it

(Chorus)
The ringleader: Ugh! Bitch! The Juggalos said...

Juggalo Chant:
When its your time, death is near, step right on over here, Games , prizes, shows, and rides- its that carnival paradise 
(Repeat)
Welcome to the show, Shangri-la of the Dark Carnival
Welcome to the show, its that Carnival paradise
(repeat)

The Ring Leader: And fuck the fuck outta you if you don't like it
