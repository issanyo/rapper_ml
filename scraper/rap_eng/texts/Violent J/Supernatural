Motherfucker, I can speak to crows
I see through their eyes
I can hear the truth behind the wickedest lies
I can snap my fingers and make fire appear
I see visions of the future through a crack in the mirror
I'm supernatural, I turn water to ice
With my bare hands, I don't need a freezer device
I can bend the spoon, tie it up in a knot, without touching it once
(True powers I got)
I can spit hot acid, I can see in the dark
Because I'm supernatural, and I'm living my part
I can levitate cards but I'm not a magician
'Cause my magic is official while these others are wishin'
I can read your palm, I got the telekinesis
Concentrate on a piece of fruit and blow it to pieces
I can see through walls and guess the color you're wearin'
Before you walk in the room
(My super psyche is flarin')
I can close my eyes and read the page of a book
I can tell you where your keys are and don't have to look
I'm supernatural, it's in the beat of my heart
The only bone that comes with it is the hard part

[Chorus]
I can feel the pain of the dead
The angry dead
The lost and alone, I feel 'em bang in my head
They yell for someone else but I can hear 'em instead
I can hear 'em instead, I can hear 'em instead
I feel the pain of the dead
The lost and alone, I feel 'em bang in my head
They yell for someone else but I can hear 'em instead
I can hear 'em instead, I can hear 'em instead

Supernatural without the hat tricks
Sometimes I find 'em floatin' just above my mattress
I don't have to hit the switch to cut the lights on
I don't have to say check (to know my mic's on)
I got the ESP extraordinarily
So much my momma used to say 'OK, you're scarin' me'
I can tell you what hand you got the ball in
Without the ID I can always tell who's callin'
I can melt a candle down just by starin' at it
If I keep glarin' at it, steady wearin' at it
The wind blows everytime I walk outside
Dogs don't bark, they howl
(Most cats hide)
'Cause I'm supernatural like a vampire
See me hold out my hand and withstand fire
I can turn it all on or off as I go
The only part I can't control

[Chorus]
Is when I feel the pain of the dead
The angry dead
The lost and alone, I feel 'em bang in my head
They yell for someone else but I can hear 'em instead
I can hear 'em instead, I can hear 'em instead
I feel the pain of the dead
The lost and alone, I feel 'em bang in my head
They yell for someone else but I can hear 'em instead
I can hear 'em instead, I can hear 'em instead
