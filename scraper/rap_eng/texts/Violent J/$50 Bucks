(Violent J and [Shaggy 2 Dope])
[Hey yo J]
What's up player?
[You know they don't like Juggalos over there]
Right
[$50 bucks says you don't get nothin']
Man, let me tell you somethin'

(Violent J)
Check this out (What up?)
It might sound shady
But I fuck a rich hoe named Grady
They call her that cause her hair is blue
She's one of them rebellious rock chicks too
Anyway she has a big hoop in her neden
Rings, chains, needles, pins, and things
Tattoos, it might sound fierce
But I swear to God the bitch gots her butthole pierced
She told me she liked it rough
I'm like straight
First thing she did was punch me in the face (Pow!)
I'm about to plant one to her jaw
Before I could she was tonguin' my balls
Oooooh whadablah I dropped my weapon
Looked down and my nuts was kicksteppin'
We was butt naked all over the floor
It felt weird though cause we was at the Faygo store

(Chorus)
Momma don't like this wicked clown
I might come from the dark side of town
When she's gone and you're alone again
50 bucks says you'll let me in

(Violent J and [Shaggy 2 Dope])
Hey yo Shaggy
[What up playa?]
You know they don't like juggalos over there
[Right]
50 bucks says you don't get nothing
[Man, let me tell you somethin']

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
I've done fuck bitches both sides of the border
Nuthin' like Greta the millionaire's daughter
Something like 950 sumthin' pounds
5'8" tall and she love clowns
Bitch had titties like water balloons
My boys used to swing off 'em like baboons
She'd buy us chocolate Swiss cheese pie
And take it, and bake it completely naked
An ocean of loopness it ain't like nuthin'
Just jump anywhere in the mess and start humpin'
Don't really matter where I stick my dick
I just reach, and grab, and stab, and jab
But that ain't the reason that I love this hoe
She used to do a funny little trick with my dick hole
She'd blow into it and make a wish
And my nuts would expand like puffer fish

(Chorus)
Momma don't like this wicked clown
I might come from the dark side of town
When she's gone and you're alone again
50 bucks says you'll let me in
(Repeat)
