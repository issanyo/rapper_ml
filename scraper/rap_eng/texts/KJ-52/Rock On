Chorus:
Are y'all ready for this (Rock on)
Pump ya fist to this (Rock on)
Never mess with this (Rock on)

So come and get with this (Rock on) (Repeat Chorus)
1 2 3 and to the 4
Well, this is what happens when hip-hop meets the hardcore
From the stands all the way to the dance floor
Get ya hands up pump it till ya arm sore
Ya better understand now who we rock for
The Son of Man just nothing else nothing more
So make your plans any time that we on tour
It's guaranteed we can and will give ya what ya came for
What's the deal what in the world ya standing there for
C'mon for real I came in here to declare war
I ain't ashamed of the name of who I stand for
Jesus reigns supreme I'll say it till my tongue sore

Party people you want to get down
Are ya ready to rock and get down
Show me what ya got then get down

So everybody in the spot get down now (Chorus)
It goes 1 2 3 and to the 4
We ain't down get ready cuz there's plenty more
Ya better come get this life that we living for
So my man gives these people what they waiting for
Rock, rock, ready to roll
It's also no celebrating out of control
C'mon party people and hit the dance floor
Keep the party rocking till your hands get sore
It sounds too much to ignore
So throw your hands up yo give me some more
We're party on poor let the crowd roar
Cuz me and God are here to settle the score
C'mon

Party people you want to get down
Are ya ready to rock and get down
Show me what ya got then get down

So everybody in the spot get down now (Chorus x 3)
