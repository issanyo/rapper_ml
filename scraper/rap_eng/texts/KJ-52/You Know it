Verse 1
Yo
It's like a got a fountain of youth
It's like a got a fountain of truth
So I'm a write em down in the booth
I got these lines in my mouth like a rap was a crack in my tooth

See I was down for a few
Down for the count, but I'm back on the move
(hmmm)
And I don't know what to do
But the boy came up like a bouncing ballon
(wooh)
I ain't even down witcha crew
I ain't even down witcha rules
I am just down with The Truth
I am just down with the proof
That my Lord ran out of the tomb
Boom!
Stick and bounce on the groove
Lookin' for an up and down on the move
Plus a got a mountain to move
So, chew on that like a mouth full of food
(come on)

Chorus:
But I'm to old to be feeling this young
So why quite now when I just begun
I prayed my whole life for this moment
You know, you know, you know it!

Man is you feeling alright?
You know, you know, you know it!
Plus, is it still about Christ?
You know, you know, you know it!
(D.j) Managing your life?
You know, you know, you know it!
Tell 'em what it is been like
You know, you know, you know it!


Verse 2
22 years in the game, 22 years and it came
But I am not fearing the fame
I am not hearing you man
Plus I'm not fearing the change
You think I'm weird in the brain?
You think I'm weird, I'm a lame
You think I'm weird and I'm strange
But I never blend in like a tear in the rain

13 with a necklace
Tryin' to get the cream and Beem and a jeep and a Lexus
And I was so reckless
Runnin' down the dream
But I'd never ever seen it posses
Then I heard a message
About a God that could turn it all around, the direction
And then a learn a lesson
That everyday, only thing that I count is a blessing

Chorus:
But I'm to old to be feeling this young
So why quite now when I just begun
I prayed my whole life for this moment
You know, you know, you know it!

Man is you feeling alright?
You know, you know, you know it!
Plus, is it still about Christ?
You know, you know, you know it!
(D.j) Managing your life?
You know, you know, you know it!
Tell 'em what it is been like
You know, you know, you know it!

Bridge:
God good. Devil Bad
All I had was a pen and pad
All I got is the breath I have
Take this life and then give it back
I'm like...

Chorus:
But I'm to old to be feeling this young
So why quite now when I just begun
I prayed my whole life for this moment
You know, you know, you know it!
