[Hook: KJ-52]
All I had was Jesus and the family
All I had was Jesus and the family
All I had was Jesus and the family
All I had was Jesus and the family

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
Yeah, Uh, Said I had a had a wrong religion
Then they said I made a wrong decision
I can't just fall still I'm on a mission
Still I stand behind the bars, kinda like a God of prison
I got a vision I listen
My Savior gone and risen
My God is still up on the throne when you wanna diss Him
The old me is dead and gone I ain't gon' miss him
My goal had to subtract just like it's long division
They still think I'm kinda odd
Part-time rapper, I'm a full time Man of God
You see the Rock that I'm standing on
All you ever see is the green likes it's camouflage
I got a team and we standin' strong
Still I stand behind the bars, Kinda like a God of Prison
But through it all I don't plan to fall
Plus He got my every move like the dude in Avatar

[Chorus: KJ-52]
All I had was Jesus and the family
All I had was Jesus and the family
All I had was Jesus and the family
I ain't understand me
I ain't had plan b
All I had was Jesus and the family
All I had was Jesus and the family
All I had was Jesus and the family
I ain't got a plan b

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
They say that God is into details
I say God has taken three nails
Painted up all on the cross with a crevial
Will the devil have me locked, nah but he fail
What you see here, I'm just an eye witness
So I run it back to him like the line of scrimmage
You can't tell me now that I finish
But you miss the bars kinda like a blind gymnast
Blind gymnast man you can't see
I rock it tighter than your pants be
So If I'm silent and I can't speak
God be speaking all up in my ears like a hands-free
You can slam me, bam me, All I ever got was this
Never had a plan b
I got no limits to his plans, B
All I ever had was Jesus and the family

[Verse 3: Datin]
Hold up
God in this life is my squad on the mic
That I use to speak into the darkness when I call Him the Light
I got the Holy Spirit, My Heavenly Father, and Christ that I serve with all of my might
And I follow this right
And persecution is promised
They this calling is the fight
But in my past I wasn't scared of a brawl or a fight
Why would that change
Especially now that God has been right there beside me fighting my battles
Demons fall at the sight of my King
He stands taller than Godzilla stands so I'm safe
I feel like Anne in King Kong's gorilla hands
Who lied to Satan and told him that there's is still a chance
It is written only the army of God will advance
A plan b would be just man-made
So I'm betting on plan a
You know I can't sway
In the face I def. worship with my hands raised
I would give it all for Jesus and my family

[Chorus: KJ-52]
All I had was Jesus and the family
All I had was Jesus and the family
All I had was Jesus and the family
I ain't understand me
I ain't had a plan b
All I had was Jesus and the family
All I had was Jesus and the family
All I had was Jesus and the family
I ain't got a plan b

[Chorus: KJ-52]
All I had was Jesus and the family
All I had was Jesus and the family
All I had was Jesus and the family
I ain't understand me
I ain't had a plan b
All I had was Jesus and the family
All I had was Jesus and the family
All I had was Jesus and the family
I ain't got a plan b
