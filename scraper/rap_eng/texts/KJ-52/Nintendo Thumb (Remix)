[Heath]
Yo, KJ

[KJ]
Yup?

[Heath]
Take your shirt off

[KJ]
Okay

[Verse 1: Heath McNease]
(C'mon)
N-I-N-T-E-N-D-O
Lock the doors, bar the windows
I'm thinking 'bout one thing this week though
Mario Bros. 1 through 3
And Tetris and Metroid, I destroyed
I'm the best boy, bring it in your chest boy
Next up, Legend of Zelda
Then hit it up with a little bit of Double Dribble
2 points, 3 points, 2 buttons
Don't touch it, I'm rough with this
Switch from B to A to A to B
With the speed, don't play with me
Digits are blistered again
Soak them in vinegar and liniment, then begin again
Sensei of Ninja Gaiden, I've been playing it since ten
Kung Fu guru, 8-bit Mega Man
Malevolent manic competitor
I'm a veteran at it
If you know better than that then sit down, go practice
"That was the baddest!"
Thanks Mom, aren't you glad to know
That your son's the bomb at something
It's better than nothing
At least it ain't dragons & dungeons

[Hook] x2
I've got Nintendo thumb
Dang, dawg, my thumb's so numb
This controller is controlling me
It makes me feel so dumb
Why don't you come get some?
I know that you don't want none
If you did, you'd get it cause I'd give it to you
Sit down, son

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
Got my Nintendo Thumb (yup)
I got my Power Glove (okay)
I'll BMX rollin' up, homie show me love
Show my homies up, I'll blow my homies up
I got it straight made, eighth grade they growin' up
Man, I'm straight paid, Grape Aid up in my cup
Now what you lames say? Watch me go an' show you up
Nintendo gangsta watch me buck-buck Duck Hunt
Mike Tyson, punchin', jabbin', hookin', the uppercut (ow)
Now wassup wassup
Ain't hearin' what you say (nah)
Door shut stuck inside, tv all day (day)
What you punks say? You think we gon' play?
Chump its left, right, up, down, A, B, B, A
What you gon' say? (nothin')
You could never touch me (nothin')
You gettin' blown out like a cartridge that's dusty
Man, it's gettin' ugly
My homies 'bout to fight
All because my game tight
Man, it's on tonight

[Hook] x2
I've got Nintendo thumb
Dang, dawg, my thumb's so numb
This controller is controlling me
It makes me feel so dumb
Why don't you come get some?
I know that you don't want none
If you did, you'd get it cause I'd give it to you
Sit down, son

[Verse 3: Heath McNease]
I mastered the 8-bit masterpiece
When I was a little kid I was bound to be
A digital athlete, it came naturally, I didn't ask to be
Gifted when I'm kicking it with Kid Icarus, I'm victorious
Or I won't play at all, I won't take a loss
I won't push pause, I'll turn the game off
RBI or Tecmo Bowl or Bases Loaded, it's game over
Never gonna be intimidated, innovative is my middle name
A legitimate claim
I'm bringing the pain, call me Top Gun
I hunt ducks with a shotgun
Not a pistol, you're pitiful, I'm Robocop, that's literal
Girlies whistle cause I'm a fit as a fiddle, nerdy and burly
And surely they don't deserve me
If they can't come in first place
On Excitebike, I'm the type of guy who can
Cover my eye and beat you by
A couple of miles
You struggling while I'm chuckling loud
Can't you see, you ain't got a chance with me
I'm a pro, you're amateur see
Mark my words, thinking you can handle me
It'll be your Final Fantasy

[Hook] x2
I've got Nintendo thumb
Dang, dawg, my thumb's so numb
This controller is controlling me
It makes me feel so dumb
Why don't you come get some?
I know that you don't want none
If you did, you'd get it cause I'd give it to you
Sit down, son

[Bridge: Heath McNease]
Contra, Castlevania, DuckTales, WrestleMania
California Games, Shinobi
Get a Power Pad, you still can't hold me
Who's dumber than this?
Whose thumb's number than this?
Who's the next chump on the list?
They'll get the beating of a lifetime
One that they're not gonna forget

[Outro: Heath McNease]
Get your thumbs up!
Get your thumbs up!
Get your thumbs up!
Get your thumbs up!
Get your thumbs up!
Get your thumbs up!
Get your thumbs up!
Get your thumbs up!
(ahh yeah)
