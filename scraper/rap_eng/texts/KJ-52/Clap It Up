[Verse 1 KJ-52]
Heres a few rhyme schemes for the rhyme fiends
I die daily so the flesh is a crime scene
He won’t fail me I’m blessed now that I  seen
More eyes get open  than 30 bottles of the visine
Yeah I flow dirty but I rhyme clean
Plus I look thirty but move like I’m 19
Pick up the mic to proclaim it about my king
I’m same dude same crew since the nine three
You on the internet taking shots at my team
Log off take the plank out ya eyebeam
You can’t seen man ya lost in the high beams
Plus your theology’s probably worse than ya hygiene
Why me I'm a crime fiend
Yet you saved me you provide for my dreams
Man its crazy you provide for my peace
I'm amazed where I came from since I'm free

[Chorus]
If your living for the King gone clap it up
If your life is truly free gone clap it up
If you know who we be gone clap it up
Gone clap it up we gone clap it up it’s time to clap it up

Selah:
I be spitting them life bars, so witty
We fam I feel at home in yo city
The pearly gates await so if death comes
Its like p-diddy present day its no biggie
I know you feel the same way
Send a man to know God my one wish no ray j
I’m a trip no vacay its friday no day day
Somebody radio mayday KJ I jk look
I just tell them about the risen life
I found color in the light prism life
And ex-cons never walk up in the studio
Cuz they always saying the bars kind of like prison life
Time now clock on the wrist-zay
To be the illest at my job no sick day
All day Yahweh we boom bap it up
Yeah we about to wrap it up click click clap it up

[Verse 2 Goldinchild]
Yeah I spit for the truth so hold your applause fam
Fortune and fame and why I follow God, man
And honestly I don’t know if I got fans
Cause Christ is the way and he teach me how to walk fam
Banging beats ever since i had a walkman
Headphones bumping that sound of the God-man
The one who’s light shines bright in the darkness
Freeing those souls from the system that were lost in
Controlled by the hands of the powers that be
And i refuse to let the beast start devouring me
Yeah I’m not just a barcode in your numbering scheme
Keep my hands to the skies eyes fixed on Elohim
The blood of Christ be reside in me
It's like a beacon of light that stays guiding me
Remove the scales from my eyes so that I can see
That his voice is the truth I can hear it when he speaks..
