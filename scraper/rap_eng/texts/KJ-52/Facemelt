I thought I had it all together but
You took my situation changed it up
And that's the best thing that you ever done
And I was colder then December sun
But now I'm looking at the sin I done
You was the one that I was running from
Every piece of me that had come undone
Facemelt that's how I sum it up

Woah oh woah oh come on
I think you got me with a facemelt
I think you rocked me with a facemelt
Woah oh woah oh come on
I think you got me with a facemelt
You went and shocked me with a facemelt

I'm getting rid of all my other junk
Cause all it ever did was leave me stuck
You found me out just when I was on the run
I am the reason why you shed your blood
And yo you was never letting up
I might might fall but then you get me up
And its all just cause of what you done
Facemelt I think I said enough
