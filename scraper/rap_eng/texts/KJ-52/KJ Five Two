[Verse 1]
Brown hair eyes of blue
200 lbs. clocking in at six foot two
You can catch me watching Veggie Tales sipping Mountain Dew
Spending too much money at the mall and Gadzooks
Now I'm rolling through McDonald's I'm getting a number two
But I know they gonna act rude and mess up my food
"Here's your cheeseburger and plus your coke too"
Ha ha thanks a lot but where's my fries at fool?
I tried to grow a mullet way back in high school
I was like "Now everybody gonna think that I'm cool"
And the girls are gonna say "You're cuter than Tom Cruise"
But instead they laugh at me like the Sponge Bob dude
Looking back I don't know just how I made it through
But you live and learn, that just what you go through
Cause nowadays kids be like "KJ rocks dude"
My name is KJ...everybody stay tuned

[Hook]
My name is KJ AKA KJ five two
My name is KJ it is so nice to meet you
My name is KJ AKA KJ five two
My name is KJ it is so nice to meet you
My name is KJ... five two

[Verse 2]
Now ya'll be messing up my name
It's not fifty two it don't stand for King James
I waited too long now so let me explain
John 6:9 let me break it down plain
Five loaves two fishes is what the boy gave
So I took what I had and I just did the same
Put it all in his hands and I just walked away
I said Lord it's all yours you can have the whole thing
I know what I bring it might sound a little strange
But I'm not in it just for this money or the fame
Feel just the same ain't nothing ever changed
I still drive a mini van and nah I ain't ashamed
Sipping Lipton Iced Tea dipping switching lanes
Like an insane soccer mom about to hit the game
Yelling at the lame drivers saying "Get out of the way"
My name is KJ y'all know the name

[Hook]
My name is KJ AKA KJ five two
My name is KJ it is so nice to meet you
My name is KJ AKA KJ five two
My name is KJ it is so nice to meet you
My name is KJ... five two
