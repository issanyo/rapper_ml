Oh no he's back again
What ya know here I go and I'm rapping and
In the studio in the lab again
One mic, one flow, one pad and pen
For one mo' just stack em in
One show let's roll lets pack em in
Ya'll know when we coming in
We blow every mind when we telling them
And chose every rhyme that we sending them
So folks recognize to be born again and realize he died so you can live again
And he'll crack the sky and he'll come again
All right let's ride start bouncing then
We can go all night it don't have to end
Hey Todd we started man
So get em high holla back if ya hear me then

Here we go like whoop whoop...

And ya feel it bump and ya loving that
Then get em up turn it up and just bump the track
Cause that's the way that we running that
All day every day we gotta come with that
All truth no lies just none of that
Just for you every time just a ton of that
All truth no lies just none of that

And just every time i'll be running that
And so that's why i'm always bumping that
So getta fist real high and start pumping that
