Wait up, hold up, it's over
(I'm washed up y'all)
Wait up, hold up, it's over
(It's all over now y'all)

Wait up, hold up, it's over
(I'm giving up y'all)
Wait up, hold up, it's over
('Cuz I'm washed up y'all)

Won't you look at me now
VH1 got me on the countdown
A phone call is how I found out
I'm on TV y'all, who's the man now?

Alright y'all, check this
Ya boy KJ, number 26
But I just got gypped
I should be in the top 10
Ahead of Will Smith

Thanks for that list
Dear Slim is such a dis
I mean praying for him, it's obvious
I mean that's not hip hop, right?

I guess I could rap on, shooting and killing
Looting, stealing, villains, drug dealing
And I could sell 10 million
I mean forget about doing something for the children, right?

Wait up, hold up, it's over
(I'm washed up y'all)
Wait up, hold up, it's over
(It's all over now y'all)

Wait up, hold up, it's over
(I'm giving up y'all)
Wait up, hold up, it's over
('Cuz I'm washed up y'all)

They called me KJ-52
And I rap about Jesus, it's a bad thing to do
And I'm white, what a lucky dude
Sorry for breaking the hip hop rules

I want to apologize
Remake me like you did with Vanilla Ice
Put me on the Surreal Life, with Flavor Flav man
The dude seems nice

My own show, that'd be tight
But what I'd show is the reality of Christ
Then I'd show what He brought to my life
Then I'd show Him whipped 39 times

Then I'd show Him crucified
Then I'd show just when He died
Then I'd show just when He rised
Then I'd show that's He's very much alive

Wait up, hold up, it's over
(I'm washed up y'all)
Wait up, hold up, it's over
(It's all over now y'all)

Wait up, hold up, it's over
(I'm giving up y'all)
Wait up, hold up, it's over
('Cuz I'm washed up y'all)

Dear MTV, I never wrote or been calling
It's been two years and I gots a problem
Played my video but got it all wrong and
Said I dissed Eminem but never played the whole song

You never told the whole story
Played one verse and cut it off at the chorus
Made it look like I did it just to get famous
But I'm back to set it straight

That it's still one love, one way
It's still one blood, one day
He was killed, I call on only one name
One son, what He's done is all that I'll say

You can state that I be just hating
You can state that I be money making
But it's Jesus is all that I'm saying
So go put that in ya rotation

Wait up, hold up, it's over
(I'm washed up y'all)
Wait up, hold up, it's over
(It's all over now y'all)

Wait up, hold up, it's over
(I'm giving up y'all)
Wait up, hold up, it's over
('Cuz I'm washed up y'all)
