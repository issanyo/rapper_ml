[Hook 1]
I just need some time alone
Nobody ring my phone
Can I get some time alone?
Let me get up in my zone (Get up in my zone)

[Verse 1]
Some days I’m an introvert
Wanna get away leave this earth
Broke down I’m getting worse
I'm too proud to admit I’m hurt
Them days when I get berzerk
Them days when life don’t work
I fall apart check my heart
Hit restart hit the dir-dirt
Man I’ma get this work
But I never seem to finish first
I need some help from what I’m dealt
My heart is in a hearse
So mad I'm finna curse
That mess i didn’t deserve
I’m broken choking man
I'ma just let you work

[Hook 2]
I just need some time alone
Nobody ring my phone
Can I get some time alone
Let me get up in my zone (Get up in my zone)
Ain't nothing going right, but man I'm feeling okay
I’m just a mess up in my life I'm feeling okay
I got no sleep last night but man I'm feeling okay
They wanna take me down this time I'm just like no way

[Verse 2]
This life can’t get much worse
That’s why you came to earth
Your Love and grace I didn’t deserve
But Lord I’ve been so burnt
Man up, forgive this hurt
But it never ever seems to work
The place where this occurred
Lord it was all up in your church
That's why it’s hurting worse
They wilding on this earth
Smile up in your face and smirk
While they stealing from your purse (huh)
But I been assured
That’s something I gotta learn
To trust in you that’s just just what I’ll do
Just while I wait my turn I’m like
