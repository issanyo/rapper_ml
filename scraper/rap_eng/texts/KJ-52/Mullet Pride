Verse 1:
I saw a man a walking just the other day
I saw a man a talking and this is what he say he said to me
He said son your hair is real short but in the back it's long
Well if it is and it really is then you can sing my mullet song
(then he said to me)

Chorus:
Do you got a mullet a mullet going on?
Do you got a mullet is it beautiful big and long?
Well If you got a mullet there's no need to hide
Cause it's plain to see just so plain to me that we just need mullet pride

Verse 2/font:
I said sir I have a question there's a question that I must ask
Why is it when I go out in public why do these people stop and laugh?
He said the answer to your question sir it's just so plain to me
Now the problem is just with these kids they got mullet jealousy
(then he said to me)

Chorus

Verse 3:
The moral of the story it goes a little something like this
If you got a mullet well it's a haircut not a fish
And now when you wear your mullet just remember this little fact
See a mullet is business in the front and then a party in the back
(now everybody sing)

Chorus

La la la la la la (repeat)
