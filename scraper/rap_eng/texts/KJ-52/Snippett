That's what I scream from my bedroom
Seems like lately now this is all they do
Sayin things like to each other like
"Shut up!" and "I hate you!"
But now every word cuts me deep
Like knives that stab you
I bury my head under the covers 'cause I have to
Drown out just hearin' my mother now tell my dad to
"Get out the house!"
I wonder when I get the bad news
I hate it when they scream loud
And plus when they shout too
I can't stand what I see
