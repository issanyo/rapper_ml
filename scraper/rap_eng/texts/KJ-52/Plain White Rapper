[Intro]
Yo son
What's up son?
Yo son check out my man's mini-van!
Ah that's that new mini-van son!
Yo he sittin' on like ten-inch rims son!
Ten-inch rims son!
And he got on a Wal-Mart throwback
Yo where'd he get that Wal-Mart throwback?
He got like five-inch speakers up in that thing
What's that kid's name?

[Verse One]
Man, y'all should know who I am
I stay thugged out rollin' out in my mini-van
With my ten-inch rims buggin' out with my little tan
While I'm lettin' 'em spin, Mountain Dew can in my hand
Man, I'm iced out like what?
Well I was iced out when the ice fell out the cup
But I can't help it, I almost ran into a truck
And the ice all melted, the mini-van got stuck
But it's cool, I let my speakers bump
Dude I got five-inch 'woofers in the trunk!
And we still make the party people get up and jump
KJ-Fivetweezy, you know he get it crunk

[Bridge]
Mini-cans is in the house y'all
Mountain Dew is in the house y'all
Ten-inch rims is in the house y'all
Five-inch speakers is in the house y'all

[Hook]
I'm just a plain white rapper
Nothin' more, nothin' else cause it really don't matter
I'm just a plain white rapper
Nothin' more, nothin' else, I don't try to be an actor
I'm just a plain white rapper
Nothin' more, can't you tell, no it ain't Marshall Mathers
I'm just a plain white rapper
Nothin' more, even still you can quit your chit-chatter

[Verse Two]
Fivetweezy
You know the name
'Sup to the soccer moms all up in the place
Driving SUVs, Camry, Lex or the Range
Man, I just bought my CD on the way to the game
You don't have to act your age
Get your hands up, make your kids think you strange
Start dancing, get 'em really now ashamed
Pick 'em up from school, honk the horn, be like "Hey"
Okay, back to the track
I'm a kid in a cap and a Wal-Mart throwback
Yeah, what y'all know about that?
Man, I be putting Cape Coral, Florida on the map

[Bridge]
Soccer moms is in the house y'all
Homeschoolers is in the house y'all
Wal-Mart is in the house y'all
Southwest Florida is in the house y'all

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Ain't nothin' special 'bout me
Ain't the best lookin', ain't the best MC
Now, I'm not a hoodlum, flashy or icy
At the dentist, the only time I get flossy
See all really got is just Christ in me
Who precisely breathe life in me
Just guides me daily and nightly
And never fails me cause he holds tightly
And I know it's just a sight to see
Don't seem right, don't even seem right to me
But all it just means is God gets the glory
And in the end that's all I'm living for, end of story

[Bridge]
Fivetweezy is in the house y'all
T-Cleezy is in the house y'all
So get ya hands up in the house y'all
And let's turn this party out y'all!

[Hook]
