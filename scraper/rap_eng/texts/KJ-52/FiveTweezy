[Intro]
It's Fivetweezy, KJ Fivetweezy
It's Fivetweezy

[Verse 1]
Well, I've been gone but I'm back again
It's been too long, you wondering where I been
Well, I betcha I though I would pack it in
Since I got dissed on MTV for dear slim
Aw, man why'd yall play me?
TRL, you drive me crazy!
Now everybody really hates me!
I thought we were friends, Carson Daley?
So when I tried out for American Idol
I got up and sang for Simon Cowell
But he said I was 'absolutely horrible'
He said I was worse than William Hung, too
Now what do I do, please help me, could ya?
I keep getting punk'd like Ashton Kutcher
Since my name's still bashed and butchered
But I was just changing, so listen would yah

[Hook]
It's Fivetweezy, KJ Fivetweezy
It's Fivetweezy
That's what my friends just call me
It's Fivetweezy, KJ Fivetweezy
It's Fivetweezy
That's what my friends just call me

[Verse 2]
Now I don't know if I'm past my prime
I'm feeling old, I just turned 29
It's crazy; I think I lost my mind
Cause lately it shows I forget my uh:
Sometimes I feel like my brain is missing
Sometimes I feel like Jessica Simpson
Don't know if tuna's fish or chicken
I told ya it's five two, nobody's listens
Okay, you don't believe that it's true
Even my mom still thinks it's fifty-two
Now I tried to explain but it's no use
At least the kids say 'man your cool, ha'
No, really man, I can't complain
Kids take puff paint and write my name
On their t-shirts and they be like WAH!!!
That's why it's time for me to change

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now I used to come through my system blasting
People couldn't miss it when I tried to pass them
In a Honda civic with the muffler dragging
Shoes off, hairy feet like Bilbo Baggins
Back when I was living wrong
I need to get tipsy like J-Kwon
But know a days all I need is God
And a mic and a DJ and my I-Pod
All righty put your dance shoes on
And everybody just get your groove on
We'll rock the party till the break of dawn
And even get your grandma to sing along
Now what I say, don't take this lightly
God runs things, not Bruce Almighty
He's Jesus, the only one I need
Now Fivetweezy, yall know what I mean

[Hook]
