[Verse 1]
I'm lost at the end of my rope
And I'm burning, I'm yearning
I'm hurting for hope
I'm needing this burden to go
But I'm searching for
Purpose, I'm searching to know
It knocks me down to the floor
Till I'm pounding the ground
And I'm down in my hole
It's got me down till I go
Till I cry out to you I
Can't take it no more
You are the one that I hold
You are the one in my soul
You are the one that I know
That will come when I call
And I fall and I fold let's go
C'mon

[Chorus]
I'm at the end of my rope and
I can't take it no more
I think I'm losing control
I am about to let go

I am...

[Verse 2]
So you said to let go
Let everything I had hold
Let go till its all in control
Let go till its gone up in smoke
Crush me mold me make me
Stretch me fold me change me
Until I ain't just the same me
You the only one my safety
You are the one gonna saved me
And I don't wanna ever live safely
Destroy my world and take me
Past the end of my rope break me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Crush me mold me make me
Stretch me fold me change me
(the end, the end of my rope)
Crush me mold me make me
Stretch me fold me change me
(the end, the end of my rope)
