You know it only breaks my heart
To see you standing in the dark (ohh)
You know it always breaks my heart
To see you standing in the dark

I read your post on your facebook
Reminisced on the pics how your face looked
See But now I'm walking away straight shook
You've changed so much you don't got the same look
I guess the pain took its toll I guess the pain took control
I guess the pain went and took your soul
Cause I ain't seen the same one I used to know
You stop going to the places that we used to go
We used to flow man we used to build
We used to stop used to talk and we used to chill
It all stopped now whats the deal
I miss you so much this is how I feel

You know it only breaks my heart
To see you standing in the dark (ohh)
You know it always breaks my heart
To see you standing in the dark
So far apart
So far apart
So far apart
I feel so apart (I miss you)

Can't you see right now just what's going on
You try to close your eyes can't see whats going wrong
That little compromise when you was going strong
But you ignore the signs kept it rolling on
So get ya fake smile proceed to throw it on
Man your living wild all the while sort of calm
So how you living now I hope I'm sort of wrong
Just When I say that I already know what's going on
Still all along just through the thick and thin
Your holding on to your bitterness deep within
Its time to forgive it begins w/ Him
God is knocking on the door let him in

You know it only breaks my heart
To see you standing in the dark (oh)
You know it always breaks my heart
To see you standing in the dark
So far apart
So far apart
So far apart
How did we get so apart

Come back (its never too late)
Come back (it's never too late for you)
Come back (its never too late for you)
And I just want to know why don't you go home
Its never too late for you
