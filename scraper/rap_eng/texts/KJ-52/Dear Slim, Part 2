Dear slim I wrote you but you aint callen
Its been a couple years now since I wrote that song en
Alot has changed now for you and I
I had no clue that I would write a song for you and
It would change some lives
Kids with tears in the eyes
They now come up to me
Showing love to me
And telling me that they look up to me
The effects to me well
Were really kinda strange to see
I only wanted to share with you now
Jesus done for me
But there's a whole nother side to things now
That I come to see
Its a huge influence you got upon on the industry
But enough of me
Cause it's not what I came to say to you
Not a day goes by while I take time to pray for you
Sorry now for what your mom and dad
What they did to you
But I can relate with you
Cause well see dude iv been there too
I know there's a lot of pain and hurt
Now that youv been through
But never forget there's a real love that god gave to you
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la to whom it may concern
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la still to whom it may concern
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la To whom it may concern
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la it's still to whom it may concern
Yo dear slim I wrote you and you still aint callen
Backstage at the vmas someone gave you my song and
I kinda wonderen what you thought man
Or when that guy walked up to you
And talked to you and put it in your hands
Maybe you never liste
