[Verse 1]
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you ain't calling
It's been a couple years now since I wrote that song, and
A lot has changed now for you and I
I had no clue that I would write a song for you and
It would change some lives
Kids with tears in their eyes
They now come up to me
Showing love to me
And telling me that they look up to me
The effects to me, well
It's really kinda strange to see
I only wanted to share with you now
What Jesus done for me
But there's a whole 'nother side to things now
That I come to see
It's a huge influence you got upon on the industry
But enough of me
Cause it's not what I came to say to you
Not a day goes by where I [don't] take time to pray for you
I'm sorry now for what your mom and dad
They did to you
But I can relate with you
Cause well see dude I've been there too
I know there's a lot of pain and hurt
Now that you've been through
But never forget there's a real love God gave to you

[Hook]
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
To whom it may concern
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Still, to whom it may concern
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
To whom it may concern
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
It's still, to whom it may concern

[Verse 2]
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't calling
Backstage at the VMA's someone gave you my song and
I'm kinda wondering what you thought, man
Or when that guy walked up to you
And talked to you and put it in your hands
Maybe you never listen to it or
Maybe you lost it
Or maybe you heard it and you just got mad
And then you tossed it
"Did he diss you back?"
That's the question I always get
And I'm like, "Well, God forbid that you might even have liked it."
I don't know but
Congratulations on your movie yo and
Heard your last record well, it's over ten million sold
But there's one thing that's really got me thinking bro
Does a Grammy mean anything if it's just gotta cost your soul?
In case you didn't know, there's a love that will never go away
You say you're going to hell but it don't have to be that way
See the bottom line of what I'm trying to say is
God puts back together the broken pieces
That are were thrown away
If even everyone you know
Just up and goes away
He'll still love you till the very day
That you're old and gray
Too bad a lot of Christians all they do is hate on you
Instead of dropping to their knees
And taking time to pray for you
And it's obvious that you really love your daughter dude
And for that I gotta tell you, well, I really got respect for you
So here it is, Dear Slim, Chapter Part 2
Another cat trying to make it just like you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, Dear Slim, did you hear the junk that I'm going through
Kids sending me hate mail and telling me
How I'm biting you
Telling me how they gonna beat me up and just kill me too
But a lot of people they just seem to get my song confused
See what I say to you I know it might even sound funny
But I never came at you just to paint you has the enemy
It wasn't about hating you or starting some controversy
It wasn't about blaming you or trying to make some money
I don't claim to know everything that you've experienced
Man I don't even know if you even ever be hearing this
But I said it once and I still hold to this
Is that a life with out Christ is still a life that is never fixed
I'll tell you this even if it's a hard pill to swallow
Like it or not Slim, you will always be a role model
Do you know these kids, we're the ones they always follow
What we say and how we live gives them a better tomorrow
I've had my share of some, plus man I've been rejected
I've been chewed up, spit out, and cussed; disrespected
But if I die today and never sell another record
Jesus gave me more than I ever could of been expected
I know life is hectic, it can leave you blown away
But check it bro cause we all just gonna die someday
And on that note, well, there's only one thing left to say
There's still one love and one god and only one way
