They say we crazy but we don't care
They say we crazy but we don't care
I be going mental
I be going mental
You he they be we be going mental
I be going mental

You he they be we be going mental

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
I'm almost 4-0
But feeling like I'm half of that
You blind to the truth
You like some old dudes with cataracts
My God will crack the roof
And boom the sky like it's rat-a-tat
So I grab the track
Ride the rap like the saddle back
Searching for directions
Like some tags on a apple map
Never learned my lesson
What I had I tried to grab it back
Then I start repenting then
And Heaven became my habitat
And now we kind of tight like
He man and battle cat
Tell me what you laughing at
Y'all just need to go with me
Y'all just need to face the fact
That you need to roll with me
I get so amazed that He died and rose
And he came as the lion king
But you treat him like hello kitty
Hello diddy (wassup?)
Hello jay (yo!)
Wassup fiddy?
Wassup wayne?
You know my king
The one who runs down the whole thing?
In case you never understand
Here's why we go cray

[Pre-Hook: Soul-Glo Activatur]
They say we crazy but we don't care
They say we crazy but we don't care

They say we crazy but we don't care

[Hook]
I be going mental
I be going mental
You he they be we be going mental
I be going mental

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
I be going mental (Duh)
That's what we fin to go now
Even if it hurts I got to get it
It's about to go down
He chose to get me He rolling with me
He could've killed me no smoke and pistol
Alive now
On fire now
Can't be tied down it's worldwide
All around the country they losing it yeah
Get used to it
Off is how I used to live
But now it's only through the switch
Unashamed it's not a game man
We passionate
It's about to get crazy
Baby make sure you fasten it
Crazy
That's what they say
Mental
That's what they think
If you been through what I been through
Then you might just go insane
They say we crazy but we don't care
Man I was crazy 'fore I got here

[Hook]

[Verse 3: KJ-52]
You he they be we be going mental
From the back and the front it's packing a pump
That's smacking and racking them up
I rap and attack the stuff they happen to love we snatching them up
They acting a punk they bragging it up
And they laugh and they cracking em up
They claim they backing it up but all I got is a love
He came in the flesh He came and he left when He rose to the sky and above
He came with a death He came and He went for those recognized in the blood
He came and He bled I claim what He said 'cause all I have is the one
That came and He lived and I claim what He did
So I rap and brag on the Son like

[Pre-Hook: Soul-Glo Activatur]

They say we crazy but we don't care
