[Verse 1: KJ-52]
I’m not the lame broken down child
One thing on his mind and his brain
I’m not the same, I’m not the guy
Who was living to die for the fame
My life is changed I found the way
And the truth and life when He came
And I got to say, never return to the man
I was back in the day
I'm on my way, I'm on my way till He calls me away
I'm not ashamed, I got an army about to invade
My God is great, forever and ever and ever He reigns
And all I can say whatever, whenever, whatever I face
What you think, I’m giving up? I ain't giving up (like nah bruh)
What you think, I had enough? I ain't had enough (like nah bruh)
What you think, I’m finished up? I ain't finished up (like nah bruh)
They be just like (nah bruh)
We be just like (nah bruh)

[Hook: Canon]
If you ain't bout that action get up out my face
I keep coming right back just like a holiday
They looking up at me like I'm out of bounds
I'm rolling with the One I know Who hold me down
The ball in my court and errybody going
The ball in my court and errybody going
Now all my soldiers bout to sound off
So come and try to block, we be like nah bruh
Eh brah, eh brah, eh brah, we be like nah brah
Eh brah, eh brah, eh brah, we be like nah brah

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
A life filled with pain
Running the streets while I'm watching the train
Wishing I’m free but I’m locked in the game
Looking for peace but I’m doomed to the flame
I was speaking Your name
Spoken in vain I was going insane
But I broke out the chain the moment You came
My loss is a gain
I'm back from the dead, hear me I'm back from the dead
You hearing the facts that I give my passion to live
Is from all that He did
And I'm not the kid I ran and I hid, that's the man that I been
But he's buried and dead never returning to live
Never see him again

[Hook: Canon]
If you ain't bout that action get up out my face
I keep coming right back just like a holiday
They looking up at me like I'm out of bounds
I'm rolling with the one I know who hold me down
The ball in my court and errybody going
The ball in my court and errybody going
Now all my soldiers bout to sound off
So come and try to block, we be like nah bruh
Eh brah, eh brah, eh brah, we be like nah brah
Eh brah, eh brah, eh brah, we be like nah brah

[Verse 3: B. Cooper]
Let me tell you the story of how I met up with the Glorious
I hope you were recording this
Got me stretched out like accordions
Get down to the core of us like apples, MacBooks on a tour bus
Gremlins the water we found make more of us
Crazy how my life changed creation that’s right brained
God of the whole universe
Came down to earth and took my pain (my pain)
Hallelujah (Hallelujah) this a new life
Walked away from death, there’s no way that I can lose right?

[Hook: Canon]
If you ain't bout that action get up out my face

The ball in my court and errybody going
The ball in my court and errybody going
Now all my soldiers bout to sound off
So come and try to block, we be like nah bruh
Eh brah, eh brah, eh brah, we be like nah brah
Eh brah, eh brah, eh brah, we be like nah brah

[Outro]
Eh brah, eh brah, eh brah, we be like nah brah
Eh brah, eh brah, eh brah, we be like nah brah
