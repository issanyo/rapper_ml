[Verse 1: Michael Tait]
Separated, I cut myself clean
From a past that comes back in my darkest of dreams
Been apprehended by a spiritual force
And a grace that replaced all the me I divorced

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
I saw a man with a tat on his big fat belly
It wiggled around like marmalade jelly
It took me a while to catch what it said ‘cause I had to match the rhythm of his belly with my head
“Jesus Saves” is what it raved in a typical tattoo green
He stood on a box in the middle of the city and he claimed he had a dream…

[Hook]
What will people think when they hear that I’m a Jesus freak?
What will people do when they find that it’s true?
I don’t really care if they label me a Jesus freak – there ain’t no disguising the truth
No I ain’t into hiding the Truth

[Verse 2: Michael Tait]
Kamikaze, my death is gain
I’ve been marked by my Maker, a peculiar display
The high and lofty, they see me as weak
But I won’t live and die for the power they seek

[Verse 3: KJ-52]
There was a man from the desert with naps in his head
The sand that he walked was also his bed
The words that he spoke make the people assume there wasn’t too much left in the upper room
With skins on his back and hair on his face, they thought he was strange from the locusts he ate
All the Pharisees tripped when they heard him speak until the king took the head of this Jesus freak…
[Hook]

[Bridge: Michael Tait]
People say I’m strange, does it make me a stranger?
My best friend was born in a manger

[Outro]
What will people think (what will people think?)
What will people do (what will people do?)
I don’t really care (what else can I say?)
There ain’t no disguising the Truth (Jesus is the Way)
