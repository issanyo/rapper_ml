[Intro: Ambassador]
You ever been in a place of brokenness? (mm-mm-mm)
You might be there right now, (mhm)
Takes love to get you out
And that's what He does... (yup)
That's what He did

[Hook: Michelle Bonilla]
You cried for the broken (uh-huh)
You lived for the hopeless
You died for the guilty
So that we could be righteous (it's good news)
You took away the shame
You wiped the tears away (yesss)
And I am amazed, Ooooh yeeeeaaaah
Of Your love for me

[Verse 1: Ambassador]
Anybody ever tell you that they love you? Of course they have
It's almost automatic, we all endorse the habit
We say it but don't display it, we could do better
It's just a few letters until it gets some shoe leather
'Cuz when the rubber meets the road, we see a tree
Where blood was leaked, and this is more love than we can hold
Love saw me in the deepest hole
Started reachin', you ask if i was seekin'? No
I was sinkin' low, on the brink of throwin' in the towel
No hope, like on a singing show, singing foul
But the Judge saved me and His love bathed me
Bug maybe, but I'm clean and that's love baby
It's not a diva, gets biz like a beaver
Sees a need and sleeves roll up like Wiz Khalifa
But this is neither, that's meager
I'm talkin' love off the meter and that's Jesus (yeah)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
Yo
So when it comes to Your love we got a lot to say
Put this in your ear bud like headphones from Dr. Dre
Had you locked away, stuck you in a rocky cave
Put you in a tomb and took a stone, went and blocked the grave
They assumed that You had up and gone away
I see the truth, it was you up and haunted me
It's all new so when they moved and pulled the rock away
Found it all empty 'cuz we have all gone astray
But simply you give me love and I gots to say
You're enough for the junk that I gots to face
You're the Son who gives light into the darkest day
Stopped the funeral, cut the music, You are the Way
My life is changed, went from sin to godly
Your promises are all yes not "sorta, prob'ly"
It's most def like the other dude down with Kweli
It's no death 'cuz He cured, now with how you got me

[Hook x2]
