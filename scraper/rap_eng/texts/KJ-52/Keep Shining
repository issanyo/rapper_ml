(feat. Goldinchild)

[Chorus:]
(C'mon) Keep shining shining
(Set this place on fire)and keep shining shining
(And let the flame burn higher)Just shine it shine it
(get 'em up stick 'em up push 'em up)

[Goldinchild:]
Here we go S.O.I on the song again
Spit the word and burn bright like halogen
No matter the flow the glow gone draw them in
He's the light that the dark can't comprehend
Illuminates hitting things in the hearts of men
The lamp that leads men back to God again
Everything the Old Testament promises
Son of Man manifested in godliness
Calling us to be the salt and the light
Reflecting his image in the darkest of nights
Shining the glory that's larger than life
We part of the story the author is Christ
Alpha Omega the start of your life
The truth who separates wrong from the right
Lord and Messiah power and might
God in the flesh so let there be light

[Chorus:]
(C'mon) Keep shining shining
(Set this place on fire)and keep shining shining
(And let the flame burn higher) Just shine it shine it
(get 'em up stick 'em up push 'em up)

[KJ-52:]
Set my life on fire now
Burn so bright you can't put the fire out
Let my whole life ignite and just shine about
Till everyone every time knows what I'm about
In every word every line coming out the mouth
Let it burn let it shine till they find it out
Till they've heard every rhyme and without a doubt
They can learn about Christ the Messiah now
They say they need him but they deny it now
Cause you don't want to meet him you just try him out
And every time I see them every time I'm out
You ignore what I'm speaking and I rhyme about
So let your fire burn never put it out
It's time for you and I to take it higher now
We gonna call and bring the fire down
No matter who you are hear us crying out

[Chorus:]
(C'mon) Keep shining shining
(Set this place on fire)and keep shining shining
(And let the flame burn higher)Just shine it shine it
(get 'em up stick 'em up push 'em up)

[KJ-52:]
I'm so sure what I came to do
Cause I don't ever want to ever be ashamed of you
And as the world turns what I say to you
Well let your word burn like a flame would do
Until they all heard what I say and do
Cause I'm so sure they ain't never knew
Listen closer and I'll proclaim to you
I chose ta approach ya then explain to you
I told ya showed ya when I came at you
He rose up and goes up it was plain in view
He said wait for it then in a day or two
He straight poured it on out in the upper room
Then the fire fell on a chosen few
It wasn't just done for a couple dudes
That power is still around now for me and you
But what you gonna do who you gonna choose

[Chorus:]
(C'mon) Keep shining shining
(Set this place on fire)and keep shining shining
(And let the flame burn higher)Just shine it shine it
(get 'em up stick 'em up push 'em up)
