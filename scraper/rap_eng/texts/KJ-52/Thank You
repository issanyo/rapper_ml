Dear dad, I wanna take time to write to you
'cause lately we haven't talked like we used to
See I was thinkin' 'bout all the things we been through
I wanna say right now; I really miss you
You used to tell me when I was a little dude
That there's nothin' that, we couldn't get through
So as I'm old I wanna take time to thank you
And let you know that every day I try to pray for you
See I appreciate everything that you did
You were there for me, ever since a little kid
Taught me to be a man and just how yo live
And when I needed it, you always had love to give
Tears are runnin' down my face as I'm writin' this
'cause you not bein' here is what I really miss
But the one that I just really wish
Is that you know that I love you so I tell you this

Daddy
Thank you for being my daddy
(I just wanna thank you)
Daddy
Thank you for being my daddy
(I just wanna thank you...)

You might blame yourself for you and mom splitin' up
But I wanna tell you; don't beat yourself up
That's in the past now, what's done is done
You'l always be my dad, and I'll always be your son
Sometimes the most important words we don't say enough
Sometimes love hurts, it hurts way to much
Sometimes we act the verry worst to the ones we love
Sometimes we just wanna hug

Now mom i wanna thank you for everything
For all the times you were there to provide my needs
And I wanna thank you for always just loving me
Despite all the trouble sometimes I used to be
You showed me just what I'm suppose to be
And it still means alot to hear you're proud of me
And just to be your son is what I'm proud to be
So I love you and I say thanks while the kids sing:

Mommy
Thank you for being my mommy
(I just wanna thank you)
Mommy
Thank you for being my mommy
(I just wanna thank you...)

For a while mom, we really didn't talk much
But I'm glad, lately we stay in touch
Can you believe how much your little boy is growin' up
Seems like yesterday I was so young
Time passes so fast, and you know what
It's words like "I Love You" I don't say enough
And everything that you've done means so much
So thank you mom, that's love from your oldest son

Now Lord I wanna thank you for what you've done
You're my father in Heaven and I'm your son
Your also the source where my peace comes from
And you'll still be my father even if I never had one
I was lost but you changed the outcome
You put your son on the cross, and just let run
To lay down your life, just no grater love for someoe
And that's exactly what you've done

Jesus
Thank you for being my Jesus
(I just wanna thank you)
Jesus
Thank you for being my Jesusu
(I just wanna thank you)

Jesus
Thank you for being my Jesus
(I just wanna thank you)
Jesus
Thank you for being my Jesusu
(I just wanna thank you)
