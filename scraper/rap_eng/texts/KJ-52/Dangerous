[Hook]
Can't forgive, or forget
We hold on
And it's dangerous
It's dangerous
We resent
We regret
We look back
But it's dangerous
Livin' like we do is so dangerous

[Verse 1]
Ay yo
I wanna hit you up
Ain't got the words to say
'Cause all the junk we do
It's pushin' you further away
And every time I see you actin' like it's all okay
You were the one I ever thought would fall away
I never thought you'd change
Never thought you'd stray
Run right back to the very things I know you hate
With all you're going through
Now Tell me why you go this way
Caught up in the junk, going where ya' came
Caught up on the run
Ya' everyday the same
You hold your head up high
Livin' it without no shame
And everyday gets a little harder just to pray
If I could sit you down
Here's what I'd say

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Your wings are broken
Yet you keep on flyin'
Every time I talk to you, you never recognize it
Holdin' on to your past that you keep denyin'
Tryin' to mask your hurt in all the junk that you tryin'
Yet I'd be lyin'
If I said it's all okay
You're missin' church man
It's gettin' worse today
It's obvious that you're hurt
And that's the role you play
The one where you blame and push everybody away
I have to say
That He's the one you need
The One that died, crucified, there on the tree
The final thing I gotta say now honestly
The one I'm talking about...is me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Continuing from hook]
It's a long, hard road to nowhere
And we're havin' trouble findin' our way
And it's a long, hard road to nowhere
Need somethin' different
Someone help me to change

[Hook] (x2)
