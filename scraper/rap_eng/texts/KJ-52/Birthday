[Verse 1]
Yeah, I wanna hop in a new whip, drop the top, hit the spot with my two friends (Okay)
I wanna hang with the cool kids but all I ever rock is the car with the two rims (Haha)
Everyday I pursue Him, He got the clues and the rules to the blueprint
Uh, and I'ma move to the groove, and can I get a little bit of cake with the CoolWhip
'Cause everyday is a birthday, I need grace in the worst way
I'm on a race to the first place, brand new like the first day of the first grade (C'mon)
And I'ma live it up, and anything holding me back there, I'ma give it up (Uh)
I can't get enough (Nah), I ain't quitting up, 'til I'm finished up, now get 'em up

[Chorus]
I'm loving everyday like its my birthday (Woah-oh) Woah-oh (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
And I'm living everyday like its my birthday (Woah-oh) Woah-oh (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Whoo, [?], its your birthday, uh
Can't [?], its your birthday
I'm living everyday like its my birthday (Woah-oh)
[?], its your birthday
(Woah-oh, woah-oh)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I want more love and less hate
I want more give and less take
More real and some less fake
And I know that my best friend
Is in you even when I got less faith
From the worst to the best day
I'ma celebrate, no matter what the rest say, yup
No matter if I'm getting hate
I'ma proclaim The Name, thats the best name, yup
'Cause it wasn't in the best space
Walked around like a head case
And I didn't have the best fate
That's when You showed up in the best way
Some nights I got no rest
Some nights I was so stressed
But I woke up being so blessed
I was hopeless, but I know where the hope is

[Chorus]
Loving everyday like its my birthday (Woah-oh), woah-oh, (Woah-oh) and woah-oh
And I'm living everyday like its my birthday (Woah-oh), woah-oh, (Woah-oh) woah-oh
[?], its your birthday
[?] what, its your birthday
Yeah, [?] its your birthday

[Verse 3]
I'm too old to be feeling this young
Man, I'm feeling so young
Got me feeling so young, uh
'Cause everyday is your birthday
I'm too old to be feeling this young
Man, I'm feeling so young
Got me feeling so young, uh
'Cause everyday is your birthday
And I'm too old to be feeling this young
Feeling this young, feeling so young
Everyday is your birthday
I'm too old to be feeling this young
Feeling this young, feeling so young
Everyday is your birthday

[Chorus]
Loving everyday like its my birthday (Woah-oh), woah-oh, (Woah-oh) and woah-oh
And I'm living everyday like its my birthday (Woah-oh), woah-oh, (Woah-oh) woah-oh
[?], its your birthday, uh, uh
