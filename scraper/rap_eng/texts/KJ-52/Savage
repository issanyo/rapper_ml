[Verse 1: KJ-52]
Yo, I might just roll away on a roller blade at a old parade
I might rock a old baret with a tat of a cat on my shoulder blade
I might start a whole new way for white boy rappers
That are old and gray
I might even somethin' somethin'
I don't even know what I was gonna say
I might take yo Chick-Fil-A eat a bite right in front of you
And throw it away  (Savage)
Imma take your drink away
Take your Mountain Dew dump it in the drain  (Savage)
If you beat me right there on a PSP that I go to play
Imma hit reset (Uh, Yeah)
Start up a whole new game (Savage)

[Chorus: Canon]

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
C'mon
So right back in the day
I wanna blow up real quick like an old grenade (Ah)
I didn't know the way to go, and I was lost real good
I didn't know the Name (no)
I thought I was goin' insane
I was just a kid in the hood that was thrown away
But You stepped in real quick (real quick)
Yeah I gave my soul away (yo)
So now with no delay
I'ma let em all know where to show the way
What's that?
They ain't gotta hit the j just get high blow the smoke away

The God that I serve I know first hand
The hands just go to saving
