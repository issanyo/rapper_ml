[Verse 1]
Just a kid with the world at my feet
Breathe in my lungs not a thing that I need
Top down with my girl on my seat
And I’m dumb and in love and I’m young and I'm free
I like the way you rocking to the beat
I like the way you rocking them sneaks
I like the way you talking to me
Just when you walking with me when we walking the street
You laughing at the jokes that I speak
Then we laugh till there's tears on our cheek
Two kids with the world on a leash
And I know and I know your a blessing to me, and that's why

[Chorus]
One time for the guys that married up
2 times for the women that hold it down
3 times for that always be around
You got my heartbeat on lockdown

I want you close to me
You never get old to me
You got my heartbeat on lockdown, oh
I want you close to me
You never get old to me
You got my heartbeat on lockdown, down

And even though we grown up
I’m like so what still go nuts when you roll up
Man I’m like hold up how did I wind up
With a hot girl so cold what
Got me froze up
God knew what to do when he made you sho nuff
And he chose us
And I love it all from head down to the toes up

[Chorus]
One time for the guys that married up
2 times for the women that hold it down
3 times for that always be around
You got my heartbeat on lockdown, oh
I want you close to me
You never get old to me
You got my heartbeat on lockdown, oh
I want you close to me
You never get old to me
You got my heartbeat on lockdown, down

[Verse 3]
No question no guessing
I like the way you walk and your dressing
Your a gift girl you’re a blessing
All wrapped up in my best friend
No question no guessing
I like the way you walk and your dressing
Your a gift girl you’re a blessing
All wrapped up in my best friend

[Chorus]
One time for the guys that married up
2 times for the women that hold it down
3 times for that always be around
You got my heartbeat on lockdown, oh
I want you close to me
You never get old to me
You got my heartbeat on lockdown, oh
I want you close to me
You never get old to me
You got my heartbeat on lockdown, down
