[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Aye, yo, so while you're up north there ya gettin'   getting freezed out
I'm down south walkin' around town with my knees out (Ah)
Feelin' the breeze now with the palm trees out
And unless it's the ocean, well, I don’t pull the ski’s out, uh (No)
So don’t be hatin' all on me, pal
'Cause it’s all green and there’s no brown leaves out (Yup, yup)
This is Florida and I don’t plan to leave now
And the only thing I gotta make sure is the pool cleaned out (Uh)
Oh, I'm sorry, is that a turn off?
'Cause your lips are purple and chapped and about to burn off (Yeah)
Tryin' to get all the sand and the dirt off
My feet 'cause I’m at the beach loungin' with the shirt off (Uh)
Take a turtle and a gator and then I go dip (Go dip)
And ride a manatee off into the sunset (Yeah)
'Are we there, Dad, are we havin' fun yet?'
'Sit down, hush up, button up your one lip' (Uh)

[Chorus]
'Cause it's the best time of the year
Best time of the year
And I'ma make it real clear
It's the best time of the year, aw yeah, aw yeah, yeah
I say, 'yup yup,' it's the best time of the year
It's the best time of the year
And I'ma make it real clear
It's the best time of the year
Best time of the year
Bring it back, come on

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I be like, 'Merry Christmas, get this on your wish list
Fingers on the wrist, get froze like a fish stick
As the time tick ticks ya really might miss this
All you wanna do is drop the dough like it’s Bisquick
But you in the snow with ya six kids
Smashin' through the road in ya town or ya district (Uh)
'Cause the crowds are a thick clique
And your nose won’t stop runnin', man, you’re gettin' sick quick (Ah)
Before you checkin' off the list, kid
I came to remind you o' this, this (Yup)
Reason of the season ain't just a gift list (Nah)
It's Jesus the greatest gift, man, that a gift gives self

[Chorus]
'Cause it's the best time of the year
Best time of the year
And I'ma make it real clear
It's the best time of the year, aw yeah, aw yeah, yeah
I say, 'yup yup,' it's the best time of the year
Best time of the year
And I'ma make it real clear
It's the best time of the year, aw yeah, aw yeah, yeah, aw yeah, yeah
Come on

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Outro]
'Cause it's the best time of the year
Best time of the year
And I'ma make it real clear
It's the best time of the year, aw yeah, aw yeah, yeah, yeah
I say, 'yup yup,' it's the best time of the year
Best time of the year
And I'ma make it real clear
It's the best time of the year, aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
(Oh, oh)
Come on
