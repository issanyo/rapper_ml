[Chorus]
It ain't no good for you you better let it go
Everything you holding to you better let it go
Now you know what to do you better let it go
Everything that you been through you better let it go
You better let it go
Don't lose you're soul
You better let it go
Don't lose you're soul

[Verse 1]
I was like come on girl
Now why you let him run your world
Ya back to the same old jerk
Right back to the same old hurt
You don't even seem concerned
Plus you never ever seem to learn
Now it never ever ever seems to work
Ya seem assured but I seen you search
Ya looking for a little bit more
Plus you feel just a little bit raw
Now you never ever seem to get far
How long till you leaving it all
How long till you're hearing him call
See I'm tired of just fearing you fall
Every lyric that's appeared in this song
Its my hope that you hearing it all (let it go)

[Chorus]
It ain't no good for you you better let it go
Everything you holding to you better let it go
Now you know what to do you better let it go
Everything that you been through you better let it go
You better let it go
Don't lose you're soul
You better let it go
Don't lose you're soul

[Verse 2]
I was like c'mon dude
How long you gonna hold on to
Everything that you just went through
You walk around like ya broke in two
I know it ain't going smooth
You smile but you so confused
You get by but you go and cruise
Ya spend time just soaked in booze
So you're crushed and bruised
And it's time to adjust those views
Ya live life but ya such a fool
Cause there is Christ but you just refused
Its guaranteed you just gone lose
All the things that you just pursued
Another scene that's just been viewed
Let it go is what ya just gone do

[Chorus]
It ain't no good for you you better let it go
Everything you holding to you better let it go
Now you know what to do you better let it go
Everything that you been through you better let it go
You better let it go
Don't lose you're soul
You better let it go
Don't lose you're soul

Ya better let it go
Every thing that you just gone hold
Every bit of the silver and gold
It ain't worth the very cost of you're soul
Ya better let it go
Every thing that you just gone hold
Every bit of the silver and gold
It ain't worth the very cost of you're soul
