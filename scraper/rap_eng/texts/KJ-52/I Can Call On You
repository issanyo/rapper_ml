He didn't know what to do
Came home from after school
Mom and dad said they were through
Now pretty soon he's gonna have to move
Shut the door went inside his room
Laid on the floor and he cried to you
Said Jesus please help me through
Right now i just feel so confused
Don't know what I'm supposed to do
But I need to be close to you
Help me with what I'm goin' through
'cause i know that your here when I'm callin' you
Everything's just fallin' through
But ain't nuttin' too hard for you
So please come when I call to you
'Cause all that I have is all in you
And that's why

I can, I can call on you
I know that you'll hear me
I can, I can call on you
I know that you'll answer
I can, I can call on you
I know that you'll hear me
I can, I can call on you (I can call on you)
I know that you'll answer

She didn't know what to say
She got the phone call and it was late
It was a hit and run just on the free way

And her son got hurt and was in bad shape
Tears ran down her face
As her mind began to race
Didn't know what to do what move to make
So she called up to you and began to pray
Jesus she began to say I need you in a major way
My son might die today I'm so confused please provide a way
Please now just give me strength
Please just help me face everything that's about to come my way
In you I trust and put my faith that's why (that's why)

I can, I can call on you
I know that you hear me
I can, I can call on you
I know that you answer (I know that you'll answer)
I can I can call on you (I can call on you)
I know that you hear me
I can I can call on you
I know that you answer (I know that you answer)

So what I wanna say tonight
Anything thing you face in life
When your mind is filled with strife
You can always find strength in Christ
Even times when the money is tight
Even times when nothin' is right
Don't worry bout nothin' in life call him and that's my advice
And that's why that's why that's why (that's why)

(praying)

I know that you hear me
I can I can call on you I know that you answer I know that you answer
I can I can call on you I can call on you
I know that you answer
