Your love is my sunshine Jesus everywhere that I go
Your love is my sunshine Jesus this is all that I know
Your love is my sunshine Jesus everywhere that I go
Your love is my sunshine Jesus this is all that I know

Hey yo I'm gazing at the skyline watching sun shine
Let my mind unwind and rewinding to the time when my eyes was blind
See the pride I hid behind it just killed my mind
But left me thinking I was fine but really I couldn't see the signs
When all that time your son is shining on me
It's right above me it's bright and lovely but I just won't see
I'm running from the son's beams scared of what I don't see
Just while the son be blazing on me because he knows me
And I can feel the sun shining on my skin
I run and hide inside close the blinds to keep the son from shining in
So much time I spend running from the son light's that's peeking in
I'm weakening and I probably will never see again
But just then it's a ray of light just blazing bright
The first time in my life just when my dark night just came to life
See I'm just the type with all my might to pick a fight
But for some reason I'm standing here soaking up this light

Your love is my sunshine Jesus everywhere that I go
Your love is my sunshine Jesus this is all that I know
Your love is my sunshine Jesus everywhere that I go
Your love is my sunshine Jesus this is all that I know

The thing about the light of the son is right when he comes
Even if you right in the slums you'll still see the light that he's brung
Ain't a thing existing on this earth without the son's light
Most might ignore the son whenever they live they life
Others want the son to shine but they don't want it bright
They choose a darker light so they can live they life with darker nights
But that's a harder life I'd rather just embrace the light
And blaze the mic cause even the deadest person I seen come to life
You see the son be shining on my skin and warms me from deep within
I can't keep it in I got this peace within
The son of man I made my peace with Him
That's why you see me grin and every single day you gone see me seeking him
I got's to speak again about the son who's freeing men
I'm taking in the son just like the oxygen I'm breathing in
And my deepest scars the son light be healing them
I think it's just going to be a sonny day now once again
