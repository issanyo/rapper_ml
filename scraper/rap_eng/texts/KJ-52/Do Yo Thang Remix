(feat. B Reith)

[Intro:]
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (uh huh)
Gone do my thang gone' still gone do my thang (hey)
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (uh huh)
Gone do my thang gone' still gone do my thang (hey)

[Chorus:]
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (man I keep saying)
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (can you hear me say)
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (cause I keep saying)
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang

[KJ-52:]
Who's idea was this?
Well it shouldn't been mine cause I think I'm gone quit
Cause what I've seen is the thing I don't get
Well since a teen well I think I don't fit
Now what I mean when I'm thinking on it
Well it kind of seems I'm a little off bit
Cause what I seen is the older I get
I'm a never grow up still a little old kid
And even when I'm old and I'm balding
I'm a still stay balling making crank calls and
Hauling crawling up down the halls and
While I'm in my wheelchair while I'm bumping Phil Collins
And I'll be leaning on the wall and with
Medicare and a bunch of geritol and
Grey hairs won't even be a problem
I do my thing so keep talking

I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (man I keep saying)
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (can you hear me say)
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (cause I keep saying)
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang

[B. Reith:]
Hold up guess who just stepped in the room
Here to answer a couple of questions
Or better yet make a suggestion
To those who don't know me listen up class is in session
Let the cameras click on let the press in
I try my best to make a good first impression
They trying to box me in like a full court press me
I been around the block now I ain't no freshman
Stay fresher than breath mints and even if I lose my swag
I gotta let my testament direct attention to the risen King
So I'm a keep a doing a doing a doing my thang
I got a message for the young and restless
A new definition of what a true success is
So you loosen the grip of Satan's death wish
Keep doing ya thing the way God meant it

[Chorus:]
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (man I keep saying)
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (can you hear me say)
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (cause I keep saying)
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang

[KJ-52:]
And so I'm rocking the rhyme
To see you transformed like Optimus Prime
It's up to ya'll you can all fall in line
You can stop and rewind and get chance now to find
Real peace that will open you mind
So you can cope when the times gets hopeless and blind
I got a hope that I'm hoping ya find
So your don't fall behind when He opens the sky
And if you're broken in life
Well I've spoken tonight just to focus the light
On the hope that I know is in Christ
Cause the moment you hold it you know you arrived
And if you came to get live
Well it's safe you can bet in the place here tonight
What I got it will change up ya life
And I'm a do my thing one change at a time

[Chorus:]
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (man I keep saying)
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (can you hear me say)
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (cause I keep saying)
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang

I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang
(uh huh)
Gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (hey)
I'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang
(uh huh)
Gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (hey)

This is how I sing because I can't sing
They put this effect on my voice because I can't sing
But if you wanna sing and you can't sing
Then put this effect on your voice and they gone think you sing
