Verse Kj-52:
I'm up in the morning
Jumpin' on up and I'm yawnin'
See the rain is now pourin'
But I'm up and I'm soarin
I ain't worrin' or mowin'
I know the one that I'm hope in
I know the one that I go with
He's my one and my only
Plus, when I'm feelin' alone
That 's when you guidin' me home
That 's when you rightin' the wrong
That 's when you gotta be on
That 's when you gave me the song
I can not go on my own
Nope!
I can not make it alone
I am weak and you're strong
That's the one thing that I know

Chorus:
And I saw the light
And I saw the light
And I saw the light, saw the light
And I saw the light

Verse:
Now, I woked up and I hopped in
Flyin' high in this cockpit
Two times I might lost it
But if I'm small, my God 's big
And I stand tall
Won't quit. won't fall
Won't slip
I go on till they all ig'
Cause you hold me up and with both hands

Chorus:
When I wake up in the morning, take my first breath
I thank God for the moment cause I'm so blessed
Thank God for the them times when I'm so stressed
Can't have a testimony if you've never had a test

And I saw the light
And I saw the light
And I saw the light, saw the light
And I saw the light

Verse:
Now, I woked up and I hopped in
Feelin' good when I walked in
Feelin' good cause I call him
'Cause he's the one that I talk with
And uh,  sometimes I might fall quick
But I'm back up and I'm all-in
I'm backed up and I'm locked in
That's the key right there, like a locksmith

Its like a hit the lotto
Feels like you own tomorrow
Feels like you know my sorrow
That road is hollow, but I know to follow
You know the motto
Full speed when I hit the throttle
Both feet in go to fall
And I'm living these streets like
There's no tomorrow when I say...

Chorus:
When I wake up in the morning, take my first breath
I thank God for the moment cause I'm so blessed
Thank God for the them times when I'm so stressed
Can't have a testimony if you've never had a test

And I saw the light
And I saw the light
And I saw the light, saw the light
And I saw the light
