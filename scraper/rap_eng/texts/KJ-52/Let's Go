[Verse 1: KJ-52]
I flip rhymes like acro (batic)
So pump it up till they hear it in the back row
Stuff em in till it’s packed tho
And let em all know till it all goes to the back do’
Let the facts show you can see this
He’s just my thesis and on that note
Till its caught like a lasso
Its gonna stay on my thought like the spot where the hat go

[Pre-Chorus: Trevor McNevan]
Don’t let it get in your way
It’s up to you what you create
Now let’s all stand up and sing
With everything you can bring

[Chorus]
Let’s go, let’s roll
Everybody off the wall
Let’s go(let’s go), let’s roll
Let’s go, let’s roll
Get your backs up off the wall
Let’s go(let’s go), let’s roll
Let’s go, let’s roll
Everybody off the wall
Let’s go(let’s go), let’s roll
Let’s go, let’s roll
If ya feeling it then get on the floor
Let’s go(let’s go), let’s roll (let’s roll)

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
You rocking with a nat-rull who got a knack fo’
Making it more hot than Tabasco
I got mad folk white and black folk
Who understand that it ain't about the cash flow
We all up in the same boat
With a plan just to stand back to back w/ my famo
Still standing in my camo
And the mic be the handle the word be the ammo

[Pre-Chorus: Trevor McNevan]
Don’t let it get in your way
It’s up to you what you create
Now let’s all stand up and sing
With everything you can bring

[Chorus]
Let’s go, let’s roll
Everybody off the wall
Let’s go(let’s go), let’s roll
Let’s go, let’s roll
Get your backs up off the wall
Let’s go(let’s go), let’s roll
Let’s go, let’s roll
Everybody off the wall
Let’s go(let’s go), let’s roll
Let’s go, let’s roll
If ya feeling it then get on the floor
Let’s go(let’s go), let’s roll (let’s roll)

[Outro]
I want to know
If you want to fly
Then come on lets roll
I want to know
If you want to fly
Then come lets go
