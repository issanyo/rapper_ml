[Intro: Derek Minor]
They see me shining and I'm popping
But I came from the darkness
They don’t know what I did to get up out of it
Well you should know about it, yo

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
So I'm a go to war never should’ve let us in
Just a veteran with medicine like Excederin
I see your life is all dead in sin
So I drop a light just for the world like it’s Edison
Let me in you looking cock eyed
Ya two-face screw-face head-flopped lop-side
I am an emcee with a pop side
So all these years you think I did it for ya top five
Nah I ain't care who the hot guy
Came with a hot line like way before Pac died
I’m over here while ya walk by
While I'm on point just like the tooth up in a shark bite
I push a rhyme like a fast car
And ran thru my bars like an alcoholic track star
So when you bragging all on who you are
Been there done that a t-shirt and a scar

[Hook: Derek Minor]
They see me shining and I'm popping
But I came from the darkness
They don’t know what I did to get up out of it
Well you should know about it, yo
Know what I’m trying to accomplish
But all they ever did was doubt it
But God got me through the nonsense
You should know about it

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Imagine me letting the comments move me
Imagine me letting the pressure from the game consume me
When I been on blocks where they all would shoot me
Yeah they got more bloods than a scary movie
Little so and so from the suburbs
Don’t try and rate what I’m doing with these nouns and verbs
Just giving you my life story over these words
Recollecting all the things that could’ve put me in the dirt
Yeah I got plaques on plaques with racks on racks on racks
But I would throw it all away for a convo with my Dad
And tell him I forgive him for the times that he ran
I finally understand what it takes to be a man
I just tell it like it is and let God do the rest
Don’t compare me to your favorite rapper he is not a threat
I'd-a quit a long time ago if this was for a check
I’m just trying to give life before I see my death .. it’s minor

[Hook: Derek Minor]
They see me shining and I'm popping
But I came from the darkness
They don’t know what I did to get up out of it
Well you should know about it
Know what I’m trying to accomplish
But all they ever did was doubt it
But God got me through the nonsense
You should know about it

[Verse 3: KJ-52]
You are the passenger see me just when I'm blasting it
I’m a hold the mic like a baby in a bassinet
I’m a hold the light kind of high I’m never passing it
Now because of Christ I'm resurrected like I'm Lazarus
I got them passionate rhymes for your mind kind of hazardous
See a man came from Nazareth that they labeled average
He was born with a star in the sky just like an asterisk
He took the chains from you and I boom then he shattered it
So sin is a labyrinth no hopes of getting out of it
So man can you fathom it it sounds quite elaborate
But there's a rope and a ladder to pull you out of it
Anyplace I can cope its no matter just how bad it get
We all shattered battered broken down and sick
Tattered heads ratted walk around like we out it
Yet my Lord is coming back just to grab his kids
And when He returns to the earth He’ll establish it

[Hook: Derek Minor]
They see me shining and I'm popping
But I came from the darkness
They don’t know what I did to get up out of it
Well you should know about it
Yo, Know what I’m trying to accomplish?
But all they ever did was doubt it
But God got me through the nonsense
You should know about it, yo
