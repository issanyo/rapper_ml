Chorus
Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up
Verse
Ridin' windows up cuz they won't roll down
Everybody lookin at me when I'm coming though your town
Both headlights out, muffler draggin on the ground
Got the speakers full blast, but you cannot hear a sound
Got my seat let back, so I'm ridin with a lean
And it smell brand new cuz I sprayed it with fabreeze
All the ladies flockin to me like some bees around some honey
Shawdy you can ride too if you got some gas money
Gotta check my mail box, nike socks and some flip flops
Pants on the ground, swagger comin through the rooftop
Terminally ill, flow sicker then a flu shot
Record labels blow my demos off cuz they too hot
But I ain't worried when they throw it in the trash
I be chillin on the porch, spittin raps about my cash
Got a sign out front, so you betta not trespass
Car broke down but I still got my bus pass

Chorus
Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up

Verse 2 (KJ52)
I'm on my rap dad swagger with a sippy cup
Muffler draggin station wagon with the windows up
Diapers saggin on my kids when I pick em up
My back seats covered all in chips and some cinnabons
Man I sit em up, tell my kids listen up
Sit down, buckle up, hush up, you jitter bugs
Take your Micky D's and hurry up and finish up
But they chuckin out they little cheese like some litter bugs
I never speed but I leave the peeps just in the dust
On some swagger wagon while I'm passin up your pickup truck
Playin doubble dragon why you all up in a rush?
Cuz I'm rollin window's up, but I never get no love
My AC broke, and I ain't fix it up
Man I'm crazy broke but I ain't ever given up
See I'm crazy rollin out and I'ma live it up
So even if the windows stack, I'ma just let it bum and...

Chorus
Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up

Verse 3 (A.R.Flexx)
Now any given day when it's raining
I hop up in the car and the system ain't bangin
Seats gettin wet so you know I'm bout to roll all my windows up
And they say there
Now it's hot up in the car and there's no AC
Paper towel in the back, get the sweat off me
If you wanna ride know the gas ain't free
So if you wanna ride better pay me, PAY ME!

Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up
Ridin' windows up
