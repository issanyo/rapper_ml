Featuring Pee-Wee

June 26th 1975
In Miami Florida was the place where I first arrived
My parents smiled as I opened up my blue eyes
Cuz they was newly married and I was just their first child
My pop was from Jersey my mom was from Miami
They met in Bed Stuy Brooklyn New York City
At art college and yep they was hippies
So I guess that just makes me a child of the sixties
But anyway we didn't stay we moved to Plant City
Then to Lakeland then to Tampa then to Ybor City
Living in the hood where things are never ever pretty
The only white kid smack dab in the inner city
My playground is a parking lot plus a back alley
At times I would wake up in the dark with no electricity
On top of that we struggling cause we got no money
And going through this inside it's killing me

Chorus
On and on
On and on
Your love goes (this is Behind the Musik)
On and on
On and on
(And I'm a take yall Behind the Musik)

I was about 6 when all this was going on
Things began to change everything I knew was up and gone
They separated on the weekends I would see my mom
Still living with my pops in the hood but not for too long
When I was nine they divorced and I was moving on
To the suburbs with mom cause the courts said it's wrong
For me to live with dad in the hood so I'm up and gone
Mom remarried had a baby we living in my grandma's home
We living in a neighborhood that's middle class
But I felt poor cause of some things that I didn't have
Time passed we moved out but things still ain't right
I'm slipping fast at home all I do is yell and fight
My grades start to crash plus I ran away twice
And almost got shot by the cops one single night
I started high school and I just party all the time
But little did I know what was gonna happen to my life

Chorus

At 15 I had a talk with my cousin got me thinking
Was there more to life than girls partying and drinking
I picked up his Bible and started reading Revelation
For some reason I was crying when I reached the ending
Now God was working on me and this was the beginning
The first time in long while when I started praying
I had to move again and say goodbye to everyone
My dad and my friends once again was all up and gone
Brand new school by myself sitting all alone
Feeling like a foot every single day I'm coming home
But I would listen every night in my bedroom
To gospel radio preach about Christ and just then soon
I gave my life to him everything became new
I was born again I've never been the same dude
Ya took my sin and my guilt and let them blame you
And on and on through the years you always came through

Chorus

It was November and the year was 1995
I still remember the very first date with my wife
And I was on my own doing shows part time
Twenty years old just trying to make something of my life
I moved away from home when I was only eighteen
Broke as a joke making music trying to chase the dream
And everybody seems to think I'm crazy except for me
But God was there every time to supply my needs
I went on staff at a church in the inner city
Writing rhymes in my spare time for my CD
I mailed a demo to a label called Gotee
And out of nowhere Todd Collins up and called me
He said he heard my junk and plus he wanted to sign me
My heart jumped and plus I wanted to cry and scream
But all I did was hung up the phone quietly
And thanked God how he always provided for me

Chorus
