[B-Section: Whosoever South]
Oh Lord take me down to the river
Oh Lord take me down to the river and make me whole

[Verse 1: KJ52]
I think of how many time I made a mess of me
When it's obvious You always had the recipe
For the best of me and now I guess I be
On my knees and I'm beggin now for less of me
When I see that everything is falling through
That's when I know that I need so much more of You
More peace, more love, and just more truth
Less of me more of Ya now in all I do
Got a whole lot of baggage that I'm sortin' through
That I'm dragging all around like it's portable
It's dragging me down I think it's horrible
Feeling lost but I'm found when I call to You

[B Section: Whosoever South]
Oh Lord take me down to the river and wash my soul
Oh Lord take me down to the river and make me whole

[Chorus:]
More of You less, of me
I need more of You
I need more of You, less of me
Give me more of You

[Verse 2: KJ52]
More of You and really so much less of me
I died to myself and said rest in peace
That's when I heard You say that You can rest in me
And I think about all the things that You're blessed to see
Like my wife and my kids and my family
The life that I live, I'm so glad I'm free
So when the rain falls, You are the canopy
That means whether I got it all or a can of peas
When I hit the wall You said "look to me"
I said every time I fall "I wish You took the lead"
But I'm learning slowly who I ought to be
Cuz if Your love is the ocean, wash over me

[B Section: Whosoever South]
Oh Lord take me down to the river and wash my soul
Oh Lord take me down to the river and make me whole

[Chorus:]
More of You, less of me
I need more of You
I need more of You, less of me
Give me more of You
