So in love with you

Now you were after me for so long
But I would walk by ignore you and roll on
Had all I needed just thinking I'm so strong
Just believing that nothing could go wrong
But never seeing just really what goes on
You'd start speaking I was like hold on
I'm just fiendinglike I could do no wrong
All that time i'm out cheating just all along
But looking back I was treating ya so wrong
I admit that it's seeming I chose wrong
But i've been meaning to change now for so long
And this is the reason I wrote just the whole song

You are all I ever need
You are my everything
You are my only thing
And the reason why I sing

Chorus

Just like that well everything changed
And I started looking at you in a whole different way
And its kind of strange but really i'm amazed
How you caught my eye and ya called my name
I'm the type of guy who thought he had it made
But I can't lie ain't nothing been the same
Since the time I changed and ya came my way
Reaaranged my whole space in such major ways
And to think i used to just take ya name in vain
But I'm so in love with you that I just won't contain
The way I feel I just can't explain
And this is the only way I can sum up what I'm saying

B Section

Chorus

Now we been together for a while now
And every day you find a way to make me smile now
So all I gotta say just every time now
I don't ever want to stray just any time now
I just want to know all your ways just every time now
And just for all my days I want to find out
That your love and your grace well it's all mine now
And this is all I can say in every rhyme now is that...

I can't get enough
So in love with you
This is what I want to do
Is be so in love with you
