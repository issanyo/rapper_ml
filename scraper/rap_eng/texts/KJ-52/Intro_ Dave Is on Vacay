[Intro]
'Go to Florida,' they said
'It'll be fun,' they said
I'm not havin' fun
There's nothin' fun about this
It's 90 degrees outside right now
It won't stop raining
These poor metal bugs tried to cart my wife off into the swamp
I'm not laughing
There's nothing fun about this
Zane, sit down
No, I don't care
Listen to me
I don't care
I don't-- I don't care
Just put some YouTube on or something
Just sit down guys
Listen to me, okay?
Just sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit--
This is the worst driving-- this is the worst traffic I have ever...
Why am I here?
Yes, yeah, I'd rather-- yes, I would
Please, just put some-- just put some Christmas music on
Just help me, anything
I don't care
I just can't take this, this, this drive anymore
These kids are-- I'm about to lose it
I'm gonna lose it
