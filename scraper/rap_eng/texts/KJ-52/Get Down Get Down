[Intro]
Here comes the get down get down
Here comes the get down get down
Here comes the get down get down

[Verse 1: KJ 52]
The one I serve is the most high
Pull up to the curb in my '05
Got the rims on tens when I roll by
No Benz but I got ten friends in an old ride
Walking in with a limp and a closed eye
Fanny pack and I'm strapped for the whole night
And the spots all packed and its so live
From the front to the back and its show time
Gonna hate play the wall for the whole night
Want beef? Get a burger and a cold fry
And a steak and a shake and a whole pie
You salty, I see that you throat dry
Two coffees I dance like an old guy
Can't stop cause I'm down for the whole nine
Like Rocky I punch till I go down
It's my party this how it goes out

[Chorus]
Here comes the get down get down
Why you wanna sit down sit down?
We come to get down get down
Junk that we bump so lit now

This the part where your mom gone dance
Hey mom, please don't dance

[Verse 2: KJ52]
One time I was up in the Sam's Club
Then a fan ran up put his hands up
Said he moved from Atlanta to Tampa
Whipped out a camera game me a pamper
Can you sign this quick for my grandma
Can I get a little pic for the fam-a
My nana is a fan of your grammar
He's doing duck lips while he's holding the camera
Your song is my number one jam-a
It's like I'm your number one fan-a
This is really so random
Can we be friends like Ross and Chandler?
You gifted kind of like Santa
You up there with the guy who sings Panda
Dc Talk my favorite band
Wait... What did you say?... Man what?

[Chorus]
Here comes the get down get down
Why you wanna sit down sit down?
We come to get down get down
Junk that we bump so lit now

This the part where your mom gone dance
Hey mom please don't dance

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I feel like I just don't fit in
And I feel like they just don't get it
And I feel like I'm just so different
When I rap for the cats who clap with no rhythm
Half pay attention, half didn't listen
Some wanna laugh at the fact that I'm a Christian
So when I state that I rap for a living
Some wanna hate for the sake of Religion
But my Saviour is risen
Back on a mission, back out the prison
Mouth is a motor, rap is the piston
Never gonna fail for your wack little system
But now I'm asking for wisdom
Just to deal with the cats that will listen
Still on a path that path of the vision
Back in the lab and I'm back in the kitchen
Like

[Chorus]
Here comes the get down get down
Why you wanna sit down sit down?
We come to get down get down
Junk that we bump so lit now

This the part where your mom gone dance

[Ending]
This the part where the song fade out
Song fade out
This the part where the song fades out
