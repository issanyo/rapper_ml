[Intro]
Wooooah oh oh
Woooahh oh oh
Shout it out it’s a brand new day

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
Your sun light is on my face
Your life is all I chase
I run right upon this race
Cause in you I’m gone put all my faith
Some nights I lose my way
Sometimes I walk and stray
But you come right inside my space
And each time you come you give me strength
This time I fix my gaze
This time it won't be the same
This time I won't be ashamed
So this time I can’t help but say that...

[Hook: KJ-52]
Wooooah oh oh
I'm starting over in a brand new way
Woooahh oh oh
Shout it out it’s a brand new day
And I’ll never ever ever ever be the same
No I’ll never ever ever ever be the same

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
Your sunlight is on my face
I look back how far I came
I think about how much I’ve changed
It was hard at times but I’m not the same
You deserve all this praise
You deserve all the fame
You deserve all my ways
I point back to you each and all my days
I reach and grab all you’ve gave
I see your hands all you’ve made
I see your plan and all you’d save
That we can have life (got me singing…)

[Hook: KJ-52]
Wooooah oh oh
I'm starting over in a brand new way
Woooahh oh oh
Shout it out it’s a brand new day
And I’ll never ever ever ever be the same
No I’ll never ever ever ever be the same
I'm starting over in a brand new way

[Bridge: Bethany Jones]
I’m not where I want to be
But I’m not where I used to be
(4x)

[Verse 3: Humble Tip]
Uh
Feelin' brand new
Word to my flesh [?]
Serving [?]
[?]
I'm a light in the dark c-candle
Not a scandal
That's [?]
Brand new and [?]
To say (Im not where I used to be)
I'll be brand new

[Hook: KJ-52]
Wooooah oh oh
Staring over in a brand new way
Woooahh oh oh
Shout it out it’s a brand new day
And I’ll never ever ever be the same
No I’ll never ever ever be the same
