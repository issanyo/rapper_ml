[Chorus:]
Starbucks takes all my money
Redbull takes all my money
Caffeine takes all my money
That junk ain't funny
Starbucks takes all my money
Redbull takes all my money
That junk ain't funny
Caffeine takes all my money

[Verse 1:]
Ooh wee my head is hurting
So early my eyes is burning
One thing I need that's working
Caffeine I need for certain
(what you gotta get) coffee purchase
Will I shake like I'm getting nervous
Grande that would be so perfect
Latte that's right you heard me
What you doing man hurry
Stop talking you too wordy
Now give me that junk then serve me
Fill it up with the stuff that I'm yearning
Now put it up in a cup then squirt it
With a pump of vanilla then serve it
What makes you the judge and jury
It's the 4th cup you think I'm worried

[Chorus:]
Starbucks takes all my money
Redbull takes all my money
Caffeine takes all my money
That junk ain't funny
Starbucks takes all my money
Redbull takes all my money
That junk ain't funny
Caffeine takes all my money

[Verse 2:]
They say that I'm a fiend yo
I drink 13 cappucino's
Handfuls of coffee beans so
Gonna pop em' with a frappucino
I don't know but it's time for the reload
So I head down to the street to the next road
Till I see that logo let's roll
Drink coffee till my head gone explode
Pull up like real slow
While I'm shaking and feeling a mess bro
Cause ya see I ain't like the rest folks
Kind of nuts without my espresso
My hearts pounding deep in the chest woah
They ground up the beans the best so
10 cups that means one thing though
I ain't gonna sleep let's roll!

[Chorus:]
Starbucks takes all my money
Redbull takes all my money
Caffeine takes all my money
That junk ain't funny
Starbucks takes all my money
Redbull takes all my money
That junk ain't funny
Caffeine takes all my money

[Verse 3:]
They say that I should chill
Right now well man I just feel
Heart running like I'm on a treadmill
All of sudden I don't want stand still
Why's it strange
Why's everyone kind of amazed
Haven't tried to sleep for 3 days
They think that my minds in a daze
Walk in and they kind of just gaze
They like KJ you okay?
Saw me rolling down the highway
Screaming out ok out of the way
Don't know man what I'm gone say
Don't worry man I think I'm ok
Starting now well I think I'm gone change
Who ordered Starbucks hey!

[Chorus:]
Starbucks takes all my money
Redbull takes all my money
Caffeine takes all my money
That junk ain't funny
Starbucks takes all my money
Redbull takes all my money
That junk ain't funny
Caffeine takes all my money
