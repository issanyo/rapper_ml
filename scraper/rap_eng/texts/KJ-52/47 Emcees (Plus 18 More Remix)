[Verse 1]
Let me bust a rhyme and tell a story like Slick Rick
And put a sermon like Eric in ya ear like a Q-Tip
It's common sense that Jah rules
But I'm a tell you about my Jesus who's the leader of the new school
You thinking you's cool you emcees is lost boys
Got no cash money you juvenile like some hot boys
I drop noise when I let the sound blast
And tell big boy Andre about Jesus Christ the outcast
What I feel it's time now just to be real
My Christ died on Calvary, not on Cypress Hill
You can be slim or you can be shady
Jehovah reigns supreme but his name ain't Jay-Z
And it's most def that the mob was deep
That hung the Son of Man who died just to bring back the lost sheep
On all streets all peeps naughty by nature
Whether you biggie or small, you can know the living Savior

[Verse 2]
Hey yo, Nate was my dog, my Westside connection
He had a crooked eye, plus he carried a Mac-10
He was corrupt in the game since back when
An alcoholic form the far side of Compton
But me and him we used to freestyle and fellowship
His DJ was quick with the beats when he's rocking it
And he would MC eight times a week just dropping it
Till the cops snooped my dog and put a stop to it
I said “life's a battle, we warning G”
And it really ain't easy, so e-mail me
And I'll break it down and just tell ya what ya need
I'd like to exhibit Christ as the one you should seek
You're on E! and the 40's ya drinking down
Is why you're coming up too short to make it now
I said you're my dog and then I gave him a pound
I once was lost like you but now I'm found

[Verse 3]
Let me take you back just to the old school
And tell you about the fresh prince of
Peace now he just cold rules
We keep it Nice and Smooth Rakim like Eric B
And Run “D” emcees to show my biz like its AG
See I'm down with 2 Live Crews full of Fat Boys
And even though we Young Emcees
We just can't avoid the one who Everlasts
Reigns as the lamb slain
Just for you and I Jesus went to the House of Pain
You can be the Black Sheep but Christ reigns supreme
Drink ya Ice T with some Vanilla Ice Cream
Don't matter to me, be the Public Enemy
He'll still make your sin disappear like he's Whodini
In this Biz I put his name on the Markie
That how I'm calling out these names when I emcee

[Verse 4]
Check it now, you can bounce with me
No Limit to my God like Master P
What audacity, it's quite Ludacris actually
To think you could Trick your Daddy
God the father sees everything naturally
You can't fool Him, I'm like whoa Nelly
He'll put the Bone Thugs back in Harmony
It ain't hard to see what he's done for me
I knew a guy named Bubba who'd Spark the place
He was Little like Wayne and had a Scarface
But now this cat done changed his ways
Talking how he's saved from amazing grace
Understand that Christ had to “C” Murder
You and I, we can live forever
East, South or the old school flavor
Y'all know just how I hit ya
