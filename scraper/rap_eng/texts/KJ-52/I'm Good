My alarm start going off at 545
I can barely open up my eyes hit the snooze a couple times
Hear my kids in the kitchen
Fix a bowl of cheerios 45 minutes till we hit the rood
Let the baby sleep until we about to leave
Change the diaper and put her in the car seat
Tell dayanna malachi leia jay
All i gotta say is daddy loves your more every day
Me and K got that rap dad swag
Mini van rap sound checking w/ a diaper bag
Cats be like “ain't you almost 40 now?”
How you still gonna call yourself the goldin child
With a wife a 3 bedroom house and 3 shorties now
But you know I’m still nice w/ that freestyle
Meanwhile still learning how to be a dad
Baby in my arms banging beats on them drum pads

When they ask me how Im living say “yeah im good”
And its only cause he risen k? “yeah Im good”
In case I forgot to mention well “yeah Im good”
Yeah you know I’m good I’m good
Might be going through my stress but “yeah Im good”
Every day I’m so blessed what “yeah Im good”
So i ain't worried about the rest cause “yeah Im good”
You know I’m good.. I’m good


Kj52:
My day starts at 6am when I clear the phelgm
I help my wife out the door cause she’s late again
Feet hit the floor grab the coffee pour it in
Out  the door to the car then I hop on in
I put the baby in the car seat help him in
Free styling w/ these old beats take a pen
Writing down the ideas when I walk on in
“ah its great to see you..” how you doing man
Drop him off hit the church then im rolling in
I read a little pray a little talk to God again
Im in the middle of a issue and i’m stressing it
But its really kind of little so I rest in Him
I found a calm right there to my restlessness
Plus I finally really know who my blessing is
And understand now just what he gives
It’s just another day in the life that i live
