The boy stepped out his house on to the sidewalk
Looked down the street on his block and then he just stopped
And tied the shoes on his feet and then he just walked
It was the middle of the week outside was real hot
He told his dad where he would be now and what not
Said he would go down by trees near the bus stop
The clock read quarter to three and he just thought I'll sneak around and play hide and seek in the back lot
And on his way to the spot a man from upstairs
Told him to stop and come here and he just stared
At this little boy of seven years with brown hair
And as he came near the man whispered in his ear
What he said left him numb frozen with fear
He wanted to run but his feet wouldn't go anywhere
He wanted to scream but he couldn't he was glued there
He wanted to leave but he wouldn't he was too scared

Cry no more
You don't have to cry no more
Don't cry no more
You don't have to cry no more

What happened that day left him changed forever
A day he wished he could erase and never remember
He tried to block out the pain as he got older
But he was consumed with hate now for this neighbor
And everyday he was ashamed when he saw himself
So ashamed that he proclaimed that he would never tell
Blocked out the memory of the pain so he'd never feel
He'd pretend to be okay and hide in his shell
He'd try to put a smile on his face like all was well
But this child couldn't change what he really felt
He blamed God for the cards that he was dealt
His heart grew hard by the time he was twelve
Began to fall apart and his grades start to fail
Until the day he cried to God asking for His help
He wanted to find and start a new life for himself
He closed his eyes and into the arms of Christ he fell

Cry no more
You don't have to cry no more
Don't cry no more
You don't have to cry no more

Everything you heard the boy would never speak
He held it all inside until he turned fifteen
I know that might be hard for you to believe
But he couldn't talk about it until God set me free
See way back when he was seven years old
He was sexually abused but no one was ever told
With nowhere to turn and no place to go
See he thought he could get through and maintain control
But little did he know he couldn't make it on his own
But that was just the time when you came through to show
How much You loved him and You wanted him to know
That You would never leave and You would never go
And You taught him to forgive and gave peace to his soul
And now he truly lives cause You made him whole
From that day ever since he ain't never been alone
That's why he'd convinced he don't have to cry no more

Cry no more
You don't have to cry no more
Don't cry no more
You don't have to cry no more
