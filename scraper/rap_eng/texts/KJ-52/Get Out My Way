[Intro]
Dear Lord
I don't want much for Christmas
I just don't want to shop anymore
That's pretty much it

[Verse 1]
Man, the mall’s so poppin' (Yuh)
Man, she won’t stop shoppin' (Nah)
Man, she won’t stop stoppin'
It's 5 in the mornin' and I can't stop yawnin' (*yawns*)
Why do we keep on walkin'? (Why?)
Why do we keep on talkin'? (Why?)
I feel like she got me locked in
Somebody call in the cops in (Whoop, whoop)
I cannot do this no mo’ (No)
I cannot walk in this sto' (No)
There was a kid at the do' (What?)
Seein' him eatin' his food off the flo' (Ah uh)
I'm gettin' disgusted for sho’ (Yeah)
Man, he pickin' his nose (What?!)
Wipin' the junk on his clothes (Come on!)
Nowhere can I go, I'ma lose it fo’ sure

[Hook]
Get out my way
Get out my way
Get out my way
Please, sir, get out my way
Get out my way
Get out my way
Hey, get out my way
Get out my way

[Chorus]
Why you wanna drive so bad, drive so bad?
Get out my way, uh
Why you wanna take my bag, take my bag?
Get out my way, yah
Y'all just make me mad, make me mad
Get out my way, please
What’s up with Dad? Unh
Get out my way

[Break]
Now listen, I, I don't want much out of life
I just don't want to shop anymore
An-and I also want Cinnabon
That'd be great

[Verse 2]
I cannot just remain calm (No)
I am so sick of this song (Yes)
Kids, where is ya mom? (Where is she?)
Kids, where is ya mom? (Unh)
Why is there cheese on your arm? (Why?)
Did you just sneeze in your palm? (Disgusting)
Why can’t you two get along? (Why?)
Why? Ah, Cinnabon (Yeah)
Siri, show me the car (Bloop, bloop)
I can not find it all (No)
I am so sick of this mall (Yuh)
I am so sick of you all, please pick up my call (Please)
I might sit in the hall (Maybe)
Maybe I’ll just talk to the wall (Hello? How you doin'?)
Take a nap on the floor (Okay)
This ain't shoppin', it’s war (War!)
