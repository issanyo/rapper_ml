[Verse 1]
Look at how far I come
I was living like on the run
I was living like for the fun
So lost 'fore I found the sun
Looking back at everything I done
You called and said to come
I saw and just thought to run
Right into the arms of the Only One

Yeah, we can't stop, won't stop
Riding down home tonight
Yeah, we can't stop, won't stop
Riding down home tonight

[Hook]
Right now tonight
We're giving everything to You
And our hearts, our souls, our lives
And every little thing we do
Tonight

[Verse 2]
I'm going on a whole new path
Out on a whole new chap'
Ain't nothing gonna hold me back
I've been through that, I won't come back
You're the only thing that lasts
You're the only thing I have
You gave me a whole new chance
To bring me back every time I crash
I give You everything I have
I give You everything I lack
I give you everything I can't
Sorta hope I found to stand

I can't stop, I won't stop
I don't stop, oh, no
I can't stop, I won't stop
I don't stop, I go

[Hook] (2x)

Tonight
We're giving everything
We're giving everything
