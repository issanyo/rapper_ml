[Intro]
Yo
Be like that, man to be like that
Be like that, I ain't stressin' man I'll be right back

[Verse 1]
Yo
First kick the rhyme flow way back in '94
You can't spell OG without the letters "G" "O"
Anywhere that He go, we go
See bro, lined up
Took a shot at it like a free throw
First name, Jonah
Last name, Sorrentino
"Dang, that sounds like a Jewish Gambino"
Nobody would gamble on the kid, its like Reno
Got my shot. But I fell backwards like Neo
"Yep we Know, that's just what you gotta face"
I was on the weak ends
You can call it Saturdays
Get it? Weekend
"Yeah, yeah"
Anyways
Kept on speaking with any tracks that I had to blaze
Without a database, I'm going that-aways
But I knew my Jesus not fame was what I had to chase
I'm glad to say that everyday He always had the way
Ain't a thing changed, 'xcept my age

[Chorus]
(Back in the day, what?)
It be like that
I ain't stressin' man, it be like that
It's a blessing when it be like that (See)
I'as knocked down but I be right back
I'm like "oh?! Yup, it be like that"
But I ain't stressin' when it be like that
Cause life's a blessin' when it be like that
I'm knocked down, but I be right back

[Verse 2]
I went from using tapes there just to run the track
To a world of soundcloud, played is the mumble rap
Ain't saying I hate this man
I'll just state the facts
You can stay the same, adapt or just fade to black
So all my days I remain just a humble cat
Blast through the lines like a psychopathic running back
Still got the hat low
Cross all up on my back!
Still let these cats know who He is and I ain't stopping that.  (nope)
Stop and Laugh
I see you come and go
Wrote the first rap stuck at  home with a busted nose
I let the words fly kinda like a busted hose
Dropped a boulder on the crowd
Crushed the show!

[Pre-Chorus]
Man I love it Bro
I got the greatest job
Still one love, one God that I'm bustin' on
You need to catch up man
You got the mustered sauce
He remains the same even when they goin' claim I'm gone. (right)

[Chorus]
(Back in the day, what?)
It be like that
I ain't stressin' man, it be like that
It's a blessing when it be like that
Man?
I was knocked down, but I be right back
I'm like "oh?! Yup, It be like that."
But I ain't stressin' when it be like that
Cause life's a blessin' when it be like that
Knocked down but I be right back
