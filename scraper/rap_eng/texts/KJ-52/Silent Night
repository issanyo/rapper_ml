[Intro: Madeline Gibbs]
Silent night, holy night

[Chorus: Madeline Gibbs]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
Yo, Mary was a teenager, Joseph a little older
It wasn’t December but it got a little colder
And they was in that spot where she got to hold Ya
Just on the run, just from the hunt of these Roman soldiers
In a feedin' trough is where they got to hold Him
It's just a feedin' spot there just to hold You over
One day for thirty coins, well, they went and sold ya
Then threw You in a cave right there where they’d roll a boulder
No Christmas lights and no Christmas tree
But there was life and there was light up in the Peace of Prince
And they would call Him Christ, call Him King o' Kings
Born of a virgin birth, that was the mystery
He took our misery and came to get us free
He was that gift indeed wrapped up for all to see
Follow the star right there to where He slept in peace
To see this baby boy, this little refugee

[Chorus: Madeline Gibbs]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
Ah, it was a silent night but they was blessed to speak
And talk about the Light, the One that came to be
The Way and Truth and Life, the only One that we need
He was born just for this reason now for you and me
They headed west to y'all, they named You Yeshua
That means the Lord will save, yeah, yes, You are
The Bright and Mornin' Star, we've all fallen short
Of Your glory in this story, we are not up to par
They had come so far and now we're blessed to call
On the Name above all names, that's the best of all
And from the worst right there to the best of y'all
You were the net that was spread just to catch our fall
Took all we did, removed this mess of ours
So that no one would miss the grace o' God
You took the debt then erased it all
On the silent night, so to You we call

[Chorus: Madeline Gibbs]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright

[Outro: Madeline Gibbs]
Round yon’ virgin mother and child
Holy infant, so tender and mild
Sleep in Heavenly peace
Sleep in Heavenly peace
