Daddy why did u do that to mommy?
You said if we hit somebody we're suppose to say sorry
But you never say sorry daddy you yell now
Why did you tell that man that mommy just fell down
Mommy didn't fall down daddy's lying
Mommy why are you always sad and always crying?
Daddy why are you always mad you always fighting?
Why do you always say im bad even when im trying?
No i dont want to go to my room
I dont want to go to bed now i want to be with you
I dont want to daddy it's to early
I didn't mean it daddy im sorry im sorry
I promise i'll never say that again
Im sorry daddy please dont hit me again
Please i'll be a good boy now
Dont put me in the room please dont turn the lights out
(what did i do?
Im sorry daddy that's all i want to say to you)
CHORUS
Where?where were you? just when i needed you
Daddy where were you
Where?where were you?just when i needed you
Mommy where were you
(golden child)
What up pops i ain't got to tell you my heart is as hard
As a rock things have changed since i was the age six
Yet some situations stay the same like the way
I conceal my pain growing up i'd swear
My name was every profane thing a man could say
I used to make excuses like you werent the one that hit her
It was just the liquor in ya my dad
The perfect example of hatred and why am i so bitter?
Ya told me real men dont cry that was a lie
You dont relize what goes on inside of my mind
As time passed my heart ran cold my emotions froze
Lost track of the bruises and the broken bones
Just once wanted to hear that you loved me
Wrap your arms around me and hug me yeah right
Remember the first time i couldn't feel the pain
It was when grandma came and took me to church
Where God releived the hurt and he knows it took work
But i forgave you he could save you but the question in
Will you let him in it would be such a blessing
To see you as a changed man and holdin my mothers hand
CHORUS
