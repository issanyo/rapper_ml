Whoa, got me singing
Whoa, shout it out, it's a brand new day

Your sunlight is on my face
Your life is all I chase
I run right upon this race
'Cause in You I'm gon' put all my faith

Some nights I lose my way
Sometimes I walk and stray
But You come right inside my space
And each time You come by, you give me strength

This time I fix my case
This time it won't be the same
This time I won't be chased
This time I can't help but say that

Whoa, I'm starting over in a brand new way
Whoa, shout it out, it's a brand new day

Now I'll never, ever, ever be the same
Now I'll never, ever, ever be the same

Your sunlight is on my face
I look back how far I came
I think about how much I've changed
It was hard at times but I'm not the same

You deserve all this praise
You deserve all the fame
You deserve all my ways
I point back to You each and all my days

I reach and grab all You've gave
I see your hands and all You've made
I see your plan and all You'd save
That we can have life

Got me singing
Whoa, I'm starting over in a brand new way
Got me singing
Whoa, shout it out, it's a brand new day

Now I'll never, ever, ever be the same
Now I'll never, ever, ever be the same
Now I'll never, ever, ever be the same
Now I'll never, ever, ever be the same

I'm not where I want to be
But I'm not where I used to be
I'm not where I want to be
But I'm not where I used to be

I'm not where I want to be
But I'm not where I used to be
I'm not where I want to be
But I'm not where I used to be

I'm not where I used to be
I'm not where I used to be
I'm not where I used to be

Got me singing
Whoa, I'm starting over in a brand new way
Got me singing
Whoa, shout it out, it's a brand new day

Now I'll never, ever, ever be the same
'Cause I'll never, ever, ever, it's a brand new day
Now I'll never, ever, ever be the same
'Cause I'll never, ever, ever, it's a brand new day

Shout it out
Sunlight is on my face
Shout it out
It's a brand new day

Shout it out
Think about how much I've changed
Shout it out
And you deserve all the fame

Shout it out
Point back to you each and all my days
Shout it out
That we can have life
That we can have life
That we can have life
Shout it out
