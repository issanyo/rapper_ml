[Intro: KJ-52]
Crucify Him, crucify Him
No, no, no, no!
Crucify Him, crucify Him
Please say no!
Crucify Him, crucify Him
Hold up
Crucify Him, crucify Him!
He's innocent, what are you doing?!
Crucify Him, crucify Him!
Can't you see that He's innocent?
Crucify Him, crucify Him, crucify Him!
He's, He's innocent

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
What if?
What if?
What if?
What if?
What if?
Ay yo
What if you was transported in time
To the place and the spot where Christ had to die
What if you beheld with you own two eyes
Where His blood was spilled
Where He gave His life
When He came up to Heaven He was barely alive
Could you, tell who He was if He walked on by
Could you, see what they done to His back and His sides
Would you, see all His love
Would you, recognize when they
Pierced His scull with the thorns
And they tried to, pull out His hair out His beard
Then decided to, pierce His bare back 39 times
You, get the real facts, they're right there beside you
What if you saw Him die?
Got a real view
Would you keep living the life the way that you do?
Or would you run and hide?
Just continue to, live your life blind
It's up to you dude

[Hook: KJ-52]
Will you ever know?
Will you ever see?
What He's done for you
What He's done for me
Can you ever know?
Can you ever see?
What will it take, for you to believe?
(x2)

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
What if today was the very day He died
And, what if you was standin' right there by His side
As the, people cheered, and they screamed, and they cried
But this time around see was He crucified
What if He was lead from a jail this time to be
Executed in the middle of the night
But, you can view, tune it in worldwide
On the Internet, on the TV, was televised
What if you was standin' right there
Brought Him on done to the electric chair
And you had to flip the switch
Now would you be aware?
Would you understand His death?
Would you, even care?
Would you, changed how you lived?
Would you shed a tear?
Would you, see what He did?
Would you, be prepared to
Give your life to Him, right now and right there?
Can you see what He did?
It's quite clear

[Hook]

[Verse 3: KJ-52]
You held the very nails used to
Hold Him on the cross then
What would you do?
You saw Him beat up, beat down, then abused
Would you, see how much it cost for Him, now for you
But, what would it take for Him to prove
That He, took the blame for everything that we do
It's still, just the same, man there ain't nothin' new
They still, hate to change and come down to you
But, what if you could gaze and just see
The last 5 minutes before He would leave
This Earth and worst
What if you, saw Him breathe His last breath
When death, took His life
You see His head hang down
He starts to heave
Cause His, death came slow, it's plain to see
That it's more painful than we could imagine it to be
Now you seen the plain view, do you believe?

[Hook]
