[Verse 1]
Yo! This is what happened
Yo! I woke up late it was like 10 in the mornin
I was still half asleep and sleepy eyed, still yawnin'
I checked my voice mail to see who'd been callin
I turned on my computer
Checked my email logged on it
Junk mail, junk mail dog-on-it
Everybody just tryin to sell me they product
But there was one email that cought my optic
It said suicidal, took the mouse and clicked onit
She said, "Dear KJ, you don't know who I am
You probably don't care 'cause I'm just another fan
I doubt you ever read this, now but if you can
Sometimes I slash my wrists and even cut my hands
And I feel all alone like nobody understands
And I'm gonna end it tonight I got the whole thing planned
Pop pills, leave a note on my night stand
Signed sincerly, Your Number One Fan

[Chorus]
Can someone now please help me?
Will someone now just please help me?
Can someone now please help me?
Will someone now just please help me?

[Verse 2]
My heart is poundin' as I start to type back
"Why do you feel this way, do you mind if I ask?
What's the source n' causin' the pain that ya have?
How'd you get this way, is it somethin' from the past?
God cares about you, hope you understand that
Please don't end your life, I'm beggin', please write back!"
I finished typing, I sent the email quite fast
I bowed my head and prayed with the strength that I had
She said, "Man, KJ, I didn't even know you'd write me
Let me explain why no one could ever like me
It all started when my father used to strike me
Rape and abuse since 1990
He's gone now but I can't put it all behind me
I tried to run away, but my trouble'll always find me
Is God really just the one that can help me?
Signed now, your number 1 fan sincerely"

[Chorus]
Can someone now please help me?
Will someone now just please help me?
Can someone now please help me?
Will someone now just please help me?
