I’m on a lonely walk trying to be Tony Hawk
Skating past the little spot where my homie fought
Ask my parents for the sneaks that my homie got
But we barely speak at all I ain't home a lot
Cuz every hour every week I just rode the block
Little skate rat got a dollar in my only sock
Skate back to store for a soda pop
I’m in the  mall food court with my friends a lot
Sneaking out at night sometimes we getting caught
Speeding on my bike like up and down the block
I call this girl I like I think she kind of hot
But will she call me back that’s my only thought
Wrong place wrong time almost got me shot
By a cop rolling by at the dealer shop
But I skate away I’m never getting caught
Watch it fade to grey and this I thought

I was on my grind grind grind grind grind
You can find me all the time time time time time

Goldin child:
Cats went from skate or die to skateboarding ain't a crime
Even though sometimes crime and skateboard coincide
I was on that 180 heel flip to a backside tail slide
Better stick the landing right
Around that time the scene went from punk rock to hip hop
Started spitting rhymes in the skate shop
Felt like i was in the midst of a renaissance
When culture collide and give birth to a new time
Back then i was blind chasing girls
Had a split from the world industry
Flip mentalities got real spit fire for the king
The original vision Christ was never plan b
Life changed when a switch stance kick flip to rail slide
Broken growth plate shattered tail bone
Put my board away started picking up a microphone
Since that day you could say i was on my…

I used to kick flip to grind now I kick flip the rhyme
Got  mind on my money and the money on my mind
But my money is a dime and that ain't helping me to shine
Contemplating crime just to help me get by
But I can’t see the time and I can’t seem to find
A little peace of mind and I can’t seem to climb
Out the route and I doubt that I’ll ever see a sign
That will help me get out of this mess now of mine
But I’m lost until the cross came in to shine
In came divine light to invade the blind
In came in the time that my life hit rewind
And it’s only cause Christ that I came in the vine
Came into find a whole change in design
He gave is mine and he came to find
Me when I was lost and I can’t wait to fly
Him in the sky but until that time..
