Ooh ahh push em high

Now i was just walking through cartoon land
When all of a sudden i ran into sponge bob square pants
He was chilling with the power puff girls and spiderman
Driving down sesame street with scooby doo in a mini van
He was rocking to the beat driving as fast as they can
They almost ran over ren and stimpy and he man
I yelled at them slow down but they didn't understand
They said they heading over to a free hip hop jam
Over in the park let me catch a ride then
I got in picked up bart simpson kept driving
Got to the spot and the party was live and
At the open mic contest bevis and butthead was rhyming
I was like them kids is wack give me just a try and
Waited patiently till it was just my time and
I told the crowd make noise get ya hands high and
This is what i said when i grabbed on the mic i told em...

Chorus

Said to the crowd "my name's KJ-52"
And i came to get down i got something to say to you
Understand what i mean even if you're a cartoon
Jesus reigns supreme that's how my team comes through
And then all of a sudden these wannabe hard dudes
From south park walk up just talking smack too
And the smurfs backed them up i guess they was just a crew
And said let's battle fool i said check it out duke
Your five inch tall plus ya crew is all blue
I'd probably step on ya'll if i just bettled you
They said la la la la....
That's all you ever say dude
Just right then just the crowd started to boo
Them right off the stage but i knew just what to do
I told d.j. voltron just on the ones and two's
Man kick the beat check it out this is how im rocking your

Chorus

Well the crowd started cheering the party was slamming
The thundercats and pokemon they was break dancing
The transformers hopped in and started pop locking
With g.i. joe and johnny bravo chilling and just watching
I just stayed on the mic and kept the speakers knocking
Letting them know that christ was the reason that i'm dropping
I could go on all night and jsut keep on talking
But just right then power rangers started walking
Up on the stage and said i won the open mic and
As i reached to get my trophy and just claim my prize and
Well out of nowhere well this is what happened

Chorus
