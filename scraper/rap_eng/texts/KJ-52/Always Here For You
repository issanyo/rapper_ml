To my unborn son this is for ya
This song that I've done it comes straight from your father
It's 2006 I've never saw ya
But I'm wondering what your gonna look like and what I'll call ya
Will you be like me or like your mother
Will you one day have another sister or a brother
The one thing that I know is that I'm gonna love ya
Can wait to pick you up kiss you and hug ya
A little scared just to be called a daddy
I wanna give you everything that I was never having
I want to make sure no thing you're ever lacking
I want you to know that no matter what happens
I'm a love you and you can count on
Anything you go through you can be strong
All you gotta do is trust Him and that's all
And I'll be right here for you to if you just call

Daddy's always here for you
Daddy's always here for you
In anything that you go through
Just remember I love you

Right now I promise that me and your mother
Will never split up we gone always stay together
Don't want you to doubt and never wonder
'Cause we built this house on Christ and none other
At bedtime we'll gone pray for each other
Then I'll tuck you in at night and pull up the covers
Tell you sleep tight and that's when your mother

Will turn off the light we gone tell you we love ya
I'll watch you learn your ABC's and your numbers
Can't wait to see all the things you'll discover
Fall turns to winter winter turns to summer
You'll grow so fast and so big then I'll wonder
How did time go by and then I'll tell ya
About this song that I wrote and then I'll show ya
What I was thinking of you just when I wrote ya
Cause I wish the best for you and this is what I told ya

I got the good news it's like yesterday
In nine months you're gonna be on your way
I didn't know what to do or really what to say
See all I knew was to give thanks and pray
I feel nervous though about everything
I keep wondering what's gonna be your name
I'm gonna be a dad it's all gonna change
But I'm glad for the blessing God has gave
You'll be born soon sometime right around in May
The year 2007 will never be the same
Me and your mom we gone look back upon this day
Pull out this song and think about when you came
It won't be long now you see I can't wait
To hold you in my arms see your hands and face
Keep you safe from harm and what comes your way
Cause Daddy loves you and that will never change

Daddy's gonna love you no matter what you go through
Mommy's gonna love you no matter what you go through
