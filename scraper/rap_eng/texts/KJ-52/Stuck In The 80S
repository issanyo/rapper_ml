[Chorus:]
I think I'm stuck in the 80's
I think I'm stuck in the 80's
Shout outs to all the fellas and the ladies

I'm like woah man this ain't what I planned
To get everyone to stare at me man
I walked in with the parachute pants
Checkerboards on a pair of new Vans
It's kind of embarrassing man
I think I'm gonna just scare a few fans
They trying to take care of me then
Cause the 80's are over so where have I been
You should know where I be
With Atari just on the TV
And a boom box tape deck no cd
With the acid washed jeans ripped in the knee like what?
Well you should know what I mean
When the t-shirt is pink and lime green
It glows and it shows as bright as high beams
It's like back to the future one nine eight three let's go...

[Chorus:]
I think I'm stuck in the 80's
I think I'm stuck in the 80's
Shout outs to all the fellas and the ladies

I'm like c'mon man how can you dismiss this
I got a beeper as thick as my wrist is
I got a cell phone on the wish list
About as big and as tall as ya rims is
You might think we some misfits
My girl's hair shoots up 26 inch
In the air and you's up in my business
But I don't care cause you'll just never get this
So for instance when I rock spots
I keep it old school with a swatch watch
Now I'm a grown dude but I still got
The hammer pants when I dance it's still hot
So I roll through man it's so tight
My whole click dressed like Miami Vice
Listen close dude see what I'm gone write
It's like back to the future and it goes like

[Chorus:]
I think I'm stuck in the 80's
I think I'm stuck in the 80's
Shout outs to all the fellas and the ladies

Now I'm a be the coolest dude
Even if I roll around with a rubiks cube
Or maybe I'm the hugest fool
For trying to get down and make the 80's cool
But it's so true I was a crazy kid
If you knew all the shady ways I lived
You'd be amazed but today I'm His
God's grace now covered all them thangs I did
So take it back to the future
And take a day off like Ferris Bueller
Back when Micheal jack was the ruler
When apple Mac had the fastest computer
I'm a school ya with my new song
About the facts of life like the sitcom
But the facts with Christ that you'll live on
It's like back to the future and I'm a get gone

[Chorus:]
I think I'm stuck in the 80's
I think I'm stuck in the 80's
Shout outs to all the fellas and the ladies
