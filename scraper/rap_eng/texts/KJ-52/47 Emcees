[Verse 1]
Let me bust a rhyme tell a story like Slick Rick
And put a sermon like Erick in your ear like a Q-Tip
Now it's common sense that Jah rules
But I'm a tell you about Jesus, who's the leader of the new school

[Verse 2]
You thinking you's cool you emcees is lost boys
Got no cash money you juvenile like some hot boys
I drop noise when I let the sound blast
And tell Big Boy Andre about Jesus Christ the outcast
Here's the deal I feel it's now time to be real
Christ died on Calvary not on Cypress Hill

[Verse 3]
It don't matter even if you're slim or if you're shady
Jay-Hova reigns supreme but his name ain't Jay-Z
And it's most def' that the mob was deep
That hung the Son of Man who died just to bring back the lost sheep
On all streets all peeps naughty by nature
Whether you biggie or small you can know the living Savior now

[Verse 4]
Let me take you back to the old school
And tell you about the fresh prince of peace now who just cold rules
We keep it nice and smooth Rakim like Eric B
And run dee Emcees to show our biz like AG
See I'm down with two live crews full of fat boys
And even though we young emcees now we can't avoid
The one who ever lasts reigns as the Lamb slain
Just for you and I Jesus went to the house of pain

[Verse 5]
You can be the black sheep but Christ reigns supreme
Drink ya ice tea with some vanilla ice cream
Don't matter to me be the public enemy
He'll still make your sin disappear like he's Houdini
In this biz I put his name on the marquee
That's why I'm calling out these names when I emcee

[Verse 6]
Check it now you can bounce with me
No limit to my God like Master P
What audacity it's quite ludicrous actually
To think you could trick your daddy
God the Father sees everything naturally
You can't fool Him I'm like whoa nelly
He'll put bone thugs back in harmony
It ain't hard to see just what He's done for me

[Verse 7]
I knew a guy named Bubba who'd spark the place
He was little like Wayne and had a scar face
But now this cat done changed his ways
Talking how he's saved from amazing grace
Understand that Christ had to see murder
So you and I when we die live forever
East south or old school flavor
47 emcees is how I hit ya
