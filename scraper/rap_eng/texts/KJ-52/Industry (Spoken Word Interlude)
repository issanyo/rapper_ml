[Spoken Interlude: KJ-52]
Do you remember the time, when the purpose and the rhyme, was to see the souls affected
But now its to man, every purpose and every plan, to whom the praise is directed
We live out dream, make the crowd scream, but turn to yell at the sound man
Since where and when did we stop checking the word and begin to start checking the sound scan
Remember when shows were for souls and rhymes were for flows
Now we spend one minute to pray, if even that for each day, but spend 2 hours checkin our clothes
What happened to the passion we was having that was sparked in the begining
But we're quick to cry, point the speck in your eye, but even quicker to justify our sinning
We're wuick to diss and raise the fist to justify the things that we do
But for every finger we point at them, just remember freind there's 4 more pointin back at you
How and when did it all begin as ministry turned to industry
Cause did jesus need a manager, record label, ditributor, or even a boooking agency
When troubles came, did he call upon the name, or turn to a lawyer to handle it
Why do we ask God last, ignore the past, but be the first to ask our management
Cause next to him, our glory's dim and truely pales in comparison
Why does every move we choose seem to revolve around
We can get our groove on, but yet worry about comin on to strong
Yet we water it down so much there ain't even nothing left to chew on
Souls become sales, and sales become a salary
Give the crowd something to feel, whine about keepin it real
But dont try to keep it to reality
Yet when its all over and the mic is hung and its all said and done
It won't matter how many battles i
