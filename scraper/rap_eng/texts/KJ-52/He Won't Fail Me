Something or nothing (yeah)
From nothing to something (yeah)
And I ain't just bluffing or fronting man
Hit me like all of a sudden
And I was just grinding and hustling
Hoping that something was coming (yeah)
Going just wide and I'm bugging it
I'm trusting Your coming
Two jobs that I'm juggling coping and hoping
That something was bubbling (nah)
But I started with nothing man
All of my life I was struggling fumbling
But I saw that juice coming it I saw that juice coming it
Now I got the upper hand I got the upper hand
You know that I'm loving it ever since I found You
You had this a better plan

Zealot gang I pray to God I started a movement
He won't fail me He never fails like a A student
Put Him first on the fast track
And the devil never gets the last laugh
God taught me God's got me
And He's got my back like a backpack
Through all my tools I'ma give Him my future
Left that in His image if that isn't His plan then we blew it
People may hate me and want me to screw up
But I'm with the zealots you know how we do it
God will never leave our side make a move so now we moving
Kill religion find relationship yeah I am living revolution

I was just down on the floor
That's when You arrived at my door
Grabbing a hold of myself
I know You was just making me whole
Yeah the world is just taking it's toll
Yeah but You just making me grow
Uh plus you just paving the road
When I'm taking it slow but I say it's more
And You changing the globe just like I changed up the flow
This is the reason I go this is the reason I'm broke
For the team the test on my soul I say
