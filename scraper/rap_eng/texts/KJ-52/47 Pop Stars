[Intro]
Hey, yo
As if 47 emcees wasn't enough, I got 47 pop stars, rock stars coming at you
Yo, count them
Here we go

[Hook]
Just do it
Just do it do it do it
Just do it rock to it
Put ya hands up high and move it

[Verse 1]
Sometimes i flow weird throw verbal spears like Britney
That literally go from here to Houston just like Whitney
Battle me man you kidding me you just a funny cat
I bet you 50 cents to M&Ms you won't get a nickel back
The track I'm ripping that cause it really ain't that hard
See Jesus gives destiny to every child of God
I'm battle scarred kind of raw but what did you think?
No matter race religion or the color or the creed.
If ya black brown or pink or in or out of sync
Or hang with the beastie boys that's on the back street
You can live in Lincoln Park it don't matter just to me
See the prince of peace is guaranteed to give you what you need

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
One day these peeps they was going past me
Walking with a limp eating biscuits and their hair was shaggy
I said "What's y'alls name? That's the question that I'm asking."
"I'm Michael, that Celine, that's Dion, that's Jackson
Rickey and Martin that's Tony and Braxton
Drew is on the hill he just chilling and relaxing
Alicia lost her keys and shes really kind of sad." and
I said, "You too? No doubt i know how that be happening
But i need all the Dixie chicks to gather in
And let me just explain now the reason I'm rappening."
So i told mariah he carried my sin and died for me
My faith is in Christ, who on a hill called calvary
Gave his life for mine so genuine i try to be
If the world tries to stop me I rage against the machine
So i turn ya radio up and head to the spot
Get loose like a slipknot, watch the kid rock

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3]
My uncle was eating corn on a cracker all alone
It was 98 degrees out and he was counting crows
And it was just then my papa now he just saw a roach
He dropped his red hot chili peppers and then he ran home
And just went they called up John the mayor on the phone
"It's a 311, 3 doors down. Now don't be slow!"
But he was like wait a second hold a minute bro
Before I usher on over now there's something you should know
Jesus is the firm rock not a rolling stone
With him heaven, not nirvana is where you'll go
And I try to show and let ya know but ya third eye is blind
You need to just open them up just real wide
And even if you have to blink 182 times
It's just so obvious that it can't hide
TLC tender loving care now he'll provide
From girls to boys to men they need to let him inside

[Hook] x2
