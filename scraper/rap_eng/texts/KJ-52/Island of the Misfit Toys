Welcome to the island of the misfit toys (x3)
Yeah
Land of the broken girls and boys

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
I'm sittin' in detention feeling like the breakfast club
Staring at my desk wishing that I had a hug
I wouldn't pay attention but what I paid for love
But when you're searching for some hope, man, that junks a drug
Awkward, introvert, really had nowhere to turn
Crumbling, insecure, struggling with the hurt
Stomach all up in a churn rumbling up in my shirt
Wishing that I had a girl but all I ever get is burned
They say nerds gotta wait they turn
And I'm heartsick while I'm living in a dream deferred
My heart gripped in pain
Mouth full of curse words
I can't get away until I read the first verse
Of Your word, then I learned of my birth curse
And that You died for me, and all my net worth
I realized my need just to make a second birth
I bowed my knee and said take away the hurt

[Bridge: KJ-52]

[Verse 2: Marty]
Goes out to you, brother
Yeah, I know I got a bad reputation
Walk around, always mad reputation
Make a pretty girl, sad reputation
Probably should be dead reputation
But life moves fast, and if you blink, you gon' miss it
Miss the pain in the voice if you don't listen
Sittin' by myself at the lunch table
Wishing that I had some real friends but I knew that I didn't
I try to do my best, I don't fit in
I realize now, I'm a misfit
But what would you do in my position
When it all falls down and you're the one that it's hittin'

[Verse 3: FERN]
From a place so vulnerable where I'm coming from
About to break down I'm feeling so overdone
Lost my young boy, but joy showed up in the morning
And all of a sudden my burdens just weren't important
Got to live life, fly high where the eagles are
And me out here pointing where the steeples are
Yeah, been overlooked wishing they would notice you
Doing everything in your power to get a hold of you
Rejected by the world accepted by the Lord puttin' numbers on the board
And we're misfits 'til it's finished
And I love you and hope you get to hear this

[Bridge 3: Marty, FERN & KJ-52]
This is for the cutters

Lovers
Thugs
Block huggers
Killers
Stuck up in the prison
Listen
Don't you forget
You are loved
You are loved
You are loved
