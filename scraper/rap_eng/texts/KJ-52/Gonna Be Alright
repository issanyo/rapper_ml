I want to thank you Lord, just to be alive, just to be alive

Chorus
When I woke up this morning
I started thinking everything was alright
It's gonna be alright
Be alright
It's gonna be alright

Now last night I was just a mess
All depressed and I couldn't rest cause now I'm full of stress
You wouldn't guess if ya seen me cause I'm looking blessed
But look inside my mind you'll find it full of unhappiness
Now when ya wander in the wilderness
It's even harder just to follow the Father now I must confess
But see I been through the rest and I been through my test
And I been convinced that it's gonna make some sense
But nonetheless see I wonder when I'll finish this
But it's your love and grace that's unlimitless
And ya promises it makes me just hold to this
It's gonna be alright when I wake up see I'm knowing this

Chorus

Now last night I was just a mess
But see this morning when I woke up yawning my stress had up and left
Threw on the clothes took a shower and I'm feeling fresh
Feet on the floor step out the door and I'll bounce and jet
There ain't nothing like the feeling that ya tend to get
When you been through the storm and ya know it's over with
And you was holding on but now you know you over it
And now you going strong and plus you made the most of it
This is a song with a reason for composing it
Cause when things go wrong you gotta just hold to this
No matter what be going on see I been told of this
With the break of dawn it'll be alright I'm knowing this

Chorus

I want to thank you Lord, just to be alive, just to be alive

Chorus
