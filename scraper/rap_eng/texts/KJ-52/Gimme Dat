We have a new member today, his name's KJ-52
KJ introduce yourself
KJ-52:
My name is KJ-52 and I'm addicted to Mountain Dew
Director:
Tell the people a little about what happened

KJ-52
What am I gonna do, I'm addicted to Mountain Dew
When I drink just one or two
People say "Boy what's wrong with you man"
Start acting like a fool, from all the caffeine and sugar too
I'm fiending like I ain't got a clue
And this is what I'm gonna say to you

CHORUS:
Uhh...Gimme that Mountain Dew
Uhh...Gimme that Mountain Dew
Uhh...Gimme that Mountain Dew
I ain't playing with you better gimme that Mountain Dew

Director:
Well, KJ I know that must be tough to talk about
But part of recovery is talking about it starts
Explain how this started

KJ-52:
I started when i was on tour
I had to stay awak so I went to the store
Loaded up and I buth like four, I just kept drinking more and more
When all of a sudden something happened to me
Just for some reason I couldn't fall asleep
Mabe it was all the sugar and the caffeine
Not sure but I started to scream...

CHORUS

Director:
Well, KJ I know that was painful to talk about
But you CAN overcome it
You just have to admit that you have a problem

KJ-52:
I got a problem I jsut can't help it
Somebody help I think I'm addicted
Cause every day i just got to have it
I can't help it, it's just a habit
I got a problem, I get it
I'm an addict, I'll admit it
And I promise I'm gonna quit it
Hey that mountain Dew over there, anybody gonna finish it...?

Director:
KJ, you need to put the Mountain Dew down
KJ, back away from the Mountain Dew
KJ-52 BACK AWAY FROM THE MOUNTAIN DEW
NOW MAN, I AIN'T PLAYING WITH YOU!

CHORUS
(Arguing in the background)

KJ-52:
Sorry, I don't know what came over me
Director:
Sorry
KJ-52:
You didn't have to hit me
