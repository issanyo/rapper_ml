Check one two, this song right here is dedicated to all the soccor moms all arcoss the world
Can i get more cow bell on this (cow bell)
I'm a plain white rapper in a minivan
Just a plain white rapper in a minivan
Just a plain white rapper in a minivan
And I'm sittin on 20's (you're a liar)
Okay their really 18's but I keep them clean

I've got a red minivan from 1996
The window's broke and you know I won't ever get it fixed (which is pretty pathetic, actually)
I'm bumpin' Veggie Tales I ain't even got any kids (Yeah, so what? I listen to Veggie Tales, so what?)
People think I'm nuts but I just told them this

I'm a plain white rapper in a minivan
Just a plain white rapper in a minivan
Just a plain white rapper in a minivan
And I'm sittin on 20 inch rims (oookay..)
Okay their really 16's but I keep them clean

To all the soccer moms taking their kids to karate
Keep sippin' on your mochachokafrokamochachoka latties (soy lo carb lo fat lo chi....starbucks)
This song is dedicated to you and everybody (Tweezy got love for the soccer moms)
So put your hands up right now if you really wanna party

I'm a plain white rapper in a minivan
Just a plain white rapper in a minivan
Just a plain white rapper in a minivan
And I'm sittin on 20 inch rims (stop lying)
Okay their really 14's but I keep them clean

Once upon a time a turtle hit my car on interstate 75 (this is a true story)
And the poor little turtle crawled off of the road and he died (single teardrop)
I stood there on the roadside and I wanted to cry(poor little turtle)
Except for the fact that the stinkin' turtle made my engine overheat and the car almost fried (and itcost me $300)

I'm a plain white rapper in a minivan
Just a plain white rapper in a minivan
Just a plain white rapper in a minivan
And I'm sittin on 20 inch rims......
