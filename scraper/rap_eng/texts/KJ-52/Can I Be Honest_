[Intro: KJ-52]
Can I be honest?
Will they even here me?
Would they even listen?
Do they even care?
Does it even matter?
Does it make a difference?
If I was real

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
Ay yo
What if I spoke with, complete honestness
What if I told you that I've broken some promises
I've dealt with pride ever since a little kid
I've compromised and I've doubted like Thomas did
I can't hide though
He sees the way I live
And every single time I told every little fib
I can't deny 'cause He's already knowin' this
But to my wife, I regret the times that I missed
Been on the road when I really should've been home
Been on the phone I took calls I should've left alone
Shouldn't of done that
See I want you to know
Should've been with you not out tryin' to get dough
Still got issues, that's hard to let go
Still got some bitter situations with a few folks
Still got a temper that I work hard to control
Gotta remember that's your standard
And that's the goal

[Hook: KJ-52]
Can I be honest?
Can I be real?
Would they still listen
Just to how I feel
But if I was honest
If I was real
Would they even care
Just how I feel
(x2)


[Verse 2: KJ-52]
I wanna get back
Those who try to doubt me
I wanna hit back every time they try to clown me
I said some things about those who tried to down me
I've been too hard on some people that spin around me
Ima' workaholic, addicted to the game
Plus sometimes I've been addicted to the fame
I look deep inside
Things that I'm ashamed
Still the little kid conflicted and still in pain
But I'm so grateful when I think though how You found me
I used to be hateful of everything that's around me
I'm so thankful of the way that You still surround me
So shameful, yet You love me, it still confounds me
See I put myself first
I've gone days sometimes without readin' Your word
I've acted like a huge jerk
Yet You still love me
That's the thing that I have learned

[Hook]

[Verse 3: KJ-52]
Sometimes I dumb down
Sell a few records
Didn't do it though just to get a little cheddar
But lookin' back, coulda' made some of my songs better
Hindsight's 20-20 so I'm like "whatever"
But I regret some of my, broken relationships
No matter how hard I tried just to make 'em fit
And I don't blame myself
I'm not blaming them
Too many up in my life
I just came and went
We're not perfect
I serve a God who is
I serve a God who lives
Says that I'm His kid
When I shoot for the mark and when I shoot and miss
I serve a God who gives a new start and He forgives
He takes everything I ever did
And then He throws it in the Sea of Forgetfulness
See I'm just bein' honest
I hope you gettin' this
'Cause He's my promise
The reason that I live

[Hook]

[Outro: KJ-52]
What should I say?
What should I write?
Should I even say it?
Does it really matter?
Would they even listen?
Could I be honest?
Would they even care?
Would they even...(x3)
