[Chorus: Chris August]
This is the best day ever
You are the best thing ever
This is the best day ever
You are the best thing ever

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
I'm awake got the coffee poured
But I'm running late going out the door
But I'm on my way heading out on tour
When the coffee fell straight on the floor
You ever felt this way before?
When your face is sore and your brain is raw
And all you want to do is complain some more
Cause every highway lane feels like a war
It's a struggle to praise the Lord
But you on a race and your blazing forward
Your faith needs to grow some more
So when the road gets hard just remain
Assured that

[Chorus: Chris August]
This is the best day ever (this I know)
You are the best thing ever (oh oh oh)
This is the best day ever (this I know)
You are the best thing ever

[B- Section:]
It's all because of You You You You You
It's all because of You
It's all because of You You You You You
It's all because of You

[Verse Two: KJ-52]
If I could write an essay on the best day
Had to be the one where I get changed
Had to be the one where I get saved
From all the ways that I was and I been made
Brand new and Your love made a quick change
Had me heading down a road but I switched lanes
Now everywhere I go now it's so plain
Took everything that I done and it's thrown 'way
Turned all around like a segway
Seen through it an like an x-ray
Ever since I found just the best way
Every single day just the blessed day

[Chorus: Chris August]
This is the best day ever (this I know)
You are the best thing ever (oh oh oh)
This is the best day ever (this I know)
You are the best thing ever

[B- Section:]
It's all because of You You You You You
It's all because of You
It's all because of You You You You You
It's all because of You

[Bridge: KJ-52]
It's like the feeling that you get on your first date
Or just a hug when you're going through your worst day
It's like you're laughing with your friends till your sides ache
Layin on your bed while your both staying up late
It's what you said to your crush back in first grade
Or finding love when you need it in the worst way
It's like an answer to your prayer on your worst day
So from the bottom of my soul, this is what I say

[Chorus: Chris August]
This is the best day ever (this I know)
You are the best thing ever (oh oh oh)
This is the best day ever (this I know)
You are the best thing ever

[B- Section:]
It's all because of You You You You You
It's all because of You
It's all because of You You You You You
It's all because of You
