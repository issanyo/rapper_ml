She wanna go to the club have fun in the club
Find love in the club
And so she up in the club with thugs in the club
That roll in the club
And so she stroll in the club drinking it up
To the point where she buzzed
Now she been on the run forgotten the son
Plus all of his love
So she far and away she's fallen away
But he's calling today
He keeps calling her name she's crawling away
Now from all of his grace
Plus it's all been the same she's fallen ashamed
From going her ways
So she goes and she prays she hopes she can change
She's hearing him say

Anyplace that you are you can still come back
You ain't never too far you can still come back
All you gotta do is call you can still come back
Even if it seems hard you can still come back

He wanna run with the crowd he runs with em now
While they running about

They having fun and they bounce they go up in the house
Get drunk and they loud
Now they pouring it out they pour in there mouth they
Pouring it down
He's joining them now he's enjoying it now
'Cause he's boys with them now
See he knows what is right he was rolling with Christ
But they rolled in his life
Now he goes every night he goes and he fights
He's rolling the dice
You see he's chosen the life but deep in his mind
Man his soul isn't right
He's keep closing his eyes going so blind
Trying to run from the light but-

So you thinking you far you thinking it's hard
You thinking your scarred
Now you thinking you'd call but thinking that God
He would put up a wall
Don't think that all cause the big and the small
He's there for us y'all
Right there if you fall he's there with his arms
So hear him when he calls saying-
