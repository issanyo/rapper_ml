Yeah, uh, uh
So much stress keeps running through my mind now
Fell into a mess that I that wish that I could climb out
I guess I hide it so nobody'll find out
The way everyone thinks that everything is fine now

At home things are messed up with mom and dad
And at school all my friends stab me in the back
No one is real anymore, I hate the way they act
There's so many things that I wish I had

So God if You're there, do you understand?
Don't You care about anything that's happenin'?
It's not fair to put me through all this junk again
You see that I'm scared, so help me if You can

So please speak loud and clear cause I'm listenin'
I need to know that You're real cause I'm strugglin'
You need to show that You're here cause I'm stumblin'
Show me that You care, this is why I'm saying this

Are you real?
I want to know
(I want to know)
Are you real?
Then let it go
(You got to let it go)

Are you real?
I want to know
(I want to know)
Are you real?
Then let it show
(You got to let it show)

It was right then when everything began to change
I started looking at these things in a different way
I saw life through God's eyes and it wasn't the same
And it was right at the time I called on Your name

Then I saw all these lies that was thrown away
I recognized that I need You and on that day
I cried out and seek You, that was when You came
Now that I see You, I've been through a major change

And I believe that You're real cause it's so plain
I finally feel I can make it through anything
It don't matter what they speak or if they hate
They can't keep me down no more cause I seen Your face

And for now on never will I be the same
Cause I'm staying strong and I won't bend this way
Now that I know that You're real, it's gonna be okay
Yeah, You're speaking in my ear and this is what You say

Are you real?
I want to know
(I want to know)
Are you real?
Then let it go
(You got to let it go)

Are you real?
I want to know
(I want to know)
Are you real?
Then let it show
(You got to let it show)

See there's a war that's going on outside
And You can try to ignore and just run and hide
But everyday more and more people die
See the battles for souls, we're on the front lines

So many souls, just too scared to fight
They're too worried about what people thinking of their life
How can You fight if You don't lay down Your pride?
And how will anyone see if You won't shine Your light?

So many of Your friends walking around blind
You got the source that can open up their eyes
It's y'all's choice what you do with your lives
But I'm gonna go to war cause I made up my mind

Jesus gave us life when He went and died
So the least that I could do is give Him all of mine
So how many of y'all are ready to fight by my side?
Cause this is what He's saying right now here tonight
Come on

Are you real?
I want to know
(I want to know)
Are you real?
Then let it go
(You got to let it go)

Are you real?
I want to know
(I want to know)
Are you real?
Then let it show
(You got to let it show)
