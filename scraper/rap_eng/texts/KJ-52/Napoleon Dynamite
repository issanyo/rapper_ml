I used to have hair like Napoleon Dynamite
I tried to grow a rat tail and my jeans were kind of tight
I used to have hair like Napoleon Dynamite
I did the running man and I dressed like Vanilla Ice

I used to just chill at the bus stop
Just doing whatever I feel like I wanna do, gosh
I used to listen hip hop
Asked my friend, "Are you gonna eat all your tots?"

I used to ride my bike down a big hill
Fall off, sweet jumps and be like it kills
And used to get dissed by the girls
Because I didn't have any good skills

I used to have hair like Napoleon Dynamite
I used to watch eighteen like every night
I used to have hair like Napoleon Dynamite
When all my friends had a car, I still rode my bike

I was really good at tether ball
And ligers were pretty much my favorite animal
Brown suits are awesome, incredible
Quesadillas are really very edible

Vote for KJ, he's elect-able
Tina, eat your ham, it's not a vegetable
Rex Kwon Do is really very wonderful
And that's why I keep telling y'all

I used to have hair like Napoleon Dynamite
[Incomprehensible] said I couldn't rap 'cuz my skin was white
I used to have hair like Napoleon Dynamite
But since I got Jesus now I know it's gonna be alright

I used to have hair like Napoleon Dynamite
I tried to grow a rat tail and my jeans were kind of tight
I used to have hair like Napoleon Dynamite
