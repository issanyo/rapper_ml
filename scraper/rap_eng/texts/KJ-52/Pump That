One mike one cord to proclaim one rhyme
Of One God one Christ one Lord in one line
'Cause He's more than I need now he's more than I write
He's the air that I breathe he's the peace in my mind
He's the relief I seek when everything isn't right
He's what I hope I can be he's what I hope I can shine
He's the hope when I'm weak he's what opened my eyes
He'll call me home then I see him then I'll go to the skies
Now I know every need he can meet every time
So I know that for me he's what I need 'cause I'm blind
I can't see unless he just guides me through the night

Now we're helpless we're weak now we all fall behind
Unless you help us so be my strength when I climb
Cause this mountain I face is so hard and so high
But I know that you be what I seek and I find
There's nothing I need except you so I cry that

One mic one cord to proclaim one track
One God one Christ one Lord and just that
I need my wife by my side and my friends at my back
Since God goes before ain't a thing that I lack
I'm covered by Him what more could I ask
Everything can be a lie all I need is one fact
That Jesus is Lord I'm convinced that I can't
Make it w/out your word as my guide and my map
I need you to you to provide the strength so I'll stand
When my world falls apart and I think that I can't
Get that far and it's hard but that's when your hands
Take my heart when it's scarred and helps me understand
So all that I need is to do your commands
Everything that I see falls in line with your plans
So help me just to be all you've called and you've planned
And if you know what I mean let me see all your hands and
