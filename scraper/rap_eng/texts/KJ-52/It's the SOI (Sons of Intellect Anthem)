[Intro: Phanatik]
It's Phanatik / you know how I do
In a rage / flip the page with cage-52
And ain't no stopping that / on top of that
I got Ambassada / blasting ya / with the fact

[Hook: KJ-52]
Yo it's the SOI / unified / glorified
Recognize / the Most High / El Shaddai
Realize / you can't run / you can't hide
We verbalize / just to open up the eyes

[Verse 1: Phanatik]
Who brings the pain / along with the prominence
Dominant / with godly wisdom / not just common sense
Omniscient / in the repertoire with the rest
Of the Attributes / that disputes man's best / and guess
Who keeps the toughest emcees / on they knees
In the midnight hour / saying please
To the same God they dissed on they album
From the office of the White House to the slums in Shaolin
I challenge / the smartest to the phattest / rhyme-flipping acrobatist / to step up / and tell us what's the status?
I'm not rhymin' so you can give me mines
I pull strings so that the Son's light can shine through your mini-blinds
See anytime you see me and mines holding mics
It's only so the Son can be seen in a whole new light
Cause ever since the days of my youth / I've been out to raise the roof / to shed light and help men gaze at truth
This ain't pain / this is passion you seeing
This ain't a game / when u was at Athens Coliseum
Being chased while crying / getting ate by lions
Showing faith while dying / as we wait for I AM

[Verse 2: The Ambassador]
Like thugs scrambling the bait is just scandal
I tried to run from Christ but got turned around like cars by a .. handle
I met the Son / the One that even loves vandals
How much / more than sick kids love Campbell's
More than romantics love candles
He made me holy / but let me stay rugged like Lugz sandals
You can't believe this / you see this ordinary outside
But something's / significantly different so your mouth's wide open / scoping a hypostatic mixture
God indwelling a man is butter what a picture
Crackpots / who hit the jackpot / rolling with Christ like business men with the laptops / we set the backdrop
Sin is ugly / wrecks more lives than drunk drivers and plus we've Seen it turn hard rocks to slushees
You're a dreamer if you see this world with no Redeemer
And thinking its gonna hold up that's like a thigh with no femur
This one's crazy / one shady / never wanted just one lady
Met The Loophole kid and did a 180
One saves me / Jesus the right one baby
Praise the God who brought me out like He did blacks out of slavery / call the Navy / His love is sea-deep and wavy
We wave the white flag / surrendering to God who made the
Whole world / with the design flyer than Paisley
Christ the Chief Shepherd / and we're the First Lady
The Church / and when He comes back / you know it's swazy
No ifs, ands, or maybes / we're out like the 80s

[Verse 3: KJ-52]
Too busy, huh? Yo, stop the blasphemies
I'm going to battle steady charging like some batteries
Graduate, first class, Cross Movement academies
Phanatik, Ambassador, to stimulate your faculties
[?] laced up like Parry C's
You getting on probably running with the Pharisees
Laying with the dogs, and you waking with the fleas
52 spitting words, deep like Pacific seas
I verbalize full circle, 360Â°
Dust be getting shocked, the heaven's mentalities
Lyrical missionary threaten the bias, match these
Triple trinity that reigns now throughout the seas
Overweight lyrics might call for arteries
But your hypocrisies will become your casualties
So, smoking threes had at least fatalities
I'm waiting for the day the whole world comes to His knees
Hoping with the Movement 240s not His steez
So underfed emcees, come and get your calories

[Hook]
