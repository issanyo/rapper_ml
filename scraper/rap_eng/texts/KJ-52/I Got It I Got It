[Chorus:]
I, I've got got it I, I've got got it
[repeat]
He got it got it that's right he got it got it
Can't you see what you need man he got it got it
He got it got it that's right he got it got it
It's plain to me it's plain to see that he got it got it

[Verse 1:]
I got my peace I got my joy I got this lease on life
It's plain to see you can't avoid on what I'm speaking I
Been changed and freed and now for me well see the reasons why
His grace and peace is all I need he's all I seeks to find
He came to me and took my place upon the tree and died
He took the blame for me and all the shame and sin and pride
And all the way since adam and eve just had the tree of life
We turned away just from his face to find a place to hide
Since that day we've been infected with this thing inside
It's like a cancer been detected up in the nick of time
But see the answer well I checked it then it freed my mind
I got a mansion that be standing upon the other side
One day he's landing so understand when he crack the skies
There was a canyon between me and God a great divide
But now I'm standing on this rock with his hand in mine
And what I gots a whole lot more than what I left behind c'mon...

[Chorus:]
I, I've got got it I, I've got got it
[repeat]
He got it got it that's right he got it got it
Can't you see what you need man he got it got it
He got it got it that's right he got it got it
It's plain to me it's plain to see that he got it got it

[Verse 2:]
So you can go and knock it when I say I got it got it
But when I goes to drop it you should know to go and cop it
Cause now I show and promise and when I flows I'm honest
I got a hope that's timeless to help you cope when times is
Hard as coal in diamonds but God will go and find them
No matter how far you scattered up on this road you climbing
So why don't you go rewind it you can go and find it
Your whole life and time is searching for golden linings
My whole assignment is to open closing eyelids
Those who knows who God is but live they live with blinders
I didn't go and rhyme this so I could flow the finest
See I chose to shine this for those that go in blindness
I was lost in darkness I went from plus to minus
I was lost and heartless and I was crushed and lifeless
Your love and kindness took all my wrong desires
And since I got it got it you can't quench the fires

[Chorus:]
I, I've got got it I, I've got got it
[repeat]
He got it got it that's right he got it got it
Can't you see what you need man he got it got it
He got it got it that's right he got it got it
It's plain to me it's plain to see that he got it got it
