[Verse 1: Rawsrvnt]
Alright I'm back again / Got my tee and my jeans / And my fresh fitted / Born in the South / Loving how I live / Florida boy / So you know how it is / And how it be / And whus hatnen / Got a sneak peek to the main attraction / Freed from sin with life everlasting / Regardless if a gun go click click blasting / We gonna enjoy the weather / And the treasure / At the end of the rainbow / Even when the sunsets down on the halo / We ain't gonna stop / 'Cause we know where our faith goes / On and on and on / And on and on and on / Man it don't stop / Keep that thing moving / Whether it's rap or some punk rock / Have you in the back / Yelling back / Man you rock

[Verse 2: Rawsrvnt]
Who wanna / We got it / We did it / Brought the whole crew / So you know we gonna kick it / Time to hit the road and pay states a visit / Get ya bouncing and shaking and moving to the music / We wanna party and groove / With a diverse city / You know who / Jesus my Savior and thesis / Put Him on my ringtone / 'Cause I gotta witness / And share this joy / That's been burning in my heart and my soul / It don't even matter if you're young / Or you're old / Truth gotta be told / To your zip code / So let it be known / In and out your city / Jesus is the one that loves you without no pity / So crank them ampâ€™s up / We 'bout to blow the roof off / With a jam that'll have you saying / Boy that's tough

[Chorus B]

[Verse 3: KJ-52]
Let it rattle on / Ride the junk like it just got a saddle on / In the street with my peeps understand it's on / Holding on in the modern day Babylon / Concrete like the streets that we travel on / Bunch of freaks with the beats you can tagalong / Underground like I'm creeping in the catacomb / No sleep working late 'til the sun is gone / So anytime that you find me / Keep in mind I got an army behind me / Connected to the body like a Siamese / Pushed up in the party with a hi-c / I was living so blindly / In the flesh like the skin with an iv / Poisoned by my sin like it's ivy / But You're the reason that I live / I'm free

[Chorus A]

[Chorus B]
