[Hook]
Rise up, lift your eyes up
Get up, stand up, throw your hands up
[x3]

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
Sick of all the lies, sick of the compromise
Sick of the way we live our lives and run and hide
Sick of the times we turn our head, close our eyes
Can you hear the cries when you gonna rise?
Stand up, my people in the place, where you at?
Stand up, God's people who ain't ashamed, where you at?
Stand up, if you say you know His name, where you at?
Stand up, 'cause you gotta proclaim what you have
Rise up, no more hiding, no time for crying
And you can't be the light of the world when you ain't shining
Straight rhyming so you'll be straight recognizing
You ain't trying you just sitting there straight whining
While the whole world around you just straight dying
So keep in mind Jesus, Lion of Zion
He gave his life, so you and I wouldn't be frying
Quit hiding, it's time for you to start rising

[Hook]

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
Yo, yo, to all my real live people in the spot now
Rise up let me see what you got now
We blowing holes in your speakers when we rock now
We keep it hot now, every time we rock towns
That's how we got down, every time we drop sounds
So you know you better listen when I talk now
Cause we never stop now, or let your guard down
Cause if you got the answer, why keep it locked down?

[Verse 3: Rob Beckley]
How many people want to see this rock now?
Go bump it in your trunk, rolling with the top down
Hold on, cause I'm letting the missile drop now
No hostages, cause we're taking your whole block down
Yo, we hot but not tropic in the mall
Might catch me in a hot topic
We can talk if somebody wanna knock it
We coming at dangerous speeds, you can't stop it

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Come on, my people where you at is a spine
Get off, come on, right now
Everybody, now I say come on

[Hook x2]
