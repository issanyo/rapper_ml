[Chorus: Curt Anderson]
Hold on
You got this
Don't throw it away
Learn to forgive but don't forget
Even when it feels like the worst
Hold on
You got this
Don't throw it away
Make more memories than regrets
If nothing else just live and learn

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
What if I was talking to the younger me
Way back when I was three
Running up and down the street
Not a thing I'll ever need
No shoes up on my feet
Sitting in the puddle causing trouble for my family
I would say, "Get ready things are about to change"
I would say, "Hold steady even if you run away"
I would say, "Nobody knows what you about to face"
I would say, "Oh buddy hold for a better day"
You got them teachers all upon your case
Watching it just slip away
Feeling like it never changed
And now you feeling like your so deranged
Staring out the window where nobody seems
To know ya pain
Help now is on it's way
God knows what you face
Wipe all the tears away
Let go of all the hate
This all about to change
Know there's a better way
Roll with the punches
You can hold for a better day

[Chorus: Curt Anderson]
Hold on
You got this
Don't throw it away
Learn to forgive but don't forget
Even when it feels like the works
Hold on
You got this
Don't throw it away
Make more memories than regrets
If nothing else just live and learn

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
What if I was talking to the younger me
Thirteen with the shirt clean and some Dungarees
Acid washed ripped jeans
Stripe like a bumble bee
Running from the bullies in the hood tryna' come at me
Punching up the wall in the hall while I'm mumbling
Shoved in the stall then I fall down stumbling
Crawl to the wall then I hauled out hustling
Head home where it's all fall down crumbling
Wondering, Wondering anyone loving me?
Yes there is for the kid feeling ug-a-lee
Zits on your face and your kicks quite struggling
Helps on its way its gonna change quite suddenly
Screaming at the top of your lungs 'till its thunderin'
Words pound through ya head ya angers now bubblin'
Ran out the door down the street to your cousin nem'
Found out everything you need He had it covered, Man

[Chorus: Curt Anderson]
Hold on
You got this
Don't throw it away
Learn to forgive but don't forget
Even when it feels like the works
Hold on you got this don't throw it away
Make more memories than regrets
If nothing else just live and learn

[Verse 3: KJ-52]
What if I was talking to the younger me
Right around twenty three
Young MC hung-a-ry
Head full of dreams got a heart full of ministry
Head full of stream got some art for the industry
Can't find a part just to start in my own space
Too white, too broke, no talent, no name
That's what they said I went my own way
Messing with my head I don't listen to what they gonna say
But I need to be slow to speak
Take time just to breathe it keeps me in perfect peace
And enjoy all the mystery
Learn to shut up dude
Learn how to listen please
And through the darkest of ya days
He promises to stay
You gone make it through okay
And this is what I'd say

[Chorus: Curt Anderson]
Hold on
You got this
Don't throw it away
Learn to forgive but don't forget
Even when it feels like the works
Hold on you got this don't throw it away
Make more memories than regrets
If nothing else just live and learn
