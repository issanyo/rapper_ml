[T3]
Coming from the urban city ghettos
But we still King, queen, natural born rebels
Black tails, crack sales
Heavy [?], we do- (push it along)
We done seen everything
From niggas, gun fights, sellin' dope, gettin cream
It ain't the pressure, you can ask my ancestors
Trifecta from the Tribeca
I bet you we a (push it along)
Resurrect, lil' effort
Lil' 17 tryna' microphone check it
Niggas tryna' stress it
Rather see me Pyrexin'
That ain't me, that ain't we
We the essence

[Hook]
Push it along (uh-uh), push it along (okay)
Push it along, just push it along (come on)

[Baatin]
It's too much to spit, my life is kind of tragic
I'd rather spit a hit for the jam and be Kobe
Still on the quest like Phife and Jarobi
Gotta (push it along, just)
Tired of being bummed out

[T3]
Yeah, It's been a minute
Nothing short of 60 seconds
Can't stomach where I come from
Hard to eat breakfast
You ain't refined when you tryna' get acceptance
Gold Lexus, Rolex's, stupid dumb necklace
(Push it along)

[Baatin]
You see the rap game is stitched in my hoodie
Hype when I'm on the mic
To excite you like I'm Goodie Mob
Never slob
You guessed this, what is this
Spit [?] when I kick this, relentless

[T3]
Yeah, you did it to death
But that's a death wish
Gotta do it big like you Precious
Let's just

[Hook]
Push it along (uh-uh), push it along (okay)
Push it along, just push it along (come on)

[Bridge - 3x]
Push it with me, you gotta pull it (yeah)
You gotta do what you do
We keep it movin', yes
You gotta

[Young RJ]
Fuck the next saint
Young Trey got his cream on
Block got him braced
But his [?], the love gone
Bout' to move up, the Jefferson theme song
The means are extreme, but what he goin' lean on

[Phife Dawg]
Don Juice, top shotta
Who claim hotta?
Trash rhymers back off, your mics gettin' cut off
New York or Rock City
We never rhyme soft
Emphasizin' true spit, dat girth and grit (uh, yeah)

[Young RJ]
Rose Gold dreams, high self-esteem
Livin' on your knees ain't [?]
Clock don't stop, so the [?]
Don't clothes shop, tryna' cop
Heavy triple beams
You better (push it along)

[Phife Dawg]
Like Tribe's Instinctive Travels
Damn you know the voice, Mutty Ranks
Back in the saddle
Despite my hiatus, I stays ready to battle
King from Queens, get your ass out of my castle

[Young RJ]
Yeah, preacher told 'em but it ain't clickin'
Light switches get dimmer when it's gray and the sun missin'

You gotta do what you do
We keep it movin', yeah
You gotta

[Bridge - 2x]
Push it with me, you gotta pull it, yeah with me
You gotta do what you do
We keep it movin', yes
You gotta

Just push
