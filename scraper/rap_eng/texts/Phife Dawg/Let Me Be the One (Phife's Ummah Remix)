[Verse 1]
I guess we both have seen some brighter days
The promise of love for us has slipped away
Now I wanna be the one who keeps you safe and warm
Let me be the one
Oh

Although things with me and you didn't quite work out
There's still a special place deep in my heart
I wanna extend my unconditional love
Let me be the one
Yeah

[Chorus]
If you need a friend
Wanna be the one
Someone that you call
Really wanna be the one
The one through it all
You don't have to fall
Just let me be the one
Just let me

[Verse 2]
Promises made they've all worn paper thin
Still, honey, I'm not afraid to call you friend
Take a look and I know you'll see the possibilities
Let me be the one

To see you smile, there's nothing I won't do
Cause honey I only want what's best for you
You are a shining star, just stay the way you are
Let me be the one

[Chorus]
If you need a friend
Let me be the one
Someone that you call
Wanna be the one
The one through it all
You don't have to fall
Just let me be the one
Just let me

[Rap: Phife]
You know you wanna let me be the one
So why you wanna act fly?
I’m the player who keeps you swingin’ with them illy brown eyes
Phife Dawg, a/k/a the cat’s meow
Brotha with the knowhow
I never believed in exchanging no vows, but…
Too many chickens play, too many games
And wanna grab up on my arm for the lucci and fame, what…
Sleep in my bed, eat my food and think it’s chill
Then the next night they be with the Tonys and Dru Hill
Check it
I’m the type that be here for competition
Just an R&B mission, with, Mint Condition
Whether it be Miami Heat or Minneapol’ type code
A brotha like the Diggy needs someone to hold
So, meet me at the T’Wolves game tonight
Center court so I can give you the surprise of your life
What kind of man would I be, if I didn’t make it right
Eff that, you want me, my charm be life

[Chorus]
If you need a friend
Wanna be the one
Someone that you call
Really wanna be the one
The one through it all
You don't have to fall
Just let me be the one
Just let me

If you need a friend
Let me be the one
Someone that you call
Wanna be the one
The one through it all
You don't have to fall
Just let me be the one
Just let me

If you need a friend
Let me, let me
Someone that you call
Let me, let me
The one through it all
You don't have to fall
Just let me be the one
Just let me
