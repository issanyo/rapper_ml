Verse 1 (Phife Dawg)
Everytime yuh see mi licked mushitup dancehall
Mc’s big or small, mi nuh afraid it dem all

First come, first serve bases
Coolin’ out girl, I take you to the def places
I one of the kind, for you people the like
Plus, the shorty, his name Phife and I’m wreckin’ the mike
One time for you mind, and I’m chillin with notch
And, when they comes with rhymes, yo, I got mad styles
Six years in the game, and ain’t damn things change
???Set the warning, watch so many mc’s, they sounded on ring???
Manufact, too many mc’s they sounded on lie
To the point what you think, and they possessed to say mine
Same ?mazen?, gun took on, blunt smokin’, hoes smackin’
You see they just be append
And say hey jack when maybe rappin
But you may say: who the hell you there talk?
Punk  shorty from New-York, you have ?find ass?, better walk
But you no better than nigga fresh with those lips
Nuff crew, or no crew, I sink you whole fuckin’ battleship
You better hold ass when you see the size adidas
Watch out them punks ball out, or god baby Jesus
So don’t say the battle word, I be on that ?panto?
And if I loose, I leave my nuts and ?gun down?
