[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Everybody out your seats and off of the wall
It's the Phife Diggy Dawg on Arsenio Hall
Kicking rhymes, kicking beats just strictly for the streets
And if it's Burger King well then I suggest you eat
A little hip-hop from the tip of the top of the dome
Make the sucker MC's wanna go home
Whether you're from that place or whether you're from this place
I'm straight from New York, but Atlanta is my main place
Check out the style as I kick it like whatever
My rhyme style is ill, plus my brothers is twice clever
So check it how I kick it one time for your mind
Rough daddy crew coming through, yo check the rhymes

[Hook: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
You on point Phife?
Once again, Tip
You on point Phife?
Once again, Tip
You on point Phife?
Once again, Tip
Word

Okay

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My style is great, ask your peoples can I dominate?
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your midsection
My shit is love, simply meaning that my joint is tight
Amping up the mic making sure production's tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day you'll be on my jock
My name's Malik, my hobby's putting MC's to the test
And if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Freestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop
You crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops

[Hook: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
You on point Phife?
Once again, Tip
You on point Phife?
Once again, Tip
You on point Phife?
Once again, Tip
Word
Watch me bust their shit
Okay

[Interview: Phife Dawg]
Been in the studio for so long
That's like a reward to me, people appreciating it
I like it
Besides, them buying our records
Coming out and see us play

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along
The freaking fame, someone tell em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues
So hear me out one time, you gots to be yourself
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your freaking self
I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang
And yo, we'll see who can hang yo

[Hook: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
You on point, Tip?
Yo once again, Phife
You on point, Tip?
Yo once again, Phife
You on point, Tip?
Yo once again, Phife
Ayo that kid is marvelous

[Outro: Phife Dawg]
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your friggin' self
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your friggin' self
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your friggin' self
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your friggin' self
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your friggin' self
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your friggin' self
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your friggin' self
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your friggin' self
