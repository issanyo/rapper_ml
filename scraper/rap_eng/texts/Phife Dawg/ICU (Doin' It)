[Intro: Q-Tip]
New in hip-hop technology
A Tribe Called Quest presents new style

[Chorus: Q-Tip + Erykah Badu]
I C U doin’ it, girl
I C U doin’
I C U doin’ it, girl
I C U doin’
I got my Gucci, Fendi, and my thing
And I’m just sitting here waiting to get in something
I C U doin’ it, girl
I C U doin’
I C U doin’ it, girl
I C U doin’
And then I saw somebody that looked like you
When you was at the bar with the Heineken brew
I C U doin’ it, girl
I C U doin’
Well, I don’t got time ‘cause the joint is bangin’
Just watching you, doing my thing
I C U doin’ it, ma
I C U doin’
I C U doin’ it, ma
I C U doin’
Yo, the beat, it go…

[Verse 1: Q-Tip + Phife + both]
Kinda traditional, kinda rough
But the beat don’t deter me from your stuff
I mean, uh, I wonder if I get it enough
I’m an addict and dramatic, and I vote for your touch
It’s those things you do that got my head twist
Spontaneous, director of your own flick
Box office hit, strictly those cutting those trips
Theresa Randle type chicks, I call her ‘Girl 6’
Caramel complexion, Gucci Rush scent
Sexually intense, abstinence nonsense
Lights, camera, I’ll direct the action
Foreplay setting off her chemical reaction
Complete satisfaction, all around attraction
Go ahead and tell, ma, now don’t it feel relaxing? Woo
Now let me be the man in the canoe
That shy little guy who stroke right and pleases you
When it come to penetratin’ you, must variate you
Real estate agent, have to properly locate you
Same position and geographic place
Wanna, do the thing, show I appreciate

[Chorus: Q-Tip + Erykah Badu]
I C U doin’ it, girl
I C U doin’
I C U doin’ it, girl
I C U doin’
I C U doin’ it, girl
I C U doin’
I C U doin’ it, girl
I C U doin’

[Verse 2: Q-Tip + Phife + both]
From the first day I saw ya, knew I had to bag ya
ESPN Zone, you were sipping on a lager
I’m way across the room and we made the eye contact
Had to say somethin’, consequences, nevermind that
I’m staring in your eyes, vision of locking lips
36D’s, damn, I love ‘em well equipped
AC on blast got you stroking some hard nips
Covering chick, it’s her I need to be with
She had a Midwest twang
Well, at least that’s how it sounded
3-1-7, representin’ out of town, kid
Only question now is: ‘How could I be down?’
It’s conventional to me because I really love her style, and…
Forever my lady, you like how that sound?
Soca man am I, which we all lovin’ by the pound
‘Cause my name is Phife, girl, I’ll never leave your side
Let’s go ahead and walk these dogs and represent Tribe

[Chorus: Q-Tip + Erykah Badu]
I C U doin’ it, girl
I C U doin’
I C U doin’ it, girl
I C U doin’
I C U doin’ it, ma
I C U doin’
I C U doin’ it, ma
I C U doin’
I C U doin’ it, girl
I C U doin’
I C U doin’ it, girl
I C U doin’
I C U doin’ it, ma
I C U doin’
I C U doin’ it, ma
I C U doin’
I C U doin’ it

(*scratches* “Doin’ it”)
