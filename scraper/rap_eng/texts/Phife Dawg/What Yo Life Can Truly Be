[Intro: Vinia Mojica]
Saturdays for you to see
What yo life can truly be
Saturdays for you to see
What yo life can truly be
Saturdays for you to see
What yo life can truly be
Saturdays for you to see
What yo life can truly be

[Verse 1: Dave (of De La Soul)]
Son, sun is on thick, thick
One thought coming up quick, quick
Wishing that the days would come up six
Friday's the Red Alert radio mix
Then comes the day that nobody plays that
Punishment wish in the crib
Time to go chase the dibs
On a Saturday fiasco
Bright, bright, bright is the ears
All fun, game and no biz
Business, one naughty note
Rock the boat, don't rock the boat, baby
Jingle it, jingle it, jingle and swing
Here comes the just have fun that we bring
Don't debate, no, don't debate
Don't make me wait, just grab your roller skates

[Chorus]
Have fun, have fun
Have, have, have fun

[Verse 2: Dres (of Black Sheep)]
Yo, yo, I'm up, out, moving all about
It's Saturday again? Eheh, no doubt
Where's my skate key? Yo where's my skates?
Ayo where's my huh—I mean, where's my date?
‘Cause if it is today
I see sunshine, I want to play
Fill up my shoes, pit stops Sunoco
Yo mister with the 50 cent cocoa
Ice, ice, me baby
Cause the Black Sheep Dres be up on the scene
Let the top down, turn up the sound
Got my hands in the air cause my drawers are clean

[Chorus]
Have fun, have fun
Have, have, have fun

[Verse 3: Posdnuos (of De La Soul)]
Yo, now I got the rice cakes, I got the rice
Ridicule the roller if the skates don't suffice
Sustaining the honeys like the rim holding smoke
I was never good for fixing, so yo, I go for broke
Push up the pusher, but hold up on the pull
Cause Saturday's here and summer's holding like wool
So let it be known, I had to get flown
Unless Mase plays the Vaughan Mason I'm racing
Up the side, a little to the left
Got on the jacket so I'm cooking like a chef
But I'd rather be safe like my man safe sex
Cause a man without a plan is cancelled O’s on a check
But back on track, get the skates off the rack
Cause the best roller king is the new ladies mack
The '91 Sheep will supply the two
The Plug One will be fine, playing Saturday's fool

[Chorus]
Have fun, have fun
Have, have, have fun

[Verse 4: Q-Tip (of A Tribe Called Quest)]
Wait a minute, hook, you know you got the look
But don't play me out cause it's a Saturday and shit
Running 'round town while at home I sit
Staring at my boob tube
Listen to the box for a new groove
If I don't hear it then I get my spirit lifted
I sit and write a rhyme ‘cause I am that gifted
Got a five gear shifted in reverse
And I'm mista Quest pose with the De La verse
The Saturday is, uhm, rolling around
And oh it gets me waken out on the sound
Disrespected on days of the week
When the Saturday comes, that's when I hits peak

[Chorus]
Have fun, have fun
Have, have, have fun

[Verse 5: Maseo (of De La Soul)]
Saturday's the day that bring me joy
Jumping in a hoop, pick up my boys
Shorty D, B Love, light with a big bite
Sparking up skunk, well alright
Sunoco put my tank all full
Before we’re out, Life, feed the pit bulls
Pit bulls, that's what the logo be
With the noun stuck for the K9 wreck
A Saturday's a day that can't be wasted
Air so fresh I can even taste it
Back in the hoop, give a toot-toot
Throw it in one, now here's the fun
Southern state with a freestyle tape
Headed to the rink, none of us can skate
See some cheese most-wanted on peep-out scheme
I train in mind with my team

[Chorus]
Have fun, have fun
Have, have, have fun

[Verse 6: ???]
What the hula hoop's spinning for the chosen of ‘em
Yeah the Saturday's sure to be nice and lovely
Bzz, the honeybee sting brings cupid
Skins in here, make 'em run around buckstupid
Uhoh, yeah, chosen in there
So shake ya derriere
Now, the brother that you're peeping is thorough
And I cruise the streets in a red Montero
Pick up my crew and then we chop-chop make it
To the Quik Mart and get the blunts, cool
Laces come as next suggestion
With no question, if ends are guessing
Everybody bounce, skate, rolling and lighting it
And right about now, the honeybee be kited
Me and honeydip see eye to eye
And if I see bull, she'll walk on by
But that's not the style of the black child
Broke from the shine, I get it go on the show
We'll interfere, stick and steal be the deal
Come get with the sicker Saturday flow, yo

[Chorus]
Have fun, have fun
Have, have, have fun

[Verse 7: ???]
Friday be the fly day but Saturday be my day
I'm rolling with the Soul on skates, I can't wait
Time to let the good times roll, let's lose control
When Sunday come, we've got put it on hold
Feel the vibe, feel the bass, feel the treble in the place
Got your skates string up, so let's skate
For goodness' sake, don't take a break ‘cause it’s a Saturday
You’ll never know again if you’ll have another phatter day
Ride the rhythm and get with 'em for this fun day
It's not a whole week here to speak, it's just one day
So leave all your troubles behind
And come climb to the Saturday's rhyme

[Verse 8: Phife Dawg (of A Tribe Called Quest)]
I worked all week, now it's time to relax
Searching for a honeycat I can mack
Wanna go to Great Adventures, all these places
But oh shit! Why not go to Laces?
Do a little rollerskate and bust my ass and all that
Crazy skins in the mix, I bring the jim hats
Lounging with the fellas, system booming in the car
Scoping out the honey with the D cup bra
Shout out to Aletta, know I wanna do her
Gassing like Eddy, now I know she's ready
Like Father MC, great is how I'll treat her
But I'll diss the ho if her name is Bonita
