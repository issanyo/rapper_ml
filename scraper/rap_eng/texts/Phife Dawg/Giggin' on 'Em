[Verse 1: Shaquille O'Neal]
Hi, my name is Shaq and I wanna go pop
Not, I gots to have a hip in my hop
Tell me which emcee can rock the party like me
Notorious seven-footer (with 'nuff harmony)
Never hesitate when it's time to rock a rhyme
Brothers go for yours then watch me go for mine
I'm good for the cheer 'cause I gots the know-how
Forever doin' damage to one's ear canal
Enter with a frown and I leave with a smile
You're soon to figure out that Shaq is worth your while
Seein' is believin' and you best believe it
And if you're from Belize, well then you best Belize it
Sometimes I get crazy and this is how I feel
Ben Franklin who? Put Shaquille on the 100-dollar bill
So I can get doped out and then spin
High like special-ed, my man, but I'm the Shaq-nificent
Standin' in my b-ball stance, I know you heard
I start fires like Donnie Wahlberg
I make paste and stake outta steak, state to state
'Cause I'm too great, hold up, wait
I get vexed when you disrespect
Should I put you in check or should I break your neck?
You think you're hard but your lyrics are soft
I hate when emcees yell to get their point across
And I gigged on 'em

[Hook 1: Phife Dawg and Shaquille O'Neal]
No batty emcee cyan test
Lick off the "S" offa Superman chest
Yeah, and I gigged on 'em
You ah di big daddy one
Rude boy with the sensation
Ha ha, I gigged on 'em
You better face reality
Big Shaquille with the mentality
Yeah, and I gigged on 'em
You better run, goh holler, arrest me?
Mi ah di Phife ah from A Tribe Called Quest

[Verse 2: Shaquille O'Neal]
Bo! Bo! Bo!
Let off a shot one time
This, I dedicate to the punks that can't rhyme
I never fake the funk on the dunks, neither my lyrics
Reel to Reel like Puba, so sucka come wit' it
When it comes to the micra-p-h-o-n-e
I got mad lyrics, in other words plenty
When the emcee want to battle then it's on
What the hell made him think he could get with Shaquille or Shaun?
You run your jibs but you get no dibs
My style is deadly like the virus that we all call HIV
Huh, my top choice with the ragga-like voice
Fix my lips for the mic, make sure it sounds moist
Like a Betty Crocker or a Duncan-Hines cake on
My delivery? It sounds frosty like a shake
Big up myself every time, rewind
I come rough like McGruff, I take a bite outta crime
Little teeny-weeny bits 'cause my styles are legit
Phife Dawg is in the house so sit, Ubu, sit
And watch me gig on 'em

[Hook 2: Phife Dawg and Shaquille O'Neal]
Nuff respect to all crew
You and you and God knows who
And I gigged on 'em
You ah di lyrical champion
Mr. Shaquille you ah di bubbling gun
Watch me gig on 'em
Yes, him ah lyrics yuh nuh diss
Oh powder puff DJ dem ah goh diss
That's right, watch me gig on 'em
Come leh we jump on di track
Lyrics ah come from behind God's back
Bo!

[Outro: Shaquille O'Neal and Phife Dawg]
Prepare to fall to them knees like chopped trees
I rhyme likeâ€”
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Chill, chill, chill
You don't have to kick a third verse, just let those people know all the fellas and peoples you gigged on
