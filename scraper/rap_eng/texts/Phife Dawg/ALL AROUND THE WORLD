[Intro - Phife Dawg]
Yo, what it is? What it do? What's goodie?
You are now tuned in to the sounds of
A Tribe Called De La Peas
L.A. New York collabo
You know what it is, East West all day
I go by the name of- ahh don't worry 'bout that

[Chorus]
(All around the world) Come take a trip, Ma
(All around the world) Come rock with us
(All around the world) Come vibe with us
(All around the world) Come ride with us
(All around the world) Come ill with us
(All around the world) Come build with us
(All around the world) Who wanna spit with us?
Come make it bounce (keep bouncing)

[Verse 1 - Phife Dawg]
We on that world tour with Muhammad again
Fifty cities run with Black Eyed Peas 'n them
First show in T-Dot where the shorty's be gems
Twenty-thou' loosin' they minds as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm more like Stephen Curry with the mic though
Kyrie Irv's sweety with that Bubba Chuck handle
First heard me in the nineties with that native tongues yo
Raspy type flows, De La jones arose
Twenty five years later, ain't too much done changed, B
Owner of three homes with my eyes on a Bentley
Drive support system, I could never be shady
Me cheat the game, fuck I look like, Brady?
Staples in LA, Japan, Sapporo Dome, Camp Nou in Barcelona, Sweden's Ericsson Globe
Make a hater's stomach bubble til they straight up hurl
And while I'm out on tour keep ya hands off my girl
As we commence to rock

[Chorus]
(All around the world) Come take a trip, Ma
(All around the world) Come rock with us
(All around the world) Come vibe with us
(All around the world) Come ride with us
(All around the world) Come ill with us
(All around the world) Come bill with us
(All around the world) Who wanna spit with us
(All around the world) Come make it bounce

[Verse 2 - will.i.am]
Creepin' like a zone creeper, reekin' like I smoke reefer
Mind reader, thought leader, no blink and never sleeper
Beat you with beat beater, EQ the bass deeper
Attitude like Ice Cube, put you in that cold freezer
A hundred miles of running so I ran a hundred kilometers
Grim Reaper ain't hunting 'cause they couldn't kill the leader
Tried to break my center but they couldn't come a centimeter
Blast off, semi-up, arcade Centipeder
Space Evader, Animater, rollin' with the alligator
Glow like illuminator, follow I'm the navigator
Overthrowin' dictators, posin' for the pic takers
Dick in swollen digits, paper aggregator
Yeah, I'm on that Hip-Hop grown shit
EMC squared means I'm on the microphone shit
Dead with mumble rap, Attack of the Clones
I'm on that Jedi , I'm in that ziggy, ziggy zone

[Chorus]
(All around the world) Come take a trip, Ma
(All around the world) Come rock with us
(All around the world) Come vibe with us
(All around the world) Come ride with us
(All around the world) Come ill with us
(All around the world) Come bill with us
(All around the world) Who wanna spit with us
(All around the world) Come make it bounce

[Verse 3 - apl.de.ap]
Flow tighter, globe trotter, don't need a ghost writer
Night time, all nighter, rhyme like a bull fighter
Dynamite igniter, near sider, far sider
Legally blind but I got the foresight
Insider, outsider, Northsider, Southsider
West side, East side, every where I'm worldwide
Rugged like a Ruff Ryder, sunken like a skin diver
Plug in' I dug in, but don't cum inside her
Blessed with the insight, stay lit, I've been bright
Murder that ink, now you see how my pen fight
Inner space, outer space, base like an upright
Fornicate, in a cape, capable of flight
Up, up all the way, up on the throne
Kingdom I ring all them bell made from chrome
Bring only singles, so they give me dome
I'm in my zigga, zigga, I'm in my zone

[Chorus]
(All around the world) Come take a trip, Ma
(All around the world) Come rock with us
(All around the world) Come vibe with us
(All around the world) Come ride with us
(All around the world) Come ill with us
(All around the world) Come bill with us
(All around the world) Who wanna spit with us
(All around the world) Come make it bounce
(Keep bouncing)

[Verse 4 - Posdnuos]
I am not of this format
So let me formally
Introduce to you a formula
Standing on your doormat
I'm an East Coat equation
Qualified to earn it worldwide
Running through your tour laps
Twenty tears is gain like the currency
And I reside within the state of currently
So when I travel it seems my passport looks like
Them sandwiches made out of them ice creams
And when Jack Frost comes around
We bounce to the other side of the globe
To towns where he just can't chillax
Met up with peeps instead it has past to be safe
In a place where its known to get relaxed
Life's merry-go-round and she want to spin
Got me thinking about back when
Due to my dark skin
They ask me, when they pass me
They used to diss me, harass me
Now they ask me if they can kiss me

[Bridge]
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world

[Outro]
We went all around the planet (planet)
With big dreams, gigantic (gigantic)
Picture this shit, panoramic (panoramic)
We grew this shit organic (yeah)
We didn't blow up quick, we volcanic
We work that shit like mechanics (mechanics)
No sinking ship, no Titanic (Titanic)
To be specific, we crossed the Pacific and Atlantic goddamn it we
Worldwide
(All around the world)
(All around the world)
(All around the world)
