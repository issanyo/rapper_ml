Where am I, how did I get here?
Today is very different than yesterday
So this is the world?  I miss my old womb
The wallpaper here just ain't the same

This world is something strange
I'm wet, I'm cold, I need a change
This world is something new to me

Oh, my head! What is this? I can't take it!
Me either!

I'm hungry, I'm tired, I'm irritated
But I love the extra leg room
Man! They cut my cord!
Consider yourself lucky!

This world is way too big
And populated by fuzzy pigs
This world is something new to me

This world is such a gas
P.U., where's your class?
This world is something new to me

Quiet! can't a guy get some shuteye?
It's so noisy in here
I can barely hear myself suck

The food here tastes pretty good
My compliments to the chef
And you gotta holler to get fed
But I could get used to that

This world is way too bright
Can't somebody turn down the light?
So that's what that thing looks like

All things here are meant for play
It's gonna be a real cool day
This world is something new to me

This world is something new to me
