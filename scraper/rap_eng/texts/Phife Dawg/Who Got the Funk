[Verse 1]
Passengers all aboard this Brooklyn-Queens express
We got the Sound and Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest
Just in case some non-believers might contest this bout
We'll be sparking paper MCs on the low cool route
Some blame complexity, be rhyming from the dictionairy
I rhyme from memory its all in the chemistry
Peter channel did he doubt the host with the most
Roasting niggas from the star to the Ivory Coast
Some say they explodin', but they be implodin'
I block out evil eyes and leave 'em blinded like Odin
So get that 20/20 I'm a deeper visionary
I see through adversaries, and all their petty worries
This bitch called Wanda had me locked like an anaconda
I used to ponder, the ways that I could get beyond her
Her brother used to front but beef he used to want not
I had him fighting like a slave on an auction block
Hey Miss Behavin when I'm blowing up your safe haven
No better yet I'm haunting whack MCs like Wes Craven
Or Clyde Barker, the dread I rode with is darker
And damper this is rockin' wilder beats and parkers

[Verse 2 - Phife Dawg]

Yeah yeah it's the world's greatest five footer
Phife Dawg in the place to be
With my diabetic partner Beetle, kno' what I'm sayin'?
SOS in effect, I got the nikes on my feet and a knick jersey on
So check it out

Phife Dawg will hit you off with some rugg dat shit
Pass me the mic and watch us get intimate
Not only does it walk with me it talks to me
Pats me on the back and says:
'Son that was a job well done'
Why thank you, I'm glad I can be of great service
Cause its mad MCs out there nowadays that sound nervous
Life is too short to be sounding like a novice
You can't MC then get the fuck out my office
Niggas is like: 'Oh my Lord it can't be him again!'
Biting my style like a wolverine from Michigan
When I see a mic my dick gets stiffer than a mannequin
Been poppin' shit since the tender age of friggin' ten
After the share I'm sure that the people will be plexed with me
Especially, if they know they have no strategy
Don't mess with me I'm the one that you don't wanna see
You know my name, you must be drunk off fuckin' Henessy
Remember me, back in the days you didn't check for me
Play me out like as if my name was friggin' Stanley
All of a sudden I'm more famous than anus
???have brand new gayness??
Or better yet the virus
Kid don't even try it, just keep your monkey ass quiet
Fuck around with me you take a loss 4 years in a row like the bill
So you better chill, word
I got more whizz than George pallace
Or better yet Tom Landry in his years out on Dallas
Creative on my own, never had the urge to borrow
And if you don't believe me you can ask my girl tomorrow
About the wordplay, yes, peace to SOS
East Coast forever boy, cause the rest can't test

[Verse 3]
What you cowards know about that nigga rhyme flow
That's cooler than the tundra, and eviler than Mumra
I'm in that zonin' mode, 7-0-1's the area code
Me and Chamby higher than the lizard and the toad
Verbal mojo, my flow be magic like Orlando
If shit gets thick, i got the fuckin' madness clique
I smoke I smoke, I roll on niggas like a boulder
Murderer, too much blood up on your shoulder
When my metaphors spill I dunk on punks like grand will
My uncanny vocab skills have doctors saying that im ill
But I ain't sick I'm very healthy
And hope that rap makes me wealthy
Fuck a buck and a dream
I got a partner and a production team
We got the flows so say that you'll win battles chump
Verbally you're just a punk
That's how battleships get sunk
So recognize the mental when I step inside the center
Cause rappin's just a job, being a jigga's an adventure
