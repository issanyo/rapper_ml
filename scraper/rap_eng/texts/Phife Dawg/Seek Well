[Verse 1 CJ Fly]
We just happened to as meet in the club
I was there reading vibes, she was cheesing so much
Put my seeds on her buns
Feel it in her guts, anytime she take a crunch
Tried to take my spread when I seen her for lunch
The number I think she wanted when she ate
Driven going the distance with a couple different place
Overall they over shaped, had them digging in the crates
Got my chicks by the dozen, six that I done did
Became so redundant, used to front but now they want me
Find that shit so funny
My only prob with cam, is she loves to use a cam, posting pics on Instagram
Caption say she with her man
My only prob with sharon, is she do way too much sharing
It's apparent she don't care about her appearance
With her parents, looking for a baller with a bigger hoop earrings
It's all def true it must be F'ing up her hearing
If Emma leave then I go fuck with Emily
Or probably Bethany she live down in Beverly
You invite her to the crib then she'll probably never leave
Everyone had a turn, name rings bells on every street
The girls that I like, set goals in their life
Wannabe known as a wife not a ho for the night
Got this girls number, didn't know what to write
I Guess she wasn't my type

[Verse 2 A la Sole]
She wanna go get me now cause my team in the spotlight
She better be going down like she plumbing on the cockpipe
We at the top flight, without an elevator button
If I'm good for anything,you know I'm good for nothing
I roll the sumption then she come and try to puff it
I get up in her guts,no dutch but I stuff it
She cause a ruckus, when we fucking cause she love it
She never want to leave I wear her out like my bucket
We chilling like a villain, your chick a super ho
And I'm iron man I'm sticking ironing
But she can't leave the kid cause she used to pros
So don't fight it then just invite a friend
Like who am I to judge shawty preferences
Girl I steady turn heads like an exorcist
Straight exing chicks who are classy but they ashy
I know to take a L like a chair when they pass me

[Verse 3 Phife Dawg]
Okay I feel the energy inside the room no doubt
All eyes on me as if 2Pac touched down
New Year's Eve, Chitown favorite city (Word up)
Maceo from dela spinning, got the shrine turnt up
Pro era was performing, hey they ain’t no joke
Ooo, two mami’s in the [?], with that good ass smoke
Marisol from southside, Monique from hyde park
Just my luck, one likes them short, the other likes them dark
They mentioned they would love to start the New Year right
Love the fact that 3-1-2 chicks be so forth right
Off to the tele kid, you know my style
Cabby four points, rush street, magnificent mile
5”3  but 35, With the skin so soft
No no, keep on them vince komodos. But where that next gal gwan?
Open and take my third leg, Monique your girl wants to share
Burner to my back and ear, this was the moment I feared
So much for vibes.. huh?
