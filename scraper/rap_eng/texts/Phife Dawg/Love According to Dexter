[Skit: Dexter/Dee Dee]
Oooo, what does this button-?
Stop, stop, stop!

[Pre-Hook: Slick & Rose/Phife Dawg]
Come on (c-c'mon)
Come on (c-c'mon)
Come on (c-c'mon)
Come on (c-c'mon)
Come on (c-c'mon)
Come, wow, oh wow, oh wow (come, c'mon, c'mon, yeah!)

[Intro: Phife Dawg/Slick & Rose ad-libs]
Yes, yes, ya'll (Yes, yes, ya'll)
We don't stop, ya'll (We don't stop, ya'll)
Check, checkity-check, check, check
Dexter's lab, ya'll (Dexter's lab, ya'll, check it)
You're now rockin' with the best (best, best)
From the east, south, north to the west (west)
Rhythm Kids, Smokin' Needles about to bring it to your chest (oh, yes!)

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg/Slick & Rose ad-libs]
Some may see me as a loner, one who keeps to himself
A three-foot genius who might talk to himself
Most people think I'm crazy, if I were you I would too (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon...)
But when science is your life, tell me, what else can you do?
Most kids have plenty friends (I think you call that a crew?)
For me it's all about a lab (and my 400 IQ)
Staying focused is the key, I love when no one's around
Dee Dee, I love you sis, but I have no time to clown (no, no)
Gotta get my mind right, straight up my future is now
Concoction's anonymous, peep the way it goes down (yeah!)
Eight years and counting, yet I found my profession
Handle business with a question 'cause I'm all about progressin' (uh-huh)
That's the way it is when you enter a lab session
Everyday when I'm creating, it's quite invigorating
Knowledge is the key, well, at least it's my perception
(The lab, the lab!) Oops, pardon me, obsession (ha!)

[Pre-Hook: Slick & Rose/Phife Dawg]
Come on (yeah!)
Come on (yeah!)
Come on (yeah!)
Come on (yeah!)
Come on (yeah!)
Come, wow, oh wow, oh wow (yeah!) (here we go!)

[Hook: Phife Dawg/Slick and Rose/Together]
The name's Dex, ya'll, and it's the same old story
Where you been, kid? Lounging in the laboratory [?]
Making moves 'cause I refuse to lose
This is how I maintain, can't let the time reign
But who are they, Dex? Rhythm Kids, they keep it gully
Need names, ma? Ras, Roots, and Phife Diggy
Put your hand in the air if you wanna get busy
From the east to the west, L.A. down to Philly
It's like that, ya'll, and ya don't stop (B-Town turn it up!)
It's like that, ya'll, and ya don't stop (Mo-Town turn it up!)
It's like that, ya'll, and ya don't stop (Mack-Town turn it up!)
It's like that, ya'll,  chigga-chigga, ya don't stop (H-Town turn it up!)

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg/Slick & Rose ad-libs/Together]
Now if it wasn't for the chemistry (chemistry?)
No doubt about it, my life would be a misery
Picture me without technology (yeah!)
Better yet, ask Lil' Bow Wow how he feel without Jermaine Dupri ([?])
I'm too busy making history (that's right!)
That's the way it has to be and shorties will be chasing me
I love this game, it never ceases to amaze
For this deep knowledge I crave, I don't mind being its slave (c'mon)
I live for this, die for this, I will cry for this (cry for this)
So much to learn, I almost think that I've invented this (invented this)
My life relies on this and there's just no denying it
Mom thinks that I'm crazed with it, but hey, there be no fighting it
It's like an MC with flows when they be tight with it (Tight with it!)
There's no defying it, it's just something I can't resist
Love! Capital L, two U's, and one V
If it wasn't for the lab, I don't know where I would be
I love it when my brain's communicating with me
Science, I love science; that sound, it all seems natural for me (yeah!)
No one's allowed through them doors, it gets devious (Devious!)
My friends thought it was a faze being mischievous (Mischievous!)
But this lab is like my babe, forever you I lust
You know my style, it's personal and you cannot be touched
I'm not your average figurehead who simply yaps too much
Scientific name, drop it who gets left in the dust
I'm the one and only Dex, I tend to keep my game tight
Repping your favorite network every night

[Pre-Hook: Slick & Rose/Phife Dawg]
Come on (yeah!)
Come on (yeah!)
Come on (yeah!)
Come on (yeah!)
Come on (yeah!)
Come, wow, oh wow, oh wow (yeah!) (here we go!)

From the east to the west, L.A. down to Philly
It's like that, ya'll, and ya don't stop (A-Town turn it up!)
It's like that, ya'll, and ya don't stop ([?] turn it up!)
It's like that, ya'll, and ya don't stop (Oak-Town turn it up!)
It's like that, ya'll,  chigga-chigga, ya don't stop ([?])

[Outro: Dexter/Phife Dawg and Slick & Rose ad-libs]
Yes, that should do it!
(Dexter, you're my hero, you're my hero) (Say it again, say it again, say it again)
And once again, thanks to my magnificent and astounding genius
(Dexter, you're my hero, you're my hero) (Big Dexter, ya don't stop)
Science can hold its head up, head up, head up, head up...
(Help me out, help me out...) (Dexter, you're my hero, you're my hero)
(Big Dexter, ya don't stop)
(Say it again, say it again, say it again)
(Dexter, you're my hero, you're my hero)
(Ras, Roots and ya don't stop)
(Everybody, ya don't stop)
(Rhythm [?])
(Yes...another [?] Smokin' Needles...] (song fades)
