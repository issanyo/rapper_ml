[Hook 12X: Ali Shaheed Muhammad]
Mr. Incognito, Incognito

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Mr. Incognito is back again
Now all I want is peace and papes, and a physical friend
Jottin down my list of positives in life
I want a ride, crib, mutt, wife
The look on my grill is filled with conviction
Gonna get what I need, delete restriction
Babble on the boulevard to brother hood buddies
Pokin in my pocket it's the E for the moneys
Jay and all the jokes that jet in the Jettas
While I'm at the boob tube watchin Baretta
Swig up on a forty cause I'm feelin thirsty
Mama says she taught me, better say she cursed me
Throwin on my hoodie, low-profilin
Wassup with the Tipster? Brotherman be wylin
But I be on mission that's beyond eye level
Questin out the devil and his pals that are several
Quest with the Questers or Quest on a solo
Boomin in a Benzo, Beamer or a Bronco
Boom caca a boom boom, boom caca a boom
If my sight isn't seen, silly saps will assume
That we fallin off the Earth with the Nina and the Pinta
The Five Foot Assassin with the shade of magenta

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Magenta is the shade for the mystic parade
Physical Trini born, lyrically, I am swayed
Livin off Linden, 1-92nd
Chillin at the rest, other brothers wreck it
Easy like a morning, Commodore Sunday
Waited for a Tuesday, for manic Monday
When I woke Wednesday, persons was poundin
Don't know the whereabouts, can't be foundin
Feelin' for the feelin' for the one they call the Phifer
Still on the smooth but a tidbit hyper
Get with the get on as I hit the D-L
It's my thing what I bring, I try to do it well
You can bet your bottom dollar that the Tribe will not be slippin
Makin hit after hit as we commence to start rippin
People think I'm buggin or I have the heebiejeebies
The reason they can't find me is because they can't see me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
It's like the war's going on in the middle of your mind
But your mind can't contain Incognito's on the brain
So you chill by yourself
Don't really sweat nobody
Speak to all the brothers and say peace to every hottie
But lurking in the ghetto is a germ that insists
Should you back the germ away? Or utilize your fists
Neither of the two, just continue with your thoughts
And wash away your pain with the power of the quart
Ain't got no time for girls, 'cause girls be on some bull
Checkin for a nigga who got crazy pull
On some deep-rooted sexual, highly intellectual
Not checking for the fame although it's perpetual
I entered the world the same way I'll exit
If you really dig the groove, then hey, glad you checked it
'Cause Incognito's strong, not irking like a blister
Before you speak about me, make sure you call me Mister

[Hook]
