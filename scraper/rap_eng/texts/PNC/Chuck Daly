[Intro]

[Hook: Raiza Biza]
This that music that you drive to, revive to
On a daily, what you shine to, and strive to
On a daily, live your life to, survive to
On a daily
Play that thing like it's my last Chuck Daly
(We ain't givin' what they sayin', we just keep the music playin' on a daily)
Play that thing like it's my last Chuck Daly
(We ain't doin' what they doin', we just keep the wheels movin' on a daily)
Play that thing like it's my last Chuck Daly

[Verse 1: Raiza Biza]
From on a higher plane
I wear the coat, like it's custom made
Ain't nothing changed, we still adapting to another day
No other way, just be yourself until you come of age
We saw the wars touch the sky, but we were unafraid
Casablanca, mi casa su casa
We done built this shit ourselves, that's why we doing what we wanna
It's a vicious cycle, I pray for peace for all my rivals
We rewrote the rules, and found success with all this rhyming
Hope they understand that we here, I ain't holding back for nobody
Working hard for all that we wanted, plus we turn it up when we party
Turn it down for what, we enjoying it while we got it
Cause' today is all we have, and tomorrow ain't an option
Feeling motivated, like Chuck Daly and a dream team
So go and pour me some more, this ain't complicated at all
It's as simple as it can be, keep on going 'till we all gone
Put that pedal down to the floor
Yeah we know you got that music that you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: PNC]
Back on the pavement, it's the unadulterated
Say it's my new paid to fina' be a underrated greatest (Hey)
The frivolous talk for all the slackjaws, I be
Givin' them all that total rap, sure
What you rap for? To get a little fame in your town
Chunk change in your pocket, you ain't fucking with the prophet
Get it popping like when Robin ran the game of rebounds
Like when Jordan tried to score up in the lane, I beat him down
Bad boy shit, Chuck Daly or Biggie you can choose it
All I know is I just bring back all that feeling in my music, cruise it
Damn straight it's, New Zealand's most elitist
I'm god mode, no one in the game should try to beat us so
Heinous with the flow, hit yo [?] get your venus
You say that girl stuck up, fuck round us, she's the keenest bro
I got the keys they need to unlock all the codes
Raiza Biza, PNC
Back on the scene, we in the zone

[Hook]

[Outro: Raiza Biza]
This that music that you drive to, revive to
On a daily, what you shine to, and strive to
On a daily, live your life to, survive to
On a daily
Play the game like it's my last Chuck Daly
Play the game like it's my last Chuck Daly
