Moonlight dancing
How bout a little bitta little bitta
Moonlight dancing
Let's sli-i-i-ide, sip some wi-i-i-ine
How bout a little bitta little bitta
Moonlight dancing

You can find me in a club
Like Fifth in an 03
Black shades white tee like an OG
Back and me my clique and they lonely
Looking for a face like a chick from the OC
And I be, P-N-whoah, she the one like whoah
And I begin to show to her like I knew her
Is how we through and I split the game to her
This is how we do
Stay cool, im not trying to scare her
She dressed in red like Scarlett O'Hara
A silver screen queen, is a silver in her necklace gleam
And my Corvallis reflect that
She a porcelain skin I'm thinking how my bedlight gonna reflect that
Hmmmmm
Things that make you go...
Sip some CnC and hope that we can be....

I'm tryna move with you
Under the moon with you
And you said that you want it
(Moonlight dancing)
Well let's sli-i-i-ide, sip some wi-i-i-ine
Then a little bitta little bitta
(Moonlight dancing)
We get it right, under the moonlight
Let me know what you decide, maybe we can slide, right?
We get it right, under the moonlight
Let me know what you decide, baby we can slide right?

So dividend, go getta yeah
Tryna make a ginger to my friddastear
Get it clear, the kid ain't soft
In the mood like bedroom Kalishnakovs
Said lets kick it off
Coz my peeped up brazillian just slipped it off
So swift of course, getting pissed for sure
Better champagne cork just twist it off
Said lets toast to you
Bout to kill it like Costra and Nostra do
Like a maxi priest, close to you
Feeling pulla a magnum out the holster BOOM
Just laid her out
Put the R Kell's on just lazed about
Hit Jada now, hit the Nurofen plus
Let the moon just illuminate us

I'm tryna move with you
Under the moon with you
And you said that you want it
(Moonlight dancing)
Well let's sli-i-i-ide, sip some wi-i-i-ine
Then a little bitta little bitta
(Moonlight dancing)

Little bitta little bitta
(Moonlight)
How bout a little bitta little bitta
(Moonlight)

We get it right, under the moonlight
Let me know what you decide
How bout a little bitta bitta
Maybe we can slide, right?
