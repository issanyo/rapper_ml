[Intro]

[Verse 1: Louie Knuxx]
I got a vision
Of getting rich
Making money
Get my mother out the styx
Take my sister
Get my brother out that sich
Take him shopping out in Brussels
Taking sips
[?] heavy
Go designer from that Op Shop levy
Flying women 'cross the crater
Just for [?]
Pushing europeans
No more sitting in the bus stops
Four wheels gripping
Auburn wrapped in autumn linen
Ten years out my jail cell
To touring globes
Getting fucked
Opening hate mail
And they said I'd never be shit
Now I see more
Than they ever going to peep shit
Feed my money till my belly looking bloated
I see the future sugar coated

[Hook: Louie Knuxx] (x4)
The more faded I get
The more you see these dollar signs
In my eyelids
(And what I'm looking at?)

[Verse 2: Diaz Grimm]
The more faded I get
The more my mind grows
It's bigger than the physical
I'm seeing with my eyes closed
Three eyes wide
I'm on that level seven boy
Visioning real life
Seeing through the decoys
I see dollar signs though
If it help my bankroll
Free-up time of work
Help my older self evolve
Money money money
Greedy generation growing
Can I blame them for their want?
Banks be lending, so we owing
So I'm stacking on my own
Ask my wallet how it's going
Kids asking will I
I will son, owing
Dollar signs for my parties
Dollar signs for my true views
Punch above my weight
Use my Knuxx, just like Lou use
First feature with an OG
Better fucking get to know me
Take the whole seven gang
Because I heard the fucking top is lonely
(Yeaaaah)
Just tell me where the cash is
So I can afford to travel the world
For answers

[Hook] (x4)

[Verse 3: PNC]
The more faded I get
The more paper making
Schemes of generating
Growing into generation
Of dog eat dog
Watch your bitches lez
And I'm taping it
Dog eat dog
Me and Knuxx collaborating
It's god meets god
Go to church
Read up about us
We're bad as some fucking killers
I'm not talking brand of flowers [?]
I'm talking do anything
For the money, power, respect
I'm talking go at the neck
To see more O's in the cheque
[?] depositories
Mad hoes that adore me
You say you keeping it real
I see mad holes in your story (Yeah)
Fuck surviving
It's go for glory or dying
If you predict that I'm [?]
Surprise bitch, you dead wrong
Watch me bake the bread long
My psyche like Karrine Steffans, headstrong
Mindset is on fucking with the Rutherfords
Weather with the rhymes [?] crimes
Lets get the money bitch

[Outro: Louie Knuxx] (x2)
Son of a bitch
It's a dog's life ain't it
Me and the money
We have never been acquainted
Six million ways you could obtain it
But when you got it, then it ain't shit

I got a stick and some lint to my name
I got some shit on the low due to fame
I got this rapping and my habits to support
It's either that or there's a mission to abort
