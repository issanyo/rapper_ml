[Verse 1 - David Dallas]

Yeah, yeah

Here we go with the same old shit
Lames always seem to run their lame old lips
And be way more equipped to forget their own lives
Payin' way more attention to shit that do not concern them a little bit
What a bitch
Call it a conundrum
Feel like U-40, out here tryna' function
Play like M.J wanna beast out of something
Cos they call the cops when someone wanna punch them (man...)
Swear they playin' Russian Roulette
Shit talk hasn't made you cool yet
Ain't been in a room yet with me at the same time
Stop sayin' what I said like you ain't lyin'
You were never there man, what the fuck would you know
Push you out of our circle, that's sumo
Shit is like Fight Club, you should know the rules though
Yeah

[Hook - David Dallas]

Get up off my dick
No joke, no joke
Don't go thinkin' you know who the fuck I am
Off the second hand store from your man
Get up off my dick
No joke, no joke
Don't go thinkin' you know what the fuck this is
Nose all up in my bizz
Shit, get up off my dick

[Verse 2 - PNC]

Once again, it's the brother gold flow
Livin' like there's no tomorrow
This the Kobe and LeBron show
Who the fuck you tryna' guard bro
Tell em all I can push it like ?
My name is my name
Don't belong in your mouth though
Frontin' like you got the clout ho
Heard you can't even run your own household
And if your life was an album, this would be the outro (gone bitch...)
Should of been a little cautious
Bitches slick talk about the bosses
Better check your whack off-brand wrists watches
Know what time it is cos I'm coming with the monsters
To fuck up your clique
Bunch of clowns in a circus
'bout to get surrounded by nurses
Cos I hit like Sonny Bill on the perches
See my on the real
You be clutchin' at the purses
Sucker you're shut
I'm seein' through the smoke and mirrors
Tryna' come at me you serious
When you're life is a comedy of varies
Told your wife she need to come over here and get on this dick
Gave her a bottle and she necked it
Yea she courteously accepted
I hit again and pointed to the exit
Damn my man should've never disrespected
Get off my dick

[Hook - David Dallas]

Get up off my dick
No joke, no joke
Don't go thinkin' you know who the fuck I am
Off the second hand store from your man
Get up off my dick
No joke, no joke
Don't go thinkin' you know what the fuck this is
Nose all up in my bizz
Shit, get up off my dick

[Verse 3 - David Dallas]

Cos you don't know shit
From clay, dont play, get up outta my way
It's a dictatorship
Mother-fuck your say, all fuckin' day
You're a couch potato
Tryna' comment on the play
Tryna' comment on the greats
This ain't Newstalk ZB
This is not up for debate, I'm stepping to the plate
You better start stepping on your breaks
Slow on the up-take, fallin' for the pump-fake
And you're soft as a cupcake
You probably still getin' told off for stayin' up late
I just do a one-take, harder than a ?
Straight with the bars
Back-seat driver, never paid for a car
Even when it has been
Knew it never was
Bitch get up off my dick

[Hook - David Dallas]

Get up off my dick
No joke, no joke
Don't go thinkin' you know who the fuck I am
Off the second hand store from your man
Get up off my dick
No joke, no joke
Don't go thinkin' you know what the fuck this is
Nose all up in my bizz
Shit, get up off my dick
