[Chours]
I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin, or floatin, a Brougham is what I'm sportin
Sade is in my tape deck, I'm movin in slow motion boi
I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin, or floatin, a Brougham is what I'm sportin
Sade is in my tape deck, I'm movin in slow motion boi

[Verse 1 Jordache]
Slow motion through the streets that I grew up on
Got drunk and threw up on
Like fuck Lion Red I swear I'm never drink again
I'd rather get high again better think again
Coz' next week you right back to it
Nah I'm drinking straight Sprite you better spike that fluid
Despite that spewin'
And the ice keep the beers on chill
Playing Sade, Hard aye! Yep for real
As we rolling out the hills on course for the city
Goodbye to Heineys Bonjour to the Whitneys
Heres a number you can hit me on
Roll a joint bro forget the bong and pour some liquor that'll get me gone
So now im hazed and I'm boozed
Feeling like Mitch from Dazed and Confused
Lookin' at the older dudes
Like they Matthew McConaughey
We just some gonners aye
And Aquemini Track 8 is all I wanna play cause

[Verse 2 PNC]
Stayin Blas√© on a Friday Faded
Playin Sade or Sade's Greatest
Smooth operaters yeah we're top rated
Laying in the weather where you hear the cicadas
Club overpaid us and I'm bout to drop it all on a new pair that came out
The Decade I was born so
Check the status no check the status though
Either way you say this I'mma still remain the baddest yo
Before I had the flow, I was slick daddy'o
Back when I was drawing pictures on my grans patio
Chasing women with the fanny ??and the nudy teens??
