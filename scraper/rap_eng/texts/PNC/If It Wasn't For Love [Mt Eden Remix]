[Verse 1]
Dark clouds in the bright lights
Cheap women pay the high price
Passed out on the rock and roll
End up familiar with the so and so's
Packed shows full of the unanimous
Seeing black crows, feeling ominous
Take the solace in a bottle
You can bet that its on again tomorrow
You can bet
A repeat of original sin
In the home of the Devil might as well move in
Moving like The Walking Dead
We got the virus
We need supplies to ignite us for the night
It's what we do, huh, how you doing Bruh?
I need Jack and Jim to get thru bruh
And I am back in the mindset
Can you really risk it all when there is nothing at stake?
Wait...

[Verse 2]
If it wasn't for the Love I was showing now
Could have been another two meters below with a
Tombstone reading, "Gone to soon though"
Any minute I can see my final moon glow
Any minute trying to live it like the world's got a comet about to hit it and we're done for every cynical night in a dark space
I know that I can make it to a sun-rise
See myself in the eyes of a daughter or a son before I can take flight
To the spiritual or the ship you left weighing you down, It's nothing to take light
I take Pride
Like a lion when he leads
Never trying to appease
Please It's fight time rather die standing on these
Nike's than living the life on my knees Until then...
