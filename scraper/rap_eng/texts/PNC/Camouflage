[Verse 1]

Pull out the bag, kick the plate up
I’m on the track, kick the plate up
Pull out the bag, kick the plate up (yeah)
I’m on the track, kick the plate up
I’m twisted up
The liquor’s in my arteries
Kitchen top looking similar to pharmacies
They ran their mouth
Now we’re finding out the talk's tall
I’m coming out
That means fire for your aux cord
I see their clips
So all I’m hearing is my son’s flow
But fuck the kids
All I care is that my funds grow
Who got the codes
Let’s reel it on a laptop
I run the game since the days I had a mascot (what’s up)
No introduction needed
My circumference undefeated
Every hand I play is royal flush
And then I just repeat it
Beat em to death in fact
I hit like Stephen stepping back
We still about our cash money
You better put respect on that
Rappin' that gruesome music
And it's Patrick who produced it
Do this on my own
You know I never had to super-group it
New shit to flood the net
I been through hell but nonetheless
I still telling my tale until my body fail and come to rest

[Chorus]
On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
Yeah we on our way to Mars
We all fully charged
With our whole entourage at the bar
Dressed in camouflage

On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
Yeah we on our way to Mars
We all fully charged
With our whole entourage at the bar
Dressed in camouflage

[Verse 2]
Come off the rip and I'm 'bout it
We pursue the payday, while some wait
And ain't shit for me to stay grounded
Only move that they make is a pump-fakes
I got a real one standing adjacent
With immaculate swag of an actress
Then look at the girls that you’re chasing
Either ratchet, bat-shit or catfish
We’re in the habitat getting drunk
That Jameson about to sink in
Big bag of caps in the trunk
Not gonna feel my face for the weekend
Try looking in the eyes of a killer
But us guys in the pass I smoke
They'll tell you like Bryson Tiller (dope)
I am the plug
Rhythm, methods of distribution
Music is the drug
We been a New Zealand institution
Rhyming out my mind
Since I signed up with Dirty Records
And about the time I hit Thirty
Moved into independence
That is called codes
Shout out to Jordan and to Amon
We're in God mode
You other rappers can't turn your game on
Damn I need a charge
Somebody pass a pill already
On my way to Mars
And our garments like the military's

[Chorus]
On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
Yeah we on our way to Mars
We all fully charged
With our whole entourage at the bar
Dressed in camouflage

On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
Yeah we on our way to Mars
We all fully charged
With our whole entourage at the bar
Dressed in camouflage

[Outro]
On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
On my way to Mars
Whole squad dressed in camouflage
