[Hook - PNC]

One-two and it's on
When we come through they keep it movin' along
As you can see no tattoos on our arm, nah
Cos' the demeanor speaks volumes
And all their songs went like Kobe and LeBron
Kobe and LeBron
See you don't wanna play with a god, uh
Went like Kobe and LeBron
Kobe and LeBron
See you don't wanna play with a god, nah

[Verse 1 - PNC]

Kobe and LeBron, no-one's beatin' that
You rumored to be the best, I don't see the facts
Used to ride a BMX, do a bunny-hop
Now I'm coming at your throat like the money shot
Pause
Flow all roids, it's like I'm on some cheatin' shit
Designer wear yeah, always in the cleanest shit
These label chumps used to talk up some demeanor shit
Now they on that we should do brunch have a meeting shit
Fuck outta' here you cowards get the treatment
We treat to linin' up for clubs that we frequent
We leave with that thing you look like you can't breath
Kobe and LeBron shit, I should wear an arm sleeve
I should wear a ring now
I out-play the field
Rappers say they soldiers, I guess that I'm a Navy Seal
Haters still be crumblin' over nothin'
Stuntin' hard
And not ever recovering from concussion
On the production I beast
Fuck a track list, call my shit the deceased
Chasin' the dope chicks straight in the chalice
Don't talk shit then run straight to the police
Never that
Play at a level that they only aspire too
Rentin' the fire raps, fightin' who's a curiae too
Flying through the air, these suckers struggle for playing time
Kobe and LeBron, David Stern, the game is mine

[Hook - PNC]

One-two and it's on
When we come through they keep it movin' along
As you can see no tattoos on our arm, nah
Cos' the demeanor speaks volumes
And all their songs went like Kobe and LeBron
Kobe and LeBron
See you don't wanna play with a god, uh
Went like Kobe and LeBron
Kobe and LeBron
See you don't wanna play with a god, nah

[Verse 2 - David Dallas]

Yeah
Feelin' like a young Kobe, the one-and-only
Half the shack left to May, Pat Riley is homie
Tell these motherfuckers blow me, you won't dethrone me
Zone D in Double OT you couldn't hold me
At home or out on the roadie
Staple center or the guard
And I'm in the Zone G
So just throw me the rock
I'm about to go deep into the play-offs
Cheerin' for the other team, call that shit a seance
You talkin' to your dead homies
I'll pull one out for them cos' the top's gettin' lonely
Get on my Bobby Brown shit
Snatch a tenderoni
Ain't nothin' phony
Call me King James, what they doin' is below me
The one (the number one)
Ain't no actor
I'm my prime you would not motherfuckin' factor
Team work make the dream work but here's the thing
Show me a team without a superstar that won a ring
I'm the one

[Hook - PNC]

One-two and it's on
When we come through they keep it movin' along
As you can see no tattoos on our arm, nah
Cos' the demeanor speaks volumes
And all their songs went like Kobe and LeBron
Kobe and LeBron
See you don't wanna play with a god, uh
Went like Kobe and LeBron
Kobe and LeBron
See you don't wanna play with a god, nah
