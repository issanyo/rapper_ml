Can we get a motherfuckin moment of silence, for the small chronic break?
A-hah, niggas be brown-nosing these hoes and shit
Takin bitches out to eat, and spendin money on these hoes, knowhatI'msayin?
I treat a bitch like 7-Up I never have I never well
I tell a bitch like this
Bitch, you without me is like Harry Melvin without Bluenotes
You'll never go platinum
Hey Daz, give me a light nigga
