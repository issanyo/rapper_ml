[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Doggin' em
Hah ah uh ah uh
Here we go

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Now, I bring you up and then you bring me down
Now how you gonna clown the top dogg in the pound
Girl, my repertoire is far above far
See when you roll with Doggy Dogg, baby, you roll like a star
Plus sees, you eats swell 7 days of the week
I take you from the streets to the sweets, now you a super freak
With brothers on your jock now, word around town
Baby girl, got the platinum pay now
And everybody want to hit it
It's so hard to hold on to it once you get it
Now that I got it, I'm in a twist, now I'm fallin' in love
I told the homies I ain't hangin' out, fuck the club
'Cause I'm payin' rent and cookin' her dinner
I'm feelin' like a loser when I know I'm a winner
I'm snippin', trippin', caught in a love maze
My mama used to say it be days like this, mane

[Verse 2: K-Ci]
Isn't it funny the things you said and done to me?
You said you want me but now lady, I wanna be free
You lied to me, you said you never would play me
But I found out that you were lying all the time

[Chorus: Both]
Girl, you pick me up (ooh)
And you bring me down (hey)
When I thought I found in you solid ground (oh)
You turn my smile into a frown (hey, yeah, baby)
Girl, you promised that you'd never let me down (you make me say oh)
And now you're not around
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (yeah)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
They say pimpin' ain't easy, but it's a whole load of fun
Unless you gettin' pimped and you ain't the only one
She had me drankin', smokin', losin' my mind
Outta control, I had to slow my role
I was rollin' in the fast lane, fuckin' with a Lois Lane
Thought I was the Superman, but I'm the Snoopaman
It wasn't no need for me to be frownin'
And it wasn't no need for her to keep clownin'
Effect for jo jackin' chips stacks none
Keep it on the low low, K-Ci & JoJo
Brought me up so I can bring you down
'Cause we known for slappin' hittos, in case you didn't hear though
What you do about little, we do about bigger
Back off 'cause these is my niggas
Put my finger on the ground, put a G on the pound
If you niggas can't swim, well she bound to drown

[Verse 4: JoJo]
When I was up, girl, you brought me down
Played me like a clown, you thought I'd stay around
So you could, you could abuse me, take my heart and use me
And you see I'm still around for your talk and for your smile

[Chorus: Both]
You pick me up (You pick me up)
And you bring me down (Same time you bring me down)
When I thought I found in you solid ground (I thought I found in you solid ground)
You turn my smile (oh oh oh oh)
Into a frown (Baby)
Girl, you promised that you'd never let me down (ooh oh oh oh)
And now you're not around
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (bring it down)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
