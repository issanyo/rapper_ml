[Rap Verse: Snoop Dogg]
I'm smokin'
All up in the club
I'm gettin' what I want with the Landi in my cup
I'm wantin' more than one, I'm all by the bar
I'm in it for a second
The moment
The minute
Today and tomorrow
I'm in it for the ball
And she is, too, see, cause she all up on the Dogg
This is what I'm gon' do, ball til I fall
Me and Mya
In the back of the party
Gettin' love by everybody
Gettin' higher
The ladies just love, Snoop D-O-Doub'
They say I walk just like
And my talk is light
Matter fact, I live the boss' life

Repeat Chorus 1
