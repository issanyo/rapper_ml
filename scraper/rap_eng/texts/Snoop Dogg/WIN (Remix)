[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
A nigga been winning for a long time
With a strong mind and I own mine
You can check my motherfuckin' pedigree
On my chest is the letter C, poetically
So inclined, genuine, suspicious lies
Your bitch is mine and in due time
You'll see that I am certified and intertwined
Cover two like a cornerback
Yeah, loc' I need the corner back
I'm on it, I want it, I get it
LeBron with the Late Show, we get it
Imperialistic, magic mystic
Aaron Donald with the helmet lipstick
I don't lose, in case you missed it
Facts on facts, check my statistics
Don Dada, Doggfather
Drip on a bitch like cold water
Me and my niggas we known to cut up
Slice the bread, cut the butter
Pop the pain, roll the bud up
All of my niggas and bitches, what up?
All of my cousins crippin', throw it up
Wuh-wuh-win, nigga I ain't stutter

[Chorus: Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar, & Snoop Dogg]
Get out the way, get out the way, get out the way, yeah
Get out the way, get out the way, get out the way, yeah(yeah)
Get out the way, get the fuck up out my way, yeah
Get out the way, get the fuck up out my way, yeah (yeah)
You either with me or against me, ho
You either with me or against me, ho (ho)
You either with me or
You either with me or (wait)
Win, win, win, win, win
Win, win, win, win, win (yeah)
Fuck everything else, win, win, win, win (win)
These niggas ain't shit (mommy), win, win, win, win
Stop chasin' that bitch (stop), win, win, win, win (yeah)
