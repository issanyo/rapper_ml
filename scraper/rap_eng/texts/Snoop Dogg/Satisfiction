Simple pleasures, rockstar living
Drugs and mansions, hit the ceiling
Cars expensive, blow this action
True revealing - satisfiction

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, I mean, I listen to these rap records
Half the time I'm suspicious
You niggas sound so fictitious
Believe me, I know the difference
I got some words for you niggas
You're the definition of (satisfiction)
Listen up, I been where you're going three times and plus
Big houses, cars, jewelry, bad bitches all around us
Motherfucker uh, I seen it all and guess what
It's the (Satisfiction) you feel me?

[Verse 2: King Mez]
Oh yeah, oh I see what you're saying
I know some niggas just like that
Frontin' ass niggas man, really ain't got no bucks like that
Stuck like that, its cool if you cool with gettin' love like that
Flashin' down the Southside Raleigh
You'll be runnin' outta luck like that
What I mean by that is
Why your name always in these rental records?
Spendin' rent money gettin' that bottle service into your section
You leased your car, leased your house, leased your spouse
Know she leavin' if you run outta paper
And might be smashin' your neighbor
I know you think you're a star cause followers clickin'
Guess your ambition is to keep up with social tradition
Like sneaker shoppin' some of you niggas is fuckin' sickenin'
Cause you'll take your soul out, just so you can fit in

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Cuz, fuck wrong with these niggas?
These labels always askin' me to do a song with these niggas
Doc, I think its time for you to open up the pharmacy nigga
And change this fuckin' music shit my nigga, you should consider
Nah, I've been doin' me lokin, keepin' these bad bitches open
And keeping them wet yep, see cuz Long Beach right by that ocean
Still sippin' that gin and juice my nigga, yep I'm still on that potion
And all these random niggas fake as fuck and I'm still gettin' noticed
God damn man, how we 'sposed to handle this shit, cuh
Everything we built these niggas done dismantled this shit, cuh
We gotta get back to that real, that's on the dub
Another lesson from your uncle Snoop, what what what?

[Bridge: Dr. Dre & (Marsha Ambrosius)]
(I'm just stating the facts
Don't get no realer than that
Satisfiction, attention, listen, play your position, player)
Shouldn't be too hard my nigga
It's supposed to be like a lay up
Shouldn't be so hard to be yourself
My nigga wake up
Stay up, pay up, straight up, cake up
Thats what I'm made of, high? Yup
My life is all authentic, that's why I'm goin' way up
Your satisfaction fictitious, your happiness is made up
