[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
(My life, my life, my life, my life)
Oh, another day to play
(My life, my life, my life, my life)
(My life, my life, my life, my life)
Dam Funk take me away
(My life, my life, my life, my life)

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
In my life time, in my life time
I gon' get mines, oh yeah
Living the gangsta life
In the life time
Drinking and smoking yeah
In my life time

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Fish don't burn in the kitchen
And beans don't burn on the grill
Gs don't turn nor squeal
Took a whole lot to get up that hill
But a lotta homies got popped and peeled
Copped the steel, two-one Glock in the building
Two in a million probably a billion
Nobody can feel you
Wait for the moment to brake
Cause I know a lot of niggas want a piece of my cake
Here's a candle, now blow on it
I got the eight, seven, six, five, four on it
Make up the price, shake up the dice
I'm tryna get rich overnight despite
Four or five killers on the spot that are mad
Whoopin the back, rockin the sack
Walk in the back, cockin' it back
Cause I don't know who to trust
I'm with them, six-one boys yelling "east side buck"

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
In my life time, in my life time
I gon' get mines, oh yeah
Living the gangsta life
In the life time
Drinking and smoking yeah
In my life time

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Ayo I see them in my vision it's clear nigga, with my locs on
Riding through your hood in an all coke white bronc
Living what you suckas dreaming, new team
DPG we get that new cream
Dolla, dolla bill and reek on the ship
In my life time nigga I flinch and ain't sweat
I'm connected with the connect, that get's stumped up
Respect that get stripped butt naked, tell him the homie said it
It's official like a forty-five with a reserve
I'mma get you, anyone else with you
Bad bitch they can get you
When it comes to the crew DPG, Kurupt, Daz, and Snoop
Burn rubber nothing but smoke like Dillin hoes
This is the way we living everyone suppose
We can just my life, my life, my life in the sunshine
Motherfucker I'mma get mine, cause I...

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
In my life time, in my life time
I gon' get mines, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Daz Dillinger]
I'm like yabadabadoo my nigga

Hella fly, hella lit, hella bent
Hella spin 7 Days of Funk shit
Got a rocket in my pocket
Should I peel a gorilla some reveal it
I conceal it, these niggas really gon' feel it
If you gon' play them game then we gon' spray them Ks
Got homies everywhere that's prepared and trained
In and out of state hitting hard like freight train
Cause it ain't nothin' but that dog pound gangsta gang
I'm a minute a way from getting this sending to Ye
Sitting and spitting for days
Vantaging, vicious, militias my nigga
This is the prince and I got a princess on the hoe stroll
Hoeing for a nigga, playing no games, bitch go in for a nigga
