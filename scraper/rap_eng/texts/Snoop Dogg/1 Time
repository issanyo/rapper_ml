[Hook: Jacquees]
It go one time for the money
Two times for the show
Three times cause I'm 3-0
And I keep me a bankroll
And I got me hella hoes
And I'm having hella clothes
And I bang Rich Gang to the core
Turn my ruby stone to a charm
It go one time for the money
Two times for the show
Three times cause I'm 3-0
And I keep me a bankroll
And I got me hella hoes
And I'm having hella clothes
And I bang Rich Gang to the core
Turn my ruby stone to a charm

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Money, bitches, wreck the car
Hit that pussy and I left a scar
Check the yard, spector RTLBC we setting the bar
Aretta, I met her, forgive her, I lead her, I let her
I find em, I fuck em, replace em, forget em
Flip the look, game on game I script the book
Well heard but seldom seem
Down in Mississippi and New Orleans
Motherfuckas know about the D-O dub not he on buzz
Not he on drugs and she on cuz
DJ Khaled aqui on cuz
IG on dubs, pee on rugs, true dog nigga with the motherfuckin mean old mug
Ooh wee, Count that
Brand new bitch on the bounce back
Lower that, nigga been waiting on more of that
Throw it back, two or more, three or four
VIP, can't take no more
G shit through my speakers
And twenty hoes on my [?]

Yeah, one for the money, two for the show, Its three ways to do this
Stunna, Jacquees, Snoop Dogg

[Hook: Jacquees]
It go one time for the money

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Pull up in my new ride
Valet parked her outside
Hundred chips, hundred dimes
Stunna man I'm the dime
You ain't did what I did ya dig
You ain't feed the project ya dig
You know me a born high roller
You know me will take it off ya shoulder
Money too long to be worryin about you
Hit the gate, bust a five, me and my slimes come through
Bugatti bloody red, uptown till I'm dead
Cash Money, master plan ya dig what I'm sayin

[Hook: Jacquees]
It go one time for the money

[Verse 3: Jacquees]
I'm the youngin I'm the beast
I'm the king of the east
I got swag I got steez
I got cash I got keys
I'm on the road getting a bag prolly spend it on a Jag
And I'm in love the head that's why I'm throwing all the cash
Aye I'm the one that you should mention, I need some more recognition
Niggas thinkin they in love I'm in they bitch mouth like a dentist
Stunna passed me the keys I turned the game by the ignition
My jewelry so bright see this shit here from a distance

[Hook: Jacquees]
