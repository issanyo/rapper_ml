[Intro:]
Do it, Do it
Lemme do my thang
Cause I'mma do my thang
Lemme do my thang
(Do your natural thang)
Can I do my thang
Let me do my thang

[Hook:]
Stay on the low
And get it everywhere that we go
Let me do my thang
New gators on my feet
Rolling up and down the street
Let me do my thang
I bust a new batch
Get it back just like that
Let me do my thang
I'm hard in the paint, never say what a nigga can't
Do my thang, Do my thang, yeah imma do my thang
Let me do my thang

Stay on the low
And get it everywhere that we go
Lemme do ma thang
New gators on my feet
Rolling up and down the street
Lemme do my thang
Keep it on the low, and get it everywhere that we go
Lemme do my thang

[Verse 1]
Get a bitch, got a bitch
G shit, yeah I got a lot of it
Money up, nah money back
And I don't tolerate none of that (shut up)
Have a seat and enjoy
And roll with your muthafuckin home boys
Dam-funk, drive the car
I'm smoking the [?] right by the bar

Do my thang, yeah I'mma do my thang

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
One two, one two
Me and Dam, came to funk you
I know you love everythang that we does
Now this shit bangin' in the club
And ain't no need to procrastinate
We on the forty yes my nigga and i passed the eight
And let me get [?] back to the floor
Life when i was a young G back in '84

(Oh, no) Do ma thang, yeah I'mma do ma thang

[Hook]

Greetings nebulons

You are now ordered to do your thang
Oh no
Your thang is your thang
Only you can do you
So do it, do it, do it
