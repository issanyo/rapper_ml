[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screamin' that's nothin'
When I pulled off the lot: that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamond, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Big Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa
See on the West Coast I'm the big chiefa
The Grim Reaper, maybe that
Bring me back, yellow 'Lacs, Steeler logo in the back
We bangin' out, that Taylor Gang
Dub to your face, baby 'til you say my name
Don't get your clique served, so much black and yellow
You would think I was from Pittsburgh, in turn, get your'n

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I'm a bumblebee lit up like a Christmas tree
Drinkin' Hennessey Black, I'm from Tennessee
Juicy J make the way on my own two
Quarter mil' for the Phantom, bitch I own you
And they go for e'ry chick that I'm fuckin' with
Black and yellow bitches all up on me, yeah I dig
In they purse, gotta get that reimburse
On them bills and that purple pint of syrup
And I stay Louis'd down to the socks
Rings and watch, weed and Glock
My pants swole with them rubber band knots
I'm gettin' old but them rubber bands not, nigga

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah I do it big

Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Catch me in my Lamborghini, black and yellow, black and yellow
I can rock it on the beat or (a cappella, a cappella)
Uh-uh, sideways in the turning lane
Fire flame, I be burnin' mane
Teddy Pain 'bout to hurt the game
Took a break for a while, I been learnin' things
I learned how to tell a nigga "Fuck you then"
Black and yellow, black and yellow, all I do is fuckin' win
I told y'all, and now I'm on
You thought it was over, you thought I was gone
I'm goin' in, you gon' have to let me, have to let me
Back from the dead like I'm Makaveli, Makaveli

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screamin' that's nothin'

Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamond, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Black and yellow, all black and yellow
See me now they treatin' me like I'm somebody special
Smokin' on that good, know it's me soon as they smell it
You could chill, I'm the one who get it, not the one who sellin'
All grind every day, I'm ballin', I can't help it
Niggas on that bullshit, my pockets full of Celtics
And them niggas hatin' on us, get our best wishes
In the club you ain't even on the guest list, bitch
Sound like you need to get your weight up
Go to sleep rich and count another million when I wake up
They wonderin' how I do my thing
Two words: Taylor Gang
Remix, G-shit
This champagne's poured, nigga the weed's lit
Lil mama's clothes fallin' like the leaves in the fall
Ain't worried 'bout your friends so bring 'em all

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screamin' that's nothin'
When I pulled off the lot: that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamond, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
