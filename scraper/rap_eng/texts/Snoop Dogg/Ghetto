[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Whats crack-a-lackin, baby girl?
You know I keep it ghetto fabulous everyday
Yep, in a real way, hey, hey, hey
Look, now what would a girl like you do wit a G like me?
You probably couldn't handle it
I'll pop a bottle and get a few candles lit
Now the scene is set as we sip on some Moet

[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland]
Rock your Timbs, sag your jeans
Ice your grill, it is all good with me
Twenty-fours, big four doors
I have no doubt, I'm down to roll

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
I love it
The way you talk to me
Love it
And your walk is mean
Love it
You know how I like it, boy

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & Snoop Dogg]
Ghetto, so ghetto

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
Hit your block, check your spot
If the block is hot, lay up in the spot, baby
Roll your dice, get your cash
