[Intro: Tyrion]
A Lannister always pays his debts

[Verse 1]
The line in the roads, breakers of the chains
Sport of the lord, war of five kings
Lords of the rock sitting on the iron throne
Betrayal, revenge, murder, now his mind's gone
The trial 'bout to happen, he smile while he cracking
For real cause he ready for that action
Rich, wealthy and sinister
Welcome to the house of the Lannisters

[Hook](x2)
Honour thy lord, swing my sword
Servant of war
We got the power
Seven kingdoms strong (welcome to the house of the Lannisters)

[Break: Joffrey]
Kneel. Kneel before your king. KNEEL!

[Verse 2]
He won this game, king with the crown
Go against Joffrey and he'll cut your ass down
So sick but it's slay shit
Debt-payers, pay your dues or you will get dealt with
So much to see, blood in the streets
Incest laying with your blood in the sheets
Pop it, drop it like you wanna leave
Honour, not much amongst these thieves

[Verse 1]

[Hook](x2)
