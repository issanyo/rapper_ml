[Refrain]
On my knees, all my life I’ve been sold a chase
Hustling hope for dollars, try cope a day (a day)

[Verse 1]
Under condition
We on our way to the top
We got the world at our fingers
We make the penny drop
Gotta get in and get outta the gate
I won't stop 'til I wake
I'll say it loud 'til I mean it
Talk like I be the Messiah

[Chorus]
When I'm on top, I'm on top, I'm on top of the world
See me run, see me run, see me run with the girls
I'm on top, I'm on top, I'm on top of the world
Need a break, then I'll take to the top of the world

[Refrain]
On my knees, all my life I’ve been sold a chase
Hustling hope for dollars, try cope a day (a day)

[Verse 2]
Euphoria
I missed you like a new treasure
We go so good together
Search all my life to find better
But I won't hold my breath
I'll just fill up and deliver
They got attention deficit
I wait for the good lord to visit (Mary, Mary)

[Bridge 1]
All my life turned to dust
No one knew who to trust
Had a chance for a good life

[Verse 3]
See me on tele
See me on billboards and banners
See me white picket fences
Now watch me build up my palace (ha ha ha)
Now out on the run, you'll see me gathering martyrs
Won't forget where I started when we would (pray from the gutters)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on top, I'm on top, I'm on top of the world
Send me up, send me up with the diamonds and pearls
I'm on top, I'm on top, I'm on top of the world
And they can talk, they can talk, but I got the good word

[Bridge 2]
And it's crazy, undefined, brand new
It's amazing I got high on a view
But tonight I'm feeling tired and alone
Dear Lord, I hope we didn't go wrong

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
I’m at the rippy tippy top of this
And really there’s no stopping this
So I’m gon’ keep on popping this
As long as y’all keep rocking this
This ESPN, freshian
And I got the best hand
You married to the game
So I guess I am your best man
Lemme talk to ya
Lemme break it down for a second baby
Are you listening?
Attention, I need it baby
See God can place you
With the angels, fly around in ease
Top of the world with the Dogg
Now baby feel the breeze

[Bridge 3]
We prayed from the gutters
Like martyrs we followed you
Prayed from the gutters
Like martyrs we followed you

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm on top, I'm on top, I'm on top of the world
(We pray from the gutters)
See me run, see me run, see me shout what I heard
(Like martyrs, we followed you)
I'm gonna shine, I'm a shrine from the top of the world
(Pray from the gutters, like martyrs we followed you)

[Refrain]
On my knees, all my life I’ve been sold a chase
Hustling hope for dollars, try cope a day (a day)

[Outro]
Uphill, I'm winning
Not concerned if I'm cheating
They built me up to be beaten
They built me up to be beaten
