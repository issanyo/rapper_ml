[Intro]
Yeah, what's happening?
This one is dedicated to my niggas
All my niggas out there, G's up, hoes down

[Verse 1]
Ladies and gents, playas and pimps listen
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the mic, pay attention
One, two, oh what shall I do?
I'm slipping on my khaki suit (Which one?)
The blue one, gun by my side as I mob to the beach
On a mission and I'm fishing for my DJ Warren G
Now I look for the bud sack
And see where my loves at on the lake where the doves at
Cognac is the drink that's drank by G's
Sagging like a mothafucka, khakis to they knees
Bitch please, you know how we do the undercover
I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg, not your average motherfucka, see

[Hook]
Some of you don't know about the G thang, baby
It's the smooth gangsta shit that be driving ya crazy
Now as ya groove to the beat and ya move to the sound
I'mma hit ya up with the Pound, G's up, hoes down
(Well, all the real G's, please stand up and let all be accounted for
And if you don't give a fuck about a bitch, then you're rolling with the Row)

[Bridge]
Back with the one, two, three, and to the fo'
It's the S-N, O and to the O, P
(Why am I so fly?) I don't know, but
(Why am I so high?) It's the Indo

[Verse 2]
I don't fuck with the pocus, everbody knows this
Fucking with the Chronic, cause the Chronic gives me dopeness
Now focus your eyes on these, follow me
As I take ya rolling with the real OG's
East Side is the motherfuckin' place, known as home
Doggy Dogg with my bone in my hand, twenty grand and

[Hook]
Some of you don't know about the G thang baby
It's the smooth gangsta shit that be drivin ya crazy
Now as ya groove to the G-Funk, and move to the sound
I hit you up with the Pound, Gz Up, Hoes Down
Well, all the real Gz please stand up and
Let all be accounted for, and if you don't give a fuck
About a bitch, then you're rolling with the row

[Outro]
Hell yeah, you know what I'm saying?
This is stricly for the G's, you know I'm saying? Fuck that, bitch
Niggas always handcuffing that ho
When a nigga like me steps in the place
I don't want that ho, I don't love that ho
I'm caught up with my greens
Collard greens, Indo and the cash flow
You know what I'm saying? Peace, G's up, hoes down
