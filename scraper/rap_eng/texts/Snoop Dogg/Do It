[Snoop Dogg]
Geah, uhh
Ain't nothin to it but to do it my nigga
Bigg Snoopy D-O-dub cuz
All up in the club, y'knowmtalkbout?
I see you over there baby girl workin that pole gettin yo' money
I wanna talk to you for a minute
Cause I got this new step I want you to do
Try this shit out one time
And let's see if you can pull this off
Yeah, uhh, uhh

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg] + (woman)
Put your right foot in and your left foot out
Put yo' ass on my dick, that's what I'm talkin about
Work a nigga 'til it feel like I'm 'bout to pass out
Now shaaake, that's what I'm talkin about
Now do it do it do it do it! (How you wanna do it?)
Do it do it do it do it! (How you wanna do it?)
Do it do it do it do it! (How you wanna do it?)
Do it do it do it do it!! (How you wanna do it?)

[Snoop Dogg]
Don't play wit it, let me go and get it
Cause I been watchin it, scopin it, hopin it
Tryna get my hands on it, wanna make you dip
I - wanna make you sip; I - wanna make you flip so, open it
Tip tiptoe out the back do' now meet me there
You can bring a buddy wit'chu bitch, I don't really care
Just make it snappy, I know you're happy
But hurry up before that white bitch come and get at me
When I first stepped foot all up in this place
You shoulda seen all the hooks that was in my face
Talkin 'bout "I can rap, you need to sign me up cuz"
Don't you know I'm in the club tryna find me some girls?
I give a fuck if you can rap nigga, you'll get shot
I ain't fuckin wit'chu wack niggas, so kick rocks
Ay baby boo, come and holla at my crew
And bring your homegirl too, now make it do what it do (do)

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Pick your money up, now pop a pose for me
Freeze (strip!) Mm, take off your clothes for me
Mm.. you're standin there lookin good
.. I see you stuck in the neighborhood
.. And I can tell that the flavor's good
.. And you should do it like I know you should (do it)
You's a go-getter, a real flame-spitter
Twenty-two hoes and all of 'em came wit her
She the baby-sitter, with the kitty litter
She need a dog in her life and D-O-dub bit her
She's so anxious, baby had to stay around
Don't even trip cause you rollin with a player now
And we gon' do it up, until you get enough
I'll get you drunk, take you home and then I'll beat it up
I'll drop you off, pick it up, I need your hair done
So I can stick it up, dick you up, you know what's up

[Chorus]
