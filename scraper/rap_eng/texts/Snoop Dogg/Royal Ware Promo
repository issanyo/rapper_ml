[Intro]
Turn the beat up but turn me down just a little bit
So I can get into this shit real gangsta like, okay

[Hook]
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware

[Verse 1]
I hope it sound good cause I'm in your hood
Big Snoop D-O-dub and I do it so good
I do it fly and I do it so fresh
Don't even trip off the mic cause ya know I'm the best
You ain't gotta judge shit, just kick back
And watch Snoop Dogg grab the mic and rap
I closed my eyes and turned down the light
And spit some shit that's like way tight
Ya never heard a nigga from the L.B.C
Come to pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop Paree
And then do it for you so smooth
To make you muthafuckas jump up and just groove
I got something to prove, I don't lose
When I'm on stage I be draped in blues
They call me the S, so yes ya choose...
The number one rapper cause I love to cruise

[Hook]
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware

[Verse 2]
I make the people just scream and they ooze
They never heard a nigga bring so many blues
I got the rhyme that'll make ya confused
It's Snoop D-O-dub I don't know how to lose
I just win and time and time again...
I blaze up the muthafuckin' chronic with my friends
I'm driving through the streets of papa Paree
And muthafuckas afraid to see me...
Do it on my own cause they know I'm head grown
Bigg Snoop Dogg, I got my hand on my bone
I better keep my hand on my chrome
Cause I ain't home
I don't what these muthafuckas do in they zone
They might try to catch me slippin'
But I'm Snoop Dogg and I'm known for crippin'
I'm known for trippin', I'm known for rippin'
I'm known for whippin' cause I'm so damn different

[Hook]
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware

[Verse 3]
Got sixteen-thousand waitin' on me
They can't wait for the D-O-G
They can't wait for the royal ware
Cause Snoop Dogg's in the house and I just don't care
