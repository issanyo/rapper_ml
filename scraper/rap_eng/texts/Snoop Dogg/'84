[Verse 1: Ro James]
Shorty called in by phone
Said the rent and the bills due, what am I gonna do?
I must abide, deliver
Give me about a week or two
Tryna' get this paper and he said
Sometimes I even feel defeated
Can’t create with all this bullshit on my mind

[Hook: Ro James]
Day and night I’m hustling
Blood and tears to make these ends
They’ll be up, I’m almost close
I can’t give up, I can’t let go, no
Now, it ain’t been easy
But if it were easy it wouldn’t be worth it
If it was smooth like my ’84
If it was smooth like my ’84
If it was smooth like my ’84
If it was smooth like my ’84
Everything would be alright
If it was smooth like my ’84

[Verse 2: Ro James]
Wanna give her the world, says she’s the reason why I’d leave
Wanna make her proud to say that’s my daddy
And when she was old tell the world that I sold my soul to make her happy
Oh, make her happy, yeah

[Hook: Ro James]
Day and night I’m hustling
Blood and tears to make these ends
They’ll be up, I’m almost close
I can’t give up, I can’t let go, no
Now, it ain’t been easy
But if it were easy it wouldn’t be worth it
If it was smooth like my ’84
If it was smooth like my ’84
If it was smooth like my ’84
If it was smooth like my ’84
Everything would be alright
If it was smooth like my ’84

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah. Hey, yo, nephew
Let me halt it baby real quick, man
Check it out baby
Skate slow, ’84, wait for me
Groove so smooth you’ve been hating on me
But I don’t really trip because I’m D.O. double G
The one who put the Jimmy Choo heels on your feet
Slide up the street while I ride to the beat
You cute and petite, but down low you a freak
And I’mma blow you down, slow you down, I’ll show you how
So turn around so I can turn you on the doggy style
This just the fixture, silver satin, you get the picture
Dying to get with you, foot to the floor
Me and my nephew Ro, Ro

[Outro: Ro James]
If it was smooth like my ’84
If it was smooth like my ’84
If it was smooth like my ’84
If it was smooth like my ’84
Everything would be alright
If it was smooth like my ’84
