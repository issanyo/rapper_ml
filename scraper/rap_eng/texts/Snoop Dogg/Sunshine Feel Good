[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two
Peace signs, can ya put 'em up
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two
One time, can ya put 'em up
One, two, one, two
One two, one, two
If ya hear it on the radio, turn it up
Huh, don't front sunshine feelin' real good

[Verse 1: Kim Burrell + Snoop Dogg]
It's just another, just another day that the Lord has (kept me, kept me)
It was no goodness of my own
It was You and You alone
You deserve all the glory
Peace signs in the sky if ya feel good

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Was a time when a storm came in my life
Didn't know which way to turn, to the left or right
Out the corner of my eye, saw a little light
Flickerin' like a flame in the darkest night

[Pre-Chorus: Kim Burrell]
It's almost mornin'
Just let the sun, sunshine in
Sunshine in

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two
Peace signs, can ya put 'em up (can ya put 'em up yeah)
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two
One time, can ya put 'em up
One, two, one, two (one, two, one two, one two)
One two, one, two
If ya hear it on the radio, turn it up
Huh, don't front sunshine feelin' real good

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
A lotta people do me wrong, but I wanna do the right thing (right thing)
Sit back with my pedal on the medal and I'm cruisin' on the highway
While you passin' out blessin's on your people
Lord, shoot a  blessin' my way

[Pre-Chorus: Kim Burrell]
And my good days outweigh my bad days
And I won't complain
You knew from the beginning
That sometimes you might feel alone
But don't look now it's almost...
Mornin'
Just let the sunshine in
The sunshine in yeah
Sunshine in
No-ooo-ooo

[Chorus: Snoop]
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two
Peace signs, can ya put 'em up (can you put 'em up again)
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two
One time, can ya put 'em up (can you put 'em up again)
One, two, one, two
One two, one, two
If ya hear it on the radio, turn it up
Huh, don't front - sunshine feelin' real good

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
You bring the sun out
You bring the sun out, sunshine
You bring the sun out
You bring the sun out, sunshine
Sunshine-ine, sunshine-ine
You bring the sun out
Don't front, you know this sunshine feels good...
In my hood

[Pre-Chorus: Kim Burrell]
There's sometimes you might feel alone
But don't look now, it's almost...
Mornin'
Just let the sun, the sunshine in, the sunshine in
Sunshine in
Ooh-ooaa-oh

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two
Peace signs, can ya put 'em up  (can you put 'em up again)
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two
One time, can ya put 'em up (can you put 'em up again)
One, two, one, two
One two, one, two
If ya hear it on the radio, turn it up
Huh, don't front - sunshine feelin' real good
