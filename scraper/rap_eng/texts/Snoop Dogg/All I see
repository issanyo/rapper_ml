LBC save you
Chillin' with my nephew Butch Cassidy
You know how we do
Rappers at, Coast-to-Coast
Everybody wanna know 'bout LBC thang
And LBC style, And LBC swag

[Butch Cassidy]
I'm chillin' in the LBC
Just about three miles from the CPT
Everybody in the hood loves me
So i gotta do one for the Real OG
I feel it when i flow so deep
So i seren it the world all about this streets
Romeos on fresh pair of Cackys
White T-shirt and a chick named Jacky
We stop at the corner Liquor Store
Just to get some drip and some Blungster Smoke
When I'm in the bitch i feel so good
Cause there's no talking when I'm in my hood
And all that black homies know me
So they throw up the set as I crew so deep
Bouncin' more just ***Some text missing***

[Butch Cassidy]
Everywhere i go
All I see is T-shirts and 'em khakis
Everywhere I be, All I see is T-shirts and 'em khakis
(From the over the sea)
All I see is T-shirts and 'em khakis
(To the CPT)
All I see is T-shirts and 'em khakis

[Butch Cassidy]
All the girls dropping down so long
Cause you take care of me when you hear my song
Holla at me if you want some action
The tip-top form of satisfaction
Just say it
I'll display it busy laid her own girl
Don't delay it
Pipe fitter
Pipe layer
When it comes to laying pipe girl, I'm the nator
And upper that let's keep it OG
True riders bang this in the name of Tookie
Mash out let your pants hang low
When you dope 64 blowing much geddon
IC and RT
Let's all come together cause we're all family
Im an Eastsider G
It's your boy BC from the L-Blue-C

Blaze it up, Long Beach City got y'all amazed with us
City by the sea, I'm a G with sponsors, Loch Ness Monster
Poppin' imposters, mix my shrimp with pasta
