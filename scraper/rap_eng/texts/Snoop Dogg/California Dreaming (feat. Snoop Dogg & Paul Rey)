[Verse 1: Paul Rey]
These palm trees they sway
But each night and each day
I'm California dreaming bout' you
Ah yeah, got this world class view
But it's you that I think about every time when my mind zoning
It's you that I think about every time that I get lonely
It's you that I call on my FaceTime when I need something real
When I work the night shift till' late in the PM
I'm California Dreamin'
You, you, you

[Chorus 1: Paul Rey]
California Dreamin' bout' you
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
California Dreamin' bout' you
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
California Dreamin' bout' you

[Verse 2: Paul Rey]
Ah yeah, not quite right sometimes, cause I...
I've been feeling myself too much
Feeling myself too much
Oh I'm missing you touch
Missing the way you say my name
Hate that I'm away, you know I'd stay
But I got these songs to cut
In the stu' with an empty cup
I've been sipping this drink too much
But God damn, I've been working hard as fuck
And what's work without play in LA ?
I'm California Dreamin'
About you, you, you, you-you, you
One time I tell 'em I'm California Dreamin', Dreamin' Dreamin'
One time I tell 'em I'm California Dreamin', Dreamin' Dreamin'

[Chorus 2: Paul Rey]
[Hook]
Dreamin 'Bout' You, you, you, you, you, you
One time I tell 'em
I'm California Dreamin' Dreamin',  Dreamin'
One time I tell 'em
I'm California Dreamin' Dreamin',  Dreamin' bout
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
California Dreamin, bout you
California Dreamin' Dreamin',  Dreamin' bout
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
California Dreamin, bout you

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Don’t wake me up
Just bake cake me up
And get a whiff of these tasty buds
In HD cuz
I’m thinking bout safes and hugs
I Chase the love
Cheese please, palm trees, breeze
Ease your mind and put cream on it
Lay back relax, now dream on it
What you think, you wanna drink
You want the sea on the shore, make you walk the plank
Skydive, overview
California what a point of view
The weather, whatever endure, your endeavour
If you ride with me baby we can do this forever
In a day, yes sir, ain’t no other way
This is Californ-I-A
Yeah, yeah, dream on dream on

[Outro: Paul Rey]
One time I tell 'em I'm California Dreamin', Dreamin' Dreamin'
California Dreamin' bout' you
California Dreamin', Dreamin'
California Dreamin' bout' you
About you, you, you, you-you, you
California Dreamin' bout' you
