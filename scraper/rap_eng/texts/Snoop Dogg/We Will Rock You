* cover of Queen's song of the same name

What, what
Rock on, rock on

Check this out

Buddy, you a boy make a big noise playin in the streets
Gonna be a big man someday, you got mud on ya face
You big disgrace, I'm kickin ya can all over the place
Sing it

(Chorus) X 2
We will, we will rock you, rock you (Rock on, rock on)

Buddy, you a young man, a hard man, suffering in the streets
Gonna take on the world someday, you got mud on your face
You big disgrace, you moving your banner all over the place
Sing it

(Chorus) X 2

Buddy, you an old man, a poor man, pleading with your eyes
Gonna make ya see someday, you got mud on ya face
You big disgrace, somebody better put you back into ya place
Sing it

(Chorus) X 4
