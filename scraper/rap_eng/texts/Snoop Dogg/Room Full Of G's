Ridin' we G slidin', know its gangstas in here
Ridin' we west sidin', throw yo hands in the air
Know that there's a room full of gangstas
Move in with a room full of gangstas
Blood there's a room full of gangstas
Move in with a room full of gangstas

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
First thing first, Chucks on right
Flag on left, banging my set
2 chicks with me on BC
Don't snort coke or drink no lean
Strap in the purse, they burst first to blast
Can't hit a party with a hefty bag
We are, in a league of our own
If you ain't 'bout that, leave it alone
Cause if it don't turn you on, it'll turn you wrong
Like get the thumper or get the thumpin' alone
Dressed like a sharpshooter, knowing something is wrong
But I don't give a fuck, 20 Crip to the dome

[Hook: Joey Fatts]
Ridin' we G slidin', know its gangstas in here
Ridin' we west sidin', throw yo hands in the air
Know that there's a room full of gangstas
Move in with a room full of gangstas
Blood there's a room full of gangstas
Move in with a room full of gangstas

[Verse 2: Game]
I'm the nigga with 6 valley bitches walking out the teli
You the nigga eating that banana on belly, gay ass nigga
Hair cut like kitty, play ass nigga, I'm a LA ass nigga
Chevy red Impala 6 Tre ass nigga
Walk out the store and don't pay ass nigga
I be at the Tams burger like woo
Tinted windows on the SL Mercedes coupe
King of LA, niggas know I'm with the shit
Let your baby mama suck the crown off my dick
Even my grand mama know I'm a gangbanger
On my way to county jail with my chain hanging feeling like
Fuck these niggas and fuck these bitches
Never tell 'em where I live, I don't trust these bitches
I fuck em in the ally by their momma house
Before a nigga say what's cracking, I pull the llama out
Ain't been scared of shit since I was 12 nigga
West side Bompton yep, I was raised in hell
How I become a blood when my family came up in Nutty Blocc
My uncle cut a nigga throat and it bled while he was cutting rock

[Hook: Joey Fatts]
Ridin' we G slidin', know its gangstas in here
Ridin' we west sidin', throw yo hands in the air
Know that there's a room full of gangstas
Move in with a room full of gangstas
Blood there's a room full of gangstas
Move in with a room full of gangstas
