Patty cake patty cake
With no hands
Got me in this club making wedding plans
If I take pictures while you do your dance
I can make you famous on Instagram
Hot damn it, ooh
Your booty like two planets ooh
Go head, and go ham sandwich
Woah
I can't stand it

Cause You know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bittle

Cadillac, Cadillac, pop that trunk
Let's take a shot
Alley-oop that donk
Tired of working at 9 to 5
Oh baby let me come and change your life
Hot damn it ooh'
Your booty like two planets ooh'
Go head, and go ham sandwich
Woah
I can't stand it

Cause You know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bittle
