Everybody tells me I should walk away
But nothin’ ever felt like this
They say he ain’t right for me
He ain’t the type for me
But I can’t resist
I know that we’re from different worlds
It’s hard for them to see
Maybe I’m crazy but he’s the only one for me

I love him, I love him, I love him
And I don’t care what nobody says
He is mine all mine
And I am his
I love him, I love him, I love him
And everything in me says don’t fight it
When I look into his eyes I know we will be Undivided

People on the outside
Think he’s just a bad boy
They don’t see inside like me
When there ain’t nobody there
He’s like a teddy bear
He treats me like queen
Well he’s got something true and real that
Broke into my heart
And nothin’s ever gonna, gonna tear us apart

I love him, I love him, I love him
And I don’t care what nobody says
He is mine all mine
And I am his
I love him, I love him, I love him
And everything in me says don’t fight it
When I look into his eyes I know we will be Undivided

Slippin' and sliding
Rippin' and riding
Attention Undivided cause I decided
To make amend and make a friend and go all out and rush
To plush
Together forever
And we will never fuss
Blush
Take a picture of a memory
Remember me
We were meant to be
Bad boy, good girl
Perfect combination (like glue)
So much Jubilation
Filled with celebration

I love him, I love him, I love him
And I don’t care what nobody says
He is mine all mine
And I am his
I love him, I love him, I love him
And everything in me says don’t fight it
When I look into his eyes I know we will be Undivided

Everybody needs to find their someone
