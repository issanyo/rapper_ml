[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah wassup my nigga?
I'm sittin here chillin with my nigga Kurupt and we sayin
I mean it ain't no hard motherfuckin whiteboys in the rap game dog
You know? No disrespect (that's right)
That nigga Slim Shady is tight than a muh'fucka though (yeah that's true)
But we want a nigga to come with some GANGSTA shit
You feel me?

[T-Bo]
I went from rags to riches, to hittin these hoes and switches
Duckin snitches, and these money hungry bitches
So you want a dollar? Well baby I can't holla
You ain't gettin' shit from the break-a-bitch collar scholar
Not even a penny, homegirl you ain't gettin any
Oh by the way... you're too fuckin skinny
Why don't you go weep, and wash your stankin ass feet
While my vogues burn, up and down the street
Eatin steak and shrimp, got my name on a blimp
Walk with a limp, cause I'm a motherfuckin pimp
My diamonds is blindin yeah candy paint out shinin
Got yo' bitch chasin me, while yo' old lady two-timin
Whether you mobbin in buckets, or roll in a Benz
Keep yo' eyes on yo' enemies, seperate yo' foes from yo' friends
Fuckin models, drinkin Alize by the bottles
Eleven hundred sixty yachter and my hand's on the throttle

[Hook 2X: Snoop Dogg (paraphrasing Masta Ase "Jeep Ass Niguh")]
White boy, white boy, turn that shit down
You know that America ain't ready for the sound
From dem white boyz.. (white boyz) white boyz.. (white boyz)
White boyz.. (white boyz) white boyz.. (white boyz)

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm high 'n a motherfucker, perv on the curve
Fuckin with this white boy, slangin my herb
D.P.G. to the fullest young cuz
My homeboy Ricky said, "Show me some love!"
He got the club with this fool named T-Bo
From the Dirty South, gold's in his mouth, my peoples
All of my homies from the L.B.C
All my white homies who smoke with me
Sell me bud on the weekdays cause
This shit's for y'all, from me and my doggz
If you don't know you do know T-Bo my new dog
Fuck what you goin through, we bout to fuck it up y'all

[Hook: T-Bo says first line with Snoop] - 1/2X

[T-Bo]
You know who I wanna be, that white boy, that everybody talk about
The one that's tearin up shows, fuckin these hoes, representin the South
Eyes bare-ly open, laid back in the Cadillac tokin
Them hoes talkin bout ridin with me and Snoop the bitches must be jokin
Toke smoke, up the block and Glock stay cocked so you must get busted
And my city's hotter than a corner full of hustlers
Twelve slappin, trunk rattlin, and when you yappin we in a gun battle
When you talkin the talk, we walkin the walk
So stay in yo' house when after dark
You bark and we bite, you're wrong and we're right
Knuckle up in the club to push and shove til everybody starts to fightin
You might think the shit's funny, but fool we ain't actin
You bout that yappin? We bout that action and scratchin
Playin for keeps, screamin take it to the streets
Camouflaged down, with them soles on my feet
And up in the club, thugs push and they shove
And you won't know who's a killer, so you betta watch who you mug

[Snoop Dogg]
Bitch get your mind right, get your mind right
Bitch get your mind right, get your mind right
Yeah, white boyz up in the motherfucker
