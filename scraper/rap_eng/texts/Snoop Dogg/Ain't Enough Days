[Intro: Aaliyah & Future]
Yo, it ain't enough hours in a day (it ain't enough)
It ain't enough days in a week
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yuh-yuh

[Verse 1: Future]
Ain't go to sleep last night, only time I sleep is on the plane
Bought the bitch a Rollie tell time, it ain't enough time in my day
Go Audemars retail price, with that card he get it flooded, cost 200K
2013 Beamer, had it for a year, ain't even drove it over three days
I keep thinkin', last time I seen my grandma (damn)
She just happy just to know I ain't in trouble (I love her)
I been on the road [?] all the covers (yeah)
I been on 'em though, duckin' all the drama (yeah)
I been on the grind, makin' all the commas (yeah)
Then I got sued by my baby mama
I'm tryna find the time, show up at the court case
Man, I already missed four court dates

[Chorus: Aaliyah & Future]
It ain't enough hours in a day (ain't enough hours in a day)
It ain't enough
It ain't enough days in a week (it ain't enough days in a week)
It ain't enough
It ain't enough weeks in a month (no, no, no, no-no, na, aye)
It ain't enough
It ain't enough months in a year (it ain't enough time in a year)
To do it all, it ain't enough

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Clock keeps tickin', it's gettin' so ridiculous
For all my constituents, I'm so conspicuous
Look at this, I'm a G-aah
Look into the future, Snoop and Aaliyah
We-ahh, add it up, take it back, subtract, and reenact
My days up, J's up, to blaze up
Raise up the fleez-ad. half on a beez-ad
501 jeans with the black and gold reez-ag
Who can make a rainbow, I can do the tango
My bloodline is mixed with Django
And the "D" is silent, as they play the violin
I don't wanna walk around in violence, so I pray for peace
It's not enough time, it's quicky, it's tricky
So I guess I better bust mine

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
Don't rock the boat, don't tip the boat over
Drop some game, before it is all over

[Chorus: Aaliyah & Snoop Dogg]
It ain't enough hours in a day (it ain't enough, ain't enough)
It ain't enough
It ain't enough days in a week (it ain't enough days in a week)
It ain't enough
It ain't enough weeks in a month
It ain't enough
It ain't enough months in a year
To do it all, it ain't enough
