Big Snoop Dogg
Can you be my doctor? Can you fix me up?
Can you wipe me down
So I can make you give it up, give it up
Make you say my name like a Jersey, Jersey
Shuttin' down the game
Be my head coach so you can
And never take me down 'til you can taste the win
Do it again and again till you say my name
And by the way I'm so glad
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat, sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat, sweat, sweat
Can you, can you get me up like I'm late for my first class
So I can give it to you rough like a first draft
Hold you like a paper plane, you know I got paper, babe
Them dollar bills, girl, make it rain
Holiday Inn, come and meet me on my eighth floor
Damn it feels good but I feel bad for the next door
And I, and I, I, I apologize
But when I slip, slip like two girls into slip n' slide
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat, sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat, sweat, sweat
Where you goin'? Whatcha say?
I'm why her river flowin' to another lake
By to ocean, by the ocean, on the beach, on the beach
Let me dip my feet in and make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat, sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat, sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
