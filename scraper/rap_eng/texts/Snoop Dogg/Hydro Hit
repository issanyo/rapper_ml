[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah man, it's the Bigg Snoopy D-O-double-gizzle-fo'shizzle
And I'm in the hizzle with the G-Unit
And the muthafuckin' DPGC
And this is uh, smoke to this volume one
And I'ma show you how we get down cause you know how we get down
You know what we do

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
We like to break it up, roll it up, and blazin' it up
Smokin' it up, takin' a puff, livin' it up, gettin' it up
And stay on some pimp shit, I'm never spillin' my cup

[Verse 2: Daz]
Ho, get me a hit of that hydro chronic cause I wanna get up on it
G-Unit, The Pound, we smoke
Roll it and smoke it, no chokin', don't hold it, control it
Don't cough a hit till we smokin'

[Verse 3: Soopafly]
Yo, what's that sound
I got my niggas in the back fuckin' shit up, we smokin' a pound
I got the word on the herb sometimes I swerve
So superb, a nigga feeling high as a bird

[Snoop Dogg]
We got the chronic fo' sho

[Verse 4: Daz]
When they see that nigga Daz they like: Diggy what up?
Orange or purple in a- put it all in the blunt
I got the bomb-bomb nickelbag
Who stoppin' Dat Nigga Daz?

[Verse 5: Soopafly]
Well puff puff pass it nigga, fuck it give me a charge
I'll smoke big in a building this large
We gon' get high, fuck some hoes
After it's over kickin' bitches out and we still smokin' doja

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
We like to break it up, roll it up, and blazin' it up
Smokin' it up, takin' a puff, livin' it up, gettin' it up
And stay on some pimp shit, I'm never spillin' my cup
