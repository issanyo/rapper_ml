[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Ridin' in my car
And im listening to the radio
Im listening to a sad girl sang
Sangin about how she got her heart broke
She was reaching for stars
I just want me somethin natural
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as if you did not know
She let me play wit her heart
I'm working late I said I'll soon be home
All the while the girl was home alone
Let me tell you what she crying fo'
(Why?)
Cuz I'm fly
Ya he supa fly
Oooo I'm fly

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You know he supa fly
But me im supa dupa and im supa dupa fly

And i wanted this to be elaborate
And so stratuous
And u just slide by and wise-ey

I know you're feeling all hurt inside
But won't you talk to a playa
Let me help out your ride
Im like a counselor a pastor a priest
Or a physchologist
A shriek or a freak

And I ain't afraid to shoot
And i love to toot toot
Beep beep as i slide up the street

Gotta think my shit's staying stacy Adams

On brinks

Shotgun wit dem things
Couch chillin watchin da lion king
Crying and thangs

I'm out late cuz im rhyming for change
I ain't wit dimes for thangs
Hop back and im trying ta aim
At everythang, dat be hating my fame
Just regulatin been lacing da game
Ain't no mistake in da game

And dat's fo' sizzle
Fo times for da riddles

Everywhere we go u noe who us are

And i laugh
