[Wiz:]
High school nigga

And they tryin get the smoke from out of the booth
Haha..But they're not doing a good job naw they ain't!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

My grades getting low but I’m still getting high
I might fuck around and say some crazy shit right there keep going
The might seem slow but time still going by
Hey oh I forgot to mention my girlfriend tripping
And my homies ain’t acting the same
Well, as long as their papers ain’t grinders i’m taking my time
And i’m roll my weed, and take one to the brain

Hook:
I keep one rolled yeah I'm always puffin
Yea I stay baked cause nigga I love it
Had nothing but now we stuntin'
Tell em roll something cause nigga it's nothn
Niggas gettin mad cause my pockets swollen
And everywhere I go yea I'm loaded

[Wiz:]
My money been kind of funny
But i’m still getting fly
And i’m I don’t’ got the best whip but them hoes still jump inside yeah yeah
Oh and I forgot to mention my best friend trippin
And i’m doing all that I can
Hey as long as there papers and grinder i’m stayin in my ground
There’s gonna be haters outside i’m just tryin to take my shine
And that ain't part of the plan

Hook:
I keep one rolled yeah I'm always puffin
Yea I stay baked cause nigga I love it
Had nothing but now we stuntin'
Tell em roll something cause nigga it's nothn
Niggas gettin mad cause my pockets swollen
And everywhere I go yea I'm loaded

[Snoop:]
I guess if you insist I will
I'm a twister feel mista feel good to ya
I got it if ya need it and you kno I will
And this is after school so we gon go until
The janitor, handed her, a pack of that
Righteously she brought it all back to mac
So I'm a do it back to back, got her fat
Bags are packed, posted by the cafeteria
Eatin on a snack, boy I make it crack-a-lack
Days goin to my nights, live a young wild life
King of the zoo
Devin what it do
Knockin all trees down, Devin and Mac with the sac
Rollin up with knees down, baby girl ease down
It's a holiday, we smokin pot today
I got alot to say, I keep it locked away
That's how it is
Dealin with the pressures of my school life
Livin on the edge, joints to the head
And so the man said...

[Hook:]
I keep one rolled yeah I'm always puffin
