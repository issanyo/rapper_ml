Yeah, so funky

[Hook: Snoopzilla]
Niggas hit the pavement, when I come through slow
In a six-fo', hanging out the window
Niggas hit the pavement, when I fall through the club
Chucking up the dub on you scrubs
Niggas hit the pavemment, D-F on the beat
If you don't work, you don't eat
Niggas hit the pavement, real true statement
Grind 'til they pay me, real niggas hit the pavement

[Verse 1: Snoopzilla]
I'm in the coke white BM
Just clocked in at 11 pm
Uh, while I'm blowing my meds
Most of y'all niggas prob'ly goin to bed
I'm out in the red, coming back home with the bread
Handle my medal, Hansel & Gretel
Cheese, keys, breeze, and settle
This shit hot like a pot or a kettle

[Hook] x2
Niggas hit the pavement, when I come through slow
In a six-fo', hanging out the window
Niggas hit the pavement, when I fall through the club
Chucking up the dub on you scrubs
Niggas hit the pavemment, D-F on the beat
If you don't work, then you don't eat
Niggas hit the pavement, real true statement
Grind 'til they pay me, real niggas hit the pavement

[Verse 2: Snoopzilla]
Dropping C's for the Gs, popping my Ps'
Dotting my Is' while crossing my Ts'
Me and Dam spitting game, doing shows overseas
40 years old, have no fucking enemies
Check cheddar, ber-etta let 'em mo' wetter
If you knew better then you'll prol'ly do better
Act like you know, know not better know better
Cause

[Hook]
Niggas hit the pavement, when I come through slow
In a six-fo', hanging out the window
Niggas hit the pavement, when I fall through the club
Chucking up the dub on you scrubs
Niggas hit the pavemment, D-F on the beat
If you don't work, then you don't eat
Niggas hit the pavement, real true statement
Grind 'til they pay me, real niggas hit the pavement

[Verse 3: Snoopzilla]
I live with a maid
I won't be happy 'til my whole team paid
From my momma to my daddy to my kids to my wife
And all my kinfolks in the afterlife
I'm chilling on the moon like Mac Tonight
Big Snoop Dogg got 'em actin like
Money is the key to end all you woes
Mo' money, mo' hoes

[Hook]
Niggas hit the pavement, when I come through slow
In a six-fo', hanging out the window
Niggas hit the pavement, when I fall through the club
Chucking up the dub on you scrubs
Niggas hit the pavemment, D-F on the beat
If you don't work, then you don't eat
Niggas hit the pavement, real true statement
Grind 'til they pay me, real niggas hit the pavement

[Outro: Dam-Funk]
Keep mashing with this funk y'all, keep mashing (x4)
