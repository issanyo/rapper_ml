[Intro: Snoop Dogg]

Every Dogg has his motherfucking day
So today, we gonna put everything on the Dogg Pound low
I'm the motherfucking host Snoop Doggy Dogg and I got my Homie Kurupt in the house

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Mass like murder, coming through like that
I see a nigga on the corner, Snoop pass the strap
Now why in the fuck would this fool ever throw-up
A hood that wanna blow up, another nigga from different set So I sweat not
I could give a fuck because I know we got two Glocks
Everywhere I 'am is different motherfucker done
So yo run, nigga run yo nigga run

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Ay yo check it out
So run for your gun motherfucker and duck, Snoop Dogg on the mic I don't give a fuck

My DJ now play to my tune a DJ jam
Doggy Dogg is on the mic and like Karim I slam

Everywhere I go, I see I gotta kill another crew
Different haters knowing me, I'm the K-U-R-U-P and to the T

Row so here we go, so know you punk niggas know

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Ay yo Whoop there it is, nah Snoop there it is

This is Dogg Pound so check your house, Snoop Dogg is on the mic with the G-funk sound

[Verse 6: Snoop Dogg]
I break niggas, shake niggas take niggas to their whole
It's like 9-4 when I'm on parole
Just mobbing  and [?] and throw up a pound, hitting motherfuckers up and you know I'm foul
I don't really give a fuck about the shit they talk
Cuz' I'm a G for life and I go and C-walk till i can't see no mo
So just check my flow as I blow like the wind
Kurupt come here again

[Verse 7: Kurupt]
Hey, another day for me to get raw
Me? I kick back with Snoopy Doggy Dogg
Every hoe I see, recognize how they going
But yet Snoopy's niggas acting like they don't know my name
Oh, oh
I'm that nigga that they call Kurupt, these niggas talking shit When they in and oh they fucked
I don't give a fuck because I'm just a nigga
I figure bigger niggas gotta reason to a trigger

[Verse 8: Snoop Dogg]
Now I was strolling through the park one day
By [N-O-K?] puffing on a fat J'
Me and my DJ sat pussy
On five or six bitches they rolling in a -64 hitting switches
They say Snoop Doggy Dogg is that you?
I say hell fucking yeah, you know I'm sporting through in grey
I spit my game at this hoe her name is 'Faye Dunaway'
She staying around a corner, hey
So I'm just chilling like a business spitting game at this trick ass bitch
Cuz' I really give a shit
I say, yo we got a party we gonna light this up
It's in my living room and we got the Ozone
On some fat ass chronic and some fat ass dicks
So all we wanna see is assholes and tits
Jiggling and shaking, breaking taking off your clothes cuz'
We don't love them hoes
