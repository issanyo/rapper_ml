[Sacha Baron Cohen]
I've written a song
That I hope is going to bring the world together

[Bono]
Put down your guns and bombs
And just make love forever (Okay then)

[Sting]
He's come to heal the world
And make our nations calmer

[Sacha Baron Cohen]
I am the Austrian Jesus

[Snoop Dogg]
He is the white Obama (He's the white Obama)

[Elton John]
War's just based on hate and fear
Stop fighting North and South Korea

[Sacha Baron Cohen]
You're both basically Chinese

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
And he's Brüno, dove of peace (Hey yo Brüno, where the bitches at?)
You are Brüno, dove of peace (You do a fashion mile, you got the kid, homes)
You are Brüno, dove of peace (You know I love black guys, I'm a chocoholic)
You are Brüno, dove of peace (Brüno wants peace. Either we have peace, or we gonna have mothafuckin' war)

[Bono]
I have a dream for the third world: clean water, food and teaching

[Elton John]
In every village and every town, a place for anal bleaching

[Bono]
We need to rid the world of hunger

[Sacha Baron Cohen]
I'm just like Bono except much younger

[Sting]
He is only nineteen

[Sacha Baron Cohen]
Ich bin Brüno, dove of peace

[Snoop Dogg]
Hey, hey, he gay, he gay. Ok
