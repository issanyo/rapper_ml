Some of 'em lie about the *** they got
And what they do on the block
Some of 'em lie about the *** they pop
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
So many *** wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a *** to stay
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
Now this is for the B's and the C's, and the D's and the H's
And the G's puttin' work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some ***
*** it, if my *** detoxin', it's more for me
Baby, this is presidential really
A pocket full of women understandin' how I'm livin'
Show them *** how you winnin'
It's the beginnin' with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say, it's 'Many Men'
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the *** and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the *** then the clothes, I'ma have to let 'em go
You know how the Dogg roll, don't get it twisted
'Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin' pimpish
And it's comin' from the Beach where them *** is a beast
But I just listen, all that *** is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first, *** the *** last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish
See me, man, I'm nothin' like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
Leanin' in my ride, *** bangin'
Me, I'm ridin' by you on the corner, block ***
I'm livin' that boss' life
The *** come runnin' when they see me comin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
Can have anything, just don't *** with my money
This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
Khaki's and them Tim's and them *** with the platinum mouths
Thinkin' that they blessed by the actions that be comin' out
When you in Magic City, you be carryin' a lot of clout
But trickin' ain't the route, that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holdin' it when they can't do without it
Just put the key up in it *** if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, *** with it for a dolla
If she a balla, she gon' ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Bo$$ Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow, then she gon' ***
All the game you got to give her, be a different *** tomorrow
But I would never bother breakin' out 'Tha Doggfather'
'Less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin' diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreadin' game to my partners
Walkin' on the blue carpet with the Doctor
You see me man, I'm nothin' like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
Leanin' in my ride, *** bangin'
Me, I'm ridin' by you on the corner, block ***
I'm livin' that boss' life
The *** come runnin' when they see me comin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
Can have anything just don't *** with my money
