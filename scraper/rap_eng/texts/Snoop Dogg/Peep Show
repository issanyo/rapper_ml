[Intro]
[R Kelly Verse]
The club go crazy when she pop it like rubber band
Make me wanna get lost on her island, like I’m Gilligan
Take her from this club and get somewhere [?]
No cars though, we’ll be riding on elephants
Tropical drinks and a Malaysian ma'
Then back to shytown years, the craziest ma'
We livin' life fly, it's raining in the club
You ain’t gotta act

[Chorus - Nicole]
Do you like my body?
Like the way it go?
This right here is making all the fellas go 'oh'
Watch the way I work it, I watch the way it grows
Welcome to my peep show, my peep show
My peep show, my peep show

[Verse 2 - Nicole]
Boys, you might as well go and tell your girlfriends 'Bye'
‘Cause I’m feelin' myself, and I might say 'Hi'
But I’m a [??] are we ready to part?
Get dirty on the floor, show me where to go
My pants, the night when the club is through
Your sweat has got my body feeling you
Makes me wanna show my talents to you
So you can see what my body can do
Put your eyes on me
Baby, don’t blink
Baby, don’t blink
Baby, now tell me what you think

[Chorus - Nicole]
Do you like my body? Like the way it goes?
This right here is making all the fellas go oh
Watch the way I work it, I watch the way it grows
Welcome to my peep show, my peep show
My Peep show, my Peep show

[Verse 3 - Nicole]
The way you’re looking at me
I can tell you gotta have it
I’mma back it up a little bit so you can grab it
I want you to work it
But baby don’t attack it
Slow down killer, or I’ll become your habit
My pants, the night when the club is through
Your sweat has got my body feeling you
Makes me wanna show my talents to you
So you can see what my body can do
Put your eyes on me
Baby, don’t blink
Baby, don’t blink
Baby, now tell me what you think

[Chorus - Nicole]
Do you like my body? Like the way it goes?
This right here is making all the fellas go oh
Watch the way I work it, I watch the way it grows
Welcome to my Peep show, my Peep show
My Peep show, my Peep show

[Bridge - Nicole]
Want a peep? Show me where you want it
Want a peep? Show me where you want it
My Peep show, my Peep show
Want a peep? Show me where you want it
Want a peep? Show me where you want it
My Peep show, my Peep show

Then back to shytown years, the craziest ma
We’re living life fly, it's raining in the club
You ain’t gotta act
