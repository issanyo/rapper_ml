[Verse 1: Papoose]
Helicopter in the sky, airplane in the clouds
Boats in the ocean cars travel the ground
I watched from the balcony this is a busy town
Kinda like Miami I might lock it down
My girl with me she cook better than Mr. Chow's
Told her I'll order somethin baby, just dial
Zero for room service she looked up and smiled
I was just stuck in the hood look at me now
Opened up my safe to put the chain around
My neck and I locked my watch, bling blaow!!!
Pinky ring the bracelet, kinda loud
I got alot of jewels cause I got alot of style
Before I got here my homey was on trial
Walked in the court the jurors was like wow
Hollered at Shaq they were playin some clowns
Went to the game can't blend in with the crowd
Won a couple grand when Shaquille got fouled
Betcha we make these a easy ten thou
The best of both worlds is a kilo and a pound
Incase I gotta bang I'm totin the forty cal

[Hook: Papoose] (Snoop Dogg]
You got a system in your trunk (Let It Bang!)
I can see your ass from the front (Let It Bang!)
You gang bang then it's all the same thang
We could bang it on out we could (Bang It Out!)
I dare niggas to violate (We Could Bang It Out!)
Ice grillin in my face (We Could Bang It Out!)
Try to stick me for my papes (We Could Bang It Out!)
We could (Bang It On Out!) We could (Bang It On Out!)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
What it is what it was who you with is you with us?
Cause we love to bang and smoke weed and live it up
I get low and roll a tre with a fo'
Bread bread or fake dead see that's the slogan my nigga
Why you the boss? Cause I been chosen my nigga
And I've been doin this the old fashion way
Stick and movin on these motherfuckers like Cashius Clay
Make it rain, fuck that I'm tryin to stash my cash away
Knockin down trap doors and turnin out rap whores
Sellin out rap tours, on your favorite television show
Goin hard on a ho, East Coast let loose my nigga Papoose he got the juice
So, watch the Impala as it swing by
And, be on the look out for them niggas with them gang signs
That's us and you can trust we 'gon buss
It's Big Snoop and Papoose and yeah we fuckin it up

[Hook: Papoose] (Snoop Dogg]
You got a system in your trunk (Let It Bang!)
I can see your ass from the front (Let It Bang!)
You gang bang then it's all the same thang
We could bang it on out we could (Bang It Out!)
I dare niggas to violate (We Could Bang It Out!)
Ice grillin in my face (We Could Bang It Out!)
Try to stick me for my papes (We Could Bang It Out!)
We could (Bang It On Out!) We could (Bang It On Out!)

[Verse 3: Papoose]
My style similiar to hell, hotter than high temperatures
World wide finisher, The U.S. Of The Lyrical President
The U.K. King, wide sinister
They love me in Canada they call me the Prime Minister
Said I lose my life on the corner
But I'm in Miami on the balcony overlookin the water
Give my credit cards to my daughter
Tell her to swipe it like Swiper from Dora The Explorer
And I just bought her the ice that don't melt
I give her what she wants she spoiled like old milk
They say the block slow if you ain't really smart
Chill, cop him another connect give you the raw deal
Flip your money twice then cover some more chrills
Niggas a flip on you the game ill
Since they like flippin on me, man I cop that long steel
Hit him in his side and make him do the cartwheel
