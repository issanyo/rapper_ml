[Verse 1: 2Pac]
They went and did it, so mash out and get a glass
Don finally got his own drink, call it thug passion
Introducing a special brew, made for a chosen few
I'm thugged out, while Snoop Dogg sippin' Blue
-berry but don't be scary, cause it's naturale
Catch it while it's *hot*, get every drop, cause we runnin' out
Plus the party need this flavor, no need to ask
Forever mashin', people ain't ready for this thug passion

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm headin' to the nearest liquor store (What fo'?)
To get myself some blueberry, you act like you don't know (Oh!)
The new drink provided by the St. Ides
Blueberry is my flavor and I know you wonder why
I'm tellin' all my peoples from the vesre off Gin and Juice
Cause this new taste is guaranteed to get you all loose
So dip down, or skip down however you get it
Blueberry is my flavor, let me know if you wit' it
