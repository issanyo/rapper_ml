[Intro: Brandon Beal]
Oh oh oh ohâ€¦
Never let 'em
Never, never let 'em go

[Verse 1: Brandon Beal]
Baby, I don't have all the right words to say
So if I come off crazy
That's just a chance I gotta take
But baby now I've got you here
Gonna make it last forever, yeah
I don't care who's watching, let 'em stare
Tell me what you like, I'll take you there

[Brigde: Brandon Beal]
Can you feel it?
Gonna let you know
That I feel it
It's time to let it show
It drives me crazy whenever you're around
Let me hold you down

[Hook: Brandon Beal]
And I will never let you go
I will never let you go
It's you and me against the world
And I will never let you go


[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Come and smoke with me and let your hair hang down
Have a shot and see if you can drink that down
Come and sleep with me and creep around this town
Be in ecstasy cause I'll be showin' you how
This is all I do, I make the things drop down
And once you pick it up, I'll make you say wow wow
Do it secretly, so we love profound
Like (?) yep yep that doggy style

[Brigde: Brandon Beal]
Can you feel it?
Gonna let you know
That I feel it
It's time to let it show
It drives me crazy whenever you're around
Let me hold you down

[Hook: Brandon Beal]
And I will never let you go
I will never let you go
It's you and me against the world
And I will never let you go

[Verse 3: Brandon Beal]
So stick around, you can count on me baby, I'm down on my knees
And I will be there girl I swear I'm giving you all that you need
So tell me, are you down, down?
Are you down, down?
Cause it's already a quarter to three
And all we got is right now (only right now)
And I won't stop till you're all over me

[Hook: Brandon Beal]
And I will never let you go
I will never let you go
It's you and me against the world
And I will never let you go

And I will never let you go
I will never let you go
It's you and me against the world
And I will never let you go
