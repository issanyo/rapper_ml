[Verse 1: Faith Evans]
I found a friend who is all to me
His love, is ever true, so true
I love to tell how he lifted me
And from his grace, came through for you

[Chorus (x4): Faith Evans]
I'm saved by his power, divine
I'm saved by new light, sublime
Life now is sweet and my joy is complete
For I'm saved, saved, saved

[Faith Evans]
Hey you, my joy
Sing it yo

[Bridge (x8): Bereal Family]
Life now is sweet and my joy is complete

[Faith Evans]
You know that I've been through, whole lotta things in my life
But I know that my god, my god, my god, my god
He gives me joy
My life is complete
Can't nobody do it like him
No, no, no, no, no he's my
[?] (x3)
My life- yeah
Cause I'm saved
Yeah
Oh my god
Yes, he saved me
Heaven saved for his grace
Oh yeah, and his mercy
I'm saved
Yeah

[Outro: Bereal Family]
Saved, saved, saved
Oh yes I'm saved
Saved, saved, oh yes I'm saved
Saved, saved, saved
Oh yes I'm saved
Saved, saved, saved
