Mystikal talking
We been holding back to motherfukin long
Nigga fuck the dumb shit
It's time to represent nigga

Mystikal
I'm the conscious in the toolbox that's coming for the carpenter
I'm the mirror and the comb clipping the scissors that come from the
Barber ? ? ? the godfather
I'm one of the brand new number 2 pencils out the pencil sharpener
I'm the scarlet water out the delta faucet
I'm the rhyming I'm the artist
I'm vomit in the toilet
I'm the comet when it charges
I'm the drama in new orleans
I'm the vegetables that grow in the garden
All the weeds, dope,and coke at the parties
I'm the m.i.c.h.a.e.l tyler
I'm the loud blackka, blackka, wakka, wakka coming rom behind yah
I'm the stitches of the shirt that make the polo man trill inside the
Timberland
I'm the bells on trigger man
Who? me that's who
I'm the voice in the microphone coming from the booth
I'm the ground when you think
I'm the file on the shank
I'm the pile in the bank
I'm the round off the tank
Chorus mystikal and snoop
I'm that nigga mystikal
And I'm the dogg
That's that nigga
I like to hustle and ball

Knuckle up nigga, knuckle up nigga

Knuckle up nigga, knuckle up nigga
If you sleeping I'm trippin buckle up nigga
