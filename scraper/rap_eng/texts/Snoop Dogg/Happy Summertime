[Intro: R. Kelly & Snoop Dogg]
Happy summertime, niggas (ahh, yeah)
We rolling, we rolling, we rolling, we rolling
We rolling, we rolling, we rolling, we rolling
Yeah

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Drop-top in the summertime
And I'm rolling through the block with the sun shining
And I, I just wanna ride (that's right), I just wanna ride
Go to the mall and I hit the gym
Have a pool party, gets some chicks for a swim
I just wanna ride, I just wanna ride

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Sun shining like California
Come here, girl, let me push up on ya
Ooh, how we do in the Chi on a hot day
Pull up to the club 'cause it's Friday
Let's drink and hit the dance floor
DJ put the summer jam on
Big chips at the bar, spending
GT with the wheels spinning
Let's get somewhere and get high (so high)
For the rest of the night (oh yeah)
Sex and then gon' get a bite (yeah)
Oh, tape with a thug, baby
And if you want it (if you want it)
You can get it from the back
Catch me rolling on the block with the beat playing
Making it hot for you (making it hot for you)
How we do (it's how we do)
And if your girl's looking at me
I might have to snatch her up (yeah)
When your head turns
This is how we do, summertime

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Drop-top in the summertime
And I'm rolling through the block with the sun shining
And I, I just wanna ride (I just wanna ride)
I just wanna ride
Go to the mall and I hit the gym
Have a pool party, gets some chicks for a swim (I just wanna)
I just wanna ride, I just wanna ride

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Slip, dip, trip, we flip the new hit
You gots to do it with Mr. Cool Whip
'Cause I'm better than the rest of them
I'm two-stepping on Lake Michigan
Oh my God, my nephew done did it again
Pool full of women and more tryna get in
Well, c'mon, it's all cool, ain't no rules
It's the summertime, so we gon' act a fool
What you wanna do? Nah, what you oughta do
Is rush me a plate of that barbecue with a quickness
Move fast, better yet, move quicker
Then get my a 40 ounce from Kenwood Liquor
Slide by Millennium Park
One more spot to hit before it gets dark
Lake Shore Drive, slip 'til we slide
Summertime on the Westside, Westside, Westside

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
Oh, it's all on
We be rolling on those 24's
(Rolling, rolling)
Coming down your strip
Everything is fine
312 and 213 area codes
So niggas, don't trip
'Cause it's summertime

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Drop-top in the summertime
And I'm rolling through the block with the sun shining
And I, I just wanna ride (I just wanna ride)
I just wanna ride
Go to the mall and I hit the gym
Have a pool party, gets some chicks for a swim
I just wanna ride, (just ride) I just wanna ride
(Drop the top)

Drop-top in the summertime
And I'm rolling through the block with the sun shining
And I, I just wanna ride (that's right), I just wanna ride
Go to the mall and I hit the gym
Have a pool party, gets some chicks for a swim
I just wanna ride, (I just wanna ride) I just wanna ride
(Come on and go with me)

Drop-top in the summertime
And I'm rolling through the block with the sun shining
And I, I just wanna ride (that's right), I just wanna ride
(Come on and roll with me)
Go to the mall and I hit the gym
Have a pool party, gets some chicks for a swim
I just wanna ride, I just wanna ride
