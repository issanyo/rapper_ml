[Snoop Dogg]
Fuck, sittin' up lettin' these motherfuckerz know, though
You're my pimp buddies, my boy Sean Dogg, you on a mission (Yeah, baby!)
Creep Dogg, I know you trippin' (I feel you) Ya heard me? (um-hm)
[murmur] We just sittin' up in here droppin' game about these motherfuckin'...HOS
(HOS?!) That's right, hoes, and that what the topic is today on the show: hoes
(Why you always gotta talk about 'em?) I mean, cause if you gotta blame it on somebody
You might as well blame it on a motherfuckin ho....

[beat kicks in]

You feel me, Meech
(Now that I think about it...) It was all on a motherfuckin' ho
(Ya heard me?) That the topic today: Hoes
Live here, Snoop Dogg, and uh..what I'm gonna do right here
[inhales] besides smokin' this weed...I'm a holla at 'chy'all...
It was all on a ho, in one minute or two it, too
Cause I know I got it like that...y'knahmsayin?
It was all on a ho (Ho, ho, ho)

["Now that I think about it?" echoes]

Shiit, niggas straight feelin' like Bobby Womack
Is in this motherfucker tonight...y'knahmsayin?
That's the way I feel about 'cha...hm hm..it was all on a ho...
But uh...it's Nineteen-motherfuckin'-Ninety Eight
And I believe today is uh...October 31st, if I ain't...wrong...right, nigga?
Yeah, yeah there, so uh... as they say in Halloween world or...
White world or just a world, in general: Trick or Treat, bitch (Ha ha!)
Ya feel me? (Ya heard me?) We puttin' this Space-Age pimpin'
Full ?Fledge? pimpin' right here...y'know?
Right now, bitch can't even look at me
Bitch you under arrest for "Reckless Eyeballs"
We just doin' this real P-Im right about now, ya feel me?
(That's it...that's it...) Because...I mean, I got a big grip...a BIG, BIG memory, cuz
I remember a whole lot of bitches didn't wanna give no nigga no title "Playa"
Bitches wouldn't even look at me, y'knahmsayin? (Yeah you!)
They just want a nigga to bust a rap about 'em, y'know (Yeah you!)
Buy 'em sometin' to eat from...IHOP, y'know
Go get 'em a Big Mac value pack or sumthin'...
But uh...I'm a tell you what I really remember the most about these bitches, cuz
(What chu remember, dawg?)

[Snoop raps]
I remember Rachel, Tina, Lisa, and Grace
Cause every single one of them had a special place in my heart
From the start, see I was just a young puppy
A young dummy, panties, bitches to fuck with me
Now that I grew up and blew up, I look back
And thanked [thought] on these hoes, they straight to' up, know what?
I'm in effect for the nine-eight
See now I'm scared of love, like my homeboy Nate
And I don't wanna hurt no mo'...so...
I rather go to the Mo' with a ho and leave my rubber on the flo' (What?!)
And call my nigga, Sean Dizzay
To come scoop me up in the cut, Dogg, nigga, what, chy'all? (What, what, what)
Ain't knowin? Pimpin' and ho-in'
Keep the grass growin', "Nigga, where you goin'?"
Look here bitch, don't ask me shit
Did I interupt you while [*slurping noises*] you was sucking my dick, beyotch?
I don't need the stress, besides talkin' back to a pimp would get yo ass slapped
Respect the GAME (GAME), and I promise you the game gon' do the motherfuckin' same
I learned a whole lot from these bitches of my past
A bitch with no class is worse than a bitch with no ass
And you wonder why I'm from The Pound?
Shiiiit, if a bitch can't swim, nigga, she bound to drown, nigga

Hook: [with echoing "Now that I think about it"]
It was all on a ho, what chu trippin' fo', nigga?
It was all on a ho, Gs' up, hoes down, what chu trippin' fo'? (What chu trippin' for'?)
It was all on a ho, why you trippin', dawg? Hoes down, Gs' up
It was all on a ho, what chu trippin fo', ya heard? Gs' up, hoes down, it was all on a ho

It was Nineteen-motherfuckin'-Ninety Three
Me and Sean Dogg in the CPT
And we fuckin' with these fuckin' mob bicthes he know
And the one named Kiki, she's so kinky
Said she loved my video, so you know where we goin here
Now she feelin' freaky, and wanna braid my hair
So I sit back, relax, and let her twist
And put my head back on a pound of fish ?????
(Wait a minute!) Wait a minute! Let me hit it!
"Nah! I ain't even trippin' let me get some head in the kitchen
And keep dippin'", Then I looked in the living room and
See my nigga Sean Dogg bitch straight trippin'
So, you know what's next..(What up?)..no sex!
Pull out cha dick and bust a nut on her dress, (Say what?) (Word!)
Like Billy Clinton, we representin'
For all you women, bitches, keep swimmin'
We never save 'em and that's on The Pound
Cause if the bitch can't swim, she bound to drown, nigga

Hook: [with echoing "Now that I think about it"]
