[Snoop Dogg]
Yo' strategy, some pimp tragedy
It's Snoop Dogg, the black James Caggedy
In agony, Agatha, Christy
Agana, miss me, pop the mo' with funk the Crissy
Is he, goin out his mind (yep)
I'm, organized with mine (yep)
In rhyme cuz crime, pays (yep)
Blaze the haze for days
For real B, ya feel me, ya feel me
And, it's supreme, a few niggas on my team
Bonafide hustlers 'bout that cream
We'll cut a nigga, gut a nigga, shut a nigga up
For my paper, I'll wet a nigga up
Did'ya hear me do' (Hear me do')
Ya feel me do' (Feel me do')
I'm live in stereo (Live in stereo)
Like a cherry-o, bury dough, Robert De Ner-io
Snoopy D-O double bubble, with the whole bundle
Don't worry 'bout what one do

[Hook] 2x

[Scarface]
The suits, we pimp in tennis shoes
Fuck Cristal, what the Henny do?
You smoke dope and weed, blow 'dro
You got dough and we've got dough
We monster mash, you see me Ruff Ryde
You a nigga out here, hate niggas, wishin he was white
I'm the nigga out hear pullin up Excursions
Throwin dicks to dykes, turnin out virgins
So fuck your coupe, it's Scarface and Snoop
Up in Bing-town snatchin bitches off the mini six-deuce
And sue dat dame, with "Tru dat" game
Get her ass naked, and black-n-blue that thang
The news that came was the Made Men wattn't
But the paper was the influence and that's what done it
You cuff these hoes, we muff these hoes
You and Captain Save Ya Baby Mother, FUCK these hoes

[Snoop Dogg]
