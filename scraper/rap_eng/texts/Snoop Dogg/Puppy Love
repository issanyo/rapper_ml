[Verse 1: Daz]
I ain't got no time for no bitches, I gotta clock my dough
Clownin', hittin' switches in a green 6-4
With the drink in a on deck and the bombest indo
A car full of gas and nowhere to go
I gets a call on the phone, "What's happenin'?"
Pimpin', chillin' with bitches drinking Silver Satin
Is them bitches on deck, on deck to the fullest
Gots that type of game and I'm know just to pull 'em
Now as I stroll and as I pass by
I'm maxin' with my doggs feelin' dandy and high
Is that looney muthafucka that they call Kurupt
Ballin' out the house with some Gin in his cup

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Now I found myself blowin' out smoke
Bombed out looney and locced
Open up them doors let me see some of them hoes
It's Kurupt and I'm liable to fuck three or four
I'm hittin' hoes like I'm hittin' licks
But I don't love that trick bitch
'Cause bitches gettin' niggas dick sick
I don't pay rent, my rent gets paid
I pimp hoes like silky train
On and on it goes
I thought these muthafuckas knew, but now you know

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Love, puppy love
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Love, puppy love
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch

[Verse 3: Nate Dogg]
1975 I was just a young pup
Tryin' to learn to be a dogg
But in the process steadily gettin' fucked
I met this lil' sexy dame
Y'all before I knew, all the rules to the game
It ain't no need to lie
A lil' nigga like me got played, and if she left me
I thought I'd die
Y'all don't ask, I don't the reason why
Thought she was sent from the heavens above
Y'all it's just a bad taste of puppy love

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Love, puppy love
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Love, puppy love
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
Sometimes I sit and think of how I used to be
Before I got converted to a D-O-double G
I'd like to thank that girl from way back in the days
'Cause if it weren't for you I wouldn't pimp this way

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Love, puppy love
Love, puppy love
Love, puppy love
Love, puppy love
Love, puppy love
Love, puppy love
Love, puppy love
Love, puppy love
Love, puppy love
Love, puppy love
