Valifornia, Raven Felix
Bitch, Snoop Dogg
What time is it?

[Hook: Raven Felix]
G-g-got my girls in the living room gettin’ it on
And we ain’t leavin’ ‘til six in the morning
We ain't leavin’ ‘til six in the morning
Girls in the living room gettin’ it on
And we ain’t leavin’ ‘til six in the morning
We ain't leavin’ ‘til six in the morning

[Verse 1]
Don’t be talking like a star if you ain’t got that life
I don’t even remember what went down last night
I’m ‘bout to be ready to go out, damn right
They tryna holla ‘cause I’m flyer than a first class flight
Now they love it how I flow on these bitches
H-h-hit the stage and put on a show for these bitches
I’m different, don’t put me in the same boat as these bitches
God forbid if I’m ever looking as broke as these bitches
When I pose for these pictures
I’m a rare breed, exactly what these bitches can’t be
The way I do my thing makes them all [?] Stanley
Eighteen, and I’m barely legal
And I’m wearing a little something, something barely see through
Now I’m throwing shade to the haters, we can barely see you
Cause they waiting on Valifornia, this is just a preview
Of what we do in the Valley, I got my friends all around me
And shit’s about to get rowdy, cause every night is a party

[Hook: Raven Felix]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Don't watch the clock, watch the moves I make
The cake I bake, steak to steak, the rules I break
Realistically, you in the midst of me
What you want and what you are and what's your fantasy?
Party people in the place to be
I see that she and y’all do agree with me
And we will be, Raven be the she with me
Ain’t nothing puffing like chief and G
The key to me, the pimp-hop philosophy
Listen how my words slide right on beat
Walk your dog like Fido beat
Left hind leg up, now pee on the tree
Oh yeah, we killing them Loc
We the bombest, I’m honest and iller than most
West Coast motherfucker, ‘til the sun burnt up
It’s five in the morning, we still turnt up
