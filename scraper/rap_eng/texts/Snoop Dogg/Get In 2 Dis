[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Get up, to get down
Get off, get wild
Get up, to get down
Get off, get wild

[Verse 1: Charlie Wilson]
Snoop Dogg done did it, came wit' it, now things is alright
C.W. came wit' it, now we're funkin' up the party like
So if you wit' it, come get it, and gon' and get down
Because we came to rock you and shock you with this G-Funk sound

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Get up, to get down
Get off, get wild
Get up, to get down
Get off, get wild
Get up, to get down
Get off, get wild
Get up, to get down
Get off, get wild

[Verse 2: Charlie Wilson]
I just came wit' it, so get it, straight trip to funky
We gonna rock 'em while the funk, cause I got funk for your brain
Come on get wit' it, just sweat it on the dance floor
It's just like makin' love, and make 'em wanna rock some more

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
Get up sucka
Security, this sucka don't wanna get up to get down
He definitely gotta get off

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Get up, to get down
Get off, get wild
Get up, to get down
Get off, get wild
Get up, to get down
Get off, get wild
Get up, to get down
Get off, get wild

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
This funk was produced to make ya trunk hella loose
To tell the truth, ain't nuttin' Snoop, poof
We came to invade them braids
Khaki suits, Stacy boots, wit' grey Cascades
Great parties, like one time
Have everybody ready to get sweaty 'till the sunshine
One nation, overtaken for the bacon
Feel the floor, ain't no sankin'
I bang a fool on his chin face
So if he got feedback, ease back then blast
You know the cycle always gotta continue
So stay tuned for the drama I'll send you
F-U-N-K, for those one-hitter quitters, one song on their disc play
You know who I'm talkin' about
You gotta get up to get down or get out

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson (2x)]
Get up, to get down
Get off, get wild
Get up, to get down
Get off, get wild
Get up, to get down
Get off, get wild
Get up, to get down
Get off, get wild
