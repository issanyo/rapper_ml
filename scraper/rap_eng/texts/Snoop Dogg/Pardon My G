[Refrain: Snoop Dogg]
Let me talk to you for just a quick moment
Cause I see that you are in need
You wanna drink to get drunk so you drank all my drank but I rather roll weed
Since your intentions are not my dimensions, I think it's time that you should leave
And if you don't mind, hop off my line
Cause I am inclined to find a new dime

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Said she love dark meat, filet mignon
If she lay with Shawn, she gon' stay til morning
Most likely give a grade A performance
No waste but her cake's enormous
Dirty ass mouth but her face is gorgeous
She gonna make a playboy pay her mortgage
Escape in a Wraith [?] fortress
Don't get the picture, stay out the portrait
Shawty, you know damn well you know me
Caught you outside, Danielle Bregoli
Uh uh, she's a diva and she knows that
Every moment worth a Kodak

[Hook: Fashawn]
You got something I want
But that's something I don't need
She wanna pour a drink
I'd rather roll my weed
Should I stay? Should I leave?
Got my heart on my sleeve
Now I hardly can breathe
Are you with him or with we
Pardon my G

[Refrain: Snoop Dogg]
Let me talk to you for just a quick moment
Cause I see that you are in need

Since your intentions are not my dimensions, I think it's time that you should leave
And if you don't mind, hop off my line
Cause I am inclined to find a new dime

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Every city that I go in, every town I hit
Scrolling through my IG I found a bitch
Yeah, flipping through the pages
Baby name Stasha, the bitch is outrageous
And I love the shit that she do for me
Keep it one hundred and being truthfully
See ain't no bitch like this bitch I got
She roll my Backwoods while taking a shot
Side piece baby, keep making it hot
The last bitch I had was a straight up thot
That's neither here nor there cause I just don't care
Fashawn my nigga, put one in the air
And let it go, fuck a ho on the real though
And bitch quit acting like a weirdo

[Hook: Fashawn]
You got something I want
But that's something I don't need
She wanna pour a drink
I'd rather roll my weed
Should I stay? Should I leave?
Got my heart on my sleeve
Now I hardly can breathe
Are you with him or with we
Pardon my G

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
You the Kim to my Kanye
But she gotta have a face like Tinashe
Based on Beyonce
Waste with the concave
Shaped like a 7.8 and tastes like an entree
I don't have to feast but bon appetit
After we fuck, we don't have to speak
Saw you on IG, still I had to tweet
I'm glad we can actually meet
That ass is as massive as master suit
The type that I smash and I brag for weeks
Yeah, she's a dime and I notice that
I read every sign like a zodiac, facts

[Hook: Fashawn]
You got something I want
But that's something I don't need
She wanna pour a drink
I'd rather roll my weed
Should I stay? Should I leave?
Got my heart on my sleeve
Now I hardly can breathe
Are you with him or with we
Pardon my G

[Interlude: Fashawn]
You are now rocking with the best
International F and Big Snoop
You see I wear my heart on my sleeve
But you're making it hard, you're making it hard for me to breathe
GCB

[Hook: Fashawn]
You got something I want
But that's something I don't need
She wanna pour a drink
I'd rather roll my weed
Should I stay? Should I leave?
Got my heart on my sleeve
Now I hardly can breathe
Are you with him or with we
Pardon my G
