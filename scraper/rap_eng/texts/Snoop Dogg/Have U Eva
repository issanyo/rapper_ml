[Intro]
We are gathered here today on this sorrowful occasion (Have you ever?)
To say goodbye to the dearly departed

[Hook]
Have you ever? (Ain’t never did that! Ain’t never did that!)
Have you ever? (Ain’t never did that! Ain’t never did that!)
Have you ever dipped in a low rider?
Have you ever sipped Moët straight out a bottle?
Have you ever?

[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger]
Have you ever had a bitch ass nigga
Ran out on you with the [?] talking ‘bout you?
This the penis, whip it out, [?] yeah boy
Yeah nigga, we ain’t fuckin’ wit you
Have you ever did have a chance to run and no worries
At the corner nigga ain’t got a dome?
I get [?]the money, all you
Haters and bitches, now what the fuck you want from me?
Coming from the same environment we all from
Can’t go for that, nigga you want some
You can have it, then have it just to have it
And then it disappeared just like magic
Voila! Grab it out the hat

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Gave it to the homie and he had to get it back
Took it to the corner let him double up his [?]
Told him it’s a trap, ‘cause he fuckin’ with a rat
So quick with a twist, nine times outta
Ten, it’s on a bitch. He too
Hard, he gon switch, no snitch
One from niggas don’t do that shit

[Hook]
Have you ever? (Ain’t never did that! Ain’t never did that!)
Have you ever? (Ain’t never did that! Ain’t never did that!)
Have you ever dipped in a low rider?
Have you ever sipped Moët straight out a bottle?
Have you ever?

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Burst on a nigga for the turf, what it’s worth
Give a fuck, nigga, truth hurts. Do low
Two oh, yellow paint on the grill, ride by
Slide by, big homie on the wheel, no witness
Relentless, back on the streets after eight years
Sentence, still jumping fences
The job ain’t hiring, ain’t there no motherfuckin’
Gangbang retirement, you’re either in it
For life, or you’re not. Pray that you don’t
Get shot on the block Have what you have not

[Verse 4: Daz Dillinger]
I ain’t never met a nigga more scary than you
Or my uncle, what I am is not fucking with you
Or my momma trying to become, yes, a dime a dozen
And what it is, yeah it wasn’t, yeah you fuckin’ with cousins
Or your relatives, well give me sedatives
Don’t worry ‘bout us, nigga, let us live
I see the future, whatcha thinking’, yeah you did that
Nigga, peel your grill back, yeah nigga, yeah, you feel that

[Hook]
Have you ever? (Ain’t never did that! Ain’t never did that!)
Have you ever? (Ain’t never did that! Ain’t never did that!)
Have you ever dipped in a low rider?
Have you ever sipped Moët straight out a bottle?
Have you ever?

[Sample]
He was dearly, and he has departed us, that’s why we call him the dearly departed. In other words, the nigga dead. As you can see him laying here, I know the nigga dead. Didn’t think you was ever gonna die, did you, nigga? I told you about fucking around…

[Hook]
Have you ever?
Have you ever dipped in a low rider?
Have you ever sipped Moët straight out a bottle?
Have you ever?
Have you ever?
Have you ever dipped in a low rider?
Have you ever sipped Moët straight out a bottle?
Have you ever?
