Now what is it that you want from Soopafly
Recoginiz, I let you kick it
You let me stick it, then I ric it
Say you law fit, toss it, its gone
I don't like to talk on the phone
And maybe tap, get an job
Bitch I rap, you keeping talking shit
You would be the same bitch i slap
What about nine inches of emphasis, on it
Hoe said I was dog, well dog on it
Shit, let me stick my grand territory
Bitch tried to flip the story, my glory
I told her no money involved, problem solved
No more talking about it
Now you can shout it out loud if you want bitch
Soopafly is still going to remain one
About the fact, you ain't getting jack shit form me
Talking about this other nigga gave you an g
Ooh wee, it ain't me, it an I
You ain't green and you damn shore you can't get me high
Bitch, why the fuck do think they call me Soopafly
If I ride duce yo ass, im like wind in the sky
Traveling, yea see you in traffic or not
Thinking im giving up plastic im not
You got your nerve, you wanted to buy her an ring
Called her on the phone, there you go you got your ring
Told the hoe she can go on and do your thang
Hit the streets why you at it bitch buy me an chain
Flip the game, like im fliping an bird
What's the word, leave them flush, while im rollin pimp out plus
