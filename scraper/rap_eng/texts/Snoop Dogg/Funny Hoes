Ayo, you know what time it is
It’s time to drop some of this shit

Ball like a gangsta
(Fuckin with the funny hoes)
And I’mma always stand tall like a gangsta
I’ll take you to money, I ain’t fuckin with them funny hoes
Ball like a gangsta
(Fuckin with the funny hoes)
And I’mma always stand tall like a gangsta
I’ll take you to money, I ain’t fuckin with them funny hoes

[Verse: 1 Snoop Dogg]
One bad bitch tried to set me up
Get me up, out of my hood
You got back, shot that, told that batch
Talk if she want some doggy dick you gotta come get that
Won’t be got bitch, I think not
Besides, I got homies posted on the 9-8 block
My credentials be potentially leaving my footprints
Chief of executive but stay on that hood shit
Cut more … than the new Mark Fader
Take some now, save some for later
A deed is free mind or some mory green gator
Fella shippin with the bishop, yea he made it
Celebratin, enterprising, merchandising, self-sufficing
But uncompromising
For what it’s worth, I’m down to earth
Feel more slim, this the rebirth on the illegal
For really though, feel me though

For really though
And I’mma always stand tall like a gangsta
I’ll take you to money, I ain’t fuckin with them funny hoes
Ball like a gangsta
(Fuckin with the funny hoes)
And I’mma always stand tall like a gangsta
I’ll take you to money, I ain’t fuckin with them funny hoes

[Verse: 2 Mac Lucci]
How to get the money? I ain’t fuckin with them funny hoes
Grindin with my uncle Snoopie, baby that’s a lot of dough
Bang bang mulla gang, hoes I got a lot of those
Hustle boy go wrong for this money, even my mama know
I was a screw up but grew up fast
Motivated by the cash, blame it on my dad
To be it so, my pampers was a stash
My pops had the double arm, my moms had the jack
For really though, see the walking down Figaro
When I was young, yea I didn’t know
When I would get a little bigger though
I would snick my rope
How you broach, kick some gang now getting dough
For really though? Dawgs and Locs
If we get off that bullshit then we all can smoke
Get it low? Gotta get it and go
Keep your head to the sky and your foot to the floor

For really though
And I’mma always stand tall like a gangsta
I’ll take you to money, I ain’t fuckin with them funny hoes
Ball like a gangsta
(Fuckin with the funny hoes)
And I’mma always stand tall like a gangsta
I’ll take you to money, I ain’t fuckin with them funny hoes

Yea California hustle mane Lou G
Check this
It’s a whole lot of money to get nephew
Nah, for really tho
All you gotta do is get it mane
Put your pimp foot forward and let the other one come behind it
You feel what I’m sayin?
Really tho
Money
Get it

For really though
And I’mma always stand tall like a gangsta
I’ll take you to money, I ain’t fuckin with them funny hoes
Ball like a gangsta
(Fuckin with the funny hoes)
And I’mma always stand tall like a gangsta
I’ll take you to money, I ain’t fuckin with them funny hoes

For really though
And I’mma always stand tall like a gangsta
I’ll take you to money, I ain’t fuckin with them funny hoes
Ball like a gangsta
(Fuckin with the funny hoes)
And I’mma always stand tall like a gangsta
I’ll take you to money, I ain’t fuckin with them funny hoes
