[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Let me get that intro
Blunts, gators
Hand me my mink

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
On the East duckin' Feds from a peephole
1989, gangbangin' was at its peak
This the beat that make me reminisce on G-funk
Three summers before The Chronic hit the streets
I would rather slang hand to hand to a fiend
Rappin' on the side, trappin' was priority
But every now and then I go scoop my little thing
Pull up in my MC bangin' New Jack Swing
Ooh, summertime time back in Long Beach
Passin' one bottle, 40 oz. O.E
I didn't have a dollar but a nigga had a dream
Whippin' over the stove and a nigga gotta eat
Threw my raps in the garbage, fuck bein' a MC
Thank the Lord for Nate Dogg and thank God for Warren G
Funny how time flies when you're high as me

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
I think I'm in the Ruff Endz now
I seen her throwin' up H-Town
You was livin' off of Dru Hill
Wasn't ready for the world but baby, who is?
Know you prettier than all the El DeBarges
Never worry 'bout the total of the charges (I got this)

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
And if you need an escape for now, meet up at room 112
We do it anywhere (We can do it anywhere)
Ooh, yeah, and if you fiendin' (If you need a freak)
Just call me, baby (Call me)
I'll have you screamin' (Call me)
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus: The Last Artful, Dodgr & Anderson .Paak]
We'll get back to all that ghetto shit we like
But for now just let me hold you all night
Cheek to cheek just like they do in the movies
Tonight, baby, I want your love on time
As soon as I put this on
Cutie pie, you're the reason why
As soon as I put this on
I love ya so and I'll never let you go
As soon as I put this on, girl
Ooh, yeah
As soon as I put this on
Don't fight it, let it live

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
And if you need an escape for now, meet up at room 112
We do it anywhere (We can do it anywhere)
Ooh, yeah, and if you fiendin' (If you need a freak)
Just call me, baby (Call me)
I'll have you screamin' (Call me)
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus: The Last Artful, Dodgr & Anderson .Paak]
We'll get back to all that ghetto shit we like
But for now just let me hold you all night
Cheek to cheek just like they do in the movies
Tonight, baby, I want your love on time
As soon as I put this on
Cutie pie, you're the reason why
As soon as I put this on
I love ya so and I'll never let you go
As soon as I put this on, girl
Ooh, yeah
As soon as I put this on
Don't fight it, let it live
