Ha, ha
What is an m.c.?
If he can't rap
What is a d.j.?
If he can't scratch
Don't worry about a thing cause my niggas goin' do it all just like that

(hook)x3
Boom, boom, boom...boom
Ahhh, bend over, bend over

Indeed I am
Flossy like gangsta shit
I got pounds of weed and keys
Sittin' on g's
Catch a breeze
When I ride by high
Sittin' on tonas
Tearing up spots
And blocks in my hood ain't got no corners
Cause we done chipped 'em all off a proper piece
Bustin' rocks and Glocks
And gettin ghost from the police
No peace
So, he gets served with no concern
To who gets burned and one day they'll learn
Not to be f**kin' with the nigga
Buckin' with the trigga
Nothing you could figga
Could help you escape
From this mind state
That I create young nigga
Yeah! and it's just like that

(snoop)x2
L.b.c. out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom...boom
My rearview mirror's vibratin' cause my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom...boom

(soopafly)
Now I rock
Some will talk
It don't stop
When that funk shit drops
To make your shit go pop
Now let that beat ride
In your 'g ride
We gettin' me right
Hittin' with that dogg pound "c" life
Now it's i, with that stylish flow
So niggas step back or heads get cracked
And I won't let back
Who coming with that gangsta shit
The shit that only gangsta's get gangsta with
Now quick to bust your ass like the cop
Waiting, debating for my ass to flip flop
But I don't flop
I just flip the script
When I did and set trip
Keep the clip close to my hip
And don't say shit
When I blast
I done told your ass
Slow the f**k on down
Dogg pound, motherf**ker

(snoop)x2
Boom, and you know that
D.p.g's out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom...boom
My rearview mirror's vibrating and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom...boom

(hershey loc? )
From the archives
I arise off the long beach streets
Will be comlete to the do is done to all that competes
Don't be alarmed as I swarm through
I warned you and your crew see wax
So, what's that?
A known fact
Battle that the habitat our men is deadly
You can get diluted
Or depends on where your head be
Striving for what your in for

And for your info mo' flow
Than the tightest nigga flowed in ninety-four
So, stand and deliver
Watch nigga's shiver
Quiver in they boots
As I mob with my troops
Through the east
Where the phonies get deleted
Be seated, and all the g's I know
Stay heated

(tray deee)
See I was born to be known as a thug and theif
So anyone with beef
I gotta slug to sleep
Peep, I'm not no nigga
Figga' he can come up
By getting a job so I mob
Not givin' a f**k
I'm the drama
Mama warned all they kids about
I mash up strapped
Get my dibs n' out
Hustler musn't trustin' a gat
To keep me fat, seeking victims
Pick 'em and then I stick them in track
My heat black
With the cereal number scratched out
Don't wear a glass shield but
You'll still be assed out
I'm mr. tray deee
And since they say "g" as my title
My method mainly homicidal

(snoop)x3
Boom, yeah, and you know that
2-1 out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom...boom
My rearview mirror vibrating cause my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom...boom

(2Pac)
Ha, ha, ha
Could it be
My history living g like
Enemies that wanna see me
Would it be like
Picture me practicing perfection
Now hit the deck
Playa haters gettin' chin checked
When I hit the set
Watch how they fall
When I buck 'em all
We outlaw, westside
Playa, touch 'em all
I buck them all
Then remain ballin'
Out the moon
With my Glock cocked
Shot calling
Brothers fall then they crawl
And they beg for they life
Should of never tried to rush me
Your dead here tonight
This is thug life
Go tell them busta's
Up at bad boy records
That tricks got a big mouth
Busta better check it
I can see it plain as day
This game I play wide open
I pull the trigga
Dead figga with his eyes open
His pride broke
And I tried smoking
But, bailed out
Soon as they left me at the jail house
Mobbin' in my...

(snoop)
Yeah, and you know that
Death row out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom...boom
Outlaw out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom...boom
My rearview mirrors vibrating and my speakers go
D.p.g out the moon and you know that
