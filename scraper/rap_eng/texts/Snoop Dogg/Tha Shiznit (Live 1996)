[Intro]
Make some motherfucking noise!
Yeah
C'mon, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mon, yeah, yeah, yeah

The D.O. double G
The P.O.U.N.D
The D.O. double G
The P.O.U.N.D

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Poppin', stoppin', hoppin' like a rabbit
When I take the Nina Ross, ya know I gots to have it
I lay back in the cut, retain myself
Think about the shit, and I'm thinkin' wealth
How can I makes my grip
And how should I make that nigga straight slip
Set trip, gotta get him for his grip
As I dip around the corner, now I'm on another
Mission, wishin', upon a star
Snoop Doggy Dogg with the caviar
In the back of the limo, no demo, this is the real
Breakin' niggas down like Evander Holyfield, chill
'Til the next episode
I make money, and I really don't love hoes
Tell you the truth, I swoop in the Coupe
I used to sell loot, I used to shoot hoops
But now I make hits every single day
With that nigga, the diggy Dr. Dre
So lay back in the cut motherfucker 'fore you get shot
It's 1-8-7, and you know it don't stop

[Chorus: Tha Dogg Pound & (Audience)]
Now when I say hell, you say yeah
Hell (Yeah!)
When I say hell, you say yeah
Hell (Yeah!)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Boy it's gettin' hot, yes indeed it is
Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I'm 'bout as crazy as Biz
Markie, spark the chronic bud real quick
And let me get into some fly gangsta shit
Yeah, I lay back, stay back in the cut
Niggas try to play the D-O-G like a mutt
I got a little message, don't try to see Snoop
I'm finna fuck a bitch, what's her name? It's Luke
You tried to see me on the TV, you'se a B.G
D-O-double-G, yes I'm a O.G
You can't see my homie Dr. Dre
So what the fuck a nigga like you gotta say
Gotta take a trip to the MIA
And serve your ass with a motherfuckin' AK
You can't see the D-O-double-G, 'cause that be me
I'm servin' 'em, swervin' in the Coupe
The Lexus flexes from Long Beach to Texas
Sexist hoes, they wanna get with this
'Cause Snoop Dogg is the shit, biatch!
