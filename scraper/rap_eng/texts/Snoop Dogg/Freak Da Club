Big Snoopy D-O Double jizzle fa' Shizzle
And the home girl Aki-la
Moshi moshi

(Verse 1)
[Aki-la]
Ghetto superstar, flip 20 bars
Kasanariau nika koku no Vibe
Need a hit song
Kowasu kettou
Pass 20 rappers just to get a Snoop Dogg
Hot hype tracks, hit'um like that
Platinum after goldm, kokoro touka
I'm from the J, to A, to P-A-N
Umi koe the way or ur way dekiru michi to wa

[Snoop Dogg]
Well god damn, here we go, I'm 'bout to pop some more
Unlock the show
Mr. Un-stop-pable
Proper flow
Clock the dough
Rock the boat
Cop and blow
Hop the four
You know
Cause I'm known around the world, home boys and girls
And when I'm rhyming, I'm like diamonds and pearls
Curls and braids, clubs and spades, dubbs and babes
It's all the same, aki-la do the damn thing

[Aki-la]
Hoshii mono wa jibun de
Tsukande yuku dake
BIRU ni nobori
Chiisaku natta machi wa katate de (Baby)
What's your fantasy?
Tashika na mono nado nani mo nai keredo
Fuan ni narenai nante
Akogarete ita ikisama sa (Full satisfaction!)

[Verse 2: Aki-la]
Jane doe rolls, kick hot, flows
Zatsuon keshisari bakuon and on
Loving my team
I'm living for my dream
Kanaderu song like a Ichiro's swing

And I will be the first bomb from the NRG

Only rap nigga with his own custom car

Nigga fuck a bitch
Love to turn a trick
Nigga I'm the shit

Heater on my hip
