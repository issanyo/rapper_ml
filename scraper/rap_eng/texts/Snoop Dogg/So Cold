Transcribing

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg & Jobba Loc]
Crip since I was born, flip dip in the foreign
20 crip to the fullest I could never transform
Fuck with the real while I'm holding the whip
Shot some chips to the crips so they can beat the appeal
Keep the crip on mind I gotta feed my Dogg's
From State to Wayside I got niggas in bars
