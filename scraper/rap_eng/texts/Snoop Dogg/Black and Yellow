[Verse 1:]
I live a better life
Catch me out, Every night
Meet her once, Maybe Skype
Plus I only fuck them twice
Only rules that apply
We don’t cuff them, Let them fly
If she think there’s better things
That bitch in for a surprise
Light a candle, Prayer vigil
Another rapper dies
Trying to steal my flow
Must have thought I was blind
I see your videos
Youtube’n’ lil hoes
Bitch ain’t even Georgia code
That’s your girl, I ain’t know
Watching Belly on the iTunes
Niggas barely on iTunes
Only moment is if I’m featured on it
I heard his rumors when I’m in the room
Just cuz a man starving
Don’t mean he eat and drink the same water
Motha fuckas got social problems
Online got ya feeling brave, Don’t it
I’m paid homie
Fuck the myths, I’m the shit
Lyrical I can get
But what’s the sense
When it’s for cents, Double dollars
With a hit, stop the bull shit
No cows walking, But she stupid thick
Ass like a donkey, Shout out Wiz
But I don’t smoke
But you could still watch the Benz roll up, ho

[Hook:]
Models on my phone
Super models at my show
Money on my mind at all times
And it’s time for more
Looking at my watch
Oh it’s the perpetual
Like what you see
But don’t touch it ho

[Bridge:]
Rolli on my arm, what it cost man
New deposit came in, Another 100 grand
The end is near, The bible says it is
So I’ma rep Young Money till the fucking end

[Shortened hook:]
Models on my phone
Super models at my show
Money on my mind
Oh it’s the perpetual
Don’t touch it ho

[Bridge:]

[Extended hook:]
Models on my phone
Super models at my show
Money on my mind at all times
And it’s time for more
Looking at my watch
Oh it’s the perpetual
Like what you see
But don’t touch it ho
But don’t touch it ho
But don’t touch it ho
But don’t touch it ho

Like what you see
But don’t touch it ho
