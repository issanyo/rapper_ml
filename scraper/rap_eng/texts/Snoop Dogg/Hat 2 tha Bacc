[Intro: Snoop]
Hat 2 tha bacc, spillin' drink on my lap
Beatin' down ya block and my trunk vibratin'

[Hook: Snoop]
Hat-hat 2 tha bacc, spillin' drink on my lap
Beatin' down ya block and my trunk vibratin'
Hat 2 tha bacc, hat 2 tha bacc, hat 2 tha bacc and my- vibratin'
Hat 2 tha bacc, spillin' drink on my lap

[Verse 1: Bad Lucc]
Dubb Un' movin'
Eastside reunion, the movers, the shakers
'61 rag, bet a thousand on the Lakers
Suicide doors, spillin' Henny in the [?]
Bad Lucc the weatherman, get it how I get it
Going 90 down broadway, the broads all up in it
Big boy, cooler than most, so I'm the hooligan
I do 'em in, its ruckus, whichever bucket the ruger
Lights out, I hit the street like a boss
Floss, the Hennessy man finish me off
Dippin' in and out of lanes, focus I'm a G
Gotta get it to the house 'fore the spouse call up P
Can't do it, I'm so not good with the law
Monte carlo, I'm like nah, like man hit me tomorrow
I'm good, I gotta stay up
My chick wanna lay up in county jail as a paycut, for real

[Hook: Snoop]
Hat-hat 2 tha bacc, spillin' drink on my lap
Beatin' down ya block and my trunk vibratin'
Hat 2 tha bacc, hat 2 tha bacc, hat 2 tha bacc and my- vibratin'
Hat 2 tha bacc, spillin' drink on my lap
Beatin' down ya block and my trunk vibratin'
Vibratin', trunk vibratin'
Beatin' down ya block and my- vib- vibratin'

[Verse 2: Damani]
Dippin' through the hood, beatin' the block
Twenty-fo' inches, no, not stock
This playa persona, you can not knock
Got the dip lane locked, I can not stop
I lean to the side, how the playas ride
Trunk sound like it's Dre inside
Way too loud, can't talk inside
Gotta step outside, can't hear inside
The yak is spillin', the monte ain't trippin'
What more can I say?
The West Union, real nigga reunion
Yes, we street provin'
Yo' girl is choosin', my game is oozin'
Through my pores, such an act for whores
Custom made floor mats lay across the floor
My white tee stained, still doin' my thang
Tip-toe across the track, still duckin' the train

[Hook: Snoop]
Hat-hat 2 tha bacc, spillin' drink on my lap
Beatin' down ya block and my trunk vibratin'
Hat 2 tha bacc, hat 2 tha bacc, hat 2 tha bacc and my- vibratin'
Hat 2 tha bacc, spillin' drink on my lap
Beatin' down ya block and my trunk vibratin'
Vibratin', trunk vibratin'
Beatin' down ya block and my- vib- vibratin'

[Verse 3: Soopafly]
Bass knockin', trunk with them 18's bangin'
Got my foot on the brake and I'm hoppin'
Drank spillin', 808 killin'
Beatin' down my backseat with a great feelin'
Broad on the side sayin' turn it down a little bit
Shut up bitch, ride cause I'm tryna clown a little bit
Boomin', supershakin' up the block
Hop in the fo', sky blue, have beats, have Union
Slidin', movin', dippin' it like a pimp
Slow motion, coastin', Dubb U in the open
I take a puff of the dope then I'm chokin' kush
While I'm rollin' up another, still smokin' bush
I'm in the mode of a player
Haters on my line but I"m cold with the sprayer
Bossin', catch me on the block quite often
Wit a bad bitch that I'm flossin', I'm pimpin' wit my

[Hook: Snoop]
Hat-hat 2 tha bacc, spillin' drink on my lap
Beatin' down ya block and my trunk vibratin'
Hat 2 tha bacc, hat 2 tha bacc, hat 2 tha bacc and my- vibratin'
Hat 2 tha bacc, spillin' drink on my lap
Beatin' down ya block and my trunk vibratin'
Vibratin', trunk vibratin'
Beatin' down ya block and my- vib- vibratin'
