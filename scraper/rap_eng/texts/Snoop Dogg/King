[Verse 1: Amitis]
Fill it up, don't stop
You see me on top
Yeah, I'm feeling hot
When a girl has everything, all she wants is a king

[Hook: Amitis]
The king, king, king, king-king, king, king
The king, king, king, king-king, king, king
The king, king, king, king-king, king, king
The king, king, king, king-king, king
Do you think you got it?
You got it?
You got it?
You got it?
Let's go

[Verse 2: Amitis]
Look at all the ice on my neck
Ain't no thing when I'm balancing my checks
Don't have time for a scrub or a fling
When a girl has everything, all she wants is a king

[Hook: Amitis]
The king, king, king, king-king, king, king
The king, king, king, king-king, king, king
The king, king, king, king-king, king, king
The king, king, king, king-king, king
Do you think you got it?
You got it?
You got it?
You got it?
Let's go

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Sitting on my throne, mink on my back
Crown on my head, down with the bread
Cake bake, make a king swing
Gator shoes on my feet with the bling bling
She's a queen so [?] the king
If you fuck with me, I'll get you anything
Is that what you really want?
I could flip this shit like a somersault
Step up, let the raw sounds hit your feet
As we move to another heat
Another beat, another song
Kings and queens live very long
That's what I was told
And all that glitter ain't gold
Replicate it, can't be faded
I'm the king so you my boss lady

[Outro]
King
King
King
King
