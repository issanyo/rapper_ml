(Hook)
Feels so real and my mind won’t let go
Let it go, you got to let it go
It feels so real but my mind won’t let go
Let it go, you got to let it go

(Verse)
In my mind I know
There’s no room without you
And you know, you know that we
That we belong together
You got the upper hand on me

(Hook)
Feels so real but my mind won’t let go
Let it go, you got to let it go
It feels so real but my mind won’t let go
Let it go, you got to let it go

(x2)
I came to funk wit you one time
Making everybody wanna get up
This is the way we funk, yea sir
Making everybody wanna get up

(Verse)
I said it slow, so let it go
This is what we headed for
Once in a lifetime, you’re my lifeline
Baby boo on the real, it’s the right time
For us to let it out
And move you back into my house
And show you what this lovin is all about
I really didn’t think that I can turn you out

(Verse)
In your mind you know
There’s no room without me
And I know, I know that we
That we belong together
I got the upper hand on me

(Hook)
And it feels so real but my mind won’t let go
Let it go, you got to let it go
It feels so real but my mind won’t let go
You got to let it go, you got to let it go

(x2)
I came to funk wit you one time
Making everybody wanna get up
This is the way we funk, yea sir
Making everybody wanna get up

(Hook)
Feels so real but my mind won’t let go
Let it go, you got to let it go
It feels so real but my mind won’t let go
You got to let it go, you got to let it go

Feels so real and my mind won’t let go
