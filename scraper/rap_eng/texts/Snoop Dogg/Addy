[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Stepped up in the place, Louis on my waist
Party's on my face, dreads with the fade
She looking like a snack, girl I wanna taste it
Sneak up on her from the back, gripping on her waist
And we came here to ball out
All my niggas in here, this party is my bout
You don't call in, I swear you get called out
I drink a up all of the drank till we fall out
Going up with no limitations
We gon turn this to a situation

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
A real motherfucking Cuban rolling a blunt
27 deep as I walk in the front
Straight to my section, selection Serato
Lingerie models, table full of bottles
Pop one, pop two, knock one, knock two
I'm at the whoop-wop baby girl, stop through
And leave your name at reception
Take my direction
This here is inception
Texting, sexting, all of the above
I seen your boyfriend looking at me at the club
Nigga walked up on me, like he wanted a fade
Showed me a picture of you on his Instagram page
I had to stop for a minute and I thought about it
Let me holla at ya loc, I'll tell you all about it
See thangs'll never change
And that lil' bitch of yours? She belongs to the gang

Straight up bout the back, yeah we don't re-up

Sent your girl to Addy and she gon' meet
Just touched down and we finna go dumb
