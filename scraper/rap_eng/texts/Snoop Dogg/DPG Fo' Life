[Daz]
I'm a G in the highest degree
I told the B-U-L-L-shit to back off me
I ain't havin' it, let it smoke and I'll smoke yo' ass
I finally can relax at last, on a mission on a serious task
The police wanna know who's under the mask

Everyone around here who smoke buddah)

On point, hot to death, homie what a for sure aim
God damn it's a motherfuckin' shame
How niggas keep kickin' up my name
You ain't nobody, I turn the book, rip the page
I'm at the point where I'm about to get paid
I crave for this, misbehave with him and draw down on him
I had to learn... I had to stay focused
This goes out, to you know who
Who try to do what we do, and try to be like my crew
You fake ass gangstas, you'll never be true
