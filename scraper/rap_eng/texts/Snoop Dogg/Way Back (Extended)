It’s been a long
Long time comin’
Ain’t seen you ’round
Time keeps on passin’
But you still my bitch (ha)
Can’t tell us nothin’
And it’s nothin’ but a thing
To pick up where we left off yeah

Bridge:
Don’t you ever think
Back on all that other shit
We went through
You know I remember yeah
Don’t you ever wish
One day we could reminisce
It feels like we were just together
Cuz we go way back

Chorus:
Like Prince and Marvin Gaye
Like South Side on Sunday
Some things don’t ever change
Yeah you and me
Cuz we go way back
James Brown and Michael J
Like them high school parties
Some things don’t ever change
Yeah you and me
We go way back

Way Back, way back, way  back, way back (yeah)
Cuz we go way back
Way back, way back, way back, way back
We go way back

I like to think
When we were growin’ (growin’)
And shit got tough (huh)
We kept it goin’ (goin’)
Out in the streets (huh)
No signs of slowin’ (yeah)
It’s still nothin’ but a thing
To pick up where we left off yeah

Bridge

Chorus

[Snoop Dogg]
Twistin’ up a 20 sack
Fishin’ listen reminiscin’ ’bout the days of way back (oooh wee!)
Alright where the ladies at
I need to find one
Top designer
Baby can you help me find one?
A real one
Not a phoney
I want a own me
Never leave me lonely
Be my tenderoni
One hour photo together
Take a few flicks together
That’ll last forever (yeah)
Whether we do
You do
Me too
See through it all (all)
Now creep with the Dogg (creep)
Don’t let the raindrops stop ya
I got ya
This is so evolutionally proper (yeah)
Now what the future holds
No one knows
But the past is a blast
Game overload
It’s like Good Times
My favorite episodes
I’m just the same ol’ G
Givin’ ya’ll a little TLC

I ain’t seen you in so long
But we’ve picked up where we’ve left off
It ain’t nothin’ but a thang cuz we go way back
I ain’t seen you in so long
But we’ve picked up where we’ve left off
It ain’t nothin’ but a thang cuz we go way back

Chorus

Way Back, way back, way  back, way back (ooohhh)
We go way back
Way back, way back, way back, way back…
