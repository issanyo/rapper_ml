[Daryl]
Kevin, this is Daryl from Long Beach
Man uh, I was wondering if you could uh, play a song for me
Me and my lady goin through a few thangs, see
And I'm not feelin very well right now

[Kevin]
Yeah, I hear ya, I know how you feel
I've been there, hell, we've all been there, huh?
For you and all you playaz who got bumped off the playin field
This is the song for you
187.4 on your FM dizzial, WBALLZ

(Chorus x4)
A dirty hoe's draws
That was the cause of it all

Pimpin hustlin playin hoes is all I know
With my homeys on the mash and a pocket full of cash
What more can a nigga ask for
With my strap in my lap and my niggas back to back
A muthafucka didn't wanna see me
Then along came this girl, finest woman in the world
That brought me to my knees

(Chorus x4)
A dirty hoe's draws
That was the cause of it all

Now I, don't trust no ho
And do you, know that's how it goes
I never thought you were the one
That would try to get a nigga like me sprung, yeah

(Chorus x4)
A dirty hoe's draws
That was the cause of it all

I know you're runnin big ones from the start
I really didn't mean to break your heart
But you still have that good DPG love
Baby, you're the only one that I'll ever think of

(x3)
Make me wanna moan make me wanna scream
Make me wanna call up DPG

[Big Pimpin Delemond]
See as I say it, something about the power of the pussy
It even breaks gangstas down
Bitch tricked me out of my playa's license

(Chorus x4)
A dirty hoe's draws
That was the cause of it all

(Bridge plays to fade)
I'll get over you
I gotta get over you
Before I be a fool
I gotta get over you
