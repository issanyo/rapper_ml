[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
What up, nephew?
It's your uncle Snoop Dogg, man
[It's Lox]
Who said the Dogg wasn't fucking with ya'll?

[Verse 1: Lox Chatterbox]
I'm just tryna get some duckets they don't understand
Everyday I'm putting work in like the weatherman
Multiplication is the motivation
Until the fam' rolling bands 'til we running out of rubber bands
I got a couple homies with me sharing in the vision
And we ain't interested in tripping off of heritages
All you people from the past I don't care to mention
I always try to tell you that I would, but you don't ever listen
You never gonna make it
Go and do something better with your time, don't waste it
That's what they tried to tell me back then
But the funny thing is, they the ones on the same shit
It's ironic how the world works, watch it
Leave your eyes crossed and reversed in the process
So don't get caught up in the hype that get broadcast
Now I just laugh at the haters when I ride past

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
A lot of niggas like to say what they gon' do
But Imma fuck with ya'll good cause I want to
A lot of people say it's bad for my health
But I don't give a fuck cause I'm a match for myself
I stay fuckin' with ya'll
{distorted}
A lot of niggas like to say what they gon' do
A lot of niggas like to say what they gon' do
But Imma fuck with ya'll good cause I want to
But Imma fuck with ya'll good cause I want to

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a Beretta, a go-getter, mo' wetter Loretta
Dope-getter, so better for weather no never
So clever go whether or not the teapot or the beef might settle
Feet on the pedal, mashin', music blastin'
Swervin', drivin' fast in the wrong lane
But I ain't tripping cause I'm getting my cash in
Motherfuckers want to lock me up
Cause I gang-bang, smoke weed, don't give a fuck
I bought my lil' football team a bus
On the grind tryna' find time, lettin' real niggas shine
Figaro on the low, let these niggas know
Boss Dogg, boss paw just to let 'em know
When I came through the door, I bang with the four
Motherfucker, Imma bang with the O

[Verse 3: Lox Chatterbox/ Forever M.C.?]
People always told me that I wouldn't do shit
Just another wannabe, so I might as well quit
If I listened to them, I wouldn't be right here
Making more in a month, than they do in a year
Give you a hot '16, and I ain't talking jail-bait
I'm imprisoned to phone sex, my girl is my cellmate
I'm working everyday so I can live my life
No matter what they say, I always pay the price
Put my money where my mouth is every time I rap
My wallet's getting bigger, yours is looking kinda flat
Like some itty-bitty titties, you can't find them in my city
Yeah the girls are looking pretty, getting money like Diddy
Whatever I do, I give 100%
I work to be an owner, I ain't looking to rent
I'm on the come-up now, I can almost see the top
And I'm never gonna drop

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
A lot of niggas like to say what they gon' do
But Imma fuck with ya'll good cause I want to
A lot of people say it's bad for my health
But I don't give a fuck cause I'm a match for myself
I stay fuckin' with ya'll
{distorted}
A lot of niggas like to say what they gon' do
A lot of niggas like to say what they gon' do
But Imma fuck with ya'll good cause I want to
But I don't give a fuck, cause I'm a match for myself
I stay fuckin' with ya'll

[Verse 4/Outro: Lox Chatterbox]
Hopped in, fresh with a license
Like Dan, Dan with the white Vans
I can't, stop what I got planned
I been tryna get numbers like the price scan
Oh no, Lox out the ozone
So blown from my big brother's home grown
Cause I'm back on that same old shit again
Just tryna get high as Minnie Riperton

Like Dan, Dan with the white Vans
