[Chorus]
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I’m rollin thru the hood
Playas watch me cuz they know I
Shine, shine, shine
Hey I know I’m shinin I’m fresh pearl bodies in a crispy tee
Love to hate me cuz you know I’m gonna
Shine, shine, shine
[Female Singer]
Keep doin what you doin
It’s ya time and its ya shine
I love the way you ride
I hope you shine
The party starts tonight
My friends are comin over
I really think you fly
Tonights the night

[Verse 1 – Snoop Dogg]
I shine like Neptune, Venus, and Mars in ya face in ya state
In and outta cars, interstate, win a date with one of my broads
But you gotta hate a bitch before she gets your dick hard
That’s what shinin about and when you get the hoe
You can tear her linin out, what you whinin about
You want the presence of pimpin, I’m walkin while limpin
And holdin on the drink that I’m sippin, I’m flippin the script an’
I’m slidin while I’m dippin my whip in, out of traffic
It’s so drastic, boombastic, this shits a hit, Jadakiss
Matter fact nephew this bitch is a classic, pass this
Ayo locie loc’ let’s blow some dope, better yet lets go for dough
Hoe for hoe, I’m so fa sho, and so low and sensational
You know how I do it

[Chorus]
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I’m rollin thru the hood
Playas watch me cuz they know I
Shine, shine, shine
Hey I know I’m shinin I’m fresh pearl bodies in a crispy tee
Love to hate me cuz you know I’m gonna
Shine, shine, shine
[Female Singer]
Keep doin what you doin
It’s ya time and its ya shine
I love the way you ride
I hope you shine
The party starts tonight
My friends are comin over
I really think you fly
Tonights the night

[Verse 2 – DJ Quik]
Now wuts the haps on the bottle caps I want a snow bunny
I’m rick james bitch I got fasho money and I ain't hatin for nothin
But it be so funny cowards be wantin see me with my eyes and nose runny
I got nails and burbs while you got pounds of curbs, and one of us got a play
Basically around the burbs I’m fittin like a lego block, you bullshittin
While I’m sittin in an eight o drop, these suckaz tell me keep it gangsta
But they dont know, when they ain't lookin I be doin population control
Then I’m lookin for a breezy with a whole lotta soul so I can have a malfunction in my warddrobe
To not the jada with the Smith, its the Jada with the fo’ fifth, clutchin on the fifth
With Snoop be in the front and his ***elry shinin all thru his clothes and little tigger’s
In the back on the low, but I still shine though

[Chorus]
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I’m rollin thru the hood
Playas watch me cuz they know I
Shine, shine, shine
Hey I know I’m shinin I’m fresh pearl bodies in a crispy tee
Love to hate me cuz you know I’m gonna
Shine, shine, shine
[Female Singer]
Keep doin what you doin
It’s ya time and its ya shine
I love the way you ride
I hope you shine
The party starts tonight
My friends are comin over
I really think you fly
Tonights the night

[Verse 3 – Jadakiss]
Uh ya, uh like a African diamond that’s deeper than rappin and rhymin
Success happens with timin, over here I’m doin low with the punk
When I’m over there I’m in the low low with my unc and all the bitches
Lookin for us but I ain't lookin for puss, right now ma I’m lookin for cush
And I’m strapped with the pound and ?? shoes, cackies, T shirts
Uh uh after my surrounding, air force ones, jeans, city lab
A fitted that’s when I’m back in the town and dont get it confused
I’m proud to be gone, be home in a year with duffle bags out on the lawn
So much money my *****z be countin it wrong, so many hits
I can’t keep count of the songs and we still grindin, stainless still nine
And ya’ll still hate but we still shinin let’s go

[Chorus]
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I’m rollin thru the hood
Playas watch me cuz they know I
Shine, shine, shine
Hey I know I’m shinin I’m fresh pearl bodies in a crispy tee
Love to hate me cuz you know I’m gonna
Shine, shine, shine
[Female Singer]
Keep doin what you doin
It’s ya time and its ya shine
I love the way you ride
I hope you shine
The party starts tonight
My friends are comin over
I really think you fly
Tonights the night
Shine, shine, shine
