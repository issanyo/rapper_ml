[Intro: Goapele + (Snoop Dogg)]
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, you’se a bad girl)
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, you’se a bad girl)
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, you’se a bad girl)
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, say, say, you’se a bad…)

[Verse 1]
I'm so elated
Hope my feet don't touch the pavement
‘Cause I love the way I feel when I'm with you
Anticipatin' all the ways you drive me crazy
To the moon and back, yeah babe, that’s what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh, and we don't need to read between the lines
Between the lines
Oooh, baby I can feel what's on your mind
What's on your mind

[Chorus: Goapele + (Snoop Dogg)]
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, you’se a bad girl)
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, you’se a bad girl)
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, you’se a bad girl)
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, say, say, you’se a bad…)

[Post-Chorus]
You want it, and you know what to do
I'm not tryna wait around
I can see you want it, and you know what to do
I'm not tryna wait around

[Verse 2]
C'mon admit it, I got your heart up in the ceiling
And I'm in a float to take us through the roof
I must confess that this connection’s something special
Ain't no question, boy don't try to play it cool

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh, and we don't need to read between the lines
Between the lines
Oooh, baby I can feel what's on your mind
What's on your mind

[Chorus: Goapele + (Snoop Dogg)]
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, you’se a bad girl)
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, you’se a bad girl)
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, you’se a bad girl)
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, say, say, you’se a bad…)

[Post-Chorus]
You want it, and you know what to do
I'm not tryna wait around
I can see you want it, and you know what to do
I'm not tryna wait around

[Rap: Snoop Dogg]
Hip hop hooray, we rock away
So hot, just stop, oh, not today
Roll you up like a proper J
You belong to the Dogg, my property
Yes, Miss Goapele
Did I give it to you so properly?
Oohs and ahhs, ahhs and oohs
Glass of booze, splashin’ crews
Have you ever been around the world with a boss?
Poppin’ P, shopping sprees, I don’t care what it cost
Doing me, you and me, and we gon’ get lost
D-O-G, you’ll see with me you’re better off

[Chorus: Goapele + (Snoop Dogg)]
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, you’se a bad girl)
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, you’se a bad girl)
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, you’se a bad girl)
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, say, say, you’se a bad…)

Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, you’se a bad girl)
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, you’se a bad girl)
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, you’se a bad girl)
Hey, hey, hey boy (Say, say, say, you’se a bad…)

Hey boy, hey, hey, hey boy
Hey, hey, hey boy
Hey boy, hey, hey
