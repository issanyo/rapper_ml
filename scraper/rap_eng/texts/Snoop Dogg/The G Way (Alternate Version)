Hey homie, light it up

Pour some Henny in my cup
In my cup

Fool, you know what's up {Right...}
We got them girls playing leap frog

Hoppin' through my crew, after me and Bigg Snoop Dogg {Ha ha}
The side our G's play
That's the G way
Bouncin' in my six-grade Chevrolet, all day
My wrist kind of icey
Just a little flossy
All the girls love to see how I'm big bossy {Yeah}
West coast

Even getting fan email from the other side
Sayin'
"We love you, Kilo
Te querenos mucho, el mejor Chicano"

Chillin' at the hood house with a Playboy bunny, cause we

I'm all busi'
Doin' like in Las Vegas
And stack chips
Don't flip bricks, I do it all legal
I'm a ese
Pelo bald like a eagle
And they love it
These girls, they wanna rub it
My truck weigh low to the ground, tryin' to hug it {Yep}
Plus I got beats
I bump 'em old bounce
Limo tents rolled out, while I'm rollin' up a ounce
Train wreck
Got my head spinnin'
And got these girls in the back seat, so willin'
So I'm a show 'em how a G put it down {You got to do it}
Show these homies how to rep for the brown
Bigg Dogg know the raza is here
Kickin' brand new west coast Flava In Ya Ear
Just call me Doughboy
I'm in the hood
Livin' the G way, and still living good, cause we

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)

[Down]       Gettin' what we want, when we want, how we want {You know why?}
[Snoop Dogg] Cause we gon' do it the G way
[Down]       And when you see us
You gon' wonder how we do it so-so fly {Ah-ha ha!}
[Snoop Dogg] Cause we gon' do it the G way
[Down]       Big money
I'm schemin'
American dreamin'
And everybody knows what's the reason {Yeah}
Brown Superman
A brown man with a plan of getting
Rich, anyway that I can, here's the way we do it

Repeat Chorus

[Down]       You know we gonna do it the G way
For life
[Snoop Dogg] Oooh wee
