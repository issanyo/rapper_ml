[Intro: DJ Battlecat & Snoop Dogg]
Snoop Dogg, what's up man, this Battlecat! What you havin' for the holidays?
Yeah, yeah, man, you know what I'm sayin. I was gettin' me somethin' to eat, man, but they ain't even have nothin' to eat at my girl house, man. Imma get on over to the pharmacy, man, they say they got it poppin' over there, they got the...

[Hook: Shirley Caesar]
Beans, greens, potatoes, tomatoes
Lamb, rams, hogs, dogs
Chicken, turkeys, hogs, dogs
Chicken, turkeys, rabbits, You name it!

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Doggy in the kitchen cookin' chicken and rice
Thanksgiving holiday, yeah and I'm doin' it right
Pop up, potluck, full of good food
Birds say Thursday, I'm in a good mood
Make a quick hood call, watch a little football
From the bad bad, to the neighborhood good dog
Stood tall through it all
Pop state to state, German chocolate cake
With Kool-Aid in the glasses
My family by the masses
My little nephews and nieces
Runnin' around the house
From a little to a lot
BC, we thankful for all we got
Now what you want me to say?
Bow yo' heads for a sec, and take a moment to pray

[Hook: Shirley Caesar]
Beans, greens, potatoes, tomatoes
Lamb, rams, hogs, dogs
Chicken, turkeys, hogs, dogs
Chicken, turkeys, rabbits, You name it!

Beans, greens, potatoes, tomatoes
Lamb, rams, hogs, dogs
Chicken, turkeys, hogs, dogs
Chicken, turkeys, rabbits, You name it!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Up early with Shirley, in the kitchen, on a mission
With hams and yams and mac & cheese for the chicken
Collard greens is finger-lickin'
Mean with the dip and
Bobby Jones on the television
Granny say grace for us
And Auntie makin' plates for us
The whole family in here now
Apple in ear now
Happy to be around
One of the dogs got full, baby
Took a whole bunch of turkeys to the hood, baby
See I'm about that action
Rest in peace, Mr. EJ Jackson
See we the gift that keep on givin'
Praise God we keep on livin'
BC, what you want me to say?
Bow yo' heads for a sec, and take a moment to pray

[Hook: Shirley Caesar]
Beans, greens, potatoes, tomatoes
Lamb, rams, hogs, dogs
Chicken, turkeys, hogs, dogs
Chicken, turkeys, rabbits, You name it!

Beans, greens, potatoes, tomatoes
