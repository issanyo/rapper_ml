[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Everything on a bitch, that means all on you
I rock diamonds, she rock diamonds on her collar too
Ball all night like hoops, I got guys that shoot
I might drop my roof, I might light my doob
Bitches getting curved don't deserve my juice
Police getting swerved don't deserve no proof
Drinking in the booth, smoking in the booth
Your man need a clue, I don't respect the rules

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Pushing that button, P, penthouse floor I go up
Pushing that button, P, penthouse floor I go up
Nigga got gas, I roll up, nigga got drinks, I pour up
Nigga got gas, I roll up, nigga got drinks, I pour up
Pushing that button, P, penthouse floor I go up
Pushing that button, P, penthouse floor I go up
Nigga got gas, I roll up, nigga got drinks, I pour up
Nigga got gas, I roll up, nigga got drinks, I pour up

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Jumped off the pliz-ane with a bad bitch and her friend, mane
We in the cut, and she thick as fuck
P with me So you know what's up
Ayo B, C-O-D
Your BM be DMing D-O-G
She stumbled on to some grown shit
Old ass nigga with a long dick
Chanika, Tanika, Tenisa, Juanita
This a secret so I had to sneak her
Cherry and Terry ate berries, 'cause Ares
[?] my dude says as juice as some berries
Gang gang, get cheese (cheese), pinpoint, pop Ps
Marble floor for these alligators, now hit the P on that elevator

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Pushing that button, P, penthouse floor I go up
Pushing that button, P, penthouse floor I go up
Nigga got gas, I roll up, nigga got drinks, I pour up (won't lie)
Nigga got gas, I roll up, nigga got drinks, I pour up (won't lie, P)
Pushing that button, P, penthouse floor I go up (P)
Pushing that button, P, penthouse floor I go up (P)
Nigga got gas, I roll up, nigga got drinks, I pour up (won't lie)
Nigga got gas, I roll up, nigga got drinks, I pour up

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah

Mm

Presidential penthouse suite, overlooking the whole motherfucking city

Yuppy kuppy gang gang
