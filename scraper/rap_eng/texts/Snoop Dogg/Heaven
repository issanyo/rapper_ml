[Intro]

[Hook x2]
Heaven… it wouldn’t be the same without you
Wouldn’t be the same without you… my, oh my
I said heaven, it wouldn’t be the same without you
Wouldn’t be the same without you… my, oh my

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
When I think of all the friends I lost
Tears fall from my eyes
Tears fall from my eyes
From my eyes…
If I could only bring ‘em back
If I could only bring ‘em back
Bring ‘em back… and I would
It’s so much goin’ through in life
By and by… my, oh my
You don’t know what I’ve been goin’ through
Things ain’t the same, and I miss you
They say you in a better place
They say you in a better place

[Hook]
Heaven… it wouldn’t be the same without you
Wouldn’t be the same without you… my, oh my
I said heaven, it wouldn’t be the same without you
Wouldn’t be the same without you… my, oh my

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah man…
Wanna dedicate this song to a few of my loved ones
That went on to Heaven
Big Herk
Magic and Chastity Johnson
Nate Dogg
2Pac
And if you’ve every lost somebody
And you feel like we feel
Sing along with us right now
‘Cause they in Heaven…

[Hook]
