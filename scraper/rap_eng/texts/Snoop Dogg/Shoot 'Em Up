[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeeea, check this out cha'll
This is Big Snoopy D-O-Double-Gizzel
And I got my homegirls Doggy's Angels up in this motherfucker
They came to lay y'all dizzay, know what I'm saying?
So shut up, put your cups down and check game, biotch!

[Chorus: Doggy's Angels] (Snoop Dogg)
You put your trust in me, I put my trust in you
With any problems shoot the curb and together we'll shoot 'em up
(Shoot 'em up)
Together we'll shoot 'em up
(Bang bang)

[Big Chan]
Where the cash at, where the stash at
Holla'd at Tha Angels holla'd back when you cop that
Dark grey ski mask and AK gat with the sawed off
Cola-Loc to ass let's blow these niggas heads off
I'ma unload ta parody lie
If those help with toe tags and body bags
Nobody move nobody get hurt or gets hawed off
Like Jadakiss, "Kiss Tha Game Goodbye", these niggas is soft
Pedal to the metal matchin doin about a 100
Stay ready mob steady cash flowin in abundance
Penthouse Suits, practice safe when I creep
I come up off the chains, rings and anything with value plus keys
I take them all Rolex, in the crew Bentley
With regional funds - to chat with young guns
What's the worst that could happen on a day like this?
When the lid don't get pulled, and my heat could miss the clappin

[Chorus 2x]

[Cola]
Now watch how I come through, battle gear all blue
Twist you on site, tuck yo' chain when I fall through
Nigga, put yo hands up and lay on the floor
Keep cops say it once, ain't gon say it no more
Bout the cream, jewels, and you know I take the plastic
Mottorola 2-way, Nextel Plassid
Blueprint executed, suited and booted
Coniyac and Chan-Loc ready to aim and then shoot it
Keep the hiest thugged out, duck taped and handcuffed
Casualities drugged out, then stash the mask up
Ready to knock a plug out on niggas that ain't willin
Mixin anything moving straight Eastside fellin
Snatching everything from the Ro Range to the chump change
Angels came to bang straight changing the game
Ready to flippin that gum when it's insufficient funds
Bring the pain, it's a Dogg Pound thang, shook one

[Chorus 2x]

[Snoop Dogg]
Ohhh, this is a stick up, baby
We want cha'll hands in the air, and your back on the wall
We wanted all y'all
Doggy's Angels with Snoopy Dogg
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Coniyac, click clack 'em

[Coniyac]
First things first, a P6 meal
Then Chan-Loc and Soda mass heat in the peel
We gon dump on our way out to hit the highway
Save the rich it's official we gon blessed our way out
Surveillance is heavy, so we hit the off safety
The stampede where the safe be
Alive on this, no mistakes to be made
Got night goggles, artillery, attach waist gernades
No resistance to the route, on site
First nigga to play hero, clip him don't need floss
In and out time in it, 5 minute, let's hit 'em
For med it to hit be, let's get 'em
Invade Incognito, hostages and help
And they do it not block, no hits and no drills
Affirmative, mission accomplished, done deal
Operation fine, now my pockets full

[Chorus 2x]

[Snoop Dogg]
Ummh, shoot 'em up
Yeah, ya did it again, bitch
Shot 'em
