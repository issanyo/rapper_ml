[Snoop Dogg]
Is this thing on?
Yeah
Nope

[Verse 1: [Snoop Dogg]
Now I just came out the club and now I’m breaking the bud
I’m shaking taking a chance with the Executive Branch
Now I’m making them dance
Keep a blunt in my hand and two packs in my pants
You know the greener the bud, and the strength of the leaf
I’m the Indian chief
They call me Bossaniva, Evel Knieva, Sativa Breatha
Imperial
And brought to you live in stereo
One come test me now
I’m movin' while I’m groovin', floatin' on a sound cloud
Girls wanna kiss us, boo, we got our own
We ain’t fuckin' with them Swishers
So pass it slow
It's the big boss Dogg on my ratchet flow
Catch it tho', can’t scratch it tho'
It's the original fantastico
Acid flow
With the white great interior
Tastes so good
The gentlemen’s choice for sure
The right great cigarillo
Pillow
In the middle
Never grito
I recite my hood rhymes
Smoke one this' for the good times
We gon' blow, forever mo'
So let the girls on the flo'
They just left the Bellagio
They heard we' in the honeycomb
Now they want the Mardi Gras
Yeah
It’s a party y’all, everybody in here
Done that, did that, been here
Hell yeah, fired up
And don’t let it go until you're wired up
We ain’t fucking with no powder puff
No Backwoods, Phillies or any other
Executive Branch motherfucker
The one and only, from the homie
SN double O
One for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now let’s blow
Executive Branch, branch, branch, branch, branch
Executive Branch, branch, branch, branch, branch
Let’s blow (blow blow)

For the good times
Brought to you by
Big Snoop DO double G
And the makers of Executive Branch
The gentlemen’s choice
