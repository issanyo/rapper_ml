[Hook: T-Pain]
Cutie pie, you're the reason why
Love you so, I don't want you to go
Cutie pie, look me in my eyes
Get on the floor, baby you just got to know, oh-woah-woah
You're the one that makes me feel so good
Cutie pie

[Verse 1: Lil Jon]
Baby if you just stay out the hood with the ghetto cut
Say it to your face and a fat old ass
Got a lot of money but she love to fuck
Guess she can't wait for a dog to come
She don't pose much, got me confused
She got with a winner y'all chose, to lose
Really great, big bottle of booze
Rollin' up, sippin Bud Light brews
I guess she look good with the tights on
And she fuck wit a nigga, with the lights on
And she fuck wit a nigga, with the lights on
She fuck wit a nigga with the lights on

[Hook: T-Pain]
Cutie pie, you're the reason why
Love you so, I don't want you to go
Cutie pie, look me in my eyes
Get on the floor, baby you just got to know, oh-woah-woah
You're the one that makes me feel so good
Cutie pie

[Verse 2: Problem]
Hop up in the car with a winner, I ain't ate and you lookin' like dinner
Them legs let me kiss to the center, lay in the center, pose in the middle like center no pics no message
Just grams all up in the king size, Zig-Zag hit this get a drig-drag baby
Drivin' me crazy watch me zig-zag baby, just tryin' to hit somethin'
You and me to the trap, I gotta get somethin'
She lead the real back cause, he been frontin'
I told her 31st was that pop, drunk and the reals up yellin' diamond while she bails up

[Hook: T-Pain]
Cutie pie, you're the reason why
Love you so, I don't want you to go
Cutie pie, look me in my eyes
Get on the floor, baby you just got to know, oh-woah-woah
You're the one that makes me feel so good
Cutie pie

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Yo K, bee boo boppin' party
I guess you would say I'm Dr. Bombay
Tryin' to find some peace of mind
What spots my eye, a cutie pie
My time is yours if you want it
We can get loose, get right, or get blunted
We'll be kickin' it, diggin' it, body on make me soo Iganet
I wanna ball with you, but I'll have you back home by tomorrow boo
Eloquent, delicate, you the subject, I'm your predicate
Bet it is, set it is, I wanna see how I please you
Freak by nature, do what I did to amaze you
Phoneless, domeless, glacier
Non-argumentative, you lookin' at the Dogg so I know I'mma get it
Time over video, rhyme with a skill, on time what a deal
I'm smokin' up some weed, just me and my cutie pie
This is the melody, one way one day let it be, just you and me
Cutie pie

[Hook: T-Pain]
Cutie pie, you're the reason why
Love you so, I don't want you to go
Cutie pie, look me in my eyes
Get on the floor, baby you just got to know, oh-woah-woah
You're the one that makes me feel so good
Cutie pie
