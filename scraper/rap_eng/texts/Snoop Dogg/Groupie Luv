[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Told you she's a ho (Groupie luv)
Yeah, lay me down in yo' town
An' I'm lookin' for some groupie luv
Can you help me out? Hey, Warren G, wassup?


[Verse 1: Warren G]
I need a ride or die groupie that can get dirty in Gucci
On the floor of the hoopty while she loving me up
I'm usually the instigator
But ain't nothing greater
Than a X-rater with a nickname like vibrator
I need to do a remix to "Area Codes"
I..got..ho-oooes and plenty mo'
The way it kicks on time is out of control
So when my nigga Snoop Dogg comes and kicks the door

[Snoop Dogg]
When I walk up in the door
You best to know it's pimping on the hoes
213 gets the crunk for sure
And they know about us everywhere we go

[Warren G]
And where the groupies at?

[Pre-Hook: Nate Dogg & (Snoop Dogg)]
I was just about to call
'Till Snoop Dogg told me that he boned
'Till Warren G told me he rolled
(I told you she's a grooouuuppp)
Hoooooeeeee!!!

[Hook: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
Nate Dogg in the house tonight looking for some groupie love
Snoop Dogg in the house tonight looking for some groupie love
Warren G in the house tonight looking for some groupie love
(213 all in your face and we trying to find)
Groupie Love

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Looking for a chick
That love that West Coast gangster shit
Yeah girl if you think that you're the one
Let's go and have ourselves some fun
You ain't got a bring nothing at all
Just enjoy the adventures of the Dogg
I heard you like my smile
My rap, my pimp, my style
Well it's on you what it do
You got to let Nate hit it too
'Cus when we come to your town
Rule is pimps up, draws down

[Warren G]
And where the groupies at?

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
My fast scheme on them
We can tag team on them
That's what we need to do
Just me, G and you
It's cool when I'm seeing you
Get ready for a nine inch dick, me and the D in you
I know you don't want to miss this
Some classic LBC, 213 shit
We in your city get busy 'till you get dizzy
Trying to find all our fans
To load them up in our vans

[Warren G]
We hate to end the show
But there's a lot of groupies at the door
Another everyone to take a see
All aboard and launch 213
And where the groupies at?

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
You can sex me, you can lay me
Let's let that you can play me
Chimp ass niggas, they still amaze me
They on stage, tryin' to find a play mate
You can sex me, you can lay me
Let's let that you can play me
Simp ass niggas, they still amaze me
They on stage, tryin' to find a play mate

[Outro: Snoop Dogg & Nate Dogg]
Layin' it down, puttin' it down
And I'm lookin' for some groupie luv
In yo' town, look what I found, right out
Yeah, in yo' town, look what I found
Yeah, I'm lookin' for some groupie luv
I told you she's a ho
