[Intro]
He said I wants to stay I'll play
So this is the end of our date
Play, play, play, play, play
Smoke, smoke

[Hook: Daz Dillinger]
We don't take kindly to your warnings
Cause me and my crew
We go to six n'da morning, morning, morning
(And they ain't leavin' till six n'da morning)
We don't take kindly to your warnings (sugar)
Cause me and my crew
We go to six n'da morning, morning, morning
(And they ain't leavin' till six n'da morning)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
That's what she said when she came up out my bed
Little bad bitch I met her from my homie Fred
Her baby daddy locked up doing time with the feds
Now she on the streets a cold freak, and a molly head
I'm lying y'all, I think I'm probably dead
But I don't give a fuck, and she don't give a shit
So we gon' keep on fuckin', she suckin' my dick
After hours and both of us are drunk as a bitch
So we headed to the hookah bar
Man I'm chilling like a superstar
And I'm burning them right
And we up in this bitch until they turn on the lights
Ya dig?

[Hook: Daz Dillinger]
We don't take kindly to your warnings
Cause me and my crew
We go to six n'da morning, morning, morning
(And they ain't leavin' till six n'da morning)
We don't take kindly to your warnings (sugar)
Cause me and my crew
We go to six n'da morning, morning, morning
(And they ain't leavin' till six n'da morning)

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
What up, bitch? Shut up, bitch
Gut and butt cut up, bitch
Look nothing but a party
Hard times, hardly
Heavy on the Bob, fix it with the Marley
Rastafar-i, revize see
Rastastar, wisdom guidance and protection
Guided by the light of perfection
Next um, section-seperation
Seperatin' us from the section
Smoking on bomb and just reflecting
I ain't lying about the lion, roar
Never at home because we stay on tour
Till six n'da morning

[Hook: Daz Dillinger]
We don't take kindly to your warnings
Cause me and my crew
We go to six n'da morning, morning, morning
(And they ain't leavin' till six n'da morning)
We don't take kindly to your warnings (sugar)
Cause me and my crew
We go to six n'da morning, morning, morning
(And they ain't leavin' till six n'da morning)
