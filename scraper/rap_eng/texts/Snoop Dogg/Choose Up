[Intro]
Lil Nate Dogg, come fuck with your uncles one time
You know why? (laughs)

[Verse 1: Snoop]
She don't know about my girl cause I ain't ever told her
Truth is, Snoop Dogg is a rock n' roller
David Bowie, Rick James, or Mick Jagger
If you can bag her or tag her, nigga you can have her
I'm so loc, incognito, Danny Devito
Bring on the beat doe, to below
Key is how I G, I move stealth
Don't say shit little bitch
You better keep it to your god damn self

[Hook]
Cause it's all in the part of hoein' up
(Choosin' ain't cheatin')
When you choose yourself a pimp, you gon' come up
Cause it's all in the part of hoein' up
(Choosin' ain't cheatin')
When you choose yourself a pimp, you can't give up
(Choosin' ain't cheatin')

[Verse 2: Pimpin Young]
Alright now bitch here's the solution
Only proper pimpin' and Pomona have prevented poor prostitution
I pop these in Hebrew
And I knock a naked African bitch with blue eyes and speak evil
Uh, okay bitch you're not eating
Because ya fucking with the wrong pimp
And ya punk bitch choosin' ain't cheatin'
Here's another peep for your health
You don't like Suga Free, Big P, Snoop Dogg, and me, you don't like yourself


[Hook]
Cause it's all in the part of hoein' up
(Choosin' ain't cheatin')
When you choose yourself a pimp, you gon' come up
Cause it's all in the part of hoein' up
(Choosin' ain't cheatin')

(Choosin' ain't cheatin')

[Verse 3: Suga Free]

You mean to tell me you niggas is still tryna figure these bitches out if she can make her flower grow
With a shell in your brain
You the typa bitch call your parole officer
Tell her you slipped, tripped, fell in some cocaine (laughs)
Girl I'm just playin' with you, hit the play button
She said the quietest person in the room seems the smartest
I said then why you say sum'
Venom, fern toxins
Shit get her new model boyfriend all like...

[Hook]
Cause it's all in the part of hoein' up
