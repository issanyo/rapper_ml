She got a big ol' butt, I like the way she move it
Come be my buttercup and let me double scoop it
Girl you's a mama jamma, you make this boy go loco
Let me whip out my camera, so I can take your photo
If I could work it out (Out)
Then that means I must be the luckiest nig in the house (House)
'Cause your donkey is steady pa-pa-pa-pa-poking out (Out)
The kind I'm looking after
Girl is it genuine? That's what I gotta' ask ya

She got some mega ass I like the way she's dancing
Now baby is it bad, if I just keep on glancing
She said: "Boy go ahead, as long I don't touch"
I said: "Now why the hell would I want to interrupt it"
Now baby make it sway (Sway)
Just make them hips pop-pop-pop-pop-pop
And do your thing
Girl you do that thing so beautiful
Now check it out here I go (Go)

Now check it out there you go
You'll be my private dancer

And, I'm so lucky to be here
Dancing with the wonderful (So wonderful) girl
I'm so lucky to be here dancing with you

Kinda hard being Snoop D, O, double G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep on coming up making on chicks like every single day

Could go out with all that donkey
Give it here, girl don't say nothing
