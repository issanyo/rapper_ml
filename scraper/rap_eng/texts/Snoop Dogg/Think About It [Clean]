Yeah, man
You know it's easy to talk about doin' somethin'
But when it comes down to the action part
The most folks take a little light vacation
I was just thinkin' to myself, man
You know, this 'Blue Carpet Treatment' record is deep to me
And I need to let my peoples know how deep it is to me
On some real talk like
It's like lookin' and poppin' and seein' whoppers and movers
Despite a Guidant, I try to be hard on the low
Nobody's guidance, so I decided to sleep by the do'
Open my mind, try to slip inside my grandpa's fo'
Driftin' off into another stage of life
*** paid you price and big homies made you fight
*** ain't wanna see ya *** bebop, no
Toe for toe, I beat a *** down to the flo'
Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past to move the mind
Many men were eradicated by music minds
Open your eyes and take ya time to visualize
And once you decide to move ya mind in due time
It's so erotic, even exotic, it's gettin' naughty
Freeze and groove your rowdy, rowdy, girl, move your body
It's melodic, I'm bein' honest and modest
You done *** off my whole rap flow, think about it
*** that ***, I'ma do it right
Thangs ain't movin' right, I don't think that you would like
For me to be mad, sayin', "*** can't stand me"
Sittin' at home, watchin' muh'f*** at the Grammy's
Wishin' I was there? Naw, *** I don't wish no more
I'm the big cat, fish in the bowl
Basically you hear these rappers out here usin' my flow
They need Snoop on they song to make they *** official though
Indismissible, police a ***, modern day KMI
Takin' my time, chronolizin' my rhyme
Writin' my rhyme, tryin' to get intellectual
Directin' the weather, makin' my negative records more intellectual
Tryin' to change the direction of flowin'
And sayin', born sayin', "You know I get liver when I get fluent"
Ain't been nobody to change game since King came
Same thing, same lane, biggie biggie bang
Word to Rob Bass, just make the music dope
Thangs don't change man, it's so remarkable
And they don't know how to do it 'cause they don't flow that way
Go that way, roll that ***
Roll my tape and take me back the day you were phony
You're so into what you doin' but you can't get into it
You can't talk and now ya ruined but you know I'ma do it
And now you doin' it, they booin' like, "You blew it, blew it"
I'm dippin' through the universe, make 'em move the verse
Through the Luda-verse, hit the b*** first
You can never beat a ***, lemme show you how to treat a ***
If you likin' me, follow me, you so believable
Got a way to get his own music out
Record executive, bounce ballin' and actin' bad
Take my time, great mind, break mind
Take 'em out, make mine, kicked about it
Thanks to *** who might make it illegal
And not rival the Beatles and rock rockin' my peoples
And fly, fly like eagles, been doin' this *** like liters
And hittin' y'all with h*** and walkin' in my Adidas
I continue to bust, then I switched up to Chucks
Givin' *** a puff, still givin' it up
Beanie Sigel, what up? Real *** is up
On the scheme with my team, yeah, Daz and Kurupt
Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past to move the mind
Many men were eradicated by music minds
Open your eyes and take ya time to visualize
And once you decide to move ya mind in due time
It's so erotic, even exotic, it's gettin' naughty
Freeze and groove your rowdy, rowdy, girl, move your body
It's melodic, I'm bein' honest and modest
You done *** off my whole rap flow, think about it
We bust 'til we buss 'em up
'Lay Low', I know they told you not to *** with us
Layin' and playin' and sayin', man, walkin' in vain
Anxious for fame, my *** tryin' to walk in my lane
And tryin' to walk in my shoes but they just don't fit
You couldn't spit the *** that I spit 'cause I'm the ***
And this is it, legit, let's split the chips
And fix and move the work and hurt that ***
I'm through with this
