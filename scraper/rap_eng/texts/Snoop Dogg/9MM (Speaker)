[Intro: Akon, Lil Wayne, & Snoop Dogg]
Konvict, Konvict
Snoop Dogg, Dogg (alright)
Konvict Music
Akon and David Banner
If niggas (get it) wanna ride tonight
Cause [?] bout to ride tonight, yeah (Ha-haa)
Ride
Young Money, Cash Money
C'mon Akon, let's go

[Chorus: Akon & Lil Wayne]
I got a 9 millimeter (get it)
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it (bop-bop)
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it, aye (bop-bop)
I got a 9 millimeter (Wheezy)
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it (bop-bop)
Because of the law, I had to conceal it (I go by Wheezy, baby)
If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tool on deck, why would I lie?
Nigga, you a pussy, hope you got nine lives
I can hit a nigga with the 9 nine times
Country-ass boy, country like LeAnn Rimes
Mississippi D-Banner and Lil Weezyana
Everybody got tools, so you will need a hammer
I'm a pill-poppin' animal, syrup-sippin' nigga
I'm so high you couldn't reach me with a fuckin' antenna
You fuckin' with this man, you can be this man's dinner
The 9 give me brains, but the AK add liver
The rapper is insane, flowin' like a mad river
Make yo' ass quiver like you naked at winter
Hollygrove honcho, hard time giver
I'm a shark in the water, you just Long John Silver
I got a girl, you wanna meet her?
Her name is 9 millimeter

[Chorus: Akon & David Banner]
I got a 9 millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it
I got a 9 millimeter (yeah)
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it (yeah)
Because of the law, I had to conceal it (yeah)
If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it

[Verse 2: David Banner]
If I got nine slugs, nine bullets gon' fly
If I got a red beam, nine people gon' die
Nine mamas gon' cry, nine spirits in the sky
Nine preachers preachin' nine sermons, tellin' nine lies
'Cause each and every one of y'all nine niggas wasn't shit
I would've rather kept the nine Ruger's in the Ruger clip
The index finger slipped, the nine let nine spit
I lick 'em all like eighteen tits on nine chicks
I'm a suicide risk, nine slits on each wrist
If I die nine times the next go-around's a bitch
And if I come back I'll throw 99 shows
And shove nine inches of dick in 99 hoes

[Chorus: Akon]
I got a 9 millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it
I got a 9 millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a West Coast original, black John Wayne
Nigga, where we from we like to pop that thang
You better stop that, mang
Fat mouth to Dogg and I'ma pop-pop-bang
Pigs wanna bust me, hoes wanna suck me
Niggas wanna touch me, none of that, trust me
I'm too slick, too sly, never snitch, I let it ride
I set aside all my feelings when I'm killin' like a villain
Move quick like a cheetah, I'm a killa, I ain't here to lock up
I flash the heater, then lock yo' whole block up
Dip-dop-deeter Banner, turn the beat up!
Illa-fo-reala my nilla dilla never caught
You niggas always actin' hard
I keep a 9 millimeter in my waist and got two more in the car
Yeah, you're all about to get it
So quit it, tryin' to conceal it
You'll fuck around and make me reveal it, so killas kill it

[Chorus: Akon]
I got a 9 millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it
I got a 9 millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it
