[Verse 1: Ljupka Stevic]
Turn up the night
Turn up the love
Feel the heart beat then give me the club
We live it now
We live it up
Feel your heart beat then give me the club
Move your body shake your body, let's go hard
Move your body shake your body, can't get enough
Move your body shake your body, let's go hard
Move your body shake your body, can't get enough
Your song speaks to me
I can feel it in my body
I like that, let the music play
You set me free
Wherever we go, international

[Hook: Ljupka Stevic]
Ole, ole, ole, ole, ole
Let the music play
Ole, ole, ole, ole, ole
Let the music play

[Bridge: Ljupka Stevic]
Don't want to go, never want to leave
You can stay here forever with me
You could be the one, I could be too
If this was my last chance I'd give it to you

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Party and bullshit, this what we do
I am the one so you could be mine too
Ooh wee, the la-la, dance with me boo
Hands in the sky, don't stop until I tell you to
Dynamite, want to party light
Gettin' to it cause you do it cause you do it right
You're gonna feel it so let it go
Pretty lady, baby-baby, won't you let it go

[Hook: Ljupka Stevic]
Ole, ole, ole, ole, ole
Let the music play
Ole, ole, ole, ole, ole
Let the music play

[Bridge: Ljupka Stevic]
Can you feel it? Feel it?
Can you feel it? Feel it?
Can you feel it? Feel it?
Right now
Can you hear it? Hear it?
Can you hear it? Hear it?
Can you hear it? Hear it?
Right now

Ole, ole, ole, ole, ole
Let the music play
Ole, ole, ole, ole, ole
Let the music play
