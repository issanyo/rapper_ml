(Gotti I always hear you talking about this Studio B shit
What the fuck is all that shit), well let me tell ya you know I'm saying
You know when they say two is company, three is a crowd
Well look here, in Studio B three is never a crowd
Let my cuz, tell you a lil' more about it

[Hook: Mo B. Dick]
It's going on behind closed doors, in Studio B
(take it off, so we can break it off)
Everybody's coming out of them clothes, in Studio B
(take it off, so we can break it off)

[Gotti]
Peep out the scenery, me and my nigga Pheno
Smoking greenery, thugged off in actual scenery
When you see these soldiers, tag teaming
Money fiending bitches scheming, the hook a breeder but she dreaming
My money's mad, a triple beam
In my mini 14's, Studio B nigga we pulling mad ki's
Plenty bitches like choose me, New Orleans to Sicily
You wanna please, then bitch
Hit your motherfucking knees, and Snoop
Won't you pass me the weed, it got me feeling weak it's nothing yeah
That dick sucking, got me feinding to fuck
Cause she a fire dick sucker, bad motherfucker
Hoping the rubber don't bust, if it do then I'm stuck
Them strange dames, be leaving a nigga fucked
Mo B. Dick run that shit for me, one more time

[Hook]

[Pheno]
Studio B's pulling with ease, smoking on trees
No Limit be the niggas, put these bitches on knees
It's tank love baby, after bed hit the flo'
But if you ain't about three, hit the motherfucking do'
Pretending not to be a hoe, bitch let yourself go
Because you know where you was going, when you hit the Lexus do'
With some G's who bout flipping, and flocking you hoes
So hit your fucking knees, don't be afraid to expose
Cause Studio B's, one of my favorite hot B's
Get some'ing to fuck and lay back, smoking on trees
Flying overseas, my nigga Snoop from the Pound
Put me in the game, with a sweet chocolate brown
Ass beating by the Pound, to the sound of my ride
Gotti opened up the do', told the bitch get inside

(*talking*)
Let's ride ha-ha, where we rolling
Take it off take it off, say nothing

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
One lil' two lil' three, little hoes
Snoop Dogg at the Studio, with the Gambinos
Soing our thang, No Limit style
Make it worth your while, girl go on sit down
Let me holla at ya, for a minute
I'm in it to win it, see my tank I represent No Limit
They call me Snoop Dogg, and I'm a hoe catcher
Snoop Dogg is on the mic, and I'm the hoe snatcher
If you say the wrong thang, bang-bang it's going down
Represent Snoop Dogg, Dogg Pound for life
Don't quit don't stop, you see
Break a bitch off slowly but surely, in Studio B

[Hook - 2x]

(*talking*)
Gambino style, Gambino style
Gambino style, you trick biatch
