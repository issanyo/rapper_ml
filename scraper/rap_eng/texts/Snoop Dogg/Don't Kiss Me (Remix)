There'll never be another g like me
Someone thinkin' this is really where you need to be
I climb the highest mountains, swim the widest sea
Baby girl, Doggy Dogg is a oughta see
A lot of you, a lot of me
Gotta me so we got to be
All you got to do is rock with me
But don't take too long
'Cause there's ten more waitin' by the end of this song
And you know we've been known to get it on like that
Why is it take so long
Can't wait to have you, dear
Cause your love is so strong
I need you with me here!
Because just a little love, goes so long, yeah
It will have you smiling just because
Even when everything's wrong
I got you standing right here, I know it feels good
But don't kiss me, no, no
No, don't you kiss me
Unless those lips that you kiss me with
Will say I love you, love you for life
And don't touch me, no, no
Don't you touch me (you better not do it baby)
Unless you promise that those hands
Will never wave goodbye! (Can you do that for me baby?)
Promise me that tonight
When I hold you in my arms
Lord knows it feels so sincere
And your fragrance turns me on
Can't believe that I'm gone when you're near
Because just a little love goes so long, yeah
It'll have you smiling just because (smiling just because)
Even when everything's wrong
Now I got you standing right here
I know it feels good
But don't kiss me, no, no
No, don't you kiss me
Unless those lips you kiss me with
Will say I love you, love you, for life (I love you for life)
Damn girl, you doin' it
They told me not to fool with it
But I just had to go ahead
But now I think I'm cool with it
Try to be so faithful
Used to be so playful
Now I got my Keno
'Bout to pull my game out
Stayin' at my main house
Crazy how we came out
Me and him we down because we both walkin' the same route
Wish I never met this girl, but then again her kiss is wow
She got me breaking down and coming all up out my style
Don't kiss me, yeah
No, baby don't you kiss me, oh yeah
Unless those lips of yours, lips of yours
Will say I love you, love you for life, for life
Oh, oh, don't touch me, yeah
Oh, don't you touch me, yeah
Unless you promise those hands will never wave goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Promise me that tonight
