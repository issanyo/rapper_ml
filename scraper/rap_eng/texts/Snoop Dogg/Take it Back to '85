We can take it back to '85 if ya
We can take it back to '85 if ya
We can take it back to '85 if ya
We can take it back to '85 if ya

[Snoop Talking]
Lets take it back on these niggas Soopafly
Show em what that Eastside LBC DPG like

[Snoop Dogg]
Do you remember Wallabies and Crocusacks
Relicts gun pellets and blue golf hats
Racing tracks freaks with bats
Its been a tight rap and the say he got capped
Your city of your corner was the center of the map
Back then we scrapped
The G's know the happs
I was only fourteen playing quarterback
Five years before I bought my first Crodusack
It just bat around a homeboys spot
Damn cuz the spot getting hot
One more fresh vest in our hood
I stole a Turkish rope with the homie no good
Squabbled with some Eses
He got what I got too
Be the nigga I was feeling suit
Back then we really didn't give a fuck about nothing
Bust a nigga's ass off just for saying a little something

[Kurupt]
Kurupt was always taught not to love a dumb bitch
But in '85 I was in love with some dumb bitch
I was headed on my way to the L.A. grounds
Told my mama car eight six L.A. bound
Jacks and cracks sacks dees and 'lacs
Old G's from way back this is where its at
Im gonna show you how the west coast rocks the night
Not giving a fuck this how I choose to live my life
For graduating I went Lousiana and split
At the age of seventeen not giving a shit
Then I grew up threw up
What I threw up
Doggpound Gangsta Crip
Gray and blue up
The gang like pounds of C4
Fun at your apartment door
We came for ya oh and all the weed
Fuckin shooting everything I see
I don't want it no more
Gas pedal on the floor

[Hook]

[Butch Cassidy]
Well I was twelve raised in hell
Always had a lot of time
After school chasing girls
Skinny with a curl
Tough skills were on
Doing wrong
Playing with his bone
Still standing strong
Sanging songs
'85 was on

[Hook]
