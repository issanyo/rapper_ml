[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
To ya homeboys, to ya friends
Yeah

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
And ya don't stop it's Snoop Dogg on the microphone
Let me peep things out
Took a lookin' around
And what should I talk about first on the list
Let me just kiss the microphone and bless it like that
Because the people love to hear me
And they love to hear me rap
Because once I'm on the microphone I start to flow
I get in nigga's shit and the people say hooo
Doggy Dogg's in the place
While I rock the microphone laced and [?]
Put your hands on the turntables and scratch
While I find a funky to attach then match
As I play together, then I switch it
Then I look in the crowd and I see seven bitches
Lookin' at me hollerin' out Snoopy
But from here on out I got no room for no groupies
So I tell 'em to steppin' then I find me a fly hoe
Take her to my motel, then it's time to go
See my homie [?] chillin' and a villian as he usually does
He says blaze up a bud
Give him ten dollars then he pass me a sack
Doggy Dogg why don'tcha kick ya funky ass raps
So I took the microphone and kicked a couple of tunes
Glaze about to scratch and then the bit boom
The boom went boom then it broke on the floor
Everyone said Dogg give us some more
So I said hol' up for a second
Let me find my right beat so Glaze grab a record
Then he started to scratch and put his hands on the turntable
Showin' he was able and stable from the cable
From his neck got to swangin' and hangin'
Then he said Doggy Dogg I heard ya slangin'
I said slangin' rhymes, that's the only dope that I slang
And where ya from?
Rollin' 20 Crip gang
Never slip or trip or dip
When I gets fucked up it's gin that I sip
Smokin' on the bomb-ass indo ya know
Chillin' wit' my homie [?] at the show
Sittin' in the front row, never in the back
Gettin' big respect cause we both know how to rap
And when he's not to rappin' he's doin' all the mackin'
When he's got the nine you can say the nigga's packin'
When ya say he's out there clockin', he's jackin'
And it's up to me Doggy Dogg, I do the rappin'
Gettin' all the hoes from city to city
And I'mma tell ya like this
I get down to the nitty-gritty
Pimpin' mo' hoes than the law
Ya know, cause-
Killin' the emcees, killin' 'em all watch this
Catchin' 'em emcees, catchin' em all like this
They all be tryna bite it but they can't bite the rhyme cause the rhyme makes 'em bite
And they bite all the time
