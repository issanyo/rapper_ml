[Intro talking]

[Hook]
What up sunshine, my everything
You mean that much to me
You gon' get yours, get the best of me
We bout to have a good time
We bout to get high as a kite
Feel so good I'm getting high, take a flight
Out of this world

[Verse 1]
This that Clark Kent, Lois Lane
That Superman, that Super Dave
Django, super slave
Super high and super paid
Surfing on a stupid wave
Jellyfish and killer whales
Killer Cam and Dipset
Astronauts and telescopes
Can't reach by the telephone
Way too high, that's high five
Jump shots, bounce passes, sky hooks
Season passes, theme park, party land
You'll never need another man
Take my hand, let me take you to another land

[Hook]
What up sunshine, my everything
You mean that much to me
You gon' get yours, get the best of me
We bout to have a good time
We bout to get high as a kite
Feel so good I'm getting high, take a flight
Out of this world

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm an analyst analyzing
[?]
More work, no dirt
You could say I'm sanitized
Got the bitches fantasizing
Wishing they could sit with me
Have a drink with me or a spliff with me
This is your epiphany
Play it like a sympathy
Baby was so heavenly
I think her name was Tiffany
Meant to be, mentally
It all makes sense
Cause she never had a ball nor a dogg like this

[Hook]
What up sunshine, my everything
You mean that much to me
You gon' get yours, get the best of me
We bout to have a good time
We bout to get high as a kite
Feel so good I'm getting high, take a flight
Out of this world

[Verse 3]
This that Peter Parker, Mary Jane
That Spiderman
Who you know that's higher than
A black superhero time travelling
Superhuman, Luke Cage
Been that boy, renegades
Surfing on a paper plane with licorice and jelly bean
My favorite color's jelly green
Getting paid, you need the dough
Making bread, you need a loaf
Space ships, we good to go
Tell me what you need to know
Read a book or [?]
Drink in front of Big Dipper
This shit'll quench your thirst

[Hook]
What up sunshine, my everything
You mean that much to me
You gon' get yours, get the best of me
We bout to have a good time
We bout to get high as a kite
Feel so good I'm getting high, take a flight
Out of this world
