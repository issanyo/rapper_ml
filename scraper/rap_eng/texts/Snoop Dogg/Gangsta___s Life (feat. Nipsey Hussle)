The baker in the bakery
Stacking bread in the bakery
Baking fresh and soon you'll see
Bakery is the name

Aye, yo, Dada, why'd'you hit 'em with one of those
Motherfucking gangster ass videos?
All right, aight
Roll it x5
I like that
Gangsta shit
We gon'
Real smooth, you dig?
That they bossed up
G

Cause my life worth more than
The money that I lived and died for
And where I'm form, my nigga, you get shot
For sellin' lots, you don't really need a reason to die for
(I ain't trippin')
You know they say that gangsters don't live that long
I could not be at home if I wasn't really that strong
I pro'ly should be long gone
Feel me (Feel me!))

Tell me, what does it take to be dangerous
Everytime I look around, the game steady changin'
From coast to coast we arrange it
Boys out west, we insist to keep it
Ah yeah, we maintain, burn enough by choice, we smart, now we blazin'
My young home boy, he amazing
The cookie, rookie, shook him and took him
And now he famous (wow)
Couldn't quite picture that, wonder what he fishin' now
Now yo talkin' bout this and that
But pass that lo', I don't diss no mo'
I made number one hitch, you know
Believe me, I make it look easy
You wanna know how to do it, then watch (???)

Cause my life worth more than
The money that I lived and died for
And where I'm form, my nigga, you get shot
For sellin' lots, you don't really need a reason to die for
(I ain't trippin')
You know they say that gangsters don't live that long
I could not be at home if I wasn't really that strong
I pro'ly should be long gone
Feel me (Feel me!)

Yeah, cuz, the game won't wait, dismiss talk
But beef and shook all the haters
And took on the new routine, started coaching you football
To go straight clean
Like mean Joe Green(?), I step in the scene
I want all the (???) and a pitcher, you know what I mean?
I get to 'em, nigga, don't ask why
Word to my people, that's just how I ride
Yeah, since I slid the dough, I been actin' %^&*(
Some gangsta mac shit, but I did it with practice
Yeah, yeah, y'all know I get actin'
I live to merc, taste the risk my status
Top of the chores, have heart, have money
Have money, you gotta have heart

Cause my life worth more than
The money that I lived and died for
And where I'm form, my nigga, you get shot
For sellin' lots, you don't really need a reason to die for
(I ain't trippin')
You know they say that gangsters don't live that long
I could not be at home if I wasn't really that strong
I pro'ly should be long gone
Feel me (Feel me!)

It's been thirteen years, no pain, no tears
Respected by all my piers
No matter where I'm hosted at, my hands stay close to that
Dada dadat dadat dadadadat
And as a matter of fact, no beef on the streets
No black on black. We gon' be all on one track
So I fall in wild and get lost in the pack
It's like that, fo' real, we ain't bluffin'
Right now it's West Coast or nothin'
I'll push that line and in due time
Y'all gon' respect this cause out here, fool, we rhyme
Oh, yeah, we think, but out here no time
Put up on yo nine, foreign line(?)
(Tell 'em why)

Cause my life worth more than
The money that I lived and died for
And where I'm form, my nigga, you get shot
For sellin' lots, you don't really need a reason to die for
(I ain't trippin')
You know they say that gangsters don't live that long
I could not be at home if I wasn't really that strong
I pro'ly should be long gone
