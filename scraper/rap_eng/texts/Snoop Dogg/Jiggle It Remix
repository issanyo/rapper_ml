When it's all said and done
Bet you'll know Relentless One
I'm that young playa Mac spittin' game in ya ear, Got the whole game in fear
Cause the Flame has appeared
Watch the fakes disappear
"Cause the fate is severe"
It's California Love from The Bay to L.A
West Coast back up in the place
Represent the whole damn state
Cruise the streets of San Jose
Top-notch females lookin' fine
You can find them any day, any season any time, Obsessed wit dolla signs
& watchin' big booties bounce
Weed smoke everywhere
So you know who's in the house
Catch me wit the big bosses
The Kings of this Rap Game
Mami make it clap
We wanna see you jiggle that thang

(Chorus repeats once more)
