[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You need a boyfriend and I could be that
Holla at me, hit me on my video chat
And let me reach out to ya, and give you feedback
It's gon’ be us 'til the end so please believe that
Yeah, the world is ours and the sky's the limit
And you could be my boo and everything that goes with it
I could lift you off your feet like a flight attendant
Imma send this car for ya, is you ridin’ in it?

[Verse 2: Kendall Schmidt]
Have you ever had the feeling your drawn to someone?
Yeah, and it isn't anything they could have said or done
And everyday I see you on your own
And I can't believe that your alone
But I overheard your girls and this is what they said

[Chorus: Kendall Schmidt]
That your looking for a boyfriend
I see that, give me time you know I'm gonna be that
Don't be scared to come, put your trust in me
Can't you see all I really wanna be is your boyfriend?
Can't fight that knock me down you know I'm comin’ right back
I don’t care at all what you done before all I really want is to be your
Your boy boy b-b-boy b-b-boy
Bring your boy boy b-b-boy b-b-boy
Bring your boy boy b-b-boy b-b-boy
Bring your boy boy b-b-boy b-b-boy

[Verse 3: James Maslow]
Let me take a little moment to find the right words
So when I kick it you it ain't somethin’ that you've heard
I don't know what kind of guy that you prefer
But I know I gotta put myself forwards
See I think I've got the kind of love that you deserve and I heard that

[Chorus: Kendall Schmidt]
That your looking for a boyfriend
I see that, give me time you know I’m gonna be that
Don't be scared to come, put your trust in me
Can't you see all I really wanna be is your boyfriend?
Can't fight that knock me down you know I'm comin' right back
I don't care at all what you done before all I really want is to be your
Your boy boy b-b-boy b-b-boy
Bring your boy boy b-b-boy b-b-boy
Bring your boy boy b-b-boy b-b-boy
Bring your boy boy b-b-boy b-b-boy
Bring

[Bridge: Carlos Pena, Jr.]
If you tell me where, I'm waiting here
Everyday like Slumdog Millionaire
Bigger than the Twilight love affair
I'll be here, girl I swear

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
So is ya down to ride?
Or do I gotta slide?
I know you need a boyfriend and I could be the guy
I'll help ya open up, even if you're shy
She might be the one, I see it in her eyes
I see it in her swag, she be on the fly
Gucci bag, Chanel purse, I need her in my life
I'm the one for her, and she's the one for I
This could be paradise if we do it right

[Chorus: Kendall Schmidt]
That your looking for a boyfriend
I see that, give me time you know I'm gonna be that
Don't be scared to come, put your trust in me
Can't you see all I really wanna be is your boyfriend?
Can't fight that knock me down you know I'm comin' right back
I don't care at all what you done before all I really want is to be your
Your boy boy b-b-boy b-b-boy
Bring your boy boy b-b-boy b-b-boy

Bring your boy boy b-b-boy b-b-boy
