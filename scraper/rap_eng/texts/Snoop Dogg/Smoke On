[Intro]
Chronic
Hocus Pocus
Indo
Chocolate thai
Backyard boogie
Stress
Pretendo
The dizz-ank
So whatchu want me to do?

[Chorus]
Smoke, smoke on
Smoke on, smoke on
Smoke, smoke, smoke on
Smoke on, smoke on

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Ya see way back in the days when [?] was on
I'd wake up in the mornin' just to get my come up on
It was me and my cousin sleepin' in the same bed
Smokin' on the same bud, givin' up that family love
And it wun't no muthafuckin' thang
To push a lil' caine on the side while I gangbanged
That's what my hustle was about
It was 17 niggas in a lil' ass house
Destined, questin' to be on top
We was broke as a muthafucka out to plot
Not, knowin', what's finna pop
I'm sellin' tapes and cavy on the dope spot
Whatever it takes to get it laid
Cause I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
So I guess you could say I'm blessed
So hold a toast to my success
Lets get our smoke on

[Chorus]
Smoke, smoke on
Smoke on, smoke on
Smoke, smoke, smoke on
Smoke on, smoke on

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Another day, another dollar for the S, I guess I'm blessed
Since I'm young and black wit' success it's stress
To a nigga mind sometime, but then again
I think of all the homies stretched in the pen
Doin' time just to get on swole
I ain't forgot about you niggas, shit I'm still on parole
But uh, in the meantime I watch yo' back
Send you some snaps and give ya woman a dope sack
And when ya finally get out the do'
Put yo' mind on yo' money and know whatchu out fo'
Check yo' game and put yo' law down
Ya see, real niggas stay up while punk niggas fall down
It's only right for me to tell you dis
Buy game when it's sold, but I ain't tryna sell you dis
A lil' somethin' from the muthafuckin' Dogg
I'm bought up and caught up, back to the chronic smog

[Chorus]
Smoke, smoke on
Smoke on, smoke on
Smoke, smoke, smoke on
Smoke on, smoke on
