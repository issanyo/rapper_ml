Hmm...

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Hey yo nephew check this out man
Now I know you got that bad chick right there
You ain't even tripping off of her
But she doing all of that for you
She got this, she got that, man she's off the hizzle
I mean when you find one like that
You got to make that change man
Cuz they don't come too often
And when they do come
You gotta be smart enough to know when to change
Like Sam Cooke say, change gon' come nephew
And you better believe that

[Verse 1: John Legend]
As I look back on all that I've done to you
My biggest regrets, the things that I never could do
I see the light now baby it's shining through
Gotta give up the game, yeah I got some changin' to do

[Bridge 1: John Legend]
I won't get high if you want it, get that straight
9 to 5 if you want it
Keep my ass home at night if you want it
Whatever you need me to do
When you talk I'mma listen
Give you all that attention you missin'
Girl I swear I'mma handle my business
Just like a real man should do

[Chorus: John Legend]
I can change, I can change (you know I can change baby)
I can change for you (you know I can stop baby)
I can change, (you know I change baby) I can change
I can change for you (you know I can stop baby)

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I'll give up all the places I used to go
Stay out the club, stay home because I'm with you
I'll give up all those girls that I used to know
They don't compare, baby I swear it's the truth
(you know it's the truth baby)

[Bridge 2: John Legend]
So I'm through with the women
Yeah that's right, I give up on the pimpin'
Girl I'm gonna repent from my sinnin'
If that's what you want me to do
I'll get right if you want it
Go to church
Get baptized if you want it
Girl you opened my eyes and I'm gonna
Be much better for you
(Baby believe me, baby believe me)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Take me to the river and baptize my soul
I'm so outta control, needing someone to hold
Man it's cold
I ain't been clubbin', drinkin', or smokin'
I'm focused, bowin' down every night prayin' and hopin'
I'm trying to figure out a way
But I just don't know how to say
But I'm rearranging', hopefully I'm changin'
And you can see that baby cuz it's hard for me
Kinda sorta odd for me, but ain't nothing to it
If you need me to do it I guess...

[Spoken: Snoop Dogg] + [Chorus]
Yea, I'm willin' to make that change baby
I'm willin' to make that change
I mean, outta all the people in the word
Who would've thought that the big boss dog
Would be willin' to make that change?
Yea you special baby, you real special
You get in the pimp and leave this minks and his cat links and all that behind
All for you, nobody but you
I'm so serious about it, I can change
But only for you
Cause you the type of female, that, you know what I'm sayin'
You bring that out of a playa
Make me wanna lay down the pippin' and step my love game up
Can ya dig that? Yea, on some Romeo and Juliet, ha ha
I can change baby, gimme the room
I can make your zoom zoom go boom boom!
This is legendary shit right here, baby

[Outro]
Gotta believe me (you gotta believe me baby)
Gotta believe me (mmm yeah)
I'm telling the truth

Get baptized if you want it
This time I mean it

Gotta believe me (this time I mean it)
Gotta believe me
I'm telling the truth
