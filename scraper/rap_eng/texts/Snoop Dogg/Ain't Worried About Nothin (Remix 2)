[Hook]
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Ridin' round with that work, strapped up with that Nina
Got 2 bad bitches with me, molly and Aquafina
Money don't mean nothing, niggas don't feel you when they see you
My whole 'hood love me, but naan nigga wanna touch me
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Ridin' 'round through East Tremont
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Ridin' 'round with that Nina
Ridin' 'round with that AK, that HK, that SK
That beam on the scope
Window down, blowin' smoke
Niggas frontin be broke
Try rob me, gon' get smoked
That gun automatic, my car automatic

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Diddy]
I ain't worried 'bout nothing, I don't even care
Talkin' money with you niggas, that ain't even fair
2 bitches on my lap, popping 20 pills
Naked women in my bed, counting 20 mills
And I ain't worried 'bout no banks I get drug money
Niggas talking like they rich ain't got my son's money
It's King Combs in this bitch with the best work
Give a chick a hundred grand for the best twerk
Fuck the fame all the lights and the stardom
Forget about Saint Tropez: "pilot, we landin' in Harlem!"
Niggas standing in amazement, Diddy my name's in the pavement
Worried about nothing cause I'm still counting that money I ain't even made yet
Motherfucker

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
(M-m-m-m-maybach Music)
This car called a Rolls, my Belaire be Ros√©
Gave a bitch 50 bands, I never gave her a rose
Watch the pot as it rolls, all my profits just rolls
Started on the first floor, my apartments just rose
Penthouse full of paintings, my classics look painted
Shawty a hustler, she require retainments
She let me fuck cause I'm famous
Bad Boy-related
Gold Sky Dweller marjella
Maybach umbrella we dangerous

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
What is IRS, I don't pay no taxes
Blowing money fast, breaking bad batches
Ridin' 'round in my lap, I'm flying 'round in my jet
I'm so smoked out, so loped out, 20 Crip is my set
Nigga what y'all wanna do
Big Snoop and I'm coming through
All my goons in grey and blue
Right here right now no me preocupo de na

[Hook]
