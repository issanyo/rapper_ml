[Intro]
From the day of birth
As we Walk off the Earth
Lion style
It's the Dogg, yo
We gonna put some in the air, one time
Some of that sticky-icky-icky

[Chorus]
Put your lighters up
Get high with me, fly with me
Ain’t no dividing us
East Side, West Side
North Side, South Side unified
Come on and ride with us

Lighters up
Get high with me, fly with me
Ain’t no dividing us
East Side, West Side, North Side, South Side unified, ah

[Verse 1]
In unison we come together
Undivided, brave the weather
My team is tough like leather
I got the people on my left
And they with me every place I step
My people on the West
Got the best filling up my chest
All the [?] will keep us whole
Unity is vitamin for the soul
I sing the words of "One Love" as I pack a bowl
You got to get up, stand up
Spark up and change the world

[Chorus]
Put your lighters up
Change the world
Get high with me, fly with me
Ain’t no dividing us
East Side, West Side
North Side, South Side unified
Come on and ride with us

Lighters up (lighters up!)
Get high with me, fly with me
Ain’t no dividing us
East Side, West Side, North Side, South Side unified, ah

[Verse 2]
Ain't no denying, I ain't swinging off of them trees
My destiny, and my fresh to be
And I'm best to be on my bitch, yeah
Love and unity alone can get to me
Or if a girl want to meet me
So if you know where lots of love is spread, put your lighter up
Love to live your better day for Lion, be a brighter love
Ghetto [you?] stop the war, make no shots, no bust
Bust a bottle, make the cops turn up, yeah

[Chorus]
Put your lighters up
Get high with me, fly with me
Ain’t no dividing us
East Side, West Side, North Side, South Side unified
Come on and ride with us

Lighters up (Put your lighters up!)
Get high with me, fly with me
Ain’t no dividing us
East Side, West Side
North Side, South Side unified, jah

[Outro]
Lighters up
Yes sir
I hope you enjoyed your ride
Through the other side
Lighters up
Keep your seat belt fastened
'Cause we gonna continue to roll all night baby, and oh yeah
Lighters up
Put 'em way up in the sky
Yeah, we touching the Neptunes, Mars, Venus
Lighters up
Lot of space in your face
With a little bass, haha
