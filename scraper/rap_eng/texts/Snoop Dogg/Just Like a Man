[Verse]
I don't know where to start, I'm trying really hard
But today, can you change your way?
Got memories from the past, I know we had a blast
But now it's time to set things straight

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know how to stop, stop, stop
I don't know where you are, are, are
I'm feeling like a man inside
'Cause every day, I'm fighting for a place in your heart

[Chorus]
Don't you weep in there to walk away
Can't you see I'm on my knees, begging you to be with me?
I was trying every other way
Can't you see I'm on my way to be just like a man?

[Break]
Just like a man, just like a man
Just like a man, just like a man

[Verse]
I don't know where to start, I'm trying really hard
But today, can you change your way?
Got memories from the past, I know we had a blast
But now it's time to set things straight

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know how to stop, stop, stop
I don't know where you are, are, are
I'm feeling like a man inside
'Cause every day, I'm fighting for a place in your heart

[Chorus]
Don't you weep in there to walk away
Can't you see I'm on my knees, begging you to be with me?
I was trying every other way
Can't you see I'm on my way to be just like a man?
Don't you weep in there to walk away
Can't you see I'm on my knees, begging you to be with me?
I was trying every other way
Can't you see I'm on my way to be just like a man?

[Outro]
Just like a man, just like a man
Just like a man, just like a man
