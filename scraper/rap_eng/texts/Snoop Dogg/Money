[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
I got a lotta money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
I got a lotta money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money

[Verse 1: O.T. Genasis]
Swiss francs, Euros, get it in
Want Pounds, oh, I love Benjamins
Just start off work, I had a slave shift
At work all night, I had a grave shift
Money lookin' real good, just got a check
'Bout to spend this, I don't want nothin' left
Imma take me a shot when they play this
Cause I worked too hard to say this
My boss tryna stress me out
My girl tryna stress me out
At work they won't let me out
But I got a lotta money in my bank account

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
I got a lotta money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
I got a lotta money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You wouldn't believe all the money I done seen in my life
If bein' broke is wrong, I just gotta be right
Dedicated to the educated
One-billion now, you could say I made it
At shows for a hundred-thou', I graduated
To a half ticket when I renovate it, [?]
Skated like a nigga at the X Games
Into telecommunication, my niggas, see? That's my next game
S got the best game
That's why I get more than the rest, mane
It's a chess game
You niggas playin' checkers
Add some more cheese to my burger
I'm a rich nigga

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
I got a lotta money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
I got a lotta money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money

[Verse 3: O.T. Genasis]
Big chain, big watch, so icy
She choosin', your girl like me
All this money, I don't know what to do with it
She twerkin', love the way she do it
Get it, girl, get it, girl
Throw it back, throw it back, get with it, girl
Drank liquor, now you bent
You lookin' for a nigga that can pay your rent
My pockets ain't on slim
You say you want a nigga and I might be him
Friday, just got my check, just got my check, just got my check

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
I got a lotta money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
I got a lotta money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
