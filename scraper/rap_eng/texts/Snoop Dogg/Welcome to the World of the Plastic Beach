[Intro : Snoop Dogg]
Gorillaz and the Boss Dogg
Planet of the apes

[Verse 1 : Snoop Dogg]
The revolution will be televised
And the pollution from the ocean
Now with devotion
Push peace and keep it in motion
Kids, gather around, yeah, I need your focus
I know it seems like the world is so hopeless
It's like Wonderland

[Verse 2 : Snoop Dogg]
Now fascinate me
Picture and animate me
'Cause I'm rollin', deep holein'
Click clacking, crack-a-lacking
Full packing (Hey!), mo' stacking
Acting a fool when I teach
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach, yeah
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach

[Verse 3 : Snoop Dogg]
Mirror mirror on the wall
Boss Dogg, give it to 'em, get involved
Turn it up, speed it up
Slow it up, underground where the under us undercut
Shipped up, shipped out, swimmin' with the sharks put my gills up
Turn the wheels up real tough
Drinkin' lemonade in the shade
Getting blazed with a gang of pilgrims
Yeah, just like that
Belly floppin' lockin' while I'm rockin' in the bubble bath
And I'm just like math
Fozo's added up that get you more cash
So quick, so fast
All the kids say they love it when I make 'em laugh

[Outro : Snoop Dogg]
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach, yeah
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach, yeah
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach
