[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Uh, goodness grief it's Snoop and Keith
Sweat , a double dose of this triple threat
Yep, more wet white star in the glass
Here's a toast to the fool who let you slip in with no pass
All night sess , you can jump and a-test
When we through par-laying
You dig what I'm saying?
You look good girl
But you'd look better if you was with me
Get in where you fit in
Let's do this V-I-P

[Verse 2: Keith Sweat & (Snoop Dogg)]
Look a here shorty
You really got it going on (You really got it going on)
I like the way you move it girl
When the DJ play's you're song
You looking real good to me, so good to me
Sitting in a V-I-P (Holla at me, holla at me)
You really need to get with me , c-mon
[Uh, yeah come and get it girl, wh-what]
Chrystal blowing, blowing
Body still glowing, still glowing
Eyes looking everywhere, but I still have to stop and stare
Cause you're looking real good to me, so good
Sitting in the V-I-P (Holla at me , holla at me)
You really need to get with me (What's happening baby)
Ohh yeah baby

[Chorus: Keith Sweat]
So come and get with me, come get with me babe
I got what you need, got what you need girl
Come and get with me, come get with me babe
I got what you need, got what you need girl
Come and get with me
Come spend the night tonight, I've got what you need
I'll make you feel alright
Come and get with me, come get with me babe
I got what you need, got what you need girl

[Verse 3: Keith Sweat & (Snoop Dogg)]
Pulling out in the lane
They will, don't they? (Mmm, mmm)
Now look body down
Where we can fool around
Still, I wanna peel you off
Make love all night long (like that)
You looking real good to me, good to me (You know you look good to me)
So what's happening
See the night is young (yeah)

[Chorus: Keith Sweat]
So come and get with me, come get with me babe

Come and get with me, come get with me babe

Come and get with me

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Now, I've seen a lot of girls
But none like you
You red, boned and thick, got it going on, ooh
She in the next room
I slid by the restroom
And all I heard was Zoom, Zoom, Zoom
I see ya peeking
But you ain't speaking
Put your drink down, think now, stop tweaking
A once in a lifetime experience
Come get with me, it'll be luxurious, I'm serious
And curious
To find out what turns you on
I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg
With the doggy bone
Hanging with Keith Sweat in his V-I-P section
Trying to give you more than the average affection
Type of mood, that I'll close the doors when it's going down
You never thought that Keith Sweat would hook up with the Dogg Pound
Gangsta's finest
Take time to listen, come get with me
Cause we on a mission

[Chorus: Keith Sweat]
So come and get with me, come get with me babe
I got what you need, got what you need girl
Come and get with me, come get with me babe
I got what you need, got what you need girl
Come and get with me
Come spend the night tonight, I've got what you need
I'll make you feel alright
Come and get with me, come get with me babe
I got what you need, got what you need girl

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, yeah

Yo, yo
What's happening baby?
Come over here to the
V-I-P section
Oh, don't worry about
A pass, we gone get
Ya in
To all night sess
Chilling with the D-P-G
Doing it V-I-P
That's real
Don't worry 'bout them
Niggas baby
You rolling with the dog
Holla at a player
