[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Your way from Norway to Cali
This is how we play, you say ey, ey, ey
D-O-Dub get big love Atomic Dog
When I come through I gang bang on all ya'll
Blue rag in my pocket, green leaves in my lungs now
I'm buzz now floating, coasting, just left roasting
Glass is toasting, ocean
Slow motion, speed it up
Baby want me to come and beat it up
Why must I chase the cat
Cause I'm a west coast gangsta mack
Tha-ra-ra-ra-that
You can trust and we don't fuss
We take our time to make it up and break it up
And put it in a blunt wrap
Ralph Myerz make the beat that bump like that

[Chorus: George Clinton]
(When you do the damn thang, do-wa-b all night)
Yeah you hear that music it's the bomb
(When you do the damn thang, do-wa-b all night)
The bomb keep funkin ya'll
And off we go, into the projects and the moon
Yeah, you know the songs they sing, yeah

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Now I'm smoking on some overseas Dizzy Town shit
Kush weed, politicing trying to make my plans stick
Push me, too close to the edge I'll smash
I ain't that nigga thinking he getting a couple dollars to switch
I ain't your role model, I ain't on no positive shit
I'm on some by any means a nigga got to get rich
Ski mask schemes, my teams only logic is this
It's only one way up to go and that's up out of this shit
Could you believe they didn't see that I was the shit
Niggas slept I woke up like an alarm at the 6
Look I'm a hustler you could tell just by the cars that I dip
Extra features, fully loaded like the broads that I flip
It's not a bar that I'ma spit that's not apart of my script
You eyewitness ass niggas get arrested and snitch
Take you niggas looking at me like a lick you can hit
Tell you about the last nigga but he resting in peace

[Chorus: George Clinton]
(When you do the damn thang, do-wa-b all night)
Yeah you hear that music it's the bomb
(When you do the damn thang, do-wa-b all night)
The bomb keep funkin ya'll
Yeah funkin ya'll
Yeah baby, woof

[Verse 3: Sho-Biz]
This what I call East and West at it's best
I suggest you show gratitude
Stepping up with that it don't even matter mood
Quoting what I said, repping New Rich till I'm dead
We been chasing mad bread
Call it paper with an attitude
Yank fitted, brim low, 501 Timbo's
INI crewneck, I make this look simple
BK is all me, my niggas state it for me
We got heads nodding from Long Beach to Canarsie

[Verse 4: Jay Storm]
Canarsie to Soundview we're that known
The backbone to New Rich where the cash grow
Slow it up to speed it up with a fast flow
Painting a pic, didn't I tell you we are Van Gogh?
Oh, I got my crew all in it
Sipping on Merlot what a few call living
But still on the grind dog you are slipping
A true boss vision would just call Clinton

[Chorus: George Clinton]
(When you do the damn thang, do-wa-b all night)
Oh, ow here we go to another Millenium
(When you do the damn thang, do-wa-b all night)
Yeah funking ya'll, just recorded in your stereo's stinking
(When you do the damn thang, do-wa-b all night)
I catch myself thinking
(When you do the damn thang, do-wa-b all night)
About getting it hot, topping the charts
They bite so much I need a tetanus shot, woof
(When you do the damn thang, do-wa-b all night)
(When you do the damn thang, do-wa-b all night)
(When you do the damn thang, do-wa-b all night)
(When you do the damn thang, do-wa-b all night)
