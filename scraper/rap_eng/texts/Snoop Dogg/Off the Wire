[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I was at a gym the other night
I was feeling real good 'cause the feeling was right
I came to the party, but with different kind of action
The next thing you know, I was doing the Michael Jackson
I was thrown offbeat, my feet got tired
Baby got this thinking, it was off the wire
Baby got this thinking, it was off the wire

[Verse: IZA Lach]
Come on, I felt so bad
I didn't thought this way out of this situation
And I feel vibration under my feet
I couldn't stood in place, I have to say
Without hesitation
I went on the dance floor, I saw you here

[Pre-Chorus: IZA Lach]
Your moves were so indescribable
I've never seen a man with the confidence like you
My God, I want to know everything
Till you disappear, tell me something about you

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I was at a gym the other night
I was feeling real good 'cause the feeling was right
I came to the party, but with different kind of action
The next thing you know, I was doing the Michael Jackson
I was thrown offbeat, my feet got tired
Baby got this thinking, it was off the wire
Baby got this thinking, it was off the wire

[Verse: IZA Lach]
Come on, I felt so bad
I didn't thought this way out of this situation
And I feel vibration under my feet
I couldn't stood in place, I have to say
Without hesitation
I went on the dance floor, I saw you here

[Pre-Chorus: IZA Lach]
Your moves were so indescribable
I've never seen a man with the confidence like you
My God, I want to know everything
Till you disappear, tell me something about you

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I was at a gym the other night
I was feeling real good 'cause the feeling was right
I came to the party, but with different kind of action
The next thing you know, I was doing the Michael Jackson
I was thrown offbeat, my feet got tired
Baby got this thinking, it was off the wire
Baby got this thinking, it was off the wire
I was out of gin the other night
I was feeling real good 'cause the feeling was right
I came to the party, but with different kind of action
The next thing you know, I was doing the Michael Jackson
I was thrown offbeat, my feet got tired
Baby got this thinking, it was off the wire
Baby got this thinking, it was off the wire

[Pre-Chorus: IZA Lach]
Your moves were so indescribable
