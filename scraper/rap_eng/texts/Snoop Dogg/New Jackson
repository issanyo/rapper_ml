Neffew, what it do, it’s your uncle Snoop Dogg
I just cooked you up this little track right here, man
Hopefully you like it, oh yeah, let me break it down for them one time so they know what it is

Where the Gs at, where the trees at?
If you want a touchdown throw the ball to D-Jacc, yay yay
1-0 is the number that he wear when he play
Run it back to the house with no delay
Get back,  hit with the quick slant
Get to the end zone, jerk it out, now work it out
That’s what it is
Stay positive and give back to the kids in the neighborhood
From Poly High, off the eastside to the Philadelphia Eagles flying real high
Doing good, living well
And this the website, so go run and tell
Send a text or a blog or an email
Snoop Dogg and D-Jacc on the ??
On the ??, hard as ??
And we will never ever ever ever ??
So hit us up
You know the ???, rollin like a new bike
And one thing I was told, do what you like
Every day’s a fight, and a sacrifice
Shake the dice and make your life "the life"
I’m so loco, movin on the solo
D-Jacc, I’mma see you at the Pro Bowl
So keep ballin, never ever fallin
Big Snoop Doggy Dogg, yeah y’all

To the house, to the house, y'all
Real talk, you know the website, hit us up
D-Jacc or big Snoop Dogg, you know how we do
Eastside connection, man
1-0, that’s the number that he wear
Y’all better back up
Back up, you too close
See? You got beat deep, double move, two of them
Yeah, deuce

(DeSean… DeSean…)

Let the track bang
Jerk it out
Get your end zone celebration on
