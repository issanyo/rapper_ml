[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah playing non-stop, slow love R&B. Brand new music coming up from my nephew Raphael Saadiq. Yeah, it's a love thing. If you missing somebody like we missing somebody, like, really missing somebody, I know you're gonna dig this

[Verse 1]
Gonna miss you, gonna miss you
Tell me what went wrong
Gonna miss you, gonna miss you
You never came back home
Gonna miss you, gonna miss you
And now you're gone
No one can find you, how could this be?
Please tell me this can't be true

[Verse 2]
Gonna miss you
The sun is shining and it's a holiday
Gonna miss you
But for some reason, it only just rained all day
Gonna miss you
Your car's in the driveway and your keys are on the ground
Somebody, someday they'll find you, I can't live without you
What more can I do?

[Verse 3]
Gonna miss you
Now it's a stormy day and a stormy night
Gonna miss you
I couldn't see the street or the trees or the light
Gonna miss you
I heard it's impossible to get you back into my heart
No one, no one can find you, how could this be?
Please tell me this can't be true

[Verse 4]
Gonna miss you
Now I can see the real you and you can see the real me
Gonna miss you
Our luck has anchored somewhere beyond the blue seas
Gonna miss you
It's harder each day, it's getting harder each night
Somebody, someday they'll find you, I can't live without you
What more can I do?

[Verse 5]
I'm gonna miss you
Now that you're gone
Really gonna miss you
And I'm so alone
Yes, I'm gonna miss you
And I hope I'm wrong
No one can find you (no one can find you) how could this be?
Please tell me this can't be true (tell me this can not be true)
