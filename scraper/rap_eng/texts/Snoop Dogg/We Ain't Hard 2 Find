[Lil' Italy]
Soldiers
KLC, Lil' Italy, Top Dogg, Mystikal
Make it happen

[Snoop Dogg/(Lil' Italy)]
Where my soldiers at
(We ain't hard to find)
Where my soldiers at
(Messin with them K's and them nines)
Where my soldiers at
(We ain't hard to find)
When it's time to get rowdy
(We on the front line)
Where my soldiers at
(We ain't hard to find)
Where my soldiers at
(Messin with them K's and them nines)
Where my soldiers at
(We ain't hard to find)
When it's time to get rowdy
(We on the front line)

[Snoop Dogg]
Fuckin with the label with the bank (who), the label with the dank (who)
The label with the solid gold motherfuckin tank (damn)
With them diamonds on the wheels (yeah), the sun roof top (uh huh)
Got the Glock in my lap incase I gots to pop shots (what)
I get crazy on this motherfucking track if I have to (yeah)
Pull a Silkk The Shocker and slap you to make you adapt to (what)
This L.B.C. and D-B-T-P-N
Beats By The Pound gettin down, lettin a nigga Mystikal, come on in

[Mystikal]
Nigga we bout it, we rowdy, another soldier united
Now whatever you bitches need, no problem, we got it
Nigga you get it till you drop, fool we gotta keep it solid
If it don't make me dollars then bitches don't make my roster
For fuckin with cocain, fiends and powder
Most of you bitches sign tracks, concert, makin bitches hollar
We don't work with no cowards, they can't come round ours
And it's right where you get fucked up, it's where you get showered

[Lil' Italy]
Now you can catch me off in the spotlight
Huh, or VIP sittin next to Mystikal, The Doggfather so get it right
Now hold on tight, from day one these cats been out of sight
Did you find us at the weed house blowing key all night
From no cents to a nickel and dime
And if you about gettin your scrilla then we ain't hard to find
Five figures for a tore down show
And if you ain't stepping in the city somebody got all of our dough

[Snoop Dogg]
Went from a hole in the wall to a whole key
From Death Row to N-O L-I-M-I-T (that's right)
I'm breaking rules with fools and packin tools to school
Bustin bitches, hittin switches, livin way too cool
Nigga life is hard in the city of G's, key's, D's and funky fresh cars
But I found out a soldier with help is a soldier with wealth
And a nigga like me ain't goin snitch or bitch, I'll take that shit my
Goddamn self

[Mystikal]
I'm tired of just telling you, now I'm showing you bitches (uh huh)
Tank buttoned up, rolling over you bitches
Please back up cause ain't no holding these niggas
My click ain't scared to leave a hole in you bitches
Recognized by the chain with the gold and the glitter
A bunch of independant black niggas running this shit
We demand, run with Snoop Dogg and The Committee
If you really No Limit

[Snoop Dogg]
Nigga, you fuckin right I did it

[Lil' Italy]
Now pressure must pipe (psssssst), aight
And if you think we ain't tight, it's goodnight
We don't fuck with no blays, lames and squares
Gang his mouth with the hankey, tie him down in his chair
We ain't hard to find, playin with them K's and them nines
We can do the Russian Roulette, without your set, without no regrets
KL be the doctor, you don't need no phycisian
And he couldn't tell you or ask how many niggas been missing
From K-Lou Records to them No Limit Soldiers
Been down with this shit from day one, I thought I told ya
Nigga, I thought I told ya
Huh, I thought I told ya
