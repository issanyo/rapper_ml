I keep
Your face
In my mind
You're like no other woman
And you know
You so fine
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Can I take you on a date
Take your troubles away
If you agreed on what I say
Please let me know
And if you wanna roll
Just give me a call
And I'll be there

[HOOK]

Brown skin
I love you for your
Brown skin
Your your
Brown skin

[VERSE 2]
You keep
A place
In my heart
You the one that keeps this hustler
On the  grind
So alive
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
With you there are no games
I'm gonna love you all my days
But if I do make a mistake
Please girl dont go
And even though I fall
I'll still give you my heart
And I'll answer every call

Brown skin
I love you for your
Brown skin
Your your
Brown skin

The way your body moves from side to side
The way people stare when we're passing them by
It's hard to keep this feeling inside
You gotta love those pretty brown eyes

The way your body moves from side to side
The way the homies wish they had a woman like mine
It's hard to keep this feeling inside
I lose my mind almost every time

[HOOK]

Brown skin
I love you for your
Brown skin
Your your
Brown skin

Your your
Brown skin
