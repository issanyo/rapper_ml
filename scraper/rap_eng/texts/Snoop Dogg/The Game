Everywhere I Go
When everyone who knows me
Knows that I would stand alone
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game

When you said I could move on and go
You said I'm weak and it shows
I couldn't go on without you
Now you're sitting in your house alone
Wondering why I left home
And I'm hoping that you know

Had to fake it till I made it
And you try to break it
Now you try to take it back
But you know that
I've been doing my thing
I've been running my game
And you know I won't look back

Everywhere I go
When everyone who knows me
Knows that I would stand alone
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game

I'm standing on my toes
To the sky I know
And you know you're the one to think
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game
We all play it the same

As you looked, you saw me walking out
You tried to knock me down
I would go on without you
Now you're sitting in the mess you made
Now you're feeling my pain
And I'm hoping that you know that

I'm stronger cause you made me
You will never faze me
You can never take me down
Cause you know that
I've been doing my thing
I've been running my game
And you know I won't look back
You know that

Everywhere I go
When everyone who knows me
Knows that I would stand alone
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game

I'm standing on my toes
To the sky I know
And you know you're the one to think
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game
We all play it the same
We all play it the same
