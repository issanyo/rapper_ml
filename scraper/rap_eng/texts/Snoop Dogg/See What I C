[Intro: Snoop]
Uh, huhuh, yeah
Nigga just sittin' up in there trippin' off how the Lakers went back to back on these suckas
Huhuh, for real though
They say the west coast was back all-around
We did it in basketball, we damn sure doing it in music
Check me out

[Verse 1: Snoop]
It's Friday night and I just got paid
Let the top back and hit the highway
Sideways, blazin' bombay
I love it, just like LA
Back to back, Meech and Snoop is like Kobe and Shaq
How you love that?
Roll up some purple young cuz
And put your seat belt on while I swang these dubs
Ball in the club, they know who we was
VIP, DHGC, pop that bottle of moet Percy
And bring that thick redbone to me
She belong to me, opportunity
She wanna C down with this pimpology
Leana, Sabrina, Zeena, and Tina
Pimpin' in this muthafucka, nigga have ya seen her?

[Hook]
As I dip up through the scene
To see what I see
I would approach you for the night
Rack that M-O-E-T
Back in the VIP
While scoping bitches from abroad
Say you all about the green
Why you all up on me?
Trying to snake me from the side
Lost and tossin' your team
Pistol-grippin' fiends
Why you trippin', actin' hard?

[Verse 2: Snoop]
A lotta bit of green with a lotta bit of gold
I'm taking this game to the next episode
I rose just like hoes on the pimp stroll
Give a hoe a xo, she's a nympho
She can say what she want but the bitch know
I run the track mack to mack like
Let's go pimp a bitch from here to 'frisco
This hoe don't act like she don't blow, oh no
You gotsta reign, it's hectic nowadays
Bitch get down and stay down for the get down
Take it to ya pound, spread it all around
Mida, mida this vida vida bitch
It's the twist that's oh so official
I'm tryin' to leave the party with this hoe
Back out with my hand on my pistol
And do the damn thing at the disco

Yeah, I got this little woman at my house, I call her disco
You more than welcome to come through
You and your three friends, for real, for real, for real

[Hook]
As I dip up through the scene
To see what I see
I would approach you for the night
Rack that M-O-E-T
Back in the VIP
While scoping bitches from abroad
Say you all about the green
Why you all up on me?
Trying to snake me from the side
Lost and tossin' your team
Pistol-grippin' fiends
Why you trippin', actin' hard?
