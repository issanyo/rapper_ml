Oh yeah!

[Chorus]
Red light
Stop right, there where you are
Red light
Stop right, there where you are
(There where you are)

Out of the frying pan, into the fire
Burning down the peoples' souls
My high anxiety is getting higher
It feels like I’m gonna blow
Gone is the breeze, it used to be so sweet
Poison is the wind that blows
It can’t be long till the military come
With a knock, knock, knock on your door
Alright

[Chorus]
Red light
Stop right, there where you are
(This is a) Red light
Stop right, there where you are
(Stop, there where you are)

(Gone) Emancipation
(Gone) Race relation
(Gone) Most of the rebels are gone
(Gone) The trust in nation
(Gone) The time we’re wastin’
(Gone) The people’s patience is gone
(Oh lord)

Broken economy, our straits are dire
Even more than before
I need some betterness to take me higher
Feels like I’m gonna blow
Gone are the days when people used to say
“Everything is alright”
No place to run, now here your karma come
With a knock, knock, knock on your door (Oh)

[Chorus]
Red light
Stop right, there where you are
(This is a) Red light
Stop right, there where you are
(Stop, there where you are)

Red light
Stop right, there where you are
Red light
Stop right, there where you are
(Stop, there where you are)

Pick up the pieces, let it begin, cause this is the way that we flow
Higher and higher and higher we go
Through dedication, self-preservation Haile (high) Selassie (high)

(Gone) Marcus Garvey
(Gone) Malcolm and Martin
(Gone) All the rebels are gone
(Gone) We’ve lost our way
(Gone) Darkness is the day
(Gone) Most of the rebels are gone
Red light
Red light
Red light

[Snoop Lion]
We can ride, we can roll, we can breathe
We can talk, we can walk, we can stop
At the (red light)
We can smoke, we can do what we want
We be real, we be blunt, we just stop
At the (red light)

We’ll stay true, we be you
We be up way above, and no push and no shove
At the (Red light)
We can ride, we can roll, we can breathe
We can talk, we can walk, we just stop
At the (red light)
We can smoke, we can do what we want
We be real, we be blunt, and just stop
At the (red light)
We’ll stay true, we be you
We be way up above and no push and no shove
At the (Red light)
