[Verse 1:]
A G to find for your mind
Run with a n*gga have fun with a n*gga
N*gga the energy not want it at all
Own it like I want it dog gone it we gon ball
Jump in the air free fall.. see saw
Up and down til that thing really fall
She said that she wouldn’t but I really think she called
Tap tap toe on the door.. it’s the law
Domestic dispute b*itch I’m too fly and I’m Snoop
I scoot out the back door drop the top on the back
And I don’t think a n*gga ever ever coming back.. face fact
I can do bad by my lonely I’ll do a song with my  mother f*cking homie
Sang song. dang fong sing a little something. do your thing brah
It’s no wonder how you feel this way
All the bullsh*t going down everyday
And you remember that you’re one of a kind
And it’s all right that you know it ain’t a lie
So you raise up and don’t ever let you down
All you got to do is mob without a frown
Just keep rising.. let your body be your fall
Like you was suppose to do from the very start

[Chorus:]
Just free your mind from all the negativity
And let the force come through you and me
Just ease your mind from all negativity
And let the force come through you and me
I suggest we find a way to break our negativity (repeat)

[Verse 2:]
So you go on about your merry way
Why these fools talk behind your back everyday
Just get the raise up and show them the way
And don’t let your spirit nothing but haters say
Then your next move is to rise from the light above
And kick rocks to darkness cause you had enough
So get on up now and do it for yourself
Stay away from the lames and the in day cause they always fail

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3:]
So it’s the first day at your brand new spanking job
When you get there, you shake hands with your boss
And the whole day’s cruising to the next month too
But you soon realize that you’re working with fools
They sit up and gossip all day about other folks
And that’s what you didn’t come to get that dollar for
So you raise up and tell yourself one thing
Just think now you don’t gotta usher in change

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
To find a way
I dig it
Find a way
Can you dig it
Find a way
And let the force come through you and me
I suggest we find a way to break our negativity
Just free your mind from all the negativity
And let the force come through you and me
I suggest we find a way to break our negativity (repeat)
