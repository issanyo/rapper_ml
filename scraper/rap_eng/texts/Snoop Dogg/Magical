[Intro: Snoop Dogg and Timati]
Yeah, let the good times roll
Snoop Dogg, Timati
So magical, so magical
Good times, good times

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Woke up feeling good, born and raised in a hood
I came a long way, not what the song say?
Let the good times roll, maintain the control
I’m on the black and yellow brick [?]
The remedy, Timati and me, equal double G
My life is like a fantasy, so come and join my family
Cheers inflexing dips and whips
And all types of fun stuff when you’re taking a buff
So actual, magical, mystical
Get yourself together cause we’re fist to blow
Ready to go, set to flow
Let it go, we’re so incredible, I’m telling you
Have a look outside, the sun is out
Plain blue sky, now we gonna ride
La da ti da ta
No time to waste, we’re back in the place
Turn it up as we bounce and ball, ball

[Hook: Timati]
You know it’s magical (magical)
It’s so incredible (incredible)
The things that I can do
To make my dreams come true (come true)
I got no time to waste
So we can fly away
And the good times roll
Let the good times roll, baby

[Verse 2: Timati]
Misery loves company
So I’ll be on the dough low, that’s my remedy
Live every day like it’s no tomorrow
On a double mint like carefree
Tony Montana, yeah, the world is mine
Get a shade darker in the sunshine
Put it in the air like one time
And ain’t nobody worried about one time
Bring them whips out
Bring them chips out
Do it for them hoes with them hips out
Do it for the South block that ain’t getting out
Drop five racks cartoon to bring the income
Uh, and ain’t no gang banging
Everybody active, but we’re maintaining
Everybody packing but no demonstrating
Gotta let the good times roll

[Hook: Timati]
You know it’s magical (magical)
It’s so incredible (incredible)
The things that I can do
To make my dreams come true (come true)
I got no time to waste
So we can fly away
And the good times roll
Let the good times roll, baby

[Verse 3: Timati and Snoop Dogg]
Uh, just let the good times roll
I heard love was kinda short, but what do I know?
I trace my dreams, so they call me a dreamer
I’m wide awake, can’t call me a sleeper
No with the Aeroflot I can fly high
And kiss the Moscow city bye, bye
Sky’s the limit, what they say it’s true
I promise baby, we gonna make it through

Lil drama, drama, drama, drama
Uh na, na, na, na
We not gonna set no hate
Cause everything gonna be OK
Lil drama, drama, drama, drama
Uh na, na, na, na
We not gonna set no hate
Cause everything gonna be OK

[Hook: Timati]
You know it’s magical (magical)
It’s so incredible (incredible)
The things that I can do
To make my dreams come true (come true)
I got no time to waste
So we can fly away
And the good times roll
Let the good times roll, baby
