Just A Baby Boy
[Tyrese]
I know sometimes it might get crazy (crazy, crazy)
I’ll always be here for you lady (lady, lady)
Baby I’m just tryin’a change the game
(change the game)
So let me work the thang
Let me do my thing
[Snoop Dogg]
Young (young), dumb and full of shit
Lil crazy ass nigga
Homie where u from
I bang the bet
Bang the set
Tat on my neck
Teck on deck
Yeh yeh watch yo step
He won't fuss
He’ll just bust
Ask those bitches
I left em in dust
Trust or bust
Cuss and get drunk and talk big shit
Man yo bitch so quick and dip
Hop on the site like like we used to do
Fly handlebars, his All-stars is blue
Keeping it true
7 days a week
And he livin with his momma
And I heard she a freak
Fuckin’ with a G
HGC 107
Bald head nigga named Melvin
He telling cuz how to live and he a felon
He bailin’
Fuck that bullshit he sailin’
You know why
[Tyrese]
You just a baby-boy
Your not the real McCoy (ah-ah)
I’ve been runnin’ these streets
(you gotta runnin’ these streets, runnin’ these streets)
You goin’ crazy (crazy)
What about your baby
(what about your baby)
Why you ridin’ with heat
Baby…
[Mr. Tan]
I gotta baby up the street
Another baby mama around the corner
One I just screw
And the other I make love to
But I’m in and out fool
I can’t stay with one bitch
I gotta keep it pimpin
But now some drama and I ain’t with it
The nigga that used to knock my song momma up just got out
And mom’s threw a nigga out for bangin’ on his spouse
And that nigga
Now he up in baby’s house
What I’m gon’ do
Should I set it off
And play myself like a fool
I’m a keep it cool
And see how long this shit gon’ last
I scooped up my son he tried to play my wit a ghetto pass
I ain’t havin’ that
Grab my strap
I got to do something
Fresh out but a nigga got to do something
And I’m a baby boy with nothing to lose
Big snoop check It
I’m a lay him down
Mr. Tan, y’all please believe it
A baby boy, (baby boy) baby boy, yeah
I’m a baby boy (baby boy) gangsta
