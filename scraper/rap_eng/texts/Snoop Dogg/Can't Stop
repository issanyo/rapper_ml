[Hook: Mayer Hawthorne]
I can't stop thinking about you
The way you turn me on
I can't stop thinking about you
No, no, no, baby

[Verse 1: Mayer Hawthorne]
You stole my heart girl
(What a crying shame)
Yeah, a love torn apart girl
(And I was to blame)
Visions of you now
(When I close my eyes)
I can't let you go girl
(You've got me hypnotized)

[Hook: Mayer Hawthorne]
I can't stop thinking about you
The way you turn me on
I can't stop thinking about you

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I tried to fight it
But I can't let go
Cause everything about you is so incredible
I wanna play with your body
Softly, softly
And maybe we can get naughty
I'm so bossy, bossy
I always think of you and it makes me weak
I try to find the words to say
But I just can't speak
I'm so high and she's the reason why
Baby maybe we can spend some time
When you and I get intertwined
And you can let me hit it from behind

[Bridge: Mayer Hawthorne]
And now that we're apart
I've started facing my infatuation
You have combination that's so hard to find
And when I'm chasing all the nights we've had in my imagination
I get a revelation that just blows my mind

[Hook: Mayer Hawthorne]
I can't stop thinking about you, hmm girl
The way you turn me on, The way you turn me on girl
I can't stop thinking about you, hmm girl

[Hook: Mayer Hawthorne]
I can't stop thinking about you
(You know, sometimes)
The way you turn me on
(Life and love, they go together)
Girl I can't stop thinking about you
(the way you turn me on)
And on and on and on and on
