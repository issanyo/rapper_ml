She changes this
She changes that
She takes a little bit of this, a whole lot of that
And now she's changing!
She takes a little bit of this, a whole lot of that
And now she's changing!

Chorus:
She gets high off the fame
Drunk of the night
No matter how much make up
She never seems to change
So she
She change her clothes
She change her hair
But nothing can prepare for the lights and the glare

Low Key
I be ready to go
Bad chick on my arm at the after show
Bright lights is all she knows
With the stars at the bar all across the globe
She can change but still look good
Baby girl so Hollywood
You the Bad Type
Had me in the backlight
Baby Can I
[Only if you act right! ]
Baby Girl I can get you high
Girl I can get you high
You see me livin fly
Love that LA livin right?
She do it for the fame
She work it for the camera
I guess she'll never change
It's like you'll always have her

Chorus:
She gets high off the fame
Drunk of the night
No matter how much make up
She never seems to change
So she
She change her clothes
She change her hair
But nothing can prepare for the lights and the glare
Too cute, so fly
What you say my cutie pie?
Up and down as we go, get you high dip ya low
Do that there they stop and stare
Dip ya hips now whip ya hair
Roll out with the D-O-dub
Go on girl
Change it up
Nothing can prepare you for the things you about to see
The Dog is gonna prepare you for the King you're about to see (that's me)
Centerfold
Winter Coat
New Flows
U-Code
Changed the Game
Stayed the Same
Now do a Pose
Cause you a rose

Chorus:
She gets high off the fame
Drunk of the night
No matter how much make up
She never seems to change
So she
She change her clothes
She change her hair
But nothing can prepare for the lights and the glare

We still some gangstas baby
We still some hustlas What! ?
This life will drive you crazy
This one is for the thugs
Low Key
Low Key
Low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low...

[Breakdown]

[High off the fame]

We still some gangstas baby
We still some hustlas What! ?
This life will drive you crazy
This one is for the thugs
Low Key
Low Key
Low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low...

She takes a little bit of this, a whole lot of that
And now she's changing!
She takes a little bit of this, a whole lot of that
And now she's changing!

Chorus:
She gets high off the fame
Drunk of the night
No matter how much make up
She never seems to change
So she
She change her clothes
She change her hair
But nothing can prepare for the lights and the glare

Yeah nothing can prepare you for the things your about to see
Yeah we're the ones they're trying to be
And it's all in high definition

And now she's changing

She's changing right before my eyes
