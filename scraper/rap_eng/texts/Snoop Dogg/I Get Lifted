Good morning niff-nods and stoners
I would like to welcome you to Nathanael Hill High School
The home of the scholars, the home of the impalas
And the home of the Rottweilers
I'm your counselor, Warren G

[Chorus]
I'm just soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday
I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday
I get lifted, I get lifted, hey

Overzel me, propel me, propeller, cat pilla
Rap healer, dope dealer, grip it back
Lick it back now, reseller
Exhale, inhaler, feller, Juice is poured
Deuces for all you loud mouth bitches who adore
I can't play on your field anymore
Take it flight, now look at me soar
In and out of space with my foot to the floor
Higher and higher, I won't retire
Halfie don Kaya, Love smokin' fire tata like satellite
All on the wire
Keep it up, speed it up, slow it up throw it up
Your bitch is looking at me cause she probably wanna go with us
It's cool with me, hop in, hop in, ain't no stopping
We keep knocking, rocking

[Chorus]
Dimes, dubs, quarter ounce oz, put it in the zag
Let it burn slowly, everywhere I am
Nigga got a blow tree rolling every gram
They be like holy smokes, that man no joke
Can tell if it's that "ehh" if he don't choke
Never gonna quit, every chance I'm a toke
Zips smelling like the whole plant in my coat
Fam I don' smoked fans weed and bought bags for autographs
Coming at me with all the names of what I gotta have
I got my own shit, and this ain't for the little kid
This grown shit, having a party at my crib
Bring your own bitch, I got three, so matter of fact you can take one
And roll a joint baby girl let's bake one
And take this weed and I can show you how to make one, ah

I'm just soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees

Niggas know I get lifted it's high school
I stay high, I mean I don't gotta get high I'm already there
Yeah, I was high when I said that, haha, whatup snoop!

Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday
I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday
I get lifted, I get lifted, hey

I'm just soaking up the breeze, smoking on some cheese
I blame it on you, you blame it on me, we blame it on trees
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
I blame it on you, you blame it on me, we blame it on trees

I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday
I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday
I get lifted, I get lifted, hey
