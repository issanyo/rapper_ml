[Hook 1: Marvin Gaye]
Get up and...ohhh....party, yeah

Groovy baby, sing a song, get up and, and party, ooh, come on girl

[Snoop Dogg]
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg] (Marvin continues in background)
Can't you hear what I hear, that's the sound
Of the voice that you haven't heard in a while
It makes you wanna do the bumpin
I'm starvin', I went and got Marvin
I see the rap game is just augin
And at times, I'm the main target
Hey yo Marvin, what you feel about it
And what you think your nephew Snoopy Snoop should do about it

[Hook 2: Marvin Gaye]
Get up and...ohhh....party, yeah (Snoop and Marvin, Marv and Snoopy)
I wanna sing a song, get up, and party (together at last)
Baby come on, come on girl

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg] (Marvin in background)
It's a party over here
But I don't really know
What the party is a go
Cuz they trippin' at the front door
Let it go, slide in slow
But I really don't know cuz I'm tryin to hit the dance floor
And then I'm gonna go to the motel
Hands in the air cuz you know I don't care
Hey yo Marvin, what you feel about it
And what you think your nephew Snoopy Snoop should do about it

[Hook 3: Marvin Gaye]
Get up and ohhh party, yeah (Snoop and Marvin, Marv and Snoopy)
I wanna sing a song, and party (together at least)
Baby come on, come on (and party, yeah)
Get up and ohh party, yeah (sing a song, get up)

[Snoop Dogg]
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me (yeah)

[Marvin Gaye]
Groovy baby, sing a song, get up, and party

[Snoop Dogg]
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
No matter where you at
If you white, if you black
If you don't like me

This is somethin to groove to, to move to
Made to move you, ensue you, Snoop do
What I do, keep it true, and ball through
What I make may can take years on you
Hey yo Marvin, what you feel about it
And what you think your nephew Snoopy Snoop should do about it
