This one ya hear

[Hook - Mr. Vegas]
Fruit juice
Number one you know me can’t lose
Inna my garden me pick the fruit that me choose
Fruit juice in my glass you know me can’t lose
Take away my worry, my stress, and my blues

[PreHook]
Higher level natural vibes are what me give dem
My princess say she love it when we ride pon rhythm
Natural berries are so very good for the system
Some tart, some sweet, you just can’t resist them

[Verse 1]
Sweetsop, neesberries, cantaloupes, soursop
Pineapple, mango, my taste buds tangle
An ice cold beverage in my honeycomb hideout
Chillin’ with my beautiful empress we a standout

[PreHook & Hook]

[Verse 2]
She sip the beet juice, said she really love the medicine
Drink it down slow feel the good vibe settling
The way the flavors going down
She ordered up another round
Tell me that she feel alright
Natural juices over Sprite
Feel the guava juice
She have a healthy appetite
No drink the red bull
Because she don’t believe the hype
(Feel the guava juice

[Verse 3 - Mr. Vegas]
(But this a perfect connect, true)
Pick up the empress
Then we-ah drink up the fruit
Juice cause too much soda make ya big, fat, and loose
Blend up the sour sop, the carrot, and the root
They give all dem love Mr. Vegas and, Snoop
We no give y’all syrup cause that can’t make no youth
Give all dem some me juice grab and a loot
Say dem want a sample, of the arrow root-a
Dem a say me strong inna the root-a
Oy, Oy Oy Oy Oy
Oy Oy Oy Oy, Oy Oy Oy Oy Oy Oy
Don’t want no soda pop in my cup
Natural juices, rasta come up

[Hook]
