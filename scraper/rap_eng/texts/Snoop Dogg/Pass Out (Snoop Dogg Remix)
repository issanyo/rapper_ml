[Intro: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, It's okay, I'm good
Lets go

[Hook: Tinie Tempah and Labrinth]
Yeah, yeah we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast a celebration get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out
So, let it rain
Let it pour away (yeah)
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground, yeah, pass out

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah I'm in charge now
I'm a star and I bought my fucking cast out
I live a very very very wild lifestyle
Heidi and Audrina eat your heart out
I used to listen to you, don't wanna bring arms out
I've got so many clothes I keep some in my aunts house
Disturbing London baby we about to branch out
Soon I'll be the king like Prince Charles child
Yeah, yeah and there ain't nobody fresher
Semester to semester, ravin' with the freshers
Twenty light bulbs around my table and my dresser
CLC Kompressor, just in case that don't impress her
Say hello to Dexter, say hello to uncle Fester
Got 'em gazing at my necklace and my crazy sun protectors
G-Shocks I got a crazy gun collection
Haters, I can't fuckin' hear your reception

[Hook: Tinie Tempah and Labrinth]
Yeah, yeah we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast a celebration get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out
So, let it rain
Let it pour away (yeah)
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground, yeah, pass out

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Trip this, sip this, hold on for a second
Yeah, you can't for I got something to say
You know who it is
It's the one and only
Baby pop your ass out
Gonna put your glass out
So we gonna blow for sure until you pass out
I'm like Slick Rick, I'm old school from back in the day
See they didn't let the big Dogg back up in the UK
Now you know I party hearty and play
A landy sipper, Tinie Tempah, pick up awry
Glastonbury, oh limbo lay
You motherfuckers gonna remember me
I'm like The Beatles with needles me and my peoples are legal
We drop a heaters fajitas, you mean fajitas to peelers
And Virgin Airlines, that's how they greet us
They had to join us, they knew they couldn't beat us
Draped in my adidas like running in
And the gangsters not sounding like they ain't running it
You know who to call on the gangster man
To smoke that weed till I fall on my back

[Hook: Tinie Tempah and Labrinth]
Yeah, yeah we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast a celebration get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out
So, let it rain
Let it pour away (yeah)
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground, yeah, pass out

[Bridge: Labrinth and Tinie Tempah]
Woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Uh, look at me I been a cheeky bastard, man I am
Look at all the drama we started, now I am
In here layin' on my back, sayin' DJ
Won't ya gimmie one more track
I'll apologize for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologize for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologize for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologize for tonight, tomorrow morning

[Chorus: Labrinth and Tinie Tempah]
So let it rain
Let it pour away
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out
So let it rain
Let it pour away
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

[Outro: Kids and Tinie Tempah]
Pass out
Pass out
Pass out
Pass out
Pass out
