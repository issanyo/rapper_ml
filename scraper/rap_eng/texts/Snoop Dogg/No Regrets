Feat. T.I

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Hard times and good times... when they're mixed together
It can only make you stronger... even live a little longer
I see the Gs on the corner, holding steel, think they're real
But oh, it's only a short life...
Pennies on their eyes cause they won't see tomorrow

[Hook]
Sometimes, I wanna run away, but I'm holding on to what I feel
In this life, we don't crush no deals, back in the day
Back in the day when I used to be a mindless kid
Now I'm on that holy bid, no regrets for the things I did
It's the only way, only way, only way...
To live with no regrets...
You know you'd better live with no regrets

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You can roll up your problems, smoke 'em like a champion
You can pray for a miracle, and still nothing can happen
I ain't never bid us over, and I'm no predictor of the future
But I know, it's a short life...
Pennies on their eyes cause they won't see tomorrow

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
15 with kingpin, kilogram dreams - money talks
You ain't talkin' money, G,? Well we ain't talkin' 'bout a damn thing
(You know) Whip it 'til it's hard, serve it to the dope fiend
(You know) Or bring me 21-5, get a whole thing
On triple-beams they weigh up
You owe me, homie? Best pay up
Don't make me raise this AK up
You and your homie get sprayed up
My lifestyle wild - he ain't got a clue
Don't let this smile fool you, bruh, this what you'd better do:
Give me my R-E-S-P-E-C-T
'Fore I leave you D-O-A, you won't need no D-O-C
About my D-O-G, I swear to G-O-D
I push that line with no regrets, I won't lose one night's sleep

[Hook]
