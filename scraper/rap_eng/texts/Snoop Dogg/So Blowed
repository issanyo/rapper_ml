[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I said I’m ready for the weekend
So you know what it is
A little herb for the season
We gon' roll up again

[Hook: B.o.B]
I wanna get high, so blowed tonight
I wanna get high, so blowed tonight
So high
So high

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Chilling in the backseat
Everything loud
We walkin' the door and they reachin' forward, they can’t ignore
Sparkles on the bottles, girls going wild
A night like this won’t end so fast that good

[Hook: B.o.B]

[Verse 3: Snoop Lion]
Buckle your seatbelts, enjoy the ride
This is a mission for the missin', information’s advised
Ladies, come with me and then take it easy
Here’s a bleezy for you and your friend, I light it up
All I know is that we bout to get blowed
You’da sit knack back
Now baby girl let’s roll, I let my mind go with the whirl
But then blaze up the change up
The game up, raise up
Final leave minor league, now I’m living major
Sittin' on smoke alarms like the sky pager, Ali and Fraser
Smoke rains appear, the king is here
Power to the people

[Hook: B.o.B]

I wanna get high
So blowed
I wanna get high
So blowed, so blowed, so blowed, so blowed
So blowed
I wanna get high
So blowed
So high
So high
High
High
