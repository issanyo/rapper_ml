[Verse 1]
Dem'a walk and a'talk bout this a'one
Dem'a laugh and go on bout dat'a one
Hey, what you want you can't getty, getty
And the problem will get real dretty, dretty

You reap what you sow
Can’t plant the corn when the peas want fi grow, no

Dem'a spread dirty lies, them'a no me friend
Throw a stone in'a the high bin
And the one who squealed on him will have a problem
Hey, who feels it knows
And I suppose them heart made out of stone hoo
You reap what you sow
But it'll go nowhere, but are bound to drop off, ting
Who feels it knows, and I suppose that you never know ohh
You reap what you sow
Can’t plant the corn when the peas want fi grow, nooo

[Hook]
