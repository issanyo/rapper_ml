[Chorus: Snap Dogg]
You gotta be a dog to fight and not run
You gotta be a dog to make it up out the slums
You gotta be a dog to make it out where I'm from
You gotta be a dog to take everything you want
You gotta be a dog (this for all my dogs, this for all my dogs)
You gotta be a dog (this for all my dogs, this for all my dogs)
You gotta be a dog (this for all my dogs, this for all my dogs)
You gotta be a dog (this for all my dogs, this for all my dogs)
You gotta be a dog

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Big dog nigga, and I do this for life
With my hands in the sky, Omega Psi Phi
Don't try to dare pick a bone with me
You'll get popped, so it's best you get along with me
And try to figure out how to get this paper bag servin' late
See, me and my dogs, we made reservations
New whip, new ship, renovations
Rebuildin' the hood, public relations
Stomp down deep, when I walk loc
And everybody listen when I talk loc
Never been scary, fuck the owner, beware of the dog
'Cause I'm killin' if it's necessary

[Chorus: Snap Dogg]
You gotta be a dog to fight and not run
You gotta be a dog to make it up out the slums
You gotta be a dog to make it out where I'm from
You gotta be a dog to take everything you want
You gotta be a dog (this for all my dogs, this for all my dogs)
You gotta be a dog (this for all my dogs, this for all my dogs)
You gotta be a dog (this for all my dogs, this for all my dogs)
You gotta be a dog (this for all my dogs, this for all my dogs)
You gotta be a dog

[Verse 2: Snapp Dogg]
Look me in my eyes, you can tell that I'ma ride
Hear the pain in my voice and you know I'm down to slide
Nigga I ain't got a choice, I'm a dog, that's what dogs do
You'll get bit if you try to touch a dog's food
Eatin' real good, I need some food for my dogs too
Leader of the pack, when I move all my dogs move
Still hittin' hoes from the back, like a dog do
I don't care if she bougie, I'ma still dog you
Free all of my dogs too, let all of my dogs loose
Shoutout all my dogs gettin' rich off that dog food
Scared, everybody stand still when the dog move
You ain't gotta call, you my dog, you can fall through

[Chorus: Snap Dogg]
You gotta be a dog to fight and not run
You gotta be a dog to make it up out the slums
You gotta be a dog to make it out where I'm from
You gotta be a dog to take everything you want
You gotta be a dog (this for all my dog, this for all my dogs)
You gotta be a dog (this for all my dog, this for all my dogs)
You gotta be a dog (this for all my dog, this for all my dogs)
You gotta be a dog (this for all my dog, this for all my dogs)
You gotta be a dog
