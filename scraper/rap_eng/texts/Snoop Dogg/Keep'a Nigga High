[Verse 1]
Hold up, load up, no need for talkin baby just roll up
It’s me and you, I’m who you catta to
This pimpin is so real, I make her do
What her mama and her granny was afraid to
Executive branch, bitch I made you
I got the wheel, baby pop the pill
Took her for a ride through Beverly Hills
Poppin the P, on a shoppin spree
Playin these bitches like Monopoly
But done all so properly
Manipulate mass, mockery
Coppin low, coppin plea
Knockin new bitches while I’m rockin the V
Cockin my heat, set it on my lap
And bang this new slap, ride the 7-6 like a stone
I only eat the bird if it’s golden

[Verse 2]
Passenger seat fat asses
Outer classes got the sounds and it’s blastin
Banged up bang up hit it like
G’s up winch I get it right
Look I ain’t with the pictures
I’m here to get ya hit ya and get my little issue
Then slip right back to the honey cone
Lay a verse down get my money on
Now I’m gone blew up half a zone
Left you with a face full of chromosomes
Twist that sack
And if you suck good dick I’ll get right back
But other than that you niggas be lovin the rack
I had a bitch from the CPT
Used to love to dip with a crip
And she love when I spit this shit like biatch

[Verse 3]
She be on the top, she be so dramatical
Way she bend over, she’s so acrobatical
Flop ‘em, flip ‘em, rub ‘em down
She go coo coo for cocoa puff, bang that thing around
Like 1 hit, 2 hit, pop 1, pop 2
Peeka boo, molly girl
Oh shit, we got you
I’m in the zone, zoning and I’m blastin
It’s smoking in the club, non-smokers gets handsy
We go faster faster then we go slower
We don’t stop, you know we keep going
Party over here, party over there
Bad bitches to smoke, homeboy we there
It’s 3 o’clock in the morning
I’m on it girl, you all on me
You know you want me, pre rolls is on me
Too many girls, for saying that you lonely
