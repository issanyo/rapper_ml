[Intro: Snoop Lion]
Hedidi-bumpedum-badum-badum
Bada-badum-ba-bada-badum
Hedidi-bumpedum-badum-badum

[Hook: Snoop Lion]
Got to get away
Got to get away
To a place I love
To a place I love
Dumdidi-dum-skedi-dum-dum-dum
Got to get away
Got to get away
To a place I love
(I say) To a place I love
(Get your hands up!)

[Verse 1: Angela Hunte]
Turn them clips
Cause when them boys in my shoes
Then Iâ€™m missing on a dark play
Cause when you at them and tell them and the gun fill them belly
And grown enough so you can be the last living crew for the youth warriors
The youth warriors
Shoot [x16]

[Hook]

[Interlude: Snoop Lion] x4
You gonna have to jump on it, you gonna have to lift it

[Verse 2: Angela Hunte]
Cause when you at them and tell them, and the gun fill them belly
And grown enough so you can be the last living crew for the euphorias
The euphorias
Shoot [x17]

[Hook]
