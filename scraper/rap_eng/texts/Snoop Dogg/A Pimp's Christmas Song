[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah this Pimps Christmas
Yeah this Pimps Christmas
Yeah this Pimps Christmas
Yeah this Pimps Christmas
December 25th a pimp Christmas
Let me check my gift list, I'm on some pimp shit
Yes indeed, I proceed to roll up the trees
Snoopy DO-Double G aw nigga please
Let me show you how it is what we lookin' for
We tryna get the dough I'm at the liqour store
I'm tryna crack a hoe, you know I'm gettin' dough
I'm in a Bentley you know that motherfucker snow
It's all white delight, you know its extra tight
I'm tryna crack a bitch til I get my money right
You know I'm extra tight, I'm takin' hella flight
Catch a bad bitch I'm just like Dolomite
It's a pimp Christmas, that's what it is nigga
