[Intro - Charlie Wilson]
Good god y'all

[Snoop Dogg]
The selection, with perfection, is more than affection
Are you infectious, yes you are
Uncle Charlie, do the honours

[Verse 1 - Charlie]
Baby girl
Lips so red they call you Maybelline
Rock my world
Looks could kill you knock me off my feet

[Bridge - Snoop]
Can you get em on the runway?
Yes you can
Can you hurt em with the bonglife?
Yes you can
Can you make em have it your way?
Yes you can (x3)

[Hook 1 - Charlie]
She's so infectious
She's dancing reckless
She's shaking, baking
Good lord ow!
She's so infectious
She's dancing reckless
She's interstaging
Good lord ow!

[Hook 2 - Snoop]
Get it baby
Get get it baby
Get get it baby
One time, ow!
Get it baby
Get get it baby
Get get it baby
Two times, ow!

[Verse 2 - Charlie]
Diamond girl
Eyes so white they shine like Tiffany's
Such a flirt
Teasing when you walk in front of me

[Bridge]

[Hook 1 & 2]

[Verse 3 - Charlie]
Ooh you look so stunning
You got my engine running
Baby girl you know you're only mine
You know you're so infectious
Blowing up my senses
Baby girl you're playing with my mind

[Verse 4 - Snoop]
To kiss your lips, dip, slip into a zone
2, 1, 3, 5, 4 home alone
Infectious, gold tips with the chrome
Nick nack paddy wack, give me my bone
I want you and I know that you
Want me too so let's just do once
Own your mind, take your time girl
And put that thing on me
I never wanted to fall in love
But who's to say
You never wanted to fall in love
But you fell for me anyway
I'm this, I'm that, I'm back on point
Heat by my thigh, you by my side
For sure, you go
Uncle Charlie let em know

[Bridge 2 - Charlie]
She's sooo infectious

[Hook 1 x2]

[Hook 2 x2]

[Outro - Charlie]
Shes so infectious (x2)
Infectious
