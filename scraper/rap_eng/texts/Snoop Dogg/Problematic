[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Bobby J, Ricky Dillon
Snoop Dogg, oh

[Verse 1: Ricky Dillon]
Got the hustle on the gun I'm about to work it
Looking at you in my ride, yeah, you endorse it
Make some noise, this is my night, got you on the guest list
Acting up with me tonight, you'll never forget this

[Pre-Chorus: Ricky Dillon]
Get it? got it? good, I'mma, I'mma make it possible
Do it like you should, we gon', we gon' be unstoppable
Yeah it's possible, but this split shit's impossible
(Get it?) get it? (got it?) got it? (get it? got it? good)

[Chorus: Ricky Dillon]
Be the problem, call me problematic
Work it out, just like magic
(Be the problem, call me problematic
Work it out, just like magic)
Be the problem, call me problematic
Work it out, just like magic
(Be the problem, call me problematic
Work it out, just like magic)

[Verse 2: Ricky Dillon]
Got my crew mobbing deep
Go down and stay true
I'm not looking for the heat
Flashing lights are red blue
Spitting lines, flow to the beat
That next-level breakthrough
See you at my meet and greet
When I drop that debut

[Pre-Chorus: Ricky Dillon]
Get it? got it? good, I'mma, I'mma make it possible
Do it like you should, we gon', we gon' be unstoppable
Yeah it's possible, but this split shit's impossible
(Get it?) get it? (got it?) got it? (get it? got it? good)

[Chorus: Ricky Dillon]
Be the problem, call me problematic
Work it out, just like magic
(Be the problem, call me problematic
Work it out, just like magic)
Be the problem, call me problematic
Work it out, just like magic
(Be the problem, call me problematic
Work it out, just like magic)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
It's just so tragic, just like magic
Tragic, tragic, magic, problematic
One lonely kid on the block tryna be
Cool as it can be, problematic boy he is
Ain't nobody stopping cause he really don't listen
On the mission doing what he want, till he get in trouble
Now he's on the bad side, problematic slowing down
Better pay attention cause they ain't tryna play around
Lay him down

[Chorus: Ricky Dillon]
Be the problem, call me problematic
Work it out, just like magic
(Be the problem, call me problematic
Work it out, just like magic)
Be the problem, call me problematic
Work it out, just like magic
(Be the problem, call me problematic
Work it out, just like magic)

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Break bread or fake dead
So problematic, ya dig?
Oh, oh
