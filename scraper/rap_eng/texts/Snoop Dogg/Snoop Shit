[Interlude: Snoop Dogg]
Oh, uh, D.O.C.? Without D.O.C. it wouldn't be Snoop Dogg. He put a lot of inspiration in me as far as being that superstar that was wit' me before I was a superstar that made me feel like a superstar. Enablin' me to write songs with him, to take songs from him, to help him with shit that we wrote for Dre together, to accept criticism from him, to critique his shit and critique mine, and... Man, me and DOC was like Batman and Robin back then for Dre. You know what I'm sayin'? Wasn't nothin' we wouldn't do for him. We would stay up 2, 3 in the morning at D.O.C. house, he stayed like 15 minutes from Dre, drinkin' Miller Genuine Draft, playin' video games and we'd stop playin' the game. DOC would go downstairs, I'd be upstairs. He got a cassette, I got a cassette, we writin'. We meet upstairs in about a hour and half, I spit my shit. He'd, like, [Snoop impersonating D.O.C.] "That shit dope but you got to change that part, that shit ain't out"
Alright, fuck it. But we changed that shit and make that shit tight. And had my nigga Dre's shit, like... I mean, we love Dr. Dre as far as, like... we gon' write this nigga the best shit. I mean, it's just like gettin' the best chemists in the world to go put together a bomb-ass super antidote... and you know the shit gon' be right
