Aye, Aye

[Verse: 1]
Hopped out the coupe with the suicide doors
Sipping on drank 'cause I only pour fours
Smokin' on dope cause we blowin' clouds
I sold a brick and we hitting' the out stores
Patek it splash on the wrist like a dolphin
Four-Five locked in the glove compartment
Pinky rings I ran up in Icebox
She gave me top in nice socks
I got GG all over my garment
I got Givenchy all over my garment
I cashed the check and it went in my wallet
Withdrew the cash with no deposit
Drove a stolo to the traphouse
Imma go buy that other house
Smokin' moon rock, Milly rock
Coke in pyrex yeah I cook rerock
I put my legs in Ksubi jeans
Louis V belt and it's Supreme
Jonny Dang all on my teeth
Who want the smoke, who want the beef
Bust down my Apple I'm checking the time
I took your bitch and I switch her for mine
I rock Chanel, and it's all on my body
I pull up in an all black Maserati
Butterfly jacket from Yves Saint Laurent
She gave me face in a Fendi thong
Two toned Rollie It lookin' like moonlight
Two bad bitches I guess that it's two right
