Bobby
I'm in the club so damn gone
I lost my friends and i lost my phone
I'm staggering all by alone
Don't even know how I'll get home
But its OK its alright
I'm so fresh yes, I'm so fly
I swore last night id give up drinking
Such a lie what was i thinking

I see them moving, see them dancing
Yeah they're doing that
I see them grooving poppin' bottles
Like its new to them
I wanna join them but it seems
Like they're too far for me
Plus where's the bathroom man
Cause i really really got to pee

Last night, I don't remember last night
I said I'd never last night
What was i thinking?
I really need to give up drinking
I'm not gon' drink again
But who am I kiddin'
I'm about to call my friends tonight
And do it over again

Fresh out the bath room so relieved
I make my way up to the VIP
I done tripped on a step
What the heck
I take a quick look around
And i check my fresh
Then i proceed ta-to my mission
I see a bottle
And the vodka's glistening
Good Lord they look so lovely
Pardon me while i chase this bubbly

I see them moving, see them dancing
Yeah they're doing that
I see them grooving poppin' bottles
Like its new to them
I wanna join them but it seems
Like they're too far for me
Plus where's the bathroom man
Cause i really really got to pee

Snoop
Last night, I don't remember last night
I said I'd never last night
What was i thinking?
I really need to give up drinking
I'm not gon' drink again
But who am I kiddin'
I'm about to call my friends tonight
And do it over again

That's right, cash right
Shinning like a flashlight
Baby shake your ass right
Cause this could be your last night
Set the mood, smoothly groom
Ladies feel my living room
Bobby A, what you say?
Ian Carey, my DJ!
Play that song make it bang
We gon' be here all night long
If you got that feeling feeling
Yeah now sing the song
D.O. double G, I am so publicly
Speak my mind take my time
In the sky I am fly
If you're low come with me
Cause i can get you hella high
Join my crew be my friend
Tomorrow night we do it again
Same time different place
What an ass, what a face
What a life you can have
And you don't have to pack no bags
Just get on me and tomorrow night we do it again
That's how it is I always does it be
Your place or mine a case of wine
Baby stop wasting time, so take a flight
Cause I'm only in town for one more night

Bobby
Last night, I don't remember last night

What was i thinking?
I really need to give up drinking
I'm not gon' drink again
But who am I kiddin'
I'm about to call my friends tonight
And do it over again

I really shouldn't have another one
But I'm just having way too much fun
So go up another set
For you, me and your friends...
Some hatin' like im a rock star
As all these famous, like famous, like famous..
