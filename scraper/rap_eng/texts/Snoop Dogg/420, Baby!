4 20 got more weed than anybody
But it ain’t legal to export it for money
What am I gonna do? I’mma be legend, oh no
Just take a toke, early girl has giantly grown
4 20 got more weed than anybody
But it ain’t legal to export it for money
What am I gonna do? I’mma be legend, oh no
Just take a toke, early girl has giantly grown

[Verse 1]
If you ever see stressed Europeans, take them
To the land of 4 20, fuck the Amsterdam!
Don’t get me wrong, that ain’t ‘bout my hustle workin’
But with a long ding ding dong, you would also start flexin
Developed meth cooked from meds, what’s next?
Forget the AKs or Tecs, we got the semtex
But in a fact, Czech is so peacfull place to stay
Just avoid that injection at station’s railway
Afraid of giant tyrant? Boo boo, I’m an immigrant
Gimme ur cigarrette or I’mma be your minister
Hit Andrey in face to put him chains on
Let’s cut his hands off with chainsaw
Dumb bird, thinks he's an expert, sweet
But we don’t need to support import of weed
Have nothing to prove to anyone, so maybe
Just listen to Snoop Dogg, it’s "4 20 baby"

[Hook]
4 20 got more weed than anybody
But it ain’t legal to export it for money
What am I gonna do? I’mma be legend, oh no
Just take a toke, early girl has giantly grown
4 20 got more weed than anybody
But it ain’t legal to export it for money
What am I gonna do? I’mma be legend, oh no
Just take a toke, early girl has giantly grown

[Verse 2]
Euro bitches moan in 25 languages
10 currencies manages cabbage of sausages
And for ages whole Union’s got a hole
In the middle zone like we got the fucking mole
Maybe more cuz now we're outta P’s at all
I mean the Brexit, federation? Hell no
Please, everyone speaks as antiques
You fucked with Creeks, and French freaks?
Joking about le ISIS, Nazi bitches
Noone got it with missing English, tak si piču vyliž
Share it on network, let everyone in the world know
That we got much more drugs than we can ever smoke out
With drugs money would fill the exchequer, in a minute
Is that pig-headed pig-fucker on a detox? Damn it!
If we wanna make it legal, it’s already done, with no tax
Extra cash for clowns that stupid kids‘s drown on vote note? No thanks

[Hook]
4 20 got more weed than anybody
But it ain’t legal to export it for money
What am I gonna do? I’mma be legend, oh no
Just take a toke, early girl has giantly grown
4 20 got more weed than anybody
But it ain’t legal to export it for money
What am I gonna do? I’mma be legend, oh no
Just take a toke, early girl has giantly grown

[Verse 3]
Never did any promised changes, sorry
But nobody changes after teen ages, I’ve been
Changed by the first mail from a jail
Dear son, take some crystal to prison and don’t fail
Holdin’ it in a back pocket
Cops checked me and said “You can go, kid“
I felt like a rocket and then it’s late to get
Outta black market, glad that I got that
Knowledge? Hah! My brain did speed overages
College? Gave me a shit, now I'm developin’ web pages
My school was internet, so I smoked Jack in there
With no an underwear, teached by Mary Jane
About working hard as Czech Minister, please
Am I too fuckin' high, or they are part of secret police?
It’s the same as KGB, but we prefer STB
Get in that nasty ass and transfer its STD

[Hook]
4 20 got more weed than anybody
But it ain’t legal to export it for money
What am I gonna do? I’mma be legend, oh no
Just take a toke, early girl has giantly grown
4 20 got more weed than anybody
But it ain’t legal to export it for money
What am I gonna do? I’mma be legend, oh no
Just take a toke, early girl has giantly grown
