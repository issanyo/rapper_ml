[Hook 1: Eased & Snoop Dogg]
Your eyes are going blink blink and all is forgotten
(Damn)
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
(S to the N double-O P, and Seeed)
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink all is forgotten
(Dope shit on a tight beat)

Your eyes are going blink blink and all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink all is forgotten

[Verse 1: Both, Enuff, Eased]
Can't sleep at night, feeling weird
Thoughts of her fill my head
Seeing this girl would be the fix
Call her up, she's never there
Don't get an answer, I should stop
I'm too cool to feel this hot
Lace my shoes, get in the car
Ride off the lot, going real far
I'm a lone dog on the road
And I don't know where to go
The voice I hear that's inside of me says "Maybe she's home"
Blue lights behind me, oh no
Female officer on patrol
Down goes my window, we click
Oh, that ticket was gold

[Hook: Both, Eased, Ear]
Your eyes are going blink blink and all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink all is forgotten

Your eyes are going blink blink and all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink all is forgotten

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Crookin' the game, boy look at my chain
Big fish with a wish take a hook in the game
G, no dough, see mo' flows
Finding Nemo? Get yo nemo hoes
Blinged up the shine, swinging up the vine
I cock, tick-tock it's time
Overexposed shoulder it rose
To a whole 'nother series, new jewlery
Ride, yeah on my chest
I'm fly I'm fresh, so high oh yes
S to the N double-O P
Ever grown weed, never low key D.P.G.C, that's us
And we bust to the white meat
And spit dope shit on a tight beat
Doing the right thing like Spike Lee
I'm going off the motherfuckin' zone bitch I might get-

[Hook: Both, Eased, Ear]
Your eyes are going blink blink and all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink all is forgotten

Your eyes are going blink blink and all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink all is forgotten

[Bridge: Eased]
Yeah, you know how it goes ya'll
If one girl's there, another will come

[Verse 3: Eased & Enuff]
New Madame makes me gaze and stun
Have to raise my thumb, she's a loaded gun
Cool me down for my brain is gone
If no savior comes, I'm gonna burn my hand (They'll tell it!)
Some guy's wanna spy out and tellele (Yell it!)
My wife's gonna cry out and yellele (They'll smell it)
The dogs will sniff it and smell it, retell it
And the press gonna buy it and sellele (Easy)
So simmer down and please let me go (Wanna go)
Raise the dimmer for the lights are too low (Oh, oh)
In this thriller, can't leave the field as a winner
So better watch out Mr. Dellélé

[Hook: Both, Eased, Ear]
Your eyes are going blink blink and all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink all is forgotten

Your eyes are going blink blink and all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink then all is forgotten
When your eyes are going blink blink all is forgotten
