[Verse 1: Jenn Em]
A few years ago on Christmas Eve
It was a snowy white evening
I had just rolled a nice Christmas blunt
When on the rooftop I heard quite a thump
I sat up straight, what could it be?
I heard the stories but I never believed

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Until I fell right down her chimney
I sparked one up with Santa Claus
I didn't even know who he was

[Chorus: Jenn Em & Snoop Dogg]
We got so high on Christmas Eve
No one else got presents but me
You know Santa likes his Christmas trees

[Verse 2: Jenn Em & Snoop Dogg]
Kick up your feet, take a rest
He said "This Christmas stuff has got me so stressed"
I know the thing that'll do the trick
Santa baby come and take one hit

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And then two puffs and we're Christmas lit
I sparked one up with Santa Claus
She didn't even know who I was

[Chorus: Jenn Em & Snoop Dogg]
We got so high on Christmas Eve
No one else got presents but me
You know Santa likes his Christmas trees

[Bridge: Jenn Em & Snoop Dogg]
The fire is slowly dying
The reindeer are so so tired
Outside my sleigh is waiting
But Santa is way too faded
What a Christmas Eve

[Jenn Em & Snoop Dogg]
I sparked one up with Santa Claus
I sparked one up with Santa Claus
I sparked one up with Santa Claus
I sparked one up with Santa Claus
I sparked one up with Santa Claus
I sparked one up with Santa Claus

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah she did
What a Christmas Eve
I've got so many places to be and so many people to see
All these kids want their gifts
What time is it? 11:59?
I only got one minute? Oh wow
