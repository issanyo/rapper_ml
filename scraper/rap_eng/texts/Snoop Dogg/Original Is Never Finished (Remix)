[Verse 1]
One of the greatest of them all
Dogg Sinatra
In pocket with the rocket, I got ya
Awe and amazement
Flippin through my pages
I live my life lit up
Lighting up these stages
Ridiculous, outrageous, greatness, contagious
Still on top, lookin' ageless
I plan my play then scheme it out
Draped up, caked up, all day, I dream about
Protecting my position
I did it my way, no preventions, or no permissions
Listen

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Fingers I flick it, let you figure this out
Snoop Dogg and I'm back in the house
Superstar, Snoopy hard and he came with the flow
Adidas on my feet, hi top or low
No matter where I go, I get a check in a plane
When you speakin' on me, dog, put respek on my name
Worldwide with the heat life
I was brought up the street life
They love it cause I does it with them 3 stripes
The big drug beater, gotta stay cheetah, me and my 'Didas
Yeah
This important
No Jordans
No-no-n-n-no!

(Outro: Crowd of people and Snoop Dogg)
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way
It's the only way
Ya dig?
