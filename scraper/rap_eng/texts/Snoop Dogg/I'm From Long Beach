[Intro]
You know I'm tuned in with the best from the 213
This is DJ LOS
This is Long Beach moving Y'all
Get ready, get ready, get ready
Turn up

[Hook]
Nigga when we ride on them haters
Nigga when we slide, motivation
If you wanna find me, come to Long Beach
213 is where I be at

[Verse 1]
Beach city, beach city, that's my claim to fame
Reminiscing, while I'm twisting, standing in the rain
I'm in the mixing game, all my joints get fit to pain
And I gripped the cane and I gripped the grain
And I only came to spit the game
Straight up out that Long Beach to Strong Beach
Sneak baby in the party with that long heat
At the wrong beach to play with
Stay with that mossburg, that AK
That chop-chop that whoop-whoop
That's spray day, that's mayday
Now Snoop do what he want to
I will do and I won't do
Slide up, ride up, fired up when I dump two
Now all it takes is one line but thanks to it flipped out
Long Beach, east side, yes sir we cripped out

[Hook]
So Nigga when we ride on them haters
Nigga when we slide, motivation
If you wanna find me, come to Long Beach
213 is where I be, off of Long beach
213 is where I be, off of Long beach
If you wanna find me, nigga come to Long Beach

[Verse 2]
Classics, ain't giving out no passes
Get low or get gone you gonna end up getting blasted
So plastic it's drastic, but I'mma keep doing my part
I was raised up on the east side, born and bred at king park
After dark, no hooks, no marks, all G's
Dipped through the funk out and I graduated with all Cs
Sold dope and I made bread, never switch and that's real shit
Stay down from the playground and I always represent 20 crip
I'm so cool, old school when I paint pictures like Shoku
Ask anybody not just the homies, Snoop Dogg he been a fool
I really do I got heart and I got smart
Bad part, don't panic I'm on Atlantic
And yep, yep I got the Cannon

[Hook]
So nigga when we ride on them haters
Nigga when we slide, motivation
If you wanna find me, come to Long Beach
213 is where I be, bitch off of Long beach
So nigga when we ride on them haters
Nigga when we slide, motivation
If you wanna find me, come to Long Beach
213 is where I be, off of Long beach
