[Verse 1: Davion Da Great]
I'm hearing that talking, I'm hearing that talking, that talking don't matter
I walk in this bitch and I shine like a light, man, my wrist is a lantern
You niggas is hating, I'm throwing that money, you'd think it's Atlanta
I'm all on the plane like I'm talking to bitches, I'm thinking 'bout landing
Fresh in the city, I'm fresh like I'm Diddy, these bitches, they want me
It started with one but it ended with two, like it's 3 in the morning
She calling her bitches, I'm calling my niggas, I think it's a go
I'm letting you know and man, that shit perfect

[Hook: Davion Da Great]
My chain is so heavy, my Rollie got bezzles, them diamonds is perfect
My crib is so big, got a butler and maid and man, that shit is perfect
I made it, I made it, they thought that I couldn't, man, that shit was perfect
That shit was perfect, man

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Listen for this, the way that I lay down the shit that I do
Like rapping, I'm maccing, I'm trapping, I'm acting, my bitch is your boo
My money and cars and jewellery and fame, that's all with the game
Or really it's all about can you survive a drought when there's no rain
Perfect, flip that shit, now work it
Run these hoes like raining brothers, bitch, you in my circus
Let this game surface, show you what your purpose
Keep you on that right track and I help you keep your focus
Now that you know what I am and I am what I say that I am
I say what I do and I did what I did, my nigga we fan
My bitches are stars, I meet 'em at bars, we sit and we chat
I give 'em this dick, they give me they money, as simple as that

[Hook: Davion Da Great]
Perfect...

[Verse 3: Davion Da Great]
I'm making this money, I live in that mansion, my life is so groovy
I live like a star and I shop every day, man this just a movie
I start off at Louis and end up in Gucci, blow dough with your hoochie
My chicks are Asian, they love eating rice and they look like Karreuche
I drive in that Bentley, got 3 chicks that with me, I think that's a tandem
It's straight to the crib and they busting it open, no planning, no planning
I know they can't stand me, I know they can't stand me
But they know I'm winning, better lost my time and look at me cause I'm

[Hook: Davion Da Great]
Perfect...
