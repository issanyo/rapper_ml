[Fiend]
Yeah, this is the excited private better know as sleepy eyed Jones Capone
Better know to yall as Fiend
Im here with Prime Suspects, and Snoop
I wanna dedicate this to my old lady

[Fiend-Chorus]
Nah, Do you know my old lady (Quarter key, Quarter key)
Tell me what she do for me (Quarter key, Quarter key)
Helping feed my family (Quarter key, Quarter key)
All my niggas named her "D" (Quarter Key, Quarter key)
Nah, Do you know my old lady (Quarter Key, Quarter key)
Tell me what she do for me (Quarter Key, Quarter key)
Helping feed my family (Quarter Key, Quarter key)
All my niggas named her "D" (Quarter Key, Quarter key)
Can't keep her ass off the streets my old lady

[Fiend]
The one that got me pushing mercedes
The one that made all yall buster niggas shady
She made everyday in the hood in the hood just gravy
Kept me thinkin that gang a niggas named Jackers was gon play me
See my baby, would amase me, when she hit the block
Her dycker names are grams, pizza, and rye
What she got ain't no need for  another bitch
But its so hard, I dont seen brothers kill brothers quick
Mothers done lie sick, from ,meeting up with my girl
She done make my pockets fat from Curuptin world
But see dont let hr high tonight
Cause she'll make you end your life tonight

[Chorus]

[Snoop]
I have a lot of bitches
I made a lot of riches
I fucked a lot of bitches
Which is the reason
I fell in love with her
I never meant to hit her
She's the preachers daughter
And Quarter Key is what they call her
She's a Chi town baller, checking cheese from new orleans
Then she ship it down to her folks uptown in Harlem
When my chips get low, that's what my old lady for
Can you hear me dawg nigga, do you feel me dawg
All my niggas in the game feel the same way
Getting honey for the money, then cut like O.J
My lifestyle is crazy im living way to shady
Im at the pad acting bad my old lady

[Chorus]

[Uzi]
She drive me crazy can't keep her off the streets
A down bitch, down to make me rich, she hot, she makes me keep some heat
Some say I switch cause I left my boy for that girl
But they tripping, she's TRU 2 me, they tryin' blues so let that bitch run
My world she understanding never demanding
And never overweight, when I go to jail she post bail
And when Im hungry she fixes a plate she's playa hated
By these sucker, and jomie they wanted the beef
She kept my homies paid I know they like her
Because they nicknamed her "D"

[Glock]
My old lady snow jumped off the poacher
Native four expensive hoe she balls cutthroat
With gangstas cross if you here to one time
Ain't no flossing, but if you pimp the bitch and stack the grits
She make em good money they hoe hype stand on the block all day
Long police mad, can't stand my bitch game plan
Slick with her should I love money making bitch
She got that fire, got all that junk and boy 6

[New 9]
My old lady be the thug hoe
You niggas wanna love, my old lady tattoo slug bouncin
That ass in the club my old lady got the tweakers,tweakers
And she love when I beat he with that B-12, and watch it swell
Making my paper on the streets, ugh and since I
Pimp her so sweeter it comes back to me
A boss bitch, every nigga wanna please
But they better get the fuck from around me, soul survivors, up in it
Pimp that hoe for me from that LAP, to the LBC now pimp that hoe for me

*Chorus til end*
