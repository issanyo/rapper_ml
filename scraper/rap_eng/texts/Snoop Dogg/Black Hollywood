[Hook: Bobby Valentino]
It's Black Hollywood!
Where the stars are bright
We all get money, everything's alright
It's Black Hollywood!
Where we party all night
Big city, bring dreams, doing big things
Ain't no place like, Hollywood!
We gettin' money
It's Black Hollywood!
Every night's a party
It's Black Hollywood!
If you don't believe me
Come and take a ride with me

[Verse 1:  Mistah F.A.B.]
It's for the bosses and ballers
My pallers and homies
It's V.I.P.'s and invites only
Hollywood, Hollywood, Black Hollywood
We ain't trippin' on nothing boy, it's all good
I'm only in town for the night
It's the party of your life, red carpet, strobe lights
You ain't here
You a square
Short tail dress, she should holler at a player
Shoes on, have a drink with me, put your hands up
This for grown folks; Pull your pants up!
You see the models and actors?
The fixtures and factors?
The singers and rappers, they looking classy and dapper
I look good! Smell good at the same time
Valet bring my car, "Oh no that ain't mine!"
Mine is the masi with the red guts
Pull up playing 2Pac, baby keep your head up

[Hook:]
It's Black Hollywood!
Where the stars are bright
We all get money, everything's alright
It's Black Hollywood!
Where we party all night
Big city, bring dreams, doing big things
In your face like, Hollywood!
We gettin' money
It's Black Hollywood!
Every night's a party
It's Black Hollywood!
If you don't believe me
Come and take a ride with me

[Verse 2: Too Short]
I got a car full, we in the 4-door
Police trippin', but I don't ever go slow
On my way out, on my way in
Smokin' weed and im speedin' in a grey Benz
And we smoke big - in the club too
Everywhere we go, we burn a bud or two
I see the ball players and the R & B singers
To make it here, you know you gotta be your tremendous
Yeah they be happy when they see me
Your whole life's on reality TV
And everything's free, what it do, G?
You a big time producer making movies?
Behind the scenes, I get the picture
You hanging out with movie stars and directors
Just seen Snoopy Dog and Mistah F.A.B
Bobby V, tell'em where we at!

[Hook]
It's Black Hollywood!
Where the stars are bright
We all get money, everything's alright
It's Black Hollywood!
Where we party all night
Big city, bring dreams, doing big things
Ain't no place like, Hollywood!
We gettin' money
It's Black Hollywood!
Every night's a party
It's Black Hollywood!
If you don't believe me
Come and take a ride with me

[Verse 3: Snoop Dog]
Take a picture, you can frame one
I'mma hit you with the game gun
Denzel, Will Smith, and Halle Berry
Add Snoop Dog, that's legendary
Big cars, nice homes
Weed and rolls, designer clothes
Blue carpet, that's how it's laid out
You see my life is a movie
So gone and play it out
I can teach you, greet you, will seat
Do what I tell you and I will put in my sequel
We can walk down Sunset Boulevard
Walk the sidewalks and hang with the stars
Liar, liar, pants on fire
I want my star to be next to Richard Pryor's (Yeah)
Because I'm the people's champ, and
Black Hollywood, that's where I'm at
