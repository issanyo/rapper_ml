[Jermaine Dupri:]
Uhh, whatchu wanna do? SoSoDef
You wanna get down? (ah get down, get down)
Whatchu wanna do? (ah get down, get down)
Said you wanna get down? (We got Snoop Dogg, in the house tonight)
Whatchu wanna do? (with the homeboy JD)
You wanna get down? (ah get down, get down)
Whatchu wanna do? (ahh ha ha)
Yeah, now check this out

Now, everywhere I go
They wanna see Don Ciccio
Yes obsessed with SoSo all my dough
How the jewelry glow and the Cristi' flow
Ain't no secret I sleep with freaky
Premium bush when I push they push
And after we push I leave her
Cause I don't love her

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Ha ha, and me neither
A-B-C-D-P-G-C
Who could it be, it's the D-O-double-G
Known for the bone and the chrome on the D's
Gold credit card backyard full of green trees (what?)
Breeze through the summer in a Hummer with tint
Or dip in the low-low but that's just for promo
Never leave me alone, without the dough doe
I'm so so cold but y'all didn't know doe

[Chorus:]
[JD]
Whatchu wanna do? Said you wanna get down?
Whatchu wanna do? Said you wanna get down?
[Chorus: Trey Lorenz]
Get down on it, get down on it, get down on it
We just wanna party with you
[Snoop]
We have Snoop Dogg in the house tonight with the homeboy Ah get down, since you wanna get down

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
To be a high roller, you need a pistola
And about a half a key of some Coca-Cola
Now that I got older, I got a little colder
And I don't trip to get a chip off my [nigga's] shoulder
Mad dreams, of a gangsta being like Cagney
Or Bogey but Snoop Doggy
Ain't no follower, man I'mma general
So when I put it down I gots to be so original
I'm quick to bust just like Daz Dillinger
But that's the little homey
And I'm the big homey Snoop Don Corleone
Spittin it, hittin it, while I'm gettin that
Bout it, bout it, and happy to shout out, mmm
I dissapear 'fore the game get crowded
Take a trip overseas to the West Indies, freeze
JD (uh-huh), music please

[Jermaine Dupri]
I get goosebumps when the bassline thumps
So phat [niggas] call me Professor Klump
Ain't nuttin on the low about me I floss
And no there's none of these [hoes] son what I toss
On the track better bring chips cause I cost
Million dollar company [fuck it] I'm the boss
I don't sit back and watch, I go for it
Different colored drops on the car port, who's short?

[Chorus]

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Khakis on my leg, Lugz on my feet
I'm walkin up the street while boppin my feet
I'm fresh off the bus from Memphis, Tennessee
Head still spinnin from the Coke and Hennessey
Sit down on it, nah, get down on it
It really don't matter cause you want it, Dogg-gonit
Cuzz, you must was buzzed
When you was bumping your gums, who you thought I was?
But look, I ain't even tripping right now
It's like that there, bow, wow
So many styles I could flip em like a file
Pop my drop top and let the beat rock
Dip through, course you do, miss you
But back to the issue, I wish you
Stop tryin to clown the Pid-ound
Cause you don't really wanna get down

[Chorus]

[Trey Lorenz]
All we wanna do is make you dance
No standing on the wall, baby
[JD] Get your back up off the wall, c'mon
All we wanna do is make you dance
No standing on the wall
[JD] Get your back up off the wall
Cause I heard all my [niggas] say
You know it
[JD] Uh-huh
When you're dancing yeah
[JD] That's right
You show it
[JD] Uh-huh
When you move move move
[JD] Yeah
You know it
[JD] Do you wanna dance? Come with me and dance
When you're dancing yeah
You show it
[JD] Do you wanna move? I'mma make you move
When you move move move
[JD] Come with me, yeah yeah, we gon let the beat go on like this
Y'all wanna dance? I'mma make your dance
Y'all wanna move? I'mma make you move
