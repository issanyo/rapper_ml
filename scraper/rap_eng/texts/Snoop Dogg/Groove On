Stop, take a minute look at my watch

Some are little blue some are red, some are white
From a far you would think I was a cop
As soon as I step in the club
Everybody showing me love

Hands in the air, let's celebrate

Sexy ladys [?] get your groove on
Pour a little more in my cup
Before I go and tell the DJ turn this up
In the club havin' fun no one giving a fuck
Standin' up on the furniture living it up
You know me so fresh and clean
New kicks, new chicks when I step on the scene
New whips so sick, came from overseas
But so did me, ha-ha

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Come on and get your groove on
Come on and get your groove on
Put your hands up high and
Move your body, get your groove on

Move it, groove, so get your groove on

[Outro: Big Ali]
We go party all night

Everybody in the world

We go party all night
Until they break the [?]
Everybody in the world
Time to get your groove on
