[Chorus:]
Somebody gon red cross
Bullets take yo head off
Cuz we strapped better lay it off [x2]
Laying in the dirt, you'll be better off [x4]

[Verse 1:]
Laying in the dirt, laying in the dirt
Nigga caught a mean on for playing with the word
I pump from the PM to the AM on the first
Nigga violate then he ain't staying on this earth
Got the block jump'n er'body hustle
All hit the club at night, er'body bussing
Standing on couch, er'body gusting
Yo bitch in our section, er'body fucking
I just want the paper, 40 with the laser
Looking like i pulled the Cyclops out the blazer
Bla bla, hit a nigga with a head shot
Bla bla, we be gone before his legs drop
Hit him and be ghosts, no mercy for the broke
I'm banging with some gunners, I'm banging with some lopes
I gotta couple bloods at that beach [?]
He thinking its a joke until he end up in the scope
Let it go

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Own it like I want it, don't go in it the house is [?]
6 feet in the dirt with only flowers on it
His momma standing by and denying the fact he gone
Gonna got his head flown, ended up dead wrong
Quick draw my [?], get shit popping off
See rag on my face, load the choppers Mook
Don't shoot, I'm the spook who sat by the front door
With the chrome, desert eagle, 44
Let me begin by say I'm a gladiator
If you don't get that [?] on the planet for later
And shot him with that [?]
Young wildebeest got eaten by a alligator
I'm a lion in the jungle with these Hyena
Pigs in branches sending me subpoenas
Ditching this nigga, put a clip in this nigga
My superman business see the bitch in the nigga
I knock yo motherfucking head off

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Laying in the dirt you'll be better off
Play Russian roulette with all my enemies and I never lost
I'm [?] like what you bring that 30 for
I got the street sweeper for each one a yo dirty floors
This big shit, skip the backup
I break a car apart, I call it the reaper snapper
You making song bout how you gon hit me after
Opened up, inside is sweet... candy wrapper
Still got the money in a mattress
I'm telly Riley, turn his head to a classic
I done supply the funeral homes with so many caskets
I should probably pay taxes, dumb niggas with masses
I strike and make it hot
Niggas never learned not to play with matches
Put a bounty on yo head cuz I napkin
Take yo hat off like Rex when he rapping
Easy

[Chorus]
