Murder block to the swamp front of grandmama house
They don't sleep, well freak off brand knock em out
Stay deep, bring heat make streets emorge
Young Gs, Lil Gs, casualties of war
So we push the turf steady pushin work
Niggas love seein thugs so we look for dirt
Where the shit don't stop and them six fours hop
If ya just get socked, don't trip gettin dropped

[Goldie Loc]
All black wit a little bit of gold
Now lemme show you motherfuckers how the eastside roll
Footin to the metal, every hand on stiletto
Extra clip for you booyah, pinche Longeros

We got straps in this bitch I got somethin on fat
Tellin you motherfuckers, "Damn!"
It ain't no thang when you bang wit the Dogg Pound (DOGG POUND)

From the LB city, where them shells leave many
Wannabes on they knees, tryna beef wit a gizze

Better hope you on my side once I clutch and draw
My reactions, attractions, fast and all actions
Till I die east the side, I stay smashin
Represent this like its meant to see
To the graveyard or the penetentary
