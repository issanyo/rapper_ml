[Intro]
For those of you that don't have anything to believe in
This song right here's for you
I'm here to tell you the power of somebody I know personally
Listen to me

[Chorus]
There is power
Glory, faith and strength
In Jesus

[Verse 1]
If you enjoyed waking up with that food on your table, say amen
If you enjoyed putting money in your pocket, say amen
If you know God is able to cure anything, say amen
If you know that he's able and willing to cure you, say amen

[Chorus]
There is power
Glory, faith and strength
In Jesus

[Verse 2]
Don't you enjoy waking up in the morning, period
Say yeah
And I know you gotta love when you're sick, and the doctor say it ain't serious, say yeah
It could be worse, you could be hurt, living in the streets, under a bridge
Don't shoot the messenger, just tell it like it is

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry y'all, I'm just telling it like it is
I'm just speaking my mind on behalf of the Lord
And I wanna let you know, you need to get on your knees and pray and thank Him for everything, no matter what situation

[Chorus]
There is power
Glory, faith and strength
In Jesus
