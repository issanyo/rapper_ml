[Verse 1]
Oh, it can't be right...
"How come?" meets the end...
Before you leave me, say a word...
And it's a waste of time
I know that I change
The way your heart picks the ones you love

[Hook]
What's the difference when you say all the words?
You'll still be with her, and I'll be fighting for more
What's the difference when you explain she's the one?
No, I don't think straight - 'cause I'm a woman who's madly in love

[Verse 2]
You should say goodbye
But baby, it wouldn't even matter
...the way I'm losing love
They say it'll pass...
But lately I don't even bother to leave the light on...

[Hook x2]
