Verse 1 (Snoop Dogg):

Break the bank take the girls
Travel all around the world
This is life nah, this is love (Oshe)
Have a drink now live it up
Break it down roll it up
Pass it round take a buzz
Feeling grand mil in hand
Check the game I’m still the man
Ask D’banj and Don Jazzy Iceman gat me looking so flashy
Maybe they have the audacity sitting in my capacity
I said who said a lot of whooo maybe cos I am old school
Drop it down low set the mood
Without the stylist I am Mr. Endowed

Verse 2 (D'Banj):
File oshe Snoop D-O-double G
Let them know, let them know who I be
Girl if you want to floss, then roll with the boss
You know how to borrow
Ronaldo lomor, omo lati le
Tori the boy endowed o
You can never find another guy that’s fly like me
I got so much class like say I own a school
You no fit play me omo I no be fool
Let me upgrade you girl come roll with me
I’ll make your life brand new
I'mma show you a world that you never knew
Make you marvel at everything that I do
If you fumble na your loss be that
Because…

But I leave am for God
Cos at the end of the day when my people see me

If them still dey yan (yan)
Make them go do somersault on top stage
