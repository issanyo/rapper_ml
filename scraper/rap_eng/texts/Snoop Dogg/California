Baby you could be a movie star, hey (in Los Angeles)
Get yourself a medical card, yea (in Los Angeles)
Cause that's how California rolls
They do the fingers like red fox (in Los Angeles)
You can make it on a light blue box, yea (in Los Angeles)
Cause that's how California rolls
Say when I pass you that weed and I ask if
You can roll, you say bro don't you know I'm from round here
Well girl I like the way you roll
Even though you from the ghetto you belong in a home in the mountains
Not talkin' bout the view
I'm talkin' 'bout me and you
So if you wanna go to Melrose
Let's hit Adidas girl we got our own shell toes
And then we'll go to Venice
You roll so good you might as well let me hit it
For like 15 minutes
Girl, you never gon' forget it
And if you wanna go around town
I could show you where all the real hit it
And if you wanna go downtown
You might as well roll with a real nigga
I'm not talkin' 'bout them fools
I'm talkin' 'bout me and you
Baby you could be a movie star, hey (in Los Angeles)
Get yourself a medical card, yea (in Los Angeles)
Cause that's how California rolls
They do the fingers like red fox (in Los Angeles)
You can make it on a light blue box, yea (in Los Angeles)
Cause that's how California rolls
And when I hand you that weed and I ask if you can roll
You say no let me show you around here
Cowgirl wanna roll with a winner
Rodeo with a winner, Rodeo loungin'
Ain't got nothin' to lose
I'm talkin' 'bout me and you
And girl I got a home in that valley
In a rose in that valley
Just tell 'em what my name is
You heard about me, you heard all about me
Mean you heard all the hittas that I'm with gangbangin'
But I ain't talkin' 'bout the news
You know that I'm talkin' 'bout you
Let me show you all around
I could show you where all the real hit it
And if you wanna go downtown
You might as well roll with a real nigga
I'm not talkin' bout them folk
I'm talkin' 'bout me and you
Baby you could be a movie star, hey (in Los Angeles)
Get yourself a medical card, yea (in Los Angeles)
Cause that's how California rolls
They do the fingers like red fox (in Los Angeles)
You can make it on a light blue box, yea (in Los Angeles)
