[Chorus]
G is for the gang of money I make
F is for the gang of fools I break
U is for the undisputed champ
N is cause you never gonna get the mic back
K is for the niggas that I knock on they back
Damn is feels good to see Long Beach on the map
'Til the day I'm dead I'm gonna keep that shit real
Now you niggas know G-Funk's for real

[Verse 1]
To those people who don't believe in G-funk
Tried to take my style and make a quick buck
Here's a message to one and all
Your pass is revoked
Now I'm havin' a ball
Any questions come and see me
The king of G-Funk the one and only
Congratulations you sound like Nate
You took my old hook
And got me paid

[Chorus]
G is for the gang of money I make
F is for the gang of fools I break
U is for the undisputed champ
N is cause you never gonna get the mic back
K is for the niggas that I knock on they back
Damn is feels good to see Long Beach on the map
'Til the day I'm dead I'm gonna keep that shit real
Now you niggas know G-Funk's for real

[Verse 2]
Some people are nothin' but clones
Some people have styles of their own
Some people are copycats
These people can't get the mic back
Can you feel me one-hitter quitters?
You can't copy me, I'm one in a million
Call any expert and you can ask him
Copy machines can't copy platinum

[Chorus]
G is for the gang of money I make
F is for the gang of fools I break
U is for the undisputed champ
N is cause you never gonna get the mic back
K is for the niggas that I knock on they back
Damn is feels good to see Long Beach on the map
'Til the day I'm dead I'm gonna keep that shit real
Now you niggas know G-Funk's for real

[Bridge]
When you feel like some cavy G-Funk
You need some music to bump in your trunk
I got a baseline, a gangsta tune
Put on the classics and your head will be movin' soon

[Chorus]
G is for the gang of money I make
F is for the gang of fools I break
U is for the undisputed champ
N is cause you never gonna get the mic back
K is for the niggas that I knock on they back
Damn is feels good to see Long Beach on the map
'Til the day I'm dead I'm gonna keep that shit real
Now you niggas know G-Funk's for real
