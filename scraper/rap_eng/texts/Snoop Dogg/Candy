Narcotic this window meth merchant
Shippin' and handlin' your life supply
Time to get up and wipe the eye boogers out my eye
What y'all tryna buy pimpin', why'know it's kinda dry
Yeah, I only gotta couple of pies left
That'll last me through the year

Doula, ice cream candy
Man, that shit be comin' in handy
It's real walkie talkie
I got that from the DB's, my cousin, work dirty

If you want 'em, I got 'em, you up to cop it
You better be about your grit
Devour any cowards, sours slippery at the lip
Beast up, suck up to none, don't be no sucker
Be a block monster, be a reputable motherfucka

Real mash with my Spanish
If ain't about no gouda, partner, you can vanish
Don't get put up in your place
Give me 40 feet and an ounce of space

Candy so sweet, got everybody eatin' it

Bigg Snoop Dogg, I'm the star of this
So go on and get yourself a bar of this
No change, man, gimme the bucks
The kinda candy I sell, they call it 'Deez Nutz'

I'm almond with the caramel insides
You appear frontin' with the French fries
How it feel, man? What it look like?
I'm in your neighborhood, pullin' on some Bud Light

Sweet and sticky, take it out the wrapper
Now put it in your mouth
To the beat of the drum, it'll be fun
And I bet you can't just eat one, candy

I'm in the hood with the six-trey candy paint
Lil' somethin' to chunk, make the *** all faint
If you know when to beep, jump my baby rate
When I grip round her butt, I hold her steady

Yeah, she my one and only
Quick to keep back haters who don't know me
I feel good about candy
My gangstas understand me

Shake it, baby, don't break it baby
Now can you make it clap?
Tryna fit this work in your gap
Drop it like it water pagoda, get my hustle on
I get it from you, then I step on it to bubble on

It's gettin' sweeter than a sugar cane
Here come that sugar daddy, black, rollin' on gold thangs
Fo'shigiddy, he turned it into somethin', boy
'Cause I can't leave this filthy game without my Almond Joy

It's like candy, candy

Get it how you want it
Whip it, twist it, pop your whip up on the corner
While I tadaa check out this bizarre
The D A T, the N I double G, the D A Z

Again, it's up in the wind, feel the breeze for s***
Goddamn, you already know who I am
Chrome on chrome, blue on blue, frost colors switches
Hit the gas, hit the brake, y'all really burn rubber?

Dip, drop, drop, dip
Stop, dip, ghost ride the whip
Yeah, *** shot caller
It's America's number one baller

Man, I don't give a *** like, "*** it"
High riders, slide in the bucket

Three thousand **** pieces, you understand me?
I wish a *** would come in this ***
If I see Suge right now, I'd tell him, "Hey, how you doin', Suge?"
I didn't even know you were standin' there, *** my bad
