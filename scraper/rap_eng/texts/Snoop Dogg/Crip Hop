[Intro: Snoop dogg]
Aye Whoo Kid, this shit right here is straight 1980-something, you know what I'm sayin'
Aye Half Dead, I got my nigga Half Dead up in there
Aye Half, remember that old school shit we used to do
Kick some of that like '84 shit for these niggas

[Bridge (2x)]
Crip Hop, we break it up
We drop it on a table then we rake it up
We put it in the paper then twist it up
And put a lighter on that bitch and get fucked up

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Bigg Dogg is back, and you know we got a hell of a sack
I said Bigg Dogg is back and you know we got a hell of a sack
I said Bigg Dogg is back in the Snoop Deville Cadillac
I said Bigg Dogg is back

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Well it was just one day that I'll never forget
I mean I tried to stop smoking but I just couldn't quit
I called up the diggy-doc on the telephone
But it seems that the doctor was not home
To my surprise, I had to open my eyes
I'm trying to visualize Snoop Dogg without being high
It's like a hell of a picture
I used to never think weed was something I'd get addict to
Aye baby girl you know I wanna stick it to ya
If it's cool with you, then light it up boo
"Well I don't really smoke that stuff, I mean smoke that much
Okay I guess I'll get fucked up"
So everything went according to plan
So I went up in this bitch up off of weed and hemp
She told me that she liked it, I told her that I did too
I said: you know DJ Whoo Kid? well bitch suck his dick too
And turn the TV on MTV2
So I can watch the Osbournes cause that's what I wanna do
Hell yeah I smoke weed right in front of you
And tell you whatcha gonna do, bitch that's whatchu gonna do
Bitch I'm Snoop Foxy, dropping game on yo' ass, pimpology
Come follow me, and smoke with me
The bitches here nigga straight VIP


[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
The Bigg Dogg is back, and you know we got a hell of a sack
The Bigg Dogg is back and you know we got a hell of a sack
The Bigg Dogg is back in the Snoop Deville Cadillac
The Bigg Dogg is back
