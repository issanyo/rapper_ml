[Hook]
I got my nine in my pocket and I'm ready to bust
And if it came down to it I wouldn't (give a fuck)
About these bitch-ass niggas, I just don't (give a fuck)
About these trick-ass hoes, I just don't (give a fuck)
I got my nine in my pocket and I'm ready to bust
And if it came down to it I wouldn't (give a fuck)
About these bitch-ass niggas, I just don't (give a fuck)
About these trick-ass hoes, I just don't (give a fuck)
About y'all

[Verse 1: Snoop]
Yeah, who smokin'? who drankin'? who fuckin'?
Cause, it really ain't about nothin'
Push the button if ya down with the PG
My nigga Fly did this beat, this shit is greasy
He holla'd at me about turnin' this mutha out
Met a nigga in Chi-town at the Bishop house
No doubt, Midwest Side, with the nutty East Side
Had no other choice but to make it rizz-zide
Now I gotta slizz-zide, bizz-ack up in traffic
I got the boombastic, hit you off with a classic
Terrifically, police doggs be sniffin' me
That's probably why I catch a private jet like frequently
This is ineek-quity, nah it's inequity
That's when you put your money down on some property
And get ya chips right, and move like monopoly
And do this shit properly, ain't none of y'all stoppin' me

[Verse 2: Guerilla Black]
Uh-huh, yuh
Caucasians say I'm so amazin'
But all the niggas be like "that ain't Nathan"
Hell, you dealin' with a monster
Talk shit, I'll hunt ya
Like a predator, I kill all competitors
Nothin' does a body more better than ten shots
Break his bones with the bat, wrap him in glad lock
Find a stash spot where the smell don't seep through
Or alibi the titty bar, the girls well see through
Come near, see how I drop chips on the Buccaneers
I know you hate us, heart broke up like the Raiders
Up in San Diego, I got the ticket high
Cause I got to fly way up in Waco
Peruvian yayo, freshly imported
Take a tool, burn ya nose off like [?] nigga

About these trick-ass hoes, I just don't (give a fuck)
