[Featuring Snoop Dogg]

[Snoop Dogg]

I falls off into a party in the N.Y.C

Niggas lookin at me strange but they lovin my chain

Bang bang same thang game came when I left em

I do it by my lonely now I'm the Big Homie

[Slick Rick]

But I'm his Royal Slickness ghetto weakness come Rick is

The one who expose cornball rappers with the quickness

Uhh who bum from and who balls you hung from

Wouldn't give a fuck what part of the country you come from

[Snoop Dogg]

I'm Snoop Dogg, I'm smooth and imperial

I wake up every morning to my Lucky Charms cereal

Times get drastic, yeah I'm a classic

Dogg Pound Gangsta chokin off that Boombastic

[Slick Rick]

Now put my verse on the first one-beat the herds come

So be careful cause my rap will make you eat your words son

(Word to God) Scratch I? Who the hardest to match (I)

Bright rewrite your still Garbage to Patch

[Snoop Dogg]

Haven't you heard? I'm loose, shook the Feds like The Juice

Snoop Dogg is a hundred-and-twenty-first proof

Fool usea deuce-deuce of some Genuine, Draft

I'm genuine, like Vinny's whinin all about cash

Cash, cash, so indeed I got the weed

And keep the lighter for the hash, has it

Ever been a time when you didn't have a dime

And the only way to get it was to go and do a crime?

Chorus: Slick Rick (repeat 2X)
Many underclothes hangin on the hoes

Since (Snoop, Slick Rick) crushed anyone opposed

Lot of ladies - pop Cristal, toast to all those

Like (Kid Capri) helpin to Unify both coasts

[Slick Rick]

I'm shredding your temple, none, 'head of the emperor

Washed up, gang member? Better remember

I wipe my feet upon a rapper like a doormat

I hit em -- where they sit around actin hardcore at

Thank God for the guardians - in light of this

Rappers always beg for me to show them who The Mighty is

Gats gonna limp, snaps on a kid

That always want to start rappin (boy they're not gonna win)

And want to dash at lethal or evil

Could a King bring style and class to black people?

Stick a whole log in and he buggin

Cause I - represent self, with my man Snoop Dogg and them

I drop a pile of semen on em

Even in a Yugo I could take they woman from em

I make the hardest chew the kewl of this

Kid Capri, know the part of peasant, who The Ruler is?

Chorus

[Snoop Dogg]

I'm twenty-six.. still in the mix

My hair gettin longer, my game gettin stronger

A nigga been on one, I thank God

Cause life in the city of stars is gettin hard

And it's odd, for a G to get a job

So I'd rather steal and rob, and mob with my squad

My homie used to bang, now we follow Farrakhan

Used to read The Source

Now all he read is the Holy Qu'ran

Time brings change and change brings time

Listen to me hit you with this gangbang rhyme

Nigga, whattup, who up, YOU up!

Doggy Dogg is on the mic

I'm here to fuck it izzzup

I give it to y'all, like you really got to have it

Dogg Pound Gangstaz, boy this shit is gettin tragic

But I'ma make me a grip and dip quick

And fuck with my nigga Kid Capri on this G shit

Dial tail and bail with my nigga Slick Rick-why

And all you niggas talkin bullshit can just miss me

Can't twist me, you fuckin paper haters

I'm dippin in my nine-eight gold Navigator

I'm dippin like a lo-lo

Bouncin, smokin ounces, fo' sho' doe

Chorus 1.5X
