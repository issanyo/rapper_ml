(Robin Thicke)
I'm in the mood for lovin'
We'll be touchin, We'll be huggin
I'm in the mood for lovin'
We'll get into..

(Chorus)
It's in the morning I wanna touch
It's in the morning I wanna love you
It's in the morning no interruptions
It's in the morning, Sex in the morning
It's in the morning I wanna touch
It's in the morning I wanna love you
It's in the morning no interruptions
Sex in the morning, Sex in the morning
You know I love it first thing
Cuz you just let it marinate, let it marinate
I'll wait for you to open your eyes
Look at me and smile
You know what I want do
You slowly pull down the sheets to reveal what you keeping wide
I can't push sleeping anymore and you got the hottest body
I got the hottest hottie
Let me put some cream in your coffee

(Chorus)
It's in the morning I wanna touch (Yeaa)
It's in the morning I wanna love you (I wanna love you)
It's in the morning no interruptions
It's in the morning, Sex in the morning
It's in the morning I wanna touch (I wanna touch you)
It's in the morning I wanna love you (I wanna love you)
It's in the morning no interruptions (Ooo)
Sex in the morning, Sex in the morning (Sex in the morning)
(Snoop Dogg)
Spin this, bubble like a chemist
Baby said she been a menace, like Dennis
So I'm up in this, rack-et like a tennis
Don't interrupt me baby boo cuz I ain't finished
Real spendin, feel how I'm gettin' it
You girlfriends is jealous cuz Boss Dogg ain't hittin' it
Early in the morning makin breakfast in the kit-nen
After ya finished you bout to get the din-nen
(Robin)
I'm in the mood for lovin we'll get into

Tremendous, splendid

Done that, been there

Your sex in the morning, it feels so good
Your sex in the morning, it feels so good
And I'm so horny for your body girl
Wrap your legs around my back
Get it get it yup yup, you got it girl

(Chorus)
It's in the morning I wanna touch
It's in the morning I wanna love you( I wanna touch you)
It's in the morning no interruptions

It's in the morning I wanna touch (I wanna touch you)
It's in the morning I wanna love you (I wanna love you)
It's in the morning no interruptions (Ooo)
Sex in the morning, Sex in the morning (Sex in the morning)
