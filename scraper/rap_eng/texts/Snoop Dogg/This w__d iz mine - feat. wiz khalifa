I wake up lonely in the morning and it feels so good
Smokin' on some shit that you wish you could
Jealousy, envy, please don't feel bad
This weed iz mine, get your own bag
A sack full of OG under lock and key
None for the homies, this is all for me
I got a blunt lookin' like a jelly palm tree
Police roll by, I got nothin' on me
'Cause the smoke's already in the air
I'm loped up with two braids in my hair
All star with the khaki suit
I'mma fuck around and take it back to classy suite
On the East Side standin' on the DIP
Back then my only weed was E-Y-E
You so PYT and you're lookin' so fine
I'm sorry, baby-girl, but tonight
This weed iz mine
This weed iz mine
You can't have it
This weed iz mine
This weed iz mine
You can't have it
This weed iz mine
Get back to the episode, sacks full of honey
Out of this world, [Incomprehensible]
This is church music, listen to the choir
To burn my kush, you must use fire
D-O double G like never heard before
Smokin' that bomb like TAC-4
West Coast worldwide, sea shore to sea shore
When's the last time you seen the G in the G4
(What?)
Don't worry, I'll wait
Time's tickin', I'm trippin', I'm slippin', I'll wait
Into the zone where these whores on my dog bone
A dog whistle and they download my ring tone
And she's so hypnotized by this pimp's poem
What I got here is mine, go and get your own
I put beats to rhymes, get peace of mind
OZ's to dimes and this weed iz mine
This weed iz mine
This weed iz mine
You can't have it
This weed iz mine
This weed iz mine
You can't have it
This weed iz mine
I hear niggers talkin' 'bout what they rollin' up
Smell what I smoke 'fore the bag open up
Good chance if you see me down smokin' one
License to get a fundamental load of shit
Real nigga, blow a reefer, I is old enough
If I'm in a building, it's hard not to notice it
Hit a really sad dog, I got some whores to fuck
I'mma fall through with the ounce [Incomprehensible] shit
Don't trip, bitch, we go all set, load a whole zip
Let you hit mine, plus you supplyin' your own little bit
My nigga get high and let the whores twist
Say you don't fuck with [Incomprehensible] how you rolled it
They ain't smokin' like us
I'm rollin' up haters, they be burnin' for hours
And if it's found
I'm smokin' the whole thing inside
This weed iz mine
This weed iz mine
You can't have it
This weed iz mine
This weed iz mine
You can't have it
This weed iz mine
I got a roll for you, do you wanna smoke with me?
I wanna smoke with you, do you wanna smoke with me?
(I wanna smoke with you)
I got a roll for you, do you wanna smoke with me?
(I got a roll for you, if you wanna smoke)
I wanna smoke with you, do you, do you
(Oh yeah, do you?)
Do you wanna smoke with me?
(I said I wanna smoke with you)
Do you wanna smoke with me?
(I wanna smoke with you)
This weed iz mine
This weed
