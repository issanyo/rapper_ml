[Intro:]
You are in my head and brains
Baby, you my everything
You are in my system
(Yo, late night groove
DÃ¥m Funk, Daz Dilli on the board, Big Snoop Dogg
Trail)

[Hook:]
System, system, system
System, system
In my system, system
In my system, system

You are in my head and brains
Baby, you my everything
You are in my system
I can't get you out my head
I just want you in bed
You are in my system

System, system, system
System, system
(You are) in my system, system
In my system, system (you are)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I don't know, what [?]
But I can see, so clearly
We have fun, [?]
Hit & run, let's now have fun
Tell me why, you real high
From the truth, about me and you
You sold me out, I don't know why
I treat you good, honey I wish you would
Keep on [?], those foul things
But I don't know, whatever I did in hell
So come with this real gangsta' shit
So baby now, get ready get on the flo' (cause)

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
You got me addicted
It only took one time for me and you to kick it
So terrific and enjoyable the night was
Put this on your tongue and catch a nice buzz
Call me a sec [?] kick that, start that up
Give me a heart attack, cardiac arrest
Put my hands on my head
Show me the [?] girl, I show you the bed
Book my information and release me on the O.R
Cause you are in my system, overdose with that
Pumpin' in my veins this is how we get
Never [?] obnoxious, so damn arrogant
Take it to the face until girl you ain't hearing it
Irresistible, tell me what you're missing o'
[?], really a vision though
Drunk, love and D.U.I
Same thing goes when you being high
Twelve stepping, oh shit I need some help
I wanna smoke a one or three cup
The bitch so selfish

[Break:]
So do you wanna go with me and get fucked up
And you be doing what we post to be
Cause you are in my system

[Hook:]
