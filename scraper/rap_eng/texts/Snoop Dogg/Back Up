[Produced By Scoop DeVille]

[Verse 1]
High speed chase, 405 is the freeway
Swangin' my bangin' my swangin' my Coupe
DeVille Scoop! DeVille, like that, right back
Top of the hill, wheel in my hand with a trunk full of contraband
Swimmin' under water like I'm Aquaman
I used to drink gin, now it's vodka, man
Boss Dawg is the baller, no propagand'
Pop yo band, don't try and stop the plan
Rocky land, step back and pop yo man
Spaced out, caked out, no bug a boo
Flipped out, Cripped out, nigga, what it really do?
Time brings change, so I changed my name
Tryna take flight while they clippin' my wings
Groupie ass niggas see ya tripping the game
With nothing to gain, plop plop, pop and I bang

Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-Hop-per, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
Ain't tryna act up, don't wanna act up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (aye back up)
Aye, baby back up, aye baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (back up)
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up

[Verse 2]
Thirty days later I'm back on the streets
Got a batch of bomb beach shit I'm trying to eat
Feet, to the pavement; money, I'm cravin' it
What about the bitches Dogg? Are you savin' them?
Can a blind man see? (No)
Can a shark survive outta water for a week? (No)
A snitch is a snitch if he solemnly speak
I don't know near nothin', I'm a product of the beach
To each, his own, hard as stone
Lotta ya'll niggas bout as hard as foam
Dead Wrong, tryin' to (?)
Step back nephew, or feel the heat of the chrome
G (?) and the heat of my (Comb?)
Plate fulla shit nigga, I never eat it alone
Heat it alone, then I put the weed in the bong
Step back at the feet of my throne mothafucka

[Verse 3]
Cinematic, right back at it
Talk the walk and walk bout that static
I am the extra dramatic
When he popped back, everybody scattered, didn't matter
I was there from the get go
Movin' heavy weights, Klitschko
Rookies and Cookies from 'Frisco
Put em' in a box, Nabisco
We the funk that killed Disco
Showed you how to go and get dis tho
And I'm the reason why your fuckin' with dis ho
But don't thank me, that's how the shit go
It's still banging Crip tho, from the intro
Nigga what they in fo?
Hol' up, who is that tryin' to come through
Step back and get mic checked; 1, 2
