[Intro: Sleepy Brown]
OutKast, Snoop Dogg, Sleepy Brown, OW!

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Ching-a-Ling, the ride is on clean, 'cause
Ching-a-Ling, we're so fresh, so clean
Ching-a-Ling, we always make a scene, 'cause we're
Ching-a-Ling, so fresh, so clean
Ching-a-Ling, I been doing things now
Ching-a-Ling, so fresh, so clean
Ching-a-Ling, the light stays green now
Ching-a-Ling, so fresh, so clean

[Verse 1: Sleepy Brown]
Here I am, you know it's me
The funk style brotha with the pinky ring
People stare, women scream
'Cause they ain't ever seen a brotha be so clean
Gangsta hats, minks to match
Glass half full just sippin 'yak
Big Snoop Dogg 'bout to...
Me and OutKast just leanin' back in the...
Cadillac, rims intact
Got the blue gators and belts to match

[Verse 2: Andre 3000 + (Sleepy Brown)]
Some people play crazy, some people play like they sane
It doesn't matter, we always play in the rain [Play in the rain]
Too much of data can make the mind overload
Scramble all logic, not even you can decode
Where are we going? Can we slip and we slide?
It doesn't matter just shut the fuck up and ride
I am, a multi-pimp, so fresh, so clean
Primp, primp, primp, in a...

Got the blue gators and belts to match)

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Ching-a-Ling, the ride is on clean, 'cause
Ching-a-Ling, we're so fresh, so clean
Ching-a-Ling, we always make a scene, 'cause we're
Ching-a-Ling, so fresh, so clean
Ching-a-Ling, I been doing things now
Ching-a-Ling, so fresh, so clean
Ching-a-Ling, the light stays green now
Ching-a-Ling, so fresh, so clean

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg + (Sleepy Brown)]
I woke up early on my birthday, pimpin' in the worst way
Never come in last place, usually come in first place
First they chase me, lace me, and taste me
Keep me some Brandy, Cagney and Lace it
Face me, look at me, now tell me what you lookin' at
A P-I-M-P in wingtip Stacey's
Lately, hate me, it's all that they could trip on with
And know them niggas' bitch to hit
That I'm the one she kick it with
Run and hide, tell a lie, watch the P-I-stizi
O-U-T-Kizni, Dirty Siouth-sizni
The bitches love the way we ride
So if you ain't a big dogg, then I suggest you stay insiznide
I be, G S-N-double-O-P, E-S, LBC, you feel me?
You can't sell me, tell me, silly, gilly, hilly billy...
...while I slide in the 6-9...

[Verse 4: Big Boi + (Sleepy Brown)]
To the window to the wall, to the bathroom, bitch, don't fall
The 'Kast gone keep on humpin' and dumpin', and post up on all of y'all
Got my nigga Snoop Dogg, LBC, College Park, E-P-T
On the remix tip, we gon' sit and rim tip and wingtip
Like a boss pimp, not a lost pimp 'cause I...
(So fresh, so clean) Wearin' hard shoes, or none at all, I...
(Limp walk with lean)
Take Godzilla and the gator from Lake Placid
Manufacturing in a fashion, mashin', mobbin', stabbin'
You crabbin', your girl is sappin' and frampin'
I'm snappin' and trappin', dapper, debonair, dashin'
All I need is some Cognac, and a cold, cold cola, slashin'
Smooth, serious, smashin', multi-rubles matching
Toot that booty, I'mma toot the horn
I'm a player, every time they ask me in my...
(Cadillac, rims intact
Got the blue gators and belts to match)
Two times (Cadillac, rims intact
Got the blue gators and belts to match)
