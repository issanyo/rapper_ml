Walking on air

[Bella Blue & Lance Bass]
Like a shot through my heart, such a fool boy
How you spin me 'round
Show me all the stars in your world boy, circling around
But I can't let go 'cause I want you so
Baby I'ma hold you tight
If you just say so, I'll be falling in your arms tonight
Higher, wanna fly (fly)
Wanna fly (higher)
Higher, wanna fly (fly)
Wanna fly

Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying
Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying

Walking on air

[Ian Thomas]
Only you, you know, you know how to make it right
(How to make it right)
When you came in and taught me what love is all about
(What love is all about)
Got to be your level
Make the world freeze
Baby we can do it better
Take a pic stop
I got it, you got it, we got this
I know you want it tonight
Flowing around, we got the day
We take down the lights
Promise you to keep it real and show you what is right
Higher, wanna fly (fly)
Wanna fly (higher)
Tonight we're going high
Higher, wanna fly (fly)
Wanna fly
Higher

[Bella Blue & Lance Bass]
Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying
Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying

Tonight we're going high

[Snoop Dogg]
Mind to mind, eye to eye
Talking, walking in the sky
Yea, yea what a player
Cloud 9 in the air
Elevator, celebrator
This feels good to me
Love is speed, speed to seed
Heart to heart, you and me
What's it gonna be
What you want me to
I just got to find some time and space to be with you
Taste the aroma, all on own
G is the word, free is the earth
Sleeping down, sleep in town
Blasting off from the cloud

[Bella Blue & Lance Bass]
Feels like I'm walking on air
(I'm walking on air)
Feels like I'm flying
(Feels like I'm flying)
Feels like I'm walking on air
(I'm walking on air)
Feels like I'm flying
(Flying)
