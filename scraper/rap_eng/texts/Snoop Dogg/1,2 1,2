[Verse 1: Raekwon]
If I ain't rockin' emeralds and Bentleys, I'm coolin' in Poughkeepsie Me, shorty, new Glock 40, and some bent weed
Ridin' the married boots, take care of me, sincerely
I'm Israeli, machettes is cris, swish some Baileys
Snuggled up, mink on, call it a cover up
Just like two murders in the hood, I'mma double up
The rap surgeon fix the game up, crack merchant
Everything I sell is well, my shit is that worthy
GATs that come up out the ceiling with the beam on it
Chinese Queen, Parasuco jeans on her
Rock long jeans, known for throwing blings on her
I stay king, by any means scream on it nigga

[Interlude]
Come on, let's go nigga
Word up, close the door to the Aston nigga
Yo, get out the, take that shit out the ash tray man

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Do you remember a real gang member?
Choppin' til he timber, December to December
Never stoppin', too busy poppin' off lead in the heat
Clownin' ass all around him, they crown him the Dogg Father
Glock hot, crock pot on the block with a chef
Out of bounds on the grounds with a hole in your chest
Invest in back in feedback, gorilla the west
Take a whiff of me, spliff, till it fill up my chest
Convertible with the Cadillac, mackin' the mack
With some Roscoe's Chicken in my lap, imagine that
I'm groovin' down Sunset Boulevard
No harm, no foul, no body guard

[Interlude 2]
Yo, stop right there man
You don't know what you're doin' man
Chill, chill, let them handle that man for real

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Chill yo, the movie is scary
Take off the sheep skin shotty
Nigga make a move, and don't dare me
I'm blessed with these million dollar hands, I'm like poker
Niggas screw they motherfuckin' face, so what?
Guns are collected, flips perfected
Boats flying in, every brake's inspected
The clique's connected, everybody wrist and neck lit
Two shots of Cisco, let's slip
Post like Scarface and Sosa with my memosa
All that motion, see my billiongs posted and roastin'
See my villains most of them roastin'
Freshmen chickens get close in 'em
Make one move, she buyin' me the Ghost in it

[Interlude 3]
Pass the dutchie
You know what it do man
We in Wonderland huh

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Stealth but get loud like a space shuttle
Catch a case, a motherfuckers got a place for you
And it's 100 brothers like you that's cold with the Typhoo
Slang and things and buck 50 with the jinzu
Draw that line, flip that dime, spit that nine
Homie this Crip on mine
Thought you knew
We cold crushin' bum rush the chef, it's my nephew
The king of the west too, niggas to test you
Let your next move be your best move
Ja bless you
1,2 1,2 what you gone do when we come through?
1,2 1,2
