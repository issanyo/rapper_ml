Late night on the move, what you bitches wanna do?
We can do a hotel or get up in a swimming pool
Set up on the mountaintop, let you get a hella view
Once you get the diznick, you do what I tell it to
Ain't no telling like Jack told Helen
You can kick it with a he-she or chill out with a felon
I'm a go-gorilla not your average bitch nigga
All I want is your money but I just might hit up

[Verse 1]
[?] money gone
Got your bitch on my cellphone
Tryna get with a nigga but I'm 'bout gone
Gone like a motherfucker, really not trippin' man
I'm fuckin' with these hoes and I'm getting all these bitches man (bitches man)
With the game of the players and and I'm only [?]
Big fame with the game, man I'm certified
Won't say, Ros√© went to her defense
Don't say nothing nigga that's my bitch
Hoes say late night when it fall apart
They say and I took her from you in the dark
Inner freeze and I end up with the car keys
Had to put the bomb weed, as I break a bomb bitch
And they say you roam in the centerfold
But she bomb and she grown and she wanna go
So I put her in the back of a Sprinter Van
Rent-A-Center [?] van, yeah I went up in her man

See here's the thing right here baby, now when you with a mac you gotta get maced and when you with a pimp you gotta get pimped but when you with a player you gon' get played. So which one is it? Cause it's late night, choose up. Slide up outta them store shoes and slip into these hoe shoes. Yeah, like Pimpin' Silky say, see about it. Haha yeah, it's late night, it's real late, it's too late to be talking. I mean it's too late for anything but uh...doing what we came here to do, so let's get it
