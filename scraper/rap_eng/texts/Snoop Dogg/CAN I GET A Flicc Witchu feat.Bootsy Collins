Say that I dissed her 'cause I wouldn't kiss her
But I got her a picture said, "I'll holla back witcha"
Hey, they say that I'm like Mr. Bigsta
All these bullshit moves that missed us
Divide in twisters we buy relistas
We mind my listnats 'cause I'm a mista
Design by mimstas these time are senistas
But I'ma finished her on the ground until it's done
Knives and silly clubs hoes and fake thugs
Pimps, players and all of the above

Pigs won't pinch us, won't just miss us
And they wanna French kiss us
Pack the pistas, twist don't twist us
Roll with me on this dog adventure
But you can't enter without your credentias
And if you get in, you might get a picture
So sit your shit down, go on and get down
