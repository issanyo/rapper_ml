[Intro]
Party people, your dreams are now being fulfilled
Fuck this fake shit, it’s time to get real

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
It’s a party up in here and if you don’t know
And if you didn’t come to the party then you gotta go
Hands up in the sky, wave them around from side to side
Got you feeling, how you feeling, how you feeling? Dynamite
Hands up in the sky, wave them around from side to side
Got you feeling, how you feeling, how you feeling? Dynamite

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
What the ladies say? Hey
Ladies, what the ladies say? Hey
Ladies, what the ladies say? Hey
“Yeah, dawg, we got your back”
Where, my homies at?

Gangstas, where the gangstas at?
“Yeah, dawg, we got your back”
We own it like we want it, yeah
We be it ‘til we beat it, yeah
And only you can give it to us cause you know we need it, yeah
Let the music play, I’m gon’ say what I’m gon’ say
Stack that stack, back the blue ‘lac up, Afrojack that’s my DJ
So, we gon’ continue to do what we do
All around the world, for real my nig, we be fucking up

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
It’s a party up in here and if you don’t know
And if you didn’t come to the party then you gotta go
Hands up in the sky, wave them around from side to side
Got you feeling, how you feeling, how you feeling? Dynamite
Hands up in the sky, wave them around from side to side
Got you feeling, how you feeling, how you feeling? Dynamite

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
On some other shit and all them bitches lovin’ it
I’m loving it in covenant, I never give ‘em my [?]
But I’m shoving it in public with my lowkey approach
You wanna be on my team? Bitch I’m the coach
Let’s go, straight to the locker room, get dressed and hit the grass
Cake and making that cash, break and shakin’ that ass
For a players, for your layers, say I promise you, designer shoe
I’mma do a [?] to find time, spend a little time with you

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
(Yeah, man (ha, ha) Yeah man)
Drinks in the air, smokin’ on a fat blunt
Turn down for what, nigga we turnt up (x3)

[Instrumental break: 16 measures]

Drinks in the air, smokin’ on a fat blunt
Turn down for what, nigga we turnt up (x3)
