You're trippin on your girl cause she showed me love
Nigga dont beat her, cause if you beat em, ya dont need em

But you know I ain't tryin to floss but
Murder was the murder was the case that they lost

In and out of the Boz Hotel, they say your family dont know me
Hold on homie, thats phony, informal
Say, tell, L's in jail, vest before test
No one in my click fell (what)
The females with the almighty fatherly
Cuz we thinkin bout peeps, what they need
