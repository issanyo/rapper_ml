[Intro: Snoop]
Yeah, what's up babygirl?
I got a little question I want to ask
You know what I'm sayin'
I want to know if you can, uh- if you can get away
Cause you lookin' like you wanna come play
You know what I'm talkin' about
I got my nephew Ray J in the house
I got my nephew Goldie Loc in the building
And this is produced by David Banner
And we wanna talk to you a little something like this babygirl
Dig this

[Hook: Ray J & Snoop]
I've been watchin' your body since you walked in the party, girl I wanna get naughty
Can you get away?
Takin' shots of patron and takin' shots to they dome I know you wanna go home
Can you get away?
I peeped out your persona and it's makin' wanna take ya to California
Can you get away?
I flirt ya down for the evenin' we can go to the beach and we can jet on some skis and
Can you get away?

[Verse 1: Goldie Loc]
Lil mama you killin' me, what's the reason for feelin' me?
Call me on your lunch break, moan and groan, it's bout to be
We on some kinky stuff when I get home to break you off
I can be your guidance whenever [?] get lost
Sendin' me flicks on that sidekick, stressin' out
You had a bad day at work, I know what it's all about
I'm in the studio wishin' that I was there for ya
Ain't nothin' but air between us I'm just gon' come and getcha
You make me feel bad when you frown up
Make me wanna turn off the beat and hang the mic up
Jump in my fast car and drive like a NASCAR
I hope I don't get pulled over, I drunk up the whole bar
I'm so scared that if I lose you it might hurt
Cause the letters on your thong spell out the word "flirt"
So quit ya job, we don't need the money anyway
I look good in the bed when you leave about 8

[Hook: Ray J & Snoop]
I've been watchin' your body since you walked in the party, girl I wanna get naughty
Can you get away?
Takin' shots of patron and takin' shots to they dome, I know you wanna go home
Can you get away?
I peeped out your persona and it's makin' wanna take ya to California
Can you get away?
I flirt ya down for the evenin' we can go to the beach and we can jet on some skis and
Can you get away?

[Bridge: Ray J]
Oh-oh-oh-oh yeah
You're so sexy
Oh-oh-oh-oh yeah
So sexy
Oh-oh-oh-oh yeah
So sexy

[Verse 2: Goldie Loc]
Can I hit that? I don't mean to be blunt
I got that bottle of patron with that doggy dogg skunk
I'm only in town for a show and then I'm back home
Can't wait for you to back it up and slide me some of that bomb dome
I'm lookin' for a classy hoe
As I slide my gators on walk through the Bellagio
Me and my niggas pass it back and forth like ping pong
And don't be scared when I pull out this donkey kong
Ooo-wee, thick with them Serena legs
And got pretty lips, like Eva Mendes
A boss need a boss lady, heard dat?
Hello world, I promise I'ma kill that
Left leg down, right leg on the shoulder
That baby fat feel good to a soldier
They don't call me the Loc for nothin'
Just give a gangsta a call when you want me to hurt som' for real

[Hook: Ray J & Snoop]
I've been watchin' your body since you walked in the party, girl I wanna get naughty
Can you get away?
Takin' shots of patron and takin' shots to they dome, I know you wanna go home

[Bridge: Ray J]
Oh-oh-oh-oh yeah
You're so sexy
Oh-oh-oh-oh yeah
So sexy
Oh-oh-oh-oh yeah
So sexy
