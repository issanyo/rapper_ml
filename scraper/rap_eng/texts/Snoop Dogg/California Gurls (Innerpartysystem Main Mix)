[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that, all that, ass
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that, all that, ass

[Chorus: Katy Perry & (Snoop Dogg)]
California girls
(California)
California girls
(West coast)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg & Katy Perry]
Toned, tan, fit and ready
Turn it up cause it's getting heavy
Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns
The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the king and a queenie
(all that, all that, all that, all that, all that, all that, ass
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that, all that, ass
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that, all that, ass
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that, all that) ass hanging out

[Verse 2: Katy Perry & (Snoop Dogg)]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
(All that, all that, all that, all that, all that, all that, ass
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that, all that, ass
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that, all that, ass
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that, all that) ass hanging out
All that ass
(All that, all that, all that, all that, all that, all that) ass hanging out

[Chorus: Katy Perry & (Snoop Dogg)]
California girls, we're undeniable
California girls, we're unforgettable
California girls, we're undeniable
California girls, we're unforgettable
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
All that ass hanging out
(Ass, ass, ass)
(All that ass hanging out)
All that ass hanging out
(all that, all that, all that, all that, all that, all that, ass)
(all that, all that, all that, all that, all that, all that, ass)
(all that, all that, all that, all that, all that, all that, ass)
(all that, all that, all that, all that, all that) all that ass hanging out

[Outro: Snoop & (Katy Perry)]
California gurls man
I really wish you all could be California girls, girls, girls...
(All that ass hanging out)
(All that) ass, ass, ass...
(All that) ass, ass, ass...
(All that) ass, ass, ass...
(All that) ass, ass, ass...
Hanging out
