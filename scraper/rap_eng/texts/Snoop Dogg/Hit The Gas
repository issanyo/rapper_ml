[Verse 1: Raven Felix]
Uh, you fuckin' with a fly bitch
Fly shit, too fly to be a side-bitch
In front of me, I'm like, "Bye, bitch!"
Your boyfriend ridin' in the whip, ‘cause I drive stick
Uh, stuntin' is a habit
Haul ass, while I'm dippin' through the traffic
With my bitches blowin' smoke, getting ratchet
Pump up my first shit, it's already a classic
In my Benzo, speedin' up the tempo
Runnin' through Cali from the Valley to Modesto
You fuckin' with the best though, Raven the queen
And if a dude actin' up he don't make the team
It's like that, I'm the one they can't wait to see
But I don't quit the role out, I got some place to be
I whip it fast, dudes just wanna get the ass
But they gonna have to keep up, and hope they don't crash

[Hook]
Hit the gas, hit the gas
We drive fast and we going to get the cash
Hit the gas, hit the gas
Uh uh, hit the gas
We drive fast and we going to get the cash
Hit the gas, hit the gas, hit the gas
We drive fast and we going to get the cash
Hit the gas

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Vroom, vroom, give me some room, room
I'm 'bout to roll through with a bag of boom, boom
It's never too soon, so what it's high noon?
See, if I twisted your Mrs., I'm a tycoon
I mean I'm too goon, I mean I'm too gone
When I hit the gas, soundin' like an H-bomb
It's S, N, double O, P – bitch, you better know
She said: "Pop the clutch!", so I let it go
All you see is smoke, all I do is smoke
Burn the blunt, burn the rubber, and now we all choke
Tryin' to be discreet, don't try to run at me
Should have checked my 9-1-1 LB pedigree
Ain't no catching up, you gotta let it be
And if you trying to [?]
Raven, where you at? You in the Valley?
Ain't misbehaving, Big Snoop and Raven

[Hook]
Hit the gas, hit the gas
We drive fast and we going to get the cash
Hit the gas, hit the gas
Uh uh, hit the gas
We drive fast and we going to get the cash
Hit the gas, hit the gas, hit the gas
We drive fast and we going to get the cash
Hit the gas

[Verse 3: Nef the Pharaoh]
Neffy blow jetfuel
I make her wear a hardhat, ‘cause I'm a real tool
I was the man in school and out of school
You think I'm going back to work, then you a damn fool
Watch me hit the gas on that ass
No chips on my pass on that ass
Kick back, roll a blunt and crack a left
‘Cause my life's lovely and your niggas mad
He ain't got enough fun [?]
I re up on that gas and I fill up on that gas
I'm all screwed up, like Philip's on that ass
You got an ass on an ass, I got a dick in my pants
If you do a little dance, I'ma throw a couple of bands
[?] I make her put it in my hand
Bend that ass over, baby, three-point stance
P made her say "Uhh," I'ma make her say "Heh"
When I put that big pump in her tank, hit the gas

[Hook]
Hit the gas, hit the gas
We drive fast and we going to get the cash
Hit the gas, hit the gas
Uh uh, hit the gas
We drive fast and we going to get the cash
Hit the gas, hit the gas, hit the gas
We drive fast and we going to get the cash
Hit the gas
