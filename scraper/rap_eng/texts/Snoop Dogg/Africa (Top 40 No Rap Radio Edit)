[Intro]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Verse 1]
And as I'm walking through the subway
All I feel is everybody's piercing eyes (piercing eyes)
I'm following the footsteps all I can imagine is that I'm a guy
You never know maybe she's afraid
And everything around her is so damn fake
I feel like that we've met before
Hurry boy she's waiting

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I blessed the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Verse 2]
The sun is rising on east side and every former life is waking us
The feeling of seclusion makes you wanna dream away of falling in love
She drags you in, not afraid
Everything feels like bait
What's wrong with you, don't let her go
Hurry boy, it's waiting

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I blessed the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Bridge]
Doobara, doobara, doobra, doobara, doobara
Doobara, doobara, doobaba, boorr, boobaba
Dodo, dood, adooro, orooda, dooroo, dobara
Doobara doobara doobara baabaabaa
Hurry boy it's waiting there for you

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I blessed the rains down in Africa
I blessed the rains down in Africa
I blessed the rains down in Africa
I blessed the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
