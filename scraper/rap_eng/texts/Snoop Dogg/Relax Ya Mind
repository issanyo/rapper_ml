Relax your mind
Relax your mind
Relax your mind
Trust me, I’ll entertain ya
By watching stars, making love all night

[Verse 1]
Ooh, baby, I’m not giving up tonight
(Not tonight, not tonight)
I want your love
Ooh, I’m stressed, need you to comfort me tonight
(Oooh)
‛Cause only you can make it right
Oh, I hope I’m gonna feel you here all night
(Oooh)
I wanna feel your touch

[Pre-Chorus]
Every part of me keeps watching
Maybe you will come and stay today
There’s nothing better in this world
Than baby when you say

Relax your mind
‛Cause all I want is you
Relax your mind
Tonight I’ll come to you
Relax your mind
No stress, it’s me and you
Trust me, I’ll entertain ya
By watching stars, making love all night

They just make me fall in love with you
Your tenderness is warming up my heart and soul
That’s why I’ll never let you go
Ooh, I hope you gonna stay with me tonight
I wanna feel your touch
