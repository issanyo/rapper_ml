[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, yeah
It's another one of those
Snoop D-O-Double G, L.T. Hutton thangs
Yeah, we all off in the hills right about now
It's about two in the morning! (Say what, say what)
Ya know
Eastside, eastside
Keepin' it way real
Dogg Dogg
LB City

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
If you got beef With D.P.G
Holla at me The D-O-G
If you got beef With D.P.G
Holla at me The D-O-G

[Verse 1: Jayo Felony]
If I lead
The average rapper would have broke down a long time ago
Try to bang in a show and get slumped like The Crow
Anyday now, we gon' run it, my homies is killers and they fowl
We see it all like night owls and we stay on the prowl
They don't wanna see me shine again, they messin' with my mind again
But as soon as I finish this Heineken, I gotta go get my nine again
It got a body on it from a party, don't it?
Yeah, and I been tryin' to slang it, but don't nobody want it
They can't help you with band-aids, we comin' with grenades
You ain't seen this many [{*niggas*}] in your life with diamonds and braids
I'm from the home where they get sprayed and gang related raids
Y'all fools that start bangin'
After Colors was made
Let's C-walk to that
And never give me no hassle
Cause I come from one of the worst cottage in Paso

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
If you got beef
With L-O-C
Then holla at me
The D-O-G
If you got beef
With D.P.G
Holla at me
The D-O-G

[Verse 2: Tray Deee]
It ain't no mystery, you dissin' me, you dissin' my clique
And ain't no question we come steppin' straight to get in your mix
So why you actin' like a trick
Puttin' your business on wax
When we could scrap or slap a clip
If you wanted to crack
See, in the pen, we got a name for busters runnin' they yap
Sale soldiers, roll 'em up with somethin' up in they back
Handles ours, battle scars, shackles, guards and all
And we the last soldiers standin' once they start to fall
Now make the call
Or bump it, just kick off the brawl
Cause I'm ridin' with my dogs, win, lose or draw
Dogg Pound, insane, neighborhood twenty gangin' it
And every gangsta that I hang with
Down to bang
Full time, pull mines, and I gots to bust
What's a pass, when I mash, anybody get touched
So make my name taste just like a fist in your mouth
So watch the way you on my jock when you spittin' it out
Dogghouse

[Pre-Chorus: Uncle Charlie Wilson]
Any problems, any problems, you can holler at my dog
Holler at my dog
You can holler at my dog
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Repeat Chorus & Pre-Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Goldie Loc]
When will you haters ever learn
That time is money
And money is something a brother never had
That's why I appreciate it, but look
What I got goin'
Keep bangin' on you suckers, still ride, still flowin' with
The heat
I put it to ya back and bust
I'm known to break 'em off with the rhymes I thrust
I push it down all the time, everyday I do
Continue to journey on the mission with my dogs in blue
Fool

[Snoop Dogg]
Now, don't come 'round here trippin' with us
Cause on the real homeboy, we be givin' it up
And to you chickens who be thinking y'all could slide by
With that punk trip, trick
Biddity bye bye
I chin-check suckers and girls, it's all the same
Dogghouse, no doubt, man
We runnin' thangs
We got
Friends and foes
G's and gold
Rules and codes, s'you can ride or get rode on

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus & Pre-Chorus
