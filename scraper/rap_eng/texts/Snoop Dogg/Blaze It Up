[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Life is just like a baseball game, three strikes you're out, no doubt
Curveballs, knuckles, sliders, and heaters
You gotsta stay on your toes and keep your eyes on their dick beaters
They greet us, like they down with our leaders
But they knowin' damn well they wanna defeat us and cheat us
Hmm, weed is-
Kick back, relax, and blaze like saks back to back
Every corner that I turn and every city I'm in
Every time I set my mind to spit rhyme with my pen
I mix the gin with Hen
Penitentiary and the graveyard got my homeboys but I refuse to let 'em back me in
I come out bustin' and blastin' in a Dogg Pound fashion
Nigga, that's what's happenin'
In this game I'm on my own with my back on the wall
Right hand on my heater, left hand on my balls

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
I'm screamin' "fuck the laws"
Dogg bones and paws
Drinkin' cans of 8 balls with the muthafuckin' straw
Tilted, leanin'
Hoes tryna get at a nigga, security screen 'em
We dem G's, just C's, no fleas
We beez the epitome of rap, D-O-double-G's
The biggest, the realest niggas speak on it
You got a hunnid on it? I got a bad freak on it

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Spent about a week on it
Season, marinate, tryna get it tight
Now I got that shit tight
Let me spit it tonight
Bust a bad bitch on sight
Skeet on her face and then I gotta catch a flight
At 8:30 in the mornin' wit' my nigga Dwight
Who got a show for a nigga?
Who got some dope for a nigga?
Since everything on cuz I guess he got a hoe for a nigga
Love it or leave it, I'll take her home and beat it
I love it when a bitch act conceited
That's when I tell her I don't need it
See I can pass it
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin' classic
Bitch don't ya know?
I put the G in the P and put the C in the rolls
But you know, 'nuff said
Pass the 40 of the oh-ee
I'm takin' it to the head

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Fuck the laws
Dogg bones and paws
Drinkin' cans of 8 balls with my muthafuckin' straws
Tilted, leanin'
Hoes tryna get at a nigga, security screen 'em
We dem G's, just C's, no fleas
We beez the epitome of rap, D-O-double-G's
The biggest, the realest niggas speak on it
You got a thousand on it? nigga I got a freak on it

[Spoken: Snoop Dogg]
