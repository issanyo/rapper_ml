[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You better check yo self before you wreck yo self
Cause I'm bad for ya health, I come real stealth
Droppin' bombs on ya moms, kill car alarms
Do a foul crime, I'm the brother with the alpine
So down for our sets though, always let tricks know
And friends know, we got the indo
Yo, I'm not a sucka, sittin' in the house of pain
And no I'm not the butler, I'll cut ya
Headbutt ya, just so you can't touch this
And I wouldn't touch ya punk, youse a sucka
Here to let you know boy, oh boy

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Tricks wanna step to Snoop and then they get played (why?)
Cause they trick-made, pullin' out a switchblade
That's kinda trife hoe, cause that's a knife hoe, AK-47 assault rifle
Hold the 50, I'm nifty, how? got a new style
I hate when suckas be claimin' that they foldin' bank
But steady talkin' mess in the holdin' tank
First you wanna step to me, and now yo' ass screamin' for the deputy
They send you to Charlie Baker [?]
And now they runnin' up in ya slow
Dear God, used to be Don Juan, and now your name is just 'twan
Switchin' it, snappin' it, rollin' yo' eyes in it
You better run a check

[Chorus 2: Hustle Boyz]
So chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrizzy-wreck yo self
So chickity-check yo self before you wrickity-wreck yo self
Big D's in ya mouth, it's bad for ya health

[Bridge 2: Snoop Dogg + Hustle Boyz]

Mmm...yeah, BC powder, yeah
See my priority is to keep it real West Coast right about now
Matter of fact, my priority is the West Coast...yeah

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
If you're foul, you better run a make on that license plate
You could've had a V8, instead of a trey 8 slug to yo' cranium
I got 6, and I'm aiming 'em
Will I bust or will I keep you guessing?
F-U-N that noise you stressing
Trick, get off the wood, you no good, there goes the neighborhood
Rat, go ahead and keep ya draws
Givin' up the claps and who needs applause?
At a time like this, pop ya coochie and ya did
The girl is a Mi-ami Hurr-icane head
Sprung, homies call her lips and lungs
Nappy dug out, you should get out
Cause women like you gets no respect
Trick, you better run a check

[Chorus: Hustle Boyz]
So chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self
Chizzy-check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity-wreck yo self
Cause tricks like you is bad for my health

[Bridge 3: Hustle Boyz]
Yeah, chick-check
Yeah, puff the grass

[Chorus: Hustle Boyz]
So come on and chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self
Chizzy-check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity-wreck yo self
So chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self
Chizzy-check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity-wreck yo self
