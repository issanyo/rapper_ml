[Intro] penis sucker

[Verse 1: Bad Azz]
Indeed I am nigga
Flossy like gangsta shit
I got pounds of weed and keys sittin' on G's Catch a breeze
When I ride by high sittin' on 'Tonas
Tearin' up spots And blocks in my hood ain't got no corners
Cause we done chipped 'em all off a proper piece
Bustin' rocks and Glocks And gettin', ghost from the Police
No peace So, he gets served with no concern
To who gets burned
And one day they'll learn
Not to be fuckin' with the nigga buckin' with the trigga
Nothin' you could figga could help you escape
From this mind state
That I create young nigga
Yeah! and it's just like that

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]

Boom, boom, boom... boom
L.B.C. out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom... boom
My rearview mirror's vibratin' cause my speakers go

[Verse 2: Soopafly]
Now I rock
Some will talk
It don't stop
When that funk shit drops To make your shit go pop
Now let that beat ride In your 'G ride
We gettin' me right Hittin' with that Dogg Pound "C" life
Now it's I, with that stylish flow
So niggas step back or heads get cracked, and I won't let back
Who comin' with that gangsta shit
The shit that only gangsta's get gangsta with
Now quick to bust your ass like the cop
Waitin', debatin' for my ass to flip flop
But I don't flop
I just flip the script When I did and set trip
Keep the clip close to my hip
And don't say shit
When I blast
I done told your ass
Slow the fuck on down
Dogg Pound, Motherfucker

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Boom, and you know that

D.P.G's out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom... boom
My rearview mirror's vibratin' and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom... boom

[Verse 3: Techniec]
From the archives
I arise off the Long Beach streets
Will be comlete to the do is done to all that competes
Don't be alarmed as I swarm through
I warned you and your crew see wax
So, what's that?
A known fact
Battle that the habitat our men is deadly
You can get diluted or depends on where your head be
Strivin' for what your in for
And for your info mo' flow
Than the tightest nigga flowed in '94
So, stand and deliver
Watch nigga's shiver
Quiver in they boots
As I mob with my troops
Through the east where the phonies get deleted
Be seated, and all the G's I know stay heated

[Verse 4: Tray Deee]
See I was born to be known as a thug and thief
So anyone with beef I gotta slug to sleep, peep
I'm not no nigga Figga' he can come up
By gettin' a job so I mob, not givin' a fuck
I'm the drama Mama warned all they kids about
I mash up strapped get my dibs n' out
Hustler musn't trustin' a gat
To keep me fat
Seekin' victims pick 'em and then I stick them in track
My heat black
With the cereal number scratched out
Don't wear a glass shield but you'll still be assed out
I'm Mr. Tray Deeee
And since they say "G"
As my title
My method mainly homicidal

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Boom, Yeah, and you know that

Boom, boom, boom... boom
My rearview mirror vibratin' cause my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom... boom
Boom, Yeah, and you know that
2-1 out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom... boom
My rearview mirror vibratin' cause my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom... boom

[Verse 5: 2Pac]
Could it be, my history livin' G like
Enemies that wanna see me, would it be like
Picture me practicin' perfection now hit the deck
Playa haters gettin' chin checked when I hit the set
Watch how they fall When I buck 'em all
We Outlaw, Westside Playa, touch 'em all
I buck 'em all then remain ballin'
Out the moon with my Glock cocked shot callin'
Brothers fall then they crawl and they beg for they life
Should've never tried to rush me, you're dead here tonight
It's Thug Life
Go tell them bustas up at Bad Boy records
Fat tricks got a big mouth, must've better check it
I can see it plain as day, this game I play wide open
I pull the trigga dead figga with his eyes open
His pride brokin', I tried smokin', but bailed out
Soon as they left me at the jail house
Mobbin' in my...

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, and you know that
Death Row out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom... boom
Outlaw out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom... boom
My rearview mirrors vibratin' and my speakers go
D.P.G. out the moon baby baby
