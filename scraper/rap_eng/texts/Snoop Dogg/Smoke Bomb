[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, it's that sick shit mane
I had to do it
I got the do it fluid
Laid back understand me
Doing what I does cuz
You know who it is
It's the Big Snoopy D-O-double-Gizzle
Fo shizzle baby

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
So fast, so quick, so hard, so slick
Take a walk in my shoes but them feet don't fit
No shit, pulpit, shift switch on a bitch
Rolling up a fat one stacking my chips
Now check this, sip this, have a seat and recline
Hot spit, dog shit will blow your mind
I'm not braggin', but I'm C flaggin'
64 hot and I keep shit poppin'

[Pre-Hook: Snoop Dogg]
What y'all come here for?
Oh we came here to dance
But we will pop pop in advance
What that mean?
That mean, that we don't give a fuck nigga

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
We don't give a fuck nigga
All I wanna do is smoke and have a good time
All I wanna do is have a good time
All I wanna do is smoke and have a good time
We don't give a fuck
West Coast motherfucker
We don't give a fuck nigga

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Hands up, now twist your fingers
On the set momma raised a banger
Every hood do the same stuff
And then they came up when they name up
With a bunch of hard heads like
Biggie Poppa, Warren G, and Lil' Half Dead
Rectified, don't run up on a nigga or your neck will fly
Back in your lap click-clack get back (back-back)

[Pre-Hook: Snoop Dogg]
What y'all come here for?
Oh we came here to dance
But we will pop pop in advance
What that mean?
That mean, that we don't give a fuck nigga

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
We don't give a fuck nigga
All I wanna do is smoke and have a good time
All I wanna do is have a good time
All I wanna do is smoke and have a good time
We don't give a fuck
West Coast motherfucker
We don't give a fuck nigga

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, you hear that sick shit?
I had to do it
It's the S to the N double O P
You know the rest
West Coast motherfucker
