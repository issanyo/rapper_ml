[Intro]
Yeah...what's happenin' cuh.  Let you know a lil something bout me.  I'm Junior boy Fleetwood...from a lil city called Long Beach.  You may have heard of it.  Yeah

[Hook]
'Round here, we Crip or die...all day, we Crip or die...when you young, you Crip or die...that's the first thing you learn on the Eastside
'Round here, we Crip or die...mamas and daddies, they Crip or die...that's all we know, is to Crip or die...so watch how you move on the Eastside
(Watch how you move when you on the Eastside, when you on the Eastside, when you on the Eastside...Watch how you move when you on the Eastside, when you on the Eastside, when you on the Eastside)

[Verse 1]
Lock n load rock n roll sock em up n watch em fold
20 homies 2 minutes gangbang overload
Wanna be a gangsta well this the first step
Choose who you wanna cruise with, that's your birth set
Now get you some heat and learn to merk back
No rats and cat naps where you work at, for real
My family, they chose the shield
But me, I'm a Dub with the Pittsburgh Steel
Slang drugs with them thugs that'll split your grill
Hard life late night man this shit so real
LBC and C is bout as big as it can possible be, on me, we
E-A-S-T-S-I-D-E, C-R-I-to the P, I is he
Gangstas, ridas and we get busy
And swang them thangs like we slanging a frisbee
Pop a few shots where your moms and kids be
Patch on my eye like Spuds McKenzie
Strike up on the wall where your homies and friends be
Long Beach nigga we the all Crip ci-ty

[Hook]
