Meet me out, can you make it?
Please don’t make me lie to you, lady
I’m in it, I’m not in it, but poochie says there's women
At the club we finna go, sip some drink and hit some dro
It’s ok if you don’t go, I’ll make sure to tell you

So many pros (it’s like somebody’s growin’ them on trees)
So many pros (it’s like somebody’s growin’ them on trees)
So many pros (it’s like somebody’s growin’ them on trees)
So many...
