[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
From the depths of the sea, back to the block
Snoop Doggy Dogg, Funky, yes but of the Doc
Went solo on that ass, but it's still the same
Long Beach is the spot where I served my cane
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, but don't lose your grip
Nine-trizzay's the yizzear for me to fuck up shit
So I ain't holdin nuttin back
And motherfucker I got five on the twenty sack
It's like that and as a matter of fact (RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT)
Cos I never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
(Yeah check out the whole manuscript
It's Dogg Pound and Snoop Dogg rockin gangsta shh...)
What's my motherfuckin name?

[Hook: Dat Nigga Daz]
Snoop Dogg-y Dogg
Snoop Dogg-y Dogg (yeah yeah yeah)
Snoop Dogg-y Dogg
Snoop Dogg-y Dogg (The bomb)
Snoop Dogg-y Dogg
Snoop Dogg-y Dogg
Snoop Dogg-y Dogg
Snoop Dogg-y Dogg (Dogg!)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
It's the bow to the wow, creepin and crawlin
Yiggy yes y'allin, Snoop Doggy Dogg in
The motherfuckin house like everyday
Droppin shit with my nigga Mr Dr. Dre
Like I said, niggas can't FUCK with this (What?)
And niggas can't FUCK with that
Shit that I drop cos ya know it don't stop
Mr. One Eight Seven on a motherfuckin cop
Tic toc never the Glock just some nuts and a cock
Robbin motherfuckers then I kill dem blood clots
Then I step thru the fog and I creep thru the smog
Cos I'm Snoop Doggy (who?) Doggy (what?) Doggy (DOGG!)

[Hook: Dat Nigga Daz]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Now just throw your hands in the motherfuckin air (HO!)
And wave the motherfuckers like ya just don't care (HO! Dogg!)
Yeah roll up the dank, and pour the drank
And watch your step (why?) cos Doggy's on the gank (check it out!)
My bank roll's on swoll
My shit's on hit, legit, now I'm on parole, stroll
With the Dogg Pound right behind me
And up in yo bitch, is where ya might find me
Layin that, playin that G thang (ba-by)
She want the nigga with the bigger nuts, and guess what? (Snoop)
He is I, and I am him, slim with the tilted brim
What's my motherfuckin name?

[Hook: Dat Nigga Daz]

[Outro: Dat Nigga Daz]
Yeah yeah
