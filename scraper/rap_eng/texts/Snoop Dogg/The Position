[Verse 1: Mac Shawn]
I’m back at it again
Shouts out to my love and to my childhood friends
Wouldn't trade it for nothing
We was never in the front see we started to stuntin’
In the 80’s wasn't nothing, we was posted and gunnin’
Young G’s on the block, cocaine pumpin’
In a fast lifestyle, you turn nothing to something
And you got to move me when you’re part of a team
It’s a doggystyle [?] so I’m a spit that gang

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
I’m in the new school with my automatic weapon
Lock the campus down, spray around; lay it down
This song feature me-the grim reaper
New school rappers, hide behind your teacher
This fool‘ll cap ya under the bleachers
Fuck the goon and goblin nigga, I’m a creature
Fuck around and eat ya with [?]
Drama brings badaboom badabing
Champion, Cube got a lot of rings
Bill Russell mixed with Charlie Hustle bitch
You wanna tussle with the love muscle
Back up, or feel the fire from the muzzle
Figure me out, fuck no-I’m a puzzle
The answer to the riddle: ho, I never love you
The position that I play is very important
I’m out in the streets and I don’t need a warrant

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
No I don’t
Oh yes I will
Go real, sharpen up steel for steel
On spot with the Glock, can’t get 2Pac
Little homie ran up on me with the woom waa
I told you step back cuz, it’s too hot
He didn’t listen so I hit him with the boom bah
Practice, potential
Perfecting powerful resistors projecting in the pocket protection

[Verse 3: Mac Shawn]
The position I play is very important
I can’t stop now ‘cos it’s getting enormous
And never when I come, late to get mine
Y’all wait, Elohim Allah on time
Chah! Rock star is he and I
Eye to the sky and I do know why
Creatin’, motivatin’ is part of the plan
I do it for my family, friends and my fans

[Hook]
