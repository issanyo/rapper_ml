[Intro: Meek Mill]
Ooh, ooh
This that Philly-Bompton shit
Yeah, haha

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I'm on the East side rollin' with my West side niggas (West side, West side, West side)
We're just tryna do it big like that Bed-Stuy nigga
(Bed-Stuy, Bed-Stuy, Bed-Stuy)
And the feds lookin', pray they don't catch my nigga (I pray they don't catch my nigga)
Might pull up on the corner like that's my nigga
And burn this bitch down like Left Eye, nigga
That's my nigga, word up

[Verse 1: YG]
4HUnnid nigga with that .40 pound on me
Baller ammo, I got forty rounds tho
Cash out Keenon nigga with the pounds low
He count on me even when I move slow
Come through Compton with all my niggas (my niggas)
Come through poppin' with all my niggas (my niggas)
You should've seen how we looked last winter (last winter)
You should've seen how we ate last dinner
I don't fuck with them Hollywood niggas
I don't fuck with them Hollywood niggas
In the game, I'm the keep it right, nigga
'Cause all these rap niggas know my niggas wanna get 'em
Basic bitches came to suck this dick, no
Basic bitches came to fuck the clique, oh
They tryna have me on some sucker shit
I'ma do it my way nigga, fuck the script

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Came thru the block with everything that's new
Sippin' that motherfuckin' DS2
I can't fuck with him if he ain't true
They like, "He alright but he ain't you"
We like, five milli on board the ship
I was the richest nigga on the tip
Locked down with the killers and the robbers, going hard in it
Open the gate, jump on the lift
And now we headed to the westside, rolling in some hot shit
Double in the backseat, it look like a mop stick
You ain't gotta ask me, nigga, you ain't got shit
You ain't talkin' money, I see you done switched the topic
You be only fuckin' with niggas that be on cop shit
I be only fuckin' with bitches that get it poppin'
You don't wanna see one my niggas face in a stockin'
Spray up your corner over some nonsense

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I'm on the East side rolling with my West side niggas (West side, West side, West side)
We're just tryna do it big like that Bed-Stuy nigga (Bed-Stuy, Bed-Stuy, Bed-Stuy)
And the feds looking, pray they don't catch my nigga (I pray they don't catch my nigga)
Might pull up on the corner like that's my nigga
And burn this bitch down like Left Eye, nigga
That's my nigga, word up

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Can a real crip, get a lil' bit?
Dump on a nigga for some silly shit
A hundred four rounds when the milli kick, yeah
Gang bang niggas who he really with (crip!)
And we don't talk to no motherfuckin' law
Cooked up, caked up, slangin' that raw, nigga
Roll through the city, of vice
Bangin' with the loud or the silencer
Leave him on the floor with his brains spilt out
Tanners, scanners, bananas peeled out
Back to the set, no sweat, ducked off
Come through the hood and you will get fucked off
Nigga, this's crip on my, two times
Don't give a fuck and we'll bust him one time, nigga
What y'all thought? We criss to cross
You miss, your loss, we settin' it off

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I'm on the East side rolling with my West side niggas (West side, West side, West side)
We're just tryna do it big like that Bed-Stuy nigga (Bed-Stuy, Bed-Stuy, Bed-Stuy)
And the feds looking, pray they don't catch my nigga (I pray they don't catch my nigga)
Might pull up on the corner like that's my nigga
And burn this bitch down like Left Eye, nigga
That's my nigga, word up
