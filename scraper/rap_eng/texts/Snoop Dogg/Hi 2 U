Wassup baby
Chorus:

A nigga sayin hi to you (how you doin'?)
I really wouldn't lie to you ( I ain't lying)
I wanna get inside of you (mmm)
Inside of you (yes I do!)
What you try to do (Can I hit it?)
A nigga sayin hi to you (how you doin?)
I really wouldn't lie to you (that's real)
I wanna be inside of you
And after I do, goodbye to you

Verse 1:

Wash my clothes you hoes clean up the kitchen
Suck me dry, let's get high, then wash the dishes
You get three wishes if you're cute and ambitious
Like Tisha and Denisha, boy them bitches was vicious
Wicked, how I kick it, I stick it in the booty
Oops, slid it on the accident
But, when I first met her she was so innocent
So it made no sense how she suck dick for fuck of it
We did it on the wall, me and my dogg
And I met her at the mall
Lakewood, so good, when I be inside of you
I'm just tryna freak it, make it fly for you
Make you wanna come back and get another piece
And share with your peoples and tell your little niece
My khackis every crease with the rubber in my pocket
Ride it, devide it, and please don't knock it til you tried it

Chorus:

A nigga sayin hi to you
I wanna be inside of you
I know I'm lookin fly to you
I wouldn't lie to you, what am I to do?
A nigga sayin hi to you
You know I wouldn't lie to you
I wanna be inside of you
And after I do, goodbye to you [2X]

Verse 2:

Ay ay, baby who with cause your thang like tendin girl
Get it wit your fit in, and welcome to my world
Fancy cars, yachts n pools, basketball courts that's made for high schools
Backyard full of dogs, got a pawn full of fish
But a bad girl, I think that's all that's missin from my list
Unless you wanna be the girl that fill that void
And grow with a real G homeboy
I take you where you wanna be
And I strip you buttnaked right in front of me
Think I hop, beauty for that there, can see
On the floor, at the mo' gettin low
Two thirty real dirty I we ain't leavin em fo'
Close the do' and turn off the lights
I love it when you coochie me extra tight
Got you screamin dynamite, like Jay Jay
Hey hey, girl that's what happenen'

Chorus:

A nigga sayin hi to you
I wanna be inside of you
I know I'm lookin fly to you
I wouldn't lie to you, what am I to do?
A nigga sayin hi to you
You know I wouldn't lie to you
I wanna be inside of you
And after I do, goodbye to you [2X]

Verse 3:

I had a chick named Shamai, she love champagne
What a little twist the thing Alaine
She wadn't from America, so she couldn't speak English
I wipped out my ?zizag? and baby spoked dinglish
Reminds me of the supper free, that I bumped in Frisco
Same week buzzing another one up in Fresno
Hey ya'knaw, it seems that they knew what time it was
I've got a glass of Hurricane to get them all buzzed
Had them doin all type of craziness
And one freak said "All I wanna do is get a homegirl ???"
I flipped, for a second, look here I wrecked it
They gotta have that po-po, ?????????
They be we twisted, in case you missed it
See we gone keep this on the DL, It's our lil' secret
I won't tell, if you won't tell, see
Cause you gone work your thang, BANG BANG

Chorus:

A nigga sayin hi to you
I wanna be inside of you
I know I'm lookin fly to you
I wouldn't lie to you, what am I to do?
A nigga sayin hi to you
You know I wouldn't lie to you
I wanna be inside of you
And after I do, goodbye to you [2X]
