Did ya get the dank, did ya get the dank?
Yeah, I got the dank, you got the gas in the tank?
V.I.P. status, don't need an apparatus
'Cuz the niggas I fuck wit, they all about the cabbage

Down in yellobrick road my destination, the DoggHouse
Toastin' Remy's, fillin' jimmies, we goin' all out
Lookin' for the wizard, creepin' through the fog
Got some bad ass bitches, headed to the player's ball

They gon' be strippin' and wigglin' ass
Hope you brought your play a pass
Tray Dee, Goldie half dead, the twins blaze sacks
Bigger than big everyday in L.A
4 Tay representin' for the whole damn yea, Beeyotch

DoggHouse, turnin' it out
And if you ain't dope you got to get
The fuck out, that's on the O G D P
(Say what)
And that's how it is when you fuckin' wit me

Don't matter how you come, use all angles
Ties become tangled when the cutthroat strangles
My hookup, long rangers
Better float like a nationwide sky pager

Them hoes save us, talk about being play as
On the real we can deal wit you play a haters
We hit the spot, every city got a block
What you making when you take it to a different type of level that it pops

Know the Dogg keep the hip rocks, steady banging
Hoes steady sang in from the gang that we claiming
Yo, it's Waniac, the maniac
Trip Loc, won't you spit that rap?

Park my shit and jump out, I'm at the homies spot
To see if he floatin' with me up to the DoggHouse
Hit the weed he lightin', outside little niggas is fightin'
This bomb, I'm likin'

Holla at my folks I know up in the complex
Nigga ready to ride as soon as he get dressed
Now we ready to roll, hit the store, then the carpool lane
Once again it's on, big chiefin'

Remind me of the noisiest place
Ladies all over the place, and niggas super laced
How we like it, saggin' in my 5 0 1
Killin' my lungs, keeping these homies and bitches on one

Man I got warrants, bad tax, still saying fuck it
Headed up to DoggHouse swerving in a bucket
Puffin on some bomb from my comrade Blue
And got my little bitch catch a contact too

House shoes with the blue khaki suit and my locs on
Swooping to some Soopafly, getting my smoke on
Nigga Goldie Loc got the heat on roast it
4 Tay on the way plus the twins is posted

Bout to set it off bet it's off the hook
Straight crooks, getting money off the books
Making nothing but that gangsta shit that niggas loving
Thuggin' at the house party, fuck goin' clubbin'

DoggHouse, turnin' it out, and if you ain't dope you got to get
The fuck out, that's on the O G D P
(Say what)
And that's how it is when you fuckin' wit me

Let me hear you say pimps, banks, hustlers
Let's all get the money then murder these motherfuckers
Cocksuckers, they can't stop us
Now put up your choppers, just in case they rolling wit them coppers

I shut 'em down, Dogg Pound for them bitches
I be seeing you with snitches every time I'm hitting switches
Ice skating over ditches
I'm true to the game, plus I'm out to get them riches

I be mobbing down the road trying to bag up my bags
I'm saggin so hard I'm tearing up the back of my khakis
I'm trying to reach my Dogg Dirty Red
But this hoe won't let me know, which way to go
I'm moving slow

My chucks only come wit a hundred miles of walking
Hundred miles of running smelling funny and I'm gunning nigga
Dogg Pound gangsta crip for life
And we gon party in this motherfucker all damn night
