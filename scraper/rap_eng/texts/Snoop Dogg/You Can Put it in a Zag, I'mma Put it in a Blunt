It's the big mack, yeah
I got this new shit right here man
You might wanna hit this

[Chorus: x2]
You can put it in a zag, I'ma put it in a blunt
You can sit in the back I'ma sit the front
No stunt no punk it really don't matter
'Cause I got what they want

They say all day we play n blow
See this is the only thing we know
I blow kush again, on the push again
With a bad lil' cute lil' Mexican

Uh, zigzag how I roll mine
You can tell I be a G how I hold mine
I ain't into loanin' shit, I'ma own mine
Bitch fuck with me, stumble on a gold mine

Break bread or fake dead, punk bitch this is real life
Executive branch, what it feel like?
Catch me if you can I'm your local kush man
Sittin' in the stairs what a hundred grants in my pants

And I blow so much smoke
Pure OG hit it once might choke
See I'ma go kick it bitch I can poke
And you can ride too, high school take a toke

[Chorus: x2]
No stems, no seeds
Mac gave me all the class that a nigga need
Just taught my old bitch how to roll weed
And the nigga ridin' wit me gettin' high with me

? to my young nigga Devin
Got to hangin' wit Mac and now we twenty-four seven
On the go smokin' dro, deep on the west side
Bangin' where it's hood at
Yep, you gotta love that

Yep, I love that
Niggas used to offer but I wouldn't
Now I'm all askin' where the bud at
Makin' it happen me and Mac just got two bitches
Crackin' ? tryna smoke weed all night I'm down for getting tatted

Spat it up and tat it up
Suit it up and boot it up
Pioneers baby ain't nothing that you can do to us
Inhale, that's the high school
Dev and Mac, we known to act a damn fool, you dig?

You know what
It may sound crazy but uh
Yeah, Dev and Mac
High school
It may sound crazy but uh
It may sound crazy but uh
