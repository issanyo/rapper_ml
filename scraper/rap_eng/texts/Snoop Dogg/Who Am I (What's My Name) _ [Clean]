From the depths of the sea, back to the block
Snoop Doggy Dogg, funky as the, the, The D.O.C
Went solo on that a**, but it's still the same
Long Beach is the spot where I serve my 'caine
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, but don't lose your grip
Nine-trizzay's the yizzear for me to f*** up s***
So I ain't holdin nuttin' back
And m************, I got five on that twenty sack
It's like that and as a matter of fact (rat-tat-tat-tat)
Cuz I never hesitate to put a homie on his back
Yeah, so peep out the manuscript
You see that it's a must we drop gangsta s***
What's my name?

[Verse 2]
It's the bow to the wow, creepin and crawlin
Yiggy yes y'allin, Snoop Doggy Dogg in
The m*********** house like everyday
Droppin s*** with my homie Mr Dr. Dre
Like I said, niggas can't F*** with this
And niggas can't F*** with that
Shit that I drop cuz ya know it don't stop
Mr. One Eight Seven on a cop
Tic toc never the Glock just some nuts and a cock
Robbin motherfuckers then I kill dem bloodclots
Then I step through the fog and I creep through the smog
Cuz I'm Snoop Doggy (who?) Doggy (what?) Doggy [Dogg]

[Verse 3]
Now just throw your hands in the air
And wave the m************ like ya just don't care
Yeah roll up the dank, and pour the drank
And watch your step (why?) cuz Doggy's on the gank
My bank roll's on swoll
My s*** on hit, legit, now I'm on parole, stroll
With the Dogg Pound right behind me
And up in yo b*****, is where ya might find me
Layin that, playin that G Thang
She want the n**** with the biggest n***, and guess what?
He is I, and I am him, slim with the tilted brim
What's my name?

[Outro]
Oh, Snoopy Dogg, Snoopy Dogg, Snoopy Dogg (the bomb)
