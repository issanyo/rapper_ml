[Verse 1: Bobby Anthony]
I'm in the club, so damn gone
I lost my friends and I lost my phone
I'm staggering all by my lone'
Don't even know how I'll get home
But it's okay, it's alright
I'm so fresh yes, I'm so fly
I swore last night I'd give up drinking
Such a lie, what was I thinking?

[Bridge: Bobby Anthony]
I see them moving, see them dancing
Yeah they're doing that
I see them grooving, popping bottles
Like its' new to them
I wanna join them but it seems
Like they're too far for me
Plus where's the bathroom man
Cause I really, really gotta pee

[Chorus: Bobby Anthony]
Last night, I don't remember (last night)
I said I'd never (last night)
What was I thinking?
I really need to give up drinking
I'm not gon' drink again
But who am I kidding?
I'm about to call my friends tonight
And do it over again

[Verse 2: Bobby Anthony]
Fresh out the bathroom, so relieved
I make my way up to the VIP
I done tripped on a step
What the heck?
I take a quick look around
And I check my fresh
Then I proceed to-to my mission
I see a bottle
And the vodka's glistening
Good lord that looks so lovely
Pardon me while I chase this bubbly

[Bridge: Bobby Anthony]

[Chorus: Bobby Anthony]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
That's right, cash right
Shining like a flashlight
Baby shake your ass right
Cause this could be your last night
Set the mood, spoon and groom
Ladies feel my living room
Bobby A, what you say?
Ian Carey, my DJ!
Play that song, make it bang
We gon' be here all night long
If you got that feeling, feeling
Yeah, now sing the song
D.O. double G, I am sold publicly
Speak my mind, take my time
In the sky, I am fly
If you're low, come with me
Cause i can get you hella high
Join my crew, be my friend
Tomorrow night we do it again
Same time, different place
What an ass, what a face!
What a life you can have
And you don't have to pack no bags
Just get on in, and tomorrow night we do it again
That's how it is, I always does it big
Your place or mine? A case of wine?
Baby stop wasting time, so take a flight
Cause I'm only in town for one more night, ya dig?

[Chorus: Bobby Anthony]

[Outro: Bobby Anthony]
I really shouldn't have another one
But I'm just having way too much fun
So pour up another shot for you, me and your friend
Some Henny Black on the rocks
And let's all get shameless
And act famous, act famous, act famous...
