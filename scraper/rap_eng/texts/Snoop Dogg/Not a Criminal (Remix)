(Intro)
Yeah...
G MIX!
Uhh... looks like a double win for me
It's a Ultimate Victory
Chamilitary Man

Everybody get low it's a stick up everybody get low everybody get low (x4)

[Hook]
Everywhere I go-o-o
Everywhere I go they look at me like a criminal
But I'm a C-E-O-O-O
I'm a C-E-O, I'm a self employed C-E-O
I already got dough-ough-ough
I already got dough but I think it's time for me to get more
I'm a C-E-O
I'm a C-E-O, I'm a self-employed C-E-O

I'm not a criminal

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Police telling me to turn my music down yeah
I used to talk fly to 'em now I'm flying Lear
Chamillitary we bout to knock this one outta here
Going, going, going gone, yeah
Some rappers just be acting like divas
I'm a young southern money making over-achiever
Make another cash deposit give the teller a seizure
So many cars I forgot like I got Chamnesia
Big paper yea I'm hearing them talking
But I ain't believing that because I'm hearing this often
Doo-doo-doo
This number you're calling
Has been disconnected cause the sucker ain't balling
I say what's on my mind, they act like its a crime
So get my lawyer on the line, I'll be doing some time
They're trying to bring me down, tell em they can keep trying
I need that Oprah Winfrey money you know I'm gon' get mine
On the grind I'm getting my green like a vegetarian
When we done, send them to the cemetery
Keep thinking I'ma lose, I ain't ever worried
I'll probably fall off the 15th of never worried

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
I've been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces
Caught a lot of cases, and beat most of them
I came in the back door and left through the front
Shining, glistening, smoking a blunt
Beef, hmm, speak and I'ma end it
Walk by the dance floor winking at the women
Gang of bitches sagging my pants
Baby girl on my dick, Why you grabbing my hand?
You almost grabbed the magnum P-I
Sorry baby-boo I'm on my mission about my B-I
Nah - I can't mess with that
Besides, I got a motherfucking jet to catch
I'm trying to be the first rap billionaire
As I, pull on an ounce with my nephew Chamillionaire
It's so easy to see- it's like McGrady and Kobe, pay me you owe me
Top dollar with the gold flea collar
Dipping in my blue Impala
Up and down the block
Non-stop I'm a hard pill to swallow, tough act to follow
Its the dogg-father nigga holla

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Busta Rhymes]
BUSTA BUS! For short: B-U-S
You ain't know the number: B-O-S-S
C-E-O, address me properly mister
Portfolio be having multiple property pictures
62 meter long Maybachs with a chauffeur
Might negotiate your shares and invest it in Coca-Cola
I'm power moving money playing celebrity poker
On an island with bitch that just love to listen to Soca
Do different shit my money, I buy horses
Invest in a couple resorts and a couple golf courses
Before you go against me, I think you need to be cautious
Cause I got a lot of money and got a lot of resources
Chamillionaire, let us put together some cake
Quick on some Richard Branson shit and probably cop us a spaceship
Got a new A-K-A, *ching ching* Pardon!
I'm the new meaning of Profit Margin

[Hook]

Everybody get low, it's a stick up everybody get low (x2)

[Snoop Dogg Talking]
Now you know how I get down, man, let me count this money real quick

[Chamillionaire]
Not a criminal
