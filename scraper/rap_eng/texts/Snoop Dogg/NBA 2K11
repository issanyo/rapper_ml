[Intro]
What's up, who got Next? Yeah! NBA 2k11, Yeah

[Chorus]
Big Blocks, Big Shots
From the bottom, to the top
Lock him up, spot him up
Then you gon' drive
All D, All we, gonna do is win
Feels so good when the winning begins

[Verse 1]
Come and get your steam up, try to build your team up
That's the G-way when you play 2K, Aye!
What's the Game Mode, what's the new features
Can you make a jump shot, sittin' in the bleachers
I'm a teach you what you wanna know, take a shot, let it go
2k11, with the S-N-Double O
Pick and roll, dip' n dash, defense, talkin' trash
Take a 3, and all you heard was spash

My game speed... is a 85
I'm a Hall of famer, with Laker pride
I pop outside, I'll take ya inside
I'll cross you over with that old school dribble drive
You love this flow, that I bring
Back to back, on track, Roll to the ring
Teamwork, make a dream work for real though
You wanna play that dog?
You better tight'n up your skills yo
You wanna quick game
Or set your attributes and game sliders
Now execute
Now get it right, now lock'n load
Puttin' paint where it ain't, Soul in the hole
Inspiration, Domination
To be the best, that's my motivation
As I quest, none the less
Beast from the east, best from the west
Stylin', Filin'
N' when the All-star Game come, put my name in the ballot
Top of my grade, NBA 2k11, Best Game Ever made

[Chorus]
Big Blocks, Big Shots
From the bottom, to the top
Lock him up, spot him up
Then you gon' drive
All D, All we, gonna do is win
Feels so good, wanna win it again

Wanna win it again

Big Blocks, Big Shots
From the bottom, to the top
Lock him up, spot him up
Then you gon' drive
All D, All we, gonna do is win
Feels so good, wanna win it again
