Yeaaa!
Y'all niggas know what time it is, yeah
You know we about to get stupid in this motherfucker!
Yeah, all my motherfuckin' gangsta's put your motherfuckin'
Hands in the air

Who's the nigga that you love to hate?
Don't debate, bust you - dead in your face
Hold up! Wait a minute as I get down and dirty with it
Smokin' my spinach, Dat Nigga Daz is a menace
And I'm finna get gangsta with it
I'm outta the cut with some shit that I wrote
With my Dogghouse niggas, so you know I must be dope but I
Rat-tat-tat-tat that ass
What the fuck, Dat Nigga Daz won't stop
Til' I get the cash
I mash for the cars, and I'll bash your jaw
Blue and grey khakis with the All-Star's
Ten years of this gangsta shit
Bumpin' your system front and back and you know that it's
Crip
One nigga left the crew, somethin' we grew
To my monumental niggas that draped in all blue
Greyed out, with the white trim Nike's
With my first cousin Bigg Snoop Dogg right behind me
Wanna die? Try me
With them AK twins drop like siamese
Get down to grindin', yo nigga, fuck signs

Suge Knight is a fat bitch! HA HA

I be the nigga with an all gat tucked in my drawers
Why nigga? Cause I'm down by law

Cold crippin', stay dippin', still rippin'
Dippin' my cigarettes, fool I'm still trippin'
Kick on back and ease your cool
Cause everybody know that Daz and Goldie actin' fool
Snoop in the Cadillac, rollin' up the whole sack
I'm sitting in this motherfucker, holdin' on this mini-mack
So say it ain't gangsta
You one of them Rollin' 21 five boys, nigga ain't ya?
You got that right, now back your ass up here come them
Criptonites
I'm from the land of notorious gangstas (Long Beach!)
With a big "Eastside" always crip hard and stay anxious
Spittin' the heat, movin' the street

DPGC nigga, you know what I'm throwin' uuuuup!
Yeah, Dat Nigga Daz is most definately in the motherfuckin'
House

I can't quit givin' you niggas the blues
Double barrell shotty knockin' them niggas right out their
Shoes
Solo's and crews
I... cock the tool and rebuild the nigga whole frame and
Burnin' this fuse
I wasn't born to lose
I know your mind, your heart, your soul ain't what it seems
To be
When the cannon explode you and your boys is history
I told the story of a lifetime, came back with the right
Rhyme
2003 yeah it's all mine
So bow down and recognize to a boss
I made the shit up nigga, so how you talk
You better walk the walk before your ass get chalked
See I stalk the street nigga day and dark
I spark the flame, I'll leave you niggas all ashamed
With The Gang motherfucker we blast and maintain
You on the wrong side of the set, motherfucker roll it up
DPGC nigga, you know what I'm throwin' uuuuup!

Yeah! HA HA, you know what I'm throwin' uuuuup!
DPGC nigga, you know what I'm throwin' uuuuup!
And it just don't stop, Dogghoused the fuck out
Like to say what's up to my cousin Bigg Snoop Dogg
Goldie Loc, Tray Deee, my nigga Soopafly
Mr. B-A-D, Mr. Kane, Latoia Williams, my nigga E-White
And I am Dat Nigga Daz
And we gonna keep it Dogghoused out motherfucker!
So all y'all can suuuck these nuts

Now... you understand what we sayin'?
