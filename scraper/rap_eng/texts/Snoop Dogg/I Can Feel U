[Chorus]
Let me open this door for you
Now you're waiting outside
And I can feel you
Let me offer you all my love
You've been away for so long
And I've been missing you
Let me open this door for you
Now you're waiting outside
And I can feel you
Let me offer you all my love
You've been away for so long
And I've been missing you

[Verse]
I've seen it all
And lost control
Please come to me
I want you here

[Pre-Chorus]
And say let go of your fears
I'm gonna fulfill your dreams
Please let me in
I promise I'll never leave

[Chorus]
Let me open this door for you
Now you're waiting outside
And I can feel you
Let me offer you all my love
You've been away for so long
And I've been missing you
Let me open this door for you
Now you're waiting outside
And I can feel you
Let me offer you all my love
You've been away for so long
And I've been missing you

[Pre-Chorus]
And say let go of your fears
I'm gonna fulfill your dreams
Please let me in
I promise I'll never leave

[Chorus]
Let me open this door for you
Now you're waiting outside
And I can feel you
Let me offer you all my love
You've been away for so long
And I've been missing you
Let me open this door for you
Now you're waiting outside
And I can feel you
Let me offer you all my love
You've been away for so long
And I've been missing you
