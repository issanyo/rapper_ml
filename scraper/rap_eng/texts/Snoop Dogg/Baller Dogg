[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah on the real to be honest witchu
Some of this gangbang, you know that gangbang shit
Hehe aw yeah
Yeah, uh
What y'all know about this?
Some of that gangbang boogie
Some of that bang-bang boogie
Check this out

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
One lil, two lil, three lil G's
Hangin' out bangin' and swangin' they keys
Across the street, peep for the enemies
Nigga got a tec-nine slid up in them trees
Just in case one of they bigger OG's
Take these G's for fleas, nigga freeze
Nigga ain't afraid to squeeze
Nigga me and my boys is off the heezy
Slide through in the 7-duece coupe deville
For real, chop game, while choppin' trees
Smokin' on the [?] named sunkist
Nigga can't dump this, nigga gotta bump this
Just get the twist, the shit you can't miss
While you smokin' on the joint wit' a fat bitch
The game gettin' fun and everyone wanna laugh
Everybody wanna be a player wit' no coaching staff
I'm gigglin', scribblin' game on the paper
Like Master P and Tony Draper
I'm independent, that's big money maker
With a coat at the house built for a Laker

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Trip, I got hoes, clothes, a Rolls with the...
Security in the backseat strapped with heat
Rollin' through the east side of LBC
On a mission for them wannabes and them wanna-G's
Four, or five, or six lil skeez die for them baby, eat deez

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I slid up in the parking lot at Mickey D's
I order me some fries, a shake, wit' triple cheese
Baby at the register, man she couldn't believe
Beggin' for my autograph, tuggin' on my sleeves
Screamin' "D-O-double-G's please don't leave"
Pullin' on my dick and she fell to her knees
I wish I had the time, I'd love to get skeezed
But I gotsta breeze, I'm in the 8 Tray reg-
Fire up the trees with my dogg H-Deez
Finna get the rest, up the D-P'z
Stay, gotta party off in the HGC's
Is hostin' it, west coastin' shit
I got my khakis and my wallabees
Wit' my golf hat tilted to the back, way too G
East side, LBC, wit' these shackles off my feet
I'm free and full of weed

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
I got hoes, clothes, a Rolls with B
I put out my records independently
That way nigga ain't no gankin' me
And uh, that's how we do it in the LBC
It's like seven lil, eight lil, nine lil kids
And they all in tattooed tears
It's like seven lil, eight lil, nine lil kids
And they all in tattooed tears nigga

[Verse 2: Lil C Style]
I'm glad to be a muthafuckin' lil ass G
Cause they don't make lil ass niggas like me
Pimp hoes till they leave and shoot dice wit' teasers
And send money to my G's in the penitentiaries
See it's niggas like that that I need
So when you hear my name in jail you better speaks well
Cause you never know which one of my homies is in the cell
The beach do it swell, so check out how I feel

[Verse 3: Techniec]
You gotta be off the wall to represent this
One in the house, kick the doors off the hinges
Damn serving a life sentence
I know niggas that break out
Control they own chips and serve like cake out (who me?)
Y'all stay duckin' (Doug E.) like Fresh
And p.s.s. while he mugs to dug we true thugs
Don't kick it with busters unless the food out
38 especially for the shootout
Only six shots, gotta roll with it
Hold it, just until I find a stash make the fo'-fo' fit
Tryna stay in the game, ain't tryna forfeit
Y'all suckas out there be on some hoe shit
Like ten, eleven, twelve lil niggas
All from Long Beach and tryin' to make figures
Y'all playa hatin' chumps gon' have to come get us
It's a gang of riders and we keep some heat wit' us

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
We got hoes, clothes, a Rolls with B
And put out our records independently
That way nigga ain't no gankin' me
And uh, still got love for the LBC
It's like one lil, two lil, three LBC's
Rollin' wit' the DPG's
It's like four lil, five lil LBC's
And they rollin' wit' the DPG's nigga

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
