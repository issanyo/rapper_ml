[Snoop Dogg]
Yo dogg, niggas always asking me
"Is the muthafuckin DPGC still together?"
Niggas gon ask me
"Dogg ya'll still together, I heard ya'll broke up like the fat boys."
Nigga what, nigga this Dogg Pound for life nigga
We ain't going nowhere nigga
And matter of fact, you actin foolish right now with all that shit you kick
Nigga everywhere I go niggas be actin foolish
And uh, I'm a deal with that shit DPG style

[Kurupt]
I'm a rider, the first local stock pilot
Now what the fuck made you think the DP divided
Moving on up to the top of the map
Because gangsta will be here till the curl comeback
I'm moving down to block D, me and my homies
The Dogg Pound would rock overseas, immense degrees
No bitch niggas in the circle
Beat a nigga in his face till his fuckin eyes turn purple

[Daz Dillinger]
I told myself watch out for my family and health
I got my shit together, got the gauge up shelf
Knowing the rules have chose to hang out with the dummies and fools
Old school Poda Dada that I knew from way back to school
Attitude shitty, kept it raw and gritty
Uncut, me and my dawgs fuckin it up
What up

[Snoop Dogg]
Fuckin it up, fuckin it up for life nigga, Dogg Pound, ya heard
If I hear another nigga talking about what he gon do, to who
To me and my crew, nigga the grey and the blue
You through, you knew you shouldn't have done that
Now how the fuck you figure that we wasn't gon comeback
The D, the P, the G to C
Westcoast's finest and I'm a put that on me
See niggas been rappin but they ain't sayin shit
Nigga shut the fuck up, get off my dick

Chorus
Don't be foolish x2

You see you don't wanna fuck with us
Knowing how we throw it out, the sucka niggas want to imitate us
Cause all we wanna do is put the G right back in you
Yeah worry about your muthafuckin punk ass crew
And we keeps it gangsta fool, thats gangsta, keep it gangsta fool

[Snoop Dogg]
Trip, we got more dough than rock up, more niggas to lock up
You niggas need to strap up or pack up
See because this world we live in is crazy, and the people they so sick
See why I keeps it gangsta and I ride with the sickest clique
And when it comes to gun play, hell yeah we the quickest biach

[Daz Dillinger]
And oh my momma and my daddy, grandpapa and my granny
Homeboy you can't fuck with this

[Kurupt]
Smooth when we come through
The DP when we come through the gangstas is in the house
And all you muthafuckin niggas and you muthafuckin bitches
Get a muthafuckin dick in your mouth
I'm a gangsta I thought you knew, G'd up, grey and blue
Dippin through on the coop, made you blue
Kurupt and Snoop, Daz in the muthafuckin bomb ass clique
We gangstas nigga, laid back thinkin I tell you how it is in the hood
Where all my homies at, straps in Cadillacs
Hittin switches like e'yday, livin like the G way like e'yday, DPG-C

Just bullshittin man this dude done told me the Dogg Pound broke up
Wait till I catch that nigga, I'm a beat him down
Wait till I, wait till I catch em
