[Intro: Houston]
Buzz, this is Houston
Uh, we've got about ten minutes left now
Ten minutes left now
Prior to commencing your aviation activities

[Buzz Aldrin aka Doc Rendezvous]
All you need is the rocket experience
What you need is the rocket experience
All you need is the rocket experience

[Hook]
To go flying into outer space
See this world is a beautiful place
All mankind one human race

[Buzz Aldrin aka Doc Rendezvous]
I'll tell a story 'bout my time on the moon down
The sky was black even though the sun shined down
Moon walking is a trip, it's so fine
When you're walking in the lunar dust

It took us four days riding on a rocket
To set foot for the very first time
I'm gonna tell you 'bout the meaning of it all
We came in peace for all mankind

Imagine a place above the sky
Riding orbits in ninety minutes' time
All you need is to come with me
I'll be your guide

[Hook]
To go flying into outer space
See this world is a beautiful place
All mankind one human race

[Buzz Aldrin aka Doc Rendezvous]
Are you ready to put on your spacesuit?
Strap in for the G-force liftoff?
Countdown is getting very close now
To the adventure of a lifetime

I've been there, now I say it's your turn
All we've got to do is make the engine burn
Let's take a trip on an orbital spaceship
This is how we will reach the stars

[Mission control]
Now that's the spirit
Make sure you've got your feet underneath you
Lack of gravity

[Breakdown]
Lack of gravity

[Buzz Aldrin aka Doc Rendezvous]
All you need is the rocket experience
(mission control chatter)
What you need is the rocket experience
(Buzz, you are cleared for takeoff)
All you need is the rocket experience
(We're number one on the runway)
It's all you need

[Hook]
To go flying into outer space (I am the spaceman)
See this world is a beautiful place (I am the rocket man)
All mankind one human race (It's time to venture far)
(Let's take a trip to Mars)
(Our destiny is to the stars)

[Outro]
Mission sequence start
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
All you need is the rocket experience
