[Verse 1: Audio Playground]
I closed the door
Can't take no more
Why you're rushing for, my baby?
I just ignore
The things you said before
Time to set the score

[Pre-Hook: Audio Playground]
My baby, slow down
Cause I don't follow
Your ego's leaving ground
Like there's no tomorrow
My baby, slow down
Cause I don't follow
Your ego's leaving ground

[Hook: Audio Playground]
We're having an emergency
Go call the paramedics
Cause I'm losing it
The girl has gone insane and now she's losing me
We're nothing like we used to be
Used to be
No, we're having an emergency

[Verse 2: Audio Playground]
The engine's dead
The words you said
You're in the danger zone, my baby
We're closing up
I caught your bluff
Now we're on our own

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Make the call, 9-1-1
It's going down, pop the gun
Lots of fun, da da di
Sa ra pi, D.O. double G
In the place, turn up the bass
In your face
Anesthetics, call the paramedics
You know why?

[Hook]

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Baby girl, give it up
Party all night til you can't get up
Do your stuff, I'mma huff and puff
And give it to ya til you can't get enough
Emergency, urgency
We don't stop, we don't sleep
And while you're watching the clock
9-1-1, better call the cops
Like that there?
Rewind the song, cause I'm out of here
Rewind the song, cause I'm out of here
