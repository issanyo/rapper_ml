[Chorus]
Fux with the tux
You got to fux with the tux
Are you ready?
Fux with the tux
You got to fux with the tux
Are you ready?

We're on our way
And we won't stop 'til we reach the top
(No, we ain't never gonna stop)
Town to LA
It's the hottest thing that ever dropped
(Ooh, the hottest thing that ever dropped)

Fux with the tux
You got to fux with the tux
Are you ready?
Fux with the tux
You got to fux with the tux
Are you ready?

[Verse 1]-Snoop Dogg
Ooh wee
We got ourselves another one
No complaining
Just champagne-ing
'Cause the only time you wear a tuxedo
Is when it's time to party
You don't need to flex
It's just the T-U-X
Ho!

[Bridge]
We're on our way
And we won't stop 'til we reach the top
(We won't stop)
Town to LA
It's the hottest thing that ever dropped
(Ooh, the hottest thing to drop)

[Chorus]
Fux with the tux
You got to fux with the tux
Are you ready?
Fux with the tux
You got to fux with the tux
Are you ready?

[Outro]
Fux with the tuxedo
Let's have some fun
That gangsta boogie funk
It's number one

Fux with the tuxedo
Let's have some fun
That gangsta boogie funk
It's number one
