[Intro]
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God– Oh– Oh my God

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
The club is packed, I rap the rap
Ladies are in here from front to back
And they love my soul I reply:
Baby girl, don't you know that I am the fly?
Hands in the sky, don't ask why!
Party on down with a big bow wow!
I got style, got flare, got you right there
I got enough stock to make you do that dance
So come one, come all, just havin' a ball
Be aware of the owner cause the owner's a Dogg!
I got y'all back off the wall

[Chorus: Arash and Snoop Dogg]
Just let me know, know, know
I like the way that you talk
I like the way that you walk
Crash! Boom! Bang! You're so beautiful
Wait till we kiss, give me your lips
Crash! Boom! Bang! You're so beautiful
Woah
Woah, I'm gonna make you say "Oh my God"
Wow! Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oomph, wow, oh my God
Oh my God
I make you wanna say oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
Oomph, wow, oh my God
Oh my God
I make you wanna say... oh my God, oh– oh– oh my...

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Baby, baby wanna be my lady? Let's take a ride in my blue Mercedes
Green grass, sitting on the beanbag
Close your eyes so that the dream lasts
No fadin' away, just blaze the J
Night will turn to amazing day
You and I, I and you, let's do what lovers do...
Do that dance, so do that– do that dance
Do that dance, so do that– do that dance
Do that dance, so do that– do that dance

[Chorus: Arash and Snoop Dogg]
Just let me know, know, know
I like the way that you talk
I like the way that you walk
Crash! Boom! Bang! You're so beautiful (Oh my God)
Wait till we kiss, give me your lips
Crash! Boom! Bang! You're so beautiful
Woah (Oh my God)
Woah, I'm gonna give you everything you want
Wow! Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oomph, wow, oh my God
Oh my God
I make you wanna say oh my God, oh– oh– oh my...
Woah
Woah, oh my God– oh– oh my God
