[Intro]
[?] get your ass over there and go take a picture with Santa Claus
Ho Ho Ho! Hey little fella
Hey Santa
Tell Santa what you want for Christmas
I want a scientist set, rock collection, venom toys, and my mom and dad to get married
And what else?
And I want three ho's for the holidays

[Snoop Dogg]
Ho Ho Ho! Yessir!
Santa Claus coming to the ghetto

[Chorus]
3 ho's for the holidays
3 ho's for the holidays
3 ho's for the holidays
This is the season for you

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Long spliff for the [?]
A lot of gifts for the seasons
Pulled up in a convertible
Bag full of toys for the kids and the neighborhood
Naughty or nice, party tonight
What do you like
You been living life
Staying involved, loving it all
Woah, woah, woah
Ho, ho, ho

[Chorus]
3 ho's for the holidays
3 ho's for the holidays
3 ho's for the holidays
This is the season for you
3 ho's for the holidays
3 ho's for the holidays
3 ho's for the holidays
This is the season for you

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
All I want for Christmas is my baby
Boss lady, that's by tay tay
We can lay around and sip a cup of eggnog
By the fireplace snuggled up on Doggy Dogg
I write it in the sky very legible
With a mistletoe, this will end incredible
I got my eyes on [?]
Now homie hit me with the Christmas carol

[Bridge]
This ain't the season for kiss and tell
This ain't the season for wedding bells
This is the season for you

[Chorus]
3 ho's for the holidays
3 ho's for the holidays
3 ho's for the holidays
This is the season for you
3 ho's for the holidays
3 ho's for the holidays
3 ho's for the holidays
This is the season for you
