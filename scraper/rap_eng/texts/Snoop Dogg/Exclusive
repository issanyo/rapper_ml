[Intro: Snoop Dogg + Joe Beast]
Yo what up, this is Bigg Snoop Dogg
Ayo Red Spyda, play that shit nigga
Yeah, Joe Beast and The Game, Aftermath Entertainment
Whoo Kid classic, the 'math in yo’ ass bitch

[Verse 1: The Game]
Who the best MC on the west, by far it's me
And my car is a continental T, had my broad in that continental suite
With (?) rollin' up dutches like that muthafucka
Got beef with the kid, click-clack muthafucka
Let the bullets burn your six pack muthafucka
Get jacked, muthafucka when you come to Compton
Get the mac muthafucka when you come to Compton
When I walk through Times Square, holdin’ my johnson
Will cause Styles and J to run through Yonkers
I got D-blocks like The Lox and these Glocks like to pop
And nigga I like your watch so roll over
You can die with your jewelry
First nigga take the stand and testify, he gon' die with the jury
And I might kidnap the judge
Or send a team to lean on the prosecutors so the DA budge
I've got niggas that'll ride for a grand
So handle my rock like Earl Manigault, you can die where you stand
You got his back, you can die witcha man, or run now
I'll let you jog for about thirty seconds then you gunned down

[Outro: The Game]
Yeah nigga, Aftermath muthafucka
Joe Beast and The Game, somebody better holla
Ayo Whoo Kid, better call the police nigga
The kids done broke out the fuckin' daycare man
Y'all niggas better watch us, '03 Aftermath who fuckin’ wit’ us?
If it ain't Whoo Kid we not spittin’ on it
Suck my dick, holla
