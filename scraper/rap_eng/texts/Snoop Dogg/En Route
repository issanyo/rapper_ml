[Chorus: KJAY]
We on our way up to the top, they call me huncho
Good at the moment but I hope we see tomorrow
Making this music that I know the people follow
Good vibes and money what we screaming, that's the motto
We on our way, we on our way, up to the top now
We do not play, you in the way, you getting knocked down
W-w-w-w-w-what's my name? They call me huncho

[Verse 1: KJAY]
I'm eating on the beat I got it straight from London
My flow so nasty, when your armpits smell like onion
I make 'em fall, I chop 'em down, Paul Bunyan
KJAY go stupid on these tracks, I'm having fun man
These instrumentals that were cooked up by Kundai
Served on a plate, told me to eat, it's only right (Told me to eat)
Just watch me, I'm up on the rise
I swear that they sleeping, I open they eyes
Stepped foot in the game, now I'm making it mine
I spit forever if it don't pay a dime
Because I do it for more than just getting money
Release emotions that I feel that's tryna stand above me (Above me)

[Chorus: KJAY]
We on our way up to the top, they call me huncho
Good at the moment but I hope we see tomorrow
Making this music that I know the people follow
Good vibes and money what we screaming, that's the motto
We on our way, we on our way, up to the top now
We do not play, you in the way, you getting knocked down
W-w-w-w-w-what's my name? They call me huncho

[Verse 2: Kundai & Melis.C]
More than the money, fam this about legacy
None of them puppies are inside my pedigree
Cook up the beats like I got secret recipe
No time for bullshit no fake niggas next to me
Bitch it's Kundai x KJAY
Shit's going down, no may day
Couple dons tried disrespecting my old shit
But now they fuck with me like Dre day
Bow wow wow yippyo yippy yay
I was spitting these bars in the morning like sway
Way she throwing it back, like her ass a grenade
And I'm making it clap, pussy tight like a braid
Tryna get my pockets fat like I never heard of summer body
And my bro loves doing dirt like it was a hobby
And it's money over bitches we dont love nobody
Except for when she lets me bun while she gives me noddy

[Verse 3: Hene]
I'm steady focused, niggas know this
Pen to the pad like it was hocus pocus
Magic with the stylie it ain't hard to notice
Even American niggas fuck with the whole conglomerate
So how you gonna hate fam you're just intolerant
I'm a student of the game, even got my doctorate
Light up a spliff and get your bitch to slop on it
Said I'ma light up a spliff and get your bitch to drop on it
Feeling like I'm snoop
Told my ting to drop it like it's hot
Yeah, sipping gin and juice
Yeah we on the loose
Coming straight for the neck of the game
Strangle it like a noose
Told the haters I'ma be rich by 28
They all looked at me funny tryna throw some shade
Said i'ma make my first milly then replicate
I've failed my mission if I leave this earth
Anything less than a fucking great
I do my ting and it's done with ease
All these bitches wanna follow and they follow me
My flow come hot like a furnace yeah a hundred degrees
Yeah I'm the illest with the flow and I didn't even sneeze
Everytime I jump on the track yeah I'm spitting that greaze
Soon doing up trips overseas to Belize
Told your bitch she looks nice so she got on her knees
