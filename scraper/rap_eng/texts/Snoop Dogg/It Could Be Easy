It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy

But you probably won't believe me
That's why I smoke around
Doggy style they see me on TV
Trying had just to beat me
She knows who I am plus my team is undefeated
I am the man in my city if you wanna it I got the key
What you wanna ? without a ? everything you see I own I ain't got to lease
If you feel out of control better put that hoe on a leash

It could be easy
If you are listen to what I am trying to tell you
Every dime pays but they catch ? messing with their ?
? tell her you win her heart ? cross kind of familiar
I ain't tripping I am ? another one I got a couple of problems with my bitches
? pimping it could be easy
I am rolling ? police and don't ask where I have been got ?
Haters talk when I leave they just ? when they see what they want and they need me
I am a fucking game genie young nigga but I make it look easy
It could be easy
Money too stay fly

It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy

Flying on a plane plane
? to this fame fame
Never the same game
Ask me if a game bang
If a ?
The track is where I kick it
Until you start to pick up I look your ?
? is real hard but you can make it easy
I ain't questionable now baby please me
And once I get independent I make you need me
Like I roll weed baby start with now she need me
Believe me you complete me protect the spite
? school lay low ? on my ? English ? kush low
I am gonna go home baby ? be home alone
Now she is sucking on her own ?
It could be easy
But small things make it so hard
It could be easy
Tell me what you really do
Who you are
It's been down before
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy

It could be easy
But small things make it so hard
It could be easy
It's been down before i think you should know
