[Intro: Snoop Dogg (Charlie Wilson)]
Y'all remember?
(Do y'all remember)
Remember

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Did y'all remember how it useta be
Wasn't no trippin', we all family
Hold hands with me, make plans with me
For once in a lifetime, here's your chance to be
Now dance for me
Like you did when you was a kid
It wasn't where you was from, it was where ya lived
I give, to the girls when they got up outta church
Pray for me, that I don't get hurt
I gotta work, I'm tryna get some G's
What you scheme?
As the stars are gone
[?]
Now tha police, gettin' tricky
They sent 'em, we out
Undercover, to get me
Contradict me, but I'm just too slippery
Somehow, someway them muthafuckas missed me
While they nappin' I'm rappin', stackin'
And lookin' for them niggas on the move, that's jacking
Their deposits hot, but ya not
Prepare to shoot or get shot
Long as it's from me to you or you to me
It really don't matter unless you say you gon' bring the thing
Cause I'm a g from the old school
I squab from the shoulders, whole thangs over
Don't call me Snoop or Calvin [?]
Thinking a nigga young cause a nigga getting older


[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhh
I keep a gat in my pants, just incase ya check

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Aye, it ain't the love just cause he black
I'll put you on the map like that
Now, I'll give ya dap, if you's a real one
That kill for the right thang
Not for the wrong thang!
Grab [?]
And get ya gangbang on mane
And do it like they used to do on Soul Train
When I was a little bitty nigga from the city
There wasn't no killin', dealin', just happy feelin's
I'mma take it back to how it was
If you down wit' me can I get a right on cuz
(right on)

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
I keep a gat in my pants just in case ya checkin'
(6x)

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson]
Not just knee deep, she was going real deep when she went down on me
(3x)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Now I know I gots to get it cause I want it now I gots to have it
See this the West coast anthem
Now is that tragic?
If yo' set and my set, yo' hood and my hood
Nigga it's all to the good
That's how we do it in the 9-8
No playa hate
Just take some shades and regulate
And represent the Golden State
And get them muthafuckas swole in the face
I need bank, like Dre used to make
When NWA was in the muthafuckin' place
The case was dropped, Cristal was popped
Then the big Dogg got snatched by the cops
No longer will Dogg be given ya muthafuckin' props
I'm grown now, on my own now
Not my daddy but pop goes the weasel
For tryna play me in the paint like Shaq Diesel
See i'm a lil man wit' a big thang
But I'd rather make big change in the game
See the block gets hot when ya not prepared to shoot or get shot
So for me and you or you and me
It really don't matter what ya say ya gonna do to me
Cause I'm a G from the old school
I squabble from the shoulders till the whole thangs over
Don't call me Snoopy
[?]
Think a nigga dumb cause a nigga gettin' older

[Chorus: Charlie WIlson]

[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
I keep a gat in my pants just in case ya checkin'
(2x)
Not just knee deep, she was going real deep when she went down on me
