[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
All I know and all I do is
D-P-G with the rest of my crew
We thru with Milken Milli Vanilli
Silly Niggas who be rappin but they really be actin'
I'm smackin' niggas in they face
For the 9-8
My DJ Warren G and my homeboy Nate
The game won't wait
So we paper chase
And watch out for them suckas who paper-hate
Try to drop some shit to keep you straight
Keep my niggas on a mission
But my success, oh yes it's fresh
Here's a toast to my LB for life
You can call me when you wanna
Or can catch me in the Navigator bendin' in the corner
I representin', just like Billy Clinton
I smack a bitch for my chips and dip
For Dogg Pound Gangsta Click

[Chorus (x2):]
Don't you wanna come with me to Dogg Pound Gangstaville
We can give you what you need in Dogg Pound Gangstaville

[Nate Dogg]
Once upon a time in the land of the foolish man
There lived a man who claimed to be foldin' aces in hand
He played wrong once and played 'em twice
And played 'em wrong again
Now it's my turn to play the game
And I guarantee I win
Very best I have to be and I hope you understand
I got my game from Gangstaville
Eastside of Gangsta Land

[Chorus]
[Kurupt]
Well you can give me half your loot, nigga
Or else I'ma shoot, nigga
I do what Gz do- I ride
I slide, I drips double 4's fool
Where's the clips
You'll find I hit your spine
And shake your hips with hollow tips
It's the modern day me
With the state of art modern day heat
Mutherfuckin' modern day G
No good for for sho good
Put this nigga on the hood
And let me put him back the fuck off
Like that, you fuckin' with the Kobe Bryant of rap
With a Mack 11 cocked back ready for sure, ready for war
For real enter if you will
In the land we call Dogg Pound Gangstaville
All we do is smoke and just so you know
My motto is fuck you bitch and fuck a hoe

[Chorus (x3)]
