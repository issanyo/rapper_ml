[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Look, open your eyes, déjà vu
In ways I knew my focus remains on you
I'm so true, I love that, 'cause who woulda knew?
LBC, me? Do what it do
Question: is your bathwater ready for ya?
'Cause I could be the man for ya
Baby, are your bills paid?
Were those dinner reservations made?
The whistles, the bells, how 'bout your hair?
What about your nails?
See I can have it done for ya
Looks like I'm the one for ya
I'll crack the whip and get a little action in here, my dear
But first, relax a bit, the questions and answers are clear

[Chorus: John Legend]
A holiday
What you wanna do? Want to do with you
Let's make everyday a holiday
What you wanna do? Want to do with you

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
(Takeoff!) Smile at you (smile) I got my eyes on you (eyes)
I wanna climb on you
Can I ride with you? (can I?) touch the sky with you? (phew)
A-huh-huh-huh-huh
Say the place and we go where you wanna go (where?)
She say Rodeo, I say I'm thinking 'bout Tokyo (Tokyo)
With the top gone, won't turn up the stereo (stereo)
Singing every word of my song that's on radio (aye)
I'ma roll one, I know that you don't smoke (I know)
Sit back, let your mind float (phew) never give up hope (no)
And if ya got a problem, let me know (let me know)
I try my best to keep you close
The life we in, no boss to match 'em on the ropes (ooh)
If I'm top ten, to win, I gotta be the GOAT (GOAT)
I feel like when I step in (what?) gotta make an announcement
But y'all know (but y'all know)

[Chorus: John Legend]
A holiday
What you wanna do? Want to do with you
Let's make everyday a holiday
What you wanna do? Want to do with you
Let's make everyday a holiday
What you wanna do? Want to do with you
Let's make everyday a holiday
What you wanna do? Want to do with you
Let's make everyday a holiday

[Outro: John Legend]
Ahhhh, yeah, whoa yeah
I wanna make everyday, make it a day, ayy
