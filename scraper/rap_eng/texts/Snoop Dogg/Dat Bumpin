[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I heard a new beat, somebody say they smashed it
Well if Daz ain't do it I can't mash wit' it
And that's on DP, D-A-Z always got them bumpin' bombay beats
For your system, in your raggedy car
Oh your lady's getting crazy at the topless bar
Ain't no stopping this hard, hip hop fanatical, beats cold
Uh-uh you know it, Dogg Pound Gangsta flavor
Misbehavior, baby hit me on the pager
It's too major, the way we keep it going now
My cuzzn Daz hooked this groove so it's going down

[Pre-Hook: Snoop Dogg]
You in the coupe with Snoop
It make you say di-du-ti-du-grid-oove
It can't stop till you get it, got it
Now move to this groove

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
We move mountains, flow like fountains
Make so much paper we need four accounts
So keep bouncin' to that gangsta-gangsta
We back on the block, but we ain't come with the same stuff
We stacked it up differently, in fact specifically
The Corleone song so strong it put you in the zone of your own
Nappy-headed, dreaded, yeah I said it
Get ya comb and uh grab ya bones
Cause the junkyard Dogg brought her back a gravy train
And thangs ain't the same with this Dogg Pound Gang
So many niggas fell off, yeah I let 'em bell off
Cause me and spanky loco, man we doing well off
I give a toast to you fleas who became my enemies
We on a mit-ash wit' hizz-ash, all about the kid-ash

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm known through the world as OG Snoop Dogg
I'm known through the world for fadin' 'em all
See, me and my kinfolk kick ass all the time
Wit' da coldest beats and da coldest rhymes
All the time I gets in you when you gets geniune
Feel the draft, as Snoop Dogg starts to combine
Uh, turn up the treble and uh turn up the bass
Cause-uh this shit bumpin' like lil style face
See-uh, we came wit' who got some gangsta shit like Doggystyle
Murder was the case and Dogg Food for 9-5
And 9-6 I'ma gon' be the shiznit
Doggfather in your system nigga check dis
I get wit' 'em, get tragic, I get 'em, got wit' 'em in all kinds of ways
Come wit' the bombay uh
