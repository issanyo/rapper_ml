CHORUS: From my hood to yo hood, Slangin, slangin
From my hood to yo hood, bangin, bangin
From my hood to yo hood slangin, slangin
From my hood to yo hood, bangin, bangin, It's all good

Kane: Could these dope tapes
Bag em up, ship em straght to the niggas That don't give a fuck
Fuck the magazines
Fuck the T.V. shows
Only trying to please those
Niggas smoking indo, wit afros
Deep in da hood
Da slangers
Da bangers
Da niggas up to no good that feel my Same anger
NO LIMIT coming up
We got the Bentleys, Ferrahi's, da Benzes, and da Lexus' trucks
You know us
It's the boys KANE & ABEL
Sittin on my leather sofa
Watch myself on cable
Ask them hoes if my game precise
My shit tight ice shine like Sparks and Light
VVS 2 Karats on my pinky
Like to have sex wit 2 ho's cause I'm kinky
We rap hustlas
Like hand to hand crack hustlas
Strictly for the soldiers and none for the Busters

CHORUS (X2)

In a smoked out Tahoe
Sittin low
Gettin down
Some niggas such ho's
They probably pee sittin down
In the lexus', Land Cruisers
Chopping game wit FIEND
Waitin on big V
To bring this ??box wit da triple beam
Niggas got anger
We livin in danger
Steady puttin dead niggas in my CD Changer (Puffy)
21
Hella funs and guns
Nigga hit da blunt slow
It's my only one

Mr. ABEL
My brother
Mr. KANE
Stay TRU to the game
Sunshine or rain

CHORUS

SNOOP: From my hood to yo hood
But look it
