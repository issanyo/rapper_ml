[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Keep some killers by my side, do this shit worldwide
Keep some killers by my side, do this shit worldwide

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I’m a lover, and a fighter, gangsta and a rider
Eastsider, a rip rider—but y’all knew that from the giddy
Way cold, bold, stroll with control
And shuttin’ down shops around the muthafuckin’ globe
Puttin’ dicks in yukmouths (biatch), watch these bitches fold
Don’t speak on mine, cuz, unless you tryna get T-rolled
Kee-kee-kee-keep it on, freak-freak-freak ya dome
Stop, nah’mean, ya don’t quit, bitch
So many fuckin’ lawsuits and court cases
Snitches and probation, look at what I’m facing
Either you want me to give you some type of explanation
Or sympathize—fuck that, cuz, I’m from the side
Where we ride and the weak fall off and the snitches get clipped
And from me to you, loco, that’s just some real shit
I’ma sit back and get my hair braided
Roll this dope and get faded, blaze it and blaze it—it’s so amazing

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Keep some killers by my side, do this shit worldwide
Keep some killers by my side, do this shit worldwide
Keep some killers by my side, do this shit worldwide
Keep some killers by my side, do this shit worldwide

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Six in the morning, niggas up at my door
Reached under the pillow for the .44
See, you know it’s a murder show
It ain’t that hard to just pull it, passing bullets and making tires smoke
Heard me, Snoop Dogg? Yesterday you had me tore up
Smoke a half-zip a day, about four pounds a week
Went back to drinking O.E., just to see what I could see
Under the snakeskin, a bunch of fake grins, shakin’ ‘em
It’s just me and O.E., I shoot a slug off of weak and making sure my shit heat
Save your death certificate receipt ‘cause life don’t come cheap
About five thousand G’s to put you six feet deep
But compliments of me, it’s free
Murder dead red ‘em to the tie ‘cause I fed him
Human meat in my Cutlass wrapped up in wax paper
I don’t be fuckin’ with niggas, I do my own capers
Roll vegas, chocolate Phillies, and them brown paper zags
55 percent of my cash be on the green minty bags
Drag niggas like Newports down the street to the spot
And rape ‘em with the AK barrel, shoot like a sparrow after it pop
Bounce with one more ounce to smoke, that’s how it goes
From Sacramento to the S-O-C-A-L-A with Snoop D-O-double the G-Y

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Keep some killers by my side, do this shit worldwide
Keep some killers by my side, do this shit worldwide
Keep some killers by my side, do this shit worldwide
Keep some killers by my side, do this shit worldwide

[Verse 3: Warren G]
Vida loca, let me smoke’a
I’m in the game, fuck the fame, making niggas know my name
You could call me G, or you could call me Dub
But nigga make sure, you show me plenty love
I’m riding Eastsiders, 6-deuce and four Impalas
Staying lowkey while my killers pop collars
Potna, playa, you 5 on it hater
Nigga, this LBC, fool, y’all scrubs can’t fade us

[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Back to the game, don’t fuck me
Big Snoop Dogg and X-to-the-Z
Most of y’all could never get this deep
Get involved or get slapped with the heat
Back the fuck up, it’s my turn now
Put trust in you and just got let down
Tinted sounds, stick around for the work
Shake the spot, you run from gunshot
Hennessy rap, I love to smoke pot
Used to buck niggas with Glock, slang rock
Before I punch a 9-to-5 clock, me and mine go right out to your spot
Kick the door down for old time’s sake
Release the hate from this snub .38
Kick it with niggas that push rhymes like weight
Golden State, give a fuck if you relate, bitch

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Keep some killers by my side, do this shit worldwide
Keep some killers by my side, do this shit worldwide
