[Hook: Big Bub]
This why they show me mad love all around the world
This why they show me mad love all around the world
This why they show me mad love all around the world
This why they show me mad love all around the world

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I'm represented by Fetti, I'm so hardcore
Feet to the floor, up on a cord
Kick open the door, not knowing the score
I'm tatted and matted, added, that's 4 to the 4
Now we say, well is he good or he great?
Don't even wait, just clean the food off your plate
Say your grace, for the life that you make
Now he butted and skutting, cutting the knife in the steak
Wow, I'm and out of TI, all about it
Cause I handle my BI, CI, I see you
Wanna get a flair, no faking
Let's take it cause I love this shit

[Hook: Big Bub]
This why they show me mad love around the world
This why they show me mad love around the world
This why they show me mad love around the world
This why they show me mad love around the world

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now when I'm on tour, my spirit's unpure
And there's no cure for sure but I adore
I walk around the town and I explore
I'm greeted by 100 fans at my front door
Encore is what they want, much more
I'm smooth like suede with a touch of valore
On the rocks, Ciroc, glass and I pour
Snoop Dogg is the shit, get your ass on the floor
You can choose best and 2 step to this
Smoked up cause my weed is the shit
Take down and break down the verse
Put the S in your chest when worst comes to worst

[Hook: Big Bub]
This why they show me mad love all around the world
This why they show me mad love all around the world
This why they show me mad love all around the world
This why they show me mad love all around the world

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah all around the world
Big Bub, Snoop Dogg
Real love
From the streets to the suites
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I been
Love, love
Go head, go head, go head
Say that, say that, say that
Oh yeah they do
Another classic
That's real love right there man
All around the world
Shout out to the whole globe
Love y'all, nasty piece
