[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Snoop Dogg, PKZ
Check this out

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Raise up, real jeez
Tokyo to LBC
Money stacking hip, slapping
Put the city on their knees
Bow down to the west, bow down to the east
Bow down to the west, bow down to the east
Put these suckers on the knees
I'ma boss from the beach, off the least
I'ma beast, worldwide in the streets
Bow down in the presence of the d-o-double-g
Bow down in the presence of the P-K-Z
Bow down to the west, bow down to the east
Bow down to the west, bow down to the east
Bow down to the west, bow down to the east
Bow down in the presence of the d-o-double-g

[Verse 1: Crazyboy]
It's me from Tokyo, I'm a Crazyboy
Swash from Mercedes swish, Konichiwa
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my chest
Getting like a ninja

[Verse 2: Yultron, Crazyboy & Snoop Dogg]
[?] from the mansions
[?]
Maybe cause I'm like teens could pray, man yours irrelevant
Elevate, celebrate, on everyone else we never break
Hands up ninja
Now 冗談抜きで show down, bow down
Never slow down, just ball out
Help me shout out, [?] bow down (snoop dogg)
Bow down

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Raise up, real jeez
Tokyo to LBC
Money stacking hip, slapping
Put the city on their knees
Bow down to the west, bow down to the east
Bow down to the west, bow down to the east
Put these suckers on the knees
I'ma boss from the beach, of the least
I'ma beast, worldwide in the streets
Bow down in the presence of the d-o-double-g
Bow down in the presence of the P-K-Z
Bow down to the west, bow down to the east
Bow down to the west, bow down to the east
Bow down to the west, bow down to the east
Bow down to the west, bow down to the east
Bow down in the presence of the d-o-double-g

Bow down
Bow down
Bow down in the presence of the d-o-double-g
Bow down
Bow down
Bow down
Bow down in the presence of the d-o-double-g

Bow down to the west, bow down to the east
Bow down to the west, bow down to the east
Bow down to the west, bow down to the east
Bow down in the presence of the d-o-double-g
Bow down
Bow down
