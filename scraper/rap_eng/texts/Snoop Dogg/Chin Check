[snoop dogg]

[ice cube]
I'm a nigga wit an attitude thanks to y'all
And I don't give a f**k I keep it gangsta y'all
I'ma ride for my side in the c.p.t
God bless the memory of eazy-e
If it wadn't for me where the f**k you'd be?
Rappin like the treacherous three, f**kin cowards
I'd have seen dre rockin parties for hours
And I'd have seen ren f**kin bitches from howard
And I'd have seen snoop give away eddie bauer's
So f**k jerry heller and the white superpowers

[mc ren]
This the shit niggas kill for
They hear the villain niggas spittin' with them nigga flows
F**k you hoes, f**k you bitch ass niggas too
Got something for you broke
These niggas wearin' skirts like the pope
Who them niggas that you love to get (us)
Who them niggas that you f**kin' wit' (us)
Love the girl that weed and shit (what)
The saga continues, with the worlds most dangerous group
Four deep in the coup
(I'm a spill it)

[Chorus]
I'ma smoke where I wanna smoke (f**k that)
I'ma choke who I wanna choke (f**k that)
I'ma ride where I wanna ride (f**k that)
Cause i'ma nigga 4 life, so i'ma nigga til I diz-ie
(n n, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a)
I'ma smoke where I wanna smoke (f**k that)
I'ma choke who I wanna choke (f**k that)
(n n, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a)
I'ma ride where I wanna ride (f**k that)
Cause i'ma nigga 4 life, so i'ma motherf**kin nigga til I diz-ie

[dr dre]
A pencil, a pen, or a Glock
Im the original, subliminal, subterranium
Titianium, criminal minded, swift
D-r-e with that f**k a bitch shit (f**k a biatch)
A couple o' notes and get you hog-tied in rope
Dope like tons of coke, cutthroat
You don't want the pistols to whistle
Candy paint impala
I make hoes pop collars

[snoop dogg]
God damn hoes, here we go again
F**kin with ren, playin' to win
(he got the) coke in hand, (I got the) juice and gin
Same shit you was f**kin wit way back then
We keep it crackin' from the actin to the jackin
G'ed up c'ed up motherf**ker blaze the weed up
We all on deck fool so put your heat up
I stay on deck so me don't get wet

[ice cube]
Look my nigga, we can scatter like buckshots
Let's get together, make a record, why the f**k not?
[mc ren] why the f**k not?
[dr dre] why the f**k not?
[snoop dogg] why the f**k not?
[ice cube] cause I'm tight as the night
I had to wipe activator off the mic, in 1985

[snoop dogg]
(n n, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a)
Real niggas, biatch, you know, ha hah

[ice cube]
We cause tragedy, erratically
Systematically, in your house without a key
How f**ked up that'd be
Gat'll be near your anatomy, my form of flattery

[dr dre]
Assault and battery, cus we coming with that street mentality
Straight west coast rider academy
Concrete nigga, that's my reality
[snoop dogg] we tend to bus' on niggas that get mad at me
[dr dre] was it a bitch in the mix
[snoop dogg] well it had to be

[dr dre]
Lying tricks told them dicks I had a key
Hoes make the world harder than it have to be
(yea thats right)

[Chorus]
I'ma smoke where I wanna smoke (f**k that)
I'ma choke who I wanna choke (f**k that)
I'ma ride where I wanna ride (f**k that)
Cause i'ma nigga 4 life, so i'ma nigga til I diz-ie

I'ma smoke where I wanna smoke (f**k that)
I'ma choke who I wanna choke (f**k that)
I'ma ride where I wanna ride (f**k that)
Cause i'ma nigga 4 life, so i'ma motherf**kin nigga til I diz-ie
