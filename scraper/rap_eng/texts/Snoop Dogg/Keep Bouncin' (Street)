Got the hook-up on the birds and the motherfuckin zippers
Go to the club with my thugs sell drugs
And I might get a girl but I ain't gon' tip her (uh-uh)

[Too $hort]
Beotch! I told the DJ play her song
Watch her choose up, put a player on
Put her in the wifey zone
She can be my girlfriend all night long
Keep bouncin, the floor is sweatin
I'm all on her booty, I know I'm gettin it
We from the West coast, we live fun lives
Freak these hoes 'til the sunrise
What time is it, late night
Send her back home when it's daylight
Her nigga at the house with a cake like
Captain Save-a-Ho, but she ain't right
She like to play hard to get
She don't wanna dance she wants some hard dick
Well give her what she wants
Stick it in the ho, and watch her go dumb {DUMB}

I like breasts best when they poppin out
So girl bring 'em out, bring 'em out, I make 'em bounce
{"Keep, keep bouncing!"} Yeah just keep them bouncing
Open up your mind and accept what I'm announcing
If we have a President's Day and a Veteran's Day
Let's have a Titty Holiday
And lick on nipple everyday through the weekend
I like tit like fish like sippin
Watchin boobies bounce is my favorite tradition
When I'm up in the club just sittin and wishin
Them boobies was bouncin on my head (my head)

Bouncin, bouncin on my head (my head)
