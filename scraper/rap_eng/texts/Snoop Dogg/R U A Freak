[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hurry, hurry, write your number on the napkin right now
And if you feel it let me hear you say oh, cause I gotta go
Something's burning, you see the party people rocking side to side
And if you feel it let me hear you say oh, cause I gotta know

[Chorus]
She's DTF cause she's down to feel
That aromatic, now unlock it baby this is for real
Are you a freak, or what?
I'm just a squirrel tryna get a nut
You crack me up
Are you a freak? So am I
So could we see eye to eye?

[Verse 2]
You must let go of that mind control that's coming out your television and radio
You must escape (say what) escape from here
Get intelligent when you hit that shit and let it go (blow)
Far from here, let it go (just blow)
Let it go

[Chorus]
She's DTF cause she's down to feel
That aromatic, now unlock it baby this is for real
Are you a freak, or what?
I'm just a squirrel tryna get a nut
You crack me up
Are you a freak? So am I
So could we see eye to eye?

[Verse 3]
You try to survive, you're under pressure cause you're running outta time
But this is not a chance you wanna blow, cause we gotta go
The deal is murder, you think long, you've been wrong, get it out your mind
Make you move when you hear them screaming oh, cause I gotta go

[Chorus]
She's DTF cause she's down to feel
That aromatic, now unlock it baby this is for real
Are you a freak, or what?
I'm just a squirrel tryna get a nut
You crack me up
Are you a freak? So am I
So could we see eye to eye?

[Bridge]
Why don't you sway, sway side to side?
Dip, dip, glide and glide
Sway, sway side to side
Dip, dip, do it one more time
Why don't you sway, sway side to side?
Dip, dip, glide and glide
Sway, sway side to side
Dip, dip, baby let that ride
