[Hook]
Get ready for the next battle
I fade em
Run it
I fade em
I need that
I fade em
Run it
I knock em down
Run it homie
I knock em down
Run it homie
I knock em down
I need that
I knock em down x3
Run it homie
I knock em down

[Verse 1]
Iron fists like Tekken
Jump kick wood tips on you in a second
Ready for the battle, you can pick the weapons
God Fist combo, here comes the blessing
Smash on you pronto from all directions
Line the fade up, buttons get to pressing
Hit you with the fisticuffs, homie you're my next win
Get you powered up and come back for revenge
When I start checking chins
You won't last a couple seconds, busters gone in the wind
And Doggie does it again
Stepping yall, repping Dogg, tip toe wrecking, this is Tekken

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Put down the sticks, survival of the fit
You bout to get smashed on, probably get flicked
Probably get kicked, so you probably gonna lose, so you probably bout to quit
Riding Dogg, almost cut your braids off
Shock a number one and I still remain boss
2 and 0, homie, first round draft pick
Get your jaw broke, get laid down quick
You gotta have hands in this fighting tournament
So put it on thick
Press start to go, get punched in the lip
The winner keeps playing and the loser gets tipped
Sat him on his pockets, he outta here, that boy gone

[Hook]
