[Intro: Brotha Lynch Hung]
It's me and Snoop Dogg, Kurupt and Daz, nigga
(Another killing)
It's another motherfucking killing, nigga
It's another killing
We had to put this together (another killing)
Just had to be

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
They laid one of my homies down, two of my enemies
I grab the heat and creep up the street and squeeze
I'm in your neighborhood, so what the fuck is up?
And if I catch you I'mma pop you, nigga that's whats up!
We can talk about it, nah, I don't think so
And I'mma catch you when you're creeping with that pink toe
You tryna creep up out that mink store, get you a drink
So when I hit you, you won't even trip to think so
Cross your heart, double dot your eyes
Yellow tape you, make you a homicide
Stretch you out like a Red Vine
Halloween is your deadline, beddy bed time
I zag your zig, I put a fork in the pig
I cock the Glock and pop you my nigga, you dig?
I open you up and leave you leaking by the face
In ghetto we ain't got no time to be catching no case
Too slick, too sly, plus I'm too high
I'm too fly and I do die, I do die
I love to shoot an intruder, I mix the purp with the budda
Love Chicken and Beer like the homeboy Luda
Big Snoopy D-O-Dub, I'mma killa cuz
I'm draped up like a steela of gorilla (dub)
Sacramento no, pedal to the floor
Anotha killing for realer, my nigga let it go

[Verse 2: Daz]
We on the corner a hundred (deep), blue rag the fuck up
And word on the street they got blast the fuck up
Now it's feuding and shooting and I'm running your life
I'm in it for the stripes, nigga don't fuck up my night
Bandana, banana-clips, ready to trip
You niggas is assed out, see you bet' not trip
I see some buster ass niggas at the bus stop out of bound
We bang the gang bang them niggas from The Dogg Pound
Chop 'em, rock 'em and stop 'em, we mashing
Everytime we see you niggas we clashing
D.P.G down with 24th Street
Siccmade nigga down with them 21st g's
(Motherfucker) Brotha Lynch Hung my motherfucking nigga

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Listen to me
One for the flame, and two for the trigga
And three of these hollow point teflons nigga
When I came in this motherfucker I had a plan
I'll sock all you motherfuckers where y'all stand
I'm gang banged out, riders on a mission
We can catch fades, nigga fuck the pistols
Piranhas is loose in the septic tank
We do what you can't, I am what you ain't
Don't even try to provoke me cuz
Loccing, smoking, slipping, smoke me cuz
I'll beat your ass on the low so fast
Bang on your homies, spread through your hood
Release these toxins like mustard gas
Scrape the Chevrolet, it's all to the good
My nigga Brotha Lynch, Kurupt, Snoop and Daz
(Keep it hood, nigga)

[Verse 4: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Nigga this G block, trust me
Dump on any nigga with the rusty old trusty
Sacramento yes, catch him in the chest
Right by his tour bus left a bloody mess, yes
It was none a cuddy left
Coathanga strangled him, aimed at him
He don't know what angle I'm coming from
Tangled him, spiderwebs all over his cranium
(That nigga has spiderwebs all over his cranium, nigga)
Me and Crooked I know, niggas be talking too much
Nigga shut your pie hole, everybody know you do suck
This ain't a reality show, hungry niggas do touch
Mothafuckas two clutch, giving niggas who cuss
Got an army of niggas, I'm Strange, it ain't a rumor
We giving niggas brain tumors, hit 'em with the Luger
I'm doing the rapping and this nigga is the shooter
'Yay got a mask on but nigga he's a shooter
You'll never see his face on a computer
Spiderman Jr. Oklahoma chewmer
Poke a ho with two cuts
This motherfucker said he about to do what?
Get chewed up, it's Dinner and a Mova'
Deuce-Four, nigga
