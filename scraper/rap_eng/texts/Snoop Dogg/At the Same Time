Mr. Magnolia, the high roller, knew I'd pull him over
And bless him with a fat sack of some dolja, told ya
See I'm a soldier represtin' West Coast, cuz
But South Side, rip ride, go on and give it up
I can't fake it, for all my niggas moving weight
From state to state, get your mothafuckin' paper plates
And stack that shit nigga, go on and get your grip on
I'm in it to win it for No Limit (for life)
So nigga trip on (thats right)
And dip on , cause we gon' keep makin' hits (makin' hits)
And the kinda music, that makes you wanna bust a bitch (b-i-atch)

Then P sat me down, hooked me up (uhh) and strapped me down
With the rowdy rowdy (rowdy rowdy) bout it bout it
Suicide, pull a ride, nutty buddy, with the cutty on the side
Sittin' on, 3's with D's, on top of dub
I'm down South in the club gettin' much love (nigga, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now a thing about me and young cuz
We hit No Limit at the same time (nigga, what, what, what, what?)
