[Spoken Intro]
Hey blacken this motherfucker out
Death Row
Turn all these lights out
Turn all these lights the fuck off

Yeah!
What up!

[Verse 1]
As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they break in trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
(I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby)
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
But how long will I live? (Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
Sing that shit!

[Chorus]
Murder was the case
Murder was the case
Murder was the case (C'mon)
Murder, murder, murder was the case
Murder was the case (C'mon)
Murder was the case (C'mon)
Murder was the case (C'mon)
Murder, murder, murder was the case
Murder was the case
Murder was the case
Murder was the case
Murder was the case
Murder was the case
Murder was the case
Murder was the case
Murder was the case

[Verse 2]
I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and Tha Doggpound in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
I'm living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz (And bought my boo boo a Jag)
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rag
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine, nigga)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some mo'
New York, check it out

[Bridge]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
(Murder was the case)
If I should die, before I wake
(Murder was the case)
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

Now let me hear you say "187!"
(187!)
Say "187!"
(187!)
Say "187!"
(187!)
Say "187"
(187!)

[Verse 3]
No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
I'm mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on Tha pound
I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

[Outro]
Murder was the case
Murder was the case
Murder was the, murder was the, murder was the case
Say "187!"
(187!)
Say "187!"
(187!)
Say "187"
(187!)
