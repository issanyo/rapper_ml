Fuck
You know a nigga don't wanna go to school today
Let me call this bitch, and get my shit together

[Chorus]
When I pull up people so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us

Uh, this one's for the G's, all black chucks on the cuffs of my jeans
King size papes stuffed full of trees
I be with the boss dog, y'all fuck niggas fleas
Now they say I'm hot hundred something degrees
Taking pictures with a young nigga, cheese
Remember days homie, I ain't have a thing
Now I'm hoping off a plane putting roaches on the wing
And my hoes like queens, but we smoke like kings
Jewelry froze like bling
Money comes fast yours slow like ?
Rolling up grass, so weed to have to style, so I know I'm gonna pass
Third period, showing up last
With a late note blowin' green smoke

[Chorus]
We blow to the middle of the day
Wiz say Dogg put the middle of the jay
Hey, why not? Not why?
We fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high
Fuck it, everybody to the library
Got a new batch, some blue, booberry
Stuck in the hallway, with a pass, say dog he just smoke all day
It's a mind game, like the ream I seem to keep migraines
Richie Valens ?
I'm so lifted, like a parachuter
My grass day off day off like Ferris Bueller
Slip away, dip away, almost had to throw a wholezip away
But fuck that, this the Taylor gang, what you on dog
Shit I'm on everythang

[Chorus]
Never have never will
You niggas never have never will
You niggas never have never will
I said you niggas never have and you never will
You niggas never have and never will
You niggas never have and never will
Big Snoop and young Wiz smokin' kill kill kill kill
You niggers still in junior high-school, elementary ass niggas
Holler at me when you graduate
We'll be posted right by the four hundred building
Room four twenty, follow your nose

[Chorus]
