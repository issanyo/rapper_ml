[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings]
I got this old school the color of soul food
Candy yam racing stripes, pipes potato white
Cornbread interior trimmed in collard greens
Air freshener smell like chicken and pork and beans
See I got this old school the color of soul food
Candy yam racing stripes, pipes potato white
Cornbread interior trimmed in collard greens
Air freshener smell like chicken and pork and beans

[Verse 1: Lyfe Jennings]
I work the graveyard shift cause I'm dead on my feet ya'll
Really wanna quit, but the kids gotta eat ya'll
See money can't buy you power, but it can pay the water bill on time, so them kids can take a shower, and I swear to God
If they keep on raising the gas price I'ma sell this Chevy and go buy me a bike
I'ma king, but my crown's in the layaway and I'm just a day away from giving up

[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings]
I got this old school the color of soul food
Candy yam racing stripes, pipes potato white
Cornbread interior trimmed in collard greens
Air freshener smell like chicken and pork and beans
See I got this old school the color of soul food
Candy yam racing stripes, pipes potato white
Cornbread interior trimmed in collard greens
Air freshener smell like chicken and pork and beans

[Verse 2: Lyfe Jennings]
Credit card company called said my bill is overdue
Told 'em I can't afford to pay them and rent too
They told me they were gonna sue me
I said if you didn't want me to use it, then you shouldn't have gave it to me
And what's up with these people blowing up buildings
Ain't nothing really gangsta about blowing up children
Would cry, but my eyes in the layaway and I'm just a day away from giving up

[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings]
I got this old school the color of soul food
Candy yam racing stripes, pipes potato white
Cornbread interior trimmed in collard greens
Air freshener smell like chicken and pork and beans
See I got this old school the color of soul food
Candy yam racing stripes, pipes potato white
Cornbread interior trimmed in collard greens
Air freshener smell like chicken and pork and beans

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Foreign places, court cases, seems they always on my line
I don't trip I just dip, pop the top on my '69
Fleetwood Cadillac, mirror with my boys on back
Chandelier so superior, Louis Vuitton oatmeal interior, bossy boss mink seats, what it cost speak yo piece
Can't you see ain't no big deal have a seat lil' homie enjoy your meal
Close the door and don't drop crumbs on my flow, here we go soul food so cool, and I got this

[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings]
I got this old school the color of soul food
Candy yam racing stripes, pipes potato white
Cornbread interior trimmed in collard greens
Air freshener smell like chicken and pork and beans
See I got this old school the color of soul food
Candy yam racing stripes, pipes potato white
Cornbread interior trimmed in collard greens
Air freshener smell like chicken and pork and beans

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, Lyfe, Big Snoop, soul food, oh I got this greenery cause we need some vegetables too, gotta have your vegetables, that's what it is, old school soul food, old school soul food
