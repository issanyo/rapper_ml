[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Alyssa Reid
Big snoop dog
This game is cold
Ya dig?

[Chorus: Alyssa Reid]
Everywhere I go
And everyone who knows me
Knows that I would stand alone
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game

[Verse 1: Alyssa Reid]
We wanna roll baby
Maybe more maybe
I gave it everything, we never swing it harder
The farther I saw the room was spinning
Higher a cloud was nearing my name heard him cheer it
And the body started dropping soon as I dropped my lyric

[Pre-Chorus: Alyssa Reid]
Fake it till I make it
And you try to break it
Now you try to take it back
But you know that
I've been doing my thing
I've been running my game
And you know I won't look back
You know that...

[Chorus: Alyssa Reid]
Everywhere I go
And everyone who knows me
Knows that I would stand alone
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game
I'm standing on my toes
To the sky I go
And you know you're the one to think
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game
We all play it the same

[Verse 2: Alyssa Reid]
I don't wanna be vindictive addic-addict addictive
But if you curse, I'll conspire my verses
Yhey will spit fire at ya
Trash me; sample my lyrics, think I won't hear it
You career's in Disney Land
Did you say something? Pardon? Don't hear it

[Pre-Chorus: Alyssa Reid]
Stronger cause you made me
You will never faze me
You can never take me down
Cause you know that
I've been doing my thing
I've been running my game
And you know I won't look back
You know that...

[Chorus: Alyssa Reid]
Everywhere I go
And everyone who knows me
Knows that I would stand alone
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game
I'm standing on my toes
To the sky I go
And you know you're the one to think
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game
We all play it the same

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, the game
I ball like a bawlker
Like jeez, every day, ya dig?
My prerogative, so I'm living positive
Blind shine like a study
You don't really want it
Pull a three in your face, cold blooded
[?], make believe, or for real a laker and a baker
Hell ya like a yeller; he's a sinner
And it's all how I get down to it
It's all part of the game
I thought you knew it

[Chorus: Alyssa Reid]
Everywhere I go
And everyone who knows me
Knows that I would stand alone
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game
I'm standing on my toes
To the sky I go
And you know you're the one to think
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game

[Outro: Alyssa Reid]
We all play it the same
(play it the same, the game, the game)
We all play it the same
(play it the same, the game, the game)
It's all part of the game
