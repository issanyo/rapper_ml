[Snoop Dogg]
What's crack-a-lackin’? It's ya boy Bigg Snoop Dogg and you do know what I'm about to do right now
Snoop Dogg Presents The West Coast Blueprint
Brought to you on behalf of Priority Records
Yeah we bringin’ it back to life again, 25 years of great music back to life
Turnin' the light back on in the building, you understand what I'm sayin'?
My priority is the West Coast, if you don't know, you won't know
And what we gon' do right here, we just gon' take it right back to the beginning of this West Coast, you know this Hip Hop thang what it started on, what it was built on, what it was based on
And I got music to go from era to era, from city to city, MC to MC
And kickin’ it off, I’ve gotta do it this way
My OG, your OG, Eazy-E from the city of Compton, 1988, "Eazy-Duz-It"
What was you doin' when this record came out?
I was goin’ to Jordan cause they kicked me out of Poly
So you know what it is, let's check it out real quick
Eazy-E, "Eazy-Duz-It" on this Snoop Dogg Presents The West Coast Blueprint
