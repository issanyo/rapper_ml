[Verse 1: 2pac]
I'm livin rough and raw
Catchin cases at a fast rate, ballin in the fast lane
Hustle till the mornin, never stop until the cash came
Was hyper as a kid
Cold as a teenager
On my mobile callin big shots on the scene major
I bet you got it twisted you don't know who to trust
So many playa-hatin niggas tryin to sound like us
Nigga then we first to bomb, bust on these bitch-made niggas
Hit em up, Westside!
Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger, lord forgive me if I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, no fuckin from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California's where I'm at - right?
Passed by while these niggas wonder why I got shot but didn't die Let em see who's next to try
Did I cry?, hell nah, nigga tear I shed
For all my homies in the pen, many peers dead
Niggas still ballin

[Hook 1: 2pac]
Still ballin, till the day I die
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, till the day I die
You can bring your crew but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle
Just to feed all my people
Lyrically, I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga
Y'all spit saliva, and I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this ho, if you scared to go
I keep it gangsta
And why should I change that?
Fuck you old mothafuckas tryin to change rap
But ain't you the same cat
That sat back when they brought cocaine back?
I'm tryna get me a Maybach
How you mothafuckas gonna tell me "don't say that"?
You the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971

[Hook 2: Ice Cube]
I can say what I wanna say
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal
Ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Click, click, boom, just as soon as we hit the room
You can hear em holla "Goon Squad!" in this bitch
Let me hear you holla "Goon Squad!" in this bitch
Let me hear you holla "Runyon Ave!" in this bitch
So who am I gonna call on when I ain't got them boys with me
And the situation gets a little sticky?
Imma dial 911 like a mothafuckin punk
Fuck that, blah blah, Imma call that rude boy from Detroit
Trick, trick, quick come pick me up!
Bring them guns, come to the club, meet me out front
There's some chump up in this bitch
Poppin some junk, cause he's drunk
And we may have to fuck his ass up, cause uh, somethin smells a lil fishy
And I don't like the way his boys keep lookin at me
So homie, come get me
Wonder Boys what up tho, I see you, rock bottom yeah I see you
Detroit motherfuckers till we die

[Hook 3: 2pac]
Still ballin, till the day I die
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, till the day I die
You can bring your crew but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
Now everything's good in my hood
And it's on and poppin, Eazy-mothaphukkin-E from east side south Compton
Straight givin up the real
On how a nigga feel
Talk that shit, motherfuckers' caps get peeled
Layin low in the cut
Gettin high than the mothafucka, niggas know what's up
I'm that gangsta-gangsta, is that what they're still yellin?
Nigga G to a T, saggin and bailin
Live by the gun, you know what I'm sayin Ren?
So I guess I'll die by that motherfucker then
So when I die, niggas bury me
Make sure my shit reads "Eazy-mothaphukkin-E"
And it's a fact
To be exact, my tombstone should read "He put Compton on that map"
And that's how a nigga feel
When I'm givin up the motherfuckin real

[Refrain: 2pac and Eazy-E]
(2Pac: Ballin in the fast lane, the fast lane!)
(Eazy-E: The motherfuckin real, real, shots goin out to the hardcore hip hop)
(2pac: Hustle till the mornin)
(Eazy-E: The motherfuckin real, real, real, real... Buckin these niggas till they drop)
(2pac: Bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many playa-hatin niggas tryin to sound like us
Ballin in the fast lane
Nigga then we first to bomb, bust on these bitch-made niggas
Hit em up, Westside!)

[Verse 5: MC Ren]
Well it be the real niggas back with that hard street shit
Bitch niggas be pissin a fit, but I say fuck em when I buck em
It's that nigga with the cool and mellow shit for your ass
Takin niggas back through the past
All up on my nuts, shit be swingin like a fist
Can't even take a piss, if I did niggas would cut they wrist
In a motherfuckin candy 4, beat that ass with the switch
Then blast, on the bitch who was all in my shit
It's that nigga Ren back for the '9-5
They say real niggas was dead but this nigga be alive, so I'm, puttin it down with that nigga E
For all of my niggas in the C-P-T
So here we go again with part 3 of the script, makin bitch-made niggas bite they lip when we dip
So tell me how the fuck do it feel
To get hit with the motherfuckin real?

[Hook 4: 2pac]
Still ballin, till the day I die
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, till the day I die
You can bring your crew but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin

[Verse 6: Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin screw up
Got introduced to the game, got an ounce and fuckin blew up
Choppin rocks over night
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police, picture that
Nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight, laid back
I got some money to make motherfucker

[Pre-Hook: 2pac]
Did I cry? hell nah, nigga tear I shed
For all my homies in the pen, many peers dead
Nigga still ballin

[Hook 5: Ice Cube]
I can say what I want to say
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal
Ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

[Verse 7: Snoop Dogg]
High speed chase, 405 is the freeway
Swangin my, bangin my, swangin my Coupe Deville
Scoop! DeVille, like that, right back
Top for the hill
Wheel in my hand with a trunk full of contraband
Swimmin underwater like I'm Aqua Man
I used to drink gin, now it's vodka man
Boss Dawg is the baller, no propagand
Pop yo band, don't try and stop the plan
Rocky land, step back and pop yo man
Spaced out, caked out, no bug a boo
Flipped out, cripped out, nigga what it really do?
Time brings change so I changed my name
Tryna take flight while they clippin my wings
Groupie ass niggas see ya chippin the game
With nothin to gain, plop, plop, pop and I bang

[Hook 6: Ice Cube]
If I sell a little crack
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet
Ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
