[Chorus]
Sho you wrong, sho you right
You ain’t sum’ wrong
Think you just the kind I like
Sho you wrong, sho you right
I wanna freak with you till the morning light
Sho you wrong, sho you right
Up and down, round and round (yeah)
Sho me wrong, sho you right
Baby, won’t you come with me
And we gon’ have a party tonight

[Verse 1]
You’re so dedicated, and elated, celebrated
Been through so much, so much
But yet we made it
You’re so bad, you’re so fly
And I know why
You blow my mind
You’re one of a kind
You’re more than a dime
You’re fine

[Chorus]
Sho you wrong, sho you right
You ain’t sum’ wrong
Think you just the kind I like
Sho you wrong, sho you right
I wanna freak with you till the morning light
Sho you wrong, sho you right
Up and down, round and round
Sho me wrong, sho you right
Baby, won’t you come with me
And we gon’ have a party tonight

Up and down, round and round you go
And we gon’ have a party tonight
Up and down, round and round you go
And we gon’ have a party tonight
