[Intro]
Cruising down the street in my 6 4 (my town)
Jocking the-, slapping a-
Went to the park- to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there, cold, shooting s-
Cruising down the street in my 6 4, jocking a-, jocking a-
Cruising down the street in my 6 4, jocking a-, jocking a-

[Chorus]
Cruising down the street in my 6 4, jocking a-, jocking a-
Cruising down the street in my- (my town, town, town)

[Verse 1 : Mike Jones]
Well I'm cruising down the street in my candy painted low (low)
Bouncing like a door, with 4 on my 6 4's
I pull up wood gripping, doors tipping sitting low
I'm hitting sixteen switches watch it stop and hit the floor
I'm leaning on the curb sipping syrup blowing dro
The girls show me love when they panties hit the floor
I said I'm leaning on the curb sipping syrup blowing dro
I got the 6 4 hopping, watch it stop and do a show

[Bridge : Mike Jones]
First I lean wit it, then I rock wit it
I got a candy apple drop wit a Glock in it
First I lean wit it, then I rock wit it
I got a candy apple drop wit a Glock in it

[Hook : Mike Jones]
First I lean, then I rock, (Mike Jones)
First I lean, then I rock, (I said)
First I lean wit it, then I rock wit it
I got a candy apple drop wit a Glock in it
(Because I'm)

[Chorus]
Cruising down the street in my 6 4, jocking a-, jocking a-
Cruising down the street in my 6 4, jocking a-, jocking a-
Cruising down the street in my 6 4, jocking a-, jocking a-
Cruising down the street in my-

[Verse 2 : Snoop Dogg]
Big Snoop Dogg with a yellow paris hiny
With two girlies in the back in they Crip blue bikinis
Shaking and they jumping cause the deuce keep bouncing
Tipping, whipping, tha ass, steady dipping
Candy paint dripping and these axles want a sipping
As I shake like a dice game
Cold as the ice age
Mike Jones rocking like a rolling stone
It's Snoop Dogg boy I'm B-B-Bad to the bone
Yeag them Cali boys
We love them low lows
An real car club niggas bang they low doors
And take four tows
See everything is fine
I'm in the 64
A 60 trail a 59
I love my car
Like I love my wife
See low riding ain't a sport
It's a way of life
On the real dough I'll tell you how it feel though
If you see me in the for creeping slow yo

[Chorus]
Cruising down the street in my 6 4, jocking a-, jocking a-
Cruising down the street in my 6 4, jocking a-, jocking a-
Cruising down the street in my 6 4, jocking a-, jocking a-
Cruising down the str-
