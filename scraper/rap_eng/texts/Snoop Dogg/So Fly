One day I heard somebody say if it's good to ya
Then it must be good for ya, but bullshit
Cause niggas shrinkin', gettin' skinny than a motherfucker
I bumped my head, when I shoulda been dead
When I was mislead, and I like it...
Okay! Man y'all better quit lyin' to y'all girl
You'll be surprised what she'll do for you man cause that's y'all world
And she can help you do it better if you sit down and talk
And we all know that shit be soundin' like
"womp-womp-womp-womp"
But if you sincere about what's comin' out your mouth
And you tellin' her ass what this game is about
Man she'll run for you, and everytime you wake up
And get G'd up and brushed up, this bitch wanna run for you
But you know what's so sad?
Way over half of y'all niggas will never get a chance to experience that
You think she chillin' with her friend again?
Man she walkin' down the street so she can make me some ends
I keep my nails done, I speak well, I'm watchin' my cholesterol
I live on a body of water, enjoy drinkin' alcohol

So fly, and I like it
Badda ba ba ba, badda ba ba ba
So fly, and I like it

[Snoop Dogg]
Bo$$ Dogg got mass appeal, sellin' everything
From pussy to George Foreman barbeque grills (Yes you do!)
Hey Suga Free can I light that? (Go on Dogg)
Hold on cuz, I'll C right back
I take a trip to the flip Rip side where the sun shine
Catch a plane to Spain, it's all for a boat ride
Of course I'm so fly, know why
In a suit and bowtie, bitch I'm Blowfly
(Rap dirty) I got 'em lined up to get on my team
They tryin' to figure out where they get signed up
Yeah my game is top-notch
They've been buyin' this shit, since the days of hop scotch
It's like I'm reachin' through the wire
Nowadays I feel I'm preachin' to the choir (chuuch)
Y'all think that money grow on trees?
Pullin' on my branches, rollin' up my leaves?

[Hook]
So fly, and I like it
Badda ba ba ba, badda ba ba ba
So fly, and I like it
Badda ba ba ba, badda ba ba ba

[Suga Free]
And yeah we know a lot of y'all be thinkin' pimps be soft
But for us she payin', and for y'all she cost
So if you on my Cadillac and see some polish remover
It ain't my mama's partna it's mine, now get outta line
You see this hanger boy? I can untie this little piece of metal so fast
It'll make her lower her motherfuckin' voice
Cause you ain't payin' nobody bitch, you ain't nobody bitch
And you don't know nobody bitch, you don't make nobody rich
But you hatin' on me, hopin' Suga Free gon' crash
When I got pimpin' written all up and down my ass
I can dance a dance, step until I'm ready to go
Just like my mama or G-Wayne or George Jefferson ho
You see this nail file, nigga don't laugh at that
The letter P's the only letter in the alphabet
I'm kinky like my fro that's why she scratches my back
I cut my nails everytime I pull her hair like that

So fly, and I like it
