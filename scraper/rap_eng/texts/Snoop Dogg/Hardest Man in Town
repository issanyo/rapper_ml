Will the hardest man please stand?
The homie stood right up
Saggin' pants, gat in hand
The nigga was a nut
Looney low key, O.G
Been bangin' from the jump
Dressed in all black, ready to jack
And he still don't give a fuck
A friend of mine he used to be
Before I got caught up
He used to roll with me, way back in '93
When I was broke as fuck
Be prepared to blast, that's all that he ask
If he's to ride with you
We gonna make some cash and dash
You can toss him when ya through
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man around
Little big man, don't you see me lyin' here?
Pick me up if you dare
I'll make your life easier
'Cause I'll be pumpin' fear
Disrespect, you don't have to take
If you see him comin' just wave me in his face
But you ain't the only one
That got a friend like me
So hurry up, let's go
I'm kind of tired of being broke
I know you gotta get paid
I can show you the way
So take me home, polish the chrome
Load me up and put me to his dome
I got a lot work to do
So toss me and be gone
You're a big man now
You're a big man now
You're a big man now
You're a big man now
I told you once before
I'm pumpin' fear
Nobody's gonna step to you'
Let them know I'm here
And if you have questions
In the corner of your mind
Pull the trigger
And leave your questions behind
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man around
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man around
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man around
