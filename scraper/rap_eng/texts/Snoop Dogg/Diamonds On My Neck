Diamonds on my neck, hanging with my people
Strictly for the set, this is for them D-boys
Diamonds on my neck, hanging with my people
Strictly for the set, this is for them D-boys
Diamonds on my neck, this is for them D-boys
Diamonds on my neck, this is for them D-boys
Diamonds on my neck, this is for them D-boys
Diamonds on my neck, this is strictly for them D-boys

[Verse 1: DeSean Jackson]
I got them diamonds on my neck and it's straight for my D-boys
I ride around with that eagle but it's ten, don't know fever
The ice cold receiver got them money banks like I'm freezing
Them cold nights and them sunny days, that Jaccpot movement got me buzzing
Cause I'm paid and my money straight, west coast first but I've been ablaze
Yeah, that young boy on the go, that money stupid, that's the overflow

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Came up in the black peak, car with the top off
Had to make a drop off, roll up the trees and fill up the bag
Now I got a white bitch that I knock from young bud
Slither in the mic booth, straight got my dick sucked
All I make is big bucks cause I am the big dog
Run it and high, tone it and I'm wanted for crimes, one of a kind
Four, four, four, four, four, four, three, three, two, one
I am who you get it from even if you think not
Three point bank shot, neff what you smoking on
Girl, who you holler at? I be on the dope spot
Where they getting dollars at, yeah, all my D-boys be in my seat, boy
This is how we get it, get it, real niggas fucking with it
With a chest full of chains and I'm fucking with this jackpot
Man, we doing big things

[Hook]

Diamonds on my neck strictly for the set
Diamonds on my neck strictly for the set
Diamonds on my neck
