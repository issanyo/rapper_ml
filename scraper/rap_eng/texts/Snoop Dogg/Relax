C-O-S-S-O-M

Like this...Hold up, she got the blue dress fittin' (fittin')
She got her hair hangin down (hangin down)
Lil mama know that she can get iitttt (get it)
I gotta knock her down (I gotta knock her down)
In the club spillin henny (hennny)
Got a whole bunch of bottles goin round (Yeaah)
A few shots now baby actin silly (So silllly)
She beggin me to take her dowwwn (And Imma do it)

And I was like Ooww, she said oowww
We could hurry outta here
And head straight to my hoouuuse
Go on finish up your drink
And stop runnin your mouth
Tell your girls see ya later
We about to be out

Bridge:
Like oowww, baby what you about
Once I get ya to the crib
Imma make you say aaaah
Head straight to the bed
Go on baby lay dowwn
By now you should know that I ain't playin around (Yep!)

Chorus:
I'm tryin to turn you inside out
All I gotta do is get you all alone
I'm just tryin to get you to...Relaaax...Relaaax!
I got a place where we can hide out
Maybe then baby you can get up in your zuuunee
I'm just tryin to get you to...Relaaax...Relaaax!

We at the back door, let's go grab your purse get your phone
You ain't gotta ask no questions like where we gon go
Stop, leave it, no let's go no baby now
No baby now let's go but can we stop fightin
Even though I know it's gettin you excited
Girl if you feel anything you ain't gotta hide it
You'll get a chance to show it all before the night ends

I'm in her ear talkin' about how I put it dowwn
She said howw, you know I like it slow cuz I'm from down souuth
I asked her was it cool, and she told me no douubt
Now I'm speedin in my car tryin' to pick the best rouute

Bridge:
Like oowww, baby what you about
Once I get ya to the crib
Imma make you say aaaah
Head straight to the bed
Go on baby lay dowwn
By now you should know that I ain't playin around (Yep!)

Yeaah, Yeaah

Chorus:
I'm tryin to turn you inside out

All I gotta do is get you all alone
I'm just tryin to get you to...Relaaax...Relaaax!
I got a place where we can hide out
Maybe then baby you can get up in your zuuunee
I'm just tryin to get you to...Relaaax...Relaaax!

SNOOP DOGG's Verse

Come on baby let me talk to ya for a minute..

Baby take your seat
Damn you feel soft
I'm get you backrub
Kick them heels off
You wid the doggie dogg
I'm so prepared
The kitchen's to the right
The bed is over der
Let me see you move
Go what body do
Under snoopie lights
I'm so proud of you
The way you break it down
N how u bring it up
????????????????
Go and drink it up
Imma light it up
Purple in the air
She say turn around
And look she in the underwear
Hey mummy super thick
That's how a dog do
Cuz if i want her skinny
I wouldn't have called you
Now lay your body down
Doggy Doggies back around
Just like you like it now
Beat it till i knock it down
Rip it , dip it, flip it
Till i smack it down
We can slide up
Straight to the hot out

Now just relaaax pretty girl
Come into my world
I'll take good care of you ain't nothin to worry about (Nooo)
Girl let me show you what you been missin'
Come close, I don't like a lot of distaance
First we'll start off touchin and kissin'
Tell me what you want I know how to listen
And I'll..make sure that you don't need nothin'
You'll be satisfiiiedd (Whoa)

Chorus:
I'm tryin to turn you inside out
All I gotta do is get you all alone
I'm just tryin to get you to...Relaaax...Relaaax!
I got a place where we can hide out
Maybe then baby you can get up in your zuuunee
I'm just tryin to get you to...Relaaax...Relaaax!
