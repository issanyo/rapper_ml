[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Nigga I tell the bitch quit
Sit down, shut up and floss my shit
My music gone, all that talkin' ain't it
So sit down, shut up and roll my shit
Now smoke with me, hook up my funk with me
Now take this money and hold this up for me
Now let it soak for me
Now bitch is you ready?
I gots to get it, I got, gots to get it

[Verse 1: The Game]
When I wake up in the morning sometimes I feel like goin' back to sleep
But I gotta keep this product on the street
Tryna take over my turf
Stretch me out in a hearse cause that is what it's worth
Baby momma keeps sweatin' it nigga, cause the rent's due
Ton son's, daughter on the way, I think I'm Fixed too
Get out on the streets stack the money like bill Gates
And do whatever it takes to keep my family straight
Livin' in Compton, some say it's suicide
Crossin' the street and catch a bullet from a drive by
My homie Dan's got it sippin' on a s√©ance
So many dead homies
When I hear about it I can't cry
I lost my grandmother, that's when I flipped
Only decision to make now, blood or a crip
Drove across the tracks, opened up the door on my Lac
Put the dope in the front, hop in the back
It was like that

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Nigga I tell the bitch quit
Sit down, shut up and floss my shit
My musics on, all that talkin' ain't it
So sit down, shut up and roll my shit
Now smoke with me, hook up my funk with me
Now take this money and hold this up for me
Now let it soak for me
Now bitch is you ready?
I gots to get it, I got, gots to get it

[Verse 2: The Game]
Throw on some clothes, grab the 4 and hit the back door
Hop the back gate and meet the fiends by the liquor store
Cops drop by, lookin' at us like we stole somethin'
They hit the brakes, that's when everybody starts runnin'
8 ball in my sock, sprintin down the block
Cut through the projects and that's when I threw the Glock
God damn it felt good to be home free
The city don't sleep, right next to Long Beach
Hard to survive in this motherfuckin' jungle
Runnin' with the wrong niggas, that will take you under
That's what happened to my nigga Big Wheel
Trusted the wrong bitch, that's what got his ass killed
A blunt and some Hennessey, a lot of good memories
How do you survive when everybody's your enemy?
Before you brush your teeth grab your strap
Cause niggas will pull the jack and bitches will peel you cap
Believe that

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Nigga I tell the bitch quit
Sit down, shut up and floss my shit
My music gone, all that talkin' ain't it
So sit down, shut up and roll my shit
Now smoke with me, hook up my funk with me
Now take this money and hold this up for me
Now let it soak for me
Now bitch is you ready?
I gots to get it, I got, gots to get it

[Verse 3: The Game]
Ain't nothin' better than a down ass bitch
When you're locked up in the pen and she sellin' you neck and flicks
On the tear, reminiscin' like a mother
Two strikes on the case file, locked up state
Now tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to be a father to my kids?
Son gang bangin' cause his daddy doin' nine years
And that happens in every hood in America
Shoot your own brother up and wonder why they scared of ya
And your momma at home without a back bone
Your girl gettin' tired of waitin' so she get her back blown
By your homie, that used to be your man
And you can't do shit cause you're sittin' in the can
And when you get out, you'll probly go and kill this nig
On the third strike, man the jury 'bout to kill this nigga
That's why I don't trust a nigga or a bitch
Cause either way a nigga always ends up caught up in some shit

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Nigga I tell the bitch quit
Sit down, shut up and floss my shit
My music gone, all that talkin' ain't it
So sit down, shut up and roll my shit
Now smoke with me, hook up my folk with me
Now take this money and hold this up for me
Now let it soak for me
Now bitch is you ready?
I gots to get it, I got, gots to get it

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yea
Game recognize game, nephew
See, when a bitch with me she know if to talk
She gon sit down, shut the fuck up and roll motherfuckin' weed
Talkin' is not an issue, you understand me?
Bitch, you do as I say
When I tell you to talk, you talk and I ain't told you to talk so shut the fuck up
You hear me?
Real pimp shit nigga
West Coast
We stay keepin' our hoes in check
Hey, that's your own problem man
Bitches takin' your all equip, runnin' you niggas crazy
Got niggas wanna kill like yourself
Man, fuck a bitch man
I grab a bitch, same dizzle and wizzle
You understand me?
I keep bitches like I keep weed
I got blueberry, AK-47, trainwreck
Whatever you need, ya dig?
That's it
