Lemme get this money together real quick like, what to do?
Big Snoop D.O. double G with the home girl, Lumidee
And we in it for the money, in it for the money
Hey, cheese
I wake up every morning gotta get it 'cause
I'm addicted to money 'cause, see, money is like a drug
It's the root of all evil, my people told me what it does
If you stick to it, get to it, do it now, live it up
Been in the hood since Job Noby stopped me
Talkin' 'bout what they heard how they got me
Man, listen, look, I came in the game
With the same dudes now throwin' dirt on my name
But it ain't nothin' to a girl like me
Love me or hate me I'ma still do me
And I've been through the ups and the downs
And no matter what they say, look, the girl's still around
I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny
They got me turning off the radio
Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no
I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny
They got me turning off the radio
Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no
Don't get it twisted and don't even try to knock me
'Cause I ain't one to ever be cocky
Man, listen, look, I came in the game
Broke and naive but a lot of shit changed
Yes, I've learned how to play it, I can show and prove
And if you ain't makin' money you ain't makin' moves
Yes, I have been through the ups and the downs
Wait, you're gettin' phased 'cause I'm goin' all rounds
I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny
They got me turning off the radio
Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no
I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny
They got me turning off the radio
Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no
Up to the ceiling, I'm feelin' like a million away from two billion
And I ain't stopped dealin', but am still in the game, still hearin' my name
Half a million dollar car, quarter million dollar chain
Money, and I'll tell you tonight
Money changes your life from a butter to a steak knife
Used to take life for granted
Now am known as one of the richest rappers
In the whole motherfuckin' planet
Ya dig it, I'm in it for the money
I make it rain, I let it snow
That twenty plus seven more zeros
Add it up, ya livin' wrong, better get right
Stop being broke and get ya monies tight
I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny
They got me turning off the radio
Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no
For the money, I'm in it for the money
Ain't no joke, I know you're tired bein' broke
It's for the money, it's only for the money
Never see me smilin', any things damn funny
It's for the money, it's only for the money
He wants the fame and she wants the honey, yeah
It's for the money, it's only for the money
Me and Lumidee, shit, we in it for the money, no
I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny
They got me turning off the radio
Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no
I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny
They got me turning off the radio
Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no
So what are you in it for?
So what are you in it for?
So what are you in it for?
The question remains
