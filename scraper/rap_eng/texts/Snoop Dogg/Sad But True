Hey I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
Hey I'm your life
I'm the one who cares
They, They betray
I'm your only true friend now
They, They'll betray
I'm forever there
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
(Fast, fast, fast!)
Sad but true!
