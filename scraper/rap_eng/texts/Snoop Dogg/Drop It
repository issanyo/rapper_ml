[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‘cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams
See these ice cubes? See these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million-dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear
Talkin' all that raspy shit, tryin' to ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it, take a second
Matter fact, you should take four, b
And think before you fuck with lil Skateboard P

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‘cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah, that's the Crip side
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much you thought I was a DJ
"Two, one, yep, three!"
S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See, I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live!
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a livin' room full of fine dime brizzles
Waitin' on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Chizzle
G's to the bizzack—now, ladies, here we gizzo!

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‘cause I got it goin' on
