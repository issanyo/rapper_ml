[Hook: Snoop Dogg (& Ice Cube)]
Uh, L.A. (yay yay!), Californi-i-a (Yay yay!)
City of ballers, Hollywood, we love it! (we love it)
Uh, L.A. (L.A.) , Californi-i-a (Californi-i-a)
City of ballers, Inglewood, we love it!

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Live from L.A., this way that-a-way
Slide in the hid-house, feeling burned did-out
Kick of your shoes and relax your feet
And party on down to this DJ Quik beat
The beat that gets you up and gets you outta your seat
Flip your BET on kick back and get your 'G' on
We on some west coast get those to the liquor store
Sippin' on some RÃ©my Martin before the show get started
It's gon' be off the hanger, and a few cool rap singers
I can't believe it, my boy got a show now
Bow wow, let's hit the corner in my four now
Long Beach style, make your woman wanna smile
And all guests on the show gonna bust a freestyle
Suggestin' questions and confessions
We havin' a good time on that BET live session
Let's move out to Swap Meet or Rodeo Drive
Or just post up by the Hollywood sign
We throwin' BBQ so life a grill
All my dawgs invited so y'all come on a chill
You at the beach or at the park or
Shootin' a [?] or at the park
Doin' it after dark
You heard me? Doin' it after dark


[Hook: Snoop Dogg (& Xzibit)]
Uh, L.A. (Los Angeles) , Californi-i-a (California)
City of ballers, Inglewood, we love it!
Uh, L.A. (Los Angeles) , Californi-i-a (California)
City of ballers, Hollywood, we love it!

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
I gotta call it hot shit now
Most people mistake havin' money for havin' style
We actin' wild up in the streets without a second thought
It's about gettin' away and gettin' caught
It's written thought, matter a fact in the form of X
I came to take everything except a final breath
I'm rock and rollin' coast to ya left side
After sunset we shine on the westside
So let 'em know, Cube

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
You know I got Snoop Dogg at my arraignment
Start a riot for this black entertainment
L-7's gotta ask who I came with, Xzibit
You midget, we don't rap it, we live it
Take it if you don't give it
BET is my digits, baby
So won't you come here, cause we can play all day
Live from LA, that's where the party people stay, yay yay
And we can do it like this, unless you flippin' on that
All black, get the format, sunny day, top back
Double R, high beams on the black and white or widescreen
Run and tell ya family tree that they can see me on BET
Weekly, and if it looks like Cube is gettin too much sun
I'm comin' live from L.A. havin' too much fun
Yay yay!

[Hook: Snoop Dogg (& Ice Cube)]
Uh, L.A. (yay yay!), Californi-i-a (Yay yay!)
City of ballers, Hollywood, we love it! (we love it)
Uh, L.A. (L.A.) , Californi-i-a (Californi-i-a)
City of ballers, Inglewood, we love it!
