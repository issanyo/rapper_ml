Your love for me is very serious
I won't play games with your tender
Look in my eyes, and say "I love you"
I'm for real, I'm for real

[Verse 1: Terrace Martin]
I kinda breeze with the summer wind
Sunday school swag, that's just how I feel
Lil mama look by me, keep her toasted
Beauty like a rose, blooming the summer wind (let's go)
Baby got her own whip
Top back, feelin' independent on a grown tip
Parked in the park, but night just let the day in
Watchin' the sunset, the kissin' lead to safe sex
I'm going swimming in your love boat
And if you can't swim you're bound to drown in your love pool
Play time's over, love, all my play this day is through
You and me together, you the type that I could stay too true to
And now, we back and forth
Bitin', kissin', lickin', fightin' in this little love war
Wakin' to the sun rays reflecting off your natural glow
I'mma choose lovin' you and just let all the hate go

Your love for me is very serious
I won't play games with your tender
Look in my eyes, and say "I love you"
I'm for real, I'm for real

[Verse 2: Terrace Martin]
Put my hand on your thigh, now I'm movin' up your back end
Full body massage, just 'bout to get it crackin'
Love the way you move, babe, save your man a lap dance
See you really want it, you've been practicin' your cool tricks
And I don't even know why all your friends be even hatin' for
Tell them haters, find some business, let love and let go
And ain't no part of me lettin' anybody think they're taking your love away from me, girl
And me had no idea, we shared a fear, now we channel air, jets
Swimming through the sky overlooking Bangladesh
Vacation into the Caymans, and Spain and Dubai next
The way you look at me when you lick your lips, it turns me on
Took me out this hateful world, you got me stayin' home
Missed you last night, fell asleep on the phone
But when we woke up in the morning
We was each other's first call, real love
