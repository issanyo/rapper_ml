One for ya Colombia
One for ya Colombia
Hands up
Where ya

(You can go all night)

Hands up
Where ya
Bottles up
West my cut
Party party
Feels good
Imma long way for my
Neighborhood
One for ya Colombia
Hot pace
Face to face
So many beautiful girls
What shall I do?
Ran-de-vu
It's two o'clock
Bottles pop
Make it hot
Now make it drop
I- I soon
Ayg√ºn
Snoop Dogg
High tunes
Number one
Having fun
On the one
The night is young
Insomnia
Hot like that coffee from
Colombia

(You can go all night)...
(You can go all night)...
