[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
It's ya uncle Snoop Dogg
They at it again
Bobby V and Tim
We don't want a lot

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Thoroughbred, you can tremble
Snoop Dogg on the platter, small sample
Hors d'oeuvre's, big words
G7's, big birds (wow)
Do thangs, you never done (never done)
Fun girl, fun guy, lets have fun (ayy, ayy)
No need to run that
You can tell ya girlfriends

[Verse 2: Bobby V]
Mona Lisa's got nothing on you
Perfect picture, no filter on you
Girl you know that my style is complete
You be trippin' 'cause you just a tease
You know this is my city fo' sho'
DJ shoutout when I walk through the door
You be bouncin' that thing while on your knees
There's so much game that you cannot believe (yeaahh)

[Bridge]
I can take you out, cruise on the yacht (yacht)
Seven figure nigga, jewels with the drop top
Picture that (uh huh)
Picture that (uh huh)
I know there's levels to the game girl, that's why I count
I'm the one you should be checking for (what's up)
I won't rush (uh huh)
A little piece will do

[Chorus]
All I need is a 'lil bit
Not a lot just a 'lil bit (yeah)
Take it off for me real quick
Sneak peek, let me get a grip
All I need is a 'lil bit
Baby girl, just a 'lil bit (yeah)
Take it off for me real quick
Sneak peek, let me get a grip

[Verse 3: Bobby V]
300,000 be following you
All these girls in here be bowing to you
You fill them cups with them full double d's
You got 'em drinkin' that flat tummy tea
Wish I were your shadow following you
When you wake up I be right in your room
In the shower where you bend over clean
It will be sittin' right there for me (Ayyy yeaaah)

[Bridge]
I can take you out, cruise on the yacht (yacht)
Seven figure nigga, jewels with the drop top
Picture that (uh huh)
Picture that (uh huh)
I know there's levels to the game girl, that's why I count
I'm the one you should be checking for (what's up)
I won't rush (uh uh)
A little piece will do

[Chorus]
All I need is a 'lil bit
Not a lot just a 'lil bit (yeah)
Take it off for me real quick
Sneak peek, let me get a grip
All I need is a 'lil bit
Baby girl, just a 'lil bit (yeah)
Take it off for me real quick
Sneak peek, let me get a grip (wooo)

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
My time was small, but through it all
She had a ball, she ain't want a lotta dick
She just want a 'lil bit
Gave her what she asked for
That's what I got the cash for (money money)
Now truly I am
I get what I gotta get, like Uncle Sam
No distortion, begging or forcin' (forcin')
And I can give it to ya in a small portion

[Chorus: Bobby V]
All I need is a 'lil bit
Not a lot just a 'lil bit
Take it off for me real quick
Sneak peek, let me get a grip
All I need is a 'lil bit
Baby girl, just a 'lil bit
Take it off for me real quick
Sneak peek, let me get a grip

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Bobby V (ahhh)
It's ya uncle Snoop Dogg
You know how we do
What it do, Tim?
Silky Slim
I just want a 'lil bit
