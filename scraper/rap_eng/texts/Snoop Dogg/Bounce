[Verse 1]
Drinking my cup, gas in my blood (what?)
These girls keep on meet me but I think they wanna fuck
Pocket for the money, R b&b [?]
Never been this close to a [?] again

[Pre-Chorus]
[?] turn it up and let it bang
Baby lookin' at me like she wanna be my fan
But can you smoke? Heal's toes?
And say she like to fuck with gangsta

[Chorus]
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Say she like to fuck with gangsta

[Post-Chorus]
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta

[Verse 2]
No, I get her what she needs
Here's some tangled break teen and some Snoop Dogg weed
Now we feel the goodest heal, tell me what I'm 'posed to do
If you was me and I was you, you would hit that Cucu juice
I ain't never have a clue, I ain't told, Eva who?
She's hole, we da
Roll the clone, diva
Sittin' on the sofa
But the smoke is doper
Naturally, my family won't like Cosa Nostra
Hol' up

[Chorus]
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Say she like to fuck with gangsta

[Post-Chorus]
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
