Ridahman, Ridahman, does whatever a rida can
What’s with that in your socks? And you fuckin’ niggas all want Siroc
Ridahman, Ridahman, keep a big getup inside my hand
What’s with that in your socks? Grab this motherfucker in your sight
Look out (look out!) bitch here comes the Ridahman

[Verse I:]
Now there once was a man who lived in my hood
To some people bad but to me he was good
He wore pindletens and 501 jeans
And the black Chuck Taylors with black yellow strings
He loved makin’ poise and smokin’ up blunts
And the weed that he be smokin’ have you flowin’ for months
You could smell the dealer comin’ from a mile away
And if he see the kids snoopin’ he be down to play
But if a nigga got to trippin’ he be down the sprets
That be AK—K-K-K-K-K
But this one time, this one guy
Thought he could come to our town and drive
And go against the ridah but Ridah is the ridah
He hit it with 11 and he knockin’ with the rida
He usually wore the shot but he gave the boy an ass
Said if you’ll come back nigga, that’ll be your ass
But the young nigga laughed, he didn’t seem to be scared
But he definitely took a car and got his ass up outta there
And we later found out that the guy’s name was Tommy
And Ridahman used to mess with his son’s mommy

[Hook]

[Verse II:]
Now Tommy went home and told his homeboy Ronny
And Ronny told Johnny and Johnny got money
And Lonny was a shooter and his weapon was a Tommy
He didn’t care about life, he’ll shoot anybody
So they came back to my neighborhood to drive
And found Ridahman and he ran ‘em for their lives
Used his rida senses to go behind the mine
What kind of car they drive? So he what (…)
And there they go. See him pass a nigga Black Reeker
So he reached into his pocket and pulled out a Desert Eagle
Rida start bussin’, I think he hit somethin’
Tommy falls out the car with his whole bullshit
And his homie didn’t make it, Ridahman got ‘em all
Even Lonny gave the kid a chance to bust the Tommy off
Ridahman goes over to Tommy and then he laughs
And he laughs ‘bout the nigga but my gun start blastin’
Yea, how’d you know that I was comin’ with my people?
And you even knew the car, how’d you knew it was a Reegle?
Well, besides me being the Ridahman
Your son’s mom told me, now okay, bye my man
