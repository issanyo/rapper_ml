Cold game (cold game), new twist (new twist)

My backbone, my wife in my life, been down wit a nigga before my paper was tite
Boo, you's a real bitch
I write that real shit
That them niggas just gots to get with
I bounce in and out of town just like a basketball player
Pass weed to the G's
And pass laws with the mayors
See, that's the difference between
You, me, and him
Nigga, I'm Silky Slim
With the feather in the brim
I swim underwater and don't get wet
Then bounce back to the hood and C-walk the set
I keep it gangsta all the time
An you can ask the Dubs, Insanes, and One-9
Cuz I'm...

Tryin to stop cars hoo-bangin this fast-lane game

I was learnin this game when you was servin your cane
It's where my shit's at
Flip rats tryin to get some get-back
Sit back, an holla at a playa bout... cold game

A bitch'll have you crossed up
An niggas get you crossed out
I can't hang and bang wit y'all no more y'all niggas flossed out
An papers what I'm all about
It's down that bullshit roll with y'all or take the baller
I take the baller out, he take the small amount
Long-term big shit nigga
That's what I'm all about
Call em out, stall em out
Fuck em, I twist em
The hardhead never listen
They never recognize and they never pay attention
