[Intro: 50 Cent]
Ayo what's up, yo this the kid 50 Cent man
It’s time to get high man, I need the blunt res, I need somethin'
Man, I'm finna roll this shit in newspaper
I don’t give a fuck nigga

[Snoop Dogg]
Can't forget Shadyville Queens
Bigg Snoop Dogg, live and direct
Please believe it when I tell you this
Shadyville Queens is in the muthafucka

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Every time you see me I be blowin' good dope
I'm always known for having nothin' but the endo
Every time you see me I be blowin' good dope
I'm always known for having nothin' but the endo
Every time you see me I be blowin’ good dope
I’m always known for having nothin' but the endo
So if you see me in your hood tryna lay low
I’m more than likely, I'm just tryna buy a bag of endo

[Snoop Dogg]
Ayo, anybody got a lighter?
