La dada di, la dada di, whoa, la dada di
La dada di, la dada di, whoa, la dada di

… and then last night, there was something that just didn't feel right
Decided I'd stay home instead of go and see my baby
Cause lately all we do is fight
Couldn't sleep so I went to turn the tv on, caught the last of the late night news
… with …of the city, and his name was one of the 2
So now I'm like, no, there's no way
They must of gotten it all wrong
He wouldn't let me this way, there's so much we didn't say
He didn't even say goodbye
So how did they try to tell me he's gone
Couldn't have been that easy
Don't let them take him away, we didn't even say goodbye

La dada di, la dada di, whoa, la dada di
La dada di, la dada di, whoa, la dada di

I keep calling his phone wishing he would pick it up
Hoping it was all a dream
Yellow tape holds the neighborhood back as I'm pulling up downhill street
Guess I'm thinking bout the last conversation we had
And the mean things that we've said
Wishing I could take the whole thing back
As I'm standing at his doorway, covered in red
No, there's no way
They must of gotten it all wrong
He wouldn't let me this way, there's so much we didn't say
He didn't even say goodbye
So how did they try to tell me he's gone
Couldn't have been that easy
Don't let them take him away, we didn't even say goodbye

La dada di, la dada di, whoa, la dada di
La dada di, la dada di, whoa, la dada di

All I want is you with me, all I wanna do is be
More than your friend, more like your man, would you agree?
You cooking for me, hugging, loving me now
Rubbing me down, baby boo yeah you in love with me now
And it's a apparent cause we share an apartment
You always argue Melanie, you love to start shit
We make love only kitchen floor to the carpet
I got somewhere to be but I don't wanna get off this
I'll hit you later on, when I'll get to my office
Your kisses are sweet, maybe the surface
Cha-cha-cha, jump in my car, feeling just like a star
Trying to get to where I need be, pushing it hard
In and out of traffic, going faster and faster
Not using my blinkers instead of using my flashers
I was going too fast, didn't think it would end
Now my baby girl would never ever see me again
I got shot in the street, and I don't know why
Left mad at my boo and I ain't even say bye
They say life is a chance and we call gonn die
So enjoy every minute as the time goes by
