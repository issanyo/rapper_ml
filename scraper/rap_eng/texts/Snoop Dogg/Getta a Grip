[:Intro]
Ha ha
Yea
Uh
Real shit
Check it out yo

[:Chorus]
Get a grip, get it fast
More smoke, more cash
DPG with the blue flag
One ratchet ho with a fat ass
Category, set it free, west coast
Motherfucker let it be
Get a grip, get it fast
More smoke, more cash

[:Kurupt]
Get it good, get it fast
All spark, all ass
Hit it 2 times, puff puff pass
Big Snoop, big Daz
Young Gotti, get it Gotti
Somebody in here smellin like hot karate
And that’s the way you comin up in this
No homo, and you expect to crack a bitch
Game for ya, good to ya
Then it’s still ‘fore you crack a bitch and let er spoil
Man I got bitches by the dozen tho
Didn’t know it, fucked er wrong and cracked my cousin’s ho
Superficial, so official, like a referee’s whistle
Test the G, test to me, next to be test the pistols
Coming off the deep dark circle of the VP
Gray and blue since you knew a Snoop ’92 or 3
This is how the motherfucker west is won
Ox cock to knock out his oxygen
Cuz we get it good, get it fast
Move, dance, everybody sag

[:Chorus]

[:Snoop Dogg]
Uhh, what a nigga really know about getting money out of this?
To the house, turn ‘em out, real shit
Gave a bitch real dick, that’s it, what a pity
Now she workin at sin City, poppin it, droppin it for cash
How long this shit gon last?
I move fast, grab me another ho
Yellow and thick, I’m drinking on tequila
Drapped in all feela, rollin my weed up
Click on seeder, straight off the meter
3 stripes for life, I’m paid my Adidas
Fly senioritas, good time to meet us
4-20 after dark, down by seritas
Home of the Steelers, cat feelers and dealers
Or I’d own a bitch, no lane, for whip up hillas, killas
They kill in the day time, wanna be seen
I’m on a bad bitch, with a purse full of green
We grew up on the same blunt but we’re not the same kind
Game over, nigga it’s game time
I swing mine like a 6 deuce turnt up
Til it get loose I’m on the blunt, she on the pill you bitch
You…

[:Chorus]
