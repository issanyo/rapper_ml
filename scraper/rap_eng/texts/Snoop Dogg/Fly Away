[Intro: Shon Lawon]
I wanna fly so far away baby could you fly away with me?
I wanna fly so far away baby could you fly away with me?

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Let me take you on a trip around the world
To me, you are that special girl
And if you can find the time to fly in the sky
Just you and I, to paradise
Cause you're my special girl

[Chorus: Shon Lawon]
I wanna fly so far away baby could you fly away with me?
I wanna fly so far away baby could you fly away with me?
I wanna fly so far away baby could you fly away with me?
I wanna fly so far away baby could you fly away with me?

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
We are living in a special world
That's why you're special girl
And I love your personality
So you should fly away, fly away with me

[Chorus: Shon Lawon]
I wanna fly so far away baby could you fly away with me?
(Could you fly away with me?)
I wanna fly so far away baby could you fly away with me?
(I always wanna fly away with you)
I wanna fly so far away baby could you fly away with me?
(Would you fly away, fly away with me?)
I wanna fly so far away baby could you fly away with me?
(Cause I wanna fly away with you, fly away with me)

Fly away, fly away, fly away
So far away
So far, so far away
I wanna fly so far away baby could you fly away with me?
(Let's fly away)

We gon be so high in sky and we're never coming down
So, baby, would you fly away with me?

[Chorus: Shon Lawon]
I wanna fly so far away baby could you fly away with me?
