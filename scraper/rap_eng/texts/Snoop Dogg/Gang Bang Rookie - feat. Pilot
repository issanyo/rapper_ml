I'm not down with the republic party or the democratic aprty
I represent the gangsta party
The gangsta party?
Yes Sir
I ain't no gangbang rookie on the gangbang fool me
I'm a boss out here on the west
..is my home which rollin with my blue bandana on my neck
Girl, come f*ck with Snoop , sign up on my team there's a little room left
Girl, you heard on my songs, steady .., steady wrong, don't get your ass left
Church on the move nigga, now got and hit the turf with the news nigga
I got some advice for you mew niggers, you wanna be in the league well tell'em who sent ya?
Twistin up the old G, about the whole P, untill I .. D
They all come, they all wanna see, hoes lovin me, you all niggers wanna be (Snoop, Snoop)
Even blood f*ck occurs, I hate the club, they're all showing me love
They like Snoop Dog

Chorus:
Can i get you a autograph, so put that DPG doggystle and aftermath
I just laugh while I'm twistin' ... bad *tches kissin' till they takin' bubblebath..
I ain't no gangbang rookie police tryna put me ima' modern day trickky on a set
I got the whole party poppin see you hater niggas jokin all these ice cold diamonds on my chest
They see my whole team bugging, not in me mugging
But that no meant ...
Cuz if there's problem I put the problem solver

Get the dollars, .. get in common
It's time to get this change just like Obama
But I'm gonna stay the same on my mother f*cker mama
Snoop, Snoop

Twistin up the old G, about the whole P, untill I .. D
They all come, they all wanna see, all lovin me, you all niggers wanna be (Snoop, Snoop)
Even blood f*ck occurs, I hit the club, they're all showing me love
