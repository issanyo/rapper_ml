[Intro: Snoop Dogg, Corey's angels]
Kitty kitty (?)
Hit the club (tell 'em)
(Go for it)

[Verse 1: Corey Feldman]
They're trying to beat you down
They want you on the ground
They leave you lying at the door
Don't make a sound
No one will notice them
They turn and laugh again
They make you
Make from us is till nobody noticed them

[Pre-Chorus 1: Corey Feldman and Corey's angels]
Just when you think it's all over
Know whom realizes what you're gonna do
Every shot fired from execution
So what, what have you got to lose

[Chorus 1: Corey Feldman and Corey's angels]
We got nothing to lose so baby baby
Let's go for it
Go for it
We got nothing to lose so baby baby
Let's go for it
Go for it
You gotta reach for the sky
Ain't no problems to hide
Go for it
No we're not gonna stop
Until we reach the top
Go for it, go for it

[Verse 2: Corey Feldman]
Well mine's the tallest shoe
Set to abolish you
And you'll get beaten 'till they become bad news
So yeah this again
They match your name with shame
They go and laugh at you yet nobody knows their name

[Pre-Chorus 2: Corey Feldman]
[?] Again I feel beaten
Don't have the strength to carry on
It comes down to love and devotion
A fight faced it's something that I cannot lose

[Chorus 2: Corey Feldman and Corey's angels]
We got nothing to lose so baby baby
Let's go for it
Go for it
We got nothing to lose so baby baby
Let's go for it
Go for it
I first step into the club
And start tearing it up
Go for it
Don't get me out on the floor
I'll make you beg for some more
Go for it, go for it

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Kitty kitty
I'm about to finish it and lie with it
Hit the club (He said it Snoop)
I said this girl, show me love (Come on give it to me now)
Kitty kitty
I'm about to finish it and lie with it
Hit the club (He said it Snoop)
I said this girl, show me love (Come on give it to me now)
Kitty kitty
Cause all I want you to do is work
Too much answers [?]
All she gonna do is twerk
All I wanna do is party
I've been drinking in my cup
There is kush in my lungs (let's do it man)
[?] roll at us
'Cause if it is let me tell you [?]
Give it up
We gon' blaze, we gon' blaze

[Chorus 3: Corey Feldman, Snoop Dogg & Corey's angels]
Go for it
Yeah, I gotta go for one
Go for it
Go for it
Kitty kitty
All she gonna do is twerk
Hit the club
Tear it up (go for it)
Kitty kitty
All she gonna do is twerk
(I get it out on the floor now)
Hit the club
Tell 'em
Go for it (down on the floor now)
