Be next, Be NXT
BE Different, Be weird
Be huggers, Be fireflies
Be mohawks, Be beards

Like no one, Like nothing
Like whatever, Like this
Like Asuka, Like Charlotte
Like Becky, Like Bliss

No tapouts, No count outs
No 3-counts, No friends
No stopping, NOstalgia
No now with, No then

(Woooooooo)

One shot in one million
One versus all, One team
One Finn, One Balor
One demon, One king

Be hated, Be vacant
B-R-A-Y

Like Jimmy, Like Jay
Like even this guy

No divas, No mud fights
No thanks

One Sasha, One Boss
One word, Banks

Be heard, Be seen

Like Dolph, Like Dean

No guts, No glory

One shot, One story

Be you

Like now

No time

One run

Be like no one
