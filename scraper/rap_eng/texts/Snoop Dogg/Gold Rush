[Verse 1: Charlie Wilson]
I love the take to our place
You ain't never baby
Yes explore our mains
You won't regret it
No second guesses
Trust your instincts
Use your senses babe

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Ain't goin' be no sleepin' till we die
Let's explore the peak of didn't know
All this energy between us
Baby all I mean is what you want

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Don't panic on 'em
It's a gold rush, gold rush
It's a gold rush
It's a gold rush
Let's not loose it babe

[Verse 2: Charlie Wilson]
Your expectations, I reach
You ain't gotta speak
I know what you engrave
You're so persuasive, illuminating
This ain't no dream, this reality-y-y

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Ain't goin' be no sleepin' till we die
Let's explore the peak of didn't know
All this energy between us
Baby all I mean is what you want

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Then I'm gone
It's a gold rush, gold rush
It's a gold rush
It's a gold rush
Let's not loose it babe

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Your place of mind, look me in the eye
Stop wasting time, taste the wine
Taste the shine, taste your lips
Now you gotta taste the mind
Tag 'em right in, twist the lines
Ship the wine, mix with mine
Not here to skip your mind
Whip you fine and tasting tips of vibe
This is why, you better put enough on me
Go rush on me, fluff when I puff on me
Be a whole and ruff on me
Lie down, probably put a cuff on me
Wrap in a ribbon, don't unroll it
And I think that we can go so far away
To a place that, you embrace that
We can love lay
You're livin' a day, your love is so good
You might as well give it away
So choosy baby, charming and slippy baby

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Then I'm gone
It's a gold rush, gold rush
It's a gold rush
It's a gold rush
Let's not loose it babe
