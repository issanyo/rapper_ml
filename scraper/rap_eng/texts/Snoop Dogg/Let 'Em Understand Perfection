[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Comin' so swift and upliftin', shiftin' into gears
Everybody snap, tap, clap cause this is the year
For Perfection, my motherfuckin' homies
To put they shit on the map and finally get they fuckin' snaps
Broke off like it was supposed to be done
Niggas sayin' they weak due to the fact that one
Nigga decided to leave and get his rap on elsewhere
Ask me if they care and I give you a stare like no
You can't cope, they dope, but outtie
Fools that follow slowly will surely become Audi
5000, that's word to the D-O-G
So what I'ma do is give these niggas the M-I-C
And let them prove themselves so you can understand
That one rapper stepped and left and then ya bend him
That shit ain't right but peep game
These brothers got somethin' to prove so I'ma exchange
Hand the mic from mic to hand, T-Dubb the first one up
So let 'em understand

[Verse 2: T-Dubb]
Let 'em understand perfection, and that's how it's gonna go
T-Dubb's up first with the dope ass intro
I'm comin' and comin' with the style, see, it's 'bout time
Now ain't all business, I believe 'em without the nine
Downin' the 40, the gin and juice gets me bent
You start the trippin' and flippin' and then ya hit the C
Niggas know a G like me don't play
Disagree, then I got something to say
The homies talkin' about I feel they seem to be raisin' hell
My mom is bitchin' cause I'm in and out of every jail
Feel like the way that's how my life been spent
Got the G ass limpin' when I left San Quent
So I thought to myself, "T-Dubb ya need some direction"
I hooked up with the posse, now we're known as Perfection
Now I got it goin', all my pockets are stayin' fat
Give me the mic, a pen and paper, here's a dope rap
Niggas talkin' 'bout T-Dubb can't bust it, they came in late
I see em walkin' down the street, they bumpin' this dope tape
Before you come around me lookin' for protection
I'm lettin' em understand perfection

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
My nigga T-Dubb expressed himself, oh yes he did
Now it's time for the DJ to put his bid in
Ya thinkin' he's mixin' the mix, well your ass is wrong
Glaze finna get his mothafuckin' rap on
So would whack DJ's back up off the 12 gauges
Give him some room, while the boom from the stage is
Tripped up, flipped up, ripped up, but it's effective
Understand perfection from a DJ's perspective

[Verse 4: DJ Glaze]
I'ma drop a mothafuckin' bomb when it all seems calm
But then I'm not from Vietnam
And if I was then it's because I'm usin' street tactics
Practice makes perfection, but Perfection don't practice
And Glaze is the homie cuttin' records like a villain
So buy the album cause we're gonna make a killin'
And I'ma carry a nation
Fade in to Perfection gets a standing ovation
So ya better comprehend
Glaze is on the bet, on deck is MNM
This is dedicated to those who wanna get with me
Think again if you thought I didn't even have it in me
They said I couldn't hang or sheer
But Perfection's guaranteed to drop a gang of shit
So make way for the F to the L-A-P, flow into a T
Cause I'm kickin' em, kickin' em, kickin' em like a G
So take heat to a Filipino bandit
While I make 'em understand it

[Verse 5: Snoop Dogg]
God-diggy-di-damn Glaze, you make a nigga not wanna flow
From me to you homie, hmm, they don't hear you though
But-ah let me see who's next, expressin'
Is it my boy MNM, cause if it is, grab a Wesson
The one that belongs to Smith
Don't riff or skip, just hit the spliff and shoot ya gift
Until these bustas stop flexin'
MNM let 'em understand perfection

[Verse 6: MNMsta]
I'm bringing up the tray, Glaze, make a quick getaway
Fellas bringing they cellers and beepers up for the layaway
Clear the airwaves cause I'ma blast off like NASA
Ya better move quick cause you're in the midst of a tongue-twistin' disaster
Movin' at rapping speeds that no other will really consider
Blowin' and flowin' and throwin' until my lips start to blister
Pissin' and messin' a lesson I'm puttin' opponents up to the test
[?] I gotta dismiss em and put your ass to rest, yo
Quicker than quick and lickin' the spliff, I'm blowin' em outta my windpipe
[?] battle and then I spiddaddle all lyrical pimp fights
I bury the [?] styles [?] show again I'm the greatest
[?] so don't even try to fade this
I'm runnin' and gunnin' and stunnin' and bringin' em to a complete halt
Flippin' and grippin' em with my lips, like my mouth was doing a somersault
[?] who try to battle Perfection
When I'm movin' and groovin' [?] breakin' Henderson
Swingin' and bringin' em thangs when I droppin' them dogs on em
Stompin' em up on my opponents like I'm a fuckin' bulldozer
I'ma [?] and makin' and takin' em, like a joint you get smoked
I'm shakin' and fakin', breakin' em down, fuck it, case closed

[Verse 7: Snoop Dogg]
Wooh shit, that was the dope stuff
But you know what they say, as it goes, it gets ruff
Now it's time to get taken to the streets
So fall into the rhyme as I fall into the beat
Cause comin' around the house is the G
My motherfuckin' homie Tender D
He's never fakin' for breakin' em off a proper sack
Maniac, brainiac, it's my nigga Wayniac
Villain, crook, thief, whatever you wanna name him
Punk bitches, please, don't try to game him
Cause if you do you know he's down for checking a hoe
In a minute you should know he's in it to win it
I done joked too much, I done spoke too much
So Tender D (what up?) go 'head and fuck shit up

[Verse 8: Wayniac]
Doggy Dogg kicked it off, so I think I better handle it
Your time has ticked for the loc you can't fuck with
Causin' damage and you still can't manage to deal
With a nigga like me that's out for the kill, ya see
Recruited by the greatest for harmony and poetry
Labeled as a G, for those who don't know of me
Correction after cause, matin' girls after menopause
And still young-minded, I'm the player with the big drawers
And an itty bitty kitty in the city, oh what a pity
Now it's time for me to get to the nitty gritty
Step up, come on, come off, I'm havin' a ball
Take you on a ride, you think it was a free fall
Lyrical minded so you all can adapt well
Came out of your shell when I rocked your bells well
And I still ain't had enough
Cause when the goin' gets rough, the Tender's all that's showin' up
And to the nigga that left before their time
Your ass is mine at the end of the finish line
Cause I'm a nigga with a master plan
Fuck it, I know they understand
