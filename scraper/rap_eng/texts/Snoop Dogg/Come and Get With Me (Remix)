So all the ladies that wanna get with us
You got to be special, VIP
Come get with me, mmm

Goodness grief, it's Snoop and Keith Sweat
A double dose of this triple threat
Yep, Moet White Star in a glass
Here's a toast to the fool that let you slip through with no pass
All access, you can jump in and test
When we through parlayin', you dig what I'm sayin'
You look good, girl, but you'd look better if you was with me
Get in where you fit in, let's do this VIP

Look at you, Shorty, you really got it goin' on (You know you got it
Goin' on)

You're lookin' real good to me (Lookin' good to me) sittin' in a VIP
You really need to get with me (Come on)

Crystal blowin', party still goin'
Crowd pleasers everywhere, but I still had to stop and stare
'Cause you're lookin' real good to me (So good) sittin' in a VIP
You really need to get with me (Oh, yeah)

Go to a part of town where we can fool around
Girl, I wanna turn you on (Turn you on), make love all night long (Like
That)
You're lookin' real good to me [You know you look good to me like music
Huh, huh]

Now I have seen a lot of girls, but none like you
Your red-boned and thick, got it goin' on, ooh
She's in the next room, I slid by the restroom
And all I heard was zoom-zoom-zoom
I see you peekin', but you ain't speakin'
Put your drink down, think now, stop tweekin'
A once in a lifetime experience
Come get with me, it'll be luxurious, I'm serious, and curious
To find out what turns you on
I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg with the doggy bone
Hangin' with Keith Sweat in his VIP section
Tryin' to give you more than the average affection
???Type 'em all???, close the doors, it's goin' down
You never thought that Keith Sweat would hook up with the Dogg Pound
Gangster's finest, take time to listen
Come get with me 'cause we on a mission

Come on get with me, Shorty [Come spend the night tonight]
I got what you need [I'll make you feel alright]
Come on get with me [Come get with me, babe]
I got what you need [Got what you need, girl]

Yo', yo', what's happenin', baby

We gon' get you in, that's all I can say
Kill 'em with the DPG, doin' it VIP
That's real
Don't even worry about no wristband
You rollin' with the Dogg, right, yeah

Holler at a player, holler at a player (Yeah)
Holler at a player (Yeah), holler at a player, DPG
Holler at a player (Get with me), holler at a player (Get with me, come
