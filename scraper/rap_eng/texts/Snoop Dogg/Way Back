[Verse: T-Boz]
It's been a long, long time comin'
Ain't seen you around
Time keeps on passin'
But you still my bitch
Can't tell us nothin'
And it's nothin' but a thing, to pick up where we left off (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
Don't you ever think
Back on all that other shit we went through
You know I remember (yeah)
Don't you ever wish
One day we could reminisce
It feels like, we were just together
Cause we go way back

[Hook]
Like Prince and Marvin Gaye
Like South side on Sunday
Some things don't ever change
Yeah, you and me
Cause we go way back
James Brown and Michael J
Like them high school parties
Some things don't ever change
Yeah, you and me
We go way back

[Verse: Snoop]
Twistin' up a twenty sack
Fishin', listen, reminiscin' bout the days of way back
Aye, where the ladies at?
I need to find one, top designer
Baby can you help me find one?
A real one, not a phony, I want a own me
Never leave me lonely, be my tenderoni
One hour photo together, take a few flicks together, that'll last forever
Whether, we do, you do? me too
See through it all, now creep with the Dogg
Don't let the rain drops stop ya, I got ya
This is so evolutionary proper
Now what the future holds, no one knows
But the past is a blast, game overload
It's like Good Times, my favorite episodes
I'm just the same OG, givin' y'all a little TLC

[Verse: T-Boz]
I'd like to think, when we were growin' (growin')
And shit got tough, we kept it goin' (goin')
Out in the streets, no signs of slowin' (yeah)
It's still nothin' but a thing, to pick up where we left off (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
Don't you ever think
Back on all that other shit we went through
You know I remember (yeah)
Don't you ever wish
One day we could reminisce
It feels like, we were just together
Cause we go way back

[Hook]
Like Prince and Marvin Gaye
Like South side on Sunday
Some things don't ever change
Yeah, you and me
Cause we go way back
James Brown and Michael J
Like them high school parties
Some things don't ever change
Yeah, you and me

[Bridge]
We go way back
Way back, way back, way back, way back (yeah)
Cause we go way back
Way back, way back, way back, way back
We go way back

[Hook]
Like Prince and Marvin Gaye
Like South side on Sunday
Some things don't ever change
Yeah, you and me
Cause we go way back
James Brown and Michael J
Like them high school parties
Some things don't ever change
Yeah, you and me
