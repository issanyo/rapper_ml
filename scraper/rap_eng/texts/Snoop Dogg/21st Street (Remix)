[Verse 1]
One time for my cut cause you know we stop, whoop
Put $100,000 in ya ' favorite girl account
14 carrots in ya' boy ear, 35 go for 40 over here
Shut up girl, you don't know our lingo
I LOVE MAKONNEN turn a song to a single
Race me at the party, hell no, we can't mingle
Make the.. other flavors like Pringles
Selling the dope we get risky, NYPD don't stop and frisk me
Keep it OG and ya' bound to get plenty
Mothafuckas' mad cause we known in every city and

[Hook]
Downtown, on 21st street
We take it all around the town in 21st street
Money going up-town, money going downtown
Money going up-town, money going downtown
Money going up-town, money going downtown
Money going up, money going down

[Verse 2]
Ballin' on hoes, you know I do
Have racks over there on North Druid
Hate on me, for what? I don't know
Straight on thee, the beef is a go
I know what to do get whisky
All the time these fuckas' hatin on me.. Oh whoa, whoa
36 nines, too high for a bike
Slap your face twice 'till your eyes get it right
On me callin' the po' po'
Saying he's bringing the nose dope
When you know that tale is a mothafuckin' lie
Cause I'm the smartest guy in the FBI
Rated 2003 on the S.A.T and sold the fuckin' pound at the A.C.T
Ask the pimps in your town if they know about me
Cause I'm something that the legends all inspired to be
On 21st street, I make my money downtown

[Bridge]
Downtown, down, down, downtown
I make my money down, downtown on 21st street
I'm taking it all around the town

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
This is the street where it all goes down
And you gotta stand tall, keep your feet on the ground
Know, know, bow wow, new style, oh how?
On your fucking bitch, I spend a couple thou'
And then you wonder how, I am so original
Pop twice then lean back, smooth like a criminal
My nig, these are not antonyms
These are mac bars based off Slim and 'em
A couple pimps on that 21 Street keep that thang
Just in case ya'll niggas want beef
Slide stuff, dye stuff, go H.A.M
I hit the corner in a '78, drop top Boham
Top back, pop back, right where I was in the fast lane
Fuck a rain in the cup, put the pain in the blunt
Put the pain in the blunt
I'm hanging with my niggas, I don't really give a fuck
21, nigga

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Fuck up off me nigga, fuck wrong with you nigga? This that mothafuckin' straight crack, this that mothafuckin' dead crack right here nigga. What you gone do, you tryna hit this? Or you just tryna' stay here in my goddamn face. Get fuck out my goddamn face

[Outro]
Uh, skurrt, here nigga, hit this weed so you can skurrt
Hit the pound on the ounce and then skurrt
All the bitches coming outta town like, skurrt
I LOVE MAKONNEN, where you at, I had to skurrt
What? Hold up you got the pack? I'mma skurrt
Come around your town with the sacks like skurrt
Mothafuckas' mad cause I'm back like skrr
You know if a fucka' try to sleep on us
Walk yo' ass up like a line for yo' bus
Boy don't miss that bus at ya' mothafuckin' school
Yo' ass stupid, you gone be a damn fool
Shoulda' stayed yo' ass in that goddamn house
Now you kicked out, living like a fuckin' mouse
I hit the gas on the pedal then skurrt
Drop the top on bitches down the street and then skurrt
Loving all the way I got the money like skurrt
I don't give a fuck bitch you ain't a pretty, skurrt
I only talk to girls that wear mini skirts
Downtown on 21st Street
