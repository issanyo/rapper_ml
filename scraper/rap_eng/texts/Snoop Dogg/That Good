[Chorus - Wiz Khalifa]
I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)

I'm rolling every gram I own
(That purp, that bomb, that kush)
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that fire, that good, that good, that

[Snoop Dogg]
Concentrated, every day I'm faded
Tree's prepared and properly cultivated
I nursed 'em, sprayed down, no chemicals
Just me and my buddy, ya hear me now

Never treat ya wrong, to each his own
Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong
We up in smoke, making street schemes
Smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams

Break it down, put it in the zig zag
And pull the top back and let the ass drag
Hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch
Executive Branch, get a whiff of this

Black car, sack a dank
High school nigga what the fuck you think
I'm passing all my classes with flying colors
And every day I'm high as a muthafucker

[Chorus]
I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)

I'm rolling every gram I own
(That purp, that bomb, that kush)
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that fire, that good, that good, that

[Wiz Khalifa]
Sun roof open, smoking while I'm rolling
My bitches only notice it if it's potent
Bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean
Get in between your legs

Join roaches and ashes all in your bed
You calling her babe, she calling me instead
Cause I put that game all in her hair
She saw the crib, she know that I'm balling
When he ain't have nothing he used to stall 'em
Now I with the boss dogg, all the bad hoes want him
And my pockets on swole, I'm talking Rick Ross big

And now when we shop we don't care what the cost is
Rolling up good, smoking that bomb shit
Blow a whole OZ, nigga that's boss shit
Now she all fuck her man, rubber bands in my pocket
Getting money, going hard for my profit
Bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings
Young nigga getting bread, why knock it?

[Chorus]
I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)

I'm rolling every gram I own
(That purp, that bomb, that kush)
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that fire, that good, that good, that

In high school, we do just like we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up get high to it
We welcome you to high school

We do just like we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up get high to it
Get high to it

[Chorus]
I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)

I'm rolling every gram I own
(That purp, that bomb, that kush)
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that fire, that good, that good, that
