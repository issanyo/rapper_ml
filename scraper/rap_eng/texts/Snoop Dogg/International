[Verse One: 2Pac]
Eternally thug nigga Hilfiger, made by Tommy
So when I speak hope to reach my Boricua mammies
Oh come to poppy, I love it when it's wet and sloppy
In and out the mouth piece, until I cum no one can stop me
My bump 'n' grind ll do ya every time
Come get a blast of this thug passion, it'll blow ya mind
Hey!! Throw up your legs, wrap them shits around my back
It's a West Side thing fuckin' hoes around the map
Walkin' down 125 while I'm peepin' out hotties
And they, seduce my Jimmie, I'll be screamin' give me body
Make 'em all scream my name out, give me my props
And don't ya, love how this thug nigga beat up the cop
I'm at the Rican parade, I'm watching caramel bitches play
Get with real niggas, bullshit ll never get you paid
This is the dream of a young black team
I fiend for hoes cross country like a greedy crack fiend
Now c'mon

[Chorus]
(Hey girl)
I can tell that you want it
By the way your dancing on the floor
(Hey girl)
By the look in your eyes
I can tell you want some more
(Oh girl)
Don't worry bout it just keep doing what you do
(Hey girl)
Girl tonight you can be
International

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Ok, look, check it out
Nipsey when I pull up to the club
On them chrome things
I'm crispy
Shining from my wrist to my gold chain
Everywhere I go I keep the hood I never change
If it ain't up on my lap
Got it stashed in the Range
Bang, bang
I'm getting bread on the proper
Private jet anywhere I tell him he go fly to
My respect had these girls saying Daddy I do
Anything you ask get it cracking when I slide through
As God as my witness, right hand on the bible
In Tokyo honey turned it up
Arigatou stroked for show
Now up in Atlanta in the strip club
She thick Cuz took me to the stop, where the crib was
Went full throttle got cracking I ain't bashed yet
From the kitchen to the counter top, in the bathroom
Flips mo', trips mo' stamps on my passport
Told her drop me off at Heartsville
I'm international

[Chorus]
[Chorus]
(Hey girl)
I can tell that you want it
By the way your dancing on the floor

So of course I'm ready to get it
Feel it going down right now
Hopped in the whip
Popped the bottle lit a blunt right now
Get it out of it about 50 seconds later

Escape through the front though they

Cruising up to get the door
If you lose a chick then let her go
She done chose it's over bro
Look around it's Harleyville
