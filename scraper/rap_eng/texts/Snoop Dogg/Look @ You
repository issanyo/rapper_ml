[Hook]
'Lil mama, look at you
'Lil mama, look at you
Got the whole club screamin' out "DIU"
'Lil mama, look at you
Got the whole club screamin' out "DIU"
'Lil mama, look at you

[Verse 1]
The whole party gon' pop like it's supposed to
Molly drops, lemon shots, let me show you
A whole different world
You're half-naked try'na act like a church girl
Bitch, I know you
Who's your friend? The thick one with the green eyes
The one I seen last week in with T.I
You ain't down to do the thing, what you round for?
Get your ass up, what you turnin' down for?

[Bridge]
The whole party's on pop
The whole party's on pop
The whole party's on pop

[Hook]
