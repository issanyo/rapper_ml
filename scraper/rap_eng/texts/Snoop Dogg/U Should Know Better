[Verse 1: Robyn]
I've gone around the world and the seven seas
I'm cashing six-figure checks in all currencies
It's like when I be tearing it up in Paris
Motherfuckers parler on the m-i-c
It's all ooh la la and ahh oui oui
Sipping vin blanc in our lingerie
Chopping heads off with madame guillotine
Even the French know better than to fuck with me

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Comment allez-vous Robyn, what it do
I'm in the UK (why?) I've got a show to do
It's big Snoopy Dogg, check the catalog
I'm overseas getting cheese with this dialogue
I missed my plane to Spain so I'm stuck in Cologna
I'm sipping Saronno with this chick named Ramona
She wants me to take a flick on her phone-ah
Then take her to my hotel room and then bone her

[Verse 3: Robyn]
You know when in Rome I sat down with the Romans
Said "We need a black pope and she better be a woman"
There'll be no more celibacy
Even the Vatican knows not to fuck with me

[Chorus: Robyn and Snoop Dogg]
You should know better
Y-You should know better
You should know better than to fuck with me
If you knew better you would do better

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
We big-balling in Holland, Amsterdam my man
I got a table at the coffee shop
Where we like to spark a lot
Hanging in the parking lot blowing a bleezy
Easy fo sheezy deezy

[Verse 5: Robyn]
I crashed a party with the Czar
Threw a Molotov cocktail in the bar
And you know my style's revolutionary
Even the Russians know better than to fuck with me

[Verse 6: Snoop Dogg]
You try to ban me, you can't stand me
Cuz I'm an outlaw
Black president living in the White House
Mr. B he wrote a letter to me
The FBI know better than to fuck with me

[Verse 7: Robyn]
Yo I was there at Watergate
You know I rigged my gear got the fuckers on tape
They put the mic in the hand of the wrong MC
Even the CIA knows not to fuck with me

[Chorus: Robyn and Snoop Dogg]
You should know better
Y-You should know better
You should know better than to fuck with me
If you knew better you would do better

[Refrain: Robyn]
Tell 'em Snoop, tell 'em like it is

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg & Robyn]
I been there, in there, out there like that
Right back to the hood, a hundred Euro stacks
Shoot motherfuckers just on GP
LAPD know better than to fuck with me
I danced with the devil in Kathmandu
I came humming and blasting with the boogaloo too
Now I declare most solemnly
The prince of darkness know better than to fuck with me

[Verse 8: Snoop Dogg]
You know not what you know
Tell them what I'm in it for
Then I run up in it slow
Really though, silly ho
Yeah it's been a minute though
I blow an ounce and make you bounce
Just like a sixty-four

[Verse 9: Robyn]
Now you know me I'm a woman of peace
I don't never take nothin' don't belong to me
I throw down and say, "Whatever's gonna be, gon' be\"
The whole industry knows not to fuck with me

[Chorus x3: Robyn and Snoop Dogg]
You should know better
Y-You should know better
You should know better than to fuck with me
If you knew better you would do better
