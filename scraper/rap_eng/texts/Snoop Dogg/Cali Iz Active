We got heaters, smoke, drank, bitches
Fo's, deuces, trayz, switches
Riders, money, houses, boats
Notes, uncompromisable quotes

I'mma bang on bitch boy, set it off, start it
Me, Snoop and Daz bangin' on the blue carpet
Chucks and accessories
Like the two heaters the homie got next to me
You don't know me but you don't know "shoo"
It's me and Daz posted with Coach Snoop
But I'll ride with ya if ya wanna ride with me
Cause we bangin' on the streets, D.P.G. bang

I'm yellin' (gangsta, gangsta!)
Dippin' in my '6-6, chrome deep dish
Today could be your death wish
I'm from Cali the birth of the Impala
Them '6-4 old schools, them boys got dollars
Big diamonds, big wheels, low-lows to the ground
Get active fool (that's how we get down)
Scrapin' the bumper - you know I keep that thumper
15's subbin' just like a Dogg Pound concert
L.A. Dodger cap, switches hittin' from front to back
(We back doin' it big like that)
Khakis, All-Star's, white T's, gang flags
D.P.G.C. on my tags

Them Dogg Pound Gangstas, niggas is active
Keep poppin' that shit then I'm gettin' to blastin'
Ain't no compromise, ain't no talkin' or askin'
I'm takin' off first and the scene will be drastic

Just another day in my neighborhood
I bang the hood, I cocaine slang in the hood
I'm bringin' the goods, in other words I'm bringin' the buzz
I'm swingin' my cuz, in a blue vein switchin' lanes
Backseat full of goods, what it do huh?
Baby suckin' on a blow pop
Put your seatbelt on, let me make the fo' hop
I get out and Crip Walk on the block
Left hand on my Glock, 20 Crip and it don't stop
Yeah nigga, I can always tell a scared nigga
Ol' loudmouth busta ass nigga wouldn't break a glass
Now he wanna run up on me and mash
I catch him by himself, now he talkin' fast
"Oh, Snoop Dogg, please don't blast!"
Don't worry 'bout a motherfuckin' thang
But worry 'bout my homies cause my homies gon' bang on the game

Move your body, everybody
California, yeah they be
Probably hardly come to party without nothin' happening
This is how we like to do it, spike the punch with Hennessy
And we bangin' on you niggas who ain't from that D.P.G
Dogghouse Radio... (D.P.G.'s)
Gangbang activity... (that's all we do cuh)
Dogghouse Radio... (D.P.G...C.)
Gangbang activity...
