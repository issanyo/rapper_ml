[Intro: Daz & (Snoop Dogg)]
Hey Snoop
(What's Up?)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I put down more hits than mafioso made
And Lucky Luciano 'bout to sing soprano
And I know, I know the way you feel
And baby bubba we gon' keep it on tha real
Just to get you caught up in amazement
We puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous
But when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack
And let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha
How you feelin'? I'm up to dealin', ridin' like a villain
Makin' a killin', thrillin' the crowd wit my new hairdo
Outfits unused, fifty dollar socks, hundred-thousand dollar shoes
Man, I'm givin' blues to these sucka MC's
Who you be? You know who I be, young nigga
I'm Tha DoggFather


[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, c'mon
Uh c'mon
Uh c'mon
Uh c'mon
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)
Uh c'mon
Uh c'mon
Uh c'mon

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Let's make a move for this paper (Where we rollin' Dogg?)
We got's ta get paid (Makin' money all ya'll)
I mean I steps to tha stage in my G-boy stance
And say a few rhymes to make your girl wanna dance
I'm so fly like a dove
I come from up above
You trippin' on your girl cause she showed me love
Nigga don't beat em, cause if you beat 'em, you don't need 'em
You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom
I delete em, but don't mistreat 'em
I stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on
Let me flow on
You can rock to the rhythm you see
Or you can rock to the rhythm of me
Just remember when you do your thang
Make sure you do your thang on a hang
And everything, is everything
There ain't no mo' than this paper chase
Like them white boy DA's was on the case
You know I ain't tryna floss, but uh
Murder was the, murder was the case that they lost
I'm Tha DoggFather

[Bridge]
C'mon, yeah, c'mon, c'mon
Somebody say "hell yeah"
Hell yeah
Say "hell yeah"
Hell yeah
Do anybody in the house remember?
C'mon, c'mon, yeah, c'mon
C'mon
C'mon
C'mon
C'mon

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Now, do anybody in the house remember
When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)
There wasn't no rappers hollerin' 'bout LBC
Am I trippin' ya'll? (Hell nah!)
Now, when I grow up, I wanna be like Snoop
Have prestigious women
That's the truth from the beginning
In and out of the flyest hotels
You say your family don't know me
Hold on homie, that's for most and promos
Sales, tails, scales and jails
Success before death
No one in my clique fails
As females with the almighty Father lead
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need
And it ain't no party like this kind
Cause you can leave your worries behizzind
But I'mma git back to the grizzind
Snoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and
I'm tha DoggFather

[Outro]
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy...
