[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Prince Royce, Big Snoop Dogg
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
(Que lo que mami)

[Verse 1: Prince Royce]
I like you talking dirty, I like your filthy love
You like the way I hold you, when we are falling in love
(Yo sé que si) in love
(Mami yo sé que si) if it's love
Then I don't want to come back up

Girl I know you're a handful
Cause you know what you like
You might be hard to handle
But I'mma show you tonight
(Pero que rica estas) tonight
(Que rica estas) what it's like when you're

[Chorus: Prince Royce]
Stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop
Once ain't enough
Better lock this down
Better box it up
Gotta work me out
Make it real
Gotta make it count
Get stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop
Once ain't enough
Better lock this down
Better box it up
Gotta work me out
Make it real
Gotta make it count
Get stuck on a feeling

(Dímelo mami)

Stuck on a feeling
Check it out

[Verse 2: Prince Royce]
Let's go hide out in private
Won't you show me your place
A little peace and quiet
Where we can both misbehave, misbehave
It's okay, it's okay, when you're

[Chorus: Prince Royce]
Stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop
Once ain't enough
Better lock this down
Better box it up
Gotta work me out
Make it real
Gotta make it count
Get stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop
Once ain't enough
Better lock this down
Better box it up
Gotta work me out
Make it real
Gotta make it count
Get stuck on a feeling

What, what, what?
(Ven conmigo mami)
Stuck on a feeling

[Bridge: Prince Royce & Snoop Dogg]
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a, she got me, she got

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Wheelin' and dealin, appealin, I'm realin'
Ya still in love with me, all green
I'm at it, romantic
No panic, organic
Slide right next to me, in ecstasy
Now who could ever make you feel like I felt
You're laying on your bed, just...
You're moaning and groaning
You're squirming and squealing
Guess it's true, I left you

[Chorus: Prince Royce]
Stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop
Once ain't enough
Better lock this down
Better box it up
Gotta work me out
Make it real
Gotta make it count
Get stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop
Once ain't enough
Better lock this down
Better box it up
Gotta work me out
Make it real
Gotta make it count
Get stuck on a feeling

[Bridge: Prince Royce & Snoop Dogg)
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
Stuck on a feeling
She got me
Yeah, yeah, she got me, she got me
Yeah, yeah, she got me, she got me
Stuck on a, stuck on a, stuck on a, stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
