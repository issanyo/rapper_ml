One of these days you gon' see me
But I've been right here all the time
(Hey, hey, hey)

You gonna reach out to touch me
But I won't be there by your side
(Nah, nah, nah)

You gonna wish you could drink me
Thirsty like the desert ground
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But I won't know how you're feeling, no
Cause I won't be anywhere around
(Bet you'll never forget)

Ooh, all this good loving I gave to you
(Bet you'll never forget)
Oh, all you ever did was lie, baby I was the truth
(You'll never forget)
Those times you said I would be nothing
(You'll never forget)
Boy, look at me, ain't I somethin'?

You know you want it but you know can't have nothing but a seat
Ah, ooh, ooh, ooh
You want this good good but you know
You can't have nothing but a seat
And watch the show

I think I like the security, yeah
Look who's incognito now
(Hey, hey, hey)
I bet right now if I called ya
You'd be ready to settle down
(Oh, hell yeah)
'One of those days' is here now
(Ooh, ooh)
So open up your eyes and ears
(Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause Stevie Wonder can see me
So I know I make myself clear, yeah

You know you want it but you know can't have nothing but a seat
No
You want this good good but you know
You can't have nothing but a seat
Nothing
Sit down and watch the show

Man to woman
Woman to man
No need to sit, I'm takin' a stand
Baby, come close let me hold your hand
I love En Vogue, I'm ya biggest fan
What he puttin' ya through?
See I can upgrade ya, that's what you
Want me to do?
And he had the nerve
Point blank, miss lady, you deserve
To be treated like a queen
I'm a king and I know how
All hail, that's how it goes down
His loss, my gain
Now you my thing
Here we go
There we go
To a place, just us
Have a little taste
Not here to take up ya time
I be right here when ya make up ya
Mind

I know it's hard to watch, cause I'm so
Freakin' hot (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bet ya girlfriend dresses just like me
But you'll never come close chick, have a seat

I know it's hard to watch, cause I'm so
Freakin' hot (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bet ya girlfriend dresses just like me
But you'll never come close chick, have a seat
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I bet you'll never forget

Ooh, all this good loving I gave to you
(You'll never forget)
Oh, all you ever did was lie, baby I was the truth
(You'll never forget)
Those times you said I would be nothing
(You'll never forget)
Boy, look at me, ain't I somethin'?

You know you want it but you know can't have nothing but a seat
