[Intro]
A yes sir, radio station, BUSH69 when you're down
Take me to the streets, shout out to the people out there in the city living that life
We 'bout to get off into that brand new Snoop Dogg produced by Pharrell
So everybody in the city tonight, I want to you roll your window down and turn the music up loud, enjoy
Radio station BUSH69, holdin it down

[Verse 1]
Grab your money, we're getting out this neighbourhood
Milk and honey, we're gonna burn up Hollywood, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Beach of Fortune and the neon sky
You know while back with us will be gold tonight
That's what they told us and they must be right, so let's ride
They built this city for you and me yeah

[Chorus]
Snooooooop
They built this city for you and me yeah
Snooooooop
They built this city for you and me yeah
Snooooooop
They built this city for you and me yeah
Snooooooop

[Verse 2]
Champagne wishes, taste like American pie (American pie)
Rags to riches, you never know unless you try (know unless you try)

[Pre-Chorus]
Beach of Fortune and the neon sky
You know while back with us will be gold tonight
That's what they told us and they must be right, so let's ride
They built this city for you and me yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All day wanna play, wanna rock with her
All day, every day on the block with her
My city, oh really be popping huh?
64s, hip hop and locking up
We changed the lane, remained the bain
Little bit of joy with a lot of pain
Is he Snoop Lion or Doggy mayne?
Ask me again, I tell you the same
DO Dubb with the key to the city
Me and P, we go DYD
Rip down, put my foot down
And if I'm in your town then I got to get down
Fight nights in Vegas
Bright lights we made it
Slayed it, slightly faded
Californicated and highly motivated

[Chorus]
Snooooooop
They built this city for you and me yeah
Snooooooop
They built this city for you and me yeah
Snooooooop
They built this city for you and me yeah
Snooooooop
They built this city for you and me yeah
