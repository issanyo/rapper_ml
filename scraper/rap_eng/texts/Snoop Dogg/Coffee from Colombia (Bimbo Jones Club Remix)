Give me all you got to I
Give me all you got to I
Give me all you got to I have control

Baby, I wake up and I need it
I taste it
You make me go crazy
Give me all your body and give me all your soul
Give me all you got to I have control
Give me all your body and give me all your soul
Give me all you got to I have control
