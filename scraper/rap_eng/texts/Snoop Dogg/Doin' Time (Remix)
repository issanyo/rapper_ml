G-Boy and the B-Boy stance
Coming with dah wicked

Top selector (Come with the wickedness)

[Hook]
Summertime and the living's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G
Our people in the dance will agree that we're
Well qualified to represent the L.B.C
Me, me and Louie, we gon'
Run to the party, dance to the rhythm that gets harder

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, D-O-Double G
From the strong beach, the wrong beach
The Long Beach

[Verse 1: Bradley Nowell]
Me and my girl
We got this relationship
I love her so bad
But she treats me like
On lock down like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over and when she gets home
There's none left for me

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
Snoop D-O-Double G
From the strong beach, the wrong beach
Fool, the Long Beach

[Verse 2: Bradley Nowell]
Oh, take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun will someday rise
What am I gonna be doin' for a while?
Said I'm gonna play with myself
Show them now how we'vecome off the shelf
So what

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
Snoop D-O-Double G all

[Bridge: Bradley Nowell]
Evil, I've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely
Evil, ornery, scandalous, and evil
Most definately
The tension is getting hotter
I'd like to hold her head underwater

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Summertime on the grind, still down for mine
Ain't no quittin', hard hittin' with the homie Sublime
Worldwide, small world, boy, girl, you got to deal with this
Precious in your profession, we're stressin', that's the lesson
I don't practice Santeria, but I'm a G
Comin' from that mad ass L.B.C
Three, two, one
One, two, three
We all qualified to represent the L.B.C

[Outro: Bradley Nowell]
Take a tip, take a tip
Take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G
Our people in the dance will agree that we
Well qualified to represent the L.B.C
Me, la-la Louie
While everybody run to the party
Run to the rhythm, it gets harder

[Snoop Dogg]
Snoop D-O-Double G
From the Long Beach, the wrong beach
Yeah, the strong beach

[Snoop Dogg]
Snoop D-O-Double G, back
BLAH! Coming with dah wickedness, top selector
Sublime, the L.B.C.'s finest

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, yeah, y'all
That's how we doing it til the '97
Comin' at you in all kind of angles
Snoop D-O-Double G, A.K.A. Tha Doggfather
Doin' it to ya Doggystyle
With the homeboys from the L.B.C Sublime
Ha ha, yeah, yeah, y'all
Just when you thought it was over
