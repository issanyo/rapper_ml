Snoop Dogg (Intro)
Ayo Chief
Got some of that shit for me?
Yea, that real shit

Snoop Dogg (Verse)
When I wake up in the morning I be blowed
When I’m driving down the streets I be blowed
I mean everywhere I go like, if I do a show like
Everybody owe me, I’m the big macaroni
I turn it up, burn it up, rockin this bitch
Bag full of goodies like my boy Saint Nick
Cranberry mix with the great goo spiff
Put it in the air, nigga light that shit
Baby girl bring a few friends back
You fuckin with a real California mack
Like this, like that, I’mma show you where it at
Act right, kick rocks, bitch this hip-hop
Down in the T.O., do it like a G.O
My mama call me Snoopy but my friends call me Leo
Yes, I’m an indian
Two braids in my hair with a pipe in my hand
I’m endin all the big beefs, rolling up the big leafs
Sittin on my blown in the zone with the big chief
Hip-hopper, rapper dapper
Til the one that a real bitch slapper
Ya did?

Snoop Dogg (Hook)
I got my blunt in my right hand, lighter in my left
Blowin like a motherfucker, doin it to death
Gotta stay blowed, yes I gotta stay high
Big Snoop Dogg bitch, look up in the sky
It’s the number one smoker, Top Gun with the fire
Blowin on that kush so you know I get ya higher
Roll it up, light it up, pass it to kin folk
Everybody smoke bomb weed til we getting blowed

Chief (Verse)
Doggy Doggy, Chief, I’m with the number one chief rocka
Break down the dutch and roll the leaf proper
Women all around me, it is so astounding
Your pussy make oceans, most men will be drowning
Me? I handle that, wheelbarrow camel back
Your relation, never got it, when I’m done I get up out it
Me I’m native, American royalty
So she feel obligated to spoil me
Man that’s kush in my peace pipe
Shorty lucky ‘cus I’m not the chief type
No, I spent a rack for a zip of it
Unravel the bag baby, you should take a whiff of it
And let’s get blowed, the sex is so majestic yo
The best lit dro
You can smell it straight through the pipes
To get awake Bob Marley up out of his casket

Snoop Dogg (Hook)
I got my blunt in my right hand, lighter in my left
Blowin like a motherfucker, doin it to death
Gotta stay blowed, yes I gotta stay high
Big Snoop Dogg bitch, look up in the sky
It’s the number one smoker, Top Gun with the fire
Blowin on that kush so you know I get ya higher
Roll it up, light it up, pass it to kin folk
Everybody smoke bomb weed til we getting blowed

Chief (Verse)
Eventually I might have to hit the dispensary
Buy a couple pounds, I’ll be high for a century
Soon as I step in the DJ mention me
I walk by yo bitch, the ho stop pinchin me
She said, Chief uh, is that reefer?
Can you smoke with me and my girl Minka?
We got weed but ours is a lot cheaper
Two puffs of this and you’ll be screaming go deeper
No need for a small talk, let’s break the ice
I would love to have sex but head will suffice
I’m tryna get blowed
Whether it’s the weed or felatio
Your ass is so fantastic ho
K-killin them bitches call the casket hoes
Even though you sexy please pass the dro
While you bounce that ass on my dick real slow

Snoop Dogg (Hook)
I got my blunt in my right hand, lighter in my left
Blowin like a motherfucker, doin it to death
Gotta stay blowed, yes I gotta stay high
Big Snoop Dogg bitch, look up in the sky
It’s the number one smoker, Top Gun with the fire
Blowin on that kush so you know I get ya higher
Roll it up, light it up, pass it to kin folk
Everybody smoke bomb weed til we getting blowed
