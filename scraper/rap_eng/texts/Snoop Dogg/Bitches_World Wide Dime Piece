[Intro: Queen & Greg Nice]
Shit, ain't nothin' wrong with fuckin' with a nigga from the East Coast
Ain't nothin' wrong with gettin' a lil' piece of the East (no doubt!)
You know I stayed on the West Coast
And I'm the queen with the most
I fuck with the East Coast niggas
(Hey baby, hey baby I'm from the East Coast
I recognize I'm from the East Coast )
And that's for damn sure
And I just got a call from my man 'Pac, and we was talkin' about how we like to toss up
How we like our bitches ya know?
(Mm, hmm)
So uh I mean, I LOOOVE me some Cali pussy
Aight nigga you don't know nothin' 'bout Cali pussy though
(yeah yeah)
You couldn't possibly know 'bout this West shit right here

[Verse 1: Greg Nice]
Ugh ugh ugh ugh (shit check it out)
Yo, money don't grow on trees
Everybody talkin' bout they movin' ki's
Probably they gettin' dirt on they knees
No time for bull crap I got to get these
Soon as I step my feet up in the jam
Eyeballs on me wanna know who I am
Fail to realize, I'm the same man
Made it funky for you
With the pure blim blam
Uh a jelly fish, uh
You know I can't stand
Hung out with my crew, jerked more than a grand
Frontin' ass nigga ain't nothin' but a fan
I know we can make it yes, we can can
Greg N.I.C.E game playa get dough and buy land
Expand and help my brother man
Check me out y'all
A check me out y'all
A check me out
Check me out
A check me out y'all y'all

[Capital LS]
Let me lick you up!!
Let me lick you down!!
Well come on baby let me lick you all around
What do you do?

[Verse 2: Capital LS]
When the pussy leaves you stranded
9 times outta 10, I escape like the bandit
I took this slanted eyed bitch for granted
I couldn't understand it, the ass broke out like mass transit
I was wit' it 'cause she was with the Freaky Deaky
The Dicky Dicky equivalent to the Lickey Lickey
My mushy bushy was all up inside your gushy pussy (alright)
Hey yo yo you make sure she douchey douchey?
Without a doubt...
Yo I'll be all on top of that
My dick stays strapped with a top hat
I peeked your nipples, protrudin' from your negligee
And hey you say we can do this shit here everyday
Let's works this out like Jane Fonda
Over turkey lasagna, or we can take this to the back of the Honda
You need to feel warm nut on your breasts
Ain't nothin' fuckin' with them bitches (nah) from the West

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Eternally thug nigga, Hilfiger, made by Tommy
So when I speak hope to reach my Boricua mammies
Oh come to poppy, I love it when it's wet and sloppy
In and out the mouth piece, until I cum no one can stop me
My bump 'n' grind ll do ya every time
Come get a blast of this thug passion, it'll blow ya mind
Hey!! Throw up your legs, wrap them shits around my back
It's a West Side thing fuckin' hoes around the map
Walkin' down 125 while I'm peepin' out hotties
And they, seduce my Jimmie, I'll be screamin' give me body
Make 'em all scream my name out, give me my props
And don't ya, love how this thug nigga beat up the cop
I'm at the Rican parade, I'm watching caramel bitches play
Get with real niggas, bullshit will never get you paid
This is the dream of a young black team
I fiend for hoes cross country like a greedy crack fiend
Now come on

[Verse 4: Asu]
I get my shit off like clothes before sex
Steppin' to bitches like Gore-Tex, matter fact your next
On the agenda
So I'ma send a fuckin' head if ya say the wrong sentence
Sprint like long distance
Hit some laps baby, I'm bustin' raps baby
Chillin' with them niggas that's fuckin' peelin' caps baby
Mad love, bring your shoulders across through time zones
Try to catch a cyclone, you get ya mind blown
I show 'em how I attract, all shapes and sizes
All eyes is on whatever makes it rises
Once she come through, I'ma show ya just what lumber do
You got a man, I'll be ya pencil in ya number 2
It's all the same wherever you go
Hoes is hoes, foes is foes, pros is pros, yeah y'all niggas know
From East to West it's all the same
Once they hit the mattress bitches catchin' dyslexia screamin' my name
Backwards
Usa, Usa ohh

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Ain't that so
Umm
Now I dun been around the world
And aye ya ya

And I can't deny
I had some bitches in New York
Some Puerto Rican bitches
Puerto Ricco
Hey
