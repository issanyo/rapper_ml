[Intro]
What it was, fool, what it used to be
It's the Planes and the Taylor Gang
Bitches sliding off they wedding rings
Uncork the champagne, she just wanna ride with a G

[Hook]
She remember what it was
She remember what it used to be
But somewhere along the lines
She fucked up and realized she lost her seat and now
She just wanna ride with a G
She just wanna ride with a G

[Verse 1]
Fresh out the time machine, I step
Mercedes Benz SL5, garage kept
I play the field with stiff arms and side steps
Bitches with whom I've slept solidify my rep
Her baby doll eyes watered up, as she wept
When I mention my intentions were to step
Beast I be, her friends tell her not to speak to me
We've got history, I know I still can beat
Fool, and women I've been with know it's true
No matter what I got going, saw me with my mang thang
Still got my number she texting my phone
She just wanna ride with a G
I can't knock her for fucking with these imposters
Lower case G's, little me's
Them niggas picking sticks and seeds outta they weed
My bud covered in fuzz but not surrounded by the police

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Playa, play ya, lay ya, spray ya
On the real, loco, I should be the mayor
Compassionate writer, fly to a spider
Scope on me tough like a sniper, viper
My cipher is G's, no fleas, green trees
No seeds, oh please, we press, we ease
Artistically in a midst of me, I'm mystically and magical
The weight I form the group
Makes a move I mean, cause my shit is like classical
It blows my mind and I know, this new diamond I quote
It's worth about a mil ticket, baby, is ya down to come get it?
Cause my seat is unoccupied
West coast living, is you down to ride?
We can take ya to the spot maybe, but it's hot baby
From the bottom all the way to the top, baby
You with the Boss Dogg, that it is
See I'm 'bout the currency with urgency, can ya dig?

[Hook]
