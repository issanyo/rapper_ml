SN-O-OP thats me kinda hard being Snoop Do-g-g but somehow some way keep coming up making those chicks like every single day
Got so much ladys in the place to be kinda hard being Snoop Do-g-g but somehow some way keep coming up making those chicks like every single day

Now, I could make miracles to tempos
It's instrumental, waiting for the nymphos; that's the intro
Shook when you rush me, walked up and touched me
Why? Do you want to fuck me?
Just â€˜cause I'm paid in the worst way? True!
Lookin' kinda good in your birthday suit
I wonder if you're wild and you act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch when you lick your lips shake your hips got damn i love that shit, Yo, let's stop fakin', be real now
I got a room and a hard-on; still down?
Met you standing at a bar full of black dudes
Said you wanna see my scars and my tattoos
When we head for my hideout, act right
Boss player when I ride out, that's right
What's ya phone number?

Lights, camera, action, show-time
We bust shit back in no time
Yo kind can't fuck with my kind
You must be losin' yo mind
Lights, camera, action, show-time
We bust shit back in no time
Yo kind can't fuck with my kind
You must be losin' yo mind

Oh shit, baby is a dime piece, more than just fine
She's personally blessed from the gods
If I seen her right now, she could get me hard
Didn't want to talk to me, just to see my car
Never had sex with a rich rap star
'Til I got her in the back of my homeboy's car
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches, let me hear you say
What's your phone number?
Are you alone? Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone!
Time for your girlfriend to take you home
I had fun, but baby, gotta leave me alone
Picture in my rhyme
Take time to rewind these words I say
If you open your mind bet in a minute you'll find
It's time let the Outlawz play

Lights, camera, action, show-time
We bust shit back in no time
Yo kind can't fuck with my kind
You must be losin' yo mind
Lights, camera, action, show-time
We bust shit back in no time
Yo kind can't fuck with my kind
You must be losin' yo mind

We still rhime tho
