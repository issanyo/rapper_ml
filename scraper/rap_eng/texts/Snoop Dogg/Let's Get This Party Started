[Intro: Snoop]
Awww Yeah

Now this is what I want
I want everybody on the dancefloor
No wallflowers
If you came to sit down, uh-uh
You only in here if you came to get down

[Hook: Snoop]
Y'all want this party started right?
Y'all want this party started quickly

[Verse 1: Azure]
I see you looking at me, baby don't be shy
Won't you come holler at me
We can take this party over to the dancefloor
Cause this beat is bangin' and I just can't ignore
The way you make my heart jump 1-2-3
I know you felt it, made you wanna just wanted to party
So I'ma tell you what to do

[Bridge: Azure]
Get outta your seat and head to the dancefloor
Get outta your seat and head to the dancefloor
Keep watching me oh-oh

Get outta your seat and head to the dancefloor
Get outta your seat and head to the dancefloor

[Hook: Snoop]

[Verse 2: Azure]
Coming in [?] like "damn who is she?"

'07 is our year and we came to get this party started
So ready for the lights, camera, action
Only wanna give you musical satisfaction
Now I'm tell you what to do

[Bridge: Azure]
Get outta your seat and head to the dancefloor
Get outta your seat and head to the dancefloor
Keep watching me oh-oh

Get outta your seat and head to the dancefloor
Get outta your seat and head to the dancefloor
