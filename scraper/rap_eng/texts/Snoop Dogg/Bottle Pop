[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Tip top, drip drop
Bottles pop, lips lock
Hips rock, don't stop
Big Snoop Dogg is back on the block
PC, Disney
Shake that thing to this beat
Taste like Brandi, shaped like Landi
Sweet like candy, candy, candy

[Middle 8: The Pussycat Dolls]
All them other models bottling like mama's bottle tasty
If you pop my bottle, all them models gonna hate me

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls]
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me

[Verse 2: The Pussycat Dolls]
Every girl dreams of herself in pearls
Wanna be the fast driver of a shiny car
But the good girls suddenly the bad girls
Just because they wanna be a movie star

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls]
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me

[Verse 3: The Pussycat Dolls]
Every girl feels this world belongs to her
No matter who make her purr, she's a superstar
Never worry; there’s us, my girl with curves
That’ll make this mutha burn when her bottle pops

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls]
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Pass the fifth, I pass it back
Turn around lil mama, got ass in the back
See, it's a fact, a bottle of pop
If you shake it, then drop it like it's hot
Time is money and money is time
And if you're with me, all your money is mine
Yup, yup, do it to deaf
Is it true that you get wet? (Wet, wet)

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls]
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me

[Bridge: The Pussycat Dolls]
You're turning me on
You're shaking me up
So don'tcha wanna take me
Just because
I'm the chosen one
All them models gonna hate me

[Middle 8: The Pussycat Dolls]
All them other models bottling like mama's bottle tasty
If you pop my bottle, all them models gonna hate me

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls]
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me

[Break: The Pussycat Dolls]
When my bottle pop, shake me

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls]
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me
