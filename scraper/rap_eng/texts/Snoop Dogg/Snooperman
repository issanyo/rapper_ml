[Intro]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
No that's... Snooperman

[Verse 1]
I said some pimp juice
I lay low to get loose
Word on the streets is Doggy Dogg got the goose
On the moon
Cause he got a lot to prove
He never tasted the fever this one he gon' lose
On the deuce
I once wanted the truce
But fuck that, this nigga think he bulletproof
I can't talk him, so I brought chalk to him
I had the lame on the asphalt, bitch nigga ask how
DPGC, L-O-N-G-B-E-A-C-H
Is the only way that we play
I catch a nigga by the collar
Act like we need to holler
I let you slide when you fuck me up the million dollars
Bought me a bitch, a house and a Impala
And that they call me top dollar

[Hook]
I do like I do it, can't nobody do it like I can
I'm Snooperman
Look up in the sky, real high like a bird so I'm fly
I'm Snooperman
I do like I do it, can't nobody do it like I can
I'm Snooperman

[Verse 2]
It was December 18th seven days before Christmas
I was at the pad putting together my wish list
Back then I mean my game was so vicious
I had to shoot a nigga, just cause he was on bitch shit
I mean it seemed so senseless
But I'm a superhero so my life is relentless
Biting rhymes nah, I be biting grinds
And fucking niggas up accross of the line
Flying through the sky like a bird off that purple light
You niggas can't wait for me to turn it out
I flip a style, crip a while, gon' honey child
Ran up about a hundred miles
Threw about a hundred styles
You can check my file I'm the one and only
I make records for the girls and the lil homies

[Hook]
I do like I do it, can't nobody do it like I can
I'm Snooperman
Look up in the sky, real high like a bird so I'm fly
I'm Snooperman
I do like I do it, can't nobody do it like I can
I'm Snooperman

[Interlude]
Wow Snooperman is totally awesome
I used to wanna be Batman, The Incredible Hulk
Spiderman fuck them
I wanna be Snooperman
He is the greatest superhero of all time
I love you Snooperman, you're the greatest
Woah Snooperman my hero

[Hook]
I do like I do it, can't nobody do it like I can
I'm Snooperman
Look up in the sky, real high like a bird so I'm fly
I'm Snooperman
I do like I do it, can't nobody do it like I can
I'm Snooperman
