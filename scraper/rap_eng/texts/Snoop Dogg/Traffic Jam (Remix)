[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Snoop D.O. Double from the L.B.C
Smoke so much ganja them call me Marley
Everytime you see me I'm out the country
Police want to cuff me but them can't touch me
Pull me to the curb they say they smell herb
Why your car swerved? Now the ghetto birds
Swoopin down tryin to clown but it was never found
Now I gotta post bail five hundred thou'
Small change it's a small thang to a boss man
For my freedom I need 'em I'm a tell ya, it's all gain
That's why I got a license Loc
They say I can't do nothin but smoke over the counter dope
Yeah, if you love to smoke, put your blunts in the air and say dope, dope, dope
Yeah, we doin this now
With Snoop and Stephen, Damian came with ym crew with a style
Bow wow!!! (Bow wow!!!) When it hit yo' block
It don't matter nephew cause the shit don't stop
You try to, jam up the traffic it's drastic and pornographic
I'm mackin, mappin and crackin I stack it, pack it and wrap it

[Verse 2: Stephen Marley]
Alright! This is Raggamuffin from the ghetto youths camp
Anywhere we go we say we must leave we stamp
Marijuana weh mi smoke dem seh too ignorant
Just di odda day some popo a hold me fi one
Then my brother Juju and my Idren name Dan
Bounce and listen to Gong when mashin up di traffic jam
Police pull mi ova talkin bout him smell grand
Mi look inna him face I know this bwoy have a plan
Juju touch mi pon my shoulda seh di bwoy a demon
First ting him waan to know is where dat smell is comin from
Are you smokin marijuana and I said yes I am
Smokin marijuana and I said, yah mon
Gimme some herb and mek it burn, on di table mek it turn
All dem a talk dem still caan learn
Dat come off to di well concerned
Know that the sensi strong and firm
Gimme the herb and keep your food
Watch the paper watch the news
That ah what we gonna choose?

[Hook: Stephen Marley]

[Verse 3: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley]
Well if ah ganja them ah look for them know where to find us
We deh inna di club wid we woman a wine up
Fi dem medical marijuana everybody a sign up
And form a union di herbalist a join up
In under, darkness it grows, bright and expose
Left your contacts at home just, follow your nose
I feel good and I said goodness knows
That's not just as far as the goodness goes
It's a great stimulant help my meal settle
When I boil a few buds in my tea kettle
And this will open up a cancer patient's appetitte
Feed up and get well and live a happy life
But now them jealous because I burn with Snoop
And now them jealous because it smell like fruits
Please don't tell me that your jealous cause we got alot of love
From all the real cops and troops
Hey! More paper for the acre, more paper for Jamaica
Gong and Snoop Dogg and Muffin melody major
Now him jealous cause everybody knows us
Now him jealous cause everybody shows love
Cause a philly where you pass and them ah smile and ah blush
Through see some man ah star them truly have a light crush
Now him jealous now even twice as much
Now di bwoy jealous now even twice as much
It's just a minor set back ah who yuh want cold up?
Every month end the super get a thing fold up
Say natty dread no wear handcuffs
Seh any kind a cuff it haffi diamond cuff
Go tell them every month end the super get a thing fold up
Go tell dem seh natty dreadlocks nah wear handcuffs
Easy papa muffin yuh ruffa than ruff
Settle Juju Royal yuh tuffa than tuff
Always stick togetha even when time tuff
A which fassy bright and him go shine and, Settle!!! Settle!!!
