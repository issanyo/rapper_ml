[Intro]
Hey, hey, the youth dem, ey ey, hey, Snoop Lion

[Chorus]
She wanna be my mind never make it through the youth dem
The youth dem, they watching so be careful how you do them
I said the youth dem, the youth dem
They know it, it don't matter, you can't fool them
Them youth dem just wanna turn up, turn up just wanna turn up
Turn up, suga, shots, turn up

[Verse 1 - Snoop]
I'm back again, I'm happening, it's your favourite rapper friend
Though I'd never rap again, I changed my style and mastered it
Life is what you make it and I just left your make up
And I feel right at home cause I been smoking my Jamacian
Said it's time again the rapper's it
Yeah and I'm from outter excellence
No substitute for intelligence, no room for embellishments
I run the game like I'm referee, for 20 years still repping it

[Chorus]
Yes lord, them youth dem just wanna turn up, turn up
Just wanna turn up
Turn up, suga, shots
The youth dem, the youth dem, they watching so be careful how you do them
I said the youth dem, the youth dem, they know it, it don't matter you can't fool them
Them youth dem just wanna turn up, turn up
One time for my first time, and my last time cause I ain't felt this good in a long time
