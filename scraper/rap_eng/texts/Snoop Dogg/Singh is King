[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yo what up
This is Big Snoop Dogg
Represent that Punjabi
Ay yo, hit 'em with this
R-D-B, D-P-G-C, Akshay, and Snoop D-O-double G
Oh yeah, Singh is King, this is the thing
Do you know what I mean
Follow me, listen to me for a second, check it
Singh is the King
Check the records

[Verse 1: RDB]
Yaari hai jaan ehna di
Vakhri hai shaan ehna di
Hasna pehchaan ehna di
Taiyo hai duniya kehndi
Yaari hai jaan ehna di
Vakhri hai shaan ehna di
Hasna pehchaan ehna di
Sab milke kehnde ne

[Hook]
Singh is king
Hun har koi jaane
Singh is king
Duniya de raaje

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Ferraris, Bugattis, and Maseratis
Snoop D O double G, the life of the party
Lay back, stay back, I'm in the Maybach
This ain't James Brown, but it's the big payback
Watch me zoom by, make it boom by
What up to all the ladies hanging out in Mumbai
Cheese makes dollars, east west masala
Singh is the King so you all have to follow
Iâ€™m tryna stack my butter
I'm tryna get this ?

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 3: Akshay Kumar]
Singh soormay rakhde ne aan
Kade lorh payi te de denge jaan
Raaje Maharaje vi karde si maan
Rakhdi si pug uchi bande di shaan
Jo Singhan ne keetiyan kurbaniyan ne
Oh duniya te chhad gaye nishaniyan ne
Duniya de ban gaye Singh badshah
Par sab to ucha oh Sacha Paatshah

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, I'm just a king
Sitting on my throne all alone
Can you dig what I'm saying
Bring some grapes over here baby
Singh is king
And Snoop DO double G is also the king
You dig what I mean
Diamonds on my finger, diamonds on my toes, yeah
Real cool like
