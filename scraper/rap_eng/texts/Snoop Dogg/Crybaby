[Intro: Snoop Dogg & (Mariah Carey)]
Yo, what's that?
What you crying for?
Now you know you look to damn good to be crying
(Do-do-do, yeah-yeah)
Come here, holla at a playa
DPG style, you know, you know

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
When I think of our untimely end
And everything we could have been
I cry, baby I cry

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey & (Snoop Dogg)]
Okay, so it's five AM and I still can't sleep
Took some medicine, but it's not working
Someone's clinging to me and it's bittersweet
'Cause he's head over heels, but it ain't that deep
I finally changed my number, got a different pager
Then last Saturday your cousin called
To say you're trying to reach me
Probably because you see that I'm with someone new (what?)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Snoop Dogg)]
Late at night like a little child
Wandering 'round alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know
I still cry baby, over you and me
(Baby, don't cry)

[Verse 3 : Mariah Carey & (Snoop Dogg)]
Sipping Bailey's Cream, by the stereo (Yeah, yeah)
Trying to find relief on the radio (Ah, what's up?)
I'm suppressing the tears
But they start to flow
'Cause the next song I hear is the song I wrote
When we first got together early that September
I can't bear to listen, so I might as well drift
In the kitchen pour another glass or two
And try to forget you (Ya know, ya know)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Snoop Dogg)]
Late at night like a little child
Wandering 'round alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes (baby, don't cry) so that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me
(Baby, don't cry)

[Verse 4 : Snoop Dogg]
Baby, hear me when I say
"Let that man be on his way"
Don't even waste your time
And worry 'bout how he handle things
Baby, hear me when I say
"A playa feeling good today"
You know you're too fly to even waste your time
Watch how I handle things
Man, you's a fool for this
But on the real dog, I'm cool with this
We doing this
D-O double G Z-Y
Kiss the girls and make them cry

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Snoop Dogg)]
Late at night like a little child (Dry your eyes)
Wandering 'round alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know
I still crybaby over you and me (Baby, don't cry)
Late at night like a little child
Wandering 'round alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know
I still crybaby over you and me (Baby, don't cry)

[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
I don't get no sleep
I'm up awake
Can't stop thinking of you and me
And everything we used to be
It could have been so perfect
Still I cry, I cry, I cry
Oh, I gotta get me some sleep
Baby and I cry, cry, cry, cry
Baby and I cry, cry, cry, cry

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Snoop Dogg)]
Late at night like a little child
Wandering 'round alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know
I still crybaby over you and me
(Baby, don't cry)
Late at night like a little child
Wandering 'round alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know
I still crybaby over you and me
(Baby, don't cry)

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
Baby, and I cry, cry, cry, cry
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Baby and I...
