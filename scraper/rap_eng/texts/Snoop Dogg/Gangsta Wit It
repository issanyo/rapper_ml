We can get gangsta wit it
Get gangsta wit it
We can get gangsta wit it
Get gangsta wit it
We can get gangsta wit it
Get gangsta wit it

[Butch Cassidy]
Tell me can ya bust one line, tight as mine
Get the bullshit up in mine, it's my time to shine
Man I never felt this way, I hope it doesn't go away
I won't have to display, the dopest shit I ever could say
Never shall I meet defeat, so why should anyone compete
I keep my shit true to the streets, check me as I'm rockin' the beat
I got chu' on cruise control, head bobbin' whether young or old
Let me take over ya soul, so you can listen why the story is told

[Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
We can get gangsta wit it (Gangsta, gangsta)
Get gangsta wit it (Gangsta, gangsta)
We can get gangsta wit it (Stay gangsta)
Get gangsta wit it (Gangsta, gangsta)
We can get gangsta wit it (Gangsta, gangsta)
Get gangsta wit it (Gotta stay gangsta)
We can get gangsta wit it, (Gangsta, gangsta)
Get gangsta wit it (Gangsta)

[Snoop Dogg]
Gangsta blues with a gangsta ooze
A whole bunch of gangstas followin' gangsta rules
Baby girl tryin' to bring a gangsta some booze
I over-heard her tellin' Dogg can't out drank them fools
Bring it to me, shit I ain't got nothin' to lose
Just make sure you don't spill it on my Stacy Adams' shoes
Bad bitches usually run in twos
And gangsta niggas usually run in crews
Now take this for example, if Eve bit the apple
Would the police still gap em', pass em'
Now put him on a lasso
And keep my foot out his motherfucking asshole
For all the abuse and the wrongful bookings
Dr. King and Malcolm X good lookin'
Never will I ever forget the shit that I been through
The shit that y'all went through, I'mma keep it gangsta

[Nate Dogg]
We can get gangsta wit it
Get gangsta wit it
We can get gangsta wit it
Get gangsta wit it
We can get gangsta wit it
Get gangsta wit it
