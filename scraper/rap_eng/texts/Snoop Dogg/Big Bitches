[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I like big bitches cause they so large
Big bitches always take charge
Wanna grab a slim nigga like Snoop Dogg
Cause they say that I'm skinny and tall
But a big bitch gets shit that a nigga need
Always got the drink and somethin' on the weed
And I never have a muthafuckin' need no more
And every nigga that I know done fucked a fat-ass hoe, so

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
But, uh, I'm that nigga who gon' kick the reals
And, uh, big bitches this is how I feels
See ain't no reason for the Dogg to lie
I like it when they weigh about two-o-five
With all this shit goin' on nowadays
I'd rather have a big bitch cause she pays what she weighs
