[Intro: Snoop]
Yuh, ayo big Percy
Pour me a glass of that moet with some orange juice
Hand me my pimp glass
Ayo, lil P
Tell them bitches to come sit right next to me
Yeah, gotta story to tell

[Verse: Snoop]
I learned to G, how to C from L.O.C
And after that mac, mac I bought my first Cadillac
7-duece, 6 seat with the danglin' thangs
Long Beach is the city, 20 crip is the gang
You can hang if you wanna but I don't think you can last
Last week in the beach, the big homie got smashed
Tried to play the young homie, tried to take his cash
Didn't say too much, all I heard was blasts
Ask no questions in this profession
You gotta view the game at your own discretion
It's a cold game, my niggas stop guessing
Do the right thing cause I ain't giving no lessons
Smokin' that stress got ya stressin'
Take that frown of yo' face and stick yo' chest in
Unless ya plan on restin'
Cause I'm the wrong nigga to be pressin' or testin'
I'm a east side nigga and I just don't care
I step up in this bitch, they say "that nigga's a playa"
I might change the game, go and cut my hair
You niggas say I'm back but I ain't went nowhere (he's back)
Hell yeah I'm there
At a crip clux clan meeting, family affair
Standing on stage, bout to do that there
I need to be the governor (yes ya can)
I keep a dark one, a light one, a fat one, a tight one
I'm always lookin' for the right one
Chinese, Japanese, Lebanese on ya knees
Shit you know me, I leave with either one of these
Vietnamese, Philippines, pick a niece, yo' niece
And will we still be homies
If I hit it and get it, quit it
Nah I stay committed, forget it
Cause I know in the end you gon' wanna fight again
So, I'd rather fuck with this all whitey then
Green eyes, blue eyes, yo' eyes
Her eyes bring me the money, I'll just split the pita
You just make it, shake it, I take it
Throw it in the oven, take my time and bake it
It's amazin' how they act when you get naked
I'm so in love with the game and I just can't fake it
Can't take it

[Hook: Snoop]
I just can't take it
I just can't fake it
I just can't take it no more
I need paper and that's no lie
Blaze my dough-dough until I die
I say I just can't take it
I just can't fake it
I just can't take it no more
I need (dough-dough) and that's no lie
I blaze that dough-dough until I die

[Outro: Snoop]
What sweet sounds
Of Meech-a-rooni
Inside the dogg house
For the 2000 plus 2
Can you dig it?
This is some of that A-B-C R-I-P ooh-wee
I mean, you could put a chocolate wrap around that
And put a lighter on the end of it
Cause that's all foggy
Can you dig it?
I smell you Meech-a-rooni
Ugh
