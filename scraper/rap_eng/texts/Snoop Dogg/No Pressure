It's Classified baby
[Chorus: Dave Sampson and (Classified)]
It's the weekend
On the East Coast
Got a little crazy last night
Woke up in the back seat
Of a row boat
No clothes, no phone, comatose
(You ready? Yeah!)
I guess I dove off
Of the deep end
Now I'm just paying the price
High cost of living
Guess you get what you give in
No pressure no diamonds
No-no pressure, no
No-no pressure, no
No-no pressure, no diamonds
No-no pressure, no
No-no pressure, no
No-no pressure, no diamonds

[Verse 1: Classified]
This is for the rogue soldier, dope smoker and home-owner
Show closer, show boater and stone thrower
Party people and the people staying home sober
This is for the ones who give me love, and the cold shoulder
I do this for the low-rollers and the YOLO-ers
Go-getters and the Monday morning no-showers
This is for the high-rollers, with no chauffeurs
And the ones who ain't got nothing to hide, like comb-overs
Take a spiced rum, with a little cold soda
I'm the giving type - organ and bone donor
You can feel the pressure building as you grow older
Grind hard, yeah I told ya
This is for the

[Chorus: Dave Sampson]
Weekend
On the West coast
Got a little crazy last night
Woke up in the back seat
Of a row boat
No clothes, no phone, comatose
I guess I dove off
Of the deep end
Now I'm just paying the price
High cost of living
Guess you get what you give in
No pressure, no

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg and (Classified)]
Fresher than fresh
Yes I'm the best
No pressure nonetheless -
One might contest
Until they figure out
This nigga 'bout -
Knockin' the bitch
Gettin' this brick
Taking a trip
And having a sip
I made your girl want to skinny dip
When she seen me
Rub my nuts three times, made your bitch a genie
She made my dick disappear then reappear, do it down
Gave it to her best friend, lube it down
See I don't even know where I'm at (but we smokin'!)
Somewhere in Nova Scotia, Canada, bustin' the mack
You see
Pimpin' ain't got no restrictions
I'm your DJ while I'm stayin' in the mixin'
Fixin' the batch
I woke up with a bad bitch in my lap, my nigga
Cause I'm cool like that
See it's a Monday, a fun day, and one day I'll quit
But until then, my nigga, we gon' just get lit

[Chorus: Dave Sampson and (Snoop Dogg)]
Cause  it's the weekend
On the West coast (West coast, baby!)
Got a little crazy last night
Woke up in the back seat
Of a row boat
No clothes, no phone, comatose
I guess I dove off
Of the deep end
Now I'm just paying the price
High cost of living
Guess you get what you give in
No pressure, no diamonds
No-no pressure, no
No pressure, no
No pressure, no diamonds
No-no pressure, no
No-no pressure, no
No pressure, no diamonds

[Verse 3: Classified]
Yeah
I know I'm gonna pay for this tomorrow
Cause tonight we going in - like a porno
And tonight we going hard - like a porno
And then we gonna eat out - or Digiorno
I'm worn out, with a sore throat, and hungover
I'm a train wreck, rain check, I done told ya
These late nights and early mornings soon gotta go
I guess I can't expect to hit the highs, and not the lows
I'll pick my battles - I ain't tryna do this every night
Trying to slow it down so I can party long as Betty White
No pain, no gain
No pressure, no diamonds
Let's grind all day for all my people surviving
Till

[Chorus: Dave Sampson and (Snoop Dogg)]
The weekend
On the East coast (East coast!)
Got a little crazy last night
Woke up in the back seat
Of a row boat
No clothes, no phone, comatose
I guess I dove off
Of the deep end
Now I'm just paying the price
High cost of living (high cost of living)
Guess you get what you give in
No pressure, no diamonds
No pressure, no
No-no pressure, no diamonds
No-no pressure, no
No-no pressure, no
No pressure no, no diamonds

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
I mean this is some Classified shit right here man
Big Snoop Dogg
Coming at you live and direct
Straight from the mother fucking West coast
Yeah, we in Nova Scotia
Dig that
It don't get no realer than this
I mean this is the realest it can get, man
This is realer than real - you feel that?
Get in the back and feel that
No pressure, no
You can smell it through the back
Ha ha ha ha ha
