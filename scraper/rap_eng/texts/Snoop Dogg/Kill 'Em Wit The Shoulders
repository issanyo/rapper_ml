[Intro]
Well alright y'all
Y'all know what it is
It's ya boy: Big Snoop Dogg
Yes sir
Shoutout to my homeboy Lil Duval
Cause Lil Duval...

When he hit the line like
Oh

[Hook]
Kill 'em with the shoulders (yeah)
Kill 'em with the shoulders
Kill 'em with the shoulders
Kill 'em with the shoulders
Kill 'em with the shoulders
Kill 'em with the shoulders

[Verse]
You put your hands to the side and go up and down
Then ya "ooh" to the groove when you move it around
It's not hard, it's cool when you're moving your hips
You can do it like that or you can do it like this
Everybody stand up and get it in
From the back to the front we ballin'
Fall back, damn baby girl, you all that
Snoop Dogg, Duval
Kill 'em with a roulette, kill 'em with the shoulders
Here we go, this that shit
That'll fill the whole block and light it up
But if you clean, synchronized dancing just like a routine
Look at momma, look at cuz, look at auntie, stay in ya lane, don't bump me
'Cause I'ma get this off, don't get too close 'cause I set this off
And take my crew and do what we do, and make a little dance for you
One two, three four... to all the party people
When I make that sound (woo woo) everybody breaks it down
Look back at it, stand tall
Little Duval, Big Snoop Dogg
Kill 'em with the Roller, 'nuff said, now kill 'em with the shoulders

[Hook]
Kill 'em with the shoulders
Kill 'em with the shoulders
Kill 'em with the shoulders
Kill 'em with the shoulders

Look back now, kill 'em with the shoulders
Kill 'em with the shoulders
Drop it down, now kill 'em with the shoulders
Kill 'em with the shoulders
Pick it up, now kill 'em with the shoulders
Kill 'em with the shoulders
Everybody in this bitch, kill 'em with the shoulders
