Look Big Snoop Dogg
Occupation real
Conversation skill show you how to make a mill'
Pimpin' cath me on tour
I headline the bill with beatufil bitches
I done been to brazil
Nigga, aks fo' real, my pockets is filled
Big money I'm the boss of my gangsta feel
They say they got the cure, well I ain't takin the pill
I'm a stillkeep the gangsta after fifteen years
Ya digg

Can't give it up gettin money the way that I live
The king of the west coast I'm runnin this shit
Big snoop dogg nigga you know what it is
The forty calli screw yo face like you fuckin with this

No cure for the cash nigga my pockets big
Kush weed is the best, so why would I quit
High flyin in the ??
I drop em down pick em up yes I am the pimp

What you thought, doggystyle all up in yo bitch
If theres a cure for getttin money theres the opposite
Never give it up, man I love this shit
Blunt after blunt, hit after hit
Six fo low ridin with the candy kidden
If theres a cure fo beein gangsta I dont want this shit

A mother fo the sunrise sposed to hit the block
Lil bad mothafucka pull the pockets pull the rocks
Learned to throw them thangs

Let me tell you why they call me snoop doggy dogg
I got a lot of bitches plus this nigga stay sharp
Now follow me, as I creep through the fog

Is secure for this shit you better keep It out of dodge

Before I put you in some shit
You really got to swap, then call the hustle boys
To get you mothafuckas robbed

Is five in the mornin'
I climb in my zone, I'm from the LBC
Where the climate is cold
And I know you player hatas got your eyes on my dope
Cause I spit that real shit
In your ear you can ??
Spend summers on the beach
Hidden gears on the boat
Fifty G's all in twennys keep the duffel bag closed

What you call heat
Eat a nigga'ho
Fo you chain snatchion niggas tryna size up my gold
Its the problem, I dont need no antidote
No cure nigga, I let the wound heal slow
I gotta keep it gangsta makin moves on the road
Tour bus full of weed smoke, bitches n' hoes
I've been doin this fo years
Nigga thats how it goes

Is the big boss dogg I'm the truth untold
West coast camping no mean to brag the boss
The benz or the porche, I done have them both
Lil snoop count my money cut my fingers its mo
Its the celebration, grab yo glass n' toast

West Coast!
