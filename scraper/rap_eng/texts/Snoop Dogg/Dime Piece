Yeah, big Snoop Dogg, LiLana, my nephew BigSha

[Hook: Lilana]
Dime piece, walk into your fantasy
(I'll be your fantasy)
So don’t blink
(don’t blink, blink)
You can miss your wildest dreams
(your wildest dreams)

[Verse 1: Lilana]
Relax, recline
It’s pleasure with the dime
Vacations and diamonds and messy sorta time
More than bump and grind
Don’t blink your eyes
And miss out all the good time

[Hook: Lilana]
Dime piece, walk into your fantasy
(I'll be your fantasy)
So don’t blink
(don’t blink, blink)
You can miss your wildest dreams
(your wildest dreams)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I step off the plane, spit my game
So sweet and sticky like candy cane
One night with the boss
Fuck what it costs, Ima show you how we do in the land of the lost

It’s doggy d-o, like Ne-Yo
So sick of L-O-V-E S-O-N-G
Roll more diesel, move through Europe like a pizzo
Fuck with my fizzle
You know I always take care of ya
Last seen in Bulgaria
All up in the club with LiLana
Trying to start the party
Big Sha get them gearos at more zeroes
Big Snoop Dogg get your hero
It’s plain to see, that the thing to be is your
Fantasy
So don’t blink

(Lilana) Heeeyy

[Hook: Lilana]
Dime piece, walk into your fantasy
(I'll be your fantasy)
So don’t blink
(don’t blink, blink)
You can miss your wildest dreams
(your wildest dreams)

[Sub Verse: Lilana]
Imagine how wild I can break it down
Break it down down down
Do ya do you know
I can be all your wildest dreams
Baby come here now
I’m bout to break it down

[Verse 3: Big Sha]
It’s ya boy we'll becoming the fleet
Do the King Kong bounce to the ounce
While I’m stomping the beat
In the Lambo boy I'm becoming the G
The best boy from Bulgarian chief
(I’m in the streets)
Our dimes are a million a piece
My money deep up on it
Respect the BG's most wanted
I drive the roof, Big Sha got the juice
A Bulgarian trappers crew
Ima sale high top gonna stop the move
I can slide Ima stop the proof
Shop the goods, get a fly girl knock the boots
So don't mind me when I talk to Snoop
(Talk to Snoop?)
If you wanna do the pin number
Pif in a la-la-life with LiLana
And toss doubles show enough muscles
To keep them on the front line hustle
