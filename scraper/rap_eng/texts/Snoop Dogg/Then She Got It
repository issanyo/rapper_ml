[Intro]
Hey, what's crack-a-lackin' world
This is Mr. Bad Ass
And we in the mix with D
*record scratch*
DJ Jam and Bigg Snoop Dogg on W-Ballz
'Cause everybody's gotta hear the shit
Bitch

[Verse 1 - Soopafly]
Sit back and serve
Soop about to swerve
You fucking with me?
Nigga you got your nerve
I'mma set the train
Down from step to brim
I got more game than him him and him
I stop simple talk from all simple men
Put them all together and disassemble them
Break down their chain, trout down their block
Stop, drop and cock and shot down their block
Burn their ass up and make it hot down their block
Fuck with Dogg House and get mopped down their block
It's like daddy's home to hear pop pop and pop
Kids grab your books, bitch ask to [?]
Stick around son, it gets worse than it looks
We up in the jungle, hear the beat of the congo
50 Niggas lookin like they [?]
It's just shakin' and bakin'
Soop will make them and break them
Split the whole scene man it's more money for takin'
It's a freak ho, I guess this bitch is kinda Jamaican

[Hook]
Cause she's smoking out
And she did that dare
And she broke it down
And she hit the ground
So I put that thang on her
I had my game on her
I adjust the mouth
Then she pulled it out
She talking about "Give it to me"
Ok, "Give it to me"
Alright, "Give it to me"
Fo' Sho', "Give it to me"
Come on, "Give it to me"
Alright, "Give it to me"
Uh huh, "Give it to me"
Then she got it

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
Homie got [?], yeah mix [?], keep her game [?], she hangs with mouse trizaps
Suckas try to do this, but Dogg done did that
Smooth in a mother fucker, cool like cojack
My bitches take a nizzap, keeps them on the trizzap
With my nails long so I can bomb on my [?]
Yeah I got lizzacks, and pimp on the mizzacks
And keep the strizzaps and go "Rat-a-tat-tizzat"
Do you like tizzat? Ain't the same rizzat
Give me the dice, I'm nice, no up on the Crizzap
Slice of you did that, some dice for your [?]
This shit was so hot your grandmomma said "She wanna here that"
"Na big momma, you know I ain't with that"
But you know I ain't gonna get that, might as well just kick back
So what you wanna do, that?
Now after I taught her no body she did it and did it now

[Hook]
