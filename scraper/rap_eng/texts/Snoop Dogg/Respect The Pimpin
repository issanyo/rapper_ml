Ooh, respect the pimpin'
Ooh, respect the pimpin'

I'll never forget the Ward Brothers player
Old school pimps like Roosevelt Taylor
The list goes on for like three generations
Oakland pimp shit, all in your face man

Some other cities take pride in trickin'
You can hear it when their rappers start spittin'
Instead of you and yo' woman gettin' money together
You do all the hustlin' and she gets all the cheddar

You tell her go shop but she ain't got a job
Then you brag in your raps, to me it sounds odd
'Cause I was raised by pimps in the O
They taught me real good how to send a hoe

And now you niggas tryin' to bend the rules
You must have came up around some friendly dudes
You need to stop doin' all that extra simpin'
And change the words in your song and respect the pimpin'

You've got money but you got no game
Think all the ladies wanna love you?
Probably gotta make it rain
Take her shoppin', respect the pimpin'

You a front for the game, you was posin'
Got your gators and your super Q
Can you feel me?
Respect the pimpin'

All I wanna be is well known now
Drive a 'Lac, big mack and do my own style
Keep a freak on the street that fit the profile
At the pad, money stack, watchin' dough pile

Reminiscin' of a player that I once knew
He had it all, went broke but he still kept it true
Bounced back like a real mack, got a new sack
New hoes, new clothes and found a new track

Now that's a player that I always wanna be like
Did dirt, went to church and lived the street life
Ask Short, ask Snoop, we gon' tell you the truth
A real pimp keep a prostitute and she get lots of loot

Do what she got's to do
Come back with moolah like she 'posed to do
And stay close to you, so if you ever fell
Here's the one most important thing about this tale

Ask Michelle, Tammy and Nell when they went to jail
They know who came through with that bail, it was me
'Cause I respect the P, do the same
Don't be no lame, respect the game

Ooh, respect the pimpin'
Ooh, respect the pimpin'
Ooh, respect the pimpin'
