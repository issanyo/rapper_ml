Hungry kids in the crib, ma
Pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot
Pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot
When the craving's got a hold of you
Pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot
Pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot
And your munchies get a attitude
Pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot
Pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot
I got the pockets in my arms settin' off smoke alarms
And I eat them smokin' hot cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 1: DeStorm]
Yo, I'm a hot dude, with some hot dreams
Gettin' fired up, lettin' off steam
Everybody's showin' love, Herby's in the tub
Checkin' applications for the Hot Pocket fan club
Pepperoni pizza much better than some fish eggs
Interior too hot, let's cool it off for a few secs
I'm runnin' for the taste, that could be my phys ed
Jumpin' hot pockets, that's how you get ahizzead
Yo, ? get the meaty-meats, winners get the cheesy eats
The tag-team meal that's too hot for TV
Get off my pockets, you gotta back up
Yeah that's wassup, now sign the pre-nups
Me and Hot Pockets is never gon' split up (Never gon' split up)
You should think about it, take a second

[Break: Andy Milonakis]
Hot Pockets, Herbsauce (Cheesy drizzle)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I bring the heat, but y'all knew that
The big sauce boss, yeah I had to do that
I keep it fired up, even when I'm inside
You take what's mine, then you're gonna have to run and hide

[Verse 3: Andy Milonakis]
He light 'em up so much that everybody talks
They all wanna turn in his Hot Pockets box
Two to the one-one, yup three
This Hot Pockets are so H-O double T
Smoky tabs hittin' that three thirty-three
(You can't stand this hot then you can't chill with me)
So bring your friends, we goin' on a wild ride
Herbsauce, tender meats heat up your inside

[Break: Snoop Dogg]
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a lizzle
Got some cheesy drizzle, drippin' on my shizzle
Waitin' on the brizzle, the prizzle, the gizzle g's
When the cheese hits your tongue you'll scream, "Fo shizzle"
