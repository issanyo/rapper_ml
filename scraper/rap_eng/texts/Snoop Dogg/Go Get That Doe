[Hook: Ca$h Out]
Go get that dough
My bitch won't go
Go get that dough
My bitch won't go
My bitch won't go
She get the money
My bitch won't go
She get that money
My bitch won't go
She get that money
Go get that dough
Twenty, fifties, hundreds

[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]
I ain't got no type, you know what I like
She independent, girl I'm independent
And you know I'm winnin'
Go get that dough, stay stuntin'
She keep a look as her own, she spray something
And when we go to the mall I don't pay nothing
She spending cash
I like the new one on me, she like, but I'm nothing
I'm smoking naughty weed, she like now what you puffin'?
And if it's bout money, she loving that discussion
Go get that dough, my girl gettin' money
Is your girl gettin' money?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cas$h Out]
Ew, we're really busted and disgusted
Boss bitch spendin' money like it's nothing
Red bottoms to service, and she knows shoes
And we go to the same jeweler to get the jewels
Five K for a hand bag, turn her up
Boss bitch you deserve that, shown off
I put her up on gang, she ain't worry bout you
Bank account on swell, she ain't heard about you
I don't want a relationship, keep getting money
What's gonna make me lay them off, hundreds

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Go get it, cause I need it
And got to have it
And I need a fow wow on an average
Beast, my bitch is a savage
Carrots and cabbage, lettuce, silly rabbit
Fast lane with the cash game
First name dollar and bill is my last name
Get my groove on, powder blue alligator shoes on
Cruise on choose on, not knowing the chief
Showing the p, keep going, you going to be
Owning a jeep, a little more than some dollar
Alakazam scram!

[Hook]

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Cash out, Snoop Dogg
Break bread or fake dead
Yeah!
