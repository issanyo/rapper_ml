[Hook: Kool John]
Ahh shit gah damn!
Gah damn, gah damn, gah damn
She tell me, she tell me that I'm the man
She tell me, she tell me that I'm the man
(x2)

[Verse 1: Kool John]
She tellin' me that she love me
She givin' me all the cutty
My whipped cream and soda muddy
My pockets is gettin' chubby
Who jealous I wanna fuck with
I'm actin' all loud in public
My verses is out your budget, bitch
I bet your girlfriend notice me
I got a Fanta and it's dirtier than low be
I bet your ex-man, he don't make more than me
[?] like an R&B
She see me gettin' money, and she love me for it
Good dick in my pants, and she bug me for it
I get around, I ain't talkin' tourin'
I got thousand dollar shoes and I never wore 'em
Remember when I used to reach out?
Now a nigga money longer than a beach towel
You can catch a nigga out when the freaks out, weed loud
Kill her, get the money, then it's peace out

[Hook: Kool John]
Ahh shit gah damn!
Gah damn, gah damn, gah damn
She tell me, she tell me that I'm the man
She tell me, she tell me that I'm the man

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Me and my comrade
In a room for a hoes and they all bad
I can have anyone when I want
But I can't and I ain't, so I don't
You know I get it how I live homie
I keep that motherfuckin' thang for the pigs homie
I shoot them like I shoot you
Kick like it's kung-fu
Mic check one-two, ahh
Lean on a nigga like I'm in the post
Screen on a nigga from the left coast
Big dog, livin' in the matrix
Big dog, we gon' take it back to the basics

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
I just woke up in a suite with a bad one
Everyday I'm peelin' new shit out the plastic
Called the plug from my watch, got my wrist work
One hand up her skirt, make her kiss her
10k for the verse, do [?] for free
She know I'm easier to find and harder to keep
That's my new flow, my old one old
I'm a young rich nigga from the 5-1-0
Gah damn, I'm on one again
Hopped off a plane, now I'm on one again
Rolled up a plane and she rolled one again
I'm about to crack open them Trojans again
