[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Shit, nigga straight trippin' man
Boy Trizzoy ran out of bud
I tell Joe goin' back to the islands
Nigga need a hit man
I ain't had a hit in about a week
I be trying to put this album together without no weed
I don't think I can pull this shit off
Need to get me a hit man

[Hook: Jewell]
Do you
Smoke enough, smoke enough, smoke enough, smoke enough bud
I wanna know
Baby do you
Smoke enough, smoke enough, smoke enough, smoke enough bud
I gotta know

[Verse 1: Jewell]
If the answer's no, you better come see me
Cause I'm always smoking chronic
And I got what you need when you need it
Don't get high and leave it
Baby anytime you want some bud
You can come and get it from me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jewell]
Well, if you don't something's wrong with you
Now you can't come see me
Cause I'm always stocked on chronic
And blazing so much weed
When you need it, Snoop how you need it ?
Baby anytime you want some bud
You can come and get it from me

[Alternate Hook]

[Verse 3: Jewell]
Snoop do you
Do you
Smoke enough
I gotta know

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg]
I mean damn
I mean when most people think about smoking bud
It's just a passtime hobby
But I mean for me its like
Wake up in the morning
I gotta have it
I gots to groove with it, you know
Its just a whole thing where I'm missing it right now
I miss this thing like I used to miss my girl
And I mean one question was asked to me
I'm gonna have to ask you the question
Do you smoke enough bud
Do you get enough bud
Cause if you don't you need to
And thats real

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Jewell]
Do you
Smoke enough bud babe
Do you
Smoke enough bud babe
Do you
Smoke enough bud babe
Do you
Smoke enough bud babe
Do you
Smoke enough bud babe
Do you
Smoke enough bud babe

Smoke enough bud babe
Do you
I wanna know do you
Can you tell do you
Smoke enough bud
Snoop won't you tell me
Are you high yet
Did you get enough bud
Baby, baby
Cause you can come and get it
Anytime you want it
Know that I will have it
Cause I got your bud
Do you babe
Get enough bud
