[2pac]
Got me up against the fence, back against the wall
Get to actin like a fool, cause ain't no justice for the dog
Got to take it out on all y'all, better read the papers
All my homies goin crazy baby only God could save us
Got my, min on currency hurry see I ain't worried
It's a gangsta party, so bad boy gettin buried
Snoop dogg, why they fantasize? (fantasize)
When we ride, it's a must havin sets die, everytime

[snoop dogg]
*singing*
Yes yes y'all, not $hort but snoop dogg
And you know it's like that y'all
*rapping*
I'm so smooth about my paper check it just how it's done
I'm servin any on a platter snoop dogg corleone
Corleone, now do you know what that mean?
A teflon don to this hip-hop game, super supreme
It's like what happen can happen but will it stop
That won't happen I'm feelin good about the mission for jackin
*singing*
Aiyyo patnah, can you feel me?
Why these fools, tryin ta kill me?
*rapping*
It's so hard to stay focused on my eyes and prize
But if I don't, the dogg won't survive

[2pac]
We ballin in my opinion eternal was wild wheel spinnin
One sip a minute is represented for five minutes
Two of the livest wanted dead or alive
We riders inventers because we ain't quiet and watch the g's ride
Two of amerikkkaz most, straight out the west coast
Bow down fool, this is death row
Been waitin way too long, bust out the pen, now it's on
C'mon, snoop dogg, time to bone

[snoop dogg]
Ain't nuttin changed too down to hang I slang a bang with a rhyme
Me and the homey pac trippin death row on knobs
Gon survive by eastside of dpg'z
Still creepin bump through the hood, always involved in the streets
(westside!) snoop doggy dogg homey, did you forget who I was
The big homey to you, there it is and there it was...
Now take a look through the eyes of g
And just ride to the rhythm of a gangsta beat

[2pac]
All my homies tellin, me, ain't no love for a real g

You straight cowards all you playa haters kill me
Throw up your hands if you feel me
We gettin dollars homey holla if you hear me
It's one time for my comrades doin bad lockdown
Fresh out bust the top and bounce drop down
Can you visualize perfection?
Cause every rider in my set labelled a vet best in their profession
Don't hold your breath, stick to smith and wessun
Steady study your lessons to keep the crowd guessin

[snoop]
Straight gangsta, y'know?
Money to be made, situations get deeper
Niggas always tryin ta creep
But I know what time it is

Gangstas, yeah yeah yeah
