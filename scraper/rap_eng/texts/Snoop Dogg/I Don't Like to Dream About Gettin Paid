[Verse 1: Dat Nigga Daz]
Working LA
Tryin to get paid tha right way
But somehow the right way don't pay
I'm comin home late every night
Gotta struggle and fight
Wit tha baseheads on tha late night hype
Tryin to creep in tha house
Through tha cut, for what?
So I won't be seen by none of the homies, but
Tha homie Nate Dogg spots me and say "Yo, what's happenin'?
Oh, you don't know me no more", and passed me tha satin
I said "Ah naw, it ain't like that, G
I'm trying to go straight and have a J-O-B"
"You need to quit that faggot ass job", that's what he said
Showed me his grip and took some satin to tha head
Damn that nigga had at least two G's
And he was clockin it wit so much ease
I told him I was gone so I'm headin in tha house
Everybody knocked out, so I'm locked out
I go back to tha front where my homies is hangin at
They offer me a cavi sack so I can start slangin dat
They say "You ain't a hustler," I say "Don't doubt it
Hold dat thought and I'll think about it because..."

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
[I've been dreamin too long, too long, too long]
I don't like to dream about gettin paid

[Verse 2: Dat Nigga Daz]
The thought's complete so let me take a seat
Since I was born and raised on tha streets
I quit tha job I had and cop myself a sack
Went from a double of fifty into a C-note stack
Within a week but my peak wasn't reached
I was gettin too known on tha north side of Long Beach
Niggas got to trippin and I thought I heard it
So I went to tha hood on 20th and Myrtle
I came up quick with some homies dat I knew from way way back
And bid my sack
Or maybe it's seven, or was it eight hundred strong?
In other words Daz had it goin on
I bought myself a bucket, that's right, a bucket, bitch
Who you fuckin my car or my dick
My lifestyle switched a bit but my attitude didn't
I told all my old bitches good riddance
'Cause when you got money hoes come automatically
And old hoes don't do nothing but cause some static, see
I went from khakis to Guess, braids to a fade
I'm not Special Ed but I had it made
Livin tha life of a baller care free
Havin bitches dyin to sleep wit me ya see
But I went bankrupt from all the spending and gamblin
Business was gettin slow, and I wasn't handlin
Mine tha way I was supposed to
Now I'm broke and on a jack mission, so don't get close to
Tha DPG gang 'cause we scandalous when we broke
We get tha doggs in us and we get ta actin like locs

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
Last night I had a dream
Felt so good it had to be
Me and my homies were gettin paid
Man oh man we had it made
Some homies want to roll wit me
Some homies claim insanity
Well if you want to set trip I will
If you don't want to drop be still

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Damn, I can't believe this
But you can best believe this day
I'm on another mission to get paid
Serve what I can serve right [right]
So my pockets will stack up
Nigga, don't trip, nigga, back up [hold up]
I gots to react off the first impulse I find
But my mama thinks I should take my time
And work for mines
But how much work would it take
And how much money would I make
Wait
Theres somethin I gotta think about
But I ain't got that much time
Moms want a nigga out tha house
I ain't gettin no younger, I'm only gettin older
I'm only, thinking about what my mama told me
Now I'm a Dogg Pound gangsta for life
And the fact that I'm out to get paid twice
I ain't nuttin nice
Down to slang or pull a heist
Jack or break muthafuckas on the dice
That's real
Now what should I do
Just chill when it's time to peel caps and adapt to kill
I've concealed tha concealed
So I've maintained for tha salary
And my mentally is raw from tha door
I go hard from tha door
Up against all odds
Always down to squab
Dogg Pound for life
I survive til 95 day after day
Makin hits wit D-A-Z ta get paid, nigga, yeah

[Chorus]
