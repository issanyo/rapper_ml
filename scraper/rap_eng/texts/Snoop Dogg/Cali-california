So G, it's me, LBC
The turf by the surf and you can sail with me
Palm trees, policies, a lotta weed
We got just what you want, oh batabing
So if you out here by my way
In sunny Cali-Forn-I-A
Oh yeah, this is DPG
Now you can catch a little heat from my girl Sweet P

Hear them say that
I be single
I'll be single
By the summer time
I done fell in love
You're the only one
You're the only one my mind
The way you do it like that
Make me wanna come right back
The way I do it like that
DJ betta run this back

Oh baby
Somethin' bout your love it drives me crazy
Like a summer in California
Oh baby
Somethin' bout your love it drives me crazy
Like a summer in California

You got what I need
Your love take me to ecstasy
Rollin' with me
We can do anything on your mind
The way you do it like that make
Make me wanna come right back
The way I do it like that
DJ betta run this back

Oh baby
Somethin' bout your love it drives me crazy
Like a summer in California
Oh baby
Somethin' bout your love it drives me crazy
Like a summer in California

I'm West Coast, rich city, up top chillin'
Put a plate together
Straight plottin' on a million
Drivin' these women crazy like summer in LA
Then bounce up to the Bay
Where they love HB to the K
I was like three watchin' Snoop up on the screen
Like
I'mma do this, uck workin' for the team
Now I'm long hair, don't care
Everywhere, on the grind
All the time poppin' like Cali in the summer

Oh baby
Somethin' bout your love it drives me crazy
Like a summer in California
Oh baby
Somethin' bout your love it drives me crazy
Like a summer in California
