Artistic as it gets is big Snoop Dogg
So throw a pawn in the lawn
And, let me show you how it's supposed to be
Blow up like a bomb, napalm
Let me show you what it's supposed to be
Now get close to me, these are groceries
File them in the cabinet, stab it, let it go
This is my art form, I'm so original
Like Ice-T, but I don't drip, drop on the floor
Get a ho, get the door
Let 'em know from the door
Here we go, let it ride
Snoopy D-O-double-G, Eastside LBC
Show you how it's supposed to be
Look up at the sky
Do you see the moon and the sun?
It's Snoop D-O-doub
Yes, I am the only one
When it comes to freestyle, boy, I'm so cold
Make a nigga flip to it to a whole 'nother episode
Watch a ho, hit the stroll
Get the money, bring it back
Ice-T got hi wife, sitting in the cadillac
Coco, there you go
Steal the money, steal the show
Snoop D-O-double-G, I told you I'm original
