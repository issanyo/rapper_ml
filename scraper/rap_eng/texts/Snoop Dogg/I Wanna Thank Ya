Ladies & Gentlemen
This is a Jazze fizzle product-shizzle (Let's do it)
Angie Stone, sing it baby (Ooh, let's do it)
Fo'shizzle, dizzle, and you can't forget about
The big snoopy deegle double gizzle, yeah
(Let's do it, right)

[Verse 1: Angie]
Oh, love, I just don't know what it is you do to me
So many ups there's no room to complain
Got me feeling free
And I ain't diggin' nobody but you
Can't take a chance on nobody new
And I'm feelin' everything you do
Your love is gangsta, I wanna thank ya

[Chorus: Angie]
Love it when you love me, baby
Love it when you love me, darlin'
Oh, 'cause you know I love you, baby
You know I really love you, darlin'
Love it when you love me, baby
Love it when you love me, darlin'
Oh, 'cause you know I love you, baby
You know I really love you, darlin'

[Verse 2: Angie]
Ah. you know you're my destiny
And I love this chemistry
It keeps on pulling me
Making me see you're the one God fashioned for me
I can't explain how you're makin' me feel
Throw up my hands 'cause this feeling is real
Wiggle 'em around 'cause you're puttin' it down
Your love is gangsta, I wanna thank ya

[Chorus: Angie]
Love it when you love me, baby
Love it when you love me, darlin'
Oh, 'cause you know I love you, baby
You know I really love you, darlin'
Love it when you love me, baby
Love it when you love me, darlin'
Oh, 'cause you know I love you, baby
You know I really love you, darlin'

[Verse 3: Angie]
You give me a natural high
Love me so good, I'm on cloud nine
(You're love) to be the seventh heaven
I consider it a blessing
Many tried but could not get it right
Now I found out that I have up and died

[Chorus: Angie]
Love it when you love me, baby
Love it when you love me, darlin'
Oh, 'cause you know I love you, baby
You know I really love you, darlin'
Love it when you love me, baby
Love it when you love me, darlin'
Oh, 'cause you know I love you, baby
You know I really love you, darlin'

[Middle: Snoop Dogg]
G-A-N-G-S-T-A
From what I see ? Boo, it's a must we stay
We stay together, forever
You see cuz ever is ever
And never ever would nobody do it better than the "S"
Oh yes, I guess you're blessed
I put the rocks on ya fingers, earrings jingle
No more single, you got a man in ya life
And I understand watcha like
Ya friends don't understand why you be seeing me
But they don't understand that you love the 'G' in me
The way I walk, the way I look, the way I talk
The way we make love in the dark
Some things in life were meant to be
I thank God above that you were sent for me
You see cuz my point of view, it's all about you
You got to tell me what you wanna do

[Post-Bridge: Angie & (Snoop Dogg)]
Come into my life
Boy, I adore you (I need you, I need you)
Come into my life (Yeah, yeah)
Boy, I adore you (Let's do it, let's do it)
Come into my life (I'm down with it)
Boy, I adore you (Yeah, c'mon, c'mon)
Come into my life (Yeah)
Boy, I adore you
(I gotta do it, do it, I gotta to do it, do it)

[Chorus: Angie]
Love it when you love me, baby
Love it when you love me, darlin'
Oh, 'cause you know I love you, baby
You know I really love you, darlin'
Love it when you love me, baby
Love it when you love me, darlin'
Oh, 'cause you know I love you, baby
You know I really love you, darlin'
