[Chorus: J-Black]
This is that very special time of year
Throughout the hood they're spreading Christmas cheer
Good food and family, everybody is dancing
And you know I'm so glad that it's here, it's here
It's Christmas

[Verse 1: J-Black]
Everything is so right, the trees and the Christmas lights are so bright
Sort of fairy tale Snow White
It's such, yes, an wonderful and beautiful Christmas
Can you hear the caroling, jingle bells ring? Mistletoe kissing
This feeling, I never ever want to leave
I do believe ain't nothing like Christmas, yeah
And if it seems a little too cold then maybe we can go to the fireplace
And let the fire blaze all night long
And it will keep you warm on this holyday
Oh, I love it, yeah, I love it, though, you love it, yeah
'Cause this is

[Chorus: J-Black]
This is that very special time of year
Throughout the hood they're spreading Christmas cheer
Good food and family, everybody is dancing
And you know I'm so glad that it's here, it's here
It's Christmas

[Verse 2: J-Black]
And Santa's on his way here
With help from his elves and his reindeers
He has gifts and candy canes, yeah, tell me
Somebody tell me what you know about Christmas
With all the food that you can eat, look out the sweets
Oh, there's eggnog in my drink
I'm shimmering and lighting up my favorite tree that can be
Anything like Christmas, yeah
And if it seems a little too cold then maybe we can go to the fireplace
And let the fire blaze all night long
And it will keep you warm on this holyday
Oh, I love it, yeah, I love it, though, you love it, yeah
'Cause this is

[Chorus: J-Black]
This is that very special time of year
Throughout the hood they're spreading Christmas cheer
Good food and family, everybody is dancing
And you know I'm so glad that it's here, it's here
It's Christmas

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Shante want a new house and Slink want a car
Lil' Snoop want a G and Jack wanna be a star
Can I grant these wishes? I guess I can
'Cause once again it's merry Christmas
And it's nothing like getting your folks what they been wanting for months
See, most of us been blessed stay blessed 'cause we keep on blessing
Be jolly and keep on pressing, somebody gonna learn a lesson
About love, more hugs, no shrug, show love
Face to face as we sit by the fireplace, the food is great, have a taste
Now turn up the bass and let me throw a pass to my whole room class
First and foremost we walk in slow-mo, Santa got me a brand new lolo
Feeling the breeze blowing the Christmas tree

[Chorus: J-Black]
This is that very special time of year
Throughout the hood they're spreading Christmas cheer
Good food and family, everybody is dancing
And you know I'm so glad that it's here, it's here
It's Christmas
