[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothing without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's something about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute with it, fuck a little
What's the use?
Never superficial, you gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay we're colder than the breeze
But the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker hol' up
You don't need to hol' up, yeah
And I can show you how I seem
What it is, what it truly might be, nothing that you know of
You don't need to hol' up
I'm so a-bove and beyond you take drugs to make it up
Way up where we on, space shuttle, Elon
Time, we don't waste much, fuck when we wake up
Then have her sing just like CÃ©line Dion
Catch me if you can but, you'll never catch me, damn
Whole lotta "yes I am"
All the way in with no exit plan
Already left and the jet don't land
Yeah, the time is ticking, come take a ride, get inside
This is highly different, I'm talking fly, got a pilot wit' 'im
Can I mind my business?
Why you trippin'? Give you somethin' that your eyes can witness
Ou, you're too close
I don't understand why you doing the most

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Snoop Dogg]
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothing without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's something about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute with it, fuck a little, what's the use? What's the use?
Never superficial, you gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Well I'ma give you what you came for, yeah
Shit, I've worked too hard to have a clue who you are
Set the bar so far above par, we can parlay all day
Crib long range with the yard
I know I should probably pray more but you gotta love me
'Cuz I save the day spendin' money
When I had nothing shit it wasn't so funny
Made a promise to the homies nobody go hungry
Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name
But it never worried my brain
Heads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'
Tell the sun get up outta my shade
If they don't get the picture, cut 'em out of that frame, shit
I'm up 30 thou miles plus change
It's been a while but I'm down 'till I'm out and it is what it is 'til it ain't

[Bridge: Thundercat]
Ooh oooh
Ooh, I just wanna fly

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Snoop Dogg]
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothing without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's something about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute with it, fuck a little, what's the use?
What's the use?
Never superficial, you gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
You can love it
It just freaks me out
