[Intro]
It's no mad times and there's no sad times
Only good vibes and high sides when you're smoking tide
Shoopi-doop
Now come get high with big (?)
Get high

[Hook: Nef The Pharaoh]
They tell me to quit that shit, can't put it down, I tried
Now watch me catch an attitude, I trip when I'm not high
I got to smoke, I got to smoke
Rollin' up the smoke, rollin' up the smoke

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
Man the story all starts at the age of 12
I saw my uncle roll weed and I liked the smell
He'll let me take a hit and I'll be high as hell
Fuck around hit a lick now I got bud for sale
As a king had a dream I had a digital beam
Late night trap house high as the skies you see
I just recently invested in a book called green
And hooked a nigga to some knowledge on a thing called weed
I was down in Vancouver smokin' Grape Ape in my loft
Change the smoke alarm, make sure that bitch ain't goin' off
That grand daddy purp yeah, you ain't never heard of no soft
I got some cheddar now, thinkin' bout knockin' you over
The (?) slaps (?) in the sprinter
Movin' like a ninja turtle smokin' Master Splinter
It's (?) in my cup I ain't gon' save her I'm a sinner
Step your edibles up, I eat marijuana for dinner

[Hook: Nef The Pharaoh]
They tell me to quit that shit, can't put it down, I tried
Now watch me catch an attitude, I trip when I'm not high
I got to smoke, I got to smoke
Rollin' up the smoke, rollin' up the smoke

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Man I was 12 years old livin' on the east side
When I really got high you know from my first time
And I didn't like it so I quit for a bit
Now three years later I'm chillin' with a bitch
She say hit this so I hit it and I quit it
And I passed it and then she started actin' real nasty
This shit was new to me
Now she tellin' me what she about to do to me
Willingly, fluently
I'm young so I did it, yessir
I got sprung when I hit it, I'll admit it
So from that day forward I made it a must
To push kush and blow blunts to fuck now
I blow up out of bow-wow
King Chronic aka big Bow-Wow
From the Bay to the A then back to LA
Will I quit? Think not, no way

[Hook: Nef The Pharaoh]
They tell me to quit that shit, can't put it down, I tried
Now watch me catch an attitude, I trip when I'm not high
I got to smoke, I got to smoke
Rollin' up the smoke, rollin' up the smoke
They tell me to quit that shit, can't put it down, I tried
Now watch me catch an attitude, I trip when I'm not high
I got to smoke, I got to smoke
Rollin' up the smoke, rollin' up the smoke
