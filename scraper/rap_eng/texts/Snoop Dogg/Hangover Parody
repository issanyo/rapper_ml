[Hook 1: PSY & Snoop Dogg]
Hungover, hungover, hungover
Woke up an organ donor
Bent over, bent over
Throwing up next to a big black stoner
Can't stop puking
Where'd I get this ring?
Hey I have one too we must have married this morning
Who's that kid? Who's that kid? Who's that kid?
Oh shit he is adopted
I'm tatted
I'm tatted
Goddammit I wonder what else we did
Can't remember shit
Need to check our pics
We totally blacked out
What the hell dude did we kiss?

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Smells like a skunk, just farted out bud
Psy weighs a ton, I'm a rapping skeleton
It's alright, I look like the black Slender Man
"Gentleman" was better than this song
Still think I'm Rasta Mon
Yea my braids so old they got cobwebs
Last night was not fun
Afraid we touhed willys
Really for sure that
In this video Psy spends more time eating noodles than he does singing
Diabetes

[Verse 2: PSY]
This song is a miss
I just took a piss
That's why the water look like this
Eenie meenie miney mae
This beat copied "Harlem Shake"
It is in my contract to always be in a jaccuzi

[Unknown Voice]
Hey!

[Pre-Hook 1: PSY & Snoop Dogg]
Drinking again to forget that we made a porn
We were drunk so messed up
Found a bird inside my butt
I love you Snoop Dogg
Love you too William Hung
Come on man
Why? Wassup?
Wrong Asian man!
I fucked up
(받으시오)
It's time to smoke
When Psy winks it looks like he's having a stroke
(받으시오)
This song is shit
All of the lyrics are completely worthless
Might as well just be saying random shit like...

[Hook 2: PSY, Snoop Dogg & Dead Grover]
Lawn mower, lawn mower, lawn mower, lawn mower, lawn mower
October, October, October, October, tober, tober
October
Dead grover, dead grover, dead grover, dead grover, grover, grover
Somebody cut me down when this awful song's over!

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Waking and baking, smoked way to much
All of the weeds changing my brain into mush
Can someone tell me how I ended up in Korea?
Tipping and dripping, my grandpa flow
Just changed my name again an hour ago
Time to brainstorm more animals
So i can change my name so mo
Snoop Panda, Snoop Donkey, Snoop Domesticated Fox
Snoop the Canary, Snoop Rhinoceros
S-N-O-O-P- insert
Lion or leopard
Might as well be an Apple computer

[Low Voice]
A milli, a milli, a milli

[Lil Wayne]
This sounds just like "A Milli"
Copied me, copied me
You assholes straight jacked my beat

[Unkown Voice]
Hey!

[Pre-hook 2 (Attempt 1): PSY, Rodman & Kim Jong]
Me and Snoop are lifelong
Like Rodman and Kim Jong
Hold it up! You guys suck!
Nowhere near the two of us
You don't stand a chance
We're the better bromance
What the fuck? Shut it up!
Shit what's that? I blow them up!

[Skit: Bart Baker, PSY]
Goddammit! Who the hell is calling me right now?
Hey, Bart Baker, what's going on right now?
Oh, hey PSY! Not much, just chilling
Well, listen. My new video, Hangover, has just come out and I wanted to ask, please, do not make parody of it. This song means a lot to me and I don't want anyone to make fun of it
Oh, yeah, sure. You got it, no parody
Thank you, dude. You're a very good friend. Wait, wait, wait, what's up with your face? Why is it just like that?
No, It doesn't. Gotta go!
No no no, no. You don't make parody of--
Sorry, guys, where were we?

[Pre-hook 2 (Attempt 2): Rodman & Kim Jong]
Shit what's that? I blow them up!
