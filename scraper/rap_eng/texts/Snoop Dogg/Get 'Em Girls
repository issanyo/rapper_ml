I don't need a runway
I got all my Get em' Girls
I got all my Get em' Girls
I can cat, walk my way to the front page
I got all my Get em' girls
I got all my Get em' girls
I got all my Get em' girls
(Watcha get em girl, I'mma swing my hips this way)

I got all my get em' Girls, you can call em' prada heels
I don't need a runway to walk it out the spine of it
And I got a hundred bags, different colors come see
Gucci, alligators, call em' crocodile Dundee
Now take it to the floor
I'm sayin' hello
You ain't tips, got em' flying like a sparrow
Get em' outta twos, like they know I were stilettos

Fresh Jimmy Choos, got em' pointing like a narrow

Chorus:
I don't need a runway
I got all my Get em' Girls
I got all my Get em' Girls
I can cat, walk my way to the front page
I got all my Get em' Girls
I got all my Get em' Girls
I got all my Get em' Girls
(Watcha get em' girl, I'mma swing my hips this way)
Bridge
Get em' Girl
And back and rock, and back, back rock
And back and rock, and back, back rock
And back and rock, and back, back rock
And back and rock
Now go and strike a pose

Let me see you in the pearly mama
Dress goin' like your Marilyn Munroe (uh uh, uh uh)
(Now go and strike a pose)
There rang with the fur around it
No stopping me with the fur around me
Click, click the alarm in the Maserati
Click, click from my hears is the matters money
Click, click goes the camera's from the paparazzi
I'm the shit, you can ask the whole world about me

I don't need a runway
I got all my Get em' Girls
I got all my Get em' Girls

I can cat, walk my way to the front page
I got all my Get em' Girls
I got all my Get em' Girls
I got all my Get em' g-g get em' girls
I got all my Get em' g-g get em' girls
I got all my Get em' Girls
I got all my Get em' Girls
I got all my Get em' Girls

Get em' Girl
And back and rock, and back, back rock
And back and rock, and back, back rock
And back and rock, and back, back rock
And back and rock

High heels are every woman's fame
I don't know what I'd to without em'
Right now I feel so on display
The camera's flash
And everyone's asking where you get em' girl

Snoop Dogg:

You can tell ‘em that you got ‘em from the boss dog
I got to hook up, look up and let the rain fall
Impressin’ ya, dressin’ ya, neva stressin’ ya
Instant message ya “go get ‘em, Jessica”
Is it possible, pop a bottle, we’ll slide away?
We’re on all fours, with no clothes and hide away
Then I walk ya down the runway of success
Playin’ in your head: just shoes and sex
It’s erotic
Shooty that shawty
Grab a harmony, oh baby, you got it
Tell you the truth
I dip the whip
Then flip the script
We’ll go hip to hip
Don’t rock the boat, just play you’re role
Watch your legs, now polish your toes
Flip your hair, now you’re right
You’re wonderful, marvelous, out of sight

Snoop Dogg:
