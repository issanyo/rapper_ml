I got 25 ways I can get it (get it)
And 20 homeboys that's fully with it (with it)
It's only gon' take 'bout 30 minutes (minutes)
From the effects that you feel from the bag of spinach (ah)
It's vintage, authentic, I have no limits
C Walk in the party, let the Crips up in it (let the Crips up in it)
To handle our business, baby, put your back up in it (back up in it)
C.B., O.T., yeah, we back up in it (O.T., ooh wee)
The west coast do the most, take a drag of the dope (take a drag of the dope)
House party like a motherfucker, full of my folks (full of my folks)
He and dog, O.E. and a couple of P's (couple of P's)
Pile of seeds, weed, and a couple of G's (couple of G's)
Ooh wee, I got the mic, it's my turn (drop, dr-drop, my turn)
The roof is on fire, let that motherfucker burn (let that motherfucker burn)
We don't need no water if your daughter is hot (if your daughter is hot)
Just send her to the Dogg so I can woop-de-wop (woop-de-wop)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Sexy girl, you came to party
You and your girlfriends
3's company (yeah)
Girl, I don't mind, fun times, oh, baby
Let me see you walk, step to me (oh)
This way when you shake that booty (oh yeah)
Hit your walk, hop to it (walk, to it)
I'ma show you how a real player do it

[Verse 2: O.T. Genasis]
Skip, skip, skip, skip, skip
I'm a long beach nigga, long beach Crip (Crip)
C Walk the party, big thang on her hip (hip, yeah)
Gun never tiny, you can kiss this tip (muah!)
Handle, got that stick like magic (yeah)
Hit it, let her fall for the silver sand
But I don't drink it straight, where the Kool-Aid? (Kool-Aid)
Leave a nigga bloody like bootleg (bootleg, brap)
I'm a northside nigga, stand on my toes (nigga, go)
Sisqó nigga, staying on the hoes (nigga, hoes)
I heard she a flip, ran off her clothes (yeah, woah)
Threw her in the air, landed on the bros (wee, oh)
O.T., S.D., C.B
Get any nigga say some', gotta see me (ha)
36 O's, pair of phones
Double M give it up, chunky

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Sexy girl, you came to party (yeah)
You and your girlfriends (huh)
3's company (3, baby)
Girl, I don't mind, fun times, oh, baby (you better let me see you)
Let me see you walk, step to me (step to me, ooh)
This way when you shake that booty (oh yeah)
Hit your walk, hop to it (walk, to it)
I'ma show you how a real player do it

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I ain't tryna knock your hustle, babe (yeah)
You know I'm a dog, but there's no petting
More fire, more loud, we all gettin' blazed (yeah)
You lookin' like twins, both hands, two bodies
One I'm in the sheets, other one her knees (sheets)
Mary Jane's a freak, and I love Molly (Molly)
I'm tryna paint two Mona Lisas
One black, one white, at the same time
Them strobe lights keep flashing
It's just me and you two in this room (ooh)
And it feels like déjà vu (déjà vu)
Like I been here with you two, before

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Play on player, play on, play on, play on player

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Sexy girl, you came to party
