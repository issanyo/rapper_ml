[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Tell me where the weed at
I got bad nerves, so I need that
Fire shit, can't get no high shit
Type of shit got me coughin' soon as I light this shit
Puff, puff give
No nigga, roll up your own shit
I'm a certified pothead
So you never got that ass while my eyes red
Cali weed got me higher than a forklift
But you know my heart beat that New York shit
Fuck liftin' weights all I smoke is strong
Put a towel by the door, cover the smoke alarm (Mr. Weedman)
Yeah, 'cause I ain't tryna get kicked out
I pay a extra 200 for smokin' this bitch out
Buy it by the pound, smoke it by the zip
Smoke it to the roach, I don't need no clips

[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Weedman
I say what have you got to smoke?
I need a good drip, throw the crip, plus fire ass shit
A good weed that will make me choke
Hey Mr. Weedman
I say what have you got to smoke?
I need a good drip, throw the crip, plus fire ass shit
A good weed that will make me choke
Hey Mr. Weedman

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I am the man who got what you need and this is fo' sho
So don't need to check for, I'll get you a spaz
They say a good thing don't last
So hustle up on the zipper, a gram by gram
Really don't serve that, holla at the door
He know where the herb at, a nervous burn that you need
Come to Californa where they legalize weed
Like damn, boom fly, boy Cancun
Living so good, nigga got his own broom room
Stood up most of us, well I say both of us
Ayo Santana, get your niggas and smoke with us

[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Weedman
I say what have you got to smoke?
I need a good drip, throw the crip, plus fire ass shit
A good weed that will make me choke
Hey Mr. Weedman
I say what have you got to smoke?
I need a good drip, throw the crip, plus fire ass shit
A good weed that will make me choke
Hey Mr. Weedman

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Drop it, bag it, fresh off the plants, I gotta have it
Too big for the Ziploc, I'm talkin' acres
Only smoke KK but Young Khalifa got flavors
Turkey bad boys, niggas smokin' bullshit, don't make me laugh
Blow it all, hold her head, hell that is
Little nigga try to smoke with Wiz
And if under the table wasn't able
To handle a lethal dose so it got fatal
You ain't do it man, the kush made you
Ain't got no credit to now save you
Never violate you
Brought me one, I'm tryna blaze through

[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Weedman
I say what have you got to smoke?
I need a good drip, throw the crip, plus fire ass shit
A good weed that will make me choke
Hey Mr. Weedman (yeah, you know I got it)
I say what have you got to smoke? (whatever you need)
I need a good drip, throw the crip, plus fire ass shit (yeah, yeah)
A good weed that will make me choke (all the time)
Hey Mr. Weedman (you can call me that baby)

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
I got that green
I got that orange, the purple, the kush
The trainwreck Ak-47
Obama, whatever you need, I'm talkin' 'bout
That kushington, yeah nigga
I'm the weedman, Snoop Dogg
Good looking out Santana
