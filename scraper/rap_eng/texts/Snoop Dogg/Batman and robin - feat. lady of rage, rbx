To the Batmobile, let's go
Atomic batteries to power
Turbines to speed
Roger, ready to move out
No one can save the day like Batman
Robin will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin' crime
No one can save the day like Batman
Commissioner X here
Batman and Robin, we have a bit of a problem
There's trouble brewing in Gotham City
You must act fast
Holy mackerel Batman, I think these clowns need a back hand
Let's be the Gap Band and drop the bomb on 'em
And make 'em scat man
When you say "scat man" like the brother called brother
When it's on, it's cold, so bring the coroner cover
We can take it to the basement, live with Tigger
Go get The Riddler, to watch me play that nigga like a fiddler
On a hot tin roof, I got them watchin who?
She who spits it like she was sippin' rotten brew, ooh
We Marvel at you Comics, you ain't no Superhero
You just a stupid zero, you ain't hard like DeNiro
Surprise, The Dynamic Duo
Batman and Robin, gats set for squabbin'
Splat, hit 'em like forty-five shells
Plat, means more than one million sales
That's nuff shot to lick, you get done up
Plus we got the Bat gats, so why would you run up?
Batman, Batman, Batman
And you're about to find out
No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin' crime
No one, can save the day like Batman
And you're about to find out
Yeah, when it's beef in Gotham City I, gots to flip and
Hit 'em with the pow, bam, biff, whoa
Pick up your lips, don't trip, tie your shoelace
When I spit, I split it, turn Harvey Dent into Two-Face
Robin, I'm more than a sidekick, I'm more like the livest
They wanna go head up and collide
And like collision, hope your moms made provisions
See, you ain't got no wins baby, not even a smidgen
Mad hostility dealt, now I'ma really be felt
Switch on my utility belt, make yo' facility melt
I go Mad on yo' Hatter, watch yo' whole shit splatter
Get wicked on yo' case like Detective Van Adder
So the, sayin' goes, if you snooze you lose
Trust you do, me and Batman the Dynamic Two
No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin' crime
No one, can save the day like Batman
Cold day in Gotham in the Bat Cave chillin'
Catnip for Catwoman so she caught the feelin'
Huh, talk about flavor for a Pringle
A favor for a favor maybe later we can mingle
Damn, just then, the Bat Phone ringin'
They hoo-bangin' in Gotham, I got to do my thing
Batman, war is on the brink
It seems that the Penguin is causing a stink
Call up Robin quick, you know what to do
Add dye to the water and splash the town blue
Shit I'm there in a flash, Batmobile on 3's
Trust me buddy, got heat for Mr. Freeze
And Clayface will catch the embrace
Of napalm when I drop my Bat Bomb
And don't you forget it
Takin' out you suckers and you don't know how I did it
No one can save the day like Batman
Robin will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin' crime
No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin' crime
Dirty Dinkins Batman
Did you see those crispy khaki creases on that rugged wretched?
Aiy-yo-yo-yo kick back Robin
Get Alfred and tell him to have barbecued buffalo wings
And a pitcher of Kool-Aid on chill
It's about to get real in the field
Leapin' Lo-lo's, over there Batman, that's a no-no
Let's hop out this fo'-do'
Yeah yeah yeah, systems engaged
Start the Bat Engine, hit the Bat Switches
You ready Robin? Let's dip
Let's dip! Holy Hoodrat Sally smokin' crack in the alley
Let's dip! I mean, crazy kinfolk in Kingsville Batman!
We must, we must Batman! Listen to me
Holy Leapin' Lizards and Gizzards and all that shit that come with it
And potatoes on top with gravy in the middle
Goddamn it Batman
Batman!
