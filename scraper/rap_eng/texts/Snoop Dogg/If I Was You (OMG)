[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I bet you wake up in the morning and you kiss yourself
Cause I would, if I was you
I bet you show up to the club and just dance with yourself
Cause I would, if I was you

[Prohgress]
If I was you girl
Here is what I'd do girl
I'd notice me here at this table, with my crew girl
We sipping goose girl
We getting loose girl
So won't you sit up on my lap with that caboose girl
Shake it out

[Bridge: Far East Movement]
You ain't a dime, you's a silver dolla
It'll be a crime, if I didn't holla
Take a second, hear me out
If you still don't get it, let me spell it out

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Far East Movement]
O-M-G, you're so sexy
You know you caught my eye with a B-O-O-T-Y
O-M-G, shawty's such a freak
She says she wants to go back to my C-O-N-D-O
Let's go
Let's go

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I bet you hop under the covers and play with yourself
Cause I would, if I was you
I bet you stand up in the mirror and stare at yourself
Cause I would, if I was you

[J-Splif]
If I was you girl
It be me and you girl
Would be no question, teach you lessons in my room girl
And if you with it girl, then you can get it girl
And if you thinkin' it, let's start drinkin', let it go girl
Check it out

[Bridge: Far East Movement]
You ain't a dime, you's a silver dolla
It'll be a crime, if I didn't holla
Take a second, hear me out
If you still don't get it, let me spell it out

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Far East Movement]
O-M-G, you're so sexy
You know you caught my eye with that B-O-O-T-Y
O-M-G, shawty's such a freak
She says she wants to go back to my C-O-N-D-O
Let's go

[Verse 3: Prohgress]
Oh my God you’re so damn fine
Move them hips from side to side
Oh my God you’re so damn cute
Make me give up all my loot
Let's go

[Bridge: Far East Movement]
You ain't a dime, you's a silver dolla
It'll be a crime, if I didn't holla
Take a second, hear me out
If you still don't get it, let me spell it out

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Far East Movement]
O-M-G, you're so sexy
You know you caught my eye with a B-O-O-T-Y
O-M-G, shawty's such a freak
She says she wants to go back to my C-O-N-D-O
Let's go
