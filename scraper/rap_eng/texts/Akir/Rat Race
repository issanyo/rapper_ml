AKIR - “Rat Race”
[Emcee(s): AKIR]
[Producer(s): [?]]

[Verse 1: AKIR]
TECs, checks to bless.  Vexed sex with stress
Intangible gains arranged, my pockets dead from debts
My pain stems deep.  In abyss, I can’t sleep
New York king complete.  Battle filled the concrete
Trying to make ends meet, but they got fury with each other
One is my delegate and the other is my brother
Cream said they was men until they never flipped kids
Taking the rent money, so these niggas got addicted
He gave it to this bitch on his dick [?]
Didn’t give a fuck about D’s.  She had kids to feed
My mother tells me, “Get together with your man mind”
He’s lost, I can’t find son.  I know he’s in jail
Every time I look for him, my mom’s got to post bail ‘cause it’s
A rat race and the movement’s quick, sucker
A voice said, “Watch your back, son, and the counterfeit
Get the money up front [?]”
[?] and the New York mental ‘cause it’s
A rat race.  It’s a rat race, son
It’s a rat race.  It’s a rat race, son
It’s a rat race.  It’s a rat race, son

[Verse 2: AKIR]
Motivation from my mans to get the crew back to old times
[?] rhyming in the park
Body want to dance if mind with the lyrics
Hard to pump up, dividing his soul to freak the gifted
That nigga hard, he rest in parts—the first to get blasted, B
Days before, I told him ‘bout this cat named reality
Coming out his crib, silhouette by the streetlights
On the way to meet his shorty—yo, you know that street life
They was just getting started, didn’t even see the dadas
All of a sudden, linked in drama—life as real as baby mama
Before they cut his [?] bucked him in the brain
Ever since [?] and it ain’t never been the same
But he played off and kept it thriving in the struggle
Out of them all, my best friend’s soul is constantly
In trouble, on the run [?]
[?]

[Hook: AKIR]
It’s a rat race, son
It’s a rat race.  It’s a rat race, son
It’s a rat race.  It’s a rat race, son
It’s a rat race.  It’s a rat race, nigga

[Verse 3: AKIR]
Thought he grew up.  Even though a nigga been through it
Nicotine lungs, a liver that’s done—scars to prove it
Took a walk about it [?] and left his mans and it
Felt like a zombie pumping with no hands and it
[?] hurry to write a check
He’s hoping that his latest rhyme’ll bring him out of debts
Getting strong, him and his pops getting along
“Keep your enemies, your friends”—lyrics from his newest song
Survivalist, he thrives and just to bring ‘em all together
Unite in one form what makes your heart last forever
Time goes on, the song prolongs
The lifetime that belongs and how we all say, “Dawg”
Through the bitches in heat, through the ditches and beef
Through the switches that lock bars and biting with your teeth
[?] one last message to my mens:
It’s a rat race.  Let’s stack the cheddar ‘til the end
