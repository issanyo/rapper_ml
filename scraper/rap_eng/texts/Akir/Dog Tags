[Intro:]
The larger global capitalist world is beginning to disintegrate. The Outstanding measures are backfiring . The banks and the big corporations are more and more being exposed for their weaponizing of greed, losing sight of poor people especially the precious children of all color and all nations. It can be in Greece or it can be in Portugal. It can be in Harlem, it can be in Los Angeles or it can be in Puerto Rico. We're talking about a global system

[Verse 1:]
I just received word, my cous had a stillborn
You know my heart feels torn
If theres anything to do to bring that girl back I'll kill for em
But me and god we like, turn away and kill on
Diego and Frida, Iteina My baby cousin in the sky now I can't reach her
She in paradise playing in extravagant mansions
We on earth looking hurt like Marilyn Manson
My other cousin turned heroine addict damn
She was a 801 habit
You see her pops was a phine and he died on halloween
From the very same thing, she inherited that shit
We use to laugh at the stereo blasting
Now I'm crying hysterical, damn it, Where is yo casket
Got no tomb stone, just a box and a few bones
That and 32, three kids and a group home

[Chorus:]
Danger zone
When you feel you getting older
When yo heart grow colder getting closer to the danger zone
If you made it as a youth life is sacred
You the truth, God bless you, you can hold your own
Nah, to kill one is a terrible sin
Everyone tryna find a revolution within
But the mind of a child is where it begins

[Verse 2:]
My girl late at night talking bout a cabbage pastor
Duh, small me, poor me, I never had a dad
I set a border, she ignore it
She ain't having that
She miscarried, put the corpse in a plastic bag
Showed it to me, all fleshy like a fleshy like a chicken strip
Uncooked, She gave a strong look cuz I ain't give a shit
I said fuck it, take that tadpole and flush it
We dont have to discuss it, seen it happen to buttons
I'm a asshole, So what? of your motherly bond
Next time I'll make sure that the rubber stay on
See, I don't hurt, I don't feel
And tha birth control pills damage the gall bladder
Dammit it don't matter
I gather some raw data read it in freakonomics
Aborting kill the crime rate, I'm just being honest
Now every night I can't sleep, dreams being haunted by that very same shit
Chave been us seeing each other’s, man it’s

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
A crazy man went shooting in a school building
Killed 12 kids, now who would execute children?
But in Palestine, phosphorous materials fall from the sky
Vapourize the schools terribles
And what about bombs dropping out a aerial drone
Over a child's home, not the same scenario?
When it comes to other's suffer we think nothing of it
When it comes to us, suddenly its a touchy subject
Look what happened to the Russians with the Chechie gunning
Damn babies man, its crazy what's the world's becoming
Military industrial complex product
Mass production of firearms consume the culture
American violence, poor schools and dumb soldiers
A country of gun owners and blood donors
The rich sit back, sip they cup soda
Brown youth shoot each other down, we getting fucked over

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
They say that if you love somebody
They spirit always follows you
For myself I’m feelin sorry
I’ll get yo picture in a badge
They sat that death is not the end
But when will I see you again
A baby is my only friend
The only thought of you I have
They say that if you love somebody
They never really go away
Even traveling without a body
Or to have to do without a space
Still can’t believe you’re gone
It makes me wanna end it all
For my kid I gotta carry on
But I don’t wanna live alone
Makes me wanna end it all
For my kid I gotta carry on
