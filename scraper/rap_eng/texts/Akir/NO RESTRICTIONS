VERSE 1:

What up baby
Got the feeling you my dream lady
Drive me crazy
Make me wanna dance like the 80’s
You just may be
More than miss lately
I hold you safely
You been wit  some weak dudes
Them dudes ain't me
Been wit some fine women
It seems the vibe was missin
You say that them young cats
Is thirsty
Tryna hit it
While the older ones you deal wit
Think they own you cause they trickin
And you just wanna chill wit no restrictions
Yeah I get it
See
I listen while
The wine sippin
Makes your eyes glisten
And your refined diction
Eloquence
Defines vision
I’m impressed my empress
I find wisdom
In a package romantic
Frantic for thigh lickin
Gimmie that alive feelin
With your grind friction
Make a n**** wanna sleep like a time difference
When we reach for the stars
Seems like the skies risen
I found Heaven in Earth
It got my mind trippin

HOOK:

It don’t happen everyday
All choked up
Cause I wanted to I
Offer you no restrictions
I wanna have no restrictions
You turned and you walked away
Came right back
Cause you wanted to play
Hey
You wanna have no restrictions
I offer you no restrictions

VERSE 2:

Its thrillin to feel
Exhilaration Mama
Startin to build this foundation comma
My secrets revealed you have faith in honor
I take stake in the deal
If I can be your partner
Wit a shorty thats real
But stays away from drama
Wit the looks that could kill
Cause I believe in Karma
Turn around
Lemme murder that maximus
Go head back it up
You love when I smack it rough
Back to the convo
Heres a toast
To being far from lonely
Hopefully close
To the love that we want
And purposely chose
To trust and protect with the rest of our soul
So for now we can just enjoy company
Kick back and laugh
Fit together comfortably
The flower to my honey bee
Theres no need for the subtleties
Its time or you to come with me

HOOK:

It don’t happen everyday
All choked up
Cause I wanted to I
Offer you no restrictions
I wanna have no restrictions
You turned and you walked away
Came right back
Cause you wanted to play
Hey
You wanna have no restrictions
I offer you no restrictions

VERSE 3:

I’m glad I met ya
My duty is not to catch ya
I truly
Just wanna get to the beauty inside ya center
Aggressor obsessors
That rudely would try to step to ya
Loosely like you were lessor
Than human
Are now no question
I step to countessa
And do my best to interest ya
This is more than finesse hun
This is action and big fun
You sharp dresser
Remind me of the old Vanessa Williams
While other women be looking like they ate a raw
Lemon
Life is hard like starched denim and god given
You break it down to be thankful cause we are livin
You got goals for your future
Theres no far limits
And all this is the shit that makes me want
Children
My friends say that I’m illin for all these honest
Feelings
And that
I should be careful dealing with smart vixens
But theres no pressure
I just wanted to fess up
So come and get this
No strings attached
No restrictions

HOOK:

It don’t happen everyday
All choked up
Cause I wanted to I
Offer you no restrictions
I wanna have no restrictions
You turned and you walked away
Came right back
Cause you wanted to play
Hey
You wanna have no restrictions
I offer you no restrictions

No restrictions…
