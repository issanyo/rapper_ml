[9th Prince]
Aiyo, I make classic tunes, Killarmy, we the last platoon
My pen ignite the light whenever I write in a dark room
My rhyme be formin' out my mouth
But I don't ryhme like I'm from the South
Drunk off Guiness Stout, 95 Route
Re-energize my clout whenever I'm out and about
I target all you analog cats dressed in all black
I Starr like Fredro whenever I'm strapped
Swing bats, never laugh, I'm a mack
Valour Gucci hat, I told The RZA, "I'm bringin' Wu-Tang back"
Feel the rapture when I capture all smackers
Verbal back slasher, pull out my blade faster
'94 flow, tour from '94 with no flaw
Still raw to the core, wire ya jaw
That's my law, but still you never saw
Now you layin' on the floor
Screamin', "9th Prince don't hurt me, no more!"

[Chorus: 9th Prince]
Aiyo, rappers wanna beat me but can't see me
There's no cure for my rap disease
I need that S dot Carter money
That Wu-Tang Killa Bee honey
Fame, power and fast cars and snow bunnies
Rappers wanna beat me but can't see me
There's no cure for my rap disease
I need that S dot Carter money
That Wu-Tang Killa Bee honey

[AR.Change.L]
First four moves, first strike
Don't wait for his chance, first dance, yo I'm out for first place
Second round knockout, they fell for the bait
Tried to second guess me but they so second rate
I'm third rail, tryin' to touch me is so dumb
Cuz I wrote all on the Third Rock from the Sun
Come forth if you disagree, want some?
Like the fourth of July, I'm in the pen done/Independent
And so drunk like I drank a fifth of Vodka
Who's the illest? I plead the fifth, your honor
I got a Sixth Sense like dead folks habla
Heal odd six, verbal, ya want nada
I bring the drama, like 7th Heaven
The eighth wonder of the world, I am destined
I'm taking it all, break the ninth commandment
Me and 9th Prince, son, choose ya weapon

[Chorus: AR.Change.L]
Rappers wanna beat me but can't see me
There's no cure for my rap disease
I need that S dot Carter money
That Wu-Tang Killa Bee honey
Fame, power and fast cars and snow bunnies
Rappers wanna beat me but can't see me
There's no cure for my rap disease
I need that S dot Carter money
That Wu-Tang Killa Bee honey

[Akir]
Aiyo, once upon a rhyme we were lookin' for sure
When the waves took us over, man vs. the flow
Shiny hooks to reel us in, others will puncture ya hole
So you had to latch on just to survive out the flow
So many treacherous sharks take advantage in dark
Tasted blood in the water, know his teeth so sharp
Orchestrated movements, mainstream ain't tuned with
All the beauty that's around, harmony, it sounds like a trip
But homey, I ain't get on that shit
Still robbin' 'em for bait, still makin' 'em hits
And they pullin' 'em strings, don't forget
Crows cling on their neck
Bottomfeeders looking for the catch, shellin' out
All the ends, fast gas with the Benz
I've gone so deep, guess it's time I ascend
Footprints in the sand, fuck sirens
Tell 'em King Neptune's in tune, trident
