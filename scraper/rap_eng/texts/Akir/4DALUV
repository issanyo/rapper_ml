AKIR ft. YG - “4DALUV”
[Emcee(s): AKIR and YG]
[Producer(s): [?]]

[Intro: AKIR and YG]
AKIR: Yeah, this goes out to all my emcees out there keeping it real.  But when you get a record deal, it seems like keeping it real might even be keeping it wrong.  In this fucked up world we live in.  Yo
YG: Whoo!  Come on.  One Enterprise on the rise.  They don’t understand, man.  These niggas don’t even know.  AKIR and YG.  Yeah, it’s classics, baby.  Yeah, yeah

[Hook: AKIR]
I do it for the love, man.  Not for the fame
Not for the chicks, the whips, or the change
Not for the two-ways to flip or the Range.  Yeah
I want to get paid, but I do it for the stage
I do it for the love, man.  Not for the fame
Not for the chips, the six, or the name
Not for the video flicks or accolades.  Yeah
I want to get paid, but I do it for the stage

[Verse 1: YG]
Heartbeat of
The streets—feel the energy—it’s therapeutic
Everybody got to hustle, but I’m used to it
Sleepwalking through the system, now we all victims
Of greed, money, and lust.  What happened to us?
Once a family that stuck together.  Torn apart ‘cause
Nowadays, it’s all about the cheddar, the chrome, twenty-inch
Rims, the Lex, Beemer, the Benz, [?]
When will it end, man?  Live from the block, you see them
Niggas making ends, selling poison to their neighbors
And friends, doing well, moving up the chain.  They got
Fly whips and things, a house on the hill, but still
Sell poison in the block, still trying to kill

[Hook: AKIR]
I do it for the love, man.  Not for the fame
Not for the chicks, the whips, or the change
Not for the two-ways to flip or the Range.  Yeah
I want to get paid, but I do it for the stage
I do it for the love, man.  Not for the fame
Not for the chips, the six, or the name
Not for the video flicks or accolades.  Yeah
I want to get paid, but I do it for the stage

[Verse 2: AKIR]
Ain’t shit gon’ change except my chains
Forgets my chain, never gets those chains
Respect my age and accept my wage through the
Roads we’ve paved.  No, we won’t be slaves
Help my homie so we won’t be slinging.  For your
Own peace, say what’s real, for Pete’s sakes
Roll grass while in the dirt to see snakes.  Don’t
Hold back, say what you feel like handshake.  From the
Def Jam, whenever you can, have you read, man?
There’s no limit to the gifted mind.  You master
Your P’s and Q’s.  Boy, you’re bad and it’s big news
Fellows rock to your tunes, chicks roll J’s, mimic-
-ing the words that you say ‘cause it play all day
Radio airplay, windows, and hallways
It’s time that we rocked ‘til the time stopped.  Live
From the block, it’s hot like rock on a wild block
So don’t stop the art just ‘cause you climbed the chart
Reach inside the part that’s deep inside your heart
Make a beat that made you hungry to eat, that made you
Excited, ignited while you out on the street, that made you
Scared to rip, that made you proud to spit a blessing
Sent to all the people.  Your God’s giving gift

[Interlude 1: AKIR and YG]
AKIR: Your God’s giving gift.  Yeah.  To all my emcees out there
YG: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayyo

[Hook: AKIR]
I do it for the love, man.  Not for the fame
Not for the chicks, the whips, or the change
Not for the two-ways to flip or the Range.  Yeah
I want to get paid, but I do it for the stage
I do it for the love, man.  Not for the fame
Not for the chips, the six, or the name
Not for the video flicks or accolades.  Yeah
I want to get paid, but I do it for the stage
