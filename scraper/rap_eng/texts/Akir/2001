[Verse 1: AKIR]
Yo, yo, take a swig of rhyme Remy, creative juice loose
Street-smart, apple-shaped heart, Timberland boots
Breakbeat boost chronic-induced while my larynx
Short fuse, antagonized by unlimited juice.  Tipping
The ladders, bottle full throttle, time's getting monotonous
Through New York metropolis, running through chick populace
Tired of making sense/cents while my dollars don't work
Rich but rock riches religiously, horses on shirts
Catching feelings for this rap shit—every song hurts
Connecting pieces of the puzzle, in the struggle, I learnt
For everyone that I found, one either drowned or burnt
Addicted to chicks, friction, herbals, or tables that turnt
What is the sound of underground without people around?
What is New York without Uptown holding it down?
