AKIR - “Survive”
[Emcee(s): AKIR]
[Producer(s): [?]]

[Verse 1: AKIR]
Elders say, “Keep your focus,” smirk and say I’m hopeless
Addict for greenbacks, rubber bands over mean stacks
I’ma get it—I mean that—like coke where the fiends at
Supplying, multiplying, lying up in a mean shack
Ten rooms of fire, place, and a mean act
Super fly, she’s live ass and a mean rack
Drive you out of your mind, back up, and truck
Call me the Mack, speeding behind until I reach my peace of mind
This peace of mind?  Plan to protect it with a piece of mine
Fuck around, blow out a piece of your mind.  It’s hard
Work, nigga [?].  Musical
Artwork.  Soon as I reach, I’ll climb.  There’s no
Stopping on four fours.  Like bowlegged, low
Just watch the move, don’t ask me why I do what I do
Back the fuck up while these live niggas step through
Back the fuck up while these live niggas step through

[Hook: AKIR]
Stay alive, nigga, ‘cause man is not the only to
Survive, nigga.  And so we keep this fire
Deep inside, nigga.  Without it, you will wither up
And die, nigga.  Stay alive, nigga.  To all
My live niggas, only few is prepared
To die, nigga.  Pick up your people, then go ahead
And ride, nigga.  Get live, nigga
Survive, nigga.  Stay alive, nigga

[Verse 2: AKIR]
Stated as simple as I can, I am only one man.  In this
Grand scheme of things, about as small as an ant, holding
The dreams of those who believed but didn’t achieve, addicts
Pimps, and thieves who breathe by these tricks up their sleeves
Niggas in prison see their living through survival as creed.  Only
Eighteen, serving fiends and had his mom signing deeds
To her new house, bank accounts, to the scenes with the cream
You know the scene, same routine: judges gave him eighteen.  And you
Could see the repercussions through the bums on the street.  Head on
Their shoulders, falling over, they can’t get on their feet.  It’s hard
To balance when the foulness hits ya.  Elders say, “Read the scripture”
I say, “Do whatever fits ya.”  I’ll pray, I’ll play my part
It’s at the end of motion picture.  Type twenty-three to plot
Changes with the age, kid.  Getting these papers to
Finance me rocking stages.  I’ll get patient, then change
Switch: dental pair, health care, and paychecks

[Hook: AKIR]
Stay alive, nigga, ‘cause man is not the only to
Survive, nigga.  And so we keep this fire
Deep inside, nigga.  Without it, you will wither up
And die, nigga.  Stay alive, nigga.  To all
My live niggas, only few is prepared
To die, nigga.  Pick up your people, then go ahead
And ride, nigga.  Get live, nigga
Survive, nigga.  Stay alive, nigga

[Verse 3: AKIR]
Yo, yo, some decide to play games, some decide to take aim
Some decide to dickride, piggyback off somebody’s fame
Some’ll pray on the weak, some’ll wait for defeat
Some’ll wait for the chance to knock you off your fucking feet
Challenge your balance, watch you fall in the street, pick up
Your keys and run you over with your own SUV.  I’ll keep
An eye open, sleep, make sure the sky’s over me ‘cause when
You over the sky, it’s over, you die.  Time
Will tell my destiny more that equity.  I want my people
To love and respect me in the struggle ‘til I’m stress-free
These thoughts are serious and much more than lyrical
Modern-day negro spirituals, contemporary biblical
There’s a lot in this world.  You might not be the dopest.  Stay
Focused, always keep an eye on your peripherals
No telling what these niggas’ll do.  Don’t get sidetracked
My niggas.  Ayyo, just do you

[Hook: AKIR] (x2)
Stay alive, nigga, ‘cause man is not the only to
Survive, nigga.  And so we keep this fire
Deep inside, nigga.  Without it, you will wither up
And die, nigga.  Stay alive, nigga.  To all
My live niggas, only few is prepared
To die, nigga.  Pick up your people, then go ahead
And ride, nigga.  Get live, nigga
Survive, nigga.  Stay alive, nigga
