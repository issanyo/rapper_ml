AKIR - “One”
[Emcee(s): AKIR]
[Producer(s): Southpaw]
[Sample: Kenny Loggins ft. Stevie Nicks - "Whenever I Call You ‘Friend’"]

[Intro: AKIR]
You know when something just feels right.  Nah’mean?  And you just got to make it right.  I’d like to dedicate this one to everybody who was here at one point and might have left but invested their time and energy and long, hard years of sweat to make this thing happen.  I’d like to thank everybody who ever supported us and understands where we’re going with this message in the music.  It’s like this, yo

[Verse 1: AKIR]
One Enterprises comprises the artist and the sound
The pen and paper play my savior while I'm getting down
Pray for my neighbors as a favor for holding me down
Slave for my papers as I savor the weight of their pounds
It's underground, but the blatant vibrations widely found
Facing a nation, complacent radio stations now
Stop hesitating and contemplating the way we patient
Start motivating and get them playing the shit we saying
Ain’t no delaying in this war that we’re getting slayed in
'Cause time's a-wasting while we stand adjacent to abrasions
Their fouls is more than flagrant, and so I see the prisons’
Cages while I pound the pavement, looking for payment, saying
"Fuck enslavement!"  Using the tools of old ancients
Announcing my engagement to this music that we making
Ain’t no faking on tracks and we don’t never come wack
Yo, this is One Enterprises and that is a wrap

[Hook: AKIR]
One love, one music
One people, one movement
One heart, one spark
One, One, One, One
One gift, one lift
One stance, one shift
One God, one squad
One, One, One, One, One

[Verse 2: AKIR]
Walking through the valley in the shadows of beats
Talentful peeps balancing sleep, accounting for weeks.  Meanwhile
Hustling beasts rustle in streets, hushing the speech
People rushing to see if we’s as tough as can be
Remarkably deep, twenty thousand leagues up under the sea
Over the trees, plan to keep a dance with that ease
Suddenly, the vibration force a nigga to breathe
Watching footprints in the sand blow away in a breeze
Got on my knees and pray to God that we succeed together
Clever trendesetters with a vendetta to make it better
No matter the weather, we forever be wetter in all endeavors
(One love, one music, one movement forever)

[Hook: AKIR]
One love, one music
One people, one movement
One heart, one spark
One, One, One, One
One rhyme, one time
One light, one shine
One way one day
One, One, One, One, One
One love, one music
One people, one movement
One heart, one spark
One, One, One, One

[Outro: AKIR]
Yeah.  Uh, uh, one love, one music, one movement
