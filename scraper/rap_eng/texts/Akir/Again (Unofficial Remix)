[Intro]
[Sample Quote from “Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood”]
[Ashtray’s Mother]
I don’t want you hanging out in the streets.  I want you to finish school.  ‘Cause without an education, the only kind of work you’re gonna get is selling drugs, pimping women, or working security for Eddie Murphy.  Now, I’ve done all I can.  I got my education, I worked two jobs to support you.  But I can’t teach you how to be a man.  Now, give me a kiss and be a good boy

[Akir]
Again?  Big shout to John Legend.  It’s Akir.  We dedicate this to everybody with they eyes on the prize
[Statik Selektah]
Statik Selektah, Akir.  It’s “The Secret.”

[Verse 1 – Akir]
Song-writing again
Gotta show the industry I’m nice, lightning when I strike with the pen
Blao!  Getting older.  Just got sober.  But I’m drinking again
And we performing at ten.  And if she caught it to then
Hope I don’t fuck up my rhymes again
I got over.  Shit, I’m a soldier
I freestyle mean styles until the end
But I’m tired of performing the same shit
I had to get back on the street—the hustler’s language
And though I thought [?] time, my lane switch
Free shows, gotta eat mo’ the same shit
Promoting, still faking
I’m getting much love from my fam
But those close to the grams
Broke while they shaking my hand
So I explain who I am
They don’t give a fuck
Only shorty’s hitting me up
I wanna quit the nicotine, but
I light ‘em up again (light ‘em up)
And make progress to show change
But thug niggas go hard to the cage
My OG of old age
Complaining of wage.  Go back to old ways
Almost as slaves
I never, ever wanna have to say: goodbye

[Verse 2 – John Legend]
So I’ve got a new friend
I wish I could forget you but I miss you, wanna kiss you again
But she’s like you
But she not you
Gotta find you again
We remember again
The middle of the summer and I take you out to dinner again
Boy, I love her
It’s not over
‘Cause I love her again
