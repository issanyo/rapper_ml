AKIR - “Earthquake Hits”

[Intro: AKIR]
Let’s go.  Damn.  This world is filled with tragedies.  We at war with terrorists, buildings falling down.  Haha.  And babies going to bed hungry now.  And niggas killing niggas.  All over again

[Verse 1: AKIR]
Yo, earthquake hits, world erupts and splits, continental
Shift while the Earth axis splits.  Meanwhile
We’ll raise a mean child with fear in his heart.  Hits
The Colorado instance—we’re falling apart.  Yo, we should’ve
Listened to the Indians’ wisdom, followed the ways of nature
But, instead, we made our own system an ultraviolet prism
Where we practice hedonism, capitalistic
Conflict and democratic cannibalism.  If we
Only listened to the Rastafar rise through lifetime
Emulate the sky while they stay on smoking lye
Exhale some hill cess known for calming terminal illness
But we didn’t and further then explored the
Forbidden, partied the Marley composition.  But never
Heed the written.  Shit, if a nigga only listened to the
Hindu singing hints of Dalai Lama, maybe
Next time, the situation will be calmer if we just respect
Karma.  Overpopulating ourselves, safari
Gunshot shells bucking at a gazelle.  If it was
You, it’d be Hell.  Who’s child is really on the line?
Respect Mother Earth before we run out of time.  Uh

[Outro: AKIR]
What do y’all think is going on out here?  Neglecting the Earth.  Therefore, the Earth shall neglect you.  Take care of what’s yours, man.  God gave this for us so that we shall recreate and rise again.  And y’all sitting here, bickering about power.  Who got the power?  God got the power.  Don’t neglect that.  Never bite the hand that feeds you.  This goes out to all my little shorties out there.  Queen Isis.  My little nigga Tajae.  And my little girl Ashley.  Know’m saying?  Yeah.  I want to give a big shout-out to my man Big Noah, little Elizabeth, Jacob, Lindsey.  Y’all the future, man.  So you protect what’s yours.  One.  Yeah, uh
