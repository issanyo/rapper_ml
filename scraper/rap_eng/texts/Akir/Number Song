AKIR - “Number Song”

[Verse 1: AKIR]
One summer day, jumped out, dipped in a hallway
A seed too untrained, serving ‘caine on Broadway
Had it pouring like rain—cocaine the raw way
Throwing rocks in the war but didn’t know what it’s for
Laying deep in a ride while harassed by five
In a sick whip, stick shift, six-speed, sick shit
Hit the block about seven o’clock
Air Forces on the blacktop, trees in my sock
[?] fix me a plate.  It was late, but in
My face, I was hungry, so a nigga still ate.  Back on
The streets, still walking with The Beast and their nines.  Jumped in
A ride and reclined, feeling the world was mine
Roll a L and I picked up some wine ‘cause shorty’s fine
Likes to have a good time, plus she knows all my rhymes
To all my niggas: safe journey through the world and these crimes
Things come in due time—one—I’m out with the dime

[Verse 2: AKIR]
In one second, three amigos ran into the store
Pushed a negro, shot the gringo with a chrome forty-four
With the lingo [?] commanding his people
Through the dirt, we’ll grow rich from this root of evil
[?] at their ransack on Fifth Ave., stacked now
With a six NASDAQ.  Now they’re rich
One turn and revving.  The other Godbody known as seven
The last brethren caught his karma fast, passed to Heaven
He had a mill’.  This nigga stashed eight hundred
Thou’ with undisclosed account, plus in a stashed base
He hid it from his wife Tina, gave the codes to
His ho Nina when he was handling a misdemeanor
They ran up on Nina in a silver two-seater
Getting bent with no cheese, looking like she
O.D.  Here come the police.  Nina said they
Don’t mean.  To jail they were sent ten years for intent
