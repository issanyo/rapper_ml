AKIR ft. N.D.L. - “Hold You”
[Emcee(s): N.D.L. and AKIR]
[Producer(s): [?]]

[Verse 1: N.D.L.]
(Let me) hold you, never let go for nothing.  It’s only
Me and you tonight.  Let me show you something and let me
(Show you) Indeed, I’m slick ‘til death
When I get in the zone, peep how thick it gets, and I
Plan to stick with you ‘til death do us
But you know I gets to live now.  Let’s do this
Flip you ‘round, grip you, strip you down
Spit that real shit to you that gets you aroused
Got you peaking from every single word that I’m speaking
You flirt with emcees when I’m rocking it this weekend
Peeps is watching, crowding around, and
Getting loud and rowdy.  Got your mind in a cloud
So this is why and how we relate: you make my shit sound
Great, still my shorty from around the way.  No matter
Where we go, we still flow flawless
Love, I’ma show you regardless

[Hook: Sample from [?] - “[?]”]
Let me
Hold you.  I want to hold you
I want you in arms
I never want to let you go
(I’ll never let you go)
Show you.  I want to show you
All the magic that
I know you’ve never seen before
(I know you’ve never seen before)

[Verse 2: AKIR]
(Let me hold you) near to me
So you can hear me clearly speak
Frequently freaking frequencies.  You hear
That beat?  That’s our song—follow my lead
Glisten in the spotlight, you the love of my life
Transmitting my addiction ‘til the feeling is right
I’m gripping you tight, never want to let you go
Reset the tone, listen to me, help me flow (Let me)
Where there’s a show (Show you), there’s no ho
No amount of dough.  No matter the clothes or where a nigga go
You John Blaze.  My dame is center stage, huh
Taking me from minimum wage to front page
Taught me to stack heated and give me feedback
When I needed to lamp, I liked to get you amped, huh
Tired, your wire told me not to trip.  With no
Delay, I said, “OK,” and pulled you close to my lips

[Hook: Sample from [?] - “[?]”]
Let me
Hold you.  I want to hold you
I want you in arms
I never want to let you go
(I’ll never let you go)
Show you.  I want to show you
All the magic that
I know you’ve never seen before
(I know you’ve never seen before)

[Verse 3: AKIR]
(Let me hold you) Romancing
We dance in the dark.  Take my hand while we jam
To a band in the park.  And I remember the start
When melody was my heart.  Her jealousy broke us apart
I continue my art form, more forewarning
Your echo.  We’re young and petro.  I couldn’t let go
You got connections.  Shit is just electric to me
And I love you for life.  You my M-I-C

[Verse 4: N.D.L.]
(Let me show you) my life’s supplied in what the hype’s about
We got ‘em sights, steal women when the lights is out
I want to give it to you (All night)
Close, reeling ‘em in, it’s (All right)
Spit at men that’s seen it all: all types of brawls
[?] around my piece.  We all dough
Can’t wait to freak you.  It’s more than physical
I just want to speak to you, keep it lyrical

[Hook: Sample from [?] - “[?]”]
Let me
Hold you.  I want to hold you
I want you in arms
I never want to let you go
(I’ll never let you go)
Show you.  I want to show you
All the magic that
I know you’ve never seen before
(I know you’ve never seen before)
