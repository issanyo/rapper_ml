Everybody who hustle everyday to pay the rent

And what I represent
Who really give a f*ck
As long as I remember, I always had bad luck
And all my life I was f*cking, raised tough
My mother f*cking name
Ain't gonna be none
When I see that bitch lie, tell her
And all what they wanna do is lock a nigga up
And soon they see you living they try to take your stuff
Got
A face to twitter, there ain't
To take tear as they play us
But since they can't control us, they're trying to cage us
I'm playing for the niggas
Just keep hustling dog, you gonna make it
Salute to the nigga, that take you to the dough
And f*ck what they love you say
A nigga gotta go

She might pay 'em late, but she gonna hustle, it's a fact!

Convicted felon, but it's

My momma went rich, but I still f*cking love her

And every time I slide, they wanna
But when you're from the hood, that's how the f*cking do it
They can't stop the cash, I'm still getting to it
