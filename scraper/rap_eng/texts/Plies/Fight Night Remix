[Intro]
If you know me know this ain't my feng shui
Certified everywhere, ain't gotta print my resume
Talking crazy, I pull up andele
R.I.P to Nate Dogg, I had to regulate

Public Service Announcement
Where all my rich niggas at man?
MIGO!

[Hook: Takeoff]
Broke niggas stand to the left
My rich niggas stand to the right
Lil' mamma, she keep looking at me (lil' mama!)
Im'a knock the pussy out like fight night
Hit it with the left, hit with the right
Im'a knock the pussy out like fight night
Beat it with the left, beat it with the right
Im'a knock the pussy out like fight night

[Verse 1: Plies]
Nigga I walked up in the club with a rubba on
Fuck these bitches in the club, I don't bring em home
Nigga rob you before so we can't do a song
Told that bitch I wanna force em like a fuck-a-long
If she don't like it in her face I told them where ya going
If you don't like giving head then bitch leave me alone
Don't talk about dope on cell phones
I pour my liquor out for niggas who got snitched on
When my cuz came I told him I had a brick for em
Other cousin told em I ain't had shit for em
You gonna hug me in the club, I got my pistol
If you don't like me pussy ho write a diss song
Church

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
If you know me know this ain't my feng shui
Certified everywhere, ain't gotta print my resume
Talking crazy, I pull up andele
R.I.P to Nate Dogg, I had to regulate
Pocket rocket fire, watch him disintegrate
It's a truckload coming on the interstate
Sirloin steak all on my dinner plate
Your main bitch say she wanna make a sex tape
Rich nigga, I could never be a broke nigga (rich nigga)
Broke niggas I can never get along with them!
Always been hated since a little nigga (always)
It's forever pussy nigga gotta deal with it (rich nigga!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Float like a butterly, sting like a bee
Rumble young nigga rumble!
Lil' mamma want a nigga like me in the sheets
Ice cube knock it out like Deebo
Now who's that talking that gangsta shit?
Somebody gonna kick your ass
When I walk up in the club I better make a thunderstorm
Let them know that this a whole lot of cash
Rich niggas on the right all night (rich nigga)
Broke niggas to the left by yourself (brokanese)
Now who the hell just said that the roof on fire?
Call 911 like Wyclef

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Offset]
I'm a rich nigga, I don't like a bitch nigga
Nigga broke nigga, I don't deal with you
All of my niggas, official, My bitches they strippers
My niggas they criminals trying to get to the M&Ms
If your bitch is so innocent, why she sucking my children
Last time I asked I dine and dashed and bitch I go in the building
Bad bitch make it clap, let me know ya
Young rich nigga on the couch talking to Oprah
Bottles in the VIP while I stand on the sofa
I don't speak your language, Brokanese, I thought I told ya
These bitches they be smokin' on hookah, my nigga ballin' like Hoosiers
Geeked up in the Double R, I scare ya bitch, Freddy Krueger
Freddy Vermeulen
