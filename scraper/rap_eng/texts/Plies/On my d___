Bra if yo cash ain't right, right now dawg
Shit just fucked up right now dawg you done took
A lost when a bitch don't wanna give you nothin'
Dawg tellin' you dawg, you can make somethin' happen
My money lookin' funny nigga, just makin' it barely
Shit ain't how it use to be nigga, ain't frontin' the package
Gotta choke me a bitch outta somethin' I gotta have it
I'm on my dick dawg, I gotta make somethin' happen
My money lookin' funny nigga, just makin' it barely
Shit ain't how it use to be nigga, ain't frontin' the package
Gotta choke me a bitch outta somethin' I gotta have it
I'm on my dick dawg, I gotta make somethin' happen
When a nigga money fucked up it's hard for him to think straight
Seem like a nigga life in park when he ain't got cake
First thing that cross a bitch mind she gotta take
You can stay broke forever or you can make a shape
'Cause when you broke bitch talk to you any kinda way
You on ya dick bitch don't wanna here shit you gotta say
If you ain't built for this street shit then get out the way
'Cause when a nigga broke everybody's fuckin' prayin'
You either get money out there or you fuckin' hate
You think a nigga gone give you somethin' then keep waitin'
You better suck up yo motherfuckin' pride and chase it
'Cause when a nigga broke he ain't pose to have patients
My money lookin' funny nigga, just makin' it barely
Shit ain't how it use to be nigga, ain't frontin' the package
Gotta choke me a bitch outta somethin' I gotta have it
I'm on my dick dawg, I gotta make somethin' happen
My money lookin' funny nigga, just makin' it barely
Shit ain't how it use to be nigga, ain't frontin' the package
Gotta choke me a bitch outta somethin' I gotta have it
I'm on my dick dawg, I gotta make somethin' happen
I don't know if God tryin' to punish me or my luck just bad
I don't know which one of 'em it is but I need some fuckin' cash
I rather be in prison broke then out here without a stash
They say when it rains it pour then how will it last?
Before I let it rain on me I'm a let a bitch crash
With all black on chine five and ski mask
The streets judge off what you got not what you had
I took a lost and it hurt me fucked me up bad
It ain't no feelin' in the world like losin' ya last
I ain't got no choice I'm fucked up gotta bounce back
Seems like it take forever to get to get it but you can loose it fast
I rather a motherfucker visit me, sittin' behind a glass
My money lookin' funny nigga, just makin' it barely
Shit ain't how it use to be nigga, ain't frontin' the package
Gotta choke me a bitch outta somethin' I gotta have it
I'm on my dick dawg, I gotta make somethin' happen
My money lookin' funny nigga, just makin' it barely
Shit ain't how it use to be nigga, ain't frontin' the package
Gotta choke me a bitch outta somethin' I gotta have it
I'm on my dick dawg, I gotta make somethin' happen
The nigga that invented robbin' I bet he was broke
'Cause when you fucked up out here it ain't no fuckin' joke
And all bets off when a nigga money low
A nigga willin' to take chances he neva took before
And willin' to cross a motherfuckin' for the love of the dough
I can't fault nigga 'cause I done did that shit before
If you gone take it just be ready to play it how it go
It's every nigga for self this shit cut throat
I bet I past me a nigga for he past me tho
For every nigga ballin' it's a hundred niggas huntin'
I don't know if he told but these young niggas thuggin'
So why you outta ballin' it's some niggas ridin' lucky
My money lookin' funny nigga, just makin' it barely
Shit ain't how it use to be nigga, ain't frontin' the package
Gotta choke me a bitch outta somethin' I gotta have it
I'm on my dick dawg, I gotta make somethin' happen
My money lookin' funny nigga, just makin' it barely
Shit ain't how it use to be nigga, ain't frontin' the package
Gotta choke me a bitch outta somethin' I gotta have it
I'm on my dick dawg, I gotta make somethin' happen
