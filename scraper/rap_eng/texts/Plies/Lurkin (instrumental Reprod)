Advise niggas not to fuck with me

Don't leave no money around me
Welcome to, Clayton County

[Verse 3: Plies]
Guess what I did today
Pussy I just bought another stick
Guess I need to start working out
Cuz this bitch here, got a lot of kick
Do what I need y'all nigga to do
Ask me 'bout another bitch
Ask me 'bout a body
Some illegal shit, I plead the Fifth
250 rounds pussy thats the Al Qaeda shit
Ridin 'round in a rental car
Windows on it, I tint that shit
Stop hiding, duckin' and dodgin' nigga
Let's go get it over with
Headshots and closed caskets
I give my young niggas bonuses
Motherfuck the E.R
I'm tryin' to hit you permanent
Y'all niggas wanna talk it out
But me and my niggas want to burn the bitch
We lurkin'
Everybody got sticks on them
Lurkin'
We lurkin nigga all times of da morning

[Hook]
