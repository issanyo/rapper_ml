[Intro]
Man, what's up? This Plies, baby
The new nigga over here at Slip-n-Slide Records
Get comfortable, fuck nigga
I'm finna go ahead and introduce to y'all, man

[Chorus]
That's why I don't even worry 'bout y'all niggas
'Cause I know what I'd do to one of y'all niggas
I'd burn one of y'all niggas
And I'd kill every last one of you fuck niggas
That's why I don't even worry 'bout y'all niggas
'Cause I know what I'd do to one of y'all niggas
I'd burn one of y'all niggas
And I'd kill every last one of you fuck niggas

[Verse 1]
And if we go through something, nigga, I ain't hiding out
'Cause where it was swole at, nigga, I'm gon' hang out
I hope you got yours 'cause I got mine
And let's clear it up, nigga, I'm talking 'bout the fire
And old pussy ass nigga, I don't wanna talk now
So don't even waste your time pulling me to the side
'Cause I ain't gon' waste none 'cause I don't shoot in the sky
And y'all gon' make me fuck over one of y'all niggas
And y'all gon' make me whack one of y'all niggas
And I'ma get probation, first offense, nigga
Can I ask me a lawyer out in Dade that's gon' clear me, nigga
That's why I was free to kill one of you fuck niggas

[Chorus]
That's why I don't even worry 'bout y'all niggas
'Cause I know what I'd do to one of y'all niggas
I'd burn one of y'all niggas
And I'd kill every last one of you fuck niggas
That's why I don't even worry 'bout y'all niggas
'Cause I know what I'd do to one of y'all niggas
I'd burn one of y'all niggas
And I'd kill every last one of you fuck niggas

[Verse 2]
And all of them little fuck games, nigga, I don't even play 'em
You wanna tell me something, then tell me, nigga, and stop staying
'Cause you make me think you wanna do something
And I know everybody got big guns
I know niggas got killed that had big guns
And it's the first nigga to get to it, where I'm from
So all that staying there and watching me, nigga, it don't mean nothing
And if you gon' get burned, better get burned for something
'Cause I swear to God, nigga, you won't catch me, boy
And if I'm lying, nigga, your people ain't chilling
I'ma be in the club solo, motherfuck that
But what you don't know is I slid in the club with that
You got to make it to your car to even get that
I'll be outside, nigga, waiting in a deep tint
With a car full of choppers and you gon' fix that
One thing you niggas gon' do is get Plies' respect

[Chorus]
That's why I don't even worry 'bout y'all niggas
'Cause I know what I'd do to one of y'all niggas
I'd burn one of y'all niggas
And I'd kill every last one of you fuck niggas
That's why I don't even worry 'bout y'all niggas
'Cause I know what I'd do to one of y'all niggas
I'd burn one of y'all niggas
And I'd kill every last one of you fuck niggas

[Outro]
That's why I don't even worry 'bout y'all niggas, niggas, niggas, niggas
