[Intro:]
Ay dawg. if you lookin for plies in da club, know what I'm sayin
I'm easy to find bro. only thing u gotta look for is all da goons bro
I keep tellin ya'll dawg. I'm opposite all them niggas ya'll see on t.v. bro
I'm a tell u where I be at bro

[Chorus: x2]
I don't hang in da v.I.p. so stop checkin
I'm posted with da goons boppin, hand on weapon
In da corner with da thugs and convicted fellons
Lookin for me in the club, I'm in the thug section

[Verse 1:]
Wrong section, this ain't where da cris get poured
This where da pills get popped, dro get rolled
Where the thugs posted and ducks get soaked
Better keep ya head up and ya eyes open
Might not wanna chill over here if ya ain't totin
If we don't fuck with ya pussy nigga then keep floatin
We gettin loose a lil bit, but everybody focused
Cause everybody on yack and every body scopin
Keep a unit in my face and back against the wall
And hand on fire in case I gotta get off
Ain't nothin over here for ya but problems dawg
Surrounded by all hood bitches, no model brawds

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2:]
