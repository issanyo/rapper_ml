[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin n grindin up on that pole
I kno u see me lookin' at you and you already kno
I wanna fuck you, you already know, i wanna fuck you, you already kno

[Verse 1: Plies]
I wanna sit u ????
And show u what a real nigga wit money do
I'm caked up and well respected wit shit to prove
To be straight up with cha I wanna fuck u
I'm a street nigaa so u kno I ain't ???
Want u to bust it open so I can drop tht dick in ya
I'm thug nd x-rated plus I'm a real nigga
I wanna lay tht pussy I dont want ur fone numba
I wanna take u to the crib and fuck u to sleep
I let u get a lil rest and wake u up and beat
I bet a stack u ain't met a nigga fuck betta than me
And I have bitches swear 2 god I was on three

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Snoop]
Money in the air as mo feel grad you by your coat tail take you to the motel, hoe sale
Dont tell, won't tell, baby said I dont talk dogg but she told on me, oh well
Take a picture wit me, what the flick gon do, baby stick to me & ima stick on u
If u pick me then ima pick on you, d-o-double g and im here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy n urs is right, wrip ridinin them poles and them doors is tight
And ima get me a shot for the end of the night cuz pussy is pussy and baby ur pussy for life

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Plies]
Let me fill u up wit liquor and fuck it out cha
Lay u flat on ur back and get tht noise out ya
Feel it in ya stomach tearin tht back up out cha
I wanna hear u moan baby I wanna hear u holla
Dont worry about ya hair do I'll shoot u a few dollas
Just when u start ridin me get on them toes for me
I dont like a quiet fuck so tell me how u want it
U needa act like its yurr dick while u on it
I kno I'mma freak baby nd im luvin dat
Now I needa get u on the same level where im at
But when I get ya out there ain't no turnin back
And I'mma take u from likin' it to lovin sex

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Plies]
And if the pussy good I'll fuck ya a week straight
And meet ya at ya crib and fuck u on ya lunch break
Cuz I'mma stay up in dat pussy till ur numb babe
And put tears in yur eyes and a smile on ya face
Gimme dat pussy one time thts all it takes
And I'mma treat u like a big girl okayy
And I can tell u even then i can see ya legs shake
And at tht point imma give it to u all the way
Cuz I'mma make u wanna fuck me erryday
Fuck me at ya own risk is wht I'm tryenna say
Cuz I'mma have ur nose? wide open after dis
Nd make ur panties get wet wen u think about the dick
U wanna leave me alone but u can't quit
Wheneva I ain't in that pussy u feel sick
The more times I get it the better it get
So next time u see me think about dis

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Akon]
Shorty I can see u ain't lonely handfull of niggas n they all got cheese
So u lookin at me now whats it gonna be just another tease far as I can see
Tryin get u up out this club if it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin bout 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that cuz I'm far from a scrub
U kno my pedigree, ex-deala use to move phetamines
Girl I spend money like it dont mean nuthin n besides I got a thing for u

[Chorus]

[Verse 6: Snoop]
Mobbin' through club in low pressin im sittin in the back in the smokers section (just smokin)
Birds eye, I got a clear view, you can't see me but I can see u (baby I see u)
Its cool we jet the mood is set
Your pussy is wet u rubbin your back and touchin your neck
Ur body is movin' u humpin' n jumpin' ur titties is bouncin' u smilin' n grinin' n lookin at me

[Verse 7: Akon]
Girl n while your looking at me im ready to hit the caddy right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy
Baby u got a phatty the type i like to marry wantin to just give u everythin n thats kinda scary
Cuz I'm lovin the way you shake your ass , bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Lil' mully dont get caught up to fast but i got a thing for you

[Chorus x2]
[Akon:] Girl...
