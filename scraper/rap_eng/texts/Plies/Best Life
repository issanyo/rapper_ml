[Chorus]
I'm designed to live my best life
I'm designed to live my best life
I'm designed to live my best life
I'm designed to live my best life

[Verse 1]
Every time I turn around they throwing shots at the kids
I ain't tore ass which I'm putting a bag on ya ass
I just threw me one bag got me punching on the gas
Little niggas talking crazy making niggas spaz
I just threw me one near she got shots in her ass
Been the fuck and send her home call my folks on the cash
I was never the type of nigga to put the pussy before the bag
On my road to the riches nigga I came from the rags
I'm a Pakistan nigga I might be laying in your grass
Took a bitch out my phone called the little pussy with trash
You can hate me you can insult me but you can't ever make me mad
It's hard to make a nigga mad when a nigga work this much cash
Got it deep in my safe gotta nigga feeling blessed
You got pressure with the pussy you gotta hold it get it off your chest
Bitch I'm balling right now give a damn who got next
Went from chasing cars serving nigga to hopping on jets
I got blues and air pockets look nigga ain't cripping
Couple niggas wanna beat me but they won't say it but I ain't tripping
Got the glitz on me now hell no I ain't slipping
2018 I'ma have a lot of you niggas in your fillers

[Chorus]
I'm designed to live my best life
I'm designed to live my best life
I'm designed to live my best life
I'm designed to live my best life

[Verse 2]
Got a 25 next up in niggas
Got a hoe so exotic when you see her she like a genie
When these niggas go broke you fuck niggas turn to demons
Hoe suck me so good last night thought I was dreaming
Get the paper lil nigga hell yeah get the paper
Same thing my brother told me when he violated the papers
I fuck and I seize it but I'd never change her
You had me out saying nothing so to me you replacement
Got that pole on my heel got the business in my pocket
I'ma flex where I want to flex and you ain't gon stop it
Walking feeling like a millionaire bitch cuz I am
I can fall out with a nigga buy the bitch cuz I sham

[Chorus]
I'm designed to live my best life
I'm designed to live my best life
I'm designed to live my best life
I'm designed to live my best life
I'm designed to live my best life
