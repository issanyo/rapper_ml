Can Miss Becky please raise her hand, bruh
I need some of that good head right now, bruh
I need that Becky

[Hook]
I'm on this liquor oh so heavy
'Fo we fuck, can you neck me?
A lil' head and I am ready
I want yo mouth, give me that Becky

[Verse 1]
Keep that pussy I want yo throat
Front that head 'fo you go
Wet yo mouth 'fo you blow
Must get Becky 'fo I bow

You Miss Becky? Let me know
Licky, licky, I love that, bro
Head nigga thatz 'fosho
I'mma lock yo jaws 'fo I go

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Like pussy love head
Will pay, I got that bread
Open yo mouth 'fo you open yo legs
Man down, I am dead

Suck no dick? Can't get in my bed
Heard me right, thatz what I said
Drop that spit right on that head
Squeeze that meat and hit that head

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Tired of pussy, I'm retired
Ain't fuckin' her, got too many mouths
Will put poll right in her mouth
Babbit pussy ain't my style

Fine head make me smile
Put that mayonnaise on your child
Gotta be grown to fuck with Plies
The longer you suck, the longer I whyle

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4]
Just got Becky, I can't move
I love Becky, yes I do
I get Becky, I am glued
Give me Becky, I'll do you

You don't do Becky, bye bye, boo
I love Becky like my jewels
You don't like Becky, you a fool
Oughta put Becky on the new

Becky, Becky, she so cool
I don't get Becky I can't sleep
I need Becky 'fo I beat
Becky, Becky, marry me

[Hook x2]

Gimme that Becky, gimme that Becky (Repeat x4)
