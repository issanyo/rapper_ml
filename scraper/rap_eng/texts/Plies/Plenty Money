What's in my pocket dog? Big face hundreds
Just left the mall, bought everythang that I wanted
I kinda mad with you haters, I'm real disappointed
Cause what you didn't tell the people, is I got plenty money
I got plenty money, I got plenty money
I got plenty money, I got plenty money
I got plenty money, I got plenty money
I got plenty money, I got plenty money


[Verse 1]
I like my bitches hood, but all my whips foreign
Just bought another house, the last one was borin
Ten-thousand square-feet, it feel like you tourin
You niggas dissin me, it really ain't important
Take off yo' shirt nigga, I bet yo' ribs showin
You niggas starvin, my money overflowin
Jewelry game sick; got all these hoes adorin'
Catch me in the club with all the 'gnac pourin'
If I ever go to prison, I'mma have plenty stories
Sleep real good, cause I ain't got no worries
Stay fresh everyday, jewelry stay glowin
I got plenty money and all you niggas knowin

[Verse 2]
Next month, guess what? I'm buyin rappers
I'm startin to feel sorry for you lil' bastards
I'm pretty hot, yo' career a disaster
I control you niggas, somethin like yo master
65 grand, that's 'round the bezel
Stay from 'round me if you don't like to smell cheddar
I ain't fuckin with that ho cause she a dick hiker
Wanna know who I'm fuckin, my money, I just married her
She been good to me, I might five karat her
Ran me out the sto', I bought too many plasmas
Count so much money, breathe like I got asthma
The old sayin is "The mo' money, the merrier"

[Verse 3]
I don't know why I bought the Bentley when I had the Maserati
What I paid for the "Goon" chain, 140
Scared to keep money on me cause I will blow it
My strip club name is "Mr. Will-Throw-It"
Keep fire on deck and I will show it
Fuck with me and get whacked and all you niggas know it
Scared to dance in the club cause my fire loaded
If you won't use it guess what? Then don't tote it
Mo' money to most niggas mean mo' hoeish
Mo' money to me it mean keep goin
Haters gettin tired, my money still growin
Ball all night, catch a flight in the mo'nin
