Came through stunting with a money bag

Keep them sucker niggas in my rear view
Stay loud, hater, I can’t hear you
Bought a new crib with the hill view
Squad god more green than the field do
Holla out, salute to my real troops
Head busting when we come through and peel roof
Got my bitch a new weave, it’s a deal booth
Throwing big green at a steel coupe
Shined up, never need to touch it
And we ain’t filling y’all, like an empty bucket
You fish just text like an empty socket
And I just dropped a fifth so I’m extra nutty
So I burp on my way, no one, no day
The west is behind me like my name Kanye
Fly everyday, no gotty pass
And I came through stunting with a money bag

[Chorus:]
Came through stunting with a money bag

Picture me? No, sir! With a Mac, 90 wrap, with a D, sir
Stay course side, with a bitch war
Got bomb money on me if they do call
Fuck, niggaare, you don't know me!
When you roll like that, you try to rob me?
If you with me and you don't shoot
Then be man enough not to fucking ask soon
I made a call to a bitch that got a boyfriend
A finger in her pussy, talking to her boyfriend
Got a Porsche in my pocket, all C-Notes
Got a face in my lap, all dick up
Still fuck a bitch in my by-C
Giddyup, on the floor, right beside me
Said a dick in er chest, I told her my bad!
One of you gon'leave with a shit bag

[Chorus:]
I roll with my brother when he with me
Put a whole fifth, now the niggaare dead
Got a stack eye paired, got a best sale
I ain't coming out your mouth 'till your boat here
You ain't fucking with me, niggaare, you got little money
I ain't fucking with you neither, being told on me
I am grand on this end, ain't shit a hundred
Put a dope I don't wanna see the troll coming
All you niggers being broke, better tighten up
All you hoes ain't fucking, better bite up
Look how she looking at me, wanna eat a niggaare
Them niggers gotta bitch, we the niggers!
Better snap out, or you get left, foul!
Can't get your bitch pregnant, she on death row
