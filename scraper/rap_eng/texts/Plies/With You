(intro)
This is not the yak talkin , this is plies talkin right now!

(Chorus)
Baby I fucks with you, cause all them little thangs you do
You keep it so true, that's why I fucks with you
Cause you ain't worry about the fame, or the name or the bling
Thats why I'm calling you a bad, motherfucker, can't nan another bitch out there touch ya
Ladies start dancing when I walk in usher & I ain't scared to say it neither
...I fucks with you

(Verse 1)

I ran down on her, she was dat so I cuffed
Cute little baby plus she got a good butt
I'm fucked up about like, for real doe bruh
Hygene A1 so I don't smell nothing
She Bout that life thats why I deal with her
When she ask me to come through ion even buck
She can be sleeping, I call her, she pop right up
And nobody rock them boy shorts like her
Them Lil Cheeks be hanging I'll be looking at her stuck
She ain't got to ask for bread cause I fuck with a tough
Her homegirl I call her she come through in the clutch
I fuck with her the long way though like straight up

Baby I fucks with you, cause all them little thangs you do
You keep it so true, that's why I fucks with you
Cause you ain't worry about the fame, or the name or the bling
Thats why I'm calling you a bad, motherfucker, can't nan another bitch out there touch ya
Ladies start dancing when I walk in usher & I ain't scared to say it neither
...I fucks with you

(Verse 2)
If I was broke right now I think she let me hold something
I feel like she for me, so I include her in the stuntin
Mama bills get behind I shoot her a lil somethin answer my phone in front of her she don't say nothing
I get to talking to long thou she look at me funny
She know it ain't nothing, the boy just gettin to the money
When I Wanna Tease her a lil bit I just call her country when I wanna see her smile thou I just tell her she buggin chill when she need to snap when she have to
One thang about it, she do her thang with them hair do's
I told her she been gettin thick since I been cuttin her she told me, no I ain't I get it from my mama

Baby I fucks with you, cause all them little thangs you do
You keep it so true, that's why I fucks with you
Cause you ain't worry about the fame, or the name or the bling
Thats why I'm calling you a bad, motherfucker, can't nan another bitch out there touch ya
Ladies start dancing when I walk in usher & I ain't scared to say it neither
...I fucks with you

(verse 3)
I'm still grinding, she deserves a nigga like me
She fall I got her Ima put her back on her feet
I ain't trying to change her, she trying to change me
She just got real, she ask if I want a key
I wanted to tell her yeah but I had to keep it g
That's why I fucks with you, cause you fucks with me
I can be on the road, and she can be out of town
And ain't got to sweat her, cause she gonna hold me down
Whether she do or don't she act like she care
Even when I ain't around, she act like I'm there
I ain't one of them dudes who tell you what to wear
You can flaunt it all you want to, I ain't insecure

Baby I fucks with you, cause all them little thangs you do
You keep it so true, that's why I fucks with you
Cause you ain't worry about the fame, or the name or the bling
Thats why I'm calling you a bad, motherfucker, can't nan another bitch out there touch ya
Ladies start dancing when I walk in usher & I ain't scared to say it neither
...I fucks with you
