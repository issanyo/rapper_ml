'Fore I take it in, I got to catch me one more sell
Name saved up under Febreze, 'cause she ain't got no smell
I can hit it from the back, ain't got to hold my breath
All these hundreds on me got me starting to look like a scammer
All that ass she got back there starting to look like a Pamper
Pull up on ya ass with a bag just like I'm Santa
Plug name Julio but he don't play for Atlanta
The only millionare you know that wear Dope Boy Ree's

But you gotta pray for me 'cause these niggas be hating in my city
And you gotta thank God everyday he be letting you be with me

Your last man bought you Bebe but I'll buy you Givenchy
Biggest thing he ever did for you was take you to Chili's
Keep a bank in my pocket, call me Plies Fargo
Sex game undefeated, think I'm 100-0
I don't go nowhere for free, if you got a check I'll go
Your last man, he was petty, tell him I said so
I be hustling so hard I lose track of the days
That li'l pussy was so sorry, I call it minimum wage
'Fore you leave this earth baby you better get you a hitta
Talking one that got a bag and drop that rod like a killa
Yea, I just wanna know
Have you ever made love to a real hitta
