Bruh bruh, I am feeling myself today bruh
Let me tell y'all how I really feel bruh

[Hook: x2]
I'm on my New York shit
I think I'm hot son
White girls staring at me lookin' like she lost somethin'
I don't know what her problem is I hope she fuckin' say somethin'
Asked her what the problem
She said you're fuckin' awesome

[Verse 1:]
Just brought a drop top
Feel like I'm in LA
Everybody watching me
Feel like I'm da movie
Homie got his first block
Took it from an Ol yay
Judge asked me who da shooter
Told him no comprende
Few dudes kinda whack
Certain names can't say
Streets won't hire him
Him have no resume
I am not industry
Certain games don't play
Met her at da cheese cake
Ran through her same day
We know he sweet
We call him Kool-Aid
I buy Maybach
I don't buy dolces
Half a mili to da side
Savin' it for da court case
I am fuckin' awesome dat's what da streets say

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2:]
I am fish grease
What dat mean?
I'm really hot
No M's, no places
What dat mean?
He really not
Tight jeans, tight shirts
What dat mean?
He really pop
Ten stacks each pocket
What dat mean?
Real gwop
3 Becky's one me
What dat mean?
A lot of top
AR a hundred rounds
What dat mean?
A lot of shots
No cred, no stripes
What dat mean?
A lot of talk
A M worth of jewels on
Still won't cool off
I feel bad for him
Him he fall off
She said we did it twice
I don't remember her
My son told his teacher
I got a rich pa
I asked him why he said dat
He said I didn't lie pa

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Tell da truth don't lie
Who da fuckin' man now?
When I shoot I don't miss
So dat mean no rebound
She said when you beat her
She makes no sound
She get on my nerves
I make her bite a towel
If you got a buzz
Means you ain't sold shit clown
He didn't wanna pay me
So I told him to move rounds
If you don't wanna talk numbers
Catch me when I cool down
I am fuckin' awesome
I like how dat sound

[Hook]
