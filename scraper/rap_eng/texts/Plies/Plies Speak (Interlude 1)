Yeah, yeah
I've been hearing the streets talking, yeah
Man, y'all fuck niggas wasting your time, dog
You'll never catch me slipping, nigga
Nigga, I'd grab my 5 'fore I grab my car keys, nigga
Nigga, I'd grab my 5 'fore I grab my license, nigga
Nigga, I'd grab my 5 'fore I put money in my pocket, nigga
My head stay on a swivel
So it might look like I ain't paying no attention to you
When you talking to me, dog
But I refuse to let a bitch get the opps on me, nigga
I'd rather kill me an innocent bitch, my nigga
'Fore I let a nigga slide on me, nigga
