You the type that trynna to get a buzz

And please don't play with me if you ain't "Trump Tight"

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
My nigga put a potato on a barrel
And tied a bag around the fire to catch the shells
Ima nolia boy but my face gator around the deal
I was scam no gram, I can't be waiting to make a sale
I want all the beef, my zombies they be starving over here
My nigga [?] baked chicken keep that silverware
My niggas in the kitchen water whipping, I swear them boys a chef
I back there gripping on that glizzy, now I go out by myself
My nigga itching wishing well, bitch we jigging on the gram
Right now I'm rolling out my potato bitch, stick it on the M
You won't catch me saying nan, now I don't play on Instagram
Boy was about to mash your whole potato
So everything gravy huh
