[Intro: Plies]
Heh...
You know they say I'll never sleep, right?
(They say I'll never sleep!)
This one it got number one written all over it
(This here is number one bay-bay)
So let me go and play with it again real quick
(May I please play with it again?)
It's been labelled as being called Plies at his finest
(This is Plies at his finest)
But I'm fin' to fall back right back cause uh
(Fin' to fall back) I would never do this part right here
Ha hah

[Hook: Chris J]
Shorty I wanna know if you come over
If you don't mind girl put your legs up on my shoulders (ooh-wee!)
Don't lie, I can see it in your eyes
You want for you and I to do the freaky things you like
When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya
When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya
When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya
When I put-put-put it on ya, put-put-put it on ya

[Plies]
Let's ride 'round the city, make love in the car
Let's get on the express way and let me tease you ma
And while you drive baby, I wanna taste your tongue
Pull in the rest area and let me give you some
You ever been drivin while your man made you cum
I wanna hit a stay, I wanna hit and run
Let's pull the car over, and have a little fun
The AC workin, so we ain't gotta bun

[Bridge: Chris J]
Can I lick it, can I stick it, can I touch it, can I grab it
Baby tell me can I have it (ooh-wee!)
Can I rub it, can I flip it, can I hold it, can I get it
Anyway I wanna get it~!

[Hook]

[Plies]
If that don't work for ya I got another idea
Ain't nobody home, so go on come over here
Let's play hide and seek, in our underwear
I find you, I can get it right there
You find me, then I get bare
Either way we both win, now that's fair
Whatever I gotta do to be wit'cha, oh yeah
You my queen, I'm your king, now that's a nice pair

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Plies]
Let me grade you, give you a repo't card
Your first test is, can you get it hard
Show me how good you communicate when we start
Today's pop quiz, define yo' hot spot
Wanna see how good yo' balance is on top
Give you a A+, if you don't stop
This a big test, you lookin kinda shocked
Either you get promoted, or you get dropped
Your final exam, show me yo' wet box
Ain't no tattle teller, I keep my mouth locked
Make you an honor student, show me your back shot
You passed with flyin colors, ooh that's a nice twat

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Outro]
Ooh-wee!
