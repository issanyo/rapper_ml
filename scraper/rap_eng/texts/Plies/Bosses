[Verse 1: Plies]
You kinda remind me of a female me
You keep the bag and you deal like me
I'm counting money it's a party yeah
Butter dripping from the lobster tail
Stick on me like a hockey player
Pull a 50 piece like a be on mail
Before I rap I wanna see credential
Before I cuff I wanna see potential
Might kinda remind me of a perfect team
Pussy going like a fur coat why am
Bold dust yeah we dripping sauce
Bold dust we are almost
I stand by us like a lion king
She dancing here like a designer queen
I might pull out my debt on you
All hundreds gonna flipping on you
I ain't fucking no more basic bitches
If you ain't bossed up then you can't get it
If you ain't a boss too then I ain't with it
Cause fucking a boss it's a real privilege
I ain't fucking no more basic bitches
If you ain't boss stuff then you can't get it
If you ain't a boss too then I ain't with it
Cause fucking a boss it's a real privilege

[Chorus]
Me plus you put out together baby girl you got bosses (bosses)
Me plus you put out together baby girl you got bosses (bosses)
Me plus you put out together baby girl you got bosses (bosses)
Me plus you put out together baby girl you got bosses (bosses)
Bosses
Bosses
Bosses
Bosses
Me plus you put out together baby girl you got bosses (bosses)
Me plus you put out together baby girl you got bosses (bosses)

[Verse 2: Kash Doll]
Bosses so many ways we worry about the losses
We ain't worry about the cost
Killers seen buying coffins
Book a flight live loss
I wake up in the morning on some rich bitch shit
I gotta rich bitch wrist
And I never been on a rich nigga dick
Unless I'm on a rich nigga dick
Even then I gotta stick to the script
Me plus you together we make bosses
In a cool zoom and diamonds doing the sauces
That's saucy that's bossy I got Starbuck skin look like coffee
Workers be so exhausted
Worker bags in the closet
Karmas on deposit
And my body's still a topic
I've been giving y'all the larger act
Cause that's what a boss do
Every time I dribble that's a boss move
Every time we kick it we get to the goals
Throw it to the sin to cover the flaws
Paying homage curd to some of you hoes
Tell 'em kill 'em something like eureka

[Chorus: Plies]
Me plus you put us together baby girl you got bosses (bosses)
Me plus you put us together baby girl you got bosses (bosses)
Me plus you put us together baby girl you got bosses (bosses)
Me plus you put us together baby girl you got bosses (bosses)
Bosses
Bosses
Bosses
Bosses
Me plus you put us together baby girl you got bosses (bosses)
Me plus you put us together baby girl you got bosses (bosses)

[Verse 3: Plies]
When I have fun I waking everybody up
Same nigga snitching in high school tattle tail
I hear latitude like I'm in air
Buying Alexander fuck yeah Chanel
On water roll I want stocks of bun
Taking turns on cake all leave twice of mine
Yeah you mum tender put her on the couch
She need to borrow money then she can take it out
Had a bunch of friends over so they can see the view
You're like the stock market I wanna invest in you
You tried sister clone I don't wanna stress you
They gotta talk to them before they get to you
Oh thanks mom I gotta boss mind
I got a rich meal and expensive time
Don't wanna pussy first I wanna sex your mind
And your panties are wet at the same time
Every time I talk I speak boss language
20 grand mo that's a boss payment
You gonna pop out and eat the biscuits
Still eat the odds leave it with the fish
Everything I do I like to live it a lot
With your money I like to tear it up
I'm B-O-S-S baby you a boss don't over rest baby
