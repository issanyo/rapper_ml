[Verse 1]
It's that heroin flow, might get an item for this
Still keep a scope on a stick, just to make sure I don't miss
I'm on the low of the scales, I like the fork on me feel
Knee bitch in all I don't kneel
That said achieving will kill 'em
Ain't been asleep in a week
Money be having me deep
I ain't even reach my peak
White when you call for free
I keep a stick in my pants, already smoke too much
I don't really hang around niggas, ya'll like to bitch too much
Using more dope on the regular, although why don't we tell 'em?
I already fought with one of 'em
Y'all better check my credentials
Bitch I'm from Pakistan, meaning I ain't wrapped too tight
I used to sleep through the day, I used to hustle at night
I walk with pride, it's real, I got my .9 on me
I am the G.O.A.T for real, you can't deny my homie
I'd rather grind and ball, don't need relying at all
If I gotta question you, then you ain't my dog at all
I wake up flex, God done already blessed me
I won't let a male or a female stress me
I don't need no more kills, I'm not trying to erase ya'
I ain't trying to marry, I'm just trying to hit ya'
Drawn piece of 'erb me, no you can't search me
You ain't never worked me, I can't let you murk me
Diamonds on the top dance, strippers on my lap dance
Just like I signed myself, gave myself my own advance
Realer than yo' favorite rapper
I got mo' money than yo' favorite Trump
Late nigga that's how I move, she let me fault one over
Getting money by true profession. no bitch I ain't never stressing
Started feeling like Machiavelli, damn that ain't gonna be necessary

[Chorus]
It's that heroin flow
Might get an item for this
Might get an item for this
Might get an item for this
It's that heroin flow
Might get an item for this
Might get an item for this
Might get an item for this

[Verse 2]
Still walk 'round with dotty, then brought my bitch come thottie
When I was legit though, while fucking and bitchin' they got it
Still got Trump in my blood, my folk went and bought me a bud
Still bad bitches I hate, dumb bitches get on my nerves
Listen to wave and boos, get on that dope and I swerve
I ain't never been cured, you know how my dough body's served?
Got bodies under my belt, notes across my face
Man school that nigga, remember no face, no case

[Chorus]
It's that heroin flow
Might get an item for this
Might get an item for this
Might get an item for this
It's that heroin flow
Might get an item for this
Might get an item for this
Might get an item for this
