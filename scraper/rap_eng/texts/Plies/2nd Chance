I went to see my nigga, he doin seventeen
One of the realest niggas, I done ever seen
Got caught with a bird, but his record was clean
Comin back from Dade, on the Gator with speed
He a real soldier, but his partner was green
Get out when he 40, went in at 23
How seventeen years worth one key(kilo)
Some shit cost twenty grand can get you over ten piece
He ain't wanna hurt nobody, he was just tryin to eat
He had a real job, went to work fo' days a week
Said this his last trip, and he was gettin out the streets
He a good nigga, second chance all he need

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Some niggas make mistakes, off fucked up circumstance
Now they life gone, probably gon' die in the pen
They done gave up on life, done put it in God's hands
I thought this was America, what happened to a second chance?

[Plies]
Wish I had one chance, to sentence the Judge kids
And watch 'em beg fo' they life like my niggas did
Give them a life sentence, fo' some shit that wasn't big
'Fore they get granted they appeal they gotta do ten
Shoe got to be on the other foot for you to understand
The scariest shit in the world to be a black man
What my future holds, wish I knew in advance
I 'proach life everyday just hopin I win
A lot us already lost, we sittin in the pen
This shit crazy cause God, he forgive sin
But when it come to the system that shit don't bend
I guess it do, dependin on the color of yo' skin

[Hook]

[Plies]
I thought it was understood, nobody was perfect
So how can one mistake, make yo' life worthless?
God made us all, put us here to serve a purpose
Yo' life in twelve strangers hands to come back with a verdict
But is that really fair? What if they all was dirty?
You mess up one time, and they come back with thirty
But if you ain't got money, yo' whole family hurtin
Then you ain't got a choice, you gotta cop out early
But if you was rich, you wouldn'ta got them thirty
What if the Judge racist? Nobody to overturn it
This system fucked up, because it ain't sturdy
Welcome to America, home of the controversy
