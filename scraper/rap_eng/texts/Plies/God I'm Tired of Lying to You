[Intro]
God, man, there's just something I wanna talk to you about man, I...
I know right now, I'm probably
Probably the last nigga you wanna hear from
You know, man, I just want you to know, God, man
I'm tired of lying to you

[Chorus]
God, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you
And I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you
So if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand
But I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then
God, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you
And I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you
So if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand
But I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then

[Verse 1]
I told a motherfucker if I died today, I don't know where I'd go
'Cause a lot of us out here that think we going to Heaven and just ain't gon' go
And some of us go to church every Sunday and still ain't gon' go
God, I lied to you too much, that's the reason I don't know where I'm gon' go
I remember that little hoe [?], man, I told you I wasn't gon' fuck raw no more
I guess what I should've said is I wasn't gonna fuck her raw no more
And after my homeboy got killed, I promised you I was gonna start coming to church
But instead of coming to church, I jumped in the game, head first
It seems like weddings and funerals are the only time I step foot in church
But if I was locked up right now, shit, you would be my best friend
'Cause that's when niggas seem like the Lord's pointing they lives then
My dog locked up and every time i talk to him, God all I'm hearing
But like I told him, the crackers let him out tomorrow, he'd be back robbing again
And I don't know why we sit down and lie to you 'bout some fuck shit
And like they say, the ones that love you want a nigga to give they ass a kiss
So I guess that's the best way to explain me and your relationship

[Chorus]
God, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you
And I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you
So if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand
But I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then
God, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you
And I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you
So if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand
But I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then

[Verse 2]
I told my mama, shit, God must be a pain freak
'Cause after all these lies and broken promises, God still fuck with me
I'ma be honest with you, God: shit, I wouldn't even fuck with me
But when I was on my dick, shit, you couldn't stop hearing from me
As soon as my money got straight, shit, you stopped hearing from me
And after my brother got indicted, I promised you I was through with the dope game
And as soon as them 22's came out, I got right back in the dope game
I remember being on my knees, throwing up my insides
The heavy yak in my system, felt like I was 'bout to fucking die
And I told you I wasn't gonna drink no more, shit, there goes another lie
And I know one day, all this thugging shit gotta come to an end
And I understand that one day, my life got to come to an end

[Chorus]
God, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you
And I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you
So if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand
But I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then
God, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you
And I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you
So if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand
But I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then

[Monologue]
God, man, there's just...
There's so much fucked up with me right now, man, just...
Trying to be out here and, you know
Trying to get money and...
Fuck with all these hoes and...
You know, I, I find time for everything else
But it seem like I don't never got no time for you
And shit, my grandma always tell me, man
I-I just need to just join somebody's church, man
And, and give my life over to God, man
And God, you just know, man
Just right now, man, you better know than anybody, man
You just, you just know I'm full of shit
You know I ain't finna do right right now
You know, I don't know if this gonna affect, you know what I'm saying
Me, me getting into Heaven
But you know, I just want you to know, man
I'm, I'm just tired of lying to you, man
And I feel like if I'ma deal with you
I feel like I should deal with you like a real nigga
And I don't know why
You know, I've seen the, I've seen to lose focus in that, man
And, you know, shit, I know you probably feel like I'm, I'm bullshitting you right now
But you know, God, man, I, I, I just want you know, man
I'm tired of lying to you, man
And I just feel like if I'm gonna fuck with you
I need to fuck with you all the way
And, man, regardless of what, you know, a lot of people think, man
Man, I, I'm trying to go to Heaven, man
You got to know I got a good heart, man
God, I just want you to know, man, I'm tired of lying to you

[Chorus]
God, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you
And I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you
So if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand
But I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then
God, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you
And I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you
So if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand
But I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then
