[Intro]
It's amazing to me homie (it's amazing to me homie)
The niggas you fuck wit dog (the niggas you fuck wit everyday)
You don't know the truth about these niggas until y'all fall out ('til y'all fall out)
The mo' you show a nigga, the mo' dangerous he become to ya homie

[Hook] X2
I broke bread with you, nigga, showed you where I live
You talk it, nigga, but you don't understand what real is
When it came to you pussy ass nigga I woulda killed
But it was my fault, nigga, I kept it too real

[Verse 1]
We bust choppas at niggas, laid in bushes together
You had me fooled, dog, I thought you was my fuckin' nigga
Woulda did a hundred years for ya, cause I fucked wit ya
You taught me what a good heart in these streets will get a nigga
Not a muthafuckin thang but a sad picture
Hurt me when I found out you had pussy in yo heart, nigga
I never thought I'd say it but muthafuck a friend
Cause your dog be the one that cross you in the end
The shit I know now wish I'd knew it back then
But goin through it with a fuck nigga is what make a man
I treat yo pussy ass better than I did my own kin
When a nigga locked up or broke that's when they claim love you then

[Hook] X2

[Verse 2]
What was mine was yours, but what yours wasn't mine
If a nigga woulda told me you was flaw I woulda thought he was lyin'
But every nigga gone show his hand in due time
I kept it so muthafuckin real with you that I was blind
Cause I was too busy showin love I ain't see the signs
When you needed me pussy, I came thru everytime
Whether you was right or wrong, fuck nigga, I was ridin'
But you envied me nigga in the back of yo' mind
You wasn't a hundred, nigga, you was real part-time
I broke you off when them fuck niggas wouldn't give you a dime
I ain't owe you shit, nigga, I just wanted to see you shine
You never gave me shit, nigga, I had my own grind
And ain't need yo' choppas, I had my own nine
I'm a hundred, nigga, I done did me and yo' time
You can't trust your own homies, who the fuck can you trust
I got more pride in my choppas so to me that's enough

[Hook] X2

[Verse 3]
And God ain't makin' you fuck niggas like he used to
A nigga believe his ho now fo' he believe you
And cause you thug wit a nigga don't mean the love true
It used to matter what you and yo' niggas done been thru
A nigga can be yo' dog one day and turn pussy out the blue
A fuck nigga gone do what a fuck nigga gone do
Better off runnin' by yo'self if you only knew
Don't mean that nigga a hundred cause he'll fuckin shoot
And money don't mean he real cause he got loot
If a nigga heart ain't right no tellin what he'll do
And real niggas extinct, it's only a fuckin few
Cause ninety-nine percent of these fuck niggas ain't true

[Hook]

A my nigga, I wanna thank all the pussy ass niggas who I thought was real, my nigga
Nigga's who I thought was my muthafuckin homeboy's, nigga
I salute you, pussy ass niggas, homie
Cause if it wasn't for you fuck niggas my nigga
I still be showin' love right now, dog
I still be walkin' thru this muthafucka blind, my nigga
But it's something that y'all niggas taught me, my nigga
That it's your homies, my nigga
That try you the muthafuckin most, my nigga
Them the niggas that you let them hold something dog
And they feel like they ain't got never give it back cause they yo' muthafuckin' dog
Them the niggas who could be tied down and locked up, my nigga
And you can take care of them niggas for two, three years, my nigga
And soon as them niggas get out, dog
They go fuck with the niggas who ain't never gave 'em nothing, my nigga
Go run back to the same ho, won't ain't never did nothing for them while they was locked up, homie
I thank you niggas, I salute you niggas, my nigga
And with all that said, my nigga, I wanna tell you one thing before I go, homie
God bless you, pussy ass niggas
