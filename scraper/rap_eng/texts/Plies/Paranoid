[Hook: Plies]

[Verse 1: Plies]

Motherfuck the world
Cause the world is evil
Just bought me a new forty
I call that bitch the sequel
Why I don't go to church?
Cause I can’t trust the preacher
I don't fuck hoes at my house
Cause I can't trust ‘em neither
I see a car with tint on it
I think it’s them people
Cause keeping shit one hun’na
That shit must be illegal
The feds done picked up twenty niggas
And now they got me peeping
I heard them niggas rob
That’s why I keep on reaching
And why I'm riding dolo?
Cause motherfuckers sneaky
I don't talk around niggas
Cause that’s how shit be leaking
I keep buying them toolies
I got my fucking reasons
And why I ain't super friendly?
Cause bitch, I ain't no deacon


[Hook: Plies]

[Verse 2: Plies]

A nigga called my phone
I feel he talking crazy
He talking about his plug
And how he can whip a baby
I hung up on that nigga’s ass
Cause bitch, this ain't the Eighties
I’ve been out here too long
And that ain't how you play me
A bitch that stop my car
She talking about she pregnant
Bitch you trying to come up
I don't understand that language
Cause me and you ain't never fucked
Ain't never got you naked
You sucked my dick and jacked me off
And after that I fainted
Bitch you picked the wrong one
Cause I can’t make you famous
I can’t trust these hoes
Cause I don't know what they thinking
Police lurking hard
Got me scared to drive
Hope they ain’t tryin' to pull me
I'm paranoid and high


[Hook: Plies]

I'm para-, para-, para-, paranoid
I'm para-, para-, para-, paranoid
These hoes got me paranoid
These niggas got me paranoid
The police and the motherfucking Feds got me paranoid
That’s why I'm para-, para-, para-, paranoid
That’s why I'm para-, para-, para-, paranoid
These hoes got me paranoid
These niggas got me paranoid
The police and the motherfucking Feds got me paranoid


[Verse 3: Plies]

Who to fucking trust?
Cause friends done got shady
Cause one of my lil’ homies
Fucking my other dawg’s lady
And I ain't gonna tell him shit
Cause he gonna think I'm hating
My cousin robbed his big brother
Put his big brother on three-eighty
The streets done got slow
So everybody taking
And most of them niggas in the county
Got everybody shaking
Them niggas dropping names
Depending what they facing
It’s four o'clock in the morning
I'm in the crib pacing
Ain’t nobody out here safe
Cause shit out here ain't gravy
Cause dawgs been crossing dawgs
That’s how shit been going lately
Everybody got a mask
Bitch out here like Jason
I can be in the bed
I got that bitch off safety


[Hook: Plies]

I'm para-, para-, para-, paranoid
I'm para-, para-, para-, paranoid
These hoes got me paranoid
These niggas got me paranoid
The police and the motherfucking Feds got me paranoid
That’s why I'm para-, para-, para-, paranoid
That’s why I'm para-, para-, para-, paranoid
These hoes got me paranoid
These niggas got me paranoid
The police and the motherfucking Feds got me paranoid
