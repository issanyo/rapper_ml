Yuck is what I'm sipping

Deep down and got me tripping

Smoking in the building please get out your feelings
Guess into a letter eat me she gone be really

Told that thing wasn't smelling right
I told her what's the sour

Bitch I got a driver
Please don't come around I swear to God I ain't lying
I'm real just like the Bible

You ain't gotta choose no mo'
Look bitch you expired
You cold in these streets right now I'm on fire
Soon as I walk in this bitch I went viral

[Chorus]
Bitch like that went viral
Whole squad like that went viral
Look at how I'm slaying when are windup went viral
Bitch like that went viral
Whole squad like that went viral
Look at how they staying talking 'bout when I went viral
