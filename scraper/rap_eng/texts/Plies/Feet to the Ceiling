[Hook]
I got her feet to the ceiling, yeah (x8)

[Verse 1]
I'm standin' up in her
I'm droppin' nothin' but dick in her
Got me on that XO tonight so I'm a long dick her
Hard like a roll of quarters
I got that log in her
Legs in the air and I'm hittin' that pussy the dead center
Back of her thighs
I got em up on my shoulders
Nut, I feel it comin' but naw, I think I'mma hold it
Lookin' at her square in the face her eyes rollin'
She yelling like a nigga
It's killin' her but she soakin'
Hittin' deep down in that pussy I got it talkin'
Pussy go to bitin' so hard I tell her pause it
I ain't tryna disrespect it just let me dog it
Naw naw naw don't push me up out it shawty
I'm a couple strokes in, I think I'm catchin' my rhythm
She know the cat good, I can tell by how I'm hittin' her
I'm a performer muthafucka I love being in the mirror
Got her pinned down to the bed but I got her feet to the ceiling

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got her pinned up good and I ain't gone let her move
Standin' up on my toes I'm paintin' her ass too
She sweatin' like a bitch even though we in a dew
I'm laughin' like a bitch cause I ain't even much through
I told her don't move now, just keep em up in the air
Dick so good she think I'm fucker her bare
I ain't trippin' though if the pussy got a lil' hair
The main thing though, it got no wear and tear
Legs in the air, I call that in the buck
Press on her legs, I'm tearin' her ass up
She call a nigga name out, that's what cranks me up
Now she talkin' with her eyes closed yelling out what?
("Paint me") yeah, I got her yelling out
("Paint me") yeah, I got her yelling out
("Paint me") yeah, I got her yelling out
("Paint me") yeah, I got her feet to the ceiling

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got her spread on nice she hangin' off the bed
Now I really finna paint her, she holdin' her own legs
Got the pillows stacked up so she don't hit her head
Just teasin' her right now, just fuckin' her with the head
I can hear how it smackin' how I done got her wet
Well I can't even lie she got some good sex
I can tell how she runnin', I'm damn there in her chest
Got her legs pushed back they damn near by her neck
Stop yelling for a minute and tell me I'm the best
Let you breath for a minute, but I ain't gone let you rest
Maybe one or two more of them nuts I'm a let you catch
After that shit happens, then mine I gotta catch
I done switched up on it now it's all finesse
Got her eyes real big cause she don't know what's next
I can do this all day and I don't need no rest
Just gimme hip motion, But keep ya feet to the ceiling
