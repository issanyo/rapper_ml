[Hook x2]
Strap on my muhfuckin' lap, it shoot a hunna
Bad bitches all on dimes, gotta hunna
Stickin it on that ass, doing the dance, doing the hunna
I ain’t got no change yeah, all I got is hunna

[Verse 1]
New pair of Lees, white tees, fuck Louie
Stop talking 'bout it, be about it, pussy do it
S'posed to go to court, said fuck it, I ain’t going
New 11's came out I'm goin' to get the Jordans
He rap his ass off but that fuck nigga corny
He asked me for a verse, told him fuck it
I ain’t doing it
Money in the ceiling, got them turkeys in the van
Pistol on the counter, got the cookies 'front the fan

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hood ass nigga in a 5 star suite
Nickel plated choppa, nigga that 5 star heat
I don’t give a fuck, drop the hunna on the piece
Paid for it cash, told them crackers I don't lease
If one of us gon' die, pussy nigga it wasn’t beef
You scared, say you scared
Nigga get behind me
Pills on my lap, waste them all on the seat
Pour down the liquor, for my homie, rest in peace

[Hook]
