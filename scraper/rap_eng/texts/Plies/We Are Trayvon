I never thought that wearing no hoodie, could cause your life
And I never thought you could kill somebody and go out on the same night
Everyone gone see that boy, don't mean that he bite
And everything that's black even as pure is white
Cause you think I'm doin wrong don't mean that you right
Cause the ones that you think, may be the ones who might
Some people in this world the system don't like
What you living is what you work is how they value your life
I can do all things to christ, whos strength is me
And even when I pray I praise my enemy
And pa said it best "only God can judge"
Trayvon lil homie, I want you to know you really touched me
You will forever live on, forever live on
You will forever live on, forever live on
You will forever live on, forever live on
You will forever live on, forever live on
You will forever live on, forever live on
Sometimes trying to live right
Sometimes it seems so wrong, sometimes you tryin to get just
Sometimes it take so long
But the ones that trying to keep peace
Are the ones that let go home
But the ones that hustle and survive
Are the ones that are home with no bome
My son supposed the burrie me
But I ain't supposed to burrie my son
You can call me nigga all you want
But he gone treat me like one
But I dare to express my self
Be any dresser I want
Please let me go where I please
But they don't beleive when I don't
But they think that you sell dope, just cause you drive a benz
They think you in a game, just cause he sag his pants
What's right is right, what's wrong is wrong, trayvon martin
You will forever live on
You will forever live on, forever live on
You will forever live on, forever live on
You will forever live on, forever live on
You will forever live on, forever live on
You will forever live on, forever live on
