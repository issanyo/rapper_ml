[Chorus]
I got drip for sale (Drip), I got drip for sale (Damn)
I got drip for sale (Drip), I got drip for sale (Damn)
I got drip for sale (Drip), I got drip for sale (Drip)
I got drip for sale (Drip), I got drip for sale (Damn)
I got drip for sale (Drip), I got drip for sale (Drip)
I got drip for sale (Drip), I got drip for sale (Damn)

[Verse 1]
Had a blue eighty, coulda bought me a Rolex
Always bitchin', shoulda bought him a Kotex
Dependin' how I feel, might throw me two back
Glee glee, yeah, like Kodak
Your lil' bitch tryna ride my wave
NBA YoungBoy outside today
Shoe game sick, finna see my doctor
Niggas stealin' swag, finna call my lawyer
Flew three hoes into Miami at the same damn time
Had 'em suckin', had 'em fuckin' at the same damn time
I bought 'em Fendi, bought 'em Louis at the same damn time
Spun it back, made a bag at the same damn time

[Chorus]
I got drip for sale (Drip), I got drip for sale (Damn)
I got drip for sale (Drip), I got drip for sale (Damn)
I got drip for sale (Drip), I got drip for sale (Drip)
I got drip for sale (Drip), I got drip for sale (Damn)

[Verse 2]
Big boy drip, can't find this at Macy's
Four pockets thick and I had all of 'em crazy
Twenty strippers 'round me, got all of 'em naked
Got twenty niggas 'round you and all of 'em fake
Had a Lear from L.A., droppin' all drip
Ten grand, all hunnids, call that a clip
In some Alexander McQueen, hit her doggy style
All the drip I got on got me soakin' now
Versace on, I can still whip it
I can be somewhere cold, I can still drip
Drip 'round my neck, that's a mil' ticket
It be a three piece suit, you can still get it
I got 99 problems, but the drip ain't one
You ain't gotta fuck with me, don't make me nothin'
I'ma drip, drip down, I'ma drip, drip down
If you wanna buy a drip, I can sell you somethin'

[Chorus]
I got drip for sale (Drip), I got drip for sale (Damn)
I got drip for sale (Drip), I got drip for sale (Damn)
I got drip for sale (Drip), I got drip for sale (Drip)
I got drip for sale (Drip), I got drip for sale (Damn)
