[Plies talking]
Bruh bruh (bruh bruh)
I got 'bout 80 stacks in my pockets right now bruh bruh
(Wanna rob myself, wanna rob myself, wanna rob myself)
And this the first time I ever though about robbin' myself bruh bruh
(Wanna rob myself, wanna rob myself, wanna rob myself)
I was walkin' 'round in my crib last night and said, "Damn, I wanna rob myself"

[Hook]
I'm a million dolla nigga (Wanna rob myself)
I'm in the coupe windows clear
(Wanna rob myself)
Seventy-thousand in my ears (Wanna rob myself)
This a half a mill right here
(Wanna rob myself)
I'm a million dolla nigga (Wanna rob myself)
I'm in the coupe windows clear
(Wanna rob myself)
Seventy-thousand in my ears (Wanna rob myself)
This a half a mill right here
(Wanna rob myself)


[Verse 1]
Hey Plies it's a robbery, get up!
I'm talkin' to myself though, what the fuck?
GL450, that's the biggest truck
Yo jewelry 'gainst mine nigga put it up
This a robbery don't move, don't buck
Got eighty stacks in my pocket nigga I gotta bump
Tight jeans don't work when your pockets stuffed
Another one-fifty in the whip add it up
I talk big boy shit so I gotta bust
Got the forty on my waist right by my gut
Say she like a nigga jewelry but don't touch
I wanna rob myself bitch I know wassup

[Hook]

I'm a million dolla nigga (Wanna rob myself)
I'm in the coupe windows clear
(Wanna rob myself)
Seventy-thousand in my ears (Wanna rob myself)
This a half a mill right here
(Wanna rob myself)


[Verse 2]
Looked in my garage and I got nervous
Half a mill worth a cars I ain't James Worthy
Know my neighbors must be sayin' this nigga ridin' dirty
Momma was washin' my clothes and said she found thirty
Thirty stacks and I ain't missed it must mean I ain't hurtin'
Told her gon' keep it buy some more damn detergent
I ain't bought nothin' all day I feel like a virgin
Don't step on my rug cause this shit Persian
I ain't playing that's what the interior decorator told me
Let me have some of my foam cause the nigga owe me
Told me he was on the dick that's how the nigga sold me
I'mma hit 'em in his shit, that's what I told 'em

[Hook 2x]
I'm a million dolla nigga (Wanna rob myself)
I'm in the coupe windows clear
(Wanna rob myself)
Seventy-thousand in my ears (Wanna rob myself)
This a half a mill right here
(Wanna rob myself)

[Verse 3]
Count a mill and a half and I'll stop countin'
Took some pictures of that shit that shit look like a mountain
Said, "God damn I can buy a lot of houses"
Said, "Hell nah, that'll send me ??"
And you snitchin' ass niggas, ya'll need some snitchin' counseling
First forty-eight a nigga man you niggas wild'n
I don't fuck wit checks
'Dey got to worry 'bout 'em bouncin'
I'm a strip club nigga that deal with cash only
Reason I bought that fuckin' Bentley, I was kinda lonely
Felt like a bachelorship wit nobody on me
I'mma rob myself bruh in one moment
Got some real fuckin' clear diamonds fuckin' on me

[Hook]
I'm a million dolla nigga (Wanna rob myself)
I'm in the coupe windows clear
(Wanna rob myself)
Seventy-thousand in my ears (Wanna rob myself)
This a half a mill right here
(Wanna rob myself)
I'm a million dolla nigga (Wanna rob myself)
I'm in the coupe windows clear
(Wanna rob myself)
Seventy-thousand in my ears (Wanna rob myself)
This a half a mill right here
(Wanna rob myself)
