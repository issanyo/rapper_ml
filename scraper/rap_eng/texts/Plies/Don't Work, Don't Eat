[Chorus]
You say you hustle all day and you grind all week
Listen, you don't work, you don't eat
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
You say you hustle all day and you grind all week
Listen, you don't work, you don't eat
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
That's the sound of the boy
Putting work off in this game
This game
That's the sound of the boy
Putting work off in this game
Game, all day long, they say

[Verse 1: Plies]
In these streets, nigga, you just stunting or you watching
You're either a nigga getting jumped or you're the nigga jocking
Getting money part of my religion, it ain't a hobby
Ain't talking tennis shoe money, I'm talking real dollars
Like they told me, a closed mouth don't get fed
But how I feel, a broke motherfucker better off dead
You can either beg for it, or go out and get it
The streets always hiding, that's on you, pimping
'Cause when you broke, all that shit you talking called wishing
Money make miracles, broke make liars
In these streets, you don't need a résumé to get hired
'Cause when you're your own boss, you can't get fired

[Chorus]
You say you hustle all day and you grind all week
Listen, you don't work, you don't eat
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
You say you hustle all day and you grind all week
Listen, you don't work, you don't eat
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
That's the sound of the boy
Putting work off in this game
This game
That's the sound of the boy
Putting work off in this game
Game, all day long, they say

[Verse 2: Plies]
Street nigga, I know how to get mines out the mud
From my wrist, I'm free to get it, I want all love
Conversation ain't enough, nigga, for me to budge
This money shit the only thing niggas willing to die for
The same cash nigga's hoes wouldn't have fucked for
I remember I used to be happy with a quarter bird money
Until I found out it was different levels of stunting
You got niggas that got it, you got niggas that's fronting
I got to hustle, nigga, I got too many habits
Ain't that nigga that point, I'm that nigga that grab it
Disrespect first, nigga, and then cabbage
Nothing funny, I dont' remember seeing too broke niggas laughing

[Chorus]
You say you hustle all day and you grind all week
Listen, you don't work, you don't eat
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
You say you hustle all day and you grind all week
Listen, you don't work, you don't eat
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
That's the sound of the boy
Putting work off in this game
This game
That's the sound of the boy
Putting work off in this game
Game, all day long, they say

[Verse 3: Plies]
Four in the morning, nigga, pill man still working
So while you sleep, the graveyard shift just opened
Cash the only thing that keep a street nigga focused
The dope game overcrowded, I don't know if you know this
And everybody can't eat, so I hope you know this
Some niggas stand in the kitchen, some niggas chase cars
Some niggas sell softy, some niggas sell hard
If your hustle game fucked up, you better find a job

[Chorus]
You say you hustle all day and you grind all week
Listen, you don't work, you don't eat
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
You say you hustle all day and you grind all week
Listen, you don't work, you don't eat
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
That's all a nigga know, that's all a nigga know
That's the sound of the boy
Putting work off in this game
This game
That's the sound of the boy
Putting work off in this game
Game, all day long, they say
