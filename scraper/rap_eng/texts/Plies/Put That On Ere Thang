[Intro (echoe):]
Raise your right hand
Do you swear to tell the truth
The whole truth, and nothing but the truth
So help you "GOD"

[Hook:]
I put that on ere thang, put that on ere thang
I put that on ere thang, i put that on ere thang
I put that on ere thang, i put that on ere thang
I put that on ere thang, on ere thang
I put that on ere thang, I put that on ere thang
I put that on ere thang, I put that on ere thang
I put that on ere thang, I put that on ere thang
I put that on ere thang, on ere thang

[Verse 1:]
I'm a buy the bottles all I need y'all to is do its pop em
And I'm a front the hoes all I need y'all to do is pass em
So don't pull up on round me
Keep that shit in ya pocket
Im on top right now, so all of us got it
If I got it to y'all got it, that all ways been the motto
Stay solid cause we know, that money can make hallow
I'ma keep gettin money, and I'ma keep dodgin these pot holes
And keep these niggas out my bidness, and keep fuckin these dumb hoes
Gotta keep gettin it, that's the only way I won't lose
I'ma keep flossin hard, any the way that I choose
Stay down and come up, flip da and re-up
I'm on top right now, a couple me whipped up

[Hook:]
[Echoe voice]
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth..

[Verse 2:]
Money ain't no problem so I can eat wherever i wanna
Drink whatever I wanna, and wear whatever I wanna
The streets know my story, I'm just a nigga who came from nothin
But I don't 'cause "ya". this shit b on the glory
You only live once, they gon' remember me when I'm gone
And as long as I got it, I damn sure gon' put on
But rule number one on you gettin money
Is put yor nigga on that debt..then now, guess what?
The whole team shows
It feel good now I got the fuck niggas from rhymin
And now the goal is for me to stay up out the county
It feel good now I got to fuck niggas from rhymin
And now the goal is to stay up out the county

[Hook:]
I put that on ere thang, i put that on ere thang
I put that on ere thang, i put that on ere thang
I put that on ere thang, I put that on ere thang, on ere thang
I put that on ere thang, I put that on ere thang
I put that on ere thang, I put that on ere thang
I put that on ere thang, I put that on ere thang
I put that on ere thang, on ere thang, I put that on ere thang..
