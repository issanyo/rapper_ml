[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay yo, this Plies, the new nigga over here at Slip-n-Slide Records
Ay, this for all my gutta motherfucking niggas
And all my real motherfucking hoes, man
Ay, I'm finna play it like this right now, dog
I want y'all niggas to do me a favor, dog
And go on and bring them choppers out for your dog

[Chorus]
Get your AK, I got my AK
Get your AK, I got my AK
Get your AK, I got my AK
Get your AK, I got my AK

[Verse 1]
If I can't slide with my fire, then I ain't going in
I'd rather post outside and wait on the club to end
'Cause if you caught without that fire, then you a dead man
So if you see me in the club, that mean I'm packing, then
And at that point, pussy ass nigga, I'm all in
So while you spending your money on her, I'm buying guns
'Cause that's the fastest way to come up, it's to take something
Don't let them pills be the reason you get knocked off
I don't pop them, but I stay up all night, boy
In the bushes with iron in all black, boy
And I ain't slipping, nigga, mine in my lap, boy
And I don't leave the house, nigga, if I ain't strapped, boy
And that flag gon' get you pussy niggas whacked, boy
And if you're with me, here's a dope boy jack boy

[Chorus]
Get your AK, I got my AK
Get your AK, I got my AK
Get your AK, I got my AK
Get your AK, I got my, I got my
Get your AK, I got my AK
Get your AK, I got my AK
Get your AK, I got my AK
Get your AK, I got my, I got my

[Verse 2]
And this one here might be a little too gutta for you
'Cause if you ain't thugging and swinging iron, I ain't make it for you
And I don't concern myself with lames missing tooth
My fanbase is gutta motherfuckers and real niggas
And y'all rappers can have the rest of these pussy niggas
'Cause at my shows, it's a crowd of hoes and drug dealers
And I roll with ex-cons and habitual felons
And hang at spots, nigga, where everybody got pistols
The streets love me 'cause I give them what they want, nigga
These industry niggas ain't cool with me 'cause I'm a threat
That's why I ain't spoke to half of these fuck niggas yet
But they'll love me if I was out here dropping bullshit
But the truth of the matter, nigga, I'm gutta as it get
And niggas that know me know that I'm living this shit
And let you niggas tell it all, y'all chopper told them
But I ain't heard about you taking it off a nigga shoulder

[Interlude]
Ay, when y'all niggas see me, dog
And y'all are selling some guns, holla at me, dog
I'm looking for a MAC-11 right now, dog
Any AKs, Glock 40s, SKs that y'all got
Y'all holla at me when y'all see me, dog

[Chorus]
Get your AK, I got my AK
Get your AK, I got my AK
Get your AK, I got my AK
Get your AK, I got my, I got my
Get your AK, I got my AK
Get your AK, I got my AK
Get your AK, I got my AK
Get your AK, I got my, I got my

[Outro]
And you police ass niggas, boy
Niggas ain't shooting in the leg no more
It's all head shots, fuck nigga
