[Verse 1]
Just bought a new choppa, name that bitch Clara
Hundred rounder with a scope on it, like shootin' fish in a barrel
Heard a couple niggas want it with me, tell them niggas get at me
Better check with your mama first, make sure you got some insurance
Ion' beef with pussies, y'all niggas be borin'
Don't go to war 'less your money right, nigga that's why I'm goin'
Ion' keep my money in my house, I keep mine in storage
Y'all niggas ain't no killers, y'all niggas just stories
Ol' Pinocchio ass nigga, you ain't never got dirty
Oh you bangin' now, why you wait to do it in your 30's?
I'm smoking on that loud, my niggas smoking on dirties
Don't tell it to me in subliminals, nigga tell it to me in person

[Hook]

Nann nigga, nann nigga, nann nigga
Nann nigga, nann nigga, nann nigga

[Verse 2]
Need me a new lighter, tryin' to find my dope
Million dollars worth of cars nigga, all of 'em in a row
When I bought that Ghost, bitch came with a bow
Shout out to the fuck boy who charge me with RICO
Niggas speak when they see me, then they hate on the low
I understand what you goin' through, nigga I used to be broke
If you know that you a fuck nigga, what you spoke to me for?
Why I'm still buyin' yoppers? This all that I know
If your ho leave with me, that's all she wrote
I taught her how to suck dick, what you mad at me for?
Emotional lil' nigga, y'all niggas be trippin'
I'm smoking one with my boxers on nigga, standing up in my kitchen

[Hook]
Ion' see nann nigga
Nann nigga, nann nigga, nann nigga
Nann nigga, nann nigga, nann nigga
Ion' see nann nigga

Nann nigga, nann nigga, nann nigga
Ion' see nann nigga
Nann nigga, nann nigga, nann nigga
Nann nigga, nann nigga, nann nigga
Ion' see nann nigga
Nann nigga, nann nigga, nann nigga
Nann nigga, nann nigga, nann nigga

[Verse 3]
Keep lettin' them niggas put a bat on your back
I just hope that them same niggas help you carry your casket
Don't tell me shit 'bout what them niggas said, them niggas just rappin'
Fuck niggas be bluffing, killers make shit happen
Talk shit but don't do shit, nigga you oughta be embarrassed
Talking loud and frowning up, I guess you were just actin'
But that's how y'all cowards do it, talk shit and don't back it
Like Pimp C told y'all niggas, I'll buy one of you pussies

[Hook]
Ion' see nann nigga

Nann nigga, nann nigga, nann nigga
