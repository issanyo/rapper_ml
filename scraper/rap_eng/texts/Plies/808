[Verse 1]
Calling my request and for about the hundredth time
DJ, Mr. DJ tryna get you on the line
Girl you heard this word before so I don't mean to keep you
But I never felt this, that's how I know my girl's a keeper
Baby I made you so mad, said things I can't take them back oh oh oh
I know I messed up so bad, tell her I'm feeling so sad
Please could you help me with that? Oh!

[Hook]
DJ drop me a beat and put that 808 on it
I'm sending a message to my babe
Said she's finished with me, but she gotta know I'm hurting
And I think that she listens to this sta-sta-tion
Gotta get her back on this track so please
Would you put that 808, put that 808 on it
Take her back to the days when we was falling in love
DJ put me that 808 on your drum, on your drum

[Verse 2]
Heard her shoes walk out the door, it was just about 8:08
She told me she was up and done and I should've made her stay
I just let it go, grab that remote turn on the Steelers
She jumped onto the a26 to the 95 and now I'll never see her
Oh no, no I can't take that back, I know I messed up so bad
So I need just to special this track

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Plies]
I know for hurting you baby, God gon' punish me
I shouldn't of played with your heart cause you were too sweet
I wasn't ready to settle down, I was too street
I was a sexaholic, I was too weak
All of the promises I made you, I couldn't keep
I was too whorish for you, you deserve better then me
Get married, raise a family, how it's supposed to be
But getting money, chasing women got the best of me

[Bridge]
The first time that I saw her, I can't forget those songs
Thought I could live without her, now she's just all I want
I miss the way she kissed me, I think about it everyday
Everytime I turn on the radio I hear that 808

[Hook]
