[Intro: Plies]
I wanna see you smile you know what I’m saying
You always got your mouth open about somebody
But you know I know how to bae smile though

[Verse 1: Plies]
Wanna keep them perms in your hair, put them heels on your feet
Put that furniture in your house, and put that leather on your seat
Bring you oxtails to work, just to make sure you eat
And keep money in your pocket, even when you don’t get paid that week
Just wanna see you smile, so tired of seeing you cry
You work hard, I’m sick of seeing you tired
Send you to them Chinese people, so they can paint your nails
Give you a couple of hundred dollars for doing your hair
When you happy baby, I’m happy when you sad it hurts
I love to see you smile, looking like you came out of church
I came by your house late, it was three in the morning
All I can say is we had us one hell of a morning

[Hook: Rico Love]
And sometime I know, you need somebody
To stay around, to make you smile
And baby I ain’t scared, to be that somebody
To stay around, to make you smile
I only holding you down
(Be somebody, wanna be that somebody
Be somebody, wanna be that somebody
Be somebody, wanna be that somebody)
To make you smile
(Turn the lights off)

[Verse 2: Plies]
I love being right there, every time you fall asleep
Love rubbing on your back, so you know that it’s me
You my backbone, and I’m the one that hold you up
All that other shit can wait, when you wanna get cuffed
Shit you momma know my momma, which mean it’s legit
I done had my share of women, but nothings close to this
You gotta real nigga thinking ‘bout jumping the broom
Or putting the playa card down, or that might be too soon
I’m trying to free you of your pain, and put joy in your eyes
I know I’ve said this shit before, but bae I mean it this time
You deserve the best, and how I feel I deserve the same
You deserve a real nigga, and I deserve a Queen

[Hook]
