[Verse]
Ain’t never gave a fuck ‘bout what another bitch thought of me
Shit that really bothered other niggas never bothered me
Since I can remember, I ain’t never been emotional
Never gave a fuck about a bitch I wasn’t supposed to
Never lost track of what the motherfucking plan was
Money make a motherfucking nigga kill his own blood
Since I was a little bitty boy, I told it how it was
Moving fast and not thinking, nigga, get you fucked up
Had to learn the hard way, you had to put some money up
Only way to not get hurt is not to give a fuck
One thing I Iearned about life, nigga, live it up
He ever try to rob him, tell him, “nah, I ain’t give it up”
What I love about a gangster nigga, we don’t talk much
One thing about a pussy nigga, he talk too much
Only way to find that nigga real, let him [?] up
Nigga, I believe in God and believe in hustle, I don’t believe in luck
Got a cousin, got a couple soldiers, nigga, sew it up
Twenty million dollars later, nigga, I ain’t made enough
You ever get in that interrogation room, don’t let them shake you
A motherfucking lawyer ain’t present, I ain’t saying nothing
Bitch get on my motherfucking nerves every time, I swear they do
You don’t want to work and talk shit, bitch, the nerve of you
Couldn’t have been that nigga where you from, I ain’t heard of you
Fuck a nigga, fuck his best friend is what a bird will do
All I ever wanted was a million dollar lifestyle
Keep my motherfucking circle small and let the money pile
Seeing how they did Aaron Hernandez up in trial
One fuck up in these streets and they’re gon’ max you out
Riding with a doobey [?] I had a long night
For all the paper I ever ran through, I’m trying to make it back
Trying to get to this fucking money, nigga, day and night
Sometime, you got to do wrong just to live right
Whatever it take to feed the fucking fam, I’ll pay the price
Remember being broke, I swear to God I couldn’t sleep at night
Think before I speak ‘cause when I say it, I don’t take it back
Pussy wasn’t good the first time, I won’t fuck you twice
If they ever give mics for being real, they’d give me 5 mics
Nigga killed your dog ‘cause he snitched, it was only right
Motherfucking pressure break you down, ask Suge Knight
Wasn’t no motherfucking diss, nigga, I’m the same fight
If I ever called you a fuck nigga, it was personal
Ever ask me about a bitch, I ought to murder you
After God made me, I feel he broke the fucking mold
Showed love to a lot of niggas that broke the fucking code
Got the upmost respect for every nigga who never told
Feel the same way about the nigga, they get it off the stove
I’m so focused on the money, I don’t fuck with bitches on the road
Love a bad bitch, but she ain’t more important than the dough
Had a dream one of these pussies made me pull it at a show
Guess it wasn’t no fucking dream ‘cause I done did that shit before
These niggas wearing clothes tighter than these hoes nowadays
These niggas sweeter than a bitch, I don’t care what none of y’all say
I don’t laugh and play with fuck niggas ‘cause I ain’t with the jokes
Ain’t got to play the games these pussy niggas play ‘cause I ain’t broke
Can’t be fucking up with you niggas, dog, ‘cause I already know
A fuck nigga, he can’t hide it, dog, his pussy gon’ show
As God to bless the real niggas that still on the block
Had to buy Louis XIII, 300 a shot
Got to fuck a bitch with something going ‘cause I don’t do the thot
Got to slide by myself, too many niggas be getting popped
I’m just a hood nigga in a 5-star restaurant in a tanktop
I was just at the bottom, all I thought about was getting to the top
It don’t surprise me what a fuck nigga do, ain’t never sharp
Kinda hard making the honor roll when your daddy smoke rock
I was knee deep when niggas was wearing Girbauds and Reeboks
What’s the point of hanging around niggas if they who you got to watch?
Real niggas, don’t let these fuck nigga out and box you out
Get money, live life, nigga, that’s what it’s all about
If you want to get money, then hang around niggas getting money
If you want to be shit then hang around people who ain’t doing nothing
One thing I ain’t got time for is a bitch that act funny
Get some money, dog, I swear, ‘cause being broke, that shit lonely
2000, last time I put trust in a ho
Been in love, I guess it’s true that having money mean more
Weigh the dope on the counter, count the money on the floor
‘Fore you open the door for them, you better look out the peephole
They say keep your friends close, but keep your enemies even closer
If you’re my enemy, you’re my enemy, no fucking way I’m bringing you closer
Been evicted too many times, that shit can fuck with a nigga mind
Cute face and good pussy, that shit can fuck with a nigga grind
The ones that ain’t got shit going the ones who specialize in lying
If you don’t show love to your soldiers, they’re gon’ cross you every time
Made my mind up in elementary, bitch, I’m going for mine
I know a lot of niggas in the pin that’s doing homeboys time
They kept it real but their homeboys ain’t send them near a dime
Just a message to the street niggas, you better know who riding
Don’t know what tomorrow gon’ bring, so I’ma ball every day
You might as well gon’ run it ‘cause I ain’t got shit to say
I’m that nigga growing up, used the shoebox for a safe
Where I’m from, if you ain’t got it, then you pay that shit late
Remember back in the day, all I ever wanted was a steak
Got my feet up under me, nigga, then I wanted that estate
Whatever you do, put some money on the side for a case
Pussy and attention, nigga, that’s just something I never chase
They say money don’t make you real, but being broke don’t neither
If you ain’t grinding how I’m grinding, then bitch, we ain’t equal
Be careful who you help, ‘cause motherfuckers get amnesia
Feel the same way about a nigga and a ho, bitch, I don’t need ya
Gone
