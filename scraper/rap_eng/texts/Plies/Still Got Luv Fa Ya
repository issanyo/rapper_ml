[Intro]
Still got luv fa ya though
Still got luv fa ya though
Still got luv fa ya though
Still got luv fa ya though
Still got luv fa ya though

[Plies]
I don't know if you're fucking or you ain't
But I don't trust ya cause I ain't all in ya business
You might think that i'm a sucker
I don't need you for shit
I get mind off the muscle
I ain't beefin' with you baby still got love for ya
Had to reset 'fore I jump in the deep end
When the vibe ain't right kinda hard to pretend
When you tell me that you love me that some real deep words
Somebody else could get it too it ain't yours
Do you know how i'm rocking don't let people in
Cause my past fucked up that why my trust paper thin
Don't want nobody else to have me you just want me for yourself
I understand all that but you too much to yourself
I don't put nobody before you
Don't you put nobody before me
Phone lie on your fur and please don't lie to me
Sometime you think i'm sneaking sometime you think i'm not
Sometime you think i'm fucking sometime you think I won't

[Chorus: Plies]
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though

[Kodak Black]
You violated baby God damn it
And I don't really do no second chances
And first of all baby I ain't even romantic
But every thug need a ladywho always understand him
Finesse kid, if I was you I woulda took advantage
Or ran up to a friend that I knew since elementary
See me, I be running with the people that I ran with
Now i'm 'boutta see where her head is
See if I could skeet get her pregnant
I don't want her in the streets bih, nah-uhh
Want a smart bitch with street standards
But I ain't say I want fleek Kylie Jenner
I treat her like my baby I pamper
And when she go to acting crazy Imma pimp her
I don't even think my friends can get her
Heartbreak Kodak i'm the one who bring that love for ya

[Chorus: Plies]
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though
Still got love for ya but I can't fuck with ya though
