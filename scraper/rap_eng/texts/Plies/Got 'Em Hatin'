(Verse 1:)
Seven Days A Week, A Full Time balla
A Thug And A Goon, Whatever You Wanna Call It
You Hatin For Nothin, Cuz I'ma Get Money regardless
You Tryin To Catch Lil Mama, I Already Done Caught Her
You Want The 26s, Huh, I Already Done Bought Em
You Can't Do What I Do And That's Part Of The Problem
I Got The Haters Goin Crazy I Ain't Trying To Stop Em
You Want The Streets, Huh Dog, I Already Done Locked Em
You Love Blue Diamonds, Already Done Copped Em
You Always Talk About K's, But Ain't Never Shot Em
I'm Certified And Real, Lil Homey You A Flawer
You A Full-Blown Hater, That's What I Call Em

(Chorus:)
I'm In The Donk On Sixes And Stay (Got Em Hatin)
F**ked The Broad That He Wanted (Now I Got Em Hatin)
His Paper Game Ain't Been Right Lately (Got Em Hatin)
My Jewelery Game Amazin (Now I Got Em Hatin)
I'm In The Donk on Sixes And Stay (Got Em Hatin)
F**ked The Broad That He Wanted (Now I Got Em Hatin)
His Paper Game Ain't Been Right Lately (Got Em Hatin)
You Ain't Doin Somethin Right If You Ain't (Got Em Hatin)

(Verse 2:)
I'm The Man In My City, You Just Live Here

You Just Got In The Streets, I've Been Out Chea
You Still Dreamin About It, I Did It In A Year
You A Pussy So I Know You Hate Me Off The Rip
You Can't Move How I Move, You Ain't Got Chips
I Can Blow It And Don't Miss It, Got Grip
I Can Merc You When I Wanna, Cuz I Got Clips
30-Round Extended .380 On The Hip
Heard You Was Cryin When You Was Locked Up, You A Trip
I Know The Goons That Robbed You, You Ain't Done Shit
You The One That Told, You The One Soft As Shit
Now You Walkin Round Like You Had Closed Lips
In The Back Of Yo Mind You Wish Plies Wadn't Real
Ain't Never Been A Hater, I Don't Know How It Feel
If You Know Like I Know, Lil Homey, Better Chill
Or You Gon' Have Them Bushes Movin In Frontcha Crib

(Chorus)

(Verse 3:)
Some Wanna See Me Broke, Some Wanna See Me In The Feds
The Haters Hate You When You Livin, Love You When You're Dead
He Just A Bad Rapper, He Ain't Blew Yet
The Streets Don't Feel Him, I Ain't Have To Go Through That
I'm On Fire In The Streets, Just Got My Feet Wet
And You Don't Think I'ma Sell A Mil', Then Take The Bet
I'm Just One Of Few Who Ain't Went Commercial Yet
I Want You To See Me Dats Why I Got The Top Back
You Got No Choice To Talk About Me, Look How I Act
And Why Plies So Wired If He Got Stacks
He Got A Hundred Goons Around Him When He Rock His Ice
If You Ain't Thuggin, You Won't Understand The Thug Life

(Chorus: To Fade)
