Fresh out the house, got the beat on suicide
As I ride up and down Martin Luther King Drive
(Do ya thang)
Standin' tall, lookin' down on the bloody boys
Snitchin' all day, I look around on the block
I'm in a silver SL five pounder on the block
Ain't cha ever seen a young player clown on the Drop?
(Do ya thang)
Ain't nuttin' to a G gang spit fluently
Groups of hoe's pursuin' me as if there's more than two of me
Monday my Chevy's orange and Tuesday it's ocean blue
28's sit over you, Ferrari drops and Rovers too
(Do ya thang)
Hoes sit 'em out, TVs I'ma flip 'em out
50 bricks, they ain't shit, tell 'em niggas, shift it out
I'm comin' down, shinin' rose gold, feelin' like a mag poles
Cadillac with five hoes, make these suckers hate mo'
(Do ya thang)
Damn right pimp, we do this every night
With the same big faces, make these lame hoes bite
I got that top down
(Top down)
I got the tints now
(Tints now)
I got it real now
(Real now)
I want some bluts now
(Some bluts now)

I'm in the hood in a drop top, super-sport, mesh leather horses, holla
And the Porsche is fallin' niggas, on their porches, holla
(Do ya thang)
They call me 'Thunder Bill', cut me down to somethin' else
Shawty somethin' else, hot enough to make the sukas melt
Man, I got a scoop loop Chevy, followin' me no 24
Look at your own Cutlass green diamond, purple hearts bro
(Do ya thang)
A James Bond's car, drizzled as a porn star
Spring we was green, so my Cutlass is a orange car
I got a curly haired, dirty red broad, eatin' lemon heads
Leanin' in the Lincoln with a pump by her left leg
(Do ya thang)
Lookin' in the tan and getcha left side bend
Leave ya laid out and lay, do it by the lake bitch
Color coated rims chop the streets till they rock up
Muscle cars straight buckin', look how it stands up
(Do ya thang)
Yeah, I'm in the ride look like a fruit drink
It makes these hoes thirsty when they see the pineapple paint
I got that top down
(Top down)

Baby, let green drop coupes that cream
Bling earrings in my ear look like a baby flat screen
(Do ya thang)
I'm doin it, my neck piece green, ice rubberliscous perk
I'ma Grand Hustle king
Yeah, this 'Super-Clean' is on the scene
Italian leather match the Polo boots
And the wood grain lame, I'll show you how to do the do
(Do ya thang)
Blowin' fruits same flavor as the candy gloss
In the backseat, got a freak pullin' her panties off
Arr, weigh the anchor on the Cuban link chain
Diamonds stacked on top of diamonds, custom made pinky ring
(Do ya thang)
Fishin' hats, Polo shorts with the Polo man
Wearin' blue and tan in the blue and tan Avalanche
Jackers never had a chance, set them in the Avalanche
They hopped out the van and startin' shootin' like a cameraman
(Do ya thang)
Top down, hit the switch and let it drop down
Passin' by the underground, they can hear me underground
I got that top down
(Top down)
