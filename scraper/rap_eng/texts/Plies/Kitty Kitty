[Intro: Plies]
If you a bad lit kitty, kitty
And you see me in the streets or in the club
And you tryna get my attention
Just purr

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, here, kitty, kitty
Here, kitty, kitty, here, kitty, kitty
Make your body purr, purr, purr, purr, purr

[Verse 1: Plies]
I'm lookin' for the right kitty, nice walk, nice fur
She got a real strong stand with a real soft purr
Want a clean kitty who like hoes in the dirt
Wanna lay in your lap, rub her face in your shirt
And she super, super timid, she don't like to move fur
Got a solid lil frame with a nice set of curves
And she sleep in a box, what I love about her
Love to hang by herself, love to stand in front the mirror
Got nice long legs, look good in her skirts
And I have this flow when she ride in reverse
She don't never say much when you feed her, she just purr
You can play with her feet, touch her tail, she jerks
She just like a kitty, show her teeth when it hurt
Gotta lil attitude, that can use a little work
Wanna make her close her eyes, rub her stomach, it works
If you want my attention when you see me, just purr

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, here, kitty, kitty
Here, kitty, kitty, here, kitty, kitty
If you come I'll make you purr
Here, kitty, kitty, let me rub your fur
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, here, kitty, kitty
Here, kitty, kitty, here, kitty, kitty
If you come I'll make you purr
Here, kitty, kitty, let me rub your fur

[Verse 2: Plies]
Wanna rub away them toes, talk to her when I'm bored
Keep the kitty in the house, so it never get ignored
Wanna top notch kitty, one everybody can't afford
Let the top straight back, sit that kitty in the Porsche
Drive the kitty round the city, let the air cool her off
I'ma pat, pat, pat her, every time the kitty cold
Keep her close to me, don't want the kitty gettin' lost
You ain't ridin' with a lame, babe, you ridin' with the boss
Got that nice set of eyes, just like a lil kitty
Run your hands through her fur 'cause her ass so pretty
How she follow you around, how you know when she with it
She purr, purr, purr, every time you get it
I'm in the middle of the club, hollerin', meow, meow
Purr, purr, purr, that's that kitty sound, kitty sound
Here kitty, kitty, let me pat it out, pat it out
Not white diamonds but they yack brown

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, here, kitty, kitty
Here, kitty, kitty, here, kitty, kitty
If you come I'll make you purr
Here, kitty, kitty, let me rub your fur
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, here, kitty, kitty
Here, kitty, kitty, here, kitty, kitty
If you come I'll make you purr
Here, kitty, kitty, let me rub your fur

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
I know exactly where you'd like me to touch you
So I'ma feel up on it, touch up on it, kiss up on it, rub up on it
I know that you need my love when we leave this club
I don't wanna rush 'cause I need so much time to fuck you

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, here, kitty, kitty
Here, kitty, kitty, here, kitty, kitty
If you come I'll make you purr
Here, kitty, kitty, let me rub your fur
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, here, kitty, kitty
Here, kitty, kitty, here, kitty, kitty
