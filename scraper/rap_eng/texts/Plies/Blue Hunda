[Intro: Plies]
Blue Hunda, Blue Hunda, Blue Hunda, Blue Hunda
Blue Hunda, Blue Hunda, Blue Hunda, Blue Hunda


[Hook: Plies]
All I got is Blue Hundas, Blue Hundas, Blue Hundas, Blue Hundas
All I got is Blue Hundas, Blue Hundas, Blue Hundas, Blue Hundas
All I got is Blue Hundas, Blue Hundas, Blue Hundas, Blue Hundas
All I got is Blue Hundas, Blue Hundas, Blue Hundas, Blue Hundas
All I got is Blue Hundas

[Verse 1: Plies]
Don’t ask me for no change I ain’t got none
I heard he going broke better pray for him
You catch me in the club with a block on me
Don’t do it to yourself I got the Glock on me
It feel real good to have a stack homie
I don’t care ‘bout the hoe so you can back-door me
550 what I paid for my first onion
I you owe me you ain’t pay me nigga I don’t want nothing
What they say shit what go around come around
I’ma act like it’s all good but I’ma lay ya down
You were flacking you ain’t got it you a shit eater
Fuck niggas want verses I don’t do either
Catch me in the strip club on the day shift
We spray the party up that’s a face lift
Top notch 49 50 that’s the quick flip
Ask the hoes about me nigga I leave a big tip

[Hook: Plies]

[Verse 2: Plies]
If you looking for me I’m standing on the couch man
Blowing kush out my nose fuck what you think
These hoes will say they love ya if your bread right
? nigga over night
I’m a different kind of nigga I’m in elite class
And outbang every nigga in my weight class
Like Soulja Slim said I’ll pay for it
But one thing I won’t do I won’t wait for it
Still wearing white-tee’s like a d-boy
And still slide though the city in a decoy
I used to like stacks now I like m’s now
I used to fuck broke bitches I don’t see em now
Like they say nigga money over everything
My motherfucking brother the only thing that ain’t changed
I get money fuck bitches that’s my lifestyle
Real nigga certain things we don’t talk about
