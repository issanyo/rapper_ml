[Intro]
Bruh I got a lil homeboy bruh, that really be on all that dope bruh, and them pills'll have his ass chirpin bruh, 4, 5, 6, 7 o'clock in the morning, dawg out there chirpin'

[Chorus]
My dog just called me them pills got him chirpin'
Ask him what he doing he says shit just lurkin'
Big fire on him every nigga with him chirpin'
Can't sit still cause them pills got him chirpin'
Them pills got him chirpin', them pills got him chirpin'
Ask him what he doing he says shit just lurkin'
Big fire on him every nigga with him chirpin'
Can't sit still cause them pills got him chirpin'


[Verse 1]
Nigga can't sit still, nigga eyes won't close
Nigga hand on his fire, nigga eyes on the road
Nigga face feel numb, nigga body feel froze
Nigga bustin up the [?] , nigga firin' up the dope
Nigga mouth just twitchin' he can feel it in his toes
Nigga thinkin' bout' murkin' he ain't worried about a hoe
Nigga can't eat shit cause his appetite low
Keep looking at his pocket wanna pop one more
Nigga head on a swivel, nigga lock my door
Where the fuck this nigga going shit, he don't even know
Got stacks got fire go the fuck you wanna go
Nigga chirpin' like a bitch I can ya through the phone
Nigga eyes won't close, nigga can't go home
Nigga phone steady [?] Hollin' leave me alone
Nigga sweating like a bitch he in his motherfucking zone
And he gone chirp chirp chirp all night night long

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
He got that Glock Glock Glock on his God damn life
And if a big bitch try him he gon' knock him off the map
Wanna power back up just slide through the trap
Grab him two more pills then he bounce right back
Everybody with him chirpin', everybody with him strapped
Everybody got dope, everybody got racks, Everybody gone lurk
Everybody gone wack, everybody got skis, everybody all black
Ain't worried bout him he just chirpin' my nigga
Ol' pussy ass nigga keep that purp in my nigga
We count stack naked lady got him hurting my nigga
All that dope he on got him geeking my nigga
If the dope real good best believe he gon' chirp
If a nigga run down best believe he gon' murk
Niggas grillin biting down, got him hanging out the vert
And if you feel like me dog just chirp chirp chirp

[Chorus]

[Verse 3][Fella]
I'm jerkin I'm jerkin them pills got me twirling
All in my car swear I see them hoes lurkin'
He working don't serve him you need to go n murk him
I pop one more I swear to God I'm a hurt him
I'm drinking on brown and they drinking on purple
I ran out of X now I'm blowing on purple
Call the pill man up and tell him bring several
Been rolling all day man I think a see a shuttle
I just heard a knock man I hope it ain't the feds
I ain't trying go now cause I'm geeking too bad
Got bricks over here got pounds over there
I get caught with all this I'm a get 100 years
And I think I need a mouthpiece I can't shut up
We've been fucking all night and I still can't nut
And it gotta be the pills but I just can't quit
And I can't stop now cause I love this shit

[Chorus]
