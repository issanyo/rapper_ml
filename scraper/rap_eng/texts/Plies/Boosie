[Intro]
Ayy Boosie, I know you probably asleep my nigga
I been thinking about you dawg
I thought I'd holla at you my nigga

[Verse 1]
It's one in the morning Friday night all of my niggas in the club Instead of ballin with some bitches I'd rather show love
I'd rather send kites to the niggas that the world done snubbed
That's why I make music for the niggas that the rich won't hug
Anything can come out a nigga mouth, but the real in his blood
I make mistakes everyday so how can I judge?
When a nigga can't be you my nigga, that's when they hate you the worst
Real pain, and fake tears, I seen it at church
When you want the world to love you then that's when it hurt
Wishing bad on a real nigga, I never seen it work
In the dictionary love last but hate come first
Before I wrote this shit my nigga I prayed for you first

[Chorus]
Wonder if the kids you bought bikes for wrote you a letter
Wonder if the niggas you did a song with, have you heard from them niggas?
I wonder how many of your dogs done came by and visit ya
Wonder if the crackas you made millions even chopped it up with ya
Wonder if the hoes you used to fuck, even sent ya some pictures
Wonder if the niggas you called yo dawgs eitha for ya or against ya?
Ya whole situation done taught me alot my nigga
When you winnin niggahs hate ya; when ya down they against ya

[Verse 2]
It ain't a judge or prosecutor more powerful than god
Whatever you do my nigga don't let em take what's in your heart
Doing day for day and depending on niggas can be hard
Believe in you and keep your faith cause that's what's smart
Your mommy and your kids are the ones that love you from the start
They've seen the system break cliques and tear em apart
Staying prayed up my nigga is more important than a charge That's what real niggas do they pass it to god
The streets a muthafucka my nigga cause they switch and they change
It's hard for niggas to stay out here when there's pussies in the game
A nigga running with ya done flipped and go to spraying ya name
The crackas never know shit niggas put em on ya game

[Chorus]
Wonder if the kids you bought bikes for wrote you a letter
Wonder if the niggas you did a song with, have you heard from them niggas?
I wonder how many of your dogs done came by and visit ya
Wonder if the crackas you made millions even chopped it up with ya
Wonder if the hoes you used to fuck, even sent ya some pictures
Wonder if the niggas you called yo dawgs eitha for ya or against ya?
Ya whole situation done taught me alot my nigga
When you winnin niggahs hate ya; when ya down they against ya

[Verse 3]
In life my nigga all us slip and we fall
But that's the time to find out who really yo dawgs
Cause all these pussy niggas jump in when it's time to ball
But them ain't the same niggas that show up when it's time for war
And when the money gone my nigga so is the jewelry man Sometime he takes us through some shit to show us our friends
And most people they for self including your kin
My grandma always used to tell me with god you win
Put yo trust in a higher power and not in man
Cause when you fucking round with niggas it all depends
But a nigga lied to you before he gone lie to you again
In life my nigga love is what last in the end

[Chorus]
Wonder if the kids you bought bikes for wrote you a letter
Wonder if the niggas you did a song with, have you heard from them niggas?
I wonder how many of your dogs even came by and visit ya
Wonder if the crackas you made millions done chopped it up with ya
Wonder if the hoes you used to fuck, even sent ya some pictures
Wonder if the niggas you called yo dawgs eitha for ya or against ya?
Ya whole situation done taught me alot my nigga
When you winnin niggahs hate ya; when ya down they against ya

[Outro]
From me to you lil homie
Not only do I pray for you my nigga
I pray for every real nigga who locked up and tied down right now homie
When I said it'd never change with me it never changed with me
I'll never forget you nigga
When I say I salute it, I salute it
All my gangstas, all my real niggas
