[Intro]
I remember somebody asked me
If I think my life would of been different
If I would of had my daddy in my life
I thought about it for a minute
And then shit
I probably wouldn’t ever be shit if I had my daddy
The only reason I say that
Cuz without my daddy
I had to get out here and get it

[Hook]
I probably wouldn’t be shit if I had my daddy
My daddy, my daddy
If I had my daddy, my daddy
I probably wouldn’t be shit if I had my daddy
My daddy, my daddy
If I had my daddy, my daddy
I probably wouldn’t be shit if I had my daddy

[Verse 1]
Probably wouldn’t have saw before
Probably wouldn’t even know how to grind
Probably would of still been on the porch
Probably would of had a sheltered life
Bitch I had to go and get it
Had nobody hold my hand
Nigga I had to scrap for it
Same shit made me a man
Soon as my daddy left
Had to grow up fast
Couldn’t run to him for help
Had to get up off my ass
Had to get down in these trenches
Had to come up with a plan
Had to start making power moves
Nigga had to get some cash
Had to get my hands dirty
No more of that pretty shit
Nigga had to man up
Couldn’t ask my momma for shit
Dad I still fuck with him
Ain’t mad at him at all
Did what he had to do
I did what I had to dawg

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Momma was on E
Daddy was on dope
Brother was in the streets
I was just learning the ropes
Got tired of hearing no
Trying to hear yes sometimes
Got tired of begging people
Shit had to go for mine
Wasn’t there for school plays
Wasn’t there for graduation
Wasn’t there to pay rent
Wasn’t there for conversation
Add up my moves nigga
Use em for motivation
Out here head first
No time for contemplating
Know niggas that had dads
They couldn’t make it on their own
Know niggas without one
Grind like they fuckin grown
Come out they fold nigga
Back up against the wall
Tired of meeting them ceilings nigga
Had to make em my own

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I just look at it like that (that’s how I look at it)
I feel sometimes blessing in disguise, know what I’m sayin’
And it don’t mean I don’t fuck wit my ol’ boy
It’s just
A nigga that ain’t got their daddy
There’s the whole
Make a nigga grow up fast, know what I’m sayin’
Lot of shit I wouldn’t of known, lot of shit I would of never learned
If I had a nigga to hold my hand, know what I’m sayin’
When a nigga gotta go out here and get it
All bets off
Nigga can’t cry about it, nigga just gonna have to go and get it

[Hook]
