[Intro: Plies]
I guess we here again (we here again)
I don't think a lot of niggas really understand what
What I really stand on and what my purpose is (I don't think they know)
See I got in this shit
Strictly on principle (principle over money nigga)
Never gave a fuck about the money my nigga (never did)
I said to myself I won't stand for some of this shit
That had to be what I believed in (had to be standing on principles nigga)
See you got a lot of niggas that
Tell you one thing (they tell you one thing)
And them niggas do something else (they do something totally different)
You got a lot of niggas
That tell you what it ain't really is for real for real (I ain't gon say no names)
I understood from day one my nigga (day one nigga)
That wasn't everybody gon fuck wit me (only the real gon fuck wit me)
But my whole mission (my whole mission)
Was just to make sho (that's to make sho)
The right motherfuckers fuck wit me (oh the real gon fuck wit me)
See one thing ain't gon never be (what that is?)
Is a fuck nigga for no money
