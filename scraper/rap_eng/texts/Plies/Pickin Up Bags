[Chorus]
Ride picking up bags
They picked up another bag
Ride picking up bags
They picked up another bag

[Verse 1]
I'm in an all-white Ford
Looking like a glass of milk
All these blues in my pocket
Got me feeling like a prick
I got a model in the car
Feed the chicken wings fry
She told me rule like a boss
I told her please don't act surprised
She told her bestie she have my ass
I told her I already know
They bring me clothes outside
I rally overboard of snow

[Chorus]
Ride picking up bags
They picked up another bag
Ride picking up bags
They picked up another bag
Ride picking up bags
They picked up another bag
Ride picking up bags
They picked up another bag

[Verse 2]
He told me homie fire ex
I told him damn I forgot
Nigga timed overwhelm
I told the oval got shot
If I were you I'd roly you
For saying you carter had done
Got paid the mo's on the ticket
Don't give a fuck I hate lying
They say I got five million followers
They show you five million dollars
Since but for honey overrated
I suppose that lil shit don't allow you

[Chorus]
Ride picking up bags
They picked up another bag
Ride picking up bags
They picked up another bag
Ride picking up bags
They picked up another bag
Ride picking up bags
They picked up another bag

[Verse 3]
He said he want 20 drako
I want 20 million dollars
Broke nigga do all the shooting
Rich nigga do all the ball
Ain't me a lil jerk
Ain't had a chain to it yet
There's money bill in these strip clubs
She had probably more now
All the babies she can claw
I'm talking jelling like a shell
She like to get me all full
Then she fuck a nigga to death

[Chorus]
Ride picking up bags
They picked up another bag
Ride picking up bags
They picked up another bag
Ride picking up bags
They picked up another bag
Ride picking up bags
They picked up another bag
