[Intro]
I was fortunate enough, dog, as a young nigga
To see what a real nigga look like
I was raised during the real era
Where being a real nigga meant something, nigga

[Chorus]
I'm committed to being a real nigga and nothing else
100% real nigga, nothing less
I stand a real nigga till God take my last breath
I do this shit for the few real niggas in the streets left
I'm committed to being a real nigga and nothing else
100% real nigga, nothing less
I stand a real nigga till God take my last breath
I do this shit for the few real niggas in the streets left

[Verse 1]
I had a part time daddy, the streets made me a man
If I had to do it all over, I'd let the streets raise me again
The indictment showed me ain't no such thing as a real friend
I had to learn that a good heart, that shit'll do you in
Been fucked over by my homies, been fucked over by my kin
I'll bet one motherfucking thing: it won't happen again
A pussy nigga break, a real nigga don't bend
Don't trust a nigga that don't smile no more than you trust a nigga that grin
Don't know if Heaven is going to accept me, I got to many sins
I hope God don't overlook me, I hope he understand
Free all the real niggas in prison, give them one more chance
Until that happen, I'ma be they motherfucking spokesman

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Everything I claim to be, that's whats the streets tell me
This music shit just make stars, but the streets make legends
Not being real, but staying real, that's been my biggest blessing
These niggas hate you when you got it, that's been my biggest lesson
But ain't a hoe that can hurt me, ain't a nigga that can scare me
I was born to be a real nigga, so I'ma die one
100% real nigga, real as they come
Remember when being a real nigga used to mean something
These niggas rather you lie to them, the truth they run from
I'm a self made motherfucker, thanks, I owe none
The niggas that had it all done lost it, that's who I learn from
I'ma real nigga, 365, until I'm done

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Being a real nigga, that's a fuck nigga's dream
But that's a milestone that only a few niggas can obtain
This shit ain't about money, this shit ain't about fame
This shit a way life, it ain't about what you claim
Only God can judge me, that's some bullshit
You really felt like that, nigga? Why you trying to impress a bitch?
The streets' opinion matter, that's why I'm on G shit
My name is all I got, I'm willing to die for that shit
I won't change for nothing, what you see is what you get
A real nigga and a fuck nigga is something that don't mix
I got my own cash, never been a "yes man"
The few real niggas in the streets left, I'm your biggest fan

[Chorus]
