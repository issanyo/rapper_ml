[Verse 1:]
Come from work on 26s did that shit no photo
Only nigga in a Maybach that fuckin' went gold
First nigga in the city to put the Camaro on fo's
First nigga to brake bread with real niggas at his shows
Black diamonds ain't new I wore them two albums ago
Only nigga not platnum shellin out 40 racks a show
Ain't found a rap nigga these bitches love more
And if the deal wasn't done pussy nigga I ain't go
And if the nigga ain't real can't fool me I know
And if the label want commercial they can fucking let me go
And if the streets wasn't mine they would fucking let me know
And a nigga don't like me its cus he motherfucking broke

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
You can catch me in the strip club standin on the bar
You can catch me in the Maybach smoking me a 'gar
You can catch me in the hood, bitch running to my car
You can catch me with my dogs but them niggas chirpin hard
You can catch me in the mall bowlegged with ah wad
You can catch me in the trap with my niggas playing cards
You can catch me on the late night fucking with a broad
You can catch me and my brother back to back in them cars
You'll never catch me flagging you ain't fucking with a mob
Yeah I'm flameing like a bitch got the city on lock
If a nigga wanna play I'mma catch me a charge
Yea I'm finna go live like a motherfucking star

[Hook:]
