[Intro]
And I fuck with these niggas
Jim Jonsin, Bigg D

[Chorus]
Bitch, you're looking at a young nigga that got money
And this is what it look like, pussy nigga, to have money
Bitch, you're looking at a young nigga that got money
And this is what it look like, pussy nigga, to have money
Bitch, you're looking at a young nigga that got money
And this is what it look like, pussy nigga, to have money
Bitch, you're looking at a young nigga that got money
And this is what it look like, pussy nigga, to have money

[Verse 1]
Y'all ain't let me, nigga, I'll Deebo up my way in this bitch
And I'ma thug it till I die, fuck that other shit
If I get killed, nigga, bury me in the projects
334 [?] Court, where I was raised at
Nigga, [?] 4-5, Lee County representer
'Cause I got money, don't mean I won't rob one of you pussy niggas
'Cause a lot of you fuck niggas wanna see me go broke
If that happen, I'm just gon' rob full time, bro
'Cause I'm surviving in a city where most niggas can't
And on the real, I'm gon' make it, the rest of you pussies ain't
You ain't never seen a young nigga get this much respect
That's why I hang wherever the fuck I wanna hang at
And I ain't worrying about you niggas 'cause I got bond money
So all the shit y'all niggas talking 'bout, I ain't stunting
And bruh just dropped 60 G's on me, it ain't no secret
I turned around and gave that 60 to the Cuban people

[Chorus]
Bitch, you're looking at a young nigga that got money
And this is what it look like, pussy nigga, to have money
Bitch, you're looking at a young nigga that got money
And this is what it look like, pussy nigga, to have money
Bitch, you're looking at a young nigga that got money
And this is what it look like, pussy nigga, to have money
Bitch, you're looking at a young nigga that got money
And this is what it look like, pussy nigga, to have money

[Verse 2]
I look better in a Chevy, I don't want a Benz
Plus I need something with a little room to put them K's in
'Cause y'all listening to a nigga that the streets made
I'm giving it to you gutter, nigga, I don't know no other way
And niggas in prison say my name all over the compound
And niggas betting their whole commissary on Plies
I'ma be the first nigga to blow and bond all my niggas out
And when I bond them out, I'm getting all of them their dope house
I'm one of few niggas that had money before I got in the music game
And I'm a celebrity in the hood, nigga, with ghetto fame
You feel you know a nigga rawer than me? Well, put up 36
And for you lames who don't know, nigga, that's a whole brick
And if you ain't got it like that, then put up a pack, bitch
And I'll match your pack, pussy nigga, with 36

[Interlude]
Yeah, y'all niggas got me all the way out of here, nigga
Slip-n-Slide Records
Fuck you, nigga

[Chorus]
Bitch, you're looking at a young nigga that got money
And this is what it look like, pussy nigga, to have money
Bitch, you're looking at a young nigga that got money
And this is what it look like, pussy nigga, to have money
Bitch, you're looking at a young nigga that got money
And this is what it look like, pussy nigga, to have money
Bitch, you're looking at a young nigga that got money
And this is what it look like, pussy nigga, to have money

[Outro]
Y'all fuck niggas thought I was dead, nigga?
Like I told y'all niggas, boy
Every time y'all niggas see me, I'm slamming it
And for y'all niggas that don't know what "slamming it" means, nigga
That's spending cash, nigga
Ay, and y'all niggas can't figure out if it's dope money or rap money
And that's a beautiful thing
Y'all fuck niggas tell them crackers that, old pussy ass nigga
