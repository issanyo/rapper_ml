Chorus:
Her pussy got low miles
Her pussy got low miles
Her pussy got low miles
Pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Her pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Her pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
I fuck her like that
Cause she ain't fucking like that!

Vers 1:
Her wall stay tight ,so I can still hit the bottom
Have the hole lil ass down, when I hit the throttle
She ain't fucking a super heavy, so she got that water
She won't fuck with a lot of niggas, so that's why I call her
She really fucking nothin', that pussy I break it in
Long miles on the shit, if I went through shit I can skim
That pussy she keep it up, gotta ask her by where I've been
How many niggas fuck, she could count that shit on a hand
Low miles go the shit, that mean I can either then
Low miles go the shit, that means she ain't gotta sin
Can't fuck her with one claw, got opened the [?]
I want my [?]

[Hook: x2]
Pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Her pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Her pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
I fuck her like that
Cause she ain't fucking like that!

Vers 2:

Anything is still in place ,owe it just like it's new
She got a platinum plus pussy, so it's just like she blue
Be trying to stick to her ass super like I'm the glue
I'll be sucking and blowingon her just like she's the soup
Got the shit all together, she's super clean, plus she's cute
She on the 2Pac shit ain't her?, cause she got the Juice
[?] ain't nothing to lose
And I'll be doing her ass up everytime I come through
And when she get on top, I tell her hit the switches for me boo
And when she turn up I love it, I call it my lil crew
But when she run out gas, that's when I do what I do
And when I paint it she love it, that's how I know I'm the truth
But when last one go shake it ,I know she almost through
And when that swag go to dripping, that's when have (had?) come loose
And when she stare at the ceiling, smiling that she can't move
That's when I whisper and tell her, damn, you ran out of truth!

[Hook: x2]
Pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Her pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Her pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
Pussy got low miles, low
I fuck her like that
Cause she ain't fucking like that!
