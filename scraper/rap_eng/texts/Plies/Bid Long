[Intro]
Ay, dog
This one here for all my motherfucking niggas that's locked up, dog
All my niggas who bidding in prison, my nigga
A lot of niggas forgot about you, but I ain't forgot about you

[Chorus]
I got some niggas in prison that ain't coming home
And they main hoe done put a block on the phone
And all the niggas they was running with done left him 'lone
Motherfuckers forget about you when your bid long

[Verse 1]
What can a young nigga at 19 do with 40 years?
Not a motherfucking thing but hope for an appeal
Them crackers giving niggas more time then they done lived
And where I'm from, these crackers hiding niggas at the crib
I asked my homeboy, "How in the fuck you do 40?"
He told me, 'You just do it, you don't think about it'
Them crackers don't sell liqour in prison, you gotta think bout it
But like he told me, time ain't the thing that hurt the most
The motherfuckers that forget 'bout you that you thought was close
If he had to do it all again, he wouldn't even take it to da door
I told him, he ain't got to tell me 'cause I already know
He thought he had himself some soldiers on the front row
But like I told him, dog, you ain't breaking bread no more
In these streets, dog, that's all a bitch care for
The real niggas in these streets are at an all time low
And these hoes and homeboys ain't riding no moe

[Chorus]
I got some niggas in prison that ain't coming home
And they main hoe done put a block on the phone
And all the niggas they was running with done left him 'lone
Motherfuckers forget about you when your bid long
[Chorus]
I got some niggas in prison that ain't coming home
And they main hoe done put a block on the phone
And all the niggas they was running with done left him 'lone
Motherfuckers forget about you when your bid long

[Verse 2]
Nobody care about you when you ain't got shit to give
But when you got it, they love you while you're out of here
They was my niggas when they was out and they my niggas now
Right now, they need me the most, so I got to help em out
I turn my back on them, that mean I'm the pussy nigga, then
And me being flaw is something that I don't believe in
There's niggas everyday that's getting lost in the system
The fucked up part about it: don't nobody miss them
My own brother can't even tell me where the crackers shipped him
Told me that with a straight face and kept dipping
I'm looking at dog, like, man this pussy nigga tripping
Your own brother, you can't tell me where the crackers shipped him?
Love don't love nobody, the streets fucked up
That's why I pray every day that I don't get jammed up
To be honest with you, I'm scared to find out what's what
The ones that let you down are the ones you loved so much

[Chorus]
I got some niggas in prison that ain't coming home
And they main hoe done put a block on the phone
And all the niggas they was running with done left him 'lone
Motherfuckers forget about you when your bid long
[Chorus]
I got some niggas in prison that ain't coming home
And they main hoe done put a block on the phone
And all the niggas they was running with done left him 'lone
Motherfuckers forget about you when your bid long

[Verse 3]
What happened to niggas accepting a couple of phone calls?
And what happened to niggas sending flicks to they dog?
Your dog down bad right now, go on and break them off
You got to answer his calls for y'all to even talk
It ain't like you can call him, shit, when you wanna talk
Some niggas doing time right now, that ain't they fault
In this world, it's a black law and it's a white law
A street nigga, dog, we don't die of old age
A street nigga, dog, we die one or three ways
We get shot, die in prison, or we die of AIDS
I know it's already written, how I'ma leave here one day
But all the niggas locked up, I pray for you every day

[Chorus]
I got some niggas in prison that ain't coming home
And they main hoe done put a block on the phone
And all the niggas they was running with done left him 'lone
Motherfuckers forget about you when your bid long
[Chorus]
I got some niggas in prison that ain't coming home
And they main hoe done put a block on the phone
And all the niggas they was running with done left him 'lone
Motherfuckers forget about you when your bid long

[Outro]
Ay, dog
It's a lot of good motherfucking niggas locked up, dog
It's a lot of niggas that's locked up
That when they was out of here, my nigga
They took care of a lot of you motherfuckers, man
Made sure a lot of y'all was good, dog
It's a lot of niggas doing time
Because of some of the motherfuckers out here, dog
And now, when a nigga get locked up, man
Y'all can't make sure dog got cantine money?
Y'all can't make sure y'all send dog flicks, man?
Y'all can't accept dog's phone calls, man?
You put a block on the phone 'cause you fucking anotha nigga, man?
Dog, keep it real with yourself, homie
If dog looked out for you and took care of you, my nigga
For 2, 3 years while you was out of here, dog
The least you can do is take care of dog for 2 or 3 years, dog
