We got jammed outa town car full of choppers
You looked me in my eyes and told me you would take the charges
Told you if we goin down we goin down together regardless
We always said we gunna leave this bitch how we started
As long as we got eachotha well fuck errybody
The love we got fo eachother it remain flawless
Ain't no money ain't no ho in the world can spoil it
The niggas that turned on us priss but they werent tought it
If poems are real nigga you taught me how to shout it
Bein real is a blessin most niggas ain't got it
And why you fuck niggas mad at us we can't call it
When we die we want you to put us in the same coffin

You da realist fuckin nigga I done met eva
To be your lil brotha dog is ma fuckin pleasure
What you stand for ma nigga it can't be measured
I love you so fuckin much bra I hope we die together
You da realist fuckin nigga I done met eva
To be your lil brotha dog is ma fuckin pleasure
What you stand for ma nigga it can't be measured
I love you so fuckin much bra I hope we die together
