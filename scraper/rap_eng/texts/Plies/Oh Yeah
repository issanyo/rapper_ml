[Chorus: Chris Brown & (DJ Scream)]
I'll be putting it down in a minute
How long will it take before you screaming my name? Oh, baby (No Chaser world premiere)
We should rip off our clothes and get naked (Plies)
I'll be like, "Oh, yeah," you'll be like, "Oh, yeah" (Hood Rich)
Hot enough up in here making us sweat
Your little pedicure up on my chest (we doin' a number one bill for 'em with this one)
And we gon' sweat, sweat, sweat
I'll be like, "Oh, yeah," you'll be like, "Oh, yeah, making us sweat (tell 'em DJ Scream sent that)

[Interlude: DJ Scream]
DJ Scream, hear it in the streets

[Verse 1: Plies]
What's my biggest turn on in a woman? One that's flexible
I'm talkin' her limbs, I ain't talkin' 'bout her schedule
If you ain't, it's still cool, baby, I can work with ya
I been doin' it a long time, I bring out the best in ya
Bring you to your front door, drop off like a messenger
Earrings real long, I go hard like a Mexican
First two pumps, shawty, that's what's at the precedent
Kiss you on your vo-jay-jay, bring ya out your element
Last one I ran crazy, she got it with the peppermint
She was out the hood though, the moan with a accent
Showed her somethin' she never seen, hit her with the backspin
She say that I'm X-rated, I say that I'm confident
Seen her with her boots on, make me want it right then
I know she got that repeat, she turn me on in long pants
Told me, boy, you know what's good? I reply with Amen
Late night plus liquor, she knows equals long, we gone

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'll be putting it down in a minute
How long will it take before you screaming my name? Oh, baby
We should rip off our clothes and get naked
I'll be like, "Oh, yeah," you'll be like, "Oh, yeah"
Hot enough up in here making us sweat
Your little pedicure up on my chest
And we gon' sweat, sweat, sweat
I'll be like, "Oh, yeah," you'll be like, "Oh, yeah," making us sweat

[Verse 2: Plies]
I done got up off the high speed, I like it when it's slow
I be wantin' the lights on, she be wantin' 'em off
She be tryna hold it in but I be wantin' to talk (ha!)
She be hollerin' put it on, I be hollerin' nope
Them two T's on, I'm talkin' red velvet soft
Interior real deal, duckin' high moss
I always tell her, "Baby, act like I gotta go to court
Act like this the last time I'm walkin' through your door"
I be like super-hyped, she don't even know
She be wantin' to go to sleep but I don't even wanna go
I be on the couch, even eyes wide open
I'm actin' like a Don King, hollerin' round 4

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'll be putting it down in a minute
How long will it take before you screaming my name? Oh, baby
We should rip off our clothes and get naked
I'll be like, "Oh, yeah," you'll be like, "Oh, yeah"
Hot enough up in here making us sweat
Your little pedicure up on my chest
And we gon' sweat, sweat, sweat
I'll be like, "Oh, yeah," you'll be like, "Oh, yeah," making us sweat

[Verse 3: Plies]
Ain't even gon' lie to you, I text her everyday
I'ma tell ya how I talk to her's everythin' bae
She ask me am I'm comin' over? I say, "Yeah, bae"
She ask me am I hungry? I tell her, "Yeah, bae"
She ask me do I want it? I say, "Hell yeah, babe"
Even when I'm mad at her, she still my little bae
I just sent her a text told her, "Bae, I'm on my way"
She asked me what we finna do? I say, "Give it to bae"

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'll be putting it down in a minute
How long will it take before you screaming my name? Oh, baby
We should rip off our clothes and get naked
I'll be like, "Oh, yeah," you'll be like, "Oh, yeah"
Hot enough up in here making us sweat
Your little pedicure up on my chest
And we gon' sweat, sweat, sweat
I'll be like, "Oh, yeah," you'll be like, "Oh, yeah," making us sweat
