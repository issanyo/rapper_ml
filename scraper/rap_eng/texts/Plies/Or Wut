[Verse 1: T-Pain]
We just Netflix and chillin' up in your apartment
You got on them shorts that you got from your college, alright
But I'm so focused right now
You know just what I'm tryna do
We was watchin' a movie
But now that bitch watchin' me watchin' you
Tell your roommate to stop being nosy
Cause me and you about to get cosy
You say you a freak, well, then show me
But I'm telling you girl, take it slowly

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Cause this ain't, this ain't what you used to, you used to
And I got some of that good music for you to get loose to
Kissin' just ain't enough, you know what's up
Got my hands all over your butt

[Hook: T-Pain]
Shawty, you gone let a nigga fuck or what?
I'm just being 100, yeah
You actin' like you don't wanna bust this nut
Are you tryin' to run from me?
Shawty, you gone let a nigga fuck or what?
I'm just being 100, yeah
You actin' like you don't wanna bust this nut
Are you tryin' to run from me?

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Now I got you buttnaked on top of this carpet
You want it as bad as I do, so don't stop it
Girl, what's happening right now?
Tell your roommate get back in the room
Cause we was just watching a movie
Now she can see me on top of you
When she want to come in get to know me
Then all three of us can get cosy
You said you a freak, girl, then show me
But I'm telling you girl, take it slowly

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Cause this ain't, this ain't what you used to, you used to
And I got some of that good music for you to get loose to
Kissin' just ain't enough, you know what's up
Got my hands all over your butt

[Hook: T-Pain]
Shawty, you gone let a nigga fuck or what?
I'm just being 100, yeah
You actin' like you don't wanna bust this nut
Are you tryin' to run from me?
Shawty, you gone let a nigga fuck or what?
I'm just being 100, yeah
You actin' like you don't wanna bust this nut
Are you tryin' to run from me?

[Verse 3: Plies]
You ain't even gotta take 'em all the way off
You can just pull your little thing to the side
I ain't even 'bout to go lie to you beauty
Pussy good like Patti LaBelle sweet potatoe pie
I don't wanna hit you from the body one time
I be wanna eat you with the ice one time
I be wanna get out that thing
Go to dance like Drizzy did in the video Hotline
Stretch marks on your little ass like a tire
Don't you answer, bitch, let's play tired
Do big balls bitch, I be here for the same
Had to strike one word with you, go let it snow
Let me dab in the pussy like the damn Migo
Let me turn the lights on like my dawg Rico
Make me Quan, yeah, like Rich Homie tho
I don't get tired of you, I'm on a [?] flow?

[Hook: T-Pain]
Shawty, you gone let a nigga fuck or what?
I'm just being 100, yeah
You actin' like you don't wanna bust this nut
Are you tryin' to run from me?
Shawty, you gone let a nigga fuck or what?
I'm just being 100, yeah
You actin' like you don't wanna bust this nut
Are you tryin' to run from me?

[Outro: T-Pain]
Shawty, you gone let a nigga fuck or what?
