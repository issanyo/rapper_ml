[Chorus]
All your girls excited
Ooh, you know they like it
I'm a dope boy
A dope boy
Girl, don't try and fight it
All your friends, they like it
I'm a dope boy
A dope boy

[Verse 1: Plies]
It's amazing, nigga, what a couple of ounces will do
If you don't believe in the dope game, I'm living proof
This shit will take you from nothing to brand new
If you ain't a street nigga, then you ain't got a clue
I ain't telling you to be a dope boy, nigga, go and do what you do
But in the hood, who all the bad hoes flock to?
I bet a D-boy in your city got it locked, too
You might not like a dope boy, but I bet you like his car
And you don't like him 'cause your man can't buy the bar
We might not be on TV, but we ghetto superstars
And if you're tired of struggling, get you a dope boy
Remember, I told you, there ain't nothing like a dope boy

[Chorus]
All your girls excited
Ooh, you know they like it
I'm a dope boy
A dope boy
Girl, don't try and fight it
All your friends, they like it
I'm a dope boy
A dope boy

[Verse 2: Plies]
This one here for all my niggas in the dope hole
And for that nigga in the kitchen whipping over the stove
And for them niggas [?] saying five-O
I'm tired of y'all niggas telling me the dope game ain't what it used to be
The problem is, y'all fuck niggas ain't what y'all used to be
The same one I done hit now when y'all was in the streets
Imagine if you took the dope boys out the city
Either y'all hoes would pack they shit up and move out the city
Without the dope boy, four miles wouldn't be a city
And this one for the dope boys, cracker, deal with it
The dope boys showed you how it looked on 24's
And how to put the dust in your reefer and not your nose
They might ain't showed y'all niggas how to get money
But they showed y'all niggas what it looked like to have money
Clean money and dope money ain't the same money
Clean money got a cap and a limit on it
Dope money "spend it however you want it" money
And get back in the dope hole 'cause it's still coming
And whatever you wanna do, nigga, I got a grand on it
The dope boys the niggas that invented stunting

[Chorus]
All your girls excited
Ooh, you know they like it
I'm a dope boy
A dope boy
Girl, don't try and fight it
All your friends, they like it
I'm a dope boy
A dope boy

[Bridge]
I'm a dope boy, I'm a dope boy
I'm a dope boy, I'm a dope boy

[Chorus]
All your girls excited
Ooh, you know they like it
I'm a dope boy
A dope boy
Girl, don't try and fight it
All your friends, they like it
I'm a dope boy
A dope boy
