[Intro]
This ain't nothing but a headache

[Chorus: (x4)]
Bitch you a headache
Gimme a headache
You nothin' but a head ache
Come with headaches

[Verse 1: Plies]
You get on my nerves
Just let me live
All that negative energy
I ain't tryna hear it
Im tryna live good
Tryna get fat
You tryna argue
Im tryna get racks
Im tryna elevate
You tryna keep me here
Ain't tryna lose no more
Im tryna eat this year
You tryna help me lose
Or you tryna help me win
I ain't got time for drama
Im tryna get these ends
I want a bigger bag [?]
I wanna [?]
I want the Maybach Excelero
Put it on some feet
If you ain't blessing me
Then you stressing me
If you ain't tryna help me win
I don't want you next to me

[Chorus: (x4)]

[Verse 2: Plies]
Ain't mad at no body
Tryna be stress free
Ain't worried bout the next
Im worried bout me
I like to live good
I gotta chase this shit
I like to drive foreign's
I gotta hustle bih
I can't be mad bro
I like the Hasbro
I like the finer things
You do the math bro
Ain't tryna die and be local
Im tryna see the world
Im tryna ball forever
Got time for problems girl
Too much money to get
Too many mouths to feed
Too many places to go
Too many people to see
If they ain't pushing you forward
Then they just slowing you down
If they ain't helping you win
Why the fuck are they around?

[Chorus: (x4)]

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
(fall back, fall back...fall the fuck back)
You gimme migranes
You got some fire brain tho
You do what i say
You dont run no darn thing ho
You do what i say so
Whatever i say go
You ain't special you get dealt
Ain't no problem playing ho
Know i got the fans
Got on nine diamond chains
And they glowin'
That lil razzle so annoyin'
I popped off on a Ibuprofen
I caught her hidin' behind my neighbor house
Behind the car lurking
I be geeked up i be jerking
I dont do that shit on purpose
She overdosing on the perkies
But i dont think its working
She overdosing on the perkies
Now she got me worried
Can't believe
These niggas be telling these
Lil bitches everything
Get next to me
To try to understand a G
So you could to tell on me
(Fall back, fall back, lil dike, fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back)

[Chorus: (x4)]
