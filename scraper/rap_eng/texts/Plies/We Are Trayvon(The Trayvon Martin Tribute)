Hey Trayvon, Trayvon, I know you up in heaven right now walking on gold, Lil bro. (Know you’re walking on gold lil bro)
And I know you so proud how strong your family is, I just wanna tell you something lil bro

Chorus:
You’ll forever live on, forever live on
You’ll forever live on, forever live on
You’ll forever live on, you’ll forever live on
You’ll forever live on, you’ll forever live on

Verse 1:
I never thought that wearing no hoodie, could cost you your life
And I never thought you could just kill somebody and go out the same night. (same night)
Every dog that you see that bark, don’t mean that he bite
And everything that’s black ain’t even, everything that’s pure ain’t white
Cause you think that I’m doin wrong don’t mean that you right. (you right)
Cause the ones that you think that won’t, them the ones that might. (that might)
Some people in this world the system don’t like
When you living what you worth is how they value your life
I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me
And even when I pray, I pray for my enemy
And Pac said it best “only God can judge me.”
Trayvon I want you to know lil homie, you really touched me

Chorus:
You’ll forever live on, forever live on
You’ll forever live on, forever live on
You’ll forever live on, you’ll forever live on
You’ll forever live on, you’ll forever live on

Verse 2:
Sometimes trying to live right, sometimes seems so wrong
Sometimes you tryin to get justice, sometimes it take so long
But the ones they supposed to keep in be the ones they let go home
But the ones that hustlin' to survive be the ones they hold with no bond
My son supposed to bury me, but I ain’t supposed to bury my son
You can call me 'nigga' all you want, but you ain’t supposed to treat me like one
Supposed to be able to express my self, and be able to dress how I want
Supposed to be able to go where I please, and be able to leave when I’m done
Should I think that you sell dope, just cause you drive a Benz?
Should I think that zack in a gang, just cause he sag his pants?
What’s right is right, whats wrong is wrong
Trayvon Martin, you’ll forever live on

Chorus:
You’ll forever live on, forever live on
You’ll forever live on, forever live on
You’ll forever live on, you’ll forever live on
You’ll forever live on, you’ll forever live on

Hey Trayvon, I heard you a little beast on that football field too
(I heard you was a beast with it now.)
But now you get to play on a gold football field lil home (all gold.)
With a solid gold football (solid gold)
With wings on your back
Yeah!
I know they can't see you now lil homie
I know they can’t

But I just wanna let you know (let you know)
You'll forever live on, homie

Chorus:
You’ll forever live on, forever live on
You’ll forever live on, forever live on
You’ll forever live on, you’ll forever live on
You’ll forever live on, you’ll forever live on
