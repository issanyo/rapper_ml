[Chorus]
Keep talking, dog, gon' make me rob your pussy ass
Gonna whack you, fuck nigga, I only want your cash
You lamer than a bitch, old soft ass
Keep talking, you gon' make me rob your pussy ass

[Verse 1]
You're a fuck nigga and everybody know you're flaw
Niggas don't bitched you up a hundred times, you soft
You're a professional talker, all you do is talk
You know how to act like you 'bout it you ain't never got off
Get a couple fuck niggas round you, you try to floss
Nigga catch you by yourself and you act lost
Soon as I catch you flagging, I'ma break you off
And I don't care if it's in the broad day or in the dark

[Chorus]
Keep talking, dog, gon' make me rob your pussy ass
Gonna whack you, fuck nigga, I only want your cash
You lamer than a bitch, old soft ass
Keep talking, you gon' make me rob your pussy ass
Keep talking, dog, gon' make me rob your pussy ass
Gonna whack you, fuck nigga, I only want your cash
You lamer than a bitch, old soft ass
Keep talking, you gon' make me rob your pussy ass

[Verse 2]
It don't take a nigga shit to jump in that monkey suit
And drop that ski down and make that chopper do what it do
You see a nigga jogging with them cannons, don't act stupid
You fuck around and panic and buck if you want to
And I'ma let all one hundred of these hollow points loose
'Cause real goons don't talk, real goons shoot
Keep running, I'ma bust your motherfucking head
Since you wanna play like you're thugging, I'ma make you wet
And fill your little soft pussy ass up with lead
You don't even hang out late night, pussy, you scared
But you get 'round them hoes and try to talk big
You just one fuck nigga, dog, I gotta get

[Chorus]
Keep talking, dog, gon' make me rob your pussy ass
Gonna whack you, fuck nigga, I only want your cash
You lamer than a bitch, old soft ass
Keep talking, you gon' make me rob your pussy ass
Keep talking, dog, gon' make me rob your pussy ass
Gonna whack you, fuck nigga, I only want your cash
You lamer than a bitch, old soft ass
Keep talking, you gon' make me rob your pussy ass

[Verse 3]
Old pussy ass nigga, dog, you ain't supposed to be out here
You're supposed to be on the porch where you been the last ten years
You think you is, nigga, but you ain't in the clear
Make you think shit sweet to get you out here
As soon as you think shit gravy, get your ass flipped
I'm trying to put you in the newspaper off the rip
That faking like you tough done got a lot of niggas killed
And how the fuck niggas be the ones with the most lip
You wanna be 'bout it, dog, but that ain't how you're built
Niggas slapped you with the pistol, dog, and you dipped
You pie, dog, me and you ain't cut from the same quilt
It ain't gon' take nothing but one time for you to slip
And I'ma max your ass out with the whole clip
I wanna run down on you when you're with your dogs
Burn rubber on your ass and give it to all of y'all
Y'all already know what I'm 'bout, you know how I'm rocking, dog

[Chorus]
Keep talking, dog, gon' make me rob your pussy ass
Gonna whack you, fuck nigga, I only want your cash
You lamer than a bitch, old soft ass
Keep talking, you gon' make me rob your pussy ass
Keep talking, dog, gon' make me rob your pussy ass
Gonna whack you, fuck nigga, I only want your cash
You lamer than a bitch, old soft ass
Keep talking, you gon' make me rob your pussy ass
