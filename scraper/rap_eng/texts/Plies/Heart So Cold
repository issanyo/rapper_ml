[Hook: Plies]

Wonder why his heart cold
Wonder why his heart cold
Wonder why his heart so cold
X2

[Verse 1: Plies]

Young nigga, been through everything
Right there when the Fed came
Ain’t shit that he ain’t seen
He ain’t do it, but his clique changed
Fell out with niggas ‘bout his own change
Slimy hoes did the same thing
He don’t trust them and he ain’t mane
He don’t fuck with you if he know you green
Family too, them bitches scheme
Did favors, they ain’t come clean
On principles, he stand-ing
Head first, ‘bout his own team
Fuck a bitch, he do his own thing
They ain’t real as they fuckin’ claim
Tired of niggas tryin’ to sell him dreams
His heart cold? What the fuck you mean?

[Hook: Plies]

Wonder why his heart cold
Wonder why his heart cold
Wonder why his heart so cold

[Verse 2: Plies]

He ain’t wrong, he got trust issues
Learned a lot from these fuck niggas
Good times, they ball with you
Bad times, they don’t fuck with you
In the pen, they don’t know a nigga
Now he get it, he see the big picture
Tell them no, then they straight diss you
Ain’t shit though, but made him realer
He got big nuts, but they made them bigger
Young nigga, run of the litter
Last ho was a gold digger
Knowed that before he first hit her
One fo’ them and these hoes gone
Showed love to that bitch’s son
Caught his time and she wass paid to come
But he ain’t stressed, oh it wasn’t nothin’
Ain’t shit!

[Hook: Plies]

Wonder why his heart cold
Wonder why his heart cold
Wonder why his heart so cold

[Verse 3: Plies]

He don’t care cause he out here
Loose lips, they sink ships
Bitch niggas get long clips
He ain’t friendly, that’s all for real
When he was, it cost him
If they ain’t concrete, it’s on them
His attitude like Soulja Slim
And you don’t know where the fuck he’s been
All the people he trusted in
All the times he back slid
Talked about by his own kin
Played close by his own friends
On point, ten out of ten
Staying sane the best way he can
Talked to God about his own sins
And his favorite song’s “Hardest of many men”[?]
