[Chorus T-Pain]
I said shawty got that wet(wet wet wet wet wet)
I said shawty got that wet (wet wet wet wet wet)
I said shawty got that wet (wet wet wet wet wet)
And she drippin’ like a shower, we can get it in for hours
I said shawty got that wet (wet)
I said shawty got that wet (wet)
I said shawty got that wet (wet)
And she drippin’ like a shower, we can get it in for hours
Shawty got that wet

[Verse 1]
Got my Beyonce you just you and I love it, bae
The world knew how good that thang you got down there they probably wanna be you, bae
That thang so good I swear have me moon walking around that thang like I was MJ
Just had a dream about fishes
Probably mean imma blow you up one day
Bae, I love your baby, face but in the streets you be having that poker face
The way you be killing these bitches round here I swear to God they gon give your ass a murder case
A message for you dirty foots before you come for bae you better pump your brakes
Cuh’ just know one thing, anytime you see bae just know it’s a real bih holiday
You love when I call her wet ’n’ wild
When she send me that text it’s gone go down
Got her birthday suit, I’m in heaven now
I’m on this drank so you can’t tell me nothing now
Aquafina flowin’
Figi at it’s best
All I can tell ya is

[Chorus T-Pain]
I said shawty got that wet(wet wet wet wet wet)
I said shawty got that wet (wet wet wet wet wet)
I said shawty got that wet (wet wet wet wet wet)
And she drippin’ like a shower, we can get it in for hours
I said shawty got that wet (wet)
I said shawty got that wet (wet)
I said shawty got that wet (wet)
And she drippin’ like a shower, we can get it in for hours
Shawty got that wet

[Verse 2]
Anybody that get some of that, I know gon cuff you
Anybody run cross you I know gon’ love ya
One thing I can say you know how to use them muscles
Other thing I can say is, bae, I love yo hustle
Baby, I believe in you
Every other day I be needed you
Call me right now, Imma pick up the phone you already know what imma say (fall through)
Baby, you know you got a snapper
I ain’t got to tell you that one
This yo ship and you the captain
You shit ain’t gold it’s platinum
I mean that with a passion
They tell you ain’t different they just rappin’
If this was track, bih you be the lapper
Pain, tell her what she got exactly

[Chorus T-Pain]
I said shawty got that wet(wet wet wet wet wet)
I said shawty got that wet (wet wet wet wet wet)

And she drippin’ like a shower, we can get it in for hours

I said shawty got that wet (wet)
I said shawty got that wet (wet)
And she drippin’ like a shower, we can get it in for hours
Shawty got that wet
