[Intro]
Crazy as fuck ho
Bitch you got some issues
Bitch you got some issues for real

[Hook]
Bitch you got some issues (Bitch you got some issues)
When you was young yo momma dropped you on yo head ho cuz
Bitch you got some issues (Bitch you got some issues)
If I didn’t mean it, then I wouldn’t even say it ho but
Bitch you got some issues (Bitch you got some issues)
When you was young yo momma dropped you on yo head ho cuz
Bitch you got some issues (Bitch you got some issues)
Bitch you got some issues (Bitch you got some issues)

[Verse 1]
One minute bitches snappin’, next minute she gravy
One minute bitch I’m cool with it, next minute she hate me
One minute you a killa, next minute you cryin’
One minute you don’t fuck with me, next minute you ridin’
I don’t give a damn what you do, Just gon’ make up yo mind
Bitch I know you ain’t wrapped tight, you owe me too many times
Put words in my mouth, then you switch it up on me
Nigga catch you in a lie, then you change it up on me
You got a hundred different personalities, who are you today
You might think you got em all dawg, but bitch you ain’t okay
I don’t even know who I be talkin’, to half of the time
You like a Rubik’s Cube ho, you got too many sides

[Hook]


[Verse 2]
If you find something happens, it’s always someone else’s fault
Like to say shit sometimes, just to hear yourself talk
But everybody keep it real, but you don’t do shit that you say
You always acting like you right, bitch and that ain’t the case
Like my Auntie used to say, bitch your bread ain’t done
You gonna fuck up everything, bitch and then play dumb
Like to argue and talk loud, and you dead ass wrong
You confused ho, ‘cause you don’t even know what side you on
The best thing to do, is stay the fuck out my face
Give me 50 feet ho, that mean stay out my space
Better find you somebody to play with, ‘cause I ain’t even for it
Need to cuss yo ass out dawg, before I even know it

[Hook]
