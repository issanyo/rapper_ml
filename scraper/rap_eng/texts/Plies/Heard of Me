[Intro]
Not a typical nigga bruh
(Have you heard of me?)
Boy I think I'm fin' to go all the way on this one
(Have you heard of me?)
One thing about me homeboy (have you heard of me?)
I don't play no motherfuckin games (have you heard of me?)
You better understand me player

[Hook]
May never see me on tha cover of a magazine
Cause I ain't willin to kiss ass and be seen
Corperate mad at me cause they can't fuck me
I'm who these haters hatin, I'm to third degree
They say I'm too gutter, homey for TV
I'm who these white folks, don't want they kids to see
But I'm the new owner, of these fuckin streets
Go by the name of Plies, have you heard of me?

[Plies]
Kept it motherfuckin gutter from day one
Right now homey the streets what I run
How am I this hot and a award I ain't won?
Cause I ain't a industry nigga, alright son?
But you will pay me for what I've done
Keep the industry relationship cause I don't want none
Don't want the fame of this shit, you can have it huh
Shoulda have just took the money, and then run
That ain't how a real nigga play it where I'm from
Stay and get the whole thang, and then some
I done sold gold, what's next platinum
And dold over a million records; ain't that somethin?

[Hook]

[Plies]
Nigga since me e'rybody claimin real
Most you niggas pussy, that's how I feel
To be the best rapper, you gotta tell lies
So I couldn't be that, cause I don't fantasize
How you cookin dope? You wearin suit and ties
This industry a joke, choose who they publicize
Just don't go to your parties you don't fuck with Plies
To all my fans, I apologize
They want me to cross over, but fuck that side
I'm just a real nigga, out of Ft. Meyers
I got principles nigga, that's what I live by
Ain't had a rap feature, and I'm still alive
Not one, my third album, is you suprised?
Worth my investment, ask {*censored*}
Ask Atlantic Records, do I let shit slide?
Ring tone numbers, one point five

[Hook]

[Plies]
Corperate scared of me, cause I ain't safe
They don't know what the fuck that I might say
In the type of game, that they play
I don't wear tight jeans, and I don't rock shades
I'mma trendsetter, I go my own way
I that artist on the radio that the streets praise
You can stop countin on questions Eazy
Ever heard of a nigga that say fuck me?
Nigga either a rapper or he wanna be
Just want me to kill 'em dog, on GP
Say I ain't lyrical, well I'm sorry B
Dropped out of college, ain't earned my degree
But at my bank, they love me~!
His favorite rapper ain't hot, he mad at me
I can make him hot for a small fee
The streets don't want him, I'm sorry

[Hook]
