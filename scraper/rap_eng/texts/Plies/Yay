[Hook: Plies]
You know I got that yay
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay
You know I got that yay
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay
You know I got that yay

[Verse 1: Plies]
All white pigeons, keep 'em in the coop
27/5, let them bitches loose
Strap 'em down good, then jump on the gator
Wanna see a lock up, hit that bitch with that Baking (Soda)
Sprinkle it on the green, that'll get you a cam
Eighteen-hundred flat, that'll get you them yam
Flexin' with the work, that'll get your jam
Fumblin with the yay, that'll get you bammed

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Xtra]
I just left out the store, just bought me a scale
Just got a couple of them thangs' and they just came in the mail
Rap 'em in a bounty, that's gon' hard to smell
When the yay A1, it's gon' sell itself
Everything must go, everything for sale
I don't trust these niggas, cause they don't trust they self
All white teeth, I'm matching with the yay
One in the hand & on my hip and bitch that's everyday

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

[Plies]
I'mma rob a nigga, tryin' to sell me some re-rock
Kept me in the kitchen, bitch I'm working two pots
Bitch I'm riding three deep, tell me nigga 2 Glock
Bitch they ain't gotta think about it, I told that ho to do so

[Xtra]
Bruh I almost shot me a nigga, thought I've seen them clutching
You know I keep that big five, I ain't got time for the fuckery
I just had me a sale, I fucked ? cause a nigga them police
Niggas asking too many questions
I ain't know that shit, boy you know me

[Hook]
