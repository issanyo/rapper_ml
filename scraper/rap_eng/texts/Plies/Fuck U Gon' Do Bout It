[Intro: Plies]
I don't know bruh, I don't know
For some reason tonight I feel like
I can do what the fuck I wanna do

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Yeahhh~! I'm drunk plus I'm vibin
Pistol in my pocket and I'm wildin
Got all my jewelry on, I'm clownin
Nigga, what the fuck you gon' do about it?

[Plies]
Got money, I can buy bottles
Keep one in the head this big fourty
Take somethin from me, I'm gon' off 'em
Fuckin with me, it's gon' cost 'em
No no, I ain't on blue dolphins
Yeah yeah, the 'gnac got me talkin
Big 'gar in my mouth keep me coughin
All this cash keep me flossin
Jewelry on, can't keep these hoes off me
Caked up, look how I'm walkin
Fuck nigga, cross me, I'm gon' spark 'em
Made nigga, look how I'm bossin

[Hook]

[Plies]
For a stack - I can get you killed
Real nigga - that's how I'm built
Stop waitin - I do not slip
Flaggin - will get you flipped
Chopper - ain't sold them there
Don't like me - I don't care
Care for what? - I'mma millionaire
Tight jeans - somethin I don't wear
Pistol - can't fit it in there
Fuck niggas - somethin I don't spare
Pussy - smell 'em in the air
Stay strapped - go anywhere

[Hook]

[Plies]
Yeah nigga I am him
No, I don't fuck with dem
Rob me, naw, that's slim
Goons, I got plenty them
Fourty, knock off yo' limbs
Head shots, aimin at yo brim
Fuck them nigga, I don't fear 'em
Kill that nigga when I see 'em
Money, buy one of you nigga
Ridin with fanger on my trigger
Sleep with a hand on my pistol
Made me kill one of you niggas

[Hook]
