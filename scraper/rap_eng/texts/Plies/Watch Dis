[Intro]
Ay bra, I woke up this mornin bra
And I check my stash dawg (check my stash dawg)
And my cash was lookin truly beautiful (truly beautiful)
I think I'm goin out stuntin today (whaaaaat)

[Hook]
Watch dis
Man I can't wait for the summer
I'mma show you how to be a stunna
Watch dis
Pull up in a brand new hummer
Got it like 3 different colors
Watch dis
Stones on my neck and my wrist
Matchin the paint on my whip
Wha-wha-watch this
Take about 3 to the crib
Betcha don't do it like this

Watch dis
Man I can't wait for the summer
I'mma show you how to be a stunna
Watch dis
Pull up in a brand new hummer
Got it like 3 different colors
Watch dis
Stones on my neck and my wrist
Matchin the paint on my whip
Wha-wha-watch this, Watch this

[Verse 1]
I don't feel right, ain't got enough haters
Somebody send me some, so I can aggravate them
You ain't in my league dawg
You ain't got no fuckin paper
I done fucked her
I'mma let you chase her
Yo money ain't right dawg
Better stay yo ass home
I'm in my stunt mode
Better cut yours on
I broke a record throwin money, 20 straight songs
I got my hammer cocked
Put something in my fuckin zone (fuckin zone)
Just let me ask you sumthin, how you gonna rob a goon
Try me if you wanna, be a dead nigga comin soon
Somethin under my shirt (somethin under my shirt)
Will change your attitude
I lay my stunt down, give me some fuckin room

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Well since you brought it up, let's talk about money
That little shit you got, No real came from it
That shit you doin dawg
We call that shit frontin
Ol peon ass nigga, you ain't spent nothin
You niggas round here talkin
It's time to show something
You want it but can't afford it
Then you ain't really stuntin
Check my resume, nigga I'm known for dumpin
Park in front of the club, And left my shit runnin
Jack boys send em please so I can bun em
Touch me if you want, I bet them fuckin goons comin
That carbine 15 will leave yo pussy ass jumpin
Class in session nigga, Watch me and learn somethin

[Hook]

Watch this, this, this
