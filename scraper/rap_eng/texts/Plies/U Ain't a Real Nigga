[Chorus]
You ever snitched or took the stand? (You ain't a real nigga)
You've got to hate on the next man (you ain't a real nigga)
You need a fuck nigga to hold your hand (you ain't a real nigga)
You scared to make that chopper dance (you ain't a real nigga)
You ever snitched or took the stand? (You ain't a real nigga)
You've got to hate on the next man (you ain't a real nigga)
You need a fuck nigga to hold your hand (you ain't a real nigga)
You scared to make that chopper dance (you ain't a real nigga)

[Verse 1]
You can't fool me, I know what a real nigga look like
Been raised up around them, been one all my life
The streets heard me, real niggas gon' take my advice
Then fuck with a nigga nowadays, you rolling the dice
You don't know if a nigga G code or if a nigga sheist
Remember, you ran with certain niggas 'meant you was alright
Now you niggas talk 'round anybody, keep your mouth tight
You ain't certified, pussy, until you earn stripes
But nigga rob you, he ain't killed you, you better rob him back
Or get his shirt from a pussy nigga across the back
'Cause once a pussy, always a pussy, ain't no turning back
There ain't no fuck nigga in me, I put that on stacks

[Chorus]
You ever snitched or took the stand? (You ain't a real nigga)
You've got to hate on the next man (you ain't a real nigga)
You need a fuck nigga to hold your hand (you ain't a real nigga)
You scared to make that chopper dance (you ain't a real nigga)
You ever snitched or took the stand? (You ain't a real nigga)
You've got to hate on the next man (you ain't a real nigga)
You need a fuck nigga to hold your hand (you ain't a real nigga)
You scared to make that chopper dance (you ain't a real nigga)

[Verse 2]
I never understood what made a fuck nigga hate
And tell lies on another nigga and drop weight
How the fuck you hate another nigga 'cause your money ain't straight?
The next nigga's pockets ain't your business in the first place
A real nigga don't hide, real niggas show face
It seems prosecutors make real niggas break
And watch the love of money turn real niggas fake
I choose being real over a mill any day
Ain't nothing real about you, pussy, you just know what to say
You just do what a fuck nigga do, dog, so go on and hate
That Kool-Aid in your heart, nigga, made you turn steak
Now you trying to testify, pussy nigga, it's too late

[Chorus]
You ever snitched or took the stand? (You ain't a real nigga)
You've got to hate on the next man (you ain't a real nigga)
You need a fuck nigga to hold your hand (you ain't a real nigga)
You scared to make that chopper dance (you ain't a real nigga)
You ever snitched or took the stand? (You ain't a real nigga)
You've got to hate on the next man (you ain't a real nigga)
You need a fuck nigga to hold your hand (you ain't a real nigga)
You scared to make that chopper dance (you ain't a real nigga)

[Verse 3]
I'ma let you know something about me, nigga: I'm fuck-nigga proof
It's real or nothing with me, nigga, that's all I'm used to
Show me a real nigga and I'll show you a thousand fuck niggas
That's why I don't speak to you pussy niggas who I know soft in the middle
'Cause once a pussy, always a pussy, learned that off the dribble
You hate another motherfucker 'cause your life miserable
My motherfucking definition of a real nigga
The reason I'm up so hard on you fuck niggas 'cause you had a choice
And I'll forever feel like that, I ain't got no remorse
And I got the recipe to stop you fuck niggas from snitching
I'll bet that motherfucking chopper get you niggas' attention
I'll bet that motherfucking chopper get you niggas' attention

[Chorus]
You ever snitched or took the stand? (You ain't a real nigga)
You've got to hate on the next man (you ain't a real nigga)
You need a fuck nigga to hold your hand (you ain't a real nigga)
You scared to make that chopper dance (you ain't a real nigga)
You ever snitched or took the stand? (You ain't a real nigga)
You've got to hate on the next man (you ain't a real nigga)
You need a fuck nigga to hold your hand (you ain't a real nigga)
You scared to make that chopper dance (you ain't a real nigga)
