Why the real niggas gotta die?
Why do real niggas, why do real niggas gotta die?
Why the real niggas gotta die?
Why the fuck niggas can't die?
Why we can't free the real niggas?
And get the fuck niggas all the time
Why the real niggas gotta die?
Why the fuck niggas can't die?
Why we can't free the real niggas?
And get the fuck niggas all the time

RIP to the fuck niggas, ain't like the niggas in the way
RIP to all the real niggas, I salute you to your grave
Shout out to niggas on the rep, y'all, try to release some of that stress
The land taught you what you know, nigga, you always talk about your J
Don't give a fuck about your ice, nigga, don't give a fuck about your car
'Cause none of that shit make you real, nigga, than keep it reel with your dog

[Chorus:]
Why the real niggas gotta die?
Why the fuck niggas can't die?
Why we can't free the real niggas?
And get the fuck niggas all the time
Why the real niggas gotta die?
Why the fuck niggas can't die?
Why we can't free the real niggas?
And get the fuck niggas all the time

Eerythang called respected, eerythang, eerythang
Another day, another dollar, that's why I ride with this thang
My dawg Jake crossed the frontier, crack'em them shit among the road
Yeah, that's why the nigga stood low
'Cause he won't fuck with one his own
Five days, five bitters, nigga, that what the new paper say
And all my mo'fucking five bodies
A nigga caught one in the head

[Chorus]
My Mr. Dawg, nigga, he been jailed for 8 years
Damned my nigga wife and dog, so I had to see that he got killed
They say this shit is dirty game, nigga
But I'm a play it cut through
I'm glad they came with the crack law
He gave the real niggas loan
It ain't no crying on this scene, nigga
It's all good in the hood
They keep it real with your people
They like a real nigga should
