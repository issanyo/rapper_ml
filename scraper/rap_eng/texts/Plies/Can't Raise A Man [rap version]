[K. Michelle & Plies]
Can't raise a man
Hm
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah ah
Yeah
Listen

[Verse 1]
He got older, but never grew
For his life he can't tell the truth
How to love he ain't got a clue
Playing games like he'll never lose, you
Try to talk to him, can't get through
Every day he's a different dude

[Chorus]
These are the signs of a grown ass boy
Better run for the hills, I'm just trying to keep it real
You can't raise a man, he's already grown, what you gonna do?
You wonder why he acts like a boy
It's 'cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody
If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
'Cause you can't raise a man, no, no

[Verse 2 Plies]
You ain't tryna raise a nigga, baby, you tryna control a nigga (tryna control a nigga)
You give a nigga a lil’ shot of that pussy, you think you own a nigga (think yo own a nigga)
Ease drop no conversation, you ain’t no police is you
A lot of stress, a lot of cryin’, don't bring yo emotions with cha (emotions with cha)
That's half the problem right there, baby, you tryin’ to raise somethin’ (tryin’ to raise somethin’)
Let me buy you a puppy or lil cat, since you wanna raise somethin’ (you wanna raise somethin’)
Instead of tryna find a nigga with money, find a nigga that care ‘bout cha (care ‘bout cha)
And stop lettin' a couple dollars bring the hoe up out cha (hoe up out cha)
Want a nigga to take care of ya and shit, now  who raisin’ you? (who raisin’ who)
Better bring something else to the table, besides being cute (besides being cute)
I agree with K, every word, you can't raise a man (can't raise a man)
But some of you hoes wanna be saved and I can't save ya ass

[Chorus]
Can't raise a man, he's already grown, what you gonna do?
You wonder why he acts like a boy
It's 'cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody
If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
'Cause you can't raise a man, no, no

[Verse 3]
Coming home any time at night
Expecting you to let it ride
How many tears are you gonna cry
Playing games like he'll never lose you ooh
You know that the love is changed
How many times he called you out your name
These are the signs of a grown ass boy
Better run for the hills, I'm just keeping it real

[Bridge]
Cause can't raise a man
He's already grown, what you gonna do
You wonder why he acts like a boy
It's 'cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody
If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
You can't raise a man, no, no
Gonna take more than a miracle (a miracle)
To change him, just let him go (just let him go)
Tell me when will you decide
To do better with your life
If his momma couldn't do it what makes you think
You can train a boy to be a man, it's too late
Better off letting him go
No matter how hard you try you can't raise

[Chorus]
You can't raise a man, he's already grown, what you gonna do yeah
You wonder why he acts like a boy
'Cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody
If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
Can't raise a man, no
Ah ah oh
Ah-ah oh yeah
Ah-ah no
Ah-ah
Can't raise a man
