[Verse 1]

That ho legs off the chain you think that bitch is innocent
That ho legs E&J that bitch is not Remmy
You think that bitch all yours that what you thank
That bitch there been fucking heavy you thank she ain't

He acting like he so in love
But he in love with a slut

And you and her done booed up
In my 2Pac voice ain mad at you

She like you and fuck a fag just like a jackrabbit

You gotta know she ain't shit
