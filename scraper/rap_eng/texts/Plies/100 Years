[Intro]
My nigga e'erytime I think this shit gettin' rough out here
For me my nigga... I just remind myself dog Monday through
Friday homie... From 8 in the mornin' to 5 in the evenin'
Dog... It's some niggas in the court room 'round the country
My nigga... Fightin' for they muhfuckin' lives dog... The
Crackers bannin' niggas e'eryday my nigga

[Verse 1]
My dog went to court today they gave him fifteen
Cracker banned my lil' nigga he was se'enteen
Young nigga don't even know what all that time mean
Pussy ass crackers done shattered my nigga dreams
They holl'in' mandatory they want him to do the whole thang
Nigga showed up in court on my dog and did his thang
Nigga did my nigga now I got to bust his brain
Nigga woulda did me my dog'd do the same
His lady callin' me cryin' and now I feel her pain
Tired of losin' all my niggas to the chain gang
In thirty minutes a nigga whole life can change
Cracker over sinister niggas when this shit gon' change?

[Hook]
Pussy ass cracker give a nigga a hundred years
Have ya mama leavin' out the courtroom in tears
Crackers don't love to have a nigga breathin' for real
Take a nigga life from him they don't know how it feel
Pussy ass cracker give a nigga a hundred years
Have ya mama leavin' out the courtroom in tears
Crackers don't love to have a nigga breathin' for real
Take a nigga life from him they don't know how it feel

[Verse 2]
Ain't talked to my dog yet but I know he sick
Next fifteen years of his life behind a fence
Cracker find a nigga guilty and hit him wit' the bench
Gave one of my dogs twenty-seven on his first offense
The time they givin' the nigga for the crime ain't makin' sense
They jacked the number up now it's eighty-five percent
They did that to make you fuck niggas out here snitch
And put conspiracy in the game to railroad the click
And crackers feel like niggas ain't got no common sense
A nigga paper ain't right they banned him off the rip
A public defender don't get you shit but a long trip
And judge sentencin innocent niggas without a guilt

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
How in the fuck can fo' birds get you a life sentence?
But give a cracker seven years for money launderin' millions
Shoot a nigga in the leg they sentence you like you killed 'em
Cracker catch you wit' that iron and put you under the buildin'
You a nigga that mean you guilty 'til proven innocent
Money talk and bullshit walk a thousand miles
You ain't got a paid lawyer then don't go to trial
Crackers owe each other favors, they'll swap ya out
"You give us him, we'll give you him" know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Nigga took thirty years on a cop out
The fuck you get thirty years for breakin' in a bitch house?
Crackers playin' a dirty game boy this shit wild

[Hook]
