[Intro]
Hey baby 'fore you put yo' clothes back on
I wanna tell you somethin (put yo' clothes back on baby)
You done somethin in yo' life that I ain't never done in my life befo'
And that's fucked a millionaire, ha

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
Damn shorty you hotter than the street light, you wanna get did right
C'mon and get on me, I wanna know what's makin you horny
Come on shorty you hotter than the street light, you wanna get did right
C'mon and get on me, I wanna know what's makin you horny

[Plies]
She never seen me, a day in her life
All she know, my money look right
Young street nigga, flippin on 'gnac
Yes she see the swag, plus she see the ice
Sittin in the Chevy, listenin to the pipes
Passenger seat open, room for a wife
Niggas wish for it, but this is my life
She walk real stank, that's what I like
Jeans stickin to her, pussy lookin right
She get in this whip, it ain't no comin bike
Cause I'm pretty sho', I got what you like
I cain't even front you hotter than the street light

[Hook]

[Plies]
Say she don't fuck with broke niggas I told her me too
My money been straight - what about you?
Cause if you broke I don't need to fuck with you
Bullshit never I make dreams come true
You say your man at work baby what he do?
He answer phones for a livin, ain't that cute
I'm in the streets with mine and he wearin suits
Before he fuck you do he fanger you and eat you?
You got the potential baby to be my boo
In 'bout 30 minutes I can get you to lose
Make you nut twice befo' I shoot
You hotter than the street light, tellin you the truth

[Hook]

[Sean Garrett]
So many nights shorty called me and begged me to come on over
But you know that your nigga's at home
And it's gonna be some shit if I appear
And you know there ain't no fear
So come on baby be for real
If I show up I'mma have to carry on
Ain't gon' stop puttin on
And I'mma have to take it there
As soon as the street lights come on
I'mma come get'cha, get'cha
As soon as the street lights come on
I'mma come see ya, see ya
As soon as the street lights come on
I'mma come get'cha, get'cha
As soon as the street lights come on
I'mma come see ya, see ya

[Hook]
