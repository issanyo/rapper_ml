[Chorus:]
All I need is baking soda
Drop a four in the pot, make an ounce to a rock
Put it to your left
All I need is boilling water
Heavy on the block, hit the strips, set up shops
Stay with a Glock
All I need is arm and hammer
Hot chopper with a bend thatâ€™ll make a nigga ass shape
Grip the handle
All my shit crack, nigga
All my shit crack, nigga

You ought to watch a nigga out here
And put cut on the yogurt
We gon'sell you something that won't turn over
Hit y'all with a flip flail
Beat the fuck off your cask
Now you're looking with your mask
And the games that I don't play
And took a loss in a minute
Nigga trapping a nigga ass, gotta feel it
I ain't spared nobody
Keep a head on the swift liner
Shit is got real creep
Everybody out here tryna eat
Young niggers wild and all
See, you don't wanna ride with them
When it come to the cash I feel them
Breaking no loses
Everything gotta count
Breaking mine, I'll die to the ounces
All I need is a big lick, big chain
Big practice, yeah, all I do is big things

[Chorus:]
All I need is baking soda
And a fork, and a scale
And I hope these niggas don't tell
All I need a bad bitch
Who will suck me on the road
So I don't fall asleep driving with the dope
I'mma tell you what I don't need
And that's some nigga in my business
When I go to Carpoon take him with me
That's a lesson that I did learn
And the cracker get behind me
Don't you turn off, nigga they will fool you
One thing that I d know, if they ask
And they search you, in your car
You better tell them hand over
While my lawyer ain't with me
Motherfucker ain't talking
I got a motherfucking pistol in my pocket
If I get another quelude
She will love me in the morning
Look, I got me feeling like I'm Tony
Take a look at me, I'm bad guy
Motherfucker don't want that
I ain't never crossed a nigga who didn't
Have it coming

[Chorus:]
All my shit crack, nigga
All my shit crack, nigga
