[Chorus]

I won’t lie, stay focused
Can’t let these crackers send me up the road
Send me up the road
Keep my clique small, all soul
Can’t let these crackers send me up the road
Send me up the road

They won’t gonna meet with anybody ain’t supposed to
And you ain’t sliding with the clique if I ain’t known you
I only fuck with certain niggas, only chosen few
And being friendly with a bitch, that I ain’t known to do
They see me cracking, turn home boy? I guess they don't
They seen some of the realest niggers turn from real to soft
Walk life, that's the only way I'm known to walk
Bitch, I will rave black killers, so they are known to talk
And what most niggers do when I is closing in
See that shit a hundred times, nigga, turn on their friend
Got niggers telling lies, trying to shorten their biz
Fuck niggers in the County, in the State and the Feds

[Chorus]

I tell these niggers all the time, you can't finess a finesser
Always trying to keep my distance from a whole ass nigga
The way you loose focus, I'd hum end up in the system
Love money like you do, but bitch I also impress with it
Shit may seem complicated, but this shit real simple
These crackers owe some money, shit
They trying to hide a nigga
If they ain't serving nigga before
Then they ain't serving a nigga
Call my phone, talking stupid
Call that note they been listening
Understand, we still the same from way back in the day
If you spread your self esteem, you wind up in the maze
Most people that you meet ain't got some whole ass ways
If your as sin the game, you have to know how to play

[Chorus]

Niggers ask me why I don't smile
'cause this shit ain't no game
And why I'm always riding dolo
'cause this shit ain't the same
Too many niggers turn south
It's too many the night
And if I ever let you do me
I'm the one I gon'blame
Impared ass niggers do everything
That they hear
That's why I don't stop and talk to niggers
I just speak and I deal
Stand on point, mandatory
'cause tomorrow you'll slip
Keep the niggers off your game
...
If everybody claim real
'cause some real shit happens
Everybody hollar snake
'till they get right on crackers
If I ever loose the road
It's gon'be cause of me
Expect nothing off these niggers
So keep it real with me
That's why

[Chorus]
