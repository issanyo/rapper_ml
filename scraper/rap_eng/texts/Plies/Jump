[Intro: Plies]
Jump, jump, jump
Hey, babe, you know I want you to jump, right?
Jump, jump, jump
Next to a good thing came a long way
Jump, jump, jump

[Verse 1: Plies]
Call me when you getting out the shower, be in ya bed waiting on ya with a towel
Let that pussy air dry like a flower and if you bad, I’ll bang yo ass on a Rover
I’m looking at it from the back, in ya G-string, pussy hanging out the bottom of yo G-string
I’m getting naked off rip, baby no shame, fuck mine, I want you make me call yo name
Grab yo hand, put yo hand on the shower, not that one, I’m talking the one in my boxers
A macdaddy night, all gas no brakes, I been drinking so you know I'mma act a donkey
Let me feed the banana to that monkey, throw that pussy back at me like you mad, bae
She call you when she wanna go to eat, she call me when she wanna get freaky

[Hook: August Alsina]
Cause it's 5 o'clock in the morning, I'm turnt up and I'm horny

Girl, so come here and jump on it
Come here and jump on it

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Club so low, one peep, fuck a valet cause I parked on the street
Lord knows that you can't trust these hoes cause yo girl keep looking at me
Sending me a text like she lonely, telling me to keep her company
Pull up in the truck, all you hear 'bip-bip', hop in, lemme hit it from the back, skeet skeet
She love that, I'mma real a nigga, and the hoe can't tell me nothing
She pop the molly, she sweating, she pop the pussy, I'm busting
She hit me back cause she love it, I hit her back when I need it
She fuck with you cause you love her, she fuck with me for one reason

[Hook: August Alsina]

[Verse 3: Plies]
I don't even want it, baby, if you the nympho, finna eat you from the back that's an insult
Pull that eyes, you can look at the click though, wanna kiss on yo other set of lips, though
Give to me like I'm home on the furlow, rip a face sp I can show you where that mouth go
Make noise, I be fucking with yo ego, you ever see that lil nigga on his tippy toes?
But that ya got me feeling that I'm 64, have you leaking, you a thing that you want a bro
I don't make announce, since I make statements, lights on so I can see you make places
Not one, make you look by the cases, she say I'm vain, so I know I be the least set
When I go see her, we don't ever watch movies, when I go see her, we get straight to it

[Hook: August Alsina]
