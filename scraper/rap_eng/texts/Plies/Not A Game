Last couple months boy this shit been off the chain
And ain't nobody round here care nun bout ya name
Yung niggas wildin pullin stunts I never seen
Only thing I can tell you boy this shit is not a game
Boy, this shit it not a game, this shit is not a game
This shit done got dead serious around here mane
And ain't nobody round here care nun bout ya name
The last couple months round here been off the chain boy, this shit is not a game
One thang about it is we gonna get it how we live
And whoever in the way I guess it is what it is
Clothes hangin on the line
Cause we payin for no cleaners
And ask niggas around here niggas dying bout them sneakers
Them
Niggas just ain't the ones wearing blue and red
I know some soldiers don't bang that will put it on your ass
Them yungin with them gold teeth and wic'd out with them dread
Just ran up in the candy lady house and patched ha head
Last 3-4 months around here it's been raining led
Niggas thirsty for them yoppas they in the pawn shop bad
Instead off self surrenderin
Niggas shooting it out instead
The police and them state troopers got all them bitches scared
I don't know if I agree but they holler the dope game dead
Cause so many motherf*ckers hit lics with dem income tax checks
Heard the mail man just got it, bitch had him in the choke
Bitch needed that lil bit and he was moving too slow
Last couple months boy this shit been off the chain

Boy, this shit it not a game, this shit is not a game
This shit done got dead serious around here mane

When the pizza man dnt deliver, you know you in the gutta
Cause all that mean is too many niggas done rob the motherf*cka
To the nigga that came home, from doing a bunch of calendars
To the hoes that might need something to the jits that need nothing
If You going to the club, then you better park in the front
If you come out and you flagging, off top boy you done
Them 8's they mean money I know it feel good to be stuntin
But you better be a 1000 nigga, don't f*ck round and be 100
Cause at any given time nigga a nigga will make you dump it
You can play games with them hoes don't you f*ck round with that money
Jus ran into one of my homies, I seen looking funny
When head came clean told me nigga hit them for them skunions
Better watch what you buy, niggas sell yo ass a dummy
Nigga stop by my grandma house with a whole truck of furniture
Nigga told me he'll sell the whole truck for 2, 700
Nigga said f*ck that job, nigga he jus need the money!
