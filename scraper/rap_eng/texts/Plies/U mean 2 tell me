2 x Hook:
You mean to tell me you fuckin all these niggas, you ain't got no money
You mean to tell me nigga you ain't a boss, you just a runner
You mean to tell me you ain't really got it, you get flexin
You mean to tell me got you down, Tiny made you tell it

You say you the brick man, but you can't make bond
You say you ride Raris but never drove a foreign
I'm a real brick man and all my plugs they foreign
I get bricks so say so, some days when I get bored
This bitch keep callin my phone
These hoes talkin bout she's broke
I'll play it how it go
Bitch better come sell some dope
Take me to yo boss man, nigga this ain't yo game
In my hood we got black Mexicans, cus we live in Mexico
