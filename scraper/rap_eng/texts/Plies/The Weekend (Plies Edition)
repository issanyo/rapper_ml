[Verse 1]
You say you got a girl
Yeah, how you want me?
How you want me when you got a girl?
The feelin' is reckless
Of knowin' it's selfish
And knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love
Fallin' all over love, like
Do it 'til it hurts less
Hangin' out the back, all up in your lap
Like is you comin' home? Is you out with her?
I don't care long as you're here by
10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, give me what I want

[Chorus]
My man is my man, is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Verse 2 Plies]
Girl, I hate pullin’ out got to put you on the pill
Friends say that ain’t shit, but it is what it is
I know it ain’t mine, but I beat it like it is
I don’t crab with the check imma help you with the bills
Girl, I know you fuck with me I can feel it in my soul
Girl, I know this dick good I can see it in your toes
Tryna gag you when you suck it have it runnin’ out your nose
Only bad bitches want me they be all at my shows
When we link up it’s like peanut butter and jelly
You can First 48 me, girl, you know I ain’t tellin’
Run through Neiman’s cause you know that ain’t petty
Bae, premium with the pussy other bitches unleaded
Keep it on the low, ‘lll be low-key with it
Pussy real fire you get the door key with it
Talkin’ ‘bout a bag, gon’ approach me with it
Bae say I’m nice ‘cause I wipe her when we finish
Care what they say you the shit to me
Some things, babe, just meant to be
Misery, baby, loves company
Like Meghan for the Prince you the one for me
If you just want to rent it we can arrange that too
The dick like Uber I can bring it to you
I play it how it goes, bae, it's all up to you
You want it on the weekend I’m with that too

[Verse 3]
I gotta say I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean I'm saying what kind of deal, just two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them, more of them
More you on me, on us
Just tell me you want me, yeah
Monday and I'll be at your door, ready to take her place
Ready to give you, what you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for
10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, I know what you want

[Chorus]
My man is my man, is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday (don't worry 'bout none)
Then just send him my way (don't worry 'bout none)
Think I got it covered for the weekend
