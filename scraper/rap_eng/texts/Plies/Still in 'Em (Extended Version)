[Intro]
Ay, homie
Y'all tuned into a real nigga, dog
Real nigga every day, 365, you feel me, dog?
Ay, I can die tomorrow, homie
I'm good, I done lived it, you feel me, homie?

[Chorus]
I got pistols, got money, got street cred
Got the whips, got hoes, got jewelry
Got one foot in the street, the other foot in the Feds
Real nigga, so it's some things I ain't never did
Never snitched, never bitched up and never ran
Never hated, never copped deuces, never that
Ain't who you know in the streets, it's what you did in them
Been through it all in the streets and I'm still in them

[Verse 1]
A real nigga every day, 365
And when I talk to you, don't look off, I look in your eye
If it's pussy nigga, I'ma get it out you every time
And I done made it where if you a fuck nigga, you can't survive
I speak the truth while y'all pussy niggas living lies
I know the streets, homie, I don't know the other side
The niggas in prison the ones who give me the drive
Real nigga first, rap nigga by accident
A street nigga and a product of my environment
Me being a fuck nigga is something that was never meant
And I don't vibe with pussy niggas, that's common sense
Me being a real nigga is all I done ever been

[Chorus]
I got pistols, got money, got street cred
Got the whips, got hoes, got jewelry
Got one foot in the street, the other foot in the Feds
Real nigga, so it's some things I ain't never did
Never snitched, never bitched up and never ran
Never hated, never copped deuces, never that
Ain't who you know in the streets, it's what you did in them
Been through it all in the streets and I'm still in them

[Verse 2]
I only fuck with niggas that's street certified
And I only fuck with niggas, dog, that'll up fire
If you ain't 'bout that gangsta, nigga, keep sliding
And don't you niggas get it fucked up, I ain't friendly
I speak to you niggas 'cause that's the real nigga in me
But being a pussy ass nigga ain't part of the business
A thug nigga, real nigga all in one, you hear me?
I ain't one of these niggas that blew and surround himself with killers
My niggas was killers back then; they killers now, nigga
I ain't one of these pussy ass niggas that run forty deep
Give me four or five real niggas and a lot of heat
Don't care what it look like, pimping, it ain't sweet
So if I ain't what you looking for, I can get you on TV
Laid in a pool of blood, covered in a white sheet
And do your research, the streets'll vouch for me
You hear the real nigga in me every time I speak

[Chorus]
I got pistols, got money, got street cred
Got the whips, got hoes, got jewelry
Got one foot in the street, the other foot in the Feds
Real nigga, so it's some things I ain't never did
Never snitched, never bitched up and never ran
Never hated, never copped deuces, never that
Ain't who you know in the streets, it's what you did in them
Been through it all in the streets and I'm still in them
