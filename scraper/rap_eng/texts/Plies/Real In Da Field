All my niggas I love them niggas
Swear before God man I’d kill for them niggas
Tonight I don’t want no cut on my liquor
Probably already done fucked up my liver
Me and my team fucking all these broads
And everybody couldn’t name one of us here
We all was the one when the dope fired up
Niggas went to robbin’ when the dope dried up
Drop money had the pussy price way up
Went back down when the drop dried up
Now the dope boys nigga back in the kitchen
Now the hoes back trying to fuck the nigga wit it
How a nigga get it ain’t nun bitch business
Real nigga dawg ain’t neva left the trenches
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit
