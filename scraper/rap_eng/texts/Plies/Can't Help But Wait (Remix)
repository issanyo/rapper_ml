[Intro:]
I can't help but wait
Ohh uh

[Trey Songz:]
I see you, you with him
He ain't right but you don't trip
You stand by while he lies
Then turn right round and forgive
I can't take to see your face
With those tears runnin down your cheeks
But what can I do
I gotta stay true
Cause deep down I'm still a G

[Bridge:]
And I don't want to come between you and your man
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

[Hook:]
Girl I can't help but wait
Till you get back with him it don't change
Can't help but wait
Till you see that with me it ain't the same
Can't help but wait
Till you see you for what you really are
Baby girl you are a star
And I can't help but wait

[Plies:]
I can tell how u walk he ain't sexing u right
Imagine us takin cold showers late night
Kissin all over yo body, mouth full of ice
Lay u flat while I rub lotion on yo back
Help u grease yo scalp while I drink Yac
And let u spray my cologne on yo t-bags
Answer all yo questions bout a goon life
Whisper bust it baby in yo ear, how u like
We make love to each other after we play fight
I know it's good cause u squeezing me real tight
U got the qualities of being a real good wife
U'll feel better after u get the lame out ya life

[Hook:]
Girl I can't help but wait
Till you get back with him it don't change

Till you see you for what you really are
Baby girl you are a star
And I can't help but wait

And I see what you need so

Let you catch what you've been missing

Girl cause I can't help but wait
Till you get back with him it don't change

Till you see that with me it ain't the same
