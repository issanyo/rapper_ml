Talk stupid hate on me, it ain't nothin but motivation
You jus wanna be a nigga, it ain't nothing but motivation

Countin these racks evrey day, it ain't nothing but motivation
Motivation, motivation, it ain't nothing but motivation
Motivation, motivation, it ain't nothing but motivation
Motivation, motivation, it ain't nothing but motivation
I'd ask you for what it is, it ain't nothing but motivation
Vrs 1:
Watch came in jeweler said come pick it up, Said I ain't wearing that, he better ICE it up
When I used to rob my favorite line was Nigga give it up
I went ta buy one of them things, I told em weigh it up
These niggas hatin on me Cuz, but they ain't hating enough
Just counted a half a M, thats how i got these paper cuts
I'm in that white double R (Rolls Royce) nigga with white guts
I got that Henney VSOP nigga in a white cup
The only Nigga they let in the club that they dont search
You tell that pussy nigga I said get his CASH UP
Ya'll got it all wrong, ya'll got it backwards, I need the motivation, I dont care what ya hatin for

Vrs 2:
Just left Atlanta now im headed back to FLA
Crib like a mall, think i care bout what a pussy say?
Just sent some money to my nigga in prison the other day
He said them niggas say i'm the realist nigga the eva seen
He either broke or he a rapper he talkin sideways
I'm either drunk or in some pussy, I'm on a Rampage
Nigga i'm a nice guy I'll give yo ass the whole Cake
When i was broke i guess nobody had shit to say
When i was losin nigga told me I was super great
Now that im winnin niggas out here dropin super weight
A real nigga i would rather have it no other way
Motivation nigga thats all that i gotta say!
