Me & my niggas you know we 'bout it
Me & my niggas you know we 'bout it
Can't see it all cause you know we got it
Me & my niggas you know we 'bout it
Me & my niggas you know we 'bout it
Know we 'bout it, know we 'bout it
Can't see it all cause you know we got it
Know we bout it, know we bout it

[Verse 1]
Had to pulled up at the trap nigga
With that Calico on my lap nigga
They took the "O" out my phone nigga
Her pussy stank what wrong with her
I want top the fuckers off my phone nigga
You pussy niggas get domed nigga
Just sprayed the Pontiac chrome nigga

Yo' killers ain't never killed nigga
Yo' killers ran they see clips nigga
Your goons like they lift weights nigga
My goons don't do shit but take nigga

[Verse 2]
Had to land it at the mall nigga
My bone cocked to my draws nigga
You pussy niggas like broads nigga
Last ho I fucked she got doughed nigga
That's how my dogs collect cars nigga
We don't got sticks we got lugs nigga
No tattoos in my face nigga
I got bodies under my waist nigga
On that couch nigga with that ace nigga
All 4 my pocket got caped nigga
You snitch pussy too late nigga
Snatch, rob & came in 'em face nigga

[Hook]
