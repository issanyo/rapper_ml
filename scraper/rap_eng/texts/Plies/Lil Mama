[Intro]
Plies, the new nigga over here at Slip-n-Slide Records
Little mama wanna fuck me
Little mama wanna fuck me
And you ain't never fucked a dope boy before?
Little mama wanna fuck me
Shit, you ain't never been fucked before then, baby

[Chorus]
Little mama wanna fuck me
Nigga, I already know
You ever fucked a dope boy before
Little mama wanna fuck me
You fucking with a real nigga now
You never fucked a dope boy? You is now
Little mama wanna fuck me
Nigga, I already know
You ever fucked a dope boy before
Little mama wanna fuck me
You fucking with a real nigga now
You never fucked a dope boy? You is now

[Verse 1]
Two things I ain't hurting for is pussy and money
So if you with that bullshit, then find you a fuck nigga, mami
You fucking with a nigga with cash that got a little something
I ain't one of these niggas out here in these streets that's hustling for nothing
I see you're sweating me, so you know what money look like
If you don't suck no dick, then baby, you ain't my type
I fuck good, so I can make the pussy all right
And I don't even want the pussy, baby, if you ain't gon' throw it back
You wanna lock me? Fuck me better than the rest of these hoes
'Cause if the pussy babbit, little mama, I'ma let you know
'Cause I'm a real nigga, I play this shit how it go
It ain't no secret, baby, fuck it, I hustle for mine
I wanna give you something that's on me, don't you ask me for mine
'Cause if these crackers get me, you gon' help me do none of this time
So when you niggas see me, you better put your hoe up
'Cause if I want that bitch, I'ma make her pack it up

[Chorus]
Little mama wanna fuck me
Nigga, I already know
You ever fucked a dope boy before
Little mama wanna fuck me
You fucking with a real nigga now
You never fucked a dope boy? You is now
Little mama wanna fuck me
Nigga, I already know
You ever fucked a dope boy before
Little mama wanna fuck me
You fucking with a real nigga now
You never fucked a dope boy? You is now

[Verse 2]
You done stopped speaking 'cause you heard I'm fucking her, too
Now you're hating on me, what kind of nigga is you?
Nigga, I could fuck that whore whenever I want to
And call that hoe at four in the morning and that bitch would move
You eating the pussy and breaking bread, the hoes ain't stunting you
And it ain't no shit, dog, that a real nigga won't do
You need to thank me, I'm the reason that hoe sucking you
And these hoes wanna fuck me because they done heard about me
And when you getting pussy off that, then you somebody
That's why when it come to getting pussy, I ain't worried about it
I'm from the city where every-motherfucking-body talk
And the word in the streets, I can fuck and got money, boy
And don't you holla at me, baby, if your period on
Unless you want me to fuck you with your period on
And your homegirls already told you my money long
And if you are a hater, then get some pussy, nigga, you dead wrong

[Chorus]
Little mama wanna fuck me
Nigga, I already know
You ever fucked a dope boy before
Little mama wanna fuck me
You fucking with a real nigga now
You never fucked a dope boy? You is now
Little mama wanna fuck me
Nigga, I already know
You ever fucked a dope boy before
Little mama wanna fuck me
You fucking with a real nigga now
You never fucked a dope boy? You is now

[Bridge]
Little mama wanna fuck me, you ain't never fucked a dope boy
Fuck me, you ain't never fucked a dope boy
Fuck me, you ain't never fucked a dope boy
Fuck me, you ain't never fucked a dope boy
Fuck me, you ain't never fucked a dope boy
Fuck me, you ain't never fucked a dope boy
Fuck me, you ain't never fucked a dope boy
Fuck me (Slip-n-Slide in this bitch, shorty)

[Chorus]
Little mama wanna fuck me
Nigga, I already know
You ever fucked a dope boy before
Little mama wanna fuck me
You fucking with a real nigga now
You never fucked a dope boy? You is now
Little mama wanna fuck me
Nigga, I already know
You ever fucked a dope boy before
Little mama wanna fuck me
You fucking with a real nigga now
You never fucked a dope boy? You is now
