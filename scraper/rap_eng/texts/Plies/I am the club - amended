This here a message, homie, to anybody who possibly
Gon' be in the club that I'm goin' in tonight, homie
You better go ahead and get ya shine on
Before I get to the club, dawg
Let me think tonight, what Ima do at the club?
Might show up tonight just to throw dubs
Or I might buy the bar to *** with the scrubs
How I feel tonight, shawty, I am the club
Let me think tonight, what Ima do at the club?
Might show up tonight just to throw dubs
Or I might buy the bar to *** with the scrubs
How I feel tonight, shawty, I am the club
Parked the whip out front, jumped out stuntin'
Neck full of jewels, whole pocket full of money
All the goons around me, so you know I'm comin'
Half a brick in my pocket, ten stacks on me
Better let me ball, you want no problem, homie
Last problem in the club somebody start dumpin'
I'm the main attraction, y'all peons
Got a dope boy knot on me, no one
Came through the side door, slid with my ***
Somebody daughter gettin' it, the question which one?
'Gnaced up and on good *** body numb
Let me show you how a real goon have fun
Let me think tonight, what Ima do at the club?
Might show up tonight just to throw dubs
Or I might buy the bar to *** with the scrubs
How I feel tonight, shawty, I am the club
Let me think tonight, what Ima do at the club?
Might show up tonight just to throw dubs
Or I might buy the bar to *** with the scrubs
How I feel tonight, shawty, I am the club
Y'all in trouble tonight, we got the club locked
We ain't dancin' over here, all we do is bop
One thang fo' sho', we got them hammers cocked
Look at all the dimes sweat us, they comin' by the flock
Look at the lil' hater over there, got him hot
Seen him lookin' at me, so I held up a knot
I don't know if you know, homie, I run the spot
And don't you play with me, you ain't got enough shots
Order mine straight up, drank it on the rocks
Been in the club five minutes and then closed shop
How can one *** be this *** hot?
I don't know if it's me, it might be the watch
Let me think tonight, what Ima do at the club?
Might show up tonight just to throw dubs
Or I might buy the bar to *** with the scrubs
How I feel tonight, shawty, I am the club
Let me think tonight, what Ima do at the club?
Might show up tonight just to throw dubs
Or I might buy the bar to *** with the scrubs
How I feel tonight, shawty, I am the club
Slid through the club late, all I need is a hour
Like they told me, lil' homie, money is power
Ran the streets all day, I'm fresh out the shower
Watch how a goon rock, let me show you my volume
Check my track record, homie, all I beat is stallions
I done smashed already, ***, you can have her
If you want her, better catch her, better go and snatch her
Want straight animals over here, no hackers
Better put the cuffs on her 'fore the goons pack her
When we leave the club, watch you follow after
Y'all ain't groupies, baby, stop bein' embarrassed
This one here in the book, this one a closed chapter
Let me think tonight, what Ima do at the club?
Might show up tonight just to throw dubs
Or I might buy the bar to *** with the scrubs
How I feel tonight, shawty, I am the club
Let me think tonight, what Ima do at the club?
Might show up tonight just to throw dubs
Or I might buy the bar to *** with the scrubs
How I feel tonight, shawty, I am the club
