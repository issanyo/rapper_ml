[Intro]
This Plies, nigga
The new nigga at Slip-n-Slide Records, nigga
And I don't need Slip-n-Slide to carry me, homeboy
I'm carrying Slip-n-Slide
Nigga, I'm the hottest motherfucking nigga in Florida right now, nigga
You goddamn right, I said I'm the hottest nigga in Florida right now, nigga
And I can prove mine, nigga
Plies, take off

[Verse 1]
Let me put you in the mind of a dope getter
And give it to you from the level of a street nigga
I'm a small time nigga with a big city hustle
And I'm the true definition of what you call gutta
And I can get mine the ski mask way or off the muscle
And this year, I'ma make it hard for you motherfuckers
And if you know anything 'bout me, you know I don't fuck with
Busters
And if you anything 'bout me, you know I keep it cutter
I'm in a '72 Donk 454
I put chrome in my shit and got rid of the oak
And I ain't a chico, so I don't ride 100 spokes
I'm burning good reefer, so I got the roof open
I got a message for the jack boy: keep scoping
Until you rob me, nigga, pussy nigga, you just hoping
This ain't something that just happened, I've been G code
I've been through too much to vibe with pussy nigga for what it shows
I learned not to fuck with pussy a long time ago
And me and lames don't even vibe, you already know
And I ain't the future of Slip-n-Slide, I'm the right now
It ain't no pressure on me, nigga, 'cause I can carry mine
I told Shay I wasn't leaving the streets when I signed
'Cause the hood depending on me, nigga, to hold them down
And I promised myself I'll never get commercialized
These crackers can't play me, nigga, 'cause I'm too streetwise
And if you ain't in the streets, don't try to give me street advice
And I don't fuck with you rap niggas, you tell too many lies
Fuck going platinum right now, I'm chasing street dreams
I can't depend on this music shit, I like nice things
Something 'bout that kingpin status, that amuse me
Only thing that can stop me right now: that federal indictment
And if they do come and they snatch me, then I gotta sit
I know the process, keep my mind closed, speak to the strip
I told my brother to promise to take care of my jit
But if them crackers don't come, I'ma lock dis rap shit
And you can tell them rap niggas I said it's over with
Only way them niggas is gon' be able to eat is get is if I'm featured on they shit
When I cut the deal with Slip-n-Slide, I told them to hold my check
I got my own money, shit, I'm trying to find a connect
I'm in Dade County, so show me where them Cubans at
'Cause a real hustler know how to make his money stretch

[Interlude]
Ay, nigga, I can make a believer out you, nigga
You ain't saying nothing, homeboy
I can take off again right now, fuck nigga

[Verse 2]
From Dade County to Duval, my music in every trap
And if you real, you gon' fuck with me and that's a known fact
I got something that most of these rap niggas lack
And that's a street resume that go way back
A young nigga fourteen jumped off the porch
And I was the young nigga that all the old crews coached
The same niggas in prison now who showed me the ropes
And they ain't got nothing else to live for, I'm their only hope
'Cause a real nigga last forever, fuck niggas come and go
And getting off first, that's a G nigga motto
I'm on fire, they ask nann right nigga for help
'Cause I know I can stand up in the paint my motherfucking self
And I'm one of the few niggas out here left
And I'll put up a bird on my motherfucking self

[Outro]
Ay, ay, we could run this motherfucker back, dog
I'll stay up in this bitch all night, my nigga
To prove to you niggas, dog
That I'm the trillest nigga in this shit right now, dog
And if you don't believe me, nigga
Come see 'bout me, dog
