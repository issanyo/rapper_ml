[Intro (Sample from The Sopranos clip): Christopher Moltisanti & bakery worker]
What is it? What is it? Do I look like a pussy to you?
No
I'm serious. Be honest. I won't get mad
No
No. So why the fuck would you give me a hard time and talk to me like I'm nothing to worry about?
I-I-I'm sorry
Next time you see my face, show some respect
I will
*Christopher Moltisanti shoots worker's foot*
You motherfucker! You shot my foot!
It happens
Oh, you fucking asshole!

[Plies]
100% Real Nigga, dog
It's self-explanatory, my nigga
It don't get no realer than this one here, homie
I ain't one of these niggas you're listening to, dog
And ain't 'bout what I'm motherfucking rapping 'bout, dog
If I ain't live it, nigga, I don't put it in my music, dog
If I don't own it, nigga, I don't speak on it, dog
If I'ma give it to you, I'ma give it to you one motherfucking way, dog
And that's straight off the key, nigga
Uncut, dog
100% motherfucking real nigga, dog
I'm certified, nigga
