Dog, every time I think my luck fucked up
Or I think I'm down, battered, my day ain't going good, dog
I remind myself, my nigga
That somewhere, dog, today
A bitch just caught 20, 30, 40 years
A cracker just gave a bitch, dog
That's the only way I make it out of here, man
Every time I think this shit getting bad out here for me, dog
I remind myself, dog
It's a bitch that just got they life took from them today, dog
Somewhere, my nigga
Man, it's a lot of niggas that's locked up, dog, right now, man
And niggas forgot about them, man
Man, do me a favor, dog, if don't do nothing else for me, my nigga
Man, send your dog something, man
Find out where he at, my nigga
And this on some real nigga shit, homie
Buckshot, I got you, nigga
Dog, to all the real niggas that's locked up right now, dog
Free all the real niggas, man
You can keep them fuck niggas in there
Free all the real niggas, my nigga
