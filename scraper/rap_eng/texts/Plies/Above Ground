[Chorus]
I'm just happy I'm above ground
Some may make it this time around
I'm just happy I'm above ground
I'm just happy I'm above ground
I'm just happy I'm above ground
Some more got gunned down
I'm just happy I'm above ground
I'm just happy I'm above ground

[Verse 1]
Thank god every day I wake up
For letting me see another 24
And I ain't letting nobody stress me
I just dance for damn shows
And some people might make happy
I'm just happy I ain't dead and gone
I'm just happy that I woke up
And my name ain't called in a tombstone
I'm just thankful my freedom here
That I can see a see help me
I don't care about all the bell for wussy
I'm just thankful for the selfish shit
I'm just happy I can still walk
I'm just happy I can still talk
I'm just happy that the judge thought look at me sitting my ass off
I'm just breathing this good air
You blessed bitch if you still here
Cuz someones who's out here
The entire lash ain't still here
Free all the ones who need freeing
Help all the ones in need
I ain't let nobody steal my joy
Cuz I'm happy bitch that I can still breathe

[Chorus]
I'm just happy I'm above ground
Some may make it this time around
I'm just happy I'm above ground
I'm just happy I'm above ground
I'm just happy I'm above ground
Some more got gunned down
I'm just happy I'm above ground
I'm just happy I'm above ground

[Verse 2]
I ain't ever have bad days
Best never let the devil have his way
Them broke six figure
I'ma keep a smile on my face
Only caught up into bullshit
I hold a gasp into dumb shit
And please don't call me
Telling me not somebody I had to say about
Because I ain't interested
All my focus on is keep shining
Keep balling ad keep grinding
Ain't word bout another dick
Cuz I'm too busy got to get mine
Ain't I looking for no love
You can keep your thousands keep your hoes
I ain't tryna keep it real with nobody
Out here we keep it real with us
Do you and I'ma do me
Cuz I am here where I gotta be
Cuz sometimes you can miss your blesses
When they right in front of you cuz you can't see
I swear to god I got a plan b
I ain't let nobody stopping me
I woke up this morning and was still above ground
So I'm winning bitch

[Chorus]
I'm just happy I'm above ground
Some may make it this time around
I'm just happy I'm above ground
I'm just happy I'm above ground
I'm just happy I'm above ground
Some more got gunned down
I'm just happy I'm above ground
I'm just happy I'm above ground
I'm just happy I'm above ground
Some may make it this time around
I'm just happy I'm above ground
I'm just happy I'm above ground
I'm just happy I'm above ground
Some more got gunned down
I'm just happy I'm above ground
I'm just happy I'm above ground
