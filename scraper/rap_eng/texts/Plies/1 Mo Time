(Chorus 2x)
I know you caught me cheating
And you tired of me lyin
Imma be honest with you baby
I know I crossed tha line
If you dont wanna f**k with me no mo than cool it's fine
But before you go baby
Can we f**k one more time

(Verse 1)
I know I f**ked up and sorry ain't
What you wanna here but i can't change
That shit dog it is what it is
You can go f**k another nigga if thats how you feel
If thats goin to make you feel better than gone do it hell you asked me about this lil petty
Shit and i kept it real, know that shit probably hard for you to swallow still I ain't know how
Bad i hurt you til' I seen ya tears I ain't asking you to accept how a nigga live, if you feel
Like another nigga can treat you better, than it is what it is. but let the truth be told its
Been my pussy for years. now you got all ya lil home girls up in ya ear just lets f**k one more
Time before you dip

(Chorus 2x)

(Verse 2)
I know its probably best for us to go our seperate ways, cause i know me imma f**k up again
Anyway but in my muhf**kin heart a nigga want you to stay cause once you f**k up this shit can
Never be straight im dead ass wrong thats why i ain't got shit to say bet you think a nigga didn't
Give a f**k anyway i just had to f**k you good the other day and how that pussy was bitin i
Didn't wanna scape you rode that dick so long until you started to shake and i can tell when you
Would nut i can see it in ya face imma miss f**kin you from the back and how i grabbed ya waist
But most of all imma miss how that pussy taste

(Chorus 2x)

(Verse 3)

But bae you know its true I know i f**ked up i said im sorry now its on you. you can play
Stupid and give me away if you want too. if you say f**k it its over then i guess we through i

Shit we going through right now is real silly gone cuss me out and lets f**k and gone kill it

(Chorus 2x)
