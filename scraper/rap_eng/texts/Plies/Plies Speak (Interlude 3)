Ay, bruh, Big Gates [?]
You a motherfucking genius, dog
Niggas should've killed you a long time ago, dog
It's too late now, homie
You told me, dog
We need to bring the real niggas back to the streets, homie
I think we done made the real niggas proud, dog
Ay, B, tell them niggas to cut that check, man
We'll talk about the bullshit later
And Shea, my nigga, it is what it is, pimping
Tell them crackers, dog
Triple that amount they talking about, dog
'Cause I'm three times harder right now
