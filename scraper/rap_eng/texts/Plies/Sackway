I don’t throw shots I throw money at a hater
I just wanna fuck, I don’t really want to date her
Just left the bank yeah I re’d up
Hittas on deck, yah they just ski’ed up
If ya hatin’ on me uncross yo nuts
If it ain’t about the bag then I ain’t in no rush
Worth eight-figures now you can get free lunch
Why ball every day ‘cus you only live once
Team full of winners we don’t fuck with the losers

[Chorus]
Yeah I been grindin’ like a vegan sackway
Gucci gang, gucci gang be a sackway
Bitch, I’m just leaving from the bank sackway
Blue cheese in a nigga pocket that sackway
Bitch, I been grindin’ all day yeah sackway
Gucci gang, gucci gang be a sackway
Bitch, I’m just leaving from the bank that sackway
Blue cheese in a nigga pocket that sackway

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I been ground all die like fuck it
Bitch, I'm a boss I don’t need no favor
I don’t throw shots just throw money at a hater
Just wanna fuck I don't really wanna date her
Just left the bank yeah I just re’up
Hitters on deck and they just ski’ed up
If ya hatin’ on me uncross your nuts
If it ain't about the bag then I ain't in no rush
Worth eight-figure now you can get free lunch
Why I ball everyday cuz your only live once
Wake up every morning with a bag on my mind
Can't click over I got cash on my line
Hustle for the fam I don't hustle for the jewel
Team full of winners we don’t fuck with the losers
You gotta fuck with me I'm like good dope
When it comes to getting money I'm the mother fucking G.O.A.T

[Chorus]
Yeah I been grindin’ like a vegan sackway
Gucci gang, gucci gang be a sackway
Bitch, I’m just leaving from the bank sackway
Blue cheese in a nigga pocket that sackway
Bitch, I been grindin’ all day yeah sackway
Gucci gang, gucci gang be a sackway
Bitch, I’m just leaving from the bank that sackway
Blue cheese in a nigga pocket that sackway

[Verse 2]
Love money so much might think a nigga Jewish
On the road so much might think a nigga tourist
When they ain't getting money they don't wanna see ya flourishing
In the air so much starting to feel like a stewardess
When they come to sack bitch I can be a tutor
I'ma shooting myself I don't pay for no shooters
So many hoes at the house starting to look like Hooters
If the bitch ain't bad I'ma sit her on a voodoo
Money so dirty bitch I might throw up
Hoes go to yelling at me pulling up
Story of my life bitch I love to grind
Feeling like prime bitch I love to shine
Wanna see me smile bitch bring me a bag
I don't like checks bring me cash
I'm just chilling sipping on a little latté
Riding 'round the city getting the sackway

[Chorus]
Yeah I been grindin’ like a vegan sackway
Gucci gang, gucci gang be a sackway
Bitch, I’m just leaving from the bank sackway
Blue cheese in a nigga pocket that sackway
Bitch, I been grindin’ all day yeah sackway
Gucci gang, gucci gang be a sackway
Bitch, I’m just leaving from the bank that sackway
Blue cheese in a nigga pocket that sackway

Sackway
Sackway
Sackway
Sackway
Sackway
Sackway

[Chorus]
Yeah I been grindin’ like a vegan sackway
Gucci gang, gucci gang be a sackway
Bitch, I’m just leaving from the bank sackway
Blue cheese in a nigga pocket that sackway
Bitch, I been grindin’ all day yeah sackway
Gucci gang, gucci gang be a sackway
Bitch, I’m just leaving from the bank that sackway
Blue cheese in a nigga pocket that sackway
