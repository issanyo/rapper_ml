[Intro]
(Bih) Bih stay asking me (Bih, Bih)
"man why you always saying bih?"
I told little bih, Ion know bih

[Chorus]
I'm the whole hunna bih, this my summer bih
Want that work and I got that work
Serve your ass from McDonald's bih
Ain't no one's bih, all these hunnas bih
Say it's a drop than it ain't no drop
This money move mountains bih

[Verse 1]
Ion need no motherfucking features (feature)
To the street I'm they motherfucking preacher (preach)
Bruh showed me how to cook dope the old school way with the motherfucking beakers (Skrr)
Niggas got rich off the reefer (reefer)
Money real I can reach it
She suck that dick and she play with them nuts at the same time nigga she a keeper
Came through stunting on Easter, I was 13 nigga with a beeper (beep)
Just got some pussy so motherfucking good had to shout-out the little bih Shekia

Just drop 10 bands on a Regal
When I walk in the liquor store they know what I want I get the half of gallon nigga not the liter

[Chorus]
I'm the whole hunna bih, this my summer bih
Want that work and I got that work
Serve your ass from McDonald's

Say it's a drop than it ain't no drop
This money move mountains bih

[Verse 2]
I'm home real late like Chucky
Keep my keys and rubbers on the dresser
Just walk in the fleet on 183rd
Just brought me a motherfucking 'presssor
Ain't talking about a Benz lil nigga (lil nigga)
Talking about putting dope on the stretcher
Beeg in the field all motherfucking day so long started to feel like a motherfucking Mexican
Fuck me real good I'ma bless you
Touch ann one my dawgs I'ma wet ya (bang)
Just brought two rollies for 75,000 and the PD cracker told me that's a special
Gave him 150 told him no pressure
Just imagine what I paid for the necklace (for the necklace)
I'm in the house right now with a house full of strippers
Everybody in this bih butt-naked

[Chorus]
I'm the whole hunna bih, this my summer bih
Want that work and I got that work
Serve your ass from McDonald's
Ain't no one's bih,  all these hunnas bih
Say it's a drop than it ain't no drop
This money move mountains bih

[Verse 3]
I ain't no motherfucking rapper just a real nigga dawg with a swagger
Wake up every morning getting to the motherfucking money so that mean I'm a trapper
Might bet it all on Dallas
House like I played for the Mavericks
White tee black tee and a couple hundred thousand worth of jewels on a nigga called fashion
Ion fuck bitches that's average get money nigga live lavish
4 hoes in one room in Miami fucked them all at one time nigga I'm a savage (savage)
Told little bih she tapping
Ion fuck with niggas who be crabbing
If a nigga ever told you he ever did something to me tell that fuck nigga, nigga stop flagging (you flagging)

[Chorus]
I'm the whole hunna bih, this my summer bih
Want that work and I got that work
Serve your ass from McDonald's
Ain't no one's bih,  all these hunnas bih
Say it's a drop than it ain't no drop
Than money move mountains bih
