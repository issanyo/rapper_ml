[Chorus]
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)

[Verse 1]
I left a meeting wit my realtor
I just might buy my whole hood
I don’t know what the fuck I'ma do it (I don’t know)
I might just do it to do it
She said I'm getting a little fat (fat)
My stomach got a little pudge
I told her work out for what
These bitches  gon’ still let me fuck
They say I fuck like a champ
I might just get into porn (porn)
I disrespect your little bitch
I call her three in the morning
I might just ride her through Lenox
Just like I'm in a parade
Pull up like I'm the president
Shut down the whole valet

[Chorus]
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)

[Verse 2]
I keep the stick on me daily
Just like I'm looking for Russia (Russia)
Star sixty-seven the bitch
I just mean I don't trust ya
I’m International
I like to fuck all the waitresses
I'm talking porno and pornos
Gotta man all of my branch
All of my houses they echo
All of my bitches they psycho
I done got checks so big
I thought that bitch was a typo
I might just start drinking lean
To help me deal with the cheatin’
I need money not friends
Money ain't ever called me


[Chorus]
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)

[Verse 3]
Yo bitch actin’ funny, she fuckin’, playa
Jacket cost me like sixty-five
I'm talking holo and over line
I'm taking pictures of Ocean Drive
So many sparkles on the bottle
I fuck round and burn down the whole club
So men are foreigns in my garage
I take a whole fare and then I crank 'em up
I gotta house inside a house
I got my head all up her blouse
I'm good in the H like Swisher House
My Piolt said don’t pop up unannounced
My money machine me losing count
I stuff’em so much ‘till I burn’em out
I make the most so I do to most
I will not ever go broke

[Chorus]
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
This money coming too easy (woo)
