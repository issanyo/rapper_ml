Whacked, whacked, whacked, whacked
Whacked, whacked, whacked, whacked
That will get you whacked
Oh you know I whack you out right
You know I whack you out right x 3

[Hook]
Reaching for my chain nigga, that will get you whacked, whacked
That will get you whacked, whacked
That will get you whacked, whacked
Talking sideways nigga, that will get you whacked, whacked
That will get you whacked, whacked

Tryina play a fool man
That will get you whacked, whacked
That will get you whacked, whacked
Playing by that cash nigga
That will get you whacked, whacked
That will get you whacked, whacked

Just brought a drop top, brought it for my shooters dem
Next time we out lurking, they can shoot from in this bitch
I be sliding realer car, 10 on them really dog
Got it in my whole name, I ain’t got a credit card
I am just a street nigga, tryina dodge sirens
Tryina get the gwap up, tryina stay up out the bing
I still get your ass whacked, still I drop them bands on you
Still I drop it all black, still I slide I ride run down on you
I still fuck with your pillar still fuck with newly been
Still fuck with halley too, still on that silly shit
I still lay your ass down, still I run up in the spot
Still I slap you with that 5
Still I lay off 100 shots

All for top lay it down, nigga I’m hardly lay it down
I don’t fuck with you boy, know what that mean and move round
Nigga I ain’t playing cool, lamers don’t get no conversation
All that gorilla talk, that will get you a home invasion
That will get your shit split, that will get them k’s waving
That will get them candids draw, that will get your bushes shakin
I ain’t with the peace treaty, nigga I’m halling fuck em all
And a nigga slide with it, fuck it, I’m halling whack em all
Since you niggas playing games, bitch I’m playing simon says
Told to all my young niggas simon says I want his head
That ain’t all simon said, cross the line with his ass
On this side nigga, we don’t wave white flags
