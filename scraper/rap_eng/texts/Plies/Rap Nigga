Man, dog
You all can't fool a real nigga ainna
Man, you can't fool no real nigga, dog
You can tell a fuck nigga anything, dog
But you can't run that shit on a real nigga
Y'all niggas, y'all rap niggas, dog
TV-ass niggas who done sold two, three, four-mill or five million records, dog
A million records
And you steady hollering, bitch, you got a hundred bars
And you got them for ten-five
Oh, you can't fool a real nigga, dog
Bitch, you a full-time rapper now, nigga
That's all you do
You rap
Ain't nothing wrong with being a full-time rapper, dog
But stop running on the...
I think you can run it on a real nigga, dog
And you little young niggas that's coming up, dog
Dropping a nigga a CD
Getting, wanting niggas to listen to your shit, nigga
And you on there talking 'bout you Birdman, bitch, and you ain't got a car
You on there, talking that gangsta and you ain't even did nothing out here
Next time, a nigga give you a CD, dog
And you listen to it
And you know this nigga ain't 'bout what he on here talking 'bout
Slap that fuck nigga right in his mouth, dog
You say you know a nigga realer than Plies
But where he at?
Certified, pussy ass nigga
100% real nigga, dog
Get it how you live, nigga
