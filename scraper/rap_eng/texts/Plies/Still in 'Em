[Intro]
Been telling y'all niggas, man
It ain't 'bout who you motherfucking run with, young nigga
It ain't 'bout where you motherfucking hang at, homie
It's 'bout what you did in these motherfucking streets, nigga
And how I feel about it, pimping
I done did everything but motherfucking die, nigga

[Chorus]
I got pistols, got money, got street cred
Got the whips, got hoes, got jewelry
Got one foot in the street, the other foot in the Feds
Real nigga, so it's some things I ain't never did
Never snitched, never bitched up and never ran
Never hated, never copped deuces, never that
Ain't who you know in the streets, it's what you did in them
Been through it all in the streets and I'm still in them

[Verse]
A real nigga every day, 365
And when I talk to you, don't look off, I look in your eye
If it's pussy nigga, I'ma get it out you every time
And I done made it where if you a fuck nigga, you can't survive
I speak the truth while y'all pussy niggas living lies
I know the streets, homie, I don't know the other side
The niggas in prison the ones who give me the drive
Real nigga first, rap nigga by accident
A street nigga and a product of my environment
Me being a fuck nigga is something that was never meant
And I don't vibe with pussy niggas, that's common sense
Me being a real nigga is all I done ever been

[Chorus]
I got pistols, got money, got street cred
Got the whips, got hoes, got jewelry
Got one foot in the street, the other foot in the Feds
Real nigga, so it's some things I ain't never did
Never snitched, never bitched up and never ran
Never hated, never copped deuces, never that
Ain't who you know in the streets, it's what you did in them
Been through it all in the streets and I'm still in them
