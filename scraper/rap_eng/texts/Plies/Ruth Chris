[Chorus]
I just had a dime all in Ruth Chris
Feelin' on her ass all in Ruth Chris
Playin’ in hair all in Ruth Chris
Might just gon' and fuck her right in Ruth Chris
I just had a dime all in Ruth Chris
Feelin' on her ass all in Ruth Chris
Playin’ in hair all in Ruth Chris
Might just gon' and fuck her right in Ruth Chris

[Verse 1]
I just fucked a model bitch, right in her Giuseppe
Still got that loud pack on me, you can smell it
Used to make a killin' now I'm trappin' out the telly
She asked me how I want the pussy, I told her on her belly
I just read a text message, she ask me can she suck it
Please tell your shooters before you send 'em bitch, I'm buckin’
You can catch me sliding through The Lou just like a Nelly
The thirty and this Glock got me feelin' like Makaveli
Got me on my Memphis shit, naw bitch I'm heavy
Had to stop fucking with that little bitch she was petty
All this god damn money, just like perfect credit
Tell’em if step wrong I’m gon’ knock out his Bugatti

[Chorus]
I just had a dime all in Ruth Chris
Feelin' on her ass all in Ruth Chris
Playin’ in hair all in Ruth Chris
Might just gon' and fuck her right in Ruth Chris
I just had a dime all in Ruth Chris
Feelin' on her ass all in Ruth Chris
Playin’ in hair all in Ruth Chris
Might just gon' and fuck her right in Ruth Chris

[Verse 2]
Walked in six chains on, thats my business suit
Might grown me a beard akhi, like them niggas in Philly do
I just hit a lick took a vaycay out in Malibu
Spent it all and made it right back like a trappa do
I just left the D I was thuggin’ in the 3-1-3
Feelin’ like the Choppa Boyz summer [???] rest in peace
Walked in with a cherry nose walked out with a dark skin
On day I was on my dick next day I was up again
I just told my main bitch she might want to get her tubes tied
I be wanting to leave it in, I don’t be wanna pull it out
I’m just in the [???] doing just a 100 Kodak
She ask me can she get the dick when I get there you already know that

[Chorus]
I just had a dime all in Ruth Chris
Feelin' on her ass all in Ruth Chris
Playin’ in hair all in Ruth Chris
Might just gon' and fuck her right in Ruth Chris
I just had a dime all in Ruth Chris
Feelin' on her ass all in Ruth Chris
Playin’ in hair all in Ruth Chris
Might just gon' and fuck her right in Ruth Chris
