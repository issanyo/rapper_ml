[Intro]
Welcome to F.E.M.A
Finesse, elevate, motivate, and achieve
Let's get it

[Verse 1: Plies]
Wish Gotti Youngsta Dolph go and squash the beef
Know that shit ain't none of my business I like to see niggas eat
I done put [?] I done caught a body
Said she don't want to go to sleep I told her pop a molly
Nickname cement bitch I'm super solid
You don't like me Bobby Brown [?]
Lady put a nigga bushes ain't discussing that
You say that you'll pay me later I ain't trusting that
Niggas say my nigga must be dropping mixtape
Think that I'll bust at you in public that's a mistake
Jack called go and get it ain't no time to sleep
I ain't trynna make friends bitch I'm trynna eat
Came from the bottom yo look at how time fly
Hard for me to trust niggas who don't look in my eyes
Nigga ask  for Plies why he bought a Bentley truck
Cuz Ion do what other niggas do you feel me bruh
Was on a beach last night bih massaging me
Whole inside of the crib [mahogany]
I was never supposed to make it past 25
Car full of [?] on 75
Up all night bih like I'm on a pill
Almost cried first time I touched my first meal
Ain't no social butterfly I keep my circle small
Do some sucker shit out here you come up missing dog
Put that bag for a lot of shit I used to do
Put shit before myself that's what I used to do
I will fuck a nigga bitch I'm being honest though
One thing I love about myself I keep it a hunnid though
I remember them long nights, nigga I couldn't remember nights
Bitch said a nigga arrogant, you fucking right
Shout out to all you niggas out here who pocket watching me
I ain't gonna disappoint you, I'm gonna give you some to see
Had to close another deal it got me motivated
Nigga acting like bitches I don't tolerate it
If you cross me it ain't none just stay over there
Bitch my house ain't no museum you got to fucking [?]
By any means out here, bitch Kevin Gates
Hoe told me I was popping, bitch you kind of late
Lot of you niggas still sleep, hit the snooze button
Bitch I might of still grinding, bitch at 2 some
Still riding with that stick, it ain't my fault bruh
Too many niggas out here dropping salt bruh
I'm just trynna get a sack and stay in my own lane
Money come before the pussy, I hope you understand
And all you begging ass bitches, I ain't friendly hoe
And tell your noisy ass friends about there business hoe
And when it's time to go to war niggas bitch up
You niggas sold a lot for that bag I never switch up
