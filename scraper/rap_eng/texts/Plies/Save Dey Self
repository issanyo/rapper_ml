[Intro]
They be on that, they be on that
They be on that save they self type shit
They be on that, they be on that
They be on that, they be on that
Save they self type shit

[Hook] (2x)
Bitch already know ain't for that
Sliding with a bitch who don’t know nann
Cause soon the bitch get jailed up
Already know how I been running
Bitch be on the save they self type shit
Bitch be on the save they self type shit

[Verse 1]
When a nigga see me, I'm olo
If I ain’t riding with the whackers,  I'm dolo
Cause the bitch screaming that silent shit
But when a bitch get jammed, they hollow
Already know what a bitch gon’ do
Bitch save they self and then do you
That's why I keep my circle, nigga, super small
And only fuck with niggas I do know
White tank top, no Polo
Hundred deep in my steelo
Big bear, nigga, my logo
Fuck game nigga, I don't play, though
Looking for the nigga with a kilo
Whack me a bitch for the cee-lo
Ran out on a bitch two do’
And [?]
I don't trust shit cause niggas is slimy
Better know who creep, and you better know who ride
I'm [?] and watching, I'm sticking and moving
Cause already told you, I know how they do it
Know what I’m saying?

[Hook] (2x)

[Verse 2]
Ain’t even for that, bruh
Cause I already know what a bitch gon’ do
Soon the crackers go to hollering all that time, bitch gon’ get spooked
Me and my niggas ain’t for that
[?] for a second, get shot at
If it's mine, dawg, I'ma take mine
Nigga, real nigga shit, I wear that
Ain't fucking with no new niggas
Cause all I fuck with is a few niggas
And all my niggas, they true niggas
And I [?] niggas
Real motherfuckers stay zipped tight
Ho ass niggas ain’t built right
Best thing to do is walk light
And I ain't with a bitch about my life
I don't trust shit cause niggas is slimy
Better know who creep, and you better know who ride
I'm [?] and watching, I'm sticking and moving
Cause already told you, I know how they do it
Know what I’m saying?

[Hook] (2x)
