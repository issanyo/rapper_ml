If you don't like how I type don't read the lyrics... simple

{intro}
You our president homie {team obama}
I guess going against Osama
And going to get Bin Ladin (0SAMA BIN LADIN)
I guess that wasn't enough huh?
But, who else done did it
They made you work for this one though...
But, LIKE THEY SAY

{chorus}

ROME wasn't built in a day (weren't built in a day x2)
X3
You said it's gone take time we gone believe
Whatever you say we gone ride for you you
Just ride for us and you just make sure we straight

{verse}

Everybody who lost somebody 9/11
I know they family should be proud of you
Got us jobs, caught bin-ladin and you still made time for your family too
You gave hope to the black man brought peace to the homeland rather you
Was white or black you made us feel like yea we can
You blew life to the middle class never made the poor feel bad
Only thing we ask of you is you don't forget about us thats all we ask
Trying to please the world thats a big task real force something
We never had and some people i know still mad because some of us need help real bad but
Rome wasn't built in a day (weren't built in a day} x2 we know we gone be alright long
As you do what you say you gone ride for us and we gone ride for you and we gone make sure you straight

{chorus}

{verse}

It's still people that's over worked
But, yet still they under paid
Still hard to keep a roof over your head especially
When you trying to live off of minimum wage
Crack law it was pass  it helped a lot it did that
But the justice system is still bad we still need work when it
Come to that but the school teachers teach our future
But yet still they treat us like a nuisance need more opportunity's
Less institution we still not protected by the constitution
The hood i still wrap my arms behind em so many people trying to still
Drown em We just like everybody else we just trying to survive in our surroundings
Lot of us still come from broken homes lot of us raised with our pops gone
I still salute you you still pushing on cause the hard times thats a champion mourn
If you fell down brush yourself off and come back stronger and lead us forward
If i learned one thing from Obama thats stand firm don't let em push you under

{chorus}

{verse}

Right now we not celebrating because its still issues we still facing
The best man he did win and that was clear in this case we not bragging
We just rejoicing to all us it feel great because right now we in a different space
Without you we was a lost race how it look? we on pace i speak god thats with our grace
Probably something we can't escape made mistakes so we came to race all genders all race
All us pushing one way we love to see our soldiers coming home thats something we all say
I know we pray for them everyday we pray to god that he keep em safe i hope none of em loose faith
Because we all know its gone be brighter days all the soldiers that we did lose i know god got em
In a better place your heart and your courage thats something can never be replaced

{chorus}
