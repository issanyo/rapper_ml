I dealt with death in my family, I thought my heart would never heal
When I was young, I never understood the pressure paying bills
I was lost and I was confused when my daddy disappeared
If I had to raise my kids by myself, I wonder how that would feel
I could they lay my Auntie off after 27 years
She got four kids and a grand-baby she try to take care
My lil’ niece 13, got her on birth control pills
There are some mornings I wake up feel like a slave in the fields
Started feeling like Pac ‘cause I done shed so many tears
This pressure on me still, I hold my head in the air
I refuse to let it break me ‘cause the world don’t give a damn
You won’t ever hear me complain even though it ain’t fair
Your mistakes in this world is another person’s smile
I may fall and I may…but I will never lay down
Dig deep in my soul and pick my soul up off the ground
‘Fore I let myself sink I’mma turn it all around

[Chorus]

I gotta keep pushing, I gotta keep pushing
I gotta keep pushing, I gotta keep pushing
I can’t look back, too many problems in my past
I can’t stand still ‘cause my life ain’t beaten path
I gotta keep pushing, I gotta keep pushing
I gotta keep pushing, I gotta keep pushing
I often ask the question why is God punishing me
He try to make me strong but that’s all that, it can’t be
I gotta keep pushing, I gotta keep pushing
I gotta keep pushing, I gotta keep pushing
I gotta keep pushing, I gotta keep pushing
I gotta keep pushing, I gotta keep pushing

I was born in the hood, I was born to be a fighter
Won't care about being perfect, 'cause it won't make you wiser
Some things I could control, some things weren't my fault
Ain't ever had regrets, even after I took the loss
I never fear a human, my only fear is God
'cause I don't know when he coming, and that's a scary thought
Or know my future whole, or when my last supper
But one thing that I do know, when I die, I'mma die hustler

[Chorus]
