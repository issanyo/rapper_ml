[Intro: Plies]
I don't fuck with nobody man I'm just out, you know what I'm saying, just out here tryna have a good time, man
I got some bitches with me, I got my little section man
While you out there, keep fucking with me man

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Be-be-be cool, y'all must wanna see me incarcerated
Stepping on my shoes, really wanna see me incarcerated
Take shit from who, make the news, get incarcerated
Bitch nigga like you? Act a fool, I get incarcerated
Keep fucking with me, show you what I'm gonna do
Keep fucking with me, what you wanna do?
Keep fucking with me, show you what I'm gon' do
Bitch nigga like you act a fool? I get incarcerated

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Fell out (Ugh), feel like I’m the life of the party (Ugh)
Can’t say this enough, I go dumb, retawdid (Ugh)
My lungs, they coughing, loaded in this bitch
Take off my shades, look at my eyes, they probably rolling in this bitch (WHO DAT)
Breadwinner Gang, look who taking off
You got something on your mind? Believe me, I could take it off
In the body shop with Meka talking threesomes, knock it off
Her cousin Tisha house in Monticino, dick I drop it off

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Be-be-be cool, y'all must wanna see me incarcerated
Stepping on my shoes, really wanna see me incarcerated
Take shit from who, make the news, get incarcerated
Bitch nigga like you? Act a fool, I get incarcerated
Keep fucking with me, show you what I'm gonna do
Keep fucking with me, what you wanna do?
Keep fucking with me, show you what I'm gon' do
Bitch nigga like you act a fool? I get incarcerated

[Verse 2: Plies]
Have an award for being real, y'all fuck niggas wouldn't get nominated
Did bought me a new AR cause that last one I had, that bitch got confiscated
Last nigga got pistol whipped, nigga before him got home invaded
Back on Preston, try me pussy
Let’s see who wind up in the newspaper
You ain't silly nigga, you know what I’m gone do
Pull up on ya ass, jump out in that Martin suit
Feel I got it, feel I owe you
Then guess what? then take it nigga
Phoned on your ass, first shot then I’m faking nigga

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Be-be-be cool, y'all must wanna see me incarcerated
Stepping on my shoes, really wanna see me incarcerated
Take shit from who, make the news, get incarcerated
Bitch nigga like you? Act a fool, I get incarcerated
Keep fucking with me, show you what I'm gonna do
Keep fucking with me, what you wanna do?
Keep fucking with me, show you what I'm gon' do
Bitch nigga like you act a fool? I get incarcerated
