I be on my shit, ainna
We be wit da shits, ainna
Bout big bro and bout that bread

[Verse]
I just left from Pompano
Lil bih head phenomenal
Might just pour up me ah four
Dawg be on the jigga though
Liquor got me moving slow
D got her walkin’ parrot-toed
System better free my woe
Pulled up at the liquor store
Know what I’m on the 40 though
Yeah I talk I’m from the 4
When I walk up you smell the dope
Something bout I don’t trust ah hoe
Neck and risk on eskimo
My lil bih she swollen though

[Chorus]
Ainna
Ainna

I be on my shh, ainna
We be wit da shh, ainna
Bout big bro and bout that bread
I’m coming off that hip, ainna

[Verse 2]
Treat me bih just like Jodeci
You on that dope don’t go to sleep
Lower than bih,  who ain’t lower of me than me
Took my dawg on ah shopping spree
No ten bih’s[???] ignoring me
100 grand ain’t nothing to me
Name that lil pussy Lovely
Got in my lil cut, it’s Easter pink
Keep it on my paranoid
Hatin’ on me you don’t know me boy
Drive my shit like a Tonka toy
Bank roll on me extra large
All this cash, no credit card
Whip it gotta whip it hard

Ainna
Ainna
Ainna

[Chorus]
I be on my shh, ainna
We be wit da shh, ainna
Bout big bro and bout that bread
I’m coming off that hip, ainna
