Yeen really on that, yeen really on that
Talk like you are bear, nigga
Yeen really on that
Take a bit through that
Yeen really on that
Pull up on a nigga ass

Run down on a bih
Yeen really on that
Yeen really on that
Yeen really on that
Nigga, yeen really on that
Yeen really on that
Nigga, yeen really on that
Yeen really on that

[Verse 1: Plies]
Real recognize, real, nigga, you don't look familiar
I heard a nigga took his chain, damn, go after your killers
If you're sweet then you're trash, blow that off the ripper
Bout mine bitch, I'm busting, niggas know that off the dribble
Everybody ain't pussy, everybody ain't killers
That's most you niggas flag to us, that's on the realer
Keep your mouf on pause and keep your finger on the trigger
How I feel bout the sippa da bitch try they gissin
My models will be fo me and fo bitch I'll really fix it
You got niggas that flag it and, you got niggas that live it
You ain't ready to go to war, you don't act like you will
You won't give bitch the issue, they don't talk like you will

[Verse 2: Plies]
He got the mouf of a gorilla, but got the heart of a puddle
He ain't really about that shit
That's why it's easy for a nigga to spook you
When you're out there in that water and you can't swim, shit get crucial
Why you out here with all that shoo shoo'n as niggas playing with ruger
And the shit I had to learn, them be the first one to sue ya
The same one that jump they ass on Twitter talk stupid!
Oh no, he ain't a burglar, oh no, he ain't a gangsta
That fuck niggas, that jus hurt
That pussy trying to get famous
I'm a help you out with that
Ole sweet cheese your ass
Drop dem young niggas off, and let em spazz on yo ass
They're trying to trick me off the streets
But a fuck nigga I ain't
Nigga feel lucky if he wanna but I'm a leave his ass stink!
