[Intro]
You better catch up
You better catch up
Better catch up
Why yo don't watching what I'm doing
Better catch up

[Chorus]
You just thought of having I been having you better catch up
I will rock in Atlanta some will better catch up
Why you watching me and what I'm doing you better catch up
Note to polly this is my accountant you better catch up
You just thought of having I been having you better catch up
I will rock in Atlanta some will better catch up
Why you watching me and what I'm doing you better catch up
Note to polly this is my accountant you better catch up

[Verse 1]
I just made a 100 Benz and ain't got asked for being here
Ask me could she be my lady I told her ain't got the hear yet
Everybody watching me I think they need binoculars
Bitches wanna rate the kid I guess because  I'm popular
Have you ever ran out of a whole flow in Vegas
No you never didi look bitch take some paper
All i gotta see though you can't find your 20 o's
I don't want a baby bitch I think I left some semen on her
Last time I went rubbing rubbing it's some ball name
Last time I witnessed jail a poly found a 100 grand
You be filing me so much you just like my shile
I can fuck yo baby woman over when she in town

[Chorus]
You just thought of having I been having you better catch up
I will rock in Atlanta some will better catch up
Why you watching me and what I'm doing you better catch up
Note to polly this is my accountant you better catch up
You just thought of having I been having you better catch up
I will rock in Atlanta some will better catch up
Why you watching me and what I'm doing you better catch up
Note to polly this is my accountant you better catch up

[Verse 2]
If you ain't worth no real paper you ain't my competition
You and me ain't beefing dog if you ain't came up miss
Eight figure nigga but I be still living in trenches
She be trying to get me play but on me getting attention
They ask me do I held a word by somebody robbing me
Keep the word on the bang I ain't worried about you bothered me
I just left the quarter line beef for nosing
I just dropped a bag and signed the paper I ain't even drove it

[Chorus]
You just thought of having I been having you better catch up
I will rock in Atlanta some will better catch up
Why you watching me and what I'm doing you better catch up
Note to polly this is my accountant you better catch up
You just thought of having I been having you better catch up
I will rock in Atlanta some will better catch up
Why you watching me and what I'm doing you better catch up
Note to polly this is my accountant you better catch up
