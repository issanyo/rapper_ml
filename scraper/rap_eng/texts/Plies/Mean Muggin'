[Intro]
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I got that thang on me, that's why I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I got that thang on me, that's why I'm mean muggin'

[Hook]
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I don't know you dawg, that's why...
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I stay clutchin' on that while I'm...
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I ain't tryin' to get to know ya...
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
Since you're staring like you know me, I'm mean muggin'

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'm strapped in the corner, nigga slide if he wanna
On an hour of sleep, then drunk a six o' Coronas
Bitches playin' on my phone, gotta switch up my number
That's why I don't fuck with 'er man, I told her--bitch, cause it's Tinder
I'm just leaving from Enterprise, had to switch up the rental
Niggas tryin' to peep it, gotta stay in somethin' different
Got me talkin' in code, and crackers probably listenin'
Say he know where the sweet was, I told him-- nigga, I ain't with it
Cause if the lick was so sweet, you wouldn't need me to get it
Word around town, me 'n' such and such beefin'
I ain't beef with that nigga, feel like that nigga pussy
I ain't payin' him shit, I told that nigga I took it

[Hook]
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I don't know you dawg, that's why...
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I stay clutchin' on that while I'm...
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I ain't tryin' to get to know ya...
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
Since you're staring like you know me...
I'm mean muggin'

[Verse 2]
I don’t know you like that, and I'm tryin t’ keep it like that
I ain't tryin t’ be friendly, and I ain't tryin t’ chit chat
I'm tryin t’ stay to myself, and keep that thang in my belt
I ain't tryin t’ be cool, I don't need you all in my ear
If I don't like what you stand for, keep that shit over there
If I ain't slidin' with my young niggas, I rock by my self
Keep them niggas out the space, don't want them all in my face
And if you size me it’s on, ‘cause I don't believe in mistakes
I'm bitin’ down and I’m ready, bitch try me and I'm clickin'
Clutchin' on it and all, on the handle I'm grippin'
I'm that boppin’ ‘n’ sippin', but I'm payin' attention
Got the extend-o on me, if he foolin’ he get it

[Hook]
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I don't know you dawg, that's why...
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I stay clutchin' on that while I'm...
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I ain't tryin' to get to know ya...
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
I'm mean muggin', I'm mean muggin'
Since you're staring like you know me...
I'm mean muggin'
