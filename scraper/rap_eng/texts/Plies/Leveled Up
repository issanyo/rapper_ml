[Verse 1]
If she ain't bad I'ma never date her
Growing up I would never hate her
Capping G I did a lot of favor
Boss shit I can elevate ya
Bad bitches I nominate ya
Went in jail I was a population
Packa watching that's an observation
Pack bitch a def of demonstration
Rack dope that's an honor statement
I'm in the street that's my congregation
Money dope my infatuation
May set me off my busting baby
Real niggas they appreciate me
Whole niggas gon soldier hate me
Lover boner in every occasion
Your tonsils I'm penetrating

[Chorus]
Switch hustles I'm leveled up
Doubled down I leveled up
Ground for I'm leveled up
Put in work I leveled up
Switch hustles I'm leveled up
Doubled down I leveled up
Ground for I'm leveled up
Put in work I leveled up
Switch hustles I'm leveled up
Doubled down I leveled up
Ground for I'm leveled up
Put in work I leveled up
Switch hustles I'm leveled up
Doubled down I leveled up
Ground for I'm leveled up
Put in work I leveled up

[Verse 2]
This is not about ya
Came up from a sky ya
Yolo homies are a pee on
Seen it before this is rewind
High stepping like I'm neon
Neck kohl like free on
I just had me a threesome
Broad day round three sun
Got the Julia Capri's on
Finesse and all for the beer on
Security guard on me why
Riding 'round with a beep-on
I wanna smoke gon been blind
Came all the way from free line
Cold sign they need one
Got the bag and I'ma keep watch

[Chorus]
Switch hustles I'm leveled up
Doubled down I leveled up
Ground for I'm leveled up
Put in work I leveled up
Switch hustles I'm leveled up
Doubled down I leveled up
Ground for I'm leveled up
Put in work I leveled up
Switch hustles I'm leveled up
Doubled down I leveled up
Ground for I'm leveled up
Put in work I leveled up
Switch hustles I'm leveled up
Doubled down I leveled up
Ground for I'm leveled up
Put in work I leveled up
