[Intro}
"Bih my family bruh, bih my niggas bruh
Man bitch off limits man
Any bitch I don't fuck with bruh
Man they gets it
Any bitch I don't fuck with gets it / (Ain't even proud of it)
But when it came to my family and friends I ain't never cross them
I ain't never cross them
I ain't never cross my family and my friends, (I ain't never cross them)."

[Hook]
"I ain't never cross them (Ain't never cross them)
I ain't never cross them (Ain't never cross them)
I ain't never cross them (Ain't never cross them)
I ain't never cross them (Ain't never cross them)
I done scammed me some niggas, I done took from a few
Alot niggas in my past I did alot of shit to
But I ain't never had love for the niggas I never knew
But when it came to my niggas them, I ain't never cross them."

[Verse 1]
"My partner was at my house and forgot his whole chicken
A week done went by and it wasn't a damn gram missing
Had plenty of chances to try em
I could of swiveled em in the kitchen
Could of took me a couple of them thangs when he wasn't looking
Done left plenty of racks of mine with dog and I wasn't tripping
Tried to teach my little cousin the same but he wouldn't listen
He fell in love with the money, thought it was all about the swiveling
Used to tell him all the time family and friends is off limits
But his attitude to me was any bitch could get it
Karma a motherfucker that was some shit I had to witness
The most important thing in this world to be is authentic
I wish he would of listened because his best friend killed him."

[Hook]
"I ain't never cross them (Ain't never cross them)
I ain't never cross them (Ain't never cross them)
I ain't never cross them (Ain't never cross them)
I ain't never cross them (Ain't never cross them)
I done scammed me some niggas, I done took from a few
Alot niggas in my past I did alot of shit to
But I ain't never had love for the niggas I never knew
But when it came to my niggas them, I ain't never cross them."

[Verse 2]
"Used to tell my click all the time, friendship all about value
Because somebody tell you they love you, don't mean that they'll spare you
Worst thing out here, is to get caught up in the rapture
Called my phone about his paper, I told him I didn't have it
He wasn't my friend, he wasn't my family
So to me it didn't even matter
Had to stay on point though because everybody serious about they cheddar
Wouldn't of had to even take it from him if my situation was a little better
But out here in this jungle it's alot of personal vendetta
He hadn't did shit to me, just caught me at a bad time
He just fronted me the package, and I just had done lost mine
Yea he did me a favor, I swear I appreciate it
But if my dog fronted me the work, I would of never contemplated."

[Hook]
"I ain't never cross them (Ain't never cross them)
I ain't never cross them (Ain't never cross them)
I ain't never cross them (Ain't never cross them)
I ain't never cross them (Ain't never cross them)
I done scammed me some niggas, I done took from a few
Alot niggas in my past I did alot of shit to
But I ain't had love for the niggas I never knew
But when it came to my niggas them, I ain't never cross them."

[Outro]
"I ain't never cross them (never cross them)
(couldn't even do it if I wanted to)
I ain't never cross them
(it mean too much to me, it mean to much to me)
I ain't never cross them
I ain't never cross them
I ain't never cross them
(never cross them)
I ain't never cross them
(never cross them)
