[Intro: Plies]
Yeah, go ahead and take that off
I could look at you and tell that pussy everything
Plies, Slip-N-Slide Records

[Chorus]
There's a right and a wrong way to fuck me, baby
A right way to fuck me, baby
You love me right, oh-oh-oh
There's a right and a wrong way to fuck me, baby
A right way to fuck me, baby
You love me right, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Plies]
I've been hustling all day, I'm fresh out the streets
Last thing I need is somebody who don't know how to fuck me
Want you to give it to me, baby, until we fall asleep
And leave the lights on for me 'cause I like to peek
I wanna look at your face while you're riding me
And when you slide down on it, baby, go deep
You breathing hard, your legs shaking 'cause they getting weak
I got you moanin now 'cause you can't speak
I got you so wet, you leaking on the sheets
Want you to slow it down for me, I ain't ready to skeet
And I can stay here all night with you on top on me
Two freaks together, baby, this how it's supposed to be

[Chorus]
There's a right and a wrong way to fuck me, baby
A right way to fuck me, baby
You love me right, oh-oh-oh
There's a right and a wrong way to fuck me, baby
A right way to fuck me, baby
You love me right, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Plies]
Lay on your stomach for me and push that ass up
And just relax for me let me do all the work
But when I say throw it, just make that ass twerk
And I ain't gon' punish you right now, I'ma take it easy first
I don't want you to run from me so I'ma grab your curves
And I'ma stay back here, baby, until you catch yours
I know I'm in you good 'cause I just felt you jerk
And how you moan, I don't know if it feel good or if it hurt
But how you throwing it at me, I know it's a good hurt
Just watching your ass move, it make me wanna burst
But I already told you I'ma let you cum first
And as we speak, baby, sound like you cumming, girl
Now, baby, hold on while I beat you, girl
Go on ahead and let it go, I see your toes curl
And now you're shaking, baby, I know it's over, girl
Now we done both came, we in our own world

[Chorus]
There's a right and a wrong way to fuck me, baby
A right way to fuck me, baby
You love me right, oh-oh-oh
There's a right and a wrong way to fuck me, baby
A right way to fuck me, baby
You love me right, oh-oh-oh

[Outro: Plies]
I told you, the only thing you had to do was give the pussy to a real nigga
I told you, I got you, baby
Plies and Slip-N-Slide Records
Another classic, baby
