(Intro)
Yea, they say time fly, (know what they say)
I guess it do, when you and your bitch doing time (believe that)

(Hook) x3
Welcome home Boosie, welcome home Boosie
Don't let these fuck niggas out here fool ya
Welcome home Boosie, welcome home Boosie
Now they need to free C-Murder, BG, Meech and Gucci

(Verse 1)
The first rap nigga to say ''Welcome home Boosie''
Was the same rap nigga who ain't say shit to Boosie
Gonna holla free something, how bout freeing your dogs
How about freeing that same nigga that you don't talk to at all
