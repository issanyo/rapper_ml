Nigga told me damn, my nigga, everything got here by self
I told him I don’t give a damn how you get it, how you got it
You ain’t get it by yourself
If your soldiers ain’t eating, you the only one eating
They ain’t riding for you no more
That’s the shit, go to liquor, nigga, go to liquor fine, but they ain’t really wrong, though
If they go to war, nigga, if they die for you, nigga, they supposed to eat, too
And if they are on the frontline with you, my nigga, them nigga brought the ball, too
Hold up, my nigga, hold up, my nigga, don’t get all to your all
But when the time go to war, my nigga, you can’t call them to ride with you all

Keep it real with your people dem
You eat, they eat, you shine, they shine
Keep it real with your people dem
They hold you down, you hold them back
Keep it real with your people dem
They ride, you ride, you ride, they ride
Keep it real with your people dem
Keep it real with your people dem
Keep it real with your people dem
You eat, they eat, you shine, they shine
Keep it real with your people dem
They hold you down, you hold them back
Keep it real with your people dem
They ride, you ride, you ride, they ride
Keep it real with your people dem
Keep it real with your people dem
Keep it real with your people dem

Every time I think I seen it all, a motherfucker show me something else
I wanna show you that you really for your niggas, them the ones that you really supposed to help
Not the ones that you just met, hoes you wanna fuck, ain’t talking about them
I’m talking about the ones when it goes down you can pick up the phone and call them
And you know that they coming, they ain’t asking no questions, they gonna ride to the end
And if you lose it all tomorrow then the same motherfucker, he’ll be calling up again
If you say that is love then it’s love, my nigga, be a man of your word
If I’m showing you love, my nigga, give me the same damn thing

Keep it real with your people dem
You eat, they eat, you shine, they shine
Keep it real with your people dem
They hold you down, you hold them back
Keep it real with your people dem
They ride, you ride, you ride, they ride
Keep it real with your people dem
Keep it real with your people dem
Keep it real with your people dem
You eat, they eat, you shine, they shine
Keep it real with your people dem
They hold you down, you hold them back
Keep it real with your people dem
They ride, you ride, you ride, they ride
Keep it real with your people dem
Keep it real with your people dem
Keep it real with your people dem
