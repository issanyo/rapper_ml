[Intro]
She my Bust it baby [6x]

1st time we had sex, it was like a movies
Both of us fell asleep, both of us was woozy
Love how she say my name, love how she do me
Gained feelings for her kinda quick, kinda blew me
Found myself thinking bout her, shit kinda spooked me
More time we spent together more she got attached
I love being around her, seem like the perfect match
She ain't blow my phone up and she ain't never hack
She knew her place, played her role, and she was cool with that
"What you doin" "Where you goin" questions she don't ask
She took my mind off the streets she helped me relax
She wanted to VIP her face she put me on my back

[Chorus (2x)]
Her sex game crazy
Body so amazing
Kiss like she cravin
Walk like she taken
Attitude mistaken
Fiend for her daily
Care about her greatly
Why she my bust it baby

What we did last night got me wantin to call her
If I wasn't real homie I'd probably stalk her
From the hood, when she get drunk she talk proper
Got kinky with her, told her dress up like a lawyer
I was the judge last night I gave her all the orders
Worked it real good turned her round and doggystyled her
Told her if I gave her any more might have to charge her
Felt the vibe in the room the feelings getting larger
Took her from the bench and I done turned her to a starter
Tastes like sugar, smell like water
Now she into goons all off what I taught her
What I do to her make her care about me harder

[Chorus (2x)]
Her sex game crazy
Body so amazing
Kiss like she cravin
Walk like she taken
Attitude mistaken
Fiend for her daily
Care about her greatly
Why she my bust it baby

[Outro]
She my Bust it baby [6x]
