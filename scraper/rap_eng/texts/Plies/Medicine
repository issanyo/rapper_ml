Baby, if you don't feel good right now
And yo' body hurtin' you right now
You just need a shot of me
I'm just like medicine

Shawty, I'm your insulin
Baby, I'm your insulin
I think ya need, I think ya need
I think ya need your medicine

Baby, I'm your insulin
Shawty, I'm your insulin
I think ya need, I think ya need
I think ya need your medicine

I'll be your prescription
Come and take a dose of me
Once you get a dose of me
You'll think that I'm your medicine

Shawty you my medicine, your medicine
I think I need, I think I need
I think I need my medicine

One teaspoon of me is something like a pack of blow
Too much of me too fast and you'll overdose
Treat you like a newborn baby, I'll feed ya slow
And if I really fuck with ya I'll give you a double dose

I'm yo' lil' double stack, pop me you'll really roll
Nighttime, daytime, I can give it to ya both
Anytime you want it, I can give it to ya that's for sure
Keep ya up all night I can be you No Doz

Need yo' prescription filled? Holla at me, let me know
Call me or text me, baby, when you need some mo'
I give you Becky, baby, when ya body sore
This is exclusive, you can't buy this in the store

Shawty, I'm your insulin
Baby, I'm your insulin
I think ya need, I think ya need
I think ya need your medicine

Baby, I'm your insulin
Shawty, I'm your insulin
I think ya need, I think ya need
I think ya need your medicine

I'll be your prescription
Come and take a dose of me
Once you get a dose of me
You'll think that I'm your medicine

Shawty you my medicine, my medicine, your medicine
I think I need, I think I need
I think I need my medicine

I can shoot you anywhere, ain't gotta put it in yo' veins
Within the first two seconds, you will feel the change
Only discomfort that you might feel is good pain
One side effect of this medicine is butt-gain

A half a dose of me and I promise you won't be the same
Addiction to this medicine is common, don't be ashamed
And if you feel a lil' woozy after this just hold my hand
And I can numb yo' whole body just like Novocaine

I can make you come back, you can call me cocaine
And if you take this first dose good, I'mma up yo' range
On yo' prescription, it will read Plies name
The rest of yo' life, you will not accept no lames

Shawty, I'm your insulin
Baby, I'm your insulin
I think ya need, I think ya need
I think ya need your medicine

Baby, I'm your insulin
Shawty, I'm your insulin
I think ya need, I think ya need
I think ya need your medicine

I'll be your prescription
Come and take a dose of me
Once you get a dose of me
You'll think that I'm your medicine

Shawty you my medicine, my medicine, your medicine
I think I need, I think I need
I think I need my medicine

Call me when you feel bad, call me on yo' sick day
And I'll swing through and make sure yo' fever go away
I can make you sweat it out, sweat on me it's ok
Don't worry bout ya hair getting messed up it's ok

I'll get it redone for you, baby, I'll pay
And if it's top notch and it feel good, I'll stay
I drink straight 'Gnac, me no ros√©
You want it, say I need my medicine that's all you gotta say

Shawty, I'm your insulin
Baby, I'm your insulin
I think ya need, I think ya need
I think ya need your medicine

Baby, I'm your insulin
Shawty, I'm your insulin
I think ya need, I think ya need
I think ya need your medicine

I'll be your prescription
Come and take a dose of me
Once you get a dose of me
You'll think that I'm your medicine

Shawty you my medicine, my medicine, your medicine
I think I need, I think I need
I think I need my medicine
