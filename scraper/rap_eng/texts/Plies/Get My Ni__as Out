Hey homie mortherfuckers allwas askin' me
Why I ain't never happy when they see me
Why I ain't never smile about non' I tell them motherfuckers
'Cause I got to get my niggas out
Gotta bring my nigga home
Got to get my niggas out
Can let my niggas sit
Can let my niggas rot
Got to get my niggas out
Got to get my niggas out
Got to get my niggas out
Got to get my niggas out
These niggas shot for me when I was broke they help me out
Got to get my niggas out
Got to get my niggas out
Got to get my niggas out
Got to get my niggas out
Some of my niggas grown op the wrong
Some of my niggas in the captain jail
Some of my niggas still waitin' trial
Some of niggas just call to ail
Some of my niggas is just what is
Some my niggas been written hell
And of my niggas just got a bon'
And some of my niggas don't got a pel'
And some of my niggas in for murder charche
Some of my niggas try to catch a sell
And some of my niggas is cut op in the trial
And some of my niggas is fucked up them self
But all my partner straight G
And I'm them niggas who never tell
I fuck with my niggas hard
So I got to get my niÂ­ggas hell
I can't let my niggas sit
'cause that ain't what real niggas do
I got to bring my niggas home
'Cause that ain't how I know I fuck with you all
My niggas hoes tied and all my niggas hold your head
'Cause I'm gonna bring my niggas home a minute gone
From what I fucking said
