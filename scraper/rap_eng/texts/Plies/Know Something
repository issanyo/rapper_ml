[Chorus]
All these niggas you see me with, they know something
And all these niggas you see me with, they toting something
And all these niggas you see me with, they on something
And I only fuck with niggas, dog, that'll murk something
So all these niggas you see me with, they know something
And all these niggas you see me with, they toting something
And all these niggas you see me with, they on something
And I only fuck with niggas, dog, that'll murk something

[Verse 1]
I got the mind of a millionaire, the heart of a broke nigga
And got the motherfucking patience of a young nigga
You an associate, not a homie if you don't squeeze triggers
'Cause I refuse to get seen with a soft ass nigga
You either 'bout it or you ain't, there ain't nothing in the middle
You either buss it or you won't, old pussy ass nigga
I been learned that a fuck nigga will get you killed
That's why I fuck with niggas I know buss off the rip
You live once, not twice, ain't no room to slip
'Cause one fuck up in these streets will get you buried quick
Nigga better know something, I don't fuck with dead weight
You ain't 'bout that gangsta, don't want you around in the first place
'Cause all my dogs still powder and gun smokers
Mine always on taking something from a motherfucker
Been wiped the smile off my face 'cause I ain't friendly
I'm talking closed casket shit, I ain't bullshiting

[Chorus]
All these niggas you see me with, they know something
And all these niggas you see me with, they toting something
And all these niggas you see me with, they on something
And I only fuck with niggas, dog, that'll murk something
So all these niggas you see me with, they know something
And all these niggas you see me with, they toting something
And all these niggas you see me with, they on something
And I only fuck with niggas, dog, that'll murk something

[Verse 2]
I fuck with certified murkers, run with real goons
Get out first and keep dumping, that's the attitude
I try my best to put one of you pussy niggas on the news
Put a hundred rounds in you, knock your insides loose
Skied up in all back, down to the shoes
And all can you see is the white in my eyes when I move
Shoot to kill, not to scare, that's a street rule
And never tote around something that you won't use
And never talk about shit that you won't do
And ask the city 'bout us, pussy nigga, we trap flow
Shoot it up, then shut it down, nigga looking for you
And you can't get no more money until the beef over
'Cause the shit I'm aiming at, right above the shoulders
Shooting big shit, it's coming like a fucking boulder
You think it's a game if you wanna, pussy, then I'll show you
This shit chess, not checkers, already done told you

[Chorus]
All these niggas you see me with, they know something
And all these niggas you see me with, they toting something
And all these niggas you see me with, they on something
And I only fuck with niggas, dog, that'll murk something
So all these niggas you see me with, they know something
And all these niggas you see me with, they toting something
And all these niggas you see me with, they on something
And I only fuck with niggas, dog, that'll murk something

[Verse 3]
Talking and not being 'bout it will get you knocked off
And playing with a real nigga, dog, that shit costs
And I ain't the nigga you play with, boy, I'm 'bout results
Now the question is, nigga, if you can walk the walk
Oh, any nigga can talk thug when the lights off
But when them lights come on, nigga, that's what it's all about
You niggas better start thinking before you open your mouth
These streets shit way deeper than you think it's 'bout
I'ma put you up on something, nigga: the streets don't sleep
That hundred-round drum, pimping, that's a lot of heat
You better ask around, nigga, that'll stop your heartbeat
It ain't a nigga God made I'ma let play with me

[Chorus]
All these niggas you see me with, they know something
And all these niggas you see me with, they toting something
And all these niggas you see me with, they on something
And I only fuck with niggas, dog, that'll murk something
So all these niggas you see me with, they know something
And all these niggas you see me with, they toting something
And all these niggas you see me with, they on something
And I only fuck with niggas, dog, that'll murk something

[Outro]
And I only fuck with niggas, dog, that'll murk something
And I only fuck with niggas, dog, that'll murk something
And I only fuck with niggas, dog, that'll murk something
And I only fuck with niggas, dog, that'll murk something
