[Chorus: Jacquees]
Six missed calls on my cell phone
She blowing me up, she said she need it right now
I just got back in town, she been feindin' all day
When we first started fucking, told you we would be this way
Just know I'm on my way to pound it out
Beat it up, slow it down
I'll fuck you all over the house, babe
All over the couch
Anywhere, everywhere, I'm on my way

[Verse 1: Plies]
I just got yo' text message
Got me over her rockin' up
I just finished my last drank
Got me over here packing up
I know when you texting me
You be really wanting me
Call you Bill Belichick, you bring out the best in me
I don't care what they say about ya
You a dime piece to me
All that and a bag of chips
Girl you got the recipe
I just want you next to me
I just love yo' company
Sweet pussy Satday baby
That's you everyday of the week to me

[Chorus: Jacquees]
Six missed calls on my cell phone
She blowing me up, she said she need it right now
I just got back in town, she been feindin' all day
When we first started fucking, told you we would be this way
Just know I'm on my way to pound it out
Beat it up, slow it down
I'll fuck you all over the house, babe
All over the couch
Anywhere, everywhere, I'm on my way

[Verse 2: Plies]
You know you that baby, got yo' shit together
Miss me, you been stressin'
I just wanna bless ya
I just wanna make ya horse
Punch ya till ya lose ya voice
Put that bath and body on ya, help ya' keep ya skin moist
I just wanna show ya' thangs, talkin' millionaire shit
Talkin' sunset drive, shop till ya drop shit
I just like the boss in you, treat you how bosses do
I'm on my way baby, come to drop that raw in you

[Chorus: Jacquees]
Six missed calls on my cell phone
She blowing me up, she said she need it right now
I just got back in town, she been feindin' all day
When we first started fucking, told you we would be this way
Just know I'm on my way to pound it out
Beat it up, slow it down
I'll fuck you all over the house, babe
All over the couch
Anywhere, everywhere, I'm on my way
