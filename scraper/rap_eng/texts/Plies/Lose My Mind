Lets get it shawty!
Oh this that shit right here nigga
What's up? What's up?
103 yo, nigga 103, yo!
When this shit drop in the club nigga
Yeah, it go, it go

[Refrain]
Why y'all trip
I'm just fine
12:45, bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drink like a tank, lose my mind
This shit cray, way too bad
Rosé baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
I'm hearin' voices in my head, think I'm schizo-frantic
I swear they sayin', let's get it from another planet
36, a thousand times, I'm doing somersaults
Do it right and you can live your whole Summer raw
I'm out my mind, yea a nigga seeing double y'all
Now tell me whats the chance of Jizzle fuckin' both of y'all?
She said "as long as we can do it with your ice on"
If that's the case, we might as well leave the lights on
I'm out my mind, just blew a thousand Swisher Sweets
In my black-and-orange Charger: call it Trick or Treat
It ain't nothing to a boss: my goons got goons
House stupid dumb big: my rooms got rooms

[Refrain]
Why y'all trip
I'm just fine
12:45, bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drink like a tank, lose my mind
This shit cray, way too bad
Rosé baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind

[Verse 2 - Plies]
Guess what my momma told me, she hate my partners
Guess why she hate em though
Cause all of em robbin'
Fuck the police, cause all of them problems
White girls fun, cause all of them swallow
Why I ain't fuck her at the house
Cause the bitch hollered
And where the pill man at
She need a blue dolphin
Old broke-ass nigga: stop cock-blockin'
Security, I need help cause the bitch stalkin'
A half fuckin' mil', that's what the whip cost me
100 dollars: that's what the pussy cost me
And when the nigga start hating, that's when the nigga lost me
"Fantastico," that's what the hoes - that's what the hoes call me

[Refrain]
Why y'all trip
I'm just fine
12:45, bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drink like a tank, lose my mind
This shit cray, way too bad
Rosé baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind

[Verse 3 - Jeezy]
Drop the top, no bra, got her titties out
Mention my name and bring the whole city out
Doing what I do best: d-boy stuntin'
New car, old money, d-boy stuntin'
Step in cleaner then a new Glock-40
Nickname in the A, strapped up shorty
You know my nerves bad, trigger like a toothpick
Line wrapped around the corner, boy too big
G-Code, black shades and my black chains
But if you wouldn't understand, it's a black thing
You know we drink that Rosé til we black out
Wake up, drink some more, pass back out
