[Chorus: Duece Poppi]
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy

[Verse 1: Duece Poppi]
Look way, way, way deep south, boy
Hoes, clothes, and bankrolls what we 'bout, boy
I'm from the home of the chrome and the chopper triggers
Even them alphabet boys can't stop a nigga
I pimp tight with that hoe off in the wind, boy
I gets loose like I'm fresh up out that pen, boy
The last of a dying breed like 'Pac said
I got bread, got something that'll cock it
My ambitions as a rider by Slip-n-Slide, uh
All them killers down south know I'm on fire
28's chrome, fuck a hundred, smoke [?]
I know you pimp tight, pimpin', but I pimp tighter
Getting bread, got it made like Special Ed
Them hollow tips at your head, bitch, I bet you dead
24's on the Wagon, that's that G Benz
Two 44's looking like Siamese twins

[Chorus: Duece Poppi]
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
See, I'ma get this money
Rich everywhere and however it goes
And let me tell you something
If you owe me money, might as well owe the double-yo
So see, JAY-Z and JD might have told you money ain't a thing
But that means money's everything and for that money y'all make, them choppers sing
I'll make them coppers bring
That yellow tape 'cause the whole thing
Can turn into a homicide scene if you fuck with the cream, mane
And I know Trick
And I know his click
But I let you slip, I let you slide
But I hope you motherfuckers don't think I'ma let you die
Surprise, Pitbull get the last laugh
And whoever laughs last laughs the hardest
Whether now or later, y'all gonna pay me back regardless

[Interlude: Pitbull]
And y'all can take THAT to the bank, motherfuckers

[Chorus: Duece Poppi]
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy

[Verse 3: Plies]
Nigga, I'm from down here where everything fucked up
And every other month, the dope prices going up
And either you thugging down here or you in the church
'Cause how I'm living, ain't nothing like you see on BET
These crackers found five dead in the last week
So if you a pussy nigga, you better get the fuck out these streets
These young niggas 16 and 17 going Fed
These crackers hitting these young niggas with 20-year bids
How the fuck you get indicted? You never had a quarter brick
But down here, that's how these pussy crackers play shit
And where I'm from, we respect Chevys more than we do Bentleys
'Cause a motherfucking Bentley can't fit them 26's
And that money come a little faster out here in the south
We got the corner, nigga, and got our own dope house
And you can find me with a white tee with my pants dropped
With four at the bottom, pussy nigga, and four at the top

[Chorus: Duece Poppi]
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
