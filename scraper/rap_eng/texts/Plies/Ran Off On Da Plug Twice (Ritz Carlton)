[Intro]
I don't know what I wanna call this bih
Bih call this bih ummm...
Call this bih ummm...
Name this bih ummmm...
Ritz Carlton, bih
We recordin' this bih in the Ritz Carlton right now, ain’t I?

[Verse 1]
Fuck a shooter, I'm my own shooter
All this ice, I'm my own jeweler
Six lawyers and they're all Jewish
I'm the star, bitch, this my movie
Pinky ring, two-fifty on it
Guess it's safe to say, nigga I spent your budget on it
Ran off on da plug twice
He's steady callin', I ain't callin' back
He said he dissed me on his last album
Guess nobody heard cause nobody bought his last album
I got a Delta, go to Howard
That little pwussy got some power
Born broke but Imma die rich
Lot of these fuck niggas counterfeit

[Hook]
I'm just vibin' in the Ritz Carlton
Got the stick, all in Ritz Carlton
Count a mil' right in Ritz Carlton
Wanna fuck me, baby? Pull up at the Ritz Carlton
I'm just vibin' in the Ritz Carlton
Got the stick, all in Ritz Carlton
Count a mil' right in Ritz Carlton
Wanna fuck me, baby? Pull up at the Ritz Carlton

[Verse 2]
Everything on me brand new
Call her a mangler cause she ran through
Say she want me to take the rubber off
Told her people in Hell want ice water bitch knock it off
All the cribs came with elevators
Old schools painted same colors as Now & Laters
Said if you ain't got haters you ain't poppin nigga
I don't rap beef, let's shoot it out, that's how I'm rockin', nigga
Trap money, made six figures
If you're thuggin' out you better keep a rocket with ya'
In front of Neiman's in a black Jag
Told her if the head fire, swear I’ll buy her a new ass
I spend money for the fuck of it
I stay flushin' for the rush of it
I wanna have me 'bout ten kids
Give 'em a mil' apiece and tell 'em, "Now do what your daddy did!"

[Hook]
I'm just vibin' in the Ritz Carlton
Got the stick, all in Ritz Carlton
Count a mil' right in Ritz Carlton
Wanna fuck me, baby? Pull up at the Ritz Carlton
I'm just vibin' in the Ritz Carlton
Got the stick, all in Ritz Carlton
Count a mil' right in Ritz Carlton
Wanna fuck me, baby? Pull up at the Ritz Carlton
