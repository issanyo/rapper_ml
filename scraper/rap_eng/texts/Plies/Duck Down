[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. (Sampled), Trick Daddy & Both]
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
Ni-ni-ni-ni-nigga, we don't fuck around, nigga, we don't fuck around
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down

[Verse 1: Trick Daddy]
And if he don't know, y'all better let him know
My niggas got .40s, if they bring them out, they gon' let them go
Imagine 36 rounds plus 36 more
Counting his head, chest, and car doors, that's 72 fucking holes
And if his homies act up, then that's what the MAC for
They get one warning shot and then after that, fire, (shut him up)
If you're riding with him, fuck nigga, you're dying with him
You can run and hide, but in a matter of time, oh, I'll get him
And the first sight of him, I'll put that light on him
And every red dot is gon' turn them into blood clots
First, it's gon' be heavy bleeding
And then his eyes gon' roll to the back of his head, his pulse weak and he's barely breathing
Ain't no hollerin' "Red Rock"
You done already used up your wish, bitch, all you get is headshots
So when the MAC sound, niggas better duck down
I'm from Dade County, nigga, we don't fuck around

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. (Sampled), Trick Daddy & Both]
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
Ni-ni-ni-ni-nigga, we don't fuck around, nigga, we don't fuck around
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down

[Verse 2: Plies]
I'm talking four goons hanging out of four windows
With four choppers going off, all at one nigga
With 50 shots a piece, if we don't kill you, God was with you
So when you hear that (toot-toot-toot-toot), that mean it's official
And down here, it ain't money, choppers the main gesture
The streets the wrong place to hang when you got that thing with you
The only choppers I buy the ones with soft triggas
So when I squeeze that motherfucker, I know I'm gon' hit you
So if your money ain't right, better keep your mouth closed
'Cause when you're beefing in these streets, your trap gotta close
And where we see your pussy ass at, we're letting them go
Trash bags over the choppers so no shells hit the floor
You ain't got to be here to see it, but I'll bet you hear about it
Four niggas ski'ed up in all black, straight wilding
Them niggas let down them windows, them choppas went to hollering
Them niggas road off busting and left folks thumping

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. (Sampled), Trick Daddy & Both]
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
Ni-ni-ni-ni-nigga, we don't fuck around, nigga, we don't fuck around
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G. (Sampled)]
Motherfuckers thought I slipped, right?
You didn't know the extra clips on my hip, right?
Ricochet off the vertebrae, dead splat
Now starts the cardiac arrest, where's your vest?
You forgot, now you slowly dropped 'cause your heart stopped beating
Your bitch ass crew is retreating
Niggas left you fucked up. passed out with your ass out
Pockets ran through, stripped with your brains bashed out

[Verse 4: Trick Daddy]
Tell me, have you ever seen
Less bone fragments or remains of a man that's been slain by one of them things?
Laying way ten feet away from his brain
Holding his kidneys and his hands and pissed and shitted all in his pants?
Laying there, dead in his own blood
And I can't even explain how big the hole in his head was
So gonâ€™ ahead and yellow tape it
Quarantine the scene, nobody leaves until they mark all the shell cases

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. (Sampled), Trick Daddy & Both]
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
Ni-ni-ni-ni-nigga, we don't fuck around, nigga, we don't fuck around
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
Ni-ni-ni-ni-nigga, we don't fuck around, nigga, we don't fuck around
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
