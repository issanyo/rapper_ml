[Chorus]
Ever since I met this girl I'll never be the same
I say excuse me, nice to meet you, can I get your name
'Cuz I'm in love with you-oo-oo
And she told me that she love me too-oo-oo
(What you talkin' 'bout) I'm talkin bout VaJayJay!
Bartender give me your number, my love won't save me
I'm about to shut it down spend money on my baby
Nice lips, soft lips I'm in love with VaJayJay (Oh I'm so in love with VaJayJay)

[Verse 1: Plies]

I don't lift weights, ain't got the six pack
But everything I done hit I can come back
I just like to tap her when she wake up
I just like to kiss her on her [?]
I love VaJayJay she a biter
She don't lay down she a fighter
I don't play two-hand touch I play tackle
Favorite way when she ride that thing backwards
Tight tight no loose loose
When that thing get wet look like Grey Goose
When I die bury VaJayJay on top of me
I just love the way VaJayJay talk to me

[Chorus]

Bathwater, drink it all
Hit it good, make it talk
Ten ainna, dime piece
Shotgun (where she at), front seat
[?] order, that's me
Good good, lovalyy
Where she ride, A/C
Who paid, just me
Shawty ain't coach, shawty first class
Shawty ain't stiff, shawty throw it back
Shawty ain't got no aroma
I'll marry VaJayJay in the morning

[Chorus]
