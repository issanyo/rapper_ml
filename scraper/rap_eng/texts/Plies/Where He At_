[Intro]
Ay, man, y'all niggas already know what it is with me, dog
I done showed these fuck niggas one time, homie
I ain't nothing to be fucked up with, dog
I done showed y'all niggas who the realest nigga in this shit, my nigga
I'm coming 'round the second time, nigga
To get everything that I've missed the first time around, fuck nigga
And you can't do nothing 'bout it, pussy ass nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm one of the young niggas get on pills and listen to
And ride till five in the morning while I [?]
I keep this shit from a real nigga point of view
And tell you what a real nigga in these streets supposed to do
Quote me on it, ain't no rap nigga I look up to
I look up to street niggas whose lives I know true
Two doing forty 'cause snitching's something they wouldn't do
I don't judge niggas off talking, I judge them off proof
So do me a favor and watch who you compare me to
'Cause he might be a fuck nigga to me and he might be real to you
'Cause I ain't never had dreams of being on Rap City
Plus I was too busy being the man in my city
I'm not a rapper, homie, that's what you is
I'm just a real nigga, dog, that the streets feel
A hundred percent G-code, the streets made me real
They say the cream rise to the top, that's how I feel

[Chorus]
You say you know a nigga realer than Plies, then where he at?
'Cause I watched BET like you and I ain't seen him yet
Been figured out this rap shit, where all the fuck niggas at?
And the realest nigga in this shit, you can quote me on that
You say you know a nigga realer than Plies, well, where he at?
'Cause I watched BET like you and I ain't seen him yet
Been figured out this rap shit, where all the fuck niggas at?
And the realest nigga in this shit, you can quote me on that

[Verse 2]
I'm in a category by myself, I stand alone
You niggas just good with words, I touch niggas in my songs
I speak for that nigga in prison who life's gone
Who doing fifty years 'cause he the nigga they told on
They didn't give him life, so that's the only reason he holding on
I speak for that young wild nigga that's out here thugging
And all he want is respect, so he out here, chopper bussing
Mom and dad ain't shit, the streets the only thing love him
Put a real nigga around some fuck niggas, watch him stand out
And that's what's happening with me and this rap shit now
And while you're trying to get hot, pussy, I'm on fire
I'm getting a quarter for a show without a video, boy

[Chorus]
You say you know a nigga realer than Plies, then where he at?
'Cause I watched BET like you and I ain't seen him yet
Been figured out this rap shit, where all the fuck niggas at?
And the realest nigga in this shit, you can quote me on that
You say you know a nigga realer than Plies, well, where he at?
'Cause I watched BET like you and I ain't seen him yet
Been figured out this rap shit, where all the fuck niggas at?
And the realest nigga in this shit, you can quote me on that

[Verse 3]
I got hot on my own, I ain't need a cosigner
'Cause when your music real, pussy nigga, the streets find you
The streets believe or they don't, no such thing as kind of
A rookie at this shit, but doing big boy numbers
This ain't what I fucking do, nigga, I'm a street rida'
Just learned how to count bars, that's just a reminder
Something about being a real nigga, you can't deny him
I made the real niggas proud when I told them I got them
These my streets now, if you want them, pussy, buy them back
But you don't sell nothing, nigga, when your money right
I'm a hoe's fantasy, nigga, and a promoter's dream
And real niggas love me 'cause we done been through the same thing

[Chorus]
You say you know a nigga realer than Plies, then where he at?
'Cause I watched BET like you and I ain't seen him yet
Been figured out this rap shit, where all the fuck niggas at?
And the realest nigga in this shit, you can quote me on that
You say you know a nigga realer than Plies, well, where he at?
'Cause I watched BET like you and I ain't seen him yet
Been figured out this rap shit, where all the fuck niggas at?
And the realest nigga in this shit, you can quote me on that
