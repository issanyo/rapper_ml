A car full of choppas (and eerybody quiet)
A car full of goons (and eerybody certified)
And if you froze up last time you can't ride (can't ride)
It's goin down tonight cause these goons out lurkin'
A car full of choppas (and eerybody quiet)
A car full of goons (and eerybody certified)
And if you froze up last time you can't ride (can't ride)
It's goin down tonight cause these goons out lurkin'

[Verse 1]
Five in the mornin', ain't nobody out but us
And eerybody sleep but we finna wake the city up
And finna teach you pussy niggas bout playin wit us
We find yo duck ass t'nite lil' homie you outta luck
And he don't know we comin', finna get his life took
We ridin' bin ladin shit, a hundred rounds plus
Before he went to sleep he ain't know he wouldn't be wakin up
It's already understood, these crackas get behind us flush
And we ain't coming home, till all the clips empty
And we ain't shootin up no house, it draw too much attenion
We catch yo ass comin out, lil' homie you get's it
I bet one muthafuckin thang nigga we ain't missin

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You mighta missed the news, but you gone make the news
Victim found face down, knocked him out his shoes
Dem choppas went off he tried to run but couldn't move
Sawed him in half, that choppa broke him down in two
Everything them hollow points hit knocked 'em loose
We want your homeboy's naw pussy we ain't thru
Dem crackers found a hundred holes, but ain't got a clue
Now eerybody claim they know who fucked over you
A big mouth don't get you shit, but a big funeral
And a bunch of muthafuckas cryin' who claiming they knew ya
You can't bring him back, stop ya crying the pussy dead
He shoulda kept his mouth closed, he ain't know how to play it

[Hook]

Cause these goons out lurkin...
