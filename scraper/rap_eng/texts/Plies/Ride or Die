[Intro: Plies]
You know the best thing going is to have a ride or die right
She a ride or die, she a ride or die, ride or die, ride or die
Shit she a ride or die boy you better cuff her
She a ride or die, she a ride or die, she a ride or die, she a ride or die

[Hook: Plies]
I hope it don’t happen but if it did I know she gonna hold me down
Pick up the phone and send me mail
(Why) Cuz she a ride or die, she a ride or die
Cuz she a ride or die, she a ride or die
And If somebody round me did try to holla I ain’t gotta worry ‘bout it
Cuz lil momma ain’t doing nothing you know what I’m sayin
Cuz she a ride or die, cuz she a ride or die
Cuz she a ride or die, cuz she a ride or die

[Verse 1: Plies]
Love fucking with lil momma she a diamond in the rough
A lot of niggas gonna holla don’t mean a nigga gonna fuck
Baby girl been the shit, it ain’t no pressure to her
You got a ride or die dawg what you stressing her for
And what I love about baby she ain’t new to the game
She ain’t caught up in the whips and all the material things
She a solider like me so she can do what she do
And if you ride for her then shit she ride for you
She might cuff a lil bit but she don’t need that shit
She can shut it down tomorrow don’t even miss that shit
She can get money chill dawg and stay in the house
Know when I need her she on point cuz she my ride or die

[Hook: Plies]
You know why niggas sometimes close to ya get creeps
Tryin to bag her or shoot at her and see if she cheat
All I could tell ya dawg if you get it you good
I ain’t gotta tell ya you creepin’ she gonna say it to ya first
She will ride for a nigga hold it down for a nigga
Now if shit get tricky she will lie for a nigga
Anything else besides that my nigga what else do you want
She don’t gotta call me all day I don’t care if she don’t
Know she good anyway cuz the pussy ain’t worn
She gonna be the first number I call if I go to the joint
Soon as I tell her what the play is I’m sure she gon’ slide
We dun been thru it before so I know she gon’ ride

[Hook: Plies]

[Verse 3: Plies]
Ain’t gotta give game ‘bout nothing bae solid
Ain’t gotta tell her how she need to act bae got it
Ain’t time for no shit she ain’t tapping mine
Ain’t all in her business she ain’t all in mine
Ain’t have to tell about love that shit in her blood
Ain’t have to teach her how to ride she was already good
And on a scale from one to ten she a ten outta ten
Gotta ride or die nigga betta lock on in
