[Intro: Future]
All these chains that I'm wearing is not ordinary
My watches and my rings is not ordinary
Shawty what's the boo

[Pre Hook: Future (DJ Khaled)]
They tryna blackball me
(Fuckboys hate to see me winning)
They tryna blackball me
(Kept shit 100 from the beginning)
They tryna blackball me
(They wanna see me lose everything I got)
They tryna blackball me
(Y'all keep hating, I'm right here on top)

[Hook: Future]
They tryna blackball me, they say I get too much money
They want my name from me because they know what it do
They say I'm A-Rod, nigga, cause I got the juice
They tryna blackball me, went and bought a Ghost as a coupe
Soon as I ordered it, they put it right on the boat
These bitches hungry, they tryna take me to court
They tryna blackball me, I should of went to the pros
They tryna blackball me, I keep a gang of them hoes

[Verse 1: Plies]
I'm tryna fuck me thirty hoes by the end of this month
Ain't drive my Rolls Royce no more, I seen a fuck nigga in one
I heard some niggas downtown tried to jail me up
I heard they tell the Feds everyday to pick me up
But I'm like damn my nigga what I did to you?
And I'm like damn my nigga what you want me to do?
Want me to burn your pussy ass out and knock you off?
Want me to go by your baby momma house and kick in her door?
Guess what? Some 36 niggas, they’ll be here tomorrow
Don’t know what the fuck they goin' on, I’m gonna go buy some Lamar
My homie pulled me to the side and told me tell me the truth
She say she heard I’m fuckin' her sister I say she’ll fuck me and you

[Hook: Future]
They tryna blackball me, they say I get too much money
They want my name from me because they know what it do
They say I'm A-Rod, nigga, cause I got the juice
They tryna blackball me, went and bought a Ghost as a coupe
Soon as I ordered it, they put it right on the boat
These bitches hungry, they tryna take me to court
They tryna blackball me, I should of went to the pros
They tryna blackball me, I keep a gang of them hoes

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Say, when you getting money, that shit bring plenty haters
Just cop that Phantom coupe, I list a Grammy later
White crib a couple acres, she fin that good Jamaica
They tryin to count me out, but bitch I’m back like Schwarzenegger
They tryina blackball me, don’t wanna see me win
Hit after fuckin' hit, like there he go again
They say I’m underrated, I’m just misunderstood
They can’t compare to me, I wish, I wish you would
I’m screaming, "Fuck the world and everything in it"
My homie beat his case, cause they can’t find a witness
You wanna test my G, man fuck this industry
I strap C-4 to your mattress, for those who sleepin' on me

[Hook: Future]
They tryna blackball me, they say I get too much money
They want my name from me because they know what it do
They say I'm A-Rod, nigga, cause I got the juice
They tryna blackball me, went and bought a Ghost as a coupe
Soon as I ordered it, they put it right on the boat
These bitches hungry, they tryna take me to court
They tryna blackball me, I should of went to the pros
They tryna blackball me, I keep a gang of them hoes

[Bridge: Future]
