[Hook: Plies]
When I was broke wasn’t mad at nobody but myself
I showed you love find out you was pussy I’m mad at myself
Thought you was gon’ ride and you ain’t ride I’m mad at myself
I found out that you wasn’t shit I’m mad at myself
When I was broke wasn’t mad at nobody but myself
I showed you love find out you was pussy I’m mad at myself
Thought you was gon’ ride and you ain’t ride I’m mad at myself
I found out that you wasn’t shit I’m mad at myself

[Verse 1: Plies]
Thought you were my round
Thought you were my whoa
I thought if anybody was gonna ride it was gonna be you
Ain’t know you was coochie ain’t know you were plottin’
Ain’t know back then
But I do know now
Wished you would of stayed
Wished you was a G
Wished you would of stood up in the paint nigga just like me
But you didn’t so you didn’t
So it is what it is
Everybody ain’t me
Everybody ain’t real
Ain’t talked to you lately
What’s good wit ya ho
They switched out on me
But it’s all good though
Left a nigga for dead
Damn glad I could swim
When it’s being get dealt with
That’s when shit get real

[Hook: Plies]

[Verse 2: Plies]
I remember they told me real niggas they do real things
That’s all I do my nigga straight up I do real things
I don’t care ‘bout him
I don’t care ‘bout her
Ain’t nothin’ you can do
Just support me bruh
I’m real myself
Stay real my dawg
One thing don’t do
Do flaw with flaw
If a nigga gon’ ride he gon’ ride you ain’t gotta tell ‘em
Now if a ho gon’ ride she gon’ ride you ain’t gotta beg ‘er
One thing ‘bout a pussy ass nigga when he around me nigga I can smell ‘em
One thing ‘bout a snake when you cut that grass oh you gon’ see ‘em
So who really for me and who really ain’t don’t do make me nothin’
But it ain’t no fun when the rabbit got the gun
