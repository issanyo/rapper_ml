[Chorus]
Bag talk (bag talk, bag talk)
I ain’t seen a foreign that I like that I ain’t bought (ain’t bought)
Got the stick on deck don’t make me knock yo ass off
In the vert with the dick skin back that’s the top off (top off)
I ain’t goin’ back and forth with you niggas let the bag talk

[Verse 1]
With a bad bitch naked we on Star Island (Star Island)
I do not fuck with ‘cause you be dick ridin’ (dick ridin’)
I count money, stay in shape, I don’t do no exercisin’ (no exercising)
You wasn’t never in the streets so I don’t recognize it
She just sent a text and said she dickmatized (dickmatized)
I texted her back and told her from here on out the pussy mine (pussy mine)
Walkin’ through the mansion with my slippers on (slippers on)
I paid three m’s for this bitch and I ain't never home
I just ordered a filet, I told them butterfly it (butterfly it)
And I don’t fuck with you niggas playin’ both sides (both sides)
I know these people at the bank I know they sick of me (why)
Soon as they see me they grab the money machine

[Chorus]
Bag talk (bag talk, bag talk)
I ain’t seen a foreign that I like that I ain’t bought (ain’t bought)
Got the stick on deck don’t make me knock yo ass off
In the vert with the dick skin back that’s the top off (top off)
I ain’t goin’ back and forth with you niggas let the bag talk

[Verse 2]
When it come to this money I got a sweet tooth (sweet tooth)
All this ice on me, nigga, I need an igloo (bruuhh)
Got a bitch in the bed look like she from Beirut (woo)
She wanna taste so I gave her ass a facial (ehh)
My partner before he died tole me run it up (run it up)
My nigga called from prison we just chopped it up (chopped it up)
I just made movie, nigga, last night (last night)
Ran through a hundred bands nigga in one night (beep)
My brother called me laughing sayin’ that’s pocket change (pocket change)
We done put more than that on a nigga brain
I know these people think a nigga print money (print money) (why)
‘Cause every time they see me I’m spendin’ some

[Chorus]
Bag talk (bag talk, bag talk)
I ain’t seen a foreign that I like that I ain’t bought (ain’t bought)
Got the stick on deck don’t make me knock yo ass off
In the vert with the dick skin back that’s the top off (top off)
I ain’t goin’ back and forth with you niggas let the bag talk
