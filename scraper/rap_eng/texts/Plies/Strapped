[Intro]
Strapped, boy I’m strapped
Strapped, you know I keep it on me
Strapped, (always on me, believe that)
Oh I ain’t talking about my fire though
(I ain’t talking about no pistol)
I’m strapped every time you see me though
Strapped, let me tell you what I’m talkin bout
(Strapped 6x), when I say strapped

[Hook]
Lil’ nigga I’m strapped
And I ain’t talking no pistol, when I tell you I’m strapped
Lil’ nigga I’m strapped
What I’am talking about, all this money on me
Lil’ nigga I’m strapped
And every time I move, best believe there’ll be cash on deck
Lil’ nigga I’m strapped
And no it ain’t the liquor, it’s the money got me talkin like this
Lil’ nigga I’m strapped
Strapped, Strapped

[Verse 1]
I feel so mo’fuckin good, where the picture mane at
These hoes love a nigga like me, cuz I talk that shit
Car ride so good, feel like I’m floating on air
TV’s so big, got a nigga feeling just like I’m there
I’am not the nigga, you will ever see wearing some Giuseppe’s
But I’am the nigga, spend 300K on a necklace
Still breaking money down, put all in rubber bands
I still shoot dice on one knee, with my money in my hand
I stand on my mo’fuckin car, every time I get drunk
And walk on top of that bitch, nigga I don’t give a fuck
I spend it like water lil nigga, can’t take it to my grave
I fired my old bitch, got a new bitch nigga on the way

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Twelve months ago, a nigga like me was still in the kitchen
And ask a lil fuck fuck nigga, why he still all in my business
Blue chucks on nigga, gotta nigga looking like he crippin’
Paid 75 hundred for the cannon, nigga cracka got me gripping
Walked in the club, with a whole ounce stashed in my shoe
Ain’t got no mo’fuckin shooters, nigga I’m gonna shoot
Drive so slow, like I’m riding in the middle of a parade
All eyes on me nigga, like I’m standing on a stage
Before she get this dick, guess what then the bitch gonna bathe
Hair so low on the pussy, look like the pussy gotta fade
Cuban so big, hope my mo’fuckin neck don’t break
Vert hit so hard, make the whole fucking ground shake

[Hook]
