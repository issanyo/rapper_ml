[Chorus]
This is how I'm living, how I'm living
How I'm living, how I'm living
How I'm living, how I'm living
It ain't nothing like you've seen on BET
How I'm living
How I'm living, how I'm living
How I'm living, how I'm living
It ain't nothing like you've seen on BET

[Verse 1]
Where I'm from, it's a couple things that you won't see
You ain't gon' see no Maybachs or no Bentleys
And you ain't finna see no cribs worth a half a million
But there's a couple things, nigga, that you will see
Niggas riding around with choppers on the front seat
And niggas posted in the dope hole trying to eat
And the police riding back to back, six deep
'Cause what you see and what I see is two different things
I see niggas riding Chevys, a lot of cocaine
And where I'm from, niggas don't drink Cris, mane
Niggas drink yak, crackers drink champagne
And when you niggas get rich, it's funny how shit change
With that $200 for that Cris, I can get into the game
And cop me some of that hard or some of that white thing
If you've been in the hood, then how I'm living, why concern about you?
Now that you got a little money, nigga, you've been flipped this shit for crackers

[Chorus]
This is how I'm living, how I'm living
How I'm living, how I'm living
How I'm living, how I'm living
It ain't nothing like you've seen on BET
How I'm living
How I'm living, how I'm living
How I'm living, how I'm living
It ain't nothing like you've seen on BET

[Verse 2]
And in the hood, we want you impressed by 9:11
'Cause every day in the hood is fucking 9/11
When 9/11 happened, it was just a couple killers
You'd find more killers around this bitch sitting in trucks, nigga
These boys like Bin Laden, but behind tint, nigga
The only difference is Bin Laden just gon' send them
A true killer will get you himself, last I remember
A plane got to hit the World Trade a couple of more times
To catch up with all of these motherfuckers around here dying
And God, I want you to stop me if you think I'm lying
I bet there's 10,000 open cases right now
And y'all depicted a couple off a thousand cases
Me and your motherfucking family need to trade places
So you can look around the hood and see all the sad faces
As soon as a nigga get killed, you hollering "drug related"
I know you can hear it in my voice, you can tell I'm hot, too
I feel the same way you feel, cracker, fuck you
A lot of men died in two days, but it don't make the news
A little white girl come up missing, it's all over the news
And you would give a bitch a million for a couple crews
I bet you need my people, cracker, before we need you

[Chorus]
This is how I'm living, how I'm living
How I'm living, how I'm living
How I'm living, how I'm living
It ain't nothing like you've seen on BET
How I'm living
How I'm living, how I'm living
How I'm living, how I'm living
It ain't nothing like you've seen on BET

[Outro]
The same shit happening everywhere around the world, dog
Your motherfucking hood ain't no harder than mine
And my hood ain't no harder than yours
Fort Myers, dog, AKA Pakistan
You already know what we call it
Duval, Tallahassee, Gainesville, West Palm
Lauderdale, Dade County, Tampa, St. Pete
Clearwater, Orlando, Polk County, Mims, Titusville
And all surrounding areas in between, dog
This how we living in Florida, nigga
Please believe it, baby
Florida, I told you I got you, my nigga
And when them motherfuckers put me on how I'm living
I'll take you in my hood, nigga, 'cause that's how I'm living
