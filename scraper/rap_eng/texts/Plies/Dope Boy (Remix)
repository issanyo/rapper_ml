[Intro]
Ay, I think I might get indicted off this one, nigga
This for my motherfucking dope boys, nigga

[Chorus]
Who put the Chevys in the game, nigga? (A dope boy)
The first nigga on 26's (was a dope boy)
I bet the nigga you fucking right now (a dope boy)
And this the year of the motherfucking dope boys
Who put the Chevys in the game, nigga? (A dope boy)
The first nigga on 26's (was a dope boy)
I bet the nigga you fucking right now (a dope boy)
And this the year of the motherfucking dope boys

[Verse 1]
A dope boy is who these rap niggas wanna be
This shit real out here, this ain't TV
A nigga knock your ass off, nigga about a G
Can make a quarter bird look like a whole key
In the hood, a dope boy symbolize success
Can lock us up, but you can't take us out the projects
My momma told me to sit down 'cause she can't rest
I told her thank the streets for the diamonds on her neck
You can't fault her, I'm fucked up, she did her best
Without the dope game, nigga, I'll be hopeless
The only thing that motivated me, nothing else
It's God, then a dope boy, that's how I felt

[Chorus]
Who put the Chevys in the game, nigga? (A dope boy)
The first nigga on 26's (was a dope boy)
I bet the nigga you fucking right now (a dope boy)
And this the year of the motherfucking dope boys
Who put the Chevys in the game, nigga? (A dope boy)
The first nigga on 26's (was a dope boy)
I bet the nigga you fucking right now (a dope boy)
And this the year of the motherfucking dope boys

[Verse 2:]
I don't know if the dope game worth going Fed
But I know one motherfucking thing: it's where the money at
Ain't stunting these crackers, nigga, y'all worry about that
I feel like I could do mine if it came to that
I bet these little jits couldn't tell you who the mayor is
But they could tell you niggas on them 26's is
Dope boy the biggest thing to ever hit the crib
Anybody who somebody, a dope boy their career
In the hood, nigga, who everybody talking 'bout?
And who these silly ass hoes around here fighting 'bout?
A dope boy the biggest thing that ever came out
You better put something aside, nigga, before the drought

[Chorus]
Who put the Chevys in the game, nigga? (A dope boy)
The first nigga on 26's (was a dope boy)
I bet the nigga you fucking right now (a dope boy)
And this the year of the motherfucking dope boys
Who put the Chevys in the game, nigga? (A dope boy)
The first nigga on 26's (was a dope boy)
I bet the nigga you fucking right now (a dope boy)
And this the year of the motherfucking dope boys

[Outro]
Ay, dog
I want y'all niggas to know something, man
Without information
These pussy ass crackers ain't got nothing, dog
If you keep it G with the niggas you're running with, homie
You can stay out here a long time, boy
If you don't get caught with it on you
All that shit a bitch downtown talking 'bout don't mean nothing, nigga
