[Intro: Plies & Ella Mai]
Plies edition
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Ella Mai]
Feelings, so deep in my feelings
No, this ain't really like me
Can't control my anxiety
Feeling, like I'm touching the ceiling
When I'm with you I can't breathe
Boy you do something to me

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai]
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do, yeah yeah
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do

[Chorus: Ella Mai]
Listen to my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum it just won't stop, it go
Ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, it just won't stop, it go

[Verse 2: Plies]
Keep your panties on, I don't wanna hit, I feel like massagin' you
Blow in your ear and pull your ponytail, I like arousing you
Pull up on your mama and give her a bag just for having you
Credit good and pussy fire, how can I stay mad at you?
Buy you cars and ship them to you just to show my gratitude
Tell your kids they don't need for nothin', I'm puttin' 'em all in private school
You got no kids, I can give you some, that's just an excuse to be raw in you
Cut my phone off when I'm 'round you, that's how much I'm enjoying you
Side chicks can't penetrate me, been off that since Bust It baby
Showing myself that I can settle down, that's what motivate me
She and I had to answer that with women that wasn't even worth the shit
Now that I can look back at it, half it wasn't even worth the dick
Nine out of ten, if she a queen, she a sweetheart
Stop putting these hoes before these real women, yeah that part
Find a woman that loves you for you, don't let her get away
You better get boo'd up and go'n cuff, yeah the rock way

[Verse 3: Ella Mai]
How, how many ways can I say that I need you, baby, it's true
I think I might die without you
Feeling all over my body
You know how I like it
Ain't gotta tell you what to do, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai]
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do, yeah yeah
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do

[Chorus: Ella Mai]
Listen to my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum it just won't stop, it go
Ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, it just won't stop, it go

[Verse 4: Ella Mai]
Head over heels in love
Right in front of you, ain't gotta look no more baby (hah)
I wanna build this love
And everything you want, you ain't gotta ask for
You got me boo'd up, boo'd up
Boo'd up, boo'd up
Told you from the jump I'm the one to choose
Ya got me boo'd up, boo'd up
Boo'd up, boo'd up
Grab me by the waist baby, pull me closer

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai]
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do, yeah yeah
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do

[Chorus: Ella Mai]
Listen to my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum it just won't stop, it go
Ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, it just won't stop, it go
