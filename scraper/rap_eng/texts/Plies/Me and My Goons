[Intro]
I keep a couple killas round me when I move (Keep a couple killas)
'Cause I don't really fuck with a lot of these dudes (I don't really fuck with)
You won't rob me, but I might rob you (Might rob you)
So when you see me, you gon' see my goons (When you see me)
I keep a couple killas round me when I move (Keep a couple killas)
'Cause I don't really fuck with a lot of these dudes (I don't really fuck with)
You won't rob me, but I might rob you (Might rob you)
So when you see me, you gon' see my goons (When you see me)

[Verse 1]
Couple killers on my right, couple killers on my left
But I am a muthafuckin' killer myself
Got my Glock 40 right up under my belt
Hit you wit this burner and you will melt
I only hang with my goons and nobody else
So you better keep your hands to yourself
When I say I'm ready, then they go to step
You ain't got enough guns, you gon need some help
Make sure it's what you want, 'cause we'll shoot you to death
'Cause we a lil' silly, we is bad for your health
All of us stay with it, all of us stay strapped
That's why I keep all my goons on deck

[Hook]
I keep a couple killas round me when I move (Keep a couple killas)

[Verse 2]
Smell the liquor on my breath, smell the dro on my skin
Look, they throwin' big faces in the wind
I'm not friendly, I am not your friend
Gave the bouncer 200, he slipped my fire in
Whenever yall ready, let the shootin' games begin
I'm walking kind of slow 'cause my fire big
Either yall better chill or we gon mess up yall gig
We all lookin' crazy 'cause all us bent
My goons paranoid, so please don't flinch
Because all my goons ain't got good sense
We all dead drunk, and all us lit
But I love my goons 'cause they tote they shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't come solo tonight, I'm with my clique
I haven't seen her since I fucked that bitch
And I haven't called her so I know she sick
Pushed her off on the goons let one of them hit
But I gotta stay focused 'cause these niggas real slick
You will not rob me, turn around and sell my shit
Keep my eyes open 'cause it happen' real quick
How many of us with fire, mmm, 'bout 6
