[Intro]
Know it’s so crazy to me
That when you die, that’s when they show you the most love
They cry for you, get you flowers
Talk good about you
Man, don’t do that shit when I die, nigga

[Chorus]
They show you love when you die
Get you flowers when you die
Talk good when you die
They cry for you when you die
Don’t do that shit when I die
Do it for me right now
Don’t do that shit when I die
Do it for me right now, nigga

[Verse 1]
Niggas hate you when you living, niggas cry when you die
Niggas laughing, niggas hugging, but they hate you inside
Niggas showing fake love, niggas shooting you lies
The world wanna see you go, they don’t want you to shine
Never sleep on a nigga, so don’t close my eyes
See the slime getting slimed, I ain’t never surprised
When you die, trust they come with all the different shit
All the calls, all the crying, all emotional shit
Niggers always told me it was a cold cold world
99 point 9 percent this world ain't thorough
Before they help your ass swim they drown you, fool
Fore, a nigga show you love, he will lie on you, fool
Don't wait to throw a block party when they put me in the ground
Want to throw a black party, nigga, throw it for me now!
Don't wait for me just to die before your N.T
Show that same love now if you really for me!

[Chorus]
They show you love when you die
Get you flowers when you die
Talk good when you die
They cry for you when you die
Don’t do that shit when I die
Do it for me right now
Don’t do that shit when I die
Do it for me right now, nigga

[Verse 2]
The day I sit and write your mamma, have a proud day
When you was living they wouldn't need try to go by their way
All of a sudden, got nobody got nothing bad to say
Left the fellas when you was living, you and him were straight
But niggers come with all the love when they put you away
When they drop you in that whole, niggers scared to hate
But when you was living ain't nobody wanna tell you you great
Niggers rather talk down, then throw dirt in your face
When you die, niggers know that you're gone for ever
Out of sight, out of mind is when the day is they miss you
All the deals, all the mornings, all the flowers come
Niggers feel you ain't a threat 'cause you dead and you done
Got flowers for me, motherfucker? Give 'em to me now
You gn'cry when I die? Nigga, cry for me now!
If you got love for me nigga, I need to feel it right now
No way to show me that you love me, motherfucker, when I die

[Chorus]
They show you love when you die
Get you flowers when you die
Talk good when you die
They cry for you when you die
Don’t do that shit when I die
Do it for me right now
Don’t do that shit when I die
Do it for me right now, nigga
