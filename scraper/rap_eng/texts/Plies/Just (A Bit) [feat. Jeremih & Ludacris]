[Jeremih:]
Girl I don't mean to be managed (mannish)
But something's on my mind
And I've decided
That you should just have it
Promise that it ain't too much no
I hope that you can understand this
Feeling that's inside
Put your fears aside
And we can just manage
Promise that it ain't too much
But just enough
Just a (the) tip
Just a (the) tip
Just a (the) tip
I promise that it ain't too much
But just enough
[Plies:]
We ain't gotta do nothing
Just Let me put the head in
Ain't gon' move or nothing though
I'm dead serious
How 'bout 2 or 3 pumps 3 that's it
If I don't make you feel good at first then I quit
Why you tripping move your hand out the way real quick
Why you always laughing ke ke'in and bullshittin
If you love me you'll let me do it I'm just saying
Take them off and pull them to the side stop playing
Tell the truth I make you feel good errytime
It ain't my fault girl you just be so damn fine
Let me put it in though for the hundredth time
Ain't gon' keep on begging ask you for the last time
You don't even got to do nothing you can just lay there
You ain't gotta throw it back or nuthin, I dont even care
I dont even do you like that, You dont play fair
Hmm I know you gon' let me in there

[Ludacris:]
Luda! I just wanna put the tip in
Just enough of your water to skinny dip in
A little motion in your ocean
Hit the spot and concoct your love potion
Shut off (up) that commotion and listen here
I wanna get to biting like Tyson, nibbling on your ear
Whispering sweet nothings
I can hear your heart beat pumping sending chills down your body
It's probably cause you're my main squeeze
And my ice cream cone gives you a brain freeze
Yeah I be causing an avalanche
You might be calling an ambulance
Now I got you whipped get a grip
Cause the tip of my dick'll send you (your body) into convulsions
You've been working it all night girl
I think you deserve a promotion
