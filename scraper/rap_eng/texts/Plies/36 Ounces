[Intro]
Uh oh, uh oh
Ay, I don't know the niggas who invented the dope game
But from me to you, Plies wanna tell you thank you for the dope game
Y'all gave street niggas a way of hope
36 ounces of yola, nigga
That's a whole brick
And 'fore you lose that whole ounce, nigga, splash some cold water in that motherfucker

[Chorus]
Nigga, I'm out here, I'm trying to get these 36's
'Cause I can ball how I want to and I get them 36's
And y'all niggas don't wanna see me with them 36's
But y'all niggas gon' know that I get them 36's
That 36 ounces, nigga, that's a whole brick
And I'm one flip away from getting a 36
And I'ma either go Fed or I'm gon' be rich
A motherfucker better not me get them 36's

[Verse 1]
Ain't graduate from college, that's the White American dream
But for a nigga in the hood, it's 36 of them things
And in the hood, hitting the lottery would make your life change
But a key of cocaine the next best thing
Nigga, I'm trying to get rich and stay out of these crackers' face
And in the process, keep you fuck niggas out my face
Thought when my money wasn't right, nigga, I stayed in my place
And I do need the same pussy niggas to stay out my face
Up in the hood with 20 G's, you a motherfucker
I ain't got to be getting ten birds to be a motherfucker
If I'm with 20 G's, you would never know, motherfucker
I know a quarter birds [?]
But with a key, I can live off the cheddar
I know you pussy niggas don't wanna see me get money
When I get them 36's, I'ma show you some real stunting
And I'ma show you pussies what to do with this dope money

[Chorus]
Nigga, I'm out here, I'm trying to get these 36's
'Cause I can ball how I want to and I get them 36's
And y'all niggas don't wanna see me with them 36's
But y'all niggas gon' know that I get them 36's
That 36 ounces, nigga, that's a whole brick
And I'm one flip away from getting a 36
And I'ma either go Fed or I'm gon' be rich
A motherfucker better not me get them 36's

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to stack mine 'cause stunting get the Feds' attention
And I ain't gotta go to prison first before I start listening
I got in the game for the money, y'all can have the bitches
'Cause a bitch ain't gon' send me nothing when I start [?]
I understand there's a lot of bullshit that money bring
And motherfuckers quick to tell you money ain't everything
Them be the main motherfuckers who ain't got a thing
'Cause money ain't everything, nigga, it's the only thing
But I've done been broke before and that's a fucked up feeling
And I refuse to go broke again long as I'm living
So if that means I'm throwing rocks at the penitentiary
If I'ma be out here broke, I'd rather be in the penitentiary

[Chorus]
Nigga, I'm out here, I'm trying to get these 36's
'Cause I can ball how I want to and I get them 36's
And y'all niggas don't wanna see me with them 36's
But y'all niggas gon' know that I get them 36's
That 36 ounces, nigga, that's a whole brick
And I'm one flip away from getting a 36
And I'ma either go Fed or I'm gon' be rich
A motherfucker better not me get them 36's

[Verse 3]
Religion and dope the only hope the hood got
And the Bible is something that I don't really know about
So I'ma speak through what I know and that's grinding it out
And long as reefer and [?]
And I ain't got too many options, so I'ma just stick to hustling
This shit crazy right now, I can't afford a loss
And everybody around here jacking up the cost
Only thing that I'm finna do is [?]
But somebody else got to get it 'cause I can't eat the loss
I'm online right now, I can't get shut off
I got to have mine, young nigga, at all costs
And I got to have mine, young nigga, at all costs

[Chorus]
Nigga, I'm out here, I'm trying to get these 36's
'Cause I can ball how I want to and I get them 36's
And y'all niggas don't wanna see me with them 36's
But y'all niggas gon' know that I get them 36's
That 36 ounces, nigga, that's a whole brick
And I'm one flip away from getting a 36
And I'ma either go Fed or I'm gon' be rich
A motherfucker better not me get them 36's

[Outro]
Ay, all them niggas out there getting money, man
Can y'all do me a favor and watch it out there, man?
Ay, if you got a spot, my nigga
If them niggas ain't got no twerk, cuz
Don't have them niggas around your spot, dog
Only thing dog done doing is getting your spot hotter, man
You ain't got no twerk, dog
Stay off the block, you feel me?
36 ounces, nigga
36, 36, 36, 36
