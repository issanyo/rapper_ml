[Chorus]
Better ride with your fire, stay your ass home (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone
And any faggot nigga live, then cut them choppers on (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone
It's where the jack boys hang and where the goons roam (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone
Keep one in the chamber 'cause cocking it take too long (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone

[Verse 1]
The crackers got a law called 10-20-life
The streets got a law called ride with your fire
A street nigga, so the street law I live by
In these streets, nigga, only the smart survive
'Cause where the weak and the pussy niggas get tried
Thug niggas don't respect money, they respect fire
So if got to, you better stay strapped or die
Better walk light and keep your head on the swivel
Make sure you stay at arms reach on your pistol
Don't let him fool you, keep your eye on the young nigga
Keep thinking he sweet and he gon' be the bitch to kill you
And if you pull it, you better use it, that's all I gotta tell you

[Chorus]
Better ride with your fire, stay your ass home (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone
And any faggot nigga live, then cut them choppers on (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone
It's where the jack boys hang and where the goons roam (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone
Keep one in the chamber 'cause cocking it take too long (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone

[Verse 2]
If you ain't from around here, you better keep your doors locked
And your windows wound up with your shit cocked
'Cause them crackers gon' have you on the news at six o'clock
Slumped over in your shit with a head shot
'Cause if it look sweet, niggas trying it off top
The last four days around here, a bitch done got shot
And all you see is yellow tape and white chalk
That's where the doors get kicked, heads get bussed
And run your dick sucker liable to get you clapped up
'Cause them hot slugs will fill your little ass up
So if you think it look fishy, you better buss
'Cause you in a chopper zone and choppers is a must

[Chorus]
Better ride with your fire, stay your ass home (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone
And any faggot nigga live, then cut them choppers on (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone
It's where the jack boys hang and where the goons roam (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone
Keep one in the chamber 'cause cocking it take too long (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone

[Verse 3]
The funeral home down here, nigga, it's big business
I ain't seen a fight in five years, boy, niggas spitting
When niggas shoot choppers, it's hard to do too much missing
Niggas getting up on your ass now, ain't no long distance
You see a nigga bend that corner, you better start shipping
'Cause it's too late to move when that thing start ripping
Don't take nothing but one of them hot ones to leave your ass finished
And that little mouth you got on you gon' leave your ass dripping

[Chorus]
Better ride with your fire, stay your ass home (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone
And any faggot nigga live, then cut them choppers on (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone
It's where the jack boys hang and where the goons roam (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone
Keep one in the chamber 'cause cocking it take too long (why?)
'Cause you in a motherfucking chopper zone
