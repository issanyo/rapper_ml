Already told ya dawg, I'm a button ya ass
Nigga sizing me dawg, something I will not have
Swear to god on a stack of bibles, I'm off ya ass
Fuck around with me, you gone get that shit bag

[Verse 1:]
Woke up this morning hired me a lawyer
Told him be ready to bail me out, when I call ya
Next bitch that play with me, I'mma off em
When I pull my fire, you can gone chalk em
Nigga do somethin to me, you crazy as fuck
Ain't no faking over here, I'm shootin yo ass up
Playin them gangsta games will get your ass bust
Go and tell yo momma, Go and pick the church

Next time you see me in these streets, I'm on high alert
So go and come with that bullshit and leave bust
Betta make sure your ready before you pull a stunt

[Hook]2x

[Verse 2:]
Try me I bet I leave yo ass in a pamper
First bitch get outta line I'm making an example
Thinking about tryin me, you better go and cancel
Kill one of you bitch niggas, that's my final answer
Have you pissing and shitting in the same bag nigga
Set yo ass on fire with this 4 nigga
Spec the room where I'mma leave yo ass stank nigga
And ain't leavin that house if I ain't got my pistol
Keep playin you gonna get yo muthafuckin issue
Fuckin with the wrong nigga get yo ass crippled
Come from under my shirt shoot straight missles
Make you a part of that shit bag family nigga

[Hook]2x

[Verse 3:]

You niggas playing like you is, this ain't what you bout
Being pussy I never have and never will

Been bout that life, nigga I been trill

You niggas talkin that shit, better know yo choppa skills
Cause yo muthafuckin brains will get spilled
Fucking round with me will get yo cap peeled
Better play with somebody else if you wanna live
