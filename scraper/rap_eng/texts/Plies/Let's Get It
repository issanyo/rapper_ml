Whatever you bout I'm bout
Whatever you with I'm with
Whenever you ready all you gotta do is say let's get it
All you gotta say let's get it
All you gotta say let's get it
All you gotta say let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it

[Verse 1]
Ok mother fucker let me tell you something
I'm in it with my squad and all us out here bucking
We know how to set it off but we don't know how to dougie
One wrong move homie we go have you ducking
And 200 for these damn Jordan's so ain't went to stomping
Pay 50 bucks for this throwaway so I am with the upping
One thang I can promise you boy we ain't with them bluffing
Got me a small clique and my homeboys and the rest of 'em my cousins
That's my homeboy and he fucked up but ain't nobody here go touch him
He came with me and he go leave with me and that's the end of discussion
Let's get it let's get it
All you gotta say let's get it
Everybody in my circle want it
You bet believe that I love 'em let's get it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Told you you know I'm bout it boy

[Verse 3]
Hustle for the frankalin
Messing with the Benjamin
Everyday I'm out here trying to come up with a master plan
I'm just trying to hustle man
I keep thinking bout robing man
Only thing I need right now is run it cross bout six and sayings
Ain't nobody go give me nothing so I might as well gone take the chance
You ain't got mo money dawg and you go be a lonely man
I gotta make some sake

My dawg just called my phone and this is all he yelling on the other end is let's get it let's get it
All he keep on yelling is let's get items get it
All he keep yelling is let's get it let's get it
All he keep yelling is let's get it let's get it
Fuck it dawg don't whisper let's get it
