Bend it, bend it, bend it over

Go and bust it open
Bend it, bend it, bend it over
Let me see what you working with
Bend it, bend it, bend it over
I wanna see you twerk something
Bend it, bend it, bend it over
Go and let me bless you dear
Bend it, bend it, bend it over

[Chorus]

Go and bust it open
Bend it, bend it, bend it over
Let me see what you working with
Bend it, bend it, bend it over
I wanna see you twerk something
Bend it, bend it, bend it over
Go and let me bless you dear
Bend it, bend it, bend it over

We’re going, baby,…
I’m tryna see that pink pit, make me feel like it’s Easter
I wanna see you bust that
I’mma show love
I ain’t looking for nothing free, you know I got my cheese up

I've been tryna get a sneak peek
I'm on good dope, need no sleep
I've been tryna get a one on one
Me and you and you and me
I've been running my checks up
I'm good, baby, don't need no receipt
I need you to bend it over
And make that thang go right at me
Can you make them muscles move?
Make it breathe for me!
Can you make them cheeks jump?
Make them bounce from me!
Can you make that ass clap?
Make it clap for me!
And if you do that one more time
Tell you now, I'mma paint somethin

[Chorus]

[Xtra]
Talkin bout red bitch
Red pill, red cup, red J
Purple weed, purple drink
I can stare at your ass for days
Black bitch, pink pussy
Little bit of hair on it
Short bitch, fat ass
Watch this stack stand upon it
Whole gang's suped up
Watch her do that crazy shit
She don't want that nigga so she
Pretend she ain't got the pain and shit
Here with all my niggas
And everybody got a different business
Shake what your mamma gave
Matter of fact, that who I'm trying to hit
I can't even move, I snuck before all of this biz
That pussy sitting all right
I'm trying to go off in that business
All the money you made tonight
Is time you throw it all in that business
Pop that pussy for the realist motherfucker off in this bitch

[Chorus]

Pussy popping, everything look good
Good pussy alert
I just wanna see if she can take it
Big dick alert
All I got is wads in my pocket
Ain't no wallets, nigga
All I got is sliders in my gear
Ridin solid, nigga
Dranking on shit that people say
Fuck your liver up
Smokin on shit that people say
Cost too fuckin much
Ride around in somethin that cost money
Ain't no Lambo
Told me she don't really like to suck it
I be damned, hoe!
I'mma fall back and play my part
Let you twerk it for me
I'mma grab your hand and put it on it
Lets just stroke it for me
Hands on your knees, face up
Go on, bend it over!
I'mma get behind you
Beat it good, come here
Let me show you!

[Chorus]
