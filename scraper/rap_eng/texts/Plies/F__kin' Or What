What we doing? (what we doing?)
What we doing? (what we doing?)
What we doing? (what we doing?)
I'mma ask you straight up!

[Verse 1]
Like I ain't really like tryna like be funny
But i'll send you on your way and give you gas money
Cause I ain't pressed on this end about no pussy honey
Cause I don't really like need like shit from you
Told me come scoop you up and I did that
I told you "I ain't with the games" and I meant that
And after certain type of hours I don't chit-chat
But when the sun goes down that's when the shit happens

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Hope you ain't got me on a humbug
Cause if you do you can pack up
I ain't tryna waste you time baby

Oh you tired? Oh you sleepy?
Tryna show me you ain't easy?
You can do it like easy
Just lock the door when your leaving

Get ya butt booky naked baby take off (take off)

If you is then lets make it happen
