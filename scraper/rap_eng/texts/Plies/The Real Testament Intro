[Intro]
I like to welcome all you motherfuckers to the Real Testament
This where the truth get told and bullshit ain’t tolerated

[Verse]
Before I sell my soul, I’ll lose everything
You can lock me up cracker
I’ma get out and do the same thing
You take this rap shit from me I’ll find another game
Don’t get this shit confused nigga this was never my dream
I only speak on what I been through nigga what I done seen
I rather kill myself before I live a lie
Before I ever turn informant nigga I rather fry
My momma lost me to the streets, I told her don’t cry
I told her if she understand real, she should understand why
The wrong slip in these streets and crackers hand you life
I done had plenty money nigga but never paid tithes
Nigga was caught up in this thugging, I apologize
You call the nigga your dawg but will he really ride?
The nigga know how to get money but will he testify?
Give a fuck why you told, snitching something I can’t buy
Rather I sell a hundred thousand or I sell a mill
The fact remains the same nigga I’m still real
Broke my heart they gave my lil homie 15 years
I put a cast on my heart in the place of the tears
He told me, “Plies I’m living through you while I’m in here”
The realest shit I ever heard that shit gave me chills
And I’ma get that time off him if it’s God’s will
And I don’t know when God coming that’s my only fear
Been drinking since I was 16 help me think clear
Don’t come to my funeral if I ain’t fuck with you while I was here
Some fuck niggas in the county now who trying to get me there
But niggas in hell want ice water so I don’t care
The opposite of you fuck niggas cause you a square
I know it’s some fuck niggas that hate me that I ain’t never met
Never talked to me never even seen me yet
Only thang they know is I’m where they trying to get
Respect it or check it nigga cause I don’t owe you shit
I been dealing with envy nigga ever since I was a jit
Hated by many, loved by the same so I’m even bitch
I put my hand on the bible and swear to tell the truth
You like to hear lies? ..this the wrong cd to listen to nigga!
