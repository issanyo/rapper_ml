[Intro]
Becky Becky Becky Becky
Becky Becky Becky Becky
Becky Becky Becky Becky
Becky Becky Becky Becky

[Chorus]
Becky, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you all
Becky, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you all

[Verse 1]
I could pipe you up, I could put you on a world stage
You can be my lil cigarette, treat you like a ashtray
DG on my shirt, what that mean? That that Dolce
Foreign cars I have a ticket
Woo, that's the boss way
She just out here fucking for the freak, that's the laws way
"I ain't never did this before" that's what they all say
How they like to beat it from the back, that's the dog way
Marble on the floor, dog you call her hallway
I been counting faces, got me feeling nauseous
All these hunnits on me got me feeling real cocky
Big rocks on me, got me feeling real rocky
She design a check say she feel like talking

[Chorus]
Becky, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you all
Becky, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you all

[Segue: City Girls, Drake & Magnolia Shorty]
Two bad bitches and we kissin' in the Wraith
Kissin'-kissin' in the Wraith, kiss-kissin' in the Wraith
I need that black card and the code to the safe
Code to the safe, code-code to the safe-safe
I show him how that neck work
Fuck that Netflix and chill—what's your net-net-net worth?
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
Yea, yea, yea, yea he bad
And I'm down for you always
Yea, yea, yea, guess who's back
And I'm down for you always
D-down for you al–
Black biggy biggy black biggy black blake
D-d-down for you always
I got a new boy, and that nigga trade!

[Chorus]
Becky, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you all
Becky, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you all
