[Hook 2x]
What's in my pocket, dawg, big face hundreds
Just left the mall, bought everything that I wanted
I kinda mad wit' you haters, I'm real disappointed
'Cause what you didn't tell the people, that I got plenty money
(Okay) I got plenty money, I got plenty money
(Okay) I got plenty money, I got plenty money
(Okay) I got plenty money, I got plenty money
(Okay) I got plenty money, I got plenty money
(Okay)

[Verse 1]
I like my bitches hood, but all my whips foreign
Just bought another house, the last one was boring
Ten-thousand square-feet, it feel like you tourin'
These niggas dissin' me, it really ain't important
Take off yo shirt, nigga, I bet yo ribs showin'
You nigga starvin', my money over-flowin'
Jewelry game sick, got all these hoes adorin'
Catch me in the club wit' all the 'gnac pourin'
If I ever go to prison, I'ma have plenty stories
Sleep real good, 'cause I ain't got no worries
Stay fresh everyday, jewelry stay glowin'
I got plenty money and all you niggas knowin'

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2]
Next month, guess what, I'm buyin' rappers
'Cause I'm startin' to feel sorry for you lil' bastards
I'm pretty hot, yo career a disaster
I control you niggas, somethin' like yo master
Sixty-five grand, that's 'round ??
Stay from 'round me if you don't like to smell cheddar
I ain't fuckin' wit that ho 'cause she a dick hacker
Wanna know who I'm fuckin', my money, I just married her
She been good to me, I might 5-karat her
Ran me out the store, I bought too many plasmas
Count so much money, breathe like I got asthma
The old sayin' is, "The more money, the marrier"

[Verse 3]
Ion't know why I bought the Bentley when I had the Mazerati
And what I paid for the "Goon" chain, one-fourty
Scared to keep money on me 'cause I will blow it
My strip club name is "Mr. Will-Throw-It"
Keep fire on deck and I will show it
Fuck wit' me and get wacked and all you niggas know it
Scared to dance in the club 'cause my fire loaded
If you won't use it, guess what, then don't tote it
Mo' money, to most niggas, mean mo' hoes
Mo' money, to me, it mean keep goin'
Haters gettin' tired, my money still growin'
Ball all night, catch a flight in the mornin'
