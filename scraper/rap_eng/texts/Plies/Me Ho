I’m on this bottle bitch thinkin' 'bout a lot of shit
I’m thinking Keri right now fuck a model bitch
I’m with my squad hold dese niggas like the rope bitch
They like a peel in dey drink or in they nose bitch
I’m in the corner with my shooters on some low shit
We sittin' there talking 'bout money and some mo shit
When you on dat ho shit, we own that dough shit
Don't ask us 'bout it nigga cause we don't know shit
If you ain’t broke bread then don’t you pow shit
And don’t you grab on me got on my new shit
And since I feel good, I brought the shooters out
And since the haters out I brought the goons out

I’ve been balling in dis bitch since I hit the door ho
I’m the shit ho, I'm tellin' you what I know ho
And ain’t none of these pussy ass niggas me ho!

I’m getting loose now, but ain’t slipping bruh
Dem hoes bounced on him, cause he ain’t tipping, bruh
I got the dang on me walking like I’m limpin' bro
I’m powin straight gas, but ain’t sipping, bro
Bitch I'm in grind mode gotta get dis cash bro
You better fly straight, or you gonna be missing, bro
It be packed that, the whole club swole… …
Gotta get my shine on, before this bitch closes
You got a man, ho, but he ain’t me, ho

He ain’t like me, I know you wanna be, ho
He all off brand nigga, I’m a G, ho

Chorus:

All street niggas look like we’re in the league hhun

I’m talkin’ slow ho, cause I’m drunk ho
I’ve been balling in dis bitch since I hit the door ho
I’m the shit ho, I'm tellin' you what I know ho
And ain’t none of these pussy ass niggas me ho!
