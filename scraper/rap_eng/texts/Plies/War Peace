[Verse 1: Plies]
Niggas start shit then abort the drama
Niggas at ya head now that nigga ya potna
Nigga that ain’t no boss shit
Bosses don’t waive no flag bitch
Sosa nigga killed Tony
But y’all niggas flex for the attention homie
Real niggas be have your issue homie
Don’t say that shit if you ain’t with it homie
Y’all niggas like to talk that shit
Y’all lil niggas ain’t ‘bout that shit
Rob they ass that Duval shit
Slide on yo ass that ‘fo my shit
Y’all lil niggas better snap up out it
If y’all lil niggas ain’t really ‘bout it
Cuz y’all lil niggas wanna rap about it
Then when shit get serious y’all wanna squash it

[Hook 2x: Plies]

[Verse 2: Plies]
Y’all niggas fuck with everybody for protection
Y’all niggas can’t stand up by yourself ya hear me
Y’all faking that shit that false perception
You can’t be a killa you too apologetic
Know 2500 niggas just like you
Talk a lot of shit won’t fight won’t shoot
When it time to go to war fuck nigga you spook
But you talk a good game that’s about all you do
You don’t wanna get up in these trenches for real
With them niggas running around with them cannons for real
And a nigga trying to find where yo momma and them live
And niggas jumping out getting off for real
Ya beta sit yo lil ass down lil boy
Cuz swimming with these sharks will get ya drowned lil boy
Cuz you don’t know who lurking in the dark lil boy
Cuz doing that shit take heart lil boy
Better do what a fuck nigga supposed to do
Shut up before a real nigga notice you
And y’all lil pussy ass rap niggas
I’m talking about you fuck niggas too
And I ain’t getting on the phone with none of y’all
Fuck y’all niggas I’ll murder y’all
And I talking about no rapping dawg
But I’m damn sure ‘bout that action dawg

[Hook 2x: Plies]
