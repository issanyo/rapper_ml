[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G. (Sampled)]
I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just...

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. (Sampled)]
I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I-I-I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just want the paper, I'm out like The Vapors
I-I-I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just want the paper, I'm out like The Vapors
I-I-I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just-I just-I just-I just-I just-I just-I just-I just

[Verse 1: Plies]
I'm on some other shit, nigga, I don't want no rap friends
'Cause you fuck niggas pocket watchers and I ain't with the plan
That's why I keep you niggas out my face much as I can
'Cause I'll be done killed one of you pussy niggas in the end
I'd like to thank all you fuck niggas who done went commercial
'Cause y'all made my job easier and that's for certain
Don't try to come back to these streets when you start hurting
Put your ears to the street, Plies done closed the curtain
I got the real niggas on lock, I done served my purpose
Write anther diss record 'cause the last one ain't working
You fuck niggas keep snitching, goons keep murking
And you can't find a lot of fuck niggas nann one of my verses

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. (Sampled)]
I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I-I-I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just want the paper, I'm out like The Vapors
I-I-I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just want the paper, I'm out like The Vapors
I-I-I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just-I just-I just-I just-I just-I just-I just-I just

[Verse 2: Plies]
I got niggas that's locked up that need lawyers
If I can't make that happen for them, then I ain't really balling
Gon' run you 50 stacks or better fucking with murder charges
And the lawyer want half of that 'fore he even get started
And if that break me, then fuck it, I keep it real, shawty
And I'ma keep grinding so my niggas can keep calling
And you little fuck niggas around here hating, want y'all to keep talking
Need y'all to speak up a little bit 'cause I'm way up here, shawty
Just dropped two birds in the Chevy, I need that back
And to do it the right way, it's gon' run you about 40 stacks
Inside the Hummer on 6's, nigga, on top of that
Think I got time to argue with you little fuck niggas on wax?
But we can shoot it out in the streets, I'll make time for that
And while your mind on me, I'm out here getting checks
And still thugging and keeping it real in the process
I'ma be the firstnigga to get a mill and keep his hood's respect

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. (Sampled)]
I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I-I-I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just want the paper, I'm out like The Vapors
I-I-I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just want the paper, I'm out like The Vapors
I-I-I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just-I just-I just-I just-I just-I just-I just-I just

[Verse 3: Plies]
More money, more problems, nigga, more guns
The more money I get, the more I'm buying drugs
And watch the news, more dead bodies still to come
The more niggas that hate me, the happier I become
The motherfuckers that hate, the ones with nothing going
And you little fuck niggas trying to win, I already done won
And let me tell you little rap ass niggas something
Show me a rap nigga who done did what I done done
You got a hot song, I got 30 to choose from
You doing shows for peanuts, I'm  12 5 to 1
You know how it feel to have a hundred thousand dollars a month?
You fuck niggas still got neezys, I got ones

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. (Sampled)]
I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I-I-I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just want the paper, I'm out like The Vapors
I-I-I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just want the paper, I'm out like The Vapors
I-I-I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just-I just-I just-I just-I just-I just-I just-I just
I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I-I-I just want the paper, I just-I just want the paper
I just-I just-I just-I just-I just-I just-I just-I just
