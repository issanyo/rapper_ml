[Hook: Jeremih]
Girl I don't mean to be mannish
But something's on my mind
And I've decided that you should just have it
I promise that it ain't too much, nooo
I hope that you can understand this
The feeling that's inside
Put your fears aside and we can just manage
I promise that it ain't too much but just enough
Just the tip (x3)
I promise that it ain't too much, but just enough

[Verse 1: Plies]
Why you always making me beg for it?
We ain't even got to do nothing, just lemme put the head in
I ain't gon' move or nothing though, I'm dead serious
How about two or three pumps though, that's it
If I don't make it feel good at first, then I'll quit
Why you trippin'? Move your hand out the way real quick
Why you always laughing, kiking, and bullshittin'?
If you love me girl then let me do it, I'm just saying
Take 'em off or pull 'em to the side, stop playing
Tell the truth, I make it feel good every time
It's not my fault girl you shouldn't be so damn fine
Let me put in the though for the hundredth time
I ain't gon' keep on begging, I'mma ask you for the last time
You ain't got to do nothing, you can just lay there
You ain't got to throw it back or nothing, I don't even care
I don't even do you like that, you don't play fair
(Laugh) I know you gon' let me in there

[Hook: Jeremih]
Girl I don't mean to be mannish

Just the tip (x3)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
C'mon baby just let me put it in for a little while, that's it
I just want to put the tip in
Just enough for your body to skinny dip in
A little motion in your ocean
Hit a spot and concock you love potion
Shut off that commotion and listen hear
I want to get to bitin' like Tyson, nibbling on your ear
Whispering sweet nothin's, I can hear your heart beat pumpin'
Sending chills down your body
It's probably because you're my main squeeze
And my ice cream cone gives you a brain freeze
Yeah I be causing an avalanche
You might be calling an ambulance
Now I got you whipped, get a grip
Cause the tip of my dick will send your body into convulsions
You been working it all night girl
I think you deserve a promotion
