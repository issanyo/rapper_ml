[Intro: Plies]

If you know your city ‘bout that life, my nigga (2-3-9 nigga)
If you love your motherfucking city, my nigga
If you love your motherfucking city, my nigga
If you rep your motherfucking city, my nigga
If you rep your motherfucking city, let’s take niggas to your city (let’s go, nigga)


[Chorus: Plies]

You got to be a gangster, a grinder, a hustla, a rider
To even wanna survive in my city
This the home of the trappers, the lurkers, the pills, the merkers
All of us reside in my city, nigga
We getting money in my city, tote them thangs in my city
Red, blue, black, niggas bang in my city
I rep for my city, go to war for my city

[Verse 1: Plies]

Twenty-eight grams, thirty-six izzo
Two hundred flat’ll get you yoppa with the Ahoe [?]
Twenty-seven five what they taxing for the kilo
Young niggas round this motherfucka know they cutthroat
You ain’t got no work then stay the fuck up out the dope hole
Haitians got the blow, or get you loud from the Chico
Niggas in there all black, hoes in stilettos
Traps in my motherfucking city nigga gon’ close


[Chorus: Plies]

You got to be a gangster, a grinder, a hustla, a rider

[Verse 2: Plies]

Niggas in my city like to sell dope and fuck hoes
Niggas hug the block ‘till all they motherfucking shit sold
Shawty bend the corner with that ‘K, you better get low
Get low, get low--motherfucking pronto!
Niggas dumping bodies, have you floating next to Nemo
Nigga hitting licks and go to balling like they Nino
Nigga blowing money ‘round this bitch, nigga reload
Whip it, whip it on that motherfucking st-iz-ove


[Chorus: Plies]

You got to be a gangster, a grinder, a hustla, a rider
To even wanna survive in my city

We getting money in my city, tote them thangs in my city
Red, blue, black, niggas bang in my city
I rep for my city, go to war for my city

[Verse 3: Plies]

Seven days a week, you find niggas in the projects
Same motherfucking place where you can find them Glocks at
Heron and that dust at, shooters and them Glocks at
Nigga’ll rob your ass ‘round this bitch and make you buy back
Young hoes fucking round this bitch to the climax
Cu’ got them fat sacks, and we’ll make you get that
Getting paper, riding big ‘round this bitch the object
Young niggas in my city die for they respect


[Chorus: Plies]

You got to be a gangster, a grinder, a hustla, a rider
To even wanna survive in my city
This the home of the trappers, the lurkers, the pills, the merkers
All of us reside in my city, nigga
We getting money in my city, tote them thangs in my city
Red, blue, black, niggas bang in my city
I rep for my city, go to war for my city
I'm ‘a introduce you motherfucking niggas, introduce you to my city
