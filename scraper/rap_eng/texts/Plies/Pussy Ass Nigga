Ay, all the real niggas, dog
I got us, my nigga
Dog, I'ma tell you something, man
If you fuck niggas done wrote a song about another nigga, dog
And you ain't killed that nigga
You's a fuck nigga to me, man
You ain't a real nigga, dog
If you hate another nigga 'cause your motherfucking hustling game fucked up, nigga
And you can't get out of here and get it on your own, nigga
You ain't a real motherfucking nigga to me, nigga
If you've ever been on another nigga's discovery, dog
And then took the standing when laid down
And now you bike out of here on these streets, nigga
Once a fuck nigga, always a fuck nigga, dog
You can never be a real nigga to me, nigga
Show me a real nigga and I'll show you a thousand fuck niggas, dog
I'm certified, nigga
And a lot of you fuck niggas ain't, boy
I'ma make it too hard for you fuck niggas to breathe
If there's fuck nigga in you, I'ma get it out you, nigga
You ain't no real nigga, you a pocket watcher, fuck nigga
