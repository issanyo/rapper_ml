[Chorus]
Theres people in the world
Everyday they hide they problems
They don't want nobody to judge em
So they just keep it all inside of em
They smile when you see em
Cuz they don't want you to know nothin botherin em
But when they all alone they just cryin in the shower

[Verse 1: Plies]
Your bills done got behind gotcha scared to check ya mail box
Seem like err body askin for all the things you don't got
Err body depend on you
But you can't never get shit that they got
You did stuff for people
When you could have been helping yourself out
Your heart is good but it don't got you in some bad spots
You bills keep piling up, it seem like they won't stop
The economy done got bad, you ain't got money like you used to
But who seems to cares when all these bills and the rent due
And sometime it seem like hell you done been through
And sometimes your biggest critics are people you kin to
Why people judge you off the things that you didn't do
But you keep it to yourself, no body to turn to

[Chorus]
Theres people in the world
Everyday they hide they problems
They don't want nobody to judge em
So they just keep it all inside of em
They smile when you see em
Cuz they don't want you to know nothing botherin em
But when they all alone they just cryin in the shower

Theres people in the world
Everyday they hide they problems
They don't want nobody to judge em
So they just keep it all inside of em
They smile when you see em
Cuz they don't want you to know nothing botherin em
But when they all alone they just cryin in the shower

[Vers2: Plies]
Just had an abortion
Cuz she didn't wanna disappoint her family
Her momma always told her if she got pregnant she better be married
She ain't wanna do it but she was too afraid to have it
She ain't tell nobody including the dude that got her pregnant
This whole decision had been fuckin with her daily
And uh all she thinking bout is god gone hate me and uh
What he gone say about her decision making and
Cryin in the shower that's the only rest haven and
That's where she go when she wanna escape it
But to the rest of the world she just a innocent baby
So many innocent people in bad situations
And shes only 14 which makes it even more crazy cuz

[Chorus]
Theres people in the world
Everyday they hide they problems
They dont want nobody to judge em
So they just keep it all inside of em
They smile when you see em
Cuz they don't want you to know nothin botherin em
But when they alone they just cryin in the shower

Theres people in the world
Everyday they hide they problems
They dont want nobody to judge em
So they just keep it all inside of em
They smile when you see em
Cuz they don't want you to know nothin botherin em
But when they alone they just cryin in the shower

[Verse 3: Plies]
Everyday you wake up
With the pressure of the world on your shoulders
You tryin to provide for your family
But the world just keep getting colder
You just got news you lost your job
N feel like its over
On top that somebody just in yo family died
N u still ain't got that closer
It feel like you losing it
You tryin to keep your composer
You dealin wit it yourself cuz everybody so nosy
Yo eyes did got heavy your heart is just hurtin
On the outside your normal
But on the inside you cursin
With out your job you feel like a whole different person
N one thing you know is the devil workin
Can't let him defeat you
That's got you so determined
Don't let nobody judge ya cuz ain't nobody perfect

[Chorus]
Theres people in the world
Everyday they hide they problems
They dont want nobody to judge em
So they just keep it all inside of em
They smile when you see em
Cuz they don't want you to know nothin botherin em
But when they alone they just cryin in the shower

Theres people in the world
Everyday they hide they problems
They dont want nobody to judge em
So they just keep it all inside of em
They smile when you see em
Cuz they don't want you to know nothin botherin em
But when they alone they just cryin in the shower

Shower shower shower.....
