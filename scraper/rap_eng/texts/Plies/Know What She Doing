[Chorus]

Shorty know what she doing(x2)
Look how she get straight to it(x2)
Shorty know what she doing(x2)
Tell her how she moving(x2)
Shorty know what she doing(x2)
Look how she get straight to it(x2)
Shorty know what she doing(x2)
Tell her how she moving(x2)

The way she move her hips yea, remind me of a centipede
The way she like to ride yea, remind me of some jet ski
The way she pull her panties off, she stop them right to her knees
Before she take them all off she makes sure she looking right at me
Her skin soft just like a baby, fuck just like a grown lady
Hit her from the back, shhh she pop that ass and it be wavy…
She turn her head to the side, that’s I know she concentrating
And when she slap her own ass, that’s how I know she motivated

[Chorus]

She ride a nigga backwards, ha hands on my nuts
Her head titled bike, she looking straight up
She bouncing up and down, I'm putting it in her guts
She's squeezing on her titties, I'm squeezing on her butt
She told me talk to me daddy, so I'm talking to her rough
She say I'm in ha chest, I told her tighten up!
My hand's on her waist, I'm frowning all up, I told her hold up the peace sign, when she feel, she finna nut

[Chorus]

Her chest in the bed, ass in the air
Arch in her back, sweat in ha hair
Face in the sheets, legs open wide
Pussy got a glaze to it, creepy cream shine
Monkey sitting low, ass sitting high
Hand on ha clit, she moving it around
Finger in her pussy, she moving in&out
She breathing through her mouth, shorty showing out

[Chorus]
