Back to the gudda for the gudda
Back to the gudda
Finna take this real shit back to the gudda

[Verse 1: Plies]
I got my motherf*ckin board right now as we speak
So I’m sliding with my motherf*cking brother ID
I been riding behind tint
Dodging crackers all week
If they pull me in
I’m dirt, jumping out nah, don’t feat
I’ve been waiting on a nigga to put they hands on me
Got a .223 I’ve been dying to squeeze
Got a bet with my young niggas who gonna make the T
If a nigga that get outta line
That’s who ass it gon’ be
If a nigga that they ever say snitch on
They don’t trust em in that hoe
That they ever set poison on
Fuck em if he sweet
And he got the work, fuck it
I’mma touch her, she a hoe
And I know that she a hoe, ain’t cuffing


[Pre-Chorus: Jay 305]
Time to take this real shit back to the gudda
Hood rap crew step
Socking on bustas
Still on the block, posted up with the hustlers
Finna get this real shit back to the gudda

[Chorus: Jay 305]
For the gudda
Back to the gudd for the gudda
Back to the gudda
Finna take this real shit back to the gudda
For the gudda


[Verse 2: RJ]
Oh shit niggas hanging out
Shoot till my fingers sprung
I’mma bang it out
Oh that 40 on my peenie
My OG on that Fiji
He only been home for three weeks
Ah stuck between your bitch and a stash spot
You ain't a baller
You ain't the owner, you a mascot
And I’mma move the bitch
Put the work in her coochie lift
On God, I hit that bitch when she was cute
Now she smoked out
She sell her kids for them W2’s
She got no job
All the homies coked her, still banging her
Like the door knock in a dope spot
Like four tops
I put that on my soul


[Pre-Chorus: Jay 305]
Time to take this real shit back to the gudda
Hood rap crew step
Socking on bustas
Still on the block, posted up with the hustlers

Back to the gudd for the gudda
Back to the gudda
Finna take this real shit back to the gudda

[Verse 3: Jay 305]
That project bitch get nasty and fuck on Henn
Tat on her thigh of her ex-boyfriend
Shout out to my niggas doing time in the pen
It’s that gudda shit
Don’t spot, here I learn how to f*ck the bitch
Bout hunnid pushups, nigga f*ck a gym
Hold up, boop bop like Sharkeisha
And Dorothy get socked in front of a teacher


[Pre-Chorus: Jay 305]

Still on the block, posted up with the hustlers
