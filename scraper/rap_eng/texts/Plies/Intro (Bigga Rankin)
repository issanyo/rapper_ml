Check it, look at your watch, dog, and your cell phone, my nigga
And write the time and date down, my nigga
Y’all niggas just witnessed history in the making
Two trill niggas got together, dog
Plies, the new nigga at Slip-n-Slide, my nigga
And Bigga Rankin, dog, Cool Runnings DJs
Ay, Bigga, we finna make so hard for these niggas
Niggas can’t even move in Florida right now
If you ain’t, if you ain’t hollering at one of us, dog
You can’t even move in Florida right now, you feel me?

[Bigga Rankin]

Big Gates Records, Slip-n-Slide Records
It’s going down, nigga
This is how we do it, man
Bigga Rankin, the Cool Runnings crew, nigga
Get with me and holla at your boy
