[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Somebody call the doctor man (re-mix)
It's like them haters out there got a sickness man that need to be cured
Hey hey hater Hey hey hey hater
Hey hey hey hey hey hi hi hi hater
Hey hey hey hater, Hey hey hey hater
Hey hey hey hey hey hi hi hi hater
Hi hi hi hi hi hello hello hater (Remix come on man yeahhhhhhhh!!!)

[Verse 1: Maino]
Look, don't hide I see you hater
I'mma wave hi when I greet you hater
I've been dyin' to meet you hater
Please don't leave me I need you hater
This is for the ones that's been prayin I'm gon' fail
They hatin', rather see me back in the cell
But I ain't in the jail my nigga I'm doin' good
Brooklyn we did it I'm keepin' it all hood
Keep hatin' I'm rollin' I'm goin' past you
Chicks like "Oooh I like him you see his tattoos?"
(Go Maino) Look at me went from Smack DVD's to MTV
Pants hangin down on BET
Still in the streets nigga you see me

[Hook: Maino] (T.I.)
Hustle hard, stack paper, it's so right, y'all hate us
It's nothin, we major, you see me, hi hater
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater
Ay Maino, tell them haters get ready

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Ay Maino, tell them haters get ready
I ain't got time, too busy I'm flyin'
Over the Atlantics, three or fo' Hispanics
Strip dancin', no panties, askin' me to take advantage
Just imagine all the fun that I'm havin' (It's scary)
On average, I'm travelin', gettin that cabbage
Performin' in London, then I'm landin' in Paris (Hahaha!)
If I was you, frankly I'd be embarrassed
You carry no weight, words hold no merit
I talk big money, you can't understand it
My picture won't fit on yo' cameras
Go win two Grammys, build cribs for a few families
Then you can come back and holla at me
God dammit, it's sad but I could give a damn what a sucka think
Hustle hard, Grand Hustle, call us Hustle INC
Me and Maino, Jay'll ate it, just like brothers think
It's all about the music 'til it escalate to other things
Sucka seen the Bankhead-BK connection
You can hate it, but respect or else get dealt wit', bitch

[Hook: Maino]
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater

[Verse 3: Swizz Beatz]
OK OK, hi my name is Swizz, your name is, hater
So you see 'em, hi hater
On my watch, the Patek Philippe
I don't lose no sleep, cause I don't fuck with y'all haters
My car, the SLR, the engine tuned like it's a guitar
I'll leave y'all haters in the dust by far
I'm designin' planes y'all lookin' at cars (Lames)
Yeah! I try to keep the peace
If you keep talkin the hawk 'gon slide in 'em
What's up?! They all want the cake
But I'm a chef so I gotta show 'em how to bake (Get 'em)

[Verse 4: Plies]
Nine outta ten rappers - haters
They get emotional when they ain't got paper
When you get bigger than them then they hate ya
Fuck 'em cause I don't owe 'em no favors
When rappers hot, they praise ya
When rappers get cold, they spray ya
We smarter than most, ask my label
My first-week numbers, real major (Dayum)
Two hundred fourteen thousand sold, playa
Take by the minute now, half be my neighbor
I got a show, so I'mma talk to y'all later
Forty thousand a show - now hate

[Hook: Maino] (Jadakiss)
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater
(Hello How y'all doin?)

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
Yo, a million dollars worth of ice on
My wife beater show the pythons
Drug money kept the lights on, and besides the gunsmoke
The hate in the air is what kept the nights on
They gon' hate anyway screw bein nice to 'em
Till you send 'em some hot ones or you put the knife on 'em
Hi haters, it's me Jada
Might see me in the D with pink gators
Or I might be in the streets with three shakers
Ten head cracks in a row with sweet paper
Yeah I'm just tryin' to get my cash
The LP is on the way though, kiss my ass

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
I'm so NY, like the folks who make PlayStation
Yeah, I'm back, fresh off of hatecation
I let the haters take a break
Now I'mma let it out the bag like Jake the Snake
If it's one thing for sho', two things for certain
I'mma keep em up 'til my middle finger's hurtin
Naw, I ain't had a brush with beef yet
Some of y'all wake up hatin and ain't brushed your teeth yet
I come through, haters gotta know that I am paid
I be wavin' like I'm on the float of the parade
Hola, bonjour - hi hater
I keep it movin on hoes, call me vibrator
Los'

[Hook: Maino]
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater
