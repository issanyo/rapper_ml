Iono, bra
For some reason tonight I feel like
I can do what da fuck I wanna do

[Chorus x2]
Yea, I'm drunk plus I'm vibin'
Pistol in my pocket and I'm wildin'
Got all my jewelry on and I'm clownin'
Nigga, what da fuck you gon do about it

Got money, I can buy bottles
Keep one in the head this big forty
Take somethin' from me, I'm gon' off 'em
Fuckin' with me, it's gon' cost 'em
No, no, I ain't on blue dolphins
Yea, yea, the 'gnac got me talkin'
The big 'gar in my mouth keep me coughin'
'N all this cash keep me flossin'
Jewelry on, can't keep these hoes off me
Caked up, look how I'm walkin'
Fuck-nigga, cross me, I'm gon' spark 'em
Made-nigga, look how I'm bossin'

[Chorus]
Four stacks, I can get you killed
Real nigga, that's how I'm built
Stop waitin', I do not slip
Flaggin', will get you flipped
Choppa, ain't sold them there
Don't like me, I don't care
Care for what, I'ma millionaire
Tight jeans, somethin' I don't wear
Pistol, can't fit it in there
Fuck-niggas, somethin' I don't spare
Pussy, smells in the air
Stay strapped, go anywhere

[Chorus]
Yea, nigga I am him
No, I don't fuck wit' them
Rob me, naw, that's slim
'Cause goons, I got plenty them
Forty, knock off yo' limbs
Head shots, aimin' at yo brim
Fuck them niggas, I don't fear 'em
Kill that nigga when I see 'em
Money, buy one of you niggas
Ridin' with finga on my trigga
Sleep wit' a hand on my pistol
Made me kill one of you niggas

[Chorus]
