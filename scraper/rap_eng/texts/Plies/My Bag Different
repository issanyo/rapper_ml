[Verse 1]
Hi don't find Fendi
All I cup sale give me

I just like spending benzes
100 ground on a price tag
They better be pacific
All be floor ass thought of that ever grim me
She say my swagger note in my bag
I'll go and get my bag with all my burden is
That covered you is a mess
That did make you pay attention
We're talking dope turn baby call me sick chicken
I got a real thing I'm talking real things
I'm talking cat a bye baby I don't wanna fuck yo bag
I've got that I do whatever I wanna do kinda of money
Pull out a bit of that bi and they go respect your money

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I've got expensive taste I grab on me just in case
I might just say fuck it and fly out to Vegas today
I do not wait in lines, I do not beg for time
I do not offer baby too much money on my mind
They say don't trick it if you got it
I fell in love with deposits
She say I'm kinda cocky
No bitch I'm really positive
Going broke ain't my shit
Whipping in every pocket
Now about my land now
Where being even mock it
I want it and I will have it
I don't lay out with garbage
Hell I'm their favorite topic
My finesse is oh so lovely
My bag different
My bag different

[Chorus]
My bag different

My bag different
My bag different
My bag different
