I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
I rather be judged by twenty than carried by six
Before I let somebody take me out round this bitch
I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
OK, if you agree what I'm living mind on the edge
Is a difference, out here between bein smart and scared
A lot of niggers they thought they were sharp that wind up dead
And as young niggers I learn if u slipping den u wear it
If you're wild, then you think about shit before you say it
It's a certain type of nigga that shouldn't know where you're staying
And talk real but down we call that shit a spread
And a nigga to whack yo ass we call that puttin it on yo head
Remember pops said I take this war shit deeply
I close my eyes sometimes, and ask God I hope you keep me
To fear none to trust none nobody had to teach me
Define friends and love and these streets ain't what I'm seeking
Cause I ain't gonna let nan nigga hurt me
I rather do you, for I let you do me

[Chorus:]
I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
I rather be judged by twenty than carried by six
Before I let somebody take me out round bitch
I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
I'm living in a world where I ain't make up the rules
And the enemies turn up to be the people you knew
The niggers ya'll ain't thanking the ones you most approve
If you're making it, you do it, depends on how you move
Who play around yuh most you thought was cool
The niggers I watch the closest, the one I'm closest to
Their flag is in there face and that one if only knew
And if you think that shit a game out here that's when you lose
This war won't let nobody, if you don't believe that, you're a fool
When niggers get bread, they get confident, and they lose
More money, more problems, ya'll done heard that shit before
No modesty no problem you ain't got there, you know!
A nigga once told me they can't make everything count
Cause if a nigga catch you foolin he gone take your ass out

[Chorus:]
I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
I rather be carried by twelve than carried by six
Before I let somebody take me out round dis bitch
I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
Ain't nobody gonna make me talk cause my nuts
I'm a let 'em hang!
They lost a lot of my niggas, but I guess it's part of the game!
Try to explain it to their mommas, that shit is hard to explain
All the motion and the stress in these streets it will let you drain
When you're living it, you're breathing out here, don't feel your pain
But when you're dead and your gone they're treat you like you was a saint
Most people, when the pressure get on, they go in the tank
It's a sad situation to be out here n can't think
Cause shit can't get ugly, my nigga before you blank
And I'm a blow it off for my niggers before I drain
That's why when I wake up in the morning I give thanks
Cause it's a lot of niggers that wanted to wake up, but they can't
Cause ain't gonna let 'em niggers hurt me
I rather do you before I let you do me!

[Chorus:]
I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
I rather be carried by twelve than carried by six
Before I let somebody take me, I ride this bitch
I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
I can't let 'em bury me (I can't let 'em bury me)
