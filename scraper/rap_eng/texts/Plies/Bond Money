[Chorus]
I'm letting you pussy niggas know I got bond money
And I'll give all of mine to the bail bondsman
Before I let one of you fuck niggas out here harm me
It's whatever, pussy nigga, I got bond money
I'm letting you pussy niggas know I got bond money
And I'll give all of mine to the bail bondsman
Before I let one of you fuck niggas out here harm me
It's whatever, pussy nigga, I got bond money

[Verse 1]
And it's the reason, nigga, I hustle the way I do
'Cause I know what one of these fuck niggas will make me do
So I gotta have money that'll move me
'Cause if I don't, then these crackers gonna do me
My understanding for one of you fuck niggas is zero
And I'm robbing, I thought I'll let you nigga know
You niggas ain't thugging for real, you pussy niggas faking
And I'ma see what you 'bout when I start home invading
I'm a nigga with a lot of money and a little patience
And I know these streets gon' keep me in some situations
But I knew that 'fore I made thugging my occupation
But I refuse to be a pussy about this situation
So, hey, I went and bought me an A-K
And I'ma murk every fuck nigga in my way
I know you niggas gon' pull the crackers in it anyway
So I got bond money that's gon' move me the same day

[Chorus]
I'm letting you pussy niggas know I got bond money
And I'll give all of mine to the bail bondsman
Before I let one of you fuck niggas out here harm me
It's whatever, pussy nigga, I got bond money
I'm letting you pussy niggas know I got bond money
And I'll give all of mine to the bail bondsman
Before I let one of you fuck niggas out here harm me
It's whatever, pussy nigga, I got bond money

[Verse 2]
And you pussy niggas can't know who you fucking with
'Cause if you did, pussy nigga, you know I don't fake, bitch
You gon' make me pull it, nigga, and put it right in your face, bitch
'Cause I don't [?] with you fuck niggas in nann city
And I done earned all my respect off street credibility
It ain't a nigga out here that God made bulletproof
So when I hit you with that [?], that bitch going through
You better find me, fuck nigga, before I find you
And we can play it, pussy nigga, however you wanna play it
Or we can shoot it out till these crackers find one of us dead
And if you want to, you can put some money on my head
But whoever looking for me, nigga, I'm wherever it's swole at
'Cause half of you pussy ass niggas ain't never did nothing
But you want a nigga out here to think that you would do something
And I ain't finna argue with nann one of you fuck niggas
I swear to God, on a stack of Bibles, I'll kill one of you bitch niggas

[Chorus]
I'm letting you pussy niggas know I got bond money
And I'll give all of mine to the bail bondsman
Before I let one of you fuck niggas out here harm me
It's whatever, pussy nigga, I got bond money
I'm letting you pussy niggas know I got bond money
And I'll give all of mine to the bail bondsman
Before I let one of you fuck niggas out here harm me
It's whatever, pussy nigga, I got bond money

[Outro]
Ay, [?]
Big bruh, I need you to do me a favor
Get all my cash to B
B, I want you to go down there and open up a Slip-N-Slide bail bondsman, my nigga
'Cause I know these fuck niggas gon' keep me in situations
But like you told me, Snell, my nigga
I can do what I want to do
Count my [?] in front of these niggas whenever I want to
Drive my shit wherever I want to
'Cause you got me, nigga
And it's whatever on this end, nigga
Slip-N-Slide Records, pussy nigga
