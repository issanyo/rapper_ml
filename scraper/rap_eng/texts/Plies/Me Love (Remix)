[Verse 1:]
See The First Time Me Lookin At Your Eyes
Me Be Tell You Want A Guy Like Me
We Use To Have Gud Times On Da Evenin
Me An You Chillin On Da Beach
We Use To Kiss And Caress An Chess Me
Girl It Feels So Sweet
Den One Day You Move
Now I'm Feelin Kinda Blue
Cause We Had To See You Leave
I Feel Like I'm Drownin In Da Ocean
Somebody Come And Take Me Away

[Refrain: x2]
Uh Uh Uh Uh Oh Ooh
Why'd You Have To Go-Oh
Away From Home

[Verse 2:]
Now I'm Sittin In A Chair Wit Noone Here
An I'm Feelin All Alone
Thinkin To Myself Like
Damn Why My Baby Up And Gone
It's Like I'm Missin Her And I Know Shes Missin Me
It's Been Two Years An A Half In July Will Make It Three
I Feel Like I'm Drownin In Da Ocean
Somebody Come And Take Me Away

[Refrain: x2]
Uh Uh Uh Uh Oh Ooh
Why'd You Have To Go-Oh
Away From Home

[Verse 3: Plies]
Pliees!
I've Been Cheating So Long Baby I Thought It Was Legal
I Always Thought Good Sex Was Enough To Keep Yah
Risk Mah Whole God Damn High For A Skeeser
Momma Always Told Me Watch How You Treat People
Look Like The More Wrong I Did Her Feelings Got Deeper
Neva Thought She'll Leave But She Made Me A Believer
Can't Even Lie To You No More Baby Cause I'm A Cheater
I'm A Product Of The Streets And That's How They Breed Her
Can't Expect You To Be Stupid For Me Niether
You Deserve To Be Happy That's How I Wanna See Yah
I'm a Grant Yo Wishes And Give You Yo Freedom
Cause I'm Married To The Streets And I can't leave em'

[Verse 3:]
Why You Leave Me, Wuh Why You Leave Me
Baby Tell Me, Beh Baby Tell Me
Why You Leave Me, Wuh Why You Leave Me
Why You Leave Me [x2]

[Refrain:]
Uh Uh Uh Uh Oh Ooh
Why'd You Have To Go-Oh
Away From Home
Me Love. [x4]
