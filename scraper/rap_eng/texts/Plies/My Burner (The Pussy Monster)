[Hook: Mike Jones]
(I keep my burner)
Even though the law patrolling
Keep my pistol while I'm rolling
Can't let nobody jack me
I'd rather shoot than have them shoot me
(I keep my burner)
On my side when I creep
(My burner)
Under my pillow when I sleep
(My burner)

[Bridge: Mike Jones & Plies]
What up, homie?
This your boy, Mike Jones
This here is just a rough draft
You know what I'm saying?
I want you to get the feel of the track
You know what I'm saying?
I want you to get the hook in your head
And buy it so it'll tell me if you fucking with it
Holla at your boy!
MJ!
Hey, what's happening, baby?!

[Verse 2: Plies]
Just cocked my shit and put one in the head
Big foul when we got you walking bowlegged
Got the 40 on me, left the yappa on the bed
We can play it how you pussy niggas want to play it
I'm too real, little homie, they ever walk scared
I go to cribs and gon' be [?], ain't going fed
That's when they see me, when you leave, one of these niggas dead
And never pulled that motherfucker and then spread
When it's time to go to war, nigga, I'ma A-K it
On tote and if you don't shoot, [?]
Right under my tea is where I keep it hid
Niggas know that I'm the realest that is gon' get
