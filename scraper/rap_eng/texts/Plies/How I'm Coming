[Chorus]
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
They got on the jet
All Gucci luggage
If she ain't my bitch
Don't care who she fucking
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming

[Verse 1]
I must be a cooler
All of this ice
She might wanna fuck me
She said that I'm nice
Yeah like a zebra
I got stripes
If she don't wanna fuck me
She might be a dyke
I'm Von Miller
I got a sight
They went left
I went right
She wanna call me
I gotta flight
Give me a stick
You still know how to fight
Let me go right
Guess they don't mice
Give me your check
Don't give me advise
Out at McDonald
Real fucking dawn
I've been a lot of things but never beyond

[Chorus]
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
They got on the jet
All Gucci luggage
If she ain't my bitch
Don't care who she fucking
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming

[Verse 2]
Marching will hundred
I got them benz
You ain't a hater
Bitch you are a fan
Run off for the blow
I took a chance
You think it is sweet
I do it again
Exotic women
She gotta tan
Bored from home
She hit in
You with a mockingbird
Bitch I'ma dog
You breed as fuck
You're like a frog
Eyes are wanted here
Figure it out
Pussy was everything
I didn't tell
Fuck is you saying
Fuck is you saying
You trying remote silent
What the fuck is you playing

[Chorus]
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
They got on the jet
All Gucci luggage
If she ain't my bitch
Don't care who she fucking
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
You know I'm coming
