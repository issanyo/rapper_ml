Say guys, but I see I hung that base
Say guys, but I see I hung that base
Don't you got air for that
Y hell of a shape, it don't matter to me
If they real or fake
If you squeezing so but you say that I'm wrong
I let her put in my face
Gotta a thou get that one, I'mma make to buy it up
Yes she might get up, I try to put it with a gas
So take off

Look at how she griming it, met my only enemy
Only stack that giving she's fine, fine with cigarettes
All my dawg said she'd fool with it
But I know what to do with that
All my dawg said she'd fool with it
But I know what to do with it
I like them T-H-I-C-K (thick thick)
I like them T-H-I-C-K (thick thick)
I like them T-H-I-C-K (thick thick)
I like them T-H-I-C-K (thick thick)
She thick, she thick!

She thick in the thighs
Even thick in the rear
I ain't tryina cuff her and stay
I'mma tryina snatch her and dip
She can take it, I got her
I got a few extra chill
Take it straight to the flip, or take it straight to side feel
Lil' mama got a nice bottom, hit it good she will get halo
I wanna see with the vices on it
She's super thin like peanut butter
Plus she have that jelly, jelly
Take her to my tally
I won't see what you have tell
Then let me know you ready, take it
Look at how she griming it, met my only enemy
Only stack that giving she's fine, fine with cigarettes
All my dawg said she'd fool with it
But I know what to do with that
All my dawg said she'd fool with it
But I know what to do with it
I like them T-H-I-C-K (thick thick)
I like them T-H-I-C-K (thick thick)
I like them T-H-I-C-K (thick thick)
I like them T-H-I-C-K (thick thick)
She thick, she thick!

She fine & she thick
She don't make no sense
She bad and she swells
She desire the control
Gotta told 'em around then where does she go
And when she scream in MG-s you wanna see how it falls

T-H-I-C-K now sitting on my D-I-C-K
T-H-I-C-K now sitting on my D-I-C-K
While I look at how she griming it, met my only enemy
Only stack that giving she's fine, fine with cigarettes

All my dawg said she'd fool with it
But I know what to do with that
All my dawg said she'd fool with it
But I know what to do with it
I like them T-H-I-C-K (thick thick)
I like them T-H-I-C-K (thick thick)
I like them T-H-I-C-K (thick thick)
I like them T-H-I-C-K (thick thick)
I like them T-H-I-C-K bitch!
