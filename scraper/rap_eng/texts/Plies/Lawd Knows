Lord knows I ain’t living right
But I gotta get me some of this bread
Lord knows I ain’t living right
Without money out here a nigga dead
Lord knows I ain’t living right
But I gotta do what I gotta do
Lord knows I ain’t living right
With nothing going I heard a nigga through
Lord knows I ain’t living right
Lord knows, Lord knows
Lord knows I ain’t living right
Lord knows I ain’t living right
But I gotta get me some of this bread
Lord knows I ain’t living right
Without money out here a nigga dead

I take pity to the chase every day nigga
Just to get me some of this bread
If I did take none of these shits, nigga
I’m thinking might as well be dead
Some days don’t eat anything
Some nights don’t need sleep
But one thing I’mma do every day
Is try to get money in these streets
If I don’t do it who the fuck gonna do it?
Don’t nobody owe me shit
If I ain’t go and get it who gonna get it?
‘Cause ain’t nobody giving me shit
I remember when I was a little bitty boy
Remember hearing this from a lady
She said nobody can buy the labor pains
Motherfucker just wanna see the baby

Lord knows I ain’t living right
But I gotta get me some of this bread
Lord knows I ain’t living right
Without money out here a nigga dead
Lord knows I ain’t living right
But I gotta do what I gotta do
Lord knows I ain’t living right
With nothing going I hear a nigga through
Lord knows I ain’t living right
Lord knows, Lord knows
Lord knows I ain’t living right
Lord knows I ain’t living right
But I gotta get me some of this bread
Lord knows I ain’t living right
Without money out here a nigga dead

Ain’t gots to be thinking about nothing else
If you get money, nigga, go on
Ain’t got time to focus on nothing else
Told the same ol’ shit to my momma
Where I’m from being broke is a no-no
But the niggas with the money talk rough, though
If you a petty ass niggas you get the door closed
But the nigga with the money get the front row
Ain’t got time to think about a bitch leave
But I do think about how I’m gonna eat
‘Cause fucking with the wrong you going broke
But if you got the right plan, you can mop, though
Came now, motherfucker who ain’t got nothing going
Can’t tell me shit, I swear
But I wake up every morning, tell myself
Don’t be in these streets for your health

Lord knows I ain’t living right
But I gotta get me some of this bread
Lord knows I ain’t living right
Without money out here a nigga dead
Lord knows I ain’t living right
But I gotta do what I gotta do
Lord knows I ain’t living right
With nothing going I hear a nigga through
Lord knows I ain’t living right
Lord knows, Lord knows
Lord knows I ain’t living right
Lord knows I ain’t living right
But I gotta get me some of this bread
Lord knows I ain’t living right
Without money out here a nigga dead
