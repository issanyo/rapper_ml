[Intro: Plies]
It's Plies, baby (Plies, baby)
Ay, next time you see somebody homie
That's so bad that you can't resist them
Walk up to them and tell them you they #1 fan

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]
Hey I've been watchin' you all night (all night)
Since the DJ play that one song, I decided I had to make you mine (all mine)
I don't need no more convincing you got my attention (you got me baby)
I'm your number one
Your number one, I'm your number one fan
Your number one, I'm your number one
Your number one, I'm your number one fan
See you got me going, baby I can't explain it
Whatever you doin' is working, baby don't change it
(Eh, Eh) I'm your number one
I'm your number one, I'm your number one, fan

[Plies]
I like to salute you baby for recognizing swag
You still a virgin if a goon ain't something you ever had
Prefer mine out tha hood, but I respect class
Glad you didn't let me scare you how my pants sag
Guarantee off top, I'm better than your last
Good girls I love 'em, I like to turn 'em bad
One night I can make you forget all 'bout your past
When it's over be able to teach your own class
Opportunity of a life time, don't let it pass
Longer we wait tha better, we ain't got to move fast
For it's over my name gon' be on your car tag
Tha feelin' you lookin' for, baby I can give you that

[Hook: J. Holiday]
Hey, I've been watchin' you all night (all night)
Since the DJ play that one song, I decided I had to make you mine (all mine)
I don't need no more convincing you got my attention (you got me baby)
I'm your number one, (Your number one)
Your number one, (number one), I'm your number one fan (Ohhh Baby)
Your number one, (Oooo), your number one, (I'm your number one)
I'm your number one, (number one), your number one fan
See you got me goin', baby I can't explain it
Whatever you doin' is workin', baby don't change it
(Eh) I'm your number one
Your number one, your number one fan

[Plies]
Done seen a lot of things, done been all around the world
But never once have I met somebody this bad girl
I don't know if you a fan of mine, but I'm a fan of yours
Cute face and a pretty smile and nice curves
Couldn't even talk when I seen you, I was at a loss for words
Been your number one fan, ever since I seen you girl
Fell victim for you when I seen your body twirl
Couldn't sit back and wait, had to get to you first
Let you play in my bank account to see you splurge
All I can think about since I seen you is his and hers
You've been promised it all in a line you ain't heard
I'm your number one fan, I mean every word
