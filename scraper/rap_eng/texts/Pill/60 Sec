And I call it the formula of moderate response

The carelessness of convenience
- a social tool-
As it is in its present situation

My body congealed and dripping off of my major monuments
My body congealed and sticking to your fingertips
Despite being tied to the wire with a lack of relation

Who knows? No one cares, but it happened

It's the dance that all the kids have been talking about

We call this dance mass hysteria:
Put your hands behind my neck
- press swiftly -
To promote someone else’s revolution
Under the guise of my appearance

Reading warfare strategies in my travel magazines;
Maybe when the conflict’s over we should vacation there?

All those things that make you bad?
Who knows? No one cares, but it happened

Contemporary colonialism -
What a pretty thing I can buy for myself

Doing our part with minimal effort
