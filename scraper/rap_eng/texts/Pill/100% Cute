The dream of ruination-
Telepathy!
The dream of ruination-
Of letting you feel me!

My conscious shared
With yours / all lovers

My flesh smells best with you on top of me
-too slow too fast
-you bend I bow

And if i was true you’d see, you’d see me fall
If i was you I’d leave and see me push apart
If I was true I’d get what I want
If I say to you to stop, don’t follow me!

Be still my heart
And let my shudder be of comfort

Defeat, defeat, defeat me
I wither at the touch

You bend I bow
And let my shudder be of comfort

We can't predict the feelings of others
But we can make it soft

Defeat, defeat, defeat me
I wither at the touch
