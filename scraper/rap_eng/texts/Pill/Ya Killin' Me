[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Nigga you came lame, tryin' to obtain fame
Making a damn thing but Strange bringin' you samhain's rain
Put on blame game, when you in it lame, you can't tame
And bane mane with fags that's gonna bring insane pain

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (2X)
(It's so easy) God sent me here to punish you
(Believe me) I'm the wrong one to run into
(I'm breezy) They tell me ain't nobody cold as you
But you, you? Ya killin' me

[Verse 1: Pill]
You thought you was nice, but I got news for you, sorta kinda
But Pill twice as nice as Rice with the 49ers
Can't bring a horror houses, you softer than Dora pouches
Smoke a Joker quicker than Batman and torture spouses
Can't believe that you can't believe that you ain't as clean and cold as this
Drank so we might crank the speed but after we leave you get frozen up, with the lights on
You think that you tight cause you got all that ice on?
This the right song cause I finish beginners as soon as they turn my mic on, yep
But I’ll tell you this, fuck it, I’ll package and mail you this
Now open this letter, you hope it's lil' fellow
They told me to tap you and tell you quick, bitch!
This a mixture of a pistol and some liquor
Wrap your mouth around this barrel, guaranteed you drunk quicker, damn!
On some Smokey shit, it's friday with the coldest bitch
Poke a bitch shoulder then showed her the door and told her "dip"
Oh my bad, I didn't know that was your bottom bitch
I do the shit easy like after eatin' some cottage cheese, damn!

[Hook] (2X)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I feel this shit, I bust to my meal ticket
I'm up and I ill spit it, I fucks with the Pill nigglets
I'm real digits, be walkin' not ville live it
Even though that my scrill vicious
I'm painted up and still wicked
Fuck, my pen just took a big shit
I don’t give a fuck cause I'm gonna rip this
Everybody that call me devil is gonna get a plague
On their families, damnit, he's in the motherfucking red
Tech is sick of people's lack of acknowledgement
He was ripping before wack niggas got a cent
To the weak ones that stack up your dollars
Well, bustin' nuts is where I'm at cause I gotta vent
This industry can truly suck a booty
This rap is how I snap and hack a loogie, sucker sue me
Got straps right in the back, I pack a tooley for ya newbies
I crack your niggas hats for acting tooty fucking fruity
Laughing at you wannabes, I'mma hang nooses
For dudes that's useless, nigga that's fucking (Strange Music!)
We bang to the boogie, don't sleep on this
Stoppin' 'em, a nigga tryin' to eat with a beast
Wanna creep up on it but the beef gon' get
When you rapping niggas never speak on shit!

[Hook] (2X)
