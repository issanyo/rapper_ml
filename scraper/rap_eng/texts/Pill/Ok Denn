[Verse 1: Pill]
They say the phone goin' stupid, say the trap goin ham
They say 12 outside, ask me if I give a damn
Ok denn, you gotcha mind on some other shit
I'm 10 toes in tha trap tryna double it
Love a bitch? Hell naw, paper come before
Haters in the cut lookin mad cause I don't know ya
Fuck ya, you better get ya cash up
All this slick talk make a nigga beat ya ass up
Fresher than a tic-tac, I ain't with the chit-chat
Stay tooled up if a nigga want some get-back
Ok denn, we gon' get that on a stud bro
Represent ya side nigga gone throw ya hood up

[Verse 2: Pill]
Got this nine on my side, got my mind on the cheese
Feel like a nigga wanna try me just to see if I'mma squeeze
Please, nah, I don't really think you want it with me
Got the whole black the one-way and the corner with me
Ok denn, what they mad cause the hoes chose?
Fresher than the produce aisle, you in some old clothes
Zone 4, Allenville, zone 3, Pink City
Free my nigga Metro and Larow, I got the streets with me
Bank head the boy home, Sinsor roll it goin' on
Can't forget that fifth for all them boulevard blowns gone
Ok denn, I keep my mind on the sack of money
Finger on the trigger for them niggas wanna snatch it from me

[Verse 3: Pill]
Certified block poster, equipped with the Glock holster
Oh you don't believe me then? Well I gonna show ya
Pill hater smacker, club packer
Bad bitch attacker, call my nine milli tracker
Blood sucker, capische motherfucker?
Don't make me let this dog off the leash motherfucker
Ok denn, I got a pocket with a ringer that'll dingle
Nigga up and leave his wife livin single
Qudeesha (?) it's really nice to meet ya
Sorry that I made your husband have a fuckin seizure
Westsider, fourth war rider
Leave a nigga paraplegic off the enis clam chowder
