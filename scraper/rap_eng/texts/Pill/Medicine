Human music on the intercom
Play it again, play it again!

My sex life solved -
Haloed lights and purchase psalms

I can’t recall my face
But I know I love you

The aisle is a safe space
With no name and no number

MEDICINE, take it tomorrow

Come, the water’s fine and the war is over!
Come crawl down the aisle and meet me there
Trust me, trust me I’ll always buy
Come, the war is over and the radios are all playing!

MEDICINE, take it tomorrow

The War is over! The War is over!
The War is over! The War is over!
The War is over! The War is over!
The War is over! The War is over!

MEDICINE, take it tomorrow
