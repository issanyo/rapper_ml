Drone in the dark-

We asked for everything present from generation to generation
With no relation to the next

Torture for a sense of progress

Each time the sticky secretion slowly separating
-connectivity lost-
I have to put my fingers way up high to get any of the royal jelly

The security alarm goes off, but there is no intruder
Take the batteries out and come back to bed

Your face caught in the green orb of night vision surveillance

*A look of concern, but also ease*

Frame by frame
Repeating and duplicating;
A sense of control
