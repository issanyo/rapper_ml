I want you in my arms tonight
You know you whet my appetite
It might be wrong for us to care
And maybe something’s in the air
But if the world is unaware
It’s alright, please say it’s alright
You’ll be mine tonight, it’s going to be alright
I won’t care if we fall in love
I’ll be happy with the memory of
The thought of just one night of bliss
We can’t give up a chance like this
So just go on and whisper it’s
It’s alright…
I want you in my arms tonight
You know you set my heart alight
It can’t be like this everyday
And soon you’ll be so far away
So now I want to hear you say
It’s alright…
Don’t want to make a main feature with you
Ah but you know there’s a time and a place
You can’t resist it when you’re feeling it too
I can tell by the smile on your face
We both know that it will be OK
So don’t you let this moment slip away
Don’t have a problem when it’s all in the mind
Yes but we can make it very very real this time
