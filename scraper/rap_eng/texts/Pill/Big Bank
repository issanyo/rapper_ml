Big bank take little bank
Drop a in the fish tank
Got the sharks on lean
Fish scale for my whole team
Big bank take little bank
Drop a in the fish tank
Got the sharks on lean
Fish scale for my whole team

Watch that gonna pull up watch the pogo
Cake my birthday blow them
Candles baby please don't blow my
It's a band aid on your forehead I got people on my
On my pockets said release me to the sky
This is big bank talk make frequent as it is
Swear that money like the chili double hot

Dog tater chip bag
No sir, no shoes, no swag
I'll get cash, put that title by my name
Hottest lighters I'ma fire plus they gotta aim
I just left the title game
Don't they drove it trying to block me
I'm surrounded by this dollars
Big bank take little bank
Drop a in the fish tank
Got the sharks on lean
Fish scale for my whole team

I say at the Benjamins, pretty swimming in
And they ain't talking money
It's just my women friend
Pull up in the so sexy when the engine rim
It goes wrum, wrum, screw that
Cost like 7 birds
Cruise me down my swimming in that money
She say she don't like them bros
She in love with money
