[Verse 1: Pill]
Yeah, I put the H up in hard
While I'm signing in I [?] start
Prepare for the test, bubble MC's
Have a crack when the speed elevating, salivation
At the skill I won’t peal so it reeps
Come and get a slice, think twice 'fore you reach
Much less backing up
Harder than the bathroom tub
Harder [?]
Harder than some shit when you’re constipated
Harder than my dick fucking yo old lady
Harder than some seats on a bubbling bus
Harder than a street in the end of the test
Hot damn, high jam, 5 grams of harder
You whipping out the L's in the water
Who next? who flex? Break that dudes neck
Peel harder than that 2 ticks
18, make fiend, get deep with the throat
Hard like cheek on the flow
My nigga you might want to rock on a level
That probably get enticed on a level like me [?]
Hard not like white T
School days getting on the first
Eye blib, concrete
Now speak shit that’s granted
Harder than the capital states goddammit
Like wow, rifle, 3 stomps
Speedball that describe me
Lets just live right, need an IP
IV poison, when I get to nudge in
Followed up with the 9 guards
Who's Chuck Norris?
Hard like a motherfucking hardball
I get nervous, when I see a SWAT car
Hard! Let 'em go on the boulevard
Walk like already in a bouch of [?]

[Hook: Pill]-[X8]
I hope you sent your prayers to god
Cause motherfucker I’m hard

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Yeah, Harder than a baseball  to the jaw
Harder than a fall from a 20 foot fall
Kick a concrete football
In a pair of sandals from a 100 yards
Top hitting on mine and ya'll, thinking of mine and ya'll
Partying hard and ya'll, drinking a vodka ya'll
Give me the bottle motherfucker
A pirahna is underwater that’s right
It’s coming to kill me, in the river, stir liver
Crazy white boy, Pill’s the killer
Put me in a room with 32 dudes
With the word [?] and I'll still be iller
Can as Miller, can’t even load it
Did you notice plan this shift
Is it just me who will never get sleep
Cause I’m all around the world like Captain Silver
Yeah [?]
I got a sack of real world
How about a syllable [?]
That run’s on me, the next one comes with a fee
I’m kinda like a step daddy, if you come home late
The next one comes with a beating
I’ll pick ‘em up in a pickup truck
I'mma a pick a fight I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a half
Cause if I sit up in a quick ball
You could be the victim of a little bit of tie
Culturally influencing the Sean Carter way
Crossed over in the motherfucking game
Cause I whipped up in a harder way

[Hook]
