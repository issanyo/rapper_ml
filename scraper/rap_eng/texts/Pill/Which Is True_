And when I awoke
I emerged from a gilded egg on the shore;
Bare bottomed knees torn and
With my creativity stolen from me for another

OOOOO
Which is true?

It started from the bottom belly down

I always knew I didnâ€™t want to
But nobody ever asked
With a jury of 9 men and 3 women
The illusion must be something for which I asked

OOOOO
Which is true?

Our word is truth among Women
Our word is truth against myself

A story retold and refashioned:
There is no resolution
Only revolution
In the collected memories of our bodies
