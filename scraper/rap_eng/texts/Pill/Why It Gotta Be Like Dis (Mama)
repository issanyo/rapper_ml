Why it gotta be like this?
Why it gotta be like this?
I lost my baby and it's gonna drive me crazy
Why it gotta be like this?
Why it gotta be like this?
I lost my baby and it's gonna drive me crazy

[Verse One]:
Can't even eat right
Street life, ma don't even sleep nights
Thinkin' 'bout your tender loving care roamin' these street lights
He might, lose his fuckin' mind is what the people think
Keep a drank, drowning in my sorrows for the reason ain't
Enough time in this song to tell you how much I miss you
Tears falling at every wall that carries your picture
I remember them days, begging you please to stop
Your little son needed love but you needed a rock
Damn
But you made sure there was meals on the table for us
Can't even describe how I drew strength from your faith and glory
A story you told me that made me think
If you believe you can achieve, ain't no such thang as can't

[Hook]:
Why it gotta be like this?
Why it gotta be like this?
I lost my baby and it's gonna drive me crazy
Why it gotta be like this?
Why it gotta be like this?
I lost my baby and it's gonna drive me crazy

[Verse Two]:
Geraldine Carrie
Rivers it's been scary
Living without your presence but I know you up in Heaven
Smiling down on your child still chasing his dream
But I can't kiss your beautiful face and it's making me scream
The situation that I'm going through is making me tougher
Sometimes I bow and ask the lord why is he making me suffer?
Love ya
Like no other, I look up at the clouds
Hoping that you hear me clearly cause I'm saying it loud
How
Can I be a better man and make the right decisions?
I try so hard to be in charge of this life I'm livin'
I'm lonely, crying to myself sitting in the dark
One thing I promise is you'll always be within my heart

[Hook]:
Why it gotta be like this?
Why it gotta be like this?
I lost my baby and it's gonna drive me crazy
Why it gotta be like this?
Why it gotta be like this?
I lost my baby and it's gonna drive me crazy

[Verse Three]:
Colder as the day goes
Remember playing with Legos
Watching you in the kitchen cookin' chicken and potatoes
Ain't no, comparison to compassion and character
That you instilled in me, filled with things, helping me carry the
Load on my back, a book bag full of pain and grief
Almost three years since you've been gone, I'm still in disbelief
I miss the sweat reflections when you were stressing
Told me to smile, it'll get better, we'll receive a blessing
A lesson, to the wise, value your mother's every breath
Cause if she goes, you ain't got 'nother left
A lesson, value your mother's every breath
Cause if she goes, you ain't got 'nother left

[Hook]:
Why it gotta be like this?
Why it gotta be like this?
I lost my baby and it's gonna drive me crazy
Why it gotta be like this?
Why it gotta be like this?
I lost my baby and it's gonna drive me crazy
