I was dreamin bout a million x 4
I I I
I was dreamin bout a million X 4
I was dreamin bout a million
All I can do is dream
'cause I ain't happy here
All I can do is dream
'cause I ain't happy here
All I can do is dream
'cause I ain't happy here
I woke up from a dream same things that I went used
Feel like I was getting high chillin out in a new suit
And like though
Try to fantasize as we last
Delete the pain from your system but is still arrive
See my mama hit the pipe until my room crack
Got lose that my uncle bro until room is die
I'm talking that we win the court game until the ..
Without a stress on your brain can you survive
And that's my brother, love like no other
Wishing for a father asking why you left my mother
Project life take a tow but together whole on me
I'm screaming f*ck it ain't no nigga for tole on me
I'm getting old and school is just a place to eat
Get on my knees the extra lord meant away from me
I see the Lord and they sayin there ain't safe for me
I go to church is the extra..pray for me yeah

All I can do is dream

All I can do is dream
'cause I ain't happy here
All I can do is dream
'cause I ain't happy here
All I can do is dream
'cause I ain't happy here
I swept you on the crack of dawn and call of my eye
Ask the Lord last..would you take my soul if I die
But I wonder every time I go in this ..
Will I wake up or will the Lords gonna take me under
Break the ..and stronger is I ever knew
Tuffer than Bill strap jeans and some other boobs
Well I become what I dream of ..
Has been soul alcoholic mother f*cker
I see the future and it seem a little brighter
Then it's unrealistic dark to em weather
Please just give a nigga a little ..shy
A couple movie days, a little wine and dime
And ..will be find the things
Fast the hotel make some diamond rings
I go to sleep and try to dream of a better life
I'm whipping ..for my brother to let this..white

..last night
Was a dream or desperate life
I woke up from a dream last night
Was it a dream or a desperate life
