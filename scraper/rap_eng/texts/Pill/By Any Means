[Hook: Rick Ross]
Fork on the floor, white in the pot
By any means, if you like it or not
Malcolm X, by any means
Many 14s stuffed in my denom jeans
As-salamu alaykum, well, alaykum salonne
Whatever your religion, kiss the ring on the don
Real nigga, street surtified
Hit the streets, wip caussts 335

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly!
No park on the 4, but it's white in the pot
We charging you niggas up if you like it or not
Drop the work on the skailes, thro some ice in the pot
Don't let that arman hammer go right to a lot
Tryna wip a rolli, all Cardier
Shout out to this pirax, and put this on the mear
Who tought me audomor, my whole team got them
You lovin the same bitch my whole team toppin
100 though, Imma be wherever that money go
Glocc 9 in my underclothes, new cartell, we workin for him
Fuck niggas, we don't fuck with those
Bad bitches, never let them know
Keep them round, but never trust them though
This 62 so comfortable
I'm a field nigga, you's a house nigga
I'm a real nigga, and you's a mouse nigga
Coad red, which means you coad red
But I'll knock you out this, blame it on you old heads

[Hook: Rick Ross]

[Verse 2: Wale]
Wale though!
Malcolm X, get yo head out my pocket
Some niggas walk with death, guess they ran out of options
Tell them niggas we movin, tell them niggas to do it
I sware we going ham, hope some them niggas sue me
Naibor on every block, this bitch ain't got no heart
Shit ain't really same, since Ronald Raigan banned rock
And we ain't land on it, Mr. Raigan
But this gonna make us rich, Mr. Raigan
Wale like them Salom
She see me Friday, then go to Shamon
When I play with her box, she give the greatest top
She say these niggas is her pray, and she makes a lot
Word, how they say we not fly
How they say we not work
They just need convincing like Malcolm Little, before he converted
I'm on my Dean Sha-la, Imma get her right
On the bible, you can run, but you can't hide

[Verse 3: Pill]
Marching for cars, they put a hole in it
Start the applause, a rebble so lifted
For the paper, the poperotzi so relished
For the mascot lives, teachers do sharades
That's Malic, one behind the brass
Kuruption over cans, leave him leaking in the gass
Better remember, smell that chetter and sills
?
My religion is kitchen, par performers
My pockets ain't normal
Pholosify is rocks and weed, pot to lean, glocc to scream
Niggas clocking dollars, don't know how to read with mouths to feed
