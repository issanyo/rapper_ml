Is it wicked?
Can I lick it?

Would you taste my bloodied knee?
Testing the limits of intimacy

Round knuckle trying to temper my desire
But the drain builds pressure

There is no ally in this void
There is no ally in this void

Constructing history constructing empires
Constructing history constructing THE EMPIRE

All you dead boys;
I’m a girl’s girl

Who draws the shape and what bends it?
A funeral pyre

Press in deep and make it count

All you dead boys;
I’m a girls girl

Pretty cool, cool
Pretty cool, cool

Let me absorb as much as I can;
Let this wash over me

All you dead boys;
I’m a girl’s girl
