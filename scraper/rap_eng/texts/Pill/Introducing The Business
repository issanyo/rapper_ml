[Chorus: Pill]
This is The Business, prepare to take witness
To the type of ish that we on, we on
By the time that you get there, we already been there
We done packed up and we gone, we gone, we gone
This is The Business, prepare to take witness
To the type of ish that we on, we on, we on
'Cause this is The Business right now
Come witness The Business right now

[Verse 1: Pill]
Okay then, and you can take some notes from me
Grab a cheat sheet, take a couple quotes from me
You won't defeat thee Business
You're better off trying to get the stank off of chitlins, ya kidding?
So grab a suit and tie, salute the guy, take a seat
We'll review your resume and see just what we have this week
But in the meantime, make sure you log on
To markronsonandthebusiness.com
Yeah, let us build a better life with ya
Submit your application and we'll be right wit ya
And for the ladies, make sure you send us a nice picture
Beside the right qualifications and we might pick ya
Okay then, let's keep this strictly professional
Take my business card and call at respected hours
This is larger than what large is
The true definition of what being in charge is

[Chorus: Pill]
This is The Business, prepare to take witness
To the type of ish that we on, we on
By the time that you get there, we already been there
We done packed up and we gone, we gone, we gone
This is The Business, prepare to take witness
To the type of ish that we on, we on, we on
'Cause this is The Business right now
Come witness The Business right now

[Verse 2: Pill]
This the type of business that you could put your nose in
Pack a big enough bag that you could fit some clothes in
Long hours, dozin', gotta get them figures straight
Young Lamont Dozier, I'm working on some real estate
Or Chris Blackwell, gotta get them stacks well
United States Postal Service lame, we stack mail
Save some instruments, 'cause we'll give you the blues, hater
On your front porch in the morning like the newspaper
And the headline is that we runnin' shit (Yo)
And we the exact crew that you don't wanna hate (Okay)
And the headline is that we runnin' shit (Yo)
Introducing The Business, The Business

[Chorus: Pill]
This is The Business, prepare to take witness
To the type of ish that we on, we on
By the time that you get there, we already been there
We done packed up and we gone, we gone, we gone
This is The Business, prepare to take witness
To the type of ish that we on, we on, we on
'Cause this is The Business right now
Come witness The Business right now
