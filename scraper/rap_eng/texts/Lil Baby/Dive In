[Intro]
Yeah
Cook that shit up, Quay
Ain't been in the studio for like three or four weeks, you know what I'm sayin'
I been caught up in some mo shit, you dig
Okay, okay, okay, okay

[Chorus]
Jump off the jump rope, I'm tryna dive in
Quarter million dollars all on my skin
Tote this F&N like I got license
Fuck stop signs and red lights, I don't do no stoppin'
Jump off the jump rope, I'm tryna dive in
Quarter million dollars all on my skin
Tote this F&N like I got license
Fuck stop signs and red lights, I don't do no stoppin'

[Verse 1]
I used to trap out the store
I ain't have nowhere to go
I had a pound in my coat
Payin' J's to watch out for the folks
Hit the stick like I'm playin' Madden
Should I do it, nigga couldn't imagine
Skippa Da Flippa, young nigga havin'
I get the money, I don't do no dabbin'
Maison Margiella on Monday, I rock Givenchy on Tuesday
Wednesday I rock Ferragamo, Thursday I'm wearing my Louis
Friday I come out in Fendi, I got bitches tryna do me
Designered down, I be groovin', livin' life like a movie
You can't stand next to me

[Chorus]
Jump off the jump rope, I'm tryna dive in
Quarter million dollars all on my skin
Tote this F&N like I got license
Fuck stop signs and red lights, I don't do no stoppin'
Jump off the jump rope, I'm tryna dive in
Quarter million dollars all on my skin
Tote this F&N like I got license
Fuck stop signs and red lights, I don't do no stoppin'

[Verse 2]
Lil nigga but my shirt off
Pull up with the pack and skrt off
Niggas softer than a Nerf ball
I ain't never heard of none y'all
Niggas say they really in the streets
Why I ain't never seen you in the street?
Bitch you can go and ask about me
They'll tell you that I'm really in the streets
I don't give a fuck about making no song
I was standing in the spot, tryna work my phone
Had to do it on my own, lil nigga I'm grown
You can hate from afar just watch your tone
Do anything for them racks
I used to sleep with them roaches and rats
They tellin' me I should rap
I'm tryna get off this pack

[Chorus]
Jump off the jump rope, I'm tryna dive in
Quarter million dollars all on my skin
Tote this F&N like I got license
Fuck stop signs and red lights, I don't do no stoppin'
Jump off the jump rope, I'm tryna dive in
Quarter million dollars all on my skin
Tote this F&N like I got license
Fuck stop signs and red lights, I don't do no stoppin'
