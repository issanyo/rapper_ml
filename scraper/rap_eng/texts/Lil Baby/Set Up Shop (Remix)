[Intro: Young Thug]
Ayy man, I been a rich nigga, know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't had no plug, know what I'm sayin'?
Lil Baby, digit time nigga
Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus: Marlo]
Set up shop
Nigga fuck the cops, I got plenty guap
Young Roo act a damn fool with that damn tool
We the gang, nigga try the gang, nigga bust his brain
Bitches lame, niggas droppin' names, that's a damn shame
Bitch wait, fuck a mixtape, I got plenty cake
Yeah I'm rich and I'm pushing weight, that's why niggas hate
Bad bitch, she done sucked me up for them brand new J's
Trap nigga, six phones, doin' at least a brick a day

[Verse 1: Marlo]
Slaughter gang, snatch your chain, dirty face, dirty K
Hundred thou in put up, I got this from the cook up
Sixty two to one-twenty-five, I doubled up
Switchin' lanes in the Hellcat, I done did that
Flip packs, I got big racks, where your bitch at?
Niggas broke, bitches stressed out, I can't help that
Real nigga, I talk brick talk, bet they felt that
Dope money turnt to rap money, watch how I flip that

[Chorus: Marlo]

Bad bitch, she done sucked me up for them brand new J's
Trap nigga, six phones, doin' at least a brick a day

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Young Baby, goin' straight crazy, worth like four-eighty

Young nigga get a lot of money, all these bitches jocking
Pussy nigga say they wanna rob me, guess that's why they watchin'

Shoebox, fuck a shoebox, that ain't big enough
Big racks, I got big racks, where your bitch at?

[Chorus: Marlo]

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Marc gators on my feet like I just stepped up out the swamp
I wanna be a billionaire, I ain't got no problem with Donald Trump
Lookin' sad, on a med, mixin' Act with Hi-Tech
I got way more water than Katrina 'round my fuckin' neck
I fucked that bitch like a pit
I told her her boyfriend a piss
Hundred-fifty thousand dollar bitches on deck
Set up shop, and I got some red in the red rock
Actavis make me sit it down like I can't walk
Go to that skirt, it's a box
Stand up guys get slaughtered
I can never be like Quan
Ranned up way too many coins
Anyway I act flamboyent
Nigga been a gangster since born
Nigga killed theyself, I warned
Niggas goin' broke and it's showin'

[Chorus: Marlo]
Set up shop
Nigga fuck the cops, I got plenty guap
Young Roo act a damn fool with that damn tool
We the gang, nigga try the gang, nigga bust his brain
Bitches lame, niggas droppin' names, that's a damn shame
Bitch wait, fuck a mixtape, I got plenty cake
Yeah I'm rich and I'm pushing weight, that's why niggas hate
Bad bitch, she done sucked me up for them brand new J's
Trap nigga, six phones, doin' at least a brick a day
