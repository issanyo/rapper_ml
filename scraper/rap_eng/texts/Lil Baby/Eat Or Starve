[Intro]
Cook that shit up Quay

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I come from the 'partments it was bad
Ramen noodles, cup of water all we had
It's like you gon' eat or you gon' starve
Either you gon' hustle or you rob
Never had no hoop dreams, but I always wanted to ball
Ever since a jit I knew I was gon' be rich
Never though it'd be like this
But now I got the money, so every day we lit

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
By the time I turned 10 I was running wild
Listening to Juvenile
Staying at my grandma house
My mama got put out
I've been through some shit that you would never know
But I keep a smile, I can't let it show
I was 15 Jock and Dee, caught a murder case
Runnin' with the robbers, man I know we upped the murder rates
I was sittin' in jail when Lil' Man got shot in his face
Damn that shit bad, they say that's my neice dad
Brian got killed
That shit crazy
You can't listen once you here
They tried to say we made the hit, but lookahere
I love that nigga like my brother, that's for real
That's for real

[Chorus]
I come from the 'partments it was bad
Ramen noodles, cup of water all we had
It's like you gon' eat or you gon' starve
Either you gon' hustle or you rob
Never had no hoop dreams, but I always wanted to ball
Ever since a jit I knew I was gon' be rich
Never though it'd be like this
But now I got the money, so every day we lit

[Verse 2: Rylo Rodriguez]
25 cent froze cups in the hood
Me and Tyrone playing nick-a-knock in the bricks up no good
Had a walkie talkie watching for the 12 tryna make a sale
Lil' Joe ain't even kill nobody, but he got life in jail
Perkys get you by
Them youngins knock 'em down
[?] to my phone when you got back in town
They see me on the stage now, though I ain't get a cap and gown
Want me to hit it raw dawg
200 for that pussy, gee baby don't you play hard ball
Lil' Pooh them bring them rods out
Ice on me, can't thaw it out
Fuck this drink might pour it out
Chain look like I'm showing out
Xans, but I ain't goin' out
Sales coming in and out
We just tryna sew the block
Grandma found my stash spot and she tried to throw me out

[Chorus]
I come from the 'partments it was bad
Ramen noodles, cup of water all we had
It's like you gon' eat or you gon' starve
Either you gon' hustle or you rob
Never had no hoop dreams, but I always wanted to ball
Ever since a jit I knew I was gon' be rich
Never though it'd be like this
But now I got the money, so every day we lit
