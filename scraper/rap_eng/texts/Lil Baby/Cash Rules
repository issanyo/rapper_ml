[Intro]
Get a cup dog we can pour up now
Cash rules everything around me

[Chorus]
I want all the dollars
I want all the green
I want Ferragamo, Gucci, Louis, Robbin jeans
Play with me that drummo will have you restin' in peace
Cash rules everything around me
Cash rules everything around me

[Verse 1: Gabriel Tirado]
I just blew a check like like I ain’t worry bout it
Masson Marengo I just bought my bitch some red bottoms
If a nigga try me I’ma red dot him
Take him off the streets like the feds got him
Nigga I ain’t stopping until I get the gwallo
Drippin like water fountains I’m rockins Ferragamo
Moneybag lets count it on the counter
Or brick the cash call it round the dollars
Your small fries i’m a big dog like Rottweiler
Nigga money talk if the money call like I know the phone when your bitch callin'
Grow this shit I’ve been on it
Gas gas pack go real fast
They wanna know what I spend on it
Enough to get your bitch back
I want all the dollars, nigga my jeans is Robbins
Gucci and some Louis
My life is like a movie
I just coped a Rollie
I guess I was chosen
And cash rules everything around me

[Chorus]
I want all the dollars
I want all the green
I want Ferragamo, Gucci, Louis, Robbin jeans
Play with me that drummo will have you restin' in peace
Cash rules everything around me
Cash rules everything around me

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Cash rules everything around me
I was stuck in the bottom they tried to down me
In the middle of the projects is where they found me
Yeah, I be everywhere those pounds be
Cuban links heavy had to take them off
For the ride I lost it all I had to take them off
Everything dripped up, every chain dripped up
They say that they got murder for hire
Get 'em filled up
Going through a faze, my life inside a maze
I know I see better days, yeah that shit had finally came
Man we finally gettin' paid
They taken swag I give them game but, they don't put credit on my name
I had paper before the fame, that shit will won’t change me
I should pull up in projects, I’m the same me
And I’m still running with the same dudes
Cash rules everything around me

[Chorus]
I want all the dollars
I want all the green
I want Ferragamo, Gucci, Louis, Robbin jeans
Play with me that drummo will have you restin' in peace
Cash rules everything around me
Cash rules everything around me

[Verse 3: Gabriel Tirado]
Every sense and youngans bitch I’ve been a target
Now they haten on me because i’m gainin knowledge
I be paper chasing call that money moving
Jumping out the rover chains lookin stupid
Lets get to the bag, i’m stacking it up, its making them mad
Not giving a f**k, i’m blowing the gas, i’m doing the dash, they wishing I crash
I’m swimming in hundreds, im taken them down, my verses the hottest they wanna calaps
They work from the bucket these niggas is crabs
They wanna keep bustin' and smoking that loud
Counting up in the money count in up that's a hundred thou'
Rubber band run a dead in a haunted house
Designer shit it’s custom made it ain’t even out
I’m the realist than they ain’t seen a damn but they see it now
And nigga I ain’t stopping, gotta forever popping, my niggas right behind me
Rushing like tsunami, ok now we lotting and hoped in about the foreign and
“cash rules everything around me”

[Chorus]
I want all the dollars
I want all the green
I want Ferragamo, Gucci, Louis, Robbin jeans
Play with me that drummo will have you restin' in peace
Cash rules everything around me
Cash rules everything around me

[Outro]
Cash rules everything around me
Cash rules everything around me
Cash rules everything around me
