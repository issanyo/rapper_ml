[Intro: Lil Baby]
Cook that shit up, Quay
Take off, take off

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Stay down, get that money, take off (take off)
Got three hundred bands in a Goyard (Goyard)
All my niggas know it's go hard
If I send the word they gon' come and take your face off (face off)
I ain't never gon' stop (nah)
Guarantee I'm gon' pop (I'm gon' pop)
Drop an album, I won't flop (I won't flop)
Standing on the stage, I'm a star (star)
This shit wasn't easy, I had to work hard

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Goin' to school in a hotbox
They killed my nigga Juan, damn near broke my heart
I'm goin' number one when I hit the charts
Riding 'round with a lot of money so I keep my Glock
I blew up super fast, guess that's why they mad
Touch my chain, murder scene, body bag
I do this for all the shit I never had
Gotta be her for my niece, ain't got no father, I'm her dad
You remember we was skipping school
Going on the move, fucked around and made the news
I'm so glad we didn't get caught
Looking back on it, I'm like damn I came far

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Stay down, get that money, take off (take off)
Got three hundred bands in a Goyard (Goyard)
All my niggas know it's go hard
If I send the word they gon' come and take your face off (face off)
I ain't never gon' stop (nah)
Guarantee I'm gon' pop (I'm gon' pop)
Drop an album, I won't flop (I won't flop)
Standing on the stage, I'm a star (star)
This shit wasn't easy, I had to work hard

[Verse 2: Snap Dogg]
Stayed down and came up, had to get my change up
Only fuck with day ones, hell nah we can't change up
Niggas ain't clutching for real, niggas ain't toting the steel
Niggas ain't working for real, all of my niggas want M's
They love when I'm up in the booth
They know that I'm speaking the truth
They feeling my pain, this shit is insane
They know when I'm telling the truth
For the change I'll blow off your roof
And your partner, he gettin' it too
It's a tag on his head, green light on his ass
Hell yeah, go kill his whole crew
I done came up in the city and these niggas wanna hate
I can't fuck with niggas 'cause they really turned snake
I ain't got time for these hoes
I'm on the road doing shows around the globe

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Stay down, get that money, take off (take off)
Got three hundred bands in a Goyard (Goyard)
All my niggas know it's go hard
If I send the word they gon' come and take your face off (face off)
I ain't never gon' stop (nah)
Guarantee I'm gon' pop (I'm gon' pop)
Drop an album, I won't flop (I won't flop)
Standing on the stage, I'm a star (star)
This shit wasn't easy, I had to work hard
