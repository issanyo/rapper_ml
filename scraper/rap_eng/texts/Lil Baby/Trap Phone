[Chorus: YBS Skola]
My trap phone ringing, my shit banging
I love to ride through the block and see 'em jamming
I hate them niggas that be bluffin' on they scamming
You know that you ain't risk your life to get them Balmains
My trap phone ringing, my shit banging
I love to ride through the block and see 'em jamming
I hate them niggas that be bluffin' on they scamming
You know that you ain't risk your life to get them Balmains

[Verse 1: YBS Skola]
We was starving, now we balling
Like we Spalding, Rollie blinding
Bought twenty out, AP shining
YBS, we them niggas, we put the grind in
I know I spent at least a half a mil on fuckin' clothes
And ain't a drug that you can mention I ain't fuckin' sold
I turned my go-getter on silent when I'm doin' shows
If rappin' don't work then you know I'm back to selling O's
Back on the block with bro
Back capping double O's
Back ducking 5-0
Lettin' these niggas know
That this my block and yeah I got the plug, let's get him gone
As long as everybody complies, he gon' send 'em all

[Chorus: YBS Skola]
My trap phone ringing, my shit banging
I love to ride through the block and see 'em jamming
I hate them niggas that be bluffin' on they scamming
You know that you ain't risk your life to get them Balmains
My trap phone ringing, my shit banging
I love to ride through the block and see 'em jamming
I hate them niggas that be bluffin' on they scamming
You know that you ain't risk your life to get them Balmains

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I ain't no scammer, I ain't ever used no fucking card
I swear to god, I paid cash for everything I got
Flip phone ringing uncontrollably, I control the streets
Made a couple thousand off Verizon, now they notice me
Keep my head up like my nose bleedin'
New pieces for the whole team
Ain't goin' back to the old me
On that gang shit like Grove Street
Used to play the San Andreas, now we live like San Andreas
Tryna make it to the mall, every day duckin' feds
Keep switching my lines, I don't know if my phone's tapped
Like fuck it 'cause that's all I know, grind hard or stay broke
Nappy head nigga runnin' 'round throwing fours
Got some niggas sittin' in the prison, they ain't said a word

[Chorus: YBS Skola]
My trap phone ringing, my shit banging
I love to ride through the block and see 'em jamming
I hate them niggas that be bluffin' on they scamming
You know that you ain't risk your life to get them Balmains
My trap phone ringing, my shit banging
I love to ride through the block and see 'em jamming
I hate them niggas that be bluffin' on they scamming
You know that you ain't risk your life to get them Balmains
