I get bags in for the low and send them to the Southside (yeah)
Yeah, I'm sellin' coke for real
I put the "d" in dope for real
Saint Laurent on my coat for real
That Draco, that Draco (Draco)
I'm with Derez in Clayco (Clayco)
Shoutout to Clayhead, that nigga a real one
We had them bands in the neighborhood (neighborhood)

[Verse 1]
Temp fade, new J's (new J's)
All day, catch plays (plays)
White tee, dope boy (work)
Move that dope, boy (dope boy)
Trappin' out a bando (bando)
Servin' out a window (window)
Tryna run our mills up (M's up)
That's what we pay the rent for (M's)
Fuck it up in the Gucci store, them M's in (M's in)
Bad bitch lookin' like Bernice, I call her Slim Jim (Slim Jim)
I just want push start on my car
Shoutout the hood, they know I'm a god
They know what we  bang wherever we are
I just took these cuts on stage
Look at these VVS's in my chain
I'm doing better, I can't even complain (nah)
Bought it plain, then I blew out the brain (brain)
Birkin bag, make the bitch go insane ('sane)
With the gang, I ain't switchin' the name (name)
Paper tag, got me switchin' these lanes (lane)
Do anything to get me some chains
These niggas be fuckin' for fame (fame)

[Verse 2]
I'm doing shit that they wishing they could (yeah)
I'm the frontrunner, burning right through the hood (yeah)
They hated on me, but it's still all good (yah)
Draco on me, and it's still all wood (yah)
I'm on probation, they let off a fool
They on my drip, tryna see what I do
They takin' notes, tryna study my moves
They tryna do what I do (what you doin'?)
All-Star weekend, I was gettin' the pack in
Heard you got your shit took, nigga you lackin'
Big body Benz "beep, beep" when it back in
Real street niggas buyin' bags with the backends
These niggas ain't authentic, they actin'
And I ain't get to the money, they cappin'
What happened? (huh?)
I thought you was a real one? (nah, nah)
Solitary stones in my ear, these the clear ones (clear)
These diamonds dancin' too loud in my ear, so I don't hear them (hear them)
My homie got the stick, I got the glizzy
We don't fear them (nah)
These niggas don't wanna play with us
I swear that we gon' kill them (fa)
