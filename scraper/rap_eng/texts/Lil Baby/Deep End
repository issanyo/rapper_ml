[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay
I know they ain't feelin' my pain
I got codeine inside my veins, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill
We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense
He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in
Lil homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end

[Verse 1]
They offerin' the shooter the death penalty, won't tell on me
I know if I go broke today, them same hoes gon' bail on me
I got them throwin' salt, they steady tryna fuck up my recipe
Amiri jeans, a hundred a pair, ain't nothin' about a nigga cheap
Sellin' weed in the projects, relapsed on the Hi-Tech
Told the gang that we up next, put 'em on a G5 jet
Overseas with my sidepiece, my queen, she gotta be a dimepiece
We gon' stick together like assigned seats, on that Dej Loaf, nigga, try me
Whoever thought I'd put a hundred on my neck?
Whoever thought that I'd say I'm the one up next?
Whoever thought they'd ever consider me the best?
Whoever thought, whoever thought, whoever thought?

[Chorus]
I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill
We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense
He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in
Lil homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end

[Verse 2]
Go and ask about me in the streets, they heard of me
If she find out I been creepin', she gon' murder me
I ain't trippin', no complaints, I got my currency up
Out of town, I let the windows down so they can see us
I take the hitters around the globe, that's all I know (That's all I know)
I met her last night she tried to give me her soul (Give me her soul)
I got 'em hatin', they throwin' shots, they on their toes
One thing they know (One thing they know)
One thing they know (One thing they know)
Ain't gon let up on them niggas, once you try us, ain't gon' stop
If it's pressure, let me know, so we can pull up with them Glocks
Tryna dodge the bullshit and tryna make it to the top
If I never sell a record I'ma make it on the block
How you gon wait 'til I make it then try to help me? Nigga I don't need you (No help)
I put the food on the table, nigga was hungry, I tried to feed you
Treat all my niggas like bosses, nobody better, everyone equal (Yeah)
Real talk this the sequel, hold it down for my people

[Chorus]
I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill
We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense
He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in
Lil homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end
I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill
We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense
He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in
Lil homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end
