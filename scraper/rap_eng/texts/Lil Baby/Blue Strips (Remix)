[Intro: Yung Dred]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Count up a whole lot of (yeah)
I got a whole lot of (yeah)
I count a whole lotof (yeah)
Chaz Guapo

[Chorus: Yung Dred]
Count up a whole lot of blue strips
New money, who this?
So many racks on a nigga
I don't know what to do with it
So many packs on nigga
Swearin' sometimes I get paranoid
Lifestyle that you can't afford
Since a jit, I always wanted more

[Verse 1: Yung Dred]
Hopped off the porch on a money mission
In these streets I go tunnel vision
They ain't think I'll make it this far
Remember days me and Tish talked
69-12 gave mama hell
Posted on the curb tryna catch a sale
Me and you can't relate, 'cause me and you not the same
I took an O, I put it all on the line and threw the letters in the chain
Any weaker, got the gang with me, gray flags, count up big bags
I gave my hood motivation, and took it all across the nation
They ask me who I think I am, first of all, I'm the man
Double G on the slippers, Balmain with the zippers
Never get tired of ballin', told all my niggas we all in
Making money while she calling, choose the money over bitches
'Cause once you got it, she gon' want you with it
Got rich, did it independent

[Chorus: Yung Dred]
Count up a whole lot of blue strips
New money, who this?
So many racks on a nigga
I don't know what to do with it
So many packs on nigga
Swearin' sometimes I get paranoid
Lifestyle that you can't afford
Since a jit, I always wanted more

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Since a jit I wanted more so I went and got it
Only made deposits, no withdrawals, I'm all about my profit
Bad bitches watchin', got 'em jockin', tryna get all in my business
I done hit her, I went missing, now she all inside her feelings
Pinky ring bling hard, I ain't no one hit wonder, I'm hard
We was runnin' up in them cars
If we want it, you got it, we rob
Niggas do anything for attention
I consider them niggas bitches
Hope no rap guy don't diss me
I'ma make your mama cry, she gon' miss you
I'm a real street nigga, I'm official
Brand new vertical, ain't anorexic
Whole lot of blue strips, I'm on some new shit
Boy this that new drip
We go on private planes for a month straight
Took your baby mama on a lunch, great
I done ran it up, now I'm super straight, yeah

[Chorus: Yung Dred]
Count up a whole lot of blue strips
New money, who this?
So many racks on a nigga
I don't know what to do with it
So many packs on nigga
Swearin' sometimes I get paranoid
Lifestyle that you can't afford
Since a jit, I always wanted more
Count up a whole lot of blue strips
New money, who this?
So many racks on a nigga
I don't know what to do with it
So many packs on nigga
Swearin' sometimes I get paranoid
Lifestyle that you can't afford
Since a jit, I always wanted more
