[Intro: Young Scooter]
Yeah
Yeah Lil Baby
You a real street nigga
You really can't trust these niggas man
Yeah I got 4 Pockets Full too, nigga

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
These niggas ain't real, I don't trust them
All these plugs ain't one hundred, I don't trust them
I got love for my bitch but I don't trust them
All these lawyers play games, I don't trust them
Don't ever put your trust in a fake nigga
Don't ever put your trust in a fake bitch
So it ain't 'bout that money, it's irrelevant
4 Pockets Full, me and Lil Baby filthy rich

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Me and Black Amigo Scooter on the backstreets servin'
I ain't never had a job but I'm always working
I just sold a thousand pounds, man my week went perfect
I can't trust you pussy niggas 'cause I know y'all lurking
My lawyers sold me out so I can't trust them
My nigga Long kept it solid, gotta trust him
Paper, paper, paper, that's the only option
That money on me nigga, ask your bitch I got it
Hundred thousand all hundreds stuffed in all my pockets
I ain't got no fuckin' license, I don't plan on stopping
Got the gang in this bitch, who the fuck gon' stop me?
I'm the topic of discussion, all these bitches talkin'

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
These niggas ain't real, I don't trust them
All these plugs ain't one hundred, I don't trust them
I got love for my bitch but I don't trust them
All these lawyers play games, I don't trust them
Don't ever put your trust in a fake nigga
Don't ever put your trust in a fake bitch
So it ain't 'bout that money, it's irrelevant
4 Pockets Full, me and Lil Baby filthy rich

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Me and Lil Baby cocaine crazy
Jugg king, an 80's baby
4 Pockets Full with dead presidents, that's on the daily
We don't trust these lawyers, they tried to play me
I don't trust these plugs, they snitchin' daily
A nigga text my phone 'bout some bricks, boy you talkin' crazy
Young Scooter, I'm a trap scholar, just like Teezy Dollar
You a broke boy with no hustle, waitin' on your partner
I'm the boss man of my hood but I ain't the only boss
Real street nigga, I always watch out for the triple cross
You got caught with ten bricks and you snitched then that's a double loss
We remixed the weed and sent it back like we couldn't get it off
You shouldn't trust your jeweler nigga, take that fake ass jewelry off
A hundred mil in five years nigga, watch how I pull it off
Scooter!

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
These niggas ain't real, I don't trust them
All these plugs ain't one hundred, I don't trust them
I got love for my bitch but I don't trust them
All these lawyers play games, I don't trust them
Don't ever put your trust in a fake nigga
Don't ever put your trust in a fake bitch
So it ain't 'bout that money, it's irrelevant
4 Pockets Full, me and Lil Baby filthy rich
