[Chorus: Bite Da Don]
I'm the same nigga from the front street
Still juggin' out a ho's spot
Stayed down now I came up
And I was fucked up, I used the door lock
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part
Same nigga from the front street
Still juggin' out a ho's spot
Stayed down now I came up
And I was fucked up, I used the door lock
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part

[Verse 1: Bite Da Don]
I keep paper like a trashbag
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We be all in the trenches with it
Bombs all like Baghdad
Cameras all in the rear with it
I can see the streets when I back back
Plain jane, Gucci wrist watch
Got plenty sense but get dumb guap
Still drippin' at your ho spot
We was kickin' shit then we told part
Same nigga went to Buckhead and Court County just to dole off
Straight eight, that's a transformer
Me and Rudy hopin' out robots
Raf shirt, Gucci jugs on, Balenciaga, they low top

[Chorus: Bite Da Don]
I'm the same nigga from the front street
Still juggin' out a ho's spot
Stayed down now I came up
And I was fucked up, I used the door lock
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part
Same nigga from the front street
Still juggin' out a ho's spot
Stayed down now I came up
And I was fucked up, I used the door lock
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part

[Verse 2: Marlo]
I'm the same nigga on the backstreets with a big pistol and a hundred P's
Traphouse with a real plug, he done served over a hundred keys
Birds eye from the condo, motherfucker in the sky with it
Fishbowl on the new Benz, juggin' while my Cartier's tinted
Audemar my wristwear, iced in like a Frigidare
Chopsticks at Benihana, we ain't usin' no silverware
Watch me like a telescope, I really came up from selling dope
I'm on MLK with a yellow bitch, had to get some bags from the yellow store

[Chorus: Bite Da Don]
I'm the same nigga from the front street
Still juggin' out a ho's spot
Stayed down now I came up
And I was fucked up, I used the door lock
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part
Same nigga from the front street
Still juggin' out a ho's spot
Stayed down now I came up
And I was fucked up, I used the door lock
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I'm the same nigga from the front street with a big bomb on my nuts nigga
I'm the same nigga that stayed down, I ran that shit up nigga
You gon' clutch nigga, I done bust niggas
My bitch my dog, I don't trust niggas
Where I come from it was rough nigga
Tryna get it off in a rush nigga
If they ever grab you just hush nigga
I'ma have the lawyer pullin' up for you
Six figures for a Johnny [?]
I ain't comin' nothing less for you
Big AMG, look at me, did this shit on my own
I'm the same nigga from the west end with them country boys in my phone

[Chorus: Bite Da Don]
I'm the same nigga from the front street
Still juggin' out a ho's spot
Stayed down now I came up
And I was fucked up, I used the door lock
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part
Same nigga from the front street
Still juggin' out a ho's spot
Stayed down now I came up
And I was fucked up, I used the door lock
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part
Racks on me, nigga hashtag
We don't kick the shit 'cause we told part
