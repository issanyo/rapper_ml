[Intro]
Run that back Turbo

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Lotta blue hunnids they came from the bank
I drank this shit by the pint
If we leave then we fucking tonight
Jeans expensive they fitting me tight
I can't do this the rest of my life
Free the bros down the road doing life
Trying to sleep every night with a knife
Know it's hard but you gotta survive
Man they got twenty deep on the flight
Going wherever we like
You can go with us too if you like
I'm on top and I'm hot it feel nice
Fuck with snakes cause you niggas be mice
Diamonds hitting who cut off the lights
In the clouds we balling like Mike

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Soon as I get my money I'm gon blow it
Fuck that, I'ma take mine and put it up
I got some foreign baddies in my DM they hitting me up
They trying to get on the plane today and come eat me up
She had the fyest brain that I ever had
I gave her everything that I never had
I'm going next level on some more shit
These niggas dead broke on some hoe shit
Running that money up til I get tired
He said I wouldn't make it he lied
The codeine be all in my eyes
I'm doing that shit for the guys
She looked at my side like 'Who is that guy?'
That's my lil brother G5
They call him Steven, I call him Curry
That nigga shoot out your eye

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Lotta blue hunnids they came from the bank
I drank this shit by the pint
If we leave then we fucking tonight
Jeans expensive they fitting me tight
I can't do this the rest of my life
Free the bros down the road doing life
Trying to sleep every night with a knife
Know it's hard but you gotta survive
Man they got twenty deep on the flight
Going wherever we like
You can go with us too if you like
I'm on top and I'm hot it feel nice
Fuck with snakes cause you niggas be mice
Diamonds hitting who cut off the lights
In the clouds we balling like Mike

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
Residue on me I'm fresh out the trap (bando)
I gotta dust off my lap
I keep the ratchet like baps
Hundred round shots in the scrap
I'm on their face like a slap
You think you know me you jap (lingo)
I hit your bitch you was wide open
I'm in her stomach like cramps
(Yeah, what'd you do? How'd you do it?)
Soon as I got my money I ran through it
(I fucked up some commas)
I couldn't believe I saved some, I thought I blew it
(I thought it was all gone)
I just downed a whole pint, I'm under the influence
Then I popped an Adderall to give me endurance
I'm up I cannot get tired, your bitch on molly she wired
Tossed her with Moneybagg Myers
Plenty chains, clang clang, 50k plain Jane
Go get some money quit saying you can't
They thought I was born in the vault of the bank

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Lotta blue hunnids they came from the bank
I drank this shit by the pint
If we leave then we fucking tonight
Jeans expensive they fitting me tight
I can't do this the rest of my life
Free the bros down the road doing life
Trying to sleep every night with a knife
Know it's hard but you gotta survive
Man they got twenty deep on the flight
Going wherever we like
You can go with us too if you like
I'm on top and I'm hot it feel nice
Fuck with snakes cause you niggas be mice
Diamonds hitting who cut off the lights
In the clouds we balling like Mike
