[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay
Four Pockets Full yeah, Four Pockets Full yeah
Four Pockets Full yeah, Four Pockets Full yeah

[Chorus]
Faded, I'm on that sizzurp
Then I'ma light my spliff up
I'm a big dog, y'all niggas teacups
On the jet gettin' brain with my feet up
I don't bite my tongue, I'ma speak up
Send a hit, watch them young niggas eat up
No deer but a nigga got big bucks
Stayed down on my grind and I came up

[Verse 1]
Bitch I don't milly rock, I get the money
I got two bitches with me tryna jump me
Remember them old heads wouldn't front me
I'm shittin' on 'em, got 'em holdin' they stomach
That paper on me, gettin' it in by the bundle
The things they dream about a nigga done done it
Them bitches was stiff on the kid, they was frontin'
Now I'm stickin' dick all in they stomach
Drip season nigga, shout out to Gunna
No pussy in me but they know how I'm comin'
Drop a bag and he'll be dead in the morning
Headshots, I ain't sending no warnings
We don't shoot at houses, we hit a target
They  know I'm throwed off, they see I'm a target
No back and forth, we ain't doin' no walkin'
I stand on my words, I ain't doin' no barkin'

[Chorus]
Faded, I'm on that sizzurp
Then I'ma light my spliff up
I'm a big dog, y'all niggas teacups
On the jet gettin' brain with my feet up
I don't bite my tongue, I'ma speak up
Send a hit, watch them young niggas eat up
No deer but a nigga got big bucks
Stayed down on my grind and I came up

[Verse 2]
Came up on them niggas, didn't it
Hundred racks on me, I'ma spend it
This ain't Lacoste, nigga this Givenchy
Thousand pounds, me and Ced split it
Free Lil Steve, screamin' fuck the system
Dog I ain't know that was your sister
If I knew I still woulda hit her
Goin' crazy on them niggas, woah
Got the streets in a figure four
Your baby mama got a deep throat
I ain't kiddin', I don't tell jokes
Who want beef, I want all the smoke
I'm ballin' on these niggas, check the score
Flexin' on the Gram with your bro
Your bitch told me everything I know
Diss me nigga, you gon' get exposed

[Chorus]
Faded, I'm on that sizzurp
Then I'ma light my spliff up
I'm a big dog, y'all niggas teacups
On the jet gettin' brain with my feet up
I don't bite my tongue, I'ma speak up
Send a hit, watch them young niggas eat up
No deer but a nigga got big bucks
Stayed down on my grind and I came up

[Outro]
Came up, came up on them niggas
I got digits, I got commas, I got figures
We got sticks, we got choppers, we got MACs
We ain't goin' for that
