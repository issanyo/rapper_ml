[Chorus]
Fifty-five hunnit for a new pair of titties, I'll buy 'em like Jordans
Give her a couple of thousand, now she feelin' important
Dick her down, she'll be gone by the morning
She got them ass shots that I like
Pop a Addy, we'll be fuckin' all night
She say she got a man but it's alright, shoot outta town, first class flight
Fifty-five hunnit for a new pair of titties, I'll buy 'em like Jordans
Give her a couple of thousand, now she feelin' important
Dick her down, she'll be gone by the morning
She got them ass shots that I like
Pop a Addy, we'll be fuckin' all night
She say she got a man but it's alright, shoot outta town, first class flight

[Verse 1]
You can be mine and I can be yours
Let's have a baby and name it Dior
Ain't got no time I'm always on tour
I pressed decline I always ignore
I had to tease her so she can want more
Baby we grown we can fuck on the floor
Condo top floor, we gon' make love on the balcony
She want that dick tryna tackle me
I'm gettin' money like I was a athlete
Wake her up and put her back to sleep
I let the homie hit after me
She got super head he enjoying that
I ain't cuffing no bitch I ain't doing that
Once I hit it one time I ain't goin' back
I'm out the door like a floor mat
She say she diggin' my format
I'm the baby I'm a rug rat
She like, "Damn baby where my hug at?" I'm like, "Damn, baby, we don't do that"
Gave her a couple of thousand for the pussy
Get in there let her know I ain't no rookie
Put on a show like somebody else lookin'
Diggin in her deep make her push me

[Chorus]
Fifty-five hunnit for a new pair of titties, I'll buy 'em like Jordans
Give her a couple of thousand, now she feelin' important
Dick her down, she'll be gone by the morning
She got them ass shots that I like
Pop a Addy, we'll be fuckin' all night
She say she got a man but it's alright, shoot outta town, first class flight
Fifty-five hunnit for a new pair of titties, I'll buy 'em like Jordans
Give her a couple of thousand, now she feelin' important
Dick her down, she'll be gone by the morning
She got them ass shots that I like
Pop a Addy, we'll be fuckin' all night
She say she got a man but it's alright, shoot outta town, first class flight

[Verse 2]
She say she tied up, she got a man and he on her ass
She say she tired of 'em
Give her a perkie, a pack of backwoods and tell her to fire up
Top floor penthouse suit, baby, we high up
Who said that you cannot buy love?
We gon' be making love until the morning, baby, I'm tellin' you, this is your warning
I'm not gon' stop it, I'ma keep on flowin'
Adderall got a nigga goin'
I'ma get it cracking and you know it
I'ma make you happy, I ain't boring
You can tell your friends you don't know me
I'ma beat it up like you owe me
I gotta go, sorry you can't hold me
Fishtail the Vette like it's stolen
Baby you was lucky that I choose you
Fuck all that talkin', baby, I'ma show you
Put a lot of lean in my soda
Coffee cup but this ain't folger's
I know I be drippin' from my toe up
Just don't tell 'em nothing that I told you

[Chorus]
Fifty-five hunnit for a new pair of titties, I'll buy 'em like Jordans
Give her a couple of thousand, now she feelin' important
Dick her down, she'll be gone by the morning
She got them ass shots that I like
Pop a Addy, we'll be fuckin' all night
She say she got a man but it's alright, shoot outta town, first class flight
Fifty-five hunnit for a new pair of titties, I'll buy 'em like Jordans
Give her a couple of thousand, now she feelin' important
Dick her down, she'll be gone by the morning
She got them ass shots that I like
Pop a Addy, we'll be fuckin' all night
She say she got a man but it's alright, shoot outta town, first class flight
