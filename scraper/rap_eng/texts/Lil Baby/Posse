[Intro: Euro Gotit]
Yeah
Rocktee 'bout to run it up
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah)

[Chorus: Euro Gotit]
I dropped a pill in my drank, I took a mil' out the bank
Then I jumped in a Wraith, I'm everything that you ain't
My posse, up in Versace, eat on hibachi, run like Huarache
Fly to Dubai, nigga too fly, head in the sky, I'm ready to die
I dropped a pill in my drank, I took a mil' out the bank
Jumped in a Wraith, I'm everything that you ain't
My posse, up in Versace, eat on hibachi, run like Huarache
Fly to Dubai, nigga too fly, head in the sky, I'm ready to die

[Verse 1: Euro Gotit]
My snake in her head, Medusa (My Versace)
Now pray my lil homie don't shoot 'em (Shoot 'em)
Teach that lil' baby, no tutor
Call that lil' ho just to boot up (Boot up, boot up)
I take some Perkies, now I'm on the moon
Finna fly back to Earth, I got some shit to prove
Mama tired of Atlanta, so it's time to move
I done hopped in the game and now they finna lose, yeah
I fell in love with that bitch 'cause that bitch was a booster
Won't consider yourself as my brother if you ain't no shooter
Ride with the stick, trees, service
Stranger with bricks, he workin'
Don't play like you rich, we lurkin'
We with the shits, we murk you (Yeah, yeah)
I done came so far from the bottom (Done came so far from the bottom)
Used to want every foreign whip, now I got 'em (Skrrt)
Name a nigga who'll stop him (Nobody)
I walk with gangsters who'll rob him (Woo)
I'm up math, pulled a nigga problem

[Chorus: Euro Gotit]
I dropped a pill in my drank, I took a mil' out the bank
Then I jumped in a Wraith, I'm everything that you ain't
My posse, up in Versace, eat on hibachi, run like Huarache
Fly to Dubai, nigga too fly, head in the sky, I'm ready to die
I dropped a pill in my drank, I took a mil' out the bank
Jumped in a Wraith, I'm everything that you ain't
My posse, up in Versace, eat on hibachi, run like Huarache
Fly to Dubai, nigga too fly, head in the sky, I'm ready to die

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Lately I been feelin' crazy and trippin', I gotta get off the X pills
Bad bitch with me, came through drippin', I don't give a damn how my ex feel
We don't believe him 'cause he cap
I been thinkin' 'bout lean, I might relapse
Made a movie last night, need a recap
She came in on her feet, on her knees now (Yeah)
I just been takin' it slow and my mama wan' move so I bought her a new crib
Niggas be hatin' on me 'cause I'm poppin', but fuck it, I got me a shoe deal
Still in the hood like a motor
If they get in my way, run 'em over
Got the neighbors complainin' 'bout odors
They just brought me a load and I sold it
I'm takin' off, I don't play no games
I had a Mustang, now the new Mulsanne
I done seen friends change, seen families change
But I never ever seen money change
I just stayed the same 'til the money came
Screamin' free the bros out the chain gang

[Chorus: Euro Gotit]
I dropped a pill in my drank, I took a mil' out the bank
Then I jumped in a Wraith, I'm everything that you ain't
My posse, up in Versace, eat on hibachi, run like Huarache
Fly to Dubai, nigga too fly, head in the sky, I'm ready to die
I dropped a pill in my drank, I took a mil' out the bank
Jumped in a Wraith, I'm everything that you ain't
My posse, up in Versace, eat on hibachi, run like Huarache
Fly to Dubai, nigga too fly, head in the sky, I'm ready to die

[Verse 3: Euro Gotit]
Double the R, Rover the car
One Perc' don't work, double the bar
Double the Wraith then double the stars
Poppin' them phoenix, bring her to Mars
Mama cried when I took the stand
Took an oath, had to be a man
Never cried and I never ran
Said my prayers when I'm in the van
I'm on tour and every nigga with me from the hood (Yeah yeah)
Fifty racks and ain't nothin' from a jugg
I just want to see my son live good, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Euro Gotit]
I dropped a pill in my drank, I took a mil' out the bank
Then I jumped in a Wraith, I'm everything that you ain't
My posse, up in Versace, eat on hibachi, run like Huarache
Fly to Dubai, nigga too fly, head in the sky, I'm ready to die
I dropped a pill in my drank, I took a mil' out the bank
Jumped in a Wraith, I'm everything that you ain't
My posse, up in Versace, eat on hibachi, run like Huarache
Fly to Dubai, nigga too fly, head in the sky, I'm ready to die
