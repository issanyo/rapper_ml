[Chorus: Lil Baby]
4 by 4 truck, pull up big as fuck
Ain't never had shit, now a nigga mad rich
I always thought I'd get a mil', I ain't never think about three or four
Now the money going up now (up now), up now (yeah)
I put diamonds on my teeth like I'm from uptown
Now she tryna come around and let me fuck now
I done gave 'em my all only to get let down
Only to get let down

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I got money in my account that I'll probably never spend
I gotta to win win, it's on my kids kids
I got a new Benz, worth three-hundred
But I had signed a deal, for some shit you won't believe
I got needs, family in need
Teach them do's and don't's
Show 'em right from wrong
Give 'em money every time they ask
Knowing that I got an extra for they ass
Know that I'll be there when they count
I don't write checks that bounce
I don't write checks at all
Cash on all my cars
I [?]
I don't give a damn who care
Niggas got M's everywhere
I'm just tryna stay on top
Confidence I'm never gon' flop
People having hate in they heart
I can hear it when they talk
Know they talk bad but nothing right
Never have this fame tear me down
They tryna make me something I'm not
They gon' never [?]
Kept it real with all my fans and now I'm large (Now I'm large)
Kept it real with all my niggas from the start, this ain't no new beginning
Thousand dollars on denim, we finally winning, I'm thanking God (Thanking God)
I got the squad with me
I got the squad with me

[Chorus: Lil Baby & ?]
4 by 4 truck, pull up big as fuck
Ain't never had shit, now a nigga mad rich
I always thought I'd get a mil', I ain't never think about three or four
Now the money going up now (up now), up now (yeah)
I put diamonds on my teeth like I'm from uptown (uptown)
Now she tryna come around and let me fuck now (fuck now)
I done gave 'em my all only to get let down (let down)
Only to get let down (let down)

[Verse 2: ?]
Way I'm running with that sack, might score a touchdown
And when I Come back with that pack, gon' buy a bustdown
For running quick

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
4 by 4 truck, pull up big as fuck
Ain't never had shit, now a nigga mad rich
I always thought I'd get a mil', I ain't never think about three or four
Now the money going up now (up now), up now (yeah)
I put diamonds on my teeth like I'm from uptown
Now she tryna come around and let me fuck now
I done gave 'em my all only to get let down
Only to get let down
