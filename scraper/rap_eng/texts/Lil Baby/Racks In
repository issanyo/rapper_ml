[Chorus]
Bought me a fishing rod so I can reel that bag in
I remember back when I ain't have shit
Plug on the way, he say them bags in
Still in the hood gettin' them racks in
Bought me a fishing rod so I can reel that bag in
I remember back when I ain't have shit
Plug on the way, he say them bags in
Still in the hood gettin' them racks in

[Verse 1]
I should sign to Slaughter Gang 'cause I'm a savage
Word on the street Lil Baby havin'
I done fucked a thousand bitches out in Magic
These niggas broke, they pockets flat, that shit embarrassing
I just copped a new coupe, yeah the fast one
These niggas happy 'cause they finally fucked my last bitch
But I'm the one that told you she was nasty
Me and money havin' sex, we should get married

[Chorus]
Bought me a fishing rod so I can reel that bag in
I remember back when I ain't have shit
Plug on the way, he say them bags in
Still in the hood gettin' them racks in
Bought me a fishing rod so I can reel that bag in
I remember back when I ain't have shit
Plug on the way, he say them bags in
Still in the hood gettin' them racks in

[Verse 2]
I been on my grind, that's why I'm loaded
I'm like Luda in his prime, I got them bows in
Condo at the top, I don't let hoes in
Medusa in the section, got them holes in it
I'ma take her down and let the bro hit it
Niggas talkin' crazy, that's that ho shit
All my hoes own shit, all your hoes rent
Drive so many foreign cars they thought it was rented

[Chorus]
Bought me a fishing rod so I can reel that bag in
I remember back when I ain't have shit
Plug on the way, he say them bags in
Still in the hood gettin' them racks in
Bought me a fishing rod so I can reel that bag in
I remember back when I ain't have shit
Plug on the way, he say them bags in
Still in the hood gettin' them racks in

[Interlude]
I just copped a new coupe, yeah the fast one
These niggas happy 'cause they finally fucked my last bitch
But I'm the one that told you she was nasty
Me and money havin' sex, we should get married

[Chorus]
Bought me a fishing rod so I can reel that bag in
I remember back when I ain't have shit
Plug on the way, he say them bags in
Still in the hood gettin' them racks in

[Outro]
I got them racks in, yeah
I got them racks in, yeah
I got them racks in, yeah
I got them packs in, yeah
I got them packs in, yeah
I got them racks in, yeah
I got them racks in, yeah
I got them packs in, yeah
