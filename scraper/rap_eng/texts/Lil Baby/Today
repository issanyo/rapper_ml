[Chorus]
Said she wanna hop on the ride today
But I'm on the block with the guys today
Young nigga, I wanna buy the Wraith
Flooded Patek tell you time of day
I'm on the block with the iron today
She suckin' the dick, put it all in her face
I hop in that Audi and catch me a play
Run it up, I might just buy me a safe
Said she wanna hop on the ride today
But I'm on the block with the guys today
Young nigga, I wanna buy the Wraith
Flooded Patek tell you time of day
I'm on the block with the iron today
She suckin' the dick, put it all in her face
I hop in that Audi and catch me a play
Run it up, I might just buy me a safe

[Verse 1]
See I was broke one before
And I ain't goin' back no more
I used to sleep up on the floor
Said we was the ones, man might kick in your door
Draw down, make 'em get on the floor
These niggas be pussy, y'all really be whores
I got two baby mamas goin' on tour
She even suck the bros up while they snore
Yeah, shit, but she wanna hop in my ride
Young nigga lookin' fly, backwoods got me high
Play with my niggas, you die, I love my niggas, gon' ride
No question, my niggas gon' slide, it's all bullshit in 'til I die

[Chorus]
Said she wanna hop on the ride today
But I'm on the block with the guys today
Young nigga, I wanna buy the Wraith
Flooded Patek tell you time of day
I'm on the block with the iron today
She suckin' the dick, put it all in her face
I hop in that Audi and catch me a play
Run it up, I might just buy me a safe
Said she wanna hop on the ride today
But I'm on the block with the guys today
Young nigga, I wanna buy the Wraith
Flooded Patek tell you time of day
I'm on the block with the iron today
She suckin' the dick, put it all in her face
I hop in that Audi and catch me a play
Run it up, I might just buy me a safe

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Baby, I ran out of room in the space so I bought me another one
I ain't talkin' 'bout the other one
Captain of the team, huddle up
I'ma send a blitz, we gon' murder somethin'
Promethazine got me dozin' off
Remember when I had a four of soft
Everybody claim they know me now
New K, I been waitin' to spray
Nigga play then he dyin' today
Hit the victim then pull off in the Wraith
If they get us, ain't got nothin' to say
You can come get you a hundred today
I really came fresh and need all of the cake
I gotta go to a show in LA
Y'all niggas playin', I'm gettin' paid

[Chorus]
Said she wanna hop on the ride today
But I'm on the block with the guys today
Young nigga, I wanna buy the Wraith
Flooded Patek tell you time of day
I'm on the block with the iron today
She suckin' the dick, put it all in her face
I hop in that Audi and catch me a play
Run it up, I might just buy me a safe
Said she wanna hop on the ride today
But I'm on the block with the guys today
Young nigga, I wanna buy the Wraith
Flooded Patek tell you time of day
I'm on the block with the iron today
She suckin' the dick, put it all in her face
I hop in that Audi and catch me a play
Run it up, I might just buy me a safe
