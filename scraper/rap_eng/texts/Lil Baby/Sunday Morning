[Intro]
Cook that shit up Quay
Yeah yeah

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Soon as push up
She gon get in my car, yeah (my car)
Only drink Actavis (Act)
I don't take bars (I don't take bars)
Bringing my stacks up
And I can fuck on stars (fuck on stars)
Whenever my mood change
I can go and switch your car (switch your car)
Diamonds on Blu-Ray
Came thru dripping like Sunday morning (Sunday morning)
I just been stacking patient
Miss your birthday probably buy me a foreign (buy me a foreign)
Still balling hard like Jordan (Jordan)
Walk in the bank with my 40 (my 40)
Everywhere I go they recording (recording)
Stay down now I'm important (yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse 1: B La B]
Whole lotta blue racks (racks)
Bitches know we having money (ooh)
Pull up they like hooray (hooray)
Foreign coup, Chanel, we stunting
Smoking all this gold as soon as fuck I wanna roll up (soon as fuck)
A couple birdies in their Bentleys (brrr) screaming fours up (fours up)
Ain't no jelly I do Margiela
Piss on you no R. Kelly
Eating like a beast up in these streets I got a large belly
I want all the cash and I got all of the swag yeah (yeah, yeah)
Niggas they be mad they think I'm doing some kind of magic (why)
Ice on, when I hit that scene and shit the lights off
I'm piped up flyer than a kite I'm on a flight though
Gotta pipe down if you get too loud I'll knock your lights out
Wanna fight now I got some guys and they go *blow blow*

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Soon as push up
She gon get in my car, yeah (my car)
Only drink Actavis (Act)
I don't take bars (I don't take bars)
Ran my stacks up
And I can fuck on stars (fuck on stars)
Whenever my mood change
I can go and switch your car (switch your car)
Diamonds on Blu-Ray
Came thru dripping like Sunday morning (Sunday morning)
I just been stacking patient
Miss your birthday probably buy me a foreign (buy me a foreign)
Still balling hard like Jordan (Jordan)
Walk in the bank with my 40 (my 40)
Everywhere I go they recording (recording)
Stay down now I'm important (yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Real street nigga I ain't fighting no
We don't do one on one (no)
Fuck you think we chances
Riding with all these guns
I ain't never played the flute
But I keep these mags and I got this drum yeah
Young nigga just finish high school
But he get a X pill he going dumb yeah
I see him watching tryna get the recipe
I'll be god damned if I let him get the best of me
Money on me no regular pedestrian
I put that dope in pots and make it specialty
I pay security ain't no touching me
Everything guaranteed when you fucking me
Everything overseas it's a luxury
She just mad because she ain't get no nut from me
It ain't no IM team we on that fuckery
Bitch I'm a meal ticket ain't no cooking me
Bitch you can't come with me it ain't no company
How you a boss and you don't own a company
Pussy good, ass fat that shit come for me
Wish a nigga would, I ain't no rapper b
I be in the hood where all them trappers be
Everywhere I go I'm keeping that strap with me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Soon as push up
She gon get in my car, yeah (my car)
Only drink Actavis (Act)
I don't take bars (I don't take bars)
Bringing my stacks up
And I can fuck on stars (fuck on stars)
Whenever my mood change
I can go and switch your car (switch your car)
