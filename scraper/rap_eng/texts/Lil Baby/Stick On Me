[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Rylo Rodriguez]
Everywhere I go the stick on me
I can't let a nigga pick on me
Lil nigga, but I'm big homie
I can't keep a nigga bitch off me
I've been hearing niggas slick talking
F&N make 'em back off me
Percocet got me moonwalking
Young nigga tryna stay focused
Niggas play we gon' lay 'em down
Hit his block gon' spray them rounds
Wyclef, it's a man down
Pour the lean, wash the Xans down
In the loft breaking down pounds
First night she from out of town
Blood diamonds straight out the ground
So many hundreds I done lost count

[Verse 1: Rylo Rodriguez]
Run it up on a daily
Bad bitches on me daily
My young nigga go brazy
Lil Baby go crazy
Banana clip on the Draco you know I'll never let 'em play me
Chains on me like Kunta Kinte, I'll never let 'em slave me
Young nigga watch who you serve these niggas 12 like Brady
Fuck a bitch like Bobby Brown, I'll take it back to the 80's
Rylo come from the 90's
Cashing out on these diamonds
We'll hold a nigga hostage
If he don't pay it's a homi
I had to struggle in the projects, you ain't seen the shit I seen
They say we promoting violence
Bodies dropping, murder scene
Could've went and bought Balenci', but I spent it on the teeth
Don't ask me do I got my glizzy, bitch you know that's my ID

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go the stick on me
I can't let a nigga pick on me
Lil nigga, but I'm big homie
I can't keep a nigga bitch off me
I've been hearing niggas slick talking
F&N make them back off me
Percocet got me moonwalking
Young nigga tryna stay focused
Niggas play we gon' lay 'em down
Hit your  block we gon' spray them rounds
Wyclef, it's a man down
Pour the lean, wash the Xans down
In the loft breaking down pounds
First night she from out of town
Blood diamonds straight out the ground
So many hundreds I done lost count

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
No my niggas never switch on me
Glock 40 with the dick on it
Hunnit round with the stick on it
Trigger finger got a itch on it
2-3 like a pair of J's
I can't settle for no minimum wage
We'll set this bitch up in flames
Hide ya nigga now don't fuckin' play
Interrogation I ain't say shit
I'll never write a statement
Poppin' shit I'ma stay lit
Wipe a nigga down for six bricks
Now we screaming out "Free Bricks"
All my niggas on that fuck shit
Made a mil' out of kitchen cabinet
Codeine I'm on lean addict
Diss me we gon' get atcha
Country boys we straight tax you
In Atlanta I'm a big factor
All these bitches tryna scream at me
AMG wit' the kit on it
Killtec with the switch on it
Middle finger to my opponent
Screaming out who the fuck want it?

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go the stick on me
I can't let a nigga pick on me
Lil nigga, but I'm big homie
I can't keep a nigga bitch off me
I've been hearing niggas slick talking
F&N make them back off me
Percocet got me moonwalking
Young nigga tryna stay focused
Niggas play we gon' lay 'em down
Hit his block gon' spray them rounds
Wyclef, it's a man down
Pour the lean, wash the Xans down
In the loft breaking down pounds
First night she from out of town
Blood diamonds straight out the ground
So many hundreds I done lost count
