[Intro: Lil Baby & Blacc Zacc]
It's that bag talk, it's that bag talk
Bag after bag, bag after bag
Bag after bag, we got bags after bags
Bag after bag, bag after bag
Bag after bag, we got bags after bags

[Chorus: Blacc Zacc]
I know what to do to get that bag
I fucked your bitch and then brought her a bag
Nigga I can get you whacked for a bag
Bag after bag, ayy, bag after bag, ayy
I know what to do to get that bag
I fucked your bitch and then brought her a bag
Nigga I can get you whacked for a bag
Bag after bag, ayy, bag after bag, ayy

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
B-A-G me, this that bag talk
She like why you walk like this 'cause this that bag walk
All my diamonds hittin' like a glass ball
And I hear you niggas poppin' but it's all talk
Fifty-five hundred on a CC bag
Get the money, put it up, they'll never see this cash
Got some dogs in Carolina, said they get 'em by the hundred
Told 'em meet me at the spot, just send a driver with the money
Niggas hatin' on me dog
But I'm blessed, I'm thanking god, I hit my knees dog
Call me Jordan, I got bags for twenty-three dog
Bougee glasses, I ain't never gon' see y'all
I just get that bag dog

[Chorus: Blacc Zacc]
I know what to do to get that bag
I fucked your bitch and then brought her a bag
Nigga I can get you whacked for a bag
Bag after bag, ayy, bag after bag, ayy
I know what to do to get that bag
I fucked your bitch and then brought her a bag
Nigga I can get you whacked for a bag
Bag after bag, ayy, bag after bag, ayy

[Verse 2: Blacc Zacc]
I just got some drip from YSL
I just left LA, I scored a bale
Swimming in that water, Michael Phelps
Got four pockets full like I just signed to 4PF, ayy
All my niggas bosses, not no runners
I be in the trenches with some gunners
200K in jewelry, I'm being humble
Put a bag up on her, he mad I fucked his baby mama, ayy
Got his feelings hurt and brought that lil bitch Birkin
I been sippin' syrup and I'm poppin' perkies
I be wrappin' bales, I just started rappin' verses
VVS's on me, I got this shit from servin'

[Chorus: Blacc Zacc]
I know what to do to get that bag
I fucked your bitch and then brought her a bag
Nigga I can get you whacked for a bag
Bag after bag, ayy, bag after bag, ayy
I know what to do to get that bag
I fucked your bitch and then brought her a bag
Nigga I can get you whacked for a bag
Bag after bag, ayy, bag after bag, ayy
