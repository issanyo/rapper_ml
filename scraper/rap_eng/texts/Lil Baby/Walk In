[Intro]
Cook that shit up Quay
Run that back Turbo

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I ain't dead, I ain't in jail, safe to say I beat the odds
I was walkin' in the rain, tryna make it to my car
I put ice on all my watches for the times when it was hard
My mama caught me with a pistol, whipped me with extension cord
Puttin' designer on my shoes, no more walkin'
Just be naked when I get there, I'ma walk in
We gon' get straight to the point, ain't no more talkin'
Give you everything I got, I'm goin' all in

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Tennis chain blingin' with a pendant, came from Icebox
I been gettin' faded, poppin' pills like a white boy
Super freak, lowkey, mind her business, just my type
Super high and super fly, I'm floatin' like a kite
Went from LA, then to Vegas, then Miami in one night
If they catch you out in traffic they gon' smoke you at the light
When it's pressure it's on sight
My word is bond, just get it done and then I pay the price
I'm livin' one hell of a life
Sometimes I don't sleep at night
I stay up and think about the shit that I been through
Woke up this morning and went and bought a Benz coupe
It's feelin' like I need a threesome baby bring your friend too

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I ain't dead, I ain't in jail, safe to say I beat the odds
I was walkin' in the rain, tryna make it to my car
I put ice on all my watches for the times when it was hard
My mama caught me with a pistol, whipped me with extension cord
Puttin' designer on my shoes, no more walkin'
Just be naked when I get there, I'ma walk in
We gon' get straight to the point, ain't no more talkin'
Give you everything I got, I'm goin' all in

[Verse 2: Rylo Rodriguez]
Cee died in the bricks, 12 hit him up with a stick
Too much drink, man had surgery but he still pourin' up grits
Can't believe Margo told on Duke, thank God it hit him with a split
2:30 at Thad house, pray the bitch gon' get hit
Eighth grade Booker T, Jimmy had ounces in the locker
Ninth way we go stole, I ain't tryna eat no pasta
But Tyrone got killed when he was tryna see more dollars
Strapped down in that stall, why the hell you took my partner?
Granny tried to throw my stash away so many times
Hot days in the 'jects, we were flyin'
Tyshun died in a wreck but Geico can't help the stress
Byron he keep payin' a junkie, and that junkie my uncle
He just tryna get a rock, we was just tryna hit the block

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I ain't dead, I ain't in jail, safe to say I beat the odds
I was walkin' in the rain, tryna make it to my car
I put ice on all my watches for the times when it was hard
My mama caught me with a pistol, whipped me with extension cord
Puttin' designer on my shoes, no more walkin'
Just be naked when I get there, I'ma walk in
We gon' get straight to the point, ain't no more talkin'
Give you everything I got, I'm goin' all in
