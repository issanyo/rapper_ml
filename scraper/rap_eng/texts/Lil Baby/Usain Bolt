[Intro: Lil Baby]
Down bad, bitch blacked out, look like Kash Doll
I got racks dog, money in the back dog
I ain't goin' back dog, used to sleepin' on the mat dog

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I never ran from the shooters, I'm only chasin' the money, nonstop
I never ran from the shooters,I'm only chasin' the money, nonstop
I never run with the shooters, I'm headed straight to the money, nonstop
And I be hangin' with shooters, I'm runnin' straight to the money, nonstop
Like I'm runnin' four flats for these racks dog
I love runnin' four flats for these racks dog
I can run a four flat for these racks dog
Usain Bolt, Usain Bolt

[Verse 1: David Pablo]
Ready set go, pssh, I'm out of here
Relay in these packs, I'm tryna stack it half a mil this year
Baby mama called, said need some help, I put her daycare
Missing paper, thought the time would make her miss so she don't care
Wolf ticket selling ass niggas only shootin' flairs
Twin Glock, Jordan Anniversary, them bitch came in pairs
Corner fares frequently got me high up in the air
Keep it on me, hate havin' to find it when I get there

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Bentley Mulsanne, blew out the brain
Got so much game I could never be a lame
Keep two feet on my surfboard, I ride my own wave
Nigga sippin' like Lil Wayne, throw a dub in the Flame
Got a bad thick brown skin bitch, look like Kash Doll
My new lil bitch fuck me way better than my last broad
I got all these different type of women in my call log
These suckers out of date, these niggas still livin' in last fall

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I never ran from the shooters, I'm only chasin' the money, nonstop
I never ran from the shooters, I'm only chasin' the money, nonstop
I never run with the shooters, I'm headed straight to the money, nonstop
And I be hangin' with shooters, I'm runnin' straight to the money, nonstop
Like I'm runnin' four flats for these racks dog
I love runnin' four flats for these racks dog
I can run a four flat for these racks dog
Usain Bolt, Usain Bolt

[Verse 3: Kash Doll]
Soon as I got that green light I was gone
Paper chasing state to state but never forgot home
Pass the baton, you know that I'm gon' run it
Only thing I speak is money, write my raps in my blue hundreds, yeah
Get you a pretty brown bitch and call her Kash Doll
You can afford a bad bitch, you got the bag now
I'm never goin' back to broke, you niggas heard me?
Runnin' to that money like I'm Jackie, wanna curse me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Nonstop
Like I'm runnin' four flats for these racks dog
I love runnin' four flats for these racks dog
I can run a four flat for these racks dog
Usain Bolt, Usain Bolt

[Verse 4: Trap Frost]
It's a paper chase, runnin' to the bank
Keep a stankin' AK that could Dre you
Pop you, shock you, like a taser
Shooters movin' like the Navy
Uzi take out all your little friends
Bitch nigga, so don't play me, play me
I just pulled up on Lil Baby, hmm
Sippin' in my designer, hmm
Drip down my attire, hmm
All my bitches trafficking, hmm
No safety on that Glock
On Pablo, ain't no need to cock it
My draco don't want to be bothered
My draco don't want to be bothered

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I never ran from the shooters, I'm only chasin' the money, nonstop
I never ran from the shooters, I'm only chasin' the money, nonstop
I never run with the shooters, I'm headed straight to the money, nonstop
And I be hangin' with shooters, I'm runnin' straight to the money, nonstop
Down bad, bitch blacked out, look like Kash Doll
I got racks dog, money in the back dog
I ain't goin' back dog, used to sleepin' on the mat dog
I never ran from the shooters, I'm only chasin' the money, nonstop
I never ran from the shooters, I'm only chasin' the money, nonstop
I never run with the shooters, I'm headed straight to the money, nonstop
And I be hangin' with shooters, I'm runnin' straight to the money, nonstop
Like I'm runnin' four flats for these racks dog
I love runnin' four flats for these racks dog
I can run a four flat for these racks dog
Usain Bolt, Usain Bolt
