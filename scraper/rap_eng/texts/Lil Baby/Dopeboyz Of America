[Intro: Lil Baby]
Dope boys of America
Dope boys of America
Y'all know what the fuck goin' on bro
You dig

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I put my time in this shit, had to grind for this shit
Now I'm finally where I'm at, it ain't no more lookin' back
I've seen some shit I never thought I'd see
Gotta be all I can be, my folks dependent on me
We them dope boys of America
We them dope boys of America
We the ones serving in the area
Probably made a million dollars off the cellular

[Verse 1: Lil Baby & DopeboyRa]
Thirteen on the block, had to run me up some guap
I don't never stop for cops, turn some soft into a rock
Keep on whippin' 'til it lock, they goin' for thirty-six a pop
It'll make your jaw lock, I'm just tryna take off
Thank god them locks off me
I was sittin' in the state penitentiary
Niggas gon' be bitches, they don't get to me
I won't give you nothing, won't get shit from me
You ain't get shit from me then trap with me
Can't pay the fee, can't rap with me
Rich nigga slap dap with me
Young nigga gon' clap for me
Me and Lil Baby
Give they ass the business every time they see
Man we drive the young hoes crazy
Sixty-thousand dollars on a flooded Patek

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I put my time in this shit, had to grind for this shit
Now I'm finally where I'm at, it ain't no more lookin' back
I've seen some shit I never thought I'd see
Gotta be all I can be, my folks dependent on me
We them dope boys of America
We them dope boys of America
We the ones serving in the area
Probably made a million dollars off the cellular

[Verse 2: DopeboyRa]
You doin' cases daily basis
Unfamilar ass faces, unfamilar ass calls
Put your ass behind bars
Put this ice over these scars
So I aim for Louboutin money
They find that shit up in your car
Hope you got some bond money
Shit get hot, I hope you pull up in some on the run money
Son keep a drum tucked up in these long johns on me
From the cocaine eighties, Four Pockets Full like Baby
Drive them drinks at Uncle Bobby the greatest
We went from trappin' in these buildings now we vacuum seal it
Partner in the halfway house, I got some cash to give him
Slow roll, took a minute but I outlasted niggas
Pulled up with shawty, he ain't shot me
I shot past them niggas man

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I put my time in this shit, had to grind for this shit
Now I'm finally where I'm at, it ain't no more lookin' back
I've seen some shit I never thought I'd see
Gotta be all I can be, my folks dependent on me
We them dope boys of America
We them dope boys of America
We the ones serving in the area
Probably made a million dollars off the cellular
