[Intro: Moneybagg Yo]
Damn, shit really like a gift and a curse like
I go through a lot of shit but I can't forget nothin'
Even when I want to, it still fuck with me

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I went to jail my mama cried, it still fuck with a nigga, yeah
I really witnessed a homicide, it still fuck with a nigga, yeah
Got the phone call, my nigga died, it still fuck with a nigga, yeah
I really struggled before the shine, it still fuck with a nigga, yeah
Why would you come to me with all that fuckery knowin' you don't fuck with me? (know you don't fuck with me)
My dawg switched up, see he might not know it, but it still fuck with me (ooh it still fuck with me)
I'm havin' thoughts of the projects (the bottom)
While I'm livin' luxury (while I'm livin' good), yeah
She the main reason my heart cold (2 Heartless)
It still fuck with me (yeah), yeah (yeah)

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
I really struggled before the shine, it still fuck with me sometimes
'Member them days slept in the dark, I used to pray for some sunshine
Money hungry about every dollar, ready to eat like the lunchline
Signed my name on the dotted line (CMG), told my whole team that it's crunch time (BGE, oh Bread Gang)
Lost his life to the streets, it was tragic
Had the kid and cappin' right where it happened
Rushed home just for his nigga funeral
Next thing you know he the one in the casket
Lost my nigga, that shit there made me heartless (heartless)
All this pain got me drained, I'm black hearted
Now I'm smokin' blunt after blunt, two losses in six months
I ask him is he straight, he say he good
I can see it on his face it's fuckin' with him
She left me hangin' when I got jammed, fightin' them charges
That shit still fuck with me, I'm livin' luxury, started on carpet

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I went to jail my mama cried, it still fuck with a nigga, yeah
I really witnessed a homicide, it still fuck with a nigga, yeah
Got the phone call, my nigga died, it still fuck with a nigga, yeah
I really struggled before the shine, it still fuck with a nigga, yeah
Why would you come to me with all that fuckery knowin' you don't fuck with me? (know you don't fuck with me)
My dawg switched up, see he might not know it, but it still fuck with me (ooh it still fuck with me)
I'm havin' thoughts of the projects (the bottom)
While I'm livin' luxury (while I'm livin' good), yeah
She the main reason my heart cold (2 Heartless)
It still fuck with me (yeah), yeah (yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I lost my main man, that shit fuck with me
She say you don't love me, you just be fuckin' me
Shout out to bro, he the only one trusting me
Steve my nigga forever, he stuck with me
It done been hard, I starved before
I ain't goin' back broke no more
Kept it real, I ain't sell my soul
Got the bag and split it with my bros
'Cause I'm the realest nigga livin', you ask me
Made a hundred thousand, that was just last week
Niggas tellin' hoes how they gon' jam me
Draco make a nigga run like a track meet
Sometimes I feel like they just want trap me
Ain't have nothin', everybody seemed happy
Now I got the money, everybody changed
Kept it real and bought everybody chains
Damn my nigga, I can't surf on your wave
I knew I'd be great, I just had to find a way
Sometimes that shit fuck with me, I damn near cry
But I'm a man, I can't let no tear come out my eye

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I went to jail my mama cried, it still fuck with a nigga, yeah
I really witnessed a homicide, it still fuck with a nigga, yeah
Got the phone call, my nigga died, it still fuck with a nigga, yeah
I really struggled before the shine, it still fuck with a nigga, yeah
Why would you come to me with all that fuckery knowin' you don't fuck with me? (know you don't fuck with me)
My dawg switched up, see he might not know it, but it still fuck with me (ooh it still fuck with me)
I'm havin' thoughts of the projects (the bottom)
While I'm livin' luxury (while I'm livin' good), yeah
She the main reason my heart cold (2 Heartless)
It still fuck with me (yeah), yeah (yeah)
