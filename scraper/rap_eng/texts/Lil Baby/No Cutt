[Intro: Lil Baby]
Baby

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I like my dope clean, don't put no cut on it (no cut nigga)
Like my bitches bad with a butt on her (ass on her)
The car came with no miles, I'm the only owner (I just copped this)
I'ma have to zip him if he cut some corners (X him out)
Pockets full of blues, she got no choice but to choose (nope)
Saint Laurent my shoes, she say my demeanor rude (and?)
If I hit your wifey that's gon' cause a family feud (whoa)
I come out on top my nigga, I win, I can't lose (no sir)

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
Yup, crab and noodles, I'm eatin' crustaceans (paradise on my vacation)
My life real and I can't fake it (my life trill and I ain't do that)
Damn, my bitch bad but she act basic (my bitch bad but she act stupid)
We let off shots, you call a flagrant
Who got popped up, don't leave no statement
All I heard was he didn't make it (nope)
She got me to herself and leaked all your information (no way)
So I know what you goin' through, your bank account look vacant (empty)
That's like lookin' at a fat bitch when she get naked, ugh
Flexin' for the 'Gram, you ain't even got no paper to flex with
I ran up a check bitch, now they watchin' me like Netflix (look at me)
All my diamonds water, don't get fried, I tote fish sticks (big sticks)
Fully loaded SIG, when it spit it don't miss shit (mushy)

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I like my dope clean, don't put no cut on it (no cut nigga)
Like my bitches bad with a butt on her (ass on her)
The car came with no miles, I'm the only owner (I just copped this)
I'ma have to zip him if he cut some corners (X him out)
Pockets full of blues, she got no choice but to choose (nope)
Saint Laurent my shoes, she say my demeanor rude (and?)
If I hit your wifey that's gon' cause a family feud (whoa)
I come out on top my nigga, I win, I can't lose

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Hellcat, thousand horsepowers, got it geeked up
Heard your baby mama play with powder, get her geeked up
Heard that they want smoke but we too loud, they need to speak up
'Nother two hundred every weekend, they can't keep up
I was just sittin' in the prison with my phone out
Movin' like a boss, send a hit, get him dome called
Now I'm on the streets gettin' money, it's the same thing
Everywhere I go, don't matter the city, I let my chain hang
Post your life savings on your page, nigga you a dub
Magic City Monday, nigga trippin', probably threw a dub
Could've hit your bitch but I didn't nigga, you a scrub
I be sippin' red by the pint but I fuck with cuz

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I like my dope clean, don't put no cut on it (no cut nigga)
Like my bitches bad with a butt on her (ass on her)
The car came with no miles, I'm the only owner (I just copped this)
I'ma have to zip him if he cut some corners (X him out)
Pockets full of blues, she got no choice but to choose (nope)
Saint Laurent my shoes, she say my demeanor rude (and?)
If I hit your wifey that's gon' cause a family feud (whoa)
I come out on top my nigga, I win, I can't lose

[Outro: Moneybagg Yo]
BGE the logo, we got choppers like Sacario
They just caught you loafing at the Krogers, now you gotta go
FaceTime me like it's a match, don't hit me back
You play with the gang, your shit go splat, just got whacked
