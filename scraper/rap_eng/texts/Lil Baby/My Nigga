[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay

[Chorus: Marlo]
Black ski mask, we're ready to ride
For the money we get greedy when you floss
My family we gon' eat and we ain't starving
Gotta get your hands dirty when it's time to get it
My niggas down to ride and we all with it
Them my niggas, them my niggas
My niggas, them my niggas, them my niggas, them my niggas
Oh lord, them my niggas, them my niggas, them my niggas
I never go against that grain, 'cause them my niggas
My niggas, them my niggas, them my niggas, them my niggas

[Verse 1: Marlo]
Tweet my nigga, P my nigga, Baby my nigga, Say my nigga
I never go against my motherfuckin' dog niggas
And if they ever switch sides then they know I'ma fuckin' kill 'em
My nigga CJ died on me, man I miss my nigga Jizzle
Black ski mask when we hop out the black minivan
The folks screaming 12 but I don't give a fuck what they say
I never need my dogs when we goin' on them licks fam
We shoot it out with 12 in broad day about this shit fam

[Chorus: Marlo]
Black ski mask, we're ready to ride
For the money we get greedy when you floss
My family we gon' eat and we ain't starving
Gotta get your hands dirty when it's time to get it
My niggas down to ride and we all with it
Them my niggas, them my niggas
My niggas, them my niggas, them my niggas, them my niggas
Oh lord, them my niggas, them my niggas, them my niggas
I never go against that grain, 'cause them my niggas
My niggas, them my niggas, them my niggas, them my niggas

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
It's up there with my niggas, never go against the grain
Hold it down for the hood, and I put that on the gang
Niggas they was tellin' lies tryna tell the folks my name
I came inside the game, I went crazy, I'm insane
My niggas, them my niggas, I swear I love them
Won't call them niggas my niggas, them my brothers
My dawg for sure, we gave 'em two in a row
Never goin' back broke no more
I'm tryna make this work

[Chorus: Marlo]
Black ski mask, we're ready to ride
For the money we get greedy when you floss
My family we gon' eat and we ain't starving
Gotta get your hands dirty when it's time to get it
My niggas down to ride and we all with it
Them my niggas, them my niggas
My niggas, them my niggas, them my niggas, them my niggas
Oh lord, them my niggas, them my niggas, them my niggas
I never go against that grain, 'cause them my niggas
My niggas, them my niggas, them my niggas, them my niggas
