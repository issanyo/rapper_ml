[Chorus]
I don't go on dates, I can't wait, I fuck first day, yeah
I don't go on dates, I can't wait, I fuck first day, yeah
I don't go on dates, I can't wait, I fuck first day, yeah
I don't go on dates, I don't wait, I fuck first day, yeah
Flooded Pateek, flooded Patek, whatever you call it
My niggas ballin', my niggas ballin', my niggas ballin'
We gon' go to war with everybody, all my niggas shootin' headshots
We gon' go to war with everybody, all my niggas shootin' headshots

[Verse 1]
Young niggas really paved the way
Pussy nigga tryna ride the wave
Young nigga want a bankroll
Try me, I'ma break a nigga, woah
C Note with me, got a four-five
Nigga ain't lettin' shit slide
Tiger told me fuck it, let 'em ride
Told me fuck it, go and spin the block
I keep them blue hundreds like an ATM
You can't pull up in lil Cali, it ain't safe out here
Keep some shooters with me, they keep K's on them
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, tryna break the rim
Quarter million dollars on me
Ballin' on these niggas, Curry
Still screamin' fuck the police
Nigga ain't gettin' shit from me
DC in the cut with a MAC-10
Quan in the back with a Draco
All my niggas slidin' when I say so
All my niggas slidin' when I say so

[Chorus]
I don't go on dates, I can't wait, I fuck first day, yeah
I don't go on dates, I can't wait, I fuck first day, yeah
I don't go on dates, I can't wait, I fuck first day, yeah
I don't go on dates, I don't wait, I fuck first day, yeah
Flooded Pateek, flooded Patek, whatever you call it
My niggas ballin', my niggas ballin', my niggas ballin'
We gon' go to war with everybody, all my niggas shootin' headshots
We gon' go to war with everybody, all my niggas shootin' headshots

[Verse 2]
Look out for my people
Sellin' all this reefer
Servin' like it's legal
Pull up in the Regal
Went to school to fuck the teachers
Shooting shots from the bleachers
These niggas didn't believe me
I had to show 'em, made 'em see me
Pull up full pockets for a thigh pad
I got all these niggas big mad
Bitches tryna get some get back
Lil bitty bitch get back
Nigga's bitches riding pom poms
My lil niggas goin' straight dumb
I ain't Lil Weezy but a hot boy
I can't wait to smash on a cop car
These niggas sweet like poptarts
Drive the Hellcat like a hotbox
Party real hard, I'm a rockstar
Rudy in the cut, he a top shotter
If I send the word you a done dada
These niggas broke, got no dollars
I'ma run the money up, no problem
I don't give a fuck about nobody

[Chorus]
I don't go on dates, I can't wait, I fuck first day, yeah
I don't go on dates, I can't wait, I fuck first day, yeah
I don't go on dates, I can't wait, I fuck first day, yeah
I don't go on dates, I don't wait, I fuck first day, yeah
Flooded Pateek, flooded Patek, whatever you call it
My niggas ballin', my niggas ballin', my niggas ballin'
We gon' go to war with everybody, all my niggas shootin' headshots
We gon' go to war with everybody, all my niggas shootin' headshots
