[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay
Still poppin' Percocet
Drankin' lean too
Shit I gotta deal with

[Chorus]
Caught a few cases, I been on the road but overall a nigga still free
I done been robbed I know how it feel, a nigga gon' have to come kill me
I been through it all, I came this far how a nigga not gon' feel me
Ain't no facade, no cap in my raps everything that I say is the real me
I give all my problems to God
Let him handle all my enemies
I get on my knees and beg him please I just hoping that he hearin' me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get ahead of me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get the best of me

[Verse 1]
Remember that shoot out we had that time we thought a kid died
Only thing I know when we pulled up, everybody hopped out firin'
I remember on the way back, everybody in the car quiet
I'm just knowing everybody thinkin' we just pulled a homicide, homicide
See me on the news at the spot
Tryna see who they say got shot
I'm the first one stood up, told my brothers y'all all I got
Know if somebody seen us they gon' talk
Phone ringin' I thought it was a thottie
Thinkin' damn, "we just caught a body"
Hopin' everybody keep it solid
Fuck the nigga, I'm thinkin' bout the kid
The nigga shouldn't did what he did
I'm just glad a nigga still here for all the stupid shit that we did
Gotta be here for my kid, gotta watch my son get big
Everything I say is no lie, I'm just glad the kid didn't die

[Chorus]
Caught a few cases, I been on the road but overall a nigga still free
I done been robbed I know how it feel, a nigga gon' have to come kill me
I been through it all, I came this far how a nigga not gon' feel me
Ain't no facade, no cap in my raps everything that I say is the real me
I give all my problems to God
Let him handle all my enemies
I get on my knees and beg him please I just hoping that he hearin' me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get ahead of me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get the best of me

[Verse 2]
All I see is young niggas on Instagram with them sticks
I never post no gun, but when it's smoke I bet I send a blitz
That bullshit that you on thinkin' cool get you a 100 years
I bet yo partner fuck yo bitch, I bet you don't hear nothin' from the clique
I ain't gon' tell you no lie, this shit'll make a grown man cry
Folks give yo ass that time, you'll never see the outside
All you do is think and wonder why
Kiss the good life goodbye
Now you gotta fight to survive, ain't no guns all you got is knives
Hear a nigga sharpen 'em at night
Young niggas gone on the ice
Grown men fucking grown men they'll never tell you that part
Buy a phone you gotta have a spot
Everyday a nigga get knocked
Search team turn to the narcs, man this shit can really get hard

[Chorus]
Caught a few cases, I been on the road but overall a nigga still free
I done been robbed I know how it feel, a nigga gon' have to come kill me
I been through it all, I came this far how a nigga not gon' feel me
Ain't no facade, no cap in my raps everything that I say is the real me
I give all my problems to God
Let him handle all my enemies
I get on my knees and beg him please I just hoping that he hearin' me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get ahead of me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get the best of me
