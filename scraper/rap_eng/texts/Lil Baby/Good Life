[Intro]
Cook that shit up Quay

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Fuck the feds, I took a chance and went and got it right
Thousand pounds overnight on a private flight
Toasted up with all my bros, this the good life
Toasted up with all my bros, this the good life
You don't know 'bout the shootouts that we had
I was goin' in my bag
Damn near fucked up my sack, fell off then I bounced back
Now we paid now, getting money, now we paid now

[Verse 1: Eastside Jody]
Took a loss and I made it back
Took some powder and I made it crack
In the pot, the dope made it back
Driving here, she just made it back
Remember back when I ain't have a sack
Remember back, I couldn't get a pack
I'm on now, I front my niggas packs
The feds won't get up off my back
Fuck 'em, I'ma get up off this pack
My bitch love me, she got the biggest Rollie
I took a loss, she tried to sell her Rollie
Good life, nigga rich life
Plug life, nigga drug life
I always got the best drug price
This week I paid the plug twice
We ain't running out, we ain't stuntin' drought
The work in so we coming out
If the money calling I'ma be en route
Don't trust them niggas, I been having doubts (fuck 'em)
Don't trust them niggas, I been having doubts
My nigga down, I'ma help him out
Fuck them niggas, we can shoot it out

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Fuck the feds, I took a chance and went and got it right
Thousand pounds overnight on a private flight
Toasted up with all my bros, this the good life
Toasted up with all my bros, this the good life
You don't know 'bout the shootouts that we had
I was goin' in my bag
Damn near fucked up my sack, fell off then I bounced back
Now we paid now, getting money, now we paid now

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Listen, I done came such a long way
From selling crack in the hallway
Cut school, used to trap all day
We ain't turning back 'til we all paid
You deserve J's and a Volvo
Had work, same color carbo
Bust a nine down, we be riding 'round
Went from Tom Boulevard to Far Road
Remember ice and money on Campbellton
We met Too $hort when we was gambling
It's what's in me nigga, not what's on me
Anything I ever had I can get again, shit
Been a real one since I was real young, huh
Since a pre-teen wanted one thing
Get a deal done for some millions
It be plenty weather, no North Faces
A juvenile fighting court cases
Now I walk around so much money on me, like I won at the horse race
Get the pav√©s in the big P, Plain Jane on the wristpiece
In solitaire, flyin' private everywhere
Think it came easy, bitch please

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Fuck the feds, I took a chance and went and got it right
Thousand pounds overnight on a private flight
Toasted up with all my bros, this the good life
Toasted up with all my bros, this the good life
You don't know 'bout the shootouts that we had
I was goin' in my bag
Damn near fucked up my sack, fell off then I bounced back
Now we paid now, getting money, now we paid now
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I called Eastside Jody, asked him what's the word
He told me he working, got a couple verse
All my words slurred, I be on syrup
Put the city on my back, ain't have on no shirt
I took a chance with all I had, put it in a box
Fast forward six months, now I run a block
I used to stay with the J's eatin' cold food
Now I can fall asleep in a Wraith if I chose to
All them niggas nuts, I call them a loose screw
Better keep your strap, you slippin', they gon' do you
I refuse to be a victim, I can't make the news
I can't go back to no prison, I got shit to lose, I got shit to lose
