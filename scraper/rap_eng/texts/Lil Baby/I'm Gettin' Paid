[Intro: Lil Duke]
Yeah, first song of 2018, you dig?
Yeah, shout out my Alabama niggas
Mattazik been boomin' off rip

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
I'ma clean up like a maid, every day I'm gettin' paid
My bitch say I'm stuck in my ways, young nigga sharp as a blade
We was just thumbin' through cash
And runnin' through bags, young nigga gotta get paid
I can't be makin' no minimum wage
Used to be broke now we all on the stage

[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
I'm this bitch with The Game
Sixty whole racks for the chain
They're singing my shit all in Spain
Got off my ass and I made me a name
Young nigga runnin' with mobsters
We eatin' shrimp, steak, and lobster
And we don't fuck with imposters
I spend a rack on some joggers
I'm in LA like a Dodger
Bad bitches all on my roster
Sippin' on lean, need a doctor
I poured an eight in a bottle
Pull up and hop out, I'm proper
Christian Dior, no Prada
Top of the year, I'm 'bout to hop on a Lear
Bend that ass over, I fuck from the rear
Finna sleep in the air and I don't gotta steer
Broke with no money, you cannot get near
Sipping on lean, I'm not drinking no beer
I talk about hundreds, I don't want to hear
I'm tryna stack up a milly and grind
Been working so hard, I know it's my time
They do not want me to shine, I gotta keep me a nine
I can't be wasting my time, I gotta get it, I grind for what's mine
I can't be pouring up lines, I buy me a pint every time they come 'round
Keep it flat like I'm Santana, pour up a deuce in a Fanta
Ballin' on niggas with handles
Fresh as a bitch for the cameras

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
I'ma clean up like a maid, every day I'm gettin' paid
My bitch say I'm stuck in my ways, young nigga sharp as a blade
We was just thumbin' through cash
And runnin' through bags, young nigga gotta get paid
I can't be makin' no minimum wage
Used to be broke now we all on the stage

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Yeah, runnin' up the cars, them hood fights in the park
Hotboxin' it get dark nigga, can't post his picture, he done robbed nigga
I'm standing all on stage nigga, dub a show gettin' paid nigga
Do that shit like every day, that's a hundred forty every week
My trap house on peak, my lil homies gon' sleep
[?] 'partment on Spark Street, so you know we pulled up deep
Lil homie on the X pill, runnin' 'round on percocets and he geeked
And he keep draco on the sheet, he just want to rock a young nigga sleep
Paid for her to get an abortion, I made her treat me important
I been ridin' around in Porsches, I'm addicted to lean, I keep pourin' it
They didn't let me get in, now I'm going in
Get my money together, it's flowing in
Get my army together, we going in
I was good for this shit, I was sworn in
Free throw line, I'ma hit mine
Sit on recline, me and G5
On the top of the clouds, me and Fadey
On a private jet, nigga we made it
When the people see me they go crazy
Got these bankrolls on me, I ain't changing

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
I'ma clean up like a maid, every day I'm gettin' paid
My bitch say I'm stuck in my ways, young nigga sharp as a blade
We was just thumbin' through cash
And runnin' through bags, young nigga gotta get paid
I can't be makin' no minimum wage
Used to be broke now we all on the stage
