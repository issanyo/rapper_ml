[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Headshots, headshots, I want headshots
I got all these bags from my rasta
Draco on me like I'm top shotta
My Jamaican say it's power in his dreadlocks
Got a chopper with a knife and a red dot
If you bambaclaats play then you a don dada
Everything I want it, now my son got it
On a cruise ship, gettin' faded like Bob Marley
Doin' donuts in the slums in a new Ferrari
Got a bad bitch with me, she come from the islands
Told her she ain't gotta wear no makeup
Tonight we goin' to Jamaica
I want this love on me, she want to love on me
I keep my gun on me
I'm comin' from the streets, I'm from the streets

[Chorus: Skillis]
Salute the ghetto youths them whe street smart
From ya ready when beef start
All of my friend, dem a gangsta
Me na par with na man with no weak heart
Chargie dem street smart
Watch [?], we walk
Damn girl [?] a bus
A dem life, them a lost, real fast

Any way [?] give money, they not gon' get that

Straight forward, we not step up
Success, them no expect that
Rude with the strap, we no left that

Certain things you can't learn in a college
Real gangster graduate full of street knowledge
No weak fence, man solid

[Chorus: Skillis]
Salute the ghetto youths them whe street smart
From ya ready when beef start

Me na par with na man with no weak heart
Chargie dem street smart
Watch [?], we walk
Damn girl [?] a bus
A dem life, them a lost, real fast
