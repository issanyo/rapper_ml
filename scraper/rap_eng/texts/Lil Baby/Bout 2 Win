[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
'Bout to win on these niggas
I can't wait on no nigga
Ain't gon' play with no nigga
And it came with me nigga
I put the "I" and the "N" in "win"
I put the "MG" on the Benz
Sellin' raw in the trenches for real
Could've got a Bently Florida deal
We was hungry so I went and got a mill
I'm tryna tell my lil' nigga to chill
Sippin' water tryna stay out the seal
I want 5 karats each ear
Sendin' headshots to my enemies, the gon' die when it's time
Spendin' sixty on a necklace anywhere niggas stoppin' my shine
Whippin' the soda and water, I'm goin' harder, I make a 30 tomorrow
Puttin' it up for my son, a nigga shoot me, he better get some
I was down, bad, nigga had it, ain't even let me get none
Now I'm 'bout to win on these niggas, I don't let 'em get none

[Chorus: YG Teck]
I'm 'bout to win on you niggas, yeah

[Verse 2: YG Teck]
I keep a shooter with me that's with it
I got a bitch real as my niggas
We got one mission: let's get it
We got one mission, that's get it
I don't play the block no more, I'm bimpin'
I got a cell phone that's clippin'
I got some niggas gone and I miss 'em
I got some niggas gone and I miss 'em
Straight from the bottom, you know I ain't playin' with niggas, I know this my year
This how it look when you come from the bottom and put in that work and you know that it's near
I come from nothin'
Cut on the oven, put it on 500, and heat up the house
We gon' eat in this drought
I sell D in the drought
This world ain't never leavin' me out, no
I ain't got a Rollie watch, but I got the streets and they know I'm hot
And they know my block
Real nigga, independent, really worked my way to the top
I got a 30 on me right now
Young nigga lit, I love my life now
4 Pockets and No Excusez, I'm goin' up, I'll never pipe down
I had it harder than these niggas
I'm way harder than these niggas
We was sleepin' on floors for real
We was movin' with them [?] for real
Sellin' smack tryna get me a mill
From the bottom, boy, I know how it feel
From the bottom, boy, I know how it feel, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: YG Teck]
I'm 'bout to win on you niggas, yeah
I'm 'bout to win on you niggas, yeah
I'm 'bout to win on you niggas

I'm 'bout to win on you niggas
I'm 'bout to win on you niggas
I'm 'bout to win on you niggas, uh
I spent a band on you niggas, uh
I put like ten on a nigga, yeah
I'm 'bout to win on you niggas
I'm 'bout to win on you niggas
