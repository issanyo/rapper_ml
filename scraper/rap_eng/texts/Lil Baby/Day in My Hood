[Intro: Sherwood Marty]
Stuck in the trenches
(You know we gon win, we do not lose
We goin in, we break all the rules
Can't trust a friend, keep you a tool
If the police run in, then we make the news)
Sherwood Marty (skrrt skrrt)
That's a day in my hood
Damn I'm the fresh prince in my hood nigga
Long live Zorilla
Yeah, SOG

[Chorus: Sherwood Marty]
On my knees shootin' craps (that's a day in my hood)
Selling P's out the trap (that's a day in my hood)
We gon' be in the trap ('til we livin' good)
Tryna make it with this rap (and get out the hood)
You know we gon' win (yeah yeah)
We do not lose (when we in the hood)
We goin' in (yeah yeah)
We break all the rules (when we in the hood)
Can't trust a friend (no)
Keep you a tool (when you in the hood)
If the police run in (if the police run in)
Then we make the news (when we in the hood)

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I was in the hood shooting dice, probably lost my last dime
12 pulled me over last week, said this my last time
Dracos and them 40's stacked up, last night we was masked up
We goin' on the move, they say he got pounds
Well guess what, we takin' him down
Narcs in the hood tryna say I run a gang
Niggas I used to fuck with, telling hoes they gon' take my chain
Throwing dirt on my name
Strapped up at my shows, nigga I ain't no ho
I ain't backing down, I won't fold
Every nigga with me on go
They tryna tell me don't come to the hood, I'm thinking why not?
How the fuck I'ma stay away from the hood and this all I got
It's like you with me or not, nigga play with me get shot
Give it everything I got, all I needed was a shot

[Chorus: Sherwood Marty]
On my knees shootin' craps (that's a day in my hood)
Selling P's out the trap (that's a day in my hood)
We gon' be in the trap ('til we livin' good)
Tryna make it with this rap (and get out the hood)
You know we gon' win (yeah yeah)
We do not lose (when we in the hood)
We goin' in (yeah yeah)
We break all the rules (when we in the hood)
Can't trust a friend (no)
Keep you a tool (when you in the hood)
If the police run in (if the police run in)
Then we make the news (when we in the hood)

[Verse 2: Sherwood Marty]
I'm back to rapping and running up bands
Trapping and wrapping them packs
I'm the one put the whole hood on my back
I'm the one jumping out black with the MAC
I'm in the Range with Lil Z and we strapped
Four and Lil Flame counting racks in the back
You play and you know they gon' knock off your hat
Can't fuck with new niggas, I swear they gon' rat
I got the hustle
I'm the one locked down the game with the muscle
I'm moving pounds and I do it no struggle
We gon' get to it, I know we gon' bubble, yeah yeah
Them niggas hate, I let 'em hate
They can take shots to the face
I fuck with Lil Baby, that nigga go cray
Get to the bag nigga that's every day
Count up that cash, nigga that's every day, yeah
I count up that cash and put that in the safe, yeah
I got them plates and you know that we ate
What they gon' say when I go cop me a Wraith

[Chorus: Sherwood Marty]
On my knees shootin' craps (that's a day in my hood)
Selling P's out the trap (that's a day in my hood)
We gon' be in the trap ('til we livin' good)
Tryna make it with this rap (and get out the hood)
You know we gon' win (yeah yeah)
We do not lose (when we in the hood)
We goin' in (yeah yeah)
We break all the rules (when we in the hood)
Can't trust a friend (no)
Keep you a tool (when you in the hood)
If the police run in (if the police run in)
Then we make the news (when we in the hood)
