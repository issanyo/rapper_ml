[Intro: Dado & Lil Baby]
Dado
Baby
Seven Nine
4 Pockets
Yeah

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Straight out the projects
I came from nothing so I spent a lot on my watches
These bitches be jockin'
I got 'em watchin', I'm guessin' they feelin' my posture
Designered down for a year straight
Everything about me updated, yeah
Came up off sellin' that weight, yeah
Came up off sellin' that weight
Everybody with you gotta get it
Ridin' through the city, windows tinted
Found a plug and went and made a killing
Tryna stack it tall until the ceiling
Amiri jeans, knowin' Bally denim
The money good, tell him he can send 'em
Came up off sellin' that weight
I came up off sellin' that weight
Straight out the projects
I came from nothing so I spent a lot on my watches
These bitches be jockin'
I got 'em watchin', I'm guessin' they feelin' my posture
Designered down for a year straight
Everything about me updated, yeah
Came up off sellin' that weight, yeah
Came up off sellin' that weight
Everybody with you gotta get it
Ridin' through the city, windows tinted
Found a plug and went and made a killing
Tryna stack it tall until the ceiling
Amiri jeans, knowin' Bally denim
The money good, tell him he can send 'em
Came up off sellin' that weight
I came up off sellin' that weight

[Verse: Dado]
I came up off sellin' that weight
My whole team up, now we straight
I'ma keep ballin' with all of my niggas
Don't care if you pussy boys hate
Young nigga, I'm greater than Lakes
A nigga ain't takin' no breaks
The rulers better not get behind me
They do then I'm takin' they ass on a chase
I'm covered in designer, you know that I'm draped
Bitches surround us when we walk in the place
You can see I'm real, just look at my face
I been had a hundred racks stuffed in the safe
So if you ain't notice how a young nigga comin'
Been gettin' the big bales in by the bundle
Been gettin' racks in so I'ma keep thumbin'
I'ma do it for the days when I ain't had nothin'
My mama she proud of me now
They hatin', I smile at they frowns
They fakin', it always come out
I had to be patient but I am up now
I don't do no hating, I don't do no faking
I don't do relations, I only get paper
The fuck is you sayin', ain't shit on me basic
I do it for Tito so I'ma keep chasin'

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
