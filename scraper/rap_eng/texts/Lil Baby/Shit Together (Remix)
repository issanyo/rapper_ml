[Chorus: Jayway Sosa]
I bet with my lingo I can make a fortune
As good as money
Drop a couple racks and now she say she feel important
She know I'm stuntin'
Everything I live and breathe just wanna be successful, ayy
Wake up every morning, grab the sack from out the dresser
Them Franklins piling, yeah them Franklins piling
And my niggas still 'bout whatever
I can't think about it, chasin' nothin' but bodies
Now I'm re-ing up with extra
I'm so clever, I be fly forever, rock my jesus pieces like a medal
All these hoes ever really wanted was a nigga with his shit together
A nigga with his shit together

[Verse 1: Jayway Sosa]
Swear I can't take no more loses
Ran up my sack with a circle of bosses
Pray for my heart, I got ice on my cross
Big special what cost it
And I know how to get it out the mud
Even though they ain't never sold 'em
All I ever hear is rappers say they movin' drugs
Make you tighten up and guard your rep with your life if I told you what it really was
You ain't even met the plug
Chopper stashed in them traphouses, 'bout to duck out like I'm a fud
Beginning to finish, bitch said fuck your feelings
My pockets replenished, we came out the trenches
We wrestle them sacks, choke hoes on the business
Bitch seen water whip it, she wanna get in it, swerve
All them packs I gotta stretch
Wake up to a jugg and grab the batch from out the dress
What's really good, boy you broke and you look like you stressed
We chasin' the cash and my niggas still 'bout whatever
Better get your shit together

[Chorus: Jayway Sosa]
I bet with my lingo I can make a fortune
As good as money
Drop a couple racks and now she say she feel important
She know I'm stuntin'
Everything I live and breathe just wanna be successful, ayy
Wake up every morning, grab the sack from out the dresser
Them Franklins piling, yeah them Franklins piling
And my niggas still 'bout whatever
I can't think about it, chasin' nothin' but bodies
Now I'm re-ing up with extra
I'm so clever, I be fly forever, rock my jesus pieces like a medal
All these hoes ever really wanted was a nigga with his shit together
A nigga with his shit together

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Finally got my shit together, I just bought another bezel
I done reached another level, young kid from the ghetto
Going to Magic City, changing the weather
We gon' pull up and we shoot at whoever
I'm poppin' shit, poured a four in my beverage
Hard to stand on the stage with my habit
They used to talk nasty, they wouldn't pass me
Now they talk nasty, they wanna smash me
I didn't have no money, that shit was embarassing
Now I just went to the bank and I cashed in
I got the Z06 'Vette, it's the fast one
I'm keeping this money on me like I planted
I came through in a Maserati, you wasn't with me
I kept the windows clear, I ain't even tint it
I just came through in a brand new spaceship
Chopper give a nigga facelift
Niggas still on that hating shit
Free Tay-K, I did the race bitch
I keep Jayla with me, she gon' slay shit
If the feds come I won't say shit
Got some secrets I'ma hit the grave with
Made a million dollars so I'm hood rich

[Chorus: Jayway Sosa]
I bet with my lingo I can make a fortune
As good as money
Drop a couple racks and now she say she feel important
She know I'm stuntin'
Everything I live and breathe just wanna be successful, ayy
Wake up every morning, grab the sack from out the dresser
Them Franklins piling, yeah them Franklins piling
And my niggas still 'bout whatever
I can't think about it, chasin' nothin' but bodies
Now I'm re-ing up with extra
I'm so clever, I be fly forever, rock my jesus pieces like a medal
All these hoes ever really wanted was a nigga with his shit together
A nigga with his shit together
