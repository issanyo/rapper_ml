[Chorus]
The narcs just ran in the spot
Nobody was there, we got out
I know they mad as fuck
They can't keep tabs on us
We dodging the feds, tryna get this paper
He on the grind and I'll see you later
I'm tryna grind, go and get this paper
The narcs just ran in the spot
Nobody was there, we got out
I know they mad as fuck
They can't keep tabs on us
We dodging the feds, tryna get this paper
He on the grind and I'll see you later
I'm tryna grind, go and get this paper

[Verse 1]
I'm rockin' Balmains like they cheap
I brought out all hundreds and it's neat
I ride in foreign cars like I'm Meek
Punchin' on foreign broads on the beach
I got it all gone in a week (week)
Saved by the bell like I'm Screech (Screech)
F&N ride on my seat
Hope one of you niggas don't reach
I'm on that timeline, niggas watchin'
I just spent sixty thousand on some watches
I'm rockin' Tom Ford like a doctor
I just spent twenty thousand on some choppers
We keep them Dracos, shout out to the shottas
Nigga we gotta pull up in apartments
This shit was hard for us, we thought we all was stuck
They told me go get it and I went and got it
Lil nigga I'm the one that got it poppin'
Lil nigga pull up on ya, try to pop ya
I been hearin' niggas talkin'
But when I pull up on them niggas' head drop
I got the streets in a head lock
Straight to the money, no stops
Straight gas, nigga fuck cops

[Chorus]
The narcs just ran in the spot
Nobody was there, we got out
I know they mad as fuck
They can't keep tabs on us
We dodging the feds, tryna get this paper
He on the grind and I'll see you later
I'm tryna grind, go and get this paper
The narcs just ran in the spot
Nobody was there, we got out
I know they mad as fuck
They can't keep tabs on us
We dodging the feds, tryna get this paper
He on the grind and I'll see you later
I'm tryna grind, go and get this paper

[Verse 2]
Pussy nigga hatin', pocket watching(I see you watchin nigga)
Hope that they ain't forget the pocket rocket
Everything I do is expensive, old school dash digit
I been grindin' for a minute, I been really really gettin' it
We was really in them kitchens, I can show you how to get it
Turned a nickle to a fifty, turned a fifty to a dollar
Take the dollar to your partners, show 'em how to add the water
Lock it up and make it harder, Bentley ridin' with the mobsters
We don't eat pasta, we hit on oodles of noodles
We got the weight, that's a full one, damn she just blew me
Pass me the percs I need two of 'em
Get to the money, I'm racin'
Bitch better check my trap, I'm gettin' money
Pockets full, why not, FN on the side
Niggas try me they gon' die
Youngins screamin' what's the price? I can't wait to let 'em slide
It's gon' be a homicide
I ain't gotta tell no lies, 4PF until I die

[Chorus]
The narcs just ran in the spot
Nobody was there, we got out
I know they mad as fuck
They can't keep tabs on us
We dodging the feds, tryna get this paper
He on the grind and I'll see you later
I'm tryna grind, go and get this paper
The narcs just ran in the spot
Nobody was there, we got out
I know they mad as fuck
They can't keep tabs on us
We dodging the feds, tryna get this paper
He on the grind and I'll see you later
I'm tryna grind, go and get this paper
