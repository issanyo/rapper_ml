[Chorus: Jay5]
I got racks, I'm a king, that's for sure sure
Expensive guns, I keep a draco, ain't for show show
Shawty fit, she bounce on that dick like a pogo
Broke boys coppin' Rollies, I just bust the Hublot
I get racks, that's for sure sure
All these bitches fuckin', that's for sure sure
Oh you trappin', can't compete, my prices too low
She don't swallow, pull out, nut all on her kudo

[Verse 1: Jay5]
I got racks, that's for sure sure
Keep a stick, ain't talkin' pogo
Met a plug, I dropped the price and copped a two door
Aston Martin foreign but you hear that vroom though
All my pockets full, 4PF like Lil Baby
I feel like MoneyBagg, might just cop a new Mercedes
Diamonds on bling with no flash
So that nigga poppin' for some'
Oh she piped up on the Gram
I bet she fuckin' for some'
I got racks, that's for sure sure
I got gats, talkin' prices my shit too low
I got racks, that's for sure sure
Know they plottin', I ain't worried, keep that draco

[Chorus: Jay5]
I got racks, I'm a king, that's for sure sure
Expensive guns, I keep a draco, ain't for show show
Shawty fit, she bounce on that dick like a pogo
Broke boys coppin' Rollies, I just bust the Hublot
I get racks, that's for sure sure
All these bitches fuckin', that's for sure sure
Oh you trappin', can't compete, my prices too low
She don't swallow, pull out, nut all on her kudo

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
She all on my ass like a low jack
Hid them packs under your step like a dopeman
Something 'bout her swagger like a foreman
Every picture she take perfect, all her Kodak
I ain't going broke no more
How can I when they keep sending these bags for the low
All my niggas they on go, they ain't gon' stop
I'm on par, man for sure for sure
All these diamonds on me water, I just water some more
Nine times out of ten I got that pack in
I ain't hitting the stage if I can't get my scrap in, you dig that
Keep my foot on they neck, for sure for sure

[Chorus: Jay5]
I got racks, I'm a king, that's for sure sure
Expensive guns, I keep a draco, ain't for show show
Shawty fit, she bounce on that dick like a pogo
Broke boys coppin' Rollies, I just bust the Hublot
I get racks, that's for sure sure
All these bitches fuckin', that's for sure sure
Oh you trappin', can't compete, my prices too low
She don't swallow, pull out, nut all on her coolo

[Verse 3: Yakki]
I'm up early chasing racks, for sure for sure for sure
In the traphouse movin' that pack, for sure for sure for sure
Hundred thousand molly in that bag, for sure for sure for sure
Brand new i8 drivin' fast, for sure for sure, yeah yeah
I'm my mama's oldest so I had to
I'm just tryna run me up a bag too
I'm so sick of gettin' all this bad news
I'm just tryna show these niggas cash rules
It's all about them racks, I want that guacamole
Pick me a Patek and went and dropped the Rollie
Talk about the struggle all the time, don't it
We done got it, had to get it, now I shine on 'em

[Outro: Jay5]
For sure for sure for sure
For sure for sure for sure
For sure for sure for sure
For sure for sure for sure
