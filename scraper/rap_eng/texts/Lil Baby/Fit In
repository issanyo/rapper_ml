[Intro]
Earl on the beat

[Chorus]
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind

[Verse 1]
I had a carbon I was fifteen
We tryna steal and rob everything
I can't even talk about what I seen
I'm never telling the laws a thing
Made it out alive, can't even lie that shit was awesome nigga
Shootouts I ain't had no bullets I had to call some niggas
Lost lil Juan in the middle of the summer, that shit was awful nigga
As soon as we found out some witness who tell us who did it, we gon' off them nigga
Had to cut off a couple niggas I thought was with me, tried to cross a nigga
These niggas think they can just come and kick shit in my city, it's gon' cost them nigga
Jumped in the game and went got me some millions, no cap
I made a wave for us
Them bitches were fucking with me when I didn't have no money, now they can't wait to fuck
Every one of my lil buddies mama know we thuggin', that's why they pray for us
I was in the back of the bach like Rosa Parks
Me and my dogs on Tec, a four or more
Grind every day like it ain't no tomorrow
I was just broke, ain't going back
I'ma run mines up to the max
I want the cheese, ain't fuckin' with rats
I wanna fuck her I give her a rack
If she don't give me head ain't texting her back
I'm a dog I go deep in the cat
Remember one time I ain't had jack
I had a hunnid I bought me a pack
I took the pack and went got me a bag
It started rolling and coming in fast
I had the old heads hanging back
Now I'm rich now and that's why they mad

[Chorus]
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind

[Verse 2]
Putting on for the hood like I'm White Boy Marco or something
Super fast car, super bad broad, everybody know a nigga getting money
Couple homies switched up on me when I blowed up now look at them funny
I put the four on my back with no shirt on
I let the homies get bags for the low low
We sending bricks out the spot this the o-zone
I'm the man, rest in peace Shawty Lo
I take the whole gang on the road
Long way from in front of the store
They don't wanna fly they wanna hit the road
They wanna take pistols to all of my shows
We thuggin' in public wherever we go
I did some shit that don't nobody know

[Chorus]
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind
