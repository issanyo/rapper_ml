[Intro: Mafia & Lil Baby]
Yeah, you know it's somethin' to think about
I know how you waitin' for the [?]
I'm not really that friendly dawg
I'm not that friendly
I wonder [?]
Wake up and smoke us

[Chorus: Mafia]
Tiptoein' out the trap, gotta watch out for the rats
I put a draco on the strap, please don't put me on your snap
I'm not that friendly here, I want that Bentley yeah
Gucci and Fendi, Bobby and Whitney
Ice, ice, ice

[Verse 1: Mafia]
I walked into ice
My lil' bitch sweet as ice cream
I know she want a Ralph Lauren, hop on my team
Ferrari, look like Spike, how's the beach sound with some ice?
I know she want me, I'm sorry, check your hygiene
That pussy a lil' spicy, I don't like mine with spice
She's tweakin', need no ice
I thought you was scared of heights
Both my niggas lost they life
For some shit that happened on Bryce

[Chorus: Mafia]
That's why I'm tiptoein' out the trap, gotta watch out for the rats
I put a draco on the strap, please don't put me on your snap
I'm not that friendly here, I want that Bentley yeah
Gucci and Fendi, Bobby and Whitney
Ice, ice, ice

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I'm not your family, I told 'em I don't take no pictures
He askin' me really? Yeah
I pray to god he handle my friends
I think I can handle my enemies
Fu-fu-fully automatic, shoot 'til infinity
[?] it ain't no [?]
I went from rags to riches for real
I gotta keep a low profile
I don't play games, I ain't no child
Just a young nigga thuggin' ready to go wild
We gon' go toe to toe, we don't bow down
What I really want is lovin' that's my child
Ch-ch-check [?] Xan, I'm floatin, they do magic
Disappear when I start clappin'
Most of these rap niggas actin'
They gon' tell twelve when it happened, yeah
Zo2's fat go fast, stirrin, I'm tryna run my cash
In Ohio wit' the Mafia, you must ain't heard
Ain't goin' for now, everywhere I go I got my gun
I'm gon'  shoot back, I ain't gon' run
Gotta make it home back to my son
I gotta make it home, yeah

[Chorus: Mafia]
That's why I'm tiptoein' out the trap, gotta watch out for the rats
I put a draco on the strap, please don't put me on your snap
I'm not that friendly here, I want that Bentley yeah
Gucci and Fendi, Bobby and Whitney
Ice, ice, ice

[Verse 3: Mafia]
I treat her like loose change
She give me head in the back of the Mulsanne
She sick and fed up, she fed up wit' you lames
You could do better than this
Come l- come let's bag a lil' bitch
Don't you know better than this?
You got 'em jealous of this
You gon' get caught mailin' a brick
Get hit in your melon for this
Just keep your mouth closed
This why we don't work on stoves
(that's why we don't work on stoves)

[Chorus: Mafia]
That's why I'm tiptoein' out the trap, gotta watch out for the rats
I put a draco on the strap, please don't put me on your snap
I'm not that friendly here, I want that Bentley yeah
Gucci and Fendi, Bobby and Whitney
Ice, ice, ice

[Outro: Mafia]
Ice, ice, ice
I'm not that friendly here, I want that Bentley yeah
Gucci and Fendi, Bobby and Whitney
Ice, ice, ice
