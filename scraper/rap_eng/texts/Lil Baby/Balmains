[Intro: Project Youngin]
It's the Youngin ho
This Project Youngin man, can't tell me nothin' man
Ain't no more Levis man, ain't no more Trues, ayy

[Chorus: Project Youngin]
Ain't seen my face in a while so now they callin'
She say she miss me, wanna kiss it, I'm like aw man
These ain't skinny jeans bitch, you know these Balmains
I done spent my fifteen hundred on these Balmains
She say she love the way I'm splashin', I be fresh to death
I done designered everything and I Gucci step
I'm all in with this music, no more jokin' now
A couple thousand in my pockets, know it's poking out, ayy

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I stacked it up, I went designer for a year straight
I told that bitch we fuckin' right now, ain't lunch date
I got 'em all on my drip, they like my feng shui
You try to take it, we gon' shoot it out in broad day
FN five-seven in my Balmains
I fucked around gave her the number, she keep callin'
I parked the Fin and came back cruisin' in that Mulsanne
Pillow talking to a bitch, my nigga you lame
Walk around with all this money, you would think I hit the lotto
Pourin' Act out a bottle, 4 Pockets Full the motto
Silverado Forgiato, get a hundred dollar lineup
Got a bad redbone, save her number under model

[Chorus: Project Youngin]
Ain't seen my face in a while so now they callin'
She say she miss me, wanna kiss it, I'm like aw man
These ain't skinny jeans bitch, you know these Balmains
I done spent my fifteen hundred on these Balmains
She say she love the way I'm splashin', I be fresh to death
I done designered everything and I Gucci step
I'm all in with this music, no more jokin' now
A couple thousand in my pockets, know it's poking out, ayy

[Verse 2: Project Youngin]
Walk in the mall, me and my dogs
We got a bag, ain't checking tags, we buy it all
I am my brother's keeper, pick him up if he fall
We ain't dressin' no broads, don't love these hoes at all
Know I'm mackin', come through, I be swaggin'
They pay a G three hunded a P, I ain't braggin'
I keep these bands on me, you know I'm stackin'
Don't think about robbin' 'cause I'm poppin', ain't no lackin'
I done designered my clothes, fuck with foreigner hoes
I done foreigned the whips, in traffic I do the most
I'ma shit on all these niggas that was sleepin' on me
I done Gucci'ed the tees, double G's on my feet

[Chorus: Project Youngin]
Ain't seen my face in a while so now they callin'
She say she miss me, wanna kiss it, I'm like aw man
These ain't skinny jeans bitch, you know these Balmains
I done spent my fifteen hundred on these Balmains
She say she love the way I'm splashin', I be fresh to death
I done designered everything and I Gucci step
I'm all in with this music, no more jokin' now
A couple thousand in my pockets, know it's poking out
