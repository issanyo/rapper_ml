[Intro: Lil Baby]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!
The 12 get behind me, I'ma smash it
That Z06 so fast, hope I don't crash it
Need another load, I sold my last brick

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Exotic my cars and my broads and my reefer, yeah
They say it's cheaper to keep her, yeah
Fuck it, I'm rich so I left her
Shout out the plug, let me keep all the extra, yeah
I just pulled up in a Tesla, yeah
Pour me a four pop of 'Tussin, yeah
Forty pointers in my necklace
Fuck her and dip, ain't got no time for no breakfast, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I'm buildin' shit up like Tetris, yeah
I get the money invested, yeah
I get the pack from the West End, yeah
I send a pack to the West End, yeah
It's drippin', it's rare, you can't catch it, yeah
Servin' raw and fuck the Alphabet Boys
Quarter million, bought a couple of toys
Neighbors trippin', Demon make too much noise
Fifty racks every week off of shows
Movin' cautious like I'm still on parole
I can't fuck with bitches who be doin' the most
Screamin' fuck the system 'til they free all the bros
Shoot a thousand, bet a thousand a roll
If it ain't a thousand, man, that shit ain't no load
Country boys say they lovin' the road
You know me, I'm tryna serve 'em they dope

[Chorus]
Exotic my cars and my broads and my reefer, yeah
They say it's cheaper to keep her, yeah
Fuck it, I'm rich so I left her
Shout out the plug, let me keep all the extra, yeah
I just pulled up in a Tesla, yeah
Pour me a four pop of 'Tussin, yeah
Forty pointers in my necklace
Fuck her and dip, ain't got no time for no breakfast

[Verse 2: Starlito]
Ridin' around with cuz, he got the L's for the straps
Three cell phones in my lap
I'm well known in the trap
Yeah, you know me, yeah, I used to sell your homies a set
Tell my hoes to relax
These niggas police, that's facts
Shots fired, I fleet in a foreign
Do he got a warrant?
My lawyer gon' see you in the morning, Lito ain't goin'
He got that heater when he be performin'
It's a 4 in that liter he pourin'
Baby nem sip like I used to
Love to shoot dice and I do too
Play with my life, I'ma shoot you
I'm way outta town with a pack in a rental
When I ain't rappin', they send 'em
Grindin' up half of a chicken
They catchin' cases, it's all gon' half from a twinner, midget
I rap what I'm livin'
Last whip, I wrecked it and I left it
Fuck it, I'm still livin' reckless
Told my lil' bitch that she selfish
Call up your bestie, I'm tired of fuckin' you separate

[Chorus]
Exotic my cars and my broads and my reefer, yeah
They say it's cheaper to keep her, yeah
Fuck it, I'm rich so I left her
Shout out the plug, let me keep all the extra, yeah
I just pulled up in a Tesla, yeah
Pour me a four pop of 'Tussin, yeah
Forty pointers in my necklace
Fuck her and dip, ain't got no time for no breakfast
