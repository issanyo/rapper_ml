[Intro: Ricki Rich]
Ooh
Yeah
Ooh

[Verse 1: Ricki Rich]
I told my jeweler to double my ice
I told my plug he get double the price
Double the package, I hit it like Mike
I'm in the field, not your typical dyke
Out of the life is too be up all night
Married the streets so you can't be my wife
I smoke Gelato, just look at my eyes
Lil' bitch came up from flippin' them pies
(oh shit, wait)
(take that off)
I could just look at you, tell that you lying
Uppin' my rake, nigga, out on the rise
Money alone make a bitch fall in line
She love me, she hate me, then shoot up them lines
Soft in the game so she hittin' them lines
Sleep in the trap, bitch, I stay on the grind
Walk in that Gucci, that tippy-toe
Textin' you bitch, bet you love that hoe, huh?
(oh shit, wait)
(I'm talkin' too much)
Pull up and stunt 'cause I'm flossin' too much
I got that drop, nigga, I got the touch
Drivin' that foreign, I came from the bus
Sippin' red lean, I came from the 'Tuss
[?], you actin' all tough
Stretchin' my jeans, I think they gon' bust

[Chorus: Ricki Richi]
I woke up to drugs this morn', yeah
Woke up with a new plug this morn', yeah
I woke up with drugs this morn', yeah
Woke up with a new plug this morn', yeah
I woke up with drugs this morn', yeah
Woke up with a new plug this morn', yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Woke up with a new plug this morn'
Quarter million, went and bought a brand new foreign
Balenciaga's, I don't really rock the new Jordans
Hit her once, now she say she feelin' important
These from overseas, so they had to import
Screamin' "Free the gang," middle finger the warden
Patek, Audemars Piguet, all are like water
Drippin' like a faucet, stickin' dick in your daughter
Earrings stay on fleek, my pinky ring cost a quarter
Gettin' them pounds from the border
You can come place your order
Only hit the bitch once, FaceTime, I ignored her
Instagram I explore, couple racks for a whore
Backwoods, need more
Pack goin' out the door

[Chorus: Ricki Richi]
I woke up to drugs this morn', yeah
Woke up with a new plug this morn', yeah
I woke up with drugs this morn', yeah
Woke up with a new plug this morn', yeah
I woke up with drugs this morn', yeah
Woke up with a new plug this morn', yeah
