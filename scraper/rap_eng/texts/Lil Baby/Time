[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Youngin from the project fucked around and got it poppin
I'm like fuck a Maserati, bought my bitch a Bentley truck
G-5 my blood brother he be throwing B’s up
And me, I got Chanel swag, you know I be C'd up
I paid cash for every car, used be the laughing stock
Kept it real, that's why I don't flock
Look at me, I'm on the chart
I don't look down but I'm on top
I don't entertain any clout
Play with me, you gon' get shot for real
Now they can't resist us, hear 'em tryna diss us
Really need to miss us, prolly with your bitch, bruh
I bought her purse off a piece of my endorsement
Richer than my classmates, she know how my kids taste
Now I'm on this cash race, I can't come in last place
I done finally went legit, accountants, I'm a taxpayer
So you know that mean I'm goin' hard 'til my last day
Still can get a thousand pounds a week, the gas way

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I got six watches, I'm ahead of time
I’m goin' all out if it's 'bout mine
I’m gettin' my shine on, I been on my grind
Feel like I'm different, I'm one of a kind
Buy her a Birken Bag, keep her up to par
Baby, you look better naked, you should take it off
Had to play my role, now I'm takin' charge
Just got off parole, made the brodie take the charge

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Bendin' through in that Phantom with them sticks, yeah (Skrrt, skrrt)
All these blues, niggas asking am I Crip yet? (Cuzzo)
Make a move we X you out, ain't goin' tic tac (Brrt)
Put a tag on your toe for all that chit chat (Yeah, yeah)
The richest nigga in my city, that's a big fact (Big fact)
And we don't do them lil' planes, we on the big jet (Big jet)
My dawg still movin' that 'caine, and he ain't quit yet (He ain't quit yet)
I had to tell him when he came, "Don't bring no bricks back"
Feel like I'm the chosen one (Woah)
Rolls truck, I ordered one (Woah)
I ain't mean to buy that bitch a watch, but I bought her one (Ah)
Richard Millie cost a quarter milli', I got more than one (Yeah)
FN on me lighter than a bitch feel like a water gun (Gang)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I got six watches, I'm ahead of time
I’m goin' all out if it's 'bout mine
I’m gettin' my shine on, I been on my grind
Feel like I'm different, I'm one of a kind
Buy her a Birken Bag, keep her up to par
Baby, you look better naked, you should take it off
Had to play my role, now I'm takin' charge
Just got off parole, made the brodie take the charge

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Livin' like a pornstar
Rollie, 7 pointers
Opps finna join us but we ain't switching sides
Neck look like a freezer, ain't savin' no skeezer
They gave me a reason, now they gotta die
I don't want no smoke with you if you don't want no smoke with me
But dawg if you want smoke with me, we switchin' shifts, sleep and creep
I did what they couldn't do, guess that's why they mad at me
But what's up with yo vibe, dawg, why she keep on addin' me?
This my strategy
Keep on stackin' Gs, make 'em proud of me
I went Prada Tees, I went Prada jeans
I want Prada fleece, I'm from poverty
Real talk

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I got six watches, I'm ahead of time
I’m goin' all out if it's 'bout mine
I’m gettin' my shine on, I been on my grind
Feel like I'm different, I'm one of a kind
Buy her a Birken Bag, keep her up to par
Baby, you look better naked, you should take it off
Had to play my role, now I'm takin' charge
Just got off parole, made the brodie take the charge
