[Chorus: Dat Boi Skeet]
This money got me lookin' like a lick
So every day I gotta keep a stick
Fiji water all over my wrist
Patek on me cost a couple bricks
Me and broke together don't exist
Twenty missed calls from your bitch
Didn't change, stick to the script
What you put in's what you get
Did a lot of work for this shit
For times I was hurtin' and shit
Always been deservin' and shit
Knew I had a purpose in this
Bentley truck, swervin' that whip
Wreck got me certain that clip
Dirty thirty burning my hip
Dirty money, turned it legit

[Verse 1: Dat Boi Skeet]
I had to run up a check, had to go get a Patek
Diamonds is water, they wet, she got that water, that wet
I want the most, nothin' less, I had to put on for the set
Double and triple them checks, I got a house on my neck
I told Lil Baby, we 'bout to run it up crazy
A broke bitch never could play me, them hunchos be comin' in daily
I went and bought me a Bentley truck, then I went bought a Mercedes
Daddy he wasn't around, so the streets on the East had to raise me
Young nigga came up servin', twenty-four hours I'm workin'
Bein' broke make me nervous, bein' broke, I think I'm allergic
Ain't gettin' money, you worthless, I'm 'bout to make me a purchase
For all of the times I was hurtin', go and fuck up a check on purpose

[Chorus: Dat Boi Skeet]
This money got me lookin' like a lick
So every day I gotta keep a stick
Fiji water all over my wrist
Patek on me cost a couple bricks
Me and broke together don't exist
Twenty missed calls from your bitch
Didn't change, stick to the script
What you put in's what you get
Did a lot of work for this shit
For times I was hurtin' and shit
Always been deservin' and shit
Knew I had a purpose in this
Bentley truck, swervin' that whip
Wreck got me certain that clip
Dirty thirty burning my hip
Dirty money, turned it legit

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I got some dirty money out the streets
I'm puttin' it up, my lil boy gotta eat
I ain't savin' no ho, I ain't cuffin' no freak
Went from trappin' and standin' up B, no BD
Man these racks gettin' big on my safe, I'm the beast
Most these niggas be vegans, they don't want no beef
I'm like Curry with the thirty, shoot for the three
Got this cash, I'ma buy it, won't rent it, won't lease
Got another nigga's bitch, she fuck me to sleep
Got two flooded watches, Rollie and a Patek
Screamin' free all my dogs 'til they let off they leash
I be super humble, got 'em thinkin' I'm sweet
But they never know I got an FN on me
I been servin' weed and lean and bricks of the D
In my own lane, I don't race, don't compete
I been rollin' up, 'bout a pound of OG
On promethazine, if I don't sip I can't sleep
When it's crunch time, windows down, we gon' creep
Sent a hit then I'm goin' on tour for the week
I been smilin' hard, spend a bag on my teeth
Put my name in a song, you gon' wake up a beat
She gon' give me donut, suck it all 'til I'm weak
And I'm always gon' win, they can never defeat
Stay on my feet, shout out to Skeet

[Chorus: Dat Boi Skeet]
This money got me lookin' like a lick
So every day I gotta keep a stick
Fiji water all over my wrist
Patek on me cost a couple bricks
Me and broke together don't exist
Twenty missed calls from your bitch
Didn't change, stick to the script
What you put in's what you get
Did a lot of work for this shit
For times I was hurtin' and shit
Always been deservin' and shit
Knew I had a purpose in this
Bentley truck, swervin' that whip
Wreck got me certain that clip
Dirty thirty burning my hip
Dirty money, turned it legit

[Outro: Dat Boi Skeet]
This money got me lookin' like a lick
So every day I gotta keep a stick
Fiji water all over my wrist
Patek on me cost a couple bricks
Me and broke together don't exist
Twenty missed calls from your bitch
Didn't change, stick to the script
What you put in's what you get
