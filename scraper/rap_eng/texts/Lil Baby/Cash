[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay
4 Pockets Full, nigga

[Chorus]
Is you mad?
'Cause I'm getting cash
That ain’t my place
Bought a new Wraith
She in my face
I want her head
I want her legs
I want a redhead
I want her head
I want her neck
I want her legs
You don't even beg
We can fuck on the floor
We can fuck in the shower
Leave your friends at the door
Tell 'em give you a hour

[Verse 1]
And they know I'ma GOAT
I got paper and power
Man, these niggas some hoes
Everything they say sour
I bought a Bentley and blew out her brain
Since I got money and people done changed
I'm keepin' my .40, I'm up on my aim
Jump out of line, I bust at your brain
Shoebox money, it ain't nothin' to me
I could make a hunnid in my sleep
These niggas cappin', that's all they see
They just wanna be like me
Takin' this swag and then give it back
I didn't get mad, I went and got more
They just wanna be like him
I don't wanna be like them
Used to wanna be like him
'Til I stayed down and ran up an M
Baby ballin', they should put it on film
Shootin' for bricks, I don't aim for the rim
Fuck the gym, I don't work out
Take a sip of the lean, wash the Perc down
I got on all my jewels, foreign, and all my shoes
These niggas mad 'cause I won't lose
I gotta win, I just began
No fake love, no fake friends
Just 30 in this FN

[Chorus]
Is you mad?
'Cause I'm getting cash
That ain’t my place
Bought a new Wraith
She in my face
I want her head
I want her legs
I want a redhead
I want her head
I want her neck
I want her legs
You don't even beg
We can fuck on the floor
We can fuck in the shower
Hey, your friends at the door
Tell 'em give you an hour

[Verse 2]
I go deep in her throat
Keep that shit on the low
Don't nobody else know
That's our business fasho
We can fuck on the counter
I keep takin' these downers
Pop me a Addi, a Percocet, pour me a four
Baby, we grown, we could fuck on the floor
I'm gettin' money
That's why they mad
That ain't my fault
Nigga, I'm a boss
Get white chalked
Playin' with an OG
I got bags
These niggas owe me, they know me
Standin' in the kitchen and workin' my wrists
I made a duece, turned to a nick
I make a nick, turned to a nine
I made  a nine, turned to a split
You know the rest, I made a split, turned to a brick
We in this bitch, we got it lit
We got them sticks

[Chorus]
Is you mad?
'Cause I'm getting cash
That ain’t my place
Bought a new Wraith
She in my face
I want her head
I want her legs
I want a redhead
I want her head
I want her neck
I want her legs
You don't even beg
We can fuck on the floor
We can fuck in the shower
Leave your friends at the door
Tell 'em give you an hour
