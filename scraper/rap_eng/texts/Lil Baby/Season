[Chorus: JT & Yung Miami]
It's that season (Y'all know what time it is)
Where niggas cut a check for no reason (Where the money at?)
It's that season
Where niggas cut a check for no reason (Where the money at?)
Time to blow a bag, time to blow a bag (Blow a bag)
Time to blow a bag, time to blow a bag (Run it up, ayy)
It's that season
Where niggas cut a check for no reason (Where the money at?)
It's that season
Where niggas cut a check for no reason (Where the money at?)
Time to blow a bag, time to blow a bag (Yup)
Time to blow a bag, time to blow a bag (Ayy)
It's that season where niggas cut a check for no reason

[Verse 1: Yung Miami]
It's that season, you gon' cut it or what?
I want an AP watch, is you gon' flood it or what?
Want a brand new whip, all black, gotta be new body
Wanna get my teeth done and get a new body
Spoiled lil' bitch, and you knew 'bout it (Facts)
So when I ask you for shit, don't get confused 'bout it (Nigga)
Where the boosters?
Where the ones stealin' clothes at? (Where they at?)
Where the trappers? Where the scammers?
Where the zoes at? (Where they at?)
Put me in Dolce & Gabbana, put me in some new shit (Yup)
Fuckin' with a raw bitch, only rock exclusives (Haha)
Makeup, lashes, I gotta get my hair done
You like it when I grip that dick, so get my nails done
(For no reason)

[Chorus: JT & Yung Miami]
It's that season (Y'all know what time it is)
Where niggas cut a check for no reason (Where the money at?)
It's that season
Where niggas cut a check for no reason (Where the money at?)
Time to blow a bag, time to blow a bag (Blow a bag)
Time to blow a bag, time to blow a bag (Run it up, ayy)
It's that season where niggas cut a check for no reason

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Baby
First of all, bitch you got me fucked up
I ain't blowin' shit unless I'm gettin' my dick sucked
Anyway, is you down to let my friends fuck?
Wish I would go and buy a bird bitch a Benz truck
Buy you a couple things, couple thousand
That's what playas do (Yeah)
And then you textin', talkin' 'bout your rent due, fuck you
Answer this, how you a boss and you don't own shit?
Knowin' I ain't chasin' you, you know I got my own bitch
But nails done, hair done, all that shit cheap
Buy a different bitch a lacefront, seven days a week
All you post is Fashion Nova, all of a sudden, you want Gucci
Know I got a lot of money, you won't play me like I'm stupid
Bitch, please

[Chorus: JT & Yung Miami]
It's that season (Y'all know what time it is)
Where niggas cut a check for no reason (Where the money at?)
It's that season
Where niggas cut a check for no reason (Where the money at?)
Time to blow a bag, time to blow a bag (Blow a bag)
Time to blow a bag, time to blow a bag (Run it up, ayy)
It's that season where niggas cut a check for no reason

[Verse 3: JT]
I got my hand out, even when I don't need no handout (Gimme that)
‘Cause I'm a bad bitch, you gotta cash out (You know)
Talkin' big shit, what's your stash ‘bout? (Where it's at?)
You say you gettin' money, we gon' see now (Lemme see)
Nah, I can't settle for it (Nah)
Blow a bag, I might squeeze you in my schedule for it
I glo'd up, it's a whole new level for it
I need your VISA and the pin to the debit for it (Ha)
Ayy, it's that season
Good pussy, niggas know I got that leave-in (Wet, wet)
I told him, “Blow a bag,” he said give him a reason (Boy, what?)
Fuck nigga, don't play with me pay up, or a bitch leavin' (Period)

[Chorus: JT & Yung Miami]
It's that season (Y'all know what time it is)
Where niggas cut a check for no reason (Where the money at?)
It's that season
Where niggas cut a check for no reason (Where the money at?)
Time to blow a bag, time to blow a bag (Blow a bag)
Time to blow a bag, time to blow a bag (Run it up, ayy)
It's that season
Where niggas cut a check for no reason (Where the money at?)
It's that season
Where niggas cut a check for no reason (Where the money at?)
Time to blow a bag, time to blow a bag (Yup)
Time to blow a bag, time to blow a bag (Ayy)
It's that season where niggas cut a check for no reason
