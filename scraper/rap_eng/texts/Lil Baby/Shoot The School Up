[Chorus: Rylo Rodriguez]
I drop that shit, make them youngins go pick them tools up
I drop that shit make them youngins wan' shoot the school up
We know she fuckin' the city, that ho can't fool us
We pick 'em up, drop 'em off, but this ain't a school bus
Take that perc down whole, can't break it down no way
Me and my young niggas we 'bout them bills, just like we OJ
Look what the money bring, it brought so much of pain
It brought some diamond rings, it brought some diamond chains

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I told DT he need to be in school
That's my lil nigga I got him forever
I try to tell 'em that they can do better
It go in one ear then it go out the other
I know you been thuggin' and stuck in the gutter
But you gotta take care your mother
You 'bout to have a lil daughter
You gon' have to think smarter
Baby Tay on the run, he let 12 get his gun
Tyga just got a call say them folks knocking down his wall
I'm like damn what'd you do, he said bruh I ain't shoot
I said man you a man, you know what you gotta do
I'ma send you a good lawyer
I'ma make sure you come home for sure, for sure
Mack, he in trouble again
I'm like damn, you ain't tired of the pen?
Lil Milton been my nigga since we was 10
Ceno, I just really want you to win
Lil Ced my brother forever
We might argue but we sticking together
Travis say he need a lawyer, you know I got some for you
Cuban know we 'posed to went to the league
But fuck, it I'ma still make sure he eat
Shoutout Lil Dee, him and Marquise
They hold it down for spark street
Lil Snoop back locked up, damn man that's fucked up

[Chorus: Rylo Rodriguez]
Drop that shit, make them youngins go pick them tools up
I drop that shit make them youngins wan' shoot the school up
We know she fuckin' the city, that ho can't fool us
We pick 'em up, drop 'em off, but this ain't a school bus
Take that perc down whole, can't break it down no way
Me and my young niggas we 'bout them bills, just like we OJ
Look what the money bring, it brought so much of pain
It brought some diamond rings, it brought some diamond chains

[Verse 2: Rylo Rodriguez]
It brought us Rollie watches
The lean in my soda poppin'
I like to perky pop, she like to Milly Rock
Buy me a thirty Glock
Light that xan and we gone make it kick in pronto
Tryna get my niggas off the block just like Mutombo
Know some niggas told on the whole gang
They'll break the code, we don't know names
Heard somebody made the door swang
Probably make it out the dope game
And if a nigga owe me dough, we gon' hold his ass for ransom
If any nigga want smoke, we gon kill 'em like cancer
I'm from jackboy with a full clip
I was clutchin' just in case he was on the bullshit
Made a bitch call her ride, say she ain't suck dick
All my diamonds on skaters, might buy them Trukfit
Fuck a diss song, if it's an issue we pullin' up with it
Some my niggas on the fuck shit, they victims, we the suspects
Fuck a diss song, if it's an issue we pullin' up with it
Some my niggas on the fuck shit, they victims, we the suspects

[Chorus: Rylo Rodriguez]
I drop that shit, make them youngins go pick them tools up
I drop that shit make them youngins wan' shoot the school up
We know she fuckin' the city, that ho can't fool us
We pick 'em up, drop 'em off, but this ain't a school bus
Take that perc down whole, can't break it down no way
Me and my young niggas we 'bout them bills, just like we OJ
Look what the money bring, it brought so much of pain
It brought some diamond rings, it brought some diamond chains

[Outro: Rylo Rodriguez]
Can't break it down no way
Just like OJ
It brought some diamond rings
It brought some diamond chains
