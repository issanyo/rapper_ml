[Chorus]
I know times get hard but it's gon' pay off, it's gon' pay off
Grinding every day, can't take no days off, no days off
Ridin' 'round the city in a brand new coupe
I got a brand new coupe
Ridin' 'round the city with some brand new jewels
I got a bad bitch too

[Verse 1]
Run the money up, can't take no days off
Bitch I'm my own boss, I can't get laid off
Try me, them youngins will take your face off
Try me, them youngins will take your face off
Grindin' every day, I had to get it, had to work with what I had
I went and ran me up a bag
I got these pussy niggas mad
But I ain't doin' shit
Two door coupe, yeah the fast one
Hopped out in the brand new latest fashion
I know they can't stand that lil rich bastard
I'm gon' show my ass, I never had shit
I think I'm a junkie, I need rehab, I'm addicted to the lean
I went and get it with my team
Twenty-thousand on some rings
I bought my bitch a new Celine

[Chorus]
I know times get hard but it's gon' pay off, it's gon' pay off
Grinding every day, can't take no days off, no days off
Ridin' 'round the city in a brand new coupe
I got a brand new coupe
Ridin' 'round the city with some brand new jewels
I got a bad bitch too

[Verse 2]
Savage for the money, goin' hard for my kid
Sometimes I had nightmares 'bout the shit that we did
I come from the jungle, you can't live where I lived
Police they was on me, glad I hid where I hid
Can't sell dope forever, get the money and quit
Then go get the money, turn the money legit
Two four-fives, that's a hard nine
Stayed down for the pay out, now it's my time
I got out of prison at the perfect time
Got out, I was fucked up, bid gave me a dime
Now I got the money, kickin' shit in the sky
Now I got the money, kickin' shit in the sky

[Chorus]
I know times get hard but it's gon' pay off, it's gon' pay off
Grinding every day, can't take no days off, no days off
Ridin' 'round the city in a brand new coupe
I got a brand new coupe
Ridin' 'round the city with some brand new jewels
I got a bad bitch too
