Big drip
Big whip
Big ice
Big bank
EZZY MONEY

[Chorus: Ezzy Money]
My drip is so hard you can’t stand by me (big drip)
My whip is so hard you can’t park by me (skurt)
My ice is so bright you need sun shades (ice)
Just a young red nigga getting paid
My drip is official, yeah yeah
My whip is official, skurt skurt
My jewelry official, bling blaow
I keep me a pistol, fa fa
(Repeat x1)

[Verse 1: Ezzy Money]

Shots fired last time a nigga tried to stop me
Four pockets full how me and Baby rocking (four pockets)
Sneak dissing all that hating boy gets you popped quick (popped)
Million dollars stashed away for a rainy day
Fifty K in my bookbag just to play (just to play)
Truck load coming in every damn day (jugg)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Baby (sticky)
Came through drippin you can’t stand by me (drip)
Big FN shoot at everybody
Middle of the summer we was trappin like a bitch
First AK fell in love with the stick
Put lil shawty on the molly he in love with the grits
I done came a long way from breaking in hittin licks
Ain’t gonna run off on the plug ima stay down and get rich (nope)
New pinky rings on fleek (fleek)
Everything rollin my trap on beat
Whole hundred thousand on me (on me)
Everything facts no cap on me
I-I’m too official to go back and forth
Sh-She too expensive to wear Michael Kors
Whole hundred bricks in a Honda Accord
If she gets pulled over she won’t say a word

[Chorus: Ezzy Money]
My drip is so hard you can’t stand by me (big drip)
My whip is so hard you can’t park by me (skurt)
My ice is so bright you need sun shades (ice)
Just a young red nigga getting paid
My drip is official, yeah yeah
My whip is official, skurt skurt
My jewelry official, bling blaow
I keep me a pistol, fa fa
(Repeat x1)
