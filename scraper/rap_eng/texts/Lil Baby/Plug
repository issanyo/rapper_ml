[Intro]
I'm on that Yo Gotti off the top of the head shit
Shout out to the plug
Tryin' not to go fed shit
Yeah, for sure
Double shout out to the plug, two times
Freestyle

[Chorus]
Yeah shout out to my plug, he show me love
Shout out to my plug, he keep bringing all these drugs
Shout out to my plug, for all these drugs
I ain't never ever thought about runnin' off on the plug, yeah
Shout out to the plug, that's why I'm up
Shout out to my plug, for all these drugs
Shout out to the plug, he keep bringing all these drugs
I ain't never ever thought about runnin' off on the plug

[Verse 1]
Shout out to the plug, he got me super straight
I'm super good, I'm living great
All my pockets super straight
Shout out to the plug, I got them things for cheap
No Kodak, I smoke broccoli
I swear I got that guap on me
Shout out to the plug, got me flexin' in the club
I'm the first young nigga come through Magic, spend a dub
I got fifty on my neck, 'nother dub on my wrist
I got twenty in my ear, when I talk my shit just glist'
These bitches waitin' on me
Got they baby daddies hatin' on me
Make sure you tell 'em that that paper on me
Make sure you tell 'em I ain't never running
Heard them niggas coming for 'em, tell 'em niggas push up on me

[Chorus]
Show me, show me, show me love
Shout out to my plug, he keep bringing all these drugs
Shout out to my plug, for all these drugs
I ain't never ever thought about runnin' off on the plug, yeah
Shout out to the plug, that's why I'm up
Shout out to my plug, for all these drugs
Shout out to the plug, he keep bringing all these drugs
I ain't never ever thought about runnin' off on the plug

[Verse 2]
I don't count it, I just get it, put it up, do it again
All these bitches mad at me 'cause I'm fuckin' on they friends
Hundred twenty three thousand, I just went crazy again
All white glass coupe, I'm a fuckin' loose screw
Hangin' out the sunroof in that SRT Jeep
I can't wait 'til that [?] car come out, I'm gon' be first on the street
Yeah, I got P's for the low
Twenty-five, five low
Rest in peace to Shawty Lo
I'm gettin' money on them niggas
I know they see it, I be stuntin' on them niggas
Stop hatin' nigga, put the bag behind the kid
And I did what I did
I ain't have to hit no licks, ten toes in the bricks
I'm gettin' money nigga

[Chorus]
Show me, show me, show me love
Shout out to my plug, he keep bringing all these drugs
Shout out to my plug, for all these drugs
I ain't never ever thought about runnin' off on the plug, yeah
Shout out to the plug, that's why I'm up
Shout out to my plug, for all these drugs
Shout out to the plug, he keep bringing all these drugs
I ain't never ever thought about runnin' off on the plug
