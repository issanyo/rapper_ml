[Chorus: LouGotCash]
Can't come around, we don't trust you
Ran through the streets with the muzzle
None of my niggas don't tussle
If you want smoke gon' bust you
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Can't come around, we don't trust you
Run through the streets with the muzzle
None of my niggas gon' tussle
If you want smoke gon' bust you
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Got my pistol on me, ain't got time to scuffle
Three hundred racks in all hundreds, sittin' inside a duffel
Come from the block, we didn't have much so all we know is hustle
Red bottoms, they don't got a scuff on 'em
Catch the opps down bad and bust on 'em
Same bitches didn't wanna fuck with 'em
Now them bitches all wanna fuck with 'em
We catch a private jet to LA, we land in two hours
I make a hundred racks every week, I need some new problems
Me and my bitches just be goin' crazy, we got a shoe problem
Money on my line keep on callin'
Friends are dead, I step inside a coffin
Run off on the plug and then we off him
Every night a different city ballin'
They just wanna see me do bad, but I got a lot of new cash
Everywhere I go a blue rag, and I got a lot of blue cash

[Chorus: LouGotCash]
Can't come around, we don't trust you
Ran through the streets with the muzzle
None of my niggas don't tussle
If you want smoke gon' bust you
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Can't come around, we don't trust you
Run through the streets with the muzzle
None of my niggas gon' tussle
If you want smoke gon' bust you
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel

[Verse 2: Kaio Kane]
Fuck all my haters, I don't owe you nothin'
Fuck up a check and then made me another one
I hit the streets, cause some pandemonium
Broke the remote, ain't nobody controllin' him
Slicker than oil when it come to these bitches
No wonder they can't keep a hold on me
Nigga be lookin' like he ain't tough
Got my change up, all this gold on me
Lord knows I done came up
A hundred racks in my sock drawer
But it's not enough 'cause I want more
No it's not enough 'cause I want more
So much money on me, you would think that I grow it on trees in my backyard
I had to get it out the concrete, I feel the need to go that hard
They call me drip lord, leave sauce on the six when I hop out the NASCAR
Bitch got a pitchfork, she bad as hell, tell your ho keep a mask on
I'm gettin' green like a golf course, hit a hole in one with my chains on
I'm gettin' green like a golf course, hit a hole in one with my chains on

[Chorus: LouGotCash]
Can't come around, we don't trust you
Ran through the streets with the muzzle
None of my niggas don't tussle
If you want smoke gon' bust you
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Can't come around, we don't trust you
Run through the streets with the muzzle
None of my niggas gon' tussle
If you want smoke gon' bust you
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
Hundred racks stashed in the duffel
