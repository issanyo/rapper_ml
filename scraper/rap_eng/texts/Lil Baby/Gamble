[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Wanna be me but you can't
Get up and run to the bank
Got water, I drip like a sink
Wrist in the X with the perks and the drink
Foreign engine, push the button to crank, yeah
I fucked that bitch for a pint, swag
I got a dab like a shank
Chopper city like a New Orleans Saint, yeah
I wanna fuck, Gucci bag, I'ma fill this shit up
Came from the hood so I don't give no fucks
You can't see that I got it but it's tucked
You wanna gamble nigga, try your luck
Shootin' dice, rollin' cookies up
Expensive life, you can't do it like us
We mixin' the Act with the Hi-Tech and Tuss

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I know you would if you could
I got rich but I'm still in the hood
Mixin' codeine and caffeine, makin' mud
I just popped me a perc, damn I'm high as fuck
Ooh, she wet, dive in it, I'm swimmin'
Shawty too cool, she wet like linen
Rockin' Cartiers and they tinted
They be tryna do the swag I invented
When I was broke I was never penny pinchin'
Come to your front door, you act like it's tension
Fucked the bitch from Instagram off a mention
El Patron, call the shooters my henchmen
I'm rich like a Carter, I dunk like Vincent
Broke nigga, I can't pay him no attention
Your money ain't long enough, still in the inches
I just touched down with the pack in the trenches
I hit your bitch like a wide receiver
Smoke out the bag, got a lot of reefer
Jumanji Saint Laurent, it's made by a cheetah
I got her real cheap, nigga you gotta keep her
Young nigga come through like jeepers creepers
Servin' sixteen like I just did a feature
Fucked that lil bitch then I'm catchin' amnesia
I'm the HoodWolf, I'm the most hated by PETA

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Wanna be me but you can't
Get up and run to the bank
Got water, I drip like a sink
Wrist in the X with the perks and the drink
Foreign engine, push the button to crank, yeah
I fucked that bitch for a pint, swag
I got a dab like a shank
Chopper city like a New Orleans Saint, yeah
I wanna fuck, Gucci bag, I'ma fill this shit up
Came from the hood so I don't give no fucks
You can't see that I got it but it's tucked
You wanna gamble nigga, try your luck
Shootin' dice, rollin' cookies up
Expensive life, you can't do it like us
We mixin' the Act with the Hi-Tech and Tussan, Pablo Juan

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
You want to gamble nigga, try your luck
I got this pistol on me, I'ma bust
Nigga try rob me, nigga I'ma buck
That's on my mama, I ain't gon' give it up
I make them youngins come and hit you up
I'm in Rari, bruh in Bentley truck
They on my drip, I had to switch it up
Hop out the vert, I got the semi tucked
Got on her skirt, I'm tryna lift it up
Bend over, hit from the back, ayy
Give you a couple these racks, ayy
I'm on that red, I can't stand up
Do whatever to make sure them bands up
I'm a G so you know I'ma man up
Everywhere I go I got them bands tucked
Too much money, I can't hold my pants up
Pinky ring on fleek, tennis chains on fleek
Nothin' 'bout a nigga cheap, I can do this every week, rarely even get sleep
I'm on an Adderall, I'm on that Hi-Tech and that red
I'm on an Adderall, I want some Hi-Tech and that red

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Wanna be me but you can't
Get up and run to the bank
Got water, I drip like a sink
Wrist in the X with the perks and the drink
Foreign engine, push the button to crank, yeah
I fucked that bitch for a pint, swag
I got a dab like a shank
Chopper city like a New Orleans Saint, yeah
I wanna fuck, Gucci bag, I'ma fill this shit up
Came from the hood so I don't give no fucks
You can't see that I got it but it's tucked
You wanna gamble nigga, try your luck
Shootin' dice, rollin' cookies up
Expensive life, you can't do it like us
