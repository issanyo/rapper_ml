[Intro]
We global now

[Chorus]
Bought her baby Gucci strollers (Strollers)
Switch it up and I went global (Global)
Can't play around, I had to grow up (Grow up)
Check out my neck, hell of a glo-up (Glo-up)
These niggas cap and that shit blow up
My dawg rappin', hope he blow up
I need my checks without no hold-ups
I put my city on my shoulders
I told the truth in every story that I told 'em
I fucked around and showed 'em

[Verse 1]
All of my whips got that new car smell
Don't get it twisted, from the 'partments, I just park well
I don't fuck with him, that nigga flawed, send him to voicemail
Catch up with him, push up on him, tell him how we all feel
Made myself a millionaire, only took a year, dawg
Thinkin' bout what I been through, I can make a tear fall
Late night with them youngins, we was creepin', could've killed y'all
We ain't gon' do that internet beefin', that's for bitches, dawg
I went up to space so they hatin', they can't lift off
I can make your bitch eat my kids, every drip drop
I come from trenches, we can't come outside in flip flops
I done came so far, sittin' on the floor, watchin' the tip-off

[Chorus]
Bought her baby Gucci strollers (Strollers)
Switch it up and I went global (Global)
Can't play around, I had to grow up (Grow up)
Check out my neck, hell of a glo-up (Glo-up)
These niggas cap and that shit blow up
My dawg rappin', hope he blow up
I need my checks without no hold-ups
I put my city on my shoulders
I told the truth in every story that I told 'em
I fucked around and showed 'em

[Verse 2]
I put my all into this shit
I worked so hard to get my wrist
It broke my heart but I didn't quit
I had to ball with no assist
I got 'em all on my drip
Go with his move, he gon' get flipped (Yeah)
I had to hustle for a meal, yeah
And now I'm hustling in these M's, yeah
Gave Jock and Dee 200 years
Whenever they call, I let 'em hear
Them lawyers I got gon' lift they spirit
Them niggas know I keep it real, yeah
Sometimes I feel like the floor is giving in on me
I work so hard but I can't stop 'cause they depend on me
I tried to holler, she didn't talk, but now her friend want me
I see through all, and my life flawed, need no lens on us

[Chorus]
Bought her baby Gucci strollers (Strollers)
Switch it up and I went global (Global)
Can't play around, I had to grow up (Grow up)
Check out my neck, hell of a glo-up (Glo-up)
These niggas cap and that shit blow up
My dawg rappin', hope he blow up
I need my checks without no hold-ups
I put my city on my shoulders
I told the truth in every story that I told 'em
I fucked around and showed 'em
