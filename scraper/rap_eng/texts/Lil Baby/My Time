[Chorus]
She all on my drip she just like my vibe
Tell 'em they can step over it's my time
I get what I want and I don't wait in line
Keep poppin' these percs I done got way too high
She all on my drip she just like my vibe
Tell 'em they can step over it's my time
I get what I want and I don't wait in line
Keep poppin' these percs I done got way too high

[Verse 1]
I gotta slow down ain't tryna lose my mind
I got on two watches tryna keep up with the time
Do this for Lil Steve, they gave my lil' homie a dime
You can't see the greatness in me nigga then you blind
I went back to the basics didn't sign
Tryna treat me like I'm basic not I
I got all these blue faces oh my
I'ma stack it to the ceiling, sky high
I been catching all these flights got sky miles
I'd probably spend my last to see her smile
I was just sittin' in the prison goin wild, now I'm standing on stage gettin paid, they like my sound

[Chorus]
She all on my drip she just like my vibe
Tell 'em they can step over it's my time
I get what I want and I don't wait in line
Keep poppin' these percs I done got way too high
She all on my drip she just like my vibe
Tell 'em they can step over it's my time
I get what I want and I don't wait in line
Keep poppin' these percs I done got way too high

[Verse 2]
I think I fell in love with her she way too fine
I can't go back to no prison got to walk a tight line
Niggas act like they don't fuck with me but on my timeline
Gettin' fucked up on the block I had some very long nights
I'ma savage to my heart you can see it in my eyes
If I tell you I'll quit trappin babygirl then I'll be lying
Saint Laurent my jacket, Valentino on my shoes
Take me for a joke they try to treat me like a fool
Super paranoid i don't leave the house without my tool
Hundred bricks in I got it snowing while it's June
Hardly ever see my son that shit hurt me
My bitch act like she don't understand I'm working
I'm like, "how the fuck you think you got them purses?"
And the way you out here actin' you don't deserve shit
Don't keep callin' my phone that shit gettin' worrisomeâ€‹
And I keep drinkin' this lean I'm just gettin' worser

[Chorus]
She all on my drip she just like my vibe
Tell 'em they can step over it's my time
I get what I want and I don't wait in line
Keep poppin' these percs I done got way too high
She all on my drip she just like my vibe
Tell 'em they can step over it's my time
I get what I want and I don't wait in line
Keep poppin' these percs I done got way too high
