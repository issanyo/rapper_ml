[Intro: Bigga Rankin]
You see the only thing I hate more than fuck niggas and flies is a gossiping ass nigga
Let 'em hate on a real nigga and talk from the motherfuckin' sideline
We in the game makin' plays bitch

[Chorus: Yogii]
Bitch I can count you out a sixty out in twenties
I hear these niggas out here beefing 'bout these bitches
But you know me, can’t keep these bitches off my jimmy
Ayy fuck these bitches, my lil nigga caught a sentence
Itchy finger, I be tweaking with that iron
I’m from the 6, I rock my pieces in the 9
I tell them snitching niggas we don’t fuck with 12
Heavyweight, we put that paper on the scale
I never seen so many gangster niggas gossip
Pillow talking, bet you think that he your partner
That ho a freak, you probably think that she your bitch
The way I kick it, you gon' think a nigga rich
Fuck, I need me a lick

[Verse 1: Yogii]
These niggas need 'em some pom-poms, get 'em a bra and a skirt
Kicking shit like I’m from Hong Kong, I keep that burr on my shirt
I put a block on my wrist, I put a block on your bitch
You went and bought her a whip, I hit for a Pappadeaux dish
Catch me kicking at Bellagio at the crap table with the dice out
Told them folks I got my pieces on, you can really gon' cut the lights out
I ain't know that’s your baby mama, I just hit the bitch in her night gown
The proper paper make them pussy niggas pipe down, hah
I tell my youngins mátalo, then that's your ass
Got pressure just because I fucked your ho then what you saying?
Thinking you gon' get some points off me, you met your man
Thinking you gon' get some points off me, you met your man

[Chorus: Yogii]
Bitch I can count you out a sixty out in twenties
I hear these niggas out here beefing 'bout these bitches
But you know me, can’t keep these bitches off my jimmy
Ayy fuck these bitches, my lil nigga caught a sentence
Itchy finger, I be tweaking with that iron
I’m from the 6, I rock my pieces in the 9
I tell them snitching niggas we don’t fuck with 12
Heavyweight, we put that paper on the scale
I never seen so many gangster niggas gossip
Pillow talking, bet you think that he your partner
That ho a freak, you probably think that she your bitch
The way I kick it, you gon' think a nigga rich
Fuck, I need me a lick

[Verse 2: Marlo]
I can count you out a million in some hundreds
Killed the drought nigga, ten straight summers
I ain't mean to fuck your bitch in my pajamas
The bitch she love it man, she know that I’m a stoner
Fuck with Yogii nigga, I'll kill your fuckin' mama
Broad day nigga, you know I don't play nigga
Marlo with that dope, go crazy with that yay nigga
I don't play nigga

[Chorus: Yogii]
Bitch I can count you out a sixty out in twenties
I hear these niggas out here beefing 'bout these bitches
But you know me, can’t keep these bitches off my jimmy
Ayy fuck these bitches, my lil nigga caught a sentence
Itchy finger, I be tweaking with that iron
I’m from the 6, I rock my pieces in the 9
I tell them snitching niggas we don’t fuck with 12
Heavyweight, we put that paper on the scale
I never seen so many gangster niggas gossip
Pillow talking, bet you think that he your partner
That ho a freak, you probably think that she your bitch
The way I kick it, you gon' think a nigga rich
Fuck, I need me a lick

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Quarter million on me right now, I took the right route
Niggas mad 'cause they bitches getting piped down
But my situation make them niggas pipe down
I be in the trenches getting bankrolls
Me, Yogii, and Marlo fuck the same hoes
All my diamonds dancing, I wear rainbows
I just made a hundred thou out a Durango
I ain’t tripping 'bout that shit, that’s how the game go

[Chorus: Yogii]
Bitch I can count you out a sixty out in twenties
I hear these niggas out here beefing 'bout these bitches
But you know me, can’t keep these bitches off my jimmy
Ayy fuck these bitches, my lil nigga caught a sentence
Itchy finger, I be tweaking with that iron
I’m from the 6, I rock my pieces in the 9
I tell them snitching niggas we don’t fuck with 12
Heavyweight, we put that paper on the scale
I never seen so many gangster niggas gossip
Pillow talking, bet you think that he your partner
That ho a freak, you probably think that she your bitch
The way I kick it, you gon' think a nigga rich
Fuck, I need me a lick
