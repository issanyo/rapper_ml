[Intro: Ralo & Lil Baby]
Yeah
Cook that shit up, Quay
Yeah
Four pockets
Woooh
FAM Goon
Baby
Yeah
Uhh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Ralo]
Four pockets on full
My trunk and my hood
I fucked everything that look good
Made millions still in the hood
Different bitches with me every night
I'm a dog but I never bite
Tell Lil Baby we gon' be alright
We ain't going out without a fight
These niggas out of control
They just be hatin' on me right in front of me
I promise I already know
Me and Lil Baby the niggas they wanna be
Got the trap on the back street
Sold a hundred packs last week
Have you ever spent a million dollars?
Nigga you ain't have to ask me
Ay Lil Baby what we doing nigga?

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
We in Lil Cali and Pakistan
I just re'd up with five hundred bands
Make a nigga soft do the running man
You ain't the boss you a runner man
You a bitch you juwanna mann
Me and young Ralo
We set the trends you can follow
I'm pourin' act out the bottle
Then fucked every Instagram model
Screamin' free Joc and Lil Lotto
I'm in the booth catching play
I used to sleep with the jay
I used to sleep with that k
Give a damn what they say
I know all these niggas hate
But they know i'm getting paid
Better stay up out my lane
I created my own wave
I'm on that bullshit taking chains
Niggas be getting, fucking for the fame
Niggas do anything for a name
Boy I do anything for the game
I know my niggas gon' ride for me
Die for me
Sit in jail, do the time for me
I know they never gon' lie to me
I'm make sure every one of them eat
Me and Ralo back to back
Z06 back to back
Lamborghinis and them cats
Do anything for them racks
Taking chances selling packs
We ain't never going back
Ralo tell them where we at
Ralo tell them where we at

[Verse 3: Ralo]
We in Lil Cali and Pakistan
None of these rappers don't stand a chance
Bitch i'm eating like a fat man
I don't need a bitch for a lap dance
Tell them haters go and team up
I seen them ops come clean up
They gone tell you that I been turnt up every time a nigga seen us
Hold up Hold up Lil Baby
Let me slow it down a lil bit
Hold up Hold up switch it up a lil bit
What you gonna do? (Hold up)
Listen
Look, I hit the club and embarrass them niggas
We carry them pistols and having them issues
I told my daughter don't marry these niggas
Compared to these niggas you better than niggas
I jump out the Lamb and I jump in the wagon
You cannot mention my name without bragging
You know that lil nigga Ralo been havin'
I got more money than you and your daddy
I could never be average
Living life so lavish
Watch cost twenty-one thousand
Way before I knew Savage

[Verse 4: Lil Baby]
We in the spot
We making hits
I made a nick
Turned to a brick
Had a Philippe
And it's on fleek
That's on my right wrist
Bust it down Rollie on my right
They think I came up overnight
Found the plug then I took a flight
That shit changed my life
I used to trap on the bike
I could never get it right
Then I finally got it right
Now i'm ballin' like i'm Mike
Got the game air tight
Like a vacuum seal
Made a whole mil off a vacuum seal
Ballin' with no budget and I ain't got no deal
Me and Ralo really selling packs for real
Love my dawg
Know that they would never steal
Free the gang
Hope they get out on they appeal
I been getting fetty popping all these pills
It cost seven thousand when we choose to appear
I'm trying to live my life
I had to wrong my rights
I had to earn my stripes
I had to earn my stripes
