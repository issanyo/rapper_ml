[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I cannot work me no nine to five
I ran up them racks for a living
Try me, it's gon' be a homicide
Everybody gotta get it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
I cannot work me no nine to five
I ran up them racks for a living
Try me, it's gon' be a homicide
Everybody gotta get it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
My lil one just caught him a homi, I gave his lawyer a hundred
We used to grind every summer, we used to peel us a hundred
Now we can do what we wanna
I might go cop me a Hummer, I don't know nothin' but money, but I'ma keep me a burner
Had the block hot as a sauna, in the middle of the winter
I took them trips to go get it
I used to serve out a rental, all of my niggas they with it
Me and my niggas gon' get it, I had to make a decision
Fuck with these bitches or get to these riches
You know me, I went and ran up them digits
Used to be wishing, that shit turned to winning
Damn that shit crazy, it's just the beginning
Hopped out the Hellcat, the clip was extended
4 Pockets Full and I know it look temptin'
Nigga try me I'ma shoot 'til it's empty
The money I made it, I guess it's just in me
They don't really wanna go to war with us
I'ma spend all of my money on bullets
I'ma make them press the issue the fullest
Came out the jungle, it made me a gorilla
I'm gon' be one of the realest

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I cannot work me no nine to five
I ran up them racks for a living
Try me, it's gon' be a homicide
Everybody gotta get it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
I cannot work me no nine to five
I ran up them racks for a living
Try me, it's gon' be a homicide
Everybody gotta get it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it

[Verse 2: Skull-E]
I cannot work me no nine to five, no
That's just some shit I can't do
Lil Baby what it do?
Ayy yo, took the birds up out the coupe
Fuck these bitches by the two, that's just the way that we do it
Everything we do exclusive, we just not talkin' the music
Dot on your head like a Buddhist, ayy yeah
You cannot stop with us and the beat, that's why these pussy niggas hatin' on me
Pop a perc and fuck that bitch back to sleep
Never trust these hoes 'cause these bitches freaks
We the new wave, fuck up the beach
I'm the ruler, nigga don't mention me
And you niggas snitching, I don't fuck with police
And we politicking, handle beef in the street
No one said it would be easy, ayy yo
I thought you would ride for me, how could you mislead me?
Now we goin' up when niggas throw up plummet
I remember nights when I ain't had nothin'
Benihana plate all in my stomach
I just left the mall, I spent me a hundred

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I cannot work me no nine to five
I ran up them racks for a living
Try me, it's gon' be a homicide
Everybody gotta get it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
I cannot work me no nine to five
I ran up them racks for a living
Try me, it's gon' be a homicide
Everybody gotta get it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
