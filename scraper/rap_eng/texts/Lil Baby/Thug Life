[Intro: Youngstar BBG & Lil Baby]
Yeah, know what I'm sayin'
Real BR, ATL shit, yeah
This that weigh 'em on the scale shit
What's the fuckin' business Lil Baby?
Yeah, 4PF, you dig

[Chorus: Youngstar BBG]
Bitch we thuggin' in my city, really step on steppers
And niggas gone off H and hoes goin' extra
Revolver left the scene clean, that's a whole special
And niggas slidin' with them sticks through your whole section
Bitch we thuggin' in my city, really step on steppers
And niggas gone off H and hoes goin' extra
Revolver left the scene clean, that's a whole special
And niggas slidin' with them sticks through your whole section

[Verse 1: Youngstar BBG]
Hold up B, I bring that pressure, beat your whole block nigga
Heard they had evidence, fuck a hundred shots nigga
This boy huntin', give a fuck, I want all mine
Received the dream, told youngin I want all kind
Back on some other shit, wonder if I blow or not
Put me on tour, nigga know we got them stolen Glocks
Psycho from the area where the good don't make it out
Nigga called my booking phone, said he tryna take me out
Fuck, I'm preventing that, the hood I'm respected at
Gettin' it out that same spot where niggas tried to stretch me at
Thirty, that's a dick nigga, I only want the house in hills
Hands on thuggin' nigga, still play the battlefield
I just asked the lord forgive me for my sins nigga
Before that deal, still thuggin' in my Benz nigga
Watch you get picked off, hoes getting pissed off
Fuck a half a thing, this a whole fucking brick off

[Chorus: Youngstar BBG]
Bitch we thuggin' in my city, really step on steppers
And niggas gone off H and hoes goin' extra
Revolver left the scene clean, that's a whole special
And niggas slidin' with them sticks through your whole section
Bitch we thuggin' in my city, really step on steppers
And niggas gone off H and hoes goin' extra
Revolver left the scene clean, that's a whole special
And niggas slidin' with them sticks through your whole section

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Them youngins in my hood done made the murder rate sky high
We shooting niggas dead in they face, we don't do drive-bys
Twenty-five pound play outside of Popeyes
Niggas know don't come around here with that bullshit, not on my side (naw dog)
Nan' niggas they fuckin' with me, yeah I did (yes you did)
Atlanta niggas, I run this city, yeah you dig (yeah you dig)
Push a nigga wig back, big stacks, big (big stacks)
You wrote a statement, you big rat, big (big rat)
Niggas movin' with them steppers and them cutters, nigga
They pull up on your block and it get ugly nigga (ugly nigga)
Caution, shake them haters off me
A couple homies turned they back, I hate I really lost 'em (damn dawg)
Nigga I'm flossin', all this money on me got me feelin' like I'm King James, bitch I got on six rings
Yeah, in 'partment sellin' whole (whole thangs)
I got bricks too of that cocaine (cocaine)

[Chorus: Youngstar BBG]
Bitch we thuggin' in my city, really step on steppers
And niggas gone off H and hoes goin' extra
Revolver left the scene clean, that's a whole special
And niggas slidin' with them sticks through your whole section
Bitch we thuggin' in my city, really step on steppers
And niggas gone off H and hoes goin' extra
Revolver left the scene clean, that's a whole special
And niggas slidin' with them sticks through your whole section
