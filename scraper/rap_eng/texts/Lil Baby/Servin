[Chorus: Lil Ceno]
Servin', I been trappin' all day

Gotta get the money, nigga that's the only way
Halftime came in, nigga that's a play
Servin', I been trappin' all day
Gotta get the money, nigga that's the only way
Halftime came in, nigga that's a play
Call up Lil Baby, send another one on the way

[Verse 1: Lil Ceno]
I been workin' hard, nigga I been grindin'
Just like Lil Baby, fuckin' up my profit on them diamonds
And I'm gettin' to the money, call it perfect timing
And I'm on the block every day with the iron
Man down, nigga dead on the street, uh

Partner took 'em on the run, it's all good, ayy
Free that boy Cali, yeah he still hood, uh

[Chorus: Lil Ceno]

Halftime came in, nigga that's a play
Servin', I been trappin' all day
Gotta get the money, nigga that's the only way
Halftime came in, nigga that's a play
Call up Lil Baby, send another one on the way

[Verse 2: Lil Ceno]
I'm trappin', this gas is real heavy, uh

Young nigga be grindin', young nigga be gettin' it
Your bitch she love my drippin' and pimpin'

Now that we eatin', every day like Thanksgiving

[Chorus: Lil Ceno & Lil Baby]
Servin', I been trappin' all day

Gotta get the money, nigga that's the only way
Halftime came in, nigga that's a play (Ceno what the fuck goin' on lil bro?)
Servin', I been trappin' all day (trap)
Gotta get the money, nigga that's the only way
Halftime came in, nigga that's a play (Ceno I put on for them young niggas, right?)
Call up Lil Baby, send another one on the way (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
16 years old with six figures, I was that nigga
I stayed down and got bigger, text my mama, told her we did it
They want smoke, well we got semis
I don't think these niggas hit me
I stayed down, I ain't change clothes
I ain't have nowhere to go
Now I'm gettin' paid for shows, man this shit was just a dream
But I did it with my team, how the fuck you hate on me?
I been trappin' so hard like I got nothin' else to do
I be goin' so hard like I got somethin' to prove
Try the gang, make the news

[Chorus: Lil Ceno]
Servin', I been trappin' all day
Call up Lil Baby, send another one on the way
Gotta get the money, nigga that's the only way
Halftime came in, nigga that's a play
Servin', I been trappin' all day
Gotta get the money, nigga that's the only way
Halftime came in, nigga that's a play
Call up Lil Baby, send another one on the way
