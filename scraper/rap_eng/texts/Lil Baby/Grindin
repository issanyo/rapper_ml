[Intro: Lil Baby]
I got Yogii with me
I got Marlo with me
I got Yogii with me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I been workin' hard, I been grindin'
Fuckin' up my profit on these diamonds
My new watch say perfect timing
I had to found it and I found it
I just upgraded my bitch, bought her designer
In the hood you tryna find us
Me and my niggas we be ballin'
We gon' go get it regardless

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I been in the trenches, I been grindin' tryna get it
Tryna run me up a ticket
Staying on my ten, I ain't got time for you bitches
I been ballin' hard ain't gon' fall off my pivot
I don't play around with these niggas, don't waste time with these niggas
I need mine and I need it for sure
4PF I'm ridin' for them niggas, I'll die for them niggas
Every time you see me throwin' up fours
Sometimes I be tired, I be sleepin'
I ain't gon' lie, I'm an addict
I can't help it, I be pourin' up fours
I just got 'em in, got 'em gone
Got it all off a phone
I think it's time for us to get a new load

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I been workin' hard, I been grindin'
Fuckin' up my profit on these diamonds
My new watch say perfect timing
I had to found it and I found it
I just upgraded my bitch, bought her designer
In the hood you tryna find us
Me and my niggas we be ballin'
We gon' go get it regardless

[Verse 2: Marlo]
I just killed a couple niggas 'cause they tried me
Playin' with the marbles like fire
They call me lil Marlo, not The Wire
When I get 'em in I supply ya
I just flood the whole block, man you know I had to get it
Tryna run me up a ticket
The bitch bad and she with it
So you know I had to hit it

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I been workin' hard, I been grindin'
Fuckin' up my profit on these diamonds
My new watch say perfect timing
I had to found it and I found it
I just upgraded my bitch, bought her designer
In the hood you tryna find us
Me and my niggas we be ballin'
We gon' go get it regardless

[Verse 3: Yogii]
Shit, now I been gettin' this paper for a minute now
I'm tryna put gangsters in the position now
And I been kickin' flavor so consistent
I know that Lil Baby and Marlo with me, don't start Lil Trippy
Gotta keep that burner on me
I tried to turn some niggas up, they end up turnin' on me
And I don't need a bitch around me she don't serve a purpose
Them niggas fuckin' with you but I heard you're workin'
Woo, you're walkin' dead
I turned myself into a boss instead
My biggest struggle is tryna fit a quarter mill in my barber bag
Might hit your bitch and don't call her back, huh
I been workin' like I want all the cash

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I been workin' hard, I been grindin'
Fuckin' up my profit on these diamonds
My new watch say perfect timing
I had to found it and I found it
I just upgraded my bitch, bought her designer
In the hood you tryna find us
Me and my niggas we be ballin'
We gon' go get it regardless
