[Intro]
Cook that shit up Quay

[Chorus]
I got accuracy when I shoot that stick (that stick)
It ain't gon' jam, I ain't gon' stop, I ain't gon' miss (ain't gon' miss)
I told my PO no more syrup and that I quit (that I quit)
But I was lyin' 'cause I had codeine in my piss
I'm takin' hard drugs, Tylenols, and Adderalls, and Percocets
They keep my faded
Came up out the trenches a millionaire, a nigga damn near made it
Ran it up and lost it all again, damn near drove me crazy
Couple homies owe me think I'm up so they ain't gotta pay me

[Verse 1]
When I hired out my whole team now they my faculty
Ever since I got that bag these bitches after me
She done sent this text that said she pregnant, she said gon' keep it
Thinkin' to myself like how hell did she get my semen?
My lil' nigga can't wait to wild out, they just need a reason
Thousand pounds of gas at the spot like it's Harvest season
My lil' homie thuggin' jus' got out but he keep his heater
I can't let Lil' Tiger out the house, he like to shoot at people
Two seater Beamer on my way to pick this money up
Semi tuck, try your luck, draw down, I won't give it up
Never runnin' from em', we runnin' to 'em, we on that bullshit
Let it slide, catch 'em out in public, we gon' deal with 'em

[Chorus]
I got accuracy see when I shoot that stick (that stick)
It ain't gon' jam, I ain't gon' stop, I ain't gon' miss (ain't gon' miss)
I told my PO no more syrup and that I quit (that I quit)
But I was lyin' 'cause I had codeine in my piss
I'm takin' hard drugs, Tylenols, and Adderalls, and Percocets
They keep my faded
Came up out the trenches a millionaire, a nigga damn near made it
Ran it up and lost it all again, damn near drove me crazy
Couple homies owe me think I'm up so they ain't gotta pay me

[Verse 2]
You gon' pay me when I see you, I need that money
Keep a smile on my face but it ain't funny
When I press the button they smashin' on site
We snuck the pistols in the club, we ain't tryna fight
Free all of my dawgs behind the walls fuck the system
Let em' pull up on me like it's cool, then we gon' flip 'em
Try to tell my man to slow it down but he went missin'
Couple months later I got the word somebody killed him
Man them hollow tips gon' burn when they get inside
Run it up I'm buyin' cars, this my fifth ride
Playin' with the startin' five, it ain't no sixth guy
You can see it in my eye, I won't let shit slide

[Chorus]
I got accuracy see when I shoot that stick (that stick)
It ain't gon' jam, I ain't gon' stop, I ain't gon' miss (ain't gon' miss)
I told my PO no more syrup and that I quit (that I quit)
But I was lyin' 'cause I had codeine in my piss
I'm takin' hard drugs, Tylenols, and Adderalls, and Percocets
They keep my faded
Came up out the trenches a millionaire, a nigga damn near made it
Ran it up and lost it all again, damn near drove me crazy
Couple homies owe me think I'm up so they ain't gotta pay me

[Outro]
They think they ain't gon' pay me but I need mine, I need mine
