[Verse 1: Lil Baby & (DaniLeigh)]
She get a upgrade from a Rollie to AP
She get a Patek on me, if she is a freak
I like her skin tone, she look prettier with me
She know her alphabets but she stuck on double C
She like, "There go my lil' baby
Take my ring from state to state"
Still smell like I'm sellin' weight
I'm on fire, know they hate
All my cars up-to-date
Four by four, niggas know
Ask about me in the city, ain't no joke, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
My lil' baby (Yeah), change your price tag (Change)
That's a upgrade (Up) on the watch, yeah (Woo)
Yeah, I'm hard work (Work) if you want that (Yeah)

Said my lil' baby (Baby), change your life, yeah (Yeah)
That's a upgrade (Up) on your ice, yeah (Woo)

On site, it's so good you miss your flight, yeah (Woo, woo)
It's so exciting (So exciting, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: DaniLeigh]
Been waiting to get with you (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
