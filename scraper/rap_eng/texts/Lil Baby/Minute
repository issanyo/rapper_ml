[Intro]
You digg?
You know what I'm sayin', I'm on that 4PF shit
You know what I'm sayin', I'm on that flooded Patek shit
I'm on that iced out Rollie shit, you digg

[Chorus]
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
I'm a big dawg, a lieutenant
Brand new foreign, I ain't rented it
All the cars came tinted
All the cars came tinted
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
I'm a big dawg, a lieutenant
Brand new foreign, I ain't rented it
All the cars came tinted
All the cars came tinted

[Verse 1]
Hellcat, no scatpack, got a demon too
Beamer truck with the frog eyes, nigga who is you?
I'm gettin' money like rap dudes
I ain't even sold a record fool
All this money on me and it's blue
Neighborhood 6-0 the crew
If I don't do shit I'ma get me a check and I swear I'ma die 'bout these riches
These bankrolls too big for these britches
I heard that these niggas be snitches
I can't fuck with none of these new bitches
They can't wait to tell a nigga's business
I'ma stay on they ass 'til I'm finished
Run it up, it only took a minute
Fake daps and the fake hugs, most of these niggas be some haters
Salt don't kill players, these bitches still need favors
I done ran this shit way up
I can hear 'em screamin' wait up
Drippin' on 'em, I got flavor
Lil nigga get your weight up

[Chorus]
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
I'm a big dawg, a lieutenant
Brand new foreign, I ain't rented it
All the cars came tinted
All the cars came tinted
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
I'm a big dawg, a lieutenant
Brand new foreign, I ain't rented it
All the cars came tinted
All the cars came tinted

[Verse 2]
Percocets got me traumatized
Nigga try me it's gon' be a homicide
They gon' run and hide when it's gunfire
Nigga I ain't lettin' shit slide
They gon' patrol with me, bitch I'm a G
I'ma make 'em fear it, respect it, or check it
I'm one of the real ones, tunnel vision on the way to the millions
Keep me a check, flooded Patek
I fuck with lil shawty, I bought her a Rollie
Pussy niggas tellin' lies, they don't know me
The same niggas talkin' down probably owe me
You a big dawg and I'm a big dawg but they know they motherfuckin' difference
Pushin' pounds, LA Fitness
I got twenty killers with me
I'ma go all the way this year, put it on my son
He gon' be a don, I'ma pop it 'til I'm done
Start throwin' dubs if I run out of ones
These niggas know how we come
Short Dracos with the big old drum
Run through it fast, I'ma break my thumbs, yeah

[Chorus]
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
I'm a big dawg, a lieutenant
Brand new foreign, I ain't rented it
All the cars came tinted
All the cars came tinted
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
I'm a big dawg, a lieutenant
Brand new foreign, I ain't rented it
All the cars came tinted
All the cars came tinted

[Outro]
I'ma pop my shit, ain't gon' bite my tongue, I'ma rock my shoes
I'ma keep my gun, I'ma rock my jewels, I'ma keep my gun
