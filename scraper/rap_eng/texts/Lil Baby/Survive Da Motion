[Intro]
Aye
We really came from that block, nigga, like
Nah sayin'?
Gotta watch yourself
They always watchin'
They gon' have to do they job

[Chorus]
Hopin' that they never find us
Promise they gon' try to hide us
But fuck 'em, I'm buckin', they gon' have to do they job
I'ma take before I starve
Every day it was hard, I been golden since the start
Duckin' feds, runnin' the cars
In the streets ain't no awards
So this Rollie be my trophy
I'm just tryna survive the motions
I'm just tryna survive the motions

[Verse 1]
First of all let me say
Free Lil Jacques and D
Man they been gon' for a long while
Two lifes plus eight five, they got a long time
Damn they got my dawgs in a jam
Free all of my dawgs out the can
Stand on my two feet just like a man
In the yard goin' hard, when I touched down I had a plan
Twenty days, a hundred bands, I did that
You come from the jungle, I can dig that
You can't tell me nothin' 'bout the struggle
Man these streets I'm really in 'em, every day I had to live that

[Chorus]
Hopin' that they never find us
Promise they gon' try to hide us
But fuck 'em, I'm buckin', they gon' have to do they job
I'ma take before I starve
Every day it was hard, I been golden since the start
Duckin' feds, runnin' the cars
In the streets ain't no awards
So this Rollie be my trophy
I'm just tryna survive the motions
I'm just tryna survive the motions

[Verse 2]
Keep my heart open
I been heart broken
Every soda that I drink it got lean inside it
Every nigga who ain't with me swear they livin' inside me
Pour me up some syrup so I can focus
I'm just tryna survive the motions
In the meantime, gotta by my mama a new Benz
Came out hard on them niggas
Fuck who ain't with me, I don't need friends
Niggas mad at me 'cause they hoes on my drip
Nigga fall back 'fore that ho get you killed
Had to crawl back, lost a whole quarter mil
Fuck you and them niggas that's with you, that's how I feel

[Chorus]
Hopin' that they never find us
Promise they gon' try to hide us
But fuck 'em, I'm buckin', they gon' have to do they job
I'ma take before I starve
Every day it was hard, I been golden since the start
Duckin' feds, runnin' the cars
In the streets ain't no awards
So this Rollie be my trophy
I'm just tryna survive the motions
I'm just tryna survive the motions
