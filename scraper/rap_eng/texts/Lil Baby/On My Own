[Chorus: Kade Fresco]
Yeah, did it on my own, yeah
In that foreign now I’m gone, yeah
Fuck a hater I’m too known, yeah
I got money on the phone right now
That’s why iI ain't tryna call you
Got too much money to argue
I cut her off to get my mind right
I cut her off to get my grind right

[Verse 1: Kade Fresco]
I had to jump off the edge, I might just point at the map
Take me a flight, young and I do what I like
She want to fuck for this life
Somehow i got me this coupe
I’m doing laps, running these miles up
My money piled up, now when she call, I'ma just stall her, yeah
I jump up out that coupe lookin' important
The karats on my neck looking so gorgeous
Saying they support me but they forged it
My money come in blue, I feel like Corbin
Now she be calling me baby, I got to keep it R rated
I'ma just hop out the latest, probably go fuck on your lady
I had to pull away, she trying to join the wave
Lil baby gone do what I say, I pull up, get head in the Wraith
I'm keeping it player, I’m getting my weight up
Never let these hoes get in between my paper
I do it major, I pull up foreign
All this water on my wrist, I got it storming
Remember when they said I wasn't important
Remember when they said I couldn’t afford it
When no one had my back I had my own shit
And now they showing love but I don’t want it

[Chorus: Kade Fresco]
Did it on my own, yeah
In that foreign now I’m gone, yeah
Fuck a hater I’m too known, yeah
I got money on the phone right now
That’s why iI ain't tryna call you
Got too much money to argue
I cut her off to get my mind right
I cut her off to get my grind right

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Cut her off to get my grind right, now I’m doing better
If I knew it would be like this I would’ve never kept her
Took it to the top all by my lonesome
Now I got the money, they all want some
When I needed them they didn’t come around though
Now I’m popping, had to build it from the ground up
They tryna tell me I should put the pounds up
And my dawgs untamed, they try to pound us
Took it to the top, had to get it off the block
Keep my gun I’m shellshocked, I be watching out for cops
Just hoping that my past don’t come to haunt me
Everybody want me, but what they want from me?
I’m a boss, I really want shit
YSL jacket, shirt Givenchy
My lil niggas coming like the army
Something like a rocket, had to launch it
If I ain't got no syrup then I can't function
I been down with the gang since free lunches
Had to take it like a man, I hate the punches
Now I’m rocking all these shows across the country
Now I got a whole lot of money

[Chorus: Kade Fresco]
Yeah, did it on my own, yeah
In that foreign now I’m gone, yeah
Fuck a hater I’m too known, yeah
I got money on the phone right now
That’s why iI ain't tryna call you
Got too much money to argue
I cut her off to get my mind right
I cut her off to get my grind right
