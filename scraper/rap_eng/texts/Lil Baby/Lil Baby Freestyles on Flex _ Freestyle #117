[Verse 1]
Mr. Planet had to hop on a lear
[?], these are mirrors
Goin' crazy, had a hell of a year
Big dog when I look in the mirror
Solitary, five carats, my ear
Foreign vibes, I be gettin' 'em here
Off-White jacket, Louis pants, I got [?]
Porsche Panamera, switchin' the gears
I'm the fashion god, I don't gotta drip
Just one hunnid, keep on sendin' these hits
Big blue truck, bitch I'm a crip
Layin' off in my city, Jay Prince
Any disrespect, he gotta get flipped
Not a cheap jeep, bitch it's a benz
Ran it up and I ain't fuckin' wit' them
Bitches mad 'cause I'm fuckin' they friends
I ain't trippin', we could cut off the end
[?] in my account, I got Ms
Free all the bros down the road doin' ten
When they come home we gon' do it again
I don't give a fuck about havin' no friends
Don't give a fuck about havin' no friends
