[Verse 1: Offset]
Hunnid racks stashed in a spoiler (racks)
This money so dirty, a hoarder (dirty)
I tape a brick to se√±ora (brick)
Go ahead and go cross the border (go)
Diamonds that hang like a ornament (ornament)
Sipping on lean like a pharmacist (pharmacist)
Me and my money got partnerships (partnerships)
Two hundred cash to the dealership (hey)
That bitch got that sack and then we flipped the bitch (sack)
Hit the bitch, quit the bitch
Sucking on dick like licorice
Hit her one time and get rid of it (uh)
I'm giving these thots their wish list (thot)
Hunnid round drum that's a biscuit (brrt)
Blocked her, she on dismissed list (blocked)
My diamonds too cold, it's a fixed wrist (cold)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
They thought I wouldn't make it (thought I wouldn't make it)
But now I'm inside (now I'm inside)
Standing ovation, moment of silence (moment of silence)
Hope out the coupe (hop out that coupe), with the FN beside me (that FN beside me)
Bitch from the islands (from the islands), yeah she exotic (yeah she exotic, yeah, yeah)
Ain't got no love for no thot
Bitch is you fucking or not? (fucking or not)
Whoa, whoa
This a sixty thousand dollar watch
I just fish-tailed off the lot
Got it right back out the pot
A young nigga make the hood hot
And fuck it gon' get a new spot
Said fuck it gon' get a new spot

[Chorus: Offset]
