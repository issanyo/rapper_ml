[Chorus: Lil Baby]
All I know is play for keeps, I ain't slept in 'bout a week
Niggas screamin' we got beef, shell casings in the street
You gon' ride or die, you gon' ride or die
Sixteen on the block, had to run me up some guap
Turn some soft into a rock, keep on whippin' 'til it lock
You gon' ride or die, you gon' ride or die

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I know my mama prayin' for me, it's kinda hard for her to sleep
When she hearin' I got beef and I'm really in the streets
But she know her son a G, ain't gon' fold, ain't told
I ain't rolled, when the pressure was on I bust chrome
Six o'clock on the dot, niggas still at the spot
Got a play for three blocks, I might serve 'em or take 'em off
I'm tryna figure it out, fuck it I'ma figure it out

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
All I know is play for keeps, I ain't slept in 'bout a week
Niggas screamin' we got beef, shell casings in the street
You gon' ride or die, you gon' ride or die
Sixteen on the block, had to run me up some guap
Turn some soft into a rock, keep on whippin' 'til it lock
You gon' ride or die, you gon' ride or die

[Verse 2: Marlo]
I'm up early in the morning tryna run me up a bag
But a nigga on the run 'cause the narcs on my ass
I'm slidin' in the I, nigga I'm slidin' in the I
And it's for a pocketful but a nigga playin' for keeps
And a nigga got a drum 'cause a nigga in the streets
So I'm grindin' I, nigga I'm grindin' I

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
All I know is play for keeps, I ain't slept in 'bout a week
Niggas screamin' we got beef, shell casings in the street
You gon' ride or die, you gon' ride or die
Sixteen on the block, had to run me up some guap
Turn some soft into a rock, keep on whippin' 'til it lock
You gon' ride or die, you gon' ride or die

[Verse 3: Bite Da Don]
They havin' pressure 'bout these hoes, we havin' bags of this shit
I got four pockets full and coupe around my wrist
Know I play for keeps I got paper out the street
Pull up at your spot, air that bitch out for a week
I finessed 'em out the cash, Rudy bought the jeep
I was in the flat with beat, we got dracos for the beef
I ain't lyin' I'm a beast, them hoes say y'all niggas cheapskates
Duffel bag full of cash like I hit the sweepstakes

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
All I know is play for keeps, I ain't slept in 'bout a week
Niggas screamin' we got beef, shell casings in the street
You gon' ride or die, you gon' ride or die
Sixteen on the block, had to run me up some guap
Turn some soft into a rock, keep on whippin' 'til it lock
You gon' ride or die, you gon' ride or die
