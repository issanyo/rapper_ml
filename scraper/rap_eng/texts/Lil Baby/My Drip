[Chorus]
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
I came from rags to riches
I fuck the baddest bitches
I came from rags to riches
I fuck the baddest bitches
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
I came from rags to riches
I fuck the baddest bitches
I came from rags to riches
I fuck the baddest bitches

[Verse 1]
Plug talk, I can put you on
Hundred bags of gas, get 'em gone
Made a couple digits off a phone
Diss me, I won't put you in a song
All my youngins put in work
They gon' put you on a shirt
The last nigga got murked
I prayed about it at church
All I think about is drinkin' syrup
I been gettin' faded, poppin' percs
All my diamonds water, you can surf
Porsche 911, it's a vert
Oh they doin' that, I did it first
Fuck you give me ten for a verse
Nightmares, I'm gon' be the worst
All my problems put 'em in a hearse
Fuck her good, buy that bitch a purse
Eat the pussy, blame it on the perc
Nigga you was rappin', you a jerk
I was really trappin', nigga servin'
Quarter million, put it in the air
Grover called me, told me that it's there
Rich nigga rockin' Moncler
Change of plans, I ain't playin' fair

[Chorus]
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
I came from rags to riches
I fuck the baddest bitches
I came from rags to riches
I fuck the baddest bitches
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
I came from rags to riches
I fuck the baddest bitches
I came from rags to riches
I fuck the baddest bitches

[Verse 2]
Givenchy, Givenchy, Givenchy
I rock Givenchy, I do this shit for a living
The narcs in the hood, they been trippin'
All in my business, so all my rental cars tinted
Boy I ain't been broke in a minute, I swear I been gettin' it
Still sendin' packs to the prison
Run the money all the way up, wonderful feeling
Bust down Rollies came from scratch
Catch a nigga slipping, do him bad
Take a nigga's shit, won't give it back
Half a bag, get a nigga whacked
Wreck the Masi, go and get a Jag
Hellcat goin' real fast
Fuck 12, I ain't goin' back
Do it for the shit I never had
Niggas droppin' salt 'cause they mad
They don't wanna see me with a bag
A lot of times I just wanna spazz
But I fall back and just laugh
I won't let you trick me out my spot
Niggas having pressure 'bout a thot
These bitches lovin' the crew
We take 'em down by the two

[Chorus]
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
I came from rags to riches
I fuck the baddest bitches
I came from rags to riches
I fuck the baddest bitches
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
I came from rags to riches
I fuck the baddest bitches
I came from rags to riches
I fuck the baddest bitches
