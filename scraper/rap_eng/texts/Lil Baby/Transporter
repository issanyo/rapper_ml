[Chorus: Offset]
How you fit a quarter in a mattress (how, quarter)
Get the brick and transport it through the mattress (transport)
Chopper longer than my arm, who want static (static)
Diamonds got my wrist slit off the glasses (glasses, ice)
We got acres of cabbage (acres)
Surprise a nigga ride up on him on the banshee (brrt, brrt)
We got Ks in the attic (K)
Try to run off with a birdie, kill your daddy (brr, brr)
How you fit a quarter in a mattress (quarter, how)
Get the brick and transport it through the mattress (transport)
Chopper longer than my arm, who want static (brrt)
Diamonds got my wrist slit off the glasses (slit, ice)
We got acres of cabbage (cab')
Surprise a nigga ride up on him on the banshee (brrt, brrt)
We got Ks in the attic (K)
Try to run off with a birdie, kill your daddy (brr)
