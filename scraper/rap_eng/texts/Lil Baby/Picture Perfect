[Chorus: Strick]
Picture perfect, what is that? (what is that?)
We been through hell and back and somehow stayed intact, yeah
Heaven on earth, you got my back
Ain't no way I switch up on you
Got some precious diamonds for you
Hold up, hold up, relax, relax

[Verse 1: Strick]
Ain't no pressure on the check
You say you want it, you have it (you have it)
Pull up in that spaceship, put you right in the passenger
Put you on the game, teach you to count it up accurate
'Fore I started doing numbers (doing numbers)
If eighty-six was gon' be Fortune 500 (500)
The hurry card came off the extras from teh summer
They watching, we stayin' cautious
We inflating the prices, they tryna make us an offer
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, G code, had to stick to it (stick to it)
Eyes on when they approach and we can see through it
Light my Backwood up from Carly, I'm feeling gnarly
The double-R boss hoggin' like a Harley

[Chorus: Strick]
Picture perfect, what is that? (what is that?)
We been through hell and back and somehow stayed intact, yeah
Heaven on earth, you got my back
Ain't no way I switch up on you
Got some precious diamonds for you
Hold up, hold up

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Picture perfect, I ain't Kodak
Back when we was wearing Girbaud jeans with the bulge asses
Back when I was sellin' dimes of hard in them green sacks
Bring that green back, I hope he bring my team back
My nigga caught a dub for some shit that he ain't do
I'm just glad that he ain't rat, paid his lawyer eighty racks
I got pieces for the whole team, that's priceless
She say I'm the hardest, she tell me I'm the nicest
I go fast like nitrus, bad bitches all on my to do list
Niggas say they popping, they don't do shit
Every time you see me in some new shit
Bad bitch yellowbone, look like Karrueche

[Chorus: Strick]
Picture perfect, what is that? (what is that?)
We been through hell and back and somehow stayed intact, yeah
Heaven on earth, you got my back
Ain't no way I switch up on you
Got some precious diamonds for you
Hold up, hold up, relax, relax
