[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay
I'ma keep going
I'ma keep on going-oing-oing-oing-oing
I'ma keep on going-oing-oing-oing-oing
Yeah

[Chorus]
They say talk is cheap, I let my diamonds talk
2018, it came with auto-park
Sixty-seven thousand on an Audemars
Never leave my niggas, I love all of y'all
Takin' all these drugs like I'm a rockstar
Hi-Tech and that Act, I don't drink Wockhardt
I didn't have a car, I used to walk far
Now I'm standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar

[Verse 1]
Whole milly in my safe, could've went and bought a Wraith
I decided I should wait, movin' niggas out the way
Free Tay-K, I beat the case
Got a bank account with Chase
Half a million in my safe
Swear I'm on my way
Screamin' free Kevin Gates
I go and get it by any means
Rockin' red bottoms with Amiri jeans
Pop a percocet, take a sip of lean
I bought real diamonds for the whole team
I been gettin' money since thirteen
I been grinding hard, stayin' lowkey
Sellin' whole bags of the OG
Get you knocked off for a low fee
Diamonds hittin' hard, no lights needed
Run it up fast like light speed
Runnin' up the cost in a white tee
I don't go on dates, we fuckin' right now
Make 'em treat me like a king, I got 'em bowing down

[Chorus]
They say talk is cheap, I let my diamonds talk
2018, it came with auto-park
Sixty-seven thousand on an Audemars
Never leave my niggas, I love all of y'all
Takin' all these drugs like I'm a rockstar
Hi-Tech and that Act, I don't drink Wockhardt
I didn't have a car, I used to walk far
Now I'm standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar

[Verse 2]
Rockstar status me
My last bitch abandoned me
We could've had a family
That shit made a man of me
I got niggas mad at me
Niggas I ain't never seen
I don't drink green lean
I fell in love with codeine
Jumpin' on the stage, look at the crowd, I got 'em goin' wild
Only rock the latest, they all on me, checkin' out my style
Chain gang, sittin' in the cell I had my first child
Mama tried to keep me in the house but I was runnin' wild
Sellin' nicks and dimes to the fiends at the West End Mall
Come through in a brand new Hellcat, I had 'em hatin' hard
You ain't got no haters you ain't poppin', keep 'em on they job
Came up in the trenches with them hustlers, I ain't have no job

[Chorus]
They say talk is cheap, I let my diamonds talk
2018, it came with auto-park
Sixty-seven thousand on an Audemars
Never leave my niggas , I love all of y'all
Takin' all these drugs like I'm a rockstar
Hi-Tech and that Act, I don't drink Wockhardt
I didn't have a car, I used to walk far
Now I'm standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar

[Outro]
Standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar
Standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar
Standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar
I don't go on dates, we fuckin' right now
Bitch never forget that I'm a trap star
I'm a trap star
I'm a trap star
I'm a trap star
