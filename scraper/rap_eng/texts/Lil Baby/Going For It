[Intro]
Cook that shit up Quay
Yeah yeah
I come from the cook up, that's all I know
Cook that shit up Quay

[Chorus]
They thinkin' I ain't gettin' no money 'cause I never show it
I'm tryna run me up a whole dime and I'm goin' for it
Fuck I look like takin' chances
Fuck this money, go and blow it
I'm tryna run mine up, I gotta put mine up
Puttin' up the money for lil Jason 'cause he growin' up
I do four shows every week, man I'm blowin' up
Last month I got seven, this month I want ten, I'm goin' up
They tryna stop my shine, but they can't stop my shine

[Verse 1]
I just bought a brand new Rolex
I'm a million dollar nigga, no flex
Stretch these pounds, change my name to Boflex
Hit your baby mama, now your ho next
I want a rose gold on the Patek
I want a regular one, I want it faster
I'm doing numbers, call it mathematics
I had a half a ticket in the attic
It ain't gon' never stop, I'm everlasting
They know how I come, they know how I come
They know how I come
They know how I come before I get there
Cross 'em over, Raf Simmons footwear
Balenciaga runners, these my fifth pair
Ten figure nigga, I'ma get there
Traphouse bunkin', we don't live here
Could've been gone but I'm still here
Pints of Activis, they the real deal
Used to have to rob and I still will

[Chorus]
They thinkin' I ain't gettin' no money 'cause I never show it
I'm tryna run me up a whole dime and I'm goin' for it
Fuck I look like takin' chances
Fuck this money, go and blow it
I'm tryna run mine up, I gotta put mine up
Puttin' up the money for lil Jason 'cause he growin' up
I do four shows every week, man I'm blowin' up
Last month I got seven, this month I want ten, I'm goin' up
They tryna stop my shine, but they can't stop my shine

[Verse 2]
I'm on parole still, got a password
I'm goin' straight net, fuck the backboard
I remember when I used to ask for it
I don't think back, I just press fast forward
I want happiness, I spend my last for it
Two twenty-five read on the dashboard
Cost a quarter mil and I paid cash for it
Poppin' percs, I ain't thinkin' 'bout last
I'm never pissin' dirty, fuck my PO
Lost it all, got me fucked on my re-up
Bitches talkin' down but fuck it 'cause we up
She act crazy I got booed in Korea
Never thought that rappin' would be my career
I'm a trap star and that's what it is
A couple million five, I ain't signing no deal
Nigga out of line, we gon' spray, you get killed
Draco with the drum, hop out and go dumb
I come from the slum, two fingers and a thumb
Nigga know I chunk it up, rep your set and throw it up
Nigga try to take my chain we gon' shoot up the whole club

[Chorus]
They thinkin' I ain't gettin' no money 'cause I never show it
I'm tryna run me up a whole dime and I'm goin' for it
Fuck I look like takin' chances
Fuck this money, go and blow it
I'm tryna run mine up, I gotta put mine up
Puttin' up the money for lil Jason 'cause he growin' up
I do four shows every week, man I'm blowin' up
Last month I got seven, this month I want ten, I'm goin' up
They tryna stop my shine, but they can't stop my shine
