[Intro: Lil Baby]
Gambling in the hallway
Shootouts in broad day
But I gotta make it home tonight
With my dog if he wrong or right
This that foul play
This that two the hard way
This that two the hard way
This that two the hard way

[Chorus: Marlo & Lil Baby]
Get a lot of money, fuck a lot of bitches, serve a lot of niggas
When the pack in we get a lot of scrilla
I take care my niggas down the road man, I fuckin' miss 'em
A star with a pistol, that make me a shooting star nigga
The ninth ward god
The young nigga gon' shake some' for them boys
Them youngins ain't gon' play about that boy
Swing that stick like a guitar, all I know is going hard
Tryna stay above the odds
Sellin' green, girls, and bars, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Them youngins ain't gon' play about the kid, nah for real
I know if I send the word they gon' kill off the rip
They know they catch up big, Lil Baby I keep it real
I'm tellin' you how it is, fuck how you feel
I was in the trenches with three grams of blow
Soon as I get off this, I'm goin' to buy some more
Lose it all gambling and be dead broke
All I had was hope, now we gettin' them loads

[Chorus: Marlo & Lil Baby]
Get a lot of money, fuck a lot of bitches, serve a lot of niggas
When the pack in we get a lot of scrilla
I take care my niggas down the road man, I fuckin' miss 'em
A star with a pistol, that make me a shooting star nigga
The ninth ward god
The young nigga gon' shake some' for them boys
Them youngins ain't gon' play about that boy
Swing that stick like a guitar, all I know is going hard
Tryna stay above the odds
Sellin' green, girls, and bars, yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Marlo]
Push your lighter bun, get your wig split
Shoot and don't miss, a hundred racks will get your whole fam hit
Do it for my niggas down the road, they got some long beef
For the fact that they ain't never comin' home, be on that fuck shit
Green Dots and J-Pay and PayPal, they gotta eat
I'm a young OG man, shit I get it every week
Ten toes on my feet, I won't fold
If I never sell a record or a song
In the trap I went gold

[Chorus: Marlo & Lil Baby]
Get a lot of money, fuck a lot of bitches, serve a lot of niggas
When the pack in we get a lot of scrilla
I take care my niggas down the road man, I fuckin' miss 'em
A star with a pistol, that make me a shooting star nigga
The ninth ward god
The young nigga gon' shake some' for them boys
Them youngins ain't gon' play about that boy
Swing that stick like a guitar, all I know is going hard
Tryna stay above the odds
Sellin' green, girls, and bars, yeah yeah
