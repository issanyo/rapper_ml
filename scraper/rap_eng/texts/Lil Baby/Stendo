[Intro: Lil Baby]
4PF shit, ya digg?
Them hot boys with me
Long live Jimmy, wish he was still with me
Swear to god every day I wish lil' one was still livin'
Lean fuckin' with my kidney, but I'ma keep on sippin' yeah
Yeah I'ma keep on sippin'

[Chorus: Lil Baby & 4PF DT]
Who the fuck want smoke, nobody
I was fourteen with a bankroll, mask off
Forty on my hip, I lay low
Got some bros that'll shoot when I say so
They'll spray a hundred rounds out the draco
Who the fuck want smoke, nobody
I was fourteen with a bankroll, mask off
Forty on my hip, I lay low
Got some bros that'll shoot when I say so
They'll spray a hundred rounds out the draco

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Fourteen with a bankroll
Only god knows all the shit that I been through
Dead broke when the rent due
I stayed down for the come-up now I'm stunting with my whole crew
Young niggas who with me 'bout whatever, they get cheddar
Boss up on them niggas, I done reached another level
Had some soda and some yola and I put that shit together
Hot boys thuggin', I try to tell 'em do better
I was on the rock gettin' paper
I ain't have no time for no hater
All these bitches tell me they gon' chase me
I don't chase it, I'm not a chaser

[Chorus: Lil Baby & 4PF DT]
Who the fuck want smoke, nobody
I was fourteen with a bankroll, mask off
Forty on my hip, I lay low
Got some bros that'll shoot when I say so
They'll spray a hundred rounds out the Draco
Who the fuck want smoke, nobody
I was fourteen with a bankroll, mask off
Forty on my hip, I lay low
Got some bros that'll shoot when I say so
They'll spray a hundred rounds out the Draco

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Hundred rounds on the Draco
Lil D, he gon' shoot when I say so
All I know is red lives but my niggas on go
I'ma stand up on the block like a fuckin' light pole
Wish I would've stayed in school but I didn't
My mama tried to show me the right way but I didn't listen
But now I'm in the spot, on spark street, in the kitchen
And I'm fifteen but I ran up them digits (I ran them digits up)
Dracos like YoungBoy
I'm a young boy
Tommy gun boy
Just for fun boy
Breakin' in cars, we used to rob, it was hard
We used to starve, we came far

[Chorus: Lil Baby & 4PF DT]
Who the fuck want smoke, nobody
I was fourteen with a bankroll, mask off
Forty on my hip, I lay low
Got some bros that'll shoot when I say so
They'll spray a hundred rounds out the Draco
Who the fuck want smoke, nobody
I was fourteen with a bankroll, mask off
Forty on my hip, I lay low
Got some bros that'll shoot when I say so
They'll spray a hundred rounds out the Draco

[Outro: 4PF DT]
Dracos
Dracos, Dracos, Dracos
Stendos, stendos, stendos
Dracos, Dracos, Dracos
Stendos, stendos, stendos
And we throwin' up them fours
And we pourin' up them fours
Screamin' free all of the bros
Yeah yeah yeah
