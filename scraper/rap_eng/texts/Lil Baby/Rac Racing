[Chorus: Big 36oz]
I want a thousand pounds of weed
I want a thousand bricks of weed
I'm tryna count four thousand hundreds
Put a thousand hundreds on your head
Pull up, let Benji sweep your street, yeah
Lately I been rack racing
Lately I been rack, lately I been rack racing
I want a thousand pounds of weed
I want a thousand bricks of weed
I'm tryna count four thousand hundreds
Put a thousand hundreds on your head
Pull up, let Benji sweep your street, yeah
Lately I been rack racing
Lately I been rack, lately I been rack racing

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Lately I been rack racing, been dying to get this money up
Wrap the truck, mount it up, had to paint the Hellcat
12 been on my ass, they tryna say I run a gang
Every time a body drop they go to throwin' up my name
I'm like I don't even trap no more
I been makin' these K's out the studio
I ain't even been around to serve my folks
I ain't touched a brick in so long
I'm like look don't call my phone, I barely know what's goin' on
It be like damn that's your bro, I seen that nigga at your show
I ain't been it, I ain't in it
I been tryna chase these millions
I been fucking all these bitches
Now my ho won't leave me 'lone
Talkin' 'bout I did her wrong
I'm like fuck that shit, I'm gone
I'm goin' back to the hood
Put all my lil niggas on

[Chorus: Big 36oz]
I want a thousand pounds of weed
I want a thousand bricks of weed
I'm tryna count four thousand hundreds
Put a thousand hundreds on your head
Pull up, let Benji sweep your street, yeah
Lately I been rack racing
Lately I been rack, lately I been rack racing
I want a thousand pounds of weed
I want a thousand bricks of weed
I'm tryna count four thousand hundreds
Put a thousand hundreds on your head
Pull up, let Benji sweep your street, yeah
Lately I been rack racing
Lately I been rack, lately I been rack racing

[Verse 2: Marlo]
I did a thousand pounds a week
Them suckers know I run the streets
I put a hundred on his head
Baby bro make sure he dead
I told Lil make sure the bag right
That young nigga living the fast life
Told my bitch put up a half a million
Gotta make sure that that stash right
Lately I been rack racing then stacking all this damn paper
My niggas say they need me and they know that I'ma feed 'em
If it's pressure then we squeeze 'em
Red dot, I don't like you if you Cleveland
Got a couple crips ridin' with me and I ain't from Four Seasons
I told Lil Baby that I'm with it
Any nigga playin' they get they issue
I sent a hundred fuckin' missiles
He said fuck it, handle business
I told him clear the fucking block
Get out the way, let's set up shop
I sent a hundred fuckin' blocks
Took over the street nigga, we rock

[Chorus: Big 36oz]
I want a thousand pounds of weed
I want a thousand bricks of weed
I'm tryna count four thousand hundreds
Put a thousand hundreds on your head
Pull up, let Benji sweep your street, yeah
Lately I been rack racing
Lately I been rack, lately I been rack racing
I want a thousand pounds of weed
I want a thousand bricks of weed
I'm tryna count four thousand hundreds
Put a thousand hundreds on your head
Pull up, let Benji sweep your street, yeah
Lately I been rack racing
Lately I been rack, lately I been rack racing
