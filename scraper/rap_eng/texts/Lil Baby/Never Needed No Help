[Intro]
Earl on the beat
Yeah, know what I'm sayin'
Know what I'm sayin'? When you create the wave and the vibe
You know what I'm sayin'? You is the vibe and the wave
You know what I'm sayin'?
Never let these niggas catch up what you caught up
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh

[Chorus]
I can do bad on my own and good by myself
I never needed no help
I needed you niggas, you wasn’t right there
You need me, lil' nigga, I’m still gon' be here
My vision was blurry and now I see clear
You wouldn’t believe what I made in a year
Draped in designer, I’m sticky as hell
I run Atlanta, I should be the mayor
I can do bad on my own and good by myself
I never needed no help
I needed you niggas, you wasn’t right there
You need me, lil' nigga, I’m still gon' be here
My vision was blurry and now I see clear
You wouldn’t believe what I made in a year
Draped in designer, I’m sticky as hell
I run Atlanta, I should be the mayor

[Verse 1]
Draped in designer I’m sticky as hell
Whenever we argue I buy her Chanel
Whenever I ain't rappin' I'm sellin' this bail
My nigga got caught, I just hope he don’t tell
If you can sit quiet then I’ll pay your bail
They not gon' snitch if they send me to hell
I put in overtime to get these M’s
Been with the same gang since I was lil'

[Bridge]
Run it up, run it up, run it up, lightspeed fast, yeah (yeah)
Run it up, run it up, run it up, lightspeed fast, yeah (yeah)
Run it up, run it up, run it up, lightspeed fast, yeah (yeah)
Lightspeed fast, yeah (yeah)

[Chorus]
I can do bad on my own and good by myself
I never needed no help
I needed you niggas, you wasn’t right there
You need me, lil' nigga, I’m still gon' be here
My vision was blurry and now I see clear
You wouldn’t believe what I made in a year
Draped in designer, I’m sticky as hell
I run Atlanta, I should be the mayor
I can do bad on my own and good by myself
I never needed no help
I needed you niggas, you wasn’t right there
You need me, lil' nigga, I’m still gon' be here
My vision was blurry and now I see clear
You wouldn’t believe what I made in a year
Draped in designer, I’m sticky as hell
I run Atlanta, I should be the mayor

[Verse 2]
You won’t believe what I made in a year
I’m flippin' these bags, I made me a mill
Then I start rappin' and got me a deal
I took off fast, this shit get for real
She want to talk but she don’t want to hear
All she want me to do is keep it real
She keep on cryin' I'm tired of her tears
I keep on lyin' it just what it is
I'm on my grind, so fuck how you feel
I got some homies who sittin' in the pen
Yeah, yeah
They gon' be sittin' in that bitch for some years
We were some teens, they labeled us grown
Had some judges who doin' us wrong
I know your pain just hold on
Just sing this song

[Chorus]
I can do bad on my own and good by myself
I never needed no help
I needed you niggas, you wasn’t right there
You need me, lil' nigga, I’m still gon' be here
My vision was blurry and now I see clear
You wouldn’t believe what I made in a year
Draped in designer, I’m sticky as hell
I run Atlanta, I should be the mayor
I can do bad on my own and good by myself
I never needed no help
I needed you niggas, you wasn’t right there
You need me, lil' nigga, I’m still gon' be here
My vision was blurry and now I see clear
You wouldn’t believe what I made in a year
Draped in designer, I’m sticky as hell
I run Atlanta, I should be the mayor
