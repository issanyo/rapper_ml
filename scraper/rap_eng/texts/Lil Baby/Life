[Chorus]
I'm just tryna live my life
Moon rocks, on stars, straight cash, no cards
Livin' life like stars, thankin' god every day we finally winning
You was 'posed to my nigga, right here with me
I'm just tryna live my life
They say I ain't living right
Finest cars, designer, and the flashy ice
Livin' for tomorrow, hopin' for tonight
I'm just tryna live my life
They say I ain't living right
Finest cars, designer, and the flashy ice
Livin' for tomorrow, hopin' for tonight

[Verse 1]
Push start cars, we can't fall
Started from the bottom now we here
Ran me up a mil, it took a year
Watch my closest niggas disappear
We ridin' drop tops whips in the summer
She keep checkin' in 'cause she know that I'm a winner
We gon' skip town just for dinner
We gon' keep it gutter, don't have no one in our business
Draped down in Fendi, she rockin' the latest
She say I'm the greatest, if I'm ollie then you later
Took a trip to the Barbados, and I'm still on paper
Shout out to my haters, they been motivating me lately
Came to fuck the game up, had to switch the wave up
Fuck me just don't lay up, on this codeine I can't stay up
Pitch a dub in a motor, just so they can't catch me
They tried to arrest me 'cause I'm icy like Wayne Gretzky
I'm a big bear like Tee Grizzley, these fuck niggas be sneak dissin'
This FN gon' stay with me, a nigga play that'll be the reason
G5 gone for a lot of seasons, Saks Ave, we done did Neimans
Them millions comin', I can damn see 'em
Long live Frank, I can see him breathin'
I got ten traps and they all beamin'
We done fucked the game up
They blowin' my name up
I just want the money, fuck the fame cuz
Came to switch the game up

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna live my life
They say I ain't living right
Finest cars, designer, and the flashy ice
Hopin' for tomorrow, livin' for tonight
I'm just tryna live my life
They say I ain't living right
Finest cars, designer, and the flashy ice
Hopin' for tomorrow, livin' for tonight

[Verse 2]
If tomorrow ain't promised then why should I wait?
If times still gon' be hard then why should I pray?
Seen my niggas fade away, from a cage to a grave
Solid niggas turned fake, seen it happen every day
Didn't expect it to happen, I thought you was solid
Still can't believe you not right here beside me
The money in front me, the bullshit behind me
My nigga forever, I thought we was riders
When we caught them cases both of us kept quiet
I just lost a friend to some gun play
Put my main bitch on the runway
Still servin' packs on the one way
Paying tithes Sunday, we gon' blow up one day
Magic on a Monday, shout out to the strippers
Lately I been feelin' it on another level
Savin' all the extras, I gotta be different

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna live my life
They say I ain't living right
Finest cars, designer, and the flashy ice
Hopin' for tomorrow, livin' for tonight
I'm just tryna live my life
They say I ain't living right
Finest cars, designer, and the flashy ice
Hopin' for tomorrow, livin' for tonight
