[Intro: Gunna]
Matt, what up?
Oh, oh
June, you're a genius
Ah, ah
Ramy on the beat

[Chorus: Gunna]
I want it all, the underdog, I go hard (Go hard)
The word is law, take care of my dogs, from my heart (My heart)
One for all, you gotta walk, we gon' march (March)
Ready for war, wit' my dogs, we gon' spark (Spark)
Started a tour, so I parked my foreigns in the garage (Garage)
Less is more, I pick and choose, keep playin' it smart (Playin' it smart)
S Aventador, my coupe's a sport, I lift up the doors (Lift up the doors)
Fuck these boys, the only thing I fear is God (God)

[Verse 1: Gunna]
The only thing I fear is God (God)
You wasn't there when I was locked down in the pot (Pot)
Went blind, only thing I see is dollar signs (Signs)
Show me loyalty, I'll let you ride (Ride)
Just sip codeine 'cause I just gotta get high (Gotta get high)
I'm savin' my cheese 'cause we done had hard times (Had hard times)
Flew to Belize, I needed a peace of mind (Peace of mind)
I don't know numbers, I had to cut off my line (Cut off my line)
Weave through it all like a 'tilian, none of my kind (None of my kind)
My clothes ain't wrinkled, but I gotta stick with that iron (Stick with that iron)
Your bitch is a cheater, we fuckin', she tellin' you lies (Tellin' you lies)
The heat on these niggas, admit it, shit hard to decide

[Chorus: Gunna]
I want it all, the underdog, I go hard (Go hard)
The word is law, take care of my dogs, from my heart (My heart)
One for all, you gotta walk, we gon' march (March)
Ready for war, wit' my dogs, we gon' spark (Spark)
Started a tour, so I parked my foreigns in the garage (Garage)
Less is more, I pick and choose, keep playin' it smart (Playin' it smart)
S Aventador, my coupe's a sport, I lift up the doors (Lift up the doors)
Fuck these boys, the only thing I fear is God (God)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
One for all, me and my dawgs stay on call
Got a 4x4, it fit so tall, can't fit in garage
Need a rich bitch, I'm like where is Nicki Minaj
Money comin' in, like I play ball, but I don't play ball
And I'm supercharged, I'm a real dope boy
With designer from my head to my toe, I drip hard
I can't pull up in the hood no more, that's what I grind for
Feds tryna listen in on me, think I'm a drug lord
Had to make it to the finish line without no head start
Man I really came from nothin', all I know is to go hard
Me and Gunna, double R, niggas sendin' slingshots
On the tour bus with them killers, stay on Twitter, bitch boy

[Chorus: Gunna]
I want it all, the underdog, I go hard (Go hard)
The word is law, take care of my dogs, from my heart (My heart)
One for all, you gotta walk, we gon' march (March)
Ready for war, wit' my dogs, we gon' spark (Spark)
Started a tour, so I parked my foreigns in the garage (Garage)
Less is more, I pick and choose, keep playin' it smart (Playin' it smart)
S Aventador, my coupe's a sport, I lift up the doors (Lift up the doors)
Fuck these boys, the only thing I fear is God (God)

[Outro: Gunna]
Wheezy outta here
Wheezy outta here
I parked my foreigns in the garage (Garage)
Less is more, I pick and choose, keep playin' it smart (Playin' it smart)
S Aventador, my coupe's a sport, I lift up the doors (Lift up the doors)
Fuck these boys, the only thing I fear is God (God)
The only thing I...
Wasn't there when I was locked down..
Went blind, only... ...is dollar signs (Signs)
....Let you ride
