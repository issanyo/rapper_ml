[Chorus]
Baby why you trippin', I be right here for you
I be right here for you
Anything that you want I will provide that for you
I provide that for you
You know I got bitches, never put none 'em before you
Never put them before you
I get you everything that you want
All I ask that you don't blow my phone up

[Verse 1]
Baby I'm in love, I admit it
I know that you think I want to hit it
But baby I ain't got time for no visits
But baby when I get some time we gon' kick it
Baby we gon' live it all the way up
Just stay down for me, I'm on my way up
Them other bitches already done changed up
Baby is you real or you gon' change up?
Fuckin' with a nigga like me dangerous
Would you still be here if I got banged up?
Man I been through that before, they changed up
Now they be like why he actin' famous?
Baby would you ride for a nigga?
Get on top and do the job for a nigga?
If I need you to run to a nigga (would you run?)
Baby tell me you gon' run to a nigga (you better run)
If you need me I'ma come for you baby (here I come, here I come)
I'ma be right there
If you need me I'ma come to you baby (here I come, here I come)
I'ma be right there
Baby why you trippin', I ain't got time for that
I been tryna get it on my grind for that
Told you pull up, you trip, never minding that
I ain't never answer that, I'm twine with that
You say that you gone well then I'm fine with that
I will never trip, I'm never calling back
I can never fall in love with you no more
I done gave you all of that

[Chorus]
Baby why you trippin', I be right here for you
I be right here for you
Anything that you want I will provide that for you
I provide that for you

[Verse 2]
Forgi's on your whip, I'ma tryna slide on
I been tryna kick it with a rider
Baby I be busy, I be tied up
You ain't gotta love me, just don't lie though
We gon' take them trips 'cause ain't nobody else as fly as us
Baby we gon' let 'em have it
We go where they can't go
Pimpin', where'd my cane go?
I'm the same lil nigga, I ain't changed though
They get salty when I pulled up in that Range Rover
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby why you trippin', I be right here for you
I be right here for you
Anything you needin', I provide that for you
I provide that for you
You know I got hoes, I never put none 'em before you
Never put none 'em before you
Baby you my world and I swear I adore you
And I swear I adore you

[Verse 3]
Late nights, call on the phone
You say where I'm at, I'm on the way
Two hours later you be callin'
Thought you told me you was on the way
Tell you I got caught up, I got busy
But I had another bitch with
Still when I get it there you gon' get it
Soon as I pull up she gon' get it

[Outro]
I ain't got no time for these bitches 'cause I'm on my grind
Baby are you trippin', I been on my grind (I'm grindin')
4PF, you digg?
