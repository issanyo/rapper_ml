[Intro]
D. Sims
Run that back, Turbo

[Verse 1]
Ridin' round on E, racks up to my knees
I can't get no sleep, if I ain't got no lean
Bad bitches follow me, my niggas a part of me
My bitch a hot commodity, I know my grandmom proud of me
I moved my mom from poverty
I hope they don't think 'bout robbin' me
I can fly, yeah I believe
In the cockpit where the pilot be
Don't need no stylist, I style for free
My young ho keep on callin' me, my old bitch keep on stalkin' me
Ain't gon' let a nigga take my shine from me
Should've been rappin', this rhymin' easy
Drop my top just to feel the breeze
Thugger my brother, yeah easy breezy
I just wanna fuck, don't tease me
They got my songs on repeat, yeah yeah
I don't want no money exchange
I went overseas and got some change

[Chorus]
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
Switched up, I guess it wasn't workin'
Came back, guess it wasn't workin'
I think I'm addicted to the perkys
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
Switched up, I guess it wasn't workin'
Came back, guess it wasn't workin'
I think I'm addicted to the perkys
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry

[Verse 2]
Brand new Bentley, hit the block swervin'
12 say they know that I be workin' (fuck 12)
My PO she say I run the game (but I fuck with her)
Every time I see her I throw up the gang, yeah yeah yeah
Really ran the block, really keep a Glock, really serve the rock
Screamin' fuck the cops, screamin' fuck the opps, million in the vault
Oh you a gangster? let's see 'bout it nigga
Had them lil niggas to see 'bout you nigga
Oh you a gangster? let's shoot out lil nigga
Make my lil niggas go 2Pac a nigga
Had a million dollars on the low
I ain't even let nobody know
My role model get them truckloads
Bend her over, fuck her, then I'm gone
Ain't gon' put your name in a song
I'ma put your face on a shirt
I'ma put your body in the dirt
Nigga you a pussy, where your skirt?

[Chorus]
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
Switched up, I guess it wasn't workin'
Came back, guess it wasn't workin'
I think I'm addicted to the perkys
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
Switched up, I guess it wasn't workin'
Came back, guess it wasn't workin'
I think I'm addicted to the perkys
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
