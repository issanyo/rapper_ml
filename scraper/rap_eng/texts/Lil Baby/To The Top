[Intro]
Yeah
Free G-Five, on a G5
Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Toast to 'em all
She said she love me but I know the truth, she been fuckin' my dawg (my dawg and all)
Lately I been feelin' crazy so I ain't been answerin' calls
I just been gettin' the money and savin' it
Keepin' my back on the wall
I'm never gon' fall
Straight to the money no stop
I'ma go straight to the stars
Free all of my niggas sittin' in the cell blocks
I'ma give it all I got
I'ma go straight to the stars
Condo at the top floor
We was so high, you can ask God
You can ask God

[Verse 1]
I know they hate it, I see they faces, they mad I made it
I'm on they ass, I'm gettin' this bag, I ran it up fast
Stand up in they chest no apology
Mama sent a text that she proud of me
Youngins in the hood watchin' out for me
Money all colors like Monopoly
Park the Jeep, hop in the Vet
Stay on they ass, stay on they neck
Keep me a check
Viper came yellow, I painted it red
And I paid cash, you heard what I said
Goin' crazy, I been feelin' the rage
Last year I was sittin' in the cage
This year I'm goin' all the way
Taking drugs, tryna ease the pain
I see 'em watchin'
They on my drip, they tryna follow the wave
They on my page
They know that I'm paid, ain't been in town in days
Most of these niggas they old news
All these bitches been ran through
I'ma save all the fifties and keep the hundreds
Then spend all the dubs on getting money
Straight from the 'jects to a jet
We been gettin' real fly
Free G-Five, on a G5
Balmain denim, no Levis
Strapped to a T, who want war with us
Dually sit up like an armored truck
I brought it out, it's a one of one
Nigga screaming gang, they ain't one of us

[Chorus]
Toast to 'em all
She said she love me but I know the truth, she been fuckin' my dawg (my dawg and all)
Lately I been feelin' crazy so I ain't been answerin' calls
I just been gettin' the money and savin' it
Keepin' my back on the wall
I'm never gon' fall
Straight to the money no stop
I'ma go straight to the top
Free all of my niggas sittin' in the cell blocks
I'ma give it all I got
I'ma go straight to the stars
Condo at the top floor
We was so high, you can ask God
You can ask God

[Verse 2]
Draped down in Gucci, she rock Givenchy, she matchin' my fly
I know it's wrong, but fuck if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
Let's take a trip, if we leave now, we can land tonight
We gon' take a trip to Dubai, guarantee you won't see nobody
Nobody safe where I come from
Young niggas goin' straight dumb
Fifty hollow tips in each drum
Throwing fours up with lil one
Hoppin' out trucks, we suited up, we ready for war, yeah
Yeah that's my boy, that's really my dawg
We went from boys to men

[Outro]
Straight to the money no stop
I'ma give it all I got
I'ma give it all I got
I'ma give it all I got
Straight to the money no stop
I'ma go straight to the top
I'ma go straight to the top
I'ma go straight to the top
