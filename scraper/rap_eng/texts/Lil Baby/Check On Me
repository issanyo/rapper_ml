[Intro]
Check on me

[Chorus: WhooKilledKenny]
Yeah, and I got the check on me
Fuck nigga can't flex on me, tryna steal my recipe (yeah, ay)
A lot in the stash spot, and I ran the block hot, til I had a fat knot
Yeah I got the check on me
I got the check on me
I got the check on me
Yeah I got a check on me
Fuck nigga don't check on me
Can't get no sauce for free, still gotta pay the fee
Yeah I got a check on me

[Verse 1: WhooKilledKenny]
Yeah I got a big, big, big bag
I can get a nigga touched like tag
I don't know you, nigga you gon get taxed
I can't fuck a bitch if she don't get waxed
Smoking on Gelato put me in a vibe
When you talk to me, look me in my eyes
We keep them drums like a marching band
We already fucked, now I want your friend (oh yeah)
Racks on me like I.D, fuck nigga don't try me
Keep the heat right beside me, should've kept it cool like AC
Seen the money, got mesmerized
Flippin' packs like it's advertised
Opportunities, had to capitalize
Dirty money, had to sanitize

[Bridge]
Everyday I wake up, got that check on me
These niggas really mad because I'm next, on me
Self made nigga, got it all out the street
I'm runnin' to the money like a fuckin' athlete

[Chorus: WhooKilledKenny]
Yeah, and I got the check on me
Fuck nigga can't flex on me, tryna steal my recipe (yeah, ay)
A lot in the stash spot, and I ran the block hot, til I had a fat knot
Yeah I got the check on me
I got the check on me
I got the check on me
Yeah I got a check on me
Fuck nigga don't check on me
Can't get no sauce for free, still gotta pay the fee
Yeah I got a check on me

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I got a check on me like I'm from Nike Town (yeah)
Say he up and loaded, we gon knock him down
They gon throw in the towel, the 5th round
We gon break that bitch down like a whole pound (whole pound)
In Miami I'm runnin' with Zoe Pounds (Zoe Pound)
In Atlanta I'm keepin' my trey pound (trey pound)
I done blew up, what they got to say now? (say)
You can get up out my face now (ya feel me?)
Ridin' round with them sticks (yeah)
Pull up on a nigga bitch (yeah)
Ten thousand on my fit (yeah)
Hundred thousand on my wrist (yeah)
I'm sellin' these bricks, they callin' me a brick layer
I fuck a nigga bitch, call me nigga bitch slayer
On the block every morning like Tom Joyner
Ran that shit up, my car foreign
Bitch in the back, I don't need a women
She got a good head on her shoulder
She didn't even get no diploma
Me, myself, and I, I'm a loner
Came up from nothin', I was hungry
Now I got a whole lot of money (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: WhooKilledKenny]
Yeah, and I got the check on me
Fuck nigga can't flex on me, tryna steal my recipe (yeah, ay)
A lot in the stash spot, and I ran the block hot, til I had a fat knot
Yeah I got the check on me
I got the check on me
I got the check on me
Yeah I got a check on me
Fuck nigga don't check on me
Can't get no sauce for free, still gotta pay the fee
Yeah I got a check on me
