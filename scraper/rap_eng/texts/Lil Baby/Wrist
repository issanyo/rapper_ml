[Intro: KC Ruskii]
[?]
Aye, aye, uh, aye, roo, roo

[Chorus: KC Ruskii]
They throw shade 'round me but they stay 'round me
Got a Cuban plug yeah, she from day county (oh yeah)
Like the president, how they always wave 'round me
Made my watch flood like I stay drownin'
When my wrist just like a chef up on a stove
Break it down and push it at the corner store
When my wrist just like a chef up on a stove
Break it down and push it at the corner store

[Post-Chorus: KC Ruskii]
Yeah wit' my wrist, Yeah wit' my wrist
Yeah, yeah wit' my wrist, Yeah, yeah wit' my wrist
Yeah wit' my wrist, Yeah wit' my wrist
Yeah, yeah wit' my wrist, yeah, aye
Wit' my wrist

[Verse 1: KC Ruskii]
Talkin' straight, drop, got a great pop
We was good trappin' 'til the spot got hot
Twelve circlin' the block, say they heard a couple shots
Niggas say that they gon' kill me, yeah I heard that a lot
You ain't never did squat, [?] standard on the guap
We was [?] up them birds, shit I'm talkin' 'bout a flock
All red like this hot, go dead on a thot
'Cause I've been [?] on you woo, she be callin' me a lot
I'm not stressin' you niggas, I got them hittas
I heard you talkin' 'bout shit that you ain't livin'
And I'm a chef in the kitchen but that's a give in
And we was takin' 'cause nothin' was ever given

[Chorus: KC Ruskii]
They throw shade 'round me but they stay 'round me
Got a Cuban plug yeah, she from day county (oh yeah)
Like the president, how they always wave 'round me
Made my watch flood like I stay drownin'
When my wrist just like a chef up on a stove
Break it down and push it at the corner store
When my wrist just like a chef up on a stove
Break it down and push it at the corner store

Made my watch flood like I stay drownin'
When my wrist just like a chef up on a stove
Break it down and push it at the corner store
When my wrist just like a chef up on a stove
Break it down and push it at the corner store

Don't worry I'm wipin' it off

The double G caught me a ticket

[Outro: Lil Baby]
I'm in the kitchen workin' my wrist
They thinkin' that I'm a boss

They thinkin' that I'm a boss

They thinkin' that I'm a boss
