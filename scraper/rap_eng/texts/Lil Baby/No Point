[Intro: Kollision]
I know they mad, these niggas livid
I know they envy, I can see that shit so vivid

[Chorus: Kollision]
No point intended, I just made a quarter milly
Invested in me, shit I worked so hard to get it
Got tunnel vision, they won't knock me off my pivot
They penny pinching, I can tell they barely getting it
I know they envy, I can see that shit so vivid
I'm poppin' shit, I got 'em mad, these niggas livid
No dish detergent, they so washed up like some dishes
Don't guess they pretty, I'ma wake up and go get it

[Verse 1: Kollision]
Came from trappin', nigga having like I'm scammin'
My bitch so classy, ass so fat don't need no panties
The plug didn't show no love, we ran off, he was taxin'
I fuck her on the floor, I put racks in that mattress
And my bitch a diva, ayy
She bad like a cheetah, ayy
And she mad I just beat her, ayy
In that pussy Ike Tina, ayy
Came from whipping up Tina, ayy
Get you pressed like a Kleenix, ayy
They dig my demeanor, hey
My bitch got a bag, come from Birkins
These ain't tinted lil nigga, these curtains
I ain't fuck with you when I was hurting
So I don't fuck with you when I be splurging
Where the fuck was you when I was lurking?
Could've been doing numbers like jersey
Got my feet on they neck, show no mercy
Bitch don't tell me my shirt made in Persian
Sorry no, sorry no apology
She give me head like she knowledge me
I know my mama so proud of me
I am so fly like a pilot be
Bitch turned me to a savage
Shoes came handcrafted
AMG, 4Matic

[Chorus: Kollision]
No point intended, I just made a quarter milly
Invested in me, shit I worked so hard to get it
Got tunnel vision, they won't knock me off my pivot
They penny pinching, I can tell they barely getting it
I know they envy, I can see that shit so vivid
I'm poppin' shit, I got 'em mad, these niggas livid
No dish detergent, they so washed up like some dishes
Don't guess they pretty, I'ma wake up and go get it

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Soon as I open my eyes I'm going to get it
This money keep calling
Went to sleep in the trap house, woke up in a new foreign
Shows coming in back to back, swear to god it feel like I'm tourin'
Label keep trying to get at me, I don't answer, I just ignore them
Dripping on them niggas on a daily basis
Givenchy laces, Tom Ford specs
R-E-S-P-E-C-T me, I'ma die for my respect
I'm a young OG, from the streets
I been going crazy in Givenchy, I been poppin'
Yesterday we had a full shoot out in the 'partments
The police say they know what I be doing, they can't stop it
I told 'em I'm a rapper, ain't no trappin', I'm an artist
Hundred racks stuffed inside these Balmain denims
Screaming free all of my dawgs
If they get jammed I come and get 'em
Some of this shit I can't believe, I be like look at me
Man this shit was just a dream, now I get twenty racks to speak

[Chorus: Kollision]
No point intended, I just made a quarter milly
Invested in me, shit I worked so hard to get it
Got tunnel vision, they won't knock me off my pivot
They penny pinching, I can tell they barely getting it
I know they envy, I can see that shit so vivid
I'm poppin' shit, I got 'em mad, these niggas livid
No dish detergent, they so washed up like some dishes
Don't guess they pretty, I'ma wake up and go get it
