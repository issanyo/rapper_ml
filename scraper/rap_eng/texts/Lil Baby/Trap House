[Chorus: Riff 3x]
I'm back in the trap house (Woo), I'm back in the trap house
(I'm back in the trap makin' plays)
I'm back in the trap house, I'm back in the trap house
(I'm back in the trap servin' jays)
My woes on the road (Ugh), but I'm in the trap house
(I'm in the trap with the yayo)
I just made parole (Hold on), and I'm back in the trap house
(Ugh, ugh, ugh)
I'm back in the trap house (Woo), I'm back in the trap house
(I'm back in the trap makin' plays)
I'm back in the trap house (Ugh), I'm back in the trap house
(I'm back in the trap servin' jays)
My woes on the road (Say what?), but I'm in the trap house
(I'm in the trap with the yayo)
I just made parole (Say what?), and I'm back in the trap house
(Ugh, ugh, ugh)

[Verse 1: Riff 3x]
My woes on the road gettin' that show money (Uh)
I'm in the trenches gettin' dope money (Woo)
Better search him, he might got the fo' money
Y'all fit in, so you takin' no money
I hustle all day, I need mo' money
I'm servin' narcotics for show money
How you hustlin' and you ain't got no money?
Boy, you hustlin' and you ain't got no money?
I trap out of space and I go get that SIG
And I bring that bitch back in my trap in a jam
3601 when I score bitch I slam
Addicted to trappin', that's just who I am
A.K.,the stash, the profit (okay)
Got a hundred rounds hangin' out the rocket (Draco)
I'm the plug that chill with the socket (That right)
These Forges, I don't do Asantis (Three times)

[Chorus: Riff 3x]
I'm back in the trap house (Woo), I'm back in the trap house
(I'm back in the trap makin' plays)
I'm back in the trap house, I'm back in the trap house
(I'm back in the trap servin' jays)
My woes on the road (Ugh), but I'm in the trap house
(I'm in the trap with the yayo)
I just made parole (Hold on), and I'm back in the trap house
(Ugh, ugh, ugh)
I'm back in the trap house (Woo), I'm back in the trap house
(I'm back in the trap makin' plays)
I'm back in the trap house (Ugh), I'm back in the trap house
(I'm back in the trap servin' jays)
My woes on the road (Say what?), but I'm in the trap house
(I'm in the trap with the yayo)
I just made parole (Say what?), and I'm back in the trap house
(Ugh, ugh, ugh)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm back in the trap house (Trap house)
I get off probation a couple of days (Days)
I'm back in the track, ho (Track, ho)
I ran up a mill off a couple of plays (Plays)
I'm winnin', I'm winnin', I'm goin' to get it in a couple of ways, yeah
I got on the same outfit, Gucci slippers, for a couple of days (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I ain't been home in days
Money, I'm goin' to get it
You play me, I'm bustin' you with it (Yeah)
I'm all on the road, I'm doin' these shows
I gotta get rich for my kid (Kid)
I just did the bid, then I came home, then I start doin' it big
Shoutout to Big, he kept it real, now I got millions on mills

[Chorus: Riff 3x]
I'm back in the trap house (Woo), I'm back in the trap house
(I'm back in the trap makin' plays)
I'm back in the trap house, I'm back in the trap house
(I'm back in the trap servin' jays)
My woes on the road (Ugh), but I'm in the trap house
(I'm in the trap with the yayo)
I just made parole (Hold on), and I'm back in the trap house
(Ugh, ugh, ugh)
I'm back in the trap house (Woo), I'm back in the trap house
(I'm back in the trap makin' plays)
I'm back in the trap house (Ugh), I'm back in the trap house
(I'm back in the trap servin' jays)
My woes on the road (Say what?), but I'm in the trap house
(I'm in the trap with the yayo)
I just made parole (Say what?), and I'm back in the trap house
(Ugh, ugh, ugh)
