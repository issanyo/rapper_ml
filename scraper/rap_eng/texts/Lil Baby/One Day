[Intro: Ralo]
Yeah
Ooh, Twysted
Famgoon, yeah

[Chorus: Ralo]
We been trappin' all day, we never take a lunch break
Don't go to church on Sunday but we gon' make it one day
We do it all for the kids whether we broke or we rich
If it ain't making no money then it ain't making no sense
Bro we gon' make it one day, yeah (I swear to God nigga)
Bro we gon' make it one day, yeah (hey Lil Baby we gon' make it out this shit nigga)
We gon' make it one day, yeah (you can bet the house on that nigga)
We gon' make it one day, I swear to God nigga

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
They used to tell me I wasn't never gon' be shit (nah nah)
We was taking shit, stealing cars, hitting licks (yeah yeah)
Sometimes I daydream, I just sit and reminisce (reminisce)
I wish Lil Juan was here, he can't see all this shit (yeah yeah)
We was lit, got big, came up on another level
I just dropped a brick and a half on another bezel
I'm still goin' to church every Sunday, all my niggas know is that gunplay
Told 'em we gon' get rich one day
They didn't believe me, I made 'em see me
S550 Beamer, that bitch the cleanest
I used to work for the cleaners like a mixtape now I finally got rich
Stayed down, finally got rich

[Chorus: Ralo]
We been trappin' all day, we never take a lunch break
Don't go to church on Sunday but we gon' make it one day
We do it all for the kids whether we broke or we rich
If it ain't making no money then it ain't making no sense
Bro we gon' make it one day, yeah (I swear to God nigga)
Bro we gon' make it one day, yeah (hey Lil Baby we gon' make it out this shit nigga)
We gon' make it one day, yeah (you can bet the house on that nigga)
We gon' make it one day

[Verse 2: Ralo]
You can't name a bitch in the club that I can't fuck tonight
Ralo made 'bout ten million bows, I told 'em fuckin' right
I know they in they feelings, I been feelin' like I'm runnin' shit
When I was independent I was gettin' off a hundred bricks
It's a lot of hate in my road but it won't slow me down
I can't concentrate on these hoes 'cause they won't hold me down
I know niggas talk behind my back but I won't ever crack
All them rappers say they movin' packs, we don't believe in that (don't do it)
I met my girl from my best friend
She the one I invest in
I'm the only nigga with a million dollars still livin' in the West End
I'm the only nigga I know
In the hood with a Lambo
Ask the kids who they want to be
When they look at me, they say Ralo

[Chorus: Ralo]
We been trappin' all day, we never take a lunch break
Don't go to church on Sunday but we gon' make it one day
We do it all for the kids whether we broke or we rich
If it ain't making no money then it ain't making no sense
Bro we gon' make it one day, yeah (I swear to God nigga)
Bro we gon' make it one day, yeah (hey Lil Baby we gon' make it out this shit nigga)
We gon' make it one day, yeah (you can bet the house on that nigga)
We gon' make it one day

[Verse 3: Derez Deshon]
I swear to God we gon' make it
They don't give it to us, we gon' take it
They ain't want a nigga on the top floor
So we built it up from the basement
Ralo my fam for real (Famgoon)
Lil Baby my dawg for sure
And we got them bags for real, yeah
And these niggas ain't on the low
We ain't had shit never
Got a rapper bitch in a Tesla
If he mad 'bout it, it's whatever
You know I keep the choppers and Berettas
All my niggas goons and gorillas
Told my Famgoon 4PF
Know we Dirt Gang to the death
Know we Dirt Gang to the death, yeah
We out here eatin', no lunch break, no
We in the streets, these rappers pump fakin', oh
I be in your hood and I ain't never seen you though
I be in my hood every day
It's tatted on me and it's in me bro

[Chorus: Ralo]
We been trappin' all day, we never take a lunch break
Don't go to church on Sunday but we gon' make it one day
We do it all for the kids whether we broke or we rich
If it ain't making no money then it ain't making no sense
Bro we gon' make it one day, yeah (I swear to God nigga)
Bro we gon' make it one day, yeah (hey Lil Baby we gon' make it out this shit nigga)
We gon' make it one day, yeah (you can bet the house on that nigga)
We gon' make it one day
