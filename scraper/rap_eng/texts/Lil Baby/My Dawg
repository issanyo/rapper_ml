[Verse 1]
Hundred thousand dollars on my neck
'Nother fifty thousand on my wrist
Every nigga with me real rich
Niggas havin' pressure 'bout a bitch
I got all my cases dismissed
I don't go back and forth on the internet
Real niggas don't get into that
I'm tryna get in her mouth, for real
I'm tryna get in her mouth (Yeah)
Me and my dawgs, me and my dawgs
We tryna run in your house (Yeah, yeah)
We want them bricks, we want the money (Give me that)
You can keep all of the pounds (Give me that)
I can't be fuckin' these lil bitty bitches
'Cause they be runnin' they mouth (Yeah)
I'm really runnin' this town
Frank Mueller watch for my wrist
'Nother thirty thousand in my fit
Codeine all in my piss (Ooh)
I don't take drugs no more
Baby mama trippin' 'bout a bitch
I'm just tryna take care my kid
I been in the trenches gettin' rich
I don't know another way to go

[Verse 2]
Bust down Rollies for the clique
Got these bitches dancing on the dick
They gon' wait in line for this drip
I'ma give her mine, then dip
I'ma try to kill her for the real
Thirty thousand dollars in my ear
I ain't gotta sign no deal
Made a half a mil' last year
I just came home from the can
20 days, whole hundred bands
Got a nigga feelin' like the man
All these bitches knowin' who I am
Hit the ground runnin', I ain't playin'
Put a hundred bricks in the van
Give a thousand pounds to my man
Blow the money fast as I can
Signed to the streets, no advance
Bitches tryna rip me out my pants
'Cause they heard a youngin' gettin' bands
They don't know that I ain't goin' for nothin'
Only gave the bitch a couple hundred
Big dawg, nigga, you a runner
Run off on the plug, change my number
Drop top coupes for the summer

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's my dawg for sure (My dawg)
Yeah, that's my dawg (My dawg)
Yeah, that's my dawg for sure (My dawg)
Yeah, that's my dawg (My dawg)
Me and my dawg (Me and my dawg)
We gave 'em two in a row (We gave 'em two in a row)
Me and my dawg (Me and my dawg)
We gave 'em two in a row (We gave 'em two in a row)
Deja keep on callin' (Callin')
She say she ready to pull up (Pull up)
As soon as I get there, walk in
I'ma put her in a full nelson (Yeah)
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast
I'm comin' home to get you (I'm comin' home to get you)
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast
I'm comin' home to get you (I'm on my way)

As soon as I get there, I'ma put her in a full nelson
