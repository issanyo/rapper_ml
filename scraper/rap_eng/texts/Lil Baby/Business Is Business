[Intro: Gunna]
Yeah, yah
Uh

[Producer Tag]
Run that back, Turbo

[Intro: Gunna]
Yeah

[Chorus: Gunna]
I tote a TEC 'cause niggas be shady
And a surfboard 'cause we're really wavy
I need some love to go with this hate
Give mama a hug, we finally made it
We puttin' Ms in all the Mercedes
Spend a whole M in the mall, boy you crazy
Bitches ain't shit, bet' not trust your old lady
Business is business, so you gotta pay me

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Uh, Bentleys on Bentleys, we mob through the A
Benjis on Benjis, we stack every day
Business is business, so you gotta pay
New Lamborghinis make me wanna race
Still eat fettuccine I'm stuck in my ways
My bed Tempur-Pedic, I fuckin' get paid
My flow a disease, kill these rappers like AIDS
Yves St. Laurent on the lens of my shades
Gunna back up, I was goin' through a phase
I doubled up and got my bitches straight
You learned how to drip from you watchin' my page
Niggas be tossin', somebody decay
Off-White'd the coupe and the inside is beige
I pop this shit like I've been doin' for ages
So many dead faces I got me a grave
YSL, nigga say "Slatt" every day
I pop me a pill, one got stuck in my throat
This Rollie a Presi', I don't need to vote
Your ho super ready, she at my condo
I stay with that 9, they should call me Marlo
I'm the greatest of all, my emoji is goat
Bouncin' my life, got my back off the rope
Too real I can't turn my back on the bros

[Chorus: Gunna]
I tote a TEC 'cause niggas be shady
And a surfboard 'cause we're really wavy
I need some love to go with this hate
Give mama a hug, we finally made it
Puttin' Ms in all the Mercedes
Spend a whole M in the mall, boy you crazy
Bitches ain't shit, bet' not trust your old lady
Business is business, so you gotta pay me

[Verse 2: Lil Baby & (Gunna)]
Brought out a dub and I'm ready to spend it
You dropped the ball I got it, we winnin'
Spaceship for a car that ain't rented
They know who I am, I ain't walkin' through Lenox
It didn't take long, I ran up them racks
Bought it, ain't like it, ain't takin it back
I shoulda playin' linebacker, I want a sack
I got this cheetah print all on my jacket
I got the belt and the shoes to match it
I'm from the hood, I'm keepin' my ratchet
My bitch the baddest, she ain't bougie, she ratchet
I get him flipped, then I buy him a casket
I'm servin' real, I ain't just singin', rappin'
I got on Soldier Re's, they're classics
I got a 31 doin' gymnastics
I sold a brick, it was still in the package
Sixty five hundred was spent on this coat
(Got a bitch in the condo, she snortin' the coke)
I don't wanna fuck her just want the throat
I'm savin' my money, I ain't goin' broke
Don't want no handouts, that shit ain't no joke
They listen up when I speak, I'm the pope
I'm bringin' cash, ain't payin' no notes
I got the stick just in case they want smoke

[Chorus: Gunna]
I tote a TEC 'cause niggas be shady
And a surfboard 'cause we're really wavy (Surfboard)
I need some love to go with this hate
Give mama a hug, we finally made it (Finally made it)
Puttin' Ms in all the Mercedes
Spend a whole M in the mall, boy you crazy
Bitches ain't shit, bet' not trust your old lady (Bitches ain't shit)
Business is business, so you gotta pay me (Business is business)
