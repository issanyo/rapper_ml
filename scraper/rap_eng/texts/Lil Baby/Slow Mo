[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay
Run that shit from the top, Turbo

[Chorus]
Dope man got extendo
Living room, three Dracos
Sellin' gas like Citgo
Got a ho spot on the sixth floor
I don't ever stay, just give and go
Hope my girl don't never know
These niggas 12, you'll never know
They got paperwork they'll never show
Sippin' syrup, I'm in slow mo
Got it engineered by Turbo
Ridin' 'round in a low low
You only live once, YOLO
I can't drive my car 'cause they know it's me
I don't drive slow, all I do is speed
I'm on Adderall, I don't never sleep
Goin' hard, fuck 'bout who in front of me

[Verse 1]
Nigga out of line, he gon' rest in peace
Shout out big game, he gon' rest in peace
Signed a deal for two mil last week
I get one-five, give the rest to P
I ain't never got to rap, I'ma sit in that trap
I'ma run up them racks, yeah
I was sittin' in that pen, I was still gettin' it in
I ain't never goin' back, yeah
Never save a ho, always give and go
Give her what she want, never tell her no
Grind hard, ain't never goin' broke
I'm rockin' Loub's, I got spikes on my toe
On the yacht, it was me and Lil Boat
I'm a slime, I'll fuck any nigga's ho
Real easy like einy meany miny mo
When she see the money she gon' go
She know I'm a hundred, I ain't told
She know under pressure I won't fold
I ain't goin' fed, I ain't fuckin' with the cops
Y'all niggas lyin', y'all really need to stop
Spray a hundred rounds every time we spray a block
When the beef get to me I ain't never gon' stop

[Chorus]
Dope man got extendo
Living room, three Dracos
Sellin' gas like Citgo
Got a ho spot on the sixth floor
I don't ever stay, just give and go
Hope my girl don't never know
These niggas 12, you'd never known
They got paperwork they'll never show
Sippin' syrup, I'm in slow mo
Got it engineered by Turbo
Ridin' 'round in a low low
You only live once, YOLO
I can't drive my car 'cause they know it's me
I don't drive slow, all I do is speed
I'm on Adderall, I don't never sleep
Goin' hard, fuck 'bout who in front of me

[Verse 2]
Hop out and go crazy nigga, I'm just blazin' nigga
Ain't blood but I'm blazin' nigga, I go crazy nigga
My chain cost one-eighty nigga, I tried to save them niggas
Nigga you can't save that nigga, catch that nigga, spray that nigga
Leave it up to god when it happen
If I wasn't rappin' I'd be trappin'
Rental car, blendin' in with traffic
Gettin' a load in on the tractor
I got 'em scared, they knowin' I'm a factor
Jumped in the game, ran it up faster
Hundred racks bustin' out the plastic
Leavin' Magic City with a dancer
Made myself a boss, I'm from Atlanta
I put a half a pint in the Fanta
FN make it hard to keep my pants up
Ridin' 'round the city in a Phantom
Kidnap a rapper, make him pay the ransom
Niggas be fake, so we don't even dap 'em
They knowin' I'm real, you can go and ask
Before I was rappin' I was gettin' them bags in

[Chorus]
Dope man got extendo
Living room, three Dracos
Sellin' gas like Citgo
Got a ho spot on the sixth floor
I don't ever stay, just give and go
Hope my girl don't never know
These niggas 12, you'd never known
They got paperwork they'll never show
Sippin' syrup, I'm in slow mo
Got it engineered by Turbo
Ridin' 'round in a low low
You only live once, YOLO
I can't drive my car 'cause they know it's me
I don't drive slow, all I do is speed
I'm on Adderall, I don't never sleep
Goin' hard, fuck 'bout who in front of me
