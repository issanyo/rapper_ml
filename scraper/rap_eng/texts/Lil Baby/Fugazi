[Intro: D The Flyest]
It's the flyest in the city and I'm about to take off
It's the flyest in the city and I'm about to take off
And I'm about to take off
It's the flyest in the city and I'm about to take off
And I'm about to take off
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Hook: D The Flyest]
Cartier shades on too don't do fugazi
Designer on all my drip and I ain't basic
My bitch she act boujee, don't do no lame shit
Shoebox money, we stack it don't do no banking
It's getting wicked in the city, bring the 5 out
I've got no feelings, I been a sinner since a damn child
I talk them semis, I talk them glizzys, that's what I'm about
I know the liquor fuck up my liver, still gon' pour it up yeah

[Verse 1: D The Flyest]
I got some bad habits that I can't break
Been drinkin up everyday for like six months straight
Ain't no minimum wage
Taking risks every day
EK up in the cage we don't get no breaks
Sometimes I get tired of the life that I live
Gotta keep a pistol on me
Gotta watch out through the rear
[?] fifty [?] sliding through, looking really [?]
And my homie take 'em perkies and his arms still itch
Just the life that we live in the jungle
Goin' hard every day another rumble
Clip long 'bout the size of Mutombo
Run with that back I could never fumble
If you want a problem I'ma let them hunt you
Dracos and you know we got them drums too
Freak hoes, that's the bitches that we run through
You a snake I could never really trust you

[Bridge: D The Flyest]
Cartier frames keep the shade away from me
Been up for three days let the codeine rain on me
Tryna get away, get up all this pain on me
I'm in a war zone always got that thang on me
Cartier frames keep the shade away from me
Been up for three days let the codeine rain on me
I'm tryna get away, get up all this pain on me
I'm in a war zone gotta keep that thang on me

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Still sippin' on that syrup
Police ride by and we're still flippin' birds
Glock 17, whenever I'm on the curb
If the opp push up on 'em, we gotta handle the business
Free Lil Jock and Dee, they got caught up on some bullshit
Bad bitch trippin', forgettin' that I don't need her
Vac seal bags, but they will never see the freezer
S 65 all mine, no leaser
4 by 4 too tall, they can't keep up
They watching me hard in this foreign tryna peep us
They try to lock me down in a cage until my leash broke
If ever I should fall off, guarantee you I won't be broke
Cops stay calm even though I'm a felony
Even at the top spot I still ain't doing no telling
Tryna take my dawgs farther, ain't gotta listen, I tell 'em
You know I'm going hard if you send them, I gotta sell 'em
