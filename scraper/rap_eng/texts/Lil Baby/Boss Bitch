[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I got too many hoes I can't fuck 'em all
Don't know how to play but I ball
Stacking that money up make it tall
Ooh, the ice on my neck got me frost
Mama ain't made no hoe, she made a boss
My diamonds they shine when the lights turned off
Rocking designer I'm dripping in sauce
All of my diamonds real so they cost
You know it costs to live like this
I got a bad lil boss bitch
Too many diamonds, camera glitch
Yeah I'm shining, I'm frostbit
Ain't got to tell them they know that I'm rich
I got a sack like I run the blitz
Ice cold like I got on mitts
Ice cream I look like a lick

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I made a hunnid in two days
Neighbour trippin' cause I keep the door swangin'
I drop a mixtape today, they gon' be thinking I got me a ghostwriter
AMG on the floor like a low rider
Having rich arguments my whole problem
Running money up I don't see nobody
Buying lawyers for bro 'cause them folks got 'em
Tennis chains on fleek, I could wear a new piece every week
Me and my diamonds all on pee, point
Ask about me, I dug deep for 'em
Hit the bitch Curry, three-point
I can't hit them all so I Pikachu
I don't text 'em I just stick and move
Fresh pair of Loubs

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I got too many hoes I can't fuck 'em all
Don't know how to play but I ball
Stacking that money up make it tall
Ooh, the ice on my neck got me frost
Mama ain't made no hoe, she made a boss
My diamonds they shine when the lights turned off
Rocking designer I'm dripping in sauce
All of my diamonds real so they cost
You know it costs to live like this
I got a bad lil boss bitch
Too many diamonds, camera glitch
Yeah I'm shining, I'm frostbit
Ain't got to tell them they know that I'm rich
I got a sack like I run the blitz
Ice cold like I got on mitts
Ice cream I look like a lick

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Forty pointers that's a waffle cone
Ice cubes on my neck like my styrofoam
Drip, dripping like they left the shower on
Them ain't real, them diamonds are rhinestones
I'm straight I got the iron now
Too many hoes bought another phone
I apologise, AP honeycomb
Shorty walking round with like three hunnid on
Baby vanilla, my rose gold match the Gucci with rose petal
Trapper of the year I need a gold medal
You know the water make the pussy get wetter
Ooh, can't name a nigga that do it better
I got too many hoes like I'm Hugh Hefner
Different foreign bitches, I'ma put 'em together
Yeah they know I'm a trendsetter

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I got too many hoes I can't fuck 'em all
Don't know how to play but I ball
Stacking that money up make it tall
Ooh, the ice on my neck got me frost
Mama ain't made no hoe, she made a boss
My diamonds they shine when the lights turned off
Rocking designer I'm dripping in sauce
All of my diamonds real so they cost
You know it costs to live like this
I got a bad lil boss bitch
Too many diamonds, camera glitch
Yeah I'm shining, I'm frostbit
Ain't got to tell them they know that I'm rich
I got a sack like I run the blitz
Ice cold like I got on mitts
Ice cream I look like a lick
