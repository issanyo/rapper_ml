[Chorus: lil baby]

4 by 4 trucks, pull up big as fuck
I ain’t never had shit
Now a nigga mad rich I always thought I’d get a mil I ain’t never think about 3 or 4 now the money goin up now, up now
I put diamonds on my chest like I’m from up town
Say she tryna come around and let me fuck now
I had gave her my all only to get let down, only to get let down

[Verse 1: lil baby]

I got money in my account I’ll probably never spend
I gotta win win, for my kids kids
I got a new Benz, worth 300
But I had signed a deal for some shit you wouldn’t believe
I got needs, family in need
Switching dos and donts
Show em right from wrong
Give em money everytime they ask know I got a lecture for they ass
Know that imma be there when it count
I don’t write checks that bounce
I don’t write checks at all
Cash on all my cards, irs can get there’s don’t give a damn who care
Niggas got m’s everywhere
I’m just trying to stay on top confidence I’m never gone flaw
People having hate in they heart I can hear it when they talk
Know they talk bad when I ain’t around never let the fame tear me down (yeah) they tryna make me something I’m not
Never let em trick me out my spot
Kept it real with all my fans and now I’m large
Kept it real with all my niggas from the start this ain’t no new beginning
Thousand dollars on denim we finally winning im thanking god
I got the squad with me, I got the squad with me

[Chorus: lil baby]

4 by 4 trucks, pull up big as fuck
I ain’t never had shit
Now a nigga mad rich I always thought I’d get a mil I ain’t never think about 3 or 4 now the money goin up now, up now
I put diamonds on my teeth like I’m from up town
Say she tryna come around and let me fuck now
I had gave her my all only to get let down, only to get let down

[Verse 2: Lil Jairmy]

Way I’m running with that sack my score a touchdown
And when I comeback with that pack gone buy a bustdowd
Fucked around and nutted quick
I told told that bitch I’m in a rush now
The game is chess and it ain’t checkers you gotta make it count
And if you playing with that sack they might take you out
I’m smoking strong back to back this shit gone make you cough
I had to stay down with my hustle that shit made a boss
These niggas hate and they full of envy and they say Jairmy soft
Told my dawg I’d cut off my tounge before I ever talk
Niggas tryna cross us out, feds posted by the house
Selling pounds don’t sell no ounce
Molo don’t you ever doubt me
Baby let me tell em now
Niggas rich as ever now

[Chorus: lil baby]

4 by 4 trucks, pull up big as fuck
I ain’t never had shit
Now a nigga mad rich I always thought I’d get a mil I ain’t never think about 3 or 4 now the money goin up now, up now
I put diamonds on my chest like I’m from up town
Say she tryna come around and let me fuck now
I had gave her my all only to get let down, only to get let down
