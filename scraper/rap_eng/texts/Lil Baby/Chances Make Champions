[Intro: Lil Jairmy]
DJ Swift on the track
Chances makes champions
Chances makes champions
(I get the rubber bands then I break 'em)
Chances makes champions
(I get the rubber bands then I burn 'em, ooo)

[Chorus: Lil Jairmy]
I make the rubber bands then I break 'em
Rich shooter know not to play with them guns
I just keep constantly takin' these drugs
Couldn't beat the case so I went on the run
Chances make champions so I gotta take 'em
When I broke they weren't showin' me love
Back in and on the run
Now these bitches treat the kid like a Don
Hit that work on while chasin' that paper
Robbin', killin', niggas sellin' these drugs
Dirty soda, baby I drink on mud
This for the killers and trappers and thugs (Ooo)
Real VS, we ain't doin' no fakin' (No)
Bitches takin' pictures askin' for hugs
Wherever I go know I'm bringin' my gun
I ain't gotta pay 'em to keep the love

[Post-Chorus: Lil Jairmy]
(Chances makes champions)
I get the rubber bands then I break 'em (Ooo, ooo, ooo)
(Chances makes champions)
I get the rubber bands then I break 'em (Ooo)
Chances makes champions so I gotta take 'em (Ooo, ooo, ooo)
(Chances makes champions)
I get the rubber bands then I break 'em
(Chances makes champions)
I get the rubber bands then I break 'em
(Chances makes champions)
I get the rubber bands then I break 'em
Chances makes champions so I gotta take 'em (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Lil Jairmy]
Get the money, put this shit in the tub
Man, wake up and go spend a dub
I just be spendin' my profit on guns
I just came home and my dog on the run
[?] sent me 50, add it all up
I still remember I couldn't make bond
Water diamond got me clean like some dug
Lately baby I've been fly like a dub
If you owe me you can pay me in drugs
Police watchin' but we don't give a fuck
If I see a opp then I'm hittin' 'em up
I dropped the top pullin' up at the club
Glock cocked, I got 32 slugs
2Pac, bitch I look like a thug
God blessin', he gon' need a quran
'Nother lick, that's what I need then I'm done
Young nigga, I done been through the storm
I cheat on my ho and I don't feel even sorry
Niggas cappin', talkin' 'bout they gon' rob me
Cordin' on milly, you blessin' like Carti
I got a strap on me while I'm recordin'
I'm rockin' Red bottoms like their Jordan's
Stack them blue hunnids up, make 'em look gorgeous
All these losses could've whip out the 'Rari, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
(Yeah)
Stretch them rubber bands all 'til they break
Try to rob me, he get shot in the face
All these losses could've bought me a wraith
Fuck a cousin, nigga started from nothin'
13, fell in love with a gun
Ran up 3 mil' in 24 months
We can talk about a hell of a run
Throw away Dracos with the cops
Blew out lights and then we smash on the cars
Ain't met a bitch who won't let me smash in the car
Lil' homie killed himself playin' with a boss
So we don't play with [?] unless you drug talkin'
I ain't get involved until it's kill talk
I work too hard, I'ma real Don
I know top shooters doin' real time
I got real drugs, don't need no stunting
They gon' run it high when they get [?]
You know I see them hit, I'm on the front line
If you hold me then I won't mind
I had some loyalty's, I paid them all
If I had a problem, would've knocked 'em off
I can make 20 racks and break the safe
I show these youngin's how to be a boss

[Chorus: Lil Jairmy]
I make the rubber bands then I break 'em
Rich shooter know not to play with them guns
I just keep constantly takin' these drugs
Couldn't beat the case so I went on the run
Chances make champions so I gotta take 'em
When I broke they weren't showin' me love
Back in and on the run
Now these bitches treat the kid like a Don
Hit that work on while chasin' that paper
Robbin', killin', niggas sellin' these drugs
Dirty soda, baby I drink on mud
This for the killers and trappers and thugs (Ooo)
Real VS, we ain't doin' no fakin' (No)
Bitches takin' pictures askin' for hugs
Wherever I go know I'm bringin' my gun
I ain't gotta pay 'em to keep the love

[Post-Chorus: Lil Jairmy]
(Chances makes champions)
I get the rubber bands then I break 'em (Ooo)
(Chances makes champions)
I get the rubber bands then I break 'em (Ooo)
Chances makes champions so I gotta take 'em (Ooo, ooo, ooo)
(Chances makes champions)
I get the rubber bands then I break 'em (Ooo, ooo, ooo)
(Chances makes champions)
I get the rubber bands then I break 'em
(Chances makes champions)
I get the rubber bands then I break 'em
Chances makes champions so I gotta take 'em (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
