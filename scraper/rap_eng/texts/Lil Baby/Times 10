[Intro]
It's like a breath of Fresh Ayr
DJ Pain 1

[Verse 1: Sammie]
You got the sauce girl, I cannot forget
As I lay in my bed girl, I think about it
You got that ocean, that’s wet everywhere
That's why I keep surfin' you
Licking you baby, no curving you
You got that eyes that keep me on my toes
When you freakin’ me baby girl, anything goes
When you go down, I know you care and it shows
I'll return the favor, baby, times ten
Imma keep you cummin', cummin' again
Again

[Bridge]
Oh, again
Keep you cummin', keep you cummin' again
Oh, oh
I'll return the favor baby, times ten
Imma keep you cummin', cummin’ again
Again

[Verse 2]
Whenever you fuck me, I feel like I’m high
When you get on top, you can enjoy the ride
Girl, I'm just happy to be all inside you
I been on the road, so let me remind you
I’ma real life freak, we can fuck up my sheets, Imma dive in deep, I'm horny
When I slide in you, you confide in me, it's yours, baby ride this pony
I'm talking pretty brown, brown, driving me wild
Yeah
Imma keep you cummin’ again

[Chorus x 2]
Keep you cummin', oh
Keep you cummin' again
Keep you cummin', keep you cummin' again
Keep you cummin', oh
Keep you cummin'
I'll return the favor, baby, times ten
Imma keep you cummin', cummin' again
Again

[Bridge]
Oh, again
Keep you cummin', keep you cummin' again
Oh, oh
I'll return the favor, baby, times ten
Imma keep you cummin', cummin' again
Again

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Cummin', and cummin' again, that pussy so good, I tell all your friends
Why they keep on trying? I won't let 'em in, why you keep on crying? I bought you a Benz
She fuck where we live, my type like skin
Upgrade your world, everything times ten
I dropped demons, tryna run from my sin
Need a rider in this life that I'm in
Hope that this feeling's contagious, it got me feeling amazing, we only fuck on occasion
It won't be much to replace you
VVS ones, I done laced you, I should've played you
I'm always playing it cool, thinking 'bout times that we had
Wish I could take 'em all back, can't sit around and be mad
I gotta keep getting cash, oh

[Chorus x 2]
Keep you cummin', oh
Keep you cummin' again
Keep you cummin', keep you cummin' again
Keep you cummin', oh
Keep you cummin'
I'll return the favor, baby, times ten
Imma keep you cummin', cummin' again
Again

[Outro]
Oh, again
Keep you cummin', keep you cummin' again
Oh, oh
I'll return the favor, baby, times ten
Imma keep you cummin', cummin' again
Again
