[Intro: TK Kravitz]
Cook that shit up, Quay
TK Kravitz
2 The Hard Way
Marlo, Lil Baby
Let 'em know

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
You might say that you love me, but I know that you lyin'
But I'm fuckin' with you, yeah
You done crossed me one time and I took you back time after time, oh yeah
Time after time, time after time after time, oh yeah
I swear it's time after time, time after time after time, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Here we go again, listenin' to your friends
They ain't the one sleeping with me, they ain't got that new Benz
Know you probably tired of my lies
Know you probably think that you can find another guy but not this fly
I'm like why you listen to that bullshit that they put in your ear?
I'm the same one that dropped a dub and put it in your ear
He say she say every other day, I know you tired of it
Just be honest, you knew what it was when you signed up
I can't 'pologize enough
This what we gon' do, just get my things and pack 'em up
I'm so through with you, I don't know what to do
Probably lose my cool
I can't see me in no prison, I got shit to lose

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
You might say that you love me, but I know that you lyin'
But I'm fuckin' with you, yeah
You done crossed me one time and I took you back time after time, oh yeah
Time after time, time after time after time, oh yeah
I swear it's time after time, time after time after time, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Marlo]
You keep startin' this bullshit, so I'ma let you go
Fuck it, find another ho, I got a bitch to play your role
And you keep telling me that you really love me
You put no one above me
And I know you're in your feelings
I know you caught me down bad, I was trippin'
I was caught up in the hype, fuckin' bitches
Bae do I ever come up in your dreams?
When I'm buying you all these fuckin' designer things
And I'm giving you the world on everything
And it's me and you against the world, bae you dog
Back to back in them halls
You shittin' on bitches, fuck the law
And I know you get tired of them lies, I can see it in your eyes, yeah
I know you really fuckin' with me

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
You might say that you love me, but I know that you lyin'
But I'm fuckin' with you, yeah
You done crossed me one time and I took you back time after time, oh yeah
Time after time, time after time after time, oh yeah
I swear it's time after time, time after time after time, oh yeah
