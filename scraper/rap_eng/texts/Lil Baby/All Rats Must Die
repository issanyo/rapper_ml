Intro:
Right In His Eyes "Oh Yea" , They'll Never Fly
"(Laugh)" I Got Baby With Me This Time, All Rats Must Die
This That Or Die S**t

Hook:
Still trap At the same spot
Still flexing that Same knot
They ain’t having no plays , these n***as Be played out
My case got dead doc, Stick came wit ah red dot
We don't give out legs shot, Run Down Get head shot

All Rats Must Die
I came to kill I'm trying to look death in his eyes
These h**s be birds cut of they wings they’ll never fly
Got it locked like dread lock's
Stick cams wit ah real dot
Rat n***as get head shots


Verse:
Screaming Free Lil Bird , YK4L We The Purge , That Check On me Just like the 1st /
I swear it's ah gift and A Curse , these Verses belong in a church
You snitch you belong in a Hurst /
I'm A diamond that had rose from the dirt , 100 round drum on that stick like nerf /
H** call me papa no Smurf , They left Me for better or worst
Pain in my heart and it hurting /
Still keep it moving I'm having the motions ,Cop me Audi soon as I get noticed /
You was interrogated and you fold , I'm steady balling on like scrotum /
They never stop me, ain't been cocky , These head shot ..... ion no body/
N***as ain't hot they just Takis , They ain’t having no deposits/
I’m wit Lil baby and we in The S.W.A.T.S , cuffing my main and swapping these thots /
4 Different pockets that's 4 different knots , It’s hard to lost count when you count it a lot /
Melt like ice when you seen that fye , rats get no love All rats must die /
Yea Im still on dat block , 1100 block , Simpson road 4 Life I'll Never Switch Sides /

Verse 2:
Look At Me I Got My City Hot
We Shoot Up Top We Don't Aim For Leg Shots
Been Toting Glocks Since Mac Had Dread Locks
He Such & Such I Heard The I Feds Got Em
I Need FreeBarz "D.i." These Deads Got Me
Remember Us Thuggin Back And Fourth I'm The Truth Now
& It's Crazy We Done Took Off We Making Moves Now
Remember Beefing At All Them Parks But We Cooler Now
Remember Going To The Detour With My Only $1000
