[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Heh! It's Gucci (Guwop)
Shoutout my partner Khao, man (Yeah, heh!)
Hey, he back at it (Burr)
Mathematics, heh, ha
Le'ts go, go (Hey!)

[Chorus: Tabius Tate & Gucci Mane]
I just put the roof in the trunk so they lookin', yeah (Woo!)
Khao did the beat so they motherfuckin' crippin', dawg (Hey!)
Gave you niggas style like a boss so you drippin' (Woo!)
I ain't trippin', I just had to introduce you to the deal, that's right (Let's go, hey)
You can't have your chick until I'm done with her (What?)
I just hit the club and have fun with her (Let's get it)
You can't have your chick until I'm done with her (Hey!)
I just hit the club and have fun with her (Gucci!)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Big Guwop and I ain't playin' with people (No)
All my goons carrying straps everyday like it's legal (Brrah)
Keep a bowl with the dope, I used to stay with the Eagle (Pow pow)
Robin Hood of the 6, I'm a genius but evil (Heh)
Plus the coupe sit low and the plane from Tokyo (Wop)
All these Spyders, she got scared, got arachnophobia (Damn)
I'm the shit from Zone 6 back to Ethiopia (Huh)
All these diamond bracelets on me gave my wrist pneumonia (Bling)
All my shooters posing smokin', gas loud as ammonia
All these designer privates got these women glass and they on us (S'Gucci)
I can call right now and make you come if I wanna (Go)
I'm a plug when I wanna (Heh), stretch two lows 'round the corner (Wop)

[Chorus: Tabius Tate & Lil Baby]

Ain't get no job, if it get hard then we gon' rob, yeah
We ain't gon' starve, that ain't no motherfuckin' option (Hey!)
Different car, different broad, I got options (Options, hey!)
Got my phone on the charge, 'cause I'm poppin' (Woo!)
Standin' on stage with racks in my pants, you niggas done stand too close
Gun in my pants, this shit ain't legit, a nigga don't care no more (Hey!)
Yeah, my dawg caught a body, his face on the news, now he going on the run
All the niggas smoke big blunts, if you wanna smoke get down (Hey!)
Diamonds my hands shine bright, I'm too rich to get into a fight
I just wanna fuck her for a night, tell her off and send her on a flight
Amiri jean, denim fit tight, double seat, so I walk light
V12, S 65, pulled up, killed 'em on sight (Hey!)

[Chorus: Tabius Tate & YBH Nahmir]
I just put the roof in the trunk so they lookin', yeah (Woo!)

[Verse 3: YBN Nahmir]
Racks (Woo), I love the way it stacks
Hundred bands times two 'cause you know I double that
You know we the trendsetters and these niggas copycats
Grind the pole, get in that motion, 'cause you know we into that
Gucci on my shoes (Hey), my belt, that's above my waistline
Every time I send that heat it make a youngin' wanna slide
Diamonds cost 'bout fifty bands and I did not rent mine
Before my niggas in the struggle, on the gang, it's alright
Ayy, still the same nigga (Ayy), humble, never changed nigga
Rusty bang with us (Ayy), if a nigga lame, nigga
Catch a opp', I'm staining them (Ayy), since he wanna play with us
I really changed nigga (Ayy), was down bad with K's, nigga (Let's go)

[Chorus: Tabius Tate]
I just put the roof in the trunk so they lookin', yeah (Woo!)
Khao did the beat so they motherfuckin' crippin', dawg (Hey!)
Gave you niggas style like a boss so you drippin' (Woo!)
I ain't trippin', I just had to introduce you to the deal, that's right (Let's go, hey)
You can't have your chick until I'm done with her (What?)
I just hit the club and have fun with her (Let's get it)
You can't have your chick until I'm done with her (Hey!)
I just hit the club and have fun with her
