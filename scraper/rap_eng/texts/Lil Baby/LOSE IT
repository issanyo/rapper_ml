[Chorus: Quavo]
Yeah, she lookin' like a movie, yeah (Woo, bad, yeah)
I think that I'ma choose her, yeah (Choose her, hoo, yeah)
Back that ass up, no Juvie, yeah (Juvie, hoo, yeah)
Throw them racks, go stupid, yeah (Racks, stupid, yeah)
Squeeze my shot like Uzis, yeah (Shoot, Uzi, yeah)
When I slide on her, yeah (Skrrt, slide, yeah)
Heard she wet, Jacuzzi, yeah (Splash, wet, yeah)
Make me go, make me go, make me go lose it (Go, lose it)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Bought her Chanel, surprise on her, yeah (Chanel, yeah)
She so bad, got girls and guys on her (Yeah)
Make me wanna pull out the phone and go live on her, yeah (Yeah)
But I snap back and close my eyes on her (Damn, yeah)
Bad bitch, she bring a team of girls (Damn, yeah)
They all came back after the club (Woo, yeah)
Every city I go, they show me love (Show, yeah)
That's because we (What?) real thugs (Yeah)
Bet that ice make her drown in the tub (Ice)
Say she got that bag, told her put down on the drugs (Bag)
That the type of shit that make your nigga call in (Brr, woo)
That the type of shit that make your nigga fall in love (Woo)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Pull up, I'm the life of the party
4x4 truck sittin' on Forgis
488 with a 8, that's Yachty
Lime Lamborghini sittin' pretty, that's Cardi
Blue Lamborghini Diablo, gon' Offset's
Havin' talks in the Wraith, 'bout to take off
Me and Pee in the Dawn havin' boss talks
Got the game from, bruh, that's where I walk
What am I gonna do when all these girls
In the city goin' crazy over me?
Take the tints off the car so they can see me
Slick, intimidatin', niggas wanna be me
PJ when we creepin', they won't ever see me
Ain't too into cameras, but they got to see me
Diamonds on my fingers, I'm a superstar
All in there like sneakin' with a superstar
Hit me if you want, I'm not gonna make a call
Marlo's still trappin' in them trap house
Cartier, solitaire, golf ball
Real big dog, I won't fuck with y'all
Made it to the charts, they know who I am
Shout out to my fans, really fuck with y'all
Internet beef, I won't get involved
If it's real problems, then it's gettin' solved
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Quavo]
Yeah, she lookin' like a movie, yeah (Woo, bad, yeah)
I think that I'ma choose her, yeah (Choose her, hoo, yeah)
Back that ass up, no Juvie, yeah (Juvie, hoo, yeah)
Throw them racks, go stupid, yeah (Racks, stupid, yeah)
Squeeze my shot like Uzis, yeah (Shoot, Uzi, yeah)
When I slide on her, yeah (Skrrt, slide, yeah)
Heard she wet, Jacuzzi, yeah (Splash, wet, yeah)
Make me go, make me go, make me go lose it

[Verse 3: Quavo]
When I say (Lose it)
She gonna make a nigga lose it
I'm talkin' big money
Big money, thumb throughin' it (Hey)
Not through with it (Nah, nah)
Not through with it (Nah)
She all on the phone with her last nigga
Say that pussy is mine, he losin' it (Brrt, yeah)
She poppin' it, I'm ownin' it (Yeah)
She droppin' it, it's stoppin' it (Stop), lose it (Yeah)
Out of control, she movin' it (Ooh, yeah)
It's movin' (Woo)
It's a movie (Woo)
She walkin' around in Nike leggings (Ooh, yeah)
Just doin' it (Go!)
Don't get involved with her besties, they messy
Spent a fifty ball on her neckpiece, she flexing
I don't give no calls, I just hit her with the texting
Emoji all drippin', leakin' waterfalls, yeah
