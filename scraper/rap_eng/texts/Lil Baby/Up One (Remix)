Never let a bitch nigga take my shine
Fuck waitin' around nigga, I'ma take mine
I'm up one now but it took a little time
Patek Philippe for my time
Free lil bro, he brought the MAC's out
Standin' on stage with my strap out
Everywhere I go I got them racks out
Nigga try to take mine, it's a blackout
I'm gettin' money for real, I had a mil, before the deal, yeah
I get them pounds every week, I'm never off beat, I stay in the streets, yeah
Niggas be sayin' they want beef, but soon as we meet, they want to speak, yeah
Count this money 'til I fall off
I'm LeBron the way I ball out
Niggas run and hide when them rods out
Man that shit wasn't sweet, I took the hard route
I'm in Dallas, I got all my chains on
She keep callin' my line so I changed phones
Hop out, who you? Who you? Bruh, shoot
Run with the gang, we gon' pull up in groups
Get you knocked down for a new pair of shoes
