[Intro]
Al Geno on the track
Niggas having undercover pressure 'bout bitches
Let a nigga know if it’s smoke

[Verse 1]
I was sittin' in jail, I was in penitentiary
I done seen the gangsta niggas turn bitches
I'ma answer calls, I don’t like bitches
She'll still pull up on a nigga and kick it
I ain't gon' lie, we talked about this
I always knew that I would be rich
Shawty, she cry like I'm buyin' tears
She done kept it gangsta all these years
Used to write the bitch, she ain't write back
Now I'm on top, she don’t like that
I don’t think about it, had to let 'em know that
She can die tomorrow, I prolly wouldn’t notice
Try to hold me down, I gotta stay focused
Go and get the money, bust the safe open
Stay away from broads, I gotta stay low
Rest in peace my dawg, he got a halo (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Play with me, you gon' get chastised
Free the bros down the road doin' real time
All the homies, they call it the red line
He gon' only pull up when they say it’s time
Play with me, you gon' get chastised
Free the bros down the road doin' real time
All the homies, they call it the red line
He gon' only pull up when they say it's time

[Verse 2]
Ain't got no patience for bullshit
I kill 'em all dead, ain't gone play with nobody
Lil' homie thuggin', he 13
Like a slim bitch, he just want him a body
No one went to the league, but we all ball
Make sure everyone eat, I don't ball hog
Swear it's somethin' 'bout the hood that make my heart beat
Do a show and fly right back to spark street
Been dead broke, that's what scarred me
Watchin' niggas hustle, that's what taught me
They was tryna leave me by the garbage
Now they callin', "Meet me, I'm a target"
Do it for 'em, make 'em feel important
Knowin' damn well I should've ignored it
I buy what I want, I can afford it
Lot of money, I want more of it

[Chorus]
Play with me, you gon' get chastised
Free the bros down the road doin' real time
All the homies, they call it the red line
He gon' only pull up when they say it's time
Play with me, you gon' get chastised
Free the bros down the road doin' real time
All the homies, they call it the red line
He gon' only pull up when they say it's time
