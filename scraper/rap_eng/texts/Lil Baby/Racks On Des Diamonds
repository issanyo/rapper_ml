[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'm in the trenches, I'm gettin' this money, I need me a hood bitch
I don't be flexin', I really be poppin', they know that I'm hood rich
Hundred bricks came from Pablo, Gunna rollin' up gelato
Hope a nigga don't try me, they gon' find a nigga body
I spent some racks on these diamonds
I spent some racks on these diamonds
I spent some racks on these diamonds
Hope a nigga don't try me
I spent some racks on these diamonds
I spent some racks on these diamonds
I spent some racks on these diamonds
Hope a nigga don't try me

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Hundred bricks in a duffel bag, got 'em from Pablo
Gunna still all in the cut, rollin' gelato
Nigga try me, it ain't a move
Bet a nigga make the news
Fox Five, channel two
I ain't trippin', you a fool
I just bought some new V-lone
Moschino on my back, Moschino on my swag, Moschino on my belt
I been feelin' myself, I done tripled my wealth
Starring nobody else, did this shit by myself
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Remember them days a nigga was broke, now we gettin' to the money
Them niggas was hating, them niggas be hating, I think that shit funny, yeah
A nigga better not try me, it's gon' be a fuckin' homi
All my young niggas gunning, nigga it ain't no running

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'm in the trenches, I'm gettin' this money, I need me a hood bitch
I don't be flexin', I really be poppin', they know that I'm hood rich
Hundred bricks came from Pablo, Gunna rollin' up gelato
Hope a nigga don't try me, they gon' find a nigga body
I spent some racks on these diamonds
I spent some racks on these diamonds
I spent some racks on these diamonds
Hope a nigga don't try me
I spent some racks on these diamonds
I spent some racks on these diamonds
I spent some racks on these diamonds
Hope a nigga don't try me

[Verse 2: HoodRich Pablo Juan]
Young nigga, I be flexin' and poppin'
Me and Lil Baby the plug and the socket
Homicide, ready to catch a body
Trap profit got me all four pockets
I spent some racks on these diamonds
Like a whole hundred thousand
Ten pints, I drink gallons
I dress like I'm going to Jimmy Fallon
Don't give a fuck, we gon' fuck that shit up
Drop off a bale in a pickup truck
Givenchys are very particular
Flooded diamonds, it got princess cut
Bend her over, down set hut
Fuckin' that ho, put my thumb in her butt
We fuckin' that shit up, that ain't nothin' to us
We fuckin' that shit up, that ain't nothin' to us

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'm in the trenches, I'm gettin' this money, I need me a hood bitch
I don't be flexin', I really be poppin', they know that I'm hood rich
Hundred bricks came from Pablo, Gunna rollin' up gelato
Hope a nigga don't try me, they gon' find a nigga body
I spent some racks on these diamonds
I spent some racks on these diamonds
I spent some racks on these diamonds
Hope a nigga don't try me
I spent some racks on these diamonds
I spent some racks on these diamonds
I spent some racks on these diamonds
Hope a nigga don't try me
