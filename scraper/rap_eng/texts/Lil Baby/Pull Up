[Chorus: Kap G]
Pull up in brand new whip
Pull up, I park in the VIP
I pull up, I park in the VIP
Pull up in brand new whip
She pull up in brand new whip
She pull up, she matchin' my drip
She pull up then I gotta dip
She pull up to give me them chips
Hope you 'bout that action when I pull up
Go'n with all that capping, she gon' pull up
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know

[Verse 1: Kap G]
I go to war for this shit, I go to war for this shit
She on the floor for this shit, I feel like Floyd in this bitch
Them bitches be talking, they mad that you poppin'
Yeah we do the most
You know how we rockin', more money, more problems
Yeah we want some more, yeah
Lil shawty down to ride
We like Bonnie and Clyde
Lil shawty my type
Let them know when I ride
Pussy wet I'ma dive
Got me feeling so alive
Lil shawty my woe
Lil shawty go bye
I just really want both
I just really want dos
Met lil shawty on the coast
She gon' pull up in a Ghost
Double R's you can see the stars when she valet at the W
Baby I'm a dog, yeah I swear to god
I ain't goin' raw when I'm fuckin' you

[Chorus: Kap G]
Pull up in brand new whip
Pull up, I park in the VIP
I pull up, I park in the VIP
Pull up in brand new whip
She pull up in brand new whip
She pull up, she matchin' my drip
She pull up then I gotta dip
She pull up to give me them chips
Hope you 'bout that action when I pull up
Go'n with all that capping, she gon' pull up
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Straight out the mud with this shit
Pull up in brand new whip
Shawty she fuck with my pimpin'
She know Lil Baby got drip
F&N right on my hip
She keep three eighty on her
You know my baby no square
She gon' stay down when it's real
All my pockets full, all my pockets full
You can see the way they pokin' (I'm loaded)
All these diamonds froze, all this water on me
Got me feeling like the ocean
Bought the Jag truck just to match up
Put three hundred thousand on the road
Ever since a nigga ran it back up
Why these hoes treat me like I'm gold
Can't fuck with no snitches 'cause they can't get close to me
No Future and Scooter but I know she notice me
And she gon' pull up, yeah wherever I tell her
Niggas holdin' and they don't even know me
'Cause fuck your baby daddy, he ain't got no money
I nut in her face so she see how I'm comin'

[Chorus: Kap G]
Pull up in brand new whip
Pull up, I park in the VIP
I pull up, I park in the VIP
Pull up in brand new whip
She pull up in brand new whip
She pull up, she matchin' my drip
She pull up then I gotta dip
She pull up to give me them chips
