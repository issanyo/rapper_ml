[Intro: Lil Baby]
Cook that shit up, Quay
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, alright alright

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
All I needed was a chance, all I needed was a chance
Show the world who I am
All I needed was a chance, all I needed was a chance
Watch me run me up them bands
All I needed was a chance, all I needed was a chance
Get this ball on the roll
All I needed was a chance, all I needed was a chance
Watch me run me up them bands, all I needed was a chance

[Verse 1: Kollision]
I know [?] need me, yeah
Know my three need me, know my mama need me, yeah
Know my uncle need me, I know Kylan need me
I know DJ need me, yeah
So if I fuck with you I'm solid to the core
J-Pay and Green Dots, when they call I don't ignore
Hard work, now I got what I deserve
When they counted me out, I did not [?]
I waited my turn
Had a couple bitches that deceived me
Couple partners stayed down, believed in me
I took the world in my palm, yeah yeah
I had to even out my odds, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
All I needed was a chance, all I needed was a chance
Show the world who I am
All I needed was a chance, all I needed was a chance
Watch me run me up them bands
All I needed was a chance, all I needed was a chance
Get this ball on the roll
All I needed was a chance, all I needed was a chance
Watch me run me up them bands, all I needed was a chance

[Verse 2: Marlo]
All I needed was a chance, thank god I'm the man
I'll never sell my soul for them bands
Thank god for my mans, he helped me get up out the jam
So when he came home told him I got him
And a couple niggas switched up
Well good well, nigga good luck
I push work, no push up
And I went up with no sit up
And I still drop down to my knees and thank god for this chance
I switched over to the rap, now I advance
I told him give me half a mil for my advance
I put a whole hundred pounds in that van
Took over, now I'm the man
Hey, check that last bag
I think the shit was over a whole couple bands

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
All I needed was a chance, all I needed was a chance
Show the world who I am
All I needed was a chance, all I needed was a chance
Watch me run me up them bands
All I needed was a chance, all I needed was a chance
Get this ball on the roll
All I needed was a chance, all I needed was a chance
Watch me run me up them bands, all I needed was a chance
