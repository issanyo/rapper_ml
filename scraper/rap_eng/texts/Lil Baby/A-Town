[Chorus: Lil Baby & Marlo]
A-T-L-A-N-T-A-G-A, that's where I'm from
I'm from the slums, niggas knowin' how we come
A-T-L-A-N-T-A-G-A, that's where I'm from
I'm from the bricks where we ain't have shit
This that real A-Town, yeah this that real A-Town
This that real A-Town, yeah this that real A-Town

[Verse 1: Lil Baby & Marlo]
Back when G-Dog caught his time 'cause he wouldn't drop a dime
Back when Big Fred died, had the whole hood cryin'
OG Troup lost his life in his own hood
Niggas steady walkin' 'round like it's all good
Tiger T got crossed by his own man
I seen him and 8-Ball count a hundred bands
Remember Spencer killed a nigga with his bare hand
Meatball turned rat on his own fam
Him and Jordan lil' one got killed at the same time
Every time I close my eyes that shit on my mind
What you know about doin' a paper for some paper
You niggas can't relate 'cause you ain't never ran around in that

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Marlo]
A-T-L-A-N-T-A-G-A, that's where I'm from
I'm from the slums, niggas knowin' how we come
A-T-L-A-N-T-A-G-A, that's where I'm from
I'm from the bricks where we ain't have shit
This that real A-Town, yeah this that real A-Town
This that real A-Town, yeah this that real A-Town

[Verse 2: Lil Baby & Marlo]
Rest in peace to Shawty Lo, yeah dey know
Back when he was comin' through the bricks in an orange Monte Carlo
Mario got shot, that's still some bullshit
Remember NuNu got hit with a whole clip
You niggas ain't from my side, they must be two-sided
They sayin' C-Dog turned in the whole west side
You niggas never was there
I remember neighborhood fights all at the fair
When micros was the only thing that girls would wear
Then these bitches started puttin' the kink and twist in their hair
True Religion was the shit, hood days spend your last on an outfit
They say Keen and Big been rich

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Marlo]
A-T-L-A-N-T-A-G-A, that's where I'm from
I'm from the slums, niggas knowin' how we come
A-T-L-A-N-T-A-G-A, that's where I'm from
I'm from the bricks where we ain't have shit
This that real A-Town, yeah this that real A-Town
This that real A-Town, yeah this that real A-Town
