[Intro: Drako]
You know it's Lil Voe on the beat
I was so far on the bottom (Bottom)
Nigga couldn't even see the top (Top)
Now I'm so motherfuckin' up (Up)
I'm afraid to fuckin' drop (Drop)
Woo (Woo), woo (Woo), I'm afraid to fuckin' stop (Stop)
Woo (Woo), woo (Woo), woo, yeah

[Chorus: Drako]
Money all in these Balmains (Balmains)
I got all of these racks on me (Racks)
I can afford to blow a bag (Blow it)
I got all of these racks on me (Racks)
I can run it up and fuck it up (Fuck it up)
I got all of these racks on me (Racks)
I just cheated on my main bitch (Main bitch)
But my side comin' back to me

[Verse 1: Drako]
I'm ballin' on these broke niggas (Swish)
Check the highlights on SportsCenter (Get it)
I'm Michael Jordan on the court, nigga (23)
Scottie Pippen, that's my lil' nigga (33)
Shoot the three like Reggie Miller (Reggie)
Sellin' cookies by the pound, nigga (Yeah)
Smoke the gas by the ounce, nigga (Dirty)
Roll it up and burn it down, nigga (Woo)
I'm gettin' head in a private flight (Suck it up)
I might just fly to Dubai tonight
I might fly to Tokyo tomorrow
Just to drift in a foreign car (Skrrt skrrt)
I'm on them bars and I'm dozin' off (Sleepin')
I had to wake up and count it up (Count it up)
When the money call, pick it up (Hello?)
If it ain't 'bout money, bitch I'm hangin' up (Fuck it)
Broke niggas get the dial tone (Rah)
Thot hoes get wild on (Bah)
Got a quarter million worth of jewelry on me (Ice)
Lookin' like I got headlights on me (Woo)
I'm in that Demon, no Hellcat
And I done made it through hell and back (I did)
Now a young nigga got hella racks (I do)
And I fuck on your bitch for the hell of it (Ugh, ugh)

[Chorus: Drako]
Money all in these Balmains (Balmains)
I got all of these racks on me (Racks)
I can afford to blow a bag (Blow it)
I got all of these racks on me (Racks)
I can run it up and fuck it up (Fuck it up)
I got all of these racks on me (Racks)
I just cheated on my main bitch (Main bitch)
But my side comin' back to me

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Givinchy, Givenchy, whatever you call it (Call it)
Drip down to my sizzocks (Sizzocks)
Somebody left on the faucet (Drip)
We gon' shop, we don't drip out the closet (Closet)
No withdrawals, only makin' deposits ('Posits)
I'ma run to the money like Forrest (Forrest)
Hit the lot, I'ma buy me a foreign (Skrrt)
I done got big on 'em, feelin' important ('Portant)
Pockets fat like Rasputia from Norbit (Norbit)
I took flight to the top, now I'm soarin' (Soarin')
I might buy me a car when I'm bored (Bored)
I'ma buy everything I couldn't afford
I'm ballin' on niggas who keepin' the score (Score)
I don't give a damn about gettin' rewards (Rewards)
I'ma make sure that I put up the point
They didn't believe when I said I'm the one
Put up a twenty a month for my son
Fight like a man, we gon' shoot, we don't run (Fire)
I let the bros hit the road with a gun (Gun), yeah
Whole lotta racks on me
She mad 'cause she can't get a piece
All a nigga wear Amiri jeans
And a nigga livin' out his dreams

[Chorus: Drako]
Money all in these Balmains (Balmains)
I got all of these racks on me (Racks)
I can afford to blow a bag (Blow it)
I got all of these racks on me (Racks)
I can run it up and fuck it up (Fuck it up)
I got all of these racks on me (Racks)
I just cheated on my main bitch (Main bitch)
But my side comin' back to me

[Verse 3: Drako]
I got a fetish for horses (I do)
Polos and Ferraris (Skrrt)
And I just copped an Aston Martin (I did it)
Push button, I can start it (Beep beep)
I ain't even gotta park it
Swear I'm goin' dumb, retarded (I am)
Swear I'm goin' HAM in the trap (I am)
Serve a nigga brick with the strap (Ah)
Finesse his ass, no cap (No cap)
Water diamonds, no tap (No tap)
They know that I'm paid
They know that I'm good
They know that I'm straight (I'm straight)
I'm cookin' an eight, uh
I'm boomin' a spot and I'm workin' the base (I'm beatin')
The racks in the safe (They is)
The steak on my plate, I'm on my way (They eatin')

[Chorus: Drako]
Money all in these Balmains (Balmains)
I got all of these racks on me (Racks)
I can afford to blow a bag (Blow it)
I got all of these racks on me (Racks)
I can run it up and fuck it up (Fuck it up)
I got all of these racks on me (Racks)
I just cheated on my main bitch (Main bitch)
But my side comin' back to me
