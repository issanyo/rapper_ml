[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Money was my first, we started fuckin' in elementary
We been gettin' it for a minute, finger fuckin' for a century
Fell in love with these drugs, I'm so high up
We got guns full of cheepo, they don't try us
They was callin', I was ballin', I ain't answer, ain't get no serves
I ain't never punch no clock, ain't have no job, I'm always workin'
I was servin', it took some time
But now I'm perfect, on that block
I was up early, gettin' faded, poppin' Percies, sippin' syrup
I'm prolly swervin', keep my pills 'cause I be nervous
I remember when we was just lurkin'
Can't go broke, I'm allergic
If you got the money, I'm servin'
It was always worth it

[Chorus: 1K]
Hey, first day out the county, huh
Stick to money, keep counting, huh
Money on head, that's bounty, huh
Nig can't even play round me
Gotta keep that fake shit from round me, yeah
I gotta keep that fake shit from round me
I'm too busy, been counting
Fake love, that be the worst love, hey
Hey, that money was my first love, yeah
Then I fell in love with all these drugs, yeah
Hey, I don't need no fake love, fake love be the worst love

[Verse 3: 1K]
Hey, these hoes love the money
