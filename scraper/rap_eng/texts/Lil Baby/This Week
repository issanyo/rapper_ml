[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay

[Chorus]
Pulled up sippin' on drank (Drank)
Told 'em that I quit but I can't (I can't)
I just ran through a whole pint (Whole pint)
Add a whole 'nother M in the bank this week
Hope a nigga don't think I'm sweet (I'm sweet)
Lil' homie graduate, buy him a new Jeep (New Jeep)
Everything mine, I don't rent it, I keep (I keep)
All kind of cars, nigga, check out my fleet
We ran them racks up in the basement, we ain't have no cable
Buy every bando on the dead end, we ain't got no neighbors
Disrespectful to a bitch, no manners, yeah
I was runnin' through bags on Campbellton
Told the streets I'm too hot, you can't handle this
I'ma lie to your honor, I'm scandalous

[Verse 1]
I'm rich, got caught with another nigga bitch
New G-Wagon, '18, no tints
Can't keep up with the money I spent
I don't keep count, I just know that I'm gettin' it
I be hearin' rumors they gon' take my chain
I ain't really trippin' if a young nigga get it
Hope you got insurance, nigga, you gon' die with it
Breaking news, guarantee we make a nigga feel it
We ran them racks up in the basement, we ain't have no cable
Buy every bando on the dead end, we ain't got no neighbors
We got the whole city on exotic, tell the plug to send all the flavors
I never went for extortion, you can't pay a nigga to tell you I paid him
Shout out the real ones who gettin' it, yeah
Ride 'round the city, no ceiling, yeah
I had to upgrade my living, yeah
Took me some time, but I did it, yeah
I'm balling, I stay on my pivot, yeah
Label me one of the real ones, yeah
I see 'em shootin' shots
Any one of 'em hit me, we killin' 'em dead

[Chorus]
Pulled up sippin' on drank (Drank)
Told 'em that I quit but I can't (I can't)
I just ran through a whole pint (Whole pint)
Add a whole 'nother M in the bank this week
Hope a nigga don't think I'm sweet (I'm sweet)
Lil' homie graduate, buy him a new Jeep (New Jeep)
Everything mine, I don't rent it, I keep (I keep)
All kind of cars, nigga, check out my fleet
We ran them racks up in the basement, we ain't have no cable
Buy every bando on the dead end, we ain't got no neighbors
Disrespectful to a bitch, no manners, yeah
I was runnin' through bags on Campbellton
Told the streets I'm too hot, you can't handle this
I'ma lie to your honor, I'm scandalous

[Verse 2]
I like how she watchin' me (Like how she watchin')
This jewelry on me goin' insane
I come from the poverty (Come from the poverty)
This money ain't makin' me change (Change)
Everything lit when we go up, yeah
Whole lot of four we throw up, yeah
My diamonds on fleek, they glow up, yeah
Everybody sip lean, pour up, yeah
All the PT's came from Cinco
Hope them folks don't hit me with the RICO
Still can make a call and get a kilo
Keep it real, you niggas know my steelo
Hold that thought, just keep that on the D-low
We don't pay no notes, don't go through re-po's
We gon' hit 'em up and make 'em repost
I became a neighborhood hero
Tryna listen to my conversation
Bank account a lot of puncutation
Told the plug ain't no more situations
Trap house rollin', Radric Davis (Oh God)
Pulled up sippin' on drank, yeah
Everywhere I go, big bank, yeah
Ain't never withdraw from the bank, yeah
Give a damn what a fuck nigga think, yeah

[Chorus]
Pulled up sippin' on drank (Drank)
Told 'em that I quit but I can't (I can't)
I just ran through a whole pint (Whole pint)
Add a whole 'nother M in the bank this week
Hope a nigga don't think I'm sweet (I'm sweet)
Lil' homie graduate, buy him a new Jeep (New Jeep)
Everything mine, I don't rent it, I keep (I keep)
All kind of cars, nigga, check out my fleet
We ran them racks up in the basement, we ain't have no cable
Buy every bando on the dead end, we ain't got no neighbors
Disrespectful to a bitch, no manners, yeah
I was runnin' through bags on Campbellton
Told the streets I'm too hot, you can't handle this
I'ma lie to your honor, I'm scandalous
