T-shirt made by Louis (Louis)
Soon as I do it they do it (do it, yeah)
Running through the money like there ain't nothing to it
I know I say it all the time but I ain't gonna do it
7.62's
Don't start everything goes on my block
Bad vibes in my archive
New Rolls Royce I don't drive

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Chanel built drip (drip)
FN extended clip (clip)
Michael [?]
Codeine take a sip (sip)
I got in my bag I ain't coming out
I still having bags I ain't running out
Sometimes I have thoughts then I have doubts
Then I go hard and it work out
Taking these perc's down I need to chill
Used to be a couple thousand now an M
I'm making moves [?] without no friend
I know she gotta go and tell her friend
Tryna give them the ball but they ain't gonna get it
They don't even wanna try cause they see us winning
Got the homie on trial I just hope he win it
I've been killing these niggas
Lord I'm a sinner

[Chorus]
