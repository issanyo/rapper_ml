[Chorus: Jordan Hollywood]
Let me find out
That ain't your car bitch that's a rental (Skirr)
That ain't your bitch you in the friend zone
That ain't Kylie bitch it's Kendal
Let me find out
Those ain't diamonds bitch them QZ's (Oo)
Spend your re-up on some Gucci (Oo)
Got a gun but you ain't shooting (Oo)
Let me find out
Snitching now you die for freedom (Snitch)
Don't throw that money when the weed come (Bitch)
You got a family but don't feed 'em (Shit)
Let me find out

[Verse 1: Jordan Hollywood]
I wish you would but you laminate
We know you fakers are mimickin'
I wore a presidential rollie
Bitches think that I'm a candidate
When it comes to all my cups
It's double or nothin', no gamblin'
You a mumble rapper ramblin'
No quarterback but that chopper have you scramblin'
Do you look like that in person
Photoshop really working
Is it editing or did you get it from a surgeon
Doctor Miami, all these hoes I be curvin'
She come to Miami, and don't go home untill I get her a Birkin
You ain't write none of your lyrics
So we don't wanna hear it
You be talking about jets
But we know you fly Spirit
You gotta pay for the baggage
55 dollars plus taxes (Yea hoe!)
That ain't your money you postin'
You lyin' in all of you captions

[Chorus: Jordan Hollywood]
Let me find out
That ain't your car bitch that's a rental (Skirr)
That ain't your bitch you in the friend zone
That ain't Kylie bitch it's Kendal
Let me find out
Those ain't diamonds bitch them QZ's (Oo)
Spend your re-up on some Gucci (Oo)
Got a gun but you ain't shooting (Oo)
Let me find out
Snitching now you die for freedom (Snitch)
Don't throw that money when the weed come (Bitch)
You got a family but don't feed 'em (Shit)
Let me find out

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Baby, heard you wanna be like me
But you don't got what it takes
Heard you don't even own no car
But you just posted a wraith, yeah
Been cappin' now for days and you can't fit in
This 2 seater got 220 on the dash and you can't get in
My dog just came home gave him a bone, he on his feet now
I swear, I'm living better
I ain't gotta sip lean for me to sleep now
My mixtapes on repeat now
Ain't gotta be in the street now
I'm still keepin' my heat now
I hope a Nigga don't think he sweet now
Heard you posting what you don't got
I just went and bought my sixth watch
I ain't cappin', I'm on my tenth car
Heard through the grapevine that money ain't yours

[Chorus: Jordan Hollywood]
Let me find out
That ain't your car bitch that a rental (Skirr)
That ain't your bitch you in the friend zone
That ain't Kylie bitch it's Kendal
Let me find out
Those ain't diamonds bitch them QZ's (Oo)
Spend your re-up on some Gucci (Oo)
Got a gun but you ain't shooting (Oo)
Let me find out
Snitching now you die for freedom (Snitch)
Don't throw that money when the weed come (Bitch)
You got a family but don't feed em (Shit)
Let me find out
