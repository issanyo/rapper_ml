[Intro]
Run that money counter baby

[Chorus]
Last night I didn't come home, my bitch probably think I was cheating
She don't even know, I was sleepin' on the low
Ain't got time for no hoes, I been on some other shit
Tryna get my mother rich, tryna get my brothers rich


[Verse 1]
They tryna ride my wave, I had to switch it up
They tryna ride in my lane, I had to buck a left
I had to cut off my feet to save myself
Stayed down and went and raised my wealth
We was waitin' on the mailman, we had to track it, he had the package
Soon as we get it the pack in, 30 minutes later racks in
Thousand dollar belt for my pants
Ridin' round beating I'm the man
I can get them bags on demand
Count the money fast with my hands
Shooters they gon' shoot on my command
Got these bands dawg
Hope out and go get it forreal, I went and got it forreal
They tryna tell me to chill, this just the way that I live
I be on syrup forreal, I just keep buyin' these seals
I know I'm never gon' squeal, give a damn how they feel
Baby Jace, sitting next to me on the roads to riches
Lil Dee, sittin' next to me on the road to riches
DT ridin' shotgun on the road to riches
They tryna ride my wave, they tryna ride my wave

[Chorus]
Last night I didn't come home my bitch probably think I was cheating
She don't even know, I was sleepin' on the low
Ain't got time for no hoes, I been on some other shit
Tryna get my mother rich, tryna get my brothers rich
Last night I didn't come home my bitch probably think I was cheating
She don't even know, I was sleepin' on the low
Ain't got time for no hoes, I been on some other shit
Tryna get my mother rich, tryna get my brothers rich


[Verse 2]
I just got a call from my dawg he just came home, told me that he got out on his dick so I'ma put him on
Couple niggas talkin' flaw, they all sing the same songs
Get a nigga left on the yard for a cellphone
I got some young niggas ready to crash out, I had a thousand pounds at the stash spot
And I'ma hold it down for the havenots
I still remember times I ain't have nothing
I ain't no greedy nigga you can have some
All of my niggas eatin' go and ask 'em
They don't want no smoke they got asthma
Bitch I'm a street nigga I ain't no rapper
They should put me on a runway, drippin' like a sundae
Make yo bitch see how this dick taste, a million off a mixtape
Niggas hate but I just dictate
I control the shots
Boy I control the block
Boy I control that rock
You gon' need a way bigger surfboard
Got allot of money but I want more
Go and get that paper ain't have no choice
My son gon' be a boss cause he's my first born

[Chorus]
Last night I didn't come my bitch probably think I was cheating
She don't even know, I was sleepin' on the low
Ain't got time for no hoes, I been on some other shit
Tryna get my mother rich, tryna get my brothers rich
Last night I didn't come my bitch probably think I was cheating
She don't even know, I was sleepin' on the low
Ain't got time for no hoes, I been on some other shit
Tryna get my mother rich, tryna get my brothers rich
