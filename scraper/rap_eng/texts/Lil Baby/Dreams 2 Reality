[Intro: Lil Baby]
Al Geno on the track
G just bounced back from a headshot
Trappin' by the roadblock
I only give until my legs out
Been a real nigga 'til my legs stop
Real trapper, my legs tired
Real trapper, my legs tired
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: NoCap]
My life was hard, it just had to be (Yeah)
Watch me turn my dreams to reality (Yeah)
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me (Yeah)
When I pop these Percs, I don't do it happily
Got a little fame, all of a sudden they change
Feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
I was so blind, I just couldn't see the hate
Forgave all them niggas, I'm still Ray

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Would have never started rappin' if I knew this shit had came with this
If I had never made a hit, would they be on my dick?
I just been sittin' back and pushin' pounds, just gettin' fit
And I got a 60 on my right wrist, I'm movin' fast like lightnin'
These other rappers tryna bite me, your baby mama wanna bite me
I swear to God she triflin', I pass her on 'cause I'm righteous
I run the jungle like Tarzan, that codeine was like poison
I cut back, I feel awesome, no playoffs but I'm ballin'
Had a good day, I scored 40 and I ain't talkin' points
I close my eyes, I still have flashbacks when I was in the joint
I hit my knees, I'm thankin' God, I'm prayin' every mornin'
I check the schedule and I'm booked up, I'm finally tourin'
I'm goin' where I wanna go, doin' what I wanna do
I can screw who I wanna screw, I came from nothin', I can never lose
Turned my dreams into reality, I thought that you'd be glad for me
I can't believe that you mad at me, damn, dawg, I'm proud of you
My life was garbage, too, but I did what I 'posed to do
And I went and bought the latest coupe, told my young nigga stay in school
But he ain't listen, now he got a .45 in the kitchen with a biscuit ready to flip it

[Chorus: Lil Baby & NoCap, NoCap, & Lil Baby]
My life was hard, it just had to be (Had to be)
Watch me turn my dreams to reality (Reality)
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me (I feel 'em after me)
When I pop these Percs, I don't do it happily (I don't do it happily)
Got little fame, all of a sudden they change
Feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
I was so blind, I just couldn't see the hate
Forgave all them niggas, I'm still Ray

[Verse 2: NoCap]
Would have never started rappin' if I knew this shit had came with this
I'm on top of all these niggas, I can see when all these angels piss
The way my nigga crossed me up, I thought his name was Chris
Don't wanna fuck around and kill my dawg, they gon' do me like I'm Vick
Yeah, they gon' really hate me if I sign a deal
I'ma go buy a Wraith, crash it on purpose, blame it on the pills
When Lil' Joe be slidin', it be look like he headed to second base
I see the hate, it look like makeup, it's all on their face
I can't see Fred no more so I be talkin' to his headstone
Sometimes I wanna catch a body, but I put my head on
Crawford finna touch down, he in the red zone
I sure got tired of sendin' him naked pictures of my red bone
Yeah, G just bounced right back off a headshot
Yeah, I won't fuck that bitch if she ain't got no ass shots
Put them choppers on the jet, we gon' air it out
25 hundred on some trap gear, we gon weigh it out
Too much dirty money, won't put that shit in the shower
Even when lights out, boy, that money still bring power
Can't serve a lot of white, but that shit look like baby powder
Got my gun at every show, I don't care if it ain't crowded
I barely sleep, but when I do, I just be dreamin'
They know I came from the bottom like bikinis
When I can't get hold to them Percs, I be fiendin'
Why would you tell me that you love me and you don't mean it?

[Chorus: NoCap]
My life was hard, it just had to be (Yeah)
Watch me turn my dreams to reality (Yeah)
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me (Yeah)
When I pop these Percs, I don't do it happily
Got a little fame, all of a sudden they change
Feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
I was so blind, I just couldn't see the hate
Forgave all them niggas, I'm still Ray

[Outro]
Would have never started rappin' if I knew this shit had came with this
I'm on top of all these niggas, I can see when all these angels piss
The way my nigga crossed me up, I thought his name was Chris
Don't wanna fuck around and kill my dawg, they gon' do me like I'm Vick
Yeah, they gon' really hate me if I sign a deal
I'ma go buy a Range, crash it on purpose, blame it on the pills
When Lil' Joe be slidin', it be look like he headed to second base
I see the hate, it look like makeup, it's all on their face
