[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I'm a glacier boy, I want solitaire in my ear
I do magic, break it down and make it disappear
I'm a glacier boy, I want VVS's on my neck
Richard Mille, AP, Rollie, Cartier, Patek
Sippin' sizzurp, almost fell asleep, I damn near wrecked
Tennis chains, drippin' on my shirt, them bitches wet
Lord, please forgive me, I know I'm a sinner
I keep me a old hoe, then get me a rental
I fucked on that [?]
My neck on a blizzard, I'm going December
I stay on the syrup, I don't probably remember
[?]
My tennis chains dancing, [?]
All white gold the Rollie, lil' bitch, this ain't silver
I came from the bottom, I hang with some killers

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Big bag of the cash when I walk through the dealer
250 cash for that new Richard Mille
Ball like the NBA, no Percy Miller
Rather sip red than I'd rather sip liquor
Bitch, tell your boyfriend to hop out the picture
Bust that lil' bitch like a Swisher, we met at the mixer, I had to walk in with my pistol
Bought a new watch and it's flooded with crystals
Real glacier boy get you killed in a whistle

[Verse 3: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Rocking Saint Laurent, the bottom vanilla
I got rich off every scale in the [?]
Fresh every day, I'm a serial killer
Glock 40 shoot like I'm Richard Mille
