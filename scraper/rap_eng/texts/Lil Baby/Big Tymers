[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Me and my, lil niggas
Just came off a lick, we found two bricks
All we know is gettin' money, on that fly shit
Play for keeps, rockin' shows, doin' fours and shit, ya digg?
Nigga try, we gun 'em down
Shout out to the plug, he front me a hundred pounds
Make one phone call, they pull up one hundred rounds
Young Roo, Young Baby run the A-Town
Them boys got new whips and full clips
Nigga play, he get flipped, he gettin' dipped
All we know is gettin' money, fuckin' hoes and shit
All we know is lay 'em down, kick in doors and shit
Real spit, this my life
In the trenches every day, I earned my stripes
Yamaha four fifty, bike life
Lost a whole quarter million on them dice, damn

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Woah, woah, woah kemosabe
Bad bitches long hair in the lobby
Woah, woah, woah kemosabe
I just pray I don't kill nobody
Woah, woah, woah kemosabe
Bad bitches long hair in the lobby
Woah, woah, woah kemosabe
I just hope I don't kill nobody

[Verse 2: Marlo]
Marlo and Young Baby, we goin' crazy
In the street worth like eight-eighty
Hellcats and drop top, off them block
Neighborhood super star, fuckin' bad broads
Goin' to the Super Bowl, me and Julio
I just made a two million dollar tab off a truckload
Young nigga stay fly and gettin' money
2 the Hard Way, nigga you know how we comin'
I just copped a Maybach off dope money
Got the sucker hang hard with no money
Then I made a one-twenty off four dummies
QC superstar, me and Baby comin', yeah

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Woah, woah, woah kemosabe
Bad bitches long hair in the lobby
Woah, woah, woah kemosabe
I just pray I don't kill nobody
Woah, woah, woah kemosabe
Bad bitches long hair in the lobby
Woah, woah, woah kemosabe
I just hope I don't kill nobody

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
G-Wagon, matte black
Run off on the migo, get the money right back
Runnin' to the bag fast like a four flat
Oh he sweet with that money, he gettin' jacked, ya digg?
White tee and white ones
Nigga pushin' big weight, call him Big Pun
I'ma go and get the money, that's on my son, ya digg?
Look at me, with QC
Went and got the bag, bust it down with Big and P
I just spent thirty racks on new teeth
Me and Marlo traphouse, them new Jeeps
Time to run the rap game, already run the streets, ya digg?

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Woah, woah, woah kemosabe
Bad bitches long hair in the lobby
Woah, woah, woah kemosabe
I just pray I don't kill nobody
Woah, woah, woah kemosabe
Bad bitches long hair in the lobby
Woah, woah, woah kemosabe
I just hope I don't kill nobody
