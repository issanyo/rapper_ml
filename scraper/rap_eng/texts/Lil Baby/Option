[Intro]
I been home 120 days, I done ran this shit all the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I done ran the money all the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Money is the only fucking option
I got partners said they need me, whatever you know I got it (Got 'em on me)
Paper route, I swear a nigga on it (Paper route, a nigga on it)
Paper route, I swear a nigga on it
The money is the only fucking option
I got partners say they need me and I got 'em
Long as I'm having all this money I'ma pop it
Long as I'm having all this money I'ma pop it

[Verse 1]
I want that bag for real, I get that cash for real (For real)
I want that bag for real, I get that cash for real (For real)
I want them B's for real, already had some M's
I want them B's for real, already had some M's
I want that money for sure, sure
I used to trap out the back door (back door)
I used to sleep on a dirty floor
I ain't go home to change clothes
We might be fucking the same hoes
But we do not have the same goals
I want that money for real, real
I get that money for real
I get down with that money every time I'm on the road
I got different kinda bitches I keep getting caught with my hoes
Every time I'm in your city I just brung another load
I don't really give a damn about doing no fucking show
I want that load, I want that load, I want that load
I get that bag, I get that bag, get it for sure
All of my diamonds real water, I don't know no
I'ma keep going, I'ma keep going

[Chorus]
Money is the only fucking option
I got partners said they need me, whatever you know I got it (Got 'em on me)
Paper route, I swear a nigga on it (Paper route, a nigga on it)
Paper route, I swear a nigga on it
The money is the only fucking option
I got partners say they need me and I got 'em
Long as I'm having all this money I'ma pop it
Long as I'm having all this money I'ma pop it

[Verse 2]
Partner swerving on the back street, probably got a Draco on me (Draco)
All these pussy niggas fake hangin', all these bitches wanna blow on me
I got real money, real money, real, real, real, real money
I been grinding since a youngin'
I been trapping since Monday (Last Monday)
I got real rich homie, no Quan
I'ma beat the pack out 'til its done
Told my mama back then I'm the one
Told the plug just bring me up 1
I want money, I want money for real
I want money, I want money for real
I want money, I want money for real
(Chasin' money 'til my heart stop)
Chasing money 'til my heart stop
I'ma keep on 'til my heart stop
Chasing money 'til my heart stop
I won't stop until my heart stop
I can't let up on these niggas
I can't let up on these bitches
I'ma keep getting that money
I'm just tryna keep it rich
Chasing money 'til my heart stop
Chasing money 'til my heart stop
Chasing money 'til my heart stop
I won't stop until my heart stop
I can't let up on these niggas
I can't let up on these bitches
I'ma keep getting that money
I'm just tryna keep it rich

[Chorus]
Money is the only fucking option
I got partners said they need me, whatever you know I got it (Got 'em on me)
Paper route, I swear a nigga on it (Paper route, a nigga on it)
Paper route, I swear a nigga on it
The money is the only fucking option
I got partners say they need me and I got 'em
Long as I'm having all this money I'ma pop it
Long as I'm having all this money I'ma pop it

[Outro]
I'm just tryna beat another case
I just probably beat another case
I been home 120 days, I done ran this shit all the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I done ran the money all the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I done ran the money all the way
I just hope I don't catch another case
I'm just tryna dodge another case
I done ran the money all the way
I been home 120 days
I been home 120 days
I been home 120 days
