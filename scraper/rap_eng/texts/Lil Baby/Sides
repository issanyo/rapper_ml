[Intro]
Cook that shit up Quay
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
I'm 'bout to lift off

[Chorus]
Always with the guys, never picking sides
New crib big as fuck, you should see inside
Four car garage, you can pick a ride
Everything I say facts, these niggas tellin' lies
I been heatin' up, I'm 'bout to lift off
I been heatin' up, I'm 'bout to lift off
In the studio all day, I turn my flip off
YSL jean jacket, I be dripped out

[Verse 1]
Mama couldn't pay the rent so we got kicked out
Now her living room plush, I pay the rent now
Got a million in my bank account, I'm lit now
Redbone from overseas getting dick now
I put VVS on my teeth, I put VVS on my bitch
I put VVS on my kids, niggas can't do the shit that I did
Signed for a two million dollar deal, I put a half a mil on my crib
Man this trap shit really real, I ain't been rapping for a year
My lil niggas in the cut throwing gang signs
I been running with the guys, I got mob ties
Keep my shooters in the house, they don't come outside
Ain't sleepin' 'til we eatin', ain't letting shit slide

[Chorus]
Always with the guys, never picking sides
New crib big as fuck, you should see inside
Four car garage, you can pick a ride
Everything I say facts, these niggas tellin' lies
I been heatin' up, I'm 'bout to lift off
I been heatin' up, I'm 'bout to lift off
In the studio all day, I turn my flip off
YSL jean jacket, I be dripped out

[Verse 2]
I was just sittin' in the prison but I'm rich now
Thinking 'bout the time I wasted, I bust my wrist down
Seven-figure young nigga no more licks now
But if he sweet I want it all, I make him get down
My sisters ain't gotta worry, my niggas ain't gotta learn
My system filled up with syrup, I'ma keep poppin' these percs
Told my label I quit trappin', hope they know that was a joke
Told my plug I'm never quitting, he can bring another load
I put Fear of God on my jacket, put Givenchy on my coat
Every now and then I still fuck a rachet, it's just somethin' 'bout her throat
I'm a god in my hood, give them young niggas hope
Put a mil up in case I ain't never goin' broke

[Chorus]
Always with the guys, never picking sides
New crib big as fuck, you should see inside
Four car garage, you can pick a ride
Everything I say facts, these niggas tellin' lies
I been heatin' up, I'm 'bout to lift off
I been heatin' up, I'm 'bout to lift off
In the studio all day, I turn my flip off
YSL jean jacket, I be dripped out
