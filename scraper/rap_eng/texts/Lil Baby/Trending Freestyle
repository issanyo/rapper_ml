[Chorus]
I'm trending, I'm trending
Shootin' dice, shirt off in the middle of Memphis, of Memphis
I know them niggas hitters so all the sticks came with me, with me
Shootin' ceelo, fucked around, won a fifty, a fifty
It was me and C-Bo, Z-Bo gettin' busy, busy
Niggas screaming they don't like me
Fuck them niggas, we can get it, get it
Nigga shot at the Sprinter, not a shot didn't even hit it, hit it
Soon as we find out who did it, he gon' come up missin', missin'
Go against me, lose your life, this shit can get risky, risky

[Verse 1]
Ah shit, ah shit
I'm in the booth with a carbon
Niggas be sayin' they gon' rob me
See them niggas, they keep walkin'
I'm with my dogs, they barking
Any problems, then they sparking
We was posted up on Spark
Tryna get it in the dark
Nigga we gettin' it, we gettin'
I fuck with Yo Gotti and Dolph so this shit ain't my business, my business
You need a pack and the money good, I'ma send it, send it
My youngins shootin' shit, they don't give a fuck, they ign'ant, they ign'ant
I ain't goin' back and forth, a nigga better not diss me
I did my time on my own
Stood up like a man and claimed that shit
Every time I turn around, a pussy nigga got my name in shit
I bust it down with my niggas, I do my show with my glizzy
Fuckin' other niggas' bitches, Hi-Tech on me, I been sippin'
They just keep on takin' pictures, they know me

[Chorus]
I'm trending, I'm trending
Shootin' dice, shirt off in the middle of Memphis, of Memphis
I know them niggas hitters so all the sticks came with me, with me
Shootin' ceelo, fucked around, won a fifty, a fifty
It was me and C-Bo, Z-Bo gettin' busy, busy
Niggas screaming they don't like me
Fuck them niggas, we can get it, get it
Nigga shot at the Sprinter, not a shot didn't even hit it, hit it
Soon as we find out who did it, he gon' come up missin', missin'
Go against me, lose your life, this shit can get risky, risky

[Verse 2]
I'm in this bitch with Lil Marlo
I'm sippin' syrup by the bottle, yeah yeah
Bitches love me, they gon' follow
They gon' bust it for a dollar, yeah yeah
Zay, that my brother, swear that I love him
Nigga try him, we gon' bust, it get ugly
Me and Big Dre was fucked up together
I found a plug and sent some pounds to the ghetto
I had to sell some bags to make a profit
I get the money, ain't no other option
Ain't cuffin' no bitch, I don't fuck with the coppin'
Get the bag and bust it down with my partners
I'm trending
Built Ford tough, I ain't foldin', I ain't bending, bending
Count the money last night and this shit was a million, million
I had a vision I was gon' be rich
I spent a whole seventy on my wrist
I won't go in if my lil niggas can't get in
They was frontin' on a nigga back then
Now I done fucked her and all of her friends
She'll never give that answer again
They ain't write when I was stuck in the pen
Guess them niggas couldn't find a pen

[Chorus]
I'm trending, I'm trending
Shootin' dice, shirt off in the middle of Memphis, of Memphis
I know them niggas hitters so all the sticks came with me, with me
Shootin' ceelo, fucked around, won a fifty, a fifty
It was me and C-Bo, Z-Bo gettin' busy, busy
Niggas screaming they don't like me
Fuck them niggas, we can get it, get it
Nigga shot at the Sprinter, not a shot didn't even hit it, hit it
Soon as we find out who did it, he gon' come up missin', missin'
Go against me, lose your life, this shit can get risky, risky
