[Intro]
Yeah
Cook that shit up, Quay
I look up, I see I got bout seven rides in the streets
Know what I'm saying?
Living life to the fullest, you know what I'm saying?

[Chorus]
Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great (I'm straight)
I just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
I sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
So many blue hundreds they stickin' like they counterfeit, I print this shit
Whole lot of ones I'm in the cut, I'm going dumb-dumb
I'm sippin' act', and that shit real deal, do you want some?
Same one that tryin' run with the clique
Be the same ones that throwing salt at the clit
Main reason I'm fuckin' ya bitch, I ain't gonna say shit

[Verse 1]
I asked you about it, you lied
You asked me about it, I kept it 100, I'm nothin' like these other guys
I really spent two thousand on kicks and only wear 'em one time
Something about a nigga mind frame
Diamonds doing jumpin'-jacks in the AP, I can make the time change
Two hundred hoes in my call log and I ain't got not a name saved
Took her out the hood, put her on the drip, now I got her rockin' name brand
Me and Ced had two different spots, we usually around the corner doin' the same thing
Everywhere I go my chains hang, free the bros out the chain gang
New Maybach cost 230, I don't even get my shoes dirty
I don't even sleep when I get tired, you can see the Adderall in my eyes
Tiger said he got the drop on the album
Fuck it slide and shoot up the block
Niggas know how we come through
G5 out the sunroof

[Chorus]
Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great (I'm straight)
I just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
I sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
So many blue hundreds they stickin' like they counterfeit, I print this shit
Whole lot of ones I'm in the cut, I'm going dumb-dumb
I'm sippin' act', and that shit real deal, do you want some?
Same one that tryin' run with the clique
Be the same ones that throwing salt at the clit
Main reason I'm fuckin' ya bitch, I ain't gonna say shit

[Verse 2]
We use trap out my ma house, turn the condo to a hideout
We can't be fuckin' at my house, niggas be runnin' they damn mouth
Walk down on them broad daylight, it ain't no fun in no drive-by
I'm cool on the love and the high-fives
You niggas can't keep up with my guys
You can't get all this drip in a lifetime
I got out and ran it up at the right time
We got Dracos whenever it's nighttime
We ain't ever gonna stop at the stop sign
Went to wafi, I told 'em I want to shine
Then the coupe quarter million, they wiped me down
I'm running this town, everything I say facts niggas can't take that
New Lamborghini 18'
Only thing I do is make cream, I don't why these niggas hating
Only thing I do is drink lean, rest in peace to Fredo Santana
I just keep on buying all these Fantas
I don't want to go out like that, only thing I know is get racks

[Chorus]
Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great (I'm straight)
I just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
I sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
So many blue hundreds they stickin' like they counterfeit, I print this shit
Whole lot of ones I'm in the cut, I'm going dumb-dumb
I'm sippin' act', and that shit real deal, do you want some?
Same one that tryin' run with the clique
Be the same ones that throwing salt at the clit
Main reason I'm fuckin' ya bitch, I ain't gonna say shit
