[Intro: Paper Lovee]
Oh, KP on the beat
Yeah, oh no

[Chorus: Paper Lovee]
I ain't got no socks on in these Balenci's
I'm gon' pop on these niggas instantly
'Cause I know, yeah, 'cause I know
I ain't got no socks on in these Balenci's
I'm gon' pop on these niggas instantly
'Cause I know, yeah, 'cause I know
I ain't got no socks on in these Balenci's
I'm gon' pop on these niggas instantly
'Cause I know these bitches into me
Yeah, I know these bitches into me

[Verse 1: Paper Lovee]
I'm in the booth and I ain't got no fuckin' socks on (ain't got no socks on)
But you know I'ma get my pop on (I'ma get my pop on)
And yeah my brotha got his Glock on (know he keep the Glock on)
Best believe he gon' get his pop on (he gon' get his pop on)
These niggas gon' start to drop off (swear they is)
It's ugly for you and your whole clique, y'all not on (I swear you ain't)
So stop poppin' like you got it, you is not on (I swear you ain't)
This shit that we on, we real, right and y'all wrong  (I swear you ain't)
Yeah, I'm just poppin' shit, this from the dome (I swear you ain't)
My niggas in the booth with me and when we go home
My yellow bitch'll roll a blunt for two and get stoned
Ain't worried 'bout shit, you know that the shit we do we grown

[Chorus: Paper Lovee]
I ain't got no socks on in these Balenci's
I'm gon' pop on these niggas instantly
'Cause I know these bitches into me
Yeah, I know these bitches into me
And I ain't got no socks on in these Balenci's
I'm gon' pop on these niggas instantly
'Cause I know these bitches into me
Yeah, I know these bitches into me

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I know that they into me (she into)
I think that I'm in too deep
I got all of these bad bitches followin' (they followin')
I just went and got my dollars up, they taller than (they taller than)
I done been behind the walls with some solid men (solid men)
I done been in and out, didn't fold, I stand tall with them (stand tall with them)
Draped in all this water, someone drench me (drench me)
Sometimes I feel like I'm dreamin', someone pinch me (someone pinch me)
I didn't put no socks in these Givenchy's (these Givenchy's)
I went straight up to the top, my niggas with me (they with me)
I got dawgs who only call, I'll prolly never see
'Cause they stuck behind the wall, the penitentiary

[Chorus: Paper Lovee]
I ain't got no socks on in these Balenci's
I'm gon' pop on these niggas instantly
'Cause I know these bitches into me
Yeah, I know these bitches into me
And I ain't got no socks on in these Balenci's
I'm gon' pop on these niggas instantly
'Cause I know these bitches into me
Yeah, I know these bitches into me
I ain't got no socks on in these Balenci's
I'm gon' pop on these niggas instantly
'Cause I know these bitches into me
Yeah, I know these bitches into me
