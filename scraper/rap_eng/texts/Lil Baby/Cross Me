[Intro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Can I see that lighter? Thank you, um
Do you think, um, I can make them, like
Feel me on this song, like, without saying too much?
I kept on begging you to stay
I couldn't hold on, so please forgive me, I wasn't strong
I take my lick and I move on
Fuck them niggas for life, the way they did me wrong

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I was blind when they crossed me (Yeah)
I was blind when they crossed me (I was blind)
I was blind when they crossed me (Oh I)
I was blind when they crossed me

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I could put this shit on everything
I had came out the back door
For this shit, man, I was struggling for so long
Pray every day, protect myself, and tote that fucking pole
I mind my business, I'm not like these niggas or these hoes
Been deceived, I donâ€™t know nothin' but throw them B's
I tell lil' shorty come be on the winning team, please
I told that bitch she best believe
I told that boy it's 4K Trey, I tote that beam
Oh, how the fuck you do me wrong?
Left me for a nigga that wasn't worth it like me
I put in work to be with you, he ain't deserve it like me
I was low-key in a coupe, they put the word out on me

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & Plies]
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me (I was blind)
I was blind when they crossed me (Yeah, ayy, YB)
I was blind when they crossed me (This a Plies check-in, bro)
I was blind when they crossed me (Know this shit took cash to drop)

[Verse 2: Plies]
I been used by niggas, I been used by bitches
One thing I ain't never do was get in my feelings
Most of these niggas never been in no trenches
None of these hoes, don't put in my business
I don't need no nigga, I don't need no bitch
'Cause if I get locked up they ain't gon' send me shit
Got a bag, I'll put it on your head, lil' bitch
Y'all broke ass niggas can't tell me shit
L-O-V-E, that ain't me
M-O-N-E-Y, that's me
I don't trust y'all niggas far as I can see
Most y'all hoes fuckin' more than me
Can't fuck with everybody what I learned in these streets
Niggas only show up when it's time to eat
Jump in that water, better hope you can swim
'Cause I'm tellin' you, lil' nigga, I'm playing for keeps
Most of you broke hoes ain't got shit
Want me to fuck, gotta pay for this dick
Only love I'm showing is to my fam
Tryna stay rich, give a fuck 'bout no 'Gram
I got gold now, ten mill' a month
Want me to save you, ho? I ain't the one
YB, YB, run it up
Most you fuck niggas talk too much

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I was blind when they crossed me (Yeah)
I was blind when they crossed me (I was blind)
I was blind when they crossed me (Oh I)
I was blind when they crossed me

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I'm in that 'Vette again (Slatt), I just went top speed
I should've knew they would cross me
They sit around, talk about me
We carry Dracos that chop trees (Yeah)
I get that bag and I put it up 'cause I know ain't shit free (Nah)
We was in love, I came and pulled up, I know she miss me
She ride that dick like a ten-speed
I'm with the gang, I can't switch teams
No more handcuffs, I wear APs
Take off my watch, let my wrist breathe
We been gettin' money and we been thuggin' since we was young boys
Now look at me, I just bought a foreign, the same one as YoungBoy
Go to my shows when I'm drunk, boy
My youngins, they shoot-out for fun
A convicted felon, I'm keeping my gun
It's just how we livin', we come from the slums
Now when the police pull up, we don't run
Young rich nigga, do what we want
Private jet so I'm sittin' in the front, yeah
How could you cross me? How could you cross me?
How could you cross me? How could you cross me?
How could you cross me? How could you cross me?
How could you cross me? How could you cross me?

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me (I was blind)
I was blind when they crossed me (Yeah)
I was blind when they crossed me (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I was blind when they crossed me (When they crossed me)
