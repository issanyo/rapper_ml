[Verse 1: Slug]
I'm looking at that empty glass, like it might look back
And if it did would it recognize the fact
That I need to find a way to relax
That won't require me to drink away the rain and the fire that paint the tracks
The judgement passed upon that awful taste
Time flies too fast but it's not a race
You see it on my face, I'm trying to concentrate
But everything's too blurry to accommodate
I gotta chase the impossible
But every option starts up with a shot and ends up as an obstacle
Maybe I should just drink at home
Tell me, why would a prisoner leave his throne?
Even when I stand still, I'm still on the run
I'm the son of my father, got a bottle of some
And this goes to those of us that only live once
But don't remember nothing when the morning comes
C'mon
C'mon

[Chorus: Slug, St. Paul Slim & sample]
And so I drink to the life of those that drink to death
If I can't save the day I might as well fade away
And so I drink to the life of those that drink to death
If I can't save the day I might as well fade away
(Oh yeah) Fade away, fade away
(Oh yeah) Fade away, fade away

[Verse 2: St. Paul Slim]
Scene 2, this is the part
Where my face hits the windshield and it stops my heart
Driving the wrong fucking way down a one way
Doing 55 in a 30, 3 AM, Monday
No one on the block but me and the cops
If I can make it to the crib, I'll do it again, watch
I been drinking since noon, fucking buffoons
As far as amounts I lost count, I don't know what I consumed
I never do, drink 'till I'm dumb
Some say I'm lush, others think I'm a bum
But I think I'm in love 'till death do us part, and even then too
I'm a hell's kitchen, bottle of Don Q
I love the taste of it, put it to my face like I'm face fucking
And the pain? It'll erase nothing
I'm delusional
I wrote this shit hungover at my job noddin' off at my cubicle
Life is beautiful

[Chorus: Slug, St. Paul Slim & sample]
And so I drink to the life of those that drink to death
If I can't save the day I might as well fade away
(Oh yeah) And so I drink to the life of those that drink to death
If I can't save the day I might as well fade away
(Oh yeah) Fade away, fade away
(Oh yeah) Fade away, fade away
