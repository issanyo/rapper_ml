[Verse 1: P.O.S.]
It's been a bit; you look a little sick
You got the vibe of a ghost and I'm not equipped
But I can host, or I can drive, and a ride might be right
Just hit the gas and crash tonight
Must have been a beast
I bet you still rock a sweater in the heat, right?
And you can stand like it's not that bad
But I only hear from you when it is, and you know that

[Verse 2: Slug]
My agenda, is pure, I'm sure you remember
The dialogue that occurred, I would render
The whole canvas blue
If it was just another bender to manage through
Guess it depends on the day-to-day
Most days I don't even wanna see your face
Don't say that you don't need love; it's old
Act tough, but your blood's exposed

[Hook: Slug & P.O.S.]
I like the way you comb your hair
And I love them stylish clothes you wear
You've got some lights you're down to share
It seems as if you want to care
Good luck: the game you play ain't fair
Still stuck on why you're standin' there
We'll keep your name in silent prayer
Tear down that self-made cross you bear

[Verse 3: P.O.S.]
I've been your ride the last few years
I've seen you through when no one's there
I finally get why that's the case
We let the liar lie in wake
Up, it don't deserve my sleep
And I can't catch a wink 'til you stop, 'til you think
'Til you're clean, 'til you quit, 'til you're done; this is it
I'm at the end of my rope
You're at the end of your wick

[Verse 4: Slug]
Midday with your bright stage light on your
Mistakes, more weight and the frame might
Give way to the offbeat dance 'til the
Cit-ay and the concrete cracks in here
I still watch you cause I believe
There's something true behind your teeth
It's in them secrets that you keep
Fish out of water trying to breathe

[Hook: Slug & P.O.S.]
I like the way you comb your hair
And I love them stylish clothes you wear
You've got some lights you're down to share
It seems as if you want to care
Good luck: the game you play ain't fair
Still stuck on why you're standin' there
We'll keep your name in silent prayer
Tear down that self-made cross you bear

[Verse 5: Slug]
Bear with me, it's wrong to stare
But somehow I'm on it like it's what you wanted
Now I'm here, whistlin' a song and tears
That might fall on a pair of distracted ears
Are you listening? It's the sound of toy handcuffs
And another voice you can't trust
Disrupt the self-destruct
Waitin' for the ball to hit the ground just to watch it bounce up

[Verse 6: P.O.S.]
Up, and down the same steps
We both have climbed that bind and connect us
I still feel the itch sometimes, but it lets up
You scratch 'til you bleed; you bleed just to prove life
So you can see it with your own two
But it's mixed with a mess and it's not you
Can you hear me past the heartbeat?
Or do you only know I care when our eyes meet?

[Hook: Slug & P.O.S.] (x2)

Still stuck on why you're standin' there
We'll keep your name in silent prayer
Tear down that self-made cross you bear
