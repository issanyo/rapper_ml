(scratching "Big Slug")

How easily I put my foot into the shoe I now boast
Simply for the chance to wiggle my toes
How little I know, that gets followed down this dead end
How much mind I misplace in the name of a girlfriend
When the world bends, and changes its form
I'll throw a raincoat on and fornicate with a storm
I'll be the same as before, like nothing you've ever known
Trying to feel my way through the weather looking for home
But till that time arrives ill keep designing my life
Arrive the need to survive without this disguise
Counter clockwise, cross the I's, dot the t's
And run circles around these docile hypocrisies
They don't understand, good
Watch how long it took for them to break it down
And find out its not just a song it's a way of death
It's a don't take a step, it's a save your breath and then came the yes

(scratching "rhyme sayer")

So heres an ode to those who feel they're under control
Like they don't have a whole firm hold on their own soul
Nothing but snow, makes for rough when its cold
You can roll or you can cut your loss and drop your load
From the woman I know that give their partners their all
To the ones that watch and wait for their lovers to fall
To the single file line a mile long in the hall
To the ones that work the cashier jobs down at the strip malls
If the rat bites its tale, you gonna hear it scream
"This is not my life", what is it? A dream?
Between letting off steam and empty bottles redeemed
Was it hard for you to pull me apart by the seams?
Take a deep breath so you can smell the city
Put the alcohol down its fucking up your kidney
No longer will I let them spin me round till I'm dizzy
Either walk away or walk with me
