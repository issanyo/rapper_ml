[Chorus]
And i know
(Take the elevator straight to the top)
It isn't healthy
But my self esteem is so low
(Take the elevator)
Pop a xanax for the panic as my heart begins to slow
(Straight to the top)

And i know
(Take the elevator)
This feeling inside isn't the way i wanna go
(Straight to the top)
I had too many other plans to unfold
(Straight to the top)
But now i don't know

I recognize the moon it refelects my face
I ride a horse named broom she protects my space
I keep my feelings in a custom case
Plus i've got a way to escape
Just in case

I come from the wrong side of the force field
I'm like a father to the kids from this  corn field
So slick probably slip on an orange peel
Playing with my hair trying to see how those thorns feel
Lets take the elevator straight to the top
Because famous or not it's all the same when you drop
Just as long as you've got the right name on your rock
And even the good guys are afraid of the cops
These lakes get deep when you play for keeps
You should probably say the least
To say the least
Cause your voice ain't nothing but an egg full of tweets
While you sitting on a toilet while your legs fall asleep

[Chorus]
And i know
(Take the elevator straight to the top)
It isn't healthy
But my self esteem is so low
(Take the elevator)
Pop a xanax for the panic as my heart begins to slow
(Straight to the top)

And i know
(Take the elevator)
This feeling inside isn't the way i wanna go
(Straight to the top)
I had too many other plans to unfold
(Straight to the top)
But now i don't know

I'm sitting here looking happy while inside i'm dying
Watching as the sun starts to drown in the horizon
With the courage of lion and the heart of a tin man
There'd be something more than spit at the bottom of this tin can
But i'm still a shit man a sick tongue and quick hands still holding up like my Dynospectrum kickstand

Take pulls from this vape pen to cover up my death breath
I haven't showered in a week and my teeth look like thin threads
(eeww)
Surprised i'm not dead but sometimes i'm barely breathing
I refuse to give in until that drum stops beating
Bank accounts depleting and my hairline's receiding
I even tricked myself  with a mouth that's so deceiving
No i'm not greedy i just want my piece of pie
I can't help but feel that somebody out there got mine
Maybe that's part of the drive, something to compel me
I fish for compliments and other nice things people tell me

And i know
It isn't healthy
But my self esteem is so low
Popping xanax for the panic as my heart begins to slow
Oh no

(spanish?)

Never say that won't happen to me
Life has a funny way of proving us wrong
Winter winter winter winter
