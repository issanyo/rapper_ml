[Verse 1: Illogic]
He was drenched in broken smiles, open arms and shattered hearts
Lost a step with every mile, with consequence as works of art
Framed perfect, was always scared to finish what he starts
The same worthless image get back from the mirror surface
Then he felt the spark, wing tips script seamless flight plans
Raising the bar, reaching for stars until one's captive in each hand
Blinded brilliance ill's resilience, feel the passion
I brave the flames floating on streams of tears staying dragon fly
Fear's a luxury I can't afford to buy
My son's are watching me, I got to be a hero in their eyes
I got the shoulders of a front line soldier
So my peers can have faith that i'll show up to hold up the falling sky

[Hook]

[Illogic]
Time is always there, but the moment's never perfect
Visions not so clear, but the he's feeling seems so worth it
Time is always there, but the moment's never perfect
Visions not so clear, but the way he's feeling seems so worth it

[Slug]
There's no need to cry, don't shed a tear
The locks will soon break, freedom is near
Be who you are, and envy no one
Reach for the stars, to capture the sun

[Verse 2: Illogic]
Honesty lies when the sun falls asleep
So we find truth in the moonlight for the cycle of it, and we love it
Never been fond of beyond my reach, remain calm to the common leech
Trying to latch on to my uncommon speech
I speak with action because talk is cheap
Admission is pay attention
Every purchase is a priceless masterpiece to pass to your children
I lasso ambiguity and rest it on the horizon
Hog-tied pain for you to see a pure heart to confide in
Lost today in a pack of smokes, found tomorrow in Jiryn's hopes
My pants were fixed until my pockets broke
You see the wing tips script seamless flight plan
I'm raising the bar
Reaching the stars to hold the sun in both hands
Understand

[Hook]
