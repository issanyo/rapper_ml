[Verse 1: Slug]
It's like the World Fair, but this world ain't fair
We pay fare to the world and this world don't share
Got me staring at the bottom of my glass
Like I'm scared for the future and I'm sorry for my past
Fashion alcoholic, 'nough cards to deal wit'
Raising on the term to make it seem like the meals fit
They way I call it, I want them all to feel it
Get my hand on the devil's wallet and try to steal it
But there's got the be more than this
Than just forcing my portion of the mortgage, shit
I'm trying to navigate but I don't know where the border is
About to forfeit and let them burn down that orphanage
Standing in the storm, can't feel the rain
But it must be gasoline, look at how it feeds the flame
Yeah I made my bed, the sheets are still stained
From the women, whisky and weed trying to kill the pain
Ain't getting off until the last stop
The [?] be on the left, tryna hack into her laptop
American daymare, beware me girl
White boy in the back with the carefree curl

[Chorus: Muja & Slug]
What's this world coming to?
Hey I don't know but all the girls is in love with you
Alikewise, all the girls is in love with you
Probably so, what good is that gonna do?
I don't know man, what's this world coming to?
Hey I don't know but all the girls is in love with you
Likewise, all the girls is in love with you
So hey world, give it up for Slug and Mu

[Verse 2: Muja Messiah]
You can't put a price on my life, you can't hate on my art
Art imitates life, life imitates art
I never cross my heart, never hope to die
But I always cross my T's and dot my I's
I was conceived in the mustard green Cutlass Supreme
Lucky me, at the time I was the youngest of three
'Till my big sister drowned in the river
Years later my brother got gunned down and they never found the killer
I know I'm next, yup, death's coming for me
I mean, what you expect? Shit, death comes in threes
Or does it? Well fuck it I ain't at all superstitious
When I was younger I suffered from lack of supervision
Now, I defy all authority, government tried deporting me
But I'm more American than apple pie and heroin
God forbid I get caught, that'd be embarrassing
As far as my mama know, I'm a good Samaritan
But that's so far from the truth
I got my back against the wall and my neck in the noose
Therefore I release my stress in the booth
Good looking Slug, son, you know this collabo was long overdue

[Chorus: Muja & Slug]
What's this world coming to?
Hey I don't know but all the girls is in love with you
Alikewise, all the girls is in love with you
Probably so, what good is that gonna do?
I don't know man, what's this world coming to?
Hey I don't know but all the girls is in love with you
Likewise, all the girls is in love with you
So hey world, give it up for Slug and Mu
