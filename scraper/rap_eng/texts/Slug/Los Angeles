(Oh yeah) Los Angeles, hot and bothered
Helicopters watch their daughters play parking lot soccer
A whole lot of love from the target's hide
Got a soul looking for a magic carpet ride
Environment, perfect for a hustle
Many people are distracted by the puzzle
And while they're not lookin', the angel got tooken
Welcome to the gray space between fingerprinting and booking
Do your best cause the lesson is love
It's enough to keep your head up, another day to get up
Wake up, and let the sun shine through the smog
Free the dialogue 'til everyone believes in God
L.A., to some it's hell, to some it's play
Pay the cover charge and watch what you say
The Barbie doll's caught, body parts come off
And I think she's a he...STOP, look at how it walks
They got the weirdoes, the talent, the beautiful
An arm and a leg for a one-story cubicle
And if the heat don't beat you, the pigs will
Everyone's relaxed, but no one can sit still
Los Angeles... I love it, I love it...
(Lips glisten... believe I'm gonna miss it)
(I'll be back)

Ooh, California highway... California my way
