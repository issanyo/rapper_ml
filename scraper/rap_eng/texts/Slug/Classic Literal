[Hook]
Every line is visual graphic like the face of death
Facing death slicing throats murdering your breath

[Verse 1: I Self Devine]
Facing threats macing veterans
Intelligent with treachery
We've mastered getting blacklisted
Stay speaking ebony, mahogany, ghetto odyssey
Far from stolen prophecies
Struggling
Overcoming oppression psychologically
I push envelopes, kick down tables
Push labels, rocking snatch cables
Far from unstable
Bought jewels, fought crews
Captured on the news, wide tv screen
Pigs flashing high beams while I
Exhale the yellow steam
Blazing avocado-green
We army fatigued
Inside the green natural leaf
Never expose heat and disclose beef
I was this close to furniture and clothes in the street
I'm not born to sleep I'm born to see truth in all the words I speak
Flip beats, concieve a classic under ten G's

[Hook x4]
Every line is visual graphic like the face of death
Facing death slicing throats murdering your breath

[Verse 2: I Self Devine]
Pushing towards 30 taboo for most MC's it's like benchpressing buildings while you stand on your knees
Maybe knowledgable wisdom
Fifty-sixty degrees?
A clear vision as I ice skate through gravel with ease
I've seen everything at least once
The wheels keep rolling
As you try to square it up and stifle whole movements
Used to carry rifles up at school
Found students cheating death
Foolish and graduated to ruthless
Rappers like the blues mistakes
Students for masters
That's why we here
Show improvement just what we after
Kool Akeim Allah
Beat architect general
When I Self majesty be ruling rap literal

[Hook x4]
Every line is visual graphic like the face of death
Facing death slicing throats murdering your breath

[Verse 3: I Self Devine]
Wasn't used to success
Just struggling and mean mugging
Woke up from a dream where I put seventy two slugs in
The lawyer reloaded eight times, that's drama for ya
Don't attach to material things it will destroy ya
"Wanna know about the industry? Don't fuck with it."
Russian roulette, unsafe sex is a better bet
Mafia targets, chi chi men running shit
But we be running shit from outside street offices

[Hook x4]
Every line is visual graphic like the face of death
Facing death slicing throats murdering your breath

[New beat]

[Verse 4: I Self Devine]
Stressed out. Stressed

Stressed out. Overworked
But gotta make things connect
This is just one of those angles of the game
On some quest for fire shit
Neck deep in the water
Keep the flame lit
My mental activates the same shit
Remain sick
A mental patient on the way I see this nation
Cause I see rudiments of illusion
Take things on face value only once
Trusted
They try to play us crazy
I'm often paranoid
But they can not faze me
I'm an insomniac
Ex-kleptomaniac
Vandalist
Born damaging
A natural born assassin from the deceptive streets of Los Angeles
From the one block radius
Switches up from ghetto blocks to glamorous
My eyes burn
Plus my muscles ache
Plus my knuckles scraped up from scuffling
And duck taping up fake thugs
We enroll in school
Give them direction
Cause we be filling quotas up in criminal correction
