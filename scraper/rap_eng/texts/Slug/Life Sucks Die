Die for the plight, die just to fight,  i’m dying to grab the mic, dying to see the light, die for love or hate, die to escape, die for the high, just die, you’re gonna die...
Junkies get high and junkies die and most of y’all probably won’t know me until I OD, believe what they told me, hate what they sold me, kept the complaints in my head to dull the edge.

Joe Cocker nailed it when he said you can leave your hat on, now everything goes out to those that passed on, that’s wrong that’s right that’s whack, that’s tight, personnel took the Duracell‘s out of my flashlight, site the way with the ideas of others, can’t follow the voices until I hear my brothers ,Catch me in the alleyway behind the hardware store huffing, most of us die for nothing, you’re gonna die
Die for that bitch and die for what you did, could die from the cops, die for the props, die for the earth, die behind your words, an eye for an eye, just die

It’s super unleaded in bedded within my head trips, kept it in check with the skeptics and the dead wits, when it festers, infects, it fills up with fluid, applied the pressure, bursts satisfied the thirst, drink to the pain, you’re all hurting for the answer, it’s simple and plain, you’re all gonna die from cancer. We all try to make the process faster,I need relief, because we all want to lie down in the pasture.

Twenty20 site so I’ve got no excuse my soul has broken loose from overuse who will hold the news while I make certain it fits me judgment first impressions somewhat shifting but 50 paces passed this place is the waystation filled with familiar faces the taste of the predecessor was much stronger and the lines that you’re sucking off the mirror is getting longer
Each one a try to teach one when it begun, struggling for freedom trying to build a kingdom,  now you’re sipping on Seagrams trying to fix a threesome between you your girl in that bitch with the Nissan ,  wheels keep spinning Excelerator Styx sugar up your coffee and cellophane your dick, Lace the Spliff,  but measure the dosage right , cuz’ life’s a bitch... and Imma hold it tight.  Cuz’  life’s a bitch...and imma hold it tight
Dying with vigor,   Cry me a river ...
