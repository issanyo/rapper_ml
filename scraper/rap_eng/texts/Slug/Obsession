[Verse 1]
He ain't free, thinks he is
Convinced himself nobody beats the biz
The sleep he gets, it's well deserved
For the work that he fits into this hell on earth
Failed at first, late reaction
So yell the words, relay the passion
Get no satisfaction nothing to show
Because once you achieve there's no higher to go
Set some new goals reach for the branches
Make up new steps teach em to dance it
Dismantle that box make your kid proud
See that face in the crowd and make her get loud
Keep breaking it down building it up
Don't let thrill interrupt while you filling your cup
Look there's some money look there's some honey
Look as that bridge as it burns it's so lovely
Whew! So hungry so exhausted
Happiness no turning back once you've crossed it
I won't quit till I'm holding the rings
Because they let a puppet start pulling the strings

[Hook]
I don't think I should love you like I love you x8

[Verse 2]
He ain't free but he thinks he is
Live to work work to eat eat to live
Running in place don't require much practice
So challenge your fire desire that madness
Wrap a smile around them cigarette stained teeth
Teach me to believe in those things that you can't see
Understand me another casual casualty
Trying to feed the need to bleed for a family
She said yea right and where'd you sleep last night
What your Mag like and where you keep your flashlight
And I said lady I'm a drifter maybe I'll get with you
And when you start to hate me you can blame my baby sitter
You're trying to know me well take it there and make the error
Cause I don't even recognize the face in the mirror
By this time tomorrow a new set of lips
Will be talking to me about why I exist
Everyday's a self doubt holiday nowadays
Somehow not the same sad clown that my momma raised
Galileo on this third ball of play-doh
Trying to hug the rail but I think ill save that for another day

[Hook]

[Outro]
This is so wrong, but this is so right
But this is my life, this is madness that's what it is madness

I don't think I should love you like I love you x7
This is madness that's what it is madness
