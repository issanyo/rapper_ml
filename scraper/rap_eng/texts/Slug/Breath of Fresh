Count to ten...
Take a break of fresh...

[Verse 1]
From as far away as the other side of everything
Comes a Dynospectrum substance similar to amphetamines
When used under prescribed regulations, it's a wonder drug
But abused, aftermath of the overdose is nothing to love
Potency, the key word; don't take it lightly
Accessible through the underground market, and not too pricey
Enticing regular customers from experimentals
When the rush hits comprehension grips, clears the mental
Credentials, what we got that they can't take?
So I stir up the eggs and drip my syrup on the pancakes
Plans break, plots fold, schemes disembody
I'm amped off the nightmares and an IV full of coffee
They try to stop me and my ability to no avail
Your inavailability of skills ensures failure
I knew the time when the bus drove by, and a cold wind
Ripped the old skin form my frozen frosted hands
Lost it man, it expands past the boundaries
Haunted by the ponderance, I wonder if this'll drown me
Found me off in the woods somewhere, should have left me there
He's a trade off for needing a breath of fresh air

I got mac heads ready to establish the cultivation of the barren
So I brought the creation, my brothers activating civilness
See, this ain't no high school shit, the Spectrum is straight livin' this
I'm on a roll like pastry, a straight line about to make mine
Patience is Hell cause it'll take time
Break spine, the lone wall's crackin'
I came too far for slackin' so the factory is happenin'

Camouflage dreams sabotage me
Any means, many things activate, circulate around green
Not the calling, niggas they swallow pharmaceutical
My blue collar suitable verbal points isn't shootable
They can take pitch black boons and meditation
Temptation and lust, overcoming Theolonius
Monkey must need classes on jungle etiquette
You rub me wrong, swinging on ropes of counterfeit
Mentalist, gorilla fish, Che Guevera hips
The over-ground terrorist reminiscent of this
Assault trooper star domain be outshining
I rainin' Uvula stranglin' Hymen
What kind of density is you claimin'?
Civilized, what, Runnin' up on some blind slavemen
Flagrant hell-bent child of entertainment
Color of pavement, enragin' breakin' and makin'
I hold the terror, extravagant paranoia
Permeate and never corrupt this trend-setter
So you know me, point out traits that spell fake
Delusional snake sever, staggering back peddla

[Hook]
Ease back, catch a breath of fresh air, kid
Ease back and catch a breath, kid; ease the fuck back
Ease back, catch a breath of fresh air, kid
Ease back and catch a breath, kid; ease the fuck back

[Verse 2]
Now...
After we inject a few hundred CCs of these
MCs will hand over all their locks and keys
My lyric philosophy's like Socrates
Date back past pre-cry before there was any rappers
Crates and wax I'm waitin' to relax information
On tracks like faxes, show you I'm anti-wackness
As I spin on my axis
I watch you get caught and fall from a lack of practice
Man your whole plan was a joke, I revoke your molasses
Until the smoke passes, lay face-down on the floor
Everybody look for something more but it's all been done before
I open a new door and welcome you to explore
My land of four season where there's gun stores for many reasons
My lyric teaches, leaves legions upon completion
Flex to reach my apex and stay vexed like some New York niggas
Upset cause my checks need more figures
So I rhyme to re-tour while drinking export liquor with your bitch nigga

Bitch you say goodbye to me tonight
But still be mad, fucking' music left to write
I used to fall asleep with the pen in my hand
Now I'm finnin' to stand on top of the planet and do damage
Substantiated, I contemplate it to be creative
But never fake it, so I never be overrated
I gotta make, cause my babies need their lunch
So I'mma do what I must so they achieve their wants

[Hook]
Ease back, catch a breath of fresh air, kid
Ease back and catch a breath, kid; ease the fuck back
Ease back, catch a breath of fresh air, kid
Ease back and catch a breath, kid; ease the fuck back
Ease back, catch a breath of fresh air, kid
Ease back and catch a breath, kid; ease the fuck back
Ease back, catch a breath of fresh air, kid
Ease back and catch a breath, kid; ease the fuck...

Let's count the bodies over again
If we could only make the bodies smaller
The size of skulls
We could make a whole plain white with skulls in the moonlight
