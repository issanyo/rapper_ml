[Slug]
I like this, yup
Here we are, not leavin'
Not yet
Still here, still breathin'
Happy Friday, feels like an evenin'

Gotta keep it goin', keep it
Cieling, high touch it if you can touch it
I rush it
I grab this microphone and bust it
You and your friends discuss it
Sit back in the back in your room
Listenin' to me on a friday afternoon
Yeah, 96.3, f 'em
South minneapolis, that's what I'm reppin'
Keep steppin, it's like a blessin'
When I grab this microphone and learn a lesson
Each and every time I'm guessin'
This time the lesson in how to articulate
How to keep it goin' and maybe umm participate
In these lyrics that we bring yup you hear it
And it's fly like a spirit
Do you hear it? atmosphere it
Atmospheric, uh, so sick
Gimmie the microphone, hold my --
Nope. can't curse when it's live
So gimmie that, yup
I keep it goin, been doin it since '85
Used to do it in my basement
Just chillin', hidin', not tryna face it
But now it's like '08, and oh, I'm great
I grab this microphone, no wait, just let me --
Hesitate, can't grab it
It hangs in the air in front of my face, like a rabbit
The easter bunny, ay yo he's so funny!
It's slug from atmosphere, keep it up dummy
I'm like rummy, I got game
I grab this microphone without even sayin' my name
But i'll spell it, tell it
S-L-U-G, who do you be?
Grab that microphone and rock camp snoopy
Nah, I'm jokin', just tryna provoke
A couple a' smiles on the faces of these eggs of these yolks
And maybe if it's broke, maybe not
I'm still hot when I grab the microphone and touch that spot
G-spot, we rock, got you, see?
Clockin' in when it's time to grin
Then I'm clockin' out when it's time to leave
And I'mma go until I can't breathe
See, conceived inside of me is babies
Of lyrics, and you can hear it, maybe
You can see it, maybe
And you can free it, if you had it too
I grab that microphone and pass it to you
They laughin' at you
Uh, offa hennepin, or lexington
Doesn't really matter, yup you better tell a friend
From minneapolis, st. paul
Paint walls, gave all ya'll
A good time, and you can call it a ball
In fact, gave you two! my left and the right one
Gonna grab that microphone and i'll rock it all night, son (petter parker, parker, parker...)
It doesn't matter with "petter parker" on
The boards and I'mma start it and you can applaud
And you can feel it from the back to the front of the room
Each and every time I consume from july to june
But not yet, it's may still
So wait till
We grab the microphone and give you somethin', say skills
That's what we got, we keep it hot
Girls, I got em locked like super lover and casanova
Yup I told ya
Grab the microphone, it's minnesnowta
I roll over ya like a damn boulder
On the highway, here on a friday
Doin' it my way
Why cry baby, they can't where the hell you goin'
But I'mma keep on flowin' till you know it
Till you know it, till you know it
All, I grab it
And you can call me a part time alcoholic
But I'mma stall it
Just tryna fill the wallet, tryna fill the brain
All of the information that it can contain
I mean, I'm like a super-internet highway
Stuck inside of my spine when I start to rhyme
Half the time, it don't even make sense
It doesn't really matter, just as long as them haters get tense
I commence to chill, maybe we can build
Ain't poppin' no pills, f'real
'n you can tell jack or jill
To climb up this hill
And i'll still flip skill
Or you can punch a button to shut me up
Whenever you feel it's time you had enough, man
You got another beat to give me?

My man he got a camera, tryna find an angle
I'm tryna find an angel
Or make a balance
And you can challenge
Grab the microphone, like it's a chalice
Take a sip, uh, take a breath
And know my left, I know the edge
I keep my breath instead of endin' up dead
I keep on goin' from the top of the head
That's that way it goes classic
This beat here, I be the atmos
All I wanna do is grab it
That's how we did it, dagnabbit, damnit
Uh, canned it, you can't understand it, so I overstand it
Hold my hand if you need a little help
From the side for the self
You better know the ledge, and keep it well (peter parker)
Uh, keep it goin' and goin'
Petter parker on the brake, gonna keep me flowin'
Keep it, uh, keep it goin' and goin'
Peter parker on the brake gonna keep me flowin', it goes
I got enough to go around
And the thought takes place underground
Somewhere in the basement
You can face it
Uh, take it, taste of it
Replace it with nothin'
Ain't nothin', all of a sudden
I grab the microphone, push on the button
Turn me up and damn, I'm in your headphones
Keep goin' till I'm inside the dead zone
Get my dead mic on my head right
Sip another red stripe
Get that lead pipe
Because you a, what, what they call it?
You need a switch blade?
You trick made
Now I don't know where the beat left, but I still grab it
Uh, come to the breath, it's all gone
I got another song inside of the head
I go long, all night long
I'm runnin' outta breath over here
Cause this beat is fast, my name is atmosphere
I rock slow beats, yeah you know me
Slow jams, get with the program
Hold my hand, damn

They say that slug sold out
That's not the message, it's a positive thing
See if you can try to catch it
I throw it in the air and if you care you can grab it
Tryna balance out the tables, and make a habit of it
This type a' stuff on the radio air waves
Tryna be brave, because I really care, brave
I wanna give you everything that you need
But I need a little space so I can climb inside the seed
Here, B96 got me playin'
It's kind of an anomaly
What you want from me, an apology?
Naw brother, I'm tryna get this goin' so we can discover each other
And maybe you'll be the next one on the waves
Or maybe you'll be doin' it for you and your braves
And I gave you everything I had to give
I had to keep it positive
Because your guy called up and said
Make the people smile, make it feel like a party
I'mma do my best, I'm just one dude so hardly can much be done
I grab this mic to have some fun
And keep it all on the one
Don't need a gun
I got the mental, I got the physical, and the spiritual
Here we go, if you can hear it, yo
Well put your hand in the air like you don't care
Try to touch the rafter it's right there
We keep it goin' like this
I'm like neon on a (?) brick wall
I keep it sick, y'all
It's that pitiful flow
From that kid you all know
Right offa uptown
Where the hell you wanna get down?
South minneapolis where I used to reside
In fact, no where I still reside
And I will until the day I die
I will apply myself to everything that's up in your sky
So look up at the clouds and feel me
You feel me? you see me? you hear me?
I drill these lyrics inside of your head until I'm dead
And that's all he had to say and that's all that he said
But, he said a little bit more
Tryin' to ensure each and every person could feel it cause it's pure
Out here, where are we? edina?
Well I be the rhymer
Come through and give you two times or three times
A couple of beats, I keep it complete
And keep goin' till I'm layin' on the concrete
I keep it on. neat, right?
Fey, we do it this way
That's how we gotta keep it movin' if you hear what we say
Check me out, on the in and on the out
Tryna show you what it's really all about
Underground or mainstream
We all on the same team
We all bleed the same blood
Wanna keep it going
Peace! my name's slug
