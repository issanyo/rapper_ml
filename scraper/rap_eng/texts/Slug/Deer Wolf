[Intro: Voice Samples]
Just seven days
Just seven days
Seven summers old lovely Lyca told

[Verse 1: Slug]
I know a lot of people but not many that I trust
And outta those I trust not many I would touch
They say I talk in circles but I write it line by line
And if I don't really know you I'ma lie and say I'm fine
I spit rhymes hoping that someone who thinks like me
Relates to the emotions interlocked within the psyche
Spit rhymes to catch chicks and catch hope
And catch the ear of that kid who says 'damn that shit is dope' (damn that shit is dope)
Not to mention I love the attention
Went from hidin' in the boxcars to drivin' the engine
And I sit in the same chair under the same light
Around the same time of night when I write
Probably will for life
Twenty-five and I ain't gettin' any younger
Living to survive can you spare a penny brother?
Now in the name of all world wide Rhymesayers
I'ma drive past King park and spray the soccer players

[Chorus: Slug & Voice Sample]
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
Let thy moon arise while I close my eyes

[Verse 2: Slug]
Finally finalize the line by line of tryin' to climb in between your minds thighs
Self esteem, watch it grow like mold
Watch the loads it holds, as the soul unfolds
Track my faith as I wade through a pack a day
Have to wait call me back next Saturday
Pass the steak I'ma about to stick this vampire
Touch the heart and lay the carcass on the campfire
Burn baby burn and take your cents with ya
If the shoe don't fit ya remove it to lose the business
Get the car started warm it up for the journey
Wake up abuse, and shake of the blues
And make stops to fill the tank, stops to urinate
Stops to meditate and let the thoughts resonate
Stops to celebrate, stops just for heavens sake
Stops in an attempt to take the bent shit and get it straight
The asthma regulates the breath control
So thanks for buyin' the tapes and eat your vegetables
Eh yo I write it for me, and if you like it that's love
And if you don't that's life, 'cause life don't like Slug

[Chorus: Slug & Voice Sample]
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
Let thy moon arise while I close my eyes

[Verse 3: Slug]
Its the super unleaded, embedded within my head trips
Kept it in check with the skeptics and the essence
When it festers, infection fills with fluid
Apply the pressure it bursts to satisfy the thirst
20/20 sight so I got no excuse
My soul is broken loose, from over use
Tell me who can hold the noose, while I make certain it fits me
Judgement first impression naturally shifty
Each one tried to teach one when it begun
Struggling for freedom, tryin' to build a kingdom
Now your sippin' Seagrams tryin' to fix a threesome
Between you your girl and that freak with the Nissan
Wheels keep spinnin', accelerator sticks
So sugar up the coffee, and celophane your dick
And lace the spliff, but make sure that dosage is right
'Cause life's a bitch (life's a bitch) and I'ma hold it tight

[Outro: Slug & Voice Sample]
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?
Let thy moon arise while I close my eyes
