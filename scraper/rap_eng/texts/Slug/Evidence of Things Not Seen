[Verse 1: Sep Sev Sev Two]
Your thoughts don't really matter
Cause your actions don't follow
What you do don't matter
Cause you don't see tomorrow
I don't know you that well
But I know about your rep
I had to leave the room cause you was too consumed with meth
I salted the steps
Now there's no excuse for slippin'
Put away all the toys
Try to avoid trippin'
Your voice is different, is it really you talkin'?
Change the subject
Too often I'm kickin' dialogue with puppets
I simply wear a smile
Play the role of dum-dum
Mr. Nice Guy
Mr. Lie-'bout-where-I-come-from
Humble
The type you either love or disrespect
Defense mech never even perceived me as a threat
Guilty
But still I let the real me through once in a while
To put a smile on the face of those that feel me
Acknowledge this game that's played
Cause if you don't, you [?]
And we'll be quick to read your page
How'd you find me?
C'mon, you didn't, I found you
Used careful, strategic position to surround you
I got skills, got steam, got heart, got team
The true advantage is the evidence of things not seen

[Hook]
You don't see if you only see what you're allowed to see
You don't see if you only see what you're allowed to see
You don't see if you only see what you're allowed to see
Why don't you eyeball your info cause your motives keep crowding me
You don't see if you only see what you're allowed to see
You don't see if you only see what you're allowed to see
You don't see if you only see what you're allowed to see
C'mon and eyeball your info cause your motives keep crowding me

[Verse 2: Pat Juba]
We set the scene Monday, vibin' on A.D
Clearly I recollect data be percept
Mad emotion move irate
Irrational [?] following
Customer's violation blazed the eighth just before
A [?] fatigue dungarees askin' questions
About size, texture, color, packin'
Paternal 6 inch patrol nonchalantly
So he think but bluntly
And actual frontin'
My personal' is try to [?] again and raise supporters
In a surplus with borders
Mega hawk in my frame with twin mirrors
I can't afford this
My comfortable levels have been distorted
My [?]
[?], a veteran of [?] amnesia
Seize the cranial region, fuck you I'm leavin'
The color issue
Overexposed plus glamorized
Demagnetized, to enforce the iller lies
Like "I'm not racist" but the actions [?]
Nice, you're Minnesota, but it's still about skin
Should I (a) bomb the place, C4 from my cousin
The aura buzzin'
Or (b) terrorize the plumbin'
Or saturate the surface with flyers to serve justice
Nervous of how to hit him with truth, for street service
I got the SKS
Assault bless your chest, we're mental
A future revolu' comin' out

[Hook]
You don't see if you only see what you're allowed to see
You don't see if you only see what you're allowed to see
You don't see if you only see what you're allowed to see
Why don't you eyeball your info cause your motives keep crowding me
You don't see if you only see what you're allowed to see
You don't see if you only see what you're allowed to see
You don't see if you only see what you're allowed to see
C'mon and eyeball your info cause your motives keep crowding me

[Verse 3: General Woundwart]
Patiently I'm waitin' in the brush, ready to destruct
A hook-nosed scoundrel, slice his throat on the down-low
I see the platoon steppin' through the marsh
Lights only supplied by the moon and the stars
It's pitch dark
Glowin' is the red of the eyes of the antagonists
B52s and battleships
I'm makin' [?]
I'm trackin' with my scanner, checkin' out my periphery
I hope that my commander's somewhere lookin', detectin' me
Infrared scopes right next to me
I drop my head to my lap and start breathin' heavily
(Heavy breathing)
As the steps get closer
My limbs get colder
I start to lose my composure
It's over
That's what I'm feelin'
I've been defeated
I'm sittin' in my own feces
Thinkin' of defense
The sequence runnin' through my mind at the time of the sticky situation
Is I don't want to taste gun shell and casings
So I'mma do what I have to do
I'm not a match for you
So I won't try to [?] you
Bag the tool, cause I don't want to get my life trashed
Call me a coward, cause I'm throwin' up the white flag

[Outro]
My eyes are open, and I don't like what I see
My eyes are open, and I don't like what I see
My eyes are open, and I don't like what I see
