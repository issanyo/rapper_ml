[Intro: Talib Kweli]
Eh, it's Ragu nigga
Put it on your pasta like Prego
Because it's in there, Prego sauce
I said it's in there, Prego sauce
I said it's in there

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
People want me to preach cause that's where heaven begin
People want me to teach, unless the lesson's for them
This message is in the form of a song I had to arrange it
You bangin' it through the speakers for maximum entertainment
Wait a minute, step back a bit
I highly doubt that your perception is accurate
My conception immaculate

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
You know it's in there
Ayo, we out here
And if the party going on you know we in there
I'm so sincere
Quit your talk about 'I've been here'
Way before he showed up, let's get clear
Ayo, we out here
And if the party going on you know we in there
I'm so sincere

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
I don't really know where I'm going, but where I have been
Everybody double as predators or assassins
It's tragic how we love this life, fatal attraction
A metaphor like Reservoir Dogs I'm like a master
You make me wanna cut off my ear the way you rappin'
The black van Gogh to pick up the ones active
In the movement, got 'em using every drug you can imagine
Dyin' like diabetics who diet without the saccharine
That tale thinking is sweet, until it happen
Standing ovation on the street they on their feet
When the shooters get to clapping
5 star forest, the murder go
The fat lady singing in curtain closed
My getaway car is convertible, I'm choppin' the top off
This rap dudes faker than knock-offs

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
Because we in there
Ayo, we out here
And if the party going on you know we in there
I'm so sincere
Quit talkin' about 'I've been here'
Way before he showed up, let's get clear
Ayo, we out here
And if the  party going on you know we in there
I'm so sincere

[Verse 3: Pharoahe Monch]
Sling lingo, watch the thing go fall, new single, bingo
Ringo Starr, more Pringles
Which leads to more dips
Adrian Peterson all day, more whips
Seen it before like d√©ja-vu, so sincere
Rooftops, skylines, poolside swim wear, we in here
I'm whisperin' in Slim's ear like "I can be your hero"
Indie 5-0-0 see the reason is [?] the seasoning
Always show love, never deceiving them
He can get my vote, we believe in him
He can get it, I got it, it mean exotic
2 seated the exact color is hypnotic, in fact
Triptronic, sit back
Sit on to the shack, shit's honored, it's rap
It's chronic, automatic, it's organic

[Bridge (x5)]
I said it's in there, I said it's in there
I said it's in there, I said it's in there
I said it's in there

[Verse 4: Slug]
I said it's in there like the love that's in the air
Living for our life, got something to share
Still tryna build, progress, I don't regress
Cut through the BS
Speak through the beak of a phoenix
Fly, schemin' on the sadness
My language dangerous, vandal, damage
Dismantle, break free from the baggage
Expand across the planet's canvas
Catch the buck with the lid on the jar
Or hold it in your hand, so you can pick it apart
If you a listen at heart, you would be liftin' your guard
Grew a couple of fins
Try to swim with the sharks
The worth ain't based on if the dogs chase it
Bark till you barkin' yourself out the basement
Spread the word, my voice is spacious
Taste the Prego
It's in there
And now you pregnant

[Hook]
