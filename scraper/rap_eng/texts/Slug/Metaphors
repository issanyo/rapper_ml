Inhale, the vacuum sucks up dirt and dust in a motion making
Up the particles to make a potent potion
Until I spray them out in a pattern, no one understands
Comprehension; it's the greatest invention by man
Splitting into separate piles sending down different conveyors
Constructing one long line pleasing to the sequence sentence sayers
"Boom-click, click-boom-click"
My vacuum spits phonetics that makes the sound walls sick
Pleasing to the nostrils, even allergists will commend
You love my offerings from my vacuum from start to end

Monday started off humble, passed fumbling
Shaky, nervous like a stomach, like a practice
Tuesday/Wednesday in stride sequence to reach potential
Breathe in dental, keeping focus is essential
Thursday passed observing the foreplay of the first day
Looking at the weekend like "my whore is thirsty"
You bounce up wide-eyed
Friday/Saturday cut loose, climb inside the intenseness
It's the vibe that I'm presented
My secret heaven; reach the week's peek at the stroke
Sunday, time to relax while I bask in the afterglow

Floating in all the splendor, traveling towards the way, get away
The currents undried, all currents being rivaled
"Get your hands out of his mouth, now he's damned!"
Cut off from his hands and feet
Now your board's oxygen and the land it breathes
Energy, the energy welling up; impossible to breed
And still the land is choking, and what's with all these bodies
Floating and sinking? You know you're all washed up
The more I think about it he should've saw it coming
Well man will harness all resources for deluded cause
The cost is unmeasurable by man and unrepayable to the list

I-I-If I'd have only paid it more attention and stood there then...
Tears won't bring back the everywhere we went
That's the fear choking and he's, ohhh mannn...
World to me will never be the same, I'll forget all those times
It made the sunshine, but the grownups say "everything'll be fine"
It would never d-d-d, only change can grow again in our backyard
Through my shoe box and the strawberry plants
