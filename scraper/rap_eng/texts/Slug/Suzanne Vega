I was sitting at the stoplight
In my car rolled down the windows
When this driver pulled on side of me
And offered me some indo
I told her that I didn't smoke
But I thanked her for the offer
I thought I might just ask her name
Instead I made a left

(Murs)
On 3rd and La Cienega
Can't front I was into her
She offered me a blunt
Damn I wish I smoked Indica
Cause I remembered her
From the center of Beverly, she was heavenly
Still on my mind from a while back
She had a smile that shook the clouds off the sun
A set of lovely lips made me fumble my tongue
Hair up in a bun, up under a cap
She was a down low beauty, see I like 'em like that
She kept it on the low, but high enough to see
She made me feel special, like she did it all for me
Not much up top, I would say about a B
Her pants hugged her frame, made me want to know her name
But I've never been the type to step up and spit game
In a mall full of women that were begging for attention
Fake eyes, fake tits, fake hair extensions
She walked through my dreams
Then she cut through the seams

My name is Sluggo
I live on the 7th floor
I live upstairs from you
I'm the one you try to ignore
If you hear music late at night
Some kind of party
Some kind of life
Just don't call the cops on me
Girl come up stairs and talk to me
She got the facial pierceing
Half done sleeve work
Change cashed in, reaction knee-jerk
Driver control functional alcholic
The barbie doll skirt
Original flirt
She go chama, chama, chama
Chameleon hair colors
Machete pesonality, carry a pair cutter
Talk a lot of shit
Walk like an Egyptian
Loves to sleep with no favorite position
Bout 5'6, nice lips
Make her life hips
Tough soul, she fuck slow but fight quick
Eyeball daggers, walk with a swagger
I know you got troubles but it don't really matter
From what I gather
We should verse
Let's place bets to see who's gonna move first
Leisurely come speak to me
See life is like a song can you keep the beat
It goes

Duh duh duh da duh da
Duh duh duh da duh da
Duh duh duh da duh da
Duh duh duh da duh da
Duh duh duh da duh da
Duh duh duh da duh da
Duh duh duh da duh da

Instead I made a left
