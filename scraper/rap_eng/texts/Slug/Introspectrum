Cool like, we're shedding the blood on turntables
Flammable burn ankles, split a neck for rocking wood cables
Door knockers, some solid gold tables
Missing like Jimmy Hoffa in Bermuda Triangle
Triangular danger in the form of Mic angular
Try coastal strangla', wild niggas, I'm tamin' ya'
Namin' ya, claimin' ya spot, aggression
Aim it at your cranial piece, my weapon
Cock back, relax to ease back off a cliff, professional fall off, specialist, world eclipse. Now peep this
The tunnel vision's narrowin'
Veins collapsed from Queens using heroin
Things I used to know, trippin' at clubs and hail blow
Real slow, non-meltin' snow, freeze frame, insane, this freak show
What the hell inside of ya? Skinny as fuck, ridin' a bike, human spider, limbs broke off. Lookin' like sticks in campfires
Verbal Messiah, sire, outsider
Higher than last night's fist fights, crack pipes
I'm chillin' on old sage with moves in sight

(Verse 2 [Slug])
Lets bring your alter ego to a stand still-stand still
Land filled with faulty people keep the stride strong
Pride gone, the salt and evil kill the taste buds-taste buds
I make floods to halt the feeble paths of pythons
Icons that you elected don't deserve it-deserve it
Services were rejected I'm not buyin it
I'm trying to grip your pretentious ways of civilized-civil lies
But shit if i'ma sweep the deck on your pirate ship
The advil with the brandy keep the thoughts deep-thoughts deep
Awake regulated but still I lost sleep
The empowerment is faulty cause the talk's cheap-Talks cheap
Intrigued by the taste but what'll it cost me

Got weak because you're fear bit and held tight-held tight
Did for self, disregard someone else fight
Underestimated the supply, and the shelf life-shelf life
Left your whole shit alone. It didn't smell right
It felt right I assume that's why you cling to- cling to
Ordinary motivates to make me bring you-bring you
