[Verse 1: Grieves]
We used to fly around the world in a cardboard box
Now you're waiting for the bus trying to fit in with the flock
Different socks, on one hand you've got a wild imagination
And on the other, is man against the clock
It never stops, we used to look up at the clouds
And see shapes now the only thing we see in 'em is rain, it's not the same
Cause after all the giant dragons disappeared
The only battle left to fight was with your chains, cut 'em loose
I liked it better when our dreams were real
We respected what it was to feel
Nobody ever put a limit on the things that that made the littlest of kings
Seem strong enough to cut through steel, grip the wheel
It's a windy little road you paved
It's a shame you had to lose that light
Cause if it wasn't for the blanket fort walls and the bumps in the night
You'd be nothing but a string without a kite

[Chorus: Grieves]
You're not the astronaut you used to be
Ain't it shame that you couldn't keep the starlight in your eyes?
You're not the hero that you used to be
Fading away until you're falling out the sky

[Verse 2: Grieves]
We used to sail around the world in a porcelain tub
Now we fill it to the brim and try to wash away the mud, it isn't us
In one world you got a wide-eyed adventure in the other
Is a person giving up, it never jumps
We used to play connect the dots with the stars
Now we try to make a connection in bars, it's getting hard
Cause after every little planet's been exploded
It's impossible to find out where you are, I take it home
I miss the feeling of a brand-new start
What it meant to be a child at heart
No matter how it was explained it always felt like if
I wanted to I could've built a city in my own backyard, disembark
You don't have to be a kid to believe or see potential in a pile of leaves
If it wasn't for them deep sea dives
Or the whisper from the trees you'd be
Nothing but a want without a need

[Chorus]
You're not the astronaut you used to be
Ain't it shame that you couldn't keep the starlight in your eyes?
You're not the hero that you used to be
Fading away until you're falling out the sky

[Verse 3: Slug]
I remember you were stuck in a half-empty cup
You studied the sun like it was meant to touch, got to clutch
It's not enough to escape like the duck's
Cause they always come back to the muck
Struggle from a brush with luck so we could judge your guts like
"You still on that such and such?"
They can cut the budget but the puppet struts
On two crutches over drums that rush like busted nuts
It's too much now, you want to strike like
The light without the thunder, wonder whatcha doing uptown
You delivering nothing but love
But can't seem to catch a dream when fishing from up above
I don't believe that there's a bad bet
Cause everybody's gonna breathe that last breath
But the things you write, got wings for life
It's the freedom flight, that's how we sleep at night

[Chorus]
You're not the astronaut you used to be
Ain't it shame that you couldn't keep the starlight in your eyes?
You're not the hero that you used to be
Fading away until you're falling out the sky
