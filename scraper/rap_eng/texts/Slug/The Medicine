Blame it on the medicine…
Take no prisoners
Minnesota winter ghost to Christmas
Wrote it printed in an open wish list
Blow a kiss and don’t show your business
Past the deadline
Bread the enzymes
Capture the outline
If their heads bind I
Guess it’s bout time
Get of the get mine
And make this crowd climb
Grab grenades with your
Coke spoon pin and your plastic face
The cavalcades ass will have to wait
Cause all that happy ever after Was the last decade
The golden days of, control the stage
And now they hold they face
The soldiers came home from home invade
And the old brigade just got old and grey
When life was younger, dive the dumpster to survive the suffer
Dead in the gutter, surprise the buzzards
Now you wanna front like you a violent fucker
Bent from the pressure, entered the effort
Went for the adventure
Left over pepper burns forever
Render the measures then return to sender

Skulls hype and burning mics
It gets no better, no it gets no better
The feel is kids turn out the lights
Cause I hate half steppers and I ain't your Shepard

Bust your rhymes
While I bust your fact
