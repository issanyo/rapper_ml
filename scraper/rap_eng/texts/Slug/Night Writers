[Intro: Blueprint]
Yeah
Fly shit
Uh huh

[Verse 1: Blueprint]
I wrote my first rhyme at school on a Saturday
Stuck there for half a day all because I can't behave
Already upset 'cause I was up so early
With other show outs that showed up at 7:30
To make matters worse, we had to turn in an assignment
Now what we did wrong, so I decided I would rhyme it
That's when my mind went, time started flying
Suddenly I was done and wondered where all the time went
My first rhyme, I never thought I was headed
Anywhere until my teacher cracked a smile when he read it
Back then, that little validation got me so amped
'Til now I travel 'round the nation rocking for fans
Who I wax and ask when my next book coming out
Amazed in many ways on what my pen's brought about
Humble beginnings but now I get to speak it with clout
'Cause my name ring bells like schools letting out

[Chorus]
"I write in the night to bring truth to the light"
"S-s-sacrifice things like no sleep"
"Stayed up late to write some rhymes to some rhythms"
"See, with the pen I'm extreme"
"I write in the night to bring truth to the light"
"S-s-sacrifice things like no sleep"
"I-I write it down and I watch it blow up"
"We the night writers"

[Verse 2: Slug]
Wifey says I get cold and icy
Like I might be destressed if I don't write nightly
Turn a couple pages in my psyche, maybe I be understood
I'm not allowed to put a price upon the livelihood
I tapped the buttons 'til the sun is coming up
And tryna glimpse through these basement windows
Ground level, 26 symbols
A keyboard, a pencil, send some smoke signals
Gotta write it all the way instead of throw it all away
'Cause I don't know no other way, okay?
Whether or not any whoever heard the verse won't sway
On how I measure giving worth to these words today
It's what it takes to escape and put my mind right
Let the lightning strike or go linear line for line
And even when there ain't a limelight I might
Still write rhymes about writing these rhymes

[Chorus]
"I write in the night to bring truth to the light"
"S-s-sacrifice things like no sleep"
"Stayed up late to write some rhymes to some rhythms"
"See, with the pen I'm extreme"
"I write in the night to bring truth to the light"
"S-s-sacrifice things like no sleep"
"I-I write it down and I watch it blow up"
"We the night writers"

[Verse 3: Wordsworth]
It's like a maze how these lines are shaped to design
Graduated from college writing papers and rhymes
African Studies got an A in, people, power, and politics
Then followed it with grad school at the U on a scholarship
5 vowels, 26 letters, 21 consonants
Played in 196 countries on 7 continents
Bright nights, my mind's a night light, the beats resume the boom
My window from how the light's bright, it's like room's a moon
I assume you goons buffoons, you meet your doom you're soon
In a tomb like old westerns meet at salloons at noon
You brought a knife to a gunfight, we the night writers
I'm an assault rifle, you a knife fighter
I'm a laptop, you a typewriter
Against us with highlighters you couldn't write brighter
You never edit mine, I better so nevermind
Every line I got credit for got me in good credit line

[Chorus]
"I write in the night to bring truth to the light"
"S-s-sacrifice things like no sleep"
"Stayed up late to write some rhymes to some rhythms"
"See, with the pen I'm extreme"
"I write in the night to bring truth to the light"
"S-s-sacrifice things like no sleep"
"I-I write it down and I watch it blow up"
"We the night writers"
