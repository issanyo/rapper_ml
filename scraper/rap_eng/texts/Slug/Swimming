Yeah

I'm going swimming (ooh)
Yeah (ooh)
Can I swim, can I swim, you know I'm swimming (ooh)
Yeah I'm cool

Hey, hot ass day, but the girl got a pool
She be wet all over but I'm keepin' it cool
Got my swim trunks on and I'm ready to rock
I ain't even gotta ask her pops

I'm going swimming (come on)
Yeah. (come on)
Can I swim, can I swim, you know I'm swimming (come on)
Yeah. I'm cool

The sun beatin' on my head
Got me up and awake
So girl you and I should go jump in the lake
I know you swim, you might be pro
I can tell how you built that you probably float

I'm going swimming (come on)
Yeah. (come on)
Can I swim, can I swim, you know I'm swimming (come on)
Yeah. I'm cool

I love flash floods, water up to the shins
I ain't afraid to eat a half hour 'fore I swim
You'll get yours girl, now stay in the water
Don't trip, I can hold my breath for hours

I'm going swimming (come on)
Yeah. (come on)
Can I swim, can I swim, you know I'm swimming (come on)
Yeah. I'm cool

Ooh, girl, wan' see you get soggy
Jump in the swamp 'n paddle like a doggy
Grabbin' on the lactose while I do the backstroke
Mommy, you can get it like a bad joke

Happy as a dog gettin' in from the cold
Ya gotta keep that boy afloat
Momma him goin'
Left, right, left, right, left, right

Happy as a cat gettin' in from the cold
Ya gotta keep that girl afloat
Gotta hear him goin'
Left, right, left, right, left, right. (I'm cool)

I don't even know why you would wanna be dry
Wikipedia my name, I'm a quality guy
So pardon me, the shark in me
Is trying to start the party, and part the sea

I'm going swimming (come on)
Yeah. (come on)
Can I swim, can I swim, you know I'm swimming (come on)
Yeah. I'm cool

I never ever ever ride a speed boat
Feel like an ocean when I'm on the weed smoke
Especially when I'm over on the east coast
Hurricane, hurricane, let my feet soak

I'm going swimming (come on)
Yeah. (come on)
Can I swim, can I swim, you know I'm swimming (come on)
Yeah. I'm so cool

I'm swimmin' though, and the women know
You can find me over there at the fishin' hole
Hanging out with the little homie in that boat
I'm like a rain storm, I make the rivers grow

I'm going swimming (come on)
Yeah. (come on)
Can I swim, can I swim, you know I'm swimming (come on)
Yeah. I'm cool

Uh, I'm a missions for the ripest
I'ma get my feelin' till I've had enough to digest
And she grabbin' on me like it was a mic check
Fuck it, I'ma jump without a life vest

Happy as a dog gettin' in from the cold
Ya gotta keep that boy afloat
Momma him goin'
Left, right, left, right, left, right

Happy as a cat gettin' in from the cold
Ya gotta keep that girl afloat
Gotta hear him goin'
Left, right, left, right, left, right

Shut up
All the girl love me, I'm so fly
Chunkin' up the dudes as the player slide by
It's on when I catch her mind's eye
She dragged me to the room
Can I get a high five?

Everyone knows that she's ready
My brother's gonna take that hoe
Everyone knows that she's ready
My brother's gonna take that hoe
Everyone knows that she's ready
My brother's gonna take that hoe
