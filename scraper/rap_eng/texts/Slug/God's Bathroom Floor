[Intro]
Head, pressure, senses, clutch
Date, divinity, wouldn't, fuck
Touched, hazy, God, change
Rush, floor, life, veins
Head, pressure, senses, clutch
Date, divinity, wouldn't, fuck
Touched, hazy, God, change
Rush, floor, life, veins

[Chorus]
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins

[Verse 1]
It goes one for the cannabis, and two for your Dianetics
Three for your reasoning, and four for those that try to get it
Five for your love, and six for the stress
And seven for the day that I climbed into this mess

[Chorus]
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins

[Verse 2]
I'm catching ulcers from the childproof lighters
And all these fine-tooth biters that keep the wires in my head tighter
I'm tired out by the distances achieved walking in my sleep
Floors got shifted since the high, got a tad too deep
Ask dad to keep cool, I'll call him back as soon as I resume normal
And get out of this bathroom
And call management to seek some reimbursement
For the nerve endings that burnt from the first hits

[Chorus]
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins

[Verse 3]
So fuck needles, fuck smoke
Fuck lines that make the sinus choke
Fuck chasers, trails, fuck raves and rails
Fuck hangovers, fuck hallucinations
Regurgitations, mandatory sentences and UA tracing
Blind my insight and dull the common sense
Give me inhibition, kill the superstition and the confidence
Built a tolerance, now it's more that I consume it
When it boards up my room, the world's whores will croon in unison
Unify the eulogy, autopsy pages read euthanasia, i.e. irony
But here I be within a pool of my drool
Sedated, windows dilated, comatose, life overdose
Tell Jacob Miles to keep it wild style
I'll promise I'll smile
And check the floor, God's got nice tile
Tell Jacob Miles to keep that shit wild style
And I'll smile
And check the floor, God's got nice tile

[Chorus]
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins

Head, pressure, senses, clutched
Date, divinity, wouldn't, fuck
Touched, hazy, God, change
Rush, floor, life
