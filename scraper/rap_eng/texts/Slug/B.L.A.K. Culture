It means a lot for brothers like me to be successful
Handling business managing things I know that's stressful
Providing intellect and guidance
Throughout the mental violence
In the industry nothing is what its meant to be
I calculate facts by visual prospect
Common sense in me is amiss that's where all my context
Is fully established its a ballad for me to fall
Fuck record ratings Rhymesayers can do it all
We install wisdom in the product before we let it go
And any other bullshit is hypothetical
So i'm inscribed in music to keep your vibe
In lyrics over fat tracks A.N.T. be providing
So hide when you see these twin cities rollin
Appear on the spot with a bottle of Arizona
Cooling out relaxing holding the wall
And hand on my balls, never showing typical flaws

Life, love, stress, and setbacks
Life, love, stress, and setbacks
Life, love, stress, and setbacks
For those trying to breathe show me where your heads at
Life, love, stress, and setbacks
Life, love, stress, and setbacks
Life, love, stress, and setbacks
For those trying to breathe show me where your heads at

Arise daily to the sun rays and hear about gun sprays
On television children or Montel Williams
I be in display as cavities in the community
Cops they want to ruin me
What the fuck can they do to me
No longer hustling to make a fast dollar
God granted me talent now I use it to rock
A microphone in a studio with the A.N.T
Fuck the people who think i'm slacking
Cause that's the way it be
Sometimes i'm thinking to myself should I face it
Black people can only do sports and entertainment
But fuck that because that's a low life's model
Even though the twin don't got the problems of Chicago
But who wants that shit brothers would sense holy
Cause black culture is more than selling drugs and house parties
Really we don't got no culture
To compare to them from Africa
Don't even like black Americans

Speak for Your Mind (cuts)

I'm chilling' at the crib drinking iced tea
Then my cousin then my cousin knowledge emcee
Calls up to invite me
To do a freestyle tape
Stress is in the crates
While we grab the microphone and blast skills we demonstrate
This is how its done children of David's sons
Trying to put their family piece together to make it one
So I vibe and strive when pressure becomes applied
To the self esteem seems that wealth is just a dream
But I know I'm able so I refuse to let the day go
But without progress shits painless
So watch stress I know I got talent to do this
So maybe later on I be a collegiate student
Illegal movement is not the life I want to lead
Just because children from all races are suffering from greed
Love my seed so I feed on wisdom it takes the ball to
So we never falter, in black culture

Respect that
