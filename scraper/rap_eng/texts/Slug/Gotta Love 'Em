[Sample from Dante's Inferno]
Blind like one whom sleep comes over in a swoon...
I stumbled into darkness and went down

[Introduction: Eyedea & Slug]
Enter his head...Enter his head...
Enter his head...Enter...
This is not an entrance
Enter his head....Enter his head
This is not an entrance

[Eyedea]
Enter his head, the doorman guards an entrance
The floor plan tore and all that's left is carpet remnants
'Round here you won't find a single spark of interest
Only a cart of vintage comics and a chronic heart condition

[Slug]
The incision was made...Dig a grave
For the dim vision brave, that couldn't make the grade
Stick him quick, give 'em back to the beginning
And explain how the weak frame snapped from the collision

[Eyedea]
Wanted Harvard, Princeton, to Yale
But found a wound up target pigeon for sale
That fell just below his two cents as a star position
With the sharpest vision of hell
This nuisance clutched his soul with ruthless artistic vision
To move up to grow up beyond his art bird prison

[Slug]
He's the type of guys that likes to believe in lies
His head is filled with space so there's stars inside his eyes
He's quick to kick the game if the listener's a she
Someday we'll see him get consumed by his fantasies
He used to be a friend, but now he's just a shell
Another zombie walking 'round, we manifesting his own hell
And if he worried 'bout himself, and left the rest alone
Maybe then he'd find some focus for this mess inside his home

[Eyedea]
And the whole world looks different from the back of a van
No one's here to scold him so he acts like a man
Practiced his stance while the waves on the shore crashed
He'd splash, dampers his feet as they'd laugh at the sand

[Slug: Hook] x2
People, gotta love 'em, can't live with them, can't die with 'em
Just sit back, analyze and try an figure where I fit in
They call me hypocrite, they call me arrogant
But﻿ when they call I'm not around and they wonder where I went...

[Slug]
And when the lights come on, the ghosts are all gone
I sit in my chair and say a toast for yesterdays
When the power goes out, I close my mouth
And dream about tomorrow where I'll find my anyways

[Eyedea]
And he's learned how to put tin foil in microwaves
And simultaneously change the wind shield wiper blades
I watched the pimps walk proud in the avenue expo
And the whole channel reminds me of an after school special

[Slug]
Where, she's the type of girl that stays mad at the world
Trying to find a fossil inside an empty bottle
Used to be a love, on the way to being loathed
They lay down to sleep and they keep on all their clothes, it goes...

[Slug: Hook] x2
People, gotta love 'em, can't live with them, can't die with 'em
Just sit back, analyze and try an figure where I fit in
They call me hypocrite, they call me arrogant
But﻿ when they call I'm not around and they wonder where I went...

[Slug]
And the beautiful ones look at the blind lake bold
It's hard to keep control when the smile takes hold
When I walk down the plank, ain't nobody whistling
I drink the water before I start fishin'

[Eyedea]
I drink the water before I start to fish in it
