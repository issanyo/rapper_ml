[Sample]
If I could be close it all and all
If I could be close to it all

[Verse 1: Slug]
Run like a cop on the run
Like a gun go kick
Heartbeat like a drum
Snare give a shit about the one
No one got two without a little bit of some
Speak up now, tall talk
Climb the walls, escape all the chalk
You don't doubt, there's now doubt about it
You 'bout it, you kept your surroundings surrounded
That's why you gotta itch that scratch
Like you did it wrong in a past life
But the pigs fly and if you don't act right
You get smacked with a fist full of flashlight
Might capsize but it won't sink
You got baptized in your own sink
Trying to figure out how to twist and shout
Looking like you took a brick to the mouth
Start a fire and stare at the auburn
Irritate a layer underneath the armor
Turned up higher than the recommended volume
The world's a disco ball in your ballroom
Ascension, trend with the sponsors
Pray to god for a way to the top floor
Draft measurements, map out the honor
I'm far too tired to be a martyr
Contact

[Verse 2: Sunspot Jonz]
Sun like the night never comes
Like the one on the drum and a bottle full of rum
Pum-pum in the trunks and a swisher full of skunk
Bump, bump too drunk to ever stay in a funk
Living in a wishing well, steps from hell
Dreaming I'm a mermaid, in lava scales
In a bed of bullet shells
And promises that fell
Trailing these dreams like these beats don't sting
Clubber Lang on opponents, king of shadow boxing
Come come bitch till it's all done
Time traveling, kisses, what are you not among?
Galaxy in orbits, that they never see
Lets journey right now, solar system of beats
Where I live with the shadows, see the candles of the lost
That's why I do this, never forgotten on the cross
Now what you gonna do?
Now what you gonna say?
We live through the hate and [?] cause we knowing our way
I'm only seeing you
The things the same
The things the same
Make me do the things [?]

[Sample]
If I could be close it all and all
If I could be close to it all

[Outro: Slug]
Tried to pluck your feather just to see to see you spread your wings
Fly bitch, fly
Bitch!
I don't think I've said bitch on a song for like, eight or nine years
(Laughter)
