[Verse 1: Slug]
And I don't even know why
I can't hold on to a word that you say
You escaped from your cage just to dance in play
I cross a random face like fly away, little horse, fly
45 you're on the front page
We're familiar with the frustration
To save the day we stay sedated it's understatement
Look alive like this is a celebration
We would like to use your current location
Lost faith after the first rotation
I gave it back to the dirt
Like it wasn't worth saving
Oh, Lord, if I wasn't so bored
I'd already poured this bottle on the floor
Yeah, right, we ain't spilling the drop
About to get so high that we feel like Gods
And I don't even know why

[Hook: Eric Mayson]
Time may cheat, but I don't know why
Cause what I need, I can't buy
You're trying to sleep, I'm trying to fly
But life goes on, and so do I!
I'm trying to fly

[Verse 2: Slug]
And I don't even know why
I still feel like a rat in a maze
Even though I know nowadays
I should probably find a method
To come my ways
I'm tryna leave the runway
Confident, I need to go
Surround myself with sun rays
Life's too short to keep shoveling flakes
I walk into the water till I'm covered in waves
From the first breath till the next laugh
I'd better have a plan to catch the best task
Never let the lakes break beneath the heavyweight
Gotta spray a little paint
On this designated negative space
And I don't even know why
But I'm committed to leave you with the valid, vivid impression
We could separate the pain from the message
But state of mind still in the state of correction
And I don't even know why

[Hook: Eric Mayson]
Time may cheat, but I don't know why
Cause what I need, I can't buy
You're trying to sleep, I'm trying to fly
But life goes on, and so do I!
