Downward (?) spiral, inevitably, everything falls
Hold on I’ve got some hell caught in my eyeball
There was a time, a time where this path that I was following had seemed to want to swallow me whole
And in my mind, my mind, I was stranded on the corner of 3rd and tomorrow ago

I didn’t care, no care, only dared, I never dared, cause I couldn’t abandon the little me
And so I stared, I stared, upon the land without a fear of becoming what it’ll be
Soon came a day, a day, seven plus one to infinity, shook three eight (?) slumber (?) brought the energy
Something, some spark of life, some beam of something seemed to bring me to some type of new awakening

Taking me from this present rut of unproductive that I’ve been stuck with
For as long as I remembered, only fixed that before I saw the bulk
Right before I had to fall, I fell for you right before I hit December

In the physical I used to be miserable, this misguided stranger, with a pocketful of anger
Borderline suicidal, breaking the branch, never thought I’d ever see the arrival of a second chance
Now every minute I start I spend with you, even a thousand miles apart, you live in my chest
You found a home in my heart, and I welcome the nest

Now I’m alive enough to organize my mess
And I could write all day, until my fingers turn blue
And never find how to say the things I need to
Cause ain’t no one invented the words that’s potent enough
To communicate the way that I feel about you

I left the road to ruin, and found the know-what-I’m-doin’
You’re the woman, I’m the man, ‘til there ain’t no more land
I left the road to ruin, and found the know-what-I’m-doin
You’re my woman, I’m the man until there ain’t no more land
