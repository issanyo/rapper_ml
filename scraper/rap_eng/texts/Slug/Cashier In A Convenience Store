[Intro: Slug arguing with himself]
Get up man, wake up
What time is it man?
Yo, its late
What time is it?
Don’t worry about it, it’s late
Fuck man, this dirty motherfuckers gonna yell at at me again?
Just go, just go
I'm sick of this job man
Don’t forget your keys
I should call in sick, no no, I should call in dead
Dude you need this job
Never have to see this place again
What are you talking about?
Slug can't come in hes dead
Dude you need this job, dude

[Verse One]
Late for work
Wearing a wrinkled shirt
I'd love to set this place on fire
Let the sprinkles work
Then that'd be me getting fired
Instead I'll get stoned, arive late
And pretend that I'm tired
Do you need a book of matches with those?
Would you like a bag?
Thank you, have a nice day, I hope you fuckers gag
I pity the fool that pays twice the price for our shit
They could save cash and take their lazy ass to the super market
There's that chick from last month
Remember the one that couldn't figure out which side to pump her gas from
She's coming in, I've got a grin
Cause tonights the night
Yo toots, my nametag might be crooked
But you're looking alright
We all pulling a hard days labor
Gas, milk, soda, bread, porno mags, and newspapers
Back here got the condoms
Over the counter drugs
Listerine for the drunks, Robotusin for the gutter punks
And everyday I look into that mirror
I'm trying to see myself a little bit clearer
I never notice any progress although
I'll be here again to look tomorrow

[Hook]
I'm just a cashier in a convience store
Selling cigarettes and beer between cleaning floors
I've seen it all without leaving this counter place
People, freaks, demons and creatures from outer space
And everyday I show up and sell you your soul
We both inch a little closer to where we're trying to go
You only land for a moment then resume the race
People, freaks, demons and creatures from outer space

[Verse Two]
And I've got your pass to paradise
You can escape all these other parasites
With just one buck, a little luck, you might, yeah right
I suggest you go home and check your fahrenheit
You ain't gonna get rich
You're stuck here just like me
The only difference is your drug is the lottery
The lotto got your mind sometimes your last dime
Use your fingernails to scratch off 3 of a kind
And I've got your pass to paradise
And I'd love to ask you babe, "Where's your life?"
Wonder how you can be so high and still be scared of heights
But I stop cause the customers always right (ya right)
Must take a lunch break before I snap on the next cat
That doesnt know what they need
Gimme a cigarette, a poison apple, I don't care
I'd be happy to just go outside and choke on the seeds

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Seems like everything happens on the retail night shift
Been robbed, had fights, caught fools trying to shop lift
One time some kid got shot in the parking lot
And the cops only come to surround the coffee pot
After bars close, freaks come out the wood work
All drunk and dumb, trying to play their games
Take's patience to deal with iniebriated jerks
But I smile cause theyre the easiest ones to short change
The runners trade me dime bags for squares
The crack heads offer blow jobs for beers
I watch the clock in my head tick tock so slow
And wait for the time to get the fuck out of here
White collar, blue collar, don;t care, gimmie a dollar
Either way its all the same for only seven something an hour
Your all a bunch of monsters, you live in hell
Just waitin' for these products to go on sale
The best customers are the ones that's just passing through
Asking for directions, gassing up with fuel
I swear to god some day I'm gonna live that way
With no one to answer to and no more dues to pay

I hate you but I love you
Don't know what I think of you
I can't seem to shake you from my life
Just pay me and save me
Before you drive me crazy
Don't know if I can take another night
