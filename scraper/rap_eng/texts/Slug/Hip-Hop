VERSE TWO [Magnetic]
I'm buzzing over ya head like a smoke alarm, Greet you like I'm cleaning my guns...with open arms, Holding on to the past don't change the present, Maybe the future tense of your presence, come and find out - even gangsters can't live off respect, call it a tumor, got to get this shit off my chest, surgical movement, an emcee that's certain to do it, speak the truth and ALL facts pertinent to it, last time I collabed with a Slug, people bugged
People dug but out here fear equals love, And they love my click - talk shit when we leave, I come thru solo they even scared to breathe, The closest one to me is under me or underneath - another's feet, Make me put a tear up on ya mother's cheek, even cops know it's better not to fuck with us, not hustlers we bust at ya and cut throat ya customers !!!
