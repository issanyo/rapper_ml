[Hook: Grynch] {x2}
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling great, just the way I should
And I ain't with the drama, no used in getting bothered
Cause itâ€™s a beautiful day, call me Mr. Rogers

[Verse One: Bambu]
Now I ain't never been to Ballard
I admit it man I'm kinda scared
Especially if I get stuck out there without Grynch there
Mr. Rogers with Mr. Buck Rogers in my neighborhood
Our hats is all Los Angeles Dodgers
In the park with paper baggies throwing footballs in the air
Welcome to my neighborhood, now fix your fucking stare
Ha ha ha
I'm playing, we just mad cause our rent due
And we just don't have time to care if we offend you
So I am built from rap and underneath my snap back hat
I pack enough of that effin wizard shit I make Floyd collapse
Face first
[?]
A Pac Man down next to bottle of Hen'
Mean
I hang with vicious rap athletes
I hung out with Slug in a Minnesota Applebees
(Ruby Tuesday's man)
I mean a Ruby Tuesday's actually
Sorry, still hung over from hanging with John Overlie
It's...

[Verse Two: Slug]
Minneapolis
Southside civilian
No matter where I'm at, I'm outside the building
I stood with the tallest trees
Still wear my neighborhood on my sleeve
Nomadic
Move with the wind but
Leave a new friend anywhere you attend
Show gratitude
Show stolen
Show the whole Earth what my block is worth
Ha ha
The fortunate soldier
Because a lot of the corner never got to get older
So I spent winter in the cold basement of a warm home
Hibernating in the headphones
With a head full
Try to grow while the media surroundings ebb and flow
It never plateau's on the verge of stressful
The world is a ghetto but the songs are special
It goes...

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Grynch]
I just finished my Caribbean roast
Down at Paseo, the grub is what I'm feeling the most
But what I propose
Now is for the cheers and the toast
I'm trying to find a spot where I can go and chill with my folks
And yeah I suppose, this loop is right where I'm gonna meet him
For a super size, 33 ounces to freedom
6'2" short of sublime
Still I see the sunshine
Focused on the fun times
Like I said, "I'm fine."
Yeah, you're tripping homie, don't blame me
It's a good day like it'd be when we beat O.K.C
Huh
My days living here, I wouldn't take none back
The 206 is just righteous like to shake one flat
Seattle Washington the place I was born
The place I've grown
Nah, there ain't no place like home
There ain't no place like home
When I'm here yeah I feel alright
Still ain't worried 'bout a damn thing I'll tell you why
