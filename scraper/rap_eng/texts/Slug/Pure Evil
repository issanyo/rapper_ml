[Chorus: I.B.E.]
No, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
I don't believe you
I don't believe you
No, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
This is pure evil, this is pure evil

[Verse: Slug]
When I woke up this morning my
Only intention was to look in my reflection
With mutual respect, yeah
I know I'm more than just a badge and a weapon
But, when you see me comin'
You recognize my profession
You should believe that Ima leave an impression
Even if it means I gotta put my knee on your neck, man
Was never meant for you to pass this test
The last question on the quiz is
What the fuck'd you expect man?
A little money made him want some protection
Because a Manny with no money made the
Money feel threatened
And we accept there's gonna be some exceptions
But it's built on a connection of ownership and possessions
Baby boy you pay attention to them lessons
If you flexin' any teeth, Ima send you to the dentist
It all depends on how you fit into my spectrum
From lectures, to handcuffs, to beat downs, to death wish
I was told to tell a one sided story, and that's why I had to eliminate your perspective
I was afraid for my death
I had to make an assessment
Ain't my day to be checked
I felt the weight on my chest
I was told to tell a one sided story
So, say a prayer cause this one's gone to Heaven
Innocence is a submissive position
It's a one-sided story
Read it to your children

[Chorus: I.B.E.]
No, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
I don't believe you
I don't believe you
No, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
This is pure evil, this is pure evil

No, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
