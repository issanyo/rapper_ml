The Grouch:
Bass in the track and the trunk roll slap
Seats leaned back
Man the beat's so fat it goes boom
Baby kinda fly with them big big thighs
All you tryin to do is get her back to the room
And go boom
Make it slump, make it bounce
Make it pound, pound it out
If you really go hard you know
Just really how hard you go

Slug:
As a youth, I used to roll a station wagon
With bad suspension, the tail was draggin
It didn't have a system either
So I filled the back with a bunch of house speakers
Felt like a champion
The windows rattlin
Rusted paint, wood panel and
It didn't matter I was still the man to them
I always had the dopest tapes
Crunchy highs, distorted bass
Hit the schools, with my fools
Ante up to get a pack of Kools
Kept the jams in a paper bag
MC Sham, and Ultra Mag
It's Critical Beat Down
Girl put your seat down
About to turn up the heat now
You can ride shotgun till the cops come
Jump trunk jack ain't a problem
Hit the spot and make the ballers laugh
But now they all ask for my autograph
And now I gotta better whip
But my system's still on some retro shit
Still stuck in the days of old
To turn up the bass in that stock stereo it goes...

(Hook)

Eligh:
Boom, everlasting bass
Crack your window wipers need some masking tape
Never been one to run the beat it gives me juice
When I'm rolling down the block
You know it get me loose it goes boom
And it's shakin down my spine
I'm breakin down my penmanship
My love and frequency's divine so make room
When I grab the microphone I'm havin fun so get my point
If you goin hate then get the fuck out of my room
Cause my tune goes slap
Amp Live create make the boom go bap
Simplify speech keep it blue and black
So you and I can travel to the moon and back
Cause he and E been doin this here for many a year
No way to tally up all the fear and all the tears
No way to rally growth without lookin in the mirror
Don't need a beer I got my fade right here it goes boom
And I like the way it feels
Get em out their panties without takin off the heels
Then get her off her man it might could take a little skill
But I'm not the one to chase a bitch to guard my grill
I'd rather chill, cause I'm a grown ass man
Might look 21 but I'm a grown ass man
Used to live in a hole that's where I made my first grand
And ever since then, I keep my slump up in my trunk it goes..

(Hook)

Eligh:
Tell me what it takes to jump and dont land
Bakin my cakes with bass no coke and
Hit you high like my fly bass from France
From another planet can you understand?

The Grouch:
Blow the speakers
Blow her back out
Just playin, ain't sayin I'm goin act out
Not a grouch really, I'm a gentleman
I'm a homebody, I'm a simpleton
I'm a pimp my pen until the earth burns
Got hooks and lines, but I'm not an earthworm
Kill the stereo types in the stereo
I'm a hero to tikes
I'm your nephew's idol my rap's his Bible
Act like a black light acknowledge my glow
We keep the bass low, like Geico
And watch the place go dumb but I don't
I can feel my face I'm conscious
I go hard though the grind is monstrous
Big bars, how far not on shit
Sell it to the kids they want this
