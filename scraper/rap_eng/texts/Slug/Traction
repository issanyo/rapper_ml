[Intro]
You're steppin' to us? You need traction
Or you'll be another sucker missin' in action

[Verse 1: Pat Juba]
Pathological fantasies of a million OZ's
Inhalational OD ecstasy codeine slow beam vision
Of life in and out of prison impressionable wisdom
Struggle your zone son, vivid

[Verse 2: Sept Sev Sev Two]
Man, fuck a rapper, fuck his crew and fuck the label that owns him
I take it there, state of affairs has got me jonesin'
The real hit to get me lit and immobile
Promos cross the global but most are lackin' in vocals
They don't suffice, that's why we must heist
There ain't no substance in your cup
There's just a whole bunch of crushed ice
How bout I just buy two nice box sets
Before I buy a copy of that obnoxious shit
Or even pay to see you rock your shit
I lost my grip on the hope I carry
But you lost reality when I grabbed the mic and broke your cherry
Mission, ignore the bullshit out of existence
Alas, overruled, cause they got the masses twisted

[Verse 3: Mr Gene Poole]
I wonder if God'll have any pity on MC's
Or if he'll just judge them as being average human beings
Some ain't seein' their faults, Others become part of a rapper
Caught in a way to be placed in the back of a vault
The black angel can't be caught stalkin'
Sometimes you can feel him when you're walkin'
Listenin' when you're talkin'
Thine eyes is keener than a falcon
Excuse me for gawkin' I think I seen your face before in a coffin
Or maybe I robbed you out while we were golfin'
Like ?, jet back off to the loft where
We count the software, Life is always false never fair
So there's, no type of amusement to take music out of my hair

[Verse 4: General Woundwart]
I grew up psychotic but I kept the shit in the closet
Readin' magazines about scopin' and killin' targets
That's why I'm harshed with, any individual
Who wants to test the lyrical meta-gal
I ring bells and swing rails over the crowd
Tryin' to scowl to the mic, Who can envision my living?
Havin' sessions throughout the night, Why get excited
When I see these fake MC's stylin', cancelled contracts are pilin'
Niggas be jivin'. Tellin' lies and fibs about the life you live
You must be high off this drama in the triflin' bids
I strike your shit and bring about violent current tears
Cause I'm merciless, suck on a nipple just for preservatives

[Verse 5: Pat Juba]
Accurate attack, smack niggas back millenniums
Militant tactics attract black youth to my Tienanmen square
Cinnamon brown-skin four point square
Assault mechaniz, I stagger with air, through the record biz
Oblivious to foul shit, hell & corporate
Dig Dug helium mentality, nigga forfeit
Jewels, royalty, car keys, Gs, garment
Deadly dormant, ass naked out your apartment
Complex, niggas are starving
Principality normally, fatality verbally burn, scalding
Ancient art forms pour out my cauldron
Adrenaline runs free, I’m pole vaulting
Faulty individuals seek for higher medicine
Mescaline, masculinity converts feminine
Melanin, I gots that locked like DNA code
Too much ying, without your yang sucker, your bound to fold

[Verse 6: Mr Gene Poole]
I been havin' a chat with my alter ego, and we know
Suckas will be fakin' everywhere we go
He's a honky and I'm a negro but we're equal
Lookin' at life, stayin' away from what might be lethal
Let's do what's illegal, I'm sick of this game, it's evil
And niggas is insane like cutlasses and regales
I see no more originality in flows
That's why I've grown colder than the Minnesota snows
And who knows when a life comes and when one goes
I just have to stay on my toes long after I've gone pro
I don't want the barrio, I need construction concrete
To build my shit and I don't give a fuck how much you stomp beef

[Verse 7: General Woundwart]
People try to be extravagant with they inhabitants
Yapping about their yearly income and what they’re averaging
That shit is gaverin' and all the hoes dancin' in the club
Lookin' for love, showin' leg to get a scrub
Niggas have got you gassed off the limos and cash
But that shit is a fantasy cause I tell you will never last
I got a little heart so I'mma tell you a psalm
But don't ever make the mistake thinkin' that I give a fuck

[Verse 8: Sep Sev Sev Two]
Inflicted, I clench my eyes and let the tenseness rise
Clench the mic by the neck, take a breath and then surprise
Whoda known? We won't leave you alone
We grab you by your collar bone, we drag you screamin' through the zone
The truth is shown, that showings after a short break
Enough time to violate an MC if we skip the foreplay
Now I'mma catch a breath, if you wanna test your rep
The line begins over here on the left, Dynospec
