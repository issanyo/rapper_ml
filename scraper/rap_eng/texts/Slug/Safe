[Verse One] [Pigeon John]:
I was in your little belly
You were in Kansas in a hotelly
You were worried cause you were late and he didn’t know
You paced back and forth looking out the window
Make sure he’s not around when you make the phone call
Your hands shaky you don’t know if it’s the wrong call
Already got one angel sleeping quiet on the bed
Innocent child, curly hair on his little head
And you were once one, didn’t know you still were in all
A daughter of a king sitting in a dark ball
Your silhouette shines thin through the curtain
The phone’s to your ear, nothing’s for certain
You got the number, got the plan, hear the dial tone
It sounds loud and it rings through your thin bones
7 digits and the whole deal’s fixed quick
But you’re froze cold, and you feel sick
You looked at your angel again
You slowly put the phone back on its hinge
You lie down right next to my big brother
You try not to cry when you got under covers
You had no money, had no plan, barely had a call
But it was funny you didn’t worry about it all
You fell asleep in your bed with your new son
I felt your hand on my head
It was all done

[Chorus] [Jo Wilkinson]:
I love you, yes I love you
I love you, yes I love you
I love you, yes I love you
I love you, yes I love you

[Verse Two] [Slug]:
Momma, momma, your boy tipped over
But this cross ain’t your burden to shoulder
It’s not your fault that the joker
Can’t find his own way home when he’s sober
Most minutes, strictly business
Wanna do great, wanna make a difference
But when the liquor hits, shifted
Gonna put this any where that it fits
No respect for love and safety
Gave face as a place to hate me
You made me and named me, but have you seen me lately?
I’m not the same baby
Nah
I take the whole blame, I made the choice to try to play this old game
Soul got wet from cold rain
When I meet the devil, I’mma say my full name
Free fell, ain’t a thing to tell
You know this world, and you’ve seen its hell
Chin up, kinda like yourself
Too much pride inside this ain’t a cry for help
I wanna be comfortably numb
And I’m in the cycle with the life I run from
Can’t speak on the crimes I’ve done
I’m afraid that you won’t recognize your son

[Chorus] [Jo Wilkinson]:
I love you, yes I love you
I love you, yes I love you
I love you, yes I love you
I love you, yes I love you

[Verse Three] [Eligh]:
Even if I lost my life a million miles from home
My heart would hold you like a locket encrusted in diamonds and chrome
That’s the way I keep from depression under pressure
With bullets whizzing past my ears in this battle zone I’m alone
I love you like the wind, and yes we’ve just begun
The wind because it blows me close to you when I’m on the run
I’m moving through this desert, the sun is chapping my back
Iraq is no joke, I lack, no hope
I’m playing my part, you’re safe in my heart
So keep me on your mind, I’ll keep you in my thoughts
I’m moving through this desert, the sun is chapping my back
Iraq is no joke, I lack, no hope
I’m playing my part, you’re safe in my heart
So keep me on your mind, I’ll keep you in my thoughts
I’m moving through this desert, the sun is chapping my back
So keep me in your mind, I'll keep you in my thoughts

[Jo Wilkinson]:
Pipelines pumping oil or smack
You get rich off my kid’s back
You take my son and make him pay
Keep him harnessed either way

[Chorus] [Jo Wilkinson]:
I love you, yes I love you
I love you, yes I love you

Drugs, booze, your dirty war
He’s not sure what life is for
With your greed you keep him bound
He’s so lost he can’t be found

[Chorus] [Jo Wilkinson]:
I love you, yes I love you
I love you, yes I love you

A mother knows her child’s true worth
From the very moment she gives birth
The only choice I ever made
To give you life, now how you’ve paid

[Chorus] [Jo Wilkinson]:
I love you, yes I love you
I love you, yes I love you

A mother’s love runs deeper still
Than all the oil in all the drills
They may take your body, not your soul
You’re safe in my heart
I won’t let go...

[Chorus] [Jo Wilkinson]:
I love you, yes I love you
I love you, yes I love you

Safe, safe in my heart
We’re never apart...I love you, yes I love you...
