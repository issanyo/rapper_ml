[Intro]
All my life's been a technicolor feature
That I've had to watch in tears from the 13th row

[Hook]
From the... BLOCK! To the city, to the streets
BLOCK! And all those out of reach
From the... BLOCK! From the bottom to the top
We built it block by BLOCK! We built it block by BLOCK!

[Verse 1: Classified]
Yeah, they say by 25 the best in life has come and gone
I think I'm livin' proof they couldn't be more fuckin' wrong
I've seen it vividly, turn misery to victory
My injuries are history, I kept pushin' and truckin' on
The game is war and I just bought myself some huntin' gear
I'm fully loaded like I'm partyin', shotgunnin' beers
I run the streets and I don't mean I run the streets
I just mean I started joggin' and the dog is off the leash
I've been writin' and re-writin', recordin' and re-recordin'
I've been cuttin' and pastin', second guessin' what I've been makin'
I've been lost in translation, tryna get back to the basics
I never grew up so don't expect me to act what my age is
I never changed... my beard game is lame
Went from peachfuzz to grey hair in the same day
Keep your chin up, and keep the marijuana grade A
Livin' on the same BLOCK! Still runnin' the same race
And the show goes on

[Pre-Hook]
And they never changed the story
And they never changed the story
And they never changed the story
And they never stopped us here

[Hook]
From the... BLOCK! To the city, to the streets
BLOCK! And all those out of reach
From the... BLOCK! From the bottom to the top
We built it block by BLOCK! We built it block by BLOCK!

[Verse 2: Snack the Ripper]
Yeah, it all happens for a reason, random or not
Constantly remind myself not to abandon my thought
Nah I just keep on movin' like the hand on the clock
They wanna see me quit now, but I ain't plannin' to stop
Don't know exactly what I'm doin', but this shit feels right
It's like the world don't exist when I sit here and write
Bein' broke is a distraction, I'm just blockin' it out
If it ain't about profit, what the fuck we talkin' about?
Don't get me wrong, ain't in it for the vanity
Tryna put some money in the hands of my family
Every mistake, every lesson life's handin' me
Made me who I am, this shit didn't happen randomly
So I'ma keep on goin' and there ain't nobody stoppin' this
Communication's critical, no matter what the topic is
It's obvious.. blunt smokin' and I'm burnin' 'em slow
My goal: keep murderin' shows 'til the curtains are closed, the goals

[Pre-Hook]
And they never changed the story
And they never changed the story
And they never changed the story
And they never stopped us, yeah
Never changed the story
And they never changed the story
And they never changed the story
And they never stopped us, yeah

[Hook]
From the... BLOCK! To the city, to the streets
BLOCK! And all those out of reach
From the... BLOCK! From the bottom to the top
We built it block by BLOCK! We built it block by BLOCK!

[Verse 3: Slug from Atmosphere]
I promise to God that I've been tryna finish all my thoughts
But it's a big dog eat smaller dog
And if the confidence drops when the compliments stop
Then we prolly ought to look for alternate jobs
Now, lick a shot for those watchin' the clock
Or pick a lock if that's the popular stock
This the opposite of Photoshop
I was taught, before I step in your house, take my moccassins off
Now, no option but to go solid
This sheriff brought with him a posse of cops
And they got some shotguns, solvin' problems
Bottle poppin', molotov
The world keep spinnin' until everybody fallin' off
When it finally stops, I'll be down in Mardi Gras
And talkin' 'bout it all right now has got me so damn shot
I need to take another walk around my BLOCK!

[Pre-Hook]
And they never changed the story
And they never changed the story
And they never changed the story
And they never stopped us, yeah
Never changed the story
And they never changed the story
And they never changed the story
And they never stopped us, yeah
