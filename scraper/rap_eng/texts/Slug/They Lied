They Lied...

It ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

[Spawn]

Eh yo Slug, I used to know this girl named Dawn
Back in the day she had love and everybody was fond
See Dawn was the bomb, her attitude it was calm
Her heart was warm though with the wrong peeps she tagged along
Now she’s gone, long passed away
She kicked it with this kid named Andre who lived life the wrong way

[Slug]

I know that kid, seemed as if he had no insecurities
Acted like he was the mac mixed with Hercules
Disturbingly flow just to hold the title “Fly cool”
The first one to tow the tool freshman year in high school
Now mind you, this was back a decade
We was thinking girls, music, shoes, Andre was thinking get paid
But let’s say my man just had a knack for acting ill
To the level of immaculate as if it was a practiced skill
He’d have to fill your head with tales
Keep a rep from getting stale
Fourteen, said he spent his winter break in jail
As time goes by, the lines that try to differentiate
The fake from truth get loose so what’s the use?
Kid was living on the rails cause he chooses to
Goes to jail, comes back with juice, crews enthused
Who knew the bruise would heal so quick?
Who knew the passion would become fashion
And get you fastened onto his dick?
You might as well have let him penetrate
The situation shook me, looking at rookies that try to emulate
One sets the standard, the weak randomly follow
Space ain’t shit, some kid’ll take your place tomorrow
The cycle never stops cause you can’t recycle styrofoam
I still see Andre nowadays, he fucks with microphones

[Spawn]

Man, they lied, it ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

[Slug]

They lied, it ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid
What you got ain’t nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

[Spawn]

They lied, it ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

[Slug]

But the sun will come out tomorrow
And you can bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow
There’ll be someone that’s harder than me and smarter than me
And stronger than me and lasts longer than me
So check my fate, wide awake but feels like I’m sleeping
Trife life can’t catch a wife that’s really worth my keeping
It’s deeper, I peep it, I seem to need to understand
How am I gonna explain to my seed I was the man?

[Spawn]

Wirth Park killings, suicide in crystal court buildings
Young villains holding guns without feelings
Dealing crumbs of demons to those fiending
Lost in dreams when the pressure hit
I mean the fan hit the shit but when the shit hit the fan that was it
Flipped out, you tripped out, you couldn’t handle it
Addicted to life dismantlement
? from distortion to brain abortion forcing to perish
Life’s to cherish, the moments too little
The path is brittle for those who chose to walk hard
In regards to those who front, stunts get elderly
Propelling me to disappointment, could’ve been avoided
By egos posing lethal with weapons
Deceptions are ill, revolve around intentions to kill
Gots to chill on that level or end up with the Devil
Digging your grave somewhere in the middle

[Slug]

It’s no riddle, they lied
It ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

[Spawn]

They lie, it ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

[Slug]

What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it
