Chorus x2
Stay in my route
Hugging the ground
Run from the hound
Never rebound
Turning me out
Letting me drown
Mary goes round
Mary goes round
Top of the mound
Not looking down
Waiting for now
Breaking the clown
Making it loud
Hating the sound
Mary goes round
Mary goes round

[Verse 1: Muad'dib,Slug]
Wanna wear a smile that fits
Gonna balance keep the grip
Gotta go the whole distance
Mary goes round
And when the sun decides to return
Maybe she will lose the fever
Stop and rest because the feet hurt
Where she at now
Climb up on that angry horse
Let the circle take its course
Decisions become a chore
When bury the truth
Manifest inventible
Plant the stress deep into the soul
How much will you forget to know
Carry the tune
And now the villagers scream and moan
About the dreams they didn't have
The ones that move more then they own
Some take the plunge into the child hood ride
Excited to play apart of the truth by feeding the lie
You can change the shape
By rearranging the negative space
Tryna read the look of need thats on their face
But Mary knows now, knows of the yes
You're only as blessed as what goes up your nose
Nice dress

[Hook x2:Muad'dib, Slug, Felix]
Stay in my route
Hugging the ground
Run from the hound
Never rebound
Turning me out
Letting me drown
Mary goes round
Mary goes round
Top of the mound
Not looking down
Waiting for now
Breaking the cloud
Making it loud
Hating the sound
Mary goes round
Mary goes round

[Verse 2: Muad'dib, Slug]
I think I think too much
And all the effort meant something
I've had this dream before
I stand still although I'm running
And they do tease they
Sharpen their fangs before they clown
I used to feel like I was coming up
Until she pushed me down
She thinks I think too much
The love I'm getting is incredible
The more of me that I reveal
The more she plays a vegetable
But its alright okay its just the night right
I give her my all
The more the nails dig in
The more I push the more I stall
I thinks she thinks too much
And now I got that 9 inch feeling
I can feel the pain just filling
From the floor up to the ceiling
And there are plenty of fish for reeling
But I cannot catch one
The more simple it seems
The more its just a big production
I think I think too much
I pay the rumors no attention
Bounce em right up off of my temples
And relieve all of my tension
Push a crunch breakfast lunch
Follow hunch I'll make it
Finding out my own salvation
Hiding in my basement

[Verse 3: Slug]
Lets play with the placement
Lets shake it up for fun
Take it to the break of exhaustion
Then we can wake it up and run
Bonus motives
Indivine intentions
Goodnight inspired
By the silence of the lamp turn off the light
What she knows bout life
She learned from listening to others pain
From the gossip to the grains
Of the sand that form the common mans complain
Can't stand the rain
Difficult to follow the shadow
Of bad weather takes
Too much time and effort to swallow the capsule
And you will have a tough time
To jude and try the love crimes of
I can't see what you can see
I can't see what you can see
But you can take the frustrate
And relate to the love hate
Of I can't see what you can see
I can't see what you can see
Struggle to create the feel
The puzzle made you break the seal
Now I can't see what you can see
I can't see what you can see
Choose to dive into the deep
Tryna kill it in its sleep
Squeeze it till it doesn't make a sound
Mary goes round

[Verse 3: Felix]
Some people like
Loss of control
Loss of confidence
Loss of soul
In-complement
Apathy is so prominent
Common sense I realize is too bland for the spice rack
Like the life experience to swing or fight back
But I like that
I'mma take all my life back with a new take and clean slate
Things become a lot more clear when you slam on the breaks
Give me life and give me attention
Before I love my sanity
The mirror gets so mad at me
And I'm not all about vanity
I've got two hands that rambling
Thats got me scrambling
And all this business handling
That I'm barely managing
See I think I think too much
She has a merry time at my expense
Burying my inner sense and building up the fence
Inventing stories fantasies and
Daydreams and daymares
Lamenting rumors fantasies and blind turns
I stay here

Mary, Mary why you bugging?
Mary, Mary why you bugging?
Mary, Mary why you bugging? Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went that lamb was sure to go
