[Dose One]
You, don't know what happens when, (I) close the door
And furniture comes warm, out to greet me, look
Showing with pride, daze, dust
And imaginary hug on non-conscious brush
Things are better now
I adore these walls as they reveal supple roots
And vibrant flooring, he's home
Seems to penetrate very fabric of the roof above me
As panels seal (ceiling) seal (ceiling) peels
Back the sky so beautiful with knife
Famous purple clouds and mid-light
Ash black sweeps the character away
A truly awesome sight
Outside, makes room and weep for it
The amazing thing is with secrets unfolding
Abound on ground I can only see the light
And thus the moon burns and it tolerates magicals got some inspring
To be or not, join the miraculous now transpiring
That is the, who's flame is it for me to not feed
So my relief becomes my gallion and my poon becomes my bloom
This place has always been an ocean, always been a song

I got a liter of Knob Creek & bottle of Ether
Got the second Mobb Deep creeping out of the speakers
Would prefer to sit home and drink cause it's cheaper
Why you trying to hide the eggs girl, you think that it's Easter?
Got time to kill, got kills to time
Prescription filled, I got pills to climb
Got the firearm ready to rob convenience stores
Got charm baby gonna recruit a team of whores
Got hopes and dreams of no in betweens

(Sole chanting)

I've got hopes and dreams of no in betweens
Good swing keep losing the fall in the green
Good thing most my friends live inside my head
Cause now I'm never alone, when I lie in bed
Got truth can't recall where I put it
Maybe someone took it, mistook it for value and thought they wanted it
Gone with the wind and the rain all that remains is a subtle taste of sin
Laced with grins and astonishment
Don't believe in monsters...I know 'em
Because they dwell in my heart and raise hell in my emotions
If there ever was a reason to live it'd be to die
Now hold still let me wipe the fear out of your eye

Darkness envelopes me, directly after eclipse
It couldn't a mind know, of my lower instincts begin to kick
At nothing, origin represents under my sleeping quarters
Not a noise is being made, but yet I sense that there's no order
Directly beneath my being I'm seeing, nothing but I can squint
But there's commotion taking place I should check, but I don't give
Worked up the courage, after much debating
I proceeded to slowly creep in a reverse vertical
Because I felt I needed, to make the confirmation
Pulled out my coffin, saw a nation of creatures
In different forms I couldn't fight this sensation
They had their re-appearances in their own separate ways
But all had the same familiar faces I've been staring at for days

That goes the cause here to hear him scratching
Calling me names, calling me out my name
Attractive not wallpaper, my wallpaper is turned to a piss yellow tint
The post is a prank, all the faces are gone
The bodies are dancing, taunting me in spirit
The sounds are everything, but I can hear sarcasm in the lyrics
All the pics in my frames been replaced mirror, glass and slate
Some of 'em are see-through reflect on the ceiling but can't relate
And after all this time, my roses that I've stepped on
My chattered toys are now weapons of mass destruction
Talked and feel the oxygen of opposite in the combines of a quilt comforter
It's safe and pretty
Thunder cockroaches are jabbing me with toothpicks
I tried to scream but I'm left, lipless, voiceless and toothless
Virtually useless and it's messed with my head
Thousand chatter tensions bench around the singing fire
For the stupidest things I've ever said
Gnawing at my flesh, collecting underneath my bed
Intercepting to form a hawking mess
A mammoth in a sense, jacking like an attitude
Weaving me in a web, leaving me for dead
Believe in me, could bet the joy of life
To where I belong, to where I belong
And exist like this forever, why do they never turn the light on?
And why do they always leave the night on?
