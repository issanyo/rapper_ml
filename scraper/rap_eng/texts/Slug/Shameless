I'm trying to live in harmony with everything surrounding me
So all the comedy, you talking doesn't bother me
It used to be your hobby, now it's in economy
But you're still a crab in the barrel of commodities
And I'm the rock lobster, balls of confidence
You probably find me at the bar drinking compliments
Billy Crystal marvelous until it's obvious
Your momma gets it on the other side of the metropolis
King park mojo, like a mofo
Close down the whole show, I'm an old pro
The crow flies over those that blow snow
Worldwide I grow and grow
And I spit my two cents, you give me your two cents?
Then I split it amongst a few friends
We come from the land of the wavey lines
We won't wait to climb, we don't waste our time, nah
Put a star in the map, my city shines
We carry weight that'll snap the piggies spine
I know you want to hold and claim this
I wrap my wings around you and show you're shameless

[Hook: Slug] Show no shame

[MaLLy]
So focused, appropriate on the j-o
Pay rolls to a-holes, stress tryna lay low
Never false put my sack where ya tongue lies
Rest one eye, it shines up like a sunrise
Time is so critical, I'm taking flight
You ain't nice just for rhyming up lyrical miracle
The top looks good I feel heavy there, every year
You can't walk in my shoes, know I bought a better pair
Promo pretty, the whole cold with me
Celebrating sippin' slow, mo wet the Liffey
The best brothers, I hope the rest lovers
Be a Stevey so key, to you internet cutlass
They act so foul, I got to blow the damn whistle
Even take shots with no bullet in the pistol
So gets you, they bleed up against you
I ordered my plate bitch! Get your own menu
Put a star in the map, my city shines
We carry weight that'll snap the piggies spine
I know you want to hold and claim this
I wrap my wings around you and show you're shameless

Flow shameless low maintenance
Playing with this energy is dangerous on these stages
From basements to Vegas leave craters in the pavement
And we still hungry these waiters in amazement
Party like we leaving and it's no gardens but we eating
Moms sorry she ain't started from achievement
But I brought my dreams in our girls live off Jameson and Wheat Thins
They get around town like my beat disc
Still be on some beast shit get a rapper's mic took
Only drop cold versus like we don't write hooks
Reporting from the bottom on a dark corner we was popping
So you hear us now then you do the knowledge
Seen it from the entry the combined rhyme this is chemistry
You either leave nothing or a legacy mention me
Everybody rap so it's cooler now to be a fan
You would think that this was god's plan
Put a star in the map my city shines
We carry weight that'll snap the piggies spine
I know you want to hold and claim this
I wrap my wings around you and show you're shameless

I both bottom of the barrel, and cream of the crop
The last thing to leave when you cleaning the pot
Surrounding by [inaudible] and my peeps in the box
Fours rapping we giving emcees a reason to stop
No leaver exists that can equal this feverish bitch
Leaders of the league, believe in the kid
My ice [inaudible] can turn a [inaudible]
Remove a dome, and attach it to a statue with a funeral home
If I breathe with Hercules, he would bruise to the bone
My style is like air, too elusive to hold
I feel like an anomaly in a game full of Misters Miss
Everybody sounds the same and they don't seem to give a shit
When it comes to punchlines, bitch I got a [inaudible]
Paycheck emcees are too weak, period
Killing every guest feature as well as appearances
So ahead of my time, remind me what year it is
Put a star in the map, my city shines
We carry weight that'll snap the piggies spine
I know you want to hold and claim this
I wrap my wings around you and show you're shameless
