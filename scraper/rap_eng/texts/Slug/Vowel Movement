[Intro 1]
Yo, yo, before I set shit off
Let me tell you my name is Slug from a crew called Atmosphere, Headshots
And I don't give a fuck, I'll battle anybody
I don't give a fuck, I'll battle anybody
So wait let me do it right
Tell me how much weight you carry
Tell me how much waight you carry

[Intro 2]
Rhymesayers..
Rhymesayers always regular
Rhymesayers always regular with vowel movement

[Verse 1]
I talk circles around the brain matter of folds
It's just a reminder of who came fatter with flows
An rhymes to snatch the essaince outcha skin without damaging you pupils
Cause you'll need all your vision to see this lyricism
With rediculous precision I rid this division of emcees
Take head, fake snead, to relieve they positions
Get lost i toss kids a snack when they flow is wack
Your crew is on my dick, I'm lettin' you hold my sack
I'm suposin' thats the reason for your treason
Ear's bleedin is what the atmosphere leavin' kid
I season shit, oh jesus it's the Slug influence
Fuck your crew bitch ya ego is a nuisance
I loosen up the screws on your goose neck
Now ya handle bars is stripped
If you was smart you'd quit
Cause true heads get lothogic with ur shit
My man you do not know the boundaries
Your circumference got sketchy in the center when you found me
From around these parts regardless of where these parts is
I start shit cause that's where my heart is
I've been dubbed the design never intended for the weak mind
I transit pass that cheap line responsible for ur confidence
Brainwash hence since you grabbed the mic all I can hear is rinse cycles
Clean your lint screen, keep your low balance, keep your low balance
You've got no talent therefore, you are no challenge

[Hook]
So why do you wanna mic if you do not know how to use it ?
Why do you want the mic if you don't know how to use it ?
I'm not here just to talk shit kid, I do shit
Rhymesayers always regular with vowel movement
Why do you want the mic if you don't know how to use it ?
Tell me why do you want the mic if you don't know how to use it ?
I'm not here just to talk shit kid i do shit
Rhymesayers always regular with vowel movement

[Verse 2]
I talk circles around the brain matter of folds
It's just a reminder of who came fatter with flows
An rhymes to snatch the soul outcha skin w/o damagin' your ear drums
So you can hear your fear when Atmosphere comes
Near done Spawn grabbed the silverware an cups
I'll grab the emcee out the oven lets sit down an tear shit up
Cause most of 'em are like pastry's with creamy centers
You get stuck between my dentures when you feel me enter
Feel cemente the point be in your destination equation
Base intentsion's on the fact that we leave facial ebbrasion's
Rhymesayers take your station's
Competitions tryna shed life
The competition may as well of grabbed a dead mic
Get your head right before your head get's left for this dam
Cause I get amped when kids rant
With averageness they just can't match the antics
The Atmos, never placid takes more than practice
So fuck with my fontic acrobatics
Cronic wackness, that the diaognosis I've obstolled
This current phasurence was determinded in a crazy spin
Take the spacey grin an flip it upside
Cause nuff died when sjug applied fist to this mic
Device is priceless think twice if you wanna piece of this
Get you ferverous check your fahrenheit I'm tearing mics
Crews get lost within thoughts of how we do sit
Rhymesayers always regular with vowel movement

[Hook]
So why do you want the mic if you don't know how to use it ?
Why do you want the mic if you don't know how to use it ?
I'm not here just to talk shit, I do shit
Rhymesayers always regular with vowel movement
Why do you want the mic if you don't know how to use it ?
Tell me why do you want the mic if you don't know how to use it ?
I'm not here just to talk shit kid, I do shit
Rhymesayers always regular with vowel movement
