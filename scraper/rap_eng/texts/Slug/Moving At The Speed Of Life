[Hook: Aesop Fables]
Yes ya'll, we're moving at the speed of life
Illuminate the path that we're moving on
Accumulate knowledge in amounts where we make the people bounce with the music in surround

[Hook: Slug]
Yes ya'll, we're moving at the speed of life
Illuminate the path that we're moving on
Accumulate knowledge in amounts where we make the people bounce with the music in surround

[Verse 1: Slug]
That's me, ridin' in the back of a taxi
Gotta go home where I can't sleep
Kill the telephone and be alone to advance but it had to be
Psychos, caught in the middle of a typo
Act like you didn't know life goes
The World Fair, ain't no fair when you're working at the sideshow
Well, you find a little piece of hell
I hope there's a mirror in your cell
To break everyday you wake up to you and take a look at yourself now
Calm down
Just another tear from the sad clown
Take another year put it on the ground
Spread it all around little gas and a match and it's all gonna pass like (woo)

[Verse 2: Aesop Fables]
Make the people move to the moment you get
Move through the movement the moment use it
Listen with your mind, but just don't lose it
Find the time to fuse it
To the life you're choosing

[Hook: Aesop Fables]
Yes ya'll, we're moving at the speed of life
Illuminate the path that we're moving on
Accumulate knowledge in amounts where it makes the music count for the music it surrounds

[Verse 3: Aesop Fables]
We make songs that move you 'til you're dead wrong
Wrong or right, I fight through the morning light
Catch sight of this child of the wild moon
Consumin' wild shrooms, laughing at your cartoons
On a bar stool tryin to stay sane and maintain
This feral blood drinking wolfsbane
Fuck what you say
You're trying to make a fake connection like a toupee

[Verse 3: Slug]
My thoughts come mildly affected
By you and the light you projected
No choice but to clash with a battle
You had me here to cast a shadow
One seed would grow your belief
But if we agreed
No one would bleed
Can't lose the need to struggle
Just another piece of the puzzle
Fuck you
Must do, what I think is best for who
Throw your hands in the air tryin' to catch the truth
Set the preferences on burn
Cause it's your world but your world don't turn
Make it hot, tryin' to make it out
Sittin' in the same spot, same vacant house
Get, get, get proud, get loud
And you still don't know what I'm talkin' about, now

[Hook: Slug]
Yes ya'll, we're moving at the speed of life
Illuminate the path that we're moving on
Accumulate knowledge in amounts where we make the people bounce with the music in surround

[Hook: Aesop Fables]
Yes ya'll, we're moving at the speed of life
Illuminate the path that we're moving on
Accumulate knowledge in amounts where we make the people bounce with the music in surround

[Outro: Slug & Aesop Fables]
You leave, you try
You laugh, you cry
You did, you lie
You live, you die
You will, you won't
You feel, you don't
You heal, and you crack
And I promise still I got your back
You leave, you try
You laugh, you cry
You did, and you lie
You live, and you die
You will, and you won't
You feel, and you don't
You heal, and you crack
I promise still I got your back
You leave, you try
You laugh, and you cry
You did, and you lie
You live, and you die
You will, and you won't
You feel, and you don't
You heal, and you crack
I promise still I got your back
You leave, and you try
And you laugh, and you cry
And you did, and you lie
And you live, and you die
You will, and you won't
You feel, and you don't
You heal, and you crack
I promise still I got your back

(Like that)
