[Intro: Evidence]

[Hook]
Been here for too long, said it's time to ride
Got to push it on, cause I'm
Been here for too long, yes it's time to fly
Got to get along, cause I'm late for the sky
Been here for too long, got to uh
Cause I'm late for the sky

[Verse 1: Slug]
I dream what these wings won't do
Cause counting sheep is easy as 1, 2
Jumping out the nest to catch some bird food
Clutch's so tense that the knuckles turned blue
I been hooped to wise men, check horizon
Read the flight plan, spread the life spam
Sky heights are set, it's time to climb these steps
We only tryna get free from the spider's web
Gotta murder all the messing around
Carry the burden of work, never setting it down
With a spotlight now, my shot, my chance
Put a plot of land in the pockets of my pants
Break loose, raise roof when the kick drops
They flew straight through, no pit stops
Lift off with your head in the clouds
Or get lost in the rest of the crowd

[Hook]
Been here for too long, said it's time to ride
Got to push it on, cause I'm
Been here for too long, yes it's time to fly
Got to get along, cause I'm late for the sky
Been here for too long, got to uh
Cause I'm late for the sky

[Verse 2: Evidence]
Here's a quotable, slash rap notable
Slash Mike gone but Janet still controllin' you
I'm rarely candid, my view panoramic
My eyes wide shut, if not one, a hole-in-two
I'm packing double, getting up too early
I'm actually trouble, kinda acting 7:30
(Out of my mind)
Attracted to this Earth, maybe acting kinda worldly
But running on my work that says Ev I better hurry
I'd rather worry debt than being pushed through the line
Still a perfect record jet, never late when I fly
Moving hectic, testing patience of this time when I rhyme
Not an out to death trying, saying late for the sky
Late for my prime, but something that was shaped by design
I been running while the others burnt from racing the line
Makin' it great coincides with makin' it mine
Coincides with the hate that I'm makin' it signs
Let me start from the beginning, I'm rewinding the clock
Pitch my heart in every inning like I did with the knock
And it don't stop, a body in motion stays in motion
Coach seat between the wings of this Boeing

[Hook]
Been here for too long, said it's time to ride
Got to push it on, cause I'm
Been here for too long, yes it's time to fly
Got to get along, cause I'm late for the sky
Been here for too long, got to uh
Cause I'm late for the sky

[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]
From a chicken wire frame and a house of wax
To a rocket exploding into a cloud of bats
I been it, dog meat in the '76 Plymouth
Sittin' bitch, antenna divining for live witches
Have you buried a corpse, can you suture a wound
Do you get a fuzzy feeling when the beautiful lose
Like a behooving of a crew to snap Buddha, enthuse greatly
Prove a definitive crucible of mood-making
Four wolves find me to speak as an eye-witness
We will be closing in five minutes, find spinach
Not a pleasantry but stirring only enemies of mercy
A plebeian centipede's unearthing something dirty
Same nature later snap on his shoes
Maybe they ratty cause they actually a hat for his roots
That anchor every perfect pivot to the city's nervous system
Til I make the following preferred decision, listen

[Hook]
Been here for too long, said it's time to ride
Got to push it on, cause I'm
Been here for too long, yes it's time to fly
Got to get along, cause I'm late for the sky
Been here for too long, got to uh
Cause I'm late for the sky
