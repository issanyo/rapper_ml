[Hook]

Ain't seen it all but I think I've seen enough
Still basically hated, jaded, acting like a buzzkill
I'm too used to these nights being fun-filled
Baby baby I don't want to be a buzzkill
I don't want to be a buzzkill but the battle's always uphill
I need something new until I quit being such a buzzkill

[Verse 1: Intuition]

Look I was raised in the sticks but I love me some city life
This urban sprawl got me running with some shifty types
Slept through the sun due to fun from the fifty nights
I just spent searching for someone to kiss me right
This overdriver that'll still make the party rock
Sleep with girls that's hardly hot to prove that I'm an artsy snob
I'm everywhere but I'm always showing tardy dawg
Fashionably late's better than early when I'm on my job
My team sticker hit you with the flea flicker
We'll run her past your spot depends on the free liquor
There'd better be some pseudo-celebs or scene sisters
If we don't see Lindsay or Hayden, you bet we'll leave quicker
People ask me why I look so bored
It's cause I'm by my idols so much I ain't shook no more
I blow some smoke from my lungs looking broke as a bum
Backstage at the venue having no fucking fun
Done too many drugs, seen too many people
Get too many shuns after too many evils
And today has just begun, it's got too many sequels
So I made this little number, here's what two pennies equals

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slug]

I gotta get far away from the city man
I hate my job and I'm sick of my shitty band
All I can do is get drunk as the night is long
Stay inside and get high just to write my song
My girl's at the corner bar getting blasted too
She'll be back just a few minutes after two
She gets pissed cause I sound just like her dad
I pop shit like who picked up your tab?
Go ahead and cry yourself to sleep
And I'll pour another drink for myself to think
But best believe when the VCR clock says four
Guaranteed I'll be knocking on that bedroom door
Switch it up, sing a different tune
Creep beneath the sheet and move in for the spoon
With my hands on your hips cause I'm asking for sex
With my cigarette breath on the back of your neck
Yeah, it often happens out of habit
Open door like the grocery store, automatic
Go deep, ocean floor, smashed in
Buzzkill for asking if she faked the orgasm
