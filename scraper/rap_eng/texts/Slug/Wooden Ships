[Verse 1]

The shock value shook me off
Adrenaline like a rookie cop
Can I turn the siren on, please
Never before have I been so secure with my reactionary inability
And she's killin' me again
It's the same old tale
I've been murdered a million times
Some how I keep coming back to life
Same mountain, I continue to climb
And I'm not as confused as I am considerate
Back and forth between my cigarette and her clitoris
I'm workin' on both like it's nobody's business
Such an odd way to gain god's forgiveness
And all of my friends believe I should forgive myself
They insist that I've done nothing wrong
But I'm not convinced 'till I finish every bottle on the shelf
And I've run out of reasons to write my songs
And all of her friends think I'm holdin' her back
It's beautiful, but they don't know the half
They're barely aware of a fraction
Blinded by dramatics
Ignoring all the passion

[Hook x4]
Wooden ships, on the water
Rescue me

[Verse 2]

The clash of the titans
To balance the excitement
Challenge the enlightenment
And flash my vice grips
Maintenance man, keepin' faith in my plan
If it's possible, I'll fix it
And if not, then I'll kick it
There was a time I would follow wind into a storm
And all I wanted was for someone to keep me warm
But now I'm torn by my tolerance
I fight with my head
I don't need to pollinate a flower that's dead
And everyone I've built, I watched wilt
And everyone that has built me is killin' me
And as much as I love her
Neither one of us should suffer
So I'm a glue both the wings back on and watch her flutter
Go fly butterfly
Don't cry shut your eyes
Gonna watch each other die
Before we give it another try
Hover little hummingbird
Dart through the sky
I've been under the thumb
It's no wonder I'm still shy
Hunger, onward, with my desires
Learned the hard way not to play with fire
From a comfortable distance, I'll admire
Because I got to take a break
I'm exhausted, I'm tired
Hunger, onward, with my desires
Learned the hard way not to play with fire
From a comfortable distance, I'll admire
Because I got to take a break
I'm exhausted, I'm tired
