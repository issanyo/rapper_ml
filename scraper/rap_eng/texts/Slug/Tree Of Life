[Hook: Logic]
I read this thing from Atmosphere the other day
It spoke about music we love and music we hate
I don't know why
But I can relate to this

[Verse 1: Logic]
Rap, bitches, money, cars only take you but so far
I can guarantee you that shit don't make up a super star
Time place, all good, wilin' out just like you should
Let your fingers do the talking in person I wish you would
God damn that's my jam, let me get it like this my man
Even though nobody don't understand like, like, like, like
Hold up, what's the hold up?
You like what you like, she like what he like, he like what they like
They all hate what you like and you like fuck 'em all
So much division my vision is faded
We all from the same tree but you leaves degraded
Judging the different branches in music that elevated
Just cause it's further from the roots don't mean that you should hate it
Cause there's a time and place for everything that's been created
Damn, see in the end we all fam'
But all that really matters is I know who I am

[Verse 2: Slug]
Nobody gotta agree with me, I'm just being me
I keep breathing my speech, you be
Comfortable if we never get to speak about it
You'd rather hit your hammer, just leave without it
We got a lot of light for the storm
With more shine than that lamp keeps your food warm
And the truth is un-disputable, it's beautiful
It should be considered the usual
So I ain't judging you for loving it so hard
But you disregard that we've all got old scars
My skin looks like bark
They used to do it out in the park
Pretend to defend or neglect to protect
Depends which voice the rain reflects, connection
With all the blood invested
You would think it was the love that made impressions

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
My woman is a smooth vision
Aye, she my muse and I'm a musician
Love her cause a couple things she do different
Me and her be whipping running and getting money
We usually put that Pimp and Bun in and count a hundred
Listen sonny your honey won’t play that 8-Ball & MJG
I suggest you quit her now cause that bitch won't keep it G
Cause I’m an outlaw, need a ginsing for my waiter
Bobby we the Marley, high and holy, we inhale it, exhale it
Early Sunday morning, on fire getting higher
To the sounds of the Georgia mass choir
And I swear to god you ain't ever really smoked reefer till you do it to to the sound of Aretha coming loud out your speaker
Bridge over trouble water and my heart
What God has brought together let not man break apart
I swear I ain't a pair around fucking 'round with us
Cause we be like it's Pimp C bitch, now what the fuck is up?
