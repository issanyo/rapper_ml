I can see the writing on the wall
Maybe I'm denyin' all my flaws
Maybe she's the one that got away
I'll probably bump into her at LA
I wonder why I'm so secretive
When now-a-days nobody can keep it in
If I told you you probably won't believe me
Like what you 'gon do to try and please me
You don't really need me
You just be you and Imma be me (you just be you and Imma be me)
We can agree to disagree, I don't eat pork
But just cause the meats on your fork, don't mean we can't consort
The hardest thing I had to do (what was that?)
Was realize I ain't as smart as you
It's ok though I'm faithful, you're for me like halos for angels
Let's change the ratio and say fuck all these racial woes
America the beautiful, but bitch you gotta take care of ya cuticles
I gotta use the studio, to tell you what you should know
I don't kick it with biggets, and I don't picket to fix it
Let's talk about the money, ohh nahh, ya memory is fuzzy

[Hook x2]
Walkin on a tight-rope tryna get across
One wrong step and ya boys 'gon fall
Walkin on a tight-rope tryna get across
I don't know shit but you seem to know it all

So why you try and stress me out?
Check me now, GPS re-route
You wanna test the limits, tolerence
Are you prepared to commit to the consequence?
I've got work to do, I should sit back and observe your moves
But my attitude is burn the school
When you accuse me, who you tryna persecute huh?
This ain't even a tight rope cause a tight rope is strong enough to hold us both
The best thing we can hope is to look below and try to find a way to land after we let go
Look out! Step back, I'm makin' my impact hit the blacktop runnin'
Like the cops are comin'
I'm plannin' on, still standin' strong, with a new tight-rope for me to dance upon, c'mon!

[Hook x4]
Walkin on a tight-rope tryna get across
One wrong step and ya boys 'gon fall
Walkin on a tight-rope tryna get across
I don't know shit but you seem to know it all
