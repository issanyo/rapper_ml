[Verse One: Blueprint]
They used to look down on him just cause he was short
But despite his height he could still throw it down with force
So if he had a first love it was probably sports
Before divorced his old man would take him to the courts
It made him smile just to spend time with his dad
But after a little while the basketball was all he had
They use do call him fag, they neighborhood drama bad
He'd be out hooping late, shooting j's till his mama mad
He made it look easy, seemed like every shot was hit
But he can't enjoy cause he'd wonder where his papa's at
A lot of tears five years since he saw him last
But even then he's still picturing him smiling from the stands
Can't concentrate, grades start dropping fast
Can't pass his whole attitude is fuck a class
It's obvious he's got too much time on his hands
Fighting in the schoolyard going hard throwing hands
The other guy didn't have a chance
One big blow took him out and put him on his ass
He walked home not surprised that he won again
Didn't know the paramedics came with the ambulance
So when the cops rolled up he didn't understand
Why a little scrap had 'em putting cuffs on his hands
The reason he was treated like a wanted man
Is 'cause the kid he knocked out never woke up again
Offered scholarships, every college hollering
They all wanted him but all he wanted was his father back
Now he's locked up and he never gonna ball again
Lost everything over something he would never have

[Hook]
Who do you love?
Just let me know
Tell me how much
How far you would go

[Verse Two: Slug]
And there he goes again, yelling at the front door
"It's four o'clock in the morning, what you want boy?"
Grown kid locked out of his own crib
Cause the life he chose to live is making mom so sick
He crushed her, just a youngster
When she first discovered he sold drugs to make the bucks work
Years of tears, fear of the police
It was relief when the kid became a tweak
She ran through the standard phases
The guilt, the anger, all the cracks in the pavement
She didn't have any time to raise him
And the boy just turned twenty-nine - a basehead
On the porch, sleeping on the floor
Sometimes you forget why you carrying a torch
Already stretched past what she can afford
That ain't your baby boy anymore it's just a corpse

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Illogic]
Hold on for your life and don't let go
Even though it's going nowhere you won't let go
It's suffocating, trying to breathe but you won't let go
'Cause you know how much you love it this is how you show
It's begging and pleading, please let go
'Cause if you keep me trapped in a box then I can't grow
You understand the necessity cause you been there befo'
And that's exactly why deep in your heart you can't let go
You'd rather live for today then die for tomorrow
C'mon, loosen your grip and just let go
Your reality is paper thin so if you let go
You'll realize no escaping when the machine gets broke
Just let go, swan dive off the cliff and just let go
If you want what you're holding to live you gotta let go
A freedom only you can give but you won't let go
How can someone that talks so fast walk so slow
Gave up your rib now emotion you borrow
Scared to live but not to inflict sorrow
You think you'd be alone again if you just let go
'Cause that's what happened the last time you just let go
You watch it crumble before your eyes, this finds you depressed
But not surprised cause in your mind you can't let go
And as it slowly dies you realize that each tear you cry
Wouldn't be a lie if you'd had just let go

[Hook]
