[Chorus x2]
Death, murder, and mayhem
Push me to the brink and they got me debating
Death, murder, and mayhem
Now I want to go outside and paint the pavement

[Verse 1]
I heard my hood was a joke to y’all
I used to think about smoking y’all
Late night in my crib playing Dreamcast
Nine cocked back, all black with a skimask
Talking shit like I wasn’t gonna hear you
Standin' across the street with the heat in the clear view
Took my stories all make-believe
Pushed to the front line then forced to take a leave
Say 316 was made up, step your rap game down and your street game up
Ever seen gunfire lighting up a staircase
Ask the enemy how the gun look in their face
It’s so serious, you dudes listen to these rappers cause you’re curious
It’s all real, only three basic principles
Death, murder, mayhem, no one is invincible
Or undefeated in the streets
Hell I don’t beef with MCs who get their ass beat
All up on Youtube running their yap
I ain’t trying to get caught up with none of you cats
That would be the end of so-called gangster rap
Cause as soon as I call my gangsters it’s a rap
Lines like that is why gangster rap suck
And that’s word to the tears on the face of Young Buck

[Chorus x2]
Death, murder, and mayhem
Push me to the brink and they got me debating
Death, murder, and mayhem
Now I want to go outside and paint the pavement

[Verse 2]
I hate life cause I hate my boss
I’d walk off the job, can’t take the loss
Paranoia that he might lay me off
I promise to God someday he’s gonna pay the cost
I dream about killing sometimes
Booze, weed, pills, nothing helps unwind
I’m done trying to find sunshine
I could be an Internet punchline by lunchtime
They wanna overwork me
They trying to hurt me but now I’m just bloodthirsty
First we make him scream like a girlie
Then gag him with a shirt sleeve and show him no mercy
He’s out of shape, I’m younger, I’m sturdy
I ain’t so early that I don’t know how to carve a turkey
Plus I’m clean, I can purchase a burnie
And put a couple black eyed peas up in his fergie
Attitude check or catch a wet rack
The rug’s a red mat cause he got fed the lead Ex-lax
Leave you dead flat on your dead back
And let your neighbour kids poke you with a stick like a dead cat
Do it right with the human rights
If for no other reason than losing life
And maybe you should try to watch what you say
Cause today just might not be your day, c’mon

[Outro]
Push me to the brink and they got me debating
Death, murder, and mayhem
Death, murder, and mayhem
Push me to the brink and they got me debating
Death, murder, and mayhem
Push me to the brink and they got me debating
Death, murder, and mayhem
Now I want to go outside and paint the pavement
Death, murder, and mayhem
Push me to the brink and they got me debating
Death, murder, and mayhem
Now I want to go outside and paint the pavement
