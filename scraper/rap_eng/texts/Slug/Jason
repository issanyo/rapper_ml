[Jason: spoken voicemail]
Yo Slug, this is Bird, man
Hey, haha, dude it's raining outside
And umm, I'm waiting on you motherfuckers again
Nobody's answering their phones
And uh, I got the van packed up
Ready to roll, we're checked out of the hotel
All's I need is rappers and DJs to get in the fucking van
So, please man, hurry the fuck up
Cats Van Bags, yo, k?
