Be my woman tonight
Just ain't feelin' right
Be my woman tonight
Just ain't feelin' right

Hey lady, I don't mean to be so forward
But I got no other choice, soon I'll be across the border
Tourmode, I'm leavin' in the AM
But I wanna spend this evening breathing in ya fragrance
Too long since I've seen my better half
Sometimes you gotta let go, close your eyes and let it crash
Road to life is the only one I have to give
Lonely isn't a strong enough adjective
To describe all those nights that I've tried to grip tight
I lack the necessary tools to help me get right
So take your place as the temporary savior
While I'm looking at your face like I'll be tested on it later
I bet you like to fuck, but you love to argue
Poke a hole into my chest and pull my heart through
Up to my room for cigarettes and cartoons
Or we could sit right here and try to guard these barstools
I'll take you anyway that I can have you
Bring along your ethics and your issues and your taboos
It's not the standard "Free Bird' situation
But you're talking to these pieces of a man whose trying to make it
Through the puzzles, travels, struggles, battles
The body pillow pimp trying to snuggle with my shadow
We could stay proper keep the clothes on, no pressure
Just hold me and pretend like you've known me forever
Won't ya..

Be my woman tonight

Damn, why'd she have to leave right after the show
All that eye contact made from the front row
Them vibes I was getting man I thought it was a go
Could used that type of company, you just don't know
I been on the road for like six months straight
Only two days off between all of them dates
The hardest working man in the underground game
Most times I'm too tired to hang around and spit game
Most nights are the same, shows is just like work
Leave the stage, stand around, selling merchs and shirts
Then I peeked her pink skirt out the corner of my eye
By the exit posted up like attack, looking fly
I tried to play it cool, but I coudn't pretend
So I approached hella anxious with a silly ass grin
She said she dropped off her friends, so we could be alone
Gave her undivided attention, turned off her phone
Took me out for pancakes, paid for the dinner
Then took me to my room, let me watch sports center
And then we made out, and then we made love
And then I passed out while I got a backrub
But in the middle of the night I reached for a second helpin'
Got a hand full of sheets, I was all by myself an'
Before you could say: 'Goddamn that sucks'
JayBird called: "cats, van, bags” … FUCK!
