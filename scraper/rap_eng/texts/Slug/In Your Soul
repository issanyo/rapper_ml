[Sample]:
In your soul, there's a lullaby

[Hook] [Samuel]:
In my soul
In my soul
Da da da da da
In my soul
In my soul
Da da da da da

[Verse One] [C-Rayz Walz]:
Everything's sacred in my left arm sleeve
My right arm, shoulder to palm read "hip hop" to me
Both limbs the perfect balance, Radio Raheem
Here me doctor?
"In your soul"
Always do the right thing
Love and hate
Confusion and understandin'
Able to sit with it and still take it on a tangent
A gut feeling
Intuitive action
Provin' this thing on the whole
Is just a fraction of what's really in control
What's within your soul?
In the music box, the pretty pixie dancing
The roots to the tree bark at the dog, noises chanting
The perfect picture of pain
Posin' with poison
The bottom of sneakers I ain't right
"In your soul"
These are the choices
The fish I eat
The voices I hear
That no one else does
Or do they
Hallowed be the name say Deja vu to self buzz
Too formless to shape up
Young fresh when I begin or without my shell
I'll be within my soul

[Hook] [Samuel]:
In my soul
In my soul
Da da da da da
In my soul
In my soul
Da da da da da

[Verse Two] [Slug]:
When I wake up to the sun shinin' down on my physical
Sometimes it's difficult for me to get my vision so
I'm squintin' at the ceilin' waitin' for the paint to peel
Just to reinforce the feelin' that I believe in is real
But my soul never needed validation
So I get up, stand up to get some elevation
And I make my preparation for the day like any other
Hustle through the puzzle tryin' to guarantee my supper
I'm not perfect
The proof is in the poison
But I try to keep the balance with the movement of voices
No lies let loose, truth recognize truth
Gospel, that's why you let it inside you
(Boom)
Consume
You're just a cocoon
Until the angel within gets to birth and bloom
The growth is more than just a flow and a track
I don't front so my soul watches over my back

[Hook] [Samuel]:
In my soul
In my soul
Da da da da da
In my soul
In my soul
Da da da da da

[Verse Three] [Sum-In-1]:
My swagger that of a god
I'm way ahead of my time
As soon as I hit the booth, I'm runnin' it down the line
Believe it, goin' for mine
Undoubtedly in control
Yo, you got to feel this
"In your soul"
Yo, see I'm pavin' the way to walk
You standin' on shaky ground
We hit you from different angles
Like this is surround sound
The symphony's gonna play another classical piece
Inherit the soul of James, we takin' this to the streets
Spittin' nothin' but rhythm, nothin' like helium I could lift
Like a buffalo soldier, always give it the twist
Hip hop my first love, the moment it took hold
Not a reason you can't breathe this
"In your soul"
Yo, disregarding the hardships, I'm keepin' my game tight
Reincarnated, (died), came back the same night
Celebratin' my life, can't stress over the enemies
Withstand the test, I manifested my destiny
Stay up

[Hook] [Samuel]:
In my soul
In my soul
Da da da da da
In my soul
In my soul
Da da da da da
