[Verse 1: Le]
Drive fast like I stole the shit
Fuck the hoe like I owe the bitch
Most imposers been over with it
You don't know me homie, don't bro me, slick
Pockets straight 'cause I paid dues
In position 'cause I made moves
Been speedin' lately, I can't cruise
Best check the record, I can't lose
Same game, 'nother level
Different type of glow, he special
Skate highs, kickin' them pedals
Switch up on 'em, nah never did that
Only write them lines if I really did that
120 on 610, baby, I do laps
That's about it, it's no lie, pimpin', it's all facts
'Bout to open the shop up, do what off rap
Do the opposite of real, what do you call that?
Nah wait, snake eyes, feelin' y'all hate
Hoe shit, dog, I just can't relate
Wanna build a brand in the crib like Migos
'Cause a rap nigga never been my heroes
Steak with the shrimp every time we get paid
Surfin' the turf, couldn't ride my wave
Low key with it, gonna stack up right
See 'em crapped out but I'm standin' all night

[Hook: Left Brain]
Roll the die, snake eyes
Ridin' round, all I see is snake eyes
Fake hoes, fake guys
All up in my face, boy, I know you lyin'
All up in my face, bitch, I'm lyin'
Made a bad bitch and she make pies
Gotta stay strapped with the .45
Watch you niggas with my snake eyes
Roll the die, snake eyes
Ridin' round, all I see is snake eyes
Fake hoes, fake guys
All up in my face, boy, I know you lyin'
All up in my face, bitch, I'm lyin'
Made a bad bitch and she make pies
Gotta stay strapped with the .45
Watch you niggas with my snake eyes

[Verse 2: Dro Fe]
Gotta watch the hoes with the snake eyes
Keep a .45 by my waistline
Got a bad bitch on my FaceTime
Seen a hater so I left a hater face die
All these niggas wanna come kill me but they ain't killed nothin'
Bitch, I'm out Cali with a couple 100 G's with a bitch, gettin' blunted
Where are my haters though?
I'm outchea just scrapin' up major dough
Had a yellow Benz but the yellow Benz gone
Couple hours to replace the hoe
Nigga bumpin' on the internet
Nigga done with your interlect
I got a couple 100 shooters in your hood
At your face, all up in your neck
Sippin' codeine with the fam again
Ain't no plug, use a middle man
Gotta make the paper
Make the paper chase the paper
Stack the paper in a pyramid
In the 'burbs where my kids live
It ain't a murder, no witness
Niggas better watch their mouths
'Fore they end up at the bottom of the ocean in a fish net

[Hook: Left Brain]
Roll the die, snake eyes
Ridin' round, all I see is snake eyes
Fake hoes, fake guys
All up in my face, boy, I know you lyin'
All up in my face, bitch, I'm lyin'
Made a bad bitch and she make pies
Gotta stay strapped with the .45
Watch you niggas with my snake eyes
Roll the die, snake eyes
Ridin' round, all I see is snake eyes
Fake hoes, fake guys
All up in my face, boy, I know you lyin'
All up in my face, bitch, I'm lyin'
Made a bad bitch and she make pies
Gotta stay strapped with the .45
Watch you niggas with my snake eyes
