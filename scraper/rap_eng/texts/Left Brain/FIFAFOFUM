[Verse 1]:
Bombs away, I'm out in Wonderland
These rappers so 2000 like the Naked Brothers Band
They say behave, they'll never understand
I made it from the gutter to a house right next to sand
And they can't stand Mad's the man, and I'm stealing all their fans
I'm your favorite rapper
Agree I'm top three cause I'm similar to NAFTA
You'll never stop me, I'm the sensei and the master
As we proceed, I come in first, they coming after
And I stay clean, yea I have the dope-st swagger
Dapper, doubter
How you doing, tired of these snitch wack rapper coons
Claiming that their goons packing six click-clack booms
Never fed a spoon, I just pimp slap backs in tombs
Mad you a fool
I don't see how I could ever lose
My flow contagious, kinda like it has the flu
Been a ball-er status, crossing over call me Uncle Drew
Always do me, think it's time for you to do you
All these gurus be like "Mad you a cool dude"
Show my respect, then I stunt like

[Verse 2]
A-Jack
Girl on my beanstalk, it's black
Girl on my beanstalk, she cryin'
Girl on my beanstalk, it's giant
At this point I don't run the game, I fly it
Still searchin' for my sound, just wait I'll find it
For now Imma drop songs that'll start riots
I'm the dream like Hakeem, remember no Lyon
(Bow)
Do it for the check, we don't do it for the check
Cause this money she could blow, we just do it for the neck
FIFAFO-, yea you know what's up next
No sleep just thinkin' how much better it could get
Thankin' God everyday, cause you know your boy is blessed
Ballin' out of control, see me saucin' like Steph
Make it with my eyes closed, yea you know my shot is wet
Been a PLAYA all my life, keep that title till death
Do us part, we gon' start
A new era of this art
In my heart, I have starved
To become a blazin' star
Watch my dreams become a reality, I'm gaining the audacity
To say rappers can't battle me, battle me
