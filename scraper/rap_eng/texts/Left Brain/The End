[Intro]
Yeah, ayy

[Verse]
Fresh tee, shirt, pants, shoes cut
All fresh, less in the game
In the steel, feel like all mix
Two bad bitches have a wet t-shirt contest
Niggas want me to spot in the [?] call the [?]
Blang! I'm about to flex on my ex
Biceps, triceps
Bitches talk about "I'm wet"
Popping opioids like Kanye West
Made it at the hotel, dancing
I'm 'bout to check out
'Bout to check in in the hood, had to see what's good
Go and check in on my mama
I'm gon' check in on the traphouse
'Bout to crack safe, bring the racks out
The boys want work, but it's stacks now
Work getting cut, bring the axe out
Small circle, don't get X'ed out
I was waitin' to stick my chest out
Mind Gone is the best out
Small waist with her breasts out, ooh
Small waist and some titties
Got me throwin' ones, fives, tens, twenties, and fifties
Juicy J, I'm trippy
No bread, I'm trippy
Pourin' red in a sippy
Dirty cup, Mississippi
Dirty South fuck with me
East side fuck with me
West side fuck with me
North side, North side, North side
And we in the Bape just for the day
Go pick up some grapes, got you some A's
Fuck with the apes, don't make no mistakes

[Outro]
Slide through your hood, nigga
Mind Gone, Mind Gone, Mind Gone, yeah!
Mind Gone, nigga
You already know what the fuck goin' on, 2018
Volume 2, album done, nigga!
We gonna eat from above, nigga, asteroids falling down on earth
It's the end, nigga
