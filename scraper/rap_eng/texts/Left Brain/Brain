[Verse 1]
They said a piece of my ambition's ambitious
Hat back, snap back, Brooklyn Мишка
Movie role, studio, rubber grip in my cuticles
Coohie yo the stupid ho who fall for cupid doe
I can't fall in love with a bit of shit
Cause if I fall into it, it's being used and then quit
You more on the bitch, I'm on the analog sticks
You can quote me on my sentence nigga, catalog this
Odd Future wolves, ain't some passive artists
A bunch of massive artists, hang up, I had to call this
We mosh through streets like a pack of walrus
So when we come around them niggas had to ball fists
My swagger is natural flavor, then citric acid
Honey ginseng if it's extracted
And honey's with me if she's attractive
Her address, I address, my hoop in her basket

[Hook]
Man, when it came to school, I got bad grades
Now, when it came to the law, I didn't know how to behave
My nigga but with music, music, music
I'm on the honor roll, honor roll, honor roll
With music, music, music
I'm on the honor roll, honor roll, we on a roll

[Verse 2: Domo]
Threw my condolences to bogus shit, cause I'm killing shit off
Survival on the love boat, I'm kicking every bitch off
Phone book flow, this some shit you'll never rip off
Shitting on you niggas, I'm a level past piss off
Risk all to get all, I'm all in
Leaving every bar spin, getting paper, I don't do go cigar, friends
Give me a couple seconds, I'll be leaving with your girlfriend
Gotta get in fresh, got her mouth full, gargling
Spit it out
Dealing with the mary by the big amount flying from a different route
Money 'bout to come so these bitches trying to stick it out
You ain't special though, give me neck and then I kick you out
Domo Genesis, it ain't nothing next to that
Aiming for success and won't fall for nothing less than that
Wolf Gang shit, got all my niggas repping that
If we ain't it yet, somebody show me where the best is at

[Hook]
