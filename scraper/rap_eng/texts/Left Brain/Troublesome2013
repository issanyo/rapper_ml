[Intro: Hodgy Beats]
The shroomie Left Brain, he got the bass and the line
But where them drums at?
You know what they say about that bitch Karma
They say she come back
I'm living moments truthfully honest right now
Probably because of that
Constantly looking for where the trouble at, bring my
Pieces to the pie, I better double bag, or it's over

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Well, I got trouble on my mind but no emotions on my sleeve
I heard that love'll get you killed, so who gone show some love for me?
Fucking never need it, push against the grain until my fingers bleeding
Smoking weed and tweaking trying to figure out a deeper meaning
Dog, I'm sick of this bullshit, and being broke'll
Make a nigga empty a full clip, when your back against the
Wall, you only think about hood shit, they trying to box you
In a cell in front of that pulpit
Ashamed what they give us, fill the corners with mad swishers and liquor
And can't seem to figure why niggas seeking schemes to get richer
They'd pull heat out frustration, blow off steam on a nigga
Just for the love of fucking green, I'm praying Jesus forgive us
I hope the Lord has mercy and Karma ain't much a bitch
I hope the truth is settled, corners, they compensate what we miss
Hope they cut you out the circle, you got the heart of a bitch
All I fucking got is hope, it's like love just doesn't exist

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I say we work to die, smoking eases aggravations
But I got to learn patience, and quit running, just face it
Give money to the homeless while I'm pumping gas stations
It could be me in their footsteps, but it ain't and I'm grateful
Spring when it is not April, surf and turf on the table
This is the will and our power, shit, I know that I'm able
It's time to jump the cables, work to keep it stable
And once your horses stable, your life is sweet, maple
Nekcihc deirf elffaw a no greens
This world is colder than a bitch, well, ho, I swear I'm mean
Can't put me down I'm dope, use and share with fiends
View the rarest team, the most unbearable schemes
We're the terrible dream, I'm talking parable means
22 with a kid almost two
What it do? Taking care of mines. My lawyer by me with no
Facing fines, so I ain't facing time, this face, it shines
Nigga
