[Verse]
No longer focused on my broken ways
All I know's the only way is to get loaded paid
But funny how the changes turn page when the dough exchange
Got me trying to float away
Back to red Corolla days
Back when we used to have to scrape the door to blaze
Before the game showed us things we had the moments made
Before this shit got so insane
Before relationships caught growing pains
Back when you had to let 'em know your name
Before you realize that no two niggas gon' grow the same
Live it the way you like it, but never play with time
Feel it in the spot on my own cause I never stay in line
Things change but niggas get stuck in ways sometimes
Minutes turn to days sometimes, and love turns to hate sometimes
And to the time limits stay in the game
We just playing, we ain't creative
Found a way in this maze
Pray the vision out the way
I see the shit in my brain
While I'm gripping grain down memory lane
In my red Corolla

[Outro]
Switching lanes in my red Corolla
Switching lanes in my red Corolla
Switching lanes in my red Corolla
