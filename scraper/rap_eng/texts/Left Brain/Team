[Verse 1]
I said, two dope bitches wanna diss on a blog
When they can't see through this Odd Future smog
Odd Future wolf, you a premature dog
I burn your whole website like it's a fucking log, uh
I'm past dissing and now I'm admitting you to
Come to a show and check out our performance
They feel us deep inside like a pains in the organs
We make it rain music, when it rains it is pouring
Niggas only holla at us when they want something
Fuck 'em all, no drawers, homie you get nothing
And you can label me the asshole, buttcrack
I ain't wack so I'm everything but crack
Tyler get it off my shoulder, dust that
All of you are spitting fiction, and we're just fact
Odd Future Wolf Gang, bang bang
We on our Odd shit, you can't do the same thing

[Verse 2]
I have about sixty minutes to ease you
I'm so sick, my contact would disease you
Kill 'em all, I could lyrically decease you
Hold on to your earlobes as we release two more tapes
A bunch of fun, more rape, corruption
Man, we monster truck in the street, sweet destruction
Odd Future Wolf's niggas seeing where you go
Addicting babies in bellies chasing at the Juno
Why you hating on us cuatro, we numero uno
On top of y'all, on top of all, we the shit, rock the stars
Fuck the rules, box the brawl, make sure we pack 'em tight
We get haters confused like hermaphrodites
Half man, half a dyke, I'm half dead, half alive
Cracked hands flash the light, put 'em in the air
Put 'em in the air, nigga put 'em in the air
Rep O.F. like you just don't care
