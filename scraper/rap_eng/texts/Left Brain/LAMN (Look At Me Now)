[Verse 1]
I want a brand new whip
I think that these niggas would too
When you making money and you acting so new
I ain’t really fly, I just copped some Bape shoes
I don’t really like lies I don’t watch the fucking news
How you got a girl but she fucking me tonight?
Can’t fuck with the lames, you ain’t even living right
My team say, fuck 12
I’m just smoking J's tonight
Feeling like the young nigga Dynamite

[Chorus]
I want that new 'Rari
I want that new money
Smoke too much I got munchies
Back then she ain’t even want me
I want that new 'Rari
I need some new money
Smoke too much I got munchies
Back then she ain’t even want me
Look at me now, look at me now
Look at me now, look at me now
Look at me now, look at me now
Look at me now, look at me now

[Verse 2]
East side shawty got a check
Fuck a lil bih for the neck
Nigga locked up can’t call collect
Don’t want me but she want sex
I’m on the flight just chasing that jet
You know the top good, feel it in your legs
You know the top good, feel it in your legs
You know the top good, feel it in your legs

[Chorus]
