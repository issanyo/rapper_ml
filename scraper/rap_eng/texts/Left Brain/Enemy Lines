[Chorus]
Behind enemy lines
Behind enemy lines
Behind enemy lines
Behind enemy lines
There's a black hawk down
Behind enemy lines
Yeah, yeah
Behind enemy lines
Behind enemy lines
There's a black hawk down

[Verse 1]
I was trained to train my brain to be sustained
[?] a game
A dollar means to dream again
I gotta be a Peter Pan
Not to be [?]
Least that's how they treat a king
I signed up then the [?] came
I'm just trying to feed my family
You're just trying to eat off fame
Heroes we're heroic, note it
I'ma fiend, my arms is dope for this heroine
Keep moving [?] locomotives
Won't be here again
We keep it moving
Choose who I listen to, hearing aid
It's clear to say I'm here to stay

[Verse 2]
I'm legendary
There ain't many, heaven sent me
Been special ed since elementary
And I've been fly evidently
And I got drive, in the driveway there's a Bentley
And I got bars, candy bars [?]
Hearing [?] rambling
Blowing kush, I got quarters in the back, Peyton Manning
This game I play, hate the gambling
Nigga you should honor me
[?] place of sanity

[Chorus]
Behind enemy lines
Behind enemy lines
Behind enemy lines
Behind enemy lines
There's a black hawk down
Behind enemy lines
Yeah, yeah
Behind enemy lines
Behind enemy lines
There's a black hawk down

[Verse 3]
Emblems, syllables don't represent or resemble individuals
They pitifully shit on her, typical
For these [?] extra decimals
That get technical for those reciprocals
I tried to shape it up, cylinder
Senator you're not president
Peasant this game ain't minituar
Immature listen up perpendicular listener, life's a bitch and I'm into her
Hitting her from behind enemy lines
She sit on my dick and my mind yeah
Completely opposite addition of mine is
Allergic to bullshit [?] my sinus
[?]
Dynasty power diamonds respect iron
[?] that lion
Lions King set, Messiah
Bling drip, it's shining
Went from defeated now I'm completed
Shit who I am
Supplying [?] behind these enemy lines
Who am I?
I prophesied, do or die
You decide who am I
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Walking through the fire, crucified
Confusing [?]
Staring through these eyes
Fiery eyes walking through the fire
Walk straight through the fire
Prove that I'm immortal
This beat was made by Left Brain
Walk through the portal
Join these forces that don't support us
Checks in order, your debts and mortgage
The best in all this
Anointed, I'm the bestest artist
I'm gassing up hessing [?]
In the morning prepare my porridge
Like I'm famished, tornished
But this man is [?]
Sting like a bee, like a hornet
