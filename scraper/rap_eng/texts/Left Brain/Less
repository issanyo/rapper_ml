[Bridge]
I never trust these hoes
These fucking rusty hoes
They have disgusting goals
They wanna cuff and hold

[Hook]
A nigga with dough, M-O-N-E-Y
Rubberband rolls, M-O-N-E-Y

[Verse 1]
When I had nothing she looked at me like I had no swag
Now I pop enough tags to fill her garage like a shopping bag
Less about the size, more about what ass counts
Currency amounts 'fore I go to college
And try to bounce to the ounce cause (?)
I'm under her radar only cause I'm in Fader
She ain't my bitch, she's know way I'mma name her
No monopoly, I’m a tax bracket gamer
Blackjack and hanger, can't blame, cash stacks
Is what attracts the danger, attack with anger
React me hang her uninvited stranger
My pockets she try to rip out
Done dug so a big whole now the bitch try to get out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
I said I’m riding round town like I got diamonds in my body
I’ll be shining on these niggas got you main chick in the lobby
I am on some higher level shit I’m Rastafari
She ain't seen nothing like it, like the crazy stories on Maury
I get money, not in college, I spent all my summers touring
Another round killing her softly, I call that bitch Lauryn, ah!
High off trees and I'm gone in the spot
See you tryna get on top and she better make it drop
I got knots in my pocket, girl my tolerance dropped
Thermometer pop everything I drop hot
