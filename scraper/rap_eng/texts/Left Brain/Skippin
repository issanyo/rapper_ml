[Hook]
I'm just chillin' on the block
I'm sippin' lean and eatin' chicken
Got a play up on the line
I hit the house and then I'm dippin'
I'm out skippin' straight to the fuckin' money
Another three piece sold
We going loco with the money, nigga
Chillin' on the block
I'm sippin' lean and eatin' chicken
Got a play up on the line
I hit the house and then I'm dippin'
I'm out skippin' straight to the fuckin' money
Another three piece sold
We going loco with the money, nigga

[Verse 1: Left Brain]
Ridin' down the five
All that's on my mind is homicide or suicide
Should I kill you or should I kill myself
I've been thinkin' bout this shit all day, I need some help
I just kill shit, kill that weak shit
They say I'm a freak, I need a freak bitch
Back in high school I said I'd never be a trash man
But these stanky niggas got me takin' out the trash, man
I was never popular, I was just a fuckin' lame
I still ride the fuckin' train, I ain't like drivin' cars
Fuck the fame, yeah they say that I'm a superstar
Fuck it, I'm a superstar

[Verse 2]
High town on the block you know I'm servin' it
I can't trust these niggas man, to me they all some serpents
Ridin' down i35, you know I'm swervin'
But you know workin, do it for a purpose
Off a couple percers, niggas know you worthless
With my Pocahontas, she be snatchin' purses
Pull up with that racket motherfucker, clutch city
I might fuck with you but nigga, he ain't fuckin' with me
Let me talk to 'em, Jigga plays off the line
Ballin' till I get a fine, got the money on my mind
Niggas know I'm comin' down
Gotta represent the crew, rest in peace to Yams too
And we doin' what we do, nigga you know I'm just...
