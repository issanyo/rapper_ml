Jump off, jump off, jump off, jump off, jump off

Jump off, jump off
Jump off, jump off, jump off, jump off, jump off
Tell your bitch to jump off
Jump off, jump off, jump off

[Verse 1: Left Brain]
Jump off, jump off
We off the wall
Tell your bitch to jump off my balls
I'm so high I'm about to jump off
Flier than Aaliyah, I'ma disappear
Call me Magic Mike but I ain't a queer
Diamonds dancing on me, look me watch 'em stare
She gon' hop in that passenger and just watch me steer
She gon' roll that dojo and she watch for po-po
I'ma keep on sipping and me thinking I'm slow-mo
Hey I ain't afraid to let that pop off
And my bitch, and she ain't afraid to let the gun off

[Hook: Left Brain]
Jump off, jump off, jump off, jump off, jump off
Tell your bitch to jump off
Jump off, jump off, jump off
It's about to jump off
Jump off, jump off, jump off, jump off, jump off
Tell your bitch to jump off
Jump off, jump off, jump off
It's about to jump off

[Verse 2: L-Dog]
Like a NBA game boy we bout to jump off
Step up in this circle yeah and we finna square off
This the type of shit to make a nigga lose his mind
Special shout out to all my niggas out here stay committing crime, ayy
Hit a lick, bust a pack, bust a counterfeit
This for all my niggas out here on that trapping shit
Start off with a O and build it to a whole thang
Send you to the East Coast, now you trapping mane
Cause it's a fucking jump off
Shit harder than a bitch, nigga it's like we got the special sauce
So best go and get yourself a lil taste
And if you disrespect my niggas I'ma punch you in your face bitch, trust me

[Hook: Left Brain]
Jump off, jump off, jump off, jump off, jump off
Tell your bitch to jump off
Jump off, jump off, jump off
It's about to jump off
Jump off, jump off, jump off, jump off, jump off
Tell your bitch to jump off
Jump off, jump off, jump off
It's about to jump off

[Verse 3]
(Yeah, L-Dog, Left Brain)
Hoes saw boots like Timbalands
On nuts like M&M's
Jump off fuck once now call again
I'ma go and fuck all their friends
Bitch I know what you want
Wanna make yo' sis a aunt
Wanna fuck me [?]
Wanna show me to your mom
Bitch you thought, what you on
This look good, I'ma take some
Kit-Kat with the legs, I'ma break some
Call the 7 [?]
Niggas mad they ain't me so they hate [?]
Niggas fraud that ainâ€™t A1
I be laughin' at 'em like a nigga watching Martin on Trayvon
Your bitch [?] she could jump off a roof
Bitch jump on my Twitter, I just out the coop
Me and Left Brain fuck your hoe
Duck your hoe and you love your hoe
Like a fire drill how I got your hoe
Make a girl stop, drop, and roll
Why you playing, this ain't recess
Got killer hoes, devil's rejects
Me and my niggas we next
Get Kenny Chesney on the remix
