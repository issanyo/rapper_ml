[Verse 1]

Ahh, my verse come fast like a gun blast
I don't need a gun, I don't need it, naw
Marijuana breathe, I don't need the rum
You can keep you some I just drink for fun
Billboard cover when my eyes roll back
Domo right behind me fittin to roll another sack
Put your lighters up like your life is on wack
So you light to me nigga I even got tax
And I paid that shit (got my way) like I paid that shit
I'm gonna grave that shit im in the graveyard
Employee on the job you can ask my manager
I'm the cancer that's for damn sure
Smoke in Amsterdam and had a joke
Apply CPR if your ass start to choke
I see Mary Jane and she getting kind of close
Her face is on my book and she about to get poked

[Hook]

I am now taking...shots

[Verse 2]

I'm honored to be a monster
My monsters postrous upon us
Gobstoppers and marijuana
Ga ganja trauma your mama
She'll take us off to the doctors
And buy us brand new pajamas
I think I'm hallucinating
In aggravating these llamas
The room is getting smaller
Get mommy, somebody call her
I'm throwing up in the hall
My fingers feel like marshmallows chocolate
Maltings with frosters
Caramel on a saucer
My visions begin to alter
Wavering like a ?
With no appointment in the ?
Niggas afraid of success and recall it
I ball it, then broil it
Can you grab the foil bitch? I'mma wrap it up and just save it for my enjoyment
I get more thumbs up then a corn flake
Wolfgangs the gang you wanna join with (bitch)
No sentences after that
I shatter facts with pack gat rappers, Lucky ass bitch
