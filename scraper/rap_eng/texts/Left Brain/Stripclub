[Verse 1]
Uh-huh, I know you like this
I'm strappin' on the magnum, I ain't tryna have kids, huh
I'm 19 and my pockets like an old man
And you a golden girl fuckin' with a gold man
The world shivers has you hold on to my cold hand
Strip tease please like I don't know how to slow dance
Single dollars being thrown from the back
I got that white girl, if you skinny and you black
Backshot, mascot, hair longer than Rapunzel
And she be rollin' up my trees from the jungle
To top it off she call me Daddy
Playin' a game of nine holes, golf clubs and the caddy

[Hook]
Broads and panty hoes in the strip club
There so many hoes in the strip club
Takin' off they clothes in the strip club
Knees touchin' elbow in the strip club
(Drop that ass fast, pick it up slow
I do it for the show, girl you do it for the dough)

[Verse 2]
I'm realistic and hella up-hillarific
There is no concealin' this shit, she is ready to fuckin' peel bitch
On some G shit, kush and G strings
And stayin' true to only about three things
Get money, kill 'em all, Wolf Gang nigga
Luxurious just like that Wood Grain nigga
I pack a lot I got a wood brain nigga
Try and keep her with my team but she would sprang, nigga
Me and Left Brain are in the strip club
Next to showers of bitches like we're inside a big tub
Uhh, I'm tryna get my dick sucked
Put my sportin' goods down so you could pick a dick up
Shit, what am I pose? You want boss and the clothes
With no drawers, just for less like Ross

[Hook]
