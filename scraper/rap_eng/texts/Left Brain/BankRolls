[Intro]
Man one day I'mma get there
I'mma be counting up all these bank rolls, nigga
(Right, damn, we gon' be getting all the dank dro, rollin' up)
Man, I'mma be fuck with a model bitch, no stank hoes
(For sure man, we gon' be countin' all the bank rolls)
All the bank rolls

Hodgy Beats, Left Brain
MellowHype, huh, Odd Future, huh

[Verse 1: Hodgy]
First one up, yup, good mornin'
I'm already out the door by the time you were yawnin'
Head start for the green mow lawnin'
Prolongin' in the game sing-a-longin'
Bounce if you like, come on bob your head
Obey every single word that Simon said
Blood Diamond flow, it's shinin' red
What's up with your hip hop? Mine is dead
Wolf Gang bred, cookin' bread
If they ain't associated, I don't shake they hand
Pretty-ass nigga with a girl from Japan
She don't speak any English but she understand
So in demand, I'm him the man
The music plants the cash in-hand
I can't be concentrated on what the press might hear
I buzz unless in the light then how did I arrive

[Hook: Left Brain]
What the fuck you thank, yo? I be smokin' dank dro
You be fuckin' stank hoes, I be countin' bank rolls
I be countin' bank rolls, I be countin' bank rolls
Fuck you nigga, I be countin' bank rolls
To the bank every week
Y'all already know, I fuck with the freaks
I be countin' bank rolls, I be countin' bank rolls
Fuck you nigga, I be countin' bank rolls

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
You know it's odd when I come through your area
Cause you scared of a monster, tell your uncle I'm scaring ya
Workin' on my form, MellowHype bury ya
626 I'm your local carry, yeah
Nothin's set in stone 'til the stones are set, ah
Probably break a sweat until my bones are wet
You want me to give like there's nothing to get
But there's nothing to get, just music to share
We've got music to spare, like it's musical chairs
Beats are the truth and lyrics take dares
And I'm comin' after whoever want it
And I swing for the fence nigga don't pitch
Home Run Derby I don't miss
Then I go home, eat beans, scrumptious
Mellowhype is better than the rest
Better than the next, and , better than the best

[Hook]

[Bridge: Hodgy]
I be countin' bank rolls, I be countin' green
Count so much money, need a paper machine
I be countin' money, I be countin' paper
I be countin' bank rolls, I be countin' bank rolls

[Hook]
