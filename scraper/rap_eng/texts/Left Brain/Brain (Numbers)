[Intro: Hodgy Beats]
I ain’t walking in the dark with my eyes closed man fuck that

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Mama told me to use my brain
This is how I explain, exploding like a plane crash into a building
People speak with no effort of thought hope or feeling
That’s why the youth is fucked up now, adults killed them
I’m speaking ‘cause I’m one of them my sister is another one
You know that uncomfort numb?
Nightmares I’m still running from
But I run from none, teeth gold like I’m Southern
I won’t be quitting and spitting until I’m number one
And the funny thing is I’m only twenty-one
You niggas tummy tucked, your music sucks
You're just another one of them niggas who think they know it all
Well I know one thing, that boy is sure to fall
Wolf Gang

[Interlude: Hodgy Beats]
(You just think you know god damn motherfucking thing!)
No, I don’t even think I know everything man
(You don’t know nothing about life!)
What you talking about?
(The hell wrong with you? You need to listen to me!)
I am listening
(I’m your elder! I’m your Grandpa!)
Grandpa why you tripping?
(Shit!)
Man I’m out of here!
(Come here boy!)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I ain’t playing with my life no more I'm taking it serious
I never took shit serious until shit got serious
Niggas I hope you hearing this bitches I know you feeling this
The sky ain’t the ceiling take off the top unrevealing
The world's a hungry villain corrupting the lovely children
That’s such an ugly feeling, that’s such a bloody dealing
Nobody wants you winning it, rather see you getting booked
Finger prints and mug shots from guns caught in drug charges
When a man’s just trying to feed his family something so harmless
The bigger picture enlarges in the hood we are a carcass
In the suburbs we’re labeled targets
Can’t even walk my ass through Target without getting targeted
Ready to kill us all and get us carpeted

[Closure: Hodgy Beats]
Fuck that nigga, shit, (brrap-brrap) fuck that nigga
Put my motherfucking gun up nigga this is USA bitch
