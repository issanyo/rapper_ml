[Verse 1]
My fire scorching, it's red
People raining on my name, can't change a scorpion's prayers
Niggas tryna' sue a younging at an unfornuate bread
Told my son that I'ma kill till every portion is dead
I mean that, back when I was his age, my momma would tote the switchblade
Cause out in Trenton, niggas wasn't bitch made
When I grow up, I'ma get paid and treat everyday like it's a big day
And have all these hootchies ride my dick, like a big wave
Smoke till my mind gone
Some where else, in a different time zone
HB baby, he gon' get his shine on
Worry about what I'm on, nigga what are you on?
Food 4 Less and coupons greyer than the news, uh
You hating on the truth, uh
My minds gone, the roofs gone
Tahoe and the coupe
How about 80, what it do? uh
I'm hot like when your food come
Me and music having two sums
On the cool drums, cruising through slums
Windows crack cause I blew one
My flame is torched and it's blue
I'm going to the source of course to get my Pep√© Le Pew
All these niggas talk like hoes, don't wanna step and dispute
Cause my presence bulletproof and we destined to shoot, rahh

[Hook]
I do it to the fullest
I do it to the fullest
Nigga, I do it to the fullest
I do it to the fullest
Bitch, I do it to the fullest
I do it to the fullest
Little homie, I do it to the fullest
I do it to the fullest

[Verse 2]
I'm practicing on my bass guitar
And tucking Mary Jane to sleep in a Cuban cigar
My niggas talk when there is beef, man, I put that on God
Rest in peace, I hold my piece
Between the sheets like Isla
She come with more than one freak, I'm all about variety
Moving silently, quietly, hybridly, no dividing me
If I go, I'm going violently, rioting fragrant firing
I'm the nigga for the job you should be hiring
Got a good heart corrupted mind that needs some rewiring
But I do my deeds when needs are met which makes me inspiring
Niggas deals fucked up mad at us, you shouldn't have signed no contract
While I'm on tour running wild in Australia like a wombat
Golf Wang tom cat, said you dropping bombs
Well motherfucker, where your bombs at?
I blow, where your time map?
And record it on the time lapse
'X' marks spot, nigga, Imma find that, you better recline back
And take a chill pill this the motherfucking climax
Word to real is steel, turning tables getting highjacked
These niggas know the deal and you hiding behind the blind fact

[Hook]

[Outro]
