[Intro]
OFM, banging on your FM

[Verse 1]
She said that she like my stylo
She just hate the fact that I act like Ne-Yo
She my sexy love like Ne-Yo
And she get it wet, all net, free throw
And wherever he go, she goes
And wherever she go, he goes
To France, we go, romance, sing slow
Come and be with your man, dingo
Crispy like a Pringle, singing like a jingle
She give me fresh kisses like she bilingual
Shorty, my French kiss her
Hold my hand so tight man I got a couple blisters
But she cheated on me so I blew her to smithers
I'm in denial talking about I was never with her
Cause she was with another when I wasn't with her
Want me back now is you can keep that nigga

[Hook]
Smoke some kush with me
Roll the L with me (Roll it up, roll it up)
Take it slow with me (Let's take it slow girl)
Blow some dro with me (Let's blow some dro girl)
Smoke some kush with me (Smoke it up, smoke it up)
Blow some dro with me (Let's roll it up, roll it up)
Smoke some kush with me
Take it slow with me

[Verse 2]
I keep multiple women and I do it for a reason
New chick everyday and they're fluent for a reason
I live a fresh life where everything is new
I can put it on my card and pay when everything is due
"How is everything, Hodgy?" Everything cool
Well I'm glad to hear that everything is everything boo
I don't know about you, but I'm on my mind to get stacks
You fade like jeans, like pants you slack
I wash the crease out you, let you dry on the rack
Intruder Mr. Computer, there's a loser tryna hack
But you can't hack a jack, kick em' like a hacky sack
I get to giggling because you niggas are a laughing act
Now how fad is that? I mean how laugh is that?
I mean I'm laughing like I'm in the fucking laugh factory
Man I said this story, now I'm gun get this glory

[Hook]
