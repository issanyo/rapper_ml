[Verse 1]
Smoke weed, hash on, wax off
I enter the building they pledge and take they hats off
If they don’t, I’m a dog with a bone in a scrap yard
Front line, nigga, you chilling the backyard
No punchline nigga, I ain’t tryna act hard
I’m on the clock, swishers in a fucking time car
Monsters attacking I got the fuckin’ mars bars
That pistol whip is sitting on my Santa Claus draws
Who in the hell you thought I was, that fuckin’ Flog Gnaw
Give your bitch my golfballs and hit it raw dog
Cross me and hitting shots like my nigga Brian Shaw
I’m feeding them cold cuts with a side of coleslaw
(I’m a Rough Rider) And left brain my road dog
With that 4-4 gadget watch them go, go off
Up in that 6-4 wagon with the chrome doors floss
Bad bitch in the passenger with the rosegold jaw
See we used to be scavengers, now the world is ours
Bitches gassing me up like Texaco
I spit that shit that them niggas shipping from Mexico
Pitch it to civilians and sell it back to the federals
We the agriculture got niggas watching cholesterol
Picking the skin off chickens and skipping on grandma’s dinner rolls
I’m hitting the thickest women, Sicilian bitches are pleasurable
I'm lifted nigga, let's get it, taking bites out of life’s edibles

[Verse 2]
Oh “H”, Don’t let nobody snake you
I know you misunderstood don’t let nobody mistake you
That’s why you cutting tracks like slices of grapefruit
Touching down and touching back, niggas will try to play you
Relay you and Delay you the main reason you stay true
Hateful towards your nature I don’t even gotta say who
Growing weed and California and I got my seeds from Beirut
‘Bout to open up a shop and serve it ‘till my brain loop
I got niggas in the hoop and riding solo in the trucks
Smoking up windows inverted up I don’t give a fuck
Counting cooches cutting corners
And she don’t want to come for it
Come to conclusions that’s what she wear her Pumps for
If we fucking she boosing we killin that pussy dumb sore
I do this for my amusement music's my fun and joy
Puff puff pass hit you can hit the blunt boy
I’m barely in chicago I’m bringing the illest noise
Get a boy, wondering where I be like tity boi
Will destroy anything you suckers will avoid
Lions tigers and shrooms, I’m in Neverland
Getting high as fuck hoping I never land
Wishing you were a wishing well playing a better hand
Knowing I’m not a veteran make me a better man
Pretty soon I’mma be ballin’ while these bitches tetheran
Fly as a fucking feather amongst my brethren
