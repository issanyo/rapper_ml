[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Look, before I'm gone
And while I'm here
I promised to never
Live a fucking life of fear
Promise I'mma give a good fight
Just might do it right
Get a fucking insight the peer's
Minds in gear, never been the biter
Of a bullet, where the killer
Lay it up and pull it
Ride it to the fullest broke with some [?]
Mellow out in this bitch
We gonna be standing here till your hype dies
A top of a mountain full of pride
Making all you fuck niggas look bite-size
The civilized streets made us
Every day I breath, but I feel like God hates us
With a little weed to fill the hiatus
Satisfying greed as we divide faces, face it
Basically my face could be
Whatever I say is me, I ain't make believe
If I can't succeed you're going
To be the first one to bleed, please dawg, why you take from me?
Cus' I'm reckless nigga sipping of the bottle
With a death wish nigga
Waiting for my time, I'm restless nigga
Real one till my death, till I rest
No breath, God bless this nigga
Look, it's golf wang bitch, niggas better stay
In your lane bitch, smoke a lot till my
Brain split, MellowHigh bitch I can't quit
(Ugh, I can't quit, Smoke a lot till my brain split, MellowHigh bitch I can't quit)

[Bridge: Hodgy, Domo & Left Brain]
Hell yeah, niggah
This shit amazing
I can't belive, it's like unbelievable amazing (Pour Up)
I can't even grasp it in my mind (Sip on whatever)
How crazy this shit is
It's motherfucking mellowhigh
I'm just young
I got all the bitches all, all everything that
You don't have I got I possess it, hallowed be thy name
Bitches can't not fuck with this shit
MellowHigh nigga I'll slap somebody in the face
If they say otherwise Nigga
I put that on everybody I ever met in my whole life
(Get me a motherfucking uh beer right there out the motherfucking refrigerater)
I swear to god (What's going on man) I'm so thirsty for this shit
(Ay man turn the channel Ay put on that motherfucking)
I'm not playing not fucking games dog
(Ay uh Ay my nigga turn the playstation on)


[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Every morning is different
Different mary, same expression
I see my vision clearer
Nigga watch who you addressing
Spilled yoohoo on my shirt
Looks like balsamic salad dressing
My professor wanted a thousand words
I added a thousand weapons The world a stage full of those
Who reenact the plays I be one of the few
With ten box seats and never paid to watch you slaves
Life is what you make it
And you're just a maid
Mellow High, three men, we got weed
We niggas with the teamwork
That's why these niggas shredded
We live movies, that's dreamwork
Realities be headed, don't look
At me with that petty smirk niggas
Get sucked out no semi-burst
Bitch, I break your nose and
Fuck your show, they coming
To America like I'm Eddie
From private jets to the Euro star back to L.A.X I'm a ghetto star
No drug dealer but I pedal bars had handle bars
So high the devil dance with stars MellowHigh on Juipter and Mars
We flying, fucking rockets blowing up your cars, nigga
