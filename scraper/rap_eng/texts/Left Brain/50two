Fuck everybody

(Nigga, yeah)
Fuck everybody

Nigga fuck everybody

[Post-Hook]
Middle finger to the niggas that doubted me
Fuck everyone that's proud of me
All of ya'll can suck my dick
(Fuck everybody)
I'm young but I'm ready to die
Swear to God if I lie
Put a fucking hollow point in my eye
This is for the books, put one up in the sky
Fuck now, let's roll up
We just tryna get high
Uh

[Verse]
I feel the people lurking on me
Bitch I'm making moves
If the boot fit him
Lace it and take his shoes
Nothing can stop me
Try to slow me down and take a snooze
Higashi Miyagi
That lil nigga Rogie just made the news
Who pressin' charges on me
In the nigga six three
Shouldn't have walked up on a g
I told that bus stay where he be
Fuck batteries, fuck a casualty
Fuck a badge and his motherfuckin' faculty
Fuck a fuck nigga come beatin' after me
I'ma fuck all these bitches chasin' after me
Who you thought it was
I'm the [?] you shouldn't a brought it up
You should mark it like a coffee cup
'Cause you ain't bossin' up
Feelin' lost as fuck
And you fallin' down the hills you keep crawlin' up
I [?] my fist of your eyes bubblin' up
A war from my aggressors
Who you callin' up
Criminal threats on the monitor
Niggas exaggeratin' I promise ya
Your honorer
If I go, I go 'til I conquer her
And demolish her
Life's a bitch when it polish ya
Fuck taking credit
I'm a [?]
Don't slap the cuffs on me, officer
But you know how it goes
They take me and book me
And then let me go
'Cause that nigga's a bitch
And they know how it goes
