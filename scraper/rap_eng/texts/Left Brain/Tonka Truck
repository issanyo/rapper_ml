[Verse 1: Lil Ugly Mane]
Yo
Bourbon in my dixie, I'm a bully on a bullet
Pull up to the function, mobbin' nature to the fullest
Rap life, big shit, tell them hoes to pull up
With the foolish intentions, and the booties with the juicy dimensions
Shoutout to Petey back in Richmond city
I'm finna run the game playa, you can run it with me
We finna bring the pain just to keep the shit 150
VA on the bubble, you in trouble if you ain't with me
All these dummies really wanna be Ugly
But it's tips if you ain't with the clique
How you got a smile on your lips, when your whole style hangin' off the dip
Run up on 'em quick with the Kangol fit
And thats facts, most MCs laughable
But I'm laid back with the Backwoods, casual
Ugly man and T in this bitch, LB on the mix
Hoe we gettin' hella rich and thats it

[Hook: Antwon]
You ain't tryna feel that nigga
We in the Tonka truck, makin' big boy noise and the homegirls feel it
Style so sick, you know my kids had to steal it
You don't even pay homage lil' nigga
Playin' like a pimp, you fuckin' the same bitch
Probably scared of them drugs, lil' nigga
I'm in Seaworld vibin' while the whole world dyin'
You can't even take a ride, lil' nigga
In the Tonka truck, makin' big boy noise and the homegirls feel it
(Feel it)

[Verse 2: Wiki]
Lil' me, but a lil' bigga
Younger, learned from ya, made me a lil' realer
He got a whole lotta feelings in him
He was my older brother, mothafuckas now we really winnin'
I ain't like all them other children
I'm short, I ain't ever gonna reach the ceiling
I am willin' to do anything to reach a million
But imma split it with the secret circle, we be chillin'
Y'all actin like ya know what's up, who's in it
Only slowed up once, (yeah) that was just to roll up blunts
I ain't gonna grow up, go up, I ain't with it
No, I ain't with it, I don't know what's up

[Hook: Antwon]
You ain't tryna feel that nigga
