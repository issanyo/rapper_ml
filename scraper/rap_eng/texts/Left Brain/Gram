I'll bet you never heard some shit like this before
Mellowhype Blackenedwhite is too original
Give me the snares, give me the drum, rotated with the hi-hat
Let the music paint my destiny so I don't buy maps
Toasting champagne, flukes and wine caps
Purple kush got me sleepy I'm about to take a nice nap
Baby compare your man to me, uh, I'm twice that
He keep you up all night, I put to sleep night cap
I'm killing you niggas and that's a bright fact
If Christ gave me this gift of a talent well then can Christ rap?
Swastika letterman jacket, nigga you like that?
Lookin for cheerleadering groupies and booties I might sack
Lineback, Hodgy Beats, I'm back
Mellowhype, we're it, with Bastard generics
Kill Them All, smear it all in your mirrors

[Outro]
Mellowhype is too epic
You better fuck with Odd Future
If you don't fuck with Odd Future, fuck you
