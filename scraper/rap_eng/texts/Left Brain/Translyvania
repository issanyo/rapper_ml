Blank page in a total rage
Going through an arms race with a tank phase
Threats from a couple lames
Probably for they nostrils, I ain't saving face
I got lemons made lemonade
Lawrence Class the lemon man
Get pie like lemon meringue
Fuck a bitch come back like a boomerang
Dracula spit no fang
Hit it then I quit it in the fucking rain
Get lit fuck the money and the fame
Never dash for the cash I ain't fucking Dame
Any day any game any age
Fall back like the bitch got Aids
Lawrence Class the new craze
