Yeah
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yah


Said I'm Sammy with the hits
Sosa with the wif

Said I'm Sammy with the hits
(And the roids)
Sosa with the wif (get em boy)

Drop an album for a Grammy
I'll be Ron, you a Tammy
Anxious and a lil clammy
Out the park gram slammy

Blowing smoke in here
Wearing locs with hair
They shake with fear
Touchdown in a city
Kinda savage like 50

Beats for the accessorize
Fresh until I fucking die
High can't see my eyes
Cause I like my weed vaporized

Shake your hand then sanitize
Either that's joints or swisher sweets
Sorry if you texting me
Probably in the booth or sleep



Said I'm Sammy with the hits
(And the roids)
Sosa with the wif (get em boy)

Said I'm Sammy with the hits
(And the roids)
Sosa with the wif (get em boy)

Isreal
Gone tell
You what you need to do to keep your ass out of hell
Sammy sosa wih the hits
Israel is my clique
Kicking knowledge without a drop of college
Head of class I sit
Brothers know your worth
Since Day One since birth
King he preach
Amongst the savage beast
God saw to the earth (?)
The world will do what you do
The words I speak are true
Obey the truth and teach the youth or these curses fall on you
