[Intro: Left Brain]
Southside, soutside where you at
Westside, westside where you at
Northside, northside where you at
Eastside, eastside where you at
Southside, soutside where you at
Westside, westside where you at
Northside, northside where you at
Eastside, eastside where you at

[Hook: Left Brain]
Let me tell you bout that southside, southside
We goin' to the strip club with them gold mouths
Let me tell you bout that westside, westside
Niggas always outside, better be [?]
Let me tell you bout that northside, that northside
North, north talkin' triple six, bout to sip a fifth
Let me tell you bout that eastside, that eastside
Talkin' bout that east coast goin' beast mode

[Verse 1: L-Dog]
Let me tell you bout that westside, shorty take a ride
Yeah LB rollin' blunts then it take flight
We smokin' up niggas, we takin' off like a jet
Slide through the function with them hoes that's a bet
My nigga let 'em break it down like a dealer with an ounce
Turn it up on these niggas, we steal their bitches then we bounce
And it's back to the hotel spot with it
Now that these niggas seein' L-Dog bitch, I'm too [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Westside Inglewood, stackin' paper like a book
[?] and I guess I just get back to cookin'
Whippin' on the pots, [?] hustlin' on another level
Fuckin' with my paper, leave your brain nigga in a shovel
[?] I'm half off the hustle
Poppin' pills, sippin' lean, smokin' like the mufflers
[?] family first ask my lil brother
And you might think you somethin' but to us it's really nothing

[Hook: Left Brain]

[Outro: Left Brain]
Southside, soutside where you at
Westside, westside where you at
Northside, northside where you at
Eastside, eastside where you at
Southside, soutside where you at
Westside, westside where you at
Northside, northside where you at
Eastside, eastside where you at
