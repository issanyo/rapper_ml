[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
A fan will spot me like a fuckin' giraffe
I'm schoolin niggas coolin nigga
I ain't fuckin' with class
Countin' cheerios I ain't talkin' cereal
You pussy niggas venereal it's that time of the month
I spark in the dark like I'm lightin' a blunt (blunt)
Slide up in a drunk cunt and give her what she don't want
Im smokin' she snortin' up pepper
Like Jordan my bitches assortments
I make em' important
Your bitch more like a 'mmmm iggght'
Nigga mine is gorgeous
No chicken head
I'm gettin' head while gettin' bread
I live a stead to make your life a livin' dead (get it yeah?)
I'm like a riverbed with a vocab
My technology is programmed to smoke grams
Go ham
This just one of my slow jams
Pull the Dom Perignon and the Ace of Spades
Get drunk on you bitch-maids
Lemonade
Bittersweet
I ain't in the hood but I'm in the streets
Just ask my name bitch

[Hook: Hodgy Beats]
You know my MO
Extra'd out ammo
My fingers ticklish like Elmo
Maharishi camo
You little niggas nano
The first movement since the chicano
Quesadilla with the carne asada
Viva Zapata
A fiend for the ganja
That's me
Pack it in the bowl with golden spoons
Put the stems in hot water like we cookin shrooms

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Fuck your fuckin' assumptions
I get it bumpin' like acne on a preteen
Puffin' mean green till my world feel like a green screen
Started off a nightmare now I fuckin' eat dreams
They been fiendin' for the shit that we bring
We the redeem team
Bars like singsing and I'm about to spring clean
Knee scenes
I was born to run Bruce Springsteen
Son of a bitch and a half trick
I spaz shit
9 lives left to react bitch you catnip
Swag sick
Turn a snobby ho into a bagged bitch
Swag like its crack on deck
The fiends backflip
Lay that wack shit in the casket
Bum ass raps with no point like a cracked wrist
And I been at it for a year and a half
Fast motion
Same lane gearin' the gas
And I ain't fuckin' with these niggas all I'm hearin' is trash
I fuck with gettin' paid nigga all I'm hearin' is cash bitch

[Hook]
