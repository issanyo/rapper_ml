[Verse 1: Left Brain]
Lil' mami got an ass like a mami do
But I'mma spank that ass like a papi do
You in trouble, la bonita, with that attitude
Red lipstick with the tattoo
We in that '63 Impala bangin Big Pun
My other la bonita rollin' up a big one (roll up)
Sexy cholo baby ridin' with that big gun
My Spanish model bitch, she a thick one
Now we in Miami drinkin on tequila
Can I have this dance with you Miss La Bonita? (yes)
Salsa, cha-cha, blah blah
All I want is la bonita by my side
This song ain’t only for the Spanish girls
(Namsayin it’s for all the girls around the world
I love all girls
Bonita apple bum, you got to put me on)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Damn! How'd you get your ass in those?
I love it when she bends over, touch her calves and toes
A few sins in my amusement park, don't abuse it
With your loose friends, never catch her in some loose pants
I'm too in, tooting as she beep beeps
And I ain't playing with physique, chick Higashi beats cheeks
I skeet skeet a mountain, but not while she bouncin'
On my vertical joy ride, dead legs, sore thighs
If you're Dominican, I love hispanics
My Puerto Rico mama speakin' me Spanish
They cook me them steak tacos, side of rice and beans
I bought it, you take the offer, give you the finer things
It's ridiculous, how promiscuous
She looks delicious put her name on my hit it list
Get it bitch, if you ain't got no hoes dawg, you should get a hitch
I'll call it quits and take it hype across this cits, hey bitch
Girl why you pullin' on my shirt, you a flirt, huh?
Came through cause your man done did you dirt, huh?
And I fuck you good, I make you squirt, uh
Just keep talkin' that lala as I observe, huh
Somethings been wrong with me, lately, chasin' these ladies I'm crazy
For la bonita, I freak-a-lika in Hiroshima
To kick it like a sneaker that’s cheaper than that punchline
La bonita bitter sweet, punchline!

[Outro]
I be rolling through, coming through
Holdin' you and pullin' off all of your clothes, get it three times in a row
I be rollin 2 blunts, and smokin' you out and your friends
Cause they know I fuck 'em too cause they hoes
I be rolling through, coming through
Holdin' you and pullin' off all of your clothes
I be rollin 2 blunts, and smokin' you out and your friends
Cause they know, toe to toe, whatever goes
