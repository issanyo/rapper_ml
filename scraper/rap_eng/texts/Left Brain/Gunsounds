[Intro]
Where, the, fuck, is, MellowHype?

Where is MellowHype?

MellowHype, Black&White, bitch!

[Verse]
Ay; I never think too hard, I always drink too hard
Pair of panties, two bottles; nigga I floss they floor
Nigga pick up ya jaw, nigga hit up the law
Drop wolves, pop fools, leave him hit like his bra
You either witness or not, we tying niggas like knots
Bloody nose full of snot, Odd Future gold and you rock
Over the stove and the pot, them bullet holes and you drop
64, low-low, full of hoes gettin cock
Uh, I'm off the chain, consider a loose dog (Oh)
I make it rain, consider a new fog
Precipitation, condensation
Conversations, obligations
Taking place when in the basement
Of hatred where Satan's waitin
For me to pull up the whip
Swagger got an upper lip
Lesbians gotta cuff their chick
Around me cause I'll fuck they bitch
I'm ripping through these speakers
Like I tripped into to these speakers
Mascots and cheerleaders
Ballers whistle wit your sneakers
George was worthy to ocean
Earl was shipping them coffins
Cause we selling that frost, that stone cold, that Steve Austin
You can't get this shit for free but you can get it for a fee
You can take her on a spree, finish up and bring her to me
Finish up, bring her to me; we ain't going on a spree
I don't have to pay a fee
Cause bitch I get this shit for free
Difference between me and you -- opposite maganets
See me I'm living straight while you taking turns faggin it
Left brother wanna take a drag from it
Inhale, exhale like a dragon bitch
Got a monkey and a carpet like Aladdin did
Get ya swag from me, then rap this shit
You shop at K Mart, I shop at AK Mart
I'm aiming at they heart -- nigga better duck if they smart
Where the fucking guns at?
