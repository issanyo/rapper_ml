[Hook]
I ain't bullshittin (wait)
And I ain't bullshittin (hold up)
(x4)

[Bridge]
You buster ass niggas ain't smokin as much as I am today (smoke)
As I take a puff and walk by you, I blow the kush in your face (smoke)
If you have nothing to do with getting money, then take a step away (smoke)
We got family extended, like clips that are in need of some haze (smoke)

[Verse 1]
Waiting on shorty to come home and give me a swish
So I can put my weed inside of it, and lickity-split
Bitch I roll a fat blunt, the size of chimney's widith
Green like Jiminy Crick, somebody lend me a bic
Killin' flows and blowin' O's is what I like to do, my ritual
Or ritual, bending words ignant pitiful
Reason why niggas ridicule, but fuck em, they ain't nothin
Amsterdam shag in my weed, I'm puffin

[Hook & Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I'm takin syllables and whippin miracles
Fuck a Cheerio, killin cereals, I'm a criminal
Me, despicable you do the minimal, this shit is pivotal
Gotta get it by the principle
Gotta strike it when it's lit, you know
Gotta light it, hit the spliff indo
Been smokin for a decade, it's habitual
Loud individual, I shine like an emerald
But keep it simple though, unless some niggas start trippin ho

[Hook]
