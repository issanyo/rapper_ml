[Prod. By Left Brain]

[Verse 1]
I’m on a roll like a hundred spokes with so many flows
I could compose a dose of dope, coming with the okie doke
Yo bitch I pokie poke, Vinny run it don't ya know
These bitches think I give a fuck, I could pop a downer
Drowning in my sorrow, i’m on Pac’s corner serenading
The pulsation of my lyrics, leave your spirit penetrated
Motivated with these stanzas for the fans that awaited
Never will never had satisfactory, one man tragedy
Pressurize audacity, strong arm steady, Phil Da Agony
Feel the agony? I align ya with catastrophe
Put your favorite MC in atrophy, fuck ya gimmicks
Dispatching my casualties, with nines and buck tin in
Got the pen with a voodoo doll, cold as Lou Rawls
Duck these fuck faces drag em out like RuPaul
Aim for the grill like Paul Wall, word is bond
Schizo on the beat i’m a traumatized war vet
Cut from a different cloth with the bars I crochet
From sun up to sun set son set it off i’m so vexed
I’m still prime time like Deion, yet the most slept on
I’ll get your dreams impeded on, turn blocks into Elm Streets
My mental is higher than Tom Cruise Vanilla Sky is
The flyest and yet the highest, all you write is pilot
I’m on the next episode, my weapon loads and aims bias
At these half ass rappers thinking they shits hot
Make em kiss the dirt, now he down to earth like Chris Rock
Get yo bitch to hop, on my john, invest stock she lick cock
Take her to Lucy’s diamond, in the sky for a pit stop
Stash under the sole of my Ewings, i’m Huey Newton
On use of illusion, too elusive for Confucius
Been alluded to this music for years being a student
Of Jigga, God’s Son, Makaveli, Big Pun, and Biggie
Son of a legend sorta like Ziggy, piff in my lungs no ciggy
Outshine these poets while most MC’s have sleepovers
Juxtaposed to all the realest homies that seek toasters
Down and dirty like E-40 with the click
Hitting licks my daily routine, back when I was thirteen
BB Daytons on my ten speed, red bones creep me in they teepee
She make that kitty kat purr at me i’m feeding frenzy
Hydrocodone shouts my man Pimp C, i’m leaning with the Zan
Menage a trois, with bitches looking like Gina and Pam
Goddamn, soap suds on my nina, she scrubbing my dino
Feeling like Prince Zamunda, moneys the root bitch im Kunta
Stoned off the buddah that Medusa i’m a mind ruler
Keep more k’s, nines than groomers, you gone need a tutor
Your shooters are Ferris Buller, need a three piece suitor
When we ride slow, disturbing the peace like i’m Luda
This that Amityville Ronanld Defeo flow
Hip-Hop’s new edition, you got that Ron Devoe flow
Bow down like you was posted up in a mosque floor
Pirrelli’s in front of Roscoes, with yo dame after eight eighths
Of Grape Ape in my Bathing Ape, got her ass about face
Haters gone hate, suck on these after I scrape the plate
And just in one take, i’ll get the studio sautéed
And you can get exposed like an R&B sex tape
Comedy rappers Russell Simmons should host your mixtape
