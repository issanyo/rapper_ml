[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Cold water, fresh from every aspect
It's like I have eight ligaments the way that I grab checks
I'm passed go, puff it, then pass next on ratchets
I'm 007 make a nigga grab his gadget
Barbarian with the harpoon, don't walk in that dark room
Leave your organs on a barstool, then bag 'em up, carpool
Hodgy, he so devilish
Elevator, next level shit
I'm going up but it's going down but I never settle bitch

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
All these fucking drugs and no motivation
All these fucking girls and no home to take them
All these fucking plugs ain't no where to gauge them
Call the sluts to roll the blunt I'm guaranteed to face them
My power's like a horse's, you know where I race them
On the track where I practice careers for the takin'
I'm swollen aching, smoking eighths and go defacing haters
You slow deflate, that's your mistake, I'm on the road to mayhem

[Hook: Left Brain]
Here we, here we, here we fucking go (go)
Here we, here we, here we fucking go (go)
Here we, here we, here we fucking go (go)
Here we fucking go, let these niggas know (know)

[Verse 3: Hodgy Beats]
Smoking flights, roll the dice, I'm sober like I should have flown a kite
I got the calmag like dolomite so nigga don't step to me you a shoulder's height
Not a soldiers height, I'm cold as ice, frozen bitten
North Face mittens, on a mission
Left in the kitchen, I'm finna chef in the kitchen
..I don't raise hell til its risen
Cos' jails are forbidden, and it's for a kitten
I'm pissing and shitting on rhythms
It's given,the sky is the limit
Like ribbons and flying pigeons
Live and die my religion
Got my eyes, so I ain't tripping
Eye's witness,but I ain't snitching
Feds in my ear, but I ain't listening
Dora the Explorer, hora
The horror hoarder
Daughters in storages,ransom mortgages, no cash shortages
All this oil is lit, she gone boil quick
Torture is tortoises slowly punching their torsos
Selling narcos in boroughs like Mexicans and their churros
Who is him and them, deminem
The antonym rambling
Mosh and squash the dandelon
MellowHype throttling canvases
And won't pay for no damages
We ain't that nigga
If you wanna fuck some shit up though
We'll paint that picture
