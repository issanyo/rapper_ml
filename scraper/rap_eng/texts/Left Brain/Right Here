[Intro]
Oh, oh, slow down, ha-ha
Left Brain is a beast, ain't he?

[Verse 1]
Can all my sexy ladies wave your hands right here?
This track is peanut butter, so we jam right here
I'm flirting with you in your ear, and your mans right here
Plotting on how I'm gonna do these fucking skins right here
Fellas get them hands higher, smoke them grams right here
Model chicks walking by and it's your chance right here
Confidence is a reality, your friends might fear
But I'm coming out this club with some twins, my dear
And we headed to the whip where we can smoke right here
Got the girls, got the Henny, got the coke right here
Now she calling me her baby like I'm in a high chair
I swear, I fear not a thing right here

[Hook]
I kick rhymes all the time, I get high all the time
Can't nobody stop the vibe that I'm feeling right here
Bitch, dimes on the grind, you can't cop it for the nine
Can't nobody stop the tribe and how we living right here
And we rolling, weed rolling, we smoking, we blowing
And can't nobody stop the vibe that I'm feeling right here
And we rolling, weed rolling, we smoking, we blowing
Can't nobody stop the tribe and how we living right here

[Verse 2]
How you feel about me caressing your blessings? Lesson after lesson
Like an adolescent that constantly getting in trouble
That bad ass need a whooping, whoopie cushion belt pushing
With the wolve in his nature, group huddles?
The kush is in the jar and the blunts are in the car
Blow Indian Indica cause like Jafar we be who we are
And we do what we does cause we does what we do
Spark the weed, Pikachu, pizza, booze, we can chew
And drink the same time and think the same mind
Mental telepathy, leprosy, legacy, running through
My legs and feet, walking what we preach
We don't gotta teach, just put one in the air, my dear
I swear, it's hundred percent everything right here

[Hook]
