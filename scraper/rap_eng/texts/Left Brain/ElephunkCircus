[Intro: Left Brain]
Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls
Thank you for coming out tonight to the Mellow fucking Hype circus
Left Brain, Hodgy Beats, lions, tigers, bears and wolves
Hold on to your seats people

[Hodgy Beats]
Mellow as the ocean, Hype like my nerves is
It's MellowHype in my ElephunkCircus
Music waiter I serve you like a clerk did
9 to 5 and I don't even like to work shifts
Hindu fires light the life of the party
On your mark get set go, get them engines started
Lions, tigers, monkeys locked away from the audience
Clowns running through the crowd fighting in their argument
They keep splashing the water, even splashing your daughter
The whiplash caught her, balloons cash cough-up
When you watch the woman balance on a tight rope
Your adrenaline pumps and gives you a tight throat
Cantaloupe antelope antidote, white goats
Clowns painting kids faces telling impolite jokes
As time blows over and the show's over
I'm riding home with giraffes in my Ra-Rover

[Outro: Left Brain]
Oh shit, OF, Odd Future
It's Mellowhype, yeah, pass the peanuts
