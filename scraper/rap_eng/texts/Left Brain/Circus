[Verse 1: Left Brain]
Just finished hitting these bitches and now I'm dipping
This barbecue sauce on my fried chicken
Am I tripping? I said that backwards
I rock my hat backwards, I'm on the beat, my swagger's dapper
Don't call me Dan, just cause I break down the weed
And wrap trees with my fam, don't mean I got wrapper hands
But I'd slap a fan quickly and I mean real quickly
Lube her up, do her up, that's what I call a quickie
Fucking faggot fan in the audience wanna diss me
I met his goofy ass back stage and I beat him pissy
His girlfriend was a witness, I said look Missy
Don't say a word and umm.. pass the ciggy
Or a stogie cause I got the greens
And I got the rollies and we can get high
And I can treat you like Kobe or Ghosty
Cause I'll fuckin' vanish if you wanna fuckin' panic, I'm the pussy bandit

[Hook]
We rollin' up the la-la-la, we rollin' up the la-la-la
Is he rollin' up a la-la-la? Nigga we rollin' up a la-la-la
Smokin' up the la-la-la, we gettin' high off the la-la-la
We so fly off the la-la-la, come and buy a la-la-la (Wolf Gang)

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
There's two girls, I'm in the middle in my black Continental
No it isn't a rental, so we gonna have to be gentle
She's arrested by my genitals like a fucking criminal
Felony after felony, well her priors are telling me
She wearing all spandex, like Sherman
I finna go nutty professor in her bloody old dress
Don't scream but hold them signs up, protest the W
NBA bouncing balls covering her breast up
Girl what's up with your friend on the left
I'mma have to go get, get it in on the left
Snip and trim on the left, slim skin on the left
She got a twin on the left, we were hiking up the canyon
I'm pulling out my canon, showing her a main companion
Cause soon eggs scrambling and then a nigga scramming
And you can't hold me back, Space jammin'
Two three's, weak balls, she eat balls, meatballs

[Hook]
