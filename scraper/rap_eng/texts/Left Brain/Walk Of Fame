I just want a star on the walk of fame
And all the bad bitches will know my name
I just want a star on the walk of fame
And all the bad bad bitches know my name
Hundred million dollars and gold chains
I just want a star on the walk of fame
And all the bad bad bitches know my name
I just want a star on the walk of fame

[Khawait Khastellano]
Hollywood and highland right on the corner bitch
Kardashian you already know I'm rich
Yall niggas so reverbnation
I deleted my account and started fucking hating
Is you serious?  Im hatin' on Khawait
Shit on his last years spittin' in his face
If I seem him in the booth nigga murder with a case
For real nigga, yeah lets make a half a million
Quad dribble it and chase bitches that speak Brazilian
Gold Cuban chain nigga that's how I'm feelin'  uahhhh
Like Mike Tyson at 19 heavy weight champ in a minute
Hit these bitches hard as shit though
Bad bitch waitin' butt naked in Frisco
And she love me like the verge in a jesus crystal
Whaaaaat

[Rockey Washington]
Don't all those bad bitches know my name
Light it up I'm Michael Jackson on that walk of fame
Off that couple of grams then roll a couple roaches up
Glamours only go for us amateurs hardly know of us
Dog I'm super turned on so exclusively turnt up
I don't know where I went wrong
All those haters just gave up most of em shut the fuck up
We some where gettin' these bucks up gettin' them bucks up
Dollars stadiums Harlem
We pissing off all those bloggers and pissin' on all those rappers
Blowin' nothin' but jet fuel flying with Elroy Jetson
The future is lookin' funny like pimps screaming for money
Off Hollywood and Vine standing on Mickey Rooney
My nigga we on some new shit on some how did they do this
Magical shit is wicked ain't as illest as my clique
It's Christmas my niggas gifted
Niggas Ebenezer breathin' in the game blowin' out hella reefer
