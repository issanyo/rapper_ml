[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Beats breaking necks, flows sick like heart attacks
Ya'll faggots can't compare, bitch you lying when you make up facts
I'm fuckin' real, hustle like a gangster
So shut your fuckin' mouth before you have to fuckin' answer
To me bitch, have your legs broke bitch
Leave your cleaned ass carcass in a muddy fuckin' ditch
I'm a fucking beast and on your body we will feast
So get the fuck up out my face unless you want your life ceased

[Refrain] X4
NAC, we fuckin' roll like serial killers
Shoot dope, smoke weed, and fuck your whole village

[Verse 2]
We murder and pillage
You ain't safe in your village
Rape any civilian with the mental or physical
Everything I do is critical
Bitch you ain't no criminal, contributions minimal
I kick shit subliminal
When you get it, it's too late
Meet your fate, no escape
From the debate, of heaven or hell
Can't you tell that your body will soon be an empty shell
A puddle of blood and bone that make up your spiritual home
Rhymes hit you like chrome straight to the dome
Exit wound and gray matter, turning dark with blood splatter
I creep when I fuckin' need to
Because I don't care to be seen
Me an NAC? A fucking murderous team
Bitch

[Outro]
