said I'm deeper than the underground, we move in silence with out a sound, I'm in the back of the car and all the homies got burners we're singing "Lord Don't Fail Me Now!"
People I grew up with trynna hold me back,
and belittle my accomplishments,
go ahead and drag my name right through the mud,
act like I got where I'm at because of luck
hook:
"Lord Don't Fail Me Now!""Lord Don't Fail Me Now!"
I'm in the back of the car and all the homies got burners we're singing "Lord Don't Fail Me Now!" x2

verse 2 (left brain)
Lord don't fail me now, I'm in this caravan trynna dodge a felon na,
babies in the trunk I'm feelin like a pedophile,
100 miles no sleep aint no tellin how, no body tellin over here nobody yellin out
my n*gga sellin over here and we gon' sell it out, and if you tellin' over here I'll punch you in yo mouth, east side west side up north south, OG left brain mind gone wolf gang gang gang from the land of the gang bang, takin pictures on a 747 plane on my way to spain, staying out of reach, feet up on the beach, connect in any streets, practice what you preach, staying out of reach, lord don't fail me now FUCK THE POLICE.

verse 3 (ash)
I live the life that most would die for,
I'm not braggin I'm just happy cause I died for it,
I chased my dreams untill the main stage,
I rode the bench and then absorbed game,
they say uh,
hard times lead to great art, what the fuck you do when everything it falls apart, now I watch the sunset every morning from the stu, now I see the blueprints of my path my elders drew.
long race had a slow start, feel the need of this inside my beating heart, risking everything I've got to gain it all, not I know just how to pick my self up when I fall
hook:
"Lord Don't Fail Me Now!""Lord Don't Fail Me Now!"
I'm in the back of the car and all the homies got burners we're singing "Lord Don't Fail Me Now!" x2
