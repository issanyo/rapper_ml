[Chorus: Left Brain]
Imma tell you like the homie told me
Don’t get trapped when you fuckin’ with these streets
‘Cause it’s a rat race and it’s all for the cheese
Don’t get caught fuckin’ slippin’
Imma tell you like the homie told me
Don’t get trapped when you fuckin’ with these streets
‘Cause it’s a rat race and it’s all for the cheese
Don’t get caught fuckin’ slippin’

[Verse 1: Left Brain]
Swerve to the left, I swerve to the right
To infinity, my swag buzz light
Fuck a Bud Light, Henney got my buzz rights
We ten deep bitch, it’s a thriller life
All up in the session with the bottles in this box
Young trill nigga, from the the murda block
West coast shit, don’t be slippin’ after dark
Stomp yo ass up, leave ya full of dirt marks
We might be ridin’ in that ‘lac, I might be solo on that back
Imma pull up to my show, we about to get right
We about to get right
We about to take flights
We about to get right
We about to head right, right (right)

[Chorus: Left Brain]
Imma tell you like the homie told me
Don’t get trapped when you fuckin’ with these streets
‘Cause it’s a rat race and it’s all for the cheese
Don’t get caught fuckin’ slippin’
Imma tell you like the homie told me
Don’t get trapped when you fuckin’ with these streets
‘Cause it’s a rat race and it’s all for the cheese
Don’t get caught fuckin’ slippin’

[Verse 2: Go Dreamer]
‘Cause niggas out here hella petty, so ridiculous
And bitches take you for your money, so conspicuous
But I ain’t talking ‘bout no rappin’
So you can miss me with that bullshit (daaamn)
I’m trying to see a billion
I’m trying to get it high as a ceiling, don’t see no limit
I’m trying to stack up on veggies, go on and eat ya spinach
I gotta go out and get it, fuck up the competition
Yeah I’m on a mission, your [?] scripture

[Chorus: Left Brain]
Imma tell you like the homie told me
Don’t get trapped when you fuckin’ with these streets
‘Cause it’s a rat race and it’s all for the cheese
Don’t get caught fuckin’ slippin’
Imma tell you like the homie told me
Don’t get trapped when you fuckin’ with these streets
‘Cause it’s a rat race and it’s all for the cheese
Don’t get caught fuckin’ slippin’
