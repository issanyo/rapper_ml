[Verse]
I don't know how to start, but I sounded so serious
I wish my name is George so I can be Curious
When beats goes Fast, I ended something Furious
2015 lost two friends I trust period
Niggas and bitches thought themselves so hideous
Guess that's why their chased, acting so mysterious
Lately been alright, I need a librarian
He has 10,000 shelfs, that's really laborious
I'm still B.I.G., two times my Notorious
Wish one day can see the sky so glorious
Isn't the limit yo, the lie inglorious
I can't afford me shit, bitches afford their dicks
Since I'm still feeling stress, feel like don't want to live
Lancaster's my Hill, where's my bong so I can hit
Wonder Lord created Cypress, wonder what if
What if all I see is a lie, started a stiff
What if the Devil's playing tricks, God's just helping
What if inside of me, right heart is yelping
What if my name isn't Zaramo, meant to be Skelpy
What if I'm not blessed, God would've tell me
What if I commit suicide, wonder how hell be
What if
