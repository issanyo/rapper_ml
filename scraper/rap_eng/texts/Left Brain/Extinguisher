[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I’m attacking your captain, Battle raps
Shitting, clogging and calling your plumber
How these old ass niggas newcomers?
I’m coming sunny, mid-summer
Nose runny,  gunning like hunters
While tune and jazz gunthers
Fuckboys listening to gangsta records
Now they flex  like Bedford
Knowing that I take they wives,  Stepford
I’m all about the extras, nigga read all about it
Extra tits, excessive spliffs, clouded, surrounded never grounded
Higher than my curb palace
Wondering lands of lakes with alice
My point is valid when my character is challenged
Looking malice in the face like "bitch you owe me a favor"
Turn my head to karma, fuck it I’ll deal with you later
I’m the exterminator, my eyes low and red like the terminator
Arnold Schwarzenegger perpetrator
Pepper spraying the furthest hater
Nigga my service awaits ya
Wake up and smell the percolator
I’m smoking and blowing gators

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Fuck the whole world, I fuck a niggas bitch
I fuck the rap game with my fist til’ I get sick of this
Spittin’ sick, ripping through visions of written syphilis
He slit his wrist to ink all these verses, blood in my penmanship
Hit or miss, bitch I’m batting like I’m on PED’s
Niggas want to switch they words like baby boy on BET
Young niggas still cruising we’re moving like he’s Eazy- E
Easy spitting ether watchem’ freak and leak like Petey-P
Fuck everybody, no love for human ecology
I bomb like I’m Islamic for all the shit you ain't promise me
Fuck is competition? Nobody poppin’ as hot as me
I’m running shit, several miles ahead and still ain’t stopped to breathe
I don’t need no help, my bitches tell me by myself
Fuck with my niggas from OF, don’t feel nobody else
Still perfecting my rhymes, you niggas chilling on the shelf
Watching my steps, you like my kid I’ll hit you with a belt

[Hook: Hodgy Beats and Domo Genesis]
I got it covered
I’m on top of that (on top of that)
They pop and live I’m stopping that
Fuck ya’ little raps nigga Hip hop is back
Popping straps, stocking caps
Buy some crack
Can’t forget we smoking weed (Bitch a lot of that)
Remember that you’re fucking with the wolf gang
The louder pack
Remember that my niggas gotta eat
We browse your house in fact
In fact we’ll take your spouse and nap with her
Then we’ll bounce her back, nigga

[Verse 3: Domo Genesis]
Crazy, I'm crashing shit as fast as
Whatever won't crash under pressure
I'm blasting til I grab my endeavors
I'm trashing whoever, no obstacle could stop this view on top of you
I lost a screw, my thoughts are loose
I cop the coupe, forgot the roof
I got the flu: think you sick? I'll spit a pot of soup
I'm stopping through to give em instructions on what they're not to do
Nigga's think they're into something, really they ain't got a clue
Racing for my space, gotta slow 'em down like a chop and screw
I'm powering prose, slightly powered his nose
Doped out of control, aura overpower you hoes
How the fuck they still sleeping?
Wake em up to a double barrel
Fuck beef, bitch we biting through the fucking bone marrow
Pedal to the floor, I accelerate through nonsense
Imma snap and I'mma keep it like a quarterback with options
I'm so faded off the sweet, one more please I'll be unconscious
Shit, I'm dropping, got me poppin
All Star, Western Conference

[Verse 4: Hodgy Beats]
Bitch, I be hitting the pocket, pockets so deep in my pants
Rock it obese, take a glance swat and flee gon' flee where I stand
You ain't poppin that, I'm poppin with pumpkin seeds in his hand
Jack-O-Lantern, back for Santa his reindeer breaking antlers
Fuck asking questions, I'm taking answers and women on dates with Prancer
By night you turn rapper to dancer washed up sitting in the hamper
Mildew-filled flows damper like grandmama pampers
Took a piss, that's on her fishnets, smell like dry fish and sweats
Look at this guy, man hits nets, get high above [?]
Fucking chin-check insects from your shin to your biceps
Money hungry till I'm comfy stuffing duffles with mushroom truffles
I hate life, cause I love the troubles, karma comes in doubles
And I check, stuff the couple all I know is struggle, all I see is rubble
Jumpstart on the ground to the sky like a fucking shuttle
My country looks like a puzzle. Time's the limit, get your hustle

[Hook]
