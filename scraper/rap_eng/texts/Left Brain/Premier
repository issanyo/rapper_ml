[Verse 1]

First impression, judge like I'm judge judy
Pretty face, big lips, stagnant booty
She make me wanna Doobie Doo like Scooby
Canary in her treasure chest, move inside the rubies
I need the Yellow, Hype, Mellow
Shirley, Temple, girl he ain't ghetto
Drive automatic and shifts on the stick
Drive a nice ride and, rides a nice dick
Crystal Louboutin, red bottom, black bow
Had two sleeves, let her tattoo show
There's no limit to her, she's irrational
Peep my crunch cause I be cappin hoes
I'm the captain, hoes overlap big foes
My game is in her world, call it caption closed
Cause I would never leave her, after I came
She fixing up her weave before she give me some brain

[Hook]
This is her premier - and she walking down the runway
Model coke bottle, I gotta have her one day
This is her premier - and I'm watching from the sidelines
I gotta have her so I'm following the guidelines
This is her premier - and she walking down the runway
Model coke bottle, I gonna have her one day
This is her premier - and I'm watching from the sidelines
I gotta have her so I'm following the guidelines

[Verse 2]
She's a feminist no she's feminine
I take the rainbow, she eat my M&M's
We're better lovers than we are fucking friends
In magazine holding hands, we're a loving trend
And girl I won't stop until the loving ends
And I won't turn on you unless your loving bends
You hang with guys but I ain't tripping on your friends
Cause I opened up your eyes and took off the covered lends
Uhh, now you see what's real
And when you touch you can see what you feel
And when we meet I don't sting like an eel
But I make your ass clap like a seal
Tossing and turning in the king size
Make you wanna take a bite out of this King Size
When I say open up, girl I mean wide
I got a sweet tooth - you want a cream pie?
(Ha ha ha)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You've got swagger, damn you've got swagger
I try your fruit out, then I want to bag ya
But first baby girl I've got a purchase
Let me try out to see if you're worth it

[Repeat verse slowed down]
