[Verse 1]
I just fucking woke up outta cold sweat
Cold ass nigga, choosing up on your ho next
Fresh without a Rolex, I'mma need a bow-flex, sex without a protects
Shout out to my baby boy
Bitch I'm making crazy noise
Smoking while I'm leaning in a La-Z boy
Nag Champas was burning like dope
I point a lot and if i don't poke i'm cumming in her throat
Pearlescent friend [?], cause a player eyes, i scope til I win my vote
If I don't answer praising phone calls for year, leave a note, all she wrote
One for [?] to the pigs, nigga i'm the GOAT
I'mma give and go, you niggas giving up hope
First you reach a simple goal then keep it pushin 'til it bloats
Be about your business, make em come and get it, quote
Getting money by the [?] like hundred oats?
It's rare to see me out, the studio is where I pose
Pretty faces bring the mils and tell they friends like a joke
She just wanna kick it on the kayak and smoke
Are you high yet? Cloud 9 for the most
Even though I don't drink, I play the flute before I toast
To this OF shit networking when I gross
I need a closet nympho with my bed because I'm gross
I'm dope, you can come and get a dose, I'm coast to coast
I'm higher, adios, my chromosomes are comatosed
I gotta get bread, make sure it come with toast
Smoking rose bowls as I'm waving on the floor
Fuck a New Year, be about growth (nigga)

[Bridge]
I just fucking woke up outta cold sweat
Fuck with me, my niggas running yo set, running yo set
Take what you owe, your stash, ya dough
And call it collect, don't star 69 my line
Unless you wanna homicide and resurrect

[Hook x2]
It ain't the same since we came in the game
Blamed for the change, ain't bring a thing
Hit the range, flamethrowin, chain swangers
It's my name on tha thing, hang with the gang wangers
The gang wangers, the gang

[Verse 2] (Needs Corrections)
I'm exposed like film ask Sammy's camera
Foreign countries band then abandon us
Donuts on the rag put your fucking bandanas up
Niggas shining up like we selling grams for bucks
Amateur staircase flow
Nigga pick your pencil up, chilling in the cut don't give a fuck
If itâ€™s Mr. Marl blowing down the steps, a blunt
Hotter than the engine when you rev it up
My foot is on the gas no letting up
Rap is the game packing up
And great family and better trust
No hand-me-down's while Im getting up
I rather get up on my own than ride the camera's bus
Prefer to show up late and have them ?
OF, Mellowhype, LB, HB, ?, Yellowhite, living ghetto life
Beach cruise, shoes laced so I pedal right
I got a lot to celebrate on this special night
Drive my own whip, used to catch the bert? Ernie
Now I'm macking women like Bernie
You got a problem? probably don't concern me
Cuz I'm yearning for this blunt to be burning in the adjourning for my attorneys cause I'm learning
More on this earth
I'll exploit this whore 'til I get her for what she's worth
I'm your fucking motivation been this way since birth
And I'mma go to hell before I go to church
I ain't scared nigga
Cash cow, I'm rare nigga
My flow flight like stairs I dare a nigga to stare, nigga
Playing rap musical chairs with all these square niggas
Catch a fade for my spot, they fighting fair with you
Life is a bitch, so she playing with my hair, nigga
Saying 'Truth or Dare', smoking weed like a care-giver
Tell that ho to share with the motherfucking flog gnaw
A nigga be so high you gotta call off?

[Bridge]
