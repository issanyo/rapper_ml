[Intro]
Yeah
I'm gonna be free like a bird
(Like a bird)
Gonna be free
I'm gonna be free like an eagle
(Like an eagle)

[Chorus: Left Brain]
Might pull up in the same clothes
Real nigga shit, fuck the fame ho
And I got a bankroll (Cash)
That's how the game go
Game go, game go
Real nigga shit, that's how the game go
Game go, game go
Real nigga shit, that's how the game go

[Verse: Jay Worthy]
Yeah bitch that's how the game go
Change your life when I took off the [?]
Work the pole lil mama, let's get real low
Break bread so we could [?] like a field goal
Hit my nigga Giovanni, that's payroll
Big bossing on you bitches, blow a bankroll
Just copped [?]
[?] backstreets tryna stay low
No [?] in this bitch, fuck the po-po
In my nigga's Maserati, that's toe-toe
I hit my nigga [?], that's bro-bro
I'm in the [?], get it brackin' like oh no
Twenty deep in the club, never solo
[?] Gang baby, all my niggas yelling [?]
[?] back to the [?]
Real niggas stay in this bitch, that's how the game go

[Chorus: Left Brain]
Might pull up in the same clothes
Real nigga shit, fuck the fame ho
And I got a bankroll (Cash)
That's how the game go
Game go, game go
Real nigga shit, that's how the game go
Game go, game go
Real nigga shit, that's how the game go

[Verse 2: Da$h]

[Chorus: Left Brain]
Might pull up in the same clothes
Real nigga shit, fuck the fame ho
And I got a bankroll (Cash)
That's how the game go
Game go, game go
Real nigga shit, that's how the game go
Game go, game go
Real nigga shit, that's how the game go
Game go, game go
Real nigga shit, that's how the game go
Game go, game go
Real nigga shit, that's how the game go
