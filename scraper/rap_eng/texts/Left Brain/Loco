[Intro]
Good fuckin' morning, nigga
Wake the fuck up, it's four o'clock man, come on

[Verse 1]
Pigs raid my crib, I'm feeling like Fred Hampton
I got firearms under my mattress, camping
Yo, I'm from the ghetto where there's special enhancements
Niggas begin to shoot and don't get second chances
Banana clips conceal weaps, hit 'em 'til they feel sweat
Beat these predator United States, bitch I'm a real threat
Besides the drug movement, move with all associate Socialists
And we hangin' by the rope and shit, we give each other hope like gifts
Though I'm a nigga with an attitude
Drinking, aiming at your dude, scary, huh? Your bladder full
Hinderant doctor, with a militant posture
Bearing arms like an octo, smoke killa weed, killa Rasta
At the lamppost in Oakland next to Bob Seale
My heart don't beat, fuck the heart throb feel
I said, I said, my heart don't beat, fuck the heart throb feel

[Intrelude]
It's not just you
I hate everybody, goddamn

[Verse 2]
Man I tell 'em boys catch up, catch up, ketchup, ketchup
Odd Future Wolf Gun Gang put them tecs up
One shot, one kill, Tyrane never mess up
Take more than a fuckin' lie detector to fess up
Mustard, mustard, mustard, mayo
Odd Future Grand Gang music and the yayo
Anthrax packaged to the door in potato
Call me hammerhead cause I mash him like he Play-Doh
I'm a rat nigga, where the cheese at?
I'm goin' after stacks, nigga, where them G's at?
Matter fact, honey, where dem B's at?
And all them niggas with them A-B-C hats
I'mma take y'all back to school, you fuckin' dropout
Who work a fuckin' 9 to 5 just to cop out
I'm on the block nigga, not when the cops out
Keys open doors and you the mothafucka locked out

[Outro]
Bitch, Wolf Gang, MellowHype, BlackenedWhite
Killing y'all niggasâ€”don't fuck with Odd Future, bitch
