[Intro: Supa Hot Fire Sample & Left Brain]
I broke up with my ex-girl
Riding new shit, rims spinning
I broke up with my ex-girl
Riding new shit, rims spinning like a fidget

[Chorus: Left Brain]
Riding new shit, rims spinning like a fidget
New chains on, real cold super fridgid
Stupid ass bitch only gave her six digits
You want my phone number, well here's the wrong number (Sike!)
Riding new shit, rims spinning like a fidget
New chains on, real cold super fridgid
Stupid ass bitch only gave her six digits
You want my phone number, well here's the wrong number

[Verse 1: Left Brain]
You like some broke headphones, only one side work
Right side, left side, she make both sides twerk
[?] Left Brain, bitch you know my worth
I got money in the bank, bitch you know I'm a flirt
And I just broke up with my ex so I'm going berzerk
And I just copped the brand new Lex, you know I'm gon' skrrt
Yellow bone in the passenger seat, she wearing a skirt
She suck my dick on the freeway made me crash in the dirt
Cause I got big belts on me like Texas
All my niggas with me and they're wreckless
Everything checked off of my checklist
And I got all my side bitches on the guest list

[Interlude: Supa Hot Fire]
I broke up with my ex-girl
I broke up with my ex-girl
Here's her number
Sike, that's the wrong number

[Chorus: Left Brain]
Riding new shit, rims spinning like a fidget
New chains on, real cold super fridgid
Stupid ass bitch only gave her six digits
You want my phone number, well here's the wrong number (Sike!)

[Verse 2: Go Dreamer]
Look you didn't want me and I didn't want you
You say that I cheated, girl that is not true
You say the lying, I saw you at Whole Foods
You think that you sick huh, you think that you're so cool
See I'm over it, over it, over it, please get over it
See I was so selfish, I didn't mean to hurt the bitch
I would [?] I didn't mean to [?]
See I was just drifting, I didn't mean to swerve the bitch
New whip, new phone, who dis
Big [?], big steak, big chips
Big bag, big [?], big dick
Big weight, big chain, big shit
Let's go

[Chorus: Left Brain]
Riding new shit, rims spinning like a fidget
New chains on, real cold super fridgid
Stupid ass bitch only gave her six digits
You want my phone number, well here's the wrong number (Sike!)
