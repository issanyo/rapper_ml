[Verse 1]
Bitch I got my rights and I got two guns
And a pocket knife, yeah I cocked it twice
You have dropped it, ice
Stopped the rice, ox eat rice, vegetables
I can't kill 'em all but this semis able
Cannibal eat a nigga off of any table
Brain poured your labels 'til my pour is faithful
No average payroll niger work your kingdom
Money by the minute, money by the hour
Drugs in the bathtub, money in the shower
Check it early riser, OF bang louder
Arouse ya, bitch when I begin to crowd around her
Then think to my thesis, caught up in a prefix
Music is premixed, the remix, with guns sounds
And gun rounds and brief kicks
Call it the remix of the bible, influenced by Jesus

[Hook]
I'm coming to kill 'em all, gunnin to kill 'em all
Hollows they feel 'em all, bananas I peel 'em all
Pussy dont get involved, ligaments will dissolve
Problems I will resolve, niggas I will revolve
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all

[Verse 2]
I keep work like observers who watch workers working, serve them
Listen to every word and try their best no to be a burden
I met her she was a virgin, until I cut her like a neuro brand surgeon
Hip hop riding, I'm swerving, take her to rodeo but she can't find mervyns
We high priced sailing, high like scaling
We on fire, you trailing if I'm fresh, you stale then
Put me on figures as I peddle with my my niggas
Notice my fan base getting a tad bigger
We start shit and burn the swisher
Iron the creases, im a t while them other bitch twist up
The common collective, my rhymes are perfected
I'll come up for the throne, not your diamond or necklace

[Hook]
