[Verse 1: Matt Martians]
And in the last day of his life
He realized that
Everything that he had ever worked for up to that point
Didn't mean a thing
And that
The way he made people feel would be
The only thing that people would remember
Off to the 5th Echelon

(Laughter)

[Verse 2: Hal Williams]
I cook the cheese
It is the cheese
I love the cheese
Ah the cheese
Put the mix in the pot
Then drop in the noodles
A dash of the salt
Ah the cheese
Its smell is so good
You want a taste?
You cannot have a taste
Cause it is my cheese
It is not your cheese
It is my cheese
It is not your cheese
Ah ha look at me
I enjoy the cheese
