[Intro]
Mike G
Left Brain

[Hook: Left Brain] x2
Riding with my niggas
Got them fingers on them triggers
And we shootin' at the piggas
Cause you know we don't give a
Damn
Nigga know we don't give a
Damn
Nigga know we dont give a
Damn

[Verse 1: Mike G]
Daytime matters not
We still throw back shots
And we cause road blocks
Turn streets into parking lots
My income now comes in like volleys in tennis
And I own this, in a sense every person's a tenant
In a week I can come up to a Porsche from a Honda
Feds be lurking dip through Hollywood, dont turn on Santa Monica
Stack commas, you get richer
Zeros on Mondays
And bring dounuts for the bitches
Everything with best intentions
Figure them out
Now my women run to give me hugs
They love drinking drugs
They no loser in his game
Is the first to fall in love
I won't lie
It was easy to get you
Now since im with you
Friends wanna join the club
If it every jumps off
They we will get ill
With the smoke kills
Got you throat oh so chill
We turn it up
Till this loud like heavy metal
Loud like punk rock
Got issues in this loiter squad
Lurking in your parking lot

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Mike G]
I cruise through with a skateboarder’s frame
I reign so long I could douse spitfire’s flames
So lifted
With my weapon to the ground I aim
And if I fire off rounds I can shoot down planes
I'm a walking masterpiece
An audible art of war
Life's not a movie
Our tours are blockbusters like Jaws
I'm a universal legend
We switch lives for a day
Broke niggas be in heaven
Judgmental then you need lessons
You should be second guessing
Your wardrobe selection
Your doors are closed like criminals
With excessive arrest
See you rocking with the best
I can do this forever nigga
I'm up for whatever
Down for murder anytime
Temperature, any weather
My aim is to get better
And you listen to my lectures
Like college professors
Stack green
I got flow
You can't store in canteens
I'm the man
I'm the sun
I'm a lion
I'm a king
I'm

[Hook x2]
