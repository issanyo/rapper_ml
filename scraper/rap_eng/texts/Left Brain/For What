{Chorus - Warhol.SS}
B.B. simon belt blingin
Keep the nine tucked in this Givenchy
Damn u talk too much, I wantchu to top me
Baby don’t be shy I want it sloppy
Picture perfect nigga, I got drip on me now
Hunnid round choppa shootin, buss him in his eye
Keep the fye nigga, don’t u test it cuz it’s tucked
Wesson make him buckle, I could give a fuck
Fuck his ho for what
Keep this pole for what
Hit the store for what
Hoppin out this truck
Niggas want woods, finna roll up
Choppa on the passenger, I might jus cut the stove up

{Verse - Warhol.SS}
Choppa rob a nigga, we gon stop him like a hold up
I’m in traffic ridin round wit Peso we be poured up
Deuce or better in this Fanta, nigga don’t u bother me
Rollin this gelato, u know we gon need all the tree

{Verse - Drugrixh Peso}
Big chain on my neck bling
(Bling Bling Bling)
Rich gang getcha bitch weak
I dropped 8 lines and lost faith
(Lost faith)
Real trap nigga my racks never shrink
Check my insta I got drip on me now
(Drip now)
I’m in the pot, Saint Laurent, neck down
Givenchy on dat ho I bet I pipe her down
(Bet I hit)
I lift my wrist up on two cups right now
I hit my DMs, yo bitch in it now
It’s 12pm, on two of em now
Fuck the Motorsport I have to toast up wit my niggas
It’s fear god but I know god gon forgive a killer
I bussdown Rollie’s and count up for my potential
It’s detrimental, get some money, they don’t feel you (they don’t understand)
I want my nigga Warhol play wit dem my kids
(Play wit our kids)
I pour more codeine so ion gotta feel it
Shoot a 12, kill yo ass in a whistle
It ain’t no talkin to zip the bag n I don’t miss
If that’s my nigga then I pour that Actavis
Upgrade my income, I dropped it in the trenches (in the trenches)
