[verse 1]
I'm alone and I'm throwing stones
And sticks at a nigga home
Trying to get a bitch in a nigga throne
When all them old sayings saying get a niggas own
Follow the motto till a young hit the lotto
Hit the jackpot like a kid to gelato
Stuntin' in the lobby pilazo
What happens stays in vegas never spill it the mazel
Spitting hot shit man it burning my tonsils
Fucking bitches in a foreign hotel
Hostel bout to go to a brothel
Where you wanna go fells like they can't stop you
How thoughtful, karma comes back when you step to the crossroads
Your whole life you were searching for your lost souls
Zombies roam earth inside of em' is hollow
A whirlwind of deep and shallow cold like the pole of gallow
Surrounded by a common nation of all kind of hatred
I don't have the time of day for you to keep me up to date with
Hay bitch we ain't nothing to play with don't say shit we're number 1 he's basic
Beheaded the poodle the moon on my spaceship
[?] to a playlist
Grateful to sell fate in its greatness
No pressure I'm weightless

[verse 2]
Burning bubble gum and girl scout cookies
I sit inside and let the highland thin and bush me
K.O.P kush over pussy I'm short don't overlook me
Snakes and traps in the grass I had to cut the bushes plus the bullshit
I'm Hodgy beats lil bitch I do it to the fullest
Catch me at ninety-nine percent and I'm gon' have to bite the bullet
You calling truces my will is bruces
I'm a son of a music fluently reclusive
The booth is where that noose is and blue prints
Draw out my future no fugitive
Smoking to a tillest food I get gotta stack money cause frugal be the mood I'm in
Surrounded by my pride searching for a piece of mind hurting
Knowing it's gonna be fine working
Til my hearing declines
Knowing what I deserve in this time
I swear that every word in my rhymes nigga

[verse 3]
In this world there's trauma so Ima plan it loosely  force myself to retreat
No plans with groupies all these bitches wanna suck on this cold organic smoothie
At times I give a fuck for her orgasmic movies
She calls my phone like I am alone when I ain't alone shall I pick up or silence the tone
To her I am the tones is violent never really quite at her home shes crying
Knowing she'ed be better on her own
Inside its like mine co climate that's why she stuck to my side like Siamese
Got [?] world is offered Obama is rhyming
Two time is for niggas trying to time it I hate to serve salami, pastrami
Sometimes you have to see shows out of [?] in spite of me I'm tactful
Niggas pressing charges so I kick back play bashful
Knowing I would bash skulls if I had to
Imma stay in my habitat have your attitude away before this altitude
