Catchin' plays, fifty stacks
Double down, hundred racks
Put the rest up in the stack

Catchin' plays, fifty stacks
Double down, hundred racks
Put the rest up in the stack
[?]
Run it back, we run it back
(Run it back, yeah_
Run it back
We run it back, we run it back
Run it back, hundred stacks

[Verse 1: L-Dogg]
Got the gas in the tank and got the gas in the black (Smoke up)
Shorty got an ass and I can see it from the front (Damn)
Charge it to the game, my nigga I don't give a fuck (No)
[?] stripes in the streets, it's like a tiger in the trunk
But I'm something like a lion
King of all this shit, you disagree you get to fryin'
Like some ribs at a black family cookout (We eatin' good)
I'm running it back, my lil homie on the lookout (Okay)
Bird call when it's hot (Bllll)
If that's the case then bust and Left post up on the block
You finna hit the yee-yee, [?] straight (Okay)
And we gon' count this bread, smoke up
And leave busting at the plate
We don't stop, nigga

[Verse 2: Left Brain]
I'ma run that shit back like I'm Jim Brown
My lil nigga workin' with ten pounds
And he ain't thinkin' bout no retirement
Watch that lil bitch hit the heisman
I just hit my plug, he got deposit
I might just pull off to the bakery
Real nigga shit, ain't no faking me
I be chilling where the Lakers be
Court side flexing on the Laker girls
Tryna make that motherfuckin' money twirl
Money make the world go 'round, I'ma make it keep on spinning
Riding in the Uber with the tenant
All my niggas [?]
Charlie Sheen, like Charlie Sheen
[?] when I'm off that lean
That money [?]
[?] I'm a fiend about that green
Bitch I'm a fiend, know what I mean
Know what I mean, I gotta
