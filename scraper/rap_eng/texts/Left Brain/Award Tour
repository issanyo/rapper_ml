[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
I constantly get the feelin' that Satan watchin' me
Nice stroll on a quest for a soul, probably
But luckily I gave him mines a long time ago
Fuck you expect when child's momma and father gone
But truthfully I ain't got no life, a lifeline my brain's dead
Strobe lights gleam as I dance with the devil
Ski mask and a shovel, the Grim Reaper, dig deeper
Into my mind tryna figure where I'm comin' from
Hell's basement, my bloodshed on gray pavement
Tryna meet death I guess, but shit I hate waitin'
Not only do I hate God but I hate Satan
Such a hater, I despise how I hate hatred
It's kinda dumb I see, but school was never fun for me
So I brought a gun with me, got tired of them fuckin' with me
So if Christ got a problem he can come and get me
And I got a sword for his side if he think he slick
To tell the truth I blame him for the mood switches
Guns for your gods and a noose for the cute bitches
I see you looking at me
Your smile is more disgusting than you wantin' to fuck
But still it makes me happy
Because what else I got?

[Bridge: Mike G]
Everything that you deserve
My logic to fill my pockets, build a billion off of words
The fame is secondary, because Washington was first
I came, saw, and conquered, gave you all that I was worth
Ugh, yeah
What more could you ask for?
They gave up on me, I wish you would have told me that before
I gave you everything, what more could you ask for?
Except for all the worlds gold, this is my Award Tour

[Hook: Vince Staples]
Because what else I got?
A nine millimeter, tech-nine loaded to the top
Got a couple plots in my head, I should give a shot
Hopefully they make me rich
Normality was never an option cause I hate the shit
I want the money, cars, clothes, and the girls
Still I get a sense that I don't belong in the world
So I fill a clip up and I point the shit straight at my dome
Fuck Heaven I just want to go home

[Verse 2: Mike G]
Time is only you waitin' for the past
Put your hand in and what you get out of it's what you grab
No lax, equals racks with no breaks or hiatus
Give dick to bitches, middle fingers to the haters
And now they get excited just to say that you seen us
Get paid and get maids just because the convenience
Because I got us up, but I'll never have enough
White sluts to fuck, she told me to bring cuffs
If lawyers get laid off, then we can't sue
But it's known he sell his soul for a GT-2
That's death, head-shots they infrared beams
It's why we roll with K's in the van just like the A-Team
Don't stop, go forth, proceed
Stay high, you can find me in the nose-bleeds
And they know we don't play for no prize
We make moves, you stay stiff like MRI's
You see? that's what you get

[Bridge 2: Mike G]
Everything that you deserve
My logic to fill my pockets, build a billion off of words
The fame is secondary, because Washington was first
I came, saw, and conquered, gave you all that I was worth
Ugh, yeah
What more could you ask for?
69, 187 on the girl next door
I want nothing, but everything, that's what I do it for
That and all the worlds gold, this is my Award Tour

[Hook 2: Vince Staples]
Because what else I got?
Besides a pocket full of nothing-ness
Scrapin' up a dollar for the bus that I just fuckin' missed
Don't wanna be the best, just put me in the discussion
Quit actin' like I'm not the best thing that you ever heard
I'm in it for the Awards for lack of better words
King size cupboard of whores Iâ€™m 'bout to put to work
Same ones from my childhood that I used to lurk
Now it's all good, because they see I'm fuckin' iced out
