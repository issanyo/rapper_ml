[Intro: Left Brain]

[Hook: Left Brain]
Am I gon' make a million dollars this year, we'll see
Should I finesse the plug today, we'll see
Me and my niggas gon' pull up with them choppers out, we'll see
Should I pull up in that foreign today, we'll see

[Verse 1: Left Brain]
Niggas be always askin' when the album come out, ayy we'll see
Bitches be always askin' if I'm comin' or not, ayy we'll see
Fuck boy keep on talkin' then a homicide it will be
All my real niggas, all my real bitches, yeah they feel me
That nigga LB so filthy but my boxers is silky
I just murdered the beat, I'm in the court pleading guilty (Fuck the police)
I'm a smooth criminal, she suckin' like tentacles
Ayy bruh I need ten of those, we bout to go digital

[Hook: Left Brain]

[Verse 2: L-Dog]
You will see a tragedy (so sad)
Y'all niggas don't listen, I told you get the fuck from round me
L-Dog I ain't playing, I'll have you niggas on channel 3
I'm cooking you niggas, runnin' in circles
[?] so weak
Fuck nigga freeze on ho shit, I ain't near it
If my mouth write a check then my hands gon' clear
Just tryna get the paper so the [?]
[?] and drive it off the lot, I ain't there yet
Cause I'm a fuckin' real nigga
Burrberry Larry Dog [?]
Sleeptalk on the beat, Left Brain first verse
