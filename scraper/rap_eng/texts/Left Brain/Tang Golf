[Intro]
Choose the sword and you will join me
Choose the ball and you join your mother in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
So, come boy, choose life or death

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
What the fuck is being humble about? I got the flows
And the shows and the hoes and the clout, so what you talkin' about?
Bathin' Ape by the bundle, no campin' out
With the camp put death to the trash y'all puttin' out
I remember wearin' them all red Vandals
Had them bitches ham when I jammed in a Tan Camry
Since I was 16 I had dreamed of them red Lambos
Success ain't open for me? I'm pickin' the damn handle
For an example, I'm as hot as a damn mantle
Fire when I spit, shit drip like lit candles
Bitches lying and crying, I hit cancel
Hard on my hoes, I'm only nice on this pencil
Handsome, dashing, with the calligraphy
And this is prolly an H now if it is a G
Free Earl I'm screamin' 'til we get to see
Odd Future motherfuckin' Wolf Gang history

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Eat a cock and cum mayonaisse ham sandwich
I do harm hammers relaxin' on a hammock
Flow damage, understood Mom's Spanish
I handle it, contain a rock Cal Cambridge
Ever since I got my crew, David and Clancy to manage it
And cuttin' through these tracks, Domo providin' the bandages
Wolf Haley torch the flamethrower
Mike G, bitches askin' him for money like he is the bank owner
Left Brain extract bitches mind and give 'em left brain
Soft synths, hard drums, give your bird chest pains
Ask Syd where we at, she tell you where we goin'
To free Earl from the fuckin' Samoans
If I was a pussy I would be Amanda Knox
Cause I'm homicide prone and I isn't gettin' caught
In a courtroom file ten council lawsuits
I'm fuckin' a judge so none of the laws fall through
