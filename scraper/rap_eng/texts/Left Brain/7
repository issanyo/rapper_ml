Nigga, it's MellowHype, what, you forgot?
Yeah, Left Brain on the beat

[Hook]
Got a bitch for everyday of the week
Not to mention the runner ups, told them no mentioning me
It go 7,6,5,4,3,2,1, 7,6,5,4,3,2,1
Monday through Sunday, someone new sleeping with me
Long as she keep going strong, make sure I sleep comfortably
It go 7,6,5,4,3,2,1, 7,6,5,4,3

[Verse 1]
She rolling marijuana and she let it all
It's only Wednesday, that's humpday, we finna' get it on
I like them white body woman, think she a little toned
Camera shoot, don't like cameras, mount it and film at home
So many people be calling ya boy, HB just stalling (Oh girl!)
Wake up after sleep to birds and tweet she still all on ya boy
Open my eyes to a pair of tits, bacon and some grits
Got my Thursday coming soon and oh she with the shit
No effort to get it wetter, she hit the split, she hit the splits
I walk around here free balling, play for the Knicks, she give me kiss
Gloss wearing off to the max, our lips, they stick together
Speaking tounge until it splits, until it splits
That weed, I twist like my nose rings, as she's rubbing my plugs
This Tempur-Pedic's the sweetest, she's white as a dove
Baby believe it, you're eager to be here, just say you're in love
Hate be the meat to the cleaver, Jesus sheâ€™s about to pull up, Friday

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You can't control a man, can't force him to hold ya hand
She get deep and then we snap like rubber bands, a hunnid bands
Parades of shades and underhands, the storm is now is thundering
You start stuttering, mumbling
Hurry up and buy, thanks, come again
You purchased enough time here, arguing with the cashier
Can't you see that there's a line here, selfish ass
You ain't the only fish in sea with ya' shell fish ass
And I'm selling 'em by the seashore
Where our resigns take a detour
You always mad at something, fuck you gotta be mad at me for?
All the things that I do, this shit just keep me prideful
Shit, now the world should be your rival
I'm the nigga standing right beside you
And everything is temporary, especially in February
Valentine and chocolate cherries, I'm copping 'em voluntarily
I keep my gang tight, rolling downhill, all news bearing
Pick her up and drop her off, but with them heels and gold earrings
I found this bitch, first she was lost
Look at her now, nigga I ain't sharing
