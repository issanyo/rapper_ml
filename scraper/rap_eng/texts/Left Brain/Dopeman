[Intro]
Tell me where the ticket, tell me where the ticket
Phone jumping out my back pocket
Tell me where the ticket is
Phone jumping out my back pocket
Tell me where the ticket is

[Verse 1: Reese]
Phone jumping, mean the trap jumpin too
Pull up on a nigga in a drop top
Young la' flare shorty yeah I do my thing
You ain't really tied in, you a half knot
Making cash transactions like I am Scott
[?] that paper on demand
I told him bring the racks on demand
[?] make a move, put it on demand

[Hook: L-Dog]
Call the dope man, nigga call the dopeman
Where the dopeman, I'm tryna cop some dro and
I need two o's man, call the fucking dopeman
Just call the dopeman, my nigga call the dope man

[Verse 2: Mike G]
If I cop a forty ounce I'ma do it for Proof
Shit got me so high I could walk on the roof
I know bitches that be all for self
Now, Seems like they just call for help
Got a black mask that I use for stealth
Dial straight down the center you should call for help
Defeating all contenders. All attention when I enter
Bass hitting got books falling off the shelf
No name in Miami when I'm switching four lanes
I'm an iceberg player baby it's a cold game
Baby tell me your name while I'm hopping off the plane
Beats got me feeling like black Cobain
Living life in a way they can't say the same
I can dance on the moon just to entertain ya
Mike G bitch say my name
Tryna have twenty girls swinging off my chain

[Hook: L-Dog]

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
1-800-Dopeman, nigga make the call
Molly, lean, xans, even got the adderall
My nigga Ducko in the kitchen and he water whippin' chickens
Greasy in the strip club throwing up [?]
Phone jumping off shit sound like a cricket
Nigga you could get the whole thing, we don't serve stickets
[?] touchdown, nigga know it's game over
We gon' play with that bat, you know we gon' flip it
Everybody wanna be a dopeman
And everybody don't be spitting dopeman
Thirty pounds of weed through the ocean
Crack sales right in the open
Everybody wanna be a dopeman
And everybody don't be spitting dopeman
Thirty pounds of weed through the ocean
Crack sales right in the open

[Hook: L-Dog]
