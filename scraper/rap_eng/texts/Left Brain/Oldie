[Verse: Mediumjay]
Survivors better swallow up their saliva
I'm stuffin em back in my Honda Elantra
Ran a red light, Crashed into a Nissan Altima
Flew off the largest bridge in Baltimore
Swam to the surface looked the doors on purpose
It took three weeks for the police to even notice
The blatant name calling that had tooken place
They ain't never seen a criminal with such good grace
By the time they got to the scene it was a waste
Cause I was already in Mexico gettin' hepatitis A
Spotted a little girl from Portugal
Tossed her in my 69 drop top Impala
Swervin' off the intersection I got hit by a bus
Did 6 full rotations then settled in a pile of dust
When I came to a complete stop, I got up and ran
Started waving my hands to the nearest vehicle to stop was a dodge mini-van
I drove off with the passenger, gun still to her head
Opened her door kicked her on the hood of an oncoming Javelin
Grabbed the child's safety seat with the baby still in
Barrel rolled doing 80, I got out with half my face scrapped
And I stole the victims of the hit and runs LaBaron Navy
The Driver? Unconscious from impact, I checked the glove box
40 keys intact, No chains attached
I grabbed that stash, Robbed a black for an Outback
Lost most the stash in the transaction only had 3 grams
While I was pondering the past, I didn't see the police radar I flew past
Ripped my GPS out the dashboard and threw it onto their windshield
I shot my last clip blindly and I threw the gun too
There was a police barricade that I just ran threw
Helicopters on my ass, I crashed into the bank
Kicked out the window and I hopped in the back
I was in the safe, Grabbed as much cake as I could take
S.W.A.T members busted in I threw cash in their face
He sprayed his partner and I picked up the 12 gauge
Swiftly I shot him in the head quickly
I'm wildin' with so much loot I'm not insured
For my own survival, I tossed 10 grand at a teen for his bicycle
And the rights to ride it out like sickle cell
Speeding down the back of the brothel
I ran into a fag and his boyfriend
My junk got fucked up, out of pure adrenaline
I snapped ones neck and I stole his wallet
Ran in the club and his friend wanted to fuck me up
I grabbed the taser of the security
Turned around and zapped him with 1000 volts of electricity
Reached in his pocket and I grabbed the keys
Ran to the parking lot and heard the beeping on a Mustang GT
Bright red I hopped in like Police/Please find me!
Looked up under the seat, 40 brand of 40
My formula 40, Drinking and driving I stopped at the airport
Got on the plane to Frankfort
Intoxicated I made my way up to the cockpit
I round house kicked the pilot
And threw the body in with the luggage
Flew the plane into the statue of liberty
Grabbed a parachute with 17
Seconds to spare, I watched the explosion in mid-air
I swam to the island for the survivors in the first bar
