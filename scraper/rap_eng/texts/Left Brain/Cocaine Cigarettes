[Intro: Nic Goose]
Yeah, Nic Goose
Raider Klan in this bitch
O.F. in this bitch, uh

[Hook: Nic Goose]
No spirits, just cocaine cigarettes
Living life everyday like I don't give a shit
But I truly do, that's why I moved to the loot
Conversations of money and secret avenue's

[Verse 1: Nic Goose]
The picture is clear, my vision is too
Nowadays I'm tryna' figure what the Benjamin's do
Long nights with empty stomach's
Lung's full of cannabis constructed my mental to stay savage
You faggot's got the game fucked up, lucked up, and got a shot at fame
I line 'em up and let it buck and shoot it at they brain
Maintaining ignorant, to the regular state of mind
My hustle game is like, stronger than '89
I'm cut from a different cloth
Me and my family moved drastically
Go over the border of California
I'm open to mass opinion, but then again
Who's line is it anyway?
Nasal congestion from all the sick shit I french kiss
Bitches be playing, I let them get thick, then bitch dip
Tryna' phase me with your neck work numbers
We came from the bottom, but I felt the best each summer
Bed sheets to a bummer
Ayo, shouts to the real niggas doing it
Down south, midwest, eastcoast they exclusive
I'm having visions of old Chevelle's, Dave Chappelle in the background
Listening to your rap style and it's whack, wow
Inspired by my mama's struggle
You a snake in the grass and I'm a lion in the jungle
All reach serenity, till infinity
Hard top, a car to drop top, J. Kennedy

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: 2.7.5. Sky Lex]
I'm out here focused, these niggas hopeless
Out here tryna' get they money but they eye's ain't open
Bitch come here, it's the year
And she wanna sip some beer, well here dear
God damn, I take the bitch to the bar
I take that bitch to the car, hit her in the car
El Camino, chino
Bitch you wanna roll with me, I can get you like dino

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
I'm next, rolling in the fly Lex'
With my ex and my nigga Sky Lex
On the sky pager, 275
Probably with the drop, hop out in fly gators
I'm the nigga with the answers written on my wrists
On my palms, I cheated on the final
Rough draft written on your spinal
Coming through like a pack of rhino's
Living large, like a dinosaur
Niggas looking for the knowledge, you can't find no more
I'll come through nigga, like the comodores
A nigga out here motherfucker, find a nigga
Come through, my niggas will do a drive by nigga
On a skateboard, niggas hate more, cause they can't
