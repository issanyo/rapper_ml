Yuh, yuh yuh, uh
Yeah, bitch
I just picked up two pints but I left 'em at the crib'o
Two pounds of that forty, when I'm sleep I need a pillow
And I'm itchin' on this Percocet I think I popped a triple
Just might lose it, I go stupid, fonem pop 'em like a pimple
Got a big bag on it, we went in this bonus
Crusin' in this Lotus, drank it help my focus
I came with that super skunk, smellin' like a odor
No this ain't no B.O., I tune up the motor

Jackie Chan kickin', I be rubber band poppin'
Drivin' crazy, lane switchin, 12 behind me I ain't stoppin'
I got two Glocks and they cockeyed, rock 'Balenci to the socks
Put her in Dior thats your own style I like my plantain with some ox
Gotta catch her, I just took the actress, put her on the block
Better not be actin', we'ont do the matchin', bitch I keep a knot
Okay, I prefer my soda money, Codeine killin' my kidneys ugly
Beatin' that bitch I'm doin' her slutty
Better not get that chalk all on me
