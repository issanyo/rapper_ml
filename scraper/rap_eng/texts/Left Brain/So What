[Intro: Left Brain]
My God, my God nigga, what’s good nigga?
God gang gon’ get it, get it? Go on nigga, got it?
Did you get it already? Alright nigga, what’s good?
Left Brain nigga, we in the studio right now nigga, no shit, nigga bye

[Chorus: Left Brain]
What? So fucked up (fucked up)
So what? (so what)
I done accidentally ashed in my own cup (damn)
But I’m still gon’ sip that drank bitch
So what? (so what)
Go get me another cup (lil’ bitch)
Me and my niggas gon’ what (let’s go)
What? So fucked up (fucked up)
So what? (so what)
I done accidentally ashed in my own cup (damn)
But I’m still gon’ sip that drank bitch
So what? (so what)
Go get me another cup (lil’bitch)
Me and my niggas gon’ what (let’s go)

[Verse 1: Left Brain]
Ballin’ on the west, lake shirt
Pass me the ball, Lonzo
Give it to me, hit ‘em with the pick n’ roll
I walk into the spot and I just pick a hoe
Yo, pocket full o’ BeneRoll
But I don’t never take these hoes to dinner though
I take her home and bend her like a centerfold
My bitch straight from a centerfold
Ooh yeah, playboy magazine
Playboy don’t get hit with the magazine
‘Cause we on the codeine and promethazine
I’m rolling down the street sippin’ on the [?]
Mah shit dope, ya nah mean?
Servin’ all the druggies like the ‘phetamine
Got two new young hoes on the team
And they let us get dick on the jellybean

[Chorus: Left Brain]
What? So fucked up (fucked up)
So what? (so what)
I done accidentally ashed in my own cup (damn)
But I’m still gon’ sip that drank bitch
So what? (so what)
Go get me another cup (lil’ bitch)
Me and my niggas gon’ what (let’s go)
What? So fucked up (fucked up)
So what? (so what)
I done accidentally ashed in my own cup (damn)
But I’m still gon’ sip that drank bitch
So what? (so what)
Go get me another cup (lil’ bitch)
Me and my niggas gon’ what (let’s go)

[Verse 2: Larry June]
Smokin’ and smokin’ and smokin’ and smokin’
The son of Rocka Choppa blown’ like horns
Infrared beam on all of my guns
Fuck the politics, my [?] cost a hundred
Woosa, yes lord, need that, ass fat
Titties small, goddamn (whoo-hee)
Keep suckin’, goddamn
(Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay)
Turn it up, shit yeah (ay-ay)
Ridin’ wit’ it (ay-ay-ay, ooh-ooh-ooooh)
Dopemanl, one-hand rap stands
Fuck the rap game, moving novocaine
We are not the same
Gettin’ back on the plane
He low 50K, goddamn

[Chorus: Left Brain]
What? So fucked up (fucked up)
So what? (so what)
I done accidentally ashed in my own cup (damn)
But I’m still gon’ sip that drank bitch
So what? (so what)
Go get me another cup (lil’ bitch)
Me and my niggas gon’ what (let’s go)
What? So fucked up (fucked up)
So what? (so what)
I done accidentally ashed in my own cup (damn)
But I’m still gon’ sip that drank bitch
So what? (so what)
Go get me another cup (lil’ bitch)
Me and my niggas gon’ what (let’s go)

[Outro]
(Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay)
