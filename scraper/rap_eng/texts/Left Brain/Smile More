[Intro]
Mellowhype, OF
Y'all should just hop on the bandwagon with us right

[Verse 1]
Don't eat in my car and I mean that
I'll open the door to the hood where you supposed to be at?
I know I'm tight nigga, I don't need your feed back
I'm so active, I cause others to deact
And when I hear "Run Forrest"
I run for it like my name Gump Forrest
I'm back like I hunch for it, hunch back
Keep me quickly then my handy dandy lunch sack
I gotta have my money, blunt wrap
I'm too hard to look down, so I just jump back
While I'm hanging in the cumulus equaling the numerous
Tired of being laughed at, well quit being humorous
It's a dog eat dog world and you knew the bitch
I hope you had rabies shots before you screwed the bitch
Feel my shit, like it's coming out my rectum
Already 2-stepping while you skipped over step one

[Hook]
I wanna show you the right way
So why don't you come and follow the Mellowhype way?
Come and follow the Mellowhype way
I wanna show you the right way

[Verse 2]
And if you on your grind, then I'm on my grind too
Nigga you wanna shine, well I wanna shine too
You about your time, well I'm times two
Rob you for your spot like you's a blind dude
I'm all about my hustle like Nipsey
If you ain't about that hustle nigga than you just ain't busy
That's why I got my camp behind me and your whole crew with me
Never be on the jump with my attitude pissy
I be on my skunk tip leaving verses shitty
Man I gotta eat eggs, toast, sinigrins please
I get served and homie you get swerved
26's on Suburbs when I pull up to the curb
Fight music, never had to swing swords
I just punch it all in like a keyboard
There's plentiness when I always hope to be more
And appreciating assets, see-more
Three whores, it's just me bring three more
And my CDs sell by the sea-shore
Running with a crew of winners, you can keep score, score

[Hook]

[Outro]
Come and follow the Mellowhype way
That way, you're going the wrong way, I said that way
(Which way?) That way, dumb nigga

OF..Tyler like to say this so I'mma just say it
OFM banging on ya FM, yeah
Oh it's so just beautiful, ya feel me?
Left brain I feel this beat nigga, I know they feel this beat too
Fuck it, I'm out, have a good time listening to the rest of my shit
