A rapper & a lyricist, I'm kinda in the middle
Joeyy's blowing all this money, I ain't tryna spend a little
Cause Joeyy Alexx Hill got hella money in the back account
You other guys think otherwise cause I don't pull the Franklin's out
I don't care what you're thinking 'bout; your mindset is irrelevant
Sometimes I lose my mind & try to find it for the hell of it
Instead of shit talking, I just cut the chit chatter
Sit back & get stacks & watch my haters get madder
Six ladders stacked together's what my music is as high as
In the sky, telling birds to move it when I fly past
Do it 'til I die as the greatest rapper ever to
Cause give fuck & give it up is something that I'd never do

Presidential kush, my sticky on some Jimmy Carter shit
Heaven-sent, but look; I'm hot as hell & spitting arsenic
I'm 'bouts to take the cake these fakes ain't even getting part of it
I'm hopping in the game without a manual or starter kit
Some harder shit, the bars I spit; compared to all these other guys
I'm writing, otherwise I'd be somewhere higher than butterflies
Raps as fat as thunder thighs, yet my cash is undersized
On my own, I'm all alone like bastards when their mother's die
