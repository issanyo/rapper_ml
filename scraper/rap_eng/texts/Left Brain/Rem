Affan said the borough needs an anthem
I told him roll up, shit I got him
Something to make the wholes true city stand up
Like 50 did, I got em

[Verse 1]
Let the reefer hit my brain
Then I roam around shitty streets just to maintain/
Take some more hits, exhale from my lungs
If you feel this shit, nigga then rep where you from
I'm on my QUEENS SHIT!
Where niggas could come through tear your block up
Went to Amazura 1 time, it got shot up
So I stayed my side of things, house parties in Corona
Dubbin on a Puerto Rican shorty said her brother was ni√©ta
Love, I don't need that drama, none of my niggas packed the llama
But we down to knuckle up and scrap if we have to
Running and ducking from the police? Shit I'm used to it
Scuffed the Bapes hoppin fences
Now I'm get chauffeured hoppin outta Benz'
Besides my fam, I'm worried  bout 1 thing, that's my team
And my team only worried bout 1 thing, that's the cream

[Verse 2]
This is crack the Henny music
Split the Dutch, stuff the philly music
This is 60 on the northern state
On your way home, shorty giving you dome
It feel good don't it?
Like a nostalgic breathe of fresh air
I'm in my own lane, ain't nobody else can compare
Or make what I'm giving you here, cause this all city authentic
Most these niggas styles is rented
Like a limo with the windows tinted
Yo left brain, let that bass bang and leave they heads dented
Yeah they whips too
This is for my peoples in the QU
To all my homies wildin out in the Brooklyn Zoo
Harlem to LES, the bronx, Staten Island too
Rep your hood, rep your block, rep your whole crew
While I focus on my paper and do what I do
Cruise through your city, hoody up over the Yankee blue yellin...
