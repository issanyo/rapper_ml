[Intro: Adriiian]
Can't be no WunTayk Timmy...

[Verse 1: Adriiian]
I had a dream that I was still dope
Going off the bars, I'm just spitting what the pill wrote
This the type of shit that kills folks
Focused on the tension they be setting, we just tryna send a message
Yes I represent the Syndicate
Sent here on a mission just to kill this shit
All I do is cyph and spit, my momma fucking sick of it
Roll another J, just remind me if you spliffing it
Pass the Dutch and fuck up all my sentences
Got me smacked, got me spitting different shit
Going in a little bit
Picked the wrong nigga to go in
Because I won't stop until I cop the win
And leave these others niggas blowing in the wind
It all depends when
Let these niggas know I'm never afraid to commit a sin
If you doubt my fucking skills with manipulating a pen
I could've sworn I could turn verses to gold
Go toe to toe with every rapper that I know
Just to prove the fucking Oxleys boutta blow
We boutta be on our conglomerate shit
I think this cheeba got me seeing shit, no oculus rift
And as for now, no more edibles, I'm not with the shits
Unless you can't afford to cop me a brick
In that case, find the plug, run his pockets, pop a shot and then dip
Then treat my fifty closest niggas to some lobster and shrimp
You know, I'm on my nautical shit, your bitch is naughty as shit
And now she's sitting on the top of this dick

[Verse 2: Eli Ash]
Wait til I catch the vibe, step up and then testify
Are these guys really dope or are they just passing pot?
All night, no Camelot
Everyone's got a price
Only question's could you be bought?
We'll all be lined in chalk
Til then I'll be writing arsenic
Making flame like an arsonist
Renegade in the flesh
Been amazing, some gawk at it
(Alright alright I get it I get it, put a sock in it)
Lately I've been depressed, so I think I need more confidence
I'm trash, I'm throwing lines out faster than I can jot this shit
Bitter spit since that much is sweet
Mind sharper than cutlery
Pine Sol isn't fresh as me
Hungrier than some coyotes
Ready to eat whatever's in front of me
Buzzing like a bumblebee
It's off the top, guillotine
Shining like some shrines in the Phillipines
