[Verse 1: Charlie Haylee]
Thinking bout how much of my life I wasted away
My cheekbones titanic, body wasted away
What can I say
All the food in the world
Can't make up for the fact
That when it's emotional hunger
Your cheeks could never get fat
Now picture that, a happy couple lying in the green grass
A couple true friends, being real, no need for the masks
Now can I ask
Do this shit only exist in movies
Because real life is bum homies trying to bum some loosies
Off a hobo at the dunkin
Donuts we be huntin
Wash em down with jack and coke, drinking like I'm a glutton
Or something
This beat ain't dark enough, switch it up
Before I down what's in this Dixie cup

(Beat Switch)

[Verse 2: Izzy Blue]
Bitch, go tell Kelly to fuck herself
She was a ray of hope until she let the candle melt
From the flames that my life was going up in, assumption:
I'm a fuck up who never had the gumption
To do shit with his life
If you thought that, you'd be right
Cause I really a need a light beer or two
Perhaps a haircut too
So I can jack the barbers razor, slit a wrist or two
Blood-spattered black jeans, keep the sweater blue
And the sperrys gray
As my god-forsaken face is
Shoes is always laceless
So when I die, taking them off will be painless
Guess I'm kinder to the dead than the living
Nicer to the coroner than my friends and my siblings
But at least the mortician never did shit to me
That's more than I can say for the friends that screwed me
