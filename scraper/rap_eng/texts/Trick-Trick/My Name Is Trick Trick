The People Vs
My Name Is Trick Trick
[Conversation:]
What's up man?
What's up kid, what's goin on?
What's the deal? Been hearin a lot of shit about you lately, man
Yeah, man, I heard they said you whooped [Trick Daddy] and sayin that you broke your arm
And motherfuckers is sayin, uh, you still fucking wit that work
Seeing that my name happens to be the topic of discussion
In everybody's conversation, all across the nation
I'm gon' hit it, cause people gotta lie just to kick it
It's a program plan so get wit it
Now listen to me, I started bangin' when I turned thirteen
Affiliation with felons had me linked to a team
Seven Mile BK rep the set
Click, Boom, GBK from east to west
Back then we wasn't friends wit a na' 'notha crew
Gang fights after school had me labeled as a fool
Run yo shoes, run yo jewels. Sheepskins, top tens. Check 'em in
Blocks and ink pens was the weapon, till I got a three-fifty-seven
When Dougie Fresh had just dropped All The Way to Heaven
Tough chains, I got from everybody else
I present to you, Myself
My name is Trick-Trick
I'm from the ghetto
I fuck's wit Hip Hop, R&B
Not Heavy Metal
I'm still a gangsta
So please believe it
I got that choppa'
Bring the drama you will see it
(bi-atch!)
Wasn't no way to taim us, we love beef
The OG's that trained us, they loved streets
It's hard to lie for that
If I believed it in my heart, it's hard to die for that
If the homie get killed, it's hard to ride for that. (what?)
It's hard to ride for that. Ride for that
I'm on yo head niggas
Still the fact of the matter remains, I can't change
I'm addicted to this game
So when these fag-ass rap niggas split the track
And can't do none of the shit that they spit on wax
Bump into me, then mug like it's something to see
Anybody can get they ass whooped fuckin wit me
So close your mouth and stop spreading the shit you heard
I'm at the point where I can clip a motherfucka with words
Move that work, top charts, and gang to fame
Everybody in the streets know, that..

(Ohh shit, there he go again.)
I been in the pen, copped out, probated and did it again
I paroled the homie own, It's time to shine
But kept getting arrested for violent crimes
That's right. Believe the witness, it's all my fault
My guess is, beat the witness, till he can't talk
I was taught, gone and do, what you gotta do
To make sure they don't tell on you. Oooh
But people still say what they heard anyway
I get birds everyday, I got indited back in May
Trick Daddy broke my arm?
Come on, you saw the tape, ain't no body breaking shit this way
And further more, all these rap niggas that I had to run in to
Got they ass whooped cause they had it comin to 'em
I don't whoop na' nigga for nothin
You got stomped then you had to do something. Bi-atch!
