[Intro]
Hm crazy
They say everybody deserve a shot at love
That's bullshit
You live your entire life as a miserable bitch
Then you deserve to die a miserable bitch
Fack you
Good lookin' Em
Jump fast(?)
Trick Trick

[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
Chick(?) to the waitress being me
I frequent the joint so she sees in me
More than an average customer
I trusted her
To bring to me what I ordered
Even a bottle of water
Met her in a (?) grabbed my (?)
All these legs and thighs
That catched my eyes
I got my mind on this five foot one
1-23
I lead her home to go out to see
Her ride the beat without the poles
She don't serve for free
She out for dope
The hustles(?) is clean and respectable
But (???)
But the way she came, whenever I called
Or waved my hand, you gotta understand
This (?) right here, had me gone
I knew(?) one day I drive her home
The day then came that she sat with me
It was a saturday, the club was empty
V.I.P. room, all alone
32 shots of patron (Damn!)
I know she gone, she can't drive
Big old(??) (??)
Takes us home, I can't lie
I wanna bone, but I'm to high
Not that I would take advantage of her
Cause I got patience and planning for her
Sunday morning she left my crib
She had to leave to get home to the kids
She rolled with me, spent the night
So why would I believe otherwise

[Hook: Throatslash]
I won't let them hate me (?)
She wanted a baby (?)
She's calling the police
I won't let them take me
She knew I'd fight back
I know she was like that
She scrambled(?) a signature
I swear she ain't write that
The way she was safety(?)
The way she could play me
Boms(?) are closing in, i'm patiently waiting
She offered to pay me
I thought it would ..ay(?) me
Despite what she may be
That woman is crazy

[Verse 2: Trick Trick]
I like the fact that she laid with me
She said she had something to say to me
So much for the layout, so much for the plans
To my surprise, she got a man
Told me she was on her way to breaking up
So the vision of me and her waking up
After making love
Was far from death
The night was young, we laid in the bed
She had to leave to get home to him
Aggravated when I'm her thinking alone with him
She on the phone with him
Touched (?) dog but she's sucking on my lollipop (Damn!)
Can you believe this shit? (What?)
I am leaving this
Cause I can't see her leaving him (hell no)
It's been six months
And all me and her, whatever we did was fuck
And that's whats up
I got me one, but not the one that I'm speaking of
I'm out for love, but not with her
I've found me one that that get me what I'm dreaming of
I told it all out front of her line(?)
She told me no, she needed more time (What?)
I came to gree(?) this falling(?) yet
She keeps seducing me, calling for sex
Starting to pig(?) with a men at home
When all she did was trip when she had my phone
Like:"Who's that?, Who's this?"
Well, who is she to check(?) about another bitch? (What?)
I couldn't take another step further with (That's right)
This ignorance, she had to go
I told her to leave, she told me no
I forced her out, then slammed to door

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trick Trick]
So whatever this is, it had to stop
I knew for sure that she called the cops (What?)
They came to the door with a:"Knock! Knock! Knock!"
I thought it was her man, so I cocked my Glock
Y'all know me I asked her boat(?)
Damn police, you wouldn't believe what this men told me
Told me he loved to see me go
When all he had was a P.P.O.(?)
Slammed my door, now I'm pissed of about that ho
But that didn't take the cake or change the flight
Thief in the middle of the night
This last (??) Benz
Stole a sim-card and called my friends
Took a picture of her(?) ultra sound
With a note attached:"What you gon' do now?"
Sought me out with my brand new chick
She rode upon me:"Is that your bitch?"
Told me she wanted to kill herself
Eat a shotgun and and kill herself
I passed(?) for gas
Grabbed the .45 from out the stash
If she chase me then that's her ass
You can't catch me in my car too fast
Hold my cash(?), text my phone
Now i'm hurt(?) bitch told the feds
That I got the word(?)
Called my lawyer, checked it out
The alpha bitches(?) outside your house
Now this gon' get you most of all
She asked the judge and she post a bond(?)
On my behave she spoke up
It's 7 AM and I woke up

(coughing)

Man
Pfeww
Hell no
Gotta get my ass up

[Hook]
