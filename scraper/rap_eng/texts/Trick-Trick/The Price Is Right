[Chorus]
Yeah!
I'll run through it all, if the price is right
Show you niggas how to ball, if the price is right
You wanna sell that Chevy on fours, Cadillac on fours[?]
I'll get it, if the price is right
I'll buy out the club, if the price is right
Showing everybody love, if the price is right
Look here, I spend it like that, cause I get it right back
Why is that? The price is right
Okay then

[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
Its the d-boy doing d-boy shit
Got them hollering "God damn that boy Trick
He'll never stop" for real though
Stealin'[?] what the fuck your deal do?
All the hating y'all doing so senseless
I spend money everyday like it's Christmas
With no 9-to-5 I got business
It's a couple more rap niggas on the hitlist
If the price is right give me the shipment
The quick flip flip quick like a gymnast
Get your mouth right I'll get the witness
And they can catch me on the big screen under "Christian"
I'd get a hundred of them I'm going the distance
With five butt naked hood rats in the kitchen
One into one-and-a-half like a magician
Now watch these niggas flip these pigeons[?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Trick Trick]
I'm getting money and nothing you can do about it
Goon Sqwad up top so true about it
I got respect for that clique that you with
But you better turn it down when Trick Trick in this bitch
They say I love to scrap and that might be true
But you ain't shit nigga, why should I acknowledge you?
New world hustle, M.O.B
That's Money Over Bitches, cuz with a 'c'
Unstoppable, you see it
I'll give my last to the Sqwad if they need it
Put a boss on it, I O.G. it
They take me and my guerillas[?] to do it then so be it
These niggas talk aloud, but homie I don't see it
Save yourself, little nigga, I'm undefeated
Everytime I win these niggas claiming I cheated
You ain't talking money nigga, beat it!

[Chrous]

[Verse 3: DIEZEL]

Wake up hoes, it's 7 o'clock
It's the Mario Brothers going after them blocks
Busting up them bricks hitting twenties and zips [?]
And niggas dizzy as shit from doing all these flips
You waiting on them bits, we waiting on that ship
It ain't Frito-Lay's but I got them chips
Its Better Made bitch this Detroit shit
CGSM, we run this bitch
That's it, that's all, dont get it fucked up
You prank you already go ahead boss up[?]
On point we here all ready for whatever
On deck right here whereever
I'm the king of rock the queens get higher
I won't stop cooking I won't retire
No, I'm gonna find my brand so tight
Bob Barker out here my price so right

[Chorus x2]
