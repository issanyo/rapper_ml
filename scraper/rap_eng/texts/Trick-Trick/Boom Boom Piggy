[Verse 1: Big Hoodoo]
So I guess you can just choke me out!
Slam me on the ground, and kick me in the mouth!
Well fuck it I ain't shit that's how they treat niggas
Still see us like slaves that's why they beat niggas
No peace in this streets and I'm telling you right now
The heat to your check I ain't going like Mike Brown
A gun and a badge don't make you above me
If I shot you first only god can judge me
Fuck Ice Cube and Ice-T, fuck the police, I'm a cop killer
Thug life still living in it, word to Pac nigga
I stay strapped up like packing a Akon
Keep my hoody on still reaping that Trayvon
We murdered every day it don't matter you color
They ain't serving and protecting they just killing my brothers
Stand up and come together or will never survive
Man up, this is a war, you better choose your side

[Hook: Big Hoodoo]
Violate my right, violate my right
Then it's boom boom piggy (boom boom piggy!)
Gonna take my life, gonna take my life
Then it's boom boom piggy (boom boom piggy!)
Gonna kill my people, gonna kill my people
Then it's boom boom piggy (boom boom piggy!)
Gonna make murder legal, gonna make murder legal
Then it's boom boom piggy (boom boom piggy!)
Boom boom piggy! boom boom piggy!

[Verse 2: Big Hoodoo]
Tell me why you automatically don't trust me
Is it the way I dress or you just like fuck me
I survived past 25 present of me lucky
And piggies want blood they ain't trying to bust me
Ain't nobody addressing the elephant in the room
If you think its bad now martial law coming soon
I'm just telling you right from my point of view
If a gang come for you and your crew what you gonna do
Go hard for the squad or you gonna hide and cry
I go to war for my people I'm a ride and die'
So I'm a keep it to myself cuz I'm a get killed for keeping it real, Anybody knows I'm fear for your life on a daily basis
Boom boom piggy in they face's
Fuck them cuz they racist
Ever sense I has a kid all they ever did was fuck with me
Beat my ass in a cop car while I was in custody

[Hook: Big Hoodoo]
Violate my right, violate my right
Then it's boom boom piggy (boom boom piggy!)
Gonna take my life, gonna take my life
Then it's boom boom piggy (boom boom piggy!)
Gonna kill my people, gonna kill my people
Then it's boom boom piggy (boom boom piggy!)
Gonna make murder legal, gonna make murder legal
Then it's boom boom piggy (boom boom piggy!)
Boom boom piggy! boom boom piggy!

[Outro: Big Hoodoo]
