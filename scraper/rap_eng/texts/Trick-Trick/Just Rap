[Intro: Kid Vishis]
Yeah
When it's on, it's on
You needa show respect
Or get disrespected, nigga

[Verse 1: Kid Vishis]
Is it worth risking ya' life to start war?
Two celebrities beefin', that's called Star Wars
Bust a gun, show me you really hardcore
Twin cities turn to city in the dark vore
And, I ain't swangin' hollin' like it's part four
We not leavin' till the blood from ya' heart pours
It's gonna be a dark storm for the art form
When it sparks, the pain raise enough to drown sharks
Have his love fest with a young Balboa
The animal that walked on the ark and turned on Noah
I'ma flow where you would fly with devour, you take ya power too
Only thing you seen was my Jordans, was power blue
Mean box game, jab with a counter too
I run up, he on his ass before he count to two
Trained soldier, could play chicken with a locomotive
While jogging and run the fuckin' train over
Let me explain something, I'm just a man of respect
The man in the check (yes)
So if I ever decide to break ya' neck
It's not cause I'm tryin' to gain somethin'
Not cause you crossed my mind
Cause you crossed that line
While I explode, you step off that mine
You could never throw me off my grind
What's emergent?
You know you can't penetrate like dinner date and virgins
We could scrap, nigga
You're just a punk ass rap nigga

[Chorus: Kid Vishis]
It's over, it's over
You just disrespected a soldier, a soldier
If you an actor then act
You a clapper then clap
But you just a punk ass rap nigga
So just rap nigga

It's over, it's over
You just disrespected a soldier, a soldier
If you an actor then act
You a clapper then clap
But you just a punk ass rap nigga
So just rap nigga

[Verse 2: Trick Trick]
A real nigga link up with them killers, one touch down
(Oh yeah you see it)
I'm that gentleman from that one time
Chicks on my ass cause niggas callin' me kung pow
[?] ass pieces of shit still get shut down
Get the fuck on, nigga
I told one clown "beating the fuck out of you soon as I put this Blood down"
That's right, run coward
Before you have a nigga washin' off gunpowder
It's blood shower
My niggas gotta eat
Guaranteed the next disrespect a nigga gonna be pushing up sunflowers (this nigga knows he a bitch)
You wanna stunt now?
Wonder why these pussy ass niggas be gettin' gunned down
It's bout' the respect, for the streets
And I can't respect a nigga that'll tweet for a beef
Some fight for a like
Or it could turn into one sadder gunfight overnight (nigga)
Past sunlight
You could be under a floodlight
And everybody talkin' what you was like
And all the shit that you been bumpin' and them funky ass raps
You lost yo' life and only ended up with one mic
Aight?
Look here
Go tighten up ya skill nigga
And watch that pen when you writin' off that pill, nigga
I don't play that shit, and I'm for real, nigga (it's a no fly zone)
Fuck around and get killed, nigga

[Chorus: Kid Vishis]
It's over, it's over
You just disrespected a soldier, a soldier
If you an actor then act
You a clapper then clap
But you just a punk ass rap nigga
So just rap nigga

It's over, it's over
You just disrespected a soldier, a soldier
If you an actor then act
You a clapper then clap
But you just a punk ass rap nigga
So just rap nigga

(Yeah!)
(Come on!)
(Yeah!)
