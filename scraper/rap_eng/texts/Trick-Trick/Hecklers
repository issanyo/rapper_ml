[Intro]:
Yo
If you ain't come to have a good time
You ain't come to show love
The fuck on with that hating ass shit
Yo
I brought a couple of Detroit's finest with me
And on that outlet track boys real quick
Kuniva, Trick Trick, and I'm The R.O.C
Lets go

[Verse 1: The R.O.C.]:
Get up out the way
These ninjas wanna get it live right here bitch
Move to the side bitch
Get your right bitch
Get stomped and matched
Till the lights fade out bitch
All you do is bite shit
Pipe down for your casters mic
Sit your whole and faculty down
Down with the sounds of the roc
And its fallen offbeat
They can't fuck with me
Yall teach your young shit pollute
These cocksuckers want to dispute
And if they do they just stup
Duckin through the crowd
They root when they see me
I'm on my motherfucking grind
I'm rooted
The look up on they face is foolish
When I spit sicker when I lube it
Serial killas stay secluded
In these rhymes i've exuded
All your insides are ruined
No way out this mess you got caught in yeah
Where your world collapse knowing there
I'm the problem
You see the visual stare
Stupid is as you fare
You heckle me cause I handle my biz
And stay out your mixed up trip
In a simp
That'll never fucking change on my side
That fact you a bitch and you can eat this dick

[Hook]:
You chose the wrong path you heckling bitch
Them words are cross cause of the heckling with
It's cool if crews don't like what I spit
Close your mouth and just mind your shit
Close your mouth and just mind your shit
It's cool if crews don't like what I spit
Them words are cross cause of the heckling with
You chose the wrong path you heckling bitch
Hell nah ain't fucking with yall
Up in the crowd now he gon fall
Said the wrong shit now you can't pause
Bodies hit the ground like salt the door
Hell nah fuck yall



[Verse 2: Kuniva]:
I be feeling it
Keeping shit going to the fullest
Hang with the hoodlums
Dodging the bullets
Pull up with the homies drunk as hell
Everyone know that we down with the bullshit
I'm on some fucking hater shit
All in the crowd saying they hating shit
The crew will spray your clique up
And turn around and take your bitch
What you think gon happen if you keep yapping off
While I'm up here rapping
You gon make us start a brawl
I guarantee you don't wanna start scrapping
It's always that one guy in the group
That tries to test his luck
Who screams the wrong shit in the crowd
And get beat the fuck up
Then you try to talk it out
And kick some shit like I'm all about unity
Be the same person in the courtroom
Pointing the finger now your momma and em suing me
So if you wanna make it home in one piece
If you came to the show only one deep
Keep your motherfucking mouth closed
Or you'll be screaming out
Niggas is joking

[Hook]:
You chose the wrong path you heckling bitch
Them words are cross cause of the heckling with
It's cool if crews don't like what I spit
Close your mouth and just mind your shit
Close your mouth and just mind your shit
It's cool if crews don't like what I spit
Them words are cross cause of the heckling with
You chose the wrong path you heckling bitch
Hell nah ain't fucking with yall
Up in the crowd now he gon fall
Said the wrong shit now you can't pause
Bodies hit the ground like salt the door
Hell nah fuck yall

[Verse 3: Trick Trick]:
It's some of this
How in the fuck do you think that when I'm on the stage with the mic in my hand
That the things I've done in the past
Won't make me get your motherfucking ass
You son of a bitch
Still on the marquee
Oh so you bought a ticket to disturb me
You tryna fuck up my party
You really want this from my team
Well I got zero tolerance for bad manners
I got the flow and you wanna stab at her
And I ain't no rapper goddamnit
I do what I want
And they can't stand it
No way in the fuck am I satanic
But I beat em till I'm in a straitjacket
You stopping my show it just ain't cracking
It's too late when you hear the gate cracking
Ah ah
Squad or something
I ain't lacking
When that leg thrust
And that head bustin
So your pussy ass just said something
You dead bitch
That way up front
Get a visit up to the front door
Stop you and the bitches stunt for
You dead bitch
That web frontin
Get that visit up to the front door
(fuck you trick trick!)
Get em
