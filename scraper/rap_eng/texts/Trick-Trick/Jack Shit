[Verse 1: Frenchie]
This a jack move, go on your boy
I'm taking everything, even the door
Frenchie, why you mean? I need that green
Shut the fuck up bitch, that's what I'ma fucking scream
Oh you flossing? Them VV's?
I'm Trick Trick in my city, or the new supreme
What's up, get your whole head knocked off, you wanna mack get the fuck up
Robbing got a nigga trying to come up
Oh, I got you? That's tough luck
You better join the army nigga, cause these streets is really not for you
Fight for your country, I bet you still end up in that soil
I got a pot that's hot, that we boil
I got a wrist game, it's so loyal
I got watch running through all blocks
So fire, you could still see the oil
I'm finna' crack your head, you're so fucked up
No crack spots, that's fucked up
No crack pipe? You assed out
You can still use aluminum foil
My boys in the hood, us against the odds
You on some Trae shit, let me out the car
I call a crip a crip, don't call me a slob
Cause if I flip the clip, the news gon' be on every block

[Hook: Young 1000]
Money is the subject, how to get it is the lesson
If you come around my hood, then you better have that weapon
On that jack shit
They be on that jack shit
Money is the subject, how to get it is the lesson
If you come around my hood, then you better have that weapon
On that jack shit
They be on that jack shit

[Verse 2: Trick Trick]
Who the fuck left the gate open?
Better let out the big dog
I sent them to get y'all
You taking that shit off
They hollering, Trick no
You see me, I'm pissed off
And going through withdrawals
Nigga, it's all raw
Get your face cracked, boy cut in a big brawl
It's either take that, boy watching his bitch crawl
Somebody lay down on the floor
Bleeding from the fucking face, no drag his ass up out the door
They claiming he ain't cut like that, then what the fuck he faking for?
Beat his ass again, fuck him
Take his shit, and let him go
If you ain't heard the no fly zone, that means you niggas slow
You ain't welcome in my city, bitch
Now you know

[Hook]
