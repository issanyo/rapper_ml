Mm, don’t worry too much
Because from now on these things will happen many more times
Don’t get hurt too much
Because for sure you will hurt someone without knowing but still live
Don’t hate too much
Because humans can’t be perfect and it’s the same for me
Don’t be too sad
Because we know happiness, we feel sadness
Only on days when it is about to rain, you unnecessarily DM that you are getting sentimental
When you are like that, play a sad song
It is human to be sad when you are sad, only pretend to be strong outside
Sometimes swim in your emotions
It’s fine to shout and swear when you are mad but
As some observe you, they will surely leave
Just stop being stuck in the past over things that already passed please
If It’s 11 I’ve endured enough, now I will leave you alone

It’s time to go cause soon be 11
It’s time to go cause soon be 11
It’s time to go cause soon be 11
It’s time to go cause soon be 11
It’s time to go cause soon be 11
It’s time to go cause soon be 11

Not the type to give or receive warm words
What are you looking at paranoia
I stretch out what is said playfully
The statement “I am me” is invincible
The word “goodbye” is dull
I hope you will be happy, obviously I shrink the sides of the affectation
In front of the me walking away, you told me the method to keeping me
Relationships are puzzles, to match perfectly you excavated me
Now it seems that I don’t like even that, pleased with anything
A norm in which there is disappointment if you trust, I won’t have emotions
What time is it now? Sorry, I have to go now
My mood is good, but I just have to go
What time is it now? Sorry, I have to go
I don’t want to ruin the mood but I have to go
What time is it now? Sorry, I have to go
Inside my head is white from the accumulation of today’s thoughts
What time is it now? Sorry, I have to go
If it’s 11 I have endured enough, now I have to be myself

Break down (break down), break out (break out)
Let’s run away until we get to the front of our house
Everybody turn down (turn down), turn out (turn out)
It’s time to be honest, even up to my insides
Everybody so what, so what (so what)
What do you want me to do? Until all (beep)
Everybody go down (go down), go out (go out)
Even up to the insides that you have kept locked up
Everybody so break out (break out), break down (break out)
Turn down (turn down), turn out (turn out)
So what (so what), so what (so what)
Go down (go down), go out (go out)

[Verse 1]
음, 너무 걱정하진 말어
음, 앞으로 그런일이 훨씬 더 많을테니까
음, 너무 상처받진 말어
음, 분명 너도 모르게 누구 상처주고 살테니까
음, 너무 미워하지 말어
음, 인간은 완벽하지 못해 나도 매한 가지니까
음, 너무 슬퍼하지 말어
우린 행복을 알기에 슬픔이란것도 느끼니까
괜히 니가 비가 오는 날만 되면 센치해진다는 DM
그럴 떄는 슬픈 노랠 틀어
슬플때는 슬퍼야지 인간이지 강한척은 밖에서나 해
가끔은 니 감정에 수영
화날땐 소리치고 욕을 해도 좋아 But
너를 지키다 보면 일부는 너를 떠날거야 꼭
이미 다 지난 일에 미련 갖지 말아 그냥 좀
11시면 많이 버텼지, 이젠 널 내버려둬

[Verse 2]
너무 따뜻한 말은 주고받지 못하는 타입
뭘 꼬라봐요 피해망상
장난 투로 뱉은 말을 늘어트려
'난 나여'라는 문장은 무적
'잘 가요'라는 말은 무뎌
부디 행복하길 바래, 당연히 가식 옆을 줄여
가는 내 모습 앞에서 말한 날 지키는 방법
관계는 퍼즐, 딱 맞기 위해 나를 팠어
이젠 그것도 싫더라고 뭐라도 기뻐하고
믿다보면 실망이 있는 법 안 가져 감정
지금 몇 시야? 미안, 이제 가야해
기분 좋지 나, 근데 그냥 가야해
지금 몇 시야? 미안, 이제 가야해
분위기 망치는게 싫지만 근데 나는 가야해
지금 몇 시야? 미안 이제 가야해
오늘 쌓인 생각들에 머리속은 하얗게
지금 몇 시야? 미안, 이제 가야해
11시면 많이 버텼지, 이제 나는 나야해

[Outro]
Break down (break down), break out (break out)
도망가자 우리 집 앞까지
Everybody turn down (turn down), turn out (turn out)
솔직해질때야 저 안 까지
Everybody so what, so what (so what)
뭐 어쩌라고 다 (삐) 까지
Everybody go down (go down), go out (go out)
너를 가둬놨던 니 안 까지
Everybody so break out (break out), break down (break out)
Turn down (turn down), turn out (turn out)
So what (so what), so what (so what)
Go down (go down), go out (go out)
