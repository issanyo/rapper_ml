Hangul

[Hook: Ann One]
Better duck down
Better watch out
Keep your head low
Before you get knocked out
You shook and it's only the first round
Feel Ghood in the house everybody say ye

[Verse 1: Maniac]
이어가는 story 한방에 안 끝나길 바라는 기도
이쯤 되면 포기할 줄 알았지 not me though
가진 건 많이 없지만 확실한 건 내 실력
세월에 폐인 내 주름만큼 깊어진 내 필력
모두 다 똑같이 싹 다 I call it copy
등 돌리고 외면하며
어설프게 따라하지

Get booted out like Kaddafi
그 누구도 날 못 막지
피부색은 어두워도 내 미래는 아주 밝지
Ugh 나만의 flow로 yea I keep it poppin
Ugh 모두에 가슴속에 영원하길
Got certified by the OGs luv to bizzy and JK
기회가 왔으니 1shot its payday

[Verse 2: Black Nine]
9 gon give it to ya
이 싸움의 새로운 다크호스
내가 쓰러질 줄 알았냐 너넨 이미 틀렸어
나의 고집이 투영된 마이크는 할렐루야
이젠 내 옆엔 수어사이드 스쿼드 크루 whoa
It's time to kill em in billions
언더독의 반란 check it
저 놈들 뜻대로 살지 말고 널 보여줘
뺏기지 말고 개겨 널 볼 수 있게
주연을 인수인계 무시했던 분들께 먹여줘
Uhm pow you better get off my back
더 낮고 어두운 곳으로 향할 거란 걸 뱉어
아무것도 아닌 놈들도 할 수 있단 걸 보여줘
Get'em all get'em all get'em get'em all get'em all

[Verse 3: A-Sol]
넌 말해 바꿀 수 없는 게 있지
그건 딱 봐도 비주얼래퍼 귀요미
엄마 기다리라고 했잖아 딱 이년
그니까 공주라 부르지 마
I wanna be king
손안에 내일 믿음이 돈 대신
이젠 내 뒤에 전설들과 함께해
다음 페이지에
이 기집애가 최초란 말을 쓰네
버킷 리스트도 체크해
Uh 매일 매일 세끼 네끼 먹는 기분
배가 터지겠지
아냐 아직은 웃지 마 엄마
그때 우리가 흘린 눈물은
영원히 마르지 않아

[Verse 4: Bizzy]
괴로웠담 참고 있던 것 다
한방에 다 let it out
겁내지 마 u better duck down
Better watch out 점차 좁혀진 격차
비꼬는 말들 같아 얘
Before you get knocked out
몇 번을 말해 hiphop that I know
I Trying to keep my soul clean
이 바닥에 이미 다 버린 몸
몸 사린 적 없어 엄살인 적 없어
I'll take my chances got dam it

[Tiger JK]
노란색 묶음 파란색 묶음
보이는 게 전 부인 세상 어두운
쇼 네 어차피
Truman show 이대로 속아가지

[Outro: Woo WonJae]
엄마 나 아들이야 오랜만이네
많이 놀랬을 거 알어 내 노래 땜에
그냥 모르는 척 해줘 그게 난 편해
그냥 어른인척 해줘 절대 나는 안 변해
다들 그래 괜찮아 쉽게 안 죽어 인마
쉽게 말하지 마라 그게 날 죽여와 인마
이 빛이 날 향하지만 나 더 이상
여기를 원치 않지 너네다 저리가 야
아직도 내가 영웅 같냐고 난 여기를 저주해
우리 모두 똑같은 거라고 도대체 신은 어디에
이런 게 인간이라면 난 그딴 건 거부해
그냥 모르는 척 해줘 비트 좀 꺼줘 ay

This continuing story, I pray it won’t be over at once
They thought I’d give up at this point, not me though
I don’t have much but one thing I’m sure of is my skill
My power of the brush stroke deepened as much as the wrinkles that time gave
Everyone’s the same, I call it copy
They turn around and awkwardly copy everyone

Get booted out like Kaddafi
No one can stop me
My skin may be dark but my future is bright
Ugh with my own flow, yea I keep it poppin
Ugh hope it’ll stay forever in everyone’s hearts
Got certified by the OGs luv to bizzy and JK
I got a chance, 1shot its payday

9 gon give it to ya
A new dark horse in this fight
Did you think I’d fall? You’re wrong
My stubbornness brought this mic, hallelujah
Now I have my Suicide Crew, whoa
It’s time to kill em in billions
The rebellion of the underdogs, check it
Don’t just live however you want, show yourself
Don’t let it be taken away, stay so you can show yourself
Transfer it over and feed it to those who ignored you
Uhm pow you better get off my back
Spit out the concept of going to a lower and darker place
Show them that nobodies can do it too
Get’em all get’em all get’em get’em all get’em all

You say some things can’t change
Like my visual rapper, cutie image
My mom told me to wait just two years
So don’t call me a princess
I wanna be king
Tomorrow’s in my hands, faith instead of money
Now I’m with legends behind me
On the next page
They’re gonna write, this girl is the first
Check off my bucket list
Every day, I feel like I’m eating three or four meals
My stomach is exploding
Now, don’t laugh yet mom
Cuz the tears that fell back then
Won’t ever dry

If it was hard, everything you held it
Let it all out at once
Don’t be afraid, you better duck down
Better watch out, the distance has narrowed
Sounds like you’re being sarcastic
Before you get knocked out
How many times do I have to tell you? hiphop that I know
I Trying to keep my soul clean
My body is wasted on this scene
I’ve never held back, never faked it
I’ll take my chances got dam it

Yellow ties, blue ties
The world only acknowledges what can be seen
It’s a dark show, like the Truman Show
All being deceived

Better duck down
Better watch out

Mom, it’s your son, it’s been a while
I know you’re probably shocked because of my song
Just pretend you don’t know, that’s more comfortable for me
Just pretend I’m an adult, I won’t ever change
Everyone says, it’s ok, you won’t die easily dude
Don’t say that so easily, that’s what kills me dude
The light is on me but I don’t want it anymore
Everyone just go away
You still think I’m the hero? I curse this place
We’re all the same? Then where is God?
If this is what it means to be human, I’ll reject it
Just ignore me, turn off the beat, ay
