Legend has it
There's a large
Mind about
Four feet by
Five foot around
Hidden behind a movie
Screen, it is held against its will
In a glass tank
And forced to think about
Nothing but
Money, and money alone

It's nourished only on tap water
And is hastily wiped down twice a week
With damp newspapers
Its captors keep the huge mind in check
By introducing a precise combination of ch-ch-chemicals into its bloodstream

As a precautionary and more fundamental behavioral model
They also employ some 200 individuals whose sole purpose it is to whisper feverishly
And appear to be fearful in the presence of the large exposed and heaving mind
And the staff carries on like so
Around the clock, tick-tock
Until day 7
At the end of, this gets the giant mind a ten-minute break

[?]

Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind

On the final third of this recess
A nine year old girl is ushered in with a stethoscope around her neck
She is also on the payroll and it is her solitary task to

(Close your eyes tight...
Close your eyes tight...
Close your eyes tight...
Close your eyes tight...)
And kiss the poor mind softly on the glass

Feverish, in the glass tank, on tap money alone and money alone

Ahhhhh...
Ahhhhh...
Ahhhhh...
Ahhhhh...
Ahhhhh...
Ahhhhh...
Ahhhhh...
Ahhhhh...

Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
Money and the human mind
