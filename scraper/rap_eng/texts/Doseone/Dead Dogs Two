[Doseone and Why?]
From the height of the highway on-ramp we saw
Two dogs a-dead in a field
Glowing on the Oakland Coliseum green seats wasteland
Dogs, dogs we thought were dead
They rose up, rose up when whistled at
Their rib cages inflating
Like men on the beach being photographed

A guard dog, guard dog for what? for what?
Against overzealous penniless athletic fanatics
Getting into games through a hole in the fence
For the owner of the blue tarp tent
Pitched by a creek beneath an on-ramp

In the privacy, of the last three
Skin and bony trees, devoid of leaves
And us undeceased, and with our new CDs
Zipping on dead east, Oakland

[Hook]
It's hard to stand the sight of two dogs dead
Under a sky so blue
You have to stop the blood to your head
To fit the breath in front of you

We secretly long to be some part of a car crash
Long to see your arms stripped to the tendons
The nudity of swelling exposed vein
Webbing the back of your hand
To be a red tendoned dog
To be red tendoned dogs
Blood breathing by the side of the highway

[Doseone and Why?]
I long to be dead
Center of a curious crowd
To be touched
Sticky like nearly dried paint
Their soft silent stare, nursing your face
Anticipating the slightest pinch I flinch of pain
Everyone blank in accident awe
As the car crash fiberglass dust
Straight up settles on your raw muscle tissue

[Hook]

[Doseone and Why?]
To be a red tendoned dog
To be red tendoned dogs
To be red tendoned dogs
To be red tendoned dogs
To be dead center of a curious crowd

[Spoken Dialogue]
Taking a close look at, at what's around us there, there is some sort of a harmony
It is the harmony of... overwhelming and collective murder
