(Ongoing work - A lot is missing)

[Chorus: Doseone]
All I want my most beast issues get finally settled
Releasing a heat so hot it disinfects metal
All I want one acre that's utterly government free
And bag that beautiful thing that can only be destroyed by me
All I want my most beast issues get finally settled
Releasing a heat so hot it disinfects metal
All I want one acre that's utterly government free
And bag that beautiful thing that can only be destroyed by me

[Bridge: Both]
This could be your sacred place
This could be your change of faith
This could be your sacred place
This could be your change of faith
This could be your sacred place

[Verse 1: Mestizo]
All I ever really really wanted was an album
I'll put the drugs down, I'll put the guns down
I'm all thugged out, I'm a bad man
High on life 'til it crashlands
And I'm above class, I never copped out
Fairweather friends yeah they came and went
And when the rain it poured, [?]
Washed out, and a name on the wall
And now criss-crossed, and now they crossed out
[?]
Because they never really lived but they're talked about
[?]
Sea shore, grease floors
Reinforce until we clean more
So we believe more, to achieve more
If we ever had credit [?]

[Chorus]
All I want my most beast issues get finally settled
Releasing a heat so hot it disinfects metal
All I want one acre that's utterly government free
That (that) beautiful thing that can only be destroyed by me
All I want my most beast issues get finally settled
Releasing a heat so hot it disinfects metal
All I want one acre that's utterly government free
That (that) beautiful thing that can only be destroyed by me

[Verse 2: Doseone]
[??????]
When you dredge your friendship for a familiar face
And only get the no company a corpse makes
That's what's up with gangstas and geeks
Book smarter at streets
Animal is something you are, not you can keep
Cured meat you can eat without heat take weeks
And the knowledge of rot
The latter's all that I got
It's weak drops well remembered by me
Bittersweet, stoppable not
Forces of fears lay eggs in my ears and I like it
Like when the ongoing ends
And wishing bad things befall all bad friends
Now and again
Me being a good person, well...
That's the only thing I pretend

[Bridge]
This could be your sacred place
This could be your change of faith
This could be your sacred place
This could be your change of faith
This could be your sacred place
This could be your change of faith
This could be your sacred place
This could be your change of faith
