There is no paid born tribulation
Arduous enough true love laden
Vied to uncut for morsel of indignation
Are bound beyond touch, streaming logic or labor
Can't conduct, exquisite
Through the realms of ink empathy and implicit
Think elementally
All is spoken or written, isn't it?
And once having been experimentally envisioned in
Animated person's glaring eye
You can't communicate, live or even codify
Without such inklings, laced, magnanimous to the sense
Go ahead and try
And be mystified
Underhandedness of man to a pretense
Are exemplify the expansive gift
Called me, myself and I
Without a canvas, gentle devotion
And hence
Cerebellum medulla in emotion
Or get the heart and soul lingually interwoven
Hence, for the weak-seekers God sa
'Mankind is chosen, to fully partake'
Notice, not every purpose of primate
Is getting older
For the medium or in expressive
And every transient fiber and shred
Of her or him
Friend, you may begin to awaken
At any point, in, when, or what it questions
In short, show some respect for perfections
Last pack (enhancer?) left with humane connections
Then scribe out some soul with resurrected intention
Not accustomed to in these parts
Since perspective ascensions
Pass a little dark for the bottom-dwelling populace farce convention
And the clandestine are
Essence disciples, lesson the passive trifle
Totally typical tidal temperaments
Affliction of the vital
Your testaments of life
Cycle through the excrements internally
Or get your wits about you, earnestly
Curving your weight, inadvertently
On one leg, unscathed index finger
Realizing enlightenment
Treads earthlessly in retroactive security
Of whats destined, reflect assuredly
The clearing from which you compose is under protection
Of the mercifully arose through correction
Personally potent, peripheral visionary
So rest in, our radical endorphin vortex
And be among the mystics of cerebral cortex
Where we're all adored, suns and droplets
Of a greater head-rush
Welcome, intact eligible flux
Of emotion, spirit and mind thus
All infinite selves are intertwined
About the crux of unconditional blind creative trust

Left:
Trust, remain the unparalleled
Permits persisting to jump
From a severe brainstorm's got stung
Step back, scale, insight stain struck
As wonders clap pale the span of soul-lit skies
Setting tight feelings, wail humans liberal cries
Til our own moment prevails
When a gap in the the lyrics never tries
And catch worse benchmarks
Why? It's not a moving piece of art
I couldn't invigorate a part in these incredibly potentially
Charged sinks over experience
Embarks on a vantage of initiative' over
These emotionally stark foreshadows grasp hold of bars
Than all of ballpoint may ever are
Craft and found and join into structures
Such a ma-magnificent use of the writing
If none stutter the buoyantly innocent
So easily amused, subconsciously contrast
My leveled inner views
Who seemed only to stew adrift with more further
And keener in tune sense of the yet-to-be channeled soon
Murmured, as healing echoes of two cents, while in shambles
Usurper commemorated annals of insecurity
Gorge fears, your (?) owes
Candles, to be mailed decrees
Tear, providing contemporary debris cleared
The skull slips willingly beneath the queer
More cataclysmic hush, as ideal embodiment steps for flush
Before cluttered mind to fantastically thrust life force
Upon bluish lines
Of course ultimately, brittle paper is touched
Transgressing all secular confines

Right:
Otherwise neutralities for the stillborn
And large rocks and ill-advised by incorporated ones
Who want not again and again
Invoke these acts, rehash, master plan
You couldn't remain in, digitally orchestrated
And then shoved down throats through suspect temples
So when time shines next, glaze on over
And indulge the once removed cousin of purchasing power
Run along, browse, to where putting neon solicits, impairing judgement
And I bet, crude names, the label reads
'Strychnine' while the cover says 'good for you too'
In the neatest font, slicker than that fraction snapshot
No, I beg of you, don't jump
Make the most of deja-vu
Before assuming a position that once extinct 50
Plus or minus umpteen senses been swapped
For the latest in compact... shit
Something should turn on, chime or dong
Your private parts are being touched, and forcibly at that
It's okay, feel violated, anything but entertained
Or bound and gagged, rather than financed
Mister impulse, and his rarefied wood-ship quartet
Be nice to your tape-deck, after all
Personal components don't have a power button
It's no secret, every culture has technical difficulties
And bad levels, be complacent, me? I'll stay critical
And oh yeah, before you go
Don't take any fiberglass navels

And the labors of the lyricist underlined
His strange fellows, squinted ears, if you think inclined
The given becomes a must
Until no one image, vibration or line could be too much
Or any energy origin deemed minds
Only us fuse, commune and combine
By changes cusp, therefore no-one's blameless
While our generation proceeds to burn on and aimless
I haven't the faintest, what leads the disciple with experience famous
Or any more privileged for being so aimless
'But a power source is limitless,' heinous, molesters of the soul
Natural impotence remain in, which can sustain this day and age
Is mangy, frustrated, mane-less, prides of future shameless
Low blown ignoramus what's established my decrepit
Innocent stripper, You can't go against the grain
Whole persons would think quicker without your vanity clogging (?)
Be a stainless (?) is bigger, still it doesn't stop hither
As young women portray the whorey witch
High matriarch of slut-dom elects death bushes
Won't find fatal futility of guns are quite belligerently from
The not so distant land of insufficient funds and bastard sons
You're withering away at the hands of
Dogs and duns delighted to defoliate wherever some green may run
Then disperse to a slow trickle, offend and praising the sociopathic sickle
Over the very burning light
Which ripple your crumbling hides from dunes
Grossly disfigured nipples, so there you stand
Knowledgeably gleamed, and esteemed, poised to speak
In the orders, lime-lit green, atop a soapbox of the knees
Trusting screams, this time pause and wipe fortune slate clean
Before empowering slugs, do it to me
From those idolized lips, brother, things can always be better than this
Why not get a grip? Let the gaudy ode drip, and let the record skip
As you idle-ly hear enough to stitch
Showing them all how hip-hop exists independent of any
Poster, post or infanticide clip, love was what got us through
2 decades of "yes y'all" and it don't quit and if you feel need
Get back to it, by staking pain in what you hit
There's been enough, give me more a mind to eclipse
An eternity of altruistic shine all-round breakers with interest vested
Must have been re-aligned, your greatest strength will have only begun to climb
Forgive, thanks, peace, love
Maintain the forms bind, if I may be frank
Speaker and listener are two of a kind
While the mediums just tried out for better characters in line
What's content is ours to define
Within the clutch of ethereal downtime

There is no paid born tribulation
Arduous enough true love laden
Flied to uncut or morsel indignation
Are bound beyond touch, streaming logic or labor
Can't conduct, intact eligible flux
Of emotion, spirit and mind thus
All infinite selves are intertwined
About the crux of unconditional blind creative trust
If you think inclined, the given becomes a must
Until no one image, vibration or line could be too much
For any energy origin, these minds
Only us fuse, commune and combine by changes cusps
Speaker and listener are two of a kind
While the mediums just tried out for better characters in line
What's content is ours to define
Within the clutch of ethereal downtime..
