"Hi mom and dad, uh, I guess my schedule is gonna be something like this for the next seven months or so. I'll start training at Cannon Air Force Base. I'll be going to gunnery school there. I'll be learning how to, oh, shoot and drop bombs from the air I guess. After I finish up at Cannon I'll be reporting to Fairchild Air Force Base."

Hooray for Fairchild! (x4)

Dying men keep rifles in cello cases
Known with a beer as the deer eraser
They dress their boys in bright orange
And leave their daughters at home
Stripping meat, stretching skin for their musical men

The makers of guns will never go hungry
The makers of guns will never fill up
May their children always play murder weapon since stick

Abraham Lincoln never got offed
Because it wasn't on the television...
And that's all he got
Was his foot background in a tourist's shot
And his face framed by those old roman leaves
Dead-center on the front of a five spot

Abraham Lincoln jumped the gun
Julio Caesar jumped the gun
Emilio Zapata jumped the gun
2Pac and Biggie jumped the gun
Jesus Christo jumped the gun
Malcolm X jumped the gun
Mahatma Gandhi jumped the gun
Joan of Arc jumped the gun
Martin Luther King jumped the gun
John F. Kennedy jumped the gun
G-Dubyu might just jump the gun
John Lennon jumped the gun
