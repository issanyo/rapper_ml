(Incomplete. Dose's verse is fucking impossible.)

[ Mestizo ]

I was blinded by the sunshine so long
That I forgot what Mother Earth looked like

[ Chorus -- Doseone ]

You're next, your neck, your breath I'll take -- whoo!
Today, tonight, right now, might mean you
Let me show you weapon perfection in what I do
Anything to dishonor and dominate you

[ Verse 1: Doseone ]

Get 'em mad and high their hope
Get 'em at the throne
Get 'em ? the ghetto ?
Get 'em warm and cold
Get 'em asleep, when they coughing rocking sweats at the clinic
Get 'em healthy full of hubris and in fittest self-image
?
Cracking them open rapidly spoken
Prose and you hoping
Dramatically posed in a cloak made of woven
Skin and attitude
Young adult gave him attitude so he did what he had to do
When he went until ten and then lent you a sensitive friend
To get on the mend and then did it again
? the actor and the rapper he play
You shouldn't have crept out of your pavement today
Today's the day, the day you ?
?

(Prey get away til prey get caught)
(Rappers wouldn't lie to you)

???
Gonna eat you at the altar of your audience
And absence of recording that your puttin' it in

[ Verse 2: Mestizo ]



[ Chorus ]
