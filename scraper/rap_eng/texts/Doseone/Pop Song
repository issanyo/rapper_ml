Two, three
I can't do it without
Go

The wood man and his splintering self
The wood woman and her hollowing out
The wood man and his splintering self
The wood woman and her hollowing out
The wood man and his splintering self
The wood woman and her hollowing out

Elvis, what happened

Popsicle, the label stapled speaker
To the back of a sheep's throat
Tongue depressor with the width of a spatula suppressess all
Bah bah blah, bah bah blah, end end end quote

Cotton cotton candy
Cotton cotton candy
Cotton cotton candy
Spun anyway you like it

High school picture datin' l.a
Someone in the sky
Dies and you go back to bed
Sittin dull dare head
Two perfect strangers
Strangers carrying a matador
You can tell their strangers
Chasing themselves in the windows of shops
How can i be your lover?
When you snore a little louder
You can't take applause to bed
And a decent depression of the mind

And then we said, fuck
In our pop song, in our pop song

Elvis, what happened?
Cotton cotton candy
Cotton cotton candy
Cotton cotton candy
Spun anyway you like it

Hi kiddies
We're cramping and sweating and groaning with the rest of them
I'm trying to give you that dope you were talking about
We've already wrecked three records trying to perfect one
First satellite with thrashing machine
And then one thing or another
So maybe this thing isn't gonna turn out alright
These records are sure the real mccoy
Your voice sounded so real on the last one
I almost caught myself answering back a couple of times. . 
Well i'll see ya soon
Send another record if you have one
Being here is sure swell
We're gonna be on our vacation in. . 

Hello? who is this?
