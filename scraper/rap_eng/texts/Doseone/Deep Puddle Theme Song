[Slug:]
Descending on the center, from the outskirts of obscurity
With a raised fist, symbolization of the urgency
Strength blowing kisses and winks toward adversity
Subtle yet as vital as the ink on your currency...

[Sole:]
I’m currently spiraling sinking inking melatonin
Toning governing soft naturally firm in “lost
Fell off the edge of the whirlpool” thoughts
Intangible, in this civilization
Lacing loud scream slew attachment to parchment
In my apartment, we all wear yellow rubber jackets

[Slug:]
Give me some more i’d like to taste
Swallow it whole and wipe your face

[Alias:]
Tickling at your sense of thought
This square is brought for knowledge

[Doseone:]
Apply, it ripples twisting, twisting your gnomes trickle

[Sole:]
Or lack of the above, this crowd submerge yourself in puddles

[Alias:]
Light reflecting off soft waves
Make it a blurred aspect subject
To ponder the vertical dynamics of further respect
One cannot truly feel the mass between the top and bottom points
H20 is a symbolism we have chosen to use as an anointment, thoughts are sent
Thinking it skimming it skip in
Dip in my entire action creator and popular inflator
Flotation devices are your vices- dislocate your elevator
Later you will yearn and pray for liquid form break from the norm
Open wide face up to attempt to and take particles from the storm

[Doseone:]
You’ve thirst for substance of decisive ground
Twice as round as your skin’s tough, wait, no, further
We touch bottom and break surface depth as our eldest daughter
With your eyes and no one's fear

[Hook by Slug:]
I took a dip last week through the liquid that gathered
Near the tip of that peak that exists in my matter
I taught myself to survive without my feet on the ground
I never felt so alive as when I drowned...
[Doseone:
A pebble moistened, vines dripped, drip, blessed drip, were saved, a puddle...]

[Doseone:]
Bestill the shores bend and splash
Heavy rye on life preserve...

[Sole:]
But still pouring friend, i’m asking asphalt may i melt here
Beat down by the aquarium that we all deserve to break from

[Slug:]
Reflecting what's observed
Deep, straight, and every curve

[Alias:]
Swerve and meant to contend with four with life form purposes served

[Sole:]
I put my greatest foot into the ice cold pool

[Doseone:]
And roll off the most intense of steps been ever...

[All:]
The rebels, leviathin, risen, prominence
Wet stone, monolith, drinking, continence

[Doseone:]
And the unanimous, smells leaking definitely
Is sour of audience, captive, isn’t it
The end and the all-muddied, that’s our humble home
“you” is a soaked in yes...

[All:]
Release, niagara, anxious, fragments
Pause, deep puddle dynamics

[Sole:]
We, an arched antartical snow ball, falling through the deserts

[Doseone:]
Set sensitive, a fluid too present for dense

[Slug:]
I see numerous seeds free-floating upon the chemistry

[Alias:]
Evaporation is non-existence in this conglomerate form by energy

[Slug:]
The dawn contorts the destiny, pathway unpredictable
Ripples hold the visions, a chisel in it now positions...

[Alias:]
Visions waving and squiggling constantly moving hard to realize my eyes
Ears in listening are tools for saving you from your intelligence demise

[Hook by Slug:]

[Alias:]
Do you understand the presentation of, dynamics
Do you understand the innovation of dynamics...

[Sole:]
I’m in love with a flying mermaid, she brings me glass of air and plates
Sings me songs of how we used to love concrete
All my dreams are coral reefs, and my love is a tree
And we view shattered moon like chattering
Of all the things we (gonna) wanta (oughta) be

[Doseone:]
My sweet sound safe cab beauty is far up longing stare at the determined mariner

[Alias:]
Navigating through those debating our interest value
Envisioning a reach to arrive on an island where anxious waiters fill the beach...

[Slug:]
Surfacing for breath, inhale, and then return to the depths
Submerged in the verses where the worth is kept

[Sole:]
Viceless, exotic, exciting 'til we evaporate
Draw my mass upon your peninsula, aquatic colors to illustrate...

[Doseone:]
The sailing power set within a siren stone...

[Alias:]
Longing to reach the shore, engulf themselves in music free of pours of midian...

[Slug:]
My word is my springboard
Wearing my water wings for, the dive...

[Sole:]
And i slit my throat for gills in the event I gotta survive...

[Doseone:]
We are the raft, the bank, the drift, the kelp
The 40,000 leagues of inspiration treasured never discovered

[Alias:]
Untouched by timeless traveling, amoebas see the crest overbearing
No sea-faring individuals are present in my crowd staring...

[Slug:]
Standing, fathoming the distance, between the existing rationalizations
Against the average pistons fascinations
It’s handheld, however as hard as the waves break
It would take eight hands to craft the puzzle of the puddle’s sake

[Hook by Slug:]

[Alias:]
Do you understand the presentation of, dynamics
Do you understand the innovation of dynamics...

[Sole:]
Were all having fun, laying in the moss
Layed down the tower, before we all trip
One finger, two finger, three finger pregnant...

[All:]
Row row row your reel, gently down the stream
Merrily merrily merrily merrily, life is but a sinking feeling...
