[ Verse 1: Doseone ]

I rolled up in a haterskin jacket
With a matching haterskin hat
Ooh, I made him a tenement kid
And then played him straight out the live trap
Watch it bleed and believe in my nature like that
I do decree I'll do me and we'll leave it at rap
Really ain't ready
To recognize me as most deadly to ever do every
Oo,h you know me, I ain't ever been trendy
Boy, I brought a good ax
Right at a forest of facts
Just bring me that stack
Do what I meant or get done where I'm at
Always on cue when I build with whatever I'm using
Beware you a winner who too used to losing
This make me the dangerous snake venom yet
Kind of poison that enter your ankle and reaches your neck
I am an honorable death and depression, I press
The harder I are, the hater they get
You know where you are, you maded your bed
Now sit in it, dwindle, belittle and get on the 'net
What puppet kid got to say about life to the marionette?
Nothing but fuck your assumption the rotten don't suffer
The sheep ?
A series of seconds at last
I know then I guess and you gasp
I don't need it in cursive with pencil and pen
Mine is the kind that you go with the color within
That you open it up and you win
I'm ugly and under the skin
I'm running a ton of ? government
? whoever you are

Catch 'em, drop 'em
Bottom-feed 'em
Let 'em be or set 'em free
And I don't give a fuck who see 'em
Now I'm hatable

[ Verse 2: Mestizo ]

I don't care about your bread
Let's have a little feast upon your meat
I don't care if you was dead
You can rest in peace upon the street
Better put the burners on your leg
Better put the wheels upon your feet
That'll be your turn to face death
I'm disconcerned with your belief
?[no chance?]
? do it myself
I got the sunshine upon my back
And I got the earth under my heel
For real, ?
[live forever?]
I say my prayers when I ?
?
I been there, I done that
My intention's to run that
I says that, I does that
I been that, I was that
?
My skin ?
This shit here's a grudge match
No fear where my love's at
?
Give it all, I'm taking off
Haters on me, I shake it off
They ain't got no faith at all
Take the ground and make 'em take it off
I say goodbye so I can save my soul
When they let it slide, I take control
