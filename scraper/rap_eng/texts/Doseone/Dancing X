The only dance I know is debt…

Do you know
All the words To tomorrow
Do you know
Every last paragraph to how I feel…
Lets say I don’t lie to you
But, do you lie to you…
I’d keep anything you give me
Stab wound even I’d be careful
With a key carved from any part of you…

You can dance your head at death
You can dance down your monument to death
You can dance dance dance miss
You can widdle down your monument
To a thimble and sip milk from it…

Gimme an N
Gimme an O
Gimme an A
Gimme an N
Gimme an G
Gimme an E
Gimme an L
What are you then…

A name in Nagasaki on a bad day…
You can't control the frozen no fucking way
They say, you can't betroth the frozen…
No way…

Even if I give her a vital organ in a jewelry box
With the truth on top…

You can dance your head at death
You can dance down your monument to death
You can dance dance dance miss
You can widdle down your monument
To a thimble and sip milk from it…

And then injured boyfriends everywhere…
You are no loss to the angel ranks
No tear in the space time continuum
No poison not drank
No cap stone slave driven up a pyramid’s planks…
