Your calling matters not, to all things
That can’t withstand a single story falling
Or text book mauling
Or long talks about themselves and the egalitarian
Gross sprawl of all faults and hells
They live in…they them this it…
On and on and on eclipse…with no kids, and I don’t know where rent is…
And if things don’t get less armagedon like
You’ll be forced to eat your only friend tonight
It’s broader, than you are un-wed
Like all them friends you’ve had for ten
And still don’t know you yet…
Like a death threat etched on a fabrige egg…
I am so not in love with this shit
All us symetrical cysts, respectively killing to live
All off of largely eachother, and what if’s…
When asked, how we’ll roll
Without our heart and sole
They’ll be told…
Hard as shhhhh…
That’s how its always been
We ants get backs until they quit…
P.S. In jeff, shaun, branden, bren, dave, and john I trust…
