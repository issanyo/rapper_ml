The owl quietly kills
A farmer he milks
All stone’s of significant size stand perfectly still…
While you carve hearts to life
But that’s no tree
And that no lovers knife
Meanwhile
These fly’s survive a thousand you’s and I’s
In the single day they get to both
Live and let die…
I didn’t axe
But I been explained to by both
Elder and pied pipe alike…
But they both can't warn me of themselves
Nor protect a blackhole from a white blood cell
You can t protect a convict from his baby pictures
Earth is a close collide of all possible perfects ,survived…
No god or odds perfect…
The shark, now that’s purpose
