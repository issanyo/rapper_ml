[Verse 1: Doseone and Why?]
Wingless wasp, the velvet ant
The cow on slanted land settles
To the lower most corner of the pen
Chicken wire and it's either side imprisonment
And the windows all stacked up
Under the farm barn awning

[Hook: Doseone and Why?]
A rattle snake caught in a wheel well
Strawberry in an ostrich throat

[Verse 2: Doseone and Why?]
Two small girls and a handful of dressed men
They walk a cage full of goats across the b-ball court
Goats with the rectangled eyes
With the rectangled iris

People are aborting, full grown goats

[Hook: Doseone and Why?]

All this and more at a pyramidi video shoot
