[Verse 1]
Throwing pennies on the pedestal
Where heads once rolled…
Are you with wish
Or paying for every execution
You have ever missed
In that former life…

[Chorus]
In that former life…
Were you the committed type
Never missed a hanging
In that former life…
Were you the committed type
Never missed a hanging
Humanity tangling in you enjoying your angering

[Verse 2]
Some children simply keep the taste
It could be the removal of a grandfather from his place
In photographs
A pet slew by the length of a vacation
Either way…

[Verse 3]
It’s laughter cut
With fear and doubt
From here on here, and here all out…
By, by, by the way
As it’s language staircase’s creek
Across all birthday’s do eat…
By, by, by the way

[Chorus]
