(Very much a work in progress, lots of stuff missing and lots of possible inaccuracies)

[Verse 1 - Doseone]
Rain walker, cold shoulder, veins in my raps
Maimed half a life over, soldier of strap
With a spit weapon shipwreck and slit neck
And fist-feck on solemn little island aligned with the moon
When you've seen death
On me like sheets of teeth in a (?[thing-mat?])
Don't eat the ground meat, you don't wanna try me
I'm poisonous, unemployed and deadly
{?}And you bring my...??? [?]
I need a rapper that want his face ate off tonight
I’m gonna pry, dry carve the inside out of your windpipe
[...proud???]
[...key/honor???]
Now you been took down
By the realest fearless peerless severe being ever to growl
I want what them animals got
Wanna fill a sac with venom when I fear you not
Ya got caught
By the kind of trap that don't give your friend's leg or hands back
Suck it up, smile from your shit ass
Don't want no fancy king chair and hat black
None of that, just your severed head in my lap
As I return to where I never sat
Get it? Call mine the first time
These tight beast rhymes
I destroy, I refine, no crown king

[Chorus - Doseone]
I'm sicked, if it cures even the slightest bitch
Woman you have gotta wait
I'm doin' it for the kids
I'm doin' it
You were wrecked
I'm set
I'm made in blood
Because because I is a pill that only kills
Who don’t deserve to live

[Verse 2 - Mestizo]
Write an answer make fire
Huntin' heads I want scalpin'
When the day’s done and the sun’s blazing
Playing games align their mouth
From the pig skin mount the pig head
I’m gonna dig depths with my dick wet
Gonna dive into the violence
Bring life to silence bright red
Cure the demon's fever
Several feelings of devilish
Feelings I remember every enemy
I ain’t afraid to kill a man
Die, die, I got by
You don’t wanna try me
I’m foolin', man
Let those who thug run into me
I'm a feastin' beast with sharpest teeth
Broaden my reach I'll domineer
Kinda cock-eared it before it falls to pieces
Polish my kingdom with the skin of my enemies
With the blood at my feet, no love to preach the creature
(?) ...in my heart
No architect of slick silk
Cotton con artist, trying to call for refuge
?
But they still just disappear
?
I’m still standing here
In marvelous fashion
I call to faith
These pioneers who reach flawless depths
Got loyalty in my face
They travel by day

[Chorus - Doseone & Mestizo]
I'm sicked, if it cures even the slightest bitch
Woman you have gotta wait
I'm doin' it for the kids
I'm doin' it
You were wrecked
I'm set
I'm made in blood
Because because I is a pill that only kills
Who don’t deserve to live
I'm sicked, if it cures even the slightest bitch
Woman you have gotta wait
I'm doin' it for the kids
I'm doin' it
You were wrecked
I'm set
I'm made in blood
Because because I is a pill that only kills
Who don’t deserve to live
