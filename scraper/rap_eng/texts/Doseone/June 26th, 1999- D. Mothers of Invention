[Doseone]
For the sum of us
It’s completion, loaded myself in the walk way
Scratching out, walk ‘way
Deals like problems with the pots inside the phone
Hand the liar’s block
Coming down with the deals, girls (for once!)
Rip some texture out of me, [into me] small world
Rip into me if you more [caps] and one last
Question that’s all I need
Go buy a fresh stem and issue, open end
A moon boot tire survived earthling
(Heave!) Cracks in the headphones and the scalp
[Cants and should not who just wasted ink]
(Left it, left it) Colours within, colours within
[I’ll see said the plum and] curtsy bow
He bowed on his birthday
Moon against his own questions anyone skeleton
(Skeleton key!) key period open

[Hook: Alias, Slug, & Sole]
Walking through the rain and the millennium
Where lazy and convenient is the mother of invention
I must have the guts to mention to that man in that reflection
(What are you looking at?)

[Sole]
So it’s been a minute
And I’ve grown fond of this outfit
Gotta escape the lone we keep on the
Deep end we depend upon to
Continue to struggle, to bond
Connecting thoughts, thoughts in
Spare time, I’m a reoccurring theme (remember me?)
How soon they forget, I ain’t seen lanterns
I developed the ability to rise
Now I own all the shadows and reflect off everything
Sold the bullet-proof vest 'cause they stuck [dumb and]
Forgot how to propel, to move each other to
Move bodies of water
[All the] scared to crack the surface
But what I give is distorted
And carry to bury
Brought back to life  the sandcastle
Nothing lasts, beauty is what you make it
Until the waves of wind and people ruin
What I’ve worked so very hard to preserve

[Hook]

[Slug]
And when the sun looks at me, I feel alright
But ain’t nothing but a moment before it turns away
The humidity trip me off of my feet last night
When I looked up I saw that I had nothing to say
I think I’d like people more if they’d think more like me
So quietly I wait for my inner revolution
When the eagle can soar forward toward the sea
I’ll aim at the beast in the name of retribution
Now I’m lookin’ down the barrel of a gun
Son of a gun, son of a Sam, son of the man
Who was a brother to Sam and if they see
My shadow they should run, 'cause I won’t
Halt 'til I’m done, spreadin’ all my salt across the land

As a child I was afraid of the storm, but now I welcome the rain
