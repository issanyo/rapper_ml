A group of not-yet-gorgeous girls
Watching a boy follow his own scent
Then their body the poor boy, then he picks up some rope
Then they body and body at the rope, then they body the boy

Child chest bending pulling at decomposed ship
From its deep sea sheath anchor eye thread
By the length of his arm
His puberty-struck head of hair
Growing black as the ribs on the rex wheel
In the new century sun

Free fish and blanket pulling forth on abandoning ship
Muscles letting go at the strain on the face
Mirror-clad crowds beginning to gather behind the wet shirt
Hid wife made of the sun becoming mother
They drug an entire armada from the first on the ocean
Most of them simply stood behind him shooting like mad
Their film over-exposed

Five feet, the sound soft, breaking your neck (bringing an egg?)
Ocean asking yourselves where they've been, what it's like
