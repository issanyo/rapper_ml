K-E-E-P F-A-L-L-I-N-G
Keep trying
To dig the sun it’s grave
While I grow
The goals of a slave
These machines and simpler pimps don’t need you
Won’t haunt you
And just might eat you
Like any girl, shrink, shark, art, dark, heart, marked start will do..
To you, and whom…ever you choose…
I wanna fall, till I forget on a field of blooming knives
And I de-scar, and fall till I forget what baseball cards are…
Who is your inspiration, a girl or just another god
Some dead philosopher you don't got
What you got?
You got a she you can K-E-E-P…
No… but I am believed…
Keep trying to dig the sun its grave
With a shovel or substance
To light up the coal that you love with
Or do I only describe my own numbness…
Keep trying to dig the sun its grave
With your ice
Your ice all over me
And This chest full of ice
Is so not tight
