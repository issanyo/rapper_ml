By BEHOLSTER eye, DRAGUN tooth
GUNGEON wind do whisper one truth
Body the floor, Bullet through roof
Ammo willing, past killing, gun shall shoot

Non stop hammer cock
Violent mannered shots land a lot
Keep cannnon hot, can it not cease
Granted rot peace rest handed
Got beast, best last man standin
Gun speak, fleece BOSS head handed

He gun'd it up GUNGEON down
She gun'd it up GUNGEON down
We gun'd it up GUNGEON down

Dead Em and Down
I'm choppin round after round after round...

ENTER THE GUNGEON
Gun'd it up GUNGEON down

Death down barrel at you only once wink
Blur gone bullets life at brink in a blink
Caseing killing floor clink
Fought BOSS blood drink
To wired to die
To under fire to think
