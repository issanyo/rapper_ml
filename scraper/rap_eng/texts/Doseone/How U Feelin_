"And they drove him there
Like a key to a skeptic
When the bills start nibbling through the door
And whoa, whoa, whoa they're gone..."

Won't you come in and let's get started
This angel's fallen, so heed my calling
The wheels are rolling, the tension's growing
So join our reverie, walk into heaven

We're driving Lamborghinis and we're sipping on martinis
We're slurping on linguinis but we're spying on bikinis
We're sowing what we're reaping and we're here to sell you freedom
Apocalypse is nearing, won't you tell me how you're feeling?

(rap)

Driving Lamborghinis and we're sipping on martinis
With caviar and blinis but we're spying on bikinis
And if that isn't good enough, we're here to set you free
Apocalypse is nearing, won't you tell me how your feeling?

Apocalypse is nearing
So tell me how you feeling
Yeah, I can hear you screaming
But tell me how you feeling?
Apocalypse is nearing
So tell me how you feeling
You're kicking and screaming
But tell me how you feeling?

Kicking the cloud ... and the rain is pouring
And I don't know what's worse
Sitting here or at the back of the hearse
Upon accused
... pigeons summon
The gods are killing the...
...if I'm the chosen one
I wasn't chosen for this...
And my condolences, son
This ain't fun for anyone
Please ignore the pain and say amen
