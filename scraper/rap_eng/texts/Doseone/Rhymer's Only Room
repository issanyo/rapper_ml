Rhymer's only room;
Cincinnati lone lie tomb
Hiding under the ceiling over a cold skull winter bed spread
Rhymer's only room;
Sweet smelling walk into cartoons
Hiding in the seawee on the sea bed breath bloating welter weight land legs
Rhymer's only room;
Still sugar man to the hight school crew
Hiding a garage full of let go balloon from the sky
Rhymer's only room;
Cincinnati lone lie tomb
