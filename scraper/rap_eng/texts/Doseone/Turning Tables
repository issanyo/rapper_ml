[Mestizo]

I make moves toward city landscapes
Standing skyscraper high
Doing donuts in the parking lot
While most are scraping by
Yakkin' bout words
They empty vision won't recognize
It's death to the layman's mind
Complexedly taken lines
With both knives I'm 'bout to raise up
Won't stop til squadron pays up
Won't stop to apologize
To souls made of lies
(?)
Y'all wannabes be comedy
I'm baggin' up and taggin' this
Beggin' to be legend at the expense of another
Veteran, but it's best to just let it be
And let the paedophiles fuck eachother
Til they deaded from disease
So grip the hammer and I'm the anvil up in this seige
Cuz evil feeds off evil deeds
So I'll just exercise
The index, and squeeze it til it bleeds
Until it leads and mine get ease
And kills off all lies

I-N-E-M-P-T-Y-I-T-R-U-S-T
I live off whatever there is where it's deep
Ain't no heartbeat the teethpart I won't eat
But I'd rather starve some
Than low-hung insect-infested fruit feast
With the sick-fetus we-tweet-penis sheep
Who leak blood when they sleep-- or don't

Speak while I'm deciding if you're fake or not, reef
The writing says 'he failed a lot'
Mister basecamp talk tall of all the mountaintops
I truly do believe you not
Better cross T, I P Q [eye peek you]
With i to dot by speck of blood
Disconnect a thug from his violent act
By stressing what his raps and child inside him lack
I have a knack for that
Part man, part shark, part art, part axe
All will and wild, in a whiteboy body trapped
I'll pull your severed head out of your favorite hat
Drop the head and wear the hat
I'm fucking invisible mean mic magic like that

Point being
So many so-called word-edged warriors
Are more highly-absorbent foragers
Jackal with a laptop
Hyena with a high-speed internet connect
Dot-come-for-it-anywhere
You only put a rap where you would put your neck
I'm lightning striking through out a throat up out a chest
Rawest rapper you never met
With or without your respect

Shout out to death
