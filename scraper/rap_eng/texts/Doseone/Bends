What
Exactly do you not understand about the blues
What
About crossroads ain’t 1 plus 2 for dear you
Or dare you…
Crawl under your skin
Into the absence of a police that patrol your with in
This is an end
And I know who I am
What my strengths can and can't bend
When its bill bill pay
And your in a deadly way
Say like prey all fit to be flayed
Not knowing you will slave another day
Bones break
Pipes sing
Boys will wonder
Men hunger…
And loss is a motherfucker
I know a fool
Like your demo knows you
This the sleep tight that fights the red need in your rest
The bandaged tins of your heart that a full tour tests
This the solemn s.o.s. I send unto the depths of situations strength won’t bend
And best friends can't mend with pure truths, favorite foods, or assassination of an x
Oh I know, this shit is pleasure and death
Like modern day sex
And you stay weak in the skins of your dick
And the thins of your thicks
And I know this world will kill
And beg
We go together like guns and heads…
These child proof bullets won't kill you
These child like women won't feel you
