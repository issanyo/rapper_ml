(I Remember . . .)
I met it first when I was a much younger cannibal
In a toystore, where I wanted a robot that became an animal
Back when I was between moms
Long before I learned how to song
(Greed, gonna lick around your wound and make it worse)
When I act G-R-double-E-to-the-D, my sides hurt
That's how I know I am remotely good or worse
That, and cuz I buy other bands' teeshirts

When I first made (Vile Gluttons)
Well, that just had to be done
Not work earned, not fun
But I loved who it got to and where it was from
I don't know no more
This ain't then, I ain't Them
We ain't no more old friends
Sometimes wounds fight mends

I'd imagine but not make pretend
(I still believe in something)
Just don't care if there's industry around it
No church and cross
Work and boss
On tour, off
Eat a book, eat a dick, eat sphinx, eat the rich
But know that you can't
(Greed gets around your mouth)
Like refined taste, but it ain't
Like a delicacy's taste, but it ain't

No pre-glow neither low
Weak deeps keep wheat growing
Out a season no--
(Tigers die)
. . .wh--what the fuck was that?
(Tigers die)
No pre-glow neither low
Weak deeps keep wheat growing
Out a season no eatin'
Whole stem and core
Evermore most least
Live love need mud feed seed
And a beautiful--
And a beautiful--

Tigers die and show viable signs of depression when caged
I sleep like shit between drugs
And approximate face of he who not fazed
(x2)

Sometimes, I look at an album
And I can hear it play
Sometimes, I look at an album
And regret a small mountain of debt
And I'll be damned if I've got a wish fountain to pay

I'm already a mess of will, weed, want, need, expectation and day
But hey
(You pray?)
Who, me?  Heh, nah
But somehow still
I still bang big belief, yes indeed
