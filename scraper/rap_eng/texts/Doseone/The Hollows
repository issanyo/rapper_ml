[Verse 1: Yoni Wolf]
As I lay me down to fall asleep
With my demons dying
And my pilot light weak
I curse the last six months
I've been hiding behind a mustache
Yeah
And to those last 10 years
I've been howling a paper moon
Well fuck you

[Chorus 1: Yoni Wolf & Doseone]
This goes out to all my underdone
Other-tongued
Lung-long frontmen
(This is what the ghost of someone's dad says)
And all us earth growths
Some planted
And some pulled
(Shut up and put your money where your mouth is)

[Verse 2: Yoni Wolf]
You shine a flashlight in
A hat box and spin
An empty oyster shell
And celebrate the hollows

[Chorus 2: Yoni Wolf & Doseone]
This goes out to dirty-dancing, cursing
Back-masking, back-slidden pastor's kids
(From behind bars its not so hard to see he's risen)
And all us earth growths
Some planted
And some pulled
(Nobody finds god and then goes to prison)

[Verse 3: Yoni Wolf]
In Berlin I saw two men fuck
In the dark corner of a basketball court
Just a slight jingle
Of pocket change pulsing
In the tourist park I lost 50 euros
To a guy with the walnut shells
And the marble
It really pissed me off
So I thought I'd go back
To get my money
But all my homies warned me
"Oh no, those gypsies
Prolly got knives"

[Chorus 3: Yoni Wolf & Doseone]
This goes out to all my under-brewed
Double-duped, two-time truth-fools
(Stop thinking a phone call
Or text is too complicated)
And all us earth growths
Some planted
(Like a married uncle at a family function)
And some pulled

[Bridge: Yoni Wolf]
I got them shaky gums and a couple of loose tooths
Now tell me what should I do?
My God, the clock's always
Stuck tellin' 11:11, at 3:32

[Chorus 1: Yoni Wolf & Doseone]
Even just Joanna Newsom's left hand
(I could beat the pants in bass off your best man)

[Chorus 1: Yoni Wolf & Doseone]
(This is what the ghost of someone's dad says)
And all us earth growths
Doin' the croak
Like it ain't no joke

[Outro]
In a crowded room projected debonair
Aloof impermanence
He shrouded loosely
In a heavy air of indeterminance
