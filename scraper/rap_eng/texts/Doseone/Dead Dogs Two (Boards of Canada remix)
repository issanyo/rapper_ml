From the height of the highway on-ramp we saw
Two dogs dead in a field
Glowing on the Oakland Coliseum green seats wasteland
Dogs â€“ dogs we thought were dead

They rose up, rose up when whistled at
Their rib cage inflating
Like men on the beach being photographed
A guard dog (guard dog) for what? (for what?)
Against overzealous penniless athletics fanatics
Getting into games through a hole in the fence

For the owner of the blue tarp tent
Pitched by a creek beneath the on-ramp
In the privacy of the last three
Skin-and-bony trees, devoid of leaves
And us undeceased, with our new CDs
Zipping on dead east, Oakland

It's hard to stand the sight of two dogs dead
Under a sky so blue
You have to stop the blood to your head
To fit the breath in front of you

It's hard to stand the sight of two dogs dead
Under a sky so blue
You have to stop the blood to your head
To fit the breath in front of you

We secretly long to be some part of a car crash
I long to see your arms stripped to the tendons
The nudity of swelling exposed vein
Webbing the back of your hand
To be a red-tendoned dog
To be red-tendoned dogs
Blood breathing by the side of the highway

I long to be dead
Center of a curious crowd
To be touched
Sticky like nearly dried paint
Their soft silent stare, nursing your face
Anticipating the slightest pinch I flinch of pain
Everyone blank in accident-awe
As the car crash fiberglass dust
Straight up settles on your raw muscle tissue

It's hard to stand the sight of two dogs dead
Under a sky so blue
You have to stop the blood to your head
To fit the breath in front of you

It's hard to stand the sight of two dogs dead
Under a sky so blue
You have to stop the blood to your head
To fit the breath in front of you

To be red-tendoned dogs
To be red-tendoned dogs
To be red-tendoned dogs
To be red-tendoned dogs
To be dead center of a curious crowd

To be red-tendoned dogs
To be red-tendoned dogs
To be red-tendoned dogs
To be red-tendoned dogs
