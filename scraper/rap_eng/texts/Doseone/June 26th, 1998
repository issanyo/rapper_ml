[Alias]
I’ve been let down, ungently
Left to ponder what’s taken place

[Slug]
I repair my keep starin’ at his small sleepin’ face

[Sole]
Everything’s a phase and I’ve come such a long way

[Doseone]
I’ve given all to appease
And I've owned enough hell to pay

[Alias]
Strategy is my biggest tool in
This universal tournament

[Slug]
(Verse lives) inducing turbulence
To touch my pertinence

[Sole]
It’s all so enlightening
It always above

[Doseone]
The ultimate prevail, [valianese] of a moment
Forces interlocking fusing ethereal motion

[Sole]
Life is but a deal, so many noble notions

[Slug]
Good breakfast, make a checklist
Alphabetize my records

[Alias]
All this struggling that I endure has made my back and neck hurt

[Doseone]
That slab of worms and roots we rape to rot in

[Sole]
It wasn’t my fault, I thought
And thought, yet it’s taunt…

[Slug]
Expand through the stages, everyday’s a knew planet

[Alias]
But still flew uncompletion after I run the gamut

[Hook by Sole]
Nature, health, knowledge, success
Woman, man, trust, progress
Culture, frailty, healing, destiny
Endurance, family, science, society
The music, the soul, healing, [lyin’…]
Health, security, drugs, time…
Trials, hunt, advanced, innocence
Smiles, love, chance, relevance

(Doseone/All: What is the meaning of life?) [among other lyrics bleeding in]

[Alias]
Commission myself to a cause, but of course
I want some exchange, the sun dying feeling
Is the strongest in my emotion range

[Slug]
Passion position it, now hunger
For the kisses, convulsing
Lusting, clutch me, hold me
Touch me, thrusting, thrusting

[Sole]
We all [pause] at my anger, grutted and gritted
As we rummage in the aftermath, we attain nothing that we wanted

[Doseone]
Easy is chosen, but “hard is to ground” understood
Drawing a front line thin between mustn’t and should

[Alias]
At ease, no worrying scurrying around to accomplish
That’s all taken care of, relax, no need to ask

[Slug]
It hurts so good, misunderstood
I wouldn’t leave it even, even when I wish that I could

[Sole]
And from here all is clear
Playthings become anew, I knew it all
I always thought beyond my imagination
My perception’s a misleading tool

[Doseone]
Of gravity, of relativity, of no accord
An earthly genuine attempt to clone what is formed

[Alias]
What it’s beholding moulding, constantly expanding
And constructing, there’s no foreseen or happening
Obstructing

[Doseone]
The pure reason random beyond results
Always shaping or happened, it’s fates only [in sold]

[Slug]
Voice gang rape by talent medium in question
Impregnated by all three of 'em, invade expression

[Sole]
We’ll just take a cylinder to symbolise
The presence of no presence, hollow in courage
Shake in the space of it’s worthlessness

[Doseone]
A slow gather of scars peddles and appearances
As a firm grasp becomes one composite experience

[Sole]
From oil and sludge, a new shadow strikes the planets
In the beginning there was darkness, womanness and mannish

[Slug]
All the way to, up, up and away to
Take the steps through the gate that
Separates the garden from the snakes

[Alias]
Open my information highway to intake
To fill this puddle for us swelling
Transition to a lake

[Doseone]
… Wrinkle of energy from empty
A duty, weathering the damage to fix [(a kiss)]

[Sole]
This is why I’m here, where are my trophies?
Give me back my land and heart and family
Man, I’m parched

[Slug]
What you need, identical to what I hold above your head
Take heed, read my gospel, memorize all that I said

[Alias]
Next, make it better than the last was built
Next, do it again this time, looking
That which you were dealt

[Chant by Sole]
Nature, health, knowledge, success

Trials, hunt, advanced, innocence
Smiles, love, chance, relevance
