[Verse 1: Doseone]
Maybe by bagful of jackals
Necking a hug of rope
By sober trained cobra
Stoned with artisinal soap
Down here anything floats
Say the truth to the guts where memory chains them
You prove what you must, projecting balance on mayhem
And keeping it up all the toil and toothbrushing of dust
Off of giving a fuck it must take
Yet choice is confined to life
A mistake your corpse wonâ€™t make
I've got 99 problems
But my corpse got none
Let me stop your cadaver
Completely free of clock
Death the only place
Capitalism is not
Look at you!
One palm tree free
Wild isle in a sea of rot
The tide taking grain by grain
Drop by drop
You forgot how far from the food chain you did drop
I got 99 problems but (inhales) let me stop
Unhand the candle
Let the wolves of wind get it
Who warned me of darkness
My inner sun setted long time ago
Shout out to all stock-to-the-live
With that certain-doom all-food-gotta-die
Conveyer-belt-to-consume
Bona-fide utterly fireless look to they eye
I'm guaranteed each day of perfecting my delicate mess
And fulfilled by the fact that I am killing my death
Yet reassured that hell ain't filled yet
I play every single morning roulette
Dark Cloud
It's connected to the head
It's connected to the bones
It's connected to the chest
He throw whole body on a guess this is not a test
I repeat, this is not a corpse
It pitched no torch, it dripped, it scorched
This while it fought
[?] just that I don't care what you feel
As long as you feel something
Cadalack Ron Paul King!
Rest powerful Valhalla heart, meet your mark, perfect shot, time
Let's go!

[Bridge]
No no no, no no
It's all good, it's all good
You're all good Ron, don't change, you're good
OK, like, I don't know what to believe any more
Except, I don't believe anybody
I don't trust anybody

[Verse 2: Mestizo]
Now this is
Blood for blood shed
Double when the thug's dead
You come around here suspect, best believe I'm serving justice
Got consequence to come [?]
No backpedaling for once
Now what's that you say?
You haven't made good on your debt you've got cash to pay
Well heavens that's a bad habit for a man to procrastinate
[????] you can catch a fade
If we can all unmask in this masquerade
Well hang 'em over telephone wires with a pair of [?]
Rest in power!
