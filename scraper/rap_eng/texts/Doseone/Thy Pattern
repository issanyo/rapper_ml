[Verse 1: Doseone]

And when I
Slept
You'd knead
Glue into my wings
Tie rocks across my eyes
And stab for from where I sing
And I
Would not pretend to mourn your death
I'd honestly probably solemnly
Just tell Jeff
I could explain all sorts of numb but this ain't no wound-licking tongue
I could explain all sorts of numb but this ain't no wound-licking tongue
I keep trying
To finish writing (This line)
About women hiding [(?)]
(Jump)
You want to complain but your
(numb)
I ain't no settler
Not a girl in her
Twenties
Knows what the fuck she requires
I ain't no settler
Nay not met
A girl in her
Twenties
Who knows what she wants
I could explain all sorts of numb but this ain't no wound-licking tongue
I could explain all sorts of numb but this ain't no wound-licking tongue
[?]
I can tie the stem of a rose with my tounge
And the rows of my teeth
And woe that i reap
[?]
Its my pattern
I give it up
I give it up
I give it up
I give it up
Its my pattern
