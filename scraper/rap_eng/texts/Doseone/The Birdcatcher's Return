Don't be embarased...
Sit in the cross walk...
He puts the "view finder" down...
Just keep saying to yourself...
"i can't get lost i don't know where i am..."
Our famed bird catcher is having a half zen moment
In which he misses his parents and needs to find his own damn
Cave virtually...simultaneously...
Well here it is

Trombone and all of which found him funny...
So the last bird he never caught got him a tony and cured his
Athlete's foot...to mystery and the boat docks...
Where something else might strike me as circular...
