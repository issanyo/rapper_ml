[Verse - 1]
Get money, chicka chicka ching, chicka chicka ching
Look not in﻿ wallet nor purse but purse
Some kids I shouldn't even be going through this except it seems
The clueless have taken it upon their shrewdness or lack there of
To brewed some blind love for their oppressor/molester
With his blood green complexion yet according to my comprehension
Cold hard cash is devoid of any affection so with no
Heart no racial preference
It fucks us﻿ all up, the narrow shaft of our essence
While we buy pillows cold sweatin
Dreaming of the world liquidated, laying and infatuated
And been fornicated orifice sedated by its own promiscuous behavior
Then inseminated by paper thin savior
Which whispered swift and seductive promises of happiness and bliss
Only if youve ever spawned upon thine hips and I ask you this
How can any being of want resist, thus with minds and money clips all embellishing its need
Allowing the young seed to subsist placing the warm breast to its lips shameful how now the need shifts
As you gleefully submit to motherly lusts and﻿ passionate fits of a hormonal monetary imba lance
And with one good reflective glimpse its obvious youve been short changed
On half wits but your quite contrite frivolous bitch
Alas quicker than quick, bestower﻿ of birth sits perishable nurse made enslaved and whipped
Stuck disposing of this filthy la vas piss and shit
Desperately hoping with such acts of piousness, you could, one day could
Be coddled in the mists of its empty embrace your local US mint deemed grace

[Hook]

Paying a penny for your thoughts and selling that soul for nothing fucking vile gluttons (x2)

[Verse - 2]
Dirty little thing ain't it, for such a small scrap of parchment
Tainted, my hopes run dry, indelible dime
Im a 6.6.6.5, which is probably contrived of human hair
A pinch of despair in fetal pigs eyes
Still in Gods trust we're mesmerized and directly besides our
Once prized lives we stack time Georgian E top lives
Never the less as much as mans surprise always banking on pains
Always got evolution looking like small change
While our small brains have grown financially deranged with
Crisis common sense greedily exchanged for the cold copper con
Strange how desire devours the mind, shame on our want
And little kind, you get a bottle of liquor and time, until
Its all polished off, then we shine, selfishly sentimental or
Consequential, rushes unconscious impassioned plushest
Dreamed of precious metals and sluts with beckoning labium
And glistening breasts heaving in sultry sweats, smears the eagles
Crest thinked in hot sex upon their chest, so uninhibited
And addressed in mid climax you wake up lucid mess and firmly
Press that hard dick into the matress(t) sending it drift and pulpous ecstasy
Completely content to lay dormant, with those plushy mitts affectionately backed about one last red scent

[Hook]
Keep paying a penny for your thoughts and selling that soul for nothing, fucking vile gluttons (x3)

It's in the pockets not the soul weigh it, break out your scales of self, analyze, look at yourself, look at your eyes
Not your accounts and set worths its inner, enjoy
