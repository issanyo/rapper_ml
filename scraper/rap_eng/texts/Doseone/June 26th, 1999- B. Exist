Who's lost and who's the boss?
How'd his head get chewed off?
Open your mouth, spit it out
Move ain't enough for tryin' to lift the crowd
I missed the bus but i caught the flight
Mischievous and it cost my life
Atop the bridge, count the cars below
Wishing time would slow so i could stop to go
Leaning to the sides and making the turn again
I'm learning the turns and i'm familiar with the terms
Tryin' to shed light with the songs i write
But the lights require fire now i'm covered with burns
Seventh degree, put my flesh in the heat
Too much adrenaline for just lettin' it be
Sometimes i wish that they would leave me dead in the streets
But i feel like half a human when i'm restin' my feet

I don't know, that huge thing sure is a long ways off

[Alias]
And my strength is quickly reducing

[Dose]
What if by chance we got lost?

[Alias]
That's a good point, that has also passed through my head

[Dose]
Big belly river, ocean wide, that it is a lot bigger than me
Ooooh, i shudder at the thought

[Alias]
And i'm painfully aware of opinions playing a big role
Wishing i could release myself from this depressing strangle hold

Hiding almost out of breath on the other side of the lights
Fingering our belly buttons
Dreaming of the bigger things in life

Hiding out of breath on the other side of the lights
It's fingering out belly buttons
Thinking of the bigger things in life!

How god awful does this sound have to be
For me to gain a large core audience?
Plainly change is in the air
But when the spotlight is swung in my direction will anybody care?
Constantly this train runs through my head, daydreaming
My connection to it all is supported by poles
Thank god last year i invested in the spring board
It made the most important thing in one of my best friend's life
It's exactly one orbit later
And the pangs of being unsure haunt my every waking day
Am i being selfish for creating myself and friends first
And the others second? i wouldn't change it for the world
Yet i feel stuck between a rock and a three thousand mile trip
That kept getting pushed back causing more of this discussion
The art of confidence is not one of my strongest areas
And probably never will be, probably never will be

Wishful thinking at an all-time high
Kiss the demons and make 'em all cry
Standin' at the window watchin' the wind
Countin' the tears that get caught in my grin
Chewin' on the center of interest investin'
All the time and the pride that rests upon my chest
Continue gathering twigs to build my nest
Self-battlin', eatin' up epiphanies for breakfast
I went to all the parties, i met all the women
And i've stood at the center of the prism, to the left of attention
And to the right of the universe
As bad as it is, i gotta believe that it could be worse
Walkin' through the rain and the millennium
Where lazy and convenient is the mother of invention
I must have the guts to mention to the man in the reflection
Yo, what you lookin at? (what are you lookin' at?)

[dose]
Ooooh there's some climbing going on
Adam's found his courage, adam's found his courage
Open, put on display puddle perfect, open again
The happy one's a poison pen leaking all over me, all over in order
I'm rolling at this movie of a poet's wife
Staring at my belly button, thinking of the bigger things in life
Hiding almost out of breath on the other side of the lights
Little things in life, it's quiet
