(Ongoing work - A lot is missing)

[Intro]
(?)
So unnatural
(?)

[Verse 1: Mestizo]
I can't even tell you how much pain I'd done caused
From the hurt that I felt
From my veins to my jaws
Feeling chained to my flaws
Call me by my name first
That'll be your last
Face melters and heart burst
I revert to my old ways
With no hesitation
Ain't no mystery in how God works
I'm sick and in my sin
Think of it as something sacred
Only I could comprehend
And I'm buried in this hatred
And at a loss for words
Just a variation of its arrogance
Except for special little secrets I could keep to myself
Time's tickin' and alive
We did it and die with it
That the all five senses died(?)
Hell died here
Ain't no different where I live
We die of fear, I admit it
Cycles of the signs and the cycles in the silence
I’ve committed in a line with all the fires
Spin and spiral into violence
It’s a pivot, it’s a barrier to challenge
Just a perfect way to end it

[Bridge]
I call it how I see it
I walk it how I live it
I speak what I believe in
So you can say I did it

[Chorus]
No brakes (No brakes)
(?)

[Verse 2: Doseone]
Cold broad bleak
Code of streets and vows
Mona Lisa mouths
Eat the older child
Each beneath the cloud
Talking at the hound
Now I get made portion on the plate of life
Dark like (?) at the end of busy nights
On the blade of life
Like dark free clinic visit
(???)
All blade life
Surrounded by nothing but knife
All youse saw is bright
And walk the worst off
Focus sophmore loss
Much stronger cough
Clacks the clamor to the mettle of men
Unrung ladder and a gallon of wind
Warm rainwater and sun-colored skin
Don't finish fights where they don't begin
Not everything stays where it's been
I be the kind of key that let lightning in
Amongst the thunder
And a number of income-colored moons
Under them gangsta bows
Older with a wisdom to his anger
Shouldering an anchor to his language
Colder, stranger to the safe
And new danger to himself and you
Heavily tattooed IQ
From all the ugly angel-absence got him up to
And [?]
An altar of low states
It's all broke, no brakes

[Chorus]
No brakes (No brakes)
(?)
