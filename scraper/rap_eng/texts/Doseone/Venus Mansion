[Moist Mother]
Yes, yes, yes, ah!

[Verse 1: Yung Venuz]
It's the
Dead body lootin'
Mutant shootin'
Venus youthin'
Rootin' tootin'
Luger totin'
Ruger loadin'
Bullet throwin'
Way-too-long grenade holding
Triangular, might mangle your weapon to rap
Flash color-coded clips 'n' an RPG hat
Baby, baby blue ammo turns red when it claps
Shoot your face in the fat
Give your cadaver a slap
Where the level boss at?
I wanna clickclickcaclack-ch'pow-clickclickcaclack that
See 'em, shoot 'em, skin 'em, wear 'em, mount 'em on a wall
If it's completely armor plated Imma shoot it in the BALL...
...in' like a black hole or vulture flock
You're violently challenged
Your THANGS don't cock
Your things get shot
Your party stop
When I roll up teen wolfin' on an ambulance top
This ain't no game ain't never been no show
And I'll gladly gun down the oldest lady you know
