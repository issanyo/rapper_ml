Bring it
Bring your sick
And the winding of my lining
With all them cysts…
I”d rather die by oldage oldage
Or having kids…
Do forgive
But I ain’t no one death bitch…
I’d rather die by death bed, best friend
Weapon, laptop, rap rock, stop watch
Back stock, detox………
I want it…
Of the face
Of the arm
I want it…
Of brave…
Cancer come on…
I want it…
Of the hope…
Of the song…
I want it…
Of the quote
Cancer come on…
So lets say I get this sick
That’s all the rage and anthem with
These filthy rich ex-presidents
Then will they let me in the Franklin Mint…
So I might swim, in all that gold…
Till my immune system folds
One white blood cell at a time
And one by one, your health is un-done…
And I won
When I get it first
