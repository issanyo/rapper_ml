Uuh track eroticism

Why, I'm utterly disgusted
Sick to my soul, with this ignorance encrusted
Gaping hole, in the ground called Rap
I've found on the whole a functional lapse
Between what scenes sold and where I'm at
So look up, and then living confident but
By all means must stay one full dick-riding duck
An inbred two-head mutt
Away from me at all times, because I'm
Allergic to most synthetic materials you rhyme
I voice the spiritual, along the lines
Of a similar superiority principle
I could redefine until wax is pressed from swine
Or this hulking mass will gets signed
See that you posthumously shine
In fact --- shattered on some track of mine
That is, when its played backwards on 45
Then prove you're mortified
I mean, immortalized
Miscreant, you misjudged the photo size
Can't put some friends or BAM!
In the pretentious platinum highrise
So when the lust-ego-deal thing is capsized
You can count out my
Daring deeds and random acts of heroism
But that's just me, and I'm a stickler for wisdom
Or any substance of light texture, listen
Glorified heckler of a nose-bleed, heed
Your tongue or be oppressed
Imagine that much needed rest
Catch an ocean of breath
Let thoughts regress and a famished mind digest
My constructive criticism in context
