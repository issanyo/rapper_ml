So make no mistake
Mr. take, take, take
Your paperworks safe
For your fast paced gas face
It's bones being bleached
And leaved as we speak
On a cocoa sheath
On a glass bed bad dream

Cha-cha-chances a-a-are
If it's between give and take
Take, take, take
[2x]

And what does it say in the cabbed contract
About whether or not
And who is that?

He gets eaten
And then we get eaten
We, we get eaten

First
That's all subject of change
Reveal a future death
Most death, death, thoughts can access
Death, death! death
Oh a splinter, oh a nuclear winter

Cha-cha-chances a-a-are
If it's between give and take
Take, take, take
[4x]

Cha-cha-chances a-a-are
If it's between give and take
Take, take, take
[8x]
