VERSE ONE (MCskill ThaPreacha)
Armani armani, I'm sick of these rappers they talking about money

Wear fake versace,  they talking bacardi

Say that they ball but these niggas ain't kobe

You drive a buggati or drive a Toyota or drive a Mercedes or driving a skoda

None of my problems, I'm sipping my soda

Build like a mason and aim for the towers

Switch flows, make dough

Shine bright like the halo

I stayed on my grind

Lagos to London to Berlin to France, they feeling the man

Miami to Bronx, I'm racking up fans

Tokyo, Japan I'm highly in demand

Now Google the name, show me your face

And I'm raising the bar, with the pinky got brains

Hatred and envy is changing the game

But pay me my money cos that's why i came

This is my hustle, not taking this funny

Collab or a show, gotta pay me my money

They never thought about this

Me, the first 17th letter used to diss

Now we fix the beef, eat the beef in the remix

Wrath of a menace, the rise of the phoenix
