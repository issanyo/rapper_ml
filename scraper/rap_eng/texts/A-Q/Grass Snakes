{intro}
Bitches grass snakes.......
Out my mind all the way
Niggas fake , bitches grass snakes, {?}
Bitches grass snakes......
Niggas fake, bitches grass snakes
AQ NIGGA !! (Haaa)

{Chorus x3}
Niggas fake, bitches grass snakes
I'm tryna keep em out my mind all the way

{Verse 1}
I Walk up in the spot making all these niggas mad
[?] wishing and I'm getting all the things they never had
Bossed up, cashing out I'm rolling with that bag
Niggas steady hating when I see em gotta laugh
Yeah it's sad enough, the way they acting up
They not around when you down, they just scavengers
I look around at all these clowns they just acting tough
We kept the money on our mind, now you mad at us
I got a couple niggas livin` in the street life, couple other niggas
Don't know what the streets like, it make me think twice
Do more to eat right, you niggas living in the dark! But I see light

{Chorus x3}
Niggas fake, bitches grass snakes
I'm tryna  keep em out my mind all the way

{Verse 2}
AQ yeah I'm back now, dogs on attack now
You Niggas don't know what to do when that mac sound
Soldiers on the front line, but I play the background
Niggas talk that tough talk until that Nina back out
Talk this talk that you never gone scare me!
Praises to the most high, the only one I'm fearing
Break it down roll it up, yea my mind is clearing
Ain't no sharing, we rolling until our ears ring
Yea my mind is moving slow motion, we smoking on that potent
We gave your girl that potion ....
So high yea this weed got rolling...
Yea I'm floating like I'm sitting in a ocean

{Chorus x3}
