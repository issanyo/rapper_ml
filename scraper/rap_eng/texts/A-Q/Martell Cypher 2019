[Verse 1: Blaqbonez]
Blaqbonez one of the few
That's really rapping, I'll be
Handing out L's to these rappers
They know I'm snapping, you could
Take your L right off the bat
Like LL Cool J
Or somewhere in the middle
Like Samuel L Jackson yo
Getting all these accolades
Look at us, we're the winning team
Niggas talk trash, don't make us
Pull up with the magazines
Body bag them till the end of the world
I'll probably ask John Boyega
To drop em' off at the pacific rim
I'm snapping again
Starting a massive attack with the pen
I'm next to be king
Impartially ought to be sitting
But I'm waiting for M
It's cool since the crown's in the circle
No competition, where I'm chilling
It's a mountain to get to
It's like the corridors of power
In the building like that
You outside peeking, don't make me
Come to the window with a mac
Battle rappers always tryna get at me
But they missing, like literally
When we talk about money they [hmmh]
Can't really say that I'm surprised
Like for real man, I get it
The bigger the nigga
The more attention you get when you diss him
If you really wanna battle
Pay my booking fee nigga
Niggas tryna be like me
Should write a book for these niggas
Yeah, bars so dope
I'm getting high off my own supply I'm
Sniffing on my own shht
Stoned to death like I'm Goliath
Album of the year conversation
I really did it
Revenue hit a couple milli
How'd you think that I'm feeling bitch

[Verse 2: Loose Kaynon]
Huhn, how is this still a conversation
If you want the confrontation then stop talking
I'm too busy to throw stones at every dog barking
I'm home alone in this Hip-Hop shht
Macaulay Culkin
Y'all on some follow the leader shht
Quit with this talking
It's nothing, the crown is home
You bluffing so watch your tone
You're humble in person
But online you're Al-Capone
Leave me alone
Once I get in my zone
I spark a J  and then say can ye (Kanye)
"watch the throne?"
Huh, was fucking broke for a while
So I ex'd her, success had a boyfriend
I got her number and text her
She call me ordinary
I said my first name was extra
Ambition schooled me to the art
But hunger was my lecturer, flow...
So special huh, nothing fresher
Cloth from a different cloth
See you, could check the texture
Hip-Hop was in a state or inertia
100 Crowns put under pressure
Check on your favourite rapper
Hope him well sha
We put the game on our backs
Cause the team strong
100 Crowns rap sicko heroes
These this the theme song
Y'all sneak dissing
When it comes to beef I like it raw
Your lungs ain't big enough for
All the smoke that you're asking for
Washed up rapper turn pop
Tryna son Hip-Hop artists
That's not it chief
Shut the fuck up regardless
Nobody asked you
Your opinion is trash talk
We not  not gon let that shht fly
Sit that plane on the Asphalt [groans]
I'm the head nigga in charge
The general and the serge
Y'all niggas is a mirage, verbal therapy
I give the beat a deep tissue massage
This is OG talk
Give your big homie my regards [groans]
Taking shots? get it right when you aim
You into career suicide I'm not the one to blame
Pregnant with ideas of using me tryna get ahead in the game? I'll commit abortions, I'll kill you before you get a name

[Verse 3: AQ]
The next rapper needs no introduction
I blossomed, three classic albums
I'm currently on my fourth one [laughs]
I make it hard for you to function
Y'all tried to blow up
I'll blow shht out of proportion
This is God's vision
I'm looking through perfect lenses
God body the God flow is in perfect tenses
God engineering, every time I let the pen speak
God's in him, Godzilla, break your defenses
Check the way I flip it, the bars apocalyptic
The fragment you imagine, imagination is vivid
My penmanship precision is wisdom and damn it is...
Making rappers madder than modern day feminists
Yo I'm, nemesis I've built businesses
And I can make you one
Natural resources my voice is vibranium
How you taking shots with a sub-par album
Those joints ain't strong enough, you lack calcium
Go against me, there can only be two outcomes
You lose, you lose, like Buhari or Atiku
If that's the premise on which you are voting
Then I don't need to
You can let them deceive you
But homie I ain't with you
You do it for the gram, I do it for what I believe in
Make your girls mouth a nice place to place kids in
The dick with the medicine
I hit her with the penicillin
She stuck on me like bacteria, I'm back tearing her
Fans never miss the real, me I never miss a kill
Here today gone tomorrow bro you're Mr. Real
Pick a fight pick a struggle I can fit the bill
To keep it real your best rapper still stuck on stupid deals
And if you can take it I'm coming with slim cases
When the lamba hit, the shaku will switch places
Lines from my sleek pages be spitting your rib cages
Leaving you fugazi, I'm kinda like 2 Jay-Z's
With a tide I rock nation I rock fellas I do ladies
Fuck the industry, I pay payola with suitcases
What you saying, who you playing
Who the fuck you fucking with?
All of y'all can suck a dick, I'm a legend like 2 Face is
May be not, I'm maybe close man
Fuck this shht man

[Verse 4: M.I Abaga]
[Sighs] sometimes rapping isn't fun at all
There's nothing I can brag about, I done it all
There's no(snow) rapper I can beef with man, I sun em all
And it's real (Israel) praying to the sky hoping that manna fall
Shht, double entendre in the in the first four
What am I (M.I) even on this verse for (four)?
Oh I get it, when you stick a knife inside a wound
That's healing up, it hurts more
I see the stares at what we building
You can never find the first floor
Ou, the cypher the maddest the baddest
And brightest and I'm the head
Always the head, like niggas sucking vaginas
We arrive to help you pussies out
My niggas are Gynos(Gynaecologists)
How we do it isn't fair, seems you guys are albinos ouu!
The boy terrific, and gifted and so prolific
Everything I push malicious it shifted the culture with it
Riveting imagery when M.I spit it
My music travel yes I move a pivot
Let me be more specific
I told you rappers fix up
Look at the way you niggas rapping now
SA rappers winning but guess what?
Naija is back in town
Call me NEPA dawg, all your life
I've been blacking out
Since 08 been on my captain Phillips
"I'm the captain now"
Four more bars, for my dawgs I got it
Loose and AQ we should make this episodic
Only open for rappers who deliver product
And yet that other Cognac, this is how to spend your budget
Fuck it!
