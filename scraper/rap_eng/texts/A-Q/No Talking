{Verse 1 : AQ}
No we never talking , i'm balling like Spaulding

All my niggas heartless, they'll leave you in darkness
Like a carcass in a carpet, boy we never talking
Late night we stalking, we caught em he walking
The foreign im parking, you niggas needa stop it!
I see it I cop it, we got them fat pockets
Yo bitch pop and drop it,  the whole gang she topping
I see all the way through you niggas like I'm watching
For the money, I'm not stopping, In the drop top you know I had to drop it!

{Verse 2: AQ}
