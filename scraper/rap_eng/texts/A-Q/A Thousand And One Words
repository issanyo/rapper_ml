Chorus:

I'm on the spot and
I'm running hot and
It's a long long way where I'm going
I just need a bigger stage for me to tell my story
Always got a thousand and one things to talk about nd I
Got tonight
To leave it on your mind, I can't keep it underground
Cos I'm on my way and
Good things must end but
You are my only friend
Oh yeah oh yeah yeah

Verse One (Martyn):

Let's just keep it real for a minute
I do it for the thrill not the business
I just cannot have no closing minutes
I just cannot run nobody's business
Youngin with a dream, welcome to the wild west
Luis Suarez, you biting more than you can digest
Things on your conscience
They call you on your bullshit and your nonsense
But they never seen your goal
The drive and the passion that's forever in your soul
The ones that open up to you are swallowing you whole but
I been on since I gave NorthStar my autograph
I'm the truth, no spikes on the polygraph
Young lion, you can't free lunch from my jaws
I bare the canines to hunt for my dawgs
Dentition stained red with the blood of grapes
I can't afford to go bananas in a world of apes, that's insane
And people came through for me
When all I ever wanted was to do one thing
If I call their names it'll take a whole song
But one day soon I'ma do a whole song, goddamn!
I'm the best I inspire
You was the best before, you expired
Dipping and dodging through the gauntlets, I'm a maverick
I go zero to a hundred thousand
I know they'll call me now, the ones who still got my number
And tell me how life changed me and made me proud and all that
Wow! So you still had my contact?
If you feel this way now, how you feel when I'm popping huh?

Chorus:

I'm on the spot and
I'm running hot and
It's a long long way where I'm going
I just need a bigger stage for me to tell my story
Always got a thousand and one things to talk about and I
Got tonight
To leave it on your mind, I can't keep it underground
Cos I'm on my way and
Good things must end but
You are my only friend
Oh yeah oh yeah yeah

Verse Two (A-Q):

I just feel like

It's like I'm talking to my diary
Lost in my dreams, I'm the only one that inspires me
It's an amazing feeling to figure out priority
But what's priority? That's currently the currency
It's a cold world we're living in
Keep on, no giving in
One God, I believe in him
So I keep on dreaming and
If you wanna go against me, come and get me then
The industry is sick and best believe I got the medicine
Only nigga rapping, couple others trapping
Some say they real hiphop but we unmask them
The distribution sodomizing them without Vaseline
No lubrication, just check the enumeration
Different fractions in the game, I'm the numerator
Different factors are to blame but where's the data?
The different platforms keep information off the radar
Your songs don't hold water, I took out the radiator
And radio only radiates for the paper
Tell M I'ma fix up my life sooner or later
We in the era of the Speed Darlingtons and Vicki O's
The future's Lil Uzi Vert and the Migos
But I still flow, and I still glow
And I'm still on top like a pinfold
And I'm still getting money with my kinfolk
And I'm still me, simple!

Chorus:

I'm on the spot and
I'm running hot and
It's a long long way where I'm going
I just need a bigger stage for me to tell my story
Always got a thousand and one things to talk about and I
Got tonight
To leave it on your mind, I can't keep it underground
Cos I'm on my way and
Good things must end but
You are my only friend
You are my only ...
As I lay me down to sleep
Please keep my soul from drowning in the deep cos
You're my only, my only friend
