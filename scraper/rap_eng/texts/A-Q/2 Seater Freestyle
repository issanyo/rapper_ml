{Intro}
Haa, AQ Nigga !!
Let me go in real quick....

{Verse 1}
Got my heat in the 2 seater
Got yo bitch and she a eater
Got my demons creeping with me
Nigga Wouldn't wanna be ya
Going harder than a seizure
Cuz I do it for my people
In the slums waiting for the day
That they could just be equal
All the shit that I done seen through
Got me coming with that lethal
Eye closed got me thinking If it could get any deeper
I see it all, don't make a sound
Going harder for that crown
Got the devil on my shoulder
Hells fire is where I'm bound
{?}, Let me break it down for em
Nigga what's important? The money and the foreign?
They got you playing yourself, niggas selling on they souls for the fame and the wealth
Still my heat in the 2 seater , got yo bitch and she a eater
Yea I see ya, flow hotter than a fever
Ya bitch for the squad I wouldn't wanna keep her
All these niggas fake wouldn't wanna be em
