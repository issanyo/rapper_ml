[Hook x2]
I got the work, (i got the work)

Pull-up skrtt, (pull-up skrtt)
Pull-up skrtt, skrtt, skrtt, skrtt
I got the work, (i got the work)
I got the work, work, work, work

[Verse 1]
I got the work, count it up like it's the first
Pussy sweet dessert, take off my shirt, making her squirt
You Niggas just making it worse, play with the gun, make it flirt
Body hit the dirt, in foreign, pull off skrrtt
You hate the way that I shine, it make you niggas blind
VVS look at the time, young rich nigga is how I define
M's I need about nine, dollar sign all on my mind
You know She One of a kind, hit from behind, nut on her spine

[Bridge]
I got the work in my sock
I got the birds like a flock
The cheese, the bag, the gwop
All the thots all on my cock
Look at her blowing the top, slob all on my knob
Two hoes had to swap, spinning round like a clock

[Hook x2]
I got the work, (i got the work)
I got the work, work, work, work
Smoking the purp, (smoking the purp)
Smoking the purp, purp, purp, purp
Pull-up skrtt, (pull-up skrtt)
Pull-up skrtt, skrtt, skrtt, skrtt
I got the work, (i got the work)
I got the work, work, work, work

I got the work, work, work, work
Pull-up skrtt, skrtt, skrtt, skrtt
Put yo bitch in reverse, and yo mans in a hearse
'Hold up, lemme break it down for em
'Hold up, pull up (skrttt skrrt skrrt) in the foreign
My diamond bluer than water, we pull-up and fuck on ya daughter
I'm balling shooting a floater, smoking woods rolling a quarter(Haaa)
Got Niggas changing like transformers, and they telling like informers

[Bridge 2]
All of my niggas gone do it, got a nigga froze no movin'
Snatch a nigga up he clueless, masked up like who this ?
AQ top 5 no provin' , fake niggas I'm removing
Outline him like a blue print, like Jordan never loosing

[Hook x2]
I got the work, (i got the work)

Smoking the purp, (smoking the purp)
Smoking the purp, purp, purp, purp
