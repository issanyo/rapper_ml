Look
And this how I feel when I'm on top of the world
Runnin up back on my chick, keepin' it real, I can be faking the fur
I can be kickin' a bitch, I can be lovin' a slut
Only be lovin the slit, see, I've been switchin these flows
And you, just drinkin on hoes, makin them rich, I've been expanding my mind
Leavin my limits with time, taking them trips, gotta believe in something
But lately, baby, maybe, real as a myth
I've been consoling my mind
Screamin' The House in this bitch, Village in here
I can be dealin with woes,  I can be breakin these hearts, feelings in here
Alice the woman no more
Look, maybe I'm trippin'
Blame it on God, fuck it for blamin' Rashad
Like maybe I'm slippin'
Maybe I'm overthinking, slowly sinking
Baby I'm dippin', shit is too backwards
Actors give me your roles
Killing myself, give me the sword, give me the gun
Die in a fort
