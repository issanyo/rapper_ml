[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
Man coming from a city where the heater bang
Nooga shooter Ruger, kill your brother that's that local fame
Always gave a fuck so much my Dockers wasn't Dickies man
Gotta keep it pimping James stomped them out, 44 deep, over cookies so
Imagine what they do to niggas acting like some pussy man
Austin daddy left him so abrupt now he hitting stains
Type of shit, make me say prayers for all my players
I’m here for all your fears you sell, I gotta scale
It’s real, riding, riding with my brother and his Lincoln
Got me thinking of get rich schemes for all my people
And maybe I should talk to my daddy, good karma
But fuck it I’m still stuck in these panties
Take relations for granted ‘stead of lowering standards
I did blow I didn’t plan it I’m understanding these addicts
Can you manage your habit? can you honestly practice?
All that shit that you preaching? always misplacing my glasses
But always peeping the evil like, I see it clear now
Like back in high school you’re the one that’s acting weird now
Had a baby in the 9th grade, shes old enough to cheer now
You see us getting money put that motherfuckin’ beer down
We’re here now

[Break: Isaiah Rashad]
We here now mothafucka
I think we need some motivation
We’re here now mothafucka
Give me that Sydney Jones pussy
I think we need some motivation

[Verse 2: Michael Da Vinci]
Many nights I shot ball 'til lights
Cut off on flight so probably fell my life
My momma was probably right I fill shoes to height
That Kobe could fit ‘em tight these niggas here is light
To get ahead they living like parasites and mice
And pussy will make them fight, I’m be sippin' this fucking sprite
For fillers I couldn’t write my big homie had died
For niggas who living lies he’s six feet from life
I hope heaven treating him nice, why good die in spite?
When Sydney Jones get piped, she young, black, and trife
My light skin advice, she keep me hooked like Phife
My electric relaxation, her thighs give me escapism
With music make me anxious, nigga be all tasteless
Sometimes I feel like hatred will kill me if I do make it
Three stacks vacations, secluded living locations
Illest amount of payments to bank accounts that I’m making
Seasons changing for us and we adding a couple faces
These niggas get funny so Benjamin keep me racing
Everybody a actor wanna be the leading faces
So get your acting right the directors giving our placements

[Outro: Michael Da Vinci and Isaiah Rashad]
My niggas die for it, she got that pussy juice
I could lie for it, that pussy the truth
You got some time boy, then get some pussy too
I’m the nigga baby, what that pussy do
My niggas die for it, she got that pussy juice
I could lie for it, that pussy the truth
You got some time boy, go get some pussy too
(Give me that Sydney Jones pussy
I think them niggas need some motivation)
