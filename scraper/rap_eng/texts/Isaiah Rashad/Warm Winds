Part 1

[Intro: SZA]
Hey, hey, glory child, hey

[Verse 1]
Hey, glory child, don't you worry
Stutterin', shakin' off your fear
Beauty's never given in a hurry
So condescending, leave your questions here
Hey, glory child, don't you worry
I can see your skeleton so clear
Doubting's only made your visions blurry
You're better off just looking in the mirror

[Chorus]
Show me a better way, I wish you could
Show me a better way, I wish you would
Come home today
You could come home today

[Verse 2]
I am shooting stars, don't you see me?
Watching over your every mistake
Digging out of graves is never easy
Handing you my shovel, here to take
Always playing catch-me-if-you-can
Gingerbreadâ€”you heard I'm sweet to taste
Close your eyes, let go, and count to ten
I'll keep track of every moment wasted

[Chorus]
Show me a better way, I wish you could
Show me a better way, I wish you would
Come home today
You could come home today

Part 2

[Intro: SZA + Isaiah Rashad]
Dear God, make me a bird, so I can fly far, far, far away
Dear God, make me a bird, so I can fly far, far, far away
Dear God, make me a bird, so I can fly far, far, far away
Warm winds on a space ride (space ride)
When I call your phone on a late night (late night)
I recall your soul had a taste like (taste like)
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds

[Chorus: SZA + Isaiah Rashad]
The clouds below your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes you hate to leave somebody
What's happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul had a taste like
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds
The clouds below your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes you hate to leave somebody
What's happening to we?
Warm Winds on a space ride

[Verse 1: SZA]
Sometimes I call your name out loud
Just to make sure it's you
Sometimes I crack my veins open
Just to see if it's blue
You clean me up

[Chorus: SZA + Isaiah Rashad]
The clouds below your feet
Clean
Quit clipping on your wings
Our wings, yeah
Sometimes we hate to leave somebody
You'll see
What's happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul had a taste like...
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds
The clouds below your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes we hate to leave somebody
What's happening to we?
Warm Winds on a space ride

[Verse 2: SZA]
Sometimes I bite my lips and close my eyes
Just to pretend it's you
Long live lonely thoughts on Thursday nights
That's when I think of you
We were all thirteen once (once) Long live tramp stamps and Pepper Ann (Pepper Ann)
You will never judge me for that
You will always love me for that

[Outro: SZA]
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes we hate to leave somebody
Whats happening to we?
Warm Winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul had taste like
Gardens, flowers
