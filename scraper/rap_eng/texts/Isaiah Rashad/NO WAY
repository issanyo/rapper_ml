[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
Yeah, get away, get away
Niggas say our lines like we on
I want whatever, no way
I want whatever she on
For like forever, eons
This shit ain't lookin' too sweet
If I could make it romance
I'd throw the hook at yo feet
Then I would drag you to that place
To make me happy with that torturer
Smooth visit
Throw the brass across yo neck
And a clasp across yo desk
And the last about yo breath
I'm just askin' for respect
So, whatever got you high to be thinkin' you the man
Bitch, quit talkin' to yo friends
'Fore we talkin' through a fence
Pill poppin' get you fucked
Sledgehammer get you bent

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad & Ambré]
No way, I can't be hanging with yo friends, no way, no way
I won't do lesser than a ten, no way, no way
I can't be fucking you again, no way, no way, no
No way, I can't be hanging with yo friends, no way, no way
I won't do lesser than a ten, no way, no way
I can't be fucking you again, no way, no way, no

[Verse 2: Ambré]
I must be dreaming, and when I awake
I will fly away, paradise
They need me to get real again
They said that the community is pillagin'
But we really we just numb and wanna feel again
The city's sleepin', the lights flicker
Swallow my pride and honor
On the same night that [?]
I can't keep falling into your waves
But you'll take all my time if I leave it to you, say I will

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad & Ambré]
No way, I can't be hanging with yo friends, no way, no way
I won't do lesser than a ten, no way, no way
I can't be fucking you again, no way, no way, no
No way, I can't be hanging with yo friends, no way, no way
I won't do lesser than a ten, no way, no way
I can't be fucking you again, no way, no way, no

[Verse 3: Joey Purp]
Yeah, purple
And she gon' throw a fit when I'm gone
She want whatever I'm with
I'm with whatever she on
She want forever, no way
She be my ball and my chain
That pussy feel like a lake
Your ponytail in my palm
I drown in you every day
Wake up with you every morn'
We lay chest to chest but don't see eye to eye anymore
Them lovebirds turn to burnin's
I'm stood inside of yo thorn
Would they pay to be a flower on our walls?
If wall flowers could talk
They tell yo secrets and more
When you're asleep it will be me you dream about, I am sure
I lie awake, it's always you I think about, I am yours
But I can't make no mistakes
Paying no bitch this much attention

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad & Ambré]
No way, I can't be hanging with yo friends, no way, no way
I won't do lesser than a ten, no way, no way
I can't be fucking you again, no way, no way, no
No way, I can't be hanging with yo friends, no way, no way
I won't do lesser than a ten, no way, no way
I can't be fucking you again, no way, no way, no

[Outro: Ambré]
No way, no way
No way, no way
No way, no way
