[From Snippet]

[J.I.D]
I grew too fast and I knew my daddy
I roll my fatty and zone now
I'm on the phone with a shone who tell me pull my bone out
I'm coming home now
I'm really on now

I need everything

[Isaiah Rashad]
I put myself before these hoes
I gotta a couple of kin
I left it wet for your nigga
I'm from the motherfucking South, put the pipe in her throat
Since my little brother told me hold it down, I'm coming straight out the door
You want it back, I brought it back
