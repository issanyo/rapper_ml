[Verse 1: Benny Cassette]
I'm at war with a wild heart
These constellations leave battle scars
So golden lady, are you to blame
I can't let go, I still got your check

[Hook: Benny Cassette]
Cause baby it hurts me
More than you know, more than you know
Cause baby it hurts me
More than you know, more than you know
I am the hunted, you are the hunter
I am the hunted, kill my freedom, virgo season
It's Virgo season (Alright, alright-Alright, alright)
It's Virgo season (Alright, alright-Alright, alright)
And I can't escape, it's Virgo season
(She come at this kid with the virgo)
(Kid-kid-kid with the virgo)
(Kid-kid-kid with the virgo)
(Kid-kid-kid with the virgo)
(Kid-kid-kid with the virgo)
(Kid-kid-kid with the virgo)
It's Virgo season

[Verse 2: Benny Cassette]
We at war, your my [?] weapon
It cuts me sweet, I never learn the lesson
My platinum bitch, my rose gold lover
My crucifix, Judas Last Supper

[Hook 2: Benny Cassette]
Cause baby it hurts me
More than you know, more than you know
Baby it hurts me
More than you know, more than you know
I am the hunted, you are the hunter
I am the hunted, kill my freedom, virgo season
It's Virgo season (Alright, alright-Alright, alright)
It's Virgo season (Alright, alright-Alright, alright)
And I can't escape

[Verse 3: Isaiah Rashad]
I ain't scared of the truth, cause lovin' you was more
Lovin' you was more than just a phase
I ain't scared of the truth, cause lovin' you was more
Lovin' you was more than just a phase
And time and time, I break my heart
Just to leave your ass alone
And time and time, I break my heart
Just to leave your ass alone
But I ain't scared of the seasons, often
Leave us, roses, blossom, make a baby
I just wanna make a home and
Take me back to way before ya
Waitin' for ya, wasted for ya
Sun might shine but scorch the soil
Seize your soul here, what could grow here
So what is love for me but

[Hook 3: Benny Cassette]
It hurts me
More than you know, more than you know
Baby it hurts me
More than you know, more than you know
I am the hunted, you are the hunter
I am the hunted, kill my freedom, virgo season

[Outro: Isaiah Rashad (2x)]
I ain't scared of the seasons (Kid-kid-kid with the virgo)
The summer, the winter (Kid-kid-kid with the virgo)
The fall (Kid with the virgo, kid with the virgo)
