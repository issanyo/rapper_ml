[Verse 1]
Young nigga can't love no more, pussy ass niggas
Broke over 28 grams
Who the fuck and what the fuck we 'spose to do with it?
My brother used to ride the bucket with the tube in it
Six-12's, heard you trapping with a mean soundtrack
Do you need some bubble, do you drink?
Man, my uncle was a cool sleep walker
Don't be backin' away
The Benz that he wanted got him back in the race
I feel like I shouldn't put it back in your face
But here is the motherfucking bat at the base
And steer into motherfucking lacquer today
I'm cracking the case, as Johnny would say
From babies, your liquor bottle would pop if it's me
Your topic was hella bogus, you fucking with everybody
I see how you over do it
I knew my idol was inferior, I just needed something to believe huh

[Hook]
Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh
Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh
Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh
Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh

[Verse 2]
Quit tripping, you don’t feel like paper
Talk like money, these days niggas intervene like bitches
12 know, he was at the green light twitching
Praying that I got a balance beam my nigga
Looking like I got a balance beam my nigga
Maybe it was me, I was running to the east side
Touched down, looking like I made one
These days, these hoes caught you, fishing for a baller
Bitch I never wanna go to Winnie Lake
And I never reminisce about my old shit
I guess I figured from the signs, them bitches did a line
And then them bitches did some more shit
I should’ve caught it on film, but most won’t believe us
Fuck ‘em, can you keep a secret? I'mma keep it for myself
Wonder why your mission always fucking up the mood
Wonder why your mission-

[Hook]
Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh
Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh
Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh
Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh
