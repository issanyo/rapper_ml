[Verse 1]
Young nigga can't love no more, pussy ass niggas
Broke over 28 grams, who the fuck, and what the fuck we 'sposed to do with it?
My brother used to ride the bucket with the tube in it
Six twelves, heard you trapping with a mean sound track
Do you need some, bubble, do you drink?
Man my uncle was a cool sleep walker
Don't be backing away, the Benz that he wanted got him back in the race
I feel like I shouldn't put it back in your face, but here is the motherfuckin bat at the base
And steer into motherfucking lacquer today, I'm cracking the case, as Johnny would say
From baby's your liquor bottle would impoverish me
Yo Top, it was hella bogus, you fucking with everybody, I see how you overdo it
I knew my idol was inferior, I just needed something to believe, huh

[Hook]
Saw the fist go up when the shit goes down
On the Westside, oh
(x4)

[Verse 2]
Quit tripping, you don't feel like paper, talk like money
These days niggas intervene like bitches
12 know, he was at the green light twitching
Praying that I got a balance beam, my nigga
Looking like I got a balance beam, my nigga
Maybe it was me, I was running to the East Side
Touch down looking like I'm A1, these days these hoes cuz you fisher for a baller
Bitch I never wanna go to Winnie Lake, and I never reminisce about my old shit
I guess I figured from the signs, them bitches did a line, and then them bitches did some more shit
I should've caught it on film, my mo won't believe us
Fuck em, can you keep a secret, ima keep it for myself
Wonder why your mission always fucking up the mood
Wonder why your mission --

[Hook]
Saw the fist go up when the shit goes down
On the Westside, oh
