Look at how I'm riding in my bucket, I be cooling
95 degrees, no A/C, but I be cooling
No exaggeration, fucking bitches, I be doing
My pockets hella empty, but these bitches steady choosing

[Verse 1]
To this pimping, I'm a student, I need a job
This rap ain't paying bills, okay, blame it on Rashad
I get all in my feelings gather, blame it all on God
But see that ain't the lesson that was taught up from my mom
I be that Pretty Nigga Flacko â€“ fuck that shit, fuck that bitch
See that shit don't make no sense, he ain't even gotta lisp
It's so many fuck rappers, I can't even make a diss
It's so many fuck niggas, ain't no need to make a list
And tell my momma I'll be straight, all I need is dutches
Swishers, hide my insecurity, crowded by a bunch of niggas
They just don't be hearing me, you gon' start comparing me
Diamond in the rough, suck my dick, you'll see the clarity
Later I won't, won't be this same mothafucka
As soon as I get on, one insane mothafucka
I guess all them concussions, rattled brain mothafucka
And we don't wanna hear that weak shit, but you love it
I be high all in public, see sobriety's a struggle
They pay they bills hating, see, denying me's a hustle
I been drinking, I been drinking
See the fly in me, I'm buzzing (That weak shit)
