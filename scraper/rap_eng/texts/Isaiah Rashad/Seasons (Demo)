[Intro]
Seasons change
There's still time for us to run away
Seasons change
There's still time for us to run away
Seasoâ€”

[Chorus]
Closed eyes, that's how you runnin' from your destiny
Superpowers can't relieve that
Dear God, why can't you keep me from these outsiders?
We're outside, outside, out (side, out)
Still runnin', can't let this jungle get the best of me
Superpowers can't relieve that
Dear God, why can't you keep me from these outsiders?
We're outside, outside, out

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Closed eyes, that's how you runnin' from your destiny
Superpowers can't relieve that
Dear God, why can't you keep me from these outsiders?
We're outside, outside, out (side, out)
Still runnin', can't let this jungle get the best of me
Superpowers can't relieve that
Dear God, why can't you keep me from these outsiders?
We're outside, outside, out
