[Verse 1 Kembe X]
And all I ever wanted was a Lexus
Topless preferably
I'd smoke her out like daily, have some time to encourage me
Break necks when I pull off, niggas too lame
Maybe all them bitches stop and stare just cause the shoe game crazy
23s, 23s
On the whip
When I skrrt off
I can't help but to crack this swisher sweet
Burn hurt off in a zip
Never trip
When they mention me
Somebody snap this picture please
Bad bitch and her friend finna dip with me
And I act like it never meant shit to me

[Julian Malone]
It's on nigga, keys open doors and start the engine
Mercedes and Lexus swag, both yellow just like a lemon
Took a couple test runs, inspect em for good suspension
Both passed with flying colors, drove fast with good precision
Bad bitches wanting me more, jealousy making em go
For me like never before
Kobe, I'm riding on 4s
Who knows, might be one of your hoes
Staring while I ignore
Hopin I let her roll
To flex to foes

[Hook - Isaiah Rashad]
Now this is what you ride for
Golden diamond plated vices
Getcha shine for it
Buy a Lexus, lose your license
Do some time for it
And it's so lonely at the top
But would you die for it?
Would you die for it?

[Verse 2 Julian Malone]
See I'm on nigga, them keys open doors and help em listen
Bitches is patient and act vacant when you wh-wh-whip em
In the lot
Full of hella goofies, hoopties [?]
Freshest thing that she's ever seen in this fucking spot
Evident that I'm pretty arrogant, but I'm elegant
Also discredited, but not for long for definite
Edited for excellence
So pestilence to pessimists
Rollin round, rollin-rollin round
With that Lexus bitch

[Kembe X]
And all I ever wanted was Alexis
Topless preferably
Would gas her up like daily
And it's been awhile since she heard from me
Break necks when I'm with her
Niggas too lame mayne
See she got these bitches hating on her
Cause her shoe game crazy
Double D's, Double D's
On a bitch
I still flirt off
I can't help but to crack a smirk
And ask her homegirl for a kiss
I ain't shit, niggas envy me
Hate that they grant my wishes
Sneak bad bitch from her man and she dip with me
And I act like it never meant shit to me

[Hook - Isaiah Rashad]
Now this is what you ride for
Golden diamond plated vices
Getcha shine for it
Buy a Lexus, lose your license
Do some time for it
And it's so lonely at the top
But would you die for it?
Would you die for it? x3

Ridin' out with my niggas, rollin up them swishers
Ridin' out with my niggas, rollin up them swishers
I'm just Ridin' out with my niggas, rollin up them swishers
I'm posted up with 8 bitches
Way sexier than they pictures x2
