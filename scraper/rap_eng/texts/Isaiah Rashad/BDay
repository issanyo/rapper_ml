[Intro: Isaiah Rashad]
Bum, bum, bum, ba, bum
Yeah feel me
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad]
Oh, believe I feel great  today
I can't help but just pour my drink
'Cause sometimes it be talkin' to a nigga
Yeah sometimes I be talkin' back
Sometimes I be, ha
I swear

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
Play me, nigga I'm faded
Nigga I feel like 25 babies
Skunk drunk, lookin' like a robber
Headed to the church or headed to the brothel
Poppin' my collar, really like Bieber
How do you tell the truth to a crowd of white people?
Made it, motivational speaker, bumpin'
Most time tellin' my teacher somethin'

[Bridge: Isaiah Rashad]
Baby we was like Decatur
We was like Lithonia elevated thinker, bump it
Deacon, stuntin' was a habit
Trappin' was a hobby, shooter got a reason
Thumper, Sasha why you gotta leave me?
We was like forever life is so confusin', fuck it
Take me, take me to revival
Maybe this'll help me, maybe this'll change my mind

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad & Deacon Blue]
Oh, believe I feel great today
I might just pour my drank
'Cause sometimes it be talkin' to a nigga
Yeah sometimes I be talkin' back
Sometimes I be, uh, uh, yeah

[Post-Hook: Isaiah & Deacon Blue]
House-side niggas always stuffin' a few
Southside niggas always keepin' it there
.45 trigger gave 'em somethin' to do
We shoulda shot at the moon
House-side niggas always stuffin' a few
Southside niggas always keepin' it there
.45 trigger gave 'em somethin' to do
We shoulda shot at the moon

[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad & Deacon Blue]
Jesus always told me I was special
Mommy told me go and get some money
Spread shit to the world
'Cause ain't no fun if the homies can't have some
Have mine, nigga heaven ain't free
We was just prayin' for another drink
Bitch look good to a buzzard, hey
I could barely hear from the thunder, wait
I could barely feel for the money, wait

[Bridge: Isaiah Rashad & Deacon Blue]
Baby we was like Decatur
We was like Lithonia elevated thinker, bump it
Deacon, stuntin'  was a habit
Trappin' was a hobby, shooter got a reason
Thumper, Sasha why you gotta leave me?
We was like forever, life is so confusin', fuck it
Take me, take me to revival
Maybe this'll help me, maybe this'll ease my mind

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad & Deacon Blue]
Oh, believe I feel great today
I might just pour my drank
'Cause sometimes it be talkin' to a nigga
Yeah, sometimes I be talkin' back
Sometimes I be, yeah, ha

We shoulda shot at the moon

[Outro: Kari Faux]
Ridin' down the street with the hazard lights on
Turn my phone off while I'm switchin' time zones
Lost in the sauce not sure where I stand
You can't call me back if you can't pay me in advance
Ridin' down the street with the hazard lights on
Turn my phone off while I'm switchin' time zones
Lost in the sauce not sure where I stand
You can't call me back if you can't pay me in advance
