[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
Ooh, top five top five top five top five I mean no doubt
True, repo make sure we took your house we need the couch
Too late, where you been at? Where you at? We need the fence
Mayne, so much that kid snuck from the bathroom off the fence
Mayne, we bump your shit like when I'm high and when the rent
Ain’t, several, figures, where your friends?
Say wassup to the option and all these adoptions
And the Phil was the healer and Robert the doctor
We felt the bruises and knives
And the location implode
Got a little faith in me still
Ayy, yeah, yeah
Hang with the makers, don't fault
Just hang with the makers
Be who you are
Right? TUT

[Verse 2: TUT]
Nigga, bigger and better than all of y'all, anyone
I'll tell him to his face like
Shit, riding round with the bass like
20 inch rims with them center plates absolutely
Sick of the lies, shucking and jiving
More conniving, I'm riding in my G-30 fizz-ive
Rolling up weed in my G-30 fizz-ive
Made a lot of green in my G-30 fizz-ive (yeurn)
Back and bossed up
I just touched down, I Randy Moss’d 'em
I be taking the payment, stacking the savings
Can't blow all your cheddar my dog, you do better
Running through the city sitting pretty like hair on hoes
I'm here, I'm home, I'm high off life
I'm high off sprite, mixed with a little hi-tech
We got twenty bags, we got dime sacks
Never play myself short now it's off to the airport
Another classic got niggas waiting to export
More spiritual than lyrical
But still I need my residual, absolutely
Never find it even with credit cards
I hold my nuts, and when I hit that wall I run through it
'Til my niggas hit that mall and run through it
This is more than music, nigga I swear that

[Pre-Hook:  TUT & Isaiash Rashad]
I'ma get a Roley and a house just like Uncle Willy
Big ass house in the woods
Kick my shitty ass bucket to the curb when I start rollin' 'round in a Bentley
Got a ride in a big ass ride
Might pull up on my old hoes just so I can stunt on the bitches
Stunt on them broke ass hoes
Cause we just went and did a lot of shit, just so we could say that we did it

[Hook: TUT]
Ayy, I got the bounce to make you feel like
Yeah, nappy 'fro got the hoes like
Yeah, Shell Toes on my toes like
Big homie on the phone like
"Fuck up them niggas man just be true to yourself
That's what you made for
That's what you prayed for
Nigga everybody gotta hustle for somthin'
Work for the come-up
Influence the culture"
Like I'm a leader

[Bridge: TUT]
This the shit that we used to talk about in my G-30 fizz-ive
Had about an ounce and a digi-scale in the rizzide
TUT be off the easy fo-sheezy
Moving on up like George and Weezie

[Verse 3: TUT]
Y'all so sleep nigga wake up
Young ass nigga about to fuck the game up
So impressed, I'm so invested
Shit ain't been the same since, the mom on Fresh Prince
It's funny how we switched the game up
Took niggas to church like a church bus
Fuck the bullshit this is real rap
Preacher's Son a year old and it still slap
I might, pull up on a rapper tell 'em get on this shit
Boy you a mess, make it look so easy do you see the finesse? Building your job
Searching for your surface out of vacant facade
My God, we thank God we living it up
When the world got you down, I'll be building you up
Ain't shit to it it's just music
Don't let fear of failure scare you

[Interlude: TUT & Friend]
Ahhhh King TUT my nigga, what's going on?
What's going on man, how you doing?
Hey I see you and Isaiah Rashad holding it down in these streets man, putting on for Chattanooga the city
Yeah man, I appreciate it man
Oh yeah man, lemme' ask you a question. You think you can sell a nigga 20 sack man?
Nah man I can't do that man I don't even sell weed
Hey man you can't sell a 20 sack man?
Man if I could I would, bruh I promise
Aight well, can I at least pray for you, lemme get your hands
