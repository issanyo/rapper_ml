[Intro]
Beat tight as fuck. Turn up! Turn the light off, Des, turn it down. Aye, you roll up? You’ll roll up for the boys? For the Squad? Nah, that’s Ty job right now. Aye, check me out

[Chorus]
If I can pay my bills, I'm good, I'm comin' over
Found a message in my bottle your son is comin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – what Yari saying?
You ain’t nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up
Listen here I say my dude and what you call it
It was heaven at the bottom and peace from throwin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – my Yari saying
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up

[Verse 1]
I think I do this shit for real dawg
Hey, I ain't no motherfuckin' maybe
I'm for motherfuckin' real dawg
Hey mama, mama
I got some dollars for your bills, though (Bills though)
Hey, now I'm the hit and I'm the topic
All that matters I'm Jaleel dog,  hey
You know I think the sunshine
Should feel how I feel, how I feel like yeah
I think at night time, the moon should call my phone
Hit my line, I'm here for you
And Eastside shame on us
Rain come on now
I figured the mood
I figure, I figure

[Chorus]
When I pay my bills I'm good, I'm comin' over
Found a message in my bottle your son is comin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – what Yari saying?
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up
Listen here I say my dude and what you call it
It was heaven at the bottom and peace from throwin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – my Yari saying
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up

[Verse 2]
I got a dollar and a stop in Kansas
Toto to do or do not, do not forget me
I been wylin' Santa, pop and rock 'em
Lord forgive 'em for the talcum powder
Alright now stretch it, bless it
Bless it my brother and his record
On the record, for the record
Hey, and play it back 'cause they respect us
Alright now I got the moon and the stars below my feet
So low I speak
So I don't wake them, praise the Lord that got in me
Who made me spoiled with rotten teeth
So I perform the prophecy
And on the norm the plot could be
To be expressing who we are and addressin' who they aren't
And doin' what they can't...and want

[Chorus]
If I can pay my bills, I'm good, I'm comin' over
Found a message in my bottle your son is comin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – what Yari saying?
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up
Listen here I say my dude and what you call it
It was heaven at the bottom and peace from throwin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – my Yari saying
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
