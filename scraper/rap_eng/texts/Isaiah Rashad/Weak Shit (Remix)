[Hook/Intro: Isaiah Rashad]
I gotta get my cool nigga voice on
Yeah straight up like
From Chatanooga you know what I'm saying to fucking.....
(It's The House bitch)
For all my niggas riding in buckets you know what I'm saying
Fuck with me.....Ugh, Aye

Look at how I'm riding in my bucket, I be cooling
95 degrees, no A/C, but I be cooling
No exaggeration, fucking bitches, I be doing
My pockets hella empty, but these bitches steady choosing

[Verse 1]
To this pimping, I'm a student, I need a job
This rap ain't paying bills, okay, blame it on Rashad
I get all in my feelings gotta blame it all on God
But see that ain't the lesson that was taught up from my mom
I be that Pretty Nigga Flacko â€“ fuck that shit, fuck that bitch
See that shit don't make no sense, he ain't even gotta lisp
It's so many fuck rappers, I can't even make a diss
It's so many fuck niggas, ain't no need to make a list
And tell my momma I be straight, all I need is dutches
Swishers, hide my insecurity, crowded by a bunch of niggas
They just don't be hearing me, you gon' start comparing me
Diamond in the rough, suck my dick, you'll see the clarity
Later I won't, won't be this same mothafucka
As soon as I get on, one insane mothafucka
I guess all them concussions, rattled brain mothafucka
And we don't wanna hear that weak shit, but you love it
I be high all in public, see sobriety's a struggle
They pay they bills hating, see, denying me's a hustle
I been drinking, I been drinking
See the fly in me, I'm buzzing (That weak shit)

Alright now Look at how I'm riding in my bucket, I be cooling
95 degrees, no A/C, but I be cooling
No exaggeration, fucking bitches, I be doing
My pockets hella empty, but these bitches steady choosing
Look at how I'm riding in my bucket.....
Look at how I'm riding in my bucket
Look at how I'm riding in my bucket I be
But these bitches steady choosing
Swag
(laughs) FUCK THEM NIGGAS.......

[Kris Prince Intro/Hook]
.....Aight, I guess I gotta get my smooth nigga voice on
From Chicago to.....
Gone Til' Further Notice I'm....
I can't wait until the day that I'm
Yo H.I.P.P.I.E.S. 2 Look

Ok Now look at how I'm riding in my bucket I be rolling
42 degrees, got no heat, but i be cruising
No elaboration, porno bitches I be doing
My pockets hella empty but these bitches still choosing

To you rappers, keep it moving, go get a job
This rap ain't paying off & i won't pay to see it live
They lying to face I gotta blame on ya squad
Im seeing all that pressure that you putting on ya moms
Im getting sick and tired of music, take yo bitch, shoot that shit
I be smoking on the best, all them gun sound effects
Its so many fake rappers I can't even have a voice
Its so many bad bitches I can't even make a choice
I told my girlfriend to pray, argue all day
She project her insecurites, think Im fucking bitches
All that nagging be annoying me, you gone start comparing me
Pair me to your ex, suck that clit you wanna marry me
Later I won't be the same mufucka, as soon as I get on you gone change to another
Just like the spring time you gone change to the summer
& we dont wanna hear that weak shit, but YOU support it
I ain't down for relations see committing is a struggle
They pay they bills trickin' got me looking into pimpin
Hair is foreign
See that foreign
In that foreign
Thats imported
Thats my bitch: THAT WEAK SHIT
