[Verse 1: Theory]
Barely sober hope my mom dont see me floating
Chokin on components but cop another while im copin
Emotions overflowing
White cups for the toastin
And i dont want to have to go home in the morning
See me smoke
1, 2, 3 (4, & 5)
Take another 3
And chuck dueces at that 1 beat
Loving my illusions
Like the one where I was born free
Tryna leave the city where they talk like it was never cheap

Lets have a feast
When we feeling empty
Test me
I got Grade A work for my enemies
Flexing, know you crampin styles while you ain't see
Best be, passing me the leaf cuz I dont want beef

And hoes love it
When im high off life cuz they know
Im getting faded, I could fuck all night
Ya'll to busy poppin molly's, you can die off height
My favorite rapper in the mirror but his mind ain't right
I know it

[Chorus: Ayanna Love]
I had a couple dreams
And I wonder
If I can call you, tomorrow
And borrow your heart

See I been stressin for a best
One that will set me a part
Set me a part

See I got all my problems
But I dont have no weed
When they say simply solve them
I say no not me
& I dont love no more
& Ill just let you be
& you seen all my problems but you still handle me

[Verse 2: Brandon Allen]
Got to, get the anxiety off my chest
My dream is a mustard seed with these lyrics I manifest
Reality In the soil of my faith & happiness
To sow the seed and then sprout all great things and nothing less
I got to...

Got to get the society off my neck
Not talking bout motherboards when I say that I got the tech-
Nique but keep it discreet
Secrete the heat from head to feet
Leap over fears in my leap years
And Im leapin over feats
Feature me in the books of history I'm breaking brackets
It looks to me you never looked at me , I always had this
Blunts bigger than you lit niggas so can you match this ?
A handle on my gavel to battle like Judge Mathis
Handing niggas paddles to travel up shits creek path just
Wait no minutes longer I'm stronger to deal some damage
Tell competition who isnt cognizant of the MANZ clique
So competition i am omniscient fuck who ya MANZ is

And to all my old woman
Who left me all behind
All up on my line
Ask if I remember the time
You wanted me to wife you and for me that was just fine
But patience is a virtue
I guess you ain't have the time
And I wasn't tryna find
That my music had declined
So I guess our bond flatlined
Was just another way God was showing me a sign
To literate the literature and read between the lines
Liberate candidates with rhymes
I feel like
I feel like I'm risking innocent lives
Each time I pick up my pen I feel like a rapper just died
Died to self had it rough but now I'm smoother than St. Ives
Roll my issues in the leaf and now I elevate to sky
Im out
