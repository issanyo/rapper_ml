[Hook: Isaiah Rashad]
I ain't eatin' in the morn' I be sippin' on the Henny, Henny
You been lookin' for the wrong one, wrong one, wrong one
Ain't thinkin' bout your love I be shittin' on your feelings, feelings
And you be lovin' on the wrong one, wrong one, wrong one

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
My daddy taught me how to drink my pain away
My daddy taught me how to leave somebody
My daddy taught me how to smoke my load and go
My daddy taught me you don't need nobody
So one time for the caged bird
And one time for the real niggas
And slow dance on the JÃ¤ger
And one time for the little niggas

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad]
I ain't eatin' in the morn' I be sippin' on the Henny, Henny
You been lookin' for the wrong one, wrong one, wrong one
Ain't thinkin' bout your love I be shittin' on your feelings, feelings
And you be lovin' on the wrong one, wrong one, wrong one
