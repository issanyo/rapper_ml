[Hook: Isaiah Rashad (2X)]
One time for the real niggas, one time for the little niggas
We climb for the thrill of it, rewind to the feel of it
No crime, just a little money
One time for the caged bird, one time for the vapors
Slow dance on the Jager, one time for the vapors, yeah

[Verse 1: Kembe X (Isaiah Rashad)]
Okay my conscience hit me with some common sense and so I consequently came through (Now I’m here)
Up and drop your shit, and leave your momma crib is something lots of niggas can’t do (No sir)
They wanna crack a card, they wanna cop a pistol, pop molly pills and let loose
I’m tryin’ to be the plug, they tryin’ to shop with them
So it ain't shockin’ when you see they pockets thin and that’s funny
Lately every move these niggas makin' just ain't makin' no sense
Wanted change but ain't breakin' no singles
Wanna get it but can't take a hint
I'mma run it eventually, I'm chasin' it right now because every race ain't a sprint (right)
We humans in they defense, I be sinnin' too much to repent (true shit)

[Bridge: Isaiah Rashad (Kembe X)]
Sometimes my body feel like a cage (feel like a cage)
And if I bomb I'll probably sip on some 'Jäge (sip on some 'Jäge)
Since a little nigga I've been on that one love
Keep it a buck, A.D.D really sums up
Odd little nigga tryin' to even it up
It's too easy, you need to give up, lil' bitch (lil' bitch)

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad (2X)]

[Verse 2: Kembe X]
So one time for my niggas that be ridin' for they niggas
Livin' life like it was designed for they niggas
I'm a livin' light, stuck up in this whole little maze
Me and you don't think alike, I got my own little lane
Own little problems, pressures, vices, reflect on the lovely little lesson, life is
Learned to be wrong and I earned plenty stripes
And returned pretty strong, what a blessing
I just want a Lexus, I just want a sign
They droppin' out was reckless but shit I'm doin' fine
Tryin' to be a legend, promised I would radiate perfection
That was when the seven's had aligned
All of this is destined
Look up in the stars everything is your perception
Use it as a weapon
Heavy into winnin' niggas doomed to be second
It's just me and my Village, ain't no room to be freshmen
I lost my mind
Shit, I'mma let it find me this time
I'm sick of the games it got me feelin' insane
But still I rise
So one time for the Vill niggas (Hey!)
It's our time, nigga deal with it (Hey!)
Seen hard times but I'm still winnin'
And I promised I wouldn't change and I still didn't
Village Up!
