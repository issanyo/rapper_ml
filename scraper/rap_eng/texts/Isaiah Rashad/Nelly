[Intro]
Bitch you know you can't parallel park anyway

[Hook]
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one, cause they gon' do you wrong
And they gon' play you out, alright, alright, alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one, cause they gon' do you wrong
And they gon' play you out, alright, alright, alright

[Verse 1]
Back when my brother sold crack, and my sister was a real one
Always was a real one
Saw you workin' early, tell me how you feel, hon
Baby what's your hurry? Get it how you live, hon
Baby what's your name? I've been goin' through a lot
I can't do this on my own, got no place to go Rashad
And that's a long one, hey they gon' love you when you're hot
They won't miss you when you gone, if you looking for a spot
That's the wrong one

[Hook]
But we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one, cause they gon' do you wrong
And they gon' play you out, alright, alright, alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one, cause they gon' do you wrong
And they gon' play you out, alright, alright, alright

[Verse 2]
Back when my sister sold hair, heard you lookin' for the deal, hon
Get it how you live, hon
Damn you caught me splurgin', lookin' for the real ones
If I make it early, get it for the little ones
I can see your pain, hope my voice is helping out
Hope your mama workin' out, she won't even come out the house
Heard she had a surgery, granny died before the drop
I don't like to visit home, I don't like to see the drought
Call me when you steppin' out, I might bring the cup with me
I might play the "Back and Forth", on my '94 Aali'
We can split a O or three, this is how it's supposed to be
Like we had a better trial, fuck the jury, fuck with me
We on our own, hon

[Hook]
But we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one, cause they gon' do you wrong
And they gon' play you out, alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one, cause they gon' do you wrong
And they gon' play you out, alright, alright, alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one, cause they gon' do you wrong
And they gon' play you out, alright
