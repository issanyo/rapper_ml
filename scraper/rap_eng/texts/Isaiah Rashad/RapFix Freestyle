[Verse]
Baby how you doing, how you living for the summer?
Like I reply "Like getting high" and probably getting money
Back when I was flipping sourdough and holding onions
Reckon how this change but I'mma [?] still snatch it from them
Players stuck in Chat', they getting effed, they getting tecs
Hold onto protection, you gonna need it in a strap
Niggas playing with you and go and plot behind your back
The newest revolution, where the picket activist?
Yes cause, I sip lean, and I ain't perfect
But I don't dream, cause God ain't curse me
Wash my sins, but clean up righteous
I sell your soul, but save it's vices
My clique be down just like me
This sounds so priceless
And you can't find it
This show so private
You dig my flow, just diving
And lose your title, they talk like rivals
But wanna join my tribal, I wanna fuck yo chick
And ride my tank
I need a shooter, no diva with me
An X when you need them
These [?] stress with the refer, am I supposed to be happy?
Can I post behind Hippies, I'm back and forth with these lyrics
I'm not composed when I'm [?], I'm back and forth with these spirits
I spill it all with my soul, I'm praying hurt but they hear it
