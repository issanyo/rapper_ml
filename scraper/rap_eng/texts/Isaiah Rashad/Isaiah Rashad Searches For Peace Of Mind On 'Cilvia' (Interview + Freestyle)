Imagine being a, not a, not necessarily a rapper but being an artist, who, like I draw from what's happening right now all the time. I draw from the conversation that's happening right now, and all I can think to rap about is, I'm around the biggest rapper in the world and my whole life has changed

Like, signing and being where I'm at really just put me in the middle of "All I gotta do is make music" and you never think about how much pressure you can put on yourself when all you gotta do is make music

When that's all you gotta do, and try to make you like this shit, and then try to make her like this shit, and try to make him like this shit, it's like, it fucks with your head G

Rapping and making music only shit that really, gives me some type of peace, peace of mind. It's like the first time in my life where I'm at like a peaceful place, and it's, it's like, you gotta find a way to make people identify with peace man, nobody really at peace
