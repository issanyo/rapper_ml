[Verse 1]
Modest, I, be in interviews, so niggas hating
Cause I play it like, I no have no clue that I'm the greatest
Tori come, sit up on this dick, I see you waiting
Need a baby cause I'm too young and wild to be the savior
Nail me to the cross and I'm just hanging
Least they left the serpent in my fingers, I'm just smoking
Players from my city rarely make it to a poster
'less you got a warrant, what you got in that Corolla? (Hey)
Oh, officer, just Boosie Boo and DG Yola, listen
Won't let them haters get me down, that's what they told us
It's funny how they blame the south when they weak shit don't blow up
We came with all the funk while niggas act like they don't know us
Just living a lie, OG's, acting like hoes, we couldn't rekindle the fire
Nigga, retire, nigga, catch up with the time, I can see more than the block
I can see more than your spot, I don't be stuck in the past, homie, I'm puffing
The grass, holding my cup like a strap, look at my southerner ass

[Hook]
Niggas try to tell you what you want
But niggas rarely give you what you need
Ay, bitch, I came right here with the bounce
And if that ain't enough I got some weed
Yeah, cause
Niggas try to tell you what you want
But niggas rarely give you what you need
Ay, bitch, I came right here with the bounce
And if that ain't enough I got some weed
Yeah, cause

[Verse 2]
Quiet, I be in living room, cuh, nigga shaded
With my Nia Long, I sing her a song, she masturbating
Then bring me along, she got something to say like Larry David
But I leave her lone, ho, I gotta go, I got a baby
Stuck in Babylon, niggas carry bombs and carry rabies
Who gon' speak for you? Who gon' sing your song if you don't play this?
I got stress for days, picture you go home and you that nigga
But can't pay your bill, you can't buy no diapers for your little one
Don't you pay for thrill, child support is like a check away
How you chill with Kendrick? Do you smoke with Q and Dr. Dre?
Least today is real, I should ask some groupie for some face
Just a stepping stone, least them kind of bitches know their place
This my second home, this where favorite rappers get replaced
This what the niggas from the South gon' kill that, doubt it, bring the bass
Bitch, I came here right here with an ounce
And if that ain't enough you gotta leave
