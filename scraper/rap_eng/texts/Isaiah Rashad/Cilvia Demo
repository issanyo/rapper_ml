[Intro]
10-4, 10, 10-4. Hello? We-got- We got a  4-2-3. We got a young man riding around, in a Natty Caddy, hehe
Not Natty Caddy, not that at all

[Verse 1]
Who's that creepin' through the city in that dark ass tint
Misdemeanor on the way yo
I slide in my rimless Bentley, no tights, I'm gymnast
Bending blocks, my world of Legos
Now baby, hold that wheel while I'm rollin' up
Hopefully she old enough
To purchase that liquor, what I need from the store
She understands her selection, advance her affection
And fears my rejection, never needing a ho
I got plans to be that nigga, I know you met him as a child
He gave you 10 bones, don't sweat it, don't wile'
Be cool for a minute, '93 'Til be cool for Emmett
The hung soul a rapper goes rapping those wrapping woes up
Defying foes, lying toes, weapons on tuck
Malcolm, they tackle for belief in the movement
But Rashad got applause for releasing the music

[Hook]
Now sometimes I be gettin' higher than a bitch
Smoking all my lows, put the fire to the spliff
What up, now what up
Now I've been getting higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
Now what up, now what up, now what up, what up

[Verse 2]
Ay, ay, ay, yeah
Niggas steppin' in the swimming pool, invincible
Women I pursue get lost in this, uh
Middle of the summer's in Miami
Kembe with me, Henney, sippin shots like I bought it for him
I'm a brown skin small waisted
I'm creeping with my ball faces, I like her titties too
I like her attitude, I like her flexible
She got a baby due, I think she bisexual
At least I hope so
I glance to that little grown man at her front door
He looking at me like I looked at pops when he come fo'
My mama as a toddler I was selfish this ain't nothin' new
I can spit a couple 22s if I want to
I save it for the tour, the allure of the gap tooth
Rap Toose in shape or somethin'
Always knew he would make him something
He got schemes to smoke green
And make him some, take em son

[Hook]
Now sometimes I be gettin' higher than a bitch
Smoking all my lows, put the fire to the spliff
What up, now what up
Now I've been getting higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
Now what up, now what up, now what up, what up
