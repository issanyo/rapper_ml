[Hook]
Meal ticket, ticket, meal ticket, ticket, comma, uh
Steel in my liver, real hittas in my condom, huh
Chill hit me back, filled this one with a power rap
Pill bring me back, feel this one out in Saratoga


[Verse 1]
I might rap it on my raspy shit
Tell that little hoe don't ask me shit
Fruit loops in my bowl, I'm in bag little bitch
That one she my world, she a bad little bitch
So hoe don't hit my line
Why all you rappers lyin'?
Nigga are you even tryin'?
Don't make me change my mind
Don't make rewrite lines
Wanna suck my dick well get in line
I bet ya bitch she knows my sign
I mean you bitch probably knows my size
I got dick pics on my story
No screen shots that's just mandatory
You in the build but not on my story


[Hook]
Meal ticket, ticket, meal ticket, ticket, comma, uh
Steel in my liver, real hittas in my condom, huh
Chill hit me back, filled this one with a power rap
Pill bring me back, feel this one out in Saratoga
Meal ticket, ticket, meal ticket, ticket, comma, uh
Steel in my liver, real hittas in my condom, huh
Gio hit me back, filled this one with a power rap
Pill bring me back, feel this one out in Saratoga


[Verse 2]
Relyt when you gonna start tourin'
I don't think I can afford it
But I'll make these rappers start detourin'
When raise the bar up from my tourent
And get the party jumpin' just like Jordan
Michael Jackson I got moves
Black lace black suede shoes
Tom Brady when I shoot
Snake up in my boots
Red white no blue
You can live until day 2
Can't walk in my shoes for 8 mile
White boy with white noise
Still clear as day
No Ak beside my nickname
Bullets like ax aim for the body, spray


[Hook]
Meal ticket, ticket, meal ticket, ticket, comma, uh
Steel in my liver, real hittas in my condom, huh
Chill hit me back, filled this one with a power rap
Pill bring me back, feel this one out in Saratoga
Meal ticket, ticket, meal ticket, ticket, comma, uh
Steel in my liver, real hittas in my condom, huh
Gio hit me back, filled this one with a power rap
Pill bring me back, feel this one out in Saratoga
