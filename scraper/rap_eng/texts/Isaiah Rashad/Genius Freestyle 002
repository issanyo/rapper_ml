Y'all gon' shoot
I’ma smoke today
Cause me and my lil Yari
KK that's my equalizer
That's the only nigga
Like the bottle more than I do
I was riding to some Tribe
Give me dap if you high
I used to wanna be like Master P
When I was up to no good
Fuck them niggas
Talmbout they don't know me
Cause I'm covert
Tilt that motherfucker to the side when you poe up
Double me
You know I hit the tide
When you Noah
Van mission
Live to me
Cause my bitch just hit the swisha
And the lottery
Them hoes got tossed
I was cracking her jaw
My nigga say what’s good
I bring you back in the morn
4 eye
Can't see each other
What happened to me
Unwind
I'm seeing Southern
Kidnapping the Jeep
She want coke and good religion
Some Ye and Ali
Without that guilt
In my reach
I can't quit talking to me
I know that life ain’t shit but a bitch and Chatt-town nigga
