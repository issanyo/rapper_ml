[Verse 1]
Look, I'm ridin' on faith, well Delta, I hope the prayers can help us
I'm havin' no problem bein' selfish
They say God is who gon' guide ya, warrior or friend turned foe?
Who behind ya, where the knife at?
Still debatin' with the Devil for your life back
New dress, sinnin' look tempin' with a night cap
Lately I've been diggin' in her kidney cause she like that
I'll be right back, right back, right back
I got lettuce for you I got binkies and beanies and cheddar for you
I'm just talkin' to my son and my perfect woman
You might see a couple mil' if we don't kill each other
So ride with me like you love me like we feel each other
And if we lose we in the mood then don't forget each other
Sometimes the styrofoam cups is the perfect of couple
They got us runnin' from the field with a Perc' or something

[Hook]
I promise
I-I-I-I promise not to lead you astray
I promise
I promise
I remember we used to get high
I promise
I won't forget it
I promise
We used to get high
I remember
I won't forget you
I-I-I promise
These drugs do get to me

[Bridge x2]
And I could touch your soul
Look at me now look at me running

[Outro]
I promise
Yea, yea
Just to get
I wonâ€™t forget
I promise
