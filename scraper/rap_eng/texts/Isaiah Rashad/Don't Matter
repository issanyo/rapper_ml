[Intro]
Fake, fake, fake, feel me
(Hey)
Fake, fake

Fake, fake, fake, fake
(Hey, hey)

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
My shit go good with your mouth, don't it feel good?
It's a number 3, buckle up
Got to the scene it was bonafide pocket book
And 'cause you hide all my secrets from that bitch
They keep callin' your phone, I know he hate it
But the comet go
Keep us in tune and my hooker got another show
I'm on the road just to see if I can make it back
With just a scar and a carcass and a flaw
Like God and his kids
I know you hate us but it's nothin' else
They told me that I had to see it for my fuckin' self
And if I make to the gates and he don't recognize
That I had all them traits of greatness and the starlight at my feet
So don't you take me to the preacher

[Pre-Hook: Lance Skiiiwalker]
'Cause I might testify, ay
Baby today
I might testify someday
Get it on my way
And I'm just a boy

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad]
Alright pimps, hoes, fingertips, masturbate
Alright pimps, hoes, fingertips, masturbate
Alright pimps, hoes, fingertips, masturbate
Alright pimps, hoes, haha, yeah

[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad]
And I ain't done with your mouth
Say that as good as a number 3
Want some more? you got away with the tongue-in-cheek
Never seen, I know the code to your body
And the road to the vision is all communication
And we bust a nut
I left a stain in your inner part
You let it grow
I know the words to your favorite and your everything
But I don't have time for you baby
I am all for the profit, I'm past my self-destruction
But you bring it back
I got a line for you waitin' in my Cadillac
'Cause you describe all the symptoms of a common fiend
You said you read to the fire
It was good with the preacher and all the congregation
Would you testify?

[Bridge: Isaiah Rashad, Isaiah Rashad & Lance Skiiwalker]
I guess he at it again like
I guess he at it again like
I guess he at it again like
Let me put your knees to your chest and get ready
Let me put your knees to your chest and get ready

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad]
Alright pimps, hoes, fingertips, masturbate
Alright pimps, hoes, fingertips, masturbate
Alright pimps, hoes, fingertips, masturbate
Alright pimps, hoes, pimps, pimps, pimps, ah

[Outro]
Huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh
Everybody's invited
