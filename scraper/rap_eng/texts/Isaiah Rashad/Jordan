[Verse 1: Michael Da Vinci]
Yall niggas talking that gangsta shit
None of yall niggas near gangsta rich
Back to the crib wit my gangsta bitch
Why you throw me like that, her favorite
Know a couple lil niggas who dangerous
Know a couple lil niggas who savage lit
You a boosted fed, free booster, man
Fuck them other niggas like Uncle Sam
And fuck them other niggas cuz we shine on them
No limit wit my soldiers cuz I ride for them
They mad, they dont wanna see murder
Get up on your beat and I'll merk ya ass
Ya bitch love the way I start the beat all fast
Then slow it down, its effortless
It's the House muthafucka til the deferment
My niggas Detroit, yall pistol-less
Devil, red wings no hockey tip
Push the House, you get it take ya bitch
Fourth quarter, Michael Jefferies
Cuz Michael don't play when it comes to this
Them raps that they rappin' like they be on anthems
And niggas is actors like talkin they shit
Lil homie get bars, before you get balled
And step ya weak ass up to Michael da Vinci

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad]
These hoes call me young sporty
Step up and get ya bitch fucked
I dont give shit about pissin, I came to a grip that
Yo son came out lookin like us
Niggas throw me on a beat and my syllables twist
I hopped in my ride and I'm chucking your disc
I left wit the house and I came in your bitch
Ain't talkin bout shit, you just pumpin your fist
These hoes wanna swallow my babies
These niggas tryna ride my dick
Don't try to give me advice I got soda you like
And yo cosign ain't bringing you shit
Niggas tryna ride this wave, fuck em
I send my love in bundles
Give no fucks about how fuckin good you can rap
Your verse ain't bringing me numbers

[Verse 3: Rikki Blu]
Yeah this that Texas trill, that Texas trill
Triple D that Texas trill
I bet she bust it for the house on half a pill
And you swearing that you thuggin but you ain't foreal
You tryna bust a ceil, I'm tryna cop a pill
M&M's wit the blue and yellow purple hills
Throwin niggas out the crib like Uncle Phil
This is not a drill, so get me back and the track cuz them racks
At the trap double black out the tech
Guarantee these niggas won't hold me back
Boy you think you hard cuz you came wit a strap
Well rat-tat-tat-tat we ended outlet
I entered that smash my foot on the gas, I'm grippin that ass
I'm rippin this track, It's easy as that
I'm Jordan wit raps, these niggas ain't whack, The House it's a wrap
But back to trap wit the pack I go
You rappin bout rappin its whack and they clappin
Pause, what the fuck is wrong wit yall
They laced up the hoop, we came here to ball
I'm fuckin that bitch, you slipped in them draws
I'm grinnin and shit, you simpin and shit
You textin that bitch, she sucked on my dick
Fucked wit the clique on the house in the flick
Yo bitch rockin my jersey and my music all in her iPhone
I don't see how thats yo main bitch, if yo main bitch is my side hoe
And my grind slow but I'mma shine hoe
And what you think about me dont matter, why
Cuz you don't fix the food on my platter, I
Climb to the top and keep the ladder, why
I'm sicker than droppin 38 wit a fever man
Im meaner than, the leader and all of the believers man

[Hook]
I'm ballin
Aye bitch I'm ballin
Say bitch I'm ballin
Aye bitch I'm ballin
Say bitch I'm ballin
Say bitch I'm ballin
Say bitch I'm ballin
