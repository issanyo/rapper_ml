[Intro]
Go back the way you came
Wrong way uh, if you stay
Prepare to have yo' shit rearranged
The way, I say

[Verse 1]
Where gold niggas spoon whipping over Pyrex
And brown skin acute spineless
With two kids, hood-minded
See adolescents fall victim to the mindless
Yeah, so baby-sitters, if you love us
And never pet the piggies, hide the chickens in the covers
See that's the family stones and drop jewels
That's the only way the family love us
My momma water whipping while my daddy in a jail
Cause fast life look better than a J-O
And don't this feel like '95 nigga?
A drive-by killed 5 niggas
So what you doing with your life nigga?
And I reply, "Getting high, nigga"
An introduction to the hopeless
Generations passed down to the dope biz

[Outro]
Like I ain't got no, no crazy-ass, cliche-ass, you know what I'm saying? One of those stories. One of those hip-hop stories coming from, you know what I'm saying, the struggle. We was in the hood but, you know what I'm saying? My momma never...she always got me what I, what I needed, she always provided for me even when my dad didn't. You know I had a pops, even when my dad wasn't always around, I always had a pops, so I don't know man, I always said I was gonna do this so I guess I'm tryna actually do it and I have fell in love with this shit man, I just love this shit

[Coinciding w/ Outro]
You better go back the way you came
Wrong way
If you stay
Prepare to have your shit rearranged
The way
I say
You better get on away from here
You gon see
It’s gon be some
Slow singing
And flower bringing
If my burglar alarm start
You don’t wanna fall in love with me
