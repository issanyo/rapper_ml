[Intro]
This life I live like, baby don't drink like
Baby don't think too much, don't drive
How I got here, I can't even

[Hook]
This life I live like, baby don't drink like
Baby don't think too much, don't drive
How I got here, I can't even tell my nigga
Ain't a damn thing parked outside
Size my cup, nigga I'm Gucci
'Sides my hair, nigga I'm Boosie
Nigga burnt out, can't even catch fire no more
Figured it was just a West Side movie

[Post-Hook]
But thank God I got my bank, where I keep my heart inside
And I keep it far away from all these hoes and flashin' lights
I'm like Granny with the whip, I'm not Oprah with these hoes
And I keep a snoopy barbie because it keep me on my toes

[Verse 1]
We been ridin' for ten exits and I still been in your throat
We get better by the steps so if I ever let you go
Baby you classy, baby you got it
Baby you ain't really 'spossed to do the whole thing
Bitch too smart, got lost just fuckin' with a nigga
Got tossed cause a nigga couldn't think

[Hook]
This life I live like, baby don't drink like
Baby don't think too much, don't drive
How I got here, I can't even tell my nigga
Ain't a damn thing parked outside
Size my cup, nigga I'm Gucci
'Sides my hair, nigga I'm Boosie
Nigga burnt out, can't even catch fire no more
Figured it was just a West Side movie

[Verse 2]
I was pillin' in the back, I was chillin' in the back
Cause I always really wanna be that nigga in the back
You don't live it with me, I can't show you how to live
But I promise I can show a pussy nigga how to act
Junked out smokin' from the side door
With a bitch I wanted in the eighth grade
Hope you got an ass like Nori
Hope you pussy niggas never see me
This is why I never want a feature
Cause I can tell you bitches got a limit
I can be subjective 'bout you fuckin' up the highway
You fuckin' up the ride, why you fuckin' up the heist?
I remember lookin' from the outside
I remember workin' after work late
I remember nigga havin' nothin' but my momma
And some starter on my mothafuckin' birthday, birthday
Baby can I live it like I bought it?
Let my momma smoke it â€˜til she finish
Let a nigga sip it all alone babe
It done been a long day, it done been a hard $10.30
All my niggas tell me that they want it
Hope I see my niggas at the finish
Let a nigga sip it all alone babe
It done been a long day, it done been a hard $10.30

[Hook]
This life I live like, baby don't drink like
Baby don't think too much, don't drive
How I got here, I can't even tell my nigga
Ain't a damn thing parked outside
Size my cup, nigga I'm Gucci
'Sides my hair, nigga I'm Boosie
Nigga burnt out, can't even catch fire no more
Figured it was just a West Side movie

[Post-Hook]
But thank God I got my bank, where I keep my heart inside
And I keep it far away from all these hoes and flashin' lights
I'm like granny with the whip, I'm not Oprah with these hoes
And I keep a snoopy barbie because it keep me on my toes

[Outro]
This life I live like, baby don't drink like
Baby don't think too much, don't drive
How I got here, I can't even tell my nigga
Ain't a damn thing parked outside
Size my cup, nigga I'm Gucci
'Sides my hair, nigga I'm Boosie
Nigga burnt out, can't even catch fire no more
Figured it was just a West Side movie
