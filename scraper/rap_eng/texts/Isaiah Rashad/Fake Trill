[Verse 1: Michael da Vinci]
The no stoner, has a boner, I need head and some sex
Sometimes vulgar, I'm quite Homer, dream 'bout booze and some tits
Speak 'bout bitches less than often cause they lie for the dick
Thus an evil of a creature, who plays games on gent
I sit lonely in my Honda, behind darkest of tint
Smoke a woodtip for my problems and give Brandy a sip
Get confided in the voice, spill my feelings and shit
Breaking codes and regulations, not a pimp nor a simp
Give me things that make me happy, cause the bottom I hit
Fuck a bowl, give me love, fuck your words, give me drugs Promethazine, a nice to meet you, you made bitch niggas all seem to
Misuse the words of trill, hold the gun so they real
'til their face in the reel, watch a real nigga squeal
When the piglets peal, the tabs off of your grill
Yeah you chirping, pleading deals with your faggot ass

[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad]
Been sipping on this, stop telling me, start to get sober
Bill Bellamy, tickle my bellilly, I would do anything just to get over
So I drank sometimes, then I paint these rhymes, pardon me, I'm antsy
Why? My heart quite nervous, '95 I'm swerving, then I hit them curbs
No then boys ain't working, fuck a black Suburban, commissary purchase
My daddy calls, I barely answer, fuck parental curses
I spit too many verses, I know you fucking heard 'em
So why you leave them voicemails that you know gone hurt me
Tired of rapping that real shit, if nobody gone feel this
I could be gripping that steel shit, you too busy to deal with
It's like, they told me all the time "You got the gift of the gab"
Finally niggas is listening, yeah, then I just start with this missing my dad

[Outro: Isaiah Rashad]
Damn, so like when... you gone quit? You trill now, huh?
You cool, huh? You real? You real, that's what's popular, huh?
That's cool, you UGK for life, huh? Boy Stop
