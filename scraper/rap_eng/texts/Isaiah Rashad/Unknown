[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]

? feeling with my smiley faces
? I ain't looking for no fucking dating
I need a ? a beamer so ? fucking crazy
Ain't got to wonder why them coppers want to run our plates
I'm from the city of the ?
? black on black ?
? chilling on the porch ?
?
Sometimes I feel like I'm the best these niggas never heard
?
? I deserve
?
See I've been riding in this bucket for too many summers
And there's too many bitches ? can't repay their mothers
I think my niggas steady gripping ? drama
? like a fucking comma


[Hook : Isaiah Rashad]
I been grinding by myself, tell my mama I been straight
Tell my bitch to have my back, and tell my money don't be late
Niggas think I'm selling base, I been in and out of state
Bitch ask me how I'm doing, I say "Hoe I'm doing great!"
