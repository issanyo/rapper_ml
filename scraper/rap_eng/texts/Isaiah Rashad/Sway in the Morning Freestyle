[Verse 1]
I'm here to talk my shit
And I ain't looking for no rival, won't stalk no bitch
Only the finest of the pussy come across my lips
I gave her my heart, then she lost my shit
One for the money, where my mom's and sis?
I should keep the monetary where my conscious is
Sorry mama, I ain't banking where my monsters live
I invested in some babies, this no condoms, yeah
Tick-tockin', ain't no mothafuckin' time to fear
I've been searchin' for my mothafuckin' prime for years
Keep a xanny in my system and my lines sincere
If them bitches came alive, bet my lines will clear
I run raps round' niggas
I don't even like to fuckin' rap round' niggas
They write, break it down, spread crack, my nigga
The 80's is back, so blame me
Sway reporting Ronald Reagan is back

[Transition]
Watching Vega on the boards
Really keeping the score
Like some guru shit, some voodoo shit
Like on black and white pictures on some-

[Verse 2]
Drop top Benz, Maybe not a Benz
Maybe it's your mom's car, look
You handing me the keys to the whip, don't crash it baby
Done planned your whole life, don't mash it baby
140 on the dash, whiplash is crazy
[?] on the scene, I mean, good grief
I think more so, I dream
I'm on another planet, god damnit
They jam me and my brothers
Got a chance to say peace up
To all my people that will hold me down till I re-up
This feeling, this, I'm feeling
I could drown-

[Verse 3]
Look into my wallet
Found some change for your life
And maybe a new car or some brain from your wife
You probably never thought of how the chains are alike
And never probably... see the dark from the light
I'm higher than a kite, while i'm riding on a bike
Through Amsterdam fields, with a head full of pills
And half of my face is numb
Pour some Neapolitan on the racist's tongue
This Chevy's a sixty-seven but the race is young
But she gives good brain but her ass is dumb
I have no one to blame, Obama nor Bush
I just need a little hug from a bag full of kush
