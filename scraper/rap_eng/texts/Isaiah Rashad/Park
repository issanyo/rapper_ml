[Verse]
Mama I knew I was 'bout it
Way before venue was crowded
Way before Kevin pulled up with that Reverend
I told him to level, go fuck on the feelings
Don't nut on her face
Trust me I feel like the man
Trust me I feel like the Wop, rock
You can depend on the stock, watch
Bitch I got ten in the pot, crock
All of my limits could die, all of y'all niggas
All of my limits could die
Look at you timid as fuck and you holding me up
And I'm trying to be Nicki Minaj
Rich as a bitch in the drop
Rich as a bitch, rich as my bitch on the side
Hoe I got more than you know, ho I got...
Look, watch, spill out your soul in the closet
Don't question your passion
We flipped that reefer 'cause we couldn't be ashing
They got me so high that I look like I'm passing
Bitch, don't you know who you asking?
Bitch, have you tutored the pastor?
I know the root and the master
I know the coupe was a casket
I had that bitch looking like all the shit that I’m writing
That shit was so good that I passed it
Bust that shit straight out the plastic
Bitch, I ain’t good, bitch, I’m crafty
I wanna piss on a rapper
I just got hookers and pampers
Niggas line up when I practice
I’m not a savage, I don’t do shit just to do it
This going precise as we planned it
I'm just a bandit, plus I'm as sharp as a tack
Or a guillotine right at your family
Keep it so candid, knock ya like sheets and some candy
You down for this shit? Are you Brandy?
Find a mechanic, tell 'em I pay 'em in fabric
3500 in traffic

[Hook]
Nigga I'm savvy
I look more Cuban than Maverick
The metal, the tube or the handle
Nigga I'm savvy, wait (hey)
Wait, look, nigga I'm savvy
I look more Cuban than Maverick
The metal, the tube or the handle
Nigga I'm savvy, I look more Cuban than Maverick
The metal, the tube or the handle
Nigga I'm swagging
Bitch I might shoot at your camera
Bitch I might shoot at your camera
Nigga what's happening?
Niggas want piss on your grave
Bitch I might piss on your family
Nigga what's happening?
Bitch I might shoot at your camera
Bitch I might shoot at your
Nigga what's happening?
I look more Cuban than Maverick
The metal, the tube or the handle
Nigga I'm savvy

[Outro]
Back-back, to the back-back
To the frozens and the BB's
Way before ya, way before ya
Thought I told ya, it's a lot on the line
These hoes, want a lot on the line
These hoes, ain't no bible of mine
Back-back, to the back-back
To the frozens and the BB's
If sixteen ain't enough
I could swing in twenty-five
I could tell ya how to go
I could tell you where to ride
I could tell you where the
If sixteen ain't enough
