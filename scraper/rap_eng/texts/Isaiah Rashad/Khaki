[Verse 1]
Far from a nigga, don't call me a nigga 'less you call me my nigga
I love niggas, I'm your only white friend
I bet you hate your own complexion, bet you wish you light skin
I dream a dream and write 'em like right then I bet you dreamed 'em before
But it's the hesitant the fear of all the shit you don't know
My momma told me not to listen to them bitches no more
And ever since I've been riding in my Honda solo, 4-door, it's kinda busted
It get me to my girlfriend house so I can bust it, I see potential
I feel it in my soul, kinda bitter with my father, tryna let that shit go
But I don't know

[Hook]
I wanna smoke the pain away but the weed'll get me fired
From a job that I need, where's the weed? (Man, fuck it)

[Verse 2]
I ain't tryna change the world, I just wanna change my own life
And transition a couple wrongs right, up
One of them long nights, contemplated suicide
In the mirror you and I, it's do or die
I love my poppa man
Them niggas without a father, hope the chopper jam
Big brothers and single mothers put they kids first
Bang bang, whoopty-whoop guess who was hit first, khaki
Bitch
