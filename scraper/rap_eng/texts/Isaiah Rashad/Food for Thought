[Intro]
I was singing my song for nobody

[Verse 1: TUT]
I'm like a Rolling Stone rolling stone
And I'm the shit playa, but don't flush your commode
And I hope you smell me, but this Polo cologne
Slamming doors like I got an attitude or something wrong
It's like I'm switching cars the way I them holding on the
Every word I spit like I got a lisp and it is hella strong
Kicks like they came to play this off a house party
And you niggas look gay, like Jesse McCartney
It to be real it wouldn't be logic to fuck with me
Cause we on some Adele shit, we be rolling deep
Your girl get mad when I pass and I don't even speak
Prolly cause I got all up inside and was behind her teeth
I need a piece of at least if I can get the whole cake
Cause I be going all in like a young Drake
Yeah, you probably didn't get that like money
Yeah, you probably didn't get that
Imma keep it real cause some liars don't do that
And Imma blow cause I've seen a fucking fire do that
And Imma take a trick magicians be like how he do that?
And I be killing beats rappers be like why he do that?
Bitches say I'm clean and I don't even try to dress
I could fuck her though but I ain't even tryna sex
I got her number man and I ain't even tryna text
I strong armed dude and I ain't gotta flex
I spit profound shit that I could never lose
And I was better than half these dudes back in middle school
And I remember days like this
Tapping out the whole world with a pen in my wrist
Freestyling in class I bet the teacher was pissed
I probably should've paid more attention, yeah i'm slick
But bitch I probably won't be like this no more
I thunk outside the box and they won't let me back in that ho
Damn..

[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad]
Yeah
Lounging with my feet up
Them lame motherfuckers drop their faces when they see us
We could play pretend them niggas still couldn't be us
Back in Chattanooga still couldn't Tennessee us
It's conflict when I'm writing these rhymes
Tryna fit my whole life up in thirty two lines but
I keep it real that's how it happened
The government gonna try to do me in like Fred Hampton, a black panther
Let's keep it real from the Hamptons
A penny saving, minimum wage is some shit, plantation
Slaves to the modern day, swimming Frank Ocean
Guns waving guns blazing filling in the holster
All I need is some cake like a fuckin' Hostess
At a table can't eat, grab a fuckin' hostess
Put my back against the wall like a fuckin' poster
Put my money on the table like a fuckin' coaster
Who's better? You's better? That's fuckin' bogus
I got your bitch up in my sheets like a fuckin' toga
Positions in some shit, sexual yoga
Master of that pussy, sexual Yoda
Jedi mind tricks watch that nine dip
That's food for thoughts, 9 clips

[Verse 3: Amazn]
Yeah
All I need in this life is a bitch and a blunt
Good head and cooked food is all a nigga want
I don't trust too many niggas so my circle small
Never let 'em hear my feelings only pussy involved
I know it's kinda cold but the fuck is you to judge me
The last time I fell in love man I damn near lost me
So I spit my feelings in these raps to get my feelings back
Cause lately I been feeling lost stranded like I need map
Tired of the bullshit so I need a nap
I'm hungry for this music shit so I'm eating tracks
Flow hotter than anniversary candle wax
I'm feeling sorry for the competition cause they lack
Originality, imagine they shittin style
I'm looking like a vet and you been at this for awhile
21 years old, nigga no pressure
I cop your bitch with ease dog, I'm talking no effort
Don't be mad at me, bruh, cause she chose greatness
It was long overdue cause you kept her waiting
She fell in love with my poetic flow and way with words
All this time you playing daddy but the kid ain't even yours
