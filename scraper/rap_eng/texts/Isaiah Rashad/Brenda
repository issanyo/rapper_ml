[Intro]
Uh, uhm, yeah, uh-huh
Uhm, yeah, uhm, this a room

[Hook]
I got two cigarettes to my last name
I clock in for the check but I don't wanna go
I got two cigarettes to my last name
I clock in for the check but I don't wanna go
She said you, you can't save em all
She said you, you can't save em all, yeah
She said you, you can't save em all, yeah

[Verse 1]
I mix a gallon of the gallon in a gallon of that
And down that in your Nissan for the memory
For the energy, for the Tennessee
Fam call work, off work just to visit me
I bought an ounce just to fuck with you
He don't take no hand outs, he don't take no hand outs
Remember what my poppa told me
Remember what my poppa told me
Trust inward, trust in ya, my n-word, my friend of
Last of the divine livin', so timid, all on us, doggone it
They would laugh at the small moments, then call on us
Like who had you on your bad days?
Who dropped you at that bitch house?
Like, like back when we was little
I was just an instrumental, now I'm Malcolm in a million
We talked about a billion, we talked about our feelin's
We kept it more than realest
And look at how the path came, took it for the rap fam
Would ya give ya all to the world, the work, work, and left hurt?
Shit, and what's worse
She too tired to talk, lately your thumbs hurt
We miss love and sex, Bridget, your son's birth
21 hurts in court by 24, boy

[Bridge]
You can't save 'em all
She said you, you-you, you can't save 'em all, um
She said you, you-you, you can't save 'em all, um

[Verse 2]
I write piss test livin', fuck that shit
Fuck call centers, fuck is this really growin' up my nigga?
Tax on your motherfuckin' nuts my nigga
$10.25 what the fuck can a nigga do with $10.25?
Plus your weed habit plus my weed habit and your weave habit
For free givin' we livin' with a weed daddy, two kids
Mix that Boosie with that boom-bap
You rap like you need money like you don't love this
My shit shoot up your jury before you judged this
Pull out, look at my dick like ain't it gorgeous
For those that can't afford this
It be like I got, I got
I got my own world, I got my own mind
Day dreamin' for a lunch break for my son's sake
On the run for the funds sake

[Outro]
I clock in for the check but I don't wanna go
It ain't that hard, I got two cigarettes to my last name
I clock in for the check but I don't wanna go
You, you can't save em all
