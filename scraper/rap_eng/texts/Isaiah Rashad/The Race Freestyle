[Verse]
Yeah, this for free, you been tryna get a plate (free lunch)
You ain't smokin', you just lookin' for an 8th (uh uh)
How you ballin' if you ain't got the skates? (Ain't got the skates)
I've been nuttin' on this bitch from the Bay (from the Bay)
Sellin' out, bring my friends, you my dawg (my dawg)
Fill my fronto like an arm in the cigar (the cigar)
If I don't smoke before I eat then I'ma starve (then I'ma starve)
I throw that platinum on my teeth when I'm with y'all
Preacher man, Mr. Willie, put some hands on my dinner
Put some eyes in my back, let me scope out these niggas
You a nobody, ain't nobody to nobody, nigga
I'ma quit when a bitch suck the flow out a nigga, uh
What's the word? I'm just tryna get a zip (amen)
But your plug always talkin' out my ear (amen)
At the window tryna hop up in the VIP (amen)
Swear you niggas be more thirsty than your bitch
Broke hoes always tryna tell me what I should do
With this change that I make and this groove that I grew
This your broad on the phone, this that raw on the phone
It's expensive and tucked, what's the brand? I don't know
Ain't concerned with that shit, too concerned with this grip
L.A. bitches only wanna sniff the coke off the tip
We can chill, you can hang like a rope off the dick
Celebrate, bring up dope, bring some pour out this bitch

[Chorus]
Fuck a bond, I'm just tryna get some face (amen)
Soon as I beat the face, bitch I did the race (amen)
Bust a nut, then I go out my way (go out my way)
Get the guap, then I go out my way (go out my way)

[Outro]
Yeah, go out my
Amen, ayy
See how I picked up the headphone jack and just kept goin'?
