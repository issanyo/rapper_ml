[Intro: Kirk Collins]
Load... *chuckles*
That's my new shit, niggas ain't say that shit
So now I know, if a motherfucker say that shit, if a nigga come on his track like, "LOAD!"
*laughs*

WE KNOW WHERE YOU GOT THAT SHIT FROM!

[Hook: Kirk Collins]
If I die today, it don't matter bruh
Same way
If I get this cake, it don't matter bruh

If I die today, it don't matter bruh
Same way
If I get this cake, it don't matter bruh

[Verse 1: Kirk Collins]
Motivated my niggas
Multiplied my hustle
I could die in the struggle
But I'm never gone stop
Got my shit to the top
You little niggas some muggles
Am I still speaking English?
Cause your shit a Façade!
Ever since Yogi Bahjan
My chakras been on
In my Sade tee
Feeling fresh as the sun
If I died today
Just keep my mama straight
Keep my sister in BAPE
And don't you tell her no lies!
Make sure my bitches straight
Keep my favorite in Chanel
And make her cum everyday
But only if I die today!
Aye, If I die today
I'm the realist Alive
I ain't living a lie
Bitch, I'm living alive

"Live" (Echoes)

[Hook: Kirk Collins]
If I die today, it don't matter bruh
Same way
If I get this cake, it don't matter bruh

If I die today, it don't matter bruh
Same way
If I get this cake, it don't matter bruh

[Verse 2: Kirk Collins]
Even if I died
Nigga we won't die!
Say it one time
Flip it one time
This that wonton
Don Juan
Shawty with me
Looks could kill
Let me feel
New flow
Line for line
What's it man
Feeling grand
50 grand
That's my mans, 50 grand
Worth a hundred grand
Damn man
Them them, yeah
Came to win
Winning, winning rings
All of Charlotte fucking winning, *bling*
Niggas popping bottles, all them things
Cop a Telly, fill it up with tings
I get jolly, Hit the road
You just rolled with a rose
I just rolled on the road
Bout this dough, Bout this dough

[Hook: Kirk Collins]
If I die today, it don't matter bruh

If I get this cake, it don't matter bruh

If I die today, it don't matter bruh
Same way
If I get this cake, it don't matter bruh

[Outro: Kirk Collins]
If I die today
I'm just saying, you should think, raise your fucking mind.. *fades*
