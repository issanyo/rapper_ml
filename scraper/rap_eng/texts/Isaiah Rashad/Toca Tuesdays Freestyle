[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
The sun has risen when I wake up, we racin' for the sake of
Can I get the motherfucking condo in the place of
Duplexes, new ex's, what are you stressin'?
I'm on baby [?], fuck a job, twenty two stressing
Just tell a bitch to suck my dick and love it
See momma taught me never spoil a puppet
Just know the road is rugged
And I ain't scared to tell a bitch I ain't shit
It was vivid in them [?] bricks, them niggas chokin' and ain't even that sick
This feel foul, they [??] shit
Niggas thought I would quit, like, Fuck
Them niggas thought I was them, boy
Get off the tip boy you all on the brim
Look, Chattanooga story, go biography them
They'll kill the school then we slaughterin' them
And if I tell the truth and I author again
Yawk, Yawk, send shots, am I botherin' them?
Look, follow your feet, follow your soul
Hollow as he, shallow as old
I pray for peace, then out of the door
One with the street, and one with the soul
Huggin' the creek, but roamin' the road
One with the beast

[Break]

[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad]
I be askin' like
So who the fuck is you?
I'm the mothafuckin' prince, I'm the fuckin' true
I've seen visions of a Benz in my bucket too
Ghetto fabulous, stylin' up in them Sketchers too
Highly doubted, didn't want me now I'm on the news
And teachers said I'm a dreamer cause I slept in school
I really mean it, you can suck my dick
The whole base, the nuts, your whole face
I prefer the slow pace
Baby don't you tease me
Baby please me, the world needs me
At least do it easy
News never tell stories of the greasy
Grimy, Chattanooga, a body, never find it
You might Tivo Oprah
And she'll mention water, missions
I know niggas missin' dishes
Never had them, never dad and never taught 'em right or wrong
Never how to write a song
Gucci like a father now
I depend on bottle now
True love will swallow down
Might grab a hollow now
(laughs)
Blat, blat, blat, blat, you innocent
From my perspective jiggin' you was just a benefit
I need mils, at minimum I need ten of 'em
I pray my lyrics inspire you and they offendin' them
So when you hear me reciting them $pottie grinnin' then
I keep my focus on money and corner bendin' them, bitch
