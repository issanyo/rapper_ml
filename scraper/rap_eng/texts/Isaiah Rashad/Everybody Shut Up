[Intro: Jesse Boykins III]
Me tell da gal dem me say
Don't bother with dem ya know
Just follow your heart and your mind will follow still
Just cool ya self na man
Just relax and live ya life ya know

[Verse 1: Jesse Boykins III]
Chakras and chasers, lost in-between two worlds
New age Cinderella, Buddha as a girl
Peer pressure to princess
Success equals plastic tings
They keep shaming beauty
All she chase is the American dream

[Chorus: Jesse Boykins III]
Sometimes she knows
Sometimes she don't
In here is they castle
In mine they lost it
In her they lost it
Alone as a treasure
Them days don't forget her
Them days don't forget her
Them days don't forget her
So, so, everybody in the room shut up
Everybody in the room shut up, shut up
Everybody in the room shut up
Everybody in the room shut up, shut up
All she really wanna do is grow up
All she really wanna do is grow up, grow up
So, everybody in the room shut up
Everybody shut up, shut up

[Verse 2: Jesse Boykins III]
Conquest of the forest
In search of a fallen star
Libras and the Aires
They breath deep and hold they hearts
Berlin train to Paris
The water don't taste the same
As long as she love she
The noise will never ever remains

[Chorus: Jesse Boykins III]
Sometimes she knows
Sometimes she don't
In here is they castle
In mine they lost it
In her they lost it
Alone as a treasure
Them days don't forget her
Them days don't forget her
Them days don't forget her
So, so, everybody in the room shut up
Everybody in the room shut up, shut up
Everybody in the room shut up
Everybody in the room shut up, shut up
All she really wanna do is grow up
All she really wanna do is grow up, grow up
So, everybody in the room shut up
Everybody shut up, shut up

[Verse 3: Isaiah Rashad]
You smell like blossoms and shopping, you got your own now
You had a long day
I heard your mirror suicidal
Why you? Why you? Why you?
I heard your mirror suicidal
Why you? Why you? Why you?
You smell like blossoms and shopping, you got your own now
You had a long day
I heard your mirror suicidal
Why you? Why you? Why you?
I heard your mirror suicidal
Why you? Why you? Why you?

[Outro]
(When you look in the mirror)
Me say
(I hope you see love)
A wise man one time him tell me, him say
(When you look in the mirror)
The only true love is self love ya know
(I hope you feel love)
You can't love nobody if you don't love yourself still
(When you look in the mirror)
So make sure you love yourself ya know
(I hope you know love)
Make sure your heart in the right place then
(When you look in the mirror)
You see me?
(I hope you feel loved)
So lovely just go on and live your life now
And tell dem fi shut up
