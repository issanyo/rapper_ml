[Verse 1]
I've been smoking and drinking, now I am drinking and driving
Suicide on my mind but at least I got my pride right
Tryna hit up Bree cause at least she get my mind right
Speeding through traffic was that a stop sign-lights flashing, seem like magic
Blue and red inspiration reaching for the masses
Life is do or die and Ima die making classics
They killing me with books, cafeterias and classes, and I be like
"Lord I ain't your best son and man on that liquor I confess some"
My soul get the weakest when the flesh come
Religious ass bitches, just praying I undress 'em
I got a problem with my pops should I talk about it?
Relationships get tore was you off about it
You saying these A&Rs ain't shit just looking for a bitch
That can spit a few hits should i bark about it
Its like I am aiming at myself young Plaxico
My soul hurts ain't never felt regret before
Me and this bitch ain't never ever met before
I am cheating but pussy ain't never ever felt this wet before
Lord should I let it go in poverty but the change is blinding
Somewhere in between the fame and insane asylums
Charlie Sheening on that bitch, still dreaming of that shit
They praying that a nigga fucking Willie Beamen on that shit (Fame)
Four blunts is this as high as we can get
I spit my soul and pay the toll and let my momma play it
For her friends, she bragging about a Benz, that I can't buy, but eventually
Get that thang right and treat me like Zack Morris up in Bayside
I kill the vocals, kill the beat, and let the bass ride

[Hook]
Let me sing my song, I free my soul, I free my soul
So let me, le...let me free my soul, I sing my song, I free my...
