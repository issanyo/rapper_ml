[Verse 1]
I take a drag at the square, I feel anxious, spit dangerous
As the verbal appears, it's reflecting my perspective
Beer goggle and fear, role model so hollow
Shadow adolescence and a gaggle of them bitches
Road to the riches still paved with the ditches
Get caught up in the hype, your career is for a night
I ain't these other niggas, cause these niggas is fake
They ain't popping shot, these niggas is Papa Doc
Fine as the shine, beam me up, and Iâ€™m riding Spock
No crying 'til I'm in a pine box
I got the bitches hitting Mikey like where Zay at?
Probably fucking on her friend, probably L.A. at
Probably plotting on a mil', staying well fed
Bitch don't run your mouth, we don't play that
Momma taught me better, can't count on niggas
Can't count on weather, go figure nigga
They ain't worried 'bout this cheddar
Them niggas just sky diving in my propellers, I don't feel 'em
Ain't tryna be no freshman, I'm chilling
Cause they'll bring a knife to the fight, and I'll kill 'em
Me and my niggas is hungry, we're willing
To bring a little ho to the party and Meek Mill 'em
I feel like talking my shit
Come in the house, acting friendly, you can suck my dick!

[Bridge]
I'm praying for some good rappers and a fleetwood
Why I gotta bring my A game? You just D goods
We don't wanna hear that weak shit, nigga speak up
Rocking old flows corn rows and a beeper
You niggas hoes, you niggas hoes and I ain't even tripping
Cause we'll be laughing to the bank and riding by these niggas
Mikey bring that mink with your low body Bentley
Put the hood in the fucking trunk and bring the party with me

[Hook]
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
Your brain no have no conscious, what you do now?
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
I bang, I bang, I blocka, what you do now?
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No sensitive niggas, I shot you down
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No Hypebeast pussies, what you do now?

[Outro]
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
Your brain no have no conscious, don't make a sound
I came, I saw, I conquered, what you do now?
Your brain no have no conscious, what you do?
Don't make a sound, bitch
