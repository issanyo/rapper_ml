[Produced by Flying Lotus]

[Verse 1]
Two pills and a Mac-11, red, blue, you choose
Tryna spit a few flows to get my money up
Look I'm 20 years old and I ain't done enough
And 'til the sun set, roll another blunt for my real nigga Kembe
I'm not only the leader but I follow the village
I swear them niggas is killing it in Chicago
Now put the gun down, waiting to put the world on 'em
I get tired of the problems and depression
The bitches and the bitching, come and get your girl, homie
Shallow dreams and broken hearts,  Black Benz's
They're tryna make, material wishes and spiritual blisses
They stay focused on inferior pictures, you got your mothafuckin' hands out

[Hook]
I hid so, so far away, so far away
But I still, I still hear the gun sounds
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang

[Verse 2]
Two kills from a Mac-11, red and blue, you lose
A nigga need bail so get your money out
I'm twenty years old and I ain't done enough
Lord, I swear I got the answers for my people, and bullets bring the reaper
I heard my first lie in a church from a preacher
I sank low cause that's where they want to keep us
Just give me love, give me sex, give me reefer
And after school getting high with the teachers
I tried to promise my momma I'd make it honest
Say what's on your heart I promise they call it conscience
And conscious don't make no dollars, no dollars unless you Common
Now get your mothafuckin' hands out

[Hook]
I hid so, so far away, so far away
But I still, I still hear the gun sounds
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang

[Outro]
I hid so, so far away, so far away
But I still, I still hear the gun sounds
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
