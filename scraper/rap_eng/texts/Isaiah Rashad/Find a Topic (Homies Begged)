[Intro]
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
Hey

[Verse 1]
I can make a dope fiend of you yet if I could find ya
I just like a freak hoe for the nostalgia (yeah)
Non my heart can't break no more
I can't even feel the papercuts
Let me see my son and let me ball, let me ball, yeah
Measure twice, cut once
Fucked up on that other night
And the kids got me high enough to touch the rim
As a kid that's the only thing I wanted then
Yeah, I feel like Mikey D
Lord I guess I gotta take my words back
Merge with me Henny, light hurt, I got 25 plus a few
This might be the zip or the shit or another clue
I got what you need, what you don't, what you never knew

[Interlude]
Yeah, skin and bones, you are my favorite type
Yeah, oh, skin and bones, you are my favorite type

[Hook]
You, yeah, you my favorite topic
Yeah, money, fuckin' love it
You, you my favorite topic
You, money, fuckin' love it
Yeah, you my favorite topic
Yeah, money, fuckin' love it, yeah
Yeah, you my favorite topic
Yeah, money, fuckin'

[Verse 2]
I guess we back to talkin' shit again, very riveting
Do you love me for the benefits? Finish this
Tell me what you need, what you like, what you never did
Tell me on your knees, say it right, fix your upper lip
You just head boppin' cause I said bop it
You like Jean Robins with them bean poppers
And them lean stockers
That don't mean shit but they cool when you need somethin'
Always need somethin', more fees, more of these suckers
I'm a tree hugger, quarter p 'fore I eat somethin'
Keep your fees covered, play it safe, fuck with me, puppet
That was me truckin' overseas, cool as Al Bundy
For the slouch of 'em in the house and my cows comin' home

[Hook]
Yeah, you my favorite topic
Yeah, money, fuckin' love it
Yeah, you my favorite topic
Yeah, money, fuckin' love it

[Outro]
You my favorite topic
You my, you my favorite
You my... this a padded room
