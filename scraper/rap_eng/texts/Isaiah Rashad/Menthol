[Verse 1]
She so fuckable, and she got the menthol
And Tunji brought the trees that turned my trousers into cement drawls
Sleeping on couches, only vouchers is my in-laws
He sold ten ounces, one verse is like an eight ball
Look, I seen it crystal clear, I seen a pistol near
Seen it cock back and knock caps like it's senior year
These niggas think I give a fuck, I could drink a beer
Read a magazine, hut, hut, pass interference
I've been riding clean in my bucket for a couple years
I've been pre-stressed Lawrence Pucket, mothafucka, yeah
Baby hold my hand while I stumble up these fucking stairs
Know your nigga here, you still suckin', why you fucking scared?
And hoes love it when I'm high off life, cause she know
I'm getting faded, I could fuck all night
Y'all too busy popping Mollys, you could die off hype
My favorite rapper popping ollies and he rap all dyke, I know it

[Hook: Jean Deaux]
I had a couple drinks, and I wonder
If I could call you, tomorrow and borrow, your heart
See I've been stressing for a blessing
The one that would set me apart, set me apart
I got all my problems, but I no have no weed
When they say money solve 'em, I say "No, not me"
And I don't love no more, but I'll just let you be
Cause you see all my problems and you still had loved me

[Verse 2]
You cut your hair about as short as your temper, the prescription
For dementia, start slipping an elixirs make it hard to remember
As I recall it with your heart in a blender, drinks spiking
Still chilling, put your life on ice and sink like me
Actions of us, lacking the passion, but think
Righteous from pussy upon a tongue, to calling a hymn or something
Thought the remedy was balling, I'm falling darling I'm done
Finna to be a workaholic, an alcoholic or somethin', I'm just calling baby

[Hook]
I had a couple drinks, and I wonder
If I could call you, tomorrow and borrow, your heart
See I've been stressing for a blessing
The one that would set me apart, set me apart
