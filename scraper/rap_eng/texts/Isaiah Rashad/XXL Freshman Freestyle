[Verse]
Baby hold my chalice, this some pimp shit
This that stay over with my daddy and his mistress
I could drink hundred proof a gallon, fuck a kidney
Fuck with me, I just want some balance and some bitches
Fuck a dream, I say anything is realistic
I see a challenge Imma gun it down like it offend me
I suppose, Lordy take my vision off the pussy hole
Few are chose, God I wanna say it, but they took it wrong
Back the hoes, can I change the world with Cadillacs and Volks?
Can I breed it like we need it like we back to back we bought?
I don't want my child to grow up feeling like his daddy gone
Daddy left, feeling just like me I'm waiting on your steps
What is blessed?
How I end up rapping, how we feeling stressed?
Shit I'm back to burgers in the locals if you ain't impressed
I need motivation, all I'm asking is you bring your best
Rain is just another confrontation, know that life a bitch
Life is this
