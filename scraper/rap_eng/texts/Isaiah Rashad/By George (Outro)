[Pre-Hook: Isaiah Rashad]
Hop on the road and say
That it was live last night
I know the world can wait

[Hook]
We don't usually take that long
I gotta, gotta new me, yeah
TV shows
We ain't that far from home
I used to coulda, woulda, shoulda
If I want it you be waitin' till the mornin' for real

[Bridge]
Cause then she told me I'm a light weight
This ain't love low tide
You love lo-los
Hurt in your eyes singing your song
Like

[Hook]
We don't usually take that long
I gotta, gotta new me, yeah
TV shows
We ain't that far from home
I used to coulda, woulda, shoulda
If I want it you be waitin' till the mornin' for real

[Pre-Hook: Isaiah Rashad]
Hop on the road and say
That it was live last night
I know the world can wait
I ain't been there in so long
You take me back to '99
I ain't been there in so long
You take me back to '99
I ain't been there in so long
You take me back to '99

[Verse]
I heard the moon ainâ€™t got no service
But your mama got some cable
Tell me would you steal it from her?
I run away, I run away, it ain't nothin' on the TV
Baby tell me what you stealin' from
I tried to get to know you
Like lies and matrimony
I heard the moon ain't got no service
But your mama got some cable
Tell me would you steal it from her?

[Interlude]
Is it okay to come down sometimes?
Wow it's so good comin' down

[Hook]
We don't usually take that long
I gotta, gotta new me, yeah
We don't usually take that long
I gotta, gotta new me, yeah
