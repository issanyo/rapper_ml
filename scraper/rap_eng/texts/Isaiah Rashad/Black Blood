[Intro: Kent Jamz]
Hands on the table, oooh yeah
You killed my uncle back in '83
Guns on the table, oooh yeah
They killed my daddy back in '93

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
I seen too much and I'm just 23
I know some killaz born in '96
I'll take you back, I'll teach you how to swim
I reminisce, I remi-
I reminisce like I was 85
Beyond your dollar sign and your skin
I reminisce, I remi-, I reminisce, I-
I know ya, I know ya hurt
I know ya love me, I know the pain, it breaks my heart
I know you love me, I know you hurt some
I know what love is, I know ya

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad & Kent Jamz]
I know the black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto
Black love, keep the sunshine, on your face, I know
Black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto
Black love, black love
Black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto (I know)
Black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto (I know)
Black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto
Black blood (black blood), I know (I know)

[Verse 2: King Los]
They killed my pop when I was just sixteen (Oh no no)
They took my innocence away from me (No no no)
In my hood I done did some crazy things (Oh no no)
But that's all the shit that made me a king (No no no)
Cause I still see the sun rise, and the moon shine
I look in my son's eyes, and I'm grateful two times
And two types of niggas where I'm from, and they both the same
Know yourself, know the streets, know the game, know the pain
Novocain make me numb, know the chains make me dumb
Chain me to my brother, hate each other 'til we eighty something
Make me run from myself, this like my own flesh
So we on bullshit, just like I'm on jets
Oh yes, time's hard, you all stressed, your mind's gone
Going through a large test, hard-pressed to find God, define God
Look in the mirror, you might find God
Even though we full of sin we full of him, defy odds
My scars match his as long as I've been beat down
I should have nails through my hands and my feet now
He was on the cross said speak, now I'm hearin' you
Saved by the blood, he might leak down a miracle
Gotta be the-

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad & Kent Jamz]
Black blood make the grass grow in the ghetto
Black blood keep the sunshine on your face, I know
Black blood make the grass grow in the ghetto
Black love, black love
Black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto (I know)
Black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto (I know)
Black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto
Black blood (black blood), I know (I know)

[Outro]
In the ghetto (Ghetto)
Black blood, make the grass grow
Ohhh, ohhh (Ohhh)
Ohhh, black blood (In the ghetto)
(Ghetto) Black blood, ohhh
