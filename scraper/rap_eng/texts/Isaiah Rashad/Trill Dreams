[Intro: YGTUT]
And she thick, got a bad bitch, get her mouth to lube it
And she thick, I ain't got shit, but this fucking music
Let me dream, fuck it let me lean
Where that dirty sprite?
Let me scheme, out here chasing cream
Out here every night

[Bridge: YGTUT]
Trill, dreams (nigga, uh)
(Rest in peace Pimp C)
I tell her, I tell her

[Verse 1: YGTUT]
Take it off bitch bend over, let me see it
If you need a trill figure in your life, let me be it
I'm so focused on the come up
Hoe done feel like I just woke up
Smoking on that presidential, the oval office where I roll up
I ain't fucking with no lames, too many of them flip flop
Married to the game, you can call that love and hip hop
You can see it in my eyes I bet I want it
In front of closed doors fuck it we gon' break 'em open
The fuck you mean?

[Bridge: YGTUT]
Trill, dreams (nigga, nigga, uh)
I be like, I be like

[Verse 2: YGTUT]
Lord I pray to God my later days will be sunny
'Cause all I'm seeing is rain and bitches waiting for money
To follow one of these clouds, bitches is money hungry
But I just want some brain you ain't gotta tell me you love me
Baby you won't get attached to a nigga if I get lucky
It'll go from much as fucking her or just being like fuck me
Trust me I know, I'm such an ass I let my pants sag to let it show
Fuck your feelings and opinions now just leave me alone
I tell me momma "Don't you worry I'm gon' make it better"
I pray God shelter us through bad weather as I get my efforts
Her left leg and right leg I try to keep 'em seperate
I swear I had that pussy running like a fucking leopard
Shit I'm a German Shepard, and my bitch look kinda nice
Call me clean as fuck, and my earrings look like Sonic ice
Vagina be kinda tight, codeine free, some kind of Sprite
I'm good with god, we gon' get so high we just might fly tonight

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad]
Sometimes I get paid, sometimes I get dope
Sometimes I get laid, sometimes I get throwed
Sometimes I get blazed, sometimes I get low
They gon' know my name, no matter how it go
And I say, I say, money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
I say money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser

[Verse 3: Isaiah Rashad]
I'm riding out with my only, might spend dollar sign with my bitch
Sometimes niggas start to get lonely, sometimes niggas start to get rich
I'ma get paid
Nigga got killed over twenty-two dollars
Could'a bought a blunt, come and get blazed
I'ma wrap this, she gon' roll that
I'ma get lit, I'ma get made
Stay talking that bullshit and I [?] that tool shit
And I'm 'bout it ain't know raw shit I said it bitch
And this full clip, and it's crowded
It's the mind of a nigga on the edge of the bed
With a tool of the side and a head full of liq'
Come pray with a nigga, stay with a nigga
Smoke J with a nigga, he alive or he's dead now
Might spend dollar sign with my bitch
Sometimes niggas start to get lonely, sometimes niggas start to get rich
I'mma get paid
Nigga got killed over twenty-two dollars
Could'a bought a blunt, come and get blazed
I'ma wrap this, she gon' roll that
I'ma get lit, I'ma get made

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad]
Sometimes I get paid, sometimes I get dope
Sometimes I get laid, sometimes I get throwed
Sometimes I get blazed, sometimes I get low
They gon' know my name, no matter how it go
And I say, I say, money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
I say money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most not l-l-l-l

[Outro: Isaiah Rashad]
Money on the dresser
Drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the -ost not the -esser
I say money on the
Drive a co-
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
I say money on the
Top notch hoes get the, top notch
Kevin did that shit, uh
