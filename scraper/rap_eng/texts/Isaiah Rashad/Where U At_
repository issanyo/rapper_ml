[Intro: Dave Free]
Hey bro
You know what March, April, May, June, July, and about to be August, have in common, bro?
The fact that I still don't have your goddamn album
Why is it? I don't understand this process, dog, like how you got...
Yo, everybody was bumpin' your last shit
You don't want to get your next shit out? You don't care?
You don't care that they want to hear your next shit?
You just that good, huh?
That must be your whole thing then
Man you got until Friday, bro
I'm not asking no more, dog
You got until Friday; I'm not asking no more
