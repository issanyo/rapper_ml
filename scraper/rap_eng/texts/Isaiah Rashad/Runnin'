[Verse]
Uhh, ridin' along in that all black Regal
Black tint, represent for my all black people, no kid
And no rims in sight, I just keep it for the mental, but also my pencil
I know it's hard to put your heart in what you into
When she got a kill body and aisle and she a rider
With the world on my shoulders, lookin' at the future house, daughter, and when I'm older
I think about my father and I'm prayin' that he sober
But the walls of the younger won't let him get over
But I forgive him for the game that he told her
But I just wish that mothafucka would just grow up
He fit to something, can't afford a box of doughnuts
And my flow is kickin' something I just spaz and I throw up
My nigga wear a mask and you know what?
That nigga he'll blast 'til you know what
Back to the future or the past I ask
And I'm tryin' to stay happy but that path don't last
Sometimes I look back and just laugh
Aunt had two strokes and she still kept hope
And so I keep hope and keep focus
Hands on the bar cause life's a roller coaster
Even in death life is never over
Legacy shreds are floatin' 'round in the seven seas
But I'm lookin' for something that's more heavenly
And when I die I'm takin' music, you in debt for me
I'll just smoke 'em
And I'll roll 'em
