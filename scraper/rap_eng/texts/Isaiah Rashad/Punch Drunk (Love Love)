[Intro]
I'm so fuckin' lost, lost, lost, lost
I'm so fuckin' lost, lost, lost, lost
Got me so confused, in love, in love, love, love
I'm just, just

[Bridge]
I'm just travelin' on this plane
I'm not sure if I'm sane, plus
Love can't, love can't entertain
I don't know what to do

[Verse 1]
Welcome to my obsession
My love testin', my drug session
Tell me if, if I put tats on my eyes
Would you recognize the signs of all the dyin'?
Is it inkblots or am I really cryin' over lies of lives, can we multiply
All the happiness and talkin' saddest shit because I'm out of it
Little dealer ran out the powder bitch
They don't know me, PC, and Rick rowdy bitch
I'm only talkin' shit 'til them niggas stop doubtin' me
I'm talkin' some of you shots sittin' [??] bitch
If you ain't on it then you niggas ain't on shit
Done with the cursin' for a second
Creepin' like a reverend but I'm hopin' I can creep my way to Heaven
I say I'm done with the cursin' for a second
I'm hopin' that I creep my way to Heaven
They so confused

[Hook]
Love, love, love, love
I'm so fuckin' lost, lost, lost, lost
Has got me so confused, in love, in love, love, love
I'm so fuckin' lost
I don't know what to do

[Bridge]

But the best part is
Shit I don't know what to do

[Verse 2]
Back to the militant man
He walkin' around with the girl heart in his hand
His heart on his sleeve, like a patch would be
With a heart in his hand he decides to squeeze
Now she can't even breathe, and she all in his clutches
Therefore she can't leave, soul seepin' through his knuckles
Damn, I saw the boy chuckle
Why he fall in love with the hustle

[Hook + Bridge]

[Outro]
But the best part is
Shit I don't know what to do
