Came out busting
Came out bluffing
Came out fucking
On your cousin
I do all these floozes voices
And they ran it with yo number
You in trouble, out here sunny
I go barbecue with Satan
Bitch you busy, it ain't shit
I went shopping, left it running
Check my hundreds, check my onion
We watch cable at my Auntie's
When my papa wasn't trapping
But my coco [?]
Mr. Magic Billy Batson
Mr. Magic Billy Batson
Miss me with that loco kitten
On a nigga, get it cracking

I'm not surprised, I'm on a ride
Been on a ride, where is my eyes
Spamming a lie, just hold it down
All I require, just hold it down
They go shit talking when we not around
Niggas be hating with feet on the ground
Act like the chick with a beat on her couch
Nut on her coochie and then beat on her mouth

Came out bussin (16x)

I roll red, I'm so cunning
High tech digit, flat four button
Bad boy shawty, that boy probably
Nascar Audi, Swanton Bomb it
Two white bitches, still gon' pick it
Fly shit kick it, still cold digit
Young like Slizzy, get back witcha
Step back, hit em with the step back swish it
[?], hoping that her nut might glisten
Shit might triple, shit might whistle
She might hit you, Willy Wonka,in my codeine
Then my [?], then my nigga
I been stacking for a really
You went platinum up in prison
Im just floating on a river
Please be with it, please be for it
Never control it, I can't control it
