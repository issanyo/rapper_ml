[Intro]
I just want your bitch, I don't
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I just want your bitch I don't want no fuckin' problem
Look at what I got, he might motherfuckin' bargain, yeah
Nigga try finesse me with the hard one
How the hell you rob the fuckin' robber?
Project Pat was always like a father figure
Skinny Pimp respect me bitch I'm mobbin' nigga
Only reason anything was tinted when it's rented
Probably cause my dirty niggas with me
Ain't really down with that trainin' a bitch
Hangin' just to smoke, boy you lame as a bitch
Audi in the back and a Porsche in the front
I got some titties on my face, got 'em crawl in the mud
Since a youngin' I've been addicted to them hoes
But I never been the type to give 'em gold
After fuckin' she be lucky if I'm holdin' a bitch
Ol' favor, askin' niggas always owin' a bitch

[Hook]
I wanna Cadillac, I want a Benz too
I wanna SS for my friends too
I wanna big ass house, I want a small one
So I can rent that out and I can call ya
I wanna Cadillac, I want a Benz too
I wanna SS for my friends too
I wanna big ass house, I want a small one
So I can rent that out and I can call ya

[Verse 2]
Like I'm ballin' for my inside
Freaky bitch wanna fist but my wrist tired
Vendetta, spent the bread on a rice cooker
Roll mine, held his with a vice gripper
I'm at home when I'm gone, make your life different
Do some shit on your own, they don't fuck with your ledge
I'm gon' fuck with my gut, I just laced it with lead
It's my mom on my phone, bitch quit givin' me head
I'm in love with the feel
Give me head, let me chill
They for show, I'm for real
They for show, I'm for real

[Hook]
I wanna Cadillac, I want a Benz too
I wanna SS for my friends too
I wanna big ass house, I want a small one
So I can rent that out and I can call ya
I wanna Cadillac, I want a Benz too
I wanna SS for my friends too
I wanna big ass house, I want a small one
So I can rent that out and I can call ya
