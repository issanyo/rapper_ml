[Hook: TUT]
Damn we gotta hurry, late to the Sunday service
Last night I hit the town, late I was on that screw-juice swervin'
I swear I'm tired of doing shit on purpose, but doing it without a purpose
A lotta niggas doing shit on purpose, but doing it without a purpose

[Verse 1: TUT]
Shout out to God, Jesus is my homie, we kick it all the time
Still got love for the ho in the bed heard there was something up her nose
Geeking off a couple lines and we still got time
Yeah, we gon get it right, yeah we can get it right, we gon get it alright
Yeah, we gon get it right, yeah we can get it right, we gon get it alright
Aight! aight! my nigga Joseph back home aight! aight!
Lets try to stay out this time cause we both too grown aight! aight!
I know I'm dead wrong and I'm trying to make it right
I'm gonna bring it to the light aight?
Those niggas ain't yo niggas, better keep an eye on them I'm just saying aight?
Hey, tell me have you ever seen a snake and a rat work together?
I hit 'em blind in the back, I'ma goin' ahead and put a mousetrap out in the grass
Stop moving too fast to conclusions I can't eat at your church for communion
Sat down and when I stood up a dub sack fell out my pocket on your church pew
But we'll get it alright

[Bridge: TUT & Isaiah Rashad]
Yeah, we alright
Yeah, we can get it right
Yeah, we gonna get it right, yeah we can get it right, we gonna get it alright
Yeah, we gonna get it right, yeah we can get it right, we gonna get it alright
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back

[Verse 2: TUT]
All he ever wanted was some gold on his wrist
All he ever wanted was some pot he could piss
All he ever wanted was to pull up to the shows in a Rolls
And make the hoes go "Who is this?"
Damn, niggas talking shit but we been great
'Bout to win this shit like a sweepstakes
Niggas talking beef I'm at the table trying to eat steak
Eatin' good nigga bout to have a clean plate
I remember how me and Shoey use to run it up
Let's go and cop some kicks nigga
I swear niggas stay up in the air
I've got the family back home
I got to keep it to the sticks nigga
You know I had a show the other night
It was fly but I wasn't, I was sober as a gopher
The feds that was there I couldn't sleep that night
I was laying in the bed, and I was scared of under covers
Damn, niggas getting wetter like a pissed on mattress
I am living life in the fast lane
Getting money making money fast mane
First in the cash and the cops came
Niggas trying to put me in a box
I'ma rock his ass like a socker bopper
I swear to God if I make one penny off this rap shit, I'mma be prouder than Oscar
Nigga, I'm TUT!
