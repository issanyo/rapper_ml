[Hook: Ducko Mcfli]
I gotta get it, get it, get it
I gotta get it, man, once I get to this money I'mma
Get it, flip it, break it down
Get it, flip it, break it down
Get it, flip it, break it down
Send it out to my people, it's like

[Verse 1: Ducko Mcfli]
They like hold up, roll up
It goes down cause we pour up
OZs of that OG
Double cups of that codeine
I'm faded, I'm gone, I'm twisted, I'm leanin'
I don't know where I am, I don't care when I'm leavin'
I just crush a bit, little bit
Roll it up, take a hit
Get the Q like you ScHoolboy
I'm A$AP with them jewels boy
I'm Rocky, come watch me, you see me doin' my thing
I'm draped out and I'm drippin', that's why your bitch all on my thing
And if I want her when I see it I go get her, I don't hesitate
Fly young nigga, you would swear that I could levitate
Ciroc by the bot', dutches by the box
Drinks by the liter, I'm just livin' 'til I stop

[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad]
Now I be rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
Chillin' with these bitches
I been pimpin' and mackin' like my nigga Goldie
Nigga keep your pimp hand strong
Tell them hoes I said that, tell 'em bring my bread back
Tell them hoes I'm stressed out, I'm a mess now
Tell 'em bring that ses back
Bitch roll that weed up, don't use no grinder, I never mind her
Use your fingers, eight ball so timeless, I MJG her
Keep it space age, eatin' space cakes
A Kelis bitch, and a milkshake
Up and turn a key, go and turn a key
Bumpin' Marvin Gaye and them Screw tapes
Look

[Verse 3: P.A. Lit]
Lit
They tryin' to get it in, what it go for?
Four hundred for the purple, no squares in my circle
Shirt match my team, Life Gang my scar
See them bars all in my dreams, I need dead people to sleep
Tryin' to cash out this week, I could run this all in my old sneaks
Flavor droppin', young player partner, I'm a young nigga they dig me
Country boy no pig feet, see it all, your lens cheap
My minds on they Benji', put that with me, we too G
