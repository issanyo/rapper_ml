[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
Look into my wallet
Found some change for your life
And maybe a new car or some brain from your wife
You probably never thought of how the sames are alike
And probably never tried to pull the dark from the light
I'm higher than a kite, while I'm riding on a bike
Through Amsterdam fields, with a head full of pills
And half of my face is numb
Pour some Neapolitan on the racist's tongue
This Chevy's a sixty-seven but the race is young
But she gives good brain but her ass is dumb
I have no one to blame, Obama nor Bush
I just need a little hug from a bag full of kush
I just need a little hug from a bag full of kush
That's it

[Verse 2]
Lemme take you back, thinkin' real hard
Way before I started doin' this rap
Just a young boy with a nice dream
Tryin' to get a puff of wheels on this real life thing
Tryin' to make her feel, tryin' to make a mil'
In this rap game but I ain't thinkin' it was real
They ain't takin' me serious but I'm 'bout to let you know
I ain't nothing with these jokes
Nice and smooth like a blunt of kush
But I can go real hard like some [?] kush
Amsterdam lookin' in your system
Got a nigga feelin' like he on swisha
