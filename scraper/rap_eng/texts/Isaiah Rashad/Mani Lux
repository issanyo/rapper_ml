[Verse 1]
Aww, them titties that I sleep on, beneath the thump?
The beating broken heart, but it keep going
Disgusted with that fake ass smile, that you keep on
And you ain't got the nuts to say you hate me so I creep on
Down to your panties, down-down 'til you scream out
"Now baby, just fuck me" Our relationship is more like hate a bitch
It's ugly, and these cuts getting deeper, it's fatal shit, it's bloody
It drove me to popping pills and drinking water too muddy
I'm saying "Can I use my hands baby? It's mine"
To them niggas that you sometimes share with, it's fine
That you think these eyes that I keep on staring with, it's blind
Yeah, I told you that I did not care bitch, I'm lying

[Hook]
You made me fall in love for a minute
You made me fall in love for a minute
You made me fall in love for a minute
You made me fall in love for a minute

[Bridge]
Love ain't always so demanding, sometimes it's just you
And we live life on different planets, but that ain't no excuse
And what we got is so withstanding, but sometimes we get bruised
And when the world don't understand me, I always got you

[Hook]
