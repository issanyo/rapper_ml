[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad]
My 40, I'm sippin, I'm sippin, I'm sippin
My 40, I'm sippin, I'm sippin, I'm sippin
My 40, I'm sippin, I'm sippin, I'm sippin
My 40, I'm sippin, I'm sippin, I'm sippin
My 40, I'm sippin, I'm sippin, I'm sippin
My 40, I'm sippin, I'm sippin, I'm sippin

[Verse 1: Michael da Vinci]
My 40, my homie, my cousin
He been there since knee high, I been sippin' since a youngin'
My money been the lowest, he been chillin' like my woman
Cold as hell, brainless dropped him once, got a concussion
He fizzin' when I open like she comin'
Got my mental on my homies
Fuckin' rappers all bologna
I'm so steak and macaroni
Keep me Michael, I like hoagies
Drape me out in flyer garments
But dog don't forget my 40
He been there when I was lonely

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad]
My 40, I'm sippin, I'm sippin, I'm sippin
My 40, I'm sippin, I'm sippin, I'm sippin
My 40, I'm sippin, I'm sippin, I'm sippin
My 40, I'm sippin, I'm sippin, I'm sippin
My 40, I'm sippin, I'm sippin, I'm sippin
My 40, I'm sippin, I'm sippin, I'm sippin

[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad]
My 40, my homie, I'm ridin'
He been here by my side when I was thinkin' suicidal
Feel me, feel me, do you, do you, oh no don't Do or Die it
She say I only love her when I'm drunk and when I'm high and
Dog I hate that sober I be throwed
Tell my mama I be straight
Tell my boo 'bout my cuckoo
Now she worried 'bout me late
Give a fuck about my health
Give me dollars I'm okay
Can't go back to being broke
Give me stanky on my plate
Cause I was rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
Chillin' with them bitches
I was pimpin' and mackin' like my nigga Goldie
Tank, it on empty
Just might hit Brittany up in that kidney
Macaroni drippin', almost had kiddies
Back up in jail, dirty as hell
Bitches be fightin', spreadin' my business
