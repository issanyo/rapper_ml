[Verse 1]
Drugs now, I-I was passed out
This is a movie and I always play the asshole
I got a bad role, but it will get me paid
Groupies are in the stands, and it ain't get me laid
I got a simple [?], that fuck the simple man
Ain't always got to be the deepest just to entertain
My life is in a slump, you in the ditches man
See this is winter whore, summer don't love no more

[Verse 2]
Summer don't know me no more
Eager man, that's all
Summer don't know me no more
He just let me love in my sea
Cause I do know, Lord
From you that
Just died, yeah

[Hook]
I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

[Verse 3]
Don't stop the buck when it comes
It's the dawn, you'll see
Money won't get there
Ten years passed tonight
You'll flee
If you do that
I'll be some
To find you

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Now I'm up early in the mornin'
Breath stinkin' as I'm yawnin'
Last bar that was borrowed from 2Pac
Man he asked Santa for some peace
So he ain't gotta use his piece
Got his money saved up in the shoebox
He wants some sheets or some covers or at least get a bed
Good woman by his side or at least get some head
That old shit in your mind, ahh, sucky, sucky
Got his money saved up and he spent it all on pussy

[Outro]
Man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man
Man, man, MB on the track nigga
MB on the track nigga
MB on the track nigga
Don't nobody else expect y'all [?] nigga
And we out
Maybe in time, maybe in time

Wow
I'm the shit plus ten, ha
