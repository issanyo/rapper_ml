One thing about Raw, Raw got swag
Raw hit the mall, then Raw pop tags
Raw stay clean, Raw stay french
You know it must be '87, denim jeans (are guess)
I bought 'em in Miami, ship them broads upto Duvall
Must of had 20 chickenheads up in that Uhaul
I move so smooth cause them jackboys backtrack
Half a quarter mill in the brown Louie napsack
