And I'm riding good and I'm
Looking real fly (x3)

(Blood Raw:)
Outside forest green, inside peanut butter
Higher then a mu'fucka, call that bitch peter pan
Bitch I'm da man, I'm da man
Riding bluedown, all my niggas spent 100 grand
Shit from florida hoe, I brought the band with me
You see this what I do, I call it fam music
Look how I'm sittin, yea I'm riding green now
Hopper grass grill on it and I'm looking mean now
See 14 depped up, everybody blowing purp
Ancient momma paint job, yea it came with the surs?
Hanging out the roof looking down on them crowds
Somebody must have farted, everybody got frowns

(Chorus:)
I said 26 Inches got me
Sitting so high (x3)
Yea I'm blowin good and I'm
Feeling so high (x3)
And I'm riding good and I'm
Looking real fly (x3)
You can hear me before you see me
When I ride by (x3)

(Young Buck:)
26 inches on my chevy, hope my tires fit
Old school, old money, 50 ain't buy this
I just bought a dome, sell me two capris
The blue suede interior, the matching baby seats
Pop my hood on these bitches, let me show em what my money like
Heavy in the game, so I sprayed it cocaine white
Boose got me loose, 180 7 boose
See we don't blow them brains out, we just chop the roof (YEAAA!)
She said my chevy cute, it match her gucci boots
So now she break me off, everytime I come through
I can drop the back, pickup the front
Make it lean to the left, and get right back to the money bitch
I'm clean by myself, but I'm hell with the crew
Cause if I'm on 26s then my niggas is too
Yea I seen ya looking at me, so shawty what it do
Me and blood raw rolling, tell jeezy where we going

(Chorus:)
I said 26 Inches got me
Sitting so high (x3)
Yea I'm blowin good and I'm
Feeling so high (x3)
And I'm riding good and I'm
Looking real fly (x3)
You can hear me before you see me
When I ride by (x3)

(Blood Raw:)
Shoulders, Chest, pants, shoes (Haha, talk to em)
Somebody better wipe me down
I'm feelin good, looking good, you know I'm clean
(girl voice) you do ya thang
They say I show my ass, but I don't mean need too
Lil momma wanna holla, I scooped the whole crew
I'm in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
You can hear me 'fore you see me, I'm in it with them thangs

(Chorus:)
I said 26 Inches got me
Sitting so high (x3)
Yea I'm blowin good and I'm
Feeling so high (x3)
And I'm riding good and I'm
Looking real fly x3
You can hear me before you see me
When I ride by x3

(Young Buck:) Yeaaaaaaa
