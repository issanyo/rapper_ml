[Verse 1]
I don't beg nobody pardon to be confident
I'm just saying my shit didn't exist until I did it
I'm the one that suffered for the politics that I done spit
I ain't quit, I hit every continent and bodied it
School of Hard Knocks equipped, and I ain't get a scholarship
Bet I had it poppin' since hip-hop was on that power fist
Then y'all got counterfeit, I switched and did the opposite
Now I'm on some outsider shit, ain't that about a bitch?
I ain't never lied about what my skin is, it's obvious
I'm just so obsessed with seeing power for the powerless
I insist
I would never operate on cowardice
Rather chop my wrist than be afraid to take this kind of risk
Every single line I ever spit I put it on my kids
On my green, on my tears
All them shows, all them years
All them flows, all them years
I was chose for this here
Maybe I'm a dreamer, that's exactly what my problem is
When I do dream, believe I see it all too clear
I don't need your money, I just wanted y'all to hear

[Verse 2]
Y'all know me, Brother Ali
Kill em now do it softly
Heroes, ???
Eyedea and Ability and ???
That's the army
Y'all make a song bout getting hated on, but it ain't about me
Just cause you ain't ahead of your game
Don't be yelling my name on the shit that don't involve me
Don't call me, none of y'all cats want me
You can find me in the lobby
Put my arm around your baby mom
Kissing on her neck like, "man, this is all me"
So salty, my metaphors two steps ahead of yours
And I'm a step ahead of you
And he get the heads to boo, then I beckon you
That what you better do is let em through
Begging you to write a line to try to find
A better mind mutterin' bone-shutterin'
Utterance is, other than this, it doesn't exist
I'm competitive and never lose
It's hell to anyone who wanna diss Ali
Ain't nobody fucking with my disc jockey
It's all about whether or not you rhyme nice
Don't care about the ice in your wrist watch
Freeze!

[Verse 3]
People ain't eatin', they say the reason
Resources depleted for the defense
I'm offended by these authentic lies
Should have been retired, let me identify 'em
You never give me quire, my people been inspired
I'm the little fire flickerin' within the rye
Feel it vibrate, shake and wake a sleeping giant
Keep him vibrant and vital, re-energize him
My time's arrivin', my shine is blindin'
???, demonizin'
Guys on the wrong side of right from the stripe
Pray lightning strike twice, ice on their idols
Isis, Osiris, Christ in his lightness
Day of resurrection bring life to the lifeless
Tear the wall down, pull the crown off the tyrant
Rebuild, gentrify the planet for the righteous
He who sacrificed it, for the greater good
Elevate him where they should to the title of "Your Highness"
Only tried surviving is the pious (pious)
United by the mighty human life ties to bind us
Undefined kindness, mine's from confinement
The sightless got about a blind of the blindest
We read the signs inscribed in the horizon
Bright yellow chopped through the night time, ???

[Verse 4]
He brought a funny ass beat instead
I just switch up and go off the head
I never wrote nothing to nothing like this
Just cause I look like these white kids
Don't mean that that's the shit I'm on
Brother Ali, let me just get a minu-minute more
In the morning, stumble over the words
Fumble over the words
It's off the head that's what you heard
Big bad Brother Ali
And ain't nobody out here fucking with me
My man Fashawn bouta get his ass on
And you know it's all going down after that jawn
My brother Murs is here, my curse is here
I brought my old verses here
I ain't got a verse for this here
But I got something out of my heart that I can spit and it's clear
I effervesce, so never-the-less
Brother Ali always come and try to impress
Just get respect from the big cats
Like Sway and them, shit's fact

[Verse 5]
I was raised with the raised fist
Angela Davis, summer '68 Olympics
Train banging your wings against the chain
In the events you became gauge-less
Aim to my existence is to resist
Back never bent below, never relent
Of all lights shown, I'm a glimmerin' glint
Was named after a king, and I'll miss the greatest
Changed the world in the ring with his fists
More so with the gift when it rained from his lips
Bigger than just an individual gift
He had a vision for bringing dignity to the crib
Gold medalist in his Olympic event
Significant respect glistenin' off his neck
US flag waved the globe solid
Wore it everywhere he went just to show what it meant
Leapt off the plane back on the pavement
People hell bent, they would never relent
Celebrate him, but it's hand still clinched
And the problems one piece of metal couldn't fix
Legend is he pitched it in the Ohio river
What good's the requisition if I know I'm a victim
Hell bent I'm sending hell back the curriculum
Last president slash second class citizen
Diligent to fight for the people
19 years old sacrifice his ego
Here we go
Was that all five?
