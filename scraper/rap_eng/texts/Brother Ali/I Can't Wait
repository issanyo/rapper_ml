[Hook]:
B-b-b-b-baby, I-I-I-I can't wait, your love
B-b-b-b-baby, I-I-I-I can't wait

[Verse One]:
Wait, wait, I done tumbled into love again
Ladies first, safety last, nothing under him
Watch it crumble then, build it up again
Long kiss, good fright, you let it tuck you in
Nothing other than, human suffering
Let your frozen bones shutter in the summer wind
Crash test dummy friend turned up to ten
Loves riding shotgun, never buckled in
Make your blood rush so percussively
That you don't adjust to see the drum's new custody
Running full tilt faceless
Eyes wide you collide through that plate glass
Straight smash, open wide, gaping gash
Make this the last time that you late for class
Step in, effect like Armageddon
I thought by now you'd learned your lesson

[Hook]:
B-b-b-b-baby, I-I-I-I can't wait, your love
B-b-b-b-baby, I-I-I-I can't wait, your love
Baby
Your love
Baby

[Verse Two]:
See there kid, heads up
Collect your busted body parts, get a leg up
Chasing your own tail if I don't fetch ya
Your tail gotta a nice art but the end sucks
Try again
You keep diving in the small child end
And any chance to survive is thin
I pretend the boy won't cry again
Are they trying to snap or play the world's smallest violin?
Tragedy and love mine
Play it again Sam, rocking your hindsight blinders
And I insist on meeting love like the visitors
Fuck the other ones, skip the drum and then just be gone

[Hook]:
B-b-b-b-baby, I-I-I-I can't wait, your love
B-b-b-b-baby, I-I-I-I can't wait, your love
Baby
Your love
Baby
