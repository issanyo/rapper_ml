There's more than one way to tell a lie homie
You can fabricate events that never happened
Or just leave out important parts of the story
There’s a much better chance no one'll catch it
These are lies of omission
A lot of your missions are vanilla rendition of some real shit you witnessed
Tracks you record are only half the story
You're stacking points for the path you forged
You stood watching unknown cats explore this indie rap before they turn the cameras on
Then branded your flag and branded it yours as if as though there wasn’t a map before
But you've been listening that's for sure
A lot of [?] and similarities they can't ignore
When the interviewer ask for your influences that inform that craft of yours
The actual mold for the mask you wore now you gotta act like you are not a fan no more
You're an imitator at your core
The monkey on your favorite rappers back it matches yours
I wonder when you stand on your big ass stage all of your teenage fans applaud
If somewhere in the back of your brain you're asking yourself just who are they clapping for?
Probably felt like little man at the court
And big cats won't pass you the basketball
Now you grab the door and get a chance to score and put up stats galore and figure damn I'm all
You’re somebody we should be happy for
What’s a monkey to a beetle after all?
I try not to be mad of course
But certain things I just can't endorse
