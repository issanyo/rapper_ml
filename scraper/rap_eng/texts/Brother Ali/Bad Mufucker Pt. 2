[Intro: MURS]
That was, that was the end
And it squashed the whole beef

[Verse 1: Brother Ali]
I'm so incredibly nasty
Yes my Mama slapped me when she had me
Told me get your ass out with your Daddy
Talked hella trash and my teachers couldn't stand me
Used to call me bastard and told me I was trashy
Unsupervised child, they call me a Latchkey
At-risk youth from a single parent family
Nuts got hairy and my voice got raspy
Crews were getting acne, I was getting savvy
Yes I'm a bad motherfucker, understand me
Grew up beaten, broken glass, rapping in the alley
Got my hands dirty, I was hiding in a trash heap
Hopping out, knocking out cats, grabbing they ten speed
Little boys and the girls, they both pack heat
Both had something I need from em in they pants see
Broads got the booty all felt up in the back seat
Dudes got they lunch money boosted and they ass beat
Can I get it back, fuck naw, don't even ask me
When you see the Preacher
Keep your peace and don't you dare speak
None of y'all snitches ain't in the same class as me
We ain't the same cause you wrote a couple raps G
That cover charge that you payin is my salary
Merchandise you carry away is all tax free
Facing all my bills and I count my money carefully
Bet your fucking ass ain't nobody ever jack me, see

[Hook x2: Brother Ali]
You's a bad motherfucker man
On the other hand, you never see a sucker stand close to where the Brother stand
You God damn right about that
Got me so pissed off, I wanna fight em out back

[Verse 2: Brother Ali]
My nuts done swung all around the planet
Where the fuck y'all from
I already captured it, I bust my gun
Had a little cannon kid
Caught a little accident, slid em in the ambulance
He asked for this rumble, his ass got trouble
I'm picking glass out of my knuckles like that's comfortable
Where you running to, you ever wanna a true
Bad motherfucker, you accept no substitute
No understudy dudes and no number
Two
Trust when it come to busting loose, I'm the ugly truth
You ever want the proof, you can check the documents
Or you just watch the kid break door with my fist
I'm on some shit
Your old lady grabbing on the kid like she chose me
Police captain, ain't attempting to hold me
A O.G. mack with a .38 told me

[Hook]
