[VERSE]
I do not have any memory of peaceful sleep
Feels like I read about it in a novel once
I believe that all the little secrets people keep
When you drop your guard, and slumber, they come out and front
I crush to sleep for nothing, I'm left to beat the sun
And my breath, they keep it rushing, my chest, with deep percussion
If death and sleep are cousins, then justice is disgusting
We'll probably be cellmates behind Hell's gates
The devil lives inside my eyelids
When I close them I hit rising violence, I'm supposed to find some silence
Rockin' the back seat of insomniac theatre
With the answers in the subtitles, I just can't read em
I'm right where the fears at, fighting the tears back
Trying to catch my balance on life before the piers crack
I hear that, hate slammin my own little prison
I declare that, ?hate band?, my soul didn't listen
So I stare at, the crack in the ceiling until the earth go twistin
Glare at, that little feeling that I've been burdened with, its turbulant
Only you and I know that the hurt exists
Everyone else just see the surfaces

[Hook]
Somebody tell my mother that I died
Somebody tell my mother that I died
Somebody tell my mother that I died
Somebody tell my mother that I

[BRIDGE]
I can only hope that, when I wake up at night in cold sweats
That you're suffering and miserable in your own bed
I pray I haunt you the way you haunt me
The way I feel I never want to see you walk free
I hope your thoughts will burn as you toss and squirm
And curse your life, feeling like you lost your turn
And I pray that I haunt you the way you haunt me
The way I feel I never want to see you walk free
I can only hope that, when I wake up at night in cold sweats
That you're suffering and miserable in your own bed
I pray I haunt you the way you haunt me
The way I feel I never want to see you walk free
I hope your thoughts will burn as you toss and squirm
And curse your life, feeling like you lost your turn
And I pray that I haunt you the way you haunt me
The way I feel I never want to see you walk free
Fuck you Ali!

[Hook]
Somebody tell my mother that I died
Somebody tell my mother that I died
Somebody tell my mother that I died
Somebody tell my mother that I
