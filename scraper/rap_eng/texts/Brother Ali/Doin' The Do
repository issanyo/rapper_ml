[Verse 1]
That night we threw down hard like our lives depended on it
Smoke in the eyes, suspended by the moment
I pull my hat low so as not to see nothing but my spit clutching the mic, reflected in the light
Felt like we breathed in electric air from the evening
Exhaled a jewel and left it there
I'm in my own hometown where the drums live
Guitar picker from Phila on some other shit
I smelt Paris in the horn, taste London in the keys
When I'm a Rhymesayer, brothers with me
On a deep cosmos, natural high cool
With God in my ear tellin' me to ride through
I'm ain't trying to hear the playback, jack
I was there in the flesh and I'm blessed that I can say that
You feel it in your chest and play that
You got it in your mind, say that
You can't arrange that

[Hook]
One, two
Rockin' for you and you
Ursus Minor Crew officially doin' the do
We gon' throw down hard, like oh my God
And when it hit ya there ain't nothin' that you can do
So one, two
Rockin' for you and you
Ursus Minor Crew officially doin' the do
We gon' throw down hard, like oh my God
And when it hit ya there ain't nothin' that you can do

[Verse 2]
I said temper thy tongue my son
Ah, a good kid at drums is hard to come by
I found rhythm where the doves cry
So attentive I was, my young mind a dry sponge
Soaked it all in
Grow some balls then
Not try to quote what I wrote with a ball pen
Since the choice to rap or just voice the facts
I guess my point is that
I been
Standing on four four beats butt naked
Since around the time Busy Bee was famous, huh
Music 'po be somethin' sacred
So please rest assured that Ali don't fake shit
Regardless of the theme
And as hard as it may seem
Put my two cents on the table
Whether they tarnished or they clean
Keep my heart in the stream
Separate myself from the garbage on the scene
Come down now you

[Hook]
Rockin' for you and you
Ursus Minor Crew officially doin' the do
We gon' throw down hard, like oh my God
And when it hit ya there ain't nothin' that you can do
One, two
Rockin' for you and you
Ursus Minor Crew officially doin' the do
We gon' throw down hard, like oh my God
And when it hit ya there ain't nothin' that you can do hit me

[Outro]
We wanna thank Ursus Minor
Ladies and gentleman, Ursus Minor
