[Intro]
Shit, you know a new hot beat come out and everybody gotta jump on the bandwagon on that trendy shit and rock on it
Ya ain't got this beat, though!
Shout out Jake One!
Uh!

[Verse]
Y'all see trends and pretend
I'm a veteran which means I'm pre-trend
Hand grown beats, sweetened, weakened, and watered down
I lead men, never follow clowns
Most time my soul speaks, then I jot it down
Therefore, most weekends I'm out of town
First class seat, feet seldom on the ground
'Less I'm in the V, she got her pedal to the ground
I do not friend and de-friend, I'm all around
Keep them 'till the end, go every round
Now, got a couple dead homies but no ex-homies
Once I give my word by that I'm bound
Racks on racks is in my hands, my cash is in advance
I don't just put it all in my raps, it's in my pants or
Tucked under the mattress or in the bank
I ain't telling y'all exactly, I'm more savvy than you think
I walked around with gats and carried a little shank
Cause the world treat me bad and I couldn't afford a shrink
Shit was rough, I scribbled it in my books
They say you must be independent cause your image sucks
They say necessity's a bitch
Or the mother of all inventions, you take your pick
Either way I ain't afraid to take a risk
So that's the one I made my babies with
They saying light skin is in style, dark skin is in style
How come white folks always in style though? Huh
You can check the file but you know what's never in style?
Fat Muslim rapping albinos, uh, yeah I know
I only love her if she in the struggle
I can't relate to a woman who's never been through nothing
High, saddity, privileged and soft
They pretty but they always say something to piss me off
My heart's forever with the underdog
Who got nothing to give except for love accord
You should listen to this when you're occupying
? frontlining
Even if you don't join us in the Ramadan
Starving the one thing we all got in common
That's why I'm not styling on 'em
Righteous dude in a Maybach I'm Stalley on 'em
More like a four-door Honda on 'em
Put my baby mama through college on 'em
Off a type of rhyming they find inspiring
I'm not a boss on a yacht, I'm Basquiat
Before I finish the rhyme, you start rewinding
Cause everything that drops out my mind's a diamond
I'm only rocking the bling that's in my chin
Diamonds and gin, to shining from within
That's some shit the poor people say
Maybe so but it's true for me either way
You can ask your man Hov if I'm blinging
He gotta admit it (Uh, it's just different)
The best verse on a song I ain't even on
It's either now, 4th king, never steer you wrong
Reporting live, A-L-I, your brother
Mourning in America, dreaming in color
