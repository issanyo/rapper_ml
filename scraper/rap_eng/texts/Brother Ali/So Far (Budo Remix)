[Hook: Shaprece]
We've come so far, and now they asking who we are
Cause we reach for the stars
And it's been so long
I ain't planning on going on
And now they see, exactly what it takes to be
Something different
And wouldn't you agree
We here and we ain't going nowhere

[Verse One: Grynch]
Here's the junior album, the 3rd time's a charm
And they ain't sleeping on me, no, they heard my alarm
Word minus bond, this is what they waiting on
Haters y'all keep hating on, most just love the way I slay a song
And every stage I'm on
I do it with no make up on
Been married to this here since '04
You can't break our bond, I made it strong
Built to last y'all until the day I'm gone
And if its the dark ages of rap, well here's the break of dawn
Its a new day, like record stores on Tuesday
Mama told me wack shit is the devil, Bobby Bushay
Excuse me, cutting past these rapper talking nonsense
About how they're God next
You corny crowns and makin' bomb threats
But you ain't blowing up shit, except your own ego
Until it pops and you drop and your throwin a fit
With your career cold in a ditch
No choice but calling it quits
It's over that's it
Don't worry its for your own benefit
Trick

[Verse Two: Grynch]
I never sacrifice my own self to follow trends
What you see is what you get that's how it always been
But some of y'all attend, you're hot for a year
12 months you got it all, now watch it all disappear
Surprise I'm still here
It ain't my fault you're not authentic
Fake it till you make it
Get naked without your gimmick
I fuck with Chucks, 501's, and my Russel hoodies
Ask me, its how it should be
Extra shimmies, nothing to me
So what y'all gigging bout
Yeah, thats what I can live without
It don't affect the verdict when I propose I'm one of the sickest out
And when my pen is out it's never been a doubt
I take it like 40's marks and turn that shit dark; Guinness stout
No I ain't in a drought
Cats can say they better than
Me all they want but y'all word ain't worth the reticent
The flow is heaven sent
Been places you'll have never went
That's why you only catch me with the truth
Here's the evidence

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Brother Ali]
I be riding through my old hood
And I'm in the same whip
Number 5 city bus
"Ain't you famous?"
I used to feel great when they told me that I made it
Then got deflated when they spit and said he ain't shit
Nobody ever taught us how to grow
Must've missed that episode of that reality show
Like, one day you're po', the next day you blow
But what's between those two points, nobody know
It ain't but one, way to get something done
Put this here foot in front of that there other one
But TV made us so fucking dumb
How we can't seem to manage how to walk and chew out bubble gum
This is not a dance, it's a try, at the lawn
Just the track we're on until we die
Relay the message of the cats who gone
To the one coming next as we pass the baton
