(Hook)
Ain't no where to run to
There ain't nothing here for free

(Verse 1)
If I don't like my life I gut it and rebuild it
Fuck it, keep nothing but God and my children
I kill the devil wherever he resides
Even if he hiding in me he got to die
I killed little Jason he was only fifteen
Sewed his good traits together, made Ali
Filled his lungs with the Koran until he breathe
Let him walk but kept him on a short leash
Here he stand now, seventeen year old man-child
Ain't ask nobody for a muh-fuckin' hand out
He trying to carry heaven on his back
Jumped the broom with a stranger, he ain't never look back
What he know about how the world spin?
Bless his heart he a virgin, never even had a girlfriend
Want to be a man so bad that he can taste it
His family fell apart and he's tryin' to replace it
You'll find in him a heart that is second to none
But I know old soul that his lessons ain't done so
I stand willing to kill him again
If to grow he got to shed his skin then let it be done

(Chorus/Hook)
Ain't no where to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord
Ain't no where to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
You'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free

(Verse 2)
One half of all the two-leggeds on the scene are too timid to dream
'cause failure is far too depressing it would seem
So they take what's given
That's your decision, I just don't consider that livin'
Shit, if I'mma die whether or not I try
I might as well let the dice fly
I'm hot knife through butter in the night sky
It shouldn't take a genius to see this hunger in my eye
So I use blood and sweat to butter my bread
'cause this cold world couldn't give a fuck if I'm fed
I ain't curled up in my bed
If I don't set the world ablaze trust it ain't 'cause of nothing I did
Listen, I don't think God's obligated to touch you
If your ass would rather live in shit than work a shovel
I refuse to let the sun set on me again
'til the end I'm a one man army, friend

(Chorus/Hook)
Ain't no where to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord
Ain't no where to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
You'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free
Ain't no where to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord
Ain't no where to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
