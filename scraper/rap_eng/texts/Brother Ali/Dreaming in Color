[Verse 1]
I don't beg nobody pardon to be confident
I'm just saying my shit didn't exist until I did it
I'm the one that's suffered for the politics that I done spit
I ain't quit, I hit every continent and bodied it
School of hard knocks equipped and I ain't get a scholarship
Bet I had it poppin' since hip hop was on that power fist
Then when y'all got counterfeit, I switched and did the opposite
Now I'm on some outsider shit, ain't that about a bitch
I ain't never lied about what my skin is, it's obvious
I'm just so obsessed with bringin power to the powerless
I insist; I would never operate on cowardice
Rather chop my wrist than be afraid to take this kind of risk
Every single line I ever spit, I put it on my kids
On my blood, on my tears
All that pain, all them fears
All them shows, all them years
I was chose for this here
Maybe I'm a dreamer that's exactly what my problem is
But when I do dream, believe I see it all too clear
You can keep your money, I just wanted y'all to hear
And remember...ugh...

[Verse 2]
Thank heaven for blessin me with a heavy flow
Twelve years old, I was already hella professional
Let it go, follow the regular road, hell no
Listen close to my own/ heart like a stethoscope
Wrote myself an episode/ set it and lettin 'em fold
Turned over every stone/ better than ever before
And every sentence I wrote/ shot it direct for your throat
Made every effort to blow/ you best be ready to go
????? never get the doe/ should've known
Didn't piss and moan/ bit my lip, when out and built my own
Hit the road and did the globe/ so many times I've lost count
Time that I done been at home/ and didn't recognize my house
Doctor said  I shouldn't perform/ I just tuned 'em all out
Temperature 104/ rhyme 'til I fall out
I destroyed my vocal chords/ I'mma stand tall and shout
Never let it go/ until they know what I'm bout
I give it all and ain't never runnin out
If you listen close I'll teach you what this love's about
Just remember...

[Verse 3]
Y'all know I ....Got that mic
On a mic/ all my life/ drop it like
Glowing out my eyes at night
Come on now what's right is right
Always say it's darkest right before the dawn
Come on write/ Till I reach my highest height
I'll not go out without a fight
Bear witness I gets it in/ tear them bitches limb from limb
Carry this through thick and thin and just jump in and sink or swim
Ain't nobody realer than/ realest always recognize
Best believe the slouchers that doubt me just keep me energized
They hold me in cages but my soul is only strengthened
My whole vocation, I rose to those occasions
Growing short of patience/ my ultimate motivation
And no I don't expect no open invitation
But you gon' have to go bed just knowing that you're hating
You're ignoring greatness; that's no exaggeration
Allow me to stretch your imagination
Any way you look at it this shit is amazing
Remember..who we are..
