[Hook]
I need a knot whether the bread is for me or not
I need a knot whether the bread is for me or not
I need a knot whether the bread is for me or not
Show me the spot

[Verse 1]
I had to get paper use to move white
Did it 24/7 morning noon night
Had to hit the block early in my true life
Scraping on the concrete in the moonlight

Powerful supply got that powder from the sky
I could always get it where you want it by tonight
Love the fluffy white but I take it wet and hard
Push it off the sidewalk dump it in the yard

I’m a hustler, was cold blooded
All my customers their nose running
Got my muscles up pitching whole bundles
I ain’t selling cocaine I had a snow shovel

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I use to chop green put it in a bag
Up and down the street let my money stack
They knew every week that I was coming back
No sticks kept it clean right and exact

Talking green sticky never brown crispy
Worse thing for my paper was when the drought hit me
I know my mama know because my pockets swoll
Soon as I walk through the door she smell it on my clothes

But I got to roll keep it pushing hot or cold
I gas it up I’m hitting every house on the road
Got to get it how I live I’m going hard for it
It ain’t no marijuana man I push a lawn mower

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
When I was sixteen I had crew of girls
Get them clean send them off out into the world
Use to come and see the kid to get their head right
Shorty talk all you want to just get my bread right

Never split the ends wasn’t nothing soft
Had to get some trim then I cut them off
You know I bend their back I kept them in them tracks
You got some new growth baby better bring them stacks

Steady go upside her head but she can’t complain
I run that same old game baby no pain no gain
You got some paper and you trying to see some cuties holler
I ain’t a pimp I’m sweeping hair up at the beauty parlor

[Hook]
