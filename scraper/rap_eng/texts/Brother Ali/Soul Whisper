My brothers in the plight
Who ain't got your head right
Too many people shed blood
For us not to shed light
We hot we dead right
We drop we take mics
We run these streets
Like cops through red lights

We shine so bright
We learn the life
We high beams in rearview
Weaving through the traffic just to see you
Man's truth living is lost
By the time you hear this when your position is took

My brothers in the plight
Who ain't got your head right
Too many people shed blood
For us not to shed light
We hot we dead right
We drop we take mics
We run these streets
Like cops through red lights

Bismillahirahmaanirahim
Rabbana la tuzigh quloobana
BaAAda ith hadaytana
Wahab lana min ladunka rahmatan innaka anta alwahhabu
Rabbana atina fee alddunya hasanatan
Wafee alakhirati hasanatan
Waqina AAathaba alnnari
Astaghfurhallah al azeem kaffeer
