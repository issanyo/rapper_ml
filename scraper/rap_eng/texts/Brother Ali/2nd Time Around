[Wale]
You gotta understand man
Personifying hip-hop
Try to

[Verse 1: Wale]
I rely on no man, but him that's speakin'. Him that lead him
Bleed on a track, like a pole vault freakish
Accident victim. Meanwhile beatin' up the beat via Benzi
Haters eyes gettin' wide like bench seats
I bring Maybach. You getter get me
Wale, yeah. All them haters get me
Osmosis, now niggas get me
I spit that halitosis. You got Listerine
I'm that extreme, So haters complain
So Blame It On my Rain. You all lip sync
Wale: I turn beef into mince meat
Your condescending ways don't convince me
And I didn't know what condescending meant till yesterday
So I threw it in a rap so I'd remember that
Yeah, it ain't nothin' to me
I play the background whole time Mario 3
Gone

[Hook: X8]
Second Time around

[Brother Ali]
Ha. It's Brother Ali. Hey Benzi my man. You gotta forgive me
I might go a little long. I got some shit I gotta get off my chest right now
Bring it back for me

[Verse 2: Brother Ali]
Rappers can't clap me
Jackers can't gat me
Original meaning of Jazzy Fat Nasty
I don't bite rapper's lines, I bite the captain's arm off
I don't throw shots in the air, I throw that Molotov
Cocktail, reservoir dog my collar off
Y'all scared to get that revolution popping off
You really got the guns you claim in the track
Then my question to you is who you aiming 'em at
You complain that the rap police caught you with a gat under the seat
Misdemeanored that twenty bag of weed
But little old me with the few facts that I speak
The homeland security gaffeled me over seas
Froze my bank account and seized my guarantee
And y'all are soundscanning like a hundred more than me
They kicking you off tour for freaking a chick or two
Verizon dissed me too cause I was too political
Y'all are all safe and shit, y'all are not saying shit
You just snap your fingers and dance and make your label rich
Gotta pay back that advance, so they ain't gave you shit
This is your chance to say something and you're wasting it
People are starving, you talking bout balling
Can't think of nothing more important than that jargon
Hundred different ways to describe diamonds sparkling
Eighty percent of kids are listening to y'all shit
I heard that statistic I almost cried
Never wanted so bad for 2pac to be alive
What the fuck happened to rap when
The gangsters are scared of upsetting they industry masters
It ain't my place to say and I hear all that
But fuck that, I live in the hood and we need y'all cats
So as soon as I hear y'al on some real pro black
Then I will gladly go back to my emo rap
They say the truth don't belong to nobody, if you see it you speak it
It would be a sin to keep it a secret
So if I need to breathe then believe that I mean it
Quit trying to be somebody's boss and be a leader
If it wasn't bad enough your labels are hoeing you
You can't even scan, your fans are downloading you
There's no connection, so they're not supporting you
You ain't never shed light on nothing that they're going through
We ain't buying CDs, we striving to live
And these artists don't need me they already rich
I ain't hating on you, rock them shines
Just remember us from time to time when you drop them lines
Rappers can't clap me
Jackers can't gat me
Original meaning of Jazzy Fat Nasty
Busy raising babies and living on tour
Signing off Brother Ali, sincerely yours
