[Sample: George Carlin]
Forget the politicians
The politicians are put there to give you the idea
That you have freedom of choice
You don't
You have no choice
You have owners
They own you
They own everything

[Verse One: Bambu]
Yo, I've been enlightened before 1700
Illuminati, not me
I'm from the jungle
Sword-swinging people who could measure the sun
And harness power from the land before the Spanish would come
I don't need Bavarian methods or secret societies
I can see that there's a power out suppressing the colonies
Let's call it Mickey D's, and Nestle, and Pepsi, and Coca-Cola
Call 'em Wal-Mart, and Rupert Murdock, big-money-holders
Fuck a triangle children, they got logos galore
No need the "eye above the pyramid", just walk to the store
You are controlled by the dollars, and pigs on patrol
So getting free's far beyond where the measly charities goal
If I leave the earth old enough to see a spark get lit
And I can raise my family in the means I see fit, shit
I don't need no conspiracies
The poli-tricking politicians poppin' right in front me

[George Carlin]
They own all the important land
They own and control the corporations
They long since bought and paid for
The senate, the congress, the statehouses
They've got the judges in their back pockets
And they own all the big media companies
So they control just about all the news and information you get to hear
They gotchya by the balls
They spend billions of dollars every year, lobbying...
Lobbying to get what they want

[Verse Two: Brother Ali]
Tell me what's the difference if it's the "Illuminati"
Or the Bilderberg Group who put the shit up in the fruit?
Instead of nit-picking the religion of the truth
Just to sit and be the realist theorist in the room
I'll tell you what the truth is, new shit
The proof is: a slow motion youtube clib with scary music
Believing these officials would be foolish
But info with no action is useless
Trying to open eyes, organize, and build power
I know all about the hell I'm trying to get out of
Two million dollars on sister Assata's head
It's when you really get it poppin' that they want you dead
It's the information age, that ain't what we're lacking
It's the heart and the backbone to make it happen
I love knowlege, never patronize that
But what we need to know is where your sacrifice at, Jack

[George Carlin]
Well we know what they want!
They want more for themselves, and less for everybody else
But I'll tell you what they don't want:
They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking
They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking
They're not interested in that
That doesn't help them
That's against their interests

[Bambu]
Look: while you was zoned out on Infowars
Outside your kinfolk got smoked, Po-Po had him in a figure-4
Between the rich and poor, yes y'all in a civil war
So imagine me let these Hitlers make me feel insecure
Why would you let cowards who operate in the shadows have you
Studying skull and bones, now you feelin' vulnerable
Meanwhile the bullet-holes, and projects hallways
Hoods serve as symbolism themselves
From them my vision is sell
Not as in blood sale even though young-blood fell
I'm talkin' 'bout a four by four
Youngins' up for sale
Sound like some trap shit to me, did that recon
And that's the only trap shit you'll ever hear me speak on
[Bambu]
That's why I don't worry about reptilians and shape-shifters
We already got enough snakes and fakes who switch up
The city alone look like a snake-pit Matrix
Mixed with complacency, watched by C. I. Agency
That's the least of my issues, though I got seeds to raise
Plus, powers that be playin' a game of keep-away
To keep our freedom and people at bay the distance shows
That crimes against us never pop by coincidence, oh
You think I'm lying?
It's right there on the fucking news
Read between 100 lies, stop acting like you fucking knew

[Bambu]
Illuminati, not me, I'm on my own shit
