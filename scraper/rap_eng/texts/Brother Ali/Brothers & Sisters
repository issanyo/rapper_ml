Brothers and sisters
The world we share is filled with such despair
And such pain

We're a people at odds with our very own selves
The rich neglect the poor
The young resent the old
We're divided by race, divided by religion

Our politicians rob us and our leaders fail us
I think it's safe to say that we are our only hope

Our speaker tonight is a soldier in the war for love
He carries with him a message of true hope and true peace
I pray that you will listen with open hearts and open minds
Brothers and sisters
Put your hands together and welcome Brother Ali
