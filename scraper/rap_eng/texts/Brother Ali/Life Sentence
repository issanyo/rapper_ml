[Chorus]
Streams roll into the ocean
Rivers roll into the sea
If I can't sing my life one of y'all might got to come and bury me

Streams roll into the ocean
Rivers roll into the sea
If I can't sing my life one of y'all might got to come and bury me

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, the flow here is so real
Won't hear me so bare and vocals nowhere
No hood up or robe, post golden years
My most sincere quotes I unload 'em here
Your local hero don't compare
No, yeah, don't you dare hold a mirror to me
That's no fair
You ain't gotta do your poker stare over here
Honestly don't care what cards you holdin' there

Most my heroes don't even compete with me
I'm on my own kinda sucker free frequency
I got a IQ I refuse to speak beneath
And to lie to you would only cheapen me

Seem to me most these dudes are car poolin'
One of y'all do somethin' new and then you all do it
Havin' deja vu
They enjoy something Jay-Z do, then either sample it or say it too

I guess we wasn't taught the same rules
I was brought up bitin' is a sin you gotta pay your dues
That's for underground and mainstream too
The blame's on you bitches, shame on you

[Chorus]
Streams roll into the ocean
Rivers roll into the sea
If I can't sing my life one of y'all might got to come and bury me

Streams roll into the ocean
Rivers roll into the sea
If I can't sing my life one of y'all might got to come and bury me

[Verse 2]
I should only have to tell y'all once
Only come back just to prove it to ya
Never had to (punch) through my track misconfused
On my particular brand of truth is undisputed
It's a fact - stupid people dig stupid ass music and that
Labels suit seven out of ten humans
Huntin' cats in the underground movement

I do exactly what I wanna do and I'm building one room at a time
Damn the blueprint and I'm
Doing just fine in my own mind
Trying to be one of the greatest of all time
If you ain't doin that you wasting your time
I shake the floorboards til the foundation whine

You know nothing bout what it takes to shine
Do an about face and holler out "peace, goodbye!"
I'm a star in the evening sky
Got the sun in my hand and the fire in my eye, Lord!

[Chorus]
Streams roll into the ocean
Rivers run into the sea
If I can't sing my life one of y'all might got to come and bury me

Streams roll into the ocean
Rivers run into the sea
If I can't sing my life one of y'all might got to come and bury me
