[Hook x2]
Said the devil got his arms around you
In the spot where the love ain't found you
It's so weak, but it's so dang powerful
I'd pull you out, but I don't know how to

[Verse 1]
My daddy on that medicine
I guess the demons are dancing in his head again
Many women tried to breeze through and rescue him
What they all seem to see
Trying to get a thin screen between you and your agony
Strangling your anger 'til it settles at apathy
Have you seeing scenes that nobody should have to see
Shadowy screams of your own humanity
I feel the melancholy moan of a troubled soul
That somehow could never know that it weren't alone
If he took a swig of gin, it would always grip him in
And he'd sink until he drowned in that undertow
Till the day he sat and scribbled out that rugged note
Said "everything I ever touched, it went up in smoke."
Apologized to his woman, didn't know her heart
Doesn't love any less pure just because it's broke

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You better tell them you love them and make them believe you
Get between your people and that needle before they leave you
Tell them something when you look them in the eye
Before you can't say nothing but goodbye

[Outro]
Said the devil got his arms around you
