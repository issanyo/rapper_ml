[Verse One: YZ]
Did I ever tell you I was a rock star?
Audi’s & Benz’s all park in my garage
Two friends that come over for manage a trois
Some real niggas that make up my entourage
You see me singing this thing you think it’s all mirage
I got a castle on the hill the game is all panache
A big suite in the front for my ma ma ma
And big screens so I can see some Sha Na Na
A indoor pool to dive in I keep it warm
Your game’s a turn off B see mine I keep it on
You play in this game and sleep it will so you wrong
You got to gorilla this thing I’m a show you all
That hiatus I was on I was stacking chips
I let the weak fall off came back when I was fit
In shape now Mayweather of this rap thing
Ain’t no mistaking my moves see I’m the rap King
I’m instrumental to the rap Game I’m monumental
Go do you history B go check on my credentials
I let y'all eat I hope you had a good meal
It’s braggadocio shit but see it’s all for real

Did I ever tell you I was a Rock Star?

[Verse Two: Slug]
Did I ever tell you I was a Rock Star?
Throwing up and passing out in back of cop cars
Somewhere between dirtball & avant garde
You heard the rumors Slug showed up and bought the bar
Read about me in the magazines
The tabloids want to know what happening
Doing anything to get my hands on that cream
Then burn it up like my limousine gasoline
Fuck love tell me what I need a wifey for
I go on tour cause the groupies all like me more
I’m like a whore girl now bite the floor
Won’t even tell you bout the story from the night before
Watch me study me see me fly
I don’t care man I swear I’m a reach the sky
Everybody hates life but I feel alright
Stay bent cause my management keeps me high
Got enough charisma to pass the test
She gonna smile while I autograph the breast
Paparazzi better step back and show respect
Or I’m a sock the damn camera man in his neck
Look mama I’ve reached my goals
First class suites and hoes
Cars and links and rings and clothes
With my fame and my fortune who needs to sew
Oh

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Brother Ali]
Quick Question
Did I ever tell you I was a Rock Star?
You never quite get it right I’m a rap Star
Kangol bucket half cocked listening to Ad Rock
Four letter fast talk, dripping out my chatter box
No bank account in my name I got a stash box
20 grand underneath the mattress and a black Glock
I’m the have nots mascot everyday plan and plot
Trying to get my hands on what the haves got
Ah
I ain’t  rich but I’m bad and enjoy the shit out the lil’ bit that I have
I know I got it all never kissing no ass
And punching time clocks is just a thing of the past
Blame Rhymesayers for creating a monster
True official Rock Star amongst you impostors
Turned down the sponsors turned up my collar
If I make a jam about you best believe you’ll win an Oscar
Charles D Dutton you nuts
Cause I do it out of nothing but my love and respect
But if I love the way I catch a publishing check
Can’t blame a star for shining what the fuck you expect
You know I’m globally known but the more that I roam
The more that they support at home
Got a life size poster in the store that we own
Lit up on Hennepin so I can always be shown
Couple rap legends like to blow up my phone
I ain’t sold out nothing but the shows that I’ve thrown
Permanent soul glowing I'm holding my own
I’m in The Source and The Rolling Stone
Now let me tell you bout me
Ah

[Hook]
