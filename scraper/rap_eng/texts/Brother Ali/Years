[Verse One]:
A bottle of wine and two glasses
Potato salad and that old picnic basket
Sunday afternoon spread a blanket
For so many years that we tend to lose track of it
Those years turn dreams into memories
Much oblige for every one you spent with me
Can't believe the kids that were at our feet
All moved out and began their
Own family
It still feels like just yesterday
I stood in that mirror practicing what to say
Just know when I live for the moment
My eyes glowed, held out my hand and
Felt yours on it
You don't know the power a touch like that
You have on a
Lovestruck lad
Everything I ever used to care about fade to the back
I feel that way to this day, matter of fact

[Hook]:
Laughter and tears we had through the years
Like magnets, attract without fear
The sun, light that magically appeared
I recall it all and I'm glad that you're here
Laughter and tears we had through the years
The feeling of companion is near
The first touch, that can't be compared
I recall and I'm glad that you're here

[Verse Two]:
That old tree witnessed the first love we made
I pulled out my pocket knife, gave it my name
But like all trees, he went and grew rings
And that carving got harder to read from far away
And the stress of this world, it pressed you
Made you forget you possessed something special
And all of this mess
You tended to neglect the blessing that slept directly next to you
So I'm painfully ignored by a girl masquerading as the lady I adore
And even though I lived as your husband
I can't help missing the kiss I fell in love with
What was once hugging and kissing
One day made way to fussing and
Bickering
Now cussing and no one's listening
We lost all grip on love in the midst of it

[Hook]:
Laughter and tears we had through the years
The challenges you have interfere
The heartbreak and anguish we share
I recall it all and I'm glad that you're here
Laughter and tears we had through the years
We snapped and reacted out of fear
Broken promises can't be repaired
I recall it all and I'm glad that you're here

[Verse Three]:
Those things that we say when we argue
Never go away, they become part of you
Furthermore with every new scar it grew
Ever harder to open my heart to you
I need you to believe me when I tell you that
I didn't step out on you to get
You back
I was just hungry for affection that the first time another gave attention, I was in the trap
I let her stand in for you
Trying to recapture the magic that I knew
That's why I fell for it because
When she held me in her arms, I pretended they were yours
I don't fault you for being mad at me
We were a family, I put you through a tragedy
Can't blame you for losing sanity
Rolling me over in my sleep and stabbing me

[Hook]:
Laughter and tears we had through the years
Every time our anniversary nears
You show up with a picnic basket and a beer
I recall it all and I'm glad that you're here
Laughter and tears we had it appears
The best talk I've had with you in years
I'm right here where you lay my casket my dear
I'll save you place and catch you when you're here
