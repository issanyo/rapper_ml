[Verse 1]
Love struck like dumb luck
See the bite marked heart come untucked
Still scared of the dark yet Iâ€™m not
'fraid to fall scale the wall that you construct
Must be the tears of joy that appeared
Rose from the morsel of soul that you bared
Crawled out of your stare Warm to my ears
Cause oh's and yeah's are all I can hear
Every wish is a prayer
Each glistening tear whispers in the ear
Convening clouds that linger in the atmosphere
Leading places for the blissfully sincere
'Fore long although sorrows overflow
Horizon no longer holds all our woes
Roll down throw out the cold ground below
Sky glows golden the whole garden grow

[Hook]
This oath I bestow
Triplet of tones spoken mighty slow
Echo a language from a long time ago
Trust me I know you don't even know
You're not ready
You're not ready
You're not ready
You're not ready

[Verse 2]
In the vein of an instant
Love takes us from strangers to intimate
Some day you might change what the distance is
But love can't be unmade once you witness it
Miracles, science can't quite describe
Against all odds we arrive
Immaculate hearts and clean slate minds
Mysterious souls that keep poets inspired
Marvelous mankind, wonderful woman
Each invited to the world through an act of loving
Even if they were only acting to be loving
The search of love's the origin of our becoming
And it becomes clear, two souls obliviously twist in the air
DES-tine he tried to get us here
I hit you with the stare that was written somewhere
[Hook]
