Intro: Brother Ali]
Bismillah, ya Allah, I make this a song about
About witnessing God through healing
And let it be what it is, I turn it over to you
Love, love, love

[Hook: Brother Ali]
I'm tired of crying
Destroying and building
I'm done denying
I'm removing the ceiling
My whole life I've been dying
I'm getting busy living
I feel like I'm flying
I'm not asking permission

[Post-Hook: Brother Ali]
There's a cost for loving, it's the cost of living
Don't remorse for nothing, I just pray I'm forgiven
The telephone's ringing, and the past is calling
It don't offer me nothing, don't ignore it, just listen

[Verse 1: Brother Ali]
Survival tactics are perfect for survival mode
But they no longer serve a purpose once your life goes on
That suffering will always be a part of me
But to serve suffering, is idolatry
Shout out to Liza Garza, Samir and Aja Black
Respect to Shaykh Hamza, one day I'll pay y'all back
What I learned my thirty-sixth time around the track
I'm hugging every single curve, never looking back
Pain is a revelation, what a scar is revealing
Gone but not forgotten, thank God for healing
Maybe the blessing that I'm missing in Salat is kneeling
To to return me to my feet, I forgot that feeling

[Hook: Brother Ali]
I'm tired of crying
Destroying and building
I'm done denying
I'm removing the ceiling
My whole life I've been dying
I'm getting busy living
I feel like I'm flying
I'm not asking permission

I'm not asking permission
I'm not asking permission
I feel like I'm flying
I'm not asking permission
I'm not asking permission
I'm not asking permission
It's the feeling of flying

[Verse 2: Brother Ali]
I'm acquainted with shame, I hated my name
I validated their claims and I stayed in my lane
I'm mistaking the chain, thought it was a lifeline
Just because it's been around me all my lifetime
Success meant the world kinda felt out of tilt
Survivor guilt made me try to kill what I had built
And despair felt just like loyalty
I saw betrayal and the day feel joyfully
I done cried the blues, 'til my eyes refused
To make water for sorrow too dry to produce
I was tryna get loose, I climbed out of that noose
Now how could I accuse, the Most High of abuse?
I got a hole in my soul that the pain dug
And now I let it overflow when the rain comes
It's the bittersweet taste when I make love
I can't trust it'll be there when I wake up

[Hook: Brother Ali]
I'm tired of crying
Destroying and building
I'm done denying
I'm removing the ceiling
My whole life I've been dying
I'm getting busy living
I feel like I'm flying
I'm not asking permission

I'm not asking permission
I'm not asking permission
It's the feeling of flying
I'm not asking permission
I'm not asking permission
I'm not asking permission
It's the feeling of flying

[Post-Hook: Brother Ali]
There's a cost for loving, it's the cost of living
Don't remorse for nothing, I just pray I'm forgiven
The telephone's ringing, and the past is calling
It don't offer me nothing, don't ignore it, just listen

[Hook: Brother Ali]
I'm tired of crying
Destroying and building
I'm done denying
I'm removing the ceiling
My whole life I've been dying
I'm getting busy living
I feel like I'm flying
I'm not asking permission

It's the feeling of flying
It's the feeling of flying
It's the feeling of flying
