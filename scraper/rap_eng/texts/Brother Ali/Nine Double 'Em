[Intro]
Rat-ta-tat, rat-ta-tat, rat-ta-tat, tatta rat-ta-ta-tatta to make his blood
Splatter (x4)

[Verse 1]
You jacking me? You got the wrong season
You got your piece, I got my piece
And all I need now is a reason, for me to start squeezing
Matter of fact, give me your rings, watch, and your house keys
And make it fast shorty, or I'mma put gun smoke, up in the breeze
And I'm glad he ain't call my bluff, because I ain't really had my gat
It wouldn't have been nothing, for him, to peel back
My wig, he saw this piggy go, wee-wee all the way home
To get my chrome, because now I got to lock some shots off in that dome
(Why's that?) Because my manhood has got to stay intact
He can't just play me out, in front of the ladies, that shit is wack
But now I got my gat, back down in the downtown district
Dying to spill some gravy on this mother{*cough*} biscuit
Seen him kicking it out on Nicklet, like it was nothin'
Go around the block one more time, and I swear to God I'm dumpin'
Looked over my shoulder, know this was the time and the place
I jumped out the car, unloaded the nine up in his face!
With no feelin', peelin' out, tires all squeelin'
Adrenalin to my brain, got me higher than the ceilin'
But people talk, I'll probably never get dissed again
And Minnesota got ten thousand lakes, to dump the pistol in

[Hook]
Woah
Wa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang, listen to my nine millimeter go bang (Go-o bang!) (x3)

Wa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang, listen to my nine millimeter go bang

[Verse 2]
I ran home quick, changed my clothes and dipped in my lady's Trans-Am
If they ask you where I am don't tell em shit
You ain't seen me or heard from me; she asked where I would go
I said: "You know I'mma go stay with grandma down in Chicago
I know how fast your car go, way up over a hundred
But I can't get caught speeding, I might be federally wanted"
Man them cops be on it, I can't afford to get sloppy
Cause if I slip up at any single point, yo they got me
So I rock the accelerator never greater than limit
Thinking strictly about my journey, what I did, still hasn't hit me
I touch down in the Chi, grandma stay on Southside
Just trying to get some rest after that eight hour drive
And Grandma surprised, but always happy to see me
So I'm kicked up at the rest, playing Nintendo, watching T.V
And believe me, I know that I'm still on the run
But I'm happy that this part of the ghetto way is done
Because I:

[Verse 3]
Yo, it's kind of hard to live with what I did
Because everytime I close my eyes, all I see is me blasting that kid
But yo, I did exactly what I had to do
If that was him in my shoes; he would've blasted me too
Besides, everybody's mamma cry sometime
And you know everyone got to die sometime
And grandma said I had a cousin in Minnesota, that I ain't even know about, you know
And just last week, he got his brains blown out
And so his little funeral was being held today
I'm dressed in black Versacci, and mad respect I pay
But whoever shot my cousin, sure wet up that po' bastard
Because the wake and the funeral was strictly closed casket
But yo, they had his picture on the program, and oh damn
They had his picture on the program, and oh damn
Stared at my cousin on that program, and I couldn't even speak
That's the kid that I shot last week
