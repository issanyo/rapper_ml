[Hook]:
"Mountain made up of memories
A mountain is made up of memories
It's just to hard to tear on down
A mountain is made up of memories
It's just to hard to tear on down
Whooooooo!
A mountain is made up of memories
It's just to hard to tear on down"

[Verse One: Donny Goines]
This is my Everest
My mind Exodus
Text in the Bible, disciple of my very Genesis
Playing Sonic on my Genesis
Family was never rich but we tried to make the best of it
Three of us in a bunk bed
No one care, wasn't much there
Only one pair of new sneakers that I must wear for one year
Had a whole lot of hand-me-downs
Father wasn't there and he can't be found
No family around to help me out
It was just my mama she held me down
Picked on in junior high
It was do or die, couldn't lose my life
Before I hit 18 I was brutalized
This made me come to school with knives
Only got worse when brew inside
Couldn't lose my prize to a suicide
But I figured that I'm a wild juvenile
And that was life or death, had to choice a side
So I bought a nickle plated
To curse my pistols blazing
Middle fingers in the air, that's a simple statement
Fuck the world, no protection, let's infect the nation
Though it's close to home cause I've been trippin', pacin'

[Verse Two: Brother Ali]
It go banana [?] and corn bread
Sweet potato pie
Kiss me on my eyes when I would think I'm 'bout to cry
Taught me how to fly when I was just a little guy
Put it in this pile, pretty visions in my mind
Deep hatred and cynicism made me blind
I was degraded in plenty instances in time
The things they said were clouds littering my sky
Till the sweet angels whispered to me, gave me sight
The way they cared about me is what taught me wrong and right
Wisdom they departed gave me heart when it was time to fight
Every round I fought you literally get brought to minds
Baby just be strong, the greatest love song of all time
Seeing how your life will flash before you when you die
I pray that the directors cut is what gets shown for mine
Wonder why all my pain, it always stayed to the background
A mountain of memories you gave me is my crown
Love
