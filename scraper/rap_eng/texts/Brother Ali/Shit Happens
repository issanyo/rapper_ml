Intro (Brother Ali speaking):
I have this dream all the time shit. Everybody has sex dreams
Mine, you know they gotta be fucked up at the end
Like get caught cheatin' and shit
I can't keep my shit right. I can't. So far that is

Chorus:
Be careful, what you pray for
Cause you just might get it and it might come true
Nine times out of ten you're not prepared for
How to react if it happens to happen to you
Be careful, what you pray for

Cause you just might get it and it might come true

Nine times out of ten you're not prepared for

How to react if it actually happens to you

Verse One:
Tours is like Ground Hog Day
Everyday is exactly the same
And don't shit change but the Hanes and the name of the cities that we're rappin' in
Set the Kool-Aid stand up and hope to pack them in
One day this lady got caught in my eye
Like Rosario Dawson standin' off to the side
Please
My post show game is none other
Gentleman mack, elderly cat stalk the young Brother
Who did you steal this section of the floor from?
Underground rap show she stuck out like a sore thumb
She write for whatever-the-fuck magazine
And she got up on the guest list just to come and check this
Artist that she heard about
Word-A-Mouth
Little did she know she could bat her eyes and turn 'em out
Here's me
Forrest Whitaker, pretty baby maker
Never mind I've been wearing these same pants for three days

Chorus [X2]

Verse Two:
Don't get me wrong
It's not in my personality to cheat
But I'm a charming motherfucker in my sexual peak
And I swear to God it's not done out of greed
Intelligence ?, y'all see where this is gonna lead
I've just seen the bootie in it's natural habitat
But never as fat as that
Shit god damn
She can't even keep the elastic back of her jacket down
Shit, she came across the street and made a clappin' sound
Got hips like the holsters of a gunslinger
One thing touchin' her thing will make your nuts tingle
Send a shiver up the middle of your spinal cord
Lettin' your mind explore that's what the vagina's for
Humpin' it like I got up in the Final Four
On a wild card, double team and it's time to score
Let a primal roar like a fuckin' dinosaur
And filled her with a pint or more of fine white slime dijour!
But once the life juice leaves your little head
It makes your big one want to take back everything you said
And now I can never look my kids in the eye
I would probably rather die then to live this lie

Chorus [X2]
