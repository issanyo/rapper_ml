[Intro]
I was turnt up off the interview I did with Nardwuar
I took the records home that he gave me
And made a beat out of it
Matter fact, made a whole song
Check it out

*Nardwuar*: Who are you?
*Brother Ali*: I am Brother Ali, sir
*Nardwuar*: Brother Ali, welcome to Vancouver
British Columbia, Canada
*Brother Ali*: Thank you, I've been waitin' all my life
To hear you say that, man

[Hook]
They say baby, you're not a star
You're too underground and avantgarde
Can't nobody tell you how hot you are
When you're chillin' with motha fuckin' Nardwuar (Brother Ali)

[Verse 1: Brother Ali]
I've been around the world a couple times
TSA know my name, and let me cut the line
I'm tired of the scanner, could you please keep the back
Of your hand off my groin and my butt this time?
My cell phone full of heroes
Underground rappers, activists and weirdos
Chuck D, Cornell, rest immortal, jack
I got Lupe's joint, but I ain't phone him yet
(Have you met Mos Def?)
Let me tell you what my game about
Ten years, and my flame never faded out
I, and I ain't never had to go the major route
I drive six joints, they all sold the same amount
'07 I was billboard 6-9, same sales, but im 4-4 this time
So while the whole industry in a dick line
I didn't have to dick ride, and still sittin' just fine
(Oh my god)

[Hook]
They say baby, you're not a star
You're too underground and too avantgarde
Can't nobody tell you how hot you are
When you're chillin' with motha fuckin' Nardwuar

[Verse 2: Brother Ali]
I'm on tour again, hoppin' out the spinner van
I'm arrivin' early just to kick it with the fans
Hit the base, see the muslims, and visit and
I got a lot of fam, that's my man, 50 grand
Love to roll, but must admit I missed the fam
Hit the Minne up, just had to kiss the sam (Back to Minneapolis)
Breakfast at Victor's, and
[?] and [?] be the dinner plan
Australian, my toes all in the sand
SPF 50, man, albinos never get a tan
Hit the bead head, spin like a ceiling fan
I calm down off of Nina Simone's
Got my lady with me, tryin' be a different man
The ice blue ocean water got her in a trance
'Bout to get in that, none of y'all business
I took a glance in the mirror, then I did my dance, shit

[Hook]
They say baby, you're not a star
You're too underground and too avantgarde
Can't nobody tell you how hot you are
When you're chillin' with motha fuckin' Nardwuar

[Verse 3: Brother Ali]
Went from trashy to #teamclassy
My most lucrative years I was the least happy
First 2 of 'em we're me and B.K. comin' up
We had to sleep on the floor and split a hundred bucks
Every audience we saw tried to front on us
Had to shut 'em all up, and it was fun as fuck
Nowadays, it's like shopping with the trending team
Tryin' to find a happy medium is what I mean
(Keep on rockin' in the free world)
Voice all raspy, the big magazines no longer holler at me
Protests, and arrests all in my rap sheet
Homeland security file is my crammy
(Oh my god)
Beautiful women, always been attracted to 'em
Off the fact the music matters to 'em
So when they lift their shirt over they ribs
It's not to show me they tits, they took a quote that I spit
And got it tatted to 'em (That's an amazing fan)

[Hook]
They say baby, you're not a star
You're too underground and too avantgarde
Can't nobody tell you how hot you are
When you're chillin' with motha fuckin' Nardwuar
(This fella right here)
They say baby, you're not a star
You're too underground and too avantgarde
Can't nobody tell you how hot you are
When you're chillin' with motha fuckin' Nardwuar

[Outro]
*Nardwuar*: Brother Ali, have you bought your horse yet?
*Brother Ali*: I haven't bought a horse (laughing), I haven't bought a horse, but I, but I'm a lover of horses
*Nardwuar*: Why should people care about Brother Ali?
Why should people care?
*Brother Ali*: Oh man, yeah
(Nardwuar!)
*Nardwuar*: Thanks much Brother Ali, keep on rockin' in the free world, and doot doola doot doo
*Brother Ali*: Doot Doot
(Yeah!)
