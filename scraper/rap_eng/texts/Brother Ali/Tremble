[Verse]
I'm a man, not a brand
Heart knows no bar code that can be scanned
Revealing what can't be held up in the hand
Bearer of the standard that you cram to understand
Uncharted land telescopes can't discover
Can't throw it at strippers to make 'em pretend they love you
I sew the seed like fabric at the seams
You can't sip it to lean, but you can give it to fiends
The most taken for granted on the planet
You can't Snapchat it or Instagram it
It's from the unseen realm where the camera can't film
But the coal gets scorched into diamonds in the kiln
Created and evolved, the khaliq and the rabb
The sun, moon and the stars, Alhamdulillah
The biggest secret but you can't Wikileak it
Cause an unbroken chain transmit it to the seekers
Little mysteries bring the biggest victories
I'ma click the dhikr beads 'til I'm rid of this disease
We the breath of God that was left in charge
They dread the second we remember what we are

[Hook]
I tremble in the presence of it
I tremble at the mention of it
I tremble in the presence of it
I tremble at the mention of it
I tremble in the presence of it
I tremble at the mention of it
I tremble in the presence of it
I tremble at the mention of it

[Outro]
The infinite love that animate the finite
The necessary where the possible derive light
Uncreated majesty and mercy
Irrestible end of every journey
Allah
