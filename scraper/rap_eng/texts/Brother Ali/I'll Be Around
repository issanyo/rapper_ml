[Hook] [Phonte]:
The sun still shines and the birds still chirping
Bills all paid, baby everything working
Anything you need to see that I'm holding you down

[Verse One] [Phonte]:
Hey Ms. Thanga Thang
What's happening?
I've been all around world and forth and back again
And for you pretty ladies, normally I sing a song
But every now and then I like to do my rapper thang
It seems like lately you don't like the way I'm travelling
And all that's going through your mind is that it ain't the same
And even though I got you chilling where you wanna be
Right there, still you're having Nightmares like Dana Dane
Well consider this
It seems relationships today can be so hit or miss
I mean, wouldn't you say the same?
Cause even when I come home to be your Clark Kent
All you do is talk shit about them times I'm Superman
So whenever you get cabin
Fever just imagine
Yourself back in the club with them Orangutans
I mean them monkey ass niggas just hanging around
Maybe then you can appreciate my swanger thangs
Yes sir

[Hook] [Phonte]:
The sun still shines and the birds still chirping
Bills all paid, baby everything working
Anything you need to see that I'm holding you down (holding you down)
The music might stop but the party's not over
You my lucky star I'm your four leaf clover
Baby anytime you need me, you know I'll be around (I'll be around)

[Phonte talking]:
Ladies, I want yo to get a manicure to this one. If you're feeling really good, I want you to, huh, exfoliate to this one. Haha, yes I do. And if you feeling real nice I want you to get a pedicure to this one. All my fellas, huh, let's go

[Verse Two] [Brother Ali]:
I know them lonely
Nights get old and that bed get mighty cold
And the, weight of this family just be resting on your shoulder
You're a, Native New Yorker
Freezing to death in Minnesota for a man who almost always on the road
Woman such as you, she may wonder what to do
I know that possibility seem ugly but it's true
Now he's got his career but it's me that's sitting here
And you just might miss that something special that just for you
Well, my heart long for you when I'm gone from you
Just cause I'm not all up
Under you don't mean I don't love you
To the contrariety I've been on every continent
Trying to spit and get it right and get a house for you
That's why I'm globe trotting so often
I'm trying to put that glowing dot up in your horizon
Go to school, I pay tuition, new shoes, I gave the children
With a little
Smidgen left so we can go shopping
But if I'm so honest
All that paper
Don't mean nothing
When comparing to your loving and the care you give your
Husband
Wish I could lay up on your chest and hear your heartbeat
Whispering our name together as we fall asleep
The crowd cheering as I close the show
If they only know you only let me go cause you adore me so
And understand that I'm a natural man
Got to be who and what I am
Girl let me stand next to you

[Hook] [Phonte]:
The sun still shines and the birds still chirping

The music might stop but the party's not over

Baby anytime you need me, you know I'll be around (I'll be around)
