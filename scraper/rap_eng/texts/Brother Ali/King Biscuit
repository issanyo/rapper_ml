[Verse]
Y'all know me- Brother Ali
Kill 'em loudly or softly
He rolls with Los Nativos, Slug, Eyedea & Abilities, Musab[?]
It's the army
Y'all make a song about getting hated on
But it ain't about me
Just 'cause ya ain't ahead of your game
Don't be yellin' my name
On the shit that don't involve me
Don't call me
Any y'all cats want me
You can find me in the lobby
With my arm around your baby mom
Kissin' on her neck like "man, this is on me"
So salty
My metaphors two steps ahead of yours
And I'ma step ahead of you
Any other heads are booed
And I beckon you
That what you better do is let 'em through
Beggin[?]
Bone shuttering utterances
Other than this
It doesn't exist
I'm competitive and never lose

It's hell to anyone who wanna diss Ali
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my disc jockey
It's all about whether or not you rhyme nice
Don't care about the ice in your wristwatch

It's hell to anyone who wanna diss Ali
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my disc jockey
It's all about whether or not you rhyme nice
Don't care about the ice in your wristwatch FREEZE!

[Chants]
"Ali Bomaye!"
