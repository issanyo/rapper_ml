[Intro]
I just, I have a hard time .. sometimes tryin' to explain 'n' ......
Emotions .. so, so much sometimes .. and a .. I mean .. it's just kinda ..
I don't know man .. it's just the whole way that happend .. it's just ..

[Verse]
She had the brown west african features
She was lookin' sweet as peaches
On gorgeous spring day
With a thing to say
Little or no make-up
Covered her face up
But brother when she smiles
She light the whole place up
She was covered from the waist up
In a pastel pink scarf
She's soft
And Midas with the way that she talk
In my thoughts she kept me company when we
We're apart
Early on I felt that she would own a piece of my heart
Out of respect
I kept the distance in the physical
But moved in on the mental and emotional
'til she seem more approachable
So hopefull I had never been casanova
I had never been
She's probablly been approached by better men
But then again
I please the earth-citizen
She probablly like religious men
That's something that most are conciderin'
I sat back and thought about it
Then reflect
If I approach her with respect
Our roads have got to intersect
Ahhh
It got deeper said her name
Was Latifah, "Glad to meet cha
Heard you was a preacher
Maybe later we'll speak"
I felt numb, dizzy
Body tingelin', thinkin' what to say next
Ready to sign over my paychecks
No disguise
On the blessing
From her eyes
I was guessin'
She had been through
Enough to know the evil that some men do
I felt the pain
I be umbrella in the rain
Body yell the name
After that I never felt the same
She felt warm to me
Her eyes sang a song to me
She long for me
To touch her I can feel it
But too shy to reveal it
The strong attraction started creepin' in
We can spin together through the universe
But must become a unit first
We ain't had money for the big weddin receptions
But we had the real commitment
And the priceless connection
The mere mention of the name Latifah
Sent me deep into the ocean
With no scuba dive suit
This girl is potion(?)
When I'm in pain
All she has to do is put a hand on me
Y'all ain't understandin' me
She: bring out the man in me
She: ain't 'fraid to challenge me
She: know how to handle me
We: go build this a family
Strong up off reality
Together in the Jihad
We struggle hard to please god
With each and every aspect of life
We increase
And with each pass of year
It's more and more clear
That god is the reason that we're both still here
If we follow his directions
We're expectin' his protection
And I'm carving out a section
Of this earth for us to rest in
I'm strivin'
I'm never satisfied with just survivin'
Strivin' to provide a life in which our soul feels alright in
You're a priceless diamond
At your feet is where the paradise is lying
Even the nicest rhyme in the world couldn't explain
This is just my attempt to document
The blessin' that
Walked into my life one afternoon
I love you
