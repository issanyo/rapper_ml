"Z, and, G" {*Superfriends sound effect*}
We're living now in the nation of the lost
We're losing wars, losing children, losing jobs
Losing our minds, souls and our homes
We are lost but what we are not, is alone
The salvation our souls have cried out for is here
It stares us down quietly when we look in the mirror
Our heroes are us
The only superpower required, is love
So we're inviting you to submit your application
And become heroes, in the healing of a nation
