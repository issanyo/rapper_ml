Ain't nowhere to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
I don't like my life I gut it, rebuild it, fuck it
Keep nothing but God and my children
I kill the devil wherever he resides
Even if he hide under me he got to die
I killed little Jason he was only fifteen
Sowed his good traits together, made Ali
Filled his lungs with the Koran until he breathe
Let him walk but kept him on a short leash
Here he stand now seventeen year old man child
Ain't ask nobody for a motherfucking hand out
He trying to carry heaven on his back
Jumped the broom with a stranger, he ain't never look back
What he know about how the world spin?
Bless his heart he a virgin never even had a girlfriend
Want to be a man so bad that he can taste it
His family fell apart and he's tryin' to replace it
You'll find in him a heart that's second to none
But I know old soul that his lessons ain't done so
I stand willing to kill him again
If to grow he got to shed his skin then let it be done
Ain't nowhere to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free Lord
Ain't nowhere to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
You'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free
One half of all the two legged's on the scene are too timid to dream
'Cos failure is far too depressing it would seem
So they take what's given
That's your decision, I just don't consider that living
If I'm to die whether or not I try
I might as well let the dice fly
I'm hot knifed through butter in the nights sky
It shouldn't take a genius to see theres hunger in my eye
So I use blood and sweat to butter my bread
'Cos this cold world couldn't give a fuck if I'm fed
I ain't curled up in my bed
If I don't set the world ablaze trust it ain't 'cos of nothing I did
Listen I don't think God's obligated to touch you
If your ass would rather live in shit then workers shovel
I refuse to let the sun set on me again
'Til the end I'm a one man army, friend
Ain't nowhere to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free Lord
Ain't nowhere to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
You'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free
Ain't nowhere to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free Lord
Ain't nowhere to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
