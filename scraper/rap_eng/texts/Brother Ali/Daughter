Chorus [Prof]:
When you're out there in the woods
And finally find something you love
Better take what's yours

If I raised her all on my own
If you see her cry, sing a lullaby, yeah
You'll die when you see her fly when she's gone
Yeah

[Verse One] [Prof]:
Suck my dick get a facefull
Why can't Prof be all about the pesos?
I'm so unapologetic
I can give a shit about you chicken's little rhetoric
My girl don't take no shit
Try to put a muzzle on me then I'm burning a bridge
Motherfucker, respect my animal
Push me in a corner and I'll split your cantaloupe
All the haters that don't like my shit
If you really got a problem come and fight me bitch
Never before so many heads been talking
Like they can jump in my shoes and start walking
Everybody wants money where there ain't none
We'll see who's standing when the race done
I don't want to be found, I'm a needle
Privileged enough to be built by the people
That means I only got one boss
I see him every time I look in the crowd
I pledge my allegiance to them
This is Stophouse baby let the story begin

Chorus [Prof]:
When you're out there in the woods
And finally find something you love
Better take what's yours

If I raised her all on my own
If you see her cry, sing a lullaby, yeah
You'll die when you see her fly when she's gone
Yeah

[Verse Two] [Brother Ali]:
God God God given
You don't gotten follow my religion to recognize that I'm different
Can't contain it, grab it, tame it, chain, cage or enslave my dedication
No second place in the race to make it
Lace up your shoes for the marathon, chase it
Sweated on stage a decade and came close enough to wipe sweat off the face of greatness
Y'all got low expectations
Hit first place and start celebrating
Chest inflated, saying that you made it, pouring Gatorade on each other's faces
Waste of the space you take
What y'all call 'scraping' is our vacation
I was of the day where always creating
By yours truly, I literally make shift
Dictator haters take dick, but I don't give a fuck so they can't take shit
Prof, let me say and extra Minnesotan
I don't give a fuck ha ha roo roo

Chorus [Prof]:
When you're out there in the woods
And finally find something you love
Better take what's yours

If I raised her all on my own
If you see her cry, sing a lullaby, yeah
You'll die when you see her fly when she's gone
Yeah

[Verse Three] [Brother Ali]:
Hush baby, don't say a word
Don't you ever be afraid to surge
I watch you spread your wings and fly no matter how much it hurts
Single father, doubled as a mother
Kept her out of harms way, trouble never touch her
Never had nothing but each other
Whether we strive or suffer or thrive or go hungry
Nurtured and loved her to a full grown woman
Now ducks wanna jump up and try to rush her
Pardon my thug if it make wanna scuffle and make me knock the block off one of y'all motherfuckers

[Prof]:
Immaculate inception
I made her by myself when I was drunk
She spit, fuck, cuss like a motherfuck
She finally coming into her own
And now you wander up into my home
Talking about you want custody, leave us alone
La Di Da Di, we like to party
You can take her over my dead body

Chorus [Prof]:
If I raised her all on my own
If you see her cry, sing a lullaby, yeah
You'll die when you see her fly when she's gone
YeahLLLLLLLL
