[Hook]
To the drug dealers and killers
We the foundation, we the pillars
We the sound masons, we the realest
This is our nation and people feel us

[Verse 1: Jasiri X]
Allah Subhana Wa Ta'Ala, Honor over the dollar
I’m a future leader like John Connor who want drama nada, like Assata
I’ll emigrate to Cuba before I become a martyr, assassinate the shooter
Then blast away at your fashion plate and your jeweler
Then pull my mask away and evacuate with the moola
I’m deeper than playing Donny Hathaway on a tuba
Flash grenades from a trooper to fascinate your medulla
Master traits of a ruler, five pillars so my rhymes realer
Mind fillers, Fake gangsters are just time killers, I’m iller
I’ve got a virus in my sinus That makes me spit out the livest bars
Make you give up those lying frauds
And big up the wisest God
And lift up the righteous laws
We on top ‘cause we represent the highest cause
Freedom, justice, equality, Islam
See, I’m just an anomaly, pardon these spit bombs

[Hook x2]
Bang to the boogie, say up jumps the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie in my fitted in my hoodie, ah
Don’t ignore me, I’m still alive, support me so I can strive

Bang to the boogie, say up jumps the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie in my fitted in my hoodie, ah
Don’t ignore me, I’m still alive, support me so I can strive

[Verse 2: Brother Ali]
Riddle me this
How do we convince boys to be builders
When the tell-a-lie-visions/televisions, they destroyers of winners
Ignore us, till we make noise then they Emmitt Til us
Throw us in the pit with the bone chillingest killers
Parents, one parent, children ain’t childlike
Failure they stare at it, closing their eyes tight
Shame and embarrassment, straighten up, fly right
Campaign carelessness, can’t eat a sound bite
A lot broker then a stock broker
Broke broke like your promises, choke on accomplishments
They only get behind shit, the Heimlich
Make me throw up my hands ‘cause I’m sick
No boot straps to pull up too strapped for cash
Get your boots strapped and roll up, this here's a hold up
Boarding hope up like a foreclosed store front
They dug my soul up and never covered the hole up
You know what?

[Hook x2]
Bang, bang, Boogie say up jump the boogie, to the rhythm
Of the boogie, Come on, gotta look at me
Don’t ignore me, keep me alive
Support me, let me survive

Bang, bang, Boogie say up jump the boogie, to the rhythm
Of the boogie, Come on, gotta look at me
Don’t ignore me, keep me alive
Support me, let me survive
