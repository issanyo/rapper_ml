[Intro: Brother Ali]
Said they just don't make 'em like this no more
In fact they never made 'em like this before
I'm 'bout the baddest man that ya eyes done saw
Baby, I'm down by law

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous

[Verse 1: Brother Ali]
Life gave me nothing free, but my ugly
Ass mug and a couple of fat nuts to squeeze
Dick dangling down in my dungarees
Hungry beast, I'll chase your ass up a tree
You know what's up with me, I'm sucker-free
Not uptown or uppity, it's not my cup of tea
Feared one in the streets, won't nothing bleed
Except my knuckle meat, caught up in your fucking teeth
Brother, please, I'm out here rhyming for survival
Plus I got a outta-body-mind-blowing live show
Squad of fine dimes follow me wherever I go
Got them on their knees trying to honor my arrival
Quick Draw McGraw, this mic of mine
I'm a prime time pridaw, down by lidaw
Broke dick, big dog. Who the hell am I?
The A, the L, the I, and I'm the God damn shit, y'all

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
You should see me swing the jimmy

[Verse 2: R.A. The Rugged Man]
Don't get me started, I'm golden era, '88 baby highly regarded
I get stupid, dookie, doo-doo, def, dumb, retarded
Watch you fade like a high top when I drop, leave you flattened like a
Pancake at IHOP, with a pistol I'm a nice shot
Many battles are losable, losing isn't unusual
Life is brutal, but beautiful, birth allude to a funeral
I'm straight raw, cocaine natural, you that flesh-eating
Veterinarian drug used to de-worm cattle
The same way Big flipped mics I'mma show you how I run things
I'm the Don: Corleone, Cornelius, Trump, King
Is the world yours or mine? I'm an immortal in his prime, structure doesn't
Follow the corporate design, I'm snapping your porcelain spine
Too deep for the mortal mind every time I'm recording a rhyme
They find that I'm crossing the line if you're blind and ignoring the grind
It's sickening, ain't a chick alive I won't stick my dick in
I'm more shameless than Hammer dancing for popcorn chicken
Ace was the ink before Irv Gotti was laundering loot
And he dropped Slaughtahouse before they was ever forming a group
Fuck being miserable, whether it's the mental or in the flesh physical
Blessed are the poor in spirit, yeah, I took it Biblical, I'm so
Dangerous

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
You should see me swing the jimmy

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
When this mic's in my hand I'm a cannibal man
Eat my own kind, damn, I'm an animal, fam
And if you a grown man then stand if you can
On your own two feet with a tangible plan
Now my plan's ripping them all, never fall
And achieve all goals like I'm kicking a ball
Like taking out your dick in the mall, want everyone
To see that it's me and I'm sicker than y'all
And this track's like a brick in the jaw, a bat to the head
Go ahead, get back in the bed
Keep sleeping, I'll be the nightmare of your dreams
Spit right, the flow's tight like a pair of your jeans
Take those off, y'all dudes feminine style
So foul, meanwhile, men, women, and child
Praise me, the epitome of the best
Deadly like three in the chest, dangerous

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
You should see me swing the jimmy
