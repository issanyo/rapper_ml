[Hook] {x2}
"The world is in an uproar yeah
Countries all they just talking about is just war
[?] is falling yeah
I don't think, I don't think that passion is going down anymore"

[Verse One: Brother Ali]
Have mercy on me my Lord
I'm just trying to walk to the corner store
And the brown and blue armies are always at war
What on Earth they wanna harm me for?
Shit, dog eat dog, wings clipped it's hard for me to soar
Keep falling to the concrete floor
That's nothing, I done swam with sharks before
My heart's seen more than you could possible store
I would never think of starting for the door
Till the stars can't burn no more
And then when I'm gone in my glory and laid to waste
No one's ever going to take my place
Wouldn't cover nothing ugly, just to save face
I don't sugar coat the way shit taste
That's my saving grace
There's nothing I would rather be
Then just good god damn Ali
Believe you me
Peace
