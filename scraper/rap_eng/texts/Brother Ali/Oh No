[Verse One: Brother Ali]
Well alright, alright
Battle raps cause I've shaken grown men
To the point where they can't even face they own friends
That's why they rhyme about jewels not life
Cause the ice on which they skating on is so thin
That's what I love about the human soul
It will usually show when the truth ain't told
Ha, you'se a liar I can smell it on you
Got the voice down pat but your eyes are telling on you
Shame on you
For stretching your mouth around shit that your heart knows you don't do
No one taught you, this shining is damn near impossible
When you're at odds with the god in you
To the contrary, earthly flesh become hostile
And every single molecule is mocking you
I've been spit through the bowels of this bitch
What the fuck do I got to prove except this

[Hook]
"Oh no"

[Verse Three: Brother Ali]
Listen
Never once in all my born days have I ever felt quite exactly this way
Like rocks might break underneath the slight weight
Of a fraction of what it is that I've got to say
I work hard and sweat excellence
Firmly believing that God steps ahead of us
Knew I never forgot what the question is
Exodus with a heart full of messages
Sometimes they not polished at all
And a fella might spit 'em with a lot of little flaws
But never meant to injure sometimes I might offend ya
But there's just one thing I can promise to y'all
I sweep Hell and burn the broom
And serve firewater to the cursed and doomed
With a solid gold serving spoon
Before anyone could ever say my verse ain't the truth
Shit

[Hook]
