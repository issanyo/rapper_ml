[Brother Ali]
Let's even it up
Your blood for our blood
Feed 'em from what we been eatin'
Make em taste sour love
They speak a funny tongue-
Only understand the language of money and guns
And they only left us one
So we gon' holla at ya
Chop it up and parlay with ya
Watch the god complex whither when the hollows hit ya
May your blood clean the streets where you killed our future
And shot Yatusa[?]
Lest you give body to Lucifer
Cold walkin' zombie with bullets for eyes
It's not just a disguise
They bitter killers inside the
Human fingers of the slave trade legacy
Vampire overseer incarnate ugly like the Mona Lisa
If you livin' in the fringe
The mere image is enough to make you quiver in your skin 'cause
They have no consequences, they have no fear
Put one behind one's ear, do one every year
Drop a bowling ball through the roof of a squad car
Hang 'em from a light pole as proof that they are not hard
This is the anger that you created by strangling a man in the middle of the streets with his hands up
Picture on a closed casket where the phony flag sits
Let 'em never take black tape off of they badges
The slave's last task is digging graves for their masters
Plant 'em in the field where they prayed for disaster

[Chorus]
Officer Down
Let off a round in the sky
'til the fire in his eye
Burns brown

We can't wait 'til we hear you say
Going down, may day may day
We're gonna drown

Officer Down
Let off a round in the sky
'til the fire in his eye
Burns brown

We can't wait 'til we hear you say
Going down, may day may day
We're gonna drown

[I Self Devine]
Let's get started
Stupid, retarded
Aimin' at targets
Blastin' with purpose
Workin' with burners
Hood service
Community outlets
Out with the mindset
That we can't police ourself
'cause we savages
We don't need you
You create the problems we can see through
Money operations
See you stop an' wait
And pop pop a Glock
Non stop up inside a station
While we was springing my mind
Steady evaluatin'
Reflectin' and plannin'
For understandin'
What was I born on this planet to cause havoc?
In every life on the Earth I been an underdog
Reppin' with field nigga
Ex-slave with real people
One for [?] and two for Courtney Williams
[?]
Workin' with pigs it won't help and
There's no good pigs on the force
I'm Islam, you Swine
Unless you cross that Blue Line
We got terrorists with blue steel
Exercise the free will to kill
But still it gets really real
From slave catchers to serpents that serve murder
A pig slaughtered to me
Is like a dropped burglar
The media pumps his wife and his kids
And we get blasted, it's like we did a bid
So get ready as we ride 'til we die
It's some serious as tears start to fly

[Chorus]
Officer Down
Let off a round in the sky
'til the fire in his eye
Burns brown

We can't wait 'til we hear you say
Going down, may day may day
We're gonna drown

Officer Down
Let off a round in the sky
'til the fire in his eye
Burns brown

We can't wait 'til we hear you say
Going down, may day may day
We're gonna drown
