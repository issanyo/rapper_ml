[Intro]
(The first thing I want to say is)

[Verse 1]
I came in the door nineteen eighty four
Paint on the wall got chased by the law
Once got stole in the face for the flow
Was never given a zone had to create my own
It's plain as the nose on my face that I place to the stone
Had to stake my claim to the throne
Ain't no mistaken the sacred in his tone
Ali the new name by which greatness is known
Ya'll act like emceeing is a new sport
You're too inexperienced, your teeth are too short
Every culture has a right to passage
You wanna bypass it and sell me your practice
One for the lunch money
I dont run from you punch-drunk dummies I invite ya'll to come for me
I set up shop hungry when it wasn't sunny
I'll be here long after ya'll are done humpin'
Talk to me when you've done something
Other than swing back n' forth from hating to nut hugging
Know all criticism isn't constructive
Some need to be destructed your done with
And either you retire to the sidelines
Or imbrace this timeless grind with your eyes wide open
Cause you gonna have to earn them accolades
A-N-T gon take you all back to phase one

[Hook 1]
Yes Yes ya'll you dont stop
Now come alive A-N-T and give me what you got
Brother Ali rock shock the house we most definitely
We bout to turn shit out ya'll
A yes yes ya'll and you dont dare stop
Well come alive A-N-T and give me what you got
Brother Ali rock shocking the house we most definitely
(The way I feel now I just got to rock)

[Verse 2]
Ya'll ain't heard nothing I gave you your first lesson
For what you're discussin' over the percussion
You'll never compare to me you a parrot parody
Repeating what you hear fly through the airwaves carelessly
The meaning gets lost in translation
You're a copy of the authors first page
Counterfeit money, only get it in small denominations
You'll never be prominent - face it you're imitation
Equal, saccharin, cheap ass generic aspirin
Fructose corn syrup similac and shit
We used to distribute our music ourselves
Our records shouldn't even be held on the same shelve
Its bad enough they put ya'll with rock the bells
Cliche' the culture we're blessed to be involved in it
Ya'll are sqaundering it don't even think for a minute bout pushing limits
You just see a pond to fish in
And you will get strangled by your lines
Whether your angling or saying ryhmes in due time
Send your dudes back to shoe shines and clipping coupons
Fuck you and fuck the lighter you open your brew on
You slither out from under a rock
And then present yourself for something you not the brother you jock
Tried true hip hop customs forgot
I'm swinging on the first biting mother fucker I spot
Why the fuck not I would love nothing more than to bust your body blood clot
Spot
Three things I got I love'em alot
And do anything to protect them from the vultures that plot
Hover above em' and flock
You mother fuckers better not

[Hook 2]
Yes Yes ya'll you dont dare stop
Now come alive A-N-T and give me what you got!
Brother Ali rock shock the house
Most definitely we gon turn shit out ya'll
Yes yes ya'll and you dont dare stop
Well come alive A-N-T and give me what you got!
Brother Ali rock shock the house
Most definitely we bout turn shit out ya'll

[Verse 3]
The champion is back with his man again
Crack the book open and fill another chapter in
And we just won't stop
Come alive Rhymesayer give me whatcha got
