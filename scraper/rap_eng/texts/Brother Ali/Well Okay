[Verse 1]
Drowning in some kind of rut, grinding, trying to find a buck
Time was up, was out of luck, I was kinda stuck
Eyes wide swollen shut, it's when you're lucky enough
To duck a sucker punch, slip up and catch a upper cut
Crack heads, junkies, and drunks, mugger first
Glad I'm up, come to run 'em up 'till the sun come up
Kids don't run or jump, Hopscotch Double Dutch
Corners of they mouth down, frowning, here come the bust
My head is always up, I was told as such
Cry forever and a day it won't be long enough
Had to get my timing up, refine, shine it up
Gotta find a diamond in the rough, mine's I can strut
A rails solid up, I can bust, destruct
Better get it right, 'fore the pipes decide to bust
But the sun keep shining, the Earth keep turning
And the beats keep banging away, so okay
Married as a seventeen year old
Nobody had the guts to tell me "you ain't even grown"
She ain't love me, she just didn't want to be alone
But I ain't love her, I just love feeling needed so
I guess we're even, yo, turn out she was silly, though
I'm talking messed up in the head like I ain't seen before
Argued every single day, she was screaming flow
Things around the crib with us that aren't leaving, ho
We had a kid, he wasn't even three months old
She would leave him home, alone, only God know how long she'd be gone
Didn't know where we would go, you're coming with daddy now
Happy now, leaving though we sleep on the floor
Here she go, blew her top, 'round my baby boy watch
She socked my in the eye, in the mosque
But the sun keep shining, the birds keep chirping
And the beats keep banging away, so okay
