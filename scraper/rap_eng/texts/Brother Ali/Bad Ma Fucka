I circle my opponents like a bird of prey, in search of a vertebrae
Just to curse your day, and make blue sky revert to gray
Trying to work my way back to where the purpose gave birth
To the perfect way to quench my thirst to slay rappers
Penetrate your fragile brain matter
Stand glaring at you with command, and frame, and stature
Actually mastered the talent it takes to seize the breath
Out of your chest and leave em shaking
These heads never impressed us, I credit the best cause I
?Mix every breath? with respect for my predecessors
To die the best of deaths is meaning gunfire
Blessed with faith alone, testing the oppressive
This dimension inside your pain is my domain
By signing my name I solidify the rain
In an instant I will drain em, get em out the game
Insisted upon bickering with death until the quiet came
In silence remained, touched him with his lights out and
I'm in his veins, ushering his life out him
He cried when it came, the moment he froze
And death pulled his soul through the hole in his nose

From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight
From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight

Let 'em watch the Brother rip, they need to fucking study it
Hella the missin pieces like they tryin' to make the puzzle fit
It's some other shit, nothing like when we discovered it
Fools rapping like they tried to suck a dick and bust they lip
Half assing and ain't mastered to crowd for shit
They pacifists and there ain't nothing bout them passionate
Never had a pay a bill, or spent a day in jail
And hold mic's like they're scared as hell to break a nail
Keep your behind inside your seat, eyes upon your feet
Need to keep riding the dick instead of tryin' to ride the beat
I come from a time when rhyming was true self defining
Ain't no time for whining, protecting your little hymen
If your crew's really the shit, prove it in your set
You really should get off the stage, you're too pretty to sweat
If he's not in alliance, beat him in to compliance
Something to do while I'm feeding him to the lions
Keep being defiant, ain't nothing I can say to you
Except you better stay out my range of view, a day or two
Your friendly neighborhood Rhymesayer, I'll lay a
Asswhoopin on ya, that's one of a kind, playa

From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight
From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight

You live in a world of artificial turf, plastic sky
Got the nerve to stay up nights and ask it why
?Ho's? fucking your shit up, you're forced to pucker your lips up
That gets flipped up, you can kiss your own ass goodbye
You don't understand me, I don't have Plan B
I don't have a Mom and Dad to help me land on my feet
I don't have the luxury of living where the grass is green
Ink pen victims and ten of their friends with them
Ive been kicking, scratching scraping for respect
Since knee-high, believe I will take it to your neck
I release my, venomous sentiments at the drop of a hat
You motherfuckers got a problem with that?
I step through all possible traps
Once you walk with your balls fully exposed it's hard to look back
And I gotta react, not for nothing, just to cuss you
There ain't nothing subtle 'bout an old fashioned "Fuck You"

From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight
From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight
