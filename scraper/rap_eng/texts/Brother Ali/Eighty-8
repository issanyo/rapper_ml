[Brother Ali]
I was raised on the hip-hop
More raised in more ways than one
This is back when hip-hop was still fun
When Public Enemy was still number one
Before all the pro-black cats discovered guns. (No funds!)
Countin’ money so me and my man skate
To Kool Moe Dee records Makin’ up hand-shakes
He’s a damn fake to say he can’t relate to Mike Tyson Punch-Out
Drinkin’ up the Kool-aid and getting’ cussed-out
Bust out in the evening, I’m free when I’m breathin’
Incense and got the EPMDin’
Back then an album was something you could listen to for 6 months straight
(Somebody slap me if that isn’t true)
When my religion was hip-hop, Chris dropped the testament
That to this day got me wanna be intelligent
We didn’t have Mumia back then
We had Mandela back then
I rock the green, black and yellow back then
When Foxy Brown was breakin' in her first training bra we had dreams
But Rosie Perez is who we saw
Never said that I was old school but let me get it straight
This game has never been as straight as it was in ‘88

[Interlude]

Doin’ my thang with an ’89 swing
Kick this one here for me and my king
’89 the number, another summer
One one one one
The mic the man, the master plan
And if you need ‘em I got crazy prophylactics
Had to climax when I max, relax and chill
Sit down eat your slice of pizza and be quiet
Buddy Buddy Buddy all in my face
The J to the A to the M to the E
I’m talented yes I’m gifted
Nigga please, you work for UPS
It’s not about a salary, it’s all about reality
And the J-U-N-G-L-E
I don’t slur my words when I rap ‘cuz that’s wack
Kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug than I jack
Crashhh!!! 2000 suckas!
