[Verse 1: MaLLy]
I’m hungry, I done had me hundreds of meals
Lick a shot for every day a spirit turned to the steal
Fuck a pill, you can say my life behind bars
Is hard being and cat trying to rumble with bears
I love it when they hands in the air just like a criminal
Guilty of digging you, wanna post show interview
Wow so many faces in the crowd
I'll be gone till November and it make my mom's smile
New towns I’m proud to look around
Handshakes, laugh loud and they say that we put it down
Virgins to the life, singing verses every night
On purpose, not a circus dawg, serpants and they bite
[?] a lighter and 'dro sense
I'm gone, coming home, this one is over the fence
Every prayer that I said this year came in handy
Offer me a drink on the road and we family


[Hook: Brother Ali] {x2}
"Come back home"
My home's away from home all the places I roam
You know we, "Coming home"
Any stage I'm on, tryna stay in my zone, you know I
"Come back home"

[Verse 2: Bambu]
I don't need to pack, I got a bag ready
I mean I've been already steady on the road heavy
So when you offer up your couch and say, "It's cool bro."
Hahaha
I might really come through bro
I’m so far from home I gotta sing these songs to keep [?]
I’m tryna see the people I am working for
Get you asking questions more like, "What's he angry for?"
They ain't shot boy with gun but he ain't holding one
That sound like murder but the law say...
As long as they got badge on their chest
And you black or you brown...Well, you know the rest
But you should tell your parents, set another plate
Cause in the morning I'll be driving to another state
But as long as they got cops who are assholes
I’mma feel like I'm back home
Lil looks I get it in magazines and blog sites
Now I'm reporting that I'm rocking of a stage right
Inshaa Allah I hope I make it through the night
To wake up and try preserve a Palestinian life

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Brother Ali]
From the moment I was on tour opening for Sean or
Sleeping on the hard floor, tryna make the crowd roar
As I recall it's been a decade now or more
A matter of fact, that’s how long I've known some of y'all for
I knew you when you were 19
Letters you used to write my team from that rehab tryna get clean
The pretty queen that you brought to all the shows
Till one day you took a knee in the front row and proposed
And you knew me when I was cursing at the sky
Hurt person just trying to find a purpose to survive
And you helped me to hit my stride
You put me inside that light
And you knew you had a hand in that
You watched it all with pride
Look at what you did for me
Freedom that you give to me
Let me be the [?] even when you disagree
I appreciate when you say that I'm underrated
But I like being a secret cause that's the way that God made it
If you're listening then you and I are related
And you know I take this very sacred
Till the day that I die I promise I'll always stay so true
Long as I got you to come home to
You know you

[Hook]
