[Verse One: MaLLy]
Good morning world
Turn the volume up
Are you locked in so others can't bother us?
The rectangle retard, I'm the only truth
What you wanna learn today? 20 ways to shoot
Or rich off white so you can start counting loot
Or how to lie in all of your raps when you hit the booth
The war on drugs, poverty, pause
And no you can't make it if you ain't dunking a ball
The price of education is high, use a loan
And grab my arm, no harm, you won't lose a home
I want to bleach your brain with fame quick
Take a pill for everything in life, you look sick
And I'm the biggest one out now in showbiz
I made self esteem, intelligence and [?]
You ugly, commercials will turn you back lovely
Everyday somebody turn me on they all love me

[Hook: MaLLy]
Lies and effect know it's not one love
See the world differently when the man is unplugged
Violence and greed make us spill our own blood
You can see a lot better when the man is unplugged

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey one love
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey unplugged


[Verse Two: MaLLy]
You could never be yourself without me
The reason why blacks wanna give their scalps weave a better look
Ayo, just keep staring at the picture
Why advertise water it doesn't ruin the liver?
Too bad you mad, believe I'm the new dad
Throw on some Axe and you can smell like a douche bag
Money is the goal, control on every soul
Buy it back after you sell it, you didn't know
Reality actors, pedophilia pastors
Stronger than a book or any biblical chapter
Fast food franchise fuckery
To help you lose weight right after you finish eating a 100 piece
Swear it's all good in the hood, now currently
President is black I'm showing you my diversity
Look into my eye, no lie I still see y'all
Don't think of any smart ideas or turn me off

[Hook]

[Bridge: Brother Ali] {x2}
How you gonna think outside the box when your eye is always on that box?

[Verse Three: Brother Ali]
Whisper to a scream nothing's ever unseen
Everything is beamed from a lens to a screen
24 hour news censoring the scene
The eloquent machine of a rhetoric regime
Every single room in your house, it got a wall
No matter how many you always want more
It never goes off, you can never ignore
And you'll never be alone with your thoughts anymore
The human ice age when our hearts unthaw
Engraved with images of torture and war
With uncut floor scenes never saw before
Dignity lost on a cutting room floor
No more actors, only puppet masters
All huddled up in a control room laughing
Reality shows with no reality shown
And they spawn characters out of all our asses
All wrong tactics
Everything is relative
How did we ever live without no electric sedative?
To set the precedence
Even the president will be right back after these special messages
