[Hook]:
Sirens will ring when the walls we have built come tumbling down
Ring the alarm
Sirens will ring when the walls we have built come tumbling down
Ring the alarm
Brick by brick we build the walls that limits our life
Aside with the ego we try to resist
Sirens will ring when the walls we have built come tumbling down
Tumbling down

[Brother Ali]:
Feels like my man Eligh's tapping me
Telling me to lighten the hell up actually
Can't get mad you see
That's what a friend should be
I guess I could approach it more happily
Huh, life is but a dream apparently
Might as well row my little boat more merrily
Things get bad but you can't get scared to breath
Gotta use your music as your therapy
Never expected what life handed me
Had to grab it and see exactly what's jammed in the sleeve
Didn't happen magically, you grow it gradually
Just stay adamant, that's the key
Drop a masterpiece, damn near annually
Fans addressing me as "your majesty"
And got family and they stand with me
Through all the tragedy and every calamity
And I'm just about as proud as a dad could be
It's like a victory lap for an athlete
So I guess I got a lot of audacity
To walk around here all sad and angry
Kind of way is that to act?
I went from broke down raggedy to sold out capacity
I should be thanking the Academy
Feels good Eligh, thanks for having me

Sirens will ring when the walls we've build come crumbling down
Ring the alarm
Sirens will ring when the walls we've build come crumbling down
Ring the alarm
Brick by brick we build the walls that limits our life
Aside with the ego we try to resist
Sirens will ring when the walls we've build come crumbling down
Tumbling down
