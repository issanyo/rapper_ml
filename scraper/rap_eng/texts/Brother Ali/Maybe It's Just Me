[Verse 1: Classified]
All I need's a flute beat and two sheets of loose leaf to move me
A two-piece on Toonie Tuesday and I'm groovy
Never needed much but papers and a few trees
To get the song flowin' like the blue sea
Yeah I smoke doobies with groupies
Who's breath smelled like blue cheese or sushi
Jeez, give me a few feet please
I could have these floozies naked like a nude beach
And I don't need to slip 'em any roofies
Shit is too easy
Huh, I ain't into cougars
Judge Judy
I'm truly unique
Too young to love Lucy
Raised on the Goonies and Bruce Lee movies
My defense is excellent
No one's gettin' to me
I'm callin' the shots
QB like Doug Flutie
I'm reckless, unruly, respect this you newbie
From the East coast
Reppin' Scotians and Newfies
I keep it fresh like the ocean and cool breeze

[Hook: Brother Ali]
Maybe it's just me
I keep, movin' this pen like it'll set me free
Best believe, I'm a flow on endlessly, let it be
I feel the love every breath I breathe, yes indeed
Give it to 'em, show you it's hot
Watch ya blow up, block up your box
Wait-Wait-Wait to hear a slammin track
By popular demand, I'm back

[Verse 2: Classified]
Uh, now every shirt that's in my closet got vomit
Chocolate and baby food on it and none of it comes out when I wash it
So now you think I give a damn what I'm rockin'
I don't wear the Cincinnati hat cause I watch 'em
You don't need to worry what I do, what I think
When your girl gets a round like she just bought us drinks
You got your own problems, back to the basics
There's no touchin' me like I just ejaculated
Nope, I don't say no homo
I don't need to reinsure myself like I crashed up the Volvo
I only like pussy
Sorry to be blunt but I got to make it clear
When my tongue is in your... ear, ya hear
I lock it down like Shawshank
I love writin' rhymes but hate when I draw blanks
I feel like I'm repeatin' myself, I'm overworked
And about to go berserk if I don't get this off my shoulders first
I thought I ought to tell you, better get warned
Th-Th-There's no need for alarmin'
Cause right now
On the microphone
The elements are airborne
I smell the success
Get busy on 'em
And my word is bond
There's-th-there's no need for alarm
Cause right now
On the microphone
What you need to do is smell the success

[Verse 3: Brother Ali]
You know me, I'm a 70s baby, yet 80s boy
I never had no love for the swings or playin' with toys
I was on the mic doin' my thing, just makin' some noise
I don't need to read no magazine, I'm straight from the source
You know I always had a dream, one day I'd step on
Stage and the ladies all scream like David Lee Roth
Teenager in the 90s
Things are changin' all around me
You can hate me if you want but I escaped
You got to find me
Hit the Minneapol'
I had my whole city baffled
Soon as they see you advancin'
Then they all want to attack you
Rhymesayers massive
We built us a little castle
Eyedea won every battle
We should've built him a statue
Every single week we slayed, anywhere we seen a stage
Even with the weak DJ, we rapped over every beat they played
Chewin' 'em up, spittin' 'em out
You never seen nobody this devout
We just want to spit and shout
They literally would kick us out
The spot, two o'clock when they closed doors
We took it to the block, ears throbbin', our throats sore
Hit the bus stop because we still got to flow more
Frozen cold blocks, swear to God we were so raw, oh Lord

[Hook]
