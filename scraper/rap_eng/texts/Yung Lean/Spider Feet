[Intro: Yung Lean]
Suicideyear
Ain't no squad ain't no boys man it's Sadboys in this bitch
L-Lean

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Spiders on my feet but you get caught up in the web
I was never playin' I was rockin' in the bed
I ain't got no baby Billy Jean my diamonds red
Chillin' off a benzo when I'm clearin' out my head
Spiders on my feet but you get caught up in the web
I was never playin' I was rockin' in the bed
I ain't got no baby Billy Jean my diamonds red
Chillin' off a benzo when I'm clearin' out my head

[Verse: Yung Lean]
All tainted Chevy painted heavy clear the windows out
All silver everything, my mind is hard to figure out
Playoff like the Lakers money make around and get her out
Page it, get it later, leave you quiet just like a mouse
Never had to fake it out just break the bread and spread it out
Yeah I keep the bread homie on me or not to leave my route
Never had to fake it out just break the bread and spread it out
Yeah I keep the bread homie on me or not to leave my route
I don't melt for nobody but her
Ridicule my situation, ridicule your words
Livin' with my symptoms like livin' with a bird
Ten toes down I keep countin' like a nerd
Geeked out but I'm down now I'm happy, seen the worst
Yeah I love life but I've lost for another
Yeah I love girls and I stay around my brothers
Pay myself with boss, it makes no difference towards others
Show me around and I'll show you all my fears
Take me to a town where they never see my tears
Put in time, but he forgot those years
Sorry I been caught up, but for you I'm always here
All tainted Chevy painted heavy clear the windows out
All silver everything, my mind is hard to figure out
Playoff like the Lakers money make around and get her out
Page it, get it later, leave you quiet just like a mouse
Never had to fake it out just break the bread and spread it out
Yeah I keep the bread homie on me or not to leave my route
Never had to fake it out just break the bread and spread it out
Yeah I keep the bread homie on me or not to leave my route
Playoff like the Lakers money make around and get her out
Page it, get it later, leave you quiet just like a mouse
Never had to fake it out just break the bread and spread it out
Yeah I keep the bread homie on me or not to leave my route
