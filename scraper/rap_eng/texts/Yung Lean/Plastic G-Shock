[Hook:]
Sad Boys be the set, catch me in a jet
Getting head with a mermaid on deck
Sad Boys be the set, catch me in a jet
Getting head with a mermaid on deck
I got the Casio, she got the G-Shock
We on the same watch, we on the same watch
Wheels on my Bentley keep turning
Wheels of justice keeps turning (turning)

[Verse 1:]
I pull up in a Chevy, chain be super heavy
Chopper to my head, blow, blow, I think I'm ready
Come through in the castle bitch, I'm King Koopa sneakin' 'round
Like an insect small hairless, looper bust off with this sniper store
Storm in like a stormtrooper, check the front, like it's snooper
Made a lot of mixtapes brain fell forward, like a TV blooper

Sad Boys be the set, catch me in a jet
Getting head with a mermaid on deck
Sad Boys be the set, catch me in a jet
Getting head with a mermaid on deck

We on the same watch, we on the same watch
Wheels on my Bentley keep turning
Wheels of justice keeps turning (turning)

[Verse 2:]
And I can't walk back, fuck and we all that, fuck and we all that, uh
Posted up in the airport, big Jet, with a couple midgets
Sip lean off the triple head, that bed head slept to deshed
I make plenty of bread sewed stacks, and plenty of racks
Caked up, cuz I'm finna mack, I'm in a cab, swerving on this acid
Looney Tunes tab gooey newsman, Louis Shoes-man
World's turning and I grew up too fast, posted in the street
Holler at cha boy, posted red Gucci on my feet
Holler at cha boy, aquarium three headed fish on the beat
Holler at cha boy, holler at your boy, swagger on my asshole

[Outro:]

Sad Boys, Yung Sherman, Yung Gud
Shawty Yung Lean Doer
What you up to tonight?, we posted up in Tokyo
