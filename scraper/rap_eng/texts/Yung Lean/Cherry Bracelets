[Intro: Yung Lean]
Uh uh uh uh uh
And you know how it go
And you know what it do
Lean

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
Blow in my nose and I'm riding in a coupe
Got my shawty with me so you know what it do
Cherry coloured bracelets and I'm making money moves
If you fuck with Lean, I punch your face and make it new

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Evil pumpkins in my yard, pouring, give me two
Roller blade stacks I got 100’s on me, blue
I got molly, I got weed, I got perky’s too
Riding in a Maserati high, acting a fool
I'ma hit the mall spend it all, Fendi shoes
Light blue sattelites fresh like I left school
I got everything you need, I got the magic tool
I got everything you need, I got the magic tool

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
Blow in my nose and I'm riding in a coupe
Got my shawty with me so you know what it do
Cherry coloured bracelets and I'm making money moves
If you fuck with Lean, I punch your face and make it new
Blow in my nose and I'm riding in a coupe
Got my shawty with me so you know what it do
Cherry coloured bracelets and I'm making money moves
If you fuck with Lean, I punch your face and make it new

[Verse 2: ECCO2K]
Think I need a boost, Thaiboy what’s the move?
Bladee told me come through, I'm like okay cool
Threw away my old shoes, I need something new
Now they acting cute, I'm not in the mood
Smoking on a gluestick, sticky, taste like fruit
I put on a suit, look like Heidi Klum
Memories turn blue, okay cool
In a Subaru, cut the roof
Doing NO2, yeah darling, I'm so cute
I got bloody jewels, you know what I'll do to you

[Verse 3: Bladee]
I'ma stay with her cause she’s special
What’s on my chain? It’s heavy metal
Triple six my wrist like I'm the devil
SBE, DG, stay together
If I want you girl, I want it forever
Get on my level, Margiela leather
Gucci bezels, shining like a treasure
Raw, Smackdown, feeling like a wrestler
Rolls fatter, count it like I'm Dracula
Future blacker, but I climb the ladder
Got the pack and it's busting out the wrapper
I'm on point with it like a dagger

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
Blow in my nose and I'm riding in a coupe
Got my shawty with me so you know what it do
Cherry coloured bracelets and I'm making money moves
If you fuck with Lean, I punch your face and make it new
Blow in my nose and I'm riding in a coupe
Got my shawty with me so you know what it do
Cherry coloured bracelets and I'm making money moves
If you fuck with Lean, I punch your face and make it new
