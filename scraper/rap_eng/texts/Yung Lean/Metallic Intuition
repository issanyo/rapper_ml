[Verse 1]
43XL on my baggy tee
Freddy G and scars on my shoulders see
Wannabe, they all look like some wannabes
I'mma leave every leaf that grows after me
Come and see, bitch, we deep, human centipede
On my feet, there's no e's, see no enemies
Kilo green, speak my heart till I rest in peace
All I see, road warriors, eternal sleep
I'ma leave everything for my family
Gotta go hard for myself, I look after me
20 e's, double g, never fall asleep
Eyes on sight, ancient whispers they still follow me

[Hook]
My ride ain't got no ceiling
My teeth ain't got no fillings
My wallet stuffed with dead people, ain't no livin
My eyes ain't got no feelings
My grandma said she feel me (she do!)
Ghosts in the street, still alive but not livin'
I'm tryna stack a milli, chain on stupid silly (chain)
Feel like Elvis Presley, Lean just left the buildin'
My boys right here with me, mystery still in it
Never switch up, got metallic intuition
My ride ain't got no ceiling
My teeth ain't got no fillings
My wallet stuffed with dead people, ain't no livin'
My eyes ain't got no feelings
My grandma said she feel me (she do!)
Ghosts in the street still alive but not livin
I'm tryna stack a milli, chain on stupid silly (bling, blaow)
Feel like Elvis Presley, Lean just left the buildin'
My boys right here with me, mystery still innit
Never switch up, got metallic intuition

[Verse 2]
Never switch up, you just mind your business
I'mma find you where I found my chemist
Slide to the back, then I ride my Bentley
Percocet at time blow 'em up like Kenny
Passions all on wine, my cup half empty
Tryin' to rewind, but I slip myself in (leandoer)
The world down with me, I snuck myself in
Tryin' to rewind but I slip myself in
40 in the building, chains in the ceiling
I don't really care, got metallic intuition
Give a fuck about the system
Narnia gave me wisdom
Keys to my mind, angels are my rhythm
Riding past, solo on an avenue
Grapes of wrath
No one ever told me what to do
I'mma spaz, damage, yeah, I'm damaged, dude
She my half, ballerina so Iâ€™ll fill the room

[Bridge]
My teeth ain't got no fillings
My ride ain't got no ceiling
My wallet stuffed with dead people
My teeth ain't got no fillings
My ride ain't got no ceiling
My wallet stuffed with dead people

[Outro]
Lean
All the way from Narnia is back man
Leandoer, man
Gud, me and Sherman, all of that, Sadboys to infinity
World ain't got no feelings but my [?] from my ceiling
My ride ain't got no ceiling, you know how this shit goes
Shout out my grandma, shout out my family, shout out 43XL
