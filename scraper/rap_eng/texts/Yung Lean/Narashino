[Verse: Yung Lean]
Yeeeah
I'm busy, young boss, shawty and young hoe, yeah
Shawty, you don't know, every time I sit next to you in class (in class)
I get an erection it's so freaking fast (Lean, Lean, Lean, Leandoer in this bitch, woo!)
I think you're stupid, but I really like you (Lean, Lean, paw-paw-paw!)
I think I could really wife you
Saw you outside McDonald’s at night
Your brown hair was reflected by the light
Lean thought's that you smoke a joint with my friends
I never went up to you in the end
You're always first and I'm always last
My mind runs around in circles
And always get stuck on your ass
I’m contemplating masturbating to pictures of you
And my mom would make it
Would even choke out a dudes
[?] one chance
Make and stay in it
You would take my hand and stick it down your pants
Nothing puff 'em [?] to take reach out
How we'll pass it?
I bet that you'd be a great mother, [?]
Only axes in my head
And we've fucking to masturbate to you in my bed

[Outro: Yung Lean]
Damn straight shawty
Damn straight shawty
