[Hook: Yung Lean]
Workin' on myself, by myself, for myself
I don't need your help, prefer my boys over wealth
I'm a sinner, fuck heaven, I'm in hell
Fuck one plus twelve, rather dead than in jail
Workin' on myself, by myself, for myself
I don't need your help, prefer my boys over wealth
I'm a sinner, fuck heaven, I'm in hell
Fuck one plus twelve, rather dead than in jail
Workin' on myself, by myself, for myself
I don't need your help, prefer my boys over wealth
I'm a sinner, fuck heaven, I'm in hell
Fuck one plus twelve, rather dead than in jail
Workin' on myself, by myself, for myself
I don't need your help, prefer my boys over wealth
I'm a sinner, fuck heaven, I'm in hell
Fuck one plus twelve, rather dead than in jail

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
I'm in this strip club off of drugs
Sixty blunts, dead eyes
Silver flux, bitches get head ties
Hair fly around like Linda Blair, I'm in bed now
In the sun I trust, getting money is a must, not a lust
My idea of heaven is a place on earth
Smokin' herb, getting hurt
Fuck the law, I'm a bird
I'ma swerve, lookin' sinister
Have you heard Leandoer, I'm absurd
She said she only pop ecstasy when she with me
She only do drugs when she fuck with Lean
I'm on my walkie talkie, all I see is dead trees
I be living in the world but I'm stuck in my fantasies
BMW m6 crawl, you know I gotta ball
Bitches call, I take it all, I get it large
I got nothing in my chest, insert a heart
I can't sleep, rest in peace to my dreams
L-Lean

Fuck one plus twelve, rather dead than in jail
Workin' on myself, by myself, for myself
I don't need your help, prefer my boys over wealth
I'm a sinner, fuck heaven, I'm in hell
Fuck one plus twelve, rather dead than in jail

[Verse 2: iLoveMakonnen]
Hit the town with your girl, bitches know I'm here
Mad Decent bomber jacket and some Asspizza Timbs
Smokin' on the best dro, when I'm off in the States
Taking off overseas, I don't fuck with no fakes
I keep my snowflakes, all my white be so bright
I keep the best green when I'm out here in flight
Kill it on every scene, Sadboys, what it do?
Young nigga out here flying with that red juggin' crew

Workin' on myself, by myself, for myself
I don't need your help, prefer my boys over wealth
I'm a sinner, fuck heaven, I'm in hell
Fuck one plus twelve, rather dead than in jail
