[Intro - Yung Lean]
Hurt me, you can never hurt me
Hurt me, you can never hurt me
Hurt me, you can never hurt me
Hurt me, you can never hurt me
Leandoer

[Hook - Yung Lean]
Cool wind over my face, I need peace
Cool city, crystal living, I can't leave
Diamonds dancing on ice, look just like Bambi
I'm a vampire, you can never hurt me
Cool wind over my face, I need peace
Cool city, crystal living, I can't leave
Diamonds dancing on ice, look just like Bambi
I'm a vampire, you can never hurt me

[Verse 1 - Yung Lean]
Fucking these bitches, I'm out of control
Walkin' the bank and got coke on my clothes
Robitussin on me, when I'm fuckin' a hoe
Trippin' on flo's, sap of them both
Got one Xanax, and three to go
Bitch, that's how it goes
Bitch, I'm a ghost
Like Bruce Willis, I am a ghost
(Hit it from the back, then I have to go)
Coppin' these Rolls, euros my nose
Live up the road, fuck what you know
I just broke up with my girlfriend, now I am back on the go
Gotta stack these stacks, when I'm fuckin' her slow
I'm single tonight, tell all your friends
So I got bitch hoes
Bitch, I'm a ghost
Bitch, I'm a ghost
Leandoer!

[Hook - Yung Lean]
Cool wind over my face, I need peace
Cool city, crystal living, I can't leave
Diamonds dancing on ice, look just like Bambi
I'm a vampire, you can never hurt me
Cool wind over my face, I need peace
Cool city, crystal living, I can't leave
Diamonds dancing on ice, look just like Bambi
I'm a vampire, you can never hurt me

[Verse 2 - A$AP Ferg]
Sad Boys, A$AP Mob, we're up in this bitch
Young Trap Lord on the block
Fuck with it, get money, I got a lot
All of my niggas is real
All of my niggas is trill
And dammit I'm taking the wheel
Leany is gone off a pill
All these diamonds on me dancin'
On ice like I'm Bambi
Pool party at the mansion
Trophy bitches fuck a Grammy
Sittin' pretty in a Bentley
Rest In Peace, my nigga Yammy
(Rest In Peace, my nigga Yammy)
(Rest In Peace, my nigga Yammy)

[Verse 3 - Yung Lean & A$AP Ferg]
In Miami yellow earrings, Ferg just got a new pair in
Rare garments  my appearance, word to my momma Sharon
Smoking dope, I'm rolling loud, I'll be in the crowd
Diamonds dancing on me now, even when I smile

[Bridge - Yung Lean]
Cool wind over my face, I need peace
Cool city, crystal living, I can't leave
Diamonds dancing on ice, look just like Bambi
I'm a vampire, you can never hurt me

[Hook - Yung Lean]
Cool wind over my face, I need peace
Cool city, crystal living, I can't leave
Diamonds dancing on ice, look just like Bambi
I'm a vampire, you can never hurt me
Cool wind over my face, I need peace
Cool city, crystal living, I can't leave
Diamonds dancing on ice, look just like Bambi
I'm a vampire, you can never hurt me

[Outro - Yung Lean]
Hurt me, you can never hurt me
Hurt me, you can never hurt me
Hurt me, you can never hurt me
Hurt me, you can never hurt me
