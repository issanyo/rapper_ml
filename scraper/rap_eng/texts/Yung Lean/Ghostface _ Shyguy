[Intro]
Lean
Leandoer (Leandoer in this bitch)

[Verse 1]
I got so much shit up on the stove, it gotta go, I need a boat
Money high, my power low, my heart during coke, can't let you go
Don't need this shit, don't need these shows
I'm on a roll, leave earth, need more
So much shit up on the stove
Show up in chrome, I leave in gold
Don't need to sell my fucking soul, the devil in me, already know
I do this for my kin, my folks, my bitch, my bros, might buy my soul
You know that I gotta know
Do you love me? Can't let me go
My cousin pouring Listerine up on the stove, got Louis toes

[Verse 2]
Burglar bars around the car
Frankenstein boys in my yard
Champagne bloody, fast go-karts
All my boys, they go too hard
Shadow streets, no signs of life
Sounds like Rome, straight from dome
I go hard, yeah, you go home
We not the same, braces filled with stone
Sunny, wear it out
Purp, dirty sprite
You know what, Leandoer, bitches all about
I got bitches and ice, yeah they think I'm nice
I don't really feel it, hang with snakes that eatin' mice
(Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
I pour a stripper and get dirty, dirty
We from the north, yeah we get flirty, flirty
Ay, we got some demons in this birdie, birdie
Ay, I fly like an eagle, not no birdie, birdie
