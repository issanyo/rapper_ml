[Intro]
Man oh man, you should see all the kinds of friends we've got over here at Foster's

[Chorus]
Crash Bandicoot bands my hands
Trash sandyroad skrrt the land
Crash Bandicoot bands my hands
Trash sandyroad skrrt the land
Crash Bandicoot bands my hands
Trash sandyroad skrrt the land
Crash Bandicoot bands my hands
Trash sandyroad skrrt the land

[Verse 1]
Black antidote I'm on ten
I'm in the parking lot where's my man
I'm off a xan off a juice off a bean
Trapped in our ways ain't nobody live free
Like Sherlock Holmes I sneak up on ya easee
I don't like trouble but it sure likes me
In a French garden on rocks fell asleep
Moon by my head and the sun at my feet
I tried to paint but I got a disease
You and me together could be something free
Got a lot of money but ain't shit free
Suckers everywhere but bitch I'm suckafree
Serpentine serpentine snakes out in Columbine
Four cups two cups I'm swerving outta mind
3 girls two nights I'm seeing stars tonight
Been in this shit so long I feel traumatized

[Break]
My whip bipolar and my flow schizophrenic
Diagnosed bipolar but I made it through the Atlantic
My whip bipolar and my flow schizophrenic
Diagnosed bipolar but I made it through the Atlantic
Get across the damn Atlantic
You wanna shake my hand bitch
I got all this money
Bet that you don't understand it

[Verse 2]
Drop top Cadillac
Cop drop samurai
I'm sipping lean mixed with bubbly
Poloâ€™d down lean but I don't play no rugby
Don't play no games with me cause I play ugly
My team medieval, our helmets rusty
Helmut Lang, Issey Miyake it must be
Can't take you seriously now you look suspect
I wanna fuck your bones out 'till you love me
Connection been going down lately, it's nothing
Don't know who to call today
It's summer so I'm chilling straight
On my porch sipping lemonade
Got coke and whiskey hibernate
Snakes in desert in my face
Shotgun and a issey case
Miyake and Yohji on my pants and diamonds in my face
Don't know who to call today
It's summer so I'm chilling straight
On my porch sipping lemonade
Got Coke and whiskey hibernate
Snakes in desert in my face
Shotgun and a issey case
Miyake and Yohji on my pants and diamonds in my face

[Outro]
Leandoer
Foster
Blue music
And new blues
Summer time
