[Intro]
(swedish)
Ey, turn it up in my headphones
Turn the snare a little bit up
I can't hear the beat
Okay
(turn the snare up in my headphones)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Riding through the galaxy
Feng shui
Molecules bonded by THC
Riding through the galaxy
Feng shui
Feng shui
Caught red handed with a hand in the cookie jar
Yung Lean above average bars
Fucking blue bitches like I saw on Avatar
Most unlikely to catch me at a salads bar
Grab a jar
Betray them all
Like Jafar
LSD trip bitch I think I'm Babar
Put her body in my car
Wear nothing but lucha libre masks
Here to break flash and hand out fake cash(?)
Michelle Obama got a fat ass
I think about it every time I'm in maths class
Bubble bath
Hip chicks holding double flasks
Bubble glass filled with orange juice
Lean will lead to trouble fast
Troubled path
Double tap
Smuggle crack
Leandoer will slide off your head caps
Stuck in the middle
Middle class
Fiddle with my boarding pass
Diddle with your Mom, like I'm Tom Riddle
From another time
Do her from behind
Pre roasted oyster mango chutney in the toaster
Money clip to money fold
On the port I have a zero on the rollercoaster strike me up
Stuffed, roasted, greased chicken on a poster
Bacon and lettuce on a sandwich make it vanish
Get my hair cut by a Spanish
Catch a barber's itch
Sick shit, Yung Lean ain't got no glitch
Busting coppers like they bad bitch
Black magic evil wish
Cruel witch
Drink a glass of milk wash it down with a pill
Killing pussy without purpose like Cruella De Ville
Living my life like I'm Dr Phil
That pussy's finger licking
Kicking down your door while the clock is ticking
Plastic titty
Bricking THC up
