[Hook]
No fuckin' regrets
Live to die amongst the best
With grim reaper playin' chess
If you die, take me instead
No fuckin' regrets
Live to die amongst the best
With grim reaper playin' chess
If you die, take me instead

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
To die another day don't know if I'll be okay
Fuck 'em fuck 'em in the face, they doubt me, I let 'em fade
Fade like memories some day
2 chains on, got silver rings on, don't know who to call today
Thank god my squad gon' ball all day
Louis case, might cost all day
Fuck this life, I'm gone all day
You know all about me, but I don't know about you
I've been smokin' dope and buyin' it, think anythin', I try that shit
All my friends be gettin' rich and all I know is doin' this

[Hook: Yung Lean]
No fuckin' regrets
Live to die amongst the best
With grim reaper playin' chess
If you die, take me instead
No fuckin' regrets
Live to die amongst the best
With grim reaper playin' chess
If you die, take me instead

[Verse 2: Bladee]
I get used on, I get you a song
Wanted to be gone, but I'm holdin' on
20 minute song, told you we gon' come
Midnight lasts so long, when the smoke's gone
On the beach I'm gone, I got gucci lungs
Man this Xan is strong, I can give you one
I'm a ghost everybody knows
At the coast 'bout to overdose

[Hook]
No fuckin' regrets
Life to die amongst the best
With grim reaper playin' chess
If you die, take me instead
No fuckin' regrets
Life to die amongst the best
With grim reaper playin' chess
If you die, take me instead
No fuckin' regrets
Life to die amongst the best
With grim reaper playin' chess
If you die, take me instead
No fuckin' regrets
Life to die amongst the best
With grim reaper playin' chess
If you die, take me instead
No fuckin' regrets
Life to die amongst the best
With grim reaper playin' chess
If you die, take me instead
No fuckin' regrets
Life to die amongst the best
With grim reaper playin' chess
If you die, take me instead
