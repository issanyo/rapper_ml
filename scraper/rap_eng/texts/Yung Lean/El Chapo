[Hook: Ballout]
They wanna stuff me in the jet like El Chapo
They wanna kill me cause I'm gloing like El Capo
A hunnid blue grand, I count it up pronto
A hunnid bricks stuffed up in the Bronco

[Verse 1: Ballout]
If you wanna meet me, meet me at the Texaco
We call that lil spot, Lil fucking Mexico
We get the money, spend the money just to let you know
I'm all about my guap, I need my fucking pesos
I'm in the meeting, I'm in the meeting like the fucking case closed
I'm the boss nigga I ain't got no payroll
Blood on my Margielas, nigga fuck your booster
I'm Glo Gang bitch, I'm the fuckin' truth
When I was young as hell, I used to have a Boost Mobile
I was chirpin' servin, I thought I was too grown
I got locked up then I bond out
Back up on the block, now it's my time now

[Hook: Ballout]
They wanna stuff me in the jet like El Chapo
They wanna kill me cause I'm gloing like El Capo
A hunnid blue grand, I count it up pronto
A hunnid bricks stuffed up in the Bronco

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
I want a black Hummer, riding with my boys in space
Shout out my accountant, she got super duper taste
She love the money, count it up, real quick like a race
I don't drink no alcohol, so I don't make mistakes
My own private Idaho, I'm flying through gates
I was at the pearly gates, but it wasn't my time
Out in Kyoto, man I stayed on my grind
I wanted to love you for my whole fucking life
M-m-m-Margielas on me right now
So high that I can't get down
Spider on my arm, man I'm iced out with no lights out
I don't fall in love bitch, I'm balling in the club bitch
Sherm just bought 6 bottles so you know we don' give a fuck bitch

[Hook: Ballout]
They wanna stuff me in the jet like El Chapo
They wanna kill me cause I'm gloing like El Capo
A hunnid blue grand, I count it up pronto
A hunnid bricks stuffed up in the Bronco
