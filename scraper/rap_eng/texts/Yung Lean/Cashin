Shawty call

[Verse 1: Adamn Killa]
Bitch I'm out in Europe like I'm out here on vacation
But I'm doing shows touring across the nation
If you want it, gotta get it like it ain't no waitin'
Bitch I want it right now, I don't got no patience
Niggas be broke cos they got all the patience
Don't know the currency so I don't know what I'm paying
Bitch I'm Adamn, that is what I'm saying
All this foreign money I can't count what I'm making
There's me, Lean, whitearmor and we out here baby
I don't want no baby, killavesi is my baby
Bitch I'm Adamn, all the hot boys they like hating
I can't save no thot cos these bitches they got rabies

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
I be cashin
Shawty splashin
What you know about Lean, I'm getting stacks
I'm on the frozen throne I might just catch it
Angels falling in my soul, money stacking, gucci cologne
Got cash got bags my bros
Many men wanna kill me, I don't know
Why they trying to get me I just blow
Money and coke up in my nose
Percs in my system, I'm never slow
Golden noise running round the floor
I sit down in the frozen throne
She called me up and called me on the phone
She fucked me over once, someone that I know
I be getting dough
Soldiers from white snow
Moola in my rover
With Adamn killing my soul
Fuck with Lean I break your bones
Fuck with Lean I break your bones
Moola in my rover
