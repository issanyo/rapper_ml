[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Leandoer
Euros in my bank account
Got foreign diamonds on my plate
Swervin, all these bank accounts
Go jump on the wave, it's too late
Foreign foreign bitch I'm foreign
Let these fuckers know I'm up to date
Shawty wanna celebrate but
All my boys got stacks of cake
Picked up pepper on the streets, all white
Neon floating on the floor, jetski
Sadboys tattoo in Times New Roman
I let em know not to hold me, I let them know I'm the omen
Dont get pissed if you jack my style
Cause I know you're too slow man
Hannibal Lecter, ballin inspector
100 dollar bills, poppin pills, sippin nectar
100 million films on my TV projector
Leave the bodies in my jetski
Pick them up imma collector
Bitch Iâ€™m Harmony Korine
In my whole life I'm the director
And my team Sadboys get the check bruh
Don't forget to sign off, killed the rap game
Leave the body with the spine off
Lean, Lean, Leandoer

[Hook: Thaiboy Digital]
GTBSB in the building
Shawty wanna fuck
But you don't know how I be feelin
Rolex in my Rari
GTB that's army
Shawty I be ballin
Shawty I be ballin
GTB SB in the building
Shawty wanna fuck
But you don't know how I be feelin
Rolex in my Rari
GTB that's army
Shawty I be ballin
Shawty I be ballin

[Bridge: Thaiboy Digital]
Ballin, ballin, GTB that's army
Pullin up that Rari
Everything be foreign
Running with them Sadboys
Money we be pourin
That hoe, she be boring
Foreign we be tourin

[Verse 2: Bladee]
Robotic instincts got metallic dreams
Burberry tees, walking out, you and me
10 soda cans in if you wanna drink
Razor blade in my fist
You can get extinct
I got glue on my Ferragamo linen shirt
In my house but it's feelin like I'm in a church
Barbed wire on the fence you can't get inside
Got a wall full of knives if you wanna die
CDG tee shirt I got no heart
You see me, my shoes cost a gold bar
GTBSG shield gang boys
I was broke, I got paid
Then I soared up
