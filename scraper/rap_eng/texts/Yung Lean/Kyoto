[Chorus]
Do me, I'mma do me
I'mma make mine, I'mma make mine
I fuck the shine, I said fuck the shine
Bitch, I grind, bitch, I grind
Yung Lean swerving in, see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up, in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shallow

[Verse 1]
I got an empire of emotion
Squad see me crusin', crusin' in my go kart
I'm War hoe, I'm Warhol
I'm Wario when I'm in Mario Kart
Topping the charts, ace in my cards
Choppa my locka when I'm writing these bars
Koka Kola veins, I'm insane
Trip through memory lane
Out in Narashino  and I see my own white shadow
A tad too close, rad with a bad diagnose
Coke-filled nose, too weird for them other fuckboys
Catch Lean and Sad Boys
Out in Europe, sippin' cristal
I'm smoking loud with my lost boys
All this money don't make me sad though
Rubber bands in my pants bro
Don't close your eyes and lean back though
Ya'll ain't ready for the lean attack though
Lean, lean, lean, younging with my Team
Pumping RZA, eating pizza
Man I'm living my dreams, living my dreams (living in my dreams)
(Fucked your bitch in the...)

[Chorus]
Do me, I'mma do me
I'mma make mine, I'mma make mine
I fuck the shine, I said fuck the shine
Bitch, I grind, bitch, I grind
Yung Lean swerving in see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up, in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shallow
I'mma make mine, I'mma make mine
I fuck the shine, I said fuck the shine
Bitch, I grind, bitch, I grind
Yung Lean swerving in see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up, in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shallow

[Verse 2]
My life I've comprehended, it's not a lie
I'm dependent on my team
When I send it, I spit fire, I'm an element
I’m everything, you're irrelevant
Ta-take it easy, yeah we getting it
BBC pants yeah I’m getting rich
All this love I'm melting it
Don’t let me down I’m not meant for it
If you ask me, I might come for it
I'll take you back to the rain forest
My heart and soul, yeah you tore it
I don't want to be here, my life's more of it
There's more of it
S-A-D B-O-Y-S
See me in the club with it tatted on my chest
S-A-D B-O-Y-S
See me in the cut with it tatted on my chest
See me on the bus, blowing sesh
Nothing less, we the best, fuck the rest
Water in my lungs, finna quest, I won't hit the earth
Fire, water, dirt, too turnt, too burnt
Make mistakes, I guess I'll never learn
See, see, see that's my firm
Nike, Nike on my shirt
Bubbles bubbles, blowing bubbles
But I guess they'll never burst
Empire of my state of mind
I'mma do me, I'mma make it mine
I say fuck the shine, I say fuck the shine
Bitch I grind, bitch I grind, I'm hard to find

[Chorus]
Do me, I'mma do me
I'mma make mine, I'mma make mine
I fuck the shine, I said fuck the shine
Bitch, I grind, bitch, I grind
Yung Lean swerving in see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up, in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shallow
Do me, I'mma do me
I'mma make mine, I'mma make mine
I fuck the shine, I said fuck the shine
Bitch, I grind, bitch, I grind
Yung Lean swerving in see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up, in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shallow
Do me, I'mma do me
I'mma make mine, I'mma make mine
I fuck the shine, I said fuck the shine
Bitch, I grind, bitch, I grind
Yung Lean swerving in see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up, in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shallow
Do me, I'mma do me
I'mma make mine, I'mma make mine
I fuck the shine, I said fuck the shine
Bitch, I grind, bitch, I grind
Yung Lean swerving in see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up, in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shallow
