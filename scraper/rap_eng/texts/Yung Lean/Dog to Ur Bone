[Intro]
Ahhhh ehhhh
Ahhhh ehhhh
Ahhhh

[Verse 1]
You're on my side
I feel now my feel empty
Self-hatred in my soul
With you I lose control
Don't leave me you're all I think about
You're on my mind, you're on my mind
Wake up next to me
I'm in a hospital bed
You're blood is running through my veins
If you die take me instead
I'm dancing with the devil, I smile for you
I'm dancing with the devil, I live for you
I'm dancing on my own, all I need is you
You're on my mind, you're on my mind

[Verse 2]
The spiders of the desert come chasing my dreams
I'm stuck in a hospital bed
I still remember what you said
But now I'm falling
Falling into the fields of love
Falling and I can't get up
I'm in dark water
Ever is you and me
Forever is you and me
Forever is you and me
