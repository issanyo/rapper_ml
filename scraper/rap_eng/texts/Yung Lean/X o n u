[Verse 1: Bladee]
You want to go with me, she wanna take ecstasy
It's  the end for me, take her on a shopping spree
Why you follow me but you acting up to me
Bitch I cannot feel, chemical dependencies
Hundred enemies, I know family
Got my team with me, wherever we wanna be
This is Louie V
She said “you believed in me
I remember when no one would believe in me"
Meet the evil me
GTB with me
Moving secretly
Creeping on the Sweden streets
I'm charged up, I can not get caught up
She was star struck, but I’m feeling heartless
I'm charged up, I can not get caught up
She was star struck, but I’m feeling heartless
I'm charged up, I can not get caught up
She was star struck, but I’m feeling heartless

[Hook: Thaiboy Digital]
Flex on you, flex on you
All I do, flex on you
Flex on you, flex on you
Thaiboy Goon
Will I ever lose? Thaiboy
Flex on you, flex on you
All I do, flex on you
Flex on you, flex on you
All I do, flex on you

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
I don't give a fuck, guess I'm stuck in my way
Lightning strikes, I'm getting money stuck in to this space
I be smoking on this ice, ashes ashes in the tray
Polo, polo Leandoer, bitch I'm floating off in space
Crystal glass in my cup, think I'm numbing off my pain
Hit me, hit me, hit me up when it's night time
In the sofa mixing pills sipping white wine
Table, table made of glass filled with white lines
Evil, evil spirits in my head let them fly by
You know I'm getting money, money when it's light out
Gucci shades on my face when it's light out
Bitch I'm, bitch I'm like Bruce Willis in his prime time
I'm flying in the sky, I feel like Sci-Fi
I'm flying in the sky, I feel like Sci-Fi
All I do is All I do is shine, let it fly by
Leandoer up on sky up on Cloud-9

[Hook: Thaiboy Digital]
Flex on you, flex on you
All I do, flex on you
Flex on you, flex on you
Thaiboy Goon
Will I ever lose? Thaiboy
Flex on you, flex on you
All I do, flex on you
Flex on you, flex on you
All I do, flex on you
