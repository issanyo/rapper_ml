[Verse:]
Waking up to sunlight
Smoke a blunt out the window, everything is alright
I rather be a hood with my homies that stay souped out
Drinkin' the vodka mix with sprite cause I gotta stay souped up
Strobe light green runnin' up like the Joker henchman
Choked up, seen Lean Doer in this shit, some [?]
Poked up, choked up, rolled up
Bitches screaming at us [?] and provoked 'bout nothin'
Itâ€™s strange long until the night fall
Shawty take a drone from my bong by the waterfall
I think this calls for a late night snack
And McDonald's hamburger, milkshake, yeah I'll pay you back
Early morning and the sun if really blisterin' I'm with you sister
Nothin' but panties let's say slitherin' and my dick is really sizzlin'
It's hard and I'm sweaty, cumming on your girlfriend's face
Like I'm Freddy with a machete cause she let me
I did it just to beat the [?]
Pull up on my old school girl just to graduate
Bruce got the OCP, Cause I got the soda cans
Skating, masterbating Summer and we don't need no plans

[Outro:]
By the beach listening to Animal Collective
This beat is really effective
Take the hit fuck it 'bout it later, put it in perspective
Swimming in the ocean and your titties are reflective
