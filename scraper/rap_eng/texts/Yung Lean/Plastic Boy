[Intro: Yung Lean]
Yeah
Sad Boys
GTB

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
See me, flossin', flossin' lean, like a dental health care
Polo, polo everythin', make that denti-denti-dentist scared
Make ya bitches stare, ride on spaceship
Jump on top of my crystal chair
I sip 40's, North face, black neon lightnin' gear
Walk in the back room when I finish shed a tear
Then I buy the sword and the spear, light-year
Kill the game then disappear
Get my dick licked by Britney spear
G-shocks and the silver's clear
Rob the cashier, listen with one ear
Got the game in my hand, I'm the mad hatter, with a sad boys tat
Ratatat

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Olders don't know how to rap, ya know I'm strapped up
Lean’s all around me, I been I been really sippin'
I see dead people, I'm really trippin'
Take 'em to the back and get the snappin'
Cause I'm rich man, cause I'm rich man
(Flex), (Stunt), (Woop)

[Verse 2: Bladee]
Holy sword, shadow Bladee, my girlfriend looks like anime
Never had a car but I'm still inhaling the candy paint
Bladee man, Astroboy, I'm smoking on a asteroid
I'm inside a plastic void, I turn into a plastic boy
Drinking liquid acid out of plastic cups, Jurassic boy
Watch on my wrist, it's all black but it's made of gold
Raining gold, I'll break your soul, my mind is using mind control
In a gold mine with an axe and a superstone
Gucci phone, Coca Cola snow, sending super drones
From the iron throne, put you down like a skeleton
In my bones, silver herringbone like the thunder dome
When I woke up one day, everything was gone

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Olders don't know how to rap, ya know I'm strapped up
Lean’s all around me, I been I been really sippin'
I see dead people, I'm really trippin'
Take 'em to the back and get the snappin'
Cause I'm rich man, cause I'm rich man
