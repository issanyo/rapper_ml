SBE 2003
SBE Bitch

[Hook: Yung Lean]
I'm flexed up, I'm cashed out
I hop out, roll up
Tinted windows on the shits, you know I got my bands up
Tinted windows with my bitch she riding with her xans up
I'm flexed up, I'm cashed out
I hop out, roll up
Tinted windows on the shits, you know I got my bands up
Tinted windows with my bitch she riding with her xans up

[Verse 1: Luckaleannn]
Tinted windows 'round my fucking bitch
And I'm still riding in the 6
And I'm still trapping like a bitch
Your bitch on my motherfucking dick
I still ride around the town on some tents
Boys can't fuck with me cause they some simps
Come up in the booth and heat the shit
I serve your mommy and daddy cause I'm the shit

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Tinted windows on the shits, you know I got my bands up
Tinted windows with my bitch she riding with her xans up
I'm flexed up, I'm cashed out
I hop out, roll up
Tinted windows on the shits, you know I got my bands up
Tinted windows with my bitch she riding with her xans up

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
I'm bossed up, cashed out
Rocks up, stacks out
It's a dream, shawty you already know I'm fucking cashing out
Scarface bitch, now you know there ain't no backing out
Hit em up don't fuck around
All these boys wanna come around
They used to hear me, they don't make a sound
SBE in your town tonight
You know we bring ice out
You know shawty has stacks out
Lean just brought that pack out
[?] bar and we sippin'

[Hook: Yung Lean]
I'm flexed up, I'm cashed out
I hop out, roll up
Tinted windows on the shits, you know I got my bands up
Tinted windows with my bitch she riding with her xans up
I'm flexed up, I'm cashed out
I hop out, roll up
Tinted windows on the shits, you know I got my bands up
Tinted windows with my bitch she riding with her xans up

[Outro: Yung Lean]
Xans out, bands out
You know how we do
Yung Leandoer, Luckaleannn
