[Verse 1: NevaBitch]
Got a big blunt of the ganja

[Verse 2: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Rollin’ up on them 6’s with 2 vixens
They love to eat dick like they at a picnic
Bitches know that my sickness be on some real shit
You feel this? Where I’m from they’ll kill quick
I’m too sick for this rap shit, anthrax shit
She breathe slow to my voice, asthmatic
My presence is like Jurassic tyrannosaurus flex
While them alligators bite, Lake Placid
This a classic, I’m ratchet
You acting like you live this shit I live
But nigga you just acting
They be asking, “Muney how you swag shit”?
Shoutout to that zone 4, boy they on bad shit
Slap a bitch, fuck a trick, pimp shit, suck a dick

Real life shit, bitch yeah I do this shit
Saying that you bout this shit, but you ain't doing shit

[Verse 3: Robb Bank$]
Hey, Hey, your bitch love me for my jewelry
If I talk it then I do this shit
Say you bout that savage life, but boy you ain't foolin’ me
Done walked through flames
Made them thunderthighs reign
Just a name, things ain't been the same, just a little more hundreds
Double S we don’t need a niggas two-cents
Bitch I said bills, I ain’t say nothing bout change
Still walk dolo to the store to buy ports
Black tee, slides
And my fire ripping the stitching out my shorts
Pussy!

[Verse 4: Yung Lean]
From slidin' through I'm 'bout to let you know
Sweden bitch, make this money flow
Sadboys bitch I make the whole room glow
Show up to the show with a top 10 model
You don’t want this and you know I got it
Mission granted, Lean, liquor
Leaves the victim left handed on the beach
Left stranded, tattoo on her backside
Sadboys logo, leave your body abandoned
Leave it shot for the masses
Slow jams, Peter Pan, Captain hooks in Japan
Lay 'em down, in the sand
Told my child that these fuccbois will never understand
Mix it up in the pan
H2o, coke blow, sniff fast, lay low
Snakes in the grass when I get that peso
Sweden bitch, we make this money flow
Sadboys bitch, I make the whole room glow
Show up to the show with a top 10 model
