[Verse 1: Bones]
TeamSESH, Sad Boys, teardrops falling
I'm crying on the beat so it's safe to say I'm balling
Rap Shawn Hunter, all the bitches think I'm gorgeous
They say the flow magic, I'm looking like a shaman
Young white punk, got that switchblade in my pocket
I'm looking for the prophet, the bass stay knocking
When I stay flocking, the pimp keep flowing
You saying that you out here, but Bones don't know you
I'm stepping on the scene, bitch it's me and Yung Lean
Dem Franchize Boyz - white skin, white teeth
Ice cubes in my glass of my Arizona tea
Codeine waterfalls, baptized in the pink
Marble on the floor, white granite on the counter (Counter)
Number one stunning in that baby blue Prowler (Prowler)
Backstreet boys in the alleyway, smoking
SESH be the team till the casket closes, boy

[Hook: Yung Lean & Bones]
Tears rolling down my face
In the night time creeping, gripping tight around my blade
Tears rolling down my face
In the night time creeping, gripping tight around my blade

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Tears rolling down my face
In the night time creeping, grip tight around my blade
Tears rolling down my face
In the night time creeping, grip tight around my blade

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
Crying blood from my eyes, crying blood from my eyes
Young tears, fucking hoes in a Bape mask disguise
Lean and Bones ripping on the kidney stones
Ray Golden playing trombone
Got yo bitch in my bed, you can still hear her moan
No one likes a bitch if she looking like Ke$ha
TeamSESH and Sad Boys, you know we do it better (Get the gold)
Get the cheddar, you bitches should have fed her
I sat through with her while she's wetter, you will find I look fresher
Pull my heart out my sleeve (Lean)
Living a fantasy dream
If you wake up being you, can I wake up being me?
If you wake up being you, can I wake up being Lean?
Young white chubby Lean look spectacular
Fuck a hospital, my doctor's called Dr. Acula
Eat her out, then I beat her down, I'm savage y'all
Call me Basquiat, 'cause I got that caviar

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Tears rolling down my face
In the nighttime, make a Sad Boys logo in my face
Arizona gun in my waist
I'll be fucking with you lames till you caught up in my pace
Tears rolling down my face
In the nighttime, make a Sad Boys logo in my face
Arizona gun in my waist
I'll be fucking with you lames till you caught up in my pace

[Outro: Yung Lean]
