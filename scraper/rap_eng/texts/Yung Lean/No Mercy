[Intro: Yung Bans]
Ripsquadd
Yah
101 shit
Citrus gang
If that pussy nigga owe, huh
Yah ay, huh, ay
Akachi!

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
Y-Young nigga stay solid like you 'posed to
Make yourself a boss, ain't no goin' back to old you
You could turn a hunnit to a million if you want to
Shoot 'em in the face, if that pussy nigga owe you
Yeah, if that pussy nigga owe, aye
You can't show no mercy
They a try you like a ho, aye
Ridin' round the city, tryna get it with my woe
Can't depend on nobody, yeah
That's what I was told

[Verse 1: Yung Bans]
Can't depend on nobody, that's what I know
'Cause niggas see the light, they try to leave you on the floor
Try to leave you in a ditch
Nigga, I was down bad
Now they all up in my face, 'cause a nigga count cash, aye
Keep countin' cash, aye
Watch 'em and I laugh, aye
Pussy stole my sound, huh, I don't need it back, yeah
In the ocean, nigga, this a shark attack
I'm the realest, all these pussy niggas wet

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
Young nigga stay solid like you 'posed to
Make yourself a boss, ain't no goin' back to old you
You could turn a hunnit to a million if you want to
Shoot 'em in the face, if that pussy nigga owe
Yeah, if that pussy nigga owe
Aye, you can't show no mercy
They a try you like a ho, aye
Ridin' round the city tryna get it with my woe
Can't depend on nobody, yeah
That's what I was told

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
Feelin' fresh, servin' clean
Double cup, lime cream
What a scene, obscene
My eyes, nothin' worth to see
Mint fresh, servin' clean
Turn a hunnit to a key
Sixty bands, my verse fee
Look in my eyes nothin' to see
I'ma point the way (SadBoys in this bitch!)
Free Yung Bans like he's on my team, fuckin' tee
Racked up, taked up
Checked up, send dope
Can't take it out the window
Cops watchin' my info

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
Aye, young nigga stay solid like you 'posed to
Make yourself a boss, ain't no goin' back to old you
You could turn a hunnit to a million if you want to
Shoot 'em in the face, if that pussy nigga owe you
Yeah, if that pussy nigga owe
You can't show no mercy
They a try you like a ho, aye
Ridin' round the city tryna get it with my woe
Can't depend on nobody, yeah
That's what I was told
