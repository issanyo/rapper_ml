[Intro]
Way up
Way up
Some up

[Hook]
I'm rollin' blowin away, the days are the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith
Rubber, rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait
I'm rollin' blowin away, the days are the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith
Rubber, rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait

[Verse 1]
I guess I gotta stay down, stay down, stay down
I guess I gotta stay down, stay down, stay down
Bitch, I'll be around, around, around forever
I'll be around, around somewhere up there
Na-na-na-na-na, I just saw the sign, I seen the world collide
I lost count of all the times, she ask me why
Ma-ma-magic in her eyes, Leandoer's paradise
All my, all my, boys off drugs, I've been lost in this life
Fire flames, color red, 'member recent times
Stacks of shoes, got soo many, don't really the 'mount
When it's hot outside, I copped me some ice
Travel in disguise, I see trouble in her eyes
Mix it with fanta, not with sprite, wings from Calvin Klein
Forever i'll fly, all the times I remind, cause someway...
Someway, some how, I'm good in the sky
I got a white shirt and a tangerine belt
In a winter where the show don't melt
Cause I keep to myself, cause I keep to myself
Rollin', rollin', rollin', I know, ah

[Hook]
I'm rollin' blowin away, the days are the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith
Rubber, rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait
I'm rollin' blowin away, the days are the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith
Rubber, rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait
I'm rollin' blowin away, the days are the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith
Rubber, rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait

[Verse 2]
(?) love the sign, I've been through 'em nights
Fallin' from the heights, I'm a dog, about to bite
All my dogs gon' ride tonight, I got armor I'm a knight
I got stars up on my knife, I got stars up on my knife
Remember when I step on Nikes, I don't pay for that shit now
Any motherfucker tryna tell me shit now
Back down, back down, you don't wanna get it now
Move around the streets like the city is on fire now
Fire house, money count, shawty, I'm on fire now
Greygoose, blowin' pineapples in a cyber town
Higher down, fire crown, Leany get 'em by the ounce
