[Intro: Prada Mane]
Yung Sherm on the beat
He's looking forward to us
It's been a long time
We've been waiting for you
R.I.P to the game
I'm sorry but I had to

Me, P-R-A-D Yung Prada-da-da
I've been coming through fresher than your Fatha-da-da
And your motha-da-da
Call me yung parents
I don’t wanna dare you bruh, but we just been daring
I don't want to cook the meals we been preparin'
We been cooking in the kitchen, while you been staring
I don't Pyrex, bruh
My cell don't text, nah
She can go hit up another dude if she next
I don't really wanna see 'em, cause then I gotta defeat 'em
Yung Lean with Yung Prada

I don't really wanna see 'em cause then I gotta defeat 'em
Yung Lean with Yung Prada

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
Lean
Y'all try to be like Lean
Nobody as high as me
Me and Prada in the sky
Can't you see me with the paint and yellow light cheese
Coke and pretzels sweet
Prada boxers, Ralph Lauren cologne
Sadboys and Prada on that Patrón
Catch me in a jet
I'm like Arthur with the stone
Yung Lean and Prada the new Flintstones
Cartoon Network on my Prada phone
I time travel Lean wanna take a time loan
Energy and decisions put my team in your division
Taking over the world is my mission (mission)
I'm time travelling wanna take a time loan
I wanna rap like me bitch cause I'm all alone
