[Intro: Yung Lean]
Chaki Zulu
Lean
Shoutouts Tokyo
Whatever you like, bitch I got it
You need coke, pills, dro, yea I'm on it

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Call my boys, bitch hop on it, make 'em poppin'
Leandoer, I'm exhausted, I be coughin' in that coffin
With my Tokyo boys in that white Rolls Royce
Make 'em mad, I'm in Yen land
Godzilla blunt hands, SBE
Cold nights, ten stacks
Fuckin' up the world, I been doin' that forever, man
(Sadboys)

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
I'm in Tokyo, Tokyo drift, rollin' off a pill
'Member when I was a kid, I was hungry for this shit
Now I roll up to the club, baseball bat, where they at?
I got gold on my mat, I got hoes on my back
Rollin' green off a flat, spend a million yen, get it back
Yeah we get it back, bitch

[Verse 2: MonyHorse]
Welcome to Japan, pop pussy with Champagne
悲しい男達とする人生のgame
首腕にタトゥー
Bitch, I don’t fuck with you
We living free, doing it all
Fuck rap game, weed cocaine
Sippin' on codeine, just like Yung Lean
It’s ok, 見るがいい俺達のshowcase

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Boys, bitch hop on it, make 'em poppin'
Leandoer, I'm exhausted, I be coughin' in that coffin
With my Tokyo boys in that white Rolls Royce
Make 'em mad, I'm in Yen land
Godzilla blunt (SBE)
Cold nights, ten stacks
Fuckin' up the world, I been doin' that forever, man

[Verse 3: PETZ]
ここの魔所は良し,   これが Yentown shit
いつもとり口に ピル , ここは Wi-Fi free
Chillin' in the cut, Yung Lean right next to me
これが Sadboys shit, 皆同じも好き (好き)
Smoke weed all day, 俺 invincible
遣りたい事なら遣る let’s do it

[Verse 4: Bladee]
You look weak, I'm a drain gang hero
I got zeroes and zeroes and zeroes
I feel like summer's close, that's why I'm blowin' smoke
I feel like comin' home, but you know I gotta go
I'm up in Tokyo, runnin' but I'm movin' slow
Crawlin' on the road, Motorola Razr phone
SG, SG, 'til the death of me
Got the knife with me, GTBSBE
Fuck my enemies, silver vampire teeth
I got blood on me, jewelry on ecstasy

[Verse 5: Junkman]
悲しい少年、新しい挑戦
Japanese flow the right way
楽しい errday, 毎日冒険
Cop what we want, got something extra
有難う, すいません
東京, Yentown, Yung Leanバック、 イェ
俺達なら Grey、宇宙から来た
Sadboys, dope as fuck

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Call my boys, bitch hop on it, make 'em poppin'
Leandoer, I'm exhausted, I be coughin' in that coffin
With my Tokyo boys in that white Rolls Royce
Make 'em mad, I'm in Yen land
Godzilla blunt, SBE
Cold nights, ten stacks
Fuckin' up the world, I been doin' that forever, man
