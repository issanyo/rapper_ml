[Chorus]
I got electricity running through my veins
I got everything who am I to blame
Stand like the flowers in the rain
Smoking this dope, I think I'm going insane
Moving through the city, with my keys in the snow
Time running through my hands, I have to let it go, have to let it go
In the shadows of the city of my mind nothing matters anymore it's just a matter of time
Until we fall back and meet again feed my needs again
Posted with my friends I resurrect to rise again

[Verse]
They call me crazy at least they talking straight
Shock first so they listen now thatâ€™s my faith
Cop a real estate out in winterland made it out
Bless my fate
Just be you it's never too late
All I do is great
Sprinkle the hash let me live fast
Show up last with the biggest bands
Least love for the biggest fans
I'm a weirdo so to the weirdos I give back
Roses in my bathtub, leave your blood in a black mug
Used to be a hobby now it's all I think about
That's what rap does
Too many lames tryna do what I've done
Silk print loafers I don't work for no one
Moving through the city and I just begun
Too many lames tryna do what I've done
Silk print loafers I don't work for no one
Moving through the city, Yung Lean SBE just begun

[Chorus]
I got electricity running through my veins
I got everything who am I to blame
Stand like the flowers in the rain
Smoking this dope, I think I'm going insane
Moving through the city, with my keys in the snow
Time running through my hands, I have to let it go, have to let it go
In the shadows of the city of my mind nothing matters anymore it's just a matter of time
Until we fall back and meet again feed my needs again
Posted with my friends I resurrect to rise again
I got electricity running through my veins
I got everything who am I to blame
Stand like the flowers in the rain
Smoking this dope, I think I'm going insane
Moving through the city, with my keys in the snow
Time running through my hands, I have to let it go, have to let it go
In the shadows of the city of my mind nothing matters anymore it's just a matter of time
Until we fall back and meet again feed my needs again
