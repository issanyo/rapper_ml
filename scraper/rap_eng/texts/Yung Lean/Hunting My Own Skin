[Hook]
We were on the throne, livin' on our own (livin' on our own)
Huntin' my own skin, want it to break in (break it in)
She just wanna dance, I'mma get them bands
Make a lot of stacks, bitch, I'd die for my respect

[Bridge 1]
Wrist, diamonds, ice, neon green lights
Don't care about the price, I cop it, I smash it, this size
Wrist, diamonds, ice, percocet, my Sprite
Perkys in my Sprite, Louis bag, three stripes

[Verse 1]
As I walk through the fire with my wings
I could only stop for this iron like a lane
She just want to pop all the molly in the Benz
I've been gettin' rich, makin' money with my friends
Bitch, we off them shits, time to stay until the end
I'm just tryna pop all the bottles, fuck the feds
I got 50 pills all up in Armani bags
She gon' watch how I spend it, like, just to get it back
Sittin' on the field, snakes through the money tracks
Breaking in and entering, bitch, we poppin' tags
Keep the fire burnin' off a blunt like candle wax
Burnin' down your money 'til it ain't nothin' to stack

[Hook]
We were on the throne, livin' on our own (livin' on our own)
Huntin' my own skin, want it to break in (break it in)
She just wanna dance, I'mma get them bands
Make a lot of stacks, bitch, I'd die for my respect

[Bridge 2]
Flick all my lights, chain, dirty Sprite
Livin' my life, I'm alright, shawty, she my type
Die for this I might, chains all freeze outside
Flick all my lights, chain, dirty Sprite

[Verse 2]
As I hop by the avenue with my wings
Baby, don't stop, wanna give you everything
When we off them rocks, I'mma tell you everything
Soap on my shoes and on my heart, it's getting thin
But you're a butterfly ridin' through the desert winds
I'm a really bad, I love all the finer things
When I come close, close to you I can't sin
Heaven knows I'm bad, but Lord, I can't fix a thing
Fly too close to the sun, my wings give in
I gave you my whole life, don't owe you a thing
As I chose life and this rug made of mink
Burnin' down the winter 'cause I'm over everything

[Hook]
We were on the throne, livin' on our own (Leandoer,  Stranger)
Huntin' my own skin, want it to break in (break it in)
She just wanna dance, I'mma get them bands
Make a lot of stacks, bitch, I'd die for my respect
