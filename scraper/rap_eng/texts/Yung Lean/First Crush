[Intro x2: Bladee]
I want to be like you
Feel like you, real like you
Walk like you, talk like you
In your skin, me and you

[Verse 1: Bladee]
When I blow out the candles the room turns black
When I look in the mirror my face don't match
When I think 'bout you baby, my eyes turn black
And I still think about you I can't go back

[Verse 2: ECCO2K]
6 bags amnesia, to forget my past
Still trapped, nobody under my black mask
Skull cracked, no touching I got glitter hands
Make a blood pact, me and you, forever lasting

[Verse 3: Bladee]
Make a wish for you baby, the wish turns blue
K-9 in the airport I look for you
When I look in the mirror the light turns green
Cause you don't feel like me

[Verse 4: ECCO2K]
Check my blood-work, how much is my blood worth
We sending controlled substances through customs
I'm not a crusher, I deserve to suffer
I know that love hurts but sometimes I wonder

[Hook: ECCO2K]
Three sixes, two thirds
Thirty percent dirt
Sleeping under earth
Wake up, end the world
Who'll still my hunger
Who'll quench my thirst
First crush, you got burned
I'm ten percent sugar

[Verse 5: Yung Lean]
Give no fuck about the fame, make me stressed out
I be with the same, make you stretched out
Baby got my back, like a rest now
Ain't got no confidence, but I'm blessed now
I don't walk like you shawty, flexed out
You know it's still SBE and Drain Gang
Walk up in the club, they make it rain xans
Everybody talking, I'm the same man

[Hook: ECCO2K]
Three sixes, two thirds
Thirty percent dirt
Sleeping under earth
Wake up, end the world
Who'll still my hunger
Who'll quench my thirst
First crush, you got burned
I'm ten percent sugar
