[Chorus]
I'm blowin' money, fallin' from the sky, think I'm Bruce Willis
Cocaine the king, super wild, think I’m too pretty
Money stuck under my mattress, think that I’m the tooth fairy
Flying around the clouds, I think I'm Ganondorf I'm too scary
I'm blowin' money, fallin' from the sky, think I'm Bruce Willis
Cocaine the king, super wild, think I’m too pretty
Money stuck under my mattress, think that I’m the tooth fairy
Flying around the clouds, I think I'm Ganondorf I'm too scary

[Verse]
I'm super charged, money extra large
Posted up, flyin' up, in that Mario Kart
I get it fast, poppin' ecstasy when I'm up on Mars
Extra fast, like Sonic when I'm off the bars
All you know is alcohol and white lines
All I'm on is Adderall and bright lights
Walking through the gates of hell, I'm iced out
I am just wishful that it's night time
I feel like a city with no people in it
Ghost city, I can't breathe up in there
When I'm with you I don't feel so empty
Got a silver steel knife made by Fendi
I don't wanna live anymore, don't wanna be twenty
LSD dreams thank God, can't comprehend

[Chorus]
I'm blowin' money, fallin' from the sky, think I'm Bruce Willis
Cocaine the king, super wild, think I’m too pretty
Money stuck under my mattress, think that I’m the tooth fairy
Flying around the clouds, I think I'm Ganondorf I'm too scary
I'm blowin' money, fallin' from the sky, think I'm Bruce Willis
Cocaine the king, super wild, think I’m too pretty
Money stuck under my mattress, think that I’m the tooth fairy
Flying around the clouds, I think I'm Ganondorf I'm too scary
