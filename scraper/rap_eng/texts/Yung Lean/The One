Babygirl you the only girl I love
I don't fuck with no one - girl you are the one
And you understand, I don't give a damn
Gettin' all the grams just for us
Fucked then I walk up in the store, just buy our clothes
No Saint Laurent
Gotta do shit for mom, my sis, my dad, and you, my aunt
Babygirl you the only girl I love
I don't fuck with no one - Girl you are the one
And you understand, I don't give a damn
Gettin all the grams just for us
Fucked then I walk up in the store, just buy our clothes

Shawty know I ball ball ball, hit the mall mall mall

Ride to you, your arms arms arms
Baby you're my all
Wanna do everything together
Girl you changed the weather

Babygirl I just wanna be with you
Sleep with you, eat with you

Everywhere we go is alright
Fuck it - I can take the next flight
Everywhere we go is alright
Everywhere we go
