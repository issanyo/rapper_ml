[Chorus]
Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger
When I come up in the booth you know I drop it
Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexin' with my new girl
When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it
Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger
When I come up in the booth you know I drop it
Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexin' with my new girl
When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it

[Verse]
I been droppin' out of helicopters
Hoppin' out of buses
Dropped like 20 on a pinky ring
My stacks sure got them muscles
And my words are like a skeleton
My keychain made in Brussels
I got diamonds on my telephone
You know that Lean done hustled
Neck filled with rose gold
It look like a logo
Hangin' like the old folks
Icy like the north pole
Live my life in slow-mo
Happy when I'm solo
Sun hotter than Togo
My zone is a no go

[Chorus]
Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger
When I come up in the booth you know I drop it
Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexin' with my new girl
When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it
Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger
When I come up in the booth you know I drop it
Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexin' with my new girl
When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it

[Verse 2]
Skis on me, it's hot, drop the fuckin' top
Keychain on my Paris Hilton dog, I've seen a lot
Why not come with us, xannies in the Tuss
I feel like Johnny Depp like from the Blow
Sippin' on a 40, my life is a late night show
I can't understand it when I'm low
(drop it)
Bitches, they come after us
We used to lay on the bus
Hours and hours of dumbin'
Ain’t no more runnin' I’m vicious for lust
Lean, lost in the woods, you know I can not speak
My boys blowin' loud, eyes lookin' like peeks
Soldiers of another world, I'm fallin' into seas
Dark counters, white shadows leanin' over me

[Chorus]
Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger
When I come up in the booth you know I drop it
Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexin' with my new girl
When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it
Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger
When I come up in the booth you know I drop it
Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexin' with my new girl
When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it

[Outro]
Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexin' with my new girl
When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it
Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger
When I come up in the booth you know I drop it
