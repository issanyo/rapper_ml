Sandman, CEO
SBE, cash man
Damn man, Shawty got it bad with her last man
Fat pants, big diamonds, sipping jasmine
Roll up to the mountain and I'm dripping all black, man
True friends only roll with true friends
Green tea, straight out the tin can
Think man, reminisce on what has, has been, hash man
Throw my  conscious in the trash can, trash man
That is what they said i'd be,it's has been a good year
It's is time to raise the glass man
Cops man, fuck the police, let them blast them down
Fattens, all my money fattens
What the hell happened Fishscale salmon
Hop on the bandwagon

[Verse 1]
All I do is golden, work more then Saffron
Plasma's, all my TV's plasma's
Patterns, you can see the patterns in my passion
Only role companions
Wonderland, i'm in Wonderland like i'm Alice
My palace, is going to fast, let me fasten seat belt
Loui V, can you imagine
MDMA, no Montana
Let me bring this back to land man
Abandoned, leave you abandoned
Fuck with me and you know we leave you abandoned
Let me bring this back to land man, it's has been a good year, bitch it's time to raise the glass man
