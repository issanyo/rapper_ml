[Hook: Yung Lean]
I love how she dancing, got me feeling for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through
I love how she dancing, got me feeling for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
I be grinding making money, it's for me and you
I love the way you dancing and your top is see through
We can go up to the stars, see clouds and fall through
Money in my pocket and you know I want you
I've been busy, got so much work, I can't always be with you
Percocets my system, when I go to sleep I know it's you
When I was in the hospital I saw you
I know what you're feeling inside cause I feel you
I gotta stay true, my money rain blue
Hennessy and Sailor Moon, I just wanna be with you
I know what you're feeling inside cause I know I feel you
My money rain blue, Hennessy and Sailor Moon

[Hook: Yung Lean]
I love how she dancing, got me feeling for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through
I love how she dancing, got me feeling for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through

[Verse 2: Bladee]
She shouldn't have to ask, whatever she wants
I stay up till dawn, barbwire on my arm
They won't see me fall, they won't see me fall
I don't care at all, I'm a young rockstar
Living in the dark, living in the dark
Leandoer the God, we've been going hard
Ever since she called, I don't have a heart
I went to the stars
What you want from me? I can get it for you
Get it for you
You don't want me, do you?
You don't want me, do you?
Know what I'll do to you

[Hook: Yung Lean]
I love how she dancing, got me feeling for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through
I love how she dancing, got me feeling for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through
