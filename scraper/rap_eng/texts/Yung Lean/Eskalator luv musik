Yeah
Sad boys baby
Swarm for the hoes
Ay yo,ay yo bitch bring your friend
I got my nigga Yung Lean
Slime dude

[Hook:Lofty305]
If I invite you out
Girl dont sike me out
GIrl i just wanna show you how i wife you
If I invite you out
Girl dont sike me out
Girl i just wanna fuck you
Spend some good time

[Verse 1:Lofty305]
Yeah money on my mind
Bitch im fresh off the grid
Im just tryna lay down on the beach with my tay
And just look at your smile
Turn my frown upside down
Fuck you in the ocean
Girl I hope that We go ground
As we sinking go down
Turn the bottom of the sea
I see you underwear
(?)
Listen me only me
Your hands is all that I see
When I take a show
You happy listen (?)

[Verse 2:Yung Lean]
Baby pink choppers
Baby pink gear
Better (?) I’m in ocean,no fear
We ride dirty,whip your ass
Smoking hash
(?)
Counting stacks
30 grams
Sipping up fast
I’m doing better
Counting cheddar
My room teammate is crying blood
Eating fruits
I got the magic,full power
Dressed plane,I’m dividing fruit lips
Burning tires outside
(?)
I come through the fire
I used to grind I won this flyer
I slide through,I come through
Lofty305 Sad boys what the fuck you gonna do
I slide through,I come through
Lofty305 Sad boys what you gonna do
