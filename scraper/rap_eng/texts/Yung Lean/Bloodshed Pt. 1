[Verse 1: Malibu]
Drowns
Time, gave you
To one day
How it would be
How it could (could) be (be)
Time, okay

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
I don't give a fuck, my mind on blast
Feels like I am stuck
Gucci on my pants
I just wanna love you
I know that I can't, I can't always be with you
And it makes me sad
I don't give a fuck, my mind on blast
Feels like I am stuck
Gucci on my pants
I just wanna love you
I know that I can't, I can't always be with you
And it makes me sad
All these motherfuckers mad
But I don't give a fuck
Leave me in an ocean
Drive off a cliff in a truck
Polo on my shirt, Louis V, troubled kid
I be in the club off a pill, don't feel shit
Shawty said she'd love me like a Gucci glove would fit
I said we gon' fuck the world let me handle this
Broken bottles, broken dreams in the night like a fiend
I just want you, I just want you

[Verse 3 x2: Uli K]
Think you know this
I hate to show it
Feeling so lonely
I can't control it
So much bloodshed
We keep on going
Don't wanna leave you
But I feel so broken
