[Hook]
She off the pills, and I ask "Do you wanna?"
She's just mumbling, blood coming out her head
I'm off the drink, off the blow, I'm just gonna
We in a bathtub, we good here, everywhere

[Bridge]
She's off the pil-pill, we off the pills
She's just mumbling, blood coming out her head
I'm off the drink, the drink, the drink
I'm off the drink, off the-
We in a bathtub, we good here and everywhere

[Verse]
I'm in Hawaii, and you know we in a Rover
Bitches all on us, knock on my door like Jehova
Promote a set, ain't nobody came til you showed up
Leave me 500 bands exactly when I show up
I'm not feeling too interested, I'm just modest
I couldn't stop it, I met the girl we was knockin'
We sipping champagne and the blow, we keep it on us
See us in the club, you know we keep the knives on us
And I be driving in the fast lane, ain't no way to stop us
I don't wanna go on, but you know we just say "fuck it"

[Hook]
She off the pills, and I ask "Do you wanna?"
She's just mumbling, blood coming out her head
I'm off the drink, off the blow, I'm just gonna
We in a bathtub, we good here, everywhere

[Outro]
She's off the pil-pill, we off the pills
She's just mumbling, blood coming out her head
I'm off the drink, the drink, the drink
I'm off the drink, off the-
We in a bathtub, we good here and everywhere
She's off the pil-pill, we off the pills
She's just mumbling, blood coming out her head
I'm off the drink, the drink, the drink
I'm off the drink, off the-
We in a bathtub, we good here and everywhere
