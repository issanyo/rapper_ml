[Hook: Bladee]
We sleepin', and we wake up in the evenin'
Creepin', Lamborghini with a demon
Weed feelin' like I’m goin' home and sleepin'
Out here, no one hears you when your screamin'
I was bleedin', rollin', I was dreamin''
Touch Sweden, then I have to leave them
SG them, I'mma go and meet them
Chillin' in the city with no reason

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
(Leandoer!)
Too many mutants, I'm tryna be fluent
Tailored star ships, lookin' stupid
My body be full of fluids, this a movement, this my unit
I'm the janitor, clean it up, I can not be muted
It's my day off like I'm Ferris Bueller
Out the parkin' lot, astro boys smokin' pot
Turn your flesh to rot, sippin' Ciroc, fuck the law
Purple pills in my jaw, bag it up, I need it all
Beautiful ruins and floatin' houses
I'm trippin' on lucid, yeah
Nail polish on the wheels, look how they go
Leandoer make you kneel in the lab with a rope
Candy color on a mobile, on the side blowin' dope
I think I need more

[Hook: Bladee]
We sleepin', and we wake up in the evenin'
Creepin', Lamborghini with a demon
Weed feelin' like I’m going home and sleepin'
Out here, no one hears you when your screamin'
I was bleedin' rollin' I was dreamin'
Touch Sweden, then I have to leave them
SG them, I'mma go and meet them
Chillin' in the city with no reason

[Verse 2: Bladee]
We make 50 songs then we delete them
They wanna get noticed I don't see them
Who the fuck are you? and why we speakin'?
Drain, drain, drain all of your feelings
It's Monday but it's feelin' like the weekend
I'm sick gotta go and get the treatment
Where you at bitch? I'm somewhere in the eastern
(Where you at? Where you at?)
If you bring me the shit then we'll call it even

[Hook: Bladee]
We sleepin', and we wake up in the evenin'
Creepin', Lamborghini with a demon
Weed feelin' like I’m goin' home and sleepin'
Out here, no one hears you when your screamin'
I was bleedin' rollin' I was dreamin'
Touch Sweden, then I have to leave them
SG them, I'mma go and meet them
Chillin' in the city with no reason
