[Verse]
Green Hellcat mix matched with the jetpack
Stacks, rubberband man, land jugger, ten band
Damn, Stockholm City, frozen snakes, Gucci headband
Damn shawty, way too bad, went to hell and sent back
Look back, look back, I don't wanna look back
Shook head, loud pack, ridin' with a mousetrap
Snakeskin on my timbs, fuck my swag, they took that
(Cops in the alley, fuck that)

[Hook]
Ice on, fight's on, Lean got the lights on
Do wrong, new song, new day, new cakes (Lean)
New world, no brakes
I be switching on money and hand out two of the bricks

[Refrain]
Slowly, house fake, word lake, generate, cherry-colored birthplace
Lean in the club, it's an earthquake
Got the cash, no safe
Feeling like I'm Sauron, got that mask on my face

[Verse 2]
Yellow-covered mattress in the set where we scope
We the type of boys to change the game and go broke
I don't give a fuck, she ride me til my bone broke
Champagne nightmare, Fendi, fight fair, wizards with ropes
Yellow-covered mattress in the set where we scope
We the type of boys to change the game and go broke
I don't give a fuck, she ride me til my bone broke
Champagne nightmare, Fendi, fight fair, wizards with ropes

[Hook]
Ice on, fight's on, Lean got the lights on
Do wrong, new song, new day, new cakes (Lean)
New world, no brakes
I be switching on money and hand out two of the bricks

[Refrain]
Slowly, house fake, word lake, generate, cherry colored birthplace
Lean in the club, it's an earthquake
Got the cash, no safe
Feeling like I'm Sauron, got that mask on my face

[Outro]
Ay
New world, no brakes
I be switching on money and hand out two of the bricks
Ay
What you really on?
