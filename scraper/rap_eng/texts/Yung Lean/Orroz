[Hook:]
All I do is fantastic
Ghost rider, ridin' 'round in traffic
Puff it then I puff it, never pass it
All these smiles on my face, super plastic
All I do is fantastic
Ghost rider, ridin' 'round in traffic
Puff it then I puff it, never pass it
All these smiles on my face, super plastic

[Verse]
I'm the prince of expires
Lasers shootin' out my eyes
Ridin' out the windows with my windows like it's 05'
Day time, leave it now
Leanin' leanin' you can't see me now
Fuck with me, I'll beat you down
Fuck with me and I'll free these clowns
I be rockin' Trues, I be rockin' Hardy
Louis, Gucci, Polo, see me sippin' that Bacardi
All about this paper, no stapler on these papers
Poppin' pills like a raver
Switchin' lanes like a racer

[Hook:]
All I do is fantastic
Ghost rider, ridin' 'round in traffic
Puff it then I puff it, never pass it
All these smiles on my face, super plastic
