[Hook 1: Baba Stilz]
I don't feel no pain
I don't care cause I don't feel no pain
I don't really care
I don't feel no pain
I don't care cause I don't feel no pain

[Verse: Yung Lean]
Hate, love, driving Ford
Drop top, rockin' Ralph Lauren
Hat to upgrade, we love soup pourin'
Milk and cereal like every mornin'
No lies in my mouth I don't speak corny
Stockholm ridin' for lean, don't we?
Tell your friends that I'm dead, homie
No soul, no life, just blood on me
Keep my boys around, all you others bore me
Don't talk to no one, don't steal my glory
Fuck, fuck my glory, the whole world ignores me
And I'm stuck in my room till that snorts it
G-shock, G-shock round my wrist, wearing Gucci boots
Looking at myself like "why you wearin' that stupid human suit?"
I relive for recruit, I survive and I shoot
Magic powers, I use, you hate me, I assume
Don't give a fucks about you, being myself's kind of cool
Everyplace on the news, Lean's always on the move
I can't handle no booze, livin' my dreams, I need you
If you talk that's on you, I brought Sweden back on the moon

[Hook 2: Baba Stilz]
Feeling so worthless
I don't feel ok
I don't care cause I don't feel no pain
I don't really care
I don't feel no pain
I don't care cause I don't feel no pain
