[Hook]
Push, push, put the pedal down like push
Push, push, I'm with my baby and we up

[Verse 1]
Yung Lean, baby, on my blue shirt
Dropped the window down empty the sugar
Pushed the pedal down, she got hunnids on her flow
I've been ridin' around, I got xannies on the floor
Chain all froze, lips don't close
Leandoer, baby, I got whips on a go
I can take you anywhere that you like
Private island, Percocet with a sprite

[Hook]
Push, push, we ballin' like swoosh, swoosh
Push, push, I'm with my baby and we up

[Verse 2]
See-through windows, it's so breezy
Turquoise pills, right now, life seems easy
I can get you anything, we hit the Gucci store
Bats flyin' 'round, lost weekend, you my rose
She know, see her everywhere that I look
She go faster than lightning, we go swoosh

[Hook]
Push, push, put the pedal down like push
Push, push, I'm with my baby and we up
Push, push, we balling like swoosh, swoosh
Push, push, I'm with my baby and we up

[Outro]
Ya, ya, ya, got my bands up quick
Ya, ya, ya, got my bands up quick
Ya, ya, ya, got my bands, bands quick
Ya, ya, ya, got my bands up quick
