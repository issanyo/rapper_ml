[Hook]
Sun on my neck, I’ll ride for my set
No remorse, no respect, press play as I wreck
I got sun on my neck, I’ll ride for my set
Big "S" on my check, everything high tech
I got sun on my neck, I’ll ride for my set
No remorse, no respect , dope in my air force
I got sun on my neck, press play as I press wreck
A big "S" on my check, everything high tech

[Verse 1]
Put it down for Princess Peach
But you could never hear me preach
I’m in the mountains in the trees
I’m smoking silver, eyes Chinese
I’ll blow and puff, and I’ll pass around
I’ll make the catch, don’t make a sound
Fuck what you heard the city’s mine
The city’s mine, I’ll put it down
I’ll put it down for everyone around me
You could try and look for me
But you could never find me
Get behind me
I’m hearing police sirens
I’m smoking burnt tires
I got spirit flowers wasting money every hour
You don’t like me, you a liar
I’m a-I’m a sacrificer
Get my palace like I’m Malice
Floating floating floating empire
All I do is get higher, never tired
You can’t touch me, cause I’m made of wire
Pick my phone up call the supplier
I spit fire, ice-ice red vampire
Icy diamond sapphire
Bitch I am an empire
Flying through the dessert
Moonlight like my dresshirts
Face filled with dirt
Curren-currency convert
