잊지 마
Underwater squad
여전히 몸엔 camo
Orca ninjas go rambo
잊지 마
Underwater squad
여전히 몸엔 camo
Orca ninjas go rambo

[Verse: Yung Lean]
Oh my god, I'm selfish
I can't help it, made myself rich
Smoking green just like the Celtics
In Miami, yellow earrings
Yeah, we started all these trends
With the same clique, no new friends
Underwater ship
Shipping boxes, making flip
Pink diamonds on my wrist
Sadboys we in this bitch
Need a double cup, my hand
Popping pills like Scooby-snacks
Seeing colors, Applejacks
Please, I can't excuse my being
SBE rolling of a bean
Gucci, Louis on my team
They knew, we were a problem
They knew, not to fuck with Lean
