[Hook: Baba Stiltz]
I can buy you lemonade, buy you drugs
I can buy you lemonade, buy you
I can, I can
I can buy you lemonade, buy you drugs
I can buy you lemonade, buy you drugs
I can buy you lemonade, buy you drugs
I can buy you lemonade, buy you

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Coke up in the swisher, switching lanes like switching pictures
It’s just it’s just where my stitches
Turn into the neatest riches
Hand around the shoulder I see neon kisses
I'm balling, balling dunk and throw
'Til my hand starts twitching, twitching
Y'all think I'm so weird, I ain't really human, I'm revered
Couldn't give less fucks about my career
Posted in a spaceship showing no fear
No one heard about Lean a month ago, ago
I was in my bedroom making music, yo
I make no sense, make nonsense
Should've played in the face of the window from my Benz
Stunting all you haters, I jumped over the fence
Jumped over the chase, jumped up on top of her
With my AK-47 in the face
Take you back to heaven, it's a race
Counting stacks, smoking daze
Bey Bey-blades to count up my pace

[Refrain: Yung Lean & Baba Stiltz]
I can buy you lemonade, I can buy you drugs
Arizona tears, Arizona tears
I can buy you drugs
Arizona tears, Arizona tears
Blood tears on my face all I've got is excalibur
Shawty ain't gonna slide through, how the fuck I'm gonna die for her
Blood tears on my face
Shawty ain't gonna slide through, how the fuck I'm gonna die for her
Blood tears on my face all I've got is excalibur
Shawty ain't gonna slide through, how the fuck I'm gonna die for her
Blood tears on my face all I've got is excalibur
Shawty ain't gonna slide through, how the fuck I'm gonna die for her

[Outro: Yung Lean]
Coke up in the swisher, switching lanes like switching bitches
It’s just it’s just where my stitches turn into Looney Tunes riches
Hand around the shoulder I see neon kisses
I'm balling, balling dunk and throw
'Til my hand starts twitching, twitching

[Hook repeated until end of song]
I can buy your lemonade, buy your drugs
