[Hook]
Hold up cause I gotta roll up
Doin' donuts Euros don't fold up
Four blunts on the road for four months
I don't like takin' pictures please ignore us
I'm abnormal, Gargamel cruisin' in the four door
We rollin' deep swisher sweets to my portal
Nine cat lives got nine silver knives
I got big red eyes and I'm feelin' so immortal

[Verse 1]
Welcome to my corridor
Feelin' like a Warlord
Exoskeleton, I became a martyr
Mexico by night if you wanna take a charter
Grind a little harder
Snow white seven dwarves, chains on baller
10 black bottles with my boys overseas
Cadillac's like melted cheese
Money in my time machine
Went to China set me free
Silver screens on silver screens
Chandeliers I make believe
I just do, as I please
Sippin' lean as I sleep
Countin' money like a sheep
Baddest bitch on the side of me
She go
Cause she know
It's all that I need
Cause she know
Cause she go
All my trees
Look like seeds
Feelin' so immortal (Lean)
Feelin' like a Warlord
My Breeze, my chain, my watch
Make you freeze
My Breeze, my chain, my watch
Make you freeze

[Hook]
Hold up cause I gotta roll up
Doin' donuts Euros don't fold up
Four blunts on the road for four months
I don't like takin' pictures please ignore us
I'm abnormal, Gargamel cruisin' in the four door
We rollin' deep swisher sweets to my portal
Nine cat lives got nine silver knives
I got big red eyes and I'm feelin' so immortal

[Outro]
I'm abnormal, Gargamel cruisin' in the four door
We rollin' deep swisher sweets to my portal
Nine cat lives got nine silver knives
I got big red eyes and I'm feelin' so immortal
