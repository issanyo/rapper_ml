[Intro]
Take it all the way, ayy

[Verse 1]
Friday the 13th, you with the maniacs
We the wave makers, this is Navy rap
We both fucked up, I had to take you back
I ain't really sleeping, I take baby naps
Won't make it home, won't make it back
Crib filled with blow, we brought the Eytys back
R.I.P. Barron, for you we blow a sack
Can't leave my boys, yeah I got your back
Lean need a birch, shawty bringing stacks
Haunted house, yeah we on a different path

[Hook]
Ice on froze, head on freeze
Still sippin' on fours
Lemonade and speed
Baseball bat at award ceremonies
New rings on, on new destiny
Money on deck, make the bank call me
Chandelier ice castle, on E
Ice on froze but my head on freeze
Still sippin' on fours
Lemonade and speed

[Verse 2]
Dark night, angels dirty when I need a plan
I pop, with them birdies, been fly like that
2040, me and gang Gotham City land
Wanna find the time, be with you and just hold your hand
Leandoer AKA the crow, flying rats and sand
When I try to be carefree I just end up sad
21, almost 22, missions on the map
Light blue jewelry, 3-6 wrist tan
360 worldwide, put Stockholm on the map
Sometimes nightmares don't just end like that
Love will find us in the end, but I don't really see that
Love will find us in the end, but I don't really need that

[Hook]
Ice on froze, head on freeze
Still sittin' on fours
Lemonade and speed
Baseball bat at award ceremonies
New rings on, on new destiny
Money on deck, make the bank call me
Chandelier ice castle, on E
Ice on froze but my head on freeze
Still sittin' on fours
Lemonade and speed

[Outro]
I crush rock, like they crush your dreams
I crush you if you come between me and the gang
I get green cash like the grinch
Walk out of hell, all fresh like mint
