[Intro: Sample]
PROFOUND SADNESS

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Shawty wanna smoke and you know how that go
GS posted up, bad boys with bank rolls
All this THC make my  eyes fall low
I be riding in the snow, iced out, stacking dough
Shawty, shawty wanna smoke and you know how that go
When I'm in your town they salute me where I go
I got, I got all this weed in my pockets, bank notes
Got my, got my crew with me, in your town, yellow smoke

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Ice visionaries, nothing's really necessary
No one is above me, I'm so high that it's scary
Burning leaves, Fred Perry
On a boat, I'm on a ferry
My boys draped up in Burberry
All I need is what I carry
Hit the blunt, smoking skunk
I don't really have to stunt
I don't talk, I just walk
To get everything I want
Hundred thousand, we don't call
Let 'em know we flex it all
I got dro, my wrist roll
It's so light, don't want it dark
Keep this shit low key, I be smoking OG
I be with my friends, cause these other boys don't know me
Keep this shit low key, I be blowing OG
I be with my team, SBE, Lean

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Shawty wanna smoke and you know how that go
GS posted up, bad boys with bank rolls
All this THC make my  eyes fall low
I be riding in the snow, iced out, stacking dough
Shawty, shawty wanna smoke and you know how that go
When I'm in your town they salute me where I go
I got, I got all this weed in my pockets, bank notes
Got my, got my crew with me, in your town, yellow smoke

[Verse 2: Ballout]
Shawty wanna glo so you know how that go
I be smoking weed, girl you know how I blow
I be walking in the mall spending nothing but bank rolls
And every time you see me I got a different bank roll
I don't fuck with no niggas, if the niggas ain't with GLO
GBE and Sadboys, you know how it glow
Got a team full of bad bitches at the condo
I'm smoking weed and leaning, I don't want no convo
