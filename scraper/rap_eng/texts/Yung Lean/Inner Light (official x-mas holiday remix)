[Verse 1: Thaiboy Digital]
Tryna flex ? but they bout that life
Baby say she like me she know bout that life
Take her on vacation she know we about that life
Take her on vacation she know we about that

Flying on my private jet over island (island)
I need to take some time off, vacation
Bring my baby girl on vacation
Catch me on this island when the lights out

Moonlight in the sky I been chillin with my baby girl
She know she the one I love
She the only one I love
Next year thaiboy 21st
Eleven october that’s my birthday
Thaiboy

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
On a mission in the mountains
See me drinking rum straight off the fountain
See me thaiboy
Thaiboy
Hear me
?
Ah ah Ah ah
Snow white
Coke white
All white everything
A range rover
Two cups I can't feel anything
Im in the club I’m sipping drinks
I’m rolling off a pearly pill
Rolling off a pearly blunt
They Tryna get up early son
Later
Tryna take my cash but you know that I ?
So much love for my day ones
Segway rolling thirty blunt
Can’t get help from thirty nuns
She pop two while im on one
Lately lean lean well I’m so gone
On a mission in the mountains
See me drinking rum straight off the fountain
See me thaiboy
Thaiboy
Hear me ?
Ah ah ah

[Verse 3: JJ]
Leaving how this song goes
Leading all these yung boys
Running fast smoking with a sore throat
Drinking, doing pure coke
Inner light
In this club
I wanna make love in this club
So I make love in this club
Real sad girls can’t feel gravity
I’m no star I’m the fucking sunlight!
