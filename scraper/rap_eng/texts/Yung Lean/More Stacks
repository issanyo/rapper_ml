[Hook]
Shawty, roll up, I'm a smoker
We will fly high they below us
Bitch, Im runnin' on the road to the money bus
My wings fold up, smokin' winter lungs
My boys roll up, rollin' honey buns
I got pills look like rainbows in my tour bus
More cash, more stacks and there's more for us
Money foreign in my pocket and it's for us

[Verse]
I got bands in my Louis bags, bags under my eyes
Lean up in the club I'm smoking wind and gettin fried
Fuck these other guys Imma do this till I die
Pink polo dirty stacks 24/7, 9-5
I need a new ring and i need another pill
Still in Yoshi City rollin rollin down a hill
I need a new high and I need a new life
I need a hundred million roses on me when I die

[Hook]
Shawty, roll up, I'm a smoker
We will fly high they below us
Bitch, Im runnin' on the road to the money bus
My wings fold up, smokin' winter lungs
My boys roll up, rollin' honey buns
I got pills look like rainbows in my tour bus
More cash, more stacks and there's more for us
Money foreign in my pocket and it's for us

[Bridge]
For us, for us
More stacks for us

[Hook]
Shawty, roll up, I'm a smoker
We will fly high they below us
Bitch, Im runnin' on the road to the money bus
My wings fold up, smokin' winter lungs
My boys roll up, rollin' honey buns
I got pills look like rainbows in my tour bus
More cash, more stacks and there's more for us
Money foreign in my pocket and it's for us

[Bridge]
For us, for us
More stacks for us
