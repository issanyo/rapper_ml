[Intro]
If I die

[Hook]
Shine, all I do is outshine
I can't go outside, I do this for my life
Fluorescent lights, I need a bitch by my side
All my brothers gone' rise All I do is outshine
Blood blood on the moonlight

[Verse]
Let me live I'm alive
No feelings left in the night
White powders sprinkle my sprite
I stay up and I work all night
I flipped a couple of cows
You know I don't play both sides
Let me come inside
No moon only a space station
I felt my face melt
I left my chain stealth
I'm just like Rainman
My money raining
I'm feeling sacred
Diamonds my bracelet
Shawty needs face lift
You know I'd take it
Would always chase it
My heart could never break it
My cuffs kept breaking
I'm not even gonna say shit
I don't like conversations
I feel my face melt
No moon only a space station
Lend me a light

[Hook]
Shine, all I do is outshine
I can't go outside, I do this for my life
Fluorescent lights, I need a bitch by my side
All my brothers gone' rise, gone' rise, gone' rise

[Hook 2]
Let me in I'm alive
Let me in I'm alive
All my brothers gone rise
The feelings left in the night in the night in the night oh oh
I'll try
All I do is outshine
You know I can't go outside
I do this for my life my life my life
I see fluorescent lights
I need a bitch by my side
All my brothers gone rise
Blood on the moonlight
Let me in I'm alive
Let me in I'm alive
Let me in I'm alive
You know I can't go outside outside outside
I'll promise I'll try
I need a bitch by my side
Know what I do is shine
I do this for my life my life my life
