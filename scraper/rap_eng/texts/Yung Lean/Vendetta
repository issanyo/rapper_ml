[Intro]
I'm on

[Hook]
Chopper vendetta, I'm on
Fucked up the whole game
Leandoer shawty, got 'em drugs in a hallway
Stars on my face, I'm letting go of my old ways
Chopper vendetta
I'm blown she want my whole brain

[Verse 1]
Fendi bags up on my back I'm stackin till the whole roof falls
Italian drug deals 1k euro for my wine and snow
Standin' with my brothers on a roof I think I see the storm
Woke up in the  store with my boobie like i have it all
Stars upon my neck I'm sipping bourbon
Dropped out of school cause i was workin'
When they see me they all scream my surname (Leandoer)
They living out a suit case for the curren (Currency)

[Hook]
Chopper vendetta, I'm on
Fucked up the whole game
Leandoer shawty, got 'em drugs in the hallway
Stars on my face I'm letting go of my old ways
Chopper vendetta
I'm blown she want my whole brain

[Bridge]
They all wanna throw (They all wanna throw)
Shade on me cause I blow (Shade on me cause I blow)
They all wanna know (They all wanna know)
How I pull up in a Rolls (How I pull up in a Rolls)

[Verse 2]
I've been falling down and climbing up
60 on a foreign drug
Our boys ain't workin out a luck
Four-wheelers in a desert, yup
Truck foreign, hoe like a spider up and then I crowling
Ridin' around with [stacks] on me, spikes on my Rembrandt carpet
Texas chainsaw on me baby frightening
Don't need no flash, all my jewelry lightning
And I'm startin' champagne on an island
I'm just trying to fade away burn up like titans
Lean

[Hook]
Chopper vendetta I'm on
Fucked up the whole game
Leandoer shawty, got 'em drugs in the hallway
Stars on my face I'm letting go of my old ways
Chopper vendetta
