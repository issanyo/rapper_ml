[Intro]
(Hurt what it do?)
(Hurtboy)
Man oh man, you should see all the kinds of friends we got looking after us

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Five x pills bitch, I'm fucked out my mind
Orange and purple, green pills and lines
Put the knife to your mouth like the Joker, make you smile
Frozen city, Frozen Lord, I'ma change the time
All my boys some goblins, snorting blow to unwind
Pour up a four, then I'm back on my grind
Change whether I tell ya
My brother got 'em drugs, he a drug seller

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Got on Margielas (Maisons)
Blood-red love letters (Leandoer)
Leandoer do it better
Like a rat got some cheddar

[Bridge: Thaiboy Digital]
Lean on the phone said Thaiboy bro it's the time
So I cross two ocean now I'm higher than high bro
Two blunts up now I can't stop
Two white SUV riding round the club

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Five x pills bitch, I'm fucked out my mind
Orange and purple, green pills and lines
Put the knife to your mouth like the Joker, make you smile
Frozen city, Frozen Lord, I'ma change the time
All my boys some goblins, snorting blow to unwind
Pour up a four, then I'm back on my grind
Change whether I tell ya
My brother got 'em drugs, he a drug seller

[Bridge: Thaiboy Digital]
Lean on the phone said Thaiboy bro it's the time
So I cross two ocean now I'm higher than high bro
Two blunts up now I can't stop
Two white SUV riding round the clock

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
Hundred thousand on the floor, cocaine on the couch
Stuffed the dead king cobra in my leather pouch
Thaiboy Goon with me, rolling weed on leather couch
Scarecrow gang coming through make you say "ouch!"
Hit the top, flip the rocks
Getting top, I can't stop
I'ma go untill it starts
Sipping Willy Wonka, we call the drop
Keep the cocaine in my sock, Margiela flip flops
Wanted to fuck Kate Bush
On the loft, you recruit the soft

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Five x pills bitch, I'm fucked out my mind
Orange and purple, green pills and lines
Put the knife to your mouth like the Joker, make you smile
Frozen city, Frozen Lord, Imma change the time
All my boys some goblins, snorting blow to unwind
Pour up a four, then I'm back on my grind
Change whether I tell ya
My brother got 'em drugs, he a drug seller
