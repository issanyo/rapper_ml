[Verse 1]
I got lots of swag and I be feelin' hurt
Walk up in the bank like John Dillinger
Rainbows, I'm willin' to splurge
After you've gone I'm still on the Earth
No, no, no you can't get my bank roll
Slow, slow, slow this cup got me slow
Low, low, low shawty bring it to the floor (get low)
Oh, oh, oh SBE in this bitch got more (Sad Boys)

[Hook]
Ski mask, shawty, girl, whatever you like (you like)
Moncler jackets dirty cash plenty flights (flights)
Cocaine clean but my jeans really dirty
I just copped some silver rings and they go about Thirty
Ski mask, shawty I pull up with the team (pull up, pull up)
Ski mask, shawty I still see you in my dreams (Lean!)
Dirty fanta shawty, bitch, I'll never leave (l'll never leave)
Dirty fanta shawty, bitch, I'll never leave (Scrr, scrr)

[Verse 2]
Flow, flow, flow on the floor, floor, floor
Percs, percs, percs, got me out of control
Iced-out on the floor rubber bands can't even fold
Girls all in my phone ho ho Santa Clause
Ski mask shawty, prayin' down to my knees
Louis Sprite Gang shawty all over me
Check out my waist and check out my sleeves
When I ride around I keep my stacks on my feet
Ski mask shawty keep the racks for the team
Ten toes down in my head I'm not clean
Reality for me I don't see it like you see
Broken Piano, pockets stuffed with magic beans
Walk up in the club, I got like fifty birds (Walk up, Walk up)
Need this gun on me, I'm still on the search
I got straight hunneds straight drop
Love of my life she gonna set me up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up in the parkin' lot
Bitch, we sellin' wine and I'm breakin' rocks
Just keep goin' I don’t wanna stop
Pull up, pull up in the parkin' lot
Dough, dough, dough, I got dough, dough, dough
More like Bart Simpson in my song, song, song
Clone, clone, clone, you a clone, clone, clone
All so low Imma hop on the road

[Hook]
Ski mask shawty got whatever you like
Moncler jackets dirty cash plenty flights
Cocaine clean but my jeans really dirty
I just copped some silver rings and they go about Thirty
Ski mask, shawty I pull up with the team (pull up, pull up)
Ski mask, shawty I still see you in my dreams (out of control)
Dirty fanta, shawty, bitch, I'll leave
Dirty fanta, shawty, bitch, I'll never leave

[Outro]
Santa clause, Leandoer, Stranger
Shout out Yung Gud, this is Gud my man, you already know
Sixhundred beats, sixhundred days, sixhundred songs
I can’t sleep no more gotta make another hit
Wake up in the mornin' and I make another hit
You know how it going' 'cause life is a bitch
