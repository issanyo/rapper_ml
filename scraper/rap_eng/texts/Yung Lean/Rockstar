[Chorus]
I'm a rockstar, cowboy in the dark
I'm a rockstar, cowboy in the dark
I'm a rockstar, cowboy in the dark
I'm a rockstar (na-na-na)
Cowboy in the dark (Na-na-na-na-na)

[Verse]
If I live now wouldn't change a thing
When you take this is for take my skin
Insects on my skin I won't be back again
It's mine it's mine I see the light at the very end
Lost in paradise I want the snakes crawling
Holding on to you as I keep walking
Looked into an angels eyes I saw her grin
Keep my dogs and send me in a box with them
[?] with this evil twin
I'm chasing my own tail and you lives again
What I do for you I can't describe this
I see lights around me, I see foreign winds
I'ma buy cake for you
I'ma buy cake for you
Married to the money with no wedding ring
I see the sky falling, see ghosts again
I see ravens flying south caught up in the wind
Caught up in the wind
Caught up in the wind

[Chorus]
I'm a rockstar, I'm a cowboy in the dark
I'm a rockstar, cowboy in the dark
I'm a rockstar, cowboy in the dark
I'm a rockstar, cowboy in the dark
