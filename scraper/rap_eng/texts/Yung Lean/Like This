[Hook: Tadoe]
I'm skatin', I'm skatin', I'm forgi skatin'
AMG bands, bitch these ain't no deytons
White girl, white girl, I'm high like Peyton
Bitch, we all champions, I feel like the Patriots
Hatin', hatin', I'm paper chasin'
Nigga tryna rob me, he gettin' face ment
Face it, face it, a hollow replacer
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, a nigga can take 'em

[Verse 1: Ashley All Day]
I don't know yo ass, don't be commin' up to me
Tryna shake my hand and shit, bitch I ain't friendly
Now, please tell me why these bitches mad at me?
Cause they can't just bat they lashes and get everythin' for free
I don't gotta do shit, can't no nigga say they hit
Cause a pic on Instagram, man that don't mean shit
She said, "Newport shawty told me do it like this"
Got that bandanna on, boobs bigger than your fist
Oh, so now you wanna touch your face like this?
Oh, so now you think really you with the shits like this ?
I be hella fuckin' high and I don't remember shit
But she said, "Newport shawty told me do it like this"

[Hook: Tadoe]
I'm skatin', I'm skatin', I'm forgi skatin'
AMG bands, bitch these ain't no deytons
White girl, white girl, I'm high like Peyton
Bitch, we all champions, I feel like the Patriots
Hatin', hatin', I'm paper chasin'
Nigga tryna rob me, he gettin' face ment
Face it, face it, a hollow replacer
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, a nigga can take 'em

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
I go hard for my squad, I've been large in my car
Yoshi Town, we some stars, fuck glowstone, Island Heart
2015 feelin' like it's 03'
Shut your mouth lil bitch, you don't know 'bout me
We go hard, I might just OD
Got soo many stans, Sadboys should've won a gram
Fuck a Grammy hoe, I rather get stupid dough
Feathers on my chest, Ignore me or salute me, hoe
Fuck a Grammy hoe, I rather get stupid dough
Feathers on my chest, Ignore me or salute me, hoe

[Hook: Tadoe]
I'm skatin', I'm skatin', I'm forgi skatin'
AMG bands, bitch these ain't no datings
White girl, white girl, I'm high like Peyton
Bitch, we all champions, I feel like the Patriots
Hatin', hatin', I'm paper chasin'
Nigga tryna rob me, he gettin' face ment
Face it, face it, a hollow replacer
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, a nigga can take 'em

[Verse 3: Ballout]
If you ain't talkin', I on't want no conversation
I've been gettin' paper since the confirmation
On the block, you know I don't do no relations
I stack paper and then spend it later
In my new old school, inside, now I'm later
I got flavor I'm smokin' woods, no paper
Stuff the money in the bag, use the money machine later
Pull up in a NASCAR, ballout Speed Racer

[Hook: Tadoe]
I'm skatin', I'm skatin', I'm forgi skatin'
AMG bands, bitch these ain't no deytons
White girl, white girl, I'm high like Peyton
Bitch, we all champions, I feel like the Patriots
Hatin', hatin', I'm paper chasin'
Nigga tryna rob me, he gettin' face ment
Face it, face it, a hollow replacer
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, a nigga can take 'em
