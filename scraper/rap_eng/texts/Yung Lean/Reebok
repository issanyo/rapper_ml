[Hook: Yung Lean]
Gave your bitch lip lock
Pull up rocking Reebok
My boys with me T'd up
Cheese up, eat up
Rocking neon G shocks
Clean rocks, polo on my green socks
Run up but I read up
Gave your bitch lip lock
Pull up rocking Reebok
My boys with me T'd up
Cheese up, eat up
Rocking neon G shocks
Clean rocks, polo on my green socks
Run up but I re'd up

[Verse 1: Lil Flash]
G-L-O i'll freeze ya
Yeah we'll heat ya
Pull up on your block and beat ya
Treat ya, meet ya
Beat ya with a mop or two
Pull up on you with a Glock or three
Ch-ch-ch-chop at you, who ya fuck you talking to
B's up, C's up and I'm double G'd up
I don't fuck with G's though
Hit em' with the fa-he-cha
Hit his ass with nina
I don't think he want no smoke
Smoke him like a good dope
Pack of that strong-strong
Bitch I'm feeling gleechie
Feel like I'm Big Meechie
Tell a bitch give me tee-tee
That I gotta see-see
See where I'm gonna get this green B
These cheese be
Me and Yung Lean pull up with choppers
Blow them at your fee-fee

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
What you need from me brah
Running like a cheetah
My money come meet her
Pack came in a lil cheaper
All my boys smoke reefer
Riding a 2-seater
My drink a lil sweeter
I don’t see no evil
I don’t chase hoes man
Don’t ever want romance
She made my heart frozen
We call up the dope man
We stack up the dough and
Leave you with smoke and
I’m ballin' I’m rollin
I’m ballin' I’m rollin
I done did a whole lot of shit in my life just to get it
Rockin' Burberry I just bought a new Chevy
Riding in that Bentley I’m a ghost but I’m still friendly
Japanese Korean that’s my type she wanna get it
