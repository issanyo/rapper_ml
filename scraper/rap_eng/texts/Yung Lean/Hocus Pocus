[Hook: Yung Lean]
All I roll is potent, we stay golden
We gone hocus pocus, they think they know us
I'm flyin' in a lotus, in a Range Rover
Is my life over?

[Bridge: Yung Lean]
Take, take, take, take
Take control of, take control of me
Take control of Lean, take control of me
All I roll is potent

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
White powder like a hill, take control of me
When it hits my body, you know there's no stoppin' lean
I don't like red, paint the roses green
Put a price up on my head, there's no controllin' me
I thought I was dead, but I'm livin' free
Walk up in the spot, bitch, it's SBE
Stack the money green, turn it into leaves
Six Air Force on my feet look like a centipede

[Hook: Yung Lean]
All I roll is potent, we stay golden
We gone hocus pocus, they think they know us
I'm flyin' in a Lotus, in a Range Rover
Is my life over? Is, is it over?

[Verse 2: Yung Lean & Bladee]
Never will I rise to fall, I've seen that light from very far
I pack my bag, I pack my bag, bet you could never match the stars
Keep my boys 'round, they watch my back
Follow the lights, we in the cab
Hash is from uzbekistan, I ball like asics 'cross the land
You see my face, I see your hands
She don't want to understand, but I have a plan
Mixing alcohol and xans, when I'm with my gang
You can find me where I stand, Disney wonderland
I don't ever get attached, doesn't work like that
Doesn't work like that
Black bracelet, never show facesTwo pills runnin' round in the matrix
Never show faces, never show faces
Two pills runnin' round in the matrix

[Hook: Yung Lean]
All I roll is potent, we stay golden
We gone hocus pocus, they think they know us
I'm flyin' in a Lotus, in a Range Rover
Is my life over? Is, is it over?
All I roll is potent, we stay golden
We gone hocus pocus, they think they know us
I'm flyin' in a Lotus, in a Range Rover
Is my life over? Is, is it over?
Lotus, Ranger Rover, is, is, it over?

[Outro: Yung Lean]
Take, take, take, take
Take control of, take control of me
Take control of Lean, take control of me
Yeah, it takes control of me
