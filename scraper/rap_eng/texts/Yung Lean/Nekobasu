[Intro:]
(Sausage)
Nekobasu, Iceland, we hangin' down in the Iceland
Nekobasu, Iceland, we hangin' down in the Iceland
Nekobasu, Iceland, we hangin' down in the Iceland
Nekobasu, Iceland, we hangin' down in the Iceland

[Verse 1:]
Glass balls of ice, man, diamond knife hand
Astro-astro-boys Iceland, Sadboys will be missed me
Me and Baba in disguise, man, we consist in that mist
Sinful when the city turns to night-land, crocodile, bucket hat
Check the price, man, check the price, man
Came in ridin', came in with the right hand, we come through
Sad Boys, we don't need you
We bleed tears, we don't see you
We're a velociraptor, we don't feed fools
We eat you, like seafood
Sushi and that  tofu, Sprite and wine for my whole crew

[Hook:]
Shawty, you with Lean
Shawty, you wanna come with me?
Shawty-shawty, you with Lean
Shawty, you wanna come with me?
G-g-galaxy torn away
Bitch, I'm in the fuckin' shade
Up in the clouds, cause I'm finna get faded
Galaxy torn away, bitch, I'm in the fucking shade
Up in the clouds, cause I'm finna get faded

[Verse 2:]
I stack this money, Northface everyday
Getting stacks, getting paid
Living good, drop top the Chevrolet
Fruit Loops and them Pop Rocks
Got the Coco Pops and the crack rocks
Grease chick up in Bangkok
I've been every where
Yung Lean don't even care
I've been everywhere
Yung Lean don't even care
All them shit shades
Ten chains, six million Olimpic gold rings
I'm the big boss, strange player
BBC shirts in every layer
In every layer

[Verse 1:]
Glass balls of ice, man, diamond knife hand
Astro-astro-boys Iceland, Sadboys will be missed me
Me and Baba in disguise, man, we consist in that mist
Sinful when the city turns to night-land, crocodile, bucket hat
Check the price, man, check the price, man
