[Verse]
Eternal life
Make my city proud
Fuck everyone, king without a crown
Lean up in the whip, yeah turn it up
Just got a check, might burn it up
Lost at life, I don't boost up
All this time flies away in my coffee cup
I like being alone, shut the fuck up
Sad Alliance ballin' out in Europe
I got Gucci, Louis, APC gear on
Live in Winterland, but I'm iced up

[Hook]
See me blowing ice cold smoke, finna' roll up
See me blowing ice cold smoke, finna' roll up
See me flying high, I got no love
Pull up to the spot with my Range Rover
See me flying high, I got no love
Pull up to the spot with my Rover

[Outro]
Eternal life
Make my city proud
Fuck everyone, king without a crown
Lean up in the whip, yeah turn it up
Just got a check, might burn it all
