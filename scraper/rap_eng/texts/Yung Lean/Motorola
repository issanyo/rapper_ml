[Chorus]
Gold on my wrist, phone in my pocket
Gold on my wrist, phone in my pocket
Gold on my wrist, phone in my pocket
Phone in my pocket
Gold on my wrist, phone in my pocket
Gold on my wrist, phone in my pocket
Gold on my wrist, phone in my pocket
Phone in my pocket

[Verse]
Alien face, tatted up
Ballin', ballin', Swiss cup
'Dro cologne and I'm drunk
'Dro cologne and I'm drunk
Pounds of Gucci on me, Gucci shoes on my feet
I wanna see who you sleep, I wanna see who you sleep
Sad mob, money Lean
Sad gang, that's money team
I look down, down to Earth
See my reflection, what's it worth?
Alien face, tatted up.
Ballin', ballin', Swiss cup
'Dro cologne and I'm drunk
'Dro cologne and I'm drunk

[Chorus]
Gold on my wrist, phone in my pocket
Gold on my wrist, phone in my pocket
Gold on my wrist, phone in my pocket
Phone in my pocket
Gold on my wrist, phone in my pocket
Gold on my wrist, phone in my pocket
Gold on my wrist, phone in my pocket
Phone in my pocket
