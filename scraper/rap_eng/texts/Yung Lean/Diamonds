[Hook: Yung Lean]
Got diamonds on my bank account
They know where I come from
When I walk in they think Leany is a problem
Drop it on the low, make that thing go back
Everything is slow, where I sleep I got a stack

[Post Hook: Yung Lean]
I be in a dream, where the, where the fiends at
I be in a dream, where's my, where's my sleep at
It’s a graveyard town, all I do is walk around
I'll be, I'll be in Yoshi City, nowhere to be found

I got diamonds on my bank account

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Bitch I'm smoked out, I be seeing five elements
My spaceship all white, chains looking like an elephant's
Cruising all night, everybody be smelling it
What you want tonight? Ain't no goddamn telling them
Yeah I'm the boss bitch, I'm the fucking Reverend
Take a trip to Paris, I be back again
Take a trip to Yoshi City, never come back again, tell a friend
Leany been addied like a goddamn veteran
If I'm in the club, then they smelling them
Bitch I'm in the shadows, I'm the captain
Me and my boys stacking Benjamins, we be stacking Benjamins
Tell a friend, diamonds on my bankac-

[Verse 2: Thaiboy Digital]
Took off across the globe, now I'm in Sweden
Want to be needed, I don't need them
Want to stay flexing through the seasons
Want to be king of this region
Thaiboy, Thaiboy you know I was born for a reason
For a safer world, fuck a treason
Diamond, diamond for my girl, she's the reason
She's like an angel, I'm a demon
Gucci polo on my waist, I got racks on me
Young Thaiboy Goon, you know forever GTB
Baby what you really need, treasure full of weed
Came up outta nothing, had to succeed
Baby let me know when you catching feelings
Baby let me know when you catching feels (Thaiboy)
Baby what you really need, treasure full of weed
Came up outta nothing, had to succeed
