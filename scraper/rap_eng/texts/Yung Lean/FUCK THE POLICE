[Intro: Yung Lean]
Lean, Lean
Leandoer
Ballout, Leandoer
Fuck the police

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Fuck the police
Try to stay strong but feeling weak
I don't know why she betrayed me
I'm screaming fuck the world, I'm alone in the streets
I lost in this world, I lost in this world
I lost in this world, I pour up a four
I'm lost in this world, I'm ridin' in the snow
I don't give a fuck, locals call me Cholo

[Verse 2: Ballout]
I'm a street nigga
Gettin' street money
R.I.P Bankroll
I wake up, hit the bank
Hit them all to their bitch clothes
Marshay, Cartier
My frame game gang so crazy
I go so fucking crazy
Pull up hoes getting crazy
Hoppin' out foreigns
Me and gang, me and lean
My brain on codeine
14 grams in the cone mane
20k in my balmains, man
I got the chopper, free BG
Glo Gang run the city
Choppa Boys in the city

[Verse 3: Yung Lean]
I'm 19, I got diamonds all up on me, hoe
Yellow hair, yellow Rari, I be counting dough
Just like Homer Simpson, I got dough all on my boat
Ridin' in a Hummer, bending corners and I'm movin' slow
Try to fuck with Lil Leany's money that's a big no no
I just bought some roses Givenchy, swear to god these girls Fucking anybody, anybody
Me and Ballout we just pulled up on anybody, let's go!

[Outro: Yung Lean]
