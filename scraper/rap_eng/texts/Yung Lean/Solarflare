Sadboys, emotional boys
Bitch we live in a UFO
Sky's pink when I'm on ecstasy in Tokyo

[Verse 1]
Molecules expand, molecules exist
I'm a molecule but I stand in the mist
Molecules expand, molecules exist
I'm a molecule but I stand in the mist
Bitch don't cut your wrists, I'mma kill to live
The molecule that's me won't go without a fist
I'm a molecule but I stand in the mist
Bitch don't cut your wrists, I'mma kill to live

[Hook]
Solar flare, I can see the skies circling, I'm almost there
Solar flare, I can see the skies circling, I'm almost there
Solar flare, I can see the skies circling, I'm almost there
Solar flare, I can see the skies circling, I'm almost there

Posted in that Death Star, snorting coke with Darth Vader
Posted up, dressed in Bapesta
All that shit she did, yeah I made her
It’s been awhile since slept alone
I guess I'll see you later
When I catch her in another world I'mma realize why I hate her
Posted up, dressed in bapester
I'mma play her, I'mma rob her, I'mma fuck her with no rubber
I'mma play her, I'mma rob her, I'mma fuck her with no rubber

Solar flare, I can see the skies circling, I'm almost there
Solar flare, I can see the skies circling, I'm almost there
