[Refrain: Yung Lean]
Bitches on my dick cause I'm so luxurious
Light Saber in one hand, I can be your saviour
Bitches on my dick cause I'm so luxurious
Light Saber in one hand, I can be your saviour

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Optimus Prime
Do her from behind
Police knocking on my door I've done my time
Wake me up at 7 just to fuck with my grind
I'm grinding grinding
Sad boys they be shining shining
Focus on whining whining
When the neon lightning strikes and then I'm on the floor crying, crying

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Why do I gotta be alive
I ain't about that life I ain't bout that life
Fuck all of y'all no one can tell me shit
I'm with my team I'm so high please get up off my dick
I love nature and everything around me
But when an eye press into find me
I'm on the floor crying, crying
Sad boys says that I'm dying, dying

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Optimus Prime
Do her from behind
Police knocking on my door I've done my time
Wake me up at 7 just to fuck with my grind
I'm grinding grinding
Sad boys they be shining shining
Focus on whining whining
When the neon lightning strikes and then I'm on the floor crying, crying

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
Rocks got me chipping
Pussy starts a-dripping
I might just have to slip in
Grey Goose sipping
Pink skies got me tripping
Never catch me slippin', never catch me slippin'
High-tec polo gear sipping
Up that Jack when I'm in Narashino flipping
Sushi bars after bars catch me whipping
Up that ho while she dripping
Glock in my Gucci belt got you equipping
Anime shawtys be stripping
I get paid by the bars but you never catch me slipping
No you never get me slipping

[Refrain: Yung Lean]
Bitches on my dick cause I'm so luxurious
Light Saber in one hand, I can be your saviour
Bitches on my dick cause I'm so luxurious
Light Saber in one hand, I can be your saviour

Optimus Prime
Do her from behind
Police knocking on my door I've done my time
Wake me up at 7 just to fuck with my grind
I'm grinding grinding

[Refrain: Yung Lean]
Bitches on my dick cause I'm so luxurious
Light Saber in one hand, I can be your saviour
Bitches on my dick cause I'm so luxurious

Police knocking on my door I've done my time
Wake me up at 7 just to fuck with my grind

[Outro: Sample]
I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like tears in rain... Time to die
