[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
I'm rolling in an SUV
All this money, I count it on me
Count it like a count machine
Rolling up a blunt laced up in codeine
I'm rolling off a magic Harry Potter bean
The shawty on my side, she looking out for me
Smelling like dope on my drivers seat
Hop off bitches taking pics of Thaiboy and Yung Lean
Dirt bike bitches, yeah I'm on a roll
I see evil spirits like shadows where I go
I be with all my bros
We just took three laps all around the globe
My boy said he don't wanna live no more

[Hook: Yung Lean x2]
We grinding hard, dope razor blade on my chest
Getting dough, smoking dope, I think I am obsessed
My future's looking brighter than my urine test
S-A-D-B-O-Y-S

[Verse 2: Thaiboy Digital]
Finna, finna feed my world
Finna switch it up, this is not enough
Man, they done fucked up
Man, Thaiboy all off a cup
I be rolling in like I'm foreign
Yung Thaiboy, you know that I'm fucking foreign
I'm with Leany and we touring
Man, my Nike shoes cost a fortune
I had to hold on for a second
So you can catch me when I flex
All you niggas make no sense
And yeah I don't make no sense

[Hook x2]
