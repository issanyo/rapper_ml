[Verse 1: Bladee]
I'm ending, everything is Fendi
I'm like water, but these girls are like gremlins
Feel empty, My clip feel empty
But I will go anywhere God sends me
Rose water in my face, I'm an angel
10k on my arms and my labels
I can't look back at a stranger
I cannot love an unfaithful

[Hook: Bladee]
I don't recognize your face, but you recognize my name
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
I don't recognize your face, but you recognize my name
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
My heart is like a highway
Lamborghini fourteen on the driveway
Die if you violate

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
See me smokin' loud, finna leave this earth
I'm in a new dimension like a rebirth
Getting to this money, tell me what's it worth
See me smokin' loud, finna leave this earth
2k, 3k, never seen light of the day, for 4k, 5k
Just made a fortune on ebay
Leanin' can't see straight
Can't remember shit from yesterday
Standing over a cliff off a waterway
Your bitch got my shit on replay
See my face in your display
All this shit sounds clich√©
See my face in your display
Follow me like Norway
I get high, I fly away
Hangin out the window from a Chevrolet
Reality's still far away
Still far away, Still far away

[Hook: Bladee]
I don't recognize your face, but you recognize my name
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
My heart is like a highway
Lamborghini fourteen on the driveway
Die if you violate
I don't recognize your face, but you recognize my name
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
I don't recognize your face, but you recognize my name
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
My heart is like a highway
Lamborghini fourteen on the driveway
Die if you violate
I don't recognize your face, but you recognize my name
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
I don't recognize your face, but you recognize my name
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
My heart is like a highway
Lamborghini fourteen on the driveway
Die if you violate
I don't recognize your face, but you recognize my name
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
