[Intro]
Leandoer, Sadboys
Never
Sadboys

[Chorus]
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Intrigued by the moment, look like she know why
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Ice on my feet, I keep slippin' (Slippin' away)
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Intrigued by the moment, look like she know why
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Ice on my feet, I keep slippin' (Slippin' away)

[Verse 1]
Soldiers in the night and we lurkin'
Medieval flowers in my church, we workin'
I'm in the bottomless pit, Silver Surfer surfin'
I lived a thousand lives, but I'm still searchin' (Where they at?)
Broken glass in my hands, sister's twerkin'
Money on the floor and she nervous
Paint a picture like Van Gogh, I'm cursed man
Skrrt skrrt to the moon, bitch, I'm swervin' (Skrrt)
Hit the curve and my shit broke bitch hurtin'
I was down, so deep down but time's turnin' (Darkness on my)
Darkness in my mind, flip the mattress, I got dough
Harvest on my line, I live the story I was told (Told)

[Chorus]
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Intrigued by the moment, look like she know why
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Ice on my feet, I keep slippin' (Slippin' away)
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Intrigued by the moment, look like she know why
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Ice on my feet, I keep slippin' (Slippin' away)

[Verse 2]
I heard shooters on the roof, yeah they tryna shoot ya
I'm in a dark room, candles singin' hallelujah
You think I'm gone too much, well, I think I suit you
You say I'm in my mind too much, well, I know that suits you
I lost everything, only thing I'm scared is to lose you
I heard voices in my head, yeah, they whispered to us
Paranoid, sledgehammer, that's my Ruger
Woke up, realized I had to move up
Worked my soul away everyday, now my loot up
But the truth is, I wish I never knew us
God of violence, pink dreams in my two cup
I've told you this was gonna end, but I fooled you

[Chorus]
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Intrigued by the moment, look like she know why
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Ice on my feet, I keep slippin'
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Intrigued by the moment, look like she know why
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Ice on my feet, I keep slippin'

[Bridge]
Feels like I'm walkin' on water, not wine
Cut off my fingers to touch your smile
Feels like I'm walkin' on water, not wine
Cut off my fingers to touch your smile

[Chorus]
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Intrigued by the moment, look like she know why
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Ice on my feet, I keep slippin' (Slippin' away)
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Intrigued by the moment, look like she know why
Ice droppin', red bottom sky
Ice on my feet, I keep slippin'
