[Hook x2: Lido]
Shawty what you sippin on, Gatorade
Shawty what you smoking on, lemonade
Im up in the sky finna elevate
Mix it with some koolaid
Popping pills cuz I get paid

[Verse 1: Wil$on]
Uh, I got a pint but I dont wanna slow down, I need something that'll make time slow up
Im hearing people excited wil$on is in town, got me thinking that it might just go up
Ain't no muddy in my strawberry soda
But my gatorade kick like cola
This gin all in my cup
Make a celibate bitch say she wanna fuck
Please dont get knocked up
Cuz thats just my luck
Fuck around and key my shit like Exes do
Her nigga poe 4's like dudes from Texas do
Maybe one day i'll blow like Exile and Blu
Grow my hair real long wear it out like Que
Shawty what you sippin' on?
I ain't a gangsta girl I ain't a Corleone
I just wanna dip in ya' Sierra Leone
If you ain't in to that than trust me I'll be gone
I'll be gone, I'll be out
Wanna be a CEO on my Steve Stout
Smoking on fresh green like when leaves sprout
Feed on Hate telling niggas to please doubt
Mix the liquor with the penicillin
Pray I dont die Pusha T 'Lord Willin'
Gotta pinch myself to restore the feelin'
Can't wait for the day ya' boy touch a billion
Gotta get paid
All these fuck niggas trynna get laid
All these bright lights man im finna get dazed
Trynna have my feet up chilling in the shade

[Verse 2: Lido]
Galaxy boys
Reality is far away
Liquid love got me floatin' away
Up in the club, Grey Goose every day
Stacks on racks 'til my mind starts melting away
Smoking that jay
Posted in the bay
SADBOYS sippin' Arizona day by day
Day by day,I goes away
Swerving swerving on this iced tea
Yung Gud Shorty posted with that DMT
Hash in the pipe is ABC
Cut their wrists and lay 'em down gently
Leopard colored backseat in my Bentley
Relently I pop two pills too many
I don't give a fuck

[Verse 3: Wil$on]
Bout nothin' nobody gotta say
If imma make it in this rap shit its gone be my way
Yall washed up with them struggle bars nigga this to me is just childs play
Give a toast to this bad guy so I guess this is my 'Runaway'
Leaning off of them Zanny bars
Dosing off I need an Adderall
Dont come at me acting friendly nigga I dont fuck with none of yall
Its in my court so I gotta ball
Its on my field so I gotta win
Wil$on off of that Gatorade man this shit sound like the perfect blend
Nigga, I was, Born in 93'
Made in 93'
Without my pops became a man amazingly
Seen niggas get big, like whats stopping me
I created my own path
Only nigga quit school cuz he hate math
Now I count views visualize sales
Go so hard so I can't fail
Im finna get to these dreams
Get faded with the Yung Leans
Get Paid off 16's
Answer niggas prayers like the Sistine
WIL$ON
