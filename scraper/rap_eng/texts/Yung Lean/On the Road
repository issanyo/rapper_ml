[Hook]
I know what it feels like
I know what I know now
I know what it feels like
I know what I know now

[Verse 1]
I know what I know now
I redeem myself
Don't need no one else
Highway nightmares
Angels calling on the road
It's a city made of crystals
Blood on the Toyota
I left heaven for you
Picture me dead

[Hook]
I know what it feels like
I know what I know now
I know what it feels like
I know what I know now

[Verse 2]
On the road again
Highway nightmares
On the road again
It's a city made of crystals
Blood on the Toyota
I left heaven for you
You're all I think about
You're all I think about, girl
You're all I need now
