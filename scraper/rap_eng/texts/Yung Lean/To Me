No, no, I do not  listen, no

Shawty ride with me
We can fuck in two seats
Is you tryin' to get and stack broccoli
Can you fuck with that nigga?

Is you tryin' to get this money?
Tryin' to stack this broccoli
Can you, why you, why you, why you, why you, why you lie to me?
Can we just get this money
Kick it in a two-seat

Talking tryin' to get three-peats
Talking Jordan type shit, Iâ€™m trying six rings on the beats

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
If you play her on this bitch, we don't take easy on that
I'm a motherfucking dog, when it comes to getting stacks
Bitch, I'm still alive so I be with my meds
I be rollin' in that beamer, I got peach colored stacks
They can't stand a lean man, I got Chanel on my hands
Imaginary land, cruising 'round on streets, man
I see meds flying 'round room, I was painting with a broom
Ice cold water meeting shrooms. Baby, what you wanna do?
I got six girls in my room, I got six ghosts like tattoos
Pluto on my neck when I come through, blue hair pink sky thinking 'bout you
Do you still think about me?
Do you still think about Lean? 'bout Lean?
Leandoer!
