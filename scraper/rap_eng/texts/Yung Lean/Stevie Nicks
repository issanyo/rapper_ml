Listening to my favourite 80s cut
Like Stevie Nicks doing cocaine up her butt
Listening to my favourite 80s cut
Like Stevie Nicks doing cocaine up her butt

[Verse 1]
Sent to Earth to prevent the birth
Of the search of Yung Lean AKA the new Big Lurch
Fucking hoes heads like I’m Papa Smurf
I'm on the ocean perch I'm finna break it up on y'all in church
I'm so high I'm posted up I'm finna leave Earth
See me posted on my back porch
Catch me posted in my black Porsche
Roll up a blunt and light it with a torch
Small talk and I do it worse and I stay bored
And I'm Leandoer

[Verse 2]
That lean's got me swerving, Yung Lean's got you serving hits
Right up on the table like Thanksgiving turkey and gravy
See it as for certain born dead after serving females legs in my shed during classes
Asses I be observin'
Swervin' on this lean
Bitches got fire curving
Lacing ginger like curling, I’m just serving
Black magic bitch, call me Merlin
Sexual relations in the early getting paid pounds sterling
I'm following the same certain whirling
I'm getting 8 pounds sterling
I'm following the same certain whirling
Getting 8 pounds sterling

[Verse 3]
Put the key in and open the door, find Leandoer
Put the key in and open the door, find Leandoer
Looking in the orgy like voyeur
Fuck Jack and the beanstalk, I'm climbing up on this great wall
It's all white like Snow White
If the coke's right then I don't need to fight
If the coke's right then I don't need to fight
If the coke's right then I don't need to fight
