[Hook:]
I'm the angel of darkness
I leave you dead and unconscious
I hide myself, I'm regardless
If you say friends in my pocket
I'm smoking loud like a rocket
I said fuck all these other artists
I wake up and I start shit
I'm by myself in this starship
All you other rappers are garbage
Leandoer flow so retarded
My soul is a hostage
This is a preview of everything

[Verse 1:]
I turn nothing to everything
I time travel, I’m aging again
I’m aiming at life and
I'm here when it's right
I turn the clouds into lightning
I guess I'm not good at lying
I said blaze in the shades when I’m writing
Everything you want is what I’m buying
Fuck your style you're biting
Everybody know, I’m rising
I’m shining, I’m shining
Lean comes in perfect with the timing
I'm in the forest, I'm hiking
With my boys, drunk driving
Cold heart I'm a Viking
I said fuck rapping, I'm retiring
I didn't ask for calls, fuck replying
Done new fresh funk, so she ricing
Dark side, I’m providing
Dark side, I’m replying

[Bridge:]
Your love is a one in a million
Your love is a one in a million

[Hook:]
I'm the angel of darkness
I leave you dead and unconscious
I hide myself, I'm regardless
If you say friends in my pocket
I'm smoking loud like a rocket
I said fuck all these other artists
I wake up and I start shit
I'm by myself in this starship
All you other rappers are garbage
Leandoer flow so retarded
My soul is a hostage
This is a preview of everything

[Verse 1:]
I turn nothing to everything
I time travel, I’m aging again
I’m aiming at life and
I'm here when it's right
I turn the clouds into lightning
