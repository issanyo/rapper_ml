[Chorus]
I'm addicted to the feeling, I can't get it out
I feel sick into the ceiling, hurt to see my life
I go in for my set, shawty, get it wet
So many fires in my grave, feels like on a jet
So many engines, like my diamonds need a serviette
They didn't let me out for three weeks
Feel like a vet
I'm addicted to the feeling, I can't get it out
I feel sick into the celling, hurt to see my life

[Verse 1]
Woodgrain drippin', finger lickin', polo'd down
Cider sippin', slide the coupe and switch it out
Stockholm city, dungeon with me
We doin' dirt, blowin' smoke
Countin' bands on the low
Smokin earth 'round the globe
With the team from the snow
Doin' dirt, blowin' smoke
Countin' bands on the low
Smokin' earth 'round the globe
With the team from the snow
Draped in fur like a bird
I got gold 'round my toes
Doin' dirt, Gucci skirt
Shawty down where i go
Woodgrain grippin, Henney sippin'
Vodka redbull, eatin' chicken
Say we wicked like the witches
I got love for all my bitches (Lean)
And I got love for all my bitches

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to the feeling, I can't get it out
I feel sick into the celling, hurt to see my life
I go in for my set shawty, get it wet
So many fires in my grave, feels like I'm on a jet
So many engines, like my diamonds need a serviette
They didn't let me out for three weeks
Feel like a vet
They didn't let me out for three weeks
I feel like a vet
I got fire down im burnin running throught my vest

[Verse 2]
Ice, woke, neon diamonds
Get it faster with my guidance
Hell, lose, snow alliance
Love comes first, hate comes silent
No hate, just faith
Live my life through ultra violence
Big gates pearly snakes
Yeah, they sneak up, up behind me, yellow lie
Rhinestone with my team, we won't come lightly, slightly done
She bite it up
Big Hummer big yellow trucks
Falling demon through my guts
Feel my lungs, they givin' up
Yellow lie 'cause yellow ducks
Big alligator catchin' bucks
Gave up on me, dont give a fuck
I come through and slice you up
