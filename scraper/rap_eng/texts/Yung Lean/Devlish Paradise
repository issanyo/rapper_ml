[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Yo girl is my hobby, me and Thaiboy in the lobby
Thousand, a million, I see like a trillion
See my flying high up, I can't feel a thing
Pull up to the club, Polo dripped up, finna win
I got stacks on me, SBE
White leaves, poppin' E
Duffle bag made of Burberry
I be swervin' see, on that Hennessy
In the forest with artillery, you feel me?
I don't give a fuck, I be blowing on loud
Pull up to the club might burn the fucker down
First day of class, fresh sack of Burberry shades, smoking haze for days
If you see me where I stay bitch I gotta walk away
Power up to the top, drop it down, get some more
Bitch I'm headed to the store
World full of thotties, world full of thotties, it's a fucking party
Thaiboy, Lean, Thaiboy

[Verse 2: Thaiboy Digital]
You donâ€™t want beef, man you need to try some asparagus
I can make you fuckin' freefall with no parachute
Young Thaiboy got my shields so strong like an avalanche
You can walk my path, b-b-brokeboy you no appear again
Thaiboy, Thaiboy I rather be nice (Thaiboy I rather be nice)
Fuck you haters you ain't have no life (haters you ain't have no life)
Thaiboy, Thaiboy I rather be nice (Thaiboy I rather be nice)
Fuck you haters you ain't have no life (haters you ain't have no life)
I be in the back where you brought me
Brought me through the back
You wanna have some cash, I'mma give you that

[Bridge: Thaiboy Digital]
Why you trynna tell me what to do, I'm just flexin'
Why you trynna tell me what to do, I'm just flexin'
Why you trynna tell me what to do, I'm just flexin'
Why you trynna tell me what to do, I'm just flexin'
Why you trynna tell me what to do, I'm just flexin'
