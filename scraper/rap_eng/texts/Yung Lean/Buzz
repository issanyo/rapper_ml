[Intro]
A very interesting character is a wealthy land owner. educated in England, very good family. but this man is the business brain and drug overlord of an empire that stretches across the Andes. he's not your ordinary drug dealer

[Hook]
Range Rover take you on an island
Came up stacks and now im wildin'
I love all my boys, I smoke soo much I'm smilin'
Can't leave now, we just started climbin'
Double cup, drug, I'mma start a riot
I've been smokin' all day, but I ain't high yet
I can take you on a jet and make you flyin'
Champagne on lean, bitch you know I'm flyin'

[Verse]
I know what you think, i'm soo psychic
I bring my bitch with me just like a sidekick
Pop white seeds, call her molly
I don't pop molly no more, guess I'm retired
I see the darkness when I walk through the fire
Take me up to the gods where I'm higher
All white buildings, all I hear is sirens
I just rolled a blunt, who got a lighter?
I just rolled a blunt, who got a lighter?
Range Rover, take you on an island
Came up stacks and now im wildin', wildin'
I love all my boys, I smoke soo much I'm smilin'
