[Intro: Bladee]
Drain Gang
Take a knife and drain your life
RIP Bladee, RIP Ripsquadd

[Bridge: Bladee]
You're a joker, I'm the Joker
Dirty cash on the sofa

[Verse 1: Bladee]
You're a joker, I'm the Joker
Should I listen to the devil or the angel on my shoulder
Dirty cash on the sofa
Fendi bags in the hallway when she come over
Dirty sodas
At the hotel Hyatt, ones moving closer
I don't know her
I'ma duck off in the castle till it blow over

[Hook: Yung Lean]
I ain't never tried hard, it's hard for me to try
Cause I ain't like trying, fuck the world come tell me lies
I ain't never tried hard, it's hard for me to try
Cause I ain't like trying, fuck the world come tell me lies

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
Electric fuel like aliens
Mountain glue we taping them
Living like a vacant man, stacks on me they hating that
Electric fields we wait for them
Struggle till I pay for him
Chasing bags is chasing tags
Chasing bags and changing hands
I told you I'm no Satan
Angels keep me sane man
Still with the same clique
Same time, summer time
Long long white nights
The grind don't stop cause the sun shines

[Verse 3: Bladee & Yung Lean]
Yeah you're talking to a stranger
Two pills I'm a raver
Fingers cut on the paper
I'ma help out my neighbor
Always spin a dreidel, even if it's fatal
You're my son, I'm Darth Vader
Don't talk to me ever, Leandoer, Blader
We gon' shoot your shit like lasers
You can hit me on my pager, all we see is paper

[Hook: Yung Lean]
I ain't never tried hard, it's hard for me to try
Cause I ain't like trying, fuck the world come tell me lies
I ain't never tried hard, it's hard for me to try
Cause I ain't like trying, fuck the world come tell me lies
Hard for me to try
Cause I ain't like trying, fuck the world come tell me lies
I ain't never tried hard, it's hard for me to try
Cause I ain't like trying, fuck the world come tell me lies
