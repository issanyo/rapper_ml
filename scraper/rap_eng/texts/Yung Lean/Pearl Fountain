[Hook: Yung Lean]
For my set, I go in
So many places I don't know where I've been
They keep asking me what state I’m in
So many faces I don't know who I met

[Verse 1: Black Kray]
(Ay, ay)
Shining, shining foreign ice
They be crying tears look like foreign ice
She look scared, need that foreign ice
Trapping out the Swedish snow, four nights (Ay, trap, trap)
30 days and 30 nights
Dirty sad tears just like foreign ice
Squirting liquid lean in that foreign ice
Throwing fo's up yelling all aight
In my Honda
Countin' guap with Lean, slow
Hoe's coming over
Smoking on dro'

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Riding 'round on chrome
Don't know what my partner on
Neon lights all I see, I think I'm gone
Ice blood on my face, I'm forever thrown
SBE, we some vampires, Dracula
I'm in an Acura, hoe I think you stack them up
I'm not good with calculus, I need a calculator
Glass elevator, shoes made by alligators
I'm flying in the sky, feel the air
I’m heartless, fire flying everywhere
Let the darkness take my heart
I put my heart on my sleeve
I'm stuck forever I could never leave

[Verse 3: Bladee]
Saddest story ever told
I don't fuck with you I'm always with my bros
Twenty Thousand Sixteen, I need some gold
All this money, all this money make me cold
I said I cared, I really don't
What you want? I'm always switchin' up my phones
Where did I go? You'll never know
Looking for me but I'm buried under snow

[Hook: Yung Lean]
For my set, I go in
So many places I don't know where I've been
They keep asking me what state I’m in
So many faces I don't know who I met
