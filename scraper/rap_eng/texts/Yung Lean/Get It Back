[Intro]
Get it back
Get it back
Get it back

[Hook]
Diamonds on my wrist, give me an ice attack
Pull up to the club, and I'm back
Get it back, get it back
Get it back, get it back
Diamonds on my wrist, give me an ice attack
Tatts on my wrist, neon coloured stacks
Bitch she gave me heart attack, but I'm back, yes I'm back
Yes I'm back
Yes I'm back
Yes I'm back
Yes I'm back

[Verse]
I've been around the globe so many cities, man
I've fucked a girl in every state but I don't give a fuck
I been with my mans, peach coloured grams
Pull up to the club and my ice gave me an ice attack
I be with Bladee, Sherman n em
Pull up with Whitearmorr and we counting blue M&M's
I was out here in Cali
I was with Bally
Pull up in a 'Rari
I don't like the talking
I don't like the talking
All my dogs be barking

[Bridge]
She call me yeah she stalk me
She call me yeah she stalk me
She on me
It's a good day
I just poured a 4 up in my cup
Spent some money then I get it back

[Hook]
Diamonds on my wrist, give me an ice attack
Pull up to the club, and I'm back
Get it back, get it back
Get it back, get it back
Diamonds on my wrist, give me an ice attack
Tatts on my wrist, neon coloured stacks
Bitch she gave me heart attack, but I'm back, yes I'm back
