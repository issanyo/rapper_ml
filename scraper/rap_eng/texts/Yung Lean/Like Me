[Intro]
(Gleesh) "Man oh man, you should see what kind of boof we got here at fosters!"
(Lean) "Racing, going 40 with my shawty in the mist"
(Casino) "Hurt what it do?"

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Racing, going 40 with my shawty in the mist
Talking kind of slowly 'cause of the coke that I just licked
I'm a viking, I'm just striking, lightning up my wrist
It's gets frightening like The Shining, pulled up with two twins
Chance to get money is a chance I never missed
Alligator, casket slayer, my girl like Lil Kim
I got haters, made me paper, fuck 'em, ain't no shit
I'ma take your Gucci layers, fuck it, we gon' win

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
I don't like your girl, but your girl likes me
I don't like the cameras, but the cameras like me
Yeah, I like the insects, eat you up, then I leave
We are not the same, you are not like me
I don't like the water, 'cause I'm swimming too deep
I don't like the violence, but the pain is care free
I don't like your girl, but your girl likes me
Yeah, I like the insects, eat you up, then I leave

[Verse 2: Lil Dude]
Hit you up, then I'm gone, hop up in the whip
AKs and them choppas do you wrong, get your nigga dead
You be on that bullshit, smoking on this [?]
I should've got a wood, bitch
Glock on me with the rubber grip
And they got them hollow tips
Boy you better walk on them eggshells, fool we follow you
Them young niggas, they're not with, they pullin' up and making miracles
He ain't on shit, act up, we dare you
Shots taken, they rip right through you
Bet when the stick pop, it make him boo boo
He in a shitbag, I'm in a new coupe
Still in the hood like chicken noodle soup
Shoot up your block, then we regroup
Do it again, double back crew
I fucked on your bitch, then I bought her some shoes
I was born to win, you was born to lose
My Fendi, my fifties, might go on a cruise
These niggas know how I'm rockin', I maneuver (pow!)

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
I don't like your girl, but your girl likes me
I don't like the cameras, but the cameras like me
Yeah, I like the insects, eat you up, then I leave
We are not the same, you are not like me
I don't like the water, 'cause I'm swimming too deep
I don't like the violence, but the pain is care free
I don't like your girl, but your girl likes me
Yeah, I like the insects, eat you up, then I leave
