[Verse]
Pull up in that Veyron goin' skrt-skrt (skrrt)
Everyday shit fuck what you heard-heard
I'm so high that I'm flyin' like a bird-bird (brrr)
All of that I know is that it's her-her
I, I am surfing on the earth I'm a surfer
Draped in that Gucci scarf my phone going berserk
I don't do no eye contact my vision blurred-blurred
I'm a demon like a fur-fur, they think I'm absurd-surd
But when I enter the galaxy they are li-like word-word
I'm too fucked up, she said when I hurt her
I don't have no feelings left, I don't wanna hurt her
I am surfing on the earth I'm a surfer
Look into the sky and I see myself
I don't wanna fall down, I don't need your help
I just popped a pill I can't control myself
I'm in that forest and my life is like a fairy tale
Diamonds in my veins, I'm sipping ginger ale
Hate in my heart, getting guided by elves
I'm a lion in this shit everyone else is stale (stale, stale)
Smoke still coming out my mouth when I exhale (yeah)
Look into the sky and I see myself
I don't wanna fall down, I don't need your help
Shout out to my enemies, I wish you well
Shout out to my enemies, I wish you well
