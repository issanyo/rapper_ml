[Hook]
I be smoking loud pack
GTB and Sadboys, racks on racks
I be smoking loud pack
GTB and Sadboys, racks on racks

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
H2O in my soul, emotional tears running down my nose
I go ham at every show
We sell out and we smoke the dro
GTB no gravity, wanna be lean
Choppa in my Louis backpack
I'm on TV, I'm in a dream on your movie screen
When you close your eyes I am who you see (lean)
Sad backpack smoking loud pack, ain't no gravity where I stand
Pop pills like tic tacs, like tic tacs

[Hook]
I be smoking loud pack
GTB and Sadboys, racks on racks
I be smoking loud pack
GTB and Sadboys, racks on racks

[Verse 2: Thaiboy Digital]
Roll up in the club with Yung Lean and Sadboys GTB we flexing
We ball, we ball turn a bitch into a fiend
Cause you know I'm reckless
Too turnt, too turnt no air you rely on the kush im breathless
I'mma splurge, imma splurge in the club so gave two chains, in my necklace
Oh my god, I'm fresh I'm fresh
Thaiboy Goon my name
Have you heard about us like keeps this shit, like a hurry
You can call me Bruce Wayne, fuck with me and you will lose man
Sadboys on deck, GTB we with the drugs men
Kush around my city, with the gravity and Lean
Bladeecity make you feel, Yung Lean will make you hurt
Put you in the dirt, turn you to a fiend
Sadboys, GTB and you know we 'bout that team
