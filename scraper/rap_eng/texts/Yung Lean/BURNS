[Intro]

[Verse: Yung Lean]
It goes down to my spine, make me shiver
Shawty she got swag, she got class, she got figure
You know I don't wanna pose for god damn pictures
I got 10 grams and they right up in the swisher
Domestic violence, I am violent, you know I don't hit her
Sippin' big cups, you know I'm no baby sitter
Why you trippin' bitch? Why you trippin'?
I'm Mr Burns so I don't fuck with Mr Smithers
Why you trippin' bitch? Why you trippin'?
I'm Mr Burns so I don't fuck with Mr Smithers
Everyday I wake up and I'm with her
I don't celebrate, man I'm a singer
I like having sex, doing drugs and eating dinner
If you want it then that's fine come and get burned
If you want it then that's fine come and get burned
If you want it then that's fine come and get burned
It goes down to my spine, make me shiver
Shawty she got swag, she got class, she got figure
I don't wanna pose for no god damn pictures
10 grams right up in the swisher
Why you trippin' bitch? Why you trippin?
