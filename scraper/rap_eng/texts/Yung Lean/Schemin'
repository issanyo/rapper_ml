[Hook: Yung Lean]
Water drippin'
They scheming on me trippin'
I'm falling down, down to darkness
Falling down to darkness [x4]

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
SBE GTB that's the alliance
You can hear us from a distance you know it's so loud man
Silver hair in my nightmares, steel science
I be rolling with my team turb if you are flying
Living in my silence, all I hear is silence
All I hear is silence
All I hear is silence

[Verse 2: Uli K]
You're glowing so much, I can barely see your face
It's just your heart that always beats the same
When you're so far away I can't even say your name
I can't see your face just an angel in your place
Leaving me alone, when you turn into a ghost
I can't see you anymore, I couldn't see you like before
I can't see you anymore
I don't care if your looking, I can't look at you
These angels turn red now I can see the truth
But I'm awful at love, been a ghost in your heart
Tryna' be warm but I went up to the snow
In a room full of angels, I'm still burning
They can't help me, they just stand there
In a room full of angels, I'm still burning
They can't help me, they just stand there

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Water drippin'
They scheming on me trippin'
I'm falling down, down to darkness
Falling down to darkness [x4]
