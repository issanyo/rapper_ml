Ever wonder what's been goin’ and goin' there inside ya
When you get all stressed n you feel like there's danger
In a test feeling a bit distressed
Cuz of the pressure, n your fear of failure
Some say some say it’s a response and if that is the case then we're bouta tell ya
Cuz it seems to paralyze ya, so many physiological symptoms
Increased blood circulation, you feel a change in breathing rate
Heart beat starts to race
Pupils dilate
That's how our body behaves
But what about the brain how does that react rapping kinda fast -
So much to say should I slow down with the facts?
Hey should I slow down for the class

Lil'Nikki chill, you better relax
This is only the surface

C-money innit, finna spit it, let's gettit, are you with it
You better adapt cuz I'm taking over this rap
Talk about Selye's model of GAS
Inspired by messing with rats
Stage 1,  it's a fact
Feeling sick to your stomach
Alarm heart beating heart of beating of panic
Stage 2, resist, adrenal co-cortex got it
Glucocorticoids are deployed in the body and and then they’re joined by hormones like adrenaline, digestion suppression
Stage 3 its exhaustion, stressed for some time
Immune systems depleted, body just can’t comply, you've been defeated

Wanna wanna know about it
There’s a theory made by Cannon
Panic when you see a threat n you can't handle it
Knees weak n arms just like B-Rabbit
Wanna fight wanna run called fight or flight
Release hormones super volcanic
Hypothalamus triggers responses in the mind, triggers the response fight or flight
Short term response goes like:
Adrenal medulla lets adrenaline fill ya
The SNS gets your blood pressure high
But In the long term proteins break down, you need energy now, glucose sent all around
Body so focussed stress, your immune systems suppressed
It's kind of a mess ay
