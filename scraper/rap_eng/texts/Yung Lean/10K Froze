[Intro]
Hey D33J

[Verse 1: Bladee]
Blood drip in the snow, tell me where you go
Do you want something from me, I don't even know
Stay low, moving slow, I just brought the coke
I'm sick in my head, off the dirty dope
I stay in the smoke, you breathe through your nose
I clean winter snow, you look like a ghost
Still on dirty coast, tryna overdose
10k in the flames, now I'm fucking froze

[Bridge]
10k in the flames, now I'm fucking froze
10k in the flames, now I'm fucking froze
10k in the flames, now I'm fucking froze

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
(Lean, Lean, Bladeecity)
When [?] a mumble fails, we got magic through the nails
Talking new dawn, divine jewelry is for sale
My jewelry is gon' set me free, cage birds sing for a fee
I look out for my team, I'm a, I'm a family
10k on the subway every day, wake up smell the cake
No hesitate, look me in my face
Trusting me is not a grace (Lean, Leandoer)
I've been trusting you, I hope you don't throw that shit away
I've been trusting you, I hope you don't throw that shit away

[Bridge]
10k in the flames, now I'm fucking froze
10k in the flames, now I'm fucking froze
10k in the flames, now I'm fucking froze

[Verse 3: Killavesi]
(Now I'm fucking froze)
Live my life, in the shade, this just how it goes
Living in the shade, wish I made, wish I made and get a fucking robe
Try again [?]
In my life, nobody is in my home (nobody's in my home)
[?], that's just how she walks

[Outro: Killavesi]
Baby, you're away
Baby, you're away
Baby, you're away
Baby, you're away
Baby, you're away
Baby, you're away
Baby, you're away
