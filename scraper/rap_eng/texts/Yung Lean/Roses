[Hook 1:]
Bitch I'm in the clouds, you can see me broad day
If you call me up I might get in where you stay
St-st-stone island, iced out, ain't no tellin' where I stay
If-if I'm gone tomorrow, I'll let them know it's okay
G-G-Gucci on my pants, I got roses on my grave
T-t-too many voices, I can't hear what they say
It's just me, my team blowin' dreams
Driftin' themes, ain't no scheme
I k-k-keep my boys around, cause I don't want to talk to peeps
See I don't wanna pay for shit and I don't wanna die
Lean get's all his shit for free, cause I gotta survive
I don't wanna pay for shit and I don't wanna die
Lean get's all his shit for free, cause I gotta survive

[Bridge:]
Eurostars around my car, slap the stupid up
Love my squad we all stars, up on Jupiter
Made it far, crossed the bar, make em' stupid rich
I'm like Bart throwing darts, out a spooky bus
You think you go in, but Lean goin' stupider
Imma make 'em loop it up, pax go round like nucleus
See, I don't wanna pay for shit and I don't wanna die
Lean get's all his shit for free cause I gotta survive, bitch
Eurostars around my car, slap the stupid up
Love my squad we all stars, up on Jupiter
Made it far, crossed the bar, make em' stupid rich
I'm like Bart throwing darts, out a spooky bus
You think you go in, but Lean goin' stupider
Imma make 'em loop it up, pax go round like nucleus
See, I don't wanna pay for shit and I don't wanna die
Lean get's all his shit for free cause I gotta survive, bitch

[Verse:]
Candy, everything I see it's painted candy
Lean up in these sheets where I sleep, sippin' brandy
Ban me, all these broke hoes can't stand me
I'm flyin' through outer space, these drugs can't land me
Ban me, get your money up if you're tryna get me (ca$h, ca$h)
All they do is hate, cause they can't understand me
I be pumpin' Smiths in a mansion, you can't be
But you could try to be me
All I see is feelings, but they don't understand me
My family, I got love for them and my fans see
Bitch I'm, bitch I'm, bitch I'm tryna get it like everyday
Press play, day-day-day by day by day, day-day by day still goes away

[Hook 2:]
Bitch I'm in the clouds, you can see me broad day
If you call me up, I might get in where you stay
St-st-stone island, iced out, ain't no tellin' where I stay
Smell the green
I got Louis bags look like coffee
Iced out, ain't no tellin' where I stay
Smell the green
I got Louis bags look like coffee
