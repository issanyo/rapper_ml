[Intro: Yung Lean & Yayoyanoh]
You gon' make me fly
Yeah, yo
I got a microphone

[Hook: Yayoyanoh]
Fine girl in my ride and i'm so so so
Pretty little lie like she go for the low
Trust king, make her get a microphone
Why her, just so i can take her home
Sweat down shawty pussy got me so sky high
Heaven and she doin' tricks so Sci Fi
Money they can do is shine life
Like the stranger things that gon' make me fly

[Verse 1: Yayoyanoh]
So when girl are we gonna have a song
You're a shiny girl we can take shots of the rum
And then i can have the water after [?]
Im'a have a party just for us my son
She goes over sea just to cheat on her man
Then she comes pree me and meet me, my god
So jelly wanna join in look
Now i got two kids to control my item
Girl you and you're a back one
So damn hot now your back one
I tricked her, it was in a bandoo
And you did my tricks it was not caught
For four minutes it goes me see
On the head doll on the Bentley
I'm too with the game freaky for me
Now [?] of this done took this street

[Hook: Yayoyanoh]
Fine girl in my ride and i'm so so so
Pretty little lie like she go for the low
Trust king, make her get a microphone
Why her, just so i can take her home
Sweat down shawty pussy got me so sky high
Heaven and she doin' tricks so Sci Fi
Money they can do is shine life
Like the stranger things that gon' make me fly

[Verse 2 : Yung Lean]
Stardust in my eye, eye, eye
Shawty we go high, high, high
We go up to the sky, sky, sky
And we drop it low, shawty gettin' 'em bags for the low
And we get it and we poppin' and we movin'
Everybody know Leandoer, we be grooving
Shawty bag it up, just so I can stack it up
Stardust in my eye, eye, eye
And we so fly, fly, fly
Posted up with Yayo bitch and get high, high, high
And it's nothing to big boss, nothing to Leandoer, big gram, big cross
And we get sky high, all up in the molly and we get fly wine, wine, wine
And we get fly right, fly like diamonds in my chain white, white (Leandoer!)
And you know we back on it, fellin' like it's a [?] moment
And it can take forever, but last a moment

[Hook: Yayoyanoh]
Fine girl in my ride and i'm so so so
Pretty little lie like she go for the low
Trust king, make her get a microphone
Why her, just so i can take her home
Sweat down shawty pussy got me so sky high
Heaven and she doin' tricks so Sci Fi
Money they can do is shine life
Like the stranger things that gon' make me fly

[Outro: Yung Lean]
You gon' make me fly, you gon' make me fly
You got blue sky
