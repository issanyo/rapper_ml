[Hook]
Stars align, shadows in the sky
I bring the night alive, creepin' like a spy
I'm swimmin' with the devil, I'm alone tonight
I'm swimmin' with the devil, I'm alone tonight
Stars align, shadows in the sky
I bring the night alive, creepin' like a spy
I'm swimmin' with the devil, I'm alone tonight
I'm swimmin' with the devil, I'm alone tonight

[Verse]
Border patrol, imported kilos of blow
I'm in a Range Rover, sold out the shows
I like my yellow like gold
Hundreds my rolls, show up in 'dro
Wherever I go they think that they know
I'm with my bros, don't talk to po-po, Y-3 my toes
I lost my soul, I pour up a four, I think I need more
I think I need more, a friend from a foe, I make it snow
When I'm alone, when I'm alone, leany gets sore, leany gets sore
Life is a bore, I don't need no more, I don't need no more
Superman captured, I go in, I go all out
Tags on my jeans they all watchin when I walk out
Yeah, I'm a dropout 'member when they used to doubt
You know what I'm about, you know what I'm about
Far in the distance, come close, make you scream and shout
Far in the distance, come close, make you scream and shout
Far in the distance, come close, make you scream and shout
Swimmin' with the devil, I'm alone tonight

[Hook]
Stars align, shadows in the sky
I bring the night alive, creepin' like a spy
I'm swimmin' with the devil, I'm alone tonight
I'm swimmin' with the devil, I'm alone tonight
Stars align, shadows in the sky
I bring the night alive, creepin' like a spy
I'm swimmin' with the devil, I'm alone tonight
I'm swimmin' with the devil, I'm alone tonight

Harmonizing

[Hook]
Stars align, shadows in the sky
I bring the night alive, creepin' like a spy
I'm swimmin' with the devil, I'm alone tonight
I'm swimmin' with the devil, I'm alone tonight
