[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
We rollin’ round, segway scooters
Shooting Lasers, bring you down
Gotta grind everyday, like get the fucking money now
All these bitches tryna hold me down
Demons in the wind, I'll be puffing on clouds
We rollin’ round, segway scooters
Shooting Lasers, bring you down
Gotta grind everyday, like get the fucking money now
All these bitches tryna hold me down
No one on our level shawty
How you like us now?

[Hook: Yung Lean]

[Verse 2: Thaiboy]
I been rollin’ round, how you like me now? (Thaiboy)
How you like me now, how you like me now?
No one on my level how you like me now?
With some work, count it like you’ve never heard
With my money take you from the earth
Watch me do, all I do is splurge
Doing what I choose, all I do is splurge
Yeah I’m still  numbing nigga's earth
Thaiboy, Thaiboy, swag, do all the work (all the work)
Thaiboy, Thaiboy, cash doing all the earth (all the earth)
Thaiboy, I don’t lie, still far from perfect

[Verse 3: Yung Lean]
I'm on top of the earth with Darth Vader snorting blow
If you tell me do that, I'll probably say no
Six blunted skeletons with me wherever I go
It’s whatever, live forever
So I pour it up slow
I got the best of that shit, breaking bottles in the snow
Euros, hundreds, hundreds, ice, diamonds, sipping Coke though
Sixties, fifties, spend them so I can’t see no evil spirits
Bitch I've been blessed

[Hook: Yung Lean]
How, how, how you like me now, shawty?
