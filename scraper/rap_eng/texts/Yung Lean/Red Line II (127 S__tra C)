Cut his head off with a bread saw
When will shawty know that I ball
Six gold chains in a Benz car
Stand far, she stand far away with the med jar

Smile on my face
I wanna kill the fucking landlord
Smile on my face
I wanna go away

I ball, yes, gold Rolex I ain't paid for
Roses on the sanctuary, gone like I'm Chuck Norris
More of this, more of me, they all want more Lean
I guess I have to work everyday like there is more of me
Rest my head on the stone pillar, I'm immortal B
Talk to myself in a church with distortion, see
I don't wanna give up, I ain't sure as hell giving in
Watch my body fall off a cliff as I slit my wrists
Slit my wrists, I love my bitch, shes the reason i do this shit
Karaoke in Japan with a dead girl in my forest, bitch
Bitch, I see evil every day I know what makes you smile
I ain't tryna conversate but you've been looking for a while

Get me home, get me gone, got your picture on my wall
Paint it red like the tag on my Adderall
I just want to ball, I just want to ball

Get me home, get me gone, got your picture on my wall
Paint it red like the tag on my Adderall
I just want to ball

Lean, know what it do
I came through
I been looking for someone like you
Like you

Cut his head off with a bread saw
When will shawty know that I ball
Six gold chains in a Benz car
Stand far, she stand far away with the med jar

Smile on my face
I wanna kill the fucking landlord
Smile on my face
I wanna go away

Smile on my face
I wanna kill the fucking landlord
Smile on my face
I wanna go away

Smile on my face
I wanna kill the fucking landlord
Smile on my face
I wanna go away

Cut his head off with a bread saw
When will shawty know that I ball
Six gold chains in a Benz car
Stand far, she stand far away with the med jar

Smile on my face
I wanna kill the fucking landlord
Smile on my face
I wanna go away
