Head to toe, Louis V and Rafs
127, yeah we ball like that
Going plus getting stacks, but I ain't into math
I be in a castle making calls like that
Head to toe, Louis V and Rafs
127, yeah we ball like that
Going plus getting stacks, but I ain't into math
I be in a castle making calls like that

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
What you want, call Bladee, he gon' get it for you, facts
What you need, want coke, got a weed filled bag
Been through hell, seen ghosts, you can't walk my path
I've been to clouds, need a perc, and double cup my hand
Popping pills like Scooby snacks, seeing colors, apple jacks
Please, I can't excuse my being, SBE roll off a bean
Gucci, Louis, on my tee, shawty wanna get with me
They knew we were a problem they knew not to fuck with lean

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Head to toe, Louis V and Rafs

Going plus getting stacks but I ain't into math
I be in a castle making calls like that
Head to toe, Louis V and Rafs
127, yeah we ball like that
Going plus getting stacks but I ain't into math
I be in a castle making calls like that

[Verse 2: Bladee]
12 skulls, bathed in blood
10 pills, I'm destroyed
I'm up, don't need love
Louis V, black rug
Ice king, I'm back up
Get back bitch, back up
She said I'm fucked up
I'm Gucci, draped up

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Head to toe, Louis V and Rafs
127, yeah we ball like that
Going plus getting stacks but I ain't into math
I be in a castle making calls like that
Head to toe, Louis V and Rafs
127, yeah we ball like that
Going plus getting stacks but I ain't into math
I be in a castle making calls like that
