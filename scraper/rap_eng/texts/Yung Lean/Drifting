[Verse 1: Uli K]
Don't ask if I'm okay, got nothing to say
Let me sleep, don't wanna see today
Need to cut you off, be by myself
You used to help now your breaking up my health
I been bleeding everyday, it doesn't matter anymore
It's just a matter of fact you always leave me sore
I wish I could stay, but I can do no more

[Chorus: Malibu]
And I'm drifting
Cut off from the ones I was loving
And I dived in
This cold ocean, I can feel like my life's escaping
Now I'm drifting
Pull out all the pain that keep sadden my brain
Tear out all the tears that have been stuck for so many years

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
Fuckers got no sense, smell like green roses
I'm overdosin' I'm ballin' I can't focus
I don't want no stress only you, I'm hopeless
Always in motion, leave me in the ocean
When I'm with you I show emotions, golden potions
Shawty on the potion, shawty off the dope man
All my boys rollin' in a, rollin' in a lotus
Rollin' in a lotus, I don't do no photos

[Chorus: Malibu]
And I'm drifting
Cut off from the ones I was loving
And I dived in
This cold ocean, I can feel like my life's escaping
Pull out all the pain that keep sadden my brain
Tear out all the tears that have been stuck for so many years
