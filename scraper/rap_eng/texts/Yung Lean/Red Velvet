[Intro: Yung Lean]
(Holy)
Lean
Bladeecity
(Lean)

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Bitch, I'm in the black light street 'cause it make sense
If it don't add up, crush it, give it more ent
Come in with the Garbage Pail Kids; we some tyrants
Leave that shit to me; I take 'em out; I got a license
Drenched in snow look like blow, blow, blow
Puerto Rican gold just for my nose, nose, nose
Never ending story on the road, road, road
Me and Bladee gon' pop 'em like some toast, toast, toast (Lean!)

[Verse 2: Bladee]
It's a movie man, HD, I make it three-peat
Bleed on me like Fiji; I'm trapped in 3D
It's me and Leany, gone, I feel like E.T
Easy, for you it was hard; for me it's easy
I make you see me, 3M, bitch, you're geeky
Prada, no CC, old dog, you can't teach me
Pressure on me, G, play you like a CD
I'm up at 8:30 chasing the feeling

[Verse 3: Yung Lean]
Mouth filled with blood; now I got blood on my rug
Ten X-pills; ten bitches in the tub
Meals with my team and you crawling for the crumbs
I was born in the cave; baptized in the mud
Me and the gang in an Uber creepin' up
Two blunts up and two cups stuffed
I'm done with this city; y'all some rats and some bums
Checks on checks, paper planes, tear it up

[Verse 4: Bladee]
Fuck it, I make a movie with you, cut it
Sacrifice myself for you, now I'm bloody
I'm not a lover, move, switch side to the other
I'm with Yung Lean, man, that's my fucking brother!

[Verse 5: Yung Lean]
Fuck it, BladeeCity, that's my brother
World War IV got the twin towers busting
Fuck it, mixing bleach with my cousin
With the family; we stay loyal like the Russians

[Verse 6: Bladee]
I'm crushing dirty pills up; I need a couple (dirty pills)
Harry and Meghan, man, show you how much I love it
I want the trouble, straight pain, don't need a stunt double
Comfortable, middle of the winter it feel like summer

[Verse 7: Yung Lean]
Hop out, rockin' D&G, haha, we the new KGB
Don't know what you see in me; my wrist laser, no EMP
Hop out rockin' APC; restin' under my cherry tree
My soulmate buy the Burberry, but I be sippin' Hennessy

[Verse 8: Bladee]
Red velvet
I'm selfish
10 bands just to go and eat some shellfish
I felt it; I felt it
We can't go on like Elvis
Fuck it, I make a movie with you, cut it
Sacrifice myself for you, now I'm bloody
Fuck it, I make a movie with you, cut it
Sacrifice myself for you and now I'm bloody

[Outro: Yung Lean]
(Lean!)
