[Intro]
Tell me you’re wild, wanna die, wanna uh

[Hook]
God only knows what I might do
God only knows what I might do
I don't fuck with god I'm my own proof(SBE!)
God only knows what I might do (Leandoer!)
Take two of these feel like Goku (Like Goku!)
Eyes Chinese when I roll through (Skrt, skrt, skrt!)
Mixing medication up, no tofu
I'm soul-less, my soul loose

[Verse 1:]
Take two of these feel I like Goku
My eyes Chinese when I roll through
When i fuck my soul loud, I need soul food
I gotta run for my live I can't hold you
If you want me to know, I can show you
6 inches on my sword, I feel like Kung-Fu
(Ooh sleep, Ooh sleep, I don’t give a fuck, my pills look like scooby-doo)
I don't give a fuck (SBE)
I blow my mind up in pieces
Wish I never lived in this secret
Ay I'm me, I'm me, I'm free bitch
Nothing ever comes for free bitch
I can't even count to three bitch
If you wanna tell me what the fuck to do
I don't fuck with you
How many times I gotta prove to myself what I do
My gadgets they be water-proof
I'm stuntin' on my Exes
See me out in Texas
Riding in the Lexus
I call that "Texas Reckless"
Candy coloured painted necklace  on my face
Flamingos rushing if you wanna take a chase
I run fast bitch
R-R-Run

[Hook]
God only knows what I might do
God only knows what I might do
I don't fuck with god I'm my own proof
Take two of these I feel like Goku
Eyes Chinese when I roll through
Mixing medication up, no tofu
Where the fuck my soul? my soul lose
6 inches on my sword, I need like Kung-Fu
Take two of these I  feel like Goku

[Verse 2]
I feel like Goku
Like GG Allin, Don't be fucking up my fun
Pink skies, fuck life bitch, you know I fuck
I'm smoking purple snakes
I'll never be done, got a stun gun
Making songs like it's my last one
Tryna get this cash you know it's coming son
61 sum never done, never done
Chain made Swiss lace
A bow and arrow when I come through
Mirror antique
I'm not looking like you
I don't work for you
I don't do nothing for you
I do it for me-e-e-e, lil bitch!
I'm smoking lavender
Like Swiss caliper
You know my burdies purr
I got a pink fern
On my girl you know I don't go with her
Got pearls on my necklace
I be stuntin'
Lil bitch
(I'm pretty as fuck)
