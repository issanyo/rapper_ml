[Hook x4]
Blowin' THC, shawty wanna come with me
Pull off floatin' hoverboard, damn no one can run from me

[Verse]
On my TV-screen, out in Sicily
All these fuccboi's mad I don't give a fuck cause I am doing me
Bitch it's little Lean, dirty money stay clean
Keep textin' me, and calling me and I'm off the next flight its not hard for me
Bitch we SBE, Y-3’s and Louis V
I’m blowin' green on my iPhone, and my whole team out in Italy
Check my steez, you don't want to fuck with me
Only thing I love is my fans and friends and my mom and my family
Blowin' THC, bag full of LSD
When I look around, all I see is little kids that wanna act like me
You know me, walkin' in the streets and steal the snow soldiers
And I mute my volume to think of me
I'm blowin' THC, I think she's still into me, I'm poppin'
Shawty, she wanna roll with me
I'm blowin' THC, shawty wanna come with me
Like floatin' love, look down at the floor
Damn no one can run from me

[Hook x4]
Blowin' THC, shawty wanna come with me
Pull off floatin' hoverboard, damn no one can run from me
