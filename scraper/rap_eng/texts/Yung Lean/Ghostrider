[Verse]
Switchblade in my hand make you fall back
Flat on the ground make you fall flat
Rainbow dreamland take you far back
I'm up in the mountains with the stars man
I'm in the jungle flying round' like Tarzan
Xanax on, sent too many bars man
I'm gone been gone from the start man
Road warrior I do car jack
Suicide doors on my whip, what do you call that?
It's too late for me to crawl back
Still late she hasn't called back
I'm in the night wearing all black
Nightmare road flashbacks from all that
Won't let me in, fuck the guards man
Run around the world like a quarterback
I'm too busy got to much on my almanac
Feeling like a baller got a tall stack
Remember back when I dreamed about all that
White shadows, white smoke, white walls man
In a hospital got here in a taxi cab
Been fucked too long, fuck rehab
Pick up a tab and get it while I still laugh
Got an evil twin he's my better half
Addicted to green like a giraffe

[Pre-Hook]
With my boys riding round, we get the last laugh
When my boys riding round, we get the last laugh

[Hook]
Still in the shadows, I'm a ghost rider
Fuck your brain up, stay up til' it's lighter
Shawty looking good but I bet my shawty finer
I'mma shine forever no matter the weather
I'll do it either way, can't play the wicked games you play
Total eclipse my heart is grey, ice, blood all on my face

[Bridge]
Still in the shadows, still in the shadows
Still in the shadows, still in the shadows

[Hook]
Still in the shadows, I'm a ghost rider
Fuck your brain up, stay up til' it's lighter
Shawty looking good but I bet my shawty finer
I'mma shine forever no matter the weather
I'll do it either way, can't play the wicked games that you play
Total eclipse my heart is grey, stay on my grind like everyday
Ice, blood all on my face, ice, blood all on my face
Ice, blood all on my face, ice, blood all on my face

[Break]

Harmonizing

All on my face
Ice, blood all on my face, ice, blood all on my face

[Hook]
Still in the shadows, I'm a ghost rider
Fuck your brain up, stay up til' it's lighter
Shawty looking good but I bet my shawty finer
I'mma shine forever no matter the weather
Still in the shadows, I'm a ghost rider
Fuck your brain up, stay up til' it's lighter
Shawty looking good but I bet my shawty finer
I'mma shine forever no matter the weather
