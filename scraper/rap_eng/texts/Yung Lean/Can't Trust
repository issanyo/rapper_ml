[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
City on fire, y'all a bunch of liars, I got Fendi
Henny, Remy, we got plenty, riding in the Bentley
You're not a fucking soldier, twenty bitches eating Wendy's
Baby cobra bending corners, leave you dead like Kenny
Standing on a bridge, I want a perfect ending
They put me down with needles in my arms, I can't defend it
Me and Thaiboy out in Taipei, popping pills at weddings
I need some soda, Gucci odor, percs up in my setting
You fucks pretending, man we started this, you know I meant it
Bumping Darkthrone, sipping gasoline, medication helping
Got a knife, my leather jacket, bitches see my medals
Children choir, can't retire, we at Ed Edd n' Eddy
Dark sunset in a condo, shawty staying steady
All my boys are ready, you trust me I can't forget it
I love codeine, I love my bitch, we'll see you in Heaven
All my boys are ready, you trust me I can't forget it
City on fire, y'all a bunch of liars, I got Fendi
Henny, Remy, we got plenty, riding in the Bentley
You're not a fucking soldier, twenty bitches eating Wendy's
You disrespect the set my bitches wet their trousers standing

Girl I can't trust
Girl I can't trust
Girl I can't trust
Judging by the way you say you miss me
How can I trust
Girl I can't trust
Girl I can't trust
Girl I can't trust
Judging by the way you say you love me
How can I trust

[Verse 2: Thaiboy Digital]
How can I trust, girl how can I trust
It's not that I don't love you no more, girl I just can't stop
How can I trust, girl how can I trust
Say that you don't go out no more girl but then you show up at the club
I just can't trust, I want to be the one
Why you don't hurt me no more girl, why you can't trust
What about us, baby what about us
I can't keep going like this no, I don't want none
Can you tell me baby what you want from me, what you want from me
Why do I get feeling like you playing me, why you playing me
Thaiboy Goon, SG, baby you know who I be, (you know) who I be
I don't know baby but you be draining me, girl you envy me

[Hook: Thaiboy Digital]
Girl I can't trust
Girl I can't trust
Girl I can't trust
Judging by the way you say you miss me
How can I trust
Girl I can't trust
Girl I can't trust
Girl I can't trust
Judging by the way you say you love me
How can I trust
