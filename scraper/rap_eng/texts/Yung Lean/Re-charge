[Hook: Baba Stiltz]
Recharge my whole life
Upload all my sorrow
Smoking, feeling so nice
No tomorrow

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Leave out the hotel exit
They gon' leave you when you least expect it
I'm expected to be reckless, I don't need acceptance
Tan lines on my necklace, ocean water for breakfast
Smoking like my lungs infected
Smoking out in Vancouver, I be on an all time high
Pink slippers, pink slip- ca-catch me sippin' Indian chai
Do you still wanna die? Sometimes I feel nice
Most times it feels right, re-charge, re-live and re-die
We get, Asics on my feet
Edward Norton, no sleep
Out in Dubai for three weeks
I be with my team
White phone, no clone
Lean, lean, a broken home
Fuck with me, I'll break your bones

[Hook: Baba Stiltz]
Recharge my whole life
Upload all my sorrow
Smoking, feeling so nice
No tomorrow

[Verse 2]
I be getting money like my first name Curren$y
Switching lanes, switch address like they heard of me
The further we go, I'ma put you in the snow
I'ma leave you where it's cold
Do you wanna recharge?
Penthouse on Mars
Bars like a prisoner
I could be your minister
Dreams looking sinister
I could be your minister
Dreams looking sinister

[Hook: Baba Stiltz]
Recharge my whole life
Upload all my sorrow
Smoking, feeling so nice
No tomorrow
