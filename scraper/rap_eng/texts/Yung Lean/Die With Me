[Intro: Yung Lean]
Leeeeeaan
Sad Boooooooys

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
M-Make your presence felt, what they know about me?
See me in the streets, keep my boys around me
Keep the block behind me
I want to make everyone happy, ain't no' sad about me
There's a show around me, keep my boys around me
Keep the block behind me
I want to make everyone happy, ain't no' sad about me
Burberry print silk sheets when I sleep
By the stars, Milky Way, that's where I be
Burberry print silk sheets when I sleep
By the stars, Milky Way, that's where I be
Iced out, counting bread
Lights out, now my mind won't go to rest
Iced out, counting bread
Now my mind won't go to rest
My mind won't go to rest
I want to die with you, maybe once
I want to die with you, maybe once
I'm worthless, I'm nothing
I'm the best out, I don't give a fuck about nothing
When I look in the mirror, all I see is nothing
I wouldn't even be pissed if you left me (left me)
Make your presence felt, what they know about me?
See me in the streets, there's a show around me
Keep the block behind me
Want to make everyone happy, ain't no' sad about me
Burberry print silk sheets when I sleep
By the stars, Milky Way that's where I be
Burberry print silk sheets when I sleep
By the stars, Milk Way, that's where I be
Iced out, counting bread
Lights out, now my mind won't go to rest
Iced out, counting bread
Iced out, counting bread
Lights out, now my mind won't go to rest
I want to die with you, I want to die with you
I want to die maybe once
I want to die with you, I want to die with you
I want to die maybe once
What they know about me?
See me in the streets, there's a show around me
Keep my boys around me (Sad Boys), keep the block behind me
I want to make everyone happy, ain't no' sad about me
Ain't nothing sad about me (Sad Boys)
Burberry print silk sheets when I sleep
By the stars, Milky Way, that's where I be
Burberry print silk sheets when I sleep
By the stats, Milky Way, that's where I be
I-I-Iced Out, counting bread
Iced out, counting bread
Lights out, now my mind won't go to rest
