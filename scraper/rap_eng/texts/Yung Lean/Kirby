[Hook: Yung Lean]
Watch, my ring
Cost more than drugs, it seems
I'm falling in love, Kirby my drink
Money on deck, meet me in the back

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Remixing and pouring the drink (remix)
Leandoer fuck what you think (fuck what you think)
Mind fucking these girls like a shrink (shrink)
Cannons, my balls make you sink (you sink)
I'm flipping the pack, money pink (flipping)
SBE in this bitch I got stink (SBE)
Came thru' with a rug made of mink (mink)
I'm geeking, my Balmain's all pink (geeking)
Whitearm, smoking dope, make it stink (smoking dope)
They call me up when I link
Bitch I just left a new flight
I'm falling I'm falling on sight
I think that she might be my type (my type)
Prada shades on my face, I'm alright
My chain black and my diamonds white
Fuck all the fame and the hype
Lean

Watch, my ring
Cost more than drugs, it seems

Money on deck, meet me in the back
My watch, my ring
Cost more than drugs, it seems
I'm falling in love, Kirby my drink
Money on deck, meet me in the back
