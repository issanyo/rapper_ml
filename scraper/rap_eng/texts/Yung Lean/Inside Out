[Intro: Bladee]
Drain Gang

[Chorus: Bladee]
Come to me inside out, from the inside
I get a car from you, after midnight
I do a street fight, I get my three strikes
Lie down and bleed out just to see you smile
Come with no makeup on, with your hair out
Come to the backstage, I'm in the Red Light
I lay awake late nights, past my bedtime
For some of your time, just to see you smile

[Bridge: Yung Lean]
Yeah we geeked up forreal, how 'bout you?
Yeah we geeked up forreal, staying true
Yeah we geeked up forreal, staying true
Yeah we geeked up forreal, shawty, how 'bout you?

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Sunsets, set me free, new light, make me me
How I really understand how it happened so fast
Peace from the dark soul
It make me smile, yeah, that make me smile
Pray to the wind
I been gone for some time, (I've been) gone for some time, Lean

[Chorus: Bladee]
Come to me inside out, from the inside
I get a car from you, after midnight
I do a street fight, I get my three strikes
Lie down and bleed out just to see you smile
Come with no makeup on, with your hair out
Come to the backstage, I'm in the Red Light
I lay awake late nights, past my bedtime
For some of your time, just to see you smile
Come to me inside out, from the inside out
I get a car for you, after midnight
