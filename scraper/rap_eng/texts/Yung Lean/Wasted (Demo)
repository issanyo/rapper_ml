[Intro: Yung Lean]
Yeah, Lean

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted, I'm too wasted
If I really wanna get it, you know I'ma take it
Mixing-mixing ice, Sad Boys, you know we made it
I be so damn gone that I'm feeling like I'm lazy
In that white Range Rover, driving, bet you know I'm wasted
SBE, blowin' cash fast, spend it to the last rack
Livin' life the fast track, an' she's blowin' Sad Pack
SBE got sad, man, you know I'm so wasted
I'm so high like a tower (tower), I picture myself being higher (higher)
I wipe my face off with a towel (towel), I'm smoking spirits, I'm a fighter (fighter)
I'm so wasted

[Hook: Travis Scott & Yung Lean]
I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted
Mix the Sprite with Xanny, lean is how we taste it
I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted
Yeah, the rockstar-life we live is so amazing, woo
I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted (Leandoer)
Mix the Sprite with Xanny, lean is how we taste it
I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted
Yeah, the rockstar-life we live is so amazing, woo (yeah)
Woo, whoo

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted
Molly, Xan' an' lean an' percocets an' I feel racy
I got that ice, I got that ice, it's not Fugazi
My crew done been done hold the block, we shoot that sprayin'
Come in here clean, you know we rasta like Jamaicans
Dreadlocks, we swayin', I'm in common, I'm too lazy
An' then we block it out that plaza and I'm too wasted
We got that ice, we got that golden, don't be patient
An' I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted
I got that ice in my chain, yeah, that's no Fugazi
I got that wrist that work, that wrist that work, that crazy
I got that good dick that-that BJ make 'em crazy, woo
