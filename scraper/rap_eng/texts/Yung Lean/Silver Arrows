[Chorus]
Sapphire, diamonds, iced out, want my money right now
Cashin' out, I'm cashed out, hit you in the chest now
Silver arrows my sound, fuck them all, I might die
I be up on cloud nine, green laces, smoke clouds

[Verse 1]
All my boys with me we hop out the rental (rental)
She lickin' my scars, she go down, I was mental
At the psych ward, couldn't finish my sentence
Looked in the mirror, I was full of vengeance
Yellow Hummer, give a fuck about anything
Frost over the fan, fuck you over on everything
Jugging forever, now I want the Bentley, man
Trapped in the spirit, I can't see the endin', man

[Bridge]
Silk dreams, light works, I don't care if they call now
Mist fiends, glowworms, I'm just tryna ball out
Feet of mars, Hollister bags in the mall now
Gotta pick myself up, I dont care if I fall out

[Chorus]
Sapphire, diamonds, iced out, want my money right now
Cashing out, I'm cashed out, hit you in the chest now
Silver arrows my sound, fuck them all I might die
I be up on cloud nine, Green laces, smoke clouds

[Verse 2]
Was a little stoner, my eyes were so reddy, man
Fuck is he doin'? My whole crew be ready, man
Never realised I would hop out in Chevy, man
Ecstasy fine, but my Giuseppe steppin', man
14 in the club when I'm poppin' them pills and them
Thaiboy, he told me go ahead and stunt on them
Don't like piggies, go ahead ash a blunt on them
Demons in my head now I am well at least
Three stripes, three heavens and I want plenty keys
My girl was mine 'cause I was on Fendi
They just popped a flat I got like ten with me
Walkin' through the fire

[Outro]
Sapphire, diamonds, iced out, want my money right now
Cashing out, I'm cashed out, hit you in the chest now
Silver arrows my sound, fuck them all I might die
I be up on cloud nine, green laces, smoke clouds
Sapphire, diamonds, iced out, want my money right now
Cashing out, I'm cashed out, hit you in the chest now
Silver arrows my sound, fuck them all I might die
I be up on cloud nine, green laces, smoke clouds
