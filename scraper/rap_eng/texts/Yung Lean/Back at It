[Intro: Yung Lean]
Codeine demon
Yoshi City soldiers
SBE
Lil Bitch
Leandoer, Lean, Lean, Lean, Lean, Leandoer
Lean, Leandoer
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy on my soul

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Ba-ba-back at it again, I'm feeling like I'm well again
Chains, black diamonds, and I'm looking like the revenant
I used to sell wine and I really love selling shit
Up in the club they looking at me like a fellow man
Back at it again, I'm feeling like I'm well again
Chains, black diamonds, and I'm looking like the revenant
I used to sell wine and I really love selling shit
Up in the club they looking at me like a fellow man

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
I'm flipping and tripping the stacks
All I got on me is racks
Call Bladee and he get you some packs
Loud pack came in a sack
I'm rolling on diamonds, why ask?
Black diamonds pink shirt and I'm cashed out
Fucking these bitches and pass out
I don't do talking my rack house
I'm in it for good there's no back out
I love how she dance, she stand out
We grinding like skaters no hand outs
You want the work you gotta put out
All of the time that you spend now
I hit the mall and I buy out
My team ain't no football team tryout
We smashing bottles and ounces and blackout

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Back at it again, I'm feeling like I'm well again
Chains, black diamonds, and I'm looking like the revenant
I used to sell wine and I really love selling shit
Up in the club they looking at me like a fellow man

[Verse 2: LoLife Blacc]
Packs sold, forklift, hands-on
Honestly, [?] any middle man
I'm whole-selling pints percs and xans
Still up in the ticket, not driving for my man
I'm never on the grind, never on the plan
Work the scale, scale and pound, pistols in my hand
Work the scale on the motherfucking SoundScan
Your favorite trapper rapping shit he still my biggest fan
Trap I snowed up like a motherfucking ambulance
Cut up more time up bitch I ain't no ambulance
I'm still taxing these taxes, see me trapping shit
I ain't from shit, I need my cash on demand
Made a lot of money with a fork and a pan
These niggas be snitching shit I don't understand
Watching the camera no need for no man
I can put it in the hole, I can put it in the van
I grew up like Friend putting dope in the can
Watching the camera get the dope for Roxanne
She ask could I front her some raw Jackie Tan
That's like pimpin a bitch that ain't selling no ass
Watching the camera for 12 or black masks
It don't matter which one ima blast they ass
I ain't turning myself in, they gotta catch my ass
I do that lil time and come back for a second chance

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Back at it again, I'm feeling like I'm well again
Chains black diamonds, and I'm looking like the revenant
I used to sell wine and I really love selling shit
Up in the club they looking at me like a fellow man
Back at it again, I'm feeling like I'm well again
Chains black diamonds, and I'm looking like the revenant
I used to sell wine and I really love selling shit
Up in the club they looking at me like a fellow man
