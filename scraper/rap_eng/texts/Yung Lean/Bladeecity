[Verse 1: Bladee]
I have sunlight on me like earth
I'm tryin' to get clean, wash away the dirt
I want to hold you so bad right now
I bought a pack of the air plane loud
If you go up against me, you'll go down
If you go up against me, you'll go down
Inside the shadows, they come out at night
All that I want is to enter the light
After I die, I wake up and I rise
T-shirt is black and I XL the size

[Hook: Bladee]
Six cell phones but no one to call to
Bladeecity, I wonder where are you
Face is clean but my conscience is dirty
Mercedes, had to put it on thirty
Bladeecity, I had to put it on thirty
Face is clean but my conscience is dirty
Mercedes, had to put it on thirty
Bladeecity, I had to put it on thirty

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
Won't see a smile on my face
I'm so sad, I'm so icy, bang-bang to your face
I pity the world before I go to my dreams
I sleep when I don't need, I'm in a fantasy street
I'll be schemin' and leanin', ya'll try to be seen
But when I'm all alone, I'm real sad in the evening
Counting money like a preacher, champagne fries in my freezer
I sip Arizona by the liter, you don't like humans, me neither
Sushi lunch before I meet her, I bring myself down if I see her
I look down when I meet her

[Bridge: Bladee]
T-shirt is black and I XL the size

[Hook: Bladee]
Six cell phones but no one to call to
Bladeecity, I wonder where are you
Face is clean but my conscience is dirty
Mercedes, had to put it on thirty
Bladeecity, I had to put it on thirty
Face is clean but my conscience is dirty
Mercedes, had to put it on thirty
Bladeecity, I had to put it on thirty
