[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
B-bitch named Lean, Emperor of the city
Silver rings on, sitting on 50
Blowing on Winter, icy like a stunner
Looking like Winter, temperature like the summer
Chain like a seahorse, Is that really Leandoer?
All white Dior, all I wear is Dior
Catch me on my Samsung, SBE anthem
I be in the night creeping round' like the phantom

Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?
Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?
Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?

[Verse 2: Ecco2k & Yung Lean]
Airbrushed, Air ice like I’m 19
Light speed, colour, lime green look like ice cream
Light beam, call it light stream or you’ll white beam
Five keys or my eyes bleed on the Nikes
Headlock, scope red dot, It’s a head shot
Shell shock, do the air-drop, I got dead stock
Flow like purple drugs sprite, that's my blood type
I wish none of this was real life, but it's sunlight
You don't know what I'm up to
We don't talk about it 'less you do
Got a fight crew, we sky team
Shoot around town, got bad dreams
It’s weed and purple we up to
Just got a bunch of em’ Nike shoes
For I make big money, my own crew too
We the Sadboys and we’ll fuck you
