[Hook: Yung Lean] x2
I don't go no where, no where
Without my boys
Counting dough
Neon stacks all in a row
I be counting all this money in a row
Skrrt skrrt
Bitch you know I'm getting throwed

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Leandoer, shawty I make it start raining
SBE yeah and all my boys be draining
Sharpening their knives all them be slaying
Look up to the sky, lord needs to save me
My dope it came from Ecuador
Cocaine from El Salvador
Giuseppe dancing, bought the store
What you want bitch? watchin' gore
Bow and arrow in my drawer
What is love really good for?
You count some but we count more
Working 'till my body's sore
Stack it, stack it, stack it, stack it
I could never stop
SBE and Drain Gang
Man we see you at the top
I don't give a fuck I be counting all this dough
Pull up in the club and I'm moving in a row
Shawty want that cash so you know I gotta move slow
Shawty want that cash so you know I gotta move slow

[Hook: Yung Lean] x2
I don't go no where, no where
Without my boys
Counting dough
Neon stacks all in a row (Skert, skert)
I be counting all this money in a row
Skrrt skrrt
Bitch you know I'm getting throwed

[Verse 2: Jace]
I said bitch I'm never lonely
And my wrist called bottle 40, uh
In here with my bro
These necklace shining like a roley
Chiefing on that doddie and I'm sipping on some codeine
Holy hoes in foreign clothing
Why my soldier overflowing said
I don't fuck with no new boys, I'm a jerk
Only do the kush never purp
I just spilled syrup on my shirt
Just popped a percocet and I'm about to go bezerk
9 to 5 my gang nigga, go to work
I was the first to say first
You pussy nigga where's your purse?
Fuck with the gang and it only gets worse
Cause we gone fuck your girlfriend while The Office playing
I'mma fuck her once then fuck all her friends
I don't need permission from no bitches
I'm riding through the six on sixes
Plus I'm with all my niggas so you better mind your business

[Hook: Yung Lean] x2
I don't go no where, no where

Counting dough
Neon stacks all in a row (Skert, skert)
I be counting all this money in a row
Skrrt skrrt
