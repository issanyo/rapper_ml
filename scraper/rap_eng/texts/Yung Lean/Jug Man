[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
You know I don't give a fuck what it costs
I just buy it and keep it
I need twenty hoes, champagne, some dogs just float in the deep end
I got blunts in space I'm checking at the Four Seasons
They doubt me for no reason, I change it up like seasons
Your whole team filled with phonies my hotel room filled with 40's
They think do me they know some shawty ask like they owe me
What the fuck do you think I'm blowing
Get paid and fuck my opponents
I put it on my chest
Nina take care of my homies
Me, mug, jug, fuck your hoes [?]
SBE we only sip the bubbly
At the airport and they won't let me through customs
I got nothing to declare except your sister and her cousins
