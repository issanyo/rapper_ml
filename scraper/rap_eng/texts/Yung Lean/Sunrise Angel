[Verse 1]
Diamond in the wind
White diamonds across my skin
Sca-Sc-Scandinavian prince
Had to start over to begin
I’m not sorry for my sins
Been here forever, where you been?
Got that orange juice and Gin
Throw my conscious in a bin
Blowing smoke, neo rings
Dead, dead soul within
Dreaming thick, not thin
Thanks to the city where I’m in
I’m in the sea, but I can’t swim
Used to be nothing now I win
Left my soul to swim, left my, left my soul to swim

[Verse 2]
High on hope and I’m low on love
I ain’t got none of that white dove
Got butterflies and a white dove
I’m crazy and I know I am
Don’t talk to these fuckers, cause they know who I am
I am worried about nothing that’s just who I am
I am worried about you, what happened to we?
Riding the train everyday of the week
Writing this song on my phone as we speak
Kush in my lungs and I’ll die in my sleep
Kush in my lungs and I’ll die in my sleep
Heart on my sleeves
And I’ll crush you to pieces, European Jesus
Ego big as my phone breaking I don’t ever sleep cos
Thick stack racked up
Spend my money on a catbus
On a subway smoking green like a cactus
My life’s too real, fuck an actor
Say what you want you need to practice
I power up like King Kai
I’m smoking wind I’m flying high
No pretty circus, we riding out, we riding out

Sad money, dirty heaven, everything is made for
You make cash, I made more, careful
Sunrise Angel in my bed, nothing's made well
While Lean gets his cash then it’s farewell
