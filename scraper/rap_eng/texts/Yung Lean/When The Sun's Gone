[Intro: Yung Lean]
Lean

[Hook: Yung Lean]
If you act up
Shawty bring it over here
I've been riding round, I got diamonds in my ear
They gon' back up
When they see me disappear
When you working hard
Then your money just appear
If you act up
Shawty bring it over here
I've been riding round, I got diamonds in my ear
They gon' back up
When they see me disappear
When you working hard
Then your money just appear

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
She gon' stack up, yellow rubies at my sphere
Love the way she moves, she gon' whisper in my ear
You are baby, you can smell me when I'm near
[?], where the fuck were you last year?
Eighty five stacks in my chain some more
Do this for my family when the sun's gone
Ridin' on the dirt, I have a place, my son
Pumpkins in the snow, my boys rollin' scroll
Rollin' scrolling, gettin' hill, I ain't think they'll go in
After top drop top, you already know
Lean up in the snow, man, at the studio
Shawty yo' already know I get the drippin' roll

[Hook: Yung Lean]
If you act up
Shawty bring it over here
I've been riding round, I got diamonds in my ear
They gon' back up
When they see me disappear
When you working hard
Then your money just appear
If you act up
Shawty bring it over here
I've been riding round, I got diamonds in my ear
They gon' back up
When they see me disappear
When you working hard
Then your money just appear


[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
I don't do no drugs no more I'm learnin'
Doves flying through the roof they swervin'
You don't know the game you just observin'
The bad seem that's you are observed it
Shawty say it lookin' like a good person
Drug at the street I close the cardings
I was in a hole, hole, hole when it call, call, call
Ride round seem, burnin' cars, cars, cars
Cash, stack trynna be talk, talk, talk
I gave you everything at the star, star, star
(Leandoer!)

[Hook: Yung Lean]
If you act up
Shawty bring it over here
I've been riding round, I got diamonds in my ear
They gon' back up
When they see me disappear
When you working hard
Then your money just appear
If you act up
Shawty bring it over here
I've been riding round, I got diamonds in my ear
They gon' back up
When they see me disappear
When you working hard
Then your money just appear
