[Verse 1]
Nursery rhymes, I'm rehearsing zero times
We just two dimes, baseball bats, busting signs
Do it from behind
The devil is inside me I can see his face sometimes
When the sun shines, spliff in my hand
His face only comes up at night time
When there's no one left around
Find Yung Leandoer under cover
Not making a single sound
Tired of lingering round
Hire for bitching around
What comes around never comes back down
And I never back down
When it's time to face Lucifer face to face when the time runs out
[?] and I against the red clown

[Hook]
Shove a crucifix and a rope down your throat
Lucifer is watching in a rowing boat
Lower note:
Let's see what I got inside my black coat
A black rope and a black goat
Shove a crucifix and a rope down your throat
Lucifer is watching in a rowing boat
Lower note:
Let's see what I got inside my black coat
A black rope and a black goat

[Bridge]
Love rains down on me, on me, down on me
Love rains down on me
Yung Lean, the unseen

[Verse 2]
Treat her like a prostitute
Drinking margarita from a boot
Fucking bitches mute
She can't understand me but I think she's kinda cute
Her secret chamber looks like a fleshy fruit
Got a Leandoer base filled with nudes
This is my new recruit
You could try to multiply all you want, you're still a square root
I'm a preserver but dryin' like a dried fruit
She's on the couch watching Beavis and Butthead in her birthday suit
Drinking champagne flute
Salute

[Verse 3]
Come out the toilet, with vomit on my sweater
Lean fucking hoes heads, who can do it better?
Blood written love letters
Her body waste secretes
Her fucking fetish
Don't touch my Cheetos, she can have some cheddar
Cause I'll let her
Tell 'em Lean sent her back to the basement
Where the clockâ€™s on backwards
And everybody's back hurts from carrying AK47s from the pavement
This is a bold statement

[Hook]
Shove a crucifix and a rope down your throat
Lucifer is watching in a rowing boat
Lower note:
Let's see what I got inside my black coat
A black rope and a black goat
Shove a crucifix and a rope down your throat
Lucifer is watching in a rowing boat
Lower note:
Let's see what I got inside my black coat
A black rope and a black goat
