[Hook: Yung Lean]
I'm sippin', over 100 degrees
Posted with my boys, sippin' Hennessey
I'm trippin' shawty down on her knee's
Everything be okay I feelin' good in the breeze
I get it lit man, You know we overseas
Fly to Dubai, we'll be back in a week
Feelin' like a hitman, you won't barely see me
I'm gone in the wind, hiding in the streets

[Verse 1: ManeMane4CGG]
Yeah I'm sippin'
Yeah I'm sippin' lean
On the highway, hope I don't fall asleep
If she trippin' and she steady callin' me
She callin' my phone and she buggin' me
Yeah she trippin'
Yeah I'm doing these shows
I'm rockin' these shows and I can't come home
She said she miss me, baby I'm overseas
In the studio workin' with Yung Lean
(I'm gonna sip it)
And I'm smokin' weed
Two bad bitches and they right with me
It's me and Yung Lean, in the blood eighteen/bloody ting
4CG, KuKu Gang we overseas

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
I just popped a hydro pill I'm bout to lose my mind
You be watchin' every step biting on my style
Why you making music? man why you wasting time?
Watchin' all my videos and biting all my rhymes
Air Force 1’s so green look just like lime
Thaiboy Goon just poured a four and we about to fly
Runnin' round the airport with money on my line
Yung Leandoer don't give a fuck about the fame
I'm your girlfriends favourite rapper
All these other boys they lame
SBE, 4CG the team we switching lands like, switching lanes
I had to go to rehab they claimed I was insane
R-red roses in my bathtub,  don’t give a fuck about the game bitch
