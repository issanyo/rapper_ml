[Verse 1]
There's a feast going on and you wouldn't even know about it
A fights breaking out and they'll make a damn meal out of it
There's so much going wrong but I can't waste my time on things that won't change (yeah)
I'm a cool headed man but this one's got the best of me
I see reason and rhyme but someone stole my melodies
Maybe I should write a strongly worded letter but the sensible side of me says I should know better

[Chorus]
Take me down to the riverside
Show me good loving and a damn good time
Lord knows we need it
Lord knows it's leaving
Take me down and show me life
I'm feeling outdated I could use a new find
Lord knows we need it
Lord knows we're hanging out to dry
Hanging out to dry
Oh yeah well we're hanging it out to dry

[Verse 2]
Finding reasons to lie like its good for your shaking soul
Feel it twisting inside and you know just who's at fault
If you can't fix the world then fix the people who surround your matching throne

[Chorus]
Take me down to the riverside
Show me good loving and a damn good time
Lord knows we need it
Lord knows it's leaving
Take me down and show me life
I'm feeling outdated I could use a new find
Lord knows we need it
Lord knows we're hanging out to dry
Hanging out to dry
Oh yeah well we're hanging it out to dry

[Bridge]
I'm taking two steps forward and one step back
Never seen a happy man who ran a dead straight path
Times and twist and shaking hips and moments to be kept
Take it off in my friend you ain't seen nothing yet

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Take me down to the riverside
Show me good loving and a damn good time
Lord knows we need it
Lord knows it's leaving
Take me down and show me life
I'm feeling outdated I could use a new find
Lord knows we need it
Lord knows we're hanging out to dry
Hanging out to dry
Oh yeah well we're hanging it out to dry
