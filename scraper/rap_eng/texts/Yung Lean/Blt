[Verse 1: Ballout]
Ridin' in my new car
It's a spaceship, it's goin' too fast
And my new car got no rooftop
I'mma in Vegas in my new car
Glo gang got that cash, bitch
Glo gang got that mula
Put some money on your head, bitch
Glo gang come through, do ya?

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
Ridin' in my spaceship, I on't do no conversation
Unless that's money they makin', then i listen I don't say shit
I be, I be puffin' loud, I'm a star, I'm in the cloud
I be laughin' at these clowns, change my speed, I'm slowin' down
And I come through, be patient, SBE ridin' in spaceships
I be rollin' down a hill, pop a pill and stay faded

[Verse 3: Tadoe]
Ridin' in the [?] blocks, rollin' up hella dope
It ain't hard to see me, fuckin' glasses in ya telescope
Me and sosa, otto, on forgiato
Got your bitch with us, told to drink the lean straight up from the bottle
Oh won't they stop, I'mma borrow
Get that top and probably give her back tomorrow, I'm sorrow
215 up 'round the corner, made a hunnid thou off marijuana
I'm like wow! tryna rop 40 cal, boow!
