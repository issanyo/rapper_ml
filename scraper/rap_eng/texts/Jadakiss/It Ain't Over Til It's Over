[Intro: DJ Khaled & Jadakiss]
DJ, DJ, DJ Khaled! (Ah-hah!)

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I said we the best at making this green
I swear Mountain Dew ain't got nothing on my team
F is for the family that’s holding me down
I think niggas know who run this town
A is for the action I’m all about
Blow a nigga head off, kill all the doubt
B is for the big boys with the grown money
And bad bitches who ain't gotta spend their own money
Shots of 'Tron at like 4 in the morn'
It ain't over til it’s over, Loso I'm gone

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
The lights stay on, they don't fade
Ohh-ohh-whoa-ohh
Take my last call, don’t hold your breath
Ohh-ohh-whoa-ohh
Everyday make something outta nothing
Move a mountain and still keep running
Never come down, make no mistakes

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
They can say, ayy, that my end is on the horizon
When I wake, ayy, all I see is the sun rising
Just when I thought I said all there was to say
I get the last word, it ain't over til it's over
Just when I thought I did all there was to do
I give my best to you, it ain't over til it’s over
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh ohh ohh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, it ain't over til it’s over
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh ohh ohh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, it ain't over til it’s over

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I smoke weed, you sip on lean
People always sayin’ what the hell does that mean
J is for the justice I did to the game
Lot of these niggas that's on is lame
A is for the way I airs 'em out
Coupes by the two’s I pairs 'em out
D's for the dope that a nigga still pumping
Twelve hour shifts got the spot still jumping
Rocking on til the block is gone
.38 is snubnosed but the chopper's long

[Verse 4: Mary J. Blige]
And everything takes time so they say
Ohh-ohh-whoa-ohh
What has been on my side everyday
Ohh-ohh-whoa-ohh
Every second gone is another way to come up
Bend the corner, crash into the jackpot
Twists and turns I can take

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
They can say, ayy, that my end is on the horizon
When I wake, ayy, all I see is the sun rising
Just when I thought I said all there was to say
I get the last word, it ain't over til it's over
Just when I thought I did all there was to do
I give my best to you, it ain't over til it’s over
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh ohh ohh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, it ain't over til it’s over
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh ohh ohh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, it ain't over til it’s over
