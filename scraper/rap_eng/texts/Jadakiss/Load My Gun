[Intro: Styles P]
L-O-X shit, nigga
Trinity, ayy
Hah (hah)

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Whatchu think we do this shit for? Nigga, we was piss poor
Coke on the fifth floor
Fourth to the third and the second and the first and the sixth
Outside from the first to the sixth
Flippin' on a brick that I got from a Spanish nigga
Standin' with the cannon just ready to blam a nigga
Skippin' on a court 'cause the judge'll remand a nigga
Niggas say it's love but I know they can't stand a nigga, yeah
I'm familiar with the life
I got the fuck out 'cause I'm familiar with the night
And a knife and the ice and a car that is high priced
Gettin' knocked from the cops and spinnin' the yard twice
Thousand push-ups a night, hittin' the bar twice
Reminiscin' over pussy and money and bar fights
Me? I hit the X and get hit in the hard right
'Bout to blend in with the stars, my nigga, I'm alright
Half sun, half moon, my nigga, I'm all bright
If you fuck with The LOX, you know that it's on sight
Master of the goon talk, yet and still a wizard barefoot in a blizzard
I could fuck around and moonwalk
Hustle, I could talk to a fork, knock a spoon off
May pay me enough, nigga, I knock June off
It's the Phantom, call me an entity
Soul is real, old, my nigga, couple of centuries, yeah

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
See these niggas act stupid when the weather get warm
Y'all been lettin' these fuck niggas slide too long
You don't wanna get clapped, I suggest you move on
You could try to come back but my niggas too strong
I'm just tryna get away yo, from the yayo and the hatin' niggas on my block
I'm just tryna avoid the police, see a mill' piece but these niggas won't let me rock
So I load my gun

[Verse 2: Dave East]
My vest on, I brought two hammers, it ain't no goon with me
Bury you in your Yeezys have Kanye read the eulogy
You owe me but I know you broke, I'll settle for your jewelry
Even if it's fake, we might could sell it out the state
Loud mouth nigga
I don't thnk you could yell without your face
Startin' fire, snitchin', these niggas is tellin' out the gate (rat)
Transporter, know I still can send a bail without a trace
Fifty percent jealously and the other half is hate
Fuck the status, niggas aggy 'cause they average and I'm great
Stab 'em with the same knife I use to cut my steaks
Say my grace before I treat a nigga face like my plate
Early at this guap, y'all niggas in a race to be late
Switch side when they hate you, probably mention me too
I had the molly when Pharrell was sayin' Mr. Me Too
Waited in lines on 55th just to see Skip To My Lou
Then Biggavel' had me sippin' on KRU
Gimme the loot

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
See these niggas act stupid when the weather get warm
Y'all been lettin' these fuck niggas slide too long
You don't wanna get clapped, I suggest you move on
You could try to come back but my niggas too strong
I'm just tryna get away yo, from the yayo and the hatin' niggas on my block
I'm just tryna avoid the police, see a mill' piece but these niggas won't let me rock
So I load my gun

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yeah, why you think we still doin' it?
The dream is still alive, my nigga, and we're pursuin' it
The money on your head is expired, then we're renewin' it
The plan is not for you to ruin it
The next time I look at your body, I think of viewin' it
Ain't even got enough sense to put two in it
Know I like my backwoods stuffed with Gorilla Glue in it
The hood is like the jungle with a sprinkler, the zoo in it, yeah
From the block to the interstate
Get a couple dollars, watch all of the love disintegrate
Bad enough a nigga gotta deal with the inner hate
95 South, I'm just tryna get a dinner plate
One false move, I'm comin' back in a bag
The prices is right though, I'm comin' back in a Jag
Razor to your cheek, you comin' back with a scab
Lotta thoughts in my mind, I'm runnin' back to the lab (Dayzel)
Audibles be the best plays, I still got a line on the best haze
I get it from the eses
I'm light years ahead of these niggas, I mean decades, what?

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
See these niggas act stupid when the weather get warm
Y'all been lettin' these fuck niggas slide too long
You don't wanna get clapped, I suggest you move on
You could try to come back but my niggas too strong
I'm just tryna get away yo, from the yayo and the hatin' niggas on my block
I'm just tryna avoid the police, see a mill' piece but these niggas won't let me rock
So I load my gun

[Verse 4: Sheek Louch]
Yeah, what'chu think I do this shit for?
Dope money, rap money, dollar on a pick four
Quick draw, gun on me, late night, quick score
Netflix, nah homie, big movie, Pixar
Hood love, born and raised, first unit, fifth floor
Been cool but like that, silverback, jigsaw
Talk less, pay attention, pull-up bar, heavy benchin'
Sheek did a lotta bitches, hatin' niggas, lotta tension
Shoot, shoot for real, for real
Mines go from jail to jail
Lawyers got bail to bail
Yours can't keep it real
We not close, we used to be
This the new me, get used to me
I changed for the better, dawg, truthfully
Inspiration for your kid on what you could be
What you see is what you get, no scrutiny
Instead you wanna follow him, I'm like, "who is he?"
Niggas need to get away yo, for a day yo
No Instagram, I-G, or cable
Just some liquor and some good smoke
And some good smoke
And some good smoke

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
See these niggas act stupid when the weather get warm
Y'all been lettin' these fuck niggas slide too long
You don't wanna get clapped, I suggest you move on
You could try to come back but my niggas too strong
I'm just tryna get away yo, from the yayo and the hatin' niggas on my block
I'm just tryna avoid the police, see a mill' piece but these niggas won't let me rock
So I load my gun
