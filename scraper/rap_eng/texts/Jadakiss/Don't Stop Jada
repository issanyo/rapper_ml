I just need this part right right here Poobs, this part is more important than anything (Look at the dance that go with it)
(Uh) Don't stop Jada, (Uh) fuck y'all haters, (Uh) don't step on my gators (Not the shoe)
Eh-heee (Green Lantern)

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yo, it's too hot, no hammer just two hawks with me
Call me when it's no coke in New York City
Call me when it's no haze in Washington Heights
Crispy hundred to a crackhead for washing a bike
You could get yourself murdered just for squashing a fight
Usually could get away from the narcs in your nike's
I don't give a fuck if you do wrong or do right
Go to Willard catch a [?] do life
I'm out here with these fat asses and this ice
And this money, and these whips nigga rolling a dice
Industry is somewhat like controlling the heist
Couple crackers you'll never meet controlling your life
The other niggas is corns, sworn in pawns
Secret society of devils with no horns
Counting stacks in the back of the villa
With the chrome I'm the 44 caliber killer
Leave your dome right there on the side of your pillow
Nobody is iller, I'm a wolf mixed with a gorilla
Puff a joint while I'm sipping a Miller
On a mink sofa sitting on chinchilla
Every verse deserves a pull back
Listen up I don't represent that bull crap
Every verse deserves a pull back
Listen up I don't represent that bull crap
Love is a good strong hug and a full dap
For some people death is considered a full nap
And I'm anti ringtone, I still move around with the thing holmes
The money's tax free that I bring home
Shout out to the state pens, all of the fed joints
Either the hollow heads or the regular lead joints
Fresher than Easter, still give 50 a feature, yeah even in a recession
I stay happy even in a depression
It ain't safe around me in a session
Niggas better get out and vote or learn a lesson (vote)
And get off your ass and stop stressing
Or just watch the coke rise
Crib on the water, everyday is a boat ride
If you're Tony, guess that must make me Sosa
This is the D-Block, La Cosa Nostra
Devilish bastard, tell niggas to find something to fall back on besides the casket

(This shit is a movie)
Don't stop Jada, fuck y'all haters, don't step on my gators
Ow (Eh-Heee) we going in Poobs, kiss my ass nigga
We coming, fuck what niggas is talking 'bout, one
Green Lantern (It's a fucking invasion you bastards)
