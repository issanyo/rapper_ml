[Intro: Nino Man]
Harlem
Nino Man

[Chorus: Nino Man]
I grew up with nothin', I’m used to not havin' a lot
I came from the struggle, that's why I be grindin’ a lot
I'm from the bottom and workin' my way to the top
This is my story, if a young nigga dancin' to pop

[Verse 1: Nino Man]
All these rappers thinkin' they hype but they no competition
You're not gonna make it, no way, 'til you learn how to shut up and listen
Keep tellin' these niggas to man up ’cause I’m gettin' tired of them bitchin’
Since I'm in the buildin', you all gotta leave 'cause it’s time for eviction
I'm next up, it's on now
Kickin' all the record label doors down
Bitch that I used to like is whores now
But they missed their shot, throw in the skull now
But I'm curvin' now so stop askin'
I'm doin' me so I'm mackin'
I'm from the hood so I'm ratchet
I'm from Harlem not Manhatten
I'm buzzin' now, it's the real fame
Nothin' fake, this the real thing
Bitches tellin' me they wanna settle down wit' me but it's funny 'cause they don't know my real name
Been through a lot and I'm still sane
Body so numb, I don't feel pain
Got some big homies that still bangin',  when that steel bang you gon' feel rain

[Chorus: Nino Man]
I grew up wit' nothin', I'm used to not havin' a lot
I came from the struggle, that's why I be grindin' a lot
I'm from the bottom and workin' my way to the top
This is my story, if a young nigga dancin' to pop
My life is a movie, I swear my life feel like a movie
They watchin' me 'cause I be movin'
Just stick to the side, let me do me
My life is a movie, I swear my life feel like a movie
I'm smokin' shit, line my jacuzzi with bad bitches that wanna do me

Spielberg shit, Scorsese
Movin' that white, all crazy
Hatin' on me 'cause I'm gettin' money, niggas ain't broke they lazy
You got to catch it then you must learn how to stretch it
Too hard for the theater, you might have to go straight to Netflix
I never stress it, y'all niggas know who the best is
In case they forgot, y'all better relay the message
Clip 'em with hallows and they go straight through them vestes
Niggas be frontin' to you, send 'em back to the Essence
Then they believe it, sometimes they don't really need it
By then it's too late 'cause they bleedin'
After you die then we even
Gimmie the Uzi, Scarface, I'm in the jacuzzi
Smokin' a doobie, I wear my life feel like a movie

[Chorus: Nino Man]
I grew up wit' nothin', I'm used to not havin' a lot
I came from the struggle, that's why I be grindin' a lot
I'm from the bottom and workin' my way to the top
This is my story, if a young nigga dancin' to pop
My life is a movie, I swear my life feel like a movie
They watchin' me 'cause I be movin'
Just stick to the side, let me do me
My life is a movie, I swear my life feel like a movie
I'm smokin' shit, line my jacuzzi with bad bitches that wanna do me

[Verse 3: Nino Man]
[?] young, they doubted me
Fuck what you think, I'm proud of me
Look, I'm the truth, don't lie to me
Ain't no guy to me that's as fly as me
It's all facts and that's honestly
My Mobb Deep, I'm like Prodigy
Y'all drive weak, y'all won't salvage me
Now it's time to meet a few calories
'Cause I'm gone, winnin', everything is lookin' authentic
Brand new whip, all tinted
Fresh new kicks, new fitted
I'm so Harlem, I'm so real
My name buzzin' wit' no deal
I be grindin' hard for real
On the road to riches with no will
Nigga could of ended up anywhere
But I gotta go so I'm headed there
It's only one me but I'm everywhere
I be in the hood, you ain't never there
I'ma let 'em see that I spend heat
Show these mothafuckas who I be, let 'em know it's me
Just a young nigga from the streets that could flow the beats
Everyday that grindin' on my piece, felon on my feet

[Chorus: Nino Man]
I grew up wit' nothin', I'm used to not havin' a lot
I came from the struggle, that's why I be grindin' a lot
I'm from the bottom and workin' my way to the top
This is my story, if a young nigga dancin' to pop
My life is a movie, I swear my life feel like a movie
They watchin' me 'cause I be movin'
Just stick to the side, let me do me
My life is a movie, I swear my life feel like a movie
I'm smokin' shit, line my jacuzzi with bad bitches that wanna do me
