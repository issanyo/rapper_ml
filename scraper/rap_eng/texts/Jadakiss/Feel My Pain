[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, ohhh
LOX

[Hook]
Million dollar dreams, fancy cars
Live the life of a movie star
And all these hoes, I done seen 'em all
Hustlin' for change, I can feel your pain
A dope fiend, needle in the vein
I came up but I never change
Just some things I had to rearrange
La-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la, oh

[Verse 1: Sheek]
Hailed as a king soon as my mama water burst
.357 in my girl's Chanel purse
Smokin' a joint, life for what it's worth
Prioritizin' money but my family first
Bottles comin' to me non-stop
Shooter ready to pop
Your bitch better give me top
Pull a whip out then jump on your dick
Diamonds drippin', bitch I love how I'm makin' you sick

[Hook]
Million dollar dreams, fancy cars
Live the life of a movie star
And all these hoes, I done seen 'em all
Hustlin' for change, I can feel your pain
A dope fiend, needle in the vein
I came up but I never change
Just some things I had to rearrange
La-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la, oh

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Told my mother if I die today I lived like a king
I ain't sleep a lot but I lived out my dreams
Came from the streets with the dealers and the fiends
Couple people thought I wouldn't outlive my teens
Now I'm flyin' places, balconies and fireplaces
I ain't shootin' like the Uzi broke
Lookin' clean, eat cuisine with the bougie folks
Got diamonds but I still want rubies though
Classic like the book but we still make a movie though
You know? L.O.X

[Hook]
Million dollar dreams, fancy cars
Live the life of a movie star
And all these hoes, I done seen 'em all
Hustlin' for change, I can feel your pain
A dope fiend, needle in the vein
I came up but I never change
Just some things I had to rearrange
La-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la, oh

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
A lot of niggas get buried over bitches and coke
Straight send us to the source, still I send 'em a toast
A lot of niggas told and get they put in my notes
I can see these niggas broke by the pictures they post
RIP my nigga (?), he in these flows
Say a prayer every night, hope he pass you my note
Ain't no love, my mind made up, I shed my last tear
Street sweepin' these corners made me a cashier
A nigga's swag kept me sack like a quarterback
That type of paper made my ass never wanna rap
Virgin, I had golden eagle kilos all in my lair
I see no evil, no witness, God bless these Cartiers

[Hook]
Million dollar dreams, fancy cars
Live the life of a movie star
And all these hoes, I done seen 'em all
Hustlin' for change, I can feel your pain
A dope fiend, needle in the vein
I came up but I never change
Just some things I had to rearrange
La-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la, oh

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Bullets dispersed soon as the gun rise
Top deck of the villa watchin' the sun rise
As far as the hustle, they can't knock us
All the love came from the sniffers and vein poppers
A nine month run with that boy is a game stopper
But if you got hate in your blood you can't prosper (never)
We all come from the block (D-Block)
Now we sippin' rum punch on the yacht
Live nigga

[Hook]
Million dollar dreams, fancy cars
Live the life of a movie star
And all these hoes, I done seen 'em all
Hustlin' for change, I can feel your pain
A dope fiend, needle in the vein
I came up but I never change
Just some things I had to rearrange
La-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la, oh
