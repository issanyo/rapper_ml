[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
Rahh
We turned up and they knocked down (turn up, turn up)
Feds wan' know how much money we got now
They know we made a few M's off for that black card
They know we killed niggas but can't prove that we shot ya (ha! ha!)
Rahh, they don't make them like us no more (no!)
These two niggas get jailed up, cooperate with the law (dang!)
Uh, my niggas don't do cooperatin' (facts!)
That don't care how much time they facin'?
They do the time, no negotiating
We ain't Nicky Barnes, we ain't giving up no information
I'm Huey Newton, I'm Larry Davis, I'm Pappy Mason
You like Alpo, you helped the government with a few cases

[Chorus: Uncle Murda]

Niggas like me?
They don't make them like that no more

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yeah, hand to hand in that front door service
The ice skate turned into murders (uncle)
For running off at that mouse (ya)
Paperwork will get out the house (get out)
After that they label you
Rats can live and they never should be able to (never)
If you stay, they gon' tear you up in a day or two (tear 'em up)
Catch you sippin' on the wrong block, they will spray at you (Brrrr!)
Gotta stay, so I'm leaving you
Niggas doin' life for some shit they ain't even do
Damn, and it's getting crucial
They ain't makin' niggas like they used to
