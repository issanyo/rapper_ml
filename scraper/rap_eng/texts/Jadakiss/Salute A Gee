{Sheek Louch}
Fuck it Im going in
Yo
Let it bang nigga
We dont call the cops
Certified G nigga riding on these blocks
Ain't no rapper you know that ain't listen to the Lox
Ain't a bitch that you know that ain't on one of our cocks
Squares of that raw, half a G
Big ass guns that Im riding with is half the jeep
Im in your house while you layin there half asleep
Come on your block or whatever and I ain't half as deep
Gettin money as a young'in
Im trying to french kiss older bitches as a kid
They wouldn't let me put my tongue in
Now look what I brung in
Rope on my neck is longer and thicker than the ones we got hung in
Put four fingers up
And tuck your thumbs
Salute the God when you see him or when we shootin the one
This ain't for fun, its a full time job
Little bitches like you is them niggas we rob
Jumpin out the SAAB in the 80s
Bear coat, hotter than 380s
Back then our block was like Haiti
You never know who had it
It took a while to find out who ratted
Black radio playing that "Illmatic"
Im just saying Im a Yonkers nigga
You dont compare us to a barrel, long as you know I ain't no trigger
Bang bang muthafuckas its them D-Block boys
All that skinny jean rappin nigga kill that noise

{Styles P}
Anybody harder they say "No O.G."
Goon spelled backward is "No O.G."
Niggas know I snap like the photo V
Put a bullet in the horse on your polo B
And I come from a block where they clap at
You dont want another hole in your snap back
I got a big ass gun in my back pack
Rob niggas let it ring, ra-ta-tat-tat
Now who wanna get shot where they lats at
I let a blade run across where your traps at
By the way cocksucker where your trap at
Who the shooter he the one im gon clap at
Im a savage muthafucka but im abstract
And im good with the numbers like a NASDAQ
S-dot-P-Dot G-Host
Before rap all I thought about was kilos
Im from D-Block, you know I love C-Notes
And I used to sling sacks of that P tho
Yeah nigga L-O-X
Actin like we from Santos, L-O-S
Put a gun in my P-O-L-O vest
If you try to fuck with us, say "Hello Death"
Cuz you gon die real soon
D-Block, you lookin at some real goons

{Jadakiss}
Still pullin the tech out the dresser
Y'all students of the game, yes I'm a professor
Looking in the mirror, like can I be any fresher?
Niggas'll bench press ya, hate then sweat cha
Yeah, aww then but thats just how the hood be
Work garbage grams ain't moving how they could be
Hustlin backwards not doing what you should be
I could show ya niggas how to do it for a good fee
And I ain't just rappin, I endorse it
The line's right there, you know what happen when you cross it
From the hood, still drink water from the faucet
I borrowed shit, gave shit away and I brought shit
And naw, I ain't with the back and forth shit
I'd rather shoot it out than be going through the court shit
All cause you wanna be us
When all you had to do was salute us when you see us
It dont matter if Im in the Porsche or Prius
You already know that the diamonds is V.V.S
Nine out of 10, the garments is all G.S
If anybody gon bring harm, its gon be us
U pussy and soft, U.P.S
Worse thing they ever coulda did was free us
Now hop on the wave and ride that
L-O-X nigga, you can't divide that
