(Jadakiss)
Know they say real niggas is hard to come by
Last of a dying breed, I'm on the alumni
Spend money, fuck bad bitches, get dumb high
Some get 3 strikes, others get one try
Yeah, we way past the guap
She gon be right here til the casket drop
When the good times roll, when the ratchets pop
Know that I can keep goin' I don't have to stop
Nah, in good hands she'll never worry
Cause, I'm just a legend being legendary
Stand firmly behind ours
And the bars is divine cause I fuck with Divine Bars
