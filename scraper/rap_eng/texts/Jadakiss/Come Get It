[Verse 1:]
Boy, do you know
What you're really asking me for?
If you don't
Then you need to make sure

You really know what you want
(What you want)
Cause I got somethin for ya
That'll blow ya mind

Make you wanna go back in time
And fill me up
(All over again)
Getcha higher than that twenty-twen-twen, yeah

[Chorus:]
I got enough goods to feed the whole world
I got more riches than diamonds and pearls
So for me to get witcha
You need to come get it
Come get it, baby

I got that shit everybody wanna hit
But what I got
Not just anybody can get
If you wanna feel the real
You need to come get it
Come get it, baby

[Verse 2:]
I got the truth
Taste my pudding
And you'll find the proof

It's more for me cause I get to choose
Who I wanna give some of that mmh to
And it tastes as good as it looks

You can market in the burbs
Or in any hood
Give you that glow like you from Hollywood
So if you want it
Take it now
Don't be wishin' you could of later

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I ain't got no need to front
I know what I want
And I'm comin' to get it
Yummy, don't even stunt

When you hear that European horn
Go to the front
It's me blowin that black thing
Blowing a blunt
And I ain't just anybody
I'm somebody

And I don't be at all of 'em, ma
Just some parties
So that train of though that you got
Get rid of it
Cause me hitting it is some what of a privilege

And that ain't real beef
I'm in that's frivolous
Not from DC
But I'll show you what a Wizard is

Talking like you got something wet
Action is louder than words
And I ain't felt nothing yet
The hugging and the kissing is cool
But honestly
I'm bout ready to take a dip in the pool

You done did it
Put your money where your mouth is
And come wit it
And I'ma come get it

[Repeat Chorus x2:]
