[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Dirty money in a duffle bag
Tour money for the IRS
Revolvers for my street niggas
Let them niggas know we did it best
A pound for my hood bitches
Smokin' out the projects, hah
Fast cars and champagne
Raise it up for the L-O-X (L-O-X)

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
I had dimes down the block (Chea)
Finished then I re-upped
Left the weed alone, got my money for a KIA
Got a record deal, thought I could put my feet up
Met executives that I wanted to beat up (haha!)
Had to learn the game, my money is tight
I'm spending harder now these motherfuckers yellin' my name
Don Don, weed ashes on my long john
NFL lookin', white people like 'yo what team he ball on?' (damn!)
9 milli in the glovebox (deah)
You hatin' on us, motherfucka, but they love Lox (L-O-X)
And we ain't on a this mother fucker like the detox (detox)
You big dummy we Red Fox
My nigga (WOOOO!!!)

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Dirty money in a duffle bag
Tour money for the IRS
Revolvers for my street niggas
Let them niggas know we did it best
A pound for my hood bitches
Smokin' out the projects, hah
Fast cars and champagne
Raise it up for the L-O-X (L-O-X)

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Dirty money in a duffle bag
Name ring bells where I hustled at (Ghost)
Knock the work off then I double back
Had a little bit of cash, had to double that (word)
Next thing I know I had work in bubble wrap (haha)
Then I parked a Beamer on a block where I struggled at
And them hood bitches was lovin' that
Champagne in a fast car (drink up)
Exotic weed in a glass jar (D-Block)
Fly clothes, all type of Nikes
Send a kite to my man, tell him what life is like (What up homie?)
When you touch down, we gon' bust down
Forever blessed, yeah raise it up for the LOX

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Dirty money in a duffle bag
Tour money for the IRS
Revolvers for my street niggas
Let them niggas know we did it best
A pound for my hood bitches
Smokin' out the projects, hah
Fast cars and champagne
Raise it up for the L-O-X (L-O-X)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Used to finish a whole joint by a quarter to three (uh-huh)
They threw a nigga off the roof when I was going to re (Whoo!)
I started waiting in the cab until they bought to me (Ahah)
I found the dog food club and moved onto the D (Diesel)
I don't know him I don't serve 'em (nah)
Don't feel right I'ma curve 'em (yup)
I don't waste bullets, I preserve 'em
If the money is ever a penny short, I'ma hurt 'em (Mhmm)
It's the trinity niggas, part three, third sermon (Whoo!)
No matter what, never leave 'til it's all finished (never)
Move right, Commonwealth states off limits (You know)
First you get 'em hooked after that it's all gimmicks
Got the Goyard duffle filled up with all spinach

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Dirty money in a duffle bag
Tour money for the IRS
Revolvers for my street niggas
Let them niggas know we did it best
A pound for my hood bitches
Smokin' out the projects, hah
Fast cars and champagne
Raise it up for the L-O-X (L-O-X)
