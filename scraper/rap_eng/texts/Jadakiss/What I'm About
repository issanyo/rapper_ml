[Hook: Jay-Z Sample]
You already know what I’m about (what I’m about nigga)
You already know what I’m about (what I’m about hey)
You already know what I’m about (what I’m about)
What I’m about (what I’m about), what I’m about (what I’m about hey)

[Verse 1: Jabo]
Y'all know me, roll like a stone don’t need no cold feet
Papa ain’t showed me much but I still keep in touch with the words of a real G
In peace you rest, played with my check
Meet D money, getting K nickels
I’m still repping that west side
This Birmingham, 2-0-5
We so live in this bitch
It’s a open door, can’t break the knob
Don’t come down to this bitch
If you ain’t bout yo paper and know yo job
Got young niggas in foreigns, my little cousin told me this boring
He say Jabo I’m tired of hand to hand, transaction feeling extorted
But we still fight the temptations
Walk around in this Matrix
Got hate coming from all angles
I pray to God that I make it
They say Satan staying next do’
Got my bible and my .380
And that 40 Glock with the scope
Them Chinese choppas under the table
I'm bout money, helping my neighbor
And when I’m killing time I could really rhyme
Beat y'all to the finish line
You was ill advised how I came down
It’s no surprise
I’mma spend it how I’m living
I ain’t seen shit, young niggas poker eyes
In the game, you a lonely guy
And it’s too late for you to run it ‘cus…

[Hook]
You already know what I’m about (what I’m about)
You already know what I’m about (what I’m about)
You already know what I’m about (what I’m about)
What I’m about (what I’m about), what I’m about (what I’m about)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
You know I’m about my money and my family
It’s from Columbia but I get it from Miami
Two things you never do -- don’t try and don’t dare me
Cause you know I’m about that hawk and that swami
Old work, new money
Couple bottles, few hunnies
Heavy smoker, light drinker
Smart mouth, quick thinker
Cut a nigga then pick the shank up
Head cracked then pick the bank up
If it shake then get your anchor
Get your Rollies, get your links up
House shopping, car shopping
Club hopping, bar hopping
Model fucking, star popping
Who we slide with is our option
New Porsche, new Range
I stay the same, you change
Roll another, control the gutter
Sold popcorn, sold butter
Brother’s keeper, keep your brother
Keep it trill and the streets’ll love you
Barrel’s plastic, handle's rubber
Always listen, teach each other
Never borrow, never owe
Heavy work brings heavy dough
If you pull it out, better let it go
What I’m about, you already know nigga

[Hook]
You already know what I’m about (you already know)
You already know what I’m about (you already know)
You already know what I’m about
What I’m about (what I’m about), what I’m about (what I’m about)

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
You already know Thugga bout getting this paper
And if you ain’t back when I’m back, see you later
They see me in that drop, think I played for them Lakers
6' 6" tall ball players is my neighbors
My paper long, my paper grown
My Bentley worth more than your home
Paid cash, I don’t need loans
I ain’t driving nothing that I don’t own (boss)
Still do it big in that Texas
Where them boys bout them checks
Young millionaires out slanging birds
Gotta give them boys their respect
Pushing Raris and Rovers, all out mixing baking soda
Bad bitch toter, stay covered in kush odor
Told mama I’mma blow up
Then went and got my dough up
Mix that Sprite with this four up
Just to make me make this flow up
Papa was a rolling stone so I had to hold my chrome
Kick door your home and hopefully you was gone
Oh you was gone
But that’s way back and I ain’t on that
I made mills rapping bout my life and repping where my home at

[Hook]
You already know what I’m about
You already know what I’m about
You already know what I’m about
What I’m about (what I’m about), what I’m about (what I’m about)
