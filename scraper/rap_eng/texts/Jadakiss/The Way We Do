[Hook: Jihad]

We poppin bottles in the V.I
Tellin shorty roll another one up
We turnin up so they can see how
The way we do when you don't give a fuck


[Verse 1: Jadakiss]

I'm gettin money now
Couple people that used to holla act funny now
Fish bowl stock rims, no 20's now
I'm on my grown man shit I had to dumb it down
It's me and hunny now

We just coastin
She wanna swing through the hood, she from Nostrand
She got a friend that look good, I want both them
The Rose and the sour, just toastin, we in motion

I got the nine chrome
We headed Uptown, dome on the ride home
You can check it out it's all on my iPhone
We on it sometimes, when I'm in my zone, nigga when I'm gone, let's go!


[Hook: Jihad]

We poppin bottles in the V.I
Tellin shorty roll another one up
We turnin up so they can see how
The way we do when you don't give a fuck


[Verse 2: Apache Chief]

You know I'm grindin now
Couple people I thought I trusted actin grimy now
A couple friends are real gems, I keep em shiny now
I ain't ballin but know my money isn't tiny now, we wine and dine em now

Motherfucker I'm crusin
Her ass fat she can sure take a bruisin
She say she faithful but now your lady be choosin
And now you flexin? I think my point has been provin. That shit amusing

I'm goin too hard, got that wood inside of your lady like a lumberyard
She want a deposit inside her, I withdraw my card
These bitches is crazy they'll trick and treat to tie you down
It's Halloweentown, Upstate


[Hook: Jihad]

We poppin bottles in the V.I
Tellin shorty roll another one up
We turnin up so they can see how
The way we do when you don't give a fuck


[Verse 3: Apache Chief]

I'm takin chances now
Fuck anybody who keeping me from advancing now
My haters mad, skirts up, I see you prancin round
We celebratin go tell em to bring them glasses round, bring them dances round

I keep it so cool
I'm student teaching these rappers, sign up for home school
I'm kickin game go tell Maradona he's soul food
Send my best to your lady, oh you ain't know fool? She call me ol dude

I get em too turnt
I bend her ass to a pretzel, I leave it too burnt
I think I heard that she love me bruh I ain't too sure
I told her I just can't settle until I'm well earned, these bitches won't learn


[Hook: Jihad]

We poppin bottles in the V.I
Tellin shorty roll another one up
We turnin up so they can see how
The way we do when you don't give a fuck
