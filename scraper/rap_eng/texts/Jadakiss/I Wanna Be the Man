[Hook: MistaRogers]
I wanna be the man, I wanna be the man
Always had that vision but they didn't understand
I wanna be the man, I came back from a loss
I wanna be the man, so I made myself a boss
I wanna be the man, I wanna be the man
Always had that vision but they didn't understand
I wanna be the man, I came back from a loss
I wanna be the man, so I made myself a boss
I wanna be the man

[Verse 1: MistaRogers]
And I done never changed
I'm dying to live, got me caught off in the game
And you would do the same if you seen the way I ball
They said they your friends but they wanna see you fall
I just want it all, started off with nothing
I meant I used to bag to get the work off of my cousin
And now that same cousin is cousin that I'm fronting
Addicted to the hustle, got me always into something
They told me I'm a fool, keep my ass off in the school
Consider at the time, I ain't think that shit was cool
I got a double 30 from my nigga Trey Smoove
And I sold that shit for 50 and I work my way in school
I'm tryna bust a move, yo that shit was fast
If I stayed out all night, I could prolly make a stash
On my mama, gon' be tripping, out there looking for my ass
If I come home with this cash and she probably won't be mad

[Hook: MistaRogers]
I wanna be the man, I wanna be the man
Always had that vision but they didn't understand
I wanna be the man, I came back from a loss
I wanna be the man, so I made myself a boss
I wanna be the man, I wanna be the man
Always had that vision but they didn't understand
I wanna be the man, I came back from a loss
I wanna be the man, so I made myself a boss
I wanna be the man

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
But I'mma do it right
And I know that it ain't gonna happen overnight
I came up with the plan, it's time to execute
Never pull your burner out if you ain't gonna shoot
Never fuck with niggas doing, I'm just doing what I do
If the work is good then I know it's gonna move
I wanna be the man, so that's what I'mma be
Can't even imagine what I'm really tryna see
Can't house an opportunity, I'm tryna find the key
You know I'm the plug, if you tryna find the D
Get down with a real nigga, you should sign to me
When it come to selling drugs, I got a bachelors degree

[Hook: MistaRogers]
Cause I wanna be the man, I wanna be the man
Always had that vision but they didn't understand
I wanna be the man, I came back from a loss
I wanna be the man, so I made myself a boss
I wanna be the man, I wanna be the man
Always had that vision but they didn't understand
I wanna be the man, I came back from a loss
I wanna be the man, so I made myself a boss
I wanna be the man
