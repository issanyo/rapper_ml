In a New York minute (Whoo-oooo)

(In a New York, New York, New York, New York)

[Verse 1 - French Montana]
You can get your neck broke, face cracked, laid flat
And give everything that you made back, 8 clap
Make a sunvisor out ya wavecap
Pray that New York Minute'll bring Mase back
Shame that Remy took 8 flat, you know the game wack
And every last rapper here tryna bring the name back
It ain't rap, niggas better stay strapped
Or you could call the stick-up boys, try to get your chain back
(In a New York minute)
They thought the game was over
When B.I.G. died, then the homie Hov took it over
(In a New York minute)
They shot Pac 5 times
Years later, them boys took Shyne
(In a New York minute)
That ain't even the least
Akon signed the hottest nigga in the streets
We gave swagger to the game
Still and all, everything can change

[Verse 2 - Lil' Cease]
New York, shit's rotten in the Big Apple
Nicky barnes got his whole shit shackled
Play like a New York Giant then you can get tackled
The Big Apple is a story
He said let his son dry, bag it up in 40
Broke a little dime out and mixed it up with all the
Haha, and I'm from Brooklawn
Where niggas even look wrong, niggas get hooked on
(In a New York minute)
The home of The Lox (D-Block)
Even in LA they killed BIG Pop
(In a New York minute)
They killed Sean Bell
And I still think they killed John Gotti in the cell
(In a New York minute)
Where Pac got shot
Waitin' on Gutta, we just got back Roc
(In a New York minute)
We'll bring New York back
Drop Hypnotize, then see how New York act

[Verse 3 - Mic Geronimo]
Nigga you can get ya stash took, cuff, booked
Waitin' in the bulb, and all of this over niggas who been talkin'
Rob while ya walkin' and cash ya check
But get the chain and the piece took from off ya neck
From the coupe to the coffin, laying in the morgue
Kuz envious nioggaz didn't get enough from extortion
Lost in the jungle
Tears over rappers who died like Freaky Tye, Big L, and Stack Bundles
(In a New York minute)
Shit, rappers ain't hot no more
Jay don't even fuck with Fox no more
(In a New York minute)
Yeah, what you never thought of was the Eastcoast dyin'
These other niggas get more love
(In a New York minute)
Label execs turning to rich ass junkies
Fuckin' the same moneys
(In a New York minute)
Niggas who forgot about
I spit 16 like Mikey bringin' the chopper out

(In a New York minute, minute)

[Verse 4 - N.O.R.E.]
So fix ya face when you speak of the Mecca, from Tribeca
The left rack, rock a mad hat, they expect that
I rep that, respect that, you can get sent back
Your jaw left on the sidewalk wit' a wet back
I'm a chef with the cocaine cookies, make 'em look pretty
Show you on a DVD with Cocaine City
Yo, Fat Cat, Pappy Mason, 'Preme nigga, my borough
Money Bagz, Chad, Lamar Odom owns my borough
(In a New York minute)
It's like we the most thorough
Orange tops, blue tops, even sold green and yellow
(In a New York minute)
In a New York minute
I'mma rep New York until I finish
(In a New York minute)
Don't use no gimmicks
Catch me on the block drinkin' New York Guiness
(In a New York minute)
Makin' New York spinach
I done did a bid, did a New York sentence

[Verse 5 - Jadakiss]
You could get your wig clapped, kidnapped, bitch-slapped
A 2 to 4 could turn into a 6 flat, if that
C-4 to your moms front door, gift-wrapped
Whole fanbase could start thinkin' that your shit's wack
You could be at the gas station and get ya whip jacked
Get yapped, pay a nigga bread, get ya shit back
Right back, everything could change, just like that
Get pulled over on your way bringin' that white back
(In a New York minute)
Rappers stopped sellin'
Kim did a year and a day for not tellin'
(In a New York minute)
Fox went deaf in one ear too, shortly after that she did a year or two
(In a New York minute)
I beat the case, not enough evidence
Get ready to see a black President
(In a New York minute)
You can download a whole album
Now you see where these niggas get their style from
