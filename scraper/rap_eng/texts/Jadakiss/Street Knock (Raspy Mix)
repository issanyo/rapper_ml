Touch my cheddar feel my beretta
Touch my cheddar feel my beretta
Touch my cheddar feel my beretta
I be smoking trees in Belize when they found me
I be smoking trees in Belize when they found me
I be smoking trees in Belize when they found me

[Verse 1 - Jadakiss]
Riding round that hoopy and its on that 2-3
It aint hard to find me, Im wherever that loot be
I be smoking trees in Belize with a mommy
I was on the block selling peas when they signed me
Roll out and spark it, work back in the market
Sour kush haze, every, everything xcept chocolate
Im constantly raiding stack whatever Im seeing
Patiently just waiting for that Bentley SUV-ing
House shopping onlineing, hate the fact that Im shinning
Feel the back of that 9 if you tryna run off with the consignment
Stop you out in the ayaz stop you out in d browns
Do it for the hood and niggas in the penal
You know who Im down with, what I move around with
They aint in the building, but they got the building surrounded
All I do is wait, cause I aint got time to count it
And the city is mine, aint no fucking doubt about it

Touch my cheddar feel my beretta
Touch my cheddar feel my beretta
Touch my cheddar feel my beretta
I be smoking trees in Belize when they found me
I be smoking trees in Belize when they found me
I be smoking trees in Belize when they found me

[Verse 2: ASAP Rocky]
God damn it I'm a genius, swagga is the meanest
Weird green hair chicks from venus on my penis
Twisting up our fingers, you know who my team is
Starch em up and fold em then we treat them like them cleaners
Used to push the Jag stolen tags, scrape the serial
Mouth rose, top row full of gold material
88 back bass bumping through your stereo
Chicken noodle soup and mixing soda with the cereal
White like milk got beige like a Cheerio
Pancakes and purple syrup and my breakfast is complete
New Black Scale shit that complement that fleece
Reeboks and red-bottoms straight from Swizzy on my feet
We some billionaire boy in some Billionaire Boys Club
Plus probably push a 'Gatti that's the billionaire's toy huh
Whoa kimosabe I’m in Junya Watanabe
Murakami or Versace and Givenchy on your boy, huh?

[Swizz Beats over hook]

Touch my cheddar feel my beretta
Touch my cheddar feel my beretta

[Verse 3: Swizz Beatz]
Haters they can't stop me listen to ASAP Rocky
Walk into the club and bitches say I'm cocky
Walkin' through the club and bitches say I'm cocky
Walkin' through the club and bitches say I'm cocky
Chill back when I'm laid back, sit back and I'm way back
Everybody better stay back, bitch don't say that
Back Back and I’m business, came back and I’m kicks it
Niggas wanna… can I get a witness?
Shit man I’m on fly, 'bout to rule the sky
Basquiats on my wall, Goddamn I'm fly
Keith Harings and all that, Picassos and all that
Rembrandts you name it, bitch I got all that
Wrapped around my skrilla, came back and I’m illa
Bitch asked me my color, I told that bitch Vanilla

[Outro] x3

Back back in back back in back back
Bitch I'm the One
