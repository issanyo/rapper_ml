[Intro]
Uh, uh-huh, yeah
Uh, uh-huh, yeah
It's all about the Benjamins, baby
It's all about the Benjamins, baby

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Now, what y'all wanna do?
Wanna be ballers, shot callers, brawlers
Who be dippin' in the Benz with the spoilers
On the low from the Jake in the Taurus
Tryin' to get my hands on some Grants like Horace
Yeah, livin' the raw deal
Three course meals: spaghetti, fettuccine, and veal
But still, everything's real in the field
And what you can't have now, leave in your will
But don't knock me for tryin' to bury
Seven zeros over in Rio Di Janeiry
Ain't nobody's hero, but I wanna be heard
On your Hot 9-7 every day, that's my word
Swimmin' in women with they own condominiums
Five plus five's, who drive Millenniums
It's all about the Benjamins, what
I get a fifty pound bag of Euk for the mutts
Five carats on my hands with the cuts
In something European chromed out with a clutch, what

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I wanna hold figures, fuck being a broke nigga
Drinkin' malt liquor, drivin' a broke Viga
I'm with Mo' sippers, watched by gold diggers
Rocking Girbaud denims with gold zippers
Lost your touch, we kept ours, poppin' Cristals
Freakin' the three-quarter reptiles
Enormous cream, forest green Benz jeep
For my team so while you sleep I'ma scheme
We see through, that's why nobody never gon' believe you
You should do what we do, stack chips like Hebrews
Don't let the melody intrigue you, 'cause I leave you
I'm only here for that green paper with the eagle

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
I'm strictly tryin' to cop those colossal-sized Picasso's
And have papi flip coke outside Delgado's
Tienda, with cash flowin' like Sosa
And a Latin chick transportin' in the chocha
Stampedin' over, pop Mo's, never sober
Flexin' Range Rovers dealin' weight by Minnesota
Avoidin' narcs with camcorders and Chevy Novas
Stash in the building with this chick named Willona
From Daytona, when I was young I wanted to bone her
But now I only hit chicks who win beauty pageants
Trickin' and takin' me skiin' at the Aspens, uh
Gangsta mental, stay poppin' Cristal
Pack a black pistol in the Ac' coupe that's dark brown
Pinkie ringin', gondolas with the man singin'
Italian music down the river with your chick clingin'
To my bizzalls, player, you mad false
Actin' hard when you as pussy as RuPaul's

[Hook]
It's all about the Benjamins, baby
It's all about the Benjamins, baby
Now, what y'all wanna do?
It's all about the Benjamins, baby
Wanna be ballers, shot-callers
It's all about the Benjamins, baby
Brawlers, who be dippin' in the Benz with the spoilers
It's all about the Benjamins, baby
On the low from the Jake in the Taurus

[Verse 4: Lil' Kim]
Uh, uh, what the blood clot
Wanna bumble with the Bee, huh?
Bzzz, throw a hex on the whole family
Dressed in all black like The Omen
Have your friends singin', "This is for my homie"
And you know me from makin' niggas so sick
Floss in my Six, with the 'Lex on the wrist
If it's murder, you know she wrote it
German Ruger for yo' ass, bitch, deepthroat it
Know you wanna feel the womb 'cause it's platinum-coated
Take your pick, got a firearm you shoulda toted, suck a dick
All that bullshit you kick, player-hatin' from the sidelines
Get your own shit, why you ridin' mine?
I'm a Goodfella kinda lady
Stash 380's in Mercedes, Puffy, hold me down, baby!
Only female in my crew and I kick shit like a nigga do
Pull the trigger too, fuck you!

[Verse 5: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uh, uh, uh, I been had skills, Cristal spills
Hide bills in Brazil, about a mill', the ice grill
Make it hard to figure me, liquor be kickin' me
In my asshole; undercover, Donnie Brasco
Left my East Coast girl the Bentley to twirl (uh-huh)
While my West Coast shorty push the chrome 740
Rockin' Redman and Naughty, oh, where my kitty cat?
Half a brick of yay in the bra where her titties at
And I'm livin' that for life, we push weight
Fuck the state pen, fuck hoes at Penn State
Listen close, it's Francis, the Praying Mantis
Attack with the MAC, my left hand spit
Right hand grip on the whip for the smooth getaway
Player haters, get away or my lead will spray
Squeeze off 'til I'm empty, don't tempt me
Only to Hell I send thee, all about the Benjis, what

[Outro]
It's all about the Benjamins, baby
It's all about the Benjamins, baby
It's all about the Benjamins, baby
It's all about the Benjamins, baby
It's all about the Benjamins, baby
It's all about the Benjamins, baby
It's all about the Benjamins, baby
It's all about the Benjamins, baby
