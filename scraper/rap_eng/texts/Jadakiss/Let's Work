[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Brown liquor and my homies like to smoke a lot
Burners everywhere fuck around and you getting shot
Let’s work, let’s work
Shorty got a body like crazy I don’t care if her ass fake
Get money and stay quiet for God’s sake
Do your dirt all by your lonely!

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Wrist game neckpiece drip to the floor
I don’t know her but she look like ready to score
No beef but my niggas is ready for war
I put that merch in the bag like I’m leaving on tour
45 and this nickel plate
I don’t walk unless my money and my liquor straight
I’m too busy woodie I ain't got no time to hate
You ain’t see a million dollars let me demonstrate
Money counter, money counter
Point blank range head trey pounder
Took a minute for me grow up
This a different kind of blow up
Make them hating niggas throw up

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Brown liquor and my homies like to smoke a lot
Burners everywhere fuck around and you getting shot
Let’s work, let’s work
Shorty got a body like crazy I don’t care if her ass fake
Get money and stay quiet for God’s sake
Do your dirt all by your lonely!

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Do my dirt all by my lonely
Told my homies I’ll let them know when to phone me
Headed out of town where none of these niggas know me
Playing beenie man all about romie
In them big fat sister Naomi
Never talk about money nigga and not show me
Lets work, the next work can triple the net worth
In the mix when the flip done
Shorty got her ass and her tits done
Why I give a shit if her pussy wet and your dick cum
That’s your business I’m thinking about my income
I’m mister all that and then some
Im mister fall back or red rum
50 drum shots to your head will make the feds come
Lets work, the expert
Is giving the best work you gon be the next merc
Nigga!

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Brown liquor and my homies like to smoke a lot
Burners everywhere fuck around and you getting shot
Let’s work, let’s work
Shorty got a body like crazy I don’t care if her ass fake
Get money and stay quiet for God’s sake
Do your dirt all by your lonely!

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Me I do my dirt on the dolo that’s how I roll though
Uppercut jabs and bolos yeah I throw those
Its time to lean on a mark
I’m bout to get the 2017 just to park it
Still put your spleen on the carpet
Get rid of that thing before the narcs hit
We blowing heavy going hard on the yak
From a place to make it out is even hard than crack (Y-O)
If I turn around on ya niggas pardon my back
It’s the adrenaline rush when I’m discharging the mac
The pain goes way it just hurts
Playtime is over so lets work

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Brown liquor and my homies like to smoke a lot
Burners everywhere fuck around and you getting shot
Let’s work, let’s work
Shorty got a body like crazy I don’t care if her ass fake
Get money and stay quiet for God’s sake
Do your dirt all by your lonely!
Brown liquor and my homies like to smoke a lot
Burners everywhere fuck around and you getting shot
Let’s work, let’s work
Shorty got a body like crazy I don’t care if her ass fake
Get money and stay quiet for God’s sake
Do your dirt all by your lonely!
