[Hook 1: Seth Marcel, Jadakiss]
This is for my dogs, hustlers, and Hardcore (let's go)

This is for my dogs, hustlers, and Hardcore

[Verse 1: Seth Marcel]
Hey yo, Marcel squeeze on dudes like a python
Hey yo wait a minute, is this motherfucking mic on?
(both) Hardcore
Ya'll Need to watch me bett'a
I'm like arthur fonzarelli son you [potse? weather?]
I flow sick no shit, we can do whatever
This training day done this means chess not checkers
Jada and Marcel, haters like "Aw hell"
When's the last time you seen a two man cartel?
No ghost writer, I compose wicked ass flows
You too soft like the petals on a rose
You can wear a bullet proof suit that goes from your neck to your toes
My peeps aim at nasal holes
When it comes to violence I'm really opposed
But y'all never respect words till the flesh is exposed
You know what to bring to the ass whoopin'
A wheelchair and somebody that don't mind pushing

[Hook 2: Seth Marcel, Jadakiss]
This is for my dogs, hustlers, and Hardcore (let's go)
Raw to the core hard like reservoir dogs (yea)
Get up, stand up, (Come on!)
Come on throw your hands up for Seth Marcell nigga' (let's go)
This is for my dogs, hustlers, and Hardcore (let's go)
Raw to the core hard like reservoir dogs (what up )
Get up, stand up, (Come on!)
Come on throw your hands up for Jadakiss, nigga'

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Kiss is a hardcore nigga in general (uh huh)
Because I slap you 5 and still put 10 in you
And I'm still in the hood, right there Glockin' 'em
Shorty got the pack, but I'm right there watchin' him
I can't wait for one of y'all faggot niggers to come through
So I can let the 40 cal stop a nigga's oxygen
Kids in the microwave, baby mother in the oven
After we make lovin'. Now that's what I call thuggin'
Some of us is out here
Some is in the pen now
Bundles caught 60, Sacks caught 10 now
One nigga violate they all could get it
Burning up in the old jail the walls are sweating
Find your way over to the D block, get some heat
Niggas gotta wet they mattresses to get some sleep
Kiss flow is some brain food for you lame dudes
You change the game don't let the game change you

Hook 1: Seth Marcel, Jadakiss]

[Verse 3: Seth Marcel]
My style is brainiac heavy metal
I like my tracks semi-raw just like my broads and touch of [?]
Stop MCs like to much clutch and not enough pedal
I'm southern moonshine you Amaretto
You're to soft to brawl black
I seen the headline now: Fake nigga knocked out by small cat
That's with the hands, I ain't even talking about guns
That's another story called "how your kids get trust funds"
Unorthodox technique makes me unique
Your rhyming is weak
It sounds like you ain't rhyme in a week
Selling woof tickets about how you cock and shoot
Probably wouldn't shoot your cock in a prostitute
Always talking all tough in your hooks and bars
Got bodyguards because you always getting hooked in bars
I ain't a thug but I ain't sweet
I know two things:
How to get rid of you and how to measure 6 feet
