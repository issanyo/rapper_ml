[Intro - Jadakiss] (Mario)
(Baby you should let me love you, let me love you)
Ah-ha! Scott Storch! Did it again baby!
(Baby you should let me love you)
(You should let me love you, let me love you, let me love you)
T.I.! Mario! Jada! 3rd Street!
(Baby you should let me love you)
(You should let me love you, let me love you, let me love you)
D-Block! Trap Muzik! Double R!
(Baby you should let me love you)
(You should let me love you, let me love you, let me love you)
This is the remix!
(Baby you should let me love you)

[Verse - Jadakiss]
Just relieve your stress (relax)
Chill your ring finger and freeze ya chest
Cop you the new Beemer, the beads is next
And even though it's a want I need the sex
I hope it's just insecurity
Cause I know she feeling me
Digging the growth and the maturity
But I got hard luck, cause honey keep keeping her guards up
So I'm just trying to even the odds up
And that part sucks to have to keep going back in on her
When she know that I been on her
Since back in the days in Manhattan after the matinee
When she just happened to wave
That's when I knew she had the right shine (right shine)
And the right mind (right mind)
It's just on me to catch her at the right time (right time)
When I get her I'm a grab her by the wrist
Pull her close to me, hug her and tell her this

[Hook - Mario]
Baby you should let me love you, let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be

[Verse - Mario]
Baby I just don't get it, do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smell the perfume, the make up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories you know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, stick around and I just don't know why
(If I was you man) Baby you'd!
(Never worry bout) What I'd do
(I'd be coming home) Back to you, every night doing you right
(Your the type of woman) Deserves good things
(Fist full of diamonds) Hand full of rings
(Baby you're a star) I just want to show you

[Hook]

[Bridge - Mario]
Baby you should let me love you, let me love you
Baby you should let me love you
You should let me love you, let me love you
Baby you should let me love you
You should let me love you, let me love you
Baby you should let me love you
You should let me love you, let me love you
Baby you should let me love you

[Verse - T.I.]
Don't you wanna cruise avenues in a ride wit a pair of shoes
Shining like a diamond sitting high with raised latitude
Heh, listen baby I could change your attitude
You chilling with the king you ain't dealing with them rapper dudes
Hey keep it real, kick it with me, is what you'd rather do
I was popping before you, gonna be the same after you
I ain't gon chase you, I'd rather replace you
In case you wondered, I'm stuntin and way major
If the ice don't matter, and the money don't phase you
Cars don't impress you, I bet the sex'll amaze you
Look you don't want to past the chance (hey!)
Spend the summer in the bottom half of france
Don't be alarmed I don't mean no harm
I'll help you before I hurt you, I'm trying to rebirth you
I wanna love you, I ain't just have to nail you
You already know I can show you
Better than I can tell you

[Hook]

[Bridge] w/ Mario ad-libs
