[Intro]
This is the feature presentation

[Verse 1: Audrey Rose]
It's always all about ya
The world revolves around ya
You swear I can't breathe without ya, without ya

I would believe almost anything that you would say to me
I was a slave to your every word

[Pre-Hook: Audrey Rose]
I admit that you had this control on me
You would take away my vision, I couldn't see
I just told myself that were the one for me
Had to let you go, had to let you go
Man it felt this for years, an eternity
Got this smile on my face but internally
I just wanted it to end, no more you and me
Had to let you go, baby

[Hook: Audrey Rose]
You used to be my nigga
I used to be your ride
I used to be your number one yeah
You said it before, lies
You used to be my

[Verse 2: Audrey Rose]
My baby, so crazy
Step back, reverse, 180
I woke up feeling real crazy
Sorta like faded
Now I see so clear
This couldn't go on forveer
There's no way that we could be together

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Key word, used to, I'm just being truthful
I do what I want though, I don't need no excuse to
The pain is probably similar to a tooth pull
But life goes on and someone better will choose you
Started  off short arguments then we fought long
Started out, even had me smoking Newport longs
Tried to keep it in-house, but people caught on
Though it was for life, we both thought wrong
Rock on your finger, that's still a 101
Fun while it lasted. big things under sun
Love feels good, hurts when the love is done
Used to be your nigga, you used to be my number one

[Bridge: Audrey Rose]
We fell to pieces
I still can't believe it
Looking back I remember You promised me forever
The bone we had is severed
Oh baby you used to be my nigga
I used to be your number one yeah

[Hook]
