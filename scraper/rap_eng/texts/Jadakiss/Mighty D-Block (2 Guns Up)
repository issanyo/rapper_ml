[Intro: Jadakiss]
Yeah, D-Block
Everywhere we go-oh, people wanna know-oh
Who we arrrre, so we tell them
This is D-Block, mighty mighty D-Block

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yo, the revolve' or the mati's cool
Knife game like Daddy Cool's, since Bally Shoes
This is real life street shit, truest and the deepest
Known niggas that go to jail just to get they teeth fixed
Think I give a fuck what you herbs say?
When I got the nigga that you trying to be watching my wordplay
Now everybody wanna be 'Pac
Till they ass really get popped and they die on the third day
The Desi's got a beautiful ring
I can hit any one of y'all, options a beautiful thing
Body is finished, maybe they can save the tooth
Call me Kiss or call me the black Babe Ruth
That many hits -- fuck that, that many bricks
D-Block -- that many niggas, gats to your lips
My dope is two toned, but I had to change my spot
Cause it turned into a drug free school zone

[Hook]
[Jadakiss] J.A.D.A
I'm top 5, dead or alive
And that's just off one LP

[J-Hood] Jae Hood
[Styles P] Two guns up
[J-Hood] All I know is bitches and money, grams and guns
[Styles P] Here's why they call me the Ghost

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Yo, I don't give a fuck about pull out, cock back
Spin a motherfucker out, empty his chest
Leave your motherfucking whip a mess
All over the dashboard, in backseat pieces of flesh
Send niggas to the grave with they face half gone
Stomach ripped open, the beef back on
That nigga Sheek rude, I'll spit in your food
Tell the women in ya family to suck my dick
No respect, fuck that -- I'll murder you quick
Mad weapons in the trunk, bitch -- take your pick
Stick a grenade up under your fender
Stick a pineapple bomb in ya blender, I don't care about you
You say fuck Sheek Louch? Well, fuck you too
Your father, your mother, the hole you came through
Niggas don't learn till they're kerosene-d out
Lighter to their face, they'll spit gasoline out
You want me dead, I'm right here -- do it bitch
Make me bleed till I'm motherfucking fluid-less
I ain't new at this and don't give a fuck about you
Sheek'll run up and smack the shit out you
I live this shit, it's never gon' stop
Open niggas' face with a octopus top
Face all ripped up, catch me on the block
Shells all loaded up, catch me wit the Glock
Pussy motherfuckers don't want no beef
Trip niggas down to their platinum teeth
Chase you in the house with the all black heat
Leave you just boxers and slippers on your feet
I talk reckless; I really want the coke and the money
But I'll settle for your necklace
D-Block

Jadakiss
Everywhere we go-oh, people wanna know-oh
Who we arrrre, so we tell them
This is D-Block, mighty mighty D-Block

[Verse 3: J-Hood]
I grew up as a young dude, chilling wit them old cats
Couldn't cop crack so I had to slang Prozac
Fuck being broke, I'm trying to cop a tan four
Trap you up like niggas get Pussy in The Sopranos
You really want beef? I'm busting the Tec
I'll hit you up in the park while you're doing your sets
It's (Jadakiss: D-Block) (yeah yeah y'all!)
You can't get no streeter, nigga
I'm nice wit the hands but I'm better wit the heater
Old school style -- stash haze in my sock
I'll bust at you and turn your Ac' Jeep to a drop
You niggas talking like y'all can't get stuck up
I ain't an icon but y'all will still get fucked up

[Verse 4: Styles P]
As we continue on, your hood you finish
Write a suicide note and get a window on
Nigga, that's the type of shit we on
Redrum Redrum -- spin it back like a Missy song
Take a cold heart to twist your mom
But it's wintertime, shotty under the snorkle
Will flip when it's dinner time
Strange days without Angela Bassett
Middle of the hood, niggas handling plastic
Gotta watch ya head and not get popped with lead
And watch ya bread, not get popped by Feds
Anywhere we gonna be in the hood
With the burners and the hawks, nigga, being the hood

Jadakiss
Everywhere we go-oh, people wanna know-oh
Who we arrrre, so we tell them
This is D-Block, mighty mighty D-Block
