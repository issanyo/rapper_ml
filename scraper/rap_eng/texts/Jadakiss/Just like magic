[Intro]
Gyal move up yuh body, captivate mi
Gyal mi love how yuh dweet
Every move weh yuh mek gyal yuh body it a speak
Mi want it pon repeat

[Hook] x 2 Mavado:
You're just like magic
The way you do yuh trick
The way yuh body turn and the way yuh body twist
Like magic, the way yuh move yuh hips
Yea that yea

Mavado:
Love it when you on the floor
And do your thing for a while
Move that you got to show
Girl you drive me wild
And if you get on the pole
You know that I won't mind
So lets jet off this coast
And leave this place behind

Fast or slow pick up the tempo
The way she a wine is like a go-go
One thing for certain
One thing for sure
My girl you a wine like a pro

Fast or slow tun up the tempo
Love how you a go and a go
And mi seh thing for sure, a this mi know

[Hook] x 2

Jadakiss:

Yo I can't explain it’s confusing
From what I understand is like your an optical illusion
The way you do your tricks
The way your body moving
And then you disappear
You win some, you lose some
We don’t need a tribe
Together we a two some
Love moves mountains
Lets see if we can move some
I just know I got a habit
And I ain’t ain’t superstitious but it, but it feels like magic

[Hook] x 2

Mavado:

Love it when you rock it slow
And move it on the beat
You know when the night is done
With you I wanna live
I love the way you body talk
Body talking to me
Now listen carefully
Cause my body is gonna speak

Fast or slow pick up the tempo
The way she a wine is like a go-go
One thing for certain
One thing for sure
My girl you a, my girl

Fast or slow tun up the tempo
Love how u a go and a go
And this a one thing for sure
A this mi know

Hook x 2
