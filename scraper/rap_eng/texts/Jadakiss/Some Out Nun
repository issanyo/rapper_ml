You can’t make nothing out of nothing (out of nothing)

Gotta get some cash (gotta get some cash)
Don’t need no n*gga for shit ain’t even gonna ask (ain’t even gonna ask)
Cuz a n*gga will leave you broke down on your last (down on your last)
Thought that’s your man (thought that’s your man)
Thought he was your man (thought he was your man)
