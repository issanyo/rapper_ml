[Intro: Ne-Yo & Jadakiss]
Right by my side
HA-HAH! Uh-huh (Yeah)
E. Hudson, Jadakiss (Hey), Ne-Yo
I think it's me and you tonight ma, lets go (Uh, uh-huh)
You see every good woman needs a thug
You see every good woman needs a thug

[Verse One: Jadakiss]
Go baby, you so wavy
And I ain't never felt this way 'bout no lady
Considerin goin half with you on yo' baby
Somethin about you, makin me go crazy
Know if I ain't soured up, I'm so hazy
Me and you on the same page, so amazin
Need your love girl, so many ways
And you could only hold in out for so many days
And, got enough points to score but you shavin
Hell yeah I'm anxious, but you cravin
Time keep flyin, I'mma keep tryin
Bottom line, I need your L-O-V-I-N
Come on!!!

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Yeah I made no mistake, right by my side
Lil' mama that's your place, keep holdin me down (Hey)
And you can help me spend this cake, right by my side
Ride with me, all I need is you right by my side

[Verse Two: Jadakiss]
He such a small fella, to recognize the Mason Martin Margiela
What could I tell her
Man I swear you got to see her to believe her
Then maybe you could understand why I need her
Besides her bein a diva she wasn't bothered by the chiba
Zodiac sign was a libra
Definetly a keeper, I just wanna put her in a sleeper then fall out underneath her
Wake up, take a shower, then get deeper
Juice up get some power and then freak her
After the feedback then I could G Mack
But it's somethin about her love makin me need that, come on!

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Yeah I made no mistake, right by my side
Lil' mama that's your place, keep holdin me down
And you can help me spend this cake, right by my side
Ride with me, all I need is you right by my side

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
When the drama comes my way (Way)
Long as I got you, girl it's nothing
Baby, it's nothing - I'm good
When these streets, girl, come what may (what may)
Shorty, we do what we do, so it's nothing
Baby girl, your love is something I need

[Verse Three: Jadakiss]
Yo, they say every good woman needs a thug
I totally agree, that's why I need your love (yep)
And I can't help it, if I'm selfish
Cause I need your love and nobody else's
Startin to taste it, pardon the bracelet (pardon)
Chance of a lifetime and I can't waste it
If being beautiful was a test, should've aced it
Her skin is flawless, her hair is waist length
Hi I'm Jason, ma I'm patient-ly waitin for us to have relations
Kissin me is just history in the makin
Squeezin and huggin I need your lovin, come on!!!

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Yeah I made no mistake, right by my side
Lil' mama that's your place, keep holdin me down
And you can help me spend this cake, right by my side
Ride with me, all I need is you right by my side

[Outro: Jadakiss]
Bounce! Bounce! I think we got one what you think?
Bounce!
