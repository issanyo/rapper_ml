(Matt Chris)
I'm so for sure
It ain't on the low
But quiet though
I got this yo
This comes oo
So natural
Super natural
Ain't no practice oo

Verse 1 (Matt Chris)
Been Fresh to Death way before your diapers
There hands side to side like they wind sheild wipers
Chant black diamond don't care if y'all like us
Short visits like we out at rikers
Tour 8 legs shit I call it spider
Mic no chord but I'm still up wired
Light lighters up hold up your lighters
It's night ignite it up
Hold up your fire
Take me take me higher blew 90k prior
Aspire to inspire to whatever you desire
Provider get hired at times ghost writer
Glider with fire something like I'm ghost writer
Black Benz white bitch back side wider
Fly attire make niggas retire
4 lanes hydroplane whose the driver
MC that's me thought you was wiser

Fresh in the club walk through the door
Chicks winding and grinding on the floor
I ain't poor no more cause my swagger or
I'm so for sure they get on the floor
I'm so for sure get on the floor
I'm so for sure get on the floor
I'm so for sure Get on the floor
I'm so for sure girl give me some more

Verse 2 (Jadakiss)
Me I'm a bidoss
4 door pidorsche
How you gonna win if you never took a lidoss
Summers in the feds
Summers up nidorth
Either for a sale or blowing a niggas wig off
Strength is in the numbers one move we all move
On the low OT moving that dog food
Bitches in the suite pissy drunk they all nude
Louis V hightops suede and they all blue
Trues and a thermal
The ozie will turn you
Playing games like the rules don't concern you
Sparkles on the bottles you don't move they will burn you
Outsider but I make moves internal
I don't do the slots
Might hit the dice
Hoes all on me when the light hit the ice
If it ain't the ratchet got to be the knife
Momma say it's foolish I say it's the life

Fresh in the club walk through the door
Chicks winding and grinding on the floor
I ain't poor no more cause my swagger or
I'm so for sure they get on the floor
I'm so for sure get on the floor
I'm so for sure get on the floor
I'm so for sure Get on the floor
I'm so for sure girl give me some more

Fresh in the club walk through the door
Chicks winding and grinding on the floor
I ain't poor no more cause my swagger or
I'm so for sure they get on the floor
I'm so for sure get on the floor
I'm so for sure get on the floor
I'm so for sure Get on the floor
I'm so for sure girl give me some more
