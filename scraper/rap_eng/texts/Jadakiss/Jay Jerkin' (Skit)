Yo yo yo yo
Emcee's catch cold feet when i hold heat
Creap to a low beat and kay slay like street sweep
Albums of 2000 poundin' muthafuckas like no more public housin'
Jada levelin' niggas to the groundin'
Buckin' in your spouse'n
Bringin' drama like osama and breakin' up thousands
Fuck the game
The game wants us
We clip so hard souls of our enemy's taunt us
To pull more triggers fuckit
I grab my gunz and buck'it
Like nas u gotta love'it when i touch it
On the mic jada flow toughest
Remember that

*(girls singing)*

Jada jada jada kiss
Where have u been and what is this?
How many times have i told ya i'm not ya bitch
If u like flirting with death, then here, go slit your wrists

*(jadakiss)*

Bitch, fuck you
