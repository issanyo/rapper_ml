I give all of ya'll few in the dome
So when you see me, think about a funeral home
A lot of niggas get fed to the crabs
And yeah I'm a boss, four hoes give me head in the bath
Pound of weed is like a medicine bag
I look at my son different
Gun spitting head in your back, stand over the body
And fire again, send Sigel a wire, I'm riding again
We getting it on, throw your man' leg on a loan
He can't walk, put your brother' tongue in a mail
He can't talk, kissing the ring or kissing the dirt?
I'm in the back of the limo, lifting her skirt, ripping your earth
Blowing weed in the Corona deluxe
Phony niggas wanna roll in a truck
But they don't know what's up
Fucking with killers you fucking with squealers
I'm the prince of the hood
I'm the one who wrote the criminal pillars
