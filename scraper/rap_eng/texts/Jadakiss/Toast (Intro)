I'd like to say a few words
Excuse me
I thank all y'all for coming out tonight
We all gathered here at this table
To celebrate the brothers we lost in the struggle
Those that fell victim to the street
All our loved ones behind the wall
And most of all, to the new up and coming cats
Paying homage, to those that paved the way
Let's toast to that
Cheers!
