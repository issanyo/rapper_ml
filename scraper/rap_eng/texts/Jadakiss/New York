[Hook] x2
New York.. New York,New York
New York.. New York,New York
New York.. New York,New York
New York.. New York,New York

[Verse 1: Oun-P]
No good kids in this MAAD city
Niggas took nine, still alive, just ask 50
We all bad boys over here, just ask Diddy
Let me hold a crown in my dreams, I asked Biggie (I got you)
I used to let my tape rock, till my tape popped
We bringing balls back, Gon' be hard to take shots
It got real in that 'Takeover' n 'Ether' era (facts!)
But now the plan is to take over and eat together
Esco and Jay still relevant
Rest in peace Pun, ye the Bronx was heavy then
Cause trust get buried in
We living in enemy square, And it’s weird
The gangsta celebrity's here (Wow)
The Big Apple, The Empire State
And I'mma connect the dots for the entire state
New York this and New York that
Well what the fuck is Hip-Hop without New York rap?

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Where it started at,and this is where it's gon' end at
Willing to put my life on the line to defend that (promises)
Yeah, I got us, don't panic
The apple will never be rotten, it's organic
We got way too much style, they can't cramp it
Career wouldn’t have got off the ground
If we ain’t stamp it
New York, and you ain’t got to wear the hat
Cause they love the way we talk no matter where we at
I know we had it first
I don’t care where it's at
No matter where you’ve been
Don’t nothing compare to that
Landmarks, the subways, the statues
Scared niggas only visit when they have to
You ain’t gotta sneeze for niggas to get at you
That’s real talk, in other words it's factual
Adversity is what kept us strong
From the days of Rich Porter to the Teflon Don (gone!)
