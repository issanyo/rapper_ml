[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Cut 'em off, like Korean barbecue scissors
I wear expensive Cartier frames, they ain't see the vision
I could do it all by myself, no assistance
And I could do it all by myself with no assistance

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Everyone that and this, but don't take risk
If you don't use your gift, you could lose your gift
All you gotta do is work, but choose your shift
If you don't got drive like me, you better find your lift
It's a different breeze that I blow
I was chasing waterfalls
I got good at being rich
I was great at being broke
Tryna tell me, what to do
You don't know what to do
If you knew the next move
You'd be me and not you
Being damaged your nice image
Gotta refuse all empathy
Gotta refuse all sympathy
Everybodyâ€™s fine till they need me financially
I'm a legend, if I go deceased
Call me crazy, when I get to a preaching
Kuwait, Kuwait, Bugatti
Diamonds
Yuh, yuh, yuh

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Cut 'em off, like Korean barbecue scissors
I wear expensive Cartier frames, they ain't see the vision
I could do it all by myself, no assistance
And I could do it all by myself, with no assistance

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
They ain't know me then, I bet they know me now
Dead weight ain't do nothing, but slow me down
Pure confidence, straight dominance
Need no co-defendants, no accomplices
No more guarantees, no more promises
Left wrist is Tourbillon, you know, what time it is
Waitin' to see if you arrived yet
They 'ont see the vision, they ain't get they eyes checked
Too many opinions make it hard for you
But really who better for the job than you?
Clip the noise now, I live a sound life
I just bet it on myself and double down twice

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Cut 'em off, like Korean barbecue scissors
I wear expensive Cartier frames, they ain't see the vision
I could do it all by myself, no assistance
And I could do it all by myself, with no assistance

[Interlude: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Catch me on the The One
Rule number one
Don't trust a nigga, who don't got brothers, who say, bruh
Rule number two
The niggas quick to say a leisure the quickest to say, fuck you
Rule number three
If you got money better stick with stick with a condom
Rule number four
Don't trust with a bitch, you just met who wanna cuddle

[Verse 3: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'ma give you a couple
I get paid in a duffle
I chose money not fame
So they payin' me double
Selling hits off my mumbles
It's so hard to be humble
It's okay to be ballin'
Nigga, just don't fumble
[?] at the crib
Step up the chips
My bible is my life jacket
I bring a bic to the bridges
Let's bring a bitch to the clinic
My lifestyle is so expensive
My ice all on my senses
Sorry for not being sensitive

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Cut 'em off, like Korean barbecue scissors
I wear expensive Cartier frames, they ain't see the vision
I could do it all by myself, no assistance
And I could do it all by myself, with no assistance
