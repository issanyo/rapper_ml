[Intro: Jadakiss]
I don't even do 24's, haha
I'm only doing this for you Poobs
They said I sound good on these down south beats
I've never seen you smile (Hue-HA)
Kiss my ass nigga

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
I'm a D-Block general, I be bringing paper in
Caught a bad deal in the beginning, now I'm raping them
Poked the Chevy out for the summer on 28's again
What is he drinking, what is he smoking, how he making them
How's he been nice for so long, why they hating him
Got him doing time, in the box, isolating him
Got money, and he love pressure, they ain't braking him
Tight shirts, tight pants, all these homo-sapiens
All these niggas is trash, and they over rating them
Put 'em in the booth with me, I'm annihilating them
Who ever you think is pumped up, I'm inflating them
Jail niggas, niggas in the hood, I relate to them
Blood money, and drug money, I was caking 'em
There when they broke the pies down, they was baking them
My enemies, I wish them all luck, and I pray for them
Cause when ever we cross paths, that'll be the day for them
Thompson's, M16's and AK's for them
Can just get one, bullets like Frito Lay for them
Close casket, leave nothing but legs for them
Fuck mercy, no need to beg for them
Yea, just let the Devil deal with 'em
Uh, and the other niggas that squeal with them
Fuck boys, do fuck shit
I wasn't before, and I'm still not to be fucked with
What!
