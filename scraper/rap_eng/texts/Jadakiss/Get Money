[Intro]
C'mon!
Ah-ha!!
What you say, uh?
We ain’t done!
Uh!

[Verse]
Wanna blow vanillas in the grill at my villa?
Play PS2 with Ru and Della?
Pick up my cell, spaz out and yell?
This is it right here, baby!
Wanna blow vanillas in the grill at my villa?
Play PS2 with Ru and Della? (Kiss!)
Pick up my cell, spaz out and yell?
Could’ve been a business call, oh well
Taught you wild shit ‘cause you was a wild chick
Scared when the Feds hit the trail in South Click
Know me, ma, shit, I’m in and out quick
Might get knocked with paper, never with wild bricks
End of the day, you’ll say that you ate right
Skull in the morn’, fistful on a late night
Keys to the Benz and you know where the Hummer at
Combo to the safe? Won’t be none of that
Hurt when I had to beat ya
You knew too much, so I had to keep ya
And even if my niggas ain’t like you
They knew you was mines
So regardless to the fact, they had to greet ya
Coming through JFK, no luggage
Just a carry-on with money, I’m so rugged
And the hood getting chips
Four-fif’ on the hip on some real Kiss of Death shit
What!

[Outro]
Yeah! The mothafuckin’ champ!
And if you don’t know, now you know
Ah-ha!
