[Chorus]
I'm in the trap 'til the sky changes
Drug dealer nightmares, millionaire migraines
I'm in the trap 'til the sky changes
Drug dealer nightmares, millionaire migraines
I'm in the trap 'til the sky changes
Drug dealer nightmares, millionaire migraines
I'm in the trap 'til the sky changes
Drug dealer nightmares, millionaire migraines

[Verse]
You ain’t getting no money, that dumb shit is senseless
I’m moving that dog food from Maryland to Memphis
Before I sold a record I was platinum in the trenches
Before I got in the game, I started on the benches
You minor league, I’m Ivy League, Princeton
I get it off the boat, after they sail them, Winston
All you have to do is add water, instant
Niggas'll kill you over a quarter, or 10 cents
That’s when your conscience starts speaking to your mind
Start looking for shit, seeking you should find
Up all hours of the night, peeking through the blind
Now you only communicating by speaking through your 9
Constantly waking up sweating and you’re cold
You don’t wanna die but you regret on getting old
Keep thinking whoever got knocked musta told
Either that, or maybe it’s a nigga on parole
Put them on to you, you get them all for him
Figure with you gone, fuck it, it’s more for him
Besides, he don’t wanna go up north again
'Cause that ain’t no place for a nigga as soft as him
They ain’t even on to you yet, but you running
You don’t know exactly when they coming, but they coming
When you love dealing you get a gut feeling
Feet above water, money above ceiling
Least a quarter million in a Damier duffle
You know me, I’m bringing the army and they’ll touch you
Light that, pass that, nigga where the hash at?
Bill Gates headaches, Scarface flashbacks
Nah, ain't no comparing that
Foreign attitude, so I'm wearing that
That little heart you got, I’m putting fear in that
And I ain’t gotta say, you know where I’m at

[Chorus]
I'm in the trap 'til the sky changes
Drug dealer nightmares, millionaire migraines
I'm in the trap 'til the sky changes
Drug dealer nightmares, millionaire migraines
I'm in the trap 'til the sky changes
Drug dealer nightmares, millionaire migraines
I'm in the trap 'til the sky changes
Drug dealer nightmares, millionaire migraines
