[Verse 1: Tsu Surf]
First Hov and Dame break up
Now Wayne ain't feelin' Baby
Just heard some lil nigga bumpin' Chief Keef
Talkin' about he don't bump Kiss
Man, this world fuckin' crazy
Ain't gotta worry about me though
Last of the trill, still potent as a kilo
Told you that I trust you, I be lyin', no Leo
Who knew problems started with Gee Money or Nino?
I know you seen that, loyalty and hard times
They'll show where your spleen at, believe that!
I swear I feel like Bishop ain't mean that
But… but we can't get Raheem back
One day you be good, then it be whatever
Shaq and Kobe beefin' like they ain't get three together
Rule one: no shorts should be tolerated
Scarface clapped his own man when he violated
O-Dog in Menace, we be mournin' him
Two for me, two for you – fuck it, cop four of 'em
To slaughter them, no problem scorin' for my man
Or playin' Scottie Pippen if my man goin' Jordan
Tryin' to see a mil before 26
Think I took the harder way, been flippin' every penny since
Stack every dime even if you gotta penny pinch
And you can call your own shots: Kenny Smith
Told him "Send a bird," I sent back a feature
Hustle, have to eat, I hate to trap but I'll bag a ki up
Feel like Tommy Buns in the church, about to clap the preacher
But my daughter got a belly and I have to feed her

[Interlude: Jadakiss]
YO to Newark, same shit goin' on
Hood to hood
Surf, I got you, my nigga

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Real lives, ain't no movie shit
Find out what theatre he in and I get the movie hit
Boys in the hood, ain't no menaces
It's mortal combat until we finish this
Back to back funerals, that's what the business is
No weapons retrieved, no witnesses
Yeah, some niggas just wanna burn
It's hard to make a stupid nigga wanna learn
Then the court get adjourned
End up in a cell, casket or a urn
Your death is already confirmed
Success is already adjourned
The hate get spreaded accordin' to the wealth
How you deal with the fake is accordin' to self
I'm from where nobody is sweet
If the kids can't eat, nobody can eat
If you ain't got the heart, then get out of the street
Can't win 'em all but you gotta compete
My words are a part of the beat
My flow is a part of the sea
The man I've become is what time did
Everybody get a turn, get online, kid
It's all in the mind, kid
Embrace loyalty when you find it
