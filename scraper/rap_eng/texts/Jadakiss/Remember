[Intro: Mary J. Blige sample (Sevyn Streeter)]
Oooohh, you remind me, yeah
(You remind me)
You remind me (you remind me)
Of such sweet memories

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Donnie...
Uh, mak-mak-mak-make a move y'all
Getting money for years nothing to prove y'all
From Mary to the Diddy
From Diddy to the bank, bought the Range in the city
Young boy rapping on them tapes
Ready rock bagging up messing up the plates
Thought I was fresh, nothing less
Leather, had the Pelle on or the jacket with the apes
Thugged out rocking at the Fever
.38 revolver'll make 'em a believer
Shiny suits, If You Think I'm Jiggy
Couldn't tell me shit after I did a song with Biggie
Swizzy and my double R fam
Had it locked in the 'jects with the dog DMX
And still getting big checks
And still bitches wanna give me sex (HUH?!)

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter (Mary J. Blige sample)]
Faded summer days
(You remind me, you remind me)
Baby, you remind me of cut-off jeans and J's
(You remind me, yeah)
Baby, you remind me of young mistakes we made
The one that got away, seems like yesterday
You remind me, yeah

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Used to move dope by the bundle
Push the 3 Series downtown to the Tunnel
Dream of this rap shit and getting out the jungle
Niggas was hungry, niggas was not humble
Nigga should not stumble
If you had something to sting, I woulda stung you
We gon' make it only dream I ever clung to
I remember making up raps, selling crack
Going to sleep and waking up moving packs
Niggas tried to move on me, so I had to move 'em back
Hardest nigga, brought the same attitude to rap
Remind me of the 'caine that remind me of the pain
I been rhyming insane since I got into the game, nigga

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter (Mary J. Blige sample)]
Faded summer days
(You remind me, you remind me)
Baby, you remind me of cut-off jeans and J's
(You remind me, yeah)
Baby, you remind me of young mistakes we made
The one that got away, seems like yesterday
You remind me, yeah

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yeah, L-O-X, yeah, HA-HAAAEEH!
From windmills to jump shots to carrying crack
Divorcing my day job getting married to rap
Ye-yeah, now they'll stretch you, back then you special
Get down with the clique, had to slap box and wrestle
Get hit in the mouth for talking when they ain't ask you
Two-tone British, slip-ons with the tassels
Lee's with the creases, Head sweatsuits and leases
Buck 50 for a soda and the pizza
Priceless, 'cause you could have fun for free
Either man-hunt, or tap-tap 1 2 3, ha
Even though it's all far behind me love
Those are just some of the things you remind me of, what?

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter (Mary J. Blige sample)]
Faded summer days
(You remind me, you remind me)
Baby, you remind me of cut-off jeans and J's
(You remind me, yeah)
Baby, you remind me of young mistakes we made
The one that got away, seems like yesterday
You remind me, yeah
