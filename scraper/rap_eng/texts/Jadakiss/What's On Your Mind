[Intro: Sheek Louch]
I don’t know what they…
I don’t know what’s on they mind
I know what I’m thinking about

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Yo, I be thinking bout my money, yep bout my wealth
How I be drinkin' you be thinkin’ I don’t care about my health
But I’m lightin’ and I’m smokin'
I got like 50 on my wrist and I ain’t jokin’
Shooters on deck, and they ready
Mack 11, 9 milli, automatie
And we pull up in them cars, and we skirtin'
Try to act like she don’t notice, it’s working
Dumb dumb bitch, It ain’t hard to tell
I’m tryna upgrade you, put you in Chanel
Or we can hit the hood and hit the local hotel
And hit it from behind until that pussy swell
Well, woo, more dutches
More 'gnac, more weed, more dutches
We hold each other up like crutches
D- Block, you know them niggas can’t touch us
What’s on your mind? Huh?

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
She a bad motherfucker, swear to God I love her
She always catch a seizure every time that I fuck her
And it’s straight to the hole like I’m ballin’ in the Rucker
Marty tryna peak, who that? That my brother
Sipping on the Henny got me up, so horny
I'mma fuck her till the sun up
Aw, put the ding a ling all up in her tummy
I’mma fuck her till she throw up, I ain't lyin'
I’m the realest, you could put it on my life
She gon’ make you disappear, yea she did it to the Sprite
She ain’t never have a nigga like me ever in her life
That’s why she on the wood like a fucking parasite
Ooh, I love the way she lick me, don’t leave a hickie
My girl finna forgive me, and I don't wanna risk it!

[Bridge: Sheek Louch]
It ain’t nothing but a word
Gun cocked for my nigga Ferg
A$AP, fuck what a nigga heard
And we don’t miss, we just plead the 5th
In any courtroom, ain’t that right Kiss? Huh?

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Guilty till I’m innocent
Came straight from the bottom of the tenements
I don’t leave the block dog till I finish it
I don’t fuck with it if I can’t benefit
I can count, read and got good penmanship
If I started out with it, I'mma end with it
I'mma figure out a way to try to blend with it
Shit y'all just now doin', we been did it
I ain’t talkin’ to ball players or rap niggas
I’m thinkin' a little further then that nigga
Yeah, from brick movers to pack niggas, fuck rap nigga
Now tell me, what’s on your mind?
