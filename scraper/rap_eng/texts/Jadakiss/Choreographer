[Jadakiss:]
Uh huh uh huh uh huh

Yo
Looking in your eyes
While I grab your torso
Notice my diamonds
Doing the two-step also

Seems like a match made in heaven
Or more so
The feet work got the people
Loving the floor show
Can't knock it til you tried it (correct?)

The lessons is private
We heating up changing the climate
In the guard is
I'll if bars could kill (correct?)

Me and you, Ma
Dancing with the stars for real
And I'm all for smoking

And the dancin (correct?)
I ain't gonna provoke
On hands should (correct?)

I'm a give you the chance to
Move it to the left to the right
Then take it down
Do the same thing again
Then break it down

I don't think you know
How hard that you making it now
Plus you all up in my ear
Making them sounds

But I ain't rushing
It's nothing
All I'm tryna do
Is follow instructions

[Rhea:]
I need you to follow
Every step I take
The beat
Gotta feel it pounding in your chest

Baby just let it go
Don't be shy
Just flow
Let me see what you got

All I wanna do is bring you closer
Taking over
Dance with me
Show me how you move
Show me how you do
So I know how hard I gotta work with you

I'll be your dance instructor
Choreographer
When you don't know how to move
I'll show you what to do

Now move it to the left
Take it down
Take it down
Now move it to the right
Break it down
Break it down

My hips keep the rhythm
Watch the way they sway
My lips gonna whisper to ya
While I shake
I like how you picked it up
You're so studious
Boy it's a private lesson

All I wanna do is bring you closer
Taking over
Dance with me
Show me how you move
Show me how you do
So I know how hard I gotta work with you

I'll be your dance instructor
Choreographer
When you don't know how to move
I'll show you what to do

Now move it to the left
Take it down
Take it down
Now move it to the right
Break it down
Break it down

All I wanna do is bring you closer
I'm taking over
Dance with me

All I wanna do is bring you closer
Taking over
Dance with me

Show me how you move
Show me how you do
So I know how hard
I gotta work with you

I'll be your dance instructor
Choreographer
When you don't know how to move
I'll show you what to do

Now move it to the left
Take it down
