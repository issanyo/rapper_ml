[Intro]
N.O.R.E the movie coming soon
Timbaland, shut the fuck up
Tryna be out in '98, you know
I'm tryna watch this movie, this the real shit
Shut the fuck up, '98, it's ours

[Verse 1: Nature]
Ayo, ayo
Regardless of rain or snow, sleet or hail
I kick street tales, choking niggas like I'm Sprewell
Golden State, holding your fate in the palm of my hand
Blow you away like it's part of the plan
I gotta call it like I see it, talk it like I be it
Walking my walk, thugged out orthopedic
'Cause I'm soon to be up, give me room watch me heat up
Niggas try to stick me like Abner Louima
Follow the leader, make me go extra hard
Yo N.O.R.E. should I hold back or show the repertoire
Quit at sixteen or throw in extra bars just for the non-believers
I show them why it's so hard to reach us
I get pussy with my father's features, puff heavily
See me at 6'1", weigh a buck 70
Catch me in spots y'all niggas never be
Packed in like Green Bay, Harlem week to Queens day
Performing acapella, no DJ
'98 Live, no replays, make it seem easy
So tell a friend to tell a friend that it's them again
Nature, Noreaga, wild gremlins

[Verse 2: Big Pun]
Yo, yo, champagne on the rocks, sporting a Fort Knox Lazarus
Shark salad with carrots, pork chops and applesauce
Twin connection, disrespect watch your body cave in
Pump the shotty guaging, hit the shorty while he potty training
I ain't playing, I'm truly the worst
You'll be the first to get his whole body fully reversed
Uzi ya hearse, leave you double-dead, I'm a bubble-head
I never listen to nothing my mother said, ayo
Ayo, I hold niggas ransom for money like Johnny Handsome
Been soning niggas for so long, I think I got a grandson
My passion is money, a stash and a honey
That won't ask questions but will blast anybody
That's my kind of girl, kind of world I want to live in
Not a cell or a prison or in Hell's Armageddon
Just a little ghetto where my niggas control the middle
We know the riddles of life where others know only a little

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Yo, yo been in rich places, sick places
Seen my story, 6,666 pages, wages
I rolled six aces and at the same dice games
I caught six cases, all over big faces
Now it's tipped laces, ready to dig faces
But the banger ain't a bit spacious
Niggas loading up their rib cages, cats like to rent places
Bloody lip taste it, but Cam is a big racist
But I stay imported, big places
But the world know the girl though, I fuck her off a furlough
She'll be up, hook me up, all your sales could be luck
Only question for these ducks is, "Baby girl could we fuck?"
You the type that need a wife
Thought L-O-X told y'all the key to life, asshole
Yo I don't play around, I lay it down, fuck around, I spray a round
Flick a biscuit, nigga risk it, my ass you can kick or kiss it

[Verse 4: Jadakiss (Styles P)]
Ain't no niggas in the world more thorough than this
Bust off and sit the hot barrel dead on your lips
Like two thirds of a brick, (Paniero) and 'Kiss
The kiss the crystal white fluffy part that'll (come back quick)
(See the plan is to stash all) and cash y'all's
(The weed so strong), they gotta put it glass jars
Niggas try to smoke me out the (moke me out)
'Cause the rims on my new joint be poking out
(I'm about to have no feelings, shit is deep)
Do they dance with the Devil when they sleep?
(I wake up gripping the air, wishing to hear)
Shit that they kick in your ear when your soul drift in the air
(My gift is half-rotten when I'm spitting some tears
That shit'll drop down my eye, I'm too tired to cry)
And I ain't never seen a nigga that's too live to die
(They say you get what ya ask for) so get it cause you asked for it
(If a nigga ain't a thief) Then he better have the cash for it
(And we gon' be around till ya body rot)
And if the Feds brung us in we get the same time Gotti got
Yeah, nigga!

[Verse 5: Noreaga]
Ayo, there's two ways into the hood, one plain
The other smoke chronic like straight to the brain
Ayo let's get loose, Hennessy straight with tomato juice
Queens stallion, my guns, fully Italian
Now y'all niggas recognize medallions
I play the best hood, O-T with Tim Westwood
Used to be on Section 8, now my section is good
Thugged out niggas, we eat as much as we could
And I don't give a fuck what, yo I save my shit
And I don't give a fuck what, you can save your shit
Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick
Listen to Bob Marley, y'all funny niggas like Steve Harvey
Fronting live with a weak army
I play the nice guy too and even smoke with you
But the realness, I ain't got no love for you
That's why I never do a song with you
Not even if your baby moms fucked the crew
And promised to give us head and swallow too
I still say low, no is no, no can do
Ya niggas drinking Haterade, drinking my flow

[Outro: Noreaga]
Yo, thug shit thug shit what what
What the fuck is the deal, Thugged Out Entertainment
Untertainment
L-O-X, Terror Squad, this shit is fuckin' official
