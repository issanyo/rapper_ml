[Intro: Gillie Da Kid]
Go ahead and try your luck if you wanna.. Huh?

[Verse 1: Gillie Da Kid]
Let me talk to em
Gold rollies, gold chain, gold frames, no lame
Gold bently, tanned seat, bitch giving me slow brain
Move that cocaine, cook it to rock
I put it on the block the fiends dancing like the soul train
Got lil guns leave a hole, no stain
Got big guns, he'll bring down a whole plane
High off that purple, nigga soul plane
These niggas actin like they want that jazz Cole Train
Put ma shooters on your ass, dont say no names
Take it like a gangsta, nigga throw flames
Niggas so lame, never got no change
Never got hoes man, never move whole thang
And all I know is murder murder
And beefing me is just a fucking a burger
I flip it cook it, then I fucking serve ya
And thats the truth lifes a [?]

[Hook]
I'm not to be fucked with
I'm not to be fucked with, I'm not
I'm I'm not to be fucked with
I'm not to be fucked with, I'm not
I'm not to be fucked with
I'm not to be fucked with, I'm not
I'm I'm not to be fucked with
I'm not to be fucked with

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Rolls gold rollies, rose gold kilo
All black everything, even my Forty Belows
Nigga we really making movies, y'all shooting free throws
Just a bunch of corns with chips, I call em fritos
Nothing like me though, connect me and Niko
Its hard for the people, I'm tryna dodge the rico
Greater than, never less than, never equal
When them slugs fly, niggas die, no sequel
Sixty for the diesel, thirty for that whitch bitch
My young boys still doing their numbers on the night shift
Looking for that thang, either smoke it or they might sniff
Stay out of the way, to avoid light drift
Cause when you get money, broke niggas might snitch
Praying for your downfall, or they might wish
This is a whole entree, thats a light dish
I'll get you touched quick
Your bitches'll suck dick
And you should already know

[Hook]
