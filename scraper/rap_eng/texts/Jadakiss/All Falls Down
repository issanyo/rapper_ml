[Hook - T.L. Cross]
One thing y'all know about me
I don't play, so just beware
You catch me up in V.I.P
Up in the club, that's my atmosphere
Because I got money to spend -- I keep getting it in
From the hood, so I don't play fair
And I'mma keep living it up, keep getting it up
Keep throwing it up until it all falls down

[Verse 1 - Jadakiss]
Break the P's down to onions, money in abundance
I'm in the lower millions, I'm trying to get in the hundreds
Niggas' pants too tight to fight, so they don't want it
You pay for somebody to protect you, so where your gun at?
Been there, done that; seen the coke come back
Seen niggas come home from jail, then run back
Singing the same sad song, my nigga -- one that
Negative energy stick to him like a thumbtack
Real hustler, probably sold a million and one packs
Niggas think they smart and nice, but they dumb wack
It's only 'til you crack they skull, give them a mum' wrap
When it's cold, I reside wherever the sun's at
Son's back, what?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Top of the league, 3-piece suit or fatigues
All I got to do is look a certain way and you'll bleed
4 words describe me: "Niggas can't fuck around"
Fish scale verses: prices go up and down
Put it out there, see if it taste right
Young Jewish bulldog keeping the case right
Apartment on the 4th floor, keeping the base right
Jacksons and Benjamins keeping the safe right
First and the 15th is when we break nights
Bunch of red beams on your head like brake lights
Bitches that fucked everybody turned into fake dykes
Was biting the whole day -- it's gonna be a great night

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Dice hitting the wall, decks getting shuffled
Nines getting wiped down, Tecs getting muffled
Perico in the plastic stacks in the duffel
Niggas coming through getting racks on the muscle
You asked me for money, I ain't ask you to hustle
The industry is hurt, they looking for the next Russell
The hip-hop cops outside waiting to cuff you
The Bloods is on Rikers Island waiting to cut you
Niggas on the outside just want to abduct you
Dudes turned they back on you that you look up to
Keep throwing mine in the air, I got enough to
And I don't like spending my money, nigga...I love to
