[Intro]
You know

[Hook]
M-m-money change you
Devils, angels
We the ones who say
What you can and what you can't
M-money change you
Devils, angels
We the ones who say
What you can and what you can't
Money change you
Devils, angels
We the ones who say
What you can and what you can't do
M-money change you
Devils, angels
M-m-money change you
Devils, angels

[Verse 1]
Coming through the storm in the Ralph Lauren rain suit
You salute or you shoot, who raised you?
They say I dropped jewels but I never get the appraisal
Went through his back but it started at his naval
You your brothers keeper but, Cain killed Abel
Shit was stable, then it got fatal
Now mama bring in the Jesus
Lil' homie loading the tre-duce
'Bout to roll around in the grey coupe
Like it's eighty-three in Beirut
Niggas facing the same truth
We the ones who say and what you can't do

[Hook]
M-m-money change you
Devils, angels
We the ones who say
What you can and what you can't
M-money change you
Devils, angels
We the ones who say
What you can and what you can't
Money change you
Devils, angels
We the ones who say
What you can and what you can't do
M-money change you
Devils, angels
M-m-money change you
Devils, angels

[Verse 2]
Crash the plane like Bane crew
Show these niggas what insane do
They gon' say that money change you
Only your circumstances, you gon' be the same you
Dance with the devil but never call it the devil dance
Out here trying to make it until I get me a better chance
Married to the streets but I never gave her a wedding band
Now it's Instagram; used to be telegram
Now you know I'm a heavy metal fan
Ain't speaking no heavy metal band
I'm talking that blue steel
And that automatic shotgun making the shit real

[Hook]
M-m-money change you
Devils, angels
We the ones who say
What you can and what you can't
M-money change you
Devils, angels
We the ones who say
What you can and what you can't
Money change you
Devils, angels
We the ones who say
What you can and what you can't do
M-money change you
Devils, angels
M-m-money change you
Devils, angels

[Verse 3]
Burn the money like the Joker did
Catch angel tears, soak in it
Demons in my ear got to smoke again
Cause they telling me I should Loc again
And that's the path where the wrath lies
The future lives, the past dies
I'm just present, getting mad high
You cannot use weed to be baptised
I live life like it's a fast ride
No breaks, I ain't in the place where the road straight
I won't slow down till the door straight
Don't bust cause you got blood, you could donate

[Hook]
M-m-money change you
Devils, angels
We the ones who say
What you can and what you can't
M-money change you
Devils, angels
We the ones who say
What you can and what you can't
Money change you
Devils, angels
We the ones who say
What you can and what you can't do
M-money change you
Devils, angels
M-m-money change you
Devils, angels
M-m-money
