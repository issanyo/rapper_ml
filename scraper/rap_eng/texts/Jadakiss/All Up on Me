[Chorus: Rashad]
You're all up on me
And you barely know me
We can go somewhere, ma
Come on, don’t be scared now
When the club's out, we can roll out
If you want to get a room, we can handle that
When the club's out, we can roll out
If you want to get a room, we can handle that

[Verse 1: J-Hood]
You're all up on me
Must have knew I’m feeling lonely
I don’t want a girl, I need a homie
I'm loving the way you backing it up on me
And when the club's out, we can roll out
Got the seven with their dubs out, thugs with the snubs out
Yeah my name Joshua Hood
Let's play the five star suite, I'll be popping the goods
You can ride on top of the world, you won't stop if you could
And the olive green dropping the hood
Plus she always giving me top like she should
Baby girl, we can ride out now or get popped where you stood

[Chorus: Rashad]
You're all up on me
And you barely know me
We can go somewhere, ma
Come on, don’t be scared now
When the club's out, we can roll out
If you want to get a room, we can handle that
When the club's out, we can roll out
If you want to get a room, we can handle that

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
She barely know me
But she see the pink diamonds up in the Roley
I’m with my little man H-double-O-D
We in the back of the club, blowing the O-Z
Booty was right, outfit from money
Small waist, fat ass, far from boney
From ATL, said her name was Monique
And when Hood bagged her friend, I can tell she was on me
Then she said, "Jada, I’m kinda hungry"
Breakfast on you, back shots on me
Everything is timing with Kiss
We up out of the joint, now he in the seven, I’m in the six
No silicone, already examined the tits
So we gone get it on after the salmon and grits
And after I hit, I’m gone
Back up town, Hood check me later, daddy hit my phone

[Chorus: Rashad]
You're all up on me
And you barely know me
We can go somewhere, ma
Come on, don’t be scared now
When the club's out, we can roll out
If you want to get a room, we can handle that
When the club's out, we can roll out
If you want to get a room, we can handle that

[VERSE 3:]
And we can stay right here to the night's done
Order some bottles, light something up and have some fun
Try the V.I.P. room, lock the door with a broom
Got the hand size camera on zoom
And you cruise with the rest of my team
And the music is loud, so it’s hard for them to hear you scream
And you can give me brains 'cause you smart, too
Or we can break out and get a room for part two
You all up on me and barely know me
Can’t wait to get to the room so you can really show me
I’m J-Hood, ma, dick way good, ma
D-Block platinum plus, but I'ma stay hood, ma

[Bridge: Rashad]
Why you all up on me if (why you all up on me if)
You ain’t coming home with me tonight?
Why you all up on me if (whispering all in my ear)
You ain’t coming home with me tonight?

[Chorus: Rashad]
You're all up on me
And you barely know me
We can go somewhere, ma
Come on, don’t be scared now
When the club's out, we can roll out
If you want to get a room, we can handle that
When the club's out, we can roll out
If you want to get a room, we can handle that
