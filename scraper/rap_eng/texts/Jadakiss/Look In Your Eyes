[Chorus: REO Speedwagon]

You should have seen by the look in my eyes Baby
There was something missing
You should have known by the tone of my voice maybe
But you didn't listen

[Intro: Bleu Davinci]
Told y'all niggas
Shit ain't got stop nigga
Y'all fittin' to hate this
Yeah
Look

[Verse 1: Bleu Davinci]
While me and my niggas bubble the streets
Niggas still trying to knock me off
For real they come where I sleep
And don't put nuttin' but some hoes in a jeep
That's why I put my faith in the Lord
But still caressing the heat
And in this jungle where they kill and they eat
I stand still with the Lion
Big Meech and the rest of the fleet
Convicted felons is what they said we would be
Look up it's 05'
They was screaming that shit in 03'
You can't see?
This shit come from less than an OZ
Living in Big's shit
Resting with OG's
Test if it's gon be
Death if it's gon be
Getting rich, going broke
I'ma' stay being me!
See the hurt in the tone of my speech
No matter if it's birds or the words that I speak
I'ma' eat
You should've seen by the look on my face
No matter if I ever drop an album
I'ma' still get cake
Wait!


[Chorus 2: REO Speedwagon]

You should have seen by the look in my eyes Baby
Ah-haaaaaa (Kiss' signature laugh)
There was something missing
You should have known by the tone of my voice maybe
But you didn't listen
{2nd Intro within the chorus:  Jadakiss}
BMF Nigga.  D-Block
BLEU. JADA. 2 Gunz up


[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo
Squeeze 10 then another 5
I'm from the other side
Where them boys will kill your whole mother side
But I ain't really tryna hear that Cuz
The 40 Cal. is in the Range where the airbag was
Them things that make noise is on us
The Boys is on us
When it's our turn the Lord'll warn us
Take care of my shorty if a few of them hit me
But right now I got Bleu and em with me
Whole crew in a Bentley
Cashmere under the Ol' Leather
Muthafuka I move more Bird than cold weather
Niggas ain't tellin' they stabbin' ya
Understand
The Kush ain't purple it's lavender
Listen dog

And I'm the champion you gon' always be challenger
My DBlock, BMF niggas'll handle ya
If you can look in my eyes
You'll see that I'll damage ya

[Last Chorus:  REO Speedwagon]
You should have seen by the look in my eyes Baby
There was something missing
