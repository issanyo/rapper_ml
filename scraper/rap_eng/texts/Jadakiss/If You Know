[Intro: Sheek Louch & Jadakiss]
Yo I might get drunk
Jeckel and Hyde
Roll these with lemons
I'm tellin' y'all Niggas
Swizz Beatz

[Chorus]
If you know, like we know, like they know
L.O.X. is the best
If you know, like we know, like they know
Swizz Beatz is the best
If you know, like we know, like they know
Ruff Ryders is the best
If you know, like we know, like they know
We'll bring it to their chest

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch, Styles P, Jadakiss & Swizz Beatz]
Yo if I can't make money then you can't either
If I didn't have to rap, I have blow in the freezer
If I can't rock Nikes or Tim's with double soles
I have the 9 in the pound and leave your ass full of holes
If I didn't push a Benz and I didn't push a Lex
Then the ambulance'll come and they be pushin' on your chest
If I couldn't hit the studio and make another record
For my double R Niggas, I'll lay y'all on stretchers
Now I might get drunk or I might get high
But my game stay Trump and my style stay fly
I might hit a dime or I might hit a deuce
And when I wanna go to war is when you wanna call a truce
I might buy 'em cooked, dough I might buy 'em raw
And I might tap your chin or I might cross your jaw
Now I might go 18's, I might go 20's
I might use dumdums 'cause y'all niggas dummies

[Chorus]
If you know, like we know, like they know
L.O.X. is the best
If you know, like we know, like they know
Swizz Beatz is the best
If you know, like we know, like they know
Ruff Ryders is the best
If you know, like we know, like they know
We'll bring it to their chest

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch, Jadakiss, Styles P & Swizz Beatz]
Ayo, me without weight is like Harlem without 8
Yeah, me with no funds is like Queens with no dunns
And me with no beef is like Brooklyn with no guns
Man and me with no beats is like Cali with no blunts
First I got head from her then I hit her from the back
Then she told me that she hustled so I hit her with a pack
Yeah, screw how many mics you got
How much ice you got, my bullets'll make you icy-hot
Y'all, all my niggas killas we don't talk on the phone
And give a way better message when we come in your home
Yo, catch me Down-South when I'm pumpin' up things
And my name ain't Rover, don't jump on my rings
Man, you gotta have your hustle right when you up in the game
You gotta have your lawyer money for you firm-aly change
And don't you leave out the house without bringin your things
We gonna Ruff Ryde, nigga, from here to the bing

[Interlude: Drag-On]
What, you greaseball cocksuckers thought it was over?!
This double R, Nigga, L.O.X
We are the streets
When the kennels is open the dogs is biting, bitch
Shit's real

[Verse 3: Drag-On & Eve]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, I might pull up in a V that cost more than a buck
Then turn around and burn it cause you thought it was plush
Anytime I get on fire I get a car to match
And tell any rapper you name, you guard it black
When I bust my hammer, I nail my nigga
We the Ruff Ryder family, all hail, my niggas
And I might ride, I might die, that's up to the Lord
And my niggas might come home, that's up to the board
Yo, If money make you feel good, I'm happy with lead
Joe Pesci-style, kickin' niggas after they dead
Picture the litter, hold the 4-5th for my niggas
Writin' the venom, ass look right in the denim
I'm dockin' ya pay, word from me you clockin' the yay
I hustle for real, let you hold the block for a day
Pull it in your brain and give you a hot idea
You wanna low, here's a casket, you can hide out there

[Chorus]
If you know, like we know, like they know
L.O.X. is the best
If you know, like we know, like they know
Swizz Beatz is the best
If you know, like we know, like they know
Ruff Ryders is the best
If you know, like we know, like they know
We'll bring it to ya chest!!
