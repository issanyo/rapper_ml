Yo green lets launch this muthafucker (invasion) eheh eheh eheh

Alot of niggas lost their pops to the drug game
Other niggas lost their blocks when the thugs came
They knew how to box they ain't know bout the slug game
Soon as the money get right,thats when the love change
Niggas know who to call when they want raw, Kiss is the corner stone of the corner store
D-Block general he stay shinning
In the back of the van 2k9ing
My dope so strong is giving fiends the hiccups, coke so high it got niggas doing stickups
Found out another nigga dead light the piff up,make sure one is in the head load the fifth up(every verse deserves a pullback 3x)

Play my hand right babe I held aces
None on the scene but blood and shell cases
Nike gloves on the team they can't trace us
Snitches on the witness protection getting facelifts
These niggas would never be able to fuck with me
Say my grave before I give em a buck 50
Whole hood with me they hating be on spiffy
Everything is a short shot none iffy
Feel dancing with the devil on occasions
My delivery is incredible and amazing
Listen when ain't selling records am sellinq haze in
Bout to have the sour and the kush in a couple dayz in
Back to these faggot ass industry niggas, everybody consider yourself enemy niggas
Headshot same way it did Kennedy niggas
Me P and Louch is the rap trinity niggas
And it's all real here ain't no scripts to it
Jail niggas spending yard n burn sticks to it
Other niggas zone out knock off bricks to it
Double then an Add lib light lil mix to it
