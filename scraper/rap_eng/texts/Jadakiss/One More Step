[Intro: Jadakiss]
Uh-huh, yup, AH-HAH!

[Verse 1: Jadakiss & Styles P]
Cyphers in front of the Apollo as a shorty
Now I got a clip full of hollows in the .40
Louis's, Gucci's, every now and then Maurice
I take too long to come back, send for me
Know how to work it, big things poppin'
On the underground circuit, maintain 'til it surfaced
The nerve of these peasants, treat a rap budget
Like a bird how I stretch it, think they get the message
Waters, dutchies, lot of herb in the session
So-called tough guys, herbs with aggression
Put your thoughts all over the curb with the Wesson
What used to be superb now is depressin'
Negative energy generated from the snakes
And the centipedes, you will remember me
I just get the storm started, cold-blooded, warm-hearted
Either way, you on target
Move to the side like a lane merge
The gun's like fried rice, who want they brain stirred?
Enter the limelight, lemon drop-top off of crime life
Always see the crew in the hindsight, yeah
American sedan, shooters got Berettas in they hands
This is mafia, veterans are planned
Word to the tape on the brick
This is raw, I'm in the four-by-four, 8 plus 8 in the clip
Hustling Harry Potter, shaking the brick
Ice in the bracelet, give the matrix a glitch
And my car's like a spaceship
Got gold in my Nike checks, Jordans got ice in the laces
Pants got a gun where the waist is, it's basic
Shirts smell like earth smoke, chirp, yo
Chirp back, let me know who getting murked though
Yeah, we getting money, nigga, who getting work though?
And I got the kush, nigga, I got the purple
Move squares 'cause we gotta hold down the circle
Kill you or hurt you, whatever's a virtue
Beat you like your parents when you breaking your curfew

[Hook: Jadakiss (Styles P)]
Yeah, homie live life to the death
(We gon' make it to the top) Just one more step
Vicious money, it don't matter if it's cash or a check
(We gon' make it to the top) Just one more step
Big houses, cars, and jewels that's wet
(We gon' make it to the top) Just one more step
'Til the family, friends, whole life is set
(We gon' make it to the top) Just one more step
One more step

[Jadakiss] + (Styles P)
Yo, livin my life (what's left of it)
Don't try to go to jail but if you do (make the best of it)
If you crash into a bullet (then it ain't no estimate)
It's a money-back guarantee my nigga (death's a definite)
This is audio crack (guess who's chef'in it?)
Jadakiss and S.P. (do this effortless)
Gunplay make you do whatever (son say)
If the Lord send you a flight (the ticket is one-way)
Put that work in when you young, you get (power)
Money don't match the runnin and get (sour)
Still (rep the hood to the death)
A promise is only good if it's kept (niggas'd kill you for less)
(Silence is golden) Go 'head, keep dozin
The window of opportunity (keeps closin)
We gon' see if you really a clutch baller
A cell is small (but a casket is much smaller)
(Burn out 30 a session) 60 a ki' shit
(That street shit) Jada and P shit
(Lambo's, hoopties) Shooters and groupies
(Monte Claire) D square (Emilio Poochie)
Long trips (short trips) makin me nauseous
(Courtship) Gave them Jews money for Porsches
(Made a couple mil') but it's small shit
(We rap and keep raw) so we on some street law (court shit)
(Walls still spin) Upgraded the floor flip
(Ain't touch it) ain't see it (ain't hear about it)
If it's money gone (believe we gon' care about it)
Send some niggas to your crib (take the air up out it)
(Leave some blood up in it)
Listen fam, the Lamb's the color of toast (seats like butter in it)
No hammers in the club (box cutter in it)
Long money and big checks
(Get popped in the chest, face) wig, neck (trey-pound) sick tec
(Play the game) Get a plane if you shipwrecked
(Learns from the best) if you ain't learn shit yet
(Yeah!) Motherfucker
