[Verse 1: 360]
I get a thrill when they tell me something that I can't do
Conquered every single challenge heres a few examples
Like I did my OWN videos followed my OWN regimen
To think about it I did my OWN artist development
Labels want to sign me - come correct with the contract
Tryna throw me off - tell em show me the carfax
New York nigga from Queens doing the same
But I hit bitches from LA on my California King
You could own her I just use her as a loaner
Then she blew me like she was cheering for Oklahoma
I Made her drop it low then pick it up like a tacoma
Her man bang crip but he gon need a blood donor whoa
We those niggas you dont approach
Put it down dog you move shakin you Freddie Roach
Billionaire glow like the loans came through
My network like Oprah she do her OWN thing too

[Hook]
We don't play by the rules, we do our own thing
And when we get in the zone we just go insane, OH!!!
You know I rock, And I'm gone do my thing
Regardless of the hate, that yall niggas bring

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Me I always led by example
Little bundle of dope niggas is still waiting for me to stamp you
It ain't worth clapping I just beat him with the handle
All yall pussy I ain't worried bout what your man do
I do what I want in something new every month
Shit I don't even need I just do it to stunt
Cartel contacts niggas respond back
You could recoup quicker off a brick than a contract
Rules ain't something I play by
Always been a G so the code I stay by
Guard you secrets never pillow talk or sneak diss
Make sure your rims is deep dish
Try to lay off the red meat and eat fish
Introduce you to Jada might let you meet Kiss
Keep that chrome thing one in your dome thing
And I don't need no help cuz I do my Own Thing
Motha Fucka !!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Part time rapping and full time robbing
Ain't no space in the trunk of my cadi stay throbbing
Ain't gon let these police fuck up my night
Went through the light and changed the sprite to purple soda with Ice
Like its a magic trick
Hocus Pocus smoking the dopest with a Cali bitch
Syrup and pineapple Fanta it keep me cool
But I won't hesitate to twerk out them hammers
187's and 211's I'm putting in work on the scanner- a fool
Gangsta G.I.B banned from radio
Won't suck a nigga dick or take ass shots like Gravy tho
Rapper nigga trash your image biodegradable
As useless as a used tampon - Fuck wit unfadeable Fred
The heavy box chevy ox blood red
Come to the streets knock out my head or I get knocked by the feds
And they listening so I know they coming
But until then ima in my momma kitchen breaking down something
Bitch I do my Own Thing!

[Hook]
