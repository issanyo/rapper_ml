[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
I'm the hottest in the hood, chick game silly
Chick hand in my draws tryin to Free Willy
Now all y'all really tryin to rhyme like me
Boy verse fly like I wrote in on the plane
Huh! Push weight no 'roids
Now the check cleared Shakedown, Bad Boy
Hottest in the world, hottest in the game
Rap King James, I'ma put it on the chain
Big hog at the valet DAMN

Yeah! I get my 2Pac on
Thuglife hottest in the hood dot com

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Eh-HEEEH! Uh, yeah
Five years off, number three in the country
Proof is in the pudding, yeah the hood wants me
Straight from the kitchen, hate from a distance
Not only the hottest but the most consistent (Why?)
I'm about money and pussy, I'm not a banger (uh-uh)
Always gon' be somewhere to put me, I'm like a hanger (uh)
One thing about life, ain't no sequel
Montega, Hayes, Pedico, E-Pills
'Bout to run a train on your wifey and I'm second next
Treat ya face like +The Name of Love+ while I'm +Steppin+
Tour bus wit a buch of automatic weapons
"Hottest in the Hood" remix and I'm reppin

And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on, and the beat goes on

[Verse 3: Rick Ross (Diddy)]
Step out the kitchen, look like I'm slippin'
The chick made a puddle of it how the jewels drippin'
My niggas form a huddle everybody got positions
The crib's Sportcenter, I ball on commission
Run but I catch ya, fumble when I wet ya
(Ross, what they do?) Crumble under pressure
That boy outta sight till that boy outta white
Call the stick JJ cause that bitch dynamite
Talkin China white, all black kicks
Red Cafe, all black six
Six spanish girls, tall black chicks
She got a pair of shoes but you call that dick

[Verse 4: Fabolous]
It's LoSo..
Aiyyo, truthfully...How can they mistake you for me?
(What?) You're a joker, imitation, a spoof of me
Call the referee, I consider it FOUL
They just, follow my swag, Twitter my style
Knowin I can make it go down. no Draino
Son, I'll get up in yo ass, no rainbow
I'm on my grown-man, time-piece, no chain-o
Cuts on the face, yeah the watch's on Maino
I body this joint, it's only the tag
Who wanna be the new single and get thrown in the bag?
Huh, guess who's back wit a motherfuckin vengeance
Hottest in the hood like a motherfuckin engine

[Chorus: Red Cafe]
And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on, and the beat goes on
And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on, and the beat goes on
I'm the hottest nigga, in the hooooooooooddddddddd!!!!!
I'm the hottest nigga, in the hooooooooooddddddddd!!!!!
I'm the hottest nigga, in the hooooooooooddddddddd!!!!!
I'm the hottest nigga, in the hooooooooooddddddddd!!!!!

[Verse 5: OJ Da Juiceman]

Betta ask somebody, man I'm good
Red diamond chain, I'm hood (ayy, okay!)
Big panky raing like bug
Flaunt the credit but Juice still a thug
Still trappin in the hood wit a plug
And I'm workin in the kitchen cookin drugs
Kushy blunt got me high like a bug
Gold ring like the NBA Club
I'll invent a hunter dining witcha girl
Alaska and Atlanta hot herb
Young Ju' manye, he a flam-er

[Chorus: Red Cafe]
And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on, and the beat goes on
And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on, and the beat goes on
