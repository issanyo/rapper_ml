F**k it n***a go and get your guns, lets end this shit
Oh yeah, i forgot, you move with the government
Bosses garbage, your swag can't cover it
Its on everyday, i let the desi spray
Big sh*t poppers, small resumes
Ya'll the reason they made the 360's
They can't make their money back off you, too risky
I know I've been gone for a minute, did you miss me
Top 5 dead or alive, don't forget me

Aero Sinc:
What's this in my jeans, pocket full of Queen's
Spending Lizzy on every n***a that's in the team
Full of loyalty, team full of loyalty
Treat my brothers like kings, team full of royalty yeah
The bright lights, the high life
Can't wait till i can say, that's my life
Couple n***as in the team they already live it
Did it done it bought the team now they wipe their windows with it
And i'm just watching, observating, how to f***ing get it
And when i get it, guess what, imma f***ing spend it
Rolls Royce Ghost i'm in, you'll f***ing see me in it
Got a fetish for the finer things in life
Leave on the lights i tell her

Bad B***h turn a straight chick [?}
And i ain't f***ing with you if you ain't real n***a
Imma hit a mil with or without a mil ow
Imma stack it up
So i can knock it down
Can't wait till i can say "just copped another house"
Way out in the country i can't even pronounce
Private location i can't even announce
A b***h is by the pool side and it ain't even summer
Yeah they love a n***a cause a n***as on the come up
...
And last night, we never slept
Had a blast with some b***hes that we just met
[?]
But don't fret i ain't nuttin' like [?] ex
And she was having fun
So i was having fun
She was getting drunk, i had [?] up in my lungs
I got so high it's no lie i swear i was floating and stuff
I got so high it's no lie i swear Wiz ain't f***ing with us
I'm exaggerating
Cah' that's what it does
That Californiacation pardon me i mean Dutch
I'm out in Amsterdam if you been there then you know what's up

Young Adz:
My n***a paps got nicked with a G-Pack
They gave him two and a half, i told him just eat that
You gotta plead guilty when you know you can't beat that
Rap style but you see me where all them G's at
I ride with them killers
They might not make it to Jannah
But for respecting that Skrilla
They had to send some N***as Jahannam. Man
So i pray for 'em
Nanny's getting older
She used to pray for me
I ain't seen her in time
Hope it's not too late for me
Gotta clear my mind
London ain't the place for me
I'll be in the states
Told all my b***hes don't wait on me
I used to be in cunch riding for a couple months
Now we pull up in that foreign and girls are with us
She tell me it's love
I tell her it's lust
Get in her and buss
Then i'm gone for month
The first youngen standing rock at me up in the dot
Everyone was shretting crow that s**t had to stop
Caught cases everyday i was ducking the cops
The judge said your only one step away from the box
You gotta turn him off
Or it have your mumzy burying you put you in the box
N***as tryna' change, say they take the Shahadah
But your brothers will snake you
Make your mum or make your Janazah
I'm counting these racks
I'm watching my people
Cause n***as be evil and b***hes deceitful
Killing it when i was rapping with my brother Ben
Praying for my hitters judge tryna' give Gutta 10
Ion' know these n***as
In my own ends thinking I don't know these n***as
I could have my n***a dead they put holes in n***as
Or tell pancake to go round and soak these n***as
Now we 'bout to rave Gucci for what it's worth
Told Lil Bantan don't worry we'll make it work
To be anything big you gotta take a risk
B***hes see me shopping in Westfield and wanna take a pic
Woke up this morning lemme tell you how i feel
Pockets ain't big enough, i need to make a mill
Alpo and n***as, n***as snake for real
Tell the record label 100 bags and ill take the deal

You need the best rapper in the game, take me
Can introduce you to some parts of life you ain't seen
I'm doing sh*t your dad can't do and i ain't even 18

Aero Sinc:
I turn thoughts into money
Money into clothes
Got European swag
Margiela on my toes
[?] and addiction for these wh**es
Got me smelling like a mil but i'm feeling like more
So imma take over, till they know me n***a
I ain't Nova Scotia, where the f**k n***a
Out in Japan, Konichiwa
It don't matter if its pounds, dollars or yen
If its money to be got
Imma get it till my n***as in the bin
When you come out life might be different

Young Adz:
Yeah yeah, these n***as change on me like British weather
Shout my n***as on the field out that they getting cheddar
Right now my Nannies ill and she ain't getting better
Its like my life is going bad but music is getting better
I signed a deal with Kiss, diamonds dancing on my wrist
But my n***as in jail for that shooting and a stick
I gotta stay grateful, many try but many fail
I spent most of 2012 out on bail now i ain't seeing any cells
You can know a man for life that don't mean sh*t
Money change a n***a you'll see a pound for greedest
You can f**k with a b***h, she can know your secret
But she can't still f**k around with them weak pr*cks
Sh*t is mad
Gutta told me how to bag life we had the ends like
Now we looking at mad years for making that skeng fly
Him and [?] sharing the same cell, i miss my team
And when your [?] no one is sending p
I spit that hard sh*t, coming from my heart sh*t
Came to take over now everyone is a target
From young i was with all them bitties making that hard flip
Yo, I would've been eating regardless
Real rap star, 30 on my wrist
That mac10 4 stacks 30 and that clip
7 years old, when i was learning how to spit
Olders taught me the game man i wasn't turning back for sh*t
I seen my mummy's face in court, i'm sitting in the dock
They going to reach the verdict all i can do is watch
Looking up like Allah get me out this mess
And when this case won up ain't looking to hit the pen
