[Intro]
Wooo
Hey!
Wooo
It's never over, it’s never over
Hey, hey!
It's never over, it's never over
Hey, hey!

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Which rapper wanna smile on they neck? You a cock sucker
You ain’t say Styles is the best? I'm disgustin'
What up then? Start the discussion
The ends is a high me, that's a body in Hudson
Lucky to be found by the river patrol
He a piece of shit, flush him, fuck diggin' a hole
Which rapper said he the best? Tell 'em Ghost said he's a bitch
And told him to say less and give him my address
Yeah, the top ten niggas is soft as a jazz fest
Put my blade to they skin and stretch it like spandex
But now I'm on some entrepreneur shit
Spa seats in the car, can of god, full of that raw shit, at least a zip
Violate, hit ’em with at least a clip
Knocked out his eyeballs, he ain’t even peeped the shit
Ghost numb like he on cocaine and ether mixed
Simply don't give a fuck, cool when the reefer lit

[Chorus: Styles P & Sheek Louch]
They say hip hop is dead but it’s never over
They say lyricism is dead but it's never over
Hey, hey!
It's never over, it's never over
Hey, hey!
It’s never over, it's never over
Hey, hey!
And if we ever go to war, it ain't never over
They say hip hop is dead but it's never over
They say lyricism is dead but it's never over
Yeah, them wack niggas winnin' but it's never over
Let's go
It's never over, it's never over
Hey, hey!
It's never over, it's never over
Hey, hey!

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Donnie O
Buy coke, cook that
Bring it back, get a pack
Put it on the block, fuck around, I'ma make it clap
Run from Jay, throw the gun, hide in the fiend house
Give her money, turn that mother fucker to a greenhouse
Next door, Heroin, pills for the fuckin' yuppies
Dog kennels. bloodlines, even sold pimp puppies
Mixtapes, high school, crazy money, don't sleep
Bomb squad, bird heads, blast it at a [?] Jeep
Skinny nigga, dark skin, always had bitches though
Light skin hatin' on me, standin' like he pigeon toed
Shot rings, niggas sing loud like the four
No Khaled, no Puff, narcs at your door
It's never over, I'm a younger Hova slash M.O.P., Uncle Murda, Cassanova
Black hoodie, black mask niggas don't want none of that
You say Lox, put greatness in front of that

[Chorus: Styles P & Jadakiss]
They say hip hop is dead but it's never over
They say lyricism is dead but it's never over
Hey, hey!
It's never over, it's never over
Hey, hey!
It's never over, it's never over
Hey, hey!
And if we ever go to war, it ain't never over
They say hip hop is dead but it's never over
They say lyricism is dead but it's never over
Hey, hey!
It's never over, it's never over
Hey, hey!
It's never over, it's never over
Never
And if we ever go to war, it ain't never over
Never, nigga!
It's never over, it's never over
Hey, hey!
It's never over, it's never over
Hey, hey!

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I could go anywhere as long as I got the toast
I do it for the East as long as I got the coast
Go out on my shield as long as I got my oath
And hip hop could never be dead long as I got a pulse
Grown man rap, that's the kiddy section
I was the fly on the wall in the Biggie session
Soaked it all up and spit it out with aggression
Felt a way about it, every sense, with affection
Yeah, you better believe that the bottles is on deck
Haze, glue cookies, gelato is on deck
Never sober, it's never over, we roll out
Twenty one deep in eleven Rovers, head and shoulders
That's where they pointin' them things at
Playin' the game, see how many heads we could bring back
Yeah, at least it be authenic
When you hear them three letters, you know that they represent it
L-O-X

[Outro]
It's never over, it's never over
Hey, hey!
It's never over, it's never over
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
