[Verse 1]
Top of the food chain, It's just the way that I do things
The dungaree seats in the blue Range
I'm working with new change, a Gemini nigga with mood swings
Had the fiends looking for new things
I stopped playin' with birds and started playin' with words
The money wasn't right, so I had to stay on the curb
And I'll be a player later. But for now
Call me pootay 'Kiss, if not that? Montega Jada
I kick hard bars and blow hard weed
And be everywhere, cause I move at God's speed
And my aim is to make y'all bleed
Y'all got embarrassed in the class when the teacher used to make y'all read
Uh-huh, Mind over matter
And that's all good but fuck that
My new shit is spine over bladder
And everybody tryin'a get to the top, and that's all good too
But right now - I'm on the ladder

[Hook]
Look at you then, and (uh-huh)
Look at you now. (yeah)
Don't let this cold cold world,(uh-uhhh)
Bring you down

[Verse 2]
I know your queen got her eyes on me
I got my eyes on your queen, The SMG is Heineken green
Mad thing is you know before long that we gon' get it on
My kit costs thirty and ten to put it on
No tints, windows clean - heavy Windex
Gears on the steering wheel, I shift 'em with my index
Real life - it's just in another form
Kiss of Death, it's about to be another storm
I'm a goddamn raging bull
Stay out of jail by just tellin' myself the cage is full
Got niggas on the payroll, just to squeeze
You're in no position to challenge my expertise
They get a bonus if they leave you
Old school - from the era of the 45's with the penny on the needle
Boss of the bosses, so please don't violate or cross him
Or you'll be the corpse of the corpses

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Uh- Huh, You know the word anger
Is just one letter short of the word danger, and I ain't no stranger
Never use a gat more than twice if you don't clean it
And never say fuck something if you don't mean it
And when it comes to life, the route you've been using thus far ain't working right?
Take the scenic
Whatever faith you got, put in a crook
Wanna hide something from a nigga? Put it in a book
Trust me, this album, the vapour's gon' go around
If you ain't hot, you need paper to throw around
Yeah, it's getting clearer every day
When you wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and say

[Hook]
