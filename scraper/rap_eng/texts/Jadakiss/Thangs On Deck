[Hook - Swerv] x2
I ain't never slip in the thangs is on deck
Put the pressure on them, lames is gonna sweat
Now, I dont care about your name or what you rep
I do my own thang, make it rain you getting wet

[Verse 1 - Swerv]
Im just swerving, tryna get my paper right
Take a flight, hustle all the time, from the day to night
Im on my come up, these cowards wanna take it light
Take a homie I can make it right
Take a quiet trip, nigga to a poppin' block
Burners on deck, perimeter good, got it loud
These dudes is taking in shit real, have 14 shooters in 2 days
Brick city, my mind state is stuck there
Until I get to get away, and get enough air
Try to feel me, so many safari tales
Got the hammers there, homie so we
I dont do a lot of talking, I ain't for words
Smoke my herb, never pay attention to these nerds
Kee it moving if it ain't about fetti talk
Out of line, get my young boy to let the Desi talk

I ain't never slip in the thangs is on deck
Put the pressure on them, lames is gonna sweat
Now, I dont care about your name or what you rep
I do my own thang, make it rain you getting wet

[Verse 2 - Jadakiss]
You can either get cremated or get buried
Id rather hit you once in a head than with a flurry
You ain't gonna suffer so you ain't got to worry
Ima give you that strong shit, doctor Murray
Catch me over the stove, my work of glass
I dont care about your name nigga, first or last
Im just here to damage your future and hurt your past
You just better pray and hope that the nurse is fast
10 toes on the ground so its hard to slip
Motherload from the Mexicans so its hard to flip
Should have learned from
Got the thangs on deck and they large as shit
I do my own thang, something you ain't do yet
No I dont never use a tec, less I use a new tec
I ain't never heard of yall, yall must be a new set
Basically, I dont give a fuck what u rep

[Hook - Swerv] x4
I ain't never slip in the thangs is on deck
Put the pressure on them, lames is gonna sweat
Now, I dont care about your name or what you rep
I do my own thang, make it rain you getting wet
