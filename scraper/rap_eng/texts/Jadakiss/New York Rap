[Intro: Sheek Louch]

LOX!
What's your name again? Donnie G [D BLOCK!]
Who else witchu fam? (SP) [Ayo Poobs!]
Wave the ruger at these haters
This New York Rap who else witchu?

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]

Don Don .38 revolver in a brown bag
Money in the pocket when I walk my pants sag
In and out of town that's why the God look jet lag
Sheek still bangin' and I ain't wavin' a red flag
The curse of Bin Laden, boats dont float across
His ghostly bones said rise up with green moss [oooooohh!]
Uh, Smoke blowin' on a weave
Audie on the sleeve, Louis Vs in the breeze [yeaaaahh!]
Condos in Miami I ain't even use the keys
Women and fast cars, some of my pet peeves [It's OK!]
Cash and big guns be with them OGs
Levis, white ups, city lab tees
Knicks ain't make it, Yanks gotta bring it home [New York!]
The Dirty Harry sittin on me all chrome [oooowwww!]
Public Enemy, welcome to the terrordome
This UK money, my phone stay on roam
Safety on Glock, ice on rock
I rep Biggie since Rick Ross reppin Pac

[Verse 2: Styles P]

I dont like too many rappers, or niggas [I don't]
If you see me talkin to cowards, its all figgas [true]
Gotta be ready to die to war with us [ready to die!]
Yea we three deep but there's plenty of more with us [L-O-X]
Chop it up, bag it up, set it up [all that]
I got a problem on the strip, I wet it up [I wet it up!]
I could get a ton on the arm, get your credit up
Talkin to the pilot on the Palm, then a senator [feel me!]
You fake it nigga I get it shakin [I get it shakin!]
I'll shoot your wife at the dinner table like taken [oooohh]
I did dirt since Krush Groove and Breakin' [dirty nigga]
Now they got a Biggie movie, Pac comin next
You could suck my dick you said the LOX ain't the best [cowards!]
Now yell "pause" and "no homo" that
And get a bullet in your fitted where the logo at [get a bullet in your fitted!]
Yea, another one by the NE sign [NE sign]
Stab him in the face with the pen he signed [stab him]
Now that's that turn your fitted to a snapback

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]

Yo, I'm the one that make the car start, engine
Hard liquor 2 week straight nigga, bingin' [whooo!]
This dope, get your sniff on or syringin'
I'm really in these streets, they pretendin'
You compare him to these creeps, you offend him
Water and oil don't mix, you can't blend them
Trunk full of powder, cook it when I get there
It's me all alone on the throne, yea I sit there
[Tsssss] Now just let the haze burn
Bullets don't never change, they always burn
Majority is snakes, the rest is straight worms
Everybody's a baller, then I must be Dave Stern
Virus, whenever I spit I spray germs [laughing]
Who else been nice for this long and stayed firm? [Who?]
Donnie G, The Phantom and Al Qaeda [Yea]
L-O-X the criminology coordinators [What!?]
