(Intro: Yamine [Future])
Uh, yeah, [If young metro don't trust you I won't shoot you] back in the project man Yamine and T-Pain let's go!

(Hook: Yamine)
When I'm getting up
All that's on my mind is (no stressin) [uh]
When I'm making bread
And counting digits that's (no stressin)[yeah]
I know I've made mistakes
And made some breaks
But all I hope for is (no stressin)[uh]
I'm tired of lies and tired of tries
All I hope for is (no stressin)[Let's get it] (repeat)

(Verse 1: Yamine)
Everytime I make up a verse
I have to pause and rehearse (uh)
Everytime I see my face in the mirror
I say David you as fly as a church [uh]
When I'm in bed all I think of is no person [yeah]
At that time in my mind I can't do anything on purpose [uh]
Never ever testing or stress-in over any woman's purses [yeah]
I'm tired of the lies and I promise you I'll get ride of the curses [yeah]
No more stressin my homie, if you wanna mess with me then go testin my homie [yeah]
All I hope for is a peaceful place with a woman in my face and vest full of cash right next to my safe[uh]
If a person would come and try me I'll spray em with the mace [yeah]
Pull up on the block with a Glock and mop, then erase everything off the case  [uh]
Ace Hooding this rap and triplet flowing like Juicy J
Three 6 Mafia days Memphis boys had them Migos get a taste [uh]

(Hook: Yamine)
When I'm getting up
All that's on my mind is (no stressin) [uh]
When I'm making bread
And counting digits that's (no stressin)[yeah]
I know I've made mistakes
And made some breaks
But all I hope for is (no stressin)[uh]
I'm tired of lies and tired of tries
All I hope for is (no stressin)[Let's get it]
