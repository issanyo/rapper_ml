This is the appreciation
I love you

[Chorus]
How I really feel, How I really feel about you
How I feel about you
How I feel about you, yeah
How I really feel, How I really feel about you
How I feel about you
How I feel about you, yeah

He had a dream that the Feds got 'em
Woke up, went and bought every pair wit the red bottoms
Yep, your new beamer's black
If you ain't on Madison you in Niemans or Saks
At the gym of the salon, food shoppin' with your mom
Over one of your girlfriend's house sippin' wine
Why risk it, when you could come home to a Don
Leave Potsie alone and come roll with the Fonze
Gold metal feels much better than the bronze
You don't have to say nothing I feel your response
You can get the ring and the house too, yeah
Cuz that's how I feel about you

[Chorus]
Slats with the heels, Air Max
Nice pair of sweats and a ponytail just give me the chills
Yeah, we got our own special handshake, mwah
And she know how I like my pancakes
Off white three piece with the tan snakes
Eighty large make her ring finger stand straight
Now I could have a good time wit her
Chill wit me in the spot used to grind wit her
That's on everything I kill for her
Say what you want that's just how I feel for her

[Chorus]
I gotta play it cool, mosaic tiles at the bottom of the pool
I got 'em cuz of you
Washing set, you up under the dryer
Winter time, cuddled up under the fire
Still there after all that I put her through
Don't smoke but sometimes she take a pull or two
I don't know how I would feel without her
I just know how I feel about her

[Chorus]
