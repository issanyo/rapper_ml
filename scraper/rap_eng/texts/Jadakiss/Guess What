[Jadakiss]
Owww... yeah
Keyshia... Jada
You made it ma (made it, made it)

[Chorus: Keyshia]
I'm tired of the bullshit, competin' with these other chicks
You don't know what to do with this you act like you're through but
Guess what, nigga I'm leaving you
And guess what, I'm needin' my keys from you
I was so stupid for love thinkin' you was
Everything a real man can give me and more
But guess not nigga I'm leavin' you
And guess what I'm needin' my keys from you

[Verse 1]
Nigga hears he pho-to I gotcha comin' up out her front door
Thought you had me fast but damn you didn't know
Every time you paged her she would page me and tell me you were there
And that's a no no I let you go for months
Thinkin' so wonderin' why you haven't hit this
In so long I'm a smart bitch
And I gave you the rope and now you're hangin' there
Tell me what in the hell you're thinkin'
Not Keysh being home alone another weekend not Keysh
I let you get away with this nonsense for too long
Ain't gon' be no more callin' this yours

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now you wanna conversate sit back talkin' about the mistakes you made
When I was on your plate nigga now hold yo wait now wasn't you the one sayin'
I guess it's safe to say now every man you meet
Now has a tendency to cheat shame on me
Because if you knew it was the same hold you
To everything you thought she would be stay off me
Tell me what in the hell you're thinkin'
Not Keysh being home alone another weekend not Keysh
I let you get away with this nonsense for too long
Ain't gon' be no more callin' this

[Jadakiss]
Everything I told you I showed you
Everything I promised came true if not boo I owe you
And it's your loss now and it ain't nothin' you now me
I still got the duplex across town you wanna act hard ya
I'ma give you your keys back just give me my platinum and black cards
And I can't lie I'ma miss pullin' your hair
And hittin' it from the back hard uhh guess what
I'm just bein' a man I messed up fortunately I ain't got the best luck
But at the end of the day ask me if I give a less fuck

[Chorus]

[Outro: Keyshia]
So where were you?  Where you been?
You didn't answer your phone
You ain't gotta answer my calls?
So now you gon' try play me
Yo I'm tired of this bullshit!
Get the fuck out !
Take all your shit and get the fuck out!
