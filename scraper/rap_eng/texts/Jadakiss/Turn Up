[Intro: Wale]
DC shit, Double M G
Genius, Folarin
What up Kiss?
Work

[Verse 1: Wale]
Here I'm saying that the game need a resurrection
So I keep it genuine, fresh, and always introspective
This pen and pencil should be a Ginsu, my shit will get through
[?] you bitches foul and we official
Nigga, find a new position
You niggas on the couch without no fucking Jeremy Lin moves
Fast bitches in a slow limo
Rather that 62, but the shits so big, I do forget doe
I could use this tempo
Got a model joint, high heel, she 6'4"
But it don't mean shit though
When a nigga call I bet she gon get low
Ha, DC up to YO
The writer of the ribbon in the sky could see that I'm dope

[Hook: Jadakiss]
Right when everybody else turned down we turn up
Bottles poppin' and we smokin' the loud we turn up
Lookin out and see you wondering how we turn up
By the time they get me poppin and now we turn up, turn up

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Ice T's, one layer players over dungarees
Fresh cut, iced out, true blue number 3s
Everybody smokin' good, we just got a hundred piece
Tryna stay sucka free, still runnin' from the Ds
Ballin' just a hobby homie, we ain't tryna get you mad
Baddest bitches in the world in the lobby catching cabs
Nothin' on the arm, everything paid for in cash
Perforated leather on the seat, suede on the dash
Lotta niggas like to spend, yeah, well I love to stash
Muthafuckin' chopper in the trunk, gloves and the mask
Most niggas get guilt, couple niggas get a pass
A few niggas hit their number right before they hit the gas

[Hook: Jadakiss]
Right when everybody else turned down we turn up
Bottles poppin' and we smokin' the loud we turn up
Lookin out and see you wondering how we turn up
By the time they get me poppin and now we turn up, turn up

[Verse 3: Future]
They watching me like paparazzi
They wanna know if I'm really in Versace
I'm with this bitch, I'm watching hockey
They got my swag on copy
They wanna know my every move
What kind of girls I like, what kind of girls I do
Can't nothin' prepare you for fame, it's not a game
You gotta be mentally sane inside your brain
Any drug that I ever did, I never became
I never let it get the best of me, the stronger I became
Hard as I work you can never take from my name
I'd been in the mud and felt the fire come from the flame
These rappers asking around out of town, did I slang
I can't respond to these comments, I can't convict my game
I talked to Jada one day and knew I had made a change
I used to listen to LOX screaming I bought a Glock
I pledge allegiance to Biggie I'll never talk to cops
I'll make this rapping an easy 3 bands until I drop

[Hook: Jadakiss] x2
Right when everybody else turned down we turn up
Bottles poppin' and we smokin' the loud we turn up
Lookin out and see you wondering how we turn up
By the time they get me poppin and now we turn up, turn up
