[Verse 1 Jadakiss]
I'm Stuck in the trap, but I'm loving the money
I was smart enough to know not to fuck with the dummies
If I ain't up in the spot, then I'm up in a honey
Straight 12 hour shifts with nothing but twenties
I got no patience, and I hate waiting
I send niggas on permanent vacations
We ain't even that deep, it's just eight patients
We out here on these streets and we straight caking
Yeah, pop a bottle then burn an L
I get familiar with the circuit, then I work it well
You ain't got the man power, or the personnel
Be the last one to shoot, and the first to tell
Just a wet stop, I'm with the best stops
Flow nasty, like the bathrooms at the rest stops (ew)
Four fifth and a black cargoes
Just ask Rob Zoe, kisses the black Pablo

[Chorus: Anthiny King]
Live for today
And forget tomorrow
Prosper for the moment
Tomorrow is never promised to us
Live for today like it’s your last

[Verse 2 Bun B]
Waking up to somebody's same bullshit
Haters wanna gun me down with a full clip
Bitches here to take me away from my queen
And random dick riders tryna sneak it to the team
There's +No New Friends+, just like the song said
Especially when you're dealing with real long bread
You better be lion hearted, with a strong head
Ready to leave your enemies where they belong, dead!
The power of the paper is a life changer
But the power of the pussy is a wife changer
You gotta know just what you're getting into
But you can't know 'bout shit that you ain't been through
Walking through the jungle, I try to blend in
Preparing myself for whoever they gone send in
And if I sin, then may Father forgive me
Man, I'm just prayn that my children outlive me
On some real shit!

(Hook)
Live for today
And forget tomorrow
Prosper for the moment
Tomorrow is never promised to us
Live for today like it’s your last

[Verse 3 Fabolous]
Amateurs built the ark, pros built the Titanic
The worst times bring out your best, nigga, why panic?
I need cash out of this world I'm tryna buy planets
The risk big, the reward gotta be gigantic
This the point in my life
I realize how you live after you die is just as important as life
One of my killas told me he disappointed with life
And he don't trust nothin' but his joint and his knife
So he just livin' for the day cause
Niggas snakes and be givin' it away
When the leave, they be slitherin' away
I be chauffeured driven in the Maybach
Bumpin' 'Can I Live" that old Jay track
They should lock up all the suckers and bring real niggas home
They should call me gangsta Hughes, I write real nigga poems
Like, roses are red, the new hundreds are blue
Y'all are finished like the line when I do run into you
You better live for the day!"

(Hook)
Live for today
And forget tomorrow
Prosper for the moment
Tomorrow is never promised to us
Live for today like it’s your last

[Verse 4 Rob Zoe]
Nowadays, you gotta walk with a Beretta
See the G's, red and green, double letters
I hit the block and kill the pop, that's my agenda
These niggas working and these hoes won't make it betta
I'm ready, I'm ready, I hit 'em up, like the return of Machiavelli
I'm getting money ain't shit that you can tell me
Turn the block to Elm Street, like I was Freddy
These niggas jealous
I got a kilo from Titto, but I ain't tellin'
They wanna put a bullet in my cerebelum
Just cause they heard I was the man, I want 11
In a flash, it could be yur last
Know some niggas in they 30, living in the past
And never tell a soul where you keep your stash
It can be your own homie coming with a mask
