[Jadakiss]
Hey yo Part 2 AI and Jadakiss presenting the A6 from the wrist
Can tell it's a straight swish
Now I'm the problem and he's the Answer
Soon as you try to guard up you ain't got a chance to stop it
Any given time he can pop it
The Reebok A6 is hot go cop it!

[Allen Iverson]
For 2K3 I rock the A6 my new kicks
Take a few hits, it ain't nothin I'm used to it
Tryin' to build a team I'm the player ya need
Heart like Willis Reed top thief and scorer in the league

[Jadakiss]
There's no way to disguise your dream
Besides family the only thing on his mind now is a ring
He got love for the game his start was huge
And you seen him play hurt cause he has heart is huge
Six foot 165 call Iso anytime he want he'll split your 5
He play to win he don't play for stats
Brought the hood to the game, and they love him for the braids and tats
Yeah Trackmasters AI and Jadakiss
Make sure you go out and get a pair of the A6!
