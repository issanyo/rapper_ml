[Hook: Dyce Payne]
I figured I'd ride with you
Cruise up and ride with you
Smoke a little lye with you
If it's alright with you
'Cause we got big shit to talk about
(Talk about it)
Like how we gon' make it out
(Make it out)
I think I got it all figured out
(Figured out)
'Cause there's a body in the parking lot
Hallelujah savior

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
It's my behavior with the razor make 'em call on a savior
All that p89 rubber grip with the lazer
If I'm riding I'm a gun hold nigga
Pretty quiet, but in a riot I'm strapped like "let's go, nigga"
Easy peasy, young of that easy geazy
Mango madness, felt like I was sipping Weezy
Big shit to talk about
Mans in the bank before my son get married
Oh, I ain't even gonna walk 'em out
Act funny, chalk 'em out we don't play
Streetsweeper and a duffel bag wherever we stay
Had these niggas turning on each other, turning me gray
All money ain't good money, we turn 'em away

[Hook: Dyce Payne]
I figured I'd ride with you
Cruise up and ride with you
Smoke a little lye with you
If it's alright with you
'Cause we got big shit to talk about

Like how we gon' make it out
(Make it out)
I think I got it all figured out
(Figured out)
'Cause there's a body in the parking lot
Hallelujah savior

[Verse 2: Styles P]
I figured out I'd ride with you
Smoke a little lye with you
I know you got the nine with you
I could get a nigga line with you
Blow out a nigga mind with you
It's no talking to the swine with you
It's G code to do the time with you
Why you think I'd do a crime with you?
If it's fine with you
We got big shit to talk about, everybody get set straight
Yeah, I'm talking mansions, Europeans and jet planes
Pretty bitches by the pool daily
Gotta cruise with the tools 'cause these jewels worth a few milli

[Hook: Dyce Payne]
I figured I'd ride with you
Cruise up and ride with you
Smoke a little lye with you
If it's alright with you
'Cause we got big shit to talk about
(Talk about it)
Like how we gon' make it out
(Make it out)
I think I got it all figured out
'Cause there's a body in the parking lot
Hallelujah savior

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yeah, if one ride they all ride
All around the world with the family, no tour guide
I could line base with the family, no fluoride
It ain't gon' take you to dare me for y'all to all die
Yeah, they still loving the performance
Stash and accounts, all of it is enormous
Had to stay on point 'cause they wasn't gonna warn us
Only 3-men group where all of them is the strongest
Hah, we got big shit to talk about
If you see the wine in the glass you know the cork is out
If you see the mink down to my ass you know the hawk is out
Soon as you hear the three letters you know New York is out

[Hook: Dyce Payne]
I figured I'd ride with you
Cruise up and ride with you
Smoke a little lye with you
If it's alright with you
'Cause we got big shit to talk about
