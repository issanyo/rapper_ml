[Refrain: The Notorious B.I.G.]
And we've waded through the suffering and pain
The bitches ride the dick like the A-train
That's why I flip
Keep a burner to my hip
Take a hooker to the crib, you know she got to strip
Stay dipped, take out of state trips
Don't drink a lot of Hennessy, I only take a sip
I'm a skipper, like a captain, rappin' is my speciality
And the best is me

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
You're lucky I don't run you over in the SUV
And if you feel some kind of way you can S-M-D
Me, Fizzy and the King, that's a special three
Far as money, less you work, the less you see
Put hands on 'em, they just wanna S-U-E
You could never do what I can do unless you me
'Cause dog I'm a low cat
I bring that dope back
No matter how they feel about me, just let 'em know that

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
I got love for New York City, New York City
And they got love for me and B-I-G
They always gon' hold us down
We got that work in New York City
Where they be talkin' real fast, all about the cash
New York City, New York City

[Refrain: The Notorious B.I.G.]
And we've waded through the suffering and pain
The bitches ride the dick like the A-train
That's why I flip
Keep a burner to my hip
Take a hooker to the crib, you know she got to strip
Stay dipped, take out of state trips
Don't drink a lot of Hennessy, I only take a sip
I'm a skipper, like a captain, rappin' is my speciality
And the best is me

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Remember me and you smokin' in the Lexus Jeep
And you schoolin' me on how to bless these streets
Told me to, "Get your money, Kiss, F these beefs"
Get your paperwork right and you can catch these thieves
The game is forever a part of me
'Cause as far as NYC, I'm the main artery
Nobody parallel or even half as smart as me
You was just a draft pick, I was a lottery
It's still love

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
I got love for New York City, New York City
And they got love for me and B-I-G
They always gon' hold us down
We got that work in New York City
Where they be talkin' real fast, all about the cash
New York City, New York City

[Outro: The Notorious B.I.G. + Jadakiss]
And we've waited through the suffering and pain
B.I
And bitches ride the dick like the A-train
Fizzy
And we've waited through the suffering and pain
Jada
And bitches ride the dick like the A-train
We got that work
And we've waited through the suffering and pain
We made it
And bitches ride the dick like the A-train
Get off me
And we've waited through the suffering and pain
And bitches ride the dick like the A-train
We got that work, baby
B.I.G
NYC
B.I.G
Forever hold us down
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, Biggie
Love y'all
B.I.G
Yeah
B.I.G
