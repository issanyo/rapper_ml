[Chorus: Remo]
Wake up in the morning
I gotta go and get a bag
Momma need it real bad
I gotta go and get a bag
Bag, bag
Shit I gotta go and get a bag
Twentys, Fiftys, Hundreds
Gotta go and get a bag

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Dior, Gucci, Rari, two seat
She's a movie, but means nothing to me
A-list singer and she's just a groupie
Rockstar lifestyle I mean that truly
Mick Jagger skinny iconic in these slim pants
Smile big, and watch the diamonds do the thizz dance
Use me for motivation, you be helped by it
I put twenty in my teeth because I felt like it
My number one is making sure that mom's straight
My whole family eating off of this plate
A long list of all the people I provide for
Time is money and it's all that I'm having time for

[Chorus: Remo]
Wake up in the morning
I gotta go and get a bag
Momma need it real bad
I gotta go and get a bag
Bag, bag
Shit I gotta go and get a bag
Twentys, Fiftys, Hundreds
Gotta go and get a bag

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Right now losing ain't one of my options
Neither is the gun and the ski mask concoction
And if you balling for the raw better patch the locks in
I'm a grown man, I don't bust down my watches
Death is a guarantee, that's for certain
Faith in God, but the devil won't stop lurking
Naw, the goyard or the birkin
If you don't come home with the bag, don't stop working (don't stop)
Yeah, instead of just getting blunted (uh huh)
Use that energy to go get it bad as you want it (get it)
Hand start itching, you feel it. That mean it's coming (coming)
Then you fill a bag up with the Twentys, Fiftys and Hunnids (what)

[Chorus: Remo]
Wake up in the morning
I gotta go and get a bag
Momma need it real bad
I gotta go and get a bag
Bag, bag
Shit I gotta go and get a bag
Twentys, Fiftys, Hundreds
Gotta go and get a bag

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Yeah, uh
Cuz this money not 'gon make itself
Rio De Janeiro 'cuz its all about where you take yourself
Been around the world getting bags, tryna make this wealth
Pray for prosperity, and love, and we pray for health
I need a 150k just for a walkthrough
But hit my agent bruh, I'm not the guy to talk to
My rate is non-negotiable, you either buy or walk
I got no time to talk, the bags are coming by the flock
I'm never off, I'm working 5'o clock to 5'o clock
I do my job until the day that I'm outlined in chalk
I told my self, 'One day this shit will finally pop'
Fuck everybody, I'mma climb the top
Yeah

[Chorus: Remo]
Wake up in the morning
I gotta go and get a bag
Momma need it real bad
I gotta go and get a bag
Bag, bag
Shit I gotta go and get a bag
Twentys, Fiftys, Hundreds
Gotta go and get a bag

[Outro]
Shit I gotta go and get a bag
Gotta go and get a bag
