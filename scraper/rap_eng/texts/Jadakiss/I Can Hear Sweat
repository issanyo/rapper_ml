[Verse 1: Freeway]
Three niggas, two nines apiece
We just tryna eat
So we fry the beef
We are the streets
My nigga young and from there
He there, Coco, beware
We will junk yard dog on your beats
Trap niggas make rap niggas call police
Sweep the ratchet make Al Sharpton call for peace
Even Funk Flex said it "Free you are a beast"
We wilin' in these streets 'til the day that Sig's released
Young Freezer the block leader
The rap star that pop heaters
The bearded lot is here to lock the rap game
Some say I am not sane
Those that know me say "Freezer you have not changed
Even though you switched from getting block change, you still G"
Trap star Freezer
Squeeze off ninas
Was hustling you was reading books 'bout Tom Sawyer
Nickel nine for your trouble
If you try to interrupt us while we hustle you will leave here a bleeder
Short se√±orita
Not faithful, she's a cheater
Part-time wife, part-time dick eater
Niggas tryna creep
Run up on my Jeep
We don't only sing it
We bring it where you sleep

[Hook]
I can hear sweat (x10)
Trickling down your cheek
I can hear sweat (x10)
Trickling down your cheek

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Sweat trickling down your cheek is a sign of fear
Symbolizing your time is near
Yeah, especially when the toasters is right here
The objects in the mirror are closer than they appear
He don't even know that they peeping him through the scope
So scared you can see his heart beating right through his coat
Do him dirty and put a .30-30 right through his throat
Send the footage to Diddy let him premiere it on Revolt
Coming out of the sky, aerial assault
I recommend you keep some pallbearers on call
Kingpins usually get a mural on the wall
Regular niggas get a couple candles and that's all
They're similar, compare it
If the shoe fits, wear it
Money in the bank, dice game tryna air it
One clip, two niggas want it, let 'em share it
All you niggas is sweating, I can see it, I can hear it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freeway]
All eyes on me
Yeah nigga, all eyes on me
Yeah nigga, all eyes on me
All eyes on me
Today I push the Beamer 750 but I used to want the GS3, want the GS3
Yeah, I spit the gift like St. Nick, add Nicholas like EST
Shout out to EST
Them niggas want to spray me
Can't fade me, can't play me like the PS3 (PS3)
Fuckboys ready to die, if you ain't bout that life then let us be
Little nigga better let us be
Think I'm bluffing but I got an appetite for destruction
Motherfuckers better let us eat, better let us eat
Vegetarian, I get to the lettuce
They never jam so I pick the berettas
Back in '98 I had to stick the connect up
For the simple fact you wouldn't let us re
Remember the time I was gone 'til November?
The cops had us locked, they wouldn't let us free
I remember when the people wouldn't let us see
Now the people won't let us breathe, won't let us breathe
I remember when the people wouldn't let us come
Now the people won't let us leave
We riders, and every time they think that they doubt us
We got another trick up our sleeve

[Outro]
We got the streets on lock down
We got the streets on lock down
We got the streets on lock
I think they love me like Pac now
I think they love me like Pac now
I think they love me like Pac
All eyes on me
