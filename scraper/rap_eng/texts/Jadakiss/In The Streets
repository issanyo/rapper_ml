(I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)
I'm in these streets, hustlin' every day
(I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)

Yo, I'm on the block faithfully
Got it so good if I'm late they'll wait for me
Mama please pray for me
The devil does things in the worst ways
In the ER waiting to hear what the nurse say
I dun' payed for more funerals than birthdays
Finish a whole one and a half by Thursday (word)
So just imagine what I'm sittin' with
And I ain't splittin' it, I'm out here gettin' it

[Chorus]
I'm in these streets, (I'm in the streets getting money)
I can't get away (I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)
I'm in these streets, (I'm in the streets getting money)
Hustlin' everyday (I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)

Organization is smooth and ran with a tight lip
Get rid of the work, hold the bread with a tight grip
Trust fund baby in the cut with a white chick
Was in a choke hold, now its in a vice grip
And even though my arm still strong with the dices
Drug dealer, I don't do jooks or heists
The fame is alright but the game is priceless
My heart beating but I'm still out here lifeless

[Chorus]
Start off with a wish if you wanna grant shit
I was never a worker, I always ran shit (true)
They was doin' shelves, I did the stand smiths
My hair used to be nappier than Durant's shit
Where they got the work at, and how much the grams is
Build it up to a key that's what the plan is
You ain't got no fam just you and your manses
Out here taking penitentiary chances

[Chorus]
I'm in these streets, hustlin' every day
