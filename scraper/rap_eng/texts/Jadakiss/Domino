[Chorus]
But she was a lover, and I was a fighter
Yeah yeah, didn't make a whole lot of sense right from the start ooh
I was in my daydream walking, head up in the clouds like woah woah woah
She was doing damn near nothing I just had to let her know
So I told her, I was falling head over heels
Domino, domino (2x)
So I told her...

[Verse 1: Dan Major]
Shawty she a good girl, leave you with some bad thoughts
Had me playing smooth like the keys up in the jazz drop
Now she reppin' hard for me, something like a mascot
Said she see the star in me, tell her Ima blast off
And I never seen nothin' like her
Every king need a queen like every ring need a fighter
You could.. [?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I was fallin' head over heels
I mean what I say and I said how I feel
Sometime the fake get misled by the real
And be all stressed out up in the bed taking pills
All I need is a dutch, dub, and a lighter (lighter)
You already know she a lover, Ima fighter (fighter)
It didn't make a lot of sense but I was always right beside her uh
I was just hoping that the bond would get tighter
And just outta the respect uh
Money comin' in now, I'm the new connect (me)
If you gon come make sure you come correct
Cause I'm head over heels now domino effect

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Peter Jackson]
Back to back.. [?]
Back to back my club money no object
Bottle after bottle, that champagne by the swimming pool
Mama got that look in her eye like she was too cool
She got me head over heels baby I'm no fool
She got me spendin' this paper like there was no rules
She got me dreamin' bout everything that I wan do
I can't front look baby I'm so into you
I know what girls want [?] want a bad man
Tiffany diamonds, 5th ave on the right hand
First class, nine course on a foreign land
Private flights, her heart beating like marching bands
I mean... Is this everything you dreamed of?
She want a bad boy that clean up well, bloood
Well I give her everything she dreamt of
XOXO mad love

[Chorus]
