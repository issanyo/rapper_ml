Game wasn't half bad until the faggots came
Got the weed man meeting me at baggage claim
Been the same way never has the status changed
So when I tell you I love you that explains
Why I'm trying to get the pesos, moving the ye slow
Sam Quentin bars with the Pelican Bay flow
Tougher than a lackey, chucks and the khakis
Representing for niggas chino to ??? ???
Sales took a decline I got the dope workin'
Who else better to be the hood spokesperson
Knife to the neck got your throat squirtin'
Hopefully you dead on arrival closed curtains
Ya, I'm a be in the red faded
Rip a Dre track like I was there when he made it
Everywhere you look I'm right there and you hate it
If it's good then cop it I don't care what the weight is
It could happen so don't chance him
I make goon music and they all anthems
Some niggas pay bills some niggas pay ransoms
I don't just sell my bricks I advance 'em
I don't just break new artists I enhance 'em
Any time I'm with the devil I'm dancin
Ya, I got extra jewels on
A lot of these niggas be pussy plus they move wrong
That's why they be the dudes that get moved on
Big picture of them when they turn the news on
Work comin from The Bay and from Towson
In case a nigga get in the way you know what to do to 'em
Move on to the next mission
I'm gettin money though nah I ain't set trippin'
I'm just sayin that's what it is
You ain't going to have a problem paying if you love the kids
Bar shit homey
In the Beverly center with the four fifth homey
I was holding a cig
East side 400 strong over the bridge
Dust jewels too powerful to go in the fridge
I'm a go in your girl's mouth then go in her ribs
Besides money I ain't bring shit
Except for the 3 piece and the wing tips
Pockets square and the ????
You know what it is, it's that time Lord
