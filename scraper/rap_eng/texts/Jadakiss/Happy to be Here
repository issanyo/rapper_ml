This for the babies, the bums, the crackheads, the ex-convicts
C'mon
Its another one, I'm just happy to be here

I ain't Hollywood, but the hood put me first
So I don't worry about nothin cuz it could be worse
Good things come to those that wait
Hot things come to those that hate, I know you can relate
I keep nothing less than a hundred grand upstairs
My conversations is deep with the man upstairs
I'll be rappin to y'all, he be rappin to me
So at the end of the day I'm just happy to be
Look, I dont need a Grammy, only thing I need
To make history is a budget and the Dean family
Firearm close to the jock
My life's just like a verse, I dont punch though, I go from the top
Shit just happen I ain't plan it
I'm thankful though and won't take shit for granted
So all that greasy talkin y'all can can it
Bottom line 'Kiss is the champ, understand it

[Hook]

I'm just happy to be here (I'm just happy to be here yo..I'm just happy to be here ya know?)
I'm just happy to be here (I'm just happy to be here yo..I'm just happy to be here ya know?)

Yo I'm just happy to be here
When I went to get some sneakers they gave me a free pair
And I got a hoodie n jeans (so what?)
So I gotta slide through Brooklyn then boogie through Queens
Then I head to Harlem and the Bronx
Then I'm on a first-class flight to Miami tomorrow
Hit the club then the strip club
They pop off pop E, I smoke weed and get my motherfuckin dick sucked
Then I hit both of the liners
Show ID cuz Kiss ain't hittin a minor (nuh uh)
Now I'm in the A-T-L
Get loose, get crunk, get drunk at the one-one-deuce
And niggas know J gotta go to LA cuz ain't nothin like some Cali weed
Then I'mma rent a Lamborghini, take a trip to the bay and hit Webber on the cell cuz they playin today

[Hook]

C'mon, lets get it on, lets do it
I'mma show you how the K-I-double S do it
I learned to enhance the pain, so I can't complain
Now that I understand the game
And I got loot too, but so what?
I be in the hood often, y'all just shoot through
We do it all, pull them thangs out, fight
Freestyle off the head sit down and write
And the world ain't ready for this outfit of our
The burners, the jewelry, the houses, the cars
Anybody with ears can bounce with the bars
I'm the hottest rapper out come and bounce with the god
Time's up, kiss the game goodbye
Nines up when I came for mine
So makeway for the new don
23's on the Yukon
All that shit that you've seen on the cover of the DuPont

(Chorus x5)
