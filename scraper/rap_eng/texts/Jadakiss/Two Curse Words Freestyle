Scared of pain so you fear hurt
Ion celebrate til the bodies near dirt
Go to hell they gon tell you I was there first
Every opponent will tell you I was their worst
Having bad hungry pains and severe thirst
Have you earth in all black in a red hearse
Hmmm, too sticky to let the drama slide
And the sight of the blood will leave you traumatized
I can't do no wrong least in my mama's eyes
I go a gun in the trunk that's lil mama's size
That boy died from vocal-hicular homicide
The voice the flow the way he harmonize
Those that's real see the truth beyond the lies
In real life I'm living proof we on the rise , yeah
I was too smart to play with the dummies
Rather you kill yourself and save me the money
From the bottom ion mind if you pay me in twenties
They pop a lot of shit but as soon as you see them they mummies
Ha ha ha you guys is funny
We fresh as death they alive and bummy
Plug told me three words : supply the country
I told him that the bullets in the 45 is chunky
That's why they say you can never get to comfy
Trips outta town my lump sum comes monthly
Might as well all team up and come jump me
This is uneven I'm the only one breathing
Everybody gets their turn it's sun season
I'm only here for that paper one reason
Nobody cares tho everybody a weirdo
Dudes watching your back tell me who watching theirs tho?
All you gon see is the fire from out of the air hose
Stick up kids get the desire they hit your ear lobes
Left lane all you hear is my gears yo
Crown been in my closet for a couple of years yo
Ok, enough with the foolery
And the costume jewelry
Ain't much you can do to me, nah
The art of war ain't new to me
Lil nigga you better Google me
The city was mine after they said Big's eulogy
Ah man , hahaha
