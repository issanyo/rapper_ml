[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Why they always talking about money?
Cause we like money bitch
Yeah, yeah, yeah
L-O-X and we won't stop
Bad Boy, I'm a show you how we get this money

[Verse 1: Styles P]
You can't take this, players hate this
Rainbow glow, European bracelet
Made his mouth drop, now he need a face lift
Mommies run up on me and ask me to taste it
Hands on my crotch
Got to be the sales or the band on my watch
Damn I'm so hot! They call me arrogant
While you slide with seven mommies in a Caravan
You start traveling, I'll make you a believer
Hidin in the club getting brain from a diva
Leave with a beezer
Black Cadillac riding with an old geezer
With ten different hustles so every foe sees us
No reason, we just peas in a pod
Trying to get the paper, we the Gs in the lot
Long as the water boil we bound to keep it hot
It's gon' be turmoil if you thinking that it's not

[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
I'm a show you how you get this money (Make it hot)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Don't stop)
I'm a show you how you get this money (I fucks wit you)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Get money)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Make it hot)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Don't stop)
I'm a show you how you get this money (I fucks wit you)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Get money)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Three fly cats that get money with go gimmicks
Y'all just so timid, my soldiers be no limit
What you know about renting a yacht with twenty jet-skis
And riding out till the Coast Guard come and get me
Beat that! Me, Stylez, and Sheek be like 4, 5, 6
So no matter what you roll you, can't beat that
Who you know could take an old record and flip like Puff?
From small clubs to arenas, who rip like us?
Every time they pull up, whips be plush
Chicks be tough, Bad Boy, Hits R Us
Back, it's me, West Indies, Slimmy, me and Kimmy
And I taught her how to say, "May I have a steady gimme"
I ain't bustin cause we picked up them joints you tossed
Y'all was hot until The Lox came and cooled y'all off
It's the Kiss, are you hearing me? I think I'm blessed lyrically
Mad rappers with three LP's sill fearing me

[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
I'm a show you how you get this money (Make it hot)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Don't stop)
I'm a show you how you get this money (I fucks wit you)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Get money)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Make it hot)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Don't stop)
I'm a show you how you get this money (I fucks wit you)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Get money)

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
You see, we bounce on tracks like bas-ketball
And bust down songs till our throat need Halls
L-O-X-pedition, I spend all day fishing and won't catch one
Just me and mami out in the sun, just sailing
Chain so icy if I threw it up, you think it was hailing
Don't even ask me what the price be
To go to a show, no clubs just arenas
Headliner Stevie Wonder, no small cat between us
After parties be goin like Venus
My chick gots be the meanest
Before I come, that night, if she ain't she ain't partying right
That's how we like to play in Bad Boys with all the fly shit
And that's how we do the chips kid
Multiplying, beef, don't apply it
Please don't try it cause we ain't with that
But if so you gon' need a plastic bag where your shit at
Lox and we got that cash you want to get at

[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
I'm a show you how you get this money (Make it hot)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Don't stop)
I'm a show you how you get this money (I fucks wit you)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Get money)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Make it hot)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Don't stop)
I'm a show you how you get this money (I fucks wit you)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Get money)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Make it hot)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Don't stop)
I'm a show you how you get this money (I fucks wit you)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Get money)
