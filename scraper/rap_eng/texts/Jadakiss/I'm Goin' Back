[Hook: Nesha]
I'm going back to the way (yeah)
The way I used to be (uh-huh)
I got no love for these niggas (naw)
Cause they ain't got love for me (uh-uh)
I'm going back to the way (yeah)
The way I used to be (uh-huh)
With no love for these niggas (naw)
Cause they ain't got love for me yeah (uh, yeah)

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yo I don't go to church much but I need Him a lot
And the Ryde is Ruff that's why I got D on my Block
So you can't even get it unless I give it to you hard
And everybody don't get a dap, some niggas get a nod
I done brung niggas shopping
Brung niggas touring
Those with high bails came home by the morning
Kept niggas with Nikes on niggas lights on
Not on no sucka shit trying to make it right for them
Then you try to show 'em shit
The average nigga don't appreciate nothing so
All that shit is over with
Entourage light up more shooters than fighters
People that's there to work instead of there to divide us
No more royalties, lawyer fees
The less headaches it is
More for me
I'm a grown man
It took me a minute to figure out
My career is in my own hand

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, as far as the industry goes
Everybody's a foe
Only a friend when they want you to flow
I done came straight off the plane into another mans session
And spit pain and ain't charge him a thing
Had to make my line of respect real thinner
Started getting real hungry
I needed a real dinner
Send whoever you want, I'm kissing them all
Did a track with everybody except Mr. Shakur
To me a plaque ain't nothing
But some shit for the wall
And I ain't hating on the people who got 'em
I got a lot of 'em
But I don't got the money they got
So I ain't proud of 'em
I'm proud of me
Cause only I can get the guts out of me (what)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Even though I'm strong
The bullshit be still penetrating
It ain't nothing personal y'all
I'm just ventilating
It was starting to make me tense
How I put a dent in the game
And came back to make more dents
More than one hand on the gun
Just makes more prints
The older I get
The Bible starts to make more sense
When I drive by and give you the horn
I ain't flip, I'm just handling my business
And keeping it going
Instead of pieces, I'm getting the lumps for real for real
And get a nigga ass like I did from the jump
Cause usually a problem would help
And you always gonna need somebody
But all you got is yourself that's why

[Hook]
