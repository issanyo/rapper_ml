Yeah you know how we do it, Funk Flex, Big Kap, Def Jam
The Tunnel, Ruff Ryders, Let's go baby

[Hook]
Ruff Ryders (We in here!)
Ruff Ryders (We stay in here!)
Ruff Ryders (Ain't goin nowhere
Ain't hidin nowhere, ain't runnin nowhere)

[Drag-On]
Ya'll laughin, when we comin, we checkin the cabinets
Body parts we baggin, we ain't comin for the crack
We come to crack backs and ? over niggas hair dew
Split waves, pop off ceasars and graze niggas fades
I creep in a Mustang, bust my heat in the rain
Till they get a rust stain
Y'all niggas heard of me, probably wanna murder me
I'll pull up on ya block and turn your white teeth burgundy
Let's see some surgery

[EVE]
Watch the first lady as she rides
Rougher than the rest of them bitches
What it take for cats to hush they mouth
This one official
Come on clown prove it's still an issue
Streets is ours, have ya homies grieving cause they miss you
Thought it was a game when I said the dogs would get you
Heard you fucked up cause E-V-E bit you
Flex knows what the real is
That's why he deal wit
Ruff Ryders baby droppin bombs nigga feel this

[Hook]
Ruff Ryders (We in here!)
Ruff Ryders (We stay in here!)
Ruff Ryders (Ain't goin nowhere
Ain't hidin nowhere, ain't runnin nowhere)

[Jadakiss]
While ya'll braggin, I'm over here choppin and baggin
And I don't want the drop coupe so I'm choppin the wagon
Dark navy blue six speed, six air-bags
Even if this shit crash, feel like Six Flags
And ya'll niggas can't block my shells
When I'm in jail the C.O. don't lock my cell
Before any rap group, we was the L.O.X. crooks
I'll slap a hundred dollars on the whole blocks books
And know the block shook, when I walk by
Niggas just like you they rather not look
I inspired y'all niggas to flow
I'mma always get money so I admire ya'll niggas that blow
Ask ya self who the nicest out right now
Put your ice up lets get on the mic right now
Clown, I'm the top cat where it stops at
Where lightning and thunder at
And y'all niggas is under that

[Styles]
If you want it with the P. you gonna get your turn
Tuck my gun while its hot to feel my dick hair burn
Might come through the spot with the shottie and wop
Body the block and hop on the Ducati and rocks
I ain't never drive a bike but I ride on the back
Rob wit a gat, shit I still ride wit my craps
If you wanna go to war we can tally it up
Escalade and Denali it up, what?

[Hook]
Ruff Ryders (We in here!)
Ruff Ryders (We stay in here!)
Ruff Ryders (Ain't goin no where
Ain't hidin no where, ain't runnin no where)

[Sheek]
If you like Sheek, you hold heat and no one know
Bust yo' gun leave the body where no one go
I pack some shit for any type of situation
Only time I don't pack heat is on vacation
And that's the blow dryer next to the Playstation
I'm big but I use shit to kill you quick
And I don't wrestle unless a chicks in bed on my dick
Flex know I bring somethin hot to the spot

[DMX]
What would you rather have the 10 you found or the 5 you earned
Became a man at 6 cause at 5 you learned
Don't take nothin for granted except death
Man of the house cause you the last nigga left
See how it's going dizzy with the shit so we can blast a rhyme
Hope the Lord got your soul cause your ass is mine
Every time you turn around niggas know that I be right there
East turned to West coast, cravin for the nightmare
Don't give a fuck about what you sling
Cause you ain't slingin that shit, or bringin that shit
Up the hill, but you still singin that shit
Talkin shit like you know what its like to walk this shit
Get on some stalkin shit
So you know what niggas rule New York and shit
I'm just thinkin all the business and how to handle ya'll niggas
All the families that I got lightin candles for niggas
Grieving relatives, grandmothers falling out and needing sedatives
Moms huggin the casket wishin that she raised a better kid

[Swizz Beatz]
Y'all niggas actors
I'll put your face where your muthafuckin back was
Im tired of y'all niggas actors
Y'all know what y'all gonna get
And y'all niggas know damn well who y'all fuckin wit
Little slim nigga like me, big gun like this
And my gun bust and gun never miss
I'm the nigga that make ya miss Christmas
When we go to court you know shit dismissed

[Hook] x4
