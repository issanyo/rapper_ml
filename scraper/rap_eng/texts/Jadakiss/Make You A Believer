[Intro: Cassie]
I'll tell you what I want (oh-oh)
I'll make you a believer

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Ain't no telling where I'ma take you
Nah, I ain't asking you to believe me cuz I'ma make you
When I'm up, I'm up, when I'm down, I make do
Now I'm just making an entrance, I break through
The blade or the Glock, ice, grape juice
Lemonade and Ciroc, I made for the block
Flow on top of the voices like the bow on top of the Royce
You ain't got no choice, c'mon

[Verse 2: Cassie]
I don't want love, keep your heart
Gimme your time, your body, boy
I don't need money (money), I got my own
Gimme your sex appeal, so I can take you home
Oh, I'ma make you a believer

[Pre-Hook: Cassie]
(Paradise) I'ma show you what paradise look like, damn right
(Damn right) I can make it go on all night, all night
(All night) Oh, I'ma make you a believer
You wanna ride my rollercoaster?

[Hook: Cassie]
Don't you wanna ride it? Let me take you ride it (My playground)
Don't you wanna ride it? Ride it? (Oh, we can go all night)
Don't you wanna ride it?
I got toys for the boys
Take a tour, look around
My playground
I'll make you a believer

[Post-Hook: Cassie]
I'll make you a believer, so tell me whatchu want (oh-oh)
I'll make you a believer

[Verse 3: Cassie]
If you want fun (fun), call my name
I'll be your guard, your party, boy
If you gon' come (come), let me know
Are you gonna wait in line, but I'ma start the show
Oh, I'ma make you a believer

[Pre-Hook: Cassie]
(Paradise) I'ma show you what paradise look like, damn right
(Damn right) I can make it go on all night, all night
(All night) Oh, I'ma make you a believer
(You wanna ride?) You wanna ride my rollercoaster?

[Hook: Cassie]
Don't you wanna ride it? Let me take you ride it (My playground)
Don't you wanna ride it? Ride it? (Wanna ride it boy?)
(We can go all night) Don't you wanna ride it?
I got toys for the boys
So take a tour, look around
My playground
(I) I'll make you a believer

[Bridge: Cassie]
I'll be your conductress
I might bite a lil bit but
Don't you stress, just get undressed
It's to show you won't forget you only get one try
But you can get back in line, I don't mind
I'll make you a believer

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Yo, for me the sky's the limit
Them other guys is timid
The next pitch could decide the pennant
So I'm swinging for the fences tryna win it
I'm in the 2010 Bentley, ganja scented
Hard for them to believe that the guard was in it
That's the reason why one of my cars is the [?]
Gorgeous shotgun just to compliment 'em
Figured out what she love, it's the Yonkers in 'em
Three quarter LVs just to stomp you with 'em
But the [?] is gone and the [?] is missing
Listen, life ain't a bitch, it's a book you should read her
You need her, cause she'll make you a believer (wha)

[Hook: Cassie]
Don't you wanna ride it? Let me take you ride it (My playground)
Don't you wanna ride it? Ride it? (Let me take you ride it, my playground)
(We can go all night) Don't you wanna ride it? (All night)
I got toys for the boys
Take a tour, look around
My playground
I'll make you a believer

[Outro: Cassie]
I'll make you a believer, so tell me whatchu want (oh-oh)
I'll make you a believer, so tell me whatchu want (oh-oh)
I'll make you a believer, so tell me whatchu want (oh-oh)
I'll make you a believer, so tell me whatchu want (oh-oh)
