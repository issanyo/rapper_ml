[Hook: Ex.od.us]
I hopped in the cutlass
I hopped out a bucket
I pop like I pulled out my weight in some luggage
These hoes steady buggin'
My phone steady buzzin'
I think it’s the plug finna drop off a dozen
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
I hopped in the cutlass
I hopped out a bucket
I pop like I pulled out my weight in some luggage
These hoes steady buggin'
My phone steady buzzin'
I think it’s the plug finna drop off a dozen
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Right off the back all these niggas be frontin'
Now I got money, they can’t tell me nothin'
Get that gut feeling, you know that they comin'
You ain't got no paper, ain't even worth runnin'
Hopped out the cutlass and hopped in the bucket
Running your mouth, you’ll get popped in your nugget
You had the ball and you dropped it then fuck it
I open up shop on the block and I crush it
Don’t let yourself be the next Kiss opponent
No, I ain't driving but yeah, bitch, I own it
Usually niggas get caught in the moment
I showed them a style and they just went and cloned it
Whole ones, half ones, even zips movin'
We ain't gon' even talk 'bout the bricks movin'
Rock a gold sky dweller and a thick Cuban
Gave away more hits than Rick Rubin
Hard times come, you just gotta get through 'em
These lil niggas got a lotta shit brewin'
Feds get involved then a lotta shit ruined
Used to spit at niggas, now I spit through 'em
I don’t wash clothes, nigga, I just get new ones
Real boss niggas, it be hard to get to 'em
Yeah, real low on these suckers
I walked out the trap house and hopped in the cutlass

[Hook: Ex.od.us]
I hopped in the cutlass
I hopped out a bucket
I pop like I pulled out my weight in some luggage
These hoes steady buggin'
My phone steady buzzin'
I think it’s the plug finna drop off a dozen
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
I hopped in the cutlass
I hopped out a bucket
I pop like I pulled out my weight in some luggage
These hoes steady buggin'
My phone steady buzzin'
I think it’s the plug finna drop off a dozen
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing

[Verse 2: Ex.od.us]
Where I’m from, ain't nothing but survival
Before nigga pray, they gon' pick up that rifle
Before niggas sleep, they gon' camp out and snipe you
Wipe you off face of the earth, your face on a shirt
I've been through, that phantom fly back to that place where I'm from
But not happy when they took my brother, the government kidnap
But shit, I ain't just talking, I ain't just rappin', said it really happened
That’s why I get on shit you with and I vomit
I don’t give a fuck, you know how extra comin'
It's beef, I'm at you and I might at ya woman
I make it look like you put time in for nothin'
Don't make no sudden movements 'round me, I’m clutchin'
These niggas had to see the money I’m touchin'
My niggas put their hands on cars and I'm pushin'
But I ain't jumping foreign, nigga
