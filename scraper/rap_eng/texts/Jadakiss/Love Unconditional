Unconditional

[Verse 1: Heather Victoria]
You love so freely, you love so deeply
So completely (there’s nothing I can do)
To make me love you any more tan you’ve already show
I have always known (there’s nothing I can do)
Or be, or say, and thanks to you
For all the love you give (there’s nothing I can do)
Nothing but to tell you how I’m feeling
When I’m feeling (there’s nothing I can do)

[Hook: Heather Victoria]
Nothing like love unconditional
Unconditional

[Verse 2: Heather Victoria]
Boy I want you to know you can depend on me
Always depends on me (for everything you need)
Believe in me as long as I can breathe
I will never let you down (for everything you need)
You mean so much to me always so close to me
How could I not be (for everything you need)
I’d swim in oceans, just give me a notion
Or give me emotion (for everything you need)

[Hook]

[Bridge: Heather Victoria]
I’ll be, I’ll be, everything everything
I’ll be everything you need, baby yes

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
It ain’t another girl in the world like my dear shorty
No matter how much I wild out she right there for me
Trill honey, probly’ll kill for me
In sickness or health or in court with the bail money
A good thing’ll fade away when you prolong
When there’s me in her eyes I can do no wrong
Her friends be hating like “girl, how could you hold on?”
But it’s too late, the bond done grew so strong
Three-quarter or full length, it gotta be fur
And if I was to ever get married it gotta be her
When you do it you can’t half-ass it you gotta be sure
For it to work, can’t be fake, you gotta be pure
No reason for you to ever hafta lie to me for
Till they put my body in the earth I gotta be yours
The one that you talk to, the one that you listen to
Forever and always, love unconditional
Muah

[Hook]
