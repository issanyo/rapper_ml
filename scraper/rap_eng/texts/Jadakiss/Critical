[Intro: Jeezy]
Yeah, critical
Yeah, critical
Yeah, critical
Yeah, critical

[Chorus: Jeezy]
Streets critical
[?]
Bought me two bricks call me 60 thou'
Pay for the coke nigga its a trial
Paid for the case nigga beat the trial
Bought a Rolex nigga and a dial
Gave a bad bitch
Came with young niggas yeah and they wild
Them pearly whites
All my niggas gettin' head tonight
All my niggas gettin' bread tonight
Sittin' back make sure the bread is right
Two-door cost 250 thou'
Ain't no scales its digital
Cookin' them figures like Mr. Chow
Yeah I know the streets like critical

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
I'm still rapping
I'm still trapping
Know 'em all my life
But I still clap 'em
Yeah I know I don't own a team
But so what bitch I'm still a captain
Guns up, my money stacked
My work guaranteed, money back
I sold dope and I slung crack
Twelve twelve, them hundred sacks
I'm done with that
I had fun with that
Y'all go ahead, y'all run with that
Only thing about the game of life is
When you lose you can't run it back
Block-boomin, spot-boomin
Start asking, stop assuming
Better than me there's not a human
Take the plates off, cop a new one
Two door cost me a quarter mil'
Make sure you knock off all the pills
Spent a little extra, caught the deal
44 Bulldog off your grill
First they get your name, then they get your files
Then they sit you down
Street life is critical

[Chorus: Jeezy]
Streets critical

Bought me two bricks call me 60 thou'

All my niggas gettin' head tonight
All my niggas gettin' bread tonight
Sittin' back make sure the bread is right
Two-door cost 250 thou'
Ain't no scales its digital

Yeah I know the streets like critical

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
On my 87, my blunt lit
Got a 40 cal. for the dumb shit
Call it stupid head, now its stupid head
All I know is she a dumb bitch
My mind gone, my mind blown
All the shit that my mind on
Streets are waitin' for, niggas hatin', I'm still gettin' my shine on
My cup full, my pocket full, my tank never on 'E' bitch
All them 2's I be talkin' 'bout, damn right they don't need bitch
Summer time, four 9's, cuttin' shit like a dealer hoe
Every day is my birthday, its like every month september hoe
Got this rollie on, nigga hold on
Back back you don't know me holmes
Pyrex, digital scale, and the glass stove I'll show you holmes
All about my money hoe, my money fast your money slow
Sitting back my money grow
Best believe me and my money know that

[Chorus: Jeezy]
