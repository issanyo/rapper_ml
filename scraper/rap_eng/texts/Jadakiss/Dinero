[Intro: Jadakiss + Beanie Sigel]
Welcome back Beans, this history baby
Broadstreet bully set free
Compound, compound
Top 5 dead or alive, raspy
And it's a shame what they'll do for that legal tender

[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
Money is the root of all evil is what they teach you
That's what made Nino rock his brother's keeper
That's what made Alpo slaughter Rich Porter
When you got a big supporter and your mafia tight
Money, power, respect, comin' at order
Dollars ain't shit without the knowledge
Mike got robbed, I robbed him
Hammer got hammered, too much stylin'
Too many cars in the garages
Too much flauntin', 100 man entouragin'
If money make your world go around, you got a problem
But let's make no mistake, let's get it straight
I've done seen paper take mothers off section 8
They say the early bird get the worm
So I left home to earn
And left no stone unturned
As a young buck I hit the bricks, took the street route
Y'all dudes are still in the nest with your beak out
Whoever learned you dudes is incorrect
Cause I don't trust no chick, mom no disrespect
And you done wiped my ass and I done fed off your breasts
If you dealin' them cards boo I'm cuttin' the deck

[Interlude]
So you think money is the root of all evil? Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Those pieces of paper which should have been gold should are a token of honor
(Jadakiss: That's why they love you when you don't got it
Then soon as you get it they hate you)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Haha!
All four pockets, bankrolls that can't be tucked
It's strange I done seen money break families up
For 500 cash even seen your man get cut
Postin' pictures on the 'Gram all bandaged up
If you do get it, don't take it for granted bruh
The counters are all marble and granite bruh
If it's done right you can get a flower from a seed
And the root of money is power for more greed
Sad part about it, it's somethin' we all need
I know ex-kingpins that's working at Wal-Greens
Know a team of young swipers, shake up the mall scene
Anything to get the money, they need it like morphine
They give you lump sums then they tax you for it
People ask you for it or they'll clap you for it
Soon as you build it, they destroy it
Then when you need it you can't get it
You get it? You can't enjoy it

[Interlude 2]
Money is a tool of exchange which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears. Or of the looters who take it from you by force. (Money)
