[2x Jadakiss]
Niggas talk shit about us - but it's ok!
Game ain't shit without us - but it's ok!
No, you can't live without us - it's ok!
But go ahead, you can doubt us - it's ok!

[Jadakiss & Styles P]
Checks get cut after the clearance
But what we dealing with is hard work and perseverance
Still send a nice ransom note to your parents
I'ma wrap this bitch till it needs some ball bearings
Trying to renovate the west wing of the mansion
I ain't thinking recession, I'm thinking expansion...
I be in the malls
But my chain is dancing
More than 200 on the dash?
I'ma tear it
But you ain't gotta be nice
Pass off for parents
44 mag is the last thing you hearing
If the work don't make it, that's a pass interference
Shots of tequila, spending car money at the jeweler
Spending house money at the dealer
Rubber bag of piff
Sour need a sealer
Wanna see a real nigga?
I just look into the mirror

[2x Chorus:]
Niggas talk shit about us - but it's ok!
Game ain't shit without us - but it's ok!
No, you can't live without us - it's ok!
But go ahead, you can doubt us - it's ok!

[Verse 2]
We about dough
Never without dough, moving work out of state
In and out flow
Real lyrical
Ralph lauren table, ralph lauren couch, yo
Ralph lauren everything that fit up in the house though
Whaddup to them polo boys who know tony
Couldn't have been manolo's boy
Cartier frames
Clear lens tho!
8 series beemer, 7-series benzo
Mobster: I probably go to hell if my friends go
Never shoot in a blind fury
Diamonds like sprite!
It's lemon and lime jewelry

[2x Chorus:]

[Verse 3]
Rap with the connect - it's ok!
Hope you force somebody to test it - it's ok!
Lookout on the lookout - it's ok!
We gonna have the fiends singing like michele
Bang hard like the niggas out in east la
Know we from the bay in the pink all day
Still dope money in the grey mink all day
Just do it right, don't sit around and think all day

[2x Chorus:]
