[Verse One: Millyz]
Okay
My cup over-runneth
Got a bundle of dope
On my pack is the hundreds
Hoodie under the coat
Got a plug on the purple
Couple hundred of rope
Ain't no squares in my circle
Mother-fuck being broke
I got dope
And you know that
Move a pound of bunk and some bumps
Thats a throwback
Hall of fame picture Sandy Koufax
I'm in the game hoe, oh, fo sho that
Okay now lets get back to what matter
I was told to get the cake
You whip the cake, cake batter
And every chick I hit it's like her ass get fatter
And her eyes get wider when she find out I'm a rapper
But its money over bitches to the dizzy
That means to death
I got that molly by the krizzy
Percocet get you 200 for the 50
That's five racks if you want it fuck with me

Got the plug on it
Man, the kitchen table got some drugs on it, yeah
Then break it down and put some bud on it, yeah
Then got the soda, put the mud on it, put the mud on it

Uncut heroin
They tellin' in my town so I took it down to Maryland
West-Side Baltimore
Listen while I talk to ya'll
If that money short I put these bullets on his [?]
Sixty for the whole thing
Thirty for the half
You ain't have to finish school, nigga
You can do the math
Got the twelve hour shifts
Going hard with the goons
At the table getting busy with the cards and the spoons
Got the fiends in a line
Them things in the nine
Try to run off with the pack get them things in your spine
Ain't nobody see me clap
Ain't no body droppin' dimes
If they ain't poppin' pills then they prolly snortin' lines
We just giving to the needy
We ain't being greedy
Recently you overdosed hope your recovery is speedy
Yeah, I'm coming at you like a movie thats in 3-D
If I ain't got nothing else, I got D.O.P.E nigga
