[Chorus: Styles P]
This is my party, I’m 'bout to do the most here
This is my party, I’m actin’ like the hoes here
This is my party, I got all my folks here
This is my party
This Is my party
This is my party
This is my party, I’m 'bout to do the most here
This is my party, I bought all the smoke here
This is my party, I’m 'bout to make a toast here
This is my party
This is my party
This is my party

[Verse 1: Styles P]
THC levels off the Rictor, God give strange shoulda rolled it in a scripture
Liquor and a Barq, that's a hell of a mixure
Thought it was the main bitch, oops, it’s her sister
She was just layin' there, I picked her up to twist her
Somebody said, "Put my weed down, mister"
This is my party, I can do the most here
Who the fuck invited you? Shit, I’m the host here
Excuse my French but I think they playin' french
I think I smell sour, that’s a hell of a stench
This is my party, fly clothes and feet wet
Dancin’ like Pam from Total and you should be here

[Chorus: Styles P]
This is my party, I’m 'bout to do the most here
This is my party, I’m actin’ like the hoes here
This is my party, I got all my folks here
This is my party
This Is my party
This is my party
This is my party, I’m 'bout to do the most here
This is my party, I bought all the smoke here
This is my party, I’m 'bout to make a toast here
This is my party
This is my party
This is my party

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Thank y’all for comin’ out
It’s all on me so the drinks ain’t runnin’ out
Spot's Jam packed but it’s just right
It looks like tonight's gonna be one of them haze and kush nights
Yeah, I'm doin Yak shots, avoidin' the snapshots
I ain't tryin to take flicks, I'm lookin' for back shots
P-O-L-O down, bucks on with the ascot
All from the sponsors, imagine what the cash got
You ain’t promised tomorrow, this could be your last stop
Hit the dance floor, get on somethin' wit' ass shots
And I ain’t tryin’ to front, nigga, but I can do whatever I want, nigga
'Cause...

[Chorus: Styles P]
This is my party, I’m 'bout to do the most here
This is my party, I’m actin’ like the hoes here
This is my party, I got all my folks here
This is my party
This Is my party
This is my party
This is my party, I’m 'bout to do the most here
This is my party, I bought all the smoke here
This is my party, I’m 'bout to make a toast here
This is my party
This is my party
This is my party

[Verse 3: Styles P]
So fresh and so clean like I’m OutKast
No Promethazine just the wax and the scout pack
And I got the dab rigs, never did it average
I speak and these bitches repeat like its an ad-lib
Drink, smoke, then I repeat, I got the hash [?]
Call my man up on the phone, we got it madly, we listenin’
Some freak pulled her asshole out, [?] kissin' it
Girls scouts up in the air, some niggas piffin' it
Then I put the phone to the crowd, told 'em listen in
Then I pulled the phone back down, told to vision it
Say he’d be there in a minute, could I get him in?
This is my party, my nigga, I get you Sprinted here

[Chorus: Styles P]
This is my party, I’m 'bout to do the most here
This is my party, I’m actin’ like the hoes here
This is my party, I got all my folks here
This is my party
This Is my party
This is my party
This is my party, I’m 'bout to do the most here
This is my party, I bought all the smoke here
This is my party, I’m 'bout to make a toast here
This is my party
This is my party
This is my party
