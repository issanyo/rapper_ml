Right by my side
B. Hudson, Jadakiss, Ne-Yo
I think it's me and you tonight ma, let's go
They say every good woman needs a thug
They say every good woman needs a thug
Go baby, you so wavy
And I ain't never felt this way 'bout no lady
Considering going half with you on your baby
Something about you, making me go crazy
Know if I ain't soured up, I'm so hazy
Me and you on the same page, so amazing
Need your love girl, so many ways
And we could only hold out for so many days
And got enough points to score but you shaving
Hell yeah, I'm anxious, but you craving
Time keep flying, I'ma keep trying
And bottom line, I need your L-O-V-I-N
Come on!
Girl, make no mistake, right by my side
Little mama that's your place, keep holding me down
And you can help me spend this cake, right by my side
Ride with me, all I need is you right by my side
Such a small fella to recognize the Mason Martin Margielas
What could I tell her?
Man, I swear you gotta see her to believe her
Then maybe you could understand why I need her
Besides her being a diva she wasn't bothered by the chiba
Zodiac sign was a Libra, definitely a keeper
I just wanna put her in the sleeper, then fall out underneath her
Wake up, take a shower, then get deeper
Juice up, get some power and then freak her
After the feedback, then I could G Mack
But it's something about her love making me need that
Come on!
Girl, make no mistake, right by my side
Little mama that's your place, keep holding me down
And you can help me spend this cake, right by my side
Ride with me, all I need is you right by my side
When the drama comes my way
Long as I got you, girl it's nothing
Baby, it's nothing, I'm good
When these streets, girl, come what may
Shorty, we do what we do, so it's nothing
Baby girl, your love is something I need
Yo, they say every good woman needs a thug
I totally agree, that's why I need your love
And I can't help it if I'm selfish
'Cause I need your love and nobody else's
I'm starting to taste it, pardon the bracelet
The chance of a lifetime and I can't waste it
If being beautiful was a test, she'd have aced it
Her skin is flawless, her hair is waist length
Hi I'm Jason and ma I'm patiently
Waiting for us to have relations
Kissing me is just history in the making
Squeezing and hugging, I need your loving
Come on!
Girl, make no mistake, right by my side
Little mama that's your place, keep holding me down
And you can help me spend this cake, right by my side
Ride with me, all I need is you right by my side
