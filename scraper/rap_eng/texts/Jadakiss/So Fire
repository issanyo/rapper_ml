You're so fine
You're so fire
Can I get to you

You're so fine
You're so fine girl
Can I get to you
(yeah-yeah) x2

[Verse 1: Ky'Lee]
Most of these niggas holla to enter you
But what I want to show you is different
I'm intervening something like an interlude
I'm sure its been a few
Since a nigga focused on your mental rather then your physical
Let's get deeper your spiritual (uhh)
I don't know if it's them jeans or it's the spit you're talking
5'5 slim waist little pretty chocolate
You a rider the Feds is on us, you hold the bag
Stash the pieces little thugging mommy my shorty bad

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Tell your girlfriends it goes there
Conversations could lead to Lord knows where
Red carpets - nice poses
Jewelry boxes, dozens of white roses
(Uh-Yeah)
We just living though
Tear the mall up.. thats a given though
I know you knew a lot, how bout what you didn't know
Bentley Jeep wit' the Ribbon though
Ain't none flyer none higher gun fire
On sight when it come's to my number one rider
And I'm a King you know Sai's close by ya'
It's only right cause she so fine- so fire

[Hook]
