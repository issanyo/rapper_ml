[Bilal]
La, la-la-li-la, la-la-li-la, la-la-li-la
Yeah, oo-ooh, oh, oh

Hey, livin it, in the, fast lane
Drivin, fast broads, with the fast chains
Ah, when you pimpin through life (life!)
Seen some people get caught up
And some charges brought up
Wit some people they shot up
Hey, liiviiin theee, fast lane
Drivin, fast broads, makin, fast change
When you pimpin through life (ooh)
Seen some people get caught up
And some charges brought up
Wit some people they shot up
Hey, there it goes again
Different face, to the same old tragic end
Who's to, blame, if you never saw it comin
Yet they heard the boomer humin
And he never thought of runnin
It's too late, for him now, layin out, on the ground
So cold, soooo cold; nothin much, to live up
Too damn, it's so far gone (yeaah), sooo gooone
Livin, in the, fast lane
Drivin, fast broads, with your fast change
When you pimpin through the life (life!)
Seen some people got caught up
And some charges brought up
From some people they shot up
Hey, tell me when will it end?
Wit a baby, paays towards mother city
(oohh!) Trapped inside, the four walls
Of a penty way too strong, waay too strong!
(oh) Now she's out, in the cold
Dyin slow and the spoon still warm, whoa, heeeey!

[Jadakiss]
Aiyyo, I'm real wit my self and I'm true to my niggas
My only fear is what I might do to a nigga
The fast lane gotcha man speedin
It make me wanna load the thing-things up, and get even
D block layin 'em down
In the box hands crossed, same smirk he had playin around
Still go to war wit the same eight and a pound
This the remix nigga, 'Kiss, Dre and Bilal {*echoe*}

[Dr. Dre]
Too often, is a young nigga, in a coffin
Tryin blossom, got shot down walkin, heh
Bleek a high to hot guy, turned cold
Bring the body bag, see the bullet hole and a burned soul
Don't cry, he chose the life
Fast lane, in the brain, he supposed to fight
How you smile at a momma when she lost a child?
This is realness, tell 'em how they livin, where you at Bilal?

[Bilal]
No, no, noo
The way we livin, in the, fast lane
Drivin, fast broads, wit yo', oh, fast change
When you pimpin through the life, oooh yeah!
Caught up, and some charges, brought up
From some people you shot up, hey
