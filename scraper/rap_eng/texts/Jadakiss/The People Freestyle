Jadakiss [Talking]
Diabolical word play
It's only the mixtape ladies and gentleman
Sour and chambers, my nigga, save your applauses
(Green Lantern drop that shit)
[Verse]:
This is for the black ra-dio, niggas that play C-lo
Always on the d-low, with dreams of a kilo
It's nice if Jordan hit the jumper on Craig Ehlo
Show a stranger love hate on a brother we know
A lot of niggas got killed because of their ego
Either over a bitch or a couple of c-notes
It's rough in the g-h-e-t-t-o
Got to learn how to hear no evil and see no
I spit nothing but acid like amino
Still good for your skin though like aveeno
Honeys be amazed how my Hershey kiss ring glow
Miss being with my grandmother playing bingo
Whole album is crack not just the singles
Its garbage if u put it on your tongue and it don't tingle
I still be in the hood nigga I let the thing go
Bullets gone burn but the razor gone sting though
Do this for niggas in Coxsackie in a swing yo
Got a team out in Louisville like Patino
Kill you in 88 minutes like Pacino
Connects show me how to play dominos and pokeno
21 nigga I'm robbing all the casinos
Name ring bells from Rikers Island to Chino
Little niggas with choppers hopping out the Camino
Who ever didn't get hit evacuated the scene yo
You know that I don't fuck around let your team know
Or one day when you’re out of town I'll let your queen know
I mean what I say, and I say what I mean yo
Send you to the hospital first then your spleen yo
And I ain't trying get funny money I need mean dough
Niggas can't fuck with the God come clean yo
I shit on niggas dreams yo, kiss my ass

Styles P Verse:
This is for the black iPid-od, niggas who still kid-ar
Those up north in the yard on the bid-ar
Whoever throw a 50 of weed in they cigar
Couldn’t except when the Jets got Brett Fid-ar
True New Yorker need money like A-Rid-ar
Get out of ya place and your face a get skid-ar
Use to blow weed with Big out of the jid-ar
Ya man could get pluck like a string on the guitar
You could be this year’s bird and get killed-off
If I'm on the road it's me busy and hit hard
Real ironic that I get busy and hit hard
Hop in the big ass van and drive fiz-ar
Real hood nigga so never call me a stiz-ar
More like the sun and the moon ask the giz-ard
Can't understand tight jeans big skid-ars
Niggas look half way gay mad bizarre
Buck shot daily I'm up in the juice bizz-ar
Nice on the mic like Cool G, Kane, and Izzard
4-4 bulldog I’m knocking a nigga rib off
12 gauge shotgun tearing a nigga lid off
Kidnap a girlfriend dropping a nigga kid off
Connect with the bricks they droppin a nigga shit off
Drop top then get it popping when it skid off
Louch, Kiss, and me is the best who wanna spit off
