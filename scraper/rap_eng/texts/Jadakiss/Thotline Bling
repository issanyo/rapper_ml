[Intro]
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Nino Man

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my trap phone
Just so we could keep shit low
Call me on my trap phone
Just so we could shit low
Y'all know when that thotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Y'all know when that thotline bling
I'm hitting everything

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city you
Got the nerve to call yourself grown
You get around so now you’re well known
Time to hold hold you down I tell you hell now
Ever since I left the city you
Single parent home but your mom works
Fucking for some stretchies and some Converse
Can’t even hide the fact that you’re beyond thirst

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my trap phone
Just so we could keep shit low
Call me on my trap phone
Just so we could shit low
Y'all know when that thotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Y'all know when that thotline bling
I'm hitting everything

[Verse 2]
I’ve seen your friends and I said I want you, you, you
Yeah, you call this shit my petty song
She was a thot but was a pretty jawn
Bitch gonna be so mad when I’m really on
Cause when I get them M’s I’m curving you
You see me calling you so don’t lie
I can’t believe you hit me with your phone die
When I start curving back, baby, don’t cry

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my trap phone
Just so we could keep shit low
Call me on my trap phone
Just so we could shit low
Y'all know when that thotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Y'all know when that thotline bling
I'm hitting everything

[Verse 3]
I know you’re just trying to live life
But don’t go trying to leave forgettin’
It’s me that’s livin’
The lights and the Gram got you ego trippin’
Don’t forget I’m the nigga don’t deceive your vision
I made you give me head until your knees is rippin’
Now you acting all brand new though
That last nigga you ran off like kudos
Talking bullshit, I laugh like you slow
I know you lying and the whole damn zoo know
And no I’m not mad at all
I’m just putting you in your place
So I’mma go carry on
Cause you thotting, I’mma crew and a taste
But you was on the dick
You was walking by, I was on the strip
Now it’s time to curve like you don’t exist
But don’t forget...

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my trap phone
Just so we could keep shit low
Call me on my trap phone
Just so we could shit low
Y'all know when that thotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Y'all know when that thotline bling
I'm hitting everything
