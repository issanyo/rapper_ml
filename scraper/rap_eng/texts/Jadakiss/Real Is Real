[Intro: Diddy]
Anytime any of you punk ass niggas wanna say I took something from you
I never take nothing from you
I work too hard for mine, baby
I go hard in this paint right here
You know what, I love this
I'ma give it you before I take it from you, bitch

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yeah, told my nigga real is real and bitch is bitch
If I ain't doing a deal I'm probably with ya bitch
You ain't gotta second guess you know I'm with the shits
I don't care about ya rep, you know I get ya heaaadd
Yeah, rich is rich and broke is broke
You already know my niggas movin' coke and dope
Got the sour, got the haze, we got both to smoke
Plus we fuck the baddest bitches, that's from coast to coast
Get ya self robbed, stabbed, or pistol whipped (mmh)
Wherever we at you know we gets it lit
Shoot you in that same mouth that you dissed me with
But all that fuck shit, you could miss me with

[Chorus: Von]
Uh, listen nigga real is real and bitch is bitch
Nigga broke is broke and rich is rich
So all that in between you could miss me with (miss me with)
Yeah all that fuck shit you could miss me with (miss me with)
Told my nigga rich is rich and broke is broke (shit)
Whip it with ya wrist my nigga, dope is dope (skrrt skrrt)
So all that in between you could miss me with (D-Block)
And all that fuck shit you miss me with

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
You could miss me wit' it
Suckin' my dick all night then she go home and kiss you with it
What you jealous for?
Cause I'm on tour, and I ain't standing in front of no store?
With a beer in my hand, one blunt rolled
Three grams, talking about I'm movin' raw
Where the lawyer at? Where that bail money?
Where them hundred racks when it's real money
Rich is rich, broke is broke
Sour, haze, smoke is smoke
I'm getting money when I ain't awoke
When them guns is out it ain't a joke
Bottles pop, them trippy stix
Got her wallin' out on them I-G pics
Take her home for a couple of bucks
2 Chain voice, 'suck all the dicks'
Nigga we don't care about you
When it go down, we don't care what we shoot (nah)
Long as that money's there in that duffel bag
B-I-G, nigga, gimme the loot
I done learned from Puff, I done learned from Hov
Baking soda, I done learned the stove
Did the coupe, did the Rove
Got millions, nigga, if I'm getting old, hahh

[Chorus: Von]
Uh, listen nigga real is real and bitch is bitch
Nigga broke is broke and rich is rich
So all that in between you could miss me with (miss me with)
Yeah all that fuck shit you could miss me with (miss me with)
Told my nigga rich is rich and broke is broke (shit)
Whip it with ya wrist my nigga, dope is dope (skrrt skrrt)
So all that in between you could miss me with (miss me with)
And all that fuck shit you miss me with

[Verse 3: Styles P]
They told you money talk, what it sayin' to you? (what is it sayin'?)
A hunnid shots fired they ain't playing wit'chu
All that in between, you could miss me
When I'm in the limousine, French cuisine, with some prissy bitch
No promethazine, just some wax and my trippy stix
Go ahead and flip, if I don't get you killed, I get you pistol whipped
Louchy, Kiss and I
And some niggas that act ludicrous
Send yo ass to Lucifer, show you what elusive is
I don't give a fuck, I sit my dick on Medusa's lips
I ain't got a gun I get you hawked with a crucifix
This is Ghost, this D-Block, this is L-O-X
This is *gun sounds* 'til your head a mess

[Verse 4: Von]
Movin' with the tooly, they done got me on my drilling shit
All we movin' militant
Jada gone and kiss the shit
If involving currency, I get it done I'm diligent
Known for causin' homicides when I get the pinnin' shit
Real is real and bitch is bitch
Poor is poor and rich is rich
Claim you not a bitch well why the fuck you in ya feelings bitch
I could send a hunnid clues they still may never get the jit
Smell me, nigga, get a whiff
Pooper scooper up in the shit
Gone

[Chorus: Von]
Uh, listen nigga real is real and bitch is bitch
Nigga broke is broke and rich is rich
So all that in between you could miss me with (miss me with)
Yeah all that fuck shit you could miss me with (miss me with)
Told my nigga rich is rich and broke is broke (shit)
Whip it with ya wrist my nigga, dope is dope (skrrt skrrt)
So all that in between you could miss me with (miss me with)
And all that fuck shit you miss me with
