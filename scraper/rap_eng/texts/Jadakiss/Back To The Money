[Chorus: Millyz]
Nobody got no love for me like my hitters
Nobody got no love for me like my gang
And bitches wouldn't fuck with me, I remember
But now they wanna fuck with me 'cause times change (Times change, ayy)
So, its right back to the money (To the money)
Yeah, it's right back to the money (To the money)
It's right back to the money (To the money)
Yeah, it's right back the money (To the money)
So, it's right back to money (To the money)
Yeah, it's right back to the money (To the money)
It's right back to the money (To the money)
(Hey dolla I told you)
Yeah, it's right back to the money

[Verse 1: Millyz]
Yeah, big dope get bust down
Seven P's on the touchdown
Bag up and we flood town
Lame guys never come 'round
Thank god I'm above ground
So high never come down
Underworld and glorious
Bad bitch and the story
Pop deuce got a line on it
Perk 30's out Florida
They the ones that get bored with her
Dead the bitch like coroner
Loosey out that corner store
Ride around like we carnivores
Hated on me, they still do
'Lotta hustle it was no luck
You don't feel that, then I don't feel you, yeah
The team in whips when we peel through
Big dreams from a little dude
Y'all are smellin' mildew
Sped

[Chorus: Millyz]
Nobody got no love for me like my hitters
Nobody got no love for me like my gang
And bitches wouldn't fuck with me, I remember
But now they wanna fuck with me 'cause times change (Times change, ayy)
So, its right back to the money (To the money)
Yeah, it's right back to the money (To the money)
It's right back to the money (To the money)
Yeah, it's right back the money (To the money)
So, it's right back to money (To the money)
Yeah, it's right back to the money (To the money)
It's right back to the money (To the money)
Yeah, it's right back to the money

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Nobody got no love for me but my hitters
Y'all ain't got no love for me 'cause y'all bitter
This drinkin's catching up to me and my liver
But if you had it rough as me, you'd cry rivers
All I ever knew was flip the work and read quickly
Money made my situation do a three-sixty
'Cause five-hundred thou' y'all just bring me two-fifty
You can't trust niggas and they fingers too sticky
That's why it's just me and my gang
People stay the same even though the times change
If you ain't never met me, you don't know my mind frame
I ain't actin' funny, I'm back to the money

[Chorus: Millyz]
Nobody got no love for me like my hitters
Nobody got no love for me like my gang
And bitches wouldn't fuck with me, I remember
But now they wanna fuck with me 'cause times change (Times change, ayy)
So, its right back to the money (To the money)
Yeah, it's right back to the money (To the money)
It's right back to the money (To the money)
Yeah, it's right back the money (To the money)
So, it's right back to money (To the money)
Yeah, it's right back to the money (To the money)
It's right back to the money (To the money)
Yeah, it's right back to the money
