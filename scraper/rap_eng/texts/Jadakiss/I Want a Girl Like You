(Jadakiss)
The game is dirty
Watch how you playin it
It's your bed
Watch who you let lay in it
It's your crib
Watch who you let stay in it
Cuz when you think they won't
They just might
And it's hard to tell so choose your chicks right
The real one's know when you front
That's why you gotta know what you want
Walk with 'em... show 'em to lunch...
Conversate... 'talk to 'em slow... talk to 'em Joe...

(Joe)
Now a-day's it's hard to tell
Where them girls is comin from
Are they in it to the finish?
Or just havin fun?
I ain't mad at them girls
Doin what they do
Out to get that money
But I ain't that dude... whoaaa...

I want a girl
A regular girl
I want a girl
Only trippin off that iced out
I want a girl
A regular girl
If you for real
Well lemme hear ya holla

(Chorus)
I want a girl that can ride with me
Never get tired of me
That's the girl for me
I want a girl that can hang with me
Wanna do thangs with me
All I want...
I want a girl like you...

Uh-huh... wha... yo... let's go...

You better watch how you play
Careful who you choose
Might find yourself in tomorrow's news
Cuz some chicks can be scandalous
You gotta know which ones to trust
You're the kind of girl I would love to have
Just a little thug with a lotta class
Girl, you ain't got no drama...
You must get it from your mama...

I want a girl
A regular girl
I want a girl
Only trippin off that iced out
I want a girl
A regular girl
If you for real
Well lemme hear ya holla

(Chorus)
I want a girl that can ride with me
Never get tired of me
That's the girl for me
I want a girl that can hang with me
Wanna do thangs with me
All I want...
I want a girl like you...

I want a girl that look good, cook good
Don't listen to rap, but she still know when a hook's good
All she do is read so she know when a book's good
Love her cuz she's from the suburb and she looks hood
A lady but in bed she an animal still
Stick shift, or automatic, she can handle the wheel
Ugh... There when I call, there when I fall...
I want a girl just like you... and that's all

(Chorus x3)
I want a girl like you...
