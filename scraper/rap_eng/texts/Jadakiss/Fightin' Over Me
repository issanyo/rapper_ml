[Chorus: Paris Hilton]
Every time I turn around, the boys fightin' over me
Every time I step out the house, they wanna fight over me
Maybe 'cause I'm hot to death, and I'm so, so, so sexy
All the boys, all the silly boys, they wanna fight over me
Every time I turn around, the boys fightin' over me
Every time I step out the house, they wanna fight over me
Maybe 'cause I'm hot to death, and I'm so, so, so sexy
All the boys, all the silly boys, they wanna fight over me

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Up, and passin' the Hilton Suite, I'm still chasin' ya
Still patiently waitin' ma
Come lay off them Hampton guys and I'mma take ya to the x
Where them boys' lie
Play the corner all day, just plays cuz G's money
From deep all day, I'm straight swoosh
I'mma tie 'em at the Rucker, I'm at the Kanye ride
Doors up, doing donuts on the half court line
And any block we pass, niggas scream out crack
Yeah ma, you with the realest, how simple is that?
And you don't need him, you just need me
We can keep this on the low, we banned from TV
And he ain't gotta know, we ran through DC
Club Dreamin' ain't never be the same, we OD now
Dis is dis is your boy Joe Cook and this nigga all mad
Cause his chick got took

[Chorus: Paris Hilton]
Every time I turn around, the boys fightin' over me
Every time I step out the house, they wanna fight over me
Maybe 'cause I'm hot to death, and I'm so, so, so sexy
All the boys, all the silly boys, they wanna fight over me

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
We in the VIP, killin the ouncin'
Whoeva' ain't two steppin' is Willy bouncin'
Yeah, and you know the name of the game, so let go of ya dame
She chose me, ever since the DJ announced 'em
And she got the right to
Low button down, or WSL shades, the ice is bright too
And I'm around Gomes, might as well let me get her
I promise to send her back tomorrow, 'round noon
Sore loser but a good winner
Besides that she could use a little hood in her
A 40 from auto bond and a hood inner
You can bend her in the Range, back seat, at the center
Get violent, if money wanna try me
There's somethin' on the top of my flicky that spits silent
I don't feel haters and if you feeling some kinda way
E-mail him and tell him your still Jada's

[Chorus: Paris Hilton]
Every time I turn around, the boys fightin' over me
Every time I step out the house, they wanna fight over me
Maybe 'cause I'm hot to death, and I'm so, so, so sexy
All the boys, all the silly boys, they wanna fight over me

[Bridge: Paris Hilton]
Boys, boys, boys, boys, fightin' over me
If you wanna go abroad, you're gonna need a black dodd
And welcome to Paris
Boys, boys, boys, boys, fightin' over me
All them boys, all them silly boys, they wanna fight over me

[Chorus: Paris Hilton]
Every time I turn around, the boys fightin' over me
Every time I step out the house, they wanna fight over me
Maybe 'cause I'm hot to death, and I'm so, so, so sexy
All the boys, all the silly boys, they wanna fight over me
Every time I turn around, the boys fightin' over me
Every time I step out the house, they wanna fight over me
Maybe 'cause I'm hot to death, and I'm so, so, so sexy
All the boys, all the silly boys, they wanna fight over me
