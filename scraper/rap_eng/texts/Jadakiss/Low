Trying to chill, Trying to be low
Daytona

[Hook]
Already know what it is when I'm rolling up
Got the bottles on deck nigga hold 'em up
If the thirst is real tell a ho sip up
Trying to chill but still I ain't low nigga

[Verse 1: The Kid Daytona]
They like: "oh you act like you don't know niggas"
Just pass, no dap, no "hello nigga"
Go figure last winter I was close with you
I'm like: "homie is you serious you a ho nigga"
Yo I got no business with broke niggas
All my day one fam spending on sipping
Looking prolific, bitches blow kisses
I got the whole hood saying: "You ain't low nigga"
Oh shit Louis Vuitton loafers, my chick in them daffodils
I sit back and chill looking like the mack for real
As the waitress bring the bottles through
Little Mexican bring the cranberry- and orange juice
I'm no psychic, but I done read a mind or two
With you I read: "head [?]"
For all you square niggas 'out the loot:
"I hope next year work out for you"
I'm up in [?] with Nicole Kidman
And got all the hoes saying:

[Hook]
"You ain't low nigga, you ain't low nigga, you ain't low"

Already know what it is when I'm rolling up
Got the bottles on deck nigga hold 'em up
If the thirst is real tell a ho sip up
Trying to chill but still I ain't low nigga

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
The Bible tell: "You reap what you sow nigga"
And I be way too high to be low nigga
Yeah I'm in the hood getting doe nigga
And I ain't got to say what I sell you can go figure
I move mountains, but who's counting?
Top floor, ocean view, blue fountain
Ferragamos all suede a few thousands
The difference is I'm copping you browsing
My connect got a mutual respect
But if you talk or you short
They'll shoot you in the neck
Always keep you eyes on the deuces in the deck
And they won't jam with the correct usage of the tec
Nah, I don't like to talk much, I like to show niggas
If you ain't never broke bread, I don't know niggas
Self made millionaire, I don't owe niggas
And on that note:

[Hook]
"You ain't low nigga, you ain't low nigga, you ain't low"

Already know what it is when I'm rolling up
Got the bottles on deck nigga hold 'em up
If the thirst is real tell a ho sip up
Trying to chill but still I ain't low nigga

[Verse 1: The Kid Daytona]
My act like De Niro in the Tangiers
Anyway, I'm the man there
I'm cool with all the fanfare
"What you doing just standing there
Bitch make it move for them niggas in them lavish wears"
No whack bitches in my atmosphere
No tracks in here
Just curly haired girls, I'm attracting yea
[?], [?], East Africans yea
Dimples in the lower back smiling at me
She just throw it back, cause my rap style is nasty
Got to [?] bitches
Can't trust a big butt and a smile:

[Hook]
"You ain't low nigga, you ain't low nigga, you ain't low"

Already know what it is when I'm rolling up
Got the bottles on deck nigga hold 'em up
If the thirst is real tell a ho sip up
Trying to chill but still I ain't low nigga
