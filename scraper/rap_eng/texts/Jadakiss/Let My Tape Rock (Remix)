[Verse One: Jadakiss]
Yo! DJ you could chill out yo
Let my joint rock all the way to the outro
Jail's is tuned in niggas is in the house yo
Dudes that usually play the yard ain't comin out yo
They waitin to exhale finally the monsters made it
Like the airwaves was so damn constipated
And that bullshit was all on your conscience ain't it
If you can't see the picture then it's hard to paint it
When the cub turns to a lion it's hard to tame it
Rappers thinkin they hard but they hardly famous
Yeah! Nice gear and a great watch
Fifteen years of straight notch, let my tape rock

[Verse Two: Red Cafe]
Yeah, I'm only here to satisfy the streets
I kill 'em all, my alibis is sweet
I hear them playin that's half them guys that weak
So what you niggas do? I sell couple pies a week
Let my tape rock, you know my tape hot
I mean #1 on that 8-to-8 slot
White hood, black hood, any state block
Nigga, let my tape rock 'til my fuckin tape pop (What else?)
That boy cold, they callin him lo-cold
They callin my old phone, currently my ho phone
High as fuck, I'm kissin the ozone
With my Mexican bitch, she nursin my homegrown
No one man should have all this powder
But I'm in, I have all this chowder
I need to hear my tape rock e'rry hour
If not, I'ma just continue movin flour

[Chorus: "Sample courtesy of "Juicy" by The Notorious B.I.G] (Mysonne)

[Verse Three: Mysonne] ("Sample courtesy of "Juicy" by The Notorious B.I.G)
Let my tape rock don't stop that
Dudes gettin gwop on the block 'gon knock that
It's not that, lollipop shit that drop and shake it
This is that project basement
This is that party full of dudes with scarred up faces
Head noddin with the hardest basses
Drinkin Bacardi, broads with gorgeous faces
Shakin, in the corners wasted
This is that Rikers lock in hop in the whip
In the yard on the bar twenty five a clip
In the day room right in front of the TV
Tape deck knockin 'cause they can't get CD's
This is 3D right in your face music
Not PG, you might catch a case to it
Theme music, to go get bread
So go 'head and do like Big said (Let my tape rock)

[Chorus: "Sample courtesy of "Juicy" by The Notorious B.I.G] (N.O.R.E.)
Let my tape rock Let my Let my tape rock
Let-Let-Let my tape rock Let my Let my tape rock (UH!)
Let-Let-Let my tape rock Let my Let my tape rock (UH!)
Let-Let-Let my tape rock Let my Let my tape rock (UH! REMIX)
Let-Let-Let my tape rock Let my Let my tape rock (WHAT! WHAT WHAT!)
Let-Let-Let my tape rock Let my Let my tape rock  (WHAT WHAT! WHAT WHAT!)
Let-Let-Let my tape rock Let my Let my tape rock (WHAT WHAT! WHAT WHAT!)
Let-Let-Let my tape rock 'til my 'til my tape pop (WHAT WHAT! WHAT WHAT!)

[Verse Four: N.O.R.E.]
Aiyyo Mysonne, I gotchu!
Aiyyo let my tape rock, I let ya face pop
I spent two stacks on the bar on Ciroc
That Militainment regime, you get it 'cause you asked for it (Militainment!)
You'll catch us in Dubai, we passported
Kush already there, no need to transport it
Sour's my cologne, it's like my Axe body spray
Now I check my BDS like twice a day
Let my tape rock nigga, or it's fuck you
'Cause I can have Magic Johnson jumpoff dump you
And no I ain't Hov, but my verse is +Decoded+
Your wife is my jumpoff, she got demoted
I ran outta bullets then I went and reload it
{*BANG*}

[Outro: B.I.G. sample]
Let my tape rock, 'til my 'til my tape pop
