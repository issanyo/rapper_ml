[Intro Jadakiss - Styles P]
Yeah niggas
Ayo ?? I ain't gonna sit over here and lie and say I'm finished with the album
'Cause if anybody know I ain't finished with the album..you know I ain't finished
But niggas say "yo you gotta do a mixtape son!"
Niggas hitting me, texting me, emailing
I'm like "for what?"
Go in son!

[Verse Jadakiss]
Yo the game's getting old, shorty's going up top
Coming home, a little bigger with waves and paroles
Dope's in the hole, the fiends all lined up
Everybody tr√©s pound down and nine'd up
Money short? No telling where you could wind up
Gangs in new York, a lot of soft niggas signed up
Nothing like the feeling you get, when you bust the K
I can do back to back bullets, won't touch a tray
Me Gus and K, rude pimping
And a big shipment of something that taste different
Hollow tips turn grown men back into infants
Two trap houses, Greensboro and Winston
Some is behind a wall, other niggas is fenced in
Couple of em just touched down that just did ten
Cut ain't bad enough for staples you get stitched in
Lucky that the doctor was even able to fix him
Yeah...What the fuck did you tell me?
Red and green stripe on the capital LV
If I don't make it all that means is I failed me
So either I make a hit record or sell D
I'm tryna do both
Bars, top of the line, 'bout a nine or the dope
Balcony, looking at your mind through the scope
Devil telling me "do it"but the angels saying "no"
Made it out the jail, you lucky nobody cut you
You going to the hole, screaming and nobody touch you
Looking for the foul, and that's where the trouble 's at
Say death comes in threes, but I can double that
Any narcotic in the world, I can bubble that
Infatuated with the drug game, but in love with rap
Cocaine in my DNA... and my blood is E & J
Rather see em bleed then to see em paid
D-Block nigga we don't play!
