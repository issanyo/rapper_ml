[Intro: FatBoy SSE]
Yeah, yeah, FatBoy Gang
Yeah, yeah, Pat, turn me up
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: FatBoy SSE]
Ayy, I'm glued to that paper, I'ma count it
I'm glued to that paper, I'ma count it
I came from the trap, sellin' ounces
I came from the trap, sellin' ounces, hold up
Now I got a house in the mountain, huh
Cranberry all up in the fountain, huh
Cranberry all up in the fountain (Gang)
I came from the trap, sellin' ounces (Look, look, ayy)

[Verse 1: FatBoy SSE]
It feel like I done made it when I step out
Assed out, cuttin' niggas off was the best drought, yeah
Now I got a foreign with a glass house
Bad lil' mami in the room with a slick mouth, yeah
Fiji water filter on the shower
Honey Backwood for the dower
I get 10K for an hour
Hatin' on me, then you a coward
You mad 'cause your whole life's sour
Ayy, Ocean Spray right up in the faucet
Gettin' all this shmoney, swear I lost it
How you know I'm bossin'?
PJ with Lar$$en
We snatch a nigga's spot like this shit was some parkin', nigga

[Chorus: FatBoy SSE & Jadakiss]
Ayy, I'm glued to that paper, I'ma count it
I'm glued to that paper, I'ma count it
I came from the trap, sellin' ounces
I came from the trap, sellin' ounces, hold up
Now I got a house in the mountain, huh (Mountains, mountains)
Cranberry all up in the fountain, huh (Fountains, fountains)
Cranberry all up in the fountain (Fountains, fountains)
I came from the trap, sellin' ounces

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Now we walk right past the bouncers (Excuse me)
Everybody, it don't matter what the count is (Big man right there is the last one)
When we step in they announce us (D-Block)
Fifty bottles, we don't care what the amount is (Woo)
First pack was my man's work (Yeah)
Before ounce, hand-to-hand with the grams first (Three for five)
We was able to rise above that (Uh)
Could buy whatever we want now and we love that (We love it)
Funny thing was all of them was doubtin' (Doubtin')
Now I deal with lawyers and accountants (That's it)
Now all I know is keep countin' (I keep countin')
Came from the trap sellin' ounces (Uh)

[Chorus: FatBoy SSE]
Ayy, I'm glued to that paper, I'ma count it
I'm glued to that paper, I'ma count it
I came from the trap, sellin' ounces
I came from the trap, sellin' ounces, hold up
Now I got a house in the mountain, huh
Cranberry all up in the fountain, huh
Cranberry all up in the fountain
I came from the trap, sellin' ounces
