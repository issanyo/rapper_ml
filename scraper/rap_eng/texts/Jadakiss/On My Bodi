[Intro: Jadakiss]
There's a lot of angels
But there’s only one Deven Angel

[Bridge: Deven Angel]
Do I got the juice?
Do I got the sauce?
If the devil callin', I just dub it, I'mma boss
I don’t want no business in it
I promise I'm too independent

[Chorus: Deven Angel]
On my bodi, on my bodi
Slim thick mami and she shaped just like a Barbie
She callin' my phone and she callin' me her papi
Oh, she on my bodi, yeahhh
On my bodi, on my bodi
Slim thick mami and she shaped just like a Barbie
She callin' my phone and she callin' me her papi
Oh, she on my bodi, yeahhh

[Verse 1: Deven Angel]
If I had some tattoes on my face
Would you love me now or would you another day?
If my wrist was icy and I pulled in a Wraith
Would you love me now or would you another day?
Party Gettin' crazy, maybe, maybe, maybe
Me and Jada pullin' up so you know she goin’ crazy
But I don’t know what's in your drink, girl
If you sippin’ brown or Champagne, girl
Ohhh

[Chorus: Deven Angel]
On my bodi, on my bodi
Slim thick mami and she shaped just like a Barbie
She callin' my phone and she callin' me her papi
Oh, she on my bodi, yeahhh

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
On my bodi, on my bodi
I don't really know her, I just met her at a party
Yeah she look’ded good but her attitude was snotty
She run every mornin', after that, she do Pilates
Now she kick box and she used to do Karate
Money don't mean nothin' to her either 'cause she got it
All of that was out the window when I lit up some exotic
Ninteen-forty-two shots got her all erotic
Know I need the Carfax, gotta check the mileage
Flight about to leave, we just waitin' on the pilot
Okay, got the liquor and the lotti
Make sure we got enough 'cause she all over my bodi

[Verse 3: Deven Angel]
She on me, it's too much
And her company got me fed up
But I'mma lay back and face this backwood
And you gon' stay mad that I done dubbed you
Just play your part
If I had a fancy car from the start
Couple records on the charts
You'll want P.C. of my heart
I see you actin' naughty
I won't tell nobody
That's why you want on my bodi
Why you on my bodi

[Chorus: Deven Angel]
On my bodi, on my bodi
Slim thick mami and she shaped just like a Barbie
She callin' my phone and she callin' me her papi
Oh, she on my bodi, yeahhh
On my bodi, on my bodi
Slim thick mami and she shaped just like a Barbie
She callin' my phone and she callin' me her papi
Oh, she on my bodi, yeahhh

[Bridge: Deven Angel]
I'm never frontin' baby, never stunin' baby
Just a youngin' from the guttah, baby, word to mother, baby
Want some lovin' but I dubbed it baby, had to cut it, baby
Had to cut you off, had to cut you off

[Outro: Jadakiss & Deven Angel]
Uh huh, I'm try'na tell ya
This boy Deven Angel, the truth
Just play your part
If I had a fancy car from the start
Couple records on the charts
You'll want P.C. of my heart
