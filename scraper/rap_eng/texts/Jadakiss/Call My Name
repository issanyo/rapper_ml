[Intro: Benzino]
Un hun, un hun-un
Un hun, un hun-un
Un hun, un hun-un

[Jadakiss]
Yo, yeah, aiyyo
We can do whatever you want to, I promise
Fight, play razor tag or spit lamas
I'm two guns up over the roof
Hopin at least one hit your upper gums over your tooth
Cuz a lot of niggas jus talkin
Wanna kill a nigga on a record, when they see 'em they jus talkin
In my case, I'ma jus hawk 'em
Cuz niggas is waitin for a lawsuit, it's hot and they walkin
They sendin dudes up like clockwork
Niggas that can't hold it down usually come home with artwork
Ain't no such thing as a smart jerk
Then again, one fuckin dumb-dumb can make your heart jerk
D-Block nigga, we got work
That old school grey shit, uncut, got niggas pops hurt
You ran off Broadway, I get top work
Minority report, you don't know what you got murk, that's why..

[Chorus: Benzino]
Everybody wanna call your name
Until you squeeze them chromey thangs
Everybody wanna call you out
Until you pull up at the house
And everybody wanna try and bluff
Go head nigga press your luck, what's up?
And everybody wanna call your name
Don't wait, jus please call my name

[Jadakiss]
Dear God I got eighty five forty five bullets in the Tommy
With a extra thirty clip in my back pocket so try me
I'm on the yellow lines on one knee
Tryna hit a nigga in a building in One-D
Yeah, D-Block, you hatin the unity
I bring it to your motherfuckin gated community
In case you ever get it in your mind again
Twenty lil dirty niggas, with no guns throwin Heinekens

[Benzino]
By the time you hear this verse, I done staked you out
Me, V nailed and hearse, layin at your house
We screwin silencers, put a muzzle on that AK
Rip that nigga shit in half, make that bitch pay
Annihilate, every piece of ground you walk on
No need to talk on coward, I get my chalk on
It's always one nigga on the side
Talkin out his mouth next thing you know he bleedin from his side

[Chorus]

[Benzino]
Are you crazy?  I was in the dirt since '87
If war is hell, then will I ever go to heaven?
The D duck, Zino bring the Tommy when I re-up
Four and a half is nothin, get your ki's up
You boys stop bluffin, before you get beat up
Take your car keys, throw your ass in the trunk
Slide off with your bitch, L.E.S. track bump
Cats still can't figure me out (What?)
Askin how this nigga in the game gained so much clout?
Fuck whoever wanna claim king, I lay you down
Take your chain and your ring, you can keep the crown
I told your man the same thing, he can eat these rounds
Lacerate your face, pistol whip you unconscious
Your block never did so I know you can't want this
You rap a good one, but I see it in your eyes
You like to bang on wax cuz you don't wanna die

[Chorus]

[Outro: Benzino]
Un hun, un hun-un
Un hun, un hun-un
Un hun, un hun-un
