Kiss my ass !
Yes sir !
I don?t care who you are
I don?t care what you do
There comes a time (uh huh)
Everybody?s life (yup!)
When?
You just gotta tell a motha fucka

Chorus:
Yo, If you blatantly hatin' and waitin on my downfall
Then just be patient, and kiss my ass!
If you didn't believe and you had a problem
With my previous l.p's, then kiss my ass!
If you downright spoiled and feel I don't do enough for you
That's right, kiss my ass !
Pop off when you see me, keep it movin or breathe easy
Whateva, kiss my ass!

Verse 1:
Yo everybody love him
Every body know him
He gettin money now
Everybody think he owe em?
They stay askin him for weed plants like he grow em'
They know if he catch em? violatin he'll blow em?
Always wanna know what he doin where he goin
What chain was he wearin, what he drivin ,was he glowin?
Who givin him head, who he hittin, who he go wit
Who u seen him in the mall, or creepin out the mo? wit?
Roc-a-fella, def jam, the right label to go wit
And when the album drops, are they really gon promote it?
Is L.A behind the project and are you focused?
I just smile and ask them back, why you wanna know this?
Everybody got they hands out, here we go again
You ain't buy none of his albums, you downloaded them
He ain't got no security, the pound?s holdin him
And if he never told you before, you now know it then

Chorus:
If you blatantly hatin' and waitin on my downfall
Then just be patient, and kiss my ass!
If you didn't believe and you had a problem
With my previous l.p's, then kiss my ass!
If you downright spoiled and feel I don't do enough for you
That's right, kiss my ass !
Pop off when you see me, keep it movin or breathe easy
Whateva, kiss my ass!

Verse 2:
I don?t care about your hair or your nails
I ain't got no bails and no lawyers for niggas that caught sales
I don?t care about your rent or your mortgage or the cocaine shortage
Or how many times you been distorted

And I ain't got a dime for the limo, for your prom, betta get it from your mom
Or get up on ya grind
I don?t wanna hear the garbage about how u need your car fixed
Or money to get back and forth to the doctors
Don?t try to seduce me cuz I ain't got a quarter for a Lucy
Just give me a dap or salufe me I don?t wanna hear the sorrow I ain't got nothin to borrow
I?m goin on tour so I won't see you tomorrow
I don?t care about the drought, or how much the price change
What u almost did with the bank, at the dice game
And I?m sorry if I forgot, to tell you how I felt but I really mean it a lot

Chorus:
If you blatantly hatin' and waitin on my downfall
Then just be patient, and kiss my ass!
If you didn't believe and you had a problem
With my previous l.p's, then kiss my ass!
If you downright spoiled and feel I don't do enough for you
That's right, kiss my ass !
Pop off when you see me, keep it movin or breathe easy
Whateva, kiss my ass!

Verse 3:
Yo you outside standin around, front of the club
Coulda been went inside, it only cost you a dub
What u tryna wait on me to get in free
Only thing is we ain't spoke since 2003
So I act like I don?t know you when I see you in the town tomorrow I gotta blow you
This is what I go through
Now I got a lawsuit and u got a velour suit
Some bullshit jewelry from canal and a 04 coupe
The car coulda been better, for that to be the case
The scar woulda been better
Screw a vendetta, you show it you betta pull it
But since u tryna count my money then count bullets
Soon as u allow it instantly you become a liability to cowards
Cheaper to send them flowers
By now you should know it, this is how I feel and how I?ve always felt
Even though I don?t show it

Chorus:
If you blatantly hatin' and waitin on my downfall
Then just be patient, and kiss my ass!
If you didn't believe and you had a problem
With my previous l.p's, then kiss my ass!
If you downright spoiled and feel I don't do enough for you
That's right, kiss my ass !
Pop off when you see me, keep it movin or breathe easy
Whateva, kiss my ass!
