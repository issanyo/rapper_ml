You know how Kiss come thru fitted hat low and
Everybody staring at the whip before they go in
Finally they get in, and you know we came deep
But big man talking bout they'll only let 10 in
Straight to the bar set it off with a mean shot
32 in the boot, got me with a mean bop
Looking for a hot piece
Ready to smack the next cat that tell me that he rap or he got beats
Alright money spit something
Here matter of fact get you a drink go try to hit something
I like they ass and hips around 3 size
And they don't gotta rock Frankie B's I'll take Levi's
Think I see something I want
Finna dump me a dub
Then try to go bump me some love
D-Block, Double R we been thick
All it takes is a hundred G's to get sick
