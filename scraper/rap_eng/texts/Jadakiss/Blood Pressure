[Intro]
The headphones is on fire dis time around, Styles
My blood pressure is building
Yo, last time I'mma tell these niggas, man
Niggas can't fuck around me
Jada, man, whoever, old nigga, new nigga

[Verse 1]
Who really the best rapper since B.I.G. ain't here
Y'all know the answer to dat when Kiss in here
When you see me, don't ask me nothin' about us
And don't definitely ask me nothin' about
Fuck it, you owe me one, I owe you two
I woulda' smacked you with the burner, but I know you'd sue
And I ain't talkin' to him, I'm talkin to you
Matter of fact, I'm talkin' to y'all
Life is like walkin' a yard
Niggas will stab you with a fork in the heart
And The Source got muthafuckas thinkin' they hot
Like my dope, got fiends thinkin' they shot
When you thinkin of da best, nigga, think of The Lox
I'll cut your fuckin' hand off if your pinky ring is hot
Then come through your block in a sticky green drop
Hop out, let off fifty-three shots
Wouldn't care if I hit fifty-three cops
Guliani might as well be murkin' niggas
Cause the time that he givin' out is hurtin' niggas
And all these record label's jerkin' niggas
And you never was a thug, you's a workin' nigga
And you heard that shit right there? I started that
Don't make me put somethin' up in your Starter hat
No matter who you are, or where you from, screw all of that
I'm not tryin to hear that, son

[Chorus]
Now, who the fuck y'all want? (Jadakiss!)
And who the fuck y'all need? (Jadakiss!)
And who the fuck gon' bleed?
All y'all haters
Cause none of y'all niggas can't fuck with Jada
Now, who the fuck y'all want? (Jadakiss!)
And who the fuck y'all need? (Jadakiss!)
And who the fuck gon' bleed?
All y'all haters
Cause none of y'all niggas can't fuck with Jada

[Verse 2]
Don't you be that clown nigga in the back of the whip
That's gon' get the second half of the clip
And all I'm sayin, it'll be da other nigga in the front of the da whip
Runnin his lip, wit a gun on his hip, feel me dawg?
Everybody walk da walk 'til they run into Kiss
Then, they get stabbed, or hung, or stung wit da fifth
How you think ya man hard when son on my dick?
Cuz I can get his ass body, plus front him a brick
Got a chick named Superhead, she give super-head
Just moved in the buildin', even gave the super head
I cop big guns that spit super lead
So play Superman, end up super dead
Call me Kiss, or da kid from The Lox
That'll twist ya moms out and do a bid wit ya pops
We was in jail, you probably won't get no mail
And if you pumped on my block, you won't get no sales
When ya CEO know you can't fuck wit I
I make a million by June, I'm sayin fuck July
And I beg you to try me while I'm holdin da Tommy
I'mma have ya body all over da lobby
I already helped y'all, I'm about to melt y'all
Tell the truth, dawg, I ain't never felt y'all
This album, we gon' bubble like Seltzer
If it ain't Double R, who da hell else is hard?!

[Chorus]
Now, who the fuck y'all want? (Jadakiss!)
And who the fuck y'all need? (Jadakiss!)
And who the fuck gon' bleed?
All y'all haters
Cause none of y'all niggas can't fuck with Jada
Now, who the fuck y'all want? (Jadakiss!)
And who the fuck y'all need? (Jadakiss!)
And who the fuck gon' bleed?
All y'all haters
Cause none of y'all niggas can't fuck with Jada
