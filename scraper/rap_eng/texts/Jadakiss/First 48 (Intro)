[Intro]
Uhh, uhh, yeah
Right now I just wanna say thank you, (thank you.. haha)
For your downloads, ya streams, ya hard copies (haha)
Whatever means of purchase
Even if you bootlegged this joint, I appreciate you, haha
We four projects in, a whole lot more to go
Thanks to all the support, riding out with ya nigga
Despite what you may think or what you may have heard
I am... (HA-HAAAEEH!) Top 5 dead or alive

[Verse]
Yeah, yo
Everything is real, ain't nothing cozy
Fresher than a young nigga, mind of a OG
Inhale, exhale, yeah cherish every breath
Shining like I just came home, but I never left
Most of them is loving me, some of them is hating me
Say he's underrated depending on whose rating me
I be destroying niggas on tracks, blatantly
Basically I'm patiently waiting for a vacancy
It ain't hard to tell, they all scared to challenge him
Money power respect, I learned how to balance them
Watermelon over the pump, the hood silencer
Couple hundred thousand a month is a good calendar
Yeah, they love to hear the don speak
That's because my dialogue ain't in arms reach
Nah, I ain't with the coward ish
First the skinny jeans, now they wearing blouses
Don't ever confuse wireless for powerless
A nice red wine, haze and a sour mix
I'm in the trap with the blicky
Cigarettes, pills and the sticky, if you need something hit me
When it's popping I breeze quickly
To ya door step if ya copping at least 50
Never mix my feelings with my dealings
I'm house shopping for wood floors, high ceilings
200 or more on the dash if I'm wheeling
Really these niggas just mad 'cause I'm chilling
Face on the Master is mother pearl
I maintain 'cause I dominated the underworld
If you sick to ya stomach that mean you wanna earl
The moon and the stars'll tell you that son is thorough
I'm getting better every week
And I don't talk too much, the longevity will speak
They ain't selling you nothing you think its better cause its cheap
With the push of a button I'll get you wet up in the street
Its never been even, I'm one of the best breathing
Y'all red shirts might be ready by next season
And the spread is too high is nothing I just tease 'em
More celebrating this year and less grieving
But I'm always down for a funeral
For nigga hating while I'm trying to do my numerals
Screw faces, side glances
6 shooter, headshots, 5 chances, 25 large or 5 dances
As you can see I'm fascinated with the finances
Nah, he don't play
And he'll forever be Top 5 D.O.A., nigga!

[Outro]
I am, (HA-HAAAEEH!)
Top 5 Dead or Alive...
