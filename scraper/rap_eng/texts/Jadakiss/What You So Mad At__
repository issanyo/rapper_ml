[Intro]
HA-HAAAEEH!

[Chorus]
What you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink, let's all get down
Roll somethin', smoke somethin' let's blow this pound
Know if somethin' jump off we gon' hold this down
Wow, what you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink, let's all get down
Roll somethin', smoke somethin' let's blow this pound
Know if somethin' jump off we gon' hold this down

[Verse 1]
Uh, me and honey on the dance floor just flexin'
Til the neck on my white T start stretchin'
Liquor comin' outta our pores and we sweatin'
But that ain't slowin' us down, we still steppin'
Her gear is strong, her hair is long
Her feet is small, and she smoke weed and all
So we gonna pop us a bottle, and blow us a good spliff
V.I.P. is crowded but they all look stiff
I'm well connected, I got wolves over there
And niggas that act like pitbulls over here
Yeah, I'm just doin' my 1, 2 and shit
She's shakin it, doin' that St. Louis shit
With her back in it, so I put my bones in it
The Rose gold prezzie got the pink stones in it
Why you want drama with me, I ain't gon' blast you
Before I put the money on ya head I'ma ask you, nigga

[Chorus]
Wow, what you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink, let's all get down
Roll somethin', smoke somethin' let's blow this pound
Know if somethin' jump off we gon' hold this down
Wow, what you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink, let's all get down
Roll somethin', smoke somethin' let's blow this pound
Know if somethin' jump off we gon' hold this down

[Verse 2]
Yo yo yo, I'm everything controversial
Underground, gangsta rap slash commercial
Ya but still all it takes is a long dutch
For me to get your wifey up out of her Von Dutch
As far as the funeral, we got it, its on us
Niggas ain't crazy, they just on dust
So let me get another round
Now Hypno and Clico will sit a brother down
Haze'll have you feelin' like you in another town
Then its time for the gangstas so get the rubbers now
K I two of them swirled things
One more drink and ya boy might be doin the earl thing
Ma, it's me, you and whoever ya girl bring
Meet me in the back, I'm outside the pearl thing
I got the trey pound hooked on my waist
When they mention my name around other rappers
Look in they face and say

[Chorus]
Wow, what you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink, let's all get down
Roll somethin', smoke somethin' let's blow this pound
Know if somethin' jump off we gon' hold this down
Wow, what you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink, let's all get down
Roll somethin', smoke somethin' let's blow this pound
Know if somethin' jump off we gon' hold this down

[Verse 3]
Can't knock a nigga that didn't make it if he tried
Far as me though, my spot is solidified so when I hit my number
I'ma hit it high and when I'm dead and gone
They gonna say I did it live
Cause I done been too nice for way too long
They can't hold me back I'm way too strong
Double R and D-Block
That's what it is and that's what its gonna be
We gettin' it on I just wanna know

[Chorus]
Wow, what you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink, let's all get down
Roll somethin', smoke somethin' let's blow this pound
Know if somethin' jump off we gon' hold this down
Wow, what you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink, let's all get down
Roll somethin', smoke somethin' let's blow this pound
Know if somethin' jump off we gon' hold this down

[Outro]
What you so mad at now?
Let's all get down
Let's blow this pound
We gon' hold this down
