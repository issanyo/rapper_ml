[Intro]
Yeah, this song right here
Is about a young man
Who's endured a lot of twists and turns in his life
Cause he always kept his head up, stayed focused
This man's name is Mario Winans, listen

[Chorus - Mario Winans]
What makes you think I can't make it?
Put me to the test, I'll take it
I've been through more trials
But I've overcome all of them
And I've never been one for faking
I kept on moving and shaking
And that's how I made it

[Verse - Mario Winans]
I've seen it all
But I never let no one
Tell me it's right, when it's wrong
Cause I heard it all before
And it gives me a reason to fight for
A right for, to do what I gotta do

[Chorus]

[Verse - Mario Winans]
All of my life
I was told that you had to go through
Just to get where you want
And if you come across a storm
You just gotta keep holding on, and stay strong
And do what you gotta do

[Chorus]

[Verse - Jadakiss]
Aiyyo you can hit the dance floor now, you ain't gotta wait
We can take this outside, you ain't gotta hate
This here is a family affair, the family is here
Everybody put your hands in the air
And we don't need no hateration
Somebody better calm duke down cause the eight'll lace him
So while you're waitin get it perculatin
Love to smoke preferably purple haze and, sharp as a buck fifty
Doin my dance and honey mad cause she can't keep up with me
But I'm still bangin 'em, soggin 'em, still robbin 'em
And the whole world know Kiss is a problem
But I ain't come to fight, I came to have fun tonight
And hit more than one tonight

[Chorus]
