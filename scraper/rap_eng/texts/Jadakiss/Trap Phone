[Verse 1: Belly]
Yeah, look
She used to sell me dreams by the milligram
Chasin' highs we'll never feel again
I told her bring it back and make it real again
I told her bring it back and make it real again
Still got your number in my trap phone
I hit the pussy, get the same high
I know your homegirl waitin' for you back home
I pull up and fuck you at the same time
I won't ever hit you from the main line
Got some nerve blowin' up my land line
Bitch, you must be out your damn mind
Bitch, you must be out your damn mind
Locked inside the room, just the two of us
What made us love each other is what ruined us
I almost overdosed in the hills again
Tell her bring it back and make it real again
I only hit you from the trap phone
Come pull up and get your back blown
Close the door and put the latch on
Won't save her but she hit me on the bat phone
Bitch, you got me poppin' pills again
Hittin' Vegas with a mil to spend
You got the wave, baby, I just want to swim again
Ooh, bring it back and make it real again
Woo, phone blingin', my phone blingin'
Phone blingin', my phone blingin'
I could sell this line for like a quarter million
I could sell this line for like a quarter million

[Break: Belly & Jadakiss]
Trap phone
Trap phone
Trap phone

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Know we got whatever, what you tryna spend, God?
I don't pay the bill, I just change the SIM card
They say tomorrow ain't promised so I'mma live it up
If I don't got your number saved, I don't give a fuck
I'm in the sky gettin' high my crew is the hardest
A hundred K every day as soon as I charge it
And I pray that them people don't properly get me
If get bagged, I'm keepin' it on my property with me
Whole lotta bad bitches that's plottin' to hit me
I can't wear your shoes, dawg, they not gonna fit me
The heart of the city, yeah I'm the backbone
And I'm ready to die over my trap phone

[Verse 3: Belly]
I only hit you from the trap phone
Come pull up and get your back blown
Close the door and put the latch on
Won't save her but she hit me on the bat phone
I'm too numb to ever feel again
Trying to find out where the feeling went
Told her bring it back and make it real again
Told her bring it back and make it real again
She used to sell me dreams, 'bout a milligram
Chasin' highs we'll never feel again
Told her bring it back and make it real again
Told her bring it back and make it real again
I only hit you from the trap phone
Come pull up and get your back blown
Close the door and put the latch on
Won't save her but she hit me from the bat phone
Phone blingin', my phone blingin'
Phone blingin', my phone blingin'
I could sell this line for like a quarter million
I could sell this line for like a quarter million

[Outro: Belly]
Trap phone, trap phone
Trap phone, trap phone
Trap phone
Bitch, you childish as fuck, stop tryna act grown
