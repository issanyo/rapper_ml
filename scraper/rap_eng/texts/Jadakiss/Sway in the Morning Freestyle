[Intro: (Sway), Jadakiss]
(Wanda, drop a beat on him, just in case he ready)
Woo, yo, yo
(Ok)

[Freestyle: Jadakiss]
This is kill rap
I've been the best, and I'm still that
Fuck the politics, where your skills at?
You ain't touchin' the people, so they don't feel that
Movin' too much of that diesel, these niggas will rat
Out in the field rattin', only makes you a field rat
You ain't gon' let it go? Then you better conceal that
Date of birth, date of birth, real stats
I ain't just talkin', I'm speakin' real facts
Five O can be right there, niggas will still clap
Where the liquor? And the weed? Where the pills at?
Big knots in every pocket, they still fat
Honey wanna give me the pussy? I'mma drill that
Long as the money's in coming, I'mma still stack
Yeah, hol' up *sniffle*

[Outro: Jadakiss]
That got me outta my element
