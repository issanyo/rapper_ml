"I knew that was a great one when Em[inem] called me to talk about that line,"
Jadakiss says in an interview with XXL
"That’s when I knew that was a good one
He felt that line just as well as you felt it
This is when I was thinkin’ about it
That was a pat on the back for me
I felt good getting a call from one of my colleagues that I got a lot of respect for to feel that bar right there
That probably helped to get him on there, liking that joint."
