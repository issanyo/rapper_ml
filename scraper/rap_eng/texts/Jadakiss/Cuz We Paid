[Intro]
You know popes in the Bible they say
Money is the root of all evil
Need I say more

[Verse 1]
Staring at the clouds looking out the jet window
Puffing on the loud thinking bout my dead kin folks
I was always taught to let it go until the pen broke
Would the outcome have been the same if i'd been broke
Still going through it tho flow still fluid tho
Money can’t stop the pain it can sooth it though
You don’t’ maintain your sanity you can lose it yo
Tricking all on a coke whore or music ho
Business is all risky, at the end of the day hundreds is all crispy
Yeah nigga, I’m in that thing you can’t miss me
A bad bitch on her way to come twist me
That don't mean shit tho the pounds and the bricks go
Dealing with some issues that currency can’t fix though
Stressed out so we smoking that and drinking that
Meanwhile you probably looking at us and you’re thinking that

[Hook]
Just cuz we paid
That don’t mean everything is okay ,hey
No, and just cuz we paid, just cuz we paid
That don’t mean everything is okay

[Verse 2]
Death is guaranteed, sometimes it’s a warning
So I wake up and try to make a million every morning
You ain’t gotta rap to feel the way I'm on it
Hustlers mentality is still the way I’m on it
Frowns, smiles, tribulations, trials
Heroin in the bags , crack in the vials
So raspy tee ,snap back in the khaki's
If he got all the money why he ain’t never happy
If real recognize real , why he never dab me
He follow me on Twitter but he never @ me
New seven series wishing they made a wagon
Situations be real more than you can imagine
Royalty is something you can’t worship
And loyalty is something you can’t purchase
Going through it so Im smoking that and drinking that
And when you see me automatically, you’re thinking that

[Hook]
Just cuz we paid
That don’t mean everything is okay hey
No, and just cuz we paid, just cuz we paid
That don’t mean everything is okay

[Verse 3]
All praises to the most high
Without a doubt hands down we’re the most fly
Whole group and the truth nigga no lie
Chipped in first advance bought a whole pie
But a nat to infinity I’m just one third of the trinity
Top five when you think of rap
Now that you know you can stop thinking that

[Hook]
Just cuz we paid
That don’t mean everything is okay hey
Just cuz we paid, just cuz we paid
That don’t mean everything is okay
