[Verse 1]
I go to sleep and see a ki'
Tucked inside a duffle Tryna be up outta reach
It's like it came to life and it was sweet enough to speak
Told me call a couple friends of yours and lead me to the street right?, peep it
I go to sleep and see a key, opening a Rover
Same way they used to show us
Told em pay us like you owe us but attention you can keep
Said it's better when it's quiet baby slip that underneath
So to tuck away the convo, conversing in morse code
Seem like everything it should be, til they're beyond those
Putting everything on your leap unless the alarm broke
A ki' might lead to a key to where Nia Long go
Visionary riches turn to missionary missions
But fuck if I'm sitting still unless I'm sitting near a digit
Bet you you'll reconsider if you consider where we get it
The sweetest shit that you ever dreamed, til you arisen like wait, hold up

[Hook]
I go to sleep and see a ki'
Sleep kinda different
When it's begging you to get it
I mean, peep it
I go to sleep and see a ki'
Sleep is out the norm
But I'm wit it til the morn
At least, peep it

[Verse 2]
I go to sleep and see a kilo
Dressed as opportunity, hand over the peep hole
Collecting my gratuity, married to the reload
As long as we repeating we'll never be with the repo's
Call it how it be but we'll never be with the belows
If we looking underneath then we looking up under seats
Now look up at your beliefs, and down at your wrist
Then you look up at what you need and blow it down on a flip
I'm just looking to get a key, the one for the door furthest
And the dream turned into short orders and tall murders
With a fist full of dollars ignorance is so blissful
Wishful in thinking where that ignorance can get you
Get us where we need and we'll call it even and leave
Oversleep cause you know it's easier there to breathe
And sleeping in the thought of the above off the love
Til the lock is all plugged and you banking on a key, you get it?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Starting to think I need counseling
Cause when I go to sleep I see 36 ounces
Damn, all I remember was the bouncers telling me put the smoke out
Tryna move this coke out, woke up in a cold sweat, then I broke out
Trine go back where I left, it ain't right tho
You know I'm in the kitchen to chef, straight nitro
Fiends say when they take a hit, it make the pipe glow
Hoping I see the same shit the next night yo
Great powder, we usually don't allow it
If this is what it's about, I'ma need my 8 hours
Cause dreams come true at the end of the day
Pray before I wake that I finish the yay
When you don't recognize your blessings you send 'em away
But let's keep that on the d­low
When I go to sleep I see a kilo

[Outro]
Baby, you need me. Wake up for me. I know you see me
When you wake up baby, come to me
Come back to me baby, let me be yours
Te voy a enseñar lo que puede llegar a ser conmigo
Todo lo que siempre has deseado era real puede llegar a ser real para ti papi
Lead me to the street, come see me baby
