[Hook: Cris Streetz]

I represent the right but I'm living wrong
Doing wrong to live right gotta keep it going
I just wanna keep my lights on
Shiiit I just wanna put some ice on
Everyday it be a struggle like a fights on
Mind focused on winning this be my fight song
I probably would throw it all away
Hood n*** make it back what the hustlers say
I probably would throw it all away
Hood n*** lose it all what statistics say
I probably would throw it all away
But I ain't losing nah.. nah not today
Nah not today
Probably would lose it all
Nah not today.. nah not today



[Verse 1: Cris Streetz]


Everyday we working
Shit ain't perfect
Bullshit trying to drown me
But my hustle is for certain
Life is what you make it
But some never learn like trying to right cursive
My back against the wall then I start to get assertive
N*** lost his job guess its right back to serving
Back to taking trips going deep like Irvin
Window starting to close shit starting feel urgent
We on a new wave ya ain't seen this surfing
Uptown n*** but my still been global
$200 shirts mask the pain that we go through
Rose through the concrete jungle that i grown through
Now its my time can't tell me what I won't do
Bad boy no puff here
But puff daily blowin loud packs in the air
$400 kicks fuck em up without a care
Ballin on a budget that shit don't exist over here
Flashy n*** homie PRIMETIME in his prime
Feds watching dying to charge a n*** wit a crime
I'm teflon ducking D's every single time
Middle finger to them snake n*** wit no spine
Living like a young n*** suppose to live
Chest full of smoke dark water for the kidneys
Riding with my team fingers up to who ain't with me
And I do it for my city NEW YORK never forget me



[Hook]

I represent the right but I'm living wrong
Doing wrong to live right gotta keep it going

Shiiit I just wanna put some ice on
Everyday it be a struggle like a fights on
Mind focused on winning this be my fight song
I probably would throw it all away
Hood n*** make it back what the hustlers say
I probably would throw it all away
Hood n*** lose it all what statistics say
I probably would throw it all away
But I ain't losing nah.. nah not today
Nah not today
Probably would lose it all
Nah not today.. nah not today



[Verse 2: Jadakiss]

I represent the right but I'm living wrong
I'm from where nigga put his heart in a song
I'm from where niggas with heart get it on
Tough guys and the cowards never get along
Just as quick as they come in we try to get em gone
If it was up to me I put my whole city on
He ungrateful so I don't got no pity for em
He need breast milk and I ain't got the titi for em
Clean up nice so I can get gritty for em
Point blank range wes and the smitty for em
Finger prints all over the K
I'm bout to just throw it all away

[Verse 3: Cris Streetz]

You never reach potential unless you taking chances
Then learn from mistakes like you enrolled in classes
From place where the youngest kids wind up in caskets
For a pair of Jordan's , leathers or the latest fabrics
Somebody's come up had to be so tragic
Nothing seem to soothe the heart when somebody passing
Am I any better trying to win
Get it at all costs ignoring all my sins
How can I feel so alone with all these fucking friends
How come I still feel empty even when I spend
All these broken thoughts all these clouded dreams
My progress never stop ain't no losing steam
Only losing sleep
Only losing fake people want me lying deep
Eyes open for the snakes who be trying to creep
Hope I live long enough to hear my nephew speak
Hear my nephew speak
Cuz that karma trying to catch up to a n***
Lost between chasing these dreams and chasing figures
I'm somewhere in the sky
I'm trying to live right

But I ain't losing nah.. nah not today
Nah not today
Probably would lose it all
Nah not today.. nah not today
