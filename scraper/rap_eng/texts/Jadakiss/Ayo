Uh collision, I'm a problem
And nobody can solve em, I'm long division
On the road of success but it's more of a mission
They said I would be dead or I was goin to prison
No one of them is certain but the other one isn't
Made rare decisions, rock diamonds that impared your vision
Even supplied ya'll for years with listen
Like I'm just starting but I got years of wisdom
Stripes I got nigga, it took years to get em
Whenever you see him notice his same peers is with him
He destroys tracks the minute he hears the rhythm
Not only a hell of a flow but his ears forbidden
And if you think this is a ring tone, yea you kiddin
Fifty thousand records sold, right yea you kiddin
It was his time to go he ain't care who did em
Didn't appreciate life and got aired for lying
PCP by the liter, good sheba
Sergios tech sweat suits, good Addidas
The jewels is invincible that we was suppose to get from them
Use to send them to the store, now we blowin piff with them
Nowa days it's different, I was fortunate
Cause I did alot of listening, the new era is missin it
Everybody three fifty seven and four fif'n it
Drug program two to four, three to six'n it
Feds send niggas way out by lake Michigan
Put the coke in the tires only if they Michelin
Never talk on the fone only deal with official men
You don't even know homie that put you in the shit you in
Gotta busy schedule and I don't think I can fit you in
What's good for me ain't good for them
No matter what set you claim or what hood you in
I hit you and I find you a wood box for them to put you in
Stay away from the people that act scary
The Maserati Gran Turismo is black cherry
People that control the world from black berries
But you will never know cus they keepin the facts buried
Before I had a deal I was movin them packs freely
Made a couple million of of rap & then I got greedy
Competition got so garbage it got easy
Then the internet kilt the game and it got greezy
Download upload before the dutch rolled
Not only that all the rappers got went into suck mode
Soon as the plague is done with, you know son spit
Let you get ya mind right, bypass the dumb shit
Before I hop in the league, you gotta pop it and leave
This is somethin you can pop in and leave
And I Know it's theraputic but be careful how you use it
Cause the flow might make your ear drums pop and then bleed
