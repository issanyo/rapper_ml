[Intro: NJ Threat]
Land of da lost
I'm talking land of da lost

[Verse 1: NJ Threat]
I know niggas runnin' from [?], still can't find their way out
Haters and broke niggas trying to see how it play out
Now that your pockets swell, nigga, what is yo' goals?
Yeah, you free, but you stuck like you're out on parole
This the life you immune to, til the shit consumes you
In too deep like Epps, now it's hard to exhume you
Jewels and fast cars can purchase the illustrated
But the price of that ain't you, so it keeps us stagnated
This the land of da lost and this no Will Ferrell
Cause it ain't funny when you stand at the end of the barrel
And your wife's in peril, you just bought the Camaro
And your brain's on the dash like [?] and Harold's
My cousin, was a brother that turned into a murderer
Got knocked and started quotin' [?]
I'm like Lord, please would you show us the signs
Inside this gang bangin' shit that's got us so intertwined?
Blind leading the blind, homie serving his moms
He said it must be the money like Deion in his prime
We come from a different fabric and far from aristocratic
Can't turn your back on these niggas, they might stab it
I'm feeling like damn as we cursed from a hex
And if it's not bulletproof, niggas ain't tryin' to invest
And our beautiful black sisters who's supposed to be queens
Gettin' dollars stuck in their ass like they vending machines

[Hook]
Land of da lost
I'm talking land of da lost
We are soldiers tryin' to become a boss
But the wrong move can get yo' ass soft, nigga
Land of da lost
I'm talking land of da lost
We are soldiers tryin' to become a boss
But the wrong move can get yo' ass soft, nigga

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Land of da lost
Started off doing stamps, turned into a boss
Got his hands on some grams, turned into a Porsche
They was there to snort, all your mans on the stand when you appear in court
Pointin' at you like, "Yeah, there go the boss"
They tellin' everything with no remorse
Niggas that you used to brag about and show 'em off
You tried to put him on, guess they tried to throw him off
Fuckery on the inside
The line between love and hate, you on the thin side
Especially now knowing that none of your men ride
Hands on the cross, land of da lost
Welcome to the...

[Hook]
Land of da lost
I'm talking land of da lost
We are soldiers tryin' to become a boss
But the wrong move can get yo' ass soft, nigga
Land of da lost
I'm talking land of da lost
We are soldiers tryin' to become a boss
But the wrong move can get yo' ass soft, nigga

[Verse 3: NJ Threat]
Wasn't astonished by Jay and Dame's relationship when it changed
Cause in my hood, mothafuckas was doing the same
See my homie in the club, poppin' bottles ain't nothin'
Couldn't even pay rent tryin' to keep up with that hype
They say watch where you give advice, a lot of people can't take it
Nowadays they get it misconstrued thinkin' is hatin'
Kids be killin' each other mainly over something petty
Could've avoid it, but he let him gas 'em like the getty
Plus Ms Gladys be killin' me, a damn know it all
Watchin' any and everything but our fucking cholesterol
They question my integrity and ask me how can I ball
Slinging that poison in that hood, but where the hell was y'all
When my pops was on it, and my aunts was on it
When they had company, it looked like their house was haunted
From facial sores and twitching jaws , sniffin' up the raw
Suckin' that glass thick, the weirdest shit I ever saw
As genocide run deep, it's hard for us to be reached
Rather listen to Nicki Minaj than a Farrakhan speech
My cousin doin' 30 split for a crime he ain't commit
Instead of tryin' to get her a pill, he worried 'bout other shit
Lost...

[Outro: Dr. Umar Johnson]
Land of the lost
Black people, this is the land of the lost, but this is not a land without a cause. We are the rebels with the cause. The Black woman and the Black man must unite side by side building strong Black families for a strong global pan-African revolution. Brothers and sisters from Los Angeles; Houston; Newark, New Jersey; Philadelphia; Wilmington, Delaware, all across this country and all across the world we must come together

This is the land of the lost, but this is not the land of the lost cause
