[Part 1: Groovy Tony, Produced by Tae Beast]

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q]
Blank Face, tre eight, kill everybody, fuck an AK
Sell narcotics and step my dollars up to Bill Gates
Push all limits, you lookin' timid, need to back off
Punk-ass cops, them crackers want us with our black off
Thug life, nigga since '96 I wanted to gang bang
Few years later I'm really from it, we were still kids
Crack off nigga, I'm squeezing empty 'til the shell break
Fuck my image, I need the drop, I need the Blank Face

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Cause brain damage from my mechanics, keeping two ways
Sell narcotics, I'm slanging diamonds with your pack then
Stack large commas, you with your riders with your backbone
Can't fold figures, I make deposits with the gold grin
Jeans look dirty, I lift the Chevy with the rims on
All bad bitches, they wanna fuck me with the cap gone
Real life nigga, I'm in the stu' 'til all the weed blown
Wait long, long, I hid the dope behind the cellphone
Y'all don't hear me, I want the money right, ugh
Groovy Tony, no face killer, I see the money right, ugh
Blank Face, clear everything out the safe
Crack the pig bank, robbin' your kids too
My heart an igloo, the devil in all blue, huh
Die now, go to Heaven, or bring 'em through
Lot of brown 'round here, got that white girl for you
And she swimming in fire water, could be double digits
Pistol through your Civic
Most die before they hear it, turn a nigga to a spirit
Drive slow, oh, hey, hit the curb with shattered mirrors
Look around now you're hell bound, boogie down
Bullshit I won't allow, slang a bird every hou'
Smack a nigga with the heat, contradicting, now you peace
Leave you triple six laying in defeat, can you dig it?
Struck a match, they won't finish
Drop a nigga off, get a nigga whipped
Squeezing fingertips, aye

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Exactly what I'ma have when the cops come
Body language's the same as when the shots rung
Holding a .38 and a shotgun
Real nigga, we all know you are not one, nah
Running with the rebels
It's a three-man weave with the Lord and the devil
Really all I need is a pitchfork and a shovel
If I can't proceed then I resort to the metal (Blank Face)
Getting high watching NBA League Pass (Who winning?)
With your family at the re-pass (My condolences)
My heart's getting colder
When I hug your mom and look over her shoulder
You notice I got the (Blank Face)
I ain't heard nothing, I ain't seen nothing
I ain't in the middle with nothin', no in between nothin'
Eff y'all, forever hate me
As I sit here while they interrogate me
I'm staring at 'em with the (Blank Face)

[Part 2: Eddie Kane, Produced by Dem Jointz]

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Top rack nigga and the money came with it, huh
New bitch with me, Hope the booty came with it
Came with it, uh, yeah, rims flying down the road, huh
Five in the morning, feds knockin' on my door, huh
Toilet full of dope, while my burner knee high
Tell me put the gun down, I'm probably gonna die
I know, I know, big guns sell dope
Eddie Kane's little bro, hundred k, one whip, hah

[Bridge 1: Dem Jointz]
Open Eddie Kane for hire
Been tryna get rich for hours
Nights like this I wish
Cocaine drops would fall, woo, woo, woo, woo...

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Yo, uh, yo, uh, need a car with no mileage
Kristoff on my palate, my cigar full of cabbage
Came from the dirt to the carrots
Getting dirty dollars, four different baby mommas
Dope between the speakers, so fuck you, Mr. Teacher
'Cause the paper, I ace it, lead, they tried to erase it
But I'm still standing, they mad and everything
Nothing given, I'ma take it first
On the trees like a hammock, flip the work behind the campus
Young Groovy turn your hood into a movie (into a movie...)
Gang bangin', dope slangin'
GTA-ing, shoot the whole club up
Fuck tryna sneak the K in, on the road to riches
Thank you Mr. Reagan, you helped them dollars rake in
And to my uncle that fucked up the family
That shit that you was smokin', I was pushin', residue lie on the cushion
I'ma blame it on your ass cause I ain't gettin' whoopings
And your proof is in the pudding
I'm just grandma's baby, Eddie Kane
(Eddie Kane, Eddie Kane) Uh

[Bridge 2: Dem Jointz]
Standing in the white light
And we on! And is there any other smokers in here? Huh!
And we on! And is there any other smokers in here?
And we on! And is there any other smokers in here?
Keys open doors on the road to my heart
Dreams on the floor, bet a nigga stay high, and I know
What makes the world go 'round, go 'round? Woohoo
What makes the world go 'round, go 'round? Woohoo

[Outro: Candice Pillay]
Walk right into the light
Getting a feeling in the night
Vengeance comes, spite for spice
You're my only Christ
I have only eyes for you
I have only eyes for you
Your soul is mine
Your soul is mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine
