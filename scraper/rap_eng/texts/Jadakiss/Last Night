Damn, party like a rockstar
Can't remember where I parked last night
No I can't move it two tings
And that's the only thing I remember parking that night
4, 5 bottles out the pocket last night
She was sippin' champagne like she copped it last night
Damn, can't even recall last night
But I know I had a ball last night
I think you got me fucked up, hoe
7 Bottles, and I'm kind of fucked up, hoe
Left the club, 8 cars in a race
She was lookin' up at the stars in the Wraith
Shit, I think I got her all off her pivot
She jumped in the car and I forgot to get them digits
Head smart so I gotta ball in the business
Sky's the ceiling, so you know my Lord was my witness
Nothin' but political
None of my niggas is hospitable
We don't give a fuck about no ridicule
Point blank, we'll put your ass in critical
Some of the better bitches, I hit a few
Some of the dopest spots with killer views
Kill or be killed
We playing killer rules
Nothin' changed, walk away a quarter mil in jewels
Champagne spilling
What more can I say with no ceiling
Cold hearted, I'm numb with no feelings
Know old niggas pack guns with gold fillings
Damn, party like a rockstar
Can't remember where I parked last night
No I can't move it two tings
And that's the only thing I remember parking that night
4, 5 bottles out the pocket last night
She was sippin' champagne like she copped it last night
Damn, can't even recall last night
But I know I had a ball last night
Spent a hundred racks last night
Smoking girls scout cookies with the wax last night
My niggas was turned up to the max last night
Couple four pounds on us, coupld Macs last night
Pretty face, slim waist, mami ass fat right
So you already know what nigga smashed last night
Did a buck eighty something on the dash last night
'Tron shots, fucked around and almost crashed last night
At the gun shot, niggas had a blast last night
I finger fucked it, cause all I do is stash cash right
Sold a lil weed but I had to pass that white
Tonight we gon' do the same thing we did last night
Damn, party like a rockstar
Can't remember where I parked last night
No I can't move it two tings
And that's the only thing I remember parking that night
4, 5 bottles out the pocket last night
She was sippin' champagne like she copped it last night
Damn, can't even recall last night
But I know I had a ball last night
Black magnesium, black sand beaches
Trips on low for your man to reach us
Bang glass table with a hundred grand pieces
Watch the bitches face when the Lamborghini screeches
I know what them bitches thinking like I had telekinesis
Cars that we drive they come with so many features
It wasn't for these bitches, how the fuck they gonna see us
So my niggas born hard, how the fuck they gon D us
I drop the top just to get a breather
Hopin' on yachts, that's just felicia
Shit, I treat Miami just like Ibiza
And my wrist lookin' just like a freezer
Damn, party like a rockstar
Can't remember where I parked last night
No I can't move it two tings
And that's the only thing I remember parking that night
4, 5 bottles out the pocket last night
She was sippin' champagne like she copped it last night
Damn, can't even recall last night
But I know I had a ball last night
