[Hook : N.O.R.E.]

Throw 'em under the bus!
Throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em, throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em under the bus!
Throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em, throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em under the bus!
Throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em, throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em under the bus!
Throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em, throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus

[Verse 1 : N.O.R.E]

Throw 'em under the bus
I'll drag a Mack truck through traffic
Your gangster is plastic, I cook it fantastic
Yup! Fantastico, dale mami so rapido
Even get brains while I'm stuck in the traffico
N.O.R.E.'s always there like dead pigeons in projects
Broke elevators, syringes and hood objects
N.O.R.E. don't [?] I don't like muscles
My American dream was nothing like Russell's
Hustler with a winners spirit, big dog
I usually drop in the winter period, so serious
Leave with a [?] show up with chips down
K Federline the game giving money a bounce
Bounce, who get's on top of you
I should be probably popping you
Throw you under the bus without rocking you
Always optional, jail is not an obstacle
One of my dudes go up, the coke price go up
Whole coast will slow up

[Hook : N.O.R.E.]

Throw 'em under the bus!
Throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em, throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em under the bus!
Throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em, throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em under the bus!
Throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em, throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em under the bus!
Throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em, throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em under the bus!

[Verse 2 : Jadakiss]

Up close I can give 'em the nine, hit 'em up nice
And throw 'em under Liberty Lines
I'm the nigga your team hate, swinging the thing great
Casket's empty, nothing to cremate
Listen, rubbing the wrong way cause friction
I put work in similar to Pulp Fiction
You go down south for a month and talk different
This dick suckings getting out of control
Til I fuck around and blow the spirit out of your soul
Have the wolves unscrew the earrings out of your holes
Blood drip inside of your mouth and outta your nose
When they found you they ain't even know it was you
When it get ugly cute niggas don't know what to do
Throw 'em under the bus, roll over his ducks
Talk about it while we rolling the dutch
Then we still screaming (what! what!)
When niggas get fucked up

[Hook : N.O.R.E.]

Throw 'em under the bus!
Throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em, throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em under the bus!
Throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em, throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em under the bus!
Throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em, throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em under the bus!
Throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em, throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em under the bus!

[Verse 3 : Kurupt]

I'ma throw the nigga off of a bridge
I'ma buss 'em, fucking chip 'em and spin
Throw 'em over the roof!
Rum [?] Hennessey [?]
I'm serious, sock niggas losing they tooth
Motherfuck that, you got my money nigga
I don't fuck wit ya'll out of pocked funny niggas
We stay active, buy coke with transactions
Interactive, what's happening, applause and clapping
This nickels strictly for you, I got two
CNN, DPGC all blue
You ain't ready for war
Got the four nigga get on the floor
Nigga... I got a better idea
Just listen to me, I'ma demonstrate what I feel
For real, I'm up on his heels
Got nine any time you feel

[Hook : N.O.R.E.]

Throw 'em under the bus!
Throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em, throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em under the bus!
Throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em, throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em under the bus!
Throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
Throw 'em, throw 'em, throw 'em under the bus
