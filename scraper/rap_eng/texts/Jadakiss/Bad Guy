[Intro: excerpt from the movie "Scarface"]
“You all a bunch of fucking assholes
You know why? You don’t have the guts to be who you wanna be
You need people like me
You need people like me so you can point your fucking fingers and say
"That's the bad guy"
So, what that make you? Good? You’re not good
You just know how to hide, how to lie
Me, I don’t have that problem”

[Hook One: Juelz Santana]
Uh, say hello to the bad guys
Feds taking pictures, HOPE THEY GOT MY GOOD SIDE
The price of life is getting cheaper
AND I'm JUST GETTIN' RICHER, LIL NIGGA
Nigga talking static I hear feedback; eat that
Niggas lame and they rejects, I see that
