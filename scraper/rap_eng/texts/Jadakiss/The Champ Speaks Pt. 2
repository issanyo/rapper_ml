Niggas is fucking uptight!
You already know
This is the one, baby!
What’s that nigga name? Justo?
Come see me this year, Justo
Only doing one motherfucking mixtape, and that’s it
Have my plaques, nigga!
I’ma be the first nigga slamming awards this year, too, on the awards show
You know, you gon’ see me on the Grammys for that “Why?” thing
You gon’ see me at mothafuckin’ Justo shit
For this shit, for the next Green Lantern shit
For these multiple Big Mike shits that we ‘bout to rip up
But um, fuck all that!
The champ is here! The game is mine!
Ayo, Green, Big Mike!
A-ha!
