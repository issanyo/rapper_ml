[Hook: Styles P]
First I counted a dollar, then I counted a million
Then I looked up to God like what the fuck is this feelin'
What the fuck is this feelin, what the fuck is this feelin'
Then I looked up to God like what the fuck is this feelin'
First I counted a dollar then I counted a million
Then I looked up to God like what the fuck is this feelin'
What the fuck is this feelin, what the fuck is this feelin'
Then I looked up to God like what the fuck is this feelin'

[Verse 1: Styles P]
First I gotta counted a dollar, then I counted a million
Got a strap on my waste, I got bricks in the ceiling
Couple niggas lost trial, and I hope they appealing
I scream D block, cause I know my niggas the realest
I get money from rap, but only fuck with the dealers
You know niggas that murder I got a couple of killers
My brother's kissing the Dom, niggas'll lick at your mom
And if I ever go to jail, they'll get up the bond
First I counted the buck, then I counted a m
Said what the fuck is this feeling,i had to count it again
We can skip in the Porsche and go bounce in the end
I get high in the crib that the fountains is in

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
First I counted a dollar, then I counted a millio
Okay here we go, got the game in the figure 4
You my girl walk pigeon toed, don't talk to me nigga
So much money you think I brought a vault with me nigga
The way I'm killing this pussy, I got chalk with me nigga
Redrum spelled backwards, that's coffin for niggas
Crib, car I'm poppin on niggas
Weed so strong got me coughin on niggas
My pajamas is a Polo Suit
So when I go to sleep it look like a photo shoot
4 door coupe, hundred just to park
Hustler of the year now my name is just because

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
First I counted a dollar, then I counted a million
My new connect is from Haiti, my old connect was Brazilian
I got two occupations and thats rappin and dealing
Got the team full of shooters, but personally I be chillin
Still got base heads that owe me, I let em go by the O.Z
Yellow gold or the rozzie the big face on the Rollie
D.I.E. from my fellows the J O or margielas
Co signed by Biggie so what the fuck can you tell us
First my palm started itchin and then I started twitchin
When that money is coming niggas start feeling different
They ain't hear you at first, now they starting to listen
Cause when you're standing out, a handouts a tradition
Ya heard me
