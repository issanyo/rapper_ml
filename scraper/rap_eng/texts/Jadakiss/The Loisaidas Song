(Right)

[Verse 1]
They don't know what to do with us
Like the Jeffersons we moving up
Coke, dope, weed, pills, meth and we move the dust
We don't know who to trust
Everybody snitching, everybody ratting
Niggas out here having lunch meals with the captain
Niggas getting to friendly not knowing who you dabbing
Won't get your ass a box on the top with a matress
Never, oh, let the money flow
Just took a hundered out the number, hoe
Loisaidas running everything, nigga
Even got the other side tryna' team with us
Act silly is you want, Mac-mili in the trunk
Dark leave a nigga back
Started as a peasant, turn from a have not to a legend

[Hook]
Give a fuck where your from nigga, Loisaidas
Car full of hood niggas, [?]
Niggas talk that shit, till they see [?]
Give a fuck where your from nigga, Loisaidas
