Hey, this a stoner music, man!
Stoner! Boner!

[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner!
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner!
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a motherfuckin' stoner

[Bridge: Young Thug]
I just put a forty on my wrist just like a bus
I just put ten thousand on my bitch just like a boss
I just drank with YSL just like a F- boss
Just like a f- boss, just like a

[Verse 1: Young Thug]

Thugger Thugger, you
I want Michael Jackson land, ohh
Aww I'mma cash out
I'm high as hell ain't got no satellites on me
I tell that bitch I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel just like Fabo
I'm back at it, Juug man voice (Yung Ralph)
Bankhead
Hear my song way from Y-T-C-R-O-B-S-M-M, now we YSL venom
Slime Thugger wit it, Slime DK wit it
Slime Wicced wit it, Slime Mondo wit it
Slime Slugger with it, Slime Bubba wit it
Slime Check wit it
Count hundreds and fifties off everyone's city

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]

Stoner, rotation three in slowmo
Ok, that's me, myself and I, so now I'm cheefin' solo
Why? Cause most these niggas is no go
Oh, no. I see y'all ho shit!
I believe my train of thought is cuckoo
I've got a locomotive
Baby girl I be the dopest, please then roll me up, I'll be good
Y'all see us, and y'all see them
If y'all compare, y'all not serious
I've got that tzz-tzz, Tom Ford
I've got that tzz-tzz, black orchid
I've got that tzz-tzz, Bob Mar
With that Jumanji decor
And I record, out of this world
Danny's gon' cop
Travis go roll, those are my dogs
One more animal, camel toe showing, camel toe roll
Now we at the mall, somebody goin' broke
Fellow, where's my dope?
In Atlanta where, so much damn Versace
How could I not be stoned?
Medusa, baby, what do you know?
You choose your nature, leave me alone
Rolex official in the Presidential
And the bitches love it like Olivia Pope
This is one flow, got one million more
And the city is mine
I'll just let you know
I've got ...
Put tray on it
I've got fats on
It cost a million more
I've got black on and I can rap on
Whatever track dog, I'm like a young quarterback
Running, quarterback draws million of yards
And never giving it up

I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner!
If you a roller, I'a roller so come over!
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner!
'less you police, don't look too deep beneath the corner
I'm a motherfucking stoner! Tell somebody bring the roll up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Run it, run it, up, like a dark trial
When you beat it, turn it, in a stone trial
We don't stay in line, get your shoes up your feet
Everybody stoned

Everytime I walk inside the club I see everybody looking
Oh, no, I'm a stoner, I can't love you...
Now, you can start my banana, but I won't eat your pudding
So come a little closer, I might know you
Andale, andale!
How the fuck I ... when there is a runway?
My thought is a match from the blood on my chest
She put up my dinner, she well like a fish
I took up a T-Rex stake, T-Rex

[Hook + Bridge]

[Outro]
I feel like Fabo!
I feel like Fabo!
I feel like Fabo!
