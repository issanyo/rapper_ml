Yo

Come on ma
You know I play hard ball
The triplex with them spinal steps
And them parkay floors
I just wanna lay you down
The way you look
The way you smell
The way you sound
And the way you be putting it on it
The nights alright
But nothing can compare to the morning
'Cos that's where the love is real at
Up and down, in and out, tell me if you feel that

Ooh, baby, I didn't come here to fight
Why you wanna mess with me?
Ooh, I'm always willing to compromise
But you ain't controlling me, no

'Cos I
Came here to make love not war with you, babe
So I try
To find some ways to make me feel good

Up and down, in and out
That's what love is all about
Always leaves both of us
Feeling good, I'm so helpless
Up and down, in and out
Love keeps moving us around
To feel the beat, like a drum
I don't know if I can catch the rhythm

Ooh, you know me better than I know myself
So why are you keep teasing me?
Mmm, I can't see me being with nobody else
'Cos you love me so crazy, yeah

'Cos I
Came here to make love not war with you, babe
So I try
To find some ways to make me feel good

Up and down, in and out
That's what love is all about
Always leaves both of us
Feeling good, I'm so helpless
Up and down, in and out
Love keeps moving us around
To feel the beat, like a drum
I don't know if I can catch the rhythm

Up and down, in and out
That's what love is all about
Always leaves both of us
Feeling good, I'm so helpless
Up and down, in and out
Love keeps moving us around
To feel the beat, like a drum
I don't know if I can catch the rhythm

Yo, you acting real lady like and I'm real hood
But at the end of the night we both feel good
And I don't wanna control you
I just wanna hold you
And I know I flip sometime
But I'm suppose to
And I don't mean to come off rude and all that
'Cos I know you in your sexy mood and all that
Nobody get wettier that you do
Believe me girl, I know you better than you do
Believe me it's always in the back of your head
How we go from the jacuzzi to the balcony
Back to your bed
So perhaps we discuss it a little
Can't change my attitude tough, baby
Just adjust it a little
And I'mma keep heat thug
Only time I disarm myself ma
Is when we make sweet love
Ha, I'mma protect home base
Can't catch the rhythm
We gonna go out of home base

You know I'm in a sexy mood
So why you gotta act a fool tonight?
You need to change your attitude
'Cos I ain't arguing with you
