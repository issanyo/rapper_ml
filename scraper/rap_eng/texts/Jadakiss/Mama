[Intro: Kodak Black]
This for ma dukes right here
This for the OG

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever

[Verse 1: TXS]
You're the definition of a queen to me
Mama when I see you I see royalty
When I'm broken, you know how to fix it
You know how to check me with the quickness
Anytime I made you mad and pissed you off
Talking back to you when I thought I was wrong
You showed me how to shake off the drama
I'm the woman that I am cause of my mama
Everything good in you is good thing inside of me
I'm just hoping one day I can finally
Say I grew up to make mama proud of me

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Mama you my number one
Never be another one
Ride or die by my side, even when the trouble come
[?] calamine lotion for the chicken pox
You would even hide the gun for me after lickin' shots
Send a prayer for me everyday, when I hit the block
Used to make me sweep the hallway, then I get the mop
Punishment when I fail, new sneaks when I pass
Only child so I had two feet in my ass
Now I give you the world, yea I'm talkin' long bread
All I want is peas and rice, collard greens, corn bread
Still lookin' good, dead broke or mucho dinero
I appreciate it all you will always be my hero

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
I wrote this song tonight for you
Nobody know me like you do
And I don't know how much I need to repay you
You never wash you hands with me and I thank you
Mama you my [?]
You the closest thing to Jesus
Know I put you through so much I hate it
Mama you my hero super lady

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever

[Outro: TXS]
You got me forever lady
And I'm gonna always be your baby
You gone always be my mama
Baby girl in the world
