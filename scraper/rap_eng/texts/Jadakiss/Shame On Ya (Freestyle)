[Intro]
Shame on ya when you step (ahaa)
Shame on ya
Shame on ya when you step

[Verse 1]
I'm the one man army Jason
I never been tooken out, I keep MC's looking out
Shout out to MC C in the Brooklyn house
Kill half his family, catch him cooking out
The movie gon' come shortly after the book is out
Its chess baby, the pawn and the rook is out
Niggas cleaned up here then they took it south
They was shaking then the feds came and shook them out
I remain raw, I know exactly what you came for
The wordplay that make ya brain sore
Massacred, no chainsaw
Your main chick is the gang whore (hahaha)
Different telly, same tour
If nobody don't die then it ain't war
If a fiend don't die, then it ain't pure
If you don't at least try then you ain't sure
But just know that when you rise, they gon' hate more
And make sure that when you die that you ain't poor
You get back what you give, don't expect more
Pills, weed, coke, dope, that's the connect 4
Right next store, another hunnid coming in on the next shore
Sure, strategise the block killas
Ratters filled to the top with cop killas
Distributors of the heroine, the top billers
You gotta be paralyzed to not feel us
Small fries in the eyes of Godzilla
By now you should realize the God's Iller
You just playing yo hand but I'm the card dealer
In NC, call us the Tar Heelers
Shame on you fake ass rappers and ya bar stealers

[Outro]
Mothafuckas
Jadakiss season
Shame on ya
