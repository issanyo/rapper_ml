Ugh
Yo check 'em out, its the new A5's you gotta rock em
They even put a zone in the league to try to stop him
He's the Answer and the problem, you don't want it with
The way that boy go to the hole and take punishment
The young boss of the cross for four quarters
And from three point land, he's all water
Matter fact, call him the king
The way he breaks down the defense
Its like he got the ball on a string
And he will blow by you fast
Penetrate and dish it off
Or let it go high off the glass, ugh
All you need is a pair of these, nothing else
Ya hesitation to stop and pop will be somethin' else
Trackmasters and J-to-da-Muah
I keep an extra pair in my car
In case ya wanna take it to the park, high percentage
I'mma make it from the arc, take it from the heart
Hehe, this is Kiss talkin to you, the A5 limited edition
Reebok brought em to you
Even on the court we stay fly, Jada and A.I
Make sure you go get the A5's
Even on the court we stay fly, Jada and A.I
Make sure you go get the A5's
