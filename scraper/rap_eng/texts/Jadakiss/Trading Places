.. is on the shelf bullets got their own closet
Call me .. positive .. even act the essays ..
What happened to fighting this dudes they go home
And start typing killing excite them .. I'll give it to any nigga right
Gorilla wolf cooked up with a Viking
Narrow it down to just two deals
I am on .. marijuana two wheels
I ain't doing nothing but moving a few pills
Since .. a bitch we're just getting a few feels
It's like the .. you don't wanna walk in
.. stables everything low in it
.. put an O in there
I am gonna make the room put a glow in there
Respect the athlete who pack up a rap shit
Probably the only art of you catch on a back street
.. was cracking plastic was popping
Row flow you know I don't stop it
Losing is a choice in life it's not an option
Just become a gangster by adoption
.. fuck with it can't stop them
Been ahead to hard you gotta drop them
Tell those boys that I .. you ain't in this game but
You understand what the rule is
Good with the bad .. with the bruises
Staying on point always know where the tools is
Just like riding a bike I'll never lose this
I've been Indian state ,is different dough
Don't ever confuse us she say I say whatever 
He thought he was fly go off after dark
Lot of niggers .. so I make them ask ..
The prices go high after dark
Lot of niggers being pop ..
But who am I to judge you ..
This is the appreciation I love you

Thanks to feel
