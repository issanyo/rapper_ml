(Jadakiss)
Everybody hustle, everybody catch bodies
Be the same niggas that I see at every party
Talking bout they got the 4-5th under the ruggy
But he on the dance floor, he doing the "Dougie"
Everybody got work, everybody plug me
Everybody lookin' fine nothing is lookin' ugly
Everybody's rattin', everybody's po-po
Everybody got a block but everybody broke though
That's just how the hood do
So do what you could do
All downs a bet, and everything is good too
Hits me with the war stories, everybody lyin'
If anybody violate everybody dyin'
