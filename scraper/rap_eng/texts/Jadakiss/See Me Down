[Intro: Lil Durk]
They wanna see me down
They wanna see me down

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Just wanna see my son grow up
Chicago streets, no love
I might not make it through the summer, but I cannot give up
They wanna see me down
They wanna be me now
Niggas catchin' cases
Dyin' on a daily basis
I stared from the basement
I used to sleep in basements
They wanna see me down
They wanna be me now

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
They don't want me 'cause my profile high cases
Being black tryna make it in this world, can't make billions like other races
If I call it how I see it they say I'm racist
Let's face it
If Donald Trump win the spot, then we back to the basics
No more link, no more WIC, no more free shots when you sick
No more S.S.I. checks, either coming for your kids
I'm for not who would of though I would make a million of of pot
Feds on me why you think I used to turn down all the slots
Tired of seein' my niggas die, on they days they momma cryin'
Opps crazy on IG tell them niggas calm it down
Heard niggas telling now, they come around I shut it down
And I keep a couple rounds
And I keep a couple rounds
BM trippin' see my son, he know I care
I grab my gun when I land in O'Hare
My momma stressing over me, she loosing hair
My cousin trippin', say I'm never there
Why? Then I say

[Hook: Lil Durk & Jadakiss]
Just wanna see my son grow up
Chicago streets, no love
I might not make it through the summer, but I cannot give up
They wanna see me down
They wanna be me now
Niggas catchin' cases
Dyin' on a daily basis
I stared from the basement
I used to sleep in basements
They wanna see me down
They wanna be me now

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Kick back, smoke, and I just tell my mans
Look y'all, we came a long way from selling grams
I'm tryna make a Mill, you tryna make a stack
When I leave I don't know if I'ma make it back
You don't need nothing to relate to that
The thought of my kids suffering, I hate the fact
Say goodbye to your mom, before you every think of doing me  bodily harm
Even though the war is on, you've got to be calm
It's a time to keep quiet, a time to respond
Nah, you'll never be fly as the Don
I shoot you man in his head, let him die in your arms
It's written inside of the Quran
They changed the Bible several times, something's got to be wrong
Check it for yourself, if you don't believe me now
They can't be me now, therefore they just wanna -

[Outro: Lil Durk & Jadakiss]
They wanna see me down
Chicago streets, no love
I might not make it through the summer, but I cannot give up
They wanna see me down
They wanna be me now
Niggas catchin' cases
Dyin' on a daily basis
I stared from the basement
I used to sleep in basements
They wanna see me down
They wanna be me now
