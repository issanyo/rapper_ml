[Jadakiss]
Ha, Parle'
Ruff Ryders
(Got me down the street)
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: Jadakiss of The LOX]
Yo
Catch me comin' out a red lobster
In a red Boxer
With a red bone and take headshots to Vodka
Nothing like a pretty chick, that's pretty rich
Who pretty lips and who smoke 50 nicks
The type you can bring around the fam and all
She get plain tickets, creditcards, scandin' off
And why'all know Jae, I, Swizz, honeys with Parle'
And I still gon get my money the hard way

[Chorus 1: Parle']
Just one hit of your love
Is exactly what I need
To get my high, (Got me down the street)
Get my to the places where I want to be
But instead, you got me in the streets (Got me down the street)
Fiendin' like a freak
Caught up in the mix
All I need, all I need's just a fix

[Parle]
Fix me with your love
Straight up (Say I'm straight up)
Just can't get enough of your love (Can't get enough of your love)
Hit me with the dub (two times baby)
And hook me up (High)
Want to get high up off your love (So high)

[Chorus 2: Parle']
Just can't quit, can't get enough
So addicted to the stuff
Get me high, (Got me down the street)
Tastin' your love baby's all I'm thinking off
In my bed, fucked up all the weed (Got me down the street)
I can't get no sleep
It's playin tricks
All I need, all I need is just a fix

[Chorus 3: Parle']
Fix me with your love (Fix me with your love)
Straight up (Straight Up)
Just can't get enough of your love (Can't get enough of your love)
Hit me with the dub (with the dub)

And hook me up (Hook me up)
Want to get high up off your love (So high)

[Parle']
She's the only thing in life I care about (Only thing I care about)
Can't live without (Can't live without)
Mix so loud
And anybody till A.G who cares about (Anybody, see me where I'm lovin)
Not makin' love without? (I need the lovin')
Mix so loud (I need the lovin')

[Verse 2: Eve]
Daddy you know the bid, mommy here a stimulate
Think you be ready for my lovin' on the first date
Blondie make 'em fiend, give 'em everything he need
Rydin' Ruff with a stallion, bring 'em to they knees
Tried to warn you first you ain't listen
Now you in a fucked up position, got you cleanin' up my kitchen
And the dishes and the gifts you givin' out
You got you dug out
Fiend of the tongue baby
And it's over got you strung out

[Chorus: 3]
