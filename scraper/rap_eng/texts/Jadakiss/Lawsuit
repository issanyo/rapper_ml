Jadakiss
Party like I got a lawsuit, yeah I'm in the Porsche coupe
Waiting for the 4 door to drop with the soft roof
And I can't be broken down at all mom, boss proof
Yeah I got them Ps wholesale I get em off 2
Blowin' Godfathers on the beach in a resort too
Very athletic, hustlin' is a sport too
9 stacks on me right now, nigga brought 2
If you was in the way when I was shootin', you woulda caught two Gotta lot of family in the feds, up north too
Man of the house, how you think I support you
Close your eyes, make a wish, you could thank the lord too
And I don't do it all the time baby but I ought too- Jadakiss
