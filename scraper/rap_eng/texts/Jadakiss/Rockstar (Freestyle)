[Verse 1: Nino Man]
Nino Man
I was fucked up growning on Lennox
So I had to hit the block hard
If anybody really wan' smoke
I would turn em' to a rockstar
Niggas doin' all this mumble rap
Just because they ain't got bars
You think he and his shorty going far
Til you find out she a thot-thot-thot-thot
Shorty tried to say I'm innocent
GS said no that nigga just pop
They hatin on me cause they see me on the floor
Shinin' like I just mopped (I'm in my bag)
If it's something fly that I like
I don't price, I just go cop (ju heard)
Bet they treat you different when you whippin'
And get yourself a dope watch
When people see you winning
They just wanna get in
But when shit was lookin' bad
They ain't wanna be friends (where ya was at?)
But now they pretend (where ya was at?)
Facts
All these money hungry bitches trynna get in my pants
But when I was wearing Levi
They didn't give me a chance
Now I'm in demand (ahhaaaa)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I remember I got bagged then I stuffed the drugs
In back of the cop car (I remember)
My man caught a bid, turned Muslim, came home
Now his name is Akbar (asalamalakim)
Be yourself, you make it a lot further dog
You ain't gotta act hard (for what?)
When your dope is good, fiends in the hood
All got the same as egg nog
At any given, incase you get caught slippin'
Yeah nigga you can get robbed
These niggas young and stupid
They don't think before they do shit
Poppin' pills, sippin' fluid with a nine in they hand
Fresh outta the can (haha, ay)
