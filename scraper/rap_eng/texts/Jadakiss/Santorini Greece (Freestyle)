[Intro: Styles P]
Yeah
Sometimes you just gotta light one and our a brown cup, you know
Shoutout to my nigga Rozay
L-O-X style
Shoutout to the legends who's name is never misspoken
You golden nigga
Yeah

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Sincerely I'm not offending y'all
Still play the Sheridan, still lay in a rental car
Fuck that, I still lease a whip
Coming from a strip where you can come through and lease a grip
Before '95, we were on some sneaker shit
Ridin down 95, coke in the speaker shit
We doing shows and we selling blow
Fuck about the state, respect the charge if it's federal
Yeah, the truck's got the vinyl in it
Riding with the nine on me, hollows and the rhinos in it
My nigga Smoke put me on the game
He said he got killed for doing life, shit it's all the same
Word to Nas, I'm in the street hall of fame
Poverty and crack in '86, yeah, it's all to blame
Spread all the love save all the pain
Your funeral or call to the plug can have it all arrange
All the same, how am I gonna board the plane
Give a nigga couple squares, you wanna see a baller change
Perpetual time, shoot counter clockwise
Nickname my gun toothbrush, open your mouth wide

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Up in the Hollywood hills I'm with this Asian actress
She like my conversation, she say I'm aging backwards
We sipping wine while blazing backwoods
For a long time I've been blazing rappers
I put it all away, every penny there
I can get her a Atlanta size crib, nigga, anywhere
Quarter mill' worth of jewels on at any given
This is the fully life, we ain't semi living
Before we blow it down go look at the venue
Everybody eats or nobody look at the menu
This is unwritten imagine the shit I could pen you
Cars, real estate, and artists the shit that I'm into
It's harder when you dumb when you smarter it's simple
I spit the razor out, give your part in the dimple
Either that or put the barrel on top of your temple
They don't want to pull the plug but the doctor convince you
Long way comin passing the work out
Sitting in the sauna after the workout
I still ride around with it on my lap
Yonkers, New York, we put it on the map

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
Open the window let my mama breath blow on my face
Still grab the burner when I leave like I'm moving base
Police watching like a nigga got a open case
Still amazed with all this money that I got in chase
Almost a million that this angel done left to me
A couple more that I done made with niggas next to me
In the hood to make it out your chance is tough
I ain't look back since we first did a deal with Puff
Now I walk on stage and absorb the love
But occasionally I look at my mask and glove
Back then social media was obsolete
Back then niggas had to be nice on a beat
I can't imagine no M.O.P. music for Sheek
New music nowadays only last you a week
Snitching nowadays is like nothing new
LOX the only group without them niggas in our crew
They say I'm underrated, I'm okay with that
300 thousand to my son, I let him play with that
Give you the scholarship I told him he can keep it all
Me and my bitch in Chanel once a week at the mall, uhh
