[Intro: Anthony Hamilton]
Lords knows I work hard
But I still gotta stay on my job
'Cause I ain't tryna get laid off
Won't stop until the day that I'm a boss

[Verse 1: August Alsina]
I know somebody tired of assisted livin'
Wakin' every mornin' sayin', "I gotta get it"
Focus on the paper can give you tunnel vision
Drug dealin', stackin', flippin' just tryna make a livin'
Baby shakin' on the pole just to make tuition
Single mommas facin' drama so they can feed they children
Niggas strung out on that dope just 'cause they had a taste
And niggas droppin' out of school on the paper chase
Who am I to hate? I ain't judgin' 'cause I can relate
Skippin' school, gettin' high, just tryna motivate
Just tryna make it 'til I make it to them pearly gates
Lost too many homies, can't face another wake
Another loss, another cop, another mistake, nothin' stand in my way
I went through a hurricane of pain and I'm standin' today
And if you outchea on your grind, fuck whoever hate
Just pay attention and concentrate

[Pre-Chorus: August Alsina]
Yeah nigga, it's crunch time
And I'm just tryna eat just like a kid at lunch time
And if you thought it was joke, it ain't no punchline
Ain't nothin' standin' in my way, I'm 'bout to get mine, it's hard work

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Lords knows I work hard
But I still gotta stay on my job
'Cause I ain't tryna get laid off
Won't stop 'til the day that I'm a boss, yo, it's hard work
Lords knows I work hard
But I still got to stay on my job
And I ain't taking no days off
Won't stop 'til the day it pays off, it's hard work, yeah

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yeah, I'm speakin' real so you gon' believe me
First of all, nobody said that it was gon' be easy
And you don't see the pain, you just see what's on the TV
When you don't let them keep the change, then they call you greedy
Now they all on social media talkin' greezy
Would get the guns but my sons and my daughters need me
I get it off soon as it comes, make your order speedy
I'm on a hell of a run, I thank the Lord completely
I'm puttin' overtime in, so I'm sorta sleepy
And I haven't slept in years, so that's sorta creepy
Gotta beat me fair and square but you ain't gonna cheat me
Carry the weight of the world on my shoulders weekly
Blame the universe, that's how the stars work
Yeah, play your hand that's how the cards work
Nah, ain't nothin' planned, this is God's work
Uh, we workin' hard 'cause it's hard work

[Pre-Chorus: August Alsina]
Yeah nigga, it's crunch time
And I'm just tryna eat just like a kid at lunch time
And if you thought it was joke, it ain't no punchline
Ain't nothin' standin' in my way, I'm 'bout to get mine, it's hard work

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton & August Alsina]
Lords knows I work hard
But I still gotta stay on my job
'Cause I ain't tryna get laid off
Won't stop 'til the day that I'm a boss, yo, it's hard work
Lords knows I work hard
But I still got to stay on my job
And I ain't taking no days off
Won't stop 'til the day it pays off, it's hard work, yeah

[Outro: Anthony Hamilton]
It's hard work, yeah
It's hard, it's hard work, yeah
It's hard work, yeah
It's hard, it's hard work, yeah
