Yo part 2 A.I. and J-Kiss presenting the A6
From the wrist can tell it's a straight swish
Now I'm the problem and he's the answer
As soon as you guard up you ain't got a
Chance to stop it anygiven time he can pop it
The Reebok A6 is hot go cop it

[Allen Iverson:]
2K3 I rock the A6 my new kicks
Take a few hits it ain't nothin I'm used to it
Tryna build a team I'm the player you need
Hard like Willis Reed I'll keep the score and the lead

[Jadakiss:]
It's no way to disguise your dream
Beside family the only thing that's on
His mind now is a ring
He got love for the game
His start was huge
And you seen him play hurt cause his heart is huge
6 feet 165 call iso anytime you wanna split your 5's
Play to win he don't play for stats
Brought the hood to the game and they love him for the braids and TATS
Yea, Trackmasters AI and J-Kiss make sure you go out and get a pair of the A6

[Both:]
Part 2 AI and J-Kiss presenting the A6 it's all fundamental and basics [x2]
