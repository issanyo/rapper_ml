Coz I ain't stressing over you
I ain't stressing bout you
I ain't stressing over you girl no
I ain't stressing bout you
I ain't
I ain't stressing bout you
I ain't stressing over you girl no
I can find somebody new
I ain't stressing over you
I ain't stressing over you girl no
I ain't stressing over you
I ain't stressing over you

[Verse 1]
Then we make up, we fucking all night I fuck her weave up
I'm a dog baby you know I can't leash up
One night baby you know I can't [?]
And you know I got multiple bitches
I ain't got no time for no nagging hoe
Going thtrough my phone while I'm sleep, that's a no no

[Chorus]
Coz I ain't stressing over you
I ain't stressing bout you
I ain't stressing over you girl no
I ain't stressing bout you
I ain't
I ain't stressing bout you
I ain't stressing over you girl no
I can find somebody new
I ain't stressing over you
I ain't stressing over you girl no
I ain't stressing over you
I ain't stressing over you

[Verse 2]
I got better shit to do
Why stress baby I can find a better chick than you
And I'm already the one, I ain't ready for the two
Getting money on me for [?] with the crew
Do it way big I ain't petty with the moves
At least you can walk away with your ass and your boobs
Keep the bags and Louibs, I know you got mad shit to lose
Yeah all I can say is best wishes
I was always taught never to stress bitches
I don't mind eating alone, it's less dishes
Scroll through my phone and search for my next mrs
No subs we ain't gotta throw it up
Long as we know whats up
We ain't gotta blow it up
Sip my [?] and blow my green
I just need you to know one thing

[Chorus]
Coz I ain't stressing over you
I ain't stressing bout you
I ain't stressing over you girl no
I ain't stressing bout you
I ain't
I ain't stressing bout you
I ain't stressing over you girl no
I can find somebody new
I ain't stressing over you
I ain't stressing over you girl no
I ain't stressing over you
I ain't stressing over you
