[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
I'm a D-Block general; I be bringin' paper in
Caught a bad deal in the beginnin', now I'm rapin' them
Pulled the Chevy out for the Summer on twenty-eights again
What is he, drinkin'? What is he smokin'? How he makin' them?
How has he been nice for so long? Why they hatin' him?
Got him doin' time in the box; isolatin' him
Got money, and he love pressure; they ain't breakin' him
Tight shirts, tight pants; all these homo-sapiens
All these niggas is trash, and they overratin' them
Put 'em in the booth with me; I'm annihilatin' them
Whoever you think is pumped up, I'm inflatin' him
Jail niggas, niggas in the hood; I relate to them
Blood money, and drug money; I was cakin' them
There when they broke the pies down, and was bakin' them
My enemies, I wish 'em all love, and I pray for them
Cause whenever we cross paths, that'll be the day for them
Thompsons, M-16's, and AK's for them
Can't just get one; bullets like Frito-Lays for them
Closed casket; leave nothin' but legs for them
Fuck mercy! No need to beg for them
Yeah, just let the devil deal with 'em
And the other niggas that squeal with 'em
Fuck-boys do fuck-shit
I wasn't before, and I'm still not to be fucked with..

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Now I'm leavin' to Cleveland with H-flow
Cavs game; got the cheerleaders givin' mad brains
Stop frontin', like you don't know the boy is wild
Before I knock you out, "Pretty Boy Floyd" style
Filthy-rich shit; minks on the car seat
And the gas pedal; shit'll make your heart beat
Niggas talkin' money, I don't really hear you
Cause you ain't do this yet; diamonds on the rear-view
And when the beam on you, I ain't gon' spare you
Lotta rappers talkin' peace; I don't really care to..
