[Intro]
..Helped me grow
If I'm only as good..

[Verse 1: Dre Lanski]
It's gotta be a dream
'Cause we got shorties walkin' 'round with mask on like its Halloween
They ain't gon' make to see twenty-three
They shootin' with they eyes closed on the line like they twenty-three
I turned the book into another key
Before the book it was a sixty-three, lets talk about consistency
Went on a yam and served all my grams
Damn near need to sanitize all these hand-to-hands
If you come up on my block and setup shop, we'll do you in
Your hair? We need a piece of that
The revenue? I'm keepin' that
Take it to the avenue back where I was sleepin' at
Lease the crib where I used to stash the packs
[?] crib, I sold the cracks
It was me the robbers tried to snatch
I'm still thankin' God that they didn't accomplish that
And ever since then, I never left without my strap
And everything I'm sayin' right now is all facts
Gettin' money, that's my occupation
Middle finger to any mother fucker that's out here contemplatin' on my downfall
Fuck it, I forever ball
You know my own team, lil' boy, I'ma stand tall
For this I used to pray, every night and day
Now the crib I'm sleepin' in, it cost four-hunnid K
The wife, she sleepin' good
Mom, she sleepin' good
Thankin' God I raised my son out the hood

[Chorus: Dre Lanski]
Dear Mr. President, I'm speakin' on my wrist watch
Oyster perpetual, got options when I switch clocks
I would sit and flex, I feel like that's a waste of rhymes
But I spent racks up on my wrist, so I ain't wastin' time
I bought a foreign, put the mileage on it
Designer head to toe, I'm stylin' on 'em
Watch the pressure pile up on 'em
Pistol, I'll get to wildin' on 'em
Real killers move in silence, homie
Enough said

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I got it out the mud 'til it turned into dirt
With the love and my hustle's what earned me the work
'Lil pain I was feelin', that buried the hurt
That just made my heart colder and very alert
They think I'm mad at 'em, I throw 'em a smirk
I could start killin' niggas, I go on a spurt
But I kept my sanity 'stead of goin' berserk
Now I don't want none of my daughters knowin' how to twerk
Cut a nigga hand off if it go up your skirt
We could take it even further, let bullets disperse
Naw, but you probably'll tell it
If you could pop, snort, inhale it, I probably could sell it
Yeah, I'm try'na get high with the fellas
Probably if I was you, I'd probably be jealous
Before I had the deal, I was already on
And before I crack 'em open, they already gone

[Chorus: Dre Lanski]
Dear Mr. President, I'm speakin' on my wrist watch
Oyster perpetual, got options when I switch clocks
I would sit and flex, I feel like that's a waste of rhymes
But I spent racks up on my wrist, so I ain't wastin' time
I bought a foreign, put the mileage on it
Designer head to toe, I'm stylin' on 'em
Watch the pressure pile up on 'em
Pistol, I'll get to wildin' on 'em
Real killers move in silence, homie
Enough said
