[Intro: Jadakiss]
HA-HAH!!!!!1 Slim!!!

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yo! Shorty somethin special, you already know that
Nice round hips, plus she got a throwback
I just wanna let her get acquainted with my bozack
After that anything she want she could hold that
I'm a get it in, but I'm a get it out quick
Million dollar whips hundred thousand dollar outfit
Tell me really what would the game be without Kiss?
On some G shit, this the remix

[Verse 2: Slim]
Just stepped out, fresh out the shower
Gotta stay fresh, take about an hour
Gotta get dressed, your boy so clean
Both of them on, I got the blue jeans
Fresh pair of shades, ice on my wrist
Socks to the draws, your boy stay fit
I'm ready (I'm ready) Can't nobody tell me nothin

[Chorus: Slim]
I'm so fly (I'm so fly) Feels like I'm takin off
I'm so high (I'm so high) Lookin for a shorty to break me off
I'm so fly (I'm so fly) Feels like I'm takin off
I'm so high (I'm so high) Lookin for a shorty to break me off
I'm so fly

[Verse 3: Slim]
Stop by Q's, pick my toy
Top drop down let the haters hear the noise
Hit that pad and turn that wheel
Push that rim make it all disappear
Phone is ringin hit the bluetooth
Call me on the phone like hey what it do?
I'm comin (I'm comin) And we gonna take this over

[Chorus: Slim]
I'm so fly (I'm so fly) Feels like I'm takin off
I'm so high (I'm so high) Lookin for a shorty to break me off
I'm so fly (I'm so fly) Feels like I'm takin off
I'm so high (I'm so high) Lookin for a shorty to break me off
I'm so fly

[Bridge: Slim]
As were headin to the club, everybody know what's up
Through the door, V.I.P
All the ladies go with me
Order drinks, come on in, everybody it's on me
Showin love, can't nobody tell me nothin I'm so fly

[Verse 4: Freeway]
Philly Freezer way flyer than them other boys yes!
Fly private take you higher than the Concord jet
Non violent but the pilot know them choppers on deck
Player only go retire to the island of your, choice
My swag and my voice makin them moist
And I been runnin around her mine all day it's time to rest
Hi Haters!!! Maino addressed them best
When your back we on the hammock cause I'm taster's choice
It's the east coast remix stuntin on them people
We get it in the boy Slim, me, Kiss
Your now rockin with them ROC Boys D Boys
Matter fact bout to take you back, peep this
My drop top's in the parkin lot
And I wanna get you back to the spot
Time to roll with the frontline of the ROC
Janet Jackson with this rappin cause I'm back in control, let's go!!!

[Chorus: Slim]
I'm so fly (I'm so fly) Feels like I'm takin off
I'm so high (I'm so high) Lookin for a shorty to break me off
I'm so fly (I'm so fly) Feels like I'm takin off
I'm so high (I'm so high) Lookin for a shorty to break me off

[Outro: Slim]
I'm so fly, feels like I'm takin off I'm so high
Lookin for a shorty to break me off
