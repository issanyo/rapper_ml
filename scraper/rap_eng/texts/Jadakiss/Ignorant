[Intro: Sheek Louch]
Let's go, my nigga

[Chorus: Styles P & Sheek Louch]
Ya ignant
I know but fuck it though
I'm getting money and fuckin' hoes
What's your bucket list?
Gettin' money and fuckin' hoes
Ya Ignant
(Cool) but fuck it though
Ya ignant
Fuck it though (fuck it though)
I'm gettin' money and fuckin' hoes (Donnie!)
What's your bucket list?
Gettin' money and fuckin' hoes
Ya ignant
But fuck it though

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Ey Yo, like I'm still not gettin' money in my prime
Like I ain't get out my coupe all fresh and my bitch ain't a dime
Like these diamonds on my wrist ain't clear
Like I ain't next to the captain in first when I'm up in the air
Life this weed that I'm smokin' ain't kush
Like I ain't get on your song and give your little career a push
Like the fans don't go back to the back
Like everywhere we go, you can bet your ass is back
Like she ain't been on my dick from the jump
Got money, bought coke, had my shooter at the door with the pump
Like I don't walk around with that cig
Like I ain't from that era, like I ain't smoke blunts with B.I.G
Yea I'm ignorant I know, got money, fuck a hoe
When I'm done, kick her out, get in my sprinter van and go
We laugh at you, bro, your whole style is copycatted
Plus niggas that you run with ratted, nigga

[Chorus: Styles P & Sheek Louch]
Ya ignant
I know but fuck it though
I'm getting money and fuckin' hoes
What's your bucket list?
Gettin' money and fuckin' hoes
Ya Ignant
(Cool) but fuck it though
Ya ignant
Fuck it though (fuck it though)
I'm gettin' money and fuckin' hoes (Donnie!)
What's your bucket list?
Gettin' money and fuckin' hoes
Ya ignant
But fuck it though

[Verse 2: Styles P]
It's fuck it though, ask about it
Pop him in his head then laugh about it
Hit him with the full clip
Doc took half up out him
Other half is still in
If I ain't wanna' kill him, I get him a wheelchair
Fuck his girl in front of him, tell her I still care
I ain't got a bucket list, just a bucket hat
Fully loaded whip and a clip, yea fuck with that
I'll take work from the plug and give nothin' back
Hit him on the next shipment, that's what's up with that (D-Block)
They call me O-G-P, yeah, I'm grimey but get money like I'm O-D-B
Master ? on the mic, rushin' O.B.B
Countin' money you don't like it, you can blow me G
Got the pot in the backwoods
Got your girl givin' pot spelled backwards, get shot like actors

[Chorus: Styles P & Sheek Louch]
Ya ignant
I know but fuck it though
I'm getting money and fuckin' hoes
What's your bucket list?
Gettin' money and fuckin' hoes
Ya Ignant
(Cool) but fuck it though
Ya ignant
Fuck it though (fuck it though)
I'm gettin' money and fuckin' hoes (Donnie!)
What's your bucket list?
Gettin' money and fuckin' hoes
Ya ignant
But fuck it though

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Uh, yeah
Got more than enough money for a mansion stuffed in a vent
But everyone month I still choose to pay high ass rent
Cause I got dollars, don't mean that I got sense
The hood wet everybody up, but I got drenched
Like I still get the urge to sell a couple of dimes
A bunch of cars that I only drove a couple of times
Got the rims 'fore I got the insurance
When your ignant, it really ain't nothin' important, ain't worth it
I still put a shell in a coward
Pop the whole entire courtroom smellin' like sour
I-R-S ran down on me, knew I'd regret it
Had a Roley for a while 'fore I knew how to set it
It was the dream to get a mill' before I knew I could get it
When ya ignant, some people might think you're pathetic
Yeah, but fuck it though, I'm gettin' money and fuckin' hoes
And that's on my bucket-list, I'm out of here, enough of this

[Chorus: Styles P & Sheek Louch]
Ya ignant
I know but fuck it though
I'm getting money and fuckin' hoes
What's your bucket list?
Gettin' money and fuckin' hoes
Ya Ignant
(Cool) but fuck it though
Ya ignant
Fuck it though (fuck it though)
I'm gettin' money and fuckin' hoes (Donnie!)
What's your bucket list?
Gettin' money and fuckin' hoes
Ya ignant
But fuck it though
