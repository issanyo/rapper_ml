Cause ain't afraid to put 50 on your brains ho [4x]

[Verse 4]
Kiss is a hardcore nigga in general
Cause I slap you five and still put ten in you
And I'm still in the hood right there clocking em'
Shorty got the pack but I'm right there watching em'
Can't wait for one of ya'll faggot niggas to come through
So I can let the 40 cal stop a nigga oxygen

Burning up in a old jail the walls are sweatin
Find your way in the D-Block
Get some heat
[Hook 4]
Niggas gotta wet their mattress to get some sleep (3x)
One nigga violate they all could get it [everybody]
Burning up in a old jail the walls are sweatin
Find your way in the D-Block
Get some heat
Niggas gotta wet their mattress to get some sleep
