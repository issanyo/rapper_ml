(Styles P)
Hustle hard just to keep these streets locked
Bitch, I'ma D-Block gangster, the one off Keith lock
Ryde or die nigga that'll let that heat pop
I go through walls, and y'all just shit rock
You don't want your head in a bandage
I'm gunnin for bread, you don't wanna be part of the sandwich
I'm eating niggas food, thought they harder than can bitch
OG shit stomp out their bandanas
Pressure bust pipes, niggas asked if they fam lived
Niggas don't give a fuck when they bustin them hammers
I don't care if you dolo or with your set
I just know your head is comin off with your neck
You can catch me smoking a bag and I don't throw signs
But if, niggas cross the line they gettin chocked with their flags
And the hood know I'm on some bullshit
You don't tempt P to wild out and empty out no full clip
Lock that strap, two guns up
In my black fatigue suit with my white sox hat
I kill your whole block bitch my life's like that
The hardest in New York cuz I'm nice like that
I use my knuckles to break jaws, the hawk'll put a
Hole in your torso and you know what the eigth's for
Headshots only
It's far from the flinstones but you better believe it's bed rock homie

I don't give a fuck never have never will
My only concern is how to live it up
I don't give a fuck, y'all could all get it so
If it's going down know that I ain't givin up
I don't give a fuck, that's how the hood is
Ask me what's good I say two guns up
I don't give a fuck, shitty ass attitude
Mad drunk and high, comin through yo what up

(Sheek Louch)
I don't stop til the casket drop
Moms is pop, face not showin like a number that's blocked
Unavailable, run in your crib
We the new york pirates of the fuckin caribb', motherfucka
The barrel 'bout as long as a flute
Left hand on my wrist, the impact make it bend when I shoot
So I get low, one binocular, like the opera
Bitch is gettin hit unless the nigga lay on top of her
Real talk, my bars and my flow
Is the sharpest thing next to a hawk, get a fault
Eat with your nigga
Don't compete with your nigga
'cause it's love til the heat hit you nigga
Feel me, same jeans on for ten days
My re-up is heavy, your stash bout as light as a pen weighs
If you don't want your side out
Just stay home, when the real niggas ride out, hide out
'cause if I'm involved with it
I ain't comin to scrap
I'm pullin up with my shit on my lap
And I don't mean hands together when I say I'ma clap
Don't be fools my guns can close down schools
With enough blood to fill up pools
Ayo P, who you want to lay down
I can see these lil niggas movin up, like a ultrasound
When it pull off, I spin em around that's for you

I don't give a fuck never have never will
My only concern is how to live it up
I don't give a fuck, y'all could all get it so
If it's going down know that I ain't givin up
I don't give a fuck, that's how the hood is
Ask me what's good I say two guns up
I don't give a fuck, shitty ass attitude
Mad drunk and high, comin through yo what up

(Jadakiss)
I seen it I did it I claimed
Dreamt about it and became it
One blue steel, one stainless
I'ma D-block provider, although I do play a big part as a ryder
All my bullets move around when they inside ya
And niggas been foul since the days of Elijah
Yeah, the coke is garbage, the prices is unreal
Feds hittin niggas with flat bids for gun sales
It ain't a game neither, they givin RICO to the gang leaders
Tell you the truth to hit a bank sweeter
I got it mapped out
I got the game in a choke hold and I ain't lettin go til y'all tap out
And this here, is a bonus rap
Niggas is wired but everybody phone is tapped
Every word that come out your face will come out in the case
Slow a lotta niggas down, get 'em out of the race
It's either hold water or you holdin' a quarter
Takin' a chance, of never again holdin your daughter
Least you could do is send 'em a kite
Since it's Ramadan I only kill niggas at night
Either the barrel of the gun or the tip of the knife
Go head and beg for your life
So I can hurry up and ship you to Christ
Devoted, committed, by any means necessary
Do whatever for me and my niggas to get it

I don't give a fuck never have never will
My only concern is how to live it up
I don't give a fuck, y'all could all get it so
If it's going down know that I ain't givin up
I don't give a fuck, that's how the hood is
Ask me what's good I say two guns up
I don't give a fuck, shitty ass attitude
Mad drunk and high, comin through yo what up
