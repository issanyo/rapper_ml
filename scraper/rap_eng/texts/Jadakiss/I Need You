[Intro]
I need you, not me
It's not me, it's who got me
To hold me
To scold me
(That's some deep shit right there, Nino)
'Cause when I'm [?]
(Yonkers to Harlem)
(You a bad mother fucker)
You ready, [?]

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Growin' up with an older mental, your destiny really depends on what you been through
Wordplay, breath control, controllin' the tempo
In the hood it's like respect is your only credentials
Weed, liquor, and a gun are the only essentials
'Til you do somethin' dumb 'cause your homie convinced you
Put two behind the walls, they waitin' to [?] you
Plus you all washed up, they just waitin' to wrench you
Tryna stand up straight but the hatin' will bend you
In a different tax bracket, how can they offend you?
If everything they drop is ratchet, how can they continue?
Master of the ceremony, I'm ownin' the venue
The sword is might but I know you know what the pen do
Kinda hard to figure out but you know that it's simple
Catch a bullet in the head, that's a hole in the temple
This a fucked up game but it's so influential
Come across the same sample, its coincidental
I pay a flight, room and board with no incidentals

[Chorus: Jadakiss & Flowboy Vegas]
Tryna get it all right 'fore I leave you
This rap shit is my life and I need you
If I did it out of spite, I ain't need to
Words of advice, the team heeds you
Tryna get it all right 'fore I leave you
This rap shit is my life and I need you
I could feel it in the air when I breeze through
I don't really care what it leads to
Tryna get it all right 'fore I leave you
This rap shit is my life and I need you
Never bite that hand that'll feed you
Go livin' off the land if I need to
Tryna get it all right 'fore I leave you
This rap shit is my life and I need you

[Verse 2: Nino Man]
Uh, growin' up with a older mental
So official that I'mma pull in a roll of tissue
Mo' money, mo' problems, little niggas know the issues
The same happen to me, then the homies know to get you
So much sun, I'mma make it and you gon' watch me do it
It's just all about focus and you can't stop us doin' it
You can't stop, just like the cops can't stop the shootin'
Comin' at me is a no-no and I'm not refusin'
Been up and coming for a minute and I'm still leadin'
Y'all know I'm in and out the trap, I heard they still fiendin'
You was never ballin' with us, you was chair leadin'
Niggas think the trap is dead that shit is still breathin'
They say, "Nino Man, you act like you don't know nobody"
I said, "Nah, I just act like I don't own nobody"
They see the different color belts like I know Karate
Didn't greet me when I was broke, now they know somebody
They know before I ran the block, I controlled the lobby
And I already know what's up, don't gotta know to find me
Tryna be here for a while, not breeze through
This rap shit is my life and I need you

[Chorus: Jadakiss & Flowboy Vegas]
If I did it out of spite, I ain't need to
Words of advice, the team heeds you
Tryna get it all right 'fore I leave you
This rap shit is my life and I need you
I could feel it in the air when I breeze through
I don't really care what it leads to
Tryna get it all right 'fore I leave you
This rap shit is my life and I need you
Never bite that hand that'll feed you
Go livin' off the land if I need to
Tryna get it all right 'fore I leave you
This rap shit is my life and I need you

[Outro: Jadakiss]
What?
What?
