[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Ey

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
I told her roll one and light one for me
I told her roll one and light one for me
We smokin' La La La (ya)
We smokin' La La La (ya)
I told her roll one and light one for me (oh)
I told her roll one and light one for me
We smokin' La La La (lord)
La La La (lord)
Now I'm the ganja farmer
Yah, light up the bong
Light up the bong, now we all light up the bong, bong, bong (hey)
Weed be bong bong
Pass the chalice, we all light up the bong, bong, bong
Now I'm the ganja farmer (hey, hey)
Light up the bong
Light up the bong, we all light up the bong (hey, hey)
Weed be bong bong
Pass the chalice, we all light up the bong

[Verse 1: Jadakiss & N.O.R.E.]
If you having a weed convo, you better mention me
See me comin' out of the spot, or the dispensary
Me not being high, just doesn't make no sense to me
So me and my man chain-smoking with intensity
Uh, the censored me, never had sense in me
They said I should'a been dead or in the penitentiary
Before 21, now I'm 'bout to hit 40 then 41
I hope shorty done
Rollin' one and lightin' it, ain't no fighting it
A bunch of different strains on the table, all type of shit
Gucci clear glass frame, chillin' on the coach
Even rock the presidential, smokin' in the house
Robe is Versace, the slippers is Buscemi
If I told you what I spent on weed, you won't believe me (won't believe me)
Chanel scarfs and Chanel socks
C-N-N burn it down with The LOX

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
I told her roll one and light one for me
I told her roll one and light one for me
We smokin' La La La (ey)
We smokin' La La La (ey)
I told her roll one and light one for me (oh)
I told her roll one and light one for me
We smokin' La La La
La La La

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E. & Jadakiss]
Uh, Drink Champs roll the ??
Weed, liquor, ice and bogies are the ingredients
Yeah, hard headed with no obedience
Them niggas ain't loyal, so why you feedin 'em
I preceded 'em
Knew you never needed 'em
That OG kush got me feelin', like it's helium
Used to move work on bikes, I couldn't wheelie 'em
If I couldn't afford no P's, I'd be stealin' 'em
Old school Gazelle frames, Cartier champagne
That they send to the crib with mad envelopes (envelopes)
Good customer, appreciate ya ?? we been them folks
We don't associate with those that ain't in the smoke

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
I told her roll one and light one for me
I told her roll one and light one for me
We smoking La La La (ey)
La La La (ey)
I told her roll one and light one for me (oh)
I told her roll one and light one for me
We smokin' La La La (Ey)
La La La
Now I'm the ganja farmer
Yah, light up the bong
Light up the bong, now we all light up the bong, bong, bong (hey)
Weed be bong bong
Pass the chalice, we all light up the bong
Now I'm the ganja farmer (ohhh)
Light up the bong
Light up the bong, now we all light up the bong (hey, hey)
Weed be bong bong
Pass the chalice, we all light up the bong

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean & Jadakiss]
She makes my heart beat, La Da Da Da (La La La)
She makes my heart beat, La Da Da Da (La La La)
She takes my breath away (woah)
She takes my breath away
She makes my heart beat, La Da Da Da (La La La)
She makes my heart beat, La Da Da Da (La La La)
She takes my breath away
She takes my breath away (she takes my breath away La La)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss & N.O.R.E.]
La, la
Real talk, everything is better when you fly
If you ask me, everything is better when you high
In the crib, keep the good shit up in the cabinet
Come through I'll pull a rig out, that's if you dab it
Ayo real shit I ain't hit the wax in a month
But real shit, I only throw the wax in the blunt (in the blunt)
Either way you do it, regardless you gonna feel it
It don't matter to me as long as you inhale it

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
I told her roll one and light one for me
I told her roll one and light one for me
We smokin' La La La (ey)
La La La (ey)
I told her roll one and light one for me (oh)
I told her roll one and light one for me
We smokin' La La La (Ey)

[Spoken Word: N.O.R.E. & Crowd]
You don't have to, you don't have to be a part of the wave when you provide the water, goddamn
Woo
That's what I am
That was liquid, that was liquid
That's what I am, I'm the water I don't gotta follow the wave, I provide the water, ya know what I'm saying
That was, that was pretty good
And I wanted to, I wanted to break that barrier because I'm a hustler of all sorts
Yes
I've hustled, I've sold water to whales
Yes
I've sold tostones, you know, to people who sell plantanos
Yeah
