[Hook: GInuwine]
Ok we're all here together now
Big sister turn it out
Cause we're up in the club
Go to the bar like we wanna be
Toasting everything
Cause we're up in the club

[Verse 1: Ginuwine]
You know the game don't change
It's the same old same
And it's on when we're in the club
Homies come in packs, honeys come in stacks
Just to play here in the club
Everything's in here it's so unfair
How they do it when they up in the club
Just how I like it in here
I'm loving how they do it in here, the club

[Hook: Ginuwine]
Ok we're all here together now
Big sister turn it out
Cause we're up in the club
Go to the bar like we wanna be
Toast up on everything
And wearing ice because
It's packed in here (it's packed in here)
It's crunk in here (it's crunk in here)
These ladies poppin', they jumpin', made for something
You wanna take that in the club

{Verse 2: Ginuwine]
Bring your A game, don't bring your hate game
It's field day up in the club (the club)
Something like dancing, more like two romancing
They down, pour it up in the club (the club, the club)
Buy a round for the bar, put it down
Let it loose when you're up in the club
I'm digging how they do it up in here (uh-huh)
I'm feeling how they do it in here (uh-huh)
The club

[Hook: Ginuwine]
Ok we're all here together now

And wearing ice because
It's packed in here (it's packed in here)
It's crunk in here (it's crunk in here)
These ladies poppin', they jumpin', made for something
You wanna take that in the club

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I ain't a cake-o-holic but I'm a bread junkie
If it ain't [?] then it's the red moguls
Heavy ice got us looking like the matrix
All we need is a nice section and a waitress
Uh, tell her to bring two bottles of everything
It's jam-packed with models, hood rats, and everything
Nobody cuffin' they main thing
No thirty-eights, got the [?] it's the same thing
I spit the right venom for the tight denim
Black and white women, sundresses, light linen
DJ just threw "One More Chance" on
So I'ma roll something up then hit the dancefloor
Grown ups, occasionally I'm on them freaks
But it's really all the same I'm just on 'em cheeks
I let 'em both come so she don't get mad that she hittin'
Matter fact tell your friends I got [?]

It's crunk in here (it's crunk in here)

Yo, this is one to grow on right here
Y'all remember this one
The Club, Younglord
