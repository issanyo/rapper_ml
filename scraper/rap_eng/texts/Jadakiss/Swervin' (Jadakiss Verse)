(Jadakiss)
Fresh out of the barber chair looking like Mr. Clean
Yellow diamonds in the Roley looking like Mr. Reem
Solid gold Desert Eagle even my pistol clean
My everyday life is some shit you dream
Bentleys, bitches, bourbons, all that
That's the format, make floor mats
Whenever you pop a bottle drink all that
Get the hotel keys and where the mall at?
Kiss is in the town bad bitches is around
And we smokin' good, yeah baby it's a pound
They love em cause they see how he real
Stay fresher then the 3 dollar bill
Gotta be ill, patron shots gotta be chill
And if the problems can't be solved, they gotta be killed, yeah
If it's about money then it's urgent
But if not, then I'm swervin'
