When I first came in the game but thangs done changed

It's a stick up, so down on yo knees, cause I'm sicker
Don't disrepect it, you don't disrespect me nigga
I'm the one these niggas call on; when negotiations are halted
And the time comes for the beatin of the bosses
Make 'em an offer that can't refuse
They don't comply, well now I'm bout to stank these fools
Fool, I guess these niggas think they can't be moved
Realizie they don't scare niggas like they thank they do

If you f*ckin wit the 'Kiss, you ain't gon' breathe
The only time I lick in the air is New Year's Eve
Sonny from "Bronx Tale," you can't leave
Get kissed on yo' cheek then you meant to die
Cause when the gun start poppin then my temperature rise
You know my style; 20 niggas wit 40 Cals
Nine years ago you was hollerin shorty wild
Now I'm in the rap game twistin these honies out
Never left the crack game still on a money route
I run through the industry looking for enemies
Y'all niggas sound sick and Jada the remedy
Get shot in yo' eyes and mouth
Can't see can't talk when you f*ckin wit the heart of New York
And that's fouler that swallowin pork
And to f*ck wit the feds dog
You know I push the prowler to court
Toast on my lap, got the East Coast on my back, UH
How many times must I tell you motherf*ckers
We ain't industry niggas
We in-the-STREETS, niggas - you motherf*ckin right!
