[Hook: Lil' Ty]
Okay, that's twenty racks in my pocket
I'm riddin' 'round with that rocket
In this all black Maybach
And my young homie gon' pop it
I got racks all in my conscience
Money all in my mind
If I wasn't up in this booth
I'd be out commitin' some crimes
Okay, that's twenty racks in my pocket
I'm riddin' 'round with that rocket
In this all black Maybach
And my young homie gon' pop it
I got racks all in my conscience
Money all in my mind
If I wasn't up in this booth
I'd be out commitin' some crimes

[Verse 1: Lil' Ty]
Okay, I'm riddin' 'round in that Beamer
Quarter pound of that Keisha
[?] clip in that Neener
What you want no Aquafina
I spent a tray on my sneakers
[?] bump on my speakers
I ain't even signed yet I'm buzzin like a beeper
Got that big H in my waist line
Young shooters don't waste time
And they don't miss just like LeBron when he on that base line
I chase chicken don't chase dimes
No birthday but that cake mine
I got a bad chick if I don't hit she give me face time
And that toolie tucked in that Maybach
Watch rocket like ASAP
Talking all that money till I have my goony take that
Ya'll be acting funny knowing damn well that we stay strapped
And that wheel that I be driving look like it be on a race track
With them Lambo's and them 'Raris
Them dirt bikes and them Harly's
I'm riding round my hood probly faded off that molly
We scheming, we plotting
On anybody that got it
I'm riding round with that rocket and my youngin' gonna pop it

[Hook: 2x]
Okay, that's twenty racks in my pocket
I'm riddin' 'round with that rocket
In this all black Maybach
And my young homie gon' pop it
I got racks all in my conscience
Money all in my mind
If I wasn't up in this booth
I'd be out commitin' some crimes

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I got fifty racks in my cargos
That .40 filled with them hollows
From that pain, glory, that sorrow
Tell you that same story tomorrow
Got that work straight from Amigo
That Skydweller, that Kilo
Roll one up, sip that pinot
Everythings tranquilo
We don't hear or see no evil
Move them pills, weed and that diesel
Been so long, start to feel legal
Shit's so strong it's startin' to kill people
Broke niggas startin' to feel equal
You harmless, I'm lethal
Be honored if I meet you
My sponsors perico
All black when I creep through
All facts when I speak to
Riding round with that rocket and my young homie gon' heat you
He gon' do you dirty
Ima move these birdies
We just spend thirty, so now all I'm left with is

[Hook: 2x]
Okay, that's twenty racks in my pocket
I'm riddin' 'round with that rocket
In this all black Maybach
And my young homie gon' pop it
I got racks all in my conscience
Money all in my mind
If I wasn't up in this booth
I'd be out commitin' some crimes
