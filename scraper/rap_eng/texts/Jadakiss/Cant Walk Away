Jadakiss:

Heels with the denim, loafers with the linen
You've always been apart of me, I'm tired of pretending'
I just wanna finish off with a happy ending
I don't break easy, but you got me bending'
Analyze my vision
Walkin' away wouldn't be a wise decision
Realize it isn't, I never did doubt you
And Can't live without you, as far as love go
You was the one that showed me how to
Match made in heaven, relaxed in the seven
I would spend a hundid thousand rocks on the wedding'
Definition of loyal, so far from spoiled
Deserve the world, it's my job to get it for you
They say good things come if you wait for 'em
And dreams come true if you pray for''em
Guess I gotta try, and you only pretending'
It's just gonna make it tired

(Hook)
I'm so tired of pretending you are not a part of me
I can't walk away, I can't walk away
And I'm so tired of the dark days
I'm so tired of club nights
I can't walk away, I can't walk away from you

(Interlude)
And this time is gone wastin', and so much has gone on
I can't talk about it. And I'm so tired of these sad songs
Cause they won't leave me be, yes, I think about it
And I still feel pain, when you're feelin' pain (I do)
I still think about you runnin' in too late
You re my best friend, girl, you're the one inside if me
Forever

(Hook)
I'm so tired of pretending you are not a part of me
I can't walk away, I can't walk away
And I'm so tired of the dark days
I'm so tired of club nights
I can't walk away, I can't walk away from you

(Interlude)
Still my best friend, still my whole world, yes you are
Even though the clock s gone, time is speedin'
You're still very much my girl
I can't stop [?] my heart
Whatever's happened's been erased
Except what I can't change, I could, it's true
Because you're my best friend., girl
You walk beside me forever, forever, forever

(Hook)
I'm so tired of pretending you are not a part of me
I can't walk away, I can't walk away
And I'm so tired of the dark days
I'm so tired of club nights
I can't walk away, I can't walk away from you
