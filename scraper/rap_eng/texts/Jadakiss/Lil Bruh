Hold your head up lil' bruh
You're not dead lil' bruh
You are brown when this world is black and white lil' bruh
I know how it sounds low lil' bruh
But you'll be alright lil' bruh

At times I know life can seem miserable
But lil' bruh you got a lot of more living to do
You gotta go get it, they ain't gonna give it to you
Just watch what you say, and watch who you deliver it to
Put something away, cuz you'll never know when it rains
And you could never feel the love without knowing the pain
Bracelet and the pinky ring, go with the chain
These the different kind of jewels though, that go in your brain
Pray for your downfall, when you doing your thing
If something happens while you in charge then you was to blame
The less ? the better, stay fly get chedda'
Don't expect the V I or letter
When you get 'em never let up, when you fall get up
Wipe the tears off, get the blood and the sweat up
If you don't say nothing, can't be set up
Always stand tall, make sure you hold your head up

Hold your head lil' bruh (you don't stop)
You're not dead lil' bruh, no
You are brown when this world is black and white lil' bruh
(And you don't stop)
I know how it sounds lil' bruh
But you'll be alright lil' bruh

Aha, check me out
Yeah, ain't nobody gon' front you
There's money out here and you could get it if you want to
Or you can keep sitting around, saying what you're gonna do
If you don't pay attention, it's gonna come back to haunt you
Make saving one of your habits
Never keep the razors and plates under the cabinet
You can get further in life by using manners
Not only are these cellphones tapped they using scanners
Never use your own address, use your nana's
And if you ever have to pull it out, use your hammer
Yeah, white paper or dutch it
Ha, automatic or clutching
Once you put it away don't touch it
Let it come to you don't rush it
Accumulate more than enough shit
Then you get in the building and crush shit

Forget the ladies lil' bruh
(And you don't stop)
You're the greatest lil' bruh
You were made to amaze and bring change lil' bruh
It takes one to know one bruh
So here's one to grow one bruh
