Intro:
Good looking out poobs!
This is the kind of shit I need
Good looking out poobs!
This is the kind of shit I need
Good looking out poobs!
This is the kind of shit I need
You niggas will never be able to fuck with me
In a million years
In a thousand bars
Ahahahaaa
Beloved!
Yea niggas!

Verse 1:
When I black out, I don't even hear you clear
Im letting it go, and I don't even care who's there
1 out of 3
Either the dirt, better the chair
If you're lucky you might be brain dead for a year
Mastered every game
Hit every dame
Heron era, my man pops hit every vein
Wouldn't say I came up yet, I'm coming up
The money ain't in the diesel
The moneys in the cut
Fifth by the pelvis
Cause every week the block is somebody elses
Lil niggas is selfish
Im startin to get allergic to em, like shellfish
Try to talk to em and give em something, they helpless
Old school with the rebuilt engine
And they look like Levis but they rebuilt denim
Look a coward in the eye, you could see guilt in em
I done dealt with a snake, I could see real venom
And I ain't got time for the slammer
I ain't worried bout the 3 years, I'm worried bout my hammer
Just lost my gramma
Which means much quicker to blam ya
On or off camera
Like calisthenics, hit the tread for stamina
I'm a hustler, rapper, and gambler
Heavy bling
Top of the line everything
Name ring bells from group homes to every bing

Outro:
Yea nigga!
Shoutout to my niggas up north
I know that's how you wanted me to do it poobs
Hahaha
My niggas on parole violations
My nigga state
Niggas that just came home from doing five or more
Shit like that
We here baby
Right here
Getting this money
Case dismissed
