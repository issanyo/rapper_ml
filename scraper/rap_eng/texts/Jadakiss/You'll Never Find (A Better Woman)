[Verse 1: Teedra Moses]
Ooh, cat daddy...

Tell me what you know about (know about)
Tell me what you know about (you and me together)
Loving so sweet, no beef, just us two...
Tell me what you know about, tell me what you know about (love through any weather;)
Fuss, fight, put you out, take you back, 'cause, baby, it's a
(Ghetto love affair, ghetto love affair, ghetto love affair...)
Tell me what you know about your man huggin' blocks
All night, when he should be home huggin' you
Ooh... (Tell me if you know about a hustle can do)
To true love...

[Hook]
You'll never find a better woman or a bigger fool
Tell me what you know about breaking up and getting back together...
You'll never find a better woman or a bigger fool
Tell me what you know about, what you know about love... (Love...)

Ooh, cat daddy...

[Verse 2]
(But when the money and the fame came)
Oh, could it really ever change?
All you wanna do is grindâ€”why can't we spend a little time?
(You're unfaithful with my lovin')
Ooh, and this money don't mean nothin'
We keep going round and round, and baby, it's a
(Ghetto love affair, ghetto love affair, ghetto love affair...)
Tell me what you know about your man giving gifts
To compensate for all his shit! Ooh...
(Tell me if you what a hustle can do...)
I'm telling you... ooh, you'll never find...

[Hook]
You'll never find a better woman or a bigger fool
[Not no one like me...]
Tell me what you know about breaking up and getting back together... [You had it all in me...]
You'll never find a better woman or a bigger fool
Tell me what you know about, what you know about love... [Baby...] (Love...)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
You doing some mean frontin';
When I give you a token of my appreciation now, it don't mean nothin'
Can't call it hateful, it's ungrateful
Ma, I put you on the map, molded and shaped you
You supposed to thug it out, instead, you buggin' out
If that's what love's about, I ain't with that
If I ain't wanna be with you, I woulda just hit that
And never called back, that's my word, don't forget that
I had big plans for better places, better times
But you keep tellin' me what I'll never find
You know what? Nevermind
And it's always your fault, it's never mines, pick a better line
'Cause I don't know nothin' 'bout us breakin' up, gettin' back together again
Boo, never again
Maybe I shouldn't say never
But in due time, I may find something better...

[Hook]
You'll never find a better woman or a bigger fool
[You'll never find no one...]
Tell me what you know about breaking up and getting back together... ['Cause boy, you had my love...]
You'll never find a better woman or a bigger fool
[All my heart, all my love...]
Tell me what you know about, what you know about love... (Love...)

You'll never find a better woman or a bigger fool
(Oh, said you'll never find, you w-will never find)
Tell me what you know about breaking up and getting back together...
(Another woman like me, baby, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...)
You'll never find a better woman or a bigger fool
(No, no, no...)
Tell me what you know about, what you know about love... (Love...)
