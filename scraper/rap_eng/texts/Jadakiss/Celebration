[Intro]
Ah haaaa!
This the celebration after the fight
You know what I mean, Green Land, DJ Drama
The Champ is here part three (it's an invasion)
The bar is open, everybody in the sweet
Let's go

[Verse]
Nicki got em ready to take half the year off
Rihanna got the bitches shaving half their hair off (Riri)
Niggas is so wack, I took half the year off
Roll up the bamboo, pass the smen off
Dope is intended, take awhile to wear off
Keep straight full by the mild and veer off
Solid gold chandeliers, the champ is here
Big cups and liquor, cans of beer
I rep' Y/o hard, right up to the square
And I can pull a town card, right up to the lear
Hopping out all rugged, LV on the luggage (louie)
D block chain, you think I'm playing for the nuggets (nah)
Nah, I'mma boss son - I ain't Ty Lawson
And even though I'm on, I still got them things off son
All black attire, rapping fire
In they raps, just try reenact the wire
Ain't yo' fault the kids think you wack, they by us (they by us)
And these young cats easily adapt the liars (easily)
It's written on a blackboard
Death is a trip that we all have to pack for
Ain't no coming back ya'll
Still can't fuck wit the god, it's a fact ya'll
Flow is like Asthma, the way that I attack ya'll
Take ya heart away then rob the Yay
Do you like Frank did Arty Clay
Bought cribs in April, buying cars in May
Bullet wounds tomorrow, knife scars today
Game look easy but it's hard to play
Many niggas got a career, it's hard to say
How many win, when high demand - it's hard to lay
You don't want em to know you scared, it's hard to pray
Yea, now they calling you gay - it's The Champ (Pt. 3)
You can call it a tray, off this to NY all the way to the A
Then take it from Miami all the way to the Bay, hey
(Green Lantern)
