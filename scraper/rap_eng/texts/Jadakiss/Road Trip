[Intro: Nino Man]
I'm takin' a road trip
I'm takin' a road trip
I'm takin' a road trip
Uh

[Verse 1: Nino Man]
Window seat wit' a hunnid grams and an idea
New York place hot in a brown Kia
Church hittin' niggas wit' numbers but I don't care
Shit slow in the city, gotta supply it there
I'm tired of the toons in central bookings
They talkin' 'bout me but actin' like they ain't lookin'
Cops on me because they know what I'm pushin'
I'm movin' coke with no cut, they think I'm woofin'
Bought a shotty for two hunnid
I threw it under the goose like, "who frontin'?"
Anybody could get it, so who want it?
Y'all used to walk the walk now look at your crew runnin'
My niggas good in jail so I ain't worried
All they want is some three-ways and commissary
So I smoke weed and drink 'til my eyes is blurry
Screamin', "Free the homies!" Until then I'm ridin' dirty

[Chorus: Nino Man]
I'm takin' a road trip
Work, only tryna get more rich
Couple of pounds and four bricks
I ain't comin' back 'til I finish the whole shit
I'm takin' a road trip
I'm takin' a road trip
I'm takin' a road trip
I ain't comin' back 'til I finish the whole shit

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yeah, I'm takin' a road trip
I'ma stop in a South Philly and drop off like four bricks
Then I'm shootin' out to Beamore to get on my dope shit
In D.C. they might kill you over that po shit
But my niggas down in V.A.'ll give you the whole clip
And them crackas ain't playin', they'll finish the whole clique
Stop in N.C for a minute, finish the whole brick
'Cause my S.C niggas said they needed some more sniff, cool
Long as the energy is right, no bad dealings
Took me down a dirt road to a trailer that had millions
When I get to Atlanta, all I need is one push
One dope in the bluff, on the campus they want kush
Yeah, the prices are unbeatable
Even if you just read up, you still need a few
And I'm lettin' 'em go quick
I ain't goin' back home 'til I finish the whole shit

[Chorus: Nino Man]
I'm takin' a road trip
Work, only tryna get more rich
Couple of pounds and four bricks
I ain't comin' back 'til I finish the whole shit
I'm takin' a road trip
I'm takin' a road trip
I'm takin' a road trip
I ain't comin' back 'til I finish the whole shit
