Havoc: Yeah! Watup, son?
Styles: Havoc, watup nigga good lookin for the beat. I'mma talk shit over this one
Havoc: Told you I got you my nigga. But um, I want you to let these niggas
Know why you in that top 5
Styles: This is my livin nigga
Havoc: Why you that nigga
Styles: It feel good in here
Havoc: Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Second time around I'mma let the magic shoot
This time it's off the Havoc flute yeah
I'm a general and criminal yall fags salute
I'm in the streets while yall sweet like a bag of fruit
And I stick to my timberlands like I'm maganoo
Ya man lookin like he want it he can have it to
Try to tell these muthafuckas they should do as do does
I been smoking haze just as green as Gazoo was
Sorta like the city of Gods
We be screamin out "we gon' make it" but I pity the odds
I'm like knock out Ned when I pop out led
But I even been around to pass Biggie cigars
So I smoked wit a legend, if you took the oath then the ghost is ya bredrin
Blowin smoke in the seven
Or maybe it's the hooptie in these pisshole slums
Just tryna kick my piece off of kiko's drums
Ya know

[Hook]
Jadakiss: This is how we live
Styles: Smoking, drinking, hustling, thinking
Jadakiss: This is how we live
Styles: Drug spots, projects, Jail cell stinking
Jadakiss: This is how we live
Styles: Whole block run when they see cop lights blinking
Jadakiss: This is how we live
Styles: Benjamins, grants, Washingtons Lincolns

[Verse 2]
Die once you live twice die twice you live once
Get the shit confused so I'm puffin on the big blunts
Kick it wit the kid that be deep in the zone
It's the ghost, I got to go to sleep just to get home
I'm spiritually outta this world
Meet my lyrics on the darkside come back when the dutchie get twirled
I'm the alpha and omega of nice
I'm the messenger sent by the force at the head of the light
But satan's ridin my back in the dead of the night
I be doin some crazy shit for some bread and some ice
God I'm tryna focus with my third eye lens
I smoke haze to see my brother when he blow that wind
And I'm a grown man so I know my sins
And niggas don't get the picture so do Kodak win?
The shit'sover their head and under their nose
Not a star cause I'm a sun when it come to a flow
Ya Know

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm a rare individual
Represent my team till they put in me in the earth no air in my physical
I don't need to dream I live another life when I sleep it's so deep I'mma
Spare you the visual
Far from religious but my heir's name is biblical
Stay away from crabs they don't care cause they miserable
School lil niggas
You could by diamonds but I could play wit words that's a jewel lil nigga
Tongue sharp like a sword
I could get ya fam killed just off my word that's the proper Art of War
Stay wit the Parker and the Porsche
I don't trust a soul cause niggas threw rocks up at the Lord
The cash ain't right there the mask is right there
Niggas try P I'mma blast 'em right there
You don't want ya right ear next to ya Nike Airs
Said I'm from the darkside bringin the light here
Wha!

Styles: Second time around, you know what time it is. It's all lyrics over
Here nigga. Feel me nigga! And I'm in the hood for real. All day all night
Shit like that. Yo Hav once again good lookin out for the beat nigga. SP the
Ghost, ONE!
