[Click here to see what Jadakiss has to say about the making of “You Can See”]

[Intro]
You can see
You can see (We good)
You can see (matter fact we great)

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
One, one, one, one, one, one
Two, two, two, two, two
Three, three, three, three, three, three
Four, four, four, four, four, four
Top 5 DOA, niggas know he don’t play
I can sell a key a day, I guess it’s in my DNA
Comfortable with being at the top, that’s where he gon’ stay
Niggas usually stand there and shock when they see the K
I'm the general of the block, I'ma lead the way
Either way you can call me Paul, long as Peter pay
These niggas can fuck around with me? That'll be the day
.45 ACP I let 'em bleed away
Overpaid, underrated , deaf to the one's who hated
Big family of criminals, I'm the one who made it
Still get you situated, blue steel nickel-plated
We can clearly see what's going on here, articulate it, what?

[Chorus: Future]
And I don't and I don't (one) can I rock up me some coke
Can I buy another car and I don't have to pay a note
Can I pay my lawyer off and I don't have to go to court
I'ma smash a gang of bitches, gettin' money yeah I know
If you can see getting money what this nigga's about
If you can see these bitches and what they'll gone buy
If you can see the pain in these nigga's eyes
Then from the look of it nigga, you know what they about
If you can see these bitches and what they'll gone buy
If you can see getting money what this nigga's about
If you can see the pain in these nigga's eyes
Then from the look of it nigga, you know what they about

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
One, one, one, one, one, one
Two, two, two, two, two
Three three three three three three
Four four four four four four
Top 5 DOA, niggas know he don’t play
Get it over quick, I figure you gon' die either way
Out there on the strip, late night, sipping E&J
Breaking down on every sale we get, nigga me and K
They always gon' want the weed, they always gon' need the yay
Whoever don't need to bleed, definitely need to pray
All you niggas need to leave, all your bitches need to stay
Trying to alleviate the FBI and DEA
Whole scale full of work, wholesale on the Percs
Love me in the hood, plus I got the jails on alert
Still get you situated, blue steel nickel-plated
We can clearly see what's going on here, articulate it, what?

[Chorus: Future]
And I don't and (one) I don't can I rock up me some coke
Can I buy another car (one) and I don't have to pay a note
Can I pay my lawyer off (one) and I don't have to go to court
I'ma smash a gang of bitches, gettin' money yeah I know
If you can see getting money what this nigga's about
If you can see these bitches and what they'll gone buy
If you can see the pain in these nigga's eyes
Then from the look of it nigga, you know what they about
If you can see these bitches and what they'll gone buy
If you can see getting money what this nigga's about
If you can see the pain in these nigga's eyes
Then from the look of it nigga, you know what they about

[Outro: Jadakiss]
One, one, one, one, one, one
Two, two, two, two, two
Three three three three three three
Four four four four four four
