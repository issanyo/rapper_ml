(Jadakiss)
I does this forreal, it's only right that I claim this
If you talking bout paper dog then you talking my language
Still pushing them ranges, move that kush and them hazes
When it come to that white, yeah I'm still good with them razors
I don't fuck with them phones but I was good with them pagers
The Gucci hard bottoms always looked good with them blazers
In the hood I'm the saviour, I would never persuade ya'
All my bricks is from Cali, but my bitch's from Asia
All my niggas is eatin', even more on the weekend
Give or take a mil a month hypothetically speakin'
I used to throw my guns away but it's better to keep em
Cause when you play the game of the death, you never can cheat em
So I load it and pack it, already know that I stack it
And I'm dealing with a whole different financial bracket
Came in stingin' em, my buzz is forreal
Bizzz you playing around, I-I does this forreal
