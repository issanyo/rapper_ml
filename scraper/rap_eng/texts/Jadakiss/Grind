Look here, stay on yo grind
Everyday is a struggle, we all hustle & we grind

[Verse 1 - Jadakiss]
Do your history & find out
Kiss will be the last representative of authenticity
Officially, came in the game nice, initially
Money & respect over fame & publicity
Sicker than the sycamore tree burning piffery
Know they say "Ain't nothing sweeter than a victory"
Mob like I'm from the West side of Sicily
A true lyricist, I am the epitome
Typically speaking or just speaking typically
If rap is a cologne you niggas couldn’t get a whiff of me
I dare one of you chumps beg to differ me
Your forehead's where the back of the .45’s will be
This ain't an art or craft, this is a gift to me
I’ve run right through em, just send the list to me
Smoke like hickory, unsolved lyrical homocide is a mystery

[Hook]
Look here: stay on your grind
Everyday is a struggle, we all hustle and we grind
Lil bruh, get yours, come on stay on your grind
Only the strong survive you know we ride until we grind

[Verse 2 - Jadakiss]
In the hood, it’s a different kind of love
Cause if you create a spark you can get yourself a plug
Some niggas turn it down, but some niggas turn it up
Hit the highway and burn it up
Trunk full of white shit, dayshift, nightshift
And I’m dead wrong but my kids need the right shit
All that and them some
Get your hands on the work, then give your men some
Generate some income, save some, spend some, lose some, win some
Fuck it, rent something until the Benz come
Never associate with the frail dudes
Cause time is money and weight make the scale move
Take a great white shark to make a whale move
Separate all the marks from all the real dudes
Little something on your wrist to tell the time
But whatever you do, don’t ever get off your grind

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Jadakiss]
Probably sold every drug on the menu
Cause the thugging is in you but the struggle continues
Always bring it the same way, no matter the venue
And keep it brief with niggas cause they’ll try to spend you
The love goes by quick but the hurt's long
Rich niggas smile, broke niggas get their smirk on
And I’ll admit I gotta lot of shit to work on
But now I’m in the spot till the work's gone
