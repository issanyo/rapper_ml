[Sheek] (Jadakiss)
Fuckin wit the champion (you already know)
(J-A-D-A, kiss the game goodbye)
You fuckin wit the champion (you already know)

[Jadakiss]
Niggas know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
And I just wanna rock for a century
And then chase the book wit the documentry
If you can't do nothing other than flow
Life's a bitch like the mother from blow, lets go
Don't make me put your heart on your lap
Fuck ridin a beat nigga, I parallel park on a track
Hop out looking crispy, fresh and new
In a six but it's a BM and its Pepsi blue
And I don't know you
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Y'all ain't fuckin wit Jason
After I cash in there's really no justification
Of how I'm gon change tha game
So don't get outta line cause this little nine will change your frame
Motherfucka, aha

[Hook]
The champ is here
The champ is here

Y'all never gon touch the kid (kiss of death)
They gon have to get me at the top
Y'all never gon touch the kid (gangsta kiss)
No love this time nigga, kiss of death
Yo I ain't got time to be up here lyin to you
Just make sure y'all niggas feel what we tryin to do
If I fuck up then it's on me
Besides that it is what it is and that's what it just gon be
Blowin my purple, wish you would go in my circle
If you know my record is clean, you know I'mma merk you
I live like a warrior do
Without screamin true story, niggas know my story is true
The cribs, the cars, the jury, the spots I got
The money that pass my hand and the rocks I chop
The ammo, the artillery, the knifes I bought
Waking up sore the next day from fights I fought
In the hood cuz I fuck wit the thugz
Tryin to figure out, why the money never added up to the love
Gun in my waist, dutch in my hand
And I don't do a lot of talkin, I listen as much as I can

[Hook]
The champ is here (aha)
The champ is here (yea)
The champ is here (that's right)
The champ is here

[Sheek] (Jadakiss)
Fuckin wit the champion (you already know)
(J-A-D-A, kiss the game goodbye)
You fuckin wit the champion (you already know)

Y'all never gon touch the kid (kiss of death)
They gon have to get me at the top
Y'all never gon touch the kid (gangsta kiss)
No love this time nigga, (tell em kiss)
