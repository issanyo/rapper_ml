Intro - Jadakiss & (Woman))
(Jadakiss) Hahah (Sheek)
WHOOO!!! D-Block, Darkchild
Uh huh, yeah
Uh - yeah

(Verse - Jadakiss)
Yo, I'm just too much, I flow too sick
I be on top of the snare, all over the kick
Since a youngcat, I been one wit the drum tap
The purple start pushin my lungs back
Been there, done that
My words stick to you like thumb tacks
Pardon me, LOX hooked up wit Rodney
The Ferrari's teal, but the truck's mahogany
Hating, I can't get you bastards off me
Fresh like I just took the plastic off me
Me and streets is high school sweethearts
And I'm always in her so she can't divorce me
Can't see farther than Kiss, I'm like a father to this
Want ya go and cop your father to this
I possess the whole package - the girls, the thongs
And there's something about me the world just loves
D-Block bringing hell of a pain, 'Honey' tell em my name

(Chorus - Jadakiss & (Woman) (2x))
(J-A-D-A) I'm pulling it out, the guns'll pop
(J-A-D-A) I'm taking your money, the funeral stop
(J-A-D-A) The club'll band, the beat'll knock
(J-A-D-A) We just keep going, this shit don't stop

(Verse - Sheek Louch)
Sheek Louch get it popping, this shit don't stop
Got your boobs hitting, shaking in a Halter Top
Drizzling out, no shirt, burgandy drop
Chain's bigger than Chuck D and Flava's clock
Yeah boy, Sheek kinda hot these days
Hold the heat when I spit, need ten ice trays
D-Block what up? what's fucking wit that?
Got the Camp spitting heavy on this Jerkins track
Glock jerk him back, either that or the mac
I prefer chrome but take it if you got it in black
Thick shorty wanna hop on it
I tell her not here, but we could go inside the bathroom 'Honey
Let me give it to your straight, I ain't spending no money
We could drink till we pass out, make dicks and all that
I'm a gangster, I bet shorty crawl back
Got her job through a two way contact

(Chorus - Sheek Louch & (Woman) (2x))
(S-H-E-E-K) Pulling it out, the guns'll pop
(S-H-E-E-K) I'm taking your money, the funeral stop
(S-H-E-E-K) The club'll band, the beat will knock
(S-H-E-E-K) We just keep going, this shit don't stop

(Verse - Sheek Louch)
Hey yo it's Louchy baby, smoke screen in the Mercedes
Naw it's just weed, I'm fucking wit y'all
Oil slick, it's the juice that I throw out the back
But it's for real lil nigga if you hearing the clack
I'm bringing it back, you don't wanna jump to this
I'm David Blaine, it's magic how I gave it the Kiss
Letting it off, nigga like we hunting to diss (J-A-D-A)
Hey yo Kiss ((Jada:) what up Louch?) yo take it from there

(Verse - Jadakiss)
Raspy voice, flow of the year; It's the cue tip bars
They feel good when they go in your ear
Ti Gun, Peanut Punch your girl ain't ready (S-H-E-E-K)
(Sheek: Sheek Louch!) Jadakiss, the world ain't ready
We got haze in the air and we pouring the yac
Bout to get up on 'Honey' cause she throwing it back
And you know I keep the hawk on my neck, so don't violate
Cause I can't wait for it to go in your back, uh

(Chorus - Jadakiss & Sheek (Woman) (4x))
(J-A-D-A) I'm pulling it out, the guns'll pop
(S-H-E-E-K) I'm taking your money, the funeral stop
(J-A-D-A) The club'll band, the beat'll knock
(S-H-E-E-K) We just keep going, this shit don't stop
