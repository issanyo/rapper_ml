[Verse 1: Ransom]
It's hard to be a success if you never was
And I never was
The greatest thing I ever did was put on some leather gloves
And selling drugs for this ghetto love
But instead of love, I got the dead above looking down on this petty thug
Never budge is what I tell a judge
Slouchin' in my seat I think I said enough
Fuck 'em
Look in my face, my eyes red as blood, it's nothin'
Mr. Nickels ain't known for lettin' up, so cuff 'em
You think this champagne I'm spillin' is the reason I'm a villain
Believe that I'm appealing because the green is to the ceilin'
I'm fiendin' for a million
My champagne wishes and caviar dreams fulfillin'
I'm finna make a killin'
But still I'm by that building where these niggas try to kill 'em
Cause when he's not around is when his niggas never feel him
I know they sick of hearing Ran's name
He always talking about his damn pain, Shampain

[Hook: Mike Classic]
Take a little sip, all you really need is a bottle of the
(Champagne)
I don't know if you be drunk, or be high, if you low, all you really need is some
(Champagne)
Champagne, champagne, champagne
(Champagne)
All you really need is some, all you really need is some
(Champagne)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yea, all they heard was exhaust pipes
Being broke at 40 give a nigga the frostbites
Everybody just can't be living the boss life
If it's good, then cop the whole thing if it cost right
Breeze through, shoot past, shorties'll shoot fast
Bubbly, but it don't come in the flute glass
You smell it and it's already lit
Plus you controllin' the crowd so they know you legit
Name speak for itself so they know who you with
By the time you see the sparkles, you already hit
Real shit
Similar but it's different, drippin' instead of sippin'
For every bottle you pop there's a nigga slippin' the clip in
Still plottin', itchin', pill poppin', and sniffin'
Sucka nigga is just watchin' and wishin'
Sad part about it, it's a damn shame
Cause all he needs is a little bit of champagne

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
We like the trench coat mafia, fresh from Czechoslovakia
All the guns with alcohol and sake, huh
Criminals pass, who's show improves?, we up to date
No flakin' no moves, the niggas'll lake you in two
Pass by the Caesars in Vegas
My shooters is waiters
With magnums on strap, splittin' potatoes
Was a rough road I rose
Now we in roses froze
What it do cat daddy? I told you out the (?)
To live in luxury past the treys
Gold joints, we kings from violent plays
Cigars we wizards who only wear (?)
(?) straps on Champion hoods, this ours
A town where they live comfortable
We come through, frontin' through
We always in somethin' if somethin' new
Drinkin' at the stadium, philosophical theories
Thinkin' 'bout fixing the World Series
Here me?

[Outro: Ransom]
If the money and the fame don't take away the pain, it's a God damn shame
(Shampain)
We been workin' for these whips, tryin' to get a nice chain, now that's what I call slave
(Shampain)
It don't matter if you down or up, we pourin' bottles out in them hallways
(Shampain)
Livin' in this hell long enough will make you want to take away the Shampain
