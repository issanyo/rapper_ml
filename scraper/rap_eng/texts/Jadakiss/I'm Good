[Verse 1: Cito]
Yeah bandana on my snapback
Nikes on my feet, got a girl with a fat ass
Rolling on that Afghan Kush like I'm in Baghdad
Oh, that's your girlfriend? Well homie, I smashed that
Tap that, Tell them haters back, back
You can't touch this money ho, Guess I'm like in Sunny, Co
Spending all these hundreds though, Smoking on that fuckin O
Shorty know I turn it up, Something like that radio
Then I tell her burn it up, Ha, R. Kelly flow
You can find me at the top, That's where all the winners go
Oh, you a gold diggin ho? You can go dig a hole
I'm all about my money, yeah I'm all about my dough
Pink lemonade, everyday, when you see me
I pop up out of nowwhere like I'm 3-D
You can try man, but you can never be me
I blow you away, ha, Breezy

[Hook: Cito]
I'm good, fuck your feelings
Homie, I'm chilling, Ch Ch Chilling
Homie, I'm chilling, Ch Ch Chilling
Homie, I'm chilling, Ch Ch Chilling
I said I'm good, fuck your feelings
Homie, I'm chilling, Ch Ch Chilling
Homie, I'm chilling, Ch Ch Chilling
Homie, I'm chilling, Ch Ch Chilling

[Verse 2: Goldie]
I'm so smooth, I'm Tom Cruise in both shoes
I make moves like playing chess, I slow bruise
I'm so addicted to women, nigga I cannot lose
I love shitting on niggas, fuck it I'm so rude
Fuck, the way I'm living is so different than those dudes
I get my weather from old-timers, I'm old school
Louie flip flops, Automor tic tocs
Racks by the ziplock, tell me who was this hot?
A made nigga with made niggas I'm way richer
He can't shopping the corporate flyer than Blake, nigga
Whoever, don't matter, can get it whenever, however
Whenever is not just uncovered is the way that I put it together
Life of a superstar, now I'm living luxury
Niggas call me bro now, really they don't fuck with me
Bitches call me bro now, who really wanna fuck with me
That's why I'm always in the house and I don't want to company

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Homie I'm chilling, OG status
My pockets on swole and my bitches be the baddest
So raspy, you already know who that is
Came from the bottom of the hood, where the crack is
Sleeping on the king size Vera Wang mattress
Catch me coming out the Mandarin with an actress
Yeah I'm chilling, better getcha Nina
Or leave me with the money like Bobby Christina
I have your mom in the front row, in a black dress
Two mill cash any time all access
Told you I'm chilling, enough of the small talk
Sleeve rolled up, linen pants on the boardwalk
Watching a bracelet, straight from the district
Popping out the big boy toys, with a biscuit
Still down to earth though, keep it realistic
I already told you, but in case you missed it, Nigga I'm
