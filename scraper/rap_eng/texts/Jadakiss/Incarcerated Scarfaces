[Hook]
Now, yo, yo, what up, yo? Time is runnin' out
It's for real though, let's connect politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated Scarfaces

[Verse 1]
I felt related style and track millions
Nobody is safe, no man, woman, or children
Clips, already filled 'em, head-huntin' a billions
Stay up in the spot, the bread comes to the buildin'
Wanna be hot? The lead comes wit' the feelin'
Hustlin' and rappin', two things I'm skilled in
Uh, yeah, the choice is yours, baby, pick one
Broke elevators, turn the lights out, stick one
Tom Ford suit on in the White House, sick one
You ain't never had a brick, let alone flipped one
Know a couple off here and there 'til the piff come
Other end of the barrel, yeah, you the victim
Uh, good deed for four quarters
Bentley SUV is on order
I just threw my thing, I'm a king wit' a don aura
Shout to my UK fam, D-Block Europe
All my enemies, every nigga that got tore up
Y'all want to play games, I'm puttin' the high score up
This right here is that shit that they need more of
Runnin' your mouth to a stranger, you get caught up
Puttin' your life in danger, at least sort of
Classroom could never compare what the streets taught us
Don't just watch me, nigga, peep all us
Shallow minds usually drown in deep waters
I do it for the souls of all the deceased ballers
If you ain't never wit' us, how could you be for us?
How could somethin' that's so tarnished be flawless?
Told you, 'Life's a bitch', but she's gorgeous
Once you press play on her, you can't pause her
Rap's my house, tell these niggas to pay mortgage
Got work doin' the drought, it's no shortage
You know me, fuck the law, I'm lawless
