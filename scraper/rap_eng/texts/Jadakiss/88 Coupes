[French Montana]
Hah!
Cuz I don’t know what they totin
You niggas smokin that Lamar Odom
88 coupes like a car lot
I be 88 stories off the floor high
You need the Phantom Rolls
Flippin work, comin back like Derrick Rose
Don’t call me, I’mma call you
Sicily, bread, olive oil
Stop beggin nigga I don’t owe you
And once you cross the line nigga I don’t know you
Make about quarter mill a week
Man that closet like Fashion Week
Slingin drugs, dealers got the package
I still make Salah 5 times a day
Tryna send mama to Mecca
While a nigga snortin pound with the liquor
Man watch for the stick up, (prrrp)
G-O-D GOD flow
Don Juan de Marco, lot like car show
Feel for ya, nobody to kill for ya
Wanna tell ya story but God won’t bear with you
And nah, I ain’t tryna get bread wit you
So go and tell yo bitch to split the bill wit you
I'm countin commas, young die with honor
Turks and Caicos, still smoking marijuana
Corner block was ya boy office
Young boy shooter like Jamal Crawford
Bricks in the basement, givin niggas spaces
Clips in the Matrix, slid with the waitress
5 stars telly, said she 16
Now that’s R. Kelly, my niggas war ready
Gifted and cursed, next step could be the worse
Next coupe could be ya hearse
Man this shit hard when it hurt though
My niggas slingin hard in front of church doors
Man slingin hard was the first tour
Now it's H. Fraud on a surf board
I be clean as a whistle
Team is official
Black and white diamonds, all I need is a whistle

[Jadakiss]
My weed is the issue
Now may I proceed to kiss you?
They put you where both of yall single men
Home-made speaker outta the Pringle can
Can’t wait to do your thing again
When they mention your name the bells ring again
Gettin that cake, it cause friction
They love turn that hate to addiction
Mind thinker but echo prescriptions
Up in the presidential suite with a vixen
A lot of suckers in the bizz
Good die young, sucka niggas live
Quickest way to go, fuckin with the kids
He ain’t gon stop til you pluck him with the SIG
Lost 100 thou, fuckin with the Knicks
Flyin on a bruckner, bucket full of bricks
Last night club, fuck it, where the bitch
Cuz money in the field but I fuckin with the 6
Words of advice, run through the game
Niggas know the hood run through my veins
Real subtle with great poise
Pure bundles of straight boy
Smoke loud, make noise
Dream Team, Wraith Boys
RIP Darry D and Nutty aka Troy
