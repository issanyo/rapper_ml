[Chorus: Jadakiss & Styles P]
Rollin' with the homies, you already know
We gon get this weed bag, we gon let it blow
We gon get this alcohol, we gon let it flow
Problem with these fuck boys, we gon let it go
Rollin' with the homies, you already know
We gon get this weed bag, we gon let it blow
We gon get this alcohol, we gon let it flow
Problem with these fuck boys, we gon let it go

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Ogen pockets, chains all obnoxious
Classy wrist wear you know what the watch is
Know that I'm holdin', don't make me pop this
Kiss you need help? Chill Jada I got this
Bars is nuclear, flow is straight toxic
Need that new Lox, they waiting on my shit
Almost finished, I'm just doing the diagnostics
Matter of time 'fore we take the game hostage
Nobody can fuck with the Gods when we on our shit
Come to one of our shows, you can get in the mosh pit
Violate me and my fam, we can't squash it
If you don't believe me, my nigga, then just watch this

[Chorus: Jadakiss & Styles P]
Rollin' with the homies, you already know
We gon get this weed bag, we gon let it blow
We gon get this alcohol, we gon let it flow
Problem with these fuck boys, we gon let it go
Rollin' with the homies, you already know
We gon get this weed bag, we gon let it blow
We gon get this alcohol, we gon let it flow
Problem with these fuck boys, we gon let it go

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Rollin with the homies, you already know
Half an hour past, and we just lit a O
And I'm mad tired like we just did a show
It's a California strain that we don't get to grow
Saturday nights live like Joe Piscopo
White girls on white girls, go ahead and fist a ho
Pardon me that was a little raunchy
I'm a ghost for getting money haunts me
I'm O-dog you faggot-ass Chauncey
No disrespect to the gays
Rep of the sour, Kiss rep for haze
Louch got the yak, we can drink for ten days

[Chorus: Jadakiss & Styles P]
Rollin' with the homies, you already know
We gon get this weed bag, we gon let it blow
We gon get this alcohol, we gon let it flow
Problem with these fuck boys, we gon let it go
Rollin' with the homies, you already know
We gon get this weed bag, we gon let it blow
We gon get this alcohol, we gon let it flow
Problem with these fuck boys, we gon let it go

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
Hunnid thousand on the road, money transferring
Weed burning loud, bad bitches reoccurrin'
Last night is blurry
Ayo bring a Advil in hurry for my head and kick them bitches out the bed
If you don't like me, nigga, suck a dick
Fight who? Man these niggas with me shootin' quick
Where ya money, where ya jewels, where ya house at?
Ruth Chris? Nigga barely do the Outback (stop it)
Image me giving two fucks
These fake ass niggas ain't spending two bucks
If I every need a bail it ain't hard to tell, I'm Nas on these niggas
I been getting money but I stay in the cut, I'm like Pras on these niggas
New house, elevator and garage on these niggas
Robed like I'm 'bout to get massaged on these niggas
Watch TV not me or watch these triggas

[Chorus: Jadakiss & Styles P]
Rollin' with the homies, you already know
We gon get this weed bag, we gon let it blow
We gon get this alcohol, we gon let it flow
Problem with these fuck boys, we gon let it go
Rollin' with the homies, you already know
We gon get this weed bag, we gon let it blow
We gon get this alcohol, we gon let it flow
Problem with these fuck boys, we gon let it go
