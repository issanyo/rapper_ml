Yo It’s some legendary street shit going on right now ya know
Aye Kiss what's up my boy.. Mobb!

(HITTZ VERSE)

These niggas act like Robin Givens back
I’m just robbing giving back
Straight to my community plus Baby K need similac
I can’t even semi lack I know I’ma factor
O’s wit me like Toronto got the bundle in the raptor
Going through them books fo nem call it skipping chapters
Black man white collar crime they labeled me a cracker
Plata O Plomo get down or we blast em
His girl was there we left his bae behind like Tampa
Cops come through and interview give no answers
Or we coming back inside and killing you just like cancer
79th and Evans niggas dying over there doe
I’m divine I’ma pharaoh Glock 9 in the maro
I know I deserve it cause I been in this shit
Used to shop at Walmart now it’s Givenchy and shit
NY I’m with Kiss and he top 5
It’s just me and 4 guys yo main bitch she fina top 5

(Chorus x2)

We was starving shit I never could forget
Moving up it’s really levels in this shit
I gotta prosper I’m forever taking risks
Went from hood nigga to a hood legend in this bitch

(JADAKISS VERSE)

It seems like something bad happens every time I look up
We had a pot to piss in I was using that to cook up
Cause they ain’t want the ready rock it had to be shook up
A plug was hard to find niggas had to have a hook up
Never leave the drugs where the weapons at
FDB from the bottom still reppin that
A mistake ain’t a mistake learn from it that’s a lesson black
Money come money go nigga stop stressing that
Let my tombstone say that he tried his best
Remember we was starving now we got a private chef
From the Chinese bus to a private jet
From thinking we was live now we really live on set
They really saying what we really doing
It’s reallt levels to this shit and we really moving
It’s getting harder but we getting smarter
The funny thing about it we just getting started

(Chorus X2)
