[Intro]
(You've been away from me so long)
It cause I'm a memory
(I just don't think I can carry on so I start)
Pass me that bottle
(Drinking, drinking, drinking, drinking)
It's lit

[Jadakiss]
Your fault you was raised right but you rep wrong
The weed had seeds in it, the coke wasn't stepped on
Swept, mopped, and waxed, the floor that you slept on
Before you left the crib, you bundled up and kept your neck warm
Blackberry brandy, a stack for the family
Walk down to Hayston's, come back with a Camry (stolen)
Video games, they acting funny with the sticks
Galleria was poppin when lunch money was the shit
Garbage can with the fire on it
Cable box with the wire on it
Before the man on the horse, I had the tiger on it (tigre)
Caught fixing a bike, putting a tire on it (haha)
No divas just plain girls, heartbeat, Mary Jane girls
Rollers under the scarf with the same curls
Graduation and prom pictures with the same pearls
MB5's, Honda Elites, honor the street, A-Wah, your Honor was sweet
Yeah, everybody had long cash
Purple tops had it on smash
Can catch a knife wound or a long gash
South side, the Puerto Ricans form fast
Breakdancing, backspins, windmills
Do a background check, that nigga been ill
His ball game got a little nicer
Drop one of his passes he got a little hyper
Sisqo, old english, tryna bag this chick that don't know english
Niggas wasn't getting killed yet (nah)
The new jail wasn't built yet (nah)
Smoke dust back then, probably still wet
Years under my belt, I'm a real vet
V bombers, triple fats
Re-up on Broadway, triple that (triple)
KP, Jew mans, Willy Burger before the food stance
Suzuki's, Wranglers, Gucci links, bamboos and bangles
Everybody was official, not only do I love you I miss you, haha
Yeah
