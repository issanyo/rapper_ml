[Chorus: Barei]
Worry, worry, be-be-be again, again, again Again, again
Worry, worry, eh-eh-eh-eh
Be-be-be again, be-be-be again

[Verse 1: Barei]
Eo! I never said that I was sorry
I thought I didn't need no-no savior
No-no savior
I wanna tell you
Eo! Didn't wanna be your worry
You had to put up with my-my
Oh my-my behaviour

[Pre-Chorus: Barei]
Be-be-be-better show me!
You met me out of season!
Be-be-be-better show me!
To try it, to fix it, to start again!
Be-be-be-better show me!
For once i'm gonna listen
Be-be-be-better show me!
To do it, to feel it, I wanna learn!

[Chorus: Barei]
Worry, worry, be-be-be again, again, again Again, again
Worry, worry, eh-eh-eh-eh
Be-be-be again, be-be-be again
Worry, worry, be-be-be again, again, again Again, again
Worry, worry, eh-eh-eh-eh
Be-be-be again, be-be-be again

[Verse 2: Barei]
Eo! I never said you were you were my only I gotta know that you're not impervious When it's serious
You gotta know that
Eo! I never meant to drive you crazy
You had to put up my-my-my
Oh my-my-my mania

[Pre-Chorus: Barei]
Be-be-be-better show me!
You met me out of season!
Be-be-be-better show me!
To try it, to fix it, to start again!
Be-be-be-better show me!
For once i'm gonna listen
Be-be-be-better show me!
To do it, to feel it, I wanna learn!

[Verse 3: Porta]
Dame treinta segundos porque me sobra con eso
Para darte por lo menos diez razones de peso
Te arreglare si estas rota, sé que te vuelvo loca
Seré un idiota, si pero me muero por tus besos

[Verse 4: Porta]
Tu eres con la única que puedo ser yo
Y con quien mejor para compartir nuestras rarezas
Soy negativo y no sé decirte "No"
Seras un puzzle imcompleto si te falta este pieza

[Verse 5: Porta]
Mira por ti podría hacer cualquier locura
Agarrame de la mano yo te haré sentir segura
Vivíamos este amor puro si miedo ni censura
Te necesito como compañera de aventura

[Chorus: Barei]
Worry, worry, be-be-be again, again, again Again, again
Worry, worry, eh-eh-eh-eh
Be-be-be again, be-be-be again

[Bridge: Barei]
I hope you find another reason
That makes you wanna be by-by my side
I hope you have another reason
Just gimme a chance for today-ay-ay!
I hope you find another reason
Another reason, another reason
I hope you have another reason
Another reason, another reason

[Chorus: Barei]
Worry, worry, be-be-be again, again, again Again, again
Worry, worry, eh-eh-eh-eh
Be-be-be again, be-be-be again
Worry, worry, be-be-be again, again, again Again, again
Worry, worry, eh-eh-eh-eh
Be-be-be again, be-be-be again
