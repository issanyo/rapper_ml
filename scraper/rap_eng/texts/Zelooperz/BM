[intro]
Oh nah to the nahhhhh, Yeah, bitch! Turn the fuck up!
Bring that ass over here
[Verse 1]
She bounce it like she trying to get my dick hard
I'ma tear the pussy up like a bad report card
Watch the booty cheeks bombard
I think she's trying to get a nigga scarred
I'm scarred for life, I'm scarred for life
Rewind made a nigga look twice
I told that ho be cool all I got is one mic
But she gon fuck me right like she on her last life
Bouncin' on my dick like she trying break the condom
Think this bitch got a problem think she trying to be a mama
Timbo's and tube socks the only thing on me
Sock her in the mouth she call me Mick Foley
Sober ass niggas why y'all sippin' Sobe?
Got a zip of kush on me play her stationary Sony
Bitch I ain't your homie, better dome me like you know me
She only get the mattress, no matrimony
My name in they mouth, these hoes promote me
Make a bitch squala, make a ho O.D
She say I beat it up, like no nigga before me
She say fuck the alphabet and no nigga before Z

[Chorus]
Aw shit, aw shit
She bout to turn up on the dick
[x4]

I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy
I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy
I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy
I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy
I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy
I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy
I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy
I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy

[Verse 2]
Walk into a room, dick out boxers on
No more locked doors, got her open like pores
Only thing open after 12 is legs
Stop actin' dumb founded, bitch give me head
The ? shit when you smokin' on the regs
Cum stains, kush nuggets all in my bed
Duck, duck, goose pattin' on yo bitch head
Jooky than a bitch, pourin' liquor on that bitch head
She said she need a shower my shower don't work
If you ain't trynna get in that bitch and twerk
She said she need a shower my shower don't work
If you ain't trynna get in that bitch and twerk
Run trains on hoes I call first
Go berserk, beat it up till' I hear the birds chirp
Jooky than a bitch, squirtin' in yo bitch mouth
Styled surfed in her pussy then
I'm out

[Chorus]
Aw shit, aw shit
She bout to turn up on the dick
[x4]

I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy
I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy
I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy
I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy
I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy
I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy
I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy
I ain't trynna be yo baby daddy

[Outro]
I'm scarred for life, I'm scarred for life
