[Hook: ZelooperZ]
Work ethic like no other
I'm just grinding til the sum is up
Hope and pray I never plummet
I'm just tryna see the summit
Working everyday to sum it up
Nothing is never enough
Could have said I seen it coming
Patience is a virtue and I ain't ever rushing

[Verse: ZelooperZ]
You contest me I digest you
I can't get enough
Some shit I can't stomach but I
Still gotta feel my stomach
As a youngin' always taught to fend for my mother
Gotta hover up a notch [?]just to make some sense
If you hit licks don't leave your prints wash away with rinse
I'm trying to get it in mince
I see through it like a fence
My vision is blurred but won't hit the curb
Clear I got a glimpse
The things I accomplished will never amount to the way I feel
Just keepin' it real the gremlins got steal and they'll leave you still
If there's a will there's a way I make a way and sprint in a race
Aye, heed what I say
I ain't gonna complain
Can't crump on yo face
She shove me to the lace, I beat up the face
I beat up the case, she take me a place

[Hook: ZelooperZ]
Work ethic like no other
I'm just grinding til the sum is up
Hope and pray I never plummet
I'm just tryna see the summit
Working everyday to sum it up
Nothing is never
Could have said I seen it coming
Patience is a virtue and I ain't ever rushin
