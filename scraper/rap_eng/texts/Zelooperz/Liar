[Intro: ZelooperZ]
Alright...can we? Alright...yeah
Ahh, ahh
As amateurs, you failed to see
How to split a wig with a brush
Asked her, is it wet enough?
Pastor, I'm blessed as fuck

[Verse 1: ZelooperZ]
Split your wig with a brush, spit the color of your casket
Get used to your rations, any portion I imagine
I spit bars and you know who nasty? She so nasty
We both fuckin' like we both rabbits
Projectiles rappin', them bars is [chanted?]
Make em' do what I ask of, kush smoke a pack off
Tassel, hassle, take your hat off
'Cause we in the building, ain't no killing my arithmetic
I'm poppin' like I'm tickin'
Yours all up, mine still tickin'
Gettin' that ass, the plot thickens
She like that my cock thickens
All down her leg, let the cum trickle
It's goin' down like an icicle
She brought a bag of that white widow
And she might just want my bands
Gotta play my part
These girls is smart
Basically in my hands, hit her spot when she made that arc
Please leave my head
I raise the beat, you hot, my hot [?], these niggas is dead

[Pre-Chorus: ZelooperZ]
I got pain though, I can can bitch still
I got brushes dawgs, that come and split your wig
I know the law, but if it get there
Hairdo, I'm goin' off
Splittin' me that wig

[Chorus: ZelooperZ]
Mickey on my arm, liar
Acne on my bitch, liar
Steppin' on your lick, liar
Acne on my chest, liar
Where did you find this?, liar
All your raps ain't ad-mired
Pass the [?] I can't say, a liar
My raps like your job, fired
Bitch it's no days, off
Since I was eleven been laid, off
My flow is on, on
All of y'all is o-off
Smoke detecor, I go off
Bars spawning from no moi
That's why it's my whereabouts
