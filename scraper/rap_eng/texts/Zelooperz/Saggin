[Hook]
Life ain't what you make it
If you can't make it
Shake weightin' in the A.M.,
Wake up and smell the bacon

Is you reachin' for Satan?
Or is you ragin' for ya Savior?
Get dryed out Satan?
Or is ya gettin' saved by ya Savior?

[Verse 1]
I'm just posted for my propulsion
Mind mixed up in a commotion
Knew my time would come closer
Now the man has just spoken
Bitches say that they love me
I didn't notice when I was broker
Said she been all to my shows
Didn't notice when I was local
My vocals soulful, get your hoes' social
Remember when I was focused, hoping
Roach toastin', bunny ears pokin'
Kush Coma, now my pockets bulgin'
Know a lot, gotta lot to show you
So for now I got a clip for all you
Starin' hard, oh stop the hoein'
Flow hot like pots scoldin'
Now she wanna fuck, bitch you in luck 'cuz I got Trojans
If I lie I die, that's my slogan
History, I rewrote it
Your bitch next, she done broke it
When she text him, she just sold it
Told her to send me a fuckin' photo
I instantly just hold her
Bodybuilder, looking like a boulder
Titties saggin, they look older

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Ooh I gotta have it, Ooh I gotta have it
Ain't satisfied till my pockets start saggin'
