[Hook] x4
You too lame, you can't hang

[Bridge]
I do this for my family
So they can be safe where they lay

[Verse 1]
Hoes, I got them like Bruce Wayne
Get your bitch wet like a storm drain
She rode dick like a Hi-Lo
Leave her back wet like a Jorge
I don't give a fuck what the whores say
Bruiser Brigade, we change things
Time to bring them the pain
Right now with the new method mane
She start poppin', price change
Leaver her with that crushed face
That upper cut, that's busface
You must be musty
If you don't think that your shit stank
Bitch, ain't shit changed
All a nigga know is one name (Bruiser!)
All a nigga know is one lane
Came through in that one thing with my one thing
She sucked dick til the nut came
She swallowed like it was nothing
Gripping on her love handles
She ride dick with the no handles
Ball hard with the nohemys
Get close, then I'm done slammin'
Every song is your anthem
How High? It don't matter
Dealing with them family matters
Need to smoke some green matter
Malcolm X'ing these hoes out
I [?] from Mary Had her
If you ain't in the D
Bitch you're lost, you need to find your atlas

[Hook] x4
You too lame, you can't hang

[Bridge]
Moving at a fast pace
Bitch stay out my way

[Verse 2]
I was fucking hoes, done changed
Getting money like everyday
Andale, no tanste
Fuck that, let me do my thing
Fuck that, let me do my thing
Get the head first, then i boomerang
Her pussy game like dance moves
Bitch you need to step it up
You don't wanna mess with us
That's why I eat my vegetables
Smoke rappers like medical
Eat pussy like it was a egg roll
I am an animal
A bear, etcetera
No competitors, mess with us
Bruiser Brigade, bitch step it up
Step in the club and make rain
Step in your bitch and make wave
Broke ass niggas, I make change
Kushie off in my membrane
BITCH
BITCH, ain't shit changed
Like my diaper ain't get changed
I'm shitting all in this bitch mane

[Hook] x4
You too lame, you can't hang

[Bridge]
Moving at a fast pace
Bitch stay out my way
