[Chorus]
Girl you hella high
I can see it in your eyes
And you stuck in the clouds
Now it's time to dick yo ass down
Shawty said she only blow loud
She ain't gotta make a sound
Im bout to dick yo ass down girl
Im bout to dick yo ass down

Bad bitches and blunts
Ballin like the first of the month
?????????????
Sam I am
I unbuckle my belt
While she pickin' up ?
Get her wetter than Gilligan get on his Island
Got her sayin' my name like my first name Thyrain
Tell tell her pay attention like my rant
Blood stain green look like Heineken
How blow we gon get who knows
She said she never been this before, kudos
Old kush can never be too old
She already had 2 shots she like just two more
She said she got friends from ?
I hope these hoes ain't too old
She 19 but they 22 doe
And they say they brought a box full of Nuvo

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Oooh shit... what's in that bong?
Never mind that girl, what's in that thong?
She like damn, this my song, puffing like Sean Coombs
Slap the ass, hit like Toby but bitch I don't need no comb
She tell me where to go; orange cones
Everything loud; megaphone
Nigga calm down, lower your tone
Your weed is like your phone at work; silent mode
Shes twerking like she's tryna hurt me
Girl, contain that ass, like mercury
Shes hot, shot up on mercury
But shes still chillin' with a nigga currently
I make it rain, like limited edition currency
She a 0'10, go to Bowling Green
Fuck a pot of gold I'd rather have a pot of green
Don't know about me ask, yahoo, google, bing

[Chorus x2]
