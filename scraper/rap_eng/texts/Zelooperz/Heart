[Verse 1: ZelooperZ]
Work stretched on the stove
I'm working for goals
All a nigga really wrote is a [?]
Rules she follow those
She hop over obstacles
[Trottling?] on all fours
I got several flows
Calling on your hoe, she juggalo
Gave my balls to her, yeah she juggle those
High as hell, we won't reach the lows
Worry about these hoes you need to get your flow up (Get your flow up)
Running 'round with bitches tore up from the floor up (From the floor up)
A tear jug, you sick of these bitches (Sick of these bitches)
You ain't sick of those ditches
You in the britches

[Hook]
I GOT HEART (x3)
KICK YA ASS LIKE BRET HART
I GOT HEART (x3)
KICK YA ASS LIKE BRET HART

[Verse 2: Wiki]
Every day that I play, I play my part
Always short but every sport I played, I played with heart
Look into my eyes, you see that I got heart
Riverside park, park, now I'm not smart
But I'm sharp, in part cause deli was my Kwik-E-Mart
Playground was the city park
Weirdo hoes want Wiki's heart
And I love em back, basic bitches get me hot
I got cock and drive, let the hoe know I got heart

[Verse 3: ZelooperZ]
[?] as the under lay
Nah, boy we 'bout to spray
I whip that bitch today, I whip that bitch today
And I lay it out smooth, smooth like a fucking Gru
Gru how you wanna do, bitch do what you wanna do
She be soothe, put the dick in her she sue
Beat it up to high
Boy I am a [?] guy
Move your car, pull your car
Rip and fall, I'm at large

[Hook]
I GOT HEART (x3)
KICK ASS LIKE BRET HART
I GOT HEART (x3)
KICK ASS LIKE BRET HART
I GOT HEART (x3)
KICK ASS LIKE BRET HART
