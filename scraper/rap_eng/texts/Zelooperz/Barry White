[Intro]
It is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is

[Verse 1]
I was born in the abyss
Throw out the [?]
I ain't even had shit
Miles couldn't pay the rent
Eat big then we had the residents in
Bad bitch could throw us in [?]
Hangin' on my balls like a fuckin' ornament
At the same coordinates
You be payin' more horrors than the mortgage
Paint colors like Coogi
Bitch's on a date, she gon' give me that coochie
Get taut like [?]
I ain't no [?]

[Verse 2]
Cruisin' gorey
Bitch went down the wrong road like Dorothy
[?] smell horrid
Mama puttn' flowers on the grave, that's an orchid
Orthodox oracle, bitch I'm tryna paint this shit historical
[?] came out deported
Kill these niggas 'cause they ain't even boardin'

[Verse 3]
You suicidal, I'm a survivor
I'mma fix the pump like MacGyver
Make a bitch nigga perspire
Make a bitch nigga expire
Money on my dome just like hair follicles
I'mma run the hole like geronimo
I'mma run the hole like cardio
[?]

[Verse 4]
So high, know where to find me at
But I feel so low, hypochondriac
Gettin' grands in the a.m., that's a Pontiac
But I'm up late night like insomniac
They gon' hand me that pussy
They gon' hand me that
I'mma spin those racks, [?] fact
All day, say I'm feelin' like I'll take a nap
But I'm up last night like a momma at

[Verse 5]
You the only one I'm meant for
You the only one I stand for
Up late night, crescendo
Only one, let the [?] go
Only one, let the bong go
I wanna live in the smoke
Would you die for?
Bleed out
I'm so sore
Your heart hurts
That's a overload, that's a overdose
Your heart hurts
That's a overload, that's a overdose
Feel like I laid twice
Pterodactyls in my sky
Sit and watch me soar
Cause we up all night
Devils in disguise
Dancin' on the floor
Devils in the sky
They dancin' on the floor
Oh, you know I like your ensemble
But I know your love is a problem
Can't control it, I smoke it, explosive, yeah, yeah
You know I'm on it, I'm on it, I want it

[Outro]
Up late night, up late night
Can't get up like Barry White
