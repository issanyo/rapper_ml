[Hook]
Heir to the throne, I'm takin' this one home
Kushie to the fuckin' dome, I'm a fuckin' alien
Yo, your bitch got the thong, ha, I know she got it on

[Verse]
Girls pick me like dandelions
Find your girl, then pacify her
If it's loud, then pacify her
Hit it once like Olive Garden
Never went back, got the bread sticks
She like it rough like my environment
As long as she got all the green, everything gon' be alright
Half my hoes half-black, half my hoes half-white
Go hard or go home like you pissin' off that mad wife
Slangin' dick for the bread
No quilt, got that bagpipe
Dick meter, world taxi prices
Ball off the glass with the no license
Taxi driver with no license
Get twelve shots like Taxi, OG Jordans
Sayin' I know that you can't afford 'em
All sorts of whores in assortments
You ain't payin', then you can't touch 'em
Fake females, fake [?]
You stay boostin', bitch, I stay bustin'
I stay comin' crane style
Captain Morgan, one leg up, fuckin'
Ac got me sluggish like I'm wearing a cape drenched in some 'tussin
Bitches nothin'
Open the bag up, bitches fussin'
Tell 'em suck my dick and she does it
When she with me, your bitch trust me
Bitch, I need that money, honey
Or it's gon' get gully, gully
She toe-touchin', gimme Du-rag skully
Rubbin' on her hair, watch her do her dougie
Bitch, fuck with me
