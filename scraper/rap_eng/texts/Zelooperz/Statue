[Intro]
Oh nah to the nahh!!!

[Verse 1: ZelooperZ]
She all on my mahogany, smoking got it foggy
Leapin that froggy, Moncler look bossy
Sippin' tap not Vossy, Lost me bitch you caught me
Find me like faith in me, I begged 'em basically
Easy Bake Oven, taste buds be ruptured
Too hard to swallow, too tough to chew
I was told from your boo, bust that bitch like them moves
When in the booth I feel like I'm a statue of Zeus
Suck my dick like she ain't got teeth, play the game like a motif
Rollin' round in the streets, how will they remember me?
Smoke so much feel like I'm froze, I can't even feel my clothes
If you're slow can't be mad at you, I feel like a damn statue

[Hook]
Turn that bitch into a statue
Don't move statue
Get away statue
Rock shit, statue
Go hard, statue
I'm on statue
I need a statue
Hoes on my dick like bird shit on a statue
On a pedestal, statue
No hard, statue
After I'm gone I'ma have a statue
Thats real, not irrational

[Verse 2: Dopehead]
She suck dick, til her knees swole
Zooted fucking jooky bitches blowing weed smoke
That heater clap, then he froze
Niggas get foul, I'm shooting like freethrows
Shoot a rapper, No discussion
She topped me off I give that pussy a concussion
I body bag beats, somebody call the reverend in
Only in America, my bitch is not American
Bad bitches, pretty feet, fat ass, her throat deep
She ball hard, her hair long, she party hard, get no sleep
Beat her pussy, for an hour flat
Run her mouth, she can't get her tonsils back
Came in all black like Miss Mary Mack
Give me dope head bitch I don't know how to act
Fuck bitches ho, I'm 'bout gettin' paid
Rolling kush, pour a 4 up in my lemonade
My flow ugly like Flava Flav
Bullets dance on your roof like Juicy J

[Hook]
