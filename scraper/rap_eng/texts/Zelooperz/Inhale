She say I'm addicted she ain't wrong that's all I know
Why you want a dollar
All about profit
Making a deposit
Money stack counter
Count up till ya time up
Don't tell me that's all we know
Can't you get some water
You suffer from mirages
How it's hard to digest
I can't see when that's all we know
Now I rhyme for dimes, wasn't eating, Ramadan
You can hear it in my vocals but they'll tell you
They'll let you know
Grind like a grinder whip work in progress
On it like a prowler she on me creepy crawly
Drought what you on hit her with that wind up
Drop it like a pine cone
Spin her like a vinyl
Knock it out the lining
She'll tell you that's what she want
We can go where the wind don't blow
Came from the ground no holes
Came to bring hail no snow when will we stop heaven knows
I was raised by felons ain't no know ain't no telling
Get that pack then you sell it do not let it be a relic
My hand to hand exquisite
Wet her pussy, keep it misty
Hit her with that whiskey hit stick you get out what you put in
They say I'm frying my cells
Or hell or jail
My gremlins don't tell
My bitches whole sale
Fuck around and get you failed
Hammys a get you nailed
You don't get a chance to yell
My turtle don't come out its shell
She ugly as hell she can't hit the L
You frail run shit I don't leave no trail
In hell why we in hell
In hell while we inhale
In hell, why we in hell
In hell while we inhale
Pop the the kush out the bale
Bars start to propel
Nigga get it in the mail
Tryna get my check sale
Inhale why we in hell
I ain't even got to yell
Niggas been on the block
But I'm not gone fail
Fuck with me dog
I won't steer you wrong
We came from the ground like gravel
We spaced out like Tau
All it took was a while
Hoes on the hound wanna blow a nigga down
Like wind no cloud she pop that pussy make a negro proud
Get money I bounce
We ain't lounging in the lounge
Came in the game like whoosh
She don't give a fuck don't boost
Jumper cables give me a boost
Timber her get the boot
Army green on me like a troop
She seeking me like the truth
