[Intro: 2x]
Don't call me nigga
Got it bitch I'm a muthafuckin' coon
And ho, I ain't got nothin' to lose

[Verse]
Watch me hop out the whip
Whip up on yo' bitch
Then she whip out my dick
How many licks do I get
For sayin' I ain't Toby
None of you niggas really really know me, ugh
Ballin' like Obi Wan Kenobi
Pay me what you owe me
My floor catch her knees when she seen those double G's
All this schemin' going on, Ima need a referee
Want me to F E A T you gon' have to pay the fee

They used to hang us like dummies playing hangman
Years later never thought I'd see the same Klan
Black on white violence
Sad songs from violins
Searchin' for the finest
Got all my people dyin'
Small price that I paid for these Trues
Shit, I could buy a lot of niggas food
All this shit I been through, I deserve to do the fool
And when I make it to the top, Ima feed my niggas too

But til' then Ima kill it
Ballin' like I'm Krillin
?
Peter Piper picked a peppers
But I rocked rhymes
And when that Rolly is mine, bitch it is my time
Let's have moment silence for all these niggas dyin'
Show some love for all the mothers cryin'
Nigga searchin' for your dreams then i hope you find them
All these niggas lyin' in the Frankie Lymon

[Outro: 2x]
After I'm done with this tape
They gon' wanna kill me for the shit that I say
But they can't take away from the shit that I know
So I live fast, and watch 'em die slow
