[Hook]
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
Thank I ain't dead
I should be dead
Follow my motives I'm walking like dead
Stuck in my ways
I'm ending they days
I should be dead
I should be dead
But they ain't dead
Fuck with the case
Hammy to face
Fucking her face
Checking her pulse
She sound dead
In Heaven she should be there

[Verse 1]
I can't be wed
Can't loose my head
Can't feel my body
That Xan and that Molly
Shroom and the x
Henny and Jenny
Addie's and I ain't say lean
All of the the shit that I did
I should be dead
Functioning fiend
I should be dead
But before I lay to rest
Ima get bread
Ima get bread
Pass you instead
Right on the head
Trap out the collection
I should be fed
Mo money more problem
I should be dead
Like a brick to the head from Craig
I should be dead
I should be dead
Sick in the head
Sick in the head
Six to the head
Six to the head
Stick to the head
I should be dead
All this Kush just my oxygen
All these sins that I have seen
Ima need some tree treatment
Bullets done flew past me
I should be dead
Miss you mislead
Homie fell asleep at the red
We be rolling off them shits
Can't see signs, I should be dead

[Hook]
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
Thank I ain't dead
I should be fed
Follow my motives I'm walking like dead
Stuck in my ways
I'm ending they days
I should be dead
I should be dead
But they ain't dead
Fuck with the case
Hammy to face
Fucking her face
Checking her pulse
She sound dead
In Heaven she should be there

[Verse 2]
Quit fucking these hoes no condom raw sex
I should be dead but I wrap up instead
Had to stop at the pit stop
Thank god that I'm alive
I should be dead from the lookin my Eyes
Homeless plenty of time
Hungry as mice, I should be dead
Playing fam hoe gotta be dead
We gotta be head you
Off of them meds
We gotta be head you
Gotta pay the price
Ain't no price on no head
Just ask all my hoes
She got that body
Pray each day that I wake up
I stay off them benzos
I stay out my bed

[Hook]
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
I should be dead
Thank I ain't dead
I should be dead
Follow my motives I'm walking like dead
Stuck in my ways
I'm ending they days
I should be dead
I should be dead
But they ain't dead
Fuck with the case
Hammy to face
Fucking her face
Checking her pulse
She sound dead
In Heaven she should be there
