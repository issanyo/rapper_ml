With no dough, I lamp
I shine, no doors
I'm out, no doors
Don't slang, no birds
No dodos, the demons
Want my soul, if you stress
When you broke, you gon' stress
When you get on
Come on, tell that t-bitch, get on
My bitch bad like a old trans
Mission, you hear that
I'm next in a song
Straight line, think about jetting
Do or die, I don't know doe
Split her top back, sunroof
Slipping back down like I'm on a roof
Think about how I get around you

[Hook]
Mosquitoes, I lamp
I laugh, I lamp (Shine)
(Get out my face)
(I can't feel my face)

[Verse 2]
Gianni, Gianni, don't own no Versace
Get her wet like hydrants (Sprinkling!)
I know that she like it
My dick in her mouth like she knot untying (Popped her!)
Bitches fake since high school
Now they smile around me (Funny actin')
Basic-ass hoes ain't beatin' the case
You bad? Bitch, stop lyin' (They're lyin'!)
Mosquitoes, they flyin'
I lamp, I'm shinin'

[Verse 3]
Duck, duck, goin' through life bein' nice
Shit, get hot, you melt they on you
They get up in a trance
Frantic on they next approach
Cause they already know how they did you before
I know, I don't have no amnesia
Blow by my own leisure
Used to think I need to
'Til I change the set; it's Bruiser
This is just what I do, sir
Lifestyle, I'm Bruiser
You too nice to her
She run over you more
I never had shit
Shoppin' at the thrift
Give no fucks and that's literal
Leave these hoes in the minerals
Like leaves, mosquitoes get slapped
Leave these critters... t-t-too critical

[Hook]
