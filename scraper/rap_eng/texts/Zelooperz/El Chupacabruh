[Intro]

[Hook]
El Chupacabruh, where did you find him?
Smokin' that fungus and plenty is hotter
This ain't the type that you see all the time
Killing niggas ain't a regular life
El Chupacabruh, where did you find him?
Smokin' that fungus and plenty is hotter
This ain't the type that you see all the time
Killing niggas ain't a regular life

[Verse 1]
Looperz run up beat called El Chupacabruh
Smokin' that ganja, my beans mustard
They like the kind that be conscious, it just dawned on me
I can't die til they all do, it just dawned on me
All on point like archery, close my eyes niggas change like the fall leaves
Why seasonal? I'm stalling, to put a hole in your flow
Out of line then they all see, back to the dark scene
The gremlins is sparking, I feel be-longings
The streets is haunted, seen thoughts, she authorized me
To paint a vivid scenery, spooky as she wanted me
"Go to sleep girl," she boo-hooing on my shoulder, she all on me
She know what it is, I treat and I heat greenery

[Hook]
El Chupacabruh, where did you find him?
Smokin' that fungus and plenty is hotter
This ain't the type that you see all the time
Killing niggas ain't a regular life
El Chupacabruh, where did you find him?
Smokin' that fungus and plenty is hotter
This ain't the type that you see all the time
Killing niggas ain't a regular life

[Verse 2]
Now if you can't understand, you ain't resharded, bitch you stupid
You suck like pretty nipples and juicy coochies
Loopz I come back around seconds, seconds, Y'all the buffet
Ain't for the play play, slaying cats like chinks
Born to win? Fuck you mean? Scorn the ops they all t'd
Tops they all can do is hate on me
Blatantly make a disarray on faces they can't see
Too low key, Matrix, Matrix, Keanu Reeves
Dim the lights, she drunken like a monkey
Fuck with me cause I keep it funky

[Hook]
El Chupacabruh, where did you find him?
Smokin' that fungus and plenty is hotter
This ain't the type that you see all the time
Killing niggas ain't a regular life
El Chupacabruh, where did you find him?
Smokin' that fungus and plenty is hotter
This ain't the type that you see all the time
Killing niggas ain't a regular life
