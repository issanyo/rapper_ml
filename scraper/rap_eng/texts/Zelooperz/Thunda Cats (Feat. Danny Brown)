[Verse 1: Zelooperz]
You cuffing that ho
Please sir, release her
Three hun for feature
Me I don't need her
But it's cheaper to keep her
On my side like beeper
Red-headed like Reba
Basquiat like Reebok
She calls me, when she needs cock
When she see the cock, she wake up
Fucked up her make-up
Why you calling her to make up?
It's maybelline
Hit that bitch with the shoulder lean
Hit that bitch with with the catering
I'll bring that bitch my ding a ling
Put that bitch on the EBT
Scratch that, no DVD
You end up like Eazy E
My bad, that's not a joke
Smoking on dope, bonfire
Getting higher, Bon Iver
Smacked your bitch with my palm pilot
Now you looking lost like a fucking lighter (bitch)


[Hook]
Young made me unleash the beast
I got niggas on the west
I got niggas on the east
Know I'm on my rise
Like some fucking yeast
That look in her eyes
She want to come with me
Thunda cat (Hoooo!) (Repeated)
