Are you a man
Can you be romantic
Will you
Will you
Wake up fucking
Wake up fuck it, I'm so fucked up
Go to sleep working, I'm so worked up

It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic

When we wake up fucking, I'm so fucked up
Go sleep working, I'm so worked up

It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic

Fuck you bury that nigga
Mein lo can't wait for dinner, I can't dessert you
I can't desert you
I'ma choke you bitch
I'ma choke you bitch
Til there's no air left, only love for me left
You were the chef, fuck you a lot
Fuck you alive, fuck you alive
Fuck you a lie, why why why why
Wah wah wah wah, wah wah wah wah
Release the wires
Can't hold your strings
Smoke you to the face, swear you was laced
Ballin no crates
I can buy you some hate
Think it's there but it ain't
For me
Dead wrong, would you leave me
I love me, as much as you
Now leave me a blessing or two
Blessing on a bless me, she a blessing on blessing
Blessing on a blessing, blessing on a blessing
Girl I need you desperate, desperate
I can do whatever
To help you
Cut that beef off, deli
It been dealt with
I'm just fucked up
Off the lean, said I'm fucked up
I guess I fucked up
No get back said I'm fucked up
