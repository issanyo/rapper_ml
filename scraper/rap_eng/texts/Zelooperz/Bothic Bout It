[Verse 1: ZelooperZ]
Bitch you know it's Bothic
Yeah

She pop lock for Bothic
She pop lock for Bothic
Your bitch buying from Bothic
Your bitch buy from Bothic
I treat these hoes like I don't got no eyes or optics
Ray Charlie's angels lead me to the sky
I'm intergalactic
Stick to me like tar
I roll over you car
I got work in ah ah
I got worth some ah ah
I open up a jar jar
I make plays from afar
I got scars on my heart
I cannot be finessed
I learn from the best
I hit that block for the lean
Easy, I am a dream
I'm at 800 on E
Paint the scene through a stream
I'm vampiring
I'm a fiend
I paint the scene I make fifteen
I get this money get redeemed
Firing on my press
This kush ain't no steam
Pop a [?] bean
I woke up in my dreams
I can't be too depressed
I can't be too impressed
It's a xans for the strecha'
It's lean for the leverage

[Hook] x2
Bothic Bout It
Bothic Bout It
Bothic Bout It
Bothic Bout It
I've been whippin' into sonic
Hoe, I'm hotter than a comet

[Post-Hook]
Bitch I shine, fiber-optic
She gon' pop lock for Bothic
I see that pill then I pop it
I seen that shit then I copped it
Bitches always buying for Bothic
Ain't 'bout money I'm unconscious
Bitch I'm Bothic
Bitch I'm Bothic
Bitch I'm Bothic
Bitch I'm Bothic

[Verse 2]
Woooo Bothic rockin' Rick Owens and Hot Topic

Flow so wet I'm not responding
Fuck my old bitch
Bust that bitches spine
Getting money then I get it wide
Buffies on me ain't no eyes
Keep my name out your mouth

Free my nigga white Mike
They acting like he been indicted
Through my life with no lice
Then I threw on some ice
Bitches on me I'm too Bothic
Bitches know i get the play poppin'
Get the Gremlins around this

Smokin' zips, smell like Trix
Selling bitches just like a pimp

[Hook] x2
