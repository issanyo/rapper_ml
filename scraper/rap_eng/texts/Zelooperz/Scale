[Intro: ZelooperZ]
You ain't tryna fuck then we hold it hoe
You ain't tryna suck then we hold it hoe
Man I don't even wanna know dat hoe
Acting like she ain't get down before
Can't bullshit but you can hold this clip
Probably popping ho's, properly popping them
Can't you tell? You can tell
Give out what what I want I don't need no scale

[Hook x4]
Give out what I want I don't need no scale

[Verse 1: Zelooperz]
Bitch you ain't a Bruiser in my eye, can tell
Bitch you ain't a Bruiser and you kill yourself
Bullets kiss his head he ain't even yell
She'll sing well at you funeral
All I want is sales and no betrayals
You're in my lair, I'm out here
All this loud that I smoke, think I'm going deaf
All these drugs that I'm on, I'm feeling better

[Hook: ZelooperZ]
Give out what I want I do not need no scale (x3)
You ain't got no bag bitch, oh well

[Verse 2: ZelooperZ]
Know you want to kill, baby, I can tell
Trapped in my realm, trapping in my realm
I ain't never fell when yo eye ain't see
I can't ever tell, man my bitch so wet
She should have some scales
Pop so many pills, I can't feel myself
I get it in the mail
I get what I sell, put the paint on it, dry when I left
Stole so many hearts, committed many debts
Make sure I can't feel my death, I'm high every second
Why all this my medicine, ain't sin it's a blessing
Blunts is my soul essence
Peace is what I rest in
Get high, Lethal Weapon
Can't nobody arrest me
I sedated the session
She in love with the essence
I'm on the block with the bales, ain't no need for a scale
Whipping it well, off the Richter scale, hands full of hell, got em' helping themselves
Wetting them well, boy I'm high as hell

[Bridge: ZelooperZ]
I can't even explain how this feels
I can't even explain how high this feels
I can't even explain how this feel
I can't even explain how high this feels
How high this feels, how high this feels
I can't even explain how high this feels
I can't even explain how high this feels
I can't even explain how high this feels

[Hook: ZelooperZ]
Give out what I want I do not need no scale (x4)
Bitch I got skill, but don't need no scale
My bitch so wet, I think she need some scales
Give out what I want I do not need no scale (x3)
