[Intro]
I ain't got no iPhone, bitch don't even look this way cause I ain't got shit for you

[Hook]
Bad batches in my Blackberry
I don't even use my BBM
Hit your girl in her DM
Now she's comin' to see him

[Verse 1]
My phone got water damage
I can't 'fford no Instagram
Girl let me see your phone
Unlock this bitch ho, whats your PIN?
I log in, upload that art
Now I'm tryin to get on Ocean, upload the shark
Tryin' to get high, negro roll that bark
As the story begins, negro where do I start?
Hoes on my dick, where do I start?
I ain't got no whip, where do I park?
Niggas gettin' mad, say my music's too dark
Niggas gettin' mad when I'm making a mark
Yeah I know it, no [?]
Back in the day niggas used to roast me
Now I'm out makin' noises
Deep stroke your bitch, I'm 'bout to go in
Skinny negro in here, VIP
Sipping on a beer
Forty miles, I don't care
I'm 'bout to dip, no dip
BB feeling on my ears, cause they're big like my dick
No choice to put thumbs up like you got on some intenze

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Hey sista, soul sista
Hope you brought that dro wit' ya
Hes sista, soul sista
Hope you brought some doe wit' ya
Hey sista, soul sista
Hope you brought that... UGH
Damn... Man... come on would ya?
