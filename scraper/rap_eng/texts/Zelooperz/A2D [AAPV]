[Intro: Silas Green]
Alright, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Silas Green]
Incommunicado for the first 48
Not guilty, rhyme filthy
Cointel, Cointel, I'll be in the chateau
Blowin' Ls, throwin' elbows
In the polar vortex
Give 'em hell slow roasted
Tell 'em in the west coast posted, periscope focus
Papi chulo in the tuto, buenas noches
Black Moses, black roses
Blackjack, Kerouac, on a roll with the gold Vogues smokin'
Both doors open
Rear wheel motion
No doors on and
Woke up in the D with some death in my pocket
Teleport to Kim and face the Jay [?]
734, put a stock in it
Keep it vegan with the budget, how we chop spinach
Execute the plan, see the guac thicken
Top billin', fire women
Woke up in the Deuce with my mind on a mission
Fickle with the butane flowin' through my veins
Few years in the desert left stains on my brain
Brushin' in the devil like Liu Kang, Wu Tang
This is how I do with the new gang
Yo, yo, yo, yo
This is how I do with the new gang

[Chorus 1: Silas Green]
Woke up in the D with some death in my pocket
Woke up in the Deuce with my mind on a mission
Woke up in the D with some death in my pocket
Woke up in the Deuce with my mind on a mission

[Verse 2: ZelooperZ]
Why you wanna go and wish death upon me?
Made me walk around like I got a vest on me
Bitch, go ahead, put your test on me
Pull a hex on me, put a mess on me
Made me walk around like a clock on me
'Cause a bitch wanna tie like destiny
I'm just tryna paint out my destiny
Get A2 with a pack on me
Pocket the rocket, dressin' my pocket
In Germany with the rats on me
Came a long way from the DET
Bitch, I'm high like DTE
Niggas still eat on the EBT
But came along way from no water no heat
Ay, Zeus, hot six weeks
Workin' day and night just to make ends meet
I got a quest on me
Why you wanna go and wish death on me?
Death in my pocket get the best of me

[Chorus 2: Silas Green]
Woke up in the Deuce
Woke up, woke up in the Deuce
Woke up in the Deuce
Woke up, woke up in the Deuce
Woke up in the Deuce
Woke up, woke up in the Deuce
Woke up in the Deuce with my mind on a mission

[Verse 3: ZelooperZ]
Woke up in the Deuce with a deuce in that pack
I ain't tryna leave 'til the leaves all get back
Woke up in the Deuce with a bag full of xans
I bought all of these, I'll PayPal once again
Woke up in the Deuce with the dues in a mission
I'm just tryna leave but money my dilemma
Woke up in the Deuce with a plan to sell pack
I just changed my mind, I paint slabs, I paint slabs
Woke up in the D, I hear sirens, I hear shots
Everybody jealous, ain't no lover pull the plot
Brick through the window, let 'em burn the whole house down
Brick on me now, I done came up from the ground
Crock-pot stole, don't work, skin is hella cold
I stick to the cold, I keep my eyes open

[Chorus 2: Silas Green]
Woke up in the Deuce
Woke up, woke up in the Deuce
Woke up in the Deuce
Woke up, woke up in the Deuce
Woke up in the Deuce
Woke up, woke up in the Deuce
Woke up in the Deuce with my mind on a mission
