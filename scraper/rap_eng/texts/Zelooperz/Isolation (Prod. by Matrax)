[Intro]
It's over...

[Verse 1: Zelooperz]

Put my penis in your pie hole
'bout to go viral
Two bitches on my dick like them hoes 'bout to tightrope
Got these bitches stuck like they're sippin' on sizzurp
Eyes blurred like walkin to the store in a blizzard
Used to walk miles in a blizzard
Back of the [?] next to the engine
But the stench I leave on the track is horrendous
Like pig feet 10 feet away from the freezer
I give this one to forensic
Style oh so fucking ferocious
SOS Smokin', loco like a motive
Put that shit in motion
...Bitch! ... Bruiser Bitch!
Bitch!

[Verse 2: Zelooperz]
Fuck all the rumors, let my dick make a statement
Hood rat hater! Bitch catch the vapors
Niggas jackin' off they lines, master... baiter
Let the K's decay him, put his ass in labor
Young Negro, draw guns like bang
Aimed at your trachea, Transylvania
Hit you with that danger, ain't got time to hang out
Don't pretend you don't see me foolin' on you strangers, Yee ah
Ay lets play hang man! Bitch choose a letter
You can't spell what I'm thinking, then you gon' die guessin'
Bitch I brought the lessons and the blessings
Shootout like old westerns, I fall hard under pressure
I'm the coldest nigga out, I can't die now
Skinny nigga west side flow like West Nile
You Niggas need a fucking rest now
Time to lay that ass down, Chop it, Chop it down!

Bruiser! Oh Na Na!
