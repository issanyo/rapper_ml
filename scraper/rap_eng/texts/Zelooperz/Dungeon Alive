[Verse 1]
Breakin' down tales, see it through my eyes
You can't tell they shot the bus stop by my Junior High
Car always shot, catch the bus store hours
Fan blade stop spinnin', shit get hot
I walk the streets and see there's nobody that look nice
What I look like? I'm getting wreckless
Gremlin nights dark, gun shots pop like Sprite
Spirit here is Satan, Graphite
Unlimited lead, lead you into my life
All I do is write, all I see is wrong
I just try to write, squatting in a home
Squeeze through the aluminum back door
Hittin' licks as a kid, I learned it from my sight
Did what i did, I tried to forget
I almost forget, it disappeared
Cause my nephew cry at night, and I hear that shit all the way upstairs
All under one roof, like, how you live like this?
Water that drip, on molly that sip
I get zooted as I can get, all under one roof
Proof I'm here, on some real shit gotta get out of here

[Verse 2]
Young ass negro, never had much
Couldn't take shit, backed up
No paper towel, used the rag for my ass
But, I added all my luck, up
Cause the places I been, I could've been touched
Used to traffic, zips on the bus
From portfolios to AK47 bud, trying to make ends touch
Win us something we can be proud of
Words from the dust, dust on powder
How can a nothing-ass-nigga tell me how to live my life
If his fucked up? If your light so bright
Why your head fucked up? Thinking they can make something off your name
Niggas just trying to come up with some type of plot
Trying to get down, its my money now
How did you end up with more than me?
Y'all niggas slick scamming how you think you gon' fool me?
