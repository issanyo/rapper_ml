[Verse 1]
Zelooperrrrrz

Call my nigga Monte for the ganja
Light a nigga up like the candles on Kwanzaa
Pop a nigga like a fanta, rocket launcher
Leave a nigga dead in the street like Rwanda

[Hook]
Spit them rounds
Load them clips
Bag them trees
Blow those ?
Fuck dark skins I like the light ones
Fucked yo bitch she not the right one
X2
Man we dangerous
Yeah these niggas can't hang wit us
Won't bang wit us
X4

[Verse 2]
My niggas got K's like the jewelry store ho
And we got rounds like Merry-Go ho
Niggas got bands like Paramo'
Silly hoe, choppa make her dance like Go-Go
All these bimbos wanna slice like Kimbo
She think that she lucky make her drop it low like limbo
Ludicrous, the way we throw ?
Buy me clothes, that dont get you no hoes
Just catch em all
Yo bitch like a pokemon, she catchin balls
Yo bitch like a reggie blunt, I dont hit at all
Fuckin hoes like kush blunts I pass em to my dogs

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
See these bitches like condoms; on yo dick, or in yo pocket
I'm yellin' F these hoes, I feel like Mr. Crockett
Ramen noodle connoisseur, we are not ? (insane manure? lol)
You sent a bag in, obviously you are the user
Like Jennifer bringin' these grams home
Lemme start my campaign
Ain't no half steppin, I do it big call me Daddy Kane
Sonnin' niggas, before they daddy came
I know you weak cause in high school yo daddy was a lame
And thats how he met yo mama
That bitch look like Chewbacca
They say that I'm a legend cause I wield Smith & Wesson
Get it poppin like a beverage
Leave you lookin' like a leopard
Through salt, no pepper
That's why i'm high, like blood pressure

[Hook]
