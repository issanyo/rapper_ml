[Verse 1]
Pussy wet with my last I bet
And I get up in that bed and yell "quiet on the set"
If she ain't give a fuck, we wouldn't be fuckin'
Nothin' last forever, girl, this don't mean nothin'
Ima beat, then Ima eat it
Treat it like Ike did Tina
Leave and come back tomorrow
Girl yo body is somethin' I borrowed
Wet, now the bed wet
And I'm lookin' at the ceilin' just to see if it was leakin'
Everything but the kitchen sinkin'
I fell off the deep-end
I think my dick sinkin'

[Hook]
Oh I guess you think yo pussy is the best
Lo-key she got that fuckin wet wet
Oh I guess you think yo pussy is the best
Lo-key she got that fuckin' wet wet
Girl license to my temple, my temple
My temple, my temple girl
Welcome to my temple, my temple
My temple, my temple girl
Welcome to my temple

[Verse 2]
Legs up cause I can't afford a Lambo
Time to work my magic like Orlando
It's mandatory; morning, noon, and night
So when she say she can't stand me, she can't stand upright
Beat it all night, now she out like a light
Tell her I might bite, like Mike Ty
Sonnin' these for the D only
A nigga don't ball but play D only

[Hook]
