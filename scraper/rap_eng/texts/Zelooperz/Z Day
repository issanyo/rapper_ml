[Hook]
They be like
Boy you bout to get that check
(8x)

[Chorus]
I need like a dolla, dolla, dolla
I need like a dolla, dolla, dolla
I need like a dolla, dolla, dolla
I need like a dolla, dolla, dolla

[Verse 1]
You better get as much [?] let you
She’s on your head gremlins to the rescue
Dropped in the game whole bunch of lectures
Bitch you a rat the same pair of rescue
Bitch throw a neck and I just met you
Pussy getting wet I ain’t even touch you
Me want a bih better than everybody
Can’t see if your shades ain’t ultraviolet

[Verse 2]
But I’m bout to get that check
Then I’m bout to go get fresh
Then I’mma go get your bitch
That’s my bet (Hey)
Come here quick, to whip, to the crib
Gonna drive she rusty
Both ride she rockin’
Piledrive my dick
She like how we get to rest
After this, smokin me like toxic
I can’t chip can’t be upset
[?] them standards where they is
What they talkin about
Y’all niggas plurked out
I ain’t talking bout no foe
I ain’t speaking on no dro
I ain’t speaking on no hoes
If she got the dick than she know

[Hook]
They be like
Boy you bout to get that check
(8x)

[Chorus]
I need like a dolla, dolla, dolla
I need like a dolla, dolla, dolla
I need like a dolla, dolla, dolla
I need like a dolla, dolla, dolla
