[Verse 1]
I'm on the block with it
Direct high like Pac did it
She pop my pussy like a car with it
Free hell we on confidence
Niggas hate tell me stop shittin'
Bitches love it when I get it
Ball hard we are not dribbling
Point guard we still spendin'
My swag like a old man
Yeah I sold like four xans
I'm wet at first glance
When I'm Comcast bitch move back
I got it off pat pack
I'm the only one that can hold me back
If you're lookin' it for it we bussin' at it
Her head in my lap and we runnin' laps
Comcast if you sold your soul you can't buy it back
Leave the crib with my dick attached
Her ass gettin' fat then she brung it back
Cop the QP and smoke it back
Skin blank not a single tat
Steppin' out like a welcome mat
Smokin' on a baseball bat
Pockets fat cuz they spendin' racks
I'm a doctor she admitted that
Fix a heart with the hi-tech
It's the Players Club cuz we burnin' macs

Hook:

Bitch I make her pay like PayPal
Buy it off the plug on PayPal
Bitch I'm making plays on PayPal
Buy it off the plug on PayPal
Buy it off the plug on PayPal, buy off the plug on PayPal
Buy all the xans on PayPal
Bought it, I bought it on Paypal

[Verse 2]
This money obtain
She fuck me I'm drained
Bringin' the pain
You get your gang
Whippin' that paint
Causin' these strains
Bitch look at yo' face, get bust like a grape
Fuckin' again, stuck on my chain, continue my thing
Playin' these plays, Pullin' these strings, full of these days
I'm in my lane, my style a crane, my style a crane
Pickin' your face, what's the delay, what's the delay
She bringin' the fuzz, no trustin' the bitch
How are you lovin' and you bustin' that bitch
Like it's a zip, eatin' that dussy
Takin' a sip, mouth so drenched
Where's your bitch, where's your bitch she flyin' on my dick
Where's your bitch, where's your bitch she fallin' on my dick

[Hook]

[Outro]
[?] I'm safe now (ooh)
Hit her with the dick she brace now
Hit her with the kush, shitty face now
Smokin' the shit, I inflate now
MCM, I'm her crush now
Matrax got me off that bape now
Kobe-ly how I play now
Got my niggas thuggin' and [?] now (oooh)

Ooh!
