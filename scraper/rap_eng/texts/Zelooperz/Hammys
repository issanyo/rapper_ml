[Intro]
Oh nah to the nah

[Hook] x2
Hammys on his head, can't touch it though
Tryin' to stop me like the po po you know that's a no no
No no no no, you know thats a no no
Tryin' to stop me like the po po you know that's a no no
Hammys on his head, can't touch it though
Tryin' to stop me like the po po you know that's a no no
No no no no, you done lost your head

[Verse 1]
I can get paid without cockin' the K
World in my hands, I'm rockin' your fate
[?]
That's why niggas talking like something to say
[?]
Fucks too many whores, either or
I stuck my cock in the gate
She wet like the dock of the bay
Oil like the canvas, bangin' the paint
I'm so [?] can't comprehend game
Nothing to win, vitamin D
All that shit [?]
Pull up to my crib, she like "Damn that's crazy"
Bed's going crazy, she like "Damn that's squeaky"
Gave her that dick, she like "Damn that's brazy"
Hoes that know me know he real
And he ain't playing so its real
[?]
[?]
I'm just doing right now boy
Chasing hoes bro they came for immortal
And that's what I get and they dont get if that makes sense

[Hook] x2

[Verse:2]
Smoke 'em both out, how could you say that's a no no?
When a negro on his knuckles still ball hard on the court
Watch what I export, can't get into casinos
So don't play with money, rumors on hundred ten
Then they be comin' then, I be chillin' somewhere bitch
Black denim bitch, probably with your bitch
But she can't get this doe though
She gallop over here, just to gargle my kids
You better not reappear, I don't fuck with hoodrat hoes
Fucked her [?]
Kicked her to the curb again
No, no no
Oh nah to the nah
[?] my flow
Oh hell to the nah
[?]

[Hook] x2
