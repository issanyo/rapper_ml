[Intro: ZelooperZ]
This gon' get me a batch of bitches!

[Verse 1: ZelooperZ]
Not ballin', I'm failin', I'm stackin', I'm fallin'
Too many shots, I'm standin', I'm fallin'
Too many blunts, now ballin' I'm feelin'
Never too much, failin', I'm fallin'
Can't pay the bill, now I'm bailin'
Hold on, bruh, let me go and get this money
Can I give a shout out to my nigga Pac?
He let me stay at his crib, say I don't owe him nothin'
To be real, you wanna go to Brazil
Bruh let me kill the game, I'll fly to that bitch
Gimme that beat, I'mma body that bitch
Struggle life, said "bye" to that shit
Scramblin' for the change, tired of that shit
Young nigga sell whole lot of that shit
Moms cried when I sold that shit
Bet I ran out, now my pockets looking hit
Tryna buy some Raymond, lookin' for sanction
Lookin' under the couch, lookin' under the bed
That's how I knew I was 'bout my head
Nigga can't sleep and I need a new bed
Used to be locked, I don't need to smoke reg'
Now a nigga stressed out, pass that shit
Can't trust a bitch, yeah, fuck ya best friend
Got me in the game like "Nigga, what's next?"

[Hook: ZelooperZ] (x2)
Nigga, I'm fallin' (x4)
In love with the game, my life never be the same

[Verse 2: Dopehead]

I got a smart bitch, her butt is stupid thick
Cause she ball hard and claim Gucci clique
Cause she poppin' pussy, that jooky shit
I'm too legit, nigga, that uzi spit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
My nigga from the deuce-8 don't sell dope after nighttime
[?] on the pipeline, I ain't got no time to be writin' rhymes
Back seat of that two-door, them conflicts be crucial
If a nigga don't got my dough, you might be hit with a [?]
My mode survival, this Bruiser shit be tribal
Get close like [?], fucked up ya green like Geico
[?], I smoke dope [?]
No heat in that house, cold, to warm up, I had to use the stove
Nigga, I'm fallin', nigga, I'm fallin', nigga, I'm fallin', nigga, I'm fallin'
Fucked up on that game, [?] and Ciroc keep callin'
Now I'm ballin', now I'm ballin', now I'm ballin', now I'm ballin'
Yo' bitch all on my dick and, for sure, she keep on callin'
