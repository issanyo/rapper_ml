[Hook] x2
I'm so sad, wish I had a bag
World got me mad, wish I had some cash
Took some molly yesterday now today I'm so sad
So damn sad I don't even wanna rap

[Verse 1]
Wish I had some weed, but I've only got a wrap
So you know its a wrap, cause I ain't got no cash
Leave me alone, I'm so miserable
I'm grateful that I'm living and I ain't got no children
I'm so sad, leave me alone
Don't call my  phone, bitch I only want the dome
I'm so sad, I ain't got time to fuck you
Bitch you on my dick, bust a nut on them knuckles
Hoes come around when I'm so sad
Bitch, buy me a pack of that loud
I'm so sad, want some Chinese food right now
I'm so sad, bitch I don't like Laos

[Outro]
I ain't in the mood nigga
