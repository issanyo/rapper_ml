[Intro]
Yeah! Ah!
Bruiser, Bruiser, Bruiser, Bruiser, Bruiser
Style, bitch!

Coon in the- coon in the room, creator of our nation
Whole 'nother plateau, ho, I ain't playin'
Wait a cotton-pickin' minute, ho, I ain't stayin'
Goin' up on my level, I'll be back when I reckon
Tall negro got the caramel complexion
Bitches on me, doe,  woadies wanna get naked
Kushie got me jelly, she shakin' like I'm electric
That's my stove, my flow sent from the kitchen
My hands up, my heart beatin' intensive
Still some haters out here who doubtin' my existence
Tryin' to live my dreams, need that patience and persistence
Need that [?] on time, pussy, money, I'm winnin'
As long as you with the shits, I'm winnin'
Don't make a contribution
I ain't fuckin', [?]
Like her pussy gushy fuchsia
Rappin' 'bout bein' broke got me ballin' in the future
Fuck faded 'til you make it
Tell your story, already through it
We on that [?] shit
Wait a cotton-pickin' minute
Niggas actin' way different
That succotash, I ain't wit it
She wanna fuck me, I fuck her friend
I'm petty
Teach a bitch 'bout me in sixty seconds
Bars stuck in your head like woodpeckers peckin'
Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't gon' respect 'em
Hoes on my dick, I ain't gon' select 'em
Gettin' laid on my level
My plateau's elevated
Ain't no ladder for that, ain't no way gettin' up
Throw that loud in a blunt
Light it up, we gettin' affected
Like fat stay on my back
Bitches only come around when you 'bout to get the racks
Yo bitch loose like one out the pack
Bruiser [?], y'all niggas finna lose
Bitch, I'm [?] like I'm fuckin' with the [?]
Don't call me a negro
Just because my knees grow
Parlay with my people
Everybody know Ze cool
I'm missin' like sandals
She like what my hands do
She like what my dick do
My bars just confuse you
Bitch, I'm on, I been the proof
Bruiser high, you middle school
Flow 'cane like pimp [?]
Cuttin' up like Ginsu
Aim dot you like Hindus
Pac told me what a [?]
Make a negro think he strong, mane
I'm zoomin' in my zone, mane
Best kept secret like your age
My fans love me, they like to rage
Not enough time, got a lot to say
Goin' so hard, [?]
Hold up, bitch, I'm 'bout to pray
Then after that, I'ma grab the Bible
Flow sharp, [?]
You too suicidal
In that thing like her vagina
Clips'll make 'em back up like some minors
Y'all snitchin' like that Wire
I don't do it, indecisive
I'm that fuckin' negro
We in this bitch feelin' spiritual
I'm high as fuck off the Holy Ghost
I'm smokin', got your bitch fuckin' (You know it!)
