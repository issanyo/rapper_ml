[Verse 1]
I simulate a picture worth paintin'
First thing that comes to my mind is those Franklins
I could care less, frankly
If it ain't got shit to do with bank, B
I T C H now watch these hoes discriminate when they see them white faces
Man I think this bitch is racist
When she seen Ben Franklin that ho started gettin' naked
West side nigga, put yo hands up
Verbal Vomit nigga, put yo hands up
East side nigga, put yo hands up
If you black as fuck, put yo hands up
Fe, fi, fo, fum Zelooperz has begun
Zilluminati, mind, soul and body
Get 'em muddy like Miley Cyrus
You already know I'm with West Side bitch
VVE, that's my clique
Turn me up, this my shit
What you on? That's my dick
I'm so fuckin' racist all I do is throw white faces
All these whips and chains like a nigga still enslaved
Everybody know my name like it's cheers in this bitch
Pull out bottles of Moscato and have cheers in this bitch
Cause its a fuckin' celebration through all the years of enslavement we be still discriminatin'
So, I think, I think its our time to get racist
Pull out them Ben Franklins and we start the segregation

[Hook]
(2x)
Nappy as hell like Toby
I dare any of these hoes try to ho me
All I throw is white faces
You ain't know me, I'm quite racist
All I throw is white faces
You ain't know me, I'm quite racist

[Verse 2]
You can call me the Kentai Toby
I dare any of these hoes try to ho me
Nigga don't hate it, appreciate it
It's Zilluminati, fuck abbreviations
We in here, gettin' highly sedated
With yo bitch in here gettin' naked for faces
Nigga just face it
How you claim you hot bitch you have never met Satan
They say that we ignorant
They say we illiterate
But I see a lot of educated niggas in this bitch
She said how you gon' say niggas in the same sentence
I told her I though it was cool, ain't you heard Mel Gibson?
Fuck yo opinion, kill competition with penmanship
Don't time for discrimination too busy winnin' shit
Tommy Hil couldn't figure out why we winnin' races
Cause that nigga too busy at home bein' racist

[Hook]
