Killin' Bill collectors
Substitutionary atonement, that's what that means, no debt
So, Lord, put that to these student loans to

[Verse 1]
God camouflaged in these bars like cephalopods
But maybe not, cause we obviously reppin' the cause
To see the Gospel in everything
We checkin' the stars
Even creation in itself testifies there's a God
Now wait, hey what's that God's name?
It's Yeshua the Christ, the Living Water, One with the Father, the Way
In His ocean, man, we're coastin' and floatin' on one name
Inviting you to come to wade, Lebron James
In that Christ, we will unite like UK
Shining light bright in dark nights, no Bruce Wayne
Rep the West like a sunset
Flows like a sun dress
Rose after He died for what I hadn't done yet
Cast lots for His clothes
Clothed in a plum vest
Drove thorns through his dome
Blood to the Sons chest
Who is the King of Glory?
One guess
The Sabbath where the heathens and savages find rest

[Verse 2]
Now we ain't pushin' no foreign whips
No AMGs
We're coming to you in a bucket
Like KFC
Giving away all of our riches
Follow and trust He
Foolish Judas couldn't do it
Now it's 8 plus 3
There is no way, to have a good day
Without proclaiming the name
Of He who raised
You rockin' with the servant of the best
JGivens
Sidekick to the One in the air, Scott Pippen
Cast on Him every care and stop trippin'
Die to who you thought you was, and start living
Kingdom affiliates
Bumpin Scribbling Idiots
Saved by His grace
We couldn't master Leviticus
I started out with "Homie, just blaze and take a hit of this"
Now I'm on this "Give Him praise because He finished it"
Showing you this life's not ours, it's like we rented it
Numb 'til the Holy Ghost comes and now we feelin' it
Numb 'til the Holy Ghost comes and now we feelin' it
Regenerated life (feelin' it)

[Outro]
Let's go
(I want to try on my sea legs)
(But you ain't got no legs, Lieutenant Dan)
