[Intro: Kenan Thompson, Chance The Rapper]
Yeah, it's been a dope eight years but now we got one last Christmas with Barack Obama. So, if we going out, we going out with a bang

Let's get holly and jolly, shall we?

[Verse 1: Kenan Thompson, Chance The Rapper]
It's December 24th in the U.S.A
And the party's going down in a major way
The DJ is bumping, crazy snow outside
There's eggnog and chicken and turkey and fries
We still got Barack, so you know what that means
We shooting some hoops in high waist jeans
So 'tis the season, let's spread some cheer
It's the last Christmas with Barack still here

[Chorus: Kenan Thompson]
The last Christmas
Barack's still here

[Verse 2: Kenan Thompson, Chance The Rapper]
Hey, kids enjoy the presents while you can
'Cause next year you might get a bomb from Iran
Look man, we got birth control under the tree
And we're stuffing every stocking with legal weed
Hey Eric, Hey Mike, get married tonight
Real quick, let in every immigrant in sight
So go nuts before the North Pole disappears
This is the last Christmas before Trump next year

[Chorus: Kenan Thompson and Chance the Rapper]
The last Christmas
Barack's still here

[Bridge: Kenan Thompson, Chance The Rappe]
The last Christmas
Before Trump next year

Oh snap, even Jesus is getting down

Dang, Jesus, I didn't know you was a Democrat

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
This year I bought four Christmas trees
Stockpiled all the Home Alone DVDs
I got batteries, canned food, everything I need
There will probably never be another Christmas Eve
Been drinking eggnog like I don't care
I'm-a hurt myself before we lose ObamaCare
Say goodbye to Barack, say goodbye December
For a new holiday called Regular Winter

[Verse 4: Chance the Rapper, Darryl McDaniels]
Even Kanye is endorsing him
Got Obama back smoking Newports again
Left the cookies, last will and testament
For the first maybe last black president
I'm decked out in Santa gear from head to toe
Then I noticed Papa wasn't in his festive clothes
I said, 'Dad, what's wrong?'
And he said back, 'Never trust a white dude wearin' no red hat.'

[Chorus: Kenan Thompson, Chance The Rapper and Darryl McDaniels]
The last Christmas
Barack's still here
The last Christmas before Trump next year

[Verse 5: Leslie Jones]
Here I go, here I go, here I go again
Girls, what's my weakness? Joe Biden
He makes me feel funny in my Christmas wreath
With his aviator shades and his big ass teeth
Wanna take a freaky ride with Amtrak Joe
We could share ice cream under mistletoe
So Joe, snuggle up for a four year nap
And I'll tell you what I want while I sit on your lap

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
Jingle bell, Jingle bell, Jingle Barack
I do the Jingle Barack
Last Christmas with Obama
So hug your baby mama
And do the Jingle Barack

Jingle bell, Jingle bell, Jingle Barack
I do the Jingle Barack
Last Christmas with Obama
So hug your baby mama
Might be the very very last Christmas
