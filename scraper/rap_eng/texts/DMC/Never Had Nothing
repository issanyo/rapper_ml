[Mannie Fresh Talking]
Yo, This Fresh (echoes)
For you (echoes)
Bout to Freak, The Run D-M-C beat, Ya hoids?
Holla!

[Hook]
I ain't never had nothin (oh yeah), I'm tryna get somethin (believe that there)
And where they slang them thangs at, where yo ass duckin? (where you at nigga)
I ain't never had nothin (smell me bitch), I'm tryna get somethin
With them people on my back (holla nigga, nigga) but I gotta keep duckin
(Mannie Freezy!)
I ain't never had nothin, I'm tryna get somethin (let's, get feezy)
And where they slang them thangs at, where yo ass duckin?
(Suga Slim never love me like stone me boy motherfucker)
I ain't never had nothin, I'm tryna get somethin
With them people on my back but I gotta keep duckin

[Verse 1]
I started from a rock, then move to a chip
Nowadays I'm the Birdman bitch
I ain't never had nothin that share the same dish
We jumped off, we share the same clip
We share the same clothes, whole block wore out shit
Ghetto fab, that ghetto shit
It's that, ghetto map with ghetto tip
You never touch nothin that belong for you slick
We never had nothin so we run for this shit
Breakin-in houses and sellin these bricks, and these
Public houses, it's goverment bullshit
Four and a half tryna cut well for our shit
They tearin down our project(gun pops)bust-yo-clips
Look in ya eyes, see nothin but bitch, when you
Look in my eyes, see these hardlife shit
We ain't never had nothin, I don't stunt till I die bitch!

[Hook]
I ain't never had nothin, I'm tryna get somethin
And where they slang them thangs at, where yo ass duckin?
I ain't never had nothin, I'm tryna get somethin
With them people on my back (aye, aye, aye, aye) but I gotta keep duckin
I ain't never had nothin (alright), I'm tryna get somethin (beyotch!)
And where they sell them thangs at (oh yeah), where yo ass duckin?
(Holla atcha boy nigga!)
I ain't never had nothin, I'm tryna get somethin
With my people on my back but I gotta keep duckin
(Birdcall motherfucker!)

[Verse 2]
Nigga, we had tore down nights
Me and my brother had tore down bikes
Just his tore down life, nigga smoke and fight
Choke the pipe, youngstas bust for stripe
Ain't got new jewels, ain't got no life
Nigga, caught the blues when his part called lights
See I, been in yo shoes, lost memos on crews
And I, paid my deuce from scramblin blues
And I, laid my rules from cookin these fools
And these, fucked up time in seventy-two's
And I, learned to grind in eighty-two's
And I, learned to shine in ninety-two's
And I (gun pops), bust my nine in twenty-o-two
Now tell me what the fuck I'm suppose to do
I'mma ball like a dogg, so nigga fuck you!
You ever crossed my line, you know what I'mma do bitch

[Hook]
I ain't never had nothin, I'm tryna get somethin
And where they slang them thangs at, where yo ass duckin?
I ain't never had nothin, I'm tryna get somethin
With them people on my back but I gotta keep duckin
I ain't never had nothin (oh yeah), I'm tryna get somethin (beyotch!)
And where they slang them thangs at(holla atcha boy), where yo ass duckin?
(ha, it's our world baby, promise sucka)
I ain't never had nothin, I'm tryna get somethin
With them people on my back but I gotta keep duckin
(aye, aye)

[Verse 3]
We walk up to bread, no meat, marinade (Fuck!)
The whole block share a dozen our eggs
The whole hood had one nigga was craze
Mom smoked that shit she had to pay
Old folks know lil' one was bust his hage
Heroin, coke, and dope fuck with his head
Bout to flip the script come out today
Wild Tato, C-To, ball today
Hot cake see a fresh know how to play
Other side had my homie had to lay
Big Chief, real from the concrete streets
Nigga was on the labor and wanted to eat
Shit-a-never get better, love is merry
Tall house, survive and duck the inneries
Nice cars, clothes, pussy ho, money and fame
Every motherfucker in here know my name
I was born then live y'all niggas (believe that bitch!) banned in
That's why I stunt so fuckin much

[Hook]
I ain't never had nothin, I'm tryna get somethin
And where they slang them thangs at, where yo ass duckin?
I ain't never had nothin, I'm tryna get somethin
With them people on my back but I gotta keep duckin
I ain't never had nothin, I'm tryna get somethin
And where they slang them thangs at, where yo ass duckin?
I ain't never had nothin, I'm tryna get somethin
With them people on my back but I gotta keep duckin
