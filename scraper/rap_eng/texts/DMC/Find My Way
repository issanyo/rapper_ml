[DMC]
I'm just an MC, that's all that I be
I speak freely, clearly, you see
The people in the world, they all know me
So why sometimes I feel so lonely?
From a place and a time, that y'all forgot
But you wanna remember me cause my man got shot
Life is hard, so I gotta be strong
I gotta keep it right so I can't go wrong
I write rhymes, Gemini my sign
I got a nine I don't rhyme about mine
I spit, it's legit, never stopped by cops
Comin up with the hits when the records {*"DROP!*"}
My name's DMC, I said I'm great
I still say it now with no debate
Confuscious states, {*speech reversed*}
I gotta believe in somethin more than that
I gotta believe in somethin more than this
I gotta believe in somethin more than that
Fresh new kicks and the old black hat

[Chorus: DMC] + (Kid Rock)
I'm tryin to find my place in the sun
Never lived by the gun I never ran from one
I'm tryin to find my place in the sun
Never lived by the gun I never ran from one
(You know I'll find my way, find my way)
(Find my way, find my way in the sun)
(In the sun, in the sun, ey I'm gonna find my way)

[DMC]
The life that I live isn't make believe
You know who I am I wear it on my sleeve
Took a little trip down to Detroit
Whippin the whip down the strip like a A.J. Foyt
Makin hip-hop that's been my job
I know a kid that rocks and his name is Bob
It's a long race and I'm winnin son
Sippin on beers eatin veni-son
I can't take back, the things I've done
I know I'm fuckin up but I'm havin fun
I'm on the road, I'm gettin old
20 plus years so the story goes
Fly-ass pro, the {?} know
Who gets to stay, who gots to go
I gotta believe in somethin more than that
I gotta believe in somethin more than this
I gotta believe in somethin more than that
Like Johnny Cash I'm the man in black

[Chorus]

[DMC]
Yo yo, this one right here goes out to Jam Master Jay
And Joe C - we love you
Kid Rock, DMC
Y'all rest in peace

[Outro: Kid Rock]
You know I'll find my way, find my way
Find my way, find my way in the sun
In the sun, in the sun, ey I'm gonna find my way
Ey I'm gonna find my way, ey I'm gonna find my way
