This beat is my recital
I think it's very vital
To rock a rhyme
That's right on time
It's tricky tricky yo here we go

It's tricky to rock a rhyme
To rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky

It's tricky to rock a rhyme
To rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky

I met this little girlie her hair was kind of curly
Went to her house to bust her out I had to leave real early
These girls are really sleazy all they just say is please me
To rock a rhyme that's right on time I said it's not that easy

It's tricky to rock a rhyme
To rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky

It's tricky to rock a rhyme
To rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky

In New York the people talk and try to make us rhyme
They really hawk but we just walk because we have no time
And in the city it's a pity cause we just can't hide
Tinted windows don't mean nothin' they know who's inside

It's tricky to rock a rhyme
To rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky

It's tricky to rock a rhyme
To rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky

Huh

When I wake up people take up mostly all of my time
I'm not singin' phone keep ringin' so I make up a rhyme
I'm not braggin' people naggin' cause they think I'm a star
Always tearin' what I'm wearin' I think they're goin' too far
A girl name Tara follows Jared every gig we play
Evil dissed her then dismissed her and now she's jockin' Spanky
I ain't lyin' girls be cryin' cause I'm on T.V
They even bother my poor father cause he's down with me

It's tricky to rock a rhyme
To rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme
To rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky

We are not dumb we don't use drugs but you assume on your own
They offer coke and lots of dope but we just leave it alone
It's like that y'all y'all cause we don't quit
You keep on rock shot cause this is it
