[Chorus]
Ride on, ride on
Ride out, ride out
Let me tell you
What we all about, all about
It's ride on, ride on
It's ride out, ride out
From Hollywood
To the dirty south, dirty south

[Verse 1: Colt Ford]
I said, I need a beat, I wanna rock the band
So I went and got the king of raisin' hell
Put on the deep thinner two hundred and fifty
In a big black truck with the ten inch lift
Hopped out to New York, big city of dreams
With my cowboy boots gonna do my thing
It's a country boy with the king of rock
And y'all can't stop this real hip-hop
It's Colt and DMC and it's all good
He's rippin' house Queens I'm straight out the wood
I'm just camouflage wearin', Rayban starin'
In my cowboy hat and it's like that
I'm gonna fight the power, kill and devour
Any MC that wanna try me and D
Y'all better recognize the real ride on or ride out
Tell me how you feel

[Chorus]
Ride on, ride on
Ride out, ride out
Let me tell you
What we all about, all about
It's ride on, ride on
It's ride out, ride out
From New York City
To the dirty south, dirty south

[Verse 2: DMC]
I can down from Herman's from over Elle
That's where my name is known so well
I'm in a black pickup with a man named Colt
Y'all all know that I ain't no joke
He came from Georgia crossin' the border
Heard some of y'all were getting out-of-order
Tell the reporters gonna be a slaughter
Put away the wife and hide your daughter
On points like this it's unstoppable
Toppin' these two men is impossible
King DMC is remarkable
Tank killer Colt Ford gonna stop the bull
How he gonna stop it, with his gun
When he pull his gun out, there's nowhere to run
Like the Gatling gun works from the tongue
And every battle we been in we always won

[Chorus]
Ride on, ride on
Ride out, ride out
Let me tell you
What we all about, all about
It's ride on, ride on
It's ride out, ride out
From Hollis Queens
To the dirty south, dirty south

Ride on, ride on
Ride out, ride out
Let me tell you
What we all about, all about
It's ride on, ride on
It's ride out, ride out
From the east coast
To the west to the south
