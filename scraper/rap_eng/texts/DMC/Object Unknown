[Intro]
Yeah
Kool Keith
(DJ Spooky, ha ha)
This is a true story
I was walking down
One late night in the Bronx, Fordham Road
And I seen things
I mean it was ... real

[Verse 1]
Megasonic atomic
Utilize frequency
Inabilities format
You try to photograph
European human beings
Cruising in the BM drop-top, stop
And make the girls heads bop
From LA Express
Wearin' a fly suede dress
From the mothership
You agree when a fifth jet rockets computer
With money in my pockets
809
Scientist flags TV in a Rolex
Ro-ro-romance
Sony prepares Joe
We flow
Cruise speeds shift slow
Flying saucer
Pretend that I never saw ya (never saw ya)
Two people see me green
And then need a lawyer
UFOs
On Fordham Road can reload
I'm movin' travel
Heard my neon gavel

[Chorus]
Ahhh, man
So
I'm seein' objects
(What? Huh)
I'm seein' objects
(Seein' objects?)
I'm seein' objects
(What? Huh)
I'm seein' objects
I'm seein' objects

[Verse 2]
Two years ago
A friend of mine
Axed me to kick some elevation vine
So I'ma drop the sign for the knowledge today
The rhyme was high-tech and it went this way
Took a test at Howard University
And all these wackatees amazed by me
Till Keith took me outside in a Space Cadillac
Spooky drove off and we never came back
Spooky cut the record down to the bone
And now we're dropping signs on the microphone
Had me near to Uranus, Venus, Mars
Transvestites, gays in bars
Stars in drag, money in the bag
It's hard never been so far from home
Humans nowadays are being cloned
Before this bag blew up I was all alone
Now the space freaks, want to bone
Sniffin' coke and ecstacy
[?] 'shrooms
Next they recruitin' here skins in the red room
I'm from the Max Headroom
Generations
Perverts, queers, Pee-Wee Herman masturbation
Madison Square
Vicious clockin'
Me on stage in a Ferrari looking fly like Crockett
Crockett

[Verse 3]
Hold ya fire
That's what I told the FBI
So the other marshalls
The incubator baby cry
Federal investigation, at the gas station
You couldn't solve, figure the equation
Look around them little people standin' with some big heads
That was Captain Kirk walking with a black T-shirt
LAPD the nurse asked if my knee hurts
I was in pain, little marshalls tryna take my brain
Hospitals came, detectives wrote down my name
I was to blame, my life never been the same
A true story, I'll tell you if you never bore me
My classmate died, my other friend named Corey
Drinkin' 40's, he jumped out the project window
Stabbed himself wit a yellow number 2 pencil
(Oh Corey)

[Chorus]
I'm seein' objects
(What? Huh)
I'm seein' objects
I'm seein' objects
I'm seein' objects
(What? Seein' object? Huh)
I'm seein' objects
I'm seein' objects

[Verse 4]
I got a big Space Cadillac like a Seville
And written right on the side it says "Smokin' Grill"
So if ya see me pullin' bitches, step to the side
There ain't enough lunatic to y'all inside
It's like, first come
First crack on [?] writin' formulas, settin' cases
Laid out cold in a crackhead daze
I'm going through another phase
One of a kind for the people to like
Ever since Doctor Octogon [?] could fight
And all you don't stop the dude it just ain't right
'Cause you're fightin' all your life
Beatin' your meat and your wife
Hangin' out with that beast tryna clown
Son, you're wack, don't try to be down
You don't even know your English from your words to noun
You's an MC sucka and you're the clown
As if you see me rockin' steady
Bitches hop on my jock around the clock
If you let me see
I'm a fifty dolla bill, you sweatin' on my dill
So man, I [left, always left?] the ill, yo
So Kool Keith if you're ready
Hit the beat 'til ya palms are sweaty
Spendin' millions on porno
Pushin' x-rated tapes in the telly

[Chorus]
I'm seein' objects
Objects objects objects
I'm seein' objects
I'm seein' objects
Objects objects objects
I'm seein' objects

[Outro]
As I walk down the street
Seein' different things
Like 2 o'clock in the morning
There's another man across the street
He has a long coat on
But his face is green
I go tell the police
They look at me different
Nobody believe me
I go to tell the town
The sheriff
I'm seein' objects
I'm seein' objects
