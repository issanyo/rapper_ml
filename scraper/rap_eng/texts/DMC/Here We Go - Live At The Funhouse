[11. Run D.M.C - Here We Go - Live At The Funhouse]
TUTORIAL LA MIXTAPE

[Run-D.M.C.]
Here we go.. here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we here we here we go
D.M.C. and DJ Run, dum diddy-dum diddy-diddy-dum-dum
We're rockin on the mic and then you know where we’re from
Dum diddy-dum diddy-diddy-dum-dum
We hope y'all ready for the big beat drum
Drum diddy-drum diddy-diddy-drum-drum
So people in the place here the big beat come
Here it come, here it come, here it kiddi-come-come
Come on everybody let's all get down
What we have is a brand new sound
So nobody out there be misled
We make up all these rhymes inside our head
The other MC’s cannot compete
When we rap on the mic to this big beat
The beat is big it's kind of large
And when we're on the mic, WE'RE IN CHARGE!

[Run]
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that y’all (that y’all)
It's like that-a-tha-that, a-like that y’all (that y'all)
Cool chief rocker, I don't drink vodka
But keep a bag of cheeba inside my locker (HUH!)
Go to school everyday (HUH!)
Always time to get paid (HA HUH!)
Cause I'm rockin on the mic until the break of day

[D.M.C.]
And now the things I do make me a star
And you can be too if know who you are
Just put your mind to it, you’ll go real far
And the next thing you know you'll have a big car

[Run - overlaps]
A-liggy liggy liggy liggy liggy
Listen to the beat, here I say
Because it's not routine, it's the way I play (Hahh-AHH)
Spit come out my mouth all time of the day; a then ahh
And most the time, Jam Master Jay

[D.M.C.]
Hey they used to call me Easy Dee
Because I rapped on the mic so easily
But now they call me D.M.C
(HE'S) D.M.C. of the par-ty
The D's for doin it all of the time
M is for the rhymes, that are all mine
C's for cool cool as can be
(And why you wear those glasses?) So I can see!

[Run]
Rhymes so def, rhymes rhymes galore
Rhymes that you've never even heard before
Now if you say you heard my rhyme, we gonna have to fight
Cause I just made the motherfuckers up last night
Kick off your shoes, relax your feet
Party on down to the DJ Run beat
The beat to get you up and get you outta your seat
Make you boogie to this (party) cause you know it's unique
Wait a tiny minute, don't break on me
My rhymes come faster as the DJ Cheese
The DJ cuts the record for the valley below
Then I boogie your ass, til it's time to go
And when it's time to go GIRLS, takin you home
So straighten your dress up, bout your hair use a comb

[D.M.C.]
Well I'm the (microphone master, super rhyme maker) (x4)
