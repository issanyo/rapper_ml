RUN-D.M.C.!!

[Jam-Master Jay cuts and scratches]
"J-A-Y are the letters of his name"
"Cuttin and scratchin are the aspects of his game"
"Jam Master Jay"
"D.M.C."

[D.M.C.]
ONE TWO, ONE TWO
MIC CHECK, ONE TWO
TESTING ONE TWO IN THE PLACE TO BE...

"D.M.C."

ONE TWO, ONE TWO
MIC CHECK, ONE TWO
CAN I HAVE EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION PLEASE?

"D.M.C. and Jam-Master Jay"

[Jam Master Jay]
Everybody out there
Lemme hear you say YEAAAAAAH ("YEAAAAAH")
Say, HELL YEAH!! ("HELL YEAH!!")
Say, PARTY! ("PARTY!!")
C'mon PARTY! ("PARTY!!")
Lemme hear you say PARTY! ("PARTY!!")
Now SCREEEEAM (*crowd goes nuts*)
Now everybody...clap your hands...

[D.M.C.]
To the people in the back
Clap your hands, to the people in the front
Clap your hands, to the people on my left
Clap your hands, to the people on my right
Clap your hands, to the people in the middle
Clap your hands, to the people in the front
Clap your hands, lemme hear it

"Run-Run-Run-Run" "IT!"

"Run-Run-Run-Run" "IT!"

"Run-Run-Run-Run-Run" "IT!"

"Run-Run-Run-Run" "IT!"


"Run-Run-Run-Run"

[Run]
NOW IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME, FOR US TO SAY
THAT WE'RE...("Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay")

WE GOT, A WHOLE LOT OF ROCK GROUPS, BACKSTAGE TONIGHT
BUT DEE WANTS Y'ALL TO KNOW, ONE THING...

[D.M.C.]
I'm the king of ROCK, there is none HIGHER
Sucker MC's should call me SIRE
To burn my kingdom, you must use FIRE
I won't stop rockin' 'til I retire

[Run]
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, BUT GIVE US RESPECT!!

Yo Dee...do me a favor...Tell 'em Dee...

[D.M.C.]
Now just throw your hands in the sky
And wave 'em from side to side
And if you wanna have fun with Dee (AND RUN!)
Somebody say, ALRIGHT ("ALRIGHT!")
ALRIGHT ("ALRIGHT!")
Say HOOOOOOO!! ("HOOOOOO!!")
HOOOOOOO!! ("HOOOOOO!!")
One time...two time...aiyyo Run, let's get at 'em!

[Run]
They called us ill (we're gettin iller)
There's no (one chiller)
It's not (Michael) JACKSON, and this is not "Thriller"
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-D.M.C., like Kool from Kool and the Gang

[D.M.C.]
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
D.M.C. stands for DEVASTATING Mic Con-TROL
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his SOUL

[Run]
You know what? I think like a war or somethin...(WHY?)

[Run-D.M.C.]
'Cause we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through CEILINGS and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound, for blocks and blocks
For every living person, we're a ?purple treat?
It's me and D.M.C., Jay where's the BEAT?!

[Run]
They act like, they don't know over here, Dee
Can I tell y'all sumthin? (Yeah, what are we, Run?)

[Run-D.M.C.]
Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm D.M.C., I rock and roll, I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat, and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old SCHOOL!

[Run]
Y'know they act like, they don't wanna party, y'know wassup man?
(Wassup man?) Y'know somethin? (What they got?)

[Run-D.M.C.]
You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your MIND won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-D.M.C. rockin without a BAND!

[D.M.C.]
As it is plain to see, we have no band
Just Jam Master Jay (TELL 'EM DEE!)

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights

[Run]
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say PLEASE
(Cause when he jumps high) I'm pullin down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knockin down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-D.M.C.!!

[Run]
Yo Dee...(yeah wassup?)
Do you live out here? (Naw man, I'm from Hollis, Queens)
(As a matter of fact...) WHERE YOU FROM? (Yo..)

[D.M.C.]
I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that could never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, (shall set a trend)
Because a devastating rap (is what we send!)

[Jam Master Jay]
Now I want everybody to put their hands up like my man D.M.D

[Run]
Like +D.M.C.+ ({?})

[Run-D.M.C.]
C'mon! Put your hands in the air! Everywhere!

[Run]
Like this! Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the BEATLES!

[D.M.C.]
My name is Darryl (you can call him Dee)
You can call me Darryl Mac (or you can call him D.M.C.)
People always ask, ("D.M.C., what does it mean?")
D's for never Dirty, MC for Mostly Clean

[Run-D.M.C.]
But sometimes I tell 'em, when certain people ask
That D.M.C. means, that Darryl Makes Cash!

You know what I'm sayin? Twenties and tens...like what?

[Run-D.M.C.]
Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch, I'm D.M.C., I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your KNOT
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, It's Like THAT!
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back!
We're causin Hard Times, for Sucker MC's
Cause they don't make no songs like these
PERIOD!

[*crowd cheers*]
