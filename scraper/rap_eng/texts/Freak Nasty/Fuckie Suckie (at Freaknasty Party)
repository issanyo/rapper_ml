I'll see you there soon, you know, later

(It's that fuckie suckie!  At Freak Nasty party!
It's that fuckie suckie!)  {Come on and eat me baby!}
(It's that fuckie suckie!  At Freak Nasty party!
Check this out, hoe!)  It's that fu-ckie su-ckie!!

Verse 1
You see, we party every week at one of my cribs
Fuckin' hoes and barbecuin' up those pork and beef ribs
Women walkin' in and out, g-string down
I was in a pool, chillin', layin' these fuckin' lyrics down
It's all about havin' fun and lettin' down your hair
Bring your mama, bring your sister, bring your auntie; I don't care
'Cause my boys Los Caus, they servin' up like waiters
'Cause we don't have no time, for not one playa hater!

(It's that fuckie suckie!  At Freak Nasty party!
It's that fuckie suckie!)  Them bitches gettin' wild!
(It's that fuckie suckie!  At Freak Nasty party!
Check this out, hoe!)  It's that fu-ckie su-ckie!!

Verse 2:  Now if your girl, she's freakin'
We definitely, we speakin'
Now if, she's fuckin', you best to keep on truckin'
If you playa hate, you need to find another date
Or come join in, or stay standing at the gate
You knew she was a freak, that's why you got with her ass
If you thought you wasn't gettin' none you woulda let it pass
All I'm doin', player, is speakin' the truth
So don't get mad at me if somebody else is knockin' the boots!

(It's that fuckie suckie!  At Freak Nasty party!
It's that fuckie suckie!)  Hoes gettin' naked!
(It's that fuckie suckie!  At Freak Nasty party!
Check this out, hoe!)  It's that fu-ckie su-ckie!!

Verse 3
I didn't create this game; all I did was join the team
But comin' to one of my parties is the American dream
We got them hoes on niggas, them niggas on them hoes
Them hoes on them hoes 'cause everything goes
They buy, they try anything here
Come here, baby, let me whisper in your ear
You don't have to do nothin' that you don't wanna do
But before it's all over, I bet you will do it too

(It's that fuckie suckie!  At Freak Nasty party!
It's that fuckie suckie!)  We all fuckin' hoes!
(It's that fuckie suckie!  At Freak Nasty party!
Check this out, hoe!)  It's that fu-ckie su-ckie!!
