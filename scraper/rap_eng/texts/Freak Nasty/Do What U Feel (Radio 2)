Gonna keep it real.  I'm gonna do what I feel.  So this song goes out to
Everybody who likes to have fun, keepin' it real, so no matter what you
Do, and how you do it, just do what you feel
[Let's do it]

[Do what you feeeeeeel]  You can do it like that
[Do what you feeeeeeel]  From the front to the back
[Do what you feeeeeeel]  Or you can touch me right there
[Do what you feeeeeeel]  'Cause I don't really care

It's on, one more hit, baby
Lemme see you get low and dip, baby
Worlwide, young and old, snap them fingers, tap them toes
I'm back with another round, puttin' it down
Speakin' my mind and layin' it down
C'mon, do what you feel, girl, let loose for real, girl
Just move your body, rock your body
Don't you worry 'bout nobody
Y'all fellas go on and get up on it
'Cause you know she really want it
It's all about havin' fun, it's all about keepin' it real
It's all about havin' fun, keepin' it real, doin' what you feel!
[Let's do it]

[Do what you feeeeeeel]  If the feelin' is right
[Do what you feeeeeeel]  You can work it all night
[Do what you feeeeeeel]  You can do it from the side
[Do what you feeeeeeel]  Come on, baby, let's ride

Dance to the rhythm, da-dance to the beat now
Break it down, lemme see you get down now
Who said the party's over?  It just got started when I took over
Yeah, now wave your hands in the air
]From the left to the right like you don't care
C'mon, it's the one and only Freak, Nasty as I wanna be
Shake it up, baby, shake it down
I wanna see you shake it when I come to your town
On the floor and dip, honey, no need to trip, honey
It's all about havin' fun, it's all about keepin' it real
It's all about havin' fun, keepin' it real, doin' what you feel!
[Let's do it]

[Do what you feeeeeeel]  You can work that thang slow
[Do what you feeeeeeel]  You can work it down low
[Do what you feeeeeeel]  I like the way you move it fast
[Do what you feeeeeeel]  The way you shake that UHH!

Here we go, with Lil Mo, freakin' his hair from back do'
Yo, people in the front, yo, people in the back
Show me where your heart is at
Just do what you feel, don't be ashamed
'Cause bein' real is the name of the game
Do your thing, please yourself
'Cause it's hard pleasin' everybody else
First of all I'm gonna please me, the one and only Freak Nasty
I tell you now, I never sneak
'Cause ain't nothin' wrong with bein' a freak
And girls, that's me 'till the day I die
A straight up brother, but a lil' shy
It's all about havin' fun, keepin' it real, doin' what you feel, come on ...
[Let's do it]

[Do what you feeeeeeel]  I can do it like that
[Do what you feeeeeeel]  C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon now baby ...
[Do what you feeeeeeel]  From the front to the back
[Do what you feeeeeeel]  Do what you feel, girl ...

I'm on a roll, don't get behind; if you missed it, just press rewind
Do whatever, do what you're gonna do
Whatever it is, you gotta be true
Gotta be real and do what you feel, be king or queen of your own hill
I'm makin' music for everyone, so everybody can have a lil' fun
I'm comin' hard, I'm comin'n soft, girl
How you want it? 'Cause I'm 'bout to go off
It's gettin' heated, I'm about to sizzle
People to the right, even in the middle
People to the left, to the front, to the back
Do what you feel, yeah, I like it like that
Yeah, from me to you, just keep it real
(Too sweeeeeet!)  Y'all know the rest
[Let's do it]

[Do what you feeeeeeel]  I can work it nice and slow
[Do what you feeeeeeel]  I can work it down low
[Do what you feeeeeeel]  I can work that body fast
[Do what you feeeeeeel]  I like how you move that ask me no
Questions, I'ma tell you no lies!
