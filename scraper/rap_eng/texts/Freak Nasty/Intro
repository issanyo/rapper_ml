Peace, how you?
I ain't mean to be late, it was my night to watch my little girl
It's chilly out here
What happened, you crying?
Y'all got into it again, huh?
See you gotta let em know, from the jump, I don't care who they are, or who they with
Yeah, I know they know we talking
Why don't they just leave us alone?
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us can love each other
Come on, stop cryin' now
Oh, there's something I gotta tell you, I heard they watching you, yeah they watching you
They watching me too
But there ain't no reason to get low, I'm proud, I'm here
You know, I'ma stand up for you, no matter what; and I know you'll stand up for me
I don't have no doubt about you being true to me
The world is ours, but right now i feel like the whole world is against us
So study, be strong, don't cry no more
