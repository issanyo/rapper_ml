[Intro]
Aye, okay
Aye, aye, aye, Young Juice

[Verse 1]
Got my pot? Check
Got my fork? Check
Got my right hand? Check
Got my right man? Check
Then I go and get fifty blocks and bust me a check
Young Juiceman riding Fruity Pebble [?]
Show out of town, take the Fruity Loop jet
Blue and yellow diamonds, look like a Crip set
A Waffle King Bugatti, I spent 200 flat
A two-door Maserati with the crocodile back
Stepping out with Maury and it's suit, shoes, and hat
OJ da Juice with the game overtaxed
Gold grill dog and I done pushed a lot of packs
I done sold a lot of packs and I done moved a lot of sacks
Stack-A-Holic, dog, the way the paper's stacked
I'm booming off the chain, nigga, how you love that?
A Taco Bell Charger with the diamond floor to match
The cab is Chevy with them 28 flats

[Hook]
Got the work (oh, fa'sho)
Got the purp (oh, fa'sho)
Got the pills (oh, fa'sho)
Got the deals (oh, fa'sho)
Got the blocks (oh, fa'sho)
Got the spot (oh, fa'sho)
Got the gwap (oh, fa'sho)
We make it hot, (oh, fa'sho)
Got the work (oh, fa'sho)
Got the purp (oh, fa'sho)
Got the pills (oh, fa'sho)
Got the deals (oh, fa'sho)
Got the blocks (oh, fa'sho)
Got the spot (oh, fa'sho)
Got the gwap (oh, fa'sho)
We make it hot, (oh, fa'sho)

[Verse 2]
Life's a bitch, you gotta stay on your grind
I'm posted on the corner from sunup to sundown
Dope boys, we gon' get it, we gon' spend it
We gon' drive it, we gon' trap it, we gon' get it, let's get it
Making paper, dog, rain, sleet, or snow
Shopping with the Juice, I'll get you units of the blow
My trap spot like a nigga being stole
It's like a tax holiday, the prices so low
Gold grill dog, pills buried with the dope
I'm cooking up the waffle like Eggo with the coke
I spin it with the fork and a little soda, though
Wrist game sick, so my face and neck froze
They call me Subzero 'cause my flow is so cold
Better yet, refrigerator, ice trays the hoes
Open up my mouth, I see nothing but the gold
32 and SS who get it out the bowl

[Hook]
Got the work (oh, fa'sho)
Got the purp (oh, fa'sho)
Got the pills (oh, fa'sho)
Got the deals (oh, fa'sho)
Got the blocks (oh, fa'sho)

Got the gwap (oh, fa'sho)
We make it hot, (oh, fa'sho)
Got the work (oh, fa'sho)
Got the purp (oh, fa'sho)
Got the pills (oh, fa'sho)
Got the deals (oh, fa'sho)
Got the blocks (oh, fa'sho)
Got the spot (oh, fa'sho)
Got the gwap (oh, fa'sho)
We make it hot, (oh, fa'sho)

[Verse 3]
Got the work for the low, got the pills for the cheap
Let's keep it in this business and low in the street
I ain't fucking with you lames 'cause sucker, that's industry
I'm a money making motherfucker plus I'm a G
Me and the fishscale Pyrex pot, doing it by the week
Man, I'm flipping 20 chickens, dog, understand me
Nigga, my wrist game sick, my pinky ring, too
In my trap spot, chickens standing next to you
Purp by the pound, QP for 22
Try to jack shit, knock you clean out your shoes
Mid for the stack, trap niggas, what it do?
Fruity colored chain: black, yellow, white, and blue
645 with the Davin 22's
Cadillac truck painted red, white, and blue
Young Juiceman with a swag so true
Try to imitate, that's so not you

[Hook]
