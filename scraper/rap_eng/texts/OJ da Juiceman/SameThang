[Intro]
Same thang (2x), I be on that same thang
Same thang (2x), shoot ‘em up and bang bang
Same thang (2x), I be on that same thang
Same thang (2x), I can sell some cocaine

[Hook]
Same thang (2x), I be on that same thang
Same thang (2x), shoot ‘em up and bang bang
Same thang (2x), I be on that same thang
Same thang (2x), I can sell some cocaine

[Verse 1]
Every day, same thang, watch me do my chain swang
Nigga I don’t gangbang, all I do is sell cocaine
In the kitchen, turning water, my right wrist is hurricane
I’m just like the Chinese folks, I be on that same thang
In the trap for 5 days, still wearing the same thang
Shoot it out every day, I be on that same thang
Paper chasing every day, I be on that same thang
Police tryna build a case, young Juiceman won’t say a thang
Police ass nigga, boy, ‘bout you, I can’t say the same
Flying in the eagle boy plus I’m rolling paper planes
Plus I keep that eagle boy, your whole face, I will paint
In the Coupe with the gas, now the whole car stank
Drinking lean out the [?] ‘cause I got them stupid [?]
Pockets on ATM, I’m a walking, talking bank
Talking ‘bout some cocaine, I be on that same thang
Shoot ‘em up and bang bang, I be on that same thang

[Hook]
Same thang (2x), I be on that same thang
Same thang (2x), shoot ‘em up and bang bang
Same thang (2x), I be on that same thang
Same thang (2x), I can sell some cocaine

[Verse 2]
He don’t fuck with me, same thang on my end
Thousand dollar shoes so my footwork high end
26,000 [?] chickens on the low end
Still doing shows, get deposit and I’m back in
If your hoe disrespect me then she get the back hand
Pull up all black, looking like I was the Batman
Bags of the gas, smoke mine out the pound, man
Watching out for snakes, I don’t give no fucking pound, man
Fuck you, too on my end, same thang for old friends
Still fuck with [?] and them, trapping in some Timberlands
[?] like Timbaland, cooking fish, no fisherman
Yellow nigga, minutemen, pour a 4 in Minute Maid
Choppa like beats, you can call it Dr. Dre
Shoot it up and bang bang, I be on that same thang
Cooking up some cocaine, I be on that same thang (2x)

[Hook]
Same thang (2x), I be on that same thang
Same thang (2x), shoot ‘em up and bang bang
Same thang (2x), I be on that same thang
Same thang (2x), I can sell some cocaine
