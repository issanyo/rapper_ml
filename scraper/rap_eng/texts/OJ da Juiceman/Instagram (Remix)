[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
Put the chopper on Instagram, now they catchin feelings
Niggas got killed, they showed me Instagram pictures
But I was out of town, doing shows, smokin swishers
Pickin up a bag, but the pussy went missing
We dun call em' goldfish, the pussies went swimming
Hundred round drums, .44 for the witness
Still got the gas and you know I keep it wit me
What the hell you talkin nigga? I'm a keep it pimpin'
1000 is the lingo, came up playin bingo
Plugged in wit Migos, nachos, tacos and burritos
Flex! Flex! Flex! Throwin plays like Dan Marino
Kilt em wit a .50 then I went and got the Lambo
