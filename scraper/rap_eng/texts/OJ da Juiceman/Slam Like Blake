[Intro]
Slam like Blake when I'm posted in the trap
40 band jug, that's a 10 band cap
Try to pull a move then I peel your cap
Young Juiceman, he don't play like that
Swear you's a killer but nigga, you's a rat
2 or 3 [?] 200 flat
Whipping up the work, you can call it flapjack
21 zips like a game of Blackjack

[Hook] (3x)
Sl-slam like Blake, damn near broke my wrist
Sl-slam like Blake, damn near broke my wrist

[Verse 1]
Slam like Blake when I'm posted in the trap
40 band jug, that's a 10 band cap
Try to pull a move then I peel your cap
Young Juiceman, he don't play like that
Swear you's a killer but nigga, you's a rat
2 or 3 [?] 200 flat
Whipping up the work, you can call it flapjack
21 zips like a game of Blackjack
Spent a couple dollars but I made it right back
I'm a real trapper, just stating a fact
Stupid wrist game, should've put it in the back
Jumping out the gym like I'm doing jumping jacks
Do a magic trick, pull a rabbit out the hat
Bricks of [?], got bricks on deck
Brand new cooler on a 30 shot Tec
Swimming pool [?], man the shit got wet
Slow it down
Skrrt! (4x)
Speed it up
Whip (4x)
Slow it down
Skrrt! (4x)
Speed it up
Whip (4x) (Aye!)

[Hook] (2x)
Sl-slam like Blake, damn near broke my wrist
Sl-slam like Blake, damn near broke my wrist

[Verse 2]
Broke my wrist cooking fish, whip a brick
36, 2 a zip, broke down to nicks
Calculator, where my scale? Ain't missing shit
Talking slick, pull up quick, hit 'em with the stick
Back to business, back in the kitchen, time to plug some chickens
Water whipping (2x), get some extra digits
Doing numbers (2x), I'm a mathematician
Training day (2x), I got them flying pigeons
Cooking cookies (2x), yeah I got them frisbees
I got them babies (2x) like I signed with Disney
In the trenches with Whitney, .40 by kidney
Posted in the trap, boy I'm slamming like Blake Griffin (Aye!)

[Hook] (2x)
Sl-slam like Blake, damn near broke my wrist
Sl-slam like Blake, damn near broke my wrist

[Verse 3]
Slam like Blake, call me Jake the Flake
Watching for the jakes, watching for the snakes
Ol' police ass nigga, tryna send me upstate
'Cause I'm kingpin status, steak and lobster on my plate
With my right hand, I make millions
Came from 'partment buildings
Slamming on these niggas like my name was Blake Griffin
You know I keep white like that boy Andy Griffin
Pull up on your set, leave you sleeping with the fishes
Heard you sneak dissing but nigga, you ain't official
Black and white diamonds like the man who blow the whistle
'88 box, inside color tissue
No I'm not from Russia but my Glock hold missiles, nigga

[Hook] (2x)
Sl-slam like Blake, damn near broke my wrist
Sl-slam like Blake, damn near broke my wrist
