[Intro]
We poured up over here, Frank
Chyeah, ayyyyye…
Chyeah, whoa

[Verse 1]
Alaska in Atlanta and I’m colder than a panda
Trapping out a panorama, 50 bricks is on my scanner
Used choppa with this anna, t’working Miley, Hannah Montana
And you know I keep the bricks, you can call me Tony Montana
Michael Jackson with the wrist, got me playing with dirty Diana
Got keys just like pianos, in the mob like Tony Soprano
Got bombs like [?] and we sell burritos
Nacho with the cheese, pockets on Dorito’s
Military guns but they short as Danny Devito
’71 donk same color as a Cheeto
Tryna dodge the bloodsuckers, they worser than mosquitos
I just caught your sister and your BM, had a trio

[Hook]
One night, baby I’m only here for one night (3x)
Only here for one night (2x)
One night, baby I’m only here for one night (3x)
Only here for one night (2x)

[Verse 2]
What it is? What it do? My neck and wrist got bird flu
Flying down the Crest but I got chickens in the damn Coupe
Your baby momma with me, love the reflection of my gold tooth
I’m a trapper baby, I’m nothing like you used to
Pull up [?], motor kind of cuckoo
She wanna catch the wave, baby, come and ride this sea do
Skrrt (2x), work (2x), I be selling T-shirts
Squirt (2x), work (2x), she wanna wear my T-shirt
I’m a dog, I’m a jerk, I’ma get that jaw first
[?] in a tall ‘vert, told her wear that [?] skirt
Bitch wanna skate, told that hoe that that was small work
32 ENT, I’m the man with the work

[Hook]
One night, baby I’m only here for one night (3x)
Only here for one night (2x)
One night, baby I’m only here for one night (3x)
Only here for one night (2x)
