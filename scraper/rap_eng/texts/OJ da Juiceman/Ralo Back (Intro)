[Intro: Gucci Mane & Ralo]
Back to back with Ralo and we ain't even deep though
How your clique compare to mines when you ain't even street though?
It's Gucci!
New mixtape, yeah
Ralo LaFlare
FamGoon
How you start that tape out nigga?

[Verse 1: Ralo]
I'm startin' out my tape thanking god first
I never cry 'bout when it's hard 'cause shit could be worse
Am I wrong for giving dope money to the church?
I know I'm wrong but fuck a job, I went and got the work
I'm back inside the kitchen tryna make a living
We get them pigeons and we bring them bitches down to fifties
First nigga in the city Hellcats and verts
I was selling bricks of bow when you was sellin' percs
We sick of going out bad, we got enough of that
A nigga try that shit again and we gon' bust his ass
I'm still countin' money in the projects
We don't rent apartments, buy the whole complex
Gucci back bitch, look who he back with
I slap the shit out a rapper for all that rap shit
Yeah that them niggas fuck with Gucci
I'll have a thousand of 'em shooting
I say what the fuck I wanna say and they ain't did shit to me

[Chorus: Ralo]
A lot of niggas talkin' but they ain't 'bout that action
We gon' shoot a movie, but we ain't doin' no acting
Yeah I hear a lot of y'all niggas talkin' 'bout that shit
But y'all niggas ain't really 'bout that shit
A lot of niggas talkin', but they ain't 'bout that action
We gon' shoot a movie, but we ain't doin' no acting
A lot of y'all niggas doin' all that acting out here
Better stick to your script fuck nigga
Fake ass nigga

[Verse 2: OJ da Juiceman]
Trapping all day, trapping hallways
Three-sixty-five, nigga gotta get paid
Still serving J's, still catching plays
Still cookin' yay, no face, no case
A thousand eight grams sittin' on a nigga's plate
He dropped the ball, not my fault, I helped that nigga ate
No hating over here, boy we super straight
Fishscale clean but we ain't seen a lake
Keep dog food, still pushin' weight
Keep a draco, shoot it in your face
Pack of backwoods, took a zip to the face
Thirty-two FamGoon, how you wanna play?

[Chorus: Ralo]
A lot of niggas talkin' but they ain't 'bout that action
We gon' shoot a movie, but we ain't doin' no acting
Yeah I hear a lot of y'all niggas talkin' 'bout that shit
But y'all niggas ain't really 'bout that shit
A lot of niggas talkin', but they ain't 'bout that action
We gon' shoot a movie, but we ain't doin' no acting
A lot of y'all niggas doin' all that acting out here
Better stick to your script fuck nigga
Fake ass nigga

[Verse 3: Ralo]
I'm drippin', I'm drippin'
I'm blessed and I'm gifted
This shit made me stronger
I know they wished that it killed me
I got that cow and I milked it
My empire I built it
I never have to buy bricks
My shit come in the shipment
I fell in love with that cash
It got me busting my ass
No matter how this shit look
We won't ever look back
I'd give my last to my homies
Then give half to the homies
I'm the only one giving back
Them rappers is phonies
I get that bag with my team
I treat my bitch like a queen
She don't look at no niggas 'cause I'm the realest she seen
You know I gotta stay clean
'cause they did me so dirty
And when I look at myself
I see that they didn't deserve me

[Chorus: Ralo]
A lot of niggas talkin' but they ain't 'bout that action
We gon' shoot a movie, but we ain't doin' no acting
Yeah I hear a lot of y'all niggas talkin' 'bout that shit
But y'all niggas ain't really 'bout that shit
A lot of niggas talkin', but they ain't 'bout that action
We gon' shoot a movie, but we ain't doin' no acting
A lot of y'all niggas doin' all that acting out here
Better stick to your script fuck nigga
Fake ass nigga
