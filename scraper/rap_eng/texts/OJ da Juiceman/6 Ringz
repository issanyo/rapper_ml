[Hook]
Six rings on like MJ
Stupid ass money like I'm in the NBA
Blue colored diamonds like the bottom of a lake
With this stupid ass jewelry and my diamonds like a snake
Balling like a fool like I'm in the NBA
Swishing like a fool like it's 2K
With this stupid stupid jewelry and that money in your face
Six rings on and my diamonds got a glaze

[Verse 1]
Ballplayer rings, ballplayer money
Pull up in that Hummer and it's sitting on Asantis
Bouldercrest working, but I got that stupid money
Green diamond chain, same color as the funky
Texaco working and I still serve the junkies
Honey-colored Hummer, but it still cost money
Mama said, "Don't do it", but you know I stay stunting
Pinky ring thirty thousand, so I get that money
Still get my car washed by a damn zombie
Coogi and the Prada, Juice stack the hundreds
Alligator Maury's same color as the swamp eaters
Young Juiceman and your hoe love my adlibs

[Hook]
Six rings on like MJ
Stupid ass money like I'm in the NBA
Blue colored diamonds like the bottom of a lake
With this stupid ass jewelry and my diamonds like a snake
Balling like a fool like I'm in the NBA
Swishing like a fool like it's 2K
With this stupid stupid jewelry and that money in your face
Six rings on and my diamonds got a glaze

[Verse 2]
Six rings on like I play with Jordan
Working white chickens and them bricks imported
Niggas hating on me 'cause they bitch want me
Looking at my clock, it's early morning money
Beating up the white girl, gotta serve buddy
Ten chickens in and it's gone by Thursday
Right wrist iced out, looking like a lighthouse
Yellow-colored diamonds if you like a bottle of Cristal
Young Juiceman, give my VVS a wipe down
In my trap house and your hoe is getting piped down
Stupid ass swag and I can't turn this shit down
Microwave swag, man, that shit 'bout eight hundred now

[Hook]
Six rings on like MJ
Stupid ass money like I'm in the NBA
Blue colored diamonds like the bottom of a lake
With this stupid ass jewelry and my diamonds like a snake
Balling like a fool like I'm in the NBA
Swishing like a fool like it's 2K
With this stupid stupid jewelry and that money in your face
Six rings on and my diamonds got a glaze
