HOOK
Bands on deck, I can buy a nigga right now
Roller-coaster high, I don't think I can come down
Tractor trailer loads way taller than Stone Mountain
Man the whole chicken got me playing with them birds now

VERSE 1
Kyle Korver bricks, just paid 26
Balling off the bricks, I get me a swish
Making bands off the fish
Cooking white same color as grits
I got 6 rings on my fists and I came from selling nicks
Trying to dodge the narcs had to jump the damn fence
But a nigga got away, so I guess I'm too legit
With my arm in the pot, trap going hammer bitch
I'm a skirt skirt, whip the dope, collect the currency
Booming off the chain aye, crack bought me my chain aye
I would never change aye, not even for some change aye
Put change on your brain aye, pull up do his thing aye
Make a nigga famous aye, put him on a shirt
Put him on a hearse

VERSE 2
Playing with them birds, trapping off the curb
Had to answer my phone: nigga what's the word?
Texting while I'm driving damn near made a nigga swerve
Making moves in the rental got a trunk full of work
I got lean, I got mo, I be selling t-shirt
I be booming, I be bunking, my trap house jump like it's Jordan
Dropping mountains in the water so I can meet my quota
Then I skirt skirt skirt skirt make the yay jump over
Add a little soda, coke no cola
Get money is the motive, Bouldercrest solider
Trying to stay high, like a fucking roller-coaster
Run up on me, smoke you
Burn you like a toaster
Make your face a poster

VERSE 3
Tractor trailer loads, got me at the stove
Stay to the G-code, I will never fold
Going in the water, cooking up the O's
J's love the odor, boy this dope is ghetto gold
Seen seven figures come up out that Pyrex bowl
And the game is to be sold, never to be told
I got chickens in the Sprinter, coming up the road
I'm my own shooter nigga call me Derrick Rose
In a '71 dunk same color as a road
Treat these niggas like some babies; don't make me wipe your nose
Gotta tax a nigga make you pay me like a toll
32 Ent, I got bands like Wells Fargo
