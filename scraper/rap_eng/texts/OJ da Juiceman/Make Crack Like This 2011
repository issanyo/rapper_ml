[Verse 1]
Make crack like this, bitch, I'ma do numbers
It's our summer, pockets on cucumber
Take a 36 and I bust it up like lumber
NFL router running but I don't fumble
Late night trapping, I be up like Brian Gumble
Say you got a trap, if I post up, you in trouble
Culinary art school got me on my hustle
Dimes so big, boy it look like they got muscles
Workers in my trap, try to rob, they might bust ya
Then I move my trap so I'm still like fuck ya
Hydro shock tips make you sing like Usher
I be selling glass, man your shit bust like it's Gushers
I be smoking kush, man you suckers ain't no hustlers
Pyrex and a fork make me wanna serve your momma
I know crack kills but it got me doing numbers
32 ENT, it's our summer

[Verse 2]
Put the soft in the pot, run the water 'til it's hot
Then you post up on the corner, make yourself a stupid knot
Put your bomb in the bushes to conceal it from the cops
50 slab in my mouth, couple rocks off in my socks
Heavy trap-tivity going on in the south
If we fuck around, get caught, we was taught to close our mouths
Open up our ears and my eyes like an owl
And I had to lawyer up so the Juice don't get green mile
36 OZs man and I got it in right now
You can join a circus 'cause I don't know this clown
No new customers, that's how I get down
Drop a 125 then that 125 got drowned
Pull out 125, 125 weigh 120
Caught a couple of traps, now I'm flying down I-20
Pull out 125, 125 weigh 120
Caught a couple of traps, now I'm flying down I-20

[Hook]
Make, make, make, make, make crack like this

Make, make, make, make, make crack like this
Make, make, make, make, make crack like this

[Verse 3]
First step, you get a chick but before you buy that chick
Make sure it's 100 man, sucker niggas be trying shit
Drop a 14 out the 16, baby [?]
Then you hit the corner store to purchase you some baggies
And I bought a case of rillos 'cause I got that gas in
Thousand dollar 28s got young Juiceman ass in
Every day I take risks, use my wrist and dodge the pen
Same clothes 4 days, you can tell I'm getting in
[?] but I'm never doing the spin
I'ma do the glass house, that's gon' make the J's spin
Duplex trapping soft and hard, second half kush and mid
Standing in the kitchen and my chain size as my partner kid
32 ENT, dawg you know we do it big
Don't tolerate [?] and we down to split a wig
32 ENT, dawg you know we do it big
Don't tolerate [?] and we down to split a wig
