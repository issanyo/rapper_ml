[Intro: Jr. Boss]
I don't need one
I don't need no dope
I don't need no dope
Take it it off the henges

[Chorus: Jr. Boss]
Drivin' old school foreign coupes, box Chevys and the Benzs
Get that paper, [?] driveway, take your dope straight off the henges
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges
Last deal right around the corner, time to start a feeding frenzy
X pills, kush marijuana, time to make these niggas envy
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges

[Verse 1: Jr. Boss]
I know I just got outta prison, my double cup filled up with fuego
I'm just tryna get me some chips, you know I ain't talkin' potato
Been shoppin' at harlem, no perfect homptie, rubies on my neck it red, bloody stones
I bought me a spot just to lay low and stack up my pesos, I call this my lil honey comb
Huh, huh, burglar boys, yeah the dolla, huh, I don't mean like a robot
Huh, one stove working' four pots, your ho wanna suck on my blowjob
I need to scale some bags, a couple cigars, I call these my lil utensils
[?] the neighbors are sick 'cause I'm smokin some shit that's so loud it sound like a whistle
AR-15s and the sound like some missiles, please do not play or you gon' get your head shoot
Ain't no [?] so go get your pistol, shittin' on niggas so pass me a tissue
Gucci and Fendi that I have is expensive, car pull up in my driveway like it [?]
Went and bought up my dog is a Shih Tzu, [?] real fast like I'm Twista

[Chorus: Jr. Boss]
Drivin' old school foreign coupes, box Chevys and the Benzs
Get that paper, [?] driveway, take your dope straight off the henges
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges
Last deal right around the corner, time to start a feeding frenzy
X pills, kush marijuana, time to make these niggas envy
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges

[Verse 2: Jr. Boss]
Everybody blowin' money, I prefer to hide mine
Niggas say I'm actin' funny, [?] on the side line
Foreigns make a nigga silent, pull up then it's quiet time
Gotta always watch your back and front, forgot about your blind side
You niggas ain't gettin' no money you miserable, bailin' around, that's how I do miracles
You get pulled up with you don't say [?], [?] with OG 'cause they say it's a miracle
Bust down that Bentley like some syllables, get you so high you feel like it's spiritual
The niggas you shop with, their prices is typical, tabs on the dope you would think you were clerical
Pull up in your city, I'ma bring them bags through
[?] us for the gas just like it was cashews
Pull up, serve you out the bag, treat it like it's fast food
Get my plug walk, all these chickens talkin', ain't nobody ask you

[Chorus: Jr. Boss]
Drivin' old school foreign coupes, box Chevys and the Benzs
Get that paper, [?] driveway, take your dope straight off the henges
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges
Last deal right around the corner, time to start a feeding frenzy
X pills, kush marijuana, time to make these niggas envy
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges

[Verse 3: OJ da Juiceman]
Work my dough, work my dough, my dough ain't got no henges
In the boat, out the pot, my dough look like a frisbee
Trapped out like a nine to five, I specialize in winnin'
Skr, skr, whip the white, I keep church [?] chicken
Glock 30S, pussy you [?] never slippin'
Amazing figure, planning in the kitchen
Straight drop chickens, never water whippin'
We can make a million, just gotta stay consistent
Watch me swing my front door, uh
J's lined up full of dough, uh
Quavo the million on the flow, uh
Draco on the sofa, uh
Play with a nigga and its over, uh
All my grams jumpin' over, uh
Gotta stay up like Folgers, uh
Came up sellin' boulders, uh

[Chorus: Jr. Boss]
Drivin' old school foreign coupes, box Chevys and the Benzs
Get that paper, [?] driveway, take your dope straight off the henges
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges
Last deal right around the corner, time to start a feeding frenzy
X pills, kush marijuana, time to make these niggas envy
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges
I just want my dough off the henges, I just want my dough off the henges
