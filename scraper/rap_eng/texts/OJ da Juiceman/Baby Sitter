[Verse 1: Cap1]
In the kitchen whippin baby's nigga
They about to drive me crazy nigga
I just got rid of my old lady nigga
Rock all my gold like an 80's nigga
Whippin the work going crazy staying in the kitchen with choppers
I whip with the asians loosing is not a option
I come to your city with ?
Mind on money nigga no distractions
We tote the 30 poppin' yeah you know we got it
Trap jumpin' off the gym fuck you and pay me
Cold world on the phone don't need a babysitter
Baking soda yola fuckin' up the "oprah's"
Front to the back young nigga do it run like i'm watch to the ?

[Hook: OJ Da Juiceman & Cap1]
In the kitchen whippin baby's nigga (aye)
In the kitchen whippin baby's nigga (aye)
In the kitchen whippin baby's nigga (aye)
