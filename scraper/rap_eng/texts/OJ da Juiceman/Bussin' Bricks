[Verse]
Juice sell bricks, coming straight out of Georgia
Bust a brick down, put the deuces in the water
Small fry nigga, man, you got to hustle harder
Bouldercrest nigga, so you know I hustle smarter
Juice sell bricks, coming straight out of Georgia
Bust a brick down, put the deuces in the water
Small fry nigga, man, you got to hustle harder
Bouldercrest nigga, so you know I hustle smarter
Juice sell bricks, 22/5 for the whole thing
Post up in your hood with them sweet and mild hot wings
Coupe on deuces, plus I sell deuces
Working out of houses, Pyrex maid cooking
Right hand nasty, pinky ring stupid
Selling two donks, same color as Cupid
Nigga try the Juice, knock him out with a fool hit
Make it to the [?] you done made a full clip
Hundred-fifty round drum, nutsack boolish
Pull up to the club in a '08 dually
Outfit fruity, blowing on kushy
Young Juiceman and my life just like the moula
