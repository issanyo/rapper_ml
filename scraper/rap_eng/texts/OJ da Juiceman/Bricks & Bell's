[Intro]
Chyeah (2x)
Whoa

[Hook] (2x)
I want some bricks and some bales
Bricks and some bales (3x)
I want some bricks and some bales
Bricks and some bales (3x)

[Verse 1]
I want some bricks and some bales, keep my pockets swell
Heavy clientele, work my wrist well
If I go to jail, I would never tell
Point me to my cell, just bring me my mail
I know I’m going to Heaven ‘cause I already done went through Hell
In the club I’m balling but I’m trapping like a snail
Playing with the white, same color as the sails
Posted in the hood, man I’m tryna make a sell
Bricks, ounces, deuces, gas by the bale
Screech on my chain, it was saved by the bell
All I ever wanted was some bricks and some bales
Bouldercrest El Chapo, [?] mayor
Cooking up the white, same color as the mayo
Hop up out the Coupe, all the hoes be like “Aye, O”
Working with the bricks, mayo on the payroll
Wrapping up the bricks like they did a roll

[Hook] (2x)
I want some bricks and some bales
Bricks and some bales (3x)
I want some bricks and some bales
Bricks and some bales (3x)
