2 x Hook:
Live my life on the edge, p**sy nigga I won't  jump
Running to that valley  p**sy nigga gonna run
15 years trappin’ , I was taught to hold my tounge
Bouldercrest nigga, with a bouldercrest bomb

Verse
Juice what you’re doing?
Standing in the kitchen
Straight drop fish, while the other nigga wippin’
Juice you need to rap ,nigga I ain’t rappin shit
Unless im in the trap house unwrappin these bricks
Juice you ain’t focus, dawg what you sayin’
I’m in the hood daily with my fork and the pan
Juice you 1000 that’s all I be sayin
36 zip cost you 40 clean bandz
Juice you on some other shit, nah im One hundun
Call me Paul Bunyon ‘cause Im all about that lumber
I’m a walking calculator ,all I know numbers
Like symbols in your iPhone, all I like is commas

[2 x Hook:]

Verse
Juice you ain't street, p**sy what you sayin’
P**sy go to playin and the p**sy getting smashed
Juice you ain't no killer, , that’s why I got a bandz
Green light a nigga, getting whole crew wet
Juice a real trap nigga, my life on the edge
Running to that fire I gotta get my bread
Juice you play soccer that ain’t how i play
Make a p**sy nigga make his own bed, he got to lay in it
Lost Block Beata, When we was on the [?]
He was in the wheel chair but he was my best friend
Ever since they took Duke and Deon,  I’ve been lurking
Stayin on my P's so they won't catch me and murk me
