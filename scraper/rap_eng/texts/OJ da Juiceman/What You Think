[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
What you think this is?
Uh, just did 120 on the 110 (skrrt)
Ayy, ayy, don't need no new friends
Ayy, top me in the whip, just might crash the Benz
Yeah, ooh, yeah, what you think this is?
Ayy, I woke up this morning counted half a M, yeah
Ooh, yeah, what you think this is? Yeah
Uh, what you think this is? (Ooh, yeah)
What you think this is?

Huh, huh, VVS the wrist, what you think this is?
Brand new coupe outside, this a brand new vibe
She love Dolla $ign, she know every line
Yeah, what you think this is? Uh, uh (ooh, yeah)
No pictures, bitch, what you think this is? (Ooh yeah)
Diamond cross, tennis bracelet, that's just regular (ooh yeah)

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
She gon' bring a friend
Ain't no 1-on-1s, what you think this is?
I got whips outside, different color shit
TMZ outside, they like, "Is that him?"
What you thought this was?
Girl, I thought I told you, never fall in love
Put some sauce on the shrimp
Wipe me down, I'm a pimp, bankroll like a blimp
Red 'Rari lookin' rich, got the money comin' in, like it's 1996
Puttin' gas in the whip, don't smoke no Reggie in the whip
What the fuck you think this is?

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
What you think this is?
Uh, just did 120 on the 110
Ayy, ayy, don't need no new friends

Ayy, I woke up this morning counted half a M, yeah
Ooh, yeah, what you think this is? Yeah
Uh, what you think this is? Ooh, yeah

[Verse 3: OJ da Juiceman]
I just did 'em bad, uh, brand new, paper tag, uh
Flyin' down 110 in a R-Type Jag
I just blowed a bag, uh, can you do the math? Uh
What you think this is? Uh, million dollar crib, uh
Backyard, take a swim, uh, still trap again, uh
Slam dunkin' bricks, uh, like above the rim, uh
Drop them zips in the water, swim, baby, swim, uh
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, jumpin' out the gym

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
What you think this is?
Uh, just did 120 on the 110
Ayy, ayy, don't need no new friends
Ayy, top me in the whip, just might crash the Benz
Yeah, ooh, yeah, what you think this is?
Ayy, I woke up this morning counted half a M, yeah
Ooh, yeah, what you think this is? Yeah
Uh, what you think this is? Ooh, yeah
What you think this is?
