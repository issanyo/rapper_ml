[Intro]
Drank some lean (Aye)
Drank some lean (Damn)
Drank some lean (Okay)
Drank some lean (D-d-damn)
Drank some lean (2x)
On that lean
Actavis, nigga
We poured up over here, Frank
We gassed up, too
Juiceman in this motherfucker (Yessir)
What we doing, cuz?

[Hook]
Drinking lean and smoking bud (12x)
Drink some lean and smoking bud
Drinking lean and smoking bud
Drinking lean and smoke some bud (2x)

[Verse 1]
On that Ac', I love to pour
[?] codeine coming out my pores
Hi-Tech red, it keep me geeked
Green, pour me up, that make me sleep
Back when I had pints of orange
We laced the blunt, now we smoking sherm
But now I got that Actavis
Young Juiceman, he don't be sharing
Smoking up the Cali gas
Freddie sent the gas and don't be caring
Pull up in that '71
Halloween donk, black and orange look scary
How you get them hustling skills? I got it from my business [?]
Just put me a 4 into it and now my cup is extra berry (Aye!)

[Hook]
Drinking lean and smoking bud (12x)
Drink some lean and smoking bud
Drinking lean and smoking bud
Drinking lean and smoke some bud (2x)

[Verse 2]
Momma said stay off of it, I said that's just that cough syrup
She say the way I drink it, boy I might need me a counselor
Smoking up the gas and my lungs like a muffler
Glock 18, extension clip and a muzzler
Drinking up the lean like I play with Houston Oilers
Flying in a Bentley, over 1600 spoiler
Posted in the hood, selling zips, I baby barter
Freddie sent the cases, 1500 dollar barter (Aye!)

[Hook]
Drinking lean and smoking bud (12x)
Drink some lean and smoking bud
Drinking lean and smoking bud
Drinking lean and smoke some bud (2x)
