[Intro: OJ da Juiceman]
Shyst Red, Juiceman
Cackalacky, ATL
Aye, aye, aye
Okay, okay

[Hook: Shyst Red & OJ da Juiceman]
Goddamn
Spectacular wrists, twenty get them 42's for [?] a brick
Damn
Wrist game nasty
Catch me posted in the kitchen, busting bricks out the plastic
Goddamn
Trap house pumping
Marble floor thrax got them J's coming
Damn
And we booming
Right hand shawty, whipping up the deuces

[Verse 1: OJ da Juiceman]
Goddamn, Juiceman stupid
Wrist game nasty, jewelry game fruity
Walmart Cutlass, Subway Buick
Sun Valley working and still serving deuces
Bouldercrest pitching, trap doing the [?]
Smoking up the kushy and it taste fruity
Fourty-thousand night, dog, and it's was on a Tuesday
'08 Magnum, same color Ruby Tuesday
Young Juiceman, giving pounds to the groupie
Big Breitling ring, Perkys off them deuces
Been getting money since I was a student
Hummer H2 and it's riding on them [?]
Six stoves flaming so you know I'm cooking
Texaco serving, serving all the deuces
Six cell phones, dog, so you know I'm booming
'72 donk and it's offset Cupid

[Hook: Shyst Red & OJ da Juiceman]
Goddamn
Spectacular wrists, twenty get them 42's for [?] a brick
Damn
Wrist game nasty
Catch me posted in the kitchen, busting bricks out the plastic
Goddamn
Trap house pumping
Marble floor thrax got them J's coming
Damn
And we booming
Right hand shawty, whipping up the deuces

[Verse 2: Shyst Red]
36 [?] on the shelf like some moon pies
Hundred slabs in the bag, looking like some french fries
Or a big Chevy sitting on them skinny tires
Only 22's [?] and ride
Now they pumping stacks, rubberbands hold them faces
Straight drop glass, sounding like a celebration
Busting guns like the Matrix
Slow motion wrist game [?]
$248, nine O's, where the paper?
Bombs on the stove and my wrist the detonator
IPhone [?] niggas said he want a deuce
Leave them with the bag, got the package when you're 62
Certified trapper, get it in a wrapper
Marble floor thrax, white, call it Casper
Inside: peanut butter; outside: jam
Sunkist rims got the Feds like, "Damn"

[Hook: Shyst Red & OJ da Juiceman]
Goddamn
Spectacular wrists, twenty get them 42's for [?] a brick
Damn
Wrist game nasty
Catch me posted in the kitchen, busting bricks out the plastic
Goddamn
Trap house pumping
Marble floor thrax got them J's coming
Damn
And we booming
Right hand shawty, whipping up the deuces

[Outro: OJ da Juiceman]
Shyst Red, Juiceman
Cackalacky, ATL
Aye, aye, aye
Okay, okay
