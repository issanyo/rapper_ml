[Intro: Lil Meta]
Damn
I ain’t got NO more trees?
What kind of Christmas is that, for real?
I think I know who got the Santa, though
I’m fin-I’m finna call Juice, man
I’m finna take another trip to Zone 6

[Hook: OJ da Juiceman & Lil Meta]
Juiceman got the Santa
I got that loud pack, make it stank in East Atlanta
Juiceman got the Santa
I got that loud pack, make it stank in East Atlanta
Juiceman got the Santa
I got that loud pack, make it stank in East Atlanta
Goddamn, I’m booming
So go ahead and sell your boy a pound of the fruity

[Verse 1: Lil Meta]
What’s a merry Christmas without no trees?
Exactly, that Christmas ain’t merry
So on that note, I need my trees
Let me stop saying trees ‘cause I mean weed
A very good pack, no sticks, no seeds
And it sure gotta be L O U D
So back to the story ‘cause I need me a boost
So I called up my homie named OJ da Juice
He say he got the Santa that’ll stank East Atlanta
Like more than dude daily or a baby in a pamper
Name’s Lil Meta and I’m burned like a candle
And you know I keep it hood like a strawberry phantom

[Hook: OJ da Juiceman & Lil Meta]
Juiceman got the Santa
I got that loud pack, make it stank in East Atlanta
Juiceman got the Santa
I got that loud pack, make it stank in East Atlanta
Juiceman got the Santa
I got that loud pack, make it stank in East Atlanta
Goddamn, I’m booming
So go ahead and sell your boy a pound of the fruity

[Verse 2: Lil Meta]
Got my loud pack from OJ, now I’m straight
Tony the Tiger, kush smoke great
Lil Meta and the Juiceman make the trap aye!
If there’s twelve days of Christmas, I’m smoking every day
Fruity in my life, man, I need that shit
Ain’t no other place to get it but in Zone 6
I’m on the ‘crest, posted on the ‘crest
Smoking on the loud, man, I feel it in my chest
I’m a So Icey boy, so I only smoke the best
Got swag on X, I ain’t gotta flex
Name’s Lil Meta and I stay smoking Santa
I’m the So Icey Grinch, the new face of East Atlanta

[Hook: OJ da Juiceman & Lil Meta]
Juiceman got the Santa
I got that loud pack, make it stank in East Atlanta
Juiceman got the Santa
I got that loud pack, make it stank in East Atlanta
Juiceman got the Santa
I got that loud pack, make it stank in East Atlanta
Goddamn, I’m booming
So go ahead and sell your boy a pound of the fruity
