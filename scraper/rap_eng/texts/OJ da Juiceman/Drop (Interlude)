[Chorus:]
All em Ben Franklin's drop
All em Andrews
Don’t forget Abe Lincoln
[?] George Washington's too
Drop
All em Ben Franklin's drop
All em Andrews
Drop
All em drop[x4]

[Verse 1:]
Money, money ,money
All I see is dolla signs
Fuck with em they crazy
They green [?]
You colour blind
Glock forty, we thirty rouns
If you think bout takin mine
Playin with that pistol
Was fourteen when I got on that grind
All I wanna do pull her out my car and grill on shine
Open up a thirty six
You can call it captain crime
All I see is dolla sign
Shoppin at the damn [?]
On that street [?]
Young nigga I am a vet
Put me and you in a kitchen
See who cook the best
Michael Phelps, Brittany Reece
In the kitchen I’m a chef
How you get me [?]

[Chorus]
