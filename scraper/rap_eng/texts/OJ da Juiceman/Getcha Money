[Intro]
Whoo! (4x)
Run your bands up
Getcha money, young nigga
Run your bands up
Getcha money, young nigga

[Hook] (2x)
Trapping is essential, I got money on my mental
Got them bricks tucked in the rental, got no time for incidentals
Run your bands up
Getcha money, young nigga
Run your bands up
Getcha money, young nigga

[Verse 1]
I been trapping like a bitch, nigga
I'm down with the shit, nigga
Run up on me wrong, you can get banana split, nigga
I'm from Zone 6, nigga
Yeah I fucked your bitch, nigga
Thousand dollar kicks, nigga
Yeah I bust them bricks, nigga
Standing in the kitchen and you know I'm cooking fish, nigga
Finna get some money while you looking like a bitch, nigga
Polo, don't do Hilfiger
Hit your baby momma with the dill pickle
Working with the bag, boy I'm playing with the check
Posted in the trap with a brand new 'Vette
OG gas sent in from the west
17 shots named Smith & Wess'
Drinking up the oil like a nigga from Texas
You ain't no killer, you just shooting niggas texts's
Always pussy, nigga I ain't ever flexing
Sucker nigga still don't get no message
'Til the crime scene get real real messy
Nigga, fuck nigga gon' wind up missing
On a T-shirt, folks crying like bitches
Sucker nigga shouldn't have been chasing them riches
Sitting 'round talking like y'all some hoes!
Knew y'all fuck niggas raised like bitches
Young Juiceman, I'm straight up official
Quick to shoot a rock like my name Derrick Fisher
Hundred pack of mid just sent the nigga a picture
Four 36, boy you know I got to flip 'em

[Hook] (2x)
Trapping is essential, I got money on my mental
Got them bricks tucked in the rental, got no time for incidentals
Run your bands up
Getcha money, young nigga
Run your bands up
Getcha money, young nigga

[Verse 2]
I got money on my mental, I spent 10 racks on my dental
Man you know I got them birds when you see me riding rental
36 zips in a all white Jeep
20 whole thousand, just sell a nigga a split
Posted in the trap selling [?] tight [?]
Headlock the street, got the game vice gripped
Glock 27 with the index grip
[?] Gun, nigga come get dripped
Banana with the monkey but a nigga don't slip
Pull up to the club and my rims lipstick
Had [?] baby momma, bitch want the dick
All this ice, looking like a light switch
Hundred thousand dollars, spent it on my right wrist
Came from the valley but a nigga sell fish
Bomb like cable cause I got customers around this bitch like Dish
Blake Griffin in the pot, plug like Chris Paul, boy he threw an assist!
Now I'm standing in the kitchen playing with the chicken, young Juiceman work his wrist!
Then I "Skrrt, skrrt" in the pot, "Skkrt, skrrt" in the pot, Juiceman cooking bricks!
Zatarrain's (3x)
Young Juiceman cooking fish!
Now I'm posted at the Texaco with a big bomb, Young Juiceman tryna get rich!
Watching for the pigs, watching for the robbers but the Juiceman ain't no bitch!
Working with a 30, bomb in the bushes right beside the stick!
