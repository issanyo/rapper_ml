Im walking wit dem racks, Im blowin on this pack
Wit this kung fu jacket chain and my diamonds kick back
And my wrist be off the chain, Diamond rope like jumpin jacks
And I pull up in that hummer same color as Bill Jack
Wit this pit-bull grill and you runnin like a cat

Wit this spring time water on my bracelet
Pinky ring 30 thousand plus I got that sack
I walk and talk Brick dawg, can you top that
YBC and Juiceman , run and tell that
93 loud pack, stanky like a sack
YBC and Juiceman, run and tell that

Im guacamole shawty , baby im that guy
And my hummer on dem 8's , Baby im that guy
