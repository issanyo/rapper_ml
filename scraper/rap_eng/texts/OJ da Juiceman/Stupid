[Hook: Tity Boi]
I got a stupid sack
With a lot of Os
And when I pull up
I'm with a lot of hoes
I got a bankroll
Stupid bankroll
I got a bankroll
Stupid bankroll
I got a stupid sack
With a lot of Os
And when I pull up
I'm with a lot of hoes
I got a bankroll
Stupid bankroll
I got a bankroll
Stupid bankroll

[Verse 1: Tity Boi]
Anythang goes
I'm from the Southside
I got a stupid bitch
In my stupid ride
Yeah, I'm stupid wit' it
Cause I stupid get it
Shorty your car too small, have to stoop in it
Stupid kicks
I got a stupid wrist
Duffle Bag Boys, a.k.a. the Stupid Clique
Stupid this
Stupid that
Smokin' on that strong, call it a stupid pack
And this a stupid summer
And I'm stupid stuntin'
The way I move weight, call me Ruben Studdard
One stupid man
Two stupid chains
Three for the dope
Four for the brain
And she got stupid brain
I mean, stupid brain!
I took her to the mall
And bought her everythang
I bought her stupid Prada
I bought her stupid Louis
Everytime you see me
I be stupid fruity

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Oj Da Juiceman]
Stupid cars, stupid hoes
Damn I'm livin' stupid, dawg
VVS diamonds same color London fog
London fog? Hell yeah! Your bitch say she swallow balls
Pinky ring stupid big like I play some basketball
Football in the street
Hell naw, I'm in the street
Stupid color chain, diamonds look like Tweety tweet
Pull up to the club and the coupe on them Shaq feet
Trap goin' ham, bricks runnin' like a track meet
Young Juiceman and that stupid just attract me
Bouldercrest workin' and my motors in the back seat
Sun Valley workin' and my motors in the back seat
Tity, Juice and Dolla: all we do is stack cheese

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]
Came from the block where I used to be the middleman
Now I'm on the late flight, catch me in the business class
Niggas talkin' that bullshit? You better handle your business, fam
Hit 'em with the semis and
Never leave no witnesses
We don't need no witnesses
All about them dividends
Last nigga who tried me? You can't ask me what I did for him
Thousand grams of hard got my country boys comin' in
Hope they buy it all; if not, what I'm gon' do with this?
Duffle Bag, ho
Everything counts
We stay gettin' money
What the fuck are you about?
They know we got that stupid clout
Southside don't do a drought
I-16 with them things, I got a stupid route

[Hook]
