[Hook](Project Pat)
I got plenty cars, money wads, ghetto star, hood broads, felony charge, I'm gone keep it hood (2x)
You can take me out the hood, but I'm gone keep it hood (keep it hood!) (4x)

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
You can take me out the projects, not the projects out the nigga
Yeah you see I'm having thangs still, I'm gonna be a nigga
Liquor drankin, hit the grind
Pimpin' I did all the time
I ain't thinking 'bout no child support, I'm still gonna shine
Cause I'm still getting mine
One way or another doe
I ain't compromising with no judge, I ain't stuttered though
Others though, wanna back down, I'm fightin' to the end
If I get done up or something, I'mma gonna do ya in
A life sentence in the pen, what they want you to receive
I'm getting brain, making cheese, all that other's make-believe
And I still ride chrome rims and I shoot K's
Still hangin' with my dogs, and we blowin' purp for days

[Verse 2: OJ Da Juiceman]
I'm so hood Juiceman been convicted
Dekalb county dope charges got me twisted
Bubba Kush is blowin', and its in a Swisher
Ghetto broad, ghetto car, its a perfect picture
Take me out the hood, hell naw I'm still pitchin'
Apartment raised, I didn't do no picket fences
Been shot eight times so they got me high defenses
Pussy nigga leg shooter got me with a limpin'
Scrap bitch, yeah I'm strapped bitch, with an AK
Young Juiceman at the (??) with (??)
I'm so hood, Juiceman done got a throwaway
I'm so hood, 30 inches on the Chevrolet

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
When you see me in the club, fool I'm reppin' Tennessee
Arkansas and Mississippi, they just like some kin to me
Cause we ride the same way
More ghetto than section 8
Hustlin' to get our pay
Grew up shootin' on a crate
Can't forget about 201
Lower level powder (??)
Waking up with hard lids, funky breath, and sour dreads
Fighting cases, lawyer fees
Dropped the case, I copped a plea
Would have gave my life savings up so I could see them streets
Then I be back to the hood, where we watchin' over our shoulder
Ridin' with a hot pistol, hope police don't pull me over
Over in the bay, where we keep it North, understand
Take the man up out the ghetto, not the ghetto out the man
