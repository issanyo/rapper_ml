Try me and I don't swing
That's a no go nigga
All that reachin' for my chain
That's a no go nigga
Turn a freak into your main
That's a no go nigga
When you hear that click BANG!
Thats that .44 nigga
That's a no go, That's a no go
That's a no go, That's a no go (AYE!)
That's a no go, That's a no go
That's a no go, That's a no go (DAYUM!)
That's a no go, That's a no go
That's a no go, That's a no go (AYE!)
That's a no go, That's a no go
That's a no go, That's a no go (AAAYY!)

[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin]
It's 7:45 passin' out
It's 7:45 smashin' out
No lay away nigga, cashin' out
Ain't make it to the bed, crash the couch
That's a no go, I ain't cuffin' nan ho
Got them shooters on command, that's a ten fold
Band on the fit, fresh as fuck
Chain on my neck, never tucked
Brought her to the club, just to cuff
Bought the ho a drink, just to fuck
Dinosaur Dunk got me smashin' sharks
Turn a nigga block to Jurassic Park
Why a nigga tryna be asking God
Banned from the club 'cuz we smashing guards
Waffle House no ice in my orange juice
Stay iced up, me and Orange Juice
Look up to the Dirt Gang we the Colonels
Freestyle making hits no journals
Money first, bitches second like stepchilds
Scared of snakes, got a click full of reptiles

[Verse 2: OJ Da Juiceman]
That's a no go nigga
Juice stay ten toes nigga
With this .44 nigga
Toast a nigga like a burning swisher
If you think you're King Kong
Snatch my chain while I'm taking pictures
Pull out Pocket Rocket Master
Shoot your head with Russian missile
In the club they found mo' legs
Than the folk that make them pistols
At the club I test your girl
Guess her head was on a swivel
And I pound her 'til she died
After that she ate my pickle
Packin' cuffin' ass nigga, that's a no go nigga
Okay, Juice you pay for hoes? That's a low blow nigga
Man Juice you got them golds? That's an oh fo' sho' nigga
If you act 100? That's a no go nigga
And we don't fuck with fakes, that's an oh fo' sho' nigga
