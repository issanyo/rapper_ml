[Bridge: Icewear Vezzo]
We run it up to fuck it up
Finna run it up to fuck it up
We run it up to fuck it up
Said we run it up to fuck it up

[Hook: Icewear Vezzo]
40 bands on me, got me feelin’ like I’m Tony
Hit the motherfuckin’ stage
Moonwalking, moonwalking
Finna take the hundreds, throw this shit up like it’s nothing
All this motherfucking jewelry
Moonwalking, moonwalking

[Verse 1: OJ Da Juiceman]
Moonwalkin’ on this stage with this jewelry like I’m Michael
With the lights off, jewelry looking like a lighter
Blowing on the gas, baby all I smoke is fire
Me and Icewear, yeah we down like flat tires
Pat that nigga down cause he might be wearing a wire
Hit the road with it, I got bricks in the tire
Thousand dollar shoes, expensive garments for my attire
Detroit bound like I play for the Tigers
Boy I got the drank and I stay pouring lines up
Throwing up the four while I’m 8 Mile grinding
Fucking up the money but my diamonds steady shining
Thirty-two EMT the new big timing

[Hook: Icewear Vezzo]
40 bands on me, got me feelin’ like I’m Tony
Hit the motherfuckin’ stage
Moonwalking, moonwalking
Finna take the hundreds, throw this shit up like it’s nothing
All this motherfucking jewelry
Moonwalking, moonwalking

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
[?] Nike long pockets, grinding rocket swish
Diamonds dancing, my cologne got ‘em tryna catch their breath
They get cardiac arrest when they see the Cartier
Bling’ll blind you, glancing without glasses, vision get impaired
80’s baby, flavor, kitchen table, sticking to the script
Sold a lock and drop it straight to gangsters, I don’t want to whip
Trap beating, say he need a fix, watch out, break the wrist
Arm & Hammer going hammer time, too legit to quit
Black and white cells, let’s just say my clientele a panda
Thumbing through it, only run it up to fuck up with a dancer
Cash off the slab, junkies tryna flag me all in traffic
Gotta blast, moonwalking, Michael Jackson walking backwards

[Hook: Icewear Vezzo]
40 bands on me, got me feelin’ like I’m Tony
Hit the motherfuckin’ stage
Moonwalking, moonwalking
Finna take the hundreds, throw this shit up like it’s nothing
All this motherfucking jewelry
Moonwalking, moonwalking

[Verse 3: Icewear Vezzo]
Call me drank god but I feel like the lord
Always sippin’ lean, I feel like I’m snoring
And I got that chopper, it look like a sword
State to state I’m getting bands, bitch it’s like I’m touring
Hundred in the mattress
I don’t want no actresses
I just fuck them rap bitches
Yeah, then turn ‘em to them trap bitches

[Bridge: Icewear Vezzo]
We run it up to fuck it up
We run it up to fuck it up
I said we run it up to fuck it up
Bitch, we run it up to fuck it up

[Hook: Icewear Vezzo]
40 bands on me, got me feelin’ like I’m Tony
Hit the motherfuckin’ stage
Moonwalking, moonwalking
Finna take the hundreds, throw this shit up like it’s nothing
All this motherfucking jewelry
Moonwalking, moonwalking

[Outro: Icewear Vezzo & Kevin Gates]
We run it up to fuck it up (Michael Jackson walking backwards)
Finna run it up to fuck it up (Michael Jackson walking backwards)
We run it up to fuck it up (Michael Jackson walking backwards)
Said we run it up to fuck it up
