[Hook]
Buy the car, buy the house, spend it by the thousands
Money stacked tall trapping out the public housing
Buy the car, buy the house, spend it by the thousands
Money stacked tall trapping out the public housing

[Verse 1]
Money stacked tall, dog, every day, I get it
Running through this public housing, trying to see a meal ticket
I ain't playing no soccer, so the Juice don't kick it
I only fuck with those trying to get to them digits
Old school '72 sitting on them Scottie Pippen's
Blowing bubba kush and red eye is how the Juice live it
You can catch me in the hood, dog, busting down chickens
With multicolored diamonds got me all the pretty women
Eating Pappadeaux sharktail, take your bitch by Denny's
Man, I'm booming off the chain, dog, and I really live it
Man, I'm cooking up the Yola, call it ice water whipping
I'm doing it with one hand like I'm at Benihanna, chilling
Infiniti truck on them Davin floaters, steady spinning
Getting to the money like I'm doing shows in cities
With precious cut diamonds same color as Officer Friendly
Young Juiceman, dog, you got to fuck with me

[Hook]
Buy the car, buy the house, spend it by the thousands
Money stacked tall trapping out the public housing
Buy the car, buy the house, spend it by the thousands
Money stacked tall trapping out the public housing

[Verse 2]
Every day's a struggle trying to get it out the city street
So I'm posted up in the kitchen whipping up a quarter key
Got to stay down cause the dividends excite me
Young Juiceman and that cocaine entice me
Sack to sack living, man, I had to get the yayo off
Trapping out a house with a Mac-90 and sawed-off
Pyrex and that fork, longevity has paid off
Now I'm busting down them chickens, booming with a payoff
Porsche truck looking like some Chinese flavored duck sauce
Six cell phones got the trap spot jumping off
Riding on a war dawn, Atlanta Falcon touchdown
Tomahawk the Braves and I'm pitching off of Stone Mount
Lake under the jet ski's, a pound from the Indies
Money stacked tall way back from the 90's
Young Juiceman with a swag so cold
I ice grilled a necklace then I ice grilled my gold

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Imma' buy the car, buy the house, spend it by the thousands
On this chain here, Juice done spent 'bout 20 thousand
All my jewelery together worth a couple of duplex houses
Put it all together, man the Juice buying islands
G4 at the house, I had to buy a pilot
Cooking with my right hand, dog, and I'm stylish
Pockets with them guallas, so I'm walking with a swag
Dolces on my face got swagger-jackers think I'm mad
Neiman Marcus shopping and I'm walking out with bags
Pinkie ring looks like a 65 inch glass
OJ da Juice, and I'm the man with the cash
Trap spot full so I'm handing out bags
All these empty brick wrappers got me stacking trash
Trap by trap man, now I'm raking up the cash
'72 Impala and I done spent 'bout 40 cash
