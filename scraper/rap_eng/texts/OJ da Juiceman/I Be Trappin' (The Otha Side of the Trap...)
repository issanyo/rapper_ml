I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds
I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds
I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds
I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds

[Verse]
Trapping is a must, I be serving all the time
Man, I'm posted on the 'Crest with the bricks, pills, and pounds
Old-school Chevy, twenty inches off the ground
Blowing on this kush and roll it straight up out the pound
32 ENT, dog, we constantly working
'07 Avalanche, same color as Urkel
Flying down 20 and we all smoking purple
Twerking five phones, we'll call them chirp mobiles
Moving units, dog, that's an everyday hobby
Twenty-thousand dollars for the Juice to go shopping
Fifty-karat bracelet, eighty-karat chain
Spending big guap 'cause money ain't a thing
Got me moving, I be juuging, I be bussing niggas' heads
With this A1 recipe, got me all this bread
I'ma stay ten toes and try to duck the Feds
Young Juiceman, bitch, and I ain't never scared

I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
