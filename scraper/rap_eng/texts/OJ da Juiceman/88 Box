[Verse 1]
Eastside, eastside, yeah, Juice from eastside
88 Box same color as Popeye's
Busting fifty bricks, so my muscles like Popeye
Bouldercrest shawty and still selling cream pies
Post up on the mountain, add fifty to the small fry
Zone 6 up high, six fingers in the sky
Pull up to your trap, donk same color as the sky
Young Juiceman and I'll never tell a damn lie
Three phone Chevys about the same color as tie dye
Flip-flop paint got your girlfriend 'bout to cry
Swag through the mall, plug, yeah, I'm spending hundreds
By the end of the day, Juice gon' punch some numbers
That's that crazy swag, got your girl like the jumper
Gold grill, dog, and my spot doing numbers
Swing my front door, "Goddamn, Juice, you funky"
Young Juiceman, smoking pounds of that funky

[Verse 2]
Put your sides up, man, I'm repping my 6
Sun Valley shawty, still flipping bricks
Stupid wrapped up, goddamn it, I'm the shit
Calamari pasta with the sewer fish
And that was just for [?], I'm still twerking bricks
Six cell phones, still booming all the nicks
Right hand nasty, my neck is like a bitch
'Cause you can't get your woman unless you're flipping these bricks
Sixteen like a key, so you gotta pay me
Texaco Shawty, pull up with the baby
Paper bag working just to get that paper
Young Juiceman check a hater like paper
Spray a hater down, goddamn, he's a hater
'08 trapping, trapping in the Vader
Had to switch the spots up so they can't raid u
Stupid racked up so the lawyers stay paid up

[Verse 3]
88 Box, mounted up like a truck
And I pull in the dump, same size as a truck
Man, I shut that shit down when I pull up in the dump
[?] got me running like, "Fuck"
[?] with the kick got the Juice like, "Shit"
Man, I heard the motor often, I was still flipping bricks
In the premium-color Charger and it sits like bricks
Young Juiceman, cuz, riding '08 shit
