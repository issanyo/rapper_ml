[Hook]
Hummer and a Jacob before a rap check
Hundred karat chain and I ain't broke nan sweat
Busting down bricks and I don't need no check
Real D-boys with stacks on deck
Hummer and a Jacob before a rap check
Hundred karat chain and I ain't broke nan sweat
Busting down bricks and I don't need no check
Young Juiceman with stacks on deck

[Verse 1]
Thirty thousand dollar Hummer, I'm flexing on the industry
Right hand aqua blue, chain a hundred karat [?]
Busting down bricks, numbers doing trigonometry
Thirty inch round shoe, chrome Hummer [?]
Left hand nasty with a stupid fruity recipe
Drop a 62 and she whip back 93
Blue and white Jacob, the same color the '73
Prada shoe walking, in two minutes, I done spent a key
And that's 'fore for a rap check, dog, you understand me?
Young Juiceman and my donk got that candy
Blowing out the pound and this kush sent from Cali
Fifty bricks in: "Goddamn, Juice, you swagging"

[Hook]
Hummer and a Jacob before a rap check
Hundred karat chain and I ain't broke nan sweat
Busting down bricks and I don't need no check
Real D-boys with stacks on deck
Hummer and a Jacob before a rap check
Hundred karat chain and I ain't broke nan sweat
Busting down bricks and I don't need no check
Young Juiceman with stacks on deck

[Verse 2]
Sixty thousand dollar Jacob before a rap check
Busting down squares, posted on Bouldercrest
Right hand good, but I'm superb with my left
Pitching off the mound, but the curveball went left
Rapping in the industry, but I'm trapping for my wealth
Thirty thousand dollar Hummer, I catch it off the shelf
"How you do that there?" 'Cause I'm the number one chef
And I don't need no [?] 'cause it cook up by itself
Put me in the store, six dollars, all for sale
So Icey D-boss, put me on the scale
Young Juiceman and you know I'll make it rain
Bouldercrest posted with them blocks of that caine

[Hook]
Hummer and a Jacob before a rap check
Hundred karat chain and I ain't broke nan sweat
Busting down bricks and I don't need no check
Real D-boys with stacks on deck
Hummer and a Jacob before a rap check
Hundred karat chain and I ain't broke nan sweat
Busting down bricks and I don't need no check
Young Juiceman with stacks on deck

[Verse 3]
Three hundred strong 'fore I jumped off in this rap game
Told Ms. Deb one album'll buy an airplane
Big Gucc just chill, Gucc Troop, I got you, man
I got them stupid rubberbands, swagging on the industry

[Hook]
Hummer and a Jacob before a rap check
Hundred karat chain and I ain't broke nan sweat
Busting down bricks and I don't need no check
Real D-boys with stacks on deck
Hummer and a Jacob before a rap check
Hundred karat chain and I ain't broke nan sweat
Busting down bricks and I don't need no check
Young Juiceman with stacks on deck
