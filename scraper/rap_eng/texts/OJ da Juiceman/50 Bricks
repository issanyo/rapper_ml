[Hook x2]
50 bricks in the night dawg, I'm doin numbers
Bale and a half cuz, I'm doin numbers
Scale goin HAM dawg, I'm doin numbers
Ice around my neck cause I'm doin numbers

[Verse]
Wrist like Jordan, other like Kobe
Damn, I'm iced out dawg, what are you smoking?
Yung Juice Man, god dammit I'm fly
I got so many carats in my chicken pot pie
Diamond brick mason shawty cause I got weight
A hunnid bricks in, had the house by the lake
'72 donk, 24" roller skates
Man, I'm boomin off the chain, watch lookin like grapes
In a '07 Charger SRT8
Man, I bought it off the lot
Cuz, Juice dun pushed the weight
[?] connect dawg and it plugged with that cake
Chevy C10 popped and locked on them [?]
Eatin shrimp on a stick and it's heavy on the steak
Livin like a mobsta, choppin wit me patnas
In Benihana's dinin on calimari pasta
Bubba kush blowin like Yung Juice dun won a Oscar

[Hook x2]
50 bricks in the night dawg, I'm doin numbers
Bale and a half cuz, I'm doin numbers
Scale goin HAM dawg, I'm doin numbers
Ice around my neck cause I'm doin numbers

[Verse]
50 bricks in the night dawg, use a little muscle
Right hand cookin and my number triple-double
Sun Valley shawty and my dime look like numbers
Trappin with a choppa so the Juice don't fumble
Workin outta houses and it doin numbers
Swing my front door and it's pistol to your nostril
Brick man life got the Juice real hostile
Say the wrong thing and my goons gon drop ya
Still heavy trappin, had to switch the spots up
Cause a nigga like you dawg, spits it to the coppas
But it's 10 bales, 50 bricks so they can't stop us
32 E-N-T and we stay guapped up

[Hook x2]
50 bricks in the night dawg, I'm doin numbers
Bale and a half cuz, I'm doin numbers
Scale goin HAM dawg, I'm doin numbers
Ice around my neck cause I'm doin numbers

[Outro]
See this ice around my neck? Came from Juice sellin dope
And this ice around my pinky came from Jucie whippin coke
And I still fuck with Pepsi, but the Juice and the coke
I can make a half a mil dawg just sellin dope
I can make a whole mil off these words that I quote
Man, my bars is so freezin please bring Juice's coat
