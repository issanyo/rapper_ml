[Hook: OJ da Juiceman]
We got Now and Later cars, Froot Loop chains
Stupid fruity colors in our pinky rings
We got Now and Later cars, Froot Loop chains
Stupid fruity colors in our pinky rings
We got Now and Later cars, Froot Loop chains
Stupid fruity colors in our pinky rings
We got Now and Later cars, Froot Loop chains
Stupid fruity colors in our pinky rings

[Verse 1: OJ da Juiceman]
One is for the money and two is for the show
Three is for the ice that got me gliding on the floor
With stupid fruity colors, got me sliding in your hoe
I'm hopping out a Coupe with them swanga Lambo doors
Cadillac Escalade on them [?]
Two days out the week, I be cruising on a boat
With a Cuban plug and yes, I'm selling coke
Jewelry so sick that it'll keep me with a cold
Call me "Baby Beemer" 'cause I'm plugged with that dope
Or better yet, "Krispy Kreme", I'm posted with them O's
[?] on my feet, first album going gold
A real trapstar and I get it out the bowl
Young Juiceman with a swagger more than gold
They keep them damn groupies bobbing and jigging on they toes
Blue, black, yellow diamonds keep the Juice froze
And two-tone Charger sitting up on 24's

[Hook: OJ da Juiceman]
We got Now and Later cars, Froot Loop chains
Stupid fruity colors in our pinky rings
We got Now and Later cars, Froot Loop chains
Stupid fruity colors in our pinky rings
We got Now and Later cars, Froot Loop chains
Stupid fruity colors in our pinky rings
We got Now and Later cars, Froot Loop chains
Stupid fruity colors in our pinky rings

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci, nah ming
Crayola colored cars because I love to be seen
Purple thrax box Chevy, same color lean
My rims 26, but my bricks nineteen
Off white clear coat, same color Chlorine
Gold Catalina, same color Listerine
Your friend say she seen me in my Lamborghini
Blue, same color as the diamonds in my pinky
SpongeBob Charger, Elmo Sliverado
Alligator Acura, crocodile Tahoe
Two-door Chevelle, but these rims like a Lamb
And it urrt with a skrrt, got a cab and a Lamb
