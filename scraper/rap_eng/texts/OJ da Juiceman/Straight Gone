[Hook: Rico]
Lil Shawty got me straight gone
All up in my head
It's like I lost my mind in the bed
Shawty got me straight gone
Til these hoes don't see you now
I haven't seen them birds in a while
Since the warning shot you gave me I been spending every night with you
With you
Girl I swear it's so good I could play all night with you, with you

[Verse 1: OJ da Juiceman]
I'm gone, I'm throwed, my head fucked up off her
It's a go, oh no, I'm buying this bitch long furs
My mind is in the bed, where's my chauffeur?
All these diamonds on me got me colder than a polar bear
Yeah, diamond chandelier
Spending every night with you, tickets to my fair
One night only, was a one night affair
Humping in my bed, but we fucking in the chair
Smack her on her booty then I pulled her by her hair
Ain't seen her in a while so I showed her that I care

[Hook]

[Verse 2: OJ]
I found me a cutie, baby named Beauty
Cute in the face and she stupid in the booty
Standing like a diva
Might have been a stripper
I'm every night her, Juiceman tripping
I just want a tee-tee
Stones like pee-pee
Baby body colder, colder than a ice tray
Playground body, make Juice wanna play
Got Juice gone like I'm flying down the highway
Slip and slide pussy and it's running like a fountain
I'm racked up and my money tall as mountains
All these females, body like a diamond
I love me some girls cause they keep me rising

[Hook]

[Bridge: Rico]
Now fellas if you got a girl, and you need a one nighter
You say "can I have a tee-tee, can I have a tee-tee"
Ladies if you got a man that you feel uh
You only want a thriller
You say "boy you can have a tee-tee, you can have a tee-tee"
Now to all my ladies who got the best sex
Put your hands in the air and say "I got it, got it"
Now to all my ladies who do it like that
Put your hands in the air and say "I got it, gotcha"
