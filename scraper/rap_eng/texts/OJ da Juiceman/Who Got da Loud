[Verse 1: Lil Meta]
I love the L-O, U-D, strong pack, fruity
Smell like ooh-wee, sell your boy Q-P
I be at the QT, excuse me, BP
The QT hot, stay packed with some codeine
They on that Goose, shawty, everybody know me
Magnum on fours, balling like Kobe
Kush and a riller, jacob six-figure
.40 Cal on my side, yes, I'll kill ya
They call me Lil Meta, I'm that dude of the South
Got the Juiceman and the Juugman in the house
I smell purple kush, all through the crowd
So I need to know, who's got the loud?

[Hook: Lil Meta]
Who's got the loud? Who's got the loud?
Who's got the loud? Let me know who's got the loud

Loud, loud, loud, loud
Loud, loud, loud, loud

[Verse 2: OJ da Juiceman]
Loud pack, loud pack, AK-47
Loud pack in, make me pull a 211
'07 Magnum mounted on the stupid sevens
Blowing irate kush and in the sky like Heaven
Smoke a whole pound, that's that stupid mounts of seven
Prada shoe walking, me and your girl watching plasma
'68 Cutlass, skating on them stupid [?]
Metal [?] kush, you ain't 'round, buy seven
Ralph got the juug, Juiceman got the Santa
I got that loud pack, make it stank in East Atlanta
Goddamn, I'm booming
Young Juiceman, smoke the pounds of the fruity

[Hook: Lil Meta]
Who's got the loud? Who's got the loud?
Who's got the loud? Let me know who's got the loud

[Verse 3: Yung Ralph]
Mr. Purple Thrax, Mr. Bubble Kush
Obama shit, no more George Bush
I keep that loud pack, and you can smell mine
I'm smoking every bud, nah, I can't sell mine
Yung Ralph, OJ, and Lil Meta
Just three rats out here searching for some cheddar
What you need? I carryout and deliver
My bracelet make you sneeze, but my charm make you shiver
Yung Ralph, Cleveland Ave., king of the cheapest
Shouts out to my partner, king of the [?]
I smell purple kush, all through the crowd
So I need to know, is who's got the loud?

[Hook: Lil Meta]
Who's got the loud? Who's got the loud?
Who's got the loud? Let me know who's got the loud
You got the loud, he got the loud
