[Hook]
Early morning trapping, down to make it happen
Working 50 bricks, we bust them chickens out the plastic
Get them bitches gone, we call it dope boy magic
Pull up in that stanky thing, mane that thing nasty
Early morning trapping, down to make it happen
Working 50 bricks, we bust them chickens out the plastic
Get them bitches gone, we call it dope boy magic
Pull up in that stanky thing, mane that thing nasty

[Verse 1]
Early bird gets the worm, mane dog I'm trapping
50 bricks unwrap them bricks and bust them out the plastic
I'ma get this money, show you dope boy magic
Right hand cooking and my grams keep dancing
Pull up in my trap same color as a Chapstick (Burr!)
Working like Mickey D's, house crammed with them bricks
T'working 6 cellphones 'cause I'm out here getting rich
Pull up on my 'migo and he got them stupid stamped bricks
All white chickens like I'm in the country
Country boy coming, I sit tall, homie
Stupid bands and stupid rack, man, dog I got it
Swagging through the club, I got a rocket in my pocket (Young Juice)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Nasty whip is off the chain and my diamonds stupid bling
Pull up in that berry whip same color as ice cream (Young Juice)
Stupid watch and stupid chain my shit be retarded mane
Kicking shit like Jackie Chan but overseas like Gilligan
Tokyo and Russia diamonds got me spending Benjamins
Bald face hundreds, big face numbers
Loud pack blowing, I was blowing it for the summer
Walking with that green, make you think that I'm a farmer
Coca-Cola shawty, cooking on a Foreman
Pull up in my trap, whip same color a armpit
Walking with them gwallas, half a million on my home bitch
Young Juiceman, (?) on my arm bitch

[Hook]
