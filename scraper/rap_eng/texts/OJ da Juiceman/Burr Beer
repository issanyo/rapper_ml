(chorus)
I step up out the whip lookin like alaska frozen
Stupid icey stupid jewelry got me like a polar
Bear, yeah, like a cold beer AYE OK the crowd man they cheer
[2x]

I step up out the whip and im lookin like a igloo
Pinky ring stupid same colour as peekabu
Got them diamonds on an they yellow like pikachu
Loud stanky kush got me smellin like an onion booth
Working all these cell phones movin like king tut
Red and black charger lookin like pizza hut
Little bitty forty if ya snitchin make ya see her butt
All this jewelry on me got me lookin like im temperature
And im young juice so im workin like a chicken bruh

All this jewelry on me and im cookin in my kitchen boy
Give me that kushy and a lighter you know we is pimpin boy

(chorus)
I step up out the whip lookin like alaska frozen
Stupid icey stupid jewelry got me like a polar
Bear, yeah, like a cold beer AYE OK the crowd ya they cheer
[2x]

Polar bear diamonds icehouse earrings
Jungle gym necklace lookin like a freezee
Juice man chain an he screamin shoot point 3
Im in the paint and my diamonds like M J
Pop up out that whip and im lookin like a Canadian
Bangin white chain, lookin like a reverend
Way below zero, call me thug hero
If I catch you baby girl youll become a hero
Blue and red diamond shinin like a beacon
30,000 pinky got me sellin like the beatles
When I do a show yo it boostin up my ego
When I buy my chain I do impression of an eagle

(chorus)
I step up out the whip lookin like alaska frozen
Stupid icey stupid jewelry got me like a polar
Bear, yeah, like a cold beer AYE OK the crowd ya they cheer
