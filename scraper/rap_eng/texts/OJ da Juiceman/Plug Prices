[Hook: Young Scooter and OJ da Juiceman]
You could get a dose of this street shit
You could come and cop you a cheap brick
I got a spot you can pick your number at
Yeah, I got a number trap
I got plug prices, I got plug prices
I got plug prices, I got plug prices
I got-I got plug prices, I got plug prices
I got plug prices

[Verse 1: OJ da Juiceman]
I got plug prices, I'm talking low numbers
So much damn work, filled up 10 Hummers
Standing in the kitchen, call me baby Benihana
In my number trap, all we do is run through numbers
Like a calculator, all we do is add the commas
I got plug prices, tell the plug to keep 'em coming
100,000 bales of gas sent in from the homie
2 metric tons of fish scale wrapped up like a mummy
Get it to the Crest and we gone serve every junkie
When you in the streets for real everybody love ya'
Keep your eyes on the hoes, niggas, and the money
Keep your eyes on the hoes, niggas, and the money

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I just left Laredo, I got plug lices
I drive my own pack, I can't tell on myself
Sold 2600 pounds didn't need nobody's help
I got plug relations, plugged it with Haitians
Plugged up Jamaicans, I make big plays
Come get a dose of it, I can serve you different ways
The recipe to make a brick, I got 6 ways
600 hours, that's 600,000
I'm a real boss, I get it off
I jug, I loss
Pass 3 a cost, Freebandz boss
I plug talk
If I ever take a loss, nigga, I take you off

[Hook]

[Verse 3: OJ da Juiceman]
You can get a cheap brick of the remix
Atlantic Ocean waves, get sea sick
In a Ferrari see deodorant like a Speed Stick
I'm all about my bread, mozzarella cheese stick
You can get a dose of this real street shit
Pay a finder's fee, since I got to teach this
Pounds of gas going for the 36
Want a 36, then I charge you 26
