I do that shit, I do that shit, I move them pounds and them bricks
I do that shit, I do that shit, dimes and them damn nicks
I do that shit, I do that shit, sell wholes and sell splits
I do that shit, I do that shit, yeah, Young Juice, bitch

[Verse 1: OJ da Juiceman]
When I post up in your hood with them breakdown dimes
If a nigga try to jack, leave this thought on the grind
Disrespect my mind, then I'll dump a couple rounds
Headed straight for the border with them keys and the pounds
Hit my 'migo up, let him know I'm 'bout to [?]
With a stupid, stupid juug like Joc, it's going down
Multicolored chains, same color, orange mound
In the tractor trailer truck, same color as the pound
White girl in, so the trap all mine
Young Juiceman serving deuces and the dimes

[Hook: OJ da Juiceman]
I do that shit, I do that shit, I move them pounds and them bricks
I do that shit, I do that shit, dimes and them damn nicks

I do that shit, I do that shit, yeah, Young Juice, bitch
I do that shit, I do that shit, I move pounds and move bricks
I do that shit, I do that shit, dimes and them damn nicks
I do that shit, I do that shit, sell wholes and sell splits
I do that shit, I do that shit, yeah, Young Juice, bitch

[Verse 2: Bolo]
Full the pound, bust them down
You see that K? I'm busting rounds
See why you don't come around
They ain't sold on my side of town
Zone 6 [?] sound screeching for that chalkwork
Metro or that damn church, Pyrex make [?] jerk
At the club, hundreds on it
Ese got them bullets on him
That'll put you in a coma
Cookie coke, I hate the aroma
I done had a nice summer, 63 to 96
Every day, it leaves them [?]
My trap, they bunking, bitch
I ain't on no crazy shit
Pockets got them gwalla, bitch
Want some work? Then holla, bitch
Want some work? Then holla, bitch

[Hook: OJ da Juiceman]

[Verse 3: OJ da Juiceman]
Yeah, it's Young Juice and bitch, I do that shit
36 O's, 16 O's and yeah, I move it quick
Call me T-Mobile 'cause I'm always surfing
Cadillac EST, blowing on Urkel
Juice and Bolo with the mid and the purple
It's a lot of niggas, so it's a big circle
Raised on the 'Crest, so you know I'll murk you
And post up in your hood with the dimes and the workers
Donk on Davin and they paint it purple
Crazy color swag, hoes say, "Yeah" like Usher
Swing my door, not too hard, goons straight up rush you
Trap going crazy, got me iced like Busta
Riding, yeah, deuces and dimes
Wrist game retarded, I could give away a nine
