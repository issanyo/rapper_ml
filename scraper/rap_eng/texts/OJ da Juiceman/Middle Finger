[Hook:Oj Da Juiceman]
What Would I be without my pyrex and my clientele
Probably broke and disgusted dead or in jail
But with my right wrist I learned to cook fish
Focus in the game with one gold get rich
Get money, Stack papers, Middle fingers in the air to a hater
Get money stack papers middle finger in the air to a hater

[Verse1]
Wish a nigga would, Nigga wish he could
Me the Juiceman got work in every hood
But I stay down so I can wear the crown
Sucka nigga Hatin' pussy with a frown
You can join the circus cause I don't know this clown
Bouldercrest Road thats my stompin' ground
Shout out little Dre that nigga hold me down
32ENT. and we dont fuck around with no pussy nigga with no hatin nigga
With no sucka niggas yeah we from decatur nigga
Get some money nigga get a hustle nigga

H,H,H,H,H,H,H,Hi hater
Guess you mad cause my shoes is alligator
Everytime I step out yea juiceman look like he tailored
Blowin 93 RG3 we play for baylor
White and Blue polo Boy lookin' like a sailor
Kobe Bryant wrist like I just signed to the Lakers
Keep a shooter with me Reggie Miller from the Pacers
Go Go Gadget car plus they fast just like speed racer
Niggas hate on me blow my two pencils erase ya'
Swear I'm from Alaska cause my jewelry like a glacier
Came from the bottom to the top look how im raised up
Culinary art school yea I kept my grades up
