[Hook: Gorilla Zoe]
Ziplock (5x)
Doing numbers and they busting out the ziplock
Ziplock (4x)
Game in the air like I swear I got the shit locked

[Verse 1: OJ Da Juiceman]
Busting out the ziplock, trapped at the bus stop
Say you want a split [?] 9 mixed with re-rock
Damn, could’ve sold some Reebok
30 play jug, 30 [?]
At the Texaco , when that hood niggas dropped
In the Valley dog, with my fork in the pot
Full Nelson trap, headlock
Murk the trap, dead doc
Barney Rubble stones, Bedrock
Zips of the purp, head shots
50 dollar lines, making real top
Pee-Wee Herman diamonds, big top

[Bridge: Gorilla Zoe]
Drank lean by the zip, got the game locked
Every day I’m fresh like I popped up out a ziplock
Now your money keep them hundreds in a ziplock

[Hook: Gorilla Zoe]

[Verse 2: Gorilla Zoe]
A 32 I’m cooking out the crock pot
Juice just come say Zoe go check that drop box
100K, just drop it at the stash house
A thousand pounds of kush from 'migo, drop it off
I’m looking at a digit with six zeros
I swear to God that I was broke a week ago
Sold a million sent before BP bought Amoco
'Round the same time that Juice was at that Texaco
Smoking presidential, call my spot the white house
Got these J's chain smoking at the trap house
Trying to duck the feds ’cause they giving phone numbers off
Before them folks be pulling up, I swear to God I'm smashing off
