[Intro]
Chyeah
Aye
Ayyyyyye...

[Hook] (2x)
Standing at the stove, pockets green just like a toad
Straight drop fish but it jumping out the bowl
Electric or the gas, making bands off the stove (2x)

[Verse 1]
Standing at the stove, making bands off the stove, unh
Pockets on green 'cause I'm walking with a toad, unh
Bullfrog yay, yeah it's jumping out the bowl, aye
Hit it with the fork, now it's time to hit the road, aye
Keep a shooter with me, you can call him Derrick Rose, aye
Stove like gold, sweetest story never told, aye
Cleaners of the stove, open bricks and bust your nose, aye
Traphouse working, you can smell it through the do', aye
Nigga get a hundred years, the feds hit the do'
We ain't worried 'bout 'em, keep working, nigga move that dope, aye
Nigga keep gas like I own a Texaco, aye
1,008 grams got me standing at the stove, unh

[Hook] (2x)
Standing at the stove, pockets green just like a toad
Straight drop fish but it jumping out the bowl
Electric or the gas, making bands off the stove (2x)

[Verse 2]
Pockets green just like a toad, my 'migo sent the load
Standing at the stove, you can call it ghetto gold
Swing my front do' with a fully loaded pole
McDonald's trap, you pull up, get it then you go
Different flavored gas like I own a Texaco
Electric or the gas, making bands off the stove
My neck, ear, wrist and fit polar bear cold
Pillsbury money baby, all I get is dough
When you buying chickens, better check it 'fore you go
'Cause ain't no refund on it once it hit the do'
Made 7 figures just for standing at the stove
Gold mouth dog, 22 karat gold

[Hook] (2x)
Standing at the stove, pockets green just like a toad
Straight drop fish but it jumping out the bowl
Electric or the gas, making bands off the stove (2x)
