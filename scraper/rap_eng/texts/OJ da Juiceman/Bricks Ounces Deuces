[Hook : OJ Da Juiceman] (x2)

Bricks ounces deuces, my traffic goin stupid
Should hit a nigga phone if you looking for dem cookies
Bricks ounces, dueces, right hand stupid. Swing my front door and its bricks ounces dueces

[Verse 1 : OJ Da Juiceman]

I dropped a 62, and it did numbers
Chef seasoned salad pockets on cucumber
Lookin for dem chickens then hit a nigga number
First degree murder if that pussy wasn't workin
Ima keep it 100 got more chickens than churchs
But only serve a few coz this pussy nigga workin
Standin on the stove smokin big blunts of purple
Pyrex vision made my cookies into a circle
Knocks on my tail so i had to tighten my circle
Cut a couple niggas coz them niggas sweet like suckas
But im boulder crest, with some sun valley muscle, and i work too hard to get played by a busta!

[Verse 2 : OJ Da Juiceman]


36, all is lips, it came to lip but it ran so quick
Trap needle, man my money so long
Glass house, glass house so hit a nigga phone
Trap doin numbers man my house is goin ham
Get the coupe watch, give the J a whole gram
Known in the hood as the fuckin brick man
Gingerbread, gingerbread, yay white tan
Distribute that glass and the whole chick ran
Millionare mouthpeice, Trillionare hand
Splash that warm water watch that bitch do grams
I dont do no whip, im the straight drop man
Workin 6 cell phones and im off in these things
Bricks, ounces, deuces of pure cocain
Workin 6 cell phones and im off in these things
Bricks, ounces, deuces of pure cocain
