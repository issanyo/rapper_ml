I got xans' all in my sprite so I mix up (So I mix up)
I got money on my line so I pick (So I pick up)
I got work all in my pot so I mix up (So I mix up)
Unlocked (skkrt skkrt!)
I pull up, I pull up
Said money on my line so I pick up (So I pick up)
I got all these different colors in my cup (All in my cup)
I got gas, I got gas in my blunt (I got gas)
Said it's money on my line, I pick up (I pick up)

[Verse 1 - OJ Da Juiceman]
Watch me do a magic trick, pull up on them lipstick
Way I work my wrists could've been in gymnastics
Baby seen the coupe, missing roof, thought it was plastic
Killed the dope game, left the stove in the casket
Damn! Ay, yeah I made it happen
Just a gold bound
But yeah I got that gas in
Ten dollar grams nigga
Try to get my ass in
Fucking with the team 'dem I can do some magic
Rollie on my right wrist and the diamonds dancing
71' Chevrolet and that bitch is nasty
Skkrt skrrt in the pot, now I got them grams in
32 ENT we trapping or we rapping?

[Verse 2 - CEEJ]
Anything I want man yeah you know that I can get it
F.L.Y that [?] piece that swag Mr [?]
Said that 58' Chevy Bel Air, I never do the Bentley
[?] out to Boulder Crest I got that whole 6 with me
And I'm feeling just like Biggie on the stoop
Right to my brother kid I spend it then recoup
I got money on my line and I pick up every time
Since '09 I've been Two-9 and we stay true, we stay true
(Stay true, more than ever I'm in the 6 right know
In Miami chasing base, they mixing lean right now
Pop the [?] bite down, money on me now
Ice up on me now
Counting green right now)
