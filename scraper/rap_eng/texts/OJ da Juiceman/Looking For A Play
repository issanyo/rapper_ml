[Intro]
Hahaha, ahh
Chyeah
Doo doo
Yeah yeah, unh...

[Hook] (2x)
Say I woke up early morning, I'm just looking for a play
Answer my phone at 8 AM, I'm just tryna catch a play
If you see Young Juice out early, I'm just looking for a play
I'm just looking for a play, I'm just tryna catch a play

[Verse 1]
Answer my phone at 8 AM, young nigga wanna make a whole zip
Yeah I make the fish jumping like Blake Griffin, so you know a nigga balling out the gym
Trapper of the year, neck on chill, got bricks like Shaquille O'Neal
Keep that steel, sticks and Glocks, nigga hard to kill
Dope hold so much water, I think it gon' need a bib (Skrrt!)
I just whipped a baby so I babysit the kids (Skrrt!)
Nigga tried to rob so I hit him with the six
Bouldercest nigga but I do it real big (Valley)
Gas pack shawty, Tony Bandz gon' work the mid (Yessir)
Up early morning, I'm just tryna get it in (Yessir)
Six cellphones, in the pot I whirlwind
Posted with the white girl, that's my girlfriend (Aye!)

[Hook] (2x)

[Verse 2]
Hit it with the spatula
My wrist game spectacular
Your hoe suck me like Dracula
My diamonds like some wrestlers
Rope on top of rope, I'm the hood ghetto Pope
And I came from selling dope, give all my young niggas
In the streets it ain't no joke, fuck around and get smoked
Get your whole family whacked for a quarter key of dope
Nigga post up at the store, we got more dope so we roll
And got more kush we gon' blow, never know who friend or foe
So I'm early morning trapping, first young nigga at the store
I know six young niggas and they down for a kick door
Sticks and bandanas and you know we play cutthroat
[?] bricks [?] taco

[Hook] (2x)
Say I woke up early morning, I'm just looking for a play
Answer my phone at 8 AM, I'm just tryna catch a play
If you see Young Juice out early, I'm just looking for a play
I'm just looking for a play, I'm just tryna catch a play

[Verse 3]
Woke up early, answer my phone, brush my teeth and then I'm gone (Skrrt!)
Gotta catch a jug, young nigga say he want four zones
So I pulled up on him quickly, call me Get It On Jones
Just a gold mouth dog, I'm just looking for a bone
Went from standing on the corner, now a nigga buying homes
In 1998, young Juiceman had a big bomb
Standing on the top, now [?] tip of the thumb
Then we moved to Brooke Lake and I start working off my phone
Learnt how to cook then I took it to the bowl
Jumped off the porch then I went at got more golds
Went to the gym and I posted at the store
So I'm out early morning, I got plays on my phone

[Hook] (2x)
Say I woke up early morning, I'm just looking for a play
Answer my phone at 8 AM, I'm just tryna catch a play
If you see Young Juice out early, I'm just looking for a play
I'm just looking for a play, I'm just tryna catch a play
