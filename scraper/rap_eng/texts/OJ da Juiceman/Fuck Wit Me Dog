[Hook](x2)
Smoking on the kushy, rolling up the Barney
Posted in the hood shining, make the hoes horny
Unh, fuck with me dog
Unh, now fuck with me dog

[Verse 1]
Hot summer day and Juice smoking kushy
Chilling in my hood dog and the J's thirsty
VVS chain got your main looking thirsty
Bouldercrest shawty, swagged up everyday
Fit looking right, cut looking right
Call up the boys, man we stepping out tonight
When the show out of town, take the first class flight
When the show in the city, you know we put on right?
32 ENT got the limelight
Customized Breitling ring got me shining bright
'72 donk, dog, with the loud packs
Smoking on the kushy, living my life
Young Juiceman and I'm shining like a light
Ring looking right, watch looking right
Might as well say I live a VVS life
32 ENT, we put on right?

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 2]
Fuck with me, baby fuck with me
We can be together like Ray J and Whitney
Throw some 24's on an offset Bentley
Girl you know I'm good from the years of the trapping
(?) stay down and the country boy taxing
Girl life's good, man I stay capping
Young Juiceman and my wrist so nasty
Pulled to your crib, baby let's do the nasty
She didn't want nothing but some brand new mattress
Stupid fye head game so I made it happen
It ain't even phase me 'cause I stay trapping
Bubba Kush blowing, (?)

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 3]
Barney, Barney, yeah we serving Barney
Barney, Barney, we stay smoking Barney
Purple outfit, looking like Barney
Kush stay blowing counting up the hundreds
In the club weekly, throwing up the money
In the club balling, you see me stunting
In the hood posted, getting to the money
Ghetto hoes love it, trap girls want it
Young Juiceman gotta keep the girls horny
Throwing up the deuces when you see me coming
(?) cause I'm getting money
Young Juiceman, ain't a damn thing funny
