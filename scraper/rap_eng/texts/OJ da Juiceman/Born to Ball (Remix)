Say you getting money? I don't see it, dog
See my 26's? Yeah, they standing real tall
And my chain, yeah, it's heavy as a bowling ball
I'm the number one stunna, I was born to ball
Say you getting money? I don't see it, dog
See my 26's? Yeah, they standing real tall
And my chain, yeah, it's heavy as a bowling ball
I'm the number one stunna, I was born to ball

[Verse 1: Big Stacksss]
I was born to ball, you can call me Barry Bonds
Two minutes in the club, done threw away a thousand ones
Two years in the game, done hit over a thousand runs
Fifteen in the street, done sold over a thousand tons
I got bread, dog, you can call it Wonderloaf
Your bitch in the club sending me a love note
Then she sucking on my dick like a tugboat
I love money, but I can't live with my deep throat
Money come and go like my ex-girlfriends
Niggas on my dick, they like the way my wheels spin
Chain on my back, about to start a new trend
My money lonely, but it got over a million twins

[Verse 2: OJ da Juiceman]
Man, my chain heavy; it's, like, stupid, dog
I got stupid gwap, chain swing through the mall
And my diamonds, dog? VVS froze
Chain doing numbers, same pound bowling balls
Stupid fruity wrist game got me balling, y'all
Maserati Coupe, top gone [?]
And I'm getting money, so the Juice was born to ball
Pinky ring big like I played some basketball
Hummer H2, 30 inches, standing tall
'72 donk same color as the [?]
Kush blunt, dog, and we call it that loud
Young Juiceman make Bouldercrest proud

[Verse 3: Big Stacksss]
Enough bricks at the door to build a mailbox
I had the bird flu, now I got the chicken pox
Twenties in the back, looking like some Corn Pops
Foreign bitch and she sucking on my Cyclops
Flash my bankroll and make you look real hard
Rolled three bricks up, but selling you niggas all hard
Big Stacksss my name, jewelry game's insane
Yeah, I make it rain, check out my whip game
Bank account big, looking like a phone number
Fishscales turning flips like a Olympic tumbler
All bass making moves like a long jumper
A lot of bricks of snow, it's about to be a cold summer
