[Hook]
In the trap back at it, all I know is mathematics
Keep that clean fish scale, chickens bust up out the wrapper
2008, Juiceman turned into a rapper
Coming down the road with them bricks in a camper
Flying down the Crest, bricks in my daughter Pamper
Zone 6 nigga right here in East Atlanta
Keep them Hefty bags, nigga you can call me Santa
Small fry nigga, you'll never be on my level

[Verse 1]
Hater get on my level, bricks come in on schedule
Dancing with the devil ever since I was in Pampers
Georgia Baptist born but I was raised in East Atlanta
Zone 6 nigga still trapping with them blammers
Out here serving Dirty Diana, got keys just like pianos
In the kitchen cooking Hannah, make a hater turn the channel
Mississippi mud but my name not David Banner
In it for a bag, you can keep the fame and glamour
Run bricks like Deon Saunders
My name they wanna slander
32 ENT and the feds wanna ban us
Born in the trap but they just don't understand us
Grew up with the boys but half of 'em jealous

[Hook]
In the trap back at it, all I know is mathematics
Keep that clean fish scale, chickens bust up out the wrapper
2008, Juiceman turned into a rapper
Coming down the road with them bricks in a camper
Flying down the Crest, bricks in my daughter Pamper
Zone 6 nigga right here in East Atlanta
Keep them Hefty bags, nigga you can call me Santa
Small fry nigga, you'll never be on my level

[Verse 2]
Swim team wrist when I'm cooking fish
Catch me in the kitchen, nigga I can serve a dish
Plug throw the rock, Chris Paul, I assist
Slam like Blake, damn near broke my wrist
Posted in the trap, in the yard is some fish
Say I got it from rap, nah nigga, it was bricks
'Cause the J's love the rocks and the niggas love to sniff
Smoking up the gas, [?] we call it piff
Feeling like Tony, got my name on a blimp
Shout out to Memphis, got Young Juiceman feel like pimps
Caught me slipping once, got Young Juiceman with a limp
Hundred rack donk, 20 bands for the rims

[Hook]
In the trap back at it, all I know is mathematics
Keep that clean fish scale, chickens bust up out the wrapper
2008, Juiceman turned into a rapper
Coming down the road with them bricks in a camper
Flying down the Crest, bricks in my daughter Pamper
Zone 6 nigga right here in East Atlanta
Keep them Hefty bags, nigga you can call me Santa
Small fry nigga, you'll never be on my level

[Verse 3]
Shouts out to my baby Chloe
Yeah, that's my homie
Nigga, run up on we
His family be lonely
I'ma act a donkey
Banana with the monkey
In a stolen car but I'm riding with a junkie
Mask on like a hockey with some military functions
Going out 'bout mine, I ain't dying bout no fuck shit
Grab the sniper and say fuck it
Go and steal a bucket
Then [?], ending all that fuck shit
These choppas, you can't duck it
You better not try to truck it
You ain't Usain Bolt so you better not buck it
I'ma keep it real, I'm that nigga not to fuck wit
Treat your head like a brick, boy you 'bout to get it busted

[Hook]
In the trap back at it, all I know is mathematics

Small fry nigga, you'll never be on my level
