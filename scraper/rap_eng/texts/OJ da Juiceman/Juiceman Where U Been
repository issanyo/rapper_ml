Juiceman where you been? I been selling dope
Juiceman you been chilling? I been rocking coke
Nah, Juiceman ain't been chilling, I been getting money
Riding 'round Dekalb County serving all the junkies

[Verse 1]
Trapping in Dekalb County, I been getting money
Capping next to Texaco and still serve the junkies
With this brown paper bag, filled with [?] make my money
Brown color Hummer, bought it off that zombie money
36 and 16 baby got me seeing money
Stay away from police nigga, don't you be no dummy
All my bricks are Wonder Woman, I can't do the gummy
Super A1, have my traphouse super bunkin'
30 racks a chicken got my cell phone super jumpin'
Money counter machine and it helps me count the hundreds
Rubberband a thousand hundreds racks, we kept it coming
Call me brick salute me cause we drunk for the money
Laughing at these ducks 'cause these suckers get no money
In the kitchen posted but my right hand doing the turning
Over the stove cooking but the yams ain't burning
Grant, Jackson, Franklin, yeah, Juiceman dog, he earning

Cap on 12, my nigga, you better bail, my nigga
You got a gun, my nigga, you better run, my nigga
Because we bomb, my nigga, hold your tongue, my nigga
If you squeal, lil nigga, then you done, lil nigga
Man I'm back up on my trap shit, lame can't get no doubt, bitch
And I'm rocking with the strap, tell me where the business is
You can get a 36 or you can hit the kill switch
Kill your self then kill your family, nigga that's how we deal with you
You don't see the bigger picture? Hit your girl with dill pickle
[?] 36 I get them off
Uncut clean super fish, known to numb a nigga jaw
This one for the snorters and that knot we keep that super wop
Mini .223, in the trap, we take this shit to war
If your body come up stinkin', Juiceman never sees a corpse
Guacamole city money nigga is my fuckin' sport
