[Intro: Bloody Jay]
Juiceman, huh
Bloody
81, 32

[Hook: Bloody Jay]
I got on real diamonds
VVS diamonds
She a dime, get her diamonds
In Miami, in that Diamonds
I got on real diamonds
VVS diamonds
She a dime, get her diamonds
In Miami, in that Diamonds

[Verse 1: OJ da Juiceman]
VVS in water, I just slaughtered your daughter
I got on real diamonds, nigga, your shit looking boring
Twenty-three chains on, call me Michael Jordan
Your fugazi chain you got on, your diamonds is snoring
ABG and 32, young niggas know we scoring
If she is a dime, we dodging sections and I enjoyed it
80K on my wrist with a flooded out Rollie
Used to have a blue and red chain diamond like police
Niggas run up on me, I'm quick to shoot like I'm Kobe
.40 Cal extended clip, you know I keep that .30
Bouldercrest Road, nigga, plus I sell the birdies
32 ENT, chickens for Juli Erving

[Hook: Bloody Jay]
I got on real diamonds
VVS diamonds
She a dime, get her diamonds
In Miami, in that Diamonds
I got on real diamonds
VVS diamonds
She a dime, get her diamonds
In Miami, in that Diamonds

[Verse 2: Bloody Jay]
The T called from jail, said he wanna see me grinding
So I went and bought more diamonds
Pieces disturbing the peace
Diamonds Dallas Page, DDP
I'ma get it to these niggas, ABG
My next free check, I'ma flood the AP
Chickens on my neck, Alicia Keys
Try to rob me, you'll get [?] then beat
You'll get beat, Dre
Hit him up for his ice cubes, today was a good day
I feel like PrimeTime on Draft Day
It's LL Bool J

[Hook: Bloody Jay]
I got on real diamonds
VVS diamonds
She a dime, get her diamonds
In Miami, in that Diamonds
I got on real diamonds
VVS diamonds
She a dime, get her diamonds
In Miami, in that Diamonds
