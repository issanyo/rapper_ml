[Intro]
Old school
I'm in too
It's young Juice

[Chorus]
Old school cars and they painted with that candy
Twenty four inches, whip outstanding
Old school cars and they paint is candy
Twenty six inches, whip outstanding
Old school cars and they painted with that candy
Twenty eight inches, car outstanding
Old school cars and they painted with that candy
Thirty inches, whip outstanding

[Verse 1]
Texaco Cutlass, Burger King Magnum
'71 Nova, had it painted platinum
Brown and black Charger, just like my father
Stoopid funky motor like I robbed Wells Fargo
Could've bought a Benz but I bought a Murcielago
'72 Caprice, same color as the cargo
'88 Impala, twenty six inch Dropos
Red, white, and blue painted on my Monte Carlo
Tennessee tints, same color as the charcoal
Petro, craze up, living like Pablo
Purple in the kush, got me on the throttle
Been getting money so Juice pop bottles

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Swordfish Chevy, mounted on fours

Juice rep Georgia but sound like thirty fours
'86 SS and it's on eights
Swerving down the 'Crest, smoking on grapes
Five whole chickens got Juice straight
Ten bails of great grape, now life's great
'72 donk same color as the lake
Stoopid color chain, same color as the jake
'92 'Burban sitting on eights
Funyun Cutlass on Davin skates
Pontiac Catalina, call it Corn Flakes
Twenty bands spent on that stoopid color paint

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
'74 Obbo mounted with the skirts
Flying in my hood no top, no shirts
Thirty two SS, can't you smell the birds?
Six four's cooking so you know we got work
Catch me bouncing through your hood, Zone 6 in the sky
Trapaholic dog, man I'm still serving cream pies
Bouldercrest shawty, all about them dead green guys
'07 'Lac truck mounted on them old guys
'82 Regal same color as the tie-dye
'84 Malibu, had it painted Popeye's
'71 Chevelle red and orange like apartment fires
'62 Camaro black and blue like marina watch

[Chorus]
