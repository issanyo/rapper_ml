[Hook] (2x)
My donk look like Halloween (2x)
26 inch Forgiatos, black and orange like Halloween
My donk look like Halloween (2x)
26 inch Forgiatos, black and orange like Halloween

[Verse 1]
Pull up, whip like Krispy Kreme
Yeah, young Juiceman keep that clean
'71 with the skirts, looking like it's Halloween
Twin turbo 572, my shit, it done grew some wings
Then I copped the '72, had to paint that bitch codeine
Hundred thousand dollar ones, I call them bitches street machines
Pull up on them Forgiatos, boy you know I killed the scene
Tony Tiger '71, racer fuel like bubble gum
50 racks under the hood, this engine is 1 to 1
Short locker [?], 10 bands on rack [?]
And this donk that I be in, catch me on ESPN
Slam dunking in my donk, Halloween trick or treatin'
Get your bitch on these Forgies,  now she gone for the weekend

My donk look like Halloween (2x)

[Verse 2]
'71 painted 31st, '71 donk killed 'em, put 'em in a hearse
All these rack spent in this car so I had to put his ass in this verse
'69 442 is a 'vert, nigga try to steal, li'l nigga get murked
Very strong motor, boy you know it had to "Errk!"
572, big boy, high torque
How you get the '71? Bought it off the fork porch
Run into the J's soon as I jumped off the porch
Smoking up the gas, young nigga need a torch
Halloween donk, 26 inch Forgies
Alligator seats [?]
[?] boy you know I get it burr berry
Freddy Kruger drop, got these niggas all scary
Chasing after cheese like Tom did Jerry
'72 donk, had the bitch painted berry
Inside looking like strawberry belly
Bitch on the side look like Halle Berry
Super Bowl pockets loaded with this fetty
Try to rob the donk, knock out your spaghetti
Smashing on the gas line Andre [Petty?]
All this money but the motor too heavy
572 screaming out "Let's get it"
