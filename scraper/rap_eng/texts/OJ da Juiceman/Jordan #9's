[Verse] Got the trap beatin like a fuckin alpine. Got everybody shoppin like they Jordan #9's
Mcdonald trap I got a very long line. Roll a 36, it's 1200 every ounce
Ain't gone play with ya cause this dope is known to bounce
20 hold a 80 but it's still that power house. Drop it in the pot, keep the Jay woke like a owl
Double 36 every single damn hour
Ran out of soda so i remixed it with flour
He don't get no strange, cuz that pussy he a coward
He know if he play, them sticks gone have a shower
Wet em up good, he don't need a towel


[Hook] They say i been selling bricks for a long time
Mcdonald trap it got a very long line
Got everybody shopping like they Jordan #9's

Baskin robbin trap, man i got 32 flavors
Blowin on da gas, but we a call this shit the lakers
[????] On the Bentley, tint lookin like the mayor
Fruity louis lens but i can't see no haters
All i see is green cuz I'm chasing after the paper
This nigga that i trust, man that sucka caught the vapors

Bouldercrest mound, Young Juiceman he the picture



[Hook] They say i been selling bricks for a long time
Mcdonald trap it got a very long line
Got everybody shopping like they Jordan #9's
I keep that fish scale cuz i got that cali pine. X2
