[Hook]
I went from standing on the corner to busting down bricks
Young Juiceman, cuz, serving babies and nicks
I'ma get this money or whatever it's gon' take
And post up in your trap with the pounds and the weight
I went from standing on the corner to busting down bricks
Young Juiceman, cuz, serving babies and nicks
I'ma get this money or whatever it's gon' take
And post up in your trap with the pounds and the weight

[Verse 1]
Now, ever since a youngin', all I've been around is money
Post up on the curb and catch all the junkies
With straight drop whip, I had the apartment doing numbers
Man, I ran that shit up in, like, five to six summers
Moved to the store and I was still knocking numbers
Bomb in the bushes, hot dogged them out of hunger
Worked out the yard, red dog called from [?]
With the [?], dog, they tried to take me under
I shook them haters off like Fred and Barney Rubble
Put me on probation 'cause they know I mean trouble
Young Juiceman and my neck is like a jungle
Just bought a Maserati off the pounds, bricks, and bundles
Man, I got so much money, man, I just might buy a Zonda
With a house on the hill, bought it just for my momma
And my nephew thirteen, you know I caught the Hummer
With so many bricks and my dimes look like numbers

[Hook]
I went from standing on the corner to busting down bricks
Young Juiceman, cuz, serving babies and nicks
I'ma get this money or whatever it's gon' take
And post up in your trap with the pounds and the weight
I went from standing on the corner to busting down bricks
Young Juiceman, cuz, serving babies and nicks
I'ma get this money or whatever it's gon' take
And post up in your trap with the pounds and the weight

[Verse 2]
Now, in this street life, man, they come with crazy rules
If you don't carry a torch, then you get your ass [?]
That's why Young Juice stay connected with them tools
I can't see no other way, put my picture on the news
That's why I stay ten toes in these Prada shoes
Man, I came a long way from eating chicken noodle soup
Now it's calamari baked with a touch of mango fruit
Young Juiceman, cuz, and my swag so true
It's 50K a night, toed my bitch in Jimmy Choos
Man, I'm balling off the chain and to you bitches, what it do?
My wrist and neck is so frozen, walking ice cube
Now, every day I wake up, it's a good day like Cube
And if I treat you a bird, all you get is ocean blue
Man, I'm flying in the donk, four inches plus two
With a stupid color swag, dark navy times two
Young Juiceman, cuz, Bouldercrest nigga, what it do?

[Hook]
I went from standing on the corner to busting down bricks
Young Juiceman, cuz, serving babies and nicks
I'ma get this money or whatever it's gon' take
And post up in your trap with the pounds and the weight
I went from standing on the corner to busting down bricks
Young Juiceman, cuz, serving babies and nicks
I'ma get this money or whatever it's gon' take
And post up in your trap with the pounds and the weight

[Verse 3]
Now, to my D-boys working out the spots
Be careful, dog, 'cause them snitches done made it hot
Man, they hating on you, dog, 'cause you got them stupid knots
But soon as that nigga slip, man, hit him with the dot
Then back to the trap, making gwalla, gwalla knots
Man, I think like a robber, nigga, always trying to plot
While I'm riding on eight, trying to dodge them crooked cops
But you pushed the wrong button, so the roof [?]
Now I'm in the concrete jungle with the pounds and the blocks
Lions, tigers, bears, yeah, I keep them in the stock
Channel 61 every time the Juice walk
Man, it's five bands flat every time the Juice talk
And I'm smoking bubble kushy, three hundred for a quart
And a deucey for a stack, that's how money walk
And I came from the corner, so I guess that's corner talk
Young Juiceman, cuz, with a pot and a fork
