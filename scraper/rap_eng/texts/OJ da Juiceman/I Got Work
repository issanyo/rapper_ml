[Chorus]
In the kitchen once again
I done gave the dope a (?)
Quarter brick, half a brick, tell me what you wanna spend
Half a pound, whole pound, even plugged in with the mid
Thousand pills and thousand seals
Fuck you niggas, come again
I got work (work, work, work, work)
I got work (work, work, work, work)
I got work (work, work, work, work)
I got work (work, work, work, work)
I got work

[Verse 1]
80 baby crazy
In this kitchen with Patrick Swayze
And the yay is dirty dancing
And it's white like Marilyn Manson, nigga
I just bought a mansion way before some rap advances
Michael Jackson with the work 'cause I make the J's start dancing
All this guacamole, got my pants on MC Hammer
Smoking on the gas like a nigga got cancer
They say bands a make her dance, so I turned her to a dancer
(?) with the bags,  got me riding on Prances
Freddie sent the gas but the bricks from cousin Hector
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, a couple schedules
Prada head to toe, so I'm dancing with the devil
NASA with the swag, something like a space shuttle
Rock band drums, so I'm blasting heavy metal
32 Ent, we got keys just like piano
All my young nigga with me, using sticks and bandannas
All my young nigga around me, using sticks and bandannas

[Chorus]
In the kitchen once again
I done gave the dope a (?)
Quarter brick, half a brick, tell me what you wanna spend
Half a pound, whole pound, even plugged in with the mid
Thousand pills and thousand seals
Fuck you niggas, come again
I got work (work, work, work, work)
I got work (work, work, work, work)
I got work (work, work, work, work)
I got work (work, work, work, work)
I got work

[Verse 2]
Dirty shoe walking
Put a hole in your head like a dolphin, nigga
J wanna hit Kenny Lofton, nigga
No apple, got sauce young nigga
Hit yo' baby mama with the long dill pickle
Jewelry look like a cold icicle
Came a long way from (?)
With Pollo and then with Hillfiger
Finger fuck the money with my trigger finger
You know I keep white like that nigga Justin Bieber
Made the birds sing like a R&B singer
Posted in the trap with a brand new Fisker
Brand new paint looking like wet pussy
Bouldercrest nigga with the bomb and them bushes
Call me (?), gotta keep them cookies
(?) bright to all gold Rollie
Sixteen gold, twenty two carat trophy
2014 Corvette on Forgis
All this trap money (?)
Pounds of the white, you can call a nigga Tony
Trap with the testament, judgement Rollie
Turn up, turn up, them I done roll it
If it ain't gas, you know I don't smoke it
If it ain't a thirty, you know I ain't toting it
Thirty one shots so you know my clip loaded
Quick to slam a nigga like a fur named Kobe
Shouts out to my fur dawg named Chloe
(?) dollar named baby girl Courtney
Pockets on green, so I'm walking with a Breitling
You know i keep a Glock like my nigga Charlie Barkley
Damn, yo girl head sure is sloppy
Kinco swag cause these fuck niggas copy

[Chorus]
In the kitchen once again
I done gave the dope a (?)
Quarter brick, half a brick, tell me what you wanna spend
Half a pound, whole pound, even plugged in with the mid
Thousand pills and thousand seals
Fuck you niggas, come again
I got work (work, work, work, work)
I got work (work, work, work, work)
I got work (work, work, work, work)
I got work (work, work, work, work)
I got work
