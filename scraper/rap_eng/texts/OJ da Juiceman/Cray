[Intro]
I got bricks in the 'frigerator, bales in the closet
Pills in the cabinet, known to make a profit
I got bricks in the 'frigerator, bales in the closet
Pills in the cabinet, known to make a profit
Sitting in the trap, going goddamn cray (2x)

[Bridge]
Chyeah, Aye...
Juiceman in this motherfucker, yessir
Chyeah
Aye...

[Hook] (2x)
I got bricks in the 'frigerator, bales in the closet
Pills in the cabinet, known to make a profit
Sitting in the trap, going goddamn cray (2x)

[Verse 1]
Sitting in the trap, going goddamn cray
I got pills, I got bags, I got goddamn babies
Standing over the stove cooking fish just like a sailor
Got your baby girl [?]
I got all kind of drugs, I can serve you like a waiter
I'm quick with the rock, some like Dion Waders
And this black and gray strap got me feeling the Raiders
Bales in the closet overprotected by them lasers
This .44 Bulldog turn a hater to a vapor
While these bricks coming in, still serving in Decatur
Money count machine had to help me count this paper
[?], we'll call them hoes the Lakers

[Hook] (2x)
I got bricks in the 'frigerator, bales in the closet
Pills in the cabinet, known to make a profit
Sitting in the trap, going goddamn cray (2x)

[Verse 2]
Refrigerator burr-y, got right wrist like Katy Perry
When I get it to the Crest, young Juiceman dump 'em in a hurry
Plug done passed the rock, got assist like Stephen Curry
Got some pills all in the cabinet known to keep your vision blurry
And I'm drinking up the lean, bricks in a Saleen
[?] Sunday clean, got straps like the A-Team
Cinnabon drum, silence [?]
With my wrist in the pot, got me looking Kareem
Sitting in the trap, nonstop like a machine
Front door, back door (3x) [?]
I just want it all, nigga love to hear that ping (2x)

[Hook] (2x)
I got bricks in the 'frigerator, bales in the closet
Pills in the cabinet, known to make a profit
Sitting in the trap, going goddamn cray (2x)
