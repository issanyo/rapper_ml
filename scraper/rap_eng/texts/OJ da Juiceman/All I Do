[Hook] (2x)
All I do is serve some J's
All I do is catch some plays
All I do is cook some yay
Smoking gas that's from the bay
All I do is get some money (4x)

[Verse 1]
All I do is get some money
Trap in rain, snow or sunny
Blue hundred, call me Sonic
I got bricks hid in the [?]
Catching plays [?]
Every stick, it hold a hundred
'88 SS, you can hear the motor humming
Selling white like Playboy bunnies
I'ma go and get the money
Cut them off, now ain't no fumbling
Still love to serve a junkie
Cook a 4 then drop a hundred
Skrrt (3x) then get the money
Cook a 4 then drop a hundred
Skrrt (3x), get all the money
I just cooked a whole chicken, that's a 36
Whipped them into zips, broke 'em down to nicks (Whoa)
Still selling white, same color grits
Standing in the kitchen and I'm cooking fish

[Hook] (2x)
All I do is serve some J's
All I do is catch some plays
All I do is cook some yay
Smoking gas that's from the bay
All I do is get some money (4x)

[Verse 2]
Every day, try to win win
See through glass like a bottle of gin
Hell nah, can't fuck with them
I got weight like in a gym
When it snow, I trap in Timbs
Still see me at the [?]
Lipstick all on my rims
Still shooting it out with them
Black Draco with the stem
Cooking fish, no fin
Love to trap, I'm dead in
Burglar boy, let's get it in
Tryna dodge the damn pin
I'm a fool with the pen
I'ma tell it like it is
Ain't gon' sugarcoat shit
No salt shake me, not around me
I can't fuck with you, you ain't bulletproof
Same folks made your strap made mine, too
Dripping with this sauce, that's why they call me Juice

[Hook] (2x)
All I do is serve some J's
All I do is catch some plays
All I do is cook some yay
Smoking gas that's from the bay
All I do is get some money (4x)
