[Hook]
I'm posted in the kitchen and I'm whipping babies
Rap game easy, but the dope game gravy
I'ma bust down them chickens, run them bands up
All my D-boys with me, let's run them grams up
I'm posted in the kitchen and I'm whipping babies
Rap game easy, but the dope game gravy
I'ma bust down them chickens, run them bands up
All my D-boys with me, let's run them grams up

[Verse 1]
Early afternoon and the Juice still cooking
Half a brick sold from me standing in the kitchen
Fifty brick order, twenty-one for the chicken
Gold grill, dog, but the Juice don't kick it
Riding something new, but the donk look exquisite
One man army in order to get that ticket
Riding with a bomb 'cause the Juice gotta get it
Don't hang with no niggas 'cause them niggas known to kick it
Born by myself, so I'ma die by myself
Just label me, the Juice, the number one chef
I'ma make this money 'til my very last breath
And I'ma keep working 'til there ain't no work left

[Hook]
I'm posted in the kitchen and I'm whipping babies
Rap game easy, but the dope game gravy
I'ma bust down them chickens, run them bands up
All my D-boys with me, let's run them grams up
I'm posted in the kitchen and I'm whipping babies
Rap game easy, but the dope game gravy
I'ma bust down them chickens, run them bands up
All my D-boys with me, let's run them grams up

[Verse 2]
The rap game easy, the dope game gravy
That's why I do both 'cause I get that paper
Thirteen years in, thirteen hundred for a baby
Racks for the nine, the prices are amazing
Pills for the low, that's why my trap blazing
Break down dimes, got me smoking like some bacon
Different trap spots still crowded like Central Station
Want a 31? Hit my phone and say, "Tracy"
Donk on daddy and the paint steady glazing
Five cell phones 'cause I'm paper chasing
Ten toes down and I'm watching for the haters
Niggas try the Juice, bust his head like mashed potatoes

I'm posted in the kitchen and I'm whipping babies
Rap game easy, but the dope game gravy
I'ma bust down them chickens, run them bands up
All my D-boys with me, let's run them grams up
I'm posted in the kitchen and I'm whipping babies
Rap game easy, but the dope game gravy
I'ma bust down them chickens, run them bands up
All my D-boys with me, let's run them grams up
