Im so big dawg too big to hit the mall up
Chain so big dawg make you put your shit up
Rims so big man it bout to tear the curb up
Her ass so big she could prolly sweep the floor up

Verse
Floor up , to up, diamond look like throw up
Big ass circle diamond chain, same size as a donut
Sun valley shawty wit a boulder crest diploma
Motor super strong you tap out just like homer
Bust my rims on the curb ,my tires smell like ammonia
In the mall a ball, but id rather play them corners
Im too big now , 32 for my sponsor
Guacamole pockets an its green just like a dumpter
Run up on the kidd , best believe i will dump ya
Young juice man and ma pockets green like dumpter
Run up on the kidd , best believe i will dump ya
Young juice man and ma pockets green like dumpter
