[Intro: OJ Da Juiceman]
Just another day on the Bouldercrest turf
Just around the corner, young nigga got murked
Talking all that shit, now his face is on a shirt
If you run up on me wrong, I'ma shoot you like I'm Dirk

[Hook: OJ Da Juiceman]
Just another day on the Bouldercrest turf
Just around the corner, young nigga got murked
Talking all that shit, now his face is on a shirt
If you run up on me wrong, I'ma shoot you like I'm Dirk
Bang (6x), I'ma shoot you like I'm Dirk
Bang (6x), I'ma shoot you like I'm Dirk, nigga

[Verse 1: OJ Da Juiceman]
Time to do a drill, I don't need no pill
All a nigga need stolen car and some shells
Dancing with the Devil, 'bout to send your ass to hell
Glock 27, long extendo for my clip
Bandana and a donkey, Cinnabon drum for my stick
When that skrrt hit the corner, boy I'm down with the shit
When that windows come down, left his pants full of shit
Now his momma wanna cry 'cause she raised a li'l bitch
Put that nigga on a shirt, may that pussy rest in piss
While I'm still getting money out here flipping these bricks
Blowing gas in the kitchen while I activate my wrist (Gas)
Drinking up the lean, pouring up the Actavis (Aye!)

[Hook: OJ Da Juiceman]
Just another day on the Bouldercrest turf
Just around the corner, young nigga got murked
Talking all that shit, now his face is on a shirt
If you run up on me wrong, I'ma shoot you like I'm Dirk
Bang (6x), I'ma shoot you like I'm Dirk
Bang (6x), I'ma shoot you like I'm Dirk, nigga

[Verse 2: Yung Tank]
[?] I ain't even gotta cock
Boy you better that I'm with the shits (Ask about it)
White girl say she love my Glock
'Cause that bitch got a big black dick
Nigga talking shit but it's down on the low
Talking amongst each other, yeah they thought we ain't know
But when we run into 'em, nigga there's no problems
Juiceman, Bouldercrest, fuck nigga, not one
Shoot up a whole apartment complex and you don't hit shit but a little girl
That's like me shooting up a whole park, bitch and don't hit shit but a motherfucking squirrel
Try to play Juice out the zip for 500
Talking 'bout you killed some, bitch you ain't killed nothing
All [?] set [?] book
Fuck nigga, you a dumb ass crook
.44 Bulldog in the bitch car, silencer on the strap but the 20 is a loss like
Boy, hit you long way like Dirk, hoe
Glock 18 go bang like Kirko
Just made 6100 off a bag of gas
Juice made 30 bands off a half a brick
Shit, we really up 30, bitch

[Hook: OJ Da Juiceman]
Just another day on the Bouldercrest turf
Just around the corner, young nigga got murked
Talking all that shit, now his face is on a shirt
If you run up on me wrong, I'ma shoot you like I'm Dirk
Bang (6x), I'ma shoot you like I'm Dirk
Bang (6x), I'ma shoot you like I'm Dirk, nigga
