[Hook: OJ Da Juiceman] (2x)
I sell bricks, I sell deuces, I sell fours, I sell nines
I got pills, I got lean, I got pounds all different kinds
I sell verses, sell out shows, 442 Forgiato
And she squatted on the flo'
Crest nigga, show yo gold

[Verse 1: OJ Da Juiceman]
Aye!
30 racks to say the "Aye"
I be boomin, bunking, trappin, hustlin just 'bout every day
Okay!
20 more to say "Okay"
Selling bricks and cooking fours, 442 Forgiato
Well damn!
Sipping lean and blowing kush
Skrrrt!
Just sold my young nigga a deuce
Skrrrt!
That's the rear end on the 442
I told you that young Juice the truth
I'm boomin', bunkin' what it do?

[Hook: OJ Da Juiceman] (2x)

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
My niggas will kill
[?] jumping back
Jumping jack, rubberband snapping on another stack
For real
All I got is work to twerk
Snake skinned seats, murked a serpent for the vert
They told me chill
I ain't even turn up yet, y'all ain't even seen nothing
I'll rob you if you if you lucky
So what the deal?
Riding 'round with this dummy
Tryna off that trick, bet I trick you out your money

[Hook: OJ Da Juiceman] (2x)

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
Bricks, I paid 30 but a nigga made like 42
Jackie Chan in the kitchen, right wrist just like Kung-Fu
Huaaahh!
Super clean dog food
Pounds of purp and pounds of kush
Even got the pills too
Say you want a feature, could've charged like 20 times 2
Mr. "Aye Okay Okay" still selling babies too
Well damn, well damn, well damn
442 on twenty-fours
Then I pull up to the club on Forgiatos
