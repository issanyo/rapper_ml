[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane, I go so hard sometimes
I be like, "Goddamn, where I get these rhymes?"
Flow so fucking crazym,, I done lost my mind
I’m icy as a polar bear, look, I am not lying
Gucci go so hard sometimes
I be like, "Goddamn, where I get all those rhymes?"
Flow so fucking crazy, I done lost my mind
I’m icy as a polar bear, look, I am not lying

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
California indo, kush bag in the rental
I was selling izzo’s, niggas was playing Nintendo
My girls all spoiled, crazy things they ask me
And when I tell them no, they have temper tantrums
If you don't see me shining, then you need some glasses
Sorry, girlfriend, but your man's a has-been
That's costume jewelry that your man is wearing
It's old, not shining 'cause them ain't diamonds
Money like Yao Ming, pulled up in that red thing
Killed the parking lot, leave it just like a crime scene
Just stop it, Gucci bags, shoes and the wallet
Lions, tigers, bears in my hood and in my closet

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane, I go so hard sometimes
I be like, "Goddamn, where I get these rhymes?"
Flow so fucking crazym,, I done lost my mind
I’m icy as a polar bear, look, I am not lying
Gucci go so hard sometimes
I be like, "Goddamn, where I get all those rhymes?"
Flow so fucking crazy, I done lost my mind
I’m icy as a polar bear, look, I am not lying

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Call the coroners 'cause the boy smelling bad
I'm a thug ass nigga, I let my pants sag
I bought swag, I don't trust shit, nigga
Say "Fuck Gucci", I'm dumping off the rip, nigga
I'll be damned if we let a nigga stop our check
They want beef? Load it up, shawty, that's a bet
No fucking flex, I'm so good
Just Google me, it'll tell you that I'm hood
Not Cali, nigga, but out in Cali, nigga
I know Cali niggas, su woo, rowdy niggas
They would geek a nigga up like suspenders
I see life clearer through these Cartier lenses

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane, I go so hard sometimes
I be like, "Goddamn, where I get these rhymes?"
Flow so fucking crazym,, I done lost my mind
I’m icy as a polar bear, look, I am not lying
Gucci go so hard sometimes
I be like, "Goddamn, where I get all those rhymes?"
Flow so fucking crazy, I done lost my mind
I’m icy as a polar bear, look, I am not lying

[Verse 3: OJ da Juiceman]
My ring, my chain, don't you like my chain, man?
If you reach for it, then I'll shoot you in your brain, man
I'm icy as a polar bear, chain locked down like chain gang
Young Juiceman and my diamonds don't gangbang
Disrespect this clique, then we'll put you in a wheelchair
Hydra-Shok tip have you rolling in a wheelchair
Think that I'm a rapper, but I will take it there
Then I'm cooler than a fan, but my attitude a grizzly bear

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane, I go so hard sometimes
I be like, "Goddamn, where I get these rhymes?"
Flow so fucking crazym,, I done lost my mind
I’m icy as a polar bear, look, I am not lying
Gucci go so hard sometimes
I be like, "Goddamn, where I get all those rhymes?"
Flow so fucking crazy, I done lost my mind
I’m icy as a polar bear, look, I am not lying
