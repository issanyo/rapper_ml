[Intro]
Aye! What it do, cuh?
Juiceman, unh, Juiceman, unh
Aye! 32 Entertainment
What it do, cuh?
Aye, I'm still boomin' babies and I'm still serving junkies
Aye! Getting to the money
Aye! Aye!

[Hook]
I'm boomin', I'm bunkin', I'm serving all the babies
Buy the brick, bust the brick and still serve the junkies
I'm boomin', I'm bunkin', I'm serving all the babies
Buy the brick, bust the brick and still serve the junkies
I'm boomin', I'm bunkin' (x7)
And still serve the junkies

[Verse 1]
I'm boomin', I'm bunkin', the dope game gravy
Busting down bricks and bales, scraping up the paper
Bouldercrest swag and my pockets getting greater
6 cellphones, still working in Decatur
7 different trap spots, shaking off the haters
Now Later swag by your girl, I'ma date her
Pappadeaux Diner, shark fin and the gator
Murry shoe walking and my feet is in some gators
Prada and the Gucci got me spending all my paper
Neiman Marcus shawty like I play for the Lakers
Cracker Barrel Charger, donk like the (?)
'72 Cutlass same color as a marble
Working bricks and bales got Juice like Wells Fargo
Stupid racked up and I'm rad like my father
Hummer H2 same color as a quarter
Young Juiceman put the deuces in the water

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Right hand cooking, egg beater turning
Thousand after thousand got me posted with your woman
VVS diamonds same color as some vomit
'69 Chevelle same color as the (comet?)
Left hand stupid dog and I'm doing numbers
Hundred karat chain got me flexing for the summer
Pyrex working got me like a jumper
Ain't playing ball but dog I got them numbers
Comma, comma, comma, and don't forget the comma
(?) donk got me faster than a runner
(?) bag gone, goddamn, I'm a stunner
Hundred racks thrown on the necklace and the Hummer
Pinky ring acre, you can ask my momma
Bricks and the bales got me bunkin', jumping, bunkin'
(?) Juice and we doing numbers
Bouldercest niggas and we on the come up

[Hook]
