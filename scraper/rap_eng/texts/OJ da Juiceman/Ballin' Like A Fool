[Intro: OJ Da Juiceman]
Let me hit it mike
Let me hit that motherfucker mike
Juiceman in this motherfucker
Cartel MGM, what up?

[Hook: OJ Da Juiceman]
I came in with them bricks, I left out with the money
I got pounds of the gas, got your bitch on the molly
I'm a walking vault baby, I can't do the wallet
Pull out these bands and these bands go to popping
Ballin' like a fool like I'm in the NBA
Ballin' like a fool like I play with MJ
Ballin' like a fool every day my birthday
Ballin' like a fool 'cause I'm stupid with the cake

[Verse 1: OJ Da Juiceman]
Bands, call me Rubberband Shawty
50 (?) plus I'm Neiman Marcus shopping
Gwap, man my pockets so gwapy
Murry shoe, Gucci shoe, Louie shoe walking
My belt cost a hundred, 450 for the Prada
Came from the hood so on my block, we got prada
4 pockets full, pockets on Wells Fargo
Pull up to your trap, burnt orange Murcielago
93 gas and (?) flaming pyro
Wrapping up the bricks like I'm fixing up a gyro
32 ENT, we plugged in with Pablo
Tractor trailer pulling up and it filled with cargo

[Hook: OJ Da Juiceman]

[Verse 2: Cartel MGM]
My plug ain't got no bricks so he gave me a pound of meth
Get money, fuck hoes, stay strapped to the death
I wanna go to the club but I got 50 pounds left
White folks don't wanna sign me, I got a dope boy check
I'm walking on bricks, but I ain't Jesus Christ
Unload a whole van full of work, don't it sound nice?
Ballin' like a fool, stay strapped up with that tool
Wrapped them bales up at 15, ain't had time for no school
In the NBA with OJ, shooting blocks of yay
Packs came in yesterday, turned the money in a day
My partner keep that 'K, if you ever wanna play
I just made history, the first Mexican in the NBA

[Hook: OJ Da Juiceman]

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
Ballin' with the money, I just sold a dummie
25 percentage, he thought he got 100
The AK hold a hundred, this mini hold a hundred
In my trap house posted up like we Tim Duncan
I had to cross him over, boss (?) Rondo
Ball, pills, numbers and we get it to you pronto
Call my old mail man, have him bring it to your front do'
Walking with the bricks but my hands all on commando
I got that fish scale like a nigga I found Nemo
Got so many birds like the Disney movie Rio
Caught your main girl and her buddy, had a trio
Taco Bell shawty, selling bricks like burritos

[Hook: OJ Da Juiceman]
