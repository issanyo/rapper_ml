[Intro: OJ da Juiceman]
Aye! What it do, cuz?
Juiceman in the building
Bolo, Eldorado Red, cuz
32 Enter-motherfucking-tainment... aye!
It's a Mike WiLL production
Young Juice in the building

[Hook: OJ da Juiceman]
Nine in the morning and I'm cooking chickens
Five in the morning and I'm water whipping
Nine in the morning and I'm cooking chickens
Five in the morning and I'm water whipping
Water whip the dope, water whip the dope
Straight drop the dope, straight drop the dope
Water whip the dope, water whip the dope
Straight drop the dope, straight drop the dope

[Verse 1: OJ da Juiceman]
Nine in the morning and I'm cooking chickens
Big Breitling ring got Juice water whipping
Customized Breitling watch got your bitch dipping
645, two-seater's where she sitting
Back to the spot is where I stupid, stupid get it
Bricks and the bales got Juice with the ticket
My favorite color green like the Celtics' big ticket
Hummer H2 sitting on them Scottie Pippens
Working six cell phones and it's big pimping
Seven different trap spots and it's crammed with chickens
Juice, Bolo, and Red stay water whipping
Catch in the kitchen, whipping, whipping, whipping

[Hook: OJ da Juiceman]
Nine in the morning and I'm cooking chickens
Five in the morning and I'm water whipping
Nine in the morning and I'm cooking chickens
Five in the morning and I'm water whipping
Water whip the dope, water whip the dope
Straight drop the dope, straight drop the dope
Water whip the dope, water whip the dope
Straight drop the dope, straight drop the dope

[Verse 2: Bolo]
Me no broka, yeah, me no broka
My trap is going loca, my trap is going loca
Yo, once I get the coca, yeah, once I get the coca
I bust it wide open, I bust it wide open
You know I ain't joking, yeah, you know I ain't joking
And I don't take it back once that bitch is open
Once that bitch is open, yeah, once that bitch is open
Straight drop the work and get the trap open
Yeah, get the trap open, I see you haters scoping
I see you haters scoping, hoping, you hoping
You catch me for some work, but I don't wear no skirt
I always pack a tool and my funk game a fool

[Hook: OJ da Juiceman]
Nine in the morning and I'm cooking chickens
Five in the morning and I'm water whipping
Nine in the morning and I'm cooking chickens
Five in the morning and I'm water whipping
Water whip the dope, water whip the dope
Straight drop the dope, straight drop the dope
Water whip the dope, water whip the dope
Straight drop the dope, straight drop the dope
