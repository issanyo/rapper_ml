[Intro: Eldorado Red]
Ay, my nigga
Niggas keep asking me, "Red, when you gonna sign this deal?"
Nigga, I got the three P's in my life, nigga:
Purp, pills, and popcorn

[Hook: OJ da Juiceman & Eldorado Red]
Purp on deck, pills on deck
Popcorn mid coming from the Midwest
Nigga, fuck a record deal, I'll sign myself
Nigga, fuck a record deal, I'll sign myself
Purp on deck, pills on deck
Popcorn mid coming from the Midwest
Nigga, fuck a record deal, I'll sign myself
Nigga, fuck a record deal, I'll sign myself

[Verse: OJ da Juiceman]
Young Juiceman and I'm posted with that Barney
Eldorado Red saying kush in Monday
Bouldercrest working, so you know I'm getting money
Hummer H2, set it on them chrome dummies
Six 15's got my Hummer truck jumping
Million rings stupid plus my trap bunking
Pills for $250, now tell me who's bunking
Popcorn mid and I serve it to the country
Midwest trapping, Juice so Southern
'68 Cutlass squatting on them Budniks
[?] doing numbers, chain VS flooding
Young Juiceman and you know i stay stunting

[Hook: OJ da Juiceman & Eldorado Red]
Purp on deck, pills on deck
Popcorn mid coming from the Midwest
Nigga, fuck a record deal, I'll sign myself
Nigga, fuck a record deal, I'll sign myself
Purp on deck, pills on deck
Popcorn mid coming from the Midwest
Nigga, fuck a record deal, I'll sign myself
Nigga, fuck a record deal, I'll sign myself
