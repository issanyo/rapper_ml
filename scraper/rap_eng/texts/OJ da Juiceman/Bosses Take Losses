[Intro]
Chyeah
Aye...
Juiceman in this motherfucker...
Bosses take losses

[Hook]
When you playing in this game, boy you gotta take some losses
Nigga ain't no bosses if he can't accept no losses
Playing in this game, boy you gotta take some losses
Nigga ain't no bosses if he can't accept no losses
I'm a boss (6x)
So I accept the loss
I'm a boss (6x) nigga
So I accept the loss

[Verse 1]
Took a loss with them bricks nigga, yeah it had me sick nigga
Couldn't eat, sleep, shit, couldn't even fuck my bitch, nigga
Had me stressing 'bout the plug, thinking he done set me up
But he keep it 1000, I know he didn't cross me up
Random picking on my shit, they must got some good luck
So I had to flip the script, went and switched my game room up
Yeah a boss gon' take a loss, been that way since I came up
All these niggas do is talk, my choppa spit like Daffy Duck
Smoking on this California, standing on this Georgia dirt
Nigga tried to pull a move, left his ass on a shirt
Now I'm back in the kitchen cooking yams, drinking purp
When you take a loss nigga, just go extra hard with work

[Hook]
When you playing in this game, boy you gotta take some losses
Nigga ain't no bosses if he can't accept no losses
Playing in this game, boy you gotta take some losses
Nigga ain't no bosses if he can't accept no losses
I'm a boss (6x)
So I accept the loss
I'm a boss (6x) nigga
So I accept the loss

[Verse 2]
I been crossed out by some friends, some niggas no longer friends
Should've seen the snakes when they hit me with that [?]
They killed Blockbeater, goddamn, they split his wig
I took a loss there, my nigga, can you dig?
Me, Duke and Dayon, boy you know we did it big
And when I took that loss, my nigga, I shed a couple tears
Reminiscing to this day, my nigga, we shared them couple beers
And still to this day, I pour out bottles for my peers
Stay strapped 'til the end of time come
Young nigga trapping with a big long gun
Posted in the Valley with a big crack bomb
See Dekalb County, better break and run
Wrestling with the pigs, boy you know it ain't fun
Just took a loss, can't pay no bond
[?] for a nigga to run
Facing these charges, toting this gun

[Hook]
When you playing in this game, boy you gotta take some losses
Nigga ain't no bosses if he can't accept no losses
Playing in this game, boy you gotta take some losses
Nigga ain't no bosses if he can't accept no losses
I'm a boss (6x)
So I accept the loss
I'm a boss (6x) nigga
So I accept the loss
