What's up, little shawty? What that thing do?
Bust that thing open, your booty's so in tune
What's up, little shawty? What that thing do?
Bust that thing open, your booty's so in tune
Now, can you work it out? Can you work me out?
Can you stretch it out? Baby, I'ma work you out
Can you work me out? Can you work it?
Can you stretch it out? Baby, I'ma work you out

[Verse 1]
What's up, little shawty? I'ma work you out
Interfere your ass and your tail running routes
Post up with them bricks, serve them straight out of your house
Don't worry 'bout them neighbors, baby, you the only spouse
With them bright green grass, words spitting out my mouth
I can buy a whole team once I stretch it out
You got too many pounds, baby, you need to work it out
I'm icy as a fool, baby, the 'Crest ice me out
In the strip club, Grants and Franklins jumps out
Blowing on that loud, it's the kushman cloud
Young Juiceman with more snow than the plow
If you wanna know my life, I've been gangsta for a while

[Hook]
What's up, little shawty? What that thing do?
Bust that thing open, your booty's so in tune
What's up, little shawty? What that thing do?
Bust that thing open, your booty's so in tune
Now, can you work it out? Can you work me out?
Can you stretch it out? Baby, I'ma work you out
Can you work me out? Can you work it?
Can you stretch it out? Baby, I'ma work you out

[Verse 2]
Now, can you work it out, or can you work me out?
Take you to the house, show you what I'm 'bout
Twerk your back and mouth, girl, it's that dirty south
They call me Young Juiceman and I got them grams
Bouldercrest working with them stupid bands
If you's a hot girl, them racks will make a fan
If you's a freaky girl, then do a handstand
You got on Juice shirts with the headbands
Right wrist icy, girl, get his Caravan
Purp buying, kush blowing from my Cali man
If your boyfriend trip, a hundred shots like the Taliban
Young Juiceman with the bricks in the trash cans

[Hook]
What's up, little shawty? What that thing do?
Bust that thing open, your booty's so in tune
What's up, little shawty? What that thing do?
Bust that thing open, your booty's so in tune
Now, can you work it out? Can you work me out?
Can you stretch it out? Baby, I'ma work you out
Can you work me out? Can you work it?
Can you stretch it out? Baby, I'ma work you out

[Verse 3]
Look at little shawty with that fat ass
Sitting in them jeans remind me of them pound bags
Busting down blocks, put them wraps in the bag
You got a pretty face with that donkey in them pants
Gucci stiletto heels, baby, you a made fan
When I get you to the spot, I'ma [?] like some grams
Headed to the 'Crest 'cause Juice a made man
Bouldercrest working and I'm cooking right hand

[Hook]
What's up, little shawty? What that thing do?
Bust that thing open, your booty's so in tune
What's up, little shawty? What that thing do?
Bust that thing open, your booty's so in tune
Now, can you work it out? Can you work me out?
Can you stretch it out? Baby, I'ma work you out
Can you work me out? Can you work it?
Can you stretch it out? Baby, I'ma work you out
