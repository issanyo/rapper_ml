[Intro]
Yessir

[Hook]
4 o'clock in the morning, nigga we still working
5 o'clock in the morning, nigga we still working
6 o'clock in the morning, nigga we still working
Middle of the day, nigga we still working
Work (12x)
Middle of the day, nigga we still working

[Verse 1]
Never close the shop 'cause it's always bunkin'
Rain, sleet or snow, we gon' get this trap money
Stay under the radar, low chance of catching fumbles
Gotta count your blessings, every dollar bless momma
Bricks and the nicks got my pockets cucumber
Jolly Green Giant 'cause I had to climb this lumber
Got a big trap and the bitch do numbers
Sarah Lee with the bread, throw the steak and crumbs
Whole time, convicted felons, stayed around guns
Bouldercrest nigga working off a big bomb
Eagle came in and it dropped megatons
Posted in the trap with them military guns
Heavy kush smoke, nigga, all in my lungs
93 Octane taste like bubblegum
32 ENT, you can get you some
Bouldercrest nigga with a Bouldercrest bomb (Aye!)

[Hook]

5 o'clock in the morning, nigga we still working
6 o'clock in the morning, nigga we still working
Middle of the day, nigga we still working
Work (12x)
Middle of the day, nigga we still working

[Verse 2]
Middle of the day, nigga we still working
Late night, 4 or 5 and we out lurking
Stay in the water, might as well be a surfer
Smoking on the gas, car color Steve Urkel
Playing with the right one, them young boys will murk ya
Paradise soldier, eagle (?) killers
Posted at the store with 5 dollar bag (?)
Nigga try to rob, burn him with this dirty pistol
TTG, we trained to go
Kick the door for pounds and blow
(?) with the dough
Never crossing me and go
I be on that money train, bullshit is out the door
Everybody hustling, everybody got some bricks and blow
Only thing about it, Juiceman got them bricks for the low
If I'm doing super bad then the junkies so-so
Juggin' like a fool, McDonald's and (?) Texaco
32 ENT, bricks sent from Mexico
