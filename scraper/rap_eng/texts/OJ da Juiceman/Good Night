Verse 1: OJ da Juiceman
Hold up, Hold up, Big rang, Big watch, crushed ice
Young Juiceman and I'm shining like the street light
Step off in the club and my chain say goodnight
Baby girl you foolish if you think the kid ain't wrapped tight
Maserati cope in the blue in over night
Sprite mixed pink you can call that a pink sprite
And the way I live, You can call that street life
VVS diamonds everybody say goodnight

Hook: Gucci Mane & OJ da Juiceman
Gucci: 20 bricks a night make your girl say goodnight
OJ: 20 bricks a night make your girl say goodnight
Gucci: I walk off in the club and my chain say goodnight
OJ: I step off in the club and my chain say goodnight
Gucci: My watch and my rang looking just like crushed ice
OJ: My watch and my ring lookin' just like crushed ice
Gucci: I got the lean and the sprite so I need to get some crushed ice
OJ: Lean and the sprite so I need to get some crushed ice

Verse 2: Gucci Mane
Godly, Who's he? Who me? Its So
Icey E.N.T and do you understand me?
I'm a walkin' bank roll and you can rubber band me
Goodnight, its a 30 thousand dollar show spree
See a chain with better clarity than bleach on me
Yeah I'm white, I'm catching light like a dog catch fleas
Its a Kodak moment, Everybody say cheese
The car so cloudy that your girl can't breathe (GUCCI!)

[Hook]

Verse 3: OJ da Juiceman
20 bricks a week make the girl say goodnight
Pull up to the club, 72 with the loud pike
Ring, watch, chain and bracelet purchased by the street light
Buy the whole bar make the club say goodnight
Swag so stupid and my diamonds cut just right
Compliments the flow, powder stones just ain't right
Colored stones separated by blue and white
OJ da Juiceman came up off the corner right

[Hook]

Verse 4: Gucci Mane
I'm smokin' with my left to show my watch off when I'm blowing
This kush is Superfragilisticexpialidocious
50 bags I'm bringin' they would think I'm toting groceries
But they can call that I purchased just to feed the family
Baby call me back, God-damn a nigga gamblin'
Trap still jumpin' like a baby on the trampoline
Goodnight, crushed ice, sprite, and promethezine
Goodnight, crushed ice, watch, chain, pinkie rang

[Hook]
