[Intro: Young Scooter]
Yeah nigga, we real mothafuckin' workin' in my hood, nigga
We don't get no sleep

[Hook: Young Scooter]
We stay down through them street lights (work!)
Spot's opened day and night (juug!)
We work out trap houses
Got a lot of bales piled up
All I want is commas (Freebandz!)
I got a lot of money (count up!)
Everybody know the streets
I'm the voice of the streets

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I still sleep in the projects (the prince)
I'm talkin' two hundred dollar rent
Plus I ain't got no water bill
And I got illegal cable still
All I want is commas (Freebandz!)
I got dope boy money
Black Migo known for stuntin'
Now I'm million dollar hustlin' (work!)
For rappin' 'bout my days of hustlin'
When I was broke and had nothin' (on E!)
By any means necessary
I juug from January to January (count up!)

[Hook: Young Scooter]
We stay down through them street lights (work!)
Spot's opened day and night (juug!)
We work out trap houses
Got a lot of bales piled up
All I want is commas (Freebandz!)
I got a lot of money (count up!)
Everybody know the streets
I'm the voice of the streets

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got places to go and I got people to see
It cost you 20 thousand dollars to hear my voice on a beat
I cut my girl off, it's too many fish in the sea
Fishscale in the house, it's like we at Captain D's
It don't bother me that he go more than me
You know it's loyalty over royalties
Got the bail money for you and the lawyer fees
Im sellin' Florida kis, I'm sellin' Cali trees
My Chinese plug sendin' pills, it's linsanity
She only 2, already usin' profanity
My Migo friend said I made a bil' annually
You call them niggas who rob your crew, I call them family

[Hook: Young Scooter]
We stay down through them street lights (work!)
Spot's opened day and night (juug!)
We work out trap houses
Got a lot of bales piled up
All I want is commas (Freebandz!)
I got a lot of money (count up!)
Everybody know the streets
I'm the voice of the streets

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
Pounds and bales, yeah I know them well
Gotta weigh my coke with this scale, they weighed a whale
In my trap house, I got that fish scale
It's like a nail shop the way I work my clientele
Six cell phones, Karl Malone, I make the mail
Keys to the city, yeah Young Juiceman he's the mayor
Stupid with the plug, and I'ma juug it out
200 thousand dollars in South Dekalb Mall
All I know is ball, in the streets crawl
32 free bands and we want it all
Drop a 36, dunk it like I'm John Wall
In the pot, now my money in the wall

[Hook: Young Scooter]
We stay down through them street lights (work!)
Spot's opened day and night (juug!)
We work out trap houses
Got a lot of bales piled up
All I want is commas (Freebandz!)
I got a lot of money (count up!)
Everybody know the streets
I'm the voice of the streets
