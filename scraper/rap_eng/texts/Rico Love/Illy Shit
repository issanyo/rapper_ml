[Intro]
M-I-D Dub E-S-T
This is Batters, Don't forget the S-E plus Z
This ain't part of the sixteen, I'm just warming up the vocals
All about my male, on this track I'm going postal

[Verse 1]
I'ma show these niggas how to spit up on some illy shit
Enough to fill a tank on that, on that Free Willy Shit
I'm bringing out that Lupe, S-L-R with new paint
Flow is frozen water boy! Call me Bobby Coolcher
Damn I'm going silly, y'all actin' Milli Vanilli
This is off of the dome, no pad, no lily
Really on point, heatin' mics on that, on that Bibby shit
Cause the game is in the genes kid, on that Billie Shit
I shook hands, game time, throw the ball up
The game name me the chosen one I'm bout to hit a Paul up
Shooting for the green, dog better put your paws up
Ballin' on the wall, I guess I'm going walnuts
I'm tied up, getting money, those is cash knots
Heavy ham, more fire than hell boy, I'm past hot
Puttin' all that fake shit behind me, ass shots
I be, I be turning heads, Temple U mascot

[Outro](2x)
I be spittin' illy shit, I-I be spittin' illy shit (3x)
The S izzy, that midwest illy shit
