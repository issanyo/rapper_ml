Took another flight outta town last night

And I wonder, wonder who you’re gonna see

I bet she’s lying there in your hotel bedroom

No wonder, wonder you ain’t callin me

Maybe I should break up with you over voicemail

No wonder, wonder you ain’t calling me

Maybe I should pop up on you at your hotel

Cause I wonder, wonder who you’re gonna see

Oh here I go, thinking of things again

Ohhh here I go, asking you where you been

Ohhh the nerve of me

In the night stand there’s a bible

I’m sure that’s where you put those three golden wrappers

Then you make love to my rival

And send me I love you texas, the morning after

Took another flight outta town last night

And I wonder, wonder who you’re gonna see

I bet she’s laying there in your hotel bedroom

No wonder, wonder you ain’t callin me

Maybe I should break up with you over voicemail

(Yeaaa) No wonder, wonder you ain’t calling me

Maybe I should pop up on you at your hotel

Cause I wonder, wonder who you’re gonna see (oooooooo)

Ohhh here I go calling your mom again

You know she ain’t gonna lie for you

You know that I would die for you

But I’m sure that I’ll wipe tears from my eyes again, again

In the night stand there’s a bible

I’m sure that’s where you put those three golden wrappers

Then you make love to my rival

And send me I love you texas, the morning after

Took another flight outta town last night

And I wonder, wonder who you’re gonna see

I bet she’s laying there in your hotel bedroom

No wonder, wonder you ain’t callin me

Maybe I should break up with you over voicemail

No wonder, wonder you ain’t calling me

Maybe I should pop up on you at your hotel

Cause I wonder, wonder who you’re gonna see
