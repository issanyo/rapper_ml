[Dustin]
It`s the way that you touch me
You let me know that you love me
And the way that you kiss me
You let me know that you miss me
And nobody's gonna take me from you

[Hook]

You got, you got,you got me
Going crazy I`m caught up
I don`t know what to do
You got,you got, you got me
(And all you gotta do is) call me
I`ll be there in a hurry

[Patrick]
You make me feel special
I`m on top of the world when I`m next to you (you)
I just wanna caress you
I love all the things that you do
I`m right here I isn't going no where cause

[Hook]

You got, you got,you got me
Going crazy I`m caught up
I don`t know what to do
You got,you got, you got me
(And all you gotta do is) call me
I`ll be there in a hurry

[Bridge]

I know it's hard for you to see
That girl your the only one for me

[Kelly's Rap]
I`m clean from my feet up
Check my jeans and my sneakers
Flea from the scene like cheetah
Then I come right back with love
Matter fact Im going to back you up
That`s how to act
So don`t try to act like
You don't wanna act right
Looking for me in the day time with a flashlight
I`m not a half pint
More like a liter
I`ll leave you my phone number and I`ll see ya when I see ya
More charm than Mike Seaver
I'm either that hottest dude spitting
Or your dudes is tripping
And a lot ducks chase the bus
But I isn`t press on a bird
Can`t nobody break us up
Cause now you got me
You can spend 100,000 with papi
Automobile or that Kawasaki sent
We a team till the death
And I wanna be your homeboy, your boyfriend, your boo, and your best friend
You got me

[Hook]

You got, you got,you got me
Going crazy I`m caught up
I don`t know what to do
You got,you got, you got me
(And all you gotta do is) call me
I`ll be there in a hurry
