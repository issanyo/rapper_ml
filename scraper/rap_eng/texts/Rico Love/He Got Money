[Bridge]
Maybe it seems like we take it too far but we ain't never had shit
All we know is hustlin', we be on that cash shit
And when we see a bad bitch...

[Verse 1]
Hold up, you know he got money
But don't ask that nigga for nothin', you know he act funny
You know he got cars, look at his gloss
And all of his niggas is winnin', look at 'em lookin' like bosses
You know he got money
He go in the club, he leave with a chick and he go in her tummy
If that nigga said it, you know he ain't lyin'
And, if he invite you, you know that he buyin'
You know he got paper
How dare you show him apartments that ain't got no elevator?
You know that be boojie, he need a jacuzzi
He need a massage, he need him a bitch in Emilio Pucci

[Bridge]

[Hook]
She be like
"You know he got money?" (x4)

[Verse 2]
You know he got mula
And he ain't takin' no breaks, nigga, no Ferris Bueller
He tryna build him a house on the ocean
That sits right across from his house on the ocean
You know he got money
You know he got Asians, know he got Haitians, know he got bunnies
Lon Bon and she rock Chanel
Photoshoots with Dave LaChapelle
You know he be stuntin'
Yeah, he hit her but how the fuck he 'posed to know that's your woman?
All he know is she thinkin' she chose
You gotta do better when pickin' these hoes

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3]
Maybe I'm to blame for the opulence I glorify
All the girls I cheated with, all the nights my shorty cried
Lifestyles of the rich and young, crackers hate a nigga
Jackas make it so you gotta go and get your gun
Where they get them pictures from? Who taking them photographs?
Paps is peekin' at you, last year, they ain't even know yo' ass
Niggas run, yo' block is mad, niggas run, yo' city hurt
"Why you ain't put yo' city first?" I had to go and get it first!
Wishin' I could hit reverse
I'd a scooped up Cali Chrissy, he wouldn't be in no hearse
Killed my nephew Rocket over what was in his pocket
So, yeah, he got money but, tell me, what does it profit?

[Bridge + Hook]
