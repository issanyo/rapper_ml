[Skit]
Verily verily, I say unto you
Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die
It abideth alone
But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit
But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit
Like a grain of corn that's planted into the ground
It has to die first before it can produce
But if it dies, then it will bring forth a harvest
Verily verily, I say unto you
Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die
It abideth alone
But if it die, it bring forth much fruit
Even kings die
