[Intro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Never find a love like this
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Never find a love like this

[Verse 1]
Well, we go back so far
Swinging in your backyard
All the things that we used to do
We were cool back in high school
Ooh, I really liked you
Must've been your attitude

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why you keep on running
In and out of my mind
As the years they all roll by
Baby, now I know why
I keep coming back to you

[Chorus]
You're the only one that knows me
Love it when you hold me
Never find a love like this
(Let me hear you say)
Now I'll never be lonely
Look at what you've shown me
Never find a love like this
Well, this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
(Let me hear you say)
I'm so glad you found me
Wrap your world around me
Never find a love like this
(Love like this)

[Verse 2]
All the guys tried to take me
You're the one who saved me
I feel like I owe you my life
And as strange as it may seem
I'll go if you take me
I'm willing to sacrifice

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why you keep on running
In and out of my mind
As the years they all roll by
It's not hard to know why
I keep coming back to you

[Chorus]
You're the only one that knows me
Love it when you hold me
Never find a love like this
(Let me hear you say)
Now I'll never be lonely
Look at what you've shown me
Never find a love like this
Well, this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
(Let me hear you say)
I'm so glad you found me
Wrap your world around me
Never find a love like this

[Verse 3]
All my memories, they've got you in it
No use climbing trees, without leaves in it
All my broken dreams, you fix, you fix
Since you reminded me, like this, like this
I don't wanna miss you anymore
Don't wanna miss you anymore
(Let me hear you say)

[Chorus]
You're the only one that knows me
Love it when you hold me
Never find a love like this
(Let me hear you say)
Now I'll never be lonely
Look at what you've shown me
Never find a love like this
Well, this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
(Let me hear you say)
I'm so glad you found me
Wrap your world around me
Never find a love like this

[Outro until Fade]
Woah, oh
Never find a love like this
Woah, oh, woah oh
Never find a love like this
Love like this
Woah, oh, never find a love like this
Now, I'll never be lonely, look at what you show me
Woah, oh, I'll never find a love like this
Let me hear you say, oh, oh, oh
Never find a love like this
Well, this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart (never find a love like this)
Let me hear you say (woah, oh, oh)
Never find a love like this
Love like this
Woah, oh, never find a love like this
