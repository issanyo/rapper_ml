[Intro]
My sons, keep them
Please forgive me

[Verse 1]
Whoa, now, I think this woman went and put a hex on me
Whoa, now, why'd I let her go and put that sex on me?
Whoa, now, I probably shouldn't have watched that girl undress for me
The scent of her perfume in the air
Got it feeling different in here, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She took my breath away
On to some fancy ship
Into another place
Such an expensive trip
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money

[Chorus]
It’s the sins of my father
He left the debt to his son
To pay the girl who’s a mother
Collector won't let me run
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father

[Verse 2]
Whoa, now, she’s speaking in a tongue that sounds new to me
Whoa, now, mama told me what this could do to me
Whoa, now, I wouldn’t fall for something like this, usually
Tell me how could I ever prepare
If my papa never was there?

[Pre-Chorus]
She took my breath away
On to some fancy ship
Into another place
Such an expensive trip
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money

[Chorus]
It’s the sins of my father
He left the debt to his son
To pay the girl who’s a mother
Collector won't let me run
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father

[Bridge]
(Father)
Hurt me, please me, yeah (father)
No, I don’t deserve the debt that came with my birth (father) No, why have I been pretending this is something that that man come up with?
I’m praying I reverse this curse

[Chorus]
It’s the sins of my father
He left the debt to his son
To pay the girl who’s a mother
Collector won't let me run
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father
