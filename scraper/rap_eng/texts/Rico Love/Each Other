[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Right
Yeah
Turn the lights on

[Verse 1]
Just because you walked out that door
That don't mean I don't want you no more
The love you gave me made me insane
But a girl like me is so hard to take
Now I'm screaming "how you'd get here?"
Running around all through my mind
I wish your body would reappear
I won't let you run out this time

[Chorus]
Because the two of us
We're meant to love
Love each other
And I know the two of us
We're meant to touch
Touch each other
Turn the lights on

[Verse 2]
He didn't even tell me his name
But I swear I still feel him here
His kisses took away all my pain
His touches took away all my fears
Can you still smell my perfume?
Your pictures tattooed in my brain
I wish that he was up in my room
So I'm off to Paris, can't miss my train

[Chorus]
Because the two of us
We're meant to love
Love each other
And I know the two of us
We're meant to touch
Touch each other
Turn the lights on

[Bridge]
And someday, love is gonna bring us closer, baby
That's why I'm never giving it up
And I give you all of me, down to the heart of me
There's no escaping our love

[Chorus]
Because the two of us
We're meant to love
Love each other
And I know the two of us
We're meant to touch
Touch each other
Turn the lights on
