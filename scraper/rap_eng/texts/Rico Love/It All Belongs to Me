[Verse 1]
Loving you is hard
I feel like I'm about to hurt myself
And I don't want to do it, baby
I'm loving you so hard
And the way you act ain't been no help
So no no no sugar
(Yeah, you got it sweet, don't you?)

[Pre-Hook]
You must be blind
You must be dumb
You must be trippin'
You must be crazy
(You must be out yo damn mind)
To think that I'ma let you off that easy

[Hook]
I know you're mad, can't take no more
But put that back, that ain't yours
Have a fit, slam the door
But leave them bags on the floor
That shit belongs to me
Those clothes, those cars, those rings
Yeah, that MacBook
That shit belongs to me
So log off your Facebook
It all belongs to me

[Verse 2]
All you do is talk
Never knew you do too nothing else
You ain't good for nothing baby

It's like you got no heart
Cold as ice, and nothing can make you melt
No no no baby
Hold on one minute baby

[Pre-Hook & Hook]

[Bridge]
Ain't nothing leaving this house
Unless it's over my dead body, baby
So pack up all the things you came with
Cause loving you is just too dangerous

I know you're mad
Can't take no more
But put that back, that ain't yours
Have a fit, slam the door
But leave them bags on the floor
That shit belongs to me

Those clothes, those cars, those rings
And that macbook, that shit belongs to me
So log off your facebook
It all belongs to me, to me
It all belongs to me, to me
It all belongs to me, to me
It all belongs to me
