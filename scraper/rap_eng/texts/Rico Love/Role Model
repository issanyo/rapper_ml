[Intro - Justin Timberlake]
You gotta bare with me
Cause I’m, I don’t do this but fuck it
See what happens, no rules right?

[Justin Timberlake]
Come here baby, tell me what you doing with him?
I bet you’ll want me once you catch up to my rhythm
You gotta pay attention to me like a symptom
This shit got me amped up, Ritalin
Now don’t be fool, I ball like a Laker
I wipe that smelly shit away like erasers
And I never missed the mark like a maker
But you know I’m from the south, yeah-yer
Maybe me standing here pisses you off
Maybe you should be more like me, involved
I’m going hard like the opposite of soft
Now clap on clap on applause
Maybe you just mad cause I am who you wanna be
Maybe I’m a canvas you paint what you wanna see
Maybe you’re right, maybe I’m an asshole
Oops, did I take it too far? Super Bowl
I’ma still grab my balls, I’m on a roll
Yeah I’m that white boy shooting free throws
Automatic, Kobe but 2 to go
You need a role model, fuck it, you can play the role

[Free]
Freeze (now put your fingers up)
I got a rocket in my pocket
Everybody on their knees
That means I make the rules so pay attention to me
You don’t want to piss me off
Cause I might fuck around and squeeze
You can get you some of these nuts

[Hook - Elliott Ives/Justin Timberlake]
Cause I’m going in my own direction
If you don’t like it you can cut your TV off
Do it at your own discretion
And no apologies I’m on one soaking love
Role model, a role model, a role model
I’m not a role model, I’m not a role model
Role model, a role model, a role model
I’m not a role model, I’m not a role model
You need a role model, fuck it, you can play the role
You need a role model, fuck it, you can play the role

[Verse 2 - Free]
Freeze, you think I give a damn or worry about what these suckers think of me?
Baby my name is Free and I do whatever I please
So keep it pretty, these bitches 7 inches away from me
Or they might end up on these, nuts

[Hook - Elliott Ives/Justin Timberlake]
Cause I’m going in my own direction
If you don’t like it you can cut your TV off
You can view it at your own discretion
And no apologies I’m on one soaking love
Role model, a role model, a role model
I’m not a role model, I’m not a role model
Role model, a role model, a role model
I’m not a role model, I’m not a role model

[Verse 3 - Free]
I ain’t your mama, your daddy, your granny, cousin or uncle
In fact, I don’t even know you, you follow me on my Twitter
But that don’t mean that you know me
So tell me how did you figured that I’m supposed to be bigger
And try to handle my temper
But if you knew me remember, the 25 of December
When I just happened to reason because I’m the preacher
And yes I’m breaking some habits, no matter how hard you push
You can judge me or love me
Or you can grow you some nuts

[Hook - Elliott Ives/Justin Timberlake]
Cause I’m going in my own direction
If you don’t like it you can cut your TV off
You can view it at your own discretion
And no apologies I’m on one soaking love
Role model, a role model, a role model
I’m not a role model, I’m not a role model
Role model, a role model, a role model
Role model, a role model, a role model
You need a role model, fuck it, you can play the role
You need a role model, fuck it, you can play the role
