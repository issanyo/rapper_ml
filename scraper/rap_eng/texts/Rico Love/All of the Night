[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland]
Turn the lights on
In the middle of the bedroom
The kitchen or the hall way
Just give me a lot of leg room
And a little bit of foreplay
It ain't gotta be the night time
Just tell me when you feel it
Cause it’s always the right time
For love
Sometimes you gotta do it, do it, do it
Don’t talk too much, just kiss and touch me boy
Do it, do it
All day like the radio

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
So turn me up
Keep me pumping
Like I'm your favorite song
Boy, it ain’t nothing wrong
Makin' love, sweet love
With only nothing
Baby, just turn the music on
And I’ll be your favorite song

[Bridge: Kelly Rowland]
One and one, we’re having some fun
In the bedroom
All day and all of the night
Turn the lights on

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
It’s going down like a basement
I love it when the beat drop
I’m sick of being patient
I’m screaming when the beat stops
Did you wanna do it all alone?
Just catch it when I throw it
I’m giving you my all love
You sexy and you know it
You gotta do it, do it, do it
Don’t talk too much just kiss and touch me boy
Do it, do it
All day like the radio

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
So turn me up
Keep me pumping
Like I'm your favorite song
Boy, it ain’t nothing wrong
Makin' love, sweet love
With only nothing
Baby, just turn the music on
And I’ll be your favorite song

[Bridge: Kelly Rowland]
One and one, we’re having some fun
In the bedroom
All day and all of the night

[Verse 3: Rico Love]
Turn the lights on
I don’t mean to impose, but what the clothes for?
This is the bedroom, and that’s the closed door
I ain’t tryin' to flex, but I’ll be so yours
You’ll be my lioness, and we can go roar
Naw, I’m just playing ma’
First class D, you interested to stayin' by?
You interested to stay by?
After only one go 'round
You need one more round
Left hand full of hair
Cheek in my right palm
The type of shit you can put your life on
Love at the door with the lights on
Even if they off, you can still feel the python

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
So turn me up
Keep me pumping
Like I'm your favorite song
Boy, it ain’t nothing wrong
Makin' love, sweet love
With only nothing
Baby, just turn the music on
And I’ll be your favorite song
So turn me up
Keep me pumping
Like I'm your favorite song
Boy, it ain’t nothing wrong
Makin' love, sweet love
With only nothing
Baby, just turn the music on
And I’ll be your favorite song

[Bridge: Kelly Rowland]
One and one, we’re having some fun
In the bedroom
All day and all of the night
One and one, we’re having some fun
In the bedroom
All day and all of the night
Turn the lights on
