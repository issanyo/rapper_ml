[Intro]
D'Town Tha Great

[Chorus]
Pick yourself up, ain’t nobody helpin' no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga
(Pick yourself up, pick yourself up)
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga, no broke ass bitch, no
(Pick yourself up, pick yourself up)
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass nigga, pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass bitch, pick yourself up, pick yourself up

[Verse 1]
Uh, income tax check, you blow that shit
Buy that foreign, they repo that shit
She leave your dick dry, that ain't your bitch
Your partners made it rain, but you ain’t tip
Lame nigga, fame get ya nothin' but cameras and lights
Money on the table, you want friends and likes
Swipe up, wipe down, all the fresh for sale
Ain't no handouts here, nigga you can't tell
I'm I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T, nigga, you can't spell
What you know 'bout me? I don't know ’bout free
Money fall like leaves, better climb that tree
Pick yourself up

[Chorus]
Pick yourself up, ain’t nobody helpin' no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga
(Pick yourself up, pick yourself up)
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga, no broke ass bitch, no
(Pick yourself up, pick yourself up)
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass nigga, pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass bitch, pick yourself up, pick yourself up

[Verse 2]
I was sitting on the curb by my grandma yard
Dopeboys drive by, I’m like "that's my car"
Fast forward, stack for it, nigga that's my car
Push button, automatic, bitch I own that start
Dime bag, I don't bend, I don’t starve for mine
Will rap for a mil', coulda had that sign
Ride dirty, late night, coulda had that time
Way up high, drop top, you can't have this shine
Aw mane, cold game, if these walls could talk
They'd say, "Stack that shit, nigga get that vault"
Youngin' say he fucked up, that shit ain't my fault
Nigga pay them dues, nigga pay that cost
Pick yourself up

[Chorus]
Pick yourself up, ain't nobody helpin' no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga
(Pick yourself up, pick yourself up)
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga, no broke ass bitch, no
(Pick yourself up, pick yourself up)
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass nigga, pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass bitch, pick yourself up, pick yourself up

[Verse 3]
Weave right, edges right, but your bills ain't paid
Sugar daddy fly you out, but you still can't stay
Overnight, Gucci bag, you back on that plane
He married, you mad that you got played
Think you run one game, he ain't called you since
Homegirls got change, but you called them lame
'Cause they got that foreign, they buy all they clothes
They don't need no man, but you still that ho
Every man you fuck with tryna sow his oats
Every man you fuck with fuck then catch ghosts
'Cause the cars they drive like a moth to flame
You ain't pimpin' the game, tryna fuck for change
Pick yourself up

[Chorus]
Pick yourself up, ain't nobody helpin' no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga
(Pick yourself up, pick yourself up)
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga, no broke ass bitch, no
(Pick yourself up, pick yourself up)
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass nigga, pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass bitch, pick yourself up, pick yourself up
