(Hook)
She don't wanna be a freak no more
She don't wanna be a freak no more
She don't wanna be a freak no more
She says, she don't wanna be a freak no more
Oh, I think she lying
Oh, oh, I think she lying

(Verse 1)
Here they go acting all crazy, yo
Here they go talking but they don't know
I keep to myself cause they be shady, yo
Industry niggas, they'll hate on you, bitches, too
It's like their occupation
That's why she got her a reputation
But girl, you ain't done nothing to feel guilty about
I love when you be talking with that filthy mouth
Because grown people, ain't got time to be worrying bout you
All your bills are paid and your baby straight
You can do what you wanna do
But she says


(Hook)
She don't wanna be a freak no more
She don't wanna be a freak no more
She don't wanna be a freak no more
She says she don't wanna be a freak no more
Oh, I think she lying
Oh, oh, I think she lying


(Verse 2)
She don't wanna be a freak no more
She don't wanna be a freak no more
She don't wanna stay out all night
She don't wanna run the streets no more
And when she see me in the club she don't even wanna speak no more
Your knees don't get weak no more, you don't wanna skeet no more?
What's the occupation you chose? Dancer
So why you giving these hoes answers?
Cause you don't owe no explanations
You blow smoke for recreation
I drink brown and you want white
It's like jungle fever on the best vacation
It might go over they head
While I hold up both of yo legs
Ain't tryna give you no stress
But I be missing your sex and she says


(Hook)
