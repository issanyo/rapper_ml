(Intro)
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
We’d be in the same room
We don’t ever say shit
Let’s keep it between me and you
And we cool (Cause they don’t know)

[Verse 1: Rico Love]
I’m the one you be texting
When you be up at your job (They don’t know)
I’m the one that brought that Benz that’s in your garage (They don’t know)
I’m the reason you don’t stress when shit gets hard
And anything you want, it’s all yours
They don’t know
On your birthday I’m the one who saw your birthday suit (They don’t know)
Got that Birkin bag and bought that birthday coupe (They don’t know)
I keep it all real
I ain’t gotta tell lies to you
You’re the only one who knows the truth

[Hook]
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
We’d be in the same room
We don’t ever say shit
Let’s keep it between me and you
And we cool (Cause they don’t know)
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
They don’t even know I know you
You don’t be talking like a lame bitch
You follow the rules but keep it cool
Cause they don’t

[Verse 2: Quavo]
They don’t even know that I know you’re feeling me and you walk around like you don’t know
They don’t even know that you been down since a nigga trappin' in the bandos
They don’t even know that we made it
She helped me run up the big cases
I get on my knees and I’m prayin, ask God for this lady
They don’t know nothing about me, know nothing about you
Keep it that way, cool, they don’t know
If I go way back we’ve been fuckin with each other since high school
They don’t even know that she keep a 44
In the Birkin bag might go boom
Just telling you something about her
Cause you may know nothing about her

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Offset]
They don’t know Offset
They don’t even have a clue
They don’t know
When a nigga was stuck fucked up
In the county couldn't move
Every move
Every bitch left me but you
She was there
Young Offset is feelin’ you
Your head game is critical
I’m touching your body, I’m giving a physical
These bitches they hatin’, they envy you
If a nigga get pulled over she gon hold the work
It should be a crime how she hold a nigga down
Cut the other hoes off cause she said her feelings hurt
Up and down’s in relationship but we gon make it work

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
If I ain’t tell her you ain’t tell her, who they talkin bout then? (They don’t know)
I swear they don’t know how much time we’ve spent (They don’t know)
We started off talkin in French (They don’t know)
Blowin OG in the wind
The first one to show her a chicken
So much loyalty, so much loyalty
They don't know I bought the Benz
Chanel bag, put red on the bottom your shoes
They don’t know
And you say you want a hair salon
So I paid for her tuition, I had her schooled

[Hook]

[Outro]
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
Cause they don’t know
