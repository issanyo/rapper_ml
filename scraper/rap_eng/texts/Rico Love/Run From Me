[Verse 1]
Maybe I’m not ready for
Maybe I’m not ready to honest with you
Yeah, maybe I just wanna fuck
Relationships can only lead to problems with you

[Pre-Hook]
And I know you wondering, who hurt you in the past? Who made you feel so bad?
Who told you all those lies? Who hurt you we goodbye?
But I promised that I’d only blame it on me, no sense in pointing the finger
Cause obviously, nothing’s gon' change, the fact still remains, I'm still left here with this pain

[Hook]
So I'll advise you to, run from me
That's the best thing for you to do, go on, run from me
I’m no good for you, run from me
That’s the best advice I could give you, run from me, go on girl
