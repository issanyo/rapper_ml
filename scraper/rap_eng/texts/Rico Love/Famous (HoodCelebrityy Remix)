[Verse 1: Hoodcelebrityy]
Lemme get a glass of water
I just climbed a mountain, falling
You nuh need the world fi love you
'Cause I'm your number one supporter (yeah yeah)
You said "I hope you don't get famous"
'Cause you know I'm gonna change ya
But I still stayed loyal, only want what's best for you
Back it up, new Ranger Rover, I'ma back it up
Get a likkle money, seh mi change, I'm acting up
Back it up, stop complain and mek we live it up
Can't deal with the fame then baby, then give it up
'Cause money change people, fame really change people
The game really people

[Chorus: French Montana & (Hoodcelebrityy)]
Even though the world was meant for you (even though the world was meant for you)
I hope you don't get famous (hope you don't get famous)
'Cause everyone will love you but won't love you like I do, oh nah (nah go love yuh, nah go love yuh, nah go love)
Hope you don't get famous (hope you never get famous)
Stay home with me (stay home, stay home)
Stay home with me (stay home, stay home)
I'll always love ya, I'll always
Hope you don't get
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous (hope you never get famous)
Hope you don't get famous (yeah)
Hope you don't get famous
Yeah (please don't get famous, please don't get famous)

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Baby live your life, just how you are
Shining star
Hope you never get famous
Flying low with the angels
They said "fake it 'till you make it"
I guess you fake when you make it
I told you "stick to the basics"
Built an empire started from the basement
If you tryna fix a glass that's broken
You know it might cut ya hand
Never want to see you with another man
Truth might eat you if you're mumbling
When it get too cold for a blanket
Need you hugging me
Because nobody gonna love you like I do

[Chorus: French Montana]
Even though the world was meant for you
I hope you don't get famous
'Cause everyone will love you but won't love you like the way I do, oh nah
Hope you don't get famous
Stay home with me
Stay home with me
I'll always love ya, I'll always
Hope you don't get
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Yeah

[Bridge: French Montana]
All day long, I stand by you
Right or wrong, I stand by you
Keep me strong, oh girl it's true
Keep me strong, oh girl it's true

[Chorus: French Montana]
Even though the world was meant for you
I hope you don't get famous
'Cause everyone will love you but won't love you like I do, oh nah
Hope you don't get famous
Stay home with me
Stay home with me
I'll always love ya, I'll always
Hope you don't get
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
