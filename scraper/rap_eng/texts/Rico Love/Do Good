[Verse 2]
Love you way to much to make you cry
Only wish you felt the way that I do
Cause if you did I wouldn't be going though
Night after night, lie after lie
She must know something that I don't
Go head and live you life now

[Chorus]
I hope you do good my nigga
I hope find you in love
I hope do better with her
I hope it's better than us
I hope you don't find another crazy one
Cause Lord know that I was
I hope you do good my nigga
Cause my good wasn't good enough

No hate in blood
Go head boy I wish you nothing but love
Maybe I should be alone
Cause I'm not the one you want
No hate in blood
Go head boy I wish you nothing but love
I'm hoping that you find someone cause you was never mine

[Refrain]
Cause you never mine
Cause you never mine
Cause you never mine
Cause you never mine
