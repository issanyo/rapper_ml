[Verse 1]
Lights on, stage set
I guess I gotta put on a show again cause everyone's waiting
Females, fly jets
When I turn the radio on, I hear all my songs playing

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever money can buy, I probably got it
And that's real talk, yeah
I see my name in the sky all over the world
And I just sit here saying

[Chorus]
Lucky me, I gotta pose for the cameras
Even when my world's falling down, I still wear a smile
Lucky me, even though I'm so damaged
Gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd
Lucky me, I pray none of my loved ones wanna be stars
Cause nobody said it'd be so hard
Wouldn't put this on no one else
Yeah, lucky me

[Verse 2]
So exclusive
I don't have to wait in the line, it's like the club is mine now
If it was only that simple
Then what I'm saying is easy to do and we know that's not true, oh nah

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever money can buy, I probably got it
And that's real talk, yeah
I see my name in the sky all over the world
And I just sit here saying

[Chorus]
Lucky me, I gotta pose for the cameras
Even when my world's falling down, I still wear a smile
Lucky me, even though I'm so damaged
Gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd
Lucky me, I pray none of my loved ones wanna be stars
Cause nobody said it'd be so hard
Wouldn't put this on no one else
Yeah, lucky me

[Bridge]
My dream and it's my heart, the life of being a star
You don't even know how hard it is, do you? Yeah
Now I'm thankful for everything and I'm finally becoming a man
Now I gotta bigger show to do

[Chorus]
Lucky me, I gotta pose for the cameras
Even when my world's falling down, I still wear a smile
Lucky me, even though I'm so damaged
Gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd
Lucky me, I pray none of my loved ones wanna be stars
Cause nobody said it'd be so hard
Wouldn't put this on no one else
Yeah, lucky me
