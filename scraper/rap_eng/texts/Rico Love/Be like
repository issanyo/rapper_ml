You were always the life of the party
But when you go and give yo life to somebody
It's like you find more pain than pleasure
You know you can't play that game forever
How long you gon' carry on, carry on like this?
Different city every night still lookin' for a nigga who gon' wife it
((Bitches be like) Hair done, nails done
But I ain't got nowhere to stay
(Bitches be like) Tonight I'm gon' kill 'em
Takin' pictures with no filter
(Bitches be like) Uh it's a lot of rich niggas in the club
I'mma make one of these niggas fall in love
(Bitches be like) These, these bitches be like
These, these bitches be like (Bitches be like)
Uh, you've been tryna do it since '92
That pussy sick now, you got vagina flu
Fuck you tryin' to do? You ain't from DC
But you had the million man march up inside of you
Word to them rubbers in yo trash can
OG's and they younger brothers broke that ass in
Damn! These bitches be like
Poke my ass out and that's 150 likes
Rocked 150 mics
But only backstage, we just here for the night
No talent but she know Jimmy Fallon
No house, no car but she be stylin'
(Bitches be like) Hair done, nails done
But I ain't got nowhere to stay
(Bitches be like) Tonight I'm gon' kill 'em
Takin' pictures with no filter
(Bitches be like) Uh it's a lot of rich niggas in the club
I'mma make one of these niggas fall in love
(Bitches be like) These, these bitches be like
These, these bitches be like (Bitches be like)
But I know somewhere out there, there's a nigga who loves you
These, these bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
Even though somewhere out there there's a lot of niggas who've worked you
These, these bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
Now I ain't judging, I just tell it how it is
You know what you do, you know what you did
You be takin' trips, you won't be wit yo kid
They don't be wit you, they be at yo mama crib
While you be getting flipped
(Bitches be like) Hair done, nails done
But I ain't got nowhere to stay
(Bitches be like) Tonight I'm gon' kill 'em
Takin' pictures with no filter
(Bitches be like) Uh it's a lot of rich niggas in the club
I'mma make one of these niggas fall in love
(Bitches be like) These, these bitches be like
These, these bitches be like (Bitches be like)
