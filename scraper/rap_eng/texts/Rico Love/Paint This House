[Verse 1]
I ain't even close to leaving this house
There's still so many rooms left to cover
And there ain't no reason for you to ever be without
Memories of me and my love

[Chorus]
And I want these stairs, those walls
Kitchen counters, and those chairs
To remind you of how good it feels
And all of these floors and ceilings
And every hallway (yeah)
Not and inch will go untouched
Let's paint this house with our love (our love)

[Verse 2]
I'll just lay while you stroke, you putting it down
Damn you showing all your colors
The wildest thoughts are provoking
It's like you're in my head right now (now, my head)
'Cause you know me like no other

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Cancel the decorator
We don't need no help
You'll pick out the colors
We'll clean up the mess later
We do it so well, loving one another
In the closet, on the facets, in the balconies
Anywhere you are inside this house
You'll, think of me yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]

Let's paint this house with our love (our love)
Our Love (our love)
Let's Paint this house with our love (love)
Let's paint this house with our love (our love)
