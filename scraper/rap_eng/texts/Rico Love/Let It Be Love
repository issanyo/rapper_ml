(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 1: J Sutta]
Is it you, the love that I've been waitin' for?
Call my name, say it loud and clear
Is it true that I don't have to wait no more?
Cause until I hear your voice, I'll be here
I swear I ain't go other way

[Chorus: J Sutta]
Someone's knocking at the door right now
Dear God, please let it be love
So long I've been waiting for right now
Oh God, please let it be love
Let it be love (let it, let it, let it be love, love, love)
Dear God, let it be love (let it, let it, let it be love, love, love)
Dear God, why can't you let it be love?

[Verse 2: J Sutta]
Can you please, give me a sign tell me you real
A part of me, thinks I'm hearin' things
Wanna believe, I swear it's like I can almost feel, almost feel
But if I open up my heart then I reveal
Wounds that only love can heal

[Chorus: J Sutta]
Someone's knocking at the door right now
Dear God, please let it be love
So long I've been waiting for right now
Oh God, please let it be love
Let it be love (let it, let it, let it be love, love, love)
Dear God, let it be love (let it, let it, let it be love, love, love)
Dear God, why can't you let it be love

[Verse 3: Rico Love]
It's alright, don't keep me hittin' and results may vary
All I need is you, me and a stereo
Someone's knocking at the door right now
Someone's close to be all on the floor right now
Can you guess who?
Yes you, you should be so blissful
And I ain't even met you but I already miss you
I guess Cupid be on that bullshit
You need to get a pistol
A grenade or a missile
Can't wait til I get you
We can make it official

[Chorus: J Sutta]
Someone's knocking at the door right now
Dear God, please let it be love
So long I've been waiting for right now
Oh God, please let it be love
Let it be love (let it, let it, let it be love, love, love)
Dear God, let it be love (let it, let it, let it be love, love, love)
Dear God, why can't you let it be love?
