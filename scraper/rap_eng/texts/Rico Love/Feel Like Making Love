[Verse 1]
Are we there yet?
Are we at the point where we don't wanna speak?
Are you comfortable sleeping alone?
Do you not think of me?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe you can't get past
How bad I hurt you deep
Maybe you finally found your peace
But...

[Chorus}
But if you ever feel like making love
Don't you hesitate, to call me up
If you ever feel like making love
Even if you don't want to make up
I won't change my number babe, stay in touch
If you ever feel like making love
If you ever feel like making love
If you ever feel like making love

[Verse 2]
Are you scared yet?
Afraid of your lonely heartbeat?
Are you ready to pick up the phone?
Even if it's only to hear me breathe?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know that I was wrong
I know I hurt you deep
Maybe you're okay without me
But!

[Chorus}
But if you ever feel like making love
Don't you hesitate, to call me up
If you ever feel like making love
Even if you don't want to make up
I won't change my number babe, stay in touch
If you ever feel like making love
If you ever feel like making love
If you ever feel like making love

[Bridge]
I'm just hopin'
That I haven't lost all your trust
Because it's hard for us, to do this thing alone
Sometimes I don't wanna be, on my own!

[Chorus}
But if you ever feel like making love
Don't you hesitate, to call me up
If you ever feel like making love
Even if you don't want to make up
I won't change my number babe, stay in touch
If you ever feel like making love
If you ever feel like making love
