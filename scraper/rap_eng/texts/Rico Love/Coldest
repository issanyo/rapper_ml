[Intro]
It's a dope ass feeling when you ridin' around
And you seein' everybody with they girl
And you can just smile and think to yourself
My shawty is the coldest

[Verse 1]
Don't gotta beg for it, don't gotta ask twice
Don't gotta worry bout nothin', girl, you can pack lights

[Pre-Hook]
I ain't gotta tell 'em that you buy your own bags and shoes, you supposed to
But it gotta feel good knowing that a real nigga's right there that'll hold you down
I ain't scared to say that I got you now (I swear, you the coldest)

[Hook]
Even when you out of town, when you touch down
When you touch down, you be the
Coldest bitch in the city, coldest bitch in the city, coldest bitch in the (x3)
Even when you out of town, when you touch down
When you touch down, you be the
Coldest bitch in the city, coldest bitch in the city, coldest bitch in the (x2)
Coldest bitch in the city, coldest bitch in the city, coldest bitch in the, coldest bitch in the

[Verse 2]
Yeah, 12 Play on repeat
When she run around these streets, Zanotti on her feet
And when you see her, my nigga
When you see her, my nigga, just know that's me
And can't nobody round here say they hit her, yeah

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Interlude]
I ain't even gon' hold you
She know what it is with me
She know a nigga have the money
But she ain't never asking me for shit
Everything I did for her is cause I wanted to
She the motherfuckin' coldest

[Pre-Hook + Hook]
