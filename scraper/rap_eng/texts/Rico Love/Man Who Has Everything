[Verse 1:]
Hard, hard
Hard living
Always jumping
Always steeping
Always giving
Your jewelry and your cars

They satisfy these women
Or should I say girls
Cause they're all around like children
But that ain't what you need, no, no

[Chorus:]
You deserve to love someone
Who's gonna love you back
(Love you back, boy)
Cause even a man who has everything
Still needs something money can't buy

Maybe you deserve someone
Who's gonna have your back
A woman who has her own
And don't need nothing
Nothing but you, baby

[Verse 2:]
But the question is
Can you give that, baby?
Can you share your feelings?

Keep all your money
And give up your heart
Cause it's never been easy, no, no
I think me requires
More than your credit card
But you gon' get just what you pay for

[Chorus:]
You deserve to love someone
Who's gonna love you back
(Oh, oh, oh, yeah)
Cause even a man who has everything
Still needs something money can't buy

Maybe you deserve
Someone who's gonna have your back
A woman who has her own
And don't need nothing
Nothing but you, baby

[Bridge:]
Someone to push your heart to the limit
Yeah, yeah
Someone who knows when you're hurting
And how to make it better

Need somebody
Who gon' tell the truth, baby
Even when your own day come steady
Stay with you forever

[Chorus:]
You deserve to love someone
Who's gonna love you back
(Oh, oh, oh, yeah)
'Cause a man who has everything
Still needs something money can't buy
(You need it baby)

Maybe you deserve
Someone who's gonna have your back
A woman who has her own
And don't need nothing
Nothing but you, baby

You deserve to love someone
Who's gonna love you back
(You, you, you, you, uh
Nothing but you, baby)
Cause even a man who has everything
Still needs something money can't buy

Maybe you deserve someone
Who's gonna have your back
A woman who has her own
And don't need nothing
Nothing but you, baby
Nothing but you, baby
