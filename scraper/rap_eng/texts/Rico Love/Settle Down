[Intro: Rico Love (Girl)]
(Look at dude!) Corna Boyz
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Oh! Oh!
U.S
Oh! Oh!
Uh-huh, talk to me, babe!
(Ooh-ah-hah, ooh-ah-hah) Oh!
(Ooh-ah-hah, ooh-ah-hah) Oh!
(Ooh-ah-hah, ooh-ah-hah) What's my name, girl?
(Ri-co Love, oh!)

[Verse 1]
Been the boss since the last time you saw me
And if you ain't never saw me, then maybe, baby, you're lost!
White shell-toes, shirt says "Lacoste,"
Plus I'm gettin' bread like Moss, watch me!
I think I'm 'bout to chrome out the watch
Got a cross full of stones, so I'm glowin' when I walk!
22 but I'm cool
Old heads say I'm young but you can tell I'm grown when I talk!
Off the damn hook!
I don't follow rules, I toss the damn book
I'm flossin', man, look!

[Bridge]
So when I come around and you niggas wanna clown
Please, don't blame me, partner, tell your girl "Settle down!"

[Hook: Rico Love (Girl)]
Settle down, settle down, settle down now
Settle down, settle down, settle down now
Settle down, settle down, settle down now
Settle down now, wind to the bassline!
(You got it goin', got it goin', got it goin' goin'
You got it goin', gotta get get goin', goin'
You got it goin', got it goin', got it goin' on
Ri-co Love, oh!)

[Verse 2]
I know you've seen my car, know you've seen how clean I are
How fly I is, wishin' you can get a guy like this
If you're good, maybe later you can try my dick!
Yeah, I live like a rockstar
And I'm straight from the block, but I got a couple records on the pop charts
Ride in the 'Bach, I keep three stripes on the side of the box
Plus the size of my watch!
I make a broke nigga wanna rise to the top
Keep stacks on me, I ain't gotta hide from the cops!

[Bridge]
So when I come around and you niggas wanna clown
Please, don't blame me, partner, tell your girl "Settle down!"

[Hook: Rico Love (Girl)]
Settle down, settle down, settle down now
Settle down, settle down, settle down now
Settle down, settle down, settle down now
Settle down now, wind to the bassline!
(You got it goin', got it goin', got it goin' goin'
You got it goin', gotta get get goin', goin'
You got it goin', got it goin', got it goin' on
Ri-co Love, oh!)

[Verse 3]
I go for bread
Stacks look like I wrapped a rubber band 'round a loaf of bread!
Money ain't a thing, you can tell by the chains
I keep it laid out like a sofa bed!
I'm so S-E-X-Y in the Lex
I'm rich, bitch, uh, you can tell by my checks!
Ice in my veins by the side of my neck
And chicks bow to me as a sign of respect!
Yep, the Mil dude still rude in the Hummer
The flow make the whole room move like some thunder!

[Bridge]
So when I come around and you niggas wanna clown
Please, don't blame me, partner, tell your girl "Settle down!"

[Hook: Rico Love (Girl)]
Settle down, settle down, settle down now
Settle down, settle down, settle down now
Settle down, settle down, settle down now
Settle down now, wind to the bassline!
(You got it goin', got it goin', got it goin' goin'
You got it goin', gotta get get goin', goin'
You got it goin', got it goin', got it goin' on
Ri-co Love, oh!)

Settle down, settle down, settle down now
Settle down, settle down, settle down now
Settle down, settle down, settle down now
Settle down now, wind to the bassline!
(You got it goin', got it goin', got it goin' goin'
You got it goin', gotta get get goin', goin'
You got it goin', got it goin', got it goin' on
Ri-co Love, oh!)

[Outro]
(Ooh-ah-hah, ooh-ah-hah) Yeah, if you feel good, baby let me hear you say
(Ooh-ah-hah, ooh-ah-hah) Feel real good, baby, let me hear you say
(Ooh-ah-hah, ooh-ah-hah) If you feel good baby, let me hear you say
(Ooh-ah-hah, ooh-ah-hah, Ri-co Love!)
That's my name, baby!

Corna Boyz, Crownworld, Division 1
