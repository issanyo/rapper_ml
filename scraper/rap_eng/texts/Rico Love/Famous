[Intro]
Stay home with me, stay home with me
I'll always love you
Stay home with me, stay home with me
I'll always love you

[Verse 1]
Hope no one discovers you
Hope no one sees it
I hope no one falls in love with you
And I've got my reasons
Cause if they knew what I know
Then I know that I wouldn't stand a chance
There's no way you would go for a man like me if you had  options

[Chorus]
And even though the world was made for you
I hope you don't get famous
Cause everyone will love you but won't love you like I do
I hope you don't get famous
Stay home with me, stay home with me
I'll always love you, I'll always
Stay home with me, stay home with me
I'll always love you, I'll always
Hope you don't get famous, hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous, hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous, hope you don't get famous

[Verse 2]
I lie with you
I cry with you
My times with you
My life it's true it all belongs to you
Everything is right and wrong with you
Every melody and song is you
And I love that you're not hard to get to
And I'll admit you control my mind
And I know you'll find someone way better
But they could never treat you better

[Chorus]
And even though the world will stand for you
I hope you don't get famous
Cause everyone will love you but won't love you like I do
I hope you don't get famous
Stay home with me, stay home with me
I'll always love you, I'll always
Stay home with me, stay home with me
I'll always love you, I'll always
Hope you don't get famous, hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous, hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous, hope you don't get famous

[Bridge]
My whole life long I'll stay by you
Right or wrong I'll stay by you
Keep me strong oh girl it's true
Keep me strong oh girl it's true
My whole life long I'll stay by you
Right or wrong I'll stay by you
Keep me strong oh girl it's true
Keep me strong oh girl it's true

[Chorus]
Stay home with me, stay home with me
I'll always love you, I'll always
Stay home with me, stay home with me
I'll always love you, I'll always
Hope you don't get famous, hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous, hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous, hope you don't get famous
