Sometimes just won't do it
Shopping sprees might make me smile for now
But what about later?
And I don't mean to put you through it
I just wanna know I'm caring for
I wanna know you there, boy

And if you love me
Tell me that you love me
I need to hear those words
Before I go to bed, my baby, baby
I make it easy, baby
I just want you to need me

I gotta feel your touch
Taste your kiss
Hear your voice in my head
And I promise to be good
Daddy's good girl

You ain't gonna hear nothing 'bout me
Hanging late up in these streets
Promise to be good
Daddy's good girl, daddy's good, girl
Long as I know
You got that love for me
I'ma be G-O-O-D
I'ma be G-O-O-D

And I swear
You found the truest
No need to question it
I hold you down cause I've had plenty takers

And a few times
You almost blew it, baby
But you showed me I was cared for
So I'll be here, boy

And if you love me, tell me that you love me
I need to hear those words
Before I go to bed, my baby, baby
I make it easy, baby
I just want you to need me

I gotta feel your touch
Taste your kiss
Hear your voice in my head
And I promise to be good
Daddy's good girl

You ain't gonna hear nothing 'bout me
Hanging late up in these streets
Promise to be good
Daddy's good girl
Daddy's good, girl

Long as I know
You got that love for me
I'ma be G-O-O-D
All a good girl needs is loving
She G-O-O-D

And I bet you make her smile, baby
And she won't leave you for, for nothing
Nothing in this world
Could take her love away

And if you love me
Tell me that you love me
I need to hear those words
Before I go to bed, my baby, baby
I make it easy, baby
I just want you to need me

I gotta feel your touch
Taste your kiss
Hear your voice in my head
And I promise to be good
Daddy's good girl

You ain't gonna hear nothing 'bout me
Hanging late up in these streets
Promise to be good
Daddy's good girl
Daddy's good, girl

Long as I know
You got that love for me
I'ma be G-O-O-D
I'ma be G-O-O-D
