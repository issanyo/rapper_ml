[Verse 1: Nelly]
Yea I drink ciroc cause I fuck with puff
I pop that ace of spade because I rock with jay
I'm on that cali good but I'm not in l.a
I'm somewhere halfway between there and the bay
I like them broosy bras I like round the way
I take them outta they js put them in hermays
Might hang out in the club might chill out somewhere safer
Kinkos and Office Max I love to hang with paper
My crib is plush plush I'm talking elevator
So don't touch touch don't feed the alligator
You fly right my fly is greater
Multiply the money add the bitches subtract the haters
She said

[Chorus: Sophie Green]
I don't want no broke niggas no no
I don't want no broke niggas no no
If you ain't got no money then you can't do nothing for me
If you ain't got no money then you can't do nothing for me
In vegas l.a. MIA new york yea I like shoppin
If you can handle all of that then we can get it poppin
I don't want no broke niggas no no
I want the type of nigga who know how to ba-all

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
You don't no broke nigga I don't want no broke bitch
Thought about it good quick I get it we on the same shit
She want me to wife her maybe change her life up
Give the keys and shopping sprees yea only if I like her
See money ain't the object let's get it clear
This is not a gift it's a souvenir
See maybe I'm that nigga who knows how to ball
I am hes thug will hight the money tall
I'm off his and hers
Bodys straight hips and curves
Friends hanging near trying to tell 'em I don't want your girls
Back off I'm from another world
Money do not grow on trees
That's why I had to hustle her and get my paper out da streets

[Chorus: Sophie Green]
I don't want no broke niggas no no
I don't want no broke niggas no no
If you ain't got no money then you can't do nothing for me
If you ain't got no money then you can't do nothing for me
In vegas l.a. MIA new york yea I like shoppin
If you can handle all of that then we can get it poppin
Cause I don't want no broke niggas no no
I want the type of nigga who know how to ba-all

[Verse 3: Nelly]
My money long my money strong bitch I'm booked to paid
I'm throwing shots back like it's k-k-kool aid
I got them co coo shades
Them shit is crazy dawg
I got two shawtys feeling on each others lady parts
Play your part know your role
That mustang cold painted olympic gold
I call her elenor you know that she'll be rips
I'm gone in 60 ticks
T-t-t-t-ticks
Before my deal I cut by 60 chicks
Acrobactics got my money turning 60 flips
Old school id be on that 60s shit
My nigga gone forever and t.i.p is 60s rip

[Chorus: Sophie Green]
I don't want no broke niggas no no
I don't want no broke niggas no no
If you ain't got no money then you can't do nothing for me
If you ain't got no money then you can't do nothing for me
In vegas l.a. MIA new york yea I like shoppin
If you can handle all of that then we can get it poppin
Cause I don't want no broke niggas no no
I want the type of nigga who know how to ba-all
