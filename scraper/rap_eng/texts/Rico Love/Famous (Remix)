[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah
Fame is a lie
Nothing that money can buy
Means more than this
Yeah, yeah
You wanna be under the lights
So dance under the sky
Now with me

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause I need you when I wake up
Need you when my day's up
You're right there, you're out here
My right hand on ya
I don't wanna see you face up
'Cause then I'll come and chase ya
I like it, but I can't
Share you, no

[Chorus: French Montana & Adam Levine]
Even though the world was meant for you
I hope you don't get famous
'Cause everyone will love you
But won't love you like I do, oh nah
Hope you don't get famous
(hope you don't get famous)
Stay home with me
Stay home with me
I'll always love ya, I'll always
Hope you don't get
Hope you don't get famous

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I hope no one discovers you
Hope no one sees her
I hope no one falls in love with you
I've got my reasons
'Cause if they knew what I know
Then I know I wouldn't stand a chance
There's no way you would go
For a man like me if you had options

[Chorus: French Montana & Adam Levine]
Even though the world was meant for you
I hope you don't get famous
'Cause everyone will love you
But won't love you like I do, oh nah
Hope you don't get famous
(hope you don't get famous)
Stay home with me
Stay home with me
I'll always love ya, I'll always
Hope you don't get
Hope you don't get famous

[Post-Chorus: French Montana & Adam Levine]
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Yeah, hope you don't get
Stay home

[Bridge: French Montana]
All day long I stand by you
Right or wrong I stand by you
Keep me strong, oh girl it's true
Keep me strong, oh girl it's true

[Chorus: French Montana & Adam Levine]
Even though the world was meant for you
I hope you don't get famous (yeah)
'Cause everyone will love you
But won't love you like I do, oh nah
Hope you don't get famous
(hope you don't get famous)
Stay home with me
Stay home with me
I'll always love ya, I'll always
Hope you don't get
Hope you don't get famous
(Yeah)

[Outro: Adam Levine]
Hope you don't get famous
(Yeah, yeah)
