[Verse 1 - Junglepussy]
You want me when you need me you me to be your trophy yea
Wifey in the kitchen whipping macaroni yea
Not you homie but you want me home alone and yea
Call you celly and you don't pick up your phone and yea
Tap me, I'm spicy your friends don't like me
Cause they pop bottles that don't entice me
This is not a threat boo I'm just enlighten
Turn your speakers up so you can hear me nicely
I think he wanna wife it
Cause the cake is sitting right like he like, (right)
In the middle of night lit
Who the one by your side like a light switch
[Everthing is bigger - Rico Love]
Money on my mind looking like a bag
Looking like the best thing that you ever had
He don't go to the store no more
I'm the snack in the store he was looking for, (right)

[Chorus - TXS]
Don't tempt me
Don't think that I'm young and afraid don't be full of yourself
You might leave empty
(I won't be)
I won't be another notch on your belt
Don't tempt me
I'm nothing like the women who chase ya
(I'll make you come get me)
I won't be a trophy that you could sit on the shelf
(Don't make me do it)
Don't tempt me

[Refrain - Junglepussy]
Right

[Verse 2 - TXS]
I ain't gonna let you play yourself
I'm giving a chance to save yourself
I know my way around the bedroom
Every single part of me will be felt
Baby I don't wanna make a fool of ya
Trying my best not let loose on ya

[Chrous]
Don't tempt me
Don't think that I'm young and afraid don't be full of yourself
You might leave empty
(I won't be)
I won't be another notch on your belt
Don't tempt me
I'm nothing like the women who chase ya
(I'll make you come get me), oh

(Don't make me do it)
Don't tempt me

[Bridge - TXS]
Don't wanna see ya lose your head
Maybe I should back up instead
So many places I can take you
(Don't do something that you'll regret)
I don't want to see you acting bad yea
No I'll be the best that you ever had yea

[Chrous]
Don't tempt me
Don't think that I'm young and afraid don't be full of yourself
You might leave empty

I won't be another notch on your belt
Don't tempt me
I'm nothing like the women who chase ya
(I'll make you come get me)
I won't be a trophy that you could sit on the shelf
(Don't make me do it)
Don't tempt me
