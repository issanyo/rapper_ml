[Verse 1: S-X]
I do not need this
I know why I
These are the reasons, the reasons why
I know it's for me, this temporary
Shit here won't last
I'ma make it fast
I said it, didn't mean it
I'ma prove you wrong
I can make things right
I don't care how long
I can see the light
And I'm feeling right
I know what I'm worth
It's more than a price

[Chorus: S-X]
Something better there's gotta be for you and me
Something better there's gotta be I put you and me
Something better, there's gotta be for you and me
Something better for you and me or for you and me

[Verse 2: Lily Allen]
Give me something to believe in
I don't feel good enough
This life that I've been leading
I might be giving up

[Chorus: S-X]
Something better there's gotta be for you and me
Something better there's gotta be I put you and me
Something better, there's gotta be for you and me
Something better

[Refrain: S-X]
Even if it's just a dream
Even if I'm left to dream
Even if it's just a dream
Even if I'm left to dream

[Bridge: Lily Allen]
You got so many questions which can only mean
You can't talk any lies
I'm no reaching for your attention
By your eyes on me for a lifetime

[Chorus: S-X]
Something better there's gotta be for you and me
Something better there's gotta be I put you and me
Something better, there's gotta be for you and me
Something better

[Refrain: S-X]
Even if it's just a dream
Even if I'm left to dream
Even if it's just a dream
Even if I'm left to dream
