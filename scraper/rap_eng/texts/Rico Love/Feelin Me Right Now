[Verse 1]
You're the only one I see
It's like no one's in the V.I.P. but you and me
I know which bed I'm in tonight, baby
So don't you leave without my handcuffs
I made some special plans for us tonight
Oh, you're just my type, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
So back, back, back it up, you're the one I got my eye on
Don't give me your number, it's already in my iPhone
I just want you close, close, close, close, nearer
Been watching you all night up in the mirror

[Chorus]
I'm so feeling me right now
Think I fell in love, fell in love in the club tonight
I'm so feeling me right now
I wanna take her home, take her home tonight 'cause I know I'll love her right
I'm so feeling me right now
I know I'm good
I can buy my own, I drive my own right now
That's why I really fell in love in the club tonight
I'm so feeling me right now

28's, Giovanni, she don't need no Clyde
Tonight she alright, she so Bonnie
So buying champagne won't have her running
She covers her own tab
Feeling great, looking like money
She ain't scared to spend it, she be stunting on you dummies
So I can understand why one would fall in love, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So back, back, back it up, you're the one I got my eye on
Don't give me your number, it's already in my iPhone
I just want you close, close, close, close, nearer
Been watching you all night up in the mirror

[Chorus]
I'm so feeling me right now
Think I fell in love, fell in love in the club tonight
I'm so feeling me right now
I wanna take her home, take her home tonight 'cause I know I'll love her right
I'm so feeling me right now
I know I'm good
I can buy my own, I drive my own right now
That's why I really fell in love in the club tonight
I'm so feeling me right now

[Bridge]
I don't wanna hear nothing from nobody when the club ends
Cause there's a pretty girl who's driving me home
(Because we're better than you)
She feeling me, been feeling me way too long
If feeling her ain't right, then I guess I'm way too wrong
Cause can't nobody match this loving
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So back, back, back it up, you're the one I got my eye on
Don't give me your number, it's already in my iPhone
I just want you close, close, close, close, nearer
Been watching you all night up in the mirror

[Chorus]
I'm so feeling me right now
Think I fell in love, fell in love in the club tonight
I'm so feeling me right now
I wanna take her home, take her home tonight 'cause I know I'll love her right
I'm so feeling me right now
I know I'm good
I can buy my own, I drive my own right now
That's why I really fell in love in the club tonight
I'm so feeling me right now
