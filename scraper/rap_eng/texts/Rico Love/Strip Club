Wish I could turn my hotel into strip club
I'd invite everybody
Wish I could turn my hotel into a strip club
And have all those women 'round me

[Verse 1]
Dime Piece she from Memphis
J Blaze be in H-Town
My girl Dior she don't dance no more
But she cool as fuck cause she stay down
I should send a G5 to D.C
Fill it up with them girls from the Stadium
Cause D-Town like Britsh
And I'm sure it's some shit she could say to him
You got Reds, you got Lisha, Caliente, Trisha
And I don't think I know her stage name
But the bitch so bad you might kiss her
What about that A-Town, Magic City, OG
I spent so many hundreds
All them bitches know me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Remy Red be in K.O.D and she be climbing up that pole
Plus her ass so swole
Can't forget just Britanny
I seen a nigga spend 60
And he still ain't get that number
Gave her his and said, "You gone hit me"?
You got Liquid, you got Bird
They don't rock bags, they don't rock furs
They just stack they money high
They both got houses in the burbs
Can't forget Jazz, even though we be beefing
But I'ma get bout 20 racks and spend it on her this weekend

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Damn I miss that Jazzy T's
Damn I miss Club Nikki's
I was 17 at the Blue of Flame up in the gentleman's club getting tipsy
Damn I miss White Chocolate
Anybody seen Sugar
If I was having money back then
Swear to God I'd have took her
Na Na, Irene the Dream
I seen them turn rich niggas into fiends
I hit Boy Toy when I was 20
She told a young nigga whole lotta' things
Made a nigga wanna get rich
And on nights like this
Sit in my hotel room and I reminisce

[Hook]
