[Intro: Rico Love]
Turn the lights on

[Verse 1: JAHKOY]
Seems like all these girls are perfect
All these girls are perfect
In LA, in LA
They've got so much there to purchase
All those labels on their purses
In LA, in LA

[Pre-Chorus: JAHKOY]
You ain't gotta die
Just go buy you a plane ticket
(plane ticket, pla-plane ticket)
This place will change your life
Ask the guys who just came to visit
Once they came, they just can't go nowhere

[Chorus: JAHKOY]
Heaven must be somewhere in California
No place I've seen compares to California
There's nothing but angels out there
A place filled with angels I swear
They say come and join us
The weathers much warmer
Heaven's california
Heaven's california

[Chorus: JAHKOY]
Heaven must be somewhere in California
No place I've seen compares to California
There's nothing but angels out there
A place filled with angels I swear
They say come and join us
The weathers much warmer
Heaven's california
Heaven's california

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Tell me you love me a little bit
Wanna feel like life's really innocent
My situation with women is quite perplexing
I can't get rid of this
Past perception, it's heavy - really is
In our artifice but regardless, man
She went by to this place we stay
Smile like sunshine, waist like the waves
Live my days walkin' on the sand
Said, "this area gets dangerous."
Can you tell me, what's your plan right now?
Anyway, it's the promised land
Let me know, we can go right now
Side-by-side, walking hand-in-hand
All the things we was told we need
Pray the ocean breeze set us free
If not, let's make the most of we
Make it last for life, hopefully
If not, we gave it all we got
And that's from the heart

[Verse 3: JAHKOY]
Man they party on the week days (count it)
Party on the week days (count it, count it, count it, count it)
In LA, in LA
I swear they know all the DJs
Walk in the club and don't pay
Man they must be so paid
Okay, in LA
They poppin in LA

[Pre-Chorus: JAHKOY]
You ain't gotta die
Just go buy you a plane ticket
(plane ticket, pla-plane ticket)
This place will change your life
Ask the guys who just came to visit
Once they came, they just can't go nowhere

[Chorus: JAHKOY]
Heaven must be somewhere in California
No place I've seen compares to California
There's nothing but angels out there
A place filled with angels i swear
They say come and join us
The weathers much warmer
Heaven's california

They say come and join us
The weathers much warmer
Heaven's california
Heaven's california
