I'm breathing you like my air now
Got me floatin' like I'm outer space
And I can't lose with you here now
There's no one that can dare take your place
'Cuz your worth every argument
Every battle proves its scar
So far from perfect
But you've been perfect so far
Still not speaking
And you're still over there
On your side of the bed
Still disagreeing
And the tension that we share
It hurts beyond compare
But the crazy thing about love
Is how far it goes, how deep it runs
And I'm still here just because
I refuse to let this keep me from, baby
I'm breathing you like my air now
Got me floatin' like I'm outer space
And I can't lose with you here now
There's no one that can dare take your place
'Cuz your worth every argument
Every battle proves its scar
So far from perfect
But you've been perfect so far
Still my baby
And I know where I belong
Is right inside your arms
Ain't no other place for me
Got me right where you want me
You ain't perfect but you're so perfect for me
But the crazy thing about love
Is how far it goes, how deep it runs
And I'm still here just because
I refuse to let this keep me from, baby
I'm breathing you like my air now
Got me floatin' like I'm outer space
And I can't lose with you here now
There's no one that can dare take your place
'Cuz your worth every argument
Every battle proves its scar
So far from perfect
But you've been perfect so far
We may fight a little bit, baby
Sometimes, we won't speak for days
And that's fine, 'cuz I know you'll be right back by my side
Still got that love that I crave
And that lets me know we're okay
'Cuz you're my baby and I'm your lady
Turn the lights on
I'm breathing you like my air now
Got me floatin' like I'm outer space
And I can't lose with you here now
There's no one that can dare take your place
'Cuz your worth every argument
Every battle proves its scar
So far from perfect
But you've been perfect so far
So far from perfect
But you've been perfect so far
