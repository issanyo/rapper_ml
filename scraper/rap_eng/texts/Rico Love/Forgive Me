[Hook x2]
(Forgive me) I’m too sexy in the morning time
Talking bout he gotta go, but he wanna stay and grind
(Forgive me) I’m too sexy in the morning time
Knowing that he gotta go, but he wanna stay and grind

[Verse 1]
I’m sorry for being so fly
I didn't mean to row by and catch the eye of your guy
You know I keep em up rock like coke and baking soda
That’s why I’m taking over
He's mine but she can’t get I’m off the sofa
Plus I’m the closest thing to Oprah
Billionaire chick, plus I got that fire chocha
That’s no lie, I put my number in his Motorola
And since then it’s been over, so apologies in order
I’m just hoping you

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I’m wondering if I should tell him yes
I know his girl hating on me, but she better rest
I know she wishing that I chill, I’ma let her sweat
Cause now she study in my office like Belichick
I’m a victim of high life, somebody gonna fizz
It costs a lot of bread just to get me out of bed
And I know that he be trying, but he can’t get me out his head
Killing em is a crime, but remember when I said to

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x2]
You know you're sexy in the morning
You know what’s right feels nice when it started
He never leave ‘cause your body keep calling
Pick up the ? but he can’t stop stalling
(Again)
