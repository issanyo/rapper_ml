[Hook 1: Rico Love]
I'll freak you right I will, I'll freak you right I will
I'll freak you like no one has ever ever made you feel

[Verse 1: Rico Love]
Wrote some songs and made some mills, did some couple major deals
Been around the world somehow I never been to Asia still
And your mothers Asian right? Or your fathers side or something
I'm thinking you can stay the night, and we can organise a function
She said "you the one to sing 'they don't know' I'm no side bitch"
Then she met my bitch and learned we don't nothing private
I ain't texting on the low, she told me what to type
She say "you should tell that Asian girl, bring her clothes and stay the night"
Sip Merlot 'till you get raised

[Hook 2: Rico Love]
Our business is our business and I'm still your favourite, you still a fan
I got a girl, but I'm still your man
Cause those hoes gonna' judge you anyway
Might as well enjoy yourself
They gonna' judge you anyway
Live life for yourself girl
I said i got a girl but I'm still your man
I got a girl but I'm still your man
Our business is our business and I'm still your favourite, you still a fan
These hoes gonna' judge you anyway, these hoes gonna' love you anyway
We don't love those hoes either

Turn the lights on

[Hook 1: Rico Love]

[Verse 2: Rico Love]
Flashing lights, watch they reveal, at the flights in Vegas still
Plus my baby mama told our girlfriend 'she should stay and chill'
Trill shit that niggas rap about
Old rapping ass, we sit back and laugh about their fairy tales
So fictional, so carnival, so carousel
They spew verses about a lifestyle I know very well
And innocence, your innocence is more intimate and lets use to our benefit
I know plenty chicks that want to spend these chips
But
