What are we fighting for?
Why do we even bother?
We don't see eye to eye no more
This house is tearin' apart

I know love ain't fair
I know it ain't perfect
But I can't be here
'Cause your love ain't worth it

A part of me scared
A part of me searchin'

And this is how it sounds when my heart cries
You won't even come to my rescue
I'm cryin' for you, baby
This is the soundtrack to my broken heart

What are we screaming for?
Why does it even matter?
When you're walkin' out that door
And my heart is breakin' in half

I know love ain't fair
I know it ain't perfect
But I can't be here
'Cause your love ain't worth it

A part of me scared
A part of me searchin'

And this is how it sounds when my heart cries
Cries, cries
And you won't even come to my rescue
I'm cryin' for you, baby
This is the soundtrack to my broken heart

You see me drownin'
But you won't save my life
I'm dyin', baby
My best is never enough to keep you happy

So listen to the sound of my broken heart
I can't get over you, baby
And you won't even come to my rescue
This is the soundtrack to my broken heart
This is the soundtrack to my broken heart
