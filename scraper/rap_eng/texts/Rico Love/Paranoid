I see two of my bitches in the club
But they don't know about each other(they don't know 4x)
Wouldn't I be a pimp if I set them up
To have a threesome with your boy
If they not too paranoid

[Verse 1]
One of my chicks, she straight from Vallejo
She be in the 8 0
And she got a boyfriend, she got a boyfriend
But she only love him for his bankroll
She text me like:
"I wish I was with you and not with him"
I hit her back like:
"Well if you ditch that nigga, we can get it popping then"
I ain't lead her on, she came over
Already had a pretty little thing over
She said "Baby girl look good as fuck"
Both of them let me beat it up

[Verse 2]
Now I be on the Westside throwing up my set high
D1 that's my only gang
And all the bad bitches show a nigga love
The scared hoes running like they owe my change
I heard mustard on the beat and I'm fucking with a freak
Ty rolling up the weed, bitches in the backseat
And when she bust it open, baby girl you better eat
And if you don't, get to stepping like you pledging greek
You know it's Ric
Same nigga with the lights on
Dark skin nigga with the ice on
Out Vegas while the fight on
Pretty bitches blowing dice for him
Your baby momma might know him
You should be nice to him
Keep a poker face, pull it out and poke her face
Sucker nigga you should know your place
I see your hoe, meet your hoe, feed your hoe, and get your hoe replaced
Big bills never lower case
