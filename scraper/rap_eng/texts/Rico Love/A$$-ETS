Smoking on cohiba, riding with a tifa
Bitch, you hear that 808 jumpin' out the speaker?
Ya man hit a cure, well I could put a teepa
Connect car de low, I could put it cheaper
Eight for the ching, nine for the sneaker
Room full of time, ladies nice to meet ya
Whole lotta (ass), pedal pedal laces
Eight cars too much, need a little bit of space
Models in the place, love a pretty face
Pink bottles by the case, thick hollas by the waist
Fresh from Margiela, ride without the plates
Young Boy Wonder, fly without the cake
With shorties shake the-

Success down the street, victory is who we chasing
Tour around the world, this is history in the making
If she pretty then she taken, back to bag racing
Brand new Ferraris, no tint no mistaking
Do this shit for real, ya'll niggas faking
Do it for the love, ya'll niggas hating
We be on that money get them bitches what they looking for
The fiends turn into fans the clientele is who I'm cooking for
VVS is in the neck I be the best we feed the rest of east or west I'm breaking bitches town
Gotta keep it wet, get that pussy popping and I'm hopping in my bag division one up in this motherfucker
Cut them bitches fast

Bounce that (ass, ass ,ass) hope you know how to shake it, shake it, shake it
And if the pussy smell (bad, bad, bad) I know you ain't gonna taste it, taste it, taste it
I'm about to give ya that (D, D, D) I hope you can take it, take it, take it
Keep the heels in the freaky dress, shorty already naked, naked, naked
Shorty never let you down, lovers who keep me up, I turn that thing around
Promise to make a nut, a whole lotta *ass*
A nigga tryna fuck, know when the boys out, you other niggas out of luck
Nigga we don't give a shit-a
