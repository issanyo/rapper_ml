Bro, you fucked a lot of nigga's girls (A lot of them)
And my nigga, you fucked a lot of nigga's girls (Fucked a lot of niggas girls)
I'm talkin' 'bout, late nights (Wow), flights (Shh)
Shoppin' spree, all over the world, you fucked a lot of nigga's girls
You wrote songs about it
You made millions of dollars talkin' about it (Oh no)
Bro, you fucked a lot of nigga's girls (You fucked a lot of niggas girls man)
You understand that?
I'm talkin' 'bout, the most beautiful girls (Yeah?)
I'm talkin' 'bout, some was just average
Some wasn't even on your level, you was just doin' it (Why?)
Bro, you fucked a lot of nigga's girls
Wow, hol' up
What happens if somebody fucks yours?
Even kings die
