[Verse 1]
You won't believe it
What I'm gonna do to your body tonight
If I told you
I just hope you're ready baby
I just hope you're ready for the ride
You gon have the time of your life babe
Oh oh
I'ma do you right girl
All night girl we can go, go
Right now

[Hook]
Go with the flow tonight baby
Go with the flow
Even if it means that you won't need your clothes tonight baby
Go with the flow
Just because you ain't no good girl
Baby that don't mean that you a ho
Especially if it's on the low
Go with the flow tonight baby
Go with the flow
And it just might feel good
You never know

[Verse 2]
I don't see nothing but grown people
I don't see nothing but grown people
And if them hoes is judging you
Then maybe you with the wrong people
Vegas nights, Miami mornings
New York shopping, LA performance
My dick so good, it fits so good
You'll forget any nigga that you had before it
Fuck that shit, why miss out?
Take them shots, pull tits out
Kiss your homegirl in the mouth
And if she tripping put that bitch out
Got a big house, lotta rooms, pick one
I know you wanna get done
You met a lotta niggas in the club tonight
But you end up leaving with a rich one
With my own job, no Tommy
But tonight I ain't got no Bonnie
I checked that box Barack
But I had enough bread to vote Romney
It's early enough for breakfast
But it's late enough to stay low
So come up out them clothes, fo sho, and go

[Hook]
