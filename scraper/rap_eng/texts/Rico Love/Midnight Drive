Brooklyn yeah
Turn the lights down

Uh need it in my life now
And when I say now I mean right now
Supa dupa clean need a wipe down
Caught me for a second
Now he tryin' make a wife now
Hype now workin' with them cameras
Fly chick Lois bag Louis bandanas
Got 'em goin' crazy 'cause the sex is bananas
He just wanna spoil me to watch me have a tantrum
Home girls love me and we be ridin' phantoms
Mad chicks hate me cause I be writin' anthems
Plus you know I'm loaded just signed an expansion
Yeah I'm goin' cause the dark nigga's handsome

When he calls me
When he calls me and says come over
I'm there to give him all of me
If I'm twisted, if I'm sober
Oh Yeah
Because his kisses
Seem to start a chain reaction
You gotta see it to believe it
You gotta feel
And when you feel you know it's real
It's something different
Something crazy happens
Oh oh oh
I come running when I hear my phone ring

And that's the only reason I'll be makin' this drive a midnight
(Tryna get to my baby)
Hang up, my clothes and I'm leavin'
I'll be makin' this drive a midnight drive
(Gotta get to my baby, yeah)

When he tells me, when he tells me that he needs me
I'm there
We can fight
All of the nights
He held me
I love the way
He kisses me deeply
Oh yeah
Because his kisses
Seem to start a chain reaction
You gotta say it to believe it
You gotta feel
And when you feel you know it's real
It's something different
Something crazy happens
Oh oh oh
I come running when I hear my phone ring

And that's the only reason I'll be makin' this drive a midnight
(Tryna get to my baby)
Hang up, my clothes and I'm leavin'
I'll be makin' this drive a midnight drive
(Gotta get to my baby, yeah)

And I can't wait to be inside your arms
I don't care how long it's gon' take, boy, yeah
Oh I'm off this midnight drive
I'm rushing to get there and it's so worth it
Because his kisses
Seem to start a chain reaction
You gotta see it to believe it
And when you feel it
You know you feel something real
It's something different
Something crazy happens
I'll come coming when I hear my phone ring
And that's the only reason I'll be makin' this drive at midnight
(Tryna get to my baby)
Pack up my clothes and I'm leavin'
I'll be makin' this drive a midnight drive
(Gotta get to my baby, yeah)
