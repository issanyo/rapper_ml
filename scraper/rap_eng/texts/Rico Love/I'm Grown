[Bow Wow:]
Darkchild
Ye,s yelling to the lite beat and
It's B-dub and Tiffany
And we are in the place to be and
We came in to move your feet and
Get things jumping like they supposed to

Teen magazines
We're jumping right out the posters
Can't believe what you seeing
Then look closer
I know you can't believe she getting older

[Tiffany Evans:]
She's just a teen
So how could she eally know what she wants
I can't believe
You'd think I'd run and tell you're mean to me
When it's really like she mean ain't she

I know just what you think
You're so stuck in the past like stone-washed jeans
And I can endorse anything through me
I'm flyer then you'd ever thought I'd be

[Bridge:]
You wonder why I'm so cold
You coulda been more involved, but no
I'm not the girl that you knew before
I can't believe you didn't know that I'm grown

[Chorus:]
I'm grown now
Certified and all that
You say want you want
You can't take a thing from me
I'm grown now (oh)
I... I... I... I'm grown now (I'm grown)

I'm grown now
Got my own money
You ain't gonna run me
I ain't no dummy
I'm grown now (yea...)
I... I... I... I'm grown now (I'm grown)

[Tiffany Evans:]
I can't believe
They tryna block me
But you're still playing them games
I thought you'd be
Up in my lead
But no, you can't compete
Back up, don't touch
Gotta give me 50 feet

Cause I'm on another level
I'm bringing things to life like I'm Gepetto
This is the last time that I'm gonna tell you
I'm doing it big now
You want a piece
Let it go

[Repeat Bridge:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bow Wow:]
Aye, Tiff
Yo big brother got you
It's nothing

You push one hand to the cloud
Then back to the wind
Bow and Tiff Evans is back at it again
Yeah, ma
You grown
Go on and let you rims spin, yeah

You got ya lil premieres
These 50 lil days go on
And let you paint drip (drip drip drip)
Tell your parents don't trip
And with ya girls
Go on ya 'lil trips

It's your world, lil mama
It's your life to live
Believe that

[Tiffany Evans:]
I'm not those girls you're used to dating
I got a unique situation
(I'll tell you the truth)
You can travel the world
But you'll never find someone
(That does what I do)
I'll have you open cause...

[Repeat Chorus:]

I... I... I... I'm grown now
