[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with the DJ
I do whatever he tells me
So tell me that ain't love
Hey, I'm in love with the DJ
I'm speedin' out on the freeway
He's the only one who can help me
So point me to the club
Hey, I'm in love with the DJ

[Verse 1]
I went from zero to sixty in like two point five
So you know I can't wait to get inside
I hear the base line knockin'
And everybody's out on the floor
I sashay in my stilettos, the bright red pair
Plus it took me two hours just to do my hair
I see my girls at the table with like three more bottles to go
Not to mention I'm in love with the DJ...

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with the DJ
I do whatever he tells me
So tell me that ain't love
Hey, I'm in love with the DJ
I'm speedin' out on the freeway
He's the only one who can help me
So point me to the club
Hey, I'm in love with the DJ

[Verse 2]
He hopped on the turn tables just to play my jam
He dropped the beat and I put up my hands
I see a lot of girls dancin' but I know he played that record for me
(Hey DJ, play the record for me)
I got all the boys jockin' but I need my space
It turns me on when he turns up that base
I'm in the middle of the club, I don't care about the V.I.P
Because I'm in love with the DJ...

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with the DJ
I do whatever he tells me
So tell me that ain't love
Hey, I'm in love with the DJ
I'm speedin' out on the freeway
He's the only one who can help me
So point me to the club
Hey, I'm in love with the DJ

[Bridge]
She don't want to leave the party
She's with the DJ
And you can't get her off the floor
(Hey, I'm in love with the DJ)
She don't want to leave the party
She's with the DJ
And you can't get her off the floor
(Hey, I'm in love with the DJ)

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with the DJ (I think I might be in love)
I do whatever he tells me (whatever, whenever, however)
So tell me that ain't love (you can't tell me that ain't love)
Hey, I'm in love with the DJ...
