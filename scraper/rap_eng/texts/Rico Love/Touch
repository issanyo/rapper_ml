[Verse 1]
Trust me
I'd be so good for you, baby
(Oh no no)
Love me, hate me
Either way we'll go crazy
Go crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
In the bedroom babe
Cause anyone could...you, babe
But that ain't all I'm into
I wanna get inside your brain
Every part of you

[Chorus ]
I go from touchin' you with both hands
To touchin' you with no hands
T-t-touchin' you
That's my favorite way of touchin' you
(Favorite way)

[Verse 2]
No words spoken
I still speak your language
I swear I do
Let the story
In between those pages
Those pages

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna share it with you
Cause any one could...you, babe
But that ain't all I'm into
I wanna get inside your brain
Every part of you

[Chorus]
I go from touchin' you with both hands, babe
To touchin' you with no hands
(No hands, no hands)
T-t-touchin' you
That's my favorite way of touchin' you
My favorite way

[Chorus]
I go from touchin' you with both hands
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
To touchin' you with no hands, no hands
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
T-t-touchin' you
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
That's my favorite way of touchin' you
I'm touchin' you, babe
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)

[Bridge]
Cause anyone could...you, baby
But that ain't all I'm into, love, no no
I wanna get inside your brain, oh
Oh no
And every part of you

[Chorus ]
I go from touchin' you with both hands
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
To touchin' you with no hands, no hands, no hands
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
T-t-touchin' you, touchin' you
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
That's my favorite way of touchin' you
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
My favorite way of touchin' you, touchin' you, touchin' you
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
My favorite way of touchin' you baby, touchin' you, touchin' you
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
