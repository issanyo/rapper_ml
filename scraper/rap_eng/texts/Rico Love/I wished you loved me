[Intro:]
Uhh uhh uh uh uo woah woah uh uh uh uh ou whoa whoa..

[Verse 1:]
Something, Something Is Simple As Me Hearing Your Name
Puts Me, Puts Me In A Place That I Can't Even Explain
I Really Didn't Know Back Then But Right Now Im Totally Sure
Baby I Know Im Your Friend But I Wanna Be Much More

I Get Butterflies When I See You Coming
Oh Boy You Got Me Running
This Feeling In My Stomach Tells Me I Should Be Your Woman
Cause You're The Only One Who Makes My Fairy Tale Come True

[Chorus:]
How Can Someone Make Me So Sad But Still I Only Want Them To Stay
I Wanna Say I Love You So Bad, But I Dont Wanna Scare You Away
Please I Wish That You'll Understand
That I Wanna Be More Than Just Your Friend
I Wish You Loved Me

[Verse 2:]
I See, I See You Talking To Them Girls On The Phone
I Wish That I Can Tell Them All To Leave You Alone
Really Didn't Know Back Then But Right Now Im Totally Sure
That I Wanna Be Much More

This Is Why I Never Really Like Your Girlfriends
Why I Never Really Gave Them A Chance
Because I Realized That Im Your Woman

[Chorus:]
How Can Someone Make Me So Sad But Still I Only Want Them To Stay
I Wanna Say I Love You So Bad, But I Dont Wanna Scare You Away
Please I Wish That You'll Understand
That I Wanna Be More Than Just Your Friend
I Wish You Loved Me

[Bridge:]
Said If You Really Love Somebody,
I Mean Really Really Really Really Love Somebody
Let Me Hear You Say Yeahh, Let Me Hear You Say Yeahh Yeahh
If You Really Know You Need Them
And You Know Deep Down Youre Never Gonna Leave 'Em
Let Me Hear You Say Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Hear You Say Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

[Chorus:]
How Can Someone Make Me So Sad But Still I Only Want Them To Stay
I Wanna Say I Love You So Bad, But I Dont Wanna Scare You Away
Please I Wish That You'll Understand
That I Wanna Be More Than Just Your Friend
I Wish You Loved Me [x3]
