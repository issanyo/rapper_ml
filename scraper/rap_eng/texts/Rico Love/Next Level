[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
I said baby girl, lighting up the room like the light's up
You excite a nigga 'til you got me feeling niced up
Everything about it feels amazing, spiced up
Hot and steamy like my mother cooked a little rice up
See that 20 karats, please get it priced up
I'm past that girlfriend shit baby, wifed up
Elevated feeling like we going a couple flights up
Next level, with a hope you ain't afraid of heights
What?
Skyscrapers take it higher
Even got a helicopter on the roof waiting for a small fire
And add flame to the spark
And let us ride up to heavens to the next level, let me do my part

[Verse 2]
[Mary J. Blige:]
It feels like your hands were designed to be on my body
[Busta Rhymes:]
You best believe that, and I agree with you too
[Mary J. Blige:]
Like I was made to be your girl
[Busta Rhymes:]
Yeah, and you already know
[Mary J. Blige]
That's why I won't give my time to just anybody
[Busta Rhymes:]
You know I'm with you, baby
[Mary J. Blige:]
Cause my time's your time, my world's your world

[Pre-Chorus:]
So if it's cool with you
I'm a tell my girls go out tonight, without me
Got thing's to do with you
Let's bring the party to the house tonight
Cause tonight I'm ready, yeah

[Hook]
I'd rather play with my baby
I think it's time that me and him go to the next level
Uh, I'm gon' love him like crazy
I hope he's ready cause we gonna go to the next level

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Baby ain't nothing left to do but rock on
Want a G5 to the next level, hop on
[Mary J. Blige:]
Let's go to the next level
[Busta Rhymes:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright
I love it when we're in the bed and we cuddle
Or you riding out with me like we on a space shuttle
[Mary J. Blige:]
Let's go (yeah) to the next level
[Busta Rhymes:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]
[Mary J. Blige:]
And I'm OK as long as I got your arms around me
[Busta Rhymes:]
You know I love when I got my arms around you too
[Mary J. Blige:]
I feel free to loose control
[Busta Rhymes:]
Let it go baby
[Mary J. Blige:]
And I was lost in love, so glad that you found me
Cause your love's too good, too just, let go

[Pre-Chorus]
[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes:]
Baby ain't nothing left for you to do but rock on
Want a G5 to the next level, hop on
[Mary J. Blige:]
Let's go (yeah) to the next level
[Busta Rhymes:]
I love the way you really take my love muscle
And you ride it out with me like we on a space shuttle
[Mary J. Blige:]
Let's go (yeah) to the next level

[Verse 5]
Everybody get to putting up your lighter now
Baby girl you see me shining much brighter now, yeah
Fulfilling all of your desires now
Give me a hug, open your arms a little wider now
Damn, you see the feeling we creating
Bottles up, let's make a toast and do a lot of celebrating
[Mary J. Blige:]
Let's go to the next level

[Hook]

I think it's time that we go on
Baby come on, let's go
To the next level

[Busta Rhymes:]
I love it when we're in the bed and we cuddle
Or you riding out with me like we on a space shuttle
[Mary J. Blige:]
Let's go, to the next level
