[Intro: Rico Love]
Turn the lights on
Love life, live free, oh yeah, yeah
Love life, live free, oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
I think today'll be another wonderful day
If you tryin' gettin' crackin' homie let me know
I got some Hennessy and Gin, I'm smokin' again
If you got that sticky, nigga, let me smoke
As I hold the smoke I choke on the dope
We got no destination, we just rollin'
I'm so not focused, I'm so wide opened on my perfect
I'm tryin' to do to sucka shake up make 'em hate me ever mo'
So what, today I'm really feelin' like I'm the greatest and can't another nigga fade me
Just ridin', ridin', ridin', ridin'
Stay high, get high, so high

[Hook: Rico Love]
Love life, live free, oh yeah. yeah
(Love life, live free, oh yeah)
Drink good, smoke good, oh yeah, yeah
(Love life, live free, oh yeah)
Enjoy everything, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
You only get one life so hold on and don't let go
Love life, live free, oh yeah. yeah
Love life, live free, oh yeah. yeah

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
I'm in the ... (?) good money and my plan good .... (?)
With a handgun left me with no answers
You can call it and-one, I'mma call it mid-one
When the Po-Po killed 'em it was something I can't stand us
I mind they manners, it's puff and then we pass
We get the Road Warriors to put it to work to get the sky
Smoke weed, fuck cancer, no need to take a chance
That tobacco it ain't natural plus it shortens up your span
Love your life, never stress out on that bullshit just do it right
Do your thing, make sure that your money tight
Care-free, ............ (?), I don't give a (I don't give a)
Livin' life, ditchin' haters, I don't (I don't)
Bone Thugs-N-Harmony the realest, you could feel us
Rip Eazy this for you, I can't forget you, you my nigga
Said it with love because I meant it
We get the thugs, and we get our vest , if it is the plug, then ....  (?) mother fuckin'............(?)

(Love life, live free, oh yeah)
Enjoy everything, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
You only get one life so hold on and don't let go
Love life, live free, oh yeah. yeah
