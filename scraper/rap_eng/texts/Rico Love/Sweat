[Intro: Rico Love (Usher)]
Watch this!
Uh, yeah, J-Lack Tracks, man!
(U.S.!)
Sure real good right here, man!
Take it to the Westside!
It's gettin' hot in here, baby girl, let me sit you down, you need to cool off!
Ri-co Love, go!

[Verse 1: Rico Love]
Let me sit you down
And show you how to act when a bunch of real niggas 'round, get it now?
Not to mention how my mouthpiece turn a freak out, baby
I can burn a kitchen down!
No [?] 'round *vous,* baby
Me and you, baby, I'll show you how to lift the ground!
Let me see you in your pretty Vickies, switch around
Come and get you every time a nigga hit your town!
Party in the Palms, Bacardi make you calm
But I can bang your body like a drum!
And I know I've got baguettes on my neck
But damn all that, baby, I'm just tryin' to see if I can make you sweat!

[Hook: Usher]
I can make you sweat
Can you feel the heat?  Girl, I won't stop 'til you sweat
Baby, take it off, come get next to me, sweat
Let me turn it up, girl, I won't stop 'til you sweat
Bet I can get you wet with your clothes on!

[Verse 2: Rico Love]
Take a load off, let your hair down
Take your clothes off, baby, you can stay a while!
And your presence is a present, so why's you stressin'
When you can unwrap a little piece of heaven?
I'm tryin' to have you sweatin', hop out the 6
Walk up the steps and unbutton your Sevens!
I know your hair is done
But, baby, my bedroom's like a marathon!
You ain't dealin' with a square, I'm bangin' out your back and
Callin' you a (ho) while I'm pullin' on your hair
Yeah, I'm workin' with the fire like a chef
When I'm done, you'll be runnin' to your friends when I make you sweat!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Usher]
Look what you did now, club's about to close up
And you done wet your clothes up, girl!
We need to shake the breeze 'cause I don't want to see you out here in the cold
Girl, and everybody lookin' at those, baby [?]
Now, we could be lovers and friends
Head back to my crib!
Get freshed up so I can get you back where I came, girl!

[Hook]

[Outro: Usher (Rico Love)]
This is a J-Lack track, man!
Rico!
(What up, Ush, you good?)
I already got one with me, pimpin'!
That's yours right there, baby!
(I need both of those, dude!
Bet I can get you wet with your clothes on!)
