(Yung Lan on the track)

[Hook]
Good sex, good neck, you're so wet
This song right here is about you
This song right here is about you
My bitch, my world, my queen, my girl
This song right here is about you
This song right here is about you
You loyal so I love ya and it don't take too much to spoil ya
This song right here is about you
This song right here is about you
Would you ride? Would you ride? By my side? By my side?
This song right here is about you
This song right here is about you

[Verse 1: Skippa Da Flippa]
Cater to ya, show you I love ya
Honestly I can't put no bitch above ya
Just hold me down, that's what a young nigga need
Grab your ass, squeeze you tight every time I hug ya
Often we go through problems
Fuck up the mall and made back what it costed
I made myself a boss surrounded by bosses
Real player don't count the wins, they count the losses
If you pray together, you'll stay together
We argue a lot but I know it'll get better
I know one thing, that you're my bitch, that's forever
Go a little deeper so you'll get a little wetter
I done seen you in some of my dreams
Let me see you inside of the jeans
You are for me, you are only for me
When I love I love to the extreme
Take you down stairs to undress ya
You sneeze, I bless ya
Flippa so extra
Then I reach on the dresser
Puttin' on the soul section
Do you get the message?
Look I know you a blessin'
Show you love and affection
If you down to ride
If you keep it real then I think I'm your guy

[Hook]
Good sex, good neck, you're so wet
This song right here is about you
This song right here is about you
My bitch, my world, my queen, my girl
This song right here is about you
This song right here is about you
You loyal so I love ya and it don't take too much to spoil ya
This song right here is about you
This song right here is about you
Would you ride? Would you ride? By my side? By my side?
This song right here is about you
This song right here is about you

[Verse 2: Rico Love]
Love to see your effort girl but ain't no pressure
Just wanna undress ya girl but never stress
All night I just imagine
I can you love for passion
Yeah my cabana was full
I ain't even know half the hoes that was in that bitch
(?) bombs like the seltzer water
Thought the shit was (?) when I spend that shit
I was in your ear though
Lips up on your ear lobe
You was feelin' it
DJ Nando was spinnin' (RIP)
And you know he was killin' it
Top off the drop
Got home and popped off your top
Lips locked on that pretty pussy until you hopped on my cock
Meet, Rico Love, told her no bitches please
You gave my dick a squeeze
The rest is history
Turn the lights on

[Hook]
Good sex, good neck, you're so wet
This song right here is about you
This song right here is about you
My bitch, my world, my queen, my girl
This song right here is about you
This song right here is about you
You loyal so I love ya and it don't take too much to spoil ya
This song right here is about you
This song right here is about you
Would you ride? Would you ride? By my side? By my side?
This song right here is about you
This song right here is about you
