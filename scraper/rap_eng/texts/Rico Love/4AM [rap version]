Sitting Here Feeling Kinda Crazy
But Not Just Any Crazy
It's The kind You Feel When You Love Somebody
And I Know That My Baby
Is Calling Somebody Else Baby
And I Can't Sit Still
Look How Gone It Got Me
Who Knew That My Heart Could Ever Bruise
You See This Scar Here On My Chest
I'm Hurting And He Don't Even Care

It's 4 AM And My Lover Won't Answer
He's Probably Somewhere With a Dancer
Sippin' Champagne While I'm In His Bed
It's 4 AM And I Think I Might Lose It
This Motherfucker Thinking I'm Stupid
He Must Have Bumped His Head
I Only Know It's 4 AM

(Sean Paul)
Rbam Bam Bam Girl
First Things First Girl
Why You Gotta Think The Worst Girl?
It's Like a Curse My Heart It Hurts
Wit You And These Requesting
You Questioning In My Every Move
Wanna know Everything I Do
You Know You Are My Only Put
To You Only Girl I Stay True
Callin Me Friends Dem Late At Night
Waking Dem Up Girl Dat's No Right
These Likkle Things Gwan Make Us Fight
Never Happend Before Girl I Don't Know Why
You Insist To Act So Insane
Consistantly Make Me Feel Pain
Drainin My Brain Emotions All Strain
Can't Maintain Outta Road I'm Stayin
All When She Bawlin Still Me She Callin
Still Remember Those When We would Blaze
In Love She Fallin
When You Met Me Baby I Was a Player I Was Ballin
Change Around In My Life
For You Baby Because You My Darling

It's 4 AM And My Lover Won't Answer
He's Probably Somewhere With a Dancer
Sippin' Champagne While I'm In His Bed
It's 4 AM And I Think I Might Lose It
This Motherfucker Thinking I'm Stupid
He Must Have Bumped His Head
I Only Know It's 4 AM

Standing here and I'm getting heated
Pour me up a drink I swear I need it
I think I'ma about
About to hurt somebody
Swear this man is begging me to leave him
Getting sick of being so mistreated
Another night without
Without his arms around me
Who knew that my heart could ever bruise
You see this scar here on my chest
I'm hurting and he don't even care

It's 4 AM And My Lover Won't Answer
He's Probably Somewhere With a Dancer
Sippin' Champagne While I'm In His Bed
It's 4 AM And I Think I Might Lose It
This Motherfucker Thinking I'm Stupid
He Must Have Bumped His Head
I Only Know It's 4 AM
