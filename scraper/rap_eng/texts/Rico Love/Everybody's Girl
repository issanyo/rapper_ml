Verse 1
You should of knew it from the jump she a jump
Every time a nigga pop a bottle she a jump
You should see her face when she see a nigga stunt
She be looking at his car like, “this the one I want”
And she know, you can’t afford that shit
She a bad baby but you should abort that bitch
Me and my niggas world toured that bitch
No Benzes, we Honda Accord that bitch
So you look real dumb, you know that
You know your income?, she gonna blow that
Where your ho at? Where your ho at?
Looking like the front page of Worldstar in my Kodak
But it’s not your fault, nobody schooled you
You was new in town, the bitch fooled you
A have you fucked up if you let her
But you know now, so do better

Pre-Chorus:
Holler at me, I can tell you what it's hitting foe
Everybody in the club got her info
She a freak, she a whop, she a nimpho
So make sure you don’t get sentimental

Chorus:
Yeah, you love her
But she loves everyone, everyone
That’s everybody’s girl
And each time that you lay down and touch her
Just know you ain’t the only one
Oh no that's not cha girl
That’s everybody’s girl
Turn the lights on

Verse 2
Michelle and Chante!
Them two make one hell of an entre
One of them is married the other one gone stray
So how you gone treat them hoes like prom dates?
They pose in ya'll face, they pose with bum face
Always name dropping
Like, "you know we know Lebron James?"
I’m like so bitch, Who else you know, bitch?
With them old bags, is them Coachs?
Taking pics in another nigga Phantom
Out in Vegas with a couple other randoms
Molly Heads got a pill popping anthem
And them real bad bitches can’t stand them
Can you blame 'em?, You can’t tame 'em
You with strangers, I wouldn’t even change 'em
I’m just happy that I told my crew
Cause we all need hoes like you

Pre-Chorus:
Holler at me, I can tell you what it's hitting foe
Everybody in the club got her info
She a freak, she a whop, she a nimpho
So make sure you don’t get sentimental

Chorus:
Yeah, you love her
But she loves everyone, everyone
That’s everybody’s girl
And each time that you lay down and touch her
Just know you ain’t the only one
Oh no that's not cha girl
That’s everybody’s girl

Bridge
How you in the lab with the jump off showing her the biz?
Not even knowing you can trizz
Ya'll be courtside at the lake show
And I bet she know who all them niggas is
Saying that’s her bro or her bestie
Bitch probably' fucked half of the Espys
And I bet she got two phones
You be like, “do you smile like that when you text me?”
Head super cold, unemployed
But always be at all-star week and the super-bowls
Super throwed, she living large
Stay in the newest clothes, always in a different car
I can never be mad at her grind
Do your thing love, go head shine
But if you'll kill a nigga over her
Shit, I hope you do a whole lot of time

Pre-Chorus:
Holler at me, I can tell you what is hitting foe
Everybody in the club got her info
She a freak, she a whop, she a nimpho
So make sure you don’t get sentimental

Chorus:
Yeah, you love her
But she loves everyone, everyone
That’s everybody’s girl
And each time that you lay down and touch her
Just know you ain’t the only one
Oh no that's not cha girl
That’s everybody’s girl
Turn the lights on
