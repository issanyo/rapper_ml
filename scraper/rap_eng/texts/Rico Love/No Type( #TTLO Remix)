[Hook:]

She ain’t got no type
Rich niggas is the only kind she like
Money, cars and ice
Now you know what I mean When I say bitches be like
She ain’t got no type (She ain't got no type, no type)
Call a babysitter cuz she bout to take a flight
She do it every night
Even though her momma tell
Her she ain’t livin’ right

[Verse 1:]
Said she only lives on Sundays
On the stage with Stevie J like it’s a runway
Takin’ selfies with her homegirl
Damn, baby, is you eva gon’ put down yo phone, girl?
Gone girl, how the fuck I'm gon' judge?
(Turn the lights on)
Bitch, I’m in the club too
On champagne I spent a dub
I like groupie love too
Everyday I tell my son
I be like ‘daddy loves you’
You ain’t seen yo kids for weeks
Bitch that shit don’t bug you?

[Pre-Hook:]

And you ain’t even out here gettin’ paper
Man, this shit is crazy
All that bullshit is gon’ take you
Takin’ nowhere fast
Talkin’ 0 to 100, ho
All that runnin’
Don’t even know what you runnin’ fo’?
She said

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
She in KOD on a Monday
With that dirty ass weave, girl
That shit must weigh a ton
Bae High maintenance
But you in a Hyundai
Five girls, one room
When you bitches gon’ step up yo funds, bae?
“Rico, is you mad?’ Bitch, I might be
But is you bitches gettin’ cash?
Unlikely, that means you’re unlike me
That’s why you do not excite me

[Pre-Hook + Hook:]


[Bridge:]
She be geeked up
Gee-geeked up
(Rich niggas is the only kind she like)
She be geeked up, gee-geeked up
(With that dirty ass weave, girl, that shit must weigh a ton, bae)
She be geeked up, gee-geeked up
(Damn, baby, is you eva gon’ put down yo phone, girl?)
She be geeked up, gee-geeked up
(Five girls, one room, when you bitches gon’ step up yo funds, bae?)
Before you get an attitude, I want you to ask yourself
Which part of this song is a lie?
Everything I’m saying is shit you see everyday
I’m just the one ain’t afraid to talk about it
May 19th, 2015, turn the lights on
Album comin’

[Hook]
