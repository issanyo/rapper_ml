[Z.A.Y.]
What yo moms don't know won't hurt her
I still think that her ass don't deserve ya
Pass the tape in the club
All black, rolled up
Still these hoes screaming murder
Murderrr...
600 miles in the whip
Till you tell a nigga don't trip
Well here's a tip, well I just might trip
I might just kiss some bitch
From the club that I don't even love
When I went it took a sip
But I never hit though
I just hit you when I need to spill some shit so
Leave that shit up in the past girl
Cause in the present I can see you in the crystal
My nigga think you bad for me
He don't know the whole story
What can I say
Hands over his head girl
He just looking out for me
I take it back to the Jon B
Roll the dial back up in my time piece
I've seen lightskin Lincoln's
But that dark skin makes you a dime piece
They say that Love conquers all
Love has no fear
But they don't know flip the shit
Let me whisper in your ear like

[Rico Love]
I'm the one you be textin' when you be up at your job
I'm the one that brought that Benz that's in your garage
I'm the reason you don't stress when shit gets hard
And anything you want, it's all yours
They don't know
On your birthday I'm the one who saw your birthday suit
Got that Birkin bag and bought that birthday coupe
I keep it all real, I ain't gotta tell lies to you
You're the only one who knows the truth

[Hook]
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
We'd be in the same room
We don't ever say shit
Let's keep it between me and you
And we cool (Cause they don't know)
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
You don't be talking like a lame bitch
(Jon B. Sample)
[They don't know about this here]
You follow the rules but keep it cool
Cause they don't know

[Verse 2]
We was at the same hotel, Super Bowl and All-Star week
You be acting shy but you're really an all star freak (They don't know)
That you got my name tattooed on your body
They don't know you belong to me, yeah (They don't know)
About the code names and the secret island trips
When I be up in that pussy I be callin' you my bitch
They don't know you like me, they don't know you like me
They don't even know that I share you with my wifey

[Hook w/ Z.A.Y.]
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
We'd be in the same room
We don't ever say shit
Let's keep it between me and you
And we cool (Cause they don't know)
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
You don't be talking like a lame bitch
(Jon B. Sample)
[They don't know about this here]
You follow the rules but keep it cool
