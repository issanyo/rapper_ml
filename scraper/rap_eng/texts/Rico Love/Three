[Sample: The Notorious B.I.G.]
She came twice, I came last

[Verse 1]
Don't wanna brag 'bout what I do
Or all of the ways that I please you
Won't tell my friends I put it down
I'm sure they'll figure it out after a while

[Hook]
One bottle, four hands, two bodies and three orgasms
Two for you, one for me, it's all I need
(One bottle, four hands, two bodies) Three orgasms
Numbers don't lie (Three of 'em)
(One bottle, four hands) Two for you, one for me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, hope you're impressed with all my efforts
Not a single part of you will be neglected
Applying the perfect amount of pressure
Most niggas got them lectures, whole lotta words
I don't say shit, I just play the records and I study yo' curves
Study real hard, tryna make good grades
But it ain't crazy that givin' you the D is the only way to make a straight A?
Wait for it, your body got a nigga screwed
You see the way I'm at your face? Got me showin' up at your place
I just hope that you think about me (when you masturbate)

[Hook]

[Interlude]
I don't got a bunch of rap for you, nah mean?
I don't got a whole spill, whole lotta shit to talk about
I'm just sayin' try a nigga, come through, you know where I be at
Heh, [?]
Got a bottle of whatever you want
The turn up is real, it's love
You know what I do, turn the lights on

[Hook]
