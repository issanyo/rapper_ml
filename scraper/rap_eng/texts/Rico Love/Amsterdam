[Intro]
Turn the lights on

[Chorus]
Now it all seems like a blur
All the things we saw and heard
At least for me, it was a first
Do you remember that night in Amsterdam?
Do you remember that night in Amsterdam? Ohhh
Maybe you were too gone, maybe I was gone too
And I knew I was on you, and I didn't even want to land
(Do you remember that night in Amsterdam?)
'Cause I remember clearly, yeah

[Verse 1]
So hard to describe the energy
You had to be there, you had to feel it for yourself
Walking through the static of the aromatics
Started from the bottom, made it to the attic
Hoping I don't leave up out this bitch an addict
Halfway to the plane and we still going at it (woo, damn!)
You was so sexy, cursing out taxi drivers
You were so public, you was like fuck it, let me ride it! (right here)
So I did, and you did
Had that man getting big
Wishing I could take you back to where I live
Thought about you all the way back to the crib

[Chorus]
Now it all seems like a blur
All the things we saw and heard
At least for me, it was a first
Do you remember that night in Amsterdam?
Do you remember that night in Amsterdam? Ohhh
Maybe you were too gone, maybe I was gone too
I know I was on you, and I didn't even want to land
(Do you remember that night in Amsterdam?)
'Cause I remember clearly, yeah

[Verse 2]
All those smoky rooms filled with tiny dancers
And all those voices calling my name, and I ain't tryna answer
And when you lay down on me, I couldn't help but stand
Had me all at attention, lost in this wonderland
I was so in tune, didn't notice anyone else that was in the room
Made a small shower, saw all the wall flowers
Didn't have any other choice but to bloom
Each moment run to the other, saw the beauty in every color
With me standing in the light
And you was like, "let me get a light"

[Chorus]
Now it all seems like a blur
All the things we saw and heard
At least for me, it was a first
Do you remember that night in Amsterdam?
Do you remember that night in Amsterdam? Ohhh
Maybe you were too gone, maybe I was gone too
But fuck it I was on you, and I didn't even want to land
(Do you remember that night in Amsterdam?)
'Cause I remember clearly, yeah

[Outro]
Oohhhh, do you remember, yeah?
Do you remember, I?
Do you remember, yeah?
Do you remember, I?
Oohh I, oohh I
