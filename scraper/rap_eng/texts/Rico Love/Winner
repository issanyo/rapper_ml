[Verse 1:]
I guess the stars
Were aligned when we met up
'Cause, baby I
I see the fire in your eyes
Anytime we touch
Sometimes I just wanna go run away and hide

But everytime I do
You always find a way
To come change my mind
You're my hero

[Chorus:]
I feel like a winner
When you're beside me
There ain't a thing that I can't be

I feel like a winner
You're there to guide me
Like the wind beneath my wings

I feel like a winner
Everytime I plan on giving it up
You grab my hand and look inside of me
To make me feel like a winner
Feel like a winner

[Verse 2:]
There were others
That I loved in the past
Now I know it didn't last

Because we were distant
From one another
And I don't even have to ask
If you got my back
'Cause I know the answer to that
You got me covered

Everybody else is
Just a memory from long ago
And I found love with you
Here by my side
You're my hero

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Spoken:]
When I'm with you
I feel like
I can do anything

[Bridge:]
I feel like I can fly a plane
Race a train
Travel through the galaxies
And make the stars spell out your name

I feel like I can climb
The highest mountain
And reach up into the sky

Boy, with you here
I can do anything

I would give it all
Just to feel your touch
You're the only one I need
It's like you got me starstruck

Baby boy
I'm part of
You're the other part of me

[Repeat Chorus x2:]
