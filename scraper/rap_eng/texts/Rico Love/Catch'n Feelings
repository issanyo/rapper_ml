[Chorus - TXS]
I'm catch'n feelings, I'm catch'n feelings
I'm in feelings, I'm in feelings
I'm catch'n feelings, I'm catch'n feelings
I'm in feelings, I'm in feelings
Yeah I fell in love a time or two
Something I don't have time to do, right now
(I was just fooling around with you)
Now babe I'm catch'n feelings, I'm catch'n feelings

[Turn the lights on - Rico Love]

[Verse 1 - TXS]
He be calling yeah, he be calling I answer on the first ring
And if he stop calling, I probably start bothering
And these tears might keep stop falling
No he don't gotta give me no materials
I just need his time
When he pull out them cars all them girls go crazy
I don't care as long as he mines, ah babe

[Chorus - Rico Love Lead & TXS BGV]
I'm catch'n feelings, I'm catch'n feelings
I'm in feelings, I'm in feelings
I'm catch'n feelings, I'm catch'n feelings
I'm in feelings, I'm in feelings
Yeah I fell in love a time or two
Something I don't have time to do, right now
(I was just fooling around with you)
Now babe catch'n feelings, I'm catch'n feelings

[Verse 2- Pleaure P]
Thought we was gonna be on some club shit
Never thought that it was, (never even consider love shit)
Now any time you say you going out
I wanna know your whereabouts, (whereabouts)
Don't want no nigga up your in house
And if that means that we're committed, aw girl I'm with it
I ain't gonna lie you made it easy
Aw hold me tight, don't you release me
(Girl if you can't tell I'm catch'n feelings)

[Turn the lights on - Rico Love]

[Chorus - TXS Lead & Rico Love BGV]
I'm catch'n feelings, I'm catch'n feelings
Oh I'm in feelings, I'm in feelings
I'm catch'n feelings, I'm catch'n feelings
I'm in feelings, I'm in feelings
Yeah I fell in love a time or two yeah
Something I don't have time to do, right now
(I was just fooling around with you)
Now babe I'm catch'n feelings, I'm catch'n feelings

[Verse 3 - Plies & TXS BG]
Can't go raw, I gotta hit her with the rubber
Know if I hit her with the skin I'm gonna cuff her
Ain't tryna hide my feelings I'm a lover
I ain't gonna lie I was raise not to cuff em
Something about you that's different to me
I just love how you listen to me
Love ain't never make sense to me
Till I met you, you're the shit to me
Ain't gonna lie you the truth lil mama
All I can say is thank God for the coming
You have all my feelings one hunnit
Baby you a rock you the real woman
Everything I love walked out on me
Some these folks even doubted me
I do love you differently
I gotta feel you mentally
All my life I've been scared of love
Blame these thoughts, they done scared a thug
I catch flights, not feelings girl
I need one one to teach me how to love

[Chorus - TXS Lead & Pleasure P & Rico Love BGV]
I'm catch'n feelings, I'm catch'n feelings
I'm in feelings, I'm in feelings
I'm catch'n feelings, I'm catch'n feelings
I'm in feelings, I'm in feelings
Yeah I fell in love a time or two
Something I don't have time to do, right now
(I was just fooling around with you)
Now babe I'm catch'n feelings, I'm catch'n feelings

[Refrain - TXS & Pleasure P]
Think I got the feel for ya, catch'n feelings for you baby
Think I got the feel for ya, catch'n feelings for you baby
Think I got the feel for ya, (catch'n feelings for you baby)

[Refrain - TXS & Pleasure P & TXS]
Something about you that's different to me
(catch'n feelings for you baby)
Something about you that's different to me
(catch'n feelings for you baby)
Till I met you, you're the shit to me
(catch'n feelings for you baby)
I'm catching feelings, I'm catching feelings
