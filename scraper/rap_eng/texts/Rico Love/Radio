[Verse 1]
I was wondering if I could
Take u off somewhere
Me and u alone
Doing things we probably not supposed to
I wanna get close to you
And I'll grab the both of your hand
Put them round my waist
We'll start slow dancing
While the disc jockey playing our song
I'll give it to all night long

[Chorus]
I'll let down my hair
Take off all my clothes
Up an down the stairs
Till we end up on the floor
It's just me u and the radio
Me u and the radio
If u touch me there
I might lose control
I hope u ain't scared
To let your body go
It's just me u and the radio
Me u and the radio

[Verse 2]
Just give me an instrumental
A sexy beat that makes me move
And I'm gone be on u
I hope your ready
‘Cause this feeling is strong
And u know that it turns me on

[Chorus]
I'll let down my hair
Take off all my clothes
Up an down the stairs
Till we end up on the floor
It's just me u and the radio
Me u and the radio
If u touch me there
I might lose control
I hope u ain't scared
To let your body go
It's just me u and the radio
Me u and the radio

[Bridge]
Now turn your phone off
‘Cause we in a zone now
I'm gone take my clothes off
We gone break it on down
Me u and the r a d i o
I know
That u ready for me
I'm gone jump on it
You just gotta keep it steady
And when my jam hit
I'm gone have a dam fit
I'm gone do the dam thing
I hope u can handle it
Got a couple candles lit
Couple bottles of that tron
Promise i won't do u wrong
When that d.j. play me song
It's gone be on
Gone

[Chorus]
I'll let down my hair
Take off all my clothes
Up an down the stairs
Till we end up on the floor
It's just me u and the radio
Me u and the radio
If u touch me there
I might lose control
I hope u ain't scared
To let your body go
It's just me u and the radio
Me u and the radio
