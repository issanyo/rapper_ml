[Chorus]
Can't blame you for, having your wall up
Can't blame you 'cause, that's what that taught ya
(That's the one bad thing with men with money)
Everybody wants something
They don't wanna give nothing
Probably why you can't trust them
But I just wanna love him, oh baby

[Rico Love]
Turn the lights on

[Hook]
I could be so good 2 u X8

[Verse 1]
Walk up on you in mall
Pull up on you in your car
Everybody wanna talk
Everybody wanna ball
You be 'bout that bottle life
Spending money got 'em hype
Suppose have a model wife
Ain't even the model type, yeah
Gotta be hard tryna recognize real
When everybody say to you (no)
I know you got it but that's no way to live, oh I

[Chorus]
Can't blame you for, having your wall up
Can't blame you 'cause, that's what that taught ya
(That's the one bad thing with men with money)
Everybody wants something
They don't wanna give nothing
Probably why you can't trust them
I just wanna love him, oh baby

[Hook]
I could be so good 2 u X8

[Verse 2]
See you posted at the bar
She know how to spot 'em out
She know what that money 'bout
You know what I'm talking 'bout
Got a lot bitches in pocket you don't like though
I can see the two of us together like a psychic though
I know what to say to make your mood change
I'm thinking I should be your boo thing
I'm thinking we can do things
Fuck that oil shit this a new thing, ou and I

[Chorus]
Can't blame you for, having your wall up
Can't blame you 'cause, that's what that taught ya
(That's the one bad thing with men with money)
Everybody wants something
They don't wanna give nothing
Probably why you can't trust them
I just wanna love him, oh baby

[Hook]
I could be so good 2 u X8
