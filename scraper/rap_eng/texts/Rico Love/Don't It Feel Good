[Intro]

[Chorus:]
You better not let go
Cause you ain't you even you ain't even close
Just wait till I get you out them clothes (out them clothes)
I'm a show what your body is for, I wanna know
Don't it feel good
Don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you
Hey don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you girl
Hey don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you
Hey to you
Don't it feel good

[Verse 1:]
I was trying to ride in my benz
She was posted up with her friends
I was hanging out with my partnas but I told that ass to get in
Girl let's go for a spin you know a nigga got ends
She was checking out my checking out my checking out my rims
Hey girl let's hit the hotel make a movie more like the matinee
You know do some things you know well
Thug dashing baby that's alisay
My car was all in your lane
Them thoughts were all in your brain
My hands is all in your hair
But I won't tell your man

[Chorus:]
You better not let go
Cause you ain't you even you ain't even close
Just wait till I get you out them clothes (out them clothes)
I'm a show what your body is for, I wanna know
Don't it feel good
Don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you
Hey don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you girl
Hey don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you
Hey to you
Don't it feel good

[Verse 2:]
Girl get you up out my stable
Lay you out on the table
Clear all them dishes do it like we on cable
Cut out both of them phones
Girl you need to be sippin champagne or that 'tron
Then the headboards'll be cripping
V.i.p is b-e-d or the backseat of my ride
Fog up my windows so they can't see from outside
You can call my daddy I'm a call you baby
Girl you can get at me who be fucking you lately

[Chorus:]
You better not let go
Cause you ain't you even you ain't even close
Just wait till I get you out them clothes (out them clothes)
I'm a show what your body is for, I wanna know
Don't it feel good
Don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you
Hey don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you girl
Hey don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you
Hey to you
Don't it feel good

[Verse 3:]
Yea shawty lemme see what you got
Lemme see if you sweating or lemme see if you hot
Lemme show you why I am and show you why I'm not
Shoot 'em all night long shawty you ain't need to stop
How bout I pick you up and throw you in the middle of the bed
Till you're overwhelmed kiss you from your stamche to your neck
To your back to your thigh to the middle of your wham
Keep going and going till you scream out damn
Yea baby I'm something like a nimpho
A saint louis here with more pimpflow
So so hold on like you're in for
And get lubing show what you're in for
A whole lotta banging a whole lotta lice
Like a heavyweight fight with a '86 mike
Tyson slicing and you only know biting
Biting biting

[Chorus:]
You better not let go
Cause you ain't you even you ain't even close
Just wait till I get you out them clothes (out them clothes)
I'm a show what your body is for, I wanna know
Don't it feel good
Don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you
Hey don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you girl
Hey don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you
Hey to you
Don't it feel good
Hey don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you
Don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you
Don't it feel good
Don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you
To you
Don't it feel good
Hey hey
