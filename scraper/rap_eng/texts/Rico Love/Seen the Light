[Intro: Rico Love]
Yo, uh, just feel real good right here man
It's a good look, sugar bear, it's love
Young Chris, Gucci what's up? From the streets of VA
Talk to the whole world man, ghetto America, uh, talk to 'em man

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
It's been a struggle for me, wondering why I can't get by with my life
But now I'm free and I done did some right and wrong but still I seen the light
And I done been around the sex and drugs, hustling but mama ain't raise no thug
And it took a little to see how real it could get and how this life wasn't meant for me cause I

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Seen a lot of bad things on my block, but I ain't wanna be a victim of a gunshot
I can't let nothing hold me down

[Chorus]
See all the things I heard about
See all the things I've read about, I seen the light

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
It's kinda hard for me, to stay away from all these girls and the haters they don't like
That I'm fulfilling my dream, but I'm just tryna do my thing, my nigga can't I live my life?
I got the world on my shoulders and I'm only getting older, but it's like I'm getting colder
I'm gon' make it but I can't take it sometimes

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I came a long way from my block and I'm grateful for everything I got
I didn't let nothing bring me down

[Chorus]
See all the things I heard about
See all the things I've read about, I seen the light

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Wow, huh man after all this, who woulda thought? Little boy from Tappahannock, Virginia
Y'all know what I'm saying? Would make it all the way to the top

[Verse 3: Rico Love]
Life is vivid but seen through the eyes of a righteous spirit
They try to show us the light but we don't like to hear it
Mama told me I was bright but despite her lyrics
A large heard across my sight, I had to fight to clear it
Like a runner a couple of summers, I often wondered if it
Really was winter and that's when I heard the thunder
A current was occurring, it was stirring up my hinger
But I couldn't let the shit bury a nigga under
Used to cry hoping all of this would pass
And then I learned to use my tears to water up the grass
A part of my swag but apparently I won
Cause I took my shades off and now I'm staring at the sun
I'm seeing the light, I'm seeing the light
Realising that it's me in the light
I read about it, read about it
Heard about it, now I know about it

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
I could did wrong, I seen a lot of people hustle
But I left them things alone
I almost lost my friend to the struggle
But I guess that made me strong, made me strong
I seen a whole lot of drama and it taught me how to fight, taught me how to fight
And I thank God for my mama, she showed me what was right
I coulda been in the dark, but thank God for the light
I seen the light, I seen the light

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All the things I heard about, I read about it, I read about it oh
I seen the light, I seen the light
