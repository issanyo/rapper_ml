[Verse 1: Mario:]
If the walls were watching
If they could see your face
Im sure that they'd be talking
And I'd know what they say
They'd say damn that girl is going crazy
Damn that girl she's amazing
Touching, moaning never seen you like this baby
Never seen you this way

[Chrous]
Cause she don't act the same
When the lights go down
She don't act the same
She'd be screaming out loud
She don't act the same no, no, no
That's when I thought I had her figured
Cause in the day she's a lady, but now everythings changed
She don't act the same
(If the walls we're watching x2 )

[ Verse 2: Mario ]
If your friends could see you
If they could hear your screams
Would they recongnize you?
How shocked would they be?
Ohh Damn!!

Damn that girl she's amazing
Damn that girl going crazy
Touching moaning neer seen you liekd this bay
Never seen you this way

[Hook]

[ Verse 3: Faboulous ]
Excuse me your honor I'm calling a witness
If y'all don't believe me the walls are my witness
They den seen things in the wall of the business
So the neighbors know my name they might even know you came
Over to the house late last night
Woke up wanting more of what I ate last night
I love them quiet girls
Want it but deny it girls
Them boy you crazy but fuck it we can try it girls

[Chrous]
Cause she don't act the same
Ohhh when the lights go down
She don't act the same
Ohh she'd be screaming out loud
She dont act the same no, no, no
Could've thought I had her figured out
In the day she's a lady but now everythings changed
She don't act the same

[If these walls we're watching x2]
