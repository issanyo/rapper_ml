[Verse 1: Rico Love]
I hurt you, I'll tell the truth
And in the end, I know I'll lose, yeah
All the things I put you through
They won't compare to what you could do
In a minute, I'ma lose my mind
Cause I know I really broke your heart
Told you "Sorry" 'bout a thousand times
Since we broke up 'cause it's all my fault
Oh, I'm just asking you

[Chorus: Rico Love]
Please just don't fuck none of my niggas
No, baby, please just don't fuck none of my niggas
I know that I messed up, yeah I did you wrong
I respect the fact that you'll be moving on
But, baby, please just don't fuck none of my niggas
None of my niggas

[Verse 2: Rico Love]
Got so many Keishas in my phone, I know
I'm better off leaving you alone, I know
Deep down inside, you're the one I want, I know
But you're over me, I know
All of my temptations, can't get over them
All the situations that I put you in
Even caught me flirtin' with your very best friend, I know
I deserve all the worst
You're the gift, I'm the curse
Wish I could hit reverse
I can't though, but I'm beggin' you

[Chorus: Rico Love]
But, baby, please just don't fuck none of my niggas, none of my niggas
No, baby, please just don't fuck none of my niggas
I know that I messed up, yeah I did you wrong
I respect the fact that you'll be moving on
But, baby, please just don't fuck none of my niggas
None of my niggas

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
I know you like them winners
And upscale vandal type of dinners
And seein' cameras flashin' like the Jenners
The bros is off limits, it's navy niggas out here
But they don't fit your image, and you love bein' outchea
Don't let 'em put you out there, what's a bag to a boss?
Drown you in champagne and let you crash at the loft
Bein' bitter can backfire, I'm fuckin' sisters
You take me back, now you hate her ass and keep her distant
If we tit for tat, ain't no gettin' back
I'm just gettin' head, you might get a rack
Your body count is mountin', you can't get that back
Play the game, it's full circle like a culdesac

[Chorus: Rico Love]
But, baby, please just don't fuck none of my niggas
No, baby, please just don't fuck none of my niggas
I know that I messed up, yeah I did you wrong
I respect the fact that you'll be moving on
But, baby, please just don't fuck none of my niggas
None of my niggas
