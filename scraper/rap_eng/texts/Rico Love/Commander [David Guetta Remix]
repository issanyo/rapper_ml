[Intro: David Guetta]
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland]
I feel like the DJ is my bodyguard
You see the way he keeps me safe
With the treble and that bass
I feel free enough to party hard
This dress won't go to waste
Feels like I own the place, yeah
Don't need no V.I.P to be the boss
You see the way these people stare
Watching how I fling my hair
I'm a dance floor lover
Baby there's no other
Who do it like I do it, yeah

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & David Guetta]
From here on out
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
No fear, no doubt
I'll provide the answer (I'll provide the answer)
Right now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
Now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
Right now I command you to
Dance
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
Dance, dance, dance
I'll provide the answer (I'll provide the answer)
Dance

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
Ain't no reason to celebrate
But you know we gon' have a ball
Champagne spilling' from the wall
And I'll be partying 'til hella late
But I ain't worried, not at all
I just give my driver a call, yeah
Tell him pick me up at 8 AM
No, we ain't stopping right here
We'll take the party to the crib
Let's go all night, baby
You won't find no lady
Who does it like I does it, yeah

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
From here on out
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
No fear, no doubt
I'll provide the answer (I'll provide the answer)
Right now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
Now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
Right now I command you to

[Bridge: Kelly Rowland]
The club is jam packed
So DJ where you at?
I know you got my back
So make that bass attack
Let's make these people move
You know I need some room, to
Do what I do, I'm 'bout to act a fool
Turn the lights on

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
From here on out
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
No fear, no doubt
I'll provide the answer (I'll provide the answer)
Right now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
Now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
Right now I command you to

[Outro: Kelly Rowland & David Guetta]
Dance
I'll be your commander
Dance, dance, dance, dance
I'll provide the answer (I'll provide the answer)
Dance, dance, dance




We did it in the benz feel it like it would never end
We breakin' all rules, these rules were meant to bend
I can't believe I haven't sent a couple kisses to your navel, baby lately
