[Intro: Rico Love]
Yeah
Everybody get down
Shy
Turn the lights on

[Verse 1: Junglepussy]
Rollin' with the punch, thighs thick as mud
Pussy never funky like a skunk
If your blunts be funky light 'em up
It's goin' on about a couple months
You know that I need it more than once
Don't ever repeat it more than once
Gotta beat it up until I hush (hush)
Gotta hear me out, my needs and wants
You can fill it out, my weave, my bundles
Pack me for your lunch then eat it up
You know that I keep it heated up
Fantasies are great if they tropical
Frontin' on me is what you not gon' do
Visions of my body, so optical
I go with your love if it is logical (so crazy!)

[Chorus: Rico Love]
You about to make me tear this club up
Somebody tell the DJ that I love her
(Come let that nigga know that I'm)
And I'm willin' to die 'bout this pussy, man
'Bout to change my life up like I'm Gucci Mane
Everybody get down
You about to make me tear this club up
You about to make me tear this club up
Everybody get down
You about to make me tear this club up
You about to make me tear this club up

[Verse 2: Junglepussy]
Back up, back up, back up, let me see it, let me breathe
Burnin' trees, baby, feel the breeze
Don't talk to me unless you talkin' cheese (checks, accounts)
Overseas wanna see JP, gotta pay the fee
Call me if you horny, it's alright (right, right, right)
You need me and I'm on the next flight (flight, flight, flight)
All of this for you, I keep it tight (tight, tight)
Diggin' in my mind, what you gon' find?
I'm the kinda chick you see in your dreams
I'm the kinda chick to keep the grass green
This is type of night that [?]
This shit look like it could be real thing
The type of feelings make a nigga wanna sing (oh, baby!)
They probably [?]

[Chorus: Rico Love]
You about to make me tear this club up
Somebody tell the DJ that I love her
(Come let that nigga know that I'm)
And I'm willin' to die 'bout this pussy, man
'Bout to change my life up like I'm Gucci Mane
Everybody get down
You about to make me tear this club up
You about to make me tear this club up
Everybody get down
You about to make me tear this club up
You about to make me tear this club up
