[Verse 1]
Some things are best left unspoken
Don't waste time with that talk
Just keep that back in motion
It ain't that easy for me to get off
But I can be your guilty pleasure
Just make sure to put it down, down, down
Yeah, I'm ready for whatever
But you gotta make mama proud
And every night you love for my affection
And close the leap I guarantee to turn you out
But you just point that thing in my direction
And when I'm almost there I start making that sound

[Chorus]
Can you hear me now? Am I getting closer?
Can you hear me now?
Well, if not then you're supposed to
Can you hear me now? Ah, I can hear you, baby
I can see you, baby, ah, I can hear you, baby
I can see you, baby, ah, I can hear you, baby
I can see you, baby, can you hear me now?

[Verse 2]
I'm pretty sure that you noticed
The swagger in my walk
Just pay attention and focus
Baby, you just gotta play your part
I'm thinking you can get this treasure
But you gotta dig deeper down, down, down
When nobody love you better
But you gonna make mama proud

[Chorus]
Can you hear me now? 'Cause I can hear you
Am I getting close? Getting closer
Can you hear me now?
Well, if not then you're supposed to
Can you hear me now?
Yeah, I can hear you, baby
I can see you, baby Yeah, I can hear you, baby
I can see you, baby, yeah, I can hear you, baby
I can see you, baby, yeah, I can hear you, baby
I can see you, baby
Can you hear me now?

[Instrumental breakdown]

[Chorus]
Can you hear me now? Am I getting close?
Can you hear me now?
Well, if not, then you're supposed to
Can you hear me now? Yeah, I can hear you, baby
I can see you, baby, yeah, I can hear you, baby
I can see you, baby, yeah, I can hear you, baby
I can see you, baby, yeah, I can hear you, baby
I can see you, baby, can you hear me now?
