I just wanna make music. I don't wanna be limited to a genre. I don't wanna be limited to a particular sound. I just wanna make music. And consistently make songs that I feel like people can relate to in some way, shape, form or fashion. And, to have that freedom, have that liberty to speak my mind. Musically, I feel like it's the greatest gift that we could have. And, to express out imperfections, I feel like that's the coolest thing you could do. You know? It's honest, it's pure, it's raw. Sometimes, the truth hurt. Sometimes, the things you say don't-don't, um, you know, sit well with people. Sometimes, it makes people uncomfortable, but I welcome that dialogue. I'm not afraid to talk about it. If you don't like what I'm saying then let's sit down and let's speak about it. Let's just make songs, let's make music. I don't wanna be known as no R&B singer, I don't wanna be known as a rapper. I just wanna be known as a artist. I wanna be free to express myself at any capacity. And I may not say all the right things all the time. I may contradict myself sometimes, I feel like that's a part of human nature. Um, everybody got a little bit of hypocrisy in them, but we know what's best and we know what we--our end result should be. And, in the mean time, we just livin' and we learnin'. We sit around and we judge people so much, we forget "Damn, we human." We all human. I sin.
