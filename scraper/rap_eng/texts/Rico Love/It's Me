[Verse 1]
You fell in love with who you're lookin' at
Something has changed and there's no hiding that
Sometimes I wish that I can read your mind
And see what secrets you have I can't find

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what you're doing
Or how you spend your time
I've been getting this feeling
That something just ain't right
And I hope that I'm wrong
I don't wanna be right
You won't do this to me
Not me, not me

[Chorus]
Why you asking me these questions? It's me
You know I ain't hiding nothing, it's me, it's me
You know I wear everything on my sleeve
You already know
It's me, it's me
Why you acting like a stranger? It's me
I have always been the same girl, it's me, it's me
Why is it a problem now?
It's like you just figured out
That it's me, it's me, it's me

[Verse 2]
Is there something you wanna talk about?
'Cause everything I do upsets you now
I'm starting to feel some type of way
Starting to feel like it's a game, and I don't wanna play

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what you're doing
Or how you spend your time
No, I've been getting this feeling
That something just ain't right
And I hope that I'm wrong (I hope)
I don't wanna be right
You won't do this to me
Not me, not me

[Chorus]
Why you asking me these questions? It's me
Oh, you know I ain't hiding nothing it's me, it's me
You know I wear everything on my sleeve
Everything, everything
You already know (you, you, you already know)
It's me, it's me
Why you acting like a stranger? It's me
(Why you acting like a stranger, yeah)
I have always been the same girl it's me, it's me (I never had a representative)
Why is it a problem now? (why?)
It's like you just figured out
It's me, it's me, it's me (yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
I don't really understand
Is this really happening?
Am I crazy?
No, it ain't me
You're the one that's losin' it
Why you lookin' at me so different
Thought I used to be your best friend
Never on the outside looking in

[Chorus]
Why you asking me theses questions? It's me (why, why, oh why)
You know I ain't hiding nothing it's me it's me (you know I ain't hiding nothing, babe)
You know I wear everything on my sleeve (everything)
You already know me
It's me, it's me (you already know)
Why you acting like a stranger? It's me (Why you acting like a stranger, babe)
I have always been the same girl it's me, it's me (I have always been just plain old me)
Why is it a problem now
It's like you just figured out
It's me, it's me, it's me
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
