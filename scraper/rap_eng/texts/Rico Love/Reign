Reign, reign, reign
Nothing came the falls
But you can now conquers all, (reign)

Reign, reign, reign
Breaking down these walls
Cause it's time to conquer all
(They came to you, the reign)
And then he said

I'll reign the truth if you want me to
I'll reign the truth if you want me to (And then he said...)
I'll reign the truth if you want me to
I'll reign the truth if you want me to

And then my reign is coming down
And then my reign is coming down
And then my reign is coming down
And then my reign is coming down
