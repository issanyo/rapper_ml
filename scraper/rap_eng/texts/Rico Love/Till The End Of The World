Will you be my lover
For sake and all others?
Will you be my, my man?
And I will be your girl
Even 'til the end of the world
Let's go

Even 'til the end of the world
Even 'til the end of the world
Turn the lights up

What if I lived in a mountain
Surrounded by nothing but snow
My only desire is that you be my fire
The light of my life and to keep me warm
Let's go

Baby, if I hopped on a plane
And told the pilot, take me away
I wonder would you still remain, oh
Would you stay with me?

Oh, even 'til the end of the world
Oh, would you still want me to be your girl?
Oh, would you be my lover, forgetting all others?
Even 'til the end of the world

Even 'til the end of the world
Even 'til the end of the world
Let's go

What if they put me in prison
For reason that you'd never know
Would you stand beside me and call me your wifey?
Would you love me forever or would you go?

Baby, if I hopped on a plane
And told the pilot, take me away
I wonder would you still remain, oh
Would you stay with me?

Oh, even 'til the end of the world
Oh, would you still want me to be your girl?
Oh, would you be my lover, forgetting all others?
Even 'til the end of the world

Oh, even 'til the end of the world
Oh, would you still want me to be your girl?
Oh, would you be my lover, forgetting all others?
Even 'til the end of the world

Until the end of time, forever be my lover
Our hearts will intertwine
And could you be my baby?
Protect me from the storm
And I'll love you forever
Just hold me in your arms, arms, arms

Oh, even 'til the end of the world
Oh, would you still want me to be your girl?
Oh, would you be my lover, forgetting all others?
Even 'til the end of the world
