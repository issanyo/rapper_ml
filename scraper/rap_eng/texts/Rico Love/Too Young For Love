[Verse 1]
Her mom says she don't want him
Calling the house phone no more
Her dad told her that she should find her some new friends
Stop always thinkin' about boys

[Pre-Chorus]
But how can they possibly make her decisions
It breaks her heart inside
16 years old going through these transitions
They don't care about how hard she cries

[Chorus]
He's just a boy, she's just a girl
Alone in this world
They're not too young for love
They'll run away together
So they won't have to answer to anyone
Who says they're too young for love

[Verse 2]
Got a scholarship
But he don't wanna go straight to college
Cause she's just a junior and he's scared to leave her
Her parents are making it worse

[Pre-Chorus]
But how can they possibly make his decisions
It breaks his heart inside
18 years old and he's in this condition
They don't care about losing his fight

[Chorus]
He's just a boy, she's just a girl
Alone in this world
They're not too young for love
They'll run away together
So they won't have to answer to anyone
Who says they're too young for love

[Chorus]
Too young for love
So all alone
But they think they're not too young for love
They'll run away together
So they won't have to answer to anyone
Who says they're too young for love

[Bridge]
How can two people hide
What they're feelin' inside
Can't give, give it up on their heart
Can't let them break us apart
Just because
They think that we're too young

[Chorus]
He's just a boy, she's just a girl
Alone in this world
They're not too young for love
They'll run away together
So they won't have to answer to anyone
Who says they're too young for love

[Chorus]
Too young for love
So all alone
But they think they're not too young for love
They'll run away together
So they won't have to answer to anyone
Who says they're too young for love

[Chorus]
He's just a boy, she's just a girl
Alone in this world
They're not too young for love
They'll run away together
So they won't have to answer to anyone

[Chorus]
Too young for love
So all alone
But they think they're not too young for love
They'll run away together
So they won't have to answer to anyone
