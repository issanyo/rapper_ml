[Chorus]
Did you tell your boyfriend that we broke up? (Broke up)
Did he even know we were in love? (Love)
Did you tell your boyfriend that we broke up? (Oh did you girl?)
(Did you have it in you girl?)
And did you tell him that you probably still gon' let me fuck
Did you tell your boyfriend that we broke up? (Broke up)

[Verse 1]
You'll be flippin' it all
We be fightin', got me tusslin' all over the floor
I won't hit you even though you disrespected my own
Got a whole fuckin' family, and this what you on
I wonder does he even know, girl, that you met
That it had nothing to do with him
And I could be in the same shoes as him
There'll be someone who chooses to pretend

[Chorus]
Oh, did you tell your boyfriend that we broke up? (Broke up)
Did he even know we were in love? (Love)
Did you tell your boyfriend that we broke up? (Oh did you girl?)
(Did you have it in you girl?)
And did you tell him that you probably still gon' let me fuck
Did you tell your boyfriend that we broke up? (Broke up)

[Verse 2]
Showed up to the club knowin' I'd be there
Wore a red dress and did up your hair
Made a fuckin' scene, fingers in the air
You gon' get caught up, I don't think you care
But your lips amazing, your hips amazing
You look so good when you ride
Soakin' all up your ship girl, you be up in your bay
But you won't lose your side thing, you don't know what you hide
But before you go, there's one thing I'll ask

[Chorus]
Did you tell your boyfriend that we broke up, yeah?
Did he even know we were in love? (Love)
Did you tell your boyfriend that we broke up? (Oh did you girl?)
(Did you have it in you girl?)
And did you tell him that you probably still gon' let me fuck
Did you tell your boyfriend that we broke up? (Broke up)
