Yeah, yeah, yeah

Tell me if it's a crime, maybe I'm wrong
I'm out of my mind, when I see what I want
Come and get it, I'm grown
Don't forget it and I don't mind showing him
I'm so wide open tonight

Baby, tonight we can spend some quality time
You'll tell me secrets, baby, I'll tell you mine
You can rest your feet and unwind
For a minute, be mine, for a minute

You're so invited to the party
I will cater to you
Make you feel like a man
I can, so come on

If you give me your sight, I'll make a move
'Cos I handle just fine, I wanna see what I want, boy
Come and get it, I'm grown, don't forget it
I'll put it all on the table, I'm willing and able tonight

Baby, tonight we can spend some quality time
You'll tell me secrets, baby, I'll tell you mine
You can rest your feet and unwind
For a minute, be mine, for a minute

You're so invited to the party
I will cater to you
Make you feel like a man
I can, come on

I'll do anything I'm not supposed to
And I just hope you're ready
When I approach you, here's your invitation

You're so invited to the party
I will cater to you
Make you feel like a man
I can, come on

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You're so invited to the party
I will cater to you
Make you feel like a man
I can, come on

You're so invited to the party
I will cater to you
Make you feel like a man
I can, come on
