Turn the lights on

[Sample]
Action!

[Intro/Chorus]
Used to be mine, now it's just hi goodbye
Without a sign, you give me hi goodbye
All you do is wave when you see me
How did it get that way
Hi, hi goodbye

[Verse 1]
Oh, oh we're so cordial
Oh, oh this ain't normal
My friends even notice
'Cause you were my mine, for the longest

[Pre Chorus]
I made the changes
I thought we for the better
I don't know what changed us
I thought we'll be together

[Chorus]
Used to be mine, now it's just hi goodbye
Without a sign, you give me hi goodbye
All you do is wave when you see me
How did it get that way
Hi, hi goodbye

Hi, hi goodbye X4

[Verse 2]
Bae you should be on the way
Oh that's right you ain't coming, no more
You used to have so much say
Now you barely say nothing, no more oh

[Pre Chorus]
I made the changes
I thought we for the better
I don't know what changed us
I thought we'd be together

[Chorus]
Used to be mine, now it's just hi goodbye
Without a sign, you give me hi goodbye
All you do is wave when you see me
How did it get that way
Hi, hi goodbye

Hi, hi goodbye X4
