[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
All my niggas still trappin' gotta whip it hard (trap, trap)
From the bottom, made a milli on the boulevard
Breakin' a pot and I bring it back (bing it back)
I hit the juug and I made a sack
In the kitchen with the pitching it was hard work (hard work)
Ran off on the plug like four times
Only nigga that was trappin' bought a Bentley
Bitch suck dick good bought her Fendi
I'm a juug [?] your niggas they'll finesse ya
Walk around with a hunnid I'ma flexer
In the trap where I made it at
If the brick don't come with a stamp I'ma bring it back
Scrapin' the [?] for the [?]
Twistin' your bitch like a pretzel
I'ma stay on the stove like a tea kettle
In the Rari got a red bottom on the pedal

[Chorus: Rico Love & Rich The Kid]
Trappin' so hard I might be rich in the mornin'
(Trap, trap, trap)
Trappin' so hard I might be rich in the mornin'
(What?)
Pick up your bro drop off that bitch in the mornin'
(Your bitch)
Trappin' so hard I might be rich in the mornin'
Trappin' so hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
Trappin' so hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
Turn the lights on

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
In the trap no lights on (lights on)
Got too many snakes muhfucka you a python
Too much drank gotta pour it up
At the bank with a tank I'ma blow it up
Got a bitch with a [?] (skrrt)
Young nigga runnin' from the paparazzi (young nigga)
Telephone ring gotta catch a plane (brrr)
I been in the trap like everyday
Bad bitch [?] jump off (jump off)
Pull up in the coupe with her panties off
I been trappin' so hard
Walk around with the cash I'ont need a fuckin' double card
[?] it was hate (it was hate)
I got shooters with the Uzis and the [?]
I was in the kitchen makin' baby (baby)
I got all white [?] like the 80s

[Chorus: Rico Love & Rich The Kid]
Trappin' so hard I might be rich in the mornin'
(Trap, trap, trap)
Trappin' so hard I might be rich in the mornin'
(What?)
Pick up your bro drop off that bitch in the mornin'
(Your bitch)
Trappin' so hard I might be rich in the mornin'
Trappin' so hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
Trappin' so hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
Turn the lights on
