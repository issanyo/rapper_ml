[Intro: Rico Love]
Swagger's a powerful thing, baby!
And I don't claim to know everything in life, but I will tell you this;
You will NEVER meet a nigga like me! *laughs*
Talk to 'em Che!

[Verse 1: Le'Che Martin]
You don't know how you move me 
I feel like I'm your groupie
Wanna be on your team
Givin' you all of me, no stops, no halts, all guarantees!
I wanna be your wifey
Can't you see your life for me?
I wanna be your everything
Everything that you ask I'm gon' be !

[Hook: Le'Che Martin]
I am so fresh
Never met a girl like this before!
I am so cool
Have you always comin' back for more!
I am so sexy
Have you linin' up out the door!
And I'm on you, 'cause you're the truth!

[Verse 2: Le'Che Martin]
I make you want to settle down
Though them other girls around
Queen of your town
Talk to 'em, I'll be your lady!
You never ever thought that you'd have it in your heart to do these things
(When ya see it you'll believe it) Remember when I told you

[Hook: Le'Che Martin (Rico Love)]
I am so fresh

(Soundz ya did ya thing on this one, nigga

[Verse 3: Rico Love]
Mmm, I had to get at you, gal
'Cause your hair and your nails so natural
And that's for real, I'm a playa from the Mil-Town (Mil City)
Had a bad chick runnin wit me and she' still down!
Tellin' shorty to hop in the car
Operate on the jeans, then I doctor the bra
I can't believe how proper you are
That's why I'm steppin in you, ya so damn fresh, sexy, and cool
Talk to me, babe

[Hook: Le'Che Martin (Rico Love)]

[Hook: Le'Che Martin (Rico Love)]
