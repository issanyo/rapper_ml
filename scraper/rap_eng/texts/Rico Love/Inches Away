[Chorus]
Now that you’re inches away from me
You ain’t got nothing to say to me
I was here loving you faithfully
You ain’t do nothing but play with me
Inches away from me
I can’t believe the devil’s right here
Inches away from me, no no no no no
Face to face with my deepest fear, oh
Inches away

[Verse 1]
Perfect disguise, flawless design
Effortlessly controlled my mind
You sure pulled a fast one this time
Oh, Prince of Darkness, how you shine, yeah

[Chorus]
Now that you’re inches away from me
You ain’t got nothing to say to me
I was here loving you faithfully
You ain’t do nothing but play with me
Inches away from me
(I can’t believe the devil’s right here)
I can’t believe the devil’s right here
Inches away from me, no no no no no
Face to face with my deepest fear, oh
Inches away

[Refrain]
With nothing to say, now
You’re just inches away
I can’t believe the devil’s right here (right here)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Electric stare, they hypnotize
Love just ain’t fair, especially when you’re blind
Can’t even [?]
Heartbreak’s a, a reminder
That you hold no heart in your insides
No, no

[Chorus]
Now that you’re inches away from me
You ain’t got nothing to say to me
I was here loving you faithfully
You ain’t do nothing but play with me
Inches away from me
(I can’t believe the devil’s right here)
I can’t believe the devil’s right here
Inches away from me, no no no no no
Face to face with my deepest fear, oh
Inches away

[Refrain]
With nothing to say, now
You’re just inches away
I can’t believe the devil’s right here (right here)
(Turn the lights on!)
