[Chorus]
So why don't you save the world tomorrow?
And be my lover tonight
And I beg u to save me from my sorrow
You're the only man who loves me right

[Verse 1]
The favor part of my day is when you're here
I know when you're near
I'm losing control
Whisper something out rageaous in my ear
I'll hear u loud and clear
I want u more then u know
So why dont u save the world tomorrow
And be my lover tonight
And I beg u to save me from my sorrow
You're the only man who loves me right

[Chorus]
So why don't you save the world tomorrow?
And be my lover tonight
And I beg u to save me from my sorrow
You're the only man who loves me right

[Verse 2]
U can feel the heat from my body through my clothes
My passions explode
I can't let it go
U can be the director run this show
As long as u grab a hold
Of my body and soul

[Chorus]
So why don't you save the world tomorrow?
And be my lover tonight
And I beg u to save me from my sorrow
You're the only man who loves me right

[Bridge]
Baby come and save me now
I need u to come save me now
And I'll almost do anything
If u would rescue me again
I'm hot like fired
You're my desire
Baby I need u here with me

[Chorus]
So why don't you save the world tomorrow?
And be my lover tonight
And I beg u to save me from my sorrow
You're the only man who loves me right
