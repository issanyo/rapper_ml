[Chorus]
Day so hard, so much stress
Life won't let up, boy just rest
Lay down and let me cover you in all these kisses
So much on your mind, it weighs on your head
But baby you're worry-free in this bed
Go 'head and let me cover you in all these kisses

[Verse 1]
Lay back now 'cause you done enough
Work so hard to take care of us
Baby I'll relax your mind if you'll just let me
Sure it feels like nobody cares, out there
But you know I'm here
Don't trip about now, you can lay it down, I know it's heavy
Ooh, when you called and said you're on your way
I was waiting
Anything for my lover, anything for my babe
No hesitating

[Chorus]
Day so hard, so much stress
Life won't let up, boy just rest
Lay down and let me cover you in all these kisses
So much on your mind, it weighs on your head
But baby you're worry-free in this bed
Go 'head and let me cover you in all these kisses

[Verse 2]
Tell me baby let me know what we could do
Anything, everything you wanna do
Pick a time and place, I put it on you
Pick a time and place, I put it on, put it on
I know youâ€™re tired baby, but I know what drives you crazy
I'll take it slower baby
I know you miss these kisses

[Chorus]
Day so hard, so much stress
Life won't let up, boy just rest
Lay down and let me cover you in all these kisses
So much on your mind, it weighs on your head
But baby you're worry-free in this bed
Go 'head and let me cover you in all these kisses
Let me cover you in all these kisses
