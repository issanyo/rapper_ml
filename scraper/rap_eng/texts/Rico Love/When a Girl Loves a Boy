[Verse 1: J Sutta]
Acting I was afraid of fire
Thunder had me frighten, I've ran from the storm
And my fears turn into my desires
Now that I got you I don't run anymore

[Pre-Chorus: J Sutta]
Cause when a girl loves a boy
Words don't seem so scary
And when a girl loves a boy, yeah
But ain't she will have it

[Chorus: J Sutta]
So you should know
I'll die for you
I'll die for you
I'll die for you
Give all my life for you
I take a stand love for you
All that I have I feel it giving
For you only to enjoy
Cause when a girl loves a boy (Turn the lights on)
Cause when a girl loves a boy
(Mr. World Wide)
Cause when a girl loves a boy

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I'll die for you, ride for you
Lie for you, cry for you baby
You're my everything, queen
My woman, my wife, my lady
You're my dream, I sleep when I am dead
So you're all I see, and if they take you
Then god is sure as hell, go ahead and take me
Love me, Love me, Love me, Love me, Love me
And tell me you need me, you need me
You need me, you need me
And tell me you want me, you want me
You want me, you want me
You're my heart, til death do its part

[Pre-Chorus: J Sutta]
Cause when a girl loves a boy
Words don't seem so scary
And when a girl loves a boy, yeah
But ain't she will have it

[Chorus: J Sutta]
So you should know
I'll die for you
I'll die for you
I'll die for you
Give all my life for you
I take a stand love for you
All that I have I feel it giving
For you only to enjoy
Cause when a girl loves a boy
Cause when a girl loves a boy
Cause when a girl loves a boy

[Bridge: J Sutta]
Just one last kiss
Be my dying wish
As living without you
There's no reason
Why would I exist
There would be no sense of me breathing
Can't leave life like this
The only one I am fighting for

[Pre-Chorus: J Sutta]
Cause when a girl loves a boy
Words don't seem so scary
And when a girl loves a boy, yeah
But ain't she will have it

[Chorus: J Sutta]
So you should know
I'll die for you
I'll die for you
I'll die for you (Die for me girl)
Give all my life for you
I take a stand love for you
All that I have I feel it giving
For you only to enjoy
Cause when a girl loves a boy (turn the lights on)
(Die for me girl)
Cause when a girl loves a boy
(Die for me girl)
Cause when a girl loves a boy
