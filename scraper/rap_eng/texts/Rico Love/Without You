[Instrumental]

I can't win, I can't reign
I will never win this game
Without you, without you
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you, without you


I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by
Without you, without you
I can't rest, I can't fight
All I need is you and I
Without you, without you

[Hook]
(Oooh)
Oh oh oh!
You! You! You!
(Oooh)
Without...
You! You! You!
Without...you

[Verse 2]
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night
Without you, without you
You
I can't look, I'm so blind
I lost my heart, I lost my mind
Without you, without you

[Hook:]
(Oooh)
Oh oh oh!
You! You! You!
(Oooh)
Without...
You! You! You!
Without...you

[Outro:]
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you, without you
Without...you
