[Hook - Rico Love]
If she's unemployed, I got that work
I put her on, she go berserk
She lose her pants, she lose her shirt
You want to ball, you gotta work
Yeah you know I got that work [x4]

[Verse 1 - Young Chris]
Shawty take it up and down the pole
And she take it up and down the road
Division 1 we get it done
Tell the club bring another brick of ones
Shower on you cowards, got a couple hours
Heavy in the duffel, tonight she making double
Tonight I'm feeling good, I heard you work mean
Want to see it for myself, now do it like the twerk team
Baby unemployed, hey we got that work
Come up out them pants, come up out that shirt
See how good you dance, Imma find you a pole
Strap on my magnum, jump inside that hole

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Yo Gotti]
Yeah you know I got that guap, motherfucker I'm balling
Money in this got bitches on they knees crawling
Bag it up, bag it up, you made me the trash bag
Cook it up, break it down, slang it out the glass bag
Work it out, work it out, shawty know how to twerk it out
I just blew a 50 piece, VIP, purped it out
Me and Young Chris, club onix, that's a holiday
Me and Zilla, north and south Memphis, that's a lot of yay
Hey
That's a lot of yay [x4]
