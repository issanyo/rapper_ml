[Chorus] x2
Ask anybody 'bout me they gonna know
I be on the road
I travel the globe
I get up and go
Out here looking for a new bae
I can't wait to love up on you bae

[Verse 1]
Don't want no more boy problems, boy problems
Oh, I think I need man now
But I don't need a handout
You can keep your problems, your problems
Oh, I need you to understand now
I'm looking for a homie, lover, friend now

[Pre-Chorus]
But Lord knows it's so hard, its so hard
To find one in my city
And that's why I travel the world, I know he's out there

[Chorus] x2
Ask anybody 'bout me they gonna know
I be on the road
I travel the globe
I get up and go
Out here looking for a new bae
I can't wait to love up on you babe

[Hook]
New bae
New, new, new, new bae
New, new, new bae

[Verse 2]
I don't need no issues, no issues
You gotta have a plan now
But I don't give a damn now, if you call me stuck up
As long as you call me a bad mothafucka
As long as you know not any man can touch her
As long as you know I won't settle for no sucka
(Down ass with her brown ass you know can trust her)

[Pre-Chorus]
But Lord knows it's so hard, its so hard
To find one in my city
And that's why I travel the world, I know he's out there

[Chorus] x2
Ask anybody 'bout me they gonna know
I be on the road
I travel the globe
I get up and go
Out here looking for a new bae
I can't wait to love up on you bae

[Rico Love]
Turn the lights on

[Hook] x2
New bae
New, new, new, new bae
New, new, new bae
