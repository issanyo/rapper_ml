[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hello, good morning, how you doing? What the move is?
Of "Welcome to the Future," I'm the Cap'n of the Cool Kids
The revolution's never been televised
Great booty, better thighs, I ain't wanna tell her bye
First I tell her hi, then I give her one and let her fly
Never tell a lie, tonight you couldn't find a better guy
King shit, flyer than anyone you get seen with
Gangsta distinguished, cool as a penguin
Got a team of 'em on the field, finna bring wit'
G5 waiting, fly away at my convenience
You seen Tip, checking in a 5-star suite
With some 5-star freaks, getting high all week (Let's go)
Catch me in the week, I was up all night when y'all sleep
In a fast car, superbad broads, back seat
That's me, see I'm nothing nice, fuck a couple nights
With the moon say goodbye and the sun greeting us like


[Pre-Chorus 2: Diddy]
Hello, good morning (Let's go, let's ride)
Hello (Yeah, come on), good morning
Hello, good evenin'
You blow, you fiendin'
'Cause you know that you really need it
And I'm the one that you wanna be with
But right now, baby you're dreaming
(Wake up and turn the lights on)

[Chorus: Diddy & Dirty Money]
'Cause I been leaning on the bar, looking cleaner than the Tsar
And these broads won't give me my props
Twenty-five on the bank, I be stunting on they ass
And ya mad cause the bitch won't stop
Got your boyfriend feeling like a groupie
(You know, you know, you know, we on that)
Still life but it's looking like a movie...
(You know, you know, you know, we on that)
And everybody know who the truth be
(You know, you know, you know, we on that)
I blow cause I'm blowing on that oo-wee!!
(You know, you know, you know, we on that)

Hello (Let's go), good morning (Let's work)

Ayo, Ayo, turn me up a lil' bit more

Make you feel good too, let's work
Don't stop I see you, let's work

[Verse 2: Diddy]
Uh, how fly is he?
Yo' baby momma Cry for Me like Jodeci (let's go)
So how you not notice me?

Little did he know how that nigga Diddy flow
How that nigga Diddy go
So hard like a crowbar, still getting dough

Can you feel it? Nothing can save ya
Uh, it's that Dirty Money (Turn the lights on!)

And everybody know who the truth be
(You know, you know, you know, we on that)
I blow cause I'm blowing on that oo-wee!!
(You know, you know, you know, we on that)
