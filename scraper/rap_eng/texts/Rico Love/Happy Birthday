[Verse 1]
Wanna make her feel like she just turned 21
Wanna take her out with all her friends and let 'em all get fucked up
Throw an after party in the penthouse when we done
And Ion wanna see none of y'all walking around with empty cups
Turn the lights on, you me to tell me you flew this far, to be acting all bougie
Them heels, that dress, you bad and you ought to be shaking ya booty

[Pre-Hook]
Oh shit, here we are, champagne, caviar
Poke your lips out, blow them candles, you’re a superstar
Oh shit, here we are, champagne, caviar
Poke your lips out, blow them candles, you’re a superstar

[Hook]
Happy birthday, happy birthday
I really just wanna have a good time tonight
Happy birthday
I really just wanna have a good time tonight

[Verse 2]
Of course I'm trying to flaunt you
I'll take you out to space I'm dying to launch you
I want you, I'mma always want you, you know I'mma want you
Can't say if I died cause I'm never going to
Fuck around and spend a hundred fifty on you
Wuarter on clothes, another fifty on shoes
Look so good with them jeans on
You should hit the surgeon and put some titties on too
Won't lie, time zooms by in Mumbai
Dinner in Abu Dhabi, the thrills I provide
Show you what the world 'bout, even bring your girls out
Whole lot of fly shit, you gon' soon try, yeah, turn the lights on

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3]
I wish we could celebrate, I wish we could drink 'til we levitate
I wish that our ex's would never hate, and when they mix my shit give it hella bass
I told her zazazz, zzazz, zzza, how you make an outfit look so exquisite?
If I say hop, say how high and rip it, if I get knocked, then you better visit
Yo I think I gotta thing for them débutantes
The ones that be in the upper echelon
It ain't you birthday, but you in you birthday suit
So I might as well give you all the head you want

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

I really just wanna have a good time tonight
I really just wanna have a good time tonight
