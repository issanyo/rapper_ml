[Verse 1]
I know you probably think a girl like me is oh, so vain
Because I love it when the camera man screams out my name (uh huh)
He says "Hey girl, look here, turn left, right, up, down, POSE! "
And I feel so beautiful while I'm wearing these designer clothes

I feel so pretty, picture perfect, beautiful (picture perfect, beautiful)
Don't you feel pretty?... Like your putting on a show? (a, a, a show)
And the cameras go...

[Verse 2]
Now I'm feeling like a queen, I love your eyes on me
My hair is blowing in the wind I'm so sexy and free
And when my make-up is on I feel like a rock-star
The sun is shining on me oh yes, I'm living large

I feel so pretty, picture perfect, beautiful (picture perfect, beautiful)
Don't you feel pretty?... Like your putting on a show? (a, a, a show)

Snap, snap, freeze... pose, look back, look back
Man, I ain't never seen a girl walk like that (yeah... like that)
(Uh, let's go!)
I got my kodak acts to magic, I grab it and I click and flash
They grab they cameraphones, whenever I be switching pass
So ultra-fabolous, my jeans, my jeans, they fit me crazy!
Them boys be yellin' out "You beautiful baby! "

I feel so pretty, picture perfect, beautiful (picture perfect, beautiful)
