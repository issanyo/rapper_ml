[Verse 1]
Throwed, 'bout to OD on PJ
Five cherry bombs for me and send three to the DJ
That's my nigga, that's my nigga, holmes
I don't know him but he played my favorite Jigga song
Where the fuck my keys? Oh shit, I valeted
Wit' this pretty bitch who visitin' from LA
I caught a contact, she smokin' Cali
She my motivation, shout out to Kelly
Whoa, lover, I hope you go down
And I'm fucked up but so the fuck what?
I'm 'bout to order me a couple more rounds
I'mma ball so hard that she gotta think about a nigga
Whenever she touch this town

[Hook]
'Bout to do some freaky thangs, back seat of the Range
I paid for that flight so sex will be exchanged
I heard yo' head was craze, well, my dick is deranged
'Bout to blow yo' back up out the frame
Champagne is my Viagra, champagne is my Viagra
Yeah, turn the lights on

[Verse 2]
Rollin' down the highway listenin' to my shit
Jumpin' in that pussy head first like a mosh pit
I ain't into cuffin' but I hold that pussy hostage
Hope you keep a secret, don't wanna wake up on Bossip
Please don't take no pictures, please don't take no pictures
'Specially wit' my jewelry on, damn, these hoes so vicious
A lotta ass up in yo' jeans, I got a $100,000 in my britches
Let's stop by Take One and shower bitches wit' these riches
Heh, hood nigga to the death, ho
Eyes low, but I don't want no rest though
I just wanna put it in, and press "go"
And I really hope you lesbo

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Throwed, 'bout to OD on PJ
Five cherry bombs for me and send three to the DJ
That's my nigga, that's my nigga, holmes
I don't know him but he played my favorite Jigga song
Please don't take no pictures, please don't take no pictures
'Specially wit' my jewelry on, damn, these hoes so vicious
A lotta ass up in yo' jeans, I got $100,000 in my britches
Let's stop by Take One and shower bitches wit' these riches
(Shower bitches wit' these riches)
Let's stop by Take One and shower bitches wit' these riches
And I really hope you lesbo
