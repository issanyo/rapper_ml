[Intro]
Hello, hello, hello heartbreak
Hello, hello, hello heartbreak

[Verse 1]
I got a strange connection to pain
I can't seem to walk away from hurt
I'm always running into dangers
I know I need protection in case
But  his affection's what I'm longing for?
It cuts me deep, but I'm still wanting more

[Chorus]
Hello heartbreak
It's good to see you
Happiness came
But it just lets me down
(Hello, hello, hello hello heartbreak)
Hey there sadness
I know I need you
'Cause when all else fails
You'll always be around
(Hello, hello, hello hello heartbreak)

[Verse 2]
I got this huge attraction to you
I must be going out my mind, wasting time
I'm breaking deep inside

[Chorus]
Hello heartbreak (Hello)
It's good to see you (See you)
Happiness came
But it just lets me down
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)
Hey there sadness (Hey there)
I know I need you (Sadness)
'Cause when all else fails
You'll always be around
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)

[Bridge - Rap]

[Chorus]
Hello heartbreak
It's good to see you
Happiness came
But it just lets me down
(Hello, hello, hello heartbreak)
Hey there sadness
(Hey there sadness)
I know I need you
'Cause when all else fails
You'll always be around
(Hello, hello, hello heartbreak)
