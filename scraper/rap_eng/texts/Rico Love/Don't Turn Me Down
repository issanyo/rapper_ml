[verse]
Hey love, hey love
Don't tell me you changed your mind

I was hoping
Tomorrow morning
We'd wake up, together
Just tell me which side is your side

[hook]
Don't tell me now
Don't tell me, don't tell me
That you feel like we're moving too fast
Don't turn me down
Cuz we made it all the way across town
Don't tell me, don't tell me
Can't believe you gonna do me like that
Don't turn me down

[verse]
Hey love, hey love
I traveled through space and time

And i was thinking
Since we been drinking
We'd make love, together
Told me you like that plan just fine
(you know you did)

[hook]
Don't tell me now
Don't tell me, don't tell me
That you feel like we're moving too fast
Don't turn me down
Cuz we made it all the way across town
Don't tell me, don't tell me
Can't believe you gonna do me like that
Don't turn me down

[bridge]
I'm only, here for your service
Don't tell me, i make you nervous
Using flattery to comfort me, somehow
(that shit don't work)

It's like you tease me, on purpose
I promise, this will be worth it
Don't turn me down

[hook]
Don't tell me now
Don't tell me, don't tell me
That you feel like we're moving too fast
Don't turn me down
Cuz we made it all the way across town
Don't tell me, don't tell me
Can't believe you gonna do me like that
Don't turn me down

Can't believe you gonna do me like that...
