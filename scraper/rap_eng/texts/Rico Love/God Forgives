[Pre-Chorus]
I hope my daughter don't hate me like her mama did
I don't
I hope my son wants to be like his daddy one day
When he gets grown
Hope I'm forgiven one day for all of the things (yeah yeah)
That I did wrong
I hope my daughter don't hate me like her mama did
I don't

[Chorus]
God forgives, but she won't
God forgives, but she won't
God forgives

[Verse 1]
He's a provider, he's a provider
Mixed with a liar, only to hide ya
From a truth that just might break your heart
Selfish desire, still paying for the shit that I did on my first album
So tell me what's the use of changing when I know
That you'll never let it go
When it's all said and done

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope my daughter don't hate me like her mama did
I don't (nah)
I hope my son wants to be like his daddy one day
When he gets grown
Your daddy's still a good man
Hope I'm forgiven one day for all the things (oh-oh)
That I did wrong
I hope my daughter don't hate me like her mama did
I don't

[Chorus]
God forgives, but she won't
God forgives, but she won't
God forgives

[Bridge]
I'll teach my son not to cheat
'Cause I know that no one taught me
Teach that boy not to need
The things that these streets are offering
'Cause in the end you're left with nothing
Except the women you were fucking
But by then you don't want 'em
Ain't it crazy, ain't it something
Now the court tells you when you can see your babies
All because you hurt that lady

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope my daughter don't hate me like her mama did
I don't
I hope my son wants to be like his daddy one day, yeah
When he gets grown
Your daddy's still a good man
Hope I'm forgiven one day for a lot of things (oh-oh)
That I did wrong
I hope my daughter don't hate me like her mama did
I don't

[Chorus]
God forgives but she won't
God forgives but she won't
God forgives
