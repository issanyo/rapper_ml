[Verse 1: Rico Love]
Not afraid to tell you everything
I'm latching on with shock
Could lock you inside a dream
Keep your name in all my convos
Pictures in my condo
Hard to believe but girl I love you way more than it seems
Shawty I wonder if we can go
Paint the town like Van Gough
Even if you busy
I'm like fuck the other plans though
I become obsessed
Every dress is the best I've ever seen
And I'm trapped in your attraction
Hope you latching on to me

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
(This, is the remix)
You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
Iâ€™m latching on, babe, now I know what I have found
(Turn the lights on)

[Bridge 1: Rico Love]
So if you ever feel like there's someone calling you name
That's when you know there's someone near you baby

[Bridge 2: Sam Smith (Rico Love)]
I feel we're close enough
(I think we're close, I think we're close enough baby)
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?
I feel we're close

[Chorus: Sam Smith & Rico Love] (x3)
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
(This, is the remix)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

[Verse 3: Sam Smith]
I'm so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it? You got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart bleed out my chest?

[Bridge 1] + [Bridge 2] + [Hook] (x2)

[Outro: Sam Smith]
I'm latching on to you
I won't let go of you
I'm latching on to you
I won't let go of you
I won't let go, I won't let go
I won't let go, I won't let go
