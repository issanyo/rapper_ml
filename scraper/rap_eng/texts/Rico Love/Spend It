[Intro: Rico Love]

Spend it, Spend it
Spin it, Spin it, Spin it
Spend it, Spend it
Spin it, Spin it, Spin it
Spend it, Spend it
Spin it, Spin it, Spin it
Spend it, Spend it
Spin it, Spin it, Spin it

[Verse 1: Rico Love]

Ooh shit on that floor
Bad bitch don’t be pursue her
Hit it once run back to it
Waka Flocka, O'Lets Do It
Bring it back when I was nineteen
But I ain’t have none of this ice on
Had about twenty seven dollars in my pocket
No wallet just some O-G Nike's on
Running around with my demo tape
She said, yeah little nigga that’s a nice song
But she ain't want to take that gamble
Now I use her big old ass to roll dice on

[Pre-Hook]

All she ever talks about is money, clothes and spending
Geography and shopping sprees will surely get you woman
Alcohol and credit cards ignoring all your feelings
That’s why we chasing all these millions
We keep screaming
Money over hoes, money over hoes
But soon as we get
Money then we go, running for the hoes
You keep saying that it’s currency over these bitches
What you gonna do, what you gonna do, with all them riches

[Hook]

You gonna spend it on a bitch
Talking all that shit but you know you’re gone
You gonna spend it on a bitch
Talking all that shit but you know you’re gone
You gonna spend it on a bitch
Talking all that shit but you know you’re gone
You gonna spend it on a bitch
What you gonna' do, what you gonna' do, with all them riches
Spend it, Spend it
Spin it, Spin it, Spin it
Spend it, Spend it
Spin it, Spin it, Spin it
(You gonna spend it on a bitch)
Spend it, Spend it
Spin it, Spin it, Spin it
Spend it, Spend it
Spin it, Spin it, Spin it


[Verse 2: Rico Love]

Niggas screaming money over hoes
Then hit the strip club and spend that money on them hoes
Got the top off talking about how you stunting on them bitches
Then you meet a bitch take her out and spend hundreds on them bitches
Nigga, you know this shit vicious
Seventeen hundred dollars at
Out to eat with all her friends
She might not even let you beat
In the streets we be like fuck them
But we're just trying to fuck them
The topic of our discussions
Boy, that bullshit ain't about nothing you know

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T.]

King of diamonds, king of tricks
Said it before but I still mean it
Made a check, throw a check, blow a check
That was re-up for the dope but you had to spend it
Cause she a fucking trick
All off in the champagne room and ain't got bubbly (bubbly)
Yeh, you barely got to see the pussy
But you claimed you fucked it
Where your dollars at? She asking
Everybody know that you still heavy
It's crazy, got a deal, signed for a mill
Went first round pick drafting (rich)
So you going to ball on them
Hit the mall buy it all on them
I thought it was M.O.B
More like whatever she needs
