[Intro]
I'm not afraid
Afraid of the dark
So turn the lights off
(Turn the lights off)

[Verse 1]
All I need is a DJ and a whole lotta noise (oh)
A dance floor that's packed
With fly girls and a whole lotta boys (oh)

[Pre-Hook]
We goin' up down back forth
Right to the rhythm
Seem like I always get the feelin'

[Hook]
Any time they turn the lights off
Be my guest
Cause when the lights off
I'm in my best
So turn the lights off
I'm not afraid
Afraid of the dark
Afraid of the dark
So turn the lights off

[Post-Hook]
We can get closer
We can get closer
We can get closer
If we just turn the lights off
We can get closer (I'm not afraid)
We can get closer (Afraid of the dark)
We can get closer (Afraid of the dark)
If we just turn the lights off (So turn the lights off)

[Verse 2]
Just get me in a corner
And I'll do my dance (oh)
And if you're nice
You can do what you wanna
Do with your hands (oh)

[Pre-Hook]
We goin' up down back forth
Right to the rhythm
Seem like I always get the feelin'

[Hook]
Any time they turn the lights off
Be my guest
Cause when the lights off
I'm in my best
So turn the lights off
I'm not afraid
Afraid of the dark
Afraid of the dark
So turn the lights off

[Post-Hook]
We can get closer
We can get closer
We can get closer
If we just turn the lights off
We can get closer (I'm not afraid)
We can get closer (Afraid of the dark)
We can get closer
If we just turn the lights off

[Bridge]
You can tell from how I walk
We don't need no talk
I ain't afraid of the dark
We don't need no more
I, I, I'm looking for you

[Pre-Hook]
We goin' up down back forth
Right to the rhythm
Seem like I always get the feelin'

[Hook]
Any time they turn the lights off
Be my guest
Cause when the lights off
I'm in my best
So turn the lights off
I'm not afraid
Afraid of the dark
Afraid of the dark
So turn the lights off

[Post-Hook]
I'm not afraid
Afraid of the dark
Afraid of the dark
So turn the lights off
