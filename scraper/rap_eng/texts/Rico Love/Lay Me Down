She love me up and lay me down!
Ay what she do?
She love me up and lay me down!
Ay what she do?
She love me up and lay me down!

I love it when she lay me down!
Do it baby stick it (down)
Do it baby stick it (down)
Do it baby, stick it, stick it babygirl!
Do it baby stick it (down)
Do it baby stick it (down)
Do it baby, stick it, stick it babygirl!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I said, get right, but you know what I got
Got them fixing up they make-up when I walk up in the spot
Got they eye shadow on and they lips on shine
With a smile on her face, when her lips on mine
See I'm a big freak
Feed her big peter, beat that pussy up so good she don't want me to eat her

First I meet her then I beat her...whatever she need
A few of these turn a nigga wifey to a cheater
Keep her!
Head down and her ass up here
Got her hair fucked up and her lipstick smeared
Take a city bitch here or a bitch from the boonies
Wit a man at the crib but he don't know what he doing...hold up
Truefully she knew she do me, but she knew me
Introduce me and she blew me and then she didn't say nothing to me
You don't like it then sue me
She my biggest fan now
When I spend a day in town, then she hurry up and lay me down..down!

Do it baby stick it (down)
Do it baby stick it (down)
Do it baby, stick it, stick it babygirl!
Do it baby stick it (down)

Do it baby, stick it, stick it babygirl!

[Verse 2: T.I.]
On the hush hush, keep it low key
Attitude in check,cause you with a O.G
Got that thing on lock, wanna see the door key
Got dope dick, give it to her til she O.D
I'm a put it in her in the life, give her what she missin
She yo wife well she off limits, well that is unless you slipping...
And I catch her on a mission in my hotel lobby
Trying to run into somebody, end up at the after party
With a stripper body, itty bitty waist
Big ol' booty begging me to decorate her pretty face

(Hey..ok)
What can I say?
She requested and I deliver
Broad looking for that raw, shawty I'm that nigga

Ain't playin witcha, full of Remy high sober
You catch me in your city lick me up I bend you over
Know the... women want me and niggas think its the money
But she should be paying me though for all this good dick she gettin from me, from me
All in yo tummy when....
