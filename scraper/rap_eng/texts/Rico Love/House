[Verse 1 : Rico Love]
I be in North Carolina
I be in South Carolina
I be in all parts of Georgia
I be draped up in designer
When I be down in Orlando I hit the street named Letonya
She be dancing to Cleo she like to smoke marijuana
All up in these here I say we trying to write
Dark skin or red bone no I don’t got no type
Kinda kiss on each other yea thats the kind I like
And I’m thinking it’s gonna be that kind of night

Now I know you like my lazy flow
But here goes my crazy flow

Doing it for my 80s babies tho
Shot them girls and bought them all don’t go unless they’re paid do go

Baby mama begging me to choose her
She say yea I love my hubby but that boy a loser
I’m yours till the end
