[Intro]
I guess we both on that bullshit, I guess we both on that bullshit
Turn the lights on

[Hook]
Oops, I almost told your boyfriend that I love you (I'm just playing)
Oops, I almost grabbed your hand last time I saw you
Cause Ion even know your nigga like that, you be with some girls who know my girl but that's all though
Call hang up, and you hit me right back, that's that bullshit, we both on bullshit

[Verse 1]
We should get a room somewhere
Where there’s just me and you somewhere, pick and choose somewhere
So much we can do somewhere
We both got so much to lose somewhere, ocean views somewhere

[Pre-Hook]
Crazy how it turns to something
Knowing that we dead wrong
Especially, when we act like nothing happen
Put our clothes back on and head home, damn

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You can rub my back somewhere
I’ll be grabbing on your ass somewhere, acting bad somewhere
A whole lot of cash somewhere
We'll be tearing up the ave somewhere, shopping bags somewhere

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Bridge]
I know I know I know, I'm so trifling
I know I know I know, I'm so trifling
I guess we both on that bullshit
I guess we both on that bullshit

[Hook]
