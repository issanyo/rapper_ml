[Intro]
Yeahhh, Feel like falling in love tonight (turn the lights off)

[Verse 1]
All the suns aligning, it feels perfect
Melodies and verses flowing through my mind
I wanna lean in for a kiss, I know it's worth it
I barely know you baby, but I know it's time

[Hook]
You see the way the strobe lights are dancing
I look in your eyes and I feel like falling in love tonight (tonight)
Falling in love tonight
And baby I'm not fore-taking chances (romance is in the air)
Feel like falling in love tonight
Falling' in love tonight (I hope you're ready baby)
And when the moon gets high, let's start with some kissing (falling in love tonight)
I heard the wind whisper your name in the air (falling in love tonight)
Last night you're the one I was missing (falling in love tonight)
But tonight you're standing right there (falling in love tonight)

[Verse 2]
It's like a movie, the DJ plays the soundtrack
And I feel like I found that man who owns my heart
I shoulda knew it, the moment that you blew in
You know what you're doing, the best part is about to start

[Hook]
You see the way the strobe lights are dancing
I look in your eyes and I feel like falling in love tonight (tonight)
Falling in love tonight
And baby I'm not fore-taking chances (romance is in the air)
Feel like falling in love tonight
Falling' in love tonight (I hope you're ready baby)
And when the moon gets high, let's start with some kissing (falling in love tonight)
I heard the wind whisper your name in the air (falling in love tonight)
Last night you're the one I was missing (falling in love tonight)
But tonight you're standing right there (falling in love tonight)

[Verse 3]
And it's like I'm up on cloud nine
'Cause I know I found my (I really think I found my future in this club)
Caught up in a trance here
When I saw you stand there
I think I'm ready baby

[Hook]
You see the way the strobe lights are dancing
I look in your eyes and I feel like falling in love tonight (tonight)
Falling in love tonight
And baby I'm not fore-taking chances (romance is in the air)
Feel like falling in love tonight
Falling' in love tonight (I hope you're ready baby)
And when the moon gets high, let's start with some kissing (falling in love tonight)
I heard the wind whisper your name in the air (falling in love tonight)
Last night you're the one I was missing (falling in love tonight)
But tonight you're standing right there (falling in love tonight)
