[Intro]
Hardly breathing
Hardly breathing

[Verse 1]
I really wanna take you back
It's killing me watching you walk away, yeah
But my head ain't okay with that
And Lord knows how much I want you, babe
It hurts me that you can't stay, ah

[Chorus]
This old heart of mine won't let you break it
Not again, not again
It hurt so many times and I can't take it, not again
'Cause I'm hardly breathing
One more teary eye, or sleepless nights
Just might kill this heart of mine
Hardly breathing, hardly breathing

[Verse 2]
Begging won't do nothing
Forgave you many times along the way
Yeah, yeah, ah
My mama said 'Don't trust him'
But deep inside my soul I found
A place and now I want you out, baby

[Chorus]
This old heart of mine won't let you break it
Not again, not again
It hurt so many times and I can't take it, not again
'Cause I'm hardly breathing
One more teary eye, the sleepless nights
Just might kill this heart of mine
Hardly breathing, hardly breathing

[Bridge]
Feels like I'm on my last life line
And I can't take a chance
Of not being able to breathe again
Another heartbreak and I might die inside
So I learned from the last time
That loving you ain't worth losing my life

[Chorus]
This old heart of mine won't let you break it
Not again, not again
It hurt so many times and I can't take it, not again
'Cause I'm hardly breathing
One more teary eye, the sleepless nights
Just might kill this heart of mine
Hardly breathing
Hardly breathing
Just might kill this heart of mine
