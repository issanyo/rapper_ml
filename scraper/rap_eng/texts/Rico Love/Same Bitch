[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Show up when it's closing
Turn up then I go in
With me, myself, and I
And just a couple of my brohans
Cuz I don't need no homeland
Security, my own man
That means I am a grown man
Want beef and then we go HAM
Like, whoa damn, that old man
She twerkin' it with no hands
These other niggas hatin'
They remind me of my old friends
Golden and I'm glowin'
My shoes is Ricky Owen
Coke man
My business ain't the only thing her nose in
People takin' pictures, I ain't even posin'
Couple famous niggas make these bitches slow dance
Reality, she sweatin' me
Her fantasy is sexin' me
Just for standin' next to me
Will make you a celebrity

[Hook]
Don't get too close, too close
I might come on to you
Don't get too close, too close
I'm warnin' you
Cause if we fuck tonight
Tomorrow, you'll be famous
Just the standin' next to me
Will make you a celebrity
Cause if we fuck tonight
Tomorrow, you'll be famous

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Same bitch in my Vanquish
Ass in my Aston, lane switch
When the paint drip when I blast past
Swag on a champagne drip
Let it splash on 'em
Bang this, I ain't pay shit
You spent your last on 'em
(Yeah ho) $1000 jeans, call them Balmain
(Yeah ho) Life is so ghetto fab, call me Paul Cain
That's the reason why I'm with her
These other bitches bitter
I'm the quickest picker-upper
I will hit her then I'll quit her
Then I give her to my niggas
I'm no kidder, split her kitty litter
Finger in her shitter
Then forget her like we never did her
Reality, she sweatin' me
Her fantasy is sexin' me
Just for standin' next to me
Will make you a celebrity

[Hook]
Don't get too close, too close
I might come on to you
Don't get too close, too close
I'm warnin' you
Cause if we fuck tonight
Tomorrow, you'll be famous
Just the standin' next to me
Will make you a celebrity
Cause if we fuck tonight
Tomorrow, you'll be famous

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Snowin', blowin'
Frozen, coke land, snowman
My business ain't the only thing her nose in
Went from ex-pretty boy crook slash dope man
To handin' out hundred dollar bills to the doorman
Now somebody please let the hoes in
Now somebody please let my bros in
Boy, you won't believe how my foes end?
Overnight celebrities, they party 'til the show ends

[Hook]
Don't get too close, too close
I might come on to you
Don't get too close, too close
I'm warnin' you
Cause if we fuck tonight
Tomorrow, you'll be famous
Just the standin' next to me
Will make you a celebrity
Cause if we fuck tonight
Tomorrow, you'll be famous
