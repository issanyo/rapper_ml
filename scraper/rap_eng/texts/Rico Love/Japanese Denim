[Verse 1:]
All the hatin' ain't gonna get you paid
All they talking gonna get you laid
Sell you a record for two hundred K
And buy a Rollie with a diamond face
What you talking bout hater, what you talking bout
In that little apartment nigga you can barely walk around
Living room so big I could probably drive a car round
If you talking shit nigga
I might turn this car around

[Bridge:]
I got a few compliments for some bad whores
But because of them
Nigga I'mma act an asshole

[Chorus:]
Got on my favorite leather jacket and my jeans with fifty gees in them
And not to mention that have on Japanese denim
I’m the flyest motherfucker in this motherfuckering club
Surrounded by all the niggas that I love
Surrounded by bunch of bitches I could fuck
And I couple killers who don't really give a fuck

[Verse 2:]
All that snitchin' ain't gonna set you free
All that wishing gonna make you Me
Dropped out of collage, I got no degree
But black cards got no limit
Call me Master P
What you drilling for nigga
What you grilling for
And you got my old girl
What you, what you stealing for?
On that loud talk let me know you’re in your feelings though
I think in all these disscusions all I feel is …

[Bridge + Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
If you touch it till you make it hard
Tomorrow I’mma tell you to quit your job
Get you up out of this titty bar
And put your name top of my platnium credit cards
Where you shopping at baby, where you shopping at?
You got a garage baby I’mma put it dropping at
Ain't no cheap tickets, Vegas we be copping that
1st class, drivin' g5's
Wearing stocking caps

[Bridge + Chorus]

[Instrumental Interlude]
