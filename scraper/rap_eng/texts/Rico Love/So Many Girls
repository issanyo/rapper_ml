[Intro: P. Diddy]
The king is back
Hey ladies, you know what time it is
You ready, playboy?
Usher, baby
Let's get them

[Verse 1: Usher + (P. Diddy)]
You looking good
So fucking good, I wanna celebrate
And I love the way you do it
Girl, you so fly, you 'bout to levitate
And as the lights bounce off your gown
Baby, I can't help but stare
And as the lights are going down
Sparkles flash up in the air
It feel real good in here

[Chorus: Usher + (P. Diddy)]
So many girls, so we need champagne
Relax, maintain
Wait a minute, let me do my thing
But I still won't spill my drink
So many girls, so we need champagne
Relax, maintain
Wait a minute, let me do my thing
But I still won't spill my drink
So many girls! (Asians, Caucasian, Bajan, Jamaican)
So many girls! (Brazilian, I swear I got a million)
So many girls! (Egyptian, do you fit that the description?)
So many girls! (all over the world, all over the world)

[Bridge 1]
Tell the waitress I need another round
You hear that bassline coming through the ground?
You know it's on when they make that sound
I could take you home right now
Now, tell the waitress I need another round
You hear that bassline coming through the ground?
You know it's on when they make that sound
I could take you home right now
So many girls
I'ma need you, and you, and you, and you, right here

[Verse 2]
We on that tr√≥n
So everything is in slow motion now (going to slow it down for you, baby)
This bottle's almost gone (I'ma need another)
But I still ain't trying to slow it down (take your time, baby)
And when the DJ says, "Last call"
I'll be standing on the bar
Screaming from the window to the walls
It feels good to be a star
You got a light for my cigar? Fire it up

[Chorus]
So many girls, so we need champagne
Relax, maintain
Wait a minute, let me do my thing
But I still won't spill my drink
So many girls, so we need champagne
Relax, maintain
Wait a minute, let me do my thing
But I still won't spill my drink
So many girls! (Asians, Caucasian, Bajan, Jamaican)
So many girls! (Brazilian, I swear I got a million)
So many girls! (Egyptian, do you fit that the description?)
So many girls! (all over the world, all over the world)

[Bridge 2]
Can't decide which one I'll be taking home
I could take you home right now, s-so many girls
They're ready, I'm the one they're waiting on
But I feel I can turn you out

[Chorus]
So many girls, so we need champagne
Relax, maintain
Wait a minute, let me do my thing
But I still won't spill my drink
So many girls, so we need champagne
Relax, maintain
Wait a minute, let me do my thing
But I still won't spill my drink
So many girls! (Asians, Caucasian, Bajan, Jamaican)
So many girls! (Brazilian, I swear I got a million)
So many girls! (Egyptian, do you fit that the description?)
So many girls! (all over the world, all over the world)

[Bridge 1]
Tell the waitress I need another round
You hear that bassline coming through the ground?
You know it's on when they make that sound
I could take you home right now
Now, tell the waitress I need another round
You hear that bassline coming through the ground?
You know it's on when they make that sound
I could take you home right now
So many girls

[Outro]
Usher, yeah
Back with this one, baby
This time, we ain't going nowhere
I see you Mal
Danja
Yeah, come on
Turn the lights off
