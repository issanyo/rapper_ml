[Verse 1]
I wish there could be more days in summer
I wish that autumn wouldn't come so soon
'Cause when the sun goes away I'm left in the shade
Oh, I wish that you could warm me in the winter
They say springtime is so beautiful
But I see nothing but rain and short windy days
And I only feel safe
When your arms are wrapped around me

[Chorus]
So forget the clouds, I don't feel the rain
Even thought the four seasons may change (change)
I see the sun when I hear your name
(I see the sun it's in your eyes and I just know)
You give me a reason, a reason to start again
(A reason to start again)
Yeah, hey, yeah

[Verse 2]
I wish there could be more days in summer
I wish that autumn wouldn't come so soon
'Cause when the sun goes away I'm left in the shade
I love to see the leaves fall in September
And the snow drops in December just the same
But it leaves me in a daze, can't wait to see your face
And I only feel safe
When you're arms are wrapped around me

[Chorus]
So forget the clouds (forget the clouds)
I don't feel the rain (feel the rain)
Even thought the four seasons may change (change)
I see the sun when I hear your name
(I see the sun it's in your eyes and I just know)
You give me a reason, a reason to start again
(A reason to start again)

[Bridge]
I only feel safe when I'm in your arms
It's another day that we can't escape
It won't be too long 'til love finds its way
To start again

[Chorus]
So forget the clouds (yeah, yeah)
I don't feel the rain (yeah, yeah)
Even thought the four seasons may change (Oh, yeah)
I see the sun when I hear your name
(I see the sun, it's in your eyes and I just know)
You give me a reason, a reason to start again
(Yeah yeah, a reason to start again) Oh, yeah, yeah
I said I love you, I love you, I love you
Oh, yes, I do, I truly love you
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah, hey, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh
I said now take me to the end for me
Yeah, hey, yeah, yeah
