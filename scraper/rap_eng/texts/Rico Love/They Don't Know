[Intro]
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
We be in the same room
We don't ever say shit
Let's keep it between me and you
And we cool, cause they don't know

[Verse 1]
I'm the one you be textin' when you be up at your job
I'm the one that brought that Benz that's in your garage
I'm the reason you don't stress when shit gets hard
And anything you want, it's all yours
They don't know
On your birthday I'm the one who saw your birthday suit
Got that Birkin bag and bought that birthday coupe
I keep it all real, I ain't gotta tell lies to you
You're the only one who knows the truth

[Hook]
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
We be in the same room
We don't ever say shit
Let's keep it between me and you
And we cool, cause they don't know

They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't even know I know you
You don't be talking like a lame bitch
You follow the rules, we keep it cool
Cause they don't...

[Verse 2]
We was at the same hotel, Super Bowl and All-Star week
You be acting shy but you're really an all star freak (They don't know)
That you got my name tattooed on your body
They don't know you belong to me, yeah (They don't know)
About the code names and the secret island trips
When I be up in that pussy I be callin' you my bitch
They don't know you like me, they don't know you like me
They don't even know that I share you with my wifey

[Hook]
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
We be in the same room
We don't ever say shit
Let's keep it between me and you
And we cool, cause they don't know

They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't even know I know you
You don't be talking like a lame bitch
You follow the rules, we keep it cool
Cause they don't...

[Verse 3]
You deserve the rewards, G5 planes, you deserve the board
Tell them all the lames, they can swerve of course
And I swear to God I'mma curve the broads
Cause they don't know, vacations they don't go
You stay patient and I respect that cause you know how to play your post
Them other bitches get antsy, that's why a nigga never treat 'em fancy
You get shoes off in Bergdorf while they bargain shopping on Delancey
You ain't even to your sister, Mama thinking you don't even like niggas
Instagram, you don't even like pictures, that's why I'm fuckin' with ya

[Hook]
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
We be in the same room
We don't ever say shit
Let's keep it between me and you
And we cool, cause they don't know

They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
They don't even know I know you
You don't be talking like a lame bitch
You follow the rules, we keep it cool
Cause they don't...
