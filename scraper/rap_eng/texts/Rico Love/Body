[Verse 1]
(Turn the lights on!)
Soakin' wet
She can't keep dry
I need it bad
Man, I tell no lie
Put both your hands
Upon the wall
Fling it up girl
I won't let you fall
Gotta front row seat
Bare as you dare
Put it on repeat
Why you do that girl
Getta little lower
Push on wine
She gon' feel my power
She gon' blow my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
5... 4... 3... 2...
1... Girl, time is up
I want to see all of your lighters up
Soon I'll spend all night tied up with her
All tied up with her
All tied up with her

[Chorus]
'Cause me love it when you push it up on me
Seh me love it when you twist up weh body on me
She know I can't resist when she on me
Seh me love it when you twist up weh body on me
