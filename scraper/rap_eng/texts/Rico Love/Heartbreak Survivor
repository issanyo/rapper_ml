I used to smile to hide all my pain
I used to laugh when I felt like crying
But now I'm smiling cause babe
I'm not worried, oh no
Not worried about you
I used to think you had so much game
Now it's like you don't even turn me on
And boy I'm no longer hurting, oh no no
Cause I'm a heartbreak survivor
Walked out of love without a scratch
No burns, no bruise, no scars I'm all intact
Cause I'm a heartbreak survivor
No I don't plan on turning back
Cause you'll never break my heart again like that
There were times I thought I'd go crazy
There were days I thought I'd lost it all
But I'd rather be alone than have anything
Have anything with you at all
I wasn't always the strongest girl
Didn't have the toughest skin
But I've been to a place called heartbreak
And I swore I'd never visit there again
Heartbreak survivor
Walked out of love without a scratch
No burns, no bruise, no scars I'm all intact
Cause I'm a heartbreak survivor
No I don't plan on turning back
Cause you'll never break my heart again like that
Now I get to watch that building burn down
No longer a casualty, I'm living now
Baby and one day I'll make it out somehow
Heartbreak survivor
I used to smile to hide all my pain
I used to laugh when I felt like crying
But now I'm smiling cause babe I'm not worried, oh no
Heartbreak survivor
Walked out of love without a scratch
No burns, no bruise, no scars I'm all intact
Cause I'm a heartbreak survivor
No I don't plan on turning back
Cause you'll never break my heart again like that
Heartbreak survivor...
