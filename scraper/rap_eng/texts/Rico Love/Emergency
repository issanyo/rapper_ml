[Verse 1]
Uh-oh I did it again
Just when I thought I couldn't fall no deeper
Somehow I bumped right into him
I guess the game of love is ready to begin
Another page added to the story
Feelings are hard to pretend
I thought my heart just couldn't get much weaker
But somehow it bruises breaks and bends
I want to hate him but he hits me with that grin
And now I'm back in love again nooo-u-woahhh

[Chorus]
Emergency I got this feeling
Emergency I need your healing me
So send rescue here for meeee
It's an emergency
Emergency I think I'm hopeless (hopeless)
Emergency I'm losing focus how could this thing happen to meeee
Ohhhh emergency

Can't get him out of my mind
I'm so infatuated with his swagger
His style is so one of a kind
I think of him and now wish I could press rewind
My hero's finally coming for me
I can't take rejection this time
My heart is still bleeding from the last dagger
I vowed to leave the pain behind
And baby love is like a mountain I can't climb
Just when I thought that I was fine no, call

[Chorus]
Emergency I got this feeling
Emergency I need your healing me
So send rescue hear for meeee
It's an emergency
Emergency I think I'm hopeless (hopeless)
Emergency I'm losing focus how could this thing happen to meeee
Ohhhh emergency

We both shared favorite orchids and watched vintage movies
Our signs are so compatible the chemistry is there
Ooowhoo but why am I so scared
I'ma call emergency baby yeah

[Chorus]
Emergency I got this feeling (I'ma bout to call them)
Emergency (because I think I've fallen yeahh yeah e yeah) I need your healing me
So send rescue hear for meeee
It's an emergency
Emergency I think I'm hopeless (hopeless)
Emergency I'm losing focus how could this thing happen to meeee
Ohhhh emergency
Ohhhh emergency
