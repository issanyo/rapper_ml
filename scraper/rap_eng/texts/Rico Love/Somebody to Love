[Verse 1: Leighton Meester]
Paris, France to Michigan
London town and through Berlin
Can't believe this place I'm in
Everywhere and back again
Porcelain and China dolls
Give me one and I've seen them all
Got my back against the wall
Wonder where I'll be tomorrow

[Pre-Chorus: Leighton Meester]
But wait, now how long could this take?
It's hard to find a mate when you're gone before he wakes
They say it's hard to achieve, but can a girl believe?

[Chorus: Leighton Meester & Robin Thicke]
Is there somebody who still believes in love?
I know you're out there
There's gotta be somebody
I searched around the world but
I can't seem to find somebody to love

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
Baby girl, there you at
Looking at me like a putty cat
Wondering where that thing is at
Wondering where your ring's at
Nobody ever did it quite like this
Nobody ever did it quite like you
Do your hair, I bought you shoes
We can hit the town like superstars do
You fall in love? Then let me show if you love
Give me the key to your heart, I can give you what you want
When you're waiting for love, you're looking for someone
Imma turn you wild right now into a woman

[Chorus: Leighton Meester & Robin Thicke]
Is there somebody who still believes in love?
I know you're out there (I know you're out there)
There's gotta be somebody
I searched around the world but
I can't seem to find somebody to love
Is there somebody who still believes in love?
I know you're out there (I know you're out there)
There's gotta be somebody
I searched around the world but
I can't seem to find somebody to love

[Bridge 1: Leighton Meester]
Je t'adore, je t'adore
Make a move, do the thing
Turn around, strike a pose
Je t'adore, je t'adore
Make a move, do the thing
Turn around, strike a pose

[Bridge 1: Leighton Meester & Robin Thicke]
Ooh, I like it
Ooh, I need it
Ooh, I want it
Hey, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Leighton Meester]
I know it's hard to achieve, but can a girl believe?

[Chorus: Leighton Meester & Robin Thicke]
Is there somebody who still believes in love?
I know you're out there
There's gotta be somebody
I searched around the world but
I can't seem to find somebody to love
Is there somebody who still believes in love?
I know you're out there
There's gotta be somebody
I searched around the world but
I can't seem to find somebody to love

[Outro: Leighton Meester]
(You say hello, I say goodbye)
