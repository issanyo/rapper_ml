[Verse 1]
The winters too cold, the summers too hot
The days too long, the bullshit don’t stop
The worlds gonna be here, whether you stay here or not
Oh no, I know
Ah, who knows where the road will take you?
Ah, just make sure you don’t let it break you, enjoy the ride
You don't get much time, so make it the time of your life
Cause I'm enjoying mine, cause I'm enjoying mine

[Hook]
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, turn the lights on
Ride, ride, ride, winter too cold, summer too hot
Winter too cold, summer too hot

[Verse 2]
The winters too cold, the summers too hot
And even if it all goes wrong, at least we gave it all we got
One day we gotta leave here, might as well leave here on top
Oh no, I know
Ah, who knows where the road will take you?
Ah, just make sure you don’t let it break you, enjoy the ride
You don't get much time, so make it the time of your life
Cause I'm enjoying mine, cause I'm enjoying mine

[Hook]
