[Verse 1]
If we can’t be happy, can we at least pretend
Even if you cannot love me, can you at least just tell me it
Ain't that what they all do anyway, yeah, they kiss each other on the face
They call each other bae, when deep down inside all they feel is pain

[Hook]
So we might as well get married cause ya so sick of me already
You want me to leave already, so hard to believe already, already, already
We might as well get married cause we’re arguing already
You hate my guts already, fell outta love already, already, might as well get married, turn the lights on

[Verse 2]
Lets smile at each other, so we can please our friends
Cause we both know just how much you care bout impressing them
Cause ain't that what couples do anyway, they lie right in each others face
And they call each other bae, when deep down inside all they feel is pain

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I buy you a house so you can kick me out
Take my ass to court and tell the judge what I'm 'bout
Don’t forget to tell the kids that they Daddy ain't shit
Look at how he did ya Momma out there with that outta bitch

[Outro]
Cause we’re arguing already
Fell outta love already, already, might as well get married
