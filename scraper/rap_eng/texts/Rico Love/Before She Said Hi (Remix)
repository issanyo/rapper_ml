[Verse One] [Mario]:
I'm sick and tired of friends with benefits
Been through too many goodbyes
And I can't say that I been so innocent
Cause I told my share of lies
But it seems like whenever I get closer
Love pushes me away
And just when I thought my chances were over
I stared my future in the face

[Hook] [Mario]:
I looked an angel in the eye
And since then I've been paralyzed
Something told me she'd be mine
And I knew it before she said hi (before she said hi)
Hi(hi)... hi(hi)
And I knew it before she said hi
Hi(hi)... hi(hi)
And I knew it before she said hi

[Verse Two] [Mario]:
I made a lot of broken promises
I had no respect for words
And I thought that I'd gotten all that I'm against
Until I ran into her
She whispers to me and it pulls me closer
Now I can't stay away (no I can't stay away)
And now I feel like all my pain is over
I stared my future in the face

[Hook]

[Verse Three] [B.O.B]:
Well, I used to be mellow
Until both her eyes connected like a metro
How you think you ain't special?
C'mon girl, you had me at, "Hello"
And so we started to kick it like a pedal
And in love we started to fall bel-low
I mean below
And as the story goes
I started doing shows
Eventually, I landed on the west coast
So I've been with the flow
And then I called your phone
So then we ended up runnin' around town like Goldy
Hypnotized with cinnamon eyes, I'm frozen
Back and forth we would go yo-yoing
And I'm hopin'
That you will see how I was feelin' wide open
And I'm not
And I'm not tryin' to be imposin'
But if it's you and me baby, I'm rollin'
Yeah!

[Hook]
