[Intro]
A-N-G-E-L
A-N-G-E-L

[Verse 1]
Just like a shadow
I'll be beside you
I'll be your comfort
I'm there to guide you, home
I will provide you a place of shelter
I wanna be your zone
I'll act as if you do
Tell me what you wanted me to do
I'll make you great to be a man
With a woman who can stand
With every promise given
Making vows to please her man

[Chorus:]
If I could be your angel (your angel, your angel)
Protect you from the pain (from the pain, oh)
I'll keep you safe from danger (from danger, from danger)
You'll never hurt again (no more)
I'll be your
A-N-G-E-L
Yeah, A-N-G-E-L
Hey
A-N-G-E-L
I'm gonna be your A-N-G-E-L
I'll be your angel

[Verse 2]
Just like the moon
I'll step beside
And let your sun shine
While I follow behind
'Cause baby, what ya got
It deserves all the props
You're everything I'm not
I'll act as if you do
Tell me what you wanted me to do
I'll make it great to be a man
With a woman who can stand
With every promise given
Making vows to please her man

[Chorus]
If I could be your angel (If I could be your angel, your angel)
Protect you from the pain (I will protect you from the pain, oh)
I'll keep you safe from danger (I'm gonna keep you safe from danger, from danger)
You'll never hurt again (you'll never hurt again)
I'll be your
A-N-G-E-L
Yeah, A-N-G-E-L
Hey
A-N-G-E-L
I'm gonna be, gonna be your A-N-G-E-L

[Verse 3]
Tell me why there's so many good men
Left in the world misunderstood
He's a dog, he's no good
I wish somebody would
Disrespect my man
You're gonna have to come see me
I work hard for my baby
He's all that I need

[Bridge]
So if you got a good one
Put your hands up
Come on girl and stand up
Go ahead lift your man up
Get up
If you got a good one, put your hands up
Go ahead lift your man up
Get up
If you got a good one, stand up
Come on girl, and stand up

[Chorus until Fade]
If I could be your angel (your angel, your angel)
Protect you from the pain (from the pain, oh)
I'll keep you safe from danger (I'll keep you sagefrom danger, from danger)
You'll never hurt again (no more)
I'll be your
A-N-G-E-L
A-N-G-E-L
I'm gonna be your A-N-G-E-L
A-N-G-E-L
I'll be your angel
