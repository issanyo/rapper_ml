Sometimes he calls me on the phone
Just to tell me he loves me
More than anyone else in the whole wide world
And when he gets me all alone
Oh, he kisses and he hugs me
And he lets me know that I'm his only girl
He works me like a full time job y'all
But I love it when he takes me there
He's so out of this world
It's hard to believe
That he loves a girl
And that girl is me

[Chorus:]
I am the luckiest girl, luckiest, girl
I feel so lucky right now
I am the luckiest girl

Look at what you doing
So high you stress them other birds-no
'Cuz I walk on the ceiling
His love is making me high
Anytime there's something wrong
He's got a special way of curing me

[Chorus:]
You so out of this world
It's so hard to believe
That he loves a girl
And that girl is me
I walk on the clouds
Tip toe on the sky
Somebody call the laws
'Cuz he just stole my heart

I am the luckiest girl
I feel so lucky right now
I am the luckiest girl
So high you can't bring me down
I am the luckiest girl
I feel so lucky right now
So high you can't bring me down
