[Hook: Rico Love]
You say you don't love me, I say of course you do
You say you don't love me, I say of course you do
Did everything I did because of you (Wheres the weed at?, where's the weed at?)
You say you don't love me, I say of course you do
Of course you do, I made it that way, I forced you to
You know this cold world, this cold world
They ain't got no remorse for you
You say you don't love me, I say of course you do
You say you don't love me, I say

[Verse 1: Giggs]
Can I start with sayin' rest in peace to my auntie?
Felt to say it because I missed her
I remember that day mad clearly
Mum just lost her big sister
The day my nan lost her daughter
I hate to paint out that picture
But
That's the day that God picked her
Lemon's the healer
I said that lemon's the cleaner
And I'm a heavy believer
There's hell in heaven's arena
I pray that heaven's received her
This for Jamel and Jamila
Streets don't love man
Man's givin' it the love, but the streets want a hard man
To the smooth or the rough
I hope police don't tug man
And when it booms and it bucks
I bet the streets won't mug man
I went through hell's arena
Shoulda been at home minding Mel and Selena
And John who's a lawyer
And Don who's a cleaner
Another three more for my man
Another ten more for Rita

[Hook: Rico Love]
You say you don't love me, I say of course you do
You say you don't love me, I say of course you do
Did everything I did because of you
You say you don't love me, I say of course you do
Of course you do, I made it that way, I forced you to
You know this cold world, this cold world
They ain't got no remorse for you
You say you don't love me, I say of course you do
You say you don't love me, I say of course you do

[Verse 2: Giggs]
You say of course you do
But who asked them niggas to call feds?
You say of course you do
But half my niggas are all dead
Course you do
But ask them niggas 'bout who bled
Now I've divorced the crew
You can ask them niggas 'bout who repped
Donny's enjoyin'
Man don't like that, so donny's annoyin'
Tried to get donny to boy him
Now it's all going off
Cause don brought the toy in
Of course you do, course you do, course you do
But armed up to the teeth
Lookin' like I bought a few
That's why I'm tryna talk to you
I got a son and now I've got a little daughter too
Course I do
I can't even blame them
Past mistakes
I can't even change them
I can't even name them
So more time with the nerds
I just can't entertain them

[Hook: Rico Love]
You say you don't love me, I say of course you do
You say you don't love me, I say of course you do
Did everything I did because of you
You say you don't love me, I say of course you do
Of course you do, I made it that way, I forced you to
You know this cold world, this cold world
They ain't got no remorse for you
You say you don't love me, I say of course you do
You say you don't love me, I say of course you do

Turn the lights on
Of course you do
