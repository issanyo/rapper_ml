[Intro]
What you feel like?
What you feel like?
What you feel like?
What you feel like?

[Verse 1: Sean Paul]
Love her back because she love me
Picture up in my cell phone
Call her up when I get lonely
Hope she keepin' her cell on
This girl, she got somethin' 'bout her I can’t deny, aye
This girl, if she tells me to I'll be standing by, aye

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Paul]
But, what you don’t know is
Once we get started, it'll go on and on

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sean Paul]
And it won’t stop 'til I see her love come down
And it won’t stop 'til I’m in too deep I’ll be lost in love, nowhere to be found
And it won’t stop 'til I hear her make that sound
Until she screaming out, "Baby, you’re 'bout to turn me out"
Oh no, we can’t stop now
I’m about to feel her body
Can't stop now
I’m about to feel her body
You're 'bout to turn me out
I’m about to feel her body
You're, you're, you're
I’m about to feel her body
You're 'bout to turn me out

[Verse 2: Sean Paul]
I’m about to feel her body
She’ll be takin' her clothes off
Once we get the gal right by me
Break her down 'til she doze off
This girl, should be up there with the stars in the sky, aye
This girl, she could send me on a permanent high, aye

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Paul]
But, what you don’t know is
Once we get started, it'll go on and on

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sean Paul]
And it won’t stop 'til I see her love come down
And it won’t stop 'til I’m in too deep I’ll be lost in love, nowhere to be found
And it won’t stop 'til I hear her make that sound
Until she screaming out, "Baby, you’re 'bout to turn me out"
Oh no, we can’t stop now
I’m about to feel her body
Can't stop now
I’m about to feel her body
You're 'bout to turn me out
I’m about to feel her body
You're, you're, you're
I’m about to feel her body
You're 'bout to turn me out

[Verse 3: Sean Paul]
Talked up on this, stepped up on this
Keep it real properly, I will never miss
You and I intwine and in a ever bliss
Me and her combined, she a reminisce
Tops up on this, give all the reminisce
See all the lonely nights, we got candy strips
I’m the landlord to the premises
I am the king, make her know what a empress is
Genie me give you sex wishes
Flex with me for the lifetime membership
So send her kids, make remember this
No matter day from my calendar is

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Paul]
But, what you don’t know is
Once we get started, it'll go on and on

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sean Paul]
And it won’t stop 'til I see her love come down
And it won’t stop 'til I’m in too deep I’ll be lost in love, nowhere to be found
And it won’t stop 'til I hear her make that sound
Until she screaming out, "Baby, you’re 'bout to turn me out"
Oh no, we can’t stop now
I’m about to feel her body
Can't stop now
I’m about to feel her body
You're 'bout to turn me out
I’m about to feel her body
You're, you're, you're
I’m about to feel her body
You're 'bout to turn me out
