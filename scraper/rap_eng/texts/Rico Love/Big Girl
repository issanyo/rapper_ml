[Chorus]
Don't say you in love
Don't say you in love
Don't say that you want me like I want you
(When I know that you don't)
Don't do me no favors
Oh, I'm a big girl I can handle it
Don't do me no favors
Oh, I'm a big girl I can handle it, handle it
Don't tell me you need me
Just tell me you leaving
I won't act like it's easy
Cause I'm a big girl, I'm a girl, (oh I can handle it)

[Verse 1]
And I never said that I won't cry my eyes
And I never said that I won't be breaking down
I know I make it look good but I'm going through it right now
But baby walk out I'm gon' let you
The truth it taste more better

[Pre-Chorus]
So gon' head and break my heart
I know what to do with all the pieces
Baby I can't play those cards
Soon I'll forget ya
I'll find someone better

[Turn the lights on - Rico Love]

[Chorus]
Don't say you in love
Don't say you in love
Don't say that you want me like I want you
(When I know that you don't)
Don't do me no favors
Oh, I'm a big girl I can handle it
Don't do me no favors
Oh, I'm a big girl I can handle it, handle it
Don't tell me you need me
Just tell me you leaving
I won't act like it's easy
But I'm a big girl, I'm a girl, (oh I can handle it)

[Verse 2]
And I never said that I might not wanna call you late night
Especially on Thursday cause you know that's date night
But you don't wanna play right
So Imma lay it down till daylight
Some how Imma make it
Imma just smile and take it

[Pre-Chorus]
So gon' head and break my heart
I know what to do with all the pieces
Baby I can't play those cards
Soon I'll forget ya
I'll find someone better

[Chorus]
Don't say you in love
Don't say you in love
Don't say that you want me like I want you
(When I know that you don't)
Don't do me no favors
Oh, I'm a big girl I can handle it
Don't do me no favors
Oh, I'm a big girl I can handle it, handle it
Don't tell me you need me
Just tell me you leaving
I won't act like it's easy
But I'm a big girl, I'm a girl, (oh I can handle it)

[Refrain/Outro]
And I never said that I won't cry my eyes
And I never said that I won't cry my eyes
And I never said that I won't cry my eyes
And I never said that I won't cry my eyes
