[Verse 1: Cassie]
I don't wanna scream
I don't even wanna tell you how good it is
Because if it's a dream
I'd only wake myself up
And baby I don't wanna ruin this
Honestly I was scared cause
I know you were prepared
And you knew what I was thinking
All my thoughts, all my cares

[Hook: Cassie]
Then we made love on the balcony
Right there, in New York City
I saw a tourist staring back at me
In Times Square, in New York City
And in that moment the city was all ours

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I said she sassy, she classy
Haircut like she Cassie
Why your voice so raspy
Oh I hope she nasty
Last night it was kush and Ciroc
Yeah Supafreak
Told 'em put it on my black card
Get a super suite
We could do it right now
Girl I don't give a fuck
Right here in the valet
We can do it in the truck
Legs on the dashboard
Yeah I got her balled up
Maybe it's the kush or the heat
But it's fogged up, gone

[Verse 3: Cassie]
Had a couple drinks
Lit a L it was perfect
Started enjoying the scenery
We couldn't help it
All things have their purpose
The wind it blew through my hair love
I was stunned by your stare
From the sight of you standing there love
I could walk, walk on air

[Hook: Cassie]
Then we made love on a balcony
Right there, in New York City
I saw a tourist staring back at me
In Times Square, in New York City
And in that moment the city was all ours

[Verse 4: Young Jeezy]
Starting up on the floor
Ended it up on a dresser
Baby girl name is Pam
Why I just called her Vanessa?
I'm on the balcony stylin'
I got her legs on the rail
I locked that thing out the frame
Like I just got out of jail
She said Young don't you quit
She said Young don't you stop
She said you happy to see me?
I said no girl that's my Glock
She said you're G to the heart
You just so stuck in your ways
I said girl what you mean?
Why you still got on your J's?
I said they just dropped today
So I'mma keep on my shoes
And you keep moaning like that
Then we gonna be on the news
I like bitches with money
She likes niggas with power
She said let's do it again
But this time in the shower, gone

[Hook: Cassie]
Then we made love on a balcony
Right there, in New York City
I saw a tourist staring back at me
In Times Square, in New York City
And in that moment the city was all ours
