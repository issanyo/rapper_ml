[Talk:]
Yea (yea) right (right) yea (yea) lets go
I know you use to being in control
And I kinda like a woman who stands out
But tonight I want you to let me

[Verse 1:]
If you let me get closer to you I promise I could read your mind
(I'll tell you everything you're thinkin right now)
Just let me take your clothes off you'll learn to love me in a matter of time (oh baby)
U don't have to work I got you

[Chorus:]
Let me just [2x]
Let me just turn you on
Let me just [2x]
I'll make my tongue spell your name
Let me just [2x]
Give you just what you want
If you let me just let me just oh oh oh
Just remain nice and calm
Let me just [2x]
Because you won't feel no pain
I promise not to disappoint
If you let me

I wanna kiss you right, touch you right, fuck you right
If you let me
I wanna hold you right touch you right all night...

[Verse 2:]
If you let me just kiss you lean back I'll run my fingers through your hair
(I'ma lay your body down then I'ma pick it back up)
Oh no this won't be an issue
I'll lay your body down if you ain't scared
U don't have to work I got you

[Chorus:]
Let me just [2x]
Let me just turn you on
Let me just [2x]
I'll make my tongue spell your name
Let me just [2x]
I'll give you just what you want oh
If you let me just let me just oh
Just remain nice and calm
Let me just [2x]
Because you won't feel no pain
I promise not to disappoint
If you let me

[Bridge:]
I came here to save you
Why don't you let LOVE take it's course
I'll give you everything you need...
If you just....

[Chorus:]
Let me just [2x]
