[Verse 1]
Ran off like, you just touchdown
With no hellos or no ones there
To greet you with a smile
Drivin' down the road, you're homeward bound
Yeah, but baby home is where the heart is
And that's what hurts the hardest
Who will warm up your pillow?
Who gone cook you your dinner and say
Damn I missed you babe

[Chorus]
Who's been lovin you?
Who's gonna hold your hand and kiss your face
Like I use to do? (oh baby)
Who's been lovin you?
Tell me who's been there to hold and comfort you?
Like I do, like I do, like I do
Been lovin' you
Like I do, like I do, like I do
Been lovin' you, like I do
Yeah Yeah Yeah

[Verse 2]
You spend your nights alone, your bed is cold
Your soul it aches, your heart it breaks
And no one even know
And it's like your at an all time low
Still got the pictures up and it's so tough
Tough to let it go
Who will warm up your pillow?
Who gone cook you youre dinner and say
Damn I missed you babe

[Chorus]
Who's been lovin you?
Who's gonna hold your hand and kiss your face
Like I use to do? (oh baby)
Who's been lovin you?
Tell me who's been there to hold and comfort you?
Like I do, like I do, like I do
Been lovin' you
Like I do, like I do, like I do
Been lovin' you, like I do

[Bridge]
Cause I can be the raindrops on your window
I can be right there when clouds are gone
Love to the rescue I'm your hero
Rest inside me, I'm gone keep you warm

[Chorus]
Who's been lovin you?
Who's gonna hold your hand and kiss your face
Like I use to do? (oh baby)
Who's been lovin you?
Tell me who's been there to hold and comfort you?
Like I do, like I do, like I do
Been lovin' you
Like I do, like I do, like I do
Been lovin' you, like I do
