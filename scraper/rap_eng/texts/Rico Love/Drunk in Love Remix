(Rico Love):
You've been drinking, I can tell
I know your body so well
'cause I got my eyes on you (Nana)
And now I feel compelled
To take off your Chanel
All of your pleasures I'll provide for you (nana)
(Turn the lights on)
So many places we can go
If you promise to keep it low
Daughter of a preacher but what we do he don't need to know
I'm known to get a little freaky, ? tho
And if she deep throat
Imma get her up out them Easter clothes
She said "Reek, I love your sex."
I said "sh, I love your neck."
Sippin' on some shit that I won't name cause they ain't cut no check
Mirrors in your bathroom, please don't turn those lights down
You just poke your ass out and let me lift up your nightgown
IPhones on airport mode, leave it at the beep
In my case it's Clearport mode, you know I'm far from cheap
Swervin' on these hoes, swer, swervin' on these hoes
My black Rolly on the dresser, your La Perla on the floor
When my ex called I said fuck dat bitch up early, on that dro
Early on that dro, I'm up early on that dro
Hebru Brantley's on the wall, so artistic when I be
So advanced the way I ball, I curve all the niggas you wanna meet
Fuck that VIP, she said she nineteen, I said lemme see ID
Then you can see my D, I go deep, but I'm not deep
Just security with me, just make sure that you're a freak
And I'll make sure you're satisfied, I'll make sure that we both skeet
On sight (woah, woah)
I give it to you on sight (woah)
All night (woah)
Turn the lights on
(swervin' on these hoes, swer, swervin' on these hoes)(x4)

[Plies]:
(Imma keep it real, real quick
This Plies by the way)

Imma keep it real, I want me something that I can raw
I don't want me no new pussy, I want me something I fucked before
Wanna pull it out that pussy, you look at it when I let it go
I can leave it on your stomach or on your ass just lemme know
If she suck that dick forreal, she make sure her lips ain't touch that hair
Hope your gag reflexes work, don't need you throwing up in here
I been drankin', I been smokin', you can smell it on my breath
If I gargle my mouth I ? that pussy to get rid of all that there
You like me drunk, I like you drunk, you like me hard, I like you soft
When you ride that dick you ? , the mess I love the most
How we fuckin', how we suckin', when we get done we order toast
Doggystyle, from the back, have your ass on all fours
A nigga text her, took him home(?), I texted him back tell him no she not
She already nutted like two times, I want her to get one mo' before she out
When that alcohol involved it make that shit feel like in love(?)
When the Remy(?) get in that pussy I make that shit feel like it's go

(woah)(swervin' on these hoes, swer, swervin' on these hoes x4)
