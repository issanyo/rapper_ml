This used to be a house
Until the walls came tumbling down
Now what we gon' do now
With both our feelings hurt
And words keep blurting out

And somehow we found a way
To turn love into hate
You can hear the bell ring for the final round
It's goin' down

This ain't love and this ain't human
This ain't real, so what the fuck is we doin'?
And this ain't life, there's much more to it
This whole situation is ruined

We trapped in and we can't get out
We can't get out, we can't get out
We trapped in and we can't get out
We can't get out, we can't get out

I used to have a heart
Now there's a hole inside my chest
'Cause we're so far apart, yeah
It's like we ain't the same people
I don't even see you the same, baby

And how we turned kissing into fighting
I don't know
And we got no umbrella for the rain

This ain't love and this ain't human
This ain't real, so what the fuck is we doin'?
And this ain't life, there's much more to it
This whole situation is ruined

We trapped in and we can't get out
We can't get out, we can't get out
We trapped in and we can't get out
We can't get out, we can't get out

Maybe this ain't love

This ain't love and this ain't human
This ain't real, so what the fuck is we doin'?
And this ain't life, there's much more to it
This whole situation is ruined

We trapped in and we can't get out
We can't get out, we can't get out
We trapped in and we can't get out
We can't get out, we can't get out

We trapped in and we can't
It's hard to break outta love with you
We trapped in and we can't
