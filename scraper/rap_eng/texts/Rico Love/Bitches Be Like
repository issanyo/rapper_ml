[Verse 1]
You were always the life of the party
But when you go and give yo life to somebody
It's like you find more pain than pleasure
You know you can't play that game forever
How long you gon carry on, carry on like this?
Different city every night still lookin for a nigga who gon wife it

[Chorus]
Bitches be like
Hair done, nails done
But I ain't got nowhere to stay
Bitches be like
Tonight I'm gonna kill em
Takin pictures with no filter
Bitches be like
Uh it's a lot of rich niggas in the club
I'mma make one of these niggas fall in love
Bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
Bitches be like

[Verse 2]
Uh, you've been tryna do it since â€˜92
That pussy sick now, you got vagina flu
Fuck you tryin to do? You ain't from DC
But you had the million man march up inside of you
Word to them rubbers in yo trash can
OGs and they younger brothers broke that ass in
Damn! These bitches be like
Poke my ass out and that's 150 likes
Rocked 150 mics
But only backstage, we just stayed for the night
No talent but she know Jimmy Fallon
No house, no car but she be stylin

[Chorus]
Bitches be like
Hair done, nails done
But I ain't got nowhere to stay
Bitches be like
Tonight I'm gonna kill em
Takin pictures with no filter
Bitches be like
Uh it's a lot of rich niggas in the club
I'mma make one of these niggas fall in love
Bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
Bitches be like

[Bridge]
But I know somewhere out there there's a nigga who loves you
These, these bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
Even though somewhere out there there's a lot of niggas who've worked you
These, these bitches be like
These, these bitches be like

[Verse 3]
Now I ain't judging, I just tell it how it is
You know what you do, you know what you did
You be takin trips, you won't be wit yo kid
They don't be wit you, they be at yo mama crib
While you just be getting flipped

[Chorus]
Bitches be like
Hair done, nails done
But I ain't got nowhere to stay
Bitches be like
Tonight I'm gonna kill em
Takin pictures with no filter
Bitches be like
Uh it's a lot of rich niggas in the club
I'mma make one of these niggas fall in love
Bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
Bitches be like
