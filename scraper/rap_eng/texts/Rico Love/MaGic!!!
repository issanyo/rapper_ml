[verse]
Baby, you could be the healer
You could be the cure
For what i'm feeling right now
Cuz right now
I need therapy
Baby, you could be the doctor
I'mma let you go to work
'cuz i know you can fix me somehow
You bring out
All the best of me

[b-section]
So i'mma trust you with my body and my mind
And anytime i am unsure, i'm sure you'll clarify
You just promise you'll just take your time
And take care of me

[hook]
What you do, with your hands, how you use em
Got me losing my brain, when you move em
And i hope, this ain't just an illusion
That abracadabra magic

[verse]
Baby, you could be the trainer
Go and do your thing
As long as you work it out
Don't go easy, please
Money given, a disclaimer
For my pleasure, you're the one to blame
I, fell so deep in lust, you accommodate my needs

[b-section]
So i'mma trust you with my body and my mind
And anytime i am unsure, i'm sure you'll clarify
You just promise you'll just take your time
And take care of me

[hook]
What you do, with your hands, how you use em
Got me losing my brain, when you move em
And i hope, this ain't just an illusion
That abracadabra magic
