[Verse 1]
You say I should leave, you don’t mean it
Say your done with me, you don’t mean it
Give you everythin’ girl, I mean it, I mean it
You say I should leave you don’t mean it
Say your done with me, you don’t mean it
I’ll give you everythin’ girl
Can’t explain how your lovin’ makes me weak
Can't explain how your lovin' makes me weak
I ain’t too proud to say it
I miss holdin’ your hands and I
Don’t think that I’m gone make it
Make it without you in my life
Look how all that ego trippin’ disappear when I fell in love
Every night a different woman, girl I swear it’s time to give it up


[Hook]
You say I should leave, you don’t mean it
Say your done with me, you don’t mean it
Give you everythin’ girl, I mean it, I mean it
Can’t explain how your lovin’ makes me weak
Can't explain how your lovin' makes me weak

[Verse 2]
Day dreamin’ bout you baby
Miss you, won’t rise the days goes by
Messed up, I feel so crazy
Promise I’ll never tell a lie (Try my best)
They don’t play this on the radio, I know
Still I’m gonna pour up my soul and you’ll hear it, I hope


[Hook]

Oh oh oh oh oh oooooooooh!
Oh oh oh oh oh oooooooooh!

[Talking]
Dive the day, somebody said to me
He Was like: Rico, I heard your album, it's  fire bro
But, but why you sound so weak on every records?
He said: Why you so emotional on every song?
And I say: You know what, I feel like the strongest thing a man could do
Is to allow himself to be weak, for somebody he love
And I know radio don’t play that type of shit
And I know people reject that type of talk, cause they so tuff
But I just wanna let you know
Being honest is the strong thing a man could be
Admitting when he’s wrong, that’s the greatest triumph
So if you going through a break up with your girl
And you don’t wanna sound weak, just play this song
I'll do it for you bro
Sometimes you can’t find the words, just put this record on
It’s for free, it’s a gift
But go get my album though, It’s called “Turn the lights on”
In stores now, yeah
