[Verse 1]
Can't keep running with no one to run to
Can't keep fooling yourself with lies in your head
Can't find someone cause you left somebody that you shouldn't never left
Don't you wish you never let me go?
You let me walk out of the front door

[Pre-Hook]
Don't you front
You found out that I'm the one you want
Ain't that a shame boy?
All I see is you're looking for someone just like me
Oh oh oh

[Hook]
Are you looking for a better love
Are you looking baby?
Are you looking for a better love
You'll never find another
Are you looking for a better love
Cause maybe
When you're looking for a better love
I'm the one that you be thinking of

[Verse 2]
Can't keep talking with nothing to talk about
Can't keep saying that it's all good baby when it's really not
Can't keep saying that you're up when everybody knows you're really down
Don't you wish you never let me go?
You let me walk out of the front door

[Pre-Hook]

[Verse 3: Rico Love]
Shawty looking for a better love
There's no way I'll find a better us
We should be together but
I always find a way of I'm messing up
Told you that I learned my lesson last time
But it's like I keep on stressing ya
Women and wine shouldn't be combined
With men who tend to read subliminal signs
They bend over and feed these criminal minds
Those feminine ways a weakness that I'm still
Tryna deal with on some real shit
I'm way past my limit but I still sip
Don't wanna drown, that's the reason that we build ships
But I'm sailing all alone on a guilt trip
Still you got a ill grip
On my heart, couldn't play my part so we had to part
And you was the realest
They saying “Rico, ain't you still rich?”
Yeah, but I'd trade it all for a little kiss

[Hook]
