[Intro: French Montana & Rico Love]
Yeah
It's that wave music
I told Rico, I said
I felt like the shit wasn't done 'til we got back to the..
To that motherfuckin' tsunami wave
Not the "han" but the "ha"
Yeah
Turn the lights on

[Pre-Chorus: French Montana & Rico Love]
Many men wanna fuck this bitches like 50 outta town
New goals
Many men wanna fuck this bitches like 50 outta town
New goals
Droptop bought that Bentley spent about 50 up and burn
Steak tastin' like pussy, pussy gon' get me everytime

[Chorus: French Montana & Rico Love]
I used to dream of fuckin' strippers now I do it mayne
Back then I couldn't even tip 'em now I do it mayne
Now I got new clothes got new goals, look I ain't even tryin'
I told her mayne, mayne tryna fuck this hoes like 50 outta town
New goals (han)
Wave, wave, wave, new goals
Wave, wave, wave, new goals
Wave, wave, wave, new goals
Wave, wave, wave, new goals
I said bitch I got new goals

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Skrrt, skrrt
Wait a minute (wait a minute, wait a minute)
Wait a minute, ayy, ayy
Those ain't Rolex, diamonds, homie where you get 'em?
I ain't got time even if she bought me ten Hublots
I lost my old bitch came back with ten of those
Montana, Montana (Montana)
Drop head old school bandana (bandana)
Floor seats with the Hawks, Atlanta
Yellow Rose no top like Amber, han
Come and ride this wave, come and ride this wave (wave)
Got a hundred chains on don't be throwin' shade

[Pre-Chorus: French Montana & Rico Love]
Many men wanna fuck this bitches like 50 outta town
New goals
Many men wanna fuck this bitches like 50 outta town
New goals
Droptop bought that Bentley spent about 50 up and burn
Steak tastin' like pussy, pussy gon' get me everytime

[Chorus: French Montana & Rico Love]
I used to dream of fuckin' strippers now I do it mayne
Back then I couldn't even tip 'em now I do it mayne
Now I got new clothes got new goals, look I ain't even tryin'
I told her mayne, mayne tryna fuck this hoes like 50 outta town
New goals (han)
Wave, wave, wave, new goals
Wave, wave, wave, new goals
Wave, wave, wave, new goals
Wave, wave, wave, new goals

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Ayy
Streets love us 'cause they seen us on the come up
We was on that Smack, Cocaine City in the corner
Bitches fuck then they run back to their cama, han
Cover boy but I ain't fuckin' undercover (skrrt, skrrt)
We was posted by Frank's, Tremont
Flip packs, buy everything we want (we want)
New shows, new clothes, new hoes, nigga
Money stack cop a new boat, nigga
Crib cost me about two show
Say fuck friends when they got the two-door
But you know, you know, you know, you know

[Pre-Chorus: French Montana & Rico Love]
Many men wanna fuck this bitches like 50 outta town
New goals
Many men wanna fuck this bitches like 50 outta town
