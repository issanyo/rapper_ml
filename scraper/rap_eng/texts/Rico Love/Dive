[Intro]
I know you think I'm afraid
To take a chance
And go to the deep end
Usher, baby
Turn the lights on

[Verse 1]
These waters can get a little busy
But I got experience
Don't mind trekking to the storm
Long as I know that you're here with me
Shedding all your innocence

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise, girl, I ain't afraid

[Chorus]
It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Loving makes you so wet
Your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met, I knew that I
That I knew I was ready, baby
To take that dive

[Verse 2]
Can't help it, no
I want you to feel me
Every little bit of me
I don't need a life saver
Baby, going deeper ain't gon' kill me
And I love the rush I get from it

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise, girl, I ain't afraid

[Chorus]
It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Loving makes you so wet
Your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met, I knew that I
That I knew I was ready, baby
To take that dive

[Bridge]
I'll be inside when the tides are rolling, baby
You'll be my place to hide, all night
I'm not afraid to try
And knew I don't mind playing in the rain
And I was hoping that I get to take that dive

[Chorus]
It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Loving makes you so wet
Your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met, I knew that I
That I knew I was ready, baby
To take that dive
