Oh yeah, yeah

[Chorus: PnB Rock & A Boogie]
Nigga you's a lame, you just stick around for fame
You spent 30 on ya chain

I could do that everyday
I just blew that shit on rings
Grab the 30 let it rain
That's all, that's all, that's all, that's all
That's all, that's all, that's all

Cause I just pulled up in a range
I spent 80 on a chain
You spent 30 nigga that's all

Verse 1: (PNB & A Boogie)
You spent 30 nigga that's all
Boy you better get ya racks up
I just pulled up in that range ya
I just had to drop them racks off
I drop the top on these fuck niggas
Had to show'em we don't fuck with them
All my niggas with the same shit
Tell them lil niggas back off
Tell them lil niggas to back off
Get off my dick and get ya racks up
Texting a tweet on the internet
All they really do is act tough
But they don't really want act dumb
I get money I can brag , huh

You'll get hit up nigga that's all
