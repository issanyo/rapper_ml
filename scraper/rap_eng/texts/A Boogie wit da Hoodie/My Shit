[Verse 1: Fabolous]
We on that Summertime Shootout 2 now
And I'm on D'usse number two now
All she know is level up got her in her bag now
Hating hoes never up so they throwin' jabs now
See that Rollie on her wrist now when she dab now
She could throw it in the bag now like she Fab now
Got her rollin' in the Benz like fuck a cab now
We pullin' up like, "Fuck it's at now"
We run it up, we don't run from tabs now
We fuck it up then go get it back now
Love when the baddies call me zaddy
All you bitches upset, call 'em maddys
Tell 'em we ain't lackin' ya we got the rattys
Got no time for no pop up by your baby daddy
But I see you on your slim thick with the fatty
Waist so small, stomach all flatty
Make up on fleek and the body tatted
When she pop it, make me wanna throw some money at it
And every time I grab it I say that's my shit
Then you put it on me Lil Mo and Ja shit
So down to earth still on some fly shit
This that BK, BX, NY shit
On a boy bye shit taking vacays now
You can catch us out in Vegas we be up in Drais now
In Miami doing LIV on Sundays now
Or in LA now, turning up in Playhouse
But every time you see us we be on some fly shit
Diamonds talking for me saying look at my shit
And we buying Ros√© on some NY shit
Fab and A-Boogie on some NY shit

[Interlude: A-Boogie]
In my bag now, in my bag now
What the fuck is that sound
What the fuck is that sound

[Verse 2: A-Boogie]
Brought the mac out, niggas sat down
I got shit I never had now, I could brag now
Got my bitch a Louis bag now, she could brag now
Bought my bitch a Birkin bag now, she a brat now
Now I'm sitting in the club, in a different bag now
Baby, when I pick it up, you gon' put that ass down
Tell 'em you don't give a fuck, baby spin that ass round
Tell the DJ turn it up, what the fuck is that sound
A-Boogie with the Hoodie, and it's always foreign
Yeah I know she like my style, them other niggas boring
When I pull up it go skrrt skrrt, that's a foreign
When I pull up on a red light, they don't want it
Yeah I came up from the mud, and my baby know that
Introduced her to my plug, now she think she all that
When I first hit her up, no she never wrote back
Then I saw her at the club, so I got up on that

[Chorus: A Boogie]
Now every time they play this song she say, "This is my shit"
See the flick on my wrist
And I know she know what's up, baby this is my shit
See the flick on my wrist

[Verse 3: A-Boogie]
They know that's my bitch, that's a fact and she stuck with me
When you in my section fill it up when my cup empty
I can't fuck with rats, that's a fact, that's a dub nigga
All about my F can't put water over blood nigga
Trust me it get ugly
If I wasn't getting money, would you still want me?
If I told you I was broke, would you start acting funny?
This is all I ever wanted, you can't take it from me

[Chorus: A Boogie]
Now every time they play this song she say, "This is my shit"
See the flick on my wrist
And I know she know what's up, baby this is my shit
See the flick on my wrist
