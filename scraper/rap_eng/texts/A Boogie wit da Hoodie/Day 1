[Intro]
Nobody taught me shit about my day one
Day one til that day come
Who'd ever thought it'd be my day one
Nobody taught me shit about my day one
Seen some shit that get you murked if you say some

[Verse 1]
It hurt to kill a nigga you love
And I know that she addicted to drugs
That's why she giving it up
Gang members and dealers was who she hang with
Me and all of my niggas was on that same shit
Fuck it, we busy been fucking on the same bitch
But we ain't never have no problems that was gang shit
All the promises we made bout how we can't switch
I just wanted to be rich instead of famous
I was trapping with them niggas that I stayed with
Feds watching, we was ducking them cases
Black hoodie tho, just to cover my face up
Niggas be bitches, they switch up and try to make up

Now she know she wrong, she alone in the canyon
Got caught up with hammers in the crib and some xans, yeah

Everybody wanna know the word, askin questions
Everbody wanna know the word bout a dead man
Everybody wanna catch him slipping, he a dead man
