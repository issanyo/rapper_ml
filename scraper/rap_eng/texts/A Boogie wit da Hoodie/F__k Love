Fuck love
Nigga what's love
Fuck love

Verse1

She let me come to her room
I decorated her walls, I had to go to the store
I wasn't fucking her raw
I'm looking at her face and she had a frown  on it
Before I made it to the door she went down on it
Do yah damn  thing you know you deserve it
I mean, after all think it was worth it
Throw that ass round in a circle like a circus..
You clowned on me on purpose
Now I'm drinkin codeine thinking old things
Feeling like a biker all I rock is Balmain
We used to fuck all night til the morning
You ain't have to worry bout them other bitches on me
On some G shit,  you lied in my fucking eyes that was weak shit
I feel like young LL on a remix, you took my heart I let you keep it
Now everything we been through it don't mean shit
You really got me fucked up jackin fuck love

Verse2]

I'm like damn , this is the way I am
I do it all just the feed my fam
Finally made a clean song they didn't think I can
Cause the radio won't even play my jam
It's like damn, this is the way I am, fuck love
That's the way I am
1k for a verse next year 5bands
Now, none of these rappers wanna shake my hand
It's like damn homie, i thought you would understand homie
Fuck happened to you, I got a buzz now I owe you favors
Once they see you gettin paper they turn to haters
