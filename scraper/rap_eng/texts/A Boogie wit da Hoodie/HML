[Verse 1: Melii]
Tell me what it's like in the night when I ain’t by your side
You could catch a vibe for some time, but she won't do you right
Baby, won't you come on by?
No surprise, you know I wanna change your life
Baby, I just need one night
Get a taste of paradise, things will fall in line

[Chorus: Melii & A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
I know you want me to throw it back on you
I been east side, love, baby, just come through
Hit my line, hit my line
Baby, we can bump and grind, bump and grind
Hit my line, hit my line
Baby, we can bump and grind, ease your mind

[Verse 2: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Yeah, baby, come on give me Mazi on some sloppy shit
I like how you look at me while your mouth on the dick
Baby, you know how I like all of that thottie shit
She let my seed drip off of her bottom lip
She know I would never go expose her
And whenever she with me, she turn her phone off
She match my fly, I see her all the time in Bergdorf
But I think you look way better with your clothes off
Gucci, Louis, Fendi sweaters come right out of Bergdorf
But I think you look way better with your clothes off
Long hair like you don’t care how you go, girl
Monclair for your winter jacket, fuck a Marmot
Dick up all in her (Ah)
She gonna eat me up, I'ma eat her up for dinner (Uh)
For a minute I was gon' wife it up, but I'm trippin' (Mm)
Too late, I got drugs in my system
I'm on another level
And I swear I could make you feel so special
Dick shaped like a banana, hit the g-spot, simple
You be in my dreams, and in my dreams I'm in you
Two thousand on jeans and you can be all in 'em

[Chorus: Melii & A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
I know you want me to throw it back on you
I been east side, love, baby, just come through
Hit my line, hit my line
Baby, we can bump and grind, bump and grind
Hit my line, hit my line
Baby, we can bump and grind, ease your mind

[Verse 3: Melii]
Come grip on my waist, wine pon me
Louis V scarf on my face like Saudi
You could be my daddy, I could be your thottie
Need a real bitch that gon’ ride with the Bonnie
Know you wanna feel up on my body, get me started
Animale, devorame, ain’t no talkin', baby, be about it
I’ma throw it back, bring it back once more
Know you like to front, then you back for more
Like oo-ah, oo-ah, what you wanna do-ah? Do-ah?
Wanna be for you, I'll do, anything you want tonight

[Chorus: Melii & A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
I know you want me to throw it back on you
I been east side, love, baby, just come through
Hit my line, hit my line
Baby, we can bump and grind, bump and grind
Hit my line, hit my line
Baby, we can bump and grind, ease your mind

[Outro: Melii & A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Hit my line, hit my line
Hit my line, hit my line
Hit my line, hit my line
Rvssian
Hit my, hit my line
