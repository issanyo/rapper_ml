[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Sex me, don't caress me
I'm good, I don't wanna be your bestie
She like, "Wet me like a jet-ski"
Beat her to it, I'ma do it if she let me, yeah
Get flee in a white tee
Two hundred on my neck, it get icy, yeah
You can't be my wifey, you're just like me
Sex me, don't caress me
I'm good, I don't wanna be your bestie
She like, "Wet me like a jet-ski"
Beat her to it, I'ma do it if she let me, uh
Get flee in a white tee
Two hundred on my neck, it get icy, uh
You can't be my wifey, you're just like me

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
You're just like me, you're just like me
No you can't be my wifey
Be my nothing, you're just like me
Ooh, yeah
No you can't be my bestie, you can't be my wifey
You can't be my nothing, you're just like me

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Tourin' on the top of the world
Blimp with your name on the top of the world
Patek Philippe, you can spray it with the syrup
Too true to the game to be fuckin' the clerk
Pull off, kick rocks, you can hear the Masi' skrrt (Skrrt)
I seen Rihanna and told her, "Make it work" (Work)
A Boogie was taught to murk off vert (Brrt)
Pablo, politics get left on shirts (Err)
Test me, we'll be wrestling
I be coming from the top, big boss thing
Met an East lil' fine ting
I be diggin' in her drawers while in Boston
And I told her to call me 'cause
I heard you was a stalker, I like stalking
Batter up, shawty bossy
Take a hit, you gon' end up in the nosebleed

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Sex me, don't caress me
I'm good, I don't wanna be your bestie
She like, "Wet me like a jet-ski"
Beat her to it, I'ma do it if she let me, yeah
Get flee in a white tee
Two hundred on my neck, it get icy, yeah
You can't be my wifey, you're just like me
Sex me, don't caress me
I'm good, I don't wanna be your bestie
She like, "Wet me like a jet-ski"
Beat her to it, I'ma do it if she let me, uh
Get flee in a white tee
Two hundred on my neck, it get icy, uh
You can't be my wifey, you're just like me

[Verse 2: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
You're just like me
Doin' thotty things like it's okay
When you're talkin' to me you say all the right things
But if you don't mean it then don't say it
Ooh, Gucci flip-flops with the right fragrance
Ooh, we can switch spots, I am not famous
But I got so much fuckin' money, I cannot fake it
And I got so much on my mind, I need a bae-cation
I got money on my mind, wish I knew how to make it
She keep playin' with the dick when she knew how to taste it
I got acres on my wrist but your neck is amazin'
And I don't wanna do you dirty, you know you my baby
And I would tell you anything 'cause I know you won't say shit
Half the niggas that I know is a thief or a gangster
Yeah, I grew up around the block, it get hot and they spray shit
I know I love you but don't stop me from gettin' this paper

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Sex me, don't caress me
I'm good, I don't wanna be your bestie
She like, "Wet me like a jet-ski"
Beat her to it, I'ma do it if she let me, yeah
Get flee in a white tee
Two hundred on my neck, it get icy, yeah
You can't be my wifey, you're just like me
Sex me, don't caress me
I'm good, I don't wanna be your bestie
She like, "Wet me like a jet-ski"
Beat her to it, I'ma do it if she let me, uh
Get flee in a white tee
Two hundred on my neck, it get icy, uh
You can't be my wifey, you're just like me
