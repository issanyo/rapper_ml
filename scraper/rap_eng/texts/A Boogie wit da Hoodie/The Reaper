[Intro]
I know you very afraid
The Atomix
Very afraid, very afraid
Dirt on my name, mmh
I know I make you afraid
Nigga, be very afraid
Tryna put dirt on my name
Tryna put dirt on my name
Big body whips everyday
I'm in the big body Mulsanne
I’m goin' right off the brain
I'm goin’ right off the brain

[Verse 1]
I'm going right off the brain, yeah, mmh
The way you be sayin' my name, yeah
You do Percocets, that's how I know that you crazy (Whoa)
But who am I to judge you? I'm on the same thing, yeah
I used to be on that back block
Right where everybody sold crack rock
Me and T-Flee catchin' mad top
From a skeezer, I don't need her
I need Benz, Bentleys, and Beamer
If you could take my bitch, keep her
It's Hoodie Season, I’m the reaper

[Chorus]
I know you very afraid
Nigga, be very afraid
Tryna throw dirt on my name
Wanna put me in the grave
Nigga just watch what you say
Nigga just watch what you sayin’
'Cause niggas get shot every day, ayy, but I ain’t afraid
Amen, I wanna pray to God, just in case we catch a break, mmh
I could draw a weapon on you, you can never trace, mmh
Scope got a beam on it, y'all can see the laser
And bros come before my hoes, yeah

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna ride with you, girl, I just wanna be your side nigga
Know you want a ride-or-die nigga, but it's never hoes over my niggas
Never hoes over my niggas, yeah, it’s never hoes over my niggas
Highbridge, 6-5 ,nigga
I swear, I'ma be this way until I motherfuckin' die, nigga
Ain't no need for me to lie to you
You say you riding, who you riding for?
When it's static, you don't go outside no more
Say you with the shits, but not for sure
Say you with the shits, but not for sure
I ain't never been this fly before
Christian Louboutins and Christian Diors, mmh
I used to never get paid (Paid)
I used to never get paid
Now I can't remember my name
All of these bitches be calling me bae
Now I got watches and chains
Feelin' like I just hopped out a lake
I put that Glock to your brain if you touch it
Even if it was a mistake

[Chorus]
I know you very afraid
Nigga, be very afraid
Tryna throw dirt on my name
Wanna put me in the grave
Nigga just watch what you say
Nigga just watch what you sayin'
'Cause niggas get shot every day, ayy, but I ain't afraid
Amen, I wanna pray to God, just in case we catch a prey, mmh
I could draw a weapon on you, you can never trace, mmh
Scope got a beam on it, y'all can see the laser
And bros come before my hoes, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, bros come before my hoes
Mmh, before my hoes
Yeah, you know I'm on, on, on
