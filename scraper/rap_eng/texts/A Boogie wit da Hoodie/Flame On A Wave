[Intro]
City on a wave
Got the flame on a wave
Flame sitting on a wave now

[Verse 1]
Put the city on a wave
Told my youngen it's okay
We gon' make it any day now
Told my momma it's okay
Imma make it any day now
Top down in the Jag
Got a half a brick in that bag
I'm plucked and I don't brag
Put the pedal down on that gas
I was thinking bout the past
And I couldn't help but laugh
Cus' everything is all bad
Lonely nights in that trap
Tryna' hit a lick with no mask
Anything for that cash
Never slow, gotta get it fast
On road I pray I don't crash
On road I pray I don't crash now
Always watching my back now
Lot of knives in my back now
Let a nigga know I won't back down
Put the city on a wave
Told my youngen it's okay
We gon' make it any day now
Lot of niggas wanna hate now
But I ain't even really phased now
Lot of shit on my plate now
Gotta figure everything out
I was trappin' down at the driveway
Stole from niggas cus crime pays
Poppin' bottles on Friday
Put a nigga on the highway
Be one and look at me sideways
Everyday I go hard
I treat this shit like a job
I'm tryna' live like a star
So, everyday I thank God

[Chorus]
Put the city on a wave
Put the flame on a wave
Flame sitting on a wave now
Ain't shit you could say now

[Verse 2]
Coming off from the bando
Pulling strings like a banjo
Pushing keys like a piano
This the only life that I know
Making bitches hit a fucking high note
They watching me like a channel
Be lit as shit like a candle
I've been wanting so I gotta make it
They told me wait, be patient
Need a hundred stacks out in vegas
Just to put the flame on a wave
Last night I hit a ten
Same night I hit her friend
And we prolly' won't speak again
Coming out from the cold
Lot of bitches turned hoes
Lot of niggas turned foes
Now I gotta stay ten toes down
Anything can go down
I'm just tryna' put the city on a wave
Until we up on the coast to the coast
If anybody wanna threaten then you know I gotta go and get them roast
I could do it in a millisecond
Ain't no time wasting this the life I chose
I know that I might still be grinding
But my city is always behind me
I'm waiting for the right timing
Imma' thank 'em when I win a Grammy
Fly my mom to Miami
Fuck it I'm moving to Cali
Just to put the flame on a wave
I'm barely outside these days
Got me feeling like I live in a cave
I ain't tryna' go back to the old me
Don't make me go back to my ways
Recording recording recording
All that other shit ain't important
I'm just stacking up, rob a boarding
Just to put the city on a wave

[Chorus]
Put the city on a wave
Put the flame on a wave
Flame sitting on a wave
Flame sitting on a wave
