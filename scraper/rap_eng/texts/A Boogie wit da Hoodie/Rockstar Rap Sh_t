[Intro]
Rockstar rap shit, Rockstar rap shit (yeah, yeah)
We 'bout action, we gon' clap shit (yeah, yeah)
Rockstar rap shit, Rockstar rap shit (yeah, yeah)
Rockstar savage, ain't no lackin' (yeah, yeah)

[Verse - Ra Thottie]
Mad lit for the gang, couple cases in the fridge
Couple n*ggas did a bid, so I lost a couple friends
They just talk about the kid, but they don't ever get it in
They don't know about the story but they'll know about the glory
A little chubby but I'm lit, I could tell you 'bout a lick
But I won't tell you what I did, but I could tell you 'bout some shit
I could talk you 'bout risk, I could tell you 'bout this
I could tell you 'bout that, but I'd rather be rich
Mad rich, mad rich, rockstar rap shit, (Yeah bitch!)
Bad bitch, bad bitch, made in plastic,  (Yeah!)
Flippin packs just like gymnastics, (Yeah!)
Jump in the crowd like an acrobatic (Yeah!)

[Chorus - A Boogie]
Rockstar rap shit, Rockstar rap shit (yeah, yeah)
We 'bout action, we gon' clap shit (yeah, yeah)
Rockstar rap shit, Rockstar rap shit (yeah, yeah)
Rockstar savage, ain't no lackin' (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2 - A Boogie]
Don't get caught in traffic, get the automatic, (yeah, yeah)
Go and get your ratchet, my bitch so dramatic, (yeah, yeah)
Rockstar rap shit, Rockstar rap shit, (yeah)
Rockstar rap shit, Rockstar rap shit, (yeah)
Diamonds on me dancing, water on the Patek, (uh)
She overreactin', threw up on the mattress, (uh)
I be sick of rappin', bitch I feel like trappin', (uh)
I'm so into fashion, thousands on my glasses, (uh)
I put up a thousand, I can make your bitch say oh yeah
My wrist cost a house and I've been gettin' money all year
Zippers on my jacket lookin' like a biker bar, (yeah)
Pick up all the fly shit every time I hit the mall, (yeah)
On the road I wish I can be on tour all year
But I fell in love with Melody when she was born, (yeah)
I'm so lit they takin' pictures with me in the stores, (yeah)
Paparazzi on me taking pictures of my car (yeah)

[Outro - A Boogie]
Rockstar rap shit, Rockstar rap shit (yeah, yeah)
We 'bout action, we gon' clap shit (yeah, yeah)
Rockstar rap shit, Rockstar rap shit (yeah, yeah)
Rockstar savage, ain't no lackin' (yeah, yeah)
Don't get caught in traffic, get the automatic, (yeah, yeah)
Go and get your ratchet, my bitch so dramatic, (yeah, yeah)
Rockstar rap shit, Rockstar rap shit, (yeah)
Rockstar rap shit, Rockstar rap shit, (yeah)
