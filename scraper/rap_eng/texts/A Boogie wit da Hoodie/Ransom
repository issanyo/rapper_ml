[Intro]
A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, damn you be flexing
They want you for ransom

[Chorus]
It's a whole lotta ways I can get my cash up
Nigga you ain't got no back up, you should back up
All the hoes say I'm handsome, I got my bands up
I got bands, now my head up for a ransom
It's a whole lotta ways I can get my cash up
Nigga you ain't got no back up, you should back up
All the hoes say I'm handsome, I got my bands up
I got bands, now my head up for a ransom
Nigga I ain't put no cash up but it's back up
I just stay with my head up and my grass cut
Them snakes got me fed up, I need a hand gun
I got bands now my head up for a ransom

[Verse 1]
Damn son what's the issue?
Young nigga with a chip tooth and a pistol
I got into the money, started hitting licks too
100 bands make your mans turn right against you
Run through the money, run through the money
Yeah, I like Saint Laurent so I bought a bunch of it nigga
I like throwing one's so I threw a bunch of 'em nigga
I'm making this song just to keep it 100 nigga
Now I'm going up, niggas got their hands out nigga
You wasn't around now you my mans now
Probably want to get me clapped now, you a damn clown
Now you wanna give me dap, now you a fan now

[Chorus]
It's a whole lotta ways I can get my cash up
Nigga you ain't got no back up, you should back up
All the hoes say I'm handsome, I got my bands up
I got bands, now my head up for a ransom
Nigga I ain't put no cash up but it's back up
I just stay with my head up and my grass cut
Them snakes got me fed up, I need a hand gun
I got bands now my head up for a ransom

[Verse 2]
I fuck it up, thumb through a check, thumb through a check
My nigga UE shooting guard dumb with the left
RJ he a referee, he gon' get the Tec
I'ma keep scoring from 3, I ain't missing yet
Listen up, if I feel a threat, I'ma hit you up
Gripped it up, chain never tucked, I don't give a fuck
When she suck she gon' lick me up
Ain't no hickeys girl just hit me up
When you wanna fuck girl just hit me up
Stickied up and I got that drink when I drive by
Stick it up, taking everything when we drive by
Moving like Christina Aguilera, Lady Gaga
Another one, na-na-na-na-na-na

[Chorus]
It's a whole lotta ways I can get my cash up
Nigga you ain't got no back up, you should back up
All the hoes say I'm handsome, I got my bands up
I got bands, now my head up for a ransom
Nigga I ain't put no cash up but it's back up
I just stay with my head up and my grass cut
Them snakes got me fed up, I need a hand gun
I got bands now my head up for a ransom
