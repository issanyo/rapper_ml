[Intro]
She said, "Okay, okay, let's start over"

[Chorus]
Diamonds be the coldest when they all chokers
I'm paranoid, my hand on the toaster
Everybody duck before they start shooting
Fuck around, get hit, it's gon' be all over
She ain't wanna step into my fucking room
Fuck around and made a bed out the sofa
She said, "Okay, okay, let's start over"
Told me how she feel and now she all open

[Verse 1]
Now she all open, water from the pussy overflowing
'Fore I started stroking, eat it up, her legs on my shoulders
Now I'm so focused, yeah yeah, I swear I'm so focused
Yeah yeah, I swear I'm so focused
Everywhere I go they ask me where I'm going, I don't know you
You actin' like you know me, you don't know me so don't call me bro
If I take your hoe don't you trip she might not be a hoe
I'm just a man, I know I'm just a GOAT, I'm just an animal
If I stop fucking with bitches, can we start over?
If I post all of your pictures, can we start over?
If I tell you why I love you, can we start over?
I never meant to leave you heartbroken
If I admit it can we start over
Told you I'm an animal, I was a dog on you
You said I was different but I showed you wrong, don't I?
I still make you wet the bottom of your dome, don't I?
You told me that you don't care, I know you care don't lie
When I hit it from the back you be so scared, don't lie
Pull your hair and I bet I could break the bed on it
The way she gripping on the dick, she broke a nail on it
In and out the lobby, had the scale on me
Tissue on the camera so the super couldn't tell on me
Couple niggas wasn't real, they switched sides on me
You told me you was my nigga, but you lied to me

[Chorus]
Diamonds be the coldest when they all chokers
I'm paranoid, my hand on the toaster
Everybody duck before they start shooting
Fuck around, get hit, it's gon' be all over
She ain't wanna step into my fucking room
Fuck around and made a bed out the sofa
She said, "Okay, okay, let's start over"
Told me how she feel and now she all open

[Verse 2]
I was about to go and buy her ass a new ring
But instead I spent a hundred on a new chain
I was about to go and scoop her in a Mulsanne
But she talk about it every time that we do things
Mood swings, you killing me with all these mood swings
Don't you know I'm in my zone I'm in my 2-3
Shout out to my nigga Reggie for these two 3s
I swear my life is like a mother fucking movie
Two cribs, one for me and gang, one for you and me
Two chains, like I'm Tittyboi and they glittery
You a lame to her, now she wanna be my boo thing
Keep the same niggas with me, I don't need a new gang
If they hate, fuck it I expect a hater to hate
I can't let a hater be my friend that man is two-faced
Keep the 'K with me, yeah I only keep security
The place safe nigga I don't wanna be on TMZ

[Chorus]
Diamonds be the coldest when they all chokers
I'm paranoid, my hand on the toaster
Everybody duck before they start shooting
Fuck around, get hit, it's gon' be all over
She ain't wanna step into my fucking room
Fuck around and made a bed out the sofa
She said, "Okay, okay, let's start over"
Told me how she feel and now she all open
