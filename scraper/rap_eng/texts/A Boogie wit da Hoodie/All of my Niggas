[Intro]
Fuck the other side
I'm screaming fuck the other side
If my niggas tell me get em
Imma ride
Fuck the other side
I'm screaming fuck the other side
If my niggas tell me get em
Imma ride

[Hook]
Don't dare try to front on my niggas
Cause I came here with all of my niggas
Murder scene, won't leave it clean
Dirty guns on all of my niggas
Itchy fingers they poppin' them triggers
Won't hesitate imma pop me a nigga
Bullets rain blood stain cause I came, I came...

I came here with all of my niggas
Imma stay here with all of my niggas
If they try to front on my niggas
Blood stains on the front of my denims
Fuck them niggas
I don't fuck with them niggas
Fuck them niggas
I don't fuck with them niggas
Tell my hitta if he want em go get em cause I came, I came...

[Verse1: A Boogie]
I came here with all of my niggas
Fuck all that bragging
And talking about what we had
Cause my nigga we came here with nothing
Just wait till I get in my bag
Imma stunt on you bitches that frontin
And you can't tell me nothin
Got a crip nigga with me I call him cuzzin
My blood nigga with me I call him buzzin
They fuck with me and they bussin for nothin
They fuck with me that's the end of discussion
Shout out to all of my ocks
They tell me assalamu alaikum (assalamu alaikum)
Shout out to niggas that's loyal
Fuck all you niggas that's not
Fuck all the nights we were starving like Marvin
My nigga 13 and he movin that hard
And like he on the rockets
Don't know that he got it but he only 13
I told him to stop it my young niggas wildin
All about money and violence
Nigga I'm just being honest, they wanna line us
Already know where to find us
Told my nigga that I got us, my nigga I promise
I keep on killing this shit can you give me a moment of silence...
Damn I can't believe they killed my nigga Quado
When I die bury me in Ferragamo
But I won't let them catch me though
I'm screaming hollows
But if I gotta go make sure them niggas follow

[Hook: Artist Martin Mcfly & A Boogie]

[Verse 2: Martin Mcfly]
I came here with all of my niggas... and all of my niggas ride
We don't take no disrespect man
They gon hit you if you try, Plus we down for whatever
We ain't letting nothing slide, we gon get you on a issue magazines on all our sides
If you run we hit your back
Where you front is where you die
Quarterback this gat, and we letting bullets fly
Yo homies pourin beer in front the church yo momma cry
My niggas with it don't do prison
Hit a witness in his eye (Bang)
But the streets ain't the same gotta change routes
Gotta show a nigga what your aim about
Real niggas in trouble cause we live in the jungle
Where snakes and rats can hang out... man
Its really getting strange out, trust easy something you can do
Keep your gun cocked and your eyes too
Can't even look at niggas the same now
Watch hoes don'tâ€‹ be a fool
Your day ones and day twos
Keep your circle small, gotta watch your crew
Cause your barber not the only one lining you
I'm just glad that all my niggas loyal
Been taught to stay 100
From the cradle to the soil, fa real

[Outro]
Fuck the other side
I'm screaming fuck the other side
If my niggas tell me get em
Imma ride
Fuck the other side
I'm screaming fuck the other side
If my niggas tell me get em
Imma ride
