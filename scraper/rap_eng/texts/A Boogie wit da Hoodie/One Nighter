[Chorus: YFN Lucci & A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
She was just a one nighter
I put her in a luxury and now she think I like her
She tried to flex but luckily already no one like her
She told her friends about the dick, she said she think I like her, ah
I know she get around
She never told me what her name was but I read about it
Ain't gotta tell you what my name is, bitch you heard about me
She think it's this, she think I like her, now she worrying about me, ah
She was just a one nighter
I put her in a luxury and now she think I like her
She tried to flex but luckily already no one like her
She told her friends about the dick, she said she think I like her, ah
I know she get around
She never told me what her name was but I read about it
Ain't gotta tell you what my name is, bitch you heard about me
She think it's this, she think I like her, now she worrying about me, ah

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
Get money, fuck bitches for fun
Then we back to the funds, back to square one
Keep them squares out my circle, I ain't never been one
I done fucked a lot of hoes and I ain't never cuffed one
Yeah, I mean girl, you can't fuck just one
Got the gang outside, let 'em know when you done
Then run and tell your friends how we get down where we from
We just a young, fly, flashy, young nigga, we gone
Okay lil' bih, A Boogie got your bitch going dumb
You know we don't chase bitches, can't be lovin' them son
I got ya bitch eatin' dick, I make her swallow the cum
I heard you fell in love with her but that bitch ain't the one
I gotta make her think I like her, I gotta fuck the bitch good like I like her
And even if I like her, I can't be no lifeguard
Save her for that other boy, this a one nighter

[Chorus: YFN Lucci & A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
She was just a one nighter
I put her in a luxury and now she think I like her
She tried to flex but luckily already no one like her
She told her friends about the dick, she said she think I like her, ah
I know she get around
She never told me what her name was but I read about it
Ain't gotta tell you what my name is, bitch you heard about me
She think it's this, she think I like her, now she worrying about me, ah

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Put her on Dom PÃ©rignon when she take it off
Had to take a loss, came up and became a boss
Bitches killed my bro, you eat how the shit get off
Sleepin' with my pole, be careful 'fore you wake me up
You wanna spend a day wit' me, you can't hang wit' me
Everywhere I go my gang wit' me, Lucci hang wit' me
You might end up in a maze wit' me, tryna stay wit' me
Never try to play no games wit' me, play no games wit' me, ah
Knew she was up to something
She tried to put me on her Snap, I told her, "Bitch, you buggin'"
I'm not just anybody, you can't take a picture of me
Fuck around and post it up, you might get rich or something, ah
Don't get too excited
I could tell what's on your mind before you get to typin'
I could paint a picture of it, girl I'm good at writin'
Understand, I'm not your man, I'm just a over nighter, ah

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & YFN Lucci]
She was just a one nighter
I put her in a luxury and now she think I like her (Uh Huhh)
She tried to flex but luckily already no one like her (Yeah, yeah yeahhh)
She told her friends about the dick (Mmmm), she said she think I like her (Uh, uh uhhh)
I know she get around (Get around)
She never told me what her name was but I read about it (Yeah, I read about it)
Ain't gotta tell you what my name is, bitch you heard about me (I know you heard about it)
She think it's this, she like I like her, now she worrying about me, ah

[Outro: YFN Lucci]
Oh

Yeah, I know she think I like her
Yeah, I already met one like her, yeah
