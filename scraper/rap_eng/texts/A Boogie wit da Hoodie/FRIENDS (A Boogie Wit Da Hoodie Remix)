[Intro: Anne-Marie & A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Ooooh-oh, ooooh-woh (ya, ya, yeah)
Ooooh-oh, ooooh-woh

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
So many pretty girls in the world, but I wish that they was all like you
You can be my girlfriend or my friend, either way you gon' fall right through
Love to party, young nigga in a 'Rari, sorry I ain't ever sorry, got juice
Dolce & Gabbana it ain't tricky if you got it, if you want we can go to Jimmy Choo
You got me messed up I probably got every damn Balmain in my dresser
The way she go down, no hands, like a Tesla
She gon' breath out, breathe in, when I touch her
Airplane mode on your phone when I fuck ya
She gon' let me know what's the bin, I'm a hustler
Moncler clothes when it's cold, I'mma bless ya
She ain't even got to sneak out, I'mma let her
It ain't no pressure

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Haven't I made it obvious?
Haven't I made it clear?
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
Haven't I made it obvious?
Haven't I made it clear?
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
F-R-I-E-N-D-S

[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
Have you got no shame? You looking insane
Turning up at my door
It's two in the morning, the rain is pouring
Haven't we been here before?

[Refrain: Anne-Marie]
Don't mess it up, talking that shit
Only gonna push me away, that's it!
Have you got no shame? You looking insane
Here we go again

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
So don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going away without a fight
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite
I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Haven't I made it obvious? (Haven't I made it?)
Haven't I made it clear? (Haven't I made it clear?)
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
Haven't I made it obvious? (ooh)
Haven't I made it clear? (I swear I...)
Want me to spell it out for you? (to spell it out for you?)
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
F-R-I-E-N-D-S

[Bridge: Anne-Marie]
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
That's how you f****** spell "friends"
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
Get that shit inside your head
No, no, yeah, uh, ahh
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
We're just friends

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
So don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going nowhere without a fight
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite
I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Haven't I made it obvious? (Have I not made it obvious?)
Haven't I made it clear? (Yeah, I made it very clear)
Want me to spell it out for you? (Yo)
F-R-I-E-N-D-S (I said F-R-I-E-N-D-S)
Haven't I made it obvious? (I made it very obvious)
Haven't I made it clear? (I made it very clear)
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
F-R-I-E-N-D-S

[Outro: Anne-Marie]
Mmm, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah-oh, ah-oh
