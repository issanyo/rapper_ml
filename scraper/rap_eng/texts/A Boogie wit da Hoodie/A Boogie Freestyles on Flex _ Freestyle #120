[Verse]
I woke up to like ninety-nine missed calls
That's like ninety-nine people I probably pissed off
Like damn, nigga, I was on a jail call
Damn, niggas make me hate my cell phone
Like damn, my nigga, I'm in the studio
Last time I dropped an album was like a year ago
Yeah, you tellin' me you starving, but I been to there
Like growin' up, breakfast, lunch and dinner wasn't cereal
I know what's up
You just wanna be all in the videos and smoke it up
I know you ain't really with the shits but you just throw it up
Pretty bitches in my city litty, they just going up
Nigga, you just wanna be around me 'cause my money up
I heard them goofy niggas tryna line me, they don't want smoke with us
Had to pop an Addy, I was down, yeah, had to focus up
Most my niggas dogs, I hit up bitches that my homies fucked
I hear too much me in niggas' songs, so I had to switch it up, I had to switch it up
I pick out diamonds in particular 'cause I'm just rich as fuck
Rest in peace to that boy Trayvon, I got my hoodie up
We know exactly how we give it up, shot a bully up
And you bitches know that I cannot waste no time
Bitch, I'm really grindin'
If I ever said, "I love you", never mind it
Especially when I feel like you out here thottin'
I threaten you, but I fuck with you, let's be honest
I hide the fact that I love to smoke on exotic
Flowers, I give you all my hours
I fuck around, I miss you though, I promise
Bonnie and Clyde issues, guns around
No bozos in my circle, they get cut
We can't even get around, I got my hoodie on in public
House arrest in Florida, they always checked up on me
So when I was in the studio I said I was in Publix
If you could walk in my shoes, you could walk on water
Percocets like NyQuil, got my buying sawed-offs
Since I been in high school, I been feeling heartless
I swear I was like you, now look at me ballin'
10K on one fit, fly like I departed
Stay with that rocket, ooh, I go J. Harden
Can't tell if I got it, but I stay on it
And they stay frontin', but it ain't nothin'
'Cause I make money, talkin' big money
Mmh, if I go broke, stay away from me
Mmh, if I go broke, I'ma take money, yeah
I might go broke in my late hundreds
It's hard not to talk money 'cause I got money now
And these chains around my neck over two hundred thou
And Puma just gave me a budget, I should say, "Fuck it"
And give it to the schools 'cause they need it more than I need it now
I swear I paid my dues, I should speak up more though, I'm playin' quiet
Tryna keep it cool like the time I was in the studio with Future in the room
Sittin' next to my favorite rapper, actin' scared to say it to him
Used to bump "March Madness," poppin' Addys because of you
After you and Drizzy dropped, then I got in tune (Yeah)
Drizzy, that's my broski, I appreciate you too, yeah
First time in the Garden, it was all because of you, yeah
I probably was OD-in' to do a song but I was new, yeah
I can't lie, oh, you was like my idol, ask my crew, yeah
Right when I thought viral was viral, Tekashi blew, yeah
And that's my nigga too, I fuck with you, I swear to God
Type of nigga keep that shit a hundred, cameras off
And I'm the type of nigga you might see in Saint Laurent
Different places, Cleveland, Miami, but I ain't LeBron
With different bitches, denims lookin' like they painted on
Listenin' to "D.T.B", yeah, that's our favorite song
Yeah, I don't trust bitches
Bitches just like me, that's why I don't trust bitches
This your favorite song
I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, DTB, no, I don't trust bitches
This your favorite song
When you're home, all alone
Reminiscin' my Dior cologne
No going back, I really took your soul
I know, yeah
I woke up with the chills, oh, oh
Took a pill with my milk, oh, oh
Like it's not a big deal, oh, oh
Free all of my bros, whoa, oh
Free my nigga PeeWee, free my nigga Skills, now
Man, you gotta see me, see how I came up now
Used to wear the same shit, I ain't lookin' like no bum now
I'm a New York nigga, hangin' laces off my Uptowns
Grew up in the jungle where they rumblin' for dust now
Runnin' 'round the BX, RIP to Big Pun, now
Look, I said RIP to Big Pun
And I don't know why
I swear these niggas wanna take my life
And it's so hard
I feel like they wanna take my life
