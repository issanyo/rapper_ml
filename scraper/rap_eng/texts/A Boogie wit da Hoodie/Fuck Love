[Intro- A Boogie]
Fuck love
Nigga what's love?
Fuck love
My nigga (Na Na na Na nah)

[Verse 1- A Boogie]
She let me come to her room I decorated her walls
I had to go to the store I wasn't fucking her raw
I'm looking at her face and she had a frown on it
Before I made it to the door she went down on it
Do your damn thing, you know you deserve it
I mean, after all think it was worth it
Throw that ass round in a circle like a circus
You clowned on me on purpose
Now I'm drinking codeine thinking old things
Feeling like a biker all I rock is Balmains
We Used to fuck all night til' the morning
You ain't have to worry about them other bitches on me
On some G shit, you lied in my fucking eyes
That was weak shit
I feel like young LL on the remix
You took my heart, I let you keep it
Now everything we beenthrough
It don't mean shit

[Chorus- A Boogie]
You really got me fucked up
Jacking fuck love
Fuck love
Nigga, what's love?
Jacking fuck love
(Na na Na nah nah Na)

[Verse 2- A Boogie]
I'm like damn, this is the way I am
I do it all just to feed my fam'
Finally made a clean song they didn't think I can
Cuz' the radio won't even play my jam
It's like damn, this is the way I am
Fuck love, that's the way I am
1K for a verse, next year 5 bands
Now none of these rappers wanna shake my hand
It's like damn homie
I thought you would understand homie
Fuck happened to you
I got a buzz now I owe you favors
Once they see you getting paper
They turn to haters (Ah)
I told you to keep your eyes open
You left me there, you left me wide open
I ain't playing, nigga I'm not joking (Ah)

[Chorus- A Boogie]
You really got me fucked up
I'm jacking fuck love
Fuck love
Nigga, what's love?
I'm jacking fuck love
