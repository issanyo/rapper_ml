[Verse 1]
I woke up, first thing I used to do was write you
Now I put on my diamond chain before my left shoe
Now I drink a Gatorade before I sweat you
Now I wish I never ever even thinkin' if it's the right move
Maybe I should have left you
Diamonds all on my right, ooh
Compliment my left, ooh
Diamonds all on my right, ooh
Diamonds all on my left, ooh
I don't really need no light, ooh
Chillin' up in my Benz coupe, yeah
Mm-mm, I be on some shit, I be in my bag, ooh
Mm-mm, I'm alright, I don't need no friends, ooh
Mm-mm, you was the only one I could vent to
Mm-mm, Dolce and Gabbana pants, ooh
Mm-mm, let me get all up in your pants, ooh
Mm-mm, I wash off all of my sins, ooh
Mm-mm, next day I'm back at it again, ooh
Mm-mm, pull up on me with them dance moves

[Chorus]
Yeah, pull up in a Wraith
'Cause I know you like goin' ghost
You my girl, you my homie though
Say you hate me, I love you mo'
Write a statement, that's all he wrote
Yeah, pull up in a Wraith

[Verse 2]
I feel like a star now, I feel like a GOAT
Gotta go to my coat, fell in love with a ghost
I'm like "Look where we are now," now they wanna get close
Wanna be my lil' hoe, tell them "Go where you go"
I'm tryna get far now, yeah, my money large now, yeah
Got a few foreign cars now, yeah, drop the roof off my car now, yeah
I don't need a guitar now, yeah, make them listen to art now, yeah
Try to break me apart now, yeah, push a button to start now, yeah
Look, I would text and call
I don't think she got the message though
I ain't stress it though
I was flexin', she was flexible
I got better hoes, I got good girls, I got ratchet hoes
Let the ratchet go, they don't know I fuck with savage hoes
Panamanians, bring your friends, you know I came with friends
Ethiopians, Puerto Ricans, I like both of them
I'm the golden kid, too much gold on so I froze it then
Big face Rollie shit, Cuban link I hope you noticed it

[Chorus]
Yeah, pull up in a Wraith
'Cause I know you like goin' ghost
You my girl, you my homie though
Say you hate me, I love you mo'
Write a statement, that's all he wrote
Yeah, pull up in a Wraith
