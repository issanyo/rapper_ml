[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
We ain't fuckin', shawty, if it ain't right
I was passin' on it since it came by
You been talkin' 'bout it, but it can't fly
Both my bitches in the club, same night
Damn, I just seem to can't get by
Long as they gon' pay me in advance, I'm fine
My lil' nigga got that 30 in his pants, I'm fine
She told me that she love a trap nigga gettin' fly

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Trap up out the bando
You don't understand tho
I skrrt with the Lambo, I will
It's 30 bands in my pants tho
I took her up out her short shorts
Fuck that bitch, commando, I will
Top down, yeah, I got you rollin'
Both my bitches in the club, got me focused
Say it to her face, don't give a fuck who I offend
I gotta keep it real, but no pretend, 'cause shawty

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
We ain't fuckin', shawty, if it ain't right
I was passin' on it since it came by
You been talkin' 'bout it, but it can't fly
Both my bitches in the club, same night
Damn, I just seem to can't get by
Long as they gon' pay me in advance, I'm fine
My lil' nigga got that 30 in his pants, I'm fine
She told me she love a trap nigga gettin' fly

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Yeah, look at how I dress, I'm fly
I just spent like 30 in Herm√®s, oh my
I told every girl she was the best, I lied
Tory, that's my nigga, that's my bro, my guy
But, please stop killin' my vibe
Dirty clip so long, it's hangin' off my side
When they hit my nigga V12 up, I cried
Hit him in the stomach and he still did not die, yeah

[Bridge: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Livin' real good, yeah, mm
And I'm still good, yeah, yeah
Bitch, I feel good, yeah, yeah
And I'm real good

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
We ain't fuckin', shawty, if it ain't right
I was passin' on it since it came by
You been talkin' 'bout it, but it can't fly
Both my bitches in the club, same night
Damn, I just seem to can't get by
Long as they gon' pay me in advance, I'm fine
My lil' nigga got that 30 in his pants, I'm fine
She told me she love a trap nigga gettin' fly
