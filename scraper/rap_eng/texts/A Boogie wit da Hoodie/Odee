[Intro]
Young Troy, you a genius
Let me beat it up like Jaegen

[Chorus]
Yeah, .44 Bulldog
Hit a nigga melon, split a nigga bean
Everybody sayin' what they gon' do, yeah
But they just talkin', they don't mean it
Try to run down with your deuce-deuce
That's a no-no, get a forty, yeah
Yeah, I know I'm probably too much, yeah
Sometimes I just be OD-in'

[Verse 1]
I was gonna go and try to fall asleep
But, I got too much energy, yeah
I was gonna go to Canada deep, but
All my niggas said they got felonies, yeah
I was gonna pull up in Givenchy, but
I just bought all this ERD shit
I'm too flee, all the groupies, yeah
They just wanna get next to me, yeah
Everybody say they run down
'Til they hear that gun sound on that lemon squeeze, yeah
Bet your homie ain't your homie
Trust me, paparazzi, that's the police, yeah

[Chorus]
.44 Bulldog
Hit a nigga melon, split a nigga bean
Everybody sayin' what they gon' do, yeah
But they just talkin', they don't mean it
Try to run down with your deuce-deuce
That's a no-no, get a forty, yeah
Yeah, I know I'm probably too much, yeah
Sometimes I just be OD-in'

[Bridge]
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, sometimes, I just be OD-in', yeah
(She like, "On God," and she know Jesus)
Sometimes, I just be OD-in'
(Girl I hold back for no reason)
Yeah, sometimes, I just be OD-in'
(Sometimes, I just be O), yeah
Sometimes, I just be OD-in'

[Verse 2]
And sometimes, I just be OD-in'
But I'm from Highbridge, what you thinkin'?
You can punch in mine if yours is readin'
And you can punch in mine if yours is readin'
I give you all my time if you give me reasons
You only call my line when you think I'm creepin'
The thirty clip too long, you can probably see it
It's a hip-hop song, but I'm R&B-in', yeah

[Chorus]
.44 Bulldog, yeah
Hit a **** melon, split a **** bean, yeah
Everybody sayin' what they gon' do, yeah
But they just talkin', they don't mean it
Try to run down with your deuce-deuce, yeah
That's a no-no, get a forty, yeah
Yeah, I know I'm probably too much, yeah
Sometimes I just be OD-in'
