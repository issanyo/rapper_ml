[Intro]
One hunnit, keep it one hunnit
I just hope you don't switch up on me
I love it when you keep it one hunnit

[Chorus]
Run it up, run it up on 'em
Girl we could run it up on 'em
I just hope you don't switch up on me
I love it when you keep it one hunnit
One hunnit, one hunnit keep it one hunnit
One hunnit, one hunnit keep it one hunni
Run it up, run it up on 'em
Girl we could run it up on 'em
I just hope you don't switch up on me
I love it when you keep it one hunnit
One hunnit, one hunnit keep it one hunnit
One hunnit, one hunnit keep it one hunni

[Verse 1]
Never really wanted to talk about it
Fuck it though I'm bout to talk about it
Something told me write a song about it
We probably ain't gonna get along about it
I froze up when I seen you with him
That shit made me want to leave you with him
I never even cheated, God damn girl I should've cheated!
And I ain't fucking with these bitches, these bitches be eating
And I don't want to be a player, you gave me a reason
Fucked some bitch the other day I wanted to get even
Why are we even doing this, let's just call it even
Am I tripping for thinking you was the one I needed?
You was all that I wanted you was my everything and
You would come home to me, I eat it up like Reese's
You was my peanut butter, you know I love my Reese's

[Chorus]
Run it up, run it up on 'em
Girl we could run it up on 'em
I just hope you don't switch up on me
I love it when you keep it one hunnit
One hunnit, one hunnit keep it one hunnit
One hunnit, one hunnit keep it one hunni


[Verse 2]
Don't you lie to me, girl be honest
If I wasn't wearing all this designer and fly shit
Tell me would you still ride like Jamaicans grinding?
And when I cop my first Beamer bet you wanna drive it
Nigga fuck it ima make it and go into college
Think she fucking cause the name of the label is Highbridge
If they wanna know the price of this motherfucking diamond
Fuck it we could talk about it with bro Avianne
And my flow so cold so I wear a Moncler
If you ratting you a dub, and you don't belong here
My bitch got a fat butt, Brazilian, long hair
God damn we been rocking Balmain all year
If you rocking with me, you rocking Balmain too
A Boogie wit da hoodie and the Balmain crew
Fifty karots on your ring if you want me too
I just hope you don't switch up, this is all we do

[Chorus]
Run it up, run it up on 'em
Girl we could run it up on 'em
I just hope you don't switch up on me
I love it when you keep it one hunnit
One hunnit, one hunnit keep it one hunnit
One hunnit, one hunnit keep it one hunni

[Outro]
Bought my new bitch a Chanel bag and she went and told her friends about it
I cut my old bitch off she so mad and I know she still think about me
No new niggas always so mad circle shining like a ring with diamonds
I keep some gangsta niggas with me know that if you even try to think about it
If they catch a body I swear I will never speak about it
Bring me my bottle all I wanna do is drink about it
I could sleep about it
This ain't even an automatic my nigga three come out it
Same damn time, that's a drilla, read about it
