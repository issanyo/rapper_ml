Woke up in Mercedes, yeah, let's ride up in a foreign car

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Don't get on my bad side, I'm dangerous
Demons and angels hang with us
Treat it like a phone, baby, hang it up, uh
Throw your side up, go 'head, bang it up
Don't fuck with me, no, I'm dangerous, uh

And I swear I get all up in my feelings when you're not around, yeah

Make you wanna break the fucking door off my Benz, yeah
