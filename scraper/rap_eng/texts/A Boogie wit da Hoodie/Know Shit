[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Y'all don't ever know shit
On the road so long they'll think I'm homeless
Four phones, three hoes, too good for one bitch
I been on some cold shit, they don't need to know shit, woah
They don't need to know shit
I just did a few shows, now my neck the coldest
And I'm with some niggas that'll beat you like you stole shit
When you see me posted, act like you don't know (You don't know)

[Verse 1: Monty]
Ayy, money I'ma go get
Monty from the Zoo, you don't need to know shit
Wasn't there when I was down, you was on some go shit
Bad bitch from the town, I give her the whole dick
Ayy, ayy, lil' nigga hold this
And I'm screamin' 17, you know who I roll with
And she playin' for the team, you gon' let my bro hit
Monty ooh be so slick, pull up on 'em, oh shit (Skrrt, skrrt)
I be with a dime ho
Got so many diamonds in my Rollie you'd think time froze
Gettin' to the money 'cause the money on my mind though
You know how I'm livin', prolly in a different time zone
Remy Boyz in Highbridge, and your ho my side bitch
Monty Zoo, I got this, I be on some hot shit
Remy Boyz in Highbridge, and your ho my side bitch
Monty Zoo, I got this, I be on some hot shit, yeah

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Y'all don't ever know shit
On the road so long they'll think I'm homeless
Four phones, three hoes, too good for one bitch
I been on some cold shit, they don't need to know shit, woah
They don't need to know shit
I just did a few shows, now my neck the coldest
And I'm with some niggas that'll beat you like you stole shit
When you see me posted, act like you don't know (You don't know)

[Verse 2: Monty]
And I've been on some cold shit, I've been on some cold shit
If you see me posted, act like you don't know shit
I be shittin' on my haters, know I make 'em so sick
Four phones, three hoes I can get a lil' wet, ayy, ayy
She gon' give me dome quick
On the road so long, man I think I'm homesick
And I'm with some niggas that'll beat you like you stole shit
I'm with Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, got it locked and loaded
I just did a few shows, I'ma need a few Os
Monty Zoo, I'm up next, got these niggas upset
Remy Boyz in Highbridge, and your ho my side bitch
Monty Zoo, I got this, I be on some hot shit, yeah

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Y'all don't ever know shit
On the road so long they'll think I'm homeless
Four phones, three hoes, too good for one bitch
I been on some cold shit, they don't need to know shit, woah
They don't need to know shit
I just did a few shows, now my neck the coldest
And I'm with some niggas that'll beat you like you stole shit
When you see me posted, act like you don't know (You don't know)
Woah
