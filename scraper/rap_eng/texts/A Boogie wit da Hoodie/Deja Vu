[Intro]
Let me beat it up like Jaegen

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
It feels like deja vu, with you
We ain't the type to be sleeping on
It's like I seen you in my dreams before
I might lose my cool, with you
Show me things I never seen before
Shawty make my dreams come true

[Verse 1: J Alvarez]
Yo sé esto iba a pasar, metida de blanco en mi cama
Eres mi gata oficial, y estamos meti'os en el drama
Accesorios Versace, aroma de Dolce & Gabbana
Seguimos contando dinero, adicto a la fama
Ando con un hoodie como Boogie
Montandome el jet para Zürich
Soñé con otra movie, no lo dudes
Hasta que la envidia nos salude

[Pre-Chorus: J Alvarez]
Tu sombra, ¿qué tú tramas?
Te estoy esperando, ¿por qué no me hablas?
Sombra, ¿qué tú tramas?
Tu cuerpo me hipnotiza, me aumentan las ganas

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, J Alvarez]
It feels like deja vu, with you
We ain't the type to be sleeping on
It's like I seen you in my dreams before
I might lose my cool, with you
Show me things I never seen before
Shawty make my dreams come true

This feel like deja vu, with you
Como si te hubiera visto antes
Baby no he parado de soñarte
Sólo si estás tú
El espacio se me hace grande
Si no estás tú

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I just want you on top of me
I hope you ain't thinking you a slide to me
I hope you ain't looking for apologies
Still don't know what sorry means
All you wanna do is make to love me
I was only looking for some company
Is you gonna ride like I ride the beat?
If not, that's fine with me
Stashbox, that nine on me
I can make that pain go away
When I got that drum on me
I can make that hate go away
Christian, I got blood on me
Niggas die everyday so I pray
When I got that puck on me
I got so much weight on my chain

[Bridge: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Now she wanna go-go, yeah
I been on the road so, yeah
Money in my old clothes, yeah
Money couldn't fold, oh yeah
Can you drop it low, oh yeah
Can you drop it low, oh yeah
Had to drop my old hoes, yeah
(Had to drop my old hoes, yeah)

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Must be worried about the wrong things
Still be thinking they can call me
Left them there, I left them salty
She love Givenchy, love Givenchy
Whatever you wanna call it
Shake em up like get 'em off me
Hit 'em up and get 'em off me
I left her there now she lost me
I run it up with my gang, ay
I make all the bitches say “ay”
She don't like me no, she love A
It get ugly where I’m from, ay
It get ugly if you touch A
Now she say she wanna fuck A
Fuck it I ain't even trippin'
'Cause I ain't hit it in a minute

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
It feels like deja vu, with you
We ain't the type to be sleeping on
It's like I seen you in my dreams before
I might lose my cool, with you
Show me things I've never seen before
Shawty make my dreams come true
