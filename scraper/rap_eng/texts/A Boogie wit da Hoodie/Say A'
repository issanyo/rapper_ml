[Intro]
(Ness on the beat)
What the fuck I'm supposed to say?
What the fuck I'm supposed to say? Ayy

[Chorus]
What the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ayy
Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Hold up, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ayy
Gotta pray a lot, niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I feel a way then I'm gon' say it to your face, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I just might make 100K, yeah
If they put a price on me, I'll double what they pay, yeah
They say they don't like me, give a fuck 'bout what they say, yeah
I could take your bitch and make you think about what you say, yeah
I'm gon' put her in a leg lock like MMA, yeah
I'm gon' let her give me head twice if she don't say shit
If she ever turn sherm on me then she basic
Couple bitches had to swerve on 'em, I updated
You pulled up with her, she ain't leave with who she came with
She deserve better, you's a bird, you's a wasteman
Fuck a umbrella, change weather in my spaceship
Diamonds dancing, I'm two-stepping with my bracelet
So, get the fuck up out my face
I'm just on my way to get this money and I'm late, okay
In the strip club throwing twenties like "I'll be okay"
100k a day, trap booming like an 808

[Chorus]
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ayy
Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I feel a way then I'm gon' say it to your face, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

[Verse 2]
Hold up, talking shit don't ever get to me
When they see me now, they'd better have that same energy
In abandoned houses, in and out, it wasn't shit to me
When you see me now, don't try to act like you remember me
Then look at me now, bitch I'm drowning
And my hoodie Saint Laurent, it's a thousand
And we come straight out the Bronx so we wildin'
Shoutout BK, free Bobby and free Rowdy
Free my nigga V12, holla if you see 12
Febreze, believe me, it'll cover the weed smell
I probably got 3 mill, sitting in my email
So much on me, they second guessing what we sell
So much money on me, fuck it if it's dirty money
Cause I earned it, you get murked if you come searchin' for me
When the police pulled me over, I had 30 on me
What the fuck I look like with less than 30 on me, nigga?

[Chorus]
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ayy
Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, yeah

[Outro]
I'll make her say a'
I'll make her say a'
I'll make her say a'
