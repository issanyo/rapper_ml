[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Can't nobody tell me shit about my day one
Day one 'til that day come
Who'd ever thought it'd be my day one
Can't nobody tell me shit about my day one
Seen some shit that get you murked if you say some
It hurt to kill a nigga you love
And I know that she addicted to drugs
That's why she giving it up
Gang members and dealers was who she hang with
Me and all my niggas was on that same shit
Fuck it, we was even fucking on the same bitch
But we ain't never have no problems that was gang shit
All the promises we made 'bout how we can't switch
I just wanted to be rich instead of famous
I was trapping with the niggas that I stayed with
Feds watching, we was ducking them cases
Black hoodie, just to cover my face up
Niggas be bitches, they switch up and try to make up

[Chorus: A Boogie]
My day one
I thought you was my day one
My day one
You was supposed to be my day one
My day one
I thought you was my day one
My day one
You was supposed to be my day one

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Damn, homie
I thought you was my man, homie
What the fuck happened to you
I could've sworn you knew better
Held it down for a minute then you ended up telling
When it rains, yeah, it pours, better bring an umbrella
They don't wanna see me winning, be so fake and so jealous
Way before I had the fame, I had Balmain and Margiela's
I ain't fucking with no rat, man, I ain't eating no cheddar
Yeah, I swear I had your back, I was down whenever
Now it ain't no looking back, nigga, it's now or never
Yeah, it ain't no looking back, nigga, it's now or never
Now or never, now or never
Yeah, yeah
Now or never, now or never
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
This ain't what you want, just think about it, nigga, yeah, yeah
I'ma fuck around and catch a body, nigga, yeah, yeah
Niggas want me out of here, I gotta be aware, yeah
Bitches ain't shit and I ain't really understand that
Oh, she think she bad, Gucci bag, she like "yeah yeah"
Oh, she run it up, run it up, got them bands, yeah
Hanging 'round them bitches she was telling me she can't stand
Fucking other niggas, even though she got a man, yeah
Now she know she wrong, she alone in the can, yeah
Got caught up with hammers in the crib and some Xans, yeah
They ain't even care about a warrant, they just ran in
Everybody wanna know the word, asking questions
Everybody want to know the word about a dead man
Everybody wanna catch him slipping, he a dead man
Heard a nigga been telling them people what we said, yeah
Find out who he is and I'm gone leave that nigga laying there

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
My day one
I thought you was my day one
My day one
You was supposed to be my day one
My day one
I thought you was my day one
My day one
You was supposed to be my day one
My day one
I thought you was my day one
My day one
You was supposed to be my day one
My day one
I thought you was my day one
My day one
You was supposed to be my day one
