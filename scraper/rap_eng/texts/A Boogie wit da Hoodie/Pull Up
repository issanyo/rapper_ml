[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Ooh
I pulled up in a Benz truck, ooh
You pulled up in your friend's truck, mmh
Better watch out for the scammers, ooh
Boy, you better get your bands up, mmh
She a pretty little dancer, ooh
I might take her to my mansion, mmh
Hit her, then I vanish, ooh
All about my business

[Verse 1: NAV]
Buy my hood bitch a Lexus
She told me I'm the bestest
Diamonds in my necklace (Ooh-ooh)
Everything I do impressive
Always in my best fit
I don't need a press kit (Ooh-ooh)
My-my time is too precious
I ignore her message
Already on the next bitch (Ooh-ooh)
She wet just like a jet-ski
Took her on the jet
She let me fuck her and her bestie (Ooh-ooh)
Heard they wanna test me
But I got a cheat sheet
Sendin' hits on repeat (Yeah)
My teachers try to reach me
There's nothing they can teach me
AP flooded with Fiji (Yeah)

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Ooh
I pulled up in a Benz truck, ooh
You pulled up in your friend's truck, mmh
Better watch out for the scammers, ooh
Boy, you better get your bands up, mmh
She a pretty little dancer, ooh
I might take her to my mansion, mmh
Hit her, then I vanish, ooh
All about my business, mmh

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Forty on the dresser
Niggas acting reckless
They don't want that pressure, yeah yeah
Dressed up in Hermes stuff
Different Gucci sweaters
Bustdown on the bezel, yeah yeah
She don't love me, she just love my fragrance
I spent so much on my chain, it just don't make sense
To all my family and all my niggas, I'm still gon' break bread
Know my secrets, can you keep it? Please don't say shit
'Cause if she feeling me, then I'ma be all in there like, "Oh"
She gon' swear to me that no one else can hit that like, "Oh, oh"
I don't wanna go through this, I been there before
Bitches with no makeup, yeah, I love it, you know-oh

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Ooh
I pulled up in a Benz truck, ooh
You pulled up in your friend's truck, mmh
Better watch out for the scammers, ooh
Boy, you better get your bands up, mmh
She a pretty little dancer, ooh
I might take her to my mansion, mmh
Hit her, then I vanish, ooh
All about my business, mmh

[Outro: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
All about my (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All about my business (Mmh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(All about my business, mmh)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(All about my business, yeah)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(All about my)
