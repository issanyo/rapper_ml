Lil bitch this ain’t no mother fucking theme song
You know I pop pills 'til the pain gone
I know they wanna catch me slipping
But it ain’t worth it
And I be tranna do it all
But I ain’t perfect
And I don’t want no goofy niggas in my damn circle
Fuck it ima quit rapping if the band working
And even though I been rolling with the same niggas
I started noticing I ain’t really the same nigga
I started wearing more watches wearing more rings nigga
Yeah shoot out the money can’t really change niggas
Yeah, and I come through Christians on my feet
Girl we gon' bleed together
And I know you gonna keep it G who you gonna need forever
Girl you know that I get a lotta
Money but that’s nothing
Girl you know how I feel about ya
It’s hard to show you that I care about ya
If it come down to it I’ll probably do a drill 'bout ya
