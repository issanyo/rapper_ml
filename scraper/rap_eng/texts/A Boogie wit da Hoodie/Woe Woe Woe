[Intro]
It's a New Wave

[Chorus: Loso Loaded]
Woe woe woe
What you think you doing?
Boy you can't finesse me
I'm way too influenced
I’m the same nigga that jug
I’m the same nigga in the hood
I’m the same nigga that trap
I’m the same nigga with the strap
Woe woe woe
What you think you doing?
Bitch you can't finesse me
I'm way too influenced
You sayin' bitch you broke
You sayin' bitch need help
Bitch you ain't got no hope
Keep two sets to yourself

[Verse 1: A Boogie]
I don't know why these bitches choosing
Tryin catch me slipping, oh well bitch you blew it
Fall back game improving, what you think you doing
I came with a shooter, he get paid for shootin'
I don't want to use her but she think I'm stupid
Every time she pull up she put on my jewelry
But she get on her knees first
Wanna wear my t-shirts
Wanna be my main squeeze
I hop in a b skirt like

[Chorus: Loso Loaded]
Woe woe woe
What you think you doing?
Boy you can't finesse me
I'm way too influenced
I’m the same nigga that jug
I’m the same nigga in the hood
I’m the same nigga that trap
I’m the same nigga with the strap
Woe woe woe
What you think you doing?
Bitch you can't finesse me
I'm way too influenced
You sayin' bitch you broke
You sayin' bitch need help
Bitch you ain't got no hope
Keep two sets to yourself
