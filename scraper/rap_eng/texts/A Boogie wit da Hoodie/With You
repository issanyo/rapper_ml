[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'd rather be with you, yeah
Said I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, yeah
Said I'd rather be with you

[Verse: Don Q]
Met her on fifth ave she was on her fifth bag
She gave me whiplash as soon as the whip pass
Tried to keep it calm, I beeped the horn had my VV's on
GT Bents off top with the TVs on
Baby don't be alarmed I acknowledge your worth
I can tell inside you was hurt
She reply with a smirk
What's your motto at work
Serve bottles and twerk
Listen I ain't here to judge I done gave my time to the worst
She said, "Nigga stop it
I'm still in college, momma in the projects
I promise her I'll go and visit when I finish shopping"
Got her son on the weekend, I let my sister watch him
"My baby father rarely see him they ain't really bonding
But what you want with me I know you got a list of options"
Baby girl I see the gossip fucking with your conscience
I just left the nail salon, you was the trending topic
What a coincidence, I just got the Bentley polished
What's your name? She said, "Sherene", yeah she was quick responding
What's your number, let's link up for later for some shrimp and lobster
Yeah I got a chef, just make sure you got a dress
You can't look me in my eyes and tell me you not impressed
If you play your cards right, you'll be on a private jet
Liquor toast, switching coasts, flying you out the west
I could show you better than I can tell you, I'm tryna' bless you
Diamond bezel on your arm if I feel that you kinda special
I could take you out the ghetto now that's different kind of levels
Ran through a thousand hoes I never found the time to settle
Nah, fuck them hating hoes tryna' throw shade
I could look in your eyes and see we soul mates
If you gon' be mine, then you go both ways
Baby girl ride like she got road rage
I might move her in the spot and be my home mate
Fuck a restaurant I want my dinner homemade
Old age wine, sipping at a slow pace
City to city I'll bring her to all my show dates
Let's get acquainted I made edible arrangements
My bezel too outrageous, she seen't and nearly fainted
Don't you fight or run look at the closet, never seen't a flyer one
"Louis palace, who your stylist, where you get your attires from?"
Just tell me what I wanna hear and don't you ever bite your tongue
Bet I haver her out her underwear before the night is done

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'd rather be with you, yeah
Said I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, yeah
Said I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, yeah
Said I'd rather be with you
