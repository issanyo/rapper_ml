[Intro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Nah nah nah
Nah, nah nah nah
Nah nah-nah nah
Yeah-yeah, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
Yes I've been drinking, yes I'm pretending
That I don't need your love
It's been a long week, don't try to stop me
Don't stop 'til the liquor's done
I don't need pussy, yeah I'ma flex it
And buy it for everyone
Yes I've been drinking, yes I'm pretending
My baby won't pick up

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Hm, sorry if I don't pick up
I was off that 42 and yeah, I'm still fucked up
I'm just like you, you're just like me, and they all just like us
I was only 13, Ahk let me buy my Dutch
I need that Urus, 'bout to go and get that Lambo truck (skrt)
Skert off try to merc us, they might get merced first
I got a fox up in my coat, and it got real fox fur
It's 5AM and I've been drinkin' so my words might slur, yeah

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez & Both]
Yes I've been drinking, yes I'm pretending
That I don't need your love
It's been a long week, don't try to stop me
Don't stop 'til the liquor's done
I don't need pussy, yeah I'ma flex it
And buy it for everyone
Yes I've been drinking, yes I'm pretending
My baby won't pick up

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
They'll probably think we're pretending, they won't believe us
Creepin' and hopin' nobody seen us
I made sure you had like every pair of sneaker
But every time I saw you I would freeze up
If I write you more than once would I be beastin', hm
Fuck a triple date, let's have a threesome, hm
Fuck you in your face might have you leakin', hm
She love my diamond chains and all my pieces, hm

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez & Both]
Yes I've been drinking, yes I'm pretending
That I don't need your love
It's been a long week, don't try to stop me
Don't stop 'til the liquor's done
I don't need pussy, yeah I'ma flex it
And buy it for everyone
Yes I've been drinking, yes I'm pretending
My baby won't pick up
