[Intro]
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na


[Chorus]
I just wanna stack dough, count more, I don't know niggas
You ain't my bro, you a hoe so you just don't get it
Bitches really tripping, if you looking for a check go get it
Bitch, I'm the wrong nigga
You fucking with the wrong nigga
I'm the wrong nigga
You fucking with the wrong nigga
I'm the wrong wrong nigga

[Verse 1]
Here's a couple words for you just in case you really don't get it
I can scoop any bitch I want but I wasn't gon' sweat it
Write me every minute wondering if I'm gon' be there already
I put it in a song cause I couldn't fit it all in one message
So I know she gon' get it, I know she gon' get it
I don't put my time into the bitches they be tripping
I bet they wish they can all get me
I make you feel so special, I know this already
I know I'm fucked up but it's still fucked up how it happened now you gone baby
I, treated you so wrong baby, now how can we get along baby
I can't help it I've been selfish I know I was wrong baby
What the fuck was you expecting, I'm moving on now baby
I did what I did, now I gotta move on cause I feel like you just gone play me

[Chorus]
I just wanna stack dough, count more, I don't know niggas
You ain't my bro, you a hoe so you just don't get it
Bitches really tripping, if you looking for a check go get it
Bitch, I'm the wrong nigga
You fucking with the wrong nigga
I'm the wrong nigga
You fucking with the wrong nigga
I'm the wrong wrong nigga

[Verse 2]
Don't cross the line tryna line me
Dumb nigga lost his mind while he was thinking 'bout it
I wrote every single song, don't try to copy
Fuck a nigga baby moms for tryna plagiarize me
My ex bitch so bad that she ain't around me
My ex bitch so mad, made a mistake about me
I know you probably can't sleep, you couldn't lay without me
Oh it's so so sad that you ain't around me
Can't believe I really made a whole tape about you
I made a song just to let you know I think about you
I don't even drink but everyday I drink about you
But, nowadays I don't give a fuck about you
Now I got a baddie sitting up in my coupe
Married to the money motherfucker "I do"
I'm rocking Buscemi even though I like Loubs
So you gotta use a key to walk in my shoes
They tryna keep up like the fuck do I do
Keeping it 100 like 50 times 2

[Outro]
I was the wrong nigga, wrong, wrong
Fucking with the wrong nigga
Wrong, wrong wrong
Wrong nigga, wrong nigga
Wrong nigga, wrong nigga
Wrong nigga wrong nigga, wrong nigga
I'm the wrong nigga, wrong nigga, wrong nigga
I'm the wrong nigga
