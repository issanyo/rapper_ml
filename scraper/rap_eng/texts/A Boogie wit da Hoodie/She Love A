[Intro]
Ness on the beat

[Chorus]
She like, she don't wanna fall in love, but she love A
She get jealous, all her friends around her wanna fuck A
She thought I was stuck with her, so I left her stuck, ayy
Yeah I know you feel offended, but you won't touch A
She like, "I don't really wanna come where you from A,"
"'Cause I heard a lot of stories about where you from A,"
She like, "Oh, you rock Amiri with that Louis Vuitton, A?"
They like, "Oh, this is a light year, you got a buzz," ayy

[Verse]
I don't really wanna fight, yeah, I got a gun, ayy
I don't like it when you bite baby, use your tongue, ayy
I can make you my Beyonc√©, if you want, ayy
I'ma bang you like LeBron, ayy, give me 1K
I can party on a Sunday, if I want, ayy
Cop a Rari on a Monday and hit my Tay-K
And I know she drive me crazy, but that's my baby
A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, but just call me baby
They can't wait to catch me slippin', I'ma leave 'em waitin'
If we hit 'em up, just promise me you never say shit
You know Bubba, that's my brother, but we ain't related
You can catch him in the cut with his eyes lazy
In the Bentley, now I'm yellin' "Fuck a train station"
Got a mansion and a condo, never missed a payment
I spent 17 thousand on a diamond bracelet
Got the money and the power, and they started hatin'

[Chorus]
She like, she don't wanna fall in love, but she love A
She get jealous, all her friends around her wanna fuck A
She thought I was stuck with her, so I left her stuck, ayy
Yeah I know you feel offended, but you won't touch A
She like, "I don't really wanna come where you from A,"
"'Cause I heard a lot of stories about where you from A,"
She like, "Oh, you rock Amiri with that Louis Vuitton, A?"
They like, "Oh, this is a light year, you got a buzz," ayy
