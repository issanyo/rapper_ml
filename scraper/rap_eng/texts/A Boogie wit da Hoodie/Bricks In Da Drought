[Intro]
Yo was poppin' gunnas
(Spanish Conversation)

[Hook: Billionaire Black]
We got them bricks in the drought
That work, coming in, coming out
That broke nigga runnin' his mouth
Told the nigga pipe down
Shoot in your face, you got motor mouth
We run the town that is not a doubt
Yo bitch wanna fuck, we got all the cloud
Shooters that die at that chopper sound
(Repeats)

[Verse 1: Billionaire Black]
We got that dope off the boat
We get that shit by the low

Nigga you goofin' so move around
Nigga talk crazy, we shoot em' down

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I ain't even gotta do it
I step in the booth, tell my shooters - shootie shooter
I tell em twice and then he lose em
My niggas is ruthless
Arrow on me like I'm cupid
Pull up on me if you stupid, I know what to do
Hit em twice, I make em stupid
I'll make em say who hit em, Nigga this is what I do
Never thought I'd finish school, so I stood on that corner
Everyday stood on that corner
When it's still dark in the morning, I'll be on that corner
And Imma still be on that corner
Until I'm parking the foreign
Cutting through you like a shark in the water
You shouda knew I mix it up when I pour it
My nigga, Blackie, pass it to me I caught it
Like pimpin' that Jordan, you know that I'm scoring
I'm back on my bully, "A Boogie" on the back of my hoodie
Two bitches on my line, that's a goodie
Talking shit behind my back, that's a pussy
Got them bricks, "they coming in, coming out"
Lotta niggas know they runnin' they mouth
Yeah you know, we got that shit for the low
B-Brickas got them bricks in the drought
