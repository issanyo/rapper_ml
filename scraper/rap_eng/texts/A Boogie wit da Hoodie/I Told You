[Intro: Interviewer & Don Q]
So you have a daughter?
Yeah, I got a daughter
How old is your daughter?
She's 7
Wow, ok, so she- I mean she's big, she's up there
Yeah, she know what time it is
Do she hear the records? She's at that age where she hear the records
She be on youtube, I think her favorite artist is A Boogie
She know all his songs, like when I be talking to her all she do is play A Boogie
(Ness on the beat)
I told you, you was gon' regret it
Yeah
Ha ha
Told you, told you, I told you

[Bridge: Don Q]
You shoulda just listened, I told you
You left me on seen when I wrote you
Bitch you gon' make me expose you
Don't front on a nigga that know you
You doubted me from the beginning, so I had to really go get it and show you
It's deeper than music, you really didn't think I would do it back when I was local

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Don Q]
You shoulda just listened to me when I said it
Look at your face now you regret it
I wake up every morning and go get it
I know you hated how I never sweated you
I came up in a second
Jumpman on me they couldn't check 'em
Hypeman on the stage with the weapon
100 thousand worth of Louis and credit
You shoulda just listened to me when I said it
I never responded to you but I read it
I got a bunch of diamonds on my necklace
I got a 100 thousand on my debit
You was supposed to be with me just countin' up
But you wasn't down enough
I'm drippin' my jewelry is fountained up
Options of bitches
I get 'em and pile 'em up

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Don Q]
All my niggas want the same shit
That's what they who I came with
If I tell you how my day went, your probably change who you hang with
I like money conversations, nothing else really makes sense
I like money conversations, let's go and rob a bank then
Let's go and rob a bank, my money no limit I might go and buy a tank
Hop out in designer minks my pinky ring bigger than Shabba Ranks
All of the dirt we was doin', the work we was movin'
Like what would my mama think
If she had seen all that left over residue stuck on the plate that's behind the safe
Now I give a fuck what your honor think
I walk in the court with a pint of drank
To pay your ticket on some petty shit
250 in cash on some Fetty shit
Now where was you when I had hunger pain's
Because of fame or love has changed
I'm twisted, I'm sippin' on muddy rain
Got me takin' these drugs tryna numb the pain

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Don Q]
You shoulda just listened to me when I said it
Look at your face now you regret it
I wake up every morning and go get it
I know you hated how I never sweated you
I came up in a second
Jumpman on me they couldn't check 'em
Hypeman on the stage with the weapon
100 thousand worth of Louis and credit
You shoulda just listened to me when I said it
I never responded to you but I read it
I got a bunch of diamonds on my necklace
I got a 100 thousand on my debit
You was supposed to be when was just countin' up
But you wasn't down enough
I'm drippin' my jewelry is fountained up
Options of  bitches I get them and pile 'em up

[Verse 2: Don Q]
Can't waste no time with these hoes nowadays
'Cause they always comin' with they hand out
I asked for the number, you curved me
But the bitch was quick to give her 'gram out
But you come to my section you drinkin' my bottles and you was quick to pull your cam' out
That's why I'm quick to pull the lamb out
Got 'em falling for me cause I stand out
If it get cold it's aight
We could get low and switch coast on a flight, yeah, yeah
You turn a hoe to a wife,  I turn a wife to a hoe for the night, yeah
Lil' niggas got me started up, I promise they ain't goin' hard enough
You gon' make me go and load the Carbon up, leave these bullet holes in the party bus
Private jet getting chartered up, choppas on me boy I'm Harley'd up
Couple thousands boy you hardly up, I could spend that when I go and hit Barney’s up
It takes a risk just to pay the rent, I could pay the stripper and then make it flip
Take a trip with no 8%, in my latest whip making haters sick
I jump in the Wraith and I make a wish, they squintin' they eyes when I wave the wrist
My chain, and my ring, and my bracelet, so there ain't no need for the flash when I take a pic
30 thousand keep the collar froze, gotta stay away from outta pocket hoes
Yea They watchin plottin' on your pot of gold, I can't even knock 'em, I know how it go

[Bridge: Don Q]
You shoulda just listened, I told you
You left me on seen when I wrote you
Bitch you gon' make me expose you
Don’t front on a nigga that know you
You doubted me from the beginning, so I had to really go get it and show you
It's deeper than music, you really didn't think I would do it back when I was local

[Chorus 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Don Q]
You shoulda just listen to me when I said it
I never responded to you but I read it
I wake up every morning and go get it
I got a 100 thousand on my debit
You was supposed to be when was just countin' up
But you wasn't down enough
I'm drippin' my jewelry is fountained up
Optiond of bitches, I get them and pile 'em up

[Outro: Don Q]
You shoulda just listened, I told you
