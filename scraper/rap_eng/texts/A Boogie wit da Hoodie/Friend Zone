[Intro]
Another one, it's another one
And another one
Huh?

[Chorus]
Every time I make another one, it's another one
Don't be all up on my french toast when that butter come
She tried to put me in the friend zone, but she wanted some
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone cause I fuck with her
After fuckin' her
She tried to put me in the friend zone
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone
Scorin' like the end zone

[Verse 1]
Two doors, black on black whip
Told that bitch that I'm from New York, she like my accent
Every time I get a new jawn, she the baddest
All these zippers on my Balmain, I feel like Jackson
Every time she give me good head, I give her backshots
Man that pussy so good, I don't wanna back out
So I gotta strap up, just to blow her back out
When she know I'm 'bout to nut, she don't tell me back out
She put her ass out
That's what happened before I passed out
She really got me in my bag now
She got me in my bag now
Huh?

[Chorus]
Every time I make another one, it's another one
Don't be all up on my french toast when that butter come
She tried to put me in the friend zone, but she wanted some
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone cause I fuck with her
After fuckin' her
She tried to put me in the friend zone
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone
Scorin' like the end zone
Huh?

[Verse 2]
I laughed with her, smoked gas with her
When I showed her I can rap, she said, "You a bad nigga"
I said, "What about your man?" She said, "Fuck that nigga"
You must have been doin' bad with her
She said she only let me hit to get you mad
Oh, it's so sad, nigga
Takin' niggas bitches back to back, yeah I'm that nigga
A-Boogie on her titty, took my autograph with her
Whoever she goin' home to, I feel bad for that nigga
He gon' be a mad nigga
He won't even wanna talk about it
When we started fuckin' she promised we never talk about it
Bitches be for everybody, nigga why you trippin' 'bout it
Fuck a nigga bitch, now I can't even leave the crib without it
He a bitch about it
Yeah he a bitch about it it
Fucked a nigga bitch, now I can't even leave the crib without it
Yeah he a bitch about it

[Outro]
Every time I make another one, it's another one
Don't be all up on my french toast when that butter come
She tried to put me in the friend zone, but she wanted some
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone cause I fuck with her
After fuckin' her
She tried to put me in the friend zone
Ah! Another one
Ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Another one, it's another one
Na-na-na-na-na-na
