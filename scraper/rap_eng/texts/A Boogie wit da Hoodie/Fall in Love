[Intro]
Baby you ain't never fucked with a thug
So wassup I'll make you fall in love with it
Make you fall in love with it

[Verse 1]
Fuck it, I'm goin' in now, watch what I do to this
Nobody told me this shit I had to get used to it
Niggas thinkin' I'm buggin', they think I'm losing it
Michael Jordan I'm ballin', they think I'm hoopin' it
She popped a perk and it's workin' so I go through with it
I sip a cup of the lean and then I go through with it
She moanin', screamin' and tell me keep on doin' it
I'm A Boogie, whats goodie, baby I'm true to this
I pulled up in my hoodie so you could know it's me
Ayo that's word to my F it ain't a hoe in me
A nigga talk behind my back that's a hoe to me
A nigga gave me his word and then he told on me
He ain't really hold it down, how it's supposed to be
I should've put him in the ground, how its supposed to be
Bodies tryna get found while I'm rollin' weed
Ski mask, I'm hoping that they don't notice me
Choppa knock a nigga down on purpose
I'll pull up with a fuckin' Trey Pound on purpose (Ah)
Ra Sosa got a thottie on him twerkin'
Gotti with me waves lettin' niggas drown on purpose (Ah)
Nay Glizzy he a hound on purpose
That's my dog, I'll never let him down on purpose
Bubba told me go wild on purpose
Nigga why the fuck you think I'm goin' wild on 'em? (Ah)
I'm puttin' pain on em'
Hollow tip, I let it rip
I let it rain on em'
Fuck a hook, I put a chain on 'em
I tie that shit 'round ya neck
I spill the brains on em'
I know that shit ain't been the same niggas
Change on you for the money and the fame
But I'm
Goin' up like a plane nigga
I ain't even gotta tell 'em I ain't playin' with 'em (Ah)

[Chorus]
But I'm goin' up
Baby you ain't never fucked with a thug
So wassup, I'll make you fall in love with it
And she know wassup
And she know I keep a gun in the glove
And it's tough 'cause she hold it when I'm done with it
But I'm goin' up
Baby you ain't never fucked with a thug
So wassup, I'll make you fall in love with it
And she know wassup
And she know I keep a gun in the glove
And it's tough 'cause she hold it when I'm done with it

[Verse 2]
And I ain't even gon' lie
A lot of niggas say they gon' ride
They ain't really gon' ride
They don't want to be a homicide
So they callin' niggas bro
But they really playin' both sides
I don't trust a nigga, bottom line
And I don't trust a bitch, bottom line
Just because she on ya ride
That don't mean she ya ride or die
Your worst enemy could be right by your side

[Chorus]
But I'm goin' up
Baby you ain't never fucked with a thug
So wassup, I'll make you fall in love with it
And she know wassup
And she know I keep a gun in the glove
And it's tough 'cause she hold it when I'm done with it

[Bridge]
Yeah, she gone hold it when I'm done wit' it
She gone hold it when I'm done wit' it
She already know wassup wit' it
I'm the plug wit' it
Baby now I'm havin' fun wit' it
I'ma thug wit' it
I'ma keep on goin' tho', keep on goin'

[Chorus]
Now I'm goin' up, baby you ain't never fucked with a thug
So wassup I'll make you fall in love with it
I think she know.. and she know I keep a gun in glove
And it;s tough cause she hold it whenever I'm done wit' it
Now I'm goin' up
Baby you ain't ever fucked with a thug
So wassup I'll make you fall in love with it
And she know wassup
And she know I keep a gun in a glove
And its tough 'cause she hold it whenever I'm done with it
