[Intro]
I came to the conclusion that
A lot of y'all niggas just be talking just to talk
But you see where I'm from
I mean
We do shit a little different
A Boogie Wassup!!

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
You can tell me this and you can tell me that
But I don't give a fuck and nigga that's a fact
'Cause the fakest niggas say the realest shit
Then the realest niggas say it after that
And now I'm running down with some black sweats
A black hoodie and some black boots
A ski mask with a hat that match
So that's black on black on black on black on black on black
And bitch I'm running down
Matter fact I used to fuck with niggas that go back to back on me in situations
Like if I get hit up then my niggas quick to let that MAC attack
And now I'm going down
'Cause where I'm from you either clap the ratchet or the ratchet clap at niggas that be actin'
Better have it on you 'cause I got it on me I ain't havin' that
And when I run around
I ain't playing no games with them
Fuck a PlayStation 2K's hit 'em
If he call 12 let the gauge hit him (Let the gauge hit him)
If you catch me riding shotgun that mean I got one
Ain't no competition fuck 5,4,3,2 bitch I'm top 1
I be with a couple niggas from the city
Yeah them niggas greedy
Pockets lookin' kinda Puffy
Call me Diddy 10's,20's and 100's 50's
I need everything even 1's and pennies
I need Megan Good to let me suck her titties
I need OVO to sign me for a milli
Niggas need to know that they ain't fucking with me
If you looking for me you can come and get me I'll be waitin'

[Hook: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Yeah, That's word to my F yo I ride for this shit (I ride for this shit)
Them niggas I rode with they ride for they shit (They ride for they shit)
Them niggas I roll with is trying to get rich, when we rich
Pull up on every bitch that ever fronted when we ain't have money
Now I ain't got time for this shit
Ladder on me like I'm climbing and shit
In my bag like I'm shopping and shit
Blood with me like he poppin and shit
Batman with me like we Robin and shit
Zip 'em up like I'm bodyin shit
Gloves on like we boxing and shit
Fuck it tho I ain't got time for this shit

[Verse 2: King Ceazar]
(Yeah, yeah)
What would you do if I passed the assist
Most of my life we can't manage this shit
Tryna be a preacher and a pastor and shit
Wonder when I die what happens after this shit
I got into a fight and had a box cutter try to leave a nigga like a pizzeria
It was 12 AM and everybody sleepin' now I'm in the crib doin' Santeria
'Cuz I need them Benjamins
Look to the people, tell David let him in (At Night!)
The rockers of ganja (Oooh)
We got the shit that be breaking the glass like it's opera
Tats on my skin the ink it was there
But I love the fucking pain nigga
Smoking so much weed a nigga can't even see think I'm fucking going insane nigga
Addicted to paranoia (let's go)
This is a sign of creativity
Like I'm looking in the sky then I wonder why they ain't really hittin' me
Forget about the hate and the pain and most of all all the misery
And it's a mystery
To get the 4 kids and the dog to try to figure me lil' nigga
Stoic Stoic

[Hook: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & *King Ceazar*]
Yeah, That's word to my F yo I ride for this shit
(I ride for this shit)
*(Yeah, yeah)*
Them niggas I rode with they ride for they shit
(They ride for they shit)
*(Yeah, yeah)*
Them niggas I roll with is trying to get rich, when we rich
Pull up on every bitch that ever fronted when we ain't have money
Now I ain't got time for this shit
Ladder on me like I'm climbing and shit
In my bag like I'm shopping and shit
Blood with me like he poppin and shit
Batman with me like we Robin and shit
Zip 'em up like I'm bodyin shit
Gloves on like we boxing and shit
Fuck it tho I ain't got time for this shit

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
1090 'til my time go
Shoot on sight won't be no combo
Like Ibaka keep that 9 tho
Tony Parker, bitch I'm Rondo
I can't do no 9 to 5 no
Move that work just like I'm Alpo
I would never drop a dime tho
Put that on my nigga Quado
Fuck around and crack a shell I ain't talking snails treat a nigga like a lobster
If my nigga need that bail money I ain't got it then I'm playing cops and robbers
Put a nigga under
I ain't even fronting
Nigga I ain't stutter I'll fucking pop ya
Only time you hear a stutter when that choppa bust and it go ba-ba-ba-ba-blocka
On some real shit wanna know when the last I fucking cried nigga?
After niggas killed my bro Quo they just left him in the store to die nigga
That's the reason why my niggas carry heats and always keep it on the side nigga
King Ceazar, Trippy Rell with my nigga Flair YFN those (ha!!)

[Outro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & *King Ceazar*]
I ain't got time for this shit *(no, no)*
I don't even got time for my bitch *(no noo nooo)*
YFN in this bitch
*Yeah yeah*
*Let's go*
