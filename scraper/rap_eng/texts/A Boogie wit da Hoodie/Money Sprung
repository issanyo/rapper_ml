[Intro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Money sprung, money sprung

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Fuck it, I'm back with another one
Fuck it up and do another one
My niggas do not shoot dirty guns
Shoot it up and get another one
I keep on counting them hundreds up
I think I'm falling in love with 'em
I keep on counting them hundreds my nigga
I think that I'm money sprung
Money sprung, money sprung
My nigga, I think I'm money sprung
Money sprung, money sprung
My nigga, I think I'm money sprung
I keep on counting them hundreds up
I think I'm falling in love with 'em
I keep on counting them hundreds my nigga
I think that I'm money sprung

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Track after track and another one
Know that's a hit, they can't fuck with 'em
Nigga, you don't gotta like me to understand where I'm coming from
I know you would eat it, what's up
Come chew on the dick like a bubble gum
Told herself to be the plug
Now everybody wanna fuck with her
Everybody need love, everybody need drugs
Nobody wanna be a dub
Every fit I put on probably cost me like a dub
I'm way too up, they can't keep up, yeah, yeah
I'm way too stuffed, I faced two cups, yeah, yeah
My new chain it look like a puck
My nigga, I'm icy as fuck, yeah, yeah
I feel like the King of New York
My jeweler is better than yours, yeah, yeah
A hundred sitting on my neck
Another hundred on the arm, yeah, yeah
I put the city on my back
How can I ever go wrong? Yeah, yeah
I don't need no groupie love
Go holla at my nigga Don (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I put my number in your phone
Just DM me if it was wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I told her my name is Artist
Now she wanna call me Arty
Telling me about a party, told her, "I'm the one performing"
Fuck it up before the party started

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Fuck it, I'm back with another one
Fuck it up and do another one
My niggas do not shoot dirty guns
Shoot it up and get another one
I keep on counting them hundreds up
I think I'm falling in love with 'em
I keep on counting them hundreds my nigga
I think that I'm money sprung
Money sprung, money sprung
My nigga, I think I'm money sprung
Money sprung, money sprung
My nigga, I think I'm money sprung
I keep on counting them hundreds up
I think I'm falling in love with 'em
I keep on counting them hundreds my nigga
I think that I'm money sprung

[Verse 2: Don Q]
I'm ahead of the race, flooring the gas
I'm passing the cops that I lead on a chase
If they come find out this weapon I placed
They might just give me a federal case
All of my folks has a residue taste
Rollie presidential when that presidential
Counting blue strips with the president face
I got the votes, don't you ever debate
Yeah, yeah, I got a chef at the crib
Little hoe, I don't never do dates
Yeah, yeah we are not looking for friends
So ain't no competitors safe
Yeah, yeah, five in the morning
I'm drinking on dirty, it's never too late
Yeah, yeah, leaving the spot
Had to switch up the whip, they was checking the plates
I'm still a menace
I do what I say and I won't give a fuck if you feel offended
You selling your soul just to get attention
I crept with a pole 'cause I feel the tension
Trappers, they love me, they throw on that Don
They get on that road with a pigeon in it
Little bitch you know me, I'm really the Don
I don't gotta try hard to fit the image
Look at my cup, it's Dirty Diana
I dropped two bananas and shook up the Fanta
Booked in Atlanta
I go to the club with the paper and I throw a book on the dancer
I am the one they was counting out
Now I get hundreds and count it out
Designer shit, they can't pronounce it
I'm styling out, they tryna spell it and sound it out
Yeah, yeah
