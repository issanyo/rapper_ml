[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I got a trash bag full of cash, yeah yeah
I got my racks so I'm not even mad, yeah yeah
Get the dice, nigga we can bet on it
I got so much hunnids I could make steps on it
I switch the swag all up in my bag, yeah yeah
I got my racks so I'm not even mad, yeah yeah
Diamonds dancing on my neck, I had to flex on 'em
Pussy so good, I spent the check on it

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
I got my cash up, got my racks up
All these bitches on me, I'm like "hoe, back up"
Where yo ass was at when I was broke?
Now you want my D because I got it for the low
I got cash now, niggas mad now
I just laugh now, cause I'm the man now
Niggas play y'all, til we spray off
Then we fade off, send 'em to the graveyard
Diamonds on my neck
I had to flex, I had to flex yeah
Bitches on my dick
Cause all these bitches know I'm next yeah
I just fucked a nigga's baby mama
Cause she know a nigga got them commas, yeah

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I got a trash bag full of cash, yeah yeah
I got my racks so I'm not even mad, yeah yeah
Get the dice, nigga we can bet on it
I got so much hunnids I could make steps on it
I switch the swag all up in my bag, yeah yeah
I got my racks so I'm not even mad, yeah yeah
Diamonds dancing on my neck, I had to flex on 'em
Pussy so good, I spent the check on it

[Bridge: PnB Rock]
Yeah, chasin' money
I been chasin' hunnids for a minute
I been gettin' it
I was broke but now I'm livin'
Yeah they love me, all these bitches
Cause these singles fuckin' comin' now
Didn't give me the pussy back then
I don't want it now

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
I been flexin' hard, on the regular
My belt is Goyard, ballin' no point guard
All LA bad bitches in my bed now
Fuckin' with that coca and whole bottles to the face now
Fuck a nigga's bitch and ask her how she like it
She tried to say she love it but was too excited
Smokin' by the zip, pass me a fuckin' lighter
We got a crib full of pounds so we don't get indited, yeah

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I got a trash bag full of cash, yeah yeah
I got my racks so I'm not even mad, yeah yeah
Get the dice, nigga we can bet on it
I got so much hunnids I could make steps on it
I switch the swag all up in my bag, yeah yeah
I got my racks so I'm not even mad, yeah yeah
Diamonds dancing on my neck, I had to flex on 'em
Pussy so good, I spent the check on it
