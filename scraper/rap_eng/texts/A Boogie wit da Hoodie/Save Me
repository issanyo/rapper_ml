[Intro: Nun]
This figure is crazy, yeah
One time, for my niggas doing one time
One time, for my niggas duckin' one time

[Hook: Nun]
Yeah, real shit nigga, no
Somebody save me, save me
In and out of jail I hope that y'all don't hate me
Oh, baby momma creepin' almost drove me crazy
I showed her everything she know, how could she play me
Somebody save me, save me
When I get that bag I hope they don't betray me
Yeah, they talk alike some killas that don't phase me [?]
I swear I never leave the crib without my 80

[Verse 1: Nun]
I fell in love with the swipes, I made a hundred thou'
When I copped my M5 I was running wild
I was speeding through the toles doing 200 miles
Then I look up in the sky, then see my mama smile
Somebody save me, save me
Cancer took my mom it drove me crazy
All this fucking pain really made me
I never thought it could but then it changed me
And now she talking child support, she must be fucking bugging
For all of that I should of went and fucked her cousin
Threating my freedom and I know she fucking bluffing
I could have a hundred bitches on her like its nothing
I can't fuck with bitches got me thinking different
Tryna catch me slipping when they know I'm in my feelings
And when I catch that nigga who killed my niggas I'm gon' kill him
Make sure everybody in his family fucking feel it
I sit alone in a room I'm thinking 'bout Dust
And I pray he make it home, all we got is us
Seen my mans turn snake I don't who to trust
And I know he with the feds ain't no fooling us

[Hook: Nun]
I said one time for my niggas doing one time
Yeah, one time for my niggas ducking one time
One time for my niggas still on the grind
One time for my nigga doing one time
One time for my niggas doing one time
One time for my nigga ducking one time
One time for my niggas still on the grind
One time for my niggas doing one time


[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I fell in love with the music I made 200 thousand
In a week, my first time seeing 200 thousand
I couldn't sleep, was on my grind, yeah I'm so fucking timeless
Still playing in them streets, gotta be fucking conscious
They tried to murder, murder, me and all my niggas with that burner
Just know we coming back, my nigga word up
Tryna touch my chain, bitch I'm gon' turn up
Posted up in M.I.A, right on fucking Collins
In a drop so you could see that I ain't fucking smiling
Hit the drop and come and see me, yeah that draco childish
If I start to go crazy, they gon' think I'm wilding
They call it murder, murder
Cause we ain't going out like that, yeah word up
We gon' do it first before they murk us
Bitches that was curvin' don't deserve us
I can't trust no bitch you must be fucking tripping
When you looking at that bag the only time they listen
Sometimes I wanna touch my stash but I be fucking tripping
Sometimes I get up in my bag and I be reminiscing
I wanna murder, murder
Yeah, all I see is murder
