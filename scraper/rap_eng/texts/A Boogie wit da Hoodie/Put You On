[Intro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Lil Yachty]
30, you a fool for this one
I could put you on
Girl, you know that I could put you on
30, you a motherfucking fool, nigga

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I could put you on
Girl, you know that I could put you on
Don't be acting like I did you wrong, yeah
Yeah, I want you but I took too long

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I know you heard this about a thousand times
I'll tell you one more time, "you're beautiful"
I hope you don't let nobody touch your phone
I'm sending dick pics to you all night long
I know you tired of being all alone, yeah
He said he love you, girl you know he don't
And stop acting like you know me though
'Cause if you know me, you won't come too close
Yeah, 'cause I break hearts on the regular
I am not a rapper, I'm a artist
I ain't regular
Zippers on my jacket, new Givenchy
And that's regular
I switch up on all the newest cars and that's regular
I got all of these VVS diamonds and I'm rich as fuck
I could let you pick out any bag in particular
You gon' let me bust all on yo ass when I beat it up
Whenever you ready to be nasty, just hit me up
I'ma fuck you all night, call me daddy
I'ma put you on

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & PnB Rock]
I could put you on
Girl, you know that I could put you on
Don't be acting like I did you wrong, yeah (acting like I did you wrong)
Yeah, I want you but I took too long (yeah, but you took too long)
I could put you on
Girl, you know that I could put you on
Don't be acting like I did you wrong, yeah (acting like I did you wrong)
Yeah, I want you but I took too long (want you but you took too long, oh yeah)

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Why you keep on fucking with these lame niggas? (lame)
They just do you wrong and play them games witchu (game)
I could put you on and get some change witchu (change)
Cut the top off the roof, I'm switching lanes witchu (skrrt)
Yeah, you know that you my favorite, my favorite
Put them VV's in yo tennis bracelet, bracelet
Fur coats for the winter time, Nobu when it's dinner time
You know we ain't gotta stand in line
Let me put you on, let me make you mine
Yeah
Through the good times, through the bad times
Girl I'm all you need
If you stressed out, if you need help
You can call on me
When you be throwing that shit back, you put it all on me
I got you scratching on my neck when I be going so deep

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & PnB Rock]
I could put you on (put you on)
Girl, you know that I could put you on (you know that I could put you on)
Don't be acting like I did you wrong, yeah (don't be acting like I did you wrong)
Yeah, I want you but I took too long (want you but you took too long, oh yeah)
I could put you on (I could put you on)
Girl, you know that I could put you on (girl, you know that I could put you on)
Don't be acting like I did you wrong, yeah (don't be acting like I did you wrong)
Yeah, I want you but I took too long (want you but you took too long, yeah)

[Outro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I could put you on
Girl, you know that I could put you on
Don't be acting like I did you wrong, yeah
Yeah, I want you but I took too long
