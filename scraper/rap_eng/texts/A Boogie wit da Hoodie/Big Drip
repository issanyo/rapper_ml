[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I got big drip so I watch the way I move, yeah
Wrist costs a milly, half a ticket on my shoes, yeah
I got big drip so I, I got big drip so I
Straight out the dungeon, ooh-ooh
Straight out the dungeon, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Yung Bleu]
Straight out the dungeon, the dungeon, the dungeon
You better run run, run run run, run run run
Extensions on the gun gun, gun gun gun
Extensions on the gun gun, gun gun gun
Blocka-blocka-blocka
Pussy nigga poppa
You don't want no drama
We don't want no drama
Like a pimp I got big drip and a stick shift
I got bitches on my tip tip make it drip drip
Catch me walkin' like a crip, I be fuckin' like a pimp
And I'm walkin' with a limp, I ain't fuckin' with no shrimp

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I got big drip so I watch the way I move, yeah
Wrist costs a milly, half a ticket on my shows, yeah
I got big drip so I, I got big drip so I
Straight out the dungeon, ooh-ooh
Straight out the dungeon, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Gettin' money on an off day, yeah
'Member sittin' in them hallways, yeah
Ever since I got some Balmains, yeah
I bought every pair of Balmains, yeah
And I gotta keep at least two or three toasters
I don't want to be the one to get slumped over
All my enemies want to be just like us
I don't want to be the one to tell 'em it's over
All my old bitches sick, they wanna be rivals
'Cause I never gave 'em a ring and told 'em that I do
Bitch I got big drip, I got all the nice Loubs
Red bottoms every time a nigga walk by you

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I got big drip so I watch the way I move, yeah
Wrist costs a milly, half a ticket on my shows, yeah
I got big drip so I, I got big drip so I
Straight out the dungeon, ooh-ooh
Straight out the dungeon, ooh-ooh
