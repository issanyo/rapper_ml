[Intro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I know you been needing somebody
Mustard on the beat, ho!
Look, I know you been needing somebody
Nobody really got me like I got me
Just tell me what you really want from me
It's no problem, I'ma go see if I got it
Just tell me what you really want from me
What you really want?

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Look, I know you been needing somebody
Nobody really got me like I got me
Just tell me what you really want from me
It's no problem, I'ma go see if I got it
If I got it, then you got it it's no problem
Hoes plotting, thinking that we don't know 'bout 'em
I wonder what the fuck they want from me
I know that you been needing somebody

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I know your head sloppy
You really do it like you care about me
Avianne got me feeling like I'm playing hockey
Rap money got me pulling up in big bodies
Big bodies little niggas don't know shit about me
Call me Artie I love to party, shooters beside me
Left the Rari' inside the parking lot oh I'm sorry
Ended up with a Spanish mami calling me papi
Acting cocky when she really don't know shit about me
Though they wonder why I always got my clique by me
Don't touch me, you'll be lucky if you sit by me
They don't get it 'til they really see their bitch by me
Got a trophy on my arm, I keep my wrist icy
If you want it, nigga, then you gotta get by me
Always wanted a Patek, now I can get like three
If you think it's too late, then it just might be

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Look, I know you been needing somebody
Nobody really got me like I got me
Just tell me what you really want from me
It's no problem, I'ma go see if I got it
If I got it, then you got it it's no problem
Hoes plotting, thinking that we don't know 'bout 'em
I wonder what the fuck they want from me
I know that you been needing somebody

[Verse 2: Don Q]
We can get it popping for the night though
You know my style, red bottoms, only the spikes though
Yeah, it's always a light show whenever the ice glow
Couple more shots, ain't no tellin' where we might go
Take it to Marriot or, we can take it to the trap
Spittin' on my mic, shoulda put her on the track
Fuck around and have you butt naked on my Snap
With your legs on the air, got you shakin' on your back like
Wait, I think she catchin' a seizure
All my old hoes tell me I'm catchin' amnesia
A different kind of beast, I'm not a regular creature
Drop two-seater beamer, cranberry its features

[Bridge: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
What they really want from the nigga?
What you really want?
What the fuck they really want from a nigga?

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I know you been needing somebody
Nobody really got me like I got me
Just tell me what you really want from me
It's no problem, I'ma go see if I got it
If I got it, then you got it it's no problem
Hoes plotting, thinking that we don't know 'bout 'em
I wonder what the fuck they want from me
I know that you been needing somebody
