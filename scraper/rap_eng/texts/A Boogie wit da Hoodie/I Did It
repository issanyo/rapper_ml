[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
I can't trust these bitches
I don’t got no feelings
Wondering why I ain't got no feelings
And the coupe too deep, it ain't got no ceiling, nah
But I admit I did it
Fucked on your sister and you know I did it
Fucked on your friend and you know I did it
I’m the savage or a dog, it don't make no difference, ah

[Verse 1]
But I'm a rockstar nigga
Guitar smashin' ass, top chart nigga
Different currency around the world, I get it
Eliantte diamonds around all my niggas
Eliantte diamonds around all my niggas
It's because of you, yeah, all the drugs I did
Mix it in the Fanta, yeah, the mud, I did it
Sendin' me a message, yeah she know I read it, yeah
Yeah, you know I read it
And you know 'bout everything that I did
And you always got your phone on silent
So I keep the forty right beside me
Bad vibe when I close my eyes, yeah
Like X, put it on my eyelids
Like X, nigga, I'ma die rich
My ex wanna be my side bitch

[Chorus]
I can’t trust these bitches
I don’t got no feelings (Uh)
Wondering why I ain't got no feelings
And the coupe too deep, it ain’t got no ceiling, nah (Yeah)
But I admit I did it (Yeah)
Fucked on your sister and you know I did it
Fucked on your friend and you know I did it (Yeah)
I'm the savage or a dog, it don't make no difference, ah

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'm a rockstar, aren’t you?
You are anything I say you are, aren't you?
And you belong to me until I say you don't, as long as you
Don't give my company away, I swear to God I fuck with you, yeah
I hope you fuck with me, yeah
I fuck with you, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Ride my wave until you can't go further
Ride my wave until you can't go further
Stay so busy so I know you're workin'
You're just like me, girl, you're all over
You're just like me, girl, I swear you're perfect
Every girl just wanna feel important
Every curve, the way your body swervin'
All your curves, the way your body swervin', yeah

[Chorus]
I can't trust no bitches
No bitches, yeah yeah
I don't got no feelings
Wondering why I ain't got no feelings
And the coupe too deep, it ain't got no ceiling, nah (Ceiling, yeah)
But I admit I did it (I did it)
Fucked on your sister and you know I did it (I did it)
Fucked on your friend and you know I did it (I did it)
I'm the savage or a dog, it don't make no difference, ah

[Outro]
I don't even got no feelings
Somehow you just make me nervous
Baby, that's one in a million
Make me feel this pill stop workin'
I been playin' 'round with fire
For some reason, it still won't burn, yeah
I fuck with you, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
I fuck with you, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
I fuck with you, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
I can't trust these bitches
