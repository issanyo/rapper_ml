[Intro: Trap Manny]
Yeah, huh (Yeah)
Chris Ro$e gon' be the reason we gon' blow, ooh

[Chorus: Trap Manny]
There's a difference between bosses and workers
I'm in the mountains, I can't get no service
Just walked in to patron and made me a purchase
Fuck the pussy, want the head like a turban
It's one thing for sure and it's two things for certain
Carry that nine on me like it's a Birkin
I won't go in the club if I know that they searchin'
I love the attention, I took off the curtains

[Verse 1: Don Q]
I love the attention, I wanna get spotted
She love a nigga that's stuntin', I got it
But she want a nigga that come and divide it (What?)
I'm thinkin' and I'ma decide it (I'm thinkin' and I'ma decide it)
Since when I come out of pocket for bitches
I been knew were runnin' 'round thottin'? (Thot)
20K with me and I was just shoppin' (Shop)
If it get slippery, I'm pickin' cotton
Trap in the A with me, we just hit Onyx (Hit Onyx)
He down to spurt with me, that's my accomplice (My accomplice)
Please don't harrass me, whatever you ask me
Just watch what you say to me, I'm too iconic (Just watch what you say)
I fucked this lil' baddie, she callin' me daddy
Now she tryna stay with me like she adopted (She callin' me daddy)
Tryna record when you lay with me
Lil' bitch, you better not play with me
Ho, be reminded (Yeah yeah yeah)
(What kind of movie you did?)
I just made a horror flick, me and Blac Chyna was star in it
(And what you gon' do at the Grammys?)
Ferrar' at the Grammys, I roll up and light my cigar in it (Yeah)
My wrist cotton candy, got whips like a carnival
She get amused when I'm parkin' it (Hah)
A nigga so fancy, I cut all the bargaining
Fuck it, I Louis-ed the cardigan
I bought all this jewelry from marketing, yeah
I know I'm the one that they targeting, yeah
It never bothered 'em
I see the way that we move just needed some sharpening, yeah
Ain't no more borrowing
Nigga, I paid for my jewels, my water be sparklin', yeah
Who tryna spar with him?
I go rockstar on 'em, hop out and break the guitar on 'em, yeah

[Chorus: Trap Manny]
There's a difference between bosses and workers
I'm in the mountains, I can't get no service
Just walked in to patron and made me a purchase
Fuck the pussy, want the head like a turban
It's one thing for sure and it's two things for certain
Carry that nine on me like it's a Birkin
I won't go in the club if I know that they searchin'
I love the attention, I took off the curtains

[Verse 2: Trap Manny]
Just a couple young niggas defyin' the odds
Probably ain't think we'd make it this far
Walk in the bank, tell the teller withdrawal
I just want blue crispy hundreds, that's all
I want that coupe that's two hundred or more
Hit the gas, watch it leap like a frog
Sippin' drink, my double cup full of raw
Double C's, hoppin' out the double R

[Verse 3: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
No feelings involved, just want it all
Switched up the cars, no rented cars
Fuck up charge, get off my balls
Money involved, give the lawyer a call
All of my broads ain't really mine
They could be yours, nigga, who knows?
Got mama a crib, three car garage
She don't even drive but she on the go
I run it up, straight out the mud
I got a job, I'm not a fraud
When I'm in the mall they think I'm a scammer
Punchin' it up like uppercuts
These niggas is Sherm, make me wanna uptight
Just give me the word, back up, I'm gone
If you want the bird, trap in the trap
I front you the work, I'm down as a don
But I need it back, mmh
And I cannot fuck with no ratatouille, that's a fact
I can't fuck with no rat, mmh
Niggas start talkin' too crazy
All over my nine, I'm hangin' my jack, mmh
I got a bitch out in Cali
Not even my bitch but she just got me tattooed
I don't deserve her
I swear to God, there's a difference between bosses and workers

[Chorus: Trap Manny]
There's a difference between bosses and workers
I'm in the mountains, I can't get no service
Just walked in to patron and made me a purchase
Fuck the pussy, want the head like a turban
It's one thing for sure and it's two things for certain
Carry that nine on me like it's a Birkin
I won't go in the club if I know that they searchin'
I love the attention, I took off the curtains
