I got the bag on me, uh, I got the bag on me now, uh
I got the bag on me, uh, I keep the bag on me now, uh
I got the bag on me, uh, I got the bag on me now, uh
I got the bag on me, uh, I keep a bag on me now

[Pre-Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
They want to run down on me
When they see me them niggas is mad at me
So I walk around with it
Cause they plottin' and I keep that bag on me
I was a clown to them hatin' niggas
Yeah they used to laugh at me
Now I got to hold it down
Case a nigga feel like he want to come after me

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
'Cause I got that bag on me, yeah I got that bag on me
I got that bag on me, yeah I keep that bag on me
They want to run down on me
When they see me them niggas is mad at me
So I walk around with it
'Cause they plottin' and I keep that bag on me

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Double R's what we ridin'
Highbridge spelt in diamonds
Fell in love with designer
Then I fell in love with Rihanna
All I hang around is shottas
They'll never ever tell your honor
Nina have em singin', Na-Na-Na-Nuh
We can meet up anywhere you wanna
Run it up, I run it up again
She was frontin' so I fucked her friend
Bitches callin' me a dog because
I dont wanna fall in love with them
You could call it what you wanted cause
She gon' still let me fuck again
I'ma keep on countin' hundreds so
We don't fuck with you Washingtons
They just want to see me starve again
Reason why I'm goin' hard again
Missed my target so I shot again
Missed my ex so I shot again
You a dub, you is not a ten
Just the money, I don't got a friend
Told my hitter shoot, he shot at them
Left a nigga in the garbage bin
Now I got that bag fuck that shit I never had
Cause I'm going in for that shit
And I never laugh at a nigga if he doing bad
Cause nigga I been through that shit
But I'm in my bag, yeah my nigga, I'm in my bag
But I think you been knew that shit
How I make a track, and I'm making niggas mad
And I know they ain't doin shit

[Pre-Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
They want to run down on me
When they see me them niggas is mad at me
So I walk around with it
'Cause they plottin' and I keep that bag on me
I was a clown to them hatin' niggas
Yeah they used to laugh at me
Now I got to hold it down
Case a nigga feel like he want to come after me

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
'Cause I got that bag on me, yeah I got that bag on me
I got that bag on me, yeah I keep that bag on me
They want to run down on me
When they see me them niggas is mad at me
So I walk around with it
'Cause they plottin' and I keep that bag on me

[Verse 2: Don Q]
Dreamt about it, then we went and did it
Double-R's, we was really in it
Pullin' up and they be in they feelings
It was all good when we was in the Civic
Sick jewels make your bitch choose
They all stare when the wrist move
And it all came from that raw cane
In the kitchen with the wrist moves
Give a fuck about your rap deal
I could show you how the cash feel
Run it up until the bags fill
Safe spot, keep stash sealed
Money money, I don't sleep without it
Couple hundreds, I don't leave without it
All my niggas got to keep it solid
Then if not then I don't want to be around it
Now my bitch bad, got a C around it
I just took my neck and put a key around it
Money piling, I can't see around it
So the pocket rockets, got to keep around it
We couldn't just settle, my foot on the pedal
I come in Hell's Kitchen and cook with the devil
I'm good in the ghetto, for real nigga
I be in the trenches with the night riders
And the pack pushers and the white buyers
I'm like Mike Myers with a knife by him
I could bring it to you but the price higher
Bust down, make the ice brighter
We ain't really on sight typers
We the serve you on sight type of
Give it to you in a white Viper

[Pre-Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
They want to run down on me
When they see me them niggas is mad at me
So I walk around with it
'Cause they plottin' and I keep that bag on me
I was a clown to them hatin' niggas
Yeah they used to laugh at me
Now I got to hold it down
Case a nigga feel like he want to come after me

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
'Cause I got that bag on me, yeah I got that bag on me
I got that bag on me, yeah I keep that bag on me
They want to run down on me
When they see me them niggas is mad at me
So I walk around with it
'Cause they plottin' and I keep that bag on me
