(Intro)
I've been playing it so long n****

(Hook FATBOY IZZO (A Boogie wit the Hoodie))
I've been playing it so long n****
Goddamn singing the same song n****'s
Strap little writing this on my own n****
If you coming n**** come in come on n****
(And i've been writing since a little n****
Yea high mind just got a little quicker
Same guy Stackz just got a little thicker
Bang ha if you coming come on n****
Come on come on n****)

(Verse 1 Jaquae)
Ooo Wee! when I ain't had no money it got real lonely
Since i've been getting to it everybody know me
Had to hit the field had to get it OT
Now I gettin' all this bread my shooters keep it toasty
Paranoid n**** I think they onto me
Money stacks to thick can't even hold this s***
You talkin' loose out your mouth my n**** holdin' grill
Make you disappear on some rude magician's i'll show em tricks
I'm ballin'
When I walk in
On my way in feelin' like i'm all in
You see it
I mean it
Everything is sittin' word to my pieces'
Got the bag that's facts
Young n**** all up in that trap
Only pray for better days
I'm about a dollar I gotta get paid

(Hook FATBOY IZZO (A Boogie wit the Hoodie))
I've been playing it so long n****
Goddamn singing the same song n****'s
Strap little writing this on my own n****
If you coming n**** come in come on n****
(And i've been writing since a little n****
Yea high mind just got a little quicker
Same guy Stackz just got a little thicker
Bang ha if you coming come on n****
Come on come on n****)

(Verse 2 FATBOY IZZO)
Let me remind em all what kind of time
Rolex on AMG 50 recline
To move away with this big weight coming from dimes
You see this s*** n**** bright light city in mind
They callin' shots yeah bet they ears know they be buggin'
They talkin' game on this big game know that they wasn't
You see these b****'s these bad b****'s yeah they be cluckin'
They love this s*** yeah seeing n**** coming from nothin'
I done banged out nights for many reasons
P**** n****'s seeing they (?)
Broke n****'s seeing they palms see the (?)
Hatin' n****'s stickin' they low but really sleepin'
An eye for an eye m*********** nothin' less no other n****
Grind for this butter no disrespect no other n****
Grind for each other cut the deck know what it means to
Tag you as my brother nothin' less
