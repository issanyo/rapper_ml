[Intro]
They ain't really down to ride like me

[Hook:A Boogie With Da Hoodie]
I ain't worry cause I know nobody got me the way I got me
And I got me I got me nigga
By my lonely cause I  know nobody really down to ride like me
They not like me not like me nigga
I ain't worry cause I know nobody got me the way I got me
And I got me I got me nigga
By my lonely cause I know nobody really down to ride like me
They not like me not like me nigga

[Verse 1: Snoopy Dinero]
Yeah a nigga always up
It's about seven in morning
Gotta get it gotta go
Ain't no sleeping ain't no yawning
Grab that gun before you go
You don't want yo sister moaning
You don't want yo mama crying
You don't want yo brothes dying
Man these bitches always lying
I could never get the truth
And I rap bout what I feel
That's why I gotta hit the booth
Real recognize real so real gon' salute
Don't be beastin' for no gun if you know you ain't gon'  shoot(huh)
Man you know you ain't gon' bust
Who the fuck is you gon' trust (who the fuck is you gon' trust)
When your back is against the wall and your screaming
Fuck them all
Or you locked down in that cell and that judge don't give you bail
And the moment start to spread man they think you gon tell
I could never be them
If I even see them (If I ever see them)
Grab my gun and  freeze them
Send them to them demons(Send them to the demons)
Cock it back and shoot again
Be yo demon fuck a friend
This right here is for my brothers that ain't  get to see the end

[Hook]
I ain't worry cause I know nobody got me the way I got me
And I got me I got me nigga
By my lonely cause I know nobody really down to ride like me
They not like not like me nigga
Ya not like me not like me
Not like me nigga
Ya not like me want a check I'm not Nike nigga

[Verse 2:Snoopy Dinero]
If you don't know now you know
Been that nigga since the go
Man I started from the bottom
I done came up from the floor
I was giving out deals
Tryna' build myself afloat
First they start you out with weed
Then you graduate to snow
If you don't know now you know
Been that nigga since the start
Bitches tryna' steal my heart so they can ripe that shit apart
Niggas wanna be the boss
Nobody  wanna play they part
I can do it on my own
You ain't gotta play ya part
But don't say that you helped me
Don't say you was gon' tell me anything
I'm moving on to bigger and better things
Stack it to the ceiling
Getting out my feelings
Imma' make it to the top
God willing

[Hook: A Boogie With Da Hoodie]
I ain't worry cause I know nobody got me the way I got me
And I got me I got me nigga
By my lonely cause I know nobody really down to ride like me
They not like not like me nigga
I ain't worry cause I know nobody got me the way I got me
And I got me I got me nigga
By my lonely cause I know nobody really down to ride like me
They not like me not like me nigga

[Outro]
I ain't worry cause I know nobody got me the way I got me
( I got me x4 )
By my lonely cause I know nobody really down to ride like me
(Ride like me x14)
