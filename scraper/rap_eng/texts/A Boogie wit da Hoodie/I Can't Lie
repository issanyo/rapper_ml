[Intro: Don Q]
Yeah
I don't know what else to tell you niggas
It's gettin' spooky and scarier, I'll tell you that, though
All I see is red
Don

[Verse 1: Don Q]
When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It make no sense, goin' to heaven tryna stay with Christ
I got more addicted to drinkin' syrup and playin' dice
The way of life, the hood is full of choices, nigga, pick your poison (poison)
Her only son, I couldn't leave my momma disappointed
We had that work for times when we couldn't get employment
You know we servin' 'til the coppers call in reinforcements
We in too deep to be throwin' white flags (white flags)
Lookin' at the rear-view mirror while my life pass (life pass)
No more beefin' with niggas, we sendin' price tags (price)
Twenty thousand on your head, that's a light tag (nothin')
Niggas in my circle ain't think I was good enough (good)
I leaped over ever hurdle they was puttin' up
Do your research and look me up, it's real coke in front of you
Rip the plastic and get your gas mask before you cook me up

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I, yeah
I can't lie-ah
I'm that guy-ah
I don't try-ah
I'm on fire

[Verse 2: Don Q]
The book of life, you can't skim through a page
Ain't gotta witness the rage when the venom engage
Minimum wage was the reason for the criminal ways (criminal ways)
Killin' for days only makin' your adrenaline raise
Nigga behave, survival how we mentally raised
I never expire, walk through the fire, sittin' ablaze
I'm prayin' for my enemies, I hope my enemies pray (hope my enemies)
And any innocent bystander that get in the way, yeah

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Yeah, now you wanna act like you know me
Back in the G, that was the old me
Always stay true to the homies
Some dead, some of them parolees
In the feds screamin' "fuck a co-d"
I been gettin' bread stayin' lowkey
Tryna stay away from the Codeine
Tryna stay away from the police
Swear these fuck niggas can't hold me
Always tryna say that we too deep
Bitch, I'm buyin' chains for the whole team
I just bought a Wraith and it's odee
In and out of state gettin' more green
Came a long way from the stolies
Swear these fuck niggas can't hold me

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I can't switch sides
I'm gon' ride, I
I'm that guy-ah
I'm on fire
