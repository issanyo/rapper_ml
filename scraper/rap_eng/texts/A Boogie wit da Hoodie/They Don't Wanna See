[Intro: QP (Highbridge CO-Founder)]
These niggas really don't wanna see us win
These niggas really don't wanna see us take over the streets
Niggas  don't wanna see us get to it
But that's what we gon' do
Highbridge the Label
A Boogie, Don Q, what's up?
My niggas here to take over the game, huh
Everybody sayin' they up next, who really up next?
This is Volume One
Don, talk to these niggas

[Hook: Don Q]
They don't wanna see you grindin'
They don't wanna see you shinin'
They don't wanna see the diamonds
They don't wanna see you ridin'
They don't wanna see you pull up foreign with a bunch of foreigns right behind you
They don't wanna see you pull up foreign with a foreign bitch right inside it

[Verse 1: Don Q]
All I know is get the Gwala nigga
It's like 20 thousand in designer nigga
All I know you gotta move milly cause these stupid bitches wanna line a nigga
Niggas know just how we get around
A couple pistols in the Sprinter now
Ruth Chris for my dinner now
That money coming by the minute now
All I ever talk is fishscale
My neck and my wrist is a brick sale
I hope in that Bent and I fishtail
30 clip look like a pig tail
I was broke now my pockets look heavy now
Got that money so we buy whatever now
I was sick, caught a cold off the weather now
Bought a pint of that drink, I feel better now
I do this for pop, I can't let him down
I do this for Quo, I can't let him down
I spent a stack on my sweater now
I just kick back in Margielas now
Never ever tell the people nothing
Gotta be 100, gotta keep it coming
First I thumb through it
Then I run through it
Dirty shoebox where I keep the hundreds nigga

[Hook: Don Q]
They don't wanna see you grindin'
They don't wanna see you shinin'
They don't wanna see the diamonds
They don't wanna see you ridin'
They don't wanna see you pull up foreign with a bunch of foreigns right behind you
They don't wanna see you pull up foreign with a foreign bitch right inside it

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I had that pack in my Tommy drawers
Fuck am I lying for? Nigga I want it all
Ain't a killer, don't push me, I promise
I got a pocket rocket, I let that gun go off
From the jungle where niggas get caught up in rumbles
Then come back and knock on your mama's door
I used to wear cheap shit my nigga
The fuck you think I go so hard for designer for?
Perc poppin', lean sippin' nigga
Jeans, 1,350 and my
Tee cost 350, this is
Avianne on me, 50 nigga
They don't wanna see me winning nigga
Hated on us but we did it nigga
They don't wanna see that Bentley cause we
Taking nigga's bitches while we in 'em
I ran a check up on Balmain
Walked in and bought the whole thing
Fuck it up with my whole gang
I can't remember my ho's name
I never tell 'em my whole name
Always want to know things
See him shining in them gold chains
Double-R's cover both lanes

[Hook: Don Q]
They don't wanna see you grindin'
They don't wanna see you shinin'
They don't wanna see the diamonds
They don't wanna see you ridin'
They don't wanna see you pull up foreign with a bunch of foreigns right behind you
They don't wanna see you pull up foreign with a foreign bitch right inside it
