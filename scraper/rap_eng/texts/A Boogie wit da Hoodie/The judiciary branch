The judiciary is up to me
The branches need some company
I’m like can we get some company
I’m like damn we’re really undefeated
Courts courts courts
Supreme courts courts
Nine appointed judges of supreme court bench
The president picks them out but the senate votes them in
They decide if the laws of our land are still fair
They’re the court of last resort; the final interpreter
Which branch of government interprets the law
What is this branch of the government called
The judiciary branch
The judiciary branch
