[Intro: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I just spent 80 on a AP
Tell lil' baby she can love me or she hate me
In the brand new McLaren, and I'm racing
With the gang and you know how outer space be

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?
Love it or you hate it, how you like that, uh?
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
How you like the glis'? How you like my wrist?
How you like these diamonds dancing in my fucking fist?
How you like that, how you like that?
If she hit my jack, I hit her right back
'Cause I'm out the way, bitch I'm MIA
Don't stand in my way, posted in the A
Find out where you lay, open up the gates
I won't leave a trace, not try'na catch a case, yeah
You's a open mind, you's a big stain, yeah
You's a poopy butt, yeah you's a shit stain, yeah
Posted in the bando with the big gang, yeah
Totin' sticks and extendos with the big bang, yeah
All headshots, I won't make your body count
With the big chop, try'na see your body bounce
Pack o' lions, I ain't try'na see nobody pounce
Got a kilo round my neck, we weigh it by the pound, yeah

[Bridge: Trippie Redd]
You can't see me, you can't be me
Did you get that? Did you get that?
Did you like that? How you like that?

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I just spent 80 on a AP
Tell lil' baby she can love me or she hate me
In the brand new McLaren, and I'm racing
With the gang and you know how outer space be

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?
Love it or you hate it, how you like that, uh?
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Walk around, Dior Hommes on me
Studio, I got poles on me
Perc 30, got my nose runnin'
Chiraq got me cold hearted
I be with killers, they got no conscience
41M, I put stones on it
Lawyer money, spend a cool hundred
On the set, I put a cool hundred
Just for talkin', niggas move from me
A couple bitches I done soon fucked
Pay for pussy, boy, that's shoe money
My young niggas, they gon' shoot some
Caught a case, I couldn't bust nuts
Run up on me, you a dumb fuck
Shooters hangin' out of Putt-Putt
All these niggas know what's up

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I just spent 80 on a AP
Tell lil' baby she can love me or she hate me
In the brand new McLaren, and I'm racing
With the gang and you know how outer space be

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?
Love it or you hate it, how you like that, uh?
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I just spent like 80 on a bracelet
Fuck 20 on a chain I tried to take his
Couple Highbridge niggas on that same shit
Take the red pill or the blue pill like the matrix
Run it up then spend it all or burnt it off, yeah
Just hit me up, I'm a beat it up like aw yeah
When I pick you up I'm a eat you up in my car yeah
With my chains on I feel like a rockstar yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I just spent 80 on a AP
Tell lil' baby she can love me or she hate me
In the brand new McLaren, and I'm racing
With the gang and you know how outer space be

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?
