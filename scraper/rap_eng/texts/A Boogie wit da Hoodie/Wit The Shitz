[Hook: Billionaire Black]
You say you a trapper you ain't moving bricks
You say you a killer you ain't killing shit

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
You say with the shits

If this brick on me ain't adding up what I paid

And if this bitch with me don't open up and give me brain
Nigga Ima send her back

Pour it up and then I sip it up
I'm leaning up feeling like I had a pill in that shit
Bitches only wanna fuck us cus we clouting up

Then say what up to you like it never happened
A boogie with the shits like a napkin

[Hook: Billionaire Black]
You say you a trapper you ain't moving bricks
