[Intro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Sorry Jaynari
Dave-O, mix me a slap

[Chorus: TeeJay3k]
I got all these bands on me, bands on me
Shawty please don't put your hands on me, hands on me
I got all these bands on me, bands on me
I got all these bands on me, all these bands on me
I got all these bands on me, bands on me
Shawty please don't put your hands on me, hands on me
I got all these bands on me, bands on me
I got all these bands on me, all these bands on me

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
I got all these bands, all these bands on me
I counted out a quota, they like damn whoadie
We really getting to it, that's for damn surely
We been really getting to it, that's for damn surely
My hooker hit for twenty then she ran on me
Don't get to reachin' for my chain, I'ma stamp homie
You know I keep that blam, keep that blam on me
We don't do no pump faking, my illas playing for keeps
Shoutout to my jeweler, all these grams on me
Mozzarella Dweller, eighty bands for him
These niggas makin' payments, they ain't paying for it
Had million dollar dreams, I've been praying for it
Two hundred MPH's on the dashboard
It's a different kind of paper when your bag foreign
Ayy, all that fake flexing, get you taxed for it
And then we blew it like it's nothing when we lash for it

[Chorus: TeeJay3k]
I got all these bands on me, bands on me
Shawty please don't put your hands on me, hands on me
I got all these bands on me, bands on me
I got all these bands on me, all these bands on me
I got all these bands on me, bands on me
Shawty please don't put your hands on me, hands on me
I got all these bands on me, bands on me
I got all these bands on me, all these bands on me

[Verse 2: Blac Youngsta]
Racks on me, racks on me (Stacks)
And it's on blood, I ain't going without my MAC on me (Strap)
And I got love for them bloods out in Sac' homie (Sac')
You pulled up clutching, know busting'll get you whacked homie
I'm just speaking facts homie
When them killers kick a door, know the procedure
When I'm down and I'm broke and really need you
Young nigga killing shit, kill for no reason
I'm just tryna get this money, take care my people
12 pulled me over in that Lam' for no seatbelt
Every time I pull up on my opps, they get detailed
All these fucking racks, all these fucking racks on me girl
I might throw some racks if you do that on your knees girl
Dance on me, dance on me
You look so good, I just wanna put my hands on you
It hurt my eyes when my homie took the stand on me
I'm by your side when this shit get out of hand homie
That's why I keep them fuckin'

[Chorus: TeeJay3k]
Bands on me, bands on me
Shawty, please don't put your hands on me, hands on me
I got all these bands on me, bands on me
I got all these bands on me, all these bands on me
I got all these bands on me, bands on me
Shawty, please don't put your hands on me, hands on me
I got all these bands on me, bands on me
I got all these bands on me, all these bands on me

[Outro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
My pockets bigger than a tumor
I'm spreadin' money like a rumor
You can't measure it with no ruler
Never leave the house without my Ruger
