[Intro]
Whoa Kenny!

[Verse 1]
Hold up, you know it's the logo, say HB
The Glock got no safety, don't push me, Iâ€™ll do it
Please do not push me, you think that I'm pussy?
Got too much to lose, nigga, don't make me lose it
I can't be trusting no bitch, is you stupid?
I came with a shooter, he came with a Ruger
I just seen one of my bros on the news
I can't call him no more, he respect why I do it
I'm in the big body Benz with my friends
And it look like we just hit a lick off the jeweler
Look like a dope boy, I hop out a Rolls Royce
They taking my flows like I said they can use it
Dirty Diana, I'm pushing a Phantom
I know that they wanna see me in a Buick
Three different bourbons, we twenty-one deep
You see gang in the shows like they don't know my music
Fuck all the bitches that fronted on me when I didn't have money
You feeling so stupid
I'm from the trenches where niggas get hit up for nothing
You better go get on your bully
Niggas be acting so tough
You can front if you want
Got some shit that could knock down a bully
Niggas be talking to police
You don't even know me
You only hear what's in the music

[Chorus]
Talking to the feds is a no-no
I can get bread with my eyes closed
Insecure, so she got lipo
VVS's on me, that's a light show
It could get litty like a light show
Nigga I'm litty like a light show
If it's 'bout money, I'ma go-go
Fucked a couple bros, she a ho-ho

[Verse 2]
Too addicted, hard to stop it
Fell in love with Saint Laurent shit
Louis luggages and Monclers
Flyest niggas out the Bronx yeah
And we come straight out of Highbridge
I swear you don't wanna die, yeah
Don't get caught up in my projects
I don't need no yes men 'round me
Talking about lets get fleet-fleet
Come around tryna get tree-tree
Popping on pills with the bean-bean
Rolling through the hills off the lean-lean
Don't hate me, just love me
Melody, nigga, she need me
Blowing me kisses through the TV
Look at me now I'm beasty
I'm beasty, I'm beasty, too OD, I'm beasty
Nigga I cut her off easy
Word to my mother, I'm beasty, I'm beasty, I'm beasty
Saint Laurent sweater cost three Gs
Fucking on the bro, just to meet me
Okay you would eat her like E-E

[Chorus]
Talking to the feds is a no-no
I can get bread with my eyes closed
Insecure, so she got lipo
VVS's on me, that's a light show
Hizzy get litty like a light show
Nigga I'm litty like a light show
If it's 'bout money, I'ma go-go
Fucked a couple bro, she a hoe-hoe
