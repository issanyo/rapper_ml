[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
They don't ever give a fuck 'bout a nigga when he down
So I keep my head up, ain't no need to look around
But I gotta watch my back, just in case a nigga front
Young independent nigga, I do anything I want
You too worried 'bout the bitches so you don't know how to win
I'm just focused on the middle, I don't wanna see the end
Got a pocket full of wishes so I'm walking with a limp
I said fuck them other niggas, I ain't worried 'bout a friend
Ric Flair, that's my brother, you can holler any day
Type of nigga got my back when I ain't got no place to stay
Niggas love to see you down but when you coming up they hate
Talk that shit behind your back and they won't say it in your face
And I miss my baby girl, I think about it every day
When I left you over there I know you felt some type of way
But I swear I'm coming back and I just wish that I could stay
Ain't no child but you my destiny, I make you say my name

[Hook: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
So tell me what's real and what's fake, yeah
I know if it's real if you tell me how you feel
They tellin' lies and they hatin'
I know how to deal with you, I know how to deal with you

[Hook: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
So tell me what's real and what's fake, yeah
I know if it's real if you tell me how you feel
They tellin' lies and they hatin'
I know how to deal with you, I know how to deal with you

[Verse 2: Don Q]
Coming up in the streets where niggas is weighing pies
Thirty thousand on the cross is how we pay our tides
Tryna stay alive with niggas can't survive, they hittin'
Takin' lives if you plotting on takin' knives
Throwing pebbles but we bricked up
In the dirt where you end up
Swerving through in the Benz truck
Suicidal, my wrists cut
Haters ain't slick, consequences tryna stick us
Bathing Ape shit, your whole hood getting zipped up
Designer in my wardrobe, I'm stunting on my old hoes
I don't drink, I just pour rolls, this sweater cost me four O's
Backing up, keep the door closed
Niggas telling but Lord knows
We turn that house to a bando when it get foreclosed
They doing too much dick riding, I ain't with the switch-siding
Lil nigga in a big body, you can't do shit 'bout it
Only class I love is math, that's why I'm quick countin'
Might slide up in the dealer and pull a six out

[Hook: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
So tell me what's real and what's fake, yeah
I know if it's real if you tell me how you feel
They tellin' lies and they hatin'
I know how to deal with you, I know how to deal with you

[Hook: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
So tell me what's real and what's fake, yeah
I know if it's real if you tell me how you feel
They tellin' lies and they hatin'
I know how to deal with you, I know how to deal with you
