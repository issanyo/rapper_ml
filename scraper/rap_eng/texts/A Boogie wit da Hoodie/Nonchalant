[Intro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
And I want you to be my bitch
And I want you to be my bitch
And I want you to be my

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I been feelin' so nonchalant
And I want you to be my bitch
I don't want you to be my friend
I just got to let you know
I been feelin' so nonchalant
And I hope it never ever ever ends
I just wanted you to be my bitch
I just got to let you know

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Don't want to tell you "I told you" but look, I told you
I was feelin' your picture, so yeah I wrote you
Girl, I don't want your number, I want your social
We can get money together, girl I can show you
Tell me whatever you want and I won't expose you
Bring another girl over that we can both do
Girl she can eat it up, eat it up like it's soul food
I could get fly any weather, pull up in snow shoes
I could get fly any weather, pull up in snow shoes
Gucci hat, Gucci sweater, I'm feelin' so cold
Before I flooded the Bezel that shit was rose gold
It was a time when the money was movin' so slow
I give the lawyer my money until the case close
It's whatever, my niggas gon' let that thing go
VVS's, they glitter up like a rainbow
VVS's, they glitter up like a rainbow

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
But I'm still feelin' so nonchalant
And I want you to be my bitch
I don't want you to be my friend
I just got to let you know
I been feelin' so nonchalant
And I hope it never ever ever ends
I just wanted you to be my bitch
I just got to let you know

[Verse 2: Alkaline]
Check out dem levels yah we no see each other regular
Cause she come from a different side of world
Me come from Nebula
Two different schedules
Phone talking pon di cellular
Someting in the back ah mih mind, side ah mih medulla
Tell me say dah lifestyle yah nuh fit you, you nuh ready fah girl
All the consequences weh come when you deh wid a world star artiste/You n'haffi talk it”
Hope you find somebody who can treat your booty way you deserve
I'm not Pinnochio, sorry I'm not no Romeo
She want me for herself but she has to know that’s not the way it goes
Me a try to be a better man but it might take a while
Take it easy with me, ‘member we young and we still a grow
And if you get a man, and get a family/Make sure you tell the boy da pussy deh still a fi mi
Sorry if me let you down
Sorry if me never listen
But either way mi deh ina mi zone

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I been feelin' so nonchalant (nonchalant)
And I want you to be my bitch (my bitch)
I don't want you to be my friend
I just got to let you know
I been feelin' so nonchalant (nonchalant)
And I hope it never ever ever ends
I just wanted you to be my bitch (bitch)
I just got to let you know

[Outro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
And I want you to be my bitch
And I want you to be my bitch
And I want you to be my
I been feelin' so nonchalant
