[Intro]
And I feel like I'm
By accident

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm stalking you, I swear
I keep on watching your snaps, I'm stuck on your Instagram
And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't
Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand

[Verse 1]
But girl, I feel like I walk past you, flexed on you by accident
I hopped in a Bentley, I don't plan on crashing it
I told you that I love you baby, I was gassin' it
Gold blunts rolled up, I ain't mashing it
Before you was my baby baby you was just a friend
And know that I was just in the streets hustlin'
They threw me in the jungle so I started bussin' licks
I ran into a mic and then I said, "Fuck the shit"
They call me young Mike, 'bout to get the glove and shit
Two diamond rings yea I paid a dub for it
Throw subs at me bet I don't respond to it
I'm countin' up money while you niggas commenting
Stuck on your ex and I can get you over it
VVS on my neck, let's come and see how cold it get
Before I sent you that message I was on my thirtieth sip
I was drinking a Sunkist and then I put the dirty in it

[Chorus]
And I swear, that's why I'm watching your snaps
I'm stuck on your Instagram
And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't
Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand
I feel like I'm stalking you, I swear
I keep on watching your snaps, I'm stuck on your Instagram
And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't
Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand
I feel like I'm

[Verse 2]
Should pick you up in my spaceship
You're way too good for me
I ran out of shit to say, she ask me questions all day
I can't keep making up stories
She said goodbye and left me in the cold
If I can't take it, I'm sorry
I need good vibes, if not, leave me alone
I swear I hate to see you walk away
But you look so damn good when you walk away
Do you ever think about stalkin' me
Cause I do just in case you been wondering

[Chorus]
And I swear, that's why I'm watching your snaps
I'm stuck on your Instagram
And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't
Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand
I feel like I'm stalking you, I swear
I keep on watching your snaps, I'm stuck on your Instagram
And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't
Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand
I feel like I'm
