[Intro: Don Q & A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'm pullin' up on some other shit
Other shit, other shit, other shit
Gang!
I pull up on bitches that fronted on me
I had nothing my nigga, we came up from nothing
Ha!
Don

[Hook: Don Q]
Woke up feeling like Money Mitch
I just, I just hit another lick
If that ho ain't sucking dick
I put her ass on punishment
Fuck who you niggas run and get
I wish them pussies would come attempt
I'm pullin' up on some other shit
Yeah, I'm pullin' up on some other shit
VVS's, that's some other shit
My diamonds dancing, on some other shit
I pull up speeding in some other shit
My bitch with me with another bitch
And we pullin' up on some other shit
Yeah, we pullin' up on some other shit
And I'm pullin' up on some other shit
And, I'm pullin' up on some other shit

[Verse 1: Don Q]
Diamonds dancing while I fuck the bitch
I let it hang, I don't tuck the shit
With my cousin, got a bunch of shit
I just let her see them hundreds flip
You pillow talkin' that's some sucker shit
So the shooters know just who to come to get
They got me back on that gutter shit
That sellin' that pack to your mother shit
I'm on the Deegan and they caught me speeding
With a Puerto Rican and she known for eating
Niggas hating, I don't know the reason
They say they kickin' but I don't believe them
She don't answer, I don't call her twice
My fit black but it's off white
They hanging with us and they taking pictures hopin' they can get some more likes
Yeah my soda got lean in it
Perc tens, I got three in it
My system always got weed in it
I don't never do the speed limit
I leave the party, just me and Gotti
In the foreign car with like three behind me
Louis shades, I don't see nobody
Retro J's and my tee Givenchy

[Hook: Don Q]
Woke up feeling like Money Mitch
I just, I just hit another lick
If that ho ain't sucking dick
I put her ass on punishment
Fuck who you niggas run and get
I wish them pussies would come attempt
I'm pullin' up on some other shit
Yeah, I'm pullin' up on some other shit
VVS's, that's some other shit
My diamonds dancing, on some other shit
I pull up speeding in some other shit
My bitch with me with another bitch
And, we pullin' up on some other shit
Yeah, we pullin' up on some other shit
And, I'm pullin' up on some other shit
And, I'm pullin' up on some other shit

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
My niggas ain't with nothing
Shoot at your fucking cousin
Ain't with the fucking bluffing
If I gotta pull up I'm dumping
Hundred round with a drum in
Might hit a nigga in his stomach
If I hear another sub it
Better be about money
Better be about the money
Gang pull up and they stunting
Chain on me half a hundred
Y'all ain't even see this coming
I might just take over the summer
I might just fuck your baby mama
And take her out to Benihana's
Fuckin' up a couple commas
Laces hanging off the Yeezys
Niggas really wanna be me
This flexing shit ain't easy
Wrist game on 3D
They facial expression is sour
While I'm getting money by the hour
Niggas wanna be down but
No new niggas 'round us

[Hook: Don Q]
Woke up feeling like Money Mitch
I just, I just hit another lick
If that ho ain't sucking dick
I put her ass on punishment
Fuck who you niggas run and get
I wish them pussies would come attempt
I'm pullin' up on some other shit
Yeah, I'm pullin' up on some other shit
VVS's, that's some other shit
My diamonds dancing, on some other shit
I pull up speeding in some other shit
My bitch with me with another bitch
And, we pullin' up on some other shit
Yeah, we pullin' up on some other shit
And, I'm pullin' up on some other shit
And, I'm pullin' up on some other shit

[Outro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I pull up on bitches that fronted on me
I had nothing my nigga, we came up from nothing
Ha!
Came up from nothing my nigga
QP, I fuck with you nigga
Fleezy, I fuck with you nigga
BD, I fuck with you nigga
