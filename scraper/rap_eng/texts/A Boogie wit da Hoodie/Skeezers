[Intro]
The Atomix

[Chorus]
I cannot love on no skeezer
That is a dub, I don't need her
I hit her once, then I leave her
Blow up my phone for no reason
I cheated on you with a dancer
Okay, I surrender, my hands up
At least I admit it, I man up
I do not have all the answers
And I gotta stay with the nine these days
Bitches that get niggas lined these days
And I am not with all the drama, ayy
Pop him just for movin’ wocky, ayy
Highbridge niggas, they be wildin', ayy
You sleepin' on me but I’m wide awake
Eliantte bring tsunamis, ayy
Jump inside the water, ride the wave, yeah

[Verse 1]
Up to no goodie, I put on my hoodie
Got sick of Margielas, got rid of the Truey
And I'm on a private jet gettin' some pussy
Givenchy, Givenchy, my luggage is Louis
Don't wanna stress you, no, baby, I just wanna sex you
Undress you, don't wanna caress you
Don't wanna tell you I love you if I do not mean it
Them niggas will say that to hit you
I love you, I hate you, I don't want you back now
Go through some things that you cannot take back now
I reach out to people who don't reach me back now
I need you, I need you, it’s too late, I’m mad now
I spazzed out, they backed out, the mag now, they sat down
I love my life more than I love my lifestyle
I love my ice, how it shine even when the lights out
She pulled my lights out but I swear, no I

[Chorus]
I cannot love on no skeezer
That is a dub, I don't need her
I hit her once, then I leave her
Blow up my phone for no reason
I cheated on you with a dancer
Okay, I surrender, my hands up
At least I admit it, I man up
I do not have all the answers
And I gotta stay with the nine these days
Bitches that get niggas lined these days
And I am not with all the drama, ayy
Pop him just for movin’ wocky, ayy
Highbridge niggas, they be wildin', ayy
You sleepin' on me but I'm wide awake
Eliantte bring tsunamis, ayy
Jump inside the water, ride the wave, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Like (Like), how (How), you (You), move (Move)
Same (Same), way (Way), I (I), do (Do)
Five (Five), thou’ (Thou'), 'sand (On), on shoes (Shoes)
I (I), might act a fool
I'm stuck like I'm glued, I like sex in twos
I spy with my third eye on you, I spy
You know I gotta stay ten toes, I ball like LaMelo and Lonzo
I started off wearin' Kenzo, bitches put me in the friendzone
She had my heart it was real cold, I took it back 'cause the bitch stole
And you never know what a bitch knows, I can't be lovin' no ho, oh

[Chorus]
I cannot love on no skeezer
That is a dub, I don't need her
I hit her once, then I leave her
Blow up my phone for no reason
I cheated on you with a dancer
Okay, I surrender, my hands up
At least I admit it, I man up
I do not have all the answers
And I gotta stay with the nine these days
Bitches that get niggas lined these days
And I am not with all the drama, ayy
Pop him just for movin' wocky, ayy
Highbridge niggas, they be wildin', ayy
You sleepin' on me but I'm wide awake
Eliantte bring tsunamis, ayy
Jump inside the water, ride the wave, yeah

[Outro]
Like (Like), how (How), you (You), move (Move)
Same (Same), way (Way), I (I), do (Do)
Five (Five), thou' (Thou'), 'sand (On), on shoes (Shoes)
I (I), might act a fool
