[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I heard these niggas, tryna line me, but I ain't no dummy
It's okay, got a Draco, if you really want it
I spent 13 on a ring, now I feel unlucky
And she love my diamond ring, she say she wanna touch it
Its okay, I get 30K, just to hit the stage
Sip Ros√©, hit my Michael J, in my Michael J's
I get cake, I cannot complain
Been finnesin', since I was a kid
In the second grade, sellin' lemonade
Get paid, hol' up nigga wait can I get paid?
Young nigga in a fuckin' Wraith, feel like I'm in space
See a snake nigga, kill a snake, then killer get paid
Niggas gettin' left everyday, so get your shit straight

[Chorus: Zoey Dollaz]
I heard these niggas always hating', said I'd never make it
I heard these niggas always pillow talkin' with them bitches
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, yeah (it's okay, yeah)
It's okay, its okay, it's okay, yeah (it's okay, yeah)
I heard these niggas mad at me, 'cause I'm gettin' money

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, yeah  (it's okay, yeah)
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, yeah  (it's okay, yeah)

[Verse 3: Zoey Dollaz]
You niggas mad, 'cause I'm tryna feed my family
Why I gotta watch my friends, more than enemies
I had to stunt on a nigga, that I ain't 'posed to stunt with
I had to catch your views, on some dirt shit
You supposed to be my dog, why you hate on me?
It took some sense, turn your friends into enemies
Eh, that shits crazy, 'cause a nigga shinin', now you actin' shady
Yeah, well I guess its okay
My momma told me, you would show me your ways (your ways)
And, but I gotta cheque going ham (ham)
I had to fuck up the Benz, nigga pull up in a Lamb'
Diamonds on me look like damn

[Chorus: Zoey Dollaz]
I heard these niggas always hating', said I'd never make it
I heard these niggas always pillow talkin' with them bitches
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, yeah (it's okay, yeah)
It's okay, its okay, it's okay, yeah (it's okay, yeah)
I heard these niggas mad at me, 'cause I'm gettin' money
I heard these niggas mad at me, 'cause these bitches on me
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, yeah  (it's okay, yeah)
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, yeah  (it's okay, yeah)

[Outro]
Okay, okay, okay
