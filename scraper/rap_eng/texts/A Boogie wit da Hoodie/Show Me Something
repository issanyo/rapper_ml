[Intro: A Boogie]
Show me something real
That's just how I feel
Don't you lie lie lie
Show me something real

[Verse 1: Snoopy Dinero]
Look, undercover love is hard to be the one who knows
To play the sidenigga knowing you can't let it show
Cause it was fun and games until I started thinking 'bout it
Bitch you not gon' play me if I want you, he don't keep you happy
I'm not the type to go and really care but damn I miss it when you used to run your fingers through my hair
And pictures being sent to each other just to have em all
Drunk nights made you happy, me and you always had a ball
After sober blunts 'bout what we did the night before
Silly convos through the text we never called each other's phone
Cause I knew my place and now it starts to get to me
Cause knowing I can't have you when I snap back to reality
This shit is getting crazy cause I never thought we'd get attached
Arguments we always had cause you always made me mad
But now I see that all I did was set myself up for the trap
Cause you know you better off with him
But you know that's not gonna last

[Chorus: A Boogie]
Show me something real if you really down to ride for me
Show me something real don't you ever fucking lie to me
Show me something real I don't care if it's gonna hurt
I'd rather be the one that knows that he ain't half of what i'm worth
Show me something real if you really down to ride for me
Show me something real don't you ever fucking lie to me
Show me something real I don't care if it's gonna hurt
I'd rather be the one that knows that he ain't half of what i'm worth

[Verse 2: Snoopy Dinero]
Knowing every move I make and how I am with someone else
Anything I've asked of you ain't always end up being done
But when that nigga asks you for something man you always jump
I don't wanna be a side nigga cause I fell in love
How you think I feel when I can't talk about you to my dawg
It wasn't 'posed to be like this but I seen it coming
Shit was getting hectic and you quick to start running from it
Cause you care about yourself, fuck whatever happens to me
I was fucking stupid, making you what really mattered to me
They don't need to know the details cause you know you wrong
And you know you the only reason why I wrote this song
Show me something real, show me something real
Have respect when I'm around, you know how to hold it down
I don't wanna see you with no hickeys on your fucking neck
And always keep that nigga in a box and make sure it's checked

[Chorus: A Boogie]
Show me something real if you really down to ride for me
Show me something real don't you ever fucking lie to me
Show me something real I don't care if it's gonna hurt
I'd rather be the one that knows that he ain't half of what i'm worth
Show me something real if you really down to ride for me
Show me something real don't you ever fucking lie to me
Show me something real I don't care if it's gonna hurt
I'd rather be the one that knows that he ain't half of what i'm worth

[Outro]
He ain't half of what I'm worth
That nigga lied lied lied, yeah
