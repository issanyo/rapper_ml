[Intro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Davido]
Yeah
Oh yeah
(Let's go, let's go)
Yeah
(Let's go, let's go)
Oh yeah

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Davido]
I'm way too fly, shine in the night time
I'm a vampire but I don't bite, come inside when it's daylight
But please don't waste my time, I'm timeless I can't lie
I bet I can hit it, give me one night (give me one night)
If I say the right lines

[Verse 1: Davido]
Oh, girl, I tell you say you the one though
Oh, girl, I thought you said you the one
For your heart girl, I'll be a lover
Mami, I promise say na, you be the one
Pop pop, stack up, eh, pop, fly up
Me I know you dey get no matter
I just like this your baka
Oh baby I was chilling by the bar
Sippin' at the sea, you was having sex on the beach
Baby girl we gon' shut down, oh, my girl, we go one time
This pussy got me on lockdown, I like it when she comes around, yeah

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Davido]
I'm way too fly, shine in the night time
I'm a vampire but I don't bite, come inside when it's daylight
But please don't waste my time, I'm timeless I can't lie
I bet I can hit it, give me one night (give me one night)
If I say the right lines

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I got the juice baby, yeah, put you in the mood baby, yeah
Sex with you was too crazy, yeah, wish there was two of you baby
Yeah, I need two of you, you should move how I move too, yeah
Black hoodie and some black boots in the 2018 Benz coupe, yeah
Left wrist lookin' like ooh, and my pinky ring on froze, ooh yeah
Diamonds looking so cold, like an angel in the snow, yeah oh
All my niggas on go, act crazy on the road, mm-yeah
My Patek used to be gold, now it's 50 for a show, mm-yeah

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Davido]
I'm way too fly, shine in the night time
I'm a vampire but I don't bite, come inside when its daylight
But please don't waste my time, I'm timeless I can't lie
I bet I can hit it, give me one night (give me one night)
If I say the right lines
