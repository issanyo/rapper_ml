[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
I see some haters in the club, send a bottle to 'em
I got some animals around, I can't supply the zoo
Tear a nigga crib up and make his momma move
I heard they got a lot of hate, ain't got no money though (niggas broke)
She can't stand me, I ain't shit, I bet I fuck her though (bitch)
The watch look good plain gold, I'm still gon' flood it though
You spent all that money on that chain, what you tuckin' for?
Me and Boogie from the trenches, we became legends
Me and my niggas was good kids, we became felons
Won't let them trip me off the streets, I was raised better
Grew up around swipers, hitmen, and cane stretchers

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I remember gettin' my first watch, that shit was Michael Kors
But now I'm pullin' up in shit that niggas can't afford
You wasn't shit to me my nigga, now you try and call
You wasn't with me in the gym, you wasn't John Wall
The penitentiary got me sittin' here like "Fuck the law"
They gave like 20 to my nigga for the wrong cause
But I'm like fuck it though, my nigga I'm gon' grind hard
Wintertime I had that pack up in my long johns
All day, same Balmain jeans for days
Play no games, do you really want a problem? (ayy)
Saint Laurent Jeans, Gucci snake up on my collar (ayy)
Same old things, same fiends in the hallway

[Verse 3: Tee Grizzley]
Broad day, that's how we comin' out when them dogs play
Lil K, sent her upstate to make sure them dogs straight
Half a kilo, ain't talkin' drugs, that's what the charm weigh
Iced my whole wrist like I'm gettin' rid of an arm ache
Wanna book a show?
20,000, that's the going rate
Long day, make her kneel before me 'til her jaws ache
Spit that game to her, tell that bitch, "I think we soulmates"
Fly her out, after I fuck her I'ma stay far away

[Verse 4: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Young nigga in a iced out 3D necklace
My pinkie cold, it make me stutter, "V-V-V-V-S-S"
They try to catch me all alone, but we was deep in Texas
She wanted me to be alone, but we go deep wherever
I saw you lookin' at your phone, I know you see me textin'
Don't have me blowin' up your phone, just tell me "Keep it steppin'"
If I run into you again, don't tell me you regret it
If I run into you again, you gon' see how I'm flexin'

[Verse 5: Tee Grizzley]
When I was broke, I was neglected
Bitches wasn't textin'
Now they tryna pop up pregnant, that's to be expected
I wish I could see the face on all my exes
Let 'em see the face on a Patek, I used to sleep on pallets

[Verse 6: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Tee Grizzley]
I feel you bro, 'cause me and Sosa was sleepin' on sofas
Now all the bitches that was frontin', they all on some hoe shit
But I could never pay attention to a broke bitch, yeah
I became a legend, now I need a trophy
I became a legend off a four minute hit
Niggas from the trenches, they ain't seen shit like this
Me and Tee Grizz on some whole other shit, ayy
Me and Tee Grizz, that's a whole 'nother hit, ayy
