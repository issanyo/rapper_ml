[Intro: Casanova & A Boogie]
Talk to them Boogie
I think I found it
Well, me too
And there ain't no way around it
We ain't runnin' from love bro
It is what it is
We in love
Down bitch
We found a rider!

[Chorus: A Boogie]
They just jealous, ain't nothin' to do about it
And there ain't no way around it
I think I found it
I got my ride or die, I got my down bitch
She the only one I fuck with
Only girl I really keep it a buck with
In the bed she freaky, but good in public
My down bitch she the one I fell in love with
They just jealous, ain't nothin' to do about it
And there ain't no way around it
I think I found it
I got my ride or die, I got my down bitch
She the only one I fuck with
Only girl I really keep it a buck with
In the bed she freaky, but good in public
My down bitch she the one I fell in love with

[Verse 1: Casanova]
Told my niggas I love you they tried to clown it
But we caught a body together that they ain't found yet
Disrespect my name, nigga she won't allow that
She ain't 'fraid to swipe that piece, she 'bout it-'bout it
Fuck-fuck a ten, she a twelve
When I was in jail, she sent me the bail
When I got down, she sent me the mail
I was down, yeah I fell
But real niggas prevail
I came home, them other bitches was dubbed
We was hittin' the club, got introduced to the hub
She was holdin' my gun
She was holdin' my drugs
My ex would send me subs on the 'gram
But I don't give a fuck, could give a damn
'Cause when I walk through, she got me feelin' like the man
You a [?], my friends say I'm a ass
My friends say you want cash
Why they worried 'bout you and Cas, huh?

[Chorus: A Boogie]
They just jealous, ain't nothin' to do about it
And there ain't no way around it
I think I found it
I got my ride or die, I got my down bitch
She the only one I fuck with
Only girl I really keep it a buck with
In the bed she freaky, but good in public
My down bitch she the one I fell in love with
They just jealous, ain't nothin' to do about it
And there ain't no way around it
I think I found it
I got my ride or die, I got my down bitch
She the only one I fuck with
Only girl I really keep it a buck with
In the bed she freaky, but good in public
My down bitch she the one I fell in love with

[Verse 2: Casanova]
She roll my blunt, now baby, time let that weed come
I ain't gotta cheat, you know she down with a threesome
And she give me head every time that I need some
She right by the window, yellin' out when the D's come
'Cause real bitches never fold
She never stashed on me when I sent her on the road
Her body type, her pussy good as gold
She got the numbers to my safe, so I'm stickin' to the code
She got my credit score up, yep, my baby coachin' me
Took out the coach bag, took out them coach seats
She rock designer, Louis, Gucci mostly
She know about my opps, so she watchin' niggas closely
So fuck your friends, fuck your homies
All of them bitches phony
They talk shit, none of them bitches know me
They just mad, they'd rather see you lonely

[Chorus: A Boogie]
They just jealous, ain't nothin' to do about it
And there ain't no way around it
I think I found it
I got my ride or die, I got my down bitch
She the only one I fuck with
Only girl I really keep it a buck with
In the bed she freaky, but good in public
My down bitch she the one I fell in love with
They just jealous, ain't nothin' to do about it
And there ain't no way around it
I think I found it
I got my ride or die, I got my down bitch
She the only one I fuck with
Only girl I really keep it a buck with
In the bed she freaky, but good in public
My down bitch she the one I fell in love with
