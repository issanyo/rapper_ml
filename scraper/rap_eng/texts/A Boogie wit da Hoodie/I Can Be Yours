VERSE 1 (Megan)

I heard that you the man man man man man man
And that you count them band band band band band bands
I wanna call you da-da-da-da-daddy
How can I be your, how can I be your
How can I be your ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
And you can come and pam-pam-pam-pamper me
Or you can take me out out out on the street
And we can get it, yea we can get it

HOOK (Bobbie leads, everyone on bgvs)

You know I like it when they pam-pam-pam-pamper me
I like it when they pam-pam-pam-pamper me
And you can give your love and lump sums to me (can I be yours, can I be yours, can I? can I?)
You know I like it when they pam-pam-pam-pamper me
I like when they pam-pam-pam-pamper me
You recognize this l-l-love ain’t for free (can I? can I?)
(can I be yours, can I be yours, can I be your babygirl?)

POST HOOK (Megan)

Tell me what you want from me
Take a look at what you see
I’ll let you know if this right here
Is something you can have

VERSE 2 (Arielle)

You know I like the way you spend spend spend spend them ends
I like your new ben-ben-ben-ben-ben-Benz
If you need me to dan-dan-dan-dance for it
It can be yours, it can be yours
You got a lot of fan fan fan fans I see
Like that money gro-o-ow from the trees
But if you spend it all all all all on me
I could be yours, I could be yours

(A BOOGIE)
Been places, big faces
She in love with [?]
Cause a nigga famous, aye
Just another thottie in a different fragrance, aye
Said I got her heart, I'll fuck around and break it, aye
Don't think I'm the one that you gon' fucking play with
When it come to foreign cars, I pull up in the latest
I love money, you love money, you can be my lady
Met a lotta pretty girls but you my favorite

VERSE 3 (JL)

Too much is never too much
When he pick me up I wanna ride him like a school bus
Soon as I see him yea you know it’s on sight
Lookin like a snack, wanna take a bite
Boo loving in the club yea we startin something new
Chocolate-covered bunny
And he like the way I move
Paper on demand yea I got it on cue
Ain’t gotta hold your breath
When the money turn blue
Love me when I’m crazy, say it’s gon last
So if you ever try me your tires gettin slashed
Pull up to the rear with the whole front crashed
If you ever leave a good girl it’ll be your last yea
