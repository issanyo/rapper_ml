[Intro]
Whoa Kenny

[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
In the jungle with my feet up, lookin' like King Caesar
I got my felonies up, I had the wrong demeanor
I got sick of fake love, I started sippin' lean up
They get scared and turn blood and tell you different reasons
And I don't wanna make love with you to beat my meat up
You wanna be my main slut, you gotta eat up, eat up
You wanna be my sweet love but you is not Anita
I feel like I'm a baker, always got my heater
Yeah, that's your best friend (Yeah)
She told you that I bought all Herm√®s shit, yeah
Mmh, that's your best friend
I might as well just fuck you both, you're best friends
Mmh, yeah, you know you love me, bitch
And you know I love it when you start doin' that slutty shit, yeah
Fuck you so good, I should just start sellin' dick, yeah
I'm only 22, I just started havin' fun with it, yeah yeah, ayy
Tellin' me I'm so humble now, I'm so done with it, yeah yeah, ayy
I been thuggin' on AP, you suckin' dick, yeah yeah, ayy
Yeah I'm up now but I miss bein' on the block, yeah yeah
Will you be my best friend, girl? Yeah or nah? Yeah yeah

[Chorus: Lil Quee]
Hey, 'cause I need a best friend, uh
Play the block like Tetris, uh
Yeah, I'm sorry to be selfish
Baby girl, it was worth it
Yeah, 'cause I need a best friend, uh
Play the block like Tetris, uh
Yeah, I'm sorry to be selfish
Baby girl, it was worth it

[Verse 2: Quando Rondo]
Every nigga in your clique, yeah they gon' feel me
If I ever cheated on you, would you still leave?
No impersonatin' nigga, this the real me
Convicted felon, but that pistol, yeah, I still keep
I really came up from the bottom, they didn't believe us
And I can't show that ho respect because you not Aretha
I swear I came up from the 'partments, runnin' with that nina
I'm pourin' all this Hi-Tech inside an Aquafina
And ever since I got a check I feel like I don't need 'em
I got my mind on that Corvette, see I don't want the Nissan
No I don't fuck 'round with these niggas 'cause they really peons
I'm drippin' sauce, that's on the daily, this that brand new VLONE
I'm only human, so baby, no I ain't perfect
Fifteen hundred on Jimmy Choos, you deserve it
I'm only human, so baby, no I ain't perfect
Fifteen hundred on Jimmy Choos, you deserve it
And if I cheat I know that you gon' close the curtains
24 hours, that's out the week, yeah, we were certain
"Do you love me, Quando?" That be that girl's favorite question
I reply with, "I love you," 'cause I really need a best friend

[Chorus: Lil Quee]
Hey, 'cause I need a best friend, uh
Play the block like Tetris, uh
Yeah, I'm sorry to be selfish
Baby girl, it was worth it
Yeah, 'cause I need a best friend, uh
Play the block like Tetris, uh
Yeah, I'm sorry to be selfish
Baby girl, it was worth it

[Outro: Lil Quee & A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Hey, 'cause I need a best friend, uh

Hey, 'cause I need a best friend, uh
Baby girl, it was worth it
Hey, 'cause I need a best friend, uh
Play the block like Tetris, uh
Hey, 'cause I need a best friend, uh
Will you be my best friend, girl? Yeah or nah? Yeah yeah
