[Intro]
Turn me up
Jamz turn me up

[Verse]
I know you heard of the boogie man
I am that nigga he woulda been
Hoodie on like I'm the reaper though
17 deep in the sprinter van
I heard they tryna get equal though
I would not let them get even man
She told me she trying to get into it
But I know these bitches be sneaky man
Murder she wrote, murder all she wrote
I can go Boogie or Artist flow
I probably got every car you drove
I probably fucked every broad you know
Bitch if you think I'm a target, no
Want me to take you to Barney`s, no
Run it up see how far we go
Double up but be cautious though
I know they hate seeing me in first class
I'm a young nigga wearing Hermès
I came up from the big x
And came home to a big bag
I'm a big boss and you big mad
Fuck around and die by my respect
I got blood all over my christians
From all my oppositions
Fuck all my oppositions
Like every pair damn loubs now I got blisters
And all of my day ones caught up in the system
If she don't want me then I fuck with her sister
I'm so grimy when it comes to these bitches
I hit her then end up going missing
I'm up now it's no more hard feelings
Its cool I just put her in the friendzey
I just had to put her in a frenzy
I swear they don't wanna see me happy
They just wanna see me in my feelings
Used to be a little nappy nigga now I’m nappy with a couple million
On the come up they was laughing at me
Now they fucking with me cause I'm winning
Now they sayin' that I'm acting different
This shit change you when you really in it
And these days I can't come complain
I still get laid, I swear
I used to not get paid
I'm back to my old ways
Tech hoodie on
No chains
First pair of new Balmains
Had me feeling like Kirko Bangz
I embarrassed all my fly things
Only floor seats at the ball game
I got mad Saint Lauren shit
I told em’ nigga personally call me
Gotta stab bitch niggas in the streets that I ain’t even gotta call B
They be mad hoes after my shows following me to the lobby
I'm a asshole when they come to that
I don't want you bitches to line me
But thats just cause I get it
Been in my bag for a minute
I just flow with it
They all in my business, but
They just do not get it
Got blood on my shoes I'm sinning, yeah
New E.R.D. getting, yeah
A lot of niggas dress just like me
But its alright I already did it, yeah
Niggas wanna rap just like me
But its okay I already did it, yeah
Elliante got me icy
W's up I'm Winning, yeah
W's up I'm Winning
And I told her that I loved her but I didn't care
And if I expose her
It’s because she told my business, yeah
I’m kinda like Hov I ain't a business man
I’m a businessman
I miss my nigga V-12 and Montana man
Remember back when we was younger
I wish you was with me sitting in this benz
Now when we talk the convos be in lingo cause you in the feds
Got a little hard getting used to all these millions I keep came from minimum wage
Gotta little hard
Talking to you through a phone knowin' that I can’t see your face
Nigga with a wire started fucking with you
Nigga what the fuck did you say
Told you, you ain’t gotta sell grills no more nigga
But you did anyway
I wish they give you bail
You woulda been with me today
Real shit just free all my-(on god)
