(Hook: Angelica Vila)
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
But you can keep it steppin'
And you gon be regretted
Cause i'll be fine all on my own

(Pretty Lou)
I just hosted New York City Pretty Lou
As we take this to a whole nother level
Let's do it!

(Verse 1: Angelica Vila)
Oooh! I never had somebody like
You! But I just gotta fight it cause
You cannot have no more chances
You cannot take me for granted
I got you runnin' back for me
You should've thought about it for a minute
I got you beggin' hard for me
Can you answer my question

(Bridge 1: Angelica Vila)
Have you ever had another women do it to you like
The way you want it right?
Cause I don't really care you can get up with her I must've had much control
But if you're creepin', you just got to go
Oh baby

(Hook: Angelica Vila)
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
But you can keep it steppin'
And you gon be regretted
Cause i'll be fine all on my own

(Verse 2: A Boogie wit da Hoodie)
Why you on my phone you on my body
You gon make me think you prolly tryna lie to me
Askin' 'bout this b**** from Abu Dhabi
9 times out of 10 she was a thotty
I ain't a killa but don't make me catch a body
Do a drill and i'll let cuban hold a shotty
I'm hittin' anything I try to get beside me
After that i'm making sure they never find me yeah!
And bankrolls money, cars and her clothes
Make her say h**'s i'll be out there on a roll
Tryna let go every color mind clear
Cause I stay cold (seen a lot of n****'s out here
We ain't stayin' cold i'm about to level up and i'ma
Take over got me fed up I ain't playin' 'bout my
Money though I don't care about these b****es
They don't run me though)

(Bridge 2: Angelica Vila)
Cause i'm about to level up on you
It had me fed up waitin' up on you
But I don't really care you can get up with her I must've had much control
But if you're creepin', you just got to go
Oh baby

(Hook: Angelica Vila)
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
But you can keep it steppin'
And you gon be regretted
Cause i'll be fine all on my own

(Outro: Pretty Lou)

As I told you we gonna take it to a whole nother level
Let's do it!
