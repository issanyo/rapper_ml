Hook:
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Every where that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

Verse 1 (Alex)
Now Im just a creep,a weirdo,then Im just bringing
These stuff again I dont know why Im Swinging
Girl I’ve been thinking about you all Around and around
Now Im gonna give you the reason why,I’ll stop Sinking
Cuz she’s pretty and Cute
There,now you can stop being Rude
Hey,If I sounds stupid to you
Well,If you get offended then Fuck you too
Now im just having these Demons
Now my friends are being so Schiemin
Since this fucking pain is freezing
Now I can’t free this damn semen
Wait what?
I dont know
Fuck you guys if you dont like Lose Control
Even if you hate the damn flow
Why is my channel going high to Low
“Man I dont like your Waifu”
Well guess what Cool Mon? Then Fuck You
I dont even want your criticism
Continue making your fucking memes

Verse 2:
Never had a relationship but I can relate
Cause of my ma’ she passed back in April, it filled me with Hate
But I can understand where you're coming from in the end
Cause I just put on a show, I play a lot of pretend
You might hate me
You might love me
But just know that I'm never filled with Glee
I have a crush and I see the connection
And it takes over and spreads depression
Even if I don't show it
That doesn't mean I don't have it
My anxiety flows through me like blood pumping and a lighter that's been unlit
Don't worry about me, I'M FINE!
WHY DO YOU CARE YOU NEVER HELPED THE FIRST TIME!?
ITS NOT LIKE IM GONNA KILL MYSELF AM I?!
No, don't worry. I'll just keep the depression inside
And that will be last time that I see daylight
Unlike Alex with his track “you’ll never see the daylight”
