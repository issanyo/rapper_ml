[Intro: Trey Songz, Robin Thicke & A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Yeah, yeah, I like it!
Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya, teach ya
Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya, teach ya
Cause you've been a bad girl, bad girl
Someone's gonna have to

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Trey Songz]
Girl, I still fuck with you
Even though you've been a bad girl
I wanna teach you a lesson
Tell me to slow down if I'm goin' fast, girl
I know you want me to sweat you
I might undress you and run you a bath, girl
Cause you've been a bad girl
You've been a bad girl (hah)
Girl, I still fuck with you
Even though you've been a bad girl
I wanna teach you a lesson
Tell me to slow down if I'm goin' fast, girl
I know you want me to sweat you
I might undress you and run you a bath, girl (hah)
Cause you've been a bad girl (hah)
You've been a bad girl (ohh)
And you've been a bad girl, you've been a bad girl (You've been a bad, bad, bad girl)
You've been a bad girl, you've been a bad girl

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Trey Songz]
I thought I was lovin' it
I was in lust with it, told her that I cannot fuck with it
She like how I'm modest and she call me Artist
I love when she scream out my government (name)
I met her at Anex, I took her to my place
We fucked then popped bottles of bubbly
She ended up popping the Percs
She was wildin', I think she just wanted some company
I will not blame you for not resisting
You know I've been looking for time to kick it
Busy on Instagram liking pictures
You need to stop playing and come and visit
I need your location inside the DM
Your friends in the back, they like go and see him"
I seen her I swear she was looking mixed
I think she was Cuban and Puerto Rican (uh-huh)
And I need a bad bad girl
A no strings attached bad girl
I gotta teach her a lesson (teach her)
Go ahead and grab that girl

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Trey Songz]
Girl, I still fuck with you
Even though you've been a bad girl
I wanna teach you a lesson
Tell me to slow down if I'm goin' fast, girl
I know you want me to sweat you
I might undress you and run you a bath, girl (hah)
Cause you've been a bad girl (hah)
You've been a bad girl (ohh)
Girl, I still fuck with you
Even though you've been a bad girl
I wanna teach you a lesson
Tell me to slow down if I'm goin' fast, girl
I know you want me to sweat you
I might undress you and run you a bath, girl (hah)
Cause you've been a bad girl (hah)
You've been a bad girl (ohh)
And you've been a bad girl, you've been a bad girl (You've been a bad, bad, bad girl)
You've been a bad girl, you've been a bad girl

[Verse 2: Trey Songz & Robin Thicke]
She say she love when I'm touching it
Love when I'm touching it, feel like I'm ducking it
She say I stay up in her head
But I'm playing with her head and she finna be down with it (baby girl)
Woah now, woah now, baby slow down, you talking crazy
Woah now, woah now, baby slow down, I got you, bae
You just need a lil' spanking from your daddy
(Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson)
Next time all you gotta do is ask me (you've been a bad girl)

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Trey Songz]
Girl, I still fuck with you
Even though you've been a bad girl
I wanna teach you a lesson
Tell me to slow down if I'm goin' fast, girl (so fast girl)
I know you want me to sweat you
I might undress you and run you a bath, girl
Cause you've been a bad girl
You've been a bad girl (hah)
Girl, I still fuck with you
Even though you've been a bad girl
I wanna teach you a lesson
Tell me to slow down if I'm goin' fast, girl
I know you want me to sweat you
I might undress you and run you a bath, girl (hah)
Cause you've been a bad girl (hah)
You've been a bad girl (ohh)
And you've been a bad girl, you've been a bad girl (You've been a bad, bad, bad girl)
You've been a bad girl, you've been a bad girl

[Outro: Robin Thicke]
Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya, teach ya
Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya, teach ya
