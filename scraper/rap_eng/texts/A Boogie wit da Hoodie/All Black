[Intro - A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
She never called back
I pull up in all black
What you call that?
Pull up in all black

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
You kept on calling her phone
No wonder she never called back
You saw the message she wrote me
Lowkey, you want your hoe back
I get respect from the OG's
Police probably want my phone tapped
Hoodie and all that, I pull up in all black
All black going crazy, all black to the laces
All black, off white shit, all black, Balmains shit
They think I'm crazy, I think they hating
All black wraith racing, my all black spaceship

[Verse 1 - Flywalker Chee$e]
She'll ride with some stacks, hit the club in all black
Spent 10K up in Saks, all I'm speaking is facts
See, I ride with the panny all white, if you want bread, little nigga on sight
All black Louis I ain't missing no spikes
Only bad bitches, I ain't fucking no type
I say yeah, aye, I'm always on the go-go
Pitch black tent on the low-low
Your bitch, she a so-so
I hit that off 'cause I can, bro
Up in the club spending bands, hoe
I'm a trap nigga with some fans though
My designer ain't black, that Nike check is though

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
You kept on calling her phone
No wonder she never called back
You saw the message she wrote me
Lowkey, you want your hoe back
I get respect from the OG's
Police probably want my phone tapped
Hoodie and all that, pull up in all black
All black going crazy, all black to the laces
All black, off white shit, all black, Balmain shit
They think I'm crazy, I think they hating
All black Wraith racing, my all black spaceship

[Verse 2 - A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I pull up in the slides, she wanna get fucked and get high
She hopped in my ride, I told her to look at the sky
Look at the stars in the sky, I grabbed on her thigh
Forgot what I told her I lied, she wanted the whole number 9
Word to Allah, I'm a feelings type of guy
But I get gritty with my guys
In the city with my guys, getting chicken with my guys
Free my niggas doing time, fuck the rumors and the lies
I go do it with my guys, V12 told me I-
Gotta make it to the top, that's my nigga, I'mma ride
I'mma go do it, black hoodie, bitch, I know what I'm doing

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
You kept on calling her phone
No wonder she never called back
You saw the message she wrote me
Lowkey, you want your hoe back
I get respect from the OG's
Police probably want my phone tapped
Hoodie and all that, pull up in all black
All black going crazy, all black to the laces
All black, off white shit, all black, Balmain shit
They think I'm crazy, I think they hating
All black Wraith racing, my all black spaceship
