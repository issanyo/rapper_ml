[Pre-Chorus: Don Q]
She wanna fuck me for free
Even when I'm telling her no
All of this money on me
I can't be chasing no ho
I got Givenchy on me
I got that shit from the store
All of these diamonds on me
She see that shit when it glow

[Chorus: Don Q]
She wanna fuck me for free
She wanna fuck me for free
She wanna fuck me for free
She wanna fuck me for free
You can't get nothing for free
You cannot fuck me for free
Ho don't you touch me for free
You cannot fuck me for free

[Verse 1: Don Q]
Come at these niggas in full effect
I got that cup and it's full of Tech
This for the times that we couldn't flex
So I look like a check when I'm fully dressed
They cannot record
Cause I'm talking that shit that they cannot afford
I walk in the store
They ringing me up and they bringing me more
I met that freak on the tour
I made her sleep on the floor
Pouring codeine by the four
We never beefing with whores
I'm B.I.G in a link chain
Killer Cam in a pink Range
East coast, I'm like King James
I done came up, nigga things changed
Hold up, hold up, nigga wait a second
Nigga kick game on David Beckham
Niggas going through a lyr-recession
You get paid to party, we get paid to step in
She call me crazy as fuck
Cause I make her pay me to fuck
But ho you ain't pay me enough
Cruising through, driving the Wraith like a bus
I got your ho giving face in the cut

[Pre-Chorus: Don Q]
She wanna fuck me for free
Even when I'm telling her no
All of this money on me
I can't be chasing no ho
I got Givenchy on me
I got that shit from the store
All of these diamonds on me
She see that shit when it glow

[Chorus: Don Q]
She wanna fuck me for free
She wanna fuck me for free
She wanna fuck me for free
She wanna fuck me for free
You can't get nothing for free
You cannot fuck me for free
Ho don't you touch me for free
You cannot fuck me for free

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll, I know it's bankrolls
Pesos, make those, chains glow, diamonds on me rainbow
They gon' hate while I make more, it will never change though
They know, they know, they know, yeah nigga they know
Police on me, so you know we gotta stay low
Phone ring all day, won't speak unless you know the lingo
Don't think anything's OK, it ain't ever safe though
Up to something, why y'all think I'm taking breaks though?
Lurking in my Birkin, Maybach with the curtains
Seats moving when we turning, OG blunts burning
Buying chains 'cause we earned it, every call, man I swerve it
Loyalty and hard working, lot of niggas never learned it

[Pre-Chorus: Don Q]
She wanna fuck me for free
Even when I'm telling her no
All of this money on me
I can't be chasing no ho
I got Givenchy on me
I got that shit from the store
All of these diamonds on me
She see that shit when it glow

[Chorus: Don Q]
She wanna fuck me for free
She wanna fuck me for free
She wanna fuck me for free
She wanna fuck me for free
You can't get nothing for free
You cannot fuck me for free
Ho don't you touch me for free
You cannot fuck me for free
