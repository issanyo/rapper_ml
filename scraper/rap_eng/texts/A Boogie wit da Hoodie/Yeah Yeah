[Intro: Don Q]
Yeah
Don
M-M-M-Murda

[Verse 1: Don Q]
It's been some time, but it's worth the wait
These other niggas tryna perpetrate
Spreadin' money out in my circle and make it circulate
They got the nerve to say that I'm forgettin' 'bout niggas
But niggas forgettin' the favors I couldn't get out of niggas
We had to work for this plan to hit
I see him lookin' sideways, so I parked on the curb to put a slant in it
Nothing ever handed, we got on 'cause we demanded it
They know who the winners, the decision is unanimous

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I know I ain't perfect, but look I'm workin'
I could make a melody like, "Yeah, yeah"
We just turnin' up, what you really want?
They tryna tell us that we can't go back there
Don't tell me you love me, show me the money
Where I'm from, love can go bad, yeah
Don't you feel alone, I go through it too
Now turn around, let me hear you say, "Yeah, yeah"

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Stay ten toes down, I'm really focused
Look who I rolled with
Same damn gang as last year
If you didn't notice, niggas talk shit on some ho shit
'Til they hear that thing go "blam", yeah
Subliminal postin', yeah, they roast shit, they jokin'
Until we pull up to the scene like, "Yeah, yeah"
Everywhere we go now, they feelin' cautious, they worried
I can make it so you can't come back, yeah
I think we should stop the make-believin'
I be so damn fly without a reason
I made 65 over the weekend
I bring my whole gang to every event

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I know I ain't perfect, but look I'm workin'
I could make a melody like, "Yeah, yeah"
We just turnin' up, what you really want?
They tryna tell us that we can't go back there
Don't tell me you love me, show me the money
Where I'm from, love can go bad, yeah
Don't you feel alone, I go through it too
Now turn around, let me hear you say, "Yeah, yeah"

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
We come from the city that's never sleep
Stay on point or get hit up for no reason
My young niggas hurt them, they meant to murk 'em
They puttin' work in, have 'em bring it to you like, yeah, yeah
If that's what you want, you can get it too
Have 'em get at you, pull up with that blicky like, yeah, yeah
Southside to Highbridge, the live shit
Bali To Balmain, we out here on some fly shit
Different pedigree, yeah I'm from a different regime
On your ass, feel like I'm half-man, half-machine
When I say they don't want the smoke, they know just what I mean
I had they whole block taped off, call it a scene
Yeah, we on that same bullshit, sun up to sun down
Nigga pop out and get popped tryna run down
Go 'head, get popped tryna run down
Think a nigga bluffin', fuck around and get gunned down

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I know I ain't perfect, but look I'm workin'
I could make a melody like, "Yeah, yeah"
We just turnin' up, what you really want?
They tryna tell us that we can't go back there
Don't tell me you love me, show me the money
Where I'm from, love can go bad, yeah
Don't you feel alone, I go through it too
Now turn around, let me hear you say, "Yeah, yeah"
