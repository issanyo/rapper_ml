[Intro]
Tank God

[Chorus]
I be too blunt, I say the wrong things
I get too much, big money always
How could you switch on me, you said you won't change
I changed, you changed, but my money long, ayy
I'm way too blunt, I say the wrong things
I get too much, big money always
You just switched up, you said you won't change
I changed, you changed, but my money long, ayy

[Verse]
If I put a price on his head, hit him from long range
I gotta stack up my money, I'm workin' on off days
Count up a lot of blue hunnids, yeah that's what they all say
You lookin' beautiful girl, you look just like Beyonc√©
And I'm dangerously in love with you
I don't know what it is, but I fuck with you
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable
But you know that I've got trust issues
And you want to be out here strippin'
And you, that's the best with a stack
I should just pay your tuition, 'cause I know you're better than that
I know you always be trippin', 'cause you say I never be home
But that's how you know you my bitch, 'cause you always gon' pick up the phone
I won't be callin' you sis, don't you be out here callin' me bro
The bitches I wanted to hit used to be out here callin' me broke
They don't want me to win, I just want to be the GOAT
They don't want me to sin, it's the reason that I do

[Chorus]
I'm way too blunt, I say the wrong things
I get too much, big money always
How could you switch on me, you said you won't change
I changed, you changed, but my money long, ayy
I'm way too blunt, I say the wrong things
I get too much, big money always
You just switched up, you said you won't change
I changed, you changed, but my money long, ayy
