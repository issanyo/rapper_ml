Baby, will you go and let's slide
You don't gotta work, I told your boss, you can leave

Just enough time to make make you to fall in love with me

Dripped in Elliante, now everybody on your body
Never sorry

Be my bitch and my friend and never worry
Big 40 in a big Benz 'cause they lurking
Wrist got a hundred and ten worth of diamonds
'Cause she wanna fuck me with her friend, I like it
Say she wanna give me good head, how I like it

Remember when we was sitting in your bed getting naked
Remember when you were saying how I fuck too crazy

Roll the weed and let me smoke the sess
And you can lay upon my chest

Roll the weed and let me smoke the sess
And you can lay upon my chest, yeah

[Verse 2: Kojo Funds]
Baby girl, you coming around, I know you staying around me because you never wanna leave, bomboclat
And then I'll go in and out and then I hear your sound saying, I'm everything you need, ooh yeah
You wanna know where we can go?
All the way to Fernando
You wanna be my Nintendo?
But you gotta know I don't play no games

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Everything I say is true
I'd be a mess here without you
And I'll hold you down, you don't need to stress
So let me just lay upon your chest

[Chorus: Kojo Funds]

Roll the weed and let me smoke the sess

Roll the weed and let me smoke the sess
And you can lay upon my chest, aye ya

[Outro: Kojo Funds & RAYE]
There something in my ride
Baby, it's my big black 9
Hoping that it don't take your life
Baby, you will feel alright
Listen, baby girl, there's something in my ride (no, no, no)
Baby, it's my big black 9 (no, no, no)
Hoping that it don't take your life
Baby, you will feel alright, feel alright
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
