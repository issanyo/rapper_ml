[Intro: PnB Rock]
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Shawty, you been on my mind for so long
That I ain't gone waste no time now that we're all alone
Girl, I'm so glad you're mine and you know
That I'ma treat your body right from head to toe
'Cause it ain't nothing like lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
It ain't nothing like lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
It ain't nothing like lovin' you

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Loving you isn't easy
The thought about it make me sleepy
I was gone call then I got the wrong impression while thinking
Maybe I'm bugging, am I tweakin'?
Now that I'm on, it's gon' be a long time 'till they reach me
I left 'em hanging just for reaching
Picture going hard for somebody then they end up leaving
That mean you did it for no reason
Baby I'ma cuff you if I want to, fuck a season
If I cut you off, I swear you won't stop bleeding
I'll treat you how you want, show me how you want to be treated
If I touch you there I bet you won't stop leakin'

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Shawty, you been on my mind for so long
That I ain't gon' waste no time now that we're all alone
Girl, I'm so glad you're mine and you know
That I'ma treat your body right from head to toe
Cause it ain't nothing like lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
It ain't nothing like lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
It ain't nothing like lovin' you

[Bridge: PnB Rock]
You, you, you, you got me
I ain't gon' lie, you poppin
Anything you want, you can have it
Girl, you know that shit is automatic
Swerving, swerving
Girl, I swear you're so perfect
You make all these hoes nervous
Get it all 'cause you deserve it

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Yeah, I might put you on
Be my main jawn
Beat that thang down
Yeah, you love it when I fuck you with my chains on
Girl that pussy get so wet, be like a rain storm
Yeah, when I, when I skrr skrr
Yeah, I know you wanna ride when I skrr skrr
It don't matter where I'm at, you could be far from me
I'll be there in a minute if you callin' me, yeah

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Shawty, you been on my mind for so long
That I ain't gon' waste no time now that we're all alone
Girl, I'm so glad you're mine and you know
That I'ma treat your body right from head to toe
Cause it ain't nothing like lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
It ain't nothing like lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
It ain't nothing like lovin' you

[Outro: PnB Rock]
It ain't nothing like lovin' you
It ain't nothing like lovin' you, lo-, lo-
Lovin' you
Lovin' you
