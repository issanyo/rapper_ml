[Chorus 1]
I seen a lotta bitches get slid in and make me not want to be faithful to bitches
I did a lotta fucked up shit and I know I was wrong but just pray for a nigga
I look up at Quo
I wish I could look at my bro but now he keep a angel with niggas
Beastie you know
I'm goin' in on these niggas
I am not playin' with niggas
If I gotta go
I know that the rest of my niggas is gonna put pain on them niggas
I already know
Nothin' to say to them niggas
Just let it rain on them niggas
Just let it go
Go ahead and call me lil' nigga
I be with them gangsta lil' niggas
I fuck with my bros
I won't switch up on my niggas
I show love to all of my niggas

[Post-Chorus]
Can I come by, fuck what happened last night
I need good vibes, don't you give me bad vibes
Enemies that turned into my allies
I think I would die before I switched sides

[Verse 1]
I went to war with niggas, but we used to be friends though
You was my nigga
I wish the best for you even though you want me dead though
Melody need me
She gotta see me on TV, no nigga I can't go
I wasn't with it
I had to get it with niggas that thought I was scared though
Bitches be all on my dick but they never would notice me if I was dead broke
I used to be posted up right on that step with a stick
I was just like a scarecrow
Sosa was with me, he had a strap on him
You woulda thought it was Velcro
I was on 50 when niggas givin' out a buck 50 for damn coats
I had to grip it when they tried to catch me slippin'
Nigga, I was like "Hell, no"
I move a millie
I keep some gang members with me in every damn show
Up in my city
I keep a heater around 'cause I know how it gets cold
Bitches be tricky
I know that I can never put my trust in a damn hoe

[Chorus 2]
I seen a lotta bitches get slid in and make me not want to be faithful to bitches
I did a lotta fucked up shit and I know I was wrong but just pray for a nigga
I look up at Quo
I wish I could look at my bro but now he keep a angel with niggas
Beastie you know
I'm goin' in on these niggas
I am not playin' with niggas
If I gotta go
Rest of my niggas is gonna put pain on them niggas?
Let it rain on them niggas

[Verse 2]
I coulda went plain on the Patek but I had to flood it though
I coulda put S-sides on a Cuban but I'm gettin' money though
I gotta stay to myself
Niggas say that they gon' do shit but nigga I never know
I got a H on my belt and the band don't come with it, I gotta be color though
The VVS's on my chain, VVS's on me lookin' so colorful
VVS's on my ring, VVS's on the plane so colorful
Mike Amiri Billie Jean, red bottoms on the stage
I fuck it up
Drivin' 488s
Used to have to take the train, but fuck it though
Big safe, big face, big Wraith, nothing but big things
Big bank take lil' bank, nigga, but I be in big banks
Young MJ from where the Knicks play
Pull up with six rings
Ice on my arm like my wrist sprained
So many hoes I forget names

[Chorus 2]
I seen a lotta bitches get slid in and make me not want to be faithful to bitches
I did a lotta fucked up shit and I know I was wrong but just pray for a nigga
I look up at Quo
I wish I could look at my bro but now he keep a angel with niggas
Beastie you know
I'm goin' in on these niggas
I am not playin' with niggas
If I gotta go
Rest of my niggas is gonna put pain on them niggas?
Let it rain on them niggas
