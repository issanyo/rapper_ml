Back in my mode
She back in a mood
I think she a water sign
(Cool)
She's watching the waves crash
(Yeah)
We laid on the oceanside
She's loving the motions now
She catching them feels
(Yeah)
She love what I told her now
She know that it's real


Shout to the god
Baby I'm blessed
They love my potential
They know that I'm next
I keep it reject
100 percent
I stick and I move
The cause and effect
She's loving the motions now
She catching them feels
I show you the motions now
I gave you the chills


Baby i just hate to keep you waiting
Sorry if you ever had to wait on me
Baby i won't ever keep you waiting
Truth be told you ain't gotta wait on me


She getting them feels
Player playa and  the highlight reel
That's when we play it back, 1 more round
You see I'm winning like back to back
You know I'm gonna bet it on reject
Champions, ain't it ambient
Wanna get it on canvas then
It's a movie now
Better yet short film instead
If we made a movie it might never end
She's a bee sting when you get her mad
She's a queen bee and my better half
Just Like Yonce and the Jigga man
Start a beehive then we make the twins
See what honey do
When your comfortable
Turn 22 like a month ago
She got asian eyes
When she hit the kush
Just to concentrate
She don't like to smoke
Just to focus in
Cause she college bound
She a Cali girl not from Hollywood
She a loyal girl and a Yankee fan
If I met her mom I would kiss her hand
Then kiss her head take away the sins
Whisper in her ear then take a dance
And tell her this

Repeat Chorus
