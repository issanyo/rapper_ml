[Verse]
I'm still DTB, I'm nasty
I'll still hit it if you ask me
I'm not the type to wanna meet your family
I'm still interested in bitches that be scamming
I still look at bitches' pictures on the 'gram, yeah
I still liking all your pictures on the 'gram, yeah
And I look perfect gotta come in here
But I still want you girl, I swear

[Chorus]
I never care if i’m wrong or right
And I don’t care if you want you can use me
I wanna be the one there in your life
This Time

[Verse]
Been on the road for so long
Living places everyday, it’s so hard to control her
They don’t want to see her wedding ring
They want me to expose her
I gotta let a hater hate, yeah they just wanna see me so lost
They gotta free my nigga Cardinal, Dizzy nigga come home
Never be a follower, never be a bozo
I want you to acknowledge me don’t ever leave me unknown
You was there when I was dead, broke, and I was alone
Nike tech suit on the corner without a phone
Listening to Biggavelli tryna get better flows

[Chorus]
I never care if i’m wrong or right
And I don’t care if you want you can use me
I wanna be the one here in your life
This Time

[Outro]
I'm too beasty, you can never reach me
Ex-bitch fall back, it's okay I'm over that
Mike Amiri, Balmains, switch it up to foreign things
Dripped-out Hermes, I get in my Birkins
