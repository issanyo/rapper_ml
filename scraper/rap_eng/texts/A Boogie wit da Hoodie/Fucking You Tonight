You must be used to me spending
All that sweet wine and dining
I'm fucking you tonight
Another one and another one
Another one and another one
Another one and another one

[Verse 1: Don Q]
Sex on the first night, I can make it work right
I live a perc life, bet I make you squirt twice
Put you on your first flight out the country, we poppin' bubbly
Kinda chubby but I'm swagged up so she gotta love me
Pull up in the stretch Benz
I bet you wake up early tellin' all your best friends how we was flexin'
Down Collins, in my posse it ain't hard to find a thottie
Me and baby Abu Dhabi pull up rocking Avianne
Summer time Kawasaki, winter time Maserati
Hit a spot in Dyckman probably, it be different kind of mamis
We play up in them sheets, when we done you make it up
Make that pussy rest in peace, I kiss and wake it up
We head to Soho for a calm fit
Brown skinned Christina Milian on her arm shit
Back on the Don shit, the ring the alarm shit
That bag full of green, yeah that mowing the lawn shit
Don

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Some say I'm way too fly, I'm immaculate
Understand why you acting up
I wanna ask you something
If I wasn't rapping would, never mind girl
I don't know why some times I get mad at ya
Girl you so fine, girl you bad as fuck
Back shots and I slap your butt
I talk about it then I back it up, now back it up
Back it up
You the only one I wanna creep with
Keep it G with me, girl we can keep it a secret
Just at least come to the crib if you feel like eating
Givenchy sheets so you feel comfortable while you sleeping
I know you need somebody to rock with
To vibe with, somebody you could get fly with
Hop in my whip, I started off by the projects
Now I got shit, why I wouldn't be, be plottin'

You must be used to me spending
All that sweet wine and dining
I'm fucking you tonight
Another one and another one
Another one and another one
