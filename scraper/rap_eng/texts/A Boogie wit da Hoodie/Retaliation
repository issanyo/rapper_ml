[Chorus]
I left my shawty inside the basement
My .40 my shawty, I gotta name it
I tried to abort it but that's my baby
We got in multiple altercations
Always starts with a nigga hatin'
They got them boys investigatin'
They waitin' for a retaliation
They lookin' for a retaliation
They started up an investigation
Started off with a nigga hatin'
Shawty got into an altercation
I tried to abort it but that's my baby
My .40 my shawty, I gotta name it
I'm with my shawty inside the basement
And we lookin' for a retaliation
They lookin' for a retaliation

[Verse]
I'm hearin' rumors, a lot of rumors
Word on the streets is that I'm a shooter
They lookin' for reasons to send me to precincts
That wasn't no weed, I was smokin' hookah
My shawty a diva, I love to screw her
I put it in deep and then I maneuver
She listens to me when I'm talkin' to her
I wish I knew her before I knew her
I wish that I knew her 'fore I started fuckin' with bitches
That can't even say they love me
Couple niggas I grew up with don't even fuck with me no more
It's probably because of money
You switchin' your crew up, you ain't livin' comfortable nigga
You know you a fuckin' dummy
I'm rollin' that glue up and it's gettin' stuck to my fingers
Can somebody roll it for me?
I'm done with the percies, I gave it up
'Cause nobody else would have gave a fuck
I pray for niggas that hated us
Yeah, I got me a bag and I ran it up
I got me a check and then I had to flex on bitches
That said I wasn't good enough
I got me a weapon, yeah, I had to check them niggas
That said I wasn't hood enough
They tried to bet on it
I had to double the money them niggas was puttin' up
They think I got it nigga
I ain't plottin', I'm walkin' around with my hoodie up
I wear designer of course
I got a lot of it, check out my Louis stuff
I always wanted a Porsche
Now I can walk off the lot with like two of them

[Chorus]
I left my shawty inside the basement
My .40 my shawty, I gotta name it
I tried to abort it but that's my baby
We got in multiple altercations
Always starts with a nigga hatin'
They got them boys investigatin'
They waitin' for a retaliation
They lookin' for a retaliation
They started up an investigation
Started off with a nigga hatin'
Shawty got into an altercation
I tried to abort it but that's my baby
My .40 my shawty, I gotta name it
I'm with my shawty inside the basement
And we lookin' for a retaliation
They lookin' for a retaliation
