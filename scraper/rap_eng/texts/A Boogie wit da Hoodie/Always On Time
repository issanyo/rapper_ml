[Intro: A Boogie]
Only time I'm feeling fine is when I'm with my
Only time I'm feeling fine is when I'm with my bitch

[Chorus: A Boogie]
We ride together, we ride together, be honest
The only time I'm feeling fine is when I'm with my bitch
And she always on time forever
That's why she my ride or die
She hate it when I call her my bitch but she mine forever
And whenever the time is, I make time whenever regardless
She always on time, my nigga, regardless
She always on time, that's why I

[Verse 1: A Boogie]
Wrote you cause I just wanted to see you
Pull up on me, girl, I wanna eat you
Nah, nah I'm playin', don't really need you
Once you turn into someone they wanna be you
I grew up bumpin' Cassidy and Beanie Siegel
Watchin' crack heads squeeze up on that needle
I said I'm sorry for makin' you feel I need you
Love hoes, windows, bitch you see through
Smokin' endo outdoors with my people
I don't eat cheese, my nigga, no that's illegal
I don't like dogs who fuck with you when they need you
Y'all are not low, my nigga, already peeped you
I do not know you, don't say wassup to me
When I needed it, you didn't show no love to me
Don't want no company
Fuck you, fuck you, aha!

[Chorus: A Boogie]
We ride together, we ride together, be honest
The only time I'm feeling fine is when I'm with my bitch
And she always on time forever
That's why she my ride or die
She hate it when I call her my bitch but she mine forever
And whenever the time is, I make time whenever regardless
She always on time, my nigga, regardless
She always on time, that's why I

[Verse 2: Snoopy Dinero]
Love her to death, give her nothin' to stress
Focused on when I'm strokin', she feel it all in her chest, ah!
Pussy so wet, kissin' up on her neck
Wanna scream my name, she keep it under her breath, ah!
Ah! I'm still the same, my nigga
My niggas, we still ridin' with the thang, my nigga
My niggas, we get that money, never change, my nigga
My niggas will never switch up for no fame, my nigga like...
Stackin' to the ceilin'
And when you all alone and you all up in your feelings
You can listen to this, thug nigga who just missin' a bitch
I take your hoe by the flick of the wrist
And she like to call me by my government
Cause it make her feel special
Hit that thing raw just to make her feel special
Several phone calls just to make her feel special
Do that think I like cause you know I still let you, ah!

[Chorus]
We ride together, we ride together, be honest
The only time I'm feeling fine is when I'm with my bitch
And she always on time forever
That's why she my ride or die
She hate it when I call her my bitch but she mine forever
And whenever the time is, I make time whenever regardless
She always on time, my nigga, regardless
She always on time, that's why I

[Verse 3: A-Boogie]
Ah! Girl pull up on me
You know I wanna know if you could pull up on me
Can I put it in your spine while you kissin' on me?
Matter of fact, never mind, that's a different story
I be playin', girl you know how I play with you
Can I, pull up to your crib? Girl I just wanna lay with you
I show you how I live, I don't wanna be fake with you
Cause I know how it feels for someone to be fake with you
And I'm feelin' you, and I know it's killin' you
You don't wanna say it, but you feelin' me too
Don't worry 'bout them niggas and don't worry 'bout them bitches
Baby we don't gotta tell nobody shit that we do, that we do
And that's just how it's 'posed to be
You got your girls with you, I got my woes with me
And I could tell you want me by how you approachin' me
I will show nobody nothin' that you show with me cause

[Outro: A Boogie]
We ride together, we ride together, be honest
The only time I'm feelin' fine is when I'm with my bitch
And she always on time forever
That's why she my ride or die
She hate it when I call her my bitch, but she mine forever
And whenever the time is, I make time whenever
Regardless, regardless, that's why I...ne Forever
And Whenever The Time Is I Make Time Whenever
Regardless, Regardless, That's Why I !
