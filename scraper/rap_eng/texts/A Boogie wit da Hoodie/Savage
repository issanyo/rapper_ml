[Intro]
The Atomix

[Chorus]
I always thought my last bitch would be my last bitch
'Til I found out she was a savage (Savage)
I ain't have shit, but that was back then (That was back then)
Now I'm established, I got mad drip, yeah (Mad drip)
Fuck love, that shit don't belong here
Wish I knew the devil was so pretty with the long hair
Yeah, fuckin' with three niggas at a time, damn
I'm just hopin' that the kid ain't mine, yeah, mmh

[Verse]
Tippy toes
Tall bitch, she make me get up on my tippy toes
When I hit it up
She like she don't fuck with Henny, though
But I put the '42 up in her anyway and she get litty-ed up, yeah
All the petty hoes
Sneak up in the section next to me so they can be in videos, yeah
You already know
My Westside niggas flex with me, they TTG, they trained to go (Gang)
Throw it up like LeBron now
Forty to your spine, make you calm down (Calm down)
Feel like young black Bruce Wayne, black whips out
My niggas is used to robbin', they still rob now
And you can smell the gas through the plastic (Plastic)
Damn, I always thought my last bitch would be my last bitch, yeah
Somethin' 'bout that ass, I swear she wasn't average, yeah
Make it hard for me to tell you was a savage
Actin' so shy
Dressed in chess, like these Gucci shoes with the socks
Get paranoid, I look over my shoulder a lot
Traumatized, fuckin' ratchet hoes on the block
I'm traumatized, that's why I hate my past
Now I dress up, they wanna take my swag, yeah
Whole different bracket, Cartier my glasses
Tryna ride my wave, I'll make you lose your balance
Say that you a gangster but don't move in silence
Yeah, I don't fuck around with Instagrammers
I can't be lacking, keep at least one hammer, yeah
Won't get jammed up by no bitch, I swear, I did

[Chorus]
I always thought my last bitch would be my last bitch
That's until I found out she was a savage (Savage)
I ain't have shit, but that was back then (That was back then)
Now I'm established, I got mad drip, yeah
Fuck love, that shit don't belong here (Belong here)
Wish I knew the devil was so pretty with the long hair (Long hair)
Yeah, fuckin' with three niggas at a time, damn (Uh)
I'm just hopin' that the kid ain't mine, yeah (Ain't mine)

[Outro]
I'm just hopin' that it ain't mine, yeah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, yeah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, yeah
I'm just hopin' that it ain't mine, yeah
I've been doing things, I'm so wrong, yeah
Three bitches at the same time, yeah
I'm feelin' basic, run, yeah
