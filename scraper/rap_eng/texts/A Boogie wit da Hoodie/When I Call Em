[Pre-Chorus : Ebenezer]
They say don't let the money change you
I still kick it with the same crew
All my niggas poppin' they my day ones
You kinda mad because it ain't you
We get it poppin' (dun know)
And we get it poppin' (dun know)
And we keep it poppin' (dun know)
That we keep it poppin'

[Chorus : Ebenezer]
Loyalty that's what we call it
So they come when I call 'em
So they come when I call 'em
So they come when I call 'em
Loyalty that's what we call it
So they come when I call 'em
So they come when I call 'em
So they come when I call 'em

[Verse 1 : Ebenezer]
Trust, find it hard to trust
Money and these drugs made these bitches fall in love
Am I on the Northside, am I with the doorboys?
Am I with the ballers? Girl, you know it's your choice
'Cause I'm, tryna finesse on you you ain't even gotta ask twice
But I need loyalty, girl you gotta act right
So pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it
Please don't make assumptions, you know I got options

[Pre-Chorus : Ebenezer]
They say don't let the money change you
I still kick it with the same crew
All my niggas poppin' they my day ones
You kinda mad because it ain't you
We get it poppin' (dun know)
And we get it poppin' (dun know)
And we keep it poppin' (dun know)
That we keep it poppin'

[Chorus : Ebenezer]
Loyalty that's what we call it
So they come when I call 'em
So they come when I call 'em
So they come when I call 'em
Loyalty that's what we call it
So they come when I call 'em
So they come when I call 'em
So they come when I call 'em

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
When you come through I be taking your phone, 'cause I don't need no one recording me
You said that you wanted me all alone but you brought your friend and she all on me
Fuck it we all could just get in the zone, I could turn sex to a melody
I know you wanted a nigga to save you, too bad that it ain't you
I know you wonderin' when I'm a sweet dude, don't feel like I hate you
I can make my schedule flexible, 'cause just the way you neck me is incredible
I can put you on a flight to Mexico, are you loyal to me 'cause I never know

[Pre-Chorus : Ebenezer]
They say don't let the money change you
I still kick it with the same crew
All my niggas poppin' they my day ones
You kinda mad because it ain't you
We get it poppin' (dun know)
And we get it poppin' (dun know)
And we keep it poppin' (dun know)
That we keep it poppin'

[Chorus : Ebenezer]
Loyalty that's what we call it
So they come when I call 'em
So they come when I call 'em
So they come when I call 'em
Loyalty that's what we call it
So they come when I call 'em
So they come when I call 'em
So they come when I call 'em
