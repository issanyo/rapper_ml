[Intro: Kehlani]
Crazy
I go, I go, I go

[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Everything I do, I do it with a passion
If I gotta be a bitch, I'ma be a bad one
I'm AI with the designs, du-ragging
Bounce back game good, why we talkin' practice?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Pull up score when I want to
Best thing next to Heaven
They be tryna count me out though
I'm just countin', countin' blessins
A real woman 'bout her paper
Niggas don't know where I came from
Why I really really came up
You never could say I'm back in
All this shit I've been through and it made me more of an assassin
I kill 'em, I kill 'em, I kill 'em with compassion
And baby if they askin'

[Hook: Kehlani]
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
Live for the challenge, only make me stronger
One more reason to turn up on 'em
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Do you think I'm crazy?
I spent over 80 on a watch and a bracelet
I'm like an alien, fuck a Mercedes
I came in a spaceship, donâ€™t call me crazy
I was stuck in a basement with a pen and a paper
Lost the eraser, I made a mistake and I told you I hate ya
Everything I do, I do it cause I never had shit
A couple niggas tried to screw me over, had to learn how to use a ratchet
A couple bitches had me fucked up, had to learn how to be a savage
Had to learn not to fuck with her just because she was the baddest
These streets don't love no one, don't get caught up in traffic
I just wanna smoke one so can you roll up and pass it
I love Louis fabric, I just bought a jacket
20 something hundred more than your casket
I kill 'em with swagness, my bitch is the baddest

[Hook: Kehlani]
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
Live for the challenge, only make me stronger
One more reason to turn up on 'em
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy

[Outro]
I go, I go, I go, I go, crazy, crazy
I go, I go, I go, I go, crazy, crazy
