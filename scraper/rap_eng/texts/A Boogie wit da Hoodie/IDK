Like why you so fly? (I don't know)
Like why you so high? (I don't know)
Like why them niggas staring at you so hard every time you ride by? (I don't know)
Like why you so thurl? (I don't know)
Why you fuck that nigga's girl? (I don't know)
Why you smoke all that dope, why you kill all them shows
Everybody wanna know, everybody wanna know
How you do that (I don't know)
How you do that (I don't know)
How you do that (I don't know)
How you do that (I don't know)
How you do that (I don't know)
Like how you do that (I don't know)
How you do that (I don't know)
Ooh tell me how you do that shit (I don't know)
They wanna know how I do that shit

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I heard a couple niggas tryna line me
It ain't hard to find me
I got a couple killers right behind me
And if they catch a body, I swear I won't tell nobody
I got Balmain on my body, diamonds dancing on my body
Muller cooler than your jeweler, Elliot Avianne
She wanna fuck while my song play
I wanna know why they salty
I had to get it the hard way
Yeah nigga that's what they all say
I had to give up on college
I would've been trapping in hallways
I'm ballin', you know you can't stop it
Crossover, get 'em off me
I ain't got time for this shit, I'm a monster at this, nigga I grind for this shit
I can't just sleep with a bitch, you gotta watch who you hit, first get the drop on a bitch
Louis Vuitton on my hip, forty-five on my hip
PnB Rock with me nigga, you know we be fly as a bitch

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Everybody wanna know now, everybody wanna know how
How a young nigga came up, I'm supposed to be broke now
Coming through looking like I hit a lick
Dare you to try me cause I got that stick
Killing these haters, I'm making them sick
I just bought some new Chanel for my bitch
Bands all in my pockets
I'm taking off like a rocket
I'm the plug, no socket
I need all my profits
I need all my checks
Bitches on me cause they know I'm next
She just sent a naked picture through the text
I don't want the pussy, I just want the neck
All I know is flex, diamonds on my neck
I'm the fuckin' best, nigga what's the bet?
I just copped a new laser for this TEC
Treat you like a bitch, pussy you get wet
Cause I ain't got time to be playin' with y'all
You from where I'm from then you know that it's hard
I swear I told y'all that I'm not a star
It's still fuck the law and free all of my dogs
