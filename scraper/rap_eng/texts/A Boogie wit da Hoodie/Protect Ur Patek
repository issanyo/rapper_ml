[Intro: Don Q]
You better protect
You better protect
Y'all know my rep
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Don Q]
You better protect your Patek
You better protect your Patek
You better protect your Patek
You better protect your Patek

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
You better protect your Patek
This ain't a diss or a threat
I'm talking nothing but facts
If they ain't feeling me yet
Tell them pardon my back
I was on 165th on the west of the X
Where they hustlers and killers be at
Plus it was rats
Matter of fact
I don't even wanna get into that

[Verse 2: Don Q]
You better protect your Patek
I hope you never forget
I put my set on the jet
I can't accept nothing less
Niggas talking about death on the net
But I don't be checking for threats
Homie told me that he slept on the steps
So he had to dead the connect
I'm probably collecting a check
Pouring up, measuring tech
This is finesse at its best
I don't know what's on my schedule next
I'm focused on seeing my revenue stretch

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
You tryna save her
Like you got an S on your chest
Well I got a check on my neck
I hit it one time and she called me
I never accept
I fucked her and left her depressed
Presidential on my wrist
Won't argue with a bitch
I don't wanna listen to that
She just took me out the VIP
And necked me in the whip
While I got a friend in the back
Like yeah

[Verse 4: Don Q]
I'm hearing rumors and gossip
They saying Q is a topic
But I just flew to the tropics
My shoes is exotic
My coup√© is robotic
I swear that these niggas is too outta pocket
And I can't help but address it
You see the legends, respect It
So how could you peasants neglect it
I came out the gate and I said I'm the best in the X
And I'm setting the record
It's just me and A
We match up a check
On Pateks and we very protected

[Verse 5: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
Just me and Don
I might need another hundred on my arm
Might need another hundred on my neck
Keep it a hundred when you in the Bronx
I think she feeling me now
But I cannot remember her name
How you my enemy now?
And before we was sharing a plate?

[Verse 6: Don Q]
None of this money get took for granted
Gave me a shot and I took advantage
Got off my feet and they couldn't stand it
Yeah I got that dope in the hood, it stink
Nigga you thinking 'bout pressing me
I hope you don't think I got shit comparing
They pulled me over
Tryna question me
I was drunk at the light and I should've ran
Coming out dodging a felony
Bagging up work was a specialty
I'll really kill for the legacy
I'm not your average celebrity

[Verse 7: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
Don't let me get outta character
We breaking all of the barriers
We gon' pull up and embarrass ya
Mask on nigga scarier
Money no joke
But on my way to the bank
It be feeling hilarious
Said he a goon
If you got on a Patek
He might just go on and snatch it off

[Interlude: Rowdy Rebel]
We getting that 50 back
But be soon as we go to Vegas
I keep an eye on the nosy neighbors
Got some new toys for the home invaders

[Bridge: Don Q]
You better protect
You better protect
Y'all know my rep
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Don Q]
You better protect your Patek
You better protect your Patek
You better protect your Patek
You better protect your Patek
