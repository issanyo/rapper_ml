[Intro]
And I'm just giving you the real, hmm
I swear these niggas be so temporary
Bitches be so temporary
I'm just giving you the real
You gotta listen I don't think they hear me
Turn it up cause I don't think they hear me
Let me tell you how I feel

[Verse 1]
I heard loyalty is everything and shit
But where she at, I swear to God
I never seen that bitch
They say they love me, I promise
I don't believe that shit
Cause they be faking it
Saying it like they mean that shit
I hate that, why you want the truth
If you can't face that
I be keeping that shit a thousand
I give 'em straight facts
Time is money, money is time
And you can't replace that
If everything I tell you Is real and how you gon' fake that
And I ain't saying niggas is different
But yeah it's different
And a lot of niggas say they official
Really be bitches
Just keep a small circle if not
Just stay independent cause niggas is quick
To switch up and go missing
And they will never go that hard with you
Never go that far with you
How you gon' let a nigga eat
And he ain't starve with you
Prolly take break the law with you
Never take the charge with you
Watch you slip up
They will never take the fall with you

[Chorus]
Temporary, bitches be so temporary
I'm just giving you the real
You gotta listen I don't think they hear me
Turn it up cause I don't think they hear me
Let me tell you how I feel
I swear these niggas be so temporary
Bitches be so temporary
I'm just givin' you the real, you gotta listen
I don't think they hear me
Turn it up cause I don't think they hear me
Let me tell you how I feel

[Verse 2]
So now I'm walking in the rain
With my Timbs on stepping over
Puddles full of pain
All my friends gone, some in jail
Other niggas changed like a Drake song
I just feel like nothing was the same
But I'm going and I'm scoring
And Iâ€™m just making that shit count
When I gave these niggas chances
They kept turning that shit down
Yeah they say they fucking with me
They just say that shit right now
But when I turn around
They nowhere to be found
And I ain't with the drama (drama)
I ain't with drama
I know these bitches temporary
When I see em I say hi and bye
I don't need em I say hi and bye
I say As-Salaam-Alaikum
They gon tell me Walaikum Salaam
They gon tell me Walaikum Salaam
It's the same with these niggas
That be saying they gon' ride or die
When I know they ain't gon ride or die
I fuck around and let that choppa fly

[Chorus]
Temporary, bitches be so temporary
I'm just giving you the real
You gotta listen I don't think they hear me
Turn it up cause I don't think they hear me
Let me tell you how I feel
I swear these niggas be so temporary
Bitches be so temporary
I'm just givin' you the real, you gotta listen
I don't think they hear me
Turn it up cause I don't think they hear me
Let me tell you how I feel

[Verse 3]
Just because they day one
That don't make em A1
Real recognize real, nigga I can't mistake one
I just keep it pushing when I run into a fake one
You know loyalty is everything until my fucking day come
Ain't it crazy how them niggas say they fucking with ya
Grab a pistol, bust it with ya
You go to work, they at ya crib tryna fuck ya sister
The ones close to you will do the most you
If it's bread on ya head I'll bet
They put that toaster to you
They look at you and smile though go half
With you on a bottle
Sip Hennessy and Moscato I ain't even 'gon lie tho
That's word to my nigga Quado
Rest in peace my nigga Quado
They call you bro and then leave you in the cold like Chicago
First they hate you then they love you
Then they, turn into a snake again
No new niggas, I'll never make that mistake again
They start off real cool, but once you see that they faking it
Take a picture nigga you might never see they face again

[Chorus]
Temporary, bitches be so temporary
I'm just giving you the real
You gotta listen I don't think they hear me
Turn it up cause I don't think they hear me
Let me tell you how I feel
I swear these niggas be so temporary
Bitches be so temporary
I'm just givin' you the real, you gotta listen
I don't think they hear me
Turn it up cause I don't think they hear me
Let me tell you how I feel

[Outro]
Let me tell you how I feel, yeah
Let me tell you how I feel, yeah
And I'm just giving you the real
And I'm just giving you real
Let me tell you how I feel, yeah
Let me tell you how I feel, yeah
And I'm just giving you the real
And I'm just giving you real
