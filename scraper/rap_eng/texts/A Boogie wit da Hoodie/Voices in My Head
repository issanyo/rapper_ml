[Intro]
Monsta's gon’ tear it up

[Verse 1]
All she ever wanted was my heart to hurt
No attachments, just a Gucci purse
She know I'm mad rich, she think I'm usin’ her
My diamonds Mavericks, they so blue to her
And the way I'm actin' is all due to her
If I think she thottin', I'm gon' do it first
I'm gon' call my side bitch and we gon’ do the work
She know I’m from Highbridge, my chain show through the shirt
The feds locked my man up, free Montana
Damn, all he ever wanted was his bands up
They gave him 10 years for nothin', keep your head up
If any niggas start to fret, nigga, lay ’em out
Just listen to all my tracks
'Cause I don't wanna do no interviews, I'm not into that
And I be feelin’ like I'm Malcolm, I got the X on my back
And every nigga in the X can vouch for me, that's a fact
I dropped my first mixtape and yeah, that shit ran laps
By the time I dropped The Bigger Artist, like seven million in plaques
Got too much gold, I'm way too smart to leave my crib without straps
And any nigga run up on us gon' get hit like that
And I'ma be like nigga started what I started
Skinny nigga with a Patek and a Pyrex
Any nigga could get embarrassed, come and try it
Any nigga could get a bad bitch, just go and buy shit

[Chorus]
I know, I know
You're just like all the bitches I know
Why do you know all the bitches I know?
I think we're better off as rivals, yeah
I know, I know
Why do you know all the bitches I know?
You're just like all the bitches I know
You're just like all my fuckin' rivals, yeah

[Verse 2]
And I know, I know
You're just like all the bitches I know
Insecure, so you got that lipo
I feel like I'm the rappin' Michael, yeah
I think I'm better off without you
And you think I don't know about the things you do
But I do all the same fuckin' things you do
We are both the same, I am just like you, yeah
I know that you get in your feelings, baby, me too
Sometimes I swear I say some shit that I don't mean to
I make you feel a type of way, I make you evil
When I was broke, they used to treat me like I'm see-through
They killed my nigga Quado in the projects
And then they killed Beasty, free PeeWee
I swear to God, somebody better die next
And if it's one of my niggas, nigga, free me
