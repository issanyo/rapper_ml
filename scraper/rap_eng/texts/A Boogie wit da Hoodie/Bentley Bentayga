[Intro]
I was broke before don't give a fuck now (Guess what?)
I got all this elliante  bust down now
Now I make 100 on a bad day, yeah
Now I make 100 on a bad day, yeah
Now I see these niggas tryna ride waves, yeah
Now I see these bitches and they sad faced, yes
But they used to never write me back, ayy-yeah
Run up on me get hit with the tech, ayy

[Verse 1]
Skeleton, AP me and my bros, that’s a bust down
I don't like new niggas on the road, I'm from up town
Everywhere I go they be like goals, I’ma icon
Twistin' on my feet and my new shoes I'm like Mike, ahh
Now which one of these weapons should I choose with the spikes on?
I watch all of my diamonds glitter blue when the lights off
I might cop another watch and then go shit on my haters
They don't wanna take it 'cause they know shit could get dangerous
Bubba lost like 50K before I even been to Vegas
I go 180 on the freeway
I'm in a Bentley Bentayga

[Refrain]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
If one of my niggas get they chain snatched, then go get that nigga
Don't you bring your ass to Highbridge until you get that nigga
I don't wanna promote violence, but go kill that nigga
I don’t wanna promote violence, but go kill that nigga
The FN go right through you, you don’t wanna be next to that nigga
Dressed in Enfant Riches, I might be the freshest in it nigga
They love how I switch my damn flows on pianos
They think they can fuckin' send shots, they need ammo
I feel like a fuckin’ rockstar, I don't dance though
I don't wanna play with Glocks nah, let's go rambo
I ain’t worried about no cop car, you're  too damn slow
I ain't worried about no opp nah, let his man's know
