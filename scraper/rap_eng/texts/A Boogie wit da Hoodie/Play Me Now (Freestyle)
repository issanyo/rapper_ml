[Intro]
30, you a fool for this one

[Verse]
I dare you, try to play me now
I dare you, try to play me now
Before, I couldn't really tell you shit
But I got mad shit to tell you now
Couple racks on some petty shit
For a bag, she gon' do it all, ooh
She keep lyin' on some petty shit
Talk about what she don't do no more
You know, girl, you really do the most
You just wanna run around with your girls
And talk about how I run around with the bros
When I already know how this shit goes, yeah
Think I'm addicted to the money, ooh
I ain't sayin' that it's true, but I do
Ooh, yeah
Like na, na-na, na
And I swear to God
Any nigga try to touch my chain gon' die
50 shots like ra, ra, ra
And they won't ever catch me lackin'
Young Bronx nigga came with a ratchet
9 bands on a Gucci jacket
But my heart so cold, this shit feel like plastic
I can tell you a little somethin' 'bout some trap shit
But you don't wanna go there, yeah, shit get nasty
I can tell you and you still savage
I can tell you really good at actin'
I know you want the one who run it up, ooh
I can tell you ain't used to a thug, ooh
And you told me that you lookin' for love, ooh
I can't lie, at first I wanted to fuck you
Look, I can't lie, at first I wanted to fuck you
I told you to hit me I was like, "Come through"
I probably bought everything at Louis Vuitton, ooh
I got the bag, got the hoodies, I got the duffels
Money can't make that nigga
Money don't make that nigga, don't hate that nigga
If I pull up in a Maybach, nigga
Please don't hate that, nigga

[Outro]
And they won't ever catch me lackin'
Young Bronx nigga came with a ratchet
9 bands on a Gucci jacket
But my heart so cold, this shit feel like plastic
I can tell you a little somethin' 'bout some trap shit
But you don't wanna go there, yeah, shit get nasty
I can tell you and you still savage
I can tell you really good at actin'
