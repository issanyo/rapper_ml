[Verse]
I remember when we was like 12 we went through hell, yo
Back when niggas was getting they biggies and they belts, so
Bitches used to curve me, used to swerve me nigga now look
They ain't never want me now they askin' to get they nails done
I know I smell like dope, they gassin' me, tellin' me I smell good
Pass me the pussy I pass it to my homie real quick
Audacity to ask me about the bitches that I still fuck
Audacity to ask me about the bitches that I still fuck
Your ass is lookin' fat, them
