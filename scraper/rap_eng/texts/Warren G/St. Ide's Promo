Back up, back up cause it's on
Can you do what we do when we sipping on the brew
Back up, back up cause it's on
Can you do what we do when we sipping on the brew


Conjunction, junction what's my assumption
I'm sipping on the St. Ide's Brew
That's my function
One for the money
Two for the Brew
It's the L.B. to the C. with the G-funk crew
Ooh
What would you do when we do
What we do when we sipping on the brew
Grab the deuce deuce or a forty-ounce
Dipping through the hood bumping more bounce
I see some P's on they knees
So I turn around on threes
Jumps my ride, checks my Dz
Dz on down to the spot where my knots made
Cause I don't like to dream about getting paid
Fade in the wind
Now it's on again
Heads to the side
Scooped the twinz
Everything is smooth on the eastside
Party on deck I'm drinking St. Ide's
Yeah
