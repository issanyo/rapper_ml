Song: So Many Ways (Remix)

Hey, nah ya goin miss up on the G-Funk era
Ya know we said things won for Warren G, and soon turned superstar

11-10-70 that was my intro
But now I'm makin doe, I'm rollin a 64
Cuz things get shady where the grass is greener
Brotha throwin up sets in hoods like they neva seen a
Young mack daddy do his thing cuz I pack right
I got 44 ways to make you act right
And its a shame how the game must be played
It was told never fold by the brothas you can't fade
So raise up off this young hog
Cuz I heard you punkin some but you can't punk me y'all
I got my own thang cuz I let my beat swang
If you wanna bring it, bring it on no pain no gain
So as I creep can you peep what I speak
Techniques unique, so what you sayin is obsolete
So there it is as I go about my days
I can only bring it to you like this in so many ways

(Chorus)

I'm bein true,ain't no fakin wit me
Brothas plottin on me, tryin to test if I can see
But I'm peepin out the scene for the peeps who give me props
For stayin out that madness, you know it ain't goin stop
In so many ways I let em know, in so many ways I let it flow
But you still dont hear me doe
So I'm a break it down cuz its quite elementary
This is for the homeys in the penetentiary
AB, Baby Poppa, Big Arch from the block
And the homey Jay Dogg, stay down cuz you's a hog
I got plenty love, and homey love stays
I can only bring it to you like this, in so many ways

(Chorus)

I stay true to the game
But some stay blind to the fact
That if I don't look good, you dont look good
So please rearrange and change the thangs you doin
You playin yourself cuz you the ones gettin screwed
As I, ease on down the rick road
As I shift from first to second, cruise control
So swack up the doja
Cuz I got the drink, and dont think
We dont roll without a full tank
Of that bomb, that we call the funk
Cuz I am the G and the funk is what you want
Now, lets take a trip to the other side of town
Brothas flip flop and they neva stay down
Wanna be all they can be, but gettin held back
Tryin to take what is mine, (what) what type of lick is that?
So, this is for the homies stay down for your pay
I can't only bring it to you like this in so many ways

(Chorus)
