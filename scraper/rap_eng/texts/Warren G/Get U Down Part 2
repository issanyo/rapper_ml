(Intro, Warren G)
This song is dedicated to all my people
That was caught up in hurricane Katrina
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama
We ridin with y'all
You know what I'm sayin?
I feel your pain
We gon' make it through this y'all
Yeah
Come on

(Verse 1, Warren G)
We here today, then gone tomorrow
It's got me singin a Marvin Gaye song
It made me wanna holla
So I hop in my Impala
Just to cruise, shake my blues
It's hard to follow
Hard to swallow what they sayin on the news
Good Lord, it's a crazy world
Watchin cops puttin cuffs on a five year old girl
Racism, racism, got our babies in the system
Mom and daddies in the prison
That's intention, no division
They the ones that's all you got
They keep the families divided
Keep it gangsta, keep it real
That's all I hear, but I dont buy it
When it's Revolution time, all these fool's will keep quiet
Like shhhh, you can-you can hear a pin drop
Can't go to one-ten cuz I might get popped
People shootin on the freeway, when will it stop?
But stay strong, cause the rain don't last
And push the war up in 'em, will fix the price on gas

(Hook, Side Effect)
Don't let nobody, no-o-o one
Get you doooowwwwnnnnn
Cause if they do, if they do
I'll be arouuuunnnndddd

(Verse 2, Ice Cube)
Why the black and the brown got to fight in the Pen
The black and the brown, they squabbin again
Them God damned sheriffs, is laughin again
It all stink, keep yo ass out the wind
See the black and the brown, we can share the same land
When I was a slave, where the hell did I ran?
California man, it was full of mexi-cans
Look mu-fasa, this is they casa
Just, kick back and enjoy the sunshine
Live ya life, stay away from one-time
Get'cha money man, find the lunch line
This ain't a joke, homie where's the punch line?
The ghetto is a trap homie, take the cheese
Soon as you do it, here come the police
Invented and designed for us to fail
Homie, don't you end up dead or in jail

(Hook)
Don't let nobody, no-o-o one
Get you doooowwwwnnnnn
Cause if they do, if they do
I'll be arouuuunnnndddd

(Verse 3, B-Real)
What's really good?
What's really hood?
What's really goin on?
Open your eyes and ears
Wipin your eyes from tears
From all the lies and fears
People get blinded here
Let me define it clear
You gotta cross the bed
Tell 'em some thoughts, oppressed
Someone who flosses there
You gettin lost in there
Homie they cost they fares
Niggas get bought and passed
Tell us, get caught somewhere
Never get tortured, kid
I heard the shot from there
Hit on the spot, from where
Right on the street, prepared
Levels of heat, you there
Spit at my feet, I swear
I will retreat, for years
People deceive the peers
Make you believe the cheers
But underneath the smears
I keep switchin gears
Fall in my sleep, I wear
For all the seekin shake
You got a dime to spare?
You sound so sincere
You're bottom line, bitch yea
You sound so sincere

(Hook)

(Verse 4, Snoop Dogg)
I try to do right
I don't wanna do wrong
I'm doin better things
Man, I wanna live long
Ain't too many fools out there harder than me
I love football so much, man I started a league
Oh what a pity, is made for the inner city
Used to be dark, but now the park's real pretty
Lil' boys outside, throwin footballs
In the hood y'all
Hey Snoop Dogg, how could y'all?
Let 'em pass instead of blast
The football field is a class
And I'mma teach ya, teach ya my lesson
Shotgun formation, no Smithson, no Wesson
The haters keep stressin
And everybody wanna ask me the question
Hey Boss Dogg, how you feel now?
You helpin out the kids, and they still hatin on ya, wow!

(Outro, Warren G)
You know what I'm sayin
There's a lot goin on in this world
But we gotta keep on pushin and movin and groovin
You know what I'm sayin?
Yea, even though we got these hard times
We still gotta keep it steady, ya know?
Keep pushin
So I want y'all to ride with me and cha-cha to this

Dedicated to my people out there strugglin (Stay strong)
Single parents, nine-to-five, steady hustlin (Stay strong)
College students workin hard to be somethin (Stay strong)
Anybody makin somethin out of nothin (Stay strong)
Dedicated to my people on lock down (Stay strong)
Anybody lost somebody, wish they still around (Stay strong)
To all the soldiers fighting for us on foreign ground (Stay strong)
To one and all, turn them frowns upside down

(Hook)
