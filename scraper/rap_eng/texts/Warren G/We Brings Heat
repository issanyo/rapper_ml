G-Child-
Playaz, playettes, macks, trues, wannabes
All you muthafuckaz, we gonna kick it like this
For the trues

Jah Skills-
Yeah this crew was tight, went from planning dreams
Now we rockin mics, gettin shit right, stayin on beat
And servin this heat, through yo streets, jealous hoes peep
But me, I dont sleep
So you know I catch you watchin
While they comin with drama, I'm blockin and steady knockin
The post is won out the box, it dont stop, hittin our areas and shakin up spots

Warren G-
I'm bakin blocks in four wheel motion
Everywhere I look I see 21 ones floatin (21st Street!)
Then I made a stop at the P-A-C's
Wassup y'all? You seen Tripp L-O double C, now
I'm headin to the back where the homeys is posted
Niggas on gat in case plat wanna get roasted
But you know how that go, in the city of snakes, fakes, hmm and bitch brakes
I shakes, back to the topic called heat
My beat, your treat, can't nobody fuck wit me
Cuz I'm known from Cali to Rome
We brings heat, so now its on

Chorus 2x
Bring heat to the table and play your cards right
My crew got heat we got game air tight

Knee-Hi-
Through thick and thin, see we like kin
And it won't stop no matter what happens
Man you not knowin, who's tops they be blowin
I brings heat, independant and I will release
The ultraviolet, bangin beats for the pilot
Got the sky lit now who really wanna try it
Its warm when we swarm, your area gonna get torn
And a job that work g funk in the purest form
For what its worth, I'm a let you know
I'm hyperactive for those who react too slow, all alone
My fleets movin fast,  hand in hand with the aftermath
My skills was built to last

Wayniac-
Forever in a day, but some days we gotta trip
Throwin lics for grits, steady stackin our chips
The money clips dont fit, now is it the way we dip on
These and those, mo Gs and hoes, I assumes on a mission, (on a mission)
Conditions ain't the same got the average nigga wishin, but still missin
The simple facts it ain't like that
Turn the tables when the label dont react, its Wayniac

Chorus 2x

Jah Skillz-
Too much clout I'm havin so niggas be grabbin at my wealth
At test a math, set them back on the shelf
They say we love your skills, I'm good for your health,,
My lifeline droppin the dime on them like a stealth bomb
Will calm a nigga down with my one round
Suppose they act up, my back up's involved now
GFCs included, my crew is undisputed
Heavyweight champs, known for blowin out yo amps

Trip Locc-
I had patience but now I'm anxious
Lurkin like a cat on the deal with my sack
I know somebody watchin the Locc
Can't stop cuz it just start poppin please
I gots tah have it like Mickey D's
Over 60 billion served rollin on the daily
Can't tell me shit put it in and I won't notice
Me and my niggas nothin but that top notch
Long Beach postin up the road blocks
You can't go through, or around, you gotta turn back
I'm gettin turned back, ridahs and killaz that dont play that
Known to bring it on when it pop, missions to clock
Stages to rock, when I'm done lounge at the spot

Chorus repeats to fade
