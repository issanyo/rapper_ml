[Ronnie DeVoe]
Now check it, I'm taking no losses
Now I'm the boss and I see ya flossin my way
With the grass all up in my face so I say
What's up love how ya doin'
What ya think about me and you scr...
Naw but wait, lets make a date, plans for dinner

Got me fiendin' for the cream don't you know

[Mike Bivins]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby boo

I wanna freak it but first I'm gonna take a peek at it
Grab it, stab it cause you know I got's to have it so

(Chorus)
Hit me off

She's the finest thing I've ever seen
Lookin like a natural queen

[Knee-Hi]
I'm makin huge impacts with every track that I attack
Keepin my eyes open and my hands up on my slack (thats right)
I learned game as an itty bitty kitty from that 5 foot city
(Knee-Hi function with the nitty gritty)
New Edition they came fishin for a honey dip
But now dont trip, I'm only fishin with my money flip (what)
Cuttin it close see the most try to get my number (thats right)
They you wonder where your niggas headin, summer summer
Clownin like a circus still purpose is to bump this
I represent the left side and the west side of your compass
Half of the boys out there lookin lost
What I need is a young man to come hit me off

(Chorus)
Hit me off (ah, baby baby)
Hit me off
(I got my mind on my money yo the booty's on me)
Come on baby you drive me crazy, hit me off
Come on baby

(I got my mind on my money yo the booty's on me)
Do de ows...
(I got my mind on my money yo the booty's on me)
