[Produced by Warren G]

[Verse 1]
For 94, I'm a just glide and swerve
Hop up the streets with my heats so observe
Its me Z the whee Z, the Warren to the G Z
The deuces and the treys as kickin it through E-Z
And the beach and the bottle where I'm found
Fuckin around with the muthafuckin Dogg Pound
Fuck it, Warren's goin wild
The G Funk Era and the muthafuckin G Child
Funk, melody, rhythm, base
He which is I is in the muthafuckin place
So let me get away, come again like this
I can turn into a murderer so please dont diss
Cuz if you do, you know where I'm from
Rat tat tat tat diddy dum diddy dum

[Hook]
And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit
And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit

[Verse 2]
Well let me grab my stick and shift to first
I'm spittin plenty game on my second verse
Well let me switch to second just for the rough ride
L-O-N-G-B-E-A-C-H Eastside
Where the grass is greener, at some times
And I dont do shit but drop funky rhymes
Now I'm in neutral, shifting to third
Cuz what you hear is what you heard, nigga
From the G-Funk, G-Funk, cuz we funk, we funk
And if you step muthafucka you get stomped
Like 1, 2, 3 I'm shiftin to the fo
But you dont hear me doe

[Hook]
And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit
And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit

[Verse 3]
I said humpty dumpty sat on the wall
I guess its time for me to sum it up for all
G Funk, G Child, gangsta groove, locc
Past tense it's the Indo smoke
Choke, off the shit that I'm doin

Cuz its me, the Warren to the G

[Hook]
And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit
And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit

[Outro]
