Cedric Ceballos-

Now I told you once before its the mad punk
Kickin rough stuff, quick dunk
Nigga back the funk up yeah
Give a nigga room yeah
Give a nigga space
Throw your hands in the air, westside's in the place
Word up, I got the formula, I'm mixin up the brew
Take the 40 to the head now what you gonna do
Deuce tre is in effect, like Keith dont Sweat
Dont need to break necks just to gets my respect
I stay smooth, until you try to get on my rough side
(what side) westside, fool try to take mine
Ya start to wonder, I know your name is Stevie
Dont think about it fool, cuz you know you can't see me
23, the number's on the tip of your tongue
I got ends, and you can't have none
So a, slow ya roll deuce tre is in control
Listen pay attention and do what you are told, as I flow

(Chorus) x2
Flow, flow on
Flow on, flow on
(yeah, float on)
Flow, flow on
Flow on, flow on
(yeah, keep floatin)

Tickity tock, dont stop, yeah the clock is still tickin
Ya booty chicken rhymes, mine's a finger lickin
Bloodin, crippin, I hear ya body callin
I caugt it with my bangin cuz my skills are into ballin
(Mary J) ain't the way for me
I gets high off my jumpers and my dunks you see
So when the fans start to scream with the ooh and the ahh
I like the bop bop, bop bop baa
(Its like 3 into the 2 and 2 into the 1)
Big balla 23 and my job ain't done
I get started like the hammer, I finish like Shaquille
When ya think ya heard my best well fool look a here
Look a here no fear, rap crystal clear
Flossin in my chevy with the wind in the air
But its a westside thang, mic size thang
Winnin battles ain't nuthin but a chicken wing
I eat em one by one, good clean fun
No need to bring a gun, come and get some
Of this lovable, hugable, my skills are so incredible
Stay like Jodeci, I dont know its time to go, as I flow

(Chorus) x2
Flow, flow on
Flow on, flow on
(keep floatin)
Flow, flow on
Flow on, flow on
(yeah, straight floatin)

Now a verse 3, I think its time to wrap this thing up
Warren G flex the cut, make it go bumpidy bump
In my speaker, my sneakers go sqeaker, damn
Look at honey over there with the nice smooth features
She's on my nuts, oh no here she comes
(How's about a 68 and I owe you one)
I ain't wit the slippin, trippin, forget about honey dippin
I'm too caught up with my ends to be spittin and drippin
Not Teddy, but I had the 1, 2 checker
(She know you got the money stackin high) yeah I betcha
(Do I know you from somewhere, boy you look familiar)
I'm the Snoop Doggy Dogg in ya life so can I hit ya
Later, cuz its my time to wreck it
Say my praire, rock the crowd, bring home the checkered
Spend a little, save the rest another show again
No complaints from the dog cuz I love them ends
Got some fools tryin to break me off proper like
See me bouncin in my fo yeah I'm hoppin right
No need for the noise, whatcha shoutin about
Check my rear, three wheel motion, peace sign and I'm out

(Chorus) x4 to fade
Flow, flow on
Flow on, flow on
(yeah, float on)
Flow, flow on
Flow on, flow on
(yeah, keep floatin)
