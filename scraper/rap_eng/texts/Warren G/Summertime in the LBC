[Intro: C Knight]
Yeah, This is C Knight from the Dove Shack
Gettin' dojahed out
Kickin' it at King's Park with all the homies
Heh, and you know what I'm sayin'
So why don't you uh, check out my homie Bo to the Roc

[Verse 1: Bo Roc]
I ride with the, I slide with the
Locs and doggs from the LBC
All of the hoes wanna kick it with me
Cause I run with Warren G
Blaze your weed, bustas and G's
Water balloon fighters
Low riders, and East Siders (East Siders)
All come around (Come around)
To hear the Dove Shack G Funk sound
All come around (Come around)
To kick it in my town, yeah

[Hook]
Let me hear you say ooh ahh
Summertime in the LBC
Ooh ahh
Summertime in the LBC

[Verse 2: Arnita Porter]
Now me and my girls are deep
In a '94 Wrangler Jeep
Flossin' all through Long Beach
Daisy Dukes gets props
Hair and nails fresh from the shop
And we are at the bombest spot
Called the shack

[Verse 3: 2 Scoop]
Three months of pleasure
How can I measure the relaxation
All the fun I'm facing
My homies got green, that's them
For sho' though
Hit the sto' do' so I can get a 4-0
My lil' cousin rushin to the park to munch
Standin in line to get a free lunch
Why do we do what we do when we do what we do
Hanging out late with no curfew

[Hook]
Let me hear you say ooh ahh
Summertime in the LBC
Ooh ahh
Summertime in the LBC

[Verse 4: C Knight]
Damn, it's hot than a mutha
I'm smothering ribs with barbecue sauce
Fools get tossed if they reach across my barbecue grill
So continue to chill
At King's Park in the LBC
That's where you'll find me
Hangin' with my homies and my friends
We got the Coke and Henn'
We got Da Five Footaz and the Twinz
We got Warren G and the D-O-G
All come around
To hear the Dove Shack G Funk sound, yeah

[Outro]
Let me hear you say ooh
Let me hear you say ahh
Let me hear you say ooh
Summertime in the LBC
Let me hear you say ooh
Let me hear you say ahh
Let me hear you say ooh
Summertime in the LBC
