[Warren Verse 1:]
Put it together from the start with the homie
Couldn't picture ever having to part with the homie
And even though you're still here in the flesh
It's different on the West
You're voice is truly missed

The missing piece, I'm saying it ain't the same
Never leave you alone praying for one more day
Who'd these niggas come and get their hooks from
When they needed their radio shit spun
Nate Number One

A true artist indeed, you made your own lane
All these albums we drop will never be the same
Without your voice on em
I'm thinkin that's the key
Choked up, smoked out, riding to these melodies
Reminiscing memories
On my way to visit you in therapy
Hoping God make it clear to me
On what the plan is
This dirty game is hella scandalous
So this right here, is dedicated to Nate!

[Hook:]
This is dedicated to you...
It's really something special
Making dreams come true
Seems hard to figure out
What this world is all about
This is dedicated
This is dedicated to you

[Warren Verse 2:]
From the dope spots
To popping on the charts
Grinding in the beach
To make it on the streets
Touring overseas
Submitting legacy
Writing history
With every song you sing

Uh Regulatin the era
Standing side by side, man we down for whatever
Was the days of the past, now I'm looking to the future like
I don't even want to do music

But, I gotta keep it crackin
It's a challenge when your homie's talent hanging in the balance and
Life is such a trip, I know the world is full of madness
Relearning learn how to walk and talk again, I can't imagine
What that rehabilitation is like
When the Doc said that you couldn't sing on the mic
What the hell is going on
He's been writing songs
Hell No that ain't Nate Dogg

[Hook: X3]
This is dedicated to you
Really something special
Making dreams come true
Seems hard to figure out
What this world is all about
This is dedicated to you
You, You, Oh You
