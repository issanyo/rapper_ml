[Verse 1 - Warren G]
Put it together from the start with the homie
Couldn't picture ever having to part with the homie
And even though you're still here in the flesh
It's different on the West, your voice is truly missed
The missing piece, I'm saying it ain't the same
Never leave you alone, praying for one more day
Who these niggas come and get their hooks from
When they need their radio shit spun? Nate number 1!
A true artist indeed, you made your own lane
All these albums we drop will never be the same
Without your voice on them. I'm thinking that's the key
Choked up, smoked out, riding to these melodies
Reminiscing memories, on my way to visit you in therapy
Hoping God make it clear to me on what the plan is
This dirty game is hella-scandalous, so this right here
Is dedicated to Nate

[Hook]
This is dedicated to you
It's really something special
Making dreams come true
Seems hard to figure out
But that's what it's all about
This is dedicated
This is dedicated to you

[Verse 2 - Warren G]
From the dope spots, to popping on the charts
Grinding in the beach to make it on the streets
Touring overseas, submitting legacies
Writing history with every song you sing
Regulating the era, staying side-by-side
And we gamble whatever. was the days of the past
Now I'm looking to the future like
I don't even wanna do music!
But I gotta keep it crackin
It's a challenge when your homie's talent
Hanging in the balance and life is such a trip
I know the world is full of maddness
Learning how to walk and talk again? I can't imagine..
What that rehabilitation is like
When that doc said that you couldn't sing on the mic
What the Hell is going on?
He's been writing songs
Hell no, that ain't Nate Dogg!

[Hook]
This is dedicated to you
It's really something special
Making dreams come true
Seems hard to figure out
But that's what it's all about
This is dedicated
This is dedicated to you
