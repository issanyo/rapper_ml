Hey you gon miss up on the g-funk era
Ya know we said things won for warren g, and soon turned superstar
11-10-7 D that was my intro
And now I'm makin dough, I'm rollin a 64
Well things get shady when the grass is greener
Brothas throwin up sets in hoods like ya neva seen a
Young mac daddy do his thing 'cause I pack right
I got 44 ways to make you act right
And it's a shame how the game must be played
It was told never fold by the brothas you can't fade
So raise up on this young hog
'Cause I heard you punkin some but you can't punk me dogg
I got my own thang 'cause I let my beats swing
It ya wanna bring it bring it on no pain to gain
So as I creep can you peep what I speak
Techniques unique, so what you sayin is obsolete
So there it is as I go about my days
I can only bring it to you like this in so many ways
Hey, hey, hey this is Warren G you know
And I was in Baghdad
Before these lil youngstaz was in they Daddy bag
Ya know, yeah, they in violation Wayniac so hound em
I'm bein true ain't no fakin wit me
Brovas plottin on me trynna test if they can see
But I'm peepin out the sain for the peeps who gimme props
For stayin out that madness you know it ain't gon stop
In so many ways I let 'em know
In so many way I let it flow
But you still don't hear me though
So I'm gon break it down 'cause it's quite elementary
This is for da homies in da penetentary
Ab baby papa
Big rotch from the block
And the homey j dogg down 'cause you'ze a hoe
I got plenty love, and homey love stays
I can only bring it to ya like this, in so many ways
Hey, hey, hey this is Warren G you know
And I was in Baghdad
Before these lil youngstaz was in they Daddy bag
Ya know, yeah, they in violation Wayniac so hound em
I stay true to the game
But some stay blind to the fact
That if I don't look good, you don't look good
So please rearrange and change the things you doin
You playin yourself 'cause you the one gettin screwed
As i, ease on down the rick road
As I shift from first to second, cruise control
So spark up the doujer
'Cause I got the drink, and don't think that
We don't roll without a full tank
Of that bomb that we called the funk
'Cause I am the g and the funk is what you want
Now lets take a trip to the other side of town
Brothas flip flop and they neva stay down
Wanna be all they can be, but gettin held back
Tryin to take what is mine what type of lick is that
So this is for the homies stay down for your pay
I can't only bring it to you like this in so many ways
Hey, hey, hey this is Warren G you know
And I was in Baghdad
Before these lil youngstaz was in they Daddy bag
Ya know, yeah, they in violation Wayniac so hound em
