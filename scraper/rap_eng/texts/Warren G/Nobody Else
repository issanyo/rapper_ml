​Pop it for Destructo
​We don't give a damn bitch

​Make you wanna leave your man
You wanna make me your man

[Verse 2: Warren G]
New Benz with the top off
Red on red call it hot sauce
She don't do it for the top dog
Popping them bottles, yeah pop off
Her boyfriend he a knockoff
Fake rollie, yeah knockoff
I'm on the ground like lockjaw
2Pac, I'm a Outlaw
I want ZZ Top with some PD Rock
I made her bed rock at the G-spot
That was a easy cop, don't call the cops
It's going down, she's screaming hot
She's on top, that's T-O-P
She want me, that's Warren G
G-House and 2-1-3
(She a freak in that Mercedes)
