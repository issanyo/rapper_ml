Been such a long time since I held you
All the while you used to talk to me
All the things you said made me so strong
You know what, I would say I would keep movin' on
Sometimes I sit back and think about how it was
When I was young, I used to think it was you I couldn't live without
Somehow, life took a sad route
Sometimes the wind blows bad enough to take a plane down
Your straight bullets killed children on playgrounds
Bullshit got me about to smoke a whole pound
Meanwhile, I smile, hoping I can rebound
Somehow the LBC streets ain't the same now, without you
Things ain't been the same since you ain't around
But I stay strong game tight, hold it down
Warren G, I never played a blackground
This song is fucked up, because you gone
Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, again and again
Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, again and again
Nothing means more to me, than family
When one lost, it's sad to see, damn it's me
A friend you will always be
Above all things, you taught me to pursue my dreams
With joy it brings, at times when I sit and think
I know inside you smiled down, proud at me
I just need one more drink, damn
At night I can't sleep, I admit that its hard to eat
It's all good, I ain't trippin'
Tried to show me the right laws and guidelines
But I ain't listen, I'm sitting here lavishing and living
And I'd give it all back because you still missing
Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, again and again
Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, again and again
Lord please hear me, ease my soul
I woke up one day and my mom was gone
I'm in the zone wishing I could call your home
Sing your song, tell ya that I'm out on tour
All alone, I just needed to hear your voice on the phone
Mother and son, though I'm grown
Life moves on, I need you Mom, a quiet storm
Differences and right and wrong
As I move on, since Warren G ain't gone
The stitch is on, set the tone, the page I'm on
Is having fun, having a ball, living life
I'm still here, wishing you was home
Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, again and again
I still see you standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, over, over, over
Again, again, I miss you
Ohh Mama, don't know, Mama, don't know
How I keep it strong, keep moving on
Keep it strong, movin' it on
Keepin' it strong, movin' it on
Keepin' it strong, movin' it on
Keepin' it, oh Mama, keepin', oh Mama
The things she told me
I promise I'll be the same to your grand children
What you worded me
Don't worry
I still feel you mama
The things you say
I feel your arms around me everyday
Oh, Mama, oh I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, know, know
I know you're there
Smiling down at me
