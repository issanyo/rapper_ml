(2x)

Ba-da-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-daaa
(That's the type) (Yeah)
(Cuz a Eastside party ain't no joke)
[Warren G]
Smoke, smoke... then Locc
(Cuz a Eastside party ain't no joke)

[Tripp Locc]
The first stop PCH and atlantic, the homefront
Poly apartments where the party still jumps
From dusk to dawn, makin me yawn, cuz I'm out late
Smokin in the cut with the homies, 86 the date
Don't feel like trippin tonight, so I get back
More concerned with my paper, cause now I'm on contract
Wonderin if this meal ticket a guarantee
Me a way out of the Eastside of LB
But you know like I know, ain't no place like home
Gone for a second best believe that I'm back home
24-7 where the love just don't stop
Comedian done tell the homies on the block
Get together, cuz ain't nothin changed but my mood
I might get to tweak and start to trippin on fools
But I chill, I hangs with them niggas that's real
Headed to the Eastside nigga you know the deal

(Chorus)

[Wayniac]
Now as time passes by I sit and wonder where it all went
Days at King Park when free lunch was the lick
Hangin out baggin with the homies on the block
Some workin jobs, others slingin rocks
Blazin up that thai bumpin shit from way back
All my niggas in the cut tryin to keep away from flack
Everybody drinkin so we all gotta stroll
Some drinkin 8-Ball others black and gold
Gotta get my hair cut so you know I gots to peel
Bellin back from PCH on my way to Bobby Neal's
Tighten up my fade make a stop at VIP
I'm on the lookout, the latest hit from DJ Warren G
At night we steppin scandlous tryin to party with the skirts
Wit a glass in your hand, time to put in work
The Eastside steady dippin plenty drama in the name
Wit nine into that nine folk peepin everything

Chorus

I step right out the club to the party by my mama house
It don't close till four and everybody still hangin out
Just-a-laughin, talkin, crackin them jokes
Got the munchies like a mutha we still gonna smoke
Loc I know I can't make it to the nickel tonight (And why is that?)
Chocolate Thai got me through for the night
So carry on cuz I'm gone in the wind my friends
Showin' nothin' but the love for the city I'm in

[Warren G]
If you can groove to this well then smoke
If you can move to this well then Loc
Because ain't no party like an Eastside party
Cuz a Eastside party ain't no joke
(repeat 2X)

Chorus 3X

If you can groove to this well then smoke
If you can move to this well then Locc
Because ain't no party like a Eastside party
Cuz a Eastside party ain't no joke
(repeat 3X)
