[Hook - Nate Dogg]
You got beef then go and run on up
We ain't worried about nothing
Half of y'all doing nothing but bluffing
You got beef then go and run on up
We ain't worried about nothing
Half of y'all doing nothing but talking
Ain't it man?

[Warren G]
I'm strictly street with it, listen to me
They speak it but we did it, they hated on my "Ghetto Village"
But if Stevie can see it, it must mean that I'm real with it
Corporate America gotta deal with it
I'm riding this 'til the finish line
213 still in this 'til they give me mine
Rewind the show and watch the movie
I'm mad as fuck I let this industry use me

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm a low-key OG which is well known
Snoop Alphonse Capone Corleone
In the streets with the elite my rap sheet is hella long
Let it go, naw let it 'lone
You wanna battle when the shadows are creapin'
If you talking about beef then nigga ain't no sleepin'
The hood ain't got no Geneva either
If you run off at the mouth then I'm gonna leave you breathe-less
Breathless, chestless, best list' ya bastard
Looking at my homies like you wanna slide past them and get with me
Need I warn you I'm from Dogg House motherfucking California
Now if you want it like you think you do
We can set up a head up and I bank ya boo
Don't underestimate, a lot of suckers player-hate
They know about the big D-O-double, Warren G and Nate

[Nate Dogg]
Too much talking shit
Let's get down to biz-ness
If you got beef go and run up
I'mma bust him in his lip
I'm gonna shoot through that dude vest
Shut the fuck up and run run up

[Hook]
