Its that nigga Gz WheeZ
Back for the 9-c
I ex sippin on the yak so people wanna know whats next
Ain't nuthin changed, another day a new time
With this uptempo beat with the G-Funk rhyme
Regulatin state to state, coast to coast
Its all about the call of greens, yak, lets toast
Cuz its a ballin society
I try to be the dopest I can be in this industry
But you dont hear me
I think ya betta, I think ya betta
Cuz when I, get it goin on I ain't gonna let up
I set up, the g-funk family and we
Funkin up the industry until eternity
Its alright with you if its alright with me
We'll get down to the sounds of the LBC

Chorus: repeat 2X

Relax your mind, your mind, your mind
Relax your mind and let your conscious be freein you down
To the sounds of the Warren G

It ain't easy bein Gz
But the lifestyle I chose, the status to which I rose
The doors, I open, I'm loccin, I'm scopin
Through the eyes of the G Child
I see many try to duplicate the LBC style
But it ain't even happenin like that
I was time I had to make a comeback
And get mine, you know I'm genuine
Been in motion with the potion with Snoop since 89
Devotion is the key for me so
Relax your mind and let your conscious be free
The homey just touched down, foolin wit a pound
Put yo gun down, so you can walk a safe ground

Chorus: repeat 2X

I know it's been hard on you for about two, so
I had to relax your mind, I thought you knew
Ain't nothin but a Long Beach party
With yo hands in the air, with the twist of Coke and Bacardi
All the homeys around and the slingshot t-shirts
Skirts wit the baby fat it'll work
Pass me the indosmoke and get locced
From the beach to the bay, makin them sway
Like the ocean in motion, we coastin
Relax your mind and keep floatin (floatin, floatin, floatin)
And walk a safe ground

Chorus: repeat 6X
