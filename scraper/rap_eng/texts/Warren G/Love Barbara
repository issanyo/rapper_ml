[Intro]
Did I tell you I love Barbara?
Everytime I hit her she make me a lil harder
Everytime I hop on we take it a lil farther
Sometimes I wanna leave her, but I can't why bother?

[Verse 1]
She keep me gassed like X on, hit her in the early morning
Times with the vest on
Got me looking a lil better now
Got me feeling a lil better now
If I don't touch her imma let her down
Barbara's the best girl, let the world spread around
Cuz you can let your friends hit her (yeah)
And let her all of your mens hit her (yeah)
And even let the girls hit her
Barbara don't care she'll let the whole world hit her
So if you wanna get harder, rob at the ghost
We need to go and touch Barbara

[Chorus]
Did I tell you I love Barbara
In the parks they love Barbara
In the gyms they love Barbara
"We need a drink, Bartender" everybody loves Barbara
Did I tell you I love Barbara
In the streets they love Barbara
In the jails they love Barbara
"We need a drink, Bartender" everybody loves Barbara

[Verse 2]
Barbara got me like a junky, met her in kindergarten
Used to call her a monkey, lost touch then met again in the pen
She a real good friend, strong make her a man
Used the keep her in the doorway, no gloves hit her the raw way
Hangin was the foreplay, stamina's up I'm up to hit it all day
Cuz she love when I'm trickin' on her, and I don't get mad
When them other brothers is hittin' on her
Is she busy then I'm dippin' on her
I push up real hard, lay to make it sure I'm flippin' on her
I look small and I'm slippin' on her
I get bigger three months doe, ninety days grippin' on her
She been down for a long time, only girl in the world never
That it's the wrong time, look in the park and I bet you
She got a long line

[Chorus]
Did I tell you I love Barbara
In the parks they love Barbara
In the gyms they love Barbara
"We need a drink, Bartender" everybody loves Barbara
Did I tell you I love Barbara
In the streets they love Barbara
In the jails they love Barbara
"We need a drink, Bartender" everybody loves Barbara

[Verse 3]
She be in the park, in the gym, in the jails too
Willin to get it in, for anyone who cares too
You gotta love Barbara, and if you goin hard
I suggest you go harder! Brothers is coming through
Tryna Bogard her, to get more cut up, or get more larger
Here's a word to our sponsor, Barbara, Barbarian style I hit you like a monster

[Chorus]
Did I tell you I love Barbara
In the parks they love Barbara
In the gyms they love Barbara
"We need a drink, Bartender" everybody loves Barbara

In the jails they love Barbara
"We need a drink, Bartender" everybody loves Barbara
