[Intro: Gil Scott-Heron]
The blues has always been totally American
As American as apple pie
As American as the blues
As American as apple pie
The question is why
Why should the blues be so at home here?
Well, America provided the atmosphere

[Verse 1]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
I take a look over my shoulder, as I get older
Getting tired of mothafuckas saying, "Warren I told ya"
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
With these funny-bunny niggas, ain't shit changing
Got my Mama wondering if I'm gang banging
But I don't pay attention to these father figures
I just handle mine, and I'm rolling with my niggas
Off to the VIP, you see Snoop Dogg and Warren G
Unbelievable how time just flies
Right before your eyes, but you don't recognize
Now who's the real victim, can you answer that
The nigga that's jacking or the fool getting jacked?

[Refrain]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

[Verse 2]
Another sunny day, another bright blue sky
Another day, another muthafucka die
These are the things I went through when I was growing up
There's only one hood, and niggas shit be throwing up
And I knew it, there really ain't nothing to it
Thinking every fool's gotta go through it
Now let's go back, how far, back in time
Dragging to these hookas trying to mack for mine
I remember when we all used to stop at the spot
Back then my nigga-name was Snoop Rock
It was all so clear, '87, '88, then '89s the year
You say everywhere we roll, you can say we roll thick
Way back then 2-1-3 was the clique
Something to stay paid I was just a young hog
Warren G, Snoop Rock and Nate Dogg

[Refrain]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

[Verse 3]
You make me wanna holla, get out the game
Too many muthafuckas know my name
While Snoop Dogg's serving time up in Wayside
I puts it down on the street, don't try to take mine
I had to reassure the homie that he wasn't alone
We'd talk, and him and Nate'd conversate on the phone
He kept saying, "Nigga, it won't be long
Before a little skinny nigga like me'll be home"
I said "Snoop, things done changed, it's not the same
We need to get up out the game
Cause we can get paid in a different way
With you kicking dope rhymes and I DJ"
Well as time goes past, slowly we try to make it
But things are getting hectic, I just can't take it
Should I, A: Go back to slanging dope
Or should I, B: Maintain and try to cope
Or should I, C: Just get crazy and wild
But no, I chose D: Create the G-Child
It's been on ever since with me and Mista Grimm
This shit is getting so hectic that I can't even trust him now
What would you do for a Warren G cut
Would you act the fool and nut the fuck up
Back the fuck up, act the fuck up
Niggas talk shit they get smacked the fuck up, straight up

[Refrain]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
