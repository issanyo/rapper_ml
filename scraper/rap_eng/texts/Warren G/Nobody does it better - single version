Nobody does it better, nobody does it better
They can come closer than close, yeah
Original they never will be
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah, yeah
We just tryin' make you see, nobody does it better
I'm sittin' here trippin', my mind is blocked
Nate Dogg just spit it so it's time to cock
No one can do it better like this 2 man crew
They say we're one hit it quitters, now what cha'll gonna do?
Always into somethin', that's my name
Only out for money, hey 'cause that's the game
People always ask me why I'm out for scratch
He who has the most is he who won the match
Strike one, me and Nate Dogg is a match
Strike two, leave 'em standing still in their tracks
Strike three, you can call us 2-1-3
It's the L and the B that makes me act like a G
My exhibition started back in '93
No one, nobody listenin' but Warren and me
To all the nonbelievers, now I bet you see
Nobody does it better than me
They can come closer than close, yeah
Original they never will be
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah, yeah
We just tryin' make you see, nobody does it better
They call me DJ, the spark plug, keepin' it licked
There is no accident for these platinum hits
So when we make it to show love, bangin' in your club
Hangin' with your thugs, givin' up G love
Do you remember back on the East Side?
When all of us niggas used to love to ride
We didn't care what we did
Time was nothing to us, we were just kids
Times are different now but you still get stuck
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck
So if you think you really wanna step to me
Keep this is mind, nobody does it better than me
They can come closer than close, yeah
Original they never will be
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah, yeah
We just tryin' make you see, nobody does it better
Wow, make you say go now
Hot rap singles on the charts now
Got a baby, so I'm breakin' hearts now
On your mark, get set, it starts now
All you pimp playin' hustlers, now you know
You can't keep me out once you crack the door
Either join a team or it's best you flee
Nobody does it better than me
They can come closer than close, yeah
Original they never will be
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah, yeah
We just tryin' make you see, nobody does it better
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it better
