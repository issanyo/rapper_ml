[Lil' Flip]
Heh, yeah this time around you gotta feel me
Cause I got my mind right
And now I got my money right

[Chorus: Flip + Redd]
I got my mind on my money, money on my mind
(Maaan Flip what you doin?), I'm grinding!
I got my mind on my money, money on my mind
My watch ain't tickin it's winding!
I got my mind on my money, money on my mind
I'm standin on the cut(*sirens)nigga fuck!
I got my mind on my money, money on my mind
Watchin out for feds in them undercover trucks

[Lil' Flip]
Like 2Pac I got the Juice
Write another book like Dr. Seuss
Sittin sideways and my choppas blue
Southside roll on choppas smooth
I'm doin this for Dj Screw (Screw)and I gotta make that cash
And I hate that slow money cause I gotta make it fast
Man I gotta make it last cause I'm a hust-a-la
A syrup sippin, bird flippin, money dou-b-ler
So holla at me if you niggas wanna re-up
I'm like the head coach I gotta keep my D up
My jewerly freezed up, mybad it's froze up
I'm pullin up in a Lam' with the do's up
So get ya cash right don't get a bad wife
Make sure she ain't that chick I hit last night

[Chorus: Flip + Redd]
I got my mind on my money, money on my mind
(Maaan Flip what you doin?), I'm grinding!
I got my mind on my money, money on my mind
My watch ain't tickin it's winding!
I got my mind on my money, money on my mind
I'm standin on the cut(*sirens)nigga fuck!
I got my mind on my money, money on my mind
Watchin out for feds in them undercover trucks

[Lil' Flip]
I'm spectacular bite ya neck like Dracula
Flippin in my Acura you know I'm still a bachelor
We smokin on turantula with a fine ass hoe named Tamera
With a cousin named Angela who pose for my camera
I'm young but I got stamina and I'll wreck you're hoe
And just like Nike nigga I'll check you're hoe
So let's make this dough and get the hell out the game
Cause after this shit I ain't slangin no more caine(whaaaat!)

[Chorus: Flip + Redd]
I got my mind on my money, money on my mind
(Maaan Flip what you doin?), I'm grinding!
I got my mind on my money, money on my mind
My watch ain't tickin it's winding!
I got my mind on my money, money on my mind
I'm standin on the cut(*sirens)nigga fuck!
I got my mind on my money, money on my mind
Watchin out for feds in them undercover trucks

[Lil' Flip]
Yeah all I'm doin is just representin for the hustlers
You know my niggas in Little Rock Knahimsayin they gettin they paper
My niggas in Kansas they gettin they paper
Knahimsayin my niggas in Chicago gettin they paper
My niggas in Louieville gettin they mothafuckin money

Ya Knahimsayin if you a hater you gotta kill me
