[DJ EZ Dick]
Hey this is radio station Shake That Ass
And I wanna see that ass shakin
Toppin the charts today we got a world a premiere from DJ Warren G
Hey DJ

[Mr Malik]
I never crash and wreck
Yeah best I smash on that
Wit my apparatus in these sacks
We bring the cash in these checks
Gz its easy can you feel me
I thought you needs for she Z
They never kill me, but at will see
I grip the illy with the really
And MCs could never twist me unless I was in their Phillys
Come on really, I turn silly on billys
To big willys like Tommy Willis
Understand the last man standin like Bruce Willis

(Chorus)
Hey DJ lets play that song keep me dancin all night
Hey DJ lets play that song keep me dancin all night

[Warren G]
Don't let it end till you let it begin
We want yo hands in the air cuz we back again
With Hershey L-O double C doe, funk by the kilo
And we know, how to keep it on the G Low
Incognito, from the Beach to Puerto Rico
I rolls the dice and my nigga plays C-Low
Warren G doe, search the lethal like chico
And nowadays with the Ways like Carlito
Funk to Kito, my weapons too lethal
I'm checkin on my Mic there's no equal to my sequel
Okay party people to the people the people the people the people in the place

(Chorus)
Hey DJ lets play that song keep me dancin all night
Hey DJ lets play that song keep me dancin all night

[Mr Malik]
From night to day, day to night it stay on
We holla Hey DJ now won't you play that song
Like Teddy oh nah he ain't dead
We gots tah gots tah wake everybody sleepin in bed
Cuz if you sleep, you slippin, you creep you creppin
As we sweep you get swept if you ask whats next
You know how my coke in my hindu, you at the venue
To be continued, you know we first up on this menu

(Chorus)
Hey DJ lets play that song keep me dancin all night
Hey DJ lets play that song keep me dancin all night

[Warren G]
Now as my pen, begin to let loose again
The bullets like duck, duck, goose, stuck
In the middle of a frame, buck, wit a little bit a game, stuck
And its a muthafuckin shame
But I'm still here to maintain and run thangs
As the day gets clearer, I'm lookin in my rear view mirror
And I hear a, nigga that I used be down with
A nigga that I used to clown with
And get around with, fuck the pound shit
They dont make niggas like they used to
I remember Marley in the Juice Crew
Thats why I stay down with LBC days
It ain't easy
Okay party people to the people the people the people the people and the playaz

Chorus: repeat 3X

Hey DJ lets play that song keep me dancin all night
Hey DJ lets play that song keep me dancin all night
