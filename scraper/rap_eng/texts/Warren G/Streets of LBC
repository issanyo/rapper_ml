I saw paper dancing in the streets
In the streets of a Long Beach City
Listen to the beat
My people stroke their feet on the funky concrete streets of...
Streets of a Long Beach City

Some niggas quick to get it confused
This is where it's cracking at (wassup my man?)
Big city of music, we more than half of that
What happens after midnight goes unspoke of
Cause broke niggas where I'm at, they don't show love
And I done witnessed the concrete junglin
Watch the nigga turn soft and leave humblin
Since I was young, I hung out, hard knock
Played my hand when they dealt my cards
Now check it out, what's real is what's happenin
Now this is what I deal with and where I live at
Not too many of us make it
To see the day that we able to make a statement
The ways of the world has gone crazy
Two things never change
That's the music and what the rules of the game is
Now everybody knows yo name
It ain't no other place to turn
But I yearn to get a hold on this street shit, I learnt it

Take it back when I ain't had much
A little bad nigga scrappin over bad much (gimme that fool)
But I was born with a hunch for this shit
My nigga did beats, still I hustled a bit
Helpin my mother's ends meet
It's hard, is God watchin?
Non stop while the cops keep rollin by on my block
I see paper dancin in the streets
So what's the chance I can make the money work for me?
But it hurts to see ya niggas doin dirt
For a livin so I put in work with this gift I was given
Now might I mention I been blessed by God
And I'm down with anything to make life less hard
No matter where you are, it can happen to anybody
That's how it was where I came up and now I talk about it
LBC, city of music
G-funk you tell me, we do's it

Is you forgettin 213? (Warren, Snoop and Nate)
You must be trippin and forgot that it was me nigga
Well check it out, you remember DRE
If you ain't know, well listen here, that nigga's kin of me
And I don't know, but maybe you can sense this
Snoop and Nate, them niggas I been friends with
And I'm a frontline soldier to the fullest (fullest)
My punchline burns hotter than bullets (bullets)
But the way I play this game
Displays too many ways to get paid
Now I ain't trippin of shit, not one of ya'll say (I ain't trippin)
Cause ain't nothin like the spot I'm from, and not
Too many niggas walk the block I'm from, it's 2-1
