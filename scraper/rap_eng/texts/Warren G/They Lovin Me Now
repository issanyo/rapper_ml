[Warren G]
Ooooo weee
See y'all lost confidence
Talkin with that nonsense keepin comets
This is compliments
From me to the industry
The ?locest? G when you see one
When them G's come from where I'm from it's unspoken
Doggin' and locin', squabbin', jaw broken
We ain't hopin', we wish to tear this bitch
I ain't scared of shit I'm swift with the Smiff
And that motherfuckin Wessun
Droppin dope on fools with no questions
And thats a fact when I bust you ho's guessin'
True confessions
And many lessons get dealt with
From coast to coast and loc to loc
I won't go broke and smoke that smoke
That you choke *echoes*

[Bridge] *caughin'*
Is he allright?
Is he allright?
Is he allright?

[Hook: Butch Cassidy]
They lovin me now
I get my way now, make 'em say "hey now"
Look and brake my pay down
Or I make my move on you
No other you foul
Can mess with my sound, ???? up in your town
Laughin as we smike ponds
Ain't no stoppin me 'til I ?????

[Boss Hogg]
Y'all don't wanna see the great game
With the way down
Bitch y'all take a change in the gate now
One: ?Dear Sabrine?
Came right back
Where the fuckin monster on the team, like that
Our way ???? our ???? back boy
?????, ?????, E-dub and fat boy
The realest, fuck the McCoy
Go get us
Why the fuck you think the gangsters in the game roll with us
Long as ??? ritches when I ain't backslapin'
Checkin this bitches, that include bitch niggas too
Let me holla after slugin you
Suck dick, show dollar motherfucker you
Start speakin on me wrong
If you mouth gotta move
Bitch I got the perfect thing to put your mouth on
My own like it should
Don't worry about what Boss do
Obviously doin good

[Warren G]
Now it's a tip how they treat us Boss
But I ain't trippin it's a trip how we beat 'em Boss
And now we dippin'
64, Lac's, Bently's on D's
Hittin hood's and blocks climbin in the ??????
Industry suckers and fake companies
All Y'all can eat on this
For not believein' in me, for trippin on me
You better check them stats while you hayin on me
I'ma 10 year motherfuckin vet'
From 2pac to Snoop and Dre I get my respect
Warren G, the Long Beach imperial

You see me comin in a crowd and smoke
?So baby why you take the toke?
Why you hang with loc's

Mess with my money and it's time to kill
Cause I'm out to make a mill
