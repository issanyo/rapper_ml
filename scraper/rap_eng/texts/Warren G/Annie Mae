Warren G-
1, 2 buckle my shoe
3, 4 we gotta hit the store
5, 6 back in the mix
7, 8 Warren G and Nate

Nate Dogg-
Bang to the boogy say up jump the boogy
To the rhythm of the boogidy beat
I dont love no hoes they know so they don't be fuckin wit me

Warren G-
A long time ago I met Annie Mae
She was killing me softly like everyday
Penetentiary steel, was stickin for real
Blockbustin through the walls
Now I'm makin housecalls

Nate Dogg-
I thought I'd met a lot of scandalous women, and then I met Annie Mae
Got a thin big butt like steel
But she didn't have a place to stay

Warren G-
She was shackin at mine and shackin at his
Blowin my socks, tellin his biz
Nate Dogg this and Nate Dogg that
213 skirt, and we stay intact
So I told the homey Nate don't be mislead
Ain't no fun if the homey can't shake a leg
So I went to the house and knocked on the door
And guess who it was, Annie Mae you H-O

(Chorus)
I once knew a trick named Annie Mae (Annie Mae)
(I once met a bitch named Annie Mae)
I once knew a trick named Annie Mae (Annie Mae)
I once knew a trick named Annie Mae

Nate Dogg-
Remember yesterday I asked you baby have I seen you somewhere before
With just one look, the pussy was took
Cuz I make music that you adore
Now I'm not sure and I might be trippin
But in 94 I heard a song
It ain't no fun unless the homeys can come
So Warren G put a condom on

Warren G-
Now Nate you know me and I know you
I got rubbers, gin and socco(?) too
So lets do the do, on how we do
Never my boot, just a freak that I knew

Chorus

Warren G-
Annie Mae, Annie Mae, you ran out of time
Warren G and Nate Dogg blew your mind
Cuz if you trickin wit him
You trickin wit me, you trickin wit the 2 1 muthafuckin 3
I came from rags to riches
Trustin no snitches
Thats how we do on 9 C I X bitches
Buck em, fuck em, and put em in the trash
And jump in the 600 Benz and dash

Nate Dogg-
Hold up Warren before you go just a couple things I got to say
Are you goin home, I wanna be alone
You need to take this... home

Chorus x3
