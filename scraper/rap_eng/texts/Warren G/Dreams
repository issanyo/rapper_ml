Dreams
Close your [?]
Make me leave
The day that came
Now i can see
I say my prayer
Take my lean
Thought me love and what it seems

[Verse 1:]
Dream chasin’ like Meek Mill
But nightmares feel bad like a cheap thrill
0,7 man, I sign me a sweet deal
Over 6 figures that’s a deep deal
But i ain’t have support system
Like a meat meal, And local radio stop playin’ me
[?]
Five years later niggas talking in the street still
Daughter just turned 4
I’m walking up a steep hill
Momma died on me, Can’t sleep still
Nerves all bad ADD can’t keep still
Anxiety, My soul need a refill
Niggas tryin’ me [?]
Need first to be still
Niggas need to grow up they be catch like g fill
Surrounded bodies fakes hard to be real
Thinking in my mind mind like
Damn is this thing real

[Verse 2]
[?]
Can’t sleep asking God where my mommy at
Dreams differ ’cause my dreams are blur
When i dream i seem i only dream of her
And i often drift when i drive
If it wasn’t for my daughter i commit suicide
No lie through the eyes of my eyes
See the eyes of the wise
Wasn’t enough to know know Jesus
Man falling from the sky
So what’s God to a non-believer
Still dreamin’ one day like Jeisha and Keisha
[?]
I need me a feature
Scare to sleep ’cause when i sleep i be seein’ the reaper
Lord help me if you see me
You see that i need you
Shenanigans
Like a nigga but damn [?]
Now it’s fucking with my brain
All this shit seems strange
Is this a (dream)

[Verse 3:]
I wish it was all a dream
The harsh reality a million murder scene
I wish it was all a dream
[?]
25 to life, I guess it was in his genes
Murder weapon fail i guess it was in his jeans
Through religion no guess my guess them what is genes
Word
But then again it could just be a blur
But then again it could just be a curse
You never know what you never ask
Just like you never miss what you never had
Hard to be a father if there was never a dad
Never know what a good son was if it was never bad
You understand these things?
Cause man it could all just be a (dream)
