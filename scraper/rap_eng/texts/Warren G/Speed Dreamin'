[Hook: George Clinton]
Speed Dreamin'
Snoozin' in the fast lane
Speed Dreamin'
Now I'm in overdrive
Speed Dreamin'
Nappin' in cruise control
Trying to get back to where I should have been by now
Cadillacs stand in the tree line
I'm making them be like
Swerving to the curb
Tires squealing, rubber peeling
Pull up to a halt
But then we're thinking someone ought
[To talk in line the freeway of the mind?]

[Warren G]
I got funk for all yall from me to the bid dogs
Get your asses up pass the blunt
Smoke som', after this go and poke som'
[Mista Grimm]
Um, excuse me Warren I got something about substance abuse
Roll a half ounce up jump in my shit
Hit a switch watch it bounce up (GOOD GRIEF)
Meet me in the Elco with gold leaf (WHO)
Grimm big pimpin' like Filmore Slim
[Warren G]
Tilted brim Mista Grimm rollin' shotgun hop one
Drop one, nigga hit 'em with the Bop Gun
[Mista Grimm]
Yeah I got the chronic its ferocious
You can feel it in your bones like osteoporosis
West coast shit, Im grabbin my gonads
And slangin' gangsta vocabs straight of the notepad
[Warren G]
Aft the dope sack quote that gangsta funk
Warren G, what y'all thought?
Bringing the funk

[Hook (1/2)]

[Mista Grimm]
You listening to G rhymes and I'm here to drop lines
I got that funky fly shit that you wanna hear all the time
All in your system like menthol, yes y'all
Just remove cd from package then install
In your stereo here you go
New material grand imperial
Eat your Mista Grimm cereal
Hit the floor whats rough rugged, twenty four karat nugget like the microphones I carry in my Gucci luggage
I'm Thuggish Ruggish
To the bone marrow and soak in linen apparel talkin the double barrel
Black super hero rhymin'
Rappin sittin busting like its nothing still puffin' coughin chokin
Wild up in the fan's in Oakland floatin
Swerving, taking the dirty version between Persians
Sippin burbon brand new Excursion
Message: Salt kills snails (Saaaaalt)
Nah playas its that West Covina rhyme sayer, yeah

[Hook (order of lyrics switches)]

[Warren G]
Mista G.R.I.M.M. we done dropped one
With my Uncle George we done lock one
Atomic Dog, Knee Deep, in the fast lane
[Mista Grimm]
With the 454 engine block burnin' rubber for a block
Psycho like a Hictchcock flick
Trick, sinister thoughts streamin' while let'n out shots adrenaline pumpin'
G Dub say somethin'
[Warren G]
Supercalifragilocus you could quote this off that purple
You can blow this
Light up pass it around
We make the world go round like the G Funk sound
[Mista Grimm]
I keep the pedal to the medal
Speed dreamin', slidin', dip n glidin'
Chocolate Thai high
Come on, jump in, let's ride, hop in the Mothership
And dip with Mista Grimm and Warren G
We got that shiznit

[Hook (1/2)]

[George Clinton]
Heres to that someone who can't take the pressure
Mercy for that poor fool who made the news
Who feel pissed on that insist on killing all men
Can't take the sorrow of the horrors of his abuse
It ain't worth the sorrows to cause the death ......all men
He's a disgrace to the species in to his face with some feces
Big nose mothafucka got it comin'
How many licks does it take to get to the center of a sucker?
How late do you have to be before you get absent?
Warren G with the P you beta step aside, I'll stick my foot so far up in your ass
The water his knee will rise above your head and drown before you get your ass kickin'
Stop stepin' in footsteps hard to keep up with
Warren G stepin' hard but it ain't as hard as it gon' get
