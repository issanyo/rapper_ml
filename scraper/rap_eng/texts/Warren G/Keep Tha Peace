[Verse 1: KAM & (Warren G)]
Fool, what that Compton like? (It's like Watts)
What was you expectin'? We both checkin' knots
Buckin' shots, the Eastside's no joke
So take a breather if you neither a G or a loc
And you can catch me in traffic
Dippin' on gold ones under short skirts like a Catholic
But some of y'all need to grow up
Set-trippin' when I pass by sayin' (What them niggas throw up?)
When they know where I'm from, I confuse 'em
Don't play dumb, remember, um (He a Muslim)
Every day so I say 'don't get it twisted'
I'm talkin' bout your cap, ol' chap, if you missed it
But we only want peace
The real question is: who down to make war with this beast?
Now which side should I ride on?
Don't blast, give your brother a pass, say 'A'ight, go on'
But be careful who ya hit up
Tryna get a rep but get that young ass lit up
So get up and stand up for this Black thang
And y'all brothers who gangbang, try to keep tha peace

[Chorus 2X]
[Snoop "Doggy Dogg World"] So put yo' gun away, run away, 'cause I'm back (why)
Hit'em up, get'em up, spit'em up (now)
[KAM] Stop the killing in the West and the East
[KAM "Peace Treaty"] For the sake of all the homies that's resting in peace!
[Snoop "Doggy Dogg World"] So put yo' gun away, run away, 'cause I'm back (why)
Hit'em up, get'em up, spit'em up (now)
[KAM] Stop the killing from the West to the East
[KAM "Peace Treaty"] For the sake of all the homies that's resting in peace!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know you wanna be a hog
And love doin' dirt just you and your road dog
On a hooride you glide, throwin' up ya sign
This is Eastside BGs dumpin' with the nine
On ya own kind for a strike, but let 'em be white
Then you pass by the ass wipe
Last night one time came thru the hood bustin'
Five-O is the ones I ain't trustin'
Us in the ghetto got it bad already
But always wanna go to war over somethin' petty
Steady puttin' work in on another Asiatic
A semi-automatic, causin' crazy static
Among brothers of the same flesh and bone
Just say the wrong word and it's on
A family feud, but this ain't no game show
We just both got tricked by the same hoe
Oh, but now you ain't down for no mission
On a crooked cop or a prejudice politician
Who you know can't stand yo' guts
So stay home 'til you grow some nuts
And just keep tha peace

CHORUS

[Verse 3]
Now they say it's on with the es√©s, right
But I know Chicano pride
So let's raise better days in jail so I'm quiet
Tryin' not to get stuck in a race riot
I can't buy it when I hear "That's the enemy!"
'Cause I'm knowin' down deep they're some kin to me
Still I gots to defend mine
Between love and hate it's a thin line
So I take it wit' a grain of salt
'Cause I'm really not knowin' who to blame or fault
For this tension I mention the skunk
Got crews cave-y, the blue-eyed punk
Playin' both sides against each other
Now that's the real mutha...
You gotta join on to your own, the question is can we
Keep it all in the family
Stop lettin' outside people in your circle
And take away everything that you worked for
Show love to yourself if you're willing
To stop the killer, we could stop the killing
And you can keep the peace

CHORUS 2X

"I know you got little guns...
That little foolish thing you got in your pocket you need to be ashamed
But I'm saying to you that with all your weapons, you're only hurting yourself
And our young people are dying in the streets of America
By the hundreds and by the thousands
And it ain't white people killing us
It's us killing one another"
