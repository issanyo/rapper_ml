Call me Dub-A-Double-R-E
N be the end last letter be the G
G be for Griffin, smithin, like Wesson
Niggas, that be 'fessin
I'm crushin your whole chest and
In combat if they fat I'll skinny em
Six times the terror pass the Era to Millineum
G-Funk, bumpin in ya trunk
Call me booshe nigga, LBC me nigga

[RBX]
Straight from Long Beach
Where, we gets more naughtier than ComÄƒneci
Can you say roundoff hand spring
Do ya triple somersault fools will be flipped I'm sure
Long Beach, right by the water
Respect is due when you walk through the border
Line, if you dont you might find your face in a gutter
Long Beach will get ya wets

[Kurupt]
The homey just whistled, gave us the signal
To act the fool with the pistols, pierce the gristle
One way out homey, in the cut
Heat cocked, beef for weeks, heat for block
Techniques to rock, the blocks socks
Unorthodox, cannon cocking bandit nigga
I daily rock the planet nigga
Scope out the vicinity, start seperatin(what?)
Those thats cool and those hatin
Every nigga in between
Got 5 seconds to evacuate the scene (yeah)
Hit the stash (nigga)
Nigga what the fuck you wanna do
Talk, blast, nigga think fast, fast fast

(Chorus x2 - Nate Dogg)
Hit a nigga wit a little gangsta love
Gangsta love
Hit a nigga wit a little gangsta love
Gangsta love

[Warren G]
Lets go to war, no, not with guns
Blast you with heat, original beats they run
Fast and faster, Master like P
Or you can just say, Master Warren G
I'm bout it bout it, highly touted
And I doubt it
If I let another nigga take my tracks and re re-route it
I truck more styles, like my Yukon I puke on
The rest of these niggas, trying to contest

[RBX]
Hold up, who's speaking of contest, no, none of that
We get gats beats technique rat tat tat tat
Splat, and ya flat, pure satisfac
X marks the spot of the brutal venacular
You drinks down like dracula
Listen here buddy you'll be found left bloody
Its the beach nigga, straight up
Before ya hate, get ya weight up
Or get wet up now what up

[Kurupt]
Yeah, yeah OGs
My nigga Warren G, uh huh
Thats my OG
My nigga Nate Dogg, my nigga Snoopy, my nigga RBX
They're my OGs, my real OGs

You up against the aces nigga
It all takes place in many places nigga
Several different faces nigga
The streets can watch me nigga
But the streets is up against Kurupt Momar Khadafi nigga
OG, juggernaut, jagged edge, homey two to the head
As the sprinkle spread
Death will kiss ya, fuck around with the Militia
Stalking till the big homey Nate walked in

[Nate Dogg]
Same old niggas in the same old place
Long Beach city is where I was raised
I keep my heater right by my side
Won't stop mashin till I get my prize
Even if you blind we can make you see
The perfect combination Nate and Warren G
When we bust we hit em everytime
Ain't no secret its about that time
To

(Chorus x2 - Nate Dogg)
Hit a nigga wit a little gangsta love
Gangsta love
Hit a nigga wit a little gangsta love
Gangsta love

Gangsta love
Gangsta love
