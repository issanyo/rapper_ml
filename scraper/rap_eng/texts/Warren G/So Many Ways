[Intro: Lady Levi]
Hey, nah ya goin miss up on the G-Funk era
Ya know we said things won for Warren G, him soon turned superstar

[Verse 1: Warren G]
11-10-70 that was my intro
But now in 94, I'm rollin a 64
Cuz things get shady where the grass is greener
Niggas throwin up sets in hoods like they neva seen a
Young mack daddy do his thing cuz I pack right
I got 44 ways to make you act right
And its a shame how the game must be played
It was told never fold by the niggas you can't fade
So raise up off this young hog
Cuz I heard you punkin some but you can't punk me dog
I got my own thang cuz I let my nuts hang
If you wanna bring it, bring it on no pain no gain
So as I creep can you peep what I speak
Techniques unique, so what you sayin is obsolete
So there it is as I go about my days
I can only bring it to you like this in so many ways

[Chorus: Lady Levi]
Some homies are bad minded
Cannot take them for no friend
I’m sure they’re illegal (in so many ways)
Sure they’re illegal (in so many ways)
Cause I borrow, then they’ll borrow but I lend them a violin
I’m sure they’re illegal (in so many ways)
Sure they’re illegal (in so many ways)

[Interlude: Warren G]
Hey, hey, hey this is Warren G you know
And I was in Baghdad
Before these lil youngstaz was in they Daddy bag
Ya know, yeah, they in violation Wayniac so hound em

[Verse 2: Wayniac]
Its all plain and simple
I roll just to serve a lifetime wit my niggas
Idiotic fools can't figure
The way I display or should I say more than that
Its crucial when I name how many niggas got my back
Neva lack, the skills when its time to handle mine
You can't front if you wanna but you still know the time
I'm, the nigga that they call Wayniac (what that mean)
I'm the nigga stayin down for the home team
So if you didn't know let me slow ya roll
This pro is on the go with some shit you ain't heard before
So recognize game in your face
A touch of the bass then I'm gone without a trace

[Chorus]
People Warren G rhyme wit are gone put you on front lines
And sure day illegal (in so many ways)
And sure day illegal (in so many ways)
Cause me kofi drop the dime for officer not serve the time
And sure day illegal (in so many ways)
And sure day illegal (in so many ways)

[Verse 3: Warren G]
I stay true to the game
But some stay blind to the fact
That if I don't look good, you dont look good
So please rearrange and change the shit you doin
You fuckin yourself cuz you the one gettin screwed
As I, ease on down the brick road
As I shift from first to second, cruise control
So blaze up the buddha
Cuz I got drink, and dont think
We dont roll without a full tank
Of that bomb ass shit called the funk
Cuz I am the G and the funk is what you want
Now, lets take a trip to the other side of town
Niggas flip flop and they never stay down
Wanna be all they can be, but gettin held back
Tryin to take what is mine, (what) what type of shit is that?
So, this is for the homies stay down for your pay
I can only bring it to you like this in so many ways

[Chorus]
Some homies are bad minded, cannot take them for no friend
I’m sure they’re illegal (in so many ways)
Sure they’re illegal (in so many ways)
Cause I borrow, then they’ll borrow but I lend them a violin
I’m sure they’re illegal (in so many ways)
Sure they’re illegal (in so many ways)
