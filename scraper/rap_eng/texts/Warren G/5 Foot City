(I need a freak)
Freak... I need a freak
(I need a freak)

Scope the fro from the door, baby was the bomb
Gotta maintain so I remain calm
With everything I see from a twisted position
Call it female intuition, I know
Seductive and sensual, I'm into yo
Calm male complexion, headin fo the midsection
My legal got ya flexin but chill
Excitement got ya freakin to the skill
I comes to the ill seduction when I be bustin (ya fall deep)
Under the influence of my speech
You taste my flavor, lyrical lifesaver
Love what I gave ya, cannot really save ya
So adjust to this mood
I'm comin freaky freaky freaky for this interlude
Got ya pumped up off the body
I just came to party, oh you brothers are so naughty

Chorus:
If you wanna roll with me
Here's what you can do for me
5 foot city goin on
Freak it till your cherry's gone
You can taste me day or night
I know I can work you right
5 foot city can't you see
I can't help the freak in me

You can call me pappy
Or you can call me daddy
64 hundred spokes, three wheels and I'm happy
Feelin like scrappy or is it Scooby-Doo
Spit one spit two, I got flowers true
So pass that ziff to this brother G Z Whee Z
So I can let you down easy
Some broads try to see what I see
See bein wit a skirt but she can't see beatin me
Cuz I'm a mack like that, and I pack like that
So if you wanna get wit me and work the track like that
Bringin in them revenues, shit
From him to her to they which one you choose

Chorus

The advances startin enhancin early on
You was mouthin, there ain't no doubtin, singin my song
I exit stage right, hopin I might not tweak
Off of all these freaks that come out at night
Freak 1 wanted to lick under the sun
Freak 2 wanna 68 my whole crew
Freak 3, haha, proposed to me
Freak 4 was knockin on my hotel door
Freak 5 was already inside he wanted to showcase live
His talent, me and my homegirls like, right
For you to strip teast for me
I could easily use the entertainin
If thats what makes you feel famous
Now me I got ya open, ya strokin yaself to do it
How about that party in ya pants but I'm not comin to it
Now who's the next man to put his hands up
Miss rhyme with the superstar, she catch ya when I stand up
