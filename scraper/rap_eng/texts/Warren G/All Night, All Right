If you feel it in your soul
Let the music take control
All night, all right
Time to get your party on
Do it till the break of dawn
All night, all right

Everybody knows about the place to be
Especially on a night like tonight
And baby I can't help but thinkin' you should be with me
At ten to two a two's a ten
I'm about to lose control

If you feel it in your soul
Let the music take control
All night, all right
Time to get your party on
Do it till the break of dawn
All night, all right

Like to see you movin to your favorite tune
The way you work that body gets me in the mood
I can't help but wonderin if you'll stay with me
It's ten to nine you're lookin fine
And I can't help but vibe, vibe
Cos honey you are on my mind, so fine
Wanna see you groove all night, all night, all night long baby
Can you help me
I'm about to lose control

[Warren G]
I'm a rip this track and stay down
Who, what, European throwdown
Sixteen bars of the sound
So when I rip this smoke a pound
Get down, get down
Peter Andre in your town
From the UK England sound
To the Long Beach stomping ground
Now, when I say hey, you say ho
Throw your hood in the air if you want some mo'
Do the ladies run this, run this? Get down, get down
Do the fellas run this, run this? Get down, get down
Do the ladies run this?

If you feel alright
If you feel it in your soul
Let the music take control
All night, all right (all night, don't you know)
Time to get your party on
Do it till the break of dawn
All night, all right (all right)
Why don't you get your party on

If you feel it in your soul
Let the music take control (till the break of dawn)
All night, all right (all night)
Time to get your party on (wanna see you move)
Do it till the break of dawn (baby can you groove)
All night, all right (all night, all right)

Get your party on
Till the break of dawn
Wanna see you move
Baby can you groove
All night, all right

If you feel it in your soul
Let the music take control
All night, all right (all night)
Time to get your party on (let's go till break of dawn)
Do it till the break of dawn
All night, all right

If you feel it in your soul
Let the music take control
All night, all right
