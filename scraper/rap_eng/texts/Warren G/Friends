G and Snoop, homeys from the jump and the get go
Devoted and quoted back in 84
Growin up in the LBC
Platinum city, where the big gamers be
Involved in everythang from Pop Warner
To whats poppin on every corner
Find a skirt if you wanna
Tryin to come up in this world
Where everything is drama
Beverly was like my mama
W-A-double R-E-N
Tryin to get in where I can fit in
Catchin a bus with a homey I can trust
3 homeys from the hood straight kickin up dust
Enjoyin my days and everythang is fine
15 years old Snoop d whoop on the grind
Tryin to find ways to make it, dice shake it
Young, havin fun, like me Snoop and Nate did

Chorus
We be havin fun, no one could do the things that we do
We be havin fun, no one could do the things that we do

I remember all the scams we been through, together
Nobody does it better on which you do the weather
The days we used to call first year playin get like me
Gettin in fo of zines, I loved em
Long Beach was the hometown
And every spot that we rocked, you know we got down
Outside at the club just spittin raps
And every busta that ran up was gettin cracked
Underground tapes used to be the claim to fame
Long Beach Was A Mutha was a classic mane
Tellin tales about how we was strugglin
And surrounded wit tha homeys that was all clubbin
Tryin to make it in this music
Quick fast, quick cash, and hittin on the quick dash
We in this game to make hits
And make everybody respect the G-Funk click

Chorus
We be havin fun, no one could do the things that we do
We be havin fun, no one could do the things that we do

We went from young G's
To sellin million overseas
Rollin Dees
And makin money by the trees
To killer Bees, evading all enemies
Catastrophies, young GFC's
We made it now, livin good wit no hassles
But still a lot of problems dealin wit shady acts doe
Its all a part of makin hits doe
See our careers take off like a US missle
Break out the crystal
I spitted it, and now its g funked out, transmitted it
So you can call it what you want
We still goin bring the funk
G's up put it down, and ya weed to float

Chorus x3
