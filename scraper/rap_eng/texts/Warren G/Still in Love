[Verse 1]
Music open up your arms, take a brother in
Bass take me to a place I ain’t never been
My ink pen touch pace, take my pain away
Songs, take away my wrong, make it right again
I know we’ve been through some bad shits
A lot of ups and downs, just me and my bitch
But every defeat only made me stronger
I rose to my feet and I stood up taller
For you at the end of the day
When I say I'm gon' stop this shit, turn around and walk away
I can't, ‘cause that bitch pay a nigga so good
I wouldn’t do it different if I could
‘cause it’s me for you and you for me
And all I see is you and me
Baby, I’m

[Hook]
Still in love
Sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey
Still in love
Sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey
Still in love
Sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey
Still in love
Sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey

[Verse 2]
It feels like we’ve been together for so long
Me and my two turntables and a microphone
Hold on tight, I can’t let you go
Bringing Snoop to Dre? That was a stripper’s stool
Building blocks, west coast infrastructure
From hip hop to the whole gangster rap culture
First California nigga on Def Jam
Nowadays niggers getting signed out of webcams
Look at some of these damn labels I grew up with
They got rich and switched up on some other shit
We millionaires, damn near billionaires
I’m like damn, I helped all these fools get there
But now niggas only call when they need something
I’m in the lab, puttin' to Al Green
Baby, I’m

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain’t write this for nobody, I ain’t trying diss nobody I’m just being real
Up and down since training wheels
And I’m fly, no co-pilot
Now what you know about it?
Me, my stuff and I, respect my rep
West up, chest up, vest up
Recognize the real lies, who’s next up?
If you ain’t ready for a ride, don’t step up
I’m OG’ing the lane, gotti in the league
So how the fuck you gonna coach me in your league?
Put the wrong out fire for another kush tree
Haven’t seen more dollars that you ever could see
Sum it all, rap it ain’t nothing but love
I’m just saying what’s on my mind
Baby, I’m

[Hook]
