(INTRO)
He he ha
I'm serious nigga one of ya'll niggas got some bad mothafuckin
Breath up here hey baby hey baby hay baby gimme some
Bubble gum in this mothafucka somethin man lets gone
And get somethin to eat study long study wrong nigga

With so much drama in the LBC
It's kinda hard bein' Snoop D-O double G
But I somehow, some way, keep comin'
Up with funky-ass shit like every single day
May I kick a little somethin' for the G's and make a few ends as I
Breeze through two in tha mornin and the party's still jumpin
Cause my mama ain't home

I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till 6 in the morning (six in tha mornin)
So whatcha wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my home boys do too
So turn off the lights and close the door
But for what--we don't love dem hoes
Yeahhh so we gonna smoke an ounce to this
G's up hoes down while ya motherfuckas bounce to this

Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice
Laid back--with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice
Laid back--with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody's got their cups but the ain't chipped in
Now this types of shit happens all the time
You gotta get yours but fool I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you're listening to the D O G
I got to cultivatin the music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And to mackin' this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the home boys' lady (Oh that bitch)
80 degress when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N.U.T's
Could you get some of these at ease
As I rhyme with the dog pound feel the breeze
Biyatch I'm just

Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice
Laid back--with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice
Laid back--with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Later on that day my homey Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat-ass J of some bubonic chronic that made me choke
Shit--this ain't no joke-- I have to back up
Off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin' I'm still poppin'
Dre gots the bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me--not with a cherry on top
'Cause when I bust my nutt
I'm raisin up out the cock

Don't get upset girl that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes--I'm out the door
And I'll be...

Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice
Laid back--with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice
Laid back--with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice
Biyatch--with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice
Biyatch--with my mind on my money and my money on my mind
