[Verse 1: Warren G]
This DJ, he gets down
Mixing records while they go round
To the hip to the hop, you just don't stop
Producing funky tracks til it makes you drop
Conjunction junction, whats my function
I'm hookin up tracks so that niggas can function
It's not Pete Rock or that nigga Dr. Dre
It's this muthafuckin nigga from around the way
The one that brings you styles on timesy, whymsy
Thats why it's so hard to find me
Conduction, construction when I bust choo choo, bustas
It's a must when I bust when I bust, I gotta come correct
The R to the E to the S-P-ect architect
Yup nigga no I'm not tweaking
Its one of the sixteen minds that I'm speaking
The W-A the double R the E into the R
A-B-C-D-E-F to the muthafuckin G
Ooh shit as I flex I wrecks I checks
So what's next

[Verse 2: Mr. Malik]
Oh who's next, to catch wreck on the menu
I snap necks when I flex let me continue
Send you, on a mission when I rock
It goes on and on and on and you know it don't stop
Yes I'm back on another route, ready to take em all out
Now can't get with this, cause they get faded without a doubt
Check em, I wreck em like 1-2-3 why
They can't fuck with that rude one Malik
Will I drop it, can't stop it, lit it up like a rocket
When they get out of line I grip the nine out my pocket
Lock it down yeah that's what I do
How could you come solo nigga when I run through your whole crew
I rule, fool, act like you heard it
The one I run with, can't remember the last he murdered
Dem do away or dem get dealt with
Kill the noise I want silence, no bubbaclad bullshit
Nigga, it's all about my grip
So the one who starts to slip is the one who gets ripped
Kept a chip on my shoulder not now that I'm older
They, all of me, the LBG high roller
Cause back in the days on the side where we sat
Niggas come up missing if they didn't have they strap
So why, try to be, like me
Just when you pull back a G and I think I'm Mr. Malik

[Hook]
Well if the beat is funkadelic then the tune is right
Mr. Malik and Warren G so tonight's the night that we spark
We spark in the dark when we do it in the park

[Verse 3: Mr. Malik(Warren G)]
Well its the A to the B (and the C to the D)
Hey my name is Mr. Malik with that DJ Warren G
(Mr. Malik can you hear me)
Yes I'm the host with the most they can't get close or even near me
(I said a tick, tock, ticking to the era)
I said a pick which Glock bitches get shot its still terror
(Terror, terror, pick which Glock)
Which one, (the black one with the big pin lock)
Me and Dre in a five hundred so those who wanna get dropped
Nigga go knock, knock I trick a flow non-stop
Fly double I never slip trip or flip flop
The tune is funkadelic, the crew was right
But if Malik will make you smell it then tonight's the night
For me to stay trump tight up with my nigga Warren G
That's sorrow when you borrow but you can't be oweing me
What's next

[Verse 4: Warren G]
I say what's next, what's next what's N-X-E-T
It's me, Warren to the muthafucking G
Flowing with my little homey named Malik
Yes everybody will just tweak
Off the new style ill ease that we got
Yes it's me Warren G on the block
Pump pump, block Glock, let me just tick tock
It's me Warren G on the muthafuckin rock-n-roll
Stroll, then stiff back to the rap
Its me with the big black mack eleven strap
So let me flix into the flex
Woo, so what's next

[Hook]
Well if the beat is funkadelic then the tune is right
Mr. Malik and Warren G so tonight's the night that we spark
We spark in the dark when we do it in the park
