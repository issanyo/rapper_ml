Warren g verse 1:
Every now and then i feel a little about it
The VIP get a little crowded
You should see the piece with the diamonds inside it
Its so vibrant, platinum all around it
When i take flight, how can i stay grounded
Got the 2 6 pep boys been around it
Shawty wanna shake the spot like right now
5 cut a cranberry saturn right now
Mama got back, pretty little thang
Kicked in the door with bullied out the game
PYT, pretty young thang
I told her cross over stop messin with the lames
Switchin 4 lanes like money ain't a thang
I got on 4 chains like money ain't a thang
Yeah girl this is us tonight
Take her back to the crib we gon crush tonight
Right?

Ray j chorus:
Oh baby, dont u rush, dont u crush

Warren g verse 2:
So now we in the coup, starin through the roof
Your face like a model your body through the roof
Champagne by the bottle, now we in the loop
Im g'd up, with doc i be swimmin thru the loot
Anything for my boo, from fashion to asprin
I told pops u the one u could ask me
Flashin the necklace, the ring like a fitty
We can leave the country have sex in the city
Any soakin the till takin shots like biggie
I realised i got my own style like diddy
