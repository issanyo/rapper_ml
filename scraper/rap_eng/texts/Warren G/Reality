I don't know why they mad at me
They can't catch me but still they after me
When we deal face to face, its a tragedy
You ask why i got my gun they might blast at me
Real niggas, real shit, reality
Who gives a fuck if you niggas is mad at me
Fuck around with Warren G its a tragedy
Real niggas, real shit, reality

Warren G top dog
Patrollin' the beach
Niggas say they as hard as bitch
But they're as soft as a peach
Claiming the G of all G's
Please
I come blowin' through like the breeze
Sittin' on threes
Post it
Coastin' mashing down Pacific Coastin'
The bomb chrome rims black on black Yukon
With nuts hangin' from the city
Where the bangers be banging
It don't seem like shit is changing
I holla'd at the homey the other day
G'ded up at the park sippin alize
One of the homies took a beating
So now we spend at being a gang
Of checking at the meetin' like cycles repeatin'
It's just another sunset fall in sea
I can hear the homies in the past callin' me
And you know what I discovered
What they keep saying
Keep your mind on your money
Muthafucker's and shake busters

Chorus

Have you ever sold millions
But yet you niggas persist to talk shit
Get off my dick
You never catch me slipping
Rollin' with the heat
Slap the clip in
I never thought the world would start trippin'
My life is a trip, though
Hit the crip though
Blow the whistle
They think I banged
So I packed a pistol
Warren to tha G is a G
I don't fuck with you nigga
So don't fuck with me
Let's ride to the east side
Slide like a fo
I packs a fo-fo
When I'm steppin' out doors
To the bang to the boogy
If I speak then I spoke
Warren G do it every time to you Locc
Get the party beat like blaze and smoke
The east side and the beach
West side of the coast
You know the niggas that I ride with
Hogs, attack dogs
The same niggas I'm down to die with muthafucka

Chorus

Who's the man
I've been from London to Japan
Stomp land to land
To the Egyptian sands
You can't check me
Dis-respect me
Or mop me up
With the base bumpin' out my truck
And all these police trying to lock me up
Money rules the world
And I made the loot
So don't make me shoot
Cuz trying to mash
Will get you done every time
I ain't trying to hurt nobody
But I'm down for mine
