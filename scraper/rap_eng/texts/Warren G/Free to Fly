[Intro]
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Betty Who]
That moment when I know, I know that his towel was thrown
And I'm done with hurting, yeah
I'm gonna make a friend 'cause enough's enough, so I need a touch
And my hand ain't working

[Pre-Chorus: Betty Who]
Don't care what they have to say
I'ma do me anyway

[Chorus: Betty Who]
Hey, hey, dance with me
Just one sip and I'm feeling fine
May be hard to breathe
Hole in my heart, but I'm still alive
I'm solo, I'm high, I'm solo at night
Hey, hey, dance with me
I'll get mine, I'm free to fly
(Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit)
I'll get mine, I'm free to fly
(Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit)
I'll get mine, I'm free to fly

[Verse 2: Betty Who]
I lost my identity, I was wrapped in you, it was absolute
Now I'm finally seeing, yeah
That I'm a brand new queen, I don't have to ask, I'm the quarterback
Of my own damn team, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Betty Who]
Don't care what they have to say, yeah
I'ma do me anyway

[Chorus: Betty Who]
Hey, hey, dance with me
Just one sip and I'm feeling fine
May be hard to breathe
Hole in my heart, but I'm still alive
I'm solo, I'm high, I'm solo at night
Hey, hey, dance with me
I'll get mine, I'm free to fly
(Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit)
I'll get mine, I'm free to fly
(Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit)
I'll get mine, I'm free to fly

[Verse 3: Warren G]
He did you wrong? I'll do you right
He beat you up? I'll beat it right
He speakin' bad, I'm speakin' poetry
You over that, now you rollin' with me
No questions, no lies
Beautiful lips, beautiful eyes
All I ask is you keep it 100
And if you act right, you got me 100

[Chorus: Betty Who]
Hey, hey, dance with me
Just one sip and I'm feeling fine
May be hard to breathe
Hole in my heart, but I'm still alive
I'm solo, I'm high, I'm solo at night
Hey, hey, dance with me
I'll get mine, I'm free to fly
(Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit)
I'll get mine, I'm free to fly
(Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit)
I get mine, I'm free to fly

[Outro]
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Hey, hey, hey, hey
