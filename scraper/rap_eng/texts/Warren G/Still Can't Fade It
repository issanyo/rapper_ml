(Chorus)
You can never fade thee G they're so crazy
When they start to blaze after dark
You can never fade thee G they're so crazy
When they start to blaze after dark

Now I can take you on a maze of thangs but all I know is street life
20 some years and all I lived was the urban life
Shootin dice smokin weed gettin my hustle on
Makin anybody raise up that try to do me wrong
Me and the homeys on the move tryin to make a grip
Bumpin OGs in zone when we dip
Not to trip, unless you trip
Automatic will release
Dangled as peace
I'm stayin soldier to the streets

So tell me how do you feel cuz I can't deal wit the anger
You niggas be givin I'm keepin one in the chamber
The pressure is thick so I dont quit shootin game
And peepin our enemies violatin in my range
They say it dont change and heres a fact you should know
That niggas dont hustle no matter where yo ass go
So when you think wrong
I'm thinkin right, are you prepared to meet
Gotta be wise cuz everythang ain't what it seems to be

(Chorus)
You can never fade thee G they're so crazy
When they start to blaze after dark
You can never fade thee G they're so crazy
When they start to blaze after dark

Warren G-
In 6 before out shacks, cruisin each block
I'm lookin for a space with my 40 Glock cocked
Temple, Salt lake, 21st Lewis
I hits MLK cuz I know I gots to do this
Some people say Warren would you please stick to rappin
But this fool's pressin me so I gotta start capping
187 now I'm stuck out of luck
In the high powered module lookin crazy as fuck
LBCing to the fullest 21, dominoes
Buck wheats, french braids and naked four doors
Its my city, my city's all good
Warren G kickin back with the Twinz in the hood

(Chorus)
You can never fade thee G they're so crazy
When they start to blaze after dark
You can never fade thee G they're so crazy
When they start to blaze after dark

Tripp Locc-
Press up if you want to, believe that you'll get your feelings hurt
All you hear is the chirp, along with my wheels as I skirt
You shouldn't of tried to fade the Locc there ain't no get back
I meant that, get ready for combat its like that
Prayin that my homeys dont flip as I elevate
Bringin nothing but heat stayin away from the weak links
Be your own man survive
Make that money grow
Whether it comes fast or it comes slow

Wayniac-
Either way it goes we step so I stick and move
Refuse to lose I choose to get the blues
Paid dues for years, but where were you niggas then
Out flossin the boulevard being hard wit your friends
While I was at home puttin in work
You think you goin jerk
And take whats mine get me twisted with a skirt
I notice the difference cuz I been back
On niggas they true
But now I see it and its on since its like that

(Chorus)
You can never fade thee G they're so crazy
When they start to blaze after dark
You can never fade thee G they're so crazy
When they start to blaze after dark
