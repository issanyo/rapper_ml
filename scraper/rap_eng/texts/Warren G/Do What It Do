Intro* Ooh yeah, yeah, What's
Love got to do Warren
G rap, for me yeah-eah, yeah, mm, mm Verse

* 1 When G-dog the, hog come, up in the place There's
Dollar signs in your eyes and a smile in your face You
Wanna live fat all, for my sack You
Got more drag than a low lo-do cut, the act 'Cause
Back before '92 and '93 You
Didn't give a damn about Warren G But
Now that I'm slingin' platinum lp's All
Of a sudden you, on my N You. T's. Ain't
Nothin' you can do to make it stop 'Cause
Money makes the world go 'round and the panties drop I
Ain't in love though I, don't need the pressure I
Just wanna dig it like I'm diggin' for treasure Some
Of y'all had a good thing that you couldn't keep Thought
You was tlc you, had to creep You
Say you had love I, said you need to quit It's
All about the dough so, what's love got to do with it Chorus?

* What's love got to do got, to do with it (that's right) What's?
Love if you don't respect the game (uh-huh) What's?
Love got to do got, to do with it If?
You lack in this game it's, a shame you, won't make it Verse

* 2 Now I'm, the type of brother that's down for mines Before
I made beats I, was down to grind Back
Then every, single homey had my back Now
They're peepin' my stack and they're talkin' bout jack But
I'm the same brother day in and day out And
I'm-a stay that way until the day I lay out in a casket It's
Drastic 'cause, homies is plastic Break
'em off some bread they, want the whole damn basket If
You's a true homey you, would wish me well Not
Plot to see a brother fell jealous, as hell We
Used to get the same riches Now
Your trigger-finger got the itches schemin', on my riches Which
Is not a suprise my, eyes peep game 211's
187's, it's all the same It's
All a shame homies'd, jack you for your grip Ain't
No love involved because, it's all about the chips Repeat

* chorus Verse

* 3 Now for these labels tellin' fables Makin'
The messed-up deals under the tables You
Think that you smart but, fool, I'm, the smartest You
Can't make no money if you can't keep an artist Sign
The dotted line put, 'em on the shelf Break
'em off some crumbs keep, the rest for yourself I
Know how it goes treat, an artist like you know Fly
Cars gold, clothes, but, no dough Since
It's all business I'm-a, handle mine Keep
Track of my stack down to the very last dime 'Cause
In this rap game it's, all about the buck You
Bend over for the label and you will get bucked Like
How we run up in the skirt and, then you're through The
Record label do the same thing to you 90%
Business 10%, show Ain't
No love in this game 'cause, it's all about the dough
