My homie baby mama trying to fuck me
Would I be wrong if I let her suck me?
It ain't me, it's her, dogg, she'll tell you the same
She don't belong to you man, she belong to the game
A lil' nasty scandalous individual
Hittin' you for you chips and all your residuals
See, bitches do the same thing
To athelets and entertainers and hood niggas
Cuz, we in the same game
I don't know why it's like that
When I was growing up I remember bitches wouldn't fight back
Now these hoes push the game and they wanna strike back
I treat a bitch like Tina, that mean I'm like Ike, I guess
Back-back-back to reality you funky hood rat
You good for nothing shit talking bucked mouth
Want some real shit I give a fuck about
How the bitch feel if she get killed?
I don't give a fuck and I don't think I ever will

We started off friendly fucking
I thought it wasn't nothing but nothing
Then all of a sudden her nigga started loving the muffin
She got a husband, he be gone a lot
So we be fucking in they home a lot
Shopping his expenses while he on tour
I pedal to the floor on one of his Benz's
Flossing for my friends and shit, spending his Benjamins
Then all of a sudden it came to an end and shit
Once he saw me and his dame pass
Walking in the rain holding hands talking about his lame ass
And how we entertained for my gangbang ass
A man jumped out with his thang ready to blast
Ski mask over his face, I reached to grab a 38
That I grabbed from her husband safe
I blast a couple to his face and made it to her tilt
And she checked her answering machine, her husband got killed damn

She thought I was gone
Thought I left on tour today
Far away
Thought I was in another place
When the dog's away
Funny how the cats will play
But-but baby girl
I saw you and him walking in the rain

She thought I was gone
Thought I left on tour today
Far away
Thought I was in another place
When the dog's away
Funny how the cats will play
But-but baby girl
I saw you and him walking in the rain
