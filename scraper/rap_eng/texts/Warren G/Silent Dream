When it comes to reality, I don't know how anybody stands it (face down)
Straight spastic, stretch my emotions like elastic
Through it, I have to stay sarcastic
Trying to learn how to stay sane like Scholastic (yo)

Motherfuckers trying to go and ruin me
Oh gee, you don't have anything better to do?
You're going through, like that's new
Your plan's see-through
And when it doesn't succeed, you a fool. (boohoo)

I'm detrimental to the bottom line of success
What I really have to say, I have to keep recessed
The inner workings of my brain are a mystery (and a mess)
What the fuck I'm gonna do? I'mma make history

Falling down through the stairs of life (told you dog)
There's always a conflict, nothing but strife
A civil war between two families
The only peace is one silent dream (so sad)

There's only a silent dream
Attempting to mend a broken seam
There's only a silent dream
Attempting to mend a broken seam
There's only a silent dream
Attempting to mend a broken seam
There's only a silent dream
Attempting to mend a broken seam

Some people might argue that there's always the future
Well, I know the future; and stability's still just a rumor (ouch)
My friends, they'd sooner bail if they had to help
Any cries for anything, they; always a yelp
Whelp, I'm fucked; anybody want some coffee? (Yeah)
Don't get cocky, you're only worthy of one cup. (oh.)
What a dump, I can't believe they approve this stuff
Wanna know what I'm talking about? Well, tough. (Shit)

It may not be as rough as any other guy
But morally? They trying to buy my support. (wow)
Don't contort the action
Just so it gains traction
Fuck your interactions
You just want a good reaction

Take me away, subtraction
Once I'm with you, satisfaction
Maybe I should be glad they ain't fascist
But then again, nobody can be glad for madness

It's the saddest that these feelings come in masses
Who do I choose?
They all come the fastest
Who's the baddest
Which one's are classless
Nobody has good morals, thank god I practiced

There's only a silent dream
Attempting to mend a broken seam
There's only a silent dream
Attempting to mend a broken seam
There's only a silent dream
Attempting to mend a broken seam
There's only a silent dream
Attempting to mend a broken seam
