[Chorus]
No matter where I go
I'm lettin' people know
No matter where you go the grass is always green
No matter what you say
You gotta' release the chains
I think it's time I set my spirit free

[Verse 1]
No matter where I go
I'm lettin' people know
That the pace is never stalling
Even if the sky is falling
I'll never be afraid
As long as I keep my faith
Even if I am still crawling
Won't be mad cause some are balling
But man without the trust, without the loyalty
When you watch your dog  just starving
Don't get mad when they start barkin'
Here's a suggestion man
Why don't we just wash our hands
Cause I'm peepin' other pastures
I think it's time I'm my own master

[Chorus]
No matter where I go
I'm lettin' people know
No matter where you go the grass is always green
No matter what you say
You gotta' release the chains
I think it's time I set my spirit free

[Verse 2]
Long ago I told my homie
Some people are so damn phony
Sure as the wind blows
They'll try to take your dough
On and on man they just keep comin'
'Til I'm dead man I'm never runnin'
Fear I just don't know
If it's your time you gotta' go
But what about the trust what about the loyalty
When the have no respect for you
It's fuck 'em or call your lawyer
Here's a suggestion man
Why don't' we just wash our hands
Cause I'm peepin' other pastures
I think it's time I'm my own master

[Chorus]
No matter where I go
I'm lettin' people know
No matter where you go the grass is always green
No matter what you say
You gotta' release the chains
I think it's time I set my spirit free

[Bridge]
Here's to my family
Here's to the ones I really love
Here's to the inmates
And that's who made Death Row #1
Here's to the foundation
And that's where, where it started from
Here's to real freedom
They tell me makin' music's fun
When you got no shackles on your feet

[Chorus]
No matter where I go
I'm lettin' people know
No matter where you go the grass is always green
No matter what you say
You gotta' release the chains
I think it's time I set my spirit free
