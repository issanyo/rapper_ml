[Trip Locc]
Now my day begins late, had to get some sleep
Ridin passenger in a Suburban peep
We had a ball last night, me and the crew
I'm sayin thanks to you, my homeys sayin thanks to you too
But that was yesterday, today is up for grabs
Stomach hurtin like it took a gang of jabs
I need the scoop, thats what I'm sayin laid back in my room
Wait a minute let me call my ace coon boone
I know he know where it is where it was and where it's goin be
There's no answer so I guess the alley got dressed
Time to do some sellin myself
I bust a right make a u then I make that left
Straight subbin on my neighborhood (shit boobin)
Stuff bangin like a concert
Girls on the stroll tryin to flirt
Swoop across the light black and white lookin hard
Maybe someone else but I neva pull my card
I'm in the wind

(Chorus) x2
Things have changed but it still don't mean you forget all the time you spent
Runnin around, havin fun, no one could ever take the place of it

Who woulda thought when we was young this would be
The same old click that ran around in elementary
Was it the chemistry from moms and pops
Who went to school with they moms and pops, so it dont stop
It was an everyday event, we spent
More time playin get like me, instead of hide and seek
And after school we play two on two
Philly versus the Lakers until the bus came through
Do, you, recall goin to the games
Straight actin the fool and when its over at the food chains
In the parking lot is where it all pop
We hangin around to watch the ladies and the brothas clown
Pick up some food, conversate a bit
Till its time for us to make our move, then dip (then dip)
I enjoyed, every minute of it then
I guess thats why we in the wind

(Chorus) x2
Things have changed but it still don't mean you forget all the time you spent
Runnin around, havin fun, no one could ever take the place of it

7:45 its time to make that hit
I'm in the back of tha apartments where my homeys kickin it
Thinkin bout my homeys thats gone and the ones locked up
Slappin bones gettin faded and toe up
Makin a gang of noise
Domino gimme what you got in yo hand
Ya didn't stand a chance
Count my money, gimme 25
By spots and hit the door, I hear somebody knock
Damn how time flies when you havin fun
All the things we did when we were young
Still stayed deeper than the mind
As time is passed
I had more thoughts of good than the bad as I laughed
Cuz me and my homeys still hang ain't nothin changed
But the years and months, bringin in some bucks
And this is why we stay true to the end
Now me and my homeys are in the wind

(Chorus) x4 (fades)
Things have changed but it still don't mean you forget all the time you spent
Runnin around, havin fun, no one could ever take the place of it
