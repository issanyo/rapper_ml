[Intro]
Hey
Baby...
Alright, Alright....
Hey....

[Verse]
Woke up this morning dealing with a feeling that I had deep inside
Trying to think in my mind why is it that I'm feeling right now

That I can't be living, can't be actually excelling and seeing something
Different within my life except the epitome of he who be struggling

Trying to be having something different in life
Tell me what it is really, that you really be feeling in life

Is it really you can be succeeding and seeing something
Believing the very thing that you actually been dreaming brother

Now is you feeling what I'm feeling, is you hearing what I'm hearing
Different voices in my mind trying to make me feel like my dream gone die and can't be witnessed

Having me thinking inside
Can I be one of those who be bling blinging shining alright

Well pimpin I, want to be he who see something new and enriching
But it's not just for me getting bigger figures and riches

Trying to be an example and role model for others
Letting them know they don't have to hit that cold bottle, brother

Pimpin wake up now, different things going on in your mind
Trying to make you feel as if you gotta be he who do die

Can't see nothing and be nothing, actually receive the very thing
You be believing brother

What do it be, uh huh, I don't even know now
But I'm telling you, deep inside of my soul I

Be feeling as if, I be on the edge nigga
In the sense of any minute, one two three boom, next thing you know I be dead nigga

Yea nigga, that's the way I be, feeling
And sometimes I be reminiscing bout this life that I'm living

Back in the past when I was wondering, if I could ever
Be one of those known to have that one that I could love forever, yes sir

Growing old with, never growing cold to
But being that one that I can always be known to go to

Whenever the struggle, whenever the strive, whenever the fight
When different things coming against me in life

Try to make me feel like I can't be succeeding
I don't know what's going on, but maybe I'm just fighting demons

Whatever the cost nigga
Whatever the path I gotta be taking best believe I'm gone be taking it, even if I gotta take a lyrical AK man

Laying 'em down, all of my opponents
Whoever
Try to come against me and try to have my dreams be eroding

Cause I'm trying to maintain focus
This ain't none of that hocus pocus bogus yo that I'm flowing

Kickin' it dope, kickin' it raw, kickin' it hard straight from the heart
Letting you know on the real I never be flaw

I be he who be moving and he who be pursuing righteousness
Trying to let you know on the real what it is, in this life we live

Like I said on keep it real pimpin' and keep it real pimpin'
You know what it is on the real I'm trying to say for real pimpin'

When I flow rhymes, I don't be lying and I don't be trying
To be one of them brothers who let the figures and riches blind

Me in my mind, pimpin' naw
It's more to it
You know what it is on the real you just gotta keep keeping it true pimp

1 double 0 and pimpin', never be he who do lie
Never be he who do set yo brother up, naw

You want to succeed right, want to see things g double o-d right
Want to be one of those known to live the life where you actually succeed right

Well then you should first of all be true and real with it
And genuine with it, don't be trippin' with it, now pimpin' listen

I know sometimes you often be thinking in your mind
Well if he get more figures and I don't partner

Well that mean he gone be seeing more then me
And that mean that my heart gone be growing, cold you see

And that mean I ain't gone have nothing
And it's gone make me wanna go grab something

That go buck-buck-buck-buck
But pimpin' just listen up

You ain't gotta be trippin' and flipping the script like that
Hold ya head up
Pimpin' just keep on doing your thing yea, you gone get ya bread up yes sir

You don't have to be he who do struggle
He who do feel as if you can, never ever come up

You can grow now, and pimpin' I know now
Sometimes in your own mind
You feeling like man, freak this I'mma take my own life

[Outro]
Hey...
It ain't easy....
But do your best...
To keep your head up, hey...
