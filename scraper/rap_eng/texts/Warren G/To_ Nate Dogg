[Hook: Wanz]
Let's smoke a little bit
And drink a little bit
Let's party all night
You better come on
Let's smoke a little bit
And drink a little bit
Let's party in the spirit
Of the Dogg, Nate Dogg

[Verse 1: Warren G]
Smoke, Smoke
Pour out a little liquor
And have a gangsta party
Cause I miss my nigga
Six dudes sitting clean outside
No Auto-Tune, Nate Dogg in my ride
No Beegees, OGs in my ride
Hoodrats with tattoos screaming "eastside!"
Damn, cuz
I miss buddy love
Barbecue at King Park
In the memory of
The low low hitting switches
All my bitches
And three wheel motion
We west coasting
In the city by the sea
Call it 213
Nate D-O-double-G
On me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Grynch]
Uh, I'm all up in the party, just posted
Zoning out while the DJ playing west coast shit
Regulating the sound, it's getting explosive
The barber make it bounce, just like a six-four switch
And cracking women, they gon' come
And plus the homies here cause otherwise it ain't no fun
You feeling me? The year, man you know these songs
Here's another g-funk classic with the homie Wanz
You know we gone, hella folks blowing trees
Got a glass of 'yac (?) that this chick is pouring me
(?) and (?), shouts to Crytical and Warren G
Gotta say it one time, Nate Dogg, R.I.P
The game ain't been the same since he passed away
So I play his records all the time to bring him back today
Voice unforgettable, forever so incredible
Still, nobody does it better, no

[Hook]

You know it ain't a party until I step on the floor
Bottle in hand, plus I got a pocket full of that dro
We here to have a good time so you already know
If you got a chip on your shoulder, leave that shit at the door
You ain't gon' fuck up my night, cause I ain't having it, homie
Low tolerance for bullshit, you understanding me, homie?
Look here, roll up a smoke man, and pour you a drink
So you can get off in the spirit, dawg, and party with Nate
I feel honored to pay respect to a legend
And, uh, I believe all dogs go to heaven
A west coast pioneer and truly one of the best
Had a style of his own and stood out from the rest
If you from the west, throw your w's high
Grab a drink, two-step, and move from side to side
And I think it's about time we sparked one up in this bitch
So we can smoke a little bit while we drink a little bit

[Hook](x2)
