Beeping of alert signal
Ensign:  Captain, the transporters ready
Captain:  That's hip.  Lieutenant Marvin, what is the condition
Of the planets surface?
Marvin:  It is difficult to be precise.  However, my instruments
Indicate a condition of extreme rigor mortis, spreading rapidly
Throughout the population.  Highly illogical, Captain
Captain:  A bunch of stiffs, huh?  Well, set coordinates for, ah
Chocolate City, and have a landing party of nine men beam down
Immiediately, with phasers set on funk-funk!
