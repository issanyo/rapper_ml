Fuck nigga, they don't see the line
Try to put you on just a chick
You'll probably on the phone with your bitch
I just found out, admit it that you ride with a snitch
You probably on the phone with yo bitch


And I got a plug, shit look good as a mug
But you probably on the phone with yo bitch
Nigga I'm done, I'm finna go get this mud
While you probably on the phone with yo bitch

Nigga you stupid, need to get yo ass straight
Why you think you don't make as much as your men make?
Gone on the syrup, ain't no pancakes in sight
Ain't fuckin with yo niggas, actin like a dyke
You squirt on that split and it's makin you lazy
Kid boy watch us clear, signal as a watchin T-U-B
Them niggas with the players, let me Q-B
Doin you ain't workin right now so bro do me
You actin like a batch my nigga
No homo that my nigga
I'm only speakin facts my nigga
The world judge us by racks my nigga

So, ass in yo line real quick
You probably on the phone with yo bitch
I just found out, admit it that you ride with a snitch
You probably on the phone with yo bitch

Get yo ass off that couch
Bro, get yo ass off that couch
For that girl kick yo ass out
And you be stuck, now you down
Hallin blows
Ask the girl to spend the night
Ask then can you borrow clothes?
For real, she done get there
I know cause nigga I done been there
I was like you, somebody told me
And if I don't say nothing I ain't yo homie

So ass up, I'm tryna you the shit
You probably on the phone with yo bitch
I just found out, admit it that you ride with a snitch
You probably on the phone with yo bitch
And I just got a plug but you ain't goin with nobody
You probably on the phone with yo bitch
I just found er
Can a nigga callin you
But now you probably on the phone with yo bitch
