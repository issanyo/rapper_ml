Verse One:
[Tripp Loc]
I'm riding high with Warren G, Wayniac sendin back G funk like we should be
(So What's up then?)
Fresh back from the other side of the country gone for two Weeks But then it seems like eternity
I must admitt Amsterdam is the shit got the BombAt the coffee shop, keep us niggas lit
Came to speak kick my shit get the Dividends, ball at the Pound Arena on the weekends
And think about the Things People do, stay true and watch out for the devil tryin to get you
It's the Tripp ya Gotta feel my combo, need on the records yo I'm like pronto
I let it flow Like a pro
Prepare for the worst, I got you hooked on only one verse
So when it drop
And Doin it'll groove ya, Twinz in da house and ya know we're gon move ya

Chorus:
Just lay on back
Fire up a sack
And keep my conversation
(Staying real is the key for me you see, yeah)
Won't steal ya on
'Long as you stay strong
And keep my conversation
(So take a journey wit me
So you can see what I see)

Verse Two:
[Wayniac]
I kinda know what you mean and it's a trip how we went all over the world I'm
Seeing things I never saw
And only better to understand, that life ain't Easy for the Woman or the man
So I continue on the journey for life, holdin on stay Strong for The next breed of mine to fight
It's only right I do what I can do than hand You the Blueprints the evidence to better get
What you need is some sense of Direction
Without this stress, we know the world is a mess
So as I ride I'm layin back Flippin Day by day runnin play by play for a brighter day
But it seems I can't let Go of my Ways 'cuz others stay jealous about my pay, but anyway
Stay smart and never Fall up in that trap, if you want it go and get it like Tripp and the Wayniac

-Chorus-

Verse Three:
[Tripp Loc]
You see it's all in a day's work, and some's there to get em gon to get it Can you
Dig it
I gotta have it touched down and go for to lovin every minute that I'm chillin Wit my crew (lounge)
We do what we gotta do and it's a shame with the game Put A young black nigga through
So take it from the Loc, everybody wanna get Paid Nobody wanna be broke, I hope
I rest my case, I'm off to the paper chase, no Time to waste, I need it so they stay
A nigga's in the driver's seat, must Be the Beat to make my freak complete, when I speak nuttin but dopey
Come on and Creep and get a piece of my potion full of motion, got ya floatin. It's like Smoke And hella get whatchu need and the Twinz set ya mind at ease

-Chorus-(x2)
