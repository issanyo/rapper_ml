[Hook: Warren G]
No static when it's cool
No static when you got a lotta crew
And you're always on the go
Gettin' to it like you're supposed
No static when it's chill
No static when you kinda got a feel
For somethin' on the real
Livin' life for what it is

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Today might be a good day, feel it in my bones
The sun shine, she make the flicker from off the chrome of the wheel
What good is the bass if you don't hear
Them tweets got to be clear as glass
Brush my teeth and wash my ass
Prep my beard, press my clothes, soap, water, rags
Can't be busted with these Jordans
Krit spend a lot you can't afford
So I'm Moonwalkin' out the crib, flex
Lint rollin perpetrators and boppers off my fad
Crank the whip once, pressed, gas slammed
I got an automatic

[Hook: Warren G]
No static when it's cool
No static when you got a lotta crew
And you're always on the go
Gettin' to it like you're supposed
No static when it's chill
No static when you kinda got a feel
For somethin' on the real
Livin' life for what it is

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Now propose I break 'em off somethin' proper
I got more colors in my paint than Cyndi Lauper
Radio take check, I get my partner on the phone
Like 'what's on deck?', shawty bet that up, set that up
Cool, just hit me when the drink fall through
I got a couple darlin' nicki's just for the crew
Talkin' 'bout, there's some single chicks to mingle wit' and smash
They ain't the clingy type, they only here for fashion
The camera flashin', they smokin', drinkin', put some cash in
One of them classy, I peeped her ass through her khakis
I told her that my mouth piece everlasting
Then I got her automatic

No static when you kinda got a feel

Livin' life for what it is

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Domino's slammin', five deuce four tray
And sticky icky, rollin' liquor, flowin' niggas ain't playin'
No static, no static mothafucka
No static, no static mothafucka
Slip and slide up and down the boulevard
Creepin' when you do it like I does it when we buzzin', no sleepin'
No static, no static mothafucka
No static, no static mothafucka
Got the radar on checking for the laws, we ain't trippin
If the neighbors call, tell us keep it down we ain't listenin'
No static, no static mothafucka
No static, no static, got an automatic
