WARREN G:
It was a clear black night
A clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets
Trying to consume some skirts for the G
So I could get some funk
Rollin' in my ride
Chillin all alone

NATE DOGG:
Just hit the eastside of the LBC
On a mission tryna' find Mr Warren G
Seen a car full of girls
Ain't no need to twee
Girl you skirts know whats up with 213

WARREN G:
So I hooks a left on 21 a Lewis
Some brothas shootin dice so I said 'lets do this'
I jumped out the ride
And said 'whats up'
Some brothas pulled smoe gats so I said 'i'm stuck'

NATE DOGG:
Since these girls peepin me
Ama glide and swerve
These hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb
Wanna think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckas all in his mix

MICHAEL MCDONALD:
I keep forgettin we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin

NATE DOGG:
I laid all them bustas down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switchin my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirt sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb

WARREN G:
Now Nate got da freaks and thats a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, Back up, cause' it's on
N-A-T-E and me the Warren to the G

MICHAEL MCDONALD:
I keep forgettin we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin
Everytime I......

NATE DOGG:
Just like I thought they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G child were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell I said 'ooh I like your size'
She said 'my cars broke down and you seem real nice would ya
Let me ride'
I got a car full of girls and it's goin real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

WOMAN/MICHAEL MCDONALD:
I keep forgettin we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin

WARREN G:
I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G Funk step to this I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level

NATE DOGG:
The rhythm is the base and the base is the treble

WARREN G:
Chords, strings, we brings melody, G Funk where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm

WOMAN/MICHAEL MCDONALD:
I keep forgettin we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin
