[Intro]
Money, Bitches, Power
First you get the money
But the money brings the bitches
Then you know you got the power

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
To some of all who’s about to end, remind me of grace
That’s before the tension again and the summer relates
It’s the cold trips, cash claims, pole and it’s priceless
When I’m reflectin ices, aroma icy
Winnin to every nationality in the spring
When they flip chiller to get a glimpse of scene
Highlights of highlights, all sights to set
Behind that, behind rights life is falling away
Behind lights, high end flights, privacy on this jet
Scrupular locks be when knocks is bigger as that
Snoop is an icon, I kinda figured he’d get the respect he deserves seein what he did in the west
Life? No complaint, sober a year
Holdin it steady, livin trippin in over the fair
Over the top, underneath and over the stairs
It’s a step, taking another step closer to where?

[Hook x2]
My brother was about to come
I’m over living trouble son
I’m over with the other ones
Where everyone is number one
Where everyone is number one
Where everyone is number one
Where everyone is number one
Where everyone is number one
