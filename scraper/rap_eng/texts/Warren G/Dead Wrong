She said she wants to come over tomorrow
But I see two dudes and they look like trouble
The doorbell just rang, so I grabbed my pistol
She thought she could set me up, she was dead wrong

[Verse 1: Warren G]
Once upon a time, not long ago
I had to go and put the smash down on this ho
Never been the one to chase nothing but my dough
And I never waste time, I stay ready to go
She was thick, lightskin, with the prettiest eyes
Type to make a nigga listen to the silliest lies
But I don't believe her, I see through her disguise
But she so bomb, a nigga had to give it a try
I met her at the club, she was sipping Mojitos
Shots of Patron had me ready to beat though
She told me she was ready to come over and chill
Told her, "hit me on my celly if you really for real"
Out the corner of my eye I observed
A couple unsavory characters in the cut, the nerve of this bitch
I hope its not what it's looking like
Shit, I guess I'm 'bout to find out tomorrow night

She thought she could set me up, (uh huh, okay bitch)
She was dead wrong

[Verse 2: Warren G (Nate Dogg)]
On the phone she was sounding sexy
Talking all nasty, reckless, acting real extra
I think I hear her nigga's voice in the background
Whispering, something funny style going down
Doorbell ringing, I'm at the peephole with the strap
I ain't hear them coming from the back
I bet they thought they had me, but that fully automatic
I let all them niggas have it
The bitch got it first of all for tryna trap me and set me up
I had to show her what's happening
Damn, why she wanna stick me for my paper?
Blam, right between her eyes with that laser
One shot (one) two shot (two)
Three shot (three) four (four)
Gun cock, unlocked, bodies on the floor
I had to do what I had to do
If it could happen to me, it could happen to you
