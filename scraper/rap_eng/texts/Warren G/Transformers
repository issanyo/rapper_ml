Microphone check one two uh
And you don't stop
Microphone check one two uh
And ya don't quit

Microphone check one two one two
Let me clear my throat so I can do what I gotta do
It's expresso, mandle that I'm stacked
Niggas, tryin to corner the market but I'm back
Bang to the boogie, and boogie to the bang
It's G-Funk for life sewing up everything
Little locs, pay attention
Do I or should I have to mention
44 ways where the grass is greener
From OG to BG is a misdemeanor
St. Mary's Hospital, 10:20 AM
On the street called Atlantic is where I began
Ola May, uh, thats my lady, she made me
On a street under the bridge called hill, thats where she raised me

(Chorus 4X)
Transformers, busters in disguise

I say chitty chitty bang bang
Brothers wanna gang bang
Tryin to represent but dont know about the gang thang
21st where it all begun
Begun us on the corner with the homies havin fun
I was a youngsta, peepin from the other corner
Seeing sets in the air with big arms now I wanna
Be like them, and act like them
And stack like them and try to mack like them
Shit, its hard being Warren G from the LB
And like the G's before, you know me
So I'm a stay down, for the eastside
Not like you busters, transformers in disguise

Chorus

One to twenty-one, and you know I ain't gonna stall
I gotta give it up with the homie roll call
OG cry baby, and the homie big roc
Mooch on the side with the stockin can ride
Big sugar mama, flee bag and
Lady roe guard and marathon they OG see
Salt Lake crew got little shorty Charlotte
But back to Louis with T-Bone is where I started
Livin in the back in a little pink shack
If you know like I know then bounce to this track
Cerritos bounce to this
21st bounce to this
I said Lewis bounce to this
Salt Lake bounce to this
Under the bridge bounce to this
Elm St. bounce to this
710 bounce to this
P-A-C's bounce to this
MLK bounce to this
Locc St. bounce to this
1-9 bounce to this
20th bounce to this
Lemon bounce to this
