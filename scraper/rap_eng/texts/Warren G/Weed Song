(Hook, Frank Lee White)
We just, tryin'a find a place where
We can smoke our, weeeeed
(Warren G)
Wit' out nobody fuckin' wit' us at all
Walk wit' me now
(F.L.W)
We just, tryin'a find a place where
We can do our, thiiiiing
(Warren G)
Wit' out nobody fuckin' wit' us at all
Walk wit' me now

(Verse 1, Warren G)
Well it's Frank, the bank, roll a tank
Roll the white, dolomite, takin' over the mic'
I like, what I'm feelin' here
See me man, standin' here, puffin' on that hemisphere
Come a little closer girl, I think I see a blemish there
Anyway, let's get back to the program
Get a strawberry Swisher, let's smoke man
Long as I'm wit'chu, we gon' be up in the clouds
High as a kite, and I ain't comin' down
(Down South) We be on them peach White Owl's
Frank Lee White, bout to smoke another ounce
I heard in Cali, they got that purp
Tryin'a figure out a way to cop that work
Soooooooo, bless me
With another blunt of 'Droooooooo
My chest feel like the shit about to blow
The whole world's spinnin'
Gimme a couple zones, and room full of women
And I'm straight
