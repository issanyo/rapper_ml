[Intro]
You may be black, you may be white, you may be Jew or Gentile
It don't make a difference in our house

My House

[Verse 1: Warren G]
My house, my pool, my sofa, my couch, my roof, my ceiling
My floors, not yours
My cars, my bikes, my rings, my yard, my hood, my corner, my gang
(My house)
Niggas don't play around
My killas will lay you down
My city, My town
Nigga, that's my stomping ground
My streets, my homies, my turf
My people since birth
With heaters under they t-shirt

[Hook]
My House
My, My, My, My, My

[Verse 2]
My hoes, my caddy, my foes
My drink, my smoke, my suicide doors
Kush blowin', remy pourin'
Don’t trip you know where all the bitches goin', hehe yeah
My plaques, My Chauffeur , My Chandelier
My mirrors, my dishes, my silverware
My silk, my leather, my suede
My steak, my milk, my bacon, my eggs

[Verse 3]
My carpet, my pillows, my rug
My marble, my granite, my wood
My curtain, my shades, my blinds
As far as my eyes can see, it's all (My House)
My sink, my closet, my minks
My socks, my draws, my charms, my links
My bank, my money, my savings
My burner on my waist, don’t try to run up in (My House)

[Hook]
