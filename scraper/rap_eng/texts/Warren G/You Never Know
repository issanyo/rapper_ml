(Snoop)
Got a little something for the summertime
While you on the grind
Getting yours
Hell yeah! I'm getting mine
I take trips and dips just to recline
I blaze up the orange weed
To relax my mind
Spend time with my kids on the weekdays
And I holla at my momma and my
Grandma on the threeway
She say, If you do right
Baby boy I promise you live
A long life
I can't argue
I try hard to
Not blast niggas
I walk past niggas
With my head up to the skedai(sky)
Nigga tried to pull a fast one
On Snoop Dogg
To get some shut eye
What I do to him I can't speak
You know the episode
And the code on the street
I keep it all the scriffin' y'all
But real street for y'all
Cause you never know
When you're gonna go, no

(Chorus)
You never know where this road's gonna take you
Got to be strong
You got to hold on
Cause you never know, where
This life's gonna lead you
Just Hold on
You never know

(Warren G)
]From the killing
The robbing
The squabbing
And jacking
Car jacks to kidnaps
What? Niggas be acting a fool
Trying to set me up at the park
But I'm cool
Act a fool
My daddy said throw them thangs
And stay strong
My momma got sick
So I'ma keep it strong
As long as I got my feet in the game
And make this beats
And bring heat to the game
Fuck the fame
I got a little boy to see through
And him without me
Is like me without you
Keep it true
And stay down for your grips
Homies and licks staying tight
Like this
You never know

(Chorus)

(Phats Bossi)
You niggas never know
Which man are blasted for
Never know which man to kill
Just to settle the score
It wasn't long ago
I had this partner of mine
Knew him just a short time
But he's stuck in my mind
My nigga lived perfect
Said the streets wasn't worth it
If you don't die rich in the game
Then what's the purpose for this struggle?
We stay piece to puzzle
Invest half the wealth
And pray to god it double
We just in this
Trying to get rich at the interest
Keep it pimping
Stay with niggas that's relentless
Smoke dough
Just because I say so
Money pronto
And niggas never would know
They never know nigga

(Chorus til fades)
