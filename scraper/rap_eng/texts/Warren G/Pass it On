Twinz-
Uhhh.. two hits then you pass it on, take two hits then you pass it
Take two hits them you pass it on, pass it on pass it on

I got my droptop back, layin low in my seat
On a mission headin down the backstreets
Its 12 o'clock gotta get my sack
If I can't get my sack then its time to scrap see (time to scrap)
Ain't nothin poppin if I can't get high
On a high tip gotta get some chocolate thai
Now, I see the homeys who be slangin doves
Roll up on him, man its on break me off my love fool (whats up fool)

Stop at the store to get the zig zags (zig zags)
Not knowin that the homey in the back had a whole bag
Of them licorice ones already rolled
Take a hit god damn you just saved my soul
Two hits pass it on they say
But I'm a get high everyday all day (all day)
And thats how it is when ya spin
Cruisin while I'm floatin with my kin fool

Chorus (Warren G)
Two hits then you pass it on, take two hits then you pass it
Take two hits them you pass it on, pass it on pass it on

M&M-
2 o'clock AM vision hella blurry
Barely woke so this locc keep swervin
In and out the lanes tryin to get to tip
Seems like its takin forever and thats on the real
Have some chocolate thai but the indo seems stronger
Smoked a newport to make my high last longer
Rolled up another so pass me a lighter
And fire it up, so I can get higher
Took a hit then I closed my eyes
I can't smoke no joint without my homey St. Ides
Rolled to the store ain't shit you can tell me
My eyes were so red that Visine couldn't help me
Took a drink to the head now its kickin in
And the tide done hit me so my head starts to spin
I rolled the windows down then I leaned to the side
(cuz some think its wrong) but you know how I ride

Chorus (Warren G)
Two hits then you pass it on, take two hits then you pass it
Take two hits them you pass it on, pass it on pass it on

T-Dubb-
Now here I come slidin through, with my crew
The homey's on focus so check the real view
We roll the back door cut so we could plot
To hit em up and roll em up and get to the weed spot
We get the sack give em daps then we break
I thought it was on but see my homey Bo's in shape
But that ain't no thang yo, so roll up the window, Twinz got that
Indo
I thought you knew so now its on like that black
I love to hit the Chronic and I'm bombed off contact
I'm with the skirts gettin love
Now should I fire it up (man hit that shit T-Dubb)
Thats the lick so now I stare
From rollin through the hood they got big respect (yeah)
Eastside's where I glide
So take a dip with a locc and hit em up two times right

Chorus (Warren G)
Two hits then you pass it on, take two hits then you pass it
Take two hits them you pass it on, pass it on pass it on

Twinz-
I hit the corner, guess who's at the red light
One time's there and they got me on sight
Switched lanes straight G (straight G)
If its on then its on 5-0 gotta catch me (gotta catch me)
Its off to the freeway locc
A cup of gin in my lap with the Chronic smoke
You can't beat it with a bat
AC just a blowin and my seat's laid back (laid back)
Slapped the homey on dippin in the 82
Doin it like a locc like the thang to do
Gotta always put it down for my niggas restin in peace
The ones locked up that might not never touch the streets
Every toke that I toke is for my muthafuckin locc
Take no shorts as I blaze up some mo smoke
Its just a lil somethin just to let you know
That the real Chronic smoke is on the go
So I'll..

Chorus x4
Take two hits then you pass it on, take two hits then you pass it
Take two hits them you pass it on, pass it on pass it on
