[Intro]
Metro
We done came up dog and never look down
I might gotta throw my Jesus chain on for this

[Chorus]
When you put the work in man it shows
Straight up out the ashes then I rose
I done hit a all time low
Been at a stand-still and had to go go go
Man they out here on a scheme like la-la-la
Breaking promises you need like na na na
No hearts, no love, no kumbaya
No hearts, no love, no kumbaya

[Verse 1]
Everything automatic so I can't waste time
And if we break up I only make up time
My team do this shit easier than lay-up lines
Never scared to cross that line or pay up fines
Look, Don Don Don, that's my top 3 in the order
Never took a shortcut
Need a crib off the lake
Backyard look like a short club
Shoutout to my loyal ones, I wish that it was more of us
Went from 30,000 a year to 30,000 feet as my floor plan
I got El Chapo with a choppa as my doorman
I'm on the other side taking care of what's important
If business not boomin' then it's time to change the format
Time to change the recipe, I'm special especially
Going for the record, no felony
And I'm dodging jail and jealousy
Day dreaming about a cruise with Penelope
Looking like success fell on me (damn)
And get rid of all that jealousy
All that hate in your heart
I ain't got no enemies
I'm focused on what's meant for me
Putting my energy back into me, real shit

[Chorus]
When you put the work in man it shows
Straight up out the ashes then I rose
I done hit a all time low
Been at a stand-still had to go go go
Man they out here on a scheme like la-la-la
Breaking promises you need like na na na
No hearts, no love, no kumbaya
No hearts, no love, no kumbaya

[Verse 2]
Boy this shit intricate
Working like a machine, they keep trying to throw a wrench in it
But I'm too intuitive and into it
No ghostwriting, no sixth sensing it
That's why all this shit sound so intimate
That's why I feel like you know me before we face to face
As for the latest, I'm the greatest Ali Bomaye
I put that work in overnight like that shit due today
I paint the pictures they can't trace, try and you get erased
I'm less focused on props and more on property
Done put so much back in my hood that I changed the economy
I'm 'bout to build a movie theatre downtown properly
And help revive the heart of the city, just keep on watching me
And if these bitch ass niggas got they wish and stopping me
Just know I done done so much good business in my life
That there's gon' always be a job for me, a op for me
I never burned bridges so there's a hundred ways to get where I gotta be, Don

[Bridge]
Same people, you see on the way up
Same ones you gonna see on the way down
You feel me?
You love me, I love you
You hate me, I love you, straight up

[Chorus]
When you put the work in man it shows
Straight up out the ashes then I rose
I done hit a all time low
Been at a stand-still had to go go go
Man they out here on a scheme like la-la-la
Breaking promises you need like na na na
No hearts, no love, no kumbaya
No hearts, no love, no kumbaya
