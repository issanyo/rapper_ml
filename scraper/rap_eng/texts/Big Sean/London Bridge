[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I don't mean to sound hysterical
But baby if you left, baby if you left
It'll be a historical disaster
The kids will sing about it swear the kids will sing about it
Like the London Bridge is falling down
London Bridge, London Bridge
Like the London Bridge is falling down
Falling down, falling down

[Refrain: Jhené Aiko]
I heard everything must come to an end
Well hopefully the end ain't near
Or for that matter even clear
The only thing that matters is right here
Like the sky, the sun, the waterfalls
I decide when I'm gon' fall
I can't tell you everything I don't know
Oh baby I can't tell you everything I don't know

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko & Big Sean]
I don't mean to sound hysterical
But baby if you left, baby if you left
It'll be a historical disaster
The kids will sing about it, swear the kids will sing about it
Like the London Bridge is falling down
London Bridge, London Bridge
Like the London Bridge is falling down
Falling down, falling down

London bridge is falling down,  that's what it would be without you

[Refrain: Jhené Aiko]
I know everything that starts has an end
Well hopefully the end ain't near
Or for that matter even clear
The only thing that matters is right here
Like the stars, the moon, the waterfalls
I decide when I'm gon' fall
I can't tell you everything I don't know
Oh baby I can't tell you everything I don't know

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko & Big Sean]
I don't mean to sound hysterical
But baby if you left, baby if you left
It'll be a historical disaster
The kids will sing about it, swear the kids will sing about it
Like the London Bridge is falling down
London Bridge, London Bridge
Like the London Bridge is falling down
Falling down, falling down

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Who would have ever thought that we would fall like London bridges
I know you heard the rumors about me lies and superstitions
Heard but ain't choose to listen that’s what made you different
And you keep me driven guess that’s why I could see us going the distance
On nights you text and text and text with no auto corrections
Misspelling every other word but I still got the message
And you get carried away like you wearing wedding dresses
I'm sorry I even ever gave you reasons to question
Cause you make me feel like the chosen one
Eight billion people in the world and I still chose the one
Answer this question and I'll answer what you asking me
What happened if we got in an accident died tragically
And next lifetime you remembered and had to come after me
And convinced me that we not meant to be that have to be
And like the defending champs you had to win it all back for me
Just got to know how deep is our love actually
What if this was the end and we had to bow out together
I need you to tell me every emotion like now or never
Only two times I ever needed you was now and forever
Don't know what else to tell you

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko & Big Sean]
But I don't mean to sound hysterical
But baby if you left, baby if you left
It'll be a historical disaster
The kids will sing about it, swear the kids will sing about it
Like the London Bridge is falling down
London Bridge, London Bridge
Like the London Bridge is falling down
Falling down, falling down
