[Verse 1: Chaos]
Now I have fallen to the venom trying hard to love these women
Once bitten twice shy, another try twice bitten
I been looking for a wave I let them ride and then good riddance
Cause I never got a high that wasn't lowered when it ended
At first I never listened long enough to catch my interest
Then i gave my all for nothing thats a gift that keeps on giving
Turned my life into a living, promised i would share it with em
Let em cuff me, went from feeling love is locked
To being locked inside a prison
Tryna find keys to my heart retrace my steps to the beginning
I just want keys to your thoughts
Then I'll unlock your real intentions
Talking feelings till we feel em and the exes back to get me
And I'm feeling like theses feelings only lasting for a minute
Paid my dues she say I didn't fall in love and end up injured
Said I'd write a song about it, couldn't talk it out we end it
I've been restless tryna live through
All these reckless bad decisions
I can't really make em for you though don't worry though forget it


[Chorus]
See I came up
I came up but ain't change up
We change up and then break up
We make up and then made love
I hate love cause it's dangerous
I can't love cause I can't trust
I Fake love I got banged up
She hang up in my face but
Feels like I deserve it
Feels like I deserve it
I feel like I deserved it
I probably deserved it


Hoes would say we need a break, I plan vaca to Cartagena
I've been told we needed space guess they really are from Venus
They all Ed Gein at saving face I'm surprised I didn't see it
Harvey Dent call it a threesome, half an angel half a demon
Damn I'm feeling like this is a bad time
Can we just wait like the last time
Damn i really don't why you're mad I'm
Really not kin to your bad side
Ma'am I seen that your mood has been bad I'm
Doing whatever to mask mine
Can you stop tryna tell me you love me
I'd rather you tell me that that's mine
I feel you should probably relax I'm
Still who you chill with for that right
You lose some and fall and get back
That's real in the end know that that's life
You telling me things have been bad but
Damn they were good in the past time
Ticking I'm living to pass time
Still i just feel I should ask why
Damn am i worth it, better or worst
You give in or give up whichever comes first
Hoes looking for amen but never in church
They waiting and waiting want better then search
Good guys finish last, and i never was first
Attachment was magnet to metal it worked
Wanna act bet your action was better rehearsed
I been heartless too long a breaks hella deserved
Guess it gets better with words
Lessons for better were learned
This is a letter to her
Wait for the message returned

[Chorus]
See I came up
I came up but ain't change up
We change up and then break up
We make up and then made love
I hate love cause it's dangerous
I can't love cause I can't trust
I Fake love I got banged up
She hang up in my face but
Feels like I deserve it
Feels like I deserve it
I feel like I deserved it
I probably deserved it
