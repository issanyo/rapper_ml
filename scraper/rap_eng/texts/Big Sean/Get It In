[Intro]
Whoa, whoa
I take it back
Take it back, back

[Verse 1]
Back when [?] yellow Hummer (Chop Squad)
Back when I had a job every summer (summer)
Back when I tried to be the number one stunner (stunner)
Back when everybody in the band had a drummer (brr)
Back when the medical insurance was just the hunnids (hunnids)
Back before it was so easy to get a number
Back before George W. used to run it (run it)
Back when me an' all my dogs used to go huntin' (huntin')

[Chorus]
Boy, we used to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
You know we had to get it in (you know I had to get it)
You know I used to get it in (you know I used to get it)
You know we had to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Schemin', whole team just schemin'

[Verse 2]
Okay, me and my whole team seem to put it all together (go)
It's time to make the moves that's gon' put us on forever
'Cause they stay down like my foot did on the pedal
Hold up, stay down like they shootin' at me
But they never, I can never take you bitches personal
I brought the money outside-in like it's reversible
I'm QB on my team, yeah, so don't rush (rush)
Bitch, start actin' like a grownup (okay)
M-moving like a boss do
Pimp enough that I can pay for law school (yeah-yeah)
I was raised by a O.G. one (free one)
Talk to me like I'm Obi Wan (boy)
Business moves, you know we don't discuss
All twenties, talkin' area touch (whoa)
Still runnin' with the dogs like mush
'Cause the only ones we trust is us, an' hell yeah

[Chorus]
We get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
You know we had to get it in (you know I had to get it)
You know I used to get it in (you know I used to get it)
You know we had to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Schemin', whole team just schemin'
I'm talkin' plottin' an' schemin'

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Boy, we used to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
You know we had to get it in (you know I had to get it)
You know I used to get it in (you know I used to get it)
You know we had to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Schemin' (yeah), whole team just schemin' (schem, yuh)
I'm talkin' plottin' an' schemin'

[Verse 3]
All I ever did was figure it out (go)
Back when a nigga used to have to live on the couch (uh-huh)
I [?] on this shit just to get through the drought (straight up)
I strategised it in my head, then started livin' it out (go)
Man, these niggas want the perks without doin' the work (work)
Drag my name through the mud without doin' the dirt (damn)
I get your face on a shirt like I'm doin' your merch
They love to talk, I'm 'bout doin' it first, 'cause

[Chorus]
Boy, we used to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
You know we had to get it in (you know I had to get it)
You know I used to get it in (you know I used to get it)
You know we had to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Schemin', whole team just schemin'
I'm talkin' plottin' an' schemin'
