[Intro]
Welcome back, welcome back to the very very very late night show
I’m your host like every night LB
And uhhh we got two of the biggest stars in the world right now
I mean, we can’t go anywhere without hearing their names
Now you two usually keep it private but you’re about to open up and uhhh I guess we’ll start with you
And tell us how you’re feeling

[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]
See I’m a real woman
A women that doesn’t need much but
Appreciates a whole lot
And he always call me crazy, but i’m not crazy
I’m from LA where the sun’s always shining so a lot of people are shady
But at least I got my baby

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Yeah, right baby
Right, look
What’s the difference between real love and fake love
The same difference between real titties and fake ones
You can feel the difference
And even though it changes overtime
It stays consistent, I ain't gonna lie though, it takes persistence
But you the one I wanna be with when the ball drop
That’s why I send for you like the call drop
Plus I know all your insecurities
And I don’t mean like mall cops
I mean the type we all got
I’m never focused on my exes more than our execution
No time to be stressed and confusing
A happy home is the best to move in
Just like happy endings can be the best conclusion
My dad used to say real love can be the best illusion
Because when you think it’s there, it’s already moving
And some feelings will leave before the rest can move in
And I know both of our families are divorced and suing
But look, this ain't repetition, it’s evolution
You changed the theory up
You the type to have the hardest nigga tearing up
And all your friends around you try to get their appearance up
When you ain't even wearing much
But real enough to remind me to hit my parents up

[Interlude]
Wow. I mean… make some noise for em'
Everybody, make some noise
I mean that’s, that’s real love you know?
That’s beautiful. Makes me want to call my wife up and tell her I love her. You seem like a stand-up guy, like you really have her best interest… oh

[Verse 3: Jhene Aiko]
Yeah he’s sweet
I mean you know when he wants to be not all the time
Let’s not front in front of all these people nigga
Don’t act like just a couple weeks ago you wasn’t fucking with them bitches
Out here, disrespecting me
I mean you know I fucked up too
Went through your phone you wasn’t looking
And I found out, but if we in the same house, the same building
Then you can’t interrupt a happy home that’s still buildin'
You ol’ sneaky ass nigga

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
Fuck is you saying
Who are you talkin to
Never called you a bitch, but who are you barking to
Look you disrespecting me, calling me a lying ass nigga
Who are you trying, am I on trial?
Are you not the number one on my speed dial
You know that you tripping
You need guidance
You got these people inside our business
Like U and I is
You probably didn’t even catch that did you
You’re too undivided
You’re too undecisive
You’re too one sided
You the type to kick me out the house after I buy it
And then talk to me like you’re the pro when I’m the one that’s been providing
I hate talking about what’s private when we not in private
‘Cause I don’t want to say nothing to piss your mother off
Since we inviting everyone in the bedroom
Let’s take the covers off
And talking about how you fucking what’s his name who’s so fucking lame
I wish I would’ve known before I took the rubber off (ah!)
Got me questioning like is this even love at all
I used to see my future in your eyes like the crystal ball
Looking for some feelings in the lost and found
Contemplating
Thinking how we supposed to hold each other down if we can’t even hold on a conversation
You take the sex away then what else are we left to lay in
I’m tired of fronting for these people who ain't got our back
‘Cause to them it’s all entertainment
And they not looking at us like we real people
Or like we up here just fuckin playing
And time’s the only thing we can’t afford
Then why would waste it
How we supposed to face our problems
If we can’t even face to face it

[Outro: Big Sean]
The fuck
Fuck this shit
