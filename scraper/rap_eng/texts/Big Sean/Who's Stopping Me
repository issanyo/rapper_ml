[Intro: Nazaré Pereira & Big Sean]
O sol vive sem﻿ amor
Eu não vivo sem te ver
Quem chega na maré cheia é cantiga de bem querer
(Shit sound like Narcos)
O sol vive sem﻿ amor
Eu não vivo sem te ver
Quem chega na maré cheia é cantiga de bem querer
Metro Boomin' want some more, nigga
(Bitch)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Big dawg, autobiography
Make moves with the bros, no choreographies
She told me I'm the one, I looked over, said obviously
Then looked up in the mirror like, who the fuck stopping me, huh?
Who stopping me, nigga?
Shit, who stopping me?
At the top, my girl the only one on top of me, nigga
Who stopping me? Huh?
Who stopping me?
Keep, keep it going, don't stop for me

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
All charged up, I could glow in the dark (dark)
Sent a text to your girl, I think we growing apart (whoa)
Sleeping with one eye open like I'm throwing a dart (whoa)
Leaving the crib a hundred deep like we going to march
Okay, I pin her on the wall like she go with the art
Trying to keep up with me, oh, I know that shit hard
And I'm going too far
Niggas ask me who I'm going with
I told them my heart, the best beat thus far (the best)
My dog Earlly telling jokes, man I'm laughing at that
I had a dream I rode with Rosa Parks in the back of the 'Bach (damn)
And we was blowing a blunt and she was packing a strap
Like damn, it do feel good to be black in the back
Going so far back, it felt like I was back in the ac-ura (swerve, swerve)
Tryna bring it back home like, up bat
You're up, I love pussy so good
It taste like syrup, mixed with Ciroc, and coconut (whoa)
A slick bitch will make you tie your laces
I'm never getting sick, sipping ginger echinacea
Divorced, being broke, yeah, I need that separation
To make that paperwork for me and my 'ministration (for the dawgs)

[Chorus; Big Sean]
Big dawg, autobiography
Make moves with the bros, no choreographies
She told me I'm the one, I looked over, said obviously
Then looked up in the mirror like, who the fuck stopping me, huh?
Who stopping me, nigga?
Shit, who stopping me? (who stopping me?)
At the top, my girl the only one on top of me, nigga
Who stopping me? Huh?
Who stopping me? (who stopping me?)
Keep, keep it going, don't stop for me (don't stop)

[Bridge: Big Sean & Nazaré Pereira]
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Yeah, if Lil Metro don't trust you, need shots (bah! bah! bah!)
(Don't stop, don't stop)
O sol vive sem﻿ amor
(Don't stop, yeah)
Eu não vivo sem te ver
(Shit, you know I ain't gon' stop)
Quem chega na maré cheia é cantiga de bem querer
(Nah, you wanna, you said take your clothes off?)
O sol vive sem﻿ amor
Eu não vivo sem te ver
(Yeah, take that shit off, do that dance I like)
Quem chega na maré cheia é cantiga de bem querer

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Don, Don
Look, baby, I want the full thing, not the teaser (no)
Fuck a teaser, I'm the full feature (whoa)
This African-American express mixed with this Visa
Can get me in and out of anywhere I need to (oh God)
And no more disrespecting me
We grew up poor, I changed my whole family trajectory (respect)
You couldn't see these type of checks if you was Einstein on Jeopardy (whoa)
Self-made to make that hell of a recipe (goddamn)
And if you not down with me, you offending me (no)
I'm so righteous, I'm praying for my enemies (pray)
'Cause they gon' need that shit for whatever they go and guess on me (yup)
Turn they ass to history then get back making history
See I'm the type to get a check and invest it
Buy some land and protect it (whoa)
Live off the interest and give my family the rest (straight up)
And then start from square one on some first cigarette shit in a whole new direction (Don, Don)
And I pray you got the courage to flourish
On all your urges, whether it's a new dream or refurbished (whoa)
Understand nothing's off limits if it's on this Earth, bitch
So let's get to work, bitch

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Big dawg, autobiography
Make moves with the bros, no choreographies
She told me I'm the one, I looked over, said obviously
Then looked up in the mirror like, who the fuck stopping me, huh?
Who stopping me, nigga?
Shit, who stopping me?
At the top, my girl the only one on top of me, nigga
Who stopping me? Huh?
Who stopping me?
Keep, keep it going, don't stop for me

[Outro: Big Sean]
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Yeah, if Lil Metro don't trust you, need shots (bah! bah! bah!)
