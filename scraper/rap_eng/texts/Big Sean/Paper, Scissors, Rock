[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Baby girl, I think we need to sit and talk, talk, talk
Playing with my money, paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock
Blowing up my heart then stick a pen and pop, pop, pop
Even you could leave it, don’t know what you got, got, got

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
I could be wrong, you could be right
You'll probably be alone, I'm probably not
Well listen girl, you acting like an idiot
Really tryna love you but it's getting hard, hard, hard

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Is you crazy? Did you lose it?
Are you stupid? Are you foolish?
Girl, I'm the only one like me on the planet
It don’t take rocket science to understand it
You paper, scissors, rock my world, girl am I the one you playing?
You paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away
You throw it away, throw it away, th-th-throw it away, throw it away
Paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
Well I can take you back to the spot you was bought, bought, bought
Make ‘em return my paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock
Maybe you can think about the shit and stop, stop, stop
Climb up on this boat and show me how you jump, jump, jump

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland & Chris Brown]
I could be wrong, you could be right
You'll probably be alone, I'm probably not
Well listen girl, you acting like an idiot
Really tryna love you but it's getting hard, hard, hard

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Is you crazy? Did you lose it?
Are you stupid? Are you foolish?
Girl, I'm the only one like me on the planet
It don’t take rocket science to understand it
You paper, scissors, rock my world, girl am I the one you playing?
You paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away
You throw it away, throw it away, th-th-throw it away, throw it away
Paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Okay woah there, woah there, is your noodle? Cock-a-doodle?
Are you crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy? Did you knock a couple screws loose?
I know what time it is, only cause you cuckoo
I got bitches jumping for me like a bouquet by the beaucoup
Are you tryna leave? Oh, you tripping, tie your shoe lace
You’s a dime bitch, cause you two-faced
And you gave me heads and tails
Throw it at me baby, I be the Wishing Well
For real though, I know our shit's not perfect
We connected then need space, swear our love is written in cursive
Put that rock up on your finger, paper in your hands
But you can’t cut me out, bitch this ain't no game

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Is you crazy? Did you lose it?
Are you stupid? Are you foolish?
Girl, I'm the only one like me on the planet
It don’t take rocket science to understand it
You paper, scissors, rock my world, girl am I the one you playing?
You paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away
You throw it away, throw it away, th-th-throw it away, throw it away
Paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away
