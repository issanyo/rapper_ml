Part 1: Money Problems

[Intro]
Hey
God damn, God damn
Hey (God)
Hey
Oh, yeah, yeah, haha, true

[Hook 1]
Money, money, power I need checks in every week
Four Season, nigga, I need breakfast in my suite
Niggas don't make money when they disrespecting me
You would think they got a check, the way they checking for me, no

[Verse 1]
Every time you see me, I'm in go mode
Niggas ain't 'bout to charge up, blowing smoke (smoke)
When I drop, a few niggas is goin' ghost
You gassed up, thinkin' we go toe-to-toe, aye
I'm bout to go Kanye West on niggas
You know care less if I upset some niggas, hey
Supposedly I've been in debt with niggas
Fuck 'em, I ain't writing out no check for niggas
My lawyer check them niggas
Said "Don't sweat them niggas"
Order lobster for breakfast and dinner
He talkin' wild, I said "Objection", nigga
You a lame, get up out my section, nigga
Hey, he throwin' shade, I don't play fetch with niggas, yeah
Big money, still I rarely flex on niggas
Don't need attention, just respect from niggas
Oh, no, all I really need is, need is

[Hook 1]
Money, money, power I need checks in every week
Four Season, nigga, I need breakfast in my suite
Niggas don't make money when they disrespecting me
You would think they got a check, the way they checking for me
I need money, money, power I need checks in every week
Four Season, nigga, I need breakfast in my suite
Niggas don't make money when they disrespecting me
You would think they got a check, the way they checking for me

[Verse 2]
No way

Oh, I come a long way
Yeah and it's been a while since I clocked in
Came out on top and
Shawty tell me I'm poppin'
Might miss a concoction
Yeah, pour me a drink up
When these niggas start wildin'
Yeah, you the one that I think of
And God, he the only one thing keepin' you niggas from gettin' sprayed up
For my daughter, I'm gangster
For a dollar, you a traitor (Traitor, traitor, traitor)
You got money problems, I'm sorry (Hey)
Ain't no money problems ever stop me (Never)
I just treat a prayer like a hobby
And then I prosper to godspeed and it got me

[Hook 1]
Money, money, power I need checks in every week
Four Season, nigga, I need breakfast in my suite

Money, money, power I need checks in every week
Four Season, nigga, I need breakfast in my suite
Niggas don't make money when they disrespecting me
