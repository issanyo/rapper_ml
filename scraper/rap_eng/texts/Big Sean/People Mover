[Hook x2: Pat Piff]
D.O.T. bus number nine
In these streets, never on time
Can we get the people moving?
Yeah, im the people mover
Can we get the people moving?
Let me take the people mover

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Big Sean
You can't fight this
With no matches
Im enlightened and im nicest
As an [?]
Call Mastercard cause he priceless
You can't buy this
They wanna turn around and ask me how life is
Its tee-riffic
The American Dream?
He is it
He lives it
He get the people moving like they evicted
I spit C.L. smooth over that beat box
Then get a verse from Piff, now thats Pete Rock
And since i got my advance
And i made a couple grand
I'll never stand there on that deep dot
I guess this life was made to be
I wasn't made for the world, it was made for me
Where everybody feel a nigga like they raping me
But imma be on by the next train home

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Pat Piff]
I'm MC so cozy
Household name like the furniture mane
Shouts to House Shoes and Dilla, all day
I spit crack nigga, i've been dealin' all day
Aye
Anybody can get it like minimum wage
So give me that mic let me get on the stage
Vibe with it if you feeling it, aye
If not you can skip it like some of the twelfth grade
Think i've been spittin' since maybe the sixth grade
Wishing these niggas would listen is my aim
Shit on the game like birds over stadiums
I'm a playboy
At the Palladium
People mover young Piff, no train
At been the same since i seen soul plane
Cause we all gotta leave someday
I pray that i miss like he got no aim
