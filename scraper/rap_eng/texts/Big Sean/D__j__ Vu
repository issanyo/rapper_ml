[Intro: Big Sean]
Straight up
Look

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Remember all the nights you used to fall through
Wondering why you don't fall through
All the late late nights I used to call you
Wondering why I don't call you
Think it's déjà vu
Cause I been here with you
I swear it's all déjà vu
Cause we been here, and we done this
Who run this, who run this

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I know you been working way too hard
And hardly get to play (I know)
Fell off in the sheets 
It feel like we ain't even skip a day
Whoa, it's been 3 years
I can't believe that shit, it's crazy
Where does the time go, you just had a baby
You had a new man, and you just separated
Back on the scene and you already faded
No shame in that girl, you need the escaping
I'm trying to recycle the time you've been wasting
You're drinking that Sean Don
I know that's your favorite, ha
No, but for real, how’s ya sister?
Hit her up, tell her I miss her
Oh she a Mrs.?
Y'all both dating NBA players, it figures
I guess with figures like y’all, ya'll need niggas with figures
That's figures on figures
Oh how the clique, bigger and bigger
Junior to seniors we upgraded
Come visit girl, fuck waiting
First class like 8am on that early flight
I will do girl, the best sex is still you
The best sex is still you

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Remember all the nights you used to fall through
Wondering why you don't fall through
All the late late nights I used to call you
Wondering why I don't call you
Think it's déjà vu
Cause I been here with you
I swear it's all déjà vu
Cause we been here, we done this
Who run this, who run this

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
I run this
I been fuckin around wit'cha
Playing with your emotions like I'm Chris Tucker on Friday
Do it my way with you
Cause I stuck around for ya
When your ass wasn't doing shit 
But running around the D
Wrapping nothing but the mother fucking swisher sweets
Tonight you gon' learn, it's your turn
All the shit you put me through
I'm a come through with that action
Then leave you on the mattress
Does it ever cross your mind?
You told me that you loved me
Then turn around and told your homies we was just fucking
Does it ever cross your mind?
You said, "Girl, I need ya"
Now you got amnesia, amnesia, amnesia

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Remember all the nights you used to fall through
Yes I do
Wondering why you don't fall through
All the late late nights I used to call you
Wondering why I don't call you
Think it’s déjà vu
Cause I been here with you
I swear it's all déjà vu
Cause we been here, we done this
Who run this, who run this

[Outro: Jhené Aiko]
You run this
You run it
You been running through my mind
You been running through my mind
All of the time, all of the time, all
Remember all the nights you used to fall through
Wondering why you don't fall through
All them late late nights
Wondering why
You don't fall through
Like you used to
