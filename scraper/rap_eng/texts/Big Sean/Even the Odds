[Chorus: Big Sean]
Bitch, this ain't no boss it's a boss up
Bitch, this ain't for sure, this a toss up
Bitch, this ain't Toyota, this European
Bitch she ain't no ho, she my girlfriend

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Bitch, this ain't is no nap, this how I sleep
Bitch, this ain't no hobby, this how I eat
Bitch, this ain't lust, so it's love
Bitch, this ain't the connect, this the plug
Bitch, this ain't beef, this is world war
Bitch, this ain't a show, this a world tour
Bitch, you don't know me, man, you know me
Bitch, this ain't the problem, this the solution
Feelin' like my chakras aligned
From now on call me Don
Rhymin' for days, I couldn't eat and it was not Ramadan
Niggas askin' for a cut, they just way out of line
Thugger

[Verse 2: Young Thug & Big Sean]
Ho, this ain't no Ford, this a Maserati
This is not a movie, baby, this a real dead body
I'm on a one-way street, 'bout to have a trolley
I fuck her one night then I'ma duck up out it
You do anything for this lil' bitch you might be a Cosby
Speakin' of Bill Cosby, I spike my drink with molly
You better not tell nobody, zip it, just zips and addy
Hit from the back, turn to a car when I'm backin' out it, yeah
Hit him with ten, fuck it, hammer gon' MAC his body
Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum dum-dum-dum
Hit 'em up like
Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum dum-dum
Hit 'em up like
Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum dum-dum
Yeah, I hit 'em up like
Dum-dum-dum-dum dum-dum

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Bitch, this ain't a boss, this a boss up
Bitch, this isn't for sure, this a toss up
Ho, this ain't Toyota, this European
Bitch, she ain't a ho, she's my girlfriend

[Verse 3: Big Sean & Gucci Mane]
Bitch, this ain't time, this is our time
Bitch, this ain't the plug, this the power line
Bitch this ain't Diesel, this Gucci (it's Gucci)
Bitch, you ain't know me, man you know me (yeah)
Bitch, this ain't Adidas, this Puma
Bitch, that ain't the truth, that's a rumor (yeah)
Bitch, you ain't my friend, you a tumor
Bitch, that ain't the new one, this newer
Bitch, this ain't fourth-quarter, it's crunch times
No foul lines, just front lines
Fuck takin' shit, boy, I just take what's mine
And I'm still hungry like a nigga was unsigned
Don't nobody want this shit more than I want mine
Fuck a free meal, boy, I'd rather go hunt mine
When you get the ball, boy, you be fumblin'
When you talk that shit, be mumblin'
Man, I got my one shot
Fucked around and and-one'd it
If the dogs ain't there then they one call from it, look
Run you out your house and now your ass apartment huntin'
From that Michigan cold, and I'm colder than that
Don't fuck with my crazy ass, boy
Your mama should've told you that
One way in and one way out
This life just like a cul-de-sac
The hood behind me like a cobra back
You quote the internet, I quote the facts
But snake niggas never tell the truth
You a liar
If you swear to God one more time on your life you might die

[Outro: Big Sean]
Real ones, I know you feel me
Independent women, know you feel me
If you self-made, then you feel me
Text from my girl, she said "Come feel me up"
Real dawgs, I know you feel me
My OG's, know they feel me, yeah
Bad bitch, she want to feel me
Text from my girl, she said "Come feel me up"
