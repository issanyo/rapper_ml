[Verse 1]
I'm about to go off on a tangent
Each line I write is a new love letter from Manson
Imagine me factoring out
The hate from this math equation
Me blowing up a hospital patient
I cause rotations and
I'm outstanding
Cuz this genre won't let me in
I stand out
But you back down (woah)
I don't mean you're back down as in you we're down before and got back up
I mean back up
It's for your best interest
Mans vicious
In this position, I was appointed
Call the damn bishop (oh!)
Hip-hop is mumbling
I'm done with it
These bloodsucking leaches
Only just end up cum guzzling (oh yeah)
Oh fuck it I'm juggling
These rhymes like tennis balls
As an up and coming artist
I find myself often functioning
Better under pressure or I'm a diamond cuz I'm just shining
But right now I'm in the rough
And I'm gonna go fucking sick (yeah)
Lamar Odom that Khloe shit
Tristan Thompson, I'm name dropping
No flame stopping
Get eight watches
Wetter than a three-point shot by Klay Thompson
Get the gauge cocked
Aim at your face
And make a fucking brain socket
Deranged stop it
The ladies watching
They'll think you're odd then
I'm more than odd bitch I'm outta pocket
I pick a line and do it like Apollo Robbins
Just that quick I picked your pocket
I took your watch and hope too
All while you wasn't watching (woah)
I may be crazy
Y'all too sane for me
Lately, I been debating if I should
Take 8 ladies by the braids and
Brazenly diss them repeatedly
And die cuz I shook em so fatally
Tenaciously pulling out all their anal beads
Fuck what they got to say
The devil came out to play
The wickedest rhymes displayed
Offend a mom when I hit a page
I must got a code to the safe
Don't compare me to a bitch liken me to Dr. Dre
Pure greatness amazing
Martin Scorsese
I'm a wolf
Wall Street journalist
Blood gurgling
Terms to get me in trouble with
Every authority figure
But a shit is not what I give a fuck, neither
I'm the second coming of Jesus like I'm just the one to succeed him
Bitch, I'm the GOAT ha! Sike this ain't even close
To my full potential
Elevate a mental
Meanwhile, their mental elevator been full
I mean a capacity tragically
You laugh at me
Then I'll decapitate your aunt Cassidy
Bitch, I'm pissed
Don't see an MC this
Evil distinguish
Me from the collection
My own section
The model you are is defective
No more repping you're ejected
I'm cutting you straight out this bitch like a C Section (yeah)

[Bridge]
It's simple really
Uncivil clearly
Why must they giggle queerly
Like I'm an official
And they are crippled
These lyrical extendos
A safety hazard the air outside my window
I'm just always an issue
You'd know if the devil had sent you
A mind I'm out that
Brain cells I might've lost that
Choke you with a hanger until your lights go black
Fuck it I'm Michael jack!
On fire
My final act
Involves me taking spinal axes
And Introduce them to ax season! (yeah!)
Wait did that even make sense
It could've
Might've just flew over your head
Like a Boeing 7 5 7
Or a fucking jumbo jet
Watch what you say to me
Or You might end up with karambit
Slicing your fucking neck


[Bridge 2]
So fuck the disrespect
This project is the next step
To me getting your last breath
And pissing bitch you're subject
To my immaculate stone cold verbosity
What I embody is great
You embody my ejaculate
Well fuck what the hell can they say to that
I may be black yup I'm dark
I love it
I'm your girls favorite type of coffee and honestly
She's always been all on me
Tryna get something out of me
My father would be so proud of me
Oh a hoe never that
Remember that
Method man blaring all in the system that
I don't have
I treat you like a coat rack
Throw shit on you
And you stay there for when I come back

[Verse 2]
Bitch I go spastic
On a track like a math wiz
I'm fantastic you're great that's sarcastic
Like I mastered
This shit
My vocab is
Off this earth like ET's vernacular
Sniper scope
When I die every mic gets cold
Cuz there's no one that can light it up like me no more
Like bitch don't fuck with a flow
That's about your level
Cuz even when the smoke settles
It'll be a hazard zone
I'm prone to being an uncontrolled animal
I'm so evil and amicable
You feel quite ambivalent
You can name me Hannibal
Lecter with scissors dissect you
Bicep rep flex to stick shit together flex seal
Matter of fact
The ones that can't rap
Are stupid they let all of that jewelry shit outta they traps
Like fuck it I'm mad
I'll take Gina Valentina
Into my sex arena
And teach her karma sutra
And put my subpoena in her bulimic throat
And feed her coke
I mean I hope
Well
That's what makes it so difficult after all
A fiend for the Adderall
My dreams have all involved
Me putting my penis on the cerebral of Lena Paul
Beginning her menopause
By sticking a meter long
Yardstick in her dark tent
With Forrest Gump in her tryna find his way out it
I never think about it
I just quick insult
Offenders and they kinfolk
Centered on they windows
In an orange coat
Rapping over this shit gave me sore throat
I teleported home so I can get my syringe for
The death choke


[Brdige 3]
Bitch, I present such a major risk
Like a PowerPoint
Get it?
They call me dangerous
I'm all alone and I'm floating
Above a ocean
Just coasting
With my homie Moses
To open it for me
I'm low key
A trophy
So lonely
Cuz nobody can  touch me
Cuz if they try they get burned
Meanwhile, I'm standing here soaking like


[Verse 3]
The water is frozen don't join me
Imma walk across it
Like em says he did with Beyonc√©
And Kanye in Africa
Wearing a Maga Hat
Or Nick Cannon with the Mariah Carey tat
Please don't get mad though
Cuz these are all just facts
Kendrick Lamar the lyrical god
Lyricisms dearly departed
I'll resurrect it for sure
With my 16 album
With three thousand hours put into it
Every rhythm is intimate
I could be spitting lyrics so infinite
I'm just penning these sentences
With my life form all up in it
Cuz no one can a stop menace
On a path where he's finally winning
Unlike his childhood spending
Every minute in his bedroom
Hoping he could make it in this music business!
