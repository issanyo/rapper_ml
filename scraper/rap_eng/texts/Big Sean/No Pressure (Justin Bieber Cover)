[Verse 1]
You ain't gotta answer none of my calls
I'm believing you'll pick up one day
I don't wanna add to your pain at all
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? Don't nobody deserve myself
Oh no, baby what I'm saying is

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
No rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
No rush, no pressure

[Verse 2]
Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'm a put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no one else
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
No rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
No rush, no pressure
