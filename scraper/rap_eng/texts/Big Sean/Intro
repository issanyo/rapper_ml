Yo, its TBO

IM LYRICALLY AND EMPIRICALLY GIFTED

IMMA SUPRISE YALL LIKE WHEN OJ GOT ACQUITTED

WHEN I BATTLE PEOPLE ITS JUST UNFAIR

I HOLD IT DOWN AND YALL ARE UNAWARE

I PUT MORE DAMAGE ON THE MIC THAT GAME DOES WITH 50

ALL MY SHIT IS REAL AND THATS NO MYSTERY

I WOULD KEEP GOING WITH THE RAP AND MAKE YOU LOOK EVEN WORSE

BUT I REALLY DONT FEEL LIKE CALLING IN A NURSE

SORRY KID, I REALLY WISH I COULD SAY I SEE YOU

BUT ONLY TIME I DO IS WHEN I PUT YOU IN THE I.C.U

I FREESTYLE FOR LIFE AND YOU BITCHES KNOW IT

I BREAK YA ASS APART BIT BY BIT

I FUCK YA GIRL AND I MAKE HER SCREAM

I MAKE HER SAY MY NAME EVEN IN HER DREAMS

I'M OUT THIS BITCH SO FUCK IT I'm DONE

YOU DON'T WANT NONE OF TBO SON!
