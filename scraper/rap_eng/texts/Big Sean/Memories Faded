[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
I got all these memories faded of you
With me being faded with you
I got all these memories faded of you
With me being faded with you
I got all these memories faded of you
With me being faded with you
Me being faded with you
Faded with you
You know I been gone like way too long
Tell me where you been it’s been way too long
Call me on the phone you taking way too long
Way too long I’m a stay alone

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Man lately I can’t lie I been drinking all alone
Remembering when your name was blinking on the phone
Back when we would chill Blue dream going off
Faded way too long on the dark after dark
You was taking off work I was taking off your bra
But you never played games you played your part
Plus you knew Granny, you knew the whole family
You covered all the bases like you knocked it out the park
Damn
Lately it’s been heavy on my mind you know
I feel like we ain't give each other time to grow
You know I’m on the grind I got a shine and glow
Even though you got a man that pussy’s mine for sho
So I’m gonna call you on my day off
And make sure that we stay off
But I’m gonna still put the work in
Then pretend like the email and cell phone ain't workin

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
I got all these memories faded of you
With me being faded with you
I got all these memories faded of  you
With me being faded with you
I got all these memories faded of you
With me being faded with you
Me being faded with you
Faded with you
You know I been gone like way too long
Tell me where you been it’s been way too long
Call me on the phone you taking way too long
Way too long I’m a stay alone

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
So I’m gonna call you on Wednesday
I’ll be over where your friends stay
And if you over there just know I’m going there
That bitch over there I hit her in the face
You know who I’m talking bout or naw?
I know it’s been awhile since we talked yeah
But remember all the times you used to fuck me in the car
Come right now and fuck me in the car
I know that’s really hard to say you know
Memories of us are getting way too old
I feel that you’ve been playing way too much
I been drinking way too much
I’m faded way too much

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
I got all these memories faded of you
With me being faded with you
I got all these memories faded of  you
With me being faded with you
I got all these memories faded of you
With me being faded with you
Me being faded with you
Faded with you

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Remember when I told your ass
Come quick, come through
Tell your friends to come too
Look, every time you come through drinks the only thing on chill
I had you in your feels before I even copped a feel
You go straight to the room like ooh you know the drill and
Just like my crib you’re looking better in the hills
And we get to blowing on that chemical plotting
We the young and cynical
And we got the vape blowing up
Bigger than a blimp will do
That pussy make me feel invincible
I mean how could you go
I mean why would you though
You know that year you said I lost my marbles
Well I guess I turned them all to marble floors
I just thought that you oughta know
Crossed the country when we split
Aroud the same time I had a low bitch come through
And do a split up on the dick
So nasty I even made her spit
Ugh
But you the only one I could commit to
Duh
I just really wanna know if you ever wonder though
Where did all the summers go
How did it get one below
Wishing you could come and not come and go
Come and go
Faded way too long, yeah
