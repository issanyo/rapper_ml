[Hook]
As I look into the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Mama it's ok your baby boy gone be alright
And living's better if it's life
La da da
As I look into the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Value every breath it till it all escapes my lungs
Let the good die young
La da da,La da da da, ohhh
As I look into the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die

Before I see the other side I suffer and coincide
My death with younger breath and hope for those alive
18 with a rap sheet never known to strive
When he get out swing harder down to his only strike
Bowling it's weird cuz he tryna dodge the pen
Instead of going for strikes he let the enemies win
Rolling will all my friends done taught to take a hit
Now my only fight is against my thoughts of just making it
Never said it was gone be easy believe me you're gonna struggle
You'll get so caught up in leisure you'll scream because no one loves you
The pressure of all the people around you when you are cuddled
The succubus kills your trust and lust begins causing trouble
Reflect back on the kid with a rap sheet I'm the same
Only difference wrote it myself, helps me to show the pain
I'm going toward the pen, ascending toward the fame
And I doubt that'll ever change
The nineties breeding a monster
My fam not eating I conquer
I sink my teeth in the lava
To spit hot speech at this concert
Lead my people to water, and hope I teach em to drink
You lost at C.H.A.O poke the dream watch it sink
Never feeling accomplished, writing a bucket list
Listening to all of my thoughts read my writtens beyond the crypt
If it is saga if it didn't exist
Let the truth be in audition exist only on the disc

[Hook]

I'm just an a town kid with nothing special about me
Doubt me throughout the years and my profession is cloudy
Alchemy made me big renovate the surroundings
I'm Malcolm verses the pigs they'd be better without me
Shouting CP songs on repeat till I only speak through ouljas
I'm Luigi Russolo make Art of Noise on every CD
And on TV, they can see me take a bow can never read me
Follow evil where's it leads me just to say veni vidi vici
Can a defeat be done peachy if a massacres involved
I left my challengers in atmospheres I'm NASA's one to call
Left my balance to an amateur and cash became dissolved
And if I have it then they had it too, I matched with all of ya'll
Naw I'm sick of tryna blend in with the norm
Uh I'm different I'm sitting in below the swarm
Uh I need a new approach to attack with the words I wrote
And be twice as deadly to those who doubted that I was a goat
Eloped to this music business with horace upon my back
With a knack of every rap cat go following in his tracks
But that's not me, 5 fingers of death I've been attacked by three
5 warlords suggest I could've matched Ali
3 fingers attack me middle, pointer finger ring
Point they fingers eff the world loves a lie another dream
Wanna live before I die I didn't need 100 things
As I look into the sky
