[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I just hit the errr up on the freeway
Switching lane to lane to lane speed racing
Swerve, swerve, swerve
I can't lie that ass is on my mind you know
I swear that pussy like that hard to find you know it's mine fo sho
Savor, let it savor
Drinking liquor, no chaser
Then I chase ya
Around the bed and then taste ya
I’m gon’ taste ya
Yeah I make the reservation then I give you D
D for dedication
Got that bomb pussy it just detonated
I’m your designated
Sex drive you to the destination
Lingerie my favorite decoration
I need Hennessy for that preparation
I hit the pussy with an exclamation I'm so spoiled
God damn you so loyal
Put you on camera that’s my favorite show
Girl I rushed here just to take it slow

[Chorus: Big Sean & Aiko]
I been working all night and now I need to hear you call my name

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I don't need nobody else
Oh you got me on the wave
Yearning for your loving baby
I need that shit everyday
Cause you know this ain't made for, for nobody but you you
You don't need nobody else
Is you trying to see me later
Sending pictures from my phone and flooding up your data base
Cause I don't be waiting for, for nobody but you
Ok my baby now look what you started
You got me laying straight back with my legs in the air while my back is still arching

[Bridge: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
Yeah I like how you talking but that talking better turn to action as soon as I walk in yeah
Watching you come is so easy but watching you go I swear it's the hardest
I want it the hardest

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
I been working all night now I need to hear you call my name
Where you at? On the way
How far? On the way
Pussy pop is on the way
How far we take it? All the way
Yeah yeah yeah

I been going all day and now I need to hear you say my name
Where you at? On the way
How far? On the way
Pussy popping on the way
How far we going? All the way
Yeah yeah yeah

[Outro: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
We stress
We grind
One time
Three times
You time
Me time
We time
We roll
Tree time
Rewind
Late night
Be mine
Yeah, and you know that's for sure
I clear the schedule so you know that's a go
Ok
We stress
We grind
One time
Three times
You time
Me time
We time
