[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yeah, this Virginia
Straight from the country, right there with my kinfolk
Golds in my mouth and they put 26's on Benzo's
Dirt roads, back woods, they got weed but I've been dope
Ratchet, nigga we act hood
But I'm getting money with these white folk
Sippin' and I'm faded, s-s-s-super medicated
Said she wanna check the pole, I said "Okay, Sarah Palin"
Yeah, yeah-yeah-y-y-y-yeah, so I lay down and lay in
A nigga gon' be faded, all the way to the AM, yeah

[Hook: Big Sean & Chris Brown]
Boi, damn, whoa, shit
Okay, more drink, po' it up, more weed, roll it up
Whoa there hoe, you know wassup (I'm high)
Quit hoggin' the blunt, bitch, slow down, pimps up, hoes down
Ass up, nose down, damn, bitch I do it (I'm high)
And this the life we chose
Workin' all night, swear I'm never going broke (I'm high)
Broke, and I'mma do this 'til I die
And I ain't talking shit just cause I'm, just cause I'm (I'm high)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Yup, whoa, boi, oh God, oh God
Okay, wow, bow, look at me now
Chief like a Indian, talkin' in clouds
I'm high as a bitch, I'm talkin' to clouds
Off tree every night like I roam with the owls
I super soak that hoe
Show 'em no love, just throw 'em a towel
Still rockin' Louis Vuitton condoms
Cause I'm so fuckin' in style, wow
New crib, crash that, drove here, cab back
Now knock that pussy out, yeah, that's just a little cat nap
Hold up, hold up, woah, don't be smokin' my shit
I be smoking that fire, she be smokin' my dick
Be smokin' my dick, little bitch

[Hook: Big Sean & Chris Brown]
Whoa, okay, okay, more drink, po' it up, more weed, roll it up
Whoa there hoe, you know wassup (I'm high)
Quit hoggin' the blunt, bitch, slow down, pimps up, hoes down
Ass up, nose down, damn, bitch I do it (I'm high)
And this the life we chose
Workin' all night, swear I'm never going broke (I'm high)
Broke, and I'mma do this 'til I die
And I ain't talking shit just cause I'm, just cause I'm (I'm high)

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Tahahahah, uhh
Smokin', chokin', always rollin' something
I don't need a key to start my car bitch
I just push a button, did a show and
Got a half a mil' and spent it like it's nothing, money flowing
Never sober, smoking 'til I got concussions, no discussion
Man I got a condo and got a big crib, pounds all over my kitchen is
If I ain't on the road gettin' it
Then I'm in the hood where my niggas live
Did a tour, sold it out, just bought a pound 'bout to finish it
Now all my pasta got shrimp in it, you talk about it, I'm living it
Fucking little bitch, hahahahah

[Hook: Big Sean & Chris Brown]
Boi, whoa, okay, more drink, po' it up, more weed, roll it up
Whoa there hoe, you know wassup (I'm high)
Quit hoggin' the blunt, bitch, slow down, pimps up, hoes down
Ass up, nose down, damn, bitch I do it (I'm high)
And this the life we chose
Workin' all night, swear I'm never going broke (I'm high)
Broke, and I'mma do this 'til I die
And I ain't talking shit just cause I'm, just cause I'm (I'm high)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Real nigga never frontin'
Cause when you got it all, everybody want somethin'
Middle finger in the air, no fist pump
And me, Sean and Wiz got this bitch jumping
Huh, finally got this bitch jumping
Got this bitch jumpin'
Fly, that's me, hahahah
