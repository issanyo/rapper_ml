[Verse 1: Rowlan]
See I remember back where I'm from, when I wasn't the man
They said a rapper from here, man sounds like a plan
They thought it was funny, I guess They thought I was playing
But now I'm out in LA, and you still hear what I'm saying
I'm speaking to that boy who's dealing hate
That got a mother that love him but got a fatherless fate
Got a sister who's out, and a brother in trouble
Rocking ripped smelly clothes, cause my mother would struggle
She worked two jobs, well kind of three and half
Single mother three kids, our stove would heat up the bath
I'm sure you get it, you get it, but you still weren't me
I used to witness things at home that made me with I would bleed
I tried to help mom, hey but your boyfriend is strong
I was just a little boy, grabbing a grown mans arm
I couldn't stop it, but I still tried every time
Please stop it, I swear I cried every time
I pick my mom up, he storms out, the truck spin rubber
I hold my mom as she cry and I tell her I love her
I felt pain deep inside, but mom this is life
Grab my hand, let's pray, hey God I need tonight

[Chorus: Rowlan]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

[Verse 2: Rowlan]
I search for the pain, I look for the dark
I write down my life, and try to light up a spark
I search for highs, I remember the lows
I write them down in my music, so you relate to my flows
I hope you learn
I hope you learn this life ain't perfect
But when you don't know your worth
I hope you know that you worth it
I see my dreams, hey mom the universe aligning
We waited for this moment mom its all about timing
I’m feeling blessed the metronome rides on the beat that I say
Heaven was the dream and we like 2 projects away
I see the peak of the mountain
I hope the mountain keeps growing
I’ll always be Tommy
Although they know me as Rowlan
I’m still your little boy, but I’m the man
I’m the one who drops the music for the fans
I’m still your little boy but I got a plan
That gets you lounging in jamaica in the sand
The truth can change quick and so can your people
I seen a couple sides of life and they all end up evil
I see the truth we take for granted, and I try to embrace it
This life ain't the same and I try so hard just to face it
But, I swear harder than it looks, harder than it looks, harder than it.....

[Chorus: Rowlan]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
