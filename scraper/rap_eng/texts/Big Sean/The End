Yeah
[verse 1 Donte ]
Life feeling like an outro X2
The way I'm feeling right now outgoing
Right now I'm feeling out going
(Trap Islands)

Growing up yeah growing up
Seeing some will hate you some will show you love
We making moves while they be holding up
Trying to never ever let my focus up

If my focus numb
Then I'll never know
Never know what the outcome is
Just producing things like the alchemist
With these dreams I'm trying to real life-ING it
Like dang

Right now I be Feeling like a physic kid
Tryna take dreams and add life to it
With the people around me I'm riding with

That last gen got hype to it
That 99 what i represent
Said my hellish soul is soo heaven sent
Cuz they will never know how well we did

How well we did? and we doing great
You straight ? Im straight we touche
We living but when you living life lucid life can seem like a movie

But the show is barley just starting
I was born dawg to be a martyr
I born dawg for all this [x]   2


Hook

They don't show love in this state
Regardless man I mixing the love and the hate
I got bros who all use the drugs for the fate
With the drugs in the safe
Like Bruh isn't safe

But man why he gotta do it
I wanna inspire them be fluent
I keep flowing like some fluids
I'd rather make mistakes than be stupid
And that's just 100

Man people gotta realize
Like logic this real life
I just wanna live real nice
Not soo much as fame but just living dawg how I wanna feel like

So I hustle hard like Kevin heart
Seeing HD my vision sharp
I be up up in the waves like a shark
But Im on point boy just like a dart
