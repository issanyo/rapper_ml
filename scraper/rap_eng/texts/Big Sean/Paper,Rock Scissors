Baby, girl, I think we need to
Sit and talk, talk, talk
Playing with my money
Paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock

Blowing up my heart
Just stick a pin and pop, pop, pop
Either you too bitter
Don't know what you got, got, got

I could be wrong, you could right
You probably be alone, I probably not
Well, listen, girl, you acting like an idiot
Really try to love you but it's getting hard, hard, hard

Is you crazy? Did you lose it?
Are you stupid? Are you foolish?
Girl, I'm the only one like me on the planet
It don't take rocket science to understand it

You paper, scissors, rock my world
Girl, am I the one you're playing?
You paper, scissors, rock my heart
And throw it all away

You throw it away, you throw it away
Th-th-throw it away, throw it away
Paper, scissors, rock my heart
And throw it all away

Well, I can take you back to the spot
Where you was bought, bought, bought
Make 'em [Incomprehensible] turn my
Paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock

Maybe you can think about the shit
And stop, stop, stop
Climb up on this boat and show me
How you jump, jump, jump

I could be wrong, you could right
You probably be alone, I probably not
Well, listen, girl, you acting like an idiot
Really try to love you but its getting hard, hard, hard

Is you crazy? Did you lose it?
Are you stupid? Are you foolish?
Girl, I'm the only one like me on the planet
It don't take rocket science to understand it

You paper, scissors, rock my world
Girl, am I the one you're playing?
You paper, scissors, rock my heart
And throw it all away

You throw it away, you throw it away
Th-th-throw it away, throw it away
Paper, scissors, rock my heart
And throw it all away

Okay, whoa, there, whoa, there
Is you noodle, cock-a-doodle
Are you crazy, crazy, crazy, bitch?
You knock a couple screws loose?

I know what time it is
Only 'cause you
I got bitches jumping for me
Like a bouquet by the beaucoup

Are you tryna leave, are, you trippin'? Tie your shoe lace
You's a dime, bitch 'cause you two faced
And you gave me heads and tails
Throw it at me, baby, I be the wishing well

For real though
I know our shits not perfect
We connected in our space
Where our love's written in cursive

Put that rock up on your finger
Paper in your hands
But you can't cut me out
Bitch this ain't no game

Is you crazy? Did you lose it?
Are you stupid? Are you foolish?
Girl, I'm the only one like me on the planet
It don't take rocket science to understand it

You paper, scissors, rock my world
Girl, am I the one you're playing?
You paper, scissors, rock my heart
And throw it all away

You throw it away, you throw it away
Th-th-throw it away, throw it away
Paper, scissors, rock my heart
And throw it all away
