[Verse 1: Big Sean]
You know I ain't having that shit
(Got you Bitch)
How could you be so selfish
Phone off, careless
You ain't drinking no more that's bullshit
I heard you're taking more shots than a full clip
No call, no text, huh?
That's how you feel when you stressed, huh?
You know I'm from a tribe called questions
I need them answers now like it's test time
Do you realize how many good girls I lost
When I changed the number for you
When I needed that peaceful sleep and still cuddled for you
You ain't even know when times got hard I bent up the budget
I kept it subtle
Might as well put jackets over the puddles for you
You’re acting irreplaceable, pfft, hardly
I shoulda took the warning signs on nights I hit you and you ain’t get back to me
The morning time, you got me on the borderline
I used to want to put the work in now I feel like overtime

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When I hit you late night, texting
Phone off, no stressing
How could you be so selfish, selfish, so selfish?
Phone off, no texting
No pics, no calls, no sexting
How could you be so selfish, selfish, so selfish?
I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it
So, so selfish

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
Why would you just play with the one
Who been there with you when no one would come
Can't believe I stayed faithful
To somebody so ungrateful
Don't you know there’s a line for my love?
And you be out here lying on us
Ain't that some shit?
Ain't that a bitch?
And you wonder why the past has changed us
Wonder why it ain't the same for us
You keep fuckin' up, it’s all on you
You just made it so hard for you

[Chorus: Big Sean, Jhené Aiko, Both]
Late night, texting
Phone off, no stressing
How could you be so selfish, selfish, selfish?
Phone off, texting
No pics, no calls, no sexting
How could you be so selfish, selfish, so selfish?
I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it
So, so selfish

[Outro: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Breakdown
I think it's time to break down
Late night, texting
Phone off, stressing
Testing me now
Stressing me out, out, out
How could you be so—
