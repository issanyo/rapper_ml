[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on, yeah

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh?
How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on, yeah

[Outro: Ariana Grande & Big Sean]
You, you, you, you
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
You, you, you, you
(Best mistake you ever had)
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
