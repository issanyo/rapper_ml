Don't ask me questions
And Come correct me if
You feel I'm talking reckless
I  ain't Just talking crazy
Yeah licensed to for my weapon
Well protected by them brothers
I ain't talking smith and Weston
You niggas been on my check list
And I'm coming wit da heat
Be prepared to start sweating
This not a road you wanna take
Peep the street signs
No accidents it's on purpose
When the streets mine
I knew one of these days you gon come up wit a weak line
And get killed in my first 6 seconds
RIP vine
Life's quick
Not to much time to blink about it
Who better the young God really think about it?
Stressed out ion think just drink about it
Know my time coming doe I get geeked about it
Out of touch ion care if you guys feel me
I'm a gardener ion care if you hoes dig me
From the gardens it ain't hard to find a hole to dig you in
Grim reaper rapper taking souls wit da pen
Ain't gotta interest playing yo side
Or both sides
Since ye high it's been bayside
Still ye high
Ion rap imma artist
But got the wordplay of a nigga
Out of college
Best at it
Way above average
24 years young
So I'm way above savage
Flow dope
Bars be like coke
Policitions sell dreams
And churches sell hope
I'm so woke
Had breakfast while you sound sleep
And we can take it to floor
Nigga ground beef
And ion wanna be the king don't crown me
So holy you gon have to gown me
And keep nun of the lame guys round me
This that circle that will hurt ya get it round me
I like a lot of y'all guys
But to me you all fries
And six pieces lemon pepper on the side
Fast food man I love snappers
That's my second favorite meal
Man I love rappers
Who want beef?
I need something to eat
Hold up let me pick the last
Nigga out my teeth
I keep my face out the drama
They sleeping on me so I gave them fuck niggas pajamas bayside
