[Verse 1]
Hop on that dick like a maniac
Head like a brainiac
Gotta read the sign like a zodiac
I'm a lowkey freak, you don't know me yet
Good head got a lil' bite to it
Little booty got a lil' bounce to it
We can go all damn night to it
Wife that, gon' throw rice to it

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh why, oh why I wait too long?
Oh his **** is way too long
I think I can take it all
Oh why, oh why you actin' scared?
Pull that pull up like a chair
Know you see me over here

[Chorus]
Have you ever fucked with a maniac, maniac?
You just made love to a maniac, maniac

[Verse 2]
I must, I must, I must, I
Must admit I'm in love with your sex
Every single day, baby give me your best
Every single day, you be gettin' this neck
Never gettin' no rest, just took two breaths (ahh, ahh)
Need a vacay
Nigga shot more rounds than a AK
Goin' 'round 'round 'round like a 8 8
Never showin' up late for the late late

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh why, oh why I wait too long?
Oh his **** is way too long
I think I can take it all
Oh why, oh why you actin' scared?
Pull that pull up like a chair
Know you see me over here

[Chorus]
Have you ever fucked with a maniac, maniac?
You just made love to a maniac, maniac
Do you wanna fuck with a maniac?
With a maniac (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Make you fall in love with a maniac (with a maniac)

[Verse 3]
I stay up all night for ya, I'm a trooper
Call and request, I pick up, pull up quick as Uber
Anywhere, everywhere, you turn me to addict
If you love me like you say you do then get it tatted
Do you, do you, do you, I know how to do you
Flip me over then maneuver
As long as a ruler, you the ruler
Don't tell nobody else, that's the rule, yeah
Ass in the air, feet in the air
Weed in the air, we in the mirror, me and you stare
Night shift take the stress away
Then the second round take the rest away

[Chorus]
Have you ever fucked with a maniac, maniac?
(Have you ever... loved with a maniac, baby)
You just made love to a maniac, maniac
(You just made love to a maniac)
Do you wanna fuck with a maniac?
(Do you wanna... fuck with a... maniac, maniac)
Make you fall in love with a maniac, maniac
(Make you fall in love)

[Outro]
You just fucked around
You just fucked around
You just fucked around
With a maniac, ma-ma-maniac
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
I'm a maniac
I'm a mothafuckin' maniac
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who love this pussy? You love this pussy
Who love this pussy? You love this pussy
You can't get enough of this pussy
I know that you like it, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
