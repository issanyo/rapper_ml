[Verse 1]
These are the moments in time that we've been waiting our whole life to find
That we've been searching for all through the night
Just tell me that we'll be alright
'cause, baby, in a world of cancer (ayy)
Where everyone needs a ransom (ayy)
My mama said "love is the answer" (ayy)
So when i call you better answer me
Right now i need you here on me
No substitutes, you're the one and only
Please take away the stress i don't need
You got me on my knees, baby, james brown, please
The time is ours, not for borrow
Both got a past full of sorrow
Let's cancel everything tomorrow

[Chorus]
I always get caught in the moment
With you, with you
With you, with you (caught in the moment)
With you, with you
I always get caught in the moment
With you, with you
With you, with you
With you, with you
I always get caught in the..

[Verse 2]
You showed me what it's like to depend on somebody
And never need another body giving that guidance
Lighting this heavy darkness inside us
See the future that might be us
Sever my heart in seven parts
Not trying to make you my crutch
My horcrux, you're light blue, a monsoon
Spinning my heart oh so fatal
Eyes glow hazel
Love no label
Ever faithful
Never painful
Only grateful
You disable me

'cause, baby, in a room full of dancers
You still are the answer
These other hoes nothing to focus on
I need somebody real to get close up on
Looking for someone who don't annoy you when they overstaying
It's looking like i am like one a.m
Could put you to sleep faster than melatonin
Us zoning, wishing i could freeze-frame the moment

[Chorus]
With you, with you
With you, with you (caught in the moment)
With you, with you
I get caught in the moment
With you, with you
With you, with you
With you, with you
I always get caught in the moment

[Outro]
Ayy
Yeah
Listen.. (ayy)
I dream of you often (ayy)
A nightmare i find myself lost in
A wandering wayfarer forgotten
In this night terror
You are a dream i wish hadn't come true
I always knew what you and i would always amount to
You're a mistake that i wish i could undo
I left everyone and now i'm left with a heart broken into (in two)
