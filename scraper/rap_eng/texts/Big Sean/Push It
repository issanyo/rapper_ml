[Intro: Big Sean & Both]
Ain't no other nigga hitting my bitch
Nobody else can stop me
I’m gonna take you inside, outside, inside, outside, inside
Let’s keep it inside

[Verse 1: Jhenè Aiko]
On the sink
On the couch
On the bed
On the floor
On the porch
On the stove
On the road
Touch my toes
Out of breath, take it slow
I wanna feel it in my soul
Yeah, I know you love it when I'm on top
Gotta keep it going baby, don’t stop
I’m gonna give my all to you
While taking all of you

[Chorus: Jhenè Aiko & Big Sean]
I want it outside inside
I take you inside outside
Bring your outside inside

[Bridge: Jhenè Aiko]
I think I can see my life in your eyes
I think you got everything that I like
I think I can feel you coming inside
And at the same time

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
You got that head going
You got the silk on
You got that high-heels looking like you got stilts on
This the foundation our love was built on
Bend you on the sink there in the restroom that’s the wet room, that’s the best room
Got'chu tweaking like you off a mushroom
Clothes everywhere like it’s the dressing room
Where’s the next room at
Go ahead and take the rest off
You put that dress on for me tonight like it’s the Met Ball
Cancel all your other plans off
I’m gonna play this Johnny Gil, Vandross and Sade, and Goapele
And you gon use that mouth to take these pants off

[Chorus: Jhenè Aiko & Big Sean]
I want it outside inside
I take you inside outside
Bring your outside inside

[Outro: Jhenè Aiko]
I think I can see my life with your eyes
I think you got everything that I like
I think I can feel you coming inside
And at the same time
Alright, alright
