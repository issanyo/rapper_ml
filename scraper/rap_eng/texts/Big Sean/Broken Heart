[Hook: A$AP Serg, Big Sean, & Jhene Aiko]
When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes
Tear what we had right apart
Ooo, I was so mad
I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware beware beware
Of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 1: A$AP Serg]
Once you're in you can never go back
Friend zone hurts like anxiety attacks
First one to text but you never get replies
How long will it take before you'll finally realize
Writing this song in the corner of my room
Swept up my feelings like a Spanish broom
Some nights I wish I didn't think about you
Got me saying right now, "What am I suppose to do?"
You're so cocky thinking you can have it all
But I'll be there when it's time for you to fall
Gotta admit you're the prettiest I've seen
We're about the same age almost turning eighteen
Too bad I know that I got no chance
It would've been nice to have a prom dance
With you that moment would have to be the greatest
I just need the perfect girl to fulfill my engagement

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A$AP Serg]
The person you love is going through the most
What will it take for us to really come close
Ludacris is right you're imperfectly perfect
You're so amazing got the butterfly effect
But wait this song doesn't have a happy ending
Even though right now I'm just tryna be the next thing
My love game sucks always getting backstabbed
It didn't take long for you to really get attached
We went to the fair and it didn't really work out
She took it too far don't know what that was about
Curved so hard can I ever get a break?
It really gets tiring like the Instagram rates
She's so crazy how far can she fall
She's always chillin at the Jacksonville Mall
You say you're a Christian when we know what you do
Church selfies who you trying to fool?
Hypocritical what can you prove
If you try you know you're really gonna lose
Twerking so hard tryna be like Miley Cyrus
Gone too far she got an STD virus

[Hook: A$AP Serg, Big Sean, & Jhene Aiko]
When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes
Tear what we had right apart
Ooo, I was so mad
I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware beware beware
Of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 3]
Deep in my feelings it's the worst thing ever
You're right JB never ever say never
Kobe going off posterizing on Dwight
Like J Cole she got me up all night
A million choices but I only want one
But I hate to say it that you're gone baby gone
You're the best stuff on Earth you can be my snapple
New Years Eve can we visit Big Apple?
Love is a game that we always want to play
But it never really lasts I can never make you stay
Who am I kiddin this will never be easy
Getting real stupid can you help me Lil Weezy
IOS7 got the power of blocking numbers
Erasing you forever and the thought keeps getting number
The 910 mixtape is such a good start
Was never good enough to heal a broken heart

[Hook]

[Outro 2X: Jhene Aiko & A$AP Serg]
Baby
Last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy
Crazy, Crazy
