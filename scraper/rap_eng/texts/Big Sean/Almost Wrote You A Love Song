[Intro - Suai]
Tried to write a love song
I wanted it to be just right
Tried to make it beautiful
But all I could think of was our last fight
I was going to play it on piano
Have the drums come in real bold
But I couldn't think of anything good to say
So the big ballad strings will never get played
Pretty melody I wrote will never get sanged
Piece of paper I started with I thrown away
A song about our love will never see the light of day
Why, cause you made it that way
You made it that way
I was gonna write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
Playing games now you just
A lame who's shit outta luck, crazy ass bitch
I almost wrote you a love song

[Verse 1 - Big Sean]
She threw my watch out the window
Chain in her hand
She running through the crib finding anything she can
Our relationship is not the only thing thats outta hand
She even called my mama like you need to get your man
Cause your son lying on me, I ain't trying to get a tan
And this the last time he'll have me crying in my hands
So I'm heading to the club tr-tr-try and find a man
Bitch you headed to the club tr-tr-trying to find a man
What is you saying had hoes and passionate night gowns
But you the only one I imagine in white gowns
So where ya left hand you should let me add a ring to it
Because mr & ms anderson just has a ring to it
She like why you act like that to me and walk right back Mike Jack to me
Every time we fall out I'll throw yo ass out
But you just end up boomeranging right back to me
What the fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Big Sean]
I think you crazy, crazy, you need medication
You should calm down, you need meditation
Sending me a text with a hundred exclamations
About how I'm wrong without any explanation
At all before you say another nigga next up
I should call a maid down cause I messed up
But gave you what you need even on them shopping sprees
I would throw you paper like extra extra (read all about it)
She said what if we reversed roles
And you was front row cheering at my first shows
And a couple dollars later and some Louis Vuitton clothes
I could fuck a couple niggas thinking that you wouldn't know
And since I had no feelings for them then it shouldn't hurt yours
And since you thought I'd never do it it even hurt more
And I would lie about it and you'll find out from the source
Whose word was more truthful then yours
What would you do

[Suai]
And I was so glad I didn't ever pen it
Now you ain't got nothing with your stupid name in it
And if I would've did it would've probably stay with ya
Listening to the lies you were constantly telling you did me all wrong
What would even make me wanna write you a song
So glad I moved on
Cause now I got a new guy thats turning me on
And the big ballad strings are about to get played
Pretty melody I wrote is about to get sanged
A song about our love is going to see the light of day
Why?
Cause you made it that way
Oohhh yeah you made it that way
Ohhhh oh yeahh I was going to write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
Playing games now you're just
A lame who's shit outta luck
I almost wrote you a love song
