[Verse]
Here here we go from Japan to Romeo
My flow is slow and it's you know my first time on radio
Now some say I'm foul, some say I'm wild
And that all might be true
But it did not happen overnight
So let me tell my tale to you
It started out when I was six just telling dirty jokes
My mother overheard and washed my mouth out with soap
Now as I grew I always knew what it was for me to do
Never front just be blunt and always tell the truth
Never fake, I never act like something that I'm not
Remember me I'm that foul mouthed kid that lived around your block
You thought that I was crazy like a dog chasing it's tail
And by the time I turned of legal age I'd probably be in jail
In school my teachers thought I was just a foul mouthed freak
Now their yearly salary is what I make in just one week
So to the people who used to say u think u know it all
Maybe I do and maybe I don't but right now I'm standing tall...
And you don't know me

It's funny how one kid can because so much confusion
Parents should be happy I'm the dop their kids are using
Now some people think this business is all fame and glory
But there's a flip side to that truth so let me kick my story
It took me oh so long to reach the point I'm at
Every time I take one step forward they push me two steps back
I give an inch they take a mile some try to cramp my style
They try to diss they shoot they miss
I walk off with a smile
But time will pass and I'll out last anyone who doubts me
And the booty naked truth is u don't know shit about me
So when I'm in your town to nearest mic please kindly show me
So u can see what's really me and find out you don't know me
Because you don't know me
Now you might want to party man so here's your party jam
Hey girly in that skirt I want ya just like Uncle Sam
Let's knock boots, let's knock boots right down to the nitty gritty
With every drink and every blink you seem to get more pretty
So out the bar straight to my car now what's left to do
She was saying I love u so I said yeah I love you to
(Ha!)
Next day I awoke I almost choked
Who's bringing me inside
My head was ringing heard people singing "here comes the bride"
Thinking just what was I drinking as I looked around to see
The girl I met last night was at the alter waiting on me
Next thing I know I'm face to face with holy matrimony
Looked at that bitch and I quick screaming
You don't know me... She didn't know me

Girls around this country think I'm nasty think I'm sexist
But they bought my first L.P
U know-Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast
Saying ooh your this and oh your that uh uh uh hold up cutie
What's your favorite song off that L.P
"Ah, Wax that Booty"
A lesson taught, I know you thought my dirty raps were kinda funny
But close minded people thought I was only out to make money
But check on back because it's a fact obscenity is no new thing
Remember Chuck Berry and when he sang My Ding A Ling
But for me I feel what I see and I say just what I feel
And in this world everything I see you know is all too real
Even though I don't look the same because I cut off my flat top
I'll always say just what I feel because that's the real Kid Rock...
And you don't know me
