I wanna go back

I wanna go back

Uh cause I remember way back when

Got kicked out the crib and had a place to stay

In the Clem with some friends George and Jay

It was a funky fresh crew and I'd DJ

What a shock it was to be on the set

Comin from a nice home now livin in the projects

No regrets cause I learned alot

And I earned alot in the parking lot

Doin dirt for the O.G's slangin rock

They used to call me that little white kid

Who could rock on the two turntables

And that ain't no fable

Watchin Eddie Murphy instead of Clark Gable

My whole life style switched Hoss

Puttin in hours at the 76 car wash

But I could never wait for them weekends to come

Dum ditty dum ditty ditty dum dum

Boom, boom, the bass went

On turntables fuckin it up in Duke's basement

Groove time productions, we kept the jam jumpin

Open up your ears Im tryin to tell you somethin

And give some love back to those that loved me

206 Court street and my second mom Tracy

Little Keesha and Cole

My mellow blow, and my homegirl Flo

Rock round see, you could find me some

But I kept my tables in the crib when I wasn't in the club

Tom Whit and Mike Shafer used to give me rides

And buy me groceries when I didn't have no paper

And I'm grateful for this

Sometimes I look back and it's these times I miss

Making demos on my old four track



Sometimes I can't help but think, I Wanna Go Back

I Wanna Go Back...back in the time

I Wanna Go Back

I Wanna Go Back...go way back way back y'all

I Wanna Go Back...back in the time



I got kicked out again for bein fly

Got invited to stay with Tony and Eli

And they treated me like brothers

R-I-P to their cool ass mother

An my brother din dada

For the homies ain't here I still gotta lot of love

I wanna go back, way back

And change things and bring y'all back

I'm pourin beer out for y'all

I'm singin I saw the light from my cousin Paul

Life brings alot of tragedy

I look around at times and its so sad to see

A wasted life, or a broken home

But all I can do is take care of my own

I feel so alone like a stranger

And sometimes I express my love through my anger

And I lost alot of friends for this

Blackman, T-Bone, Ernest KDC, and Chris

And the rest of the Beast crew

I ain't sayin that I'm wrong, but I still got love for you

Cause I remember how it used to be

Make way motherfuckers beast crew's in the party

To the right, to the left

Many black men and Funk Daddy Def Stef

And sometimes I feel blessed for sure

To a been a part of one of raps last great tours

Ice Cube, Too Short, D-Nice, yo yo

Kid Rock and it dont stop



I Wanna Go Back...back in the time

I Wanna Go Back

I Wanna Go Back...go way back way back y'all

I Wanna Go Back...back in the time



I remember litte Robert, cause I stayed with him

I used ta go and see Campbell, when I need a trim

And when times got grim and seen that I lost my way

I used to get blown of with Reve

Bumpin' shoulders and slappin' hands

Willie Knight had a disco, right in his basement man

Them New Haven jams

Me and Blackman running crazy scams

Not a black or white thing, a wrong or right thing

Just makin' that money, and pullin them honies

Spandex shorts and the halter tops

Slanging them rocks and runnin from the cops

The only white kid walkin round on the block

Cruisin in Amp's low ridin ragtop

Go see Howard for what ya need

Underage buyin forties and bags of weed

Late night liquor from Bubba Coles

People used to say, Rock you got soul

Vince looked out and so did Lou

Had a studio budget from the cocaine loot

Chuck D and Murph were the original three

And now Richard D and Kracker are down with me

I got a studio record and a taste of fame

But when I roll throught the Clem it's all the same

Even though things change, you know I ain't forgot

Cause the love from the past gave birth to Kid Rock

But it's hard to go back to the things I knew

Cause tha me life a have now lives for two



Yeah, and that's where I'm at

I Wanna Go Back...back in the time

And that's where I'm at

I Wanna Go Back...go way back way back y'all

I Wanna Go Back...back in the time

Bring it down

Wayyyyy

Heyyyyyy

Let it ride, let it ride

Heyyyy...Heyyyy

Way back, way back y'all
