Hahaha
You took my friends away, yea
You got them livin for the grave
Now everythings been fine since you've been gone
But you made my winters feel so warm

I'm livin for the soul that ain't been mourned

You played my soul for your fuckin fools
Got down and I'm leavein

You took my life and you turned it around
But you made my winters feel so warm
You got me livin for the soul that ain't been mourned

But cho makin me feel this way
I can't live everytime, this ain't my grave
But you got time to break on me
Some never know I been found yet

YEAAAAAAA
You're makin' me feel this way
I guess I'm livin everytime, this ain't my grave
But you got time to break on me
Some never know I've been found
