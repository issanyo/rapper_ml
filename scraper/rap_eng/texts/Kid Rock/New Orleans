[Verse]
Come on
I'm going down to New Orleans to see about a friend of mine
I'm going down to New Orleans and leaving all of this behind
Heading south from Detroit
I got Cajun cooking on my mind
When I get to New Orleans someone gonna treat me right
Yeah in a town like New Orleans someone gonna treat me right
I'll be high 10 Rolling till the early morning break daylight

[Bridge]
A jambalaya and a crawfish pie going to start my day
But when the sun goes down we going "bon temps roulez"
Hey

[Chorus 1]
I'm going down to New Orleans to see about a friend of mine
I'm going down to New Orleans where the stars on the sidewalk shine
Burning through Mississippi with the Big Easy on my mind

[Chorus 2]
When I get to New Orleans someone going to threat me right
Yeah in a town like New Orleans someone gonna threat me right
And I'm going to party like the devil if the Neville brothers play tonight

[Bridge]
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie going to make my day
Down on the Bayou singing Hey Pocky Way

[Chorus 1][x2]
I'm going down to New Orleans to see about a friend of mine
Down in New Orleans good peoples they's hard to find
I bet he's making gumbo and drinking homemade wine
A jukebox shaking and breaking down in New Orleans
I'll be the highest hillbilly that Bourbon Street has ever seen
Oh yeah, yeah

[Chorus 1]
I'm going down to New Orleans to see about a friend of mine
I'm going down to New Orleans and leaving all of this behind
If the good Lord's willing and the rivers don't start to rise

[Chorus 2]
And when I get to New Orleans someone's going to treat me right
Said in a town like New Orleans someone going to treat me right
All the cats in the cradle going to rock this kid tonight
Oh hey

[Bridge]
A jukebox shaking and breaking down in New Orleans
And if you're paying for fun a french quarters really all you need

[Outro]
I'm going Down to New Orleans
Down to New Orleans
[Repeat]
Going down, down
Down, down tonight
[Repeat]
