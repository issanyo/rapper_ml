They used to call me names, said I was just a wanna be
But now they all pay to see what they were getting free
How bout them days and now you don't know what to say
Ain't it funny how the sun can shine and then hide away

And it's a long way on a they say highway, I'm still runnin'
A lonesome freeway of uncut my way, can you feel me comin'
A tombstone ugly, and if you judge me, better watch for me comin'
In a fifty-nine drop top blood red cadillac

Knock knockin', black Bob at your door
Still rockin', everybody say that
Knock knockin', black Bobby at your door
Knock knockin', looking for a payback

They used to say Ritchie boy, he got no sense
But now they say oh Bobby man, he was my best friend
Ain't it funny how the glory and the stories and the times can change
And no sense Ritchie just bought himself a big fucking airplane

And it's a long way on a they say highway, I'm still runnin'
A lonesome freeway of uncut my way, can you feel me comin'
A tombstone ugly, and if you judge me, better watch for me comin'
In a fifty-nine drop top blood red cadillac

Knock knockin', black Bob at your door
Still rockin', everybody say that
Knock knockin', black Bobby at your door
Knock knockin', looking for a payback

I grew up in the back woords, I hung in the crack hoods
I learned to pimp like a mack should
I could have been a rich man like pops
I never kissed ass and those days since passed
Here I stand like Jesus
I don't need this, fuck you ho's can squeeze this
I can't believe this, I'm so wasted
From all the fruits of life that I've tasted
Never a clone on the microphone
I got shit built up cause I never felt loved at home
And all alone's how I spent my free time
Writin' freak rhymes and drinkin' cheap wine
Easy whips and a cracker
I'm the master blaster, no one cuts faster
The king of disaster is who I am ho
And I'll be rippin' the fuckin' rhymes
And I'll make your mother shit her pants bro
So, so, you better watch your back
Watch for me comin', watch for me comin'
In a fifty-nine drop top blood red cadillac

Knock knockin', black Bob at your door
Still rockin', everybody say that
Knock knockin', black Bobby at your door
Knock knockin', looking for a payback
