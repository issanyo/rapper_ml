[Verse 1]
Back in the mother fucking saddle
My six shooter strapped and I'm looking for a battle
Out on the plains I'm just a loner
My saddle horn rubs right and yo it's giving me a boner
I got thoughts of Annie Oakley
But that buck toothed tramp in that last town she broke me
And we didn't even fuck
I gave my last gold tooth and gold nugget to get my dick sucked
3 days out on the frontier
And I'd kill for a cheap whore and a barrel of cold beer
I need a slut for a service
I take a peak at the ship and they all run away nervous
Man I got ta get my rocks off
Because my Wranglers don't fit right unless my cock's soft
Long nights by the fire me a Trigger.....go figure

I'm a desperate rado
Didn't take any practice
A desperate rado
Got a cock like a cactus

[Verse 2]
Now I drift through the desert like a wild coyote
Horny as a toad tripping off peyote
Holding up trains and getting goods by the sack
I'm known through out the west as the pie eyed mack
And to the law I'm no stranger
I'm wanted dead or alive because I shot the Lone Ranger
And then Tonto tried to get down
So I boned his bitch slit hes throat and then I skipped town
That's the way I run my show
Paint towns red
Fuck hoes and then I lay low
I know you think I'm archaic
But my dick's like a sword
I see pussy and want to slay it
Out on the plains it gets linely
Sometimes I feel homely
New faces
New towns no one knows me
Guns cocked in my holster
U see my face in each town nailed to a pole on a poster
I'm always lookin for the quick buck
Then always blowin my cash on a bitch with a big butt
Some say my head's hollow
Fuck em....I'm just a

Desperate rado
Trotting through the bad lands
A desperate rado
Toking down with all the cowhands
A desperate rado
Didn't take much practice
A desperate rado
Got a cock like a cactus

[Verse 3]
Now I fuck whores by the scores up ten fold on any fellow
In any town I can be found at the local bordello
Never yellow never chicken listen for my spurs dragging
And when I'm kicking dust you better circle up the wagons
So when I rip through your town don't be gawking
Just tip your hat and Tex keep walking
Because I'm a gun slinging top hand
Fuck with me and you'll go out like Custer at his last stand
I'm a low down buckaroo
If you leave me alone with your mother then I'll fuck her too
Because I'm a sidewinding nomad
And morals in upbringing is something that I never had
Known as the ruff ridin Texan
A bad buck from the day of my inception
And I was raised in the poor house
My mother kicked me out so she could start a whore house
Now since the day I left the corral
I've been on a quest for the plant that's called mescal
Because pale rider once pulled me aside
And told me that high was the best way to ride...

Now I'm a desperate rado
Always lookin for a fight
A desperate rado
Puffing on a peace pipe
I'm a desperate rado
On the run from the law
A desperate rado baddest one you ever saw
