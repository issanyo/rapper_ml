[Verse 1]
I can’t sing like Marvin Gaye, no
I can’t play that grand piano
I never was at the top of my class
I never threw no touchdown pass
All I got is cut glass to stand on
Cuz I never planned on getting my hands on
No kind of cash or a woman like you
That could last the whole life through
But now that you’re here, it seems so clear

[Verse 2]
Now I ain’t got no southern mansion
And I ain’t much good at slow dancing
I never swam the English Channel
And people they say I’m hard to handle
'Cause I’m like a candle in the wind
But where you end is where I begin
And I never win 'cause I’m good at losing
And thank the Lord I’m good at choosing
'Cause now that you’re here, it seems so clear

[Hook]
When the lights go down and the music plays
I feel like a king that could sing for days
I know sometimes that we don’t always agree
They scream for more and the more I give
It takes a toll on the way we live
Please forgive me baby and try and see
Yeah try and see
Please try and see
That you get the best of me

[Verse 3]
Now I didn’t make no reservations
And I didn’t plan no great vacation
Cuz I’ve been chasing rain drops falling
Running from love when it keeps calling
And I know you think I’m just playing the field
But let me show you girl what’s real
Cuz I’m all in like a crazy gambler
And though I don’t have all the answers
Now that you’re here, it seems so clear

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro]
Best of me
Best of me
You get the best of me
Best of me
Best of me
You get the best of me
You get the best of me
