[Verse 1]
Said I'm a pimp, you can check my stats
Roll in a Fleetwood, that’s how I mack
I rock all the tracks, so the world knows
I love all the girls, smack all the (hoes)
Show love to those who come real with it
Life's a bitch, but I deal with it
I'm in it to win it like Yzerman
Could drink about 15 Heinekens
I’m not born again, but if I was
I'd ask to come back with a little more love
Puffin' a Winston, drinkin' a Four-O
Kid Rock, and I'ma let you know

[Chorus]
I've been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin’, smokin’, thinkin', tryin’ to free my mind
I've been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin’, smokin', tryin' to free my mind

[Verse 2]
It's been a couple of months in this smokey room
Eating shrooms, drinking Boone's, writing tunes
Hoping to get one of these motherfucking songs to hit
A little bit of love that's all I need
Inspiration and a bag of weed
A seed to plant so my tree can grow
I left my girl, cause I don't need that hooold up
Wait a minute I'm about to flow
Like a breeze through the trees you can watch me blow
Puffin' a Winston, pluckin' a banjo
Kid Rock and I'ma let you know

[Chorus]
I've been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', thinkin', tryin' to free my mind
I've been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', tryin' to free my mind

Now, put your hands up
Let's ride, just put your hands up
Ride ride, now keep the hands up
Let's ride, come on uh uh

[Verse 3]
I ain't no rough guy, ain't no tough guy
Don't get out much and don't dress up fly
A pawn in the game is all I am
Givin' all my Ducats to Uncle Sam
I'm free to do what I please, little lady
I was born at night, but not last night baby
I've been around, seen some things
Slept in dumpsters, got high with kings
I don't bring much, ain't gotta lot to say
I got more time than Morris Day
Puffin' a Winston, takin' it real slow
Kid Rock and I'ma let you know

[Chorus]
I've been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', thinkin', tryin' to free my mind
I've been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', tryin' to free my mind

[Outro]
I've been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', tryin' to free my mind
I've been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', tryin' to free my mind
I've been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', tryin' to free my mind
I've been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', tryin' to free my mind
