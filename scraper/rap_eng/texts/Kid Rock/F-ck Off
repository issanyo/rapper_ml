A shimmy shimmy cocoa cocoa pu- pu - fucking puffs bitch
It's the K-K-Kid Rock with the K-K-Kid Rock shit
I'm on top bitch and rock for tricks
Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips

I get all the money pussy falls like rain
Been gettin' laid and paid that's why I never complain
If I ain't in it for the money, I'm in it for the P
It's 1998 yo and you still can't fuck with me

You don't be fucking with the blue eye
Fucking with my 2-5 hope your fucking ass like my shoe size
I got a new vibe, kinda like voodoo
You do what we say and we'll do what we want to

We're fucking up your city and we're fucking up your program
Fucking all your bitches we don't fucking give a god damn
Twisted Brown gets down with no assistance
We won't quit until we're banned from existence

Persistence pays if that holds true
Then I'm a buy this fucking planet before the time I'm through
I was praised and raised on the thoughts of no faking
So I'm gonna get what I got coming and the rest I'm taking

I'm shaking like Jerry Lee Lewis and shit
You act like a motherfucker's new at this shit
But I've been true to this shit given my heart and soul
Been shining like a diamond but gettin' passed as coal

So fuck off
Yeah

With my pants half hanging off my ass and shit
Bowl filled with hash pockets stuffed with cash
I be the mushroom trippin sippin shots of Jack
'Cause the kids don't listen gettin lots of flack

I be the do wa diddy up and down you block and
The ten karat Kid with my triggers cocking
The K the I the D R O C K motherfucker and you still don't know me
So blow me bitch I don't rock for cancer

I rock for the cash and the topless dancers
Don't have no answers so pass the joint
I'm just paid in full and made in Detroit
I ride like Senna in the Indy five

And get live with that which get's me high
Strive for perfection this much is true
We do what we say you say what we do
Kid Rock I couldn't be no Bozo

And I get too much P to ever be no homo
Rock from So Ho to Arizona
I'm an easy rider dreaming of Wynonna
I roam the country like a Greyhound bus

Put faith in lust and in God I trust
I'm not Peter Pan I don't fuck with fairies
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries
And Harry Carey couldn't call my game

Fucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame
And I show no shame from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag, but I like to boast

Fuck Off

Yeah right in your mother fucking ass bitch
With that Detroit city shit ain't shit switched We're on the same script
Nothing new since 76 Kid Rock
Yo Slim Shady come break these mother fuckers off

Yo tell the world to hold their breath they're breathing the wrong air
This planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair
Two white boys who spike punch and light joints
Hang around drugs loud music and like noise

Slim Shady and Brown Trucker another bunch of mother fuckers
Who hate the world as much as each other
And I ain't leaving this party tonight
'Til I see some naked bitches dancing around drunk touching each other

Rum and Pepsi got your perception of me sketchy
'Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me
'Cause all I do is curse and fuck
So when I do shrooms you all better give me two rooms

'Cause I'm fucking the first one up
So when you see me on your block you better lock your cars
'Cause you know I'm losing it when I'm rappin to rock guitars
This is for children who break rules

People that straight fool
And ever single teenager that hates school

Fuck Off
