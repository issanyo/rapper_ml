[Verse 1]
I remember waiting for the school bus
Jenny Clayton was my first crush
And neither one of us had a clue
An old Cheyenne it was my first truck
Rusted, rough and kinda beat up
But when she jumped in it felt brand new

[Pre-Hook]
And now these days when I drive through a small town
I turn my stereo up and roll my windows down

[Hook]
’Cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those days that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time

Just to love you again

[Verse 2]
I remember drinking from the same cup
We’d break up just to make up
I remember falling in love with you
Smokin’ cigarettes on the tailgate
Man it seems like it was yesterday
When Main Street felt like Park Avenue

[Pre-Hook 2]
And when I’m driving through any ol’ small town
I turn my stereo up and roll my windows down

[Hook]
’Cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those times that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time

[Bridge]
When forever felt like it would never come
And we never thought we’d turn 21
So young we thought this could never end
Oh how I wish we could go back again

[Verse 3]
And now that time has taken over
And we can’t fight this getting older
But somehow baby we made it through
And every time I’m a lookin’ at you

[Hook]
’Cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those days that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time

[Outro]
Just to love you again
Just to love you again
Just to love you again
Just to love you again
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time
