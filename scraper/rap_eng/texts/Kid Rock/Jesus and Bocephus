[Verse 1]
Sometimes I’ve had too much to drink
Get all stoned and play some Hank
I guess that’s just the way I am
And I love the man from Galilee
Because he died for you and me
I met them both in Dixieland

[Hook]
'Cause I got Jesus and Bocephus
They both help me to live my life
I went from Jim Beam to my Bible
With Jesus and Bocephus right there by my side

[Verse 2]
When the water all turned into wine
I lost my mind for a time
I felt them both holding my hand
And lookin’ through these blood shot eyes
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
Two sets of footprints in the sand

[Hook]
'Cause I got Jesus and Bocephus
They both help me to live my life
I went from Jim Beam to my Bible
With Jesus and Bocephus right here by my side

[Bridge]
I was cashin’ in, I was castin’ stones
I was lost in sin, I was on my own
Now I don’t feel alone

[Hook]
'Cause I got Jesus and Bocephus
They both help me to live my life
I went from Jim Beam to my Bible
With Jesus and Bocephus right here by my side

[Outro]
With Jesus and Bocephus right here
Right here until the day I die
With Jesus and Bocephus
