Yeah, turn me up in the headphones

Been a lot of cheap talk but I rock still
From the streets of Shanghai back to Knoxville
Sittin' high on a mountain top
Holdin' shop, spreadin' the good news

Been a lot of false prophets and quick hits
And a lot of un-American bullshit
But the time has come to settle
And the devil's gonna make you choose

And just like a cold wind blowin'
Can you feel me comin' for you
Just like a freight train rollin'
Packed tight, full of rhythm and blues

Testify, it is a rock revival
Don't need a suit, you don't need a bible
Get up and dance
I'm gonna set you free, yeah, testify

It's all sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
A soul sensation that you can't control
And you can see I practice what I preach
I'm your rock 'n' roll Jesus, yes, I am

Been a lot of bling, bling but it ain't real
And a lot of new kings but I won't kneel
Sittin' high on a mountain top
Holdin' shop, singin' the raw dog blues

Like in old Mississippi's dirty cotton fields
Or in Detroit City's unforgotten wheels
It's the same song spinning
But the same song's always been true

And I'm gonna take my roll
'Cause I ain't got nothin' to lose
And I'm gonna save your soul
If it's really what you want me to do

Testify, it is a rock revival
Don't need a suit, you don't need a bible
Get up and dance
I'm gonna set you free, yeah, testify

It's all sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
A soul sensation that you can't control
And you can see I practice what I preach
I'm your rock 'n' roll Jesus, Jesus

Come on
Get on your knees

Testify, it is a rock revival
Don't need a suit, you don't need a bible
Get up and dance
I'm gonna set you free, yeah

It's all sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
A soul sensation that you can't control
And you can see I practice what I preach
I'm your rock 'n' roll Jesus

Testify, it is a rock revival
Testify, it is a rock revival
Get up and dance
I'm gonna set you free, yeah, testify

It's all sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
A soul sensation that you can't control
And you can see I practice what I preach
I'm your rock 'n' roll Jesus
