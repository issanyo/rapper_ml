I like the French braids in your hair
And them faded blue jeans that you wear
I like to watch you shoot your guns
And I like the way you love having fun, oh baby

I like the way you turn me on (turn me on baby)
Just like an old Keith Whitley song
I like the way you shake it, work it (work it baby)
Ten out of ten baby you’re perfect (oh you're perfect baby)

You know the sun is shining on Kentucky (on Kentucky)
They’re drinking bourbon by the batch (by the batch baby)
I walk that line because you love me (cause you love me)
And I wanna be your Johnny Cash, Johnny Cash

I like the way you hold my hand (hold my hand)
And play just like my baby grand
I like how you don’t give a damn (don’t give a damn)
And love me just the way I am, the way I am

You know the sun is shining on Kentucky (on Kentucky)
They're drinking bourbon by the batch (by the batch)
I walk that line because you love me (love me baby)
And I wanna be your Johnny Cash, Johnny Cash

And lay you down in that blue grass

That certain smile, hey girl you own it (own it baby)
Come lay your head here next to mine (next to mine)
You know I cherish every moment (every single moment)
And I love you till the end of time, end of time, end of time, end of time yeah

You know the sun is shining on Kentucky (shining baby)
They’re drinking bourbon by the batch (by the batch)
I walk that line because you love me
And I wanna be your Johnny Cash, Johnny Cash

Sun is shining on Kentucky
They’re drinking bourbon by the batch (by the batch)
I walk that line because you love me
And I wanna be your Johnny Cash, Johnny Cash (Johnny Cash)

And lay you down in that blue grass (lay you down in that blue grass)
And lay you down in that blue grass (I wanna be your Johnny Cash)
And lay you down in that blue grass (lay you down)

Your Johnny Cash
