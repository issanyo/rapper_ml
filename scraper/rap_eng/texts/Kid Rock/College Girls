[Verse 1]
Spring break at Lake Havasu
She matriculates at ASU
In a tanktop and daisy dukes
She's nineteen, nintey-proof

[Refrain]
Why can't they all be college girls?

[Verse 2]
Seattle Art Institute
She's got Bettie Page bangs and a new tattoo
She loves to paint and plays the flute
She wants to have rendezvous

[Refrain]
Why can't they all be college girls?
(C-O-L-L-E-G-E girls)
Why can't they all be college girls?

[Verse 3]
From Texas up to Michigan
They'll let you think they're innocent
Licorice sweet, like cinnamon
Damn, you wish you were a kid again

[Verse 4]
Oregon beaver orange
In just a jersey and shorts on her sorority's porch
In the middle of a Northwest storm
[?] keep a cowboy warm

[Refrain]
Why can't they all be college girls?
(C-O-L-L-E-G-E girls)
Why can't they all be college girls?

(This one goes out to my alma mater: University of Nevada - Reno Wolfpack, baby)

[Verse 5]
She pays tuition at UNR
In dollar bills, ain't got a debit card
She shakes her ass 'til she passes the bar
She loves to dance but she has to charge

[Refrain]
Why can't they all be college girls?
(C-O-L-L-E-G-E girls)
Why can't they all be college girls?
(C-O-L-L-E-G-E girls)
Why can't they all be college girls?
