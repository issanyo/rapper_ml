[Verse 1]
I’m leaving town this morning
Back on a midnight ride
No destination weary
Caught in the same old stride
And oh my lord I’ll see you
Ruined by the way
Only to remember
The sideways sins of yesterday
Summertime in Denver
Going to see some friends of mine
I may hide there ‘til September
Fore the leaves begin to die
It don’t even matter
The poets seldom heard
I’m going to board the midnight ferry
And carry on my way with yes the world

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, hey[x4]

[Verse 2]
Touching down in Memphis
Going to find some blue suede shoes
And even though it may seem senseless
It’s all that I can do
It don’t even matter
The preachers seldom heard
I’m going to board the midnight ferry
And carry on my way with yes the world

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And it’s my last trip through Detroit
Going to drown away this pain
I got no one left to live for
And no one left to blame
It don’t even matter
I don’t want the last word
I’m going to board the midnight ferry
And carry on my way with yes the world
I’m going to board the midnight ferry
And carry on my way with yes the world

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
It don’t even matter
I don’t want the last word
I’m going to board the midnight ferry
And carry on my way with yes the world
I’m going to board the midnight ferry
And carry on my way with yes the world
I’m going to board the midnight ferry
And carry on my way with yes the world
