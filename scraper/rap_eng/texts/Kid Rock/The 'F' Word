[Verse 1]
Well I've been hanging out with my Rebel son Kid Rock
And I don't really like this stuff they call Hip Hop
But he's sure been good to me
And I'm still trying to make him see
In country music, you just can't say the F word
My son Shelton say he's been having a hard time
Yea he does great shows but he's just got to speak his own mind
Well I wonder where that came from?
I guess he's a real son-of-gun
Take the old man's advice, be nice, and lose the F word

[Chorus]
No, no in country music you just can't say the F word
Oh we've come a long way but it's best if that one's not heard
Oh we've had some hells and damns
But we don't say "bitch" we say, "why yes ma'am."
Cause in country music you just don't use the F word

[Verse 2]
Today's hot new country, it sounds pretty good to me
But it's time for basics, our roots and some reality
You got to scrape me off the ceiling
Mrs. Hawkins says it with feeling
But in country music you just can't say the F word

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Some of these guys say it 500 times
But in country music you don't use it one damn line
Oh in country music we don't say the F word
