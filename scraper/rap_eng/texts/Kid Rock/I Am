[Verse 1]
Well fire it up
Chop one out
Somebody's got to know
That i'm two days in
I got two days left to go
Cause i'am Georgia
I am Memphis Tennessee
I am everything
Hollywood wants to be
I'am love and i'am hate
I'm your late night drunk debate
But you'll never put
Your finger on me

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen the sun
Over the rocky mountains shining
Or touched the sands
Of a southern Florida beach
Have you seen a grown man cry
Or a child that's slowly dying
Have you looked inside
To see all that you can see
And i'am north and south Dakota
And new York city
I'am everything Hollywood wants
To be
I am love an i am hate
And all the critics can debate
But they will never put a finger
On me
No you'll never put a finger on

Have you seen the northern falls
Or the mid-west seasons changing
A Montana storm
Or a warm Kentucky rain
Have you heard the love that sings
Over the inner city sidewalks
Have you risen above
All that leads to hate

[Verse 3]
And i am Boston and d.c
And all of Detroit city
I am everything
That Hollywood wants to be
I am southern rock-n-roll
Country and hip hop soul
And you'll never put a finger on me
I'm a father and and i'm a friend
I'm your brother till the end
But you'll never put your finger on me
I am only God knows why
Ill be a cowboy till i die
But you'll never put you
Finger on me
You'll never put your finger on me
You'll never put[X2]
Put your finger on me
