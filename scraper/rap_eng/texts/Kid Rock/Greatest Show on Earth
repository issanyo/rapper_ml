[Intro]
Is everybody ready?
Kid Rock is in Auburn Hills tonight
Alright, everybody stand up
Everybody stand up
Detroit, are you ready to get crazy up in here?
Say Hell Yeah!
Detroit say Yeah!
Play something these motherfuckers can understand

[Verse 1]
I’m a pour it out
A big block 4x4
I'm a billboard
A buckshot that can't be ignored
I'm a drift store
I was built to invade
I'm the realest motherfucker and I'm coming with age
I'm rib-cage
Broke down, battered, and bruised
I was space age
Cowboy shooting the moon
I'm a full blown
Down home rolling stone
I'm a cyclone
I'll shit wherever I roam

[Chorus]
Welcome to the greatest
Love you when you hate us
Welcome to the greatest fuckin' show on earth
Welcome to the greatest
Love you when you hate us
Welcome to the greatest fuckin' show on earth

[Verse 2]
I'm a full blown
Freak show somethin’ to see
Got'em lined up
And waiting taking bullets from me
I'm a Mack truck
I'm trucking down a one-way street
You better move bitch
My fuck tank's on E
Baby come and see me shine
I'm a mountain
Of fame, the last of my kind
Don't test me, oppress me
Arrest me or fine me
You best bring it on me if you're dying to try me

[Chorus]
Welcome to the greatest
Love you when you hate us
Welcome to the greatest fuckin' show on earth
Welcome to the greatest
Love you when you hate us
Welcome to the greatest fuckin' show on earth
Welcome to the greatest
Love you when you hate us
Welcome to the greatest fuckin' show on earth
Welcome to the greatest
Love you when you hate us
Welcome to the greatest fuckin' show on earth

[Bridge]
Welcome to the greatest
Love you when you hate us
Welcome to the greatest fuckin' show on earth

[Chorus]
Welcome to the greatest
Love you when you hate us
Welcome to the greatest fuckin' show on earth
Welcome to the greatest
Love you when you hate us
Welcome to the greatest fuckin' show on earth
