[Verse 1]
Hey now darling, you thought it was all fun and games
Running around, telling everyone why we're not together
I guess you just had to feel important
And I'm sure you thought I was just going to sit back and take it on the chin
But honey, I'm a songwriter
And that darling is where you end and this song begins

[Chorus]
I found someone new who treats me better
She don't bitch about things we haven't got
When I sing this tune it don't upset her
She's half your age and twice as hot

[Verse 2]
Oh she wakes up every morning and she folds my clothes
Doesn't care about the strippers dancing at my shows
She knows that I love her so I just wanted you to know

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
Oh she don't start trouble because she don't need drama
She likes it in the morning and she loves my momma
I'm her big poppa an she's my little rock and roll

[Chorus]

[Outro]
She's half your age and twice as hot[x2]
