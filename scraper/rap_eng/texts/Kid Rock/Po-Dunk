[Verse 1]
Momma looking good in some jeans all ripped
Got a baby in her belly and a baby on her hip
Little toe headed rascal peeing off the porch
Daddy got a shotgun looking for a stork
Oh lord

[Chorus]
And that's po-dunk
Don't give a flying hillbilly fuck
I said po-dunk
House full of youngins and a yard full of junk
Love us if you can, sorry if you can't
Holla if you is, shut up if you ain't
Po-o-o-o, Po-Dunk!

[Verse 2]
Bible by the bed and a bottle sitting pretty
Pigskin on the TV, bacon in a skillet
An ol' mutt in the yard lickin' on an itch
Bunch of fake flamingos flocking by the ditch
(Can I get a witness?!)

[Chorus]
And that's po-dunk
Don't give a flying hillbilly fuck
I said po-dunk
A yard full of chickens and a farm full of drunks
Love us if you can, sorry if you can't
Holla if you is, shut up if you ain't
Po-o-o-o, Po-Dunk!

[Bridge]
Po-dunk

[Verse 3]
Put your adult beverage over your head
If you're bat shit crazy and your neck is red
As the dirt on the road where we all grew up
Sing something with me if you ain't nothing but...
(You ain't nothing but, you ain't nothing but, you ain't nothing but)

[Chorus]
Po-dunk
Don't give a flying hillbilly fuck
I said po-dunk
House full of youngins and a yard full of junk
Love us if you can, sorry if you can't
Holla if you is, shut up if you ain't
Po-o-o-o, Po-Dunk!
Po-o-o-o, Po-Dunk!
Po-Dunk!
Po-Dunk!
Po-Dunk!
