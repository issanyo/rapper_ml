[Verse 1]
I been known to fight the good fight
I been known to walk alone
I been known to stay out all night
Drinking wine and getting stoned

[Chorus]
I feel like you’re not ever going to let me love you
I feel like I’m going to be left here on my own
I feel like I’m not ever going to rise above you
I feel like we will always walk alone

[Verse 2]
I was born into the good life
I have owned a wretched soul
I was thrown into the dark night
Where I roamed with no control

[Chorus][x2]
