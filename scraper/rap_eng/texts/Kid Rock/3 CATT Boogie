[Verse 1]
I’m hitting heavy, I’m swinging low
Slow and steady, I don’t know
Who can go the distance when karma comes gunning for you?
You can say what you want baby, but there aren’t nothing we can do

[Chorus]
Now the preacher man’s yelling that Book of Revelation
And Uncle Sam’s selling us a one-world nation
Banks hedging bets for the next generation
And all while building us a big space station

[Verse 2]
I bought a Chevy in Idaho
Hey where I’m headed, I don’t know
But my existence is a glorified story of the truth
They can talk all they want baby, but that’s all they ever do

[Chorus]
Now the preacher man’s yelling that Book of Revelation
And Uncle Sam’s selling us a one-world nation
Banks hedging bets for the next generation
And Wall Street’s stirring up the whole situation

[Verse 3]
So come and catch me, if you can
Maybe Egypt or Iran
Starting revolutions baby, hey that’s what I do
You can be who you want momma, but it’s better being you

[Chorus]
Now the preacher man’s yelling that Book of Revelation
And Uncle Sam’s selling us a one-world nation
Banks hedging bets for the next generation
And Bobby’s upset because there aren’t nothing changing
There aren’t nothing changing
