[Verse 1]
I got my Cat Scratch Fever eight-track
My best friend's in a gun rack
I'm a lowlife
I owe everybody money
I think racist jokes are funny
I'm a lowlife
I got a dirty mind, a gutter mouth
I'm making time, I'm going out
With your wife

[Chorus]
Because I'm a lowlife
I'm a lowlife

[Verse 2]
I got kids I never seen
And their momma's seventeen
I'm a lowlife
I take strippers out to breakfast
You can add that to my checklist
I'm a lowlife
Ahh the landlord called the rent is due
I spent it all on a Kiss tattoo
I Rock n Roll all night

[Chorus]
Because I'm a lowlife
I'm a lowlife
I'm a lowlife
Living the highlife

[Verse 3]
I'm watching porno on the TV
Wondering why she'd ever leave me
I'm a lowlife
The object of my affection
Asked the police for protection
I'm a lowlife
The romance is gone, I'm doing fine
Me and your mom had a real good time
Just last night

[Chorus]
Because I'm a lowlife
I'm a lowlife

[Verse 4]
I make black music for the white man
Keep cocaine upon my nightstand
I'm a lowlife
Isn't never hung out in the Catskills
But I've been to jail in Nashville
I'm a lowlife
I've got a dirty mind, a gutter mouth
I'm making time, I'm going out
With your wife

[Chorus]
I'm a lowlife
I'm a lowlife
I'm a lowlife
Living the highlife
