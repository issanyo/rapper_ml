That's right motherfuckers, I'm back
(This is the true story about mackin'...check it)
Times are changin'
(Talk about it)
More so each year
But the Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp is here
(Yeah)
So let it rain, and let the guitar rock
And if you hear me yawn
(Then just drop that top)
Come on, girl
Hey, hey, hey
(Well, well, well, well)
Hey, hey, hey
(Well, well, well, well, well...come on)

(Verse 1)
And I be catchin' them Northern Pike
Like on a ten pound test
Success, never fess, take a guess
I be the Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp
Straight limpin'
Boone's Farm drinkin'
At the party big booty pinchin'
Chillin' like a villian, balloon fillin'
Wack MC killin', the fine ho drillin'
With the million dollar talent and the ten cent brain
Been gone too long, too much cocaine
But now that I'm back, on the block
I'm ready to rock
Left to right all night
My game's tight, I wish you might
Take a bite out of this here toxic, melodic
Neurotic product, fresh from the harvest
Who'll be the largest, hardest, smartest label in town
Top Dog, get down, uhh
Radio won't play me
But still I got the kids around the world goin' Kid Rock crazy
And wicked witches be flyin' on broomsticks
Kid Rock be comin' with the boom, boom, boom, biatch
I from the sticks, biatch
Straight from the RO
"Kid Rock I ain'ts no bitch"
Uh, yes you are ho
So quit frontin' like you don't know
When I step straight into the party with my homeboy Tino
"What's up?"
Get a good look bro
Get a good gander
I'm made in Detroit
But my name ain't Stanzler
Spreadin' like a cancer, a virus
While you're lookin' really gay like fuckin' Billy Ray Cyrus, huh
I'm the highest MC of all time
Got my mind on the D
And the D on my mind
And the line gets drawn when my eyes can't see
Hit me twice with the 'Tussin and the morphine IV
I be, what they call an OG, bitch
I'm the motherfuckin' Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp

Now throw your hands in the air and let's rock y'all
Just throw your hands up high, hip hop y'all
Just throw your hands in the air and let's rock y'all
Because a Detroit party don't stop y'all

Just throw your hands up high, let's rock y'all
Just throw your hands side to side, hip hop y'all
Just throw your hands up high, let's rock y'all
Because a Kid Rock party don't stop y'all

(Verse 2)
Now I'm the self made mack on a mountain of moss
Got the money green Cutty with the high pro gloss
A Lincoln Continental and a Grand Marquis
Rag top dropped down, rollin' on chrome D's bitch
The purple furs and the gold trim glasses
I only bust the fat asses
And I don't be givin' a fuck who the hell can rap better than me
Cause I'm a true fuckin' player and a mack like a real G
H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P is for pimpin'
Early mornin' stoned pimpin'
I been down, been around
From the bottom to the top
Partyin' down with the slimmies in the cities that I rock
So uh, ooh baby, baby, baby let me love ya
Or if you wanna get your freak on, I'll just fuck ya
With the ooh, ahh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, bitch
Shit, I'm the Early Morning Stoned Pimp
Hey hey hey
Come on y'all

Now throw your hands in the air and let's rock y'all
Just throw your hands up high, hip hop y'all
Just throw your hands in the air and let's rock y'all
Because a Detroit party don't stop y'all

Just throw your hands up high, let's rock y'all
Just throw your hands side to side, hip hop y'all
Just throw your hands up high, let's rock y'all
Because a Kid Rock party don't stop y'all

(Verse 3:  Tino)
My name is Tino, you know
Baby let's get funky
I'm like Lenny Bruce, girl
But I ain't no god damn junkie
Cruising with the Kid in my '71
To the crib of love, gonna get us some
Ladies, we keep 'em on a stringer
Midgets in the house want to smell my finger
Coming for you baby, cause you're so suburban
How do you like me now in my brand new turban
I'm a natural born hoodlum like George Raft
One of these days you kids will pay for my autograph
So groove baby, groove baby, call your mama
I'm like John Lee Hooker, girl

I got the boogie drama
With the boogie drama
With the boogie drama
With the boogie drama

Ridin' around the neighborhood
Me and Kid Rock were up to no good
With the boogie drama
With your leather miniskirt and we got some wine
Playin' the radio ya look so fine
With the boogie drama
Well, Well, Well, baby
With the boogie drama
Let's get funky, that's my job
Punchin' 9 to 5, 7 times, times 24, times 12
Day in and day out
Let's get funky
Come on everybody
With the boogie drama
With the boogie drama
With the boogie drama
