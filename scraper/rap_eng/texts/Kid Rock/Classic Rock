[Verse]
Well guess who's back, with a big fat cock
It's the Kid motherfucker with the Classic Rock
Like Wax That Booty, yodeleyeho, punk
Slapping you hoes with Dick when I get drunk
From Alabama, to Texacana
Bend over bitch and let me slam a
Big fat dick up in your puddy, oh goody
If your a freaky ho, well do the backdoor boody
Bitch
Don't need your front
You'de shit your pants if I licked your cunt
Fucking in the bed, fucking in the showers
I got more hoes then my man Ed Powers
I won't send flowers after fucking doll
You can bet your ass I'll be screening calls
I don't really need to be tied down
I'm a rambling man and I'm platinum bound
A hound on the hunt ripping hoes apart
And I fuck so hard I make the pussy fart
Do the hip-hip-hop yep it don't stop
I'm back, bitch, with the Classic Rock



Now if you wanna be fucked then step up, bitch
I'm gonna pack my dick all up in your shit
Now I don't like rubbers, they hold me back
Instead I roll like Tonto and ride bare back
I won't cut slack for the stuck up hoes
Hear my rhymes turn up their nose
See me on the strip, try to tell me I'm sick
That's when I drop my drawers and show em my dick
Huh, you know that's true
I got a pocket full of pills and a bottle of brew
Got a ho named Sue and one named Pam
Fucked em both at the same time[?]Goddamn
Playing shows, fucking hoes
Got the dope in my veins and up my nose
I want some hoes I can mack on
Kid Rock, ya know I get more pussy then a tampon
Kid, to the clip, to the grip, to the flip
Stood back, to the slap, to my nuts in your butt
Yeah don't stop, because I'm back with the Classic Rock
You put my balls in your mouth, and you don't stop
You put my balls in your mouth
