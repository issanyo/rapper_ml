[Chorus]
I wonder if you think of me
The way I think of you
The secrets that we share
Everything we used to do
Without a care, so wild and free
I wonder if you think of me

[Verse 1]
I wonder if I'm on your mind
The way that you're on mine
This record's skipping in my head
The hands of fate and time
Please show me a sign
I wonder if I'm on your mind
And baby I can't stand this loneliness
When nights are dark and cold
And this addiction I've been dealing with
Is tearing up my soul

[Verse 2]
I wonder just what could have been
If we'd have made it through
Would we have a family
A castle with a view
And can we still be friends
I wonder who's been loving you
And darling I can't stand the pain
This emptiness inside
I feel I'm bout to go insane
Without you by my side

[Outro Chorus]
I wonder if you think of me
The way I think of you
The secrets that we share
Everything we used to do
There's no one here to comfort me
I wonder if you think of me
There's no one here to comfort me
I wonder if you think of me
There's no one here to stand by me
I wonder if you think of me
