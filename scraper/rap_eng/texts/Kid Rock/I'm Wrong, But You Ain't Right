[Verse 1]
Breaking the silence is the hardest thing in life
Knowing that you're wrong, feeling like you can't go on
I've been a victim so many times
But I'm man enough to know when I'm wrong

With the fresh cut mullets, back row in sight
Pass the packed bullet, I'm gonna rock all night
Uptight right wingers, tryin' to say I'm what
But I'm a flight bound singer not giving a fuck
Hard luck of the devil with the grace of God
On a level of Oz, and it makes you nod
With the body of a sinner, mind of a saint
I'm everything you love, everything you hate
Hit a lot of curves, hard roads and hills
Got nerves of steel, and watched time stand still
It took too long, but I stood my height
You can say I'm wrong, but you ain't right

[Chorus]
You aren't right, you, you, you ain't right
You aren't right, right
You aren't, you aren't, you aren't, right
You aren't, you aren't, you aren't, right
You aren't, you aren't, you aren't, right

[Verse 2]
You can save the environment with all your wit
But can you save your children from a world of bullshit
You look at me with a loss for love
But if you took me out would your kid still do drugs
You want to point your finger in the unclear
You want to point your finger in the unclear
You want to point your finger in the unclear
You ought to point your finger in the mirror
You want to trip, quit, because I'm a keep ripping
You can bitch but the strippers going to keep stripping
I'm singing songs in the key of life
And you can say I'm wrong but you aren't right

[Chorus]
You aren't right, you, you, you aren't right
You aren't right

We just came to get on down and rock
Rock on
Cowboy baby, cowboy baby

[Chorus][x2]
