[Verse 1]
There's a place I can't go back to anymore
My life is different now that's for sure
You took all my sun away
And now the sky is turning grey
It's a whole new world since you walked out the door

[Chorus]
It's been raining whiskey, pour a beer
There's a thundering jukebox in my ear
I feel a great depression coming on
It's been raining whiskey since you've been gone

[Verse 2]
Now the mirror shows just what a fool I am
Cause behind the bottle sits a sad and lonely man
There's a chance that he might drown
In all the heartache that's coming down
It sure ain't turning out the way he planned

[Chorus]
It's been raining whiskey, pour a beer
There's a thundering jukebox in my ear
I feel a great depression coming on
It's been raining whiskey since you've been gone

[Bridge]
If I had a chance with you
One more time (One more time)
I'd be sheltered in your arms
Wrapped up in the sunshine

[Outro Chorus]
It's been raining whiskey, pour a beer
There's a thundering jukebox in my ear
I feel a great depression coming on
It's been raining whiskey since you've been gone
(Since you've been gone)
It's been raining whiskey since you've been gone
Raining whiskey since you've been gone
