Kid Rock, I got the sex rhymes
Kid Rock, I got the sex rhymes
Kid Rock, I got the sex rhymes
All world class

[Verse 1]
Kid Rock, motherfucker, no, I isn't no [fag]
Fuck bitches dry, fuck them on the rag
Tag their toes, check off my list
Hoes get fucked, they don't get kissed
A simplistic pimp, getting much respect
I'll fuck your mouth and leave your ass in debt

Jet set the country on the world purse
Just to show you how a real pimp works
Remove your shirt, show me them titties
I'll drive my dick right through your twin cities
Around your bends, over your curves and ass
Park it in your mouth till I run out of gas

[Hook 1]
Snoop Dogg, I got the sex rhymes, say what
Snoop Dogg, I got the sex rhymes, what you say
Snoop Dogg, I got the sex rhymes, say what
All world class, well

[Verse 2]
It isn't nothing like black pussy on my dick
Word to your momma and your sister, bitch
I play hoes like a motherfucking football game
I pull my dick out and then say it's good y'all came
Y'all did your thing, worked a nigga from front to back
In the Bill Clinton presidential cadillac
We smoked a sack, the bitches couldn't handle that
Blew out my brains and left no stain
I can't complain, shit, it's all done with game
I fucked so many hoes, I can't remember their names
But it isn't about that, bitch, I really doubt that
Just turn the lights out and put my dick where your mouth at

[Hook 1]
Kid Rock, I got the sex rhymes
(Kid Rock, you got the sex rhymes)
Snoop, I got the presidential sex rhymes
(My nigga, my nigga, my nigga, haha)

[Verse 3]
I'm on a private jet out of J-F-K
Sipping a vex, feeling a-o-k
Looked across the aisle and who did I see
Bill motherfucking Clinton sitting next to me
We kicked it, talked, had a couple of laughs
The stewardess walked up, asked us for our autographs
I thought I was mack and I gave her two free shirts
Bill stuck five fingers up in her skirt
So I stuck five, and that made ten
Shit, two roosters and only one hen
Billy winked at me, it was all too sweet
We tag-teamed that freak at thirty-thousand feet, haha

Yeah, thirty-thousand motherfucking feet flying high, ooh
Kid Rock and [George motherfuckin' Bush]
And we thought we does it the most in the coast
Shit, we got the sex rhymes, hold it, hold it
Let me see if you got some gangsta shit, homey
Cause if you do, I'm a kick something for you
A little something like this

*Beat changes*

Oh shit, some gangsta shit
All I need is a gangsta bitch
Because gangsta shit is all I kick
I fucks with a black, brown or a white chick
Bitch you can act like you aren't with the shit
I'm here to strip a bitch, and cold pimp a bitch
Looking for love in all the wrong places
Looking for love, fuck love, it's two races
Smoking it up in too many places
Busting a nut in too many bitches faces

Well, I'm Kid Rock, got pussy galore
You might get a lot of pussy, I gets much more
Got scores of whores, and macks know what's up
'You's a player', nope, I'm a flat-out slut
Got what you came for, yes indeed

Ecstasy and a sea of weed
Got a seed to plant in a field of crack
I wear my cowboy hat and be your farmer Jack
You can hold my sack while I pack your bag
You can rub my back while I tap your keg
One leg on the dash and one on the floor
I'll pop a cork in your ass and make you scream for more

[Hook 2][x2]
Money, hoes, tits and asses
We got the goods and the bullshit pass us
We got whatever you need
(I got ecstasy), I got pounds of weed
