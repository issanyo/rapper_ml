[Chorus 1]
Happy New Year, Happy New Year
Let’s raise a glass, here’s to you dear
Now I was hoping that I'd find you here
Just to wish you a Happy New Year

[Verse]
Kiss me pretty, kiss me pretty
When that ball drops on New York City
When that clock strikes I’ll pull you near
Just to wish you Happy New Year
I’ll quit smoking, I’ll quit eating
I’m not joking, I’ll quit cheating
I’ll quit cursing, I’ll quit drinking
I’ll be a better person, but tonight I’m thinking
Let’s get shit faced, let’s get shit faced
Let’s get into trouble, let’s get outta this place
And I’ll have faith in the coast that you clear
Say you love me, Happy New Year
Where’s my car keys? Where’s my car keys?
My place ain’t too far, we can crawl on our knees
What we’re feeling we can’t do here
Sexual healing Happy New Year
I know your thinking I must be crazy
Don’t sweat that small stuff, kiss me baby
Yeah it’s September, but with you here
Every night is a Happy New Year

[Chorus]
