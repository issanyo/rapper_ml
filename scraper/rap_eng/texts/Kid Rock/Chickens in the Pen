[Intro]
The mule keeps kicking the chickens in the pen

[Verse 1]
Half a million miles from the devil’s den
We could scoot it on over to the Dew Drop Inn
And if we do drop in we going to have us a time
Yeah we going to pour some wine
Uh oh we going to have us a time

[Chorus]
The mule keeps kicking the chickens in the pen
Let’s rock all night and then do it again
The clock keeps ticking, the cock can’t win
Let’s rock all night and then do it again

[Verse 2]
Sitting pretty, pretty on the top of the pile
We going to cool rock ski for a country mile
And if a country mile don’t get us in line
Yeah we going to pour some wine
Uh oh we going to have us a time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Baby let me love you let me take you higher
Sing ya sweet praise like a gospel choir
Baby let me love you let me take you higher
Come on girl let’s set the woods on fire
Come on, yeah, come on

[Chorus]
