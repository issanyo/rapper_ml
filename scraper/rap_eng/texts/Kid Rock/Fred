[Verse]
I had a realization of God, I saw God
And umm, it's not a face or a figure or anything
It was a presence, umm the woods
(all natural) God is all natural
The sun, the universe, everything
You, me were part of God, were part of God
It was an incredible feeling
And to use acid is religious for me
