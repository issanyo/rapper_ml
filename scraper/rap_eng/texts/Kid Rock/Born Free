[Verse 1]
Fast, on a rough road riding
High, through the mountains climbing
Twisting, turning further from my home
Young, like a new moon rising
Fierce, through the rain and lightning
Wandering out into this great unknown
And I don't want no one to cry
But, tell them if I don't survive

[Chorus]
I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

[Verse 2]
Free, like a river raging
Strong as the wind I’m facing
Chasing dreams and racing father time
Deep like the grandest canyon
Wild like an untamed stallion
If you can’t see my heart you must be blind
You can knock me down and watch me bleed
But you can’t keep no chains on me

[Chorus]
I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

[Verse 3]
And I'm not good at long goodbyes
But look down deep into my eyes
I was born free
Calm, facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets
Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waiting patiently for the sun to set
And when it's done, believe that I
Will yell it from that mountain high

[Chorus]
I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

[Outro]
I will bow to the shining sea
And celebrate God's grace on thee
