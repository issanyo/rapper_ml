[Verse 1]
I'm drunk again
Excuse the hiccup
The redneck originator
Rolling in my pick up
Truck jacked up with the 4 gold shocks
And where i come from
Mud flaps come in stock

People kid rock it
Up and down the block
And the hens all flock to the coup
With the cock
You wanna rock with me baby
Row it down to the swamp
Dock your boat
We'll do the hillbilly stomp
We'll do the hillbilly stomp

[Verse 2]
I like stuckies, truckers and big mesh hats
I like large round women in laundromats
I like to wander jack
Like a backwoods thug
And watch the moonshine through
The bottom of a jug
Hugging and kissing, with my vision all blurry
Sifting through this world of worry
Hurry up with love
Please God bless
I don't do drugs anymore
Or any less
I didn't start this mess on this planet
Stop looking at me like a bandit
I've been chilling
Down at the swamp
With the folks that want
To do the hillbilly stomp
Do it
We will do the hillbilly stomp

[Verse 3]
Now people wanna know how to do this dance
Lift your legs in the air like you wet your pants
Plant your hands on the top of your butt
And stomp around the woods
Like your all fucked up
Circle up the trucks
Fire up the brush
U tuck your shirt
Were gonna kick some dust
Don't two plus two it
Or three plus three it
Four by four to a place that's scenic
Heat it up like some hot ham hocks cooking
And hop to the spot where
Where the cops aren't looking
Bring your whole flock
Down to the stomp
And we can rock all night doing
The hillbilly stomp
Do it
The hillbilly stomp
The hillbilly stomp
