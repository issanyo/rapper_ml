[Intro]
You got a body like the devil and you smell like sex
I can tell you're trouble but I'm still obsessed

[Chorus]
Because you know you're so hot, I want to get you alone
So hot, I want to get you stoned
So hot, I don't want to be your friend
I want to fuck you like I'm never going to see you again
....Yeah.....Come on....Yeah

[Bridge]
You're like the kiss of death, like the hand of fate
I can tell you're trouble but I still want a taste

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse]
Because you're so hot I want to get you alone
I want to get you stoned
I don't want to be your friend
I want to fuck you like I'm never going to see you again

[Outro]
See you again[x2]
