[Verse 1]
People like the way my style is rolling
The crowd rebounds as I flow slowin
I'm not bullshitting
Heres how im hitting
Funkin it up more than George Clinton
Swingin, and bringin in a new format
A new breed indeed and I'm sure of that
I'll impress the best, I won't rest the best
Cause I'm blessed and I just won't settle for less
Yes the kid who gets the crowd up
The one with the hair that stands straight up
People look and stare in shock

[Chorus][X2]
Tripping over a Rock

[Verse 2]
Chased and chased and chased, but never close to caught
And the skills I filled were all self taught
With so many styles on each panfulls
And they hit ya like a fifth a jack daniels
As the girls admire the way I aspire
To move higher and build my own empire
Not a liar, I tell no lies
So hey girl you can trust these blue eyes
But don't get me wrong I get wicked
Shake that ass in my face and I'll stick it
Hit it, get wit it
Knock it out the box

[Chorus][X2]
Tripping over a rock

[Verse 3]
A genuine badman
Like Yosemite Sam man
I c-c-c-can rock the land
And bring a new swing and sensation
To represent the next generation
So slack up, you better back up
Come the score and you leave in a jigsaw
Fuck with me
With no doubt
I'll put my foot in your ass and won't pull it out
I'll go deep in I won't weaken
Guaranteed to keep the house leaping
Girls flockin guys
Try to to cockblock

Cause everybody's Tripping Over A Rock
