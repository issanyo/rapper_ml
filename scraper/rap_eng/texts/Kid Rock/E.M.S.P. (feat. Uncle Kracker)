This is the true story about mackin

Check it
Times are changin
Talk about it
More so each year
But the Early Mornin, Stoned Pimp is here

And if ya here me yaaaawwwwn

Hey hey hey
Well well well well
Hey hey hey

And I be catchin them northern pike
Like on a ten pound test
Posess, never fess, take a guess
I be the early mornin stoned pimp
Straight limpin
Boone's Farm drinkin
At the party big booty pinchin
Chillin, like a villian, balloon fillin
Whack MC killin, the fine hoe drillin
With the million dollar talent and the ten cent brain
Been gone too long, too much cocaine
But now that I'm back, on the block
I'm ready to rock
Left to right, all night
My game's tight, I wish you might
Take a bite
Out of this here toxic, melodic, neurotic product
Fresh from the harvest
Who'll be the largest, hardest, smartest, label in town
Top Dog get down, Uh
Radio won't play me
But still I got the kids around the world goin Kid Rock crazyin
Wicked witches be flyin on broomsticks
Kid Rock be comin with the boom boom boom biatch
I from the sticks biatch
Straight from the RO
Kid Rock I ain't's no bitch
Ah, yes you are hoe
So quit frontin like y'all don't know
When I step straight into the party with my homeboy Tino
What's up?
So get a good look bro, get a good gander
I'm made in Detroit, but my name ain't Stanzler
Spreadin' like a cancer, a virus
While you're lookin really gay like fuckin Billy Ray Cyrus
I'm the highest MC of all time
Got my mind on the D
And the D on my mind
And the line gets drawn when my eyes can't see
Hit me twice with the Tussin and the morphine IV
I be
What they call an O-G bitch
I'm the motherfuckin Early Mornin Stoned Pimp
Say what?

One time for you
Now throw your hands in the air and let's rock y'all
Just throw your hands up high, hip hop y'all

Because a Kid Rock party don't stop y'all

Now I'm the self made mack on a mountain on Mars
Got the money green, cut it with the high roll gloss
A Lincoln Continental and a Grand Marquis
Rag top, drop down, rollin on chrome D's biatch
The purple furs and the gold trim glasses
I only bust the fat asses
And I don't be givin a fuck who da hell can rap better than me
Cause I'm a true fuckin' player and I mack like a real G

From the bottom to the top
Partyin down with the slimmies in the cities that I rock
