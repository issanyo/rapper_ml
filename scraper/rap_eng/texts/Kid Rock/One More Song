[Verse 1]
It’s so damn fine to see you once again
It’s been so long and I sure could use a friend
My baby left me high and dry last evening
And all I can do is try and stop the bleeding
I got no money and feel so alone and I ain’t got much to say
I should be headed home right now but I think I’d rather stay
So play one more song, turn up the radio
And play one more song cuz I’m not ready to go, oh no

[Verse 2]
She was a hot little hooker and I wonder where she gone
Had a smile like summer and her legs were firm and long
She dressed to kill and she loved to rock n roll
She trashed my name and then she stole my soul
She said forever is what we’d be, but that ain’t what went down
So please won’t you have a friend in me and pour me another round

[Hook]
And play one more song
Some old time rock n roll
Yeah play one more song
But don’t play nothing slow
I don’t wanna hear them old sad songs cuz that’d just make me cry
I just wanna drink and dance all night and let the music be my guide yeah

[Verse 3]
I’m gonna call the band up and head out on the road
Cuz I got music deep inside my soul
I’m gonna sing from the heart and try to spark some change
Cuz good time music helps to ease the pain
And when the lights go down and the crowd gets loud, I’m gonna let her go
And if it feels right, I’ll stay all night if you’re not ready to go, if no one’s ready to go

[Hook 2]
I’ll play one more song, some back beat blue-eyed soul
I’ll play one more song, some Alabama Muscle Shoals
I’ll play one more song cuz I’m not ready to go
I’ll play one more song and ease my troubled soul
I don’t really care who’s wrong or right but I don’t wanna be alone tonight

[Outro]
So play one more song
Play one more song
Play one more song
Play one more song
Baby now, one more song
Sing it now, one more song
Play one more song
