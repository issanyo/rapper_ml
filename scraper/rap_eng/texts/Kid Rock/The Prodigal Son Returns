[Verse]
P-P-P pass the buddha, pass the buddha
Cause I wanna get, P-P-P pass the buddha
P-P-P pass the buddha, cause I wanna get off

All the fuckers that are trying to diss the Kid Rock
You can get shot, but first I'm gonna get hot
When it comes to rhymes I got a new Caddy
Cause you got about as much flavor as a fucking rice patty
"Gay Bob, don't quit your day job"
This might sound way-odd
But on the mic I'm God
And working hard for your money's what an ex told
Cause I won't sell my soul for some wax dipped in cheap gold
Par 4 motherfucker whatcha gonna do
1 wood, 7 iron and I'm on the green in 2
With 1 putt I'm lying birdy in the hole
I drive for show putt for dough
So give it up, hoe
I get a lot of funny looks
I'm stealing your music, my man
I ain't a fucking crook
You're playing dummy with your pride
And you can't tell me shit about a .45
And all that jive you preach, it's the poorest
God saved my soul, you save the fucking rain forest
And I'll meet you in hell
The prodigal son Kid Rock I rock well
(only time will tell)
Well it's that country boy from the midwest
Smoking grass and sniffing lines
And at first glance you wouldn't guess no
I even make my own homemade wine
Moonshine, Red wine, stir it up, drink it up
Roll it up, light it up, toke down, pass around
Cut it up, light it up, sniff it up, rock it up
Gimme a pipe and I just might smoke it
Object it, select it, clean it, protect it
Suck it in, tie it up, stick it in, inject it
All night, that's right, pop it drop it
Set it on your tongue and then trip til you peak
