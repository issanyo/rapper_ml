Daaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh

I need somebody, won't you help me
Yeah, I need somebody, won't you tell me who I am
Said I need somebody, please, please help me, yeah, yeah
Said I need somebody, you must tell me who I am
I've been living a lie so long it seems I've lived a lifetime
If you could see what I feel it'd make your ghetto look like Heaven
And I believe it stems down from my family situation
I never liked my old man
I couldn't stand to be around him
Sometimes I sit all alone just staring at his picture
My heart turns to stone and I think of this

You never loved me, you never held me tight
Instead you shook me like a beast to wake me up at night
You tried to make me think that your ways were best
When all I was was an outlet for all your stress

Life: it's the ultimate sin
A game with no rules that you're expected to win
My personal Hell's hidden with a grin
Dad take the stand and let the trial begin
You said that oil and water don't mix though it seems cool
Keep with your own and don't fuck up our gene pool
You should've went to school like your bigger brother
But you played the fool with a different color
Running ship with a whip
I tried to keep up but I kept getting tripped
Money made you so wise
How could you look through my face and not see your own eyes
Do as I say and not as I do
But I can't cause when I look in the mirror I see you
And oh the pain how it hurts
It was always your home and your business that came first
You said a man is as good as his word
But your mind was closed and mine never heard
My visions blurred, thoughts obscured
And with my blinders down I strayed from the heard
They say the nut don't fall far from the tree
Look at you, then look at me

You ain't nothing to me, you've never been to me
And all you ever gave a damn about was money see
So now fuck you man you ain't shit to me
And it's the day when I die of this hate that I'm free

Now I know growing up son that it ain't always been easy
And I know at times I was not always there for you
No, we never spent much time just talking or having a good time
But understand growing up son, I never had a dime
So I worked my ass off and I put myself through college
And everything I have to this day you know I built it all
Oh, I wish I could go back and change the years that's lost between us
I wish I could take back some of the things I said to you
Son, I said I'm sorry
Son, I said I'm sorry but still you resent me so
Son, I said I'm sorry and why do you resent me so

I always loved you, I always cared for you
Just never wanted you to go through what I've been through
I tried to raise my fucking family just the best I know
And now I'm hated like the Devil and for why I don't know

Dahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I need somebody, won't you help me
Yeah, I need somebody, won't you tell me who I am
Said I need somebody please, please help me, yeah, yeah
Said I need somebody you must tell me who I am
Tell me who I am
Tell me who I am
