[Kid Rock: Verse 1]
Day by day my life gets colder
My ice grows thin, as I get older
Peace in peaces, bloody and bruised
I feel so helpless and confused

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I hear screaming on the left
Yelling on the right
I'm sitting in the middle trying to live my life

[Chorus]
Because I can't stop the war
Shelter homeless, feed the poor
I can't walk on water
I can't save your sons and daughters
I can't change the world and make things fair
The least that I can do[x2]
The least that I can do is care

[Martina: Verse 2]
I pray and pray for life's salvation
Faith is tried and true in tribulation
Love is lost and lonely, check the news
And with these open arms I'll wait for you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[T.I: Verse 2]
For the life of me, I can't see how the devil keeps enticing me
All u sees a felon, I know god can see whats right in me
How I can be labeled as a villain in the first place
When the worst case senerio is my birth place
I'm just trying to keep from falling victim to the murder rate
Take my life lesson convincing the adolescents
There's a god up in heaven, sending down blessings
And your future ain't brighter than your present
Quit Stressing

[Pre-Chorus]
They re screaming on the left
Yelling on the right
While i'm sitting in the middle trying to live my life

[Chorus]
Because I can't stop the war
Shelter homeless, feed the poor
Can't walk on water I can't save your sons and daughters
I can't change the world to make things fair
The least that I can do is care

[Outro]
Yeah I can't stop the war
Shelter homeless feed the poor
I can't walk on water
I can't save your sons and daughters
I can't change the world and make things fair
The least that I can do[x3]
Oh is CARE
