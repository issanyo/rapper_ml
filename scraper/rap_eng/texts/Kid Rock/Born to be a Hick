[Verse]
1992
See I was born a little pie-eyed motherfucker
Mamma she left me and my pappa was a hard trucker
Out on the highway we loved to roll
He never made me go to school
I never begged to go
I was a low class livin raised out in the sticks
I was born to be a hick

[Chorus]
See I love to spend my days just a squirrel huntin
Go see my cousin Ellie May and get some good lovin
Kissing and hugging on some distant lands
People always tell me I'm a twisted man
Jim Beam in my hand boones kegged in shit
And I was born to be a hick
Ohhh I was born to be a hick

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And I was born to be a hick
See I was born to be a hick man
Yeah I was born to be a hick man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm a shotgun toking
I'm a John Deere driving
I'm a hick
Ah har
