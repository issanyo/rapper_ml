[Verse 1]
It’s the simple things in life
But life ain’t so simple right
Times get hard and people can make you mad
But I remember when I was young
I couldn’t wait to turn 21
To sit in the backyard sun and drink beer with dad

[Hook]
Drinking beer with dad
Out there on the back porch swinging
Drinking beer with dad
Picking my guitar and grinning

[Verse 2]
We’d hem and haw, we’d cuss and fight
But that’s where I learned life’s best advice
We’d talk about when I was young and bad
Sometimes he’d make me fightin’ mad
The best education I ever had
Was out there on the back porch drinking beer with dad

[Verse 3]
Nowadays most things have changed
This whole world is heading down the drain
There’s no God in schools
Totin' guns is the latest fad
A little discipline would sure be nice
A little lesson in wrong and right
Maybe it’s time young man to have a beer with dad

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I’d play him songs all through the night
Like praise the Lord I saw the light
We’d stay up late and make mom mad
But half the time we’d just laugh and laugh
Some of the best times I ever had
Was out there on the back porch drinking beer with dad

[Verse 5]
Now son I’m so damn proud of you
And the young man you’ve turned into
You’re the best son a father could ever have
And though your grandpa’s done past on
Soon you’ll be 21
So come on the back porch son and have a beer with dad

[Hook]

[Outro]
We’ll hem and haw, we’ll cuss and fight
But I’ll pass along life’s best advice
We’ll talk about your old granddad
The things he gave us he never had
I wish forever our time could last
I wish this world wouldn’t move so fast
Out here on the back porch
Out here on the back porch drinking beer with dad
