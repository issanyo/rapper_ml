[Verse 1]
Its been a hard night for Sarah
The divorce went through today
Ten years out the window
Shes been faithful all the way
Shes feeling really bitter
Shes feeling lost and small
She wonders where it all went wrong

Its been a hard night for Sarah
Shes taken quite a fall

[Verse 2]
Well he was all she ever hoped for
And she gave him all she had
Never gave a cause to worry
Never hurt her or made her sad

And no one thought to tell her
They all figured that she knew
Just another harmless fling
A phase all men go through

[Verse 3]
Its been a hard night for Sarah
Shes going to have to see it through
Gonna have to see it through

The sun is slowly rising
On another brand new day
The children will be waking soon
And shell send them on their way

[Outro]
Its been a hard night for Sarah[X3]
But today is another day
Today is another day
