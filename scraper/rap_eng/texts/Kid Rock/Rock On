[Verse 1]
Tears on the pillow
Is all you leave behind
And the only thing you know, this time
Is it's time to let go
So put the key under the mat
And don't you look back, just

[Chorus]
Rock on, baby rock on
You ain't got nothing to lose, that ain't already gone
'Cause trapped in these blues, ain't where you belong
So baby rock on

[Verse 2]
Let the songs and the static
Fight for the dial
Inside an addict's last passing mile
Well I know it ain't easy, but the wheel's in your hand
And who knows where you'll land, so just

[Chorus]
Rock on, baby rock on
You ain't got nothing to lose, that ain't already gone
'Cause trapped in these blues, ain't where you belong
So baby rock on

[Verse 3]
And baby don't stop, just
Rock on, baby rock on
You ain't got nothing to lose, that ain't already gone
I know your heart's black and blue, but life don't last long
So baby rock on
Baby rock on
