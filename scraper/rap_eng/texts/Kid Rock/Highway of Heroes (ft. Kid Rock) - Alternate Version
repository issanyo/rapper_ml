The day I shipped out
They numbered a hundred
Upon my return
Were a thousand or so
From the Gulf and from the Midwest
I bet they keep coming
Add one more name from Ohio

Carry me home down The Highway of Heroes
People above with their flags flying low
Carry me softly, down The Highway of Heroes
By the Dawn's Early Light
There was never more

I served with distinction
No visions of glory
I served without question
Or personal gain
Seek no justification
Its not part of my story
And it offers no comfort
To the ones who remain

Just carry me home down The Highway of Heroes
People above with their flags flying low
Carry me softly, down The Highway of Heroes
By the Dawn's Early Light
There was never more

I took up my vocation
I was called by my nation
Without hesitation
My answer I gave
Now I am not wondering
The things that I might have been
I'm a constellation
To the forgotten brave

So Carry me home down The Highway of Heroes
People above with their flags flying low
Carry me softly, down The Highway of Heroes
By the Dawn's Early Light
There was never more

Carry me home down The Highway of Heroes
People I love with their flags flying low
Carry me softly, down The Highway of Heroes

By the Dawn's Early Light
There was never more
There was never more
There was never more
There was never more
