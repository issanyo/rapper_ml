[Verse 1]
My Baby's fixing her face
Doing her hair
Running red lights in her underwear
She likes to step on the gas
Put her foot to the floor
Music to her ears when the engines roar

[Pre-Chorus]
There ain't much she can't do
(Anything I want to do)
But when I turn my back
(I'm a mean speed demon, heart attack)

[Chorus]
Baby Can't Drive
Baby Can't Drive
(I'm a million miles away
Doing a hundred and five
If you want to survive
Try and get there alive)
Baby Can't Drive
Baby Can't Drive

[Verse 2]
I got my red lips on
Making the stereo bleed
Texting my girls
While I'm driving with my knee
I'm doing my nails
I'm painting them black
Because baby's hit the road
And there's no going back
My knuckles turning white
Cause baby wants to drive all night
My Hair is turning grey
Cause baby wants to drive all day

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Baby can't drive
Baby can't drive
Yeah, yeah yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Baby, Baby
Baby, Baby can't drive
You know I love you baby
But baby can't drive
You just can't drive
I never said I could
Uh-uh, not my car
