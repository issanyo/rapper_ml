[Verse 1]
May be i have been on the road to long
Living my life threw these songs
I guess loving a music man
Really wasn't in your plans
Does it matter if i'm sorry again
And why should i apologize
You knew all along this was my life
You know my ins and outs
All my fears and doubts
Its the life i love
But its you i can't live without

[Chorus]
And this whole world seems
Cold and empty
Someone please turn on the lights
Lord if there's an angel you could send me
I could use one here tonight

[Verse 2]
Now where am i supposed to go
My only home was in your soul
I know that i can't stay here
And drown in a pool of tears
Should i pack my pride
And face this life alone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
May be its me who's cold and empty
And in my darkness i can't see the light
Please god if there's an angel
You could send me
Cause there's one missing from my life

You are my heart, you are my soul
Wherever you are, that where i go
You know my ins and outs
All of my fears and doubts
Its the life i love
But its you i can't live without
Yes its the life i love
But its you i can't live without
The life i love[X2]
But its you i can't live without
