[Verse 1]
I sense danger, I'm a stranger
I'm feeling major torn, cause I wasn't born in a manger
And my anger has no outlet
-- so all day long I smoke that sess
I never rest, never sleep, I'm a freak
Too cheap to talk, and so I scream like "YAHHHHHHHH!!!"
And everything that you stand for hates us
But everything your soul needs it awaits us

Huh
Kid Rock

[Chorus][x4]
So let's ride, not slide, let's mack
And if they say you can't go around her say FUCK THAT!

[Verse 2]
I sense danger, I'm a stranger
I'm feeling major torn, cause I wasn't born in a manger
I feel funny, and I smell like sex
-- but in my heart I have no regrets
So let's roll, pay your toll, get soul
Let me know, uphold, smoke a bowl like *SNIFFFFFF*
Because everything that you stand for hates us
But everything your soul needs it awaits us

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I see lights in my sights but they look dim
I never backed out or cracked out but I look thin
I want to fight for the right but I'm wrong
-- say you love me, now I'm gone
I never rest, never sleep, I'm a freak
Too cheap to talk, and so I shut up like {*guitar riff*}
And everything that you stand for hates us
But everything your soul needs it awaits us

[Chorus]

[Outro]
FUCK THAT![x8]
