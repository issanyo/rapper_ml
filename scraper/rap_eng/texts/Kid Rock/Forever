[Verse 1]
Haha
Ooh, I'm back (back), the fog is lifted
The earth has shifted, and raise the gifted
You knew I'd be back, so pack your bone
And hit the road Jack, because daddy's home
Wit the funky hot wrists, thick like Al Rocker
Pumping out hits, getting chips like Opera
Bitch I told ya, do not hate
Or question the music I make, ugh

[Chorus]
I make PUNK ROCK, and I mix it wit the HIP-HOP
I get you higher than a TREE TOP
You want to roll wit the KID ROCK (yeeaah!)
I make SOUTHERN ROCK, and I mix it wit the HIP-HOP
Got money like FORT KNOX, I'll forever be the KID ROCK
FOREVER!

[Verse 2]
The junky's are, still cigar smoking
Still the same cause I ain't change nutting
Huffing, and puffing; I got two rookies
All in check doing the redneck boogie
The king is back, to retract the wack
Re-pack my sack, wit the double fat back
Forget all that, I'm still singing (yeeaah!)
And like kids on monkey bars I'm still swingingg
Thought I got dusty, thought I'd get rusty
Thought I'd get rich and quit, oh he must be
Fat and ugly, broke black and blue
But I'm trim fit, rich and back for round two
Red, white and the Pabst Blue Ribbon
Dead right, that's how I'm living
Giving you more, that the false and fakes
They can't make the kinda music I make, eh-huh

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The black cat is back, in original form
The legible, credible, inevitable storm
Way past the normal, still misbehaving
Finger in the air and the flag still waving
Don't come, don't test the boss
Because I got this sewn like Betsy Ross
You can floss and front, you can taunt and tease
But you can't fuck wit rhymes like these
Thumping like a drum kit wit wrists that slit picks
Bumping for the kids who twist, splif and sips fifth
I got the gift I'm about to unravel
(Eight ball, side pocket) Eight ball in my jacket
Pussy and blow, you know how I live
"You can't say that Kid," fuck off, I just did
Watch me twirl, the earl, the pearl
Or just keep on Kid Rocking in the free world

[Chorus]

[Outro]
PUNK ROCK - FOREVER! HIP-HOP - FOREVER!
TREE TOP - FOREVER! KID ROCK! (yeah!)
