[Verse 1]

Everything I do gonna be funny



New Player on the field so yield and get back

To the wall

Cause I'm playing ya all

Like a game

K-I-D is the name

Some complain

And they got a little fame

And it's a shame

For what its worth

I'm down with earth

Pouring it on like Ms. Butter worth

Rich and thick

Kinda quick not slow

The rhymes I fit into flow

All in a row, from the intro

To the end so, ho

Put down the microphone and go

Step a side as I make room to bloom

Any opposing goo gets placed in a tomb

As soon as I grip the mic to get loose

Don't dispute because ya got no juice

Meanwhile I kick a rhyme from the pile

Huh, As I Cramp your style (style[?]style)



[Verse 2]

Cramp your style (Cramp your style[?]cramp your style)



Get down on your knees and pray when I break you

Down with a sound

Coming down with a pound

Or a bang

If you can't hang with the slang

That I exploit

Coming straight from Detroit

Rough without a doubt or a question

Kid Rock here in the flesh

And addressing and defining certain issues

To diss you (he diss me..aheo)

So wipe the tears from your eyes

You can't hide so don't be surprised

When I dismiss you from your throne

And send you home

As a Kid Rock clone

Cause I can hold my own

Like ya hold a milk bone

Simple as this with a grip that won't quit

So when I hit the skit

That's it

So don't come in face with the base

And remember your just an imitation

Don't get buck-while

In fact don't smile

Cause I'll pull your file

As I Cramp your style (style[?]style)



[Verse 3]

Cramp your style (cramp your style[?]cramp your style)

I'll claim the boundaries of my domain

Detroit[?]Detroit

Fresh, I'm from the Midwest

From MoTown[?]From MoTown



I'm like steel or concrete yo cause I'm the hardest

Down with a label known to be the largest

Not being modest don't even think of trying to hang

Cause yo Kid Rock rolls like a Stop O

I roll thick

I roll heavy

D-Nice justs keeps the pace steady

So get ready to feel the pain

I'm Kid Rock driving girls insane

So listen rappers and get to the program

Breaking ya down is the Kid rock slogan

And any rapper who thinks about dissing

You know what I'll say?

I got a great big dick

So anyone who can't adjust

Gets rust

And then bites the dust

Be ready to walk a mile

Cause I'll smack that Kool-Aid smile

As I Cramp your style (style[?]style)

Cramp your style (cramp your style[?]cramp your style)
