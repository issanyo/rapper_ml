[Verse 1]
This here is no love song
And it is not for you
Its for the folks that relate to
What i have been going through
Its for the 40 hour overtime
Working man
And too the good women out there
I know you'll understand

Why don't you run off to L.A
And lose your mind
And get some energy doctor to tell
You everything is fine
We can still be friends like you talk about
But first give me back them pearls
And the keys to my fucking house
Get out

[Chorus]
They say all wee need is just a little patience
But what do you do when your woman
Is too high maintenance yea
I'm hating to admit it
Even if its your wife
Tell her pack your shit
And take the first train out of my life

[Verse 2]
Its a classic line baby
I just wanna be friends
But baby my friends don't have the keys to my Mercedes Benz, no
I think i know what you mean
You wanna talk and such
Tell me all your problems
But we don't fuck
Its is not that right
I had plenty of friends before i met you
I don't need no more
So now i thinks its time you started heading out for that door and even tho i feel real bad tonight
Please pack your shit
And take the first train out of my life

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Why don't you run off to L.A
And lose your mind
Louver got 15 minutes and
I think your wasting time yea
Its easy to see when you've lost your mind
But here ill be when you decide to come back blind
You were a mid-west girl who says
She liked to drink beer and hang
And now your walking red carpets talking new York hip hop slang
And even though i might break down
And cry tonight
Please pack your shit
And take the first train out of my life oh yea yea

Why don't you run off to L.A
