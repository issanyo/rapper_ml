[Verse]
I like moonshine whiskey
I like home made wine
I don’t look for greener grass
Home grown suits me just fine
Welcome to my shanty
Drop by anytime
I bet you’ll like my Redneck Paradise
Redneck Paradise
It’s a hole in the wall kind of small but the people are real nice
And folks in here they’s free and clear
To drink beer and dance all night, that’s right
And no one’s uptight in Redneck Paradise
Now I might get a little tipsy
I might be past my prime
But pour some Jim Beam whiskey
And I’ll show you a real big time
You don’t need reservations
Drop by anytime
The sun is shining in Redneck Paradise
And the things we like don’t cost a lot of money
Good foot stomping music gets us by
Measure up our wealth in friends and family
We’re going to hit them honky tonks tonight
Down in Redneck Paradise
It’s a hole in the wall kind of small just look for the red light
And have no fear you’re free and clear to get wild and rock all night
We don’t bite
Because we get down right in Redneck Paradise

[Chorus][x2]
Down in Redneck Paradise
It’s a hole in the wall kind of small but the people are real, real nice
And when you’re here you’re free and clear to do what most ever you like, all night
So rock on through to Redneck Paradise
