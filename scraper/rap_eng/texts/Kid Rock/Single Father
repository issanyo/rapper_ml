[Verse 1]
Lately i have been spending lots of time with my kid
Telling him stories
About the things that we did
When we were a family
Long time ago
I've answered his questions
Till i'm blue in the face
Wish all that hurt in him
I could erase
But i tell him the truth
Cause he is not to young to know

[Chorus]
Single father
Part time mother
When i'm not one
Then i'm the other
You used to be
My full time lover
Now i'm a single father
And a part time mother

[Verse 2]
I spend every minute
I can with my boy
There's no doubt about it
Hes my pride and joy
Someday he will grow up
And i won't have him no more
Some things i just find
Too hard to explain
So we go to McDonald's
Or i buy him a train
And we go put it together
On the living room floor

Such is the life
Of a single father
He says daddy explain
If its not too much bother
While its just you and me
Living here in this home
I don't understand it
And neither does he
Why there's just two
When there should be three of us
Sharing this moment
Lord i feel so alone

[Chorus]
