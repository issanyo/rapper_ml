I sense danger, I'm a stranger
I'm feelin' major torn, cause I wasn't born in a manger
And my anger has no outlet
So all day long I smoke that sess
I never rest, never sleep, I'm a freak
Too cheap to talk, and so I scream like yeah!
And everything that you stand for hates us
But everything your soul needs it awaits us

So let's ride, not slide, let's mack
And if they say you can't go around her say fuck that
So let's ride, not slide, let's mack
And if they say you can't go around him say fuck that
So let's ride, not slide, let's mack
And if they say you can't come around here say fuck that
So let's ride, not slide, let's mack
And if they say you can't come around me say fuck that

I sense danger, I'm a stranger
I'm feelin' major torn, cause I wasn't born in a manger
I feel funny, and I smell like sex
But in my heart I have no regrets
So let's roll, pay your toll, get soul
Let me know, uphold, smoke a bowl like
Cause everything that you stand for hates us
But everything your soul needs it awaits us

So let's ride, not slide, let's mack
And if they say you can't go around her say fuck that
So let's ride, not slide, let's mack
And if they say you can't go around him say fuck that
So let's ride, not slide, let's mack
And if they say you can't come around here say fuck that
So let's ride, not slide, let's mack
And if they say you can't come around me say fuck that

I see lights in my sights, but they look dim
I never backed out or cracked out, but I look thin
I wanna fight for the right, but I'm wrong
Say you love me, now I'm gone
I never rest, never sleep, I'm a freak
Too cheap to talk, and so I shut up like
And everything that you stand for hates us
But everything your soul needs it awaits us

So let's ride, not slide, let's mack
And if they say you can't go around her say fuck that
So let's ride, not slide, let's mack
And if they say you can't go around him say fuck that
So let's ride, not slide, let's mack
And if they say you can't come around here say fuck that
So let's ride, not slide, let's mack
And if they say you can't come around me say fuck that

Fuck that
Fuck that
Fuck that
Fuck that
Fuck that
Fuck that
Fuck that
Fuck that
