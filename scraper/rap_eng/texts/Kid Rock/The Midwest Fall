Listen to the wind, lonesome is the sound
Blowing in changes and breaking through this town
Listen to the heartbeat, heartland's barely breathing
Hope and faith are still alive but jobs are steady leaving

It chills me to the bone
Brings a tear to my eye
Like the last days of summer gone
It's hard to watch a good thing die

In the days of my youth there was dancing in the streets
Ford was building motorcars and folks were building dreams
'Round the clock, day and night, working hard's a way of life
As I recall

It chills me to the bone
Brings a tear to my eye
Like the last days of summer gone
It's hard to watch a good thing die

It's the Midwest fall, blue collar life
Staring at December, dreaming about July
The Midwest fall, dreams get blown away
It's hard to take the Midwest fall

My grandpa was a union man, my daddy watched it burn
We never had a lot, we lived off what we earned
We built the cars and tanks that helped to keep our nation free
And now I can't afford to feed my family

It chills me to the bone
Brings a tear to my eye
Like the last days of summer gone
It's hard to watch a good thing die

It's the Midwest fall, blue collar life
Staring at December, dreaming about July
The Midwest fall, dreams get blown away
It's hard to take the Midwest fall, oh, oh yeah

I can't pay my taxes, Lord
I can't afford to feed my kids
I guess I'll stay and ride it out
Because you are so beautiful, yeah

The Midwest fall, blue collar life
Staring at December, dreaming about July
The Midwest fall, dreams get blown away
It's hard to take

The Midwest fall, oh, don't go away
The Midwest fall, dreamin', dreamin'
The Midwest fall, ah, don't go away
It's hard to take, please don't go away you are so beautiful

The Midwest fall
The Midwest fall
The Midwest fall
The Midwest fall
