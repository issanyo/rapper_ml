[Verse 1]
You know I spent a little time out in Malibu
I spent quite a bit down in Nashville too
Because I like the beach and loves to honky tonk
But the place that I call home
Is where I never have to feel alone
It's the place where I was raised and I was born

[Pre-Chorus]
And the grass don't get much greener
And life can't get no sweeter
I got a funny cigarette and a two-dollar bottle of wine
And there's no need for new beginnings
More money or window trimmings
And if the good Lord's willing, I'm a keep on chilling, refilling and flying high

[Chorus]
Flying high
In an old lawn chair
Flying high
With an ice cold beer
Got nowhere to go, no place I'd rather be
Yeah the grass don't get much greener
And life can't get no sweeter
And if the good Lord's willing, I'm a keep on chilling, refilling and flying high

[Verse 2]
You know I've traveled on yachts threw the south of France
Think I even got a pair of Versace pants
But all that makes me feel is like a fool
Because a pontoon boat, and a bottle of Beam
A couple good friends, and some cut off jeans
Has made us realize, you can't buy cool

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
