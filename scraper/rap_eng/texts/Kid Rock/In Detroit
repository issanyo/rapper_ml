[Verse]
Bad ass on track, the big for trucks
We spend the day on the lining, the nights lit up
We rock blue jeans tees, Old English Ds
So baby you best to believe that’s how we do it in Detroit
That’s how we do it in Detroit
Up in the D, D, D
We’re the real deal trick, about as real as it gets
We don’t pay that high class Hollywood sh*t
We don’t start drama, but if it’s around
Say hello to a Motown throw-down in Detroit
That’s how we do it in Detroit[x2]
Up in the D, D, D
Yeah that’s how we do it in the D baby
Blue and gray all the way, and we came to play
So what’s up now dawg?
With the big brown fist, with the “can’t stop soul”
The high, proud city always ready to roll
Get your bunch of data, get to see this through
Cause tough times don’t last, tough people do

[Chorus][x3]
In Detroit
That’s how we do it in Detroit[x2]
Up in the D, D, D, D, D
In Detroit
