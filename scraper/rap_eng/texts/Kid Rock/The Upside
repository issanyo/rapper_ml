[Intro]
White boy get ready to do his thing's here
Uh[?]Uh[?]Uh[?]Uh[?]Uh[?]Uh

[Verse 1]
Here's a new jam for you to cling to
A funky rythm that you can swing to
Kid Rock that's me
And the party jumpin is what I'm for seeing
So just chill or I'll boot you
Get on me and I'll shoot you
I'm fresh to that there's no guessing
Rock the mic without any fessin
With your blessin
I will get stupid, you didn't know it
I thought you knew it
I'm the kid that comes exactin
With my ace the black man
To B Boys from the Midwest
Rock the shows cause were professionals
On the set night and day while the girls say

[Chorus]
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round

[Verse 2]
The bass drops and works its hardest
For Kid Rock the new young rap artist
Clockin paper cause I got soul
Comin at you from the Motor capital
Shakin booties
Not all the cuties
I'm too cool to be a little fruity
Drinkin forties every weekend
I'm the master who's always speaking
To some freak and if I freak her
It's at Red Roof Inn where we sleep cheaper
But off that topic got to get it
Super dope, extremely poetic
The K-I-D-R-O-C-Kin
I love girls that's how its layin
With these jammies
Fuck the grammies
All I care about is shaking fannies
And I have been doin it for a long time
But now I'm nineteen
And in my prime
Waxing booties everyday while the girls say

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
On the mic is solo
Cause I'm the Kid with all the dope lingos
Only rappin cause I don't sing dope
Create a jam that's fresh in your bingo
Lace up the Reebox
Comb the high top
Black dose with a little hip hop
And I style it with some uniqueness
You say I'm not fresh
But I could careless
One of a kind
When I rock the mic
And I'm the one that your girl is likin
Picture the girless women not lookin
Create a beat that is fully hookin
Cause when I get dumb
People have fun
Sisco save me the magnum
In a hell of a show I always display
While the girls say

[Chorus]
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round

[Outro]
Upside Kid Rock, Kid Rock
He's on the upside
Get down Kid Rock
He's on the upside
Get down Kid Rock
On the Upside
Upsideeeeeeeee
Upside get down Kid Rock
Your on the Upside
Get down Kid Rock
Your on the Upside
Get down Kid Rock
Your on the Upside
Upside
