[Verse #1]
Because growing up I was never the logical one
Packed my shit and left home like the prodigal son
With a bottle of Jack and my shotgun strapped
I went looking for fame and you I've never been back
Filled with spite staying high as a kite
I was dealin' and stealin' everything in sight
Pool hustling trying to make that green
I've been rambling and gambling since the age of 13
Working like a bitch like a god damn tank
Some disagree because my 'rents had bank
But all that's gold don't always glitter
So I'll take another puff from my one hitter
I'm a slave to the trade I'm paid to rhyme
Blow all my cash on cheap women and wine
Because money, money, money isn't shit to me
But I got to make a lot just to be free

[Refrain]
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock bitch and I'm everywhere
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock ho and I'm everywhere

[Chorus]
Many nights she comes to me
She feels me where I lay
I hope to God one day she'll see that my love is not that way
She holds me in the morning time and never lets me go
I hope that one she'll see and she come in to my show

[Verse #2]
Please God, please I'll pay any cost
If you'd just stop the world because I want to get off
There's too much hardship there's too much pain
There's too many motherfuckers tryin to get in my brain
I've been to your mountains I've been to your seaside
And everywhere I went somebody's wanted a free ride
But parasites can't fade the Rock
And any suckers that step in my way are getting shot
Because I hold key to my own success
And suckers that step willll be put to rest, yes
I hold the key to my own success
And suckers that step will catch a bullet in their chest
So pass the buddha
The funky tie hooter
And watch me rip because I'm such a slick shooter
Not a generic dime a dozen m.c.,
Never was in a posse never wanted to be

[Refrain]
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock bitch and I'm everywhere
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock ho and I'm everywhere

[Chorus]
Many nights she comes to me
She feels me where I lay
I hope to God one day she'll see that my love is not that way
She holds me in the morning time and never lets me go
I hope that one she'll see and she come in to my show

[Verse #3]
Now I've been walking the earth since the beginning of time
And won't leave till I've received that 7th sign
All this talk they're going to drop the bomb
But life keeps going on and on and on and on
The world's end don't worry me
And I'm going to get where I'm going just hurry me
Because I'm in no rush and I can't stand rushing
Everything is slow motion like I'm tripping on tussin
Fussing with the girls they waste my time
Thrashing and bashing going out of my mind
Crucified by the critics everyday
Because I am not really got that much to say
I'm a slave to the trade I'm paid to rhyme
I don't wear a watch and i don't keep time
I live my life just like the skipper
But only at night because I'm a day tripper
Twitching-shaking
And I kick more bass then John Paul Jones
Visions of red shoot through my head
And I won't stop tripping till the day I'm dead

[Refrain]
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock bitch and I'm everywhere
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock ho and I'm everywhere

[Chorus]
Many nights she comes to me
She feels me where I lay
I hope to God one day she'll see that my love is not that way
She holds me in the morning time and never lets me go
I hope that one she'll see and she come in to my show
