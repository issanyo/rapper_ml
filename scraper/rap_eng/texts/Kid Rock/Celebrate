[Verse 1]
Everlasting things that most can’t see
Fads and fashion never meant that much to me
Isn’t worth asking girl we could have it all
Shotgun blasting having ourselves a ball

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it’s late but your daddy’s not done yet
So let’s rock this spot till the sunset

[Chorus]
I want to celebrate
Rock, rock the whole night away
Hey we going to celebrate yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Show me your bad side girl let’s funk around
Move to the inside now baby let me break it down
It’s that feeling that just can't be denied
And I been pheening that little tight uhmp and big blue eyes

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
I want to celebrate
Baby, no it can’t wait
Hey we going to celebrate yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Momma’s in the kitchen cooking crawfish pie
Daddy’s by the river watching fish swim by

[Outro]
I want to celebrate yeah, yeah, yeah
