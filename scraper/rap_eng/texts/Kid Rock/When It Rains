[Verse 1]
Like a deer in the headlights, I stood frozen in my tracks
And the weight of the news, It nearly broke my back
It was late September, and I remember oh so well
I put a rose in the bible and placed it on my shelf

[Chorus][x2]
Now when it rains, it pours
Wish I didn't know now the things I never knew before

[Verse 2]
Back then when we were 17
Time was on our side
Holes in our jeans and a pocket full of dreams
The future was Friday night
And we would hangout down by the river-bend
Singing our favorite songs
Laughing and drinking, smoking and smiling
Now those days are gone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Like a deer in the headlights, I stood frozen in my tracks
And the weight of you not here nearly broke my back
And the tears they fell like a monsoon
Underneath the cold fall moon
Somehow God put his hands on your shoulders
Way too, way too soon

[Outro]
Now when it rains, it pours
Wish I didn't know now the things I never knew before
Now when it rains, it pours
Wish I didn't know now
No I didn't know now
What I knew before
