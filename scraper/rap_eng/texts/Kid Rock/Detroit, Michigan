[Verse 1]
Talking about soul, soul, soul
Hey Memphis
Talking about rock and roll
Hey Texas
New York City’s uptown grooves
A little Mississippi Delta blues
Flossing Austin and the Boston Pops
And everybody knows that Cleveland rocks
Talking about girls, girls, girls
California
Talking about fine, fine girls
Oklahoma
A downtown Nashville honky-tonk
Some big fat back beat DC funk
Jacksonville and the Southern rock
In New Orleans the party never stops

[Chorus]
Detroit, Michigan

[Verse 2]
You heard about Marvin Gaye, we got him
Can I get a witness?
Talking bout Hitsville USA we got it
How sweet it is
We got those fine, fine super Supremes
The kind of girls you see in your dreams
When you hear our thundering sound
You know it comes from Detroit town
Talking about Rosa Parks we sent her
Talking about Henry Ford the inventor
Talking about Aretha yeah we got her
The Queen of Soul
Bob Seger yeah we got him
And that old time rock and roll
Slim Shady set the world on fire
The Big Three baby and the finest cars
George Clinton’s P Funk all stars
We spend our days on the line and our nights in the bars

[Chorus]
