[Verse 1: Kid Rock]
A shimmy shimmy go go motherfucking pop
It's the K-K-Kid Rock with the K-K-Kid Rock shit
I'm on top bitch and rock for tricks
Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips
I get all the money pussy falls like rain
Been getting laid and paid that's why I never complain
If I ain't in it for the money I'm in it for the P
It's 1998 yo and you still can't fuck with me
You don't be fucking with the blue eye
Fucking with my 2-5 up your fucking ass like my shoe size
I got a new vibe, kinda like Voodoo
You do what we say and we'll do what we want to
We're fucking up your city and we're fucking up your program
Fucking all your bitches we can fucking give a goddamn
Twisted Brown gets down with no assistance
We won't quit until we're banned from existence
Persistence pays if that holds true
Then I'm gonna buy this fucking planet before the time I'm through
I was praised and raised on the thoughts of no fakings
So let me get what I got coming and the rest I'm taking
I'm shaking like Jerry Lee Lewis and shit
You act like the motherfucker's new at this shit
But I've been true to this shit giving my heart and soul
Been shining like a diamond but getting passed as coal
So Fuck Off
Yeah

[Verse 2: Kid Rock]
With my pants half hanging off my ass and shit
Bowl filled hash pockets stuffed with cash
I be the mushroom tripping sipping shots of Jack
Cause the kids don't listen getting lots of flak
I be the do wah diddy up and down you block and
The 10 karat Kid with my triggers cocking
The K the I the D R-O-C-K motherfucker and you still don't know me
So blow me bitch I don't rock for *cancer*
I rock for the cash and the topless dancers
Don't have no answers so pass the joint
I'm just paid in full and made in Detroit
I ride like Senna in the Indy 5
And get live with that which get's me high
Strive for perfection this much is true
We do what we say you say what we do
Kid Rock I couldn't be no Bozo
And I get too much P to ever *be no homo*
I rock from SoHo to Arizona
I'm an easy rider dreaming of Winona
I roam the country like a Greyhound bus
Put faith in lust and in God I trust
I'm not Peter Pan I don't fuck with fairies
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries
And Harry Caray couldn't call my game
Fucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame
And I show no shame from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag, but I like to boast
Fuck Off

[Interlude: Kid Rock]
Yeah right in your mother fucking ass bitch
With that Detroit city shit ain't shit swift we're on the same script
Nothing new since '76 Kid Rock
Yo, Slim Shady come break these motherfuckers off

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yo!
Tell the world to hold their breath, they're breathin' the wrong air
This planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair
Two white boys who spike punch and light joints
Hang around drugs, loud music and like noise
Slim Shady and Brown Trucker another bunch of motherfuckers
Who hate the world just as much as each other
And I ain't leavin' this party tonight
Till I see some naked bitches dancing around drunk touchin' each other
Rum and Pepsi got your whole perception of me sketchy
Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me
Cause all I do is curse and fuck
So when I do shrooms you all better give me two rooms
Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up
So when you see me on your block, you better lock your cars
Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars
This is for children who break rules
People that straight fools and every single teenager that hates school!
FUCK OFF!
