[Verse 1]
We haven’t really talked about it
All we do is walk around it now
I hate to say I’ve thought about it
I wish that we could make this work somehow
It’s not really complicated
I can hear it when you sigh
Comes a time we have to face it
Maybe it’s just time to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Lately I can feel us drifting
Even though the good outweighs the bad
Feels like our world is shifting, but yet you are the best I’ve ever had
I still love to watch you sleeping
I still see that look in your eye
But there’s seeing and believing
And maybe it’s just time to say goodbye

[Hook]
Say goodbye, to all the times we treasure
Say goodbye, let the chips fall where they lie
Say goodbye, to things we cannot measure
Walk away, say goodbye

[Verse 4]
I’ll remember you forever
I’ll remember every single year
Running through the rain and laughing
And later in our bed with you so near
And I know when I am older
And the clouds fill up the sky
I may look over my shoulder
And know I was too young to say goodbye
Years from now when I am older
I may sit and wonder why
Will I look over my shoulder
And know I was too young to say goodbye
I was just too young to say goodbye
Say goodbye
