[Verse 1]
I heard that you been talking ‘bout me
Walkin’ round without a tear in your eye, eyes, eyes
Airing out my dirty laundry while trying to suck my well bone dry, dry, dry
You ain’t nothing but complicated
Everything you preach is a lie
Everything I try you hate it
So baby why don’t you just fuck off and die

[Verse 2]
I heard that you been speaking softly
Trying to toss my good name under the bus, bus, bus
Creeping ‘round with everybody
Hey baby whatever happened to trust, trust, trust

[Verse 3]
You ain’t nothing but complicated
Every time you love it’s a lie
You got me so damn agitated
So baby why don’t you just fuck off and die
Fuck off and die
All your lies and hatred
Fuck off and die
All the good times wasted
Die for the good yeah die for the bad
Die for the memories we’ll never have
C’est la vie adios fuck off and die

[Verse 4]
I’m giving you an ultimatum
Cuz I ain’t gonna watch you break him down, down, down
You told me you were trying to save him
But all you did was sit back and watch him drown, drown, drown
The truth is far from how you played it
Everything you said was a lie
All this time I watched you fake it
So baby why don’t you just fuck off and
You ain’t nothing but complicated
You put me down every time I try
You’re so damn jealous I finally made it
So baby why don’t you just fuck off and die
So baby now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Yeah fuck off and die
