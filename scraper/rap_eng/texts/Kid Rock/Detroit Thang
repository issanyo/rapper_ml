It's a Detroit thing, everybody
It's a Detroit thing, tell your body
It's a Detroit thing, gonna show you right

[Verse 1]
I'm bout to say the law, cause i'm the K-I-D
I'll be whipping and flipping rhymes from the fucking D
And for the peoples, and for the peoples
There is nobody in the D being equals to us
So i bust, cause it's a must that i go for my
With another funky Detroit rhyme, yeah
I got it all like Jack, and my shit is Phat, you know that
And ya don't stop, and ya don't stop
Somebody in the houses?

Can i get a soul clap y'all, a soul, a soul clap y'all
There's a party in the D, where ya at yo

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I be busting and flicking, for the mother fucks
Cause i'm the bigging with the rock

Talking about John Lee, I'm talking 'bout the P funk
Come on lets get drunk
Get a glass of wine, you'll be feeling fine
Rock is on the mic., i'm about to go for mine
Got my shoelaces laced up, my hat turned back
My shit is Phat, you know that

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I am not talking about Philly, no

To the beach you all, so unique you all
