[Verse 1]
Midnight riding in my old two seater rolling down the boulevard
Headlights shining on rusty fences as I pass the rail yard
Black leather jacket on a Friday night
Fire up the lighter and a lucky strike
The radio's saying "Take a walk on the wild side"
And it's got me feeling like...

[Chorus 1]
Go wide open it's a pedal down kind of a thing
Little bit of Mo-Town smooth
A little bit of Memphis Blues
A sea of emotion raining all over me
Give me that heart and that soul
American rock 'n roll

[Verse 2]
I can see the banner on the courthouse flying proud red, white, and blue
I can see her waiving on the corner smiling cause she feels just like I do
Now she's sitting right next to me
Everything's how it oughta be
Being young in the land of the free
And she's got me feeling like...

[Chorus 2]
Go wide open it's a pedal down kind of a thing
A little bit of Folsom Blues
A little bit of gangster smooth
A sea of emotion raining all over me
Give me that heart and that soul
American rock 'n roll

[Bridge]
Midnight riding in my old two seater rolling down the boulevard
Headlights shining on rusty fences as I pass the rail yard
And it's got me feeling like...

[Chorus 3]
Go wide open it's a pedal down kind of a thing
A little bit of Delta Blues
A little "Blue Suede Shoes"
A sea of emotion raining all over me
Give me that heart and that soul
American rock 'n roll
American rock 'n roll
American rock 'n roll
American rock 'n roll
