[Intro]
Turn me up in the headphones

[Verse]
Been a lot of cheap talk but I rock still
From the streets of Shanghai back to Knoxville
Sitting high on a mountain top holding shop spreading the good news
Been alotta false prophets and quick hits
And a lot of unAmerican bullshit
But the time has come to settle and the devil's going to make you choose
And just like a cold wind blowing can you feel me coming for u
Just like a freight train rolling packed tight full of rhythm and blues
Testify
It's a Rock revival
Don't need a suit
You don't need a bible
Get up and dance
I'm going to set you free yeah
Testify
It's all sex, drugs, rock n roll
A soul sensation that you can't control
And you can see I practice what I preach
I'm your rock and roll Jesus
Yes I am
Been a lot of bling bling but it isn't real
And a lot of new kings but I won't kneel
Sitting high on a mountain top, holding shop singing the raw dog blues
Like in old Mississippi's dirty cotton fields
Or in Detroit City's unforgotten wheels
It's the same song spinning but the same song's always been true
And I'm going to take my roll because I am not got nothing to lose
And I'm going to save your soul if it's really what you want me to do

[Outro]
I'm your rock and roll Jesus
