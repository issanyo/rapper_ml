[Verse 1]
Baby when i think about you
I think about love
Darling don't live without you
And you love
If i had these golden dreams
Of my yesterdays
I would wrap you in heaven
Till i'm dying on the way
Feel like makin love
Feel like making love to you
Baby if i thinking about you
I think about love
Darlin if i live without you
I live without love

[Verse 2]
If i had the sun and the moon
I would give you both night and day
Of satisfying
Feel like making
Feel like makin love
Feel like making love to you
And if i had those golden dreams
Of my yesterdays
I would wrap you in heaven
Till im dyin on the way
Feel like making love[X2]
Feel like making love to you
