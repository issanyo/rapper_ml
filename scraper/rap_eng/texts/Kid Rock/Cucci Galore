[Chorus 1]
Don’t you want to go down?
Come on, come on, come on

[Chorus 2]
My name’s Cucci, Cucci Galore
My name’s Cucci, Cucci Galore

[Verse 1]
Everybody naked in the hot tub
Everybody want a baby oil back rub
Drinking Champagne from your belly button
Licking it up like wine
Everybody want to make it with a playmate
Everybody want to drive through the front gate
In a jet black Lamborghini
Leopard print fur lined

[Chorus 2]
My name’s Cucci, Cucci Galore
My name’s Cucci, Cucci Galore

[Chorus 1]
Don’t you want to go down?
Come on, come on, come on

[Chorus 2]
My name’s Cucci, Cucci Galore
My name’s Cucci, Cucci Galore

[Verse 2]
Everybody wearing edible bikinis
Everybody want a chocolate martini
Naomi Campbell on a polar bear rug
Afternoon delight
Hanging out with Hef down in the grotto
Heartbreaker farm fresh from Ohio
Prove it to me you’re a natural blonde
Caught a bunny in a lie

[Chorus 2]
My name’s Cucci, Cucci Galore
My name’s Cucci, Cucci Galore

[Chorus 1]
Don’t you want to go down?
Come on, come on, come on

[Verse 3]
What the fuck d’you say?
Bitch, go get your clothes
Hell no, you can’t sleep here
Huh, me?
They call me Bobby, Bobby Shazam[x3]
Bitch, my name is Bobby Shazam
Pamela’s here hanging with a douchebag
I’m sipping on a full fifth of Red Stag
Short stories and a couple of vials
Detroit city style!!

[Chorus 1]
Don’t you want to go down?
Come on, come on, come on

[Chorus 2]
My name’s Cucci, Cucci Galore
My name’s Cucci, Cucci Galore
