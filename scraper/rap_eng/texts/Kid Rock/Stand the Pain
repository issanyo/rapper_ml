[Verse 1]
And when life it burns you like a candle
Don't think it ain't nothing that you can't handle
Go ahead,now finish what you started
You're not the last one left who's broken hearted, no

[Chorus]
When it feels like you just can't stand the pain
When it feels like you just can't stand the pain
And when it feels there's nothing left that you can do
Just bow your head down and plow right through
When it feels like you just can't stand the pain

[Verse 2]
Sometimes life's plans can be postponed
And it's hard to step back out into the unknown
But should you ever find yourself alone
You gotta friend right here if you come back home
Come back home

[Chorus]
When it feels like you just can't stand the pain
When it feels like you just can't stand the pain
And when it feels there's nothing left that you can do
Just bow your head down and plow right through
When it feels like you just can't stand the pain

[Chorus]
When it feels like you just can't stand the pain
When it feels like you just can't stand the pain
And when it feels there's nothing left that you can do
Just bow your head down and plow right through
When it feels like you just can't stand the pain
When it feels like you just can't stand the pain
When it feels like you just can't stand the pain
