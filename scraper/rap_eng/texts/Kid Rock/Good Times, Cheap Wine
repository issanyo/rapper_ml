[Verse 1]
I ain’t never been a champagne drinking man
And I ain’t never been a Coldplay music fan
I ain’t never gonna fit into skinny jeans
And Coachella honey really ain’t my kind of scene

[Hook]
I like some good times, cheap wine, back beat rock and roll
I’m like fine wine, sunshine, baby I never get old
If you’re lookin’ for a hot mess, honey well here I am
Hey you can try to change me or love me just the way I am

[Verse 2]
I ain’t never gonna have four million friends
And I ain’t never gonna follow the latest trends
I don’t wanna read your Facebook posts or tweets
I just wanna hold you close and feel your heart beat

[Hook]

I want to squeeze you, hug you, shake you and make you scream
I want to dance all night with you by the record machine

[Hook]

[Outro]
If you’re lookin’ for a hot mess, honey well here I am
You can try to change me or love me just the way I am
Hey, you can try to change me or love me just the way I am
Yeah you can try to change me or love me, love me just the way I am
