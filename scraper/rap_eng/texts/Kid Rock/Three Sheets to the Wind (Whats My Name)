[Chorus][x3]
What's my name?
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock

[Verse 1]
Ahhhhhhh...
I'm here and it's clear I'm going to flow so yo, black
Just get on up or yo get the bozak
Because it isn't Kojak or Dr. Seuss
It's the kid, motherfucker and I'm going to get loose
Because I got the juice to spruce and get nice and
So enticing strong like a bison
Rough like brandy and no one knows
That I got more riffs than Randy Rhodes
Smash, slash and when I trash I bash
I get ill I chill but you don't know the half
I trip I rip and though I think I'm slick
I'm nothing but a funky country hick
But I still get down with a sound that pumps
And you can hear me from the trucks and the trunks that bump
Never been questioned by the F.B.I
Although I've tried every method just to get high
L.S.D. is what I'm tripping on
And O.E. bitch is what I'm sipping on
A big fat booty's what I'm gripping on
But for now I'm going to rock and keep ripping on
Down to the mother fucking A.M
As I co bump and jump and keep the crowd in mayhem
No brain no pain...
Now come on y'all and tell me what's my name?

[Chorus][x3]
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Come On, Come On
What's My Name
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Sing that shit
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Uhh I said what's my name?
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Now break it down like this

[Verse 2]
3 sheets 2 the wind is the state I'm in
Half off the wagon with my feet dragging
Tagging hoes getting lots of trim
Getting jocks and props for all the spots I rock
I'm true I'm blue like Captain Kangaroo
And for the few who knew you I'm a bang for you
Because the Kid Rock isn't no bitch yo
And I am not no radio want to get rich ho
So count my props you can't get with me
And fuck all you cops you aren't shit to me
But hoes with guns playin hard for fun
So stay off my dick because I ain't the one
For anyone tryin to bust me up
You better chill with that tryin to fuck me up
And if you're talking shit I'm gonna shut you up
And all ya wack D.J.'s I'm gonna cut ya up
Because I don't give a fuck about no one
And when I wax, I tax and that's just how it goes son
'Cause I ain't no sucker
Because I'm the Kid.. Rock motherfucker
Straight from Motown and I won't slow down
I cease the cheese M.C.'s I mow down
And I show no shame because I'm down for mine
Now tell me what's my name?

[Chorus][x3]
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Come on bitch
What's my name
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Come on, come on
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Uhh I said what's my name
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock
