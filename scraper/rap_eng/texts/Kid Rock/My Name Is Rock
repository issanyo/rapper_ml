[Verse 1]
Fly with new blast, get gas
Kid Rock some folks thought i'd flew right past
Faded fast, ran outta gas
Here i come again, all back in that ass
No questions, i tell no lies
Rely Kid Rock is on the rise
Like a sky scraper
I'm back like smack, and so are the vapors
And the papers, cause i'm gonna rhyme
Right, jump right back up into the lime light
And i'm racking my brain where the pain was
No i got more soul than the train does
Mid western funking car pumping from the amps in the trunking
Ya can't stop this boy, this time
I'm the real macoy
And you know My name is Rock

[Chorus]
You know My name is Rock [7x]

[Verse 2]
So hey punk, feel the funk
Feel the wrath of the rock
Non stop, i got a Glock in my pants
I don't dance, i sit around
I don't sip 40's, i pound
I been around too long, coming too strong
Kid Rock got it going on
See me, see you, see through, emcee's who knew
Fly like the wind, i hang like a hinge
Been gone like rhymes on a drinking binge
So don't cringe at the sight of Rock
Ya want to fight the rock, ya gotta fight this Glock
And you can say my beats are fake
But it don't mean shit when your getting paid
Hip-Hop, the jam don't stop

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm the D to the O, P to the D
O to the straight up G see
I been around like Jesus laying tracks
But i had to come back, i had to come back
Back from the dead, enough said
Still tripping like Fred
Be red, ya got a head full of holes
I got a head full of bowls
I'm the K-I straight from the D, punk
From the home of the B funk
It is no fronting here, i won't disappear
I'll be around next year
I'm the Jiffymack
In the rack, writing off for some ify crack
Last year, this year it's all the same
But you know my name is Rock
You know My name is Rock [8x]
K-I-D's the name
