Haha

Oh I'm back [back]
The fog has lifted
The earth has shifted
And raised the gifted
You knew I'd be back
So pack your bone
And hit the road Jack
Cause daddy's home
With the funky hot riffs
Thick like Al Roker
Pumpin out hits
Gettin chips like Oprah
Bitch I told you
Do not hate
Or question the music I make

Uh
I make punk rock
And I mix it with the hip hop
I get you higher than a tree top
You wanna roll with the Kid Rock
I make Southern Rock
And I mix it with the hip hop
I got money like Fort Knox
I'll forever be a Kid Rock
Forever

The junkies are still cigar puffin'
Still the same cause I ain't changed nothing
Huffin' and puffin'
I got you rookies
All in check doin' the redneck boogie
The king is back to retract the whack
Repacked my sack with a double fat back
Forget all that I'm still singin'
And like kids on monkey bars I'm still swingin'
Thought I got dusty
Thought I'd get rusty
Thought I'd get rich and quit
Oh he must be
Fat and ugly
Broke black and blue
But I'm trim, fit, rich, and I'm back for round two
Red, white and the pabst blue ribbon
Dead right that's how I'm livin
Givin' you more then the frauds and fakes
They can't make the kind of music I make
Uh Uh

I make punk rock
And I mix it with the hip hop
I get you higher than a tree top
You wanna roll with the Kid Rock
I make southern rock
And I mix it with the hop hop
I got money like Fort Knox
I'll forever be the Kid Rock
Forever

The black hat is back in original form
The ledgible, creditable, inevitable storm
Way past the norm, still misbehavin'
Finger in the air and the flag still wavin'
Young crone don't test the boss
Cause I got this sewn like Betsy Ross
You can floss and front
You can taunt and tease
But you can't fuck with rhymes like these
Thumpin' like a drum kit
With riffs that split picks
Pumpin' for the kids who twist spliffs and sip fifths
I got the gift I'm about to unwrap it
[8 ball side pocket]
8 ball in my jacket

Pussy and blow you know how I live
Can't say that Kid
Fuck off, I just did
Watch me twirl like Earl the pearl
Or just keep on Kid Rockin' in the free world

Punk rock
And I mix it with the hip hop
I get you higher than a tree top
You wanna roll with the Kid Rock
I make southern rock
And I mix it with the hip hop
I got money like Fort Knox
I'll forever be the Kid Rock

Forever
Punk rock
Forever
Hip Hop
Forever
Southern rock
Forever
Kid Rock. [x2]
