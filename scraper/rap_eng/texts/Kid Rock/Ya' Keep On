[Verse 1]
Pass that dang coat boy I'm back
My name's not Jack Tripper, but I'm a day tripper
So watch me rip another funky rhyme
East side swingin' with the Boone's wine
Getting mine, just like I'm supposed to
And if you fuck with the Rock, I'll roast you
A little toast to the real emcee's
Ain't no love for the wanna be's
So, hey ho, don't call me Joe
Cause the Joe's I know can't even flow
I can battle rap, and all that other crap
So if ya don't want none, better step to the back
I'm from the mother fuckin' ole school
Basement parties in the Clem fool
Talking that trash, I wish you would
Come step to Rock, it's all good

[Chorus]
Ya keep on, ya keep on
Ya keep on, ya keep on

[Verse 2]
Now it's the Marlboro smokin', fine ho pokin'
Kind buds, be the bud's I'm toking
Hitting you saps with the fresh shit
Midwestern funk, and I'm the best bitch
The K to the I to the chrome D's
In the Grand Marquis sipping O-E
Pimping Rock, it's my name, my game
Serving you ho's like it ain't no thing
I'm the Kid when I rap, Rock when I'm singing
I don't care who comes, but what the fuck you bringin'?
Shit, one time, one rhyme
Cause I'm that motherfucking ill one, with a steel dick
Hitting you ho's with the real shit

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now if you don't know ho, I'm the man in the dark
I got more riffs than Stanley Clarke
Or George Duke, shoot, I'm the kid with the funky loops
So if ya want some, get some
If ya need some, here's some
If ya don't just step to the rear son
I'm coming with the quickness
If you dis this bitch, you'll wind up on my hit list
I'll put a bounty on your head
Macomb County bitch, ain't a good place to wind up dead
Cause I'm a real relevant, elephant-type menace
But it is not Rocky Dennis
Watch me bang this rhyme in half
I'm like Moses, but the mic is my staff
Laying down them 10 commandments
Tho shall not dis the Rock God dammit

[Chorus][X2]
