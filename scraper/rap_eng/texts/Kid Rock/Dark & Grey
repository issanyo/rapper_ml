[Verse 1]
1994
Fuck Off
Unlike me you're going to run away
Unlike me you'll see another day
Run like me out on the highway
I will ride so far
I'll probably never make it there

I never went to college
I am not got no skills
I got hair to my shoulders
And a bottle of pills
I got bills stacked up
Like a turkey club
I blew my last dime drinkin
At the local pub

[Chorus]
I am not sunshine
I am dark and grey
For this life of sins
I live, each day I pay
I am not Jesus
But I died in vein
Only to relive each day of pain

Unlike me you're going to run away
Unlike me you'll see another day
Run like me, out on the highway
I will ride so far
I'll probably never make it there

[Bridge]
Rock rock y'all
To the beat y'all
Check it out y'all
You can't stop y'all
Rock rock y'all
To the beat y'all
Check it out y'all
You come alive y'all
Come on

[Verse 2]
I never felt at home
Although I grew up loved
I got a junkies mind
And a rambling man's blood
Got a flood full of thoughts
That's caught in a dam
Some days I'm gone
But that's where I am
I'm fit to slip
Another ripping rhyme
Im so ahead of the game
I feel left behind
Another dime to boost
I got boots of lead
Hope I live to see
This Virus spread

[Chorus]
I am not sunshine
I am dark and grey
For this life of sins
I live, each day I pay
I am not Jesus
But I died in vein
Only to relive each day of pain

Unlike me you're going to run away
Unlike me you'll see another day
Run like me, out on the highway
I will ride so far
I'll probably never make it there
