[Verse 1]
In the hustle and grind, working 9 to 9
Losing my mind, watching Father TIme
It's the same ole same, this ball and chain
With only one day to ease my pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Because Monday's just a bitch
Tuesday's such a bother
Wednesday's like watching dead flowers grow
Thursday ain't for shit
Friday's getting hotter
But on Saturday night you know
We let it rock
And keep the drinks pouring
We let it roll

[Chorus]
Until the early morning
We're underpaid, but we still give tanks and praise
God bless Saturday

[Verse 2]
They tell me I'm living the American dream
Just working for the man
But 52 hours in a stamping plant
Sometimes I don't understand

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
