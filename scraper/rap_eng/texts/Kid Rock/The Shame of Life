I love the girls and the money and the shame of life
My shallow mind is just a sign of your game of life
There were girls in the front
There were girls in the back
And there were girls pettin' squirrels
And there were squirrels smokin' crack
With an old Navy Seal and the DEA
And a loaded automatic just to blow me all away
With a dog drinkin' liquor from a hole in the sky
And a picture of a pitcher throwin' pitches at a guy
He had a problem with his sister and her 3D cups
And a brother with a shovel just to shake it all up

I love the girls and the money and the shame of life
Hop down they're the people on the street
Where the fuzz in the navel make the people want to eat
My shallow mind is just a sign of your game of life
Get found at the level of the rest
Where the people on the street put their mettle to the test

Locomotive individual and a knuckle in a fight
And I was hidin' in the bushes but I couldn't stand the light
And he was highly indisputable the leader of the gang
Like a bullet in the freezer - Bang Bang

I love the girls and the money and the shame of life
Hop down they're the people on the street
Where the fuzz in the navel make the people want to eat
My shallow mind is just a sign of your game of life
Get found at the level of the rest
Where the people on the street put their mettle to the test

Get down - get down get get dow dow dow down
Invisibility is a relative thing
Hah hah hah ha ha ha ha ha

I was all shaken up after I got shaken down
I was shakin' in the air
And I was shakin' on the ground
I was taken by the shaker who was preachin' to the crew
He was shakin' lots of bacon cookin' egg in his shoe
And awaken all the stereos began to sing a tune
Told us we were just a vision in a dream about a shoe
That was walkin' through a store
To find a needle for a soul
That had lost a little reason
Through a little tiny hole

I love the girls and the money and the shame of life
Hop down they're the people on the street
Where the fuzz in the navel make the people want to eat
My shallow mind is just a sign of your game of life
Get found at the level of the rest
Where the people on the street put their mettle to the test
I love the girls and the money and the shame of life
Hop down they're the people on the street
Where the fuzz in the navel make the people want to eat
My shallow mind is just a sign of your game of life
Get found at the level of the rest
Where the people on the street put their mettle to the test

Stay, stay, my darling
Someday this will all be over
More than anything, or anyone, you will ever know
