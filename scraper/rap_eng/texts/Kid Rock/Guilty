I turned my 15 minutes into 10 long years
I made a million just from drinking beers
I got a jet just from touching these frets
So if my ego gets out of check

I guess I'm guilty
Uh uh uh
I said I'm guilty

I might do a little yak
Might have run my trap
Now and then get into a scrap
That's alright I got lawyers for that
And them motherfuckers

They even know that I'm guilty
Uh uh uh
I said I'm guilty

I never sweat rarely feel regret
The cameras roll when you least expect
Some of the times ended up online
And motherfucker, if that's a crime

I guess I'm.......guilty

I know agreement shit ain't bindin'
You catch me on your charts still cliimbin'
Big big NASCAR ring shinin'
I'm sellin' goin' platinum picture with diamonds
I been rhymin' signin' check it out
I been climbin' fly me to all about
Where you at? I been here for years. "Come On"
Every little body let Southfield know

I'm guilty
Come on I'm guilty
Southfield know I'm guilty
Yes I am
