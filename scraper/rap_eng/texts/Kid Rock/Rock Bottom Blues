[Verse 1]
A moonshine shuffle in a crowded space
A hog-tied hustle with a driving bass
Some full throttle, half bottle, high saddle rhythm and blues
Come on now try it, this muddy water's feeling fine
You can't deny it, foot-stomping music and wine

[Chorus]
It feels good to me (answer)[X2]
It feels good to me (tell the truth)
It feels good to me (threw and threw)
It feels good to me now, I hope it feels good to you!

[Verse 2]
A smoke filled fever in a low-lit room
A pocket full of pain and a bag of doom
Some high cotton, fat bottom, bad rocking hundred proof
Come on now try it, it's bound to make ya lose your mind
You can't deny it, foot-stomping music and wine

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
A big bonfire in an open field
Some good timing women s like Riley Steele
Forget tomorrow
Tonight we gonna raise the roof
Come on now try it, because these are those good times
You can't deny it, foot-stomping music and wine

[Chorus]

These non-stop, last-drop, hi-watt, rock bottom blues
