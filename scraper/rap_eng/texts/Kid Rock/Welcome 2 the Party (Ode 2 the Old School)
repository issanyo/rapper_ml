[Intro]
It ain't nothing but a party here
From the early evening til the break of day
So step this way and let your mind be free
And by the way... "welcome to the party"

[Verse 1: Kid Rock]
Well my name's Kid Rock I'm a Capricorn
Detroit's city where I was born
When I was young I knew I'd always be
A super live body rockin' MC
I'm T-N-T I'm dynamite
And I'm gonna rock this party all damn night
I've got the gift of gab I can walk the walk
I became an emcee when I learned to talk
Sayin' goo-goo ga-ga
I gotta lotta time to eat MC's like pirhanas
I'm a pro at this, yeah the ultimate
Cause I don't spit, my rap too quick
I'm the ladies pick all around the world
But I only got eyes for just one girl
I don't roll twirl like a ballerina
I roll through towns and I rock arenas
I may seem a little under age
But at least I am not under paid
I'm one of kind here to shock your mind
And I will serve no rhymes before their time
The K-K-Kid Rock, that is my name
And if you ask me again, I'll tell you the same
Who's to blame I don't really know
But my game's so tight I think I'm gonna go pro
So here we go here here we go
I'm gonna rock it up high, then rock it down low
From the floor to the ceiling to the living room
Cause people like to hear my bass go boom boom boom ba boom
The one two three the three two one
Don't stop me know I've just begun
Don't cut me down don't start no fight
Or I'll put my foot in your ass tonight
I'm outta sight, like the planet Mars
And when I set my sights I shoot for stars
I don't like small cars or real big women
But somehow I always find myself in 'em
I'm a hidden gem, a rollin' stone
I'm a one man band with a microphone
Here to make you shake and move your body
So come on in and welcome to the party

[Hook]
It ain't nothing but a party hey
From the early evening to the break of day
So step this way and let your mind be free
And by the way welcome to the party

[Interlude]
Uh uh excuse me Mr. Kid Rock can I do my thing Can I have a
Little something to say right here?
(Oh yeah go ahead baby)

[Verse 2: Unknown]
I'm a real live show and you can watch me throw
I'm the M to the L and I'll let ya know
Alize is too sweet and it'll make ya fat
I've got a pound of dank and a gallon of cognac
I'm all of that and a bag of chips
{Fuck} it, I'm the whole damn party mix
I'm the chick that doesn't seem all too classy
You can't party with me but you can kiss my *Whistle*

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Hey Grand-master Bob that old school shit's fresh
But uh let's rock some of that fuckin' 1998 Kid Rock shit bro

[Verse 3: Kid Rock]
I'm an Irish lad, but don't call me Clancy
I'm gonna rock it for Dixie to suit your fancy
Rock your pants off and party my dick off
People want to know when's the tour gonna kick off
I'm no rip-off , it's all original
Not too political...a little cynical
About the fakes and squakers that talk a lot of ca-ca
I know a lot of chicks that like to call me poppa
Don't start drama...mack in the bahamas
Rock on the dance floor to din dada
Cause I'm a player that you love to hate
Got your girl suckin' dick on video tape
I like pussy...suckin' on titties
Fucked a lot of different bitches from a bunch of different cities
Kid Rock and I'm the same old fool
I'll tell ya to drop your boyfriend then drop outta high school
I got a whirlpool...don't even ask
Lickin' pussy underwater shootin' bubbles up your ass
I'm so crass that I'm the last of my kind
Me, Slick Willie in the DC Shrine
Sometimes I rhyme just for kicks
Forget the bullshit and bust like this
I don't steal from the rich and give to the poor
I take from my bitches from give it to my whores
What up I'm saying everybody
You get fucked up and I'll rock the party

Rock the party(8x)
