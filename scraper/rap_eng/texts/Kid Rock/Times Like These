[Verse 1]
The lakes and pines they bleed of beauty and grace
And the rivers they run wild like an endless race
The forests soar so high then fall to the sea
As church bells ring and sing in harmony

[Pre-Chorus]
I heard them say they're shutting Detroit down
But I won't leave because this is my hometown

[Chorus]
And it's times like these we can't replace
It's times like these we must embrace
And even though it's bittersweet and brings us to our knees
It makes us who we are, in times like these

[Verse 2]
The concrete and steel stand strong against the wind
With the memories of what was and what has been
The sounds of sweet soul music and blue-collar blues
There were 17 colors for a Chevy all red white and blue

[Pre-Chorus]
I heard them say that you can't save that town
But I won't leave, I will stand my ground

[Chorus]
And it's times like these we can't replace
It's times like these we must embrace
And even though it's bittersweet and brings us to our knees
It makes us who we are, in times like these

[Verse 3]
The ice and snow give way to a new spring bloom
In the wake that hope and faith they will be home soon
A new day dawns as the good Lord shines from above
Because in the rubble and rust there remains a whole lotta love

[Bridge]
And I was here watching it all go down
And I'll still be, when it comes back around

[Outro]
And it's times like these we can't replace
It's times like these we must embrace
And even though it's bittersweet and brings us to our knees
It makes us who we are, in times like these[x2]
