[Verse]
Who are you, who are you?
Well I'm the punk with the pump in the back of my ride
How you step Rock? I step in stride
I pimp across stage with my nuts in my hand
The punks wanna front cause I got my own band
Goddamn I'm the man with the helly buzz
And my shit don't stink, like Kelly's does
But Kelly's your girl, man, from what I heard
Nah man, I kicked that bitch to the curb
I don't really need to be tied down
I'm a rambling man, and I'm platinum bound
Me too, hold my brew, I thought you knew
.16 is what I blew
I bet that set you straight, that illegal act
Fuck that, I still roll with a 40 in my lap
Back in 2nd grade, I carried a lunch box
Turned 21 started smoking crack rocks
Snorting that D by the dime
Wish I could slow down, I'm ahead of my time
I'm the Krack, I'm the Krack
Krack, Krack, Krack
I'm the Krack bitch, my last dime's what I'm betting
I'm up in the casino with the fresh flat Stetson
Girls all stare, they gawk, they sneer
So I grab me a bitch and I step the the rear
My living room is the place I'm hanging out
Young, tight pussies is the shit I'm banging out
I'm sick of living in these perplexed times
That's why I kick these motherfucking sex rhymes
I'm heading down south[X2]
I'm heading down, heading down
Hip hip hip hip digging exactly where you go
I'm heading down south on a dusty path
I got a cool ass buzz and an empty flask
Ass on the wagon and they think I'm all soft
But I don't give a fuck, I'm tripping my balls off
Up in the crack house, coolin' at Rock's house
Ho's come around an we be knocking the box out
Knocked out, knocked up and all that shit
Hot wax, sweaty spot, licking spit from your clit
Everything that gets old It gets over rated
Old to me, just means out-dated
I'm the Kid Rock, fuck all that 60's shit
Take Woodstock and shove it up your momma's slit
Oh shit, and there it is
I get a lot of pussy cause I'm in show biz
Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
I wished for a kiss and your mom popped out
Put her hands on her flop and started eyeing me
So I smacked the ole bitch with my Flying V
That's when I said "man I gotta get a grip" and
Looked at the TV realized I was tripping

[Outro]
It is no party like a Detroit party
Cause a Detroit party don't stop
I said It is no party like a Detroit party
Cause a Detroit party don't stop
It is no party like a Detroit party
Cause a Detroit party don't stop
I said It is no party like a Detroit party
Cause a Detroit party don't stop
