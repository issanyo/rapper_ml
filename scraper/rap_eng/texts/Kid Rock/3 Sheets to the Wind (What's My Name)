I'm here and it's clear
I'm gonna flow, so yo, black
Just get on up or yo, get the bozak
'Cause it ain't Kojack or Dr. Seuss
It's the Kid motherfucker and I'm gonna get loose
'Cause I got the juice to spruce and get nice
And so enticin', strong like a bison
Rough like brandy and no one knows
That I got more riffs than Randy Rhodes
Smash, slash and when I thrash I bash
I get ill, I chill but you don't know the half
I trip I rip and though I think I'm slick
I'm nothin but a funky country hick
But I still get down with a sound that pumps
And you can hear me from the trucks and the trunks that bump
Never been questioned by the F.B.I
Although I've tried every method just to get high
L.S.D. is what I'm trippin on
And O.E. bitch is what I'm sippin on
A big fat booty's what I'm grippin on
But for now I'm gonna rock and keep rippin on
Down to the muther fuckin A.M
As I co bump and jump and keep the crowd in mayhem
No brain no pain...Now c'mon yall and tell me what's my name

Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Come On, Come On
What's My Name
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Sing that shit
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Uhh I said what's my name?
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Now break it down like this

3 sheets 2 the wind is the state I'm in
Half off the wagon with my feet draggin
Taggin hoes gettin lots of trim
Gettin jocks and props for all the spots I rock
I'm true I'm blue like Captain Kangaroo
And for the few who knew yo I'm a bang for you
Because the Kid Rock ain't no bitch yo
And I ain't no radio wanna get rich ho
So count my props you can't get with me
And fuck all u cops u ain't shit to me
But hoes with guns playin hard for fun
So stay off my dick because I ain't the one
For anyone tryin to bust
And I show no shame cuz I'm down for mine
Now tell me what's my name

Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Come on bitch
What's my name
