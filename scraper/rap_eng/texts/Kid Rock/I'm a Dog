[Verse 1]
Come on, uh
See me ride across the country with my shotty riding shotgun
Got slimmy's on my Jimmy with magnums rocking platinum
Wigs dig this, the fucking police know I see them
So I'm headed up to Reno like a geo and I'll greet 'em
Free my mind of life's inconsistencies
You got a lot but you, you can't get these
Free my mind of life's inconcistencies
I had enough and you can swing on these

[Chorus]
Because I'm a dog, baby, see me ride across the country
I'm a dog, bitch, big suitcase full of money
I'm a dog, mamma, and I'm rolling El Camino
I'm a d-d-d-dog, yeah

[Verse 2]
Drop-top continental with a suicide, see me ride
You by my side, big girl, yo, we will never die
I'll be your Hollywood eyes and send you swinging baby
Bring it home to poppa and Rock going to make it jingle baby
It's a God damn shame people they look at me
But I know in the end you give a fuck about me
That's the reason I spit fire
That's the reason I'm a set your ass on fire, fire
I should never left the bottle
And if they want the truth then tell them bitches I shot them

[Chorus]

Yeah, can ya, can you
Can you feel it now

[Verse 3]
Freedom or death, nothing left to do but fill it up
Triple X eyes of lust and you need to give it up
Live it up sucker because they're saying my days are numbered
Who wants to live long anyway
I'm going out with a blast, getting some ass
And smoking grass, leaving all my cash for my little boy
You wouldn't understand, you don't know where I come from
Hey, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
