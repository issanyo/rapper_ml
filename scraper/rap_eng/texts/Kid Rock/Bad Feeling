I got a feeling
A bad feeling
You're leaving and baby that's just got me mad
Thinking and crazy drinking
And I'm sinkin'
And I'm reachin'
For something to believe in

I feel it slippin' away
There just ain't nothin' to say
I did all I can do
Was it enough for you?
Look at what we've been through
I can't take another day

I got a feeling
A bad, bad feeling
I should be leavin'
'Cause I've been doin' nothing
Oh, lyin' while you keep on tryin'
Askin' me what is wrong
You keep holding on
Girl, I'm already gone

I feel it slippin' away
There just ain't nothin' left to say
I did all I could do
Was it enough for you?
Look at what we've been through
I can't take another day

It's gonna hurt when it's over
Oh but if I stay
One more day
I'm gonna lose my mind

I feel it slippin' away
There just ain't nothin' left to say
I did all I could do
Was it enough for you?
Look at what we've been through
I can't take another day

I got a feeling
A bad feeling
That you're leaving
