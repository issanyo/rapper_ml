[Verse 1]
I been living like a drunken sailor
Playing in a rock on roll band
Far from a failure, I feel like a brand new man
Smoking like a fiend and scheming
Dealing with the upper hand
It's been so long since I felt this good, God damn

[Chorus]
I'm finally standing tall
I feel I just can't fall
Your love takes me to a higher place

[Verse 2]
For the first time, in a long time
I'm done paying my dues
For the first time, in a long time
I don't feel used
Let's go out honky tonking
Dancing till the morning light
The time is now and this time I feel all right

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
For the first time, in a long time
I don't stand accused
For the first time, in a long time
I feel brand new
Life's been kind, water tastes like wine
I feel so high like I'm on cloud nine
For the first time, in a long time
