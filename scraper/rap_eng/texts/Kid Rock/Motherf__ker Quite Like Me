Yep
I've been on the cover of the rolling stone
I met the president when i was half stoned
I been so high i've gotten confused
I been beat down, broke and used

Motherfucker
I drank with hank, talked blues with billy
Rocked with run sang with shotgun willy
Went from small time philly to big time bobby
From 3 day old chili to saki with wosabi

I'm home hey i'm home
You never met a motherfucker quite like me
Not like me, dida dada like me, hey like me

No more bein' poured drink specials at winners
Or being ignored by the think straight sinners
I used to smoke pinners while my moms made dinner
Now i smoke bombs and rock with lynyrd skynyrd

No beginners here i'm a seasoned vet
Educated on jazz by my man amed
Heard again my friend i been the world n back
But i'm michigan boy can you feel that

And i'm home
You never met a motherfucker quite like me
Not like me, god damn like me, hey hey like me

Never thought i'd go as far in life as this
Never made par and i could give 2 shits
Never wanted sell cars cause my dad was a dick
Never wanted a guitar 'till i heard a lick like this

And from the depths of dixie to my northern spots
You know its time to rock when ole glory drops

I pimp through town with the top laid back
Black hat, fine blonde, cold pabst in my lap
I'll adapt
To any and all situations

That's why the call me the pimp of the nation
Hey bitch you best believe i live in the woods not your world of greed
Might, a little weed might a little yeah
I'm so proud to be living in the usa

You've never met a motherfucker quite like me
Hey hey like me, da di da da stay like me, hey hey hey like me
You ain't ever met and you ain't never going meet

You never met a ,never met a ,never never never never met a
Motherfucker quite like me
You ain't never met a mother like me
Hey you ain't never never never never never met someone like me

(hey hey)
Never met like me
(hey hey)
(hey dude hey)
Never met a mother like me
(come on, hey)

And you never, and never gonna never gonna meeeeeet
(hey come on already)
You never meeeeeeeet

What?
(dude, theres more to life that just you)
Hahaha
