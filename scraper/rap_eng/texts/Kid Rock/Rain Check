[Intro]
You know how it is
Some guys just got to make time to get their rocks off no matter what
I'm like that

[Verse 1]
Tearing up pussy every where I go
I'm Kid mother fuckin Rock so what's up ho?
You want to get fucked by a big dick that dangles?
Then drop your funky drawers straight down to your ankles
And swing that big ass in my direction
For a little safe sex , V.D. inspection
Because though I'm mackin' ho's like Charles Bronson
I'm learning real quick got to wrap my Johnson
But just in case I hope you're on the pill
Because I been known to ride a pussy like bad boy Bill
And I'd hate to spill, or raise the stakes
I'm nutting all up in your shit if my rubber breaks
Now my dick rocks when I'm licking all that gin
So spread your funky legs and let the games begin
Wait, hold up bitch, say what's with the bad cough?
I'll see you 'round the way, I think I'm going to go jack off
