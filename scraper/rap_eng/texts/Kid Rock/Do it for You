[Verse 1]
Been sitting alone
Thinking about the past
Another lonely night
Another empty glass
This path i'm walking
Always seems to lead no where
I wonder how much you think of me
How we used to laugh
How we used to be
It seems like freedom
Has never had a man so scared

[Chorus]
Times might change
Love it comes and goes
How i wish i could have shown you
How deep for you my love goes
And i know this might seem crazy
I would end my life for you
You know i don't want to
But id do it for you
Hey id do it for you
I wonder how much you think of me
It hurts to think the past
Is all that you can see
Now it seems like freedom
Is better then the love we shared

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Listen to me
I wonder how long it takes to see
There's nothing more i want
Then you here with me
Freedoms been knocking
But i refuse to let her in

[Chorus]
Times may change
Love it comes and goes
How i wish i would have shown you
How deep for you my love goes
And i know this might sound crazy
I would end my life for you
You know i want to
Come back home and care for you
Baby id do anything for you
Id do anything for you
