[Verse]
Smoking any thing that I can fit in a pipe
Slamming bottles of tussing and going fishing for pike
Never uptight my high won't permit it
My problem's life but I don't sweat it, just live it
And I'm not your average rapper
Got the same birth date as Thomas Crapper
So bitch better watch your back
Because I push more power than a Marshall stack
Never the wack but oh so pesky
Some say I can't flow but muther fucker don't test me
And if you arrest me you dumb cop
I'll find your daughter and I'll give her this cock
Kid Rock's my mother fuckin name
Bitch u know me so pass the O.E
And don't talk about takin me out
Because I got your girl and I'm making her shout
Just like a piano I'm really grand
And I got more riffs than Steely Dan
Some friends call me fly
But most just call me when they want to get high
It is't the disco Cisco Kid mother fucker
It's the outlasting shotgun-blasting
Dick-swinging pussy licking punk
Little skinny muther fucker and I'm not no hunk
But I got more rhymes than a cornfield stalks
And I turn more tricks than Tony Hawk
Walk with a limp because I pimp like a pro
And if you dis me punk I'll fuck your ho
And though you think I'm nothing more than a young punk
I'm like a hound dog chasing a chipmunk
I move quick like a cheetah
And it isn't shit to me to just beat a
M.C. down who looks like a dick
Jumping around like a homo on a pogo stick
Yo rock, What's up stop being a jerk
And just "Give them an example of how a D.J. works"
Because it's blackjack and I got two aces
Been many places seen many faces
And everywhere I go people want to jive
So I keep my fingers on my 45
So don't cross my dusty path
Or I'll put my foot up in crusty ass
Don't front ho pass the jay
Then hear me M.C. and watch me D.J
To the beat y'all and I won't stop
And I'm going to rock this shit till your eardrums pop
Everybody's trying to get a piece of the pie
But I don't let bullshit spoil my high
