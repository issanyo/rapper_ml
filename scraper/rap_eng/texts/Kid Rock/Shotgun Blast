[Verse]
Ah, shit!
Kid Rock back in this motherfucking house
Feel the effects of my shotgun blast
Mothers crying from theses shotgun blasts
Feel the effects of my shotgun blast
People dying from theses shotgun blasts
Cause I'm ripping, flipping, cripping, like a real one does
So if your rap's wrapped in jack, sweep it under the rug
Cause I'm a go above that, beyond the calls of my fucking duty
Cause all theses corney, foney emcee's now a days don't move me
So I'm a show it proof G, so make waves
I got a full time pay, stat to dig graves
Because I'm burrying emcee's, and sharin their lady's
Now you rolled ho's are carrying my babies
Grab me it never hurt no one
A broken home always hurts someone
Grab me it never hurt no one
I saw kid's get shot, don't sell guns
And still i rip it, flip it, grip it like a real one does
Rocking, shocking on the stage, with a hella steady buzz
From a 5th of ole Jimmy Beam
We frying emcee's up just like some motherfucking Jimmy Dean
Sausage patty's, and smoking cabbies like it's no thing
Drinking more Colt's then the 45 king
Swinging emcee's like a cow hands rope
And if the guns too loud, oh boy, i'm straight slitting throats
Cause that's the way I like to do shit Holmes
Every time I get my gamble on
Yeah that's the way i like to do shit Holmes
I never stay in one spot, i was born to roam
Feel like i got bank, but it's not enough friend
Cause i want more bank see, than my grand-kids could ever spend
So if ya need some cheep slut, then speak up
Most ho's know not to ask for cash, cause i'm a cheep fuck

[Outro]
Feel the effects of my shotgun blast
Mothers crying from theses shotgun blasts
Feel the effects of my shotgun blast
People dying from theses shotgun blasts
