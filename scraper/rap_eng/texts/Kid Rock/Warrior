[Verse 1]
Warrior
Yeah
So don't tell me who's wrong or right when liberty starts slipping away
And if you aren't going to fight
Get out of the way
Because freedom isn't so free when breathe red, white, and blue
I'm giving all of myself
Well how bout you

[Chorus]
And they call me warrior
They call me loyalty
And they call me ready to go
Believe and help whenever you need me to be
I'm an American warrior
I'm an American warrior
A citizen soldier, ohh

[Verse 2]
Citizen soldier [echo]
I never leave another behind
And I will never accept defeat
I'm a soldier in war
Civilian in peace
Because freedom isn't so free
When you breathe red, white, and blue
I'm giving all of myself
Because that's what I do

[Chorus]
