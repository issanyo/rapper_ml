[Intro]
Bitch

[Chorus]
Where you at Rock, where you at

[Verse 1]
Beep
You fucking ass fucking hole
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
Where the fuck are you
You fucking love me?
Yeah mother fucking right
Where the fuck are you? What are you doing?
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
Fucking some groupie bitch
Goodbye
Fuck Off
You know what I hope your fucking dick fucking falls off
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
And when it does, maybe you'll have some mother fucking time for me
You fucking asshole
Don't call me no more
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
Don't call
Don't beg
Don't call
Nothing at all, bye

[Chorus]
(Where you at Rock, where you at)

[Verse 2]
Beep
Yo Rock it's Carp
Ahh where you at man?
It's about 3 o'clock here in New York
I guess it's about 8 o'clock in London
Ahh your supposed to be at Abby Road finishing lyrics
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
I just got a call from one of these guys and he mentioned that you would
Ahh that you were thinking about going to Amsterdam
Which I just wanted to let you know that if you were pondering that
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
That it is not a good idea
We have matchering in three days
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
Ahh just remind you
I'm at the office, see you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Beep
Where you at rock, where you at
Bobby where are you?
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
It's Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock
You know I did ask you to be at 3
You promised me you'd be here
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
Were having a special party for the whole family
It's Father's Day and I'm really upset
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
You know, we planned this whole thing around you
Well Father's Day was the other day and yet you couldn't make it
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
So we made this whole party around you
Now where the hell are you?
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
I'm really gettin a little heated
Please call me right back, now

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Answering Machine: Beep
Rock, it's Kracker
What the fuck are you doing?
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
I'm at the Tellstar
This ghetto ass fucking place with four smoking ass three bitches
Ready to turn them the fuck out
You were supposed to be here forty minutes ago
What the fuck are you doin?
Ah call me back ah...

[The phone is picked up by Kid Rock]

Yo, Yo, Yo
Hey
Hey
What the fuck are you doing?
Yo, yo, I'll be right, I'll be right there
Peace

[Verse 5]
Uh, I grew a herding cattle
I got more rhymes than heroin in Seattle
You want to battle with the Rock quit frontin
I'll spit on your ass and then tell you that you arn't nothing
Grab your honey and your beer and I'll break South
Take your money then I'll tell ya get the hell out
I'll put your head out, this is my night
How you going to step with Rock when I got the mic
I shot the sheriff and the deputy too
Paid off the feds now its all about my crew
What you hoes want to do
One at a time or all at once I'll still roll through your whole crew
Like a south bound trucker
Hoss and mother fuckers take shorts
Mother fuckers take a loss
And when you step with your anger
I'm like the robot from lost in space (Danger Danger)
I give a warning but if you don't take it
I'll put my arm around your neck like we're cool then I'll break it
It's all real cop a feel from my steel
Here's the deal when I say clap your hands like a seal
Or better yet give respect where it's earned
You'll eat me up I'm like a hot pepper and you might get burned
You took a turn for the worst
Walked up in my face rode away in a hurse
Now how you going to front on that
Kid Rock's in the house that's where I'm at

[Chorus]
Where you at Rock, where you at
Over here to the rear with your girl the fourties of beer
Where you at Rock, where you at
Over there with the bad attitude cause I just don't care
Where you at Rock, where you at, Uh
Where you at Rock, where you at

One-two and it don't stop
Three-Four and it don't quit
One-two and it don't stop

[Verse 2]
From the depths of hell to God's right hand side
I'm what's left of the get paid, self made pride
I'll step in stride, I'm raw as cow hide
My first LP is still selling that isn't no Jive
Am I the chosen one
Some people aren't getting where I'm coming from
Or where I'm going to stand back
Kid Rock's in the house that's where I'm at

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And I'll be the long haired wizard with the lazy eye
Ask the ladies and they'll tell you that I'm crazy fly
I'm stepping to the mic like a soldier bro
I hate to sound like a dick but I told ya so ho
Old Crow and a soul full of desperation
I'm rockin up on the mic with no consideration
For you're church or you're family
Ayn Rand couldn't stand me so she banned me
I'm like a dandy lion Jack
You can cut me down and then I'll pop right back
And attack from the back like a great white
I'm not down with the scrappin but I'm down for the gun fight
Behind my back talkin shit
But when I front your ass you wanna act like a little bitch
Keep on and get your ass macked
Kid Rock's in the house that's where I'm at

[Chorus][x2]

Where you at Rock, where you at
Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh
Where you at Rock, where you at
Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh
Where you at Rock, where you at
Over here, Over here, Uh, Over Here
Where you at Rock, where you at
Over there with the bad attitude because I just don't care
Where you at Rock, where you at
