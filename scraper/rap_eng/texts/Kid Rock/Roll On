[Intro]
I love it when you play it like that
Come on, play

[Verse 1]
Sitting here alone I'm looking back on where I've roamed
And laughing how I swore I'd win and not get burned
Left my family
Left my home
I worked my fingers to the bone
And there was not a stone I did not leave unturned
And I was having a good time

[Chorus]
Roll on Roll on Roller Coaster
We're one day older and one step closer
Roll on there's mountains to climb
Roll on we're on borrowed time
Roll on Roller coaster
Roll on tonight
Roll on tonight yeah

[Verse 2]
Money and success
I don't complain about the stress
I wanted this and now it's here
So I don't bitch
And I swear that time's a trick
It disappears in oh so quick
Man I was just sixteen
And now I'm staring at thirty-six
But I'm still having a good time

[Chorus]
Roll on Roll on Roller Coaster
We're one day older and one step closer
Roll on there's mountains to climb
Roll on we're on borrowed time
Roll on Roller coaster
Roll on tonight
Roll on tonight
And I know it's hard to see with the sun in your eyes
But one day you're going to say I saw the light

[Verse 3]
And now heading for the hill
And I just cannot wait until
My children grow up to have children of their own
And I'll be telling them about
The times I turned the party out
And how I stood against an army all alone
Drinking wine and staying high
And realized it couldn't last
And how I turned myself around
And went down another path
And the signs we must observe
When life's changes do occur
But most of all I'll tell them
Just how proud I am of them
And always have a good time
It's all the love and good times
Let's all have a good time, yeah

[Chorus]
Roll on Roll on Roller Coaster
We're one day older and one step closer
Roll on there's mountains to climb
Roll on we're on borrowed time
Roll on Roller coaster
Roll on tonight (roll on tonight, roll on tonight)
Roll on tonight (just roll, roll baby, roll baby)
Roll on tonight (hey woo hooh)
Roll on, roll on
I want you to roll
Roll with me babe
Roll with me babe
Roll with me every time
Hey

[Chorus]
Roll on Roll on Roller Coaster
We're one day older and one step closer
Roll on there's mountains to climb
Roll on we're on borrowed time
Roll on Roll on Roller Coaster
We're one day older and one step closer
Roll on there's mountains to climb
Roll on we're on borrowed time

[Outro]
Roll on Roll on Roller Coaster
We're one day older and one step closer
