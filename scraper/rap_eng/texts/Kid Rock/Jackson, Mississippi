[Verse 1]
And when the sunshine showed
Her face i felt like i was ready to die
Went lookin for a place to hide
A hole i could crawl inside
Long lines
Whiskey bottles
And the same old song
I smell death in the air
And i know it won't be long

And i could say im trying to change
But thats just another lie
Its been a day and a half
And i'm still high

[Verse 2]
And i feel like jackson mississippi
A river running
Like jackson mississippi
A river running
Like jackson mississippi
A river running threw my veins

And when the daylight dissapeared
I took a good look inside
Behind my pride
I sat down and cried
I know im not a fool
But i dont know whats wrong
Mabe its time to pack
And just move on

[Outro]
And i could say im trying to change
But that would just be a lie
Im looking for some one to tell me why
