[Introduction]
Everything's tight from my loot to my friends
I ain't got time to tighten up loose ends HUH
I've been that route too many times
If I ain't stabbed in the back I ain't fightin' no crime
I wish for that which my heart holds near
But ain't nobody playin' what I'm tryin' to hear
I've been sayin' for years that the fakes wouldn't last
You were jockin' that bullshit, now you look like an ass

[Verse 1: Kid Rock]
Get gassed in your garage of sickness
As I bring a little swing into your world of stiffness
Cause I've got plenty of rhymes to spill
Ain't got nothin' more than time to kill
Form like a blister, drink like a failure
Rip like a twister right through a trailer
Park after dark is when you'll see me comin'
My gun's gunnin' and the 808's hummin'
Raw Raw Rip Rock Rude
Sample anything I like and never get sued
At 18 I had a hardcore attitude
When I turned 19 I was touring with Ice Cube
It's true I broke the old school
Where the rules don't bend and the beats don't end
No place to be I gotta let these knuckles know who the fuck I be
I'm still the (I'm still body rockin' DP MC)
So clap your hands to what he's doing
I'm a razor blade slittin' through a wrist of hate
I'm a contradiction I'm a twist of fate

[Chorus]
See me rollin'
You got me rollin'
I'm rollin'
Searchin' underneath the sun

[Verse 2: Kid Rock]
I'm dead as shit, but I ain't been killed
See I'm a Mack, I'm a truck, but I'm Peter built
I am the Trucker and my ego's large
I'm the K to the I call me sarge
Roll number seven raise south of heaven
See my crew comin' hear them Harley's revin'
I'm steppin' to your crew with a glick of hits
Got 3 LP's but I ain't got no hits
And I'm a greatful, hateful, little son of a G
I'm a deadhead runnin' from the D-P-D
Got soul so plagued with the rhythms cancer
Grab a pole and you'll be swingin' like a topless dancer
Biltmore Beavers and a Top Dog Coat
Top car 4 Vogues on a hundred spokes
Got a roundtrip ticket to the promised land
If it ain't all that i'll be back my man

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge]
Days roll by they roll too fast
I said days roll by I watch them pass

Yeah you wanna roll with Rock
And party with crews that just don't stop uh huh

[Chorus]

Searching undearneath the sun
Searching undearneath the sun
Searching undearneath the sun
