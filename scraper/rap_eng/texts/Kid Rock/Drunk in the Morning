[Verse 1]
I want to make money to take away my problems
But my problems get bigger with the more money I make
I want to find love, but that's my problem
Because the money makes it hard to tell the real from fake
I wanna spend time with my son, oh, every hour
But the money and the problems and the women keep me away
I want to be happy for just one hour
But the only time I'm happy anymore is on the stage

I get drunk in the morning, I don't look for afternoons
I don't care if tomorrow never comes
I've been pushed and kicked around, it seems, my whole life
And now I'm tired, Lord, I'm so damn tired inside

So let's rock it with the band, turn this shit up to ten now
I got a feeling you've been waiting for way too long now
And if you're looking for a party you came to the right spot
So drink them down motherfuckers and roll with the Kid Rock
And the band plays

[Chorus]
And I thank you people for feeling me, I'm feeling you too
Oh what a ride it's been
Up and down, all around the world
We've been, we're back, you're here
Let's make the most of our time now
And if you get up, I won't let you down

[Verse 2]
And when the power hits the brain you'll be feeling it real fine
I'm talking guitars, car sex and real cheap wine
On time and tight, you let me hear it if you want more
I got a fifth of good music, if you're holding out, pour more

[Verse 3]
And I thank you people for feeling me, I'm feeling you too
Oh what a ride it's been
Up and down, all around the world
We've been, we're back, you're here
Let's make the most of our time now
And if you get up, I won't let you down

[Outro]
Get up, get up, yeah
Get up, get up, yeah
What a ride, and I thank you, people, thank you
