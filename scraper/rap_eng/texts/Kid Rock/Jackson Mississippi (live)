Yeaaaaahhhhhh!

When the sunshine showed her face
I felt like I was ready to die
Went looking for a place to hide
A hole I could crawl inside
Long lines, whiskey bottles, and the same old song
I smell death in the air and I know it won't be long

And I could say I'm trying to change
But that's just another lie
It's been a day and a half - and I'm still high

And I feel like Jackson, Mississippi
(a river runnin')
Like Jackson, Mississippi
(a river runnin')
Ja-Ja-Jackson, Mississippi
(a river runnin')
Like Jackson, Mississippi
A river runnin' through my veins

When the daylight disappeared
I took a good look inside - behind my pride
I sat down and cried
I know I'm not a fool
But I don't know what's wrong
Maybe it's time to pack and just move on

And I could say I'm trying to change
But that's just another lie
I'm looking for someone to tell me why

I feel like Jackson, Mississippi
(a river runnin')
Like Jackson, Mississippi
(a river runnin')
Ja-Ja-Jackson, Mississippi
(a river runnin')
Like Jackson, Mississippi
A river runnin' through my veins

A river runnin'
A river runnin' through my veins
A river runnin' athrough my veins
A river that's runnin' through my veins
