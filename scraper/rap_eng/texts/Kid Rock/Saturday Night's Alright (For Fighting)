[Verse 1: Nickelback]
It's getting late, I haven't seen my date
So tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer

[Verse 2: Nickelback]
My old man's drunker than a bar full of wino's
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair

[Chorus: Nickelback & Kid Rock]
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this town alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright

[Verse 3: Nickelback]
Packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a woman to treat me right
I could use a little muscle to get what I need
I'll drink a fifth of Jack and scream out "She's with me!"

[Verse 4: Nickelback]
A couple of sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats from the bottom of a glass

[Chorus: Nickelback & Kid Rock]
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this town alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright

[Guitar Solo: Nickelback & Kid Rock]

[Chorus: Nickelback & Kid Rock]
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this town alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright

[Outro: Nickelback & Kid Rock]
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's all right
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's all right
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's all right
