[Verse 1]
I feel the world is cheating
My heart is barely beating
Like a lone wolf in the pack
No one to believe in
Trying to fight these demons
Where I’m going’s where I’m at

[Chorus]
Like high plains drifters
And midnight misters
Dancing with the devil’s rock and roll
Dirt poor playboys
And drug store cowboys
Hey, rebel soul

[Verse 2]
I’ve been a man of reason
Only to end up even
I’ve paid the price of giving back
Low down and double dealing
Up on the mountain kneeling
I feel your love is just a trap

[Chorus]
Like high plains drifters
And midnight misters
Sifting through the devil’s pot o’ gold
Dirt poor playboys
And drug store cowboys
Hey, rebel soul

[Verse 3]
I feel just like I’m trapped by nighttime
I sleep with one eye open in the day
I’ve walked the wrong way but I’ve walked a long way
Touched by the hand of treason
I’m through with not believing
I’m leaving town my bags are packed
And if you feel the need when
You finally find your feelings
You’ll know just where to find me at

[Chorus]
With high plains drifters
And midnight misters
Dancing with the devil’s rock n roll
Dirt poor playboys
And drug store cowboys
Hey, rebel soul
