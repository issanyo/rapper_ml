Daddy cool, hey, yeah, ah
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Joe C.]
See me cruisin' in my caddy, ho's they like to call me daddy
Cool, when I'm stylin', just rollin' on my island
Now just in case I pack heat, keep a case of brew in my backseat
Got a packet full of cash, hey, got a fatty in my ashtray

I'm cool (daddy cool), call me cool (daddy cool)
I'm cool (daddy cool), call me cool (yeah)
Bad ass, daddy cool, bad ass, daddy cool
Bad ass, daddy cool, bad ass

[Kid Rock] (Joe C.)
Mackin' to this phat beat, bass pushin' through my backseat
You know I got that gangsta lean
Ho's they all adore me, I stop and they all swarm me
To check out all my fly gold rings
They treat me like the mayor, cause I'm the biggest player
(Mackin' all honeys up here in the D baby) You know I do
Grubbin' on some pork rinds, kickin' out them sex rhymes
Everybody wants to be my friend
But I can't be your friend no, unless you got some endo
To smoke (I ain't no joke)

Call me cool (daddy cool), I'm cool (daddy cool)
Call me cool (daddy cool), I'm cool (yeah)
Bad ass, daddy cool, bad ass, daddy cool
Bad ass, daddy cool, bad ass

[Unknown Female Singer]
I like the way you profile, them posey's they got style
Daddy can I roll with you?
Here's some money for your gas tank, a forty and a fatty
Daddy, so I'm down with you

[Kid Rock] (Joe C.)
Now, some people say my mind's blown, I'm coolin' like a snow cone
On my cell phone I'm paid, G, can't call me, just page me
Young ladies, young ladies, I like 'em underage see
Some say that's statutory (But I say it's mandatory)
My story ain't that complex, two forties and a rolex
I rip, I rock, I roll, G, I trim my hair with the flowbee
Got soul, G, like AL Green, co-coolin' like the A-Team
From Maine to San Francisco, I'm shootin' like a pistol
I'm so slick, I'm Crisco, daddy likes to disco

Come on, work it on out

Call me cool (daddy cool), I'm cool (daddy cool)
Call me cool (daddy cool), I'm cool (yeah)
Bad ass, daddy cool, bad ass, daddy cool
Bad ass, daddy cool, bad ass
