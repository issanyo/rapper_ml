[Verse 1]
Used as a scapegoat and taped to the wall
Bruised and abused on some foreign soil
Trained to kill baby, that's what we do
And programmed to bleed red, white and blue

[Chorus]
Come on and grab your guns, let's ride
And may your conscience be your guide
I'll say a prayer for you to make it through to the other side
Tonight's the night, we fight or die

[Verse 2]
Grab your guns son, said we headed for war
Like your uncle JT done years before
No pussy, no dope, this isn't Saigon
But keep your heads up for roadside bombs

[Chorus]
Come on and grab your guns, let's ride
And may your conscience be your guide
I'll say a prayer for you to make it through to the other side
Tonight's the night, we fight or die

[Verse 3]
Even in darkness, you're my strength
My soul, my will to survive
But in this fight I stand ready to die

[Chorus]
Come on and grab your guns, let's ride
And may your conscience be your guide
I'll say a prayer for you to make it through to the other side
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Come on and grab your guns, let's ride
And may your conscience be your guide
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh whoa
Oh oh oh oh whoa
Oh oh oh oh whoa
Oh oh oh oh whoa
Oh oh oh oh whoa
Oh oh oh oh whoa
Oh oh oh oh whoa
