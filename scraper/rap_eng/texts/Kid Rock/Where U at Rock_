(Verse 1)
Unh I grew up hurding cattle
I got more rhymes than heroin in Seattle
You wanna battle with the Rock quit frontin
I'll spit on your ass and then tell you that you ain't nothin
Grab your honey and your beer and I'll break South
Take your money then I'll tell ya get the hell out
I'll put your head out this is my night
How ya gonna step with Rock when I got the mic
I shot the sheriff and the deputy too
Paid off the Feds now its all about my crew
What you hoes wanna do
One at a time or all at once
I'll still roll through your whole crew
Like a south bound trucker
Hoss and mother fuckers take shorts
Mother fuckers take a loss
And when you step with your anger
I'm like the robot from lost in space (danger danger)
I give a warning but if you don't take it
I'll put my arm around your neck
Like we're cool then I'll break it
It's all real cop a feel from my steel
Here's the deal when I say clap your hands like a seal
Or better yet give respect where it's earned
You eat me up I'm like a hot pepper and you might get burned
You took a turn for the worst
Walked up in my face rode away in a hearse
(Now how you gonna front on that)
Kid Rock's in the house that's where I'm at

Chorus:
(Where you at rock, where you at?)
Over here in the rear with your girl and the 40's of beer
(Where you at rock, where you at?)
Over there with the bad attitude cause I just don't care
(Where you at rock where you at?)
(Where you at rock where you at?)
1 2 and you don't stop
3 4 and you don't quit
1 2 and you don't stop

(Verse 2)
]From the depths of hell to God's right hand side
I'm what's left of the get paid, self made pride
I'll step in stride I'm raw as cow hide
My first LP is still sellin that ain't no Jive
Am I the chosen one
Some people ain't gettin where I'm comin from
Or where I'm goin to stand back
Kid Rock's in the house that's where I'm at

Chorus

(Rock the house yo)

(Verse 3)
And I'll be the long haired wizard with the lazy eye
Ask the ladies and they'll tell ya that I'm crazy fly
I'm steppin to the mic like a soldier bro
I hate to sound like a dick but I told ya so, ho
Old Crow and a soul full of desperation
I'm rockin up on the mic with no consideration
For your church or your family
Ayn Rand couldn't stand me so she banned me
I'm like a dandy lion Jack
You can cut me down and then I'll pop right back
And attack from the back like a great white
I'm not down with the scrappin but I'm down for the gunfight
Behind my back talkin shit
But when I front your ass you wanna act like a little bitch
Keep on and you get your ass macked
Kid Rock's in the house that's where I'm at

Chorus

(Over here, over here, unh, the over here)

(Over here, over here, unh, the over here)

Where U at Rock, Where U at?
