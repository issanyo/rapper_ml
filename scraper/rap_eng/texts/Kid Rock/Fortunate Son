Some folks are born, made to wave the flag
Ooh, they're red, white and blue
And when the band plays hail to the chief
Ooh, they point the cannon at You, Lord

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no senators son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no

Yeah, some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves, oh
But when the tax man comes to the door
Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale, yes

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaires son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks inherit star spangled eyes
Ooh, they send You down to war, Lord
And when you ask them, how much should we give?
Ooh, they only answer more, more, more, yoh

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no military son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, one

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no, no, no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate son, no, no, no
