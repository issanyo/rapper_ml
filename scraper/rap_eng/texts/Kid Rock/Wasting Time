I'm a pimp, you can check my stats
And roll in a Fleetwood, that's how I mack
I rock all the tracks, so the world knows
I love all the girls, smack all the hoes
Show love to those who come real with it
Life's a bitch, but I deal with it
I'm in it to win it like Yzerman
Could drink about 15 Heinikeins
I'm not born again, but if I was
I'd ask to come back with a little more love
Well I'm puffing a Winston, drinking a four-oh
Kid Rock, and I'ma let you know

[Chorus x 2]
I've been sitting here just wasting time
Drinking smoking thinking trying to free my mind

It's been a couple of months in this smokey room
Eating shrooms drinking Boone's, writing tunes
And hoping to get one of these mother fucking songs to hit
A little bit of love that's all I need
A little inspiration and a bag of weed
A seed to plant so my tree can grow
You know I left my girl cause I need that hooooo-ld up
Wait a minute I'm about to flow
Like a breeze through the trees you can watch me blow
Puffing a Winston, drinking a four-oh
Kid Rock and I'ma let you know

[Chorus x 2]
I've been sitting here just wasting time
Drinking smoking thinking trying to free my mind

I ain't no rough guy, ain't no tough guy
Don't get out much and don't dress up fly
A pawn in the game that's all I am
Giving all my ducats to Uncle Sam
Fuck it, I'm free to do what I please little lady
I was born at night, but not last night baby
I've been around, seen some things
I slept in dumpsters, got high with kings
I don't bring much, ain't gotta lot to say
But I got more time than Morris Day
Puffing a Winston drinking a four-oh
Kid Rock and I'ma let you know

[Chorus]
I've been sitting here just wasting time
Drinking smoking thinking trying to free my mind
