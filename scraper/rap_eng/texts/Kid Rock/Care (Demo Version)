[Kid Rock]
Day by day my life gets colder
My ice grows thin as I get older
Peace in pieces, bloody and bruised
I feel so helpless and confused

'Cause I hear screamin' on the left, yellin' on the right
I’m sitting in the middle tryin' to live my life

[Chorus: Kid Rock]
'Cause I can't stop the war
Shelter homeless, feed the poor
I can’t walk on water
I can’t save your sons and daughters
While I can’t change the world and make things fair
The least that I can do...
The least that I can do...
The least that I can do is care

[Mary J. Blige]
I pray and pray for life’s salvation
Faith is tried and true in tribulation, yeah
Love is lost and lonely, check the news
And with these open arms I’ll wait for you

'Cause I hear screamin' on the left, yellin' on the right
Sitting in the middle trying to live my life

[Chorus: Kid Rock & Mary J. Blige]
'Cause I can't stop the war
Shelter homeless, feed the poor
I can’t walk on water
I can’t save your sons and daughters
While I can’t change the world to make things fair
The least that I can do...
The least that I can do...
The least that I can do is care

[T.I.]
For the life of me, I can’t see how the devil keep enticing me
All you sees a felon, I know God can see whats right in me
How I can be labeled as a villain in the first place
When the worst case scenario is my birthplace
I'm just tryin' to keep from fallin' victim to the murder rate
Take my life lesson convincing the adolescents
That a God up in heaven, sending down blessings
And your future ain’t brighter than your present, quit stressin'
Screamin' on the left and yellin' on the right
While I'm sittin' in the middle trying to live my life
Let's go

[Chorus: Kid Rock & Mary J. Blige + (T.I.)]
'Cause I can't stop the war
Shelter homeless, feed the poor
I can't walk on water I can't save your sons and daughters
While I can't change the world and make things fair (Wish I could, though)
The least that I can do is care

No, I can't stop the war
Shelter homeless, feed the poor
I can't walk on water
I can't save your sons and daughters
While I can't change the world and make things fair (I wish I could, though)
The least that I can do...
The least that I can do...
The least that I can do...
Oh is CARE
Yes, I can...CARE
You know I can...CARE
Yes, I can...CARE (It's what you can do)
Oh, care
