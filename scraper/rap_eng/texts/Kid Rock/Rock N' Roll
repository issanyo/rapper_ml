[Verse 1]
Break out the whiskey
And a bottle of wine
Take your shirt off bitch
And chop me out a line
Dim the lights down low
Turn up the stereo
Dant say a word
I already know

Youve never done this before
But you felt like trying
Ive done this plenty of times
And i know your lying
You know i know

[Verse 2]
You want a shot
So i will take aim
Dont even ask me
If i know your name
Dont look so shocked
Do not be confused
I just wanna shoot your soul
Full of rhythm and blues

Them boys been selling you lines
But you ain't been buyin
But what im given is free
So its well worth trying

[Verse 3]
Because i know you like to rock-n-roll
You like to rock-n-roll
Ill rock you baby all night long
Then i gots to roll

Theres no one here left
We can blame
Its a lonley walk of shame
I know
We gonna rock-n-roll
Can you feel that
Can you feel that

[Verse 4]
Used to like to disco
Now you wanna rock-n-roll

Bus is leaving baby
Were pulling out
Them austin dallas houston girls
Are callin us out
Girl dry them eyes
Im not good at goodbyes
Tell all your friends
Im that type of guy
That'll bring out the women
That youve been hidin
Its human nature to be
What we have all been denying

[Verse 5]
Baby dont seel tickets
To a player that already playing
Just be who you are
But understand what im sayin

Everybody likes to rock-n-roll
They like to rock-n-roll
Rock-n-roll
They like to rock-n-roll
Love me baby all night long
