[Verse 1]
I’m gonna find a highway or back road I could roll on
Put some weight in the tank now and fire up my favorite song
I’m gonna ride to nowhere or anywhere I can be free, yeah
Cuz I know somewhere there’s a good time lookin’ for me

I’m gonna find the crossroads and wash Mississippi clean
And deal that devil his due me and old Jimmy Beam
I’m gonna find some white lines and follow them wherever they lead
Cuz I know somewhere there’s a good time lookin’ for me

[Hook]
A juke joint jumpin’ with whiskey flowing like a river, yeah
A cowboy band with a banjo picker and a fiddler, yeah
I’m gonna look under every stone and shake every tree
Cuz I know somewhere there’s a good time lookin’ for me

[Verse 2]
I’m gonna keep on moving even if I have to thumb my way
I’m so tired of feuding and watching my life slip away
Now I don’t really care if it’s New York or Tennessee
Cuz I know somewhere there’s a good time lookin’ for me

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I said baby, baby, baby don’t you wanna go?
I said baby, baby, baby don’t you wanna go?

[Outro]
I got my hand on the throttle, I’m telling you I’m on my way
I can’t wait for tomorrow or sit around for Judgment Day
And I could care less about anywhere that I gotta be
Cuz I know somewhere there’s a good time lookin’ for me (x3)
