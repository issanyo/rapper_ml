[Verse 1]



Burning

Oh no, oh no, here we go now[X3]
Oh no[?]


Went to New York to cut my first LP
Riding down Broadway in a taxi
Hang a right at 25th
Just a little too swift, jo
Let me out, I'm gonna walk from here on
Heres four bucks you drive like a moron
Lost in the apple and I'm all alone

[Chorus]
Cause New York's Not My Home

[Verse 2]
In the village just illing with a forty in a brown bag
I'm seeing freaks, and also fags
I see a set of nice legs within in my site
But it's a fucking transvestite
Walking in the daylight
Now I'm tripping and I'm like blown
But I take another sip and say to each his own
He'd get dissed in Detroit, but I'll leave him alone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now if your sounds are knocking to the cool Kid Rocking
Has got your girl jocking
Take a chill pill young man, close your flap
Cause like the Piston Joe, I'm going back to back
With a track, uh, that's just too clean
I got my pistol packed and a fifth of Jim Beam
Only 19, and my name ain't Wilbur
But I pull more hoes then Long Jon Silver
I don't dress up, or try to look pretty
Instead I rock the house in every major city
From the tip of Maine to the coast of Cali
I get down and I yodle in the valley
Can't say I'm from the Bronx or Brook-land zones

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Eight ave in the 40 deuce, it's like a freak show
A lot of hookers try to pop that weak, so
I walk with a limp when I pimp through
Or co-mack those hoes if I'm illing with the Beast Crew
It's picking up, ill check this fact
These Mother Fuckers pay over 2.50 for a big mac
Con-jested, overcrowded, cya I'm gone

[Chorus]
