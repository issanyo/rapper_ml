[Chorus]
Kid Rock an' I got all the hoes saying
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby
Fuck me baby, fuck me baby all night long
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby
Fuck me baby, fuck me until the break of dawn

[Verse 1]
And while your out gang-banging
Tryin to catch a murder case
Your ho's on my couch
Getting fucked in the face
Bumping to the bass of the old school rap jams
This ain't tennis
But yo I'll use my backhand
On any grown man who tries to check Rock
I wanna head-bang, I gotta hip-hop
Cause I'm a stick with what got me paid
Licking that coochie with the high-top fade
Im self-made like Henry Ford
I'm on this mic but it feels like I been here before
I want more then the next man
Respect, plus the cash, big checks
And mack on hoes like Rudy Ray
Cause a reach around just sounds so gay
I don't even swing that way
I told you hoes before I'm the K
I to the D, R-O-C-K'in
Rhyme saying guitar playing
Turntables spinning at a basement jam
No fame, no money, but you wouldn't understand
What its like to be so real
You got the beats, and the rhymes
But you ain't got no feel
I don't need the fancy music to make mine
Just a beat and a funky-ass bass line
Drop a couple cuts on this track
8 tracks to the motherfucking wax
So why you're making records that don't recoup
I'm in the house getting paid like Snoop

[Chorus]
Kid Rock and I got all the hoes saying
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby
Fuck me baby, fuck me baby all night long
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby
Fuck me baby, fuck me til the break of dawn[?] [?]yeah all night long

[Verse 2]
I want my khakis washed, starched, and creased
I want a order of fries with a side of grease
I wish for peace throughout this land
I want the whole fuckin world in my hand
I want a band like the U.S. funk mob
See I can rap I don't have to lay sod
Just ta make ends meet
October 31st, yelling "Trick-or-treat"
"Oh aren't you a little old to be tricking"
You see my mask and bag, bitch, I ain't bull shitting
Hittin homeruns like Rusty Staub
I'm kinda anal, cause I ain't no fuckin slob
I'm the cradle thats able ta rock any format
But still I'm labled, and treated like a doormat
Where's the whores at
West side, hoes like cars so I ride em for a test drive
I'm like a pringle, I won't go soft
I got a new jingle I'm about to go off
Hey ho check it out, I really like to turn you out
And if you'de be good to me, I'll yodel in your valley
Kid Rock is nothing nice
Got the soft porn booming with the beans and rice
Got a head full of lice cause I'm a such a scum
Got a pocket-full of money, but I'm dressed like a bum
Got a business mind so if I lose the funk
I'll still be in the house getting paid like Trump

[Chorus]
Kid Rock and I got all the hoes saying
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby
Fuck me baby, fuck me baby all night long
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby
Fuck me baby, fuck me til the break of dawn
Oh yeah, come on come on baby, all night long
Fuck me baby, fuck me baby
Come on, come on, come on
