[Verse 1]
Guess who's back
I used to be broke, Confused, No Joke
Got used, Smoked Dope
Paid Dues, Refused, To give up quick
Now there's 10 Million Motherfuckers on my dick
Sold what
Say how, Say who
Fuck what, Fuck me?
Fuck you!
Come clean You know I will, drink a fifth of Jim Beam
And still stand still
I'm the illest fool
Cooler than the water in a swimming pool
Fly like a seagull kicking like a mule
More jams than a Beatle from Liverpool
I deliver fool, Now who the fuck are you?
I'm Kid motherfucking Rock from the old school
Got more money than Matchbox 20
Get more ass than Mark McGrath

[Chorus]
They say I'm cocky and I say what
It isn't bragging motherfucker if you back it up
They say I'm cocky and I say what
It isn't bragging motherfucker if you back it up

[Verse 2]
I'm from the outskirts of Detroit Rock City
A-Shirts,Cadillacs,Big titties
Skinny models you can keep those
I like big corn fed Midwestern ho's
Don't you know
Talk fast
Pimp slow
Show up to black ties in t-shirts & slippers
Sipping liquor, fuck models love strippers
Known as the big tipper with the big dipper
I got queens holding keys to my zipper
Fuck a real good girl
I've got the baddest bitch in the world

[Chorus]
They say I'm cocky and I say what
It isn't bragging motherfucker if you back it up
They say I'm cocky and I say what
It isn't bragging motherfucker if you back it up

[Verse 3]
You think you got it good in Hollywood
I got acres of land laid back in the woods
Holding shares cool like Fonzie
Rolling Lake St. Clair in my forty foot Donzie
You got a Bentley Wow
I got jets with wet bars
And trucks with gold plows
Bitch bow when I pimp thru
For the Kid, the Rock the Red, White and Blue
Who knew the Kid would be
Everything from old George Jones to Jay-Z
Baby I'm sick of getting ripped off
So pissed about to be pissed off
Macking me because you know I'm payed
That's why I'm slapping my gardners,and fucking my maids
Never mind my age but if we're taking numbers
Fifteen million sold motherfucker

[Chorus]
They say I'm cocky and I say what
It isn't bragging motherfucker if you back it up
They say I'm cocky and I say what
It isn't bragging motherfucker if you back it up
Cocky and I say what
It isn't bragging motherfucker if you back it up
They say I'm cocky and I say what
It isn't bragging motherfucker if you back it up
Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up
