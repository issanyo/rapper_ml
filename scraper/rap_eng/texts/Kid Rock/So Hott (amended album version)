You got a body like the devil
And you smell like sex
I can tell you're trouble
But I'm still obsessed

Because you know you're
So hott, I wanna get you alone
So hott, I wanna get you stoned
So hott, I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna fuck you like I'm never gonna see you again

You're like the kiss of death
Like the hand of fate
I can tell you're trouble
But I still wanna taste

Because you know you're
So hott, I wanna get you alone
So hott, I wanna get you stoned
So hott, I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna fuck you like I'm never gonna see you again

Because you know you're
So hott, I wanna get you alone
So hott, I wanna get you stoned
So hott, I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna fuck you like I'm never gonna see you again

You're so hott, I wanna get you alone
I wanna get you stoned
I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna fuck you like I'm never gonna see you again
See you again
See you again
