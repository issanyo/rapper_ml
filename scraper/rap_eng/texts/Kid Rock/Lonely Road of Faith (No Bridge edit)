Up and down that lonely road of faith
I have been there
I'm prepared for the storms and the tides that rise
I've realized one thing, how much I love you
And it hurts to see, to see you cryin'
I believe we can make it through the winds of change
Change

God is great indeed
If you believe, in the afterlife
Yeah we gotta
Make some sense of the pieces that we found
Oh no, Oh no
And if you just hold on
I won't let you fall
I won't let you fall
We can make it through the storms and the winds of change

Oh no, Oh no
Yeah yeah
No No

Though I walk through the valley of darkness
I am not afraid
Cause I know I've got it all

And if the wind blows east, would you follow me
And if the wind blows north, would you stay your course
And if the wind blows west, would you 2nd guess
And if it blows to the south, would you count me out
And if the sun don't shine, would you still be mine
And if the sky turns grey, would you walk away
Would you say I do, if I say I'll be
And walk this road through life with me
You know I love you

On this lonely road of faith
On this looooo-oonely road of faith
