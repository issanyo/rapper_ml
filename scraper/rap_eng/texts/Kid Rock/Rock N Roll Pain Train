[Verse 1]
15 years on this lonely road
I paid my own way
I carried my own load
I never asked too much from no one
I was much too proud
All i ever wanted
Was to play music for
A sold out crowd

Bitches, money fame
They say i had it all
6 foot 1
I walked around like i was
10 feet tall
Did you see me shine
Where the hell where you now
Detroit city back in 99
Stoned out of my mind

[Verse 2]
On that rock-n-roll pain train
I had to slow things down
I live out in the woods now
It helps me keep my feet on
The ground
Life's been good to me so far
Hope its been kind to you
Stand strong in the storms of life
The sun will always shine on you

Now I've been rolling on love n lust
I ride around on this million dollar bus
But this is just a bus man
I can't sleep at night
Man i miss my babies
And id really like to fuck my wife
But she IS NOT there tonight

[Verse 3]
On the rock-n-roll pain train
After the lights go down
I live out in the woods now
It helps me keep my feet on the ground

Life's been good to me so far
Hope its been kind to you
Stand strong in the storms of life
The sun will always shine on you

I've seen this train wreck
Time and time again
I felt its pain
I've seen it take my friends
You've got to stop and take a look man
Or life will pass you by
Get your guitar and a good song
That's all you really need to ride

[Outro]
On that rock-n-roll pain train
I can't slow it down
The music and the whiskey
Don't it make you wanna get loud
Lifes been good to me so far
I hope its been kind to you
Stand strong in the storms of life
The sun will always shine on you
The sun will always shine on you
