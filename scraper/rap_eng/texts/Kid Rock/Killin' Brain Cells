[Verse]
Kid rock that's right you know I'm back ho
From the dead where I had to lay low
Seems strange but I ain't changed nothin, G
Pot smoking beer drinking mother fucker that's me
In the flesh and I guess I'm the best
In the mother fucking mid-west because there's no contest
For the pimp in the pimp of the nation
So fuck college and a good education
All we need to learn is how to hold hands
Then we could live in peace in my homeland
God damn the way my pain swells
I spend all my time killing brain cells
The light shed on me was a dim gleam
So I live life in a bottle of Jim Beam
Dropping dots or sniffing that blow black
I go to sleep at night watching Kojak
Fuck hoes because I'm no big fag
Roll with Zig Zags like to read skin mags
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the bass I'd probably pluck it like this
People want to know what I'm thinking but I don't care
So I keep my thoughts in a bottle of Cuervo
Just a wild young buck
Got banned from The Shelter but I really don't give a fuck
Because I still be clowning suckers be frowning
Forties of Busch I be pounding
I am not dead in the head like Manson
I'm more laid back than mother fucking Ted Danson
Hanson brothers style when I'm rumbling
Couple of shots of Don Q and I be stumbling
Fumbling footballs hanging in the pool halls
Out late night with my crew stealing U-hauls
I'm not into having clean fun
I step into the party strapped with a machine gun
But I'm no gangster like Gotti
"I'm just an M.C. to put the boogie in the party"
Back in black plus a new jack
And I won't quit till your ears blow from feedback
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the guitar I'd probably strum it like this

So give it up bitch because I'm the Kid Rock
And today I know you don't want to get shot
You look gay you're too cliche
So fuck all you all hoes and yo Chuck pass the jay
Selling me out like bitches to make a quick buck
But mother fuckers like you all just have no luck
Your little plan was a flop
Trying to get em on by selling out the Kid Rock
A part of me was with you but yo he died
And I'm glad you stepped off because I am not giving no free rides
You little bald headed peon
And fuck it mother fucker if you want it lets get the beef on
Because I'm sure I'm sure you
Are gonna try to come back around but I'll ignore ya
It only takes one shot to floor ya
Because I'm Kid Rock bitch and I'm real motha for ya
Better jet so because I won't let no hoes from the Metro
Take mine "what up doe"
Come look son I'm number one
"because I worked like a bitch to get the job done"
In the Twilight Zone with Rod Serling
I am not going bald so fuck Sy Sperling
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the harmonica I'd probably blow it like this
