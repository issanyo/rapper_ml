It ain't wrong to feel so strong when you think you got it going on
Life has a way of making you pay to the club where we all belong
Now you're free to believe that the good life is guaranteed
But watch your step 'cos it's a safe bet, you're gonna end up on your knees

You're gonna get spanked, I'm warning you sister
You're gonna get spanked, life's gonna hit you
You'll never know until you get spanked, you're gonna be humbled
You're gonna get spanked and you're world's gonna crumble
You'll never know until you get spanked

Some do want to prove that there are really just a chosen few
So test your fate, speculate that it can never really happen to you
I've been high, at least tried, I learned to sleep with an open eye
You crossed that line, better take the time to kiss your ass goodbye

You're gonna get spanked, I'm warning you sister
You're gonna get spanked, life's gonna hit you
You'll never know until you get spanked, you're gonna be humbled
You're gonna get spanked and you're world's gonna crumble
You'll never know until you get

When you're so sure you got it right
All alone in the spotlight
You'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming
[Incomprehensible]

You're gonna get spanked, I'm warning you sister
You're gonna get spanked, life's gonna hit you
You'll never know until you get spanked, you're gonna be humbled
You're gonna get spanked and you're world's gonna crumble
You'll never know until you get spanked

I'm warning you sister
You're gonna get spanked, life's gonna hit you
You'll never know until you get spanked
