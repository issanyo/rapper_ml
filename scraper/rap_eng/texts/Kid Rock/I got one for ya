[Verse 1]
Lit up like the Fourth, I'm a happy drunk
Come to poppa big momma because your daddy's drunk
I want to pump pump it up like the Goodyear Blimp
Make ya hollar for a dollar that's the way I pimp
Gold links and minks and shrimp dinners on the bayou
Thems are things that I am not going to buy you
It's like one of them freak things
Hit it once maybe every couple week things
I got no love, I got no riches
I don't roll Vogues and I ain't got Switches
I got no game, I can't reward you
But if you want a long one baby

[Chorus]
I got one for you this is your shot
I got one for you this is your shot

[Verse 2]
Uh-Huh Check It
People always talking what they going to do
They must want their face to maybe taste my shoe
I can't understand all the push and shove
And what the fuck's happened to the peace and love
Who planted that glove man, I don't care
I'm too busy running fingers through your momma's hair
I got no time for the fakes and phonies
The crooks and the creeps and the cops and the cronies
Am I the only one on my side
Test my pride I bet you run and hide
You think I'm weak so you're looking for the kill
But there's sixteen shots in my nine-milimil
I got one for you, uh huh this is your shot
I got one for ya this is your shot
Jimmy Jimmy...Ji-ah Jimmy Jimmy
I Like that
Yeah...lay it down brother
Lay it down with me baby
Hu Hoooooo Hooo
Lay it down with me baby
Ha Ha
This is your chance
Record companies stressing cause they all want hits
Yeah I'm bout it bout it so I make em like this
They say, Hey there boy all we need is one song
Shorten up that hook we don't need it that long
Don't want to hear me cuss, don't want to hear me brag
So I'm grabbing on my thingy while I let my pants sag
Never thinking what I'm writing just writing what I'm doing
They say they like my record but they're still boo-hooing
My joint's always tight, my rhymes will floor you
Hey slime you want to hit money...hahaha

[Chorus][x2]
I got one for you
Bet that ass
This is your shot
Uh huh, Uh huh
I got one for you
Here it is
This is your shot
Uh
We got one for you babe, me and Kid Rock[x2]
Hey hey

[Outro]
I got one for you babe[x3]
Me and Kid Rock we going to rock and going to roll
We going to rock, going to roll, going to rock & roll
Going to rock, gonna roll, we going to rock around
Ha Hiiiiiiiii Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
I like that
