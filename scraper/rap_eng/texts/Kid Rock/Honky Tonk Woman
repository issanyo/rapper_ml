I met her at a barroom queen down in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind
It's just that ho-ho-honky tonk women
Hey gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
It's just that ho-ho-honky tonk women
Hey gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
I laid a divorcee in Detroit City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
And that lady then she covered me with roses
She blew my nose, then she blew my mind
Son, it's just that ho-ho-honky tonk women
I said gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
It's a ho-ho-honky tonk women
Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
It's that ho-ho-honky tonk women
Oh, Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
It's a ho-ho-honky tonk women
I said gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
One more time
Why don't you just gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues?
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
And I just blew my mind
