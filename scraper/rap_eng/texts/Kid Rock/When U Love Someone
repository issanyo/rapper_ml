[Verse 1]
Oooh..Ooooh
I tell you it will shake the earth beneath your feet
The light that shines will redefine your old beliefs
What you reap is what you sow and so it goes
Where you plant your needs is where your garden grows
Before you think about yourself
Think of someone else, it will make you feel
Each day aren't wine and roses
I doubt it's meant to be
Always a cross to bear salvation don't come free
A heart that beats is a heart that bleeds
And you know that's true
So don't deny yourself of something good for you
Before you do it for yourself, do it for someone else
That makes it real

[Chorus]
Because when you love someone
It don't matter what you say
When you love someone
You will dance the night away
When you love someone
There aren't nothing you can't do
Isn't that right
Yeah I want to love someone tonight

[Verse 2]
Will you believe in love or just sit around and judge?
Can you forgive someone or will u hold a grudge?
Because above selfishness there lies a bright blue sky
And wealth and happiness can be a long and lonesome ride
Yes it's hard to steer yourself
Without that someone else to take the wheel
Take the wheel

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Do you believe in the art of growing old
Do you believe that rock and roll can save your soul
Do you believe in everything you do
Because when you do that's when it all comes back to you
Before you think about yourself
Think of someone else
Do it for yourself
And do it for someone else

[Outro]
When you love someone
