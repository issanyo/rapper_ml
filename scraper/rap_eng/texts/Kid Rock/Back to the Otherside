[Intro]
Yeah, listen up son

[Verse 1]
It ain't easy growing up
In the age of this life where it seems that love ain't enough
And not knowing gets tough
All the rage and stride for your dreams could seem handcuffed
You feel bluffed by the masses
All these wanna be kings, wingdings, and jackasses
But time passes fast so keep your head up
Don't let go and know we all fuck up
Yeah, we all fuck

[Chorus]
So take my hand and I'll lead you back to the otherside
(To the otherside)
Get yourself into a better place and live your life
(Yeah, yeah)
Hold your head up high and don't rely on anyone else
(Don't rely on anyone else)
Take it easier on yourself, don't ask why

[Verse 2]
It's a gift this life, but still pragmatic
With no static, it seems some are so dramatic
You could stretch your wits but still can't grab it
Misfits like us they say can't have it
But it's a lie so don't buy the bullshit
Don't get high and sigh I can't deal with
This pain will make you a better man
And if you hold on son, one day you'll understand
One day you'll understand
Come on

[Chorus]
So take my hand and I'll lead you back to the otherside
(To the otherside)
Get yourself into a better place and live your life
(Got to, got to live your life, come on)
Hold your head up high and don't rely on anyone else
Take it easier on yourself, don't ask why
(Don't even ask why)

[Spoken Interlude]

[Verse 3]
It's a easy way out son, so don't do it
Just take my hand, be a man and let's get through it
I know you feel like it ain't worth trying
But whatever it is trust this, it ain't worth dying
And you will find with time no matter what it is
The sun shines [?] and stay positive
And keep giving all you've got to give
Cause God is great and he always forgives
God is great and he always forgives

[Chorus]
So take my hand and I'll lead you back to the otherside
(To the otherside)
Get yourself into a better place and live your life
(Get yourself into a better place)
Hold your head up high and don't rely on anyone else
(Anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone else)
Take it easier on yourself, don't ask why
So take my hand and I'll lead you back to the otherside
Get yourself into a better place and live your life
Hold your head up high and don't rely on anyone else
Take it easier on yourself, don't ask why
