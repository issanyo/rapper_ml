I got the, oh
I got them love sick blues y'all
Man, I can't find my baby
I think she took off with another man
I been around the world lookin', twice, huh

You know I checked in New York City, on the streets and on the subways
And I looked around that tired town to find the one who loved me
I looked out in the Hampton's, thought she'd be hanging with them rich folks
But no she wasn't anywhere hanging on the East Coast

I wish my baby come home
I want my baby come home
I wish my baby come home
I want my baby, yeah, my baby, to come back home
You know I love that girl

I checked down through the southern plains, from Alabama to Georgia
Honey if you hear this, please know I'm lookin' for ya
I checked with all my rebel friends, I've looked around for weeks
And I swear until I find her, I won't eat and I won't sleep

I want my baby come home
I want my baby come home
I want my baby come home
I wish my baby, yeah, my baby, would come back home

I went from Albuquerque to Maine, didn't find a damn thing

So I looked in California, up and down the coast
I looked all over Hollywood and wasn't even close
Never found nothin' so I came home, home to Detroit City
And there she was sittin' on my porch, and baby looked so pretty

Now my baby's back home
Yeah, my baby came home
Yeah, my baby's back home
I'm so happy that my baby is finally home
