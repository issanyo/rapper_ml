Due to a massive amount of bootlegging
And constant downloading
People are no longer buying CDs so that we can get paid for our fucking work
They are just continuing to get songs for free
See, what they do is buy computers, strictly pick songs that they like
And burn them on CDs or put them on iPods
Causing major decrease in sound scan, putting music retail in a tremendous slump
Causing artists such as myself to make no money for record sales
Being forced to tour, causing more stress, more arguments with my wife
Not being able to see my kids, drink more, take more pills
Punch more people in the face, hate the world, and end up in rehab!
(sigh) This has been a Public Service Announcement and an excuse to vent by Marshall Mathers
Not that I wouldn't have done the same thing if I could get music for free when I was a kid
But now that I rap for a living, buy my goddamn CDs!
But in the meantime, buy this Obie Trice bootleg from DJ Whoo Kid
And put more money in his pocket
Thanks!
