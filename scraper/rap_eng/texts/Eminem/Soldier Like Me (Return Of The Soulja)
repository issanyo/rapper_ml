[Intro: 2Pac]
So what I'm gonna do, hopefully, is
I wanna be… I'm, I, I'm not a "wanna be"
I am 2Pac Shakur

2Pac 2005!

{Vocal scratch: "Guess who's back!"}
{Vocal scratch: "Guess who's back!"}
{Vocal scratch: "Guess who's back!"}
{Vocal scratch: "Guess who's back!"}

[Refrain: 2Pac]
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Posse deep as I roll through the streets
Motherfuck the police as we creep in our Jeeps
Layin' so low you'd think I'm asleep
But at the slightest beef I'm robbin' niggas of they teeth
And OPD can get the dick if they play toughy
Last time them niggas rushed me
I ain't bust, but now I'm touchy, trust me
Ain't nothin' jumpin' but these buckshots
A nigga's got enough knocks, I'm poppin' at corrupt cops
Them motherfuckers catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem
Now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold a
Motherfuckin' soldier, ready to roll and take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin'
Roll to the door, throw a grenade in the precinct
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin' ‘cause there's no stoppin' till they rubbed out
And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunition's and them bitches will be dead soon
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge, now count the bodies
Twenty cops, one for every year in jail
Tryna keep a nigga down, but shit fails
Before I let you take me, I told ya
Fuck bein' trapped — I'm a soulja!

[Chorus: Eminem]
I bet you that I got something you ain't got
That's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle
It ain't Scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G
‘Cause that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do
‘Cause that ain't you, you just frontin', you ain't?

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
2Pac and the Mad Bitch
In the six-fo' rag on them thangs, that's a bad bitch
Gettin' ghost on them bitches in the town
Bustin' out the back seat, nigga, when we clown
Homie, is you down? Dee got the strap and she anxious
Hurry up 'fore she spank shit
Comin' round the corner spittin' rounds
They can't hold me down
Caught them sucker-ass bitches outta bounds
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate
Make 'em pray for the judgement day
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate
Make 'em pray for the judgment day—stinkin' beyotch!

[Chorus: Eminem]
I bet you that I got somethin' you ain't got
That's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle
It ain't Scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G
‘Cause that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do
‘Cause that ain't you, you just frontin', you ain't

[Refrain: 2Pac]
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
