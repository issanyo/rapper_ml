[Intro]
Your mother.. you fuckin' faggot
Ayo, this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody
Rest in peace, we ain't forget about you, you fuckin' homo, we still remember

[Verse 1]
There once was a man who liked to jump around
But he got too old to jump up and down
So he put the mic down and picked the guitar up
Started singin the blues like there was no tomorrow
Left his boys in the House of Pain
It was the wisest decision he ever made
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
Was try to buck a .380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do

[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

[Verse 2]
I remember back when you had the Knack
And I remember when you had your first heart attack
I was right there laughin when I heard the news
I just wish the cardiac woulda murdered you
Maybe Ice-T's right, you are a bitch
You come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich
But the dumbest thing you could ever do
Was try to buck a 380 on those who act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do

[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

[Verse 3]
Remember back in '94, like right before Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When House of Pain was outta fame like someone doused the flame
And they became destined to never jump around again
Or even further back, when I first had heard "The Knack"
And you were down with Syndicate, I went to get your shit, man I was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the shit
Now you sound ridiculous, you dickless piece of shit
How could you diss me, bitch?
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude
Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you
Started rhymin, then you left the room and didn't say goodbye or nothin'?
Like you mad that someone else was white and tried to rhyme or somethin
I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin to steal your light or nothin
But you're a homosexual, white rappin Irish (Muslim)
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a *Muslim* too
Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do
What's up with you? I never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me?
Knowin' I could rap circles around you, what, are you as nuts as me?
Plus I can sing better than you and I don't fuckin' sing
And probably play guitar better, and I ain't never touched a string
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you
I'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92
So everytime I write a lyric, I'mma think of you
And maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues

[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

[Outro]
You fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin faggot, sissy fuck
And by the way, a .380's a fuckin' sissy gun
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin' real gun, you little bitch
Next time say my fuckin' name in a song, don't be subliminal about it
You wanna fuckin' diss me, diss me you fuckin' faggot
You fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin' little bitch, fuckin' cunt
