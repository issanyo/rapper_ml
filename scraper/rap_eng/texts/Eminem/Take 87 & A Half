[Intro]
Mc Double M and DJ Buttafingaz, take 87 and a half

(Ready?)

[Verse 1]
Man where's my papers?

New Jacks, meaning new don't mean jack
Not concerned about a sucka, and senseless crap
No time to waste time, in this profession
Too busy advancing, moving forward, progressin'
Agility, ability, got to stay nimble
My rhymes are not basic, as basic's too simple
Making corrections to fit perfection
Breaking rhymes and lines into different sections
New style intact, in fact rhymes are jam packed
Back to back, lines are being stacked
Every soul that I go, suckas look at me mean
I'm kicking ass faster a split in the scene
Provin' I'm not joking, fingers keep smokin'
Talk shit to me and your jaw gets broken
Step away from me man, don't try to play the role
Of a hero, cause that shit's gettin' old
Wanna battle me, that'll be an ignorant choice
Cause I'll pick up the mic, and take you out with my voice
If you act like a punk, then you're bound to get hurt
Cause I'mma grab you by your shirt and knock your dick in the dirt

[Verse 2]
Jumpin' on the bandwagon, you missed your ride
But don't you know you just committed suicide?
I'll mess you up like a champ, but we not in the ring
We on the stage so it's a whole different thing
If you're bigger than me and you're twice my size
Then it's time for my nine to be recognized
Consider yourself dead if my face turns red
Cause I'mma fill your ass with twenty pounds of lead
I'm not lookin' for trouble but if it comes my way
That'll be the funnest part of my day
You ain't never gonna make it cause you're just too sore
You're fadin' like jeans after every wash
You're seekin' a beef that could move your feet
And at the same time rhymes of the street
Well shit, this is it, though it may be slow
Know it's got a lotta crack, it's a sellout show
Standing room only, no place to sit
But you won't want to once the punchlines kick
They call me a klepto cause I sold the show
You said I'm up to no good, but you're in the front row
Difference between us is I'm first and you're last
So take your wack rhymes and stick 'em up your ass
Y'all wanna bite, I'll give you something to chew
Stick my dick down your throat, and I'mma say "Fuck you!"
You wanna battle me? Man, you best forget it
Keep running your mouth, I'mma put my fist in it
I'll make you eat those words you just spoke
Shove 'em down your throat 'till you fuckin' choke
And when you're gagging, and gasping for breath
I'mma hit you with a right and follow up with a left
Here's another example, I'll let you have a sample
Of the way I fight, my style's ample
Riding down the block on my way to school
Saw a sucker motherfucker thinking he was cool
Sucker flipped me off, I said "Stop the car!"
Max said "Show 'em how bad you are"
Jumped outta the ride, like a bat outta hell
The boy was terrified, I could just tell
He kinda figured that death was near
So he started swinging because of fear
Sucka kept swinging while I just ducked
Came up with a right and the boy was fucked
He fell straight to the ground, he was probably dead
But I ain't stick around to see how bad the boy bled
