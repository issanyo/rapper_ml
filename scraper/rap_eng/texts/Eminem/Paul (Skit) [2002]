Em, it's Paul
Listen, Joel just called me and
He said you're in the fucking back behind his studio
Shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range
I told you not to fucking bring your gun around
Like an idiot, outside of your home
You're gonna get yourself in trouble
Don't bring your gun outside of your home you can't carry it on you
Leave your fuckin' gun at home
