[Round 1: Eminem]
Aight, look! Any rapper saying those kind of rhymes
In this day and age, in this period of time
Tryin' to battle Eminem is worse than David Starr
Tryin' to battle Proof, Eye-Kyu, B-Fat and Bizarre
[…] That's why you beg to differ me
You ain't got no style, plus you lack delivery
Not to brag, I don't mean to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost
[…]
You're that bitch, you couldn't slip into the zone
If I put banana peels around this fuckin' microphone
Go get a bull dozer, start from bottom to top
And tear this building down
‘Cause that's the only way you're wrecking shop
