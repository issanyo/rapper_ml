[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
Wake up this morning I'm shaking I can't be still girl
Too many images running through my mind
Soon as I hit it, I can't get it out my system
Even my brother he asked me what you on

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy (Tay-K47)]
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain, don't keep me waitin' all night
Girl come through, them bath water runnin'
Fire be burning in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room
(Free Santana Bitch!)

[Verse 2: Tay-K47]
Mama told me; "Never lose, cause baby you a winner"
I was lurking 'round his block, he was lurking on my twitter
At the trap with the Glocks nigga, Tay-K babysitter
I was just trying to shine like some muh'fuckin' glitter
I was under rugs with my cuz tryna rob a plug
Little bitch hit me up she want love
I ain't show enough
I said "Bitch I'm a rugrat, I don't know how to love back"
Groupies and them dub sacks, girl that's where my love at

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain, don't keep me waitin' all night
Girl come through, them bath water runnin'
Fire be burning in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo' style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain, don't keep me waitin' all night
Girl come through, them bath water runnin'
Fire be burning in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room
Girl come through, them bath water runnin'
Fire be burning in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room

[Outro: Marc E. Bassy]
We ain't playin anymore
Privacy on the door
(Privacy on the door)
We ain't playin anymore
Privacy on the door
When we finish baby
Ain't gon' need no more
