Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me?
And everything I’m holding close, is so far away from me?
They don’t want me to lie but, they don't wanna' hear the truth
It never made sense to me
Why everything I love the most, is so wrong for me!

[Verse 1]
Yeah! Problematic, I’m so problematic
That I’m probably a problem addict
Pop an aspirin cause my head is hurtin'
Hotel bedroom, missin' curtains
Sheets everywhere like a storm has passed
In fact it looks like I got into a wrestlin' match
Empty bottle of Jack, I could tell I did that
I could smell it in fact, it's like death and ass
Think for a minute if I look over and look
To my left is an opened book, a Bible
To my right is a guilty conscience and her name is Brooke, my rival
At least I think her name was Brook
She’s asleep, and I’m givin' her the lamest look
Move her hair back so that I could see your face
Cause it was dark and I met her at the game it took
About 5 minutes to get her inside the whip
Another 5 minutes to get up inside the lips
Never try really man, I really tried to slip, out
But it was just thighs and hips
OK, I was high, shit
On alchohol and the Yelawolf ego trip
Leave her lying in bed cause I don’t need no kiss
And it’s the walk of shame again!

[Verse 2]
Smokin’ hot, throw it up
Keep a fifth off in my cup
Trying not to be a simp
But every time I take a sip
I think I’m gonna fall in lust
I'm back and forth like I'm packing a truck
In a house that never runs out of boxes
Knowing that if I put on my tennis shoes
And a fresh fit, I’ll end up sockless
By the end of the night, flip flopping
I’ll B-Boy if you let me Hip Hop in
Alligator skin cowgirl boots only means let’s get it crockin’
That mini skirt makes any man a flirt
Manicures, animal furs and a purse
What could a little bit of smoke and Henny hurt?
You make any jerk make a penny work
Sinister with sin in her
She can leave a devil sitting in the church
On another level, not in the earth
Jessica Alba had twins at birth
Trippin' sure, piles of E, ménage-a-trois, piles of three
Waking up again, not proud of me
Yeah, I'm a lousy fiend
