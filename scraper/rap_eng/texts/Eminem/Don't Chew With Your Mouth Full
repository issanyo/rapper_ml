[Verse 1]
Livin' like a sleuth
... ingenuity
... voraciously ... acuity
...

[Hook]
But don't chew with your mouth full
Don't chew with your mouth full
Cause if you chew with your mouth full
You'll end up biting your toes

[Verse 2]
...
Tossin' curves that are nerve-wrackin'
[Irv?] slackin' I'm throwin' pitches uh switches
Which is trickery, victory's repetitious
Though weaker ones and overeager ones that just get ate up
Though many will often try to duplicate the style I made up
If my weight up it wouldn't matter, you're slow as a paraplegic
Whoops you missed, here's my fist, eat it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
...
Frostbite

[Verse 4]
You take out crews by yourself take out this one
I'm a soloist chaos is a soloist pick one
He's about to put more tracks in your soul
And put your crew in a pile and jack em up like a totem pole
I give you a dance and make you change direction or
Have a spot reserved in a handicapped parking section
How the hell can you leave when your trainless?
Your smooth sailing hit a storm and looks likes your failing
Left a band stranded empty handed
Put so much as a toe in my way and get branded
I'm standing colossal drag you out like a fossil
With a rap so hot it will cause a snot in your nostril
Take you out take you out with simplicity
I'm shocking so bad I'll make you shit electricity
Try flip me or whip me you fucking fed bon appetite eat the concrete dick head

[Hook]

[Outro]

When will he ever learn?
I guess never
