[Hook: Tim Kelley (V-Top)]
Girl I got to have you and it's driving me insane
I just want to make love until our bodies engulf in flames
Can't you see that I just want the chance to be your fantasy
And if you give me just one night that's all I need to make you mine

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've got divas sleeping at my house like a lodge
Cause after one massage, I hit them with a barrage of flesh they can't dodge
My garage and driveway are filled with parked cars to the street from visitors who didn't survive me
One night stand of loosey-coochie, dying in my animal house with my neighbors like John Belushi
I talk dirty to nuns until they're horny as Satan, and keep them running back there like Walter Payton
Here ya go, here's my number yo, dial M&M for Murder if you wanna undergo
A hard day's night and we can get on it
I pack a full load, and I do ya like laundry
Cause I believe that all bad girls must get spanked
So come gank the clank, and we'll go clankety-clank
And you'll be permanently added to my collection
So I suggest you feed the dogs in front of the lawn before ya check in

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chaos Kid]
See, I may be a youngster but baby I can do the pullup for ya
Physically delirious so get your butt over
Cause like Whitney I've been saving all my love for you
So roll out the the great taste of Pepsi, and get ready for Mountain Dew!
Here's a [?] cause looks can be deceiving
If you look into my eyes you'll be perceiving a sexual demon
And don't measure me in just 12 inches, since it's essential to make you suffer a bit, [?]
So let's put our heads together, we'll come up with something
Jimmy Deans are like raw cut, you're cookin', so
Grab the meat, at a place that's dirt cheap [?] for such a delicacy
You'll be royalty to me if there's loyalty to me baby
Yeah maybe I get this sweaty and salty [?]
We'll get in that heavy-duty bucket
I ain't using protection, I ain't Vanilla Ice, I want the satisfaction!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
All I'm asking for is one night
And in the heat of the moment, your pants dropped and I do my best work at night
So after seven I can't stop, once I kiss you you'll be wanting me really bad
And how you feel [?] without the natural aphrodisiac
I'll getcha hot [?] rap
[?] getcha hot [?] graduate [?]
[?]
[?] flooded with anxiety
[?] like "yeah, put it inside of me!"
And once I begin to dig and make that hole twice as big you can't renege
I've got nymphos to where they can't stand sex
Cause I've ended up stretching their muscles like Spandex
Watch 'em squirm like a worm the entire term
Get a firm grip, aim for the eye and shoot sperm!
And all the action got the capability for excitement
But the night ain't done yet, 'till we reach enlightenment
So, yo... do you think you can handle it?

[Hook]
