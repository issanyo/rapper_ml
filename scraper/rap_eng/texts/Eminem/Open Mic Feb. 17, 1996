[Kuniva]
Check my vocals, 'cause you know what I'm about
It's best to play like O.J. Simpson and I just stab out
Why did you enter? You didn't comprehend
See this is a battle for MCs who think they might win
But fuck the battle, let's take it to the streets
'Cause you a pussy, oh well, if you are what you eat
Now you can go get your crew ? you now
? me wrong ? and all this shit gon be blew out
Claiming you jumped out bitch
Nigga we bust in the bitch, you talk more shit than Reggie Miller
Never spent nothing more, nothing less
The first single that you drop is "I wanna be fresh"

[Eminem]
Any rapper sayin' those kind of rhymes
In this day and age, in this period of time
Trying to battle Eminem is worse than David Starr
Trying to battle Proof, Eye-Kyu, B-Flat and Bizarre
? that's why you beg to differ me
You ain't got no style plus you lack delivery
Not to brag, I don't mean to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost
You're that bitch, you couldn't slip up in the zone
If I put banana peels around this fucking microphone
So get a bull dozer, start from bottom to top
And take this building down 'cause that's the only way you're wrecking shop
