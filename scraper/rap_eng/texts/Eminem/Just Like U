[Intro: Eminem]
Daddy?

[Hook: Kids] (4X)
I wanna be just like you
When I grow up, yes I do

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
You don't wanna be just like your daddy
Pimpin' hoes out here drivin' Caddies
Runnin' 'round town, fuckin' with skeezers
Shots in your ass, catchin' diseases
Son, your daddy got a foul mouth
From fuckin' bitches in they foul mouths
I can't help it, my group's D12
All we do is pop pills and stay in jail
Talkin' nasty shit, Bizarre won't stop
I'll fuck two twins, with a midget on top
A sick mind, rapin' an old lady
Knowin' damn well Bizarre shouldn't have a baby
All I can teach you, learn how to mac
Smoke crack, smack a bitch when she talk back
Matter fact, smack your sister, she's a slut
Don't you realize Bizarre don't give a fuck

[Hook] (4X)

[Verse 2]
Don't go to school, become a Catholic priest
Sell crack to your Auntie Denise
If Auntie Denise is short forty cent
Make her get on the ground and {suck} some more {dick}
Nas is gon' probably hate me
When Mos Def hear this he probably gon' suffocate me
Why they let Bizarre rap on Hi-Tek track?
All he gon' do is talk about hoes and smoking crack
If your wife is pregnant I call her a whore
Leave her no money and go out on tour
Nah, I'm playing leave her something
I pack a hot dog and a fucking dirty muffin
You're my son, I'm trying to teach you somethin'
You're {eight} years old? It's time to start fuckin'
You know daddy won't give you the wrong advice
Smoke weed and listen to Obie Trice

[Hook] (8X)

[Outro]
All I can tell you how to do is pop pills and stay high
And tell a bitch to suck a dick
I'm a parent, yeah
A motherfuckin' role model
Hi-Tek
