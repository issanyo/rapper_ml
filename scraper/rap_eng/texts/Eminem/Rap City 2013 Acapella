Role Model?
I'll roll a model down a hill over broke bottles and coke products if she don't suck
And ? To the bumper hit the throttle while im tryna hit the pothose
I'll freakin take Madonna to McDonalds
Any ho in the porizontal getting fondeled
I don't cuddle I don't caddal
Only models that I follows
Everything I drive, whether it's a navo-ho or tatho
It's got a ho in it
Nah ho I don't got no freakin Bronco
You're looking for a buck? Get a horse ? tano
I got a rusty Honda with some bonda and a box of condoms
Little blonde Bitch Fuck me? Fuck you too
Like a Mcbanaro-boo-abano
And I ain't from this planet so nano - nano nano
I'm intolerable, too vilatle, screw it
I don't gotta make the Honor roll to be On a roll
I don't know much, But what I do know I do it pronto though
So knock it off all these knock-off me's
The last thing the world needs is another me
But if you think, this is part 2 to recovery
Or Love the way you lie part 12
Or something Heartfelt you're about to make a Discovery
Like you failed Christopher Columbus's compass
Aint dumbing shit down for you dumb motherfuckers so suck it
I took your best punchline like a punch in the stomach that punctured a lung punk but I'm still functioning from it
Chump, this is nothing now watch, while i fuck one up it and toot my horn
Once i think of something to trumpet
And i don't need a fucking In-strument to sound off like a trunk of a elephant the triumphent
Return of the ether spittin' retard, reborn, but chances of you having another rebirth, slim to none
Like a skinny Mother Theresa, Give a fuck it's easter! So kiss my keester! Because that's the only thing i turn the other cheek for !
