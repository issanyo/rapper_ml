[Intro]
Yeah, Shady
Aftermath
G-UNIT!

[Hook]
I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you
I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you

[Verse 1]
You mistakin' me for somebody that you should be testin'
You should be stressin', I'm finna fuckin' teach you a lesson
Rap 101's in session, Em laced the track that I'm blessin'
Smith & Wesson's the weapon in case you was guessin' (God, damn)
Cappin' 'em, kept in my Benz, hot beginning to end
Watch the 22's spin, my hoes they perfect ten
I got shot up but I got up and I'm back at it again
Motherfuckers that thought I wouldn't win pretend to be friends
At first you fail, try, try, try, try again
I'm the best, don't you get it? Forget it, when I spit it, it's crazy
You love it, admit it, you like that I live it, it's Shady
Aftermath in yo' ass, bitch!
If it's not a classic when it's done we trash it
Flow I got it mastered, stunt and get yo' ass kicked, bastard
When measures get drastic, Glocks made out of plastic
Cock it, aim it, blast it, run nigga, now stash it

[Hook]
I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you
I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you

[Bridge]
If there's a genie in a bottle of that Dom Perignon
I'ma drink 'til I get to that bitch
Em and Dre gonna introduce me to the 'burbs
They gonna listen to my words
In the hood they feel my shit (Break it down!)

[Verse 2]
Picture a perfect picture, picture me in a pimp hat
Picture me startin' shit, picture me bustin' my gat
Picture police mad, they ain't got a picture of that
Picture me bein' broke, picture me smokin' a stack
Picture me comin' up, picture me rich from rap
Picture me blowin' up, now picture me goin' back
To my momma basement to live, shit, picture that
Where I'm from it's a fact, you gotta watch your back
You wear a vest without a gat, you's a target, Jack
Hustle hard, money stack, sell that dope, sell that crack
Sell that pack, sell that gat, sell that pussy, holla back
50 Cent, too much Henny, man I'm bent, I'm outta here

[Hook]
I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you
I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you

[Outro]
Haha, man, I ain't' goin' to jail, not even to visit a nigga
You wanna holler at me you write me
Matter of fact you gotta send it to Sunset Blvd up in the Mondrian
Hahaha, ridin' around in one of Dre's Ferrari's, nigga
Oh, matter fact, I might be in Detroit ridin' down 8 Mile Road
You know, in one of Em's joints and shit, ya heard?
I got places to go, man, ya know
Shady Aftermath, we finna start printin' money
Puttin' Em's faces on these motherfuckin' bills, shit
Hahaha, ain't shit you can do about it
