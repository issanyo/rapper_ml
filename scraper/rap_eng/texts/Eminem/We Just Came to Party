[Intro: Young Zee]
Yeah, Young Zee, Eminem
Talk to..
What up [?]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Young Zee]
Usually it's beef the more the merry
Me and Em fill up a thousand mortuaries
Till ain't no more room in them cemeteries
And all ya fake mens is dead and buried
But tonight man-

[Chorus: Eminem ]
We just came to party
We ain't come in here to start shit wit nobody
Girl we just wanna see you work that, work that body
With your man lookin' like he could murk somebody
He just sipped a lil bit too much Bacardi
He done tripped into this cup and spilt it on me
Now he’s startin to talk shit to Swift and [?]
He’s about to get the shit kicked in, stomped out him

[Verse 1: Young Zee]
Zee come get the riches
That's how come I drop [?] filled wit sixes
Only bonin' one chick cuz hoes be lyin'
Fuck around and end up like Kobe Bryant
I just came to drink a thousand shots of Rémy
You gon' make me fuck around and pop the semi
Man I live two lives, I roll wit stars to open bars
In the hood we still ride around in stolen stolen cars
Pop shit, I’ll put this gun on yo earing
Till I hear that loud tune and voice disappearing
It’s Crow, man I get high off water
Wake up in the bed wit Ozzie Ozbourne's daughter
Test us, better give a vest to your wife
Or when I said it you’ll regret it for the rest of your life
Yeah, we roll up on a gang of harleys
Zee, Slim Shady, we just came to party man

[Chorus: Eminem]

[Verse 2: Young Zee]
Even though niggas know we down with Shady
Me and Saph, we still got them pounds of eighty
Purple heads bring me dough like it's chips from rappin
Make me look like all my records platinum
And I ain't dropped, when I do just rap at mama
I make a nigga fall off like Cappadonna
Yeah, in the club, don't treat me like a lame in the game
'Fore my lil niggas whip out, aim for your chain
Mad cuz we blessed to them things yall wish
We buy new cars, gut em' out like they fish
Yeah, we don't give a fuck what you say
We got those tech nines like [?] and [?]
Folks tell me slow down, I'm spendin' all my dough up
So what? I throw twenty-fo's on the tow truck
They think we bought no guns what you think?
But we ain't come to fight, we just came to drink man

[Chorus: Eminem]

[Verse 3: Young Zee]
When I roll out to the club with all my soldiers
I can get about a thousand heads and loaders
Right through the front door with all them toasters
They don’t search us, it's Crow them niggas know us
And nobody in the world on the mic can see me
I just spit hot flow and write graffiti
And I roll with mass spanish cats that be acting black
Pimped out caddilacs and they pack them macs
Pop the ignition in your limited edition
Get it come through spinning it, in the intersection
It's chrome, no gold, $300 dollar jeans
Smack their [?] DJ like I’m drama king
Fuck with that nigga the gats gon spill
I drive off in somethin' look like the batmobile, but chill
We just came to chill, money chill, we just came to chill, go!

[Chorus: Eminem]

[Outro: Young Zee]
Oh, oh it's on
