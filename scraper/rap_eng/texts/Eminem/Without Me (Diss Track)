[Intro 1]
It's been about one month since your boy had fun
Now everybody gather 'round, it's time to hurt someone, I said
It's been about one month since your boy had fun
Now everybody gather 'round, it's time to hurt someone, I said

[Intro 2]
Guess who's back, back again
Crypt is back, tell a friend
Crypt is back, Crypt is back
Crypt is back, Crypt is back
Crypt is back, Crypt is back
Crypt is back

[Verse 1]
I've been missing this rap shit, 'cause no one can
Master the fast add libbing rap, that is lashed by this fat kid
Yea we got these faggots out here thinking they can rap
When in fact they lack the passion to mash this
With a savage flow, time to harass these hoes
And Ima show you motherfuckers I'm a natural
Because I spit the truth like two dudes in a Ruckus
I ain't holding nothing back, time to toughen up and say fuck it
Calling out Bryan Le, “Mr. Lying through your face”
How the fuck you white as day, when you were living with Sommer Rays?
Stuck in the friend zone, no game like a rain delay
And your shit flow, separated by the phrase "aye!"
That's rap 101, when you're stunned and don't know what to say
Use a time separation to call dudes gay
Your rhyme scheme is basic like a white chick
With a face lift and pumpkin spice to her lips
And now Ricegum is out here tripping on acid
'Cause IDubbz kicked his ass into a casket
And now it's my turn to bring him down six feet
You can't put a man in a crypt without me

[Hook]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2]
Now we got Keemstar thinkin' that he's got bars
Apart from the bars, he stars in with hard liquor
He ain’t got the goods, so take your dollar in the woods
And vanish quicker than your subs, when you called Alex a [...] Hey!
And i am not fan of boy in a band looking like Skrillex
I see right through you like acrylic
Your rhymes are weaker than villains against heros of the village
Take some advil and just chill
I’m iller than what penicillin could get rid of in a minute
Ima knock you off your rocker like a proper dude rapping
The world can call you Papa Doc, but you’re fucking with me, B-Rabbit
Motherfuckers I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
I won’t let a bitch ruin this young and up and comer
Kiwiz told me: **“Dude you gotta make this thing your bitch
Focus on yourself, I went through the same shit you did”**
So I need to slit her throat and toss her ass in a ditch
And find the hick she cheated on me with and rip off his dick?
**“No Crypt, I never said any of that
Just bust out your raps
Show these motherfuckers you’re back in the saddle again
The return to Y-T”**
‘Cause it feels so empty without me


[Hook]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3]
They say hell hath no fury like a woman’s scorn
But they never met a man, who’s been broken and torn
By a whore, who swore she adored you and wanted nothing more
Told the lord he’s the one I’ve been looking for
I’ve been broken hearted torn apart and ripped into pieces
While you were sucking someone else’s dick, it’s time to get even
I said your left titty’s bigger than the right one
I would imagine someone else when you were on my dick, and I’d cum
And I only wanted head to give you lockjaw
So you’d stop talking about the awful bitches in the office
I promise, they aren’t the only ones who hated you
‘Cause you 27 other exes who evaded too
I made a song for you a couple days ago and you rejected it
And then said if you listen to it, it will end our friendship
Well fuck our friendship and fuck you too bitch
I can’t believe I almost let you ruin Crypt
Now a month has gone by, and I am doing great
While the guy you left me for is on a different date
Now you cry at night all alone at home
Hoping the phone will show a number you know, but it won’t
Because I’m busy killing life and now I’m busting out rhymes
I bought a box of Trojans yesterday
And now that shit is dry
Now your life is sad and full of misery
And you deserve every bit of it without me

[Hook]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Outro]
Hum dei dei la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la
Hum dei dei la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la
