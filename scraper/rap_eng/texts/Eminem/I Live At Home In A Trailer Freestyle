Well Jimmy moved in with his mother
Cuz he ain't got no place to go

[Jimmy]
And now I'm right back in the gutter
With a garbage bag that's full of clothes

[Future]
Cuz you live at home in a trailer
What the hell you gonna do?

[Jimmy]
Cuz I live at home in a trailer
Mom I'm coming home to you

Well my names Jimmy, and his name's Greg Buel
And me him and you went to the same school
This ain't cool, I'm in a rage
He tapping my mom, we're almost the same age!
On the microphone I drop bombs
Look at this car, thanks a lot mom!
"Here happy birthday Rabbit
Here's a brand new car, you can have it"
A 1928 delta, this shit won't even get me to the shelter!
And I can't even say I'm from Motown
Cause I'm back in the 8-1-0 now

Cuz I live at home in a trailer
Mom I'm coming home to you
