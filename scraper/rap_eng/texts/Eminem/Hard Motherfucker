Uh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah
Uh huh yeah
Check it out

[Verse]
Well here I am and I came to say
It's a devastating rhyme and it goes this way
Everybody knows that I ain't no sucker
Cause I am one hard motherfucker
Cause I'm the baddest, and that is my status
And right now, yo, I'm 'bout to show you what phat is
Phat is getting off my damn job
Because I'm phat like a hamhock
And yo-yo with the damn clock
Cause I'm the fuckin' man that you like to hear
When I'm bustin' out a rhyme in your atmosphere
But right now I'm 'bout to grab my nuts
Fuck around and say shit all night just to strut
So here I go like Robert Dinero
You know that I ain't nobodies hero
Cause I'm the man, so motherfuckin' hard
Sendin' motherfuckers to the goddamn graveyard
Oh I know you like the that I
Have the ability on the track to punch you in the eye
Blam, bloaw, boom, slash
You know that I just smash, trash
Your whole damn crew, your whole damn life
Then I'll fuck your goddamn motherfuckin' wife
I'll take her in the backroom, I'll take her in the bathroom
And that bitch can suck on my nuts like a vacuum
Ooh, I'm hard
