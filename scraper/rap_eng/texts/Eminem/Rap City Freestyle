High on? What'd you say, trick? What am I on?
Two tubes of airplane glue and a can of Krylon
Eatin' a crayon, settin' fire to rayon
Flamin' the nylons of two white lesbians screamin', "Die, blondes"
Strike matches on white patches of dry lawns
And I run and jump right in front of the fire hydrants
Five blunts, and you expect me to die once
With nine lives, fuckin' chickens in front of my blind wives?
Suicidal, my friends tell me to try knives
You wanna mess with a mothafucka who skydives
Out of a plane to give the Statue of Liberty high fives?
Doin' drive-bys and miss you with five tries
It's Slim Shady and BET and Big Tigger, all y'all who see me flee
