[Intro: Fred Durst and Eminem]
Uh
Aiight
Check
Slim, Shady, through the mic kid, Uh
Slim Shady, Oh

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
From a slip disk from a Limp Bizkit disk
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts
So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit
Little rich kids in cribs don't attempt this shit
So step back while I prep up to pimp this bitch
So I say to the girl, I'm like, "What up, girl? Shut up, girl!"
Then I showed her a cut up squirrel
She screamed "bloody murder" so loud everybody heard her
She slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer
I moved on to two blondes kissin' on a futon
"Yo, baby, what are you on?"
I looked at 'em both and I was like, "Look
Check this out, toots, I'm lookin' for Cookie Puss
I need to speak to him immediately
They played my video on MTV last week"
And just when I was thinking I was all that and then some
Here comes Fred Durst, "Now Shady, let me get some"

[Verse 2: Fred Durst]
Who knows what galaxy I came from?
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare, you stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single
See, me and Shady, I think we got it locked down
Shocked by the sound, I got you crusin' with your top down
These two blondes I offered them both a drink
And this you would think could get the party started
But instead the girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouth, smelled like somebody farted
So it was time for me to move on
Shady said the living room was a dance floor
So turn me loose, I was cuttin' the rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was a drunk and a prick
Rambling on about how he was gonna kill me, wow!
I spilled a drink on his shirt
But no, he insisted we should go
And before I could drop him, Shady had to clock him
The music stopped, the party stood in shock
I looked around, grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf

[Hook]
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's going my way
Or no way at all
Why don't you...

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Turn me loose
You better tell them to come reshingle the roof
‘Cause just keep giving me free drinks 'til I puke
Then Fred will ask me to lead sing in his group
I'm sitting at the bar and I'm not being approached
‘Cause Fred's over there stealing all of my hoes
"Yo, Fred, save me some"
I walked to these siamese twins
And asked to have a threesome
I told them two heads are better than one
Plus I respect how y'all roll together as one
Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin
Stood up, like, "Wait, where are you goin'?!"
Well, three strikes and I'm out
And I just struck out two times in a row (Ow!)
I ain't trying no more, fuck it, I'm chillin'
Did a shot of Jäger, fell asleep on the ceiling
