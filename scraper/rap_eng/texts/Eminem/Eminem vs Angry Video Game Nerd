[Intro]
EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!
EMINEM!
VERSUS
ANGRY VIDEO GAME NERD, BEGIN!

[Verse 1: Angry Video Game Nerd]
You know what's bullshit? Eminem's songs
They're like, really fucking shitty, and they last long
I would rather have a diarrhea milkshake laced with vomit!
And on it, more vomit, yeah vomit, yeah vomit!
SHIT! HOLY FUCK! IT'S ACTUALLY MARSHAL MATHERS!
RAPPING ABOUT HIS PAST LIFE LIKE IT ACTUALLY FUCKING MATTERS!
I'D RATHER PLAY SUPERMAN 64, THEN BANG THAT STUPID HAILIE WHORE!
YEA, HEARD ME RIGHT, I CALLED HER A WHORE, I'LL SHIT ON YOUR FACE WHILE YOU'RE ON THE FLOOR!
Get ready to be taken back to the past
I am going to kick your ass

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Venom! I'm gonna hit you with the venom, venom!
Go wear some denim, bet 'em, I'm about to go get 'em, venom!
And there just ain't no tellin', what I'll be doing with my venom!
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em! Venom! VENOM!
Donald Trump's a sexist pig, Donald Trump's a racist dick
Donald Trump's a fucking rapist and a little bitch
He wants to deport every non-white person, and worsen
The United States of America, he should put the makeup back in the purse, and
I got a dinner that is way better than yours
At least mine wasn't made by a wife that is a WHORE!
Your movie needed some cheap tricks, it made E.T fake
So now I'll kill and leave you rotting like Zander's birthday cake
Stop fucking drinking beer! It's not good for you!
Take a sip of this G Fuel, and you'll be cool, booze is only made for those who are fools!
I'm Eminem, I'm better than this fucking dumbass piece of shit homosexual
How you gonna call yourself a nerd when you don't know the definition of "intellectual"?

[Bridge: Kyle Justin & Eminem]
He's the angriest man alive
He's so angry, he beats up his own wife
His kids were taken away for life
He's the angriest man alive
SHUT UP!
(How would the music, how-how would the music be?
I would go, tha-tha-tha takes me
How would the music, how-how would the music be?
I would go, that just takes me)

[Verse 3: Angry Video Game Nerd]
Grrrr, I'm getting NERD RAGE!
I need to cool off with the movie ICE AGE!
I'm fuckin tired of this faggot always crying about his life
He's like "Weh, Donald Trump, grr my daughter, I FUCKING HATE MY WIFE!"
You made a song about your dead fan? What were you fucking thinking?
Dissing me and my beer, son? What are you fucking drinking?
While I'm hanging out with Bugs, Ninja, Jason, Freddy, and Spiderman
THIS OLD MAN CRINKLES MORE THAN ZANDER'S SPRITE CANS!
Ass. FUUUUUUUCK!

[Verse 4: Eminem]
That's it
James Rolfe, stop being lame, Rolfe!
You said the same shit yesterday, Rolfe!
You almost got killed by a little ROB bitch yea, your life almost got fucking robbed, bitch
Played his damn game, then you fucking dropped, bitch like Biggie Smalls, X, and 2Pac, bitch
Die, bitch! Like Stanley, man, you ain't manly man, you're candy man
You're angry man, and I'm furious, take this fucking battle serious
You're delirious, and hideous, wake up, fuck, wipe up the period
People say that I'm getting old but look at you, where did their hair go?
I said, knock knock, let the Devil in
I'm better than you and your fat cocked friend Mike combined, no competitive
Battling you is repetitive, you winning this is a fat negative
I'm Eminem, I like M&M's, and taking wins from my nemesis
If you like playing shitty games so much, then I got a request for you!
Review Red Dead 2
Yeah, Revival was pretty bad but uh, not my bird!
Game over AVGN, now I'm gonna say the N WORD!

[Outro: Eminem & Angry Video Game Nerd]
Who won? Who's next? (AAH)
You decide! (Ah)
Epic Rap Battles of (I have gamer rage) History!
AAAAAAAH!
My fucking throat hurâ€”

[Video Outro: Eminem]
WHAT A BUNCH OF SHIT FUCK! *keyboard slam*
