[Verse 1: Redman]
Word is bond, Redman makes the kids run
I'm seeing dead people creepin' on my income
Piercing the ear drums, how the fuck he do it?
Got little miniature Redmans, crawlin' into it, cause my
Back against the wall get to actin' like a fool
That's what happens to students, when you keep 'em after school
I stay a wild child, beef, bring it like "Raow! Raow!"
My guns go boom, boom, and your guns go pow pow!
Still, I feel a chill, bumps in my body
The spirits of other MC's records in the party
Cause, me being, the man that I am
I'm awfully hunted by them guns with wide lens on the scope
Sucka, you miss, I'm a get my laugh on
You fuck around and woke up, with the stash gone
How I spaz on niggas is ugly
You got the game fucked up on makin' the money
See I don't say I'm thugged out, but I know my choice
Back up plans, got back up; if I blow my voice
That's why I'm Brick City, can't wait to put my niggas on
To see us perform, we sellin' out at Ticket Tron
What I'm doing is wrong, but It lasts long
Yo, toast the niggas that passed on
Get it while the gettin good, whole life with a grip
Cause when it's gone, that's it, that's it, that's it!

[Hook 2X]
I'm seeing dead people creepin on my income
You win some, you lose some, but you never run

[Verse2: Redman]
(Yo what's on, come on)
Redman it's the war head; BOOM!
Nigga I don't die, I was born dead
Top of the mornin' to ya, I wake up like a born loser
The world is my Bermuda; Triangle and I'm lost in it
I'm hearin' voices saying "Red, the wanna put holes in ya authentic"
I walk among winners and I put out work, nigga
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Haters hate on, you can tell the rest of the class
I can see the evil in you, through a masculine task
Smoke the greenest grass I live by the hand of god
That me, ya boys, or ya guns won't leave a scar
You niggas too hard and not ready to scrap
Knowin' damn well, ya moms raised you better than that
Redman the weirdo, I'm my own dirty clique
With 35 KO's nigga I'll make it 36!

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 3: Redman]
Thou shall not fuck with raw, Funk Docta
Takin' ya breath when I drop ya
I feel for you cause cats, try to test me
You a waiteress set of an MC, check please
Been waited way too long, now it's time to put Gilla on the map
Gilla on ya back, same Zombies, from Phila on attack
Niggas want it back, Triggas on the map
Won't stop me, I'm not a quitter that's a rap
If I was just broke you wouldn't notice me
Ha, Ha, but look at the bright side my man
Nobody really planned to fail, you really failed the plan
Gotta keep the bomb like an Israeli hand
My music's killa, your's girlie; Scram!
I can hang out in the same place as my fans
Let 'em touch me, feel how far that I swam
Look in my eyes, ya noddin to sleep
It ain't a watch, as Eminem, providin the beat
That's why..

[Hook 4X]
