[verse 1: Eminem]
Lights, action, cameras flashing
Managers, sponsors, concerts, monster mashing
Flashing type of mic
That was unaware of trash like Marilyn Manson
Updated Axle Rose
White version of shaft pimp slappin' hoes
Pull up like a Mac, jet black limo
Strecth so far back you can't see the back windows
Stepping out pink hats, furs and minks
Chicks on each arm, what the fuck you think?
Right arm go that kid from N'Sync's chick on it
Left arm got that little pink chick on it
Me and Dre at the VMA's again
Pissin' off all these lesbians and gays again

[Verse 2: Proof]
Let me show you what the clip does
Cause D12 are harder than virgins inside strip clubs
Yo, we bust thugs
You beatin us is like 20 inch doves on glove buzz
It won't happen don't take the satisfaction
With funk flex you got your back spittin'
Actin' like you harder than life
Peace to Obie Trice
Rock a mic is on the right
Obie Trice has been around the globe twice
How it feel with the shine show was
Peace to Mark Labelle, Flex and Paul Rosenburg
Yo Em Diddy save me
Ayo, I think my dad's going crazy
