[Eminem (Sway & King Tech)]
It's like that (Uh, Eminem...Eminem)
Alright bust it (What)

[Eminem]
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a two by four board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella to mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Gotcha locked in a cellar with your skeleton showin'
Developin' anorexia- while I'm standing next to ya
Eatin' a four-course meal watching you starve to death
Put a IV in ya vein feeding you liquid Darvaset
Pumpin' you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on a gunshot victim full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up by an ambulance and driven to receiving
With they asses ripped out of they pants
And given a less than twenty percent chance of living
Havin' a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storin' the dead bodies in grandma's lil' basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy
On you while you scream "I'm still alive!"
Drivin' a rusty scalpel through the top of ya scalp
I'm pullin' ya Adam's apple out through ya mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arsonist
To set fire to carpet and burn up your entire apartment
