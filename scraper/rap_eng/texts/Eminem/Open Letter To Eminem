Open Letter To Eminem

Hook
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day
I drift away and put them on
Cause I don’t really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
(so this is my cassette I'm sending you I hope you hear it)

Verse 1
Dear Mr Mathers
You’re my favorite rapper
When I tell my friends I get chuckles and laughter
I wonder what's the matter
Then we start to debate
I say they don't understand half the shit that you make
And skills that it takes
To create the rhymes you lay
You're above all these rappers
Even when you play
No I'm not a STAN
See I understand
The technique
Don't sweat it
Just know I get it
Make something for the mainstream then
Make something for your core audience
See I think that it's ill how you showcase your skills
With radio appeal
You deserve every mil
But that's not the reason why you do it
Cause music is therapeutic how you use it
Make something I can feel
Channeling all your skills
Challenging all your peers
I hear you crystal clear
Mr. Mathers

Verse 2
Dear Mr Shady
I hope you really take me
Serious cause silence is making me crazy
Can’t you see for your record label
I’m the perfect fit
These other rappers out now
Ain't really worth a shit
They all sound the same
Rapping with half a brain
I know I can make a change
I just need to catch a break
How sway please tell me how sway
Don’t want to throw any shade
I've been begging for 45 days
To showcase my skills
Beats are getting killed
Rappers getting grilled
Asking for the cypher so you know I'm ill
Not afraid to spit
On the spot I prove my wits
Doing things my favorite rapper did
I just want a chance to prove myself
Hit the booth and Lose myself
Nobody can do me better than who
Myself
So I take this opportunity to say
Shady you can save me
Like you got saved by Dr. Dre

Hook

Verse 3
Dear Mr Eminem
Can't you tell I’m better than
99 percent of these rappers with a pen
My whole life I've been battling
To perfect my craft
To the point I scribble jams
Now my backpacks filled with gems
Hit records I've been sitting on
For the day I'm getting on
Please take a second to hear my song
Why haven't you respond
Should I get the duct tape
Hey what's up Dre
Got a new roommate
For the basement that you're staying in
I'm just being Real Slim
Please hear me out
Em
You can be my Dre
Or
You can be the Jay
And I can be your YE
Many paths my career could take
We had to meet this way
I believe this is faith
You just need to see it
Oh year you can't speak
So you best get to blinking
You ready here's a phone
Time to call Paul
You better read this all
I'm finally getting signed y'all
