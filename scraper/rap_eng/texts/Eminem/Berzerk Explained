Music.

I had met Paul, Em's manager, a few years ago and we always talked about the possibility of getting together to work on something at some point down the road. We just worked out it was meant to be at this time. I think it's unlike any current hip hop songs. If you listen to what's going on in hip hop, this is not what this is. Em wanted to do something kind of throwback to some of the early records that we were making in the old days. And it more reflects that energy of the early days of hip hop.

We were in the studio working on a bunch of different ideas and this was one of the later ones to come up. It started with a sample and the sample that we started with ended up not being in the record. The song sort of evolves. It started one way, it kind of got programmed and written to and then it changed into a whole different song.

And I felt the track was really strong and didn't really know what direction Em was gonna go in vocally. And then when I heard the vocals, that was pretty, exciting because it was not at all what I was expecting. And just the energy in it and the lyrics and the style of it. It's so well done and so smart and so funny. It's just great. In this song, we ended up using a wired guitar and hook and everything else pretty much is programmed.

It reminds me of old hip hop videos and I think it's really entertaining and I look forward to see it all put together and done. But in the shooting stages, the pieces I've seen look really entertaining.
