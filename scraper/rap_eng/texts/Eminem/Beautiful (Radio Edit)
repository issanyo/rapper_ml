Intro:
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, then I'm reaching out for you

Verse 1:
I'm just so fucking depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick that mic back up
I don't know how or when
And I ended up in this position I'm in
I starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and tried to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips
With the fact that
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
I know some shits so hard to swallow
And I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
Copy
One tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you have to walk a thousand miles

Pre Chorus 1:
In my shoes, just to see
What it's be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

Chorus 1:
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, o-o-o-o-h
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, o-o-o-o-h
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh

Verse 2:
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature at a room
Just as soon
As I walk in
It's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation, like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking manservant
Follow me around, and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like
Haah Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't have to trade our shoes
And you don't have to walk no thousand miles

Pre Chorus 2:
In my shoes, just to see
What it's be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

Chorus 2:
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, o-o-o-o-h
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, o-o-o-o-h
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh

Outro:
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, then I'm reaching out for you
