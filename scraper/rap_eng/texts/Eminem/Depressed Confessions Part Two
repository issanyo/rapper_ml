Yeah
It's been five years since part one
To be honest brah most days I still feel the same
It is what it is man

Depressed Confessions Part Two
Yo

[Verse]
Every day repeats and I just cannot get away
In every way I'm weak I wanna leave and just forget this pain
Memories engraved have left me mentally insane and every day I wake up praying that my family will change
It's hard to accept this fate, I know I'm not meant for this life and ever since the day of my birth I have been ready to die
I've severed all ties with anyone I've ever loved and look inside my eyes it's not hard to tell that my head is fucked
Destined for drugs I'm not supposed to prevail so fuck even trying to change when I just know that I'll fail
I'm hopeless and frail, unstable ready to snap, understand that once I turn that I can never come back
Just like my dad I see myself, every time that I look at him it fuckin makes me sad I wanna cry because he looks so sick
But I hold it in that's why I'm such an angry kid and if you've never seen me lose it you don't know what anger is
I let aggression out by putting blades against my wrist, I'll cave in the fuckin heads of people I'm not friendly with
Upon my enemies it's death I wish, sounds harsh but reality is so don't judge me for why my head's like this
The devil is in the same place where my mental is, burning in the flames of hell cursed for eternity
I believe I don't deserve to breathe I wish I could take the life I have and give it to the one who nurtured me
She raised five kids under one roof, mum if you can hear this just know there's no other like you
I know what you've been through and everything you have seen
You're so strong even though you are sick with disease and living with me is what has made you [?] peace
Forgiveness ain't free and for you I'm fuckin willing to bleed
If that's the price to pay I'll die today, willingly leave so you can fly away to brighter days and live on your feet
This is real talk and it's hard to speak what is real but I have to let it out cause it's too hard to keep it concealed
So to my older brothers, Jesse and Luke I know I act like I hate you both but I just pretend that I do
And my message to you is that acceptance is hard and watchin your lights fade inside has left me empty and dark
I'm bent from my past and I'll know I'll never be straight
A crooked mind I'm on my own no one will ever relate
Until I'm sent to my grave I'll fight this war by myself and I don't want any sympathy I'm not here crying for help
My mind is a cell I'm trapped and sentenced to life, stuck in a mental prison where negative energy thrives
I'm on the edge of a knife and I'm ready to fall, you see I'll never fly or ever see the heavenly doors
Preparin for war every day's a fight for me inside of me I'm battling depression, bipolar and anxiety
In search for sobriety I have become lost, that's the price to pay for addiction it comes at a cost
I'm fucked from the bongs, crack pipes have left me a wreck and pickin up the pipe is something I'll forever regret
I don't have any energy left, I'm sick of livin of Centrelink and paying off my tick with my rent assist
I'm on the list for mental benefits so I don't have to look for work or ever pay for any medicine
Our time on earth is never definite I'm ready I could leave in any sec end it all and just forget this shit
My death would be so effortless I'd just take drugs, pop a hundred xannies fall asleep and never wake up, my eyes forever stay shut
This is real life what I'm saying isn't made up, I don't say lies
But I'm surrounded by people who do and it's only when the smokes clears you see who is true
But fuck mates all I need is a bueg and a halfa and I'll be fine I'll live my life happily ever after
So if you think you know me you better think again, cause I can never be the person that you think I am
Cause I can never be the person that you think I am
So if you think you know me you better think again, cause I can never be the person that you think I am
