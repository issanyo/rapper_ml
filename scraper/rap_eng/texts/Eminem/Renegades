[Verse 1: Royce]
It's several different levels to picking up shovels
And dumping you in ditches under sea level
Front and you can witness
Let me refreshen you niggas, tell you my position in this
(Ch-chk!) Beef! Leave you under Venice, opposition finished
Here it is, we invaded, created a pyramid
Of a Haven of names, so blame Dre, and that ear of his
So (ah-ha, ah-ha) breathe, I'd rather reach for your neck
And I never heat you for respect, unless you greet me with less
I got a skunk in my trunk, I'm lying, I got a pump in my trunk
You dying, how many lumps niggas want?
Who's ready for y'all? We ready for y'all
We too incredibly raw for any artist that said he would draw
I stand firm, and it hurts to live it
You open that can of worms
I hope you ready for the dirt that's with it
Slap a ho, snatch a mic
Being brought to y'all in black and in white
(It's the new!) Joe Jackson and Ike
We renegades

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
‘Cause see, they call me a menace
And if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference
They're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Nah, nah, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned
And keep your ears glued to the stereo
'Cause, here we go: He's Royce, he's the King of Detroit
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a—

[Hook: Eminem]
—renegade!
Never been afraid to say what's on my mind
At any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?) Anything
'Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to say what's on my mind
At any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?) Anything (Anything)

[Verse 3: Royce]
I determine what time it's on, I call my nigga Proof
Hand him a pint of Limon and turn him loose
I'm tired of you new jacks, I'm tired of niggas that's like (I'm 'bout to blow)
Unless you a bitch, we don't care if you 'bout do that
Move back, youngster, the Glock gon' speak
Chew up your vest and turn your chest hair to taco meat
The street, continuous to pit, quick to smash ya
Or flash the clip, or give you the picture, develop the
Click clock, six shots blows through another door
And it gets hot, Hip-hop Quotable tug of war
Who did you niggas' beats, you bitches, who made it work?
That shit was *pfft* — I got harder two-way alerts
Just when I thought my dog couldn't get any meaner
You talk about his daughter, he probably go get you the nina
You talk about his momma, he won't even give you the finger
(He's crazy) Deranged, not media eaters, we renegades

[Verse 4: Eminem]
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the King of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
As a monger of hate and Satan, a scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's as easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie
While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers
'Cause I'm a motherfuckin'—
