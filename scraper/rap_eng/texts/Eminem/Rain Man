[Intro]
Yeah
Definitely, definitely
Definitely dope
Definitely
Definitely K-Mart
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You find me offensive
I find you offensive for finding me offensive
Hence, if I should draw out or line any fences
If so, to what extents if any should I go
'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive psychological
Nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths, this far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too God damned sensitive
It's censorship, and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now, 'cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I
Had one of those twenty-five cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must've put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault, 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman, I killed Super-man, and how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you, hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Verse 2]
Now in the bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed, have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad
As long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before during or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids, in a more derogatory way
But who's to say, what's fair to say and what not to say
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre (What up?)
I got a question if I may (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt butt when he tees off (Yeah)
But, but, I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hut-hut
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant, it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped, and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details, but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then, I'll just walk around with a manly strut, because

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you, hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Verse 3]
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spider-Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whoop ass canister
Goddammit Dre, where's the God damned beat (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yup yup, don't worry, I'm on it
I got it, high-five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can
And zoom, I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
And I don't even gotta make no God damned sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you, hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Outro]
'Cause ah ha ha ha ha
Yup, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre
Super dope beat maker
Two thousand, two thousand four-hundred and eighty-seven million, nine hundred and se-seventy-three thousand four hundred and sixty-three... and seventy
(Yeah)
