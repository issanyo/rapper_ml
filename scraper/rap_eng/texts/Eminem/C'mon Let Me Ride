[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
If you got a sweet tooth, you can taste my watermelons
If the swingset bores you, I can show you all my talents
I can wear a tan, like other bitches can't
You can have all this, boy
And there's only one thing that I want from you

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Come on, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical, on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it's only natural
I feel it comin', comin', comin', ohh
I feel it runnin', runnin', runnin', ohh
Come on, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical, on your bicycle

[Hook 2: Eminem]
You want to ride my bicycle
You want to ride my bike, ha ha

[Verse 2: Skylar Grey]
If the world starts freezing, I can make it hot and humid
If you get a bee sting, I can suck out all the poison
I can make you last, like other bitches can't
Have I made it clear, boy?
There's only one thing that I want from you

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Come on, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical, on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it's only natural
I feel it comin', comin', comin', ohh
I feel it runnin', runnin', runnin', ohh
Come on, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical, on your bicycle

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
I'm only fucking with you
Fuck you for thinking it's true
I'm not like the sluts in this town
They make me blehh in my mouth
I wanna ride on your bike
‘Cause you're the boy that I like
It's like I'm a sell-out for you
But your bike's so shiny and new

[Verse 3: Eminem]
She's distracted by my reflectors
Man, I can tell the chick's attracted
My wheels spoke to her, my Schwinn is a chick magnet
Bagging up chicks like a bag of chips
With a bag of prophylactics as big as Mick Jagger lips
Shagging is something I'm a pro at, but I ain't practicing shit
Allen Iverson of safe sex
Condoms are for practice, man, I skip practice
Flip backwards while I flip this bike on its banana seat
My fantasy is to have you land where the kickstand is
Got this bitch gaggin', they call me the broad killer
I'm the cousin of Godzilla
‘Cause I spit fire and my dick's draggin'
Zig-zaggin' up the avenue
Pulling these chicks in my antagonist wagon, screaming…

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Come on, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical, on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it's only natural
I feel it comin', comin', comin', ohh
I feel it runnin', runnin', runnin', ohh
Come on, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical, on your bicycle

[Hook 2: Eminem]
You want to ride my bicycle
You want to ride my bike
You want to ride my bicycle
You want to ride my bike, ha ha
