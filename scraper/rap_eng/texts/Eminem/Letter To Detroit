Detroit

There is a resilience that rises from somewhere deep within your streets
You can't define it, but you can feel it
You can feel it overflowing from the people who call you home
From people who are always proud to declare, 'I'm from Detroit'
You took our country from it's infancy, into industry
And your name still carries with it the idea of a nation built on steel, muscle and sweat
You became the city that carried the country
The city, like the sport, is built on dreams
People who would drive to you, driven to excel
Who know nothing is accomplished without hardwork, without sacrifice
When you hurt, we hurt
Your streets witness our struggle
Your bricks are our rage through the emptiness of each house shuttered, of each factory closed
We've lived through the ups and the downs
But we remain, Detroit
We can never turn our backs on you Detroit, because we are you
My home
The home of Motown, Cadillac and Joe Louis
Through all this, we cannot be defeated, because we have never been defeated
You've built us, you've moved us, you've shaped us
Sometimes down, but never out
Take strength in us, your people

Stay up Detroit
