[Spoken: Eminem]
Ayo Paul, it's Em
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing
And I know that he's not "thrilled" about the video
What, does he wanna be startin' somethin'?
Wow, well I'll show him who's really bad {*burps*}

Paul the way you make me feel with these calls
You should really take a look at the man in the mirror
And tell him to beat it because I won't stop till I get enough

Do you remember the time
We were watching the "Billie Jean" video?
Well, he'll always be that Michael to me
And it doesn't matter if he's black or white
Because I can't stop loving him
And I hate plastic surgeons and I hope they all fucking die

How do you like that? And I like him, I like him a lot
I wanna touch him, but I can't {*mouth noises*}
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit, sorry

Anyways, call me back
I have this idea about how I want to end the show
So, hit me when you get this message, fucker
Oh, and by the way, no, I don't have a new gun
{*Gun cracks and bullets fall out*} Goddamn it!
