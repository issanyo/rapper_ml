Everywhere ya folk go they yellin out Stat Quo
Right up the strip that the street niggas fiend for
The a bambino, GMN nino never been faded
You hate it I made it the hoods the ladies
Your rims I dated so get some new ones

All throughout the world girls lovin' my shit

While you waitin' out front we gettin' in for free
