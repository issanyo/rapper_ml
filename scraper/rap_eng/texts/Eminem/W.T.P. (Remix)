*And grab someone*

[Verse 1: Vybz Kartel]

Six pack unda mi sweater but mi nah talk bout nuh abs

Pull up inna di club mi sharper dan a scissors
Gyal ah offer menage a trois an three sums and blow jobs
In condom fi safety like pistols in holsters

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Now you can do this on your own but everyone knows
That no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor (oh) and grab somebody
Ain't nothin but a white trash party (white trash party) (awoah)


[Vybz Kartel]
Street vybz a raise high grade a blaze
Drop di bomb gyal al qaeda ways
Weh di yaad gyal weh di yaad man deh
Kartel ah have a badman party (badman party)


[Verse 2: Eminem (Vybz Kartel)]
Pull a fifth of Bacardi from outta my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head (oh)
(Mix up the street vybz overproof di white di red)
An tomorrow probably still be too high to get outta bed
(Now proably di way mi frass mi neeven recognize ma momma)
Mixin' Hennessey and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta (oh)
(Suh mi fling offa santa wid a thirty-two spanna)
Miss the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders(awoah)
So quit tryin' ta play the wall like you pawlin'
(mi ah di hero di dancehall Marcus Garvey)
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
Cuz as soon as they throw on some R-Kelly I start ballin'(oh)
(Mi dash weh miney pon di gyal dem mi nuh busines)
But I'm not throwin' ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes (mi ah throw nannies)
Man I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's
From the north, east and west(oh), but when
It comes to them trailers in them South Parks
Muffle it, cuz homie that hood's tighter then Kenny's (heh heh)
So ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outie
(Now jump inna di s-class fi dadi
C'mon)

[Eminem]
Now you can do this on your own but everyone knows
That no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin but a white trash party (white trash party) (oh)

[Vybz Kartel]
Street vybz a raise high grade a blaze
Drop di bomb gyal al qaeda ways
Weh di yaad gyal weh di yaad man deh
Kartel ah have a badman party (badman party)


[Bridge]

[Eminem]
Now whether you're black, white or purple
If you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck
You weren't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil
And you're no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your 'hood (ah ah awoah)


[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Now you can do this on your own but everyone knows
That no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin but a white trash party (white trash party) (oh)

[Vybz Kartel]
Street vybz a raise high grade a blaze
Drop di bomb gyal al qaeda ways
Weh di yaad gyal weh di yaad man deh
Kartel ah have a badman party (badman party) (awoah)
Party party party
