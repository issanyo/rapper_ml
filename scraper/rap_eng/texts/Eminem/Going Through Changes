[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Lately I really feel like I'm rollin' for delph like Philly
Feel like I'm losin' control of myself, I sincerely
Apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complainin'
But life keeps on complicatin'
And I'm debatin' on leavin' this world this evenin'
Even my girls can see I'm grievin'
I try and hide it, but I can't
Why do I act like I'm all high and mighty, when inside I'm dyin'?
I am finally realizin' I need help, can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks I've been havin' ups and downs
Goin' through peaks and valleys
Dilly-dallyin' 'round with the idea of endin' this shit right here
I'm hatin' my reflection
I walk around the house tryna fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah
I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear is Hailie
I'm afraid if I close my eyes then I might see her... shit

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah, Dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall, what happened that you can't stop with these pills?
And you've fallen off with your skills
And your own fans are laughin' at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle?
Get up, be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at nobody, he'd fight first
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm poppin' Vics, Percs and Methadone pills
"Yeah, Em, tight verse, you killed it!"
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gon' do whatever I says when I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then—

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne & Eminem]
I'm going through changes
(Don’t know what I’m gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes)
I'm going through changes

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My friends can't understand this new me
That's understandable, man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too
If you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you
What you want me to do? I'm startin' to live like a recluse
And the truth is, fame's startin' to give me an excuse
To be at an all-time low; I sit alone in my home theater
Watchin' the same damn DVD of the
First tour; the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurts so I fast forward, sleeping pills'll make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I'll just take a couple more, yeah, you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie, come on, dole 'em out!
"Daddy, don't you die on me! Daddy, better hold your ground!"
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice?
Yeah, baby, hold me down

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne & Eminem]
I'm going through changes
(Don’t know what I’m gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes)
I'm going through changes

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes
But somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit, it just hit me that what if I would not've made it through?
I think about the things I woulda never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day
We just could never get it together, hey
Wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain
When it rains, guess it pours — yes, it does
Wish there wasn't any pain, but I can't pretend there ain't
I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers, Heaven knows I've never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today I looked at your picture, almost if to say
I miss you subconsciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away
Don't know why, I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm—

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne & Eminem]
I'm going through changes
(Don’t know what I’m gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes)
I'm going through changes
