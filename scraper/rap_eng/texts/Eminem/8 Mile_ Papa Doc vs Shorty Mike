[Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie)]
Your lyrics are shitty like when I cop a squat
Who told ya you can fuck with the mighty Papa Doc
For steppin' on the stage I should've rocked ya knot
And don't get too close or ya might get shot
You need to call ya momma and tell her to come get ya
And if she knew him she could bring her midget pops with her
I put a hole on your head like a 12 gauge
Lookin' like Kris Kross jiggity jumped your ass on stage
'Cause I'm a grown man son, I'll slaughter you
Make yo mom wish that her fat ass aborted you
