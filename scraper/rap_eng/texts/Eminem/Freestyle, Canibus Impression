[Sound effect: gunshot]

[EMINEM]

I’m a kick it
The motherfuckin’ liquid
That I be spittin’
Infinite ammunition
Yeah you wishin’
You try to step to this but you died
You tried to fuck with my style but get denied
And get hit
And get pushed back to the fuckin lab
When I stab you in the abdomen
When I grab a pen and jab it in

[EMINEM begins CANIBUS impression]

Travelin like an abdomen and gag you with it
Javelin when I’m stabbing it and grabbin it
With the Canibus animal animus
Element jam it is
Whatever lattice magnanimous
And the shadow is adamant
The equilibrium will lay on top of these mathematics
