[Intro]
Yeah, Blocc Boy on the beat
It's Cashis, spend some real shit
It's for my, it's for my seeds, nigga
It's still Shady though

[Verse 1]
Sit back right, all night spot post
Do the same thang, killing off black folks
Selling on the side, string save a mean more
To anything I own, watch crack being smoke
Got the picture of the seven little reasons
That keep, any nigga disrespecting me breathing
Still I be high, every time I see them
My babies, my angels and they are my freedom
I know I'm on the grind, lately I ain't coming home
They keep you in my life, I never leave your mom alone
You know I'm whyling out, straying strapped, ride or dying
You hear the stories 'bout your daddy floating 'round town?
But you call me up like, "Daddy I been finding out
That you caught Rico slipping, beat him up and stomped him out"
So when you go to school, you wanna do it too?
You just like me, how can I be mad at you?

[Hook]
You ain't had to live like I did and still you are just like me
Hell I even did a bid and came back to see you are just like me
The only reason I ain't kill myself is for fear you'll be just like be
You got the demons that's within myself, now I see, you are just like me

[Verse 2]
Standin on the block, tryna make my money clock
Servin situations, my nuts about a cock
I wanna stop but, y'all gotta have a lot
Even if it means sacrificing the life of your pops
I'm the breadwinner, I don't fear nann nigga
I don't trust nobody, I'm a man
Liquor, running through my veins, you running through my brain
I start to see your heart, we feel each other's pain
I talk to all of y'all when I say I love you mayne
One day we'll ball and I'll never have to leave again
Until that day comes, shorty be a G
I ride with y'all everywhere cause y'all are part of me
Here go my hugs and kisses, never give you up for bitches
Promise to give you riches, all of my little niggas
Here go my hugs and kisses, never give you up for bitches
Promise to give you riches, all of my little niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Look how they talking shit, twice a year I drop a key
I bet nobody ever love 'em like they daddy did
I teach 'em young, don't be rolling on no scary shit
Long as you love each other, you'll be very rich
Everybody question how I be affording this
I make my money off of dicks and spend it on my kids
I'm sending messages in bottles of imagination
So they can feel my presence, though they at home just waiting
My soldiers still in training, throwing up forks like they banging
Know how to bogart, and never trust a stranger
They the ones I look to whenever I'm in danger
We walking holding hands, interlocking trigger fingers
This is my record to my kids, I'm a banger
And a father so my conversation must remain gangsta
This is my record to my kids, I'm a banger
And a father so my conversation must remain gangsta

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, it don't get much realer than that, Shady, Cashis, nigga
Be a man, take care of yours that don't make you no less gangsta
My nigga not take care of his, I take care of mine homie
I'mma give a individual shoutout to 'em, Miana, Jasmine, Ramani
Rashanti, Lil' Mone and Rah Monique, Tavian, they are just like me
