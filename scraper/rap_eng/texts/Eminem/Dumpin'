[Intro: Eminem]
Ayo, yo, this is motherfuckin' Eminem
Dirty Dozen, 'bout to show you
How we set it when we come through
Know what I'm sayin'?
Word up, bitch-motherfuckers better raise up
Y'all motherfuckers better raise up!
Ayo, buss it! Ayo…

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm a pit bull terrier, triple darin' ya
Scarin' ya with a derringer
Ready to make you wet like a submariner
Tearin' ya frame out with homicidal lines
Bringin' the drama and the trauma to your mama's vital signs (Blaow!) A verbal shot fired, this mic's been hot wired
Uppercuts to your chin, knockin' your snot skyward
Rappers wanna be screenplay actors
So I'm givin' they spine fractures
Like linebackers from the Green Bay Packers
And roll over 'em backwards, Dirty Dozen
I'm someone you just don't wanna see, like a nerdy cousin
So keep your distance when I get this tense
You see my fist clench? It's gonna be some bullets dispensed
You best to keep your premises fenced
You missed hints, any resistance
Get you voided like misprints
You'll end up with no teeth left makin' a beef threat
When I roll up on your set
Don't get it twisted like Keith Sweat

[Hook 1: Eminem]
When I get to bustin', you best to get to jumpin'
I'm touchin' somethin'
Fool, I'm comin' through dumpin'
My beat's bumpin', you hear it thumpin'?
That oughta tell you somethin'
Bitch, I'm comin' through dumpin'
Bullets hit you, your heart stops pumpin'
Your blood starts clumpin'
I'm comin' through dumpin'
If you don't know, you best make an assumption
I got you slumpin'
Fool, I'm comin' through dumpin'

[Verse 2: Proof]
A proven fact, my pact got your whole team movin' back
We never losin' slack, I paid dues in rap
I'm runnin' till my shoes are tapped
My writers use them gats, my thugs fuse them cracks
Relax and catch a contact to an amusin' track
Slugs dispatched on any street riz and mismatch
My team'll get busy, like rednecks on some six packs
My fist crack the featherweight, my words'll never break
A clever snake'll be forever fake
Let me get this cheddar straight
Makin' dough is a part, so is the heart, my flow is the art
Me and the mic Gomez like Lois & Clark
Weapons concealed until death, now see 'em
My chrome shatter bones that lack calcium
Knockin' domes out the ballpark
Your dawgs is all bark, plus you got a small heart
Now save them corny lines for Hallmark
I want the sunny days and money paid in them figures
A microphone fiend
And on my own team there's fake niggas
Mums they rocked the cradle, I spot the fable
They made the shop and stable, with grass top the table
The Glock enable when I pop the fatal
Phonies that I plot prenatal wax
The player haters never make it back; I'm dumpin'

[Hook 1: Eminem]
When I get to bustin', you best to get to jumpin'
I'm touchin' somethin'
Fool, I'm comin' through dumpin'
My beat's bumpin', you hear it thumpin'?
That oughta tell you somethin'
Bitch, I'm comin' through dumpin'
Bullets hit you, your heart stops pumpin'
Your blood starts clumpin'
I'm comin' through dumpin'
If you don't know, you best make an assumption
I got you slumpin'
Fool, I'm comin' through dumpin'

[Verse 3: B-Flat]
Ayo, we don't say fat, we stay [scrow?] business
The third nigga on the mic, representin' [roughanopolous?]
Ain't shit stoppin' us, old school like Cold Crush
Slice and dice MC's on the mic like cold cuts
Live and direct, comin' straight from the ghet'
Where niggas keep it real and make these girls' panties wet
I can't forget the DJ, he play, we say
Funky type of shit that make the crowd wanna flip
We don't bust clips, guns is not in us
But when shit get deep it's a must that we bust
Arm, leg, leg, arm and head
Or afros and facing bald heads all way down to the dreads
40s to drink, endos we smoke
And the rims that we ride on are true, deez spokes
Tires, know a lot of Michaels, but they don't live on Myers
Bitch's pussy tight, here come the dick pliers
What's my name? Call me sire
[Real wide?] on the mic, like titty dancers on the fire
When you hear my beat, [?] live crowds jumpin'
I’m comin' through dumpin’

[Hook 2: B-Flat]
Other MC's like Doug E. Fresh ain’t sayin' nuttin’
Bitch-nigga, I'm comin' through dumpin'
Go to the church, I’ll have the dick in cold humpin'
Word up, ‘cause my shit be comin' through dumpin'

[Verse 4: Eye-Kyu]
When I'm lifted, don't quiz this, it ain't worth it to risk it
I quick with the gift, and twice as swift with the biscuit
Headed back to ship off
All these niggas' ass around Christmas
They know it's the time of year, they be expectin' my visits
Doin' 90 on the henzel, runnin' to get it
And twist you niggas like a pretzel
Blows come in three, like the Godfather trilogy
I'm Micheal Corleone with this mic
Bitch, you ain't killin' me
Let me see some hands to make sure y'all feelin' me
I'm stickin' you up for your rocks
And y'all gon' give 'em up willingly
Rap is my life, and that's why every day I live it
Punches holes in the floor, like wack rappers records
Man, ain't a nigga in here is bringin' in drama this thick
Then they time to come up shorter
Than bloods on a midgits, shit, can you dig it?!

[Hook 3: Eye Kyu]
Kyu comin' through with somethin'
Guarenteed to make your whole fuckin' block jumpin'
Comin through dumpin'
When we come, we got your knees cumblin'
Y'all niggas ain't sayin nothin', ‘cause we comin' dumpin'
What you talkin'? Nigga, get to walkin'
See your bitch-ass crew stalkin', but we gon get to dumpin'
You don't want it, while headin' back up off it
I'ma tell you how it is, nigga, ‘cause we dumpin'
