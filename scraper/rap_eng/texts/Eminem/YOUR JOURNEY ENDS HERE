Yeah ayy so apparently if I don’t rap to the beat that makes me lame ayy face it QueenSilver you don’t know a thing ayy you're some 70 year old loser what a damn shame ayy you ain’t ever gonna get no fame ayy I’m sorry but your just to lame ayy after I’m done your rhymes are really gonna drain ayy cause after I’m done you gonna feel some real pain yeah ayy
Fine I’ll go with the beat here you go yo la la la di da da da you're like If Kelly Benzino and Ja Rule's aftermath mixed together your such a idiotic touchy little feather  and your son's gonna have to live with that forever so who you gonna diss next the Rap God or flip it around Snoop Dogg next up your gonna be making a blog with a ton of lies cause that’s all your filled with, Beast brought this to my attention I don’t want to start a convention you want me to be done fine but first let me go down the line you destroyed Energy Infusion for me it was so cringey I was expecting at least one ree now after I’m done your life won’t be wow no more In this story the Wendigo does win cause this mistake was actually a sin you won’t be skinning me can’t you see your life will remain a Wasteland after I’m done your a disgrace to your son I love how you act like you're in a gang yet all you do is that auto tuned sang Light Sea really your using the same crappy generic flow yo the only reason Swim With The Lights was good was cause Beast was on it so flour it so don’t even think about dissing back cause if so I’ll immediately destroy that track cause I’m just going easy on you so after this don’t even try to be all nice like waddup cause I’ll respond with a sit down and shut up and now fear cause your journey ends right here
