It’s not about lyrics anymore, it’s about a hot beat and a catchy hook

[Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it
Then so be it
Cause nowadays these kids, jeez
Don’t give a shit bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and thats it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ’s playing them hits
Oh this my jam, this my shit
We dont know a word to a verse
All we know is the chorus
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the songs ginormous, the whole formula’s switched
Cause we don’t know anymore, what are hits
Is it the beat, is it the rap
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When 13 year olds control the remote
And Ashley’s got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-phasis on our syllables

[Jay-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc isn’t the beat
Than I’m gon feature EM and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Rove
Cause everywhere I go they love the bling bling flow
Bang bang look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing’ cost ya man lot of dough, oh
The fuck am I busting my brain for?
Its just the way the game go, oh, it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow
You bought the shit
I guess you to blame too
I just found the angle
No more reality flow
I’m tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the Mac 11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist tell her “we in press heaven”
No one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the internet
So you want the chat room or the house of Malibu Em?
Your emphasis is on the wrong Syllable

[Dr Dre]
They said 30′s the new 20
Funny, must mean 40′s the new 30
Interesting cause ever since then it’s been in a sense
An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now
Its all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it’s his last and 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops what we got then
So now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do
Gambling everytime we put a record out
Just looking for that hook

[Eminem]
(Wait Dre look)
Shorty I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be cause shorty
You love me
And I love you too
And I promise I’ll be true to you

[50 Cent]
Go shorty, its your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
Its the kid that flip flows who used to flip O’s
And run G for days used to see how I get hoes
I’m international, I get my dick licked round the globe
I’m sick right into show, riding on lolo’s
Puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolo’s
Don’t fuck with the dodo’s, I sling for dumb hoes
I playing, I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked
Look, its not a game, me B, I ain't playing
Beep behind me player, so you here anyway
You don’t hear what I’m saying
Me fin-nini-na
Fee-fi-dididee-yay
Just give me my check and I’ll be on my way
Sunny bunny money and funny
You ain't even listening and I just took your money

[GR Lynch]
This ain't top 40 or hit list shit
Not for TRL, no Rick Dees' picks
This is straight GRL ski mix bitch
Call me Strasburg when I pitch this shit
I leave these other rappers so tongue-tied
They just local, GR's worldwide
You sound like cabbage, ya wilted outside
I spit tomatoes straight from the vine
Leave these other artists lookin all sundried
A bunch of little stains, to them I'm Tide
Keep a stain stick in my Subaru ride
Glass all black can't see us igniting
Paint white out like you fucked up writing
Mount baker bout to get a boost in style
In the parking lot they can't help but smile
Ma'am please cover the eyes of your child
Gunz come out you know bumpin 50
Subie 2 shes covered with bitties
Snowpants blue like the sign for thrifty
So baggy what are those a fuckin size 60?
Burrito legs bitch, call me big shitty
