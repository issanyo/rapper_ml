Wow, it's been a few months since we've profiled a creme-de-la-creme MC in need of some nurturing from a record company. During our ninety day hiatus, however, our ever-reliable "Flavortracker 2000" came across a target that, in many ways, redefines the term ill. He goes by the name of Eminem (as in the popular candy). After making a buzz in the Detroit area for quite some time, he just recently gained the hip-hop nation's attention with his impressive showing in events like the Rap Olympics. One glimpse of the contents within his Slim Shady demo, one can't help but recognize that this rapper of the Caucasian persuasion's got skills.

     As far as flow, he keeps it simple, yet extremely effective. In "Murder, Murder," he kicks a humorous tale about a bank heist gone wrong: "Left the keys in the van/ With a gat in each hand/ Went up in Eastland/ Shot a policeman/ Fuck a peace plan/ If citizen bystands/ The shit is my hands/ Here's your life span/ For what your life's worth, this money is twice than/ Grab a couple grand and live in Iceland/ See, I'm a nice man, but money turned me to Satan." Another guaranteed rewinder is the semi-demented "Just The Two Of Us," a crazy tale about the actions Eminem takes upon his baby's mother. With wifey placed comfortably in the back of his trunk, Em drives far and wide explaining to his seed the reasons why "daddy had to bury mommy."

     Point blank, this ain't your average cat. This Motor City kid is a one-of-a-kind talent and he's about to blow past the competition, leaving many melted microphones in the dust.
