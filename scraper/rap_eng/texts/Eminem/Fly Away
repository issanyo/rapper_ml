[Hook: Just Blaze]
Some people ask me, where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody can save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted or try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, they say I'm crazy
They ask what me I think and I say maybe I'll fly away
And ain't nothing in the way so I may as well fly away
There ain't nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon' die today
'Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go
And the only way to see me's if you looking up from down below
And there's nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
And there's nothing in my way so I may as well fly away
I'm on top of this thing so I may as well fly away

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
I'ma step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hanging offa my butt
And you ain't 'bout to tell me nothing boy, get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money, two for the show
My shit don't stink, I don't think so
Wipe my ass with the tissue and roll it back up in the roll
Are you ready now, here we go, the bald eagle has landed
I'm back in your hair, sorry for leaving you stranded
I'm twice as dreaded, evil and rancid
They can't sit, I don't think anybody understands it
Especially when the world's silly putty in your hands
It's Play-Doh, I ain't back to play, though
They say he died in a fatal car crash, shows what they know
Shit if I did, it'd be a trailer not a car
The white trash star, I fuck an RV-up like Brett Favre
Homie you got it backwards, you're dipping your soup
Inside your crackers, I can carry rap till my back hurts
Set it down, go right back to the chiropractors
Get my back right then I'm right back on you bastards
I was chasing the dragon, I don't know what happened
It's like the feeling I had when I first started rappin'
I just couldn't seem to get back and recapture that magic
So I went back to the lab, that's where I been at, when

I took a hiatus, haters now I'm back to cause trouble
Got the fucking shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles
I'm the *Explosion*, you ain't fucking sick, the hospital
Won't even give you cough drops for coughs cocksucker
You think you hot? You ain't even lukewarm
My puke's hotter than you, you're soft
I use fire to cool me off
I told them I would grow up one day and show them
I'd be able to choke clouds
Pick up lightning bolts and throw them
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgi-porgi kissed the girls, make the girls cry for it
Make 'em swarm, make 'em fight over the shirts I've worn
Swoon over my sweat towels, it's mind blowing
Yes I'm living the dream homie, can't nothing compare
I’m so up, I’m stuck in mid air, I’m loving it yeah
It's like these people are steps now, all they do is stare
These haters are so pussy they afraid to be scared
This is pay back, like I owe 'em back pay
They spat in my face now I'm back to do them the same exact way
And leave this rap game with a bad taste
And slap it back out before I step back outta this crap, they
Slap me now I'm slapping them back hey, fuck it
We're slap happy, yeah okay, now I'm talking some smack, aye
And I ain't looking back, in fact, they can stare at my ass crack
How's that for hind sight, what the track say?
