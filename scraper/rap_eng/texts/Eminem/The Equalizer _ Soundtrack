Eminem riddled everyone by posting the squared picture of "The Equalizer" on Instagram - the movie with his favorite actor, Denzel Washington.

Just a day later, trailer has arrived.

It features Sia's singing and Eminem, most likely, singing a bridge to song. This snippet would be from their second collabo, with "Beautiful Pain" being first.

Eminem is most likely to do a full soundtrack, maybe even a music video for this song and/or make a cameo.

Stay tuned for more info on the song. As for the movie, it's coming 26th September.
