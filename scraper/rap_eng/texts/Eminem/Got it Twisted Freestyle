[Verse: Eminem]
I done figured this rap shit out, I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything and it seems to be the key
To my success I've murked for me-uh... (slurs words) repeatedly
(Laughter and slurs words) to beat MCs
Timing is everything and it seems to be the key
Let 'em diss you first and respond immediately
In order to master the art of war, don't start a war
Shit not no more, we done scared 'em off, there are no more
Victims to sic, I'm fixin' to pick some and start shit
Ain't got no pictures to rip and shit to throw darts in
Ain't got no more targets, shit Irv and Jeff
We done beat 'em to death, Benzino in debt
It seems to just be no one left to bully, Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush? Puss is bushy
Ain't shit going on, shit I been gettin' so bored lately
I'm thinkin' of doing some shit to get you to go and hate me again
Tell the truth I like the shit better then
Shit I can spit better, I'm bout to kick that shi-shit again
Look, the game just ain't the same, it's changin'
Shit Dre's quittin', Jay's quittin', now it's just wanksta
Sayin' the same shit, it's fake and it's ancient
It's makin' me so bored I'ma just make a new language
Fubba you cubba cubba, ubbu you ubbu ooba
Yooba can subba my dibidick through a tubba
Suma newma lama, I'm not a human
I'm a suicidal super sonic suicidal uni-bomber
You think I'm the new Osama, press think I'm the new Madonna
Jeffrey Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on, uh
Lotta talk and rumors on us, who's the hottest? To be honest
Hip-hop ain't been the same since 2Pac moved to Cuba on us
