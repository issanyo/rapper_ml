[Verse]
Come here spittin' with non written
Non fiction
Rappers try to step to this with no prediction
It doesn't matter cause I'm smashing and bashing and crashing
I hate rappers with a passion when I'm chilling with DJ Fashion
Yo, I need a frickin' Kleenex or I die like River Phoenix
When I'm chilling with Phoenix
With two Coronas I'm on the microphone and I'mma own this
Yo and I'mma bone this
In Arizona
Yo, rappers that ain't able
That can't stay stable
I'm on two turntables
With my man
But he doesn't matter cause he kicks lyrics galore
And he's only 5'4"
Yo check it out, I bust rhymes and get groovy
My man got carded at a rated R movie
But it really didn't matter he wasn't insulted
He said "I'm 27 years old. Yo, I'm an adult kid."
But yo, still
Slim Shady gets ill with the skill
And I'mma always gonna build and kill
My baby's mama just to piss the world off
Just to piss the girl's off
Yo, I hurl off
The top of the building
Kill women and children
And then it hit me
Suddenly my wrist's tried to slit me
Couldn't believe it
Yo, y'all couldn't conceive it
It's Slim Shady
I'll fuck a girl in her cleavage
Bleep that out and you can keep it
Just bleep it
Yo, y'all keep it a secret
I'm top secret
Like Pop Secret
Rappers, they don't wanna see
Slim Shady, I'm from the motherfuckin' D
