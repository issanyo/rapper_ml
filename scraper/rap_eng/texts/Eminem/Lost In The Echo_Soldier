[Verse 1: Eminem]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just want to see if it's true
If it's you, what you say in your rap's what you do
So they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
In confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it. If you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
Pull it, squeeze it till it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

[Chorus: Linkin Park]
In these promises broken deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go... Go... Go...

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I love pissin' you off, it gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfucking bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol whippin' motherfucking bouncers, 6'2"
Who needs bullets? Soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better, 'cause instead you murderin'
You can hurt 'em, and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
Running and ducking out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether its your fault or not

[Chorus: Linkin Park]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I spit it slow, so these kids know that I'm talking to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics, and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of 'Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock
Listen to the sound of me spilling my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
Till the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity

[Chorus: Linkin Park]
