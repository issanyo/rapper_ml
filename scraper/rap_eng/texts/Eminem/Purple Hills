[Hook: Eminem]
I've been so many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'?
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple hills

[Verse 1: Eminem]
(Yo, yo, yo)
Cool calm, just like my mom
With a couple of lawsuits inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
Roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit
(Aww shit) I started a mosh pit
Squashed a chick and lost the foster kids
This room makes me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin' weight
'til I see dumb (shit) start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryna rap again!
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce!
I said come on bounce!
Everybody in the house doing mass amounts
To the women in the thongs with their asses out
We don't bull (shit) better ask around
D-12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre your mom is (passing out)
Help me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out!

[Verse 2: Kuniva and Kon Artis]
[Kuniva]
Junk that someone help Denaun
He's upstairs wrestling with Elton John!
[Kon Artist]
Hey Von, ya see me stepping on these leprechauns?
[Kuniva]
They gotta be Tums, the Ex-Lax is gone
[Kon Artist]
Yeah I took 'em all dawg with some Parmesan
And I think my arm is gone
[Kuniva]
Naw it's probably numb
Young, dumb and full of (cum)
(BLEEEEHH) And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue!
[Kon artist]
Scaredy ass it was a false alarm!
Ya think I 'bout to die when I just got on?
[Kuniva]
Yo, stop acting stupid
You so (high) that you might wake up with a (guy) on some new (shit)(EWWW)
[Kon artist]
Yeah I think I did too much, (uh huh)
I think I got the runs! (uh huh)
[(Red pills, blue pills, and green)]
Watch out, here it comes!

[Bridge]
Dirty dozen, 80 of us
Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probly' wanna take each other out and date each other
Somethin', Somethin', Somethin', Somethin', Somethin', Somethin', Somethin'
I don't know

[Verse 3: Proof]
Hop, hills, hills I hop
Hop two hills on stilts I walk
(Snort two lines) that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible I (killed) the hulk
I wanna (roll) away like a roller blade
Until my (eyes roll) back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and grey I'm 'a go for broke
No? Okey doke, (I'm packing my nose) with soap
*coughing* Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Aww, poor baby, born by (whore) lady
Now I'm paying child support? (It's your baby!)

[Verse 4 - Swifty]
I take (four shots) at one time!
And I don't need a chase when I'm swallowing mine
(Hey, ya got any room?) in Bizarre's hatch back
We can't go far cause the car has flats
Why the hell you people think I rap?
Cause my mother taught me how to breach contracts
And if you got cash, then hide it too (Swift chill!)
I'm just trynna get by like you!
Well I don't give a damn if you find me rude
Mean crude to hell with you too
I only need three (pills) and I'm cool
I just got some, and I'm going back soon

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Bizarre]
I'm at a rave looking at a babe like she want it
Gin and Tonic demonic, body smell like vomit
Looney, crazy, jumpy, sexy, dopey headed guy
Whipped cream, dirty mattresses, wanna try?
(Blue pills, golden seals)
Got Bizarre acting ill
Drugs kill (Yeah right)
Chick I'm for real!
Shut your mouth you dirty girl
You know you want me in your world
Ladies, please don't fight
Bizarre's here all night!
