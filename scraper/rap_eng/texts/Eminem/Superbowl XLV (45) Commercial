[Narrator]
I gotta question for ya. What does this city know about luxury huh?
What does a town that's been to hell and back know about the finer things in life?
Well I'll tell ya. More than most.
You see its the hottest fires that make the hardest steel.
Add hard work and conviction,
And the know how that runs generations deep in every one of us.
That's who we are. That's our story.
Now it's probably not the one you've been reading in the papers
The one being written by folks who've never even been here and
Don't know what we're capable of.
Because when it comes to luxury
It's as much about where its from as who its for.
Now we're from America.
But this isn't New York City.
Or the Windy City.
Or Sin City.
And we're certainly no one's Emerald City.
