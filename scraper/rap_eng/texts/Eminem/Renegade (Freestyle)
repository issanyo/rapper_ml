It's Young Money
Euro, look


[Verse]
I hear the shots bein fired
My enemies wired
Keep pushin' me to execute the same folks I inspired, like why?
Tire yourself out to be hopeless and tied
Anyone over me is simply roastin over the fire
I'm over desired flow, Fijis spit feces, it's my time
Don't gotta watch to see me, believe me, can't take it easy
'Til my house in Providence looks like the one in Washington, DC
No need to campaign, expect change
Imma do my damn thing, think otherwise you damn wrong
Trynna balls out when motherfuckers tell you to keep your pants on
I hear the softest rappers throwing temper tantrums
And these hardcore rappers singing camp songs
Something ain't right, ain't nothing alike, we nothing alike
I keep my distance, they squinting to see something in sight
Take a step closer for some to say
"I hope you know that no weapon will ever be stronger than what I spit on the mic"
I understand, I might be out of my line
Getting on a beat that's out of my time, I'm out of my mind
But fuck it, I'm over average, I no longer feel a challenge
When people would rather listen to who's trending than who has talent
Blame the environment, it's never silent
Couldn't dream, every attempt to sleep disturbed by sirens
Such a violent harmony plays when you strum my vocal cords on a violin
I am in no position of quitting on living the life I was given
Driven and became distant from those who witnessed
I kept working, they kept wishing, that's the difference
Threatened by my spitting so they spit on my image
I'm a spitting image of linen, wait a minute
Didn't you say I couldn't and wouldn't do?
But I did it, couldn't fit in so I told 'em good riddance
Y'all forgotten, not forgiven
I wouldn't have hurt your feelings if y'all wasn't that similar to women
I go nowhere unless it's too far
I'm not good enough until I'm better than you are, whoever you are
That's if you are the real ya
It's easy to die if life is hard enough to kill ya
First time for everything, I'm everything's first time
First and last word in every verse mine
But first off, know my first words were said in Spanish
So how I manage to be this good with words and English is my second language?

[Hook]
I'm a renegade
Never been afraid to say what's on my mind at any given time of day
Cause I'm a renegade
Never been afraid to holler about anything
Anything, anything, anything
