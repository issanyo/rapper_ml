I wished you went
To Hell 'cause you need to
Wakin' up at 5AM
To think about you
And I say "Burn in Hell!"
Yeah, no Heaven for you
'Cause I'm the god
So you can't doubt me

Stay away from me
Or burn in Hell
I'm tellin' ya, I'm dead serious
You need fall down a void
Fallin' forever until
You starve to death

You can't control it
'Cause I'm the god
And you the mortal
I'm tellin' ya to burn in Hell
So do it, you mortal fool!

You can't doubt me
'Cause I'm the god
And you the mortal
I'm tellin' ya to do what I demand
So do it, you fool!

I choose to burn you in Hell
For all eternity even
If you're dead
Its your punishment
And you will listen to me!
(No, please, no)

Yeah yeah yeah
Go to Hell
Burn in Hell
I'M THE GOD OF MORTALS
Think you can stop me?
Oh well, you're the one
Who challenged me

You can't control it
'Cause I'm the god
And you the mortal
I'm tellin' ya to burn in Hell
So do it, you mortal fool!

You can't doubt me
'Cause I'm the god
And you the mortal
I'm tellin' ya to do what I demand
So do it, you fool!

We gods are strong immortals
And yeah you can't defeat us
I'm like Zeus, 'cause he's undefeatable
Burn in Hell, Burn in Hell
You gotta do what I demand
Or you'll be dead instantly

Burn in Hell
Burn in Hell
Burn in Hell
Burn in Hell

Go, go, go
Go to Hell
Dude yeah! (Dude no!)

Now your time is up
Say goodbye to your friends
You're leavin' your life behind
You're now my soul slave
Now you'll do what I
Demand for all eternity!

My lifelong friend
There's no way back
'Cause you can't escape me
Now you'll stay with me forever
I will treat you well like a child
'Cause There's no way a god
Can abuse their people

Goodbye
