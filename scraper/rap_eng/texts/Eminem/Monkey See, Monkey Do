[Intro]
Ayo 50
What I tell you?
We ain't even have to say shit, they did it, ha ha

[Chorus]
Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let them come to you, the rest'll just follow suit, monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come as we expected, now we just set 'em up
Check-mate, motherfucker, games over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

[Verse]
Doesn't take much for me to raise such a stink up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You ain't even got to say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
S'like smearing a bloodstain with a paint brush
I can’t explain what it is my brain does
But however it works it's insane, it's plain nuts
And it ain't just my brain that’s dangerous
It’s a whole combination of things, it takes nuts
And I’m not afraid to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the bank and 8 trucks
For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
I'm patiently waiting for the day, I’m anxious
To see the look on ya fake mugs
When you thugs go bankrupt
Ya drunk, you ain't tough
Whatever you drank must of just turned you into some gangstas
This is me talking, motherfucker, this ain’t drugs
You wanna pop shit? Wake up then make up
FUCK THAT! It’s too late chump, now face up
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the caliber that Nas and Jay does
Opens up his jaw to say somethin' or rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
So I can blow the fucking dust off of this chainsaw
And give him the surgery that he came for
'Til I pull the paint off
I never been shot
But I think me and Fifty must of been cut from the same cloth
'Cause I’ve always came off like Ja's chain
When they try to rush him and lost
And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
I don’t stop, only thing that I wait for
Is the day that I ain't gotta report to probate court
'Cause I'ma give y'all a reason to hate more
'Cause I been holding my tongue 'til I got a sprained jaw
A lot of rappers on my list that just ain’t Ja
And I'ma read that motherfucker off come April
You pussies think I went soft 'cause 8 Mile
When I come back I’ll be shooting more than just paintballs
Trust me

[Chorus]
Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let them come to you, the rest'll just follow suit, monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come as we expected, now we just set 'em up
Check-mate, motherfucker, games over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

[Outro]
Fucking dummies
This ain’t chess
You playin' motherfucking checkers
This shit is all day man it’s too easy
We playing chess you playing checkers
You 'bout to get your mother fucking asses jumped
Fucking punks
And by the way
We ain’t just talking to one person
We talking to every-motherfucking-body who wants to bring it
'Cause we bring it into anybody who wants to bring it
So bring it
Don’t pick up the ball if you don’t wanna play man
It’s all fucked up now
Fuck I’m suppose to do now?
Huh?!
What the fuck I'm suppose to do?!
Yo, we out!
