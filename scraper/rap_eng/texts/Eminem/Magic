[Hook: French Montana]
Watch me make what I lost
I ain't gotta choice it is what it be
Watch me make magic
I pull that pigeon out the hat
Pull that 50 out the bag
Gunning, niggas out here dumbing
It ain't where you from, it's where ya at

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Got an axe in the bag, couple of fags
Stuffed in the backseat muzzled and gagged
Wrapped in bubble wrap 2 lesbians a couple hustler mags
Now grab the pez dispenser
Fill it up to the max with muscle relaxers
The governor of Alaska
She lusts when I ask her
To shove my pulaski sausage up in her ass huh
While we hover over Nebraska
Shooting at the fucking Buffalo pastures
In the helicopter man I can't fuck her no faster
She's screaming grab my titties shady suck on those bastards
But I ain't no sucker
I won't snuggle up with her after
I'm a Gigolo, bitch I look like the Juggalo rapper?
Everyday man I just seem to get a little bit doper
But shit back down, man I'd rather lick on the scrotum
And eat the fuckin' octo mom pussy lips with some okra
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg scissor with Oprah
While Rosie pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa
Get the boner and play dick swords with the Jonas Brothers
Your motherfucking mothers aromas
Like no other I keep thinking of her smothered in soma's...

[Hook: French Montana]

[Verse 2:French Montana]
I'mma take em to the top
They ain't fucking with the top deal
Top player im the new Dre, Snoop, Pac
Big chain ice hot
His slang white block
Bread pumping like speakers
Flow Ether like Nasir
You can bulletproof ya truck and get shot still
Shots peel, 40 turn your brains into oxtail
Pop pills, shawty pussy right but her top real
She took the condom off and jerked me off like the lox's deal
All I bump is Jada and Max
Bent with the cramium cracked
Smoother like that henny and black
I be the mac with the 2 slugs, ski mask
Two gloves ask about them boys tall like manute was
