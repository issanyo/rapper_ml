[Intro]

Take the shades off, they gotta see me for this one
Throw the hoodie on, they gotta feel me for this one
Don...
Corner Stories coming soon, you dig?

[Verse]

I'm sitting court-side with niggas that bought pies
Talking boss vibes, they hustled and thought wise
Had a lot of friends, now it's like a short nine
'Cause either they all died, in jail or crossed sides
Look, it's non-fiction whenever the Don spittin'
It's palms itchin', never knew his father, heart missin'
In the middle of the night, and he caught his mom sniffin'
Hard livin', bet you never see them scars healin'
We just praying on a good hand while the cards dealin'
Really feelin' like we ain't start winnin' till we start sinnin'
Half of the time, it's murder on the back of my mind
Packagin' dimes, young nigga just adaptin' to crime
Never got a hand out, I ain't ask for a dime
These are stories out my life, they just happen to rhyme
And I'm destined for greatness, I expect them to hate this
Trust me, your grind is never respected till you make it
Liquor gettin' spilled for the niggas that was killed
You can't see my eyes 'cause my hoodie on tilt
We ain't getting no sleep til the mission complete
We just tryna see a million a week
All praises to the Lord Saviour
I made a come up off them old razors
Chasin' short paper on a corner til the force take us
Bunch of law breakers, small hood, we was all neighbors
And all the ball players turn to .44 sprayers
Different kind of thrill when you pay your momma bills
Fans, got a record label, nigga signing deals
Them OGs had candy canes and candy rain
Movin' pictures, it's new edition, can you stand the rain?
This ain't a game, this a family thing, I manage pain
Wonder when the damage came, certain shit I can't explain
Friends killin' friends and they lit up a ten
Over bitches and ends, tell me when will it end
And I live through it, niggas tellin', I seen the real do it
Momma told me "don't stand on that corner", and I still do it
Since boot rooms, the kid been locked in like a group home
Dropped out of class, made a killin' on the school zone

[Outro]

Yeah...
We ain't playin' no games, they know what the fuck it is
