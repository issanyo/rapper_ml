X is Shady, the next to pave streets
For rappers comin through, dont act and run into
The Mac in front of you, I use it to do Jobs
No Steve, but im bitin your apple, none of you
Can touch the kid's skill, ridin through the city on big wheels, his sick skill can
Stick these twigs through the lids of your chick's view
Use that as a reasonable excuse
To feasibly kick you outta the galaxy
Radically, I manically stab at thee like a crusader
Havin thee best time of my life
Grotesque rhymes in the night
Your chest hugging my knife, I'm cuttin ya belt
Disembowel you and forcefeed you your guts, you're full of yourself
Quick to brag, I grip the Mag, it spit til it click
It's sick as Mad
Cow disease, and the brownest fleas
Straight off the back of rat, the Plague gon attack and that's that
The rumour is me and Rihanna be renting a room
The truth is tryna repent, since i zoomed out the womb
Slapped the midwife and spewed all over the room
You don't understand that i been crazy since an embryo
Physical gettin mangled, Im bendin yo neck back til you kissin your frickin anal
I guess now you can watch yo back
No need to pay a bodyguard, still wishin you was not so wack
I am the pinnacle, cynical and a boss
A minute is all i need to revisit the frickin loft
To get to finishing off the shiverin whimpering children
Im sorry, im kiddin but im sicker than picking off
A zit the width of a yacht on the centre spot on my philtrum
That's awful just to think bout, that image is finna bother
My intelligent mind for ten mins at a time
When kickin a rhyme, I climb to other levels
That none of yall been to before, I'm a pioneer
You finna fall into the floor, go and buy a beer
And a copy of my album, you sloppy as wide assholes
Coppin squats inside flower pots
The size of a fine marker
What I release sticks to you but i ain't Peter Parker
Im a bit of a psycho, so im finna eat ya partner
Leave a lit carpet bomb in the bin of each apartment
I visit in the evenin, it's been a real nice time
Spittin the sickest and wickedest lyrics, I've had it
Im madder now so gather round, I'm eatin up this lad I found
The way this boss holds TECs is crazy, he'll check your baby, wreck you, X is Shady
