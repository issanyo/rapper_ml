[Intro: Proof]
Yeeaah! This is DJ Seven Deuce, live at
Club Runyan, where all the girls with burgundy hair get in free
G-Unit in the house! What up baby
Performing live tonight live on stage... Captain Save-A-Ho
And the fabulous Case y'all, stick 'em out y'all
All my Detroit players, let's go!

[Hook: Kon Artis]
I ain't set the stroke and I ain't for games
I just came to fuck and maybe get some brain
I got a woman at the crib so I ain't your man
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned
You know all I really wanna do is fuck
I ain't gon' let a money hungry women set me up
And if you think I'm that stupid you done pressed your luck
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned

[Kon Artis]
You damn right, yes I love menage-a-trois
And I got drawers as big as guys's big "wah"
I'm a Trick Daddy nigga, so bitch how you figure
That I wouldn't turn my niggas on to you when I hit ya
I probably could forget ya if I hadn't been drunk
But your badunkadunk, keep my mind on hump
When my mind's on hump it mean my .9's in the trunk
And Denaun got a line for every fine bitch I hunt
Not once, twice, but three times the lover
That your man is, and I'm a freak undercover
I got plans for you, trick, I don't need a baby mother
I got five of them motherfuckers trying to smother me already
We can't go steady, but you can give me head
Give me that, get the hell out my bed, and leave the shed
My chapped lips will cut nipples when breast fed
And on the way, leave the bread with Achmed
I'd love for you to stay but I got another date
With a fat chick that eat cake on playskates
She rubbed my funky ass feet and feed me grapes
Plus my man in the closet ran out of videotape

[Hook]

[Swift]
I'mma make this one thing clear
Ain't no woman here gon' ruin my career
All the hell you doing is pursuing a dream
That's when you find out that life ain't truly what it seems
All these hoes be lying, bullshitting each other
And why the hell Kobe Bryant didn't wear a rubber?
He might as well have went and told the ho that he love her
I'm sure as hell ain't gonna go to court for my mother
Or my wife, and my sisters, so motherfuck a mistress
They signing a contract before these bitches hit this
Never will a woman take me out that way
I keep a RCA camera in their motherfucking face

[Hook]

[Bizarre]
What's your name again? It doesn't matter
My name is Bizzy, a bodyguard for Mr. Mathers
Sit down girl, let me get you a drink
I'mma buy you a mink, and rape you on the sink
From day one, I knew you was a ho
I put a rubber on my toe and fucked you some mo'
Turn around, let me see your nasty ass
Put on a Jason mask while I take off your maxi pad

[Kuniva]
These hoes be on some bullshit, always trying to pull shit
Outta they ass, get mad and put you on blast
Tell 'em bitches how she fucked you, sucked you, put it on you
Boned you, yapping off with they mouth, saying she loved you
All on your dick, calling your phone, spazzing and shit
Having a fit until you feel like calling it quits
Then she starts calling your chick wanting to fight
Every time you show up at a gig she front row with her friends
Flipping you off follow you to the bar, the bathroom
The parking lot, to the car, pissing you off
Until you blackout, now you and the ho is having a scrap out
You get locked up for assault and now you assed out

[Hook]
