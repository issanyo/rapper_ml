[Intro]
Wow, baby

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 1]
The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door but I don't think I'ma answer
Police saying "freeze" (oh!), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, "freeze"? Please, I'm a human being
I have needs! I'm not done, not till I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B, I sing song
It go ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Sike, I joke, I joke! I kid, I kid!
If I offend, I'm sorry! Please, please, forgive!
For I am Triumph, the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Jessica Simpson looks oh, so tempting
Nick, I ain't never seen an ass like that
Every time I see that show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 2]
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying "freeze" (oh!), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, "freeze"? Geez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theater, please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great, big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh
'Cause there's a puppet on my hand (hahaha!)

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year I'll say, "ass" and she'll make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 3]
The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, "Get out, you bozo
I need a new boyfriend!" Hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying "freeze" (oh!), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, "freeze"? My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word "pee-pee"
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit!
Sike, I joke, I joke! I kid, I kid!
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down!

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me, please?
I ain't never seen an ass like that
'Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Outro: Eminem, Dr. Dre, & Triumph]
Woo!
Fuck is wrong with you?
Ha!
Hey blondie, I saved your peroxide ass again!
