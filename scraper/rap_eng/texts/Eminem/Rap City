Whoa Nelly, Tell Angelina Jolie I’m ready
With petroleum jelly, to smear it all over me belly
And tell her she can hit me on me mobile, me celly
And meet in the salami section of the grocery deli
And maybe we can find us an appropriate telly
A motel 6 or 8 it think they both could be helly
I hit it, then I quit it and I told her email me
And don’t call me, I’ll call you, can you feel me? Ho do you smell me?
Animal instinct, cannibalistic, I just ran out of lipstick, man I’m a twisted, sick
Sadistic, son of a bitch, 666, Broke his crucifix made out of sticks then fixed it
Chick chick chick chick chick chick chick chick chick!
Now play it backwards muscle relaxers mixed with liquid
Dilaudid its diluted for a quick fix, your delusional illusions look realistic
..I Need Christopher Reeves to come and lay his verse
I think he can spit it better on Medicine Ball, first
Off I did not even realize the guy died
So I guess them Christopher Reeves jokes ain't gonna fly
Oh! I'm on a roll don't get me started
Anna got pissed at me and tried to push me into the garden
With such accuracy she aims and shoots the target
Cupid's arrow done forced it...
Now look sweetheart it's the, kissing bandit
On a mission to leave Ms. Degeneres Disenchanted
By men now just listen dammit
Mr. Rossi I need no posse I single handed-
-ly will steal your heart with a kiss where should I plant it
Moi! baby its Moi! and my repertoire
Is running around in pink panties and leopard bra's
And negligah, negligée you say tomato I say tomah-to
I'm Tommy Motola Mariah don't stop me I'm on a roll
Oh!
