[Chorus: Eminem]
Cause I can be calm, I can be cool
I can be rude, I can do whatever you want me to do
Whatever you want me to be, I can be it
Whatever side you want me to show you, just let me know
And I'll let you see it, I got a college degree at being
The prick if you push me, won't hesitate to stick my dick in you pussies
So however you want it, we got it, you can get it
Anywhere you like it whichever way you prefer it, cause we serving it
However you want it, Bitch

[Verse 1: helluva]
However, whoever, anytime, whenever, whatever Im coming with 9's or betta
I'll put 2 in your medulla oblongota, walk around this bitch worry free
Like hakuna matata, get grimey ain't a theme boy I'm used to the drama
I take beat to the extreme, man I'll shoot at your momma, man these faggots
Done make me lose all my patience, I got all kinds of guns for all occasions
Got rap niggas running like Walter Payton, hit em with the full matic have em
Harlem Shakin' hop on the phone and make a call to satan, let him know that you coming
So when you get there my dogs is waiting I'll rob you an thank ya, blast ya an shank ya
Even your mans will be like "NOW THAT NIGGA'S GANGSTA"
I don't give a fuck who you with or who you get cause I'm a lunatic an you a bitch

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: helluva]
I'm king kong, I got "I ain't never scared" on my ringtone, that's my theme song
44 with the beam on, if my niggas got drama I'm that shoulder to lean on
Helluva coming thrugh with that soldier fatigue on at they door like DING DONG
Show em the beef on and once its on, there no fixing it, my killas do this shit
For fun, I can't tell em "Don't get in it" don't run up on ya whip, put a whole clip in it
I tell em I owe him one, he'll tell me "don't mention it." You scared to come out, that's alright
We goin' take shifts and shoot up your house all night. Pop four about yo bushes an unload on yo ass
Leave you layin on the street with a hole in yo ass buss a few a come back an run over yo ass
If you think a nigga loony you just don't know the half

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: helluva]
Anytime you ready, I could while out or I could be calm an deadly, I'm like oh dog an menace
Like tom an belly, I'm a cross between jason saddam and freddy. Tougher than leather, Beretta
Tuck under the leather, extended clip, make it seem like i'm bussin foreva. When an got me 3 bananas
And I stuck em together. Leave a motherfucker sick like he under the weather, niggas be like my man sweet
You can't beat him at rappin' , they be like you wrong as hell, when I see him I'll slap him
To be honest I ain't into all that battle rap shit, I got something on my hip
You could battle that bitch? it'll lift you off your feet an make you acrobatic
Tell a joke an ask a nigga what you laughin' at bitch? He ain't know he could get clapped
For that shit go to jail an tell a judge that nigga asked for that shit

[Chorus]
