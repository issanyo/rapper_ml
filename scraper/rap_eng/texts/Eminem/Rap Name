[Verse 1]
Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks
Rap? I been in it ever since I was invented
That's cause a nigga live it
My records wield digits in history – niggas you be the witness
I got the white boys mad at me
Cause Em, signed another black boy like he nigga happy
Caucasians, Marshall knows talent
Obie Trice a riot, that's why he's hired
I hit ya raves, balloons and E's
And bang all your European Pamela Lee's
Fucking ay, or how we say it round my way
"Fo sho", Trice gon' blow
Then I'm off to them shows, I'm off across the globe
'til my accounts all swoll' for young Kobie
Big things, act like ya know me
Not a soul can hold me, I'm here

[Hook]
That's why I ain't got no, (rap name)
The name's (Obie Trice)
(They see me on the streets they be like "Yo he nice!")
So I came to the game ("real name, no gimmicks")
Rap my living... that's why I ain't got no, (Rap Name)
The name's (Obie Trice)
(They see me on the streets they be like "Yo he nice!")
So I came to the game ("real name, no gimmicks")
Rap my living - that's why I ain't got no

[Verse 2]
It didn't take much – one hot single
Smiles and handshakes my man
The industry greeted me with open arms
With no type of flak cause O. Trice got that
Fugaze y'all rap, who gave y'all dat
New wave of mu-zack that you're all loving?
Got your broads on my balls huggin'
Even my next-of-kin's famous (Obie's your cousin?!)
Please believe it, I'm as "Down to Earth" as Chris Rock
Gettin' hit by trucks, starin' at twat
A big cannon in ya G-spot
Me not arrogant girl, me keep them freaks hot
Whether or not you believe my status
I'm prepared to be the baddest on the rap that's happenin'
Put the Mitten back on the map with Mathers and win this

[Hook]
That's why I ain't got no, (rap name)
The name's (Obie Trice)
(They see me on the streets they be like "Yo he nice!")
So I came to the game ("real name, no gimmicks")
Rap my living... that's why I ain't got no, (Rap Name)
The name's (Obie Trice)
(They see me on the streets they be like "Yo he nice!")
So I came to the game ("real name, no gimmicks")
Rap my living - that's why I ain't got no

[Verse 3]
Well I'm drunk right now, but still I got a gun
Beef? [*cocked and two shots*] best-ta run
Cuz when I pop, people's flesh get numb
And whoa.. ya might not make it to ya young
The only one with okay's wanna blaze
Meet my little friends on racks in my den
Pull 'em out, that's when the action begins
And ya block, remind you of Mad Max the film
Deserted, that's word to vacant homes
2002 Trice up in ya headphones
(If it's ya system) Trice up in ya Bose
(If it's ya women) Then Trice up in ya hoes!
I suppose that I am kinda cocky, when it's dealin
With raps, chicks, and cats out to sock me
I handle it like Rocky, Jake Steed
Rakim, Eric B. – O's a G!

[Hook]
That's why I ain't got no, (rap name)
The name's (Obie Trice)
(They see me on the streets they be like "Yo he nice!")
So I came to the game ("real name, no gimmicks")
Rap my living... that's why I ain't got no, (Rap Name)
The name's (Obie Trice)
(They see me on the streets they be like "Yo he nice!")
So I came to the game ("real name, no gimmicks")
Rap my living - that's why I ain't got no

[Outro (Eminem)]
Rap name, rap name, Obie Trice
(You can get stomped by Obie...)
