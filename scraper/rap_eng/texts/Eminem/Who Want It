[Intro: Trick-Trick & Eminem]
Yeah, we back baby!
(Yea, let's go!)
I told y'all I was coming back
(We done time !)
Detroit, what bitch?
It's Trick-Trick !
(Yeah !)
And motherfuckin Slim Shady ! (Hahahahahaaa!)
(What?)
Gettin back yo!
Get your motherfuckin' hands up!

[Verse 1: Trick-Trick]
We've been accused of everything
From chest wets, to death threats
The best yet, and niggas gettin' their neck check
Best check to protect
Detroit is only known know
For the best threats
So bet, we got decks and techs
Collect debt
And rest the goon squad
We reck your whole set
We rep the Mid-West
You reppin niggas get wrong
Speak on your songy songs
Sendin' them home
Stone sprone
And broken bones
Better leave us the fuck alone
Keep it runnin' thru niggas
Can't even stomach what
The D got comin'
Waitin' until they frontin' and poppin' off at the Chopper Boyz
We poppin off shots
Guaranteeing a spot at the top
First place for niggas gettin guys who think you fuckin with Trick and Eminem
No you not motherfucker
So next time you see us
Be sure that you make a hole
And when they mention the D
Get down on all fours

[Hook: Trick-Trick]
Got big killas with big guns (Who want it?)
Come to my hood
Get some (Who want it?)
Wanna start shit in the club boy (Who want it?)
Touched up (Who want it?)
Fucked up (Who want it?) (x2)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Ooh wow, look at the bitches up in this club
Man I'm gettin me some digits fo' I leave up out this mug
And it's like boom pow, wam, bam, thank you ma'am
I ain't kissin you on the lips, but I'll be glad to shake your hand
Now let's get blew out, let's start some shit tonight
Just let me pick the chick that I'mma leave here with tonight
'Fore we get to fighting and threw out
This music makes me rowdy, how they gonna play that new Trick-Trick
And expect no one to get their shit split?
It's just too wild, and one more shot of hypnotic
And I am not in control of my body, I go robotic and blow a fuse out
Homies is like you're startin to stagger
And I'm like: nah that's just my swagger, but I'm dancing with this fat girl
And gettin' loose now, I don't wanna fight, I feel like partying
'Til this idiot dumps his Bacardi on my cardigan and knocks my screws out
It never fails, I'm know I'm going to jail
I might as well take the laces out my shoes now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trick-Trick]
I hear them screamin'
God damn it
There goes the Eminem in 'em !
There ain't no hittin' him
That think that we just cranked up
But he been with them
It's Trick and them
Goon squad gangstas
You can't get to him
We down for the bang and the brawl
But now we killin' him
See ever since we started
You might of had to pardon our hardest
From the largest city
They sayin that we retarded
And charges brought us over
They should just stop
Some of their artists got dropped
You think im playin
Then bring it
Come on lets see what you got
We make the club go bang *Gun shot*
You got that light noise
See ain't nobody fucking with this nigga and this white boy
That been through the realest and the pros
Treated their best like hoes
We put the thugs on
And make him beat it out of them clothes
We don't give a fuck about nothing you used to do
Your record is equalient to high scool musical
No blaming Jimmy Iovine, Paul or Dre
Blame me for everything I say
Cause I got him nigga

[Hook]

[Outro]
No damn body (Hell no !)
Fuckin' around, cuttin these niggas heads off
