[Intro: Busta Rhymes, Eminem & 50 Cent]
Exclusive! Clinton Sparks shit!
Shady, Aftermath, still Aftermath 2006-(a million)
Y'all niggas need to be clear real quick
The motherfuckin' game has changed again (Haha)
MixUnit.Com (G-Unit) a new day nigga

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & 50 Cent]
Too often, is a young nigga, in a coffin
Tryna blossom, got shot down walkin', heh
Bleek a high-to-hot guy, turned cold
Bring the body bag, see the bullet hole and a burned soul
Don't cry, he chose the life
Fast lane, in the brain, he supposed to fight
How you smile at a momma when she lost a child?
(*Gunshots*) They done shot my baby!

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
(Ooh) Pardon Me (ooh) back in the room again
It's time to raise the level of the boom again
(Now who's that?) Bus-A-Bus-A-Bus ra-(*growl*)
See, I ain't do that in a long time
Spit shit, make the streets do more crime
Cop some cribs, top a little more shine
Alright, yeah (Shhh, mmm) I pity y'all
Da way I bang niggas and how I shit on y'all
And spit the slang, big 'em, make your label quit on y'all
And do my thang bitch, from here to Senegal
We gettin' a lotta money, me and my friend Kamal
I take yo money (*spitting sound*) I ain't a friend of y'all *Gunshot*
So much class, my shit'll kill ya, black
(*Imitated gunfire*) when I don't wanna rap
And still I'ma smash and make them bitches make it clap
Soon as i'm finished wit' her homie, I'll give her back

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
We don't play that, we don't play that
Nigga I'm serious, I ain't playin'
(Bitch ass niggas)
We don't play  that, we don't play that
Nigga I'm serious, I ain't playin'
(Bangin' off his shit)
We don't play  that, we don't play that
Nigga I'm serious, I ain't playin'
(Murk you nigga)
We don't play  that, we don't play that
Nigga I'm serious, I ain't playin'
Get familiar!
