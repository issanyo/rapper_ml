Well, Jimmy moved in with his mother
'Cause he ain't got no place to go

[Rabbit (Eminem)]
And now I'm right back in the gutter
With a garbage bag that's full of clothes

[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]
Buss it, buss it, 'cause
You live at home in a trailer
What the hell you gonna do?

[Rabbit (Eminem)]
'Cause I live at home in a trailer
Mom, I'm comin' home to you

[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]
Uh, break it down, uh

[Rabbit (Eminem)]
Well, my name is Jimmy, his name's Greg Buehl
Me, him and you we went to the same school
This ain't cool, I'm in a rage
He's tappin' my mom we're almost the same age
On the microphone I drop bombs
Look at this car, thanks a lot, mom
Here, happy birthday, Rabbit
Here's a brand new car, you can have it
A nineteen-twenty-eight Delta
This shit won't even get me to The Shelter
And I can't even say I'm from Motown
'Cause I'm back in the eight-one-oh now

'Cause I live at home in a trailer
Mom, I'm comin' home to you
