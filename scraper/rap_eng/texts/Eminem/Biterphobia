[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sneaking in through the back door
Fruity MCs get ambushed, rammed and squooshed
Slammed and pushed, crammed and mushed
Then I'm moving on down from the right to left
So bite the meth or prepare to fight to death
To get jacked, attacked, and cracked in two
Smackin' through 'til you're black and blue for actin' true
I'm dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands
Proof that I've been sniffin' on aerosol cans
I'm stomping, I'm kicking, I'm choking, I'm stamping 'em
Clomping 'em, sticking and poking and clamping 'em
To electric chairs and tightening bolts
Hit 'em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts
I'm zapping rappers, singers and dancers
Faster than you can snap your fingers for answers
Cancer is in the flesh, alive and breathing
Surviving by conniving and thieving

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I had a dream I was getting jacked by biters
It felt like I was being attacked by spiders
Developing a fear of biterphobia
I'm holding a gas can and lighter over ya
If I detect ya I'ma pulverize
Dissect your brain, diggin' in your skull for lies
And I'ma torture with material iller
Than a stark raving mad serial killer
I'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is
A major risk to a plagiarist, so beware of the aura
A terror for the horror will scare ya tomorrow
This is an airborne assault of other rappers
Hit the source to better my skills
I head for the border, and run the Galloping Hills
The choice is yours, ‘cause now buddy's noises force
Me to scream 'til my voice is hoarse
‘Cause I'm sick of these jabber jaws
And crap that grab at yours
And savage yours to bite like Labradors
In the range of my double-barrel
And your life is in danger, trouble and peril

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I trample and stamp liars like they were campfires
‘Cause vampires bite on my balls, and clamp pliers
And swing on my big thingamajig
So I'm bringing my nig' Proof for backup when I sing at my gig
‘Cause biters are falling head over heels
In love with every rhyme that I've said over reels
That's how I became paranoid
Chewing my fingernails, pulling my hair annoyed
‘Cause every time you bit it was deliberate
So I'm forced to hit a little quicker with
An ultimatum, I assault and slayed 'em
With rhymes and it's ultimatum just to cultivate 'em
Energetic and imaginative
Pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives
Will reach out and grab you, 9 times out of 10
That's why I'm spilling one-of-a-kind rhymes out a pen
