[Hook]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 1]
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe
With half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid
And tied up with first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan – an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music (Whattup?)
Told me she was going back into using again (Nah)
I said, "Wait, first try this hallucinogen!
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin
C'mere, let's go in here" "Who's in the den?"
It's me and Kelly!"
"My bad, (sorry) let's try another room"
"I don't trust you!"
"Shut up, slut! Chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt-naked, and run in the woods"
"Oh hell, I might as well try 'em, this party is so drab"
"Oh dag"
"What?"
"I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag"
"Huh?"

[Hook]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (I'm sorry!)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 2]
"Yo Sue"
"Get away from me, I don't know you"
"Oh shoot, she's tripping"
"I need to go puke" (bleahh)
"I wasn't trying to turn this into something major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying! I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wigging and spaz out"
She said
"Help me, I think I'm having a seizure"
I said, "I'm high too bitch, quit grabbing my T-shirt! (let go!)
Would you calm down, you're starting to scare me"
She said
"I'm 26 years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook"
(Hello) "I'm over here, Sue, (hi) you're talking to the plant! Look
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
‘Cause I never seen no one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate"

[Hook]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl (whoops!)
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (it’s an accident!)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 3]
"Susan (wait) Where you going? You better be careful"
"Leave me alone, dad, I'm sick of getting my hair pulled"
"I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors
'Fore you do something dumb
I'll be right back, just chill, baby, please?
I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these" (I'ma kill him!)
"John, where's Dave at before I bash you"
"He's in the bathroom; I think he's taking a crap, dude"
"Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, chopping her hair off
And there's only two days left of Spring Break
How long do these things take to wear off?"
"Well, it depends on how many you had"
"I took three, she ate the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs crying out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol"
"She's gonna die dude"
"I know and it's my fault!"
"Oh my God!!!"

[Hook]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world (I'm sorry!)
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (What do I do?)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Outro]
My God, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!
Susan please wake up! Please!
Please wake up!!! What are you doing?!
You're not dead! You're NOT dead!
I know you're not dead!
Wake up, Susan, wake up! Oh God
