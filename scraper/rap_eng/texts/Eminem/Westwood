[Mr. Porter]
Welcome to the ill world of Mr. P yo
Hey keep the talk B
I'm tryna see dough
If it ain't about bread then what we gon


[Intro]
I'm like a white Michael, Vick
Psycho enough to stick Michael J Fox in a microwave with a rock

[Verse 1]
I might like a little Alize with a side of NyQuil and ride a motorcycle bike right through the side of my high school

Satan's disciple with a sniper rifle and a knife in a white diaper liable the shit on you while I snipe you

So dope begits of opiates, what an appropriate way to start off his day, he may just smart off to Dre

He may be hard to contain cause his rages so hard to gauge. See Hannibal ate his face and made Jason gnaw off his leg

Amazing hard-on for razors and blades and anything sharp, even poisonous darts it all plays a major part of his game

Holy water won't ward him off, crucifixes won't do the trick he's so sick it's ridiculous saw the crazy part off his brain and he's still insane, why is there blood stains on his carpet mane?
It's some crazy shit going on in Shady's apartment again

[Verse 2]
News flash I'm still trash, them pills should have killed my ass but they didn't they just made me stronger
It's like they rebuilt my ass, like the six-million dollar man after the crash, it's Aftermath, bitch in my milk glass it's still half empty
Yeah tempt me, hell isn't enough they need to invent somewhere new to send me. As sick as I'm getting they'll stick me in a conventional oven with the rotisserie setting and won't even notice me sweating-
Shit, I done laid a verse, said some foul shit tried to go back fix it fucked around and just made it worse
Yeah I'm back, lookin' no worse for wear, got these faggots mad enough to rip out their hair and start punching the air
Panties so in a bunch that they can't function, it's Shady and Royce yeah, fuck what a dysfunctional pair
So stop acting like a punk get a pair, take a pill and fall the fuck out spill your lunch in the chair

[Verse 3]
I'll do a hundred yard dash
Just to slash Kim Kardash
In the ass with a shard of glass from nick hogans car crash
You'll end up like the passenger of that, don't be a smartass
Yeah laugh when you sit there thinkin that the hard part passed
You haven't seen pain till leatherface flips mane I'll cut your fucking balls off homie my saws off the chain, I chop the bitch in half with it, sawed off her legs and the top half of her torso fucking crawled off insane
I ain't seen shit like that since I went to mike jacks took the Elephant Man's Skull, fucked it and put it right back, handed my dick to Bubbles while he sucked it and licked my nut sack, can't even reach around while I fucked him right in his butt crack

[Outro]
Nah, I ain't takin it back faggot fuck that, I give a fuck about nothin so here's where you fucked up at, don't go touching that can man you don't wanna open up that wait ahh Alchemist, cut that
