[Hook]
So, Just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
It's also Richard cause I feel like you should
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it
I said just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick
When I hold my privates to your first clue, Sherlock, prick!

[Verse 1]
And I would like to introduce myse-self, surprise! Hi, it's Ike
'bout to get my Ike on I come with a life supply of wife beaters
And my Nikes on and a white tee over that iron mic
Lookin' fly tonight, feel like I might die from a spider bite
Come back as Spider-Man, park my Peter inside a dyke
Bitch actin' like she got fuckin' higher standards than Meijer's, right
Had to pry her fingers off the mothafuckin' Breyer's ice cream
With the pliers, like "Ahh!" only a ruthless bastard would do this
Take a toothless bitch with no taste buds to Ruth's Chris
Give her toothpicks, stop on the way home, pick up two Big Bufords
Scrupulous, girl, you got a nice pair, but you're plumb stupid!
So when I pull up in that Benz, don't try to pretend you ain't interested
To impress your stupid ass friends and refuse to get in woman
And get slammed on the ground and snap like a pool stick against cement
If you sick of dick, pretend it's a musical instrument
You get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
I can tell at first glance you're a ho cause your pants are so tight
When you dance with O. Trice, your implants explode
So cold to dykes, the chance is snow in San Francisco
Boy I'm from Detroit city, you live in animosity
That's a fucked up state to be in, such an atrocity
Look where these random thoughts get me in senseless mind babble
"What me? Apologize?" That's just the way the rhyme unravels
And I wouldn't fucking take it back if I time traveled!
