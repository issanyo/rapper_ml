[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain
You'll be taking it slow, feeding my flame
Shuffling the cards of your game
And just in time
In the right place
Suddenly I will play my ace

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ha ha
Treat women like property, possessive like a noun with an apostrophe S's, I'd probably stalk broccoli, yes it's
Socrates with a block of cheese and a dollar stuck in this soda pop machine
Got emcees dropping to knees, copping a plea bargain they keep sobbing, like, "please stop it"
Aftermath, bitch, still Detoxing
Looking for us? We over here like we're eavesdropping
Apparently still mad over what I said last year
On that Vegas track, I just look stupid and stand there
And try to act like I can't hear
What? Sorry dear, but I think Pam Grier just stuck a tampon in my damn ear
Just then Foxy Brown, walks up and knocks me down
Kicks me and socks me, ow

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain

[Verse 2: Karacter]
I'm not scared, I'm just a white kid in a black neighborhood
Side terror
Wipe off this fear, to not thinking clear
I need to get my head straight
I do feel like a Nazi in a Jewish camp
Concentration
A foolish act to puzzle you fools with the coolest raps like Rubik's cube that I stole just to solve then give it back
Stupid face your making bitch
Loose the mask
Oh wait
I'm sorry that's my bad
Looks like shit
Might be obvious and a waste of my time to say you look like the crap from a sewage plant
But as you were saying
Back to your rant
Lex Luther just got circles ran round his puny ass so fast his neck snapped and it dropped his pants
You've just been schooled by Clark Kent
Shopping at the market
In the parking lot next to your apartment and part from it
You tried to look hard as shit but you pooed your pants
And I didn't even get to use superman yet
And he's my strong suit
Fall soon back on, to attack these villains, and kill em just passing em back and forth, feeling em then put an axe in their nads
That's what I call a hacky sack bitch
Cut cut and pass
You think your lucky
It's Chucky the mother fucking assassin
Castrating stuck in the cabinet sucking a bottle of Aspirin
Preparing a statement while he sharpens his blade
Carves it across his face as he coughs
Testing his voice is it raspy
Nope, just naturally nasty
Get ready for the ass whooping he's bout to serve up like a double cheese burger from Arby's

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain

[Verse 3: Karacter]
Dearest resident
Don't flip past this channel and skip it
A paramedic is in your living room slitting scissors through your flannel get up
So get up, feel better, and add up what I said on that chalk board of yours boarded up inside your head
You're almost dead
I'm your guardian
Here we are
Reminiscing this shit as we walk down the hall of wits
Shelve these thoughts
Highlight reel of selfish tall feminist broads
Everyone that's screwed you over when they said they'd call
Seminar, phantom here I am sent to ward these demons off

[Eminem]
Off misogyny
Sodomy, how many chocolaty jell-o pops can he possibly lace, walking atrocity
No wonder you scoff at me, it’s still obvious I invented prick

[Karacter]
Rest in heaven, I'm evidently milking this game like
Her breasts are dripping
Guess I'm busy, but unless you bitches are seven teen and eleven months I don't want to hear the pessimism
Tell the rest I'm on readers digest while I'm on the toilet
Pizza sky rocket
Gossip isn't
Close to the shit
I must be fast, lickity split
There's no exaggeration, I mean it Brittany
A fan of Trina
Get's me like I wanna jam my weener in Christina

[Eminem]
And Serena and Selena
Scarlett Johansson, Tiffani Amber Thiessen
Give me a damn good reason to not wanna slip an Ambien in a Cappuccino
And try to have a threesome with Janet Reno

[Karacter]
Stuff her with cream like a spicy popper of jalapeno
Appetizer, my main meal's Destiny
Now, If I die I'll come back to haunt your back side grizzly
Capitalize the "Ass" in fucking Caspar and Wendy
As Detroit looking like a power outage, just a black out city
Crack house just down the street of McDonalds, where you lost your virginity
Oh dity, I'm out
Explosive, you're left with the call
You might want to

[Eminem]
Head for the fire exits, I'm coming through like a wrecking-ball

[Karacter]
Test us, we're scared of nothing at all

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain
You'll be taking it slow, feeding my flame
Shuffling the cards of your game
And just in time
In the right place
Suddenly I will play my ace
