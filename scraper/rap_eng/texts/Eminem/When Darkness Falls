[Verse 1]
If the deaf could hear and the blind could see
Would the deaf listen? Would the blind still be
In the darkness? (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls... and when you cry I can still see
If you want to die, well then come with me
In the darkness (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls a jade green flower, and early blue
She lets dirty men in her precious womb
In the darkness (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls a rich king sits right on his throne
A shade full soul, he shall die alone
In the darkness (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls on you

[Hook]
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls

[Verse 2]
You say your God doesn't treat you right
Would you stop praying? Would you trade your life
For the darkness? (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls... I believe my greatest trick
I made you think I didn't exist
In the darkness (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls... even though many have seen despair
Our loyal subjects, they would not dare
Choose the darkness (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls... Sex, drugs rapid. Rock and roll
These higher tragedies to behold
In the darkness (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls on you

[Hook]
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls

[Verse 3]
This song is for every kid who's disturbed. Every geek, every nerd
All my ghetto children that lay on the curb
A ruler who can so influence you and give you the nerve
To turn that pain and that hurt into some anger and burns
You damn angrier than everybody whos faces is heard
Shoot random, 27 bodies is facin the curb
Practices using voodoo, oujia boards, he prays with these cults
He casts upon you, your first born will vacate his birth
You sweatin through hot flames while I'm sayin this verse
Armageddon, you shall remain if you ain't praised in this world
Life is messy. Careful, you may got blood stains on your shirt
You don't like the ways things are going? Trust me, death can't be worse
Make your choice. Self murder or get saved in a church
While the pure virgin Mary carries this baby of hers
You were sent to wash away sins that remain in this world
Things go good again, but then a dark change will occur

[Hook]
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls
