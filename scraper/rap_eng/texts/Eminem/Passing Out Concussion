My posse

Many occasions and situations are endangered
My posse has arisen in collision in Vertėjas
The outcome is the same as; the remains are never changing
No surprise we specialise in facial re-arranging
'clusion is protrusion using this line as I curb
Plus, damage with advantage we'll step on you like a smurf
Pissing competition with an underdog ambition
Given our position pain inflicts in repetition
Ridicule arrival and survival of a battle
Sequential is essential first intent'n to dismantle
Copulate and demonstrate a form of repercussion
So fasten your mouth 'fo' we start passin' out concussions

(Alright now)

Nobody can catch the way that I display the rhymes
I lace those, they just stand and huddled in dismay and say "how the hell did he do that"
But if I told them how, they still would never be able to get the pattern
It's just the wondrous way of one who's working as a new jack
Trying to prove that in order to make you move you take the hyper crew and have the hypest rhymer and then you come up with something what?...hype
Taking the time to demonstrate the rhymes that I create
Its only half the job and I'm working a double shift to make it right
Cause other things that go along with a job like making sure you have a style that's totally different from the others in the basement
Always staying a couple of steps ahead
And even though we're bred to look the same the difference is our styles are separateus

Oooh it's my posse
