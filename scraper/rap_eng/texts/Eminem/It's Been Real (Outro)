[Hook]
Thanks it's been real
I love you but I just can't deal
With the stress this game is giving me...
But before I go
You know
I can't close the show
Without no closure
So before I leave...

[Eminem talking]
Yeah
I just want to take the time out
To basically say
Rest In Peace
To Deshaun Holton
That's my heart man
Dr. Dre
For giving me the opportunity
Just to even listen to me
To get me to this point
I wanna thank Jimmy Iovine
Interscope, Aftermath
Everybody in the whole Shady staff
Everybody whoâ€™s basically supported me from day one
Paul Rosenberg, Tracy McNew
You know I love you guys
I couldn't do it all without you
D12
Ca$his, you're gonna be a beast when you get out there man
Trust me homie, my ears don't lie to me
Who else am I forgetting
Oh yeah, Obie Trice
Bobby Creekwater, and basically man
The whole city of Detroit
8 mile road for making what I am today
Which basically goes back to Proof and D12
I love you guys man
Runyon Ave for holding me down when shit got thick
Oh, it wouldn't be complete, If I didn't
Thank my mom, bitch
So
