[Intro]
D.A

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Slide on a pimp game with my pinky ring
Lotta gang, lotta bitches, and a icy chain
Why you claim that you rich? That's a false claim
I be straight to the whip, no baggage claim
Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name
You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram
I be rockin' it like it's fresh out the pan
Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman
Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift the hand
3 million cash, call me rain man
Money like a shower, that's my rain dance
And we all in black, like it's Gangland
Say the wrong word, you be hangman
Watch me stick to your bitch like a spray tan
Aw, Mr. 'What Kind Of Car He In?'
In the city love my name, nigga I ain't gotta say it

[Chorus: Tyga]
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, fuck what a nigga say
It's all the same, like Mary-Kate
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, let you get a taste
Taste, taste, do you love the taste?
Yeah that's cool but he ain't like me

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
From the BART train to a tour bus
Still the same game except I'm pulling more sluts
More butts, more bucks, never giving more fucks
Did it my way, I'm never taking short cuts
Raised in that town like fool, who put you upon?
All these bay sounds, Mac Dre is who I grew up on
I'm just selling game got you if you need a coupon
You can check my resume, see every beat I threw up on
Smoking on grapes, rollin' up swishers, no papes
Back of the Ghost, closed drapes
I'm a boss tycoon
Girls in the crowd all swoon
Super high, I'm off to the moon
And I vanished with your girl then I took her to my room
She wants me to slay okay, that means doom
Boom, and it's to be expected
Knew this would happen as soon as she texted

[Chorus: Tyga]
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, fuck what a nigga say
It's all the same, like Mary-Kate
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, let you get a taste
Taste, taste, do you love the taste?
Yeah that's cool

[Verse 3: Offset]

Yeah, I'ma put the drip on the plate (drip, drip)
Diamond ice glacier, niggas imitate (ice, ice)
Aye, aye feed me grapes Maybach with the drac' (grape)
Slow pace in the Wraith, got this shit from bae (skrt)
Diamonds up to par, the cookie hittin' hard (hard)
The Rari sit in park, I'm at it, on Mars (mars)
Shotgun shells, we gon' always hit the target (blaow)
Popcorn bitch shell poppin' out the cartridge (pop it)
3400 Nawfside, Charles Barkley (Nawf)

Make her get on top of me and ride me like a Harley (ride)
She wanna keep me company and never want depart me (no)
(Depart me) Yeah, fishtail in the parking lot (skrt, skrt)
I don't kick it with these niggas 'cause they talk about ya (Yeah)
And I got the fire, don't make me spark it out ya (fire)
Keep it in my back pocket like it's a wallet (hoo)
Like the way she suck it, suck it like a Jolly (whoa)
Stack it up and put it with the whole project (racks)
And she got the Patek on water moccasin (water moccasin)
I'm rich in real life, I get that profit, copy (hey!)

[Chorus: Tyga]
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, let you get a taste
Taste, taste, do you love the taste?
Yeah, that's cool, but he ain't like me
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, fuck what a nigga say
It's all the same, like Mary-Kate
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, let you get a taste
Taste, taste, do you love the taste?
Yeah that's cool

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride with it
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish
Yeahhh, me and Nate d-o double g
Looking for a couple bitches with some double d's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbuly, we (we)
Pasted, plastered, puke, drink up, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin
Still got a few chunks on your shoestring showin
I was dehydrated 'till the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg in to sing some shit

[Outro: Tyga]
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, let you get a taste
Taste, taste, do you love the taste?
Yeah, that's cool, but he ain't like me
Taste, taste, LA you can get a taste
Taste, taste, Miami you can get a taste
Taste, taste, Oakland you can get a taste
Taste, taste, New York do you love the taste?
Taste, taste, Chi-Town you can get a taste
Taste, taste, Houston you can get a taste
Taste, taste, Portland you can get a taste
Taste, taste, overseas let them bitches taste
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, do you love the taste?
Taste, taste, worldwide they gon' get a taste
