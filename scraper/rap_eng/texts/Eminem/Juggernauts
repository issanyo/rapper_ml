[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Hey, we ain’t really gotta keep going through this
If anybody wanna rap circles 'round you, my nigga, we 'bout to do it
You about that bitch, dough, and that swag, that’s it
Let me talk about us, we about that bitch, dough and that swag
We about that sitting on that ave
And because we sitting on that ave
We about that pistol in that bag
We about that fist fight, only after we grab a fist full of that cash
We about that get right, what you have perceived the least but not last
We are the sickest scribbling with that pen, that pencil and that pad
And y'all talking this and that, so what
My clique can wrap my dough up
Now picture that, I write the sloppiest verses down you seen
I hand it in for green
So I can buy all of my bitches bags with the stacks
And call the cash chicken scratch
Slaughter baby we just getting warm
Y'all ain't fucking nothing we can't fuck
Y'all ain't driving nothing we can't drive
If we can't afford it we just take yours
See ya'll little niggas just misinformed
Shady blew up, took the game, turn around
And ten years later he gave it to the

[Hook x2: Eminem]
Juggernauts of this rap shit (7x)
Like it or not

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Some of you niggas is bitches too, you rocking panties, huh
Sit down when you pissing too, you niggas trannies, huh
What you stand for is beneath me, you understand me, huh
Niggas get X'd like the professor and juggernauts running our family, huh
Homie I was making checks before that Martin Margiela
And niggas was rocking Avirex, now hot rappers date my ex-s
And I'm still rated X, stick my dick so far in a bitch's throat
It'll come out the other side and turn a blowjob into anal sex
Ain’t no next, cause I got now until I decide to to bow, avow your style
It ain’t gonna mean a thang cause I came to bring the pain like Tical
Nigga, now, we're the juggernauts to this rap shit
Bust a shot with ya ratchet
When suckas dropping that whack shit

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Ask them hood niggas if I hug the block
Ask these broads if I slide on that glove and uppercut that box
Man I come from the roughest so if I come up in the spot
And you bugging I’m tellin you suckas watch, I’m a take off that fucking watch
And scratch a, bitch, I'll be on a nigga ear, scream Juggernaut
He hot, that don’t mean that he nice, y'all get that confused a lot
2Pac, I don’t sacrifice what I write for the newest drop
Big Pop, us big boys still clean down to the socks
Then sprinkle a little Big L on top
I’m what the fuck you got, put Porter rock
With a pen and Eminem as a friend I’m touching this Entenmanns
That’s cake, you little boys don’t get it so listen let’s make amends
We don’t wanna be bullies, y’all wanna get beat up
So lift your knees up and start running
Or put your knees down on the ground and bow cause we the

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Look, it's House Gang on that shady street
Chill, y'all already know the address
Where the eulogy's said, so they assuming he's dead
Before that body hit that bag yet
Be face to face with them slugs
Sad cause my goons ain’t load that mag yet
In the bottom of the ocean floating
They hoping they gon find your ass with that drag net (nah)
(Blat, blat, blat) You're listening to a juggernaut
She just gon' sit by the pool 'til one nigga decide if I’m ready to fuck or not
Rap is contingent on everything other than rap, so no we ain’t discussed a lot
It's sad when they wasting your passion
Not do it for cash when they tell me they up the pot
Nigga you would too, if you knew, what this game would do to you
Been in this since 2002, look at all the bullshit I've been through
So-called beef with nobody's, I mention them and they nobody's
They say they killers, got no bodies, I’m sober talkin on no molly's
It’s Joe probably won’t throw not one bottle in the club
Honestly, it's worthless killing the purpose of these hollows in these gloves
And really I’m having a much better time on the couch with these models on my nuts
The minute we raid is the minute you’ll see us show these cock-a-roaches love (waddup)

[Outro: Joe Budden]
What on Earth will the Fuck Boys do next?
That’s right
Same shit they been doing
Getting fucked
