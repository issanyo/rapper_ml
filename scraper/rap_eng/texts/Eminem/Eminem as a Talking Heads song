[Verse 1]
I've got a rhyming disease
In my head, everything rhymes
I write and write until I can't
'Til my brain hurts
Lyrics in my head all the time
I've made a lotta songs
I don't know how many I've made
But, I've made a lotta songs
And I write everyday

[Chorus]
I put my orange four-inch door hinge in storage
And ate porridge with George
People say the word "orange" doesn't rhyme with anything

[Verse 2]
From the hi-hat to the snare to the vocals
I love beats and rhymes
Just the craft of it, I was in the rap olympics
Rapping and singing and dancing and I am white
Something about the pen and paper
I can look at all my ideas and I can see 'em
If I don't got paper I'll write it on my hand
Fill up the hand and I'll transfer it to paper

[Chorus]
I put my orange four-inch door hinge in storage
And ate porridge with George
People say the word "orange" doesn't rhyme with anything
I put my orange four-inch door hinge in storage
And ate porridge with George
People say the word "orange" doesn't rhyme with anything

[Spoken Word Interlude]
Words are like puzzles
How can I figure this puzzle out?
How can I take words and put them at the end of the sentence, but in between maybe make some words rhyme in between the rhyme?
And like sandwich 'em

[Verse 3]
I've been bored with the english language
Wordplay and metaphors and similes
Multi-syllable rhyming, stream of consciousness
I've got a rhyming disease

[Chorus]
I put my orange four-inch door hinge in storage
And ate porridge with George
People say the word "orange" doesn't rhyme with anything
I put my orange four-inch door hinge in storage
And ate porridge with George
People say that the word "orange" doesn't rhyme with anything
