[Verse 1]
Comin' to you live at Shade 45 Invasion
The only radio station that plays in rotation
The Shady the slash with the Aftermath with the little Jay on occasion
Maybe you may hear some Jada mixed with a plate of some D Block
Splash of 2Pac
One being that we don't cater cause we gonna play the fuck
Outta whatever we want this is Shady
And we gonna pump, pump the fuck out our own shit
From 50, Obie, Twizzy, Stat Quo
And we won't quit fuckin' you up
And we can keep sayin' fuckin' you up
Even till the FCC sayin' shut this dude up
Duck tape a his mouth a do somethin'
Quick fucka do fuck poppa do pop
Skippy dippy pop shit bitch asshole you son of a bitch! Chinga tu madre!
I start drama all day hemm delala
Comin' across your scanners it's the brand new station
Shade 45, motherfuckin' Slim Shady bitch and Green Lantern
Shady in the place to be, see
And it takes what I got to rock the mic right
And that was a freestyle too bitch so suck my dick if you do not like
