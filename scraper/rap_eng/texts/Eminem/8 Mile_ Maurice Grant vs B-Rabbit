[Maurice Grant]
The Shelter
Let me get up in this nigga like smashin'
With a red beam Johny blastin'
Evil is the rhyme assassin
Get a guy runnin', like haulin' ass
Bury you pink rabbits for askin'
Closed caption nigga don't say a word
When these flames get to burnin' up
Burnin' you down
Leavin' you ground tore up
From the pressure
Wanna frown
Don't want the nigga known pullin' triggers
Hoist this fool on my neck back-break this nigga

[B-Rabbit]
Yo
Check it out
Look, look
Yo, I gotta flow
I'm from the Mo, you ain't Detroit, hoe
Talkin' about seven mile, change your style
I read your bio, you're really from Ohio
I'm vile
This guy's so fuckin' fat I can't even see his eyes when he smiles
Yo, listen to this
Motherfuckin' rhyme, yo chicken, we can do this
As a matter of fact have another beer
I'll be right back, dawg, I'ma set the mic right here
