[Eminem knocks the door.]
[Eminem sighs and the door opens.]

"What up?"
"Have a seat. Dre, I'll call you back."
[Steve hangs up the phone.]
"What now?"
"I don't even know where to start..."
"Okay...?"
"I got the album from upstairs..."
"And..."
"And this, is by far, the most..."
[Eminem cocks a gun and shoots at Steve.]
