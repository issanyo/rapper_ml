Weed lacer
'97 burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary
Had to ditch the Mercury Tracer
I'm on some Loc shit
Some fed up wit the 'being broke' shit
I'm not to joke with
Bitch, I don't sell crack
I smoke it
Having a coke fit and going through withdrawals daily
Shoot up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailey
My brains dusted
I'm disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets
Empty medicine cabinets
Losing battles to wack rappers because I'm always too blunted
Walking up in the cypher smoking
Talking about, "Who want it"
Thug and a crook
Every drug in the book
I've done it
My 9's at your brain
Is that your chain
Run it
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavour
Aggressive nature's got me sticking you for your progressive pager
Spectacular
Battle rap manufacturer
Stole your mama's Acura
Wrecked it and sold it back to her
Cruise in Nike jackets
Escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me
"I might be back quick"
So barricade your entrance
Put up some extra fences
A woman beater
Wanted for repeated sex offences
Chasing dips
Take them on long vacation trips
Kidnapping them and trapping them in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips
Slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Got you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama don't you cry
Your son's too far gone
I'm so high
I don't even know what label I'm on
I'm messed up
I feel just like an overworked plumber
I'm sick of the crap
What's Jack Kevorkian's phone number
