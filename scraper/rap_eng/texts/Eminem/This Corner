[Intro]
Hey look let me tell y'all somethin' alright?
What I do, I do. Straight like that
So ain't no sense in y'all troublin' yourselves over that
Cause man the way I feel right now today

[Verse 1]
I came up on the wrong side of the fence
I gave my family pain and strife and asked them all for strength
But hell in my defense
And I got too much way too fast
My mama told me it won't last
Now I'm back down on the bottom
Wishin' that I took another path
I should've listened, but my mind was gone
My temper too quick so when my fuse get lit
So when it's on, it's on
Yeah, everybody wrong
Yeah, and I'm always right
Yeah, ain't nobody to blame now
It's me vs. me, man, this my fight

[Hook]
So don't look at me like I am the same person I was before
We all deserve a second chance and this time I think I can do more
I'm better

[Post-Hook]
Yeah I put that on my family, all you gotta do is give me the chance
And I can show you that I'm worthy of the trust that you require
Put it all on my shoulders, I'm a fighter, I won't get tired
When I'm back up in this corner, back up in this corner, tryna get out
Back up in this corner, back up in this corner, gotta get out

[Verse 2]
You think I got none but I got all kind of sense
Stop judgin' my book by the cover
Maybe you should do a little reconnaissance
I ain't tryna vent, this ain't woe is me
It's nothing owed to me
Get the swan song, I don't need an ode to me
Shit hopefully holdin' this rosary'll keep me out of close calls with the O police
I said I'm tryna be a whole new me
I ain't tryna do the same old thing
I'm tryna prove to my family that I will not bring
No more trouble around, I ain't gotta do nothing
But stay out of shit, I ain't gotta be up in the chaotic
Prolly cause it's my redemption that I'm entrenched in
And I won't let anybody deny my vision, it's my decision
But y'all ain't listenin'

[Hook]
So don't look at me like I am the same person I was before
We all deserve a second chance and this time I think I can do more
I'm better

[Post-Hook]
Yeah I put that on my family, all you gotta do is give me the chance
And I can show you that I'm worthy of the trust that you require
Put it all on my shoulders, I'm a fighter, I won't get tired
When I'm back up in this corner, back up in this corner, tryna get out
Back up in this corner, back up in this corner, gotta get out
Back up in this corner, back up in this corner

[Verse 3]
It's my gameplan now
To get in this ring and show that I'm a changed man and how
I won't blow another chance to make you proud
Even though you got the right to hate me now
I know you lost your hope in me
But hopefully I can restore it back where it's supposed to be
I just want my daughter back, this fight means much more than that
I'm tryna think before I react, I ain't get the message at first
I tried to ignore the facts
But I'm much older, she's my soldier, I told you I'd go to war for that
I said your boy is the truth and it's no lie in him
All he needs is his family with him
Y'all want him 'til it's no room given
I'ma hit him 'til the ref come and get him

[Hook]
So don't look at me like I am the same person I was before
We all deserve a second chance and this time I think I can do more
I'm better
