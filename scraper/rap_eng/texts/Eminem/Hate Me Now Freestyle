[Intro: Eminem & Proof Singing]
You can hate me now
But I won't stop now
But I can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now
(Proof: Don't hate us)
Bop me and degrade me now
I'm blowing up now
(Proof: He's blowing up)
I'm so drunk now I'm throwin' up now
(Proof: Throwin' up now)
You can hate me now
(Proof: You can hate us now)
You can deflate me now

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Hand me an 8
Beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world and spit on Brandy and Ma$e
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white person trapped in a room with Lauryn Hill
Human horror film but with a lot funnier plot
And people will feel me cause I'ma still be the Madd Rapper
Whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddling, making fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in the Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back striking at Ford
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicodin for
Everybody's pissing me off
Even the 'No Limit' tank looks like a middle finger sideways
Flipping me off
No "duh" I'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would I kill you
Then jump in the grave then bury myself

[Interlude]

Eminem: You can hate me now
Proof: Hate us!  Ha! Ha! Ya!

[Verse 2: Proof]
Need to run for cover
Eminem is white but he's still my brother
Slim Shady, known to go and smoke crack
But you and Charli Baltimore got something in common
You both wack, how you feel about that?
No need to jock 'em
You so wack you make Master P sound like Rakim
When it's time to bust y'all when we trust y'all
We dust y'all, who y'all I break your balls like cue balls
I know who you are, you RuPaul, do stall
For those that try to fall and try to brawl
All y'all get bust up and banged up, framed up
How many MC bring my name up, the same slut
Said the same thing as freestyle, don't need to rehearse
My verse is universal, curse a flow
Crush you like Hershel Walker, Allie Sparker
Three day sparker highland Parker chalker
You MCs can't get darker than the Midwest bracket
It's us, me and Emzee, come right there, we feeling flimsy
Tipsed up, one time lifetime we ripped up
It's bad to the evil , met that, now it's all to say
Death rap, fuck hoes, don't even say get blast away, passed away
Blasted ass, hey yo, they say we're Aftermath
Slim Shady, you heard that, my words black
But bust you up because you preferred that
To hear me now, preferred that, the surgical snipe
Preserved you with life, I'll make you allergic to life
You die for this, don't even battle us
See us. At the. With that. Subterreanean
We knock your brain in

[End rap, commence Eminem, Proof and Tim Westwood goofing with each other and the Tim Westwood explosion sounds]
