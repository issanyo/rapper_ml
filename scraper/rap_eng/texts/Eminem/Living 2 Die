[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Verse: Freddie Gibbs]
I'm a rebel, I don't give a fuck about rules
Fuck college, I don't give a fuck about school
But you ass if you assume that I'm not smart
Because I made bad grades in the classroom
When I'm hustlin' I got a A average
Student of the game, I know how to make cabbage
I'm a street soldier that get no rest
Stickin' niggas for the cream is my M-O-S
And I'm always hungry, ready to eat
I got a appetite for war so I cook the beef
Ever since I was a shorty, niggas actin' ludicrous
So I rolled out wit' my twin Glock 40's
You know that I'm the illest through word of mouth
And i don't toot my own horn cause you know what I'm 'bout
Man I ain't gotta caddy truck or Chevy on dubs
I got a mean mug and a 38 snub
Don't try to be like Freddie, you ain't him
Don't compare me to other rappers, I ain't them
You might've seen me in a magazine lookin' crucial
I ain't pose wit' a gun cause you know I'd shoot you dog
I come in ya face wit' two guns up
And leave a muthafucka slumped in his Yukon truck
They say the good die young but the bad guys die by the same fate
Get bullet holes put in the same place, we Heavyweights
And nah, I ain't finished
Don't include me in yo' petty beef, I ain't in it
Cause if I'm in it then it's on, fuck writin' another song
I'mma show up at yo' home, put the toast to yo' dome
Cause niggas get clapped and shit get deeper than rap
So I suggest you don't go deeper than that
So before you diss Fred, use yo' head
You don't wanna end up dead over somethin' you said
I ain't sayin' I'mma kill you if you diss me on the mic
I'm sayin' I'mma kill you if you threaten my life
A couple rappers they be sayin' they gon' kill me on sight
It's fucked up cause I see them niggas every night
And they don't jump it off cause they bitch made
If I ain't got a gun then I'mma slit yo' throat wit' a switchblade
Take me out, I wish a nigga would try
I'm in the streets dyin' to live and livin' to die
And that's for real

[Outro: Freddie Gibbs]
Ugh, I'm livin' to die, come get me if you want bitch
Yeah, I done ducked down plenty of times man
A lot of cats is on these records talkin' this trash
How you gon' murk this, kill this, hurt this
A lot of y'all niggas still doin' nothin' man
Before you gon' say you gon' kill another nigga on a track man be able to back that up man
Cause a lot of y'all can not back that up man
Y'all just makin' these silly little threats out here man
Don't bring them my way
Serious, I'mma bring it back man
Rest in peace to everybody fallen
All the fallen soldiers, 2Pac, Biggie, Big L, Big Pun, Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah, Aaliyah, everybody man
Rest in peace to my grandfather, my uncle Wayne
Mike Langford, Quade Shepard, my homies I lost
Comin' up man we all dyin' to live, livin' to die
We make it through though
