Don't ask me what's up with the hoes, I'm still working the kinks out
Love stinks, that explains all this anger that's spillin' out
And I ain't chilling out. Got an Oscar but I'm still a grouch
I use it as a doorstop and a prop for the broken leg for the couch
Yelawolf, Shady, Tony-Touch, Slaughterhouse
Yeah the SWAT team 'bout to break them flyswatters out
Go to hell in a drought, break ice waters out
Nice try shorty wop, we can windowshop the jewelry store
But Christ for that price coulda bought a house
Besides only thing I ever had iced out was my heart since I started out
Itâ€™s F.Y.I, if ya ain't knowing
What, go with you? Where? Nah, ain't going
Oh wait, you wanna date? Oh, well in that case ho, it's June 8th, oh!
And kinda like Beethoven composin' a symphony of hate
So much hate woven into these raps
He stitches a bitch, straight sewin'
Shit, I'm beginning to hate clothing
I hate overalls cause they remind me of hoes
For Christ sake, they're shaped like an H woah and
You know what else starts with H though?
Hockey, shit, thought I had the place flowing
I hate to put you on ice but
You already had 3 periods in 60 minutes, great going
Plus you remind me of cocaine, ho
You always in the mirror with your face
So, I feel an urge to put you all in a line
And chop you with a razor blade, yo wait, I'm an a-hole
Devil with a halo
Hell yeah, I'd nail J-Lo to the railroad
Say I won't! Better hope you can stay afloat
When I take the wind out your sailboat
But, I ain't playing yo! Dope as Shady?
Don't kid yourself, bitch you ain't even a baby goat
