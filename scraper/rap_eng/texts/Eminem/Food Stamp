Yo yo yo

My mom sent me up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (Here)
Two dudes ran up, jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him and bit him
He came back with six or seven dudes screaming "Get him!"
I grabbed one, lit him on fire, pinned and bit him
The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept droppin' 'em in a rhythm
Then I woke up swingin' in the middle of the kitchen

(Damn... damn... damn...)
