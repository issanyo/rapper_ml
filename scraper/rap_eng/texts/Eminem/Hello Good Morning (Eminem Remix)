[Intro]
Hello, Good morning
Let’s go, let’s ride
Hello, Good morning
Hello, Good morning
Know you’ve been waiting for it
’cause I seen you watching
So let’s go
Let’s get it popping

[Hook]
Cause I’ve been leaning on the bar
Looking cleaner than the star
All these broads won’t give me my props
25 on the bank I be stunting on there ass
And they mad cause the bitch won’t stop

Got your boyfriend feeling like a groupie
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
Stuntin like you looking like a movie
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
And everybody know who the truth be
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
I blow cause I’m blowing on the moo-wee
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
Hello

[Bridge]
Hello, Good morning
Let’s go, let’s ride
Hello, Good morning
Hello, Good evening
You blow, you feindin’
’cause you know that your really needed
And I’m the one that you wanna be with
But right now baby you dreaming
Wake up and turn the lights off

[Verse: Eminem]
Hello and Good Morning
Baby I didn’t mean to turn it bad
I know you’re feeling angry just a tad
Cause I took you through the drive-thru and made you pay the tab
Girl I’m so cheap I can turn your Happy Meal sad
You're loco, don’t bother mistaking me for a mogul
I’m more like Fogell, McLovin’, McDonald's McMuffin
Breakfast burritos, Fritos, Cheetos, Doritos, Tostitos
That’ll be the only thing I feed hoes!
So baby anything with a dollar menu I treat you
My back hand is lethal so I keep you at arms length
So I can always reach you
Get a knee to the gut, thats the only way I say I need you
Lady I’m just trying to get a rim job off the deal
And I ain't talkin’ Giovanni’s on the wheels
So let me see you mommies get ya tail feathers kicking
I’m here to cock block like a square male chicken, come on

[Hook]
