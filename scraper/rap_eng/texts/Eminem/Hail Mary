[Intro: Eminem]
Makaveli rest in peace
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Mouth like a 12 gauge shotty
And Ja said he should be
The lost forgotten seed of 2Pac
To lead this industry into the ways of the man
Follow me!

[Hook: Eminem]
Come get me
If you motherfuckers want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You ain't no killer, you a pussy
That Ecstasy done got you all emotional and mushy
Bitches wearing rags in photos, Ja's words being quoted
In The Source, stealing Pac's shit like he just wrote it
You loud mouths pray to god hoping no one's listening
See 50 coming for me, Oh my god ma, my position
No one will pay attention to me
Please Gotti, here I go, give me this pill
Ecstasy done got me feeling so invincible
Now all of a sudden I'm a fucking madman who screams
Like I'm Pac but I'm not, enemies, Hennessey
Acting like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm crazy
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fucked from this shit
I'm stuck, I'm addicted to these drugs, I'mma quit
Saying motherfuckers names before somebody fucks me up
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you in hell, fucker

[Hook: Eminem]
Come get me
If you motherfuckers want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Get off that E
Before you try to come and fuck with me
It's Aftermath here now
Shady Records got it locked
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-locked

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wasting
Institutionalized, my bitches bring me product by the bundles
Hustle hard from a cell, G-Unit motherfucker, we balling
Catch me counting cheese and when I'm calling, can you accept my call
CEO let me sip on Hennessey, can I sip some more
Hell, I done been to jail, I ain't scared
Mama checking in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Motherfuckers thinking they can stop 50, they losing it
Lil' nigga named Ja think he live like me
Talking 'bout he left the hospital, took 9 like me
You live in fantasies nigga, I reject your deposit
When your lil' sweet ass gon' come out of the closet?
Now he wondering why DMX blowed him out
Next time grown folks talking bitch, close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real niggas ball to let these bitch niggas beat me
Black, you's a motherfucking punk and you can see me with gloves
Quit scaring them fucking kids with your ugly ass mug
And you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's going on
Nigga payback, Tah, I know your bitch ass from way back
Witnessed me strapped with Macs, you know I donâ€™t play that
All these old rappers trying to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Irv looking like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Trying to playa hate on my shit, man eat a fat dick
Loving this shit that's how you made me
Feeling like I got you niggas crazy
Against all odds, hoping my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio getting blow
To the truest shit I ever spoke
21 gun salute

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
I've been one of the most humble, rep the streets to the core
Hey Jeffrey, what the fuck you come involving me for
It's been a long time coming, like a bless and a check
You see 106 and Park fans don't even fucking respect you
It's kinda funny, wannabe Pac, wanna fake like you thug
Running around talking shit that he ain't capable of
Now let me off this cocksucker whilst we handle you, nigga
If I recall, Violator use to manage you, nigga
Then took a closer look and realized you was an imposter
There's never been a Violator on a Murda Inc roster
Dumb ass, now who's shooting? Ah made you look
You said Bus singing the same old hook, you stupid
If y'all shooting, I take a look at your man
The bitch shot himself in front of Def Jam
Cheddar Bob ass nigga start adjusting your plan
You let the streets down nigga, 'pologize to your fans
Watch you pull a little stunt like we ain't know what it was
Little faggot desperate trying to re-establish a buzz
I know the shit is driving you crazy, you wondering how
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice, what you gonna do now
Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefing with you
I think about the game and what it's like and what would it be without you
I'm finished, I ain't trying to repeat this
Just cause I'm cool, you shouldn't take my kindness for weakness

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
It was fun
Next time you got a problem with me
Address me before you try to make shit a public issue homie
Now I'mma return back to my regular self
And have fun again
One

[50 Cent]
Hahaha, BITCH! Haha
OUTLAWZ, haha
Makaveli the don, haha
Since you want to be 2Pac, motherfucker, hahaha
2Pac shoes too big for you to walk in you lil' faggot, hahaha

(What do we have here now?)
