[Hook: Eminem + (T.I.)]
When we touch down, (in the Midwest we okay
E'rybody know them southern boys love that bass)
Atlanta go bananas, Alabama, 'weesiana
Mississippi, Ten-a-keys, every muh'fuckin' state
When we touch down
(Go right from the plane to the Range)
When we touch down
(On a private plane, gettin' brains, 'til we)
Touch down, there ain't no way to keep 'em quiet
With T.I. and Shady, baby
We 'bout to incite a riot when we touch down

[Verse 1: T.I.]
When we get in town, you know how we gettin' down
Pull up clean, then we hop on out
Snatch all the freaks, then walk on out
I'm livin' what they talking 'bout, shinin' if it dark or not
That one hundred E-X-double R
You'll find that in the parkin' lot
You barkin' up the wrong tree, I do this shit for zone three
Four, five and six as well as one, Atlanta I'm forever, son
Still be on whatever coke, ridin' blowin' heavy smoke
Aye, Em, you better tell them folk, won't hesitate to let 'em go
They know I put that green light on them haters
Keep on tryin' me, I put that beam right on your tater (pow!)
Now you don't wanna see T.I.P. outrageous
Try to keep him in a cage, but somehow he keep escapin'
That's why I be on vacation, Virgin Island I be takin'
Private planes out to Spain, I keep on flyin', I ain't fakin'
The money ain't a thang, think I'm lyin', you're mistaken
You can find long lines of all kinds of bitches waitin'

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Welcome to the Midwest, yes, where them Detroit playas ball
Like you have no idea, the boy is here
Got the whole place looking like it's candy painted
Ain't it like we left the kids at home
And just let 'em loose with the crayons?
Fuck, I just hit a jogger, people lookin' like Frogger
They hoppin' out of the way
Whenever they see Marshall's car comin'
The kids painted my windows with black permanent marker
And let the rest of the car carpet color like swirl pops
And I got the bass thumpin'
But I'm bound to bump into somethin'
Kids are flyin' through the air lookin' like they krumpin'
The way they tumblin', I gotta do somethin'
But as soon as I hit the car wash to get the tar off
They just right back at it tomorrow
They're like, "Dad, this is in, so you're with the trends."
"This is for the pimps
Listening to Mims, nail polish on the rims."
And now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show
So go on with your bad self, just have it back to normal

[Verse 3: T.I.]
From my arrival, until my departure
Guarantee I put this d-i-c-k in somebody daughter
Aye, I still have my way with the ladies way cross the water
Flew to Paris from Haiti, did some shit that I thought of
It's ironic that the shit that we poppin' makes us psychotic
Then treaten corporate America
That's why they runnin' from me
How could they be so ignorant?
Look what hip-hop done brung us!
It's allowed us to run a business, legitimated our moneys
Got us out of the ghettos and relocated our mommies
I made it all the way here, ain't no way you takin' it from me
So excuse me, Oprah, honey, I'm sorry, really I promise
But niggas, bitches and hoes do exist, I'm just bein' honest
For that am I being punished? Why is you so astonished?
Now, I ain't got a degree, just intelligence in abundance
So you ain't gotta like me, I know billions of folks who love me
You can tell how they yellin' and screamin' and waiting for me
