[Chorus]
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I’m growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you’re never over

[Verse 1]
If Proof could see me now, I know he’d be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there’s somethin' in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it’ll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me, clowns
That means "suicide," homie
You’ll never throw me off of this course, blow me!
Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I’m not just talkin' awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and it’s lonely
On top of the world, when you’re the only one
With the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
'Member that when they get to doggin' you boy, homie
So y’all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
I’m not gonna stop, the saga continues, no stoppin' the force, Obi
I’m moppin' the floors with 'em
I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on droppin' the torch
And it won’t be long 'til this sport is O-V-E-R
Just Blaze and me, we are knockin' on doors
And no, we ain’t pumpkins on Halloween
But we’ll show up on your porch, so be
Careful what you say, there ain’t no punks over here, so follow me
Through the fog like I’m S-N-double-O-P
Let me guide you through the smoke, G
If only I wasn’t travelin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don’t think you understand how much you meant to me

[Chorus]
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I’m growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you’re never over

[Bridge]
And it don’t stop, oh-oooh
And it don’t quit, oh-oooh
And it don’t stop, oh-oooh
And it don’t quit, oh-oooh
And I miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
And homie, I’ll never forget you, nooo

[Verse 2]
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it’ll blow up the mic, it’ll put the "dyna" in mite
Yeah, it’ll make the dopest MC
Wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it’ll jump off the page and spit itself
Guess that the best thing I can do
Right now, Doody, for you is to rep
So I’m gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'ma do it to death
And instead of mournin' your death
I’d rather celebrate your life, elevate to new heights
Step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics
'Cause the way that I’m feelin' tonight
Everything I can just do right
There’s nothin' that I can do wrong
I’m too strong and I’m just too hype
Just finish the rhyme and I bust it
Excuse the corny metaphor, but they’ll never ketchup
To all this energy that I’ve mustard
So God, just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage
I’ve been patiently watchin' this game
Pacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always
Proof, you knew I’d come out of this slump
Rise from these ashes, come right back on their asses
And go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes
I’ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em
Homie, I know I’m never gonna be the same without you
I never woulda came in this game, I’m goin' insane without you
Matter fact, it was just the other night
Had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, "Naw, Doody, you’re not!"
Layin' on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it soon as you said, "think of Hailie", I knew
There wasn’t no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies
And Proof, not many are lucky enough
To have a guardian angel like you, Lord, I’m so thankful
Please don’t think that I don’t feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need
For one more day to get through
So, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you, Doody

[Chorus]
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I’m growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you’re never over

[Bridge]
And it don’t stop, oh-oooh
And it don’t quit, oh-oooh
And it don’t stop, oh-oooh
And it don’t quit, oh-oooh
And I miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
And homie, I’ll never forget you, nooo
