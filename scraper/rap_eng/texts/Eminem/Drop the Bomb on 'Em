[Intro]
Yeah, boy
Them better ring the alarm, boy
Them know what's coming, boy
Buh! Buh-Buh! Haha
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh my God, fuckin' bumbaclot
I'm hard as Kenard, the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire
Tie a whore up with barbed wire, you're nothing but a brah, boy
I'm the real deal, and Charbroiler on the bonfire
And bon voyage, bitch, I'm like Chef Boyardee in this bitch
Send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for you, boy, you think you're Tom Sawyer
Until I pull you out the fuckin' storybook and stomp on ya
Fuckin' fic-titional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction, it's fact, boy, beware, it's real
Them lyrics you wield equal zero to a hero's shield
Mr. Fly by the seat of his pants parasail
Fall, hit the trampoline, bounce, and grab a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothing; no, nada
Like your father fucking your mother

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me)

[Verse 2]
Boy, I'm the Real McCoy, you little boys can't even fill voids
Party's over, kids, kill the noise, here come the killjoys
Me and Dre the steel alloys, the rap Crown Royals
That scalp cowboys, now, how that sound for you?
Yeah, boy, you know we're about to put it down for you
So kick your shoes off in the foyer, have a sound voyage
And sayonara, see you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&R and marinate in some marinara
And have a Coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar
Of whoop-ass on you, that's the last straw you're hopin' to draw
Yeah, you're fresher than most, boy, I'm just doper than all
Boy, I'm that boy, boy, them boys, them no up to par
I just show up, go up to the stage and blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do, boy, I'm a star
Boy, I told you, boy, I'm a soldier boy, I'm Deshaun
Holton in this bitch, I'm the Proof, boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy you, boy, fuck around and blow you to sod
Oh my God, boy, you didn't go there, no, you did not
I got a whole storyboard for you, boy, you're the plot
You're gettin' got, whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology not accepted, boy, Detroit is a rock
We get to beefin', ain't no tellin' at what point it'll stop
All I got to do is point to the spot, when the bomb drops
Boy, does it drop, and when it does, boy, there's a problem

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me)

[Verse 3]
Boy, don't jinx yourself, boy, I'm Micheal Spinks with the belt
Stringer Bell, boy, my name rings bells for itself
I'm sick as hell, boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringin' hell, boy, sing 'em telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy on them sedative meds who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy in a black and red little sweater
Back, better than ever, the cheddar shredder, the grater
The beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later
Givin' haters incubators, think you made a mistake
By saying Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin' place to Beirut in a day
So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit?
Couldn't agree with you more
If you were to say that my fuckin' shit doesn't stink
Shady-fuckin'-Aftermath, boy, the ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fuckin' water 'til we fill up the tank

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me)
