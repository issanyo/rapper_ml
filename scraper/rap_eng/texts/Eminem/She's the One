[Eminem]
Slim Shady, asshole

[Royce]
For any nigga with guns
We got guns too
More heated
Ready to outgun you
It's too late I already outgunned you
You was around
You know the outcome too
Let's play, let me show you what Game is
Heartbreak, I'm showing you what pain is
Please, I'm repping the D homeboy
Where your guns, you stepping to me homeboy
Royce 5'9"'s the name, niggas know
And niggas know, dealing with me niggas know
Ayo toots, how you get here, you wanna ride
I got a five in Southside, you wanna drive
Psych, I ain't got no five, you gold digger
You wanna suga-daddy, go get you an old nigga
I got money, I'm just here to bug you girl
You can't get none, but you know I love you girl

[Refrain]
Yo she the one that wanna ride hot whips, huh
Same one that ain't really got shit, huh
She want her hair done, then get her nails done
Go to Fifth Ave, just to shop for Chanel, huh
She the one who ain't really got shit, huh
That little bitch that really ain't got tits, huh
The fucking slut with her chest enhanced
Titty dances to pay for her breasts implants, huh

[Eminem]
Anybody with knives, we got knives too
More sharper and ready to outslice you
About five dudes deep, who out-size you
And wanna see insides coming outside you
Get me drunk and I'll drink anything you can think
What's up Ms. Bitch
Yo, what's up with the ring, you married
Shit, I'm still mingling, bitch
I just wanted this ring, this the only finger it fit
Wattup with you, you married
Naw, I'm divorced
Of course you are, you little fucking trailer park whore
Trailer, I don't live in no trailer
I live in a mobilization unit, for your information
Bitch, I got a dick, wanna fuck
Hold still, swallow this birth control pill, slut
Before I pump so much cum in your stomach that when I pull out
A year-and-a-half old, potty-trained baby falls out
And I ain't staying to pay no child support, are you playing
Be a man
Bitch what you saying
You tryin to pull some bullshit
While I got one arm free
You want me to make this half-nelson a full

[Refrain]

[Royce]
What's up boo, this is for you and your girlfriend
You Bankhead, up in Detroit we Earl Flynn
Assholes get guns and flashed those
Never ever go to Detroit, we blast those
Hi, my name is
Royce, I'm the king
Gimme money, gimme jewels, everything
Ayo, you with the long hair, is it yours
I guess so, got a reciept paid for
Got anymore lipstick
I'm sick of red
Get a perm, you nappy head, you chicken head
I know you ghetto, I ain't trying to take the ghetto out
Things about you to tell about, mellow out
I'm the one that be making the clubs say what
Getting love, and making the club say what
Some of you cats hate on the low and got sick
Any songs that's not hits, it's not this

[Refrain]
