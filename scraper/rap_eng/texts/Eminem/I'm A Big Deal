I need Christopher Reeves to come and lay his verse
I think he can spit it better on Medicine Ball
First off, I did not even realize the guy died
So I guess them Christopher Reeves jokes ain't gonna fly
Whoa, I'm on a roll, don't get me started
Ellen got pissed at me tried to push me and pussy farted
With such accuracy he aims and he shoots the target
Cupid's arrow and Portia ??? now look, sweetheart it's
The kissin' bandit on a mission to leave, Miss Degeneres
Disenchanted by men now just listen damn it
Miss De Rossi, I need no posse, now single-Hand-ed-ly
Will steal your heart with a kiss
Where should I plant it? Mm-wha! Baby, it's *moi*
And my repertoire's runnin' around in pink panties and leopard bra
And negligar, negligee, you say tomayto I say TOMato
Iâ€™m Tommy Mottola Mariah don`t stop me I`m on a roll, ohh
Y'all know what it is
