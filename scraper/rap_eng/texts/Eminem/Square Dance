[Intro]
People, it feels so good to be back!
Ladies and gentleman
Introducing the new and improved you-know-who

[Verse 1]
Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push, no friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese
I'm a pitbull off his leash, all this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief, and let me just keep shit simple
Can-I-Bitch don't want no beef with Slim, nooo!
Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off?
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
From seance to seance, aw-a-aw-ch-a-aw

[Hook]
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, let your hair down to the track, yeah, kick on back
Boo! The boogie monster of Rap, yeah, the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face and push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right
To say somethin' you might not like
This white hot light that I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no, I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no, I won't leave, won't go nowhere
Do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there!
Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there
Yeah, you laugh 'til your mothafuckin' ass gets drafted
While you're at band camp thinking that crap can't happen
'Til you fuck around, get an Anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in Saran Wrap wrappin'
Open the plastic and then you stand back gaspin'
Fuckin' assassins hi-jackin' Amtraks, crashin'
All this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy
You just a baby gettin' recruited at 18
You're on a plane now, eatin' their food and their baked beans
I'm 28, they gonna take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy?
When I say Hussein, you say Shady
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!

[Hook]
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

[Verse 3]
Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more or suits me beautifully
There's nothin' you can do to me—stab me, shoot at me!
Psychotic, hypnotic product, I got the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada
God, I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la
Oochie walla walla um da dah da dah da, but you gotta gotta
Keep movin', there's more music to make
Keep makin' new shit, produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock and Hennessy, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hungry like a fuckin' younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free
Yeah, buddy, laugh! It's funny: I have the money
To have you killed by somebody who has nothin'
I'm past bluffin', pass the K-Y
Let's get ready for some intense serious ass-fuckin'!

[Hook]
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

[Outro]
Dr. Dre wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas wants to square dance with me
X to the Z wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes wants to square dance with me
Cani-bitch won't square dance with me
Fan-a-bitch won't square dance with me
Canada-bis don't want no parts of me
Dirty Dozen wants to square dance with you
Yeeehawww!
