[Intro: Obie Trice]
Yeah
Ride wit me
Come ride wit Trice, man
I brought my man wit me
Curtis Interscope Jack (ha ha)
Mr. Mathers, my nigga Fif' [Yeah]
Holla at 'em

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie
Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie

[1st Verse: Obie Trice]
They say Obie Trice gone, look at em
Back then I was Mike Jones, who would even look at 'em?
Now I recite songs with icons, see I come from convicts and crumbs
My nigga, listen, his transitions shows his ambitions
Nuttin less then the man getting off his ass and vanishing
Into the world of ass kissing, witness him with Ashton Kutcher
Now they ask for pictures, autographs, signatures
Went from rags to riches to getting ass from bitches
It's hard to grasp the situation at hand
When you used to have to ask for digits
Now they pass em to you like easy fast for tickets
Classic isn't it? Coming from a past with a casket
Dips from beneathe the grass, so you're cremated to ashes
Nigga, created from the Craft, this is past fictious
Fif, tell em how we was when we last wen' visit

[Hook]

[2nd verse: Obie Trice]
And now the spotlight's on Trice
But back when the spot life was Trice
I always kept beside a spot for a mic, despite
Wrongs and rights, I would write after I slung white
To homes on the pipe, I had a notion I would be bi-costal
But being across the ocean is la vida loca
And vada loco, I'm in Janayo
Konecheewa in Tokyo, it's sushi with eel
I got a taste for that pompies chopping up in Brazil
Drinking the finest wines in France on the hill
Now how real is he to come from where we get killed
To having all his dreams fulfilled, look out
I got fantasies of being in Italy where the women be
Offering me the cooch-o, eating on ossobuco
Awesome, I know, so often, we just reach the coffin
And never get to see what the world's offering

[Hook]

[Outro]
{50 Cent}
Yeah
Things change man
You know, get a chance to travel
See the world and you start to look at things a lil different
{Obie Trice}
You ain't bullshitting
Cuz I ain't never thought I'd see it out the hood
Heh, look at a nigga now
