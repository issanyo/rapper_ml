[Hook: Eminem]
Now, I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You're starin' straight into a barrel of hate, terrible fate
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed – wait, Sarah, you're late
Your train left, mascara and eggs smeared on your face
Night's over, goodbye, ho, I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothin' to cry over
Never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib must want me to mess with her mind
Hold up, she mistook me for some high roller
Well, I won't buy her soda unless it's Rock & Rye Cola
(Faygo's cheaper) Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fuckin' chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Tryin' to pull five bucks from me is like tryin' to pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swoll up
I'm on my straight grizzly, so why would I buy you a gay-ass teddy bear? Bitch, you're already bi-polar

[Hook: Eminem]
Now, I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know

Still I ball like there's no tomorrow

[Verse 2: Eminem]
TIP told me on this ho tip, best tip I could give you to hip you
Is never to let these tricks trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love you slut, shit
Dig you, ho? Take a shovel and dig you some dignity, bitch!
Shit, you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone, tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick, it's you, but fuck ‘em, TIP, it's cool
I'm chillin' like a villain
Like the penguin in its fuckin' igloo eating fudgesicles
I’d rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
Before I tie the fuckin' knot I’d tie you in one, bitch
You think this is some Nintendo game, how fuckin' dumb is you?
I’ll give you some lumps before I split some lump sums with you
So here’s a penny for your thoughts
But it won’t buy you a cheeseburger
But a nickel might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, it's official, so blow the whistle, I got a trust issue
There's a bombshell: Scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fuckin' cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was a motherfuckin' stud, slut, this'll
Teach you not to come drunk stumbling my way, for shizzle
I still live like I budget a Gilbert's Lodge check stub, bizzle
So fuck Sizzler! These checkers are bust like a blood blister

Now, I don't really care what you call me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, I guess life is a bitch – ain’t it, TIP?
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I’m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I’m sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't, I’ll stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker; that clock, I'm racin' it
Double timin' it, but I still spit triple the amount of insults
In a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks
To catch on; while you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man, I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it, dog
And they say McDonalds isn’t a restaurant, well, I guess I’m wrong
But if you gonna tell me that A&W ain't the spot
For the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg

[Hook: Eminem]
Now, I don't really care what you call me

[Outro: T.I.]
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said it's over and that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Yeah, goodnight, it’s over
And that's all she wrote
