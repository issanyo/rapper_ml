[Intro: Yelawolf & Eminem]
(In this world, in this world!)
Yeah, aight Marshall, uh
(Well, I'm think you can tell 'em today)
Who am I? (Yelawolf)
(And now you need to bring 'em into this world!)

[Hook]
It’s getting hard to be me
Every where I go, somebody’s looking at me
And If I ever need something, I’mma get it for myself
Cause I’m the only person thinking ‘bout me
It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if you gon’ compare me at all best compare me to myself
Cause I’m the only person fucking with me!

[Verse 1]
In this world of sticks, hicks and chicks with aqua net spray
Shhh-shut up motherfucker don’t disrespect these country ways, yeah!
Alabama, if yeen know, I ain’t hiding a damn thing, I just like to lean low
Yeah, I’m the theme show stereotypical beanpole
Slim, tall, tatted, let me add that I gotta green glow
From all the Mountain Dew that I consume from a mason jar
In a racing car, chase it with a tall ice brew
Let me not leave you confused, what I represent culturally
Trash bag full of freon, I’m huffin’ puffin’ on potpourri
That gummo’s squeaky swingin’ gate in front of that trap house
Trailer park is sewed up and Billy done pulled that ac out

[Hook]
It’s getting hard to be me
Every where I go, somebody’s looking at me
And If I ever need something, I’mma get it for myself
Cause I’m the only person thinking ‘bout me
It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if you gon’ compare me at all best compare me to myself
Cause I’m the only person fucking with me!

[Verse 2]
Wonder what I got inside this Chevrolet Trunk I’m hiding
About ten Bodies on a fishing line with baby clothes on consignment
Came to the Game so broke that I still find one-dollar bills and get a thrill
That’s the kind of shit that leaves my pickle dill'd
Siding on the single-wide got icicle steel, too cold
Got a kerosene heater to heat up the grill, meatloaf?
Daddy’s in jail again for shuffling pills, we know
Man I’ve only come to give you a peep show, (In this world)
I run across the South Like a wild stream, smiling
I’ve seen more colorful mushrooms than a child’s dream on an island
Desolate left behind, cause my state is a state of grime
God said, 1979, go change the minds (In this world)

[Hook]
It’s getting hard to be me
Every where I go, somebody’s looking at me
And If I ever need something, I’mma get it for myself
Cause I’m the only person thinking ‘bout me
It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if you gon’ compare me at all best compare me to myself
Cause I’m the only person fucking with me!

[Verse 3]
Yelawolf, Hi my name is
President O' Bama, I’m so shameless
I’m taking it all, so what am I saying?
I’m the voice of every small town (In this world)
Like a light in the pipe, with a mic
And take flight in this life, I'm a sight
Put a vice-grip lock on my right to fight
Despite the way you may feel about sights and sounds
That I might put down, about prices found on a sack of that white
Heaven is a place in a 7/11, I can never get away from hell
Found hell in the bible-belt, and found love in a 6-pack on the shelf
Went to the seashore to see more, but Leroy didn’t seem sure to me
So I took Leroy to Alabama, he bought the hat and bought the tee
Converted him y’all, I gave him convertible thoughts
When he saw that big buck hangin’ on the wall (Yeah)
I’m off by a millimeter, I’m on by a million light-years and 2 liters
A pint of moonshine, I ride in two-seaters
Take a ride (In this world)

[Hook]
It’s getting hard to be me
Every where I go, somebody’s looking at me
And If I ever need something, I’mma get it for myself
Cause I’m the only person thinking ‘bout me
It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if you gon’ compare me at all best compare me to myself
Cause I’m the only person fucking with me!
