[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Ecstasy in the air
I don't care
Can't tell me nothing
I'm impaired
No worse for wear

[Hook: Rihanna]
'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Can’t you see?
Ain’t it clear
I don't care
Get closer to me
If you dare
I double dare

[Hook: Rihanna]
'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I’m plastered (Dry wall), look me in my (Eyeball)
Do I look high? (No!), I love the way you lie girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come here dear, I'm trya'a' to get closer to you
I'm motioning you to pull over boo
I'm the siren that you hear (hear), I'm the butt police
And I'm looking at your rear, rear, rear
But odds are I'mma end up in the back of a squad car
By the end of tonight, I'm a rock star
Get your wind up, it's attack of the Oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are
'Cause I'm sick of sniffing asphalt
Every thought scarred got my pants off at the crosswalk
In suspenders and I can't feel my lips 'cause

[Hook: Rihanna]
'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going
