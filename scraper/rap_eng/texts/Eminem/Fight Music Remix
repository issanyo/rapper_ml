[Eminem hook]
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass-confusion
And drastic movement of people acting stupid

[Eminem Verse 1]
You 'bout to witness hip-hop in it's most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless, most
Hardest, most honest known artist, chip off the old block, but ol' Doc is, {back}, looks like
Batman brought his own Robin, oh God, Sadam's got his own Laden, with his own private plane, his
Own pilot, set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges, oranges, peach, pears, plums
Syringes, {vnn vnn}, yeah here I come, i'm inches, away from you, dear fear none, hip-hop is in
A state of 911, so

[eminem hook]
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit

[obie trice verse 2]
Niggas, I'm still grinding, (yeah...)
I'm still hearing those sirens
I'm still getting chased by those lights
Only the light's mine and my mic's on
And my time is none because I'm writing more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this buisness
I'm here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this, (for sure...)
And I can't let y'all derail me man
I got young Kobe, homie, you gotta let go of Obie
Cause Obie be back, (ain't goin' nowhere man...)
We got them craps going on
And that yak going on
Soon as a nigga touch down back from tourin'
It's whateva, put that on the chedda man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Ivene time
Chase cheese, rhyme till my voice give out
This is it my nigga, this what we boast about
Now I'm here so shut your motherfuckin mouth

[eminem verse 3]
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that it's sorta unique
Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryin to smoke crack
And go to sleep, I'm strapped
Just knowing any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, it's cockamamie
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeahhh, the whole kitten-kaboodle
I'm just brutal. It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
