12:30 A.M., I was dead asleep
Heard two people screaming outside in the street
It was a guy and his girl, they were having a fight
Still half asleep, middle of the night
Screaming and cussing, that's all you could hear
See the girl's face and it's filled with fear
The screaming gets louder, this has gotta be solved
But I'm saying to myself not to get involved
But it's gotta be done, someone might get hurt
So I grabbed a pair of pants and I throw on a shirt
Heard a shot outside, put my Nike's on
Seen the girl lying half dead on the lawn
I was scared, but in hell of a rage
Went back in the house, loaded up my gauge
Come back outside, girl's still on the ground
I paused for a second and I turned around
Looked up in the dark and I saw a man
Six feet from me, with a gun in his hand
He shot first, but the sucker missed
I was no longer scared, by this time I was pissed
The girl was shot in the head, and I thought she was dead
The whole spot was red from the blood that was shed
I'm still on the ground, the sucker points his gun
I thought I was dead, no chance to run
The girl reaches out from behind the man
Springs herself forward, knocks the gun from his hand
I grab my gauge and ran halfway down the block
Ducked into the alley it was one 'o' clock
He picks his gun back up to continue the chase
Turns around and shoots the girl straight dead in the face
I jumped into a dumpster and I closed the lid
Ain't no motherfucker gonna shoot this kid
He kept on runnin' and he passed me up
I come up from behind him and I said, "What's up?"
The punk turned around and his eyes got bigger
I squeezed the gun tight and I pulled the trigger
Shot him right in the chest, blew him back ten feet
And the sucker laid dead, middle of the street
In the streets of Detroit this happens every day
But fuck with this kid and get blown away
