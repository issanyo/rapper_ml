I wasn't born mean I was pushed to trechary
I walked the streets looking for some puss to fetch me
I like a veggie brain, turn to mush, I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't give me Kim things could get messy
So pass that ass to me, let me squish the left cheek
And pressed against the right one till it's smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods the mc
With the Christopher Reeves beef, we started off on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg, made outta wood? I shouldn't, yes I should
Riding through the hood, I'm chilling with Westwood
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow, I like jello, I'm like hello
To a cute little dyke on the mic, I'm kinda like...
Iron Mike cos I bite earlobes

[Mr.Porter]
Well, I must must say well uh
I'm just not gay well I
I'm must must say um well
See I'm the first to class and the last to leave
I mean I'm the first one to leave out of class, believe
That I'm a mailbox pimp in my heart til' I die
Even after I'm all gone and my ashes fry
Went from ashy guy, class clown this high
To a grown ass man
Runyons ave's the click, D12's the gang
We been spitting; this shit since we was little baby's
Gaga googoo nana, nanny booboo? never
Word to my homie Em, I'm just too too clever
A 45 shot'll leave a motherfuckers face lop-sided
The kick from the barrel make you think I'm cock eyed-ed
When I bust it off in the crow, you start diving
Greg Louganis in over the bar, I ain't lyin'
Hot I ain't equal, it's not defying a soldier
Runyons Ave soldier equals death when it's over
There's nothing colder than niggas than understranded struggle
Fly the street muscle, We been had the hussle
We been had the hussle, We been had the hussle
Fly the street muscle, We been had the hussle

[Eminem]
Me and Westwood blasting off
Jacking off in a pair of Acid Wash, bumping Asher Roth
Crusin Gratiot till I damn nearï»¿ crash the car
Tryna smash a moth on the dash, hit the overpass-went off
Over the bridge, into on coming traffic
Caused a massive 42 car pile up, not a scratch at all
Hocked up holding a axe and saw
Jason mask is off but my face is plastered in Tabasco sauce
Spitting flames, kicking fire out ya ass
Ya little bastard, you can pass it on, I'm battery acid dog
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playing basketball when I'm going through crack withdraw
Dick's so big it's like estlastic
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic
Crossed the path of plastic man, with a drastic force and went spastic
Put my penis on Classic Sports

[Mr. Porter]
