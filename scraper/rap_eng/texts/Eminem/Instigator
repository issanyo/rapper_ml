[Hook: Swifty McVay]
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, take heed to the words I speak
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, 'til it hurts to breathe. Fuck with me

[Verse 1: Kuniva]
I love getting shit started. I instigate a peace talk
Into a beef talk until police need chalk
To chalk you up. Have bitches walking up
Smacking you in your face; screaming that you talk too much
Tell women you said you fucked 'em
Tell the hardest nigga you said you snuck him
Ran his pockets and stuck him
'Til they gather in front of your crib, guns and long clips
Laughing when they shoot at you over the wrong shit
I lock down your block with lies that's so believable
You'll run and grab your shotguns, Glocks and nines
Walking blind; excite fights until they erupt
Instigate my own death 'cause killing you ain't enough

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
I don't give a fuck if we beefing or not: I'll squeeze first
I'mma heat up your spot; I'm a nigga that breathe dirt
On these streets every day, snatching nigga's yay
How you bitches needing work, you can get it from McVay
I'm just spiteful. I tie a ho; a maniacal foul animal
Liable to leave you strapped with your bible
I'm psycho; my bullets won't fly by you
You wanna kill me? You got the right to
Ain't gotta wait 'til night to snipe you: if I don't like you
You getting hit in broad daylight with a white rifle
In front of your window: I'm looking right through
I love when I see a nigga get stuck

[Hook: Swifty McVay]
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, take heed to the words I speak
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, 'til it hurts to breathe. Fuck with me

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
(I'm an instigator) Drama tends to follow me, I know
I probably owe all of my friends apologies
Lie to every bitch just to get her to swallow me
Get a lobotomy; nigga, this one's to my arteries
Guns are a part of me: I pack more than pottery
I ought'a be jailed for depicted mockery
Egg on fights to plot on the niggas that shot at me
I don't twist the truth I just make it Gothic, see
I'm nothing but a liar with a big-ass mouth
Dick and fists big enough to knock your bitch-ass out
Got no reason to tell you the truth
But to be honest with you, I rap with him but I don't like Proof

[Verse 4: Proof]
Nigga, fuck you. Me and Swift got plans to jump you
Type of nigga to shake your hand and stomp you
(I'm an instigator) Convince a tenth-grader
To run up inside his classroom and leave the kids [sprayed up]
Bitch, straight-up. This is the season
For squeezing off triggers on niggas for no reason
Either jump or quit running your mouth
Pull a gun out, better use it 'til the bullets run out

[Hook: Swifty McVay]
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, take heed to the words I speak
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, 'til it hurts to breathe. Fuck with me

[Verse 5: Swifty McVay]
I throw a brick at your crib, have you standing on the porch Screaming "Look what you did!" I ain't feeling no remorse
Nigga, just pick up the kids. Swift got first dibs
With these cherry-hot slugs that'll barbecue your ribs
I'm preparing deathbeds. Quick to bust lead
While I'm staring at the Feds, tearing off they legs
Once you drop dead, they'll be swearing it's a plague
I'm sicker than a coke Rastafarian with dreads
You get shanked if you move; ditched with no clues
Dopest shit on yo' tape was yo' skits and interludes
And once I finish you, they wouldn't put it in the news
I'm nuts, so you hoes ain't got the guts to interview

[Hook: Swifty McVay]
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, take heed to the words I speak
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, 'til it hurts to breathe. Fuck with me

I'm an instigator

I'm an instigator
I'm an instigator
I'm an instigator
I'm an instigator
I'm an instigator
