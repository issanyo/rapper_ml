[Verse: Eminem]
You know it's devil's night
The way that I smash the face of a punk in
Mask of Jason is a fashion statement since Drunken
Master tapes been a basket case
And if that's the case, then I'm dunkin'
Fascination with masturbation and humpin'
Lacerations and masking tape
And I'm bumpin' some Masta Ace
Roll up posin' as pastor Mase at a lunchin'
See Andrea Yates, grab her face, then I'm punchin'
Crack her fuckin' skull with an antique vase, kill her husband
To the back of the station wagon
She's dragged and placed in the trunk and
Now I'm wanted for kidnappin', rape, and abduction
Spread her legs like Land O'Lakes that I'm cuttin'
'Til every fuckin' limb's either amputated or punctured
Decapitated Christina Applegate and I rap like I'm agitated
No chill, but I'm half sedated
A functioning addict — wait, I'm in London?
Brains underwear? A pantywaist, classic case of disfunction
Aggravated assault, it was rap related, you activated a gunman
This game's over-saturated with junk and
You punks couldn't get a hit from a database with a thumbprint
Razors and matches, path is laid for destruction
Put Jason Mraz's face in his ass
Then I'm snatchin' Anne Hathaway
She scratchin' like Jam Master Jay on the one's and
Two's, I slash away, then I'm dumpin'
Her ass in a Lake Placid for alligators
After I use the fuckin' tire thumper to bash her brains in for nothin'
The murder weapons, I stash 'em away on Runyon
Man, the kind of balls that it has to take and the gumption
Lack of class displayed, but such a vast array in abundance
Of sad disgraceful and bad distasteful redundance
And, bitch, I'm hung like candy canes if you're wonderin'
Balls come at you like batting cages
I'm raw like Big Daddy Kane is, I'm comin'
Like I'm ejaculatin' and nuttin'
Come catch the clap like you're patty-cakin', lil' dumplin'
Or brace yourself like a cast and be the last to make an assumption
I'm back like I'm in the bathroom takin' a dump and
It's back in the day or somethin'
I'll shit on you, Devil's Night — how's that for a introduction?
