I wasn't born mean I was pushed to treachery
I walked the streets looking for some puss to fetch me
I like a veggie brain, turn to mush, I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't give me Kim things could get messy
So pass that ass to me, let me squish the left cheek
And pressed against the right one till it's smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods the MC
With the Christopher Reeves beef, we started off on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg, made outta wood? I shouldn't, yes I should
Riding through the hood, I'm chilling with Westwood
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow, I like jello, I'm like hello
To a cute little dike on the mic, I'm kinda like
Iron Mike cos I bite earlobes

Me and Westwood blasting off
Jacking off in a pair of Acid Wash, bumping Asher Roth
Crusin Gratiot till I damn nearï»¿ crash the car
Tryna smash a moth on the dash, hit the overpass-went off
Over the bridge, into on coming traffic
Caused a massive 42 car pile up, not a scratch at all
Hocked up holding a axe and saw
Jason mask is off but my face is plastered in Tabasco sauce
Spitting flames, kicking fire out ya ass
Ya little bastard, you can pass it on, I'm battery acid dog
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playing basketball when I'm going through crack withdraw
Dick's so big it's like elastic
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic
Crossed the path of plastic man, with a drastic force and went spastic
Put my penis on Classic Sports
