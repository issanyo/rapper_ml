[Intro]
Yo yo yo yo yo (this is)
This is my motherfucking anthem (hip hop)
To hip hop music (anthem)
Cause I'mma keep doing hip hop music
Until the day that I die (aight bitch)

[Verse 1]
Yo I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and Ouija boards
Lighting candles camping out at haunted beach resorts
I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence
Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks
Holding a rifle, with a life full of drama like 2Pac's
Jumping off roof tops drunk after I do shots
Landing in someone's backyard getting chewed up by two rots
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash coming out the blue like nude cops
I use to sell pizzas, now I got twelve visas
So tell Jesus that I'mma quit sinning when hell freezes

[Hook]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probably why my nights are getting colder and my days seem shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growing older
I'll be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I'll be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and I keep growing older
I'll be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over

[Verse 2]
Yo I use to be too heavy in that cruising Gratiot crap
I think I fucked my head up listening to acid rap
I go to parties bumping Nasty Nas's new song
And smoke pot till I get high and stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced ain't it, it tastes tainted
The whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted
Spaced out like Sci-Fi TV, "Fuck ICP, buy my CD!"
That's what I'm screaming while I'm handing out promo tapes of my debut
Telling bitches let me eat your pussy while I shave you
Ain't no shame in my game I turn the party out
Making everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth

[Hook]

Uh, uh uh uh uh
Ah ah ah ah
Uh uh uh uh
Ah ah ah ah
Uh uh uh uh (Dr. Dre)
Ah ah ah ah (Slim Shady) (Outsidaz)
