Want some water?
No, I think I'm okay
Rainshine

I don't care how sick you say it's gonna get
My big ass bubble has not busted yet
Because I feel
I feel fine, I feel fine
Yes I feel
I feel fine, I feel fine
Yes I feel, I feel fine, I feel fine
Yes I feel, I feel fine

New time again, dis a new time again
For de time now, de dodge a man him come through and then
Me no want no war, me say between no man
'Cause this hear time dodge a no work for satan
Lord have mercy
Lord have his mercy

You know what?
I've got nothing to complain about
My breath is bad
But my beer is stout
So take my hand and let us jump about
'Cause we got nothing to complain about
The sky is grey
I think it's gonna rain
But that's okay
'Cause hell, I like the rain
So join me here in this here refrain
And shut your shit
And don't complain
What?
'Cause we got nothing to complain about
And you got nothing to complain about
So c'mon
It ain't that difficult to figure out
That we've got nothing to complain about
So c'mon

A man a shot upon him, life through the dark
When you check it out, it's a natural fact
Jah jah have good judgement when you do all you want
And if...

You can speak of babylon while you're around me
'Cause every single little thing I see astounds me
Rainshine...

Inna this time, me no fight 'gainst no man
Me no want no man come try to test dodge
'Cause when you check it out and go upon one mission
And God and the Father and me inspiration
Me test upon a mission and a one-way plan
Me no want no man try disrespect me fashion
'Cause when you check it out and put inspiration
And that is how a you go reach Mount Zion

I feel magical, mystical, motherful, logistical

Lord have his mercy

Magical, mystical, motherful, logistical
Magical, mystical
Magical
Magical, mystical

Look around X3
On the ground X2
There's a finger on my blister
