[Verse One: Method Man]
Niggas is like "Oh my God not you!"
Yes I'm in the flesh like hollow heads through your vest
No contest, M.E.-Eth Man's obsessed
With sex, drugs and rock and roll, new Tecs and calicos
Word has it we move mathematic on rappers
Who don't add up, you get broke, battered and slapped up
8 million stories in the nekkid call yo man Method
Straight guerrilla iller nigga kill a murder record
My verbal shooter does it to ya
The 16-bar Ruger, busting yo funky dope maneuvers
But I'm not ya Super Lover Cee, I'm the Super Sperm
Splash it on your skin rub it in like it's Lubriderm
10 out of 10 I'll be the, men of all men I mean the
Creme de la creme a schemer, sipping on 'Gnac and Zima
The Professional 2 (DJ Clue!)
Now that Bush is president nigga we all through

[Verse Two: Eminem]
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
Why I keep on ducking under the bed when I hear thunder
Cause I ain't crazy, I say shit that's crazy to crazy people
To make 'em believe I'm crazy so they can relate to me
And maybe believe in Shady so they can be evil baby
I like that! I'm only as crazy as people made me
Believe me, they'd be just as many mutherfucking murderers
And heroin users without Marilyn's music
But I figure I make my music I don't care if you use it
To murder somebody, I just wanna be there when you do it
Now the parents are suing cause little Darren is screwing
Karen and Susan cause I told him to do it on Clue's new shit
Now it's all ruined, the whole world is fucked up
Cause of me? Two 12-year old girls is knocked up
My attitude's 'fuck it' like Pac's was at one point
Wanna come join? Pick up a Glock and just point
Now everybody's killing everybody and everybody's bloody
And I'm just laughing like it's funny
Cause I don't really give a shit about no-motherfucking-body
I'm so motherfucking nutty, I don't give a fuck about nothing

[Verse Three: Royce da 5'9"]
My wrist is water and freezer mix
This is Audio Jesus, the repent shit gets big
Keep a sharp-like knife in a pop device
So "Duro you gotta let it bump!", I came from a hard knock life
They say this kid be rude like this can't be true
I'll suck my own dick like if I had a rib removed
Vampire, sun go down, I'm still wilding
Bullets travel through the air in the night like Phil Collins
Rock City baby, knife through your throat 'til you're broke
Rise from the underground like sewer smoke
It's all shifty, I got all of my dogs with me
And they all rich, and still all of their palms itchy
We'll pump, rumble over birds jungle urge
Walking like we talking drunk while we stumble over words
Clue, Duro, Slim, Meth
Five, Nine, hold up, breath

[Method Man]
It's just, Mr. Meth and DJ Clue
I ain't crazy, I just do what the beats say do

[Eminem]
It's just, Slim Shady and DJ Clue
I ain't evil, I just do what the beats say do

[Royce]
Uhh, uhh, Royce Five-Nine and DJ Clue
I ain't bad, I just do what the beats say do

[DJ Clue]
DJ Clue, Desert Storm
Come on man
