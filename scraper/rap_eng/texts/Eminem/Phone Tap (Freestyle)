I'm ice grilling you, staring you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, cause Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac with a cranium packed full of more uranium
Than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spasmodic
Strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in a hospital in critical condition
I flat lined, jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai-weed
Looking Chinese with my knee's, stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope god forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killing my girlfriends
