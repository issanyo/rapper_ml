[Hook: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah yo, let's pretend like it's '98
Like I'm eatin' lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A (A-Town)
Hoping for a record deal to ignore my pain
Yeah, now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane
Okay, and everybody know my name (Bob)
And everywhere I go people want to hear me sang
Oh yeah, and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring, and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination

[Hook: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Okay, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes
Like I never used to run away into the blackness
Now, let's pretend like it was all good
Like I didn't live staring in the notebook
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should
But I ain't have neighbors, that's why they call it hood
Yo, now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or A.K.A. Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre (3000)
Before I ever got on MySpace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend, and make wishes out of airplanes

[Hook: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

[Bridge: B.o.B. & Eminem]
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone, they're just memories
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind
"Marshall you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game
There ain't no way that you'll win"
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch
"You won't amount to shit, quit daydreaming kid
You need to get your cranium checked
You're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic"
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the Rap Olympics
Slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Lainey
These food stamps and this WIC shit
Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even here, he pretends that-

[Hook: Hayley Williams]
Airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars....
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

[Cr7z]
Nehmen wir an, ich hätte mich für Hip-Hop niemals entschieden:
Hätte niemals auch nur eines meiner Lieder geschrieben
Was wäre dann?
Würde ich studieren statt meine Zeit in Musik investieren
Peanuts verdienen, und Doppelschichten an Fließbändern schieben?
Programmier ich Videospiele oder würd ich Ken-Jitsu praktizieren bis zum zehnten Dan?
Ich nehme an, ich wäre alles in allem wohl besser dran
Doch nichts davon läge mir in der Wiege
Ich bin gespannt auf die Zukunft
Auf jeden Beat den ich kriege
Bastel ich wieder ein Brett
Für diese Rapper-Szene und vielleicht zieh ich weg
Weg von dem Beef mit den Hiesigen MC's
Die ich schon überbiete seitdem ich 16 bin
Cr7z wird entdeckt -
Und released über BMG, an jedem Track verdien ich
Rappe auf riesigen Jams, werde zur Raplegende
Und wenns mein Ziel ist, dann:
BANG! - Besiegel das Feature mit B.o.B. Hayley & Eminem
Das wär perfekt:
Ich könn' meiner Familie was bieten
Sähe nicht mehr diesen Verlierer im Spiegel
Ich weiß: Ich bin nicht Realistisch genug
Aber mir geht es so gut
Wenn ich davon träume wie's wäre -
Und gehe friedlich mit nem' Lächeln zu Bett
Meine Fantasie lässt mich fliegen
An die Plätze für die mein Herz schlägt
Ich werde sehen, wie's in den Sternen steht
Bis dahin spazier ich neben der Landebahn
Heb die Hand an die Stirn wenn ich wieder einen sehe und denk mir:
