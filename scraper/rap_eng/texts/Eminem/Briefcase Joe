[Intro: Briefcase Joe]
Yeah this is going out
To those two yerks
From Junior High School
Who called me Briefcase Joe
Guess what?
Now It's come to past that
It's turned out to be a good thing for me

[Verse 1: Briefcase Joe]
(Yeah, tell 'em)
Yo here I go
They call me Briefcase Joe
I write my lyrics down
For a keepsake, yo
On the microphone
Here's the beats they go
You could be the rapper
I'm the DJ, yo
My lyrics just erupt like a volcano
Everywhere I walk
When I talk they know
I flippin' it, dippin' it
Trippin' it, rippin' it
Hit 'em with venom in 'em
I gave them an enema
Then hit 'em up
Right in front of the cinema
Skin them alive
{Rocking the party}
As soon as the women arrive
Then Imma drive a stake in their heart (yeah)
And squirt (yeah)
Lemon in their eyes
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Hook: Eminem]
Chicka, Chicka, Chicka, Chicka
Briefcase Joe
They called him, they called him
They called him  Briefcase Joe
Chicka, Chicka
His name is
His name is Briefcase Joe
He don't carry that briefcase to the school no more
Chicka

[Verse 2: Briefcase Joe]
My testicles
Are vegetables
They're going to Mexico
They're on a jet-jetroll, yo

[Hook: Eminem]
