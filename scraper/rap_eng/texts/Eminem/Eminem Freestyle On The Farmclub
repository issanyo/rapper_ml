[Verse 1]
It's the mothafuckin' Farm Club
This little girl 'bout to get a arm rub
Who wanna see me on this mothafuckin' fiction board
Who wanna see me on a mothafuckin' diction lore
And I'll be kicking source to mothafuckin' camera looking right in it
I can kick twenty dope rhymes in one minute
And y'all don't understand cause my rhymes are Infinite

[Refrain]
What's the Farm Club?
It's the mothafuckin' *chika-chika* Farm Club
It's the mothafuckin' *chika-chika* Farm Club

[Verse 2]
Is this shit there wasn't be bleeped out?
I don't know but I feel it is and it's like *eeh-eh*
And I will kicking rhyme until it stops to *eeh-eh*

[Outro]
What? Wha-what? It's the Farm Club?
What? Wha-what? Wha-what? It's the Farm Club?
