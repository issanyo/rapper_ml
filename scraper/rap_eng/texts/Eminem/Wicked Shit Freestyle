Eminem:
... grab the mic and I am kickin 'em
While I'm getting wicked with the wicked shit
About to be kicking it with ridiculous skits
When I be flipping 'em
Taking mic's and ripping them

I stab motherfuckers bad

It doesn't matter who's fatter
Cause if I had a gun, then I would add a whole to your bladder
Kicking the mad fuckin' shit and I ?
Motherfuckers are scared of
In all kind of ways when I rewind blind ...
