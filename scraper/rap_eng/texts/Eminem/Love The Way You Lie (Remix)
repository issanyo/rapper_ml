[Verse 1]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glasses shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you always win
Even when I'm right
Cos you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles are what keeps me satisfied

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Bridge]
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Verse 3 (Eminem)]
This morning
You wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup, as we lay in the wake of destruction
Shh! Hush, baby
Speak softly
Tell me how awfully sorry you are that you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room, and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you I'm nothing
I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me
In the aftermath of the destructive path that we're on
Two psychopaths, but we know that no matter how many knives that we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs cuz we're that lucky
Together we move mountains
Let not make mountains out of mole hills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'
I may have hit you three times
I'm startin' to lose count
But together we'll live forever
We found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refuse counsellin'
Our house is too huge
If you move out I'll burn all two thousand square feet of it to the ground
Ain't shit you can do about it
Cuz with you I'm in my fuckin' mind
Without you I'm out it

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
