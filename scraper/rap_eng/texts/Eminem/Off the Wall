[Post-Hook: Eminem]
No matter what people say
I'm gon' keep rapping this way
No matter what you may think
I'mma keep doing my thing

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm the worst thing since fat bald men
Decided to write songs to teach Mouseketeers to sing
I stick Britney Spears in a room full of mirrors
So she gets fifty years of bad luck
Causing terror to Christina Aguilera
When I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara
Beware of this rap terrorist with a therapist
With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled in his pants
Got a habit of holding Tylenol in his hands
Till it melts in his fucking palms and dissolves in his glands
(So who is it?) The fool who visit the playground
With two biscuits to lay down the school district
Get pistol-whipped with a Mossberg
With a pistol grip, and fed pitbull shits
Sniff glue sticks like I give two shits
If I get too rich, I just get sued

[Verse 2: Redman]
Yo, I leave wit no injure, after I blow four in ya
One handstand on top of yo ninja
Crash it, Doc stir the madness
Till y'all outta work like Tony Atlas
Walking, cans in the laundry basket
America's most, with the army after us
Fuck flossing, we take what's yours
Unload fifteen like an ace and four
I'm outta work, but Doc laid them off
(Shit, the power's out) The tape is off!
Yo, you targeted from arsonists
Papermate pens filled wit arsenic
I got hoes that don't know what Prada is
Doc could shape up, touch your barber miss
Fade you with a bloody blade
I turn rap camps into Crystal Lake
Fuck bitches face is what I'mma do
Cause that's what white boy Tano do

[Hook: Eminem & Redman]
So how's everybody doin' tonight?
Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and scream in a fight
Cause uh, we getting down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if y'all don't wanna bump to this (off the wall)
So how's everybody feelin' tonight?
Hope you in that mood to get rude and ill in a fight
Cause uh, we getting down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if you don't wanna bump (off the wall)

[Post-Hook: Eminem]
No matter what people say
I'm gon' keep rapping this way
No matter what you may think
I'mma keep doing my thing

[Verse 3: Redman]
Yo, you could buy Jaz spitting, hospital, son admit it
Rip your lips off, kiss my ass with it
Slap bitches, got Marshall Math's (printing)
Weed, X, and the acid tabs did it
I'm "What's Happening," with no re-run
Doc. Rob De Niro when the Heat come
My barrel hang out the Camaro
Aimed at the nose of them hoes, it's hard to breathe from
Flash the gat, your town, bogarting
Your wallet, your chain the main target
Beef is like cold engine: don't start it
Bust in the air and hit a airplane pilot
We clowned you, rap surround sounds around you
From ten speed and brown shoe
Doc and Eminem, cock the M&M
Blood flows with 2Pacalypse and them

[Verse 4: Eminem]
It's like, Funk Doctor meets the punk rocker
Got the drugs stocked inside the lunch box (uhh)
Pop junk like I just got jumped
Popped the trunk and pulled out the shotgun pump
Knock wood, it's all good; thank God for vodka
Cause wit my luck, I'll probably get shot by a stalker
Probably got a fanatic waiting upstairs in the attic
With a automatic calling me up there
My man, Stan, with a gat in his hand
Staking my house out in a tan, tinted sedan
Pull your mouth out till you can't finish a damn
Ham sandwich, or your can spinach and Spam
Till you gotta sip through a straw, shoplift through the mall
Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall
Hey Ma... maybe I'll give you a call
Psyche! You fucking bitch, suck a dick and two balls!
I'm giving you all my job descrip', which is
To piss bitches and priests off with this (...need Jesus!)
Pop more pills till police officers
Arrive at the scene and pull me off of Kim
Teeth off my dick, hands off my balls
But y'all can kiss my ass, pants off and all!
Cause I'm so goddamn off the wall
I might as well just be a painting smashed on the floor

[Hook: Redman & Eminem]
So how's everybody feelin' tonight?
Hope you in that mood to get rude and ill in a fight
Cause uh, we getting down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if you don't wanna fuck to this (off the wall)
So how's everybody doin' tonight?
Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and screw in a fight
Cause uh, we getting down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if y'all don't wanna bump to this (off the wall)

[Outro: Eminem]
No matter what people say

No matter... oh
