[Eminem]
Arsonist, blocking the fire hose where the nozzle is
Go to hospitals, steal the blood that tests positive
Take it home, pour it in a cup, and drink lots of it
Tryin' on your mothers clothes trying to get these bras to fit
When she comes home, I'm waiting in the closet with aï»¿ knife
Hiding so quiet you'll probably hear the faucet drip
All my life I've been a foster kid
So if I die an early death suicides goin' be the cause of it

[Royce]
Who hard? yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil
Intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist
Intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse
Then one get at you, dash you in the back of a Chevrolet
Spittin shit at you faster than your eardrum could ever play

[Hook]
Cause this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal
Above the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either (shit, me neither)

(Verse 2)

[Eminem]
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
Cuz I can't find a decent vain

[Royce]
The disaster wit dreads
I'm Bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
To kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
Cause I serve any stranger wit money
I fade a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches
I got alot of ego; I got knowledge leaking out of my cerebral now that I got people locked (and rock evil?)
While still on the beat, I hit you in your ribs so hard your finger tips will touch to the floor, while your still on your feet
I'm blazin MC's, at the same time amazin MC's
Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me
Destroying the track, un-employing the whack, exploring the facts
While my man Eminem is withdrawing from crack

(Crying)

(Eminems Verse)
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me?
I'm the one who burned your house down
Well I'm out now, and this time I'm comin back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon leave you a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave
I'mma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe
