Twisty808 - Spaz ft Eminem

[Chorus: Twisty] (2x)
All we wanna do is spaz.. spaz.. spaz
The industry we'll smash
Till it crash.. crash.. crash

[Verse: Twisty]
Twisty on the track
Range spaztic
Shorty rollin hard
Straight aztec
Geared up
With the spears up
Clashin
Cross the line
Toss thy hide
On the Canvas
Smashin competition
Unmatched man
No remorse for the cats
We catch nappin
Rattle off on the boss
I damage
Tattle off
Leave you lost
In a trash bag
Underground we rep
No hashtag
Industry catch strep
When we blast em
Savages reek havoc laughin
Catch a breath for a sec
Don't panic
Blackballed
So the trap calls
Crossed off
Like a scratch card
Speedin
To the crash course
We street
While you half fourths
I believe I put em under seige
Wolverine I berserk a beat
Bathory
When I make em bleed
Shang Tsung
When they soul retreat
I'm the ghost
When they say retreat
No more coastin
I will kill the peak
Rollin foes like I'm Tecca neen
Seal they casket let them scream defeat

[Chorus: Twisty] (2x)
All we wanna do is spaz.. spaz.. spaz
The industry we'll smash
Till it crash.. crash.. crash

[Verse: Eminem]
Once I get on two hits of X
My disc slips and disconnects
Till I walk around this bitch
With a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch
Who disrespects (I shit on you)
Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts five more zany acting maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
And spilling liters of blood like swimming pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too
A lot of people say misogynistic which is true
I don't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by as I start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
It's they who egged me and say they can take me
It's they who legs I brake and make achy
It's they who mistake me and make me so ANGRY!
(I'll shit on you!) I'll spit on you
Start pissing and do the opposite on you
You weren't listening, I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon bleu and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy

[Chorus: Twisty] (4x)
All we wanna do is spaz.. spaz.. spaz
The industry we'll smash
Till it crash.. crash.. crash
