[Intro]
The Incredible Hulk-
And he brought me- He brought [?]
You- you gotta- [?]
And he- he [?]ed a bot so he could [?] me around and drive
Man, you don't even know what time it is
I saw this mad pimp daddy walkin' down the street, with incredible, [?], Bellbottom, tight, purple pants
I'm talkin' about tight-

[Hook]
Tight, pimp, saga, purple pants
Tight, pimp, saga, purple pants

[Verse 1]
Well let me tell you about these purple pants that he was wearing
They sagged down his feet and they kept on dragging
Down on the ground when he walked with them
It looked like bellbottoms, and they were my friend
They were bellbottoms, purple pants
Worn by a pimp and he did that dance
Had [fish for?] high heels and he strutted [?] tall
Walked like a pimp and he did this thing, we call
Rhymin', He rhymed all the time
But not in a rap, he liked to sing all the time
He liked to sing about bitches
Strawberry alarm clocks and ditches
That dog's dig
Just like my dog Spot, you know he's a bitch
He tried to fuck me, I said no
He fucked the beat up, and I'm on the go

[Hook]
Purple, pimp, saga, err, pants
Purple, pimp, saga, bellbottom pants

[Verse 2]
Purple, pimp, saga, bellbottom pants
Worn by Incredible Hulk
The punk who thinks he's bad
Really cause he knows that he's really sad
He came up in my face with a big green grin
I said, "Homeboy, don't you think I'm gonna spin
On my head, like a breakdancer?"
I said, "No,"
I punched him in the jaw, and I broke his [?]
It's called spooky
Spooky
And the chorus will go just like this
Yo homeboy don't ever diss cause he's a-

[Hook]
Purple, pimp, saga, bellbottom pants
Purple, pimp, saga, bellbottom pants
And that's the end
