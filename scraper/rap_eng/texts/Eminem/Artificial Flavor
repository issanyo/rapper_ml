[Verse 1: Proof]
Who started the mimic, whack
The gimmick, whack
Jimmy cracked corn [?]
Give ‘em smacks
Perhaps the copycats
Had no better turns
[?]
Lost his sense of balance
The lame brain put more into the game
[?] fame
And I’ll drop something proper
By slammin’ the hammer down like Judge Wapner
And after this [?] face me
Throwing’ the blows heavy
So if you’re Chevy, don’t chase me
Where’s your motivation
Taking up your spare time
[?] air time
Don’t you think you know the station
So why [?]
[?]
Grab a parachute to rock bottom
Let the real rappers [?]
Here comes the main course

[Verse 2: Chaos Kid]
Hurah, hurah, ha, haha, ha
Good God [?] bye, bye, bye
[?]
[?] stuff that’ll make you stop and drop
[?] ‘Cause you haven’t [?] before
It’s probably because I have a different kind of outlook
That creates a totally different type of output
So stay put you crook and save the book
Are we going become [?]
And so many rappers are giving credit [?] go
But there’ll be none of that repetition here
[?] uncle [?] mission clear
At the dinner [?] run over [?] past you
You better seek a savior
Alert to run fast, yeah
Basement Productions is definitely in the house
Now my fellow figures
Let’s go to the question
Where, oh, where has our hip-hop gone?
[?] we got a yellowish [?]
We got to work together to end the [?]
To send the [?] back out

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Not a happy camper
‘Cause somebody put a damper
On my spirit, tamper
Now I’m [hamper?] with [interference?]
We fell asleep and let the drawbridge unguarded
Now we’re being bombarded by garbage
So I seriously think your [?] really needs a good boost
‘Cause you got me so bored I feel like a piece of wood
So I’mma break it to you gently
It doesn’t make you a rapper ‘cause [?]
Oh no
This kind of stuff takes practice
You can’t lift weights for first time in your life and expect to be Atlas
So I really recommend you find yourself a new outlet
‘Cause you’re wearing out your welcome like an outfit
So the real ones I keep a close relationship
I no longer have to be in association with
The rappers that are rappin’ [?] and rhyming like a [principle?] [?]
‘Cause this is the type of stuff that’s been bumpin’ us off the schedule

[Verse 4: Chaos Kid and Eminem]
Spoken like a [?]
[?]
No charging at the door we charge the margin for
No tellin’ 'em [?] makin’ my ear drums numb
While they’re making a career from
Judy has a big booty
Stutterin’ like Porky Pig
Rapping the [?] booty
You can’t blame it on one and say he did it
‘Cause the pop was flat before you put the ice in it
And now it’s time to break out the gats and throw it up in your face until you shut your [?] ass
So stop getting dumb and play smart
Grow a hundred legs like a centipede
[?] K-Mart
[?]
Before you go take a piece of my heart
