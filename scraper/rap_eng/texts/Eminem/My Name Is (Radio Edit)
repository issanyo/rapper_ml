Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?

Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?

[Intro]
Excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class for one second?

[Verse 1]
Hi, kids! Do you like Primus? (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Wanna see me stick 9 inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try *** and get messed up worse than my life is?
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said "Slim Shady, you a ***head!"
Uh-uh! "So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!"
Well, since age twelve I felt like a caged elf
Who stayed to himself in one space, chasing his tail
Got ticked off and ripped Pamela Lee's lips off
Kissed 'em and said "I ain't know silicone was supposed to be this soft!"
I'm about to pass out and crash, and fall in the grass
Faster than the fat man who sat down too fast
Come here, lady! "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!"
I don't give a damn, Dre sent me to tick the world off

[Verse 2]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Damn)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler, and told him to change the grade on the paper (Now!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Served the bartender, then walked out with the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more *** than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing *** and name it after her (Here mom!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it: "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!"

[Hook]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady

[Verse 3]
Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of Kool-Aid, dare me to drive? (Go ahead!)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops!)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll *** anything that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no ***!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and tap myself in the head
I'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Ask him if he bought a porno mag to see my ad
