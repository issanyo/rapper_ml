Man, I got everything candy-painted, candy-painted tint, it's so dark
I'd be lying if I said I ain't hit at least nine of my friends
Plus, I got so much candy paint in my rims
Paint be flyin' off my car be candy paintin' the neighborhood kids
I got that whole block lookin' like it's Candyland
Ask about me, man, they be like, there go the candy man
I park the car in the garage and go in and
Come back the next mornin', the rims are still spinnin'
Hit the doors on that Phantom, man, that shit looks like the Batmobile
Thirty-two inch rims, shit, I ain't even got no wheels
Custom-fitted, custom-kitted wood grain
Custom everything, what's that on the seat, custom mustard stain

Get out the car, they be like, ah, there go them superstars
Hit every single store, flash a fuckin' wad of cash

Don't think I won't beat a bitch, I'll kick a six-year-old in the ribs
You fuckin' retard, I'll have you suckin' farts out my seat
I'll teach you not to know how to control your bowels when you eat
What the fuck do you think that colostomy bag is for, looks?
I ain't waste nine bullets on you for you to not sing no hooks

[Outro]
Tracy, I joined this class cuz I thought I’d be cooking with a partner
But she’s never here, and I don’t get twice the credit for all the work

I didn't invent odd numbers Seth

I know, but I’m over here in my unit, every day, cooking my terrible-tasting food, and then I gotta look over at Evan, I mean look at him, it looks like the most fun I’ve ever seen in my entire life. And, I’m just saying, I wash and dry, I’m like a single mother. And, no offense but, everyone takes this class to get an A and it’s bullshit, but uh no offense, I’m just saying. And I’m not putting down your profession, but when am I gonna need to cook tiramisu? Am I gonna be a chef? No. There’s 3 weeks left in school, give me a freaking break, sorry for cursing. OH MY GOD that’s like the coolest fucking story I’ve ever heard in my life, it’s insane. Can you tell us again? Do you have time? Tracy, Tracy, can you hear me? I’m in the car right now. Listen, I am McLovin, yeah. McLovin in the house! McLovin in the house! Yeah
