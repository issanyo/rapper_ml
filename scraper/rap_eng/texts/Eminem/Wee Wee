Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

[Verse 1]
Got a dick as big as a banana
I try to control it but I guess I can't
It shoots off like an AK-clip banana
You better watch out, Hannah Montana
Man, what's the matter, have you no manners?
No you know the girl from Juno's address
Yeah, I'ma probably go to jail for that
Now I got the cops on my tail for that
Run up on your car with a stale banana
In your tail pipe, can't believe you fell for that
It could've been a molotov cocktail for that
Wait a minute man, what the hell was that?
I heard a noise, where you going? What are you, bananas?
You can't go back there, stupid ass
I just seen a woman in a Freddy Kruger mask
Who the fuck are you? Superman?
All you have is a little stupid can
Of whipped cream, what the hell you gonna do with that?
I'ma put it on my wee-wee, oh good answer
Super bonanza extravaganza
Man go ahead, what you waiting for?
You better get them clothes off, baby boy
Come on let's go, we're gonna make a porn
Ready, set, go hit play, record

[Hook]
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

[Verse 2]
Are you ready? You better hold the camera steady
She's probably back there with a damn machete
She's probably gonna eat you like canned spaghetti
She's probably gonna kill you, still wanna check, see
Have a little quick look, go on sick prick
She's probably six foot tall like Big Foot
The hell with that, we probably should run
Don't dare look back, we probably, probably
Probably, there probably was a problem
At the post office or something
But you probably didn't know that, did you?
Now what you gonna do when she gets you?
I ain't going with you, forget you
Quit tryna hold my hand, mister
Pretend she's your little sister, little sister
Might as well take the whipped cream with you
And when you see her, make sure you get a picture
We could try to make another Blair Witch movie
A beastiality porno with smoothies

[Hook]
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

[Verse 3]
It's eerie, but here comes Zack and Miri
Beauty and the Beast, his back is hairy
But she don't care, they're attractive, very
Very sexually active, very
No, Zack, don't go back in there
It's too late now, she's grabbin' hair
He screams, bloody Mary, grabs a mirror
But stop just ain't in her vocabulary
Get off me, please, get off me, stop
Balling back at a coffee shop
They go non-stop, she says go
He says no, she says oh
Back and forth, they scream and shout
Yeah, boy, let them demons out
It's the kind of nightmare you dream about
Uh-oh, now the whipped cream is out
I get sick thoughts, sick, sick, thoughts
Things you could do with your lipstick gloss
Put it on my dick 'til the tip looks orange
Bitch, keep goin', bitch, keep goin'

[Hook]
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

[Outro]
