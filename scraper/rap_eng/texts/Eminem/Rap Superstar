(Eminem Speaking)
Most people don't see how much work is really involved
In this rap shit
I didn't know it
I didn't see it
I never saw it until I was actually in it
You really gotta be in it
To understand what its like
But you always gotta
People always gotta see your smile
You always gotta put on that fake
You know what I'm sayin
No matter what you just been through

(B-Real)
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large a big house
5 cars, you're in charge
Comin up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

(B-Real)
I remember the days when I was a young kid growin up
Lookin in the mirror dreamin about blowin up
To rock crowds make money
Chill wit the honies
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
Shits funny
How impossible dreams manifest and the games that be comin with it
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears
And losin some of your peers
And losin some of your self
Through the years past gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac in the brainiac
Don't know how to act
Shits deep
48 tracks
Studio gangsta mack
Signs a deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil
But never will
Till he crosses over still
Feelin no hate
But fantasies come wit these
Shows the sacrifice it takes to make the G's
You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz?
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games
But the price of fame is high
And some can't pay to play
Trapped in what you rappin about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The route you took started collapsing
No fans
No fame
No respect
No change
No women
And everyone shits on your name

(Chorus)
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house
5 cars
You're in charge
Comin up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house
5 cars
You're in charge
Comin up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

(Noreaga Speaking)
When you sign to a record label
You don't know you sign your life over
And these white boys don't care about you
'Cuz the minute you fall off
They'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone-n-Noreaga
And they'll find another B-Real
So you need to just keep
Stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while your hot
And mo'fuckin get out the game
Stick to the drug game
And it's even worse than the the drug game
Because if someone jerks you
You can shoot em and kill em
But in this game if someone jerks you
You gotta be humble

(Eminem Speaking)
No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
You gotta approach people
You gotta be on the up and up
And everything gotta be all good
When you see someone slap hands with em
You know what I'm sayin' give em a pound
Or whatever it is
But you always gotta act like it ain't shit

(Chorus)

(B-Real)
My own son don't know me
Sittin up in the hotel room lonely
But I thank God I'm wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or videos
Cuz they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like Monie
And the press say that
My own people disown me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at the Paladium
Who just wanna cling on and swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar
Wit no shame give him a year
And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame
Started gettin ignored
I warned him
Assured him
This ain't easy take it from Weezy
Sleezy people wanna be cheesey
They talkin evil

(Chorus)
