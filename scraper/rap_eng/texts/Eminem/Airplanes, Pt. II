[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

[Post-Chrous: B.o.B]
Dreaming…
Of falling
Dreaming…
Of falling

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah
Let's pretend like it's '98
Like I'm eatin' lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Tryin' to be the next rapper comin' out the A (A-Town)
Hopin' for a record deal to ignore my pain
Yeah, now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane
Okay, and everybody know my name (Bob)
And everywhere I go people want to hear me sang
Oh yeah, and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring, and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Sellin' out arenas with big-ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Okay
Let's pretend like this never happened (never)
Like I never had dreams of bein' a rapper (rapper)
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes (classes)
Like I never used to run away into the blackness (yeah)
Now, let's pretend like it was all good (good)
Like I didn't live starin' in the notebook (notebook)
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should (should)
But I ain't have neighbors, that's why they call it hood (hood)
Yeah, now let's pretend like I ain't got a name (no)
Before they ever called me B.o.B or A.K.A. Bobby Ray
I'm talkin' back before the mixtapes (Cloud 9)
Before the videos and the deals and the fame (yeah)
Before they ever once compared me to André (3 stacks)
Before I ever got on MySpace (yeah)
Before they ever noticed my face (yeah)
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes, in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes, in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

[Bridge: B.o.B. & Eminem]
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone, they're just memories
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone

[Verse 3: Eminem]
All right
Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things woulda been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind, "Marshall, you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game, there ain't no way that you'll win."
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changin' again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch
"You won't amount to shit – quit daydreamin', kid!
You need to get your cranium checked
You're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic."
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him, but he didn't make it
To the Rap Olympics, slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Lainey
These food stamps and this WIC shit
‘Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap, so he ain't even here, he pretends that—

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
