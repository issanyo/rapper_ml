[Chorus 1: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it callin' like a siren (oh oh)
We don't want no problems
We don't like them, keep it moving
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)

[Verse 1: P!nk]
I just wanna play
Big city, holiday
So get out of my way
If you know
What's better for ya

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
I'm tearing up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not looking for a fight, no (oh oh)
High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb about to go (off!)

[Chorus 2: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it callin' like a siren (oh oh)
We don't look for trouble
Just enough to see in double

[Hook: P!nk]
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set of your sirens (oh oh)

[Verse 2: P!nk]
Drink some pink champagne
I don't know you yet
But we'll forget so
Fuck what they say
Let's run the floor
Until it breaks

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
I'm tearing up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not looking for a fight, no (oh oh)
High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb about to go (off!)

[Chorus 2: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it callin' like a siren (oh oh)
We don't look for trouble
Just enough to see in double

[Hook: P!nk]
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yep, yep
Nothing high class in my glass, only bottles I pop
Are bottles of pop so when I pop up in the spot
I'm prob-ably not gonna be wanting to pop bubbly or Ciroc
I'm not Puffy, but I'mma run the city tonight
When I hit it, I might act like a fricking idiot
Diddy mixed with a medieval knight
Big city lights, little indignity
Hot diggity, this Biggie is getting me hype
I don't get some liquor, I'll hurt you, I'll knock your dick in the dirt
Bickering worse than that bitch in that Snickers commercial
A mixture of Stiffler and Urkel, hanging from the light fixture
I hope you pricks are insured for this building 'cause we're tearing it down
Security, get out the fricking way, Jesus Chrysler LeBaron itâ€™s loud
I swear the only thing I hear is the sound
Of sirens going AHH AHH
'Cause

[Hook: P!nk]
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
(Oh oh)

[Hook: P!nk]
Here comes the weekend
Set of your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
