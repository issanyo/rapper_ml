[Intro]
Yo, yo
(Huh, huh, huh, huh)
Aight, aight (huh)
Slim Shady
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse]
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4 door Ford
But I'm more towards droppin' an a cappella that'll chop a fella
To mozzarella, worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showin'
Developin' anorexia while I'm standin' next to ya
Eatin' a full course meal watchin' you starve to death
With an IV in your veins feedin' you liquid darvocet
Pumpin' you full of drugs, pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receivin' with the asses ripped out of they pants and given
A less than 20 percent chance of livin'
Have a possible placement, it's a hospital patient
Storin' the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream, "I'm still alive!"
Drivin' a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pullin' your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpets and burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight, you need a crowbar to pry her apart with

[Outro]
Motherfucker
Slim Shady, bitch
Recognize
For the 99
I'm on February 23rd
