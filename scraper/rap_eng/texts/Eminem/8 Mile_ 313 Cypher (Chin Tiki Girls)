[Parking Lot Rapper #2 (Obie Trice)]
I use my voice to spit the fiery frame
Try and refrain, dying in vain
Soon as I reply in [?]
I be the nigga in the Shelter who be eyeing your chain

[Parking Lot Rapper #3 (Njeri Earth)]
Three-one-three area, bound to bury ya with vengeance
My rhymes sentences'll put an end to your existence with the rigorousness
Niggas, I'm serious, delirious, cause a curious... pause
The fury calls from my jaws from devouring y'all raw

[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]
You forced to listen to the individual, the metaphysical
The Mac Mitten, rhyme ritual, heterosexual
Syllables they sound complex to you, lines perplexing you
With words that could put a hex on you, snap that neck on you
Murder you, boil you, we keep a white boy or two
Let my man grab the mic, you see how Bunny Rabbit do

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
Your style is generic, mine's authentic made
I roll like a renegade, you need clinic aid
My technique is bizarre and ill; I scar and kill
You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill
As I proceed to cook and grill ya, that’s all it took to kill ya
You better recognize me like I look familiar
You want to battle? You beat around the bush
Like you're scared to lick pussy so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push, someone that I can bully
Wait a minute, I don’t think you understand fully
See me without a style's like mustard without the Heinz’s
I lead the new school, you a Busta without the rhymes
I crush the shit out your lines

[Sol George (Omar Benson Miller)]
Now I'm the Rashiki smoking the lick licky
Ten freaky girls inside The Chin Tiki
Girl, when you see me you better believe me
This ain't a game and pimping ain't easy
Anything goes when it comes to hoes
I'm the kingpin when it comes to flows
You better ask someone if you don't know
When you see me girl, say what up doe
Ten freaky girls, ten, ten, ten freaky girls
