[Verse 1: Slim Shady]

It's the Bushman with art in a dart
It’s six o clock sharp you hear them dogs startin to bark
And while they're carving a mark in ya arm, with teeth sharper than sharks
Im out in the parking lot stripping ya car for ya parts
Boy I was rhyming when you was mispronouncing my name
Like E-minem, now you look for my tapes and can’t find em
Back in the day I'da killed for some radio play
But now i’m with Dre, and I still don’t give a fuck either way
But ima trust Bush to give me a thrust and a push
While these other radio stations are busy playin’ puss
So look to the next man and if he ain’t clapping his hands
Throw him in the bush so fast he gets stabbed in his back with a branch
It’s 98 the one station that runs town
And two DJs rippin’ from sun up to sun down
From sun down to sun up
Slim shady still don’t give a thumbs down
With three fingers and keep the middle one up
It’s 98 WJLB
Watch in October for the Slim Shady LP

[Outro]
Bushman art in a dart
Bushman art in a dart
