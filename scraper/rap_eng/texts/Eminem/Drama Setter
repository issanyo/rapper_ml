[Prison guard]
"Mr. Yayo, you're free to go
So, I guess this means I'll see you tomorrow, eh?"

[Intro: Eminem + (Tony Yayo)]
{*Eminem laughs*}
Yeah! Ha ha, guess who's home?!
Tony Yayo! Yeah! Obie Trice, c'mon!
(Here we go now!)

[Hook: Eminem]
I'm a drama setter
Grippin' my Berretta, sippin' Amaretto
Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it
Just don't get in the way of my cheddar
Man, ‘cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go lookin' for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma crying
‘Cause her only son is dying
She don't know it's just your karma catchin' up
‘Cause I'm a drama setter

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
I'll poke you, man, I'm Rikers Island Pokemon
I got CO's bringin' me filet mignon
But now a nigga home, lookin' frail in the drop (whattup?)
With a bitch shotgun that's inhalin' the cock
I got rocks on my neck the size of bottle tops
And got Glocks in the Lex, so we ride behind cops
Broke days, we used to put water in our cereal
Now we're crossin' borders just to shoot another video
It's Tony Montana on full-body armor
Soning niggas, like Alfredo in The Godfather
Two-shot revolver, that Dillinger shit
And the AR-15 bending your six
We taking trips to Morocco just to tan
We smoke weed in restaurants in Amsterdam
I was worth a hundred grams, now I'm worth a cool million
I'll put money on your hairline, your dime and your children

[Hook: Eminem]
I'm a drama setter
Grippin' my Berretta, sippin' Amaretto
Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it
Just don't get in the way of my cheddar
Man, ‘cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go lookin' for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma crying
‘Cause her only son is dying
She don't know it's just your karma catchin' up
‘Cause I'm a drama setter

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Since Yayo is home, them AR's is drawn
Obie's Guerilla-Unit, fuck affiliation
We are one, it is senseless for you to prevent this
The .40 cal'll put you up under some photosynthesis
At any given instant (gunshot), another incident
You just got a glimpse of Obie and Yay's temperment
And we holdin' them K's, that's why homie won't age
Isn't it that Tony's enraged they throw him in cages?
But now my nigga's loose, our crews is bulletproof
All brought to you from whom's pupils' baby blues
His short fuses put your portrait on the news
Nigga, them screws is loose
When you fuckin' with them Shady dudes

[Hook: Eminem]
I'm a drama setter
Grippin' my Berretta, sippin' Amaretto
Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it
Just don't get in the way of my cheddar
Man, ‘cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go lookin' for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma crying
‘Cause her only son is dying
She don't know it's just your karma catchin' up
‘Cause I'm a drama setter

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
I got fat while I was gone, but now I'm here
And y'all rappers only bust shots only in fear
Chinchillas on my back, itchy fingers on the MAC
Get scrilla off of crack, get 50's shooter back
Listen, homie, don't let them niggas amp you, money
‘Cause I got niggas in Queens that kill for Pamper money
Move like Keyzer, Jayson Williams, slaughter the driver
My daughter Maniyah, know that the kid spit fire
Reality rap, nigga, check my salary cap
I give guns to my soldiers with a battery pack
What you know about light planes and heavy coke?
And them drugs being smuggled on them fast speed boats?
It's the rap tycoon, Tony, y'all all know me
See me on MTV, I'm a parolee
I was out for twelve hours and went right back in
For three hots and one cot doing time in the pen

[Hook: Eminem]
I'm a drama setter
Grippin' my Berretta, sippin' Amaretto
Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it
Just don't get in the way of my cheddar
Man, ‘cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go lookin' for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma crying
‘Cause her only son is dying
She don't know it's just your karma catchin' up
‘Cause I'm a drama setter
