[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
Cheddar, I can rip you to a shred a
Cheddar cheese, there's not a better MC than me
I'm B-Rabbit, bitch, sting like a bee
Float like a butterfly, what am I, so what if I
Cut a guy, did I s-s-stutter guy
Leave you punch drunk from lunch truck to Shelter
You never felt the wrath or felt the skelter, melt ya
Got the belt for the welterweight champ
You got in with a fake stamp
Garbage bag full of clothes, still pullin' hoes
Rip you from head to toe, from leg to bullet hole
Next gun pull it slow
And aim at the Free World 'fore you let it go
Instead of "Oh, I just shot my dick head"
And yes, you do got a big head
I can't call it, Cheddar where's your wallet?
You're so drunk, you can outdrink the alcoholics
Make 'em say "Damn, Cheddar's the man
He needs a can surgically removed from his hand"
