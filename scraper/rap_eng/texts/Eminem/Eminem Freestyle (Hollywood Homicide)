Hey yo, what do you think about two grown ass men
Living together?
Alright. What do you think about another grown ass man
Living right upstairs from them?
Well those two grown ass men
Living together on my nuts
And that shits right above them

When I rhyme somehow I think I must subliminally
Throwing viagra at these fags who got these hard-ons for me
But I suppose anything goes when it comes to my flows
Nothing is off limits except for Michaels' nose!
I didn’t know, I'm so sorry please tell me what I can do
To make it up to those of you who I offended. Ooh!
I got it, I got it, apology for Steve Harvey too, it’s in my pocket
(Oh wait, here it is)
FUCK YOU!! Hey!
What do you say Andre whats new? Life is good man I’m chilling, 50 how 'bout you?
Yayo's out of jail, Buck is out on bail, we’ll make it through, we always do
ODB, rest in peace, G-G-G-UNIT!
