[Verse / Freestyle]
Now don't think I won't hit you because I'm popular
I got a P-90 Ruger to pop at ya
Catch you slipping I'ma give you what I got for ya
My clip loaded with 16 shots for ya
You never had a hot gun on ya waist and blood on your shoe
Because a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you
Homie, you ain't been through what I been through
You not like me, and I'm not like you
I'm like an animal wit it when I spit it's crazy
Got semi-autos to put holes in niggas tryin' to play me
One shot is not enough you need at least a Uzi to move me
After four bottles of Dom the kid start to feeling woozy
I write my life, you write what you see in gangsta movies
I'm gangsta to the core, nigga you can't move me
I find my space at the top, I got this rap shit locked
I never heard of you, you heard of me, I murder you
Spit shells to your convertible
Lotus you notice richer or poor
Hollow steel go through your door, this is war
You scared of me you not prepared for me the kid is back
50 Cent, I know you like that, I know you like that
