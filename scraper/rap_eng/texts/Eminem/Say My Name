[Intro: Eminem]
This ain't beef man
I don't know what the fuck to call it
But no beef
What up X

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I float like B.I.G.'s spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly
Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'd have my motherfucking ass kicked by Moby
If I let some bitch in the Can like Bis cop over me
To do war and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop to that level to do that now
I got a new cat, this time I'm pulling two gats out
With bullets, I finally got something to shoot at now

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the Glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who really want their name in the streets
Let's see who wanna die the same time as me
And make ends meet
Now was I blessed with a gift or cursed with a curse
I follow hearse after hearse with verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree
So now ...

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
Why do you hate me ?
I came from nothing, blood sweat and tears, you did not create me
How can you doubt me? You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West coast without me
Cut with the bullshit, I struggle for survival
And now you trying to act like my rival
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life, nigga, it's not worth
All the pain (all the pain), all the agony (all the agony)
All the horror (all the horror), all the tragedy (all the tragedy)
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life? (C'mon!) One day you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the fuck you think you talking to
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in front of you

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I could have been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him
Purple, for mimicking him with two rapping Urkels
I could have snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I Square Dance cause I'm sick of rapping circles
Around these clowns, steady trying to call me out
It's like I'm listening to motherfucking dogs meow
You'd probably do better trying to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about, c'mon
(I) No gangsta you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit ether
(Not) I shit across your belly
(Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly
(X) Pass me the weed, I'mma put my ashes out on his ass
For the last time, man (Watch your fucking mouth)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name

[Outro: Eminem]
For the last time, man, I'm through
