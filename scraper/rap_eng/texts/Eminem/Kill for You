[Intro: Skylar Grey]
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
In my eyes
Even if you are wrong, you are right
Even if it's a terrible crime, it's alright
Cause I got your back, and I know you got mine
I belong to the church of your name, Sing a song
'Cause I worship the ground you walk on
If I pray for you, I know you'll be there

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

[Verse 2: Skylar Grey]
In my bed I believe every word that you've said
Just a kiss and you make me forget
All the bad, the battles we lost, the bodies we hid
You don't know, just how far I'd be willing to go
You put the cracks into my moral code
So you can count on me to always be there

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
Oh, lord, forgive my weary hands
And for what they may do
I'll carry out his evil plans
If he wants me to

[Verse 3: Eminem]
In your dream, you're drownin', I just waltz in and saved you
I'm your alternate escape route, the altar you pray to
Your ultimate savior, your behavior is altered
Ain't your fault 'cause I made you
Brainwash and persuade you
Gibraltar, your faith'll never falter or waver
One you call to in danger, I'm your guardian angel
Nobody can tell you shit, you've already made your
Mind just follow me, babe, you
Won't be sorry you stayed, you
Always ride, whatever the plan is
'Til the end, even if I led us into an ambush
Even if we robbed a First National and cops caught us redhanded
They're coming at us, and we're trapped with our backs up
Against the wall, and it's too tall
You'd catapult me or hold the ladder for me
Stay back to get captured, take the fall
You make it all worth it
Baby doll, you're perfect the way you are
Accidents happen
All I know is you love me, that's really all that matters
And any who cross our paths are just collateral damage
At your side, got your lateral, back, your front, diagonal
Backwards, blackbirds, we attack like animals
When they threaten what we have it's a natural reaction
You'll lay a bitch flat on her back in a second flat for me
Who tries to take your man from you
It's blasphemy, another casualty, you'll go whatever route
Do whatever you have to do, you'd blast for me
I never doubt that
That's 'cause you

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you
