[Intro]
Yo check this out! In life, you got your wannabe's
You got your gonnabe's, and you got your hasbeen's
Then you got your hustlers and hardcore

[Domingo]
Oh a line with fakes a time
Fresh time, with sure more times
Jimminy two time respect mine
Big click with breakfast and blacklist
War! War! War! War!
Vision, knocking you out motherfucker listen
Superstition can help you in this battle
G's and sandles who surround you in all the angles
All over your shit in shamble
Looking the little of latter you fucking runt

[Hook 2x]
Hustlers! Hustlers and Hardcore!
Giving you more than what you asking for!
Say what, say what, we’re hustlers and hardcore
Keeping it right, keeping it rough keeping it raw

[Domingo]
Danger hander
Banging swinging banner all single hander
Hit the left propaganda
Ill manner bad grammar stander
Got the people chasing with cameras by the manner
Hit and slap us, so pajamas
Hiding in the hampers under dirty pampers
Happy brands will make them happy campers
Little laughter
Shit nappers

[Eminem]
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fucking G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin to shoot you
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet, 'til it spins on a broken axis

[Hook 2x]
Hustlers! Hustlers and Hardcore!
Giving you more than what you asking for!
Say what, say what, we’re hustlers and hardcore
Keeping it right, keeping it rough keeping it raw

[Domingo]
Aw yeah {*echoes*}
