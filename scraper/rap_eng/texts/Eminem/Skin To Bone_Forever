[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Skin to bone, steel to rust
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Let tomorrow have its way
With the promises we made
Skin to bone, steel to rust

[Verse 2: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go; Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' the name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up outta of our mouths
Now rewind it—pay back, motherfucker
For the way that you got at me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake…

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(Aaah) Ash to Ashes, dust to dust
(Aaah) Skin to bone and steel to rust

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Will tomorrow have its way
With the promises betrayed?
Skin to bone and steel to rust (x3)
