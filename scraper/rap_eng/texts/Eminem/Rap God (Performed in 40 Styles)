[Intro: Anthony Vincent]
"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings."
"But it's been way to long since the last 20 Style song."
"So how about I give you 40 styles this time?"
"Some of you doubt I can do it, and if I prove you wrong, we're in big trouble."
"Why don't we take it from the first verse?"

Verse 1
[Style 1: Eminem]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lew-

[Style 2: MC Hammer]
-insky feeling on his (oh-oh)
I'm an MC still as honest (oh-oh)
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with) this...

[Style 3: Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony]
...flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a mother-butchin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only...

[Style 4: Beastie Boys]
...realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact (fact)
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack (tack)

[Style 5: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Rappers are havin' a rough time period (oo-ooh)
Here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack (yeah)
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece 'cause...

Chorus 1
[Style 6: Aerosmith & Run D.M.C.]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God (Rap God), Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod

[Style 7: Louis Armstrong]
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this ain't that hard

[Style 8: Bjork]
Everybody want the key and the secret
To rap immortality like I got (Well, to be...)

Verse 2
[Style 9: Rage Against The Machine]
...truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since

[Style 10: Busta Rhymes]
(Hoo!) MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a...

[Style 11: 2Pac]
...product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and...

[Style 12: Die Antwoord (Yolandi & Ninja)]
...be in a position
Om te voldoen aan Run-D.M.C., Lei hulle in
In die Motherfuckin 'Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Alhoewel ek in die kerk sal loop en in 'n vuurvlam gebars het
Slegs Hall of Fame Ek sal ingehuldig word in is die alcohol of fame (fame)
On the wall of shame (shame)

[Style 13: LL Cool J]
You girls think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what are you thinkin'? (a game)

[Style 14: Ray Charles]
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy
You're witnessin' a massacre
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy

[Style 15: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!"—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dr. Dre, lookin' boy (la-da-da-da-dah)

[Style 16: Elmo]
I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for crack
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause...

Chorus 2
[Style 17: Linkin Park (Chester, Mike & Both)]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR

[Style 18: Megadeth]
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard

Verse 3
[Style 19: Aqua (Lene & Rene)]
You'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You're rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'

[Style 20: House of Pain]
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom jumpin' around (jump, jump, jump)

[Style 21: DMX]
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

[Style 22: Sublime]
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure, somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To...

[Style 23: Daddy Yankee]
Tal vez trate de ayudar a algunas personas a través de tiempos difíciles
Pero tengo que mantener algunas líneas de puñetazos
Por si acaso, porque ni siquiera has firmado
Los raperos están hambrientos mirándome como si fuera la hora del almuerzo

[Style 24: Pharoahe Monch]
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I...

[Style 25: "Weird Al" Yankovic]
...crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To... (hey)

[Style 26: Big Pun]
...censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Colum-

[Style 27: Mudvayne]
-bine!
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm

[Style 28: Justin Timberlake]
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the … that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fu- cornrows

[Style 29: Tech N9ne]
You write normal? I get strange with it (Tech N9ne)
I just bought a new Raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel (yeah)

[Style 30: Simon & Garfunkel]
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed
J.J. Fad, uh...

[Style 1: Eminem (again)]
Summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman

[Style 31: Twista]
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating

[Style 32: Set The Charge (his band)]
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it

[Style 33: Quartetto Cetra]
"Non è hip-hop, è pop," - perché ho trovato un modo eccezionale per fonderlo
Con rock, shock rap con Doc
Buttati su "Lose Yourself" e falle perdere

[Style 34: The Micro Machines Man]
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to?
Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you

[Style 35: Michael Jackson]
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, ah!
I'm drunk—so, Satan, take the, ah, wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz

[Style 36: Heavy D and the Boyz]
Still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me

[Style 37: Frank Sinatra]
They're askin' me to elimi-

[Style 38: Slipknot]
-nate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons?

[Style 39: Chris Brown]
Make lemonade then! (yeah)
But if I can't batter the women
How am I supposed to bake them a cake then?

[Style 40: Eric B. & Rakim]
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard! Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?
