Kick a hypest lyric every time I run upon a track
You know I'm not wack
You have to step back
'Cause if you don't I'll prove that I'm the mac
Every time I kick a lyric tune it to two-ninety-five
Yo do you find me live?
If you don't then that's all right 'cause I'll just grab the microphone
And I just got to get so hype when I speak in a hyper tone
There's so many styles I might get thrown
And here's a place where I like to roam
And all the girls that I like to bone
Have the big butts, no they don't 'cause I don't like that nigga shit
I'm just here to make a bigger hit
When I be kickin' the hypest dopest rhymes
Just say that Eminem is the best MC in of all times
