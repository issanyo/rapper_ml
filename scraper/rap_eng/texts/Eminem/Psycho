[Intro: 50 Cent]
I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
Yeah, yeah, I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
Yeah, yeah, I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)
I'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
I said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)
I'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)
They wanna see me shot up (shot up)
Locked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)
I'll come back bigger (bigger)
Stronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah, look look, I come from a different crew, you fuck with me I'll get to you
A clip or two I'll cripple you just 'cause I ain't got shit to do
Pistol pop, a pussy drop, drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie mini moe, nine, trey pound or forty fo'
Pick a strap, The Tec, the Mac, the Hawk, I stab it in your back
I'll blow your brains, I know your name and where you rest, I make a mess
The hollow tips will hit your chest, you cough up blood 'til EMS
Come pick you up, you know you're fucked when you get on the stretcher
'Cause I come into ICU to see you off to Heaven
The system I done been through, it is nothing new to it to me
They lock me up, they let me out, you seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals while they up in corrections
They come home get, a nine, then commit crime in perfection
It's murder one, they found a gun, now they doing ballistics
But they can't find a fingerprint, the shit's going terrific
Get so close on your target that it's really hard to miss it

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)
I'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
I said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)
I'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)
They wanna see me shot up (shot up)
Locked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)
I'll come back bigger (bigger)
Stronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Man, these are average raps, I'm keeping the savage batch hid
In the can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath lid
You pop off the top, it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sac with MAC-10s
Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins
Dead fetuses falling out all over, Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fucking backyard
Still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog
How late you wanna stay out?
It's past your curfew when it's dark
I'm searching for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI, they hate us, but they gotta give a lot of props
If drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)
I'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
I said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)
I'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)
They wanna see me shot up (shot up)
Locked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)
I'll come back bigger (bigger)
Stronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, I'm as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me
Killing so villainously
Still as maniacal on the NyQuil and psycho as Michael Myers
You know what we're like on the motherfucking mic so try us
And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers

[50 Cent]
It's operation time, they got him hooked up to wires
Squeezing, be bleeding, wheezing, breathing, he half dead
He must ain't know, but now we know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Lead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn
School of arts, Julliard, you better learn learn

[Eminem]
Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn turn
I'm debating mutilating the lady
You've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her - I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her
And put her through the wringer and hung her over the wash tub

[50 Cent]
When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit, end up nauseous
Look deep in my eye, see many many men die
I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)
I'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
I said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)
I'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)
They wanna see me shot up (shot up)
Locked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)
I'll come back bigger (bigger)
Stronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)
