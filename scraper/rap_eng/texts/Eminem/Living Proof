[Intro: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, Bad and Evil is (back)
(Don't stop)

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
We 'bout to get into a tale of a gunner that details the dungeon
Just as the pale moon illuminates the hail and thunderin'
'01's the year where I fell from blunderin'
Shady lifted his wing, then I fell from under it
Now I’m freefallin’, my career is gone into re-calling
Regardless of who’s fault, I was speedballin'
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth
Then Marshall doubled back and got me from on top of the Hearse
I’m alive, nigga, Justin T ain’t got nothin' on me
'Cause I done cried Mary J. Blige rivers
I realized that God’s with us, soon as I decided
To put that bottle down and pick up my Todd Bridges
The writing's on the wall
Since niggas seen me at the baseball game
With Shady and Jay-Z, suddenly everybody calls
Like, "I’m just checking on you, dog!"
While I throw up this message on the stall

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
When them bottles stop poppin’ and them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop)
I made a promise to my momma, I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop? (don't stop)
I’m living proof, nigga, it's pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
It's the Worldwide American way, I’m living proof, nigga

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Your body language is sayin’ your confidence is gone
Well, pick ya ass up, lil' homie, come on
You just gon' sit there and take it or make 'em suck it?
Tell 'em where to shove it straight up
You gon' make love to the world or you gon' fuck it?
The last time that life kicked me in the ass
I pulled down its pants and put a foot up its ass
Man, what a catastrophe it’d be for me to be a bitch-ass pussy
And not open a can of whoop-ass, let you piss-ants whoop me
Will be the day I say I ate poop, shit, the day that
I don't straight shoot, I'll drop outta my anti-women hate group
Say I’m a sissy faggot, record it, play it back
And put it on straight loop, you haters look like you ate a grape fruit
To see me climbing back on that wagon, got my swagger back
I was dragging, hopped back on it, grab the reigns on that bastard
And came back on 'em without remorse man
Man, of course, I’m a one-trick pony
'Cause I’ll be screaming on these whores 'til I’m hoarse!

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
When them bottles stop poppin’ and them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop)
I made a promise to my momma, I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop? (don't stop)
I’m living proof, nigga, it's pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
It's the Worldwide American way, I’m living proof, nigga

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Nah, I ain't fading yet, I’d rather stay and rap
I might've made a debt but I find excitement in wondering what I’ma write next so I don't stay in debt
Me broke, you might as well cut the embryo
Out of my momma and play catch
With the baby with AKs with baby bayonets
I’ma get rich or I’ma die trying
That's why it's either kill or be killed
So call me suicide homicide Ryan

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There's a bomb inside my head, I’m a live wire
I am on the edge, teetering on it like a totter, I might
Get on a nut like a tire iron, I have no desire stopping
So why would I drop and roll? That's how much on fire I am
Rappers are fun and I’m the time 'cause I’m just flying by ‘em
Man, I’m laughing at ‘em the entire time, why am I up?
'Cause tribulations I have triumphed, bitch, I’m fired up
"So one time for me, just let your fuckin' lighters light the sky up"

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
When them bottles stop poppin’ and them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop)
I made a promise to my momma, I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop? (don't stop)
I’m living proof, nigga, it's pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
It's the Worldwide American way, I’m living proof, nigga
