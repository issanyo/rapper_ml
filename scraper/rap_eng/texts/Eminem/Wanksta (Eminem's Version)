[Intro]
Woooo! It's Shady aka the Army Shady Records
Break it down

I do a lotta spittin' and I don't gotta try
But I ain't got rhymes to waste so let's make it
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop something

[Verse 1]
I got a friend of mine, named 50 Cent I signed
This shit's official now, the deals is finished and it's time
To get down to this business, let's get these nicks and dimes
So hurry up and cop, G-Unit shit before it's gone
Its like a gold mine for my man to take nine
And bounce right back, he gotta be like Michael Myers
This shit must be a sign, these labels must be blind
Columbia, I know this must be fucking with they mind
They know they 'bout to cry cause they missed out
But I know how to get the dough cause Dre gave me a business mind
I said in my line, I hit 'em with a nine
I had a empty clip but they ain't check the chamber

[Chorus]
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel my shit, you gonna hit the stop button
We fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel my shit, you gonna hit the stop button
We fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'

[Verse 2]
Damn 50, this shit's about to hit the fan 50
Fuck happened to Ja?
He got the sickest vendetta, he must think that you betta
He bought to play with his paper, you gonna fuck with this chedda
Now homie think we gon' sweat 'em but we just gon' forget 'em
If he don't shut up we'll dead'em, let Yayo stomp his head in
It's all good cause we'd rather rap then to let a
Pussy play us outta pocket homie, so tell 'em
He better be easy
Start some bullshit, he'll get his whole crew wet
D-Twizzy, Obie, 50 Cent and G-Unit
Yo, he don't want it cause he's always drugged out
You won't see one picture where his pupils ain't bugged out

[Chorus]
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel my shit, you gonna hit the stop button
We fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel my shit, you gonna hit the stop button
We fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'
