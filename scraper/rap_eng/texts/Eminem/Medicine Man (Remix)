[Intro: Candice Pillay] Don't let me find out, the bitch in you Don't let me find out, the snitch in you  [Hook: Candice Pillay] Fame and fortune, it's not your forte Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself Take two of these in the morning, overdose and kill yourself Doctor's orders...

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Listen, this is my evaluation This shit over saturated, y'all can get evacuated Kids sipping Actavis and they ain't even activated Married to the internet, stuck in place, salivating Ain't nobody graduating Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it That's why I gotta hate it Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration Damn I'm getting aggravated, fuck, I'm getting agitated Teachers so underpaid in these fucking schools The police got our name in all they databases Girls be thirteen acting twenty-two Niggas be forty-four acting half they ages Somebody tell me, what the fuck is going on? These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fucking Matrix It's looking like a sign of the revelation 'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest I got all these patients man How come they ain't patient with me? They just think I want the money, why? When I can't take it with me Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not They gon' find out who you are, just admit 'fore you get admitted

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak] Say, what you living about, fuck you gon' tell me Do you remember where you started out though You looking lost now (You want a pass, oh damn) Fake it 'til you make it, take your little paper book When you look in the mirror your credibility’s gone now I'd rather be hated on for who I am Than to be loved for who I'm not, that's word to Doc  [Hook: Candice Pillay] Fame and fortune, it's not your forte Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself Take two of these in the morning, overdose and kill yourself

[Verse 2: ApolloX]
If it's my time then I'll tell you when it's yours
But before that don't step to me, cause that'll mean your a whore
And I don't mean to be bored, but I don't give a fuck what you say about my decor
So get the fuck off my shore, and I'll show you what it means to be lord
You see these bitches think that they can control
But they don't realize who the fuck they're dealing with so they just preform
I don't think they know, and if they really flow then I'll have to show them the form
And they'll get all fucking deformed
Then I'll show them who's boss, and it's not Ricky Ross
You want to, go up in it and then show out and blow it
You got to, come out with the blow out and go out with a showdown
You needa pick up the phone and call the docs rock when the hot lock comes and the Hawks cock
Cocks the gun and socks the run and some will hate the rhythm that I have brung, so bring the damn rum and don't be a motherfuckin bum
Showing you the way of life and it won't be nothing but a fife
You get in then get out don't do nothing else cause it's just a spout and small like sour like the crout
And when the flow gets cold remember that it's gold and old
Just don't give it a small fold
You see the way I will go is in a slow but fast way and the castaways will go show and blow off the fuckers that know that they ain't shit when it comes to the game of rap and tap and motherfuckin slap the cap
All these suckers think that we fuckers but the news that you don't know is that you the pluckers and we the ones that make you suffer
So all the quickest and sickest spitting sitters and sinners come slither, slip, slide and glide and make their way to the Clyde and cynical cyanide filled bitches and snitches go and motherfuckin die
All these patients and patent protection rapping pair of partners come and say "fuck your new rap song" but I say back "fuck your company and all that reside to fly and die like my pie for a lie"
But you don't know the sound that I bring and the clowning pound of the mound when minority goes and stands out
I'm tired of all of the motherfuckin fake ass Doctors so get off my chest and you just might become a Procter
All I need is a scope and the hope that stands with the pope will soak in blood because the tamed were never ready for the...
