[Verse 1]
I let my watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me, blow, what up, homie?
My watch saying "Hi shorty, we can be friends"
My whip saying "Quit playing, bitch, get in"
My earring saying "We can hit the mall together"
Shorty, it's only right that we ball together
I'm into bigger things, y'all niggas, y'all know my style
Your wrist "bling bling", my shit "bling blaow"
My pinky ring talk, it say "Fifty, I'm sick"
That's why these niggas is on my dick
Some hate me, some love my hits
Flex my man he gon' bump my shit
See I'm a liar, man, I really don't care
I tell them hoes whatever they wanna hear
You tryna play me, Imma blaze ya then
My cross cost more than the crib ya mamma raised ya in

[Hook]
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga

[Verse 2]
New York niggas copy niggas like it's all good
Fuck around ,we crip-walking in the wrong hood
I'm fresh up out the slammer, I ain't no fucking bama
I'm from NY whoady, but I know country grammar
See me I get it crunk, niggas go head and front
I go up out the trunk, come back, roll out, I'm done
My money come in lumps, my pockets got the mumps
You see me sitting on dubs, that's why you mad chump
Don't make me hit ya up, these shells will split ya up
I lay you down, the coroners will come and get ya up
See 50 play for keeps and 50 stay with heat
I can't go commercial, they love me in the street
I'm real gutta, man; the hood love me, man
Don't make me show up in ya crib like bruh man
Locked up in a pen, I still do my thing
CO screaming "Shut the fuck up!" in the bing

[Hook]
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga

[Verse 3]
I'm in the Benz on Monday, the BM on Tuesday
Range on Wednesday, Thursday I'm in the hooptay
Porsche on Friday, I do things my way
Vipe or Vette, I tear up the highway
Shorty'll tell ya I'm 'bout my dick-game
But she don't know me, she only know my nickname
Left the hood and came back, damn shit changed
These young boys, they done got they own work, man

[Hook]
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga
