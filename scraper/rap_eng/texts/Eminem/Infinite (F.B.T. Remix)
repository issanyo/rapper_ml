[Intro]
Ah, yeah (It's like this, like this)
This is Eminem, baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
('Til forever, 'til forever)
One time for your motherfuckin' mind (For MC's, MC's)
We represent the 313, you know what I’m saying?
Yo, they don’t know shit about this, for the '96

[Verse 1]
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
I travel through your mind, and chill your spine like siren drills
I'm slimin' grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
And twistin' necks of rappers
'Til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue
Turn your system up, twist 'em up
And indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car-tunes than animation
My lamination of narration
Hits a snare and bass on a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion
There ain't no time to be starin', gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland

[Hook]
I'm Infinite; you heard of Hell
Well, I was sent from it
I went to it, serving a sentence
For murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

[Verse 2]
Bust it! I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
A crew to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep-full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's, and stand the lonely one
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
My a cappella releases classic masterpieces
Through telekinesis, it eases you mentally
Gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

[Hook]
I'm Infinite; you heard of Hell
Well, I was sent from it
I went to it, serving a sentence
For murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

[Verse 3]
Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense
And I've been clever ever since my residence was hesitant
To do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assuming all responsibility
‘Cause there's a monster will in me
That always wants to kill MCs
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one else is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam, plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, ‘cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit, and tempted
When I see the sins my friends commit

[Hook]
I'm Infinite; you heard of Hell
Well, I was sent from it
I went to it, serving a sentence
For murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

[Outro]
'95, '96 ('96)
And on and on and on (and on and on)
