[Intro: Dr Dre and 50 Cent]
Ha ha
I'm back, bastards!
(Oh yeah)
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
(Feels good)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Listen you can call me what you want, black and ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my cds drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a track-star, running through life, chasing my dream
Best deal I made was trading the mic for that triple beam
I zone off thinking is there really heaven or hell
So what happens to a changed man who dies in a cell
I need no answers to these questions, 'cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
Is a gift given from God so I'ma use it
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard, when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A old G told me God's favorites have a hard time
You out the hood, that's good now stay on the grind

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Some days, I'm in the crowd all by myself
Bunch of niggas around I'm still by myself
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I drift off on a cloud by myself
Thinking bout nothing more than life, what else
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me

[Verse 2: 2pac]
Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold
With my heart open, greed, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen, rise (rise)
My ghetto queen, rise (rise)
Don't be afraid to try (try)
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Some days, I'm in the crowd all by myself
Bunch of niggas around I'm still by myself
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I drift off on a cloud by myself
Thinking bout nothing more than life, what else
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My friends can't understand this new me
That's understandable, man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's looking at you, what you want me to do?
I'm starting to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame's starting to give me an excuse to be at a all time low
I sit alone in my home theater watching the same damn DVD
Of the first tour, the last tour he was still alive
And it hurts so I fast forward, sleeping pills will make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I'll just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfucking right
I ain't slowing down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on dole 'em out
Daddy, don't you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice
Yeah baby hold me down

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Some days, I'm in the crowd all by myself

Thinking bout nothing more than life, what else
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
