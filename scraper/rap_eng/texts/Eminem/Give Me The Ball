[Verse 1: Eminem]
My name is Chauncey Billups, I'm kind of like a raunchy Phillips
Screwdriver, my crew's liver when you can't sleep and you're still up
I get the ball and I'm like Rip, you can't get a grip
You probably got stripped, you wanna rumble, no reason to trip
I grab her like Gnarls Barkley holds the mic, your snarls spark me
I smile like Charles Barkley come on I'm hard, guard me
Ain’t booin’, ain’t pursuin’, no lawsuits, I ain’t suin’
I know what I’m doin’, give me the ball and your life is ruined
I'm like Rasheed, I remind me the spirit of Proof
I'm happy and lucky, ballin' and groovin', I'm on the move
I'm smooth with it, give me the ball, you don't know what to do with it
Shoot it in the basket, you other teams need a casket
LeBron sayin' don't respond, there's no back and forth
This game is mental, man, I play aloud and walk away just to hush the crowd
You trying to touch? Sit down

[Hook: Eminem]
Detroit basketball
Homie like I told you this is Detroit basketball
Man I don't think you ready for the

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I get the crowd rolled up Like a U-Haul truck
Just call me 2 Ball Chuck, ain't too tall what
I'll leave Utah stuffed
Man I love this game, who the hell you called up?
You need points on the paint, I'm the joints when they stained
All my coins in the bank and we're going all the way
Yeah baby it's true, I'm talking to you
You already know what to do
Just pass to me, it just so happens to be
That I adapt with this heat so strap in your seat
I got a grasp on this beat, you ain't convinced?
Give it to Tayshaun Prince, we haven't stayed calm since
Leave the ball with delayed palm prints

[Hook: Eminem]
Detroit basketball
Homie like I told you this is Detroit basketball
Man I don't think you ready for the

[Outro: Eminem]
We get everybody involved homie, we get everybody involved
I said we get everybody involved homie,we get everybody involved
Yeah
Ahh
I said ahh
Give me the ball
You gotta walk before you crawl
Tell me you ain't listenin
This is Detroit basketball Homie, hey yo
Beam me up Scottie
Hahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaa
