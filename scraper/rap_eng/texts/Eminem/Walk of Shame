[Hook]
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you gotta go that way
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you, but-but I wanna
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of (Shame)

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Six in the morning, don't even know your name
Even though I'm glad that you came, I'm sorry, but (you gotta go)
Instead of tryna parler, why don't you make
Like heaven's having a soiree? The party's up (You gotta go)
No disrespect to you, I just met you, you special but would you (gotta go)
And even though I feel you fly, my incidental bill's too high, sorry
Here, put my number in your phone so we can talk again
That walk to the lobby you got, we call that the walk of shame
I don't know what room Joey's in, or where's your friend
I don't know your friend, no offense but (you gotta go)

[Interlude]
Goodbye, muah

[Hook]
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you gotta go that way
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you, but-but I wanna
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of (Shame)

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
It all started when she stuck out her rear
Top bunk of the tour bus, she getting dug out up here
It felt like we could have hung out a year
But I was thinking with my dick, now bitch get the fuck out of here
I'm sorry that I did your girl reckless
I fed her a squirrel breakfast, she left with a pearl necklace
That big old ass had to be felt on
Or else itâ€™s just a waste like the space, I put my belt on
Now tell me what the hell is wrong
Fed with your ex, you get sex and get mailed home
Thugnificant tells em go that way
Then I send that bitch a smiley face (Bitches love a smiley face)

[Hook]
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you gotta go that way
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you, but-but I wanna
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of (Shame)

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Cab on speed dial, I ain't with devotion
Ain't buying what you're selling, nah, I ain't drinking the potion
Plan like anything slow motion
But a sweet baby Jesus when the frank's in the ocean
I don't know magic tricks, but you'll see plenty soon
Amazing how good one night stand in this empty room
She got gall, being the noise she had at breakfast
I tell her role play and be a voyeur with the exit
No, you don't get a key to the crib
You can be my wife for a hour get me in your rib but then you (gotta go)
And this party ain't unusual
She's sorry she came, I'm sorry it's not mutual

[Hook]
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you gotta go that way
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you, but-but I wanna
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of (Shame)

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Yeah, last night was fun, but that look like the sun
So yeah, last night is done and um (you gotta go)
I know, I'm sad too, don't forget your earrings
Oh, these ain't yours? My bad, but here's your bag, boo (You gotta go)
Your hair looks fine; I swear, your hair looks fine
Plus nobody care, you a dime but look at the time, girl (You gotta go)
I got shit to do but next time I'm in town you got my word
I'mma get with you, now where the fuck is this missing shoe? (You gotta go)
When I go in tour I find me a ho for sure
With open jaws and cute knees that both go on floors
Gina's and Pam's, I ain't tryna be Cole
But in the words of Martin: you ain't gotta go home but

[Hook]
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you gotta go that way
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you, but-but I wanna
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of (Shame)
