[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
Look, ain’t nobody have my back
When I needed em
So I turned to rap
And now they bleeding huh?
Run your mouth, it’s filled with crap
'When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
This that Em talk, I'm leading y’all
Watchu expect from a menace?
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearin' down your balcony
Yea I’m not perfection?
Welcome to my confession session
But you still getting hit
You crossed the line
Now I’m hiding my Jesus piece
And you gon’ get hit with ‘the piece’
And then we’ll be saying RIP
And in the end I’ll throw up the peace
Now do you know what that mean?
You ticked me off
So now you green
Killing rappers and beats, boost my self esteem
So you know what that mean?
The day I don’t murder ya
The bottom of your TV screen will read “longliveadamariz dead but is still the queen”

[Chorus]
I’m not afraid (I’m not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We’ll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you’re not alone
Holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Making these teens green like sheesh
I meant to say Shrek
I’m really making them scream
And I just deposited another check
Now i’m looking green oh
I just made ya turn pink
You’d think they were in a costume for Halloween
You look like a pig and you also stink
But I just been doing me and they be thinking the best that’s a bad thing
I mean yeah I used to do bad things but that was the old me
If you know you know I feel like Pusha T
Only one I trust is G-O-D
I been tryna get right with the King of Kings
Being careful what I sing
Watching who I bring along with me
Making sure they’re aren’t fake and leave
But they all do eventually
You see, everyone is capable of great things
Many mess up they blessing when they’re just teens doing ignorant things
Hanging with people who are filled with greed
Think I spoke on this before I’ll just let y’all be

[Chorus]
I’m not afraid (I’m not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We’ll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you’re not alone
Holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can’t keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I’m breakin' out of this cage
I’m standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I’m mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I’ve had enough, now I’m so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the valley
I was getting ready to call my sophomore year my finale
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a daughter
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my Fathers
And praise Him, you couldn't lift a single army on ‘em
‘Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to finally blow up
And I’ve been fastening up, never letting my guard down and telling His people to rise up
‘Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and all

[Chorus]
I’m not afraid (I’m not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We’ll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you’re not alone
Holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road
