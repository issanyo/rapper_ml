[Verse 1]
I told you niggas (gunshots)
The money don't make the man nigga, the man make the green
See me and P 'n' C nigga, we servin' all these fiends
Creamin', 'til our dreamin' nigga, millions of tops
I want the plot, the whole world, nigga, I want all my own spot, yachts
'Til I get it, get it, get it how I live
I'm a thug, one of them blood, nigga, I do it how I feel
Ain't no such thing as niggas, bein' halfway shook
I'm a mothafuckin' killa, hang with convicts and crooks (ha ha)
Nigga what? You don't wanna, go to war with us
Top down, on your block, nigga, fuck it (Now nigga what?!)
I hate to see you niggas wanna ride with us
Down dirty 'bout my skrilla and born killa (nigga what, I means)
See you niggas, be all about y'all green
I gotta gets my mad mail on, nigga what (cha-ching)
Beamin', fuck 'em, I stay leanin' in the Lex
Me and Master P 'n' C-Murder off in Texas
Fuck 'em, if them niggas, can't take a mothafuckin' joke
I'm a (mother) convict bitch, I run with killas that cut yo' throat
All about my, green, nigga, all about my, paper
On top, when we stop, 'til I'ma call shots of a skyscraper
See I don't gangbang, get my bang on, so bring it on bitch, I'm trife
Type of nigga that'll pull a plug on yo' life, ya better hangin' on
All them hoes wanna ride with some real niggas 'n thugs
Fuckin' bitches love the niggas, but we love to get our drugs
See I stay tight, usually riding late-night
Don't trip nigga, I'm deadly like a snake bite (hiss)
Fake ass Save-Mart, with yo' mothafuckin' fake ass heart
Nigga I'm known to get it rowdy (Ahhh!)
Oh yeah, that's my trademark
No-Limit soldiers, I ride with the killas
I'm a thug nigga, get above, you gon' feel us

[Hook]
I told ya man make the money
The money don't make the man
You could do what you want to, what you wanna do? (gunshots)
Let's dance
Man go make the money
The money don't make the man nigga
We can do it how you want to, what you wanna do? (gunshots)
We can dance

[Verse 2]
Look at him there, he got my money, so go 'head and drop it like a dime
And if you see me on the block, better go and stop like a sign
Now see, I'm always doin' silly things, nigga really things
See when I rap, its like a showdown, I use my whole nine's and gillitines
Holla at me bitch, I'm 'bout that money and the power bitch
Sour shit nigga drug deal, I kill all them cowards bitch
Now I make no mistakes, no, shit, I'm about makin' some dough
I'm a thug and bitch I don't love 'em, if I don't like 'em, I shake them hoes
Nigga don't talk shit, brag, nigga I sag like some titties
Now I don't let shit pass nigga, I peel you ass like a hickey (kiss) (gunshots)
I blast cause I'm fast, fast like a quickie
I'ma blast, but first I'ma ask, if you with me
Now all my real niggas, look, show me some love
And you know, I'm gonna get high, like a daze, show me the bud
Survive in any city, look just me the thugs
But if it gets outta hand, look P, just throw me some slugs
Pistols nigga shit, and a half a kit
Uptown 3rd ward, get that shit, and a half a day
Now I'm a hustla, should I say, a down south hustla
(?) to them niggas that fake, or should I say, niggas that bustas
Nigga need to retire, before I get they mouth full of wires
Should I damn near start a riot, shit you know, we on fire
See, what you meanin' nigga, 'bout, no bitches 'n blunts
Nigga I ride the day with olds, nigga, with six in the front
Bitch trip, shit nigga, you catchin' a slug
AK's to yo' mothafuckin' grill, I hold a grudge (gunshot)
I wanna dance, nigga, let's dance
Now if y'all wanna take a chance, nigga, then charge it to the game

[Hook]
See the man make the money
The money don't make the man
We could do what you want to, what you want do? (gunshots)
Nigga dance

The money don't make the man
We could do what you want to, what you want do? (gunshots)
We can dance

[Verse 3]
If you real, shit, I'm livin' the same as you
Nigga, No Limit soldier, bitch, what I claim, is true
I'm rowdy bitch, get on some rowdy shit (Ah!)
Look down south, east to the west, shit, nigga, everybody 'bout it bitch
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm like a (?)
I hold my own like a pit, but if I'm trippin'
Better miss, like to laugh a the game took a shot and you and didn't fuckin' hit it
Nigga I can't stop now, look like a nigga can't stop hoes
I'll let y'all get a chance to drop, nigga I'm about to drop mine, now look, the shop is closed
Nigga every verse on, I'm sayin' on the planet, everything I work on
You wanna know why I'm worth mills, on the real, look at the rhymes of the first song
See y'all niggas ain't ready (ready)
I hold my trigga finga steady (steady)
Nigga I'm hard to grip like spaghetti
I chop yo' ass like confetti
I bet it, look nigga, don't think the money'll change me
I'll fuckin' hang yo' ass like a hanga
But I ain't no gangbanga
Stop ass standin', y'all had chances, now what?
Percey you know who the man is
One less person that's standin'

[Hook]
