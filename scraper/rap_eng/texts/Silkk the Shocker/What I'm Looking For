Damn, it's mad shorty's up in here
I don't all them just one girl that can do it all
Yeah I feel what chu' say

(chorus 2x)
Now where them girls that be laid up, gettin' tanned on the beach
Right Here, Right Here
I like them them girls that be in shape and right in petite
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
I want a girl to be nice and real sexy
That's what I'm talkin' bout, Yeah Ma, You comin' wit me
Oh yeah, Oh yeah

(Verse One)
I like them wearin' G-Strings, The one's that let you see things
One's that call you on the phone, Just to let you hear things
Generous, willingly, giving, you know just wanna share things
Havin' competition, always wanting to compare things
Like mine is better than just doin' real things
Beautiful chicks and flicks who like to lick things
Colorful chicks with hips who like to grip things
Sneak you in the backdoor, Give you what chu' asked for
Sayin' ya name, lettin' you know that that's yours
Like the way we creep and duck, Love the way I beat it up
Like the way I speed it up, Just long as her feet is up
Not from the streets but have a that in her
Cute but thuggish like have a little brat in her
Show me when she learn stuff, No when to turn it up
Never fake, No it take, That's what I'm lookin' for

(chorus 2x)

(Verse Two)
Toe the censore, look her thighs is winter
Told her it was sky's the limit
And if her back was anything like rims, She'd be ridin' 20
Told her she gone look infinty, Plus she gone good in Bently's
Introduce her to the family, Sit next to me at the grammy's
Our life you gone be caked up, You just gone like to wake up
You wannna fight to make-up
Can't have em' like I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
I'm tall I'm like em' short to, where they come to my chest
And wit high heels, look, come to my neck
Got a lot of money in this world, I don't some of it
Got a lot of girls in this world, but look I only need one of em'
You know the girl who I choose her closet cuddled in furs
Friends like goddam, bitch look at her

(chorus 2x)
