[Silkk the Shocker]
Woke up one morning, hang over from last night
I was drunk as fuck plus I was throwin up
An my eyes was like hella tite
Waked up out my bedroom, nigga still reachin for a sack
I hads to make me some mail, so I stepped out the door
An fo' i did I went back an grabbed my... strap
I be whippin some shit, nigga gimme some shit
Nigga triplin some shit, nigga flippin some shit
You got some yayo, give it here
I triple that shit for only fifty percent
See bitch I be like Seven-Eleven, like the liquor store
Stop the car, dropped it out, nigga what y'all hittin fo'
Nigga, wassup, yeah I might man, keep it tight man
It be like Charles Barkley
I be hittin three four, all day in the dice game
Man, it's cool, but umm, some of these niggas be faulty
Game be salty, wanna run up on me, I'ma have to toss him
See y'all be trippin but I don't be slippin
Pop a clip in when I'm blastin an best believe I don't be missin
It's that nigga - wassup, playa, niggas get fucked
Playa haters get bucked, so wussup?
Bitch it be A, B, C, D, E
Yo the last letter be me, a straight G
I keep busters on they back, keep 'em flat that
Nigga, wassup, one-times'll try to check ya, I'm at that
Woke up this mornin, something didn't feel right
Look to my side cuz I felt some thighs
Musta been the girl I met at the club last night
I had to look twice, damn nigga, I was just like what?
Seen some drawers on the floor, and a condom on my dick
And I knew last night I musta fucked
