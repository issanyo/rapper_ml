[Woman]
The allegations of organized crime prime ties
What, what do you say to those people and those allegations
After all these years?

[Man]
Um this interveiw was not supposed to touch
On personalities or personal things
So I must ask you to forgive me for not answering you

[Silkk The Shocker]
(What what) What's on your mind
(What what) Let me know what's on your mind
(What what) Let me know what's on your mind
(Yup yup) What's on your mind
See you bout' makin' moves with dollar signs
Let me know, huh, let me know
Let me know, let me know, let me know

Look we come through sittin' on crome, you know how we roll
Anything we do, we ball outta control
Now see you can either leave or stay
You know how we play, look I'm a be alright either way
I ball till I fall, either touching 4-6
Touchdown, what now, hold the clip
Silkk The Shocker in this bitch with my cuz n shit
See what's on your mind, we ain't nothing but some thugs n shit
What?

[Mo B. Dick]
You lookin' like you gotta atittude
Why must you be so rude
Cuz I see right through you
It's just a front that you be putting on
When you be all alone
I know you wanna bone
I'll be the freak that taped inside of you
Buy you new ties and shoes
And what you gonna do
Why don't you tell me how you really feel
You got to keep it real
Tell me what's to do

Chorus
Tell me what's on your mind
Do you like what you see
Are you interested in me
Can you please tell me what's on your mind
Do you like what you see
Are you coming home with me
Can you please tell me what's on your mind

Have you ever seen a woman like you, baby
So sexy and so beautiful, thought off and confused
Girl it's up to you, if you don't or if you do
Girl it really doesn't matter, but I don't have the time girl
Oh to make you mine girl
You know you want me

Chorus

[Silkk The Shocker]
Mo B. Dick, Silkk The Shocker
Dirty south, make the round
Tell me what's on your mind?
