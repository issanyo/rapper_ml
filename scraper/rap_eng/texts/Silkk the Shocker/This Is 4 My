[Intro: Freedom]
Look alive, recognize, my man Shocker
Money, power, fame, ya know I'm saying, whatever
But listen, who you really do this for Shocker?
Tell 'em what you really do this for

[Verse 1: Silkk the Shocker]
This for my thug niggas (Huh), what, my drug dealers
From the pound to mix around, hard to give you a hug niggas
For my key and a half niggas
Facing 10 but took a plea for 3 and a half niggas
For niggas who look the four corners, sit in the dark
Ghetto shit, ghetto niggas, the ones that spit when they talk
Shit, nigga put shots, better believe they be hitting your heart
I can't stop, come on, everything that I drop
What they doing? Hitting the charts
This for the real, the fake I just can't respect y'all
This for the one with the 3 hearts in the cut
Only use the phone to make collect calls
This for my real niggas that be holding they ground
In the middle of the projects, come on, still holding it down
For my Thurston House niggas
The triple beam niggas
The ones that scheme niggas
To get the cream niggas
I mean the ones by any mean niggas
The ones that keep it real, yeah, that keep the steel
Always survive, gotta ride nigga, creep to chill
To all my East niggas, my West niggas
My South niggas, my North niggas
The ones with no heart niggas
The ones that set it off from start niggas, come on
The ones like me, that's popping in the game
If you tell 'em once, they ain't listening
I come back, and I'm popping them things
The ones who put lies in they names, so hit the block
See that biggest nigga, tell that, yo, nigga you gotta raise up off the spot
You got 'til 12 o'clock to raise up
Goodbye or I'm coming back with the gauge up
For all my niggas that be like Silkk's my dawg
For all y'all niggas that be hating, I be like fuck all y'all
This for my niggas

[Chorus: Freedom & Silkk the Shocker]
This my motherfucker, ya heard me?
Yeah, Shocker, Shocker, Shocker, yeah
Free, free, free
What? Huh? Huh? Huh?

[Verse 2: Silkk the Shocker]
This for niggas like P, I mean niggas like C
Niggas down the bars, niggas that's down to ride for me
I put in your chest, put in your vest, put you to death
I don't give a fuck, I feel like I'm a second from my last breath
Nigga fuck, I mean
This is for my niggas who gotta like, pay they rent
Before, they just reach in they pocket and all they see is lint
This for my niggas

[Chorus: Silkk the Shocker & Freedom]
Y'all know this for my niggas
This for my, this for my niggas
This who I do it for, this for my, this for my, keep it moving
Yeah, my real niggas and my real bitches
Keep it moving, y'all
Keep it moving, y'all
This for my, this for my

[Verse 3:  Silkk the Shocker]
This for my niggas who be thugging, my niggas who be struggling
My niggas who be hustling, all my dawgs, I don't care which color
This for my real niggas, my ill niggas, my trill niggas
My niggas who down and dirty, the ones who get it how they live niggas
My niggas with little dough, like T and Little Joe
Want to congratulate ya, don't hate ya, 'cause ya got a little more
For my No Limit niggas, my project niggas
My out there niggas (Where my niggas at?)
Respect that nigga (Where my niggas at?)
This for my balling niggas, my shot calling niggas
All my niggas, especially my New Orleans niggas
This is for my rowdy niggas, my bout it niggas (Bounce!)
Silkk the Shocker live, (Shocker live nigga) nigga
Audi nigga (Shocker live nigga)
