[Silkk The Shocker]
Yall wanna get bout it bout it then bounce to the track
Im from the south, so no doubt I gotta bounce with that
I get paid off the way I, pronounce my rap
Used to keep my money in brown bags
Now I got accounts for that
Yo, I bounce like a 6-4
Im out to get dough
I spend some, I lend some, but im out to get mo'
Now hit the club cuz im in some club shit
Ima thug on some thug shit
Nigga wanna fight cuz they dont like im the one they baby made love wit
Im the type to get in the club wit
Niggas trippin on that, we bout that money and power
No Limit ridas, and we dont be fuckin wit cowards
Thats why we spend so much money on jewls
Thats why we spend so much money on shoes
Man im like "fuck, I got so much I could spend it on food"
Now when I step in this bitch from the front to the rear my niggas
Where my TRU niggas at?? (Right here my nigga!!)

[Chorus]

[Big Ed]
Where all my thugs niggas?
38 snub nose it's the slugs nigga
Niggas Peepin, I ain't trippin, im lookin like WHAT?! nigga
I got my vest on
Big Ed the Assass-on
Quick to get my blast on
So Fuck it, im switchen from cop-knuckers to suckers that swallow nuts DAMN
Niggas better not make act a fool and lay this whole club down
Theres always one nigga, but ima ballroom balla
(???)
What the fuck
Niggas lookin all struck
I paste hatas like Glock papas and leave em all stuck
Leave the woman all fucked
Sick real drama
Im in the bucked worry
Ya Momma -- I fucked over

[Chorus]
