[Intro: Silkk The Shocker]
Yo Mya
I know you got a man and all
But uhh I been watchin yall
And if he ain't treatin you right
'bout time you move on
Now I'm not trying to get in between yall two
But you gonna move, move this way

[Verse 1: Mya]
I'm so confused
I don't know what to do (gonna be aiight, gonna be aiight)
But I gotta be a woman
I gotta get over you (yeah aiight, yeah aiight)

I think I saw your baby's mother
Creeping at your back door (Yeah-ee Yeah-ee)
And your lying ass been cheatin
And I can't take it no more oh oh

[Chorus: Mya]
I'm movin on (move on)
On
(movin on)(and move my way)
On
(movin on-on) (move on)
Oh-on
I'll be movin on (and move my way, say what say what)
(2x's)

[Verse 2: Mya]
Whose drawers are these
You know I wear a size four (huh what, say what)
And if you say that you've been faithful
Who was at your back door

You ain't got no money ( it don't matter about all that, I got some)
I should've left you long ago (Yea-ee Yea-ee Yea-ee)
And your stroke ain't strokin no more
So I've been sleepin all alone
(she shouldn't have to sleep by herself you know what I'm sayin)
If you know what I mean

[Chorus]
I'm movin on (move on)
On
(movin on)(and move my way)
On
(movin on-on) (move on)
Oh-on
I'll be movin on (and move my way, say what say what)
(2x's)

[Verse 3: Silkk The Shocker]
Well now I'm a No Limit Soldier
Known to keep it rowdy
You know, ones that make em say "ugggh"
And "'bout it 'bout it"
Now one to the two
Two to the three
I ain't sayin' leave him
But you need to like roll wit me
Cause I can see you ain't happy here
When I look in your eyes
You a bird
You gotta spread your wings
So now it's time to fly
You ain't never gotta trip
Or remind me
I'm trying to live ghetto fab
Like takin' baths
In bottles of Dom P
But I ain't perfect
Cause imagine me with no flaws
Like a parking lot with no cars
Cell block with no bars
World with no wars
L.A. with no stars
Check this out: I can heal your broken heart
So don't be so fast
To react so quick
Or get all mad
And try to scratch up my 6
Now you know I get paid
For bustin' all kind of tight verses
See I need a girl
That I can see on top
Like Silkk and Mya
Or vice versa

[Chorus] (w/o I'll be movin on)
