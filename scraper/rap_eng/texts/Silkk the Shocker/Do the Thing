[Chorus]
Mami you so fly, you know I can't lie
You wanna know why, just do the damn thing
Your body's perfect, move it like a sure thing
Go ahead and work, just do the damn thing
Let's get some privacy, you getting V.I.P
It's just you and me, just do the damn thing
Let's get it cracking, let's make it happen
No distractions, just do the damn thing

[Silkk the Shocker]
She's fly she's fine, let me mark up my check list
Um not dinner, but let's talk about breakfast
And I ain't really came, to talk bout my necklace
Look let's walk for a second, my car parked by the exit
Let's go or let's stay, whatever it is let's play
I know you wan' do it, cause I can see through like a x-ray
I'm a lil' hood, you looking real good
I know I probably shouldn't, but I probably still would
You came strictly here, for entertainment
So come on a lil' closer, let's get a lil' acquainted
I got a couple of questions, just tell me the answer
I wanna see you move that thang, like a belly dancer
I could be blunt, since we all cool
I could teach you a lil' some'ing, even though we ain't in school
They wanna know where I get all this money from, a couple of records
I'll give you a couple of mill, 'fore I give you a couple of seconds
That mean money ain't shit, that mean my time is precious
I ain't came for no chit-chat this and that, no time for no lectures
Look if this was a game, I'd be up one
Told her I'm not blunt, it's just that I'm up front
Told her think about the change, and ma I'm up front
I told her I'm out I'm up one, let's go shorty

[Chorus]
[Silkk the Shocker]
See I'm watching her, while she watching and grinning
Watching my watch, watching how my watch be spinning
Her man mad watching me, so I'm watching my back
You heard the watch that I said, I got more watch than that
See I just stop and chat, you know stop with they acts
Tell her a lil' some'ing now sit back, and watch her react
I'm trying to get her from bar to the car, then back to the crib
From the crib back to the car, then back to where she live
See um, so I'm trying to see what's up with you lady
I'm trying to see what's up with you now, not what's up with you later
(what's up with you playa), just trying to see what's up with baby
So kill, I'm just gon' have to get up with you later
Naw, today is the day I'm trying to get it jumping
Um, by the night I'm trying to get into something
Ma when it come to money, you know I'm caked
And um you grown, so you have no problem going home late
But this dude, talking all loud in my ear
Trying to slip me a demo, look that's not why I'm here
So playa, can you move back
I'm not Stella, but I just came to get my groove back yeah

[Chorus]
