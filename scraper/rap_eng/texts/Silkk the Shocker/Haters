Yo Samm
These niggas can either love us or hate us
Nothin' in between that
In or out ya hear me

[Hook]2x's
Haters (Haters)
What you ain't heard the tank don't stop (We don't stop)
Ain't nobody fuckin' with this (Scream nigga)
No Limit No Limit (What)

[Samm]
Now how the fuck you gon' stop a tank
Tryin' to deny the bank
We comin' through with them choppers choppin' and not a shank
Mac say's World War III
Beware on all streets
We got Glocks takin' care of all beef
Fuck fair and all peace
We tried that shit
Tryin' to hide you bitch and stay inside and shit
But we kickin' down doors
Spittin' rounds for
Them fake motherfuckaz stop hatin' motherfuckaz
Only thing you need hot is bullets and fuck you girl
No Limit Soldiers comin' fuckin' up you world
Ain't nobody fuckin' with it
And you can trust that
Niggas stoppin' the tank
Look motherfuck that

I can't believe they ain't heard about
Them boys from the Dirty South
I speak with awkward slang plus I got a dirty mouth
So I'ma stay in this bitch till I get my shit tight
I'm tryin' to be the only nigga to ever get 6 mics
I tell them slow down nigga y'all just sit tight
It's all about triple platinum in this bitch
6 hits ain't right
I see them niggas
Look besides they fake
Number one fans
They get around they boys they try to hide the tape
Ah, you know when I slide in the place
Look at these haters
Look at they eyes and they face
They like them niggas ain't hip-hop enough
They from the South
Got too many gold teeth in they mouth
Them boys country they too rowdy
Plus they too bout it
But we don't give a fuck
We bout to run 2000
So I'm like PLAYAS - get money
And y'all HATERS - get's nothin'
