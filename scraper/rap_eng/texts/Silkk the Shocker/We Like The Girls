(Girls)
Ya boy Shocker in the building
(We like dem girls)
Heads remain anonymous
He ain't gotta be obvious
(We gotta have them girls)
Ladies, if y'all thirsty, drinks on me
(We like dem girls, girls, girls, girls)
And you fake ballers, you know what to do

And y'all haters
Be gone, want, want want
Be gone, want, want want
Be gone, want, want want, be gone

You get money, then take it to the floor
You got game, then take it to the floor
You ain't scared, then take it to the floor
You came to party, then take it to the floor

Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank god
I don't know but last night seemed kinda odd
The spot was hot, the place was packed
They had fat asses wall to wall and back to back

Imagine that, it was a hell of a scene
Either that or it was a hell of a dream, ya heard me
They had a few ballers but not that many
A lot of model-type chicks but not that skinny

I mean one in particular caught my eye
I mean she gave me a look when I walked by
Like, "Yeah, we about to have some fun here"
Her mouth ain't move but her body sayin' come here

So I passed the key
And got a hotel suite like Cassidy
And Kel, so I yell let's blaze the party
And something started up and it sounded like Atari

Shorty tell me what your name is?
Drea tell me what your game is?
Shorty tell me why you came here?
Drea show me what ya workin' with?

Girls, we like dem girls
We gotta have them girls
We like dem girls, girls, girls, girls

Now the hardest decision I gotta make
Which girl am I humping today?
Petey Pablo done jumped back in the game
Got the world freek-a-leakin' like they insane

Liftin' their skirts, showing me thangs
Liftin' their shirts, lettin' them hang
How they made they booty bounce to a beat these days
It's like Luther Vandross song "So Amazing"

Ugh, ugh, ugh ain't that crazy
Hey Silkk I think I got something on my hand
This girl wilder than the Taliban
I'ma bout leave here, take her to a lion's gate

On the back floor, I'm a jury mate
Don't worry 'bout the room, I got maids
Ain't price any cheaper, I got paper

See me and these boys came to act a fool
The New No Limit, we don't play by the rules
I came to party, not to clap the game
Get C out of jail 'cuz it's time to get paid

Up and down and I ain't talkin' 'bout waves
I'm in the Bently getting my head done
And I ain't talking bout braids

Girls, we like dem girls
We gotta have them girls
We like dem girls, girls, girls, girls

I'm country mayne, I'll punch ya brain
I'll roll wit boys that'll pluck ya mayne
You get money, you better tuck ya mayne
The haters out here, they'll cut ya mayne

Get loose with it,stay true with it
We don't want it if you let Bruce Bruce hit it
Get loose with it, stay true with it
We don't want it if you let Bruce Bruce hit it

Her neck, her back
We can fix it in my Lac
Her neck, her back
We can fix it in my Lac

Girls, we like dem girls
We gotta have them girls
We like dem girls, girls, girls, girls

Shorty I'ma get with you
But like Chingy I'm only one call away
I mean I'ma baller take that away
I'll call you
