Uh-huh, yo let me get some of that man
Look, I think I can fuck something
I'm tryin' to find out what's up with you
See, for real
What-what

[Chorus]
Seem like a thug to me
You know I like what I see
Can you see yourself creepin' with a girl like me
I like it rough on the hush so nobody won't see
Repeat

[Verse 1]
You say you like it thuggish
I'm as thug as it gets
I see you checkin' me out when I pull up with the clique
I seen the others but I'm like yo what's up with this chick
Sized you up by the slightest ? touchin' yo hips
See that's my big brother yep I learned the game from him
So whatever I give to you look the same to yo friend
You know I stay thugged out the second I came in
Meet me again you could but look the chance is slim
And if you got a problem with yo man
We can put the gat to him
Got a boyfriend tonight
If it's done right then you won't go back to him
See I knew you was tryin' to find where the dollars at
If you feel how I feel and it's real then holla back

[Erica Fox]
Boy I want you
I'm diggin' on yo thugged out style
You know you got it
Up in the club drivin' me wild
Boy I gotta have it
So you can tell me what's up for tonight baby
But keep it on the hush

Chorus

[Verse 2]
{girl}Why you clockin' me?
{silkk}Look like you jockin' me
{girl}Why you jockin' me?
{silkk}Look like you watchin' me
Why you sweatin' me?
Look like you hot to me
Tell you like this
Once I start ain't no stoppin'
We start this thang off by a shoppin' spree
You still be messin' with them lame girls if not for me
You know I'm the type to attract drama
And I'm probably not the type you can bring home to mama
But look I told ya
It's No Limit
Girl I'm a soldier
So roll with it
Fuckin' with you so look hit me up
Here's my number on the under later I'm pickin' you up
For real

Chorus 2x's
