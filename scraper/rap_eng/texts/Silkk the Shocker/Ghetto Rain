[Master P]
Picture this, any man that hustle because like to is a fool
Any man that hustle because he got to feed his family....
That's a real man.nYou see I hustle because I got feed me family
I got families to feed, I got feed my mama
I got to feed big mama, I got to feed my cousin
I got to feed my lil' brother, I got to feed my sister
I got to feed my kids, I got to feed my people

[Chorus]
The ghetto's got me hustlin' tryin' to survive
The ghetts got me hustlin' tryin' to stay alive
The ghetto get me hustlin' tryin' to survive
And I know I'm goin' to hustle until the day I die

[Master P]
UUGGHH!!!
It's da black rain to da moon and tears that cause lies
See that's the way I felt when my lil' brother died
And some fools say it ain't no justice
And other niggas say it ain't no peace
That's why thugs help their on these projects and on these streets
See my daddy made me a dealer
And my cousin made me killer
See that's why everything we do, they gonna respect us and feel us
And I'm still tryin' to understand why big daddy was with da rest
And my nephew on the last counter on da 14th down the car reck
It ain't muthafucker down on dope, on crack, or aids
And I see so many ghetto people go to jail
And live your life and die like slaves
I got a relative on apeel doin' 25 flat
On murder or ride nigga fuck it Johnny Cochran can't fight that
And since I'm black and I'm rich
They see to overlook It's me advise
First class niggas tryin' call da police tryin' to book us
Ain't that a bitch, I done made millions
And still goin' through a thang
That's niggas ask me P why the fuck you never change

[Chorus]

[Silkk The Shocker]
It's like I'm rich and poor
I open the world and slang dop
It's the world changes knowand changes I thorp
I thank all my big brothers with out him I wouldn't made it through
So with life on line put all up 4 him so I put that shit on TRU
The ghetto got me caught up, no broken dreams
The ghettos trap, I see some on crack, and dope fiends
My hommie, Never did no crime but lien' up in the hearse
Thank god 4 all that I got from that times can be wrorst
Ever feel like u was swimming, and really was dronin'
You ani't wanna smile but your tender smile always see me clownin'
I trade my life to make the world better
Trade everything I got including life
To bring back my brother Kevin
See I spit the realist shit
Tryin' make yo'll feel this shit
Yo'll tryin' put the finger on our side
Livin' middle bricks livin' this shit
See I tell you everybody use to ride benzes
But we had to ride buggies
Mom wanted better things for me
But private school was way past our budget
So if I'm  happy and I'm smilin' and I'm camouflage my problems
The only way I can really solve them
If I really grab and revolve them
So I grab it and I cocked it
I was going to pop it
But I stop, forgot I was rich
What everybody not rich
Every month so close to gettin' no profits
My only hustle, I told them to stop it
But can't really knock it
Everybody died up in game
Everybody tryin' to maintain
Wall from out da ghetto
Close my eyes and still see the pain
Sometimes I just get fed up
To all my souljas worldwide
I know its hard to stride
Keep your head up!

[Chorus x2]
