[Intro: Master P]
Yo Snoop, you and Silkk remember that shit called dumb girl?
Well check this shit out, I got one called thug girl
Ha ha ha ha

[Chorus]
I'm looking for a thug girl
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at
I'm looking for a thug girl
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at
Where they at

[Master P]
I heard you jocking Master P cause he got a Mercedes
And you wanna be his lady and probably have his baby
You just wanna ride and get inside
So yall can roll around town like Bonnie and Clyde
But we don't trip we just pack that heat
How many thug nigga bitches wanna ride with me

[Chorus]
Thug girl
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at
I'm looking for a thug girl
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at

[Snoop Dogg]
Hey yo P, trip, these hollywood hoes is cute
But they braids is ?????, I don't know
I'd rather fuck with a thug girl
Cause they're minus some steady, so here we go
I had one named Valore she owned a clothes store
And she wanted to roll with a nigga like me on tour
I said look here girl, are you so sure
And she said Doggy Dogg, there's nothing I want more
Your the best thing I ever had
I wanna love you forever and make you my babies dad
I ain't mad but I ain't glad
Besides, I rise a bitch and I can't be had
She wanted to take the ring off my finger
So I slapped the bitch up like we was on Jerry Springer
I had to teach her cause she loved to tangle
Don't you know that thug girls love gangbangers
I'm looking for a thug girl

[Master P]
I'm looking for a thug girl
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at
I'm looking for a thug girl
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at
I'm looking for a thug girl
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at

[Silkk The Shocker]
They wish they knew why a girl like you
Would do all the things that you do
But they should understand that you our biggest fan
And you don't wanna sweat, you wanna thug for a man
Now every nigga need a thug girl and miss your mine
I wrote this rhyme just for your kind
Now you the flyest girl up in the whole place
Cause you walk around with that thug look on your face
Now since I'm a thug I keeps it cocked back
Ain't no love I'm a thug nigga and real thug girls jock that

[Master P]
Thug girl
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at
I'm looking for a thug girl
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at, where they at
A down south thug girl
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at, where they at
A west coast thug girl
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at, where they at
An east coast thug girl
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at, where they at
A midwest thug girl
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at, where they at
I'm looking for a thug girl
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at, where they at
