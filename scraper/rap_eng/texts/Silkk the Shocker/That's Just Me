(*talking*)
XL the beat is sick nigga, look

[Chorus]
When I pull up on the block, that's just me
Rims spinning when I stop, that's just me
Top off when it's hot, that's just me
Do what I do if you not, then that's just you

[Silkk the Shocker]
They say the streets is listening, so look tell em come a lot closer
No I'm not boasting, even though I pull up in a drop Roadster
Dog if not bout paper, I'm not concerned
If you ain't made it yet, then it's not your turn
I'm trying to put do' in, and have stocks in return
Y'all playing with the game, sit back watch what I earn
I use to rock all white P. Millers, till the blacks came out
They say Shock you the hottest thang in the hood, since crack came out
See if you ain't been know me, don't even bother dog
And if it ain't about no bis', don't even bother to call
Y'all wanna pull guns out, pose model y'all
If it ain't work for you nigga, why the fuck would I follow y'all
Know if it's real, if I ever heard y'all pull one out
Got em like bullies outside, they don't even wanna come out
I'm sneaky, I do stuff right under they noses
And even when I'm in the streets, the heat up under my clothes
I never slip when I'm sleep, the heat under my robe
And they like (Shocker you so young), but my money is old
If you know me, you know I never joke
And I ain't trying to convince you I'm rich, I'm trying to convince you I'm broke

[Chorus]
When I pull up on the block, that's just me
Rims spinning when I stop, that's just me
Top off when it's hot, that's just me
Do what I do if you not, then that's just you
Might wild out at the spots, that's just me
Getting blinded by my rocks, that's just me
Your girl see me and she jock, that's just me
Do what I do if you not, then that's just you

[Silkk the Shocker]
You better watch what your man say, cause he can get it
Even though I look like I'm cool, by giving him a handshake
Come through the country club, making the land shake
My neighbors try and kick me out, say I always mess up they landscape
I come through wilding, wake up the damn place
I don't know how to cook, but Shocker sure can bake
This gon' be, one of the best summers
I promise you, I will put up Kevin Garnett numbers
I stay fly, and I ain't got time
The way I drop dimes, you would swear I was A.I
Cars I lose that, look get a dozen
Shorty ain't acting right, lose that get her cousin
See I'm nothing like these dudes, who got guns that don't blast
More like a strict teacher, the grades ain't right you don't pass
If the joke ain't funny, whoadie I don't laugh
I'm real, I don't talk about nothing I don't have

[Chorus]
(*scratching*)
