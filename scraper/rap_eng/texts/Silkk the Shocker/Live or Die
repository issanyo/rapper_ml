[Master P]
Master P and Treach, nigga
It's all family baby
Get them Naughty boys, I got the No Limit Soldiers
And when we posse up, these niggas gon' pay us

[Refrain: Phiness and (Mystikal)]
I thought I told you, have my money
(Whatcha wanna do nigga)
You got until sunrise, or lose your life
(Whatcha gonna do nigga)
We comin with them thangs, and we ready to ride
(Where they at, let's get 'em)
Are you ready to die
Live or die, live or die, live or die
(Where they at, let's get 'em)

[Vinnie]
With a little bit of taste of the bass to the face
In the place for anybody not paying on time
Rather be up in a six foot cell
Before I let another nigga get flagrant with mine
And we be taking all cash, no checks, so go cancel this
I know niggas are so scandalous
The ones I bust I'mma show em nuff ? on how many people
Thinking that they can stand with this, shit
I thought somebody told you, boy
Them Naughty niggas ain't no toys
You're fucking with sixteen styles over sixteen bars
Sixteen car man entourage
And when we get things started, I'm the hardest artist
Styles I flips retarded
Family who can handle this
From Illtown to S.E. to Los Angeles

[Refrain]

[Treach]
Hear the tale, of the n'Illtown O.G., better know me
Shape the gold teeth, CD be, bring the clip shells
And Olde E and gats, so no one gets close to me
And down to scrap, raise em from that
True tradition, raise 'em up and gangsta bitches
That'll blaze them butts, don't play for fuck
Now we had a dealer knock off joints, Julie's jacking
With the drop-off point, yo, what the deal nigga
You backed out, I fucking witnessed it
And have partners have to split shit with
Nah, pay me now, bust it
At sundown see I went on work
I sent a tec mount in a tennis skirt, pop the blood claat
Watch a thug rock, slugs pop
With every cop on the block, with double-eye on my mugshots
He better pay me like he postin bail
Or send his hand with no nails to his mom in the mail

[Refrain]

[Mystikal]
Don't look now but I'm back
Now give me all my props again
I gotta kick your motherfucking ass for steppin on my mocassins
We blended with Treach and Vinnie from Naughty By Nature
It's Mystikal with Silkk the Shocker and them
No Limit Lieutenant is at it again
Catch me in the studio, tappin in from it, actin bad with a pen
No blacking, no ant-dragging, no babbling
I'm grabbing the mic in the booth when they peak
I'mma gonna get me started wrassin'
Turning and tussling
Clutching and muscling
I saw myself the demons when I'm busting them
If you wanna live you wouldn't fuck with them
Don't fuck with them

[Silkk the Shocker]
Ha hah, don't fuck with them, look
Nigga, I keep a tight show, Luciano type dough
Feature Al Capone's way out nigga, I got that type of flow
Don't floss, if it ain't yours
See we a bunch of feature artists, y'all a bunch of and mores
Get the picture like Van Gogh, plus they done banned our tours
Catch me gettin my floss on walking 'cross marble tan floors
Can't even touch the flow, can't even touch no coat
Bitch I'm made now, I can't even much touch no mo'
Fuck the whole rap game up nigga just, one of my lines
Say y'know a nigga like me, you're lying bitch
Cause I'm like one of a kind
From the Jerz to the five-oh we get down and dirty ya heard
I gotta eat, so I gotta go to street, cop two keys and a bird
So y'all better have what you owe me, by sundown
Or else I'mma get Mystikal, Naughty By Nature, my boys and 'nem
We gonna get y'all!
