I got nu-thin to lose (ungh!)
Pass me a ski mask, a Glock, and my tennis shoes
I got nu-thin to lose
Pass me a ski mask a Glock, and my tennis shoes (ungh!)

Chorus: Mercedez

You need to get, your life together
(hit em up, get em up, stick em up)
South money and hustlin, don't last forever
(Hit em up, get em up, stick em up)
Some say that G's make the world go round
(hit em up, get em up, stick em up)
You say you got nothin to lose, but who got a back when ya down?
(Hit em up, get em up, stick em up)

[Master P]
Man, I'm bout it, bout to get rowdy
I ain't even trippin if y'all fools doubt me
Penetentiary chances, I done danced with it
Died and went Hell, came back, down to do whatever
Hit em up (hit em up) stick em up, pick em up
I hope ya got insurance on ya brand new truck
Mama need food in the icebox
And I need some new Jordan with some white sock
Bout to rob Peter, to pay Paul
The ghetto got me crazy, but I won't fall
On my way to Arizona, got it sewed up
Down South with the task all on it *sirens*
Bout to put five in the stash box
Called the C-Murder up for them plastic Glocks
Beeper ringin, Silkk forgot the neck on some chicken
Cristal, parlay with Beck, gettin riches
No longer, livin in condos
It's mansions and fifty inch windows
Marble floors, tailor made suits
Lex Luthor, Ferraris, windows be bulletproof
Me work a nine to five, fool I like the good life
Seen mama so much, she slapped my face cause I ain't livin right
Me give it up, I get rowdy
Grabbed the gat, hit the street and the highway, I'm bout it, bout it

Chorus

[Silkk the Shocker]
I gots, nuthin to lose, I'm on the run like The Fugitive
My spot kinda hot, so I can't go where I used to live
Me and P ridin dirty, in the Yukon
Bout to get caught in due time, different place every state a new crime
Grab a ski mask and two nines, say money make the world go round
From out between the knocks I lets em in
Can't lose, gotta win, false move, end up in the pen
How many I kill goin for the cash
Dude, I gotta do it for the stash
Fill the getaway car up with gas, with the smash
Whatever we make, P, we goin in half
A nigga sex money and greed, costs of livin lavish
Hey I'ma get ya for what you got
If you ain't got it, act like you don't have it
I grab my gun before I grab my shoes
Everything on the line, so I can't lose
Man, look, you know Silkk, you know I'm bout to act a fool
So I'm a be gon away like a breeze
Run through like, all type of trees
I ain't gon stop til the cops say freeze, I can't lose

[Master P]
I got nuthin to lose
Pass me a ski mask, a Glock, and my tennis shoes

Chorus

[Mercedez]
We're in it deep, and we're in it to win it
(hit em up, get em up, stick em up)
In other words, there ain't no stoppin No Limit
(hit em up, get em up, stick em up)
Master P, Mercedez, T-R-U
(hit em up, get em up, stick em up)
After them, dead presidents, cause we have nuthin to lose
(Hit em up, get em up, stick em up)
