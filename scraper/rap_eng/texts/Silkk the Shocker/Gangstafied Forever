Gangstafied forever, forever
Gangstafied, ya ya ya ya ya

[Kane & Abel]
Whats up to all my people, Kane and Abel is back
Down south hustlers, soldier haters and jealous busters got me strapped
Got bigger paper now so I gotta bigger gat
Slangers and head busters ride burbans and lacs
Please, every brass for the tank love (ya heard me)
Cause soldiers respect soldiers and soldiers respect thugs
Like Slim say, hundred ground drum in the AK
If you dont respect the rap sheet, we don't play
Got fand in Japan who love this ghetto rap
Got to holler at Master P cause he put us on the map
Kane on attack, won't you let me hear the click clack
Represent your war stay hard soldiers in combat

[Silkk The Shocker]
I'm a G-A-N-G-S to the A (gangsta)
I'm a gangsta ass nigga, huh I dont play
Don't make me act a motherfuckin fool
I couldn't get a job I had to settle for robbing niggas I got too many
Tattoos
That's how I slug my drugs at, hang where my thugs at
Give a fuck on niggas stay real, you stay real, you gotta love that

[Mr. Serv-On]
I'm a G to the A to the N to the S to the T to the F to the I to the E to
The D
You know the S to the E to the R to the V always ready to cock to the
Glock
Niggas drop to the pop, nigga this tank block
Pushin that ass to the four to the O, niggas know this N.O
So feel my pain niggas know the game
Down with Kane & Abel a hundred G's on the T to the A to the L to the A

[Kane & Abel]
I hit the block gat cocked down to do some thangs
Talkin bout the white change, we can move some thangs
Mr. Abel Mr. Kane remain TRU to the game
Decked out on the cut with the platinum frame
Meet me at the motel choppin way on the scale
Caught the dirty ghetto mail on this highway to hell
Wo wo, the po po's kick down the door
Caught the cash yay low now they searchin for more
No peace in the city where the soldiers dwell
Fifteen years old war stories to tell
Well
