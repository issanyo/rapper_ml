[Master P]
I got five on the trizzay, today is a gizzay
Jumped in my Chev on the way to the dizzay
And I'm a ring ding dong like Dre
But I'm strapped with that tre 8
So much pound in my back seat
I'm gettin chased by those motherfuckers O P D
Should I hit a condo and lose the bottle
Fuck it I hear today cause I never been a role model
I'm out for the dough taz on my back
Shake the po po's, never did time for crack
This young playa, I don't play
Got more bitches then oil of olay
But I'm smooth like gladness, hustlin is a habit
Spinach for Popeye, fool I like cabbage

[Big Ed]
[Hook]
Can tell by you walk and the way that you talk
Youz a TRU playa x2

[Silkk]
It be the, it be the, it be the S-I-L to the K
The nigga that you love to hate, but these hoes, yep, they love to date
Mom trippin goin have to get yours
Stumblin and fallin as I tip toe
Now watch me jump and pimpin this system for what it's worth
I got so many ways but like first thing's first
Now let's see if you can catch this
Bouncin, leanin, smashing the Lexus
I'll be a playa and you know I'm TRU
I got them G's on my side and you know how us G's do
Another day, another dollar
I'm not a scholar cause I didn't graduate
Share my school I get a paycheck
You know I'm always flossin
Can't be keepin them niggas up on they toes, pimpin these hoes
I'm better off in, in the car that's what they told me
I'm a soldier, down with this No Limit click like I told ya

[Big Ed]
Chorus x2

[King George]
The money comes slow, the money go fast
Playas like TRU stash cash in the garbage bag
Every day, all day, time to roll bread
C.O.B. on the spot, how we get paid
AK's fully strapped in the backpack
King George, like the mack in the white Lac
Bumper jack intact, time to step back
Guinea pigs in the crowd get thier head cracked

[Mr. Serv-On]
Here I come again on the straight coming
The S to the S to the E to the E to the R to the R to the V to the O to
The N
It's all about his dividends
And I ain't hesitant
In 95 I changed my residence to make bigger presidents
Never been a kid like Jason
On and off the court I'm pimpin them hoes like Gary Payton
Eyes red like Satan
High from that dank
Straight from the city to give two nuts about a body on stank
So nick nack paddywhack, P pass a sack or pass a dack game
Trippin off a nickel sack of weed
Been pushin hella weed since I jumped out my daddys nut seed
So ain't no use in failing green like Sam Sneed
So when you see me you might as well count your stack
Respect what I jack and let me show you what you lack
And treat you how a real playa supposed to act
Cause I'm a real TRU playa

[Big Ed]
Chorus x2

[Big Ed]
See I'm a G to be a playa, a playa to be a G
It's the B to the I
[Silkk]
And what you be?
[Big Ed]
I be a G
[Silkk]
And what do people call you?
[Big Ed]
Some people call me E
[Silkk]
And what you used to slang?
[Big Ed]
I used to slang that D
See I add flavor to this cut like jalapeno bro
See I'm hotter then tobasco ho, flowin fast or slow
Cause yall be roll up through them cuts
Runnin or rust, got that Glock cocked ready to pop
Let off seventeen hundred shots
Uh, so either kill me pull the plug nigga
Cause I'm that nigga, the real nigga, sittin behind that trigger
Cause TRU be them TRU playaz
So Big Ed puts it down and keeps dumpin on them playa haters

Chorus x2
