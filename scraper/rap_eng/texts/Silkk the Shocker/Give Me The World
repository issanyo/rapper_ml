[Intro]
Yo, Godfather I come today to ask you a favor
Young Silkk, I've always liked you, today before we make you a made nigga, just tell me a little more about yourself

[Verse 1]
My life started fucked up, got me lost in the game
They told me I never was gonna amount to nothing so started slanging some cane
You could love or hate it, nigga wanna see Silkk incarcerated
They complicated, contemplated, that's why I can't be faded
I hate it, they sucked up, they mad, that I made it
Young Silkk, overrated, keep my dope, overweighted
Check out my Mercedes, respect, with a nigga like I smash
Hand on four five surrounded by killers and soldiers and bulletproof glass
Mob representin', linger, solider's kiss
My pinky finger, my balls, camouflaged by this rap singin'
Drug dealin' made me famous, so I'ma keep on doin' it
Got used to it, the whole world united for me

[Chorus]
Give me the world
I want everything from dollars to cream
Give me the world
Large amounts of money, the American dream
Give me the world
High class pussy and expensive cars
Give me the world
Finer foods and cuban cigars
Give me the world
Money and power, it's my only plan
Give me the world
I won't rest, 'til the world's in my hand

[Verse 2]
Lo ciento mucho
Fuck that! You came short on my dope
Cut off one of your fingers, send it in the mail
You'll have my money by twelve, send the other four
The game designed by me, so I can't lose
I make if they don't give me what I want
I make them an offer they can't refuse
I pay dues, gave a small time for Lent
I stay in dirt like grass, you'll never find my fucking fingerprints
Don't lie snitches in this game, niggas see men's shoes
Loyalty is everything, can't break the rules
See me kinda man lost a ki of some cane
But I can't cry over spilled milk, had to charge it to the game
Invested large in Vegas, I roll with top notch
Man look, driving jet planes, sittin' on yachts
All I wanna do is represent (represent), should I say
All I wanna get (do) is presidents

[Chorus]
Give me the world
I want everything from dollars to cream
Give me the world
Large amounts of money, the American dream
Give me the world
High class pussy and expensive cars
Give me the world
Finer foods and Cuban cigars
Give me the world
Money and power, it's my only plan
Give me the world
I won't rest, 'til the world's in my hand
Give me the world
Money and power, it's my only plan
Give me the world
I won't rest, 'til the world's in my hand
