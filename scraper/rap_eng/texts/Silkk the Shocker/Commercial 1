[Intro: Silkk the Shocker]
What's up niggas and niggas?

Tag teamin' with Spiral Records
Check out our latest shit that's comin' out, that gangsta shit

[Verse: Skull Duggery]
Spiral for life, that's my only clique
Hoodlum, that what that represent
Jive suckers, shouldn't be on my Earth anyway
That's why I put them 6 feet deep every day
Listen, do you think I play with you suckers?
Only thing I represent, brothers (What?)
Let you know one thing, [?] my gang (Gang)
And I'm straight screamin', "Where them hoodlums at?"

[Outro: Silkk the Shocker]
Huh, that's enough, nigga
I know that shit dope, dope, dope
That's called [?], nigga
It's droppin' September 24
Y'all bitches better pick it up 'cause it's gonna be the business
Y'all heard me?
No Limit and Spiral
