Alot of people don't realize
How us young black businessmen down here in No Limit doing it
But they do understand we making alot of money

[C-Murder]
I got it made plus I get paid and paid
You wanted No Limit so I brought the brigade
I'm true to the game so I'm draped in tats
The most valuable player because of my stats
All the Platinum sales because I'm so gifted
Ya I used to slang I even shop lifted
When I went to jail and went upstate
I beat a charge cause my paper was straight
I wanted a truck so I bought me a Nav
An I wanted some pussy so I paid for the ass
I got it made so they call me a made nigga
If rap was dope I guess I'd be a drug dealer
I got the feds all over my dealy
You infiltrate my click, really
Mothafuckers must like to see theyselves get played
Cause TRU niggas gettin' paid

[Chorus x6]

We trying to get paid

[Silkk The Shocker]
Now I came thru the door, I said it before
Last year I'm worth a little something, this year I'm worth more
I gots to get paid, I gots to have it made
Nigga street smarts, my game stay sharp just like a blade
See I'm a be worth something an see if I don't get killed
I'm trying to be the first nigga out the projects worth more than a mil
I smash something think about the future so I stash something
Don't think the money will change me I'm still down to click-click and blast something
See I gots to get cash but I guess it be in time
Now see you gotta get yours I gotta get mine
And when I get something for niggas its the most popular kind
And when I buy something that's for me nigga its top of the line
Now nigga on the real I gots to fulfill my own dreams
Fuck going to the game and trying to own my own team
Nigga believe I scheme shit to dream shit the paper
Chasin' tryin' to make mils on the real so stop hating

[Chorus x8]
