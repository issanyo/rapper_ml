[Verse: Silkk & Girl]
Look, you ain't gotta say too much
From the look in your eyes, I can tell you wanna (Shh)
And you ain't gotta run no game, I heard it before
And it's all the same, uh-huh
Well you ain't gotta say too much
From the look in your eyes, I can tell you wanna (Shh)
And you ain't gotta call me your boo
Just as bad as you want some, I want some too
