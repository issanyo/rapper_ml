[Silkk the Shocker]
Hoody Hoo(gun shot)

[Chorus]
Run, run, run, run, run
When you see us wit them guns niggas better fuckin' run
Run, run, run, run
I don't give a fuck where you from, when you see us, better run
Run, run, run, run
I don't give a fuck where you from, when you see us, better run
Run, run, run, run
When we come wit them guns(niggas better fuckin' run)

I tell a nigga once mane, fuck tryna tell a nigga twice
I tell a nigga once, he miss it tha first time
That mean I didn't tell a nigga right
Fuck tellin' a nigga polite, tell nigga nice
An tell niggas I'mma thug
How I sold drugs, still a killa
I wish my breath would kill a nigga wit slugs
All yall niggas around, I'm gonna ask 'em all
Niggas been hype, but that's tha liquor talkin', I'mma relax 'em dawg
Relax there fawl
Ten is what I'm gonna count
You ain't wit these niggas you better bounce like a basketball
Dirty South, where niggas talk sideways dawg
Where niggas close streets & chalk sidewalks off
No evidence, niggas use revolvers dawg
Empty, squeeze, aim til' there ain't no problems at all
Shit niggas still livin', got tha same problem wit dawg
Wacth out, watch out he still breathin' watch out( three gun shots)
Problem solved
Ghetto ass nigga tote choppers & shit
Ghetto slang, fuck tryna sound all proper & shit
Now picture me sayin' up tha cash, I'll put a lug in yo ass
Put tha money in tha duffle bag
I don't wanna be greedy, I just want enough ta last
Shit yall really lucky we sell records, cause yall be ass up
Picture Me, P, C, all my niggas masked up
Tellin' yall to run

[Chorus]

(Ut oh)
When they see us got 'em like faint in tha club
Pourin' champagne on 'em look & they thinkin' it's blood
I meet a thug & they shouldn't even much bein' this close
I got 'em shook up like ooh like they seen a ghost
Now see if I ain't had, in tha middle of tha where I would be
But they scared of me but look they gotta right, they should be
I might fuck wit some dawg but I don't fuck wit many
I got some hard news but I gotta find a way to break it to 'em gently
If they ain't got no flow & ain't got no dough
Try somethin' new cause me if I ain't got no mo'
I'm a hustla, hope everythang I do bubble
Hope my album go triple or atleast double
If not, somebody in trouble
You better wacth what you sayin & tha way you sayin' words
Yeah I got money & all dawg, but look I'd rather spend yerns
You this No limit shit dawg, we bounded by blood
One scream Hoody Hoo & we surroundin' tha club
You better

Chorus(2X)
