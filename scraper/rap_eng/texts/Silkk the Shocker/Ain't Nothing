Chorus: [Mo B. Dick]
New Orleans hoes, Baton Rouge hoes
Hoes, hoes, ain't nothin but hoes
Oakland hoes, Frisco hoes
Hoes, hoes, ain't nothin but hoes
Chi-Town hoes, Mississippi hoes
Hoes, hoes, ain't nothin but hoes
Carolina hoes, Tennessee hoes
Hoes, hoes, ain't nothin but hoes

[Silkk the Shocker]
Another day, another show
Another state, another hoe
My fault, my homie, your girlfriend is walking
Man, uh, she should of been at stage up at my show
Man, yo' girl's a hoe, man
You need to get with the program
On a slow jam I be like knockin boots
But, um, raise up the skirt an I be kockin who?
Maybe it's your girlfriend, I can't really tell they all look the same
It be hoes comin in different, shapes, an sizes, what's her name?
I don't know, but um, maybe it's Brenda
It could of been Rochel, my homie told me that he hit her
Now a hoe comes a dime-a-dozen
It could be yo' baby mama, or it could be yo' baby mama's cousin
But it's just like I'm tryin to stay Tru
Cuz a hoe is hoe an it might be yo' boo (True!)
Hoe, hoe, hoe, hoe, hoe, hoe, hoe, hoe

Chorus

[Silkk the Shocker]
Once a hoe, always a hoe
All of a sudden she's a virgin, hell no
Fa sho I comes to town, on Greyhound, never that
First class all the way so I'm lookin for something to tap
Yo' girl friend is the closest I see, man it ain't coincidence
But um, I gots to like represent, put it down for my dead presidents
I be a hustler for life, I got yo' baby mama at the crib
I don't know wassup but I gots to give
What she wants she wants it from the back
She gon' hollar my name, not yo' name (Oh Silkk!)
It's all the same as yo' game
I plays her for whatever though (What about my ride?)
Never though (Please?), never hoe
See the relationships I'm in I only deal wit like one
I likes to fucks an get up an plus they mad keep it much tighter
I mess their hair up, he gets they hair fixed
I drive the wheels, he pays the bills
Cuz all hoes suck dick (You ain't talkin to me), yeah
I'm talkin to you, bitch
Cuz all girls ain't bitches but all bitches is hoes grown
I don't know you cuz you got cha clothes on

Chorus

[Silkk--Talking]
West Side hoes, East Side hoes
All them hoes ain't nothin but hoes
I mean South Side hoes, North Side hoes
All them hoes ain't  nothin but hoes
I mean them droopy ass hoes, them broke ass hoes
All them hoes ain't nothin but hoes
I mean, I mean
I mean all them hoes ain't nothin but hoes
I mean
Wassup, dawg
This ya boy Silkk, knaw'm sayin
Now look, peep this song out
I ain't sayin all girls are hoes but um, Ms. Tucker
Or should I say Ms. Lawrence Tucker, check this out
They say hoes don't exist
You ain't been in my neighborhood
But um, all the real girls know, check this out
If they ain't hoes they gon' laugh at this song
An if you  ain't laughin that's tellin you one thang
You a hoe, an if this song offends you, then what's that sayin?
You's a hoe, so, check ya self
