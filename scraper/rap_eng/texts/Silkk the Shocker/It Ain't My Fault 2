[Craig B]
What's really happenin?
This shit again for the 99
Silkk The Shocker, Mystikal, and Craig B
It still ain't my fuckin fault
Ya heard me?

Chorus
[Silkk The Shocker/(Mystikal)]
(Uh ohhhhhh!)
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
It ain't my fault
(Did I do that)
It ain't my fault
(Did I do that)
It ain't my fault
(Did I do that) x2

[Mystikal]
That's right my meat and potatoes come from my lyrical label
I throw my rhymes for No Limit like Jeff George throw for the Raiders
Don't cut the head off a hater, don't cash the check that they paid ya
Jump in a Deville or Mercedes, Lexus or Navigator
Five hundred niggas talkin bout what they goin do, how they goin ruin my day
Not none of them niggas be talkin like that when they come round my way
Hold your mouth as tight as you can, whatever you don't loosen your lip
I make your tightest hardest rapper brush his teeth with my dick
I'm strict, I'm rich, I'm young, I'm black, I'm set
I got it, I hold it, I run it, I do it to death
I'm hot, I'm dirty, I'm oiled, I'm strapped, I'm done
Don't blame it on me if the police find a pistol and blunt

Chorus x2

[Silkk The Shocker]
Ahhhhh, lemme get it started, respect that I can finish
You talk about goin to war, if you knowin you can't win
We'll make our money make cash, with no gimmicks
I ride the tank and my back reads No Limit
Mistah rowdy rowdy, write a book about it
Every rhyme, all the time you make a hook about it
Money I count it, but it ain't enough
Heard I had chicks around me, chicks I can't touch
Since I have niggas around me that ain't goin bust
If you ever see like that you know them niggas ain't with us
It ain't my fault if my name spell cash
It ain't my fault if your girl got my name tatooed on her ass
It ain't my fault if your concert can't sell out half the show
It ain't my fault if you do twice as much as me and I get half the dough
Yall saw me style, change my flow
Bad money, good money, change my dough
I can't be bought, can't be bought, I didn't do it ain't my fault
Now what

Chorus x2

[Silkk The Shocker/(Mystikal)]
Made man (that's that rapper)
Mistah! (ghetto fabulous)
(Hangin out the door boy) 504 boy
(I bet I got cash) you got to get more boy
(Hit em up, hit the floor boy) Gotta go boy
(I don't die no ho boy)
That's Nino Brown (G Money) and I'm Vito...boy

Chorus x4

[Silkk The Shocker]
Yeah
From the east coast
To the west coast
North, midwest, southside
All my dawgs
It ain't chall fault, It ain't my fault
Don't be mad at me
I'm makin it happen ya heard me?
Mystikal, Silkk The Shocker
