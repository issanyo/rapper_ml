You fell into my trap why don't you go ahead and destroy yourselves
You fucking little monkeys

This Ghetto Got me trapped (Ughhhh)
But I ain't ready yet

[Chorus: Sons of Funk and Master P]
Lord won't you wash away my pain (this ghetto's got me trapped)
Some say life is a crazy game (but I ain't ready yet)
Lord won't you wash away my pain (this ghetto's got me trapped)
Some say life is a crazy game (but I ain't ready yet)

[Master P]
Found me on the street corner hangin' with the big niggas
Playin' football in the ghetto we call it flea flicker
And ain't no rules 'cause niggas get shot
And every fuckin' day niggas runnin' from the cops
Nigga won't change mama 'til you bury me
But make sure six TRU niggas carry me
But if they miss know (nigga) you a goner
'Cause there ain't gone be no family members to mourn ya

I wasted sperm, for the ovaries
Drug dealin', to penetentaries (Ughhh)

[Chorus: Sons of Funk and Master P]
Lord won't you wash away my pain (this ghetto's got me trapped)
Some say life is a crazy game (but I ain't ready yet)
Lord won't you wash away my pain (this ghetto's got me trapped)
Some say life is a crazy game (but I ain't ready yet)

[Silkk the Shocker]
Its a cold and cruel world sometimes it gets shady
I ain't been the same since my auntie gave birth to a crack baby
Wanna know why I'm rowdy I be clutchin' my Glock
'Cause if I have P and C come over and tell mama young Silkk just got shot
I couldn't even close my eyes and not feel the pain
I could re-open my eyes and realize
All the niggas that lost their lives in this game
I lost a lot tryin' learn the facts of life fuck color nigga we all struggle
With this black or white to all my niggas in penitentiaries
I received ya'll letters
And I swear to hang in there if things don't get better
Now picture this I got Auntie dyin' of overdose uncle dyin' of aids
Realize that I got a little money but there's somethings money can't save
Is there a heaven for gangstas is there a heaven period
And based on the fact that things did wrong probably 'cause I hang with
Too many killers and niggas dyin' over wars shits hard where I'm from
That's why I spit it how I live it and I get it how it come
On top of that I had a fucked up day
To god look couldn't find the words to explain so I'll tell you
Tonight when I pray feel my pain

[Chorus: Sons of Funk and Master P]
Lord won't you wash away my pain (this ghetto's got me trapped)
Some say life is a crazy game (but I ain't ready yet)
Lord won't you wash away my pain (this ghetto's got me trapped)
Some say life is a crazy game (but I ain't ready yet)

Lord won't you wash away my pain (this ghetto's got me trapped)
Some say life is a crazy game (but I ain't ready yet)
