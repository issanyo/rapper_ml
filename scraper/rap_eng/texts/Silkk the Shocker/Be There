Sup Ma, I-I know I ain't really been there for you and shit like I was supposed to be, but, I'm ready to make that change, you know I was like runnin' tha streets for my niggas and shit not makin' no time for you, you the only one who really had a nigga back, but, uh-huh, (I always, I love you), yeah, I know you do...

I know you care for me, I know you really do care for me
'Cuz through thick and thin, you always was there for me
I know you care for me, I know you care for me
Through thick and thin, you always was there for me
(Baby, I can't wait to spend my life with you)
I know sometimes you get sick of me sayin' "sorry"
But this time I really mean it, maybe I took it too far
I know, some things I did was cold
When you called, my boys called, I just put you on hold
And my fault, I thought I'd just tell you that
I know I'm wrong, I've put you through Hell and back
But look, I'm back from Hell tryin' to take you to Heaven
I know I fucked up in tha past, I'm tryin' to make shit better
And, you never stressed when I went out
You just stood through the hard times and just blessed me when I went out
You leavin' me, wasn't part of my plan
I don't want you leavin', but if you decided to, I'd understand
'Cuz you was there through tha rain and tha sunny days
Stood by me when most chicks would run away
That's why you get respect when you're around my crew
One day I'ma change, I just hope that you're around when I do (yes)

(Chorus)
Baby, I love you, baby, I want you, baby, I need you
To be there for me
Baby, I love you, baby, I want you
Baby, I can't wait to spend my life with you

I need a chick if I get locked up, she'd come visit
If I ain't got a ride, then she'd come get me
I need a chick who'd hold me down if I gotta do a year flat
Her girls tell her "move on" but she ain't tryin' to hear that
She with me just for me
Not that I could have her seein' jewels like she worked at Tiffany's
Not that I could get her everything she wish she had
Spend nights on tha yacht, spend days on Fifth Ave
Or that I could turn her Winter's into Summer
Show her accounts that look like telephone numbers
'Cuz, if you tha one, they gon' know you tha one
It's really nothing we ain't gonna be able to do for fun
Beverly Hillbillies, country like tha Clampett's
Put you in a neighborhood, tha south version of tha Hampton's
Um, some are about this, no doubt it's strange
And what's your last name, it's not mine, that's why we change it, I got you

Baby, I love you, baby, I want you, baby, I need you
To be there for me
Baby, I love you, baby, I want you, baby, I need you
To be there for me

Sometimes she like to fight and she likes to fuss
'Cuz she likes what happens after we make up
Shit, she wake up to a kiss
And if I get her real mad, she wake up to a gift
And, she don't do much, sometimes she might pout
At tha most she'll slam a couple of doors in tha house
But then it's back to whatever
That's tha way to get attention, not to mention make tha love much better
And, she's secure so when I look
And tha only time we go out to eat is after I cook
'Cuz sometimes she be buggin'
Hard for her to trust me, cuz she heard about all tha days I was thuggin'
But now she know that it ain't nothin' but gossip
You know they jealous, you could tell how they watch us
And ma, all they tryin' to do is stop us
But you ain't gotta trip no more, if you need me, I got ya

Baby, I love you, baby, I want you, baby, I need you
To be there for me
Baby, I love you, baby, I want you
Baby, I can't wait to spend my life with you

Baby, I can't wait to spend my life with you
