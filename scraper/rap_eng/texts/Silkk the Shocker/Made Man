Last Year I was the help, This year I'm the boss
You don't like it? Fuck ya'll, they'll find ya'll niggas lost
Fuck with real niggas, mob figures, not tru niggas that's soft
I talking about visiting some of you niggas, some of you niggas is talk
I always been a made man starting I was a teen
Through the streets where I knew how to hustle
So the Don put me down on his team
Told me ya down to take a chance
Ya gotta be down to dirty dance
If so the world can be yours, so I put my life in his hands
I know I'm up in the game but I learned quickly
Told me to live good but wouldn't give it up when they come to get you
Told me never make moves with your heart
Never snitch if you get caught
Never trust nobody a 100 percent realize anybody can be bought
Everybody got a price
Money's nothing without power, respect, loyalty it's a way of life
You've been chosen to be the Made Man everybody gotta turn
But it's rules to this shit that everybody gotta learn
So go from poverty to riches
Before I rule, choose my girl
Today it's the streets, tomorrow I rule the world

[Chorus]

I want the world the and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Power, loyalty, respect, from the cradle to the grave
I wanted to rule and I did, the day I was made, I'm a Made Man

I want the world the and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Born leader, cradle to the grave
I wanted to rule and I got my chance the day I was made, I'm a Made Man


[Silkk]
I want the finer things, the cars, house, and diamond rings
Wait patiently cause I know that time will bring it
I'm a Made Man touch it no mo, I don't touch no coke
I'm a made man, fuck it, I don't even show up for court
Judge tried to give me ten
Pointed the middle finger cause I thought he was trippin
I can tell him why every nigga I had beef with, them niggas wind up missing
Used to be broke but now it's nothing but dollar signs
Used to be convicted felonies
But now if I get convicted it's white collar crimes
Shit never been nervous, if I was never let it show
Cause of my baby face I did a lot of crime but they let me go
Usually females come to get me
Never ever leave no witnesses
If i gotta do it, it gotta get done, nothing personal just business
A Made Man with a vision, learned to master the system
My family never seen me, I just send them presents on Christmas
I want the world, take trips to Reno stop in the Casino
Make a lot of loot, have suits designed by Valentino
I want the world and everything up in it, when I said it I meant it
Time to ride high but this time the sky's the limit
Some it feels like my last line, my last rhyme
Gave the world to little brother never been nothing but the last Don
I want the world

[Chorus]
