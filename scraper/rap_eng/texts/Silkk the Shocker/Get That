Yo and this is No Limit records
I am Snoop D O motherfuckin' double G
Partyin' with my [unverified] Silkk The Shocker
You a made man now nigga, yeah

Year round party
Y'all get 'em up, get it up
What up Snoop?

Wake up, jump out of bed and get dressed
My life is a mess, nah better yet it's a test
I snatched the chopper from the coppers then put on my vest
Life's a baseball game out west
Oh yes, you rockin' with the best

The S N double O P, your grandmama know me
So for all my homegirls and all my homies
Ain't no limit picnic and it's on me
Our world is G, so roll with me

And Silkk The Shocker and grab some gin for this vodka
Got summertime rockin' for your jeeps and trucks
Big June Bug in the house, what up?
Got a jar full of dope and a box of blunts
Hoes in the house, if you see 'em turn 'em out
Bitches walkin' by sayin' 'hi' to me
And niggas givin' dat 'cause they ride with me

We goin' throw a party so my homies come and chill
(Give it up, get it up)
All the hoes invited so you know we goin' get ill
(Give it up, get it up)
We goin' throw a party so ladies come and chill
(Give it up, get it up)
All my dogs invited so we gotta keep it real

Yo, yo, yo it ain't nothin' but a N O L I M I to the T
Party, so all my dogs could ride with me
Hopped out the drop, the drivers side of course
You seen me somewhere before, you did
Probably was in the Vibe or the Source
You know what I do when it's time to floss

I'm a do it, you know I ain't got time to talk
But I see somethin' in the corner and she lookin' kinda fly
I tell my dog Snoop
(Psst psst)
Man you might as well go ahead and stop me
(Lemme holla at you dog)

She done met up with a star, eye contact
I nodded, she nodded back, then we met up at the bar
I told her I keep ice on my wrist, tight keep ice on my chin
And I'll still respect you tomorrow and tonight I hit it
But you only got a couple minutes to choose

And my time is like dollars so I only got a couple minutes to lose
In a minute I'm a hop in my ride, if you in this cool
If not ya gotta make a decision by the time I finish my food
Now what?

We goin' throw a barbecue so niggas light the grill
(Give it up, get it up)
All my dogs invited so you know we goin' get ill
(Give it up, get it up)
We goin' throw a barbecue so ladies light the grill
(Give it up, get it up)
All my dogs invited so you got to keep it real

Now I used to be on the block
Now I'm in the drop chillin' with Snoop
But I walk through the door I feel animosity
(Oh, you feelin' it too)
Probably 'cause we say our name we could be stealin' they booth
Probably 'cause I'm platinum, we dark, could be chillin' at two
(The South West connect, big chains on our neck
Boy give us respect, y'all shit on deck)

Aight Snoop, you got the weed
(Yeah)
And I got the liquor
(fa sho)
Meach got the food but who got the strippers
(I don't know)

'Cause ain't no party like the ones we drove
(Whassup)
And um, ain't no cars like the ones we drove
And um, ain't no dollars like the ones we fold
When we give somethin', call us, it's outta control

So whether it's summertime, winter, spring or fall
(Look for somethin' big from Silkk and Top Dogg
We party with nothin' but bud, nothin' but thugs)
East to West, peep the best, keep it stress, nothin' but love
(Yeah)
Fuck

We goin' throw a barbecue so niggas light the grill
(Give it up, get it up)
All my dogs invited so you know we goin' get ill
(Give it up, get it up)
We goin' throw a barbecue so ladies light the grill
(Give it up, get it up)
All my dogs invited so you got to keep it real
(Give it up, get it up)

Ain't nothin' but a party, baby
G'z out here goin' crazy
How the world goin' even fade us
Either love or hate us
Ain't nothin' but a party, baby
Two low down G'z goin' crazy

Yeah, ain't nothin' but a, huh
And my cell phone goin' off in this bitch, what
Yeah, ha, we ain't even trippin' dog
Shout out to the whole world
What this the end
Till next time, I'm out
