Verse 1
[Big Ed]
Had my back ever since I was pulling 211's
The rich dude, I was on my knees trying to shoot a seven
Even when there's no food in the fridge, you say you're lucky to have me
Never tripped on the life I live
You had my kid, you held my strap to prove it's for life
You got Lady Assassin tatted on your back, sometimes I don't act like I should
You still understand what I'm going through, the pressures from the hood
I'm trying to make it all good forever
I can't see living life without me and you together
I know I'm gone a lot trying to make it, but just have patience
It's all for you, my soul I'll stake it

[Chorus]

Verse 2
[Silkk tbe Shocker]
See you're a star, met you at the bar, seen you through the Cartier frames
Excuse me miss, I'm Silkk the Shocker, TRU is the clique that I claim
Money and wealth, good times and bad times, that just comes with the game
Don't trip on the females and shit, miss, look, that just, like
Comes with the name
I need a down girl that's down to ride
See that girl, look, 3-5-5 Ferrari parked up on the outside
I live the life of a thug, that's why I'm never smiling
Got out the projects with my thugs, I'm probably on some like island
See, I'm a soldier and I need a soldierette like you
Hot tubs, backrubs, celebrating over dinner for two
Said you wanna go to war, let's see if you can last for the 2nd round
And I don't know, there's something about ya, makes Silkk the Shocker
Wanna settle down
Now what, I told ya

[Chorus]

Verse 3
[Master P]
I hang with killas and gees to get my cash on
I need a thug girl at night to get my smash on
Lingerie with the camoflague (camoflague)
Hennessey with the weed, baby girl I'm at the front line
And we can do it til we weak (til we weak)
A little Isley brothers, me and you, between the sheets
In the game getting rowdy (Ungh!)
But don't trip, `cause tonight me and you gonna get bout it bout it
Huh bruh?
