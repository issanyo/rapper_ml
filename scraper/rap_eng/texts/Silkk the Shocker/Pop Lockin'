[Intro: Silkk the Shocker + (Snoop Dogg)]
Hey yo Snoop
Tell Xzibit and Dre to be havin' that thing bumpin' when I come out there

(That's funky Soopafly..
Big Snoop Dogg  {Snoop Dogg!}
Silkk the Shocker
Ain't No Limit to this
2000
Gangsta shit
West West ya'll)

It's my second home...
Snoop tell 'em what's up

[Snoop Dogg]
The gangstas bang, do that damn thang
Me and my nephew, Dogghouse keep it true
Roll that weed - pass that drank
Holla at your nigga, baby bring your thang
You could shake what you got, get your pussy real hot
Jump in the 'gator we could slide to my speezot
Just keep it on leezy, I know it ain't easy
You bucket mouth breezy
Silkk this bitch cute, thick and all that (damn)
"Why must I, chase the cat"
If you was me (me), and I was you (you)
You'd probably floss on a nigga
Burnin' rubber in a 52
Most bitches do, and most niggas do too
In the land where it's all about the red and blue
But me - I'd rather get the greenery
And smoke out the whole motherfuckin' scenary

[Chorus]
Pop lockin' in my Rolls Royce, Cadillac
Lincoln and Mercedes Benz
Pop lockin' at the Howard Johnson, the Sheraton
Pop lockin' at the Holiday Inn
Pop lockin' in my Rolls Royce, Cadillac
Lincoln and Mercedes Benz
Pop lockin' at the Howard Johnson, the Sheraton
Pop lockin' with all my friends

It's that West Coast way we're livin'
(Money, cars, weed, bitches)
It's that West Coast way we're livin'
(From the South to the West)
It's that West Coast way we're livin'
(Money, cars, weed, bitches)
It's that West Coast way we're livin'

[Goldie Loc]
Why must I, be like that
With them ???? tux, draped in all black
Takin' back like the pop lockin' ???? gold suits
Bangin' back in the day just to get a lil' jucie
Fuck the trus'
Cause we can get Cripped out crazy
Blast on all you suckas, went to throw away 380
Fuck around get found up in a dumpster somewhere
Cause them Southside-Eastside gangstaz don't care
Nigga I won't, fool you don't (know you don't)
He fuckin' with no niggas more gangsta than me
Tell him the truth loc
120 proof outs the sun roof
Throwin' up the motherfuckin' ????
Tru Tank Doggs fuckin' with Bigg Snoop Dogg
Soopafly to keep them high so they could come out there draws
What you player hatin' perpitrator niggas make me mad
So I'm mad off you suckas and my pants never sag

[Chorus]

[Silkk the Shocker]
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party, you know who we bring
No Limit and Dogghouse, ain't nothin' but a G thang
You know, we think to win
Y'all think money's soft, nah y'all better think again
Cause if ain't about money, then why would I bother?
If she ain't keepin' it real, then why would I holla?
Til' she come swim by the crib with the house, come with the lake
Eat as much as you want to as long as you know what come with the plate
On my lap a fo' five, in the trunk - keep a K
In the deck P, Snoop, Biggie, Pac, fool just keep up Dre
And the heat I got on me, always gotta ride with it
I don't spend money, fool I spend money cause I can - die with it
Project nigga, huh, get my work on
Host MTV with a Eastsidaz shirt on
Ghetto like that, you know how we live
On the East it's 6 feet, on the West it's 3 wheels

[Chorus]


[Outro: Silkk the Shocker]
Soopafly, No Limit
My nigga Xzibit, Bad Azz, Eastsidaz Gang
Doggy's Angels, Dogg Pound, and Damian Young
Cube, Westside, my nigga Marv, what up Eminem?

(Silkk the Shocker baby, and Bigg Snoop Dogg
Bow-wow!
It's another one of those - Dogghouse, No Limit, Soopafly
Somethin' for your ear
