[Silkk & Master P talking]
Yo, P was happening dog
Ah man, it's still a drought you know, but the game then change these
Youngstas than made it bad, you know we all about our paper but some of
These fools just make and fake murder
They want it the easy way

Chorus:(2x)
See I don't want to be here
If I don't gotta
My weed habit, is so close to snorting powder
Got a few bitches, but it's all about a dollar
And they don't holla, unless you moving narcota

[Silkk the Shocker]
I'm just sitting in my Cadillac
Riding on some triple gold
Smoking octamos,nigga
Shining up my vogues
Thanking this ho called me
And she was tripping out
Say I had a baby by her
Figuring I was her only ticket out
I'm just trying stack a meal,no what I'm saying
That shit real, trying to hide and dodge
But I can't seem to hid my fucking bill
On how to cook dope, and chop a key
My brother showed me that
I only live once,guess what
A dope fiend told me that
These hoes be trying to holla
It seems that I got riches
When I got money, I got bitches
I got friends that want to get it
Can he hit it, then quit it
To try to survive and stay alive
It's a everyday struggle,every day hustle
You can see it in my eye, but I don't want to die
I don't want to be here
If I don't gotta
I got friends and bitches, but they don't holla
If I don't got narcotics or dollars, I

[Master P talking]
Damn, check this out Elror
It's real out here, you heard me, huh bro

Chorus:(2x)

[Fiend]
Man I might have a daughter
No money, no life
Check it shocker, just bills, hanging wit Cuz
Not giving, a fuck, and I'm telling you what's real
You want to know what kill
Most of these niggas on these streets, is jive
I don't know why, these young cats out here
Think they got nine lives
I got some evil pride
And I then lost the closest thing to me
Pretty fucked up trade
Or i got some killas that want to do me
Them girls trying to glue me
What all I trying do, is what I love
Let my people know I feel them,and now and then then go smoke some bud
I got a habit with drugs
Which I ain't suggesting for beginners
In my hood, ain't no winners
Just some thugging ass sinners
Presenta, my life, my life, and take a good view
My bad days, i wouldn't dare
Wanna wish them upon you

Chorus:(2x)

[Silkk the Shocker]
Now see I didn't ask to come here
I guess a twisted faith of luck
15 minutes of unprotected sex
In a heat of moment, came a quick ass nut
Now if I wouldn't been born
I wouldn't grew, I wouldn't knew
Never had to go through, half the tangs a nigga went through
I'm in the projects hearing gunshots
Right before I close my eyes
All I heard was one shot
And they only sent one cop when he died
I got some questions
That I couldn't really understand for awhile
They say rain brang pain
But what brang smiles
And see I guess I was to caught up in those fake niggas
And bitches to know
I guess I was blinded by the fast money
And switches on the 64
They gotta, gotta be a better way out
Then hell or jail
I know I'm wrong for selling dope to my family
Just to get mail
Some get high off of sess
To relieve their stress
But no matter, how much success
You can't cheat death
Where yal at

[Master P talking]
Heard that, can't get no realler than this
I don't want to be here if I don't have to

Chorus:(2x)
