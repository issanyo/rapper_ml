[Master P]
I did time in tha jail but never rat to tha feds
I know homies locked down for life, never boast or brag
Missy said "I got Glock boy," I drive a drop boy
An I'm a soulja, I ain't no hot boy(ya heard me)
Now if ya ain't got it, go get it, see my click keeps it real
We started in tha projects but we own houses on tha hill
I don't own no plane, nigga no chopper but I ride first class
I got a couple of super models wit my name on they ass(ha ha)
It ain't my fault that we back on top
But back yo bitch ass up from my convertable drop
They call me tha ghetto Bill Gates cause I started from tha streets
Diesel laced tha beat, I'm out that C-P-3
An yall know how we roll ya heard me(ya heard me, ha ha, hoody)

[Chorus: Silkk & (Erica Foxx)]
It's about to go down (down, down)
Party at tha spot, it's about to go down(down, down)
Everybody gets in, it's about to go down(down, down)
Drinks on me, it's about to go down(down, down)
More bitches than niggas, it's about to go down(down, down)
Ain't nodody trippin', it's about to go down(down, down)
We all got money, it's about to go down(down, down)
An if we ain't got it, it's about to go down(down, down)
V-I-P nigga, it's about to go down(down, down)
Everybody flossin', it's about to go down(down, down)
Everybody shinin', it's about to go down(down, down)
Everybody real, how yall likin' me now

[Silkk]
You know me & this No Limit shit, always represent
Pull up in tha six hummer like tha muthafuckin' president
Love to see my name in begets
Whisper to shorty(tryna do somethin') all you gotta do is say yes
An I'm gonna probaly take you out to tha crib
In other words take you out where I live
Show you around like you ain't never seen befo'
I usually(uh un) don't be seen wit hoes
Only top notch chicks that's out to represent me
Ain't shy, quick to undress up in tha bentley
Look shorty that's my yacht, that's my spot, that's my drop
You guessed it, yes I'm up on top
Not tryin' to stop, tryna make a couple million
An see if me & you can make a couple children
I through wit it, I'm through frontin'
You know what I'm about, tryna see if you tryna do somethin'
What

[Chorus: Silkk & (Erica Foxx)]

Party at tha spot, it's about to go down(down, down)
Everybody gets in, it's about to go down(down, down)
Drinks on me, it's about to go down(down, go down, go down)
