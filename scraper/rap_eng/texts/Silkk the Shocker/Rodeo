Put your right arm up, dip, and buck your hips(come on, bump your hips)
(Come on, buck your hips)
(Do it till your saddles right)
Put your right arm up, dip, and buck your hips
Put your left arm up, dip, and buck your hips(come on)
Saddle me up, come and ride this buckin bronco
Work it out baby, video for the peep show
Dosy doe at the Alamo
Twist your hips like a tornado, explode like a volcano
Bounce up and down like a po-go
Your love it got me fiennin like a nympho, hit ya with the gusto
Erotic trust as we undergo orgasmic eruptions
Baskin in the after glow
I slam my boy like big 5 and domino
Screamin my name like old ladies screamin bingo!
I got ya shakin excess, climactic combos
She's tryin to be quit bittin the pillows
It seems it get wetter the farther in I go
You want me to go deeper?  Cause baby I go plenty mo
You can pull my slot all night like a casino
So you can ride me baby, fast or slow

CHORUS:(x4)
Ride like a buckin bronco(ride it, ride it, come on come on)
(Do you like that)
In the rodeo, a rodeo (ride it ride it, come on come on)
(Tell me do you like that)
Ride like a buckin bronco(ride it, ride it, come on come on)
(I know you like that)
In the rodeo, a rodeo (ride it ride it, come on come on)
(Tell me do you like that)

Silkk:
Come on,come on, come on, come on
Grab the lasso, and let me rope them hips
Look I love them tryin take all of it, bittin your lip
Walked in dimonds shine look true that there
Everybody talkin bout look, who that there
Can't let a good thing pass me
Come on boo an get sassy
(Boy you nasty)
I know
Forget about your man, see if you can take this
I don't hate unless it be fake, time to bust, get rape an switch(switch)
Flex the Lex, now I'm like sex in the Benz
Sex unstoppable is it possible to have sex and be friends
So come and ride this bronco, buck and dip
Can you picture this skinny cowboy, between them hips
No limit soldier, so come and ride me baby
Hard to stop when I'm inside ya baby
Now it's the new sheriff in town, down and dirty
Tryin to get this chick to serve me, ya heard me?
Ride it

CHORUS:(X4)

Mia X:
Got your saddle on, now baby I'm a getty up
First I rock steady get it wetter then I buck
Having you screamin my name, (Mama Mia) sugar walls top rankin
Keep a nigga peelin off the frequency be bankin, ah
Let her take a spankin when I ride it back, was fake you out
Playa roll when you ain't shit like an actor
Mac the, wieldest niggas mama tie em down
Silkk scarfs, hand cuffs, ghetto rodeo style now
I can ride for miles, so daddy can you keep up
Gaurenteed to knock that ass out like you been beat up
Heat up, hotter than July, cause big girls don't cry
We take it all stride out, slides up and down
Bounces all around, works it twerks it
Buy Miss Pussy crown, I wears it
I swears it's gonna (for real) be a cold day in hell no doubt
To ever say you want me out at the rodeo(uunhh)

CHORUS:(x4)
