(Silkk the Shocker)
Ya boy Shocker in the building
Heads Remain Anonymous
He Ain't Gotta Be Obvious
Ladies, if y'all thirsty, drinks on me
And you fake ballers, you know what to do
(Master P In Background)
Girls, We Like Dem Girls
We Gotta Have Them Girls
We Like Dem Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls

(Master P) + (Silkk the Shocker)
And y'all haters
Be gone, want, want want
Be gone, want, want want
Be gone, want, want want, Be Gone
You get money, (then take it to the floor)
You got game, (then take it to the floor)
You ain't scared, (then take it to the floor)O
You came to party, (then take it to the floor)

(Silkk the Shocker)
Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank god
I Don't Know but last night seemed kinda odd
The spot was hot, the place was packed
They had fat asses wall to wall and back to back
Imagine that, it was a hell of a scene
Either that or it was a hell of a dream, ya heard me
They had a few ballers but not that many
Alot of model-type chicks but not that skinny
I mean one in particular caught my eye
I mean she gave me a look when I walked by
Like "Yeah, we about to have some fun here"
Her mouth ain't move but her body sayin come here
Want want want so I passed the key
And got a hotel suite like Cassidy
And Kel, So I yell let's blaze the party
And something started up and it sounded like Atari

(Chorus: Master P)
Girls, We Like Dem Girls
We Gotta Have Them Girls
We Like Dem Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls
Girls, We Like Dem Girls
We Gotta Have Them Girls
We Like Dem Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls

(Silkk The Shocker)
My girls look, let's get it crackin'
It don't take much, let's make it happen
She thinkin' we gettin' on tha highway
I'm like mike look we still in tha driveway
And look, i can have you flossin'
In a house big enough you can get lost in
Let's spend tha weekend
Play some lil' monopoly, and some hide-and-go-seek'in
And I'm back as tha pool
So you wanna take a dip she like, " Yeah, that's cool"
See me and these thugs came to act a fool
The new no limit, we don't play by the rules
I came to party, not to clap tha game
To get tha see out of jail cause it's time to get paid
Up and down, i ain't talkin' my ways
In tha bentley gettin' my hair done, i ain't talkin' bout braids
Shorty, tell me what your name is?
Playa, tell me what your game is?
Shorty, tell me why you came here?
Playa, show me what you working with?

(Chorus: Master P)
Girls, We Like Dem Girls
We Gotta Have Them Girls
We Like Dem Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls

(Master P)
I'm country mayne, I'll punch ya brain
I'll roll with the boys that'll pluck ya mayne
You get money, you better tuck ya mayne
The haters out here, they'll cut ya mayne
Get lose with it, stay true with it
We don't want it if you let bruce bruce hit it
Get lose with it, stay true with it
We don't want it if you let bruce bruce hit it
Her neck, her back
We can fix it in my Lac
Her neck, her back
We can fix it in my Lac

(Chorus: Master P)
Girls, We Like Dem Girls
We Gotta Have Them Girls
We Like Dem Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls
Girls, We Like Dem Girls
We Gotta Have Them Girls
We Like Dem Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls

(Silkk over Chorus)
Shorty, I'ma get with you
But like Chingy, I'm only one call away
I mean I'm a baller, take that away
I'll call you heh
