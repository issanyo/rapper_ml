You ain't gotta lie to kick it
You ain't gotta lie to kick it
You ain't gotta lie to kick it to be with me
You ain't gotta lie to kick it
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, whats it gonna be, its gonna be you
Ain't gotta lie to me (2X)

Now you ain't gotta lie to me, or try to be somethin you ain't, well
Obviously, you tryin to be me, but you can't, niggas wanna be local, cuz
Some regional stars, type of nigga that got a little somethin, but guess
What nigga lease on his car, watch out for these bustas, or should I say
Fake phonies, type of nigga that buy a Timex, put a Rolex face on it, I
See niggas be talkin to me, but I can't do nothin bout what he's sayin
Type of nigga don't get a beep all day but act a fool when uhh he
Finally get page, nigga walk around stuntin, on a cellular phone, when I
Ask to use it why the battery low, cuz it's always on roam, now see
This, or should I say peep this, type of nigga that get a Benz wanna
Change the sign from a 3 to a 6, now ain't that funny, or should I say
Ain't that nothin, shit where the hummer, where the money, shit where
The 600, type of nigga that buy dope for shit, an sell it cheaper then
What he got it, wanna admit everbody in the story an everybody he be
Knowin, where the mills at, where the house on the hill at, nigga kill
That, on the real black shit where the record deal
At, shit lookin like you stole somethin, shit you owe somethin, look
Everytime I see you talkin bout Silkk let me hold somethin, see don't
Compare shit how I spit, but guess what if the shoe fit, go ahead, cuz
You ain't gotta lie to kick it. (That's real bitch)

Flaunt show, but ain't got pocket piss an no window, to throw it out, to
Talk about this one an that one, pinnochio sister let me paint a clearer
Picture, she once went around sayin she was engaged, she even had a lil
Ring, said her nigga did his thang, come to find out she traded her
Necklace an payed the difference, then gave your boy credit knowin she
Struggles tryin to get it, sports fake designer bags, brags on her
Clothin price tags, sayin she got em from her man, but bitch credit card
Scams, got a Lexus key chain, on her Cavalier car key, talkin bout she
Had a 420, bitch you tryin to be me, tellin everybody how nice her crib
Is, but every week she split out then back at her hoes house, I can't
Stand this type of bitch cussin off nothin why try, we can never kick it
Or be down but you still ain't gotta lie
