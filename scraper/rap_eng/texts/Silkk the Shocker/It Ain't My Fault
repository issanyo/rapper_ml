We can't stop now bitch
We can't stop
You can't stop us
So bitch don't try
We true soldiers and we don't die
We don't die, we don't die
We can't stop now bitch
We can't stop
You can't stop us
So bitch don't try
We true soldiers and we don't die
We don't die, we don't die

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
I'm 'bout my paper, my paper
Important people on my pager
I might not drink Alize'
But I'll smoke you under the table
Don't make me peel your potato
Don't make the devil your neighbor
I might not be nothing to you!
But I'm the shit on this label!
Five hundred words a minute make it hard to digest what I say
But five hundred #1 hits on the billboard chart gon' keep it that way
Hold on as tight as you can
Whatever you do, don't loosen your grip
Not only are they anticipating your every move
They're waiting for you to slip!!!
But like I told you before
We not gonna fall for the banana in the tailpipe
I'm not bout livin' in no six by six
Wearing no motherfuckin jail stripes
Been Bout It from the start nigga, we raw nigga
You don't wanna, go to, war nigga
We superstar niggas
You know who we are niggas
From poverty in the projects
To livin' large niggas
It take one hell of a combination, to get what we got
We soldiers on a mission, and you can't stop us!!!

[Hook: Mystikal]
We can't stop now bitch
We can't stop
You can't stop us
So bitch don't try
We true soldiers and we don't die
We don't die, we don't die
We can't stop now bitch
We can't stop
You can't stop us
So bitch don't try
We true soldiers and we don't die
We don't die, we don't die

[Verse 2: Silkk the Shocker]
Nigga wanna START SHIT
That they know they can't finish
By far niggas wanna go to war
But they know when they ain't winning
Fixin' to keep this bitch jumpin, like a muthafuckin', second line
Been Bout It, and I'll be rowdy, and you gonna know it by my, second rhyme
No Limit chain around my neck, so check, and respect the sign
Y'all wanna play, but I guarantee that you won't play, a second time
Sometime I'm in camoflauge and sometime I'm in all black
Y'all wanna go to war with us, wit you knowin' we all strapped!!!
Fuck it, pop it, don't stop it, cuz I drop, by no means, look
Beat you down like a dope fiend
Tear your ass like a pair of old jeans
Nigga what? Pistols we all got, sometimes it's all Glocks
Keep one in the chamber for danger and make sure they all cocked
Went from a, small knot to a tall knot
Nigga please, I got all the G's for breakin' these keys down to all rocks
Blow up the spot till it's all hot, surround the world together cuz y'all not
Nigga we ain't gon stop jus cuz y'all stop then it's our props
If you wanna get it started, then let's started, but let's do it right
But if you wanna get started, get started, let's do it TONIGHT!!!
Likely to get your head busted, lined in some chalk
