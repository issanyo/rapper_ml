[Crooked Eye]
Chorus
Niggas like me make the world go 'round
Beats by the pound is them niggas droppin' platnum sounds
Niggas like me roll wit extra clips
Cuz niggas like me be in some gangsta shit x2

Niggas like me quick to pop that steel
Because niggas like me, haters trying to kill
And uh, niggas like me used to slang birdies
Before niggas like me was into R-A-P
You see niggas like me ball wit nuthin but thugs

One love to the niggas dumpin shots at cops
For the crooked shit they do man it's got to stop
And they say, a nigga like me am I a menace on the streets
Cause I handle my business when we meet
