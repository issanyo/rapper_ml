[Intro: Swae Lee]
EarDrummers
I'm so far out of sight
Sounds about right
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I'm so far out of sight
Yeah that sounds about right
Sounds about right
Kill this cup, not my vibe
Wait
Be the highlight of my night
Look alive, look alive
We can start with something light
Look alive
I can get you so right
I just need an invite

[Verse 1: Slim Jxmmi]
I'm a smooth criminal
Michael Jackson moonwalkin'
Like I'm on a pill or somethin'
Five bitches 'round me, mane
It's 'bout to be a royal rumble
Hands up if you want the lumber
Hands up if your head the dumbest
Promise I'ma keep you cummin'
I get throwed out my mind
Grab a cup, catch a vibe
You look at me and you see big diamonds
I pressed the button on the coupe
The ceilin' go behind me

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I'm so far out of sight
Yeah that sounds about right
Sounds about right
Kill this cup, not my vibe
Wait
Be the highlight of my night
Look alive, look alive
We can start with something light
Look alive
I can get you so right
I just need an invite

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
You my target, no doubt
Somethin' 'bout you really stood out (poke it out!)
Come here, baby, cause you got three strikes
Come here, baby cause you got what I like
Lit from head to toe (like Bic!)
We can pour us a cointreau
Kick back, we can roll
I'ma stay rollin' indo
Shoppin' spree before breakfast
Yeah we stay in the latest
I'ma see to it, that you go crazy
Don't think I'm here to judge
I'ma rock you like a baby
Turn you out, yeah I'm that one
I'ma get you where I want you

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I'm so far out of sight
Yeah that sounds about right
Sounds about right
Kill this cup, not my vibe
Wait
Be the highlight of my night
Look alive, look alive
We can start with something light
Look alive
I can get you so right
I just need an invite
