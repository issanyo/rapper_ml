Burrr

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Bitch stop the comparisons
I'm not these other artistses
I'm Gucci Mane, La Flare
My neck on that real retarded shit
Keep a towel with me
'Cause my watch be drippin' water, bitch
And I only featured Kanye
'Cause we both some fuckin' narcissists
Narcissistic tendencies
With psychopathic pockets, bitch
My bank account is crazy, bitch
I think it needs some medicine
My straight jacket Givenchy-enchy-enchy
Can't even pronounce that shit
Designer jeans, designer drugs
Just bought me a designer bitch
Why this bitch keep hittin' my line?
She knowin' she ain't no dime and shit
Knowin' I ain't got no time to waste
Be fuckin' around with no nickel bitch
Your nigga pinchin' pennies
But I'm out here making these millions, bitch
Don't ask me who I'm votin' for
Cause I got all the presidents
My bitch walk 'round in lingerie
All day, she think she elegant
It's an elephant in the room
Guess who's the mothafuckin' elephant? (It's Gucci)
Maybach in the garage
Elevator in the residence
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Wop, yeah)

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Me and Guwop, makin' super moves
Makin' stupid cash, stack it through the roof
You don't fuck with me? The feelin' mutual
I'd feel the same if I drove that Subaru
We hit the city, the old me goin' OC
How her friend only gonna watch that, that is so weak
Seven times in a row, I could go the whole week
I could take you from the nosebleeds to the floor seats
But I need that, in the sauna, in the bathroom, at your mama's
Like a porn star, I'm a monster, you a dancer, on the camera
In the G-string, girl, I want you, at the concert, at the condo
In my bedroom, in the guestroom
In the restroom, fuck it, every room, tryna see that...

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print
