[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
The front row win this time, new Croc bag with the five
Yellow diamonds with the rainbow fire (hot)
Can't find them shoes I designed
Richard Mille, one time I gotta wind 'cause if I don't it'll die (tick)
Jean Imbert when I dine, gotcha like J.R. with the eyes
Wait, CC, hold it, excuse me, y'all could never do me
LaFerarri Coupe E, shittin' something soupy
Paparazzi, shoot me, enough to make a movie
Facts, facts, facts, never nothing loosely
So there's no assumin', I got Call of Duty, pray Wi-Fi
I could get God on the line, so, what's gettin' Karl on the line?
Oh, yeah, CC, I win, see, y'all niggas wanna be me
I'd say, "Y'all copy, un-needly" (yeah)
Wouldn't say, "You're bitin'", you're teethin' (yeah)
And anything from the archives (yeah)
It's always yes, never why (yeah)
Surf boy, 'til there's shades on my eyes (yeah)
Killed a trucker with the gold .45 (bow!)
