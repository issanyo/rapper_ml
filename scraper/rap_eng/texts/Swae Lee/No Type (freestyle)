[Intro: Swae Lee]
Yah, bad bitches is the... yah

[Hook: Swae Lee & (Bure)]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life (yessir)
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right (yessir)

[Verse 1: Bure]
Bure gon' pay the price, cuz a nigga actin' nice
Y'all niggas better watch yo self cuz right now y'all niggas skatin' on thin ice
Shutting everything down, I'm a give you just-ice
Shutting you right down, I'll put your head in a vice
Yeah
Rae Sremm, dynamic duo
Ear drummers, nobody can boo tho
King wizard that Alex Russo
Kickin' ass that Wendy Wu tho
We done got them new rooks
Lookin' through the crannies and nooks
Y'all niggas better not look
If niggas gettin' fishy then hit 'em with the hook
SHEESH!

[Hook: Swae Lee & (Bure)]
I don't got no type (yeah)
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like (Turn-up)
You ain't got no life (uh)
Cups with the ice and we do this every night (Sing it Swae Lee!)
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Verse 2: Bure]
Runnin' with the woes
Shouts out to all my foes
I'm in my beast mode
I'M 'BOUT TO EXPLODE
Y'all can take a seat
Cause I'm about to yeet
I'm a kill this beat
Gettin' the grain like wheat
Shouts out to Cullen Slaid, your hoe will get slayed
Serving you niggas like a maid
But that nigga ballin' like Dwayne Wade
Bure forever like I'm pi
Right now in the game it's do or die
Like Graduation, I'm 'bout to fly
Late Registration, I'm a 'Touch the Sky'
AHH!

[Hook: Swae Lee & (Bure)]
I don't got no type (Turn-up)
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like (yeah)
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night (Swae Lee!)
I ain't check the price (I got it)
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like (Sheesh!)
I'm just livin' life (SremmLife, haha)
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Outro]
I don't got no type, I don't got no type
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right
