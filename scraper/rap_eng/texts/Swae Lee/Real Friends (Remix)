[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
No, I think I'll stay in tonight
Skip the conversations and the "Oh, I'm fines"
No, I'm no stranger to surprise
This paper town has let me down too many times
Why do I even try? Give me a reason why
I thought that I could trust you, never mind
Why all the switching sides? Where do I draw the line?
I guess I'm too naive to read the signs

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
Wonder where they're all hidin' out (hidin' out)
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
Gotta get up out of this town

[Post-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Oh, ohhh
Ohhh, ah

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Trust slow for a reason (reason)
See through the fake pretty easy (yeah!)
Stayin' down 'till the world ends (easy)
Guilt trips on the weekend (hey)
I pack more than suits in my suitcases (yeah)
All this cash, that's friendly faces
Been movin' fast, I'm racin' (wait)
Get up, you're going places (c'mon)
Every day, tryna maintain
Same old me, ain't a damn thing change (change)
Real friends screaming, "Gang, gang, gang"

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
All they ever do is let me down (oh-no-no)
Every time I let somebody in (woah)
Then I find out what they're all about (all about, ooh)
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
Wonder where they're all hidin' out (hidin' out)
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
Gotta get up out of this town

[Post-Chorus: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]
Real friends
Oh, ohhh
Lookin' for some real friends
Real friends
Yeah!

[Bridge: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]
I just wanna talk about nothin'
With somebody that means something (conversation)
Spell the names of all our dreams and demons
For the times that I don't understand (why?)
Tell me what's the point of a moon like this
When I'm alone again (yeah yeah yeah)
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful
Where nobody knows my name?

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
And I let somebody in
But I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
All they ever do is let me down
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
Gotta get up out of this town, yeah

[Outro: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]
Spend a fortune with my real friends
Good gas, what we breathe in (oh, ohhh)
Pop corks with some real friends
Killin' the scene, yeah (ohhh, ah)
Hangin' with my real friends
That I surround myself with (ohhh, ah)
You have to have my back (ah)
Lookin' like my real friends
