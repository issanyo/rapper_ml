[Intro: Future]
You gotta have something for everybody
We call that a party pack
Got a little Xans, a little Molly, a little Lean

[Hook: Future & Swae Lee]
That's that party pack
Where that party at, yeah get that party phat
Got the Xans and the lean, that's a party pack
Do the Xans with the beans, that's a party pack
That's that party pack, hey, where that party at?
Got the Xans and the lean, that's a party pack
Got the mollies and the fiends, that's a party pack
Got the loud and some clean, that's a party pack
Where the party at, hey, where the party at?
Where the party at, hey, where the party at?

[Verse 1: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
You see a tweaker (point 'em out, point 'em out)
You see these sneakers that I'm rockin' (they ain't out, they ain't out)
I got that party pack and now she wanna bounce
The club packed, you see a hater point 'em out, point 'em out
You heard about me, word of mouth
Swae Lee got the all X, now blank out
Got the Xans and the lean, that's a party, that's a party pack
Got the mollies and the fiends, that's a party pack, that's a party pack
She a student but she always want that party pack
I don't want the whip if I can't have the roof detached
