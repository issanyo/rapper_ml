[Intro]
Uh, uh
I'm the one that won't know how it feels
How it feels

[Chorus]
I'm the one that won't know how it feels
But I think we both know how it feels
Gotta make it so hot like fire drills (ayy)
And took a ride 'cause I spent cash on them wheels

[Verse]
Go get your bag, girl, I'm not the third wheel
You're still a bad girl after all these years
Yo, didn't I give you the NyQuil?
So you're on home base and I'ma steal
I picked you up, your chest like the Man of Steel
I might just save that girl like the Man of Steel
I might just pull up on stainless steel
Don't gotta question, 'cause I know she will
Only someone involved can stay the night until (ooh)
But I think we both know how it feels (ooh, yeah)
This morning when we took shots and cheered
You just realized that you had somethin' real (ooh)
But I'm the one that don't know how to deal
I'ma a-a-always seal the deal
I'ma womp, womp, womp then seal the deal
With them diamonds that you can see from here
If they aren't A-list, just leave 'em there
'Cause you'll be hearing about us everywhere
When the squad roll up, they couldn't help but stare
Ayy, I'ma just sit that there
She got a ass, she gon' just sit it right there
I like a bad bitch when she long hair, no care
I won't ever go on no cab
I said, "You wanna take a shot?," she said, "Heck yeah"
Other niggas over there disrespect, yeah
I say, "You tryna be down?," she said, "Heck yeah"
Off the drink, baby, I'm a wreck, yeah
In the backseat, when I get the neck, yeah
Got me runnin' to you for some sex, yeah
But for one night, don't know how to feel
About a heartbreak story in Encino Hills

[Chorus]
I'm the one that won't know how it feels
But I think we both know how it feels
Gotta make it so hot like fire drills
And took a ride 'cause I spent cash on them wheels
Go get your bag, girl, I'm not the third wheel
