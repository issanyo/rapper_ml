[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
Most of them gon' talk, I know, I know
Most of them gon' fall, I know, I know
We gon' bet it all, I know-oh-oh-oh
We gon' bet it all, I know-oh

[Chorus: Khalid]
Power girl
I really wanna know your ways
I really wanna know your ways
I really wanna know your ways
I really want a power girl
You been runnin' through my section all day
You been runnin' through my mind all day
All day, all day, all day, all day, yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Khalid]
Somethin' in the way you move
Radiant beams castin' vibrant views
Pick me up when I fall down and out
Dust me off and show me all truth
Show me that I'll never fly alone
I fucked up so many times, but I still have you
Show me how you do it like that
Carryin' a brother is not easy on your back

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
I know most of them gon' talk, I know, I know
Most of them gon' fall, I know, I know
We gon' bet it all, I know-oh-oh-oh
We gon' bet it all, I know-oh

[Chorus: Khalid]
Power girl
I really wanna know your ways
I really wanna know your ways
I really wanna know your ways (wanna know, I wanna know)
I really want a power girl
You been runnin' through my section all day
You been runnin' through my mind all day
All day, all day, all day, all day, yeah, uh

[Verse 2: Swae Lee & Kendrick Lamar]
Your body and your mind is your contribution
I'm here to give your love an evolution
Power girl, power girl
If I had you, I'd travel light years for you
Power girl, power girl
Let me show you what it do, aye
Workin' on me and you all day (all day)
Makin' sure what we have is safe, doin' it all (ooh)
She's over the city (she's over the city)
She go there if she been there (she go there if she been there)
I'm only one nigga (I'm only one nigga)
I can't be everywhere (ooh)
But I can take you anywhere, I know I swear, power girl

[Chorus: Khalid]
Power girl
I really wanna know your ways
I really wanna know your ways
I really wanna know your ways (wanna know, I wanna know)
I really want a power girl
You been runnin' through my section all day
You been runnin' through my mind all day
All day, all day, all day, all day, yeah, uh

[Outro: Swae Lee]
Power girl out in the city, some niggas, they out in the city
Goin' nowhere, girl, you doin' in it
Goin' everywhere, girl, you don't need it
Goin' everywhere, what you doin' in it?
Power girl, why you move in the city?
Do you know, girl, girl, you know the city?
You over the city, you over the city
Power girl, yeah, she's over the city
Hourglass, yeah, she turned it over
Power girl, yeah, she's over the city
Hourglass, yeah, she turned it over
