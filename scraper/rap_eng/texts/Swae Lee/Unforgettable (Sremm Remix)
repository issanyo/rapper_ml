[Chorus: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink, but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

[Verse: Slim Jxmmi & Swae Lee]
I been drinkin' too much to hold back (hey)
Put the Hennessy on ice and throw it back (fuck it)
I might push up on it,  'cause I want that (fuck it)
Can't help but think about cuffing (yeah)
She wine (wine) like a island girl
Before I leave I got to talk to her (yeah)
Bad ting, she's a bad ting (bad ting)
Very bad ting, she's a bad ting (whoo)
And you ain't gotta say it, baby I can read you just fine (just fine)
Play hard to get every single time (single time)
But I get you every single time, hmm
Hey girl, I caught onto your good vibe
Dirty wine, baby, dirty wine (whoo)
Let's leave the club, I got a dirty mind, girl
(Whoo, Uncle Jim)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (oeh)
Why not?
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do
