[Intro]
Hey, hey
Hey
Chopsquad
Ooh
In the heat of the moment, I know I can...
Yeah
DJ the beast on this banger!

[Chorus]
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself

[Verse 1]
It's no suggestion comin' from me, I'm just somebody that cares
And you can front like you don't feel me, you most definitely care
And if there's some kinda hold on your love or your heart then baby, why lie?
You're killin' me like a homicide, needin' more excitement for your double life
Here's the drugs for your sore eyes, from friends that are hard to come by
Let's just hope that my phones don't die, so you can reach me
I know I'm changin' for sure, lay in the lowest of love
And you saw me transform and there was no cure

[Chorus]
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself

[Verse 2]
I wonder sometimes, if the one that's passed me by
I wonder sometimes, if somebody's lovin' you right
Table's turned all of a sudden, ridin' by my side, like on a trollie
Father, God, they want my money, heart on fire, they never could crush it
Twisting up my dialogue, sorry, but I'm wide-wide eye buggin'
Something else you need from me but would you even take a bullet?
Let me buy your time even though I wiped off your kiss
And I shouldn't say too much because it's what I do that really sinks in

[Chorus]
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself
