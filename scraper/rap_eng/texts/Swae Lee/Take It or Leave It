[Hook: Swae Lee]
I spill the cup for you, take it or leave it
I saved some room for you, take it or leave it
I gotta crazy view, take it or leave it
I got love for you, take it or leave it
I know you pick up on the very first ring
Let's go somewhere where we can just be unseen
I'm reachin' out to you, take it or leave it
Reachin' out to you, take it or leave it

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
She wanna ride
I just want some time when I'm fried
She bad as fuck
But I know she would bury me alive
Just say that it's dead
If you wanna live on a lot
If you get in the mood
I want you to keep me in mind
I got the booze, we can rendezvous
Jump inside, baby, we can cruise
Don't be led by the goddamn fools
Yeah, right beside me, you cannot lose

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I spill the cup for you, take it or leave it
I saved some room for you, take it or leave it
I gotta crazy view, take it or leave it
I got love for you, take it or leave it
I know you pick up on the very first ring
Let's go somewhere where we can just be unseen
I'm reachin' out to you, take it or leave it
Reachin' out to you, take it or leave it

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Remember how you held me down
When all I had was a vision
I could cop a model bitch but
You the one that I'm missin'
Girl, I hope you get this message
And I pray that you hit me
Cause you the one that's on my mind
Late night when I'm driftin'
Pour a shot for me, pour a shot for you
I'm still around cause I fuck with you
Just say the word, we can go missin'
Long as we together, it don't make a difference

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I spill the cup for you, take it or leave it

Let's go somewhere where we can just be unseen
I'm reachin' out to you, take it or leave it
Reachin' out to you, take it or leave it
