[Intro: Henry Draw]
I’ma be honest, I can’t sing for shit
Mike WiLL Made-It
I’ma just keep the Swae hook
Mally Mall
It’s easier, and everyone loves it
‘Skeetit
Ear Drummers
Yeah, ho

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
What's in ya' mug? Toasted up, nah, I ain't hostin'
Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't wanna roll it
I was slidin' in the Lamb' with the powerglide
Slime green paint, peanut butter inside
She wanna fuck, speak up, comin' out her clothes (clothes)
I'm in wonderland when she comin' down the pole
And I don't care if she take all of mine
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign

[Verse 1: Henry Draw]
Yeah, it just a dollar sign ho, don’t you know that?
Why you J-ealous, cause we don’t have to worry about the Price Tag?
I could be blowin’ some racks up in the club
But I’m Discord callin’ my girl and we makin’ fun of the school
Cause they burnt up, yeah I’m just tryin’ be real
I don’t see the deal in really making stories up
Pettin’ yo’ friend’s pup is just as great as smokin’ loud
Most of these suckers doing homework, say they high as a cloud
I just wanna straight with y’all
Want my lyrics to be real, be meta, S tier
Wanna be a white 2 Chainz
Wanna make shit up but not like “I’m getting brain”
I just want people to know me like I’m Brian
Enjoy my art, but know I’m a person deep inside
Enough with ranting, so now we just gonna glide
And be witty, and silly, and make shit up
Like “did you just put some Jolly Ranchers in that there cup?”

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
What's in ya' mug? Toasted up, nah, I ain't hostin'
Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't wanna roll it
I was slidin' in the Lamb' with the powerglide
Slime green paint, peanut butter inside
She wanna fuck, speak up, comin' out her clothes (clothes)
I'm in wonderland when she comin' down the pole
And I don't care if she take all of mine
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign

[Verse 2: Henry Draw, Swae Lee, Both]
Aye, I make big moves, I got sticks too
And I got choppers that are hittin’ off some licks, too
I got panda colored clothes, a Lil Pump that’s pointin’ Vert
Large fin, manta ray, Johnson, you a squirt
My skills in tip-top shape like I’m Cole
And I’m the real train conductor, North Pole, key coal
You the type of dude that think it’s cool to have your Mii have a mole
And I got tigers, growl like Perry, just like Katy, hear them Roar
From a platypus to lion, like an Animorph
Little shorty caught my eye, like a fuckin’ dwarf
And I’m rollin’ through the wharf in a Rolls Royce Phantom
And I swear this is all canon, not a mouse, I won’t dismantle
Goin’ platinum like a rouge shootin’ star
Get right outta here, I’ll smoke you like a ‘gar
The feds just caught you, like a moth trapped in a jar
Prototype cars, not a Jaguar (skkrt)

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Henry Draw]
What's in ya' mug? Toasted up, nah, I ain't hostin'
Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't wanna roll it
I was slidin' in the Lamb' with the powerglide
Slime green paint, peanut butter inside
She wanna fuck, speak up, comin' out her clothes (clothes)
I'm in wonderland when she comin' down the pole
And I don't care if she take all of mine
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign
