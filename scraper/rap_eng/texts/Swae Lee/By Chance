[Intro]
These yours?
Yeah
Itâ€™s purp, purp purp, yeah

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Bad bitch with a tan
Do you know one by chance?
Hundred bands in the Lamb'
Do you have one by chance?
Need to see the Xan man
Do you know him by chance?
A Ziploc full of kush
Are you plugged in, by chance?
Bad bitch with a suntan
Do you know one by chance?
Hundred bands in the Lamb'
Do you have one by chance?
Need to see the Xan man
Do you know him by chance?
A Ziploc full of kush
Are you plugged in, by chance?

[Verse 1: Swae Lee & (Slim Jxmmi)]
Pick a price for me, please
We can spend whatever
Camera lights bounce off my shiny bezel
Kill the lights, would you? I am on my level
Flexin' like I've been up in the gym forever
All these bitches give me brain, damn they sure is clever
I took a bitch out, let her shop 'til she drop
All these big bags come at once like nonstop
Ridin' droptop so I can't even hotbox
We can spend whatever
Young Swae Lee, damn, check out my bezel
I blow lots of cash cause I won't live forever (do it)

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
I'm thumbin' through the cash, damn my pockets got a leech
You tryna roll with me, you gotta be a 10 at least
Mona Lisa with a Visa vibin' to the beat
No she not a keeper, she just my little freak
Hotbox the coupe and we fuckin' in it
I do what I do, and the bitches dig it
Straight out the blue, I got your attention (she love it, man)
Was it the coupe or the watch glistenin'?
I'm winnin', mane, I'm winnin', chain yellow like the Simpsons
I'm pimpin' like I'm Lennon, got a lot of foreign women
They can't control my spendin', fuck it, I ain't got no limit
Tippin', Slim Jxmmi!
We can spend whatever

[Outro: Slim Jxmmi & Swae Lee]
Name a price, we can spend whatever
Since I am, let's spend forever
Since I lost, it's been forever
Yeah, we can spend forever (Swae)
