[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Let the top down for some ventilation (yeah)
Touchscreen navigation, get me to my destination
If you can't get over me, it's because the good vibrations
50 large in my pants like what? (Hey) Like what's the occasion?

[Verse]
Just dunked a girl in the pool
There's plenty room in my SUV when I'm on the avenue
Rich bitch, I'm on to you
If it's mine, it ain't up for grabs
I make 'em pay me in cash
If the last didn't last
It's 'cause they didn't love you like they should have
So I'll get you from the train station
Know you don't mind, so I'll have the tree waitin'
If it's on my mind then it's on yours too
I'll make the first move and I guarantee you'll call me back, yeah
Cupid got a bounty on me (on me)
Trouble done found you
Banded up 'cause you're callin' (ooh)
Banded up 'cause you're callin' (yeah)
And I was homesick these past Februaries
Runnin' around hopin' payback was sweet
Money up, now we really flexin'
I take it out of park like

[Chorus]
Let the top down for some ventilation (yeah)
Touchscreen navigation, get me to my destination
If you can't get over me, it's because the good vibrations
50 large in my pants like, what? (Hey) Like what's the occasion?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Let the top down for some ventilation (yeah)
Touchscreen navigation, get me to my destination
If you can't get over me, it's because the good vibrations
50 large in my pants like, what? (Hey) Like what's the occasion?
