[Intro: Drake]
ASS, yeay
Penis down
Fucking hell
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Ay, ay, ay
My dog probably has down syndrome
That's how just how it is
We don't know what to do
I tried to shoot 'em
Yeah, Yeay, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea...
Go on send the pics
Back in high school, I used to go sucko mode (Suck my dick)
Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, tities

[Verse 1: Drake]
Back in high school, I used to bust a lot of nuts
Back in high school, I used to nut into the thots (Yeey)
Now I hit my ass with busses in my hands
Back in high school, I used to bust it to my hands (Yeey)
I did sucky sucky
When I shoot my nut
That shit wet like my cock
Ni**as think I'm sweet
I'm in love with my feet
I go sucko mode
Ah, aah

[Interlude 1: PewDiePie]
That's how sucko mode works (Ah!)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Look bitches eat me like I'm a bowl of soup
Steak's too big
When they pull up, they give me poop
Now I gotta poo (Oh shit)
This shit way too gay
I'm gonna jump off a cliff
All of these hoes, mane, they've got different colored shoes
And they slippin (Oof!)

[Interlude 2: Swae Lee & Big Hawk]
Sauce, sauce
Pla-pla-playing with kids?

[Verse 3: Drake]
Seven sexty seven
Man, I shit inside the bedroom
And I still got crap to sell
Man, I crapped on the block
I go sucko mode
