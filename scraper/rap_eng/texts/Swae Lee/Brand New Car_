Damn her hair standin' up
She just wanna party though
She heard we be blowin' money
Turn it into particles
When we hit the fuckin' city
We gon' make the articles
Yeah, yeah
Catch me veerin' in the median
I'm in that brand new ghost
When I pull up to the club
You know the hoes gon' touch their toes
Countin' bills, fuckin' hoes simultaneous
That girl so spontaneous
And she give me cranium
I might pull up with a DVD
And DVD your ho
Catch me flyin' down the median
I'm blowin' fuckin' smoke
I might blow it out the gas
Means I'm blowin' out my nose
Yeah you know I let that money talk
That paper fuckin' spoke
Ayy, drop top Vipers, we get all our food to go
I might take the top up off that bitch
And put it on the floor
You can't see me in the spot
I'm higher than a UFO
I got bitches out in London
And got hoes in Tokyo, let's go

Every dog has his day
Sick 'em, sick 'em
Lil' nigga you can hate
Jig 'em, jig 'em
Hundred G's on the table
Flip 'em, flip 'em
Everybody ain't able
Drill 'em, drill 'em
Got a duplex with a crazy view
Throw the cash up, make her hula hoop
Pinkie ring on igloo
Backwoods crushin' grapefruit juice
Pull a 60 out the pouch like a kangaroo

Told y'all I wasn't fuckin' playin'
Say you love me, bitch, say it don't spray it
Blow the 50s layer by layer, yeah

Snuck backstage with no wristband
Tryna ride me like [?]
[?] tap dance
[?] middle man
Light head on my waist
Yeah I got good taste
I've been livin' on the edge
So I can't play it safe
Take a reality check
All of my niggas [?]
[?] jumbo jet
