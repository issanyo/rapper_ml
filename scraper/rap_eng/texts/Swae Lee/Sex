[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi & Blac Youngsta]
(Gang, Gang, Gang, Gang, Gang)
Foreign Car, (Gang) like a Jet (Gang, Gang), we can have (Gang) all kind of sex (Gang, Gang)
I just wrecked, tryna text, where you at? girl lemme bron-in-it
Young nigga flex (Gang, Gang), make her wet (Gang), Young nigga stretch, hit a lick
Girl where you at I'm tryna hit, swallow, gargle, spit, spit
(Gang, Gang, Gang, Gang, Gang !)

[Verse 1: Blac Youngsta]
Baby let me know if you really do love me
Big baby know I really do trust you (I put you through too much)
Baby you know you bought a real, true thugger
I been down with the gang from the jump
I been running with them thangs in my trunk
Had a strong campaign from the jump
And you dissed me for the fame, from the jump
You fuck boy, you going to jail, dropping so fuckin pumps
Broke is a game, nigga you'll get slump
Hundred kush bowls in the trunk (Gang, Gang)
And I ran the money up with unc bitch
Why I open sit on double pump
And that nigga you were in the cell with
He was sucking your dick on your bunk
If you a man you gotta stand for something
Real bosses don't pass the blunt
If you gonna brag on another nigga
You might as well kiss his ass or something
I won't wast my breath on you niggas
But I don't even got my ass in the pump
Bitches getting their asses pumped

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi & Blac Youngsta]
(Gang, Gang, Gang, Gang, Gang)

Young nigga flex (Gang, Gang), make her wet (Gang), Young nigga stretch, hit a lick
Girl where you at I'm tryna hit, swallow, gargle, spit, spit
(Gang, Gang, Gang, Gang, Gang !)

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi & Blac Youngsta]
My nigga he just cam up out the dirt (Dirt, Dirt)
I pay my dues, but nigga I put in work (Put in work)
My nigga he in feds, he doing time (time, time)
I lost so many my niggas, I lost my mind (My mind)
I his restitution, so he fine (Fine)
I hate they gave my little nigga all that time (Time)
I jumped out that drop, that's perfect timing (time, time)
I jumped up off that block I work for mine
I'm thinking' bout success, that's on my mind (My mind)
I'm thinking 'bout these murders and them crimes (crimes)
I'm thinking 'bout my fam that's on my mind
Fuck with masses going down, yeah
