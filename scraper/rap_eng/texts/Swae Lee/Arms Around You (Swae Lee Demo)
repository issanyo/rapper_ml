{Intro: Swae Lee]
Yeah, yeah
Ohhh
Ohh, yeah

[Verse: Swae Lee]
If you ever get to feel my touch
Then you might never get enough
Yes, I know you feel the ambiance (Hey)
Love you like I'll never see you again
Only real 'cause I'm not for pretend (No)
Reaching out with your arms extended
My love is emergency and I can sense the urgency (Ya-aah)
Come, let me, woah-oh-oh
Your body is just for me (For me)
It was like sorcery
She left me like an alcoholic
Find more time, I wish I could just buy more
Honey's my life, appreciate me now-now-now
Finesse more time, I wish it cold be better
I want you more than I want bottles

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION, Swae Lee]
Arms around you
Te amo, mami, let me hold you
Got me arms right around you, girl, oyy (all around you
Got loving arms all around you
To make sure no one could harm you
Dale mami, let me have you, ooyyy
