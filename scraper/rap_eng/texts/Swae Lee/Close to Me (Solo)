[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
Even though we both know we're liars and we start each other's fires
We just know that we'll be alright
Even though we're kicked out the party 'cause we both hate everybody
We're the ones they wanna be like

[Pre-Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me

[Verse 2: Ellie Goulding]
Let's be honest
We only break up 'cause we love the way we make up
Naked, rolling round on broken plates
Let's be honest
We were together because we both predators
In this superficial world, we're okay

[Pre-Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
Close to me

[Break: Ellie Goulding]
Close to me
Yeah, close to me

[Bridge: Ellie Goulding]
'Cuz i'm an animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me
Because I'm an animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
Close to me

[Outro: Ellie Goulding]
(To me)
Close to me
