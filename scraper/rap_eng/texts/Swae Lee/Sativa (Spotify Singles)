[Verse 1]
Is it hot in here or is it just me?
I'm so high in here, been smokin' on this weed
Told 'em, "Go on, take a shot on three"
Told 'em, "Drinks is on me"
Yeah, the drinks are on me
I said now go and take a shot on me
Only drug a bitch is on is the tree
But I lasted ten rounds like a freak
Like a G

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah, get ready
Oh, we're on
Oh yeah, I'm ready
Please hold the phone
Oh yeah, I'm ready
Oh, we're on
Where you gon' be at?
Later on, oh

[Chorus]
Why you make it so complicated? (mmh)
Off the drink, we concentratin'
I know you won't leave me hangin'
Smokin' weed out the container (yeah)
We spend cash for our entertainment
There's more where that came from, that's all I'm sayin'
It's me and you and we makin' arrangements
It's you and me and we makin' arrangements

[Verse 2]
I'll keep it simple, baby (yeah)
I'ma keep it simple with you, baby
You know I don't ever play no games
You know I don't ever complicate it (complicate it)
Got me feelin' some type of way
Concentratin', concentratin' on the way
You keep the rhythm
Oh my God, I'm glad you came
You came through with that sativa
Indica be havin' me stuck
You know just how to keep me up
You know it, better believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah, I'm ready
Oh, we're on
I said I'm ready
Hold the phone
Get ready
I am on one (yeah)
Where you gon' be at? (where you gon' be at?)
Later on, later on, oh

[Outro]
Why you make it so complicated?
Off the drink, we concentratin' (yeah)
I know you won't leave me hangin' (won't leave me hangin')
Smokin' weed out the container (yeah, yeah)
We spend cash for our entertainment (hey)
There's more where that came from, that's all I'm sayin'
It's me and you and we makin' arrangements
You and me, me and you and we makin' arrangements
So I'ma let you...
Dive in that, mmh won't you dive in that?
Dive in that, mmh please won't you dive in that?
Dive in that, oh won't you dive in that?
Dive in that, oh won't you dive in that?
Oh, we're on
