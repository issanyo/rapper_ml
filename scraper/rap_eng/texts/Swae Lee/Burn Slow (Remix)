[Hook: Swae Lee]
Burn slow, burn slow
Burn slow, burn slow
Burn slow, burn slow
Burn slow, burn slow

[Verse: Slim Jxmmi]
Three grams in my Century Sam
Let me roll, it's gon' feel like a Cuban Cigar in your hands, SremmLife shit!
Big blunts of the skunk, hit it slow, feel the smoke in your lungs
Hippy bitches love the shit that I'm on, hippy bitches treat my dick like a bong
I kick shit in cassels, I'm high but you can't tell
My pack loud as Adel, this Kushy Kush
Me and my California hoe might burn a whole ounce
Ash on the floor and the couch, fuck on the floor and the couch

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Burn slow, burn slow
Burn slow, burn slow
Burn slow, burn slow
Burn slow, burn slow
