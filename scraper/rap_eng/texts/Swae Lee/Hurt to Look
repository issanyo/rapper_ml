[Chorus]
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (hey, ah-ah, ah)
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (your way, ah-ah, ah)
I shouldn't have to catch a case (ah-ah, ah yeah)
'Cause I'm the one that can't stand to feel any more pain (ah-ah, ooh)

[Verse 1]
I can feel the weight of what you say (ooh, ooh)
I had explanations for days (ooh, ooh)
Don't think you're the only one that's sane
It seems like we're not on the same page
All I do is think when I'm away (when I'm away)
Colors burst and all I see are shapes (hey!)
Sun goes away and that's when I call your name (your name)
She's here for good, and I'm here to stay

[Chorus]
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (hey, ah-ah, ah)
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (your way, ah-ah, ah)
I shouldn't have to catch a case (ah-ah, ah yeah)
'Cause I'm the one that can't stand to feel any more pain (ah-ah, ooh)

[Verse 2]
She said the E was for missin' my embrace (yeah, oh-oh)
So yeah, I feel so out of place (woo, oh yeah)
I was meant to love and protect you
You know what's on my mind, but not what's in my heart
Give me someone to connect to (to)
Because these drinks are hitting me a little hard

[Chorus]
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (hey, ah-ah, ah)
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (your way, ah-ah, ah)
I shouldn't have to catch a case (ah-ah, ah yeah)
'Cause I'm the one that can't stand to feel any more pain (ah-ah, ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah-ah, ooh, yeah
It shouldn't hurt to look your way
It shouldn't hurt
It shouldn't hurt to look your way
It shouldn't hurt, it shouldn't hurt
Let me fuck with it real quick
