[Intro:]

Swae Lee: Yeah! Swae Lee, (Southside)


[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Losing receipts, leaving the store we don't do it medium
Greenbacks giving me freedom, that's why I need them, I mean immediately
Keep a bad bitch, she disobedient
Ice- Ice on my necklace, I am a skier
My style's in season, no matter the season
I'm playing with the cash, I'm playing fetch, I make her retrieve em
They stay at the drag of my feet, I stick to the speed limit
They playing ???, my paycheck is Fiji
We smoke gas, this is that helium
Huffing and pass it, it taste like it's ????
Married to the hundreds, I'm kneeling
She said she want ???
I done got to ???, now I"m walking on the ceiling
Oh, you may ???, coupe you may recede it
Damn, she was a ???, I'm disagreeing
I'm fly, I don't need a wing man
She's rich, she's fucking not teasing
Thought you was doing it like me, but, you were just dreaming
I sweat out the money, I ??? I'm on Fendi
My wrist a compass, bust down the circumference
She foreign as can be, soon as we greet, we kiss on both cheeks
I'm picking up wings, I'm picking up speed, I'm taking the lead

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
We doing it big, they doing it medium, medium
We do it large, they doing it medium
Louis V black tee, I'll take it ???
You keep the odds, I'll take em Even Steven (yeah)
We doing it big, they doing it medium, medium
We do it large, they doing it medium

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Sippin on iced tea, kickin' like ???
Getting money like a ???, cuz I'm a Black Beatle
If she's fine as Venus then she's fine as Serena (yeah)


[Chorus: Swae Lee]
We doing it big, they doing it medium, medium
We do it large, they doing it medium
Louis V black tee, I'll take it ???
You keep the odds, I'll take em Even Steven (yeah)
We doing it big, they doing it medium, medium
We do it large, they doing it medium
