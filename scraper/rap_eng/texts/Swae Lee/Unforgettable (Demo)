[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink, but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do
You don't gotta search hard to find me
With the money is where I'll be
With the cash, yeah, that's where I'll be
Give it up, baby, no stopping

[Chorus: Wizkid]
My gyal
You bad, You bad
But mi no want this forever
Oh yeah
My gyal, you bad, you bad, you bad
But mi no want this forever
Ooh yeah

[Bridge: Wizkid]
Would you leave with me tonight?
Get high, get fucked with me tonight?
I don't want this thing for life
My gyal come rock with me tonight

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
I can provide the good vibe
I keep a hot one by my side
And if you choose then you better chose wisely
Me not coming in clutch is unlikely
You're gonna hurt somebody
The way you move your waist you're gonna hurt somebody
You don't owe nobody nothing
Girl, what you got for me?
What you got for me?
I love you long time, that's a guarantee
I switch time zones just to come see
I got your mind blown, yeah, easy
Don't want to fall, just want to taste
Tell me yes, don't reply maybe
Why we gotta do so much talking?
I'm tryna make it through the crowd, baby

[Chorus: Wizkid]
You bad, you bad
But mi no want this forever
Forever

[Verse 3: Swae Lee (& Wizkid)]
You know what your body wants to do
Why you gotta think this through (ooh yeah)
You fucking with the midnight crew
Playing your favorite tunes
You tryna find that feel from way back when
I'm speeding with the roof caved in
You can say that somebody's out to get ya
I'm for real, ain't nobody filthy richer
Give me that look one more time, baby
Yeah, It's over
I got the Colorado pack, it's over
Yeah, yeah
I make time for what I want
Meet me back at the room
Since you're in the mood
You're gonna hurt somebody
The way you move your waist you're gonna hurt somebody
You don't owe nobody nothing...

[Outro: Swae Lee]
Drug me
I'm smoking, blowing Os, and feeling stars
Getting so high off my supply
I do it so easy, I don't try
Can't you see yourself with me tonight?
I don't want to hurt you, fuss, and fight
I'm gon' do you make you close your eyes
All in favor, please say I
Call your job and tell them you'll be late
