[Intro: Swae Lee]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, "490!"
808 Mafia


[Chorus: Swae Lee]
$490 on a Saint Laurent tank
But baby I don't wanna break the bank
I show up always fashionably late
I took a knee just for the hate
$490 on a Saint Laurent tank
But baby I don't wanna break the bank
I show up always fashionably late
I'm doing 90 on the straightaway, yeah

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
I call my girl the {?}
I keep some bad bitches, you don't say? (Hey!)
Let's chow down if it's gourmet
I'm pretty sure the coupe came straight from space

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
$490 on a Saint Laurent tank
But baby I don't wanna break the bank
I show up always fashionably late
I took a knee just for the hate
$490 on a Saint Laurent tank
But baby I don't wanna break the bank
I show up always fashionably late
I'm doing 90 on the straightaway, yeah

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
{?} more money to face
$490 and I wear that shit for days
Throw up lifestyle, don't say?
I can't take this to the grave
Many mansions man {?} like Kim Kardashian
Jimmy Neutron, can't believe I'm blastin'
Jump up out the driver side, race car jacket
Girls in the pool but they finna splash in


[Chorus: Swae Lee]
$490 on a Saint Laurent tank
But baby I don't wanna break the bank
I show up always fashionably late
I took a knee just for the hate
$490 on a Saint Laurent tank
But baby I don't wanna break the bank
I show up always fashionably late
I'm doing 90 on the straightaway, yeah
