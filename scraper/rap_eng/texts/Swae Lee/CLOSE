[Intro: Swae Lee]
30, you a fool for this one
Oh, C-L-O-S-E
Ear Drummers
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
One rope in the chain, yeah, lightin' propane, yeah
Dousin' the flame, yeah, bounce for some change, yeah
Gang can't be tamed, yeah, ice in our veins, yeah
Somethin' feels strange, this cup is dangerous
Somethin' ain't right, dawg (yeah), we in too easy (yeah)
Been here all night, dawg, really, I'm tweakin', yeah (it's lit)
Lookin' to pipe some, ass in the party, look like a pageant (pop it)
If we gon' fight some, beat it and dash it, lawyer do magic (alright)

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Love right up my avenue (ooh) but thatâ€™s just not up my avenue (no)
You cried and said, "Look what you made me do" (you made me do)
It's not my fault that I don't wanna end up screwed (ooh)
And everything I'm tryna say, you beat me to it (to it)
And all the ups and all the downs, we have been through it (through it)
Now you're C-L-O-S-E (you're too close), you're too C-L-O-S-E to me (you're so close)

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
C-L-O-S-E (it's ruined)
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me
C-L-O-S-E to me (it's ruined)
I mean, seriously, can I breathe?
C-L-O-S-E
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me
You're too C-L-O-S-E to me (yeah, C-L-O-S-E)
You're so C-L-O-S-E (yeah) (Jxm, ayy)

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
You know I'm a dog and I can't control it (dog)
Wanna settle someday but not at the moment (wanna settle someday)
I'ma stack up the cake like Obama told me (gotta stack up the cake)
Niggas smile in your face and they're not your homie (too close)
Makin' me claustrophobic (claustrophobic), bust down the AP and wet the Rollie (bust it down)
Stop callin' me "brother," you barely know me (I'm not your bro)
Don't tell me you love me, you gotta show me (don't tell me you love me)
I'm so anti (Jxm), gotta get paid to go outside (woo)
Blowin' on the strong like "How High" (blowin' on strong)
Haters still watch from the sideline (haters still watchin')
Sremm and La Flame on the incline (incline)
Mixin' up brands, it's drip time (drip)
Stuck to the plan, had to get mine (get mine)
Stayed down and it paid off big time

[Bridge: Swae Lee]
So many, so many drugs
You only get so many, so many tries
So many, so many tries
You only get so many, so many tries
So many, so many tries
You only get so many, so many tries
So many, so many tries
You only get so many, so many tries

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
C-L-O-S-E (ooh)
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me (you know)
C-L-O-S-E to me (you made me do)
I mean, seriously, can I breathe? (Ooh)
C-L-O-S-E (through it)
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me (through it)
You're too C-L-O-S-E to me (you're too close)
You're so C-L-O-S-E (you're so close)
