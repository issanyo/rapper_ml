Everybody in the club drops their glasses, every time I walk in a room the bitches be attractive
They lashing out for my money, it's so funny
My pockets never empty, i'm a robot dummy
Try and hit me hard as you can and i'm pretty damn sure you'll break your hand
I'm pretty damn sure you'll fall where you stand
Man just land and be happy, no need for fights because
I try to be the happiest with all my might
The bitches get me every time, they so tight
I'm tired from the day so i'll say goodnight
