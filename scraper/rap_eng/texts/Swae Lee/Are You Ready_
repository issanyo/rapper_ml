[Pre-Hook: Swae Lee]
Baby, I'mma gon' and put your panties to the side
Might well go and tell me how you want it right now
Might well go and mix my cup for just a light
Might well call your friend cause y'all look just alike

[Hook: Bobo Swae]
Are you ready?
Cause I'm ready
Let's go get it
Are you with it?
Hit the city
Find some bitches
Bring 'em home
Turn 'em on

[Verse: Swae Lee]
And I'm always in here for you when you call
Diamonds dancing on your body drop it [?]
Might well call them hoes that always out to meet ya
Might as well [?]
I was seeing on your wave but we the wave
Either way it goes I know I'll get the win
Can I see you on the park ya on the [?]
Let me see you in the club you on the table
Cameras caught you in the mansion now you fired
Everything you did around us on the live
Even if I get your pussy I want it now
Cook your shit and tuck your shit I want you now

[Pre-Hook: Swae Lee]
Baby, I'mma gon' and put your panties to the side
Might well go and tell me how you want it right now
Might well go and mix my cup for just a light
Might well call your friend cause y'all look just alike

[Hook: Bobo Swae]
Are you ready?
Cause I'm ready
Let's go get it
Are you with it?
Hit the city
Find some bitches
Bring 'em home
Turn 'em on

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Something foreign don't know why I'm driving it
I've been drinking all day and night
I've been scheming all day and night
Bad bitches that's the type I like
I'mma put some more ice in my cup
When I pour that shit up
Its gon' have me feeling realer
Burberry with my naked jeans
Man that shit look clean when I rock it with Moschin
Shawty thought she was a freak turned her to a fiend
Only thing I fuck with is them bad queens

[Pre-Hook: Swae Lee]
Baby, I'mma gon' and put your panties to the side
Might well go and tell me how you want it right now
Might well go and mix my cup for just a light
Might well call your friend cause y'all look just alike

[Hook: Bobo Swae]
Are you ready?
Cause I'm ready
Let's go get it
Are you with it?
Hit the city
