We live in a purgatory, you're supposed to know this shit
We're supposed to live in a happy land so put down that clip
Make me rich motherfuckers, bring in that gold
I still have a hard time following orders and being told
What I'm supposed to do is not what you're supposed to do
Focus on your own life and make yourself true
Being true to yourself is key if you want to live in this serenity
Let the jokers laugh, they just be jokers
Let your words lead the path to a thousand soldiers
Friends come first in this world here so pretend not to hear that doubt in your ear
Look up to the heavens and find the light
When you cross the crossed line you will feel that delight
And know that you're your own best interest at heart
Try to keep your world from falling apart
Everything has a balance so it's always not fine and peachy
Just listen to what I say because i'm so nice and preachy
