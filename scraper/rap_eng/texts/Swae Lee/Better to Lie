[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
Sometimes, it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Jesse Rutherford]
Small dog in that big town
Little dog in that big pound
If you can't bite, then just sit down
Better fight it, just quit now
Full of bull like a pit now
Talking shit with that big mouth
Get written out that script, ouch (Bye)
Like a fish out of the water, this only gets harder
Feels like I just started, no time to get caught
I been working on me, therapy once a week
It ain't cheap, but I'd rather pay the fee
Instead of cheat on you

[Pre-Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
Now you could hate me, I don't mind
Yeah, you could hate me, I don't mind
Yeah, you could hate me, I don't mind
Yeah, you could hate me, I don't mind

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
Sometimes, it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Killin' the vibes, killin' the vibes
All of this waitin' around, killin' the vibes
Sellin' you dreams, wasting time that I can't buy
Wouldn't give me peace of mind
Attitudes seem to change when we roll up
How'd it taste when you taste your own medicine?
Quality of my life isn't low budget
Gave me all dirty looks when I look back

[Pre-Chorus: Swae Lee]
You can hate me, I don't mind
You can hate me, I don't mind
You can hate me, I don't mind
You can hate me, I don't mind

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
Sometimes, it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Lil Dicky]
Pretty good ending, huh?
