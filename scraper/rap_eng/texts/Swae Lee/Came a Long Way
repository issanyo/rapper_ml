Now, grind like a rich nigga, shine like a rich nigga
Ridin' round town, hey, hey
Ridin' round town, top down like a rich nigga
Wishin' that somebody say hey, hey
Choppin' all the bad bitches wanna come around
Man you know I'm tryna make her body break, hey
Pop a Lortab now I'm feelin' real weird
Now I'm feelin' real floaty everyday, hey
Wish a nigga would say I ain't got cash
Man, I throw all the 100s in your face, hey
In the strip club, Magic City, what's up
What's really goin' down in the A? Hey
Out in LA, out-out in LA
Secret Sunday, hangin' with your babes, hey
You know how we do it man, you know how we do it
Young nigga, I done came a long way, hey

[Post-Hook: Slim Jxmmi]
Young nigga, I done came a long way, hey
Young nigga, I done came a long way
Came a long way
Young nigga, I done came a long way

[Verse 1: Slim Jxmmi]
Came a long way from the sip
Livin' on the edge, I don't never slip
Strippers in my bed, bed tryna flip
Tryna get that bread, out that money clip
All the young niggas what I represent
Pockets on swole cause I stay committed
Let my top down when I'm in the city
It's a celebration when I'm in the city
Yeah, all my niggas here
Feel like we a 100 deep in here
I keep it real with ya, if you keep it real
I can't worry 'bout the hate cause the money real
If you from the bottom, you know how I feel
Pocket full of money, everything chill
Through the bullshit, I remain ill
Through the bullshit, I remain real

[Hook: Slim Jxmmi]
Now, grind like a rich nigga, shine like a rich nigga
Ridin' round town, hey, hey
Ridin' round town, top down like a rich nigga
Wishin' that somebody say hey, hey

Secret Sunday, hangin' with your babes, hey
You know how we do it man, you know how we do it
Young nigga, I done came a long way, hey

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
What a journey
All the broke shit don't concern me
Chinchilla hella furry
Catch me on a yacht eatin' curry
I don't do drugs, naw, I don't do drugs
I'm the motherfuckin' drugs, do me
Bad bitch dancin' in my head like
She say she wanna fuck, and I told her feel free
I got a new spot in Cali, but I can't tell you the addy
Cause I stay up on the road
If I ever write a book about the shit I been through
It'd be the greatest story ever told
She get money off the floor
We gettin' paid like so
Backwood in my ear, LV money clippin'
If you see the state trooper, man, hit it
