[Intro: Josh Groom]
What
Hahaha

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type,  (nah)
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like,  (woo)
You ain't got no life,  (nah)
Cups with the ice and we do this every night,  (woo)
I ain't check the price, (I got it)
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like,  (woo)
I'm just living life,  (hey, hey)
And let my momma tell it, nigga, I ain't living right, (Lee)

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Chop the top off the Porsche
That's a headless horse
Extendo long as an extension cord
Bitch, I ball like Jordan
And I play full court
If you not my type
Then you know I got to keep this shit short
What you know about a check?
What you got up in your pocket?
What you spending when you shopping, dawg?
Why you wanna go flex?
Like you all in the mix
Like you got some shit popping off
I got some models that you see up in the movies
And they want to make a flick for the camera
Wanna be Kim Kardashian
Heard I was living like a bachelor

[Hook: Swae Lee]

[Verse 2: Josh Groom]
I ain't living right
I don't know what to choose
I'm at a crossroads in my life and I'm singing blues
I don't know what to do
And all I want to do is go through this shit with you
Uh
And I'm lonely (damn)
It's me, myself and I only
Goddamn, Goddamn and if you told me
That this was how I'd end up I'da stayed low key
And homie I swear to god
I'd pick up if you tried to phone me
And now I'm sold see
Fuck the concept of putting money first, G
Bro I put people over profit
There ain't no way to stop it
And SremmLife I am finna cop it
Yeah

[Hook: Swae Lee]

[Outro: Josh Groom]
Yeah
