[Intro: Swae Lee]
I see you, oh

[Bridge: Swae Lee]
She said I can't slow down
If I wanted to
We live for this shit, yeah
We truly do
I know you do
Oh, I know you do
I know you do, too
Cause you just like us, yeah

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
You love that spotlight
That spotlight that never goes out
You call your friends up
Your ride is out and say, "let's go out"
You mix that drank up that drank up
And show all out
You wanna scream and shout
Ain't no turnin' down
It ain't no more daddy's little girl
Don't you feel like you can take on the world?
You ain't worried 'bout nobody sneak dissin'
You just glad to be the center of attention
Ay, gon' and put your hands up, put 'em up, up, up
Come and try this shit I'm on, tell me when you had enough
All the girls on the loose, fuck is up, up, up?
We gon' tear this bitch up, who's with us, us, us?

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I done seen stars a million times
And they only come out at night
How come they only shine bright at night?
Uh
Been around, seen stars all my life
They only come out at night
They only come out at night
Just like us

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Woke up faded, still drunk from yesterday
Last night was crazy, last night was wavy
Came a 100 deep, we wasn't even on the list
We was in the buildin', big bottles of prometh
I'm in the moment, only thinkin' 'bout right now
You know the lifestyle, we up all night now
Come here baby, let me take you on a trip
Don't you love nights like this

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I done seen stars a million times
And they only come out at night
How come they only shine bright at night?
Uh
Been around, seen stars all my life
They only come out at night
They only come out at night
Just like us, damn

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
You wanna scream and shout
You wanna scream and shout
It ain't no more daddy's little girl
Don't you feel like you can take on the world?
You wanna scream and shout
Ain't no turnin' down

[Bridge: Swae Lee]
She said I can't slow down
If I wanted to
We live for this shit, yeah
We truly do
I know you do
Oh, I know you do
I know you do too
Cause you just like us
