[Intro: Smokepurpp]
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Hook: Smokepurpp & Swae Lee]
Big gang, bitch
Nigga what's your type?
Long black hair, hit a bitch from behind
I might spend a bag on that hoe
Throw my cash on that hoe
Dubai bitch
Nigga what's your type?
Yeah I'm in the club throwing money all night
I think I'm in love with a hoe
She in love with the pole

[Verse: Smokepurpp]
Yeah Lil Purpp
Watch how I maneuver
Bitch I'm in the kitchen and I'm whippin' like a scooter
Bad college bitch give me brain like a tutor
Fucked that little hoe and take a flight to Bermuda
And I'm off the lean, choppa stocked with a bean
Yeah shawty go, and she on the pole
She don't like heat but I think she like the scope
Blizzard on my neck, make it snow in the night yeah
And she got a boyfriend but, I don't give 2 fucks
Got the bouncer trippin cuz I came in with like 2 cups
Bad lil bih give me head like Medusa

She in love with the pole
