[Chorus: Roy Woods]
Little bitty shakin' that like maracas
She's rollin' off a bean and I can't stop her
My condo ain't far, you can roll though
Females only at my after-party
Females only at my after-party
Females only at my after-party
Little bitty shakin' that like maracas
She's rollin' off a bean and I can't stop her

[Verse 1: Roy Woods]
2017
16 when I started rappin', now I'm 21 and made
Niggas envy me, 'cause I never changed
Still the same Denzel with the Jheri curls and the fade
Gold chains might bust face if they hit ya
Only way now is up since the boy added Roy to the picture
I'm too busy, can't link ya
I'm fucked up 'cause I'm mixin'
Starboy Roy just entered the building, ya can't miss me
Why your girl wanna kiss me?
Ex girl wanna diss me
That's not real syrup boy, your cup's lookin' too pissy
I ain't gotta change lanes, nigga you know I'm for the century
Still got a few boo thangs back home that I ain't linkin'
On fleek, I'm always on fleek
I look different everyday, get new outfits every week
VIP, VIP status
Females tryna leap at me
You can't love me, you don't understand me
Send me pictures of you without panties
I'ma take 'em off for you, come and find me
Cup on E
My water has M, my blunt has weed
My shawty on go (she on go)
My niggas in the cut, rollin' in the car

[Chorus: Roy Woods]
Little bitty shakin' that like maracas
She's rollin' off a bean and I can't stop her
My condo ain't far, you can roll though
Females only at my after-party
Females only at my after-party
Females only at my after-party
Little bitty shakin' that like maracas
She's rollin' off a bean and I can't stop her

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Only bad bitches invited, yeah
Slide her legs up like a sidekick, ayy, yeah
Leave your cell phones at the door (brr, brr)
Ain't no strippers in this bitch but she ain't got clothes on
Big Boat and my nigga Roy, we important (Lil Boat)
Big group of hoes, but I can only let in a portion, yeah
'Cause some of them hoes ugly (huh)
Them yo' friends
Some of them hoes musty (what)
Don't come again
Don't pop up if you ain't invited
Let you know how yo' bitch feel when I get inside it
And she probably gon' squirt 'cause she gettin' excited
And they probably gon' arrest me for this riot
That they said we incitin'

[Chorus: Roy Woods]
Little bitty shakin' that like maracas
She's rollin' off a bean and I can't stop her
My condo ain't far, you can roll though
Females only at my after-party
Females only at my after-party (females only)
Females only at my after-party (bad tings only)
Little bitty shakin' that like maracas (females only)
She's rollin' off a bean and I can't stop her (bad tings only)

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Niggas lookin' mad, what's your problem?
Bad bitches watchin' me, want a follow
I'm rollin' up some green, avocado
I'm holdin' up my pants and a bottle
Askin' 'bout my grass, no this ain't polo
Young lava boy hotter than a mofo
I took her home and she just hit the lotto
I'm buyin' cars all cash, what's a car note?
She's gulpin' down her drink and she can't swallow
I've got models from Uganda to Toronto (I've got models)
And if you want my bro let my bro know
Green light, if you ain't on go then you stayin' home

[Chorus: Roy Woods]
Little bitty shakin' that like maracas
She's rollin' off a bean and I can't stop her
My condo ain't far, you can roll though
Females only at my after-party
Females only at my after-party (females only)
Females only at my after-party (bad tings only)
Little bitty shakin' that like maracas (females only)
She's rollin' off a bean and I can't stop her (bad tings only)
