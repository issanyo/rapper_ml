Always under water
When the night comes down
I can’t figure it out
Back to going nowhere
Don’t know why you’d want it
Thought that we’d fade out
Sometimes only doubt shows you what you wanted

And when it’s bad
Feels like I don’t know which way I should go
But over time I come back and remember: the one
Thing that I know

Ooh, I know it!
You’re dear to me and I know (x2)
And when you feel like it’s gone away: you’re dear
To me and I know

Always under water
When the day runs out
Still you stayed throughout
Over time I saw it
Not like all the others
They’re a long way down
Back on open ground, hopefully you’re on it

And when it’s bad
Feels like I don’t know which way I should go
But over time I come back and remember: the one
Thing that I know

Ooh, I know it!
You’re dear to me and I know (x2)
And when you feel like it’s gone away: you’re dear
To me and I know
