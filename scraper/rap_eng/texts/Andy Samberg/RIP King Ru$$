[Verse One: Tha Clip]
First off, let me say I ain't really focused
On your diss, got enough beef to feed the homeless
But I'm standing up for me and my other homies
I'm making music, ending you is just a bonus
You're banking on the idea that this'll help you get noticed
But what you didn't know is I'm already ready to blow this
Way out of proportion
Man you talking like you got a fortune
It's unfortunate
You have me as an opponent
All you know how to do is call me gay
It's all you can say
Do you really know me anyway
Do your research
Before you try to diss me first
I know you Russell man, you couldn't be worse
Stop rapping, I don't appreciate your behavior
Stunna dissed you and you replied an hour later
Where's you life at?
Couldn't you do something greater
With your time
Rhymes ain't really working in your favor
Hater
So you can go to sleep nigga
Six feet deep nigga
You probably deep throating for cash on the street nigga
Danger-Ru$$_stan ain't really one of your fans
He's sarcastic, that's something you won't understand
Trauma on your side, you think you got [?]
When he asked for a collaboration from Stunna himself
Get out the game, it ain't beneficial to your health
Danger-Ru$$, you more of a danger to yourself
Nigga

[Verse Two: P-Stunna]
I ain't gonna eat
I ain't gonna sleep
I ain't gonna rest til this nigga kiss my feet
And learn to respect the MC that is me
Russell, me and you ain't even on the same level
You falling further and further below me, say hi to the devil
I dated a Pakistani and Pakyed is not my homie
So get out here with that racism, even though it's corny
I wasn't offended cause I know you can't be serious
You with my girl, dude you must be delirious
The day your bank account reach a single comma
I'll be whiter than a ghost, looking like J Trauma
Talking bout you ball, Like Amar'e
A dude, from my school, my city, man I'm sorry
That you honestly wanna be like me that much
Trynna idolize OTS, man I had a hunch
You really wanna diss the O-Town Spitters
Then shout out Stoudmire, who's an O-Town nigga?
Man I caught you slippin
And red's a nice color for the floor on yo kitchen
Man I gotta charge a extra fee
Cause I also gotta whack your boyfriend XX_E
Little bitch
