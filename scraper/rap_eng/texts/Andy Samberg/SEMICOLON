[Intro: Maya Rudolph and Lonely Island]
Okay everyone
Welcome to grammar class
Today we're learning about semicolons
Oh, oh, oh
Yes, Lonely Island?
We use semicolons everyday
Can you give me an example?
Oh, hell yeah

[Verse 1]
Get ready for a whale of a time: Shamu
My whole team coming clean: shampoo
These dudes is comic relief: Whoopie
And I'm the motherfucking monster: cookie
When you see me better cross the street: Frogger
Then go home and write about it: blogger
"Did I do that?": Urkel
"Yo Angela, Who's The Boss?": Merkel
I'll take you where you've never been: Oxnard
Then make you suck a bulls' nut: ox nard
If Miss Moore married Josh: Demi Brolin
A comma and a fucking dot: semicolon

[Hook: Solange]
We run these streets: stop lights
All eyes on me: spot lights
Each semicolon brings us closer to the top

[Verse 2]
I'm loud and I'm zipping around: jet ski
Your dick is little like Wayne: Gretzky
But Gretsky's got a big dick: clarification
Everyone was rude to me: Paris vacation
My stomach's getting fat: food
Leave trash inside my car: rude
You're acting all Machio: Ralph
But I'll eat all you cats: Alf

[Hook 2: Solange]
We run the game: umpire
Always chase the night: young squire
These semicolons are my light inside the dark

[Verse 3]
It's right under your nose, semicolon: mouth
Opposite of north, semicolon: south
Right over your home, semicolon: attic
Hooked on semicolons, semicolon addict

[Hook 3: Solange]
We got the game on lock: toy chest
You're too big for your clothes: boys vest
You know we out of control: no brakes
Your birthday party sucked: no cakes

[Breakdown: Solange]
When it comes to punctuation
You know we're number one
And to the people of every nation
Feel the power of the semicolon

[Outro: The Lonely Island and Maya Rudolph]
Semicolons
We rest our case
No actually those are examples of colons
You all get F's
Wait, what?
