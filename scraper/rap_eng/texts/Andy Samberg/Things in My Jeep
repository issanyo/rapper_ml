[Intro: The Lonely Island]
KidBrain

[Verse 1: The Lonely Island]
Boxing gloves, condoms and blue blockers
Dress shoes, a Sharpie and 3 quarters
A football, hacky sack, frisbee in the back and a baseball cap
Two folding chairs, adirondack
And a mini cooler filled with healthy snacks
Beach towels, sunblock, a surfboard and a sleeping bag
Bottled water, cashew nuts, extra socks, an American flag
Old boots, paper towels, Shopgirl: A Novella
Deodorant, house keys, sweatshirt, an umbrella
A golf club, basketball, bug spray
A laundry heap, a pocket knife, a battery
These are the things in my Jeep

[Chorus]
These are the things in my Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep (x4)

[Verse 2: The Lonely Island]
Hairspray, a toy car, deck of cards, and some handy wipes
A bag of trash, a shoe lace, a rubiks cube, and a flashlight
A bandanna with my name on it
A mix tape, push play on it
A toothbrush and toothpaste
A tic tac in a briefcase
A dream catcher, a road map
Registration and insurance
A toy car, a rubber band and a tape of the Jimmy Hendrix Experience
A cup holder, a steering wheel, a soda can in the back seat, a phone charger, an old wallet
These are the things in my Jeep

[Verse 3: Linkin Park]
Hi, come inside, look around my Jeep
You will find such marvelous things
A broken stapler, some crumpled paper
Prepare for adventure, inside my Jeep

[Chorus]
These are the things in my Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep
These are the things in my Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep
These are the things, all of the things
These are the things that I keep in my Jeep
These are the things, all of the things
These are the things that I keep in my Jeep
