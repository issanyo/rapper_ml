I was walking through the city streets
And a man walks up to me and hands me the latest energy drink
"Run faster, jump higher"
Man, I'm not gonna let you poison me

I threw it on the ground
You must think I'm a joke
I ain't gonna be part of your system
Man, pump that garbage in another man's veins

I go to my favorite hotdog stand
And the dude says "You come here all the time. Here's one for free."
I said "Man, what'd I look like? A charity case?"

I took it and threw it on the ground
I don't need your hand-outs
I'm an adult
Please, you can't buy me hotdog man

At the Farmer's Market with my so-called girlfriend
She hands me her cell phone says It's my dad
Man, this ain't my dad, this is a cell phone

I threw it on the ground
What you think I'm stupid?
I'm not a part of your system
My dad's not a phone, duh!

Some poser hands me cake at a birthday party
What you want me to do with this? Eat it?

Happy Birthday to the ground
I threw the rest of the cake too
Welcome to the real world jack ass

So many things to throw on the ground
Like this and this and that and even this
I'm an adult

Two hollywood phonies try to give me their autograph
GROUND!
Nobody wants your autograph, phonies

Then the two phonies got up
Turned out they had a taser
And they tase me in the butt hole
Fell to the ground
The phonies didn't let up
Tasin' on my butt hole
Over and over
I was screaming and squirming
My butt hole was on fire
The moral of the story is you can't trust the system
Man!
