[Intro: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, & Both]
Back in that ass, yeah
Your mom says hi, jinx!

[Bridge: Andy Samberg & Justin Timberlake]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
A-y-y-yeah, a-y-y-yeah
A-y-y-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Jam!

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, & Both]
Summertime in the city
And everybody's having sex
You know, I just got a page from a girl
That I met last week at the Payless (ShoeSource)
I also have a cutie to call
Who loves the way I knock on her boots
Well, it's time to mack, let's handle that
In two to six hours, we'll meet back here and regroup
Now, let's shoop
Roll up to the crib with some Bartles and James
Hop off the bus with the Aliz√©
Now hold up, playa, what you diggity-doin' here?
I should diggity-ask you the same
Then she sang

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Andy Samberg & Justin Timberlake]
Hey, boys, I want you both
I hope that you think that's cool (Say word?)
I know most guys won't freak together
But she forgot about the golden rule
Ah-ah-ah!

[Chorus: Andy Samberg & Justin Timberlake]
It's okay when it's in a 3-way
It's not gay when it's in a 3-way
With a honey in the middle, there's some leeway
The area's grey in a 1-2-3-way

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, Andy & Justin, & (All)]
Normally, I don't get down with dudes
But tonight is a special exception (great!)
See, you're my best friend through thick and thin
(Now it's time to make a triple connection)
Lights off!

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, & Andy & Justin]
Here in the dark (here in the dark)
It's hard to tell (so hard to tell)
Where her body ends (la la)
And my homie's begins (ooh-wee)
This rule dates back (the golden rule)
To Ancient Greece (talking about Caesar!)
We're two Jack Trippers and a Chrissy
The new Three's Company!

[Interlude: Lady Gaga]
You guys are still here

[Chorus: Andy Samberg & Justin Timberlake & Lady Gaga]
It's okay when it's in a 3-way
It's not gay when it's in a 3-way
With a honey in the middle there's some leeway
The area's grey in a 1-2-3-way

[Bridge: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, & Lady Gaga]
Fellas, get ready
To impress a chick: helicopter dick, go!
Helicopter dick (uh!), helicopter dick (alright!)
To impress a chick, do the helicopter dick (wow!)

[Chorus: Andy Samberg & Justin Timberlake & Lady Gaga]
And all of that was okay, 'cause it was in a 3-way
It's quite clear when you see the instant replay
"Baby, two is enough," that's what they'll say
But we'll say "Hell no!" 1-2-3 way

[Outro: All & Andy Samberg]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The Golden Rule
