[Intro]
Yeah
It's Hunter

[Verse 1]
Stomping through the forest like a retarded Tyrannosaurus
Hunter eating beefcakes in the back a Ford Taurus
Fuck a chorus, fuck my moms, fuck your dad, fuck this song
Seriously though, fuck this song, I can't stand it man, fuck this song, yo
Campbell's soup, Campbell's soup
And I ride with ya girl, Lake Havasu
And I hula hoop, it's nothing else, butt naked, that's nothing else
I'm young and half dead already
You're old time for Betty bye bye
Say "Hi guy" in a drive-by cause I'm polite
Whole crew full of losers that are all richer than you, sir
And you suck and you suck
How did it get now, you sucked
Oh shit, the king is retarded

[Hook]
One round, head down, eyes up, nose down
Hunter the Hungry is gonna eat (I'm fuckin' hungry)
One round, head down, eyes up, nose down
Hunter the Hungry is gonna eat (Fuck it)

[Verse 2]
Hey yo, I fucked your girl with her baby inside
And then baby had a baby with rabies and didn't survive
Think that's disgusting? Peep this booger I picked
And if you think that's sick, check this wart on my dick
Hey yo, I'm kidding, girl (Or am I?)
Of course I am (That's a lie)
I got a lot of dichotomy and I think I need a lobotomy
Snort more keys than a boss
Steal more ball than a game that's [?]
Blah blah, rap rap rap rap rap
You get it, you get it, everybody gets it
I rap good (Who cares?)
Shaved my balls (Kept the hair)
Knit that shit into a sweater (Motherfucker's itchy as shit)
Fuck around and kill you, my safe deposit got a mil, dude
Yo girl's with me and she's nude which I ignore cause I'm rude

[Hook]
One round, head down, eyes up, nose down
Hunter the Hungry is gonna eat (I'm fuckin' hungry)
One round, head down, eyes up, nose down
Hunter the Hungry is gonna eat
