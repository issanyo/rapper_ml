[Intro: Conner4Real]
Watch out, watch out
It's Conner!

[Chorus 1: Adam Levine & Conner4Real]
I've got it all and I'm gettin' more
But I never fall, beat 'em all
Cause you know I'm so humble (I'm so humble)
I'm so humble (I'm so humble)
I'm a superstar, I kick down the door
Got the money and the girls
And I'm also so humble (I'm so humble)
I'm so humble (I'm so humble, I'm so humble)
I'm so humble (I'm so humble)

[Verse 1: Conner4Real]
Bar none, I am the most humble-est
Number one at the top of the humble list
My apple crumble is by far the most crumble-est
But I act like it tastes bad outta humbleness
The thing about me that's so impressive
Is how infrequently I mention all of my successes
I poo-poo it when girls say that I should model
My belly's full from all the pride I swallow
I'm the most courteous-biddable, hospitable
Reverential, normal-ary Arnold Schwarzen-orgarary
I hate compliments, put 'em in the mortuary
I'm so ordinary that it's truly quite extraordinary

[Break: Adam Levine]
It's not a competition, but I'm winnin'
You won't hear me admit it
Because I'm so timid and submissive
I treat fat people like they were thin
Talk simple for the dumbos
I'm so humble

[Verse 2: Conner4Real]
I'm not your normal definition of a rock star
I don't complain when my private jet is subpar
Ya mom's old, but I'll ask if she's your sister
People say I'm charming, bu-but I beg to differ
I feel more humble than Dikembe Mutombo
After a stumble left him covered in a big pot o' gumbo
I guess in a way, bein' gracious is my weakness
People say I'm so unpretentious for a genius

[Chorus 2: Adam Levine & *Conner4Real*]
I've got it all and I'm gettin' more
But I never fall, beat 'em all
'Cause you know I'm so humble (*I say that with no ego!*)
I'm so humble (*It's just good manners*)
They say I'm a ten, but I'm an eight at best
"Plus two," says you
Not me, cause I'm so humble (*Mama raised me right*)
I'm so humble, I'm so humble

[Outro]
Watch out, watch out
