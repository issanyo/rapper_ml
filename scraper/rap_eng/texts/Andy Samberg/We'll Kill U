[INTRO]
Jorma: Hey
Akiva: Hey. What's wrong?
Jorma: Come quick. Some losers want to fight us
Akiva. Oh. Not again. I'll go get my gun
Jorma: Okay

[HOOK: Jorma & Akiva]
You must be loco to mess with us
Don't you know we're dangerous?
We'll kill you
We'll kill you

[Verse 1: Akiva and Jorma]
It's on now; the fight's beginning
One punch in and we're already winning
Guy number one, the ape-shit killer
After your dead, I drink an ice-cold miller
Out on parole, and I'm looking to score
I'm guy number two, and I'll take your whore
AKs, uzis, nines and Glocks
One pierced ear and ankle socks
If you see us on the street, you can bet we're high
We wear sunglasses, for blood-shot eyes
Each jerk we kill, our hearts grow colder
I could shoot all day; doesn't hurt my shoulder
I drive all the time, it's not big deal
Open the door and get behind the wheel
I only hang with felons, killers, and thugs
You're still a cunt Steve, go fuck your snake

[Hook]
You must be loco to mess with us
Don't you know we're dangerous?
We'll kill you
We'll kill you

[Verse 2: Akiva and Jorma]
Our thirst for blood, is never enough
Is there a heaven, for gangsters like us?
Hey guy number One? Yeah, guy number Two?
I'm just doing me! I'm doing you too (No!)
I only date girls who have been around
I know what they like; I'll go downtown
We play dominoes, but call them bones
And wear cool hats, like Al Capone
Who cares about the pigs; we can pay the bail
You're just a loser; you get raped in jail
We're just two guys, who have a death wish
Screw trial by twelve, we'll be carried by six
Like: Bowm, bowm, bowm bowm bowm bowm-bowm

[Hook]
You must be loco to mess with us
Don't you know we're dangerous?
We'll kill you
We'll kill you

[Outro: Jorma]
Ain't no such thing as half-way crooks
You're scared of death; you're scared to look; your shook
