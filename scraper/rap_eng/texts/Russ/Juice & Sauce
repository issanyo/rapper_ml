[Hook: Russ]
I've been dreaming 'bout
What you been dreaming 'bout
You know that I been, I been
Dreaming 'bout
What you been dreaming 'bout
You know that I been, I been (2x)

[Verse 1: Russ]
We like to dance and stir the pot
I bring the juice she brings the sauce
Were always 10 on 10 on 10 on 10
You make me never wanna' sleep again
When a real one walks thru the door
Better know how to act before the door starts closing
And I go ghost in a ghost
And I hate feeling like I gotta start boasting

[Bridge: Russ]
But baby you been actin kinda strange ever since I walked in
You gotta problem with the truth?
I know you got the sauce
But I got the juice
Baby what it do

[Hook: Russ]
I've been dreaming 'bout
What you been dreaming 'bout
You know that I been, I been
Dreaming 'bout
What you been dreaming 'bout
You know that I been, I been (2x)

[Verse 2: Russ]
I know that you don't wanna' turn up by yourself
You got my number
I know that you don't wanna' turn up by yourself
Call me
Introduce you to yourself
When we talk swear to god its like you looking in the mirror
And i know you know
I'm the mu'fukkin' one

[Bridge: Russ]
But baby you been actin kinda strange ever since I walked in
You gotta problem with the truth?
I know you got the sauce
But I got the juice
Baby what it do

[Hook: Russ]
I've been dreaming 'bout
What you been dreaming 'bout
You know that I been, I been
Dreaming 'bout
What you been dreaming 'bout
You know that I been, I been
