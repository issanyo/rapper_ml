[Verse 1: Russ]
Hey girl, I love what you do to me
Hey girl, this is something new to me
Hey girl, it's feeling like I've known you
Hey girl, I guess I owe you

[Hook: Russ]
You are the wind beneath the love
You are the God in all of us
Cause you make me feel like I can fly
The world is so dark without your light

[Verse 2: Russ]
Hey girl, I love your energy
Hey girl, I love it more than Hennessy
Hey girl, who would of thought
Hey girl, I ever would of loved you
Hey girl

[Hook: Russ]
You are the wind beneath the love
You are the God in all of us
Cause you make me feel like I can fly
The world is so dark without your light
You are the wind beneath the love
You are the God in all of us
Cause you make me feel like I can fly
The world is so dark without your light

[Outro: Russ]
Better ask yourself
If you wanna' know yourself
I promise you, she'll love you
