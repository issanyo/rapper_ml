(Chorus)
I think this might be paradise
I just hope it lasts forever
I think this might be wonderland
I just hope it lasts forever

(Verse 1)
I’ve been tryna beat this clock, Like a bullet from a
Fucking Glock, this is creative binge but yall see it as
Cringe, Assassination, this mic, like it’s confiscated
Like Irving I be swerving round my defenders, Inflicted
Pain gushing outta this brain, Most of these rappers turned to
R&b like fuckboys, Mans be good with this confusion
Setting off every illusion, I pull up in a
Yaris so they treat me like I’m broke, so I flex the
Rollie on em to act up a little more, I’m anxious
I’m nervous when it comes to work, my sup knows that cause she
Asked me work, I make work look sexy, pull up sexy
To work, I use to watch listen and learn, Took all of my
Ls now I'm about to earn, Bitch

(Chorus)
I think this might be paradise
I just hope it lasts forever
I think this might be wonderland
I just hope it lasts forever

(Verse 2)
I wear my construction boots everywhere I go imma
Build something that’s about to blow, they told me boy you gone
Be nothing, so I had to show these motherfuckers that I be
Came something, Harpreets real, Vish is too, Thes, Always On the
Chase, I use to cry myself to sleep cause of my Failures
And dad yelling, my bed be cracking and screeching like a Horror
House, I ain't tryna make it quick, yall a gimmick, I ain't
Tryna start at the top, foundation, Need a be Strong
Some bout the high end features, y’all gone get your ass Murdered
By someone richer, than your dumb, greedy, needy ass
About to expose yall, strip yall naked, I'm a boss, y'all with the fake sauce
Bout to spray off all your moss like a skunk
Yeah
I’m about to unlock this trunk, I’m not afraid
To show you my faults, Like I’m Kanye, so what the fuck are halts? Bitch

(Chorus)
I think this might be paradise
I just hope it lasts forever
I think this might be wonderland
I just hope it lasts forever

(Verse 3)
Can’t be me always some yall don't deserve the real me, I’m
Authentic, special rare fucking breed, I’m the realest like
I’m meek; put my grind to the mill, so took the grain and made
Flour, so now I gotta chill, still talking about the next
Deal, for the show put left to steal, Use to shop at Wal
Mart, now I just bought myself 10 k marts, Designed my own
Mansion, yeah that’s a dream to the blueprint, Like I’m jiggah
I’m hov, fuck a hoe, fuck a gold digger, I’ve been
In the kitchen, ditching all this bitching, while talking
Business sitting code switching, now they think I’m switching
I’ve been reaching, like playing ball, preaching and sweeping
Every shot, Had a yaris, now we in bulletproof cars
Like I’m the fucking president of USA, You
Couldn’t match my resume, the shit I’ve done, the shots
I take you couldn’t pay, that’s till my last day
Bitch

(Chorus)
I think this might be paradise
I just hope it lasts forever
I think this might be wonderland
I just hope it lasts forever
