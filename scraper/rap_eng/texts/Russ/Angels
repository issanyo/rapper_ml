[VERSE 1]
Overcoming anything ya my mind is the strongest
Terrified of that water couldn't swim for the longest
I was 5 when I fell in water
Left me traumatised
How the fuck could I forget that day
I almost died
Went down to the pool
Me my brother and his friends
Shoulda listened to my mom at the crib and stayed in
I was hard headed so my mama always would say
Just know that with that hard head a soft on the way
Didn't care I went down to the pool anyways
With my bro and his crew the whole day and we played water gun fights
Hit me with me them super soakers
He was in the deep end too far I couldn't soak em
Right when he turned his back
Tried to sneak attack and jumped in
Spent the next minute tryna fuckin do my best to swim
I was chokin on myself so much water in my lungs
Couldn't help goin down
Screamin loud when i came up

[HOOK]
God got me covered with some angels
Blessings keep fallin from the heaven up above me
If I keep sharin my blessin from these angels
With the people here on Earth tell me will they love me
God got me covered with some angels
Blessings keep fallin from the heaven up above me
If I keep sharin my blessin from these angels
With the people here on Earth tell me will they love me

[VERSE 2]
I was tryna shoot my own short
Send it right to Cannes
I was tryna do my own stunts like Jackie Chan
Had a whole a crew on set
Spent 7 grand
I was payin straight outta pocket for my C stands
Hell ya we took advantage had a house on a hill
Think about these days I jus start to get to chills
Jumped off a balcony for a video shoot
Landed right besides bricks
Woulda lost every tooth
Woulda probably cracked my head
Blood pourin out my dreads
Was a 12 foot drop
Woulda probably broke my legs
Fair to say I did a fair share of real stupid shit
God musta been watchin whatever that Bugus did
Couple close calls just came way too close
God come thru right when you think you toast
So ya God I really gotta thank you most
Couple close calls just came way too close

[HOOK]
God got me covered with some angels
Blessings keep fallin from the heaven up above me
If I keep sharin my blessin from these angels
With the people here on Earth tell me will they love me
God got me covered with some angels
Blessings keep fallin from the heaven up above me
If I keep sharin my blessin from these angels
With the people here on Earth tell me will they love me


[VERSE 3]
Can you imagine smokin blunts then
Walkin to ya house
20 minutes later cops come walk into ya house
You sit up on the ground while they rippin up ya couch
Got lights in ya eyes tell ya open ya mouth
They straight came thru raided where I record
No respect kickin over my boards
I was thanking my Lord
Wasn't taken for some shit I didn't do
Cuz my nigga when ya black that kinda of shit is typical
They plant drugs on niggas
Plant bugs on on niggas
Broad daylight I seen em land slugs on niggas
I be stayin outta court they drop dubs on niggas
Rather write drop hits and rock clubs on niggas
Played the shit cool shoulda won an Oscar
Knowin for a fact God got me on his roster
No weapon formed against the kid shall prosper
I'm God's kid now watch the kid conquer

[HOOK]
God got me covered with some angels
Blessings keep fallin from the heaven up above me
If I keep sharin my blessin from these angels
With the people here on Earth tell me will they love me
God got me covered with some angels
Blessings keep fallin from the heaven up above me
If I keep sharin my blessin from these angels
With the people here on Earth tell me will they love me
