[Chorus]
Why you fuckin' up so much?
I really don't know
Tell me when enough is enough
Should I leave or should I go?

[Verse 1]
Get your money
I'm not mad at it
I mean I am
But I got a good girl with bad habits
Or maybe just a bad girl with good features
I'll get you outta your nightmare
You fell in love with a dreamer
Who is all up in your speaker
Tellin you that good shit
I'm gonna rev your engine even though you wanted hood shit
I see you got the kush left
But I gave up on us
Like you gave up on your future until I reintroduce hope in it
Never floating in your hotel rooms
You want to blow L's soon
I could make you my wifey but I'm not well groomed
Is this pot well brewed, is it hot enough for it?
I give you the world, is it not enough for you?

[Chorus]
Why you fuckin' up so much?
I really don't know
Tell me when enough is enough
Should I leave or should I go?

[Verse 2]
Prostitutes and dudes who want to fuck make up your circle
You hurt people that love you and love people that hurt you
I'm here lending out my hand asking you to hold on
But you get high with these lowlifes and tell me "Baby hold on"
That's why i've got my coat on, metaphorically speaking
Energy so cold its got me, metaphorically freezing
There's more to me than beats and making thoughts rhyme
I'm a real human being, don't waste my motherfucking time
Cause you probably at the club right now, with some hoes and some dudes that want to fuck that will get you drunk and take you home
Just waiting for you to slip up, until then go split blunts
But the thing about splitting your legs not your blunts
Step your shit up
You're dealing with a different breed
I'm at the top of the animal kingdom
Peek the symptoms of my pedigree
You kick it with the bottom feed
I'm tryna save you
But this rescue mission is draining, first I love you then I hate you
But wait ya its just me talking shit right?
Don't you want to get your shit right?
Oh you do but you're just stubborn?
Ok that's cool then fucking sit tight
And get real, real, real, real comfortable
Cause that will give me a real, real, real reason not to fuck with you
Shall I continue or did you get the message yet?
Smart girl living a dumb life
Just blaming she's intelligent
The fuck?

[Chorus]
Why you fuckin' up so much?
I really don't know
Tell me when enough is enough
Should I leave or should I go?

[Chorus]
Why you fuckin' up so much?
I really don't know
Tell me when enough is enough
Should I leave or should I go?
