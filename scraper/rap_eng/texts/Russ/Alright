[Verse 3]
Yeah, you know my stress stretches ZIP Codes
Tryna go 100 on E, tryna flip lows
Into muses, do what I do's
If deaths comes in threes then pain comes in twoses
Thank you Mom
You're the only thing that keeps me here
I bought depression on the low, but it wasn't cheap this year
I think I reached a tier where everyday I keep a tear
Tucked in the holster like I'm tryna conceal a piece in here
I need peace in here, I'll do whatever
On the road to finding happiness, I'll lose whatever
That's how I'm feelin' as of late, got a lot up on my plate
These are shoes I got exclusive, I don't expect you to relate
Itâ€™s not written on my face, nah, it's buried deep
They see me as strong, so I can't come off very weak
I been havin' scary dreams of death destruction and despair
I guess I'm lost tryna find someone who really cares
Damn, fuck

[Chorus]
And if you reminisce
I hope you find some shit
That helps you benefit and alright
These are crucial times
I wish the pain in me committed suicide and alright (Yeah)

[Outro]
Let my Mom control my will, alright
Leave my friends with all a mill', alright
Tell them all, "It's not your fault," alright
Tell my fans they feel like God, alright
