She got me going Down, Down, Down
Got me living on a tight rope

She got me going Down, Down, Down
She got me going Psycho
She got me going down down dow...

I'm getting carried away
Lets get carried away
Let's get married today, fuck
Here I go again like Whitesnake back in the day
I'm crazy and you crazy too
But I love that shit
You're bad and you're broken too
But I love that shit
Just be open to the possibility of me and you
That's all I ask, I've had the hoes, I've got the cash now I want you
Just be open to the possibility of me and you
That's all I ask, I've had the hoes, I've got the cash


She got me going psycho
She got me going down
Down, down
Got me living on a tightrope
She got me going down
Down, down
She got me going psycho
She got me going down
Down, down
Got me living on a tightrope
She got me going down
Down, down

She got me going psycho
