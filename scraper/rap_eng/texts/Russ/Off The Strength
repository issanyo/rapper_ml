[Intro: Russ]
Mm-mm
Yeah yeah
Yuh yuh

[Hook: Russ]
Lately I've been pulling all these women off the strength
Walk in the club, the DJ got me spinning off the strength
Jumped in the game and lately I've been winning off the strength
Ain't gotta' chase the money, I just make it off the strength
And lately I've been pullin all these women off the strength
Walk in the club, the DJ got me spinning off the strength
Jumped in the game and lately I've been winning off the strength
Ain't gotta' chase the money, I just make it off the strength
What you think

[Verse 1: Russ]
I been on my puffy white linen shit
South Beach, tan, gold chains, life's different
Made a couple million before I turned 24
In less than a year Imma' have twenty more
Mr. Manifest
Built this from the ground up
But never give my hands a rest
Spirit never shakes, it's a mannequin
Off the strength
This feels different
My women different
Man my deals different
Don't compare me
I'm a rare breed

[Hook: Russ]
Lately I've been pulling all these women off the strength
Walk in the club the DJ got me spinning off the strength
Jumped in the game and lately I've been winning off the strength
Ain't gotta' chase the money I just make it off the strength
And lately I've been pullin all these women off the strength
Walk in the club the DJ got me spinning off the strength
Jumped in the game and lately I've been winning off the strength
Ain't gotta' chase the money I just make it off the strength
What you think

[Post-Hook: Russ]
I remember gettin' treated poorly
I remember bitches would ignore me
I was always, always on my own dick
Now they always always tryna' clone this

[Verse 2: Russ]
I leveled up
Just ask my agents
Ask my accountant for the statements
Ask Milan how basements turn to Vegas
Strip, strip, strip, strip
Off the strength
These women naked
Wire transfers got two commas
Momma I made it
Tell Gianna pick it out
Swipe, swipe fuck the price tag
I fly your girl out and then she flys back
Then I resume to robes cigars and ocean balconies
I dropped out and make 50 times my teachers salary
Bachelor without the piece of paper
Just a lotta' funds
I might go to tootsies throw a lotta' ones
You did your best, you did your best
But I felt neither
Off the strength
Imma' get Adele features

Ain't gotta' chase the money I just make it off the strength
