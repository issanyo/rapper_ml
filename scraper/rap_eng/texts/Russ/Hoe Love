[Chorus]
I need that hoe love
I need that hoe love, hoe love, hoe love
Yeah, baby go down for me
I don't wanna ask for it
I know you're a freak
But only be a freak with me
I need that hoe love, hoe love, hoe love
Yeah, baby go down for me

I know you're a freak
But only be a freak with me

I know you wanna be, wanna be
Wanna be my numba one

And you're my drinking partner
Loving partner, fucking partner

Yeah, we ain't gotta front
We know exactly what we want
Let's enjoy the view
And shut the fuck up
You know I hate it when you hesitate
So don't be over thinkin' shit (ay)
You never knew that last night
You pulled up at the last light
I'm about to go left
If you don't get yo fucking act right

I know you're a freak

Yeah, baby go down for me
I don't wanna ask for it
I know you're a freak
But only be a freak with me
