[Hook: Russ]
My baby, my baby
My baby, I got you
My baby, my baby
My baby, I got you

[Verse 1: Russ]
Mmmm
You got a little bit of liquor in your system
Hard headed so you never wanna' listen
Feelin' trapped in your world like a prison
Ain't nowhere to go, dad always go missin'
So you gotta' shack up
With a bitch not on shit
You should back up
But you can't cause there's no other option
How's a flower, in the dark
Suppose to really ever blossom

[Bridge: Russ]
Tryna' tell you I can water your seed girl
Introduce you to the real world
Put you on a plane, get to clackin'
I don't just talk, I make it happen
Eliminate your pride, let me help you
Fuck that shit they tryna' sell you
Catch my wave, come ride with me
Even if it crashes, you're...

[Hook: Russ]
My baby, my baby
My baby, I got you
My baby, my baby
My baby, I got you

[Verse 2: Russ]
Let me talk to you
You workin' three jobs tryna' get a little cash
You think I'm fuckin' with for a little ass
Girl I got groupies by the dozen
I can get 'em when I want
It don't really mean nothin'
I just want all of your lovin'
Yuh
Foreal

Tryna' tell you I can water your seed girl

Fuck that shit they tryna' sell you
Catch my wave, come ride with me
Even if it crashes, you're...
