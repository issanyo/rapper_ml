[Intro: Russ]
Yuh
Imma' always believe and Imma' always keep the faith
But with that being said...

[Hook: Russ]
It's a wild wild world (yeah)
It's a wild world (oo-yeah)

[Verse 1: Russ]
I just hope you realize
The love that I gave you
I stopped when I saw you
You stopped when I saved you
(Oo-ooo)
I just hope you realize
I only broke down
For you to add it up
Take a shot, ash the blunt
(Oo-ooo)
No I can't change up your home plate
That's why a curveball will set you straight
No I can't change up your home plate
Thats why a curveball might set you straight
Thats me

[Hook x2: Russ]
It's a wild wild world (yeah)
It's a wild world (oo-yeah)

[Verse 2: Russ]
We drink like there's a message waiting for us at the bottom
We fantasize all night, just to wake up with some problems
That never disappeared, we never really solved them
Try to bury them beneath, the liquor weed and fucking often (oo-ooo)
The liquor weed and fucking often (oo-ooo)
The liquor weed and fucking often

[Hook x2: Russ]
It's a wild wild world (the liquor weed and fucking often)
It's a wild world (the liquor weed and fucking often)
