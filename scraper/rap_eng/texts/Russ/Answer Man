Damn, I wish I was the answer man
Cuz I got all these questions I can't seem to figure out
So damn
I wish I was the answer man
(Inaudible)

[Verse 1]
Looking off the balcony
Imagine my life in a sea of people
Not even passed my preview but I see my sequel
Living my story everyday just another page
Demonstrating thoughts as I color in this liquor stains
Tryna find a quicker way
Always end up slowmo
Making monopoly everything else is a no go
Yeah I'm so drawn

[Hook]
Damn, I wish I was the answer man
Cuz I got all these questions I can't seem to figure out
So damn
I wish I was the answer man
(Inaudible)

[Verse 2]
Kids wanna grow up
Grown ups wanna be kids
One wants to escape
One wants to relive
But we just sit fast and live slow
Die never whiplash from my instrumentals
Instrumental to the mental game I'm winning never seasonals
Like I just couldn't understand creation is my vehicle
Either way I'm zooming off
Society breathing down my neck
Living in a getaway
Luckily my mind's a champ
Legends in that compact, uptight
Living by some fake rules
Running in a fake race
The finish line is some fake jewels
So go ahead
Live life through competition
All I see is mirrors getting clearer once I got the vision
But still

[Hook]
Damn, I wish I was the answer man
Cuz I got all these questions I can't seem to figure out
So damn
I wish I was the answer man
(Inaudible)
