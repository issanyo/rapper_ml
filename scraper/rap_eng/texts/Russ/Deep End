I fall right back in love with you when I am on the adderall
Then I think the shit you pulled was not so shitty after all
I Only find the time for you when I am on the adderall
Just wanna hear you say my name
Just one more day, just one more call

You say he's just a friend
Girl let's not pretend
Throw me off the deep end
Throw me off the deep end

Say you 100 percent
Never Lie content
Only on the weekend
Only on the weekend

You only say want me when you're lonely on the weekend
Life got you down
Now you're flipping for no reason
The way you walk the way you talk you learned it all from me girl
So why you acting brand new like I didn't give you my world

She never learned how to deal with the pain
Like a Merry-go round
She turn it around
And throw it in my face
The audacity to ask me to stay

Girl you're pushing and driving me crazy
Girl you're pushing and driving me crazy

So when that shit go south
You better watch your mouth

Yaah it's only, on the weekend
Yeah it's only, for the weekend

And I'm sorry, for no reason
Said it's all me, but you tweaking
Yeah it's all Me, and I'm leaving

I fall right back in love with you when I am on the adderall
Then I think the shit you pulled was not so shitty after all
I only find the time for you when I am on the adderall
Just wanna hear you say my name
Just one more day, just one more call

You say he's just a friend
Girl let's not pretend
Throw me off the deep end
Throw me off the deep end

Say you 100 percent
Never Lie content
Only on the weekend
Only on the weekend

Then you said you essentially mine
That we'd be Bonnie and Clyde
That we be Sean and Jhene
Marvin and Chardonnay

I think it's all too late
I think it's all too late
You say you wanna be a friend
But then it's all the same

Corrlinks and jpay
Corrlinks and jpay

I'm just tryna communicate
You got me stuck inside a cell I'm tryna graduate
Iâ€™m tryna graduate

Throwing dirt all over my name
Who said you got consent?
When you done with hurting me
No Temi gon be left

You told me that you love me
I said that I'm loving you too
But then that shit get Ugly
Your words were so far from the truth

That's a known fact
You got me tempted to drop it and fuck it and find where my hoes at
But I know that they don't last
That's why I don't go back, I
Stay put cause I want you, I
Don't care cause I want you
