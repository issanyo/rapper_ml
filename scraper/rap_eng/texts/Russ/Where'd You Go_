From Snippet

[Chorus]
I'm lookin' for the girl I knew before (yeah yeah yeah)
I'm tryna figure out where'd you go
I'm lookin' everywhere, I don't know if you care
I want to know where'd you go
It happened so fast, I wanna go back
I want to know where'd you go
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
I'm out in Lisbon, I'm searchin' for somethin' missing
I know that you feel the void, I'm just sittin' waiting here wishin' like
Jack Johnson, glass [?], you can see I love that
Been a while since fuckin' you on balconies at sunset
