[Hook]
They thought I'd stay down forever
They thought I'd stay down forever
They thought I'd stay down forever
I said, they thought I'd stay down forever
Watch me still do it, even though its twice as hard
Watch me still do it, if I keep my eyes on God
Watch me still do it, even though I'm low on time
Watch me still do it, all I know is go for mine

[Verse 1]
Can't was never in my vocab
Hope was always in my notepad
No advice from my own dad
Till' I had a son and was my own dad
Gotta make good out my own bad
Gotta manifest if I want that
Gotta stand the test don't hold back
Don't fold, yeah I know that (know that)
Paint pictures like Kodak
My uncle said once I had kids that my dream was dead, toe tag
If I keep elevating; next year no telling where my toes at
Old friends popping they nose back, smelling that the flows back
Like he froze that until the day he was ready to go back

[Hook]
Thought I'd stay down forever
But I stayed down forever
I'ma hold it down forever
Till' its going down forever
Ever ever? ever ever ever?
Shit you know I never ever, never ever ever switch
Watch me still do it, even though its twice as hard
Watch me still do it, if I keep my eyes on God
Watch me still do it, even though I'm low on time
Watch me still do it, all I know is go for mine

[Verse 2]
I can't lose if I don't quit
Can't snooze so I won't slip
Paying dues and I'm focused
Making moves I felt hopeless
When I was stagnant on my passion
But I'm back with an everlasting
Grasp on what I had again
No slacking or going back again
Cause I always had the drive
I guess life just threw a lot of traffic in
We just tryna survive sometimes that comes with distractions
Consistency takes practice
Reinvented me through my habits
Just mention me they'll say I had this
Unless they hating on some mad shit
Cause

[Hook]
They thought I'd stay down forever
They thought I'd stay down forever
They thought I'd stay down forever
I said, they thought I'd stay down forever
Watch me still do it, even though its twice as hard
Watch me still do it, if I keep my eyes on God
Watch me still do it, even though I'm low on time
Watch me still do it, all I know is go for mine

[Verse 3]
Feeling like I can't be stopped
It feel like New Years when the beat drop
I'm locked in with my key in the lock
On a cold road, watch me ski to the top
I'm seeing the clock
And I'm in a Golden state feeling like Steph C with the shot
Hold ya plate, I got that food for thought
Yessir I been feeding the block
Like a pick and roll
I chose to gamble like I picked and rolled
My dice and my life following my soul
Nights in this life swallowing them whole
So the only goal is focus on the goal
Most of these hoes be like goalies
They say they bro then act phony
I'm talking bout the homies
So I be on my lonely, except for my real ones only

[Hook]
Thought I'd stay down forever
But I stayed down forever
I'ma hold it down forever
Till' its going down forever
Ever ever? ever ever ever?
Shit you know I never ever, never ever ever switch
Watch me still do it, even though its twice as hard
Watch me still do it, if I keep my eyes on God
Watch me still do it, even though I'm low on time
Watch me still do it, all I know is go for mine
