[Verse 1]
I fell in love with her flaws, is that wrong of me?
I like it when she calls and asks, "Is that song for me?"
Soft lips, hard headed, black boots, is that all for me?
I like the way your tattoos look when they crawl on me
You can fall on me if you get off balance
Swallow your pride, don't swallow some average
Peasant's kids when I could put you in a palace
Maybe not now, but I'm bout to, Alice
Cause we gon' make Wonderland
I can take you to a whole 'nother land
You don't ever have to sell another gram
I'm just hoping that you're not another fan

You're my adrenaline
(You're my adrenaline)
You're my adrenaline
(You're my adrenaline)
You're my adrenaline
(You're my adrenaline)
You're my adrenaline
(You're my adrenaline)

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm going too fast, I didn't want to at first
But the second that I saw you pass, I couldn't press snooze
I had to get my ass to work
Cause I didn't want anyone else on the high that I'm on
Writing the songs that I do, bout you
Bout me, for you
Why me? Why you?
Who knows, I'm cool
If you are too
Cause
