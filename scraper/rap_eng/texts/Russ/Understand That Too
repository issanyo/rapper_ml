[Hook: Russ]
I hear you talking, I'm like "Yeah I understand that too"
You ain't faded, well I'm faded, understand that too
I got the realest ones around me, understand that too
All the people know whats up, they understand that too

[Verse 1: Bugus]
Man your girl hit me up, we gon' plan that too
Fuck em all, tell the cops, understand that too
Gotta flight overseas and we land at two
Crossing borders, Spanish people understand that too
Gotta college graduation, all my fam there too
Worldwide celebration, all my fans there too
Now I made it, now you can't tell me nothing
Fuck talking, I just hear 'em saying something

[Hook: Russ]
I hear you talking, I'm like "Yeah I understand that too"
You ain't faded, well I'm faded, understand that too
I got the realest ones around me, understand that too
All the people know whats up, they understand that too

[Verse 2: Russ]
Cultivating a cult like my last name is Manson
All these chicks that I pull, I should check on my hamstring
I don't fuck with Atlanta, all of y'all sound the same
Call me Young Russ Sherman, set the city to flames
That's why I'm marching like this, that's why I started this shit
That's why I shot this fucking movie, so I could star in this shit
All these groupies are bloopers, all these rappers are losers
Your girl wakes me up with loud, I call that chick a rooster

[Hook x2: Russ]
I hear you talking, I'm like "Yeah I understand that too"
You ain't faded, well I'm faded, understand that too
I got the realest ones around me, understand that too
All the people know whats up, they understand that too

[Refrain x2: Russ]
I've been out wilding with them people on the weekend
I've been out swimming with them sharks in the deep end
I've been living smart by the way I maneuver
Moving state to state everyday, I'mma trooper

[Hook x2: Russ]
I hear you talking, I'm like "Yeah I understand that too"
You ain't faded, well I'm faded, understand that too
I got the realest ones around me, understand that too
All the people know whats up, they understand that too
