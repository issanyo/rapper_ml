Yeah, just like that
Right, Yeah
Yo should I stop or should I just keep going?
Yo Boog
Fuck it

(Yeah) Distractions all around
Tryna fly right by them
That's all the world is
Pussy can have you on an island
Sometimes I'd rather be blinded
Deaf, Dumb and ignorant
Cuz at least at that point
I won't miss what I missin

Sit back cuz this Mazdas coming out
I'm brain dead
Legendary life
White skin but I pay rent
Murderer, I wanna murder her
But I resist
Nice to meet you Lucifer
Who the fuck is Jesus?

Tell the girls that fuck with me
To hit me when they need dick
Otherwise don't bother
I understand your daughter's out here looking for your fathers
And Y'all can call me Papi but it's prolly best if you refrain
Even though I got that Kurt Cobain kinda love
Die for it
Sometimes the truth is too much
I might lie for it
Protection is a blessing until you fuckin wanna ride for it
Haha or ride against it

Now I'm just coming through and fucking up the whole game
Make your move like soul tray
Bring your blues like cold train
Yeah
Diamond
Yeah
