[Hook x2: Russ]
Iiii-I-I-Iiii-I-I-Iiii
Gonna go my own way for now
'Til the sun goes down on me
I'm shootin' up this mutha' fukka'

[Verse 1: Russ]
Yeah, blind faith, that's the compass
For this journey that I'm walkin'
The universe is listenin'
Watch your tone when you're talkin'
Knock, knock, knock, knockin' on the door
But I been knockin' too long
So I ain't knockin' no more
Imma' bust that shit down
Maybe book a lil' tour
Maybe fuck this Puerto Rican
Maybe fly to New York
Maybe talk to these labels
If they offer a lil' more
Maybe spend the cash wisely
Or maybe cop the new Porsche
Maybe blow a couple blunts
Maybe pop a few corks
You either listen to the truth
Or you don't, it's your choice
You either speak the fuck up
Or you don't, it's your voice
You either get lost in the silence
Or get lost in the noise
You either focus on the game
Or get lost in the points
You can focus on the pain
Or turn up and rejoice
Everybody making change
Everybody got a choice
Everybody make a change
That's my mutha' fukkin' choice

[Hook x2: Russ]
Iiii-I-I-Iiii-I-I-Iiii
Gonna go my own for now
'Til the sun goes down on me
I'm shootin' up this mutha' fukka'

[Verse 2: Russ]
Yeah, if I believed in God
I would hit God up
And tell 'em squad up
There's a revolution going on
And you got Russ down here
Top lieutenant
I got a mental list of who flopped
And it's got you in it
I got a treasure chest in my soul
And it's got loot in it
Who's in it? I am
You on the outside
I let my thoughts run
And let my mouth fly
I watch a dawn come
Cause it's about time

[Hook x2: Russ]
Iiii-I-I-Iiii-I-I-Iiii
Gonna go my own for now
'Til the sun goes down on me
I'm shootin' up this mutha' fukka'

[Verse 3: Bugus]
I don't wanna' feel this way that I'm feelin'
I was 17 everything I was killin'
DIEMON was this 2 headed monster
Everything I saw, I conquered
I hit a brick wall things started slowin' up
Russ kicked off, Russ started blowin' up
I'm 22 now, what you wanna' do now
Already, I got somethin' new now

[Hook x2: Russ]
Iiii-I-I-Iiii-I-I-Iiii
Gonna go my own for now
'Til the sun goes down on me
I'm shootin' up this mutha' fukka'
