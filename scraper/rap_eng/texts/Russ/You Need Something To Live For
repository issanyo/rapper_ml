[Hook: Russ]
You need something to live for
Otherwise you gon' waste away
Die less and live more
Otherwise you'll just decay, everyday

[Verse 1: Russ]
Yeah
Another hotel room
Another night to tell some bums, that the hoes fell through
You sellin' bodies to some J's, feelin' LL Cool
You smoke two blunts to take the pain away, that's LL Blues
You the type of girl to do some shit, and
I'm the type of dude to call you out, yeah
You love gettin' hit up by the thirsties
Just so that you can turn them down
So tell me who's thirsty, but first things first
You should love yourself
And know yourself, and know your worth
Figure out your passion, put it into action
But that's not gonna happen by passing ash and blunts
With these average motherfuckers
You gotta change up who you hang with
I could see the anguish on your face from doing the same shit
Everyday, and it's a shame that you don't listen
But if you wanna get out, of your position

[Hook: Russ]
You need something to live for
Otherwise you gon' waste away
Die less and live more
Otherwise you'll just decay, everyday

[Verse 2: Russ]
Guess who?!
Stuck in the cycle
Sick of society, so unlike you
I know you know those type of people
Always askin' what the move is, and when they finally move
They don't even make a movement
Neutral living, same dudes hitting you up, tryna fuck
Or go to the club, and you listen
'Cause you hate being alone, dang
You hate being alone

[Hook: Russ]
You need something to live for
Otherwise you gon' waste away
Die less and live more
Otherwise you'll just decay, everyday
