[Verse 1]
I put myself on so that's who I get the paper with
I been on my owner, coach, fan and player shit
Draped in my own clothes
Fam' needs money, so I try to split up bands like I'm trying to go solo
Got to keep a low profile when I'm home
It's cool to make the hoes go wild, but I know
That's how you get jammed up
So please, put your right hand up
And swear to me that even when you're blitzed you'll keep the cam tucked
On your Carolina shit
She popping pussy like it's Vicodin
And I just want to try this shit
This is that, "Build a fan base without a shortcut"
Turn my Nissan into a tour bus
This is by me, for us
Put my family on my back, rock that shit like it's a jersey
Doing circles 'round the game until I'm dizzy and I'm blurry
High school classmates thought this path was a tragedy
In one night I make their two month salary

[Hook x2]
'Kay, this money that I'm making
Yeah, it's new to me
All these women getting naked
Yeah, that's new to me
I'm the topic of conversation
That's new to me
People ain't believe, I always did
That's nothing new to me

[Verse 2]
Listening to Wayne to cure my writer's block
I been taking flights a lot
Top notch accountant, he gon' make sure that we write it off
All I ever wanted was a platform
Get Gianna and my mom anything that they ask for
Saying I should rap more, saying I should sing less
Saying I should sing more, saying I should spit less
I couldn't give a fuck 'bout what you think
You were nowhere to be seen
When I was doing what I knew would put my family on they feet
I ain't walking through the game, bitch I'm levitating
Bitch I drop bombs, there's no telling when I'm detonating
Coming from a meeting with people that control your favorite artist
Money making up their mind, their bank account is where their heart is
So, we don't get along, 'cause my heart is where my art is
Even if you blackball me, it's still fuck you, regardless
Groupies multiplying, leeches multiplying
Labels trying to figure out (What?) the secret I've been hiding

[Hook x2]
'Kay, this money that I'm making
Yeah, it's new to me
All these women getting naked
Yeah, that's new to me
I'm the topic of conversation
That's new to me
People ain't believe, I always did
That's nothing new to me
