[Hook x2: Russ]
When I roll up
I ain't gotta say too much I'm good (I'm good)
When I roll up
Better act the way you fuckin should (You should)

[Verse 1: Russ]
If only you could see me now
You would wanna press rewind
Everybody is a star
Some just don't know how to shine
I've been DIY forreal
I've been making myself hot
Women throw themselves at me
All your girlfriends getting caught
I just take it as it comes
Gettin bigger by the day
I just focus on the signs
You should probably do the same
Ain't no telling when I'm popping
But I know it's coming soon
You can feel it in the air
When I step into the room

[Hook x2: Russ]
When I roll up
I ain't gotta say too much I'm good (I'm good)
When I roll up
Better act the way you fuckin should (You should)

[Verse 2: Russ]
I've been wrapped up in myself
I've been living like a mummy
Self belief unlocked the door
On the other side is money
I believed and got it crackin
I ain't need to see it happen
Making something outta nothing
You could say I'm doing magic
I might lose myself in this
But I'll always be a winner
Feeling stronger than this Gin
This is something for your liver
Confidence mixed with ambition
Everything will fall in place
What I think about I bring about
I never have to chase

[Hook x2: Russ]
When I roll up
I ain't gotta say too much I'm good (I'm good)
When I roll up
Better act the way you fuckin should (You should)
