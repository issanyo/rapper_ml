[Hook]
She got me going psycho
She got me going down
Down, down
Got me living on a tightrope
She got me going down
Down, down
She got me going psycho
She got me going down
Down, down
Got me living on a tightrope
She got me going down
Down, down

[Verse 1]
Oh no, you lie
I want to, so I
Might call you tonight if I do pick up
I got some Gin in me
A hundred bands on me
I'm feelin' myself, yeah
I might say too much

[Hook]
She got me going psycho
She got me going down
Down, down
Got me living on a tightrope
She got me going down
Down, down
She got me going psycho
She got me going down
Down, down
Got me living on a tightrope
She got me going down
Down, down

[Verse 2]
I don't know you but I know that you special
Fuck a verse, fuck a hook I'll use the whole instrumental
Just to reiterate the commitment I have to explore
Like would you ride it like a horse like my last name is Lauren
I'm only interested
Baby I'm infatuated
You been held back I'll get you to graduation
Help you with your cash
Steer you clear of tax evasion
Death grip on your ass
I call that assassination
I'm getting carried away
Let's get married today, fuck
Here I go again like Whitesnake back in the day
I'm crazy and you crazy too
But I love that shit
You're bad and you're broken too
But I love that shit
Just be open to the possibility of me and you
That's all I ask, I've had the hoes, I've got the cash now I want you
Just be open to the possibility of me and you
That's all I ask, I've had the hoes, I've got the cash

[Hook]
She got me going psycho
She got me going down
Down, down
Got me living on a tightrope
She got me going down
Down, down
She got me going psycho
She got me going down
Down, down
Got me living on a tightrope
She got me going down
Down, down

[Outro]
She got me going psycho
