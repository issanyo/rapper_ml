[Chorus]
These images haunt me
I'm tryna run away
And now they're tryna taunt me
I'm tryna run away

[Verse 1]
Drop-top got hot in my mind
You see stop, I see a sign
Livin' the life for the chase of emotions
You waiting in line, I'm just taping the motion
I'm lacing my potion with faith and devotion
You making a wave, I'm making an ocean
I'm giving my soul, taking a toll of who's real and who's not and who's chasing the goal

[Chorus]
These images haunt me
I'm tryna run away
And now they're tryna taunt me
I'm tryna run away

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I see the camera, Russ
I see all the flashes as I'm driving round Atlanta
See the future through my glasses
I look down at my steering wheel
Double R's its feeling real
Louie shades, whole crew is paid
We smoking j's, you know the deal
But I'm currently on my way there
Asking God if I play fair
Is it possible for these obstacles to be gone by the time I have grey hair (grey hair)
Just say yeah
I'm about to be worldwide 'cause my beats bounce
This deep south
So you know I keep my purp fried
Search high and I search low
Tryna find a way to make the earth flow to
My circle means business
Urkles keep your distance
Cuz its top secret
Stop peeking
This ain't for you bitches
This is all inside my mind
In due time I will get my wishes

[Chorus]
These images haunt me
I'm tryna run away
And now they're tryna taunt me
I'm tryna run away

[Verse 3 - John Anthony]
And they say Johny get your work on
7 hours deep at 10 a.m. shirt on
She perfect with them birks on
From here on, to so long
Boy John don't I lift her emotions up like Vultron
She skirt off I work hard
Zone 3 my graveyard, lanyard
Hanging around my neck my finger itchin around this check
Boy I'm feelin make a million on respect like
Nigga I'm feelin' make a killing on these deaths to whats left
But 8 fingers and 2 thumbs strangle money with no one
[?]
Told my mamma I was gonna be famous when I grow up
And now a nigga grew up, but I blew up
[?]

[Chorus]
These images haunt me
I'm tryna run away
And now they're tryna taunt me
I'm tryna run away

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
These images haunt me
I'm tryna run away
And now they're tryna taunt me
I'm tryna run away
