[Chorus]
Go where I want when I want
I think I'ma go west
And I'ma see Arizona
I been in Georgia
Sun is shining in Florida
I'm a free bird
Smokin' on California in Indiana

[Verse 1]
Gotta move tryna boom out in Jupiter
Stand still now ya closer to Lucifer
Got a Colt 45, tryna loosen up
Got a buzz online, tryna boost it up
Got a Dad and a Mom, tryna make 'em proud
Got a bag and a bong, tryna bake a pound
I'm up my anti touch my Grammy
Go with my family down to Miami
No they can't control my visa
My world i roam like Caesar
My song my girl my diva
Good drink ma good sativa
God knows in far from lousy
Lord knows I'm smokin' loudly
Hotbox I'm ridin' cloudy
Eyes drop like Ronda Rousey

[Chorus]
Go where I want when I want
I think I'ma go west
And I'ma see Arizona
I been in Georgia
Sun is shining in Florida
I'm a free bird
Smokin' on California in Indiana
Go where I want when I want
I think I'ma go west
And I'ma see Arizona
I been in Georgia
Sun is shining in Florida
I'm a free bird
Smokin' on California in Indiana

[Verse 2]
To so hard ain't neva been lazy
Imma use the two legs that God gave me
Go so long bitch I'm Tom Brady
I go Kobe, drop 'bout 80
Then I roll out in a drop top baby
285 I do about 80
Push it to the limit
When I get in it
I don't get high til my 3rd blunt finished
When I can't deal with the weight and the pain of the world
I write my pain and I sang for the world
Came from afar ain't came for the fame
But i came for the change I can brang to the world
When I can't deal with the weight of the world
I write my pain I sang for the world
Came from afar ain't came for the fame
But I came for the change I can brang to the world

[Chorus]
Go where I want when I want
I think I'ma go west
And I'ma see Arizona
I been in Georgia
Sun is shining in Florida
I'm a free bird
Smokin' on California in Indiana
Go where I want when I want
I think I'ma go west
And I'ma see Arizona
I been in Georgia
Sun is shining in Florida
I'm a free bird
Smokin' on California in Indiana
