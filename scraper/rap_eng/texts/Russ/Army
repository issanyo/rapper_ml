[Verse]
Who's this dude who's rappin' crazy?
Makin' beats and singin' too
Labels sendin' invites to the man
Betta bring the loot
Mama told me act polite
Act like that you've seen some money
My dad taught me watch them eyes
Bitches out here actin' funny
You live like you grabbed the money
I live like I have the money
I'ma put my family on
Get my shit and pass the money
Buy my mom an island
It's Tuesday, we're in Bora Bora
Drop some shit out for the fans
Continue on my dora-dora
Pass the gin', I poura-poura
Lables need some more-a more-a
Cause a couple ends ain't gonna make me move up out my corner
Fuckin' up yo country
USA girls treat me like I'm foreign
Givin' out this free food
Hope that you enjoyed your portion
My shit's for the masses
You rappin' for yo neighborhood
Got some money in my mattress
That could fuck up yo whole neighborhood
Deep breaths for the shallow minds
I said deep breaths for the shallow minds
Ignite your fire, we could all shine

[Chorus]
I got two middle fingers up if you don't care for me
I got to be there for my fans 'cause they was there for me
Left, Right, Left, come and march for me
Got a fuckin' army round the world on call for me
I got two middle fingers up if you don't care for me
I got to be there for my fans 'cause they was there for me
Left, Right, Left, come and march for me
Got a fuckin' army round the world on call for me

[Verse]
Guns up to the cashier
'Cause it's cash here (yeah)
I was polishin' my shit
That was last year (yeah)
Now I'm smoother than a criminal
And I'm movin' like a general
Fuck that shit that all of y'all are talkin' bout
I'm makin' myself hot
Ain't shit y'all can tell me
This is like 50 mixed with Em
Mixed with Machiavelli
Got the tele in New York
Labels tuggin' on my arms
Sicily in my blood, I'm a boss
They recognize the Don
Gettin' on while you foulin' up
But it's never really been about you
Cause mothafuckas been makin' moves
With or without you
And I'm smoother than a criminal
And I'm movin' like a general

[Chorus]
I got two middle fingers up if you don't care for me
I got to be there for my fans 'cause they was there for me
Left, Right, Left, come and march for me
Got a fuckin' army round the world on call for me
I got two middle fingers up if you don't care for me
I got to be there for my fans 'cause they was there for me
Left, Right, Left, come and march for me
Got a fuckin' army round the world on call for me
