[Hook x2: Russ]
If I died would you feel like crying
If I died would you feel like dying
If I died would you feel like living
If I died would you feel like trying
I'm optimistic

[Verse 1: Russ]
Now if I died would you mourn for me
I know if my mom and dads son got
Sent in the ground they would storm for me
If I was murdered Bugus turns to Jason Bourne for me
Fuck the money, who's lightin' up a ford for me
Explore honeys 'til I find my queen, now I'm buzzin'
I just hope that when I got out
It's what it is, not what it wasn't
Fuck the cousins imma' gain
From the millions I attain
Imma' change the fuckin' would for the better
Scream my name

[Hook x2: Russ]
If I died would you feel like crying
If I died would you feel like dying
If I died would you feel like living
If I died would you feel like trying
I'm optimistic

[Verse 2: Bugus]
If I die my momma gon' be sad
But I know that I'm a legend
Off these mutha' fukkin' raps
Spent so much time
And I can't get it back
So I better get something
Off these mutha' fukkin' raps
But to everybody staying
Imma' leave behind
Don't be fucking up my legacy
Don't waste my fucking time
If you know what I'm 'bout
Let me see it your steps
I bet my uncle won it
As he took his last breath like

[Hook x2: Russ]
If I died would you feel like crying
If I died would you feel like dying
If I died would you feel like living
If I died would you feel like trying
I'm optimistic

[Verse 3: Russ]
From Belgium to Australia
America to Germany
My desire's to inspire
Anybodys who's ever heard of me
My momma taught me reciprocate the love
That's just curtesy
Hope you treat your life like it's an emergency
With a since of urgency

[Hook x2: Russ]
If I died would you feel like crying
If I died would you feel like dying
If I died would you feel like living
If I died would you feel like trying
I'm optimistic

[Outro: Russ]
Yeah
Clocks tickin
Stop wishin'
Start movin'
Start a mutha' fukkin' movement
Start doing something
