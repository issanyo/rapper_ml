[Hook: Russ]
I can't lie, Imma' get high tonight
I can't lie, Imma' get loose
Because I know someone died tonight
But I'm alive, this my proof

[Verse 1: Russ]
Life is getting pretty crazy, I can't lie
Everything is starting to multiply
From the fans to the girls
To the self-expectations
From the money, but it's funny
My soul feels amazin'
Dropped a couple thousand like it ain't nothing
And it's funny cause that money really ain't nothing
But a smile on my mom's face, smile on Gianna's face
And I know the world is hungry but I got in my place

[Hook: Russ]
I can't lie, Imma' get high tonight
I can't lie, Imma' get loose
Because I know someone died tonight
But I'm alive, this my proof

[Verse 2: Russ]
Yeah, think about you, hope that you different
I got tattoos, I'm not scared of commitment
I'm just listening to the universe, hoping I'm not missin'
'Cause sometimes thoughts are so loud I don't hear what it's whisperin'
And the cops rolled up and I'm on probation
And I don't really need that va-ca-ca-ca-ca-cation

[Hook x2: Russ]
I can't lie, Imma' get high tonight
I can't lie, Imma' get loose
Because I know someone died tonight
But I'm alive, this my proof
