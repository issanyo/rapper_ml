[Intro]
I feel it in my veins right now
My brain right now
I just need the money and the fame right now
(Fuck what you talkin' 'bout, fuck what you talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout)
Yo
(Fuck what you talkin' 'bout)
Yo

[Verse 1]
See I go hard as fuck
Call me God or call me Russ
I'm your highness
You can't find us
Anywhere else
So cough it up
Cause I'm losing my mind
Just to enter into you mind
So you better be there on time
Yea you better be there on time
Yeah
So fuck your life
And fuck your sister
Mamma's missing
I've been up all night
Just trying to find Jesus
In this Vodka
One more shot
I'm going what I'm after

[Chorus]
I feel it in my veins right now
My brain right now
I just need the money and the fame right now
(Fuck what you talkin' 'bout, fuck what you talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, fuck what you talkin' 'bout)
I feel it in my veins right now
My brain right now
I just need the money and the fame right now
(Fuck what you talkin' 'bout, fuck what you talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, fuck what you talkin' 'bout)

[Verse 2]
I know I shut it down
When it's eyes on me
I know I fuck around
And I'm a you gonna see
We gon be the real mother fuckers in the world
To do it
To do it
Yea-e-eah
Oh
I gave my mind
I gave my time
What was it all for
So we can finally cross that line
Only to want more
Maybe the chase
Is better than the taste
But I can tell you already
We're gonna make this great

[Chorus]
I feel it in my veins right now
My brain right now
I just need the money and the fame right now
(Fuck what you talkin' 'bout, fuck what you talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, fuck what you talkin' 'bout)
I feel it in my veins right now
My brain right now
I just need the money and the fame right now
(Fuck what you talkin' 'bout, fuck what you talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, fuck what you talkin' 'bout)

[Verse 3]
Hell I marry, full of grace
And standing at the start
With a heart this full of faith
And I got them full of snakes
I gotta battle with these apples everyday
I'm facing temptation to get at them
I couldn't handle
And I'm hoping I could spark a mind
They say the truth is hard to find
I told the truth
I guess that's when I crossed the line
This paper that I'm rolling
Got me feeling close to bible
The snitches that I'm smoking
Got me feeling close to God

[Chorus]
I feel it in my veins right now
My brain right now
I just need the money and the fame right now
(Fuck what you talkin' 'bout, fuck what you talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, fuck what you talkin' 'bout)
I feel it in my veins right now
My brain right now
I just need the money and the fame right now
(Fuck what you talkin' 'bout, fuck what you talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, fuck what you talkin' 'bout)
