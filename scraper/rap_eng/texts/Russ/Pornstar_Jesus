I swear I need a pornstar
I'mma make it easy, we can get sleazy
Cause you don't make me work hard
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus whoa

[Russ & Bugus]
For the redbone, for the hater
Where me come from street hot like Jamaica
Can't break us unbreakable
Ohhh I'm looking for an accent
We can get illegal like whoo whoo
Let them pull us over, we're not sober, gone off the goose
It don't even matter that it's a factor
We're just gettin lose
Let me see if you do what I want to

I swear I need a pornstar
I'mma make it easy, we can get sleazy
Cause you don't make me work hard
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus whoa

[Russ & Bugus]
She got tats on her stomach, earring, tounge ring, belly ring
Real goon and I love it
First glance I knew it in a second
I know if I fuck her it's gonna probably be a lesson
At least another one under the influence
Gettin that event, while she's getting into it
Intuitively we need to be back seat
Ass up till that ass sleep

[Hook x2]
I swear I need a pornstar
I'ma make it easy, we can get sleazy
Cause you don't make me work hard
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus whoa
