[Verse 1: Russ]
Ok, laid back contemplating chess moves
Life heating up I just need someone to vent to
Cup full of stress so I'm sippin' like the rents due
Dialing the number for my visions hope I get through
Ten two seaters in the driveway
Chains on everybody
Welcome to the ice age
Murdering the moment makes me money
I guess crime pays
You probably have to leave your state
To change your mind state
Blind dates with my journey
Everyday I wake up
Runnin through these hoes
Never tripping keep it laced up
Cause all of them got cardboard signs
Saying save us
But after the last one
I chose to hang the cape up
Focused on myself
Ain't no time for distractions
Sometimes I can't believe it all
Like how'd the hell this happen
Gotta' keep it moving though
Ain't no time to look around
Jab you with the raps
Then knock you out when I bring the hook around
Now bring the hook around

[Hook: Russ]
Everybody here I am
Everybody here I am
Tanqueray cups got me woozy
Posted up lookin for some floozies
Devils get up off me like Boosie
Imma' always keep my first hoopty

[Verse 2: Russ]
Imma' pro juggler
Lately my life's a circus
I spent about 10k on purses
And every cent was worth it
Once I saw her eyes light up
It's me myself and I
Who the fuck wanna' fight us
Dreams overlapping now
Lines keep blurring
Drunk off my accomplishments
I keep slurring
And nowadays my contact list
Is stocked with enough weapons
That I'm pointing at the game
Like bomb that shit
Saddam that shit
And bring me back the loot
Hit the dealership
Go head and bring me back a coupe
I ain't got no time to hang
These hoes are looking like a noose
And I ain't got no time for exes, let alone an excuse

[Hook: Russ]
Everybody here I am
Everybody here I am
Tanqueray cups got me woozy
Posted up lookin for some floozies
Devils get up off me like Boosie
Imma' always keep my first hoopty

[Outro x2: Russ]
Hold up, I don't hear you talkin' when I roll up
Where's that shit you poppin' when I roll up
