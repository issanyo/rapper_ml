[Verse]
I swear this happens every single time
I fall for gorgeous faces just like yours
I'm blastin' my way into your heart, girl
And I know it'll be worth it
In due time
You'll see that

[Hook]
This isn't
No half-ass fuck shit
Bear with me now
No need to rush this
I  don't wanna say come and go
Ah, ah
I  don't wanna say come and go
Ah, ah
Girl this isn't
No half ass fuck shit
Bear with me now
No need to rush this
I  don't wanna say come and go
Ah, ah
I don't wanna say come and go
Ah, ah

Whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah
