[HOOK]

I smell bullshit
Don't know what to call it
Other than bullshit
Blows my mind
Blows my high

[VERSE 1]

Turn on the TV
All I see is commercial
Every day I pray my CD is commercial
Every rapper just wanna sign to Universal
I'd rather be online straight universal
Didn't fit in with the system
But I swallowed it and got that shit up out my system
And I know these people get greedier
News stay feeding y'all bullshit
Truth gets lost in the media

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2]

If I see another girl post another pic for some validation
God Imma fucking go crazy
If I see another dude flexing on the gram acting like he the man
I'll be fucking your lady
Lately I see insecurities
The government isn't built for minorities
I see ghettos all around the White House
So many empty rooms with the lights out

[HOOK]
