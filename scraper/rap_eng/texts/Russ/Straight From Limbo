[Verse 1: Russ]
I'm coming straight from limbo
I don't know what day it is
Blunt in my mouth Johnny Walker
Thats the way it is
Motherfuck an alias I just go by Russ
Riding thru the city with mistakes in my trunk
I displaced all my luck a long time ago
Now its just skill
Minds on Pluto hands on the wheel
Damn right Russ is crazy
I'll take it as a compliment
Met a little lady she kept tellin me that I'm the shit
I call it braggadocios someone grab the roaches
Take a shot with Jesus then I passed the blunt to Moses
Like Oh My God I'm high
Fuckin devils in disguise
Tan skin round thighs brown eyes round five
Different reasons why I shouldn't even do it
But we're drinkin bombay bumpin all my music
Movin like Beyonce she sharp with every movement
But I'm feelin like I'm Kanye
So I start to lose it can you blame me?
How about we blame it on the game
Cuz this ain't me, maybe I'm a psycho
Learning how to juggle all the voices in my head
Feelin dead as I hydro ... plane
Crossing into other lanes
And the lights go ... off behind me
Remind me what I been doin
Fuck the cops I'm drunk as hell
I'm innocent til proven
That I'm guilty thinkin will they smell the liquor
Will they smell the kush
I know I just smoked a swisher
So I know I'm lookin suspect
You gonna have to prove it tho
Scotch on the rocks tell the cops
Thats the usual devils' lookin beautiful
Dancing in those high heels
Living in a crucible
Wonderin if lifes' real
Coming straight from limbo

[Hook: Russ]
They say I'm crazy and I don't know why
No I don't know why
Yeah
Its lookin hazy so I close my eyes
Yeah I close my eyes
Cuz I'm from Limbo Limbo
And I'm muthafuckin mental mental
And you can't fuck with me
No you can't fuck with me

[Verse 2: Bugus]
Uh
You better let me in
Better let me grin
Bugus in this bitch got the devil in my gin
I'm never gonna lose
I'll abuse for my wins
I've paid all my dues
And I've prayed for my sins
I've saved all my dudes
I choose to intrude
I coulda came cool
But I choose to be rude
Uh, If my food ain't ready Machetes are comin at ya
White widow weed, no seed, we call it Casper
Ball all night, practice all day
Running to a day suicide both ways
I'm such a survivor, such a carnivore
Fuck your thoughts bitch, suck your saliva
Straight from limbo, straight from a Lambo
Got alot a space in my safe so I gamble
Got alot of faith in my chase so I can't fold
Got alot of paint for my face, mo ammo
Came in the camo, feeling like Rambo
Diamonds, holla, then your whole camp gets trampled
Just for showing up, diamond stay glowing up
Bugus put it down, Motherfucker ya you know wassaup

[Verse 3: Russ]
Ya you know its us, motherfucking mon-stars
Bugus and Russ blowing blunts in a cop car
Motherfuck your handcuffs, you know that we stand tough
Coming for your head, what a rap game.. stand off!

[Verse 4: Bugus]
I see you won't leave us alone until a nigga goes crazy
Ridin' through the slums, trunk full of drunk babes
Mercedes was stolen, a couple of ladies were chosen
Would've thought we were the mob by the way we was rollin'

[Verse 5: Russ & Bugus]
Oh you think we the mob?
I think we the mob
In my head I get head and these hoes call me god
Word, they call you god? Well I guess i play satan
Back to killin Katy Perry in my basement
Wait, have patience
Nah, fuck patience!
I wanna see this bitch's blood wasted
Nah you don't need to you really don't have to
I don't give a fuck she's chopped up in my bathroom!
Shut the fuck up Bugus, who the fuck asked you?
Shut the fuck up?
Don't let one kill gas you, you don't kill for the villain
Cause one will catch you and will leave you on the mat and I don't mean Matthew
Fuck him, fuck you, and fuck the whole world!
Cause while I'm rappin this I'm probably fuckin yo girl!
Excuse my friend I tell him time and time again
But he knows no better let the story begin
Straight from Limbo
