[Hook: Russ]
Baby girl
I see myself with you
Baby girl
You make me feel brand new

[Verse 1: Russ]
And when the lights go down
And that liquor pours up
And less is no
That the truth comes out
And you can't control your anger
With your Colombian mouth

[Hook: Russ]
Baby girl
I see myself with you
Baby girl
You make me feel brand new

[Verse 2: Russ]
I'll follow you into the dark
And I'll ride your wave
Until it crashes on me
Drunk off you
And high off floatin'
In this Dead Sea

[Hook: Russ]
Baby girl (baby girl I'm sayin')
I see myself with you
Baby girl (baby girl I'm hangin' or)
You make me feel brand new

[Outro: Russ]
Baby, tell me are you down
For the realist mutha' fukka' alive
For the realist mutha' fukka' alive
For the realist mutha' fukka' alive
