[Verse 1]
Crazy ass flow, damn I'm a monster
Million from a beat, that's the feed it will cost ya
I'm that guy, I dont need the credits to prove it
I'm getting ahead of my music, you up for green but you blew us all
Maybe cause you knew us so you got past
It's for the green, only speed and my shots fast
I got a shot glass filled with the finest
The world added me and your bumbs got minus
Now I'm bout to climb this ladder to the stars
Henny bottle straight to the neck like scars
I stepped on Mars, so earth goes noway
I put blumbs up and watch the world rotate
And back in OE, me and bugies used to kick it
Maybe for the studio, we where shitting on your bitches
On the highschool team, have a highschool dreams
Never follow sue but the clues on screen, motherfuckers
Damn

[Verse 2]
I celebrate life, everytime I wake up
Thank god, I can breath and I ain't copped
You need to shape up, yeah at the line with your attitude
Go and hit the bank up, and get a sence of grattitude
I'm mad at you but glad at you and not me
I went and bought a couple diamonds at the swat me
Guess what it cost me, about an hour
Just because its stores doesnt mean it ain't a flower
Basically I'm saying that, half a mankind
Tries to be the judge but ain't trying do the time
I'm just tryna rime, only over my shit
Cause in my mind theres a fullblown marspit
Guess I gotta watch it, and record my observations
Ride it with the flow and then show the population
You lost your paychess, cause ain't a shit hot
I think it's time for operational hip pop
