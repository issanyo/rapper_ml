[Chorus]
We talkin' less & less
Keep it groovin', keep it movin'
You my ex
We are over, time to see what's poppin' next
Cause there's nothing to say
Karma's coming your way
I got nothing to say, but
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
I don't be in the club like that
What goes around always come right back
In too deep with a love like that
Plus I'll never the get the time that I spent right back
Crossed me too, I thought you the one
Crossed the moon, I brought you the sun
When I was down, couldn't help me up
No matter what I do, it'll never be enough
Life done got a lot easier
You trippin' so I had to peace to ya
It's gon be awhile before I speak to ya
So expect no calls I ain't reachin ya
You got problems, you got issues
I still got love for you, I don't diss you
But you been feedin' a lotta demons
And that's the main reason

[Chorus]
We talkin' less & less
Keep it groovin', keep it movin'
You my ex
We are over, time to see what's poppin' next
Cause there's nothing to say
Karma's coming your way
I got nothing to say, but
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 2]
Had good head 'til you went and bumped it
I still turn nothin' into somethin'
I kill stages still get it jumpin'
Think about you only once in a month and
You can't seduce me and then reduce me
I met you, you ain't never introduce me to this new chick
That's a whole different person
Whole different song with a whole different verse
Swear the whole mood change up
When she's brought up
Hope this night club don't get shot up
Cranberry juice mix it up with vodka
Cigars with ganja we gon all get proper
For my dogs in bondage locked up like rastas
We gon all be on do it all big poppa
Ain't on what I'm on get left
Now we talkin' less & less

[Chorus]
We talkin' less & less
Keep it groovin', keep it movin'
You my ex
We are over, time to see what's poppin' next
Cause there's nothing to say
Karma's coming your way
I got nothing to say, but
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Bridge]
What goes around is comin' right back around [x4]

[Verse 3]
Stressed no blessed yes
Livin' my life to the best yes
Let go excess
Girl I gotta move on on to the next
[x2]

[Chorus]
We talkin' less & less
Keep it groovin', keep it movin'
You my ex
We are over, time to see what's poppin' next
Cause there's nothing to say
Karma's coming your way
I got nothing to say, but
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Bridge]
What goes around is comin' right back around [x4]
