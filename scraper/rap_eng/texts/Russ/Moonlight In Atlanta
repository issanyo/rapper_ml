[Intro]
I just wanna...
Let you know...
Baby let your hair down

[Chorus]
You're feeling like a smooth ride
Bottle of gin makes the mood right
Babygirl you're looking like the
Moonlight in Atlanta
You're feeling like a smooth ride
Bottle of gin makes the mood right
Babygirl you're looking like the
Moonlight in Atlanta

[Verse 1]
Okay, I'm rolling round the city
Hoping that the cops don't get me
Got this boricua on my right hand side, right hand side
Yeah, I tell her that I love her
Even though I really don't mean it
I'm sorry that I do you so cold sometimes

[Interlude]
She said "I know you get lonely too"
I looked at her and said "then you know what to do"

[Verse 2]
I tell her bring the freak out
She's a step ahead she's on her knees now
Howling at the moon till the sun comes up
And now im getting lost in time
I ain't really got much on my mind
Other than I knew it when I first saw you

[Chorus]
You're feeling like a smooth ride
Bottle of gin makes the mood right
Babygirl you're looking like the
Moonlight in Atlanta
You're feeling like a smooth ride
Bottle of gin makes the mood right
Babygirl you're looking like the
Moonlight in Atlanta

[Outro]
Baby let your hair down
