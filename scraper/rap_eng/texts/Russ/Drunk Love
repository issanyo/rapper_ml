[Intro]
And this gon' probably ruin it
And I should just be through with it
But I wanna see the story end
Yeah, I wanna see the story end
And this gon' probably ruin it
And I should just be through with it
But I wanna see the story end
Yeah, I wanna see the story end
Got accustomed to the fast life (got accustomed to the fast life)
That slow lane’s too slow (that slow lane’s too slow)
So know that you don’t act right (so know that you don’t act right)
That novocaine’s no joke (that novocaine’s no joke)
Oooh (oooh)

[Verse]
Prob'ly gonna be on probation soon
Should’ve listened to my mom, she said
These girls wanna lay with you
But you catch fleas when you lay with dogs, I said
Throw me a bone
Walked out the house without a leash on
I just wanna roam
Jumped in my Nissan, checked my phone
“Come pick us up, we don’t wanna be alone
Ain’t no catch, we just trynna get thrown”
So I pull up and the tears start flowin'
Both black eyes and a broken soul
One miscarriage and a broken home
“So where you wanna go?”
They say, “we don’t care”
Shoulda turned around right there
They just wanna get the fuck away from here
I shoulda turned around right there
I hope this isn’t

[Outro]
Drunk love (damn)
It’s over when it’s sober
Drunk love
Your memory is gone
Drunk love
It’s over when it’s sober
Drunk love
Remember me tomorrow
