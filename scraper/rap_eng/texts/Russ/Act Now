[Intro]
Yeah
Just 'cause I don't say anythin' doesn't mean I don't see it

[Chorus]
Mmm, it's funny how they act now (yeah)
It's funny how they change up quick
It's funny how they act now
It's funny 'cause they ain't on shit
I'm laughin' like lalalalalala
Nanananananananana
Nananananana
It's funny how they act now

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm tryna go on my phone less and less these days
And I don't talk to women 'less it's sex these days
I'm on my second presidential Rolex these days
I could chill but I would rather flex these days
Man, I'm blessed these days, never forget these days
Took a lot of long nights, just to get these days
And to be honest, I think I'm the best these days
You got now but I think that I'm next these days
Follow my gut, I never second guess these days
I passed my test 'cause all I see is checks these days
Say it direct these days with your chest these days
Got some real life monsters on the text these days
I saw the gross but I wonder what you net these days
A few legends but way too many trends these days
I'm not impressed these days, I invest these days
Runnin' the game but you won't ever see me sweat these days
Set my intent these days, I invent these days
I do me at all times, I don't regret these days
I be gettin' everybody's girl wet these days
People quiet 'cause they know I'm a threat these days, yeah

[Chorus]
Mmm, it's funny how they act now (yeah)
It's funny how they change up quick
It's funny how they act now
It's funny 'cause they ain't on shit
I'm laughin' like lalalalalala
Nanananananananana
Nananananana
It's funny how they act now

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh, I'm diplomatic when I have to be
I got like 20 women mad at me, damn
150 on me casually
This didn't happen over night, I had to build this shit up gradually
Hope they see the truth is what I tell myself
No one felt me until I felt myself
These poppin' girls got way too many rapper bodies
I can't wife a girl who's fucked half of my colleagues
This is for every dude that hates me
'Cause women wanna date me
I put in work, I earned my stripes
I'm like the Yankees
I swear lately I been tryna wrap my head around this life
Used to sleep on couches, now it's thousand for the night
I'm winnin', you losin', I know that it irks you
European flag shit, I got stars in my circle
Look at my life, look at my come up, look how far that I made it
Honestly, if you don't feel inspired by it, you hatin'
Your first and last name don't mean shit
So I got women that I only know by zip code
I was down to stunt with you, now I gotta stunt on you
Nanananananana

[Chorus]
Mmm, it's funny how they act now (yeah)
It's funny how they change up quick
It's funny how they act now
It's funny 'cause they ain't on shit
I'm laughin' like lalalalalala
Nanananananananana
Nananananana
It's funny how they act now
