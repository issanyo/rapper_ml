[Hook: Russ]
When you feel like breaking down
Yeah, just go up
Woa-ooh, just go up
Roll in a pile of mula
Mo' money mo' problem
When you feel like breaking down
Yeah, just go up
Woa-ooh, just go up
Roll in a pile of mula

[Verse 1: Russ]
I got some shit that I don't wanna' think about
I can't play down, it's heavy so it's weighing down
But I'm drinking and I'm fucking to distract me
So pour up that cup and tell that girl get at me
Miss Dominican, Miss Arabian
Ignoring all the Omens, even Damien
Just play me when you need me
Let me fuck you when I want to
Baby I'm a dreamer
I'm not really tryna' haunt you
You can fall through
I might even leave you gas money
Might have you asking God asking did you ask for me
Drink that glass for, shake that ass for me
Then don't ask for me, light that match for me
Let the love burn out, then just ash from me
Yeah I think I'm God, is that just blasphemy?

[Hook: Russ]
When you feel like breaking down
Yeah, just go up
Woa-ooh, just go up
Roll in a pile of mula
Mo' money mo' problem
When you feel like breaking down
Yeah, just go up
Woa-ooh, just go up
Roll in a pile of mula

[Verse 2: Russ]
Ex girl workin' my nerves got me feeling like chokin'
And my dads ex family's really out here provoking
I'm just tryna' channel everything and remain focus
Cause I wanna' get my mom a house and my sister a rover
Damn, fuck all the acting without asking
The answer's in the questions, people just don't ask them
But for now I'm laughin', dreamin' of an Aston
Cruisin' down the freeway
Fresh off a three way
Bugus roll like three J's
And we headed towards the palace view
Bad bitches, swimmin', mansion, Malibu

[Refrain: Elizabeth Johnston]
Look up in the sky, you'll see
The light that leads you to be free
Don't be scared, don't look down
Cause it's almost over now

[Hook: Russ]
When you feel like breaking down
Yeah, just go up
Woa-ooh, just go up
Roll in a pile of mula
Mo' money mo' problem
When you feel like breaking down
Yeah, just go up
Woa-ooh, just go up
Roll in a pile of mula
