[Pre-Chorus]
The image of your frown
It's so alive
Makes me feel so dead
Just wanna make you smile

[Chorus]
Just believe that I'm gonna take you where you want
I'm gonna show you paradise
And we're gonna live there forever

[Pre-Chorus]
The image of your frown
It's so alive
Makes me feel so dead
Just wanna make you smile

[Chorus]
Just believe that I'm gonna take you where you want
I'm gonna show you paradise
And we're gonna live there forever

[Pre-Chorus]
The image of your frown
It's so alive
Makes me feel so dead
Just wanna make you smile

[Chorus]
Just believe that I'm gonna take you where you want
I'm gonna show you paradise
And we're gonna live there forever

[Bridge]
Know I love you, ma, this is all for you
House by the beach with the swimming pool

[Chorus]
Just believe that I'm gonna take you where you want
I'm gonna show you paradise
And we're gonna live there forever
