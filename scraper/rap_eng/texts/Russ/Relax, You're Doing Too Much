[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
You're doing too much
Swear to god, you're doing too much
Wah, you're doing so much
Just relax, just relax
Yeah, you're doing too much
Wah, you're doing so much
Tell me why you're doing so much
Just relax

[Verse 1]
I like to buy my ego
Running from the rat race
Pitched in through the people
That I dished it like a half day
And God plays probably a little bit too much
But my lesbian chick owe me their head
She's my fruit punch
Total round sun down
They're gonna fuck the moon I tell you
Rayna she can join in just turn my nap
Toes up dismember all your members yeah
I'm coming through with crew cuts
And I never liked snakes in my hair like Medusa
Moved up to two cups I used to get stoned
New sluts to school [?] my tuba till I'm blown
I just had to get off
Pants our passion
Visualize and making it happen
Maybe i should fasten my seat belt cause
My training Das is on a railroad it's on a fast track
To laughing to the bank no D-Rail
Hate now love later
Playing around in the playground and I'm the playmaker
Make way just plays best
Its a bet that I'm up next
I'll take your money and your people
And if she calls me honey
Then she's got to leave because
She's buzzing to close get the fuck about my hive and all that loving you quote once turned a ho into a wife
Hate to break it
Looking up to famous people is your downfall
Living boxed in is why I can't be around y'all
My crowns on bossed up King shit
This Jack made me wanna fuck Queens brain drinking
What's up

[Chorus]
Yeah, you're doing too much
Swear to god, you're doing too much
Wah, you're doing so much
Just relax, just relax
Yeah, you're doing too much
Wah, you're doing so much
Tell me why you're doing so much
Just relax

[Verse 2]
Yeah I used to fuck this Mexican when I was 17
My dad told me it was dangerous but it doesn't seem
So irrelevant caught up in teen embellishment
Fucking next to bullet holes
Tell the baby daddy I'm innocent
Don't need those problems in my life across the street
Her older brother so my survey every site and especially at night
I got the bethoven in some rundown apartments
Finding out what makes the most
I ain't tryna start shit
Fuck

[Chorus]
Yeah, you're doing too much
Swear to god, you're doing too much
Wah, you're doing so much
Just relax, just relax
Yeah, you're doing too much
Wah, you're doing so much
Tell me why you're doing so much
Just relax
