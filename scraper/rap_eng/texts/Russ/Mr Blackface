[Intro]
"We as black people are getting laughed at, I wanna take us past that"

[Hook]

You can call me black face, black face, black face
Brown, brown, brown
Call me Mr Blackface, blackface, blackface
When I come around, round round
Ghetto God Nigga

[Verse 1]

Fuck my money up, now I got to re-up
All I rock is Gucci, Louis, Prada, fuck Adidas
Gold in my mouth, I do anything for riches
I'm a fake nigga, but I love True Religions
Never try me, in front of some bitches
Baby I'm a nigga, I spent thousands on my riches
Little on these Jays, Little on these chains
Got a lot on my body but got nothing on my brain

[Hook]

You can call me black face, black face, black face
Brown, brown, brown
Call me Mr Blackface, blackface, blackface
When I come around, round round
Ghetto God Nigga

[Verse 2]

Bitch I'm buck, I'm feeling drunk, I'm in the club I'm tryna' fuck
Are you a bad bitch, a bad bitch, come and get this nut
I see bad bitches, bad bitches, all I see is bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches, all I need is bad bitches
Thinking with my dick and shit, see you looking thick and shit
Yeah I got my girl back home but thats some different shit
Grab my balls and dick and shit, nigga this that nigga shit
Bitch I'm buck so come fuck with this ignorance

[Hook]

You can call me black face, black face, black face
Brown, brown, brown
Call me Mr Blackface, blackface, blackface
When I come around, round round
Ghetto God Nigga

[Verse 3]

Whips and chains, whips and chains, all I see is whips and chains
Mental slaves, mental slaves, all I see are mental slaves
Get you chain, look at how vain you look, look at how lame you look
Look at your jays, look at how gay you look
Look at how fake you look
Field niggas, Field niggas, you ain't real you field niggas
Real niggas, real niggas, what happened to all of the real niggas
Looking like a blackface stereotype, now you got the white man scared of you type
Lost in vanity, fucking insane,blackface lifestyle drugging your brain
Looking for you life in the 40 ounce
Pop that, Glock that 40 out
Niggas don't read no books, so I had to make a song, then I had to find a place to place this information on
Cause this racial real estate is what they built this nation on

[Hook]

You can call me black face, black face, black face
Brown, brown, brown
Call me Mr Blackface, blackface, blackface
When I come around, round round
Ghetto God Nigga

[Outro]
