[Intro]
Yeah, I mean I've been here before but
You're lucky I don't see you
I'm just gonna make a couple million off of you

[Hook]
I could get used to you
This ain't the liquor girl it's all me
I could get used to you
You know I want you and you want me

[Verse 1]
Girl realize
Life feels better when you love somebody
Know it's been a while since I trust somebody
So tonight
Come clean so that we can keep on pushin'
I don't wanna have to go and keep on lookin'

[Hook]
I could get used to you
This ain't the liquor girl it's all me
I could get used to you
You know I want you and you want me

[Verse 2]
Can't be wasting records on bitches that don't deserve it
But I'm 'bout to make a million off this, guess it's worth it
You lied from the jump
Bout fucking rappers who get star struck
When they meet me, you give it up
To anyone who's got a moniker
Damn, I'm not the only rapper that's a follower
Damn, Your older brother must hate you
Your parents hate the fake relationships and vacations where
They take you and fake date you
They're offended cause they raised you
I be singing like Akon but bitch I'm not Akon
I blame you, for the lies that you told to my face
I'm a joke this a game yea I get it what a shame
You're a hoe I got the texts to prove it
I just hope for your sake I don't fucking lose it

[Hook]
I could get used to you
This ain't the liquor girl it's all me
I could get used to you
You know I want you and you want me

[Bridge]
Open up for me, ohhh
Open up for me, ohhh

[Hook]
I could get used to you
This ain't the liquor girl it's all me
I could get used to you
You know I want you and you want me
