[Hook]
Baby I'm amazed by you
We just haven't met yet
I get lost in a maze with you
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet
Baby I'm amazed by you
We just haven't met yet
I get lost in a maze with you
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet

[Verse 1]
You're probably out wildin' with your friends right now
That's fine girl, me too
I been at the booty club four times this week
Damn, I need you
Wonder what's your vibe, what you look
What you smell, what you taste, what you fuck like?
I don't care about any wrongs in your past
I just care if you love right
I think I fell in love with you
We just haven't met yet
I would drop my hoes for you
We just haven't met yet

[Pre-Hook]
Couple tickets in the holster
I would fly you out right now, just let me know
Who you are, what you want, when you want it
Why you want it, how you want this to go?

[Hook]
Baby I'm amazed by you
We just haven't met yet
I get lost in a maze with you
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet
Baby I'm amazed by you
We just haven't met yet
I get lost in a maze with you
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet

[Verse 2]
My mama set the bar so high
I won't lie, though you coming real close
I like that you care about real life shit
Not eyebrows and clothes
I like that you got a lot of bodies
You a freak, but that's all in the past
I like that you got a good brain, good morals
Its not all in the ass
I'd get on one knee for you
We just haven't met yet
We're perfect for each other, I swear
We just haven't met yet

[Pre-Hook]
Couple tickets in the holster
I would fly you out right now, just let me know
Who you are, what you want, when you want it
Why you want it, how you want this to go?

[Hook]
Baby I'm amazed by you
We just haven't met yet
I get lost in a maze with you
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet
Baby I'm amazed by you
We just haven't met yet
I get lost in a maze with you
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet
