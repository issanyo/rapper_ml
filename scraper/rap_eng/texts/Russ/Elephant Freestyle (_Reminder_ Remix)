[Intro]
Eloi eloi lama sabach'
With a crockpot
Ha-ha, ha-ha
Alright, here we go (ah)

[Verse]
I am an elephant, that pussy is heaven-sent
I signed my name on the clit, the bitch she is into it
Look: (skrrr)
She strokin' the trunk, she ain't even drunk
I might try my luck, I might try to fuck (smash)
You might see me from your truck
When you're roaming through the Serengeti
'cause that's where I be, eating green leaves
At the watering hole
Coming up with mean schemes (schemin')

'cause I'm an elephant, coulda been the president
Lions looking at me like "we know not to test him" (don't try it)
And they know that I turn bodies into skeletons
With these tusks, boy, I'm ready for war (ready)
Knock you back and forth like you was a fuckin' screen door
Then step on you and call you the dance floor

I've never been scared of a mouse (never)
My only ambition is to get more clout
See my neck and you know that I am iced out (bling)
Look into my eyes, I am off the xans
A pachyderm from Pakistan
Doing whatever I can to get the money in my hand (ch-ching)
Don't call me Horton, fam, I don't appreciate it
Call me Dumbo, liable to get your face hit (fucker)
I'm just a regular elephant
With the gray skin that's so elegant
With the ears that look like giant leaves
I fucked your bitch once
Then she called me back like "please" (please)

[Outro]
Yo, yo (grah). This Harlem bop the other day had the nerve to call me a 'mammoth without fur'... I told her "trust me bitch, I'm gonna remember that one." Word to Dumbo. Savannah gang twenty-seventeen, we in this bitch. Holla at me, whaddup
