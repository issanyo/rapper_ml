[Hook: Russ]
I'ma always put in work like this
I don't know how to stop being turnt like this
I'ma always go up
Ain't no time for hold up
I'ma always put in work like this
I don't know how to stop being turnt like this
I'ma always go up
Ain't no time for hold up

[Verse 1: squire]
I ain't got no time to waste
Gotta' drop at least a rhyme a day
Got caught up in my grind
At least I ain't living where my momma stay
Tryna' have my momma stay
Somewhere fly and far away
From where this drama stay
Be peaceful like namaste
So Imma' stay focused though she don't agree with my focus
I ain't one of these vultures
God gave me talent
We need balance
I know my purpose and it go deeper than the surface
Bunch of serpents in this circus
Truth is wealth
So my soul is not for purchase
Go up

[Hook: Russ]
I'ma always put in work like this
I don't know how to stop being turnt like this
I'ma always go up
Ain't no time for hold up
I'ma always put in work like this
I don't know how to stop being turnt like this
I'ma always go up
Ain't no time for hold up

[Verse 2: Seba]
Nee geen tijd voor te flexen
Check me werk op de tafel
Ge zijt niet daar op me level
Ik heb de vibes in me kamer
High is uw stem maar da hoort erbij-bij
Vaak weg en het noorden kwijt
Omdat ik, vaak denk en m'n ogen sluit
En, hooguit thuis in m'n zone
Aan het dromen als een tiener
Mag m'n hoofd toch niet verliezen
Als m'n liedjes in uw playlist staan
Eyo Russ, get'm up

[Verse 3: Russ]
I could change your life
With one conversation
Everyone's a star
Everyone's a constellation
I mix patience with ambition and hope that I get gratitude
Other times I hope that I get Spanish chicks with attitude
I'm tryna' get this platform
Upgrade my residence and cash out
Stay away from chicks who only take pics with  titties and they ass out
Welcome to America
Home of the broken living in a glass house
When you ask about me

[Hook: Russ]
I'ma always put in work like this
I don't know how to stop being turnt like this
I'ma always go up
Ain't no time for hold up
I'ma always put in work like this
I don't know how to stop being turnt like this
I'ma always go up
Ain't no time for hold up
