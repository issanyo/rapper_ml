Do my thing to it
Give it everything I got
Put my being to it
N if the melody is hot
Ima sing to it
Maybe roll a couple up
You can think to it
Maybe drink to it
Put the world on it
I know a couple side dudes who
Put ya girl on it
Watch people bump limp then turn n jump ship like a pirate
Bitch I been sick
Sickness turned into a virus
Into a outbreak
Death toll outrageous
Sick melodies
All my hooks are contagious
Money for my style cuz
What is cheap is less good
If you want free style take yo ass to Tim Westwood
Right now it's Deion prime time the moment
Everything I be on it's my time I own it
All the time
All the time that's what I do
Live in the moment
My potential has no roof I call it homeless
The numbers came back
We got the new data
Haters still on the sideline
A million views later
Turn the television off
All they do is outdate us
I'ma tell the fucking truth til the truth sounds famous
Gotta gamble every day
Turn my city into Vegas
I was fighting for my life
My self esteem was Al Haymon
N over here we don't respect receipts
Without payments
N I been gettin everybody's love
Without Raymond
I'm leaving on tour
The shows keep calling me
My dates online
I call the tour e-harmony
Being only hood is only good in the movie
Crabs in the barrel get turnt into sushi
Now in my phone I only store the numbers of the wealthy
I only fuck with Apple
I call it being healthy
Check the scoreboard
I only score a lot
I drink 100 proof
I take a high percentage shot
Drinkin rum n it's easy
Drink it like milk
Come thru freak me treat me like Silk
I remember back in 2012 Russ dropped Velvet
That shit was so ahead motherfuckers bought helmets
Songs got dressed n the hooks got belted
When they got the album people
Sang it like their selfish rap star on the verse
Niggas sounded like kings
Rockstar on the hook
Niggas sounded like Queen
People really need to jump off my mothafuckin penis
Jumpin on a jet like its a mother fuckin remix
N I'm a mothafuckin genius
It's DIEMON til I leave this bitch
DIEMON finna lead this bitch
DIEMON finna free this bitch
I'm USA n I still oversee this shit
Auto pilot now my thoughts
On higher plane
Fuck fame
I genuinely desire change
White washed so they selling black to us
Try to take our confidence
N sell it back to us
Advertisers everywhere gettin new money
They make that shit for 2 dollars
Sell for 200
All because we like shoes
N we like cars n we like phones
N we like rings the things to that go with the clothes hats n the bags & jackets
N the fine fabrics
Self esteem is where the price tag is
Catch up boy
Relish my intelligence
Life tailor made
Mama gave God my measurements
Self esteem & confidence
Searchin seven continents
You say no I hear yes
Bitch I'm an optimist
Gotta consequer self
'fore you conquer any plan
Gotta do for self before you do for any man
God knows I'm a holy man as the night drags
Heaven knows I go the old me waiving white flags
Devils know they can't hold me
Ima fight back
Ima always be Bugus
