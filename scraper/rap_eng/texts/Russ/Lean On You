[Verse 1]
You got me, I got ya
Mi casa, su casa
Even through our 70s, '70s like Donna
Ice or the lava
You lean on me, I lean on you
If you need a breakdown
You can take a break now
I pick up the pieces
Put 'em back in place now
We just build each other up
You lean on me, I lean on you

[Hook]
Lean on me
(Just lean on me tonight)
Lean on you
Lean on me
(Just lean on me tonight)
Lean on you
Lean on me
(Just lean on me tonight)
Lean on you
Lean on me
(Just lean on me tonight)
Lean on you

[Verse 2]
Did it my way, no regret so far
My love knew I would get so far
If it was easy wouldn't flex so hard
Against all odds and despite the hate
We keep going, always finding a way
They stay behind like a license plate (mm, yeah)
Got your back, you got my back
You won't let me get off track
If I'm down, you pick up the slack (mm, yeah)
Took a solid stance, we're both in a trance
Saw my plan, seen you in the stands
Noticed by my fans (mm, yeah)

[Hook]
Lean on me
(Just lean on me tonight)
Lean on you
Lean on me
(Just lean on me tonight)
Lean on you
Lean on me
(Just lean on me tonight)
Lean on you
Lean on me
(Just lean on me tonight)
Lean on you

[Outro]
I lean on you, you lean on me
I lean on you, you lean on me
I lean on you, you lean on me
