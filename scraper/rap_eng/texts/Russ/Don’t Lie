[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
You know who you are
This for you
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby, don't lie to me
I don't know why you need
To just lie, lie, lie
Tell me why, why, why
Ooh yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I been sippin' gin, you been sippin' Hennessy
I'm just tryna figure out why you pressin' me
'Cause you the one who's been Slick like Rick though
Pretendin' to be innocent but you a nympho
Who am I to judge? I know I got hoes too
But you're the only girl I wanna get close to
Girl, I meant every word that I told you
I feel like I don't know you, but I know you
Multiple women like a Saudi prince, (I'm coming)
Straight from Atlanta, Fulton county shit (I got a)
Soft spot for hard headed women with potential
The type of chicks who be fuckin' me confidential
I cut 'em off for you, probably too early though
'Cause you be fuckin' while textin' me, don't worry whoa
I see the game that you runnin', so I'm off you
I ain't gon' call you, all I gotta say is

[Chorus]
Baby, don't lie to me
I don't know why you need
To just lie, lie, lie
Tell me why, why, why
Ooh yeah

[Bridge]
I jumped in your pool, I dove head first
I don't operate off fear
If I'm not near the one I love
I'ma love the one I'm near
That's how you move, baby, I'm the same
But we don't gotta play that game
Just come through, fuck with me
I just hope it's not too late

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I can tell you been dealin' with pussys
You regular with famous bodies, you feelin' your pussy
'Cause you ain't ever been rejected, you're just constantly requested
I'm the only one that's told you "no" and that shit makes you question
Everythin' you thought about the power that your pussy holds
'Cause I got what they want, if I fuck you, your pussy's gold
You're used to these tier twos, I know what you got pierced too
I thought that shit was between you and me

[Chorus]
Baby, don't lie to me
I don't know why you need
To just lie, lie, lie
Tell me why, why, why
Ooh yeah

[Outro]
This be for all of the women that just be lyin' and sinnin'
Thinkin' I don't know, yeah
I'm more connected than ever and when you see me, do better
Just know there's no hope
For you, you, you
Yeah, for you, you, you
