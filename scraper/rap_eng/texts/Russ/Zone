[VERSE 1]
We ballin
Please keep lookin
I'm gone wit yo woman
If she keep lookin

So please keep pushin

And we keep cookin
Fans want shows n we keep bookin

Lookin at em
Cuz he neva gave a flyin fuck how they look at
At em
Sips some tequila n out comes ya ego
Talkin out the side of ya mouth at heroes
Look at up the scoreboard it still says zero
We ain't shakin hands we gotta amigos
Ima whoop that ass Ima take you round ringer
Leave you hungover u ain't gotta b a drinker
Imma win every time on you little thinkers
Champ ring sitting on my middle finger

[HOOK]
Do what I do
Boy you gotta be ruthless
Go against me
Boy you gotta be stupid
They don't want war with a man with a movement
Zoned out when I do it

[VERSE 2]
You all hyped all gassed off Molly
In real life I got reach like Ali

You all talk and it's too cheap
I watch fall off I don't sleep
They call me people's champ
People choose me
You switchin up every season gotta new team
You went n double up ans came wit a new thing
It's not enough u still endin up losin
Never talkin with these critics
No debate for the panelists
All ya negativity i just take it channel it
You can fake ya bank account
You can fake what ya balance is
Van fake a lot shit but can't fake if ya talented

You gotta deal with the fact I'm goin farther than you
Heavy sweater than you
Ya no competitor you
You gotta deal wit the fact i'm jus better than you

[HOOK]
