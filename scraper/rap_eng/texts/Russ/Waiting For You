[Hook: Rexx Life Raj]
And just so you know
I've been waiting for you
And I know what you came for, I came for it too
Soon as you walk through that door it's on
No more waiting, I'm here now
So you can let you guard down tonight
Ayyo, ayyo, ahh
So you can let your guard down tonight
Ayyo, ayyo, ahh
So you can let your guard down tonight

[Verse 1: Rexx Life Raj]
I brought the fire, I might let you roll it up
Might let you act like you're in control
But we really know what's up, ayy
We really know, we don't got to front, no
Nobody knows, you know it stay between us
My little secret, my little only hit me on the weekend
When she don't got no plans, she don't got no man
She don't want no man
She just wants some love (she just wants some love)
Someone she can trust

[Hook: Rexx Life Raj]
And just so you know
I've been waiting for you
I know what you came for, I came for it too
Soon as you walk through that door it's on
No more waiting, I'm here now
So you can let you guard down tonight
Ayyo, ayyo, ahh
So you can let your guard down tonight
Ayyo, ayyo, ahh
So you can let your guard down tonight

[Verse 2: Russ]
Don't do too much
You should just leave your trust issues in Atlanta
NYC I just flew you up
And as you walk through that door you knew
I'm obviously a real one
So you should let your guard down tonight
I don't know you like that, but I wish
I would never ever call you my bitch
I would only call you wife, I would only do you right
I would talk literature, I would talk Deepak
I would pump you up like Reebok
He's not me don't compare us
Just truuust

[Hook: Rexx Life Raj]
And just so you know
I've been waiting for you
And I know what you came for, I came for it too
Soon as you walk through that door it's on
No more waiting, I'm here now
So you can let you guard down tonight
Ayyo, ayyo, ahh
So you can let your guard down tonight
Ayyo, ayyo, ahh
So you can let your guard down tonight
Ayyo, ayyo, ahh
Ayyo, ayyo, ahh
Ayyo, ayyo, ahh
Ayyo, ayyo, ahh
Ayyo, ayyo, ahh
