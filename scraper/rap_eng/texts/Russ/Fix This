[Chorus]
I'm dealin' with a lot of pain
I don't know which way to go
Tell it all to go away
But it be comin' back for more
Mama, I've had enough, fix this
Sometimes it's just too much, fix this

[Verse]
I feel weak when I cry
But I just been strong too long
Please just make it stop, yea
Sleep is my only escape
From all of the pain
But I hardly ever sleep
'Cause I have nightmares daily, I feel crazy
Rock a fake smile, What I see is not what they see
New York City, I was ballin' in a penthouse
Never saw this comin', need to call my mom and vent now

[Chorus]
I'm dealin' with a lot of pain
I don't know which way to go
Tell it all to go away
But it be comin' back for more
Mama, I've had enough, fix this
Sometimes it's just too much, fix this

[Bridge]
Devil breathin' down my neck
I can't lie, I've thought about death
I think that I need to let go
Happiness is all that I show
What a show, what a show, what a show

[Chorus]
I'm dealin' with a lot of pain
I don't know which way to go
Tell it all to go away
But it be comin' back for more
Mama, I've had enough, fix this
Sometimes it's just too much, fix this
