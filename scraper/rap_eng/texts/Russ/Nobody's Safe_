[Chorus]
Nobody's safe, nobody's safe
I'm comin' at everyone's neck
Nobody's safe
I used to have patience
I think I just lost it
You're talkin' real crazy
Proceed with caution, takin' no losses
Nobody's safe

[Verse 1]
FedEx just left (What'd you get?)
I got a pack
I opened it up (What's inside?)
The album went platinum
The haters are sick
I keep gettin' rich
I'm the new sex symbol in rap, your bitch on my dick
They poppin' and sippin', Henny and lean
They think it's a joke
This shit ain't [?]
I turned it into a life (get paid)
[?] ignorin' the code
Tryna turn them into wives

[Chorus]
Nobody's safe, nobody's safe
I'm comin' at everyone's neck
Nobody's safe
I used to have patience
I think I just lost it
You're talkin' real crazy
Proceed with caution, takin' no losses
Nobody's safe

[Verse 2]
You wonder why you never see me too much
But you be on the scene too much
[?]
Shout out to the city though, well connected
How you think I went to the trenches on the Southside, at the D Mall shot a video
Every nother' other mili so
I'm done talkin' if you never done shit
I'm done listenin' to your assumptions
I'm countin' up money in abundance
I'm winnin', I'm winnin', I'm winnin'
They say that all my raps too pop-pop
They mad that all my rap shits pop-pop
They know that I do it for Papap
May he rest in peace

[Chorus]
Nobody's safe, nobody's safe
I'm comin' at everyone's neck
Nobody's safe
I used to have patience
I think I just lost it
You're talkin' real crazy
Proceed with caution, takin' no losses
Nobody's safe
