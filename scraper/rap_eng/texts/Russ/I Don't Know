So tell me, tell me, why
Tell me where we live, where we die
Tell me what we do, how high, how high

[Bridge: Russ]
I think I'm growing wings
Imma be a king
Let me just think
Let me just drink

Just a good king running from bad karma
One mans start is the same mans armor
No I can't ignore what I need what I wanna'
