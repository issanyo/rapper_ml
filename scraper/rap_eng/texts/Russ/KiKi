[Produced by Russ]

[Hook: Russ]
You are my world
I'm goin' crazy
Cause you make me feel
Like my feelings ain't even for real
But you are my girl
That's why I'm crazy
That's why I feel
Like there's nobody in the world but you

[Verse 1: Russ]
Yeah, keep a couple hoes just to fill the void
Ya'll drop shit but don't make a sound
I'm out here makin' noise
List of accomplishments
Longer than your excuses
Everybody has a choice
Live neutral or make a movement
Used to only see money with Washington's face on it
Now I'm doing a show out in Washington State on 'em

[Bridge: Russ]
Used to love Keyanna
'Til she showed me all her colors
I wrote this hook before I wrote this verse
Fuck that motherfucker

[Hook: Russ]
You are my world
I'm goin' crazy
Cause you make me feel
Like my feelings ain't even for real
But you are my girl
That's why I'm crazy
That's why I feel
Like there's nobody in the world but you

[Verse 2: Russ]
Yeah, wonderin' who or where and why and hows of you
I was bout to cop that place in New York house, and you?
But I found the truth, you went and fucked that corny rapper
You ain't use no logic
I'm the one
You realized after
Lacking guidance parents dipped on you
Damn they left a mark
You've been bullshtting for so long
Your life ain't really start

[Bridge: Russ]
Used to love Keyanna
'Til she show me all her colors

[Verse 3]
Yeah, your mom hit me up, I'm glad to see you talk to her
But she's cuffed to false sense of a reality of her daughter
I'm sorry misses officer, there's a lot of words that I could say
Fuck it if you wanna' go there
Then I'll go there and press this send
For my chest, to my brain, to my words, to your soul
So that it's gonna fuck you up
Your daughter doesn't fit your mold

[Bridge: Russ]
I used to love your daughter
'Til she show me all her colors
