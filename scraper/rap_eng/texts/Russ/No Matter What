[Hook: Russ]
No matter what you do
No matter where you stay
No matter how you dress
You should love yourself today
No matter what I do
No matter where I stay
No matter how I dress
Me and you, we are the same

[Verse 1: Russ]
Stop what you doin'
Look around and take it
All in mutha fukkas out here stallin'
Talking to the devil, keeping God on hold
But turn around and ask God why ain't I ballin'?
Self belief is the seed you can flourish
Stop comparing, be your own person
Mom talking, dad talking, brother talking, sis talking
When are you gonna realize your own purpose?

[Hook: Russ]
No matter what you do
No matter where you stay
No matter how you dress
You should love yourself today
No matter what I do
No matter where I stay
No matter how I dress
Me and you, we are the same

[Verse 2: Russ]
You a student with a job and a baby
But baby daddys on a block, actin' crazy
Selling drugs that's a trick on the whip
But that cash is so much bigger than him
But you a bitch if you call him on it
Dreams on a back burner
Cause you got a kid who needs freedom
Like Nat Turner
Lot more drinking
Lot less lovin'
Lot more thinking
Lot less fuckin'
Looking for a reason
To believe in leavin'
The father of your child
But your son need a man to look up to
So who's gon' teach him
Your heart got takin'
Where's Liam Neeson?
When you need him
Steady chief-in'
Just to take the stress away
It was all good like yesterday
But baby girl you should love yourself
Everybody, everybody you should love yourself

[Hook: Russ]
No matter what you do
No matter where you stay
No matter how you dress
You should love yourself today
No matter what I do
No matter where I stay
No matter how I dress
Me and you, we are the same

[Refrain: Russ]
Sometimes we get lost
In the middle of nowhere
But sometimes in the middle of nowhere
We found ourselves living
And now nowhere turns
Into somewhere
There's nothing
There's something
'Til something
Is everything
Damn

[Hook: Russ]
No matter what you do
No matter where you stay
No matter how you dress
You should love yourself today
No matter what I do
No matter where I stay
No matter how I dress
Me and you, we are the same
