[Verse: Russ]
Honolulu views sippin on some fresh guava
Bumping always knew and thinkin' 'bout my next comma
I put my thoughts into the world until they come true
You chase women I'm the one that they run to
"Russ moves smart this is something you could learn from"
Rappers pay attention maybe you can finally earn something
Low overhead, I don't need other people
Cause everybody on my team is two other people
Multi-faceted
I remember imagining livin' how I'm livin'
Now everything is extravagant
Jets rolexs, new women, new deals
Can't let the fake game try to tell you who's real
Cause they gon' try to but you gotta see through shit
You don't have to sell your soul, I'm the proof
This is millionaire weed, kush like Regis
I sound like an angel and I look like Jesus
That's what the women tell me
Fuck it imma run with it
You ain't gonna get the throne back until I'm done with it
Money flow like water, yea I'm getting Fiji checks
I'm huge in Honolulu, no wonder why Kiki (Waikiki) left
I'm detached from anything y'all attached too
I'm in n out with my groupies like fast food
Who's the greatest say Russ when they ask you
I sell out shows quick enough to always add two
I laugh too cause some promoters are slackin
But shoutout Cara Lewis always gets me a backend
Meaning you can sleep but we got that covered
You blew up in the spring and you were gone that summer
Money at my feet life's a cake walk
They love me out in Asia you would think I made K Pop
Too many j kwons, not enough Raekwon's
Rappers use the same beat and flow and make the same song
I swear the last few months have been the best few months
I can't wait to see what happens in the next few months
And I can tell you only come around when success does
You only check for me when a check does
Ten blunts couldn't get you higher than me
Cause I'm high off becoming what I aspired to be
You outdated like shirts by Ed Hardy
You know they always show up late to the best party
