[Verse: Russ]
I swear this world's about to get flipped upside down
It's R-U double S just fucking up your town
My idols fucked up so it's me I gotta' take it
Y'all just complacent and content with being basic
But yet y'all look confused like, "where is my love?"
And do you realize this whole world is much bigger than these clubs
But it's okay just keep on fucking up, it's cool
Y'all make it easy for my shit to stand out,  ooo
I got that neewww, oooo-oooohh, yeah
I'm coming through, I got that juice
You poisoning, this entire youth
With all your lies, it's time for the truth
Make sure you know what it is
Make sure that you tell it, spread it, yeah
