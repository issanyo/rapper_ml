[Intro]
Yeah
They prolly gonna call this hate
But people always hate the truth
Fuck it

[Chorus]
Postin' drugs all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' guns all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' money all the time, don't fall for it
Don't fall for it
Postin' drugs all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' guns all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' money all the time, don't fall for it
Don't fall for it (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Promotin' lean but they say they're for the youth-type artists
"Do as I say, not as I do"-type artist
Y'all are locust, poisonin' the youth for clicks
What's your addiction gotta do with always postin' it?
Smilin', playin' games, makin' skits, makin' jokes with it
You can't say you're opposed to it when you're constantly promotin' it
Y'all Instagrams are drug abuse, how-to's, y'all condonin' it
How you care about the youth, but constantly corrodin' it?
Now I won't say that you facadin' the pain
But you definitely postin' drugs as a marketing game
You targeting fame, you can fool the youth, but not me
You raisin' the next generation of addicts on IG
I promise you, that's not a very promisin' youth
You hate the truth, that's why the truth is botherin' you
I know, your drugs get more likes than your music does
That's why you post more drugs than your own music, huh?

[Chorus]
Postin' drugs all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' guns all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' money all the time, don't fall for it
Don't fall for it
Postin' drugs all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' guns all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' money all the time, don't fall for it
Don't fall for it (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Lotta rappers tellin' on themselves for likes, it's a gimmick
You don't use guns, it just helps sell the image
If you really pullin' triggers, you don't post guns
'Cause you know they use that picture to take you from home, umm
You gotta image to uphold, I get it, you and your face tats
You the tough guy who can't be tried, who always stays strapped
Yeah, I see through it, you post gats and tec's
Cause without it lotta your songs just lack context
Makin' posts, braggin' 'bout some modified shit
In the hopes that it evokes some more Spotify hits
From the impressionable youth, that's followin' you
'Cause you ain't scarin' no one grown, and no one true
This ain't news to anybody in the know, uh
But there's rules, y'all are fuckin' up the code, uh
The only thing y'all would ever shoot is the messenger
A lotta kid's favorite rapper is a wrestler

[Chorus]
Postin' drugs all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' guns all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' money all the time, don't fall for it
Don't fall for it
Postin' drugs all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' guns all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' money all the time, don't fall for it
Don't fall for it (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Lotta rappers are broke, flyin' coach and be postin'
Fake chains from jewelers who just want their promotion
Always showin' twenties with fives and ones
You gotta hundred on each side to disguise the funds
Flip through it, show us the denominations
You should call the IRS and get some payment confirmations
I know your deals 'cause these lawyers talk
You ain't a boss, you got a boss, let your employer talk
Y'all in royalty splits, plus you signed to a guy that just did a JV
Now you signed to a guy, that's signed to a company, and they got gluttony
They 'gon eat and give you what's left, I feel the oven heat
From here, too many cooks in the kitchen, look around
You don't own shit from your masters to your account
Plus y'all don't tour, no TuneCore, your buzz plummetin'
No indie catalog, you gave away your publishin'

[Chorus]
Postin' drugs all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' guns all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' money all the time, don't fall for it
Don't fall for it
Postin' drugs all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' guns all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' money all the time, don't fall for it
Don't fall for it
