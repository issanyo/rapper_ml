[Hook: Russ]
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon

[Verse 1: Russ]
So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being 22
Tryna' find a way to slow this down
But these wheels just keep on turnin'

[Bridge: Russ]
I'm playing in a game I can't win
But I still play like I can't lose

[Hook: Russ]
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon

[Verse 2: Russ]
Stop growin' up so fast
I remember when I held you
You're still a baby to me
You'll always be that way to me

[Bridge: Russ]
I'm playing in a game I can't win
But I still play like I can't lose

[Hook: Russ]
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon

[Verse 3: Russ]
You've always been there for me
I've never lived a day without you
I still got so much to learn
You can't leave me

[Bridge]
I'm playing in a game I can't win
But I still play like I can't lose

[Hook x2: Russ]
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon
