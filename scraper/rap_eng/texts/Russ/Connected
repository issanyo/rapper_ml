[Intro: Russ]
Ooh
I hope you feel what I'm
I hope you feel what I'm saying

[Verse: Russ]
Yeah
Connected to the infinite
Hope you feel the same way
Don't let the lies blind you and misguide you
Find the gateway
To the truth
I found my portal in this booth
I'm moving with the universe
Hope the world follows suit
'Cause it's less about diamonds, more about hearts
Less about bein' in the clubs, and drinkin' Spades to play the part

The flame I spark is from the embers
Of the truth we all belong to
The truth we all came from
That'll be here when we're gone too

Watching from a distance like a hawk
I see the prisons
That men and women build inside their mind and choose to live in
Or rather die in
'Cause that's not living if you ask me
Misery loves company, and it's happy just to latchkey

Child who learned, to be alone and fell in love with it
Unspoken agreement with the soul
Don't break the covenant
I'm glad you see the surface but what matters is what's under it
But don't get too attached because that path just leads to sufferin'

When you start stumblin'
Don't grab a liquor bottle and start guzzlin'
Try to chase your hate away and replace it with your love of gin
Till it's 1 AM and you've been gone
And you looking for the answer
But don't wanna answer
When the answer's been calling
I said the answer's been calling you
I hope you pick up
Ooh I hope you pick up
I hope you feel connected
I hope you feel

[Instrumental]
