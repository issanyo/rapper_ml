[Verse 1: Rexx Life Raj]
I ain't call you perfect
You already know
They're tryna buy you drinks
They're tryna take you home
You're unimpressed, babe
You're in your zone
You're Mrs. Independent
You did it on your own
You got it right now

[Pre-Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
If we cannot make babies
Maybe we can make some time
We got shit to figure out
I can't get you off my mind
Do you ever think of me
I think about you all the time
I know I ain't the only one
So I'mma just fall in line
I'm no denier
Girl, you're inspiring me
You got that fire
You lit that fire in me
You're my desire
You're right where I wanna be
Girl, you're on fire
You lit that fire in me

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
We gon' burn baby, burn baby
Burn baby, burn
We gon' burn baby, burn baby
Burn baby, burn
We gon' burn baby, burn baby
Burn baby, burn
We gon' burn baby, burn baby
Burn baby, burn

[Verse 2: Russ]
I know you got a past, I got one too, yeah yeah
I'm way too lit, it's too late to say the truth, yeah yeah
Oh you bad and you lowkey
You're thinking one knee, I'm thinking both knees
Damn I was changing my ways for you
Spend money, spend nights, spend days with you
Spend planes on you, I would send you the jet
She's like "Russ, at least just send me a text"
I'm like "Yeah," she's like "Cool, on my way on down"
Next time I'm really in the A like that, I got you

[Pre-Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
If we cannot make babies
Maybe we can make some time
Do you ever think of me
I think about you all the time
I'm no denier
Girl, you're inspiring
You got that fire
You lit that fire in me
You're my desire
You're right where I wanna be
Girl you're on fire
You lit that fire in me

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
We gon' burn baby, burn baby
Burn baby, burn
We gon' burn baby, burn baby
Burn baby, burn
We gon' burn baby, burn baby
Burn baby, burn
We gon' burn baby, burn baby
Burn baby, burn
