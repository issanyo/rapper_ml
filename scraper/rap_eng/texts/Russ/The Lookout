Another lost soul, standing at a crossroad
Insanity is priceless, but I just heard the [unintelligible]
Maybe if I fall slow, I can land on both feet
Maybe if the song's slow, they can hear my bones speak
But then again it's limbo, nothing here is simple
Nothing's what it seems, every dream is a symbol
That makes you want float away
And smoke away every problems that you [unintelligible] away
So float away, float away motherfuckaaaa'

Yeah, are you good now?
Or are you feeling like you never could now?
For every voice of doubt there's a shout screaming success
But if you let the doubt in, I couldn't give a fuck less

Are you feeling good now? Feeling like you should now?
Catch you going down, catch you going down
I can be your lookout, easy as it looks now
Listen to the sound, your feet are  off the ground

And are you feeling good now? Feeling like you should now?
Catch you going down, catch you going down
I can be your lookout, easy as it looks now
Listen to the sound, your feet are off the ground

A lotta y'all enjoy the trap, but how is that so?
Don't you want to join the top?
The driver stop if you don't pass go
Even if you're speeding through a red light
Thinking it's the best night
Look beyond your head lights, the grass grows greener when you step aside your home
You say that you're too busy when your fate is on the phone
You've escaped what you've known all your life
Chasing highs, wasting times
Tricking, rolling dice with disasters
Gambling your laughter
Just because your daddy died doesn't make you a bastard
But still you're running after what he could have felt like
She grabs the needle in, feels what he felt like
This is what hell's like
She can't even spell life, let alone comprehend the meaning
And everyone around they acts like she don't even need them
But she's bleeding on the inside, smiling on the out
She's driving on the wrong side, drinking 'til she's out

Are you feeling good now? Feeling like you should now?
Catch you going down, catch you going down
I can be your lookout, easy as it looks now
Listen to the sound, your feet are off the ground

And are you feeling good now? Feeling like you should now?
Catch you going down, catch you going down
I can be your lookout, easy as it looks now
Listen to the sound, your feet are off the ground
