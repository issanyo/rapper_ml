[Intro]
Ah hold on, lemme try callin' him one time
*Phone rings*
Come on pick up man

[Chorus]
I've been callin' tryna get a hold of you, you (yeah, yeah)
Feelin' lost and I don't know what to do
So can  you get back to me?
So can you get back to me?
So can you get back to me?

[Verse 1]
I'm callin' god,  leavin' voicemails
I know you're there, I need to talk before my voice fails
Before your boy bails
'Cause they be takin' all the fun away
I'm listening to "Say Goodbye to Hollywood" and "Runaway"
I guess be careful what you wish for, right?
You say the truth and they come at you with pitchforks, right?
I'm in Copenhagen, overthinkin', every single moment, pacin'
Round and round the room, it's 4:00 AM, I'm at the phone just waitin'
For your call, I need a pep talk, God
It's getting harder to keep going I need a rest stop, God
I swear none of these massages get the stress off, God
Sometimes I swear I wanna get a gun and let off, God
Aim it right at my enemies, make the Devil obey me
They tryna kill me, can you blame me for the thoughts I have lately?
I know it sounds crazy, that's why I call daily
Please don't betray me, God can you save me? (pick up)

[Chorus]
I've been callin' tryna get a hold of you, you (yeah, yeah)
Feelin' lost and I don't know what to do
So can you get back to me?
So can you get back to me?
So can you get back to me?

[Verse 2]
Family issues make success bittersweet
Sometimes a cold shoulder's the only way to deliver heat
That's the situation that I'm in with my dad
Me and my mom dipped quick, no one lives with my dad
Yeah it's sad but he brought it onto himself
Last time we talked, we didn't talk, we just yelled
He knows he got issues, he told me he's gettin' help
'Til then I gotta put this relationship on the shelf
Deal with what I'm dealt, welp, boohoo right?
I shouldn't care 'cause I got houses and some new coupes, right?
But money's not an adhesive that can take all the pieces
Of a broken family and put them back together, arenas
Ain't as loud as inner turmoil, get to the roots, replace any burnt soil
While the world boils over fake problems with me
I just need 60 seconds, yo God, hit me (Please record your message)

[Chorus]
I've been callin' tryna get a hold of you, you (yeah, yeah)
Feelin' lost and I don't know what to do
So can you get back to me?
So can you get back to me?
So can you get back to me?

[Outro]
Fuck
I guess I'ma just keep callin'
One of these days you gonna pick up, hopefully
Yeah
