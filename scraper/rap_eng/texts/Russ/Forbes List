[Verse 1: Russ]
Taking shots like it's my occupation
I call the shots of my operation
Obligation of a boss
That's just something that you're born with
I ain't make the deans list
But I bet make the Forbes list
Couple corpses that I dated
Them bitches dead to me
I'm tryna' upgrade from local hoes
To celebrities
Get some fucking millions
Before my mom loses hope  Cop a castle for the queen
That comes equipped with a moat
I ain't worried if all eyes are on me yet
Cause I know imma' turn my Nissan into a P-Jet
I deflect any doubt thrown my way
Cause there's a whole lotta' fucking people
Who know my name

[Hook x2: Russ]
We gon' be alright
Money on the way we gon' be alright
Drinks on me we gon' be alright
You ain't gotta worry we gon' be alright

[Verse 2: Russ]
I'm tryna' build a skyscraper
Why you comfortable with condos?
This world can't swallow me
I'm fucking up it's tonsils
Quatros anos
It's time for a new president
If hype is what's sellin'
Someone tell me who's sellin' it
Nah fuck that Russ is organic
I'm showing you how to build
I'm showing you what my floor plan is
More cameras
More groupies
More stans it's all happening
I'm trafficking this magic
Getting cash for being passionate
Gotta' half of fifth up in my system
Hip hops got plots but ya boys twistin'
You dreading my arrival
I'm exposing where the bar is at
Pointing in the mirror
Tryna' show you where the star is at

[Hook x2: Russ]
We gon' be alright
Money on the way we gon' be alright
Drinks on me we gon' be alright
You ain't gotta worry we gon' be alright
