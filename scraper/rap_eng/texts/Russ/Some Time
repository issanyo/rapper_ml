[Intro]
Yeah
Mhmm
No, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Please don't call my phone, I need some time
Just to sit and think about my life
It's been every day nonstop every night
I just need some time, ooh
Please don't call my phone, I need some time
Just to sit and think about my life
It's been every day nonstop every night
I just need some time, oooh

[Verse 1]
Please don't call my phone, I don't got time to talk today
FaceTimin' without appointments, must have lost your way
Haven't even had the time to count the dollars made
I work on vacation, I don't take no holidays
I don't know what sleep is, I've been up since "Chain Hang Low"
Body rollin’ all night, that’s a place that they can go
Still ain't had a day off, life's been chaos, melee mode
I just need some time, sometimes I wish that they made clones

[Chorus]
Please don't call my phone, I need some time
Just to sit and think about my life
It's been every day nonstop every night
I just need some time, oooh
Please don't call my phone, I need some time
Just to sit and think about my life
It's been every day nonstop every night
I just need some time, oooh

[Verse 2]
Saw you turn your backs just to go and get a bag
I'm the best you ever had, now there ain't no coming back
This ain't gonna work, I'm too focused on my work
I just need some time, oooh
I ain't got time to talk small town shit
Diemon.com got all my hits
Lookin' at the world like it's on my shit
I ain't got time to talk all my shit
But I'm gonna try 'til the casket closes
Until they give me my roses
I just need some time, oooh

[Chorus]
Please don't call my phone, I need some time
Just to sit and think about my life
It's been every day nonstop every night
I just need some time, oooh
Please don't call my phone, I need some time
Just to sit and think about my life
It's been every day nonstop every night
I just need some time
