[Chorus]
Don't you worry bout it
Coffee right I'm gonna make it easy
Just go ahead take off tonight
Yeah


Everybody out here trying to get them motherfucking condos
We all screaming fuck this
Out here feeling like give me the million
Give me the platform for wanting
I might as well ask for it
Too much mileage
Mileage on the dashboard not enough stamps on my passport
Trying to let the bullshit fly by
Like a motherfucking matador ole
Spanish speaking chicas saying that she different
That's what hoe say

[Chorus]
Now don't you worry bout it
I'll pay it off
You're right there's coffee right
I'm gonna make it easy
Just go ahead take off tonight

Born in Chihuahua Mexico
A little bit of bark just to let you know
Move to the states when she was like seven
Who would have thought she found hell in heaven
Rebelling, black sheep of the family
Doing drugs way too early
Damn she's dropping out now
We're only seventeen
What the fuck is up now
Lotta coke, lotta reefer
Half of the family moved back cause of visas ya
Just heard from the dad
Before she got arrested
Month and a half in jail
Worried about getting deported
No papers 10K
Luckily some dude swoops
Sets her free but she's not include in
He's beaten, cheating into the lifestyle
She left him more rum shots
And moved in with another motherfucker not about shit she discovered your
Trick game throw him
Old enemy tryna turn to a new friend
Ofcourse she's better
Ofcourse she's got middle fingers up stupid nigga
Trying to think about life

[Chorus]
Ooo don't you worry bout it
Don't you worry bout it
