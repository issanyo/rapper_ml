Making classic everyday bitch
Yeah
Yeah same shit, sipping ciroc making classic
Do what the fuck I want
Fuck the low life
Yeah bitch
Yeah yeah bitch
Yeah knock knock
Hello world it's the motherfucking genius
Stop
Watch me so I plot like a seamstress, clocks
Hanging on my wall of achievements, stocks
Lightning off like a blunt, I'mma chief this
Dream with a team its complete game over
Diamond
We can make the Heat play colder
Shining
I'mma get a sweet Range Rover
Give it to my sister proceed to take over
Yeah
Every beat that I make is classic
Every leap of faith is a practice
Feet set waiting for for the world to pass it
Out in LA blowin jays off this rap shit
Knew that I can have it
Soon as I can find it
Jets out to NY feelin like a Giant
Young and so defiant with a purpose
I'm about to jump in a fire and I'm shirtless
Better call the nurses
Half away to t... ones
With a little accent, hips like handguns
Grips like phantoms
Huggin on the street
Me im hugging curves making hits in a sheets ha
Lips so sweet but the world so sour
So I'm dippin out for the money and the power
Lips so sweet but the world so sour
So I'm dippin out for the money and the power
Yeah
