[Hook x2: Russ]
I do the walkin'
You do the talkin'
I keep it, I keep it, I keep it movin'

[Verse 1: Russ]
Control yo' liquor
You do too much talking
Raps a sport
But you do too much jockin
Be smooth around that chick
Boy shes elevated
Be at peace with yo' self
Boy get meditated
You never jaded right now
Boy hold onto that
Cause you about to turn up
And you ain't wrong for that
Just remember why you started
And what you did it for
You were tryna' just vent
Fuck an aventador
You got a lion in you boy
Go head let it roar
Don't be nervous this is it
What you trembling for?
I know you wanna' tell those girls
That they messed up
I know you wanna' flaunt yo life
For your self doubt
But know that you're the next up

[Hook x4: Russ]
I do the walkin'
You do the talkin'
I keep it, I keep it, I keep it movin'

[Verse 2: Russ]
I know some family secrets
Got ya whole perspective changing
I know you lost a couple people
I know its devastating
I know you make a couple songs
Just to cope with it
I know some people get offended
Boy just go with it
I know you spend a lotta' money
That you might regret
But don't feel bad you made some moments
That you won't forget
I know you juggling a lot
I know you drink too much
Boy calm down it ain't life or death
Don't think too much

[Hook x2: Russ]
I do the walkin'
You do the talkin'
I keep it, I keep it, I keep it movin'

[Verse 3: John Anthony]
I heard that scared money
Don't make no money
Oh you wanted more
You gon' take some from me
Yo Russ lemme front you on this zip
I guess that I'm the pimp if this life's a bitch
Niggas tell me John talk that shit
From Ben Franks to the Washington's
Godly flow but this sin on fleek
Niggas tell me just spend don't teach
Everything we find we keep
What the hell would this reverend preach
With the devil all in my reach
If God is here then his armors breached
Million angels in my movie seats
Boy I made it off of Pryor
Where it's easier making it outta' fire
Where dope dealings a form of college
Guess Eve feeding me her papaya
From the masses to the messiah

[Hook x2: Russ]
I do the walkin'
You do the talkin'
I keep it, I keep it, I keep it movin'
