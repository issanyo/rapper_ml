[Chorus]
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
And I know that I shouldn't and I wouldn't if I could
And you know that this drink got me talkin, late night callin, yeah

Fell in love with a girl from PR, kept up online like PR
Had me waitin like a DR, stretch her out in her room like ER
I stumbled on your page got liquor in my thumbs I see you followin my path, my thought, and actions left crumbs

I thought that I left you in Atlanta
I thought that I'd never see you busy
I thought that without me you'd go down
I thought that you'd never leave the city

[Chorus]
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
And I know that I shouldn't and I wouldn't if I could
And you know that this drink got me talkin, late night callin, yeah

Out of state got a couple shows gettin' money
Hotel room with a ten and twenties
Scoop her, Uber, tryna manoeuvre, tryna test me but I studied
Got a little bit a hesitance, keep one eye on you like a wink
Sunset Boulevard, moonlight tint, off the sauce like ooo I slipped

I thought that I left you in Los Angeles
I thought that I'd never see you busy
I thought that without me you would go down
I thought that you'd never leave the city

[Chorus]
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
And I know that I shouldn't and I wouldn't if I could
And you know that this drink got me talkin, late night callin, yeah
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
And I know that I shouldn't and I wouldn't if I could
And you know that this drink got me talkin, late night callin, yeah
