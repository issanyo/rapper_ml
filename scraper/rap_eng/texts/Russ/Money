[Hook x2: Russ]
So I make money
Money don't make me
So I make money
Woah-woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oohh

[Verse 1: Russ]
Every night is celebratory bottles
And the boys are back in town
Plus Bugus got the studio smelling like a motherfucking pound
Photoshoots and Euro trips
Cash out when that euro hits
My bank account smell like a lotto
When that fucking euro flips
NYC to ATL
Cross the country to LA
Back to back to back to back
Overseas and U.S.A
That's the way my life is going
Keep up or get left behind
Baby I'm so 'bout it 'bout it
Baby I'm so 'bout it 'bout it
My agenda's far from hidden
My routine is non-existent
Handshakes and conversations
My religion is my vision
Sipping on that "anything is possible"
Bugus rollin' up that "fuck every single obstacle"
I'm off it, come on

[Hook x2: Russ]
So I make money
Money don't make me
So I make money
Woah-woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oohh

[Verse 2: Bugus]
I'm in the hole for 20,000
Got me sick in my stomach
I was on some holy shit
But now I need me some money
Cause I been too damn ashamed to hit my dad back
Cause I've been waiting trying to find how I can get these stacks back
What the fuck did I spend it on?
Swipe this, swipe that
Damn I walk up in the store
I like this, I like that
Bought a fucking plane ticket
Flight there, flight back
When I got there, I laid there, on the right mat
Right up in the five star
Oh, had the fine guard
Lined with the best suite, never lied ya'll
Some people never get it cause they never tried ya'll
They treat me different at the bank, I'm starting to like ya'll

[Hook x2: Russ]
So I make money
Money don't make me
So I make money
Woah-woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oohh
