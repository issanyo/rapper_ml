[Pre-Hook: Russ]
Baby girl your dead
Death by your disguise
Society got you fucked up
Living in a lie
Just remove that mask
Take off all that make up
Come up here and kick it with the realest
I can take ya'
To the other side
It's really do or die
Ye-eh-eahh
All I can promise
Is you're not alone
Yeah

[Hook: Russ]
All my angels fly
All around me
All my angels fly
All around me

[Refrain: Russ]
I think the world needs help
And I think uh
I think dudes
America is catered to you
The world is catered to you so
Excuse my while I talk to these uh
Females again

[Pre-Hook: Russ]
Baby girl your dead
Death by your disguise
Society got you fucked up
Living in a lie
Just remove that mask
Take off all that make up
Come up here and kick it with the realest
I can take ya'
To the other side
It's really do or die
Ye-eh-eahh
All I can promise
Is you're not alone
Yeah

[Hook: Russ]
All my angels fly
All around me
All my angels fly
All around me

[Outro: Russ]
Yeah
This is what it sounds like
When the storm
Meets the calm
Right before you pop
