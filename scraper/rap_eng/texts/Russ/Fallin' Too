[Hook]
If you fall, I'm fallin' too
If you call, I'm callin' too
What you want, I wanna do
Just tell me, and we can decide
I don't wanna fight, yeah yeah
If you fall, I'm fallin' too
If you call, I'm callin' too
What you want, I wanna do
Just tell me, and we can decide
I don't wanna fight, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm gettin' money now, everythin' changed quick
Part of me misses life in the basement
Back when everythin' was cool in the household
When I was gassed of a couple hundred downloads
Now I would never go back, the good outweighs the bad
But my mom thinks I don't love her, she blames it on my dad
Tension gettin' thicker than the girls I got in south beach
Arguments crazier than girls I got in Saudi
Got a bounty, on my head that's what it feels like
It's crazy when dreams become real life
Helpin' that my mom can give three racks
'Cause dad's been silent like 3 stacks
And money's got my family doin' backflips
I was broke, I ain't been back since
And everybody knows it, I got the fam up on my shoulders
I promise I'll blow up but won't blow it, yeah

[Hook]
If you fall, I'm fallin' too
If you call, I'm callin' too
What you want, I wanna do
Just tell me, and we can decide
I don't wanna fight, yeah yeah
If you fall, I'm fallin' too
If you call, I'm callin' too
What you want, I wanna do
Just tell me, and we can decide
I don't wanna fight, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Couple million liquid cash. I can pull out right now
Four chicks every night, I should pull out right now
I can't have a mistake, my dad acts like he had two
I love him that's my dad, I understand that he had to
Family matters, fuck a TV
Man I've known that
50k last week man, I've blown that
Mom's car got took, man I feel stressed
'Cause I got the couple cars parked on my neck, yes
Twenty weddin' rings chillin' on my necklace
Feelin' kind of guilty, please don't judge me off my entrance
'Cause this is new money, let me get handle on that
About to start moving militant, put the camo on it
Told dad, "Got to figure out the balance between helping y'all out
And knowin' ya'll can help me out it"
Damn, ya it could be better but it could be way worse
Hope we all stay together

[Hook]
If you fall, I'm fallin' too
If you call, I'm callin' too
What you want, I wanna do
Just tell me, and we can decide
I don't wanna fight, yeah yeah
If you fall, I'm fallin' too
If you call, I'm callin' too
What you want, I wanna do
Just tell me, and we can decide
I don't wanna fight, yeah yeah

[Outro]
Tell my mamma I'll be back
In a little, I'ma save her
No matter what went down
I don't care, I don't blame her
Yeah, yeah
Tell my mamma I'll be back
In a little, I'ma save her
No matter what went down
I don't care, I don't blame her
Yeah, yeah
