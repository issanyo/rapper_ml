[Verse 1]
I handed out two hundred thousand dollars
To my family and my friends
Don't tell me I don't care
I put in work, free time is rare
I know my worth, my food is shared
If you saw dirt, then you'll be there
To see the perks of millionaires
I distribute inspiration for the low
I treat you how you treat yourself, you just a ho
I took a break from you I'm seeing shit clearly now
Bitch I'm me, I can never let you near me now
I'm in Europe with my family crossing country like a track star
My wallet is a Travelex with a black card
I been doin' this, I been true to this
I been producing my career and Bugus'
I remember when my life wasn't like this
But I always saw this all coming, bitch I'm psychic
I remember always dropping beats and gettin' 10 plays
10 year flashbacks are feeling like 10 days
Damn, my numbers raised quick
They used to treat me like a little what-his-name and shit
I can't fuck the same chick for too long, I need options
Unless she put a spell on me like Emma Watson
I'm out in Auckland fucking with the kiwis
I got a barber in New York call him Tiki
I got a couple bitches down by Peachtree
Tell 'em read the writing on the wall like graffiti
I be sellin' out two in the same night
I came a long way, I used to have stage fright
That was back when me and Bu' was doin' college shows
Up in UGA gettin' paid next to nada though
Six deep in the Volvo or the Avalon
We was smokin' cookie but we do not fuck with Tagalongs
Everybody pulls their weight in the huddle
Bitches thinkin' they're unique
Because they save my name as Russell, whoa
You didn't want me 'til I got poppin'
Which means you probably wouldn't want me if I stop poppin'
Gettin' mailbox money, like assists from John Stockton
Gotta dream, [?] like assist from John [?]
Travel non-stop and it's city, new city
Same day-one's ain't got no one new with me
Couple new women I been adding to the roster
Couple new digits they been adding to the offers
Rap's new father got a few more kids
Broke rappers you should learn what a Tunecore is
I got a catalog that's more vast than the ocean
I'm good everywhere, I got a pass like I'm open
I'm grabbing the Golden Globe for the road
And I'm playing in my movie that I filmed myself
If your girl feels me it's 'cause I feel myself
If I woke up and was you I would kill myself (laughs)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Less rushin' more trustin' in the process
I'm screaming out "Less pussy, more progress"
You should talk less and do more homie
You were hot and now you real lukewarm homie
These are new times, you can see my 2 eyes
And tell that I was born to be different, I'm in Dubai
And I'm like 16 deep, that's what you get
When you paint 16's over 16 beats for like 16 weeks
In a row, times 6
That's like 96 songs
If you don't know my shit
I'ma question if you even follow hip hop
You probably follow magazines and what they think's hot
Dick-riders, politicians in plain clothes
Everyone in rap use the same beat and same flow
Uh, you're asleep, but your city's awake
Hate It or Love It's what I'm bumpin' makin' 50 a [?]
Plus the buzz gettin' bigger than 50 estate
Private jet coast to coast cost me 50 a way, whoa
Haters lookin' for some validation
I know you mad 'cause my life is your imagination
What's that?
Women in bundles every city that I move through
I bring in more money for your city than you do
The money's cool but the life is more glorious
I came in clutch for my family [?] shit
I hope the people take the time to read my story
It's a real page turner
Bob Seger I need 40 hits before I turn 30, uh
That's a goal of mine
A 2 hour sing along, damn, that's a show of mine
