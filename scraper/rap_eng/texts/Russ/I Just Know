[Chorus]
Yeah I just know
I'ma get it poppin', I'ma do my thang, I'ma blow the fuck up
Yeah I just know
I'ma cash out, stack hella Ms in my account
Yeah I just know
I'ma have my dream girl in my dream house and my dream car
I just know
I'ma be a legend, ain't no tellin' when, but
Yeah I just know

[Verse 1]
Platinum plaques, I see that in my near future
Asses fat all around me, I call all my chicks Medusa
Off this rap I been winnin', I could never be no loser
I got racks, I'll be pushin' Bentleys, you'll be pushin' Supras

[Chorus]
Yeah I just know
I'ma get it poppin', I'ma do my thang, I'ma blow the fuck up
Yeah I just know
I'ma cash out, stack hella Ms in my account
Yeah I just know
I'ma have my dream girl in my dream house and my dream car
I just know
I'ma be a legend, ain't no tellin' when, but
Yeah I just know

[Verse 2]
I'ma hit the dealership and just ball
Usually the driver is white and bald
60 plus and retired, I'm 24, I'm on fire
I just hire who I need, pay my dues, invest in me
Overstandin' everythin', trust my gut

[Chorus]
Yeah I just know
I'ma get it poppin', I'ma do my thang, I'ma blow the fuck up
Yeah I just know
I'ma cash out, stack hella Ms in my account
Yeah I just know
I'ma have my dream girl in my dream house and my dream car
I just know
I'ma be a legend, ain't no tellin' when, but
Yeah I just know

[Verse 3]
Sold out show that mean no tickets
I see everything I want, I'm 'bout to go get it
Sold out show that mean no tickets
I see everything I want, I'm 'bout to go get it

[Chorus]
Yeah I just know
I'ma get it poppin', I'ma do my thang, I'ma blow the fuck up
Yeah I just know
I'ma cash out, stack hella Ms in my account
Yeah I just know
I'ma have my dream girl in my dream house and my dream car
I just know
I'ma be a legend, ain't no tellin' when, but
Yeah I just know
