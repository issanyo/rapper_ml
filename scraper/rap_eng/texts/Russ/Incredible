Ima have to take em back
Back to April '96
Never knew that the fam was bout to take a major hit
Ya my uncle out drivin round riding with his chick
When a drunk driver came that's when they car got hit
They found liqour in his spit
THC all in his piss
Drunk driver cold killa ended up n gettin off wit it
Nothin changin in the south
Niggas still gettin lynched
Gave his killer house arrest and sent my mom a lousy check

[HOOK]
How you do that there?
That's incredible ya incredible that's incredible
How you do that there?
That's incredible ya incredible that's incredible
So incredible so incredible so incredible

[VERSE 2]
My homie went out to the bar
Never planned on losin his car
Couple shots had went down fast
Saw a young boy gettin harrassed
So he tried to bring peace to the scene
Stepped up tried to intervene
Owner wasn't hearin them speak
Kicked em both out made em both leave
Soon as they got outside
Young boy asked my homie for a ride
Before my homie could realize what happened had a gun in his side
Young boy pulled up out a pistol
Pistol whip to the gristle
Fucked up and took his keys
And left him on the ground asleep

[HOOK]
How you do that there?
That's incredible ya incredible that's incredible
How you do that there?
That's incredible ya incredible that's incredible
So incredible so incredible so incredible

[VERSE 3]
It was back in '96 when we came here
Granny buried her son and husband in the same year
Another crutch in the journey
Remember mournin for days
And then a crooked attorney stole all the money she saved
We raised a lot of money
We prayed so many nights
You raised her blood pressure
You almost took her life
Even though her world was taken down and broken apart
My Granny still got love in heart

[HOOK]
How you do that there?
That's incredible ya incredible that's incredible
How you do that there?
That's incredible ya incredible that's incredible
So incredible so incredible so incredible

I am my own man
I won't be broken
I am my own man
I won't be broken
