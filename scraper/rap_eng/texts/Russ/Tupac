[Intro: Russ]
Pac

[Chorus: Russ]
Come with me (come on)
All these rappers soundin' straight pussy (all of y'all mothafuckers)
What do we have here now (yeah)
Do you wanna ride or die
La-dadada-da-da-da-da (come on)
Come with me (you know you gotta come right when it's 2Pac)
All these rappers sounding straight pussy (all y'all sound like pussy)
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die (come on)
La-dadada-da-da-da-da

Let me let Pac tell y'all something

[2Pac]
And if you wonder why I'm mad, check the record
What's a nigga gotta do to get respected

[Verse 1: Russ]
Now if you with me then you with me, no flip floppin'
Driving on this rode to the dreams, no pit stoppin'
No criss-crossin', this ain't no Kid and Play
I ain't crazy, but I'm 'bout, a fifth away
Pour me up
Sounding big on 2Pac shit, like Notorious
Golden state of mind, this ain't no crime, we just Warriors
And ever since I recognized what I was doing here
I've been letting loose like fuck your rules, I got my crew in here
Even though it's dwindled
Me and Bugus, keep a closed circle
Pouring up that Tanqueray, with freaks
After we blow purple
It's no hurdles
Just opticals of illusion
Loose in the booth
I forgot to put my screws in
Chopped, not slopped, up top, like Houston
DJ Rucker got a mothafucka out here woosin'

[Chorus: Russ]
Come with me (y'all better come on now)
All these rappers soundin' straight pussy (all of y'all sound like bitches)
What do we have here now (yeah)
Do you wanna ride or die
La-dadada-da-da-da-da (come on)
Come with me (all of y'all mothafuckers sound weak)
All these rappers sounding straight pussy
What do we have here now (come on)
Do you wanna ride or die
La-dadada-da-da-da-da


[Outro: Russ]
Yeah

I don't know what else I gotta do, so
I've given y'all ten albums of original beats and shit
Since I was seventeen, so
Now I'ma come and show y'all How to Rob

Shoutout to 2Pac

I'ma spazz on mothafu...
Gettin' that ass on mothafu...

Y'all know what it is
