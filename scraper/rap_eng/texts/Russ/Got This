[Intro]
Yeah, ever since, ever since, yeah
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Ever since I got this you been tryna knock this
All you do is pop shit you ain't really on shit
This is for my team though we ain't with the nonsense
Keep it 103 though, all we do is top shit

[Verse 1]
I made everything come true, I feel like my own genie
You would think I got middle-eastern blood by the way the girls call me habibi
Thirty racks just popped up in my email damn what a life
I just did arenas, then I had a threesome, then I counted 40 bands damn what a night
This is that shit I asked for, I don't take shots with squares you a backboard
Fuck your stamps, I want stamps in my passport
Dance to my disc though we all want platforms
That's a 80's reference
A lotta rappers only hot for like 80 seconds
Don't pay me less than the promoter's makin'
Carry myself yeah my shoulder's aching

[Chorus]
Ever since I got this you been tryna knock this
All you do is pop shit you ain't really on shit
This is for my team though we ain't with the nonsense
Keep it 103 though, all we do is top shit
Ever since I got this you been tryna knock this
All you do is pop shit you ain't really on shit
This is for my team though we ain't with the nonsense
Keep it 103 though, all we do is top shit

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'ma get a jet, call it Netflix cause I'm done with commercials, yeah
Imma go diamond, but I still got love for my circle, yeah
When I land, hotel suite, king bed with a handful of queens
When I make it to the top elevator goes right back down to the team
That's OG bossed up wisdom, no sleep insomnia
Talkin to myself don't put us at the end that's obvious
Hope you catch that, Kylie showin love on Snapchat
21 hits on the way like Blackjack quicker than a flashback

[Chorus]
Ever since I got this you been tryna knock this
All you do is pop shit you ain't really on shit
This is for my team though we ain't with the nonsense
Keep it 103 though, all we do is top shit
Ever since I got this you been tryna knock this
All you do is pop shit you ain't really on shit
This is for my team though we ain't with the nonsense
Keep it 103 though, all we do is top shit
