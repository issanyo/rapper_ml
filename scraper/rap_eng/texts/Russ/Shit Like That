You ain't heard of shit like that?
Working all night, you know shit like that?
Cutting people off, you know shit like that?
Not enough money, but I spend it anyway
I'm tryna make it

[Verse 1: Russ]
I maneuver, I can smell the gouda
Me and Bugus got plans to sell out Abuja
Girls catching feelings, I ain't even throw shit
I just pay attention to the signs like a protest
If not me, then who?
If not now, then when?
Smoking by the pound, getting paid by the yen
Baby girl I'm global, in and out of zip codes
Make a lot of noise when I move, I don't tip toe
Dreams too big, I don't like small talk
We thank God, oh, yeah ahka
Give your girl vodka, now she acting single
Yeah shit like that, she know the lingo
Looking at life through the windshield
Not through the rear view
I've been turning up my life I don't hear you
Steer through the doubt, how I'm feeling lately
I'll never feed a mouth talking crazy

[Verse 2: Bugus]
Hit the runway like it's fashion week
Put in work like a slave, made a master piece
Still dark as night, came alive in the PM
African, but I drive European
People gotta squint, my future is blinding
I'm like, "watch, it's all about timing"
Flight so long that I picked up a hobby
My Volvo feel like a Bugatti
Accounts in the red like the '96 Bulls
Needed just push, now I got pull
Now I might take a white girl to Lagos
Sit and talk about race like its Talladega
Even though it dragged, my formula won
If I take an L, I'll be smoking a blunt
From the sound, we won like singles
Out of town, run wild like gringos
