[Intro: Russ]
Shit
I'm stumblin'

[Verse 1: Russ]
And let's get one thing straight
Swear I hear my name
Bouncing off these 4 walls
Tryna' to make me go insane
So I watch the cookie crumble
My sanity's on vacation
I see these rookies fumble
And wonder, how they made it
And around this time I pour up
Fantasize about four sluts
Getting freaky on a tour bus
If life's a bitch, she's gorgeous
I just need a plug
Cause I already got my outlet
And I already found my fountain
And I'm 19 but who's counting?

[Hook x2: Russ]
Okay I'm drinkin' now
And all this weed I'm smokin' got my thinkin' bout
What I don't know
What I don't see
Where I don't go
Where I don't leave

[Verse 2: Russ]
A plate may not be full
But it doesn't mean I'm not
I got this little sister
And I hate to see her cry
The tears are on her face
Swimming till they drop
I tell her it's okay
She says I'm all she got
I said, "Pick your head up, wipe your eyes
I know it's getting harder every day but life is life
You gonna' be okay, cause I said so
I've been down that road before
I've been down that road before"

[Hook x2: Russ]
Okay I'm drinkin' now
And all this weed I'm smokin' got my thinkin' bout
What I don't know
What I don't see
Where I don't go
Where I don't leave
