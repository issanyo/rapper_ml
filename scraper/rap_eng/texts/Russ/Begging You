[Intro]
Yeah
I'm beggin' you

[Chorus]
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you

[Post-Chorus]
Time goes on
I hope I stay strong
Don't you stop right now
You can't stop right now
Time goes on
I hope I stay strong
Don't you stop right now
You can't stop right now

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
I can't take it anymore, I need a break
Faith lookin' slim, and my doubts gaining weight
Dad on meds, doctors say he's bipolar
I'm scared that I'ma turn out like that when I'm older
Haven't been in love since I was droppin' mixtapes
Built up a wall, swear it's tall, like 6'8
I don't wanna spend my 20s on the road
To spend my 30s wondering why I'm alone
I might buy a 40, take it straight to the head
50,000 dollars could get all my haters dead
I won't even feel it and they won't even trace it
Devil sees my blessings, swear to God he's tryna take it
Guess I gotta pray that I will not engage that
'Nother sleepless night, dark circles are my face tats
Middle finger aimed at anywhere the pain's at
RIP Pop pop, wish that I could change that, yeah

[Chorus]
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you

[Post-Chorus]
Time goes on
I hope I stay strong
Don't you stop right now
You can't stop right now
Time goes on
I hope I stay strong
Don't you stop right now
You can't stop right now

[Verse 2]
Got a face full of scruff like Shia LaBeouf
Tryna find some love, dipped off in the cut
I don't wanna talk right now
Even though I need to talk right now
But I'm hidin', I'm lonesome
I can't seem to shake this off
This zoo is a nuisance
I'm steady tryna break these walls
Yeah
I'm takin' care of my family, I'm sending wires like texts
I got a lot of mouths to feed, I'm 'bout to hire a chef
It's all on me, I gotta get the bag like Mike Conley
And hope the money's always on time like Ashanti
Omni-present, gotta be everywhere
For my family, for my friends, for my fans
It's not fair to myself, but it is what it is
I'm runnin' low on self-care, but it is what it is (fuck it)

[Chorus]
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you

[Post-Chorus]
Time goes on
I hope I stay strong
Don't you stop right now
You can't stop right now
Time goes on
I hope I stay strong
Don't you stop right now
You can't stop right now
