[Chorus]
Baby, you're a one of one to me
I know that I should probably wife you up
And baby I swear I'm done with these
Other women, they don't mean shit to me

[Verse 1]
You was tryna know me when they didn't know me
Girl we fell in love, we both worked at the mall
Way before the Rollie, you was just my homie
You were tryna love way before I had it all
We workin' minimum wage
I needa see you, I switch days
Meaning I switch shifts
Revvin' my engine
Looking back ashamed we were only a phase

[Chorus]
Baby, you're a one of one to me
I know that I should probably wife you up
And baby I swear I'm done with these
Other women, they don't mean shit to me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm turning down the rest for you
If they call us foul, I'm fighting all the refs for you
You make me a better me, I make you a better you
Riding with the top off looking like the letter "U"
Teaching you the language of the universe Rosetta who?
Put you on a pedestal
All eyes on me but you loved me when I had seven views
You lookin' like I should go half on a baby with you
And if I'm wrong, I won't debate it with you
I'll own up to it, you voluptuous
They not down for the curves but I'm up to it
Come gimme all that
You the only girl I'll call back
I tell these other women fall back
They be hating on the preview
They think that it's only for the entertainment
Like E! News
I can see the sequel
Let's do more I do's and less redos

[Chorus]
Baby, you're a one of one to me
I know that I should probably wife you up
And baby I swear I'm done with these
Other women, they don't mean shit to me
