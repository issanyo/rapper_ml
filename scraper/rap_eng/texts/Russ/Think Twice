[Chorus]
Lose, lose conversations
I'm 'bout to lose patience
Said this in the basement
I can't front now
It's takin' everything in me not to say shit
So much fake shit ever since I made it
I won't ever be quiet cause I'm famous
Y'all gon' hate this (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
This ain't no average Joe shit, this is everyday Russell
Joe got a day job, that's an everyday struggle
This for all the slow rappers who subliminally diss
You can at it, you can text it but you'd rather be bitch
But it's hard to hear the hate over these waves crashing
I think your time is up, I think your waves crashing
All that fade catching you promoting shit is all talk
The difference is my life is still lit when I log off, pussy go head

[Chorus]
Lose, lose conversations
I'm 'bout to lose patience
Said this in the basement
I can't front now
It's takin' everything in me not to say shit
So much fake shit ever since I made it
I won't ever be quiet cause I'm famous
Y'all gon' hate this (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Fuck these fake alliances
I don't be buying shit, it's not in my interest
You be window shopping, I be buying it
I'm fly as shit
Just keep in mind what position you in
If you lucky I might make a song and diss you again
And when I say you, I meant you too
They call me Bono
Rappers sending subtweets, rappers stealing logos
Rappers feeling jumpy
Then bounce pussy, pogo
This gon' get a billion streams
This for the rappers who need promo
This for rappers who need other rappers hooks to go bronze
This for rappers who need other rappers shows to go on
(Go off)
These for rappers who still suck still
Six years later you still stuck still
Still on the uphill
There's some rappers who won't be here by the next June
There's some rappers who still asking for some leg room
I just give em half a bar like they give themselves
I kick back and watch these losers go and kill themselves

[Chorus]
Lose, lose conversations
I'm 'bout to lose patience
Said this in the basement
I can't front now
It's takin' everything in me not to say shit
So much fake shit ever since I made it
I won't ever be quiet cause I'm famous
Y'all gon' hate this (yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
These junkie ass rappers basing brands off of drug addiction
And I'm the bad guy for calling it out?
You the one who got kids od'ing tryna be like you
And I'm the bad guy for calling it out?
Yeah, yeah
