[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, just copped a mansion and my parents a crib
Listening to doubt never worked for me but my arrogance did
They love to hate, they love to hate, how ironic, I know
She loves my long hair and my tattoos, how iconic, I know
Women pounce often and my sound poppin'
Y'all are clout hoppin', while I'm house shoppin'
You should make more moves and less announcements
I'm having sex with spouses
Watch me invest and count this, I got the best accountants
I'm looking at the aftermath off all my hours
Unfortunately, I rarely take the time to smell my flowers
Used to move around a lot, used to have to pack houses
Now I'm on the road playing shows for packed houses
Now I'm in Toronto smokin' maple leaves
I got the catalog of branches outside of the label's tree
You can't label me, I made all my shots
But that was when the crowd was ghost
Now the world is watching me, time to go repeat results

[Chorus]
I'm an outlaw
I do my thing and talk my shit and run my mouth off
I never really ever gave a fuck about y'all
I got a lot of hits left like a southpaw
Without y'all

[Verse 2]
I've been in the Dominican swimmin' in thick women
With skin like cinnamon, bitch it's a Tuesday
Don't you ever talk to me crazy, you still got roommates
Went platinum out a suitcase
Y'all too fake, your debut came and went
I'm throwin' a coup de
Ta da bitch, I'm here, y'all pop up and disappear
I want Priyanka in Bahamas, I want 20 mil' this year
What y'all know 'bout doin' sold out shows around the globe?
I bring the hoes out, the come-up's documented, you should scroll down
And peep game, you can say he changed 'cause he went and achieved fame
But he landed where he aimed
So fuck the chest you thumpin', fuck the threats you publish
I'm up in your city doin' shows, address is public
I never listened to the churches
I listen to Kanye, Eminem, Nipsey, J. Cole, Kendrick, Drake and Jay-Z verses
Rap is the new sermon, rappers are the preachers
Rappers are the doctors and the teachers, the world needs us
C'mon!

[Chorus]
I'm an outlaw
I do my thing and talk my shit and run my mouth off
I never really ever gave a fuck about y'all
I got a lot of hits left like a southpaw
Without y'all

[Verse 3]
People say I'm cocky, people say I'm arrogant
I think lack of confidence is very un-American
Miss me with comparisons
Y'all can't hold a candle to me, you gon' need more paraffin
Bunch of fuckin' zombies poppin' pills and sippin' heroin
Y'all are so embarrassin'
Got your wifey runnin' all her fingers through my hair again
I'm starin' in her soul, your bitch has no control
She's lookin' at my platinum plaques, your bitch ass still ain't gold
I'm hot globally, you popped locally
I'm noticing this game hasn't really noticed me
It's okay, I understand, I wasn't in your plan
But y'all gon' come around 'cause I'm the motherfuckin' man
I was right about what? I was wrong about when?
I'm livin' right right now, 'cause I was right back then
I was right about what? I was wrong about when?
I'm livin' right right now, 'cause I was right back then, bitch

[Chorus]
I'm an outlaw
I do my thing and talk my shit and run my mouth off
I never really ever gave a fuck about y'all
I got a lot of hits left like a southpaw
Without y'all
I'm an outlaw
I do my thing and talk my shit and run my mouth off
I never really ever gave a fuck about y'all
I got a lot of hits left like a southpaw
Without y'all
