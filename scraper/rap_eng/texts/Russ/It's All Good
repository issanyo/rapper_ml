[Vers 1]
Fall 8 times, 9 times I'ma get up
Voices in my head tell me start fuckin' shit up
Just know I gotta make a move
It's in my DNA
Just know it got something brewing like UCLA
Look player, I been doing this shit for awhile
It's not new to me
I was riding high hit the ground learned a lesson while down
Ain't nothing u can do to me
First of the month
Now its time to pay the rent
Time is money
Got no time to play pretend
Got me in the game
Time to find a way to win
I done opened up enough
Time to b the main event
My intuition won
Time to get the mission done
So long to the days of having insufficient funds
I'm at the bottom
Givin this game everything that I got bout to rap my up to the top

[Hook]
Ya my girl just left
It's all good tho
Ya my fam going thru it
It's all good tho
Ya the money kinda low
It's all good tho
Ya I might take an L
It's all good tho
It's all good tho
It's all good tho
It's all good tho

[Verse 2]
Niggas keep bitchin
I keep tryin'
Demons start livin' when dreams start dying
Any sign of progression is like a message from Jehova
Last 6 months I been sleeping on a sofa
But I ain't trippin', I know where I'm outta be in a minute
Nike gonna do a deal
When they find out I did it
Sleepin' in the studio I got songs to make
Graduated with no money I got loans to pay
All he do is give his best
Stil he gets oppressed
Lotta cess in my chest
To suppress the stress
Got stretched the checks
Never get finessed
Even I got less I still know I'm blessed

[Hook]
Ya my girl just left
It's all good tho
Ya my fam going thru it
It's all good tho
Ya the money kinda low
It's all good tho
Ya I might take an L
It's all good tho
It's all good tho
It's all good tho
It's all good tho

[Verse 3]
Me no want no gold chain
Me no want no sneaker
Wanna be the best thing coming thru your speaker
Man had Becky now looking for Onika
That girl left me, she never was a keeper
That girl left me, she never was a keeper

[Hook]
Ya my girl just left
It's all good tho
Ya my fam going thru it
It's all good tho
Ya the money kinda low
It's all good tho
Ya I might take an L
It's all good tho
It's all good tho
It's all good tho
It's all good tho
