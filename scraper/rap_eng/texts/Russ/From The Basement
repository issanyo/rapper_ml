Got Maison Margela on to cover my eyes
From a basment
Ya mofuckas touchin the sky
Im inspired by people like Madiba
& the front page of Ebony and Don Diva
Takin all bets now ya who wanna a wager
Im an Idol in America like Fantasia
Wanna an island in the sun like we Weezer
Witta blunt fulla salad gotta mean ceaser
I don't know when i turned to a mean geezer
In the summer time my heart still a deep freezer
Call it like it is no exaggeration
Most brand new artists get a cancellation
Fans switch sides quick n it's like treason
Rappers don't even make it to the next season
Me i'm focused on havin longevity til im 70
Gave em  something light
Now they fuck with me heavily
They love me from spots A -listers run to
All to the way to the blocks you gotta bring a gun to
Gotta move around wit pistols that'll open ya
Only want peace but i don't live in no utopia
Tryna live my life tryna make a cornucopia
I don't  fear shit dog i never had a phobia
And each word paint pictures for the blind people
And if ya lost this kinda shitll find people
Bout to take it around  the world like i'm Beatles
Runnin outta hotels like Don Cheedle
Empty out my mind with all that I can think of
Self made millionaire I know I'm on the brink of
Fair to say at first I was lost but I got it now
Fair to say I got more bars than a college town
Fair to say I gave my life so it's well deserved
Fair to say I really came and found purpose on this Earth
Fair to say i ducked all these glorified dick suckers
Got traffic now like Rush Hour Chris Tucker
Funny how these grown men follow other grown men
It's a shame you lame motherfuckers ought to to repent
I blaze weed thinkin how ima cover my rent
I played beats every single time I wanted to vent
Always for the lookin the answer
It was inside of me
Overthinking i'm a cancer
Guess it's just a side of me
Real good at this game
Whole game Monopoly
I don't even stop at stop signs no stoppin me
You should be cool and understand how i'm kickin it
I could really get on some super ignorant nigga shit
They say with no autotune they say no ones listening
I say it's bullshit it's a game n Im fixin it
I say Im bout to be all the change that I wanna see
I say Im bout to be everything that I wanna be
Believed when they saw the shit work
Motherfucker I believed and that's why the shit worked
I was talkin Greg Street talkin like 6 oclock
All you motherfuckers livin life got tickin clocks
If you, you really really wanna maximize
Sit yo ass down and strategize
This shit DIEMON it's a mastermind
I do me watch it happen over time
And i'm watching things change but I still be the same
Ain't no suit & ties i rock tees & chains
It's Bugus get it right don't fuck up my name
She gotta body but she loving how i'm fuckin her brain
I want someone that I wanna fuck
Right after I lust
I want someone I can be around right after I bust
If the cameras on us you gon see day ones
Real pain behind the music like VH1
I don't kick with niggas that wanna act hard
I''m tryna move around and swipe me a black card
I don't kick with niggas that wanna act hard
I''m tryna move around and swipe me a black card
Motherfucker
