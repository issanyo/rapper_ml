[Hook: Russ]
I know some things
I got some things
That make me cry tears
Make me cry tears
I know some things
I got some things
That make me cry tears
Make me cry tears

[Verse 1: Russ]
I been walkin thru
Tryna follow you
I swear its true
I swear its true
Last thing you said
To me was that
Hey you look cool
You look cool

[Bridge: Russ]
I shoulda been there for you
I shoulda been there with you
I shoulda called that show off
I'd rather miss that than miss you
Wish we had more time
Thought I had more time
Thought that I was gonna come back
And you'd be fine

[Hook: Russ]
I know some things
I got some things
That make me cry tears
Make me cry tears
I know some things
I got some things
That make me cry tears
Make me cry tears

[Hook: Russ]
I owe this all to you
You introduced me to myself
Its true
I swear its true
And even though you're gone
You taught me music never dies no
You could never die

[Bridge: Russ]
I shoulda been there for you
I shoulda been there with you
I shoulda called that show off
I'd rather miss that than miss you
Wish we had more time
Thought I had more time
Thought that I was gonna come back
And you'd be fine

[Hook: Russ]
I know some things
I got some things
That make me cry tears
Make me cry tears
I know some things
I got some things
That make me cry tears
Make me cry tears

[Outro: Russ]
I shoulda been there for you
I shoulda been there with you
I shoulda called that show off
I'd rather miss that than miss you
Wish we had more time
Thought I had more time
Thought that I was gonna come back
And you'd be fine
