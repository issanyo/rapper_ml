[Verse 1: Bugus]
It's been a long ass journey on this road
Its me and my nigga Russ we came to let you bitches know
Russ got the bounce like six fo
I'm at the store buying blunts the citgo's closed
The studio is crushed with some new flows
Tough like a group home
My style mean my sweet sixteens are full of glucose
So you know you could never step to me
Russ got the recipe I'll leave the rest to destiny
