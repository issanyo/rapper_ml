HOOK (Russ):
Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger
(Maybe, you should pull the fucking trigger)
Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate just shoot

VERSE 1 (Beez):
Yeah… I’m a soldier I’m a soldier
It sucks that everyone that talks to me will turn they shoulder
Yeah… By the year I’m getting colder
I’m 19 now, I’m getting a little older

A little wiser, stay away from the political
Due to what I did in the past I’m an individual
Cause no one understands the miracle that I’m alive
I’m 'bout to fucking murder this lyrical exercise

Like I said before I be alone cause no one gets me
If the rap game was hockey, I’m the young Wayne Gretzgy
So come check me and my mental, your life is simple
My life is complex, I digest this instrumental

I’m rated R like the pirates, you wanna see what’s under
But you can’t you’re PG-13 oklahoma city thunder
Put 'em in a blender, my mind’s dark like I’m bender
You shoot me a message now, it return to sender (yo, Russ)

HOOK (Russ):
Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate just shoot

VERSE 2 (Beez):
Let me tell you about this story
It’s about my low point, not talking glory
Never told nobody, but now I feel it’s mandatory
Necessary anyway, I was at the park, after dark
Balling out getting rings like Robert Horry (hm)

We won some in a row, the local cats they didn’t like that
Big dude came to push my boy, and asked “You 'gon fight back?”
We been in this predicament before, yeah I know so
My boy socked him in the face and left him leaking in the snow

"Here we go," in my head I said, because his crew had stepped up
My buddy he was joking said “You guys can suck my left nut!”
I laughed a little, 'till the 5 across me pulled the guns out
I was frozen cause I know shit happens when the sun’s down

I yelled loud, said "Yo this really isn’t how it has to be”
Guess what happened next, leaking dude threw a strap at me
They told me "Kill your boy, Or we’ll rock you both
And where’s that smirk, how come you niggas stopped the jokes?"

The Glock was locked and loaded, I could feel it
I looked at my boy, his face was white like anemic
As a matter of fact, I think we both looked defeated
I felt so nervous I took a breath and stopped breathin’

I Knew what I had to do, just to save my life, made sure the aim was right
Does that make me selfish? But I was helpless
I wasn’t a killer, but you gotta do the things you do
So if you get into my way, might pull the trigger on you too (damn)

HOOK (Russ):
Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate just shoot
Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate just shoot
