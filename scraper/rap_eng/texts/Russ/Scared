[Chorus]
Take my hand and rock it real slow
I wanna feel your love tonight
Let's put the world on pause and get drunk off these city lights
I'm all about us tonight
Ooh, I'm scared to fall in love again
Ooh, I'm scared to fall in love again

[Verse 1]
Yeah, tried to give you everything, I was thinking wedding ring
You were cheating every chance you got while I was faithful
Then you went with who you, told me not to worry 'bout
Now you got a baby with him, damn, that could've been me
Can't say that I hate you, if I had the money
That I have now, I would've taken you away from
Everything that killed us, would have seen the real us
Now I'm scared of falling in love again

[Chorus]
Take my hand and rock it real slow
I wanna feel your love tonight
Let's put the world on pause and get drunk off these city lights
I'm all about us tonight
Ooh, I'm scared to fall in love again
Ooh, I'm scared to fall in love again

[Verse 2]
Yeah, tryna help you see the truth
But you prolly won't look
I just wanna hear your story
Like a audio book
You knew me before my ex, yeah
We stayed at the W, yeah
Better not fuck my name up
Like a substitute, yeah
I can tell you wanna do it but you don't know how to do it
'Cause you're scared to death
You can tell I wanna do it but I don't know how to do it
'Cause I'm scared to death
We should grab each other's hands and take a jump off the cliff
And hope we fly
Then you pause and I pause and we look at each other
But we both know why

[Chorus]
Take my hand and rock it real slow
I wanna feel your love tonight
Let's put the world on pause and get drunk off these city lights
I'm all about us tonight
Ooh, I'm scared to fall in love again
Ooh, I'm scared to fall in love again
