[Verse 1]
I wanna go down with you, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna pull the trigger with you
Oh
I wanna slow dance while they're screaming
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wanna take you with me
Oh

[Chorus]
You are all that I need
And you are all I believe
Is everything fine?
'Cause you ain't gotta leave
I wanna go down, down, down, down, down with you

[Verse 1]
Yeah, she said love me when you're ready, not when you're lonely
I don't know myself, so there's no way you know me
But if I hold you down, then you better hold me
But if I call your bluff, then you better fold me
'Cause I can't risk it all for you
If you don't see that I'm all for you, oh

[Chorus]
You are all that I need
And you are all I believe
Is everything fine?
'Cause you ain't gotta leave
I wanna go down, down, down, down, down with you

[Verse 2]
Oh, back up
Why is everything going backwards?
Drinking, rolling up a couple Backwoods
Every day we argue, that's a bad look
Yeah, song in the key of hope, sing it for me
Cup full of love, drink it for me
I rather deal with oh well than what if
You got me addicted off of one hit

[Chorus]
You are all that I need
And you are all I believe
Is everything fine?
'Cause you ain't gotta leave
I wanna go down, down, down, down, down with you
