[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Oh, mmm
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I been climbin', the view's spectacular
Even if I crash, I'd rather drive than be the passenger
Slightly philosophical, I wanna die young as old as possible
As of late, I been feelin' responsible
For my family's livelihood, I think tonight we should
Celebrate the fact that I'm a star and that the likelihood
Of me blowin', in the next couple of months is definite
Anticipate me comin' like the porn stars in my messages
Speakin' of porn stars, all my exes all Latinas
Hits them like tequila when they see me in arenas, and yeah
It hasn't happened yet but trust me, y'all gon' pay for
Bein' devils in disguise as everything I prayed for
I learned a lot though from all the above
I guess God got a job at the comedy club
But fuck that, I'm buzzin' now, whole industry flockin'
'Cause I'm the people's champ and you just industry poppin', c'mon

[Chorus]
I been travelin' a lot now
Got to find the time to
Take it in and take a step back
Kick it with the family
I cannot help it that I'm focused on my vision
All the time, it just feels like it's an emergency
I tell my mama, don't you cry, I'll be back soon
You know I'm always moving with a sense of urgency

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, I swear I had a year that you can't ignore
I swear that no one's ever won, how I'm winnin' before
Pretty women like Julia Roberts come to the concerts
And scream daddy but I ain't about to adopt her
I gotta conquer and collect
Every motherfuckin' check, tryna pay a couple tuitions
Write 'em off as an expense
Let the takeover commence
If I say it, I believe it, you just dream of success
I stay awake to achieve it, it's crazy seeing
Girls I used to crush on, fuckin' to my love songs
Yeah, I'm gettin' commas but I'm 'bout to get my run on
Flights bi-coastal, everythin' paid for
That's just how it goes when you take what they wait for
Things are pickin' up, I'm just tryna find the peace
Some people shine and give it back but my shine is not a lease
This is permanently owned, if I lose it, it's on my terms
I don't wish for shit, I desire then acquire

[Chorus]
I been travelin' a lot now
Got to find the time to
Take it in and take a step back
Kick it with the family
I cannot help it that I'm focused on my vision
All the time, it just feels like it's an emergency
I tell my mama, don't you cry, I'll be back soon
You know I'm always moving with a sense of urgency

[Verse 3]
No failure is final, no success is permanent
It's madness, mom really 'bout to march like the tournament
Certain shits been fuckin' up my days and nights
Like yeah, my parents got no money so I guess I gotta pay the price
At least I have it, let me get my blessings straight
If this was last year, we'd be food stamps and Section 8
Awkward conversations with my dad he's feelin' cursed
He's askin' me for gas it's like the roles are reversed
Monitor what Russ is makin', feelin' like I'm suffocatin'
Feelin' like I need 10 shots and 2 blunts to chase it
Acceptin' what is and lettin' go of what was
Havin' faith in what could be if I just one up
Myself every time and let the chips fall where they may
I got pit stops in LA, makin' shit pop every day, yeah
People stumble on stones that I use to step on
The chips I mentioned earlier, I pick 'em up and bet on myself

[Chorus]
I been travelin' a lot now
Got to find the time to
Take it in and take a step back
Kick it with the family
I cannot help it that I'm focused on my vision
All the time, it just feels like it's an emergency
I tell my mama, don't you cry, I'll be back soon
You know I'm always moving with a sense of urgency
