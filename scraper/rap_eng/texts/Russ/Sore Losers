[Intro]
Yeah
So many sore losers keep tryna talk to me
Y'all need to focus on winning, stop focusing on me
Yeah

[Verse]
Thirteen thousand in Portugal, that's arena talk
You still on your Training Day, you Ethan Hawke
Rappers with your get rich quick scheme gimmicks
Instead of hating you should focus on your sixteenth minute
We are not side by side, ain't no split-screen image
I'ma be around forever like a Springsteen ticket
I'm just bathing in success, yeah I rinse clean with it
I put my best foot forward like a Nowitzki pivot
I got blitzkrieg critics
They ain't wastin' no time
But I ain't wastin' no money, so I pay 'em no mind
That's a lie, I be snappin'
That's my fault, I'm adjustin' to people spreadin' lies about me
Just hatin' and judging
For the sake of discussion, in the hopes of some clout
Shit's been stressful, I just need some pretty hoes with some mouth
Put my home in the South, 10K square feet
Name your favorite rappers now, let's play "where's he?"
Probably chasin' a hit, probably lost in LA
Probably paying for likes, probably paying for plays
Probably owns a Corolla, but probably rents the Aventador
Business manager furious, like "What the fuck did you spend that for?"
Fuck y'all though, I'ma keep on winnin'
I got angels all around me, y'all can keep on sinnin'
'Cause ain't no way y'all are fuckin' up my light light
I spent two million just on taxes, somethin' light light
In hindsight, I was right all along, life of a don
Writin' songs, all those hooks were a fight to get on
You gotta see it way before it happens, yes yes
I'ma be the greatest, I won't settle for next best
Got your girl in her birthday suit, that's best dressed
Plus she likes girls too like Ellen DeGeneres
First class Emirates that's how I'm flyin'
SUVs on the tarmac, that's how I'm arrivin'
Presidential treatment, ooh this life so good
White skin, they can't believe that I got friends in the hood
I know the love songs and melodies throw y'all off
Don't give a fuck about your face tats, we know y'all soft
People we know with face tats got them for a reason
You use them for the gang culture aesthetic, you reachin'
A lot of kids are poppin' xans and sippin' lean now
A lot of rappers using Instagram to teach how
A lot of kids OD'ed that you don't read 'bout
'Cause they don't follow rappers, they just follow fiends now
But I'm the bad guy for callin' it out
I come in clutch with the truth, y'all are stallin' it out
I only get in trouble when I say the truth
Which means you gettin' fed lies everyday, you fools
Do your research before you try and speak on my name
Rappers wearing CZs and leasing the chains
The beats classic, I amaze myself
I'm a boss, I'm a owner, yeah I pay myself
Fuck the capes of society, I saved myself
Even after all the millions bitch, I stayed myself
I still take my mom with me, Bugus still right here
New people think my buzz got here in a lightyear
Fuck y'all, this ain't a Toy Story
I eat Nigerian, save some moimoi for me
Yeah, lot of y'all girls I coulda hit
But I'm the type to pass the pussy to stay home and cut a hit
Never fuck a chick at her house, she got exes
I just bought a crib, I got guns, I got exits
Cameras at the entrance
Try if you want to
Bugus told me, "God forbid they get you, I got you"
I'm an idol, people treat me like Billy
Singin' and rappin' goin' platinum, people treat me like Drizzy
Take the studio with me
Set up shop in the telly
I've watched a lot of rappers talk but then they flop like Belly
There ain't shit you can tell me, you can save that shit
Fake convos before favors, I hate that shit
Yesterday turned down a 150,000
I ain't trippin' 'bout it
I get that every week like allowance
From my independent catalog
Fuck these rec league rappers tryna battle 'Bron
Stay in your lane, this is big business
Move bitch, get back like Chris Bridges
I remember only sellin' like six tickets
Now I make the girls crazy like Sid Vicious
I coulda played it different, coulda silenced all my truths
Coulda buddied up with rappers for the sake of looking cool
But it's not in me to be fake, I can't do it
I can see through it, man this game is translucent
They twist the truth for the headline drama
Clicks create traffic, traffic creates dollars
The sheep believe it, they ain't up on game yet
Smooth rides ain't as fun to watch as trainwrecks (damn)
Controversy is currency, controversy is clout
That's why my haters keep my name in their mouth
Y'all are hopeless, this is a decade of devotion
It's hard to stop my movement when I'm already in motion
This ain't luck, this is by design
I had to work in the dark for my light to shine
A lot of people are dope, they just quit too soon
A lot of rappers go broke, 'cause they got rich too soon (damn)
My confidence plus my success is just a mirror for some
It forces them to look around and see what they haven't done
That's a line for any hater, y'all are mad at yourselves
Judging every move I make, y'all distractin' yourselves
You could do this shit too if you wanted
But you would rather sit around and bitch and make comments
Oh well, suit yourself, be miserable
I'm country-hoppin' in a jet, that's the visual
I saw this coming in my hoodie with the plaid flannel
I bet on myself, yeah I had to gamble
I feel like I'm half god, half mammal
Bitch I turned my life into the Travel Channel
I'm not home, I'm in Stockholm
With heated floors and the beds with the soft foam
It's like clockwork watching sore losers poke their heads out
Every time I big myself up, they get stressed out
I'm the best out, yeah I said it
Self-made millionaire, you know what's up with the credits
I'm the best out, yeah I said it
Self-made millionaire, you know what's up with the credits

[Outro]
Bitch, yeah
