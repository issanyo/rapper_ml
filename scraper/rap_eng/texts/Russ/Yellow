[Hook: Russ]
I can see the green light comin'
I can see the red light comin'
I can see the yellow light comin'
It's yellow, yellow, hello, hello

[Verse 1: Russ]
Meditate to clear my mind
Think about my life and shit
I remember being 9
Before I had the mic and shit
Standin' on the mantelpiece
Watch it turn into a stage
Told my mom I got her
Imma' buy a place where we can stay
Right up on the beach
I'm the nicest with the beats
Turn my bedroom to a bank
I'm cashin' out on self-belief and shit
Actualizin' dreams and shit
Made it to the other side
See me on yo T.V. screen
I made it to the other side
Movin' like a you-know-what
Bosses recognizin' me
Cause I'm move a certain way
It's really not surprising me
It's really not surprising me
It's D-I-E-M-O-N
That's the dynasty

[Hook: Russ]
I can see the green light comin'
I can see the red light comin'
I can see the yellow light comin'
It's yellow, yellow, hello, hello

[Verse 2: Russ]
Say that you're the hottest out
Soundin' like a myth to me
Cause I got your latest album
That just sound like shit to me
Diemon makin' history
Check you're local TV Channel
Or the radio, DJ Haven got me in Seattle
See the truth inside of you
Found it right inside of me
When you hit that yellow light
Hit the gas like it's the green
Get the cash and buy a dream
For my family, fuck receipts
Do it for the nine year old inside of me who's tryin' me
Promise I'mma make you proud, promise you inspire me
Promise if I let you down, I promise Imma' fire me
And I got my trump slippers on
With the blunt and some liquor

[Hook: Russ]
I can see the green light comin'
I can see the red light comin'
I can see the yellow light comin'
It's yellow, yellow, hello, hello
