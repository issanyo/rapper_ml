Stop playing hard to get
I understand your pride, pride
But I want you to be my
Sunday morning and Saturday night, night
I got popping, got money and you felt that
Wasn't in your class so you held back
Now I got little clout so the mouth come easily
I'm hot, you get high off the Heat, Mike Beasley
People can't speak to me
This is Such Great Heights like Postal Service
Hoes twerking, cause I've been coastal serving
If you know, tell me who's more deserving
Real one

Tattoos, all over your body, let me ask you
Did the needle hurt you more?
Did your past dues?
They always used to laugh now I laugh too
While we're fucking
Tattoos, all over your body, let me ask you
Did the needle hurt you more?

They always used to laugh now I laugh too
While we're fucking

New entry, millionaire club
Come through, get millionaire love
Long distance, short attention span
You were teaching me too, I got lesson plans
You're popping, shit, I'm popping too
Bad break up, your ex got you popping two
I'm getting on, soon I'll be off for you
I'm on tour now, so pull up when I'm stopping through
I can fly you direct, talk in person, try to work it out
Figure out if it's worth it
You switch dude's more times than I switch states
Didn't know when I was still dropping mixtapes
Damn, I forgive you baby
Good dick and cash is what I'll give you baby
If I'm with you baby then I'm with you crazy
If I want you today, I'll continue daily

You know me and I've known you too
