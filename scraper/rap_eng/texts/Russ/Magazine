[HOOK]
You the baddest girl I ever seen
I mean better than the ones in the Magazine
It's your mind its your body it's your everything
I'm a King and I'm lookin for a Queen
I wanna go and make you my woman
I know I made mistakes with my woman
But I will change my ways for my woman
But I ain't got no woman right now

[VERSE 1]
When I saw her
She was drop dead gorgeous
All you other girls
Should drop dead and forfeit
We can go now
We can go to St. Lucia
We can vibe out and talk about the future
I can tell now girl you're far from a loser
My daddy and my mama
I might have to introduce you
Who would've known I fell so hard?
You're so fine and you still so smart and sexy

[HOOK]
You the baddest girl I ever seen
I mean better than the ones in the Magazine
It's your mind its your body it's your everything
I'm a King and I'm lookin for a Queen
I wanna go and make you my woman
I know I made mistakes with my woman
But I will change my ways for my woman
But I ain't got no woman right now

[VERSE 2]
She got a glow like a floatin star
She let me pull her G string when there's no guitar
You hold me down I appreciate your conversation
Life's beens complicated baby
I been contemplating a lot of things on my mind
And you got the patience
To talk to me I appreciate you always waitin
For me to get my mind right
I know be trippin'
You nothin like these other women
Baby you so different
I can't believe my eyes

[HOOK]
You the baddest girl I ever seen
I mean better than the ones in the Magazine
It's your mind its your body it's your everything
I'm a King and I'm lookin for a Queen
I wanna go and make you my woman
I know I made mistakes with my woman
But I will change my ways for my woman
But I ain't got no woman right now

[BRIDGE]
Once I'm going I can't get off it
I love how it sound when she's talking
Voice like velvet shawty is an angel
I only wanna vibe

[HOOK]
You the baddest girl I ever seen
I mean better than the ones in the Magazine
It's your mind its your body it's your everything
I'm a King and I'm lookin for a Queen
I wanna go and make you my woman
I know I made mistakes with my woman
But I will change my ways for my woman
But I ain't got no woman right now
