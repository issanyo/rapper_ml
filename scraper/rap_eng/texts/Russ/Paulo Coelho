[Verse: Russ]
Yeah, woah, we turn up fast then we go slow
When I see through you that's when I go ghost
Like the car that I'll be driving
I'm 'bout to be a star, are you riding?
So tell me that you don't need the shows
Tell me that you don't need the drank
Tell me that you don't need to smoke
Tell me that you don't need the pain

[Hook: Russ]
Ooo girl
You know you make me wanna'...
Ooo girl
I think I'm gonna' do it
Yeah do it
Ooh-ooh-oohh

[Outro: Russ]
Yeah, tap into your mind
Tap into your soul
Tap until you tap out
Tap to let me know
Tap into your mind
Tap into your soul
Tap until you tap out
Tap to let me know
