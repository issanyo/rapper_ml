[Hook: Russ]
Oh, everybody knows
That nobody really knows
Yeah everybody knows

[Verse 1: Russ]
I walked right through your line of fire
Got hit by your bullets
Looking at your trigger finger
Hoping you don't pull it
But you did
So it is, what it is
I guess I'm wounded
But fuck that shit
Cause you lost out, I'm winning
Fuck you doing?
I got hits that deserve to be heard where the Knicks play
Like Patrick Ewing
And yeah I'm on probation
But I found the truth in this gin and juice
And I believe in the movement
I had to cut you off
You were getting too heavy
And I'm already holding the world
And I'm the one and I'm feeling too ready

[Hook: Russ]
Oh, everybody knows
That nobody really knows
Yeah everybody knows

[Verse 2: Russ]
Yeah, idols popping off my walls
It's feeling like it's 3D
And I'm at home with my mom
Watching myself on the TV
Yeah and 'cause of what my dad went through
I gotta' do right
So many sirens have turned into silence
I just offer you life
There's something you should know

[Hook: Russ]
Oh, everybody knows
That nobody really knows
Yeah everybody knows
Oh, everybody knows
That nobody really knows
Yeah everybody knows

[Outro: The Beatles]
She's got the devil in her heart
