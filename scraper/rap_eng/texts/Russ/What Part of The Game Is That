Crossin boundaries
What part of the game is that
Gettin cheated on
What part of the game is that
No money
What part of the game is that
I see you settlin
What part of the game is that
For the last 6 years
I been on the same shit
Same crib same studio
Got the same chick
Same script same movie roll
Tom Hanks shit
Drank this Don Julio
I'm fuckin faded

[VERSE 1]
If I only know one thing
Good gon come to the patient
Always knew I'd run the game
Makin songs in my basement
Met a couple good people
Only good for conversation
Had a couple good meetings
Only good for confirmation
Know I'm always down to do it
No I never get complacent
Wakin up to the basics is enough motivation
Got my girl check
I'm thorough check
My niggas down to take over the world
Yes
Got my girl check
I'm thorough check
My niggas down to take over the world
Yes
Half of yall
Yall niggas went ghost
The other half just be doin the most

[VERSE 2]
6 years later man
I finally graduated
Black man with a degree
Finally made it
And I celebrate daily cuz I'm neva jaded
DIEMON gang be the name
We dun elevated
DIEMON rang DIEMON chains
And we still stainless
Still got Russ on the beats and they still bangin
Even though this shit is dope
What I do is not in vein
I just be cuttin people off when they be talkin insane
Dream big so the small minded wanna tame us
Haters might well as speak another fuckin language
Now I'm entertainin gettin world famous
Look directly in the mirror I just gotta thank him
