[Intro]
Yeah, everybody got a breakin' point
Yeah, na na na na

[Verse 1]
I move with P. Stones and Igbos
For any rappers tryna play the hero
For any peasant tryna play Deebo
On some tough guy shit, you not a tough guy, bitch
You mad 'cause the girl you wanna fuck sucked my dick
You were a high school loser, now a bitter adult
I handle your karma myself, that's a quicker result
Raisin' money to kill me 'cause y'all be poppin' the pills
Take the money, save the money for your hospital bills, bitch
They think it's sweet because my skin tone
Little bitch, I been known, people that extend beyond my zipcode
Godby Road, Old National highway
Spelled it out for out-of-towners comin' at me sideways
Old Nat (Old Nat), I can't want for them to get you
Y'all stalkers studied up on me, can't wait for them to test you
Old Nat (Old Nat), I'm unassumin' so you're unprepared
I might make them film it, show the world you're fuckin' scared

[Chorus]
They want me to shut the fuck up, fuck that
They want my talent, my nuts tucked, fuck that
They're tryna get me to hate me, fuck that
'Cause y'all can't ever ever play me, fuck that
Stop playin' with me, playin' with me
Somebody gon' end up hurt
Stop playin' with me, playin' with me
I promise I see every word

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I got big and your bitch is the proof
I got bigger when the media twisted the truth
These insecure grown men I've never met, y'all don't have a cause
If people like me don't exist, y'all don't have a job
You a bitch, you probably got fucked in the pen
You still a bitch, you just gossip with a pen
Fuck the clickbait, political bitch-made journalists
Most of y’all are pussy, smell like fishbait
I dictate my hours, how 'bout you?
I made four million in four minutes bitch, how 'bout you?
Like a Final Four moment that I'll never forget
I wore a fuckin' T-shirt and then I cut through the net
I win, we'll never meet, you're not rich enough bitch
All your disses don't reach, you're not big enough bitch
Y'all be dissin' for the clout, that's how poppin' I am
One phone call, this phone is like a Glock in my hand

[Chorus]
They want me to shut the fuck up, fuck that
They want my talent, my nuts tucked, fuck that
They're tryna get me to hate me, fuck that
'Cause y'all can't ever ever play me, fuck that
Stop playin' with me, playin' with me
Somebody gon' end up hurt
Stop playin' with me, playin' with me
I promise I see every word

[Verse 3]
Yeah, this whole nation is so shaken by the approach taken
My soul is exposed naked, I’m blatant, I'm so brazen
That's why I'm the most hated, runnin' on low patience
I'm road pavin', screamin' truth until my throat's achin'
No chasin', after shows hoes waitin'
Y'all careers keep failin', study mine, start note takin'
Carvin' my name in the game in bold facin'
Nowadays, a hundred thousand dollars feels like no payment
So jaded, real gold, I used to wear gold-plated
That's when I was located in my come-up broke phases
I'm on a new chapter, turnin' back to those pages
It's hard when you're so famous, I can't be in both places
Jugglin' both stages, the most that I can do is show traces
All I ask for in return is just go where the growth takes us
I propose a toast to those who don't condone fake shit
Game is full of squares, I'm just here to reshape it
Mixin' up my message, stop trying to rephrase it
Listen to the truth, stop trying to translate it
This is coming from a winner, trust me when I say it
You'll never be a main act if you can't maintain it
And to the people threatenin', makin' bold statements
I got people that love the sounds of fists flyin' and bones breakin'
Your green room's just a box, they gon' catch you, no fakin'
They're the kings of fuckin' people up in small enclosed spaces

[Chorus]
Stop playin' with me, playin' with me
Somebody gon' end up hurt
Stop playin' with me, playin' with me
I promise I see every word
They want me to shut the fuck up, fuck that
They want my talent, my nuts tucked, fuck that
They're tryna get me to hate me, fuck that
'Cause y'all can't ever ever play me, fuck that

[Outro]
