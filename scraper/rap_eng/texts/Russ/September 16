[Chorus]
I don't know why we even tried this in the first place
But it all comes back to love
Yeah, it all comes back to love (na, na, na)
I been trying to do my best in the worst way
'Cause it all comes back to love
Yeah, it all comes back to love (na, na, na)

[Verse 1]
Met back in our twenties
Ex-wife wanted money
You still wanted me back then but now you do not love me
No affection, no respect
It's been too long since a check came my way
Not the same ever since my father's death
No excuses, yeah I know
I been trying, I been trying
June I'm fine, kids I'm fine
I been lying, I been lying
So much pressure, I can't sleep
Everything about me aching
It's so hard to accept my kid bringing home the bacon
I'm at fault, I'm a loser, best believe I've heard it all
From the girl of my dreams that I married in the fall
And I get it, your resentment, yeah it's justified
But I've had enough of arguing, I've had enough of crying
I know that you're mad but you were mad when I was paid too
I'm feeling helpless, I just hope our love saves you
It's been over twenty years, recognize our blessings
Even though that we can barely coexist for more than twenty seconds, damn

[Chorus]
I don't know why we even tried this in the first place
But it all comes back to love
Yeah, it all comes back to love (na, na, na)
I been trying to do my best in the worst way
'Cause it all comes back to love
Yeah, it all comes back to love (na, na, na)

[Verse 2]
I love you Jim, the way you grin, the way you make me laugh
The way you helped me raise three angels, wouldn't take it back
I think you're a genius, that's why I be stressing you
CEO, CEO, I expect nothing less from you
That's a compliment, I know that I should show more
Gratitude for you, I know my attitude's been so poor
But so have we but this is deeper than a bank account
I know that I got pent up shit, I know I need to work it out
Russell takes me traveling, he just does our balancing
He knows that you're strong meanwhile he knows that I'm unraveling
He's not taking sides, trust me he says that you're right
He just tryna help us both, he don't wanna see us fight
It rained when we got married and you know I loved the sun
I know I blamed you for things outta your control
But you're the one that I love
Damn, that I love (I'm sorry, I love you)

[Chorus]
I don't know why we even tried this in the first place
But it all comes back to love
Yeah, it all comes back to love (na na na)
I been trying to do my best in the worst way
'Cause it all comes back to love
Yeah, it all comes back to love (na na na)

[Outro]
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
