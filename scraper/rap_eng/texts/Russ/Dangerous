[Intro]
Yeah, come on

[Chorus]
I ain't tryin' to hang with you (oh oh oh)
I can tell you dangerous (oh oh oh)
Shit just ain't the same with you (oh oh oh)
I can tell you dangerous (yeah yeah yeah)
I ain't tryin' to hang with you (oh oh oh)
I can tell you dangerous (oh oh oh)
Shit just ain't the same with you (oh oh oh)
I can tell you dangerous (yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse 1]
I know you too well
Check myself, I don't need you
But it's getting late, I'm awake, I might see you
I'm feeling myself, comfortable in my Adidas
I don't blame myself, uh oh
This tequila got me feeling froggy, I might leap now
I just need a little TLC so I might creep now
Hold up let me catch myself this happens every week now
Somebody come take my phone

[Chorus]
I ain't tryin' to hang with you (oh oh oh)
I can tell you dangerous (oh oh oh)
Shit just ain't the same with you (oh oh oh)
I can tell you dangerous (yeah yeah yeah)
I ain't tryin' to hang with you (oh oh oh)
I can tell you dangerous (oh oh oh)
Shit just ain't the same with you (oh oh oh)
I can tell you dangerous (yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse 2]
We done this before, this back and forth is gettin' old
I hope you understand the reason I can't see you anymore
I got a life I gotta live, you got one too, it's time to quit
I cannot fall back into my old ways
This is hard to hear, I know, we had our run but now it's over
We were drunk off arguments and texts but now we're fuckin' sober
This is far from something healthy, I can help you if you help me
We just gotta go our separate ways

[Chorus]
I ain't tryin' to hang with you (oh oh oh)
I can tell you dangerous (oh oh oh)
Shit just ain't the same with you (oh oh oh)
I can tell you dangerous (yeah yeah yeah)
I ain't tryin' to hang with you (oh oh oh)
I can tell you dangerous (oh oh oh)
Shit just ain't the same with you (oh oh oh)
I can tell you dangerous (yeah yeah yeah)
