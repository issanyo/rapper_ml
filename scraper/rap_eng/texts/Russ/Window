Yeah
You gonna have to smoke some of this one
Be free

Yeah, okay
I don't want to wake up from the sight of a red light
Just green, and the mights on my headlights
Gotta do it because I live to be dead and I sit til I get right, trips on the jet mic
Climb into a place where I can't get, jet it
Penthouse, palm trees, long time with it
Had a couple dreams and I motherfuckin' admit it
And you motherfuckin' haters livin on givin' faith in it
With a face full of smoke, chased what I hoped, stakes so high I don"t wanna be broke
Plates on mine
I don't wanna waste time
So I gave my life for the songs I wrote
And I saved my mind for the bongs i smoke
It's my right to be wrong
I float, I float, I float
It's my right to be wrong so cope

Can't live it right
Just watch your life
I'm at my window
This world's so cold
It's gettin' old
I'm tryna win though
They throwin stones up at my throne
They ain't gettin in though
This is what I'm in for now
But they're just going down, down, down, down, down (But they just goin')
They just goin down, down, down, down, down

Uh
Make savers, don't make paper
I'm busy with the biss, I'ma play later
Can't sit around, just watch em' at a window
Gotta get it so I standin like the winds blow
Gotta get it, this floors forbidden and I'm so warm with it
Matter afact it's so hot, gimme all your homies got
And it just dont stop and I'm just gonna rock
Just to piss you off
You just mad
You hustle knockin' yo shit
Whack in that hell problem
I make cool hits
You make bullshit
Ive got a pool bitch
And you got nada
I hit the strip in that cool whip
You ask how good this could get
Is this how life is fully lived
If not then I'm just not equipped

Can't live it right
Just watch your life
I'm at my window
This world's so cold
It's gettin old
I'm tryna win though
They throwin stones up at my throne
They ain't gettin in though
This is what I'm in for now
But they're just going down, down, down, down, down (But they just goin')
They just goin down, down, down, down, down

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Night live fights like swords in my wind pipe
Knobs in my back so I'm sortin and im in flight
Runnin from the devil and I come another level
To reddle up, pedal fast through the past
All my sins like
"Fuck that, blowin raps to the head band
One track, come back with a bread stand
Never gonna quit it ever til I can't breath
Bitch fuck a plan b, you dont understand me

Many motherfuckers wouldn't give me a chance
But many motherfuckers talkin shit in advance
I sat in stands then got in a gang
You plan, take a chance
And I got the fame
But fuck fame, fuck money
I gotta keep it real I got enough money
But I gotta get it right, get in sight, on the mic and, set fire through the wire when i write
And I gotta keep it vertical, wills all surgical, world rode wide
Most guys never heard of you
To say you boys like a hot plate
I smell good and I got taste
I felt broke, so I got paid
I went hell broke, it was God's gates
That bounced me back in God's race
So I run these tracks at God's pace

Can't live it right
Just watch your life
I'm at my window
This world's so cold
It's gettin old
I'm tryna win though
They throwin stones up at my throne
They ain't gettin in though
This is what I'm in for now
But they're just going down, down, down, down, down (But they just goin')
They just goin down, down, down, down, down (But they just goin')
