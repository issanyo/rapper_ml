[HOOK]
I'm tryna get on
I'm tryna get on
So I can be out here baby
Outta here baby

[VERSE 1]
Baby I been broke
I been on my last cent
Investing in myself now
Thats a couple racks spent
Livin in this small space
Way too many roaches
Livin in the studio
All I know is focus
With my girl for 7 years
All we did was grow apart
I was tryna flood the game
Til she left on Noah's Ark
I was too in
Talkin too deep
Need like two M's in like 2 weeks

[HOOK]
I'm tryna get on
I'm tryna get on
So I can be out here baby
Outta here baby

[VERSE 2]
All these bills pilling up
I been actin wild as fuck
My dad had two lifes
My dad had two wifes
Now my apartment got no fuckin space now
Now my old Volvo 'bout to fuckin break down
Seein Russ blow I know what it really takes now
I know that its real and its something I can take down

[HOOK]
I'm tryna get on
I'm tryna get on
So I can be out here baby
Outta here baby
