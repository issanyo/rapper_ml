[Intro: Russ]
Yeah
Sometimes I feel like this
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Russ]
Sometimes I feel like this
Sometimes I feel like that
Sometimes I'm feeling dark
But then I'm light
But then I'm back
Sometimes I feel like spazzin'
Yelling out that I'm the one
Cause I been mapping this out
Since before I knew I was the one
Sometimes I feel like shaking people
Just to get through to them
But they're old, dumb and confused
Man, this ain't nothing new to them
Still I got some news for them
Hello Mr. Landlord
Russ is here, I'm moving in
This is just the mood I'm in
Killing shit while I'm feeling it
Then I black out
Wake up with a Dominican
And dip out while she passed out
Looking for the credit for the hat
Telling her I maxed out
Bitch I'm tryna' rob this whole game
Ski mask out

[Refrain: Russ]
Now I don't think that you should fuck with me
Not until I atleast fuck with you

[Verse 2: Russ]
Dreams and aspirations growing
Living in my head
Like a mu'fuckin' tumor
If I don't remove them then I'm dead
Imma' get this shit popping
If not, my list popping
In the meantime
I bought my sister a new wrist watch
Next comes the Range
Then a house in the sand
Hello Mr. Mirror
I'm the mutha' fuckin' man
Damn
