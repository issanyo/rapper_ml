Ok, this cup in my hand got me loose
And this blunt's in demand while I'm standing in the booth
I'm just doing what I want, do you feel me?
Doing what I want, it's the real me

Got a little bit of liquor and a bag full of weed
Dance with my liver as I capture the beat
Drink slow, bring hoes, indoor
Windows down, when I wanna roll around on the street
That I blew upon, grew upon, blew upon, stop
Let me get a little bit of henny on the rock
So smooth, don't you wanna try what I've got
One more shot I'ma fly till I drop

Hey I'm going up and I'm talking up, please don't hold me down
Keep rolling up, don't slow me up, this is going down
Whoa, light me up and let's hide out
Hide me up but don't tie me up, just ...and let's ride out like whoa
To get you high up, into the fire higher place
Into the sky up, into the fire fly away
To get you high up, into the fire higher place
Into the sky up, into the fire fly away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I feel alright, alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I feel alright, alright
Hey I'm going up and I'm talking up, please don't hold me down
Keep rolling up, don't slow me up, this is going down
Whoa, light me up and let's hide out
Hide me up but don't tie me up, just ...and let's ride out like whoa, ok let's go

Doing what I want, it's the real me

I'm ...going up, while you steady going down
And I'm smoking blunts while I'm sipping on this brown
And everywhere I go I'm getting higher than you know
Every time I show up, I'm just flier than before

So great with my dutch though
Your shit...hoe
Don't get shit mixed up, better keep your bitch cuffed
By the time I ... though
And she can get a head of that
We at vip, you tryna get her back
But she leave with me, I'll take a hit of that
And you can pick her ass up, where I ...
