[Intro: Russ]
Ooooo
Take me down
Take me down
Oh yeaah

[Interlude: Russ]
Roll me some, just to get me right
Pour me some, just to get me right
Run around the country like a boss do
Flyin' around the world like a diplomat
Told that bitch shoulda' treat me right
Hollywood hills yeah I seen these heights
Run around the country like a boss do
Flyin' around the world like a diplomat

[Verse 1: Russ]
I could probably catch you with your knees down
Have you looking at me like you knew it
Getting way too caught up in these towns
Tell me that ya' not that stupid (Ooooo)
Tell me that ya' not that stupid (Ooooo)
Tell me that ya' not that stupid

[Hook x4: Russ]
Fuck with me, you know you got it good

[Verse 2: Russ]
Killers on my phone, next to my ma'
Macivan on the phone said it's time to put on
Boutta' pull up on him at the D mall
But I weigh the ups and downs like a seesaw

[Sample: Macivan]
Life out the trap nigga wanna' come get it I got it
Life out the trap nigga wanna' come get it I got it

[Hook x4: Russ]
Fuck with me, you know you got it good

[Verse 3: Russ]
Master in my craft living like a bachelor in the hat
So I can get to the D mall with a compound and a  stash
Duffle bags full of over night clothes
For these over night shows
Back in Atlanta fucking with over night hoes
But it's time to branch out I need that outta' state commission
Its more money when you leave you know that outta' state tuition
Intuition that's the rhythm that I'm grooving with
Tell me what's your energy show me what you moving with
I ain't new to this,  don't be stupid bitch

[Hook x8: Russ]
Fuck with me, you know you got it good
