[Intro]
Yeah
Out here chasing emotions, baby, you can't blame us
And you definitely can't contain us

[Verse 1]
Ok, it's Hennessy, I'm Baileys for my ennemies
Hey ladies, my remedy is memories and bottles in mercedes
But, honestly, my policy has changed: I'm trying to save me
And if you hate me, you still gonna play me
So back the fuck up, 'cause your words don't mean a damn thing
Still, I'm just romantic, guess it's just a man thing
I keep dancing as the Devil stepping on my toes
Guess it's how the lesson goes, blessing me while stressing hoes
But either way, the [?] keep making beats
Yeah, I put my voice on them so I don't have to face defeat
And even if I do, at least, I took the last shot
Now, I'm on my last shot
Bailey is my Mascot
She's right beside me, singing lightly in this glass box
Me and her just riding with the Devil 'til the last top
'til the last top
Me and her just riding until the fucking last top

[Chorus]
This night ain't go last
This life is way too fast
Gotta slow, girl, but the Devil's on my ass
So I'm not looking for the gas right now
This night ain't go last
This life is way too fast
Gotta slow, girl, but the Devil's on my ass
So I'm not looking for the gas right now

[Verse 2]
Yo, I swear to God, I'm about to black out
Had my brother decay sitting in a cell and living Hell, hoping that he tox out
But now, he's back out
Fuck the bitch that put him there
She was mad that he was making moves and thought he wouldn't dare
Did to [?] live arrest
Talked to Bailey, had to pass
I'm [?] bitches trying best
Young and trying to get his cash
Guess not, 'cause next step was the end part
Gone 'til November who I were, wah, went God

[Chorus]
This night ain't go last
This life is way too fast
Gotta slow, girl, but the Devil's on my ass
So I'm not looking for the gas right now
This night ain't go last
This life is way too fast
Gotta slow, girl, but the Devil's on my ass
So I'm not looking for the gas right now

[Bridge]
This night ain't go last
This life is way too fast
Gotta slow, girl, but the Devil's on my ass
So I'm not looking for the gas right now

[Verse 3]
Han, hey Gianna, how you doin', pretty girl?
The greatest little sister in this pretty ugly world
You're a princess, I'm a witness
You inviting me the moment 'til I said that I won't miss it
But I know I will, I'm always gone
You're always right, I'm always wrong
'Cause knowing me I'm blowing tree, I'm always making songs
The faith is gone, the wait is on but I'm gonna come back
With lavish luxuries, a palace off for one track
I'm nineteen, by twenty, I'm gonna have some money
Deck you out in Gucci, Louis, I just keep [?]
Just stay away, the Devil's everywhere you go
But God is on your side so go where you go
I love you

[Chorus] x2
This night ain't go last
This life is way too fast
Gotta slow, girl, but the Devil's on my ass
So I'm not looking for the gas right now
This night ain't go last
This life is way too fast
Gotta slow, girl, but the Devil's on my ass
So I'm not looking for the gas right now
