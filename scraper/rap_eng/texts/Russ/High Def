[Verse 1: Russ]
It's that super slow mo music
For those nights that you lose it
Where you might become clueless
Cause your life might seem useless
So you keep on chuggin' down that bottle of Henny
And you keep on ridin' round 'til that bottle is empty
Okay it's Grey Goose
Fake druce
Lookin' for a savior, Jesus
Save who, save me
I've been getting fucked up lately
I don't wanna slow down
Wanna go fast
It's my town
This my cash
Sip this brown
Kiss my ass
This my sound
Tip my glass

[Hook x2: Russ]
We fly high, if you comin' let me know
If not you gotta' go
Just watch us as we blow
See my life, keep on runnin' towards the show
The lights won't let me go
Just watch us as we blow

[Verse 2: Bugus]
Okay I see so many lights I think I'm blinded (blinded)
I think I lost my mind cause I can't find it
Two chiefers in my two seater
New buddha that's new reefer
I got new heaters
Couple new speakers
And a drop-top crook that's new features
I'm ridin' round with your bitch
Your hoe know to keep my blunt lit
And she blow my bone while I blow my zone
By the end of the night I'm goin' home alone
Cause I'm on my own
Idon't know y'all
I did it on my own
I don't owe y'all
I smoke back to back
I go track to track
Until there's platinum plaques on my goal wall
Bugus

[Hook x2: Russ]
We fly high, if you comin' let me know
If not you gotta' go
Just watch us as we blow
See high life, keep on runnin' towards the show
The lights won't let me go
Just watch us as we blow

[Verse 3: Jalil]
Couple shots with the herb
Got my brain in a blur
Where the pain in you girl?
Talk to me now
Do you wanna' be heard?
But little time for that
Earn this cash
Get your money back
Remember that time we were in the 'Lac?
We were fucked up but you handled that
You asked me can I handle it
While we sat and smoked this spliff
Call me up and we took the whip
Told you that it was it
I'm a miracle memory
Lyrical felony
Now in the industry
How did you get to me?
I don't care
I will be rapper of the century
You will remember me
Fuck all my enemies

[Hook x2: Russ]
We fly high, if you comin' let me know
If not you gotta' go
Just watch us as we blow
See high life, keep on runnin' towards the show
The lights won't let me go
Just watch us as we blow

[Refrain x2: Bugus]
We all get high
Cause we all get low
Do you wanna drink it down?
Or do you wanna' take it slow?
Percoces, blue pills
Purple trees, too trill
I don't do pills cause I'm too real
But I know, I know how you feel

[Verse 4: Dartlin]
I'm fucked up
Sleepin' with ya bitch
Blunt in one hand
I'm just sittin' in the whip
Phantom in that phantom lit
Like glancin' I bet she gon' strip
I hit six blunts
I don't hit bunts
I hit home runs
We got next up
I'm so on, so gone, so numb, so drunk
I got five flows, one song
Four bowls, all strong
Three bitches with me
Two back seats
Only one get poked on
Call my rose a mobile home
You don't know how it feels
Shit every time I leave the house
I hop in half a mil'

[Hook x2: Russ]
We fly high, if you comin' let me know
If not you gotta' go
Just watch us as we blow
See high life, keep on runnin' towards the show
The lights won't let me go
Just watch us as we blow
