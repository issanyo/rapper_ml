[Hook]
Windmill, windmill why so slow?
First we get high then we get low
The quicker you turn, the faster I go
I just want to know

Move a little bit
Show me you can move a little bit
I really, really want you

[Verse: 1]
I used to run a race against a ghost, until I stopped
I used to run a race against myself, I always lost
And I always had to watch, but now I'm tryna keep it simple
Never felt the love like I won that winbow
Dawn of the shit, you're a pawn of this shit
I don't really care about you, carry on with your shit
We need bond in this bitch, gettin' on in this bitch
My sister growin' up too fast, bonds gettin' lit, shit

[Hook]
Windmill, windmill why so slow?
First we get high then we get low
The quicker you turn, the faster I go
I just want to know

[Verse: 2]
I swear you came around too often
I thought you were off him
And I think I just fell, and I'm lost then
Now you just tryna play with me
What the fuck kinda game is this?
What the fuck kinda game is this?
One, two, three, four
Show me that you want more

[Hook x2]
Windmill, windmill why so slow?
First we get high then we get low
The quicker you turn, the faster I go
I just want to know

[Outro]
Out here livin', out here breathin'
No cuts on my wrists, I got my freedom
I can just [?]
Just live, live, live
'Cause its boss conversation with my dad sippin' tequila
Talkin 'bout life, it doesn't get much realaaah'
