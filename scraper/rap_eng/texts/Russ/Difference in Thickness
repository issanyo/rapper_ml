[Verse 1]
Rihanna on the stereo, dancing like some crazy bitch
Yes I got no purpose in my life than eating fucking crisp
Advertising music, music on my ass
Music on her ass, ass so flat
But I hate when niggas think that they ass so fat
Fuck you talking bout, nigga you ain’t know shit
Ass is fine, when it’s motherfucking thick
Shit and thickness matters in the diameters of the shit
How you gonna say that taylor swift is fucking thick
Then you gonna say that Kylie Jenner’s fucking thick
There’s a ratio that you not =understanding
Plus fat isn’t thick, there’s a difference in the damn thing
For example Britney was a fat bitch
Now look at her, she’s now a milf bitch
Yh she thick, now you think before you talk
And never say that someone who ain’t is thick fucking hot

[Hook] (x2)
Cuz there’s a difference in the thickness (x2)
So don’t you dear say some dumb shit
Cuz I’ll beat you fucking up

[Verse 2]
Hate when white niggas clearly don’t know fucking ass
Shut the fuck up, get your motherfucking cash
While i’m sitting in my mom room, damn studying
Porn, jacking of too ebony and then some other shit
You don’t know the ‘mount of time I spent on research
You out there smoking weed, i’m out there studying bums
So if you claiming thickness that’s not there
Then I’m gonna slit your fucking wrist you fucking queer

[Hook] (x2)
Cuz there’s a difference in the thickness (x2)
So don’t dear say some dumb shit
Cuz I’ll beat you fucking up
