[Intro]
Yeah, this that shit for your two seater when you got that bad bitch right beside you
Kna' I'm sayin'
It's DIEMON kna' I'm sayin'
My nigga Russ kna' I'm sayin'
He killin' the beats kna' I'm sayin'
The hooks, the verses, all that
My nigga Dartlin
My nigga Jalil nigga
That nigga Bugus on their too kna' I'm sayin'
Came through, held it down, ya kna' I'm sayin'
Brought some L's too

[Verse 1: Russ]
Uh, ok it started back in high school
Wasn't smoking weed
Cause all my beats would get me high fool
And it's the same now, the weed just elevates it
Puts me in a spaceship
Man this kush has got me faceless
Anyways, I made a choice to find my passion
Voiced it into action
I was poised but never passive
I went after it and then I mastered it
But Imma' play until my name is in the Raptors bitch
Cause I'm a prodigy
You ought to be
Astonished at my odyssey
Made my own policy
I don't need apologies
I just need a pile of cheese
So I can take a breather
Yeah got this pile of weed
I still my need some reefer
So roll it up, roll it up
Almost there, tok it up
Stay away from hoes tryna hold you down to hold you up
Yeah you get that?
I said stay away from hoes tryna hold you down to hold you up

[Hook x2: Russ]
I don't wanna' let this feeling go
The sky is the limit cause the ceilings low
Imma' be a star that's real I know

[Verse 2: Russ]
I'm feeling like it's go time
I'm nineteen it's show time
I might scream
If your lines
Get my cream
I'll go find a pipe dream
Cause I don't really think you're fucking with me
I'm talking to the whole world you ain't fucking with me
So sit tight, make sure you got your grip right
Hold on to your spot cause the flop flops this night
It flips like
Money in my hand you a dumby cause you can be
I think it's funny get fucked like a Plan B
Cause if you can't see that Imma' be the greatest
You need to press play on the whole DIEMON playlist
Like damn, sit back and smoke a blunt
I made 60 beats in the past 3 months
So I don't give a fuck
I work hard to be cocky
You gonna' have to work twice as hard just to stop me
But even at that, I'll be feeling myself
Cause the money I make, yeah I did it myself bitch

[Hook x2: Russ]
I don't wanna' let this feeling go
The sky is the limit cause the ceilings low
Imma' be a star that's real I know

[Verse 3: Russ]
Uh, no matter what Imma' be rich forever
So I might as well help a couple birds find a feather
Then proceed to go
Down the easy road
Cause in the past I would pass on my speaking roll
But now I'm acting in my own play
Racking up my own plays
Laughing cause rapping like
What happened to the old days
But fuck my old ways
I'm sippin' on some gochay
And watchin' haters from my class pack the whole place out
It's gold plates now on the ride shit
Fly in the sky 'til you die from that high shit
And yeah I buy shit for all the times I couldn't
I'm young, rich and reckless so I'm doing what I shouldn't, bitch

[Hook x2: Russ]
I don't wanna' let this feeling go
The sky is the limit cause the ceilings low
Imma' be a star that's real I know

[Outro x2: Russ]
I don't wanna' let this feeling go
The sky is the limit cause the ceilings low
Imma' be a star that's real I know
