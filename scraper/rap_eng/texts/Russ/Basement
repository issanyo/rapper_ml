[Intro: Russ]
Yeah
Mm, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Russ]
Love me like I'm still in the basement (yeah)
Love me like I still haven't made it (yeah yeah)
Who are you if you give up? (yeah yeah)
What's real love without slip ups? (hey)

[Verse 1: Russ]
I been drinkin' 'til I can't see any red flags
(I ignored your faults)
'Nother couple shots I'm probably gonna text back
(I ignored your faults)
These other women, something's missin'
When I fuck 'em, barely touch 'em
When I fuck you, we be kissin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I
(I ignored your faults)

[Chorus: Russ]
Love me like I'm still in the basement (yeah)
Love me like I still haven't made it (yeah yeah)
Who are you if you give up? (yeah yeah)
What's real love without slip ups? (hey)

[Verse 2: Jessie Reyez]
Love me like your momma doesn't hate me
I ignored your faults
Ain't you say all your friends say that they rate me?
But I ignored your faults
And now these new ones I ain't used to
They be tryna do what you do but they missin'
'Cause they shit ain't  LOE
I heard your momma talkin' like she blames me
But you know this is your fault

[Bridge: Russ & Jesse Reyez]
Just tryna get you closer
Yeah fuck you and your closure
I ignored your faults
I tell you to come over
Don't care that I'm not sober
Just ignore my faults

[Chorus: Russ]
Love me like I'm still in the basement (yeah)
Love me like I still haven't made it (yeah yeah)
Who are you if you give up? (yeah yeah)
What's real love without slip ups? (hey)

[Outro: Russ & Jesse Reyez]
Just tryna get you closer
Yeah fuck you and your closure
So I ignored your faults
I tell you to come over
Don't care that I'm not sober
Just ignore my faults
