Shoulda followed my gut
That's what I get, I should have known
Now I'm all fucked up
And I can only blame myself
Cause I know way better than that
And I can do way better than that
I know way way better
Im'a go way better than that, I promise

One second I'm a favourite, then I'm most hated
Swear she switch moods faster than my playlist
Swear to god I find it so amazing how a person could switch
Drop that bottle, girl, you drink like a fish
See, I know what your problem is
You forgot where your bottom is
Fuck your name, Im'a call you Miss Alcoholic's Anonymous
Plus you ain't goin' where I'm goin', I can't go where you need
Movin on, you ain't growing my seed

Shoulda followed my gut
That's what I get, I should have known
Now I'm all fucked up
And I can only blame myself
Cause I know way better than that
And I can do way better than that
I know way way better
Im'a go way better than that, I promise

Something told me that that fake as nigga wasn't my homie
But you know me, I give the benefit of the doubt to niggas that know me
Fall back when I start to see signs of betrayal
Then the plan never works, one big fail
You a snake, you a serpent, devil form in mankind
You don't know how to do shit but waste my goddamn time
Smoking blunts cause a nigga got a lot on my mind
But I reach the same thought every time

Shoulda followed my gut
That's what I get, I should have known
Now I'm all fucked up
And I can only blame myself
Cause I know way better than that
And I can do way better than that
I know way way better
Im'a go way better than that, I promise

Why do we second guess
Why do we love the stress
Why do we ask for advice when we know it best
You see, it's human nature
You see, it's something major
It's always hard when you need someone to validate ya
Never knew how this argument would get
When she swear she always the opposite of left
I be cool, I just hope this isn't as good as it gets
Guess I gotta learn to live with regrets

Shoulda followed my gut
That's what I get, I should have known
Now I'm all fucked up
And I can only blame myself
Cause I know way better than that
And I can do way better than that
I know way way better
Im'a go way better than that, I promise
