[Chorus]
Yeah
Maybe it's just not our time (our time)
You got your life, I got mine (I got mine)
You're too far away, let's be real (let's be real)
To get too attached, let's be real (let's be real)
But baby on the other hand
We be kicking it, can't find nothing wrong with you
You stay up with me, help me with a song or two
Your momma loves me and I think my momma loves you too (oh-ooh, oh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
I love you dearly, love it when you're near me
Love how you don't care I make weekly what they make yearly
Yes, I love your accent, I love your compassion
Plus you singing sweetly
Then on the flip side, barely sent an invite
But that's all it took, you're on a plane, I'm in your insides
Talkin' to my homies, I can't be the only
This can't be her first time

[Chorus]
Maybe it's just not our time (our time)
You got your life, I got mine (I got mine)
You're too far away, let's be real (let's be real)
To get too attached, let's be real (let's be real)
But baby on the other hand
We be kicking it, can't find nothing wrong with you
You stay up with me, help me with a song or two
Your momma loves me and I think my momma loves you too (oh-ooh, oh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I can't tell, do I miss you enough to drink?
Or did I drink enough to miss you? So in love, I'm scared to blink
God forbid I miss a moment with you, we sharing the bed
Taking leaps of faith of love together, we sharing the ledge
And around that time my trust issues be kickin' in
I swear Latina and trouble is just a synonym (synonym)
Despite chemistry, it's so hard to overlook how we met
Miami hotel, girl, it's hard to forget

[Chorus]
Maybe it's just not our time (our time)
You got your life, I got mine (I got mine)
You're too far away, let's be real (let's be real)
To get too attached, let's be real (let's be real)
But baby on the other hand
We be kicking it, can't find nothing wrong with you
You stay up with me, help me with a song or two
Your momma loves me and I think my momma loves you too (oh-ooh, oh-ooh)
