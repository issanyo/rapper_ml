Ya, Ya
Strippers in Houston, I've been dabbling with quite a few
Couple million up, off a SoundCloud, that's quite a view
Y-O-U so mad, that's something that lames do
I don't need a pistol, but that's something that chains do
My visions they came true, and they keep on comin
I got women rapped around the block, and they keep on runnin
If I show my face, know your place
Think before you comment on this DIY Pioneer
Rich before I dotted on this line, don't cross it
My, on this ball shit
That's why I partnered instead of signed
50/50 profit
Moving state to state to state to state, to country hoppin
Poppin 20's for these bitches, nah, I got my 20's poppin
Ya
Buy my 40's, 40 B's is what my fortune reads
My advice, kill the verse, and let the chorus breath
40 G's that's a light weed
I ain't gotta say shit, they just get offended cause my ice speaks
Why he, got so many bad bitches down to be wifey?
Shout out to my women in the bay, gettin hyphee
I can get with the family, cause that's good for my psychee
Ridin round in Atlanta bumping Gucci, bitch I might be
Aye
