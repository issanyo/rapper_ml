[Hook: Russ]
I could go deeper on the beat to be honest
I could turn your girl into a freak to be honest
Lately I ain't really getting sleep to be honest
Life been changing every week to be honest

[Verse 1: Russ]
To be honest, I'm tired of my family needing money
To be honest, my visions always been twenty twenty
To be honest, I'm questioning where your heart lies
To be honest, America means apartheid
To be honest, I fuck way too many chicks raw
To be honest, Saudi King might cut my dick off
To be honest, white people are some terrorists
To be honest, I feel a way about sharing this
To be honest,  my patience is runnin thin so
To be honest, imma keep dropping these singles
To be honest, my debut is on my iPod
To be honest, fuck all that I need the lights on
To be honest, my house has been feeling homeless
To be honest, I kicked it at Lyor Cohen's
To be honest, everybody tryna' poach me
To be honest, know wassup when you approach me

[Hook: Russ]
I could go deeper on the beat to be honest
I could turn your girl into a freak to be honest
Lately I ain't really getting sleep to be honest
Life been changing every week to be honest

[Verse 2: Bugus]
To be honest, my fourth grade teacher was shady
To be honest, I flushed the pills my therapist gave me
To be honest, my teacher sucked my school was a mess
To be honest, I gave no fuck I cheated on tests
To be honest, with racism I know it still exists
To be honest, they hate niggas I see it in they grin
To be honest, I love my girl she satisfies me
To be honest, some other pussy looks appetizing
To be honest, be for God I don't believe in religion
To be honest, Uncle Sam is watching you like a pigeon
To be honest, I should of called my cousin Chuka
He havin babies, to be honest I should of called him sooner
To be honest, I just focus on the fundamentals
To be honest, I just hope to reach my full potential
To be honest, some things too mean to verbalize
Dick riders always get they dreams circumsized

[Verse 3: Russ]
To be honest, I think I should put my phone down
To be honest, I think I should put these hoes down
To be honest, I'm high and I'm drunk and that's okay
To be honest, I don't feel like paying Sallie Mae
To be honest, I think all my idols lost it
To be honest, they gon' notice when I walk in
To be honest, it's funny you think I need you
To be honest, I'm with Saudis up in Bijou
To be honest, I'm kinda' popping across the ocean
To be honest, fuck your label and it's cross promotion
To be honest, fuck every single industry plant
To be honest, look all you got is industry fans
To be honest, I'm taking shots and it's way too early
To be honest, it's actually late my days are blurry
To be honest, just know that I see everything
To be honest, how'd you come to terms with settling
