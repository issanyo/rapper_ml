[Verse]
Celebrating greatness, swear to God I'm like a toast away
The ones who know the least, always got the most to say
Poker face like Gaga to the online, hoopla and rah-rah
I'm movin' Nigerians if you tryin' to cause wahala
Floor to ceiling glass doors, 7-figure tax forms
Country hopper, my haters wish they had my passport
Flipping plans to the profit, I'm not a man I'm a prophet
I take my fam to the tropics and watch us land from the cockpit
All my idols either lost it or they're frauds now
Me, myself and I are my gods now
Y'all be tryin' to social climb, I be tryin' to climb the charts, uh
Y'all some bitches I feel that shit in my heart
Can't even tell y'all apart, lil who? Young what?
Another dick-riding clout chaser screaming "fuck Russ"
How original, y'all still think it's fly to go to Florida
I took a yacht from Sardinia to Corsica, uh
Do your Googles do your search engine shit
Y'all so broke you ain't even worth mentioning it
Excuse me fans I had to shit on my haters
I'm playin' Staples now I gotta coordinate with the Lakers
Man I'm a legend right now, let alone when they bury me
Billionaire convos while I'm sippin' wine with Gary V
You call my name as if, I'm a listen
I'm in my bed smokin' shisha with Moroccan women
I got the problem, lot of y'all's girls I had to block 'em
'cus I don't fuck with chicks who get offended by condoms
Say what I feel, deal with whatever that come
Because you only hurt yourself when you bitin' your tongue
You get offended 'cus you're bitch made
You were the type of kid to wear a cape in sixth grade
I got a catalog of mixtapes
Plus ninety somethin' songs
They play me every six days
Got my hair down I feel like Rick James
Turn your wifey to a super freak
I'm eatin' egusi soup with Igbo and Yoruba chiefs
My homies movin' me, like my silhouette, uh
Rappers gettin' beat on and pressed, missin' sets
We got in on video, Flex they be different in person
A lot of online tough guys are bitches in person
Y'all are comedy, God's been blessin' me lately
I'm in arenas off my first, I been judging you crazy
I'm gettin' [?] by the yacht load
I'm well acquainted with my god mode
You would think my fans are apostles
[?] I'm a flyin' V
I'm a business man, I got a couple I-N-C's
I move at godspeed, fuck y'alls pace, uh
More plaques man I'm runnin' out of wall space
On an island that you can't pronounce is mostly where you'll find me
Lookin' for a local girl that look like Jolie from the nineties
Actually, I be in the studio nightly
And I don't put it out unless I feel this shit inside me
Try me, you gon' have some stones on your head, uh
No conversations on the phone, that's dead, uh
You ain't a gangster you upholding a lie
'cus what type of gangsters be promotin' their crimes? haha
I'm out in Rome and they treat me like I'm Romeo
Then I'm Harajuku shoppin' toastin' out in Tokyo, uh
I'm my best friend, try not to reflect trends
Try to be myself, don't give a fuck if it offends them
I'm the star but my mom is the galaxy
She was upset so I put her on salary, uh
Hundred K to fly sixteen of us, uh
This dreams fronts us this, big screen coverage
On a jumbo, got me feeling everything but humble, uh
Shout out Kanye I'm just being Russ though
Lot of late nights in New York at the Ludlow
Lot of great whites in the industry'll cutthroat
Fuck 'em all 'cus you can't stop greatness
I love that my haters all hate this, yeah
Mm mmm hey, uh, yeah, haha
