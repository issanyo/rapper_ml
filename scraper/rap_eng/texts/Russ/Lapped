[Verse: Russ]
I get my inspiration from my own potential
Fuck yo taste I know what's hot I got my own credentials
I'm going crescendo
Off my own instrumentals
So I don't want your beats
I'm in the game you're in the stands
I don't want your seats
I'm heating up
Peep my numbers
Discovered around the world like Columbus
I'm the one it's been determined by my confidence
Always down to politic like show me what the offer is
Buzz startin to build like who brought Russ into the offices?
Accomplishments been stacking kinda' nicely as of late
But I'm tryna' get this flyin to get this dying to get this cake
Coulda signed and been on tour with your favorite independent
But imma' boss and a boss respects that
I'll be patient for my entrance
Cause the quicker you come in
Is the quicker that you exit
The more you fight the process
Is the less you really let it
Unfold how it's spose to
But let me pause the coaching
Cause my Spanish chick just rolled through
Don't get cold feet baby I know you got on snow shoes
But come here let me coax you
Got a little liquor and I guess that we can smoke too
I tried to put her on but she don't believe enough
She ain't that rough she ain't a rider she's not eve enough
But she's naive enough
To make me get unruly
Make me wanna' kick her out my car like I was Gucci
But I'm George Clooney in Oceans 11
I'm tryna' pull this caper off
Smirk at all the skeptics
Piss all of my neighbors off
And by neighbors I mean peers
And by peers I mean people who doubted me over the years
Cause I was living out their fears
This is that no excuses
Make a movement or get lapped
I couldn't do a 9-5
I felt like that was just a trap
I'm not racing round with rats
For a little piece of cheese
Imma' build my own factory
Retire at 33
I'm just rhyming on an island
Just tryna' get this mutha' fukkin' guap

[Outro: Russ]
This is for the young ones on they shit
No, no excuses
Young ones really on they no excuses
Oh yeah, no excuses
I never making no excuses
Young ones really on they shit, yeah
Young ones really on they shit, yeah
Oo-ooo no excuses
