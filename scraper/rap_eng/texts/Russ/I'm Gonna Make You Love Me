[Intro: Russ]
Yeah (yes I will)
Yeah
I mean I'm gonna' spit a little bit fast
Well faster than usual
Y'all gotta' just keep up a little bit
Give me at least that

[Verse 1: Russ]
Appreciating anonymity
Walking through the airport unnoticed
That'll be a real fly memory
But until I'm on, I pretend to be
Cause you are what you think
And I'm a legend in my head
But it's still not pretending me
I'm special, I don't guess so
Yeah I know it
I can even stop right now and let my instrumental show it

[Hook: Diana Ross & Russ]
I'm gonna' make you love me
Yeah
Oh I will, I will, I will
I told you Imma' make you love me
I'm gonna' make you love me
Y'all gotta' love this man
Oh I will, yes I will
Go 'head

[Post-Hook: Russ]
I've been at this for too long, long
You gon' love me
All I really got is songs
To make you love me (love me, love me)

[Verse 2: Russ]
Yeah, ongoing dreams for a decade plus
Y'all were hating in the hallways now you been playing Russ
Understandable, I'm handing you this playlist you're missing
And my family fucks with me but I can't just handle this vision
Damn

[Hook: Diana Ross & Russ]
I'm gonna' make you love me
I know y'all love me
Oh I will, I will, I will
I'm just tryna' show you what it could be
I'm gonna' make you love me
What it should be
Oh I will, yes I will
Yeah

[Post-Hook: Russ]
I've been at this for too long
You gon' love me
All I really got is songs
To make you love me
I've been at this for too long
You gon' love me
All I really got is songs
To make you love me

[Outro: Russ]
Yeah
I know me talking over this shit
You can't really like hear what the hook was saying but
It's really just- I think it's Diana Ross
She's saying I'm gonna' make you love me
I think anyone who does this shit just wants the love out of it
You know what I mean, like
I just want y'all to fuck with it
