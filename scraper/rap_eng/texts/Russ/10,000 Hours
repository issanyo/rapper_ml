Something fine in my Garcia Vega
Comin live from 10,000 hours later
Ya my self belief  is how I choose to get around life
And if you stayed down this is what it sounds like
Stayed down with my homies got an awesome team
Studio is looking like we bought a fog machine
Got Atlanta feeling like we in the Netherlands
Rap game veterans
Only getting better, It's
Nothing I remember my bank was Evisu jeans
I would squeeze each dollar til the eagle screams
I was born with super power only He could bring
I could read thru people I could see thru things
I'm not 17, I'm in the game now
I smoke Thunderchief, blessings rain down
So when shit hit the fan I'm calm naturally
Miracles only happen during a catastrophe
That's when your heart grow cold like people in Nova Scotia
I was taking cold showers, sleeping on old sofas
Tuckin the pain
Nigga took a bus and a train, to bust in the game
I wouldn't if there wasn't no pain
I remember when I used to have my eyes on Haley
Now I know it's real when you reach a milestone daily
I been a beat boomer, top rhymer
I remember when Bugus got nada
Now look up ya Bugus got it poppin
Russ still on the boards like Dennis Rodman
So much shit that I did for myself
Got so many plaques bout to sit on a shelf
Got so much shit I'm bout to drop on the chart
Got so much shit I'm bout to drop on your hearts
I got so much shit I'm bout to drop on the world
Got so much dick I'm bout to drop on ya girl

Imma take em back I was still smoking reggie
10 years later DIEMON got it smokin heavy
Fuck the hurricane boy we went and broke a levy
Used to throw shade now they only throw confetti
Mac brought em now got em back at the telly
They showin love these were the same bitches acting petty
Late night love creepin don't stop
We all got that one Jenny from the block
And I gotta little Latina Regina finer than Christina
Anita I need her 'cause she a goddess like Athena
I was probably last seen with Avena
My mamacita with an apple bum
So I just call her my La Bonita
I be on the Southside with my lil mama Dreka
Short thing brown skinned keeper
Gotta love Dreka
Dreka got African features but yesterday
I met up with Shanika at Spelman
Overwhelming
Head so good I shoulda brought a helmet
Hit the pussy good make the pussy sing
Got her with her top down money ain't a thing
And I don't really give a shit if my Mom hear the shit
'Cause she gon benefit from the bomb that I spit
And I don't give a shit if my dad hear the shit
'Cause he gon probably catch like mad benefits
Plus Donte got me looking like a magazine cover
Rolling weed up we got the whole magazine covered
And my pen goin nuts like cashews
Anything I ink it'll stick like tattoos
Ya it's about to be game O-V-E-R
On the beat so long need CPR
And I stay going in like VCR
I know real ass music don't need PR
Need privacy can't show all the things
No pic but i'm still scoring off the screen
Some people despise work cuz they have no mission
Some people their eyes work but they have no vision
Gotta new peace of mind I can smoke to
I know everything happen when it's supposed to
I do this shit forreal
This is how I pay my bills
10,000 hours laters it's like I paid my skills
I just went to the booth and I laid my ills
Used to be a lil wild now everyday I chill
We use cut class and smoke weed like the off days
In high school we hid zips in the hallways
I've always been good with the math
A couple things stuck from science class
We all solid, we smoke gas
We love moving around with liquid cash
Bitch

And it's only getting started
It's about to be a motherfucking problem
I got this shit on a fucking lockup
