[Intro]
Damn, not again
Know I shouldn't ask to tell me
Woah-oh-oohh

[Chorus]
Tell me if you want
Tell me if you want
Tell me if you want to love me
Don't tell me if you don't
Don't tell me if you don't
Don't tell me if you don't love me, love me

[Verse]
I love you girl
You know that shit
I love your mmmm
You give it to me, give it to me
If you're that girl
Come fuck with me
Come fuck with me
And give it to me, give it to me

[Pre-Chorus]
So climb on top and get it
Show what I'm rocking with it
Your body boat is floating way out, way out
So climb on top and get it
You know I got to hit it
Hit it so good you gon' stay down, stay down

[Chorus]
Tell me if you want
Tell me if you want
Tell me if you want to love me
Don't tell me if you don't
Don't tell me if you don't
Don't tell me if you don't love me, love me

[Verse]
Fucking with a new chick name Keyanna
Spanish girl, I see her ma√±ana
Make her hit high notes, Rihanna
Tryna' get in that vagina
But I chill, chill
Vodka on ice, ice
And give it to me, give it to me

[Pre-Chorus]
So climb on top and get it
Show what I'm rocking with it
Your body boat is floating way out, way out
So climb on top and get it
You know I got to hit it
Hit it so good you gon' stay down, stay down

[Chorus]
Tell me if you want
Tell me if you want
Tell me if you want to love me
Don't tell me if you don't
Don't tell me if you don't
Don't tell me if you don't love me, love me
