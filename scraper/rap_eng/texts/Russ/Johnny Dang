[Chorus]
Diamonds shine like Johnny Dang
Shine like Johnny Dang
All about the juice
Yeah, I just made yo bitch cum
People quick to hate us
Shoot em,' Max Payne
He acting delirious
Bro got hit with the K
Diamonds shine like Johnny Dang
Shine like Johnny Dang
All about the juice
Yeah, I just made yo bitch cum
People quick to hate us
Shoot em,' Max Payne
He acting delirious
Bro, got hit with the K

[Verse]
And I'm fuckin' furious, neno, Tre-8
Now, I'm runnin' thru the trap
I'm never out of shape
Sharks up in the water
I just feed em' to the gang
Jumping out the roof bitch, I had to hit a stain
I just wanted cooch but she only gave me brain
Played her like a game
Money, fuck some fame
Picked up another pack, this shit crazy everyday
He just tried the team
Now he dead, it's a shame

[Chorus]
Diamonds shine like Johnny Dang
Shine like Johnny Dang
All about the juice
Yeah, I just made yo bitch cum
People quick to hate us
Shoot em,' Max Payne
He acting delirious
Bro got hit with the K
Diamonds shine like Johnny Dang
Shine like Johnny Dang
All about the juice
Yeah, I just made yo bitch cum
People quick to hate us
Shoot em,' Max Payne
He acting delirious
Bro, got hit with the K
