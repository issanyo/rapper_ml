[Hook: Russ]
I love it when you talk like that
I love it when you move like that
I love it when you talk like that
I love it when you move like that

[Verse 1: Russ]
Ok I've been around the world
With my squad goin' up
And I wake up with the check
Everyday they showin' love
And it's just me getting started forreal
I'm tryna' get this money
I can't lie that shits important
Lost a couple people
I'm just tryna' do it for em
It's bigger than me forreal

[Hook: Russ]
I love it when you talk like that
I love it when you move like that
I love it when you talk like that
I love it when you move like that

[Verse 2: Russ]
In less than 360 days
My life did a 180
Feeling like I sipped 5 40's
I'm still spinning it's been crazy
Pop Pop died
My girl got pregnant
Thank God it wasn't mine though
She played me but still
I wouldn't press rewind though
Label offers
Crowd surfin
Damn it's been a blur
Sold out shows around the world
And it's just me getting started forreal
(Universe)

I love it when you talk like that
I love it when you move like that
I love it when you talk like that
I love it when you move like that
