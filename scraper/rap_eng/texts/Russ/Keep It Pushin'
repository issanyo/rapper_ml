[Chorus: Russ / Russ & Mahalia]
You ain't gotta wait up, I ain't 'bout to save ya
I'ma just be honest, I won't see you later
I'ma keep it pushin', you should keep it pushin'
We both know what's up, ayy
You ain't gotta wait up, I ain't 'bout to save ya
I'ma just be honest, I won't see you later
I'ma keep it pushin', you should keep it pushin'
We both know what's up, ayy

[Verse 1: Russ]
We were too young, not ready
I was wide-eyed, I loved heavy
You, made me think accidents ain't real
You, made me get passionate and feel
I think I get it, you really loved me
I learned my lesson, now I can trust me
Looking back, yeah it was a mess
At least you cared, got shit off your chest now
Guess I'm stuck, go back home
Grady baby, but she think she grown
Blowing up my phone like "where the fuck are you at?"
"Girl I'm in the studio, I thought you knew that"
Doesn't matter that we living in the same city
I promise I'm not lying when I say I'm busy
You ain't ready for the lifestyle I'm living
25 and settled down is not in my vision
Girl we not the same, our life's so different
Yeah
I think we should call it quits
I ain't got the time for the back-and-forth arguments
Unnecessary drama, gotta cut that
Everything but that, energy on fuck that
Boss shit, you either get it or you don't
And if you don't, I ain't got the time to tell you why you won'tâ€”
Ever get it, better end it now

[Chorus: Russ / Russ & Mahalia]
You ain't gotta wait up, I ain't 'bout to save ya
I'ma just be honest, I won't see you later
I'ma keep it pushin', you should keep it pushin'
We both know what's up, aye
You ain't gotta wait up, I ain't 'bout to save ya
I'ma just be honest, I won't see you later
I'ma keep it pushin', you should keep it pushin'
We both know what's up, aye

[Verse 2: Mahalia]
Okay, I think I get it
I think I finally understand what you been saying
You can't stay, now just admit it
For the longest time, you ain't been with it
Is it something I did?
Is it something I said?
'Cause I felt like I gave you more than I had to give
Oh I tried, I tried and you tried a little
I cried, I cried, I still cry a little
You say we both know what's up but
I don't know what's up with you
I don't know what I could do, I could do
You say we both know the deal but
I am scared that after this, I won't ever heal
Just so you know
All of this time you had me on Cloud 9
Hmm, just so you know
All through our lows, you made me feel high, yeah

[Chorus: Russ / Russ & Mahalia]
You ain't gotta wait up, I ain't 'bout to save ya
I'ma just be honest, I won't see you later
I'ma keep it pushin', you should keep it pushin'
We both know what's up, aye
You ain't gotta wait up, I ain't 'bout to save ya
I'ma just be honest, I won't see you later
I'ma keep it pushin', you should keep it pushin'
We both know what's up, aye
