Yeah, everybody needs to get away


No stress, wake up with no cameras on
Livin' in the amazon
Knowing that I can't be wrong
Feelin' so blessed
Walkin' through this wonderland
Give a look to to Alice just enough for her to understand
That we should go sex


But then it's back to traveling, all around utopia
Where phobias' don't have a friend
Yes I am imagining, I prefer it this way
Lost enough to love in my reality it was misplaced, no mistake
I escaped, all the way to Shangri-La, lounging in my palace
Feeling like i'm Genghis Khan, scotch is in my chalice
Hummingbirds play my song
