[Hook x2: Russ + John Anthony]
I see my vision in my mirror
I'm just hoping that it waits for me
I see my life in the distance
Hope it doesn't run away from me

[Verse 1: Russ]
I think until I bring my thoughts around
Drink until my problems drown
Cruise around sunset
Hopin' that the sun don't go down
Makin' life on sacrifices
Yeah, I make these beats
Cause I been wrapped up in my vices
My advice to myself
Listen to yourself, trust you
We fuck over ourselves
So it's never really fuck you
Let me do my one two
Step up to the plate
You can't undo the past
So just rely on your faith
But fuck faith, make a wave

[Hook: Russ + John Anthony]
I see my vision in my mirror
I'm just hoping that it waits for me
I see my life in the distance
Hope it doesn't run away from me

[Verse 2: John Anthony]
I been homeless two years today
And I swear that I'm in motion
And these times are
Harder than bone marrow
I'm gloomy as rainy days
My momma say
Never thunder only the rain
Ok, hot as August
Close shore this summer
I'm here to die
She's here to smoke
And I wonder why
Cause I'm the fire
Mr. Crazy, I'm oil heavy
She's red papaya
Gave me a hundred dollars
Mr. Without A Dime
You can call that love
I call it trapped inside
Cause I got six mistress'
Two businesses
And I keep singing sugar lies
Oh sugar why
Oh sugar why

I see my vision in my mirror
I'm just hoping that it waits for me
I see my life in the distance
Hope it doesn't run away from me
