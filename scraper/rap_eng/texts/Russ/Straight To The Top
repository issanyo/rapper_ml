[VERSE 1]
Got As in the classroom
I was still rollin dice in the bathroom
Came alive in 99 been doin my thing in Atlanta since Shareef Abdur Rahim
Always knew in time it would b done
Vision playin in my mind like a re run
Before it happened seen it all
Like I gotta crystal ball

[HOOK]
When I walk in it's
Straight to the top
We ain't gotta talk get
Straight to the top
Cream will rise
Straight to the top
Came in the game went
Straight to the top

[VERSE 2]
I plan on things goin better than I plan
Plan on shows overseas I'm the man
Plan on gettin my respect
Plan on catchin all these checks
Plan on helpin out the fam
You know I'm clearin all these debts
And I'm livin unrealistic
Don't ever get it twisted

[HOOK]
When I walk in it's
Straight to the top
We ain't gotta talk get
Straight to the top
Cream will rise
Straight to the top
Came in the game went
Straight to the top

[VERSE 3]
My life is so precious
So do not waste a second
Of my time or I'll get reckless
Until you get the message
My life is so precious
So do not waste a second
Of my time or I'll get reckless
Until you get the message

[HOOK]
When I walk in it's
Straight to the top
We ain't gotta talk get
Straight to the top
Cream will rise
Straight to the top
Came in the game went
Straight to the top
