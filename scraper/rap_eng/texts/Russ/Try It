[Hook: Russ]
I dare you to come and try it
But nobody's shaking round here
Yes I got it so you want it
But I ain't see you here last year
Bet you won't try it
No no
I bet you won't try it

[Verse 1: Russ]
Your favorite rapper can't fuck with with me
Girls fall in love with me
Childhood dreams, yeah I'm fighting for my custody
There's one of me, there's a lot of you
Listening to the radio and it's probably you
But who are you? I don't even think you know
They don't believe that I plan it, like Pluto
I'm interrupting the conversation
Enough with the observations
I'm fucking up the structure
Standing up for the population
It's real shit coming through your playlist
Family needs food, bills need payments
But I see money in the bank with my name on it
Rearranging rules, yeah I'm changing up the game on ya
I got a chip that weighs the size of a brick
I might flip and do some shit that's gonna' help me get rich quick
This ain't a thing you should try
I protect this with my life
Cause my life is what I gave
For my life I would die

[Hook: Russ]
I dare you to come and try it
But nobody's shaking round here
Yes I got it so you want it
But I ain't see you here last year
Bet you won't try it
No no
I bet you won't try it

[Verse 2: Russ]
All this time in between got me anxious
Family looking at me like, save us
I got to get to where I'm going now, oh oh
Stepping up to the plate when they need me
This is what I practiced for
This is what I'm asking for, for, for, for
I made my name get bigger
Stayed with my faith like liquor up in my vains
My trigger fingers my brain
I figured I should do me
Looking back I was blinded by what I really couldn't see
23, I'm so happy I didn't blow at 17
They be stupid
I don't play against you
I play against the idea of me losing
See the blueprint I sketched out
I was right all along to let your opinions get left out

[Hook: Russ]
I dare you to come and try it
But nobody's shaking round here
Yes I got it so you want it
But I ain't see you here last year
Bet you won't try it
No no
I bet you won't try it
