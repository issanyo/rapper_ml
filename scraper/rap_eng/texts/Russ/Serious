[Verse 1]
We've been knowin' about each other for a while now
Ain't no past we could have taken for this lifestyle
I had a girl, you had a man but that was long ago
Evolvin' daily, please don't judge me off a song ago
I know you ain't gonna wait forever
I know that it's gonna take more effort
You ain't gotta tell me what I gotta do to prove it to you, I know

[Chorus]
Baby take me serious
Baby take me serious
Baby take me serious
(mm-hmm, mm-hmm, hmm)
Baby take me serious
Baby take me serious
Baby take me serious
(mm-hmm, mm-hmm, hmm)

[Verse 2]
ATL, you're on call
I just toured, I just balled
I got time now, girl I'm ready
You so fed up, you won't test me
You say I say that I'm busy
Way too much but you still miss me
I still fuck you, you still kiss me
Let all your resentment go

[Chorus]
Baby take me serious
Baby take me serious
Baby take me serious
(mm-hmm, mm-hmm, hmm)
Baby take me serious
Baby take me serious
Baby take me serious
(mm-hmm, mm-hmm, hmm)

[Verse 3]
Yuh, I’ve been thirsty since before your water broke
I’ve been thirsty since before Tha Carter IV
You teach Spanish and you work nights in the club
Life is falling into place, but not in love
I'm still tryna see you even though I fucked already
I ain't kick you out even after I bust already
You think that I'll choose another woman over you
Fuck talkin', I'ma show you

[Chorus]
Baby take me serious (Fuck talkin', fuck talkin')
Baby take me serious
Baby take me serious
(mm-hmm, mm-hmm, hmm)
Baby take me serious
Baby take me serious
Baby take me serious
(mm-hmm, mm-hmm, hmm)

[Outro]
(Fuck talkin', fuck talkin', fuck talkin', fuck talkin')
(Fuck talkin', fuck talkin', fuck talkin', fuck talkin')
