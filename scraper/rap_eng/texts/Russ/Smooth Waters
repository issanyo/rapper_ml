VERSE 1]
Smooth waters don't make skilled sailors
Life ain't always what it seem you ain't a skilled tailor
Gotta treat it like Vegas you play the hand ya dealt
Rule 1 no trust Teddy Roosevelt
Control ya self you know ya self
That's what you told ya self
You know the goal is hole in one
Thats what you owe ya self
Stuck in a world always bringin out my inner beast
Gotta take the time to focus on my inner peace all my energies

[VERSE 2]
Whenever they can't define you Wikipedia does
God doesnt make celebrities the media does
Damn, y'all got me lookin crazy at humanity
Politics, jealousy racism, vanity
What part of the game is that? That shit is lame & wack
In a world bringin out my inner beast
Gotta take the time to focus on my inner peace all my energies

[VERSE 3]
I got love for my fans
Give em shit that I go thru
I spread the word out by hand
See back then I was local
But now I'm global and the difference is persistence
And when they all have something to say i never listen
I know my intuition got me right in this position
And if the shit ain't broken I ain't 'bout to do no fixin
Plus I'm livin in a world bringin out my inner beast
Gotta take the time to focus on my inner peace all my energies
