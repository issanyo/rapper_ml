[Verse 1]
I've been outta state
You've been stuck in yours
It's not personal
When you call me and I ignore you, damn
I'm just tryna detach, detach
I rarely ever get time to relax
But when I do I'm just tryna rejuvenate, meditate

[Chorus]
But I fuck with you from a distance (yeah, oh)
I fuck with you from a distance (yeah)
I fuck with you from a distance

[Verse 2]
You want me to free time
To talk to you, but I
Only talk to you when I got free time
I guess that's the difference
Between Ms. and Mrs
You lookin' for someone who's got time

[Chorus]
But I fuck with you from a distance (yeah, oh)
I fuck with you from a distance (yeah)
I fuck with you from a distance

[Verse 3]
Yeah, she don't really care about the fame or the dollars
She be bad as fuck in a hoodie and some joggers
I be on the road ignoring all her FaceTimes
Not tryna break hearts, but I'm on my break time
I just did tours non-stop
Had girls on all fours and on top
I had sisters, I had cousins doin' freak shit
Now I'm tryna chill, smoke weed, make these hits
I know I promised
But sometimes shit pops up when you're poppin'
Damn, I know we text a lot
When I see you, best believe we having sex a lot
Connect the dots
Before you try and draw conclusions
Love is feeling like it's all illusions
I'm still young, lemme go through my phases
Lemme adjust, girl, I just got famous

[Chorus]
But I fuck with you from a distance (yeah, oh)
I fuck with you from a distance (yeah)
I fuck with you from a distance
