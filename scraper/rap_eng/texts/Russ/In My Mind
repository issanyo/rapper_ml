[Verse 1: Bugus]
Uh, I'm the greatest on the planet
I can't be stopped
So cocky in my mind
Like these can't be thoughts
I was taught to be humble
Talkin' back was rude
But then I started smokin' blunts
And walkin' back to school
Like, fuck it
My shirt won't tuck it
Take it back to tenth grade
Blowin' blunts in the bucket so
Lookin' for me, I'll be on the beach bitch
Countin' C notes on a boat gettin' sea sick
Now you quote what I wrote, I'm a beast bitch
Cause when I spoke, always spoke of the G6
Chrome spokes, always hope I would reach this
Now I reap results of what I spoke and I don't need shit
I won't preach shit if you won't purchase
You're sure to find a purpose in my sermon every service
And I don't give a fuck
You only live once
So I need the gold Rollie with the diamonds in the front like
Bling

[Hook: Russ]
I feel it all the time
I know how to make it stop
But I just want my shine
So I'm never gonna' stop
So let me be
Don't envy me
This is all that's in my mind
Oh-ooh

[Verse 2: Dartlin]
Uh, got the prezi with the bezi for my whole team
Cause at 18 I told 'em we would mold dreams
Now I'm almost 21, I'm gettin' closer to the one
Tyrna' make a million bucks so I can buy drinks
Yeah they sellin' a lot but I don't by dreams
Get your wack ass act out of my scene
Stackin' plaque on plaque
I'm back on track
My Mack intact
And that's just that
My rhyme scheme
They love it
Can't touch it
Or budge it
No budget on buds
Cause I love it
Hotbox, hot rides, pot smothered
Roast in that ghost
You hoes are hokes
Cause I know what I know
And doesn't a bomb blow
If you had it all
Maybe you would half it all
Everybody's tryna' grab it
But they ladder's small
Separate the actual from factual
Strategize and improvise
And maybe you can have it all

[Hook: Russ]
I feel it all the time
I know how to make it stop
But I just want my shine
So I'm never gonna' stop
So let me be
Don't envy me
This is all that's in my mind
Oh-ooh

[Verse 3: Russ]
Uh, I'm zoned out with a bad one
Honey's taken action
Back seat, flat screen
Let her grip the Magnum
But if she acts dumb
Imma' have to dip out
Smoke a blunt, make a beat
Probably put the shit out
Cause it never stops
Even when I'm fuckin'
Hits are running through my mind
And I don't say nothin'
Til I should bitch
And if I do, I'm saying something like
What's good bitch
I wish you would bitch
Anyways, back to this bangin' ass beat that I made
You'll probably try to buy it but I keep what I make
I don't give a fuck
Cause this my life and this my child
I won't give it up
So start givin' up
Cause you ain't gon' get it
Unless you part of DIEMON
Unless your cheese is breaded
You can find me on an island
With my feet in the sand, weed in my hand
Even in my dreams I'm makin' beats cause I can

[Hook: Russ]
I feel it all the time
I know how to make it stop
But I just want my shine
So I'm never gonna' stop
So let me be
Don't envy me
This is all that's in my mind
Oh-ooh
