[Intro]
Yeah, it's crazy
Yeah, I need y'all to listen
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't give up
Know it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't

[Verse 1]
Yeah, my parents' marriage in shambles, I won't lie, it hurts
I thought money would fix it, but it just made it get worse
See my dad was the man, 'til his job cut ties
He went broke, I got rich, that shit fucked with his pride
Yeah, I recognize it was disturbing to see
The family stopped turnin' to him and started turnin' to me
Going through it, I know he tried to hide the pain
If he gave up and got a job, his dad died in vain
'Cause his dad ran a business
So my dad tried to run one too but there's a difference
No income, my dad started loosin' his confidence
Meanwhile everyday I got brand new accomplishments
At the height of my career was his lowest
And that's a lie, 'cause we both still goin'
Me up, him down, it caused a lot of angst
Argument got out of hand, had to call Frank
All my efforts ignored, he threw it all in my face
There's not a song long enough where I can say what I gave
Shit's crazy, mom couldn't believe him
I mean she's cried in the past, you know, threatened to leave him
But she never had the money to, but I got it now
It's bittersweet that this is how I bought my mom a house
Oh well, guess I should have seen it comin'
All the tears, all the threats, all the fightin' and fussin'
Hardly any lovin', way too much hate
Finally tried to change, mom said it's too late
Move out day came and went, still in shock, shit
Doesn't even know where my mom's new spot is
Wasn't the first time but this was the worst time
Hurt by your own family is the worst kind
All this shit been happenin' while I was blowin' up
And it's still going on, now you know what's up

[Chorus]
Yeah, it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't give up
Know it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I got way too much stress for any more bad press
Especially another lie that they make up and stretch
Damn, I can't lie, shit is takin' a toll
So much hate sent to me, some stays in my soul
To the point that when I walk into the booth, that's what I let out
Makes for good songs but mentally I'm tryna get out
Tryna focus on the good, not the evil
Can't complain, is how I always greet people
I'm exhausted, exasperated from the pain that I'm facin' and masquerading
Don't get it twisted, I'm grateful for everything
But the devil's still asking for a wedding ring
I decline, try to focus on love
Try to focus on fans, try to focus on Russ
Everyday another lie, sometimes it feels like a curse
Sometimes it feels like necessary preparation for first

[Chorus]
Yeah, it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't give up
Know it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't
Yeah, it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't give up
I know it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, no
