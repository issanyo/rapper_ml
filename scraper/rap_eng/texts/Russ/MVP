Life’s a search, never lose myself
Life’s a struggle, gotta proved myself
If they decide not to help me
Ima do it myself
Forget what they want, i do this for myself
It’s like
You left me hangin, you left me stranded
You took everything from me 
I don’t know what happened 
Thought everything was fine 
Thought everything perfect
All those hours in the gym 
Was it all really worth it
Cuz my starting 5 left 
Like they forfeit the game
Left me by myself
There’s no back up team
Left all alone, like they fled the scene
Left in the road, just another dead dream
It’s like
What i ever do to you, nothing at all
Except worship you and pray until i fall 
Asleep from from pain, cuz there was so much of it
First you took my brother 
My father and my mother
Took my other brother
Putting him in prison 
Kinda Makes me wonder, when i pray
Do you listen ? 
Flew to DR on a trip for your mission
Still I’m left in a house with no food in the kitchen
Like
Makes me wonder, did i make a mistake
Like i did something wrong
So you put me in place
Nah
See i kno you, i kno how you work
See i kno you, I’ve been going to church
See i kno you, Ive studied the Bible
See i kno you, these are just some more trials
A test to my faith
To see if I’ll stay
But you just making it harder
To stay in my place
Until i realize my purpose to keep me in place
And realize who you sent to keep me in place
So now i have no choice
There’s no room for mistakes
Cuz there’s somebody counting on me
To keep them in place
And i
Made a promise
To always have their back
No matter what they go thru
And I promised that’s a fact
When we make it big
Tour buses on the road
Selling out tours
Never sell my soul
Headed towards the goal
Like Ronaldo
Can’t wait for the future
Now I’m in beast mode
Never RIP only MVP
Learning for success
Perseverance is the key
And never giving up on what you believe
I kno there’s people out there going thru the same things
Where they feel alone and facing defeat
But i promise keep faith and keep chasing you’re dreams
Cuz that’s what ima do for my friends and family
Always keep grinding it out
Leticia bufoni
And i promise in the end it’s gon pay off
Cuz ima keep grind like Lebron in the playoffs
Like damn
