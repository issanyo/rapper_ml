[Chorus]
No fake shit against me shall prosper
Yes I came I saw I conquered
No fake shit against me shall prosper
Yes I came I conquered
And they don't wanna see you win
So its fuck them till the end
And they always gonna hate
Always gonna have some shit to say
And they don't wanna see you win
So its fuck them till the end
And they always gonna hate
Always gonna have some shit to say

[Verse 1]
Eating in Italy
Golfing in Glasgow
Swimming in Switzerland
Mr international
All off these rap flows
All off these chord progressions
All of these kicks, snares, melodies and tour investments
I put my own money up so no one tells me shit
I know what you about to say before you tell me it
You so predictable
I'm so in tune with it
I gotta folder with a lotta women's nudes in it
I gotta Rolex
I gotta lotta chains
But none of that is worth as much as memories that I've gained
I'm flying PJ's
50,000 each way
Live from the peach-state
I hit the sweepstakes
These days they all scream Russ
Some are screaming hate
Some are screaming love
Fuck it everytime you judge I get paid
That's what my mom told me
I'ma cop the wheels of fortune cause you owe me
Pat sayjak shit, pat sayjak shit
Might get a maybach for maybach just to say that shit
I gave a million to the government
I pay taxes
Did I say government I meant the mob
I hate that shit
Legal extortion of half my fortune
Soon as the tour ends a portion of my racks like Nordstrom gets taxed
If that's the cost of doing business dog I need loopholes
Luckily the money getting longer than manute bol
Sumo it's time to put my foot down
Picked up the gin around the time I put the kush down
I still smoke a little but not without a shot in me
Connected to my higher self yeah that's the God in me
I'm just tryna stay on top like an apostrophe
Bitch I'm tryna win fuck only being a nominee
I'm a one of one, Russ is an anomaly
Coming to your city and boosting its economy

[Chorus]
No fake shit against me shall prosper
Yes I came I saw I conquered
No fake shit against me shall prosper
Yes I came I conquered
And they don't wanna see you win
So its fuck them till the end
And they always gonna hate
Always gonna have some shit to say
And they don't wanna see you win
So its fuck them till the end
And they always gonna hate
Always gonna have some shit to say

[Bridge]
Just live your truth and do you
They hate honesty boo hoo
Just count up all your blessings
Big or small they're still all blessings

[Verse 2]
Three accounts each over a milli
Rap game so crazy if I'm sober I'm silly
Yeah I drink, yeah I smoke
But that's natural elixirs
You live like your future ain't in the picture
I'm high up out in Malibu
The road to real wealth is always paved with different avenues
The difference in dividends
Is multiple businesses
I got end of year goals too big for Christmas lists
I'm dropping these jewels
I'm breaking the rules
I take your negativity and I use it as fuel
These rappers are food
Yeah I'm still hungry
I own apartment complexes that's real money

[Chorus]
No fake shit against me shall prosper
Yes I came I saw I conquered
No fake shit against me shall prosper
Yes I came I conquered
And they don't wanna see you win
So its fuck them till the end
And they always gonna hate
Always gonna have some shit to say
And they don't wanna see you win
So its fuck them till the end
And they always gonna hate
Always gonna have some shit to say
