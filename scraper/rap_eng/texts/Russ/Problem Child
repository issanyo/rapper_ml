[Hook: Russ]
How'd it go so wrong
This ain't the best you
You've been so wrong since I met you
How'd it get so wrong
This ain't the best you
It's been so wrong since I met you

[Verse 1: Russ]
You came into a fixed world, in a broken home
You lack guidance, so you feeling so alone
Cause out the womb you had no room to excel
Feeling like a demon seed so what's next, hell
Or better yet jail
And it's hard when its predetermined that you shouldn't prevail
So you throw on some 2Pac
Light a pair of L's
Crack a pair of bottles until you just parasail
Away from the truth, straight towards the lies
Go on hang a noose on yo life 'till you die
That's what you doing

[Hook: Russ]
How'd it go so wrong
This ain't the best you
You've been so wrong since I met you
How'd it get so wrong
This ain't the best you
It's been so wrong since I met you

[Verse 2: Russ]
I tried to take you to a world that was different than yours
I opened opportunity you should have opened the door
And once I drew the line
I had you askin' who am I?
Yeah, I got the password
Y'all frontin' like this world ain't fucking backwards
These rappers need their daddies
Hoes need their daddies
That's why they mix and mingle and get along
But y'all can pass me with that bullshit
You tryin' to fill this void inside a bottle
This void inside a blunt
This void inside a model
But your daddy's what you want
But you looking in the wrong place
And y'all idolizing lives
So y'all looking in the wrong face
And y'all do it all the time
What I'm tryna' say

[Hook: Russ]
How'd it go so wrong
This ain't the best you
You've been so wrong since I met you
How'd it get so wrong
This ain't the best you
It's been so wrong since I met you

[Outro: Russ]
Y'all need to look within
Y'all need to look within
