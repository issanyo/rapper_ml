[Intro: Russ]
Yeah... I can tell
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook x2: Russ]
I can tell you wanna' come say something
You should go ahead and stop pretending
I wake up feeling richer than my last day
And go to sleep still tryna' get it

[Verse 1: Russ]
I roll the dice with my life
I got a gambling problem
I got this movie I'm shooting
I need the cameras on me
In Atlanta I'm probably
In the studio working
Or getting blessed by Latinas
You know the usual service
I move with a purpose
You know what it is, boss shit
You see my name on the marquee, it's all biz
And you know what to do when the don walks in
I said, you know what to do when the don walks in
Come on

[Hook x2: Russ]
I can tell you wanna' come say something
You should go ahead and stop pretending
I wake up feeling richer than my last day
And go to sleep still tryna' get it

[Verse 2: Russ]
Tryna' figure out what the fuck I spent 10 G's on, but fuck it
Back to sipping till the hennys gone, my bucket, hoes love it
I got 10's in my Nissan
Imagine when I got the president rollie on
Gotta' Puerto Rican, tryna' get her freak on
But Imma' world traveler so I might be overseas, on some spreading out my wings shit
30,000 feet sipping gin with my kings talking king shit

[Hook x2: Russ]
I can tell you wanna' come say something
You should go ahead and stop pretending
I wake up feeling richer than my last day
And go to sleep still tryna' get it

[Refrain: Russ]
I know you see me from a distance
Didn't believe, now you do
Makes me think it's a...
Money thing, money thing, money thing, money thing
Money thing, money thing, money thing, money thing

[Hook x2: Russ]
I can tell you wanna' come say something
You should go ahead and stop pretending
I wake up feeling richer than my last day
And go to sleep still tryna' get it
