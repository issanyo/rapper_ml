[INTRO]
Season change feelings fade things never be the same

[VERSE 1]
I was coming off too aggressive and possessive
Then you cut me off really taught my ass a lesson
Now the fun is lost Im sick so congested
The thought of losing my blessing
Had me down I was stressing
Sometimes we can't explain things we do for lust
Id rather lose all my bucks before I lose your trust
If i could take back my dirt and reverse the hands of time
I would take back my word I couldn't keep it at the time
Now my credibility feels like it shots forever
Tryna make things right we ain't got forever
We need to focus on time we got together
And all the fun times we had when we got together
Funny back now cuz at first we were close
And the fact that you can't trust me is what hurts me the most
I was everything girl I was ya confidant
Now I gotta play it cool all nonchalant

[VERSE 2]
I was scared to lead a life with no purpose
And I was actin like my cell phone had no service
When I finally picked up
Damn right I missed calls
When I didn't write
Yall I was having withdrawals
And I know you mad I chose music over you
Distracted by my goals how I put em over you
I was always havin shows
Always gotta show to do
All the feelings I expose end up exposing you
But that wasn't my intention
I forgot to mention you caught my attention
I need an intervention
When she walked out she walked with my devotion
Never sweat my rhymes she was poetry in motion
And these days when I text its a late response
Love is an acquired taste
Guess the taste was gone
Used to sit around and talk like
“Is there really a God?”
Me and you were two peas in a pod but now your gone

[VERSE 3]
Season change feelings fade things won't be the same
Ain't got no time for regrets time for better things
Ridin for my dreams gotta go giddyup!
You still got my number if you wanna hit me up
You fell in love with me because I was honest
That same honesty filled up this sonnet
You fell in love with me because I was on it
And when you left me you call me “workaholic”
That contradiction got my mind on the double
That contradiction almost got me in trouble
And when I see you my emotions are numb
So id rather say it over drums
I wouldve gave my lung
Shit I wouldve gave my Son
If Im lying God is taking my tongue
I was the faithfulest one
I was pacing this one
But I guess she wasn't patient enough
I couldn't say it enough
