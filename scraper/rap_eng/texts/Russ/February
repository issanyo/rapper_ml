[Hook: Russ]
And it may hurt right now
Feeling cursed right now
But it's the worse right now
Cause I know this shit is temporary
Yeah I know this shit is temporary
Shoulda' known that you were temporary
I'll be over you by February

[Refrain: Russ]
You are me
And I am you
We could be
One, one, one, one

[Verse: Russ]
I ain't tryna' shit on you
I dove in, head first
In your swimming pool
Got a little bit of weed
And I'm drinking too
Just did an interview with double X-L
Hope you don't get offended
I said what I said and I meant it
It's real like that
What you did to the kid
Man it feels like that
You had a knife in your hand
And you didn't even know it
But now it's in my back
I can show it
Gave you the power to break trust
I just trust that wouldn't
Do me the same
But you did
That's a damn shame
Damn shame
That's a damn shame

[Hook: Russ]
And it may hurt right now
Feeling cursed right now
But it's the worse right now
Cause I know this shit is temporary
Yeah I know this shit is temporary
Shoulda' known that you were temporary
I'll be over you by February
