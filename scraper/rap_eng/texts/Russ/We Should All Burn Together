[Intro: Russ]
I guess this one's for the world
Yeah

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

[Verse 1: Russ]
Yeah, I'm a lover, I'm a fighter
I'm a brother, I'm a writer
I'm a soul equipped with the voice
Who took the choice to turn the mic up
See a lot of human beings doing life inside they mind cause
They're born into the bondage, mental slavery till it's time to
Either die or break the shackles, tell me what's the difference
I'm just tryna live as free as I can while I'm existing
In this realm, I swear it's hell until you break free
But I'mma break the boundaries
Before the boundaries ever break me, but

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling our father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

[Verse 2: Russ]
I need your ears, I need your fears to disintegrate
I see the years, I see the tears, but put love in that place
I know it seems like sometimes the sunshine forgets to do its job
Cause all you know is rain and pain
And the chains just won't come off
Cause God doesn't feel so close anymore
When your mind is so far gone
The Devil's got a hold on your soul, they've got this bond
That's so strong, I just hope I encourage you to break it
There's no wrong in trying to do right even if you don't make it

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling our father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling our father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
