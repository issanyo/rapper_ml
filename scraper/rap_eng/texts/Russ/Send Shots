[HOOK]
Can't be one of us so they
Send shots
They saw the hate want enough so they
Send shots
We at war with the cops so they
Send shots
Don't wanna see us on top so they
Send shots

[VERSE 1]
Invested all in myself
I'm the best stock
Motherfuckers makin hits
I'm the red sox
Tryna turn myself into S-dot
Have the mothafuckin game ina headlock
See they mad I'm the man n I'm mad hot
Got these critics all twisted like a dreadlock
Onslaught onsinght when ya on top
See these hater won't stop til a man drop

[HOOK]
Can't be one of us so they
Send shots
They saw the hate want enough so they
Send shots
We at war with the cops so they
Send shots
Don't wanna see us on top so they
Send shots

[VERSE 2]
No benefit of the doubt when he gets shot
Another black man down on the next block
Same thing nonstop switch the damn plot
Tired of seein niggas on the news 6 oclock
12 come try to take what a man got
Ima run like benny from the sandlot
They say black peoplealways wanna hand out
But what they call that when they was givin land out
