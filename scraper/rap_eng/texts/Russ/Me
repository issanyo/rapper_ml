[Verse 1: Russ]
Yeah, tryna' get this Nas feature
Bugus rolling up a lot of reefer
I hit it once, record my voice
But these are God speakers
Take over the game
This is our Ether
Too many bitches, it's a blur
So I called neither
I call Aretha
Tell her Franklin
Needs to hit my bank
And make me call Katrina
So I make it rain
Turn this world into some ballerinas
The fallacy is I'm a freshman
And been a senior, lapped ya'
Got more beats and more stars than your favorite rappa'
I'm passed the Zenith
This is what it sounds like to be dreamin'
In reality, believin' and achievin'
Those far-fetched omens
Turning into moments
Turning into memories
I swear I'm out here floatin'

[Hook: Chioma]
Let me take a shot of me
Let me take a hit of me
I'm doing drugs
Let me take a dab of me
Let me put me in my gums
I'm doing drugs

[Verse 2: Russ]
Yeah, mmmm
Two tabs of the Lucy
Three shots of the gin
Four pulls on the weed
Five hoes on my...
Mmmm... (laughs)
Yeah
Let me tell y'all, mmmm

[Hook: Chioma]
Let me take a shot of me
Let me take a hit of me
I'm doing drugs
Let me take a dab of me
Let me put me in my gums
I'm doing drugs

[Outro: Russ & Chioma]
Let me take a shot of me
Let me take a hit of me
I'm doing drugs
Let me take a dab of me
Let me put me in my gums
I'm doing drugs
