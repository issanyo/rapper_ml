[Verse 1: Russ]
All I can do is hope that I don't have to go through what I already went through, again
You know my gut is full
You know my cup is full
And it's spilling, for you
Don't you turn out the same
This ain't no game to me
This ain't no game to me

[Bridge: Russ]
Are you moving back?
Don't ask me if I'm cool with that
Cause you know I need the whole thing
Yeah, you know I need the whole thing, from you

[Hook: Russ]
Baby I, maybe I
Should wait until I see you naked
Not your body
I'm talking 'bout your soul
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Believe in me, like I believe in you
I'm screaming fuck it if you trust it it's just me and you
Don't act for me, don't lie to me
Just keep it super super super super super fucking real
Just keep it super super super super super fucking real
Just keep it super fucking real
Just keep it super fucking real

[Bridge: Russ]
Are you moving back?
Don't ask me if I'm cool with that
Cause you know I need the whole thing
Yeah, you know I need the whole thing, from you

[Hook: Russ]
Baby I, maybe I
Should wait until I see you naked
Not your body
I'm talking 'bout your soul
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
