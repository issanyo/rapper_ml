[Intro: Russ]
Too many people just dying, and im not even talkin physically

[Verse 1: Russ]
Last week was Seattle
In two weeks itll be Denver
In between was New York City and Atlanta on my schedule
Its apparent ive adopted a new lifestyle
Flyin round this country rackin up these fuckin skymiles
Got my girl back home feelin trapped straight suffocating
But dont you worry
Cause the moves that need to be made to break you out
Russ is making
And they tell me I should sing more
I just tell 'em cool yo
Thats why I dropped that How To Rob
And bit yalls hands like cujo
I thought high school ended
But yall still playin daddys ball
So yall might blow up quicker
But yall won't stay up yall need adderall
And half these magazines
And damn near all these writers
Are a bunch of fucking failed musicians talkin shit to spite us
But secretly they like us
So dont stick out your hand to me
Get back to your 9-5 and your class
And watch me live your fuckin fantasy

[Hook x2: Russ]
Y'all needa get up and get out now
Do something with all of your time
Hope you recognize who you are and what you could do
Hope that you're not lost in your mind

[Verse 2: Russ]
My ex chick was a handful
Had to cut her off cuz i already got my hands full
Hate to break it to you
But your shows been cancelled
Russ taking over every channel
Ran thru some latinas in my area
Just to clear my head real quick
Bout to fly to paris on a jet real quick
We use to study latin
Me and Bugus
Now we study actualizing dreams into cash and
Makin shit happen wassup

[Hook x2: Russ]
Y'all needa get up and get out now
Do something with all of your time
Hope you recognize who you are and what you could do
Hope that you're not lost in your mind

[Verse 3: Russ]
I treat this world like a canvas
My mind is the paint brush
Fuck you and him and her
Yall motherfuckers ain't Russ
Can't touch the young god
Feelin like an OG
Might as well hit the blunt
Now where the fucks the OE
Follow closely
To the only
Motherfucker keepin it so me
Authentic
Short term
Beach house for my mom
Long driveway
Cars in it
Superstar vision while cigars spinning
Imma phoenix how i walk in (joaquin) it
Recognized the fire embraced it then i walked in it
Rebirth when i walked thru it
Sinatra smooth with a Pac vision
Pop vocals rock livin
Got caught slippin
By the police had to ditch that bitch
God hittin my phone
Devil pullin up at my spot
Every once in a while they switch positions
Just to flip flop on me
I could turn a paddle boat into a yacht homie
Only real ones let on board you better know me
Im the gilligan
Feelin like I'm boutta cash out
Hair down middle fingers up with my ass out
My mind is the traphouse
Man this bitch is bunkin
Imma full time magician
Turnin nothing into something
Tell me what the fuck is up

[Hook x2: Russ]
Y'all needa get up and get out now
Do something with all of your time
Hope you recognize who you are and what you could do
Hope that you're not lost in your mind
