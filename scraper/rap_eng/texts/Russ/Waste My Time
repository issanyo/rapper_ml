[Verse 1: Russ]
Hit the meeting let them know
Where the fuck my head is at
After shows, ask the hoes
Where the fuck my head is at I collect every check I prefer a wire transfer
If you dance around the money I prefer you hire dancers
Preferably someone
I can teach the english language to
Preferably some girl famous
Who's gon' make me famous too
That's a joke, no its not
Girl I'm drunk

If you ain't talkin' real shit

[Refrain: Russ]
Crazy shit
Groupies go from local hoes to famous chicks
I've been circling around hollywood
Takin' way more meetings than I probably should

[Verse 2: Russ]
Got some songs on television
Yeah, that re-run check is nice I just gave my mom a stack
I just re-upped with like five
I just had Menage Trois
With a Saudi and Latina
Yeah, they keep me on my toes
All I date is ballerinas
All these labels on my phone, woah
Put the money up, Groupies on my phone, woah
What y'all talkin' 'bout
Had to change my number
Had to add another line
For the ones who do not have it
You were probably wasting time

[Bridge: Russ]
Don't waste my time

Don't waste my time
You ain't got no mutha fuckin' girls thats hot?
Woah woah don't waste my time
You ain't got no muthafuckin' money waitin' for me when I come?
