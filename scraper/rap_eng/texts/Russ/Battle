[Intro: Russ, Bugus & (Dartlin)]
Hey
Damn
That man Dartlin just doin' bad shit
(To a bitch)
That man Bugus is back here doin' some bad shit
Smokin' blunts, fuckin' bitches
Ayye
Yeah man, we're all doin' some bad shit so fuck off
Gettin' money nigga, throw it up

[Verse 1: Russ]
Uh, I was 15 comin' home from school and makin' beats
The lessons that they taught me didn't make it past my seats
So I, taught myself how to multiply my wealth
Add up all my talent and subtract what others felt
Cause I don't need that feedback
Just need that weed sack
Never been to rehab
But I'm feeling like I relapsed
Cause I'm high off life
And college wasn't right for me
Dropped out to blow up
Cause my knowledge needs the right to breathe
And yeah I battle with myself on the daily
And yeah I'm rattled by myself is what saved me
Cause I'm not cattle so I won't behave see
Imprisoned by society is the modern form of slavery
So I got out and sought out what I dreamed of
Then I got a team, plus the means and drew a scheme of
To feel alive everyday and get our green up
Snoozin' while I'm movin' so no wonder why your feet stuck

[Hook: Russ]
We battle all the time
I win and lose no matter what
My mind's so rattled cause it's me verse me
And I won't budge
But I'm alive everyday
I feel alive everyday

[Verse 2: Bugus]
Uh, the beat knocks
The beat won't drop
I rose to my feet
You know the heat won't stop
But I'll leave you niggas rattled
If you bitches wanna' battle
Cracked with a bottle
Leave you leakin' like Seattle
I'm outlandish
Can't stand this
Can't damage
My plan is to paint and create on my canvas
My Porsche screamin' yolo
In the court pleadin' Nolo
In the corner sittin' solo
Yeah, I'm dolo blowin' jolo gin
Hoes like Manolo
Get a pose in my photo
My folks know my ring froze
It glows like I'm Frodo
You hoes are Manolo
Meaning that I'm Scarface
Rich ass immigrant
Rich ass cigar taste
My flow game, propane
Cocaine, gold chain
No pain, no gain
You no names, so lame
It's B-U, G-U
I ain't gotta' finish, I'm in it
My windows are tinted
So I ain't gotta' see you

[Hook: Russ]
We battle all the time
I win and lose no matter what
My mind's so rattled cause it's me verse me
And I won't budge
But I'm alive everyday
I feel alive everyday

[Verse 3: Dartlin]
Uh, finding your soul is like mining for gold
A reminder that the time's slowly takin' it's toll
Intricate thoughts
Into the vault
But this is off
Gotta' re track my mind right back
To where I lost
Roller coastin'
Cold emotion
Roll and coatin'
This bud got me buzzed
But fuck it, I'm so focused
Stuck but hoe I'm rollin'
Remember I was goin' to Cali for college
Well now I'm out in Cali balling bitch
You acted like I didn't exist
Never imagined I had it but I got this swish
And now it's swish
Ballin' like a mu' fukka'
We just living every night like the last supper
Living it up, no giving it up
Cause shit got rough, times got hard
But we got tougher
And I've been scuffed, fell, got up
My mind got scarred
Yeah life's tough
Just smile while you suffer

[Hook: Russ]
We battle all the time
I win and lose no matter what
My mind's so rattled cause it's me verse me
And I won't budge
But I'm alive everyday
I feel alive everyday
