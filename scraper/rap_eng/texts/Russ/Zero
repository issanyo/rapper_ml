[Bridge x3: Russ]
I got my middle fingers up screaming whats up now
Real motherfuckers all around me right now

[Hook x3: Russ]

Not giving a fuck fuck
Cause I'm here to stay when you hear my name
You give it up up

[Verse 1: John Anthony]
Watchin' Lil Jojo as he in that burrow
Chop it big he hold it like a bow and arrow
Chopper God he hold that shit like he pharaoh

Nah but for real sometimes you just gotta take a vacation
Take a vacation from yourself
Make sure you spend your own time doing all the things you would like to do
Thank ya
