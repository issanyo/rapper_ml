[Verse 1: Russ]
Okay, I was flying solo
Then I saw you, woah
Girl ever since I found you I don't hear them other bitches cause they so so, mmmm
Imma' take you on an island
All I really need is timin'
Mix a little Tanqueray with your love, got me feeling all warm inside
Cause you look so good
Make me wanna' spend it all on you
Imma' take that stress off your shoulders
Put it on me, it's no longer on you (yeah)
Baby, I brought you in my ride just to have a conversation
Really think you need some ventilation
Let's talk about you and me

[Hook: Russ]
Oh, I can't believe it
Oh oh, she all on me (on me)
Now I think she want me (want me)
Now I can't leave her lonely (naw)
Oh, I can't believe it
Oh oh, she all on me (on me)
Now I think she want me (want me)
Now I can't leave her lonely (naw)

[Refrain: Russ]
Man, you don't understand she make me always say, yeeaahh, yeeaahh, yeeaahh
We hit the bed then always, always make her say, yeeaahh, yeeaahh, yeeaahh

[Verse 2: Russ]
Now we can sit here and argue
But are you gonna' fall through?
Cause I feel a little lost inside, and I need you
Pick up, when I call you
Now, stop running your mouth
And just give me your mile
And if that dude comes flexin', Imma' show him what this boss shits about
Cause you look so good
Make me wanna' spend it all on you
Imma' take that stress off your shoulders
Put it on me, it's no longer on you (yeah)
Girl, I brought you in my world just to show you what it could be
Really think us is what it should be
Let's talk about you and me

[Hook: Russ]
Oh, I can't believe it
Oh oh, she all on me (on me)
Now I think she want me (want me)
Now I can't leave her lonely (naw)
Oh, I can't believe it
Oh oh, she all on me (on me)
Now I think she want me (want me)
Now I can't leave her lonely (naw)

[Refrain: Russ]
Man, you don't understand she make me always say, yeeaahh, yeeaahh, yeeaahh
We hit the bed then always, always make her say, yeeaahh, yeeaahh, yeeaahh
