This gon' be the single parent anthem
Fellas get ya hands up
Ladies get ya hands up
This gon' be the single parent anthem
Y'all deserve a standing oath
And just scream out
Oh ey-hey
Oh-oh ey-hey
Oh-oh ey-hey yeh yeh

[Verse 1: Russ]
Okay, you're twenty with a baby
But your babies daddys just a junky
Fucking nickels, selling dimes
You wish you had twenty-twenty hindsight
But you thought the times right
To give up all your weed
All your drinking
All your hoes
All your night life
But you still fight like 24/7
Your mom told you leave him
Right before she went to heaven
And your dad from Dubai told you
Get an abortion
You both had a child, take him to court
He ain't supportin'
But you just in school tryna' make the deans list
Lookin' at your son like I'm just tryna' feed him
Breathe in breathe out (ss-hah, ss-hah)
You need gin you need loud (ss-hah, ss-hah)

[Hook: Russ]
This gon' be the single parent anthem
Fellas get ya hands up
Ladies get ya hands up
This gon' be the single parent anthem
Y'all deserve a standing oath
And just scream out
Oh ey-hey
Oh-oh ey-hey
Oh-oh ey-hey yeh yeh

[Verse 2: Russ]
Now what if the babies momma's crazy
And you a dad on your shit though
But you don't wanna wake up the crazy insider her
So you tip toe
Cause she gotta' mean bite
Like a pit bull
She's bringing out the crazy in you
Got you going schizo
But you're 33 with three kids
There's a bigger picture
You want full custody
Just flip the finger
But she's vile in motion
You startin' to lose hope 'n
Runnin' outta' money barely floatin'
Plus you feelin' bitter 'bout your past then your family
Excommunicated from your uncles and your aunties
Feeling like, y'all don't understand me
I don't need charity
I just need justice and some clarity

Oh-oh ey-hey
Oh-oh ey-hey yeh yeh
