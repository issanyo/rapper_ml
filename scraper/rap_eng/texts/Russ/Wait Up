Intro (John Anthony)
Young humble young
Ugly

Verse 1 (John Anthony)
They say kick it like Pelé
Southwest, southwest, young nigga smoking bless
Young nigga kick it right or they won’t tune in
Don’t spend it like these boys and d-boys on lines like corduroys
Smokin, posted, chillin in the back watching zombies, vampires
This club horror, movie my grind, the glory, the story, my diet
Hot fries and 40s and dreams, no wonder that I’m losing weight
This impatience, smoking looking at these skyscrapers
[?] List of gold, chillin on Garica Vegas
I’m heavy, we getting major
I’m ready to throw the flagrant to that coupe convertible
Call that shit my misbehavior
But for now I got this hope on me
Dreams in the bar and some dranks on me
Smoking God pack, the cloud under my feet
These lines they on her tongue the world under my thumb

Hook  x2 (Russ)
You’re gunna have to wait up
It’s coming sooner than you think
I’m glad you stayed up
Or rather stayed down
Cuz when you wake up
You might have slept through all the memories
So wait up, wait up

Verse 2 (John Anthony)
Just quit on me today
It would be easier to pay for social role call
Cuz Johnny go hard like acid rehabs and alcoholic
One drunk too much chronic
South Atlanta throwing boot cases to the single scholars and
Baby mommas who hate
M.O.B. Just get yo J.O.B
And feed me like a mayor heat
Drankin like it’s C’est la vie
Or [?]
She say, “See me on tomorrow.”
Dick called God without the seven [?] sorrow
Only time I ain’t the one thinkin bout tomorrow
She so close minded that she thinkin bout her wardrobe
Before though, uh
Living on Gordon
[?] on the grind, she think it’s kill time
On the corner standing with a, “I need a deal,” sign
Loud pack louder than a fuckin field mine

Hook  x2 (Russ)
You’re gunna have to wait up
It’s coming sooner than you think
I’m glad you stayed up
Or rather stayed down
Cuz when you wake up
You might have slept through all the memories
So wait up, wait up
