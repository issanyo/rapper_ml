[Introduction]
I'm trippin

[Instrumental]

[Interlube]
The thoughts are not just like these, uh, whimsical things that have no weight and carry no weight
Because your thoughts are things
Your thoughts are, like, the only way you feel

[Instrumental]

[Interlube]
A lot of people don't know that the law of attraction goes hand in hand with the law of detatchment
You know what I'm saying?
People think like, oh ok, like
You just gotta think about it and it'll come to you
But in all reality
You gotta let go of that thought into the universe for it to come back to you

[Outro]
