[Hook: Russ]
Fresh like a breeze in the sauna
I can get whatever when I wanna
Tryna get around and be on the
Candy that's around Willy Wonka
I like to go where my body got candy

[Verse 1: Russ]
I don't wanna talk right now
Everytime we do you're hot and cold
You know what it is when the boss in town
It don't really matter cause I got more hoes
But I'm tryna focus on the task at hand
But these Spanish chicks gotta hex on me
I'm just looking at em' like, damn I'm the man
Make me wanna mmm, mmm, mmm unleash

[Hook: Russ]
Fresh like a breeze in the sauna
I can get whatever when I wanna
Tryna get around and be on the
Candy that's around Willy Wonka
I like to go where my body got candy

[Verse 2: Paulina]
I'd love to get to know you, love to choose the same two things all the time
But little girl is broken, hop off my dick, just
If you wanna get with me you've gotta move to the way that my hips thrust
I don't fall for the most ones
If it's paid then I'll love you in the rain, but, I won't know how to guide three so happy (drownin in candy)

[Hook: Russ]
Fresh like a breeze in the sauna
I can get whatever when I wanna
Tryna get around and be on the
Candy that's around Willy Wonka
I like to go where my body got candy

[Refrain: Jafe]
I'm a cavity to your cavalry of love
Got you spell bound
So sweet, for one of hell's hounds
So sugar coat me in your energy
Sugar coat me in your energy

[Hook: Russ]
Fresh like a breeze in the sauna
I can get whatever when I wanna
Tryna get around and be on the
Candy that's around Willy Wonka
I like to go where my body got candy
