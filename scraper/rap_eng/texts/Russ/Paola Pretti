[Intro]
I got to know, got to know, got to know now
Girl, I

[Verse 1]
We drink like it’s annointed liquor
I see you got your hands full, pointin' fingers
I’m just tryin' to figure out
If it’s a broom that you flew in on
'Cause I’m tryin' to break you out
So I'm not the one to be goin' in on
Flick on enlightenment
Why don’t you try this shit?
'Cause every time I try you end up fightin' it
Phone calls full of black holes and white flags
I put you first so you might last
Just gimme a sec

[Chorus]
Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
That I’m feelin'?
Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
That I’m feelin'?
I wanna know, ah na na no
Throw my cards on your table

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I told you I was all in right?
You bluffed once and didn’t think twice
But I'm not the type to fold a hand
You say it's the Beetles, me, and 2Pac
I gotta hold your hand to keep your head up

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
I’m willing and able

[Verse 3]
To be everything
You say you feel it
But little did I know
About the lies you were concealin'
Now the truth comes out
And all hell breaks loose
When the goose comes out
Or better yet tequila mixed with all your pride
And your anger
But you feelin' like a stranger when you sober
So drink up and let me get closer, fuck

[Chorus]
Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
That I’m feelin'?
Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
That I’m feelin'?
I wanna know, ah na na no
