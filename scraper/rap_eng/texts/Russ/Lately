[Hook: Russ]
Okay lately
I been watching people get lost
And lately
People really don't know what they want
That's cause lately
People out here lying to themselves
So lately
Society got yo' soul on the shelf (some people need help)

[Verse 1: Russ]
Turn my back on society, seventeen
Cause they told me that I couldn't have a dream
But I got it, dropped out of college, MTV
Now I'm all over the world on yo screen
Now I'm front cover like girls on magazines
Now I'm chopped not slopped, shoutout OG Run C
Now I'm on the radio in Seattle
Now I'm out in Belgium, I don't even travel
Oooo what happened?

[Verse 2: Bugus]
I'm watchin' people give up
Contemplating suicide
Tryna' tell my people we much smarter when we unify
Tryna' move these units, out here livin' like it's do or die
We be on MTV, often dreams is self belief
Got my confidence, my self esteem is shootin' through the roof
Imma' stay inside my house, lock myself inside my booth
Got my gin, I got my juice
Got my family to balance me
I don't need no rules
Imma' boss, watch the world spin off

[Refrain: Russ + Musa]
Okay lately, I been on the block sellin' crazy
This nine to five job ain't gon' save me
I gotta' keep a Glock for my safety
I almost fucked around and had a baby
