[Verse 1: Russ]
I brought you to my world
I thought you were the girl for me
But you threw it all away
Drinking all this liquor
Just to wash the pain away from me

[Pre-Hook 1: Russ]
It's not for you anymore
No, it's not for you anymore
It's not for you anymore

[Hook: Emmanuel Davis]
That feeling, that doesn't go away just did
That feeling, that doesn't go away just did

[Verse 2: Russ]
Yeah, you know I love you
But what am I supposed to do?
Cause you fucked me over
So I don't trust you
This is too much

[Pre-Hook: Russ]
It's not for you anymore
It's not for you anymore

[Refrain: Russ]
I believed in you

[Pre-Hook: Russ]
It's not for you anymore
It's not for you anymore

[Hook: Emmanuel Davis]
That feeling, that doesn't go away just did
That feeling, that doesn't go away just did
That feeling, that doesn't go away just did
That feeling, that doesn't go away just did

[Verse 3: Russ]
I was ready for you
You weren't ready for me, no, no, no
I was ready for you
And you weren't ready for me no, no, no

[Hook: Emmanuel Davis]
That feeling, that doesn't go away just did
That feeling, that doesn't go away just did

[Verse 4: Russ]
Yeah, I operate off love, not fear
What it is ain't what it was
You know, you know, you know, you know

[Hook: Emmanuel Davis]
That feeling, that doesn't go away just did
That feeling, that doesn't go away just did
