[Intro: Russ]
Yeah
On vacation
Yo Boog, I figured this shit out yo

[Verse 1: Russ]
Ok, I'm chillin' reading Deepak
Listen to my beats knock
Picking up where the legends left off, like I'm 3Pac
Scrollin' through my contacts tryna' find Jesus
Blue skies and Cognac, paintin' Mona Lisa's
While tryna' fight amnesia
No structure to my routine, just rubbers
New queen, no lover
Blue dream and Lucy in the sky
That was summer of my college days
I got to say, I miss you
But now I'm doing shows in some of the schools I couldn't get into
As I flip through, these pages in a book of
My life, roll some kush up
I might never look up
These lights got me shook up
Tonight time to cook up
Will dope get ya' hook up
What's hope without good luck
I need that, didn't I agree that
If you don't give it up, imma' put the ski mask on
And come up to yo' do' with that what up, what up
Come up to yo' do' with that what up, what up

[Hook: Darondo]
Didn't I treat you right, now?
(Didn't I?)
Didn't I do the best I could?
(Didn't I?)
Didn't I give you everything?
(Didn't I?)
I tried my best just to be a man
(Didn't I?)

[Verse 2: Russ]
Right now I got two friends, Miles Davis and Jack Daniels
Tryna' put my life together, without any manuals
Listenin' to these rain drops, without ever really tryin'
It's part of what I know, what I know is I'm survivin'
So let me hear that saxophone
Embarrassed to ever rap at home
Afraid my parents gonna hear me so
I go outside and pack a bowl
Let me drown my worries, in a cup that's made of promise
I used to have a light bulb, but now I'm feelin' Amish
And I used to be in college but the shoes never fit me
So now I'm making beats from my class in the city
You ain't fuckin' with me, excuse me while I compensate
Over what I need to, yeah sometimes I over complicate
Like simple things in life, so much it's hard to concentrate
Like I ain't I got the juice
But I know, I know I do
I'm trippin' off my stature and my future got me loose
Yeah, I'm trippin' off my stature and my future got me loose

[Hook: Darondo]
Didn't I treat you right, now?
(Didn't I?)
Didn't I do the best I could?
(Didn't I?)
Didn't I give you everything?
(Didn't I?)
I tried my best just to be a man
(Didn't I?)

[Refrain: Russ]
Ok, I'm sippin' on that fuck you, rollin' up that might as well
I said I'm sippin' on that fuck you, rollin' up that might as well
And I put my life behind the bars, like I died in jail
And I put my life behind the bars, like I died in jail

[Hook: Darondo]
Didn't I treat you right, now?
(Didn't I?)
Didn't I do the best I could?
(Didn't I?)
Didn't I give you everything?
(Didn't I?)
I tried my best just to be a man
(Didn't I?)
