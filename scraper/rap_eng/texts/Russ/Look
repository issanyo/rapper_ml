Look around me baby, all you see is cash
Look who's laughing now, they always used to laugh
Look who's winning and upgraded from the past
Just look, just look, yeah yeah
Look at my life, look at your life, look at my bank account
Look at me work, look at me prosper, look at me make it out
Look at me glow, look at me glisten, look at me stunt on you
This is for the ones in your life who know they ain't got nothin on you

[Verse 1]
I just made a million dollars in two weeks
I just bought my mom a car for cash, I told em fuck a lease
Look at me:
Blocked your dream girl, she was tweakin'
Nah we weren't dating, just fuckin' for the weekend
You was tripping, I was dipping
You caught feelings, I didn't
Smash Mouth life, swear I'm feelin' like an All Star
Went and told my momma you ain't gotta shop at Wal-Mart no more

[Hook]
Look around me baby, all you see is cash
Look who's laughing now, they always used to laugh
Look who's winning and upgraded from the past
Just look, just look, yeah yeah
Look at my life, look at your life, look at my bank account
Look at me work, look at me prosper, look at me make it out
Look at me glow, look at me glisten, look at me stunt on you
This is for the ones in your life who know they ain't got nothin on you

[Verse 2]
Millionaire before a label, that's called leverage
All the real ones gon' relate
All the fake ones gon' get jealous
Look at me:
Flew your wife out she forgot her wedding band
Gettin' so much money I forgot I spent like 20 bands today
Flip tricks, but I don't play X Games
I been traveling, currency exchange
A year rent, that's what the set pays
Fantasy girls get turned into sex slaves
That's a light flex, cash when i speak that's a mic check
You sitting down, I suggest that you stand up
In Russ they trust, whole world got they hands up, look

[Hook]
Look around me baby, all you see is cash
Look who's laughing now, they always used to laugh
Look who's winning and upgraded from the past
Just look, just look, yeah yeah
Look at my life, look at your life, look at my bank account
Look at me work, look at me prosper, look at me make it out
Look at me glow, look at me glisten, look at me stunt on you
This is for the ones in your life who know they ain't got nothin on you
