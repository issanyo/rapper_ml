[Hook: Russ]
Who would of thought that you can be lonely, in Times Square?
I never thought that I could be lonely in, Times Square
But I've been dealing with some pain, and these distractions just ain't enough
All this liquor, all this fucking, all these people, just ain't enough

[Verse 1: Russ]
I've been feeding off my ego, I thinks it's time I starved it
As far as my journey is concerned atleast I started, fuck y'all
I'm the only one I see, I'm my biggest target
My dreams got jumpers, go ahead and try and guard it
But regardless, I'm splashing, in a pool of potential
It starts in your head, that's why I play this shit mental
Fuck your credentials, real squad running through this shit
DIEMON in this mutha' fukka' we all running through this bitch

[Verse 2: Russ]
Addiction starts with pain ends with pain too
I used you as my drug
But when your high wore off, I started throwing shots, then you started throwing them too
And I'll admit, I started-ed the pain was so real but now we've been bruised
But I ain't got time to grieve, the whole family tryna' eat
Let me take another shot, and let me fuck you like I need

[Outro x2: Russ]
You could be the truth, in me (yeah)
I could be the truth, in you (but we don't see, we don't see)
