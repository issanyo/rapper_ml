[Chorus]
I kill the weaker me make a stronger me
Somebody's gotta die
I kill the weaker me make a stronger me
Somebody's gotta die
Suicide Suicidal
Suicide Suicidal

[VERSE]
I'd rather feel pain
I'd rather see growth
Imma handle my shit
I never stay the same
I only see go
Imma handle my shit
Oooh damn I feel myself
Never woulda thought
I'd kill myself
Break me down to reveal myself
At the end of it all I'm still myself
Better version wiser person
All around stronger person

[Chorus]
I kill the weaker me make a stronger me
Somebody's gotta die
I kill the weaker me make a stronger me
Somebody's gotta die
Suicide Suicidal
Suicide Suicidal

[VERSE 2]
I'd rather feel pain
I'd rather see growth
Imma handle my shit
I never stay the same
I only see go
Imma handle my shit
Oooh damn everything I want
On the other side of the pain I don't want
Can't hide from the pain gotta run to it
Train your motherfuckin brain get numb to to it

[Chorus]
I kill the weaker me make a stronger me
Somebody's gotta die
I kill the weaker me make a stronger me
Somebody's gotta die
Suicide Suicidal
Suicide Suicidal
