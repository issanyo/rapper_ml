[Intro: Russ]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, mm-mmm

[Verse 1: Russ]
Yeah
Hey, Gianna fuck them bitches cause they ain't shit
You gonna' laugh in all they faces when I'm famous buying Rangers for you
I would die, I would kill, I would grab a stainless for you
Fuck around and end up doing something fucking brainless for you
Cause people doing 180°s, constantly turning
I'm sipping Tanqueray constantly swerving, learning
Constantly earning, but yearning
For some better shit
I took the life that I was handed, flipped the script
And then embellished it
I'm the president

[Refrain: Russ]
Fan, player, and the coach
Don't forget about the owna'
I know bullshit when I smell it
All of y'all got the aroma
But I swear I'm coming soona'
Then a bitch in Oklahoma
Self-belief could be the drug that could get you off the corna'
But you been sleeping on yourself for so long that you're in a coma
So it's feeling like it's ova'
And your baby mama hate you
The Devil's at your door
But your kid motivates you
Cause what starts as a mistake, could be the same shit that saves you

[Verse 2: Russ]
Who would of thought?
You could of popped, you could of been me
Excuse me for my arrogance, but I was just on MTV
Plus labels wanna' sign me, so I'm out in NYC
Fuck the politics, got a lotta' chicks, out in DC
Fuck 'em with the campaign
Every night there's champagne
Bottles pop, me and Bugus, lions that you can't tame
Went from getting set up, to setting up set list
Everyday I wake up to a check on my checklist
I could buy a necklace just to say I own it
But I'd rather buy a breakfast for my mom, I'm out here making moments
That's the main component
Talking to myself, like "it pays don't it?"
Mutha' fukkas' wanna' be me, that's when they hate on 'em
But I don't pay attention, they're not real to me
I got a Puerto Rican chick that keeps it real with me
This is real easy, to dismantle y'all
Y'all turning into actors, just because the camera's on
But Russ is what it sounds like when the mutha' fukkas' cameras off
I said, Russ is what it sounds like when the mutha' fukkas' cameras off
One more time
I said, Russ is what it sounds like when the mutha' fukkas' cameras off
(Yeeaahh)
Yeah
Ok, lack of self-belief, that's the number one disease
Out here killing everybody, better hold on to your dreams, mutha' fukka'
And what it is, ain't what it seems, mutha' fukka'
I mean, sometimes it is
But you gotta' kill your ego, If you wanna live

[Hook: Nate Dogg] See me man, I'm nothin' like you
Got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
Leaning in my ride, fo' fifth, cock banging
Me, I'm riding by you, on the corner block slanging
Livin' that boss' life
Girls come running when they see me coming
Livin' that boss' life
You can have anything, just don't touch my money

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
From a world of poverty (b-o-s-s)
To the front page of magazines (l-i-f-e)
Oooo, we boss'
Feeling so good, feeling so good, it feels so good (feels good)
A boss' life
Wantin' shoes on my feet (b-o-s-s)
To riding 'round in limousines  (l-i-f-e)
Oooo, we boss'
Feeling so good, feeling so good, it feels so good (feels good)
A boss' life
