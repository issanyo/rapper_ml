VERSE 1
Imma do my thing and never let you tie me up
Jewels drippin' off my lips I'm sippin' from a diemon (diamond) cup
Spit & gold-plate the world the day they ever turn me up
Let these slaves know their kings til these demons burn me up
On this worldly plane, GROWN MAN, don't mix with boys playin girly games
TOO BUSY, making sure the world know my name
Who & what I stand for & how far we came
I don't want yo car, don't want yo broad, don't want Versace chains
I got these brains & I ain't get em from no bad bitch
Mama taught me better, she was never thinkin' average
And me I'm like a laid back savage & this is payback bastards
I'm on my way back from a place that they can't say they've traveled
While they stay at gravel, tough to unravel
Things that your mind has never thought about
But I'm young black & gifted had to sort it out
Ask myself about what I see & whats this all about it
"& is this what it's all about?"
Well FUCK THAT its time to call a route
I call a audible. I made this audio for all of you
Lookin' or not even lookin' for your callin' while life has been callin' you
This ain't a dance song or a trance song
Its a get off yo ass & take a stand song
DO YO THING & STAND STRONG!
& maybe one day you'll stand where you belong
...cause Imma do my thing

Bridge (SQUiRE Speaks)
"but really man, STOP LIVING JUST TO IMITATE. OR LIVING BECAUSE OF WHAT PEOPLE WOULD THINK OR WHAT THEY WON'T THINK OF YOU; OR NOT LIVING BECAUSE OF WHAT PEOPLE THINK. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN? OR FEAR OF WHAT PEOPLE WILL THINK MAN JUST DO YOUR THING. & THAT THING YOU FELT INSIDE SINCE YOU WERE A KID JUST DO IT! DONT LET OTHER PPL INFLUENCE IT MAN...& THATS REAL SHIT. SQUIREVILLE...LETS GO BACK."

VERSE 2
Feedin' into critics is like 3am & you feedin' a gremlin
You creatin' a monster they all got opinions
Life's about decisions not what you think about it
But that you think about it before you be about it
You might not got sight...but you need vision, you can't see without it
& you can't lead without it
But every followers gotta lead himself if no one else
So go and get yours if no one helps
Cause usually no one helps....DO YOUR THING
