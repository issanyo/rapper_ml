[Verse 1: Russ]
I need crazy bitch thats down for me
I need a little something wild and free
I need the right amount of attitude
She checks herself but she checks me too
I need her to reciprocate all my love
Get drunk with me even if she loves blunts
Baby bring that accent out for me
I need a crazy bitch thats down for me

[Hook: Russ]
Cuz baby I'll be down for you
I promise I'll be down for you
Even when I'm not around
Somwhere outta town
I promise I'll be down for you

[Verse 2: Russ]
I need a crazy bitch thats down for me
But not the type of crazy that don't let me breath
Baby fall back I'm executing Gods moves
That's just in my blood
That's just how a God moves
Hope you understand and you catch my wave
Hope you know you're bad as fuck but not too vain
I need someone who really loves me for me
I need a crazy bitch thats down for me

[Hook: Russ]
Cuz baby I'll be down for you
I promise I'll be down for you
Even when I'm not around
Somwhere outta town
I promise I'll be down for you

[Verse 3: Russ]
I need a crazy bitch thats down for me
She's a movie star without the screen
I don't need you with me if you gonna be impulsive
I don't need no selfish inconsiderate bullshit
I don't need your mouth running when it's not called for
I don't need your text what the fuck you think I called for
Ask yourself what you really wanna be
I need a crazy bitch thats down for me

[Hook: Russ]
Cuz baby I'll be down for you
I promise I'll be down for you
Even when I'm not around
Somwhere outta town
(I need a crazy bitch thats down for me)
Cuz baby I'll be down for you
I promise I'll be down for you
Even when I'm not around
Somwhere outta town
(I need a crazy bitch thats down for me)
