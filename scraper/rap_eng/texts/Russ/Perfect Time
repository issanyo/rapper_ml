[Intro: Russ]
(You you you you)

[Chorus: Toni Romiti]
You came into my life at a perfect time
Oh, you may not be perfect but I know you're tryin'
Oh, you came into my life at a perfect time
Oh, you may not be perfect but I know you're tryin'
For me

[Post-Chorus: Toni Romiti]
(You you you you)
(You you you you)
So tell me what it is that you want from me
(You you you you)
(You you you you)
So tell me what it is– is–

[Verse 1: Russ]
I know that I act up, tryna put it past us
I just need to calm down, I just need a backrub
I was introduced and I ain't on the same shit
I was close to losin' everythin' I came with (yo)
Then I found you, my round two, my second chance
I stepped on your feet at first, I'mma need me a second dance
Bachata, possibly vodka, I see you tryin', I love it
I'm trying my hardest too
I love you, I might as well cuff it

[Chorus: Toni Romiti]
You (yeah) came into my life at a perfect time
Oh, you may not be perfect but I know you're tryin'
Oh, you came into my life at a perfect time
Oh, you may not be perfect but I know you're tryin'
For me

[Post-Chorus: Toni Romiti]
(You you you you)
(You you you you)
So tell me what it is that you want from me
(You you you you)
(You you you you)
So tell me what it is– is–

[Verse 2: Toni Romiti]
You stay down, straight ten toes
We make love then make dough
I got a better nigga now, this is what I prayed for
I won't ever play with you
Always keep it straight with you
When you're outta love, get super low
I will always try to save you
When you need some head, some peace of mind, I'm your sanity
When I spread my legs in your bed, I'm your masterpiece
Arch my back, look back- it's fat
Oh, when I move it to the music
It all comes naturally (oh)
And it's all because of...

[Chorus: Toni Romiti]
You came into my life at a perfect time
Oh, you may not be perfect but I know you're tryin'
Oh, you (you) came into my life at a perfect time
Oh, you may not be perfect but I know you're tryin'
For me

[Post-Chorus: Toni Romiti]
(You you you you)
Oh, for me
(You you you you)
So tell me what it is that you want from me
(You you you you)
(You you you you)
So tell me what it is– is–
(You you you you)
(You you you you)
(You you you you)
