Whoa oh oh ohhhhh oh
Whoa oh oh ohhhhh oh
Whoa oh oh ohhhhh oh
Whoa oh oh ohhhhh oh

Yeah, you feelin' trapped
Both your parents left you
Momma's in Columbia
Daddy don't respect you
So you been a gypsy
Since you were like 16
Yeah, you been homeless
Affects you in ways you don't notice
Goin' through the motions
No one there to guide you
Go ahead light the weed
Play some shit that you can ride to
Never lettin' out
What's really deep inside you
But baby I can slide through
I can help you find you

Whoa oh oh ohhhhh oh
Whoa oh oh ohhhhh oh
Whoa oh oh ohhhhh oh
Whoa oh oh ohhhhh oh

Now you finally found someone
Who loves you just for who you are
Knows that you've been through some shit
Knows that you've been pushed too far
Still he's trying to pull you
Otherwise you back up
Cause your self conscious is fuckin' up
Tell that bitch "back up"
But you continue like a nomad to the next house
Moved in with the dude so he can trust you
Yeah, he left now
Lookin' for the blame
Quit playin' the role of a victim
Be the products of your thoughts
Not a product of the system
Got me sayin'

Whoa oh oh ohhhhh oh
Whoa oh oh ohhhhh oh
Whoa oh oh ohhhhh oh
Whoa oh oh ohhhhh oh
