[Chorus]
Climb on top, feels like we’re on drugs
You say it’s that dope, I just call it loving
Then I climb on top, fuck you like you need
Me on top is cool but I really want you on top of me

[Verse 1]
We fuck and we fight but not in that order
I love you tonight, I hate you by morning
These drugs on the table got me talking too much
You getting offended, not giving two fucks
Dirty hotel, you call it ‘The Trap’
I’m not gonna front, I’m still coming back
Short tempers, long distance, so we fuck through the phone like it’s prison (so we fuck through the phone like it’s prison)

[Chorus]
Climb on top, feels like we’re on drugs
You say it’s that dope, I just call it loving
Then I climb on top, fuck you like you need
Me on top is cool but I really want you on top of me

[Verse 2]
We living in hell, I was showing you heaven
You are far from an angel and close to a blessing
You went up to Michigan sucking some dick again
Swimmin' in bottles and blunts and lies
Your life jacket was my sympathy, my naivety
And now you dying drowning, you try to bring me down, too
You were barely floating when I found you
Paddle quick, paddle quick, paddle quick
I be grabbing billions you be grabbing dicks
What’s up, you were lying, your looks like a hoe
And you ain’t gonna ever, ever, ever again

[Chorus]
Climb on top, feels like we’re on drugs
You say it’s that dope, I just call it loving
Then I climb on top, fuck you like you need
Me on top is cool but I really want you on top of me

[Bridge]
And you might be thinking that you might have got me
Oh, but don’t you ever, for a second, think I didn’t see
I just knew that you couldn’t hurt me
Maybe I was a little too color blind, fuck it
