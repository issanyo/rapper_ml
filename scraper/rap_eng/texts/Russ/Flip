[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
Keep that same energy, please don't flip
You were talking all that motherfucking shit
We see everyone, we been keeping a list

[Chorus]
Keep that same energy, please don't flip
Please don't flip, please don't flip
Please don't flip, please don't flip
Please don't flip, please don't flip
Keep that same energy, please don't flip (yeah)

[Verse 1]
People hating on me, that's a trend
Big Tim gonna deck you, that's a friend
Peep my middle finger, that's a Benz
All my women mixed, that's a blend
Blow a 100k, I don't feel a thing, let me pop my shit
People coming at me from all angles, gotta watch my six (woah)
Y'all are checking scores (woah)
I'm just scoring checks (woah)
Y'all say less is more (woah)
Put that myth to rest
Ain't no flipping back and forth, stay the fuck away from me
You can't get a beat, a hook, a verse, a fucking WAV for me
I see all the hate for me, I been keeping inventory
If we run into each other, please don't switch your story

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep that same energy, please don't flip (yeah)
You were talking all that motherfucking shit (bitch)
We see everyone, we been keeping a list (we all see)

[Chorus]
Keep that same energy, please don't flip (yeah)
Please don't flip, please don't flip
Please don't flip, please don't flip
Please don't flip, please don't flip
Keep that same energy, please don't flip (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Talking and being broke, that's all y'all are good for
Mad 'cause your bookkeepers keep saying you need to get booked more
Your lack of success is not my fault, with your crying ass
Spreading rumors 'bout me, bitch you reaching with your lying ass
Price, I just swipe, its been two years since I've looked
If you hate but you follow, you're a fan, that's understood
You got million dollar goals, but your work ethic's a penny
I take trips around the world, you still taking trips to Denny's
That's your budget? That's so sad, you're like thirty and some change
If you're hating, just be patient, I got way more on the way
You so salty that I'm popping, my success is pepper spray
Pick a side, pick a side, once you pick it better stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep that same energy, please don't flip (yeah)
You were talking all that motherfucking shit (yeah)
We see everyone, we been keeping a list (we see you too)

[Chorus]
Keep that same energy, please don't flip
Please don't flip, please don't flip
Please don't flip, please don't flip
Please don't flip, please don't flip
Keep that same energy, please don't flip
