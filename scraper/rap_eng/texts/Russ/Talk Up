[Intro: Russ]
Tell you how
Tell you how to do it
I tell you how to do it
Yuh

[Verse 1: Russ]
Ok, your boy's a frequent flyer now
Gettin' a little bit of money
So I might be looking flyer now
Quite down, Russ is talkin'
I mean Russ is chompin'
You catch fleas when you lay with bitches
Way to often
I just dog 'em
Keep it movin'
Flippin' thoughts into fruition
I just sold out shows in Europe
With no label, no booking agent
No manager, no publicist
Just me, myself, and all my visions
And self belief and passion
And a little persistence
I know some people
That know some people
That can get you fucked up
If you don't keep your distance
So homie keep your distance
I got my kin wit' me, kinkle me
Pretty bitches that sing for me
Alley-oop me the coochie
And then I'm dunkin' like Timothy
Aahhh

[Hook: Bugus]
Niggas ain't gettin' no money
Niggas ain't gettin' no dough
Wouldn't know when I'm countin' my money
Wouldn't know if a nigga went broke

[Verse 2: Russ + Bugus]
When I cop a mansion
I cop a gun for every room
Cause I know niggas campin'
And you won't catch me lampin'
Whole crew on some Ugo
Boss up
Say what?
Talk up
Birds tend to flock when I walk up
Here's my toast
I'm tryna' get bread
Get a loaf
For my squad divvy up
That's the pledge of allegiance
Unspoken agreements
If you ain't in tune, you won't peep it
Mufasa, mufasa, mufasa
All y'all sheep skin, gettin' eaten
Prayin' to Jesus, hopin' that he saves y'all
Y'all better save yourselves mutha' fukkas

[Hook: Bugus]
Niggas ain't gettin' no money
Niggas ain't gettin' no dough
Wouldn't know when I'm countin' my money
Wouldn't know if a nigga went broke
Niggas ain't gettin' no money
Niggas ain't gettin' no dough
Wouldn't know when I'm countin' my money
Wouldn't know if a nigga went broke
