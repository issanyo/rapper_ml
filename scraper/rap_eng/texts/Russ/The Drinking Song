[Verse 1: Russ]
Seeing the unknown, see me running towards it
Man chases boy, watch me as I floored it
I'm sorry, too little open cosmos
I got no rubrik, I do this blindly
Woke up to the screams of my soul saying "Find me!"
Splash some cold water on my face
Took a shot of something light
Living in and out the doors, spark plumbs get high
From a second-hand smoke in the knee, son beat up
Breathing all this gas and all my lights gonna speed up
Let the past pass, hope the future doesn't freeze up
Jesus, he's just Santa Claus to me, so it's out of two fairy'
There's some mons' in my sheets
So she better be discreet, but she's filling up my dreams
'Cause my cup is running over to the world of disbelief
And I don't need that, I leaned back, let the whisky wisp
Welcome to the edge, look around and then I enter, yeah

[Chorus: Russ]
Oh, oh, not drinking again
Oh, oh, not drinking again

[Verse 2: Russ]
Hey, I'm numb to the elymus
Enough for the medicine
I need my cup, it's feeling like I'm better than
God, whoever that is
Trying to figure out just what the path is
Past is, wanna not know
We could cover under grasses
Smash shit, flown in my mind
Parching on my soul, like a butterfly on fun
At least that's what I tell people
Ego is the relief, ego is the relief

[Chorus: Russ, Tyler]
Oh, oh, not drinking again (drinking again)
Oh, oh, not drinking again (drinking again)

[Bridge: Russ]
Hanging onto belief, my fingertips
Are so numb that I don't feel my life
Don't wake me up, I'm just rolling around
I'm just floating until I get right

[Chorus: Tyler]
Oh, oh, not drinking again
Oh, oh, not drinking again

[Outro: Tyler]
In the moment I get a little buzz
I get to feeling like a billion bucks
'Cause I'm one of a kind, every time
I'm taking the pop job, I feel I've been loved
Jack-sipping, pass it, living in my other cup
Turn it up, give it like I know the uppercup
Any time I gotta rumble with the thunder strike
'Cause like lighting, I'm deciding to roll it out like a diamond
