[HOOK]
Call a plug tell him bring a whole pound for us
Call ya girl tell her bring a whole pound of blunts
All the hate that was sent didn't amount to much
Look all we done
Ya I'm proud of us
Ya I'm proud of us
Ya I'm proud of us
Look all we done
Ya I'm proud of us
Ya I'm proud of us
Ya I'm proud of us
Look all we done
Ya I'm proud of us

[VERSE 1]
Everybody up in the club with bacardi
We were busy tryna be the soundtrack of the party
Livin under guardians buildin up an audience
Drinkin like a sailor and smokin like rastafarians
Workin each song tryna make it shake
Up so long even the moon gotta take a break
And the bottle for the night used to cost us a fortune
Copped so much gin we deserve an endorsement
I was failin these courses
I was failin them all
I was focused on music tryna give it to yall
Left college dropped out a minute
Then I got back up and I went back and finished

[HOOK]
Call a plug tell him bring a whole pound for us
Call ya girl tell her bring a whole pound of blunts
All the hate that was sent didn't amount to much
Look all we done
Ya I'm proud of us
Ya I'm proud of us
Ya I'm proud of us
Look all we done
Ya I'm proud of us
Ya I'm proud of us
Ya I'm proud of us
Look all we done
Ya I'm proud of us

[VERSE 2]
Only some of the rarest goin thru a clearance
Haters should be embarrassed these shows out in Paris
Imma be here hit go on my career
Now ya boy got more soul than South Korea
Still goin hard for this thing of ours
Come and try to play the squad
Imma catch a charge
Who else been goin hard for a decade long
Built a fanbase up that'll get they song tattooed on skin for life
Know what I do with my friends is right
I'm proud of the brilliance proud of resilience
Proud we made something that went on and made millions

[HOOK]
Call a plug tell him bring a whole pound for us
Call ya girl tell her bring a whole pound of blunts
All the hate that was sent didn't amount to much
Look all we done
Ya I'm proud of us
Ya I'm proud of us
Ya I'm proud of us
Look all we done
Ya I'm proud of us
Ya I'm proud of us

[VERSE 3]
With my dogs I just add to the kennel
Jeff Gordon of the game got my foot on the pedal
Fundamentals in my mind I'm true to what I do
Imma win win win celebrate it with the crew
We gon win win win celebrate it again
Always knew I'd be a winner ever since I was ten
Appreciate what I do cuz we dope as hell
We just do what we love and we hope it sell
We done went and beat the odds
We done broke the scales
Haters been super mad cuz they won't prevail
And when they come tell the women they can follow the smell
We been winnin it ain't hard to tell

[HOOK]
Call a plug tell him bring a whole pound for us
Call ya girl tell her bring a whole pound of blunts
All the hate that was sent didn't amount to much
Look all we done
Ya I'm proud of us
Ya I'm proud of us
Ya I'm proud of us
Look all we done
Ya I'm proud of us
Ya I'm proud of us

Look all we done
