[Intro]
Yeah
I been thinkin'
Yeah
Ooh, na na na na na na
Yeah

[Chorus]
Lately I been feelin' like I'm all alone
Hotels and airplanes is what I call home
I might need somebody, I don't trust nobody
So I guess I'm really on my own
Lately I been feelin' like I'm all alone
Hotels and airplanes is what I call home
I might need somebody, I don't trust nobody
So I guess I'm really on my own

[Verse 1]
I'll make it through any storm
No matter the weather, I do better when it's cold out
Pretty views with a lot of ugly people
The arena's the only time I ever sold out
California to clear my head
Ignorin' all my texts
Y'all don't get it anyway, anyway
Zoned out, I should put my phone down
I live on the road now
Everything's not glorious, glorious

[Chorus]
Lately I been feelin' like I'm all alone
Hotels and airplanes is what I call home
I might need somebody, I don't trust nobody
So I guess I'm really on my own
Lately I been feelin' like I'm all alone
Hotels and airplanes is what I call home
I might need somebody, I don't trust nobody
So I guess I'm really on my own

[Verse 2]
Laid up with this celebrity chick
Laughin' at the ones that said that I would never be rich
My memories lit
But I forgive you
Rich is not on the surface, nah it's in you
I been through boundaries, that's how I found me
Naturally I lost every bad friend around me
I kept the real ones, but even they can't never relate
And Bugus 'bout to blow soon, we gon' laugh at this day I hope
And every word that I spoke, yeah I mean it
And every verse that I wove, I'm the seamstress
You know it's different when your mom feels distant
You understood everything, but not this shit
It's not your fault, it's just something you gon' learn too
It's your turn for me to be the one you turn to
Role reversal, no rehearsal for this
No complaints, it's just some personal shit

[Chorus]
Lately I been feelin' like I'm all alone
Hotels and airplanes is what I call home
I might need somebody, I don't trust nobody
So I guess I'm really on my own
Lately I been feelin' like I'm all alone
Hotels and airplanes is what I call home
I might need somebody, I don't trust nobody
So I guess I'm really on my own
Lately I been feelin' like I'm all alone
Hotels and airplanes is what I call home
I might need somebody, I don't trust nobody
So I guess I'm really on my own

[Outro]
I feel all alone
Yeah
