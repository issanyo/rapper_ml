[Intro: Russ]
Don't lose it
Don't lose it now
Don't lose it
Don't lose it now

[Hook: Russ]
Keep the faith and you will see
Don't lose it
Don't lose it now

[Verse 1: Russ]
Young girl, left all alone
In a world where you need somebody
Old habits, die so hard
Bottle after bottle tryna' find somebody
And doesn't know how to cope with the baby in her stomach
So she got that coke in her nose
And her baby daddy ain't about shit
Before she opened her legs
She wish she would of known

[Hook: Russ]
Keep the faith and you will see
Don't lose it
Don't lose it now
Keep the faith and you will see
Don't lose it
Don't lose it now

[Verse 2: Russ]
Yeah and she fucks with that gangsta' hip-hop
Daddy wasn't there so she was raised by hip-hop
Impressionable
In that liquor is her confessional
Ambition so quiet
But her weed's full of decibels
Loud shit
And she ain't goin' up
Nah, she a down bitch
But her mind is so crowded with partying bullshit
Plus she got a pistol
Finger on the trigger and she can't wait to pull it
Til her daughter found it one day
Looked up, "Mommy I wanna' be like you one day"
And all it takes is one day

[Hook: Russ]
Keep the faith and you will see
Don't lose it
Don't lose it now
Keep the faith and you will see
