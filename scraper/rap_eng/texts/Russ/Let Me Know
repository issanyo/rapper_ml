[Intro: Russ]
Alright cool
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright
Yeah, I said as soon as I figure out this puzzle
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Yeah, just let it ride
Take a sip

[Verse 1: Russ]
Okay, as soon as I figure out Russ
The quicker I can figure out this puzzle that I struggle with
Penthouse dreams, basement realities
Foot up on the gas, should I pace myself gradually?
God damn, Lord
Give me a sign
Give me your words
Give me your sight
Give me your mind
Cause I'm feeling blind
Deaf and dumb
My soul is on a leash
Sayin' please let me run
With these beats I can speak to the freaks and the nuns
The rich, the poor, can't you see I'm the one?
With this real shit
And I hate to fuckin' say it, but do you feel this?

[Interlude: Instrumental]

[Verse 2: Russ]
I dream better when my eyes are open
I sleep better when my lights been awoken
Then I might leave the lights on
So you can see I'm focused
This game has a plague
So all I see is locusts
In most of you
But I just hope the world can see what I see
Hear what I hear, breathe what I breathe
It's a farfetched idea
But at least I have it yeah
At least I have it, at least I have it
Maybe I can work a little magic without the rabbit
Maybe I can turn a little passion to a palace
Cause after all
I'm standing on the 3 point line wide open
Pass the ball motherfuckers

[Interlude: Instrumental]

[Verse 3: Russ]
Before the sun comes up
I gotta' love, love, love
I stutter when I pray like
But-but-but
God, please don't take it personal
I just feel outta place
My mind is just a vehicle
I'm runnin' outta faith
Please believe I see the reason that I, that I
Keep on breathing in my freedom, that's why, that's why
I'm gratefully dead, to the life of the impossible
I never thought I'd get so high off the obstacles
I know it's gonna' pay off and these songs are gonna' be comical
When I put my mom somewhere tropical
These optical illusions keep on movin' tryin' to fuck me up
Where's the four leaf clover when you need it in this lucky cup

[Outro: Russ]
And I wonder if they party up in heaven screaming "lucky us"?
And I wonder if they party up in heaven screaming "lucky us"?
