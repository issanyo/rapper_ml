[Intro]
You hang in there little black child
Fight for your life [?]
You got lots to live for
Yes, you just hang in there

[Hook] x8
Do or die do or die
Do or die do or die

[Verse 1]
Woke up feeling dead today
Cover still all on my phone
Couple places I could chill
Zero places call me home
Some more professional
I prefer to call my own
My uncle call me crazy
Most niggas won't call at all
