I hate people who can't offer you a job
Wanna criticize ya work cuz you ain't gotta 9-5
They fail to realise that your buildin enterprise
Ya sons gone look up to and feel pride
They comin from a certain mind state I don't reside
The fear in they heart
Got they mind paralysed
I don't really give a fuck
I was never one of them guys
I was young always hated adults all of them lied
But I gotta thank em and thank em honestly
Cuz honestly they showed me what I didn't wanna be
My imagination stretched out across galaxies
Said fuck em all created all my own realities
Now the same one that you kickin outta public school
Hoppin on a private jet
Guess I'm not public dude
Always on my do for Bugus
Tryna make the separation
Always perfect execution
Baby it's just preparation
I just always had a vision
Fuck what they was talkin bout
Always focused on the mission
Nothin else to talk about
Now I'm 25 sewin seeds for my family business
Want my fam to go down like the Vanderbilt's did it
13 with ambition you gon feel frustrated
13 with ambition I just wanted to make it
13 when I wished we had a family business
Put my skill set to work and have my talent extended
When it comes to that energy I had the most of it
And my teachers at school always caught the worst of it
I just always really wished we had a family business
Had jobs but every shift I was glad to be finished
Countin other peoples money made me sick to my stomach
Not a dummy all is see is crumbs off of this money
Not a dummy swear to God I wanna own some shit
I want land I want grass I want homes and shit
I wanna give it to my son so he own some shit
And he ain't gotta be takin out loans and shit
And he ain't gotta b rentin out homes and shit
But he got homes up for rent if you want homes and shit
Now I'm really talkin shit hope I really got em pissed
Only truth comin forth while I'm drinkin this fifth
And of course Ima score Russ got the assist
Might b goin off course but I'm talkin my shit
I'm buildin mine strong
My son gon carry on
And on the day I'm gone
I leave wit you these family songs
Yo real eyes realize real lies
Fuck what they theorise one day you'll realize
Papa was in real estate
I got in the right room
Intellectual property ya Papa was a tycoon
When I turned 12 got my first summer job
I was gettin $10 for every car washed
Plus my Uncle Chris owned the whole car lot
Shit it was logical
I started washing cars at a hospital
I started off with nothin in my pocket but my hopes and my dreams
Ambition runnin thru my vein
Somethin dope in my genes
Bout to take over the business so my kids can get in it
If they wanna be in it ain't no start from beginnin
Now I'm smokin weed in front of my uncles with impunity
Who are you to judge if you don't offer opportunity
You can't even hire me and pay a decent salary
Fuck a job DIEMON.COM my own gallery
Now my son know he got the dopest parent
Pullin strings for my kingdom like Ed Sheeran
Teach him lessons lotta kids never learn
A dollar given never better than a dollar earned
It's a place of business its a place of refuge
It'll b the very first job of my nephew
Know my name on any RD like the Neptunes
Ima be the next big thing by the next June
Do it for my life
Really take this shit personal
Liquor throwin up
Still goin up vertical
That's what they fear the most
Turnin all the fur to coats
Wanna learn to live on land
Then you gotta burn the boats
Ya I gotcha back son
Teach you how to learn the ropes
Teach you how to write a check
Way before you learn to smoke
And i'm goin with you when you formin up ya LLCs
Residuals every 4 months
From my LPs
Ya thats called residual income
That's gettin paid from that old work that you did son
You lose in life a lot but sometimes you win son
Sometimes you master it and sometimes n you Dimsun
Sometimes it's fast and moments gone up in da wind son
And really even when its all lookin slim son
We all gonna win son
