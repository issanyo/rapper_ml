[Hook: Russ]
Fill my cup up full
I just wanna' do the same for you, yeah
Don't you lie to me
Let me know before I look a fool
Cause I don't know how to love you
Cause I don't know how to love you
Cause I don't know how to love you
Cause I don't know how to love you

[Verse 1: Russ]
I think life is a love song
Death is a horror flick
In between is the verses
The casket's the choruses
You say you need me the most
So I cut off my lights and let your darkness glow

[Bridge: Russ]
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, no no no no
If there's no oxygen left
I would hold my breath
I'd die for your love, yeah

[Hook: Russ]
Fill my cup up full
I just wanna' do the same for you, yeah
Don't you lie to me
Let me know before I look a fool
Cause I don't know how to love you
Cause I don't know how to love you
Cause I don't know how to love you
Cause I don't know how to love you

[Verse 2: Russ]
You say we're destined for greatness
And my eyebrows are raised cause I don't know if you'll make it
And I wasn't even looking but I found love on your lips
Yeah, I swear that I taste it, yeahh

[Bridge: Russ]
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, no no no no
If there's no oxygen left
I would hold my breath
I'd die for your love, yeah

[Hook: Russ]
Fill my cup up full
I just wanna' do the same for you, yeah
Don't you lie to me
Let me know before I look a fool
Cause I don't know how to love you
Cause I don't know how to love you
Cause I don't know how to love you
Cause I don't know how to love you
