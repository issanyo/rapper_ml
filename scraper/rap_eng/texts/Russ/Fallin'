[Intro: Derez De'Shon]
Yeah, real music, yeah
Put my soul in it so you can feel it (Yeah yeah)
Dig what the fuck I’m sayin'? (Yeah)
Yeah

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Starin’ in the mirror like, "What happened to me?"
You been starvin', ain't had nothin' to eat
And lately you been scared to fall asleep
'Cause you been havin' bad dreams of me fallin', uh

[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
Close my eyes, I see Dunk face
Swear to God, this shit hurt me
Close my eyes, I see Junk face
Then I think about Journey
Warrior like Steph Curry
Broken heart, no glue for it
I’m a bear for that porridge
Who got that drank? I’m tryna pour it up
All these drugs in my system, I might lose my mind in this bitch
Molly got a nigga geekin', I’m grindin' and shit
I get so high, so high, so high, no problem exists
Nigga dabbin' out a brick, and I put that on my bitch
Dropped a brick on my wrist, but it don't really mean shit
I wipe your nose like some Vicks, yeah
Jewelry gold like some piss, yeah yeah
My bitch so bad, she throwin’ fits
I made that dope jump like a fish
But it really don't mean shit

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Starin' in the mirror like, "What happened to me?"
You been starvin', ain't had nothin' to eat
And lately you been scared to fall asleep
'Cause you been havin' bad dreams of me fallin'

[Verse 2: Russ]
Is it too good to be true? I just hope that all this lasts
I just bought my mom a house, half a million all in cash
Passin' CD's out for free, ain't no way I'm goin' back
Fuck these feelings, this ain't me, devil keep tryna distract
I be goin' through it on the low (Yeah)
I be tryna hide it (Hide it)
I be doin' dirt on the hush
I be keepin' quiet (Quiet)
I don't wanna lose this shit (No way)
Mama can't afford that life (That life)
Pull out the McLaren for the day (Then what?)
Pull up in the Porsche at night, tryna run away from
All these demons after me
They just keep harassin' me
They ain't gonna stop until I fall

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Starin' in the mirror like, "What happened to me?"
You been starvin', ain't had nothin' to eat
And lately you been scared to fall asleep
'Cause you been havin' bad dreams of me fallin' (Fallin', fallin')
Starin' in the mirror like, "What happened to me?" (What happened to me?)
You been starvin', ain't had nothin' to eat (Yeah, yeah)
And lately you been scared to fall asleep (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause you been havin' bad dreams of me fallin' (Fallin', fallin')

[Outro: Derez De'Shon]
Too young (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
To young (Fallin', fallin')
