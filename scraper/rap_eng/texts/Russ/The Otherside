[Hook: Russ]
You know what it is when I slide through
I could lift you up you only 5'2
Maybe get you drunk, maybe high too
Maybe fall in love, maybe fall in love
I could take you to the otherside, yeah
Show you that there's more than meets the eye, yeah
Maybe get you drunk, maybe high too
Maybe fall in love, maybe fall in love

[Verse 1: Russ]
Listen up girl
You could push a button and something pops out on
The otherside but they don't teach that
They just want you trapped in your mind

[Bridge: Russ]
I should let you know that there's a chance you get addicted
Cause the shit I put you on, ain't really no one out here fucking with me
But if you're okay with that then lets proceed just grab my hand
Imma' take you to the otherside, into the promise land

[Interlude: Russ]
Tell me that I'm getting through to you
Tell me that I'm getting through, through
Tell me that I'm getting through to you
Tell me that I'm getting through, through
