[Hook x2: Russ + Squire]
Bang, bang she shot me up
Straight into my veins
Now she got me up
I'm so high
And I don't wanna' be that
Girl you know I need that
I fuck around and relapse

[Verse 1: Russ]
Couple bottles to the face
I'm about to go way up
Couple hoes on my phone
Shows on my play
Money way up

[Bridge: Squire]
I can not sleep
So I got me a freak
Just to stay up
I can not sleep
So I got me some weed
Roll a J up

[Hook x2: Russ + Squire]
Bang, bang she shot me up
Straight into my veins
Now she got me up
I'm so high
And I don't wanna' be that
Girl you know I need that
I fuck around and relapse

[Verse 2: Russ]
Bullet proof vest on my chest
Since my ex used to guide me
If you give your body to somebody
I might catch a body

[Bridge: Squire]
I can not sleep
So I got me a freak
Just to stay up
I can not sleep
So I got me some weed
Roll a J up

[Hook x2: Russ + Squire]
Bang, bang she shot me up
Straight into my veins
Now she got me up
I'm so high
And I don't wanna' be that
Girl you know I need that
I fuck around and relapse

[Verse 3: Russ]
Lotta' fucked up shit
Lotta' good shit too
Lotta' liquor in my liver
Lotta' kush lit too
Lotta' run-ins with God
Lotta' time to self reflect
Lotta' people who depend on me
Lotta' pressure on my neck
All my exes ran the same, X and Os
Now I pack the studio
Out with freaks
On the daily
Just to numb these hoes
Who did me cold
Fuck the bullshit
Yo' temperatures droppin'
My buzz is risin'
Woah, what's up world
I'm 'bout to be poppin'
While you floppin'
Livin' life behind the window
Bitches on the outside shoppin'
I'm that new new shit that their into
But baby, ain't no price tag
I'll choose you if you're worthy
My middle name is James
I'm ballin' like a Laker
Hang my mutha' fuckin' jersey
Climb the list
Of the bodies that I've built
While on my way to will
Nothing to be proud of
Ex calls my phone, damn, I know
Talkin' ain't the only good
That mutha' fuckin' mouth does

[Hook x2: Russ + Squire]
Bang, bang she shot me up
Straight into my veins
Now she got me up
I'm so high
And I don't wanna' be that
Girl you know I need that
I fuck around and relapse
