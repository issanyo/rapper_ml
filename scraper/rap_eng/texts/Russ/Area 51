[Intro]
Yeah, hello hello
Welcome to my lifestyle
Days in the A may be tame but the night's wild
So I'm gon' stay loose
Sippin' on some greygoose
Trynna run the game without the chains or the vape juice

[Verse 1]
Marry it, carry it, ride on the chariot
Grow old, blow smoke, die when I bury it
But I just hope that I can handle all the lime light
I can set my clock but, God's got the time right
Nothing else left but I'm blessed 'cuz my mind's right
One man's test is the same man's hindsight
One damn check makes a motherfucker shine twice
One plan left 'till I'm next so I grind like;
3 blind mice trynna find  a piece of cheese
3 white knights trynna find the key to dreams
Speak my mind cuz I'm keepin' alive
'Cuz I read fine lines just to breathe, breathe

[Hook]
Sometimes I find myself
Ridin' 'round Atlanta with my windows down
Trynna keep it simple now, yeah
'Cuz it don't matter where you've been just what you're after
So I'm ridin' slow, 'cuz my dreams are coming faster
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I wasn't born in the A but I'm scorched in the aye
Got scotch so Iâ€™m hot like scorch in the day
When he was making bangers, I was making plans
Trynna use my fingers make the world in my hands
I was young and I'm still am, but I'm getting older
Money on my mind and my music's on my shoulder
Pain on my heart and it's only getting colder
Play the game, do my part, then I end up with the floater
Would've told you if I knew you Atlanta Brave girl
...[?]...
Singing "Shoutout to my ex's, hello to the future"
Bring around some blessings that my past is not used to
Imma be the one, never 2, never 3
Trynna better what I've done and improve what I see
Imma measure what I've won by the roofs that I breach
Imma tread you with some drums and the proofs of my beats

[Hook]
Sometimes I find myself
Ridin' 'round Atlanta with my windows down
Trynna keep it simple now, yeah
'Cuz it don't matter where we've been just what you have to
So I'm ridin' slow, 'cuz my dreams are coming faster
Yeah

You keep on hating
I just keep chasing
What I want, doing what I want
I'm what you need, who cares what you want so
Just keep on hating
I'll just keep chasing
What I want, doing what I want
I'm what you need, fuck what you want so
[x2]

Sometimes I find myself
Ridin' 'round Atlanta with my windows down
Trynna keep it simple now, yeah
'Cuz it don't matter where we've been just what you have to
So I'm ridin' slow, 'cuz my dreams are coming faster
Yeah
