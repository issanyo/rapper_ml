[Intro: Shiloh Dynasty & Russ]
Tell, tell, tell, yuh (yuh)

[Chorus: Russ & Shiloh Dynasty]
Tell me why you're waiting
I don’t give a fuck 'bout
Tell me why you're waiting
I don’t give a fuck 'bout
Tell my why you're waiting for so long
Tell me why you're waiting, waiting

[Verse 1]
Watch you back up
Know you’re scared to love again
Every time you try, part of you just dies, you lookin dumb again
It’s so hard to trust again
So just like that you don’t (uh)
You 'gon just get drunk again roll up and fuckin' smoke (uh)
That one used to beat on you
That one used to cheat on you
The only one that cared, you ain’t believe him so he’s leavin you
Ain’t no family round you
Ain’t no friends that you can trust
Ain’t no love within yourself
But ain’t no way I’m giving up (come on)

[Chorus: Russ & Shiloh Dynasty]
Tell me why you're waiting
I don’t give a fuck 'bout
Tell me why you're waiting
I don’t give a fuck 'bout
Tell my why you're waiting for so long
Tell me why you're waiting, waiting

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I swoop in and do my thing against my better judgment
I could tell you been through hell you need some better loving
I see movin on is hard
I see nooses round your heart
I see bruises, I see scars
I see proof to wanna start over
But you can’t see past the pain
I swear your past got you enslaved girl, you can’t see past the chains
I try showin you and tellin you the love you deserve
But me lovin you won’t work until you lovin you first (damn)

[Chorus: Russ & Shiloh Dynasty]
Tell me why you're waiting
I don’t give a fuck 'bout
Tell me why you're waiting
I don’t give a fuck 'bout
Tell my why you’re waiting for so long
Tell me why you're waiting
I don’t give a fuck 'bout
Tell my why you're waiting for someone
Tell me why you're waiting, waiting
