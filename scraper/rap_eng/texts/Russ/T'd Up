[Hook: Russ]
Bitch I'm T'd up
I think I drank three much
I been mixin' wit' it too
Couple women comin' through
They gon' wanna' T up wit' me too
Bitch I'm T'd up
I think I drank three much
I been mixin' wit' it too
Couple women comin' through
They gon' wanna' T up wit' me too

[Verse 1: Russ]
Tanqueray got me started
I think I need a girl from Harlem
Don't act like you
Don't wanna' get involved with me
TLC got girls tryna' creep
Don't catch feelings it ain't that deep
Thrown in the studio, gone fishin'
Tryna' catch me a freak, damn
Need two rooms every time I land
One for hoes, one room for the bands
She fell in love cause of who I am
I don't give a fuck, gotta' stick to the plan
No strings girl, gotta' cut those loose
You and your friend, that's one plus two
You'll be waitin' here all night
Waitin' for me to love you

[Hook: Russ]
Bitch I'm T'd up
I think I drank three much
I been mixin' wit' it too
Couple women comin' through
They gon' wanna' T up wit' me too
Bitch I'm T'd up
I think I drank three much
I been mixin' wit' it too
Couple women comin' through
They gon' wanna' T up wit' me too

[Refrain: Russ]
I been T'd up that's a routine
Never switched up wit' a new team
I been spendin'
I been stackin'
I still got the same old hoopty
I been helpin' out the fam
I'm just tryna' do my best
Feel the pressure everyday
Gotta' get this off my chest

[Verse 2: Russ]
Always had faith it would go my way
I been T'd up for like six years straight
I know what's like to do a show with less people in the crowd than the ones on stage
Bugus and me never switched up
Always got weed we can twist up
Never let an outsider in too quick
Got the whole game zip, zipped up

[Hook: Russ]
Bitch I'm T'd up
I think I drank three much
I been mixin' wit' it too
Couple women comin' through
They gon' wanna' T up wit' me too
Bitch I'm T'd up
I think I drank three much
I been mixin' wit' it too
Couple women comin' through
They gon' wanna' T up wit' me too
Bitch I'm T'd up
I think I drank three much
I been mixin' wit' it too
Couple women comin' through
They gon' wanna' T up wit' me too
Bitch I'm T'd up
I think I drank three much
I been mixin' wit' it too
Couple women comin' through
They gon' wanna' T up wit' me too
