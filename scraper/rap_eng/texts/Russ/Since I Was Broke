[Chorus]
I been sayin' I was rich since I was broke (yeah, yeah)
It's a state of mind, you gotta know (yeah, yeah)
That it's gonna happen fo' sho (mmm)
Had to take my time, take it slow (yeah)
I been sayin' I was rich since I was broke (yeah yeah)
It's a state of mind, you gotta know (yeah yeah)
That it's gonna happen fo' sho (mmm)
Had to take my time, take it slow (yeah)

[Verse 1]
Always felt myself, this isn't new (new new new)
Always felt I had some shit to prove (prove prove prove)
Not to you though, to me
Vin Diesel voice, I roll deep
When local girls were the dream girls, this is ten years with no sleep
Yeah, that ain't a Nissan, that's a McLaren
That what I told myself, that's how I got it
I recognized the thoughts in my mind were directly connected to what's in my pocket
It's in your head, money will come, as soon as you feel like you already have it
Napoleon Hill, Deepak, and Paulo
That's what I read and I made this shit happen, yeah

[Chorus]
I been sayin' I was rich since I was broke (yeah, yeah)
It's a state of mind, you gotta know (yeah, yeah)
That it's gonna happen fo' sho (mmm)
Had to take my time, take it slow (yeah)
I been sayin' I was rich since I was broke (yeah yeah)
It's a state of mind, you gotta know (yeah yeah)
That it's gonna happen fo' sho (mmm)
Had to take my time, take it slow (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Get lost in yourself, that's how you find you
Focus on what fuels you and drives you
Recognize the power inside you
Chase your passion, not just the money (yeah)
I knew it was all on me, all my bets were all on me
I knew if I called the universe enough, it'd call on me
I believed in non-existent, all my thoughts into fruition
Poke the universe enough, it turns around and grants your wishes

[Chorus]
I been sayin' I was rich since I was broke (yeah, yeah)
It's a state of mind, you gotta know (yeah, yeah)
That it's gonna happen fo' sho (mmm)
Had to take my time, take it slow (yeah)
I been sayin' I was rich since I was broke (yeah yeah)
It's a state of mind, you gotta know (yeah yeah)
That it's gonna happen fo' sho (mmm)
Had to take my time, take it slow (yeah)

[Outro]
Yeah
It's all in yo' head
It's all in yo' head
It's all in yo' head
