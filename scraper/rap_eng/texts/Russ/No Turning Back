[Intro]
Guess I'm finally right here
Guess there's no turning back
Pop star of the year, still a god with the raps
Whole family know I got it, guess I'm too rich to hide it
There's no turning back, back, back

[Verse 1]
Couple million tucked away, 25 to touch the stage
When I'm in L.A I'm probably in a Bentley or a Wraith
People tryin to bring me down cause they see me goin' up
If you try and play my life I'm sending people with some guns
I don't fuck around with that, anybody can get touched
Got the family on my back, you fuckin 'round with the wrong one

[Hook]
Hope the people still relate but my music is my life and my life just changed but
There's no turnin back, no
Guess I'm finally right here
Guess there's no turning back
Pop star of the year, still a god with the raps
Whole family know I got it, guess I'm too rich to hide it
There's no turning back, back, back

[Verse 2]
Wonder where I'm flyin next
Got my dad on private jets
Everybody's got a number I might go and buy my ex
Sellin out across the globe, if you really want to know
I just made 8 figures and I'm talkin net not talkin gross
Not bad for a dropout, see me rollin in a droptop
I can't stop no not now, 10 years I finally got hot

[Hook]
Hope the people still relate but my music is my life and my life just changed but
There's no turnin back, no
Guess I'm finally right here
Guess there's no turning back
Pop star of the year, still a god with the raps
Whole family know I got it, guess I'm too rich to hide it
There's no turning back, back, back
