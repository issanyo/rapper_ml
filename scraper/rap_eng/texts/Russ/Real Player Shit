[Verse 1: Bugus]
Deception is the shepered and we all sheep
But I'm that big bad wolf that's on Wall Street
I'm coming through, Imma' scoop you
Come and see the crib, I got views like YouTube
Someone tell everything in sight I might wreck 'em
When I'm on that ass, women bend it like Beckham
Travel the globe everywhere, I light reefer
Man I kick it all around the world like FIFA
Block from Alonso, coming in like ya' rent late
Knock from the Congo, coming in like dikembe
Want my autograph? Imma' sign it by ya' bosom
Grams likes eggs, bitch we buy them by the dozen
Cousins know Imma' get dough
Imma' jack ass
Im an asshole
I been a fat ass
I been overweight
Now I'm over priced
Shows been over payed
Flights been overnight
I'm overseas, blowing trees

[Verse 2: Russ]
Lately my next calls been better than my last ones
Wondering what it's like when the cash comes
Like what will I be driving when I pass them
And what are their excuses when I ask them
But fuck that, shots up, me and Boog
When were on, bulletproof all the vehicles
Strapped up and paranoid, that's how the bus looks
Self belief and passion, that's how Russ looks
I tried to expose all my ex hoes, to the other side
But they ain't got shit on my mother, I'm
A real one, you can't fool me
Groupies are bloopers, I'm tryna' wife a movie
Building up my team, I gotta' lawyer if you sue me
Connects in the hood, on call if you shoot me
I'm living through my truth
You just out here living through me
If I fly your girl coach and she giving up the Coochie
Real player shit, come on

[Hook x2: Russ]
All I really know I was stoned like medusa
Next thing I know I was blown like a tuba
Gotta' let her know that it's time to catch an uber
Girl you gotta' go hit the road, real player shit
