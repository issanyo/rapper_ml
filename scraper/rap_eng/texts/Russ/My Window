[Chorus]
Come to my window
I can't close my blinds it's real (oh, oh, oh)
Come to my window
I can't wipe you off it's real (oh, oh, oh)

[Verse]
I been sensin' things about to change now
In and outta countries and states now
'Bout to fly my fam out to LA now
Gettin' booked for shows, I'm gettin' paid now
Fell in love with swervin', fuck a lane now
Fuck a mask and cape just use my name
Swear to god I'm poppin' any day now
Recognize tomorrow, knew myself and hit the lotto

[Chorus]
Come to my window
I can't close my blinds it's real (oh, oh, oh)
Come to my window
I can't wipe you off it's real (oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
I been mixin' things I probably shouldn't
I been coachin' myself, I'm John Wooden
I been flippin' chairs over like Bob Knight
I been puttin' pressure on like prom night

[Verse]
I can't see shit but I believe in my vision
Women, dollars, and travelin' lately that's how I'm livin'
CEO of myself, lately that's how I'm winnin'
I'm from the cloth of a boss
I gotta hustler's ambition damn
Expanding my network
From the internet I call that making the net work
Real people fuckin' with you is real wealth
That's human capital
That's how you grow your networth
Imma make your neck hurt
Come on

[Chorus]
Come to my window
I can't close my blinds it's real (oh, oh, oh)
Come to my window
I can't wipe you off it's real (oh, oh, oh)
