[Verse 1: Russ]
We were crazy in love
The kind of love you make a song bout
You loved me way before I ever put a song out
It was real, organic like its spose to be
First day I saw you, I was hoping that you noticed me
You the reason why I love latinas
Only girl I ever smoked with, without Tequila
Back when I use to cop a couple quarters a week
And smoke the whole thing with you, round them hood ass streets
That was good ass weed
It's crazy though yo, that plugs dead
And I ain't talkin dead to me
I'm talkin real blood shed
I'll admit a lots changed since then, yeah
I've been getting hot, makin waves since then, yeah
I've been outta state getting paid since then
Fucking girls off my name and the fame since then
But still, I almost wanna' call and ask truthfully
Am I the same or did I change from what I use to be, yeah

[Hook: Russ]
I've been thinking 'bout this girl I had a good thing
With, until I fucked it up, yuh
I've been looking for this girl in all these other girls
But they just fuck it up
Oooo-oo-oo, nothing like the first love, first love
Oooo-oo-oo, they're the best one and the worst one, worst one

[Verse 2: Russ]
Yuh, cause you were with me from the jump, even before day one
Now the girls, the more songs I drop the more they come
But none of my next girls were a keeper like you
I should call this, late night thoughts featuring you
Cause when I wake up
I probably won't feel the same but
That ain't gonna change the
Way the moon got me here tryna' make up
I fucked up a couple times, we never moved passed that
I'm sorry 'bout that Colombian girl, with the fat ass
And the other two I didn't mention, 'till we split
I gambled with your trust, I shoulda' never took that risk
I shoulda' realized what I had, a down ass latin chick
The type of girl that you makes you see, there's no such thing as accidents
Wasn't on no hoe shit
She was on her own shit
I know I'm the reason why that winter was the coldest
But it happened how it's spose to
At least that's what I tell myself
Drinking, thinking I should try and call you
I can't help myself
