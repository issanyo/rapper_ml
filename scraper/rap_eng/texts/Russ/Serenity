I used to be sober every second of my day
Now I can't sleep without a bottle of champagne
What the fuck is going on?
My mom is saying rehab, dad is saying Russ what the fuck?
Well oh gee dad what did you expect?

Dropped out of school to make beats
Gionna needs this, Frank needs that, mom needs a
House on the beach
My best friend Nate got caught by police
They got him down town, locked up right street

(What the fuck we gonna do now, do now?
We need an angel from above, above
To come down and show us love)

I used to be sober every second of my day
Now I can't sleep without a bottle of champagne
What the fuck is going on?
My mom is saying rehab, dad is saying Russ what the fuck?
Well oh gee dad what did you expect?

It was me , one nice girl in the picture
Half brother and a half sister
It never hit me, wonder if they miss me
Tears fallin' down on the face of Jimmy
That's my dad, and his first son
Wonder bout my mom, was she gone?
Was she numb?
I can't wrap my head around it, around it
And for the longest time I was in the great area
No shine, but the light shine bright on the truth
Now I'm drinkin' gin all night in the booth

I used to be sober every second of my day
Now I can't sleep without a bottle of champagne
What the fuck is going on?
My mom is saying rehab, dad is saying Russ what the fuck?
Well oh gee dad what did you expect?

God, grant me the serenity to accept things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can and wisdom to know the difference
Yeah

I used to be sober every second of my day
Now I can't sleep without a bottle of champagne
What the fuck is going on?
My mom is saying rehab, dad is saying Russ what the fuck?
Well oh gee dad what did you expect?
