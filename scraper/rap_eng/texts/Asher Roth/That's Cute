[Intro]
Mhmm, yeah, at least it's just bass

[Verse 1]
Fuck everything you heard about
Your word of mouth ain’t worth a dollar
Verses vicious versatile, don’t you take it personal
Turn around, tell another person how I birthed your style
Now  I make you nervous, I’m superfluous, is this allowed?
This is child abuse, I’d beat my kid if he was you
Use the same switch that AP did
These nincompoops, no more cute
Fuck the rules, draft him next year too
This ain't fantasy, you pansy, get your Netflix queue
We on that next shit
Your best bet is to get 2 bedrooms with a pool
A nice view on lake and just move
Take the next few, digest, pack a couple bathing suits
Take your lady on vacation get away, just you two
Get a clue on what to do when in the presence of a fool
Never hesitate to set them straight, don’t get it misconstrued
It's a lesson how to dress when you don’t have a thing to prove
Ayahuasca and a headdress, resting in Peru

[Chorus]
That's cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you, but that's cute
That's cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you, but that's cute
That's cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you, but that's cute
That's cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you, but that's cute

[Verse 2]
Slip and slide, sit inside
Had Xzibit pimp my ride
Pick her up at 8, but show up later, maybe close to 9
Won’t apologize, other things up on my mind
Like time is money, honey, hope you hungry even though you side piece
Chi tea, ladiha, looking like Ashanti
High for the first time, tell her that I mind read
Nah mean? Sitting shotgun, blowing shotties
Avi top 3, so work that body, body
Don’t hurt nobody, my bonds diversified as my rhymes
Verses as hot as the mom of Steph Curry, c'mon
The broad side of a barn goes unharmed when you're on
Your arms as strong as I’m hurried
Like when Curtis through the first pitch
Worse then a nerve twitch
Controlling the motherboard, captain of the Mothership
The whirling dervish of this word shit
At my worst I’m perfect, at your girl’s nursing

[Chorus]
That's cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you, but that's cute
That's cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you, but that's cute
That's cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you, but that's cute
That's cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you, but that's cute
