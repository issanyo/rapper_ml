She don't want a man man man man, she just wants to dance, just dance
Quiet and confident, not a bit, I'm the shit
Screaming out, out loud, right now, I'm the shit
Let 'em know, let it go, feelin' sexy, feelin' grown
I be sippin' on patron mixed with pineapple
Then she looks up, spots me only for a sec
But in that moment, our eyes locked, I swear that we had sex
Yeah, In that tank top, tight jeans, high heels, nice teeth
Ooh, I think she likes me but, but it be unlikely
Ain't looking for no man man, really just came here to dance dance
On the dance floor

(I know you want my body, I just came to party)
Ain't looking for romance mance, really just came to dance dance
On the dance floor

(I know you want my body, I just came to party)
She don't want a man, she just wants to dance
She don't want a man, she just wants to dance on the dance floor
I see Boyder and ask him, "Yo can you take her fat friend?"
He laughs and then digs it "Hell yeah, I'll be your wingman"
We two-step, we grooving', we dancing', we movin'
The crowd be through it, people getting real stupid
Check my breath then my sweat on my chest and my pits
Yeah I'm fresh, super fresh, I would do me in a sec
Bout to get my dance on so I put my hands on her
Then she frowns, turns around with a look like
Ain't looking for no man man, really just came here to dance dance
On the dance floor

(I know you want my body, I just came to party)
Ain't looking for romance mance, really just came to dance dance
On the dance floor

(I know you want my body, I just came to party)
She don't want a man, she just wants to dance
She don't want a man, she just wants to dance on the dance floor
Boy, you need to cool down cause I'm way too hot
(Girl, you need to cool out cause you not that hot)
See, I'm just tryna cool down cause I'm way too hot
(Girl, you need to cool out cause you not that hot
I'm just playing, I'm just hating, no, you way too hot)
Ain't looking for no man man, really just came here to dance dance
On the dance floor

(I know you want my body, I just came to party)
Ain't looking for romance mance, really just came to dance dance
On the dance floor

(I know you want my body, I just came to party)
She don't want a man, she just wants to dance
She don't want a man, she just wants to dance on the dance floor
