[Intro]
Wrestling is fake y'all
Wrestling is fake

[Verse 1]
Hey how you? Name Ash Roth did a  deja-vu
Ya I spit raw so the kind of taboo
So tune to talk talk with a bit of panzu
True, what you’re gonna do
If you don’t know I’m the illest in the room
And a cut dome maybe trippin' on shrooms
With the tippy toe flow call it killer tofu
Beats old with the heat
And this ski slope like I'm [???]
Please Eric B, don't sweat the technique
Peeing like I’m R Kelly on the belly of the beast
Freak can’t scare me
But you gotta stare like a weird head piece
Tortoise and the hare it ain't all about speed
I’ma give a fair share while I take it easy
Police, Sting was my dad
I’ll be sleep with the need no rap
I can chief keef bro we smoke hash
You be all about [???] with the neat mustache
Cash, that’s what I need other than that all set low key
Go ahead laugh, it's in the bag, other rappers be [???] when it last in the week
Ash a disease to be passed when you breathe
If you ask in the past to be pass in the sleep
Ask me cheat, Ray Allen to the heat
You can’t blame me my talent to South Beach
Fate, piece of cake
Excuse me while I clean my plate
Let me do me I don’t need no hate
I just wanna go down uptown on [???]
Bake I’ma day straight love my city PA my state
Hang out in Philly when I wanna get away
I’ll be on the first plane I’ll be headed to the bay
Wait rock their shoe
The Angelo knows voodoo so move
Left mojo in my favourite suit
Get boose when I’m dump when I listen in the..
Proof rhythm of the states
Wish I had a sponsor ship from Hanes
Hit up MJ, tell him yo dawg thanks
This no tag biz is the shit don’t change
Fame is the hell of the drug
In a hotel in a bed with a bug
Couldn’t tell french bulldog or pug
But I'd rather go to the bar instead of the club
Nope I’ma stay home
Watch Game of Thrones on the HBO
It’s a dope show, for those who don’t know
With swords and Drogos and girls with no clothes
Whoa, sounds like a hit
I been loving tits since I was little kid
Sega Genesis and a Snuffleupagus I will never love another better pucker up them lips
Chips, Dunkaroos, and I love to play Crash Bandicoot
Tryin fake sick stay home for school
But the only thing on was soaps and news
Screw it hang with the babes
First french kiss it came in sixth grade
First girlfriend her name was Paige
It's same time when I found out wrestling it was fake
Hey, hey
