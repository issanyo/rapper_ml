There's a long road ahead of me, You'll never get a better seat
Than right there on your sofa listening to my second CD
Since Asleep I've been constantly wrestling me
I had to face reality and actually question defeat
See, I think it's all because I'm light-skinned
But the ones hating on me is these mother-fucking white kids
I mean jeez, you should see all of the disses
All the "suck a dick I'll kill you fucking bitch"
I'm like what the hell is this shit?
I thought it was rappin' for the kids
Not rappin' for you bitch, you simply don't exist
Won't pay attention to the henchman who was sent in to prevent me from
Possessing everything I ever wanted
No, I am not a product knock off, back stock last option
I'm a full thought process, defined hypothesis
A why not, who, how, what if
I'm always thinking how it's all about confidence
Cause if you're thinking negative then by god it is
What you thinking 'bout it turns it in to how you live
But I wanna be rich, six kids in a sick crib
Pushing a whip, that Waltrip, would give a sixth rib for
And no shit this is what these bitches strip for
With real tits, this is what they suck dick for
And no lie, it costs to be alive
And I'm lucky cause I feel I got an extra set of eyes on me
Watching, making sure it's done properly
And making sure I earn that waterfront property
Cause nothing's handed to you, you've gotta demand it, dude
Not only must you know it, but you've gotta understand it too
A Young man, just started standing on my two
Started planting a garden, planning for the fu-
-ture, with that, who needs a feature?
I got sixteens that will leave them in a wheelchair
I've been real way before my first pube hair
Or way before I first played truth-or-dare
And I chose truth, those who hoax I will expose you
There's no room for ballooned ego's and vocals
Pro tools doesn't really mean you flow, fool
And I'm a pro, this is flowing through my nostrils
