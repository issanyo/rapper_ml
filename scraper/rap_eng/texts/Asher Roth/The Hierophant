Yo, I'm done fantasizing on what the hell the 8 of wands means
The Hierophant, pulling from the sky, my guide's a higher one
Tiresome, operating in the land of Viacom
Diabolical creatures fucking up my [?]
Buy a gun, take it to the range and make it fire son
Would you buy a tire if you haven't even tried it on
So many fish are in the sea but I'm a giant prawn
So what I need isn't easy, I could die alone
And broke is easy, tanning naked in the quiet sauna
Thinking that everything's all right because of marijuana
Ayo where's Sarah Connor? If she's gone then I'm a goner
And defense of our dishonor, I'm an honest kid your honor
By the time this verse is over, I will self destruct
Fuck it up like I tripped and kicked the bucket
Right before the party jumps, yell "surprise, good retirement"
You're fired old timer, 65 year old fireman
Playing the theremin for [?] of heroin
To take care of my parents cause the damage is from Merrill Lynch
Careless errors be embarrassed you embarrassment
This is [?] like counting sticks for nourishment
Terrance didn't get a scholarship for this
This is bullshit, you're being tricked, don't let them pull the hood kids
Over your eyes, disguised as the wolf sheep
The hood speaks, sleeps, and bounds with gold teeth
Beware of hypebeasts, Carebears with nice [?]
And nice hairs and nice features
Say things like "Nice to meet you"
I bite the peach with teachers from [?]
You gotta say capisce, I think that would make it easier
