We blowing wet weed
Your baby moma got an x3
Wanna shoot a movie and shit, I’m the directing
Spend a lot of money on gold, I’m investing
Talking to the president, from the west wing
Watching the jet’s game while I’m jet skiing
Yeah, I got diamonds on my neck, damnnn
You know I got come correct
We getting more money than a lot of them expect
I’m the type of rapper that a lot of them respect
We selling more records than a lot of them forget
Yeah, I’m in the hills, counting bills
You still in the projects, I am progress
I am pop fresh, my Rolex on, ain't them rob that
I’m in my sweats trying spin my lex (Lexus)
You in my way, all in my steps
Yea, I said it’s fin to be a crash
When I hear shots from the enemies I laugh
I’m styling on every single enemy I have
Them cheap ass clothes should be giving you a rash
I bring grace to this, put my name on your list
Before I erase the shit
You know we fin to get a little cake with this
If the money looking good come taste it bitch
I get cake for this, I wanna see some pretty girls shake to this
All the bad hoes can’t wait for this
2 girls try to have me raped to this, ah
I got mix to get, big money shit I got banks to hit
Nigga, you got drinks to get
And roll that motherfucking stanky shit

[Hook]
I got bank, new jeeps, no doors, no top
I got bank, new jeeps, no doors, no top
I got bank, new jeeps, no doors, no top
I got bank, new jeeps, no doors, no top
I got bank

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
Flea flicking and fly girls at freak nick
Picky particularly when on weed shit
Niche is, neatly at ease
I don’t need shit
Beefing, keeping the pieces in then the trees lit
Prefix mixing with chicks I tell them read lips
D tits gets you cc'd on my me list
She said it’s Gemini crickets, give me 3 wishes
Take sit right on the beach, fresh off the G6
Far east moving out, few things I do without
Smoother than a hooper through the legs and hit the turn around
Murder in the urban town, swear that they can burn it down
Heard that I was working be sure that I deserve the crown
It’s what’s the world’s about, get your money get on out
Sneak around the house if you mama said you ain’t allowed
Ain’t nobody perfect child, we just make it worth a while
Urbs getting nervous since I started wearing turbans out

I got bank, new jeeps, no doors, no top
I got bank, new jeeps, no doors, no top
I got bank, new jeeps, no doors, no top
I got bank, new jeeps, no doors, no top
I got bank

[Verse 3: Sir Michael Rocks]
One time for bitches with their hands up
You know, the ones who quick to switch their plans up
As Shawty sending me, you a winner, I seen ya
The queen, them other bitches is going to the ringer
You used to date tatyana ali
Was kinda freak
The crib on the side of the beach
Now I’ma tell you, but I gotta be brief
The hole of the economy is deep
Deeper than the bottom of creeks
Well fuck you, call me anything but broke and stupid
We getting paper and you ain’t gonna do shit
As I a introduce it, 2 girls on the camera guess who coproduce it nigga
I got a dice game to get to, in the range new issue
The champagne toast to sip to
Some bad hoes chilling in swim suits
And they probably down for anything that we in to
The gold chain old range mustangs jeeps and drops
Rolex watch and all the essentials
Got the phil gamble right on the gym suit
Man, and the condo that I just moved in to

I got bank, new jeeps, no doors, no top
I got bank, new jeeps, no doors, no top
I got bank, new jeeps, no doors, no top
I got bank, new jeeps, no doors, no top
I got bank
