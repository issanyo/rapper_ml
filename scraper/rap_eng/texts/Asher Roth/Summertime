[Hook (Quan)]
Summertime, blue skies
Feel the breeze, blowing trees
And it feels good, so good
Like it should, can you feel it too?

[Verse 1 - Asher Roth]
Summer sand, sun and tanned
Feeling like a 100 grand
Underpants up in France
Like I'm from another land
I'm a man, I got needs
Like I need you on your knees
Hummer me underneath
Don't forget the N-U-T's
Where the weed, where the weed begin
What you see me in starting with
B and M. Tell me what's the BPM?
89, yeah that's fine, feeling like
It's Summertime. Sipping something
Potent, hope it's love potion number 9
Damn you fine, from behind, what's your sign?
What's your size? Up your bra, oh my God
Knock it off, knockers all natural
Actual, but he won't, Asher will
I'm down for anything but only if the
Ass is still..water in my ?
Using it as mouthwash - woosh, woosh
Kush, kush - don't you wish
This was your life? This is your night
When it comes to Summertime
Don't you know the world is mine?

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Asher Roth]
Rolling down the street, need to
Celebrate the weekend
Picking up my best friends
Tell em bring the weed and
90 degrees, even got a slight breeze
And, I don't need to tell you that
This be my favorite season
Hanging on the beach, but I'm sitting
Under trees, and got a little vodka
Mixed in my iced tea, and don't you know
I'm light-skinned? Gotta use the right shit
SPF 45th, chilling in my whiteness
Rolling up sticky buds, sticking all
To my thumbs, only smoking on a joint
No, I can't be smoking blunts
Time for fun, just invite the hot ones
Bring em to the hot tub, suddenly
Their tops gone, now I'm rock hard
Living like a rock star, push it
To the limit but stay out the back
Of cop cars. Can't be locked up
By law enfocement. All I do is lean back
Breathe, and enjoy this..

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Catch me in that '83 heavy Chevy
Deuce for the piping
Candy with a clear coat, girls to my liking
36-24-36 sizes, Coke bottle models
Filled with surprises, eyes is
Wide and girlfriends giggling
Eenie-meenie-minie, trying to find out
What I'm swimming in
In the sundress, that'll undress
Who got a body and brains, game's
The dumbest. Trees be the bombest
Loving the calmness
Living life too right to get the wrong shit
And I'm on this, get to my money
Blow dro, spit flows, lay low
Where it's sunny, can't complain about
A thang mane, when chilling with
Some of the finest thangs on the continent
So I'm content with having a good time
In my zone, on Patron with a splash of lime
