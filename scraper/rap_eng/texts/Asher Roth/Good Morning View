[Verse 1]
There’s nothing like waking up to the sun in you face, like
"hey kid, let’s play, today is the day", I feel great after a full night sleep
And really cool dream bout this bakery, eggs and bacon please
And a warm cup o' tea with some honey, yeah honey
Milk and honey, my buddies love it, I run a'muck, my lungies up
I never need a tummy tuck, a dummy luck
Got a chuckle like something is funny ’cause, life is wonderful
Never let it trouble you, but when it do
Remember the number one rule, that this too shall pass
So throw on that new Ash, take the shoes off
Put them bare feet in the grass, like

(Hey you know what I’m saying
Just like, it's a nice ass day outside
Blue sky, not a cloud in it
Sing along)

[Chorus]
I got a real good feeling everything is gonna be alright y'all, alright y'all
I got a real good feeling everything is gonna be alright y'all, alright y'all

[Verse 2]
Yeah barbecue and maybe hop in the pool
The truth is we got nothing to lose
'cept listen to tunes, stay cool ,and just take in the view
Horseshoes, maybe open a brew
Hope you know that you'll lose, that’s the move
Yeah let’s go to the roof
Roll a doob, take a moment or two
Soak it in from the wind to the summit
Sing from the stomach, sonny, keep your tongue in
Don't let it run from you, say something you know nothing about
Right out loud all in front of the crowd
Settle down and enjoy what is coming
World is our onion, pearl keep it for a hundred, no fronting, I

I'm saying though, just like
Be honest and chill, hang with your friends
It's a good time to be alive y'all

[Chorus]
I got a real good feeling everything is gonna be alright y'all, alright y'all
I got a real good feeling everything is gonna be alright y'all, alright y'all

[Bridge]
This my favorite song, you gotta put it on
This my favorite song, yeah you gotta put it on
This my favorite song, you gotta put it on
This my favorite song, yeah you gotta put it on
This my favorite song, you gotta put it on
This my favorite song, yeah you gotta put it on
This my favorite song, you gotta put it on
This my favorite song, yeah you gotta put it on

[Chorus]
I got a real good feeling everything is gonna be alright y'all, alright y'all
I got a real good feeling everything is gonna be alright y'all, alright y'all
