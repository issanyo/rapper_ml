[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Don't it feel so good
Say it out loud, lemme hear y'all
It's the weekend, you can fill my cup
Put it in the air, don't care, so what
Day's been long but the night's still young
And the prettiest of women wanna have some fun
Place be jumpin', Nate Dogg pumpin
Put your bag down, take a break for once
Dance on the floor if you want to
Make plans, bring friends, yeah come through
Do a little 2-step, yeah 1 2
Getting drunk til I start doing kung fu
Rum's cool, with a little Red Bull
And a tiny bit of lemon: goes down so smooth
I'm grown up now so there's really no rules
I'm happy that I made it through the day
Let it go, like:

[Chorus]
Hey, it's another one down
Another one down

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
There's a lot going on in the world, man
I just wanna kick back with my girlfriend
Get an ice cream cone, put a swirl in
And not worry about when the work ends
Self-serve, man we going way too fast
Need to slow down, lean back, relax
Turn the tunes up, throw down them bags
Pick yourself up, man don't be sad
It ain't that bad, don't freak son
Some things can't take Liam Neeson
Got fam, got friends, got freedom
Good to have an iPhone, don't need one
Let me see some, screaming out "ole"
Time to celebrate, hip-hop hooray
This ones on me; no work, all play
I'm happy that I made it through the day
Let it go like:

[Chorus]
Hey, it's another one down
Another one down

[Bridge]
Baby, life is more than
Making copies and drinking coffee
It's time for me to make time for me (Right?)
Baby, we should celebrate
And go crazy, just you and me

[Chorus]
Hey, it's another one down
Another one down
