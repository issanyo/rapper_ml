[Verse 1]
Look baby, I'm feeling you so I feel it too
I'm not offended cause I know just how the realest do
Don't take a genie to know you got a rep to uphold
It takes a lifetim to build, a couple men to unfold
Don't ruin that from a boy, [?] rose
Gotta be in control, how unprofessional
A centerfold, not a not a slut or a hoe
So of course she don't want you to know
She only wanna get

[Hook]
She only wanna get down
(She wanna get down, she wanna get down)
When no one's around
(When no one's around, when no one's around)
She only wanna get down
(She wanna get down, she wanna get down)
When no one's around
(When no one's around, when no one's around)

[Verse 2]
But hypothetically if you and me were down to meet
Grab a slice of pizza, maybe watch a film that's features
What that can lead to maybe walks on Venice Beach
Overseas for Mona Lisa and leaning Tower of Piza
All because the change in season makes us need another reason
For you and me to sleep in from freaking in the evening
We can spark a little tree, talk about what we believe in
While you hanging just a t-shirt, kicking it all weekend

[Hook]
She only wanna get down
(She wanna get down, she wanna get down)
When no one's around
(When no one's around, when no one's around)
She only wanna get down
(She wanna get down, she wanna get down)
When no one's around
(When no one's around, when no one's around)

[Verse 3]
Okay I get it, I get it, don't let me pressure you
Expressing my affection for your special tune
I show my [?], I'm thinking that I'm special too
Either you're a blessing or a lesson, pick which one are you
I bet you twenty dollars found onside of [?]
That I used to buy a bottle of tequila [?]
Margarita or a shot of
You feel a little lotto lucky
You can hit me up, we just wanna bust a nut

[Hook]
She only wanna get down
(She wanna get down, she wanna get down)
When no one's around
(When no one's around, when no one's around)
She only wanna get down
(She wanna get down, she wanna get down)
When no one's around
(When no one's around, when no one's around)
