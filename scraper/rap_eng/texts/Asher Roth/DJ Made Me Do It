[Intro: Shontelle]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Shontelle]
Seven in the morning (morning)
Seven messages on my cell phone
Already know who's calling (calling)
I better get home
I'm innocent (innocent)
It wasn't my fault
DJ had me caught up
I said baby, please believe me before you stop and start screaming
I know you see my make up running, but I swear I got a reason
Me and my girls went to the disco
I know I told you I'd come right back
But as soon as I heard that good music
I just didn't know how to act
So listen to me now

[Chorus: Shontelle]
Ohh
The DJ made me do it babe, hey
Ohh, the DJ made me do it babe, whoo!
DJ made, D-DJ made me do it, babe
DJ made, D-DJ made me do it, babe
Listen to me now

[Verse 2: Shontelle]
The drinks just started flowing
And the party, baby, didn't want to end
Guess I'm just a slave to the dance floor
Love at first hand; it had me all night long
I'm innocent (I'm innocent)
It wasn't my fault (whoa)
DJ had me caught up

[Bridge: Shontelle]
I said baby, please believe me before you stop and start screaming
I know you see my make up running, but I swear I got a reason
Me and my girls went to the disco
I know I told you I'd come right back
But as soon as I heard that good music
I just didn't know how to act
So listen to me now

[Chorus: Shontelle]
Ohh, the DJ made me do it babe, hey
Ohh, the DJ made me do it babe, whoo!
(Come on, baby, it wasn't my fault)
DJ made, D-DJ made me do it, babe
(Dj made me so it baby)
(Come on, baby, it wasn't my fault)
DJ made, D-DJ made me do it, babe

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
Yeah
Ah yes, T.G.I.F
I needa let it go, forget no stress
No need to be at home with a role instead
And my favorite DJ's on the one, two step
No sweat, I'mma have to go get
Checking out the girl in the tight black dress
And when she bends to the music it's sex
Can't wait to find out what he's gonna play next
My dance move is a little rick move
With a little two step and a bit of boom boom
So cruel that we moving the room
Shoot, look what the DJ made me do

[Chorus: Shontelle]
(Come on baby) the DJ made me do it, babe
(You know I love you, I'd never hurt you)
The DJ made me do it, babe (No, no, no, hey, hey)
DJ made, D-DJ made me do it, babe
(DJ made me do it, baby)
(You know I'd never lie to you, I promise)
DJ made, D-DJ made me do it, babe
It wasn't my fault
