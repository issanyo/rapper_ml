I got that single out now
Check itunes if you don't know
Yeah i said go down low
$7.99 for the hoe

In the bread aisle i'll be asleep
Went number 5 in just a week
Now i get boom boom boom
Yeah real good boom boom boom
Brain bang!

I got that boom boom pow
Them chickens jackin' my style
They try to copy my swagger
Im on that next shit now

Im so 3000 and AY!
You so 2000 and STRAIGHT!
I got that Boom boom boom
That future boom boom

Bring it back now
Get it. Get it
Gotta get that album y'all
Gotta get that Asleep In The Bread Aisle
BUT
Gotta get that
Get it. Get it

DJ Wreckineyez

Im on that supersonic boom
And headin' straight to outterspace
The the the smartest in the room
You see the glasses on my face

Yeah Wreckineyez is a dork
But london girls think im cute
Yorkshire pudding with a fork
Sip sipping on that jake McMuel

Girls go fuck when you turn me on
When Brain dances we say pause
Get loose out here with zeus
And mix that juice up with this goose now

We got the beat that bounce
She got the boobs that bounce
Diva's in mauvida, When I be in London Town

People in the place, If you came to get down
People put your hands in the air
Kevin with, drop the beat now

I'll be rockin' them beats
I'll be rockin' them beats

Here we go, here we go
All up in your radio
One hittin' y'all with the boom boom
DJ Wreckineyez, Bangley, Ash Roth
Kevin's y'all with the boom boom
BBC won't let me say
Please just let me say
Still i need my Visa, so you know i take it easy on ya
C'mon

Get it. Get it
Let the beat rock
DJ Wreckineyez on the 1's and 2's
L-l-l-let the beat rock
Ash Roth. Live Lounge
Let the beat rock
Yo i'll be bumpin' bumpin'
We love you
Smooth it out
Smooth it out now

I like that boom boom pow
Them chickens jackin' my style
They try to copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now

I'm so 3000 and AY!
You so 2000 and STRAIGHT!
I got that boom boom bomm
That future boom boom boom

C'mon, Get it. Get It
Gotta get that. Gotta get that
Gotta get that, Gotta get that Album
