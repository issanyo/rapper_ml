Asher Roth:
Give me 25 minutes and I'll be right back
I need a round of calisthenics and a real quick nap
See I'm tired I've been driving all up over the map
To show the whole entire county that it's bigger than rap
But the thing is with these people they don't even react
They wanna see the main event and you the opening act
And if you don't know what you're doing then you ruin your chance
Cuz they booing what you screwing up and doing your dance

When Im moving and grooving I'm attracting the chicks
Like this rapping is an aphrodisiac with a bitch
And I'm not exactly strapping more the caddy kid from happy
But the simple fact I'm rapping has me apple bottom tapping
But uh.. ain't no daddies told me how to get down
I won't have this chatty Kathy just because she's got a mouth
Yo I'd rather hit up red two bitches and do it myself
Than have a stupid fucking groupie go and ruin my health

I don't need no stid (STD), I don't need no kid
I don't need no B where my credo is
Please don't leave lone won't be no shit
We no he's broke won't see no hits
See no evil video tricks
Free gold? Me? No so please don't dig
Me don't give no two freeload chicks
Okay, one freeload but see that's it
Better leave to the streets won't be no tip
No whip no week Mexico trip
No please don't speak don't need no lip
Zip it, Jimmeny Crick, Lickety Split
Snip snip snippin' a tip, quicker than quick
Flip shit, rippin' a hip, sicker than pick
Mr. Mix with some liquor like a rip of romance
Yeah, you love it when I'm rumpin' just don't bump on my shit
