Hello, you can start recording me at any time
Yo, I got something in my...
I need some water or something man
I got something in my fuckin, in my teeth
Ready? Alright cool

I'm here for the, fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers
For the guilty, the innocent citizens, and the immigrants
If you, ain't listen you're missin out
Bear witness to the realist style. (I bet they listenin now)
If my voice didn't work, but my hands could talk?
Would you take the time to see what a deaf man thought?
I could be alone and homeless
Hurt won't heal, but my cardboard's signed, so my words are real
Would you stop to drop change? Or stop for a change?
Engage in conversation, and exchange names?
Or maybe you would listen if my image was a bitch?
Big lips and bigger tits show you what real sex is. But?
What if, I was picked for grave? Sick for days? Aged to be sick with aids?
Would you listen to my story that I swear is touching
Or just, blank stare cause you're scared to touch me?
If I'm, Jewish or Christian does it affect your decision to
See past religion and simply listen to wisdom?
Would you, really listen to my views on the government
If my, raps were democrat and yours are republican?
Whether I'm black or white, gay, straight, hermaphrodite
Half the time trash the light and we all act alike
So, pass the mic, don't assist being ignorant
Unclench your fist for a bit and just listen
