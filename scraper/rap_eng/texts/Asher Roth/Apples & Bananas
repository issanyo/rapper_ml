[Hook]
I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas
I like to oh, oh, oh, opples and bononos
I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas
I like to oh, oh, oh, opples and bononos

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Holy smokes artichoke, art of Mozart
Sharpen note, poptart, part Hall and Oates (Hall and Oates)
Heart of coal, Ã  la carte, de la mode, De La Soul, de la woah
Yo that Roth kid can go (he can go)
De la flow, daylight come, she go home
We got stoned, she got flown tho so I got dome (I got dome)
HAHA-YO, this is corner liquor store
Flick my bic and bitch and moan, switching pictures pitch is low (pitch is low)
Sit your slow ass down, a-bow bow
I Ron Browz with pants down all around town (around town)
So So-Cal there's no doubt I know now
Grow your own style, yo, right about now

[Hook]
I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas
I like to oh, oh, oh, opples and bononos
I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas
I like to oh, oh, oh, opples and bononos

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
Pop a chakra, pop, lock, and drop it
Block block, get off him Rock n Jock was awesome
Talk to John Carson, clock stops the ball, son
Pause... Who died and left Charles in charge?
Let me borrow your car, bring it back tomorrow unscarred
In the garden of art, startled dog caught me off guard
D-d-d, darn it Mercutio, dookie chain, Gucci flow
Hootie blows fish, thought I really love sushi though (no she don't)
Never on the first date anyway
Used to bang groupie hoes, Now I'm in a better place (better rate)
Better late than never better set 'er straight
Meditate to center Eddie Vedder needs a better mate (better man)
Better stay, settle for the lesser pay
Like the sweater weather but I still believe in yesterday (what's today?)
What's-his-face must've missed the bus but hey
Fuck it what's the rush? We gon' walk it up the other way

[Hook]
I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas
I like to oh, oh, oh, opples and bononos
I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas
I like to oh, oh, oh, opples and bononos
