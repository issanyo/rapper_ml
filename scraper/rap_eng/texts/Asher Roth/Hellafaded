You're girl playing you she all up on a speed date

Gimme that watch, gimme that ring, and whatever else bling
It's that 2-11 music bitch you know what I mean
And if you ever come to my city you know who my team is
Willy, Magic, Kareem, Byron Scott on the wing, man
I'm clean, I'm shinin', I sparkle like a diamond
Been running this for years, nigga, I should win the Heisman
She love it, she like, she said I am the flyest
So she put it in fifth gear any time I let her ride it

It's getting, It's getting, It's getting kinda nasty
One blunt rolled, other one where my stash be
In the game, something like Milton Bradley
Old school nigga, man I still roll up black street
We go back like hot wheel tracks
In the box heels back, bring that Pac feel back
Fuck around, get your top peeled back
Niggas drop real rap we don't want none of that

First off Ash Roth says fuck the game
I've been a bum for a month and I still ain't changed
I got clothes with some holes and they still all stained
But I will show up to your show and then steal the stage
Yeah the crowd getting buck like they couldn't get enough
Everybody in the front do the guido fist pump
I be humpin' on a bum, she got junk up in the trunk
Like I met her in Miami hanging on the bang bus
I be playing in them panties like my man Brain does
And they kick it to the corner right when the brain done
They be calling up my celly (cell phone) I just fucking hang up
I be wifin' up a muffin who just went and gave it up
I'm straight, I'm young, I'll wait, not done
Put your titties in my face, play the nipple with my tongue
It's my favorite instrument, I like to practice when I'm drunk
So pour up a shot of remmy and roll up another blunt!
