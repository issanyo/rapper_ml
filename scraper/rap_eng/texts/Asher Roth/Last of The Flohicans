[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Last of the Flohicans
Goin' for no reason
Snowing for four seasons
Fucked up my whole weekend
I was home, chiefin' dro, in the zone
Peaking slow, sippin', couch surfing
Ouch, feeling so sheepish
That's so facetious, or is it so fictitious
I lost focus selfishly with the leeches
When I sleep why do I see what it is I don't believe in?
Thought I was hopeful but there's hope for only those who leaving

[Hook: Major Myjah]
It's all up to you
It's not what we do
Just find the truth
Its all out of focus, focus
Up to you, its not what we do
Just find the truth
Its all out of focus, focus

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
Need a new beginning, let me start again and
Let me start again, this time without an awkward ending
I walk pretending my thoughts are other on this planet
But I abandoned them not long ago and left them stranded
Don't understand it, take for granted, might resort to panic
But, there's a chance that you're enchanted, might be worth the manage
No need for fantasy, fancy I'm not a stuffed guy
Don't puff my chest out, not impressed with dumb lies
I'm stumped (Why?), on how the well dries up
Leaves the whole entire countryside left to fry
I testify, and to the best of my abilities
Silly me knows, it really should be left to God

[Hook: Major Myjah]
It's all up to you
It's not what we do
Just find the truth
Its all out of focus, focus
Up to you, its not what we do
Just find the truth
Its all out of focus, focus

[Post-Hook: Major Myjah]
Up to you, about what we do
If your sky is blue
Just find the focus, focus

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
It's bad time and I'm flat lining
It's hard finding the fine line
Dividing child from aged shaman
It ain't that common, not every day
You see the latest fate
Disintegrate and regenerate in better shape
Stay in the shade, keep the pain away
Or take a break long enough to make them say
Live in your heart and not your head stupid
When the lens crooked, make your amends, don't take offense to it
Making friends through it, when it bends and loops
Ending up pretending, leaping through the hoops to get into
Better check your fluids, get a rest to ruin
Better them than me, it's me or them, that's why the best just do it

[Hook: Major Myjah]
It's all up to you
It's not what we do
Just find the truth
Its all out of focus, focus
Up to you, its not what we do
Just find the truth
Its all out of focus, focus

[Post-Hook: Major Myjah]
Up to you, about what we do
If your sky is blue
Just find the focus, focus
