Take me as I am my friends, ain't going to change
Won't be no Em, rock these songs
Rock these shows, only good life I know

(Asher Roth)
I was in seventh grade when I heard The Slim Shady LP
Yeah, my mom brought it down when I was ironing; irony
Getting out the wrinkles, just a little kid in middle school
Sink my teeth in anything to think I'm cool, riding the bus
I feel the rush from I "Still Don't Give A Fuck"
Yeah, I wish I could agree but I've already had enough
I've already given up from playing the same game
Every interview I feel like I'm saying the same thing, like
Em was great, yeah, he paved the way for me
He was inspiration for everybody from A to Z
But they keep relating me, I can't get away
Chasing me (all day long) I hear it (all day long)
And now the masters thinks that Asher wants to be a Marshall Mathers
They say, "Asher's not a rapper, nah, he's actually just a actor"
'Cause we have the same complexion and similar voice inflection
It's easy to see the pieces and reach for that connection
Each second, every minute, each hour of everyday
I'm constantly on the fence defending my own name
Explaining we are not the same
Not much that I can say, except I'm sick of it
Critics arrantly sparked up a flame, it's on

(Chester French)
Take me as I am my friends, ain't going to change
Won't be no Em, rock these songs
Rock these shows, only good life I know

Take me as I am my friends, ain't going to change
Won't be no Em, rock these songs
Rock these shows, only good life I know

(Asher Roth)
Now don't get it twisted, I've definitely benefitted
It's like suddenly everyone wants to hear what I be spitting
It's so different, the image they don't get it
It's simple I'm just a kid who wants to rap to make a living
But Em was in it way before I committed
And his lyrics were the shit so I really got to come with it
But each critic been picking apart my writtens
And if it's not up to par then Asher's Paul is just a gimmick
Is it my fault must I be more convincing?
Ya'll talk all you want, never halt me from my mission
Using his ammunition, would you please keep dissing me?
(All day long) I hear it (all day long)
And yeah, the haters want to hate because I made it and I'm famous
But until you take my place you'll never know 'bout what it takes to make a record for respect, take a second to inspect
When you look like someone else then what the fuck do you expect?
I just want to be accepted as the illest in the game
But it's harder for an artist creating his own lane
That's synonymous with his rhyming and combine with perfect timing
All the time all that's declining and about to explode

(Chester French)
Take me as I am my friends, ain't going to change
Won't be no Em, rock these songs
Rock these shows, only good life I know

Take me as I am my friends, ain't going to change
Won't be no Em, rock these songs
Rock these shows, only good life I know

(Asher Roth)
Yeah, yeah
So fuck it that's all I got, there's nothing else for me to say
If I don't confront the problem it will never go away
Unless it is addressed there is nothing left for me to do
It's impossible rejecting an elephant in the room
Say goodbye to all the bullshit, notions preconceived
So long to all the blogs, could have swore they knew me
If you have no further questions and can't think of other thoughts
Then let me introduce you to Asher Paul Roth... gone

(Chester French)
Take me as I am my friends, ain't going to change
Won't be no Em, rock these songs
Rock these shows, only good life I know

Take me as I am my friends, ain't going to change
Won't be no Em, rock these songs
Rock these shows, only good life I know

Yeah, yeah
