[Verse 1]
Hey baby, it's all gravy, we all crazy
It's not you, it's me? That's what they all say
But could you leave me alone? This be my off day
Please don't tweet, don't text, don't call me
I need space and some room to breathe
Kick my shoes off, chill, and just shoot the breeze
Little margarita or a daiquiri
And I can't enjoy that if you hassle me
And last night it was really a blast
That flat little tummy and magnificent ass
You a bad little mami with some style and sass
But you blowin' up my phone makes me sick of you fast
All emotion aside, you need to hide that
Please girl, don't be a venus flytrap
If you see me on the streets, give a, "Hi Ash"
Then keep it movin' and then maybe I'd be right back

[Hook]
Lemme get some space
Yesterday was great
Girl get out of my way
I ain't fuckin' with you
Lemme get some space
Yesterday was great
Girl get out of my way
I ain't fuckin' with you

[Verse 2]
We just young and we havin' some fun
Just because I let you hump doesn't make you the one
I'mma take a vaca and no you can't come
Spend a few days alone on a island with sun
Let me chill for a bit and get my head straight
Get out the way or just catch a little head fake
Spin move, stiff arm like an ESPY
I'm not playin' little lady, don't test me
Come on girl, you know clingin' ain't cool
You be all up in my face, you be breakin' the rules
I mean how much can I take when you actin' a fool?
See I don't want to hate, there's no need to be rude, but
Yeah, this my space, you should respect that
And always know patience makes sex last
Don't be afraid, you could say, "You the best, Ash"
Then keep it movin' and then maybe I'd be right back

[Hook]
Lemme get some space
Yesterday was great
Girl get out of my way
I ain't fuckin' with you
Lemme get some space
Yesterday was great
Girl get out of my way
I ain't fuckin' with you
Lemme get some space
Yesterday was great
Girl get out of my way
I ain't fuckin' with you
Lemme get some space
Yesterday was great
Girl get out of my way
I ain't fuckin' with you
