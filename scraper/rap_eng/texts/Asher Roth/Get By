[Chorus]
I've been drinking a lot
I've been smoking a lot
I know I will get by
I'm gonna make it this time
I've been drinking a lot
I've been smoking a lot
I know I will get by
I'm gonna make it this time

[Verse]
Drink my drink
Smoke my weed
Laying low
Floating free
I'll tell you like they told me
Your money doesn't grow on trees
If it did I'd be good
I'd be rich
I'd be set
I'd be in some island with vagina, high nah, sipping red
But instead paying rent
Money spent
Money lent
Money ends a couple friends
Yo what the fuck it don't make sense
Smoke a joint
Let it be
Let it breathe
Let it free
Let the beat be telling me
Exactly what supposed to be

[Chorus]
I've been drinking a lot
I've been smoking a lot
I know I will get by
I'm gonna make it this time
I've been drinking a lot
I've been smoking a lot
I know I will get by
I'm gonna make it this time

[Bridge]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, roll up, roll up, roll up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, roll up, roll up, roll up

[Chorus]
I've been drinking a lot
I've been smoking a lot
I know I will get by
I'm gonna make it this time
I've been drinking a lot
I've been smoking a lot
I know I will get by
I'm gonna make it this time
