[Intro: Asher Roth]
You're like a one year old bro
Yeah, well you're like a nine year old
Yeah, well at least I know shit
Here's a— (x11)

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Here's a different perspective
My best shit comes when I least expect it
My concerts blood tears and sweat shit
My contents been pure neglected, but
I guess I need to be less domestic (true)
I tend to rest in the nest and just think 'bout
That's where it all gets a bit messy
I'll be all stressed trying to be impressive like
I need to be the best no exceptions so
When I blow up those expect me to
And the flow oh so perfected
Flow the freshest so so infectious tell
Tell the rest can agree nobody better than Ash
No rest, no breathe 'til I'm making it happen
You know the fact, yeah veteran act
Yeah impression, that whenever I rap
I'm tremendous when I'm putting every letter intact
That's when it all crashes, ashes to ashes
Fall flat smack dab right on my ass, and
The glass shatters and it shattered on the floor
And everything you thought of doesn't matter anymore
It's erratic, only static when grammatic from your pore
It's as bad as if a rapper didn't have metaphor (whats a metaphor?)
A metaphor a dinner that is never poured
Triple what I ordered, yo I think I need a better four
But of course only on the first course, par four
Four more tell when I can call—four!
Playing horse I already have hor—
Need a miracle and so I heave it up from half court
Im heating up A. Roth small forward
I wanna cross-over ever since I saw Jordan, but
Now I'm torn wanna be more Bird
33 so mean on that green uniform, but
Really what I means and it seems I've learned
I can only be me, I can be no more
When I'm free, I'm pure, When I speak I'm sure
That everything released comes deep from the core
Like back in ’04 way 'fore I scored a single that had lingered
And got us on tour I would rap for a laugh
Rap just to passin' the time and
Then passin' the rhyme to the left
Got signed and forget how to rhyme and direct like
From the feeling from the feelings that I get
So back to the back to the basics
White t-shirt and some mother fucking Asics
Ay bitch this is the rebirth of the greatest
Famous name and it starts with an A it's—Ash Roth!
