[Hook]
Love is like an undertow
Pull me under, never let me go
We can try to t-t-take it slow
But love is like an undertow

[Verse 1]
I just wanna be your type
I just wanna be the only one
They say it'll be your life
I just wanna be there when the come up
I just wanna be your type
I just wanna be the only one
They say it'll be your life
I just wanna be there when the sun come up

[Pre-Hook]
I don't wanna be there, be there
I don't wanna be your plan B
I don't wanna hear that, hear that
There's one like me
I don't wanna be there, be there
I don't wanna be your plan B
I don't wanna hear that, hear that
There's one like me

[Hook]
Love is like an undertow
Pull me under, never let me go
We can try to t-t-take it slow
But love is like an undertow

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
What am I to do now
Feels like I'm getting pulled down
Feel like I'm bout to drown trying to hold out
I mean girl wow, you're so magnetic
Dare I said it, your mom must've been athletic
I ain't mean that
I just mean that you're a dream in a Jeep with a seat back
While we looking at the stars above
Am I in love? Feels like the start of it honestly
Keep thinking bout us on the beach
The other fish from the farther sea, they don't belong to me
Heart skips when you on the scene
Real cool, it be hard to keep
Hard to breathe
Pretty girl go easy
Faithful meeting even if for an evening
I'ma let you take control, break the fall
Ride your wave, whichever way it goes

[Hook]
Love is like an undertow
Pull me under, never let me go
We can try to t-t-take it slow
But love is like an undertow

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna sleep alone tonight girl
I just wanna let you know
I don't wanna see you on the site, no
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna sleep alone tonight girl
I just wanna let you know
I don't wanna see you on the site, no

[Pre-Hook]
I don't wanna be there, be there
I don't wanna be your plan B
I don't wanna hear that, hear that
There's one like me
I don't wanna be there, be there
I don't wanna be your plan B
I don't wanna hear that, hear that
There's one like me

[Hook]
Love is like an undertow
Pull me under, never let me go
We can try to t-t-take it slow
But love is like an undertow
