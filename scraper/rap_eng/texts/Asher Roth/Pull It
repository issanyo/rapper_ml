[Chorus]
One finger in the air just like this
One finger in the air and I’m gon’ pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull
One finger in the air just like this
One finger in the air and I’m gon’ pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull
One finger in the air just like this
One finger in the air and I’m gon’ pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull

[Verse 1]
She made me do it, no, I won’t complain
I won't make excuses, I know I won’t change
Call me fucking stupid, did it all in vain
Why do I keep pursuing? Searching off again
Old Information, I ain’t good at relationships
I ain't no angel, but no, you never gave a shit
And I’m gon’ make it, I try to walk away from it
But separated, you call my name, it makes me sick

[Chorus]
One finger in the air just like this
One finger in the air and I’m gon’ pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull
One finger in the air just like this
One finger in the air and I’m gon’ pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull
One finger in the air just like this
One finger in the air and I’m gon’ pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull

[Verse 2]
Far to the right
Gone to the break of dawn, off for the night
Lost in a vacant lot, parked on a light
Crossed and it's shaking, too long of a fight
All of my might, call her I might
Know that I shouldn’t cause its hard to be nice
Always gotta pick it when the arguments right
Stars and the stripes
Talk from the heart, make me larger than life
Aw, beep beep, knees deep in a DC
Please need these demons to leave me
Need peace, no reason to repeat
Retreat, it’s easy, just release
Relief, be free, let it go
Fiening a leaf, ain't no need to control
Planting a seed, let me reap what I sow
Defeated the pieces he blow, pow

[Chorus]
One finger in the air just like this
One finger in the air and I’m gon’ pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull
One finger in the air just like this
One finger in the air and I’m gon’ pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull
One finger in the air just like this
One finger in the air and I’m gon’ pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
One finger in the air just like this
One finger in the air and I’m gon’ pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull
One finger in the air just like this
One finger in the air and I’m gon’ pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull
One finger in the air just like this
One finger in the air and I’m gon’ pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull it
Yes, I’m gon’ pull it, yes, I will pull
