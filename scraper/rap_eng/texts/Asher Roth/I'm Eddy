[Intro: Asher Roth]
You know, there comes a time when you need to mature a bit
And not like all the way, but you just need to grow up a little bit
And make some better decisions
I'm better right now so I feel like this

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Yeah man I've been fucking around
Smoking blunts, getting drunk, put on a couple of pounds
But nowadays with responsibilities
I respond by turning on my adult abilities
With routines and new ways to approach things
Like reading books and buying more groceries
I'll emphasize on diet and exercise
I'm trying to get outside every once and awhile
And like, play some tennis man
I was good when I was 10
But then again I really haven't played since
And, like my chess game - my defense lame
Same as my handle if I made it to the lane
Cause I'm too soft and my jay's a little off
But in football I am Fred Biletnikoff
Or Steve Largent, a smaller target
Bossed up the backyard, thanks to my father
So Ed McCaffrey is probably my favorite athlete
He or Marcus Allen yo that running back was nasty
Me, Marc Lemke, played 'till I was 17
Second in center then cut from JV
That's when I found beats and when I found weed
Smoke, rap, rap, eat, eat, smoke, rap heat
18, that's me - earings, CZ(?)
All clothes baggy, dressed so badly
But, now I'm older I'm foldin' over just laughin'
Laughing at my stupid ass like "Damn, I can't believe that's Asher", but
That's what happens man
You gotta go through all the roles so you can grow
And then come into your own
But now I'm ready show the world what I've become
I'm going for sort of Brad Pitt in Fight Club
So, I jump rope, do yoga - down dog
I don't lift weights, nah, I really hate to jog
But what's more important than endorphins?
Tony Horton got me snortin' 'till I can thwart Norton
Man, fuck the sore shit, the pain is good
Makes the hate go away - a new day understood
And, I'm feeling fresh man
I'm feeling blessed man
I feel I can appreciate a deep breath and
And I confess I love the weed
She's my sweet sweet Sheeva
That's sexy sativa
But I think it's time just for a little bit
To resign from getting high cause homie this is it
It's 2010 last chance to make myself
I plan to have a fam' and start expanding on my wealth
I can't do it being stupid watching movies and the news
About how a rumor it'd be cooler to work for you - screw that
I'd rather be shackled than do rap that didn't matter
Yeah I'm happy that I've taken on the path that's less traveled
So fuck the drugs man
I need my lungs
Spread the message to the next man
That respecting is expected
No matter what your ethnic, sex, or sex preference
From peasants to the Reverend's to the ex-convicted felons
We're all connected man, energetically
And I say that the risk of sounding deep
But I suggest you correct your head and neck
That reflects the physicals and the spirituals is next
And that's where we twist it with different religions
Everything is linked if you just start from the beginning
It's science and politics
Negatives and positives
Took the negs and positives
And now I got a lot to give
