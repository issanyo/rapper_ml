Roth

[Hook: Asher Roth]
Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fuck
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and actin' up
Actin', actin' up, actin', actin' up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and actin' up

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Here I go, yeah yo, what's the scenario?
Can't understand, what you starin' for? Like you've never seen a white boy dance before
But damn she fine, that's one chick I can stand behind
Play in my field like a dandelion, put it all on 'til you can't decide on
What's it gon' be? You, me, her, her, her, you, me
Girl, go beserk, gotta beat 'em with a tree, go ahead, fall back, need a boy gon' breathe
Ease off, back up, I'm about to act up, floatin', sippin', havin' fun 'cause I be young and actin' up
Actin', actin' up, actin', actin' up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and actin' up

[Hook: Asher Roth]
Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fuck
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and actin' up
Actin', actin' up, actin', actin' up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and actin' up

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
So I walked in the club with a dope hairdo, checkin' my fresh, everythin' brand new
Sexy old dude, sayin' "Who's you?" You do me and I'ma do you
What what, what you talkin' about Willis? Man fall back, I'm just chillin'
Hate when they check for a bad-bad bitch, gotta have respect for my bad habits
P-p, now pass me the tree, I'ma get wild, I'ma nail you to me
Pull out the camera and shoot me a links 'cause I'ma act up, sweetie pie, what you think?
Go insane in the membrane, brain do my thing thing, yeah talk my slang, come and hang with a real thing
Words of the same, shit of the same lovers, badder than a MJ level
Face down, ass up, skinnys on, dirty Chucks, showin' off, I'ma swag it up, good girl gone bad, boy grab my bud

[Hook: Asher Roth]
Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fuck
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and actin' up
Actin', actin' up, actin', actin' up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and actin' up

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
19 years old and I gotta act up 'cause I'm so so fly, yeah I'm so fly
And I don't know why, really know I, go so wow, 'til the bass goes oh my
Oh I, I gotta slow it down, yeah I'm on the loose, and I won't stop now
'Cause I go so loud, and I go so wow, so you better watch out 'cause I'm oh so ah
I'm on some risky business, I like women and French kisses
Mama told do the dishes but I'm out here catchin' fishes
'Cause I'm still young and actin' up, girls on my mind, so I still mack up
They see the money, see the money, rack up, 'til the walls dark green 'cause I'm stackin' up

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fuck
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and actin' up
Actin', actin' up, actin', actin' up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and actin' up

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
Yikes, I guess I'm actin' up, I'm about to go in, let me wrap it up
Y'all old school like Galaga, but I'ma call these shots, caliber
What it is JB? My Ray-Bans in my jacket might give you rabies
My chain heavy, give it to the ladies, DJ hold up, hold up, watch 'em go crazy
Chillin' with Asher Roth, girls let me touch 'cause they ass is soft
Yes I'ma score with them basketballs, she gon' give it up, I don't pass at all
My crew neck match my two-step, I just had group sex on my new jet
So many pretty girl, I'm like "Who's next?" So drunk all my white friends like, "Do it"
Ease off, back up, I'm about to act up
Smokin', drinkin', havin' fun 'cause I be young and actin' up
Actin', actin' up, actin', actin' up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and actin' up

[Hook: Asher Roth]
Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fuck
They say I ain't old enough but I be young andactin' up
Actin', actin' up, actin', actin' up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and actin' up
