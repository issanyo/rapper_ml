[Hook: Fat Tony, Asher Roth]
All day, all day
She asks me what I'm doing all day
I told her I'm eating that sushi all day
I'll be eating that sushi all day
All day, all day
She asks me what I'm doing all day
I told her I'm eating that sushi all day
I'll be eating that sushi all day

[Bridge: Fat Tony]
I hope it's clean, I hope it's nice
I hope that sushi just right
I'ma eat it all day and all night
I'ma eat it all day and all night

[Verse 1: Fat Tony]
Every morning I delete my call log
Ball so hard, boys call me a ball hog
Yeah I hit it like a homer right up out the ballpark
Ride it like a go-kart
Eat it like a Poptart
The girl give me brain but she's not smart
She headed to my crib and I'm not far
I'm tryna get to know her like Nardwuar
Yeah I'ma dig up in it like an aardvark
Real G's move in silence like a fart
I ride the pony like Napol√©on Bonaparte
Might put it in the bootyhole
I eat it up like a tuna roll

[Hook: Fat Tony, Asher Roth]
All day, all day
She asks me what I'm doing all day
I told her I'm eating that sushi all day
I'll be eating that sushi all day
All day, all day
She asks me what I'm doing all day
I told her I'm eating that sushi all day
I'll be eating that sushi all day

[Bridge: Fat Tony]
I hope it's clean, I hope it's nice
I hope that sushi just right
I'ma eat it all day and all night
I'ma eat it all day and all night

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
Eating sush' around noon cause I'm in the mood
I don't know, not a whole lot to do
I'm kind of loose so I'm tryna get screwed
You're kind of cute so I'm tryna screw you
Calm and cool, Dalai Lama kind of dude
Avocado cucumber roll with the spicy tun'
But if you're tuna's spicy, then shoot...
I ain't tryna fuck with you, I got better shit to do
Fish to skew, fish to fry, fish filet
Ask me where I'm from, I say close to Philly
Yay hooray, moved to L.A
Took a trip to SUGARFISH on my very first date

[Hook: Fat Tony, Asher Roth]
All day, all day
She asks me what I'm doing all day
I told her I'm eating that sushi all day
I'll be eating that sushi all day
All day, all day
She asks me what I'm doing all day
I told her I'm eating that sushi all day
I'll be eating that sushi all day

[Bridge: Fat Tony]
I hope it's clean, I hope it's nice
I hope that sushi just right
I'ma eat it all day and all night
I'ma eat it all day and all night
