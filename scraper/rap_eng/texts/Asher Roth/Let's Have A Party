[Hook: Luke Christopher]
So let's have a party
Cuz everybody in here making love tonight
So find a bad chick and get naughty
Take her home and brake her off
And get in and get out
Baby lets party
We can hit the crib in Hollywood
Or we can go to Vegas and get married
We living the life
If we dying tomorrow
We living tonight

[Verse 1: Luke Christopher]
Now, I know it ain’t easy to save all that cash that you earned for working five days
But a nine to five pays for booze on Fridays
And plus you can afford to sleep in the next morning
And in a world where everybody’s conforming
I can be the uh, the one to weather the storm
Sometimes a conscious nigga need a shot
And a girl to ride smoother that these rappers Maybach’s
But nah, I’m exaggerating
When black girls telling me they glad I made it
And white girls telling me to make them famous
In the back of the whip while A Tribe is playing
But shit yea I can write a hit
But life’s a trip and niggas can't pack for years
So, go on and toast to money and fame
But me and my homies toast to the best in the game

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Asher Roth]
Yo, its such a beautiful world
And I want to spend it hanging with some beautiful girls
Cuz I’ve learned a few things like this world can change
And you get what you give it’s all about what you bring
A smile and a drink got me feeling alive
So let me tell you something homie, you only know if you try
When the going gets tough, take it a day at a time
All the haters that be hating I don’t pay them no mind
So let's party
Pour it up and roll up the Marley
Heading to the drive through shorty come shawty
Let me get a six piece and a junior bacon cheese
Feelin' loose feelin' free on the roofs smoking weed
Breath deep, always stare at the stars
Tripping out to think about that we are who we are
If we didn’t have each other the we wouldn’t get far
We better when we together so we might as well have a party

[Hook]

[4x]
Baby let me take you home
And we can get it on
I got Hennessey and gold Patron
And we can get it on
