[Verse 1: Kota the Friend]
Money power I'm watching 'em get devoured
We dodging the devil's offers I'm wallowin' in the flowers
It's sunny like every morning, good morning in California
I'm staying in Pasadena away from all of the nausea
Above it all, I'm asking for nothing more
Than peace of mind, and in return I'll keep it 100 raw
Out the sun roof, doin' 90 like fuck the law
And all the hatred they be sending to me I brush it off
I know it got you vexed cause you doubted me
I know you got it out for me
But know a lot of people in this motherfucker count on me
To be the voice of reason and be the person I'm bout to be
I should want revenge but yo it's not what it's about for me
Life above the politics flattered by every compliment
Used to be suicidal I'm happy that I'm alive and shit
JFK to LAX, call before I'm flying in
Sailing on the ocean of possible 'til I'm diving in

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
Amazed how one day I feel great, the next hazy
No wonder I feel crazy, wonder if they hear me praying
Laying ass for ambition, clarity understanding
Feeling like I'm not a man, they say when you lose a pair
And apparently I ain't there yet, living a life inherited
Glaring with many errors, farewell as far as fair is
But the fairest in the land, a question I ain't caring
Embarrassment to them, maybe it's all a plan
I feel I should just split to position of more patience
Reason for the frustration, travel to many places
On the way to Pasadena just to see the scenery
Hope to see the same in me, but where you go there you be
Stay or leave, A or B, I believe it's meant to be
Take a break to shake the bees, hope the vision will increase
It ain't easy being being, seems to be one of defeat
Hope to see you when I reach where those two sides meet
Until then
