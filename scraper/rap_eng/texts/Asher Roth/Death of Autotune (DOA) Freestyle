[Intro: Asher Roth]
The only rapper to...be an elementary school teacher

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Ash is back, suck my cul-de-sac
That goes for all those who pose like Spence Pratt
Whacks that can’t rap but they think they're the shit
When I’m hangin' out in Vegas, makin' out with ya sis
Ahh, fuck reality shows, it's sad to see the tragedy reality shows
Reality that rap ain't goin' platinum no mo'
So I have to find an avenue with rapping befo'
I got a warm fuzzy feelin when I'm flappin' the flow
Started with some cold chillin' and a tap of a toe
Now they tappin' my phone because Im rackin' up dough
And now that Asher is a factor they be at my back-do' (oh)
Dialogue with Viacom, playing X-Box with Megan Fox
Call of duty I fire bomb entire squads, R’s and Uzi’s
Riots on insider wars, beyond movies, (?)
I’d rather lose than fire shots, I power this youth
Who’d rather shoot than try and talk and get to the truth
You know I'm rooting my troops to keep trouping
We start a revolution simply through good music
Get used to it dufus and do new shit
You Reese Witherspoons is clueless
Oh shit
I’m silver stoned excuse me
Keep getting loose and syracuse is so soothing
But don’t confuse me, my jersey still say A. Roth
Or AKA "Never Take A Day Off"
Since Bernie Madoff, the banks would pay off
Our friends and our fans are the ones that's laid off
It's work, and no play, salad, and no steak
75 days straight with no (break!)
Ahh, pysche
I be chillin' be watchin' Ellen feedin' little kids lemons watch their face start swelling, up
Suck it up, pucker up, buttercup, when enough is enough, nip tuck it in the butt
Cause our asses are assets
Ash is invested in masses of massive, ashes to ashes
Ash is the master of ceremony no lonely island phony flowin' though I’m on a boat (mothafucka!)
In north cadillac, on the fourth hour shaft
My boy drinks Cris champagne off'a ass
I just laugh cause that’s actually true
You don’t believe that? Check it out on Youtube
Point a cam in the hand see the man Brain Bang
Check the rex in the decks while he chase after sex
This ones for Funk Flex, and the "Greenhouse Effect: Volume 2" is the truth
Got my penis erect

[Outro: Female and Asher Roth]
Female: "Uhh, Mr. Roth, you have a massive erection."
Asher: Don't act like you're not impressed
