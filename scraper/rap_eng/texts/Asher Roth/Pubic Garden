[INTRO]

Gettin' tired of this

I like the old clothes too. Especially that jumpsuit. Reebok. Yup

[VERSE 1: Asher Roth]

Wake up around 12 and I go back to sleep
Wake up around 3 and I make some green tea
Yo, I live alone so I sleep nakie
If it gets a little cold slip something on my feet

Got a pretty chick, pretty good at reggae
Tell her that my lower back's pretty achy

Wait I mean the weight's more on my shoulder blades
I been holding up these bolders for a couple hundred days

Confused and dazed, Matt McConaughey
You'd be way cooler only if you had a J

I play bongos in the middle of the night
Sitting indian position while I'm listening to tribe

A mild guy, never like to fight
Get up in my face, tell you go and fly a kite
Fight or flight and I'm higher than a Mike
Who took off from the line and then 3's all white

A little grey, little red, little black
Big brain, big head, big sack
No run straight, man zig zag
Or they'll shoot you in your face while you're playing laser tag

Tag, dog, you don't even know
You wanna see my skills, then let's go to ultra zone
Oh, no, you too busy getting dough?
More money, more bitches, no really, what fo'
Don't you know the whole world's about to blow up
And if it don't then invest in guns and golds, brah
Learn to grow your own vegetables
And maybe a couple fruits for early in the morning
Yeah, I like my fresh juice orange
Eggs fried, yolk broke, bread warm
Yeah, stretch my legs like I'm about to beat Bjorn
In the fucking French Open cause I got a good forehand

Damn, I'm lazy as fuck
I'd be the best rapper but I never get up
Lay in the cut, California King
With a middle age mistress missing her wedding ring
Cool Runnings on projector screens
Smoking weed that be ecto-green

Read Seventeen so it seems I'm in the scene
So I'm hitting on some teens at the ice-skating rink
Wink-wink, what it be sex-kitten?
Won't give you any fish, teach you how to go fishing
How to do dishes, keep the sink glistening
Can't stand the cups when they're dirty in the kitchen
So pardon, while I drink out of the carton
Letting out a fart, itching on my pubic garden

Darn it, took it a little too far
And now we have to cut you off right after this next part

Don't call me, just text
2 balls, don't forget
Ash Roth, know I'm the best yet
At TJ Maxx pickin' out a bedset
