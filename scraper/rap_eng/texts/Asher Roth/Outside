[Verse 1]
The last thing I wanna be is rapping
Rather be outside in the green grassy
Climb trees, maybe play ball basket
I got two feet, I don't need no taxi
Relaxing underneath the sky so blue
When the suns so warm, there's so much I wanna do
But locked in a studio while outside is beautiful
All the fresh air you can't get inside a cubicle
Turn off the computer yo, use your own noodle bro
We can do whatever we want, it's up to you to know
Go out with your friends man, stop pressing send
Cuz when this world ends all theres left is the mem-ories
Go ahead and have some adventure please
Ever since the turn of the century, people lose in touch of the beat
So put your hands out, feel the breeze, feel the heat cuz

[Chorus]
I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and stop to see your day
I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and stop to see your day

[Verse Two]
The more we're cooped up, we become loose nuts
But when we do stuff maybe we can loosen up
And stop stressing over things they depressing
Cuz that freshness is a delicatessen
Fruits and veggies, two scoops of blessing
Food is the truth oops a new lesson
Learn from it's your stomach, if your bumming
It's probably cuz the food ain't from the earth cousin
Work's something that you should enjoy usually boy
But now it's amazing if you was employed
So, keep it moving find the things in the foil
And boo the oil, what's important is the soil
No more murder, keep it fertile, jump the hurdles
Even pace it like a turtle, still make it to the pearly white gates
What a wait to escape from the haze and the hate
And the pain and everything goes away, so

[Chorus]
I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and stop to see your day
I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and stop to see your day
