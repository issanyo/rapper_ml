[Hook - Asher Roth,(ZZ Ward)]
Thinking bout the
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Got me feeling wishful
Thinking bout the
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Parties at the Disco
If i could fly, I would fly
I would fly, I would fly away
From here (here)
(You might get ugly, just because it's hard to make ends meet
But all the money don't mean shit
If you ain't here with me)

[Verse 1 - Asher Roth]
Cause the cash rules everything around
So, every now and then
Feeling like I'm out of town
Got a chill, sit down, remember how to be a child
Wide eyes with a smile
What? When? Where? How?
Styles of nostalgic
Lisp and a cowlick
Jumped to the moon
With a spoon and a spatula
Trapped in the past
Thinking how do we get back to it
Got that funny, funny feeling at last

[Hook]
Feeling like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Caught me feeling wishful
Thinking bout the
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Parties at the Disco
If I could find, I would find
I would find, I would find a way
My dear (my dear)
(You might get ugly, just because it's hard to make ends meet
But all the money don't mean shit
If you ain't here with me)

[Verse 2 - Asher Roth]
Yeah
To get some, you give some
So pick one
Lose some, you win some
So have fun
Don't stress, or do flips
Just press on
Mood twists, the shoe fits
So step on
Keep walking down the path that you meant for
Dog barking at the cat is essential
We will always come back to the threshold
But, first
You gotta let go
