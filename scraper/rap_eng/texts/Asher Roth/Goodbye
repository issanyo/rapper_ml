Fuck that, woadie
You want your joints be hot? Then let me rap on it
I'll be the cream of the crop
Jimmy got crack corn
I do this hippity-hop shit with a cast on
Sipping my flask dogg
This be Ash Roth
And there's a couple of cats that I should ash on
So go and roll me a joint, make it a fat one
And tell your homies the live spittin is back on
Yeah I'm back dogg, holding my sack hard
You act hard, but aren't shit, I'm an artist
You park cars for part shifts
Armpits, large park, hardly miss, start to finish
Blow you apart with starships
Playing Starfox, Black Ops on black tops
Hot black socks when camouflage won't hide ya
I'm a cyclops when I bop, I find ya
One shot lift your Waka Flocka top

Steinbock meets Einstein, rhymes is mindfuck
Mine luck as 9 lives dies: your time's up
9 bro, I shine, blind bind and hind luck
Don't choke, you old folk, bloaky grind shmuck
John Kruk in the motherfucker, one nut bustin on em
Kumquat suckin on em, gums got nothin on em, punks stop frontin on em
Dude is the one, sonRunyun kunyun motha pum pum
No pun, Roy Munson, Kingpin and big tin
Pinky ring, bling-bling, thinking I should sing sing
Oh shoot, ding-ding, tell him what he wins wins
Brand new bar with Kanye’s girlfriend
You pass it up, ass and all, gotta take my jacket off
Leono DiCaprio quit to play basketball
Reincarnated into Asher Paul, Asher Roth
Came back to rippin asshole into all ya’ll
