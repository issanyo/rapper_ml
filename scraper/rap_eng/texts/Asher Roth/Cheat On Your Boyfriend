But maybe not today, let me take the percalate, work your hips in the circle shape
That's good, right there like that
Hold that I'll be right back
Next chick that acted all affectionate, hitting bout sex and I hope she ain't affected

I know I look good, but it ain't that easy. I want nice things, but I ain't that sleazy. (Hell no). You talk like you want to please me, real slick like, real greasy. I know I be the one you choose, but I got a man I ain't trying to lose. (Hell no). Let it just do the do, I ain't trying to leave the club in the back of your
