[Intro: Asher Roth]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Ayo styles upon styles upon style upon styles
Ain't seen a blond this hot since Barb Wire
Since Limewire been downloading illegally
Ain't bought a CD since like 2003
Nah everything's speeding
Gravity in 3D
Many think we cheated and beat it with Game Genie
PlayStation triple play '98
New York Yanks, San Diego Padres
Nowadays everybody on a X-Box
Generation X triple H trying to X pop
Let's smoke pot while we guessing who's the next Pac
Best top, left breast, save it for the desktop
Rest stop while the truckers getting liquorish
Hard to give a fuck when you barely even give a shit
Look at me I'm egotist
Sipping on that regal piss
Doing shit illegal, get a giggle, hearing people bitch

[Verse 2: Chuck Inglish]
Detroit Fitted
Put a slight bend in my bill
Black Grand National turnin' twisting my wheel
The heavy-handed when I whip
The full clip when I steer
The Helly Hansen bubble fitted, case it's chilly in here
Rest in peace Uncle Phil, the Big Willy, the Wheel of Fortune
The real deal bruh's really doing numbers
Poyz and Pirlz jumper with the Air Max runner
This Summer... The '97 Hummer
When Nas was "Esco," roll up the petro
The Pelle Pelle retro
"Phone Tap" in the deck though...
On the set though...

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
You get no respect hoe
Presto, bless the Pats without Bledsoe
This was '94 bet that I'd be signed to Death Row
Flying in to Heathrow heat row jet though
Best rolled, sip red cup with Manseco

[Verse 4: Sir Michael Rocks]
Man this how it's about to go down
My yayo in a snow mound
I swan dived into it, the time bomb temperament
I got make you wanna keep a bigger badder master
To rip into your ass if you think about some action
Splash 'em
Baby Busch Garden at the crib
Keep the lemur in the living room
I know where you live nigga
You ain't even got no WiFi
Linguine with the vodka sauce Blanco Willy Wonka
Pocket down Diddy in the middle of his concert
While lifting up some titties so big they make my arms hurt
Finally Fantasy update on the X-Box 3
Take a hour and a half, take a shower and a bath
And a walk around the park and the shits still ain't stop yet
Anniversary boxset edition I got
Cost 11 hundred dollars and I'm missing some shit
