Oh my god! Yaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!
Oh yeahhh! Oh my god yeahh!
This is awesome! Soo awesome! (Yaaaahhhhh!)
CANNON! (CANNON!)

They know me, this yo I spit like a little kid
Rap thinks I?m a dirty hippie?icky
Harry potter, don?t you try nothing tricky
Muggles befuddled by my?wizardry
Pancake ?misery? of all any beat
I am instinctively syncing my energy
With the high heavens
Secretly developing a brand new pedigree, specialty, a better me
I essentially, must defeat what is left of me?the evil me
May you rest in pieces
Recently deceased, I believe that world peace is
Easily in reach if religion is decreased. Eh
G-G-G-Gs!
I don?t believe in Jesus
Does that mean that I am a DEMON?
Couldn?t God and Allah have the same meaning giving someone something to believe in?
Cuz these days, between the T-Vay and what I read, I don?t foresee a brand new way
Of living in the U-S of A
Do us a Fay-vor?I think we need to smoke some WAAYD!

Yes! Excuse me waiter, where are my capers?
(Forreal, I don?t wanna be a pain in the ass but I wanted capers on this salad YEA BOI!)
And we act (we act)
Like they know (like they know)
But it?s clear (it?s clear)
That they don?t (that they don?t)
So we bitch (yeah, we bitch)
And we moan (and we moan)
And won?t switch (and won?t switch)
Till we vote?and pick a new leader for the new year
YES WE CAN! Did you hear? That?s the new cheer
Twenty-twelve. Did you hear? That?s the new fear
So, oh well, roll a blunt, get a new beer
Ash be the truth?sorry yo, I?m new here
Did not introduce me
I am so rude-arrrrrogant shoes, hell yeah they be a new pair. (good grief)
Hell, oh well, tell me who cares
Who dares to play musical chairs with the fair-skinned Farrah Khan of hims?
I am sit-ting, sticking my ?one dick in? writtens
A Maryland terrapin, American lyricist with a pen, they call me a terrorist cuz I can embarrass the top ten. I guess I am Clark Kent. Ash Roth, uh, add me as a top friend
