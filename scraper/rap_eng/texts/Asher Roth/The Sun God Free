[Intro]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
That was my, my villain laugh

[Verse 1]
Yeah I don’t have it figured out yet
Matter fact I just figured out my outfit
Don't doubt that
Gotta clue what I'm doin'
But I'm sure not a shoe-in I can ruin it
By being untrue to it
Untrue to me, excuse my truancy
While sex sells and I excel in nudity
The influence of jewelery ain't cool to me
Search the globe for something
That’s more new to me
But buffoonery is usually my duty see
The fool in me is rooted deep and has
Me actin' foolishly
But the fruit in me is sweeter then the ghoul in me
So all only stupid me could ruin this here opportunity
So tune in and listen to my fluency
The way I do it, you would think there was 2 of me
More like 10 of me
I have a tendency as Edison invented with a pen and a sentence

[Interlude]
That's what I'm talking 'bout boy
And you know I'm gettin' filthier like each week I been down here
Every every verse has been getting more lethal

[Verse 2]
Not to mention my quick comprehension
That lead to success and tremendous progression
Self-expression is all that I know, my direction is all on my own
I direct it, produce and edit
So no excuse if I loose, can't regret it
But I won't let it get to ever be an incorrect
My skills are set to represent the flows to feel they haven’t been, uh

[Outro]
Aw man!
I stumbled on that last line
