[Verse 1]
When I wake up in the morning happy
I got a lot of people talking at me
As if in my shoes, they'd walk every mile, yeah
So I deal with negativity all day
But I am not going to let it rub me the wrong way
To each his own, and I walk away with a smile

[Chorus 1]
Because until I share my life with someone else
I'm a find my good times by myself
And you'll never see me sad about it, no

[Chorus 2]
Singing
Na na na I'm a be
Na na na I'm a be
Na na na I'm a be cool
Oh I'm a be alright
Na na na I'm a be
Na na na na I'm a be
Na na na I'm a be cool
Don't worry about me

Ooh ooh oh...

[Verse 2]
As you can see I'm not a stressed out person
I don't really think the time is worth it
I'd rather spend it with a girl and my guitar
(And it sounds something like...)
But I'm not really found a girl that gets me
But that don't mean I walk around feeling empty
It only means I got to be patient for a while
And that's alright

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

Ooh ooh oh

[Verse 3]
(I feel you Cody, we just chilling, we just chilling)
No brother it's nothing, I'm not bugging
I wake up in the morning and enjoy an English muffin
Little fried egg with a side of turkey bake
And I'm dancing around the kitchen listening to T-Pain
I understand things won't always go my way
Instead of trying to force it I just try and ride the wave
Go in, around, and up, and down, and never look away
Stay focused on that level ground and things will turn out straight
Yeah my intuition's fabulous, instincts are simply great
And my homies keep me grounded, never worried about the hate
If you hear them talking bad, then this is what you do
Look them in the face and say I'll be cool
Tell them Cody, brother

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Ooh ooh oh
(Don't worry about me, I'm a be cool)
