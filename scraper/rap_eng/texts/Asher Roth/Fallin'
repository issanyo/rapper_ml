[Verse 1]
Okay, yeah
I remember way back, I mean, way back, ages
8th grade I think, feels like yesterday
Bowl cuts was the craze, I was crazy
Long blonde hair all over the place
And I'm pale as I ever was, baby face
With a frame like a skeleton
Skinny kid, no, friends with bout everyone
No shit, I was cool, I had plenty fun
But one wish, I would grow up big
No, not built, but they say drink my milk
Didn't get nowhere, switched up diet
Started having hip-hop, pops didn't buy it
Wanted more Springsteen, Earth, Wind, Fire
Felt that was fine but to rhyme, had to try it
Couldn't hide the fact I wanted to rap
Bought Jay-Z's CD with my own cash, man
And that was back around '98
With the Annie sample and Money Ain't A Thang
And even though I really couldn't relate
I kept studying and listening and stuffing my face and now

[Hook]
I don't feel like I'm fallin' (Cause I'm so high that)
I don't feel like I'm fallin' (And I'm so fly that)
I don't feel like I'm fallin' (Cause I'm so high that)
I don't feel like I'm fallin'

[Verse 2]
Then came high school
Started picking up a mic, thought I was cool
My friends said homie you know that your white, dude
I said What? Fa real? Oh it's all good
Cause like this, when I tried it, liked it
Flipped it, hyped it, insisted the mic
Cause this shit's just right
Just like that, 9th grade footy heard
Straight from the Philly burbs, feel me? pretty sure
Suburban Threat was the name and we really were
Steady wasting the day spittin' silly verses
No curses, writing bout our girlfriends
Ballpoint pen, mines spinning like a whirlwind
Getting on the mic, I'm a wizard like merlin
Breaking barriers, tearing walls like it's berlin

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And I think it was the summer of 12th grade
When Uncle C passed away, leaving us empty
And it hurt real bad
Disturbed real sad
But we had to move on
So infact, real fast, we wrote this song
Bout fallen ones and miscues and misviews
Of the misuse of words used to diss dudes
So true, in a serious face
I'm convinced God works in mysterious ways
Like everything happens for a reason
I had to believe it cause that would explain why they leave us
As in people that mean everything
I got love for them all, they'll be there if I fall but

[Hook]
