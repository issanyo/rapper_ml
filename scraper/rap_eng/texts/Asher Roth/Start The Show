[Intro]
Yeah, what's up everybody?
My name's Asher Roth
And this is The Greenhouse Effect
I'll be your host this evening
I brought a couple friends
Some of them you might know
But, let's start the show

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
I got this thing, sort of like King's dream
A feeling of instinct
A vision that's in sync with everything
I think that
If I just rhyme, take one day at a time
Don't miss the blink of an eye, gotta stay positive
Isn't as common as your common sense (Listen to)
Ready to die under rhyme and sense
I should've been
More wise with the time I spend
If I could make up my mind I'd be dominant
But this rap thing is Russian Roulette
One bullet, don't pull it, don't do it
So stupid cause once you gone you won't come back
This is life, once chance to prove your ass
That's why I'm spending every second, every breath I get to rev it
If I live to make you never say that I was not a threat (Or lethal weapon)
Better yet, a menace with aggression
Pressin' that red button, every rep said I'm nothin'
Shit
Now let's start the show
A break from the old
I came here to go
To the top of the globe
Yeah, Ash 'bout to blow
In case you ain't know
I'm new on the set
Stay tuned for what's next
The Greenhouse Effect
You know
