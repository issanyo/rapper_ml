[Jesse Boykins III]
Can take it all from me
So I know you want to see
Can take it all from me
So I know you want to see
Can take it all from me
So I know you want to see
Can take it all from me
So I know you want to see

Those my shoes, that's my shirt
That's my house, that's my bitch
That's my food, those my clothes
That's my house, that's my whip

[Asher Roth]
Yo, we on one, feeling like we way above the law, son
Nicklebacks and headies got me feeling kind of awesome
Star sons, zodiac debilitated Mars but
Got the bars to bag it up that Asher Roth's a raw one
On the road to riches, I ain't make it very far cause
Seems that I desire more than calabasas cars
Caviar always tasting kind of blah to me (Honestly)
Keeping a facade kind of hard to me (Hard to be)
Anything you isn't actually that's kinda awkward
Student with a lisp and stutters spelling out a long word
Law firm, strong earn, got two degrees
But don't mean he got the means to kick rhythm on the beat
Eating breakfast on the beach with my tutti fruiti honey pie
She can be wherever, she ain't comfortable with other guys
The way I rub her feet underneath vanilla skies
Chocolate covered compliments can't help if she got better style
Let it slide, leather sandals on, stellar vibe
I can probably stunt it if I want it but I never try
That's just me, OG, old soul
King Cole since a year old I swear I been here before
Those past life's get bright late at night
Wouldn't trade a day of this life's fight to get right
Carlton on Fresh Prince once quipped he'd flip script
And for once chicks would dig him and then think he was legit
All you need is confidence, a little common sense
But sometimes to be the opposite, that's just how it is
All you need is confidence, a little common sense
But sometimes to be the opposite, that's just how it is
