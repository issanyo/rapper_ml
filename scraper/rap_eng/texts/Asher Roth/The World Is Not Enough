[Verse 1]
Thought I could save the world with the rhythm and rhyme
But then I came to find they had a prison in mind
Violence on the rise got us living in crime
They wanna lock us up, take your position in line
Well by God if this isn't a sign
And we have no idea what we've been visited by
Yeah, you bet it's real, we are mission-aligned
But they saying Ash chill man, this isn't the time
Well when is it?
Our people been evicted
From homes they grew up in but nobody cares to listen
Man it's pretty sick they try to vilify religions
And pit us against each other when nobody's really different
Capitalism, this is a growing issue
You with us or against us?
Pick which one is you
Won't be until this fucking revolution hits you
That they already out front, ready to come and get you

[Chorus]
This world, This world is never enough
Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what)
This world is never enough
Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what)
This world is never enough
Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what)
This world is never enough
Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what)

[Verse 2]
Am I the last one left?
Peace, love, and happiness
Or just another rapper mad I got a stupid ass to kiss
So I could get a buck while bloodsuckers live it up
Just give me some man, why's it gotta come to fisticuffs?
These drugs bad man, they snorting up bath salts
Heroin and crack-rock, what's in the bag dog!?
Stealing from my dad just to get us some cash
We face a tall task, dang, yo enough with the fast talk
Give it to me straight, there's so much I could take
While they multiply the problems and divide us by hate
And the radio, they playing only things that they pay
Man it's a shame cause the music was our only escape, so
Now we all alone and everybody's a clone
Cause everybody's always on their cellular phone
So now we getting slow and becoming a drone
We missing out on really living, I just want you to know

[Chorus]
This world, This world is never enough
Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what)
This world is never enough
Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what)
This world is never enough
Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what)
This world is never enough
Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what)
