Intro:
RYAN LESLIE ! *clap clap clap*
That was me at the listening session, causing the ruckus
Meanwhile, you wanted to rap with me, here it goes

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Shoot, you know when it comes
It's the only time you really wasn't looking for love
And then she shows up, looking so damn wonderful
And now you wonder what it's like if she was the one
But it's rule #1: Don't be jumping the gun
Gotta keep it unassuming, only do it for fun
And you don't know where she's been, and you don't know what she likes
But wouldn't mind finding out by the end of the night
So you holla with a smile and a innocent face
If she's with it, you can meet her for a dinner and blaze
Ain't no sinnister ways, I dont need to get laid
I'm just looking for some cooking from a beautiful face
Stop playing, yall arrange 3 day vacations
Get away to a place, obsolete location
Lowkey, no need for them tabloid pages
Just me, plus you, cut screw cassette
