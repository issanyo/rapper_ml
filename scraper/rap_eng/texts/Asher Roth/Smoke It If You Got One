[Chorus: Asher Roth] x2
All these bitches not my problem
I play them like this here guitar
And they say smoke it if you got one
Who would've known it'd been this hard
Cuz they not like you
No they not like you
Cuz they not like you
No they not like you

[Verse 1: King Chip]
I'm gunning for my nigga for the low
I'm gunning for my nigga for the low
Gotta get some backwoods from the store
Woods from the store
I'm always stressing out but you ain't never know
Imma try to keep that shit all on the low
I'm always stressing out but you ain't never know
One day I'm gonna blow
That plane ride from Cleveland was crazy
My nigga Hawk died right before I left
Niggas wait until I'm good and gone living on the west
Try to play me to the left
Imma start a whole new chapter of my life
Finna grind hard smoking on the best
I give my son a better life than I had
Imma show him how to play some real chess

[Chorus: Asher Roth]
All these bitches not my problem
I play them like this here guitar
And they say smoke it if you got one
Who would've known it'd been this hard
Cuz they not like you
No they not like you
Cuz they not like you
No they not like you

[Bridge: King Chip]
Smoke it if you got one
Smoke it if you got one
Smoke it if you got one
Smoke it if you got one
Smoke it if you got one
Smoke it if you got one
Smoke it if you got one
Smoke it if you got one

[Verse 2: King Chip]
I'm at the sports bar routing for the Browns
Repping Cleveland city while I'm floating through the town
They don't even gotta score a touchdown
Imma still hold it down
Still blow a Dawg Pound
You can't even understand that
Either you love it or you can't stand that
I ain't worried about the hoes or the money
I'm just enjoying the sun
Where I'm from ain't sunny

[Chorus: Asher Roth] x2
All these bitches not my problem
I play them like this here guitar
And they say smoke it if you got one
Who would've known it'd been this hard
Cuz they not like you
No they not like you
Cuz they not like you
No they not like you
