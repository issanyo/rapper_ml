[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Not as easy as it sounds or looks
It took books and books of read potions to cook this good
Those blokes who rely on hooks, they won't last
When they clash with the force of Truck North and Ash'

Rap's Eric Clapton
Ginger and Jack and
Newest to Philly, call me Jeremy Maclin

Travelin'
To the land of Anglo-Saxon
Comes back with a mustache and an accent
Excellent. In my passed past I'm an axeman
Chop down trees with the ease of a backhand
Stashing my weed in the jeans of a best friend
Baddest on beats if you ask 50 black men

Facin-
-Nating with the way I bring it back in
Patiently waiting for the day I bring it back when
Rap's been rated and degraded by our actions
Lackin', any real creative or some passion

That's when
Ash collapses the trapdoor
And happens to back them up, into a corner store
Let them go, or we call the coroner
Yo, I'm torn, it's up to Truck North

[Verse 2: Truck North]
Yeah, then I came through like a sweeper set
Burn after reading, don't let nobody see it
Skydive off a roof if you want the juice
The root of all evil bears the best damn fruit

So what will he do through the cheers and the jeers?
They shout like tears and fears in my ears
I'm singing songs from the big chair
They're like, "slow it down, Northside, you're flying over our heads"

That's when I told them 'speed up'
Then I turn the heat up
So burn in the hottest winter ever when I speak up

They say it's in the water
Dumb too young, got smart too old
Now it's all out of order

It's sorta like a borderline horror to your comedy
Kill 'em all one at a time like monogamy
Got a double meaning
It's all depending on how you see it
It's all in perspective

I study misdirection so I divert attention like illusionist
Houdini to the 'whodunits', who's new to this?
"Not I" said the cat
You're looking at a hardcore veteran
Better than you've ever been
Better than you'll ever be
The best rapper in the international vicinity
And locally, I've been a G

Stay chillin' with a Jasmine Guy type
Ice cold, what would you do for a Klondike?
North trying to get bus like Eric Murdock
Fresh to the coffin, the client won't spit out
Pass flowers for the style I empower
Your lady get wetter than a shower
When I call her

Yeah, I 'oughta
Y'all niggas dead wrong
Cause y'all been on that for way too long
I'm way too strong
And y'all so drawn
Like a stensil
If I offended you, I meant to

What to do, in the clutches of a cobra?
Command the dance until the climate gets colder
Hey Ash, where the stash at?
Trapdoor in the Lincoln, four score
And pass that
