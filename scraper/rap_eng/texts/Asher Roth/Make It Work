[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I said it's worth more mentally
When you can touch but keep the peace
Its simple, but deceptively
I feel  your warmth, I know your taste
I fell in love with your word
I know that you're worth it
I really love when it's earned
It seems like you want this
And when it's done to the dirt
Who could regret this?
I fell in love with your word
It seems like you're worth it

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good if it kills me
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good 'til tomorrow
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
(Uh huh, you know what I'm saying, so it's like...)
I'm learning to take it slow but I don't wanna though
Especially tonight you look phenomenal, simply astronomical
I had a moment where I zoned and thought of us alone
I had you moaning, yeah, I wanna jump your bones
But it takes more than a boner for us to make a happy home
But when I grow up big and strong, I sure don't wanna live alone
So fuck the phone, I cross the ocean in a boat
I have to row cause flowing's too slow
And both motors are broken
And the sky opens up and I don't have a raincoat
Cause I threw everything I own out for this hand-written note
That says "I wanna make it work", that might not even work
Cause do I really believe that two people on this Earth are meant to be?
Eventually, I guess we'll see but in the meantime let's roll this weed
Turn out free time to you and me time
Turn our free time to you and me time
Let's turn our free time to, you know

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good if it kills me
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good 'til tomorrow
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
It feel good don't it?
A little longer
I need you all night
And we a one now
And she's alone now
And I'mma get it right
A little longer
Until we get it right
Until we get it right
I wanna make it work
And make it good 'til you feel it
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good if it kills me
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good 'til tomorrow
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good
