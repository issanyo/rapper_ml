[Chorus]
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable
My raps, my raps
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable
Too advanced for y'all
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
I spark light with the pen
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
I think it's time I play the lotto
I'm feeling lucky sucker, oh well fuck it is my motto
Gotta bring the ruckus, smoking nuggets, sip moscato
With Roscoe Dash while I play his record on serato
Vado's prolly my favorite rapper since Bob Dole
Odd flow so I drive slow with my eyes closed
Stop stroll, nah yo I'd rather eat hot crow
Closed throat, gross bro don't forget to swallow
Hollow that's what they try to tell me that my rhymes is
So I found God, had to tell him what his Moms did
What is this some fucking sick joke
Like an anorexic chick putting on a strip show
No shit oh bitch go and let them nips show
Let me see a pole flip and then throw it back ho
Bend that back bone when I take it back home
Heard I made that ass fat, im a fucking rap pro let's go

[Chorus]
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable
My raps, my raps
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable
Too advanced for y'all
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
I spark light with the pen
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvey]
Man I came to bring the pain, Twelvey spitting flames
Live from the 212 with my A dollar gang
AP Audamar, running like a Viking back
Instagram with the flow
All the hoes be liking that, recite it back
Run it back, play it over, play it over
ASAP everything, my young nigga’s taking over
Pop Rex make your soda loud its a roll up
Cooking up some shit Ty Dash screaming hold up
Rosay what it do, trill niggas making moves
Came to give you hell, for the pleasure and the principal
Kicked outta school, school, trapping in the frat house
Gorgeous motherfucker getting pussy like a cat house
Blow her back out, didn’t bring the stacks out
Then she got a train, everybody in the stash house
Carolina blue jays, shit is like Stackhouse
Sipping real slow but a nigga on the fast route
Last year this time I was on some low shit
Last year this time y'all was on some ho shit
Body after body I'm a twelve gauge shotty
Toasted to the most high cause I know that God's got me

[Bridge]
Man I came to play
I ain’t talking bout no games today
Man I’m tripping on the fame today
Man I aim to spray, step back and let the flame away
I set it off, man I came to play
Man I’m tripping on the fame today
Man I aim to spray, step back and let the flame away
Yo I think I took to many of those
Yo Ash how many was I supposed to take, I think I'm fucked

[Verse 3: Chip Tha Ripper]
Walk in the most expensive strip club with my dick out
Pitched a fist full of change at the stripper and knocked that bitch out
Today was my first day at work I brought your dish out
Clip my toenails over your plate to watch you fish out
Pictures of greatness show me wear the cake is
I'mma take it and shove it all up in the lawmakers faces
Doing what you feel could be unreal
I looked up and spit like a half a mill
Pictures of my old crib hanging in my new crib
Raps and hoes besides those I don’t do shit
Trying to live extra cool, I don’t fuck with the stress
Louie condoms, bitch come get fucked with finesse
The school pimping the kids, they selling chocolate bars
Me and my niggas in this bitch and we some chocolate stars
You said I fell off, my money said that bitch a liar
How you sleeping on Chip when your mattress on fire
Tonight's the night that could change your life girl
All you gotta do is give him what he like girl
A lotta head, a lot of shut the fuck up and chill
Maybe a twenty-five some and two Viagra pills

[Chorus]
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable
My raps, my raps
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable
Too advanced for y'all
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
I spark light with the pen
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable

[Verse 4: YP]
Blunts rolled now flame up, I done came up
When you steady going up they wanna hang you
But I ain't worried until they read me a verdict
I promise I'ma splurge it cause I feel I deserved it
I get more from flipping than burgers
Move from a worker to the chairman of my own operation
You could get under, no wonder
I throw a party and bitches think it's a slumber
It's some chicks that spent the night, I never gave em my number
I'm young Hefner, couple cuties to measure
Hundred and twelve weigh it up, its nothing extra
And when you murdered the pen they wanna test you
Just dont make me black yo eyes like Uncle Fester
Don't you know I'm one of them guys go check the record
Have me get to clapping like the end of a lecture
I'm building an empire you part of this, you lucky
They call me YP but in my city I'm like Nucky
Ripley's couldn't believe it and haters feel the same
They dont know about the grand, think juices are Minute Maid
I tell them all the time, get out, get paid
Are you here for the long haul or only just a phase
