[Intro: Tiglo]
Ay, turn this up!
Ay, roll the windows down, too

Yeah, Yeah

[Hook: Tiglo]
Now, I could be a suit
Office with a view
Chick with a good resume, and no tattoos
But I’d rather just groove
Everybody just move

[Verse 1: Tiglo]
Yo, what you know about groove?
Your neighborhood is on the news
And I could buy my hood with all this shit I spent on school
That’s the cold truth
Still I floss and rock gold
Impressing girls with money that I got back from my loan
This is new game
Pop said back in the day, that
Nobody ever thought to rock two chains (True)
Generation change
The wheel's in my hands
I'll probably never get this feeling again
The moon lighting up what we dream to attain
The shit Mack said that was etched in his veins
So I can meet a chick that'll think I’m the shit
And ignore that I hit other chicks, no regret
And then tell her friends that she got with the kid
That tend to rock shows and got gold on his wrist
Shit, hate how that process goes
I never really liked to call my old girls those
I’m only human
Plus I’m living through my music
I see problems every day
So I gotta get my groove in
Shit, you know I gotta get my groove in, uh-huh
So go on and let me get my groove in

[Hook: Cole]
Now, I could be a suit
Office with a view
Chick with a good resume, and no tattoos
But I’d rather just groove
Everybody just move
Oh baby, you, you got what I need
And you might be cute
But you’re not no freak
And baby girl, I need that

[Verse 2: Cole]
A ride or die girl that always know just where the weed at
See, that’s my dream (Yeah, that's my dream)
And you know my crew (Yeah, you know my crew)
Living like James Dean
Cause we playing out this movie 'til the very last scene
We living so fast that we just crashed
And I perish in my parents’ minivan, back seat, uh
Rollin', we ain’t slept in like a week, nah
Growing up, a rebel without a cause
I was on the bus, a rebel without a car
Got in trouble with the law out of lust
First time I went and got up in them draws
You can trust, parents stressed
The tailor lost innocence when your mama walked in on us
With your tail up and your hair a mess
(Ahh shit!)
But that was our groove
When your mama coming back?
Cause we in the living room
I don’t wanna see my answer, all these tattoos

[Bridge: Tiglo & Cole]
Oh baby, you, you got what I need
But if you wanna roll
You got to believe
You don’t really know what you got 'til you old
You hung up on the past
You got to let go
Some shit up in your life is out of control
So groove one time
Just let yourself go
Groove one time
Just let yourself go

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
No wonder the world's about to be pulled under
Hole, sucking the soul, gutted our own mother
Gold hunt in the cold
Got us some cold water
Want no part of the show, saw it, it’s old product
Oh, brother, this mode would make Joe stutter
No d-d-d-dead, goes the slow shutter
No, none of that, though
We on a whole 'nother globe runner
Coming with my brothers from another, so
You can miss me with that pessimisticness
You insist we in the system
But that system don’t exist
Yeah, sissy need assistance when he piss and when he shh
We ain’t listening
We busy chasing chicks and making hits
'Bout the dollars, need a neurologist
I suggest you go and kick it with them loving college kids
Where life is innocent
Enough with all that villain shit
We just wanna groove
Turn it off if we ain’t feeling it, uh
Ash Roth always killing it
Rhyming I be kinda raw, dog
The children spit
Yeah, just a big kid how I’m living
Don’t worry about a thing
I’m just chillin'
Cause I could be a suit
Pocket full of loot
Chick got a fat ass, but a bad attitude
And I’d rather just groove
Yeah, I’d rather just groove

[Outro]
Now, I could be a suit
Office with a view
Chick with a good resume and no tattoos
But I’d rather just groove
Everybody just move
