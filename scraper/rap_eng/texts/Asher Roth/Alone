Uh. know what I mean
We all, we all got our own thing
And heres mine..

[Verse: 1]
Now ma' things was cool
I swore id never break the rules
Straight with you cause I could relate to you
Stay with you
Special in my book
In my point of view he couldn't sex you like I could
You got with you wanted
And flaunted what you wanted
And I went a little further even when you didn't want it
Cause right in time, right what I had in mind
Plus your heads been right in mine (my mind)
So I took the time, my choice was to love you
And I didn't listen when they said never should I trust you
So why must you take me for granted
I swore you loved me too, damn ill never understand it
I'm a man with feeling to and I'm a fool for the way I still feel for you
But heres to you, I'm a better man then that
You took my heart then and now I want it back
So come on

[Hook]
Told me you and I might live together someday(someday)
Now I see it in a whole new other way
And ain't gonna lie girl you need to realize
I'm staying home tonight (so come on)
Said I wanna be alone (said I wanna be alone)
All by myself
Said I'm staying home, I don't need no one else (wanna be alone)

[Verse: 2]
I was cool, gave you one more chance
You gave the same old song, same old dance
So hell with it, I had to face that shit
You was to immature for relationships
So I moved on for the time being
Then I heard a lie, theres a guy that you were caught seeing
I flipped shits, but you flipped shits right back
You cried you knew I wouldn't do you like that
Still my heart was lonely, nobody to hold me
You was my only, damn girl you was my homie
You know me, you said you were stuck back there
So when I tried you leave you sucked me right back in
Why would I taste what I already ate?
So I took time to get my priorities straight
So listen you know me well I hate to doubt you
But girl truth is I'm better off with out you and

[Hook]

[Verse: 3]
Damn girl I thought it never would end
But this is it thats all, never again
I couldn't deal with it then and I sure can't now
So what makes you think I'mma let you hold me down, no
I told you before never to roam but this is real when I say leave me alone
I gotta be on my own, and you do too
Through and through just please let me do what I do
Maybe sometime soon we can both be friends,
But for now this is where its suppose to end
My brain is sick, my heart is torn, my arms are empty
But baby girl I just need to be alone
My heart will beat alone, and I keep my head up
But truth is now I'm a little bit fed up
I don't hate you though, you still close to me
So lets just go back to how we used to be, cool..

[Hook]
Told me you and I might live together someday(someday)
Now I see it in a whole new other way
And ain't gonna lie girl you need to realize
I'm staying home tonight (so come on)
Said I wanna be alone (said I wanna be alone)
All by myself (no no no no no)
Said I'm staying home, I don't need no one (wanna be alone)
I don't wanna be here in this chair
Waiting on you aw baby, to see things my way
Why don't you see things my way
(woahhhhhh)
Told me you and I might live together someday(someday)
Now I see it in a whole new other way
And ain't gonna lie girl you need to realize
I'm staying home tonight (so come on)
Said I wanna be alone (no no no no no)
All by myself
Said I'm staying home(said I'm staying home)
I don't need no one (wanna be alone)
I'm so gone
