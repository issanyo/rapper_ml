[Verse]
Y'all learned the hard way, sometimes you crawl too far
But you ain't climbed this high to fall
Scared of heights bright lights, shine in the dark
It's no walk in the park, more like salsa dancing in New York
Can't be taught all raw talent, my talents, all valid, organics, my salad
I'm authentic, I'm off my neck
Yeah I think I must have lost my head by keep rolling
I'm waste deep in the quicksand, this is where it kicks in
Killer instincts, they grip in
No kickstand ride it, ride it
And this is it man, ride or dying
I'm taking it too easy not warm yet
Don't wanna pull nothing let's not force it now
Cause close only counts in horseshoes pal
If I'mma do it, I'mma do it all sorts of wow
Rhyme with you, I'mma ruin all sorts of doubt
She with you then I'mma do in, just toss the towel
Run in to it my intuitive is awesome, wow
Super duper how he do it he's a foster child?
Hardly, raised in, Yardley, this rap thing's a phase it's mainly a hobby
But oddly enough, stayed with it, I'll be
Gosh darn it what his name isn't who is he â€” Asher!
Last chance here's a free pass man
Go now we can put it in the past tense
Or you can stay and get your ass kicked
Mop the floor with you, put you in the trash can
No laughing I'm actually passive but Ash is just nasty when naturally rapping
Too fast I don't think you can grasp it
And that's it, Cannon show 'em where the scratch is
