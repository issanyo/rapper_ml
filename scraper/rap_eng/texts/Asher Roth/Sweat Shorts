[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
I'm a cool kidded, loose fitted, jewels spitting bad rapper
Half-ass the past six years, flipping swag jacker
Wish I had a leather jacket, band tee, clear pants
Stupid ass hat, pass me another beer man
Cheers fam, wearing anything I feel I really want
Like my name is Frankenstein, now I'm Adam Sandler's son
I'm like Chandler from Friends with a man bun
That hid his handguns in his mini Cooper Anderson
[?] son painted [?] land from
Space Jam slam, hope you caught that on your camera
Don't understand me, think I might move up to Canada
Root for Vancouver, Shareef Abdur medula oblongata
If you got a problem holler
Wrote a novel on my motto, only suckers spit to swallow shucks
What do I know, I'll just let this be the motto
But because the guac is hot don't mean I'll be an avocado

[Hook: Asher Roth & (Chuck Inglish)]
Like a Martin Scorsese or a Spike Lee flick
(I keep the same motherfuckers up on my shit)
Like the SportsCenter anchors on that TV script
(You talking game but you always same old shit)
Like a Martin Scorsese or a Spike Lee flick
(I keep the same motherfuckers up on my shit)
Like the SportsCenter anchors on that TV script
(You talking game but you always same old shit)
Balling is my best short
Hand on my balls while I'm in my sweat shorts
Balling is my best short
Hand on my balls while I'm in my sweat shorts

[Verse 2: Chuck Inglish]
On my front porch in my sweat shorts
Reading the old Source you know, the low sport
On the block crossover on the ball court
Free throw, shoot your shot bro, it's all yours
I'm bout to get it all back like a bra strap
All that, fall back like a fade away
808 made a way, MJG playa way
That Slick Rick, Dana Dane, Doug E Fresh, Daddy Kane
Keep it player (I ain't playing) but I got a game today
Receive a bonus from the owners, I'm about to call the play
The running backs run it back
But the corners get the sacks
The quarterbacks talking fast, watch the marching band dance
Flambe the souflet, I butterflied the lobster
So much game I'm on the field with Bob Costa, John Madden
Sagging in my shorts with a four course meal pockets dragging on the floor

[Hook: Asher Roth & (Chuck Inglish)]
Like a Martin Scorsese or a Spike Lee flick
(I keep the same motherfuckers up on my shit)
Like the SportsCenter anchors on that TV script
(You talking game but you always same old shit)
Like a Martin Scorsese or a Spike Lee flick
(I keep the same motherfuckers up on my shit)
Like the SportsCenter anchors on that TV script
(You talking game but you always same old shit)
Balling is my best short
Hand on my balls while I'm in my sweat shorts
Balling is my best short
Hand on my balls while I'm in my sweat shorts

[Verse 3: Helios Hussain]
Too many niggas in the world but not enough ideas
I'ma call you a bitch while you out with your kids
Little Jonathon, your daddy is a rap style copycat
I'ma move in and be your daddy, he's a follower
I'm your role model but I gotta fuck your momma
You gon' have a brother, he gon' make you way tougher
Uncle Ash is black, he just put rims on a pickup truck
Burglarizing styles I'ma tell my big brother Chuck
Ball on bitch niggas who been stealing our intentions
Make 'em do our homework and send 'em to detention
Never steal a man's style when you grow up, remember
Cause we gon' find out and whoop your ass while we drunk
Iâ€™m Bonafide with my writing rhymes, Street Volume 2
Not in my house, my Vokals like the Lunatics
What the hook gon' be, I'ma bring it like I'm Murphy Lee
Air Force Ones sweat shorts sagging comfortably
