Kids these days, kids these days
Kids these days, kids these days
Jeez kids these days
Yo might be the most slept on in the world
Saying all this cool shit, just to be ignored
Like word white boy, what ever dude
Forget it, I hope you learned your lesson
No one pays you no attention
No longer feeling questions, go cancel all my sessions
I'm giving up fuck it, they all got the wrong impression
Bench players getting' all the minute since I left them
Shooting every second but can never hit the net
Mann these listeners be missing the original
Mr. invincible, knows no like I'm mystical
Hit the bowl hit the roll, and headed out to rip the show
Make them flip the lid explode of those who didn't know (boom)
And trespassing on ashes grass maggot, I'm a cracker, rap black
Lenny Kravitz, yeah, I'm passionate when it comes to this rap shit
So I can't stand when rappers kick whack shit
Like that kid better off chewing cactus
Going to run laps on me, going home and practice
Ashe don't be mad that you took a leave of absence
And since your last track all these other kids have cashed in
Well now I'm back, thanks for keeping my seat warm
Rapping don't be workin' out, go and join the Peace Corps
He swore don't give a fuck about your weed boy
Tell me how it feels to be another decoy, rejoice
Yea the heats back up in it, house done renn, time to pack up tenants
Yea the heats back up in it, house done renn, time to pack up tenants
Blue tenants
Jeez kids these days, Jeez kids these days
Jeez kids these days, Jeez kids these days
