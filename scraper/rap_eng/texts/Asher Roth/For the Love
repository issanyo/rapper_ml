[Verse 1: Chuck]
High class, if the stock crash
Got gold bars in the book bag
Small jabs, makin' large stacks
Two-stepping how Stella got her groove back
The crew's wrapped, this is how we do raps
This is breaking news. What you doing? How you do that?
Who asked you to do that?
(Get off yo phone when you on the dance floor!)
This ain't preschool, I don't do it for my health
It's in the bank, it's accumulating wealth
I feel great, it looks great
We 'bout to order up the lox plate
Fresh-squeezed everything
Got there, hit the store, copped everything
Olympic trial nigga gold medal everything
Feeling like I can do anything

[Hook x2: Chuck]
This is all that we want
Not much, give it all, give it up
If it ain't all for the love
This is all that we love

[Verse 2: Asher]
Ay yo my cake taste great
Let me eat when I wake and I bake
Head straight, I'mma make it
Got my name carved in the tree
Work hard dog, art star all in a day
We gon' ball, get paid
Get caught in the dark, or lost in thoughts from eighth grade
When I first heard curse words, new bro slang
Rirruto. Who doe? New ballgame
Gimme the loot, it's a too dope thang
Kudos, you know, choose yo, lane
Numero uno, use yo krang
Don't be so amazed when they use yo name
While y'all sittin' talkin' 'bout who's kang
You should be ashamed, what are you saying?
This is life when we write it and recite
We the titans of the tight, being the brightest of the light (c'mon...uh)

[Hook x2]
