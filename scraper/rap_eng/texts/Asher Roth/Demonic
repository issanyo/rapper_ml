I see you, the hottest thing up on the floor
The way she moves:
Got me wanting more
Drink in my hand
DJ play my song
Got me feelin good, I'm about to get it on
I can't explain, I'm in the mood
The way you do the things you do
She got the look, she got the moves, she got it: Ooh, she demonic

On the dance floor she transforms
The way that she moves put a trance on you
"Ooh, can I put my hands on you, there's not much that I won't do
It's no secret I want you, girl, you're my matcha, girl, Sriracha, girl
I'm at your mercy, girl, don't hurt me, girl
Got a bad case of a devil worshiper...."

Nah nah nah hold up hold up hold up
I'm on my way in rap, ain't no girl getting in the way of that
I want my name on plaques. On stage I'm phased im a dangerous actor
How strange is that? Little Ash blew up, got famous faster
But fame is wack, I came here to change it, take it back
Cause the way we act and the way we rap
Yeah, its maniac, satanic practically
We want change then changed we have to be
You see me I speak proactively and back it up with the things I do
Everything we do we should think it through
Yeah, I seek the truth then I seek the booth
Yeah, I deep my roots to speak to you
Yeah, the scenic route I take for inspiration
Converse with nature, relay information
It's different it's intimidation
But it's new ways we are integrating
This is it; this be the disc: good for the soul, safe for the kids
A to the S, H to the E, R you ready for the greenhouse effect?
