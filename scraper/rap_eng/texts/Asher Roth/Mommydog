[Intro]
Fly alone, fly alone, far away
Fly alone, fly alone, far away

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
I appreciate your perspective, especially cause you get it
Essentially it feels destined, no questions or second guessing
But my impression is kinda like Kevin left by his parents
Forgetting left him alone at the home protecting it and
He ain't know it but he was growing
Confessing that
Even though ain't perfected
It’s golden, hold it it’s precious
And now were older
Thread has decided to reconnect us
I ain't never headed out without feathers made outta heaven
I won’t...

Fly alone, fly alone, far away
Fly alone, fly alone, far away

[Hook: C.J Smith]
I have been away for so long
I just wanna come home
Miss my mom and my dog
I'm on my way
I, I, I been away for so, been away for so long
I just wanna come home
I'm on my way

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
There's something to be cherished about the familiarity
Parents and family, helping hands that have taken care of me
Barely would've made it without those relationships
I wouldn't trade for riches or the other things they say you should
But it's true, it'd be cool if I had a pool in the backyard
Hundred-acre home with a fast car
Facts are, I don't care for it if they ain't there for it
Need the perfect people in my life for me to share it with

Fly alone, fly alone, far away
Fly alone, fly alone, far away

[Hook: C.J Smith]
I have been away for so long
I just wanna come home
Miss my mom and my dog
I'm on my way
I, I, I been away for so, been away for so long
I just wanna come home
I'm on my way

Fly alone, fly alone
Fly alone, fly alone, fly away
