[Hook x2]
I want your girl scout cookies
Gimme them, gimme them, gimme them
Gimme them, gimme them, gimme them
Gimme them, gimme them
Go girl, go girl scout x4
Go girl, go go

[Verse 1]
Lil' thin mint, thin miss, thin this
Thin hips, thick tits, yes yes yes yes
I wanna lick where the wind miss
Hit, miss, hit list
Hey kid, sit this one out
Got a number from one to ten
How many friends you should bring to this thing
With my thing, and we sing
And we drink, and I wink, and I think
That we got a little bottle we should spin
Let it sink in
The spell never ends at twelve
Sorry Cinderella, tell your man, oh well
We can do a dinner over at the inn, won't tell
I highly recommend we at the inn hotel
Oh hell no, kid I won't sell
I just meet 'em on the internet and hope it goes well
Blow Ls and a little Nutella
Come milk me like Samoa

[Verse 2]
Boom biggity boom da bomb biggy
The long lingerie tong thing sure is stringy
Why don't you take it off, you know we won't need it
Rock the boat though, she float like Aaliyah
No kidding, no, but no really
The shit that I spit from my dick is so sticky
No biggy though, I know a trick
If you go like this, it'll make it go quick
So, hocus pocus, focus, focus
Throw the throat it though, stroke it, stroke it
Slow poke, it go like eatin' okie
Oke a dokey artichoke, (???) open
Go slow though, never love a ho
Never know (?????)
