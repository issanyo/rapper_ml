[Intro]
Girls, girls, girls
Rub-rub on your titties
Girls, girls, girls
Rub-rub on your titties

[Verse 1]
I'm in the strip club staring at some tatas
Oooh yeah, I want that, give me, give me mama
Oh yeah, that's right, put it in my face girl
Where's all the breast milk? Let me get a taste girl (Mmmmm)
It's an interest, more like a fetish
To see big breast-es, bigger then my head is (Wow!)
I'm interested enough to get arrested
Federer effect, yeah, I'm up for some tennis
Back-forth, cross-court when she on all fours
Backhand in the full, sure to get a hand full (Gimme)
I hair pull, make sure I'm careful
Won't pull too hard, make it more bearable
Truth and dare, I dare you to take your shirt off
Over your shoulders it'll knock the dirt off
Thought I quit, are you kidding? Not a bit
Baby, stiffen up your lips, I'm a sucker for them tits, baby

[Chorus]
There's something 'bout a thick chick (Girls)
That makes me want to flip shit (Girls)
I got something to admit, it's (Girls)
I really like it when you (rub-rub on your titties)
There's something 'bout a thick chick (Girls)
That makes me want to flip shit (Girls)
I got something to admit, it's (Girls)
I really like it when you (rub-rub on your titties)
(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Look girl, when I grab it (grab it)
I got a tact tactic (tactic)
And if I could have mad tit (mad tit)
I'd have it like Brad Pitt (That's true)
Cause Angelina's got great tatas and Jen Aniston - woah! (Woah)
Pamela's got fake tatas and Anna Nicole
But anyway, I don't hate tatas, natural, silicone
It's all good, no fake tatas, I love those that are shown (Show 'em to me)
So, either way if it's A tatas (AA's), or size 44D (Big tits)
Can you put em in my face, mama, and rub on them for me?

[Chorus]
There's something 'bout a thick chick (Girls)
That makes me want to flip shit (Girls)
I got something to admit, it's (Girls)
I really like it when you (rub-rub on your titties)
There's something 'bout a thick chick (Girls)
That makes me want to flip shit (Girls)
I got something to admit, it's (Girls)
I really like it when you (rub-rub on your titties)
(Yeah)

[Verse 3]
I'm not a pig-headed chauvinist male, pathetic
Just a big-headed, slinging dick, pale sex addict
If a chick shows her tits, can I get a breast grab? (Please)
If she lets me go ahead, can I get the rest of that? (Come on)
Yeah, my male hormones are full-blown, can you blame me? (No)
So what if you know, ho? You can still lay me, uh
Not a thing, just a one-night bed fight
Get whips, get chains, I'm like "That's right!"
"Who's the boss?" is what I used to thought
Yeah, what I used to think, saying anything just to get it in
Suddenly it's setting in, I'm getting it, it's evident
Women are affectionate, need more then attention
When you loving them, them they loving it
Kisses and the hugs
When you rubbing them the right way, just keep rubbing it
Yeah, I'm cumming, can I cum all on your stomanich?
Right up on them titties, you can rub it in

[Chorus]
There's something 'bout a thick chick (Girls)
That makes me want to flip shit (Girls)
I got something to admit, it's (Girls)
I really like it when you (rub-rub on your titties)
There's something 'bout a thick chick (Girls)
That makes me want to flip shit (Girls)
I got something to admit, it's (Girls)
I really like it when you (rub-rub on your titties)
(Yeah)
