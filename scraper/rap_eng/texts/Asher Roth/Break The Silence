[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
And see I never thought it'd happen to us
Not another family as happy as us, its a matter of love
Just a little different, a little twisted
A bit sick, but sick is realistic
It isn't fiction, its the hidden truth
Some would rather act stupid than admit it's true
Just because it doesn't happen to you
Doesn't mean it doesn't happen
It happened to exclude you
I excuse you if you'd rather not
But someone you that know might be on the topic
On the hot seat
It's not easy to keep a secret and I can't keep this
It's too deep, real deep

[Hook: Big Prime Da General]
Deep secrets can't tell a friend
But it hurt so I can't hold it in
Hairy thoughts been sitting on the conscience
Its up to me to break the silence, the silence
The silence, break the silence
The silence, the silence
Break the silence, the silence
Silence, break the silence
The silence
Its up to me to break the silence, the silence

[Verse 2: Big Prime Da General]
Aye everybody gotta life story or situation
That they going through
So let me tell you what I'm facin'
My back against the wall
The hand I was dealt
Sorta like I'm playing spades
But not having a spade at all
Gimme one time to stand, one chance
One try and ill have you feeling my life
To the point where you cry
The separation of my parents
Left me embarrassed in school
Cause my dad was never there
Mom just act a fool
I think growing up in public housing
With my grandma it kept me grounded
Now I ain't high as mountains
Yea, now my goal is to keep you educated
Know my life
So you can tell
In every rhyme, that I'm dedicated

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
She was 13 and he was 32
And she could leave man if people only knew
B-but as a teen what hell you supposed to do?
Molested by her dad who was molested too
So confused she ran from and hided
Stashed away like it was a secret dialing
She cried at night
No one to confide it
Scared her mother wouldn't love her
If she finds it, so she lies
Kept it bottled up inside and
Mama came sick with the blindness
And in her mind everything was quite fine
'til he decided to break the silence

[Hook]
