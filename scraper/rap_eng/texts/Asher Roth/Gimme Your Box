[Asher:]
More often or not I won't fuck a box if I don't really know it's history
Don't wanna be shocked cause a million cocks got all up in that in between
But tonight to me, you're a mystery
So the history, don't mean shit to me
Yeah that new vajay could be squeaky clean or all beat up like...
More often or not I won't fuck a box if I don't really know it's history
Don't wanna be shocked cause a million cocks got all up in that in between
But tonight to me, you're a mystery
So the history, don't mean shit to me
Yeah that new vajay could be squeaky clean or all beat up like Britney's

[BOYDER!:]
Hi yo, yo what up Brit?
High five for the nipple stiff
Do you mind if I sit for this shit, I tip so big, you dig?
I dig, touch hers, at least right now I don't need numbers
Skiddydoop, rock paper skinny jahn
No chair, my face she be sitting on

[Chorus:]
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme your box

[Asher:]
I'm a menace with a pen and when I vent I put an end to all and everything they ever said about me
Like how I'm far too inner centre; how I sound like Eminem but then again I really don't, don't doubt me
Recommend me to a friend or download on the internet
I am the best, at least impressive how about it?
Not a minute left the spend, I wanna take you back and bend you over if you don't get it slow it down

[Chorus:]
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme your box
[x8]
