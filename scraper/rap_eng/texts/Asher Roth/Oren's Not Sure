[Intro]
Yeah yo
My tenth rap song of all time
Yeah

[Verse]
Horse manure, rode the first De Tour in coarse velour or Couture
Ask Oren but he wasn't sure (Yeah, I'm not sure)
Hoarser than a different person that I was before
I feel encouraged, more importantly I'm more mature
My endurance has been flourishing, I'm more secure
I'm either bored or I'm ignoring your moral support
Playing Chingy "Right Thurr" at a march for cures
Curing cancer with the artificial [?]
Interior be decorating cause I bought the flora
Breakdancing figure eights in a new fedora
Can't pretend to be this great, I got an extra ora
I got a extra hold up, you got the next one bruh bruh
My pen is flexing, signing checks like I'm a Xmas order
If I had sex with Storma in my extra dorma
The art award, you're more a martyr dog, [?]
Or departed, hit harder, you're a charlie horse
Ride a Harley, pork chopper darkest war
Park it in the back, let's get you started on a hearty porridge

[Outro]
I asked Oren but he wasn't sure
(Yeah, I'm not sure about that)
