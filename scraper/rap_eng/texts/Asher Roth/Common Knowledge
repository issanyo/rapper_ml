[Verse 1]
They say that if it works, don't fix it
Go against the law, might get a bit risky
No offense to y'all, but I feel a bit gifted
So I think my odds are about 50/50, crispy
O.K. Corral, we about to put it down
Take 10 and turn around, go and pull your pistols out
But what is this about, all these grenades and handguns
Magnús Ver Magnússon, strong set of hands, son
Tall, dark, handsome, holding y'all for ransom
Strong arm Lance so scared that he can't run
Cause when a man comes face to face with his fears
He gets weird, he can't hear, he can't see things clear
I be sincere, yes dear, guests here
Press gear, dress queers, fresh in my neck beard
Next year, net year, jet Leer, get near
Top tier, drop tears, no way not here
Cause there's no crying in baseball, and that's that
"There'll always be a case called when Ash rap
Bars will take your face off, no cat scratch
Go ahead, ask Wreck racks on racks, yea that
For a pat on the back after I black
Tackle and straddle a calf without impactin my breath
Climb the ladder of success, skipping and missing a step
New edition of spittin', you should've listened to Flex, it's like

[Chorus]
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know, oh, no
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know, oh, no

[Verse 2]
Slick Dickies, no one can stick with me
Spit it out quick, as soon as the shit hits me
Kill swiftly, been ill since Stick Stickley
Double dip dibs, I dibble and bust quickies
Nifty little shit, I do it while dressed thrifty
Pricks just stiff, my stick is so shifty, sick
Fred McGriff with the hits coming lefty
Used to be for free, now the seats never empty
It's elementary, yeah I heard it in assembly
Principal was telling me I'd better go ahead and read
Never be a better me, better off dead or me
Not really a better, but I’m betting that I’ll better be
Better with the rhetoric, set it up and let it rip
Aw better forget it man, kid's a fucking lunatic
Looney Toon, lunar eclipse
Every blue moon, might see a few shooting strips

[Chorus]
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know, oh, no
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know, oh, no
