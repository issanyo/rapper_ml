[Intro]
Oh my god yeah, oh yeah, oh my god yeah
This is awesome, so awesome, Cannon

[Asher Roth]
They know me this, yo I spit like a little kid
Rap thinks I’m a dirty hippie, icky
Harry Potter, don’t you try nothing tricky
Muggles befuddled by my wizardry
Pancake misery of all any beat
I am instinctively syncing my energy with the high heavens
Secretly developing a brand new pedigree, specialty, a better me
I essentially must defeat what is left of me
The evil me, may you rest in pieces
Recently deceased, I believe that world peace is easily in reach
If religion is decreased, eh geez
I don’t believe in Jesus, does that mean that I am a demon?
Couldn’t God and Allah have the same meaning?
Giving someone something to believe in?
Cause these days between the TV and what I read
I don’t foresee a brand new way of living in the U-S of A
Do us a favor, I think we need to smoke some weed
Yes, excuse me waiter, where are my capers?
For real, I don't wanna be a pain in the ass
But I wanted some capers on this salad, yeah boy
And we act like they know but it’s clear that they don’t
So we bitch and we moan it won’t switch till we vote
And pick a new leader for the new year
Yes we can, did you hear? That’s the new cheer
2012, did you hear? That’s the new fear
So oh well, roll a blunt, get a new beer
Ash be the truth, sorry yo, I’m new here
Did not introduce me, I am so rude
Arrogant shoes, hell yeah, they be a new pair
Hell oh well, tell me who cares
Who dares to play musical chairs with the fair-skinned Farrah Khan of hims?
I am sitting, sticking my one dick in writtens
A Maryland terrapin, American lyricist with a pen
They call me a terrorist cause I can embarrass the top ten
I guess I am Clark Kent, Ash Roth uh, add me as a top friend
