Man I don’t get what all the hype’s about
We used to only wanna know who was the nicest out
And you were dope if you can flow and didn't write it down
But now the blow up it’s like whoa, that doesn't count
Come on now, it’s all about power and money, yeah, the money and bitches
But the bitches ain't shit, they just sixes with titties
I mean really, I be wishing that it wasn't so true
Cause I've been in it for a minute feeling long overdue
Eating tiramisu, got a tailor masseuse
And apparel so rare, never wearing 'em two
Man I can barely move in these embarrassing shoes
And when I’m staying at the Sheraton I'm sharing a room
Like damn, this isn't fair yo, this thing got me fooled
Thought I’d live up on a mountain with a fabulous view
Sip the fountain of youth, be surrounded by boobs
Smoke the finest of the chronic, eat the wildest foods
But they stab me like I’m Judas in the back with a tool
But this is nothing like the movies of the television tube
It’s hard work, this art first, and archer
Get sharp first and then starts departure
Our heart hurts when bars start to falter
And hawk worth it’s far less, the marker
We all do it, we can be lazy and stupid
Like we gotta keep it cool ain’t nothing trying nothing new
But I’ll say, screw it, it’s only people and music
We just do what feels good and giving everything to it
Cause I’m fresh as the father sparrow, finer than Farrah Fawcett
The line of walk is kinda dark but I’m not scared of darkness
Nah, nah, nah I ain't scared of darkness
The line of walk is kinda dark but I’m not scared of darkness
Fresh as the father sparrow, finer than Farrah Fawcett
The line of walk is kinda dark but I’m not scared of darkness
Nah, nah, nah I ain't scared of darkness
Nah, nah, nah I ain't scared of darkness
Darkness, darkness
