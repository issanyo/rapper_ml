[Intro]
Thats what my body's telling me
In the morning, my hormones are just everywhere
In the A.M. I like to call it morning do, it's morning do

(Don Cannon)
Let's go

[Verse 1]
In the ante meridian, girl I be giddy, no shit, my dick be, hard as a brick
Girl I ain't kiddin', I really be feelin' it, might just stick it, between your legs
I like my eggs, sunny side up
I like my ass, sun is risin'
On top real fast she be ridin'
Burn da house down like I'm Andre Rison

Hell yeah, I suck on titties
Wrap my arms round plushy or skinny
Come on baby, lets get busy
You know how many, want to hit me?
There's so many, good and plenty
Chew them up and eat them every morning
It's my favorite to have sex morning do

[Hook]
I like to walk around naked (naked)
While my girl cook breakfast (breakfast)
She's making eggs and bacon (bacon)
I got the recipe, it's you on me and me on you
Its 8 a.m. with no clothes on, you so damn cute (so damn cute)
I kiss your neck and rub your thighs and feed you fruit (feed you fruit)
We sexin' in the morning
It's morning do (morning do)
It's morning do

[Verse 2]
I'm layin' in bed
Dreaming bout box
That's when I start to feel
A hand on my cock
She whispers in my ear
"ash I'm still hot
I know it's kinda early, can I climb on top?"
YEAH (hell yeah)
I would like that a lot
Let's try a new position, let's hit the g spot
She groanin' and she moanin' and screamin'
Dont stop!
She leans and tries to kiss me, I say
"chill, your breath's hot"
So kissin's out the question, but you know that hands hot
Her tongue can tie a stem into an overhand knot
I overhand slap
That booty
Watch it wiggle
Watch it jiggle
Watch she stop what she doin' just to giggle
Blow the whistle, (whistle blows) end of regulation
Overtime starts after eggs and bacon
Yeah

[Hook]
