Should we break our bread? Should we break our bread, we should break bread
We should break our bread, should we break our bread, we should break our bread

Where shall I begin? Let's chop it a little bit about these people called friends
The ones you can lean on and your life depends
On, watch who you call up cause that all depends, homes, it's quite a few different breed of them
But the right ones, to break bread with too damn slim
And those ones are so sincere to see you get it unlike some
Who hate to see that talented dude with it
Mad, cause they pockets ain't kilo enough, like a fat boy neck in a barber chair with a shape up
And Beijing with a Cesar such a back stabber thou shall shit on you, like two chicks in a cup
I know it sounds fucked up, but that's how life goes
Never know in who to trust but that's why life blows
So just take it as you go

We should break our bread, should we break your bread? We should break bread
We should break our bread, should break our bread, we should break bread

I look around like I don’t know these motherfuckers
It’s just because I got a couple bucks and now I'm stunting
And they wanna hang around eat some lunch, have some fun, smoking blunts, getting drunk
Guess I’m just another sucker, huh
All of a sudden bubble butts they wanna fuck
Cause if I'm coming quick enough then one of them is getting lucky
Cause she'll have my son and then take it all from me
Leaving nothing but the crumbs and a little alimony
When all you homies wanna do is hit the club
Popping bottles, live it up, but you’re paying for the bub
I mean it bruh, they seem like they’re so nice, they’re the ones who prey on you
And wait till you’re just right
But Goldylocks got the slyness of a fox
I can see it at the top like I’m eyeing up a cop so hold up
Stop everything feel as we never been, nah, hell nah, we ain't breaking bread

We should break our bread, should we break your bread? We should break bread
We should break our bread, should break our bread, we should break bread
We should break our bread, should we break your bread? We should break bread
We should break our bread, should break our bread, we should break bread
