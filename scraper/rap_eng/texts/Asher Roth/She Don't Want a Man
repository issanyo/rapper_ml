[Intro: Asher Roth]
She don't want a man, man, man, man
She just wanna dance, just dance

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Quiet and confident, not a bit, I'm the shit
Screaming out, out loud, right now, "I'm the shit"
Let 'em know, let it go, feelin' sexy, feelin' grown
I be sippin' on patron mixed with pineapple
Then she looks up, spots me only for a sec
But in that moment, our eyes locked, I swear that we had sex
Yeah, in that tank top, tight jeans, high heels, nice teeth
Ooh, I think she likes me but, but it be unlikely

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Ain't looking for no man, man
Really just came here to dance, dance
On the dance floor (I know you want my body, body)
On the dance floor (But I just came to party, party)
Ain't looking for romance-mance
Really just came to dance, dance
On the dance floor (I know you want my body, body)
On the dance floor (But I just came to party, party)

[Post-Hook: Asher Roth]
She don't want a man, man, man, man, man
She just wants to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
She don't want a man, man
She just wants to dance on the dance floor

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
I see Boyder and ask him, "Yo, can you take her fat friend?"
He laughs and then digs it, "Hell yeah, I'll be your wingman"
We two-step, we groovin', we dancing, we movin'
The crowd, weave through it, people getting (real stupid!)
Check my breath, then my sweat on my chest and my pits
Yeah, I'm fresh, super fresh, I would do me in a sec
'bout to get my dance on, so I put my hands on her
Then she frowns, turns around with a look like

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Ain't looking for no man, man
Really just came here to dance, dance
On the dance floor (I know you want my body, body)
On the dance floor (But I just came to party, party)
Ain't looking for romance-mance
Really just came to dance, dance
On the dance floor (I know you want my body, body)
On the dance floor (But I just came to party, party)

[Post-Hook: Asher Roth]
She don't want a man, man, man, man, man, man
She just wants to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
She don't want a man, man
She just wants to dance on the dance floor

[Bridge: Keri Hilson & Asher Roth]
Boy, you need to cool down 'cause I'm way too hot
Too hot, too hot, too hot, too hot
Girl, you need to cool out 'cause you not that hot
That hot (What?) that hot, that hot, that hot
See, I'm just tryna cool down 'cause I'm way too hot
Too hot, too hot, too hot, too hot
Girl, you need to cool out 'cause you not that hot
I'm just playing, I'm just hating, girl, you way too hot

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Ain't looking for no man, man
Really just came here to dance, dance
On the dance floor (I know you want my body, body)
On the dance floor (But I just came to party, party)
Ain't looking for romance-mance
Really just came to dance, dance
On the dance floor (I know you want my body, body)
On the dance floor (But I just came to party, party)

[Post-Hook: Asher Roth]
She don't want a man, man, man, man, man, man
She just wants to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
She don't want a man, man
She just wants to dance on the dance floor
