[Intro: Buddy]
Yo, yeah, check it

[Hook: Buddy]
These are my rap hands, look at my rap hands
I got my rap hands, these are my rap hands
Look at my rap hands, I got my rap hands
These are my rap hands, look at my rap hands
Yo, twiddle my fingers while I'm twisting my weed up
Twiddle my fingers while I'm kicking the lingo
Twiddle my fingers while I'm twisting my weed up
Twiddle my fingers while I'm kicking the lingo

[Verse 1: Buddy]
Yo, yo, yo these are my rap hands, this is my rap stance
I got my hands up, I am a black man
Now I'm in hand cuffs, this is your last chance
Tell Uncle Sam I be god damned
I ball my fists up and crack my knuckles
You make me sick what, don't make me punch you
I got my palm read, guess what my palm said
I got my money right, I'm touching long bread
I'm in my rap car, I am a rap star
These are my rap bars, they call me Raptar
That is my avatar, I am a dinosaur
I am a carnivore, can't even rap no more

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
Alright, I got you then, it's not a problem man
I got a lot of things to say, it's out of hand
These other rappers man, out of style, out of fans
But that's out of sight, out of mind, I got a plan
Run up on radio stations syndigated fugazi
Playing that pay me I’m lazy for ratings
Debating who’s dating verbatim
Yeah Barnham & Bailey maybe I'm hating
When it comes to rap music, only Kanye or Jay-Z
But never heard of me, but either B-U-D
We flowing so unique, poetry so to speak
Molding a whole new breed, totally whole complete
Colder than four below
You couldn't hold this beat without no rap hands

[Hook: Buddy]
These are my rap hands, look at my rap hands
I got my rap hands, these are my rap hands
Look at my rap hands, I got my rap hands
These are my rap hands, look at my rap hands
Yo, twiddle my fingers while I'm twisting my weed up
Twiddle my fingers while I'm kicking the lingo
Twiddle my fingers while I'm twisting my weed up
Twiddle my fingers while I'm kicking the lingo
