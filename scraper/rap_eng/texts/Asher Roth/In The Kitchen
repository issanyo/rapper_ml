[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
You're in deep water now pal don't foul out Pau
Pow pow down south how now brown cow
Loud mouth shout shout had to knock him out, Ciao
Bail him out now just put it on my Loud account
Steve Riff needs this, never will I back down
Sleep this, breathe this, never wear me out, clown
Read lips, she licks, tryna pull my trous' down
Weed lit, need Clipse playin' in the background
How how, I don't get it, should've got em out already
Little Greg Maddux mixed in with Roy Halladay
Andale, andale, arriba, arriba
Ash- Roth coming through your speakers
Yippeeya yeeah, about time we re'ed up
I was in the out crowd playing with some D cups
Ah now gee shucks, didn't mean to keep ya
They just need a little TLC every 3 months

[Chorus: Asher Roth]
Me and Chuck, we made this in the kitchen
I'm not bullshittin, really made this in the kitchen
Hook the mic up, MPC on the table
Wrote a couple rhymes, so check what I'm saying
Me and Chuck, we made this in the kitchen
I'm not bullshittin, really made this in the kitchen
Hook the mic up, MPC on the table
Wrote a couple rhymes, so check what I'm saying

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
Now I got my feet up without any sneakers
But if I did, they'd probably be some beat Chucks
Beat Chucks, beats up, beats up the knees bump
Bass be mean, make you lean like the Pisa
Meet the Grim Reaper, killin em in FIFA
Kick it in the back yard, sip a margarita
Eat the dark meat, pepper on the paprika
Could've kept East, but I had to see the sea cuz
Fievel knows freedom, kiddo don't be dumb
Me won't leave 215 in my green bud
Need bud, need bud, please only live once
Read a couple books while I'm soaking up the heat sun
We've only begun, beguns are beguns
Speak on you sheep, the Dos Equis He Man
Recon in Sweden, la vie European
Get up out of bed, turn my chi on

[Chorus: Asher Roth]
Me and Chuck, we made this in the kitchen
I'm not bullshittin, really made this in the kitchen
Hook the mic up, MPC on the table
Wrote a couple rhymes, so check what I'm saying
Me and Chuck, we made this in the kitchen
I'm not bullshittin, really made this in the kitchen
Hook the mic up, MPC on the table
Wrote a couple rhymes, so check what I'm saying
