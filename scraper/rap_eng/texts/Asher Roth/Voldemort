[Verse 1: Nottz]
Hell nah, I ain't a happy camper
Feeling the same everyday like I'm brown stuffed in the pamper
Go hard, no mercy on you, hobbits
I cast a spell on your ass like I was Voldemort
Don't make me start *ooh* and for your life I'm not bargaining
One shot to your cantaloupe, make a mess of your garden
No, I'm not a martian but catch me marching out the marsh
Right behind the woods when I'm done doing my seance
One wack fucker going one step beyond
[?] hip-hop, bring it back
A bunch of bullshit from the gift shop, you novelty rap
Want [?], sucka, you guessed it, I want it all back
[?] real 'til you beating with that bat
Skull cracked to the white meat, brain be all gushy gushy
Pussy, wish you would, I put this foot up in your tushy

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
Cut the promo, chico, hand me the damn trophy
Flow-yo so dope, these jokes tryna clone me [?]
This be just the Flash of the Ash on that boom-bap
[?]
It's a work of art, bras coming off
We just crawled down the boulevard, car looking parked
Got bars for you bitches, crowbars for the narcs
So far we been spitting hard, not a bad start
This be sars to the asians, coo-coo-ka-chook
Can't be contagious with the swine flu to a jew
Let me eat my ruben, don't be rude, such a fucking nuisance
I'm a [?] with Mark Cuban (you could do it)
Throw them fucking hands in the sky
It's Ash Roth, give me handstands and high fives on that Ra-Ra
[?]
Eating [?], french fries, chicken pot pie
Whole enchilada, Prince Ali Babwa
Livewire, catch me up later on SyFy
[?] Jay-Z, [?]
Hit the chauffer, tell him bring the Rosa
Yeah I know I shouldn't [?] so what
[?] full of Bone Thugz [?]
Humbugs and young sons fuckups
Go and throw my cup up, sucker
