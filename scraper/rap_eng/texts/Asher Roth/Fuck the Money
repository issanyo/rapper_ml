[Hook] (B.o.B)
Well, I'm a make a lot of money
(Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this
(Quit this)
Crazy scene

[B.o.B]
Well I'm a quit this crazy scene
Cause being famous ain't all what they make it to be
But back then y'all this was my favorite dream
But now, I wouldn't hesitate I would leave
Cause I'mma

[Hook]

[Asher Roth]
I'm a quit this crazy scene
Cause everything you see ain't really how it be
Please don't believe in that TV screen
I'm sorry kids but there's no such thing
I'm gonna

[Hook]

[B.o.B]
Well I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
It's funny
Cause this is what I waited to be
Bein' on stage was amazin' to me
But now I'm in the game, it ain't the way that it seems
I'mma

[Hook]
[Asher Roth]
And I don't know how to feel
When this
Dream of mine used to be so real
I would anything just to sign a deal
But now I trade it all for a home cooked meal
I wanna

[Hook]

[B.o.B]
Oh, what?
You say it could be worse?
Well step in my shoes, put yourself in my shirt
I'm only human y'all so we all gotta work
But sometimes I wonder why I even came to this earth
I'mma

[Hook]

[Asher]
Look
Cause they don't care about us
They just use us up
Leave us in the dust
And it roughs me up
So much I could cuss
But
Enough's enough
I want out of these cuffs
I'm gonna

[Hook]

[B.o.B]
Sometimes I just feel hopeless
Pacin' back and forth, man I can't even focus
So I'm always smokin' in the booth recordin'
Cause my mind races
Like Jeff Gordon
I'mma

[Hook]

[Asher]
It ain't supposed to be so hard
I always said I'd quit if it felt like a job
I'd rather be pissed than pretend that I'm not
And try to play along with the whole facade
I wanna

[Hook]

[B.o.B]
It ain't a question to me
Look at me
I know what I'm destined to be
This is spiritual y'all
I'm wrestlin' beasts
But pretty soon
I'll be restin' in peace
I'mma

[Hook]

[Asher]
And I don't even wanna be famous
And all my close friends become complete strangers
Don't try to tell me this is one of these stages
Man you don't know me, you only know what my name is
I'mma

[Hook]

[B.o.B]
But still it just ain't enough
Cause the rest of the world still just wakin' up
So all the real niggas can relate to this stuff
But those who asleep, still hatin' on us
Cause I'mma

[Hook]

[Asher]
It couldn't be more fake
When they wine and they dine and they smile and wave
But when it comes time to decide your fate
They'll sign you on the line right next to Satan
I'mma

[Hook]

[B.o.B]
Come y'all, y'all actin' like I can't feel you
I can look in your eyes and tell you what you done been through
And I could give a fuck because I got bigger issues
So at this point in my life
How can I get through?

[Hook]

[Asher]
Okay
Yeah, I'll play yo game
I'm in
I'll dance, I'll rap, I'll sing
And use it as a chance to provide some change
Just know I'll walk away at the end of the day
Right when I

[Hook]

[B.o.B]
Look
This is my stress reliever
But somehow, it became my stress for demons
So I get up in this booth and I'm heated
Like 'Ye said
I'm turnin' atheists into believers
I'm

[Hook]
[B.o.B]
Look
A lot of haters attack but
It's my job to speak the truth on the track
So say what you like, you just givin' me gas
So by now, I got enough to drive to Venus and back
So I'mma

[Hook]

[B.o.B]
Fuck the money I'm leavin'
I'm goin' back home after I break even
I said what I said so as long as I'm speakin'
B.o.B got the upper hand as long as I'm breathin'

[Hook]

Well I guess I got problems
Dropped outta school ain't think about college
So apologies to my mother and father
For being stubborn ever since I was a toddler

[Hook]

Well I'm a quit this crazy dream
Cause when I hit the stage all the ladies scream
And when I pass by they all waving at me
But I be getting tired, y'all pray for me

[Hook]
