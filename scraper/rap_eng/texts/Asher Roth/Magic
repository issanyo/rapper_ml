I can't imagine having a simple conversation
I want your magic in the morning, right now
[?]
I want your magic in the morning, right now
I want your magic in the morning, right now

[Verse 1: Fat Tony]
I wanna see you on the south side, yee-haw
We can ride it out like raw hide deep, bruh
Drop, drop, drop like Pharcyde
Got your boy hot, hot, hot when you walk by
All eyes on you, girl, what you gon' do?
Let's hit the road soon, get up in our own room
Get it with a good view, booze, and YouTube
Listen to a few tunes, have a little boom-boom, ooh-ooh
Bitch got me singing like U2
And she drink a nigga, drink a nigga like Yoohoo
Go go, got OJ no pulp
Yeah a nigga flex like Hollywood Hulk
New World Order, NWO
Third ward nigga reppin' for the third coast
Girl I ain't coming but you can't come close
No clothes, keep the door closed
Photos is a no, no, no

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
The seductress blushed, touched and then sucked it
Fuck it, put it in the butt and then bust quick
Just kid', crush the rush, it's illustrious
Punch-drunk love, my martini in a uptwist
'nough lit, puffing and cuffed wrist
Tie her to the bedpost, put her into submissi-
-on, spits like Van Damme
Got that bomb, bomb, bomb
This ain't no rom-com, it's survival
Save her as "Rene" in my iPhone
Didn't get her name, she a genie in a bottle
Blindfold, fell in love with her shadow
Occupied her mind every time that she [?]
God knows I ain't never act like that
But what am I to do with an ass that fat?
Dance around the room, bare ass and a mask
You don't even have to ask, got to have it, magic
