[Intro - Asher Roth]
Oooh Oooh
Oooh Oooh
Oooh Oooh
Right

[Hook - Asher Roth]
I be on my own
Scouring the globe in designer clothes
Surfing on the waves, million dollar boats
Really want to stay, but I gotta go
Searching for the pot of gold
Like a domino
Fall into the flame, but designed to float
My heart is made of shame, its a hollow home
Caught up in a game where the liars go
What'd you say, I don't know

[Verse 1 - Asher Roth]
We all got problems, don't need yours
But keep that shit on record
What the hell ya'll be lookin' at me for
We all just ordinary people
Can't see, won't speak no evil
I peep through that old key hole
Don't think you need that ego
Where them high hoes meet the street floor
I'm free form on fly
Can't nobody hold me except moi
Don't nobody know who gets to ride
Losing control from the driver's side
Oh little did we know we were home the whole time
Highs with the lows and the lows with the highs
From the seed to the fruit, from the vine to the wine
From the tree to the root, to the child inside

[Hook - Asher Roth]
Ooooooh
Oooh weh oooh
Oooh weh oooh
Oooh oooh
On my own
In designer clothes
Million dollar boats
But I gotta go, searching for the pot of gold
On my own
In designer clothes
Million dollar boats
But I gotta go, searching for the pot of gold
