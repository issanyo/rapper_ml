[Verse: Asher Roth]
Homie I'm the wrong one to fuck with
Better call the sub
It was all about the love now I'm straight nunchucking
Yeah it's such a shame when I see these young bucks
Get an itty bitty buzz but can't even write a cuplet
D cup sucking
Titties in my face hit it 50 different ways while I'm fucking
Chicken wing clucking
Blowing getting dizzy on my trumpet
When we get it done making sure she gets tucked in
Yeah fuck the mutt shit
Purebred Labrador
Rapping rabid habit Ash back from sabbatical
Dag nabit that Kat Stacks is a mouthful
Had to snap back rat traps in my household
Now I fly south no doubt
Yea I'm out Yo
Kinda Kenny Powers Hangin out with the Gauchos
Gaudreaus, Eatin nachos and gazpacho
On the couch slob kicking off my zapatos
Hablo, Nah couldn't find no good pot so
Had to cop from the crops in Colorado
A la mode, got the bribe dough from the Five-O
Thank you very much-a Mr. Roboto
Throw it outside don't you know I go oppo?
Dot pro, League of Their Own short stop flow
Madonna so hot she used to make cock grow
Then she got gross wouldn't let me adopt so
Vato, put a sock in it make him stop yo
Nah bro, never tell I'm resting in Morocco
Rocko's modern life isn't so hot so
Doing what I like is my motto
Let em know
Should have starred in Desperado
Whatever yo
Sort of look like Johnny Bravo
There you go
Shout out Anthony Castaldo, Yo
