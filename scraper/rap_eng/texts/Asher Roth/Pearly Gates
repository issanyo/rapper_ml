[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Yo they thought I made a million dollars off I Love College
Got a model for a bride and then retire to Bahamas
I probably should've, my goodness, no idea what I have put up with
Bunch of lame excuses from the suits up in the music biz
Listen to what Q-Tip said, "game it be the shadiest"
Keepers at the gate, what it take for you to play my shit?
I've been super patient, watching dudes get in my lane
But lets be honest for a second, we all know we're not the same
And I know just what you think, this wonder is one hit
It's a product or a baraka I promise it's not it
No verse that I ain't rip
With words that you can't script
We all know who did it first, it just hurts you to admit
I've been shitted on, spit up on, dissed and forgotten
Rick Ross can be a cop, Drake started from the bottom
No offense, I don't want to start a problem but come on
All I ever did was tell you I was champ in beer pong
I don't want to live forever but sure hope it lasts long
Never underestimate the power of a rap song
Never following a fad, I create a platform
Have a son and leave him something, hopeful he can pass on like

[Hook 3x]
We're here to stay and never ever going away, right?

[Verse 2]
Keep my foot up on the gas, now I'm never going back off
Now they're saying, "Ash, yo that mother fuckers back dog."
Sure, had it in my palm but I had to let it go
Some may say I'm wrong, but it's the only way I could grow
Most don't understand this entire thing is out control
No matter how it's going down, always have to let them know
Kids eat your vegetables, stretch, wear your SPF
Give 110% work until it's nothing left
I refuse, but I confess
Wanted me to keep them dumb
Get them stoned, get them drunk
I'm supposed to let them dunk?
Nah fuck that, man I'm jumping up to stuff that
Even if that means I'm getting stuck with just a bus pass
Bucks keep the money, I love the feeling of hungry
101 and running from the city it's always sunny
I'm cunning and funny, something you can never take from me
I know you feel it coming, mummy didn't raise a dummy
Love me hate me call me crazy no matter what they rate me
Or how serious they take me, what the labels try to make me
Man I know that I'm amazing, I'll prove it just you wait
And I'll never have a problem when I reach the pearly gates like
