[Verse 1: Ro James]
Lately I've been trying to see other people
I've been trying to date around
Met her at a bar, name was Lisa (Lisa)
From the jump she was down

[Chorus]
But she ain't take that dick like you do
You got it, you got it mmmmm
She ain't make me shoot like you do
You got it, you got it

[Verse 2: Ro James]
Lately I've been driving past your mama's
I've been trying to catch a smile
I wonder if you ever think about us
Damn, I need you right now

[Chorus]
But she ain't take that dick like you do
You got it, you got it mmmmm
She ain't make me shoot like you do
You got it, you got it

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
Stir, sip, put it in a glass
Take a little sip and then put her in a cab
Words, kiss, put a little laugh
I'm the worst here you can put it in a bag
Ass cheeks put them in my face
Girl looking good
Looking good as you taste
Bet it's black laced
I can tell by the way of shape that you make when you bend at the waist
Raise in my heart beat
Beat when you start
Be free from the scars that you keep
All you would need to the starship
Aww shit, hardships, stars in the heart in the bargain
Carsick aww shit nauseous
Can't go back it's hypnosis make those finger snap
Beam me but no William Shaft
Just tell me where to meet you at

[Chorus]
But she ain't take that dick like you do
You got it, you got it mmmmm
She ain't make me shoot like you do
You got it, you got it

[Outro]
