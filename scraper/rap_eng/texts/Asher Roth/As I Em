[Chorus: D.A.]
Take me as I am, my friends, ain't gonna change, won't be no end
Write these songs, rock these shows, only good life I know

[Verse 1: Asher Roth] + (D.A.)
I was in seventh grade when I heard The Slim Shady LP
Yeah my mom brought it down when I was ironing, irony
Getting out the wrinkles, just a little kid in middle school
Sink my teeth in anything, to think I'm cool
Riding the bus, I feel the rush from "I Still Don't Give a Fuck"
Yeah, I wish I could agree, but I've already had enough
I've already given up, from playing the same game
Every interview, feel like I'm saying the same thing
Like "Em was great, yeah he paved the way for me"
He was inspiration for everybody from A to Z
But they keep relating me, I can't get away, chasing me
(All Day Long) I hear it (All Day Long)
And now the masses think that Asher wants to be a Marshall Mathers
They say "Asher's not a rapper, nah his ass is just an actor"
Cause we have the same complexion and similar voice inflection
It's easy to see the pieces and to reach for that connection
Each second of every minute, each hour of every day
I'm constantly on the fence, defending my own name
Explaining we're not the same
Not much that I can say, except that I'm sick of it
Critics, I've only sparked up a flame, it's on...

[Chorus: D.A.]
Take me as I am, my friends, ain't gonna change, won't be no end
Write these songs, rock these shows, only good life I know
Take me as I am, my friends, ain't gonna change, won't be no end
Write these songs, rock these shows, only good life I know

[Verse 2: Asher Roth] + (D.A.)
Now, don't get it twisted, I've definitely benefited
It's like suddenly everyone wants to hear what I be spitting
So different, the image, they don't get it
It's simple, I'm just a kid who wants to rap to make a living
But Em was in it way before I committed
And his lyrics were the shit so I really gotta come with it (gotta go hard)
But each critic be picking apart my writtens
If it isn't up to par than Asher Paul is just a gimmick (fucking joke)
Is it my fault? Must I be more convincing?
Y'all talk all ya want, never halt me from my mission
Use it as ammunition, would you please keep dissing me?
(All Day Long) I hear it (All Day Long)
And yeah the haters wanna hate me cause I made it and I'm famous
But until you take my place, you'll never know bout what it takes
To make a record for respect, take a second to inspect
When you look like someone else, then what the fuck do you expect?
I just want to be accepted as the illest in the game
But it's harder for an artist creating his own lane
That's synonymous with rhyming and combined with perfect timing
On the time I got left declining and bout to explode so hold on

[Chorus: D.A.]
Take me as I am, my friends, ain't gonna change, won't be no end
Write these songs, rock these shows, only good life I know
Take me as I am, my friends, ain't gonna change, won't be no end
Write these songs, rock these shows, only good life I know

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
So fuck it, that's all I've got, there's nothing else for me to say
If I don't confront the problem, then it will never go away
Unless it is addressed, there is nothing left for me to do
It's impossible rejecting an elephant in the room
Say goodbye to all the bullshit, notions pre-conceived
So long to all the blogs, coulda sworn they knew me
If you have no further questions and can't think of other thoughts
Then I'd like to introduce you to Asher Paul Roth, dawg

[Chorus: D.A.]
Take me as I am, my friends, ain't gonna change, won't be no end
Write these songs, rock these shows, only good life I know
Take me as I am, my friends, ain't gonna change, won't be no end
Write these songs, rock these shows, only good life I know
