[Verse 1: Jeff Bernet]
I know you're working late but how was your day
How you feeling what's good
I'm saying I can hardly wait
Lady andele, make a stop in my hood
We can sip on some wine clear
Mind have a conversation
I'll let you have my full attention
I'm saying come through

[Chorus: Asher Roth]
I promise to be gentle
Why don't you come thru
Girl you've got something special

[Verse 2: Jeff Bernet]
Now let me ease your thoughts
Girl what do you want
Anything we can do
If you wanna step out for a walk
Have some quality talks
Grab a drink or a few
We can sip on some wine
Clear mind, have a conversation
I'm saying come thru

[Chorus: Asher Roth]
I promise to be gentle
Why don't you come through
Girl, you've got something special, come through

[Chorus: Asher Roth]
I promise to be gentle
Why don't you come thru
Girl you've got something special
