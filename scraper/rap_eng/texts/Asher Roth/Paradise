I got a text message the other day, saying Asher Roth was through, and the Greenhouse Effect legacy is dead
So I hit Dram, then I called Asher, and I said we got some unfinished business to handle
Let's show 'em how it's truly done
So to the nonbelievers: Greenhouse Effect Volume 2 is finally here

[Verse 1]
I don't want to go to work, I just really want to bang, bang, bang on the drums all day
No shirt, no shoes, all good, cause hey, hey, hey that's a feel-great
We can go to the beach, float in the sea, smoke weed, and lay in the shade
Case of the brew, ice-cold, keep it cool, but there's only one rule: no dudes, all babes
Margarita, pina colada, Corona with lime, tequila, vodka
(Oh my gosh) Can't tell who's hotter, all the butt cheeks in bikini bottoms
(Ow ow ow) Yeah, that's right, watch it turn from day to night
Faded in my Ray-Bans, baby, I can't even say it right
(Ha ha ha) Live it up, fuck it, I don't need a cup
Catch me in the ocean drinking potion out a coconut

[Chorus]
And this is the life, we got it, we got it going good
This is the life, we got it, we livin' like we should
And this is the life, we got it, we got it going good
This is the life, we got it, we livin' like we should

[Verse 2]
I don't want to go to work, I just really want to bang, bang, bang on the drums all day
No shirt, no shoes, all good, cause hey, hey, hey that's a feel-great
We can go to the beach, float in the sea, smoke weed, and lay in the shade
Case of the brew, ice-cold, keep it cool, but there's only one rule: no dudes, all babes
I'm a play in the waves, and fake I'm in danger, and tell CJ come save me
Catch fish with a bait, and eat it with steak and a couple of crab legs I'm craving
And when I'm stuffed and fat, with Jimmy Buffet hat
Turn it up, I'm getting drunk in my Jimmy Buffet hat
Can't get enough of that, feet up in the sand time
Cutie Bobby super fly, showing me her tan lines
Around the camp fire, singing to the breeze
I can't ever lie, nothing beats on the beach

[Chorus]
And this is the life, we got it, we got it going good
This is the life, we got it, we livin' like we should
And this is the life, we got it, we got it going good
This is the life, we got it, we livin' like we should
