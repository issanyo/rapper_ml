[Verse 1: Boyder]
Yo I'm keeping it a hundo, I be wearing Umbro's
Tell my girl, Yo, I ain't gonna come home
Where I'm from, is a very small town
And when I come home everybody call now
But them fake dudes get called out
Meet real friends at the bar for a tall stout
Y'all be all washed up, y'all should all watch us
Walk down the street, everybody "Oh My Gosh" us
Y'all a bunch of hooligans, I be wearing Dockers
Y'all staring at me, I'm staring at knockers, getting all bonkers
Know all the bartenders, they putting double shots all up in they blenders
Cuttin' up the dance floor, know all the DJ's
They putting my name in every song he plays (BOYDER)
Bring home a girl, tell my mom it's cool
I'll kick her out ma' when you leave for school
When I was in a dorm... do this shit all day
Telling funny stories, pissing off the R.A
Now I'm in a ho' (hotel) pissin' off balcony
Can't find the clicker so I'm watching Valkyrie
I remember when... Oh shit I forgot... I be exposed the second hand pot
First hand on her butt, but she kinda (?) but I'm kinda drunk so I don't even care
I don't say no, I say nahh
Take off her pants and I sling shot bra
Sling big shot, yo I grew up with Schaub
17 mill alone, this year hot
Kick out your girl, mmhmm hi-ya
Brain got that fire, cumbaya

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
My favorite thing when I get a day off
Is lay in my bed and play with my balls
Jerk off, bathe in soap
Watch Law and Order with an 8th of coke
Just kidding, hope you can take a joke
Too busy with the biddies, too giddy for the blow
Affinity for women, I really love the hoes
Yeah I hope that you open up cuz here it goes
I'm a low profiler and go 9 to 5 because the job of mine is straight rhyming guy
No time for lies, I hate dramaties, a soap opera type but don't try me (nah)
You get beat up thinking you could touch us
Got a big dog if you (?)
