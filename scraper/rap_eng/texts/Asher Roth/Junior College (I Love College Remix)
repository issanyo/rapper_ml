[Intro:]
College isn’t for everybody
But junior college is

[Hook:]
Yo last day of high school this world is crazy
I hope I make it, I party my ass off and ditch my classes
And now I have to face it
I fucked up my S-A-T's, but good ol' J-C is all I need
Wake up at 3 grab a pen and a pad or kick a 3
I’m on a 7 year plan in junior college

[Verse 1:]
I swear it was yesterday a senior in high school
Kids decided on which colleges to apply to
But I knew exactly were I was headed
After many days of ditching, by climbing fences
Smoking blunts in a homies garage
(Grinding session)
At the same time holding a job
(I was stressing)
Oh come on it wasn’t like I was unable
(Nope)
I was just busy banging on lunch tables
(Dope)
Holla at a B hind bungalow' bauds
Cutting class to get cute summer clothes off
Rebel with out a cause with a few credits off
How in hell did I manage to graduate it all?

[Bridge:]
Ay! ~
I love smoking
Ay! ~
I love Woman
Ay! ~
In junior college

[Verse 2:]
I’ve got 3 classes scatted throughout the weekend
And all of them have nothing to do what I wanna be
2 years here then off to university
The New Year’s near now a year turns into 3 then 4 then 5
Dad get my life together 10-4 big guys should I earn
A nice letter maybe an A or B that will change my life forever
Not we all play a role in a life I wonder I will get a spot
Cause I’m lost much as anyone walking through the halls
To the young bucks to the older woman on that man applause
Depending on how I feel I will take a semester off
Is it wrong for me constantly feel like F it all

[Outro]
Yo for all the cats out their
Who’s in junior college, or college
Whatever school you’re doing
But, you ain’t sure what you wanna do
So you know, do whatever the fuck you feel like
You know what I am saying
Just follow your dreams that’s it
That’s a positive message from "dumbfoundead" to you
