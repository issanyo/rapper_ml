Sometimes I can't help but wonder why
Why that can't be me
Why that can't be I
Do I have to cheat?
Do I have to lie?
Do I have to steal?
Do I have to rob?
Why do problems always haunt the good guy?
If I was a prick would I be on top?
Million dollar homes, Million dollar yachts
Corner office and my secretary hot
Wait a second, I think definetly not
My integrity is the only thing I got
Being selfish going to get you a couple of stocks
Leave you broke though when everything has stopped
Order to succeed, One can only try
What you really need you can never buy
So I breathe deep how I spend my time
The way I see it , we was only meant to die

The shiny things are only temporary
Is the wardrobe really necessary?
Can it go with you to the cemmetary?
Will it grow from you when you gone and buried?
Yea to be alone can be truly scary
Is it better though to be getting married?
Now you got a kid, mortgage on a home
Car payments, list just goes on
You just wanna live, make it on your own
Pile up the debt, where did you go wrong?
Now its gotten bad, time to hit the road
Stuck inside the track, working to the bone
Guess I should’ve known, guess I could’ve seen
It was all a hoax, It was just a dream
Best to let it go, Time to be free
Know that in the end it wasn’t meant to be
