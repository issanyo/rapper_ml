[Verse]
Man, I'm just trying to make some records and a million bucks
Buy a yacht, have a party with Brazilian butts
Is that really too much? No such thing as free lunch
Don't mind me while I pour 7-Up into my water cup
Little come up, record labels try to break the fun up
Cutting up a rug with Arnold Schwarzenegger's son, bruh
Illegal one, Maria's son? Nah, beat it, hun
Sleeping with the maid while your second wife is leavin', huh
I need it, bruh, if I go without eating, I'm
Really self defeated, I'll just curl up in a fetus slow
Sunny side, I see it but you need to bring me weed to blow
Favorite is OG, these are little things you need to know
Fuck it yo, I'm vegan now, all I eat is beans [?]
Frown upon the vagabonds who feast upon the meat of cow
How Sway? How Sway, how?
That's like rappin' but when rappin' all allowed to use is vowels
Now, pow pow, onomatopoeia
Catch me in the early summer on a peak in Indonesia
Tweaking on my inner being, concentrating on my breathing
While you off center bitches acting like a child teething
This is meaningless, either that or dude's a fucking genius
Chances are your girlfriend probably touched me on my penis
Hedonist, if I don't even like it in the tiniest
[?] with Gigi Hadid in bikini is
As good as it gets, only root for the best
From the East coast but I stay good on the West
More or less
More or less
