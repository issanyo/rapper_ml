[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
I'm a blood suckin', drug puffin', thug frontin' love muffin
Why ma'am that's quite nice, yeah sure I'd love muffins
Warm from the oven covered honey oat and butter nut
Bake about 100 because I'm coming with my buddies (what up)
We don't mean to butt in but there's nothing better coming up
Pack it in forget it, yeah strap on in, buckle up
Nothing but the truth, I'm telling you the truth
Hip-hop is still alive, and I am living proof
And in order to improve we must kill it at the root
Shooting for the knees not until you see the pupils
Youthful of useful youthful exuberance
Music refutes that: abuses the rules
And of freedom of speech, well free to just speak
Let's see that as free time build 'em and teach
Yeah read it and weep cause reading increases
Your knowledge and ideas dealing in the street
While college is fine and the library's vital
God is the bomb and LeVar is my idol
Crime story, mind story, autobiography
Short story, long story, novel, or comedy
Non-fiction rhyme spittin' nonsense now not an option
Squashed it (squashed) stop it (stop)
The knot has been knotted and they noddin' they noggins
And now real start of the truth
So move with the movement, movement of humans
Using the tools we were born with
Or you can forfeit your fortune to the less fortunate
Unfotunatley the poor kids are
Forced to form they thoughts on things formally taught to them
It seems to be the least important part to think and dream
Believing things could never get - any better then this
So rejecting intellect neglecting interest
The internet becomes a nest of sex
Best describe as extra time to emphasize what mom and papa tried to hide
Eject the desktop, inject the Xbox
And let's not stop there - watch this head shot
And watch they head pop, open and then drop to the floor
Keep going cause nobody said "stop"
Our only hope is the music they listening to
Influencing they intution ability to
Recognize between right and wrong
It's either hit or miss no intermission and intermission is on
A light goes on - an idea to volunteer my time, my mind, my rhyme defines the finer things in life
Decide to write a positive vibe acknowledging the might of the rhyme

[Outro: Asher Roth]
