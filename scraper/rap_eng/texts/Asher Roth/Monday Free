[Verse:1]
Hey yo, balls to the wall, man
You softies can’t stop me
Ever since I learned golf and some origami, originally
I was not always this so savvy
I learned the tricks to all the systems trekking Abu Dhabi
Not too shabby, top them off when I got speed
Debacle when I boggle Doctor Roth was in the lobby
Tikky talky, tacky falls across the middle
My center fielder skill is real
I dive and steal your single
My single never came out ‘cause I was way to baked out
Fuck it, man, I’m straight now
Hit me on that PayPal
Give me what you make, don’t make me have to take the stake out
You’re making a mistake, for goodness sake
Just take the lake house, fake out
65 000 pounds of gun powder, kung pow
Dumb down, the doofus always talks loud
Don’t you know we stupid?
We don’t hearing what you talk ‘bout
Acting like the new kid who just moved in from across town
Hawked out, who goes, emperor got new clothes
Got ‘em in Croatia while I’m hanging out with Kukoc
Two Cokes, one Sprite, two hoes, one dyke
I think you said that you could flow
But dude, there’s only one mic
So run like the wind, a fun life with sins
My bum likes the sun light
But some mice is men, so come right
Don’t come, no time for that ho hum
Thumb suck but, but, paddy face
Know what? We gonna keep it moving
We don’t listen to numbnuts
Showing some improvement but your jewels is always untucked
Some putz, no guts, relying on their dumb luck
Why you only standing there?
Get down to come up, what?
