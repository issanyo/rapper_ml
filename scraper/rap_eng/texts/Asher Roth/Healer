[Verse 1]
Mind wonders if it's turning obsolete
Sometimes I struggle honestly with what I do believe
To hook it on and look beyond and tell me what you see
I see us needing what we want instead of what we need
Climbing to its the peak, find the motion is exhausting
Most have lost touch, still wandering regardless
Don't wanna pay attention on how to make a connection
When wrecking a man's treasure and throw it right in the garbage
Faltered, unfathered, our fault that he didn't bother
Wanted to be proud of, now challenged to think harder
Longer, dig deeper, nothing has came easier
Anxious and plain eager, impatient to play speaker
Make 'em wait, teach'em how to thread the needle
People hating people, that's horrible trained evil
On the morning's eve, be encouraged, take action
Only to receive distraction, distraction, distraction, fuck!
What was I trying to accomplish?
Non traditional, non-fictional, spit conscious
Not to mention blonde friend you take shots with
Or take shots at, but might bounce back
And bite your ass if we ever cross paths
Cause you never bother questioning the cold hard facts
Ever stop to ask to get out of my head
The subconscious tap like a Natty Light keg
Now the thought process, coming out of my neck
Spills into the palace of the fellas breaking bread
Seeking balance, getting calluses instead
Working hard, a valiant attempt

[Hook]
I know we ain't dead yet
We've been living through your internet
You don't have to believe everything you think
We've been programmed, wake up
We miss you

[Verse 2]
So conflicted, my interest in this mission
Try to walk away, feeling that nobody would listen
When you're always known to take the road of least resistance
You have to let it go, what's a plan without a vision?
So confused what to do, can't see
In our food, in our news, in our sleep
It intrudes through the roots of our trees
Inhaled in ourselves, get impaled when we breathe
If it fails we excel and retreat
From the tales of the chem. trails pails in the scrip
Veils on the street lamps, all hail the weak
While our freedom goes stale, too impaired to get free
We agree to the breach through our silence
No sirens, no fires and no violence
More wires, more hired for their alliance
More lies to hide behind so why try it?
Talk about it, find people feel the same
But larger conversations say people go astrained
Maybe it's in vain working on a better day
And hey maybe this will resonate
