Well I’mma quit this crazy scene
Its funny cause this is what I waited to be
Being on stage was amazing to me
But now I'm in the game it ain't the way that it seem

But back then y’all this was my favorite dream
But now, I wouldn’t hesitate I would leave

[Asher Roth]
And I don’t know how to feel

Dream of mine used to be so real
I would anything just to sign a deal
But now I trade it all for a home cooked meal
I wanna

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[B.o.B]
Oh, what?
You say it could be worse?
Well step in my shoes, put yourself in my shirt
I’m only human y’all so we all gotta work
But sometimes I wonder why I even came to this earth
I’ma

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[Asher]
Look, cause they don’t care about us
They just use us up
Leave us in the dust
And it roughs me up
So much I could cuss
But enough’s enough
I want out of these cuffs
I’m gonna

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[B.o.B]
Sometimes I just feel hopeless
Pacin’ back and forth, man I can’t even focus
So I’m always smokin’ in the booth recordin’
Cause my mind races
Like Jeff Gordon
I’mma

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[Asher]
It ain’t supposed to be so hard
I always said I’d quit if it felt like a job
I’d rather be pissed than pretend that I’m not
And try to play along with the whole facade
I wanna

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[B.o.B]
It ain’t a question to me
Look at me
I know what I’m destined to be
This is spiritual y’all
I’m wrestlin’ beasts
But pretty soon
I’ll be restin’ in peace
I’mma

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[Asher]
And I don’t even wanna be famous
And all my close friends become complete strangers
Don’t try to tell me this is one of these stages
Man you don’t know me, you only know what my name is
I’mma

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[B.o.B]
But still it just ain’t enough
Cause the rest of the world still just wakin’ up
So all the real niggas can relate to this stuff
But those who asleep, still hatin’ on us
Cause I’mma

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[Asher]
It couldn’t be more fake
When they wine and they dine and they smile and wave
But when it comes time to decide your fate
They’ll sign you on the line right next to Satan
I’mma

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[B.o.B]
Come y’all, y’all actin’ like I can’t feel you
I can look in your eyes and tell you what you done been through
And I could give a fuck because I got bigger issues
So at this point in my life
How can I get through?

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[Asher]
Okay
Yeah, I’ll play yo game
I’m in
I’ll dance, I’ll rap, I’ll sing
And use it as a chance to provide some change
Just know I’ll walk away at the end of the day
Right when I

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[B.o.B]
Look
This is my stress reliever
But somehow, it became my stress for demons
So I get up in this booth and I’m heated
Like ‘Ye said
I’m turnin’ atheists into believers

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[B.o.B]
Look
A lot of haters attack but
It’s my job to speak the truth on the track
So say what you like, you just givin’ me gas
So by now, I got enough to drive to Venus and back
So I’ma

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[B.o.B]
Fuck the money I’m leavin’
I’m goin’ back home after I break even
I said what I said so as long as I’m speakin’
B.o.B got the upper hand as long as I’m breathin’

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[Outro]
I’m gone. Peace

Well I guess I got problems
Dropped outta school ain’t think about college
So apologies to my mother and father
For being stubborn ever since I was a toddler

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

Well I’m a quit this crazy dream
Cause when I hit the stage all the ladies scream
And when I pass by they all waving at me
But I be getting tired, y’all pray for me

Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this

[Asher Roth]
