The sky is a better place
I wish that I could fly and levitate
So I get high like everyday, but that ain't do much
Except maybe just increasing my lunch
And got me snacking on a pack of the runts
Yeah, this life is of lumps, bumps and bruises, measles and mumps
Gotta learn that all you need is love
So I don't smoke blunts no more, no, but I still smoke Js
No beast, but I still smoke haze
See these days I need weed to release the hate
Just reducing the use on the weekdays
And I'm no weakling, Nah, I'm big, man
Yeah my discipline's the opposite of a pig pen
It's neatly kept like my bed right after some sex
Or the nest on a full nights rest, you know it's a mess
Still occupied by a set of some breasts that I met the other night at a restaurant
Requested vegetables, said they're the best around
Said wow, I thought my garden held down the crown
Apparently not, the veggies were definitely top notch
The carrots all the way to the broccoli
So I awkwardly tell her I'm awfully impressed
With the vegetables she selects
She laughs and says "you're welcome, well drinks for sale
I know you want one, yeah I could tell from..."
Well, um, one turned the three, the next thing is me on her
All fours, doing something never done before
This Kama Sutra daughter
Her alma mater must have been a college in how to make me fucking wanna
Whoever taught her how to properly place her pelvis upon a penis is a genius, I mean it
Her sex was beg-able, My little pecker was begging me to replicate for 40 days straight
For god sakes, there goes my great discipline again
Got me smoking blunts with friends, playing Rock Band instead of writing rhymes or using my time
Better yet a better use of my mind
That occupy from that fine wine sippin inside inside, slippery side of swine
Pig-headed guy I'm not, it's just the way it is
When the sex is really the shit, that's the power of estrogen
I said say it again
