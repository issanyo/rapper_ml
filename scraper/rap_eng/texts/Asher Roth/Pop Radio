[Verse 1]
Bruce hit me up, quarter past a digit
Had the freakin' fortitude to ask me if I'm with it (Are you with it?)
Well of course, yeah, I'm sure, are you kidding
I mean, it's only fitting, shit, I do it for a living
When you sing a song in sixpence, pocket full of rye
Mr. Breadwinner, take a slice of humble pie
Sit on down and listen, you won't have to wonder why
Hit Atlantis in the spring, spend my summers out in Oz
On that bawitdaba da bang da bang
Man, it's so strange, we all came from orangutans
Now we got names, shiny things and blang a blangs
Stay in your lane, young man, don't you change a thing
We gonna get high if you wanna, it's your birthday party
Now I ride in Excursions and I call shotty
Bang tat, slang slap, entertain with the brain rap
Want it framed and engraved, you should arrange that
Great Danes guard the strains and the rain stash
Ain't playin' games, paid in cash with the grain stack
Stay black, wait, let me rephrase that
Give it to you straight, never stray, let 'em play Ash

Pop radio
Pop radio
Pop radio
Hear us comin', now they runnin' for the door

[Verse 2]
Lock, stock, two barrels, smokin' a stogie
You call it a sub, my homies call it a hoagie
Turn around like we just did the Hokey Pokey
Low key flow, rope-a-dope, keep it grown, Steve Aoki
I was OED Chanel and cheap Chanel
Jeez, at least release the beats with Pharrell
I mean, for real, you just peace and leave your cell
Took the keys from Alicia, even Beast kiss and tell
That's the bell, beauty owned by Dru Hill
Got them red shells ready and I'm comin' for the kill
If that plan fails, well then shit, you front the bill
If they drop me from the label, I'll resell for a mil
Skills, never leavin' home without 'em
Lost them in the couch, looked around, and then I found them
Make your momma proud, make your father even prouder
Play the newest Roth, make the volume even louder
Like, at the pool, all the kids will call me Powder
Cause my skin is the same color as clam chowder
Branch out, I'll splatter your grey matter
When I'm late for a date
Drink tea with the Sane Hatter

[Hook]
