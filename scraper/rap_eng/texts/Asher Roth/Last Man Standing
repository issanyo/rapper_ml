[Intro: Akon]
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!
Akon and Asher Roth

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
They say they want that hot shhhh, say no more
Had to walk around the block, couldn’t take no more!
Like escaper from the rock, couldn’t wait no more
Sean Con cocked penis mightier than the sword
So I’m sleeping with the whores while I file for divorce
Plain and simple and in short, when it rains, man, it pours
Stepping in manure, second sippin in the moor
Quickest leopard gets the boar, secret weapons win the war
Guessed, but I’m pretty sure that I’m destined to endure
Flesh into the core, Pauly D to Pauly Shore
World of cyborgs and tours of cyberspace
What’s behind the door the allure something strange?
Of course, this is why I came, the forces are untamed
No corporate or dumb fame, I'll record for chump change
Course is unphased, contorted or concave
I'm sort of a poor sport, nothing short of Liu Kang
Got me feeling like

[Hook: Akon]
I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes
My scars and my strife, You know I will survive
The strength that I find when I dig down deep inside
Got me still in this fight, and I’ll be the last man standing!
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
I tried conversing with God, but only hearing myself
I be throwing up a lot but I ain't here for my health
When I'm feeling like blah, I had to loosen my belt
Ate the corn right off the cob, didn't need no help
So, now I've come to realize I'm on my own for real
So most of em I approach em with a Slomin's Shield
Keep my enemies close cause they prone to steal
When friends become foes know you're doing it well
Just keep it going
I'm a red pill taker, who's my real maker?
Group homes and tombstones to feel safer
Loopholes for new souls, lets keep praying
Too grown to complain, I create the lane I stay in
Forever underrated, so now I'm Nicholas Cage-ing it
Doing all about anything as long as you put my face in it
Face it, I didn't want to be famous, but that's the way it is
Way I play the game, no wonder the brother made it like

[Hook]
