[Verse]
C’mon girl why you do me this way
I’ll be good, I pinky promise you I’ll behave
But don’t be rude, I like the way your gluteus sway
When you groovin and you movin makin the booty a shake
It truly is great, tell me baby where do you stay
You wanna get on hooly I really relate
We can get a lunch but you don’t have to call it a date
We could go up to the room and play how good do you taste
You like that, hopin' I bite back
While you play games I be skippin the psych class
When you change lanes and you wishin I might crash
Runnin red lights like "You know that ain't right Ash"
Fo sho I be keepin it low key
But you got me giggilin and sendin emojis
I’m gonna give a little can you give me some more please
Hoes always trippin all the homies is like preeeeeeeeach
I picture you in a slow breeze
Hair flowin skirt blowin over them bowed knees
You showin some thigh and now I’m like oh jeeze
You so sweet lookin like you stared in the O.C
I think I’m startin to O. D. lines that I’m seein they’re startin to grow weak
Boudries that you givin me startin to fold, is this the friend zone, who knows somebody come hold me up
