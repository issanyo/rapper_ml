[Chorus]
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking


[Verse 1]
If I could be conceited
It's a side of me that I don’t honestly agree with
Wish I could take the finer things and copy and keep ‘em
Lock ‘em and freeze ‘em
Want to and need it, but see, ah, that’s not freedom
Like I’m scared to be me
Wish I were perfect like you want me to be
I’m not that person
Staircase has creaks, swear it could worsen
No guarantee, but I’ll keep on working on it

[Chorus]
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking

[Verse 2]
Have you ever been lied to? Pride hurt by spite
Fight for who you like, but who you like ain't always right
First become rivals, life moves in cycles
Barely use a libel, find that Mary Jane insightful
When my heart’s on probation, caught by police
Copped me a spaceship, cocked it and peace
Constant vacation, lost out at sea
Quit my job and relationship, that's why I roll this weed
Like

[Chorus]
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking

[Verse 3: Chuck Inglish]
I thought you were the one girl to make me happy
We rolled a couple ones up glad we made it happen
But I ain’t losing sleep just to keep the peace
I roll up all my tree up, let me tell you what I see
The peace of disagrence, push the word until you breathe it
Like the sermon when you see it, man, I say it like I mean it
Fogged deep, windows up in the truck, getting weeded
There’s a war going on outside and I can’t hear it
I hold the THC in my lungs until I feel it
Stoned like a witch ‘cause life is a bitch
Last night I sat down, had to write
Twist that light, an extended take flight
Man, I gotta pack light, but

[Chorus]
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking
Until it goes away, until it goes away
Until it goes I’m smoking
