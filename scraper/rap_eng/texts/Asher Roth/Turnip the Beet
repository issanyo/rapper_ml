[Hook]

[Verse 1]
What's happening rap?
Dag nabbit, it's half assin'
It's bad habbit it bad babblin and gag gaggin' em
Back packin' it
Rap battlin' bags packed and sent back to the back alley and dragged out
But don't back down or back out
We back now
Manny Pacqiao knock the pretty swag out
It's the last bout
Don't ask how without doubt the crowd shout "wow" would make KRS proud
The loud sound downtown eastbound and down it ??? down around now, where art thou?
New york, New York, new work, let's do work
Who hurt went berzerk and be heard what you were
Doin' in the studio
Ruinin' with ya booty flow
You should go jump in the pool
Shoes made of aluminium
Thrownin' up on the radio
All ya hear em playin is the same damn thing over and over again

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's all polluted; screw it, you
Fuckin ruined it, goonie
I should be suin' it
Tooted it and fuckin' booted it
Really? We need some nudity?
Batteries not included, B
Coochie coo and some boobies are prudent as all the food we eat
But it be cool to see some kids get on that Kool Moe Dee
The Cool J or some Wu would get it jumpin' like it's jubilee
It's a zoo like Zoobilee
True indeed we are human, so we are doomed to the umph degree
This used to be so fun for me
But now I'm strugglin'
I'm tryin to get a number 1
Dyin' to get another run
Lyin' to get a cut on the waves
Man I'm tryin to get paid
Hey cut me a break
I start playin' at raves
Naw homie I'mma never flip the script to fit in with the bu-ll-shit they spinnin'
I be chillin' with some women
Sippin' on some juice and gin and
Thinkin' it may take a minute
Bring origin rap again
But it back
In fact my friend, pack it in it's happening
