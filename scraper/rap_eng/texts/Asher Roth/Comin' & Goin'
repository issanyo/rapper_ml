[Sample]:
"Comin' and goin', asleep at the wake
In bed at the hospital"

[Hook]:
Comin' and goin'
Comin' and goin'

[Verse One] [Nottz]:
See in my mind
This don' popped up a million times
Our destiny's song, weren't sung from the same lyrics
Turn it up
Hope ya niggas hear it
Over ten years gone, ain't enough to kill the spirit
Cause these dudes wanna be rap superstars
Want it spoon fed to 'em plus the hot car
But look dawg, I grind for mine dig it?
I'm a hustler homeboy I don't cry for mine
Nigga, I get it, how I get it in
Hard work got me dividends
I'm still on my grind till the name ring like Timbaland
Or Skateboard P, or Kanyeezy or
S.W.I.Z.Z. Beatz, the game need me bitch
D. Sloan right beside me
Nigga held me down way before the birth of DMP
Magneezy (what up boy?)
These dudes don't know what the grind is
So niggas stop cryin'
You can't keep...

[Scratch Hook]:
Comin' and goin'
So
Release yourself
You can't keep
Comin' and goin'
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Y'all cats don't know what the grind 'bout
Comin' and goin'
Ya know your boy
Stay on my grind
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Comin' and goin'
(El Che is comin!)

[Verse Two] [Rhymefest]
Yo, these niggas talkin' Art Of War thinkin' they can start a war
If you ain't ready for death then that's a part of war
I bring it down to The Wire like Baltimore
Come to Chi-Town shorty's is livin' through a holocaust
Look through the peephole, this can not be Tivo'd
Rewind or sped up, STOP, it's real people
I paid for college, knowledge can not be repoed
Here's my story now, when I die it can't be retold
I got two kids by two different mothers
Got men without my blood that I would call brothers
Easy to fall in love so I've been hurt about a dozen times
But it just made me get up and write another rhyme
See I don't know if I'm idealist or realist
I just know me and Nottz are the illest so feel this
Odd Couple, I'm Oscar he Felix
The opposite but we still mix
Whether we be...

[Scratch Hook]:
Comin' and goin'
So
Release yourself
You can't keep
Comin' and goin'
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Y'all cats don't know what the grind 'bout
Comin' and goin'
Ya know your boy
Stay on my grind
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Comin' and goin'

[Verse Three] [Asher Roth]:
Now, absolutely I've been blessed with opportunity
I'll
Shake the hand, show respect, no matter who I meet with
No regrets, live my life and take a few to breathe
Then I keep it movin' on cause I got a crew to feed
Like cigarettes and sex or expensive jewelry
I feel as if the music biz is simply only usin' me
With no idea what is real or what they'll do to me
I gotta keep improvin' makin' music from the human beat
And truthfully I want the one, not just the two or three
And if it's up to me then shoot the ruler I am soon to be
Cause losin' I ain't choosin', guess it's disillusioned me
Prove it that I'm proven, when I do it, do it to a tee
So tell the blue in me go spew into the sewer streets
Go and grab your rosary and priest speaks my eulogy
I keep pursuin', ain't never losin' sight of who I be
The truth indeed
And the reason why all you others keep...

[Scratch Hook]:
Comin' and goin'
So
Release yourself
You can't keep
Comin' and goin'
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Y'all cats don't know what the grind 'bout
Comin' and goin'
Ya know your boy
Stay on my grind
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Comin' and goin'
