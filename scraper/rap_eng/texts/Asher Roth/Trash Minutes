[Verse 1: Boyder]
It tastes so good once it hits your lips
I'm like Chris Brown making hits like this
Boyd bring beer
And Brain bring herbal
Pour out champagne for my dead gerbil
I don't jump on songs for chunks of change
I jump on so girls unbutton thangs
From butt and thangs
My parties be jumpin'
Catch me on the back deck straight dry humpin'
Fuck your pancakes dog
I'm in the kitchen with my pants taked off
Pull over for a truck stop shit
Boyder, daggy
Don't chase no chick
I'm more single than a Chase Ut hit
Girls in the sack don't fake no shit

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
Pass me the ball
Ash to the Roth
Mark Madsen, I'm the last to be called
Asher, you're on
Trash minutes, dog
One dumb pass and I'm fast to be gone
Cut class, punk ass
Ask any prof
Run laps, fun fact, laughed when I saw
Harold and Maude for the very first time
Should have been signed from my very first rhyme
Rhyme for a cause
Rhyme all because I can talk, I can walk, I can breathe, I can smoke on the weed that I need to evoke all the thoughts that I wrote all alone in the zone in the John
Tall as Vince Vaughn when I'm laying on the lawn
Pass the popcorn, yeah, we smoke marijuana
Kinda want mom's, maybe it's chicken parm, wait
I think I'm wrong, let me get a gin and tonic
Sonic, spitting something similar to Sonic
Street Fighter 2, motherfucker, you, who want it?
You could be Ryu, I'll just come with E. Honda
Hundred Hand Slap when I get in that vagina
Light up, let me get a pint of apple cider
Better than me getting head brighter than some
Vitamin, you're in for a treat, Wall Street
When that bull speak heat, raw meat, all me
Fall feet first when that car seat's on lean
Party hard like I was Chris Farley
