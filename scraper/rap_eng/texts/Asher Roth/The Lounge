[Pete Rockwell]
Johnny, get on the piano, let's do this
Thirty years in the business...

[Asher Roth]
What's up? What's up?

[Pete Rockwell]
I want to welcome everybody to the Lounge

[Asher Roth]
You know...

[Pete Rockwell]
You've heard of Rapper's Delight? Well, I'm delightful
I got my buddy Asher Roth with me, straight out of the Philadelphia, PA
Here's a little Ham 'N' Eggs coming right at you...

[Asher Roth]
Yo, I got a question (What's that?)
What's a rapper look like?
Is he tan? Is he black? White?
Is he blacked out, high on the crack pipe?
Or more the cats that'll ride on the half-pipe?
Don't want to act like I know about the rap type
Cause matter of fact I can't grasp who rap likes
With their cash do they stash for retirement?
Or go for finer things like rides and diamonds and...?
Another question (What's that?)
How do they dress?
Are they best cut threads or are they spend less
I'm interested, it's caught my attention
Yo, does everybody in rap get arrested?
And with they sex, do they all have hoes?
Or do some have a girl that they learn and they grow with?
I like to know, what makes a rapper?
It might be me, but I don't think it matters

[Hook]
What does he look like?
Nobody knows?
He's just a rapper in plain clothes
When the curtain falls, after the show
Where does he go? Nobody knows

[Asher Roth]
Yo, now it's your call, short, fat, or tall?
What if he's a she and not a he at all?
Or does a broad have to a be a C at least?
Or can it be decreased if she real up on the beat?
And is she realer if she raised in the street?
Or can they still feel her if she raised in CT?
And if they spit do they have to have kids?
Or can they have a mom, a dad, and little sis?
And in the morning do they have to have grits?
Or can they favorite breakfast be eggs Benedict?
It makes me think, is there a rapping type?
And if so, yo, what's a rapper like?
And do they sell drugs, or go to school?
Cocaine or college, tell me what's the rule
I'd like to know, what makes a rapper?
It might be me, but I don't think it matters

[Hook]
What does he look like?
Nobody knows?
He's just a rapper in plain clothes
When the curtain falls, after the show
Where does he go? Nobody knows

[Asher Roth]
My name's Asher (Hi, Asher)
And those who care to ask, I tell them I'm a rapper (A rapper)
But I don't look like it, not one bit
I'm short and thin with some pale-ass skin (That's right)
Got one girlfriend and I love her
With two sisters, a father, and a mother
I guess I'm different, like no other
But you can't judge a book by it's cover
I write about what I feel, see, live
My boys like to say I'm the realist it gets
Sometimes I feel like Boston gets
Maybe flip the script on some ROY-G-BIV
Whatever the mood, no matter what I listen to
I always do me, never do you
I'd like to know, what makes a rapper?
It might be me, but I don't think it matters

[Hook]
What does he look like?
Nobody knows?
He's just a rapper in plain clothes
(Johnny, I'm loving that piano)
When the curtain falls, after the show
Where does he go? Nobody knows

[Pete Rockwell]
Oh yeah, once again this is Pete Rockwell, Asher Roth
The Leopard Lounge, everyone
In the back room... gets a little pep in your step
As the homies say: this thing is jamming
Pour me another Scotch, Margot
I'm just loving this right now
Thirty years in the business; still banging out the hits
This is Pete Rockwell, baby, Asher Roth, signing off
