[Intro]
If I gave you my love
Tell you what I do

[Verse 1]
You know this shit, I grow this shit
My modus operandi is devoted to the rhyming
Take the time out to remind them
Watch your heiny right behind you
Lions hide and strike in silence
I'm giant, intertwined with Iron Mike and Kobe Bryant
Cause I am reaching new heights now that I'm defying science
I provide entire slices, all depends how big my pie is, but
I forgot the apricot
Gosh, I'm such a Roger klutz
Knocking sake back with Knoblauch at the opera
Na unh ma ma Babar memoir
I recall it all my dar armed in Upper Darby
Call it karma if you want, when my alarm went off it startled ya
Finish what we started bruh
Departed down the closest road, slowly heading north, let's go

[Verse 2]
A forest or scorched Earth
Morphed into Steven Dorf
A touristy poor world
Unsure what it's even worth
Even worse, my torso's torn, between the two doors
Endorsing the core source, which do I want more?
Is it reality or fantasy
Xanax in my pantry
I supplant the frantic manic depression, utter insanity
Fans and upper management can't understand my planets yet
My plans to be a man, I can stand up
So I vanished quick. My stance on this is scandalous
Fanciness is damaging
Don't let em mix your standards up
Plant your hands and handle it
This game, I put my stamp on it
Handprints in the sand, I'm like a phantom
I'mma scram and dismantle the can that they crammed me in
