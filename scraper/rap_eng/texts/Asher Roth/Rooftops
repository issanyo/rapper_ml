[Verse 1: Luke Christopher]
Chim chimney chim chim chiroo
Nigga, I can build my own path so why would I follow you?
See here we're all sinners, select few is winners
The rest is cartoons resemble the great pretenders
But I don't need a mentor; y'all niggas can't shake me
Warm welcome with tea for those who wanna hate me
So you should stand back cause lately
I'm holding on to everybody trying to escape me
And the world is such a funny, funny place
So the moon looks upon us with a funny, funny face
I whisper to the sun saying, make a sunny place
Where we don't make money, it's funny cause money makes... us

[Hook: Luke Christopher & Asher Roth]
Well, you said "get off the rooftops
You're just a kid with a dream"
But I'm like "yo look at you pops, you ain't as wise as you seem"
I never wanna see the world as something routine
Y'all memorizing lines but I'm reading in between
Don't wanna wake up realizing my girl's a machine
The rooftops ain't a bad place to be

[Asher Roth]
Ay yo, fee fi fo fum, fiddler on the hot tin
Cat Stevens in this wild world, where do I begin?
Gander propaganda, yeah the planet's got a lot of spin
Coming out of pocket for a profit: can you spot a cent?
The products they shopping got us hooting and hollering
Dollars hypnotic, it got us using Klonopin
Loosen up stupid, should dry, drinking some water then
Fool be Duke Nukem, the writing is on the wall again
Stall them man, get up off the ground just to fall again
All events planned, after all, Ash is all I am
Hard to plant in sand, pass it on, telling all your friends
We can be the tallest if we wanted, but it all depends on us

[Hook: Luke Christopher & Asher Roth]
