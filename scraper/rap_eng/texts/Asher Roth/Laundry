[Intro]
Yo, can we bum a cigarette?
Yeah, go ahead
Alright, you ready

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Wish I could teleport or I could be a Transformer
[? ] out of quarter, out of order
On the corner selling porn, Jack Horner
Thumb on my plumbs, I'm a real Jeff Hornacek
Set, cut the check, wanna move to California
Married and divorced all up in the same summer
Suzanne Somers and the lube hand warmer
Camcorder on, drive me home Land Rover
Aristocrat, bureaucrat, diplomat
Listening to Juelz, it made me wanna rap
Now I'm on his track and these girls all on me
Telling me my perfume smells like clean laundry
Dog Bounty Hunter bought his drier sheets too
Clean underwear got me feeling brand new like woo

[Hook: Asher Roth & Michael Christmas]
Smells like laundry (Fresh), smells like laundry
(Back when you was asking me to rap
And girls smell fresh like laundry out the pack)
Smells like laundry (Fresh)
Smells like laundry (Fresh), smells like laundry
(Back when you was asking me to rap
And girls smell fresh like laundry out the pack)

[Verse 2: Michael Christmas]
Now they smell like Henny and some reggie in the sack
Jazz in the background, cigarette ashes
Niggas spend money on spinners
Laundry detergent, expensive ass dinners
Niggas used to buy Backwoods for the lil ones
This sound like Harlem Shake, I'ma kill 'em
Got-ta-got-ta-nah-nah Otis
I feel like Jigga in a Focus
Backpack with a twan sack they ain't noticed
Cause out here you could smoke weed in the open
Don't be a menace to church
And don't ask how niggas did work
Cause every time I got a stain on my shirt
I was coming out the mud like a Diglett in the dirt

[Hook]
Smells like laundry (Fresh), smells like laundry
(Back when you was asking me to rap
And girls smell fresh like laundry out the pack)
Smells like laundry (Fresh)
Smells like laundry (Fresh), smells like laundry
(Back when you was asking me to rap
And girls smell fresh like laundry out the pack)

[Verse 3: Larry June]
Bending corners, fifteens bumping
All black looking like I'm up to something
I don't give a fuck, I'm still mobbing on 'em
Just bought a new Hammer, I might slide on 'em
Now the phone ringing, that's the bitch calling
She just hit a lick and I need it all
She was in the town, I was in the [?]
Checked twenty bands then I killed the throat
I met a bad hipster bitch at Trader Joe's
One thing that Larry hates is hater hoes
Dippin' (dab), yokin' (slide), mobbin'(mob), smokin'(hee hee), bad bitches(god), (dab), stripping(ay), horny
Now it's two in the morning and the bitch catting off
Smelling like fresh laundry when I'm on a bitch couch
Hit my nigga Chuck phone then I slide to the south
Got a wammy in the kitchen, hundred thousand in the couch
Nigga smellin' like laundry

[Hook]
Smells like laundry (Fresh), smells like laundry
(Back when you was asking me to rap
And girls smell fresh like laundry out the pack)
Smells like laundry (Fresh)
Smells like laundry (Fresh), smells like laundry
(Back when you was asking me to rap
And girls smell fresh like laundry out the pack)
