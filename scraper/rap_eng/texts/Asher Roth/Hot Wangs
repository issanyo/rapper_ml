A little marijuana
I'm waking at the crack of dawn, taking a hit out of the bong
Cause you know I got a pot thang, pot thang, pot thang
Word, now I'm stoned and all alone
It's like 3 up in the morning east coast
So you know I need some hot wangs
Some chopsticks for my lo mein
Word, grab a bowl of, of cereal
Or maybe make a sandwich of whatever's left over
From last night's fast life, escargot
Rap tight, back by best live show
Roll with the punches, just go with the flow
It's whatever for a second, I'm just getting in the zone
I'm Mick Jagger, I am never even home
Ever since I pulled the sword from the stone
Left a note, told Mom it's a no
If she asks if my ass be back for the show
Nope, gotta work, but maybe for dessert
It's a whole lot of hours when you take over the earth
It hearts being so damn good, it gets worse
Pervert, like a big old chest and wet shirt
No sex yet, let's get to head first cause
When I get to 3rd I slide in head first
Ready set, then I spit the best verse
When I get up on the record
I'm gonna make your neck work
My net worth is invested in the words
Obsessed with the text, yeah, I love literature
But it burns, rap's getting on my nerves
Everything nowadays watered down for the herbs
The real shit seems to stay under the dirt
Swept under the rug, left on the curb cause
Not yet, just resting in the 'burbs
Just takin' deep breath before getting back to work
But now it's back on, taking out the wax-off
It's all for the love of the Ash Roth
Chillin' in the back yard, kickin it with hack saw
He's an alcoholic with a bad cough
It doesn't matter he's an asshole
But plenty of us who make bad calls
But only one can change the outcome
So change it now before change is outdone
Mind over matter, but with money on my mind
I can't think of nothing, it's such a funny design
Yeah one of a kind, taking one at a time
Letting men up on the singing that be free as a fly
Free as a freestyle that be on the fly
Fees on my freestyle got a G on the side
Oh me, oh my, my what a divine
In the park on a Sunday with a sunny delight
