[Intro: Stevie Stone]
Your body be hypnotizing when you see me high
And I don't want to wait another day, another minute
Cuz once lost a minute you can't deny (can't deny)
Yeah, I'm having visions, just me and you and all the positions
So write your number down, D talk to her

[Verse 1: Darrein Safron]
I say girl I see you watching me
But you don't want to seem easy
So baby get on top of me, I promise imma make it easy
There’s no need to be shy baby
Cuz I'mma do it all for you
Just come a little closer baby, tell me what you tryna do

[Chorus: Stevie Stone & Darrein Safron]
(Imma make your body rock) huh uuhh

Am, imma gonna make your body rock
(Imma make your body rock) [x4]

[Verse 2: Darrein Safron]
Baddest girl in the club, yeah you've got them all tripping
So baby take your clothes off, and let me see what I've been missing
Shorty you so fine, just wanna do it all for you
My car is waiting outside baby tell me what you tryna to do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Stevie Stone]
I'm a real man to you, give it your best shot
It’s mandatory, I'm coming to make your body rock
But baby you got sex appeal, open Pandora's Box
It's no props when lace, chivalry ﻿and panties drop
She on top, This Moment here,  patiently waitin'
She's A freak though, she fucked me with a caders
Say it is some peep show, because we wrong at we
We body rocking the baby faces like we 80's babies
We slap and pulling, you tugging,  your body going crazy
Turn your phone off, it's chances fuck faces
You've got the whop appeal, till we be love making
Your body showing now, you been dem back braiding
I'm gonna sprawl you out, match making
Bed shaking, no time waiting here
Yeah, Imma have you screaming out my name
And every curve imma learn, make your brain
Have you body rock

[Chorus]
