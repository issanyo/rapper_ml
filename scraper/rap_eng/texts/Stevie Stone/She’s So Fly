[Hook: Peetah Morgan]
She got style, she got grace
She got flow, she got taste
She got it all, she don't play
Shes so fly and she know she got it going on
Just look at how she do her thing
She so fly
Everything about her, just a perfect ten
She so fly

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
So fly like a butterfly
First class in the bird seat
Pretty smile she be televised
Sex texting in the emojis
So classy but she's so hood
Body banging got a full clip
Other niggas was intimidated
But I knew what to do with her
Cop up I was coming through
Appreciating on your elegance
East side of the Lou
Impressing me with your intelligence
The big boss came through
I get a sense of all the jealousy
And never mind what they're telling me
I love it when, when you walk through
There be mad girls but they not you
When I like you when the night new
Way back when was the right move
Your competition is irrelevant
They need a little more development
Your very scent I love the smell of it
And I be in the next sellin' it

[Hook: Peetah Morgan]
She got style, she got grace
She got flow, she got taste
She got it all, she don't play
Shes so fly and she know she got it going on
Just look at how she do her thing
She so fly
Everything about her, just a perfect ten
She so fly

[Verse 2: JL]
On God
She on autopilot, fly
Make it look easy, effortless
Got what money doesn't buy
Collecting the bag and get back to work
She want that first like it ain't a second
If I check the tag on the back of her shirt
It better say made in heaven
Have mercy
Don't play, but she playing it perfectly
Slaying, ain't taking it personal
She create a state of emergency
She leave a murder scene
Catch a body, catch a body
Bloody shoes on the dance floor
That's a homicidal hottie
It's not the clothes you wear, what she owns
The way that she combs her hair that's a bonus
Make a nigga look good, clean and cook good
For that good good, rush home
Travel hundred-miles-an-hour
Though it's an everyday encounter
Fly like that's a superpower
Killing everything around her

[Hook: Peetah Morgan]
She got style, she got grace
She got flow, she got taste
She got it all, she don't play
Shes so fly and she know she got it going on
Just look at how she do her thing
She so fly
Everything about her, just a perfect ten
She so fly
