[Hook: Frizz]
Fast women, champagne spilling (Grab the champagne)
Diamonds glisten on the chandelier ceilings (On the ceiling)
We built this life, we paid the cost (Paid the cost)
That's how you know you been touched by a boss
And now you know that
Keep it solid with your niggas, never hold back
Keep it gangsta, keep that dough stacked
Break the code and you know how it goes
You been touched by a boss

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Self-made, generous, all paid
I'm unfazed, the way you and me parleyed
The feng shui, we were laid, deeply penetrate
The fame, the moment your body can say
(You been touched by a boss)
Boss shit, haters singing that soft shit
Off it, be careful what you try to portray exhausted
Halted, tendency can save us, only costed
Thousand miles away, I can have you lost
(You been touched by a boss)
Stay solid, me and Connie were wilding
Now when on an island, rolling in silent tirade
Look at them diamonds, gotta admire 'em
Styling, we built it from around the pile
(You been touched by a boss)

Keep it gangsta, keep that dough stacked
Break the code and you know how it goes

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
I'm approving the budget, we be buying whatever
Living fast, first class, multiply it together
Jimmy Chu's button-down, I'm supplying this leather
Champagne and edibles
(You been touched by a boss)
In the heat all my niggas can eat elite
The fleet, homies climb peaks steep
And flood streets, peep, triple wrap the pack sleek
Deep money calling, won't miss a beat
(You been touched by a boss)
Bosses, regulating no losses
Ride for 'em, pick up speed, feeling them horses
Porsches, have her holler, screaming them voices
Finger underneath her is moist
(You been touched by a boss)
