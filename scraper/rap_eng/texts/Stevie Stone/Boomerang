[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
She told me everytime I fall out with her
You know what to do... to do
She told me everytime I argue with her
You know what to do... to do
So I hit her with the boomerang

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
And she'll be coming right back
She'll be coming right back
Baby turned around cause she come right back for the boomerang
And she'll be coming right back
She'll be coming right back
Baby turned around cause she come back
Hit her with the boomerang

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
And you get on my nerves, I get on yours
And whenever she thirsts she get that curve
And It's the way I work it her smirk might be permanent
When she bump she shake it
Make me make that car payment
Get whatcha want baby name it
You never wanna be with another nigga been who you came with
Now when I throw her like a quarterback
Baby be lovin' every minute of it when she get sacked
And I can provide her for life
And I'm good if she good if she like
When I hit her with that boomerang

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
And she'll be coming right back
She'll be coming right back
Baby turned around cause she come right back for the boomerang
And she'll be coming right back
She'll be coming right back
Baby turned around cause she come back
Hit her with the boomerang

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Said you're tired of these argumental ways yeah
And we do what we supposed to do
Told me you love me, without me life's just not the same yeah
Hey, instructin' tonight
Tossing and turnin'
Sittin' all alone with a list
Wishing I would listen, missin'
All the little thangs when I walk up behind you in the kitchen
Gotta call 'round tonight
Since you're coming right back
No one ever do it like that
Argumental playing
Pissed off call'er a few names in the rain when she came
She said I got that-

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Boomerang
And she'll be coming right back
She'll be coming right back
Baby turned around cause she come right back for the boomerang
And she'll be coming right back
She'll be coming right back
Baby turned around cause she come back
Hit her with the boomerang

[Interlude]
(Girl: Damn.. I don't know why I keep coming back to you... I must be crazy)

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
I know you want to go but you'll be back again
And every time you leave me you'll be practicin'
(I'm gone)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
And she'll be coming right back
She'll be coming right back
Baby turned around cause she come right back for the boomerang
And she'll be coming right back
She'll be coming right back
Baby turned around cause she come back
Hit her with the boomerang
