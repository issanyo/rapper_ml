[Chorus]
I’ll be the silver lining around your fence
Used to protect yourself from all the world
And its sharp teeth
'Cause my open hand and heart think you belong with me

[Verse 1]
You’ll be wrapped around my fingertips
But my paralysis is indefinite
And my eyes are frozen for you

[Chorus]
I’ll be the silver lining around your fence
Used to protect yourself from all the world
And its sharp teeth
'Cause my open hand and heart think you belong with me
I’ll be the silver lining around your fence
Used to protect yourself from all the world
And its sharp teeth
'Cause I am all for you

[Verse 2]
I was the one who kept myself standing tall
You were the light at the end of the hall
I followed bright signals sent my way
'Cause I’m steady day by day
So now I’m swimming in slow seconds with you

[Chorus]
I’ll be the silver lining around your fence
Used to protect yourself from all the world
And its sharp teeth
'Cause my open hand and heart think you belong with me

[Post-Chorus]
Still I’m fighting; still I’m fighting for you
That’s what it comes down to
Still I’m fighting still I’m fighting for you
Still I’m fighting and I’ll just keep trying 'till it’s
It's all about what can happen when you lose
Still I’m fighting; still I’m fighting for you
I’m fighting for you
I’m fighting for you
I’m fighting for you
I’m fighting for you

[Bridge]
I’ll be your silver lining
I’ll be your silver lining
(It's all about what can happen when you lose)

[Chorus]
I’ll be the silver lining around your fence
Used to protect yourself from all the world
And its sharp teeth
'Cause my open hand and heart think you belong with me

[Post-Chorus]
Still I’m fighting; still I’m fighting for you
That’s what it comes down to
Still I’m fighting, still I’m fighting for you
Still I’m fighting and I’ll just keep trying ‘till it's
It’s all about what can’t happen when you lose
Still I’m fighting, still I’m fighting for you
I’m fighting for you
I’m fighting for you
I’m fighting for you
I’m fighting for you
