[Hook: Adrian Truth]
I traveled away from home
Left the streets I used to roam
I vowed to be the one
To help us overcome
All the problems that we face
I used to see everyday
Took me years to understand
I'm only a man
I'm only a man
I'm only a man
I'm only a man

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
A crash course with a tour guide
I got a load coming do or die
Stay traveling explore mine
I been around I'm your guy
Size 12 is not a joy ride
And there's a lot up on my shoulders, gotta risk it
Money low circulating old mistakes
I been thinking to myself on how much this could make
I put a couple plates together, cop myself a mixed plate
But my position is the backbone
Cherish moments when I'm at home
And that's a fact known
And yet I'll still be in that zone
A lot of money need a vacuum
That be the wrong idea
Huh, that's just that way life is
And ain't no justifying me and feeding my kids
Any means gotta get it how I live

[Hook: Adrian Truth]
I traveled away from home

Took me years to understand
I'm only a man
I'm only a man
I'm only a man
I'm only a man

[Verse 2: JL]
I'm held accountable for who surrounding me
Who's valuable, who gon' fall in formality
How many confide, call and count on me
Come around when it's hassle free
Who on this side of blasting, who classify as a mouth to feed?
I wanted to be the superhero
Face it people we see as leaders equal to evil
As Aliyah wishing this free to pushing the needle
I've taken the fall, I pray to Jesus we see the result
It's easy to dial the plugs number quick
Meet the suppliers pile the drugs into my trunk and dip
Ever sit with the law then you never saw fucking shit
It's too much to do on this long bucket list
I'm strayed on the thrills of my older ways
When the weight of the world's on my shoulder blades
Luggage on a tour bus for 40 days
Frustrated, save it for the stage

I'm only a man
