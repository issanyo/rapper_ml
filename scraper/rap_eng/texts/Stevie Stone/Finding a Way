[Intro]
Ouuu finding a way
Finding a way,finding a way

[Verse 1]
Working hard, it's been a long day
A lot riding on the line, came a long way
Lotta' people prayin' for me, and depending on me
Child support up on my ass, hell suspended on me (uh!)
Money make the world go round'
Tryin' to get it every avenue I know how
Mama lost her job, Cici really need me
Always on the road, runnin' outta' freaks
Cruise control my situation better
More time for the kids, visitation better
I mean by any means I'm grittin', I'ma find a way
Lotta' time, lotta' sacrifice, a lot at stake
What don't kill ya, see it make you stronger
Hear my conviction in my voice, my hunger
Fourth quarter (?)as i jot it down(?)
Make my way through the game, travel outta' bounds

[Chorus]
I (?)set foot(?) come a long way
No more struggle, Mama gon' see some better days
Aim to, finding a way to break through
Sittin', gazing up at the moon light
Soon everything'll be aight'
Aim to, finding a way to break through

[Verse 2]
Verse two this is for my sister
Conflict come a rise, you know i'm ridin' wit ya
You had my back since the first day that i remember
Not enough to pay you back, nor that I could give ya
Speaking from the soul on the goal makes me shed a tear
Knew that I would always make it, though it took some years
A strong woman, single Mother, raising two Daughters
Calito here now and little Dougies getting taller
And I'll be damned if we don't make it
Leave it up to me and go spot a chance to take it
Lookin' forward to Christmas time, family, snowy weather
Nany told us, stay close, keep it all together
Now picture that, so I'm headed out to find a way
(?)long' board reminisce what Aunty Gene would say(?)(hehehe)
Reverend Louis told me carry on
Close your eyes, you can feel the spirit in the song

[Outro] Psalm 107 1-8
Some wandered in a dessert wasteland, finding no way to a city where they could settle
They were hungry, and thristy, and their lives ebbed away
Then they cried out to the lord and their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress
He led them by a straight way to a city where they could settle
Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for all men

[Chorus]
