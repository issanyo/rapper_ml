[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Ah, no, ah, no, I say the projects says we on that Himmi Hyme
They got me on the deck, there's money on the line
Got 'em all reciting my rhymes
Blowing on the Keisha
Channelin' my topics
All around the region (Region, region, region, region)
It's a wrap (wrap), wrap (wrap), wrap (wrap)
Got that shit that'll get 'em in the whips
And bring 'em back (back), back (back), back (back)
Said I'm ridin' mine all up and down the county line
You and niggas that strategize
Fuck you if I'm out out of line (Bitch I'm rollin', rollin)
Rap game, I tame, I get 'em nigga (Go)
Back down, not a ne'er nigga bumpin' with her (Go)
Runnin' miles on 'em, left 'til is a product wit' her (Go)
Got a model bitch from another island, y'all (Go)
I'm in the game!
Foot work pops, mouth piece problems, Snake Bat diamonds
Off the meter, tryna stay honest
But compare me to the greatest bein' modest
Bitch I'm rollin'

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
My name is Aaron, I'm no fair an'
Your sister's starin', she's in love
'Cause my 808's bendin', Benzo wheels spinnin'
Put a chick at the wheel and a lick to my grill
Man, I'm aimin' straight grinnin'
You smell Hugh Parsons, when I pass you bitch you barkin'
Like a dog when he see a true Martian who's sparkin' new jargon
Sorry and Scheisse, but your lady's really beautiful eyes are
Looking at me like she wanna bigger size brah
Don't stifle her, let me slice her
Look at Nina go
F'in the industry with a finger to the foe
When all my enemies, sentimentally they growin'
To women, when I spit 'em, 'cause I'm a cold niggero
Ah, ha, ha, ha, me and my Strangers rolling
Drinkin' lots of Vodka, that's the ca-ca
You know I can't sang without a guitar strang
Rollin' 'round town, nigga', bumpin' Lil' Wayne
Everybody knowin' that we in the same gang
Gettin' good brain and I can't maintain
Great spending time with Stone, this Yates' ending
Now picture us rollin' with our 808's bendin'
