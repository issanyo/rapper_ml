[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
I said I'm smokin' on the kush and I'm sippin' on the Henny
We ran up outta Crown, gotta trade up on the RÃ©my
My attitude is fuckin', we connectin' with the Ripper
We got some college bitches and converted em to strippers
Now lieutenant go dumb and leave the whole party numb
We pull the model bitches that a keep a nigga cumin'
Retarded, retarded got me feelin' like a junkie
Debatin' takin' some Molly, take a shot of Brass Monkey
Now I'm here for [?]
[?] more gettin'
Try to spark c-conversation
S-S-Stutter when I'm spittin'
What I'm missin'?
(Stevie Stone gone let these nigga know mane)
Pay attention
(Strange Music, Zombie mob on these niggas mane)
Yeah
Make room
Clear the way
Please forgive me, be forgettin' what I say
Bitch I'm 'bout to be a problem in the game
Make room for me, for me
Room for me, for me, room!

[Hook]
I might stutter when I talk, cause I'm retarded
Might lean when I walk, cause I'm retarded
Make room for me, for me, room for me I'm retarded
A little drool from my mouth when I talk, cause I'm retarded

[Verse 2: Spaide R.I.P.P.E.R.]
If I pop another pill I might wake up in a hearse
I'm going backwards in time watchin' y'all move in reverse
Last night I grew wings and was flying over the church
I'm gone outta orbit, teleported back to Earth
But my cup still muddy, yeah I'm still sipping Syrup
I hope my heart don't stop before I finish this verse
[?]
I'm on a bad trip, all the walls started melting
I took another puff of that strong and I started panicking
Me and Stevie Stone, we froze we look like mannequins
Ripper he retarded he gone he on that other shit
Put me in a same category you would put Brotha Lynch
You can ask my brotha 'nem. In school I was extra bad
I rode home on the short bus, special class
I'm so outta order, I'm on that fire water
I don't know when I'm high, dog I just know when I'm sober
