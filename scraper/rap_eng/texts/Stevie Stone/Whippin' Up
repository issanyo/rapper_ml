I was on the ball, baby we've been ballin' (ballin')
Cellphone ringing, keep the money calling (ring ring)
You can tell when you see the motion in my hand
Took a lot of trappin' just to get it like this

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
I was on the phone (phone)
See it took awhile (tell 'em)
Lettin' me go (go)
Made the money pile up (pile up)
We was coming up (up)
Didn't have a dollar (dollar)
Had to whip it (whip it, whip it)
Give some to mamma (hey, hey)
All nighters (all nighters)
Didn't sleep, but now
Money ringing (money ringing)
Had to hit the fire
Whip it, Whip it (Whip it, Whip it)
Thinking out loud
Bustin' jugs, we would do it all night
Hyme himmi

[Pre Hook: Stevie Stone]
I'm ballin' like we playin' for the Lakers (for the Lakers)
5-man motion Gary Payton (Gary Payton, nigga)
Full court press for the bacon (bacon)
Travel all over crossed the nation (hey, hey)
I was, I was

And I've been whippin' up
I've been whippin' up
I've been catchin' plays
I've been whippin' up
I've been bustin' jugs
I've been whippin' up (x3)

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Whippin' up in that doorway
Come and place another order (do it)
Tell 'em all about the the Benjamins (huh)
Ferogama come record me (woo)
Got these niggas really underestimating, thinking how to get a Rolex (Rolex)
Two cellphones really get the [?] ringing early in the mornin' (mornin')
See me late to the stash house (stash house)
Giveaway, it's a fast one (fast one)
Michael Jackson bad moon walking to the back fast, where the cash at(cash at)
In the [?] and I took an oath (oath)
O.G. said keep it low (low)
No tellin' when I'm sliding through
When it's time to get it, I'ma get it ghost (I'ma get it ghost)
