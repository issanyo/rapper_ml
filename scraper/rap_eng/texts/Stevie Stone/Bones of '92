[Chorus]
Simple steps are all it takes
But steps don’t erase mistakes
Hand it off to me
‘Cause when you’re lost, you’re found; you’re gone

[Verse 1]
Context clues don’t do much for you
So I’ll leave them buried in the details
If anyone cares, I’m the voice of reason
If I bottle up a monster
It only grows, grows, grows
Then why should I expect it gone 'fore I’m bones, bones, bones
I’m bones

[Chorus]
Simple steps are all it takes
But steps don’t erase mistakes
Hand it off to me
‘Cause when you’re lost, you’re found; you’re gone
Simple steps are all it takes
But steps don’t erase mistakes
Hand it off to me
‘Cause when you’re lost, you’re found; you’re gone

(When you’re lost, you’re found; you’re gone
When you’re lost, you’re found; you’re gone)

[Verse 2]
Context clues don’t do much for you
So I’ll leave them buried in the details
So kids like me can find them
Men like me transcribe them
Save your futures and save yourselves
From industrial, industry hells
Mimicry is flattering
But dangerous and matters to me

[Chorus 2]
Simple steps are all it takes
But steps don’t erase mistakes
Hand it off to me
‘Cause when you’re lost, you’re found; you’re gone
Simple steps are all we need
To dig up these rotten seeds
That are here to sing
That “Today, not tomorrow, is ours.”
That “Today, not tomorrow, is ours.”

[Outro]
I won’t sell myself out
I won’t let you down
Just promise that you won’t forget about me
Can’t stop the future from settling
But I can change the way it feels
Just promise that you won’t forget about me

I won’t sell myself out
I won’t let you down
Just promise that you won’t forget about me
Can’t stop the future from settling
But I can change the way it feels
Just promise that you won’t forget about me

I won’t sell myself out
I won’t let you down
Just promise that you won’t forget about me
Can’t stop the future from settling
But I can change the way it feels
Just promise that you won’t forget about me
