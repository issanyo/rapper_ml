Could you turn up my headphones please?
Could you turn the music just a little bit please?
The Rap Game's Calling. Uhh Huuuuh!

I can get it if I want it
Want it nigga? I'mma stone it
Visions on mine do it big ima tone it (watch me)
Backin on those haters like rocky stop me hypnotize your fucking disk jocky
Kick back label have to many sit backs fifty singles damn really dig that
Its the cookie monster with a dick back hungry ass nigga trying to eat apart a kit kat
Trying to stay down with a tight fit realizing that every dollar nigga ten cents bullshit
Talk to your sister little sick trick 2 years talking to my self ain't gotta bitch
Rolling in the direction that im going fat booty gotta rubber nigga keep flowing ballin
Lyrically entertaining the party stevie stone and the Rap Game's Calling

The Rap Game's Calling for me
S T O to the N to the E
Rap Game's Calling
It called me It called me early in the morning(2x)
The Rap Game's Calling

Your boys up in it better call the paramedics tell them to send a luetient
Straight get down four leg in it feet first knee deep now im waist tie in it
What the deal but I don't know I wanna come here I wanna slow down laid back Cadillac grill
Wanna chill with them boys in the hills wanna make a horse galloy up fetch dollar bills
My way my time my dreams my plate? my grime my green my fam my nugs my team
One day we trapped in the stream
First corse send the crowd to the floor. cd barcodes in the store
Cop 1 cop 2 cop 4 Stevie Stone and I'm coming from the MO
Say fee fi fo fom I smell the blood of a English one
Rap Game's Calling better move better run hit the drummer boy go rump bump bump rump bump
Home with the brand new kid weigh a ton have me in a hole but a nigga still won
Matches on my nigga you ain't get none fuck were you claim stuck were your from

Rap Game's Calling for me
S T O to the N to the E Rap Game's Calling
