[Hook]
Knows how to work my body
Your touch it gets me naughty
Keep my body comin' baby
Know how to make it feel so good
Knows how to work my body
Your touch it gets me naughty
Keep my body comin' baby
Know how to make it feel so good

[Verse 1]
Home alone you doin' the dishes
Sendin' me exclusive sex faces assume the position
I'm a Leo or how can I please you never not an issue
Wide open, ya back strokin' with Stone to get ya body and beat it
Probably me then ya body need it
Spectacular sweet tooth I'm tryna feed it, believe it
I peeped ya body language, I can read it
On call, hittin' all walls time to repeat it, repeat it
It's mo' than definitely over time and the best of me
Recipe is indulgin' in performin' you sleepin' next to me I
(uh, you got it, uh uh you got it)
I'm lovin that the silhouette of ya body, feels so good

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hot and bothered, wetter than an ocean
Legs shiver, heavy breathin' neighbors hear the commotion it's on
Foreplay and ya layin' ya tongue kissin' displayin'
Ya body so wet both kissin' tellin' tho baby we grown
Temptation, keep you runnin' I'm chasin' my pleasure
Double axe yo' body and mentals, demonstration
I'm in you yo' freaky side I continue
See exotic behavior, when I open yo' menu
Pull yo' hair then I bend you, over
Pack it and flip it over
Ride it get exotic yo' cookie told me I want her over
Chemistries vibin' I'm deep inside it now I control her
Sex and weed is aroma
It feels so good
