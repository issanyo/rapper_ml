[Intro]

2 far, 2 far

[Hook]
Say that you love me again
We gotta work this out
Say we come 2 far, 2 far

Say that you love me again
We gotta work this out
Say we come 2 far, 2 far

[Verse 1]
Yes I'm stuck on my ways now
Know you mad and called me in seven days now
Gotta grasp the bigger picture, nothing last forever
Did reality finally hit you, tell me
Understand that music comes first
Still gotta 'preciate your woman's worth
Making them plans, Mrs and Mr
Same things I ain't meaning, you playing games and deceiving
Yes we learning the hard way, argumental situations, we part ways
Back together, no stipulations, parley
I smoke insecurities linger ?
I'm reminiscing how it used to be
A bottle of wine for you and a blunt for me
Then we stuck up under the covers, loving just how we loving
You stop to tell me that you love me again

[Hook]
That you love me again
We gotta work this out
Say we come 2 far
2 far

Say that you love me again
We gotta work this out
Say we come 2 far
2 far

[Verse 2]
Remember we said we be forever
Have us a couple of kids, share are life together
Need to pay more attention to the little things
Tell me you wear a size seven ring
Can't fathom the thought you'd ever leave me
Every other word out your mouth is about Stevie
Sudden mood change no easy riddance
Small altercations and disagreement
Found ourselves at a crossroad
No more second guessing which way to go
Will we make it, well only Heaven knows miscommunication is taking a toll
I'm reminiscing how it used to be
A bottle of wine for you and a blunt for me
Then we stuck up under the covers, loving just how we loving
You stop to tell me that you love me again
