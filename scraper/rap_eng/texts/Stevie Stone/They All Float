[Verse 1]
A modern boy’s best friend is his machine
It took a second to admit but I’m finally coming clean
What keeps me awake at night is understanding
Some things weren’t meant to fall

[Chorus]
One of these days
Someone will come to replace me along with the dreams I’ve got
And make these modern days seem small, but
This time I’ll do things the way you wanted
It’s not right, but it’s just the way you want it
Lay it all on me, ‘cause I’m all ears

[Bridge]
This is the part where you cut your losses
This is the part where you get a job
This is the part where you settle for less
Just like you never wanted to
This is the part where you cut your losses
This is the part where you get a job
This is the part where you settle for less
Just like you never wanted to
(One more time; let’s work this out)
Never wanted to
(One more time; I’ve got this down)

[Chorus]
One of these days
Someone will come to replace me along with the dreams I’ve got
And make these modern days seem small, but
This time I’ll do things the way you wanted
It’s not right, but it’s just the way you want it
Lay it all on me, ‘cause I’m all ears

[Bridge]
This is not the part where you cut your losses
This is not the part where you get a job
This is not the part where you settle for less
Just like you never wanted to
This is not the part where you cut your losses
This is not the part where you get a job
This is not the part where you settle for less
Just like I never wanted to

[Chorus]
One of these days
Someone will come to replace me along with the dreams I’ve got
And make these modern days seem small, but
This time I’ll do things the way you wanted
It’s not right, but it’s just the way you want it
Lay it all on me, ‘cause I’m all ears
