[Intro - Stevie Stone]
This here was all in a dream, everything's getting complicated
As it would have seemed, niggas was stressed out
The rent's due a couple of checks bounced
I was looking for something to test out
Criminal, I don't usually want the style but now
Circumstances have got me on prowl, I mean how
Up in the late night, you can check the shit out
And when I see the bait bite, voices were saying to me

[Hook - Yelawolf]
Let's go rob the dollar, general
Get the Benjamin's, and the penny rolls
Grab the panty hose, Like a criminal
Guess I'm a criminal
Let's go rob the dollar, general
Get the Benjamin's, and the penny rolls
Grab the panty hose, I'm a criminal
Guess I'm a criminal

[Verse 1 - Stevie Stone]
Here's the plan
Learned about this days ago from my man
Tonight is the night, strategizing and apprehend
We'll never get the chance to do this again
Know what I'm saying?
We be up in the alley round 3 o'clock
Off tops, cut the surveillance then we in the spot
Scan the cops so we can stand out
Know the room but not exactly where's whereabouts
Hope you're ready
Lay back and watch for the signal
Brought the proper tools so I can go through the window
Let me get in first, I see a way through the ceiling
It could be a west wing of the building
Boom, we in and we're fucking the shit here up
Looking through cabinets and cupboards and tearing shit up
I got it, let's go, hope that this dream is a hope
They got mafia ties, I think I've gotten too close
I'm living on the edge

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Stevie Stone]
This was a tight fit
Camping out, in this comfort, for the biggest heist yet
Hear the beat, the last gig, before retiring
In and out, the loot sirens
Go time is 3:43, the plan had to go in action when the cleaning lady leaves
And we, we was sitting quietly
Silently, wait til she leaves, do it privately
She gone, we making all way, over to the stairs
Straight up the control room with the cameras everywhere
Grab up all the tapes making them all disappear
The room with the safe there just sitting right here, yeah
This time I'm sawing up the wall
This safe is a beast, but I brought my biggest saw
A couple hours, the penetrated deep
Got home got home and counted 107 G's
Criminalistic minded I be

[Hook]
