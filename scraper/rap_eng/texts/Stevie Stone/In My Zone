(Hook)
Tell them that we home
I got a couple niggas hating
I'm speeding through the red light
I be on my throne when I'm in my zone
I be hitting and this is what it sound like
(Tell 'em that we on)
(In my zone)
(I be in my zone)

(Verse 1)
Yeah I'm on now, craters getting long now
Every time I'm speaking yeah they recognize the tone now
Lifestyle rock star wilding little bit led out
Gritting for this paper so I call this here my paper route
Understatement, blowing where the wind blow
Find me out where Kobe play blowing all this indigo
Bossing up with Doji, Juliet gonna be the finest song out
Suckerfree classic, cause my shit be timeless(*2)
They sleeping on me can't fuck with a nigga
You'll get it in a minute you peep it homie
Tweeking its speaking you diss me ima have you leaking homie
Gotta whole lotta fam and hoes yeah they geeking on me
(For real)

(Hook)
Tell them that we home
I got a couple niggas hating
I'm speeding through the red light
I be on my throne when I'm in my zone
I be hitting and this is what it sound like
(Tell 'em that we on)
(In my zone)
(I be in my zone)

(Verse 2)
We gots to get it over the time my mind and minute
Selling the plot utilize the pivot I'm gritting
Paying no mind to critics I can never be timid
I'm getting a whole lot gimmie you see we living a dream
Break bread with the team my nigga we did it
We suffer within getting my point across
I'm making some moves I'm moving the crew in it and we
All in my zone and my loss no matter the cost I'mma floss
Just to shit on you lames I'm up in the game
In my lane continue to spit on you niggas
I'm staying the same..

(Bridge)
Deep Breathe Out
Deep Breathe South
I'mma Beast Mouth
Super freak though that the got street clothes
And I be zoning all you niggas you finito

(Hook)
Tell them that we home
I got a couple niggas hating
I'm speeding through the red light
I be on my throne when I'm in my zone
I be hitting and this is what it sound like
(Tell 'em that we on)
(In my zone)
(I be in my zone)
