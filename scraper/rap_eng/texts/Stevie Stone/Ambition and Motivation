[Intro]
Whoo, whoo...whoo
(la,lala, help me)
Ambition and motivation
(Motivation) Yeah, (Oh, ooh)
My ambition and motivation
Follow me from the middle of the map the to the top
Tell me what you call that, ambition and motivation
Through the ceiling, us is chasing the mean guys
Gotta stack the ship deeper that, my ambition and motivation

[Verse 1]
History a been in di making, every day I pray to God
Didn't take him in the morning when I wake up
A vision I been anticipating, working hard, things are start'n circulating
Share a toast with me, drink it
Said I was down winning, I just adopted  the cause because the scar give in
Make no excuses, I wanted music, I wanted change
No one would give it, you got to get out and get the game
And never lay, I'm riding like, like you don't see me
Hey, there's fume in the fire, oxygen must needed
Tell the truth, I wish I did it sooner, it's all gases I had Junior
Follow me, I'm a diamond up in the rough
Everyone know what I got a plaque from the showcase
If I didn't know, I press record, watch your more hate
Said I am on a mission, ain't no time wait'n

[Chorus]
My ambition and motivation
Follow me from the middle of the map the to the top
Tell me what you call that, ambition and motivation
Through the ceiling, us is chasing the mean guys
Gotta stack the ship deeper that, my ambition and motivation
Tell them that we on now, now
Got me in the zone now, ambition and motivation
Through the ceiling, us is chasing the mean guys
Gotta stack the ship deeper that, my ambition and motivation

[Verse 2]
Get through some tight situation, me on my comma couch
Chopper tryna make you know utilities and beacon
Don't get this message Mistaken, what am saying see the rhythm
Imitation, reminiscing, I'm racing
Only it'll make you stronger, and deflected, I'm out again
Only your next hunger, whoever knew that a voice a reason be born a sin
The day that Anna met Lewis way back in Martha been, ambition was dead when then
Nothing to eat though, it's getting around again
Mamma make miracle, daddy told me keep it on the go
Go gain your riches but don't lose your soul
Follow me, I'm a diamond up in the rough
Rapping and touring, I got a talent circulating
Rather could do it, I press record, watch your more hate
Now I am on a mission, ain't no time wait'n

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(la,lala, help me)
Ambition and motivation
(Motivation) Yeah, (Oh, ooh)
My ambition and motivation
