[Intro:]
Been working hard for a mil now
Time to give a shout out to all the homies
If you was with me in the beginning now
Imma have a toast with all the homies

[Verse 1:]
Said I'm down for my niggas
Used to cut class, chase saas for my niggas
Was a whole lot younger, vision making Fast figures
Trying to keep up with the fashion Tommy Hilfiger
Huff a puff on the porch, I was 15
Starting to make a move, trying to make whipped cream
You know my niggas never fold up
Right now bout to celebrate power, yeah

[Chorus:]
Been working hard for a mil now
Time to give a shout out to all my homies
If you was with me in the beginning now
Imma have a toast with all the homies
(In your own ways) I ride for my niggas, huh
(This Bond won't break) I try my ride for my niggas, huh
(In your own ways) See I'll ride for my niggas
(This Bond won't break) Yeah, I try my ride for my niggas, huh

[Verse 2:]
I hit the club when I was 17
Addicted to the wrong pussy cause it cook mean
I was just a little rookie with a big dream
Skipping school,  playing hooky,  tryna flip things
Bang on. We can, when we show alive
Those times, parking lot got them hose out
Big Poppa's cursing Stewart bout the folds out
Down Worthy, play's early, got them dows out
Hit the show out, get attention but am use to it
From the bottom of the block to producing music
My niggas Dervin said you blow it up
Hey F.C, hey we going up, time to power up

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Imma ride for my niggas
I will shoot, lie for, a drive for my niggas
I forever stay on the same side as my niggas
If you come in at me and you will collide with my niggas
Hey, four niggas black truck, gotta get this deal done
Meet up with some new faces
Just hope we don't have to kill one
Hating on the wrath of my dog, I get you for lesser
And if I need a favor I got my nigga no pressure
I ain't into telling rap stories
Just tryna let you know my niggas coming back for me
I mean no harm, sike, take that homie
I don't need no arms cause they go clap for me
Only one, I'm rocking with my date who knows?
No Brunos, bitches love me casue my Ludo, so sumo
Got them coming by the duo, Imma do both
Nigaas hatin', who are you now?
Rock a tune now, you know why

[Chorus]
