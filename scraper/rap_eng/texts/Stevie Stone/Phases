[Hook]
In my life different stages
Go through different phases
Living for the moment
No one ever changing
All through the night
I think four than alright
And my pride I can't hide
It's bundled up inside
I Realize!
From the time can we wind
Am I crazy?
Sittin' all alone
Thinkin' bout lately
Go in the hype 'It's just hype'
It's my life 'over night'
Smoking mirrors they arise
I keep my eyes open wide!

[Verse 1 - Stevie Stone]
Eyes wide, cause my vision be blurry
Am I living in vain? As I travel this journey
Got some problems this morning
Hard heavy an holla
Never facin' these phases
Makes it harder to swallow
So I pray for today
Seizing my moment
Grabbin' life up by the horns
And control it I own it
See through my paws
Get it up on my chest
I'm blessed in life with curse
I'm passing with life of tests
Over-coming by nature
O'lord knows where I been
Obstacles come and go
Let it go then all sinks in
This here just phases and stages
Gotta pin-point deal with right?
This is my therapy clarity whole insight

[Verse 2 - Krizz Kaliko]
Now where I come from anyway?
816 think I could die there anyday
I ain't hood but I keep my finger on the trigga
Soldiers good but I think different then them other niggas
So what comes out of my pen is
What I can fill in and I mean it
And and if I keep it all bottle up in
Then all this just so I'm screamin'
By the grace of god I kicked that narcotic out my body
The whole world applaud when I givem my pain people party
So I keep on livin this life one day at a time
If I trippin sip on this wine to make it come dine
And deliver miralce rhymes from time to time
Its a different way that Im going no turning around
Right hand on the bible
Other hand on the mic this is my survival
Never thought they would love me cause of vitiligo
But dream it up from Hawaii
Thats how I feel in my life!
