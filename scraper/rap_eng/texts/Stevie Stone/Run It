Ainâ€™t no one in the game well seasoned and polished
Got a knack for these hoes
PhD with the science

I choose to use my Ebonics
I put my bitch on a boat
Look like she came from an island

Magic CD in Onyx
Put my bread on the table
Give me something exotic
Body shots off her naval, that's a premium product
Holla
Run it, run it
B-bitch that mean that I got it
I tell her
Run it, run it
She said I'm steezy, erotic
I'm a Leo, pino
Get her kinky, wildin'
Get to call me, call me
Get it all from her mother
See we come from the gutter, get 20, 50s and 100s
