[Verse 1]
Strictly for the sake of my own amusement
Making music that I've imbued with illusion
That's all that life is and there's nothing to it
So what the fuck have y'all been doing being human
You would never assume it, all the shit I'm in tune with
Give me two minutes, I'll put an end to the critics
Fair weather fans and cynics, I'm better with analytics
Simpleton savages couldn't manage to manage business
Averages averages they don't man I ran the percentage
Doing my civic duty and you couldn't get to Ubi
Living in the boonies, I fit the euphemism for loony
Looking ludicrous kabloo-y I blew this shit into kibbles n' bits
Belittle your clique, in the middle I sit
The killer city committee meet and kill 'em in third
I'm feeling disturbed when a villain emerged
Now I'm chilling, I'm as vicious as the realest you heard
With my pen I kill 'em absurd and rhyme seven syllable word

[Hook]
I'm not your average Joe
Hardcore, far more than the average
I'm as vicious as the realest you know
Only difference is consistence, I'm considered a pro
I don't got mad dough, cars, designer clothes but still
I'm not your average Joe
Melodic approach, my product is dope
You're listening to the pro with the accurate flow

[Verse 2]
Yo, I got one foot in the game, one foot on the floor
Head in the sky, hand on a panhandle a bum begging for more
Someone peg him as old, a stegosaurus oppose
My Gumball's big and bold no Regular Show
Phenomenon John legendary heaven would know
I'm on a never-ending run, Dave Letterman
My enemies on a Ethan Hunt, but they can't get in my zone
Little Caesar one eight seven your soul, blow
You get the picture, closed caption, I know your stats
Expose negatives under developed photographs
I flow effortless, CES regiment growing fast
Deal intact, fuck around and feel the wrath, hold the math
Ja Rule told me that the pendulum swing
And that only the underground can bring an end to the king
He was looking stunted he stunted on him with treasure and bling
A man measured by the spread of his wing, put that on everything
Money was never a thing

[Hook]
I'm not your average Joe
Hardcore, far more than the average
I'm as vicious as the realest you know
Only difference is consistence, I'm considered a pro
And these rap clones should know I'm no Donnie Brasco for real
I'm not your average Joe
Melodic approach, my product is dope
You're listening to the pro with the accurate flow

[Verse 3]
Say what you say, I'm in it 'til I get a few rings
I'll never Cobain, I'm lifted off this medical strain
I wet up your brain, I'm on a different level, insane
Evident save, vile villain with the venom in veins
I'll never change, like a residue with red and blue stains
They never knew they, would meet me
Then they'd met a new fate
An edible plate, if you're listening, I said a few things
Yeah, if you're listening, I said a few things
