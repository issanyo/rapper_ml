[Intro]
(Stevie Vocalizing)
[Hook]
When I hit the stage, music become my remedy
All of my problems fade away-ay
La, la, la, la, la, la
Soon as I hit the stage,music become my remedy
All of my problems fade away-ay

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Yo, 'nother day, 'nother dolla
Need more of it lackin' commas
Hope it's better tommorrow
More money needa brang mo' drama
The things I did, forgive me heavenly father
It was neccessary
Responsibility, kids to feed
No more chance in penitentary
And me, away from my kids, it can never be
This is when music became my remedy
Horns reign
Isolated myself in a daze
Beautiful musical melodies, floatin' through my veins
Juices goin I'm jottin all the things that I can say
I'm lost in the moment today my problems fade away
Something about the way it make the kid feel?
Hittin on paper with a pen has gotten me a deal
But still, I will, tour and travel to the hills
On stage never find me I stand still
And the chorus sang

[Hook]

(Interlude)
Ladies and gentlemen,you've seen this next performer
On the "All 6's and 7's Tour
Featured in the "Midwest Explosion" video,with Tech N9ne
But now,he's here,home for his first ever Strange Music LP
Give it up,for Stevie Stone!

[Verse 2:Stevie Stone]
Uh,feel chills when they scream my name out
Thankful to God I came out
Didn't take the main route
Releasing my energy, aim out
Fans callin, they know my name now
No one ever said this road would be easy
Keep the negativity beneath me
Beat me, they try to beat me
Even if I'm down you can't defeat me
Music is my remedy, relieve me
And the chorus sings..

[Hook]
