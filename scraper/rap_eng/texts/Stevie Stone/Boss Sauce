[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Grid down, pen too
All in my mentals
I don't know why y'all do, we on fly shit
Niggas used to it
Ride around or not

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
I'm a motherfucking boss
Is you off I can get you knocked off
Chains off braid off gotta tell 'em make soft
Wake off take off beat the motherfucker break soft
You could see it in a minute that we 'bout to take off
Coming in to break the bank off
Sipping Henny we can take a little chug of napalm
Hear the radio seeming like we hear the same song
Day long, tell these niggas where we came from

[Verse 2: JL]
We ain't never been no niggas on no fake shit
We ain't sitting on the wait shit
Simple 'cause we always been the opposite of basic
All that they can say is basic, they shit
OT timing I have that we be putting in
Celebrating because dead or in jail we could've been
Could've been on the block still with them cleats on the field
Running with the niggas that we could've killed
Burning bridges now we will

[Verse 3: Stevie Stone]
We been working up on a mil
Got the venomous in the skills
We run rap circles around, niggas around him
We started from the bottom then elevated the field
These bitches be about it, as elevated the hymns

[Verse 4: JL]
Busy giving fans chills
We raising hell, you've heard of us
Not gonna stand still
JL and Stevie Stone murderous
Bringing up the bomb, bitches has got all the coverage
Sauce is superfluous, showing up with the purchases
Watch us

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Grid down, pen too
Get dough, getting mo'
All in my mentals
All presidential
I don't know why y'all do, we on fly shit
Niggas used to it
New wave, new day
Ride around or not
Grid down, pen too
All in my mentals
I don't know why y'all do, we on fly shit
Niggas used to it
Ride around or not

[Verse 5: Stevie Stone]
Since way back when we been living in the matrix
Other rappers gotta face it
Been working on my attitude, energy, and patience
So I go to paper chasing
I'm painting the perfect picture
We come from the ghetto
You niggas is jaw jacking, they flash that metal

[Verse 6: JL]
Baby you can see we working
Got a hard hat and shovel
This is how wave surfing
This a problem, this a level
This a motherfucking boss day
What you call Strange you just caught flames
Niggas cough gang, let your balls hang
Focus on games, this is all stain (this is all stain?)
We get to the mula, never who you call lame

[Verse 7: Stevie Stone & JL]
Who you call lames, better watch how you talk mane
You an off-brand I can have you niggas ordained
Bitch in y'all veins
Missing drawstrings make 'em tighten up
Underestimating real ones we enlighten them

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Grid down, pen too
Get dough, getting mo'
All in my mentals
All presidential
I don't know why y'all do, we on fly shit
Niggas used to it
New wave, new day
Ride around or not
Grid down, pen too
All in my mentals
I don't know why y'all do, we on fly shit
Niggas used to it
Ride around or not
