[Verse 1: JL]
Cautious
Watch what you say to people
Watch who you talking to
These bitches be busy bodies
You see what gossip do? (Oh you do?)
Niggas be air-hustling
They pick up all the news
These rumors you hear cause of them
You know they be watching you
Quicker to turn to bidness when they know a lil something
I rather say that I haven't been able to trust em
What if I baited 'em got em portrayed it and grudged it
I done debated it but no way to say what it was with
Someone is faking it I probably can make a assumption
And maybe I'm jaded but I don' been hated for nothing
I separated from ways and I made an adjustment
Had to find a way I could provide my nigga
Tried to divide mine with ya
It's the jungle where the wildlife get ya
Just to survive keep a nine and 45 side letter
Just clarify that you terrified if I ride with ya
Dry snitching spike to the vice eyes with ya guys
With your picture lies sideline just to crucify ya
The vibe of a wide-eyed listener
Where am I but you identified my picture

[Hook: Stevie Stone, JL, & Flawless Real Talk]
Cautious
Hate when you make a mistake
They be keeping tabs on the moves you make
Better watch what you say when they all in your face
Gotta move real cautious
Ain't no way to stop all the gossip
Watch it if you never wanna end up the topic
You gotta remember that pillow talking is toxic
And move real cautious
Be careful who you keep in your circle
It's the people that you think'll never hurt you
That'll be the first to put you in the dirt
Can't be too cautious
Be cautious
Be cautious

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
I see another lane and he livid
You talk about a nigga, how he living
Attention will be given in a minute
I sit you niggas all up in the business
He so entertained when he [?]
I put him in the lane, real written
Said he all out for the grain, never didn't
Said I'm sick of you lames, who be tellin'?
Hopped on another for the 40-water
And me and Rocky all up in Tijuana
I put it on the 'Gram, wanna see who on us?
I'm counting on the dinner, havin' Benihana
I think I got a [?] gotta hate that
Talk about a nigga, use a fake [?]
Said talks in the streets, can't take back
Then you wonder why niggas gettin' laid back
You be up on the social
Doing the most so
Half the truth, gotta tell it in doses
Got a notion like "How you notice?"
Gripped the tail, don't tell nobody I know this
Out of line, you nigga's out of line
Out the blue, you calling [?]
Identified her with a trust, lies
You better think wiser who you call your fam
You gotta move real

[Verse 3: Flawless Real Talk]
Better watch what you saying 'round these devices
Showing too much only leads to crisis
Tryna bleed the vices, but I leave them lifeless
Snake eyes got me thinking, all I see is dices
Gettin' with the fame only pays the prices
But mentioning my name elevates excitement
I'm snatching every ear with the strength of Tyson
And my grip just tightenin', I'm the strongest Titan
I done came with my killas, all we gon' strike is lightning
Fast and frightening, gotta prove the sight and
Bros pass the Vicodin, if you even say a word we fighting
Cause you move and you act just like them
I can tell
Cause they wanna bring me down, I'll just give 'em hell
For a nigga, make a hole just to wish him well
If you think you coming back it's a bigger fail
Get stronger every day, we gon' tip the scale
Yeah, underground where we underrated
Underdogs, underestimated
Leveled up, now we Elevated
Like who the hell said we never made it?
In my city I've been celebrated
And you gon' respect it even if you hate it
Got this paranoia I can never shake it
That just means that I always gotta move real
