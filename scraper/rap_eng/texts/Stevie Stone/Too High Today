[Intro]
Oooh
We need to hit the homies and have the smoke session boy
Hell yeah hell yeah
I just got all kind of shit man, edibles, wax, flavor
Time to get too high today

[Verse 1: JL]
Getting high over here (true)
Different kind, come and share (ooh)
This from the town nigga swear
Loud i wanna hear too
Lit why hit a square smoke
Circling in the air I
Inhale and stare (fuck you looking at nigga?)
Niggas that that duh factor (duhhh)
Talk that'll be a buzz crasher, it could end in a disaster
We stronger than it was last year, passing on that mud faster
Girl scouts in my dutch master, started rolling my blunts fatter
Dab out thats clutch after, lie grass and plug shatter
Edibles if you do em with me
Couldn't come to tune
Too many green rocks from the moon
Hit me keep the stress out the room
Right back thats a new one, tappin out too soon
Lung fresh out the womb, tap it I hug and insist
Take this gummy bear then bitch, prepared to get intense
Juice cannabis-infused, this for medical uses
I got hella excuses
Grab shells lets do this
Fucking lit

[Hook: JL]
Ima get too hot today
Ima get you hot today
My smoke session lit
What you tryna say
Won't let you fly away
I need few Andale
I'm breaking down a stick
I got two on the way
Ima get too hot today
Ima get you hot today
My smoke session lit
What you tryna say
Won't let you fly away
I need few Andale
I'm breaking down a stick
I got two on the way

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Smoke loud, presidential, hog ass, see credentials
Wallpapers, bare essentials
Legalizing like whats the issue
Loud pack, bring the party
We be going until in the morning
Keep fashion I was sprinkle palming
With the phone yes I got em all sowing
Like dark clouds, dab section
Indoor and I forgot to mention
Mayflower there's no discretion
Kush smoker here's my confession
Nigga I'm too high, nigga pour up
With a blunt now then when I go to bed
And be the first thing when I wake up
And like i be smoking that ether
High up in the bleachers
Smoke session lets feature
Plug came through re-up
JL roll OG up
Frizz bout the sativa
Dab set and get steep yeah
Stone calls be fucking lit

[Hook: JL]
Ima get too hot today
Ima get you hot today
My smoke session lit
What you tryna say
Won't let you fly away
I need few Andale
I'm breaking down a stick
I got two on the way
Ima get too hot today
Ima get you hot today
My smoke session lit
What you tryna say
Won't let you fly away
I need few Andale
I'm breaking down a stick
I got two on the way
