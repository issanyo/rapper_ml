[Intro]
Red bone first class got an attitude
Simmer down when the collar in the back room
She got the rubbin on my tattoos, little mama you's a natural
Told me: she go (she go)
Body be mean, hips don't lie
Coming out jeans, How you seen that
Light 'em up it's a fling
I'ma show you how I got her on the team
I told the bitch

[Verse 1]
All gas no brakes, being sincere your figure in shape
Quit what you doing when you isolate your waist
And your body stay still but your ass still shakes
She look great, she look great
Freaky motherfucker you can put it in my face
Little bit of grape in Ciroc you were late
I'ma take you to the crib it'll cost you a date
I'ma dive in, dive in, you can go low you can fly in
Divy up yo friends we dividin'
When we done, came up in the play
And today, you ain't tripping what to say oh my mama

[Hook]
She go
She go, back it on up
Drop it to the floor girl, back it on up
She go (x8)
She go, back it on up, she go, back back it on up (lil' mama)

[Verse 2]
She go (she go), bad lil' babe
When she walk by make you turn an' frown lil' bit
Surpised that'cha eyes on them thighs and them hips
Put a ribbon on her, baby gotta get
Make a nigga wann' beat it up (beat it up, beat it up)
Five mic's on the room got the heatin up
She reached down on a nigga told me "get up"
I'm all in bout to lose it so I speed it up

I don't believe in easin up
I blew it back kinda loud but she keepin up
I got the number she can call me and she hangin all up on me
Bring her friends and they lovin all the homies lil' mama

[Hook]
She go
She go, back it on up
Drop it to the floor girl, back it on up
She go (x8)
She go, back it on up, she go, back back it on up (lil' mama)
