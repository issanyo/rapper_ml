[Stevie Stone]
Yeah, uh-huh
Time to fuck 'em up, time to fuck 'em up

Imma make 'em wait, make 'em wait
Migrate, make they eyes dilate
Strangeulators [?] they never mind me
We the illest, we come around and size up your Padre
Me and Ubi, Godi in the building we burnin' some Bombay

[Godemis]
Okay I know they wanna slay us, play homage and celebrate
But you must make it happen, get at us and set a date
Rolling up on your set, with the scent of a featherweight
And if'n they tryna bomb us I promise to levitate

[Ubiquitous]
Why does it take dying for race to make a giant wake?
Stay colossal, a revolution born on fire escapes
Invade your private estate with the nine and this wire tape
Truth comes, many size, shapes and a high-rate
Why wait? fly away too high, but they buy brake

[Stevie Stone]
Pour gas on you niggas in motion to penetrate

[Godemis]
I circumvent security, hop in the side-gate

[Ubiquitous]
I am dying for live-bait why are they eyeing me sideways?

[All]
Wait!

[Godemis]
Time to fuck 'em up, time to fuck 'em up
Time to fuck 'em up, time to fuck 'em up
Imma make 'em wait on it
Imma make 'em wait

I'm crooked as a crook and I'm mobbin to set it straight
Look at what we got in common, be honest we dominate
Oh they smellin' like prey? I say they should be on a plate
Tweaking, I should be eating, but Imma be on a - wait

[Ubiquitous]
We did it our way, puffin' the piff in the broad day
Fuck what y'all say, gettin' the script while the song play
Your clique is an entr√©e, your bitch is a side-dish
If the style sick lickety split they divide quick

[Stevie Stone]
Cause my clique be slanging that iron, this iron fist is iron mitten
Ain't hard to define this
I'll hook you in the details and look at the fine print
You fuckin' up with niggas, who fuck what your kind is
I dibble dab a little, I'm doing my lil' bit

[Godemis]
Punish them with the patterns, living to kill shit

[Ubiquitous]
Strange was the label that push and pay me and still is

[Stevie Stone]
Let us settle in ya mind, give 'em something to deal with

[All]
Wait!

[Ubiquitous]
Time to fuck 'em up, time to fuck 'em up
Time to fuck 'em up, time to fuck 'em up
Imma make 'em wait on it
Imma make 'em wait

Hold up. Let 'em take a second and soak up, the flow so over ocean I'm floating for sho' and know what?
I know what the fuck I am doing, I'm doing donuts
I appear courtesy on myself and my own personas
Stonie yo' up

[Stevie Stone]
I'm 'bout to po' up
I have been winging for more that a Pepsi Cola
I know some beautiful bitches in South Dakota
Can you relate? they bobbin' and doing great
Now gimme the ten - Wait

[Godemis]
I'm high as a fuck and I stay in the fly cape
They dirty in the booth and I bathe in the fire lake
You better get your duckets I'm grindin' for grind dates
My De La Soul is burnin' for bitches in high states
So Lynch me with the cleaver, I need to defy [?]

[Ubiquitous]
Follow my vibe way back in the day from the 9-8-

[Stevie Stone]
Sex a bitch up in the Bentley and fuck up her mind-state

[Godemis]
Staying patient for time's sake and you tryna rewind tape

[All]
Wait!

Time to fuck 'em up, time to fuck 'em up
Time to fuck 'em up, time to fuck 'em up
Imma make 'em wait on it
Imma make 'em wait

[Stevie Stone]
Time to fuck 'em up, time to fuck 'em up
Time to fuck 'em up, time to fuck 'em up
Imma make 'em wait on it
Imma make 'em wait

(wait up)
(Hold up)
(Imma make 'em wait on it)
(Imma make 'em wait on it)
