[Hook: JL]
Burner on my hip extended clip I was ready
Nigga talking like they about to come and get me
Bitch hit me early in the morning I was ready
Police tried to tap my phone I was ready
Tell em I ready, I ready
Tell em I ready, I ready
Tell em I ready, I ready
Tell em I ready, I ready

[Verse 1: JL & Stevie Stone]
I was ready when it jumped off
Full take we was all ready
Rare kind I'm a tough cloth
Black hoodie with the burner with me
That umbrella tried to come get me but I already had it dumped off
17 over 45 on the phone with the cold talk
Lowkey I'm the plug though
Started gritting from the mud right?
Wipe your feet at the front door
IG we be going live
Paint a picture if you didn't hear it
First you look yourself up in the mirror
Me and Stone we be kindred spirits
Let's get this money ain't no interfering
Like we ain't midwest
Like we ain't been waiting on yall to get yall shit together
Me and Stone been ready this raw shit together
Fall off-foot nah nigga never
We on that level to lay that ground
Be on the metals to pack them pounds
Across the water to shit them out
And who concerned I got that loud

Tell em I ready, I ready

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone & JL]
I'm a vet, burners on the deck
Down and round to let
Providence had up on the ledge
Made it Andale
Pardon me see they onto me
Been recording me
Only me, money on my head, I move accordingly
I'm a jet, burner on my hip, in a foreign whip
Press to play, burner hit the plug
Homie took a lick the other day
We ain't worred about nothing
Larry Hov and im bout that Dre
So that one mistake
Could be the last you make
Ima wait, woke up to a road blunt
Finna set a blaze for the whole month
Keep the heat at bay for the cold front
Got a chain on a maze a whole stunt
Missing this is what you don't want
Had a premonition we was blowing up
Like a fortune teller with the crystal ball
Seen it all, ready when they showed up
