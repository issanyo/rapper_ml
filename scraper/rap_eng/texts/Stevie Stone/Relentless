[Intro:]
To be relentless... is to be adamant
Unyielding... determined

[Intro Hook:]
Only real ones 'round here, welcome to my hood (I'm more focused than ever)
If you ain't grind don't come 'round here we have some in my hood
(I refuse to lose) Yeah we grind

[Verse 1:]
Time and underwater when the humble risen
Me and mama getting by, not about the pissin'
Same vision, dinner time mama scrape the scraps
Teachers callin' mama all complaints on how I act
I overcame a world when, family be my motivation
Hustle hard as sick nigga, words get the circulatin'
Rocky rosin' mishaps, poor I pick up for my niggas eatin'
Make it out the dropping back
If to me he be living attitude by any means (hard times reflecting different)
Channel all this energy (How when you can hear the symptoms)
Knockin' on the door though, no money in the vein grind though, hop of the portrait age of 15!

[Hook:]
Only real ones 'round here, welcome to my hood
If you ain't grind don't come 'round here we hustle in my hood
Don't matter whatcha grind, just git it git it, grind, and git it git it
Grind, relentless, stay on top of ya business
Only real ones 'round here, welcome to my hood
Yeah we grind

[Verse 2:]
Trials built the better man
What don't kill you make you stronger, not today I am
If not for music what would I became
I'm still dirty in the turnin' lane
And sometimes my feet be sinking in the quicksand
But this time I'm ready, go let that shit change
Hell, this should be my revelation
Hope that these words itself will use as motivation on the road
Tryna go where no one else has ever been
Conviction for my
Your prediction by man
They will never determine my motion passion within
Be on my ground 'till my world ends, and yeah

[Hook:]
Only real ones 'round here, welcome to my hood
If you ain't grind don't come 'round here we hustle in my hood
Don't matter whatcha grind, just git it git it, grind, and git it git it
Grind, relentless, stay on top of ya business
Only real ones 'round here, welcome to my hood
Don't matter whatcha grind, just git it git it, grind, and git it git it
Grind, relentless, stay on top of ya business
Only real ones 'round here, welcome to my hood
Yeah we grind
