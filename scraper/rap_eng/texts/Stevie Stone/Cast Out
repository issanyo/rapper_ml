[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Stop talking, deep breath

But when she see me cause my pockets seem thicker
Well bitch I'm in another class [?] stand out

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
I gotta be the last man standing
I'm fixin' up the songs like I'm a cannon
Cause I don't know what you planning
Damn it, I'm the baddest nigga on the planet
All you nays saying, the God is here so let it
The coldest soldier niggas with the baby faces
Damn right, independent, we the prototype
Ok, feel like I'm bout to snap on niggas any day
Get on my knees and pray, that you can help me anyway
I lay em down and I ain't talking bout the permanent
But those concerned what earning it
Confirm to Kali murdered it
I never fit in with the industry contestant
Like I sit it
Strange Music found me told me get in
And when I the ramifications, me and industry having relations
I'm tryna get in with no patience, wet my whistle like [?]
Push it hard through my heart and even harder through my arteries
With every part of me, I lash shot, you niggas cast out

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Me and the niggas take the cash route
We busting, we out of breath then we pass out
I ain't the first to get in but I'll be the last out
I'm the outcast, you niggas is cast out

Me and the niggas take the cash route
We busting, we out of breath then we pass out
I ain't the first to get in but I'll be the last out
I'm the outcast, you niggas is cast out
