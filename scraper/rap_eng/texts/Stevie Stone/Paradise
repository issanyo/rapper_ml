[Hook: Jenn Em]
This is no place to go if you're afraid
Your worst nightmare is prettier than this place (this place)
Just when you think (just when you think)
Paradise awaits
Bodies all over this place (paradise)
Blood all over his face, come on (paradise)
Nobody's soul is safe (paradise)
You can be the predator or prey
It can go one of two ways

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Ugh, clock strikes midnight
City is woke, bright lights, the invites
Caught up in hype
And rare heights, to where sightseeking
And meeting anything you might like
It's paradise in one scheme
It's fine things and more cream
It's bad bitches and G-stings on scene
On team, living the dream on all scenes
Weed, hard liquor, and codeine
Smoke and mirrors in the arm slot
School of the hard knocks
The night life would love to give you the long chop
Be careful don't take that dead end road
The scenery will fool you when it unfolds, it's so cold

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Yeah
[?] came to gets wicked
Illusory picked it then flipped it
It was all scripted
The lore
Free ticket, evil energy shifted
It's lifted, it's gifted to be specific
When will your soul endure?
Back stab and back grab and back [?]
And have it happening off [?]
Or
Live lavish [?]
Is your soul secure?
What you open for?
And I'm one to call you
Welcome with open doors
Dusk rises in 25 minutes
Tomorrow you will have started from the beginning [?]
