Everybody got a story to tell
Mine starts in the middle of the map
Long before me
You see Imma start from the beginning
Mom's is from a little town called Malta Bend
Right outside Kansas City
Historically, it's a segregated town
She was raised in the church
Sung and played piano for the choir
Worked 3 jobs to provide for me and my sisters
She never allowed us to realise how much we didn't have, or to realise how much we struggle
Shit. At times I thought we was the richest motherfuckers in the world
You see, you can't miss what you don't have
In all actuality, we was struggling trying to make it just like everybody else
But without struggle there's no progress
Wise words from Frederick Douglass
You see the environment moulds you, and it shapes you
I was motivated by what I see growing up
A woman that provided by any means necessary
Ambition. I learned that the art is the easiest way to travel the world without leaving home
Start plotting how to get to the moon
Shit, if I miss I still end up in the stars
Your foundation is set on many generations before you
They say I got my swag and my charm from my Daddy
My temper from my Nanny, and my hustle from my Momma
If you're gon' do something, might as well do it big
That's how I live my life
Go hard or go home
Run it
