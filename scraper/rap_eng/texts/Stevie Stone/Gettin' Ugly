[Verse 1]
Shining like four gorillas
[?] sinners, Stone going in, attend me rhythm now
[?] protégé, prospect of a cold nine milla, check the internet
They say I’m wyling, wyling
Madlibs, get to growling, growling
Said I grinded it the whole damn way, got him at wayne
No bitch you can’t deny him
I’m heated, I’m oscillated
Of liquor, imitated and weeded
I came in the game with a freight train demeanor
Showing all the lames that my plane the least
Google it and read it
Them clutch free throws
I hear it or something, got me you niggas green dough
You cross the line, I catch you riding between those
This Stevie Stone, don’t fuck with me or my team though
Tell 'em what I’m on nigga

[Hook]
Started this way back
See the momentum? Where's my motherfucking name at?
Bitch I want payback
I learned a 100 different ways that I could gain that, getting that
Getting ugly, getting ugly, ugly
Getting ugly, getting ugly, hey
Stevie don’t play that
I got brains and business tryna get that payback
Getting it

[Verse 2]
Sit alone in a dark room
I grab the mic and I talk to it
You can see the spark
And me manipulating words, all these words
Gotta convert em, pause
Let the beat talk
Start gripping the flame and it’s god-gifted
[?] looked at my dream, and it’s all scripted
Chains lifted, I’m running round and I’m drifting
In every town, get addicted, and I’m forward bound, get lifted
Debated, I figured that you would be happy one of us niggas made it
Instead you be sucking on Jellysickles, frustrated
You find [?] with Ruthless, I’m reincarnated
Stars on the rating
Ha, you see I been a vet
Travel around the world rapping, I been a threat
Ah, you never benefit
I’m so compounded but nigga better check my intellect
Tell 'em what I’m on nigga

[Hook][x2]
