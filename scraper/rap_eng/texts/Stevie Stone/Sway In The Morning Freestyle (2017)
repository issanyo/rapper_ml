[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Spit flame, my shell don' drop rage
And never been afraid to bail out high
Played and will demonstrate a rare on [?]
Caged up, a renegade, I stays real hots, nigga
Eat the least [?]
Peep the technique, heat, the beat gon' knock
Street-for-street passing fleet of equinox
Foley don't find a key, nigga, to get that box
(HIMMI)
Talk breezy, is easy, the game need me
Pre-order for order, nigga, it need be
I'm instructed to give you niggas a freebie
You can call this assemble a little teasey

I think it's
I think it's
I think it's
I think it's KC in the house
I think it's safe to say I'm a monster
Yeah, because killing is my mantra
Fellas wanna see me dead upper yonder
But the women are fond of Ron, it’s Don they conjure
I’m big-headed ‘cause Tecca Ninna stay breaded
I get it the wettest competitive, I just shredded your bed
It’s the crevice I fetish, call the medic you’re deaded
Push and pull, you’re placed at pathetic
Soul is so not sympathetic
I’m on a roll, creepin’ & I am outta control
Women see Tecca Ninna as the matter in the commode
So I’m in there, like swimwear
On a lady that’s ridin' inside of what’s skin bare
I’m so hard, niggas don’t even wanna face me
But, it’s the opposite with their women, they taste me
So many hoes witness the trouble I bring, they cling for the stream
I’m the king, I go by the name of “the thing”
Heart breaker, body part taker
From your lady, negras hate us cuz thou art fakers
Scheming when seekin' I found a tush
When I blow that kush with a rhyme, I be beatin' around the bush
Area, I'm scarier than malaria, the carrier of hysteria
I swear he's just nefarious, with hairy nuts, the cherries bust
Don't tell me to zip it, I'm wicked
Your ladies, they take me in like I whip it
Got a mind of my own, I'm in a zone
I go deep into her like Tech N9ne in a song
You can't tell me nothing, I'm in my prime and I'm grown
My homie Nina behind, I still climbing alone
Ill spit, real sick, need help real quick
See nobody can hit the kill switch
Still chill chicks, come get me something that I can feel, bitch
Drill stick, they on Tech N9ne's dilsnick, nigga
