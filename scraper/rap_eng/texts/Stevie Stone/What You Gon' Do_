[Intro: Stevie Stone]
Croc on the beat
What you gon do
What you gon do
What you gon do
Strange Music

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
What you gon do (uhuh)
What you gon do (hah)
What you gon do (gon do)
What you gon do (hah)
What you gon do (gon do)
What you gon do (gon do)
What you what you
What you what you
What you gon do (gon do)

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
I bounce back with a BMG Track
From crocs pack to flashback
Hitter reigns next, I infiltrate
Cause we need next to flex
Invest the best, Invest cash check
Just wait for all the success
I'm an animal, I'm eating edibles
I'm at your ball, It's been a while
Bloody been a mile, Up in your maws
Boutta credit bout hit em hear em out
I been to crowd no minimal look around
Different layers of level exhausted
Destined for some greatness
But it not salted, gone spitter
Long hitter need a medic with a home with it
Strange axe nigga come fit it bone with it

[Verse 2: JL]
I've been grinding forever, I'm a diamond forever
Seek to my whip leather, She thinking my skin leather
The weekend I get wetter, Deep the mind trick clever
Trippin my drink wetter, Sleeping while we better
I been all tense since I was like ten
Sunday when and I was like when
Couldn't do this if I was like them
Niggas wouldn't blow if y'all was like when
We hear chances now they slim
Ain't no moors found in them men
Nothing wouldn't show up we did see the time, address, and directions on how to get in
This isn't for everybody
My flow is immortal and godly
I don't support everybody
I'm on that normal and molly
Ignoring the mami
You smoking some four twenty come find me
Capital loss and the violence will shake
And I been rolling in the gelato glue
Only burning with real hitters
And we only watching for what not to do
Yall must not like money
Not like eating, not like meeting
I like lobsters, I like reading
I've been peeping, ain't nobody like us
Big tigger type us
From the basement, from the places
Pull the trigger like Russ

[Outro: Stevie Stone]
What you gon do
What you gon do (gon do)
What you gon do (gon do)
What you gon do (hah)
What you gon do
What you what you
What you what you
What you gon do (gon do)
