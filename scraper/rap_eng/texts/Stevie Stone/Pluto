[Intro: Suli4Q]
Once upon a time
I Swore Up And Down
I had you figured out, yeah
Pluto
Took so many summers until you showed your true colors

[Hook: Suli4Q]
You ain't who I thought you was
Pluto, Pluto
Ohh, you ain't who I thought you was
Pluto, Pluto
Ohh, you ain't who I thought you was
Pluto

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Still remember when I first saw ya
I was broke down, you can call it that
Back to when the family introduced us
Said they knew that we would be a match
Shit I got up in the game and made an exchange
Fell off but shit bounced back
Was just a young'n didn't know the battle
And all the homies, they was dirty madness
You and I, we started gaining attraction
Doing it well to your satisfaction
And you was goin filling my head up
Telling me to get up and level up no more distraction
And in return I remain loyal
Thicker than soil I remain to
I thought it was love the first time I saw you
Was it a dream or was it living the proof
You fool me, shame on you
The big promise is never coming through
You had me thinking about it, hopped on the plane
Not living in vain, I'm bout to fly to you
No lights, no lights
Passport and got my ID
Put me close, I wanna see this first
Plane sight, to where my eyes can see

[Hook: Suli4Q]
Pluto, Pluto
Ohh, you ain't who I thought you was
Pluto, Pluto
Ohh, you ain't who I thought you was
Pluto, Pluto, Pluto, Pluto

[Verse 2: JL]
I was young, dumb, and amazing
You brought the cradle I was raised in
Yeah, we be gunners entertaining
I discovered what I want and never changed it
My days spent staring at a space out of fascination
With an untamed, un-tame imagination
I impatiently aimed, you see I was chasing
Your two faces, I can't seem to find a place, but
You had me on a short leash
I thought that I knew how you operated
If you told me to jump, I would've cooperated
Our relationship hit a slump and then it got complicated
Like a broken record to spin until I get nauseated
How I been, cause the fakin' I do not relate with
Hope we on the same page again soon, that's what I've awaited
[?] but they say that the clout is dated
Really I never wanted nothing but you though
A lot of my dreams is gone and I seen niggas here, they come and go
Teacher telling me "Have a backup plan", I was like "What's it for?"
When I was in love and lucky the preachers say that you with the soul
Everything they say when the wondering out the other one
I open another door if there is another skeleton
It may be the man I am, I managed to do the damage done
Reaching for the stars and landed on

[Outro: Suli4Q]
Pluto
Once upon a time
I saw up and down
I had you figured out, yeah
Pluto
Took so many summers until you showed your true colors
You ain't who I thought you was
Pluto
