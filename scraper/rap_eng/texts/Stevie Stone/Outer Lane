Whoooa whoooa
Riding down outer lane

(Verse 1: Stevie Stone)
Switching these lanes, forwardly progressed
Out here get a little bit of change, keep promoting this project
Meeting and greeting, I interpret the logic
Strategizing the formation results in some profit
Outer lane crucial, dips and curves can be wicked
Lead us to into temptation, lifestyle gets a little addictive
Time with the kids, writing these songs
Be home couple of weeks then next I’m gone

(Bridge)
It takes all of my mind, my time
My grind, it will provide, yeah, whoa

(Hook: Stevie Stone)
You can find me on the road
Don’t know when I’m coming back
Always on the go, touring away
I’m riding down outer lane (down outer lane)
Driving down outer lane (down outer lane)
Driving down outer lane (down outer lane)
Touring away
I’m riding down outer lane

(Verse 2)
Groupies and hoes, looking for dinner
Rockin these shows, gotta whole lot of frauds and pretenders
I am the mode, here's my message to sender
Drive up and do it with one hella prominent figure
I’m a dominant nigga, when I grab the mic and deliver
Married to music, now my life is surrendered
Missing my kids, one week till I’m home
Be home three weeks then next I'm gone

(Bridge)
It takes all of my mind, my time
My grind, it will provide, yeah, whoa

(Hook)
You can find me on the road
Don’t know when I’m coming back
Always on the go, touring away
I’m riding down outer lane (down outer lane)
Driving down outer lane (down outer lane)
Driving down outer lane (down outer lane)
Touring away
I'm riding down outer lane

Riding down Outer Lane [3x]
