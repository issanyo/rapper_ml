Bad habits
I got too many I can't even count it
Look at me I'm still styling
Burn some rubber on the ground and now I'm audi

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Trust issues
Some problems just gon' miss you
Two on the team, making me crush them holders
I don't know what it is, could be I'm barely sober
Intervention to make decisions I know better
Get tuition not vision I'm just a go-getter
Reminiscing vision homie my third eye scoping
Some bad habits in denial I'm hoping

[Pre-Hook: Navé Monjo]
This life is beautiful
I've made mistakes, I can't erase
Don't cross that line
It'll be alright
Right, right

[Verse 2: JL]
I feel the pressure but stressing it isn't worth the time
I'm blessed but the furthest thing from the perfect kind
Had to hit my side high now I'm back moving around
Sipping a Henny, smoking a cig, breaking a swisher down
The marijuana's temporarily changing how I felt
The pain is self-inflected, but if I complained did not help
Don't regret none of the decisions that I made myself
I played the hand I got delt

[Pre-Hook: Navé Monjo]
This life is beautiful
I've made mistakes, I can't erase
Don't cross that line
It'll be alright
Right, right

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
I got some issues I been thinking 'bout
Lately I ain't nothing to really sing about
I been hiding my face in places
Graduated from bottles to cases
Smoke a little I'm faded
Yeah, and suddenly I hate it
Yeah, we been celebrated
Feeling like I ain't made it
I got some bad habits to fix they in the mixes
Where my chick spits to Krizz
But I ain't really listen

[Pre-Hook: Navé Monjo]
This life is beautiful
I've made mistakes, I can't erase
Don't cross that line
It'll be alright
