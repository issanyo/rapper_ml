(Intro)

Hate, is a form of evil, a waste of an emotion
All my life ive been against the odds
So thou dont offend me, yea they intensely fuelin my fire
The rhythym and ryhmes that I quote, one of the realest that I ever wrote
(huh) and I will not stop
You gonna feel it, im a let it go, Im the realest that they ever wrote
(huh) and I will not stop

(Verse 1 )

Since the time that Stoney been spittin
Hes gifted with game, versitile, so the people listen
Not to mention the fame that it brang cause Stoney glisten
Hes causin friction
Theres moral to the story, everybody gotta pay attention
Im on a mission
Got my eyes up on the prize
Always gon keep it hunnit never catch me falsify
See others tryin mine, see they hatin in they eye
See Stoney on the rise, see gotta respect his grind
Stevie on the road, Stevie doin hella shows
Hangin with the big name, they say he bound to blow
Always on the boy yea they talk behind my back
And when I come to town, gossip get to commin back
I tell em "what, im back," but your talkin is nothin
Tell em stack up they paper, Ain't no future in frontin
On the buck and im bendin
Yes my flow is authentic
You witnessin the future, Im a fuckin lieutenant

(Chorus)

You can hate but you wastin your time
You can hate but you wastin your time
(man your wastin your time)
I know a lot of folk fake and they lie
You can hate but you wastin your time
(homie you wastin your time)
And theres a couple that'll hate on me
If it's up to them they'd turn the page on me
(man your wastin your time)
But you forgot that im a brave homie
Until they put me in the grave homie
(huh, your wastin your time)

(Verse 2)

This one here has kept you some feelins
Im speakin of circumstances, reminiscing the chillin
Some niggas is wishes that im floppin from the beginnin
Makes me a villain
What type of manager can't manage his own spendin
What type of homie gets salty when I ride to the ceilin
Camouflagin his feelin
Its an envious syndrome
Always makin somebody mad in this life that im livin
Is this how im perceived
All this hatins a givin
Im survivin the struggle
I can figure to fix ya
Haters fuel to my fire
Ive ignited the picture
Theres more stalkas who rip ya
Got a beautiful buzz
Analyzin the situation when im off in them nubs
Dont get it twisted when im ventin ya, its not a diss
Its a situation im facin yall when im copin wit
My pen and my pad for play I recorded it
Im a subordinate and haters im gettin bored of it

(chorus)
