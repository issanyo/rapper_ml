[Intro]
I know they will remember me, I'm headed for my destiny
I'm crying out it's meant to be, for me to write this legacy
I decided a long time ago that failure wasn't an option
Nobody said this road would be easy
You can't be scared to get knock down
Cuz you go be measured by how quickly you get up
We all in the same game, going for the same prize
Success, love, happiness

[Verse 1]
My life, you can love it or hate it
This ambition is had me breaking through when am waken
My world, said a loner be taken
So they turn and they leave a mark all up over di nation
Divine road, let the story be told
They would live a life up in front of my future unfold
I'm just walking this trod, try destiny taking control
Pull it up in his hands and go, happy on the road

[Chorus]
I'm on a road to win (yeah, yeah)
And in the morn, wake up start praying
Thank the Lord for another in
I'm on a road to win
Know exactly where am going and where I been

[Verse 2]
I know they will remember me, I'm headed for my destiny
I'm crying out it's meant to be, for me to write this legacy

Hah, these words, long living, headed for my destiny's all written
Eating words, God's giving, chiseled out my name that we all winning
Give the ship to carry on, this is God's children
Write my legacy and souring over tall buildings
Yeah, I'm tryna speak to every soul and pray for me when am on the go
Cuz I be on the road

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I know they will remember me, I'm headed for my destiny
