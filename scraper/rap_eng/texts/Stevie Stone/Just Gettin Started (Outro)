[Verse:]
Feels good to be home, it’s like I never left
Gotta take a minute to roll one over to homies
Gotta take a minute to holler out the beautiful women, on the down for they family
Had a pay homage to those who paved the way before me
Had a pay homage to the youngsters that I had fist fight with as a kid
Yeah, Yeah, I help make me who I am today
I ride through the mall to bend with my eyes low and wide open at the same time
Just seen a lot of places, seeing a lot of things, see this music
Tools, flights, shows, fans, I wouldn't trade it for the world
We don't took this same new thing all over, they love how we talk
The love what we stand for, and I stand for anyone who stands for me
You see, on track one, I said I was gonna start from the beginning
Now, here we on the last track and we still like the beginning
That’s cuz I’m just gettin' started, hear me?
