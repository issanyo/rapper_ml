[Hook: Stevie Stone]
They know what I'm bout
I go, run mouse
This stage is my house
Flip mode

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Ready, set, go, I been ready
All in it, dog then I let the stars get him
Gravitating through the surface hear ’em commenting
See I'm trying to make you nervous, have your palms sweaty
I be feeling like I'm noble, I’m not perfect, I'm not vegan
A savage, I see a salmon, I'm tryna eat it
A problem since 50 follows, I put my feet in it
Evolving became the mild one but 'tis the season
Trav told me to put the stank on it
He gon' put the bank on it
We won't even think on it
Let me demonstrate on it
I'ma infiltrate on it, dang Tony
Here's a damn, but what you take on it
I’m a veteran, Letterman
Never could be better then rappers competin’
Beheading 'em, I bat at ’em, instead of it
But bitches elephant's better than ever and relevant
They stiffin' weather, let pet 'em, the medicine
I’m heaven sent, ah!

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
They know what I'm 'bout
I go, run mouse
This stage is my house
Flip mode when I come 'round
(Stage killa)

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
I'm a stage killa, I'm a made nigga
Play with 'em, renegade niggas, I'm a daze nigga
Push play when the gaze hit
Had to shoot the fade with 'em
Rockin' with the motherfuckin' Grave Digga
Put me in motion, locked, and I'm on deck
Groomed by the block for them niggas who ain't know yet
I could sing a lullaby to the bitches goin' through the speakers
Got a speaker like "Stevie, I'm so wet" every town
Yep, said I'm on son
I got a cattle on the god I send along run
They went wild in the bleachers every time trying to meet us
They be wanting the Filet Mignon
You could tell 'em what we on

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
They know I'm bout
I go, run mouse (yeah, talk to 'em now)
This stage is my house
Flip mode when I come 'round
They know what I'm bout
I go, run mouse (yeah, talk to 'em now)
This stage is my house
Flip mode when I come 'round

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Ain't no party like a Tech N9ne party
Selling tickets when I spit to get the check, mine hardy
When I kick it, demons pick it, 'cause I bless mine's Maude
Gave the gift and I'ma lift it with the best rhymes, Audi
Instead of attention nigga, hence that I sent 'em
Was the mission not the vision is to rinse bad intentions
The sickened, come and get they meddy
When they ready, keepin' it heavy, get the fetti
Then we pop a couple Eddy's
If you deceitful and compete with us then you die nigga
In front of the people we come lethal when then it's bye niggas
Why niggas get adrenaline enough to try niggas
Get the pace, split the flame, it be like a fire lit us
I'm givin' 'em a domino effect
Meddling with honorable Tech
Vamanos, shouldn't wanna go at Don in front of folks
You're comical at best
Yeah, yeah, don't run now motherfucker
Hit the switches on you bitches
Put you down motherfucker, aye
My stage is my sanctuary
Ain't you scary, coming for that bank you carry
Why you hate me, because I violate he
They wanna try and grate ya die when I annihilate thee
You people say that you are such a vagina
For coming at me tough then I can bust your demeanor
You suckas be yelling "I had enough" when I sting ya
When it come to performing, you can't fuck with the N9na nigga

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
They know what I'm bout
I go, run mouse
This stage is my house
Flip mode when I come around
They know what I'm bout
I go, run mouse
This stage is my house
Flip mode when I come around
