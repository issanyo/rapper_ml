[Intro: Stevie Stone]
We was chokin' on that good, about a quarter past midnight
Bad body walkin' through the hood
Kaliko tell her what it feels like

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko (Stevie Stone)]
Now I'm getting all nervous cause I'm seeing something I like (Something I like, yeah!)
And I take anything, but I think she be fittin' me right
(She be fittin' me right, come on!)
Now I usually do chocolate but tonight I'm all white (Okay!)
And you know I be the one that got the drinks on ice, right!
(Heya! Heya!)

[Bridge]
Foreign girl where you come from (where you come from)
When they young young can I get some (can I get some)
Ready to run can we get DUMB (Dumb)
Are you the only one or is there any...

[Hook]
More [More] (x8)

[Interlude: Stevie Stone]
Huh, himme, drop everything and come with me

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko (Stevie Stone)]
Now I'm in a foreign land feeling right (Yo I'm feeling right)
And I'm a spend about a couple of bands before the end of the night (End of the night ya!)
We can go up on a Tuesday but it's like a Saturday night (Like a Saturday night ha!)
And I got them drinks on ice, right
(Heya! Heya!)

[Bridge]

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Let me tell you 'bout credit card, check, cash, more money than a gold digger could ever spend (AH-HA)
But I got deep pockets and short arms, so these "botches" can hold on cause they trickin if you got it to spend
So I'm a get up over yonder, overseas where they more fond of
Imma find dimes that I'm fond of
I'm lookin' for a spirit to conjure, when I be on ya then I'm behind ya, now
Now i can't use rubbers in the sauna, ganja will calm ya, the scent of it will bomb ya
Don't think that you're a hard little whore, cause I'm parched, not even, I mean
I'm starving for more gimme, I said I'm starving for more gimme

[Hook]

[Outro: Stevie Stone]
I wonder is there more like her 'round here is my mindframe
More, more
I be traveling alone in the fast lane looking I be searching
For more, for more
