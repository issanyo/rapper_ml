[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I remember when they used to point they fingers and laugh at me
Why? Cause I'm a Stranger
I remember when they never attended my shows and cursed my name
Why? Cause I'm a Stranger
Now! They pay me big money to do verses to do shows
Why? Cause I'm a Stranger
Now! I'm in every magazine accepting MTV awards or on all of ya billboards all over seas
Why? Cause I'm a Stranger!

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
It's the criminal the general the villain wow
I'm at the pinnacle and critical so hear me out
See I'm invincible and fin to blow so get ya chow
Spread my tentacles the friend and foe I'm reaching out
I'm tryin' to touch 'em, cause a ruckus, make 'em scream and shout
A gutter movement with my music's what I dream about
I want the Juggalos and niggaros to feel the crowd
One nation under a groove and all goin' wild
White kids walkin' and talkin' like D-boys
Black kids rockin' and moshin' at Strange noise
Gang bangers funkin' for nothing they feel the club
Red and blue gunners and thunders nothin' but love
That's my shit, that's the reason why I'm a Stranger
Nigga that's real spit, found a way to channel my anger
Hopin' it comes quick, for I'm back floatin' with danger
Back on some dumb shit, in the gutters hustlin' for paper
You feel me nigga? Yeah real spill nigga
(Music is my motherfuckin' savior you dig.)

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Stevie Stone!
Ruthless and strange connect game
Analyze him, doc's sayin' I'm insane
Vandalize 'em, I'mma fuck up your whole team on that 151 I'm flammable propane
Different mile different hoop different scoop
Got a short temper I'm more bearing the new (uh-hu)
MY head is manic I'm Fightin' tuggin' n' pullin'
And I seem to be a problem so worry 'bout what I'm doin'
Schizophrenic, Spasmatic, cause havoc
Three man giving them shit I'm maniac
Pumped, I'm ready to get it crackin'
On the front lines, stoppin' and traffickin' all your affections
Bloody Cal Cognito, Stevie Stone
I hate niggas, show resistance, we at yo door
Tame niggas, hurry quickly pick up the phone I'm gone, I'm in my zone, p'zone
But I get that call from a Stranger (Himmi Hyme!!)

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
It's that, murderous spit, that'll hit quick, and I'll change ya
This clique's full of danger
Killer misfits that'll bang ya, blame ya, anger
On the game if you can't maintain pain, ya gangsta
But ya brain can't hang flame came from a Stranger
It's that, murderous spit, that'll hit quick, and I'll change ya
This clique's full of danger
Killer misfits that'll bang ya, blame ya, anger
On the game if you can't maintain pain, ya gangsta
But ya brain can't hang flame came from a Stranger

[Bridge: Loki and Cognito]
Hey Cog
Yo whats up Lok?
Rally up the boys
What's up?
And get my duffel bag from the garage
Which bag you want me to grab?
You know the one
All right I gotcha
All right

[Verse 3: Loki]
Now look here when a faker's playin' undertaker
It comes to it and I will put you under acres
Some do it, clean as a whistle with a dirty weaponry
Throwing the 45 in to the river while doing 70
Fuck the party and revelry, I can hardly ever be less than the way of doing dirt
When the evil it feels so heavenly
Can you feel that? the sensation you get from the hash marks lacerations that mark another field cat
Now I'm murder nervous I got the killer jitters
Drummin' my fingers on the steerin' wheel
But then when it get real bad
I takes my whiskey straight from the chaser and kill that
I'm over it homie, why in the fuck would I even feel bad?
The raw deal's back
Pistol whip slick him with sweat, that hit to yo chest
I puts that shit down to rest, more sick than the rest (Bitch)
I'm in the practice of cutting off heads
So I can go and take a shit down your neck

[Verse 4: Kutt Calhoun]
Stranger... Yeah ahhh huh
I heard the word on the streets that the red one was gettin murky
Some niggas on the South Side of town is feelin' jerky
Losing weight and gainin' hate cause they pockets are really hurtin'
Wanna pull the shades down on the nigga and call it dirty
Not only that my nigga they knowin' the way you swervin'
They know about the deuce click alliance and how it's mergin'
With the click clack plan to bring emphasis to the surface
And get the word on you with the interest of bein' worried
NIGGA!!!
Bet I don't, homie its scurvy begin to tuckin' nigga
Bet I don't, have no remorse when you get the tuckin' nigga
Bet I won't, not when niggas be like me shoot it
Now I shoot it stand up and take a pee like me (bloods)
Spittin' through your toofas, I'm a modern Frank Lucas
So you can comprehend that this American gangsta
That slayed ya
All through the hoods like blue magic
Overdosed from my needles
Learned ya not to take packs from a Stranger
Hahahahah bitch ass niggas, Yeah

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
It's that, murderous spit, that'll hit quick, and I'll change ya
This clique's full of danger
Killer misfits that'll bang ya, blame ya, anger
On the game if you can't maintain pain, ya gangsta
But ya brain can't hang flame came from a Stranger
It's that, murderous spit, that'll hit quick, and I'll change ya
This clique's full of danger
Killer misfits that'll bang ya, blame ya, anger
On the game if you can't maintain pain, ya gangsta
But ya brain can't hang flame came from a Stranger

[Interlude: Tech N9ne]
We're every where you turn, you can't run from it, real shit always prevails
Cognito, tell these motherfuckers the fuckin' deal man

[Verse 5: Cognito]
Bandanas and night bandits with knife antics
Blood on a white canvas from innocent bystanders
When ya wife panics chrome nine drops in no time cops
Surround yo area searchin' a full nine blocks
Pull up my alias
Some times the laziest make for the meanest individuals stereo-typical
Plus he's known to be very invincible barely predictable
Buried a pistol drug erupt and carried the nympho carefully and slow
Back to reality here's the formality I'm sicker than last night
This ain't one two or three it's a fortality
That's the shit you do when tryin' to live on a poor salary
Battery criminal flattery steady pourin' out of me
Had to be drugs and alcohol naturally why you askin' me
Resolve both of 'em that's my problem your problems catchin' me
As soon as Kutt give me the signal im through your kitchen window
I'm creepin' and you in danger rearrange ya label me a Stranger

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Strange Music baby, me and Trav reapin' the benefits of all our blood, sweat and tears

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
It's that, murderous spit, that'll hit quick, and I'll change ya
This clique's full of danger
Killer misfits that'll bang ya, blame ya, anger
On the game if you can't maintain pain, ya gangsta
But ya brain can't hang flame came from a Stranger
It's that, murderous spit, that'll hit quick, and I'll change ya
This clique's full of danger
Killer misfits that'll bang ya, blame ya, anger
On the game if you can't maintain pain, ya gangsta
But ya brain can't hang flame came from a Stranger

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
When the smoke clears, nothin but the Snake & Bat will appear
