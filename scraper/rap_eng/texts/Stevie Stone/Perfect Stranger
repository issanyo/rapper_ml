I told 'em I'm a
[Hook 1]
Stranger, stranger
(So sit back, relax your mind)
Stranger, stranger
(Give you a piece of mind)
Stranger, stranger
(UUUHH HUH)
Stranger, stranger (Huh!)
Told 'em I'm a stranger
Some of them tried to hold me down
Other people said that I was crazy
Been working to get my feet off the ground
Now, I told 'em I'm a stranger
Yeah, I'm a stranger
Say, I'm the perfect stranger
Yeah I'm a stranger, now
Told 'em I'm a stranger

[Verse 1]
Now, you can look into my eyes
See a stranger in the flesh ain't no surprise
I was destined to it
And the fans knew it
And the fam knew it
That one day we would coincide
Make beautiful music
Now we off and climbing
Started at the fairgrounds and stars aligned
And perfect timing, eleven years later
Now together, rhyming
Really good feeling when the headlines read
Strange been Stoned
When they asked me how I feel, I said I'm finally home
Remember the day it came to me
The feeling I felt prepared to be
On K.O.D
All you strangers start embracing me
Rippin' every word you heard I say
Midwest 'splotion came to play
Everything happens for a reason
I can finally say

[Hook 2]
Told 'em I'm a stranger
Some of them tried to hold me down
Other people said that I was crazy
Been working to get my feet off the ground
Now, I told 'em I'm a stranger
Yeah, I'm a stranger
Say, I'm the perfect stranger
Yeah I'm a stranger, now
Told 'em I'm a stranger

[Verse 2]
Different place, different time
This point in my career in a different state of mind
And I, upon this ladder climb
Getting all these strangers side
Spit flame, they mark reply
In time, I rise
Destined I've envisioned the stardom
No status can justify ? if I got 'em
Coming from the very bottom
Took the strangers to spot 'em
No I won't be enforcing the game
That boys a problem, holla
Now, all you doubters can suck it easy
Plotting up on my downfall
Back when, didn't really believe me
(And can't none of you haters hold me
And I'm riding with my homies
You gon' have to get to know me
I'm a)

[Hook 2]
Told 'em I'm a stranger
Some of them tried to hold me down
Other people said that I was crazy
Been working to get my feet off the ground
Now, I told 'em I'm a stranger
Yeah, I'm a stranger
Say, I'm the perfect stranger
Yeah I'm a stranger, now
Told 'em I'm a stranger
