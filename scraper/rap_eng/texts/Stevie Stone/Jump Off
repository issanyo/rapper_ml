Midwest in the building

[Verse 1: Liquid Assassin]
When I get up on the mic I'ma show you how to put it down
Nothing to play
When I spit it like a beast in my verse and its full of rounds
Bussing em' straight
My names in front triggers, Krayzie boy
Used to recline niggas, Layzie boy
Bring it like a motherfucking man on a mission the way I spit it like it not tasty boy
I don't give a damn what a hater say
I stay silver and black like the Raiders play
Beam on down like laser tag
Cock back shoot that then I fade away
Talking and beginning that I got a little name that you motherfuckers hating and judging me
All because you niggas is wanting a little fame
Probably why you hating cause' you can't FUCK with me

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Jump off (x8)
See we gon' be the boss (x2)

[Verse 2: Kamikazi]
Well let me toast to the fortune, the fame
Never anybody go against the grain
Even if I gotta switch lanes, you can look into my eyes
You can tell a motherfucker don't play come around me
Bleep bleep with the shotty
And I ain't taking no names, I'm finna leave with the bodies
Cause I be demonic [?] cannibalism, kamikaze
Fuck a hater, better pack it up
Running up with the ? about to smack em up
I laugh at ya, got the nerve to back it up and off in Minnesota we taking the maximum
Don't make the mistake and jump off
Underneath the premises vacate, so fuck ya'll
Everyone in the vicinity my enemy
If you a hater you better raise the white flag boy, I'ma crush ya'll

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Jump off (x8)
See we gon' be the boss (x2)

[Verse 3: Dalima]
Dalima the master
Word ripper disaster
Murdering like a semi gat when I get 'atcha
You a beginner, so partner, you don't want the rapture
Off a nigga, so heat 'em ? Alaska
[?] when I rip
Anybody wanna battle Lima will die quick
So you don't wanna challenge a lyrical mind
Cause when it comes to attacking, my niggas all lions (spitta)
When I get off into with the flow every word will start to follow off the page
[?]
Dalima and alcohol is two plus two
[?] gotta be the new best crew

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Jump off (x8)
See we gon' be the boss (x2)

[Verse 4: D-Loc]
Young Loc on the grind, getting money all day
And I don't really give a fuck about what the haters say
I will run up on you busting all black with the Tec
Busting up outta the cover now heat 'em up with the flame
Schizophrenic, I'll make you panic
Coming to murder
And my automatic weapon a mothafucka will hurt ya
If you hating on my niggas I do you dirt in your purpose
I send the clay to the coroner
Burn 'em up and desert 'em
Niggas wanna hate up on a nigga
Like to give up on a spitta like a milla
Killing all the competition
If a nigga think he really fucking with me
Then this trigga, fill 'em up with the venom
Then I'll hit em up with this trigga
I'm a lyrical murdera
Have you ever heard of a killa the gilla like Adolf Hitler
Turning rappers into corpses, like a set of rigor mortis
Mothafucka, I'm a straight up killer

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Jump off (x8)
See we gon' be the boss (x2)
