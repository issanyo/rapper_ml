[Intro]
Just when you though it couldn't get no better
Stevie Stone, Ruthless
Gotta tell them niggas
Wait a minute
Put your camera on
Grab your ink pen
Turn the lights on
Wait a minute
Gotta tell them niggas

[Hook]
Wait a minute
Hold your horses Stevie Stone up in the town
Wait a minute
Give your boy the mic and I'mma shut it down
Wait a minute
Nah, never later I'mma do it now
Wait a minute
Seven years comin', I done walked some miles
Wait a minute
You can't rock and ridin' kinda boring beats
Wait a minute
Everybody boppin' all up in the street
Wait a minute
Heavy hittin' beatin' like a wildebeest
Wait a minute
Hear you talking, but you gotta show me
Wait a minute

[Verse 1]
Wait a minute
Ruthless got me in the game
I'mma get you understood
[?] fuck of what I'm sayin
Yeah I'm on some bity thangs
Watch it how you say my name
Whom just a little bit different
Gotta tell them niggas (wait a minute)
Wait a minute
Watch me put the swag on
Just to make it crystal clear
I'mma cut my jag on
Everythang up in my closet
Yeah, got the tag on it
Listenin' to Fonzarelli, Charlie Hustle flashin'
Smash 'em (smash 'em)
Turn it up a notch
Say my neck real chunky
So it make the people watch
And them red red monkeys
Cordinated with the top
So I'm cleaner than a muthafucker
Steppin' in a spot
I make 'em (wait a minute)
Wait a minute
Nope I ain't playin wit em
Run up on me if you want it

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute
Who the hell you think I am?
New kid comin' on
Beatin' like a marching band
Go ahead and tell your friends
Homie need to check ya man
Niggas actin' dumbfound
I'mma make 'em comprehend (Wait a minute)
Wait a minute
Peep it when I drill 'em (While I drill 'em)
I'mma get 'em mama [?]
Been across the border from the coast with the [?]
I was [?] by the block
And I was raised in the middle, holler (Wait a minute)
Wait a minute
Yeah, I got my shine on
Put me on a center stage
And I'mma blow the town up
Seem as if I'm in a rage
Critics better calm down
Open up the door now
Witnessin' the show down (wait a minute)
Wait a minute
Wha-wha-what the deal nigga?
Put her on some trainin' wheels
And let her ride my bicycle
Get her in the playin' field
She bobbin' for my popsicle
History up in a makin'
Climbin' up the charts nigga
