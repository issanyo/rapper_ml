[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Get to talking and the money get to piling
Yo, my name's Stevie Stone I'm the pilot
And my piece convo got the ring
One day I'mma own me an Island
I got goonies on deck, got a couple pit bulls that'll, pull motherfuckers be wildin'
But right now only talking about money
And you don't wanna see them niggas get violent
Yep, you better lay low
I go hard for a motherfucking peso
I'm putting money on the street and let it get beat
Crime over when I'm laying and my leg goes
Yep, and that's pay though
Shine this motherfucker, put your shades on
Time to give them something they can hate on
And I'mma be the motherfucking man
I'm a boss, like

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
I get the money and I put it on the table
But the income climbed, I'm a stranger
The type of money can't go up in a pocket
I was countin' niggas creeping up now I'm famous
Every time I turn around hear a buck nigga talking 'bout rats
Mo' fucker you [?]
Call me AK Stevie be the great
I told Trav' that I found us a bank, boss like

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
(Man, this shit's too fucking easy, man
When you a boss, you know you ain't really gotta do too much
I don't get tired)
Kevin Gates going, I'mma see your girl slanging lumber
Bread when the gang worldwide, money come in
Black and regal gang that go roll around the 7
Me and mine's up at the back
Steam raised for the summer
In that water, hold up you gon' need a life guard
Scuba team swimming, selling white hard
Braces, what was he thinking?
Meant to say shackles, walking they clanking
[?] with plankton
Pistol persuasive, going-out gangster
Wanna sit down with me? I can arrange it
Wesson in possession, my weapon is stainless
Lo' get it loaded while I'm getting loaded
Actavis acting up after I poured it
This is the game, I say what's the commotion?
When you a boss, you don't need no promotion

[Verse 4: Stevie Stone]
Better walk with a Boss Bitch
Never ever seen a nigga quite like this
One hand in the game, nigga, vice grip
Super crime, blowing loud in the cockpit
Boss Shit, going hard, nigga get cake
Teo, put the call in to Big Gates
Hang back, got to work and let him relay
Laid back, bossed up on real estate
Walk out like
