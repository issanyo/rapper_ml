Hey! One, two, three, spit it!
Together we are a powerful force as one mind, body and soul. Let no evil enter nor attempt to reduce us because of the beliefs we hold. And with this love combined with our strength we ward off pain and stress. Technician I am, wholeheartedly in life and in death
Fire!
