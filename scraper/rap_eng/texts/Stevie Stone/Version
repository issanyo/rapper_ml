[Intro]
Let me tell you bitches something (yo)
You bitches should be thankful (uh-huh)
Look you bitches should be thankful you got somebody like me to point your finger at

[Verse 1: Info Gates]
It's safe to say your boy is bugging till he breathless
I'm puzzled how they ain't second-guessing these press kits
I'm out the loop and I ain't hip to what the trends is
I been depressed, desperate, reckless, yada yada
Now I'm checking my percentages, I said it, I meant it
I ain't the type of dude to make a mess and dip like F it
I ain't did it, I ain't taking credit
I ain't never took a piss and called it Manischewitz
You ain't even gotta stick your pinky and tell me it's dope
Got 'em writing polar name even smelling the smoke
On my mama, I'ma drop this, drop a knowledge on that noggin' (noggin')
Not gonna negotiate, it's not an option, yo what's up with Info
Why he always peeking out the window
He paranoid like he moving cane like we did Lorenzo
They wanna jump in my lane, just to move slowly
Shit they pull is too phony
Bitch I'm Bullet-Tooth Tony, look

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Just let me vibe with the beat
I'm not one of your ordinary, you ain't liver than me
They saying that I'm one of a kind and I would agree
You ain't never ever see a better version of me, look

[Verse 2: Info Gates]
I keep a poker face on some Gaga shit
But should've been had a Billy with this blah blah shit
My people tell me Gates you know that you ill
So I get it crackin' no frackin' the fuck is a drill
It's still scenes, they spilled beans
All I need is a lil green, nicotine, and 15 minutes
Kill Bill scene the dream, come in confident
Slobbering all on the mic so y'all should probably not commence
Rapping after me I'm not convinced they wanna see us
Copping compliments and popping up
From prog to providence and rocking shit
I ain't never thought them dudes was optimist
Obnoxious bitches opposite's of Gates
It's awkwardness when I'm around 'em
I found 'em giving a fuck less
Lately I'm less lazy but still probably never gon' change
I'm so KC, the left of land and split your lips
So I'm secure enough to see Mariah drivin' in the whip
Bitch

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Just let me vibe with the beat
I'm not one of your ordinary, you ain't liver than me
They saying that I'm one of a kind and I would agree
You ain't never ever see a better version of me, look (look)

[Bridge: Stevie Stone]
You see your mind's in the gutter
I'ma live in the moment
I'm getting straight to the butter
Getting straight to the bread
Getting straight to the cake
Best version of Stone

[Verse 3: Info Gates]
Best version of Gates
So save your breath will all the comparisons
Telling me who I remind you of
All that arrogant shit's embarrassing
I got the key and I build with Samaritans
And if Keke don't love me
I take her friend to the Sheraton, I ain't tripping off it
Hop in the whipper-snapper
With the paint dripping off it
I'm raw dog, I never whip the wrapper off the rubber
Muscle chest, Himmi Hyme
Combined bread and butter
Nap time no bed and cover
Mother-
