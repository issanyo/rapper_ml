[Hook: Wrekonize]
Livin' my life under a blacklight
Out here paying my dues
Sometimes I lose it and don't act right
Feelin' forever new
Livin' my life under a blacklight
Out here paying my dues
Sometimes I lose it and don't act right
Feelin' forever new
Feelin' forever new

[Bridge: Bernz]
Another night, another song
Another message, another wrong
Another chain too hard to break, I carry on
The weekday war is hard, but I love gettin' down til there's blood in my palms

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Faith in the wrong, acein' them all
Traveling down to get the better set or stake in them all
I'mma live fast, steady breakin' the laws
Tell em to get a grip and let me chase the applause
Nightlight on the tight like the dynamite, got 'em like
"Man, these some all time lifers."
We hype bout it the mic right
But what can we say to help us to burn brighter
Go pro so, so long
Pick it up until the dark, like sonar
Pen 'em and still I'm on the meal to the bogarts
So far we broke off the sonar, they so lost
And I'm here for my birth right, counseling
One too many in the back of my mind
Think too much about my life then I found it
To make me want to jump back in the line
This one is just another nightlife song
Come on home and turn the nightlights on
Waitin' for the sun to rise and I'm not nine to five lies all died in the mornin'
Fives up for the restart, sunset, countdown, get ready, go
Forever new, we can't reload

[Hook]

[Bridge: Bernz]
Sometimes I feel like this in my blood, you know?
Some of my earliest memories is
Wakin' up once a week
And hearin' the party goin' on downstairs

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Black lights, white lines, high times, red eyes
Clean whips, dirty minds, bad girls, new designs
Tough city, tougher life
Callin' death, soul on ice
Chest burnin' but it feel nice
Sneakin' not to seek out the night
And I'm sorry ma
Cause the downtown lights are never off
Hypnotized by the evening demons
Feel the neon lights are turned on
Hear the DJ rotate my song
Never thought set would break a dawn
Feelin' like modern day out-laws
Getting paid well for singing our songs
Praise the Lord, thank the stars
In tape we trust, rush the music cards
Watch us work hard and earn that rent
Tryin' to make that boy blow his whole paycheck
And I feel at home with the freaks and wierdos
In the club surrounded by people
Some are scared to say that we're evil
But it's cool

[Hook]

[Bridge: Stevie Stone]
These are the days of the road (traveling at night)
Spread my wings as I ease through the door (I reside under this blacklight)

[Verse 3: Stevie Stone]
Wake up, whole new city, gotta shake up
Time takes up
Bout ten shows to get the kinks out
We bake out then we drink up
We go hard to get cake up
Caution sign, this tape up
Down around about an hour to drive
I got a limited time I get it dranked up
When I'm fucked up I don't act right
Temptation, I just might
Hard to fight when she is the type to be actin' out at those black lights
But I'm leaving now, ready tomorrow, twice a year and I'm comin' back
Sinister Avenue, lovin' the party
Keepin' it low with no strings attached
(I'm livin') Livin' every day like my last
(I'm livin') All work, no play, no rest
(I'm givin') Givin' every little bit a part of me
(I'm givin') Last time for me to go and last breath
(Yeah) Forever my journey, message suggests
100 dog on top lets rep YEP

[Outro]
Livin my life under a blacklight
