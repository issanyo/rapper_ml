She my boo thing…
Shawty lookin so fly i keep her by my side
Cause she my boo thing
Got these hater mad caus they know they can'y have
My Boo thing
When night goes down you know i’ll be around
My Boo thing
My Booo Thiiing

{Verse 1}
Yeah……your body’s so vicious
Violate your curves all night that’s my mission
And I know you get mad when you crave for my attention
When i’m home up off the road everyday thanksgiving
Type of women to show you ever day that she a rider
Any circumstances she my Bonnie i’m her Clyde
Ain’t no creeping on the side and the feelings can’t hide
Got some jealous tendencies but we let the shit slide
Overcame a lot of bullshit that we’ve been through
Lets you waltz down love drawn it continues
Knowing that you mine when you grind and i’m in you
This is how i feel (how i feel) when i’m near you…

{Verse 2}
Uh now its round two climb on top don’t stop shawty clown too
Got an angel that surrounds you
And you been a blessing since the first day I found you
And I’ve been waiting for a minute
A fine red bone creeped up got me stuck all in it
The homies said i’m winning
At late nights talking bout building
A fence first start at the begging
We got our stubborn ways opposites attract
She love my ambition how I travel through the map
I love her intuition and the way she threw it back
I ain’t even trying to brag i’m just laying out the facts……

{Bridge:Darrein}
Baby you're so beautiful
And I know, that I never felt like this before
I'm so in love, yeah yeah
Just bounce with me baby
Bounce with me baby(X5)
(Bounce for me)
(It feels good don't it uh)
You know you're my special girl
You're my boo thing
