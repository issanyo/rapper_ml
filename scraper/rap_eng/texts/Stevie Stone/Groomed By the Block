[Intro]
Boys in the hood
Boys in the hood

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Got two in the front as I roll through the trap
Blunts rolling em up, shit pouring the Yak
I don't fuck with these niggas you better learn and adapt
Start calling it raps, told my bitch to run it back
Buss it on a nigga, got her coming back
Shit, racks on the table, I can send a pack
Wide receiver, wide receiver, who the quarterback
Better check my zodiac
I done came up out the house, couldn't give a fuck bout a total
If I see you, I don't fuck with you, gon' act I don't know you
Got some niggas in the city tryna figure me out
If it ain't about no paper, ain't no figurin' it out
Said I hear your rumors
Talking "Stevie lost some money on the last tour"
I can show you how to bounce it back, bitch I'm manure
Pussy nigga mind your business I'm a connoisseur
Better check my monitor

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Had it all from the dirt
I was groomed by the block
Could put your face on a shirt
I was groomed by the block
Started putting in work
Bitch I was groomed by the block
Had my hand in the pot
We was getting that guop
I was groomed by the block
I was groomed by the block
Bitch I was groomed by the block
I was groomed by the block
I was groomed by the block
I was groomed by the block
Had my hand in the pot
Started getting the guop

[Verse 2: JL]
Just a kid from the block, never what I was not
Not a thug, I was shot, fell in love with the chop
I'ma pride for the op, silent Bob to a cop
Free my niggas on lock
Randall LT burg west crook and wop the clip in the steel
Don't look like it's your bih, give em 60 to split
Cripple six in your clique, hit nickel sex with it zip
Blowin big with a blood and i just hit a lick with a crip
Don't leave a print when you got a glove
I got love for the one to be tuned in
Didn't get two cent it was too thin
Two tied up into a tube bin
Threw two for the one to just move in
Too real to quit when it true win
Think back to the time on a two tin
Ride with two bad bitches in a whip
Thinking damn two bad bitches ain't shit
Half 'em can't sit still for two seconds
Maybe too slow to catch us
Maybe too slow to get this
You know they go through directions
These hoes too nosy too reckless
Run out of weapons when sexin'
Keep your two cents and suggestions (swerve)
Too lit with a nigga watch what i do with it

[Verse 3: PHresher]
Nigga like me straight from the gutter
Repping Blake Ave and Sutter, don't get popped like some corn
My niggas don't play with that butter
I ain't never been bitch, word to my grandaddy mother
Sergeant crazy on wax, run up on em st-st-st-stutter
Tell me who you better than (better than)
I don't fuck around nigga I'm celibate (I'm celibate)
If it ain't bout no money it's irrelevant (it's irrelevant)
Hit the gas why you mad you still peddlin' (fuckin' peddlin')
I'm so sick of all these haters (are you)
I'm from the land of surprise
Full of backstabbers and knives
Some of my niggas didn't make it, I'm so happy to be alive
It's about how big is your heart, not about your physical size
Swear to sell nothing but the truth, won't tell now one single lie
Daddy said let me see where you stay
Tell me you get what you pay, if you want time you too late
Never try to bank karma good day, all about them chips Frito Lay
Only time you ball is 2K
Yeah my mom so sour for commas ain't no astronomical way
