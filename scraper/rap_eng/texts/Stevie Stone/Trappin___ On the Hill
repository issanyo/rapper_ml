[Intro]
Fire

[Hook: Stevie Stone]:
Way before a deal (trap, trap, trap, trap)
Trappin' on the hill (trap, trap, trap, trap)
Me and the homies we was mobbing out (we was mobbing nigga)
Slowly getting poppin now
Niggas wanna beef and entertain
Ran into an op to get to bang it
Way before a deal (trap, trap, trap, trap)
Trappin' on the hill (trap, trap, trap, trap)

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
I remember when that shits be young and coming up
Hop up off that porch quick
Had a plot to run it up
Did my dirt all by my lonely, very few that I can trust
Nowadays niggas telling all these headphones its a wrap
It was big big chat and savage
We was broke and didn't have it
We just knew we had some cabbage on the way
Pull an all-nighter it was all about survival
Had to bring back some of the cake to animate
(what you do?)
I took my talents to the street and got it wavy (lax)
Gotta coordinate and shit and made it pay me
I gave a fuck about a hater
It was all about the paper
Pussy nigga there will be no more debating me
Boss out

[Hook: Stevie Stone]:
Way before a deal (trap, trap, trap, trap)
Trappin' on the hill (trap, trap, trap, trap)
Me and the homies we was mobbing out (we was mobbing nigga)
Slowly getting poppin now
Niggas wanna beef entertaining
Ran into an op to get to bang it
Way before a deal (trap, trap, trap, trap)
Trappin' on the hill (trap, trap, trap, trap)

[Verse 2: JL]
Bred to become soldiers
Taught that way that's all I know
Ain't no head on these young shoulders
My hood play to buy the rope
I chose guns over controllers
The game you cannot control
Think ahead and keep composure
Either you in the frontline or the front row
Controller you tweaking
Yall don't even know the half
Fuck is you thinking
Give me any reason
Ill be a sav
Shit is uneven I do the math
Feel its the season to seize the bag
Saying that we question actually after my stag
Really ain't two to remove my bag
Still do you bad nigga too bad
Back to the bone marrow
I'm crack bad Michael Jackson bad Castro Jack Sparrow
Slash Ferrel flashback bandits
And smashing for that gear though
Every bad gets zero
Black Benz then a mask in to snatch cash here though
Motherfucker
