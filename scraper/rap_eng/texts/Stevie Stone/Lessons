[Intro: Jeff James]
Yeah, Yeah

[Hook: Jeff James]
I done came to far just to fall off
When they hating I'm working say they caught off
You cross a boss then it's your loss
You cross a boss then it's your loss
I get my thanks, I count my blessings
I took my Ls, I learned my lessons
You cross a boss then it's your loss
You cross a boss then it's your loss

[Verse 1: JL]
Absolutely
Following bands like a groupie
My hand's in the pot on the toolie
Don't hate if you not gonna shoot me
I make the plot of the movie we tape, but the Devil done try to recruit me
You must've forgot if you knew me, don't trust information you got from a goofie
Truthfully dumb, I'm on your head, you take an L automatically
I be the plug but that mean you dead like a cell phone battery
I got a failure allergy, I can tell you're mad
Oh well, my nigga you did that to yourself, you're bad
I been played, I played my part and learned
Come to far as far as I'm concerned
Went too far if I do not return
I been robbed, I been shot at, burned
Pocket rockets stop it occurrence
Pop if we do not agree to terms
Who or what is still to be decided but to keep your spot you gotta keep it durst
Let go
If you really bout it I can tell though
Don't need to be the Popper that are well known
But I know you heated when you hotter than a hell-hole
Shit for real bro
With the bread and nigga i dont wanna sell dough
Dont repeat it nigga had to make a wicked amount of money and still up in the court with an elbow

[Hook: Jeff James]
I done came to far just to fall off
When they hating I'm working say they caught off
You cross a boss then it's your loss
You cross a boss then it's your loss
I get my thanks, I count my blessings
I took my Ls, I learned my lessons
You cross a boss then it's your loss
You cross a boss then it's your loss

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Had a minor setback, bosses never take a loss
We just chalk it up and walk, bitch I'm never falling off
Put that on my partner Ski, I'm a veteran as long
You can ask the N9na about, my artillery and cough
Wise words being quoted, little tease he wrote it
Asked me to demote it, ladies envy they motors
Prophecies I'm golden, balancing and I'm voted
Frenemies turned enemies
You be boatload with that energy
And ima go and call the bottom
Yeah I'm almost famous, alot of clout though
You can ask rutabaga, I got a pot boiling
And here's the rule breaker
A lot of ship jumping and we don't do the faking
Lost B when you crossed me, I advise you for you to not do
Reality be a capital T
You be mad at me but we all through
Bout to blow and do it, had it all he blew it
Peep the shifty movements, bitch we out here grooving
What it is my nigga

[Hook: Jeff James]

You cross a boss then it's your loss
You cross a boss then it's your loss
I get my thanks, I count my blessings
I took my Ls, I learned my lessons
You cross a boss then it's your loss
You cross a boss then it's your loss
