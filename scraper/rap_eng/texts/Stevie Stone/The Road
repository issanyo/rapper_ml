[Intro - Stevie Stone]
This song goes out to all my brothers
That went out on the All 6's and 7's tour
(When we travel the road)
We was bonded together
We reached some of our highest highs
And our lowest lows
When we...
(When we travel the road)
MJ forever

[Hook - Stevie Stone]
When we travel the road
Livin' our dreams
Through the highs and the lows
When we travel the road
I'll cherish these things
And the memories I'll hold

[1st Verse - Stevie Stone]
Yeah
As I traveled the road
The road is the life
Microphone bright lights
Different town e'ry night
Havin' time outta bounds
Violently came to light
No real explanation, reality bites
Through the highs and the lows
We'll continue to fight
Have to cope with one of our brothers
And losing his life
Life is the road and my vision is clearer
Reminiscing about Michael Jones
As I look in the mirror
Thinkin' about ya
And I know that you hear me
Gone in the flesh, but I feel you in spirit
We be ridin' together
You forgotten we'll never (we'll never)
Reppin' MJ forever

[Hook]

[2nd Verse - Magnum PI]
Highs and the lows
I might die in approach
Of what I feel is a need
To be on top in the rope
Eyes wide, do this professional
I hope that regression don't
Put me out of pocket like that no more
Man the nerve of this bitch
Take everything that you workin' to get
Put all 'em blessings around 'em within
Take everybody from round you again, and again, and again
I know that you see that they want me to win
I know that you love me but than it depends
On how much I love this, groupies and budgets
Back on the road, but without my brother
Without my friend, he was another
MJ dead, Dad's in a coma, Maylene had passed
I was in motion, but fuck it!
So is this what I get for believing in dreams?
What Momma give for believing in king
TDE, Strange believe in the team

[Hook]

[3rd Verse - Wrekonize]
Road life, Mad Maxin' it
Pullin' the summer stunts
And tryin' not to fall into the Devil's hand
Which smothers us
I woke up late a couple months
Thought I saw my brother once
Some of us still dream to bleed revenge
Out of those fuckin' punks
My home is temporary
My smiles are soaked in whiskey sour
Bring the betty tell it let me
Better get me in the back
Up in the medley in a half an hour
Fightin' to get your shower
But I gotta get back to stage
Which is where I draw my power
To get the best in the last of days
This music's very Strange
Seems like a family thing
Movin' around the usual towns
Aluminum sound
I'm gonna get a Master's grade
I'm heading back today
I'm getting back to pay
Home seems to fade away
The road's a crazy place

[Hook]

[4th Verse - Bernz]
At first nobody's
Tryna be the life of that party
When I live a life that's so MÃ¶tley
Got a dream that's beyond me
Hit the road, like it hit me first
Like a muthafucka got that thirst
Cause I've got these things
I've got to do, before January 1st
Gotta do it for the fallen sensai's
Gotta do it for the man named MJ
When I do it, I'mma do it like it's summer
When I do it, cause I've got one chance to get this
Heaven knows my darkest lessons
No need for retrogression
Take heed from all the MC's
Tryna feed you hidden messages
Payment for the aimless
Live fast, stay young and nameless
Hopin' these fans can save us
Cause my shit's so we all famous
When a team that's Stone
I'mma call home where ever I go
Don't use the phone
I'mma see you when I get back home from the road

[Hook X2]
