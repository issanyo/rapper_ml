(Just me and indigo)
Riding slow, shotgun me and indigo
Got me in a trance, in my highs and lows
Wait a minute, I hope ya got 3 rolled
If you do just tell me now

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Just me and Indigo now, blaze with me
You I know we like to get high, blaze with me
You know I like to go, Doc said I can't smoke
But I like how it feel, when I'm off that dro
It's me and Indigo now, blaze with me
Just me and Indigo now, blaze with me

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Indigo, Yeah that's my girlfriend
Light us up, blaze it for my girl and
She talkin' loud (...)
