Celebratin', sippin'
You be praying that I grow up out commission
Yeah I know I hit a nerve right (right)
'Cause it's you that I'm talkin' about (you)
You be lookin' at me strange as I'm walkin' out
I'm grinding, no time to understand what the talks about
The line around the corner, another show
I be guapin' out (guapin' out)
So we just different breed (breed)
Instead of trying to build alliance you just envy me (me)
I'm in a league of my own
I'ma keep gettin' better
Got my foot pressed down on the pedal
A whole 'nother level

[Verse 2]
A whole 'nother level
Attract these ads (yeah)

Got my foot pressed down on the pedal
A whole 'nother level
