[Verse 1: Mackenzie Nicole]
You shouldn't take it lightly
When you see me eyeing you
Like I wanna see you lying
Beside me watching every breath
Yeah, you love me to death
It's sad it's what you said
Oh, I know you
So what you wanna do
Knowing fully that I can't waste time
Now before you change your mind

[Hook: Mackenzie Nicole]
It's mine for the taking
I just wanna take you down
Been so much time in the making
I can feel you giving now
I can feel you, oh oh, oh oh oh
I can feel you, oh oh, oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Ryan Bradley]
Brushing over your lips
Girl I can't control this
You know it's hard for me to be alone
Everything you said keeps running through my head
No hesitation, don't keep me waiting
Cause you know I'm barely hanging on
Take my love, take all my love until it's gone

[Hook: Ryan Bradley & (Mackenzie Nicole)]
It's mine for the taking
I just wanna take you down
Been so much time in the making
I can feel you giving now
I can feel you (oh oh, oh oh oh)
I can feel you (oh oh, oh oh oh)

[Verse 3: Stevie Stone]
Yeah, one touch, one scent, all it takes to have me convinced
Think about you when I'm not around you
Who would have thought it would have came to this
Cause you mine now, any time now
I'm gonna lie now cause it's making sense
And when I see you smile there's no mistaking this
So what do we do, feed to
Eye to eye you can read through
Sell the world we can breach through
My intentions just to please you
And it's fading now, no wait
Same way for me, navigate
End the line this love statement
This all mine so I got to take it

[Hook: Mackenzie Nicole]
It's mine for the taking
Been so much time in the making
It's mine for the taking
I just wanna take you down
Been so much time in the making
I can feel you giving now
I can feel you, oh oh, oh oh oh
I can feel you, oh oh, oh oh oh
It's mine for the taking
I just wanna take you down
Been so much time in the making
I can feel you giving now

[Outro: Ryan Bradley]
Oh I can feel you
I can feel you
I can feel you
