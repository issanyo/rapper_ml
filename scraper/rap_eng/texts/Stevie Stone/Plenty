[Hook: Stevie Stone & Ubiquitous]
She told me that she new to the city
She got a couple friends, not many
Where the lime and the Sprite and the Henny?
Wanna smoke lil' mama? Got plenty like
Pick a strain, whatever you want you can get
Indica, Sativa, never rolling plain jane
I know some people if you wanna drive 50
We ain't gonna cop any cause lil' mama got plenty

[Verse 1: Ubiquitous]
So many strains, nothing but flame, puffing the dro
One for the brain, one for the body, one for the soul
Running with Strange, keeping the party under control
Up, up away flying, how far are we gonna go?
Smoke team in the building
Godemis, what the deal is?
Wrek and Nonms coming with Bernz, Felix we're filming
County boy got the liquor
Casa was on a fader
Stevie came with the greenery, mixing multiple flavors
Whatever you want, homie
Tell me when to say when
How 'bout you and your friends come get with me and my friends
And keep it real with me, girl, I don't want to pretend
Like this is a new thing, cause really this' what it's been like
(Yeah!)

[Hook: Stevie Stone & Ubiquitous]
She told me that she new to the city

Pick a strain, whatever you want you can get
Indica, Sativa, never rolling plain jane
I know some people if you wanna drive 50
We ain't gonna cop any cause lil' mama got plenty

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Over the top, coming and going
They ain't ho-ing, goody-goody pooty tang you ain't even knowing
Handle the biat, bad little biat
B, I ain't slangin' the D alright? You should do the D-I-Y
Well, leave it up to me, I'll try
Tight Levi's and knee-highs that leave us dry
I never seen a latina [?] well I mean like that
Nina, Nina [?]
Pass it around, like we taking tokes in a cypher
Been smoking since I was 2, so that mean I'm a life-er
Nothing I'm saying's true, that don't mean I don't like her
I mean Mary Jane's cool, that don't mean I'm gonna wife her
But she told me

[Hook: Stevie Stone & Ubiquitous]

[Verse 3: Godemis]
Way too wavy, radio don't play me
I don't mind y'all praying but it ain't gon' save me
I was going crazy then I bounced right back
Now I'm porno hard and Y'all can sit on that
Tell that lil' bitch I got money, ain't nothing funny
And regardless of the internet rumors I'm not a dummy
She bust it over for money, me Godi without a penny
We blowing that Strange mullah, who knew I was getting plenty?
Got the Sprite in the Henny, a right to be holding semi-
Automatic weapons, if and you [?]
Said she new to the city, we helpin' her live it up
There really ain't nothing to it, just let her know when to duck like
Fuck!
