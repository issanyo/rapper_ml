[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
My lyrics are closed captioned, dripped before the easy today
Open your eyes and you can witness every lyric, display
Half of what you hear is false, and what you see is the making of the truth, written in brail
So you can feel what I'm sayin', given niggas the holy spirit when I'm speakin' in tongue
With the truth in the [?] store, you were reachin' the young
And teaching the dumb how to smarten up their raps, and become, a better lyricist
Most of these niggers rapping is bums
Go and look for some confidence
Then you search for desire, passion and heart
Subsequently, the will to inspire
Subject matter, relatable topic you can convert
Into words for everyone
And maybe you'll imerge up to this new level

[Verse 2: Eyedos (Jynx Inc)]
We on that new level
I'm the boss to beat
The only time y'all flossing is between your teeth
Go and get your two cents
Cause talk is cheap
No matter how high I'm above your peak (hovering)
Ain't nobody in my way gonna stop me
Handicapped match vs Apollo and Rocky
Y'all come sloppy like [?] Joints
Flexing all tough when you're as fake as roids

[Verse 3: Ruffnek (Jynx Inc)]
We on the next level, making noise
Top floor apartment, with a few rebel baby boys
When we cooking cheap
It's what we push on the streets
Mc's pounding the beat
Like heavy-footed police
I get in with the pussy [?] weak
So I tore it up
[?] So accept I never wore a glove

[Verse 6: Thommy Nekro the Solanum]
Hell bent, but i'm heavenly gifted
In Houston, Texas, My spit remains the sickest
From the time i arrived there, Ya got 2 wishes left
Got that, flow like asthma, I be takin' your breath
Thommy Nekro, the Solanum, Don't act like you ain't heard of me
My boys be devilish, Burnin beats to the worst degree
Anyone stoppin' my faction, straight absurdity
Grab harder than the grapple and your girlfriends 30[?] division
2 4 5, we sir runnin the loan store, we way ahead of the geese, like a horricore loan store
The king is here, so put you rookies in check, so when i come around, bow down, and gimme respect
Or i can sever their neck, and watch it spew like a fountain
I'm stackin Simpsons in a bottom like I'm king of the mountain
Fuck a label outta me like a trick, i did it with Adams
[?] the Solanum

[Verse 7: Rysk]
Midwest monster, fresh to death
Master level, after level, yes on to the next
They call me father, [?] titan when they come to confess
Next step, correct, for i do not bless, any weak rhymes
These lames are locked, and i walk up to a new land, Millennium Falcon
One rap at a time, i invade your home
I'm a rappin' in this heat, and like that, the tough realm
Wheres it's rappin and percisin', like a [?gab?] to the dome
It's lyrical  chrome, i never gotta reload
Spittin full metal jackets, got me splatterin brains
Steppin' to my new level, you're either stupid or brave
So please take note of this, yeti, grey ape shit
I'm loosened and mysterious
So when i [?] own [?bricks?]


[Verse 8: Dannibal Lecter]
Let it be known, that i don't want no part of your war
Better leave me alone, or i'll blow you away
Wickedness bled from the industry's head
See em, infection spreads and slowly becomes a play
Revolution is near, Mr. Washington's here, better get this shit clear, we're here to save the day
Man the battle stations, it's a war between the nations
Bring about the combination, of the sacrifices we made
We crushin the competition, give em the best of our position
And exposed from the contradiction, that the media portrayed
With a sense of mass destruction, i could target the swag and function, cause a dramatic disruption, break the bonds of a slave

[Verse 10: Stabes]
Rippin' dope flows and quotes by the level store
Real types spitting with a hard hitting metaphor
Smokin up blunts at the front of the liquor store
Music that will make your head nod till the [?line of the gore?]
But I ain't never been rappin' a grinch
Roll hard till i die, i'm destined to spit
I was brought up by kings who hustled the street
When it comes to lyrics [?] never compete
Real shit, My ink flows strong like a tidal wave
Never skipped a needle when it's time to let the record play
Most rappers doubt they stop putting in the page
Pack their bags up and then go and hit the highway
Can't fuck with KD, Calhoun, and gorillas stays
We that real shit, that these suckers tryin to imitate
Heavy bastards could never like a feather weight
We'll leave the whole scene, shook en like an Earthquake

[Verse 11: Rotten Robbie]
Hey! I'm Rotten Robbie!, and I'm on a new level
[?] crackin' on my shelf, when i'm digging up a body! Yes i'm Rotten Robbie!
And i'm with a motherfuckin' dead bitch, Don't beef, you will die
[?] so I'm on a different level, with some J's and a new double G
You should know me! You should see, Rotten Robbie, is what they call me!
So i'mma shut this bitch down, [?]
