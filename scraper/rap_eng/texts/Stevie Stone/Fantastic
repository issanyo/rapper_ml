I've got a lot to say but words are getting old
As the seasons change and my future folds
I can't bring myself to celebrate the new year
And every year becomes who I've always feared

And I just gotta know
Cause one thing's for sure

I can't imagine fast enough to settle on a dream
But I've spent this winter wondering when they're gonna settle on me
And there's some things I've just gotta know
But one thing's for sure

And I can't wait to go outside
And spend my summers contemplating what I'm gonna do with my life
And I still don't know
And I looked but I can't pretend
And I think and I think and I think about the end
And how I know, I know it's coming soon

And I just gotta know
Cause one thing's for sure

I can't imagine fast enough to settle on a dream
But I've spent this winter wondering when they're gonna settle on me
And there's some things I've just gotta know
But one thing's for sure

And I can't wait to go outside
And spend my summers contemplating what I'm gonna do with my life
And I still don't know
And I looked but I can't pretend
And I think and I think and I think about the end
And how I know, I know it's coming soon

And I just gotta know
Cause one thing's for sure

I can't imagine fast enough to settle on a dream
But I've spent this winter wondering when they're gonna settle on me
And there's some things I've just gotta know
But one thing's for sure
But one thing's for sure
But one thing's for sure
But one thing's for sure
