[Intro]
Uh-huh
This what you been waiting for, okay
Hmmmm, yup
Uh-huh

[Verse]
Yep, said it's lunchtime
Got the beat and hopped up in the front line
Propped my feet, and may throw a couple punchlines
Actively, we droppin' this in no time, ugh (EAT)
All heat, I bring no fillers
All meat, time to eat, the fam go wit' 'em
Pause me, run it back, this Rambo nigga
Taughty, I'm strapped with ammo, get 'em
Spit flame, my shell don' drop rage
And never been afraid to bail out high
Played and will demonstrate a rare on [?]
Caged up, a renegade, I stays real hots, nigga
Eat the least [?]
Peep the technique, heat, the beat gon' knock
Street-for-street passing fleet of equinox
Foley don't find a key, nigga, to get that box
(HIMMI)
Talk breezy, is easy, the game need me
Pre-order for order, nigga, it need be
I'm instructed to give you niggas a freebie
You can call this assemble a little teasey
Contrary to what another nigga said about it
Malta Bend catch wind, Iama aim at 'em
Reinforce, bigger course, I'm insane at it
Strange Music, nigga, get your brain scattered
Niggas been sleepin', I been peepin'
Carvin' you niggas out a classic, here's your safe keepin'
That misdirection got your head leakin'
I'm out here creepin' while you niggas sleepin'
Stick and I move, I'm feeding the faculty, eat
Janky promoters, they fuck you I'm raisin' the fee
Dead or alive the list of my five would be, it's:
Pac and Biggie
And Em
Then Nina
Then me
Little buddy been gettin' older, I gotten older, I'm colder, will leave you niggas a cold shoulder
Re-evaluate your composure, your moto is out of order, you want gas with that Rolls
CES pressure bust pipes, nigga turn it up
Niggas interviewin' 'plying they ain't earn enough
Stevie next up in line, watch me burn it up
Other niggas decline, need to huddle up
Very few that could fuck wi' me (fuck wi' me)
Summer time mind, nigga stuck wi' me
It takes a certain type of breed to run the lead
Words'll be weaponry I'ma buck, homie
3rd round, shut it down, this a warning shot
Give them skinny jeans niggas something to worry 'bout
I'ma barge in, nigga, you can clear it out
Wanna fall in, nigga you get blurred out
Nigga I'm not done eatin', I'm speakin', they tweakin' the verbal beat and I'm here to learn niggas
Let it burn, let it burn (let it burn, let it burn)
I see you actin' all concerned, nigga
Turn the tube on, Nikki nominated Grammy
Meek Mill, Nikki Mill, where they gettin' married?
Young nigga upcoming, bitch I been ready
Stevie Stone, Strange Music
Boy I fuck- ah-hah (eat)
