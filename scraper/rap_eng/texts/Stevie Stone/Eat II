[Intro]
Dinner will be served in
5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
I come to prepare a dinner plate
I brought a few of my family members to demonstrate
Niggas here to (eat)
Send me to take lead seat deplete they fleet fuckin' with elites, compete my nigga (eat)
Send couple rounds a nigga the door unlock
Broken up your band nigga the floor drop
Whoever mention get the itchin' to diss 'em bitchin' I pay it to a visit, vision, I'm here to close shop
I gotta a head with no screws I ain't got it all
Contemplating one them xanies or adderall
I've been Ruthless check my motherfuckin' catalog
Now it's Strange game nigga, I'm an animal
These niggas emotional can't watch 'em shape shift
I send a kite to your region give you a face lift
Bitch I'm breakin' them barriers in the space ship
It's all bars, let's take it to the basics
The type of nigga that'll run to your pockets I'm sayin' my niggas superior
Hear you bumping your gums, you niggas is lame, ain't none of us scared of ya
Bringin' you down, I'm pointin' 'em out, all your gimmicks embarrassing
And you be tellin' your business she givin' the vision that damage your character
But you ain't from the block so clearly you ain't know no better
I brought some killers with me all you can eat is all you be tellin' 'em
We come to bombard the banquet
It's me, N9na, J.L, Joey Cool, take this nigga

[Verse 2: Joey Cool]
Clearly we are not the same person
Everybody's learnin' this is not the same sermon
I don't really understand the process of you vermin
There's a lack of unity amongst you that I'm not concerned with
You stick around here you get to learnin'
You get all the perks and permits
But first you gon' have to earn it
Your character gonna determine if you're determined
Slap my obstacles like pimps do they bitches and fuckin' turn it
I'm back drinkin' this jack drinkin' ass Joey and cigarette smoking in all black
Bad homie and some bad bitch with a fat ass dance for me I'm understanding you can't wait to get the pants off me
I'll walk up in this bitch struntin' like David Ruffin
Walk on the stage while somebody rockin' nigga it's nothing
I really party my habits gettin' hella expensive
Sometimes I wonder what happens if I wasn't dismissive
He want a picture, she want a picture, I get it
But if you create the picture I promise it's more prolifent nigga
Joey and shit he just actin' like he be with it
I don't care if it was once
I promise he don't forget it (ever)
Truly elite you can see it by who he came with, it ain't complicated
It's just particular this arrangement I be out of body
Just ask J.L, Ubi or Godi
Liable to catch a body then get a drink in the lobby
I be

[Verse 3: JL]
(Eat) Like I'm famished, they should've never not fed us
(Eat) Bottomless pit unsatisfied with this lettuce
(Eat) Huntin' rufflin' feathers tough to forget us
(Eat) Predators become culinary professors
In this cut throat kitchen where bitches be hidin' knives
(Eat) For a livin' like Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives
Slutty dimes see these diamonds and Donny Punani ties
And she dives for the recipe, press aggressively
Eyes wide firin' up the stoves pilot, they face bent
Sautéed entrees on trays amazement
Inspiring iron chef, higher food chain placement
Beast in deep grease, basted, test tasteness
Sweet straight eatin' they plate, fakin' the sleep
Jay sauce say with the beat the way Salt Bae is with meat
Heart shapes in the DM
Hearts race when they see him
Big fish in the shark tank dark shape in the deep end
Feel the threat as this way is makin' these women wet
Bettin' their legs are spreadin' like MJ's in the silhouette
Eatin' till I'm full and let every friend I met benefit
Using every bowl, utensil and plate in the dinner set
I'm gonna faithfully, honestly ain't nothing niggas could say to me
Thought I was dead when they could not awaken me
They dug a hole and they fell in mistakenly
Be on your a-game when aimin' this way at me
Ain't nothin' blockin' my view but the drapery
Dame at the top like there's infinite vacancy
Niggas be crazy, we praisin' the bravery
Eatin' large quantities and finish every bit relentlessly I'm diggin' in this
Give 'em bars 'til they finish all the gym equipment up at Planet Fitness
We can charge any bunch of niggas with a spittin' sentence
And I get a witness
With the "it is ours, take it" attitude
We chew this fast food up in this wicked business

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Peep Peep how I heat seek travel deep feet just to eat meat
Beast teeth mangle with beef let the peace leak then I Chief Keef
'Cause I ain’t trippin’ off no bitch assness, I rip past this
You pick hell then you get ashes, a big fail like skipped classes
People feelin’ like they made N9na 'cause I did shows and they paid N9na
In the area of 8 mile but they actin’ like they Kim Basinger
All I ever do is show love Juggalo does get a show plug from a flow thug
Now they grow grudge when I bareback a nigga no rub
Had to work for the love on the Wicked Wonka tour fans turned backs
Til I hit ’em with the Stamina and then they turned around N9na earned that
Told Joe I’d be tourin’ when they do the March gotta go stack homie to pay for my divorce
Now he tryin’ to make the people turn another back on me
Nigga I don’t need NOTHIN', but this music, and these grands, and all the fans
And my children, an apology for you doggin’ me and my B crew
On a beach somewhere in Miami with my lady’s punani I can eat too

[Outro]
(Eat)
