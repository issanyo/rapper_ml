[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Wake up early in mornings
Forecast rainy and stormy
Say a prayer
I'm so well
Silhouette of the sun appears
Still breathin' I thank God
Overcome all obstacles against odds
In the air
It's in the air
The sun's around the corner
Another chapter I can thumb through
I can't unravel or undo
That's where it comes to
But we will work it out
Nobody we don't need, we the ones who
Find a way
My mind frame's common sense
Other part of me [?] ain't makin' dollars and cents
In the air
It's in the air
The suns around the corner

[Hook: Adrian Truth]
I'm gonna pray for better days
And lord I'm willing, I'ma find my way
In the mean time, in between time
I gotta get through this chapter
Caught up in the rapture
Leaning on Jacob's Ladder
I'm gonna pray for better days
And lord I'm willing I'ma find my way
In the mean time, in between time
I gotta get through this chapter
Caught up in the rapture
Leaning on Jacob's Ladder
Ladder
Leaning on Jacob's ladder
Ladder
Jacob's ladder
Ladder

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Yeah
Been leanin' on the ladder of Jacob
Maximizin', multiplyin' the cake up
Can not let them catch me slippin'
If I do I be sittin' on my [?]
There's better days
There's better days
Lord's willing is that I don't have a ceiling
Meditating what I'm feelin' praying to find a way

[Hook: Adrian Truth]
I'm gonna pray for better days
And lord I'm willing I'ma find my way
In the mean time, in between time
I gotta get through this chapter
Caught up in the rapture
Leaning on Jacob's Ladder
I'm gonna pray for better days
And lord I'm willing, I'ma find my way
In the mean time, in between time
I gotta get through this chapter
Caught up in the rapture
Leaning on Jacob's Ladder

[Outro: Adrian Truth]
In the water
Wait
In the water
Sinkin', wait
In the water, oh my god
Can you hear me?
