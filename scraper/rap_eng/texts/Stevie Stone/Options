[Intro]
When the base get to droppin'
When the base get to droppin'
Stevie Stone

[Hook]
It don't matter when the base get to droppin'
S&M  knockin'
Hoes get to poppin'
Man that boy got options
(When the base get to droppin')
(S&M  knockin')
(Hoes get to poppin')
(Man that boy got options)

[Post hook]
Makin' dough, drinkin' mo'
Smokin' weed, all I know
Makin' dough, drinkin' mo'
Smokin' weed, all I know

[Verse 1]
Well I'm back now, feelin' underrated
I done blacked out, come here for confirmation
Send them packs out, ain't got no moderation
Went and latched out, I got 'em kinda hatin'
I feel like 2Pac, bitch I'm Makaveli
Momma juggin' on 'em, she look like Halle Berry
She from Daytona, got a sneak peak
Her body pokin' out, she let me skeet skeet!
I'm here to make my rounds, Stevie showin' up
Got that A1, that's that uncut
Went and touched down, better raise up
Niggas hatin' on me! We gettin' paper

[Verse 2]
I was on [?], got my wings 'n' shit
GPS up on the pussy, I can ping that shit
Hit the club body vocal, what I see I get
Throw the [?] wide open, shoulda' seen that bit
She be poppin' (she be poppin')
Well I'ma get that bit
Get it, get it baby boy
[?]'s that bitch
I'm just sayin' now (sayin' now)
All my green goes lit
We been makin' power moves, watch the team get rich (get rich)
Roll up (roll up), roll up (roll up), roll up (roll up), roll (roll)
I brought the big box - call me manic though
Flex on me, naw - I crack the cantaloupe
[?] blockers bitch! Choosin' give 'em Adderall
