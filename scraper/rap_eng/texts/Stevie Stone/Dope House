Party at the dope house
Party at the dope house

[Verse 1: King Harris]
Party at the dope house
Who brought the weed I'm bout to show out
All the bad bitches sleeping early
Cause a thot is sucking dick like it's a blowout
I prefer the cream, keep that bitch she hella thick
[?] from the leaches and the snakes
Heard that shit went to my head and now they feel some type of way
Throw the money back and forth like it's a game of Keep Away
Hoe you know we popping bottles like it's summer 2012
Only two weeks out of jail got the word back on the scale
Hoe you know, that shit filthy, they don't feel me unless you film me
And that Boeing 33, like who drunk ain't coming with me
Let 'em know

[Refrain]
Party at the dope house
Party at the dope house

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
This here for my niggas who be [?] everyday
Whooping in the kitchen  [?]
Baby momma get
