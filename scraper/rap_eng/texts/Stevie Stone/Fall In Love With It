Flashing lights
You can have whatever you like
Girl, I'll change your life
Fall in love with it, you can fall in love with it
She takin' it down to the floor, and she know I got more
I got more, it's just what she wants
(Yeah, bring it back now)
She working that pole
Girl, you know what you doin'
Keep movin' like that, they gon' fall in love

Ooh fall in love with it, you can fall in love with it
(Fall in love with it) X4

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Baby got gifts
Badder than a mother fucker vibin' with them hips
When she get up to the pole, when she do her little tricks
Do a cartwheel, slide down, bounce to the splits
She walk up in the room and control it
She eyeing down the ones with money, come forward
Make a nigga fall in love with it, money you blow it
With the fifteen hundred 'fore a nigga even knew her
I love the way she move, look back at it
She got a nigga stuck and throwing racks at it
Lil' mama she's a thicky
Got a face like Cameron and an ass like Nicki

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Ugh, bring it back now
Down 3 stacks, mommy gon' act out
Ass so big she could back Shaq down
And all them other bitches faded in the background
Yup, she a go-getter
And you will never ever see her with a broke nigga
In the club she bringin' over 4 wit' her
Body shots, keep 'em coming, bring mo' liquor
She told me fill the cup to the brim (to the brim)
She tokin' like she tryna stackin them
She do it like she workin' at a gym
Attitude like Rihanna, and a body like Kim
