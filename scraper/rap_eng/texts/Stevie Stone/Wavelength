[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Oh, yeah
Okay

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
You're calling my phone
I pick it up before it rings
See, we be doing things like that
Put your phone in airplane mode
You're unavailable
Now let me lay you on your back

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
She flip me over, start to go down
Toes get to curling me
She doing the most, and what a hell of a way
To start out a nigga day
She fucking defeated me, I been working kinda late
Baby in tune with me, them actions say
She come out in tune with me, she out that way
We go play
(We be making love)
That motion, positions, and that lotion
I go head first in that wet, wet
And I'm knee deep in that ocean
The new neighbors keep complaining
No, I'm not bragging, I'm not boasting
But mama putting that candy on me like
(We be making love)
Touching, I got a sweet tooth and I'm lusting
We're on the same wave, I know the tame baby
Done changed lanes and done cuffed her
I used to shack up upon the weekends
Doing rock and I'ma creep in
Inside I feel we sink in like

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
I put that on everything
Girl, you're thinking what I'm thinking
Before I even speak one word
So put that on everything
But your heart is my heart
Before you even say a word

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
We be on the same wavelength
Loving how you speak to me
I can feel your frequency
Especially when you freaking me
(Wavelength)
And if it ain't broke, don't fix it
Girl, we on the same wavelength

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Same wavelength, time travel at the day shift
Back nine, we here to face this
Cruise control, we could pace this
Cat and mouse, I'ma chase this
I like the way you tease me, do it gracious
We so compatible, baby, we in the Matrix
And even if we tried, we couldn't fake this
Damn, it's not ordinary
Appetite, I'm like more than merry
Keep you close, you extraordinary
Long term, not momentary
Bowflex, replace this, we bond well, all bases
This wavelength climbs stages like
(We be on the same wavelength)

[Verse 3: Bossiemossie]
God must've known what he was doing
When he placed me in that room
'Cause electrically we connected
Identical mind frames
Forever, endlessly, our love is manifesting
Such sweet indulgences in every one of our sessions
Master of my circumference with every inches of you
Internal gripping is what I pursue
No distance between you and I
And the measurements could never lie
True story, no fairy tales
We do us very well
Been on the same page ever since
Simply blessed to be on the same wavelength

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
We be on the same wavelength
Loving how you speak to me
I can feel your frequency
Especially when you freaking me
Wavelength
And if it ain't broke, don't fix it
Girl, we on the same wavelength
