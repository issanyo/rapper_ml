[Intro/Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Ok fellas this is it
We got together to play our kind of music and so far nobody's let us
Well we're going to play it tonight whether they like it or not
We're going to do all our good numbers tonight, every single one of them
We'll start with 1 O'Clock Jump

[Hook]
Ballin'
Talk is cheap, the bodies start to fall in
Rumors rappers are leanin on the wall again
Going all in, watch me put the pause in
What your man got, dawgs out there banging like Bangkok
Smoke clears we leaving off the main lot
Time's up, when the bass drop

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
You don’t hear me though
See your little bitter comments on the videos
Your peers and your ears bumping my material
See me, yo I’m the shit just in general, what [?]
They’d shoot me, I’m made you look
Never lying, landmine in my ramble
Crunch time on the grind got the line hooked
Fat dime think I’m lying got them all shook
You ain’t all that, 150 shows a year what you call that
Couple bad bitches groping on my ballsack
Fuck a fiend that could, pussy sipping cognac, haters fall back
1 O’Clock I’m getting the dope spot
The person with the pack raising the cap to smoke guap
Fiends is steady coming, the money it won’t stop

[Bridge]
We got together to play our kind of music and so far nobody's let us

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
ATLien extraterrestrial
I'm in this bitch like I don't give a fuck, I've got an extra pair of testicles
I fuck your bitch then fall asleep on the couch with my draws and the tv on
That afternoon I killed you first, then cut up the corpse with Stevie Stone
Life in the jungle wasn't shit that my mama could teach
Should've used a coat hangar to kill me when I was a fetus
Go eat a Snickers cause you rappers just bitches and beavers
Fucking cupcakes, faggots with feminine features
I never trust women and reachers
I'm not a human being, I'm a different creature
I love ratchet bitches, belligerent skeezers
After I beat the pussy up then we getting some pizza
I'm pimpin' bitches with telekinesis
After your mom give me a blumpkin I'm nailing your nieces
Fuck your thoughts, to hell with your thesis
After we take the organs out then we mail them to Jesus
