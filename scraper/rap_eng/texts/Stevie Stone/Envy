[Hook: Suli4Q]
I can see the envy in your eyes
You jealous, you hate to see a nigga on the rise
You jealous, envy dripping all over you
Envy dripping all over you (drip, drip)
Envy dripping all over you (drip, drip, drip)

[Verse 1: JL]
Jelly drip, dripping like its sweat
Obsessed upset
Suspect, suspect
Staring like they've seen a wrecked car
Like cleavage in a V-neck
Play my cards like a vet
If I poke her like 3 deck
Oh yes no jokers
Does some queens with the foolery
Mo' checks mo' vultures
Waiting like they get gratuity
I ain't gotta say a word
It's written all on your ugly face
It's a movie scene swerve
Is you the police on the case?
Like is you with the age of seeing all
What are you doing, who does it involve?
Figured you'd be tappin' in on every call
Could be cooperating with the law
You got a magazine I got a vlog
What are you logging my dialogue?
Envy like Nevada fuck y'all

[Hook: Suli4Q]
I can see the envy in ya eyes
You jealous, you hate to see a nigga on the rise
You jealous, envy dripping all over you
Envy dripping all over you (drip, drip)
Envy dripping all over you (drip, drip, drip)

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Hatin' on a nigga, envy unfold
What they doing Stone?
Wishing all them niggas done for
I'm elite though
Mommy, get to choosing
You can keep those
Word around the city she a freak hoe
Beefing over bitches at a bistro going beast-mode
Notice who be hating bet they pockets out commission
Every chance you get you pillow talking to these bitches
I can feel the envy energy, it get to dripping
When I walk into the room I see you looking at me different
Diamonds acrobatic, dance and glisten
Get into the back fuckboi got an issue

[Hook: Suli4Q]
I can see the envy in ya eyes
You jealous, you hate to see a nigga on the rise
You jealous, envy dripping all over you
Envy dripping all over you (drip, drip)
Envy dripping all over you (drip, drip, drip)
