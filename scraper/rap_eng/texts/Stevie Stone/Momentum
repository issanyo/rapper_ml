[Verse 1]
Well I’m back momentum extension I shatter your opposition
They playin me huh! huh! they playin!
Now now now now I be rippin motha fuckas wanna cheer for me but im savin it for the chance to ?
Cause I'm loud and abrupt (abrupt, I'm loud and abrupt, abrupt)
When I speak the ground shakin this different strange is aroma (im on it)
Godzilla can hear me around the corner (I’m on it)
I’m an animal, vicious, you know I wanna (I’m on it)
Some five totally black bitches sippin' corona
Unleash elite figure
Born in the middle of the five seven triple

Thirteen million one thirty one thirty thousand momentum
Worthy make a nigga wanna serve me more ? with venom

[Bridge]
Ha ha I'm Idlewild (I'm Idlewild)

The money count (the money count)
The fire on the scene bring the water fountain

[Hook]
When I step out I bring momentum (I’m on it)
If I see it I want it I go and get it (I’m on it)
If you're looking for competition come get it (I’m on it)
Rolling stone keep rollin' and rollin' on (I’m on it)
Momentum (I’m on it) momentum (I’m on it) momentum (I’m on it) momentum (I’m on it) momentum, momentum (I’m on it) momentum, momentum (I’m on it)

[Verse 2]
You know I’m on it, Nina told me to get em
Comin' from rock bottom soarin' up over buildings
Ha I get to buckin' and stressin' and catching feelins'
Superstar in the making, guesstimating the millions (I’m on it)
We friends picasso we wonder and cause a ruckus (I’m on it)
Two middle fingers I’m hollerin', screamin' fuck it!
Your problem you can't touch it, problem you better tuck it
I followed down the lines of my LeToya Luckett
Comprine and I abduct it find the coke getter
A bald-headed, corn-fed country-ass nigga
(run it back) (run it back) (run it back) run it back!
I'm far out I'm out of space and coming back
