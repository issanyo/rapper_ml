[Verse 1]
One of elites, know it
24 karat loaded, boy done got a pleasure
Bitch I been a poet, pen the pen up on it
In the back blazin', show the back pacin'
Got me levitatin', highly medicated
This that Sammy Davis, bitch I'm highly favored
Fuck your Tudor maze, I done combed the pavement
Smoking all your favorite, this that candy painted
Check yo body language, yeah
'Bout to cop a Benz or two tho
Me and Kali boy we the duo
Pockets all Rambo, sumo (what?)
Pockets all Rambo, sumo
Real come hit it with the bass drum
Crippin' like it's on like they can
Cheffin' in the kitchen with an apron
Bitch gotta learn, hold up
All my life when they hate this
Ten toes down on the lot
Came in the game with the cadence
Ain't nobody tell me when to go
Fort put a feelin' like Kobe
Plot down, still can't hold me
Know a couple niggas that owe me
Watch me while I'm zoning

[Hook]
We don't play, we don't pray
We don't fake, we go hard
Parlay, what I make
I don't bit, it's my lot
I be zonin', I be zonin'
Bitch I'm zonin', I be zonin'
I be zonin', I be zonin'
Yes I'm on 'em, yes I'm on 'em
Get it pay, I don't stake
Bitch I'm me, I'm a boss
Piece of cake, can I make
Let 'em hate, fuck 'em all
I be zonin', I be zonin'
Bitch I'm zonin', I be zonin'
Call me Stonie, call me Stonie
Yes I'm on 'em

[Verse 2]
These niggas gon' act up and then these dogs gon' rage
These dogs ain't leashed up when they beefed up so I'm ready
I don't wanna talk bitch, I'm just tryna stack a dolla
I don't bother, put that sauce on a hoe, lord
Ima come through to the table with scruples
I'm giving you up the loose deuce
For all of you niggas that really doubt me
I'm eating some steak with the couscous
I'm giving you niggas the Blue's Clues
I'm smoking on tropical lover
My mama be drippin the puddles
I told you I dipped and then budded (hold up)
All my life when they hate this
You ain't never seen this before
Came in the shit guns blazin'
Niggas should've hit on the flow
Boys in the hood with an oldie
Like a nigga down with a four piece
Big butts keep it stoning
Watch me while I'm zoning

[Hook]
We don't play, we don't pray
We don't fake, we go hard
Parlay, what I make
I don't bit, it's my lot
I be zonin', I be zonin'
Bitch I'm zonin', I be zonin'
I be zonin', I be zonin'
Yes I'm on 'em, yes I'm on 'em
Get it pay, I don't stake
Bitch I'm me, I'm a boss
Piece of cake, can I make
Let 'em hate, fuck 'em all
I be zonin', I be zonin'
Bitch I'm zonin', I be zonin'
Call me Stonie, call me Stonie
Yes I'm on 'em
