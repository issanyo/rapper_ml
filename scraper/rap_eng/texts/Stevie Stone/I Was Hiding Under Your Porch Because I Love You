[Verse]
My head’s still rich
And my heart’s still broke
It feels like I’ve been here
Too many times before
So even though I stopped this once not so long ago
I never made my mistakes; you’ll never reap what you sow
(Never reap what you sow)
So now I’ve said that this has gone too far
Too far
Too far (yeah!)

[Chorus]
Whoa, you’ll never know
Whoa, you’ll never know
Whoa, you’ll never know
Till we’re gone, whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, you’ll never know
Whoa, you’ll never know
Whoa, you’ll never know
Till we’re gone, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Bridge]
Sticks and stones may break my bones but:
(What happens next?) I guess we’ll never know
Sticks and stones may break my bones but:
(What happens next?) I guess we’ll never
Sticks and stones may break my bones but:
(What happens next?) I guess we’ll never know
Sticks and stones may break my bones but:
(What happens next?) I guess we’ll never know

[Chorus]
Whoa, you’ll never know
Whoa, you’ll never know
Whoa, you’ll never know
Till we’re gone, whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, you’ll never know
Whoa, you’ll never know
Whoa, you’ll never know
Till we’re gone, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Outro]
It’s just you and me
Through all these inconsistencies
It’s like the way you move
When no one’s watching
When no one's watching you
Through all these inconsistencies
Like the way you move
When no one's watching you
When no one's watching you
(She’s got me in my own head now
Filling it up with aspirations)
When no one's watching you
When no one's watching you
It’s just you and me
Through all these inconsistencies
It’s like the way you move
When no one’s watching you
