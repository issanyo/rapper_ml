[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Better brace yourself for the second coming
Gotta clear that, it's the baggage now I'm off and running
Did you hear that? Can you feel that?
It's static 'cause I finally done it
Spread a little bit of magic on you chocolate bunnies, I get it in!
Big Stone don't play no more
No - never not gettin' paid no more
Say what you really wanna say
You niggas wanna hate, but you really can't hate no more
No – never not on a stage no more
Strange Music dipped in butter
Different faces colors
Could of been alot of others
Repping M-I-crooked letter-crooked letter-O-U-R-I
Classify my shit together (shit together)
Struttin' with my feet together, clip together
Got my crib together, yeah I got my shit together

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Get buck!
Step on scene and they need me
And they know if you [?] trynna see me
Just because I get buck!
Callin' it a blast from the past
And tonight I'm 'bout to get up in that ass
You gon' watch me get buck!
Know you on the sideline hatin'
And your formula’s fitted to fakin' little buddy
Get buck!
Head like a Rorschak, shakin'
And you got the nerve to question what I’m thinkin'?
I'm about to get buck!

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Hear the product?
Well it sound good, don't it?
Talk more shit I’ll make you get our weight and rep your hood on it
Yeah, I stepped out, hopped out the back seat
Hot step, snake bat, fitted to the back
Hold the turf, reppin' lately
Been in my zone here, lately
How to [?] wall hear lately
I'mma get up in that ass from the middle with a map
From the MO all the way to Haiti, cravin' bitches is crazy
Crazy motherfuckers got crazy
Nigass wanna get up in the feelings, I'm surrounded by their ladies
Hey, whatchya sayin'? Whatchya sayin? (what you sayin' boy?)
Haters think we play, think we playin? (playin, huh?)
Kawasaki crotchrocket
Got that burner in my pocket in case you niggas try to stop it

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Get buck!
Step on scene and they need me
And they know if you [?] trynna see me
Just because I get buck!
Callin' it a blast from the past
And tonight I'm 'bout to get up in that ass
You gon' watch me get buck!
Know you on the sideline hatin'
And your formula’s fitted to fakin' little buddy
Get buck!
Head like a Rorschak, shakin'
And you got the nerve to question what I’m thinkin'?
I'm about to get buck!
