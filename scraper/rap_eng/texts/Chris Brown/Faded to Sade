[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
We can match a blunt up, listening to Sade
Do just what you wanna, echoes in the attic but we fucking in the basement
Didn't notice that the sun up, we must have fell asleep to Sade
You give me a fever, I've been catching feelings I'm having trouble erasing

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
So it's all up to you, girl, what's the point of playing cool?
All of us know, girl, you the shit, yeah, you the truth

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, I've been missing your love all night, jump on it
'Cause baby, I've been missing your love
So we gon' do it 'til the morning
Girl, you ain't got shit to say unless you talking making love
Let's lay it down and play
Make you scream my name
I'm gonna play another love song
Gonna play that Sade, faded to Sade

[Verse 2: Lyrica Anderson]
Let's light another blunt up, getting faded to the Sade
Can I kiss it for a moment? I'll relax my body while you spelling "la de da di" with your tongue

[Pre-Chorus: Lyrica Anderson & Chris Brown]
So it's all up to you, boy, what's the point of playing games?
All of us know, boy, you the shit, boy, you the truth

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, I've been missing your love all night, jump on it
'Cause baby, I've been missing your love
So we gon' do it 'til the morning
Girl, you ain't got shit to say unless you talking making love
Let's lay it down and play
Make you scream my name
I'm gonna play another love song
Gonna play that Sade, faded to Sade

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Lyrica Anderson]
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, I really wanna play your game
I'm ready, girl, to wear you out, I think that it's about time for you to scream my name
Say oh, baby girl, you got that something
You know that one thing, you know what it is, your love, love

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, I've been missing your love all night, jump on it
'Cause baby, I've been missing your love
So we gon' do it 'til the morning
Girl, you ain't got shit to say unless you talking making love
Let's lay it down and play
Make you scream my name
I'm gonna play another love song
Gonna play that Sade, faded to Sade
