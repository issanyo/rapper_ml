Different strokes for different folks (Different strokes)
Everybody got they own preference
All I wanted was some time, with you (Some time)
But you kept comparing me to, your ex dude
I don’t wanna go back to the man that I used to be
But you might make me, you might make me, yeah
So if you keep pushing me and I decide to go
Please don’t hate me, please don’t hate me, yeah
You know, it seems one sided
I can feel the breeze, and I like it

[Chorus]
We’re going different ways
We can’t go head to head, with each other
I know you tried to keep, that secret
Now you can’t hide it
We’re going different ways
