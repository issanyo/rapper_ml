[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Girl, you know we got the time
Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing?
I know you're ready, show that ass
Girl, you looking so bad, getting horny watching you do it
Girl, I wanna kiss it
While you kissing your girlfriends
I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory
Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Ha, look, I be banging all on that beat
808, she got the bass when her booty shake
She got her friends with her and they a sight to see
All that ass, don't let it go to waste
All this Hennessy, this liquor, 'bout to penetrate
While I'm pushing Lamborghini's on the interstate
I long-dick her, I'ma go for hours
You minute-made like lemonade
I'm fresh as fuck in these Margielas
I skate past, a nigga better than veterans
Bipolar cold, give me the medicine
My chain too bright, no Thomas Edison
When I pull it out, bitch nervous
Better ride this wave, bitch, surf it
Girl, you better keep them legs open
Only thing you close is these curtains
And she only got time for a nigga, if I take her out to eat
A nigga really gotta motivate
Man, that's too much work for the pussy
I don't work for the pussy, nigga really don't communicate
Ha, I'd rather lick it like a dinner plate
I'd rather keep my money in a safe
Ha, bitch, I ain't got time to play
I need it now, not a minute late, ha

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Girl, you know we got the time
Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing?
I know you're ready, show that ass
Girl, you looking so bad, getting horny watching you do it
Girl, I wanna kiss it
While you kissing your girlfriends
I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory
Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I got cash out, and that ass out
Hit it once then I pass out
Diamonds all in my chain
Her dress see through in my glass house
I lick the pussy, goin’ through the motions
I scuba dive her, when I’m in that ocean
I lick her down, I’ma dick her down
She gon’ beg a nigga, just to bend her over
In the backseats, she gettin’ backshots
Doggy style, i’ma dog her out
She gon’ throw that back, i’ma smack that shit
Thats what the fuck I’m talkin’ ‘bout
And she only want a nigga like me though
No gag reflex when she deepthroat
And she only fucks with them light skin niggas
Like El Debarge and I’m Chico, ha
What you want babe, tell me if you need that shit
All on the media in the take out
The front page don’t believe that shit
I done made so much money
This new shit is gettin’ old to me, nigga check the resume
And i got all the girls singing like Jodeci
Thats why

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Girl, you know we got the time
Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing?
I know you're ready, show that ass
Girl, you looking so bad, getting horny watching you do it
Girl, I wanna kiss it
While you kissing your girlfriends
I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory
Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Blowing up the line on my cellular
She wanna lock a nigga down, on the regular
Talking crazy to me like she own the dick
But I don't trust her as far as I can throw the bitch, ha
Momma told me to find a keeper
But I switch like designer sneakers
A girl with the finest features
Every nigga wanna talk to her but I got her first, finders keepers
Violins in the back, is my theme music
Her ass on my mind, I dream booty
Any nigga tryna fuck my bitch
Then it's off with his head, how kings do it
My rings ruby, red bandana, I stay wooping
Got too many cribs, I stay moving
Three Lambos, I stay couping
Ha, but you don't hear me though
Virginia to the Westside
Car foreign, the girl sit on the left side
Smoking weed on the plane, that's the best high
She gotta sign the waiver 'fore I let her fly
Helipad on the boat
Chilling in the South of France, Saint-Tropez, Nice, Monaco
But nothing compare to what's in my pants
Girl, stop playing

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Girl, you know we got the time
Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing?
I know you're ready, show that ass
Girl, you looking so bad, getting horny watching you do it
Girl, I wanna kiss it
While you kissing your girlfriends
I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory
Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me
