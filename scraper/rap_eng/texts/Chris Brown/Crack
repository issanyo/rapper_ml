[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Ayy, killer shit
Villainous, hero, don't give a shit
Hancock, Will Smith
Adrenaline, with a twist
Take pride that I'm so Chi
These young bucks just a nuisance
To my sidekicks
This shit here like magic
Yeah, this here like magic
Abracadabra, rabbits
No hook but so hooked
Take crack at my habits
Neutron but too bomb
Did it all with no tablets
It's a write off if it costs right
Get your light blue
Then the off white

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain’t fucking with your drama, no
Baby, all you wanna do is hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it
Make me lose my mind, girl, I can see it
I ain’t fucking with your drama, no, yeah, yeah
Baby, all you wanna do is hit it, hit it
Get it, bang, bang, bang
Fuck me real good, tell me that you'll never let me go

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
No fares, dope fiends
Don't try that nose sting
Police rushed in
And they red lights, they got rocks and
Code D, codeine
On that James Dean, call it James Dean
Say watch that, watch that
You might die driving the same thing
Same thing, same thing
Whoop whoop, see that shit?
Triple entendre no accident
Might crash tryna catch this shit
Contact if you catch a whiff
All contact that I catch adrift
That I kick-block
Then stop, on ken dot
Tryna stack of bricks
Like 10 rocks crush it up and don't touch it up
While you uppercut
Shoryuken fuck it up
Nigga, let 'em hit it raw
Send it through your system through a car antenna
Nigga, how she feelin' when it lands deeply in her jaw

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain’t fucking with your drama, no
Baby, all you wanna do is hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it
Make me lose my mind, girl, I can see it
I ain’t fucking with your drama, no, yeah, yeah
Baby, all you wanna do is hit it, hit it
Get it, bang, bang, bang
Fuck me real good, tell me that you'll never let me go

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Higher from the back, fire from the top
Fire to the buyer to the tryer of the rock
Supplier to the buyer to the drivers of the drop
Lighter to the higher, to the writer to the cops
Lighter to the pipe or set fire to the crops
Freebase, crack, rock
Supply it worldwide when they fire at the box
Police raid, trap hot
Police state, black plot
Drier than the fire so there's violence a lot
Price is going higher so they're firing the shots
Die or  survive, it's survival of the block
That's your girl, I could X that, by any means, I get it clean
One last hit, and that's it, she won't act it, can't intervene

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain’t fucking with your drama, no
Baby, all you wanna do is hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it
Make me lose my mind, girl, I can see it
I ain’t fucking with your drama, no, yeah, yeah
Baby, all you wanna do is hit it, hit it
Get it, bang, bang, bang
Fuck me real good, tell me that you'll never let me go
