[Verse 1]
3 in the morning, you know I'm horny
So why don't you come over my place and put a smile on my face?
Leaving the club, shawty hurry up
So we can get this party started and take off our clothes now
You already know what time it is
Reach up in that dresser where them condoms is
And baby, when I get it, I'll never let it go
Gonna take it slow

[Pre-Chorus]
We ain't gon' stop 'til 9 AM
If you can't take it all, baby say when
Make you cum over and over again
And I'mma leave it in

[Chorus]
When we do it all night
We can do it all night
Girl I'mma give it to you all night
So fly girl
Don't you be on that bullshit, yeah yeah, all night
Don't you be on that bullshit, yeah yeah, all night
Don't you be on that bullshit, yeah yeah, all night
So fly girl

[Verse 2]
Now there are one or two things that can happen at this time of the hour
So baby, after we get out of the shower
You can race me to the bed
Turn off all the lights and light some candles instead
Oh, yeah, I can hear your body calling, baby
Oh, yeah, we gon' get freaky
You know, darling, you know what time it is
Get it in, I'mma do it all

[Pre-Chorus]
We ain't gon' stop 'til 9 AM
If you can't take it all, baby say when
Make you cum over and over again
And I'mma leave it in

[Chorus]
When we do it all night
