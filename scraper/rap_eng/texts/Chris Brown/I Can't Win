[Verse 1]
Tell me what did I do to make you hate me so much?
Why you angry all the time? Why you don't wanna ride for me?
Girl, we used to make love, when you called, I would follow
Now the only thing you love is a bottle, the only thing you got left is a shadow

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let this shit come between us, I'm wrong, you're right
It's okay with my heart, but it's not how it's supposed to be, yeah
You always say, "I'm done, we're finished," fuck it, I'm wrong, you're right
Please God, help us, I guess I'ma leave it up to you tonight, oh woah

[Chorus]
She ain't bluffing, she gon' do it
I think it's time for me to face the music
I couldn't really give a damn about my pride
But the way you acting is stupid
You going back and forth
With the lies, never compromise
Girl, if you love me, better prove it
Baby, I can't win, I can't win for losing

[Verse 2]
Don't even matter if you screaming, yeah, girl you don't love me, you don't love yourself
But it don't matter if you raising Hell, I miss you, I wanna kiss you, yeah
I can't remember who you are, babe, remember when your heart used to say
Love me, babe, love me, babe, I know them bitches got in your way but

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let this shit come between us, I'm wrong you're right
It's okay with my heart, but it's not how it's supposed to be, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
She ain't bluffing, she gon' do it
I think it's time for me to face the music
I couldn't really give a damn about my pride
But the way you acting is stupid
You going back and forth
With the lies, never compromise
Girl, if you love me, better prove it
Baby, I can't win, I can't win for losing

[Bridge]
I'm not tryna waste our love, I'm just tryna save what's left of it
One day, one day my love, you gon' realise that you fucked up
And when that day comes, my love, I'm gon' be the same one still loving
How are you gonna cancel me out? Say I won't listen, but I'm listening now

[Chorus]
She ain't bluffing, she gon' do it
I think it's time for me to face the music
I couldn't really give a damn about my pride
But the way you acting is stupid
You going back and forth
With the lies, never compromise
Girl, if you love me, better prove it
Baby, I can't win, I can't win for losing
