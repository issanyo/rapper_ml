[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Uh, put my ex-girlfriend on time out
Now I’m with my new bitch, knockin' her spine out
Rollin' up more kush, waitress pass a bottle though
Party with a lot of niggas, keep a couple model hoes
I party hard like Charlie Sheen
Used to Ferraris, been drivin' it since 17
Cash Money, Young Money, baby
You already know I get it poppin', ask your lady
Sellin' out the Garden when I want to like Jay-Z
Right now I'm killin' 'em, broad of hoes, fillin' 'em
Treat 'em like construction sites, you know that I'm drillin' 'em
Half these rappers soft as fuck, I swear to God they ain't fittin' in
Me and Chris ain't green house
In Miami hittin' in the club buy the bar out, stunna bring the cars out
Hey, where you're comin' from Bow? Fresh off the movie set
Uh, oh, yeah, there's another check
Now these haters upset
Rappers twice my age ain't done what I done yet
I ain't even done yet, this just the beginnin'
Steppin' out that G4, here some brand new linen fresh
Yes, I'm the motherfuckin' best
Walkin' through life, with no regrets
Shit, I ain't trippin', no, you know I be chillin'
Rico, where you buy that shit? Doggy got me wigged
Yeah, my game up, and you play what? Do somethin' and I dare ya
Rearrange your face and now somebody gotta repair that shit
I'm the best there is and the best there was like Bret Hart, Paul Bart, with no Bart
My bank account and my work ethic, that's what settin' us apart
Heat game, court-side, me and all my niggas
Keepin' my hands clean, my body guards talk triggers
My paper on giant, your paper on midget
Fuck all my enemies who tend to be tellin' me
Shit, beggin' me, screamin' with they hands out
But I don't get no hand out, put me in a room and watch me stand out
I'm done talkin' to these niggas, man
I'm 'bout to go ahead and talk about Breezy now homie hold me down homie

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Yeah look huh, BBC on my head, fuck a nigga, act like a grown up
Everybody know you a pussy, little nigga get your soul up
Niggas say they your friends, Bow Wizzle, that's a real nigga
And I'm about to go in, time to kill niggas
Y'all wanna talk about naked pics, here, you can shake my hand, you can shake my dick
Jewels swang low and my dick hit the water when I take a piss
I'm talkin' porno, then I'm outy five
Audi hit the uh then I'm blowin' like four O’s
Yeah, in the jacuzzi with four hoes
Gotta mix a Nuvo with the no doughs
Sleep, gotta pull a all nighter
Paper planes, got 'em high like a sky diver
Yeah and now I'm fuckin' with 'em hood niggas
Red and blue nigga, R&B, so what's good, nigga?
I'm out of line, yup yup 'cause I should, nigga
Try to swing, I dare you, I wish you would, nigga
Wow, let me calm down
All these suckers mad 'cause I took they shine now
I'm at the top dawg, ain't about to climb down
You need to give it up, ain't ’bout to whine down

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
Why they all up in my B.I? Kush and O, I feel ya
Nowadays so stressed out 'cause this business will kill ya
Shit, we getting real paper, fuck haters, fuck blogs
Fuck y'all, standin' tall, retaliation, sit on y'all
Chris is the prince of R&B, me hella prince of hip-hop
We got it on lock and we on tour, that's more whores
Countin' money when I get bored, tatted up like a mother fuck
Swear to God it's too easy, yeah, my neck and wrist freezin', Wizzle or just Bow Weezy?
You already know nigga, shout out to the O, nigga
You know I be reppin'
Smoke 'cause of depression, homie ain't no question
Get rappers the business, just for me to test it, Wizzle

[Hook: Bow Wow]
I'm the man in this bitch
'Bout to blow at least a hundred bands in this bitch, yeah

'Bout to blow at least a hundred bands in this bitch
