[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
She don't wanna go, go, but that's cool
'Cause she already know, know, how I do
She waiting her turn, she don't wanna leave
I can't blame her for wanting to chill with me
No, oh, oh
She no fool and everybody know, know, I'm that dude
So if it ain't her, it'd be her friend
I'm just tryna party like the world's gon' end, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Now I'm all up in my zone
I've been turning it up all night so I'm on
And ain't no way I'm leaving this club tonight alone
So who gon' be the lucky one that I take home?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Who that, who that is?
I'm looking for the girl who gon' do it for me
Who gon' be the one that's gon' do it for me?
'Cause it's a lot of girls that'll do it for me
So if it ain't you, she gon' do it for me
She gon' do it for me, yeah
She gon' do it for me
She gon' do it for me, yeah
She gon' do it for me
'Cause it's a lot of girls that'll do it for me
So who gon' be the one that'll do it for me?
Why you playing, girl?

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
Now shawty dropping low, low with her crew
And I like the way, way that she move
Making it hard for me to choose
Be either way you go, go, I can't lose
No, oh, oh
It's 'bout time for me to pick the one I'ma put on in my ride
I gotta hurry up, make up my mind
So baby, back it up 'cause we're running out of time

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Now I'm all up in my zone
I've been turning it up all night so I'm on
And ain't no way I'm leaving this club tonight alone
So who gon' be the lucky one that I take home?
