[Verse 1 : Usher]
She built a bridge out of her own insecurities
No one was brave enough to cross except for me, here I am, yeah
She built a castle from the piece she took from me
I'm going crazy, think she brought out the worst in me, here I am, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
Guess the price was the fall if I get up
'Cause the strong will survive, that don't give up
Where she fell in love, her heart is resting now
Six feet underground

[Chorus: Usher]
Oh, she feels stupid loving me for me, yeah
And I'm the fool who falls too easily
We all fall down sometimes, we all fall down sometimes
So why can't I? Hey, oh, so why can't I?

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You gotta go I know the time waits for no man
Don't say your words unspoken, girl, I over stand, here I am
What do we mean? Some questions don't have an answer
Two out of three made me a believer, here I am

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
Guess the price was the fall if I get up
'Cause the strong will survive, that don't give up
Where she fell in love, her heart is resting now
Six feet underground

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh, she feels stupid loving me for me, yeah
And I'm the fool who falls too easily
We all fall down sometimes, girl, we all fall down sometimes
So why can't I? Hey, so why can't I?

[Chorus: Usher & Chris Brown]
Oh, she feels stupid loving me for me, oh yeah
And I'm the fool who falls too easily
We all fall down sometimes, we all fall down sometimes
So why can't I? Hey, oh so why can't I?
