[Intro]
Ah, yeah
Didn't think you'd expect this one, right?
C. Breezy and Cee Cee
Excuse me Mr. DJ, you need to turn it up
This song is fire, I'm about to burn it up
You ready, I'm ready, go right to the left
If you get tired, you fired, so stay on track, I'ma holla back

[Verse 1: Ciara & Chris Brown]
I'm too beautiful to be alone
Take me to a place that only we know
What's the deal 'bout? What ya looking for?
Know what ya need, baby, come on

[Pre-Chorus: Ciara & Chris Brown]
Be my DJ tonight
Won't ya come and save my life?
You turn me on, me on, me on
But ya need another record
With something unexpected
To keep me going, me going, me going

[Chorus: Ciara & Chris Brown]
I want you to, turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me
Turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me
Turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me
Turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Ciara]
Running back I put you in a trance
Spinning like I record, I'm in your hands
My selection makes you wanna dance, yeah
Before ya leave I have one request

[Pre-Chorus: Ciara & Chris Brown]
Be my DJ tonight
Won't ya come and save my life?
You turn me on, me on, me on
But ya need another record
With something unexpected
To keep me going, me going, me going

[Chorus: Ciara & Chris Brown]
I want you to, turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me
Turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me
Turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me
Turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me

[Bridge: Ciara & Chris Brown]
Don't know why they trying for
They can't keep me off the floor
'Cause you keep me wanting more
Don't stop what you're doing
'Cause I don't know why they trying for
They can't keep me off the floor
'Cause you keep me wanting more
Don't stop what you're doing

[Pre-Chorus: Ciara & Chris Brown]
Be my DJ tonight
Won't ya come and save my life?
You turn me on, me on, me on
But ya need another record
With something unexpected
To keep me going, me going, me going

[Chorus: Ciara & Chris Brown]
I want you to, turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me
Turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me
Turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me
Turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me

[Interlude: Chris Brown & Ciara]
Ha, c'mon
Now turn 'em on me, baby
Why don't you turn 'em on me, baby?
I like that, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Ciara & Chris Brown]
Be my DJ tonight
Won't ya come and save my life?
You turn me on, me on, me on
But ya need another record
With something unexpected
To keep me going, me going, me going

[Chorus: Ciara & Chris Brown]
I want you to, turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me
Turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me
Turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me
Turn the tables, turn the tables
Turn the tables on me
