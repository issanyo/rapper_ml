[Intro]
Oohhh, yeah, oh

[Verse 1]
Some, yeah sometimes I was the one
Yeah I was the one running round acting wild
And sometimes you was the one
Turning up with your girls, only sometimes
Now my heart's looking the middle
All in the middle
Made my mistakes but I love my kid though
My wrongs got a list a mile long

[Chorus]
Now you wish I was the one
Wish I was the one who couldn't sleep now
Wish I was the one who couldn't eat now
Wish I was the one who couldn't breathe without the other one, now you
I'm the one that's supposed to be broken
Break me down and build me up
Wish that I could meet you half way
But I don't have the heart oh, don't have the heart, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
You say you wanted love, yeah, gave you that and more
Yeah, but when it came to trust we both fucked up
Talking 'bout I saw you with your side ho
I was looking for someone to ride for
You're bringing up problems I gave you, was only a milestone
Now we both waking up looking for missed calls and dial tones
Now I'm sick of dreaming 'bout you, now you sick of seeing my daughter
Her eyes look like mine, now I'm forced to pick sides

[Chorus]
Now you wish I was the one
Wish I was the one who couldn't sleep babe
Wish I was the one who couldn't eat babe
Wish I was the one who couldn't breathe without the other one and now baby
I'm the one who's supposed to be broken
Break me down and build me up
Wish that I could meet you half way
But I don't have the heart oh no yeah, don't have the heart, oh yeah

[Bridge]
You was supposed to have the first pick
And I don't go to church like you wish I did
I put us in this predicament
I wish you could believe me, crying ain't easy
Trust me baby I need you to hold me
I miss my friends
Netflix and chill at the crib
Mind, body and soul, you my rib

[Chorus]
Now you wish I was the one
Wish I was the one who couldn't sleep
Wish I was the one who couldn't eat
Wish I was the one who couldn't breathe without the other one, now you, you, you
I'm the one who's supposed to be broken
You're the one to break me down and build me up
Wish that I could meet you half way
But I don't have the heart, I don't have the heart, yeah oh
