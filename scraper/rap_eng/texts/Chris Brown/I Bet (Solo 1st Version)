[Chorus]
Shawty wanna leave with a nigga, I bet , '
'Cause she wanna be on TV with a nigga, I bet
Bet you never thought that she would cheat on you, nigga, I bet
Don't be mad at me
I pull that chopper out and squeeze on you niggas
No sympathy for you niggas

[Verse 1]
Hoe, shut the fuck up, miss me with the bullshit
Balling like a bitch, all my niggas hood rich
Bring some bitches to the crib, show 'em what the wood is
Your bitch look like Shanayay, nah-uh, oh my goodness
It's 500, that be the block
Then you see that ghetto bird when you hear the shots
Where the plug at? Tell him meet me at the docks
Sent the little homie through, it might be the cops
Hold up, I'm getting money, boy
Your girl want me cause I got them toys
Rari's and the Bentleys and Aventadors
Double decker buses and them private jets, I spend it on
Painted on the Maserati, look like it been shitted on
Make her lift her skirt up, if she nervous, I'm a pervert
I be in the pussy deep, a nigga fuckin' up her cervix
Leave the condoms on the bed, man, I do that shit on purpose
Cause I hope a nigga see it when he comin' home from work

[Chorus]
Shawty wanna leave with a nigga, I bet
'Cause she wanna be on TV with a nigga, I bet
Bet you never thought that she would cheat on you nigga, I bet
Don't be mad at me
I pull that chopper out and squeeze on you niggas
No sympathy for you niggas

[Verse 2]
Look, shawty told me she lived on rose crescent
Said her daddy was a blood
I bought a pistol from her old man
I carry it every where I go
You see me pull up on your block
A nigga bustin’ out the ghost, wassup
Club nights, we just tryna party
If them niggas acting stupid, my niggas gon’ go retarded
Bet I finish it, even if you niggas start it
Now you mad, ‘cause your bitch put her booty on the market
Well, now she up in my crib, licking my balls with her face on my dick
Know you hot, but you ain't gon’ do shit, nigga no you not
Now you mad at that bitch, ‘cause she a thot
Huh, this ain't nothing new to me, she gon drop that ass
Pop that ass, shake that booty to me
I’ma let the money do the talkin’, I ain't need to speak

[Chorus]
Shawty wanna leave with a nigga, I bet
'Cause she wanna be on TV with a nigga, I bet
Bet you never thought that she would cheat on you nigga, I bet
Don't be mad at me
I pull that chopper out and squeeze on you niggas
No sympathy for you niggas
