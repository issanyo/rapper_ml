[Intro]
Blaq Tuxedo

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I-I-I can be your knight in armor
You can be my Cinderella
Let me love you, hey, let me love you, hey
Let me love you, hey, ooh
Girl, I know your love was right
On the phone, we talk all night
If you ready, we can get away
Money ain't a thing, girl, you just work the place
Ooh, ooh, I got it like
Ooh, ooh, I got it like
Ooh, I-I-I-I got it like
Girl, I know your love was right
On the phone, we talk all night
If you ready, we can get away
Money ain't a thing, girl, you just work the place

[Verse 1]
(Listen player)
She the bomb like tick tick, eat it like a pig
Gotta get a dyke chick, heard that her head sick
Around the world I done been, no Affleck
And you can come and join me, be my first round draft pick
A true queen out the deck, no contract
And if you with the hatin' go to H-E-double hockey sticks
I-i-it's official, I'ma stamp it like a post office
Ge-ge-get it wet, Coast Guard
Ba-ba-baby, I'm the girls, them suga, smokin' on the towel, boy
I ain't no Trey Songz but I'll make you say ahh
All aboard, take a ride in my lil' boat (oh)
And I'll knock every wave in your lil' coast
To keep our freaky secrets close like a love note
And I'm married to my money, that's official
Don't want your lady but she's bad like Medusa
She's my war and I protect her, oh, it's on

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I-I-I can be your knight in armor
You can be my Cinderella
Let me love you, hey, let me love you, hey
Let me love you, hey, ooh
Girl, I know your love was right
On the phone, we talk all night
If you ready, we can get away
Money ain't a thing, girl, you just work the place
Ooh, ooh, I got it like
Ooh, ooh, I got it like
Ooh, I-I-I-I got it like
Girl, I know your love was right
On the phone, we talk all night
If you ready, we can get away
Money ain't a thing, girl, you just work the place

[Verse 2]
(Aight, look)
Baby all that, Kel call Keenan
Text T-Pain, bet he won't believe it
Jimmy, Jimmy Choo pumps, feet so spoiled
Heard you love to make it rain and you need it like soil
What's the word, mama? Listen hurr mama
Man actin' sus, kick him to the curb, mama
Yeah, you want the bomb, you lookin' at Osama
Cre-cremate the pussy, leave it in the urn, mama
Just playin', we can live it up
Do it B.I.G., bring your fam, call it clumps
Ass fatter than a SWAT pasta with the mumps
Prolly thinkin' this a dream 'cause my love got you drunk
On-only time she quiet, she breakin' down a blunt
She say she got my back, and she'll never front
All state bounce, she's in good hands
Time to put the sheet on her, Ku Klux Klan

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I-I-I can be your knight in armor
You can be my Cinderella
Let me love you, hey, let me love you, hey
Let me love you, hey, ooh
Girl, I know your love was right
On the phone, we talk all night
If you ready, we can get away
Money ain't a thing, girl, you just work the place
Ooh, ooh, I got it like
Ooh, ooh, I got it like
Ooh, I-I-I-I got it like
Girl, I know your love was right
On the phone, we talk all night
If you ready, we can get away
Money ain't a thing, girl, you just work the place

[Outro: Chris Brown]
I can be your knight in armor
You can, you can, you can be my Cinderella
Girl, I know your love was right
On the phone, we talk all night
If you ready, let me love you, hey
Let me love you
If you ready, let me love you, hey
Let me love you, hey
