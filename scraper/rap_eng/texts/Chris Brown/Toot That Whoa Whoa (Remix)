[Verse 1: Prince Chrishan]
All my niggas thuggin’, all my niggas thuggin'
If it ain't the money, it ain’t no discussion (no discussion)
Running with the ruger since a little boy (little boy)
Slick Rick the ruler with the jewelry, boy (jewelry, boy)
I don't know a nigga that can take my place (hey)
I don't entertain what these niggas say (yeah)
Pull up in that all white Minnesota toy ('sota toy)
That's the new Ferrari, you can hear the roar
