[Verse 1]
There's star in the palm of my hand and I think it's yours
You don't want it then I'll understand, you deserve much more
When I brought it, down from the sky you almost forgot it
It was new back when you gave a damn, whatcha need, I'll go and get it

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I don't come back, girl, your love was worth it
That's the one thing I know
And if I don't make it back
Girl, remember that, that I said I'd go, baby

[Chorus]
Girl, your love is so hard, but it takes me so far
But I don't care I'll go, oh
If I don't make it home, at least now you know
Girl, for you I'll go

[Verse 2]
Got my heart in the palm of your hand, now you're good, that's yours
If you don't want it, I won't understand cause I came so far
When you tossed it, took forever to find the place where you lost it
Now you're gone with my heart out the door, home is here girl, don't forget it

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you don't come back, girl, this love was worth it
That's the one thing I know yeah, yeah yeah yeah
If you don't make it back
Girl, remember that, that I said I'd go for you, oh

[Chorus]
Girl, your love is so hard, but it takes me so far
But I don't care I'll go, oh
If I don't make it home, at least now you know
That for you I'll go
