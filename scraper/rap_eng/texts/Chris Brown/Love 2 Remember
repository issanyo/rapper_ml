[Intro]
Why do we argue?
Why do we scream?
I wish it was better
I don't want you to leave

[Verse 1]
I'm tryna make peace babe, these tears run down my face
So I close my eyes, but we both cry
And you say this is it baby, baby
She said she tired of my shit, she wanna quit
The funny thing, I've been good to her, not doing shit
But she think that I've been fucking with Keisha, Latoya and Lisa
Dirty Diana, Nicki and Amber
Got to be out of your damn mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what's the deal with you?
There’s something wrong, I feel it too
We hardly see each other and now you wanna talk about space
You changed, you wanna leave me now but you can’t tell me

[Chorus]
Why do we argue? Why do we scream?
I wish it was better, I don’t want you to leave
So sick and tired of drinkin' this bottle
Contemplating the pill overdose
I think this one shot will stop the pain
And now I'm sleeping, I just wanted you to love me

[Verse 2]
Got myself on speed dial, 9-1-1
I got a hole in my heart, one bullet and a gun
Ready for the pills, running out of time, sitting here waiting, just to say goodbye to my love
Farewell, I'm gonna miss you, you’ll always go back to the day when I said girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what's the deal with you?
There’s something wrong, I feel it too
We hardly see each other and now you wanna talk about space
You changed, you wanna leave me now but you can’t tell me

[Chorus]
Why do we argue? Why do we scream?
I wish it was better, I don’t want you to leave
So sick and tired of drinking this bottle
Contemplating the pill overdose
I think this one shot will stop the pain
And now I'm sleeping, I just wanted you to love me

[Outro]
This is a love to remember, yeah, this is a love to remember
Don’t cry, don’t cry, we’ll meet again once upon a time
This is a love to remember, yeah, this is a love to remember
Don’t cry, don’t cry, we’ll meet again once upon a time
