[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I just wanna take my time
As stingy as you are, think you're ready?
Girl, I wanna do you right
I just wanna give you what you need
Baby girl, take my time, oh, oh
Just do me, do you right

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Girl, when you step all wet from out the shower baby
I want you to lay down, just stay naked, now I'm staring for an hour babe, oh
I got your back up against the wall, I got strength, won't let you fall
When I make you bloom like a flower babe, babe

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I just wanna take my time
As stingy as you are, think you're ready?
Girl, I wanna do you right
I just wanna give you what you need
Baby girl, take my time, oh, oh
Just do me, do you right

[Verse 2: Tank]
It ain't your fault you ran out of power babe
Cause I've been kissing and licking on you everywhere, oh
I wanna hear you scream my name and girl you know, no way
Baby it's cool I'll wait, for you baby, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I just wanna take my time
As stingy as you are, think you're ready?
Girl, I wanna do you right
I just wanna give you what you need
Baby girl, take my time, oh, oh
Just do me, do you right

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tank]
I just wanna take my time
As stingy as you are, think you're ready?
Girl, I wanna do you right
I just wanna give you what you need
Baby girl, take my time, oh, oh
Just do me, do you right
I just wanna take my time
As stingy as you are, think you're ready?
Girl, I wanna do you right
I just wanna give you what you need
Baby girl, take my time, oh, oh
Just do me, do you right
