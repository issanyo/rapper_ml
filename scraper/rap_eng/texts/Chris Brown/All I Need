[Intro: Wale]
There's been so many, it's been dope
My vibe Prosecco like a retired rep though
I've been official and been official
Let's go

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I'm just looking for a good time tonight
Weed and champagne, it's a good time right
They be acting like they know about it
If they hating, then you know you got it, fuck everybody

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All I need in this crazy world is me and my baby girl
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ain't nobody else, you make me feel like I can save the world

[Verse 3: Wale]
Beauty's an understatement, THC concentrated
Can't see without cameras until I get to them numbers baby
Where the fuck is the Kodak?
Pull up in something flagrant and foreign, say "Hello Borat"
Very nice, DMV that for life
See me, see hood and CB, this easy as apple pie, that's right
Make shit from most right, lame niggas goodbye
This Black Pyramid, I need a Cleopatra tonight
Then it's face down, ass up
She insist on missionary cause I'm handsome
Then it's ass down, hers up
Ow scratched up, you acting like this your first nut

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All I need in this crazy world is me and my baby girl
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ain't nobody else, you make me feel like I can save the world
All I need, all I need

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
All I need, all I need
All I need, all I need, all I need, all I need

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
Click clack, boom, I be on my pussy murder shit
Particular, vehicular, I'm tryna swerve the bitch
In them foreign cars, doors go up, you ain't heard of shit
I hit it, she throw it like Serena in the tournament
Dimmin' all the lights, get that pussy, then it's curtains bitch
Put her on a flight, private jet, yeah she earned it
Pole in my room, brought a stripper bitch to teach her tricks
You know light skinned niggas still running shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All I need in this crazy world is me and my baby girl
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ain't nobody else, you make me feel like I can save the world
All I need, all I need
All I need in this crazy world is me and my baby girl
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
All I need, all I need
All I need, all I need, all I need, all I need

[Outro: Wale]
All I need in this world of sin
Is a lover, freak, wife and friend
