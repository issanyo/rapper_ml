[Verse 1]
You say keep her close
It’s too good to be with you
But I'm a dreamer
It’s too good to be real
Feels too good to be real
Roll my weed up, I gotta light

[Chorus]
There's some magic here (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Nobody's here with me, but me and you
It's perfect, smoke this
One more, baby, take it
Take it, smoke this

[Verse 2]
You say, once in a lifetime (Woah)
Well I say, girl, you're wrong
Something special (Oh-oh-oh)
Your face (Oh-oh)
I see something gorgeous
But I love getting faded

[Chorus]
There's some magic here oh-oh-oh (yeah, yeah, oh)
Nobody's here, but me and you (but me, but you and me)
It's perfect, baby, would you smoke this?
Just one more baby take it
Take it, take this (take this, smoke this)

[Chorus]
There's some magic here (Yeah, yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Nobody's here with me, but me and you (But you and me)
It's perfect, baby, would you smoke this?
Just one more, baby, take it
Take it, smoke this (Take it, take it)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There's some magic here (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You don't have to worry, 'cause nobody's here, but me and you
It's perfect, smoke this
One more, baby, take it
Take it, smoke this

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, I'm, oh
Oh-oh (It's perfect)
So, smoke this
One more, baby, take it
Smoke this
