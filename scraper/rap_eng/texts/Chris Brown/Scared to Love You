[Intro]
You got my heart, one and only
You got my trust so baby I'mma never let you down, woah
You're the one I need right now and your body is like wow
Everything just, everything just, everything just revolves around you

[Verse 1]
Ey come baby tell me what's up, you already know me girl, what's up
Ain't nobody here baby, it's just us and I'm just in, understand?
Girl I hope you're ready for the backseat action, got a taxi driver
I'll go any, girl I'll go every and girl I'll go anywhere with you

[Chorus]
Hey little love of mine
Can you spend a little more time with me baby?
I'm sure it'll be just fine
I'm not scared of loving you, I know baby

[Verse 2]
I don't care if your heels was made to walk in, girl gon' and take 'em off
I just wanna see you shake it, show a little skin, she said "I don't need to break it off"
So baby tell me, just what you wanna do now?
Cause I'll do any baby, I'll do every, I'll do anything for you

[Chorus]
Hey little love of mine
Can you spend a little more time with me baby?
I'm sure it'll be just fine
I'm not scared of loving you, I know baby
