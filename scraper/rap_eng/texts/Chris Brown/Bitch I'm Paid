[Intro]
K.E. on the Track
Yeah, haha, what?
Big shit, nigga
Haha, a hunnid or nothin'
Look, leggo

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say
She drop it on the floor and this money on the way
I say I'm, bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say
When you talk about that money, pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake
I say I'm, bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say
When the media talk about a nigga, smoke a blunt and roll up
Bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say (Look)
Livin' every fuckin' day like Judgement Day (Haha, ha, leggo)

[Verse 1]
I'm grindin' hard
But this money is callin' the shots
Got that big bank and this money long
And they stickin' they hand in my pot
With this Rolex, I bowflex
And my ears lookin' like Rocky
Better, better gon' head with that bullshit
'Cause I am somethin' you not
Better put your hands up if you wanna knuckle up
Take you for that ride, better buckle up
I got bands up for them dancers
When your shift is up, you come fuck with us
It’s a real nigga affair
'Cause them real niggas in here
Girl, better get up on me
'Fore a real nigga disappear
Got that Ghost door outside waitin'
Snap, snap, popo, cameras hatin'
Got my shades on
Nigga wanna talk that shit, I'm elevatin'
All my ladies celebratin'
If my bitches catch you slippin', you’ll be tied up in my basement
No location, that shit cray (Haha)
What you mean I'm big headed?
Oh, you talkin' 'bout my dick
What you mean that shit petty?
Oh, you talkin' 'bout my bitch
Talkin' 'bout I'm a light bright
You talkin' 'bout my wrist
Didn't know I could rap right?
Nah, but this that shit

[Chorus]
Bitch, bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say
She drop it on the floor and this money on the way
I say I'm, bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say
When you talk about that money, pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake
I say I'm, bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say
When the media talk about a nigga, smoke a blunt and roll up
Bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say (Yeah, haha, look)
Livin' every fuckin' day like Judgement Day (Haha, ha, leggo)

[Verse 2]
Y'all not cooperatin' (Yeah)
My occupation is to occupy all these nations (Yeah)
Communication with your lady in my new Mercedes (Yeah)
I'm ridin' 'round with my top down
Too much smoke up in her weave
Better let that shit air out (Yikes!)
Better give me that nana
Call me dada and I'll be papa
I'ma be your cookie monster
Gold ticket like a nigga Willy Wonka
But you know a nigga really want you
Bang, bang, I do the damn thing
But then I hit it again and make a bitch roll up (Hahaha)
I own this necklace
Matter of fact all of this my shit
That’s my ring, that’s my Range
I'm about to make your bitch my bitch
I said money ain't never no issue
Cryin' niggas gon' get a tissue
It was crazy in the club last night
And nigga, we ain't seen you

[Chorus]
Bitch, bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say
She drop it on the floor and this money on the way
I say I'm, bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say
When you talk about that money, pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake
I say I'm, bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say
When the media talk about a nigga, smoke a blunt and roll up
Bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say
Livin' every fuckin' day like Judgement Day (Ha, leggo)

[Outro]
Liquor got me tipsy, I'm slow leanin'
Lookin' at her titties, she high beamin'
She lookin' at my chain but, all she really want is my semen
I'ma let her get it, right on the face, clear it up like Noxzema
You know a nigga like me, I can do a rap song any day of the week
Singin' ass nigga, tatted up though, ladies know I'm a freak
You know I'm a freak, you know I'm a freak
It's Breezy, bitch, yikes, a nigga cold on the beat
Yikes, cold as ice
Yikes, huh, Breezy
