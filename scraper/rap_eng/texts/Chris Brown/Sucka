[Verse]
How could I allow her to do it?
They say a man ain't suppose to cry
Right now I feel so foolish (Oh, why)
Thought I could trust her
I guess I thought wrong
So many times I played the fool
I guess I was the dummy all alone (Damn)

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess I had it coming 'cause I'm famous
She was in it for the money, I can't blame her
She tried to break my pockets, but broke my heart
Yeah she tried, guess I'm not that stupid after all
And my baby stuck in her ways
Girl, it's fine, what a nice try
At least we had a good time
Bitch, goodbye

[Chorus]
You don't even see her, when you come across her
You give her that alley-oop, think that bitch gon' cross ya
And if you got a lot of money, that pussy gon' cost ya
Don't trust that hoe, don't be a sucka

[Post-Chorus]
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
That's all she wants
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
That's all she wants
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
Don't trust that hoe, don't be a sucka
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
That's all she wants
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
That's all she wants
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
Don't trust that hoe, don't be a sucka

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess I had it coming 'cause I'm famous
She was in it for the money, I can't blame her
She tried to break my pockets, but broke my heart
Yeah she tried, guess I'm not that stupid after all
And my baby stuck in her ways
Girl, it's fine, what a nice try
At least we had a good time
Bitch, goodbye

[Chorus]
You don't even see her, when you come across her
You give her that alley-oop, think that bitch gon' cross ya
And if you got a lot of money, that pussy gon' cost ya
Don't trust that hoe, don't be a sucka

[Post-Chorus]
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
That's all she wants
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
That's all she wants
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
Don't trust that hoe, don't be a sucka
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
That's all she wants
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
That's all she wants
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
Don't trust that hoe, don't be a sucka
