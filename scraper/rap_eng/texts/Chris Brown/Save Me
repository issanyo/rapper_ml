[Intro]
Lord, we come to you
Asking you for the strength and the guidance
To be man enough to protect our children
'Til the day that we die, Amen

[Verse 1]
Devotion to that higher ground
Each day by day, he's slowly fading
It's like we can't hear the sound
So I gotta be innovated
He sending all over the world now
We need to start making changes
The light is covered up by the clouds
And my life's constantly raining

[Pre-Chorus]
When I think about the things you've done for me
And how you made me see, truthfully
I ain't gon' do you wrong no
Don't let no one of us go because I know

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna save me
Gonna save me from the sins I've done
Nobody's gonna save me
Gonna save me 'cause it's all my fault
Nobody's gonna save me
Gonna save me from the belief I've lost
Nobody's gonna save me
Gonna save me, so I'm praying to you God

[Verse 2]
It's not safe to say it's over now
We're here, now see
Little bodies laying on the ground
It coulda been your baby
Is someone gonna help us out?
They need some food to eat
But there'll be brighter days
When we'll be saved
The Lord will send blessings

[Pre-Chorus]
When I think about the things you've done for me
And how you made me see, truthfully
I ain't gon' do you wrong no
Don't let no one of us go because I know

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna save me
Gonna save me from the sins I've done
Nobody's gonna save me
Gonna save me 'cause it's all my fault
Nobody's gonna save me
Gonna save me from the belief I've lost
Nobody's gonna save me
Gonna save me, so I'm praying to you God

[Outro]
Every step that we take from this day, oh Lord
We both hope that it's one of your directions
So take this song as a token of our affection
We both apologize, Amen
