[Verse 1]
If I asked to kiss ya
Would you say yes or turn and walk away, oh baby?
See I must admit, girl
Cause all the crazy things that go through my head, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
It seemed just like the perfect move at the time
For me to make you mine, girl, you sexy from head to toe
You said you think we should wait a while
And it might be hard but

[Chorus]
But I won't complain
You could've been anywhere else but you're here with me, oh yeah
We can travel to space and as long as I got you right here next to me, I'm straight
No, girl, I'll wait for you, yes I will, you know I said I'll wait for you

[Verse 2]
I just wanna love ya
Lord knows that I can't wait for the day
I said I must admit, girl
Baby, I swear I'll do whatever it takes to keep you here with me

[Pre-Chorus]
It seemed just like the perfect move at the time
For me to make you mine, girl, you sexy from head to toe
You said you think we should wait a while
And it might be hard but

[Chorus]
But I won't complain
You could've been anywhere else but you're here with me, oh yeah
We can travel to space and as long as I got you right here next to me, I'm straight
No, girl, I'll wait for you, yes I will, you know I said I'll wait for you

[Bridge]
It's been awhile and we both know that I've been patient girl
Cause you ain't been tryna give it up, no

[Chorus]
But I won't complain
You could've been anywhere else but you're here with me, oh yeah
We can travel to space and as long as I got you right here next to me, I'm straight
No, girl, I'll wait for you, yes I will, you know I said I'll wait for you
