[Verse 1: K. Michelle]
Ass shots, real or fake
That ass gon' jiggle for him anyway
Ain't fuckin' with me on your best day
I don't like you, but I love how your man lick the plate
I know you seen what I post today
Diamonds up like Jay, crazy on my Kanye
'Cause I need someone to do, somewhere to play
Fuck it, I might Uber me a jet today (yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: K. Michelle & Chris Brown]
They don't like me, what they say?
I hear rumors, I feel the hate
But I'm okay, I'm young and rich
I be high all day (ooh)

[Chorus: K. Michelle & Chris Brown]
Either way, I'm gon' be straight, damn, my life is great (woo)
Sleeping good at night, in the morning eating eggs and steak (yeah, yeah)
Sleep or awake, I'm gon' get this money either way

Either way, I'm gon' brazy with my braids, where my shades?
See the face? All the diamonds blinding, that's why your bitch came
And she stay, she ain't scared that I got felonies
Love a country nigga, with the pot, teachin' hoes my new recipe
She never kiss and tell, throw a coin in a wishing well
You buy your bitch Michael Kors
I'm buying her Richard Mille
My girl got booty like K. Michelle
If I pay her bills, she gon' pay my bail
Paper trail, nigga, oh well
Louboutin, shawty toenails
I turn your bitch into a cokehead, I don't give a fuck (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 4: Yo Gotti]
Win or lose, either way I'ma be straight (I am)
I got my bag out the street, and I make sure we ate (hey)
When your feelings is shitty, it can go either way (yeah)
I come from the bottom, I run up a check
Leave the posters in the hood, sayin' dope in the hood everyday
Ayy, take a ratchet put some swag on 'em (ratchet)
Shawty thick, got a ass on her
Loyalty, can't put a tag on 'em
Either way I blow a bag on her (yeah)
Hood man, said that money change 'em
Either way, you want my pants, homie
Due respect, me think this shit a game
Either way, I'm on your ass, homie

[Verse 5: O.T Genasis]
I got a whole lot of paper (cash)
I got a whole lot of haters
Nigga, be drippin' in sauce (swag)
I got a whole lot of flavor
Hop in the Benz, her and her friends
Suckin' dick, all of 'em 10's
I want to win, you want my money to end
See through you, just like a lens
My bitch perfect
Her body cursive (thick)
Her stomach hidin'
Her thighs churches
Lookin' thick, baller crisp
Took a trip, took a brick
Haters sick, suck a dick
Fuck 'em rich, I'm the shit, bitch
