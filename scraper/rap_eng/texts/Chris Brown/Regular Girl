[Verse 1: Tyga]
Picture life in the movie frame
Smiles in your face but everybody fake
Tryna claim a role, acting on the stage
The world wanna show and we all the play
Just to say, why didn't you want me yesterday?
I blacked out, got some change, now they feeling me
Couple chains, gold chains on, Mr T
They see me low key so nigga don't bother me
I wanna relax with some time, all just for me
Cause lately I been meeting girls, chasing me
Wanted the spotlight, damn, she spotted me
Dang you bad baby, let me tell you one thing

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
You got it, I like how you flaunt it and I need it, I really, really want it
Can I get, oh, your love?
Girl, I'm on it, I'm really, really on it 'til morning, I be up in the morning
What I gotta do to meet you? I just want this

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I want a regular girl, want a regular girl, want a regular girl
I want a regular girl, want a regular girl, want a regular girl
I want a regular girl, want a regular girl, want a regular girl
I want a regular girl, when I get home, yeah

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
The fame don't mean nothing, neither does the money
I just want my friend right here with me
The light will fade away, no matter how hard I grind
Today ain't the day, so I'm just gonna live my life
All day long, same shit different video
All them silly games, I don't wanna play no more

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
You got it, I like how you flaunt it and I need it, I really, really want it
Can I get, oh, your love?
Girl, I'm on it, I'm really, really on it 'til morning, I be up in the morning
What I gotta do to meet you? I just want this

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I want a regular girl, want a regular girl, want a regular girl
I want a regular girl, want a regular girl, want a regular girl
I want a regular girl, want a regular girl, want a regular girl
I want a regular girl, when I get home, yeah
