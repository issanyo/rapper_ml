[Intro: The Game & Lil Wayne]
Me and Tune' just got two twin Ferraris
Like fuck the ceilin'
Two ounces in my double cup
This shit gon' kill me

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Fuck yo feelings, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Forget yo feelings

[Verse 1: The Game & Lil Wayne]
Your bitch outside my section pointin', "I'm with them niggas, yeah"
Is that Drizzy, bitch? Yeah, I'm with Nicki like yeah
And these bitches be tellin' they niggas I'm crazy
Don't fuck with that nigga, he went at Jay-Z
And he went at Curtis, now he Patrick Swayze
Every night I got your bitch in my section
I do it at Liv and I do it at Toxic
Do it at Supper, I do it at Dream
No, we ain't at Houston, but I got that Rocket, go
And I'm feelin' nice, somebody mixed my pills right
And I'm gettin' all this money, and it's fucked up Trinidad lost his deal right, haha
No ceilings, got the drophead for my children
Dr. Dre just made a billion and he sent me to tell all you niggas, man, fuck yo feelings

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Haha, look, any bitch that I'm with, she just hop in the whip and she get an upgrade
Pimpin' is pimpin', I make a commission, make that pussy pay
M-my dick like a chopper, I load it then cock it then bust on your face
We know that you pussy, my nigga, we know you ain't catchin' no fades
Bulletproof windows is tinted, my nigga, while all your shit rented
You should rent it from me 'cause I crash as soon as I spin it
House party bring all the bitches, don't bump the DJ, my nigga
You really care 'bout this bitch, my dick all up in your feelings

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings

[Verse 3: The Game & Lil Wayne]
Started with documents, reincarnated Pac and Big
How do you that think I got your bitch?
I am 2Pacalypse, got more winners than Popovich
Yeah, my bitch will pop a bitch
Pull up like skrrt, now your bitch out her skirt
Nigga, fuck yo feelings
I made her twerk now she sellin' my work
Nigga, fuck yo feelings
Started with Hannah Montana hoes
Now I'm fuckin' all of Nick Cannon hoes
I made her go down down, baby
But I don't speak no country grammar though, I got the antidote
I know some Fruit town niggas that'll bust your head like cantaloupe
You pull out your camera, my cannon blow
2014 Hannibal, lil nigga, fuck yo feelings

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings, nigga, fuck yo feelings
Fuck yo feelings, fuck yo feelings, yeah
I fuck yo bitches, I fuck yo bitches, yeah
Fuck yo niggas, nigga, fuck yo niggas, yeah
Fuck them niggas, fuck them niggas, chopper
Fuck them niggas, fuck them niggas, yeah
