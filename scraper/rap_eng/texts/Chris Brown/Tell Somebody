[Intro]
Yeah, wassup baby?
Lemme ask you a question, don't tell nobody
Think you got my love, making love
Watching the sunrise, while Chris sings us a verse

[Verse 1]
Hey there pretty lady, saw you at the bar and I was mesmerised
You might think it sounds crazy, but I ain't never been a man to lie
Girl I don't think you're ready, cause you can't keep a secret very well
And hey girl if you let me, I might give you something to go and tell

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey yeah I can just see it now
Tryna hold it in
Tryna keep it down
But you keep screaming

[Chorus]
You're gonna wanna tell somebody
You're gonna wanna tell everybody
You're gonna wanna tell somebody
You're gonna wanna tell everybody

[Verse 2]
And turn the lights down low girl cause you know that I be waiting on you
Won't you hold me close girl? I'mma show you I got something prove
So go ahead tell all your girls, yeah you tell 'em that I put it down
They all gon' want a piece of this so you better keep it to yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey yeah I can just see it now
Tryna hold it in
Tryna keep it down
But you keep screaming

[Chorus]
You're gonna wanna tell somebody
You're gonna wanna tell everybody
You're gonna wanna tell somebody
You're gonna wanna tell everybody
You're gonna wanna tell somebody
You're gonna wanna tell everybody
You're gonna wanna tell somebody
You're gonna wanna tell everybody

[Bridge]
Just tell them how good it is, oh yeah
And how it makes you feel oh and just tell 'em, gon' girl tell it all
How I'm just pulling your hair from the back and I got you shaking
Girl you better tell 'em all that I'm just a sexy, sexy, freaky freak, just go and tell 'em that I put it down, oh

[Chorus]
You're gonna wanna tell somebody
You're gonna wanna tell everybody
You're gonna wanna tell somebody
You're gonna wanna tell everybody
You're gonna wanna tell somebody
You're gonna wanna tell everybody
You're gonna wanna tell somebody
You're gonna wanna tell everybody

[Outro]
And turn the lights down low girl
Cause you know that I be waiting on you
Won't you hold me close girl?
I'mma show you I got something prove
