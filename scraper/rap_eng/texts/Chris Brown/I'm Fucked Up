[Intro: Kevin McCall]
Cyeah, it's me and C Breezy
You know, okay, I'll admit it, we fucked up, ha

[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
I'm in the club, fuck about a service
I take my own shots, Texaco berence
Once your shawty see me and C Breezy, boy, it's curtains
Spilling Ace of Spades on the carpet, but it's on purpose
My house look like a circus, dick look like a serpent
This look like a movie, one take, no rehearsing
She twerking it for this money so I feel like she deserve it
I'ma put my thing down, she took it and reverse it
Like I miss it, I'm pissy like I got a weak bladder
Tipsy off this Cristy, nigga, it don't even matter
Boy, I'm loco, cuckoo
Call me Sub Zero 'cause I'm so cold
Ha, you see that booty? She could make a fortune
No wonder her body cold 'cause she drop dead gorgeous
You don't get it? You slower than a motherfucker
Dummy, I'm rolling so I'm on than a motherfucker

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
I'm fucked up, I'm brain dead
Walking round like the club like I don't know what day it is
I'm high, higher than a plane bitch
Walking round like the club like I don't know what day it is
Monday I be balling, Tuesday I be balling
Wednesday I be balling, man these bitches keep on coming
Thursday I be chilling, but Friday I be killing
Saturday and Sunday, that's the motherfucking weekend

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Look, yeah, 'cause I'm smoking super fire from my lighter (yeah)
I want her with the stripes cause I know that she a tiger (ow!)
Engine growling like a bitch so I pull up right beside her (look)
I tell her hop up in, upgrade, I supersize her (haha)
150 grand chain, what you doing, hoe?
Two girls in the bed, guess I'm 2-0
Gold wrappers, better wrap it like a tuna roll (yep)
Your body ain't bad, girl, you're beautiful (yikes)
My watch only cost your car note (yeah)
Three girls, your dog and a pack of smokes (ow!)
Ha, my roof wild, alligator, bitch (yeah)
I'm stunting in the club like I don't know what day it is
Yeah, these little mamas in pyjamas
And I'm in this club huh, and it feel like the Bahamas
Bad bitches in the front and the boom's right behind us
I'm super fucked up, hey I'm just being honest, yikes (look)

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
I'm fucked up, I'm brain dead
Walking round like the club like I don't know what day it is
I'm high, higher than a plane bitch
Walking round like the club like I don't know what day it is
Monday I be balling, Tuesday I be balling
Wednesday I be balling, man these bitches keep on coming
Thursday I be chilling, but Friday I be killing
Saturday and Sunday, that's the motherfucking weekend
I'm fucked up, I'm brain dead
Walking round like the club like I don't know what day it is
I'm high, higher than a plane bitch
Walking round like the club like I don't know what day it is
Monday I be balling, Tuesday I be balling
Wednesday I be balling, man these bitches keep on coming
Thursday I be chilling, but Friday I be killing
Saturday and Sunday, that's the motherfucking weekend
