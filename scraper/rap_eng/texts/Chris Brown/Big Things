[Verse 1: Ester Dean]
I does my shit
And I'ma have them runningup on this
I put that bank up in the air like this
All the guys say I'm that chick
They wanna hit it, they can't
I ain't never messing with no lames
Right now, I'ma pop that thing
Let them know my name 'cause I'm in this thang

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ester Dean]
I'm looking for a thug at the bar who drive a big car (ayy)
'Cause I'm kinda into big things (ayy)
Popping bottles of Patron, do it all night long (ayy)
But a bitch still good with a body (ayy)
Gotta get some new tracks and they cost a lot of stacks (ayy)
So we gotta spend it all up on me (ayy)
So where the big things at-at-at-at?
So where the big things at-at-at-at?

[Verse 2: Ester Dean]
You see me
In the VIP popping bottles
But do you really know me?
It don't matter 'cause I'm throwing them dollars
At the end of the night, I be so turned up
You already know what's in my cup
Hands in the air like I don't give a fuck
I be the life of the party
And your man gon' buy me nice things
He even let me keep the keys to the range
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
'Cause he know I'ma FIU it
Gon' fuck it up, girl, watch me do it
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ester Dean]

So we gotta spend it all up on me (ayy)
So where the big things at-at-at-at?
So where the big things at-at-at-at?

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Yeah, big wheels so you know I'm 'bout to ride around
My kicks ill with my motherfuckin' collar down
Burberry, rockin' Louis and that Prada now
I'm on that new shit, your shit is outta style
I start my car, I don't even need a key for it
And when you drink, lil mama, gon' and deep throat it
Just free throw it, now that's a free shot
Dr. Dre 'cause I'm givin' her the detox
Your girl on me 'cause my money long
A beast in the sheets, call me King Kong
Hands in the air, somethin' like a sing-along
Simon says everybody wanna sing my song

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ester Dean]
