[Verse 1]
You disappear for days, you just go ghost
Where the hell do you go?
Are you in bed? With him instead?
We're tryna mend this, please let it out
Let that brutal honesty spill out your mouth
I already know what this is all about
I just need you to tell me the truth

[Chorus]
Did you let somebody hold on to you?
The way I would? The way I would?
Did you let, somebody hold on to you?
The way I would? The way I would?
Did you let -

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Did you let somebody hold on to you?
Did you let somebody hold on to you?
Did you let somebody hold on to you?

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Your eyes say words your lips will never say
[?]
Somebody ought to try you, I'm trying to find you
I know we're tryna mend this, let it out
Let that brutal honesty spill out your mouth
I already know what this is all about
I just need you to tell me the truth

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Did you let somebody hold on to you? (please girl not the way)
The way I would, the way I would (no, oh)
Did you let, somebody hold on to you?
The way I would, the way I would
Did you let -

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Did you let -
Did you let somebody hold on to you?
Did you let somebody hold on to you?
Did you let somebody hold on to you?
