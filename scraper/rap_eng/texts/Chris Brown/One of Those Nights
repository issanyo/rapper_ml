[Intro: Chris Brown]
Just in case if you forgot, we go by the Runners
Okay, wassup, you feeling alright? I'm good, feels like one of those nights

[Pre-Hook: Chris Brown]
I got my crew with me and I brought my swagger too
When you hit the door, you better check your attitude
Okay okay you do you your thing, I ain't mad at you
But I'm on a different level, check your latitude

[Hook: Chris Brown & will.i.am]
I think it might be one of those nights
It feels like one of those nights
Yeah, it's gotta be one of those nights
Oh yeah, it feels like one of those
Nights, nights, nights, nights, nights, nights, nights, nights, nights

Nights, nights, nights, nights, nights, nights, nights, nights, nights
Oh yeah it feels like one of those nights
Oh yeah, watch me as I elevate
I got my peoples with me, we about to celebrate tonight
Night, night, night, night, night

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & will.i.am]
Yeah, okay them other clubs ain't jumpin', I am bored of it, I'm bored of it

More drinks are on the way and yes, I ordered it, I ordered it
And you don't have to pay 'cause I afforded it, okay
I keep the party fuckin' jumpin' 'cause I'm rockin' funky beats
I be up inside this bitch, just playin' heat to melt ya feet
All the ladies gettin' crazy to that big fat bass
When I step inside this bitch It's like I own this fuckin' place, I'm in the house

[Hook: Chris Brown & will.i.am]

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & will.i.am]
Look, I got them bottles of that ooey, super model, super groupies

With all this smoke and all these lights, so turnt up, it's one of them nights
401, that's what I like, but I gotta know if you're fuckin', right
My man CB is on the floor, just rockin' 'em, just rockin' 'em
Pop lockin' and shock and shufflin' on top of 'em, on top of 'em

In the club just chillin' with them ladies and them, yo

[Pre-Hook: Chris Brown & will.i.am]
