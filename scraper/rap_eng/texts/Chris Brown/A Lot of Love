[Intro]
A lot of love
A lot of love
A lot of love
A lot of love

[Verse 1]
Feels like the world is on your shoulders
Don't let 'em get you down
Through all the prejudice and violence
Your heart still can smile, you gotta go
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
And all the pain will go away, starting today

[Chorus]
It's time to help each other try
You can do it all it takes is, a lot of love
I need it, a lot of love
'Cause I'm giving, a lot of love
Yeah, a lot of love
A lot of love

[Verse 2]
Things are gonna be the way that they should be
With all the children running freely, no more war on TV
Open your heart and then you'll finally succeed
Hey, and everyone will finally be free

[Chorus]
It's time to help each other try
You can do it all it takes is, a lot of love
I need it, a lot of love
'Cause I'm giving, a lot of love
Yeah, a lot of love
A lot of love
