[Hook]
Throw your hands up high, throw your hands up high, I, oh I
Can you rock on with it? Clap on with it? I, oh I
Can't stop until it's over, bring your body closer
One more shot and it's over, I, oh I
Throw your hands up high, throw your hands up high
I see you caught up in the nightlife but everything about you is what I like
Oh baby, yeah, I threw this party just so you could dance with me
So we gonna party like it's no tomorrow

[Verse]
Arrested by your beauty, it's too good for me to resist
Your body's my playground, I'm ready for recess
And I can tell you just got your hair did
And if them bitches hatin', it ain't nothin' but a hair flip
I'm impressed by your body goin' all in
It's like an onamonapia sayin', "Oh shit"
A household name, you the baddest
And her love got me higher than addicts
I'll dress you in the best that money can buy
And money can't buy love, well shit, I'ma try
And I'll be any and everythin' you ask for
Baby girl, don't forget your passport

[Hook]
Throw your hands up high, throw your hands up high, I, oh I
Can you rock on with it? Clap on with it? I, oh I
Can't stop until it's over, bring your body closer
One more shot and it's over, I, oh I
Throw your hands up high, throw your hands up high
I see you caught up in the nightlife but everything about you is what I like
Oh baby, yeah, I threw this party just so you could dance with me
So we gonna party like it's no tomorrow
