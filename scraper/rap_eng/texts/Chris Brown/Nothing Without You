[Verse 1]
What's up with this? Used to kick it on the regular
But since the deal, you say my life has changed
I remember when we used to argue and it make no sense
Afterwards we'd make love again

[Pre-Chorus]
That was way before the videos
Way before the number 1 singles
On the radio, late night at the studio
When I was just CB, nobody knew me
But you were still the same now

[Chorus]
Being without you is like having nothing
It don't matter 'bout the money I spend
Got a million plus n my bank account
But it's nothing without you, nothing without you
I ain't been the same since you came in my life
And you're the only one to help me get right
And the way I'm feeling, girl, you need to know
Without you life is back to zero

[Verse 2]
Baby, just listen, girl, it's just a job so don't look at me different
Looking in your heart, girl, I know you're committed
And what I told you stands true
I've been down for you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
That was way before the videos
Way before the number 1 singles
On the radio, late night at the studio
When I was just CB, nobody knew me
But you were still the same now

[Chorus]
Being without you is like having nothing
It don't matter 'bout the money I spend
Got a million plus n my bank account
But it's nothing without you, nothing without you
I ain't been the same since you came in my life
And you're the only one to help me get right
And the way I'm feeling, girl, you need to know
Without you life is back to zero
