[Intro: Kid Ink]
(K-K-K-K-K-Mac)
Yeah
You know I gotta keep it 100, ooh
100, it's Kid Ink (the Alumni)

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Okay, I-I'm so fly, I feel like a swarm (go)
My time is money, ring the alarm (ooh)
Flip it to the ceilin', watch it do a somersault
Niggas say they run shit, I just see them runnin' out
D-Done it all, under the sun, ain't nothin' new (no)
Coming through the Westside, lookin' for the W (yeah, woo)
Still on that bullshit, I can't even utter you (go)
Money's all I talk, got a pocket full of honeydew
That'll make honey do a-anythin' I wanna
Take her by the head, Stone Cold Stunner, uh
Baby, rockin' like the wire
High out my mind, I'm a frequent flier (go)
It's CB and Tha Alumni
Got them hoes standin' at attention like a drumline
Keep it 100, I would take all of you combined
Kid Ink but I do it big, plus size (ooh)

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Kid Ink]
G-G-Get it how I live it, come faster than I could spend it (spend it)
Money to the ceilin', bitch, I'm in the buildin' (ceilin')
I'm a giant in the room full of midgets (tell 'em)
Money talks so don't say nothin' unless you talkin' business (woo)
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go

[Interlude: Kevin McCall]
Lemme count this money
One million, two million
Put this up for my new car, save that for my baby momma
And all you bums can keep the change

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
Beats I be servin', Saks Fifth splurgin'
Diamonds got so many cuts, call my jeweler the surgeon
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, label me the virgin
I'm hot b-b-burnin', like when you leave a perm in
Everywhere I go these hoes be diggin' in they purses for a Sharpie
'Cause they tryna get the autograph in cursive
Little bit of Coke mixed with a lot of bourbon
Got your boy leanin', sorry if my words slurrin'
Swervin' in that DB9 on purpose
The roof disappear, call it magic like Earvin Johnson
G-Get up off my johnson, no more ridin' dick
Shawty, this ain't magic mountain
I've been killin', killin' every song that I been spittin' on
And if I ain't spittin', bet it's somethin' that I written on
Can't even say it was a long road gettin' on
Only took a year and a half and now I'm shittin' on 'em

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Kid Ink]
G-G-Get it how I live it, come faster than I could spend it (spend it)
Money to the ceilin', bitch, I'm in the buildin' (ceilin')
I'm a giant in the room full of midgets (tell 'em)
Money talks so don't say nothin' unless you talkin' business (woo)
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Yeah, I got them bulletproof Ray Bans so haters never in my head
Money hungry good for me, yeah, I call it wheat bread
Ladies say I'm long strokin', yeah, thatâ€™s what she said
Crib like a castle so I'm fuckin' on that king spread
Hahaha, big ballin', fuck a loft
And money turn me on so I had to fuck it off
Skinny ass nigga's pockets lookin' so bulimic
And I never spill my drink, you can call me Tempur-Pedic
Allergic to the haters, addicted to the money
You askin' why I'm laughin' 'cause all of you niggas funny
And they call me Action Jackson 'cause every d-day I'm stuntin'
And I'm writin' hit songs like it's nothin'
So nigga, you buggin', frontin', what you think this is, hoe?
Paparazzi tryna pop me everywhere that Chris go
Never been no sucker, no lame, mad nigga
And your flow is more watered down than a drain, ass nigga

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Kid Ink]
G-G-Get it how I live it, come faster than I could spend it (spend it)
Money to the ceilin', bitch, I'm in the buildin' (ceilin')
I'm a giant in the room full of midgets (tell 'em)
Money talks so don't say nothin' unless you talkin' business (woo)
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go
