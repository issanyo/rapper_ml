[Intro]
Yeah, love

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know how I feel
Since you've been gone
Easy fall, I should've let go
'Cause everybody knows about you

[Chorus]
Everybody knows about you
Everybody knows about you
Everybody knows about you
And they shouldn't fucking know about you

[Verse 1]
You ain't used to know about nothing (oh no)
You were just a girl from the subs (subs)
You was with the three plate threeway (three)
How you 'posed to know 'bout love? (Love)
Hoes on hoes every day (every day)
How you think I slipped up? (Slipped)
All this he say, she say (he, he, he)
Damn it, I had enough

[Bridge]
Put you in the crib, that wasn't enough
Let you hit the mall and run that shit up
I'm the first one to put you in a foreign
Before me, you wasn't important
Now you actin' like you earned it
Go and smile for the camera
I hope that all this shit was worth it
I hope that all this shit was worth it, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know how I feel (you don't know)
Since you've been gone (you've been gone)
Easy fall, I should've let go (I should've let go)
'Cause everybody knows about you (knows about you)

[Chorus]
Everybody knows about you
Everybody knows about you
Everybody knows about you
And they shouldn't fucking know about you

[Verse 2]
Got a nigga stuck on stupid
I'm thinking I really might lose it
Walking away, it ain't easy
Leaving you is like leaving my music
Your homegirl's in my business
They're the same ones liking my pictures
Telling you to leave, you can do better
But they ain't got no niggas

[Bridge]
Put you in the crib, that wasn't enough
Let you hit the mall and run that shit up
I'm the first one to put you in a foreign
Before me, you wasn't important
Now you actin' like you earned it
Go and smile for the camera
I hope that all this shit was worth it
I hope that all this shit was worth it, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know how I feel (you don't know)
Since you've been gone (you've been gone)
Easy fall, I should've let go (I should've let go)
'Cause everybody knows about you (knows about you)

[Chorus]
Everybody knows about you
Everybody knows about you
Everybody knows about you
And they shouldn't fucking know about you
