[Intro]
Hands up in the air
I just want the
I just want the baddest bitch in the world
Right here on my lap
And I’mma hit this drink up like it’s my last
I’mma hit this night up like it’s my last
I’mma I’mma hit this ass up like it’s my last
Swear I’mma, swear I’mma do it like I, like I never had...

[Pre-Chorus]
Big ass bottles, big ice buckets
I work too hard to be ballin' on a budget
Me and my people do it big out in public
Cause if you don’t do it big bitch, you ain't doing nothing

[Chorus]
And I’mma hit this drink up like it’s my last
I’mma hit this night up like it’s my last
I’mma I’mma hit this ass up like it’s my last
Swear I’mma, swear I’mma do it like I
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
(I know y'all hatin' niggas. Leggo!)
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all

[Verse 1]
Yeah, me and Sean up in VIP
All these girls surround us
Got a bad bitch, black and Asian yeah she fine as fuck
And she don’t need no help, so I design her up
Juicy Couture no more, I Gucci sign her up
My credit card, hold dat! We take the bar with us
You ain't careful, we take your bitch in the car with us
Front of the club, all my cars look like Toys R Us
Better hold your girl hand, she looking at Breezy, trust me
And the others want Big Sean don
Got them Black goons with me, call me Farrakhan
And when you see me, throw that Westside up
Don't get confused I’m from VA but give that Westside love
Them fly dudes, Piru, be like wattup blood
Nipsey Hussle got that muscle, Snoop wattup cuz
My nigga Wiz know what it is, he love that Cali bud
Eastside high rise, wha!

[Chorus]
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all

[Pre-Chorus]
Big ass bottles, big ice buckets
I work too hard to be ballin' on a budget
Me and my people do it big out in public
Cause if you don’t do it big bitch, you ain't doing nothing

[Chorus]
And I’mma hit this drink up like it’s my last
I’mma hit this night up like it’s my last
I’mma I’mma hit this ass up like it’s my last
Swear I’mma, swear I’mma do it like I
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
