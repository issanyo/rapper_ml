[Verse 1]
I can't take my eyes off you
I think God made you for me, it's too good to be true
Didn't know my blessing and I learned a lesson, every man needs a queen, oh
Don't care how far, even if it's impossible, I'ma dream, reminiscing like

[Pre-Chorus]
I had you screaming like (oh yeah, oh yeah)
I promise I won't tell anybody about your Victoria Secrets (I won't, I won't)
Babe, if you say, "I do," baby, then I'm gonna show you what you mean to me (if you say, "I do")
I'ma take good care of you, trust me if you love me (you)

[Chorus]
It's like ring around the rosies, round and round (yeah)
Up and down like a rollercoaster
If you believe in us, you gotta trust me, baby (trust me)
Honestly, I can't wait for you to love me, baby
Don't ever doubt us, baby (trust me)
He don't have the answers for your soul (trust me)
Uplift your spirits, baby, hold you up (trust me)
You gotta trust that I won't fuck up our lives

[Verse 2]
I used to drive around the town and try to fuck up everybody
Talking to my baby, baby (oh hell nah)
I used to fuck up all the time, I was a liar switchin' stories up
Split personalities, know I drove you crazy
You need your space, I understand, you need your freedom, ha
Girl, you and I we 'posed to mean some'
Oh, me and you together we supposed to be one
Like day ones reminiscing like

[Pre-Chorus]
I had you screaming like (remember screaming like?)
I promise I won't tell anybody about your Victoria Secrets (Victoria Secrets, I won't, I won't)
Babe, if you say, "I do," baby, then I'm gonna show you what you mean to me (if you say, "I do," ha)
I'ma take good care of you, trust me if you love me (ha)

[Chorus]
It's like ring around the rosies, round and round (ow, yeah)
Up and down like a rollercoaster
If you believe in us, you gotta trust me, baby (if you believe in us you gotta, ooh, trust me)
Honestly, I can't wait for you to love me, baby (ooh)
Don't ever doubt us, baby (trust me, yeah)
He don't have the answers for your soul (trust me, yeah)
Uplift your spirits, baby, hold you up (hold you, baby, trust me)
You gotta trust that I won't fuck up our lives

[Verse 3]
You ain't like them other girls, huh?
You the type don't like diamonds and pearls, huh?
Now we fuckin', got you fightin' with your girls now
Bitches hating, wishin' I could fuck 'em first, huh?
Stay classy, party packin', I got the world, huh?
But I need you to trust me 'cause you my girl now
Don't wanna be that nigga that's gon' stress you out
Jokin' when we recite our wedding vows, this is what it's all about

[Chorus]
It's like ring around the rosies, round and round (yeah)
Up and down like a rollercoaster
If you believe in us you gotta trust me, baby (trust me)
Honestly, I can't wait for you to love me, baby
Don't ever doubt us, baby (trust me)
He don't have the answers for your soul (trust me)
Uplift your spirits, baby, hold you up (trust me)
You gotta trust that I won't fuck up our lives
