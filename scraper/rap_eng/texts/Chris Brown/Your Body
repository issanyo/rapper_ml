[Chorus]
To all my ladies think it’s about time
'Cause there's just one thing that’s on my mind
Your body, your body
To all my ladies looking so fine
There's just one thing that’s on my mind
Your body, your body
I want you girl

[Verse 1]
Fresh I am, yes I am
Skinny jeans on, I wear them
I'm such a little kid get my high chair then
But look at my watch and what's under my chin
So icy, your girl like me
True blood but I told her don't bite me
Forget the club, let me see what you liking
She said she wanna just do it like Nike
Well okay, let me put it down
I turn into a freak when nobody's around
When you under the sheets I know what's going down (down, down)
Yeah, and she'll want to leave me though she keep coming back
It must be the Louis bags and them hundred stacks
Or I make her cum fast like she running track
Magnum, Jimmy hat

[Chorus]
To all my ladies, think it’s about time
'Cause there's just one thing that’s on my mind
Your body, your body
To all my ladies looking so fine
There's just one thing that’s on my mind
Your body, your body
I want you girl

[Verse 2]
B-R-E-E-Z-Y
Hell of a guy, I'm fly, higher than high, Dubai I go
Private jets, nevertheless, I travel the globe
I'm ready to go but first let me call my P.O
Aha, baby take my hand in
And we can do anything except land in
Love it when you give it to me, speak it in Spanish
This week black girl, next week a Hispanic
Can't forget the white girls, that's right girls
Yeah the white girls
Hollywood price right bright light girls
And them hood hella drunk all night girls
That's what I like yeah
Oh you like cars? I got hot wheels
Haters mad, huh wonder how them cops feel
So let me cop a feel, aha right there
And we can disappear, David Copperfield

[Chorus]
To all my ladies think it’s about time
'Cause there's just one thing that’s on my mind
Your body, your body
To all my ladies looking so fine
There's just one thing that’s on my mind
Your body, your body
I want you girl
