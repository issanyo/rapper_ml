Intro:
Glowing, glowing your body is glowing x2

Verse 1:
Damn, your body's glowing
I can’t contain myself
Wanna be all over that body
And claim it for myself
Come & wrap your thighs all around my waist
Baby please on my cheek just a little taste

Have a seat on the couch
Somewhere you can’t be missin’
Let me stare at you, then close the gap
And babe, when we done our kissin’

Chorus:
How about we take it to the bed
And make some sweet love instead (of talking it out)
How about we take it to the bed
And make some sweet love instead (of yelling and screaming and pleading)
You know I’m not known for my patience
I want your body and its beautiful fragrance
So how about we take it to the bed
And make some sweet, sweet love

Verse 2:
From your head to your toes
I know your body knows
You want me too just as bad as I want you
And you think you’ll like it too
The way I'll hit your spot
Girl I'll get your heart unlocked
Say my name don't ever stop
Just one night is not enough
You know I don't mean no harm
I love to have you in my arms
Glowing brighter than the stars
Now this bed is hotter than on mars

Chorus:
How about we take it to the bed
And make some sweet love instead (of talking it out)
How about we take it to the bed
And make some sweet love instead (of yelling and screaming and pleading)
You know I’m not known for my patience
I want your body and its beautiful fragrance
So how about we take it to the bed
And make some sweet, sweet love

Break

Bridge:
Your body’s like my favourite holiday
Like the eve of something big & I can hardly wait
Get ready cause I'm gonna give it
You gonna get it
Remember how I did it
(Baby)

Chorus x2:
How about we take it to the bed
And make some sweet love instead (of talking it out)
How about we take it to the bed
And make some sweet love instead (of yelling and screaming and pleading)
You know I’m not known for my patience
I want your body and its beautiful fragrance
So how about we take it to the bed
And make some sweet, sweet love
