[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club going up, going up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club going up, going up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club going up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

[Verse 1: Trey Songz & Chris Brown]
Met her in the Chi-Town, she look like my old girl
She said they call her New New, I'm tryna fuck her in her home, girl, yeah, baby
I'm an 804 nigga, all these bitches know Trigga
I be on my own shit, niggas never owned shit, niggas be like, "Trigga, why don't you go and fuck your own bitch?"
I been gettin' rich, bitches on my dick
All up in my section, niggas say no flexin', alright
In the party with my niggas, we gon' get all the shine
VIP, pretty women, do this type of shit all the time
And my squad love the bricks, they love trappin' out the bando
Put a broad on the trip, make my bitch come hit you with a sample, she gon' bring the whip
Baby, do you do drugs? It's okay, it's alright
When we're up in this club, girl, we gon' fuck some shit up tonight

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
Niggas got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club going up, going up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club going up, going up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club going up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
Yeah, in the club with my strap, in case a nigga want to test me
My killers don't know how to act, snipe a nigga like Wesley
Pussy nigga this ain't what you want, my clique put up the middle fingers
I know your bitch she don't like waitin' long, I hit i,t then pass her to Trigga
Oh yeah, that girl, she with the shits though, she like to sip, she like to lean, baby
You know I told her how to hold up, oh yeah, keep it steady when you squeeze, baby
I'm in the party with my niggas, we gon' get all the shine
VIP pretty women, do this type of shit all the time
Never been the type to trick, fuck it, I'll throw a couple bands though
Just to watch you strip, play with that pussy like a banjo, bet that pussy squirt
Baby, I'm yours tonight, you gon' make me lose my mind
When you slow whine, show you right, girl, you got your women but tonight

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club going up, going up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club going up, going up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club going up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
