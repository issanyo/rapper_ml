[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Whipping and swerving, hitting them kerbs
Cos I'm on my way to come get ya
The way that you serving making me nervous
Nobody getting this feeling (feeling)
Where all them days when we can relate
Cos we be smoking the tree (yeah)
Know you been waiting, we'll be on top in a minute (minute)
I saw an end in the beginning (yeah)
You were bound to give me problems
Go back and forth like its tennis
You got everybody watching
But I see the stars when I'm in it
But I gotta leave when I'm finished
Gotta get back to my business
Money and fucking

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You must be lonely
You must be sad
Keep hitting up my phone and texting where I'm at
You be complicated
There's too many left
She's a real pain in the ass
But she still get the bed
When I'm mad I still want her, with me
Like the first day we met, first time we had sex babe
You just moved on to me
Don't be afraid, no, no
No more lying, no more cheating
No more spying for no reason
Cut it out, cut it out
You know how much I love you
And how much I need you

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
How much I need you
I be on my way to come see you, see you
You got a man we ain't equal, equal
I would never do you like he do, he do
Most of these girls be see through, see through
Why your home girls so evil, evil
Ain't none of your friends business
Ain't none of your friends business about what we do
