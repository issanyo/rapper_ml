[Intro]
My love, my love, my love
What would I do without my love?
My love, my love, my love
Listen

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been sensing
There's some problems going on with us, yeah, you and I
And baby, that's a problem
I take real serious, I can't lie
It gets to me
I don't know what to do but to tell you that I love you
And you know this 'cause I show it
Outsiders try to blow it but I can't let it happen, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's business ain't nobody's business
In other words, they don't know half of what I go through
To give, give you what you need
To be there, to be there for you and still do my thing
I'm talking 'bout music
'Cause it's what I gotta do to express how I really feel
See you write the songs, girl and I just do the singing
Without you I can't live
So heart to heart

[Chorus]
Baby, heart to heart
Baby, you're, you're the biggest part of my needs, girl
They can tell their stories
What you do for me, it gets too deep, girl
What I'd do for you, you'll never know
What they say to you, girl, let him go
You don't need him, you don't need him
You'd be better off hanging out with me
They try to break us up
They don't understand our love 'cause it gets to deep, girl

[Verse 2]
Check me, I know a way to make a bunch of people love me
If you were to leave me all by myself
Soon as we turn our way back, they hustle out
To tell someone else what's going on
Misery likes company but we're the only company
We need to be happy
And you know this 'cause I show it
Outsiders try to blow it but I can't let it happen, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's business ain't nobody's business
In other words, they don't know half of what I go through
To give, give you what you need
To be there, to be there for you and still do my thing
I'm talking 'bout music
'Cause it's what I gotta do to express how I really feel
See you write the songs, girl and I just do the singing
Without you I can't live
So heart to heart

[Chorus]
Baby, heart to heart
Baby, you're, you're the biggest part of my needs, girl
They can tell their stories
What you do for me, it gets too deep, girl
What I'd do for you, you'll never know
What they say to you, girl, let him go
You don't need him, you don't need him
You'd be better off hanging out with me
They try to break us up
They don't understand our love 'cause it gets to deep, girl

[Bridge]
Check me, my love, my love, my love
What would I do, what would I do without my love?
Without your loving in my life? I don't know
My love, my love, my love
Without you I can't live, it ain't no way
My love, my love, my love
You're the only one I need in order to be happy
What would I do without my love, don't you ever leave me
My love, my love, my love
Without you I can't live
So heart to heart

[Chorus]
Baby, heart to heart
Baby, you're, you're the biggest part of my needs, girl
They can tell their stories
What you do for me, it gets too deep, girl
What I'd do for you, you'll never know
What they say to you, girl, let him go
You don't need him, you don't need him
You'd be better off hanging out with me
They try to break us up
They don't understand our love 'cause it gets to deep, girl
