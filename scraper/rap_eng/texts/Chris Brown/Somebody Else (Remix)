[Intro]
You left me for somebody else now
You left me for somebody else now
You left me for somebody else now
You left me for somebody else now

[Verse 1]
I never saw this day coming
That you would ever wanna leave me
Baby, you told me no matter what
Your heart would always beat for me, always beat for me, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm alone, since she wanna be ghost, yeah
I don’t really like it, but I gotta take it damn, damn, damn, girl
When you coming back? So you never coming back? Yeah
I, I don’t believe that, but right now I gotta accept the fact

[Chorus]
You left me for somebody else now, I wish I never loved you
You left me, baby, you left me, girl, I can’t stop thinking 'bout you, yeah
You left me for somebody else now, girl, I wish I never loved you
You left me, baby, you left me because I wouldn't be your body

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you treat me bad, made me feel like you was my everything
You made me feel you was worth something, yeah
You had me feeling like you really cared
Told me you would always be there, but you're not here and that's not fair

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm alone, since she wanna be ghost, yeah
I don’t really like it, but I gotta take it damn, damn, damn, girl
When you coming back? So you never coming back? Yeah
I, I don’t believe that, but right now I gotta accept the fact

[Chorus]
You left me for somebody else now, I wish I never loved you
You left me, baby, you left me, girl, I can’t stop thinking 'bout you, yeah
You left me for somebody else now, girl, I wish I never loved you
You left me, baby, you left me because I wouldn't be your body

[Bridge]
You left me for somebody else, you left me, baby, you left me
You left me, oh yeah, you left me, baby, you left me, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
And now I'm all alone
No passion relaxin', they attract to my cologne
Cars, cash and fashion, look at it, I put you on
Money greedy for the cheese, add the provolone
You let him fuck, I don't buy that
'Cause Tommy by my gut, make 'em to fuck and turn this shit to Iraq
My shit blazin', tell me where you hot at?
She can't save you, I know where you hide at
She left me, but I seen it comin', ESP
Hit me below the belt, right under my testes
Got a nigga goin' crazy, missin' wet sheets
I should'a knew she want a waiter, check please
Audimars on the wrist
Supposed to be spendin' it on my bitch
Always claimin' I'm a fuck nigga
But it's funny how you trust niggas
