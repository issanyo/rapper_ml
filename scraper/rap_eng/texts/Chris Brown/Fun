[Intro: Pitbull]
Chris Brown, set it off (woo!)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Oh, feeling crazy
The moon is up, the night is hazy
Let's get lost in the shadows
Somewhere we can go where no one else can find

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull & Chris Brown]
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
Oh my my, looking like good-good time
Don't disguise, the way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight, have a little F.U.N, fun (woo!)

[Verse 2: Pitbull & Chris Brown]
Fresh from Monaco, performin' for Microsoft
Miami to L.A., G4, we takin' off (woo)
I'm a hard worker, I'm far from the boss
But when it's said and done, I'm ownin' it all (oh)
I know you think it’s just rap (huh, huh)
Just this, just that, haha, right (huh)
Nah, baby, this my life
Wanna have fun for a night? Then just (woo!)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
Oh my my, looking like good-good time
Don't disguise, the way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight, have a little F.U.N, fun (woo!)

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Go headlinin' on tour with Enrique
Often Casa Campo, who would've thought de que
Down in Key Largo, you know I'm on that sticky
Icky, icky, icky, icky
Don't do it much, but when I do, I'm gone
Don't take it all off, keep your heels and thong (yeah)
Ah Mamì, that turns me on
Now just listen to the song, and (woo!)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh my my, looking like good-good time
Don't disguise, the way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight, have a little F.U.N, fun

[Bridge: Pitbull]
Come on, Mamì, you know what it is
Come on, baby, you know what it is
I wanna, uh, let's go to the crib
And if you want, you can bring your friends
Come on, Mamì, you know what it is
Come on, baby, you know what it is
I wanna, uh, let's go to the crib
And if you want, you can bring your friends
And we can F.U.N., fun
Let's go, let's ride, let's show 'em how we do it in the 305

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Pitbull)]
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone (now remember, baby what happens in Miami never happens)
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone (F.U.N., fun, haha)
