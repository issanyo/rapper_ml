[Intro]
Oh no

[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, talking reckless all night
You gotta make that happen, baby, you got me excited, baby
Oh, oh, how come the one you got ain't never the one you need?
Listen to me
You say you, you talking 'bout you gon' walk out on this crazy dude
But I don't believe you
I don't really care about all that
So I keep coming back, I can't help myself

[Chorus]
You make it harder for me to wanna get up and leave
When you done put that thing on me, girl, you know just what I need
And I know that I should leave her alone
I'm in a fatal attraction, fatal attraction
If it was all up to me, we do it over and over, over again
But girl, what about your man?
I know that I should leave her alone
I'm in a fatal attraction, fatal attraction

[Verse 2]
Ooh baby, I swear, I want you to myself
Just how we got here
It's gon' take everything for me to leave you alone
'Cause the vision that I get, when I make your body be calling me
Baby, you know you like to give it to me, girl
You know how we do, I used to try and act
Like I ain't need you before but that was before
You make me want you more, girl, if he only knew that

[Chorus]
You make it harder for me to wanna get up and leave
When you done put that thing on me, girl, you know just what I need
And I know that I should leave her alone
I'm in a fatal attraction, fatal attraction
If it was all up to me, we do it over and over, over again
But girl, what about your man?
I know that I should leave her alone
I'm in a fatal attraction, fatal attraction
Girl, you make it harder for me to wanna get up and leave
When you done put that thing on me, girl, you know just what I need
And I know that I should leave her alone
I'm in a fatal attraction, fatal attraction
If it was all up to me, we do it over and over, over again
But girl, what about your man?
I know that I should leave her alone
I'm in a fatal attraction, fatal attraction
