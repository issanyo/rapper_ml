[Pre-Chorus]
Make it disappear like it's magic, magic
Bend it over, stretch it out, elastic, 'lastic
What if I said that you the one? Bring your friend, make it two for one
This the kinda shit, I do for fun, do for fun

[Chorus]
I'm with Mary and Molly (2 hoes, on one fuckin' pole)
Everyday this how we do it (2 hoes, on my fuckin' pole)
Take off your clothes (2 hoes, on one fuckin' pole)

When I pop them bands, wanna make you dance, yeah, yeah
And all the girls they be screaming out, "He the man", yeah, yeah
You got all my love, you know that I'm tippin' but I don't wanna trick it out
When you throw that ass around, I sit down, you givin' me that stripper love
You about to get all that, table dance on me

Okay, a ten-hut, I'm at attention
Bitch, stand up, I'm payin' pensions
I throw a hunnid racks, on these bad bitches
And a hunnid more for my niggas who sayin' quittin'
Oh no, I took away the top, I'm in a four door
Your bitch givin' me top, all in her photos
And all the niggas see
Is them limo tints and them low pros
You really wanna do it like me, that's a no go
Got a bad bitch bouncin' on my pogo
Up and down, up and down
She put that booty on the 'gram, now she got me spendin' more, more
Feelin' that dick
Growlin' like a dog, when I'm in that bitch
One night with me, baby and now you rich
Give a dog a bone, no kids shit 'cause I'm grown

[Pre-Chorus]
Make it disappear like it's magic, magic
Bend it over, stretch it out, elastic, 'lastic
