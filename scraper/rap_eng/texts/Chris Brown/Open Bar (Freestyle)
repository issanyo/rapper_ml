[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
In the club, no flexin'
Gettin' drunk off the liquor, start to drunk textin'
Tryna really test me
I don't care, on the forehead be my testes

[Interlude: J Cruz & Chris Brown]
He's got it, he's got it
Open bar, four topics, four bars

Girls who look through your phone
It happens to all of us, it happens to all of us
Alright, cool
So I have to say that to make it rhyme, right?
Yeah
Girls who look through your phone
C Breezy, Liftoff
Four bars, four topics
Alright, cool, aw damn
You got it, you got it

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Fresh up out the club, pull off the curb
Tryna get my phone, you won't get the password
One time, let's do it, can't do it alone
'Cause I'm doin' this shit,  you're scrollin' through my phone
And I say it, f it, f it, f it

[Interlude: J Cruz & Chris Brown]
Can't cuss though
I'ma have to, I'ma have it pay
I'll pay the fine, don't worry 'bout it
One more, one more topic, hey listen
Open bar, four bars, four topics, you ready?
Alright, what we got next?
LA girls, Chris Brown
LA girls, alright, alright
Let's do it, Chris
I'm tryna think, I'm tryna think
C Breezy, open bar, four bars, four topics
Liftoff, Power 106

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
Catch a fade but I usually have a curve
In the party with all the LA girls
Tryna see if they gon' twerk somethin' real for me
'Cause I don't care, really tryna feel on it
If you tryna give it to me, let me pop off
Give it once, I'll knock your block off

[Outro: J Cruz & Chris Brown]
Open bar, open bar on the Liftoff with Chris Brown
