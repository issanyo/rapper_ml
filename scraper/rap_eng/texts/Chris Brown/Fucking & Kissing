[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Would I be trippin'
If I tell you I'm different 'cause everyone's different?
But look, I'm somethin' different
Melody gifted, you are my witness
Louboutin Christians, givin' me blisters
I'm sinnin', but I miss you, and girl, do you miss me?
What's the difference between fuckin' and kissin'?
If you ain't with it, then we can just kick it
Fuck all the kissin'
We should just get into switchin' positions
Fuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin'
Girl, do you miss me? You trippin', 'cause I miss you

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Fuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin'
Fuck me and kiss me, like you miss me, I know you miss it
Fuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin'
Fuck me and kiss me, like you miss me 'cause I know you miss it

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Next time I fuck you, I don't want you to say, "I love you"
And next time you suck it, don't touch it
Do somethin' that's gon' make me cum quick
I wanna see how you bust it
But if you start buggin'
I'ma fall back and start actin' like I never met you
My money bigger, if I take your bitch
Man, I don't mean to be disrespectful, I'm just that nigga

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Would I be trippin'
If I DM your friends and fuck all your bitches?
Would it be ignant?
You say I'm trippin' but they the ones with it
I thought it was love
'Til you went out tellin' our business
Lyin' when you know you did it
Cryin' but don't see no tears
I guess we really all guilty
Fake friends all circle 'round me
You wanna show everybody 'round me how I'm bleeding
Plead, the truth, will set you free

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Fuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin'
Fuck me and kiss me, like you miss me, I know you miss it
Fuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin'
Fuck me and kiss me, like you miss me 'cause I know you miss it
