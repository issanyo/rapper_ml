[Intro]
Girl you ain't acting right but you're coming home tonight
Stop, baby don't tell me no, you're coming home tonight

[Verse 1]
Stop, I didn't want you to go
But I've been sleeping alone tonight, oh yeah
I-I-I, I can't stop thinking about you baby, cause you know I love you, girl
I'm high, jump in my car cause you're driving me crazy

[Chorus]
Baby just come back home, I've been sleeping alone tonight
I've been sipping a lot tonight, yeah
I need you in my arms, for the rest of my life
So come home tonight, yeah
Come home, come home, oh girl come over, oh baby tonight
Come home, oh girl come home
I've been sleeping alone tonight
So come home tonight

[Verse 2]
Funny that you miss my call, that ass still coming home tonight, yeah
Your friends probably think I'm a little off, it's cause you do me right
I-I-I, won't stop 'til I find you baby, no girl
I might die-ie-ie cause your love just drives me crazy girl

[Chorus]
Baby just come back home, I've been sleeping alone tonight
I've been sipping a lot tonight, yeah
I need you in my arms, for the rest of my life
So come home tonight, yeah
Come home, come home, oh girl come over, oh baby tonight
Come home, oh girl come home
