[Intro: Chris Brown]
Right now you warned, OHB, yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Let's talk about something, girl I need your acceptance
You're making assumptions, but you know it's nothing
The liquor keep calling, you know I need more
It's 99 problems, can't take anymore, I'm 'bout to mix up this Sprite with the 4
Oh, OHB 'bout to walk through
Only hot bitches in the bedroom
Pop a Xan, watch me get loose
Throwing all of these bands for you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Substance, substance, substance, substance
All this substance abuse, I need substance from you
Substance, substance, substance, substance
All this substance abuse, I need substance from you

[Verse 2: HoodyBaby]
Girl who do you fuck when I ain't in the city?
Driving me crazy, way over the limit
My homies, they say that I'm tripping
Fuck it I'm tripping, I'm crazy, I'm whipping
My heart is racing, this shit is amazing
This neck just the bandages
How did our love end up like the Kennedy's?
Mixing up drugs, yeah I got the remedy
Damn, you fucking the enemy
I gave you the best of me
Showed her how to trap out the bando
And left her the recipe, damn

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Substance, substance, substance, substance
All this substance abuse, I need substance from you
Substance, substance, substance, substance
All this substance abuse, I need substance from you

[Verse 3: Tracy T]
Substance abuse, substance from you
Thousand dollar tab, baby this I bought food
This a 2 seater baby, you can't car pool
Got the old school move, like the car new
Bands low, never make a girl spend it with me
When she gone, I get it back, make her spend another 60
Still cold hearted, say it's cold hearted
She shotgun, I drop the top lid and her hair blow
Them heels got you walking like you on the runway
No paper, we got the game like the arcade
Wonder which, I know you're gonna make it right for me
Put the pussy on the flight, make it tonight for me
And baby, I jump in that foreign
She hop in that passenger
She gon' work, she lowkey in the Acura
Bitch ain't cuffing, your boy still a bachelor

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Substance, substance, substance, substance
All this substance abuse, I need substance from you
Substance, substance, substance, substance
All this substance abuse, I need substance from you

[Verse 4: Young Lo]
4 in the morning, I'm thinking of you
Just got the ceiling, I'm pouring it through
How can I deal with this substance abuse?
I'm only asking this all cause of you
These Xannies got me tripping right now
Girl your love is like a Perc, my heart itching right now
See them flashes of your face, I wanna kiss you right now
But I know it's just the drugs that got me tripping right now
Tried to offer you my heart, you used it like the playground
Favorite groupies, jealously, I thought you would stay where I am
Guess it's back to prescriptions to deal with the symptoms
I can't feel my face and I'm losing my vision

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Substance, substance, substance, substance
All this substance abuse, I need substance from you

[Verse 5: Chris Brown]
In recovery, rehabilitating from you
Teach me a lesson, I'm drug testing, making all them moves
We both getting fucked up, what's your excuse?
A new slave with a new fade, my chain a noose
Bitch I'm sipping, you steady tripping and politicking
Taking vacations with your bitch, why she ain't posting pictures
I can lead her to that water if she wanna listen
If she don't drink, she gon' drink, I'm still gon' fuck some bitches
You know that pussy my addiction
She driving my stick, tryna fuck up my transmission
I'm pissed off, withdrawals just fucking up my pimping
Take a picture nigga, see how I'm living
Ain't going back to prison, I got too felonies, dismissing the case
A couple million, got a .45 locked in the safe
Hella bitches, hella bitches pile up in the Wraith
Hollywood with the cameras all up in your face
