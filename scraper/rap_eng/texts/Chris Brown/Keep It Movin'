[Verse 1]
She looked up from the book she was reading
With the prettiest smile that I ever saw
Curly hair down her back
And her skin like cinnamon brown without a flaw
And man, those eyes
Made my heart stop in my chest
Then she said, "Hi"
And it was hard to catch my breath
I said, "Hey lil mama
I don't mean to bother at all, my name is Chris" (hello, hello)
And before she could answer
I said, "Listen to this: I think you're fine"
And she cracked that smile again
Let's say goodbye to my homies and your friends

[Chorus]
We can dip out alone, keep it moving
Do something fun, and keep it moving
Talk about life, about love
That's what's up
Keep it moving, oh
Don't matter at all
Wherever we go, oh
Girl, just come on, let's keep it moving

[Verse 2]
So we exchange numbers
I told her I'll be at her crib by a quarter to six
We can go get a bite, little lady
Or chill at the mall and catch a flick
If that's alright
She said, "As long I'm home by nine
Whatever we do is fine"
I can't believe, I can't believe that she's here with me, no
And God, oh no, God oh me knows, how far we can go
I hope this night will go my way and we can do this everyday
And if I'm cool and take my time, then I might just get a kiss goodnight, oh yeah

[Chorus]
We can dip out alone, keep it moving
Do something fun, and keep it moving
Talk about life, about love
That's what's up
Keep it moving, oh
Don't matter at all
Wherever we go, oh
Girl, just come on, let's keep it moving
