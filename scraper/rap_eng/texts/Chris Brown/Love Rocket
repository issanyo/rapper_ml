[Verse 1]
I'm fly in the sky
Outer-space, a satellite
I wanna take a, a little ride
On your rocket, yeah yeah, your rocket
Headed for the milky way, a big surprise
Looking for the sugar rush, are, are you the guy
I'd be delighted if I was invited
So tell me how 'bout it, yeah
Definition of a freak, yeah
Let's do something crazy, yeah
I want you and you want me
And I don't need

[Chorus]
Your chain, your bling
It don't mean shit to me
Just keep your money in your pocket
Everything up in here, I own it
No fake I.D
Just keep it real with me
You know you want me
Boy, just stop it
Let me hop on your love rocket now
Let me hop on your love rocket now
Let me hop on your love rocket

[Verse 2]
How do I say to you
That you are my one and only?
Never leave me lonely, put your body on me
And hold me close, yeah
Let's take off to a place we never been
And make love all night 'til the morning
Mi girls tell me get him now, mi have to catch him now
Mi say me want to see you comfortable, anything to make you smile
To make you smile, to make you smile
I said me want to see you comfortable and make you smile
And make you smile and make you smile
But I don't need too much

[Chorus]
Your chain, your bling
It don't mean shit to me
Just keep your money in your pocket
Everything up in here, I own it
No fake I.D
Just keep it real with me
You know you want me
Boy, just stop it
Let me hop on your love rocket now
Let me hop on your love rocket now
Let me hop on your love rocket

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Wa da da ding, wa da da da ding

A rocketship go up, a rocketship go up
A rocketship go up, yeah
Love love rocket, love love love rocket
Love love rocket, love love love rocket
Love love rocket, love love love rocket
Love love, love love

[Chorus]
Your chain, your bling
It don't mean shit to me
Just keep your money in your pocket
Everything up in here, I own it
