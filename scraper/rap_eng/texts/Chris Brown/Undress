[Intro]
I'll show you mine if you show me yours

[Chorus]
Undress, we don't need no clothes for this shit
Undress, you don't need no clothes for this shit, yeah
Undress, we don't need no clothes for this shit, yeah
Undress, you don't need no clothes for this shit
You don't need no clothes for this shit

[Verse 1]
Baby girl, you fine like wine, take your time
I just wanna be that mirror, oh my
Tell them all, ain't no next 'cause you mine
Girl, you know ain't shit change, but the line, yeah
Still the same nigga, 4 4 came with me
I be grain gripping, 44's lane switching
When I get home, when I get home
As soon as I walk in the door, as soon as I walk in the

[Chorus]
Undress, we don't need no clothes for this shit
Undress, you don't need no clothes for this shit, yeah
Undress, we don't need no clothes for this shit, yeah
Undress, you don't need no clothes for this shit
You don't need no clothes for this shit

[Verse 2]
Wanna know my perspective, think your body's been neglected
I can eat it, lunch and dinner, ain't no skipping breakfast
I don't wanna pass you up
I don't wanna take a chance
To let a nigga scoop you up, they let you know in advance
24's on the Jeep, do it all just to stunt
Young nigga acting crazy, 20 bottles on the way
I don't see no competition, know these niggas out there wishing
Tell them put it on they wishlist 'cause as soon as we get to the crib

[Chorus]
Undress, we don't need no clothes for this shit
Undress, you don't need no clothes for this shit, yeah
Undress, we don't need no clothes for this shit, yeah
Undress, you don't need no clothes for this shit
You don't need no clothes for this shit
