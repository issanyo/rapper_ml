[Intro: Chris Brown]
Only this once you know you owe me
I said this shit ain't free
Only this once you know you owe me
I said this shit ain't free

[Verse 1: Kristii]
I'm lightning in a bottle
Once you let me out we're gonna have a problem
Baby tell me do you think that you can handle
Everything i got boy tell me that you're ready
Hope you're ready gonna get you into trouble
Everything you think you know is gonna crumble
Got your vision zoomin' in just like a tunnel
Oh baby don't be scared you won't regret it
Let me out and come and let me out

[Chorus: Kristii & Chris Brown]
Every time you hear the thunder
And you know I'm on my way
Can't contain it any longer
I'm lightning in a bottle
Only this once you know you owe me
I said this shit ain't free (Lightning in a bottle)
Only this once you know you owe me
I said this shit ain't free (I'm lightning in a bottle)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I just wanna buy bottles
A 100 bottles in the club that's me nigga
I've been around the world, with every girl on the street
Your bitch looking at me nigga, I'm bout to leave with her
I just wanna buy bottles and you came here to light up
That will never work cause all she wants is
All she wanna do is give her good
Soon as i licked the blunt she said

[Chorus: Kristii & Chris Brown]
Everytime you hear the thunder
And you know I'm on my way
Can't contain it any longer
I'm lightning in a bottle
Only this once you know you owe me
I said this shit ain't free (lightning in a bottle)
Only this once you know you owe me
I said this shit ain't free (lightning in a bottle)

[Verse 3: O.T. Genasis]
Yeah, ever tripped over some pussy then you fell in love
She got that type that made me feel like i was in a tub
And all that liquor had me lit like i was in a bulb
I'll be there like a judge, yuh, run it up
Yeah, its lightning when we touch
I guess just I'm the plug
You got me hooked and now i get it cause she's like a drug
I'm talking bottle after bottle when we're in the club
Got them racks up on my jeans I'm bout to run it up

[Outro: Kristii & Chris Brown]
Lightning in a bottle
Lightning in a bottle
Only this once you know you owe me
Only this once you know you owe me
Only this once you know you owe me
Only this once you know you owe me
