[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's a 360 turn, sitting where we begin
Beginning like here's the end, like kissing and missing class
But we needed to learn was different than just some math
It's the big picture, we missed it, the figures just didn't add up

[Pre-Chorus]
We said let's not leave on bad terms
In between them bad words, it could be love right? Uh, huh
But are we gon' leave when it's this good? Damn it just cause
Seems this loving's all for nothing, baby you know

[Chorus]
A heart ain't a brain
But I think that I still love you, still love you
A happy ending makes you cry
Cause it ends when you don't want to, don't want to
And it makes perfect sense to end it like the start
How do I explain this nonsense to my heart?
A heart ain't a brain but I'm thinking that
I still love you, still love you, still love you

[Verse 2]
It's a fly twist, just when you said I got this
Right when the fight has stopped it seem my body felt wrong
Held on, all them nights we held on, we can't let it go
But if we don't then we will never know

[Pre-Chorus]
We said let's not leave on bad terms
In between them bad words, it could be love right? Uh, huh
But are we gon' leave when it's this good? Damn it just cause
Seems this loving's all for nothing, baby you know

[Chorus]
A heart ain't a brain
But I think that I still love you, still love you
A happy ending makes you cry
Cause it ends when you don't want to, don't want to
And it makes perfect sense to end it like the start
How do I explain this nonsense to my heart?
A heart ain't a brain but I'm thinking that
I still love you, still love you, still love you

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
My heart is aching thinking 'bout all the love we wasted
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
My heart's impatient, can't understand the time we're taking
My heart can't have, my heart can't decide but it's telling me it's right
And I know that we should just call it quits
But I'm thinking that all of this gotta change
Cause my heart's going insane

[Chorus]
A heart ain't a brain
But I think that I still love you, still love you
A happy ending makes you cry
Cause it ends when you don't want to, don't want to
And it makes perfect sense to end it like the start
And how do I explain this nonsense to my heart?
A heart ain't a brain but I'm thinking that
I still love you, still love you, still love you

[Outro]
A heart ain't a brain but I think I love you
A heart ain't a brain but I think I love you
A heart ain't a brain but I think I love you
A heart ain't a brain but I think I love you
