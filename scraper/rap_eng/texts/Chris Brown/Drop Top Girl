[Intro: Tyga]
Haha, my lil drop top girl

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Sweet lil something, turbo button
Four fifty eight, engine running
LA so sunny, I'm so Young Money
And that base in the trunk got that bitch bumping, that's my shit
Don't skip nothing, play it loud
'Til the top of the world for me
I fear nothing, ride 'til the cops coming
Colour Coupe seats honey, I went from
Rags to the wrist glitter, Car 6, Rooms
In the crib, arcade I did
Walk your ass right in girl, leave in a minute
Ever had sex on the sand?
I guarantee this will be the ride of your life
Round the world, do it all in one night
Most them girls, I play 'em and never wife
But it's something about you that I like

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl I really love the way you look at me
Ain't no other feeling that can drive me crazy
Tonight girl tonight
It's gon' be the night to take you down

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, tell me what you doing tonight
You can be my drop top girl, take it all off tonight
Shawty, don't stop now, tell me what we're doing tonight
We can be in my drop top girl, its only me and you tonight, take it off

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
She know she love it, no sheets, no covers
Give it to her all night, all night loving
Gold rubbers, uh uh, let me touch it
Ain't a new thing to me, uh it's nothing
Girl, just say something baby
Drop top girls, drive me crazy
Shawty know that I got what she need though
That's why she all on me for, ha

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl I really love the way you look at me
Ain't no other feeling that can drive me crazy
Tonight girl tonight
It's gon' be the night to take you down

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, tell me what you doing tonight
You can be my drop top girl, take it all off tonight
Shawty, don't stop now, tell me what we're doing tonight
We can be in my drop top girl, its only me and you tonight, take it off
