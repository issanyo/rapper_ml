[Intro: Ace Hood & Chris Brown]
Yeah
If I call my baby
Ace Hood
She pick up the phone every time
That's right
At the the drop of a dime, yeah
That rider
Girl

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Your girl don't need any kind of lover, be the right kind of lover
Be the kind of girl make me want to turn you to a mother
And I promise, promise, baby, there'll be always and forever
Yeah, we'll always be together
If you show me your ambitions of a rider
Your ambitions of a rider
If you show me your ambitions of a rider
Your ambitions of a rider
If you show me your ambitions of a rider

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Uh, would you ride for me? Would you die for me?
Had no money, would you still love me?
If I got jammed up and did a little time
Would you still be the woman who gon' hold it down?
Through the hard times and them cloudy days
Would you stand strong? Would you run away?
All the bullshit and all the heartache
She still ridin' with a nigga since the first day
Her ambitions of a rider
She would be around if I never had a dollar
She would be my nurse if I ever need a doctor
Bonnie and Clyde, she never side with the coppers
Never break code, forever be loyal
Never break ties 'til we buried in the soil
If it ever go down, she tryna go too
Down for whatever bullshit I'm goin' through
And I gotta hold on, know that she my backbone
Nothin' like that feelin' when I'm in her so long
Passion and that lovin' that between us so strong
Grippin' on that ass, she just tell me, "Hold on"
And she can be the wife, maybe one day
Have a few kids, go and travel out the state
She gon' ride or die for a nigga 'til the grave
And I hope it never change

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Your girl don't need any kind of lover, be the right kind of lover
Be the kind of girl make me want to turn you to a mother
And I promise, promise, baby, there'll be always and forever
Yeah, we'll always be together
If you show me your ambitions of a rider
Your ambitions of a rider
If you show me your ambitions of a rider
Your ambitions of a rider
If you show me your ambitions of a rider

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Uh, need a down bitch for a real nigga
Never lied to her, keep it real with her
Got her own money 'cause she a go getter
And she allergic to them broke and them hoe niggas
Rule number one is that it ain't none
Probably make shawty my wife when the day come
Nothin' like a pretty lady who can roll up
Them other hoes, yeah, they mad, so what?
Me and you for life, team us
Big face Rollies, you can get the same one
I'm in that Mulsanne, you in that coupe, what?
Ain't that many people 'round that I do trust
You the last of a dyin' breed
Ride for me, baby, everythin' is guaranteed
Anythin' you ever wanted, or ever need
Turn life out of any dream
I mean that, keep it 100, when I need that, she gon' come runnin'
When I fiend for it, give that ass to me
Never tell her no, she get the last from me
If I get jail, gotta go to court, she be right there, need I say more? Love

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Your girl don't need any kind of lover, be the right kind of lover
Be the kind of girl make me want to turn you to a mother
And I promise, promise, baby, there'll be always and forever
Yeah, we'll always be together
If you show me your ambitions of a rider
Your ambitions of a rider
If you show me your ambitions of a rider
Your ambitions of a rider
If you show me your ambitions of a rider

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Show me, show me
Baby, show me your ambitions of a rider
Oh, yeah, please show me
If you show me your ambitions of a rider
Your ambitions of a rider
If you show me your ambitions of a rider
Your ambitions of a rider
If you show me your ambitions of a rider
