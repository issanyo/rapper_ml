[Verse 1]
How'd did you get so young, I heard that you were born today
Heard that you came from the sky and I just wanna say
Welcome, the world is glad you're here to stay
Have fun, it's time to give another day

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes a fire can get in your way
But that ain't nothing, you can't blow away

[Chorus]
So make a wish, I have one too
I wish that I could stay with you
Wish you knew how much I want all your wishes to come true
It's all about you, it's all about you today, today
It's all about you
It's all about you, today, today

[Verse 2]
Girl what do you want? I swear I'll give you everything
New car parked out front, flowers, bags and wedding rings
Well done, the world is glad you're here to stay
Have fun, it's time to give another day

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes a fire can get in your way
But that ain't nothing, you can't blow away

[Chorus]
So make a wish, I have one too
I wish that I could stay with you
Wish you knew how much I want all your wishes to come true
It's all about you, it's all about you today, today
It's all about you
It's all about you, today, today
