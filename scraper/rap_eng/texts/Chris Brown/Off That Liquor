Girl, you talking out the side of your neck
And drinking a little too much
You talking crazy, it's all in your head
You’re tipsy and ready for loving
So you’re calling me over
To touching, kiss on your body, the middle of night
But it’s more to you than just that
Well I won’t complain if you throw it back, yeah

Come close 'cause your happiness is all that matters to me
Girl, I know and I'ma cherish what I have
