[Intro]
I swear I got no filter, no filter
I swear I got no filter, no filter

[Verse 1]
This juice got me loose, ain't no use in holding
Tell me something wrong?
Slurring words, it's got a mind of its own
When I'm on one, when I'm on one, I'm really on one, I'm really on one
I got a limo round my waist, put that milkshake in my face
Girl we fuck the night away
Lick your lips, girl that's my taste
When I'm on one, when I'm on one, I'm really on one, I'm really on one

[Chorus]
When I see that ooh I just might
Why is it so wrong if it feels right?
I swear I got no filter, no filter
I swear I got no filter, no filter
I'm out of fucks to give
I got no filter, no filter
I'm out of fucks to give
Put you on now with no filter

You know I don't give a fuck, ha

[Verse 2]
King bed in my room tell me cause it can improve
Let me get you slip and sliding
Skinny dipping, scuba wilding
When I'm on one, when I'm on one, I'm really on one, I'm really on one
I see that donk, tasty romp
And it make me wanna hump
All night, all night, I just gotta go all night
When I'm on one yeah, dripping on one, I'm really on one

[Chorus]
When I see that ooh I just might
Why is it so wrong if it feels right?
I swear I got no filter, no filter
I swear I got no filter, no filter
I'm out of fucks to give
I got no filter, no filter
I'm out of fucks to give
Put you on now with no filter

[Bridge]
Juice got me loose, ain't no use in holding
Juice got me loose, but I gotta go all night
When I'm on one, when I'm on one
When I'm on one, when I'm on one

[Chorus]
When I see that ooh I just might
Why is it so wrong if it feels right?
I swear I got no filter, I wanna eat that pussy, no filter
I swear I got no filter, no filter
I'm out of fucks to give
I got no filter, no filter
I'm out of fucks to give
Put you on now with no filter
I got no filter

[Outro]
Ooh I just might
Why is it so wrong if it feels right?
Lick your lips, girl that's my taste
When I'm on one
