[Intro: Chris Brown]
Die-ie-ie-ie-ie, woah
Would you miss me?

[Chorus:  Chris Brown]
If we die-ie-ie-ie-ie
All of my niggas they came with the choppers
Ride or die as a young nigga
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta
Ride or die as a young nigga, ayy
I'ma be a legend when I go
If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie
All of my niggas they came with the choppers
Ride or die as a young nigga
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta
Ride or die as a young nigga
I’m probably dead (buck, buck, buck)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Hear the gun shots sound, another black man down
'Nother innocent killed by the police, which side are you on?
All the violence is red and blue, oh
And the sons of a mother who never had a father
Tryna change a boy to a man
Got love for you, mama don't cry, we gon' be alright
'Cause one man shouldn't hate on another man
Judge no one 'cause of the color skin, oh
Let's stop killing each other, it's genocide
And if I die before I wake
I just pray to God my soul to take, oh yeah
If my brother is ridin', then we ridin', livin' like a young nigga

[Chorus:  Chris Brown]
If we die-ie-ie-ie-ie
All of my niggas they came with the choppers
Ride or die as a young nigga
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta
Ride or die as a young nigga, ayy
I'ma be a legend when I go
If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie
All of my niggas they came with the choppers
Ride or die as a young nigga
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta
Ride or die as a young nigga
I’m probably dead (buck, buck, buck)

[Verse 2: Nas]
In the projects it's made, so we don't progress
Experimental test, watch us kill each other
Film another homicide, they tape it, nobody make it
See, he goin' to kill the same lab rat he was raised with
Such and such, so and so, brother
They got right on top of each other
Too close, he got a new toast to shoot close
Gun go bang, talk your slang
Basics, soon the whole hood gon' have cases
See my neighbours, see my haters, see federal agents
Pharmacies ain't givin' out no medical favors
But we got scripts to codeine and oxycontin
Gettin' rich off that like ain't no other options
Autopsy, dissect 'em, they open him up
All they wanna see is if he had coke in his blood
'Cause the cops shot him, just 'cause he came from the rock bottom
Now you see his name in the body column, they bodied him, uh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If we die-ie-ie-ie-ie (oh, probably die)
All of my niggas they came with the choppers
Ride or die as a young nigga
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta (probably die)
Ride or die as a young nigga (ayy)
I'ma be a legend when I go
If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie (hey)
‘Cause all of my niggas they came with the choppers
Ride or die as a young nigga (we sippin' codeine)
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta
Ride or die as a young nigga (hey)
I’m probably dead (buck, buck, buck)

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I’m living for my daughter
Ooh, ooh
‘Cause my baby need a father
Ooh, ooh
Don’t wanna die young, young nigga, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You got my back, I’m rollin’ with you
Ooh, ooh
Holding me down 'cause it's what we do, do, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If we die-ie-ie-ie-ie (die-ie-ie-ie-ie)
All of my niggas they came with the choppers
Ride or die as a young nigga (ride or die as a young nigga)
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta (ayy)
Ride or die as a young nigga
I'ma be a legend when I go
If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie (die-ie-ie-ie-ie)
All of my niggas they came with the choppers
Ride or die as a young nigga
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta (ooh)
Ride or die as a young nigga (ooh)
I’m probably dead (buck, buck, buck)

[Outro]
If I die, just look into the sky
I ain’t even gon’ lie, tell my niggas don’t cry ‘bout nothin'
If there’s somethin' on my mind, I was busy tryna find
I was drunk gettin' high
