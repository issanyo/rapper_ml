[Intro: Chris Brown]
Ha, niggas sayin' it's easy tryna be me (oh yeah, right now)
Shit, haha, let them try (Hitmaka, ow)
I'll show 'em my moves

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I been patient for some time, yeah
When I wife a bitch, I'm keepin' all my side hoes
Yeah, nigga tellin' me I changed up
In the foreign whip, I'm whippin' like Django
Yeah, I might give a bitch a makeover
Mix Patron and Hennessy without a hangover
Yeah, if I fuck you in that Range Rover
I get that pussy 'fore you came over, surprise you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh, she lovin', she lovin' the life
Ooh, she lovin', she lovin' the life
I wanna run up a check on you, girl
Finesse the plug tonight
Ooh, she lovin', she lovin' the life

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
(Oh nah)
She say, "Dolla you so brazy"
She say, "Dolla boy, why you so crazy?" (Yeah)
Got me out here looking crazy
"Dolla boy, you should give me some babies," yeah
Yeah, I like it, fly me out private (yeah)
You the boy, yeah, let me drive the Porsche, yeah
You my man, yeah, I'm your biggest fan, yeah
Put me down, let me meet Chris Brown, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Ty Dolla $ign)]
Ooh, she lovin', she lovin, she lovin' the life (she lovin')
Ooh, she lovin', she lovin' the life (oh yeah, ooh, ooh, yeah)
I wanna run up a check on you, girl (I wanna run up a check on you, girl)
Finesse the plug tonight (finesse the plug tonight)
Ooh, she lovin', she lovin' the life

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Everyday, we could run the playback
MVP, she wouldn't trade that life
Blue Gin for breakfast
She get that French toast with the extras
Hit the mall 'fore they open the restaurants
Sippin' on champagne in the shoe section
Insecure, she just lookin' for acceptance
And you know that, all my cards get accepted
I told her 'bout the colors on the bottoms
At first she didn't understand the designer, get it
Now you speak the language, baby, she comin'
Hit the door to the dressin' room and give me head

[Bridge: Chris Brown ]
I might give a bitch a makeover
Mix Patron and Hennessy without a hangover
Yeah, if I fuck you in that Range Rover
I get that pussy 'fore you came over, surprise you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh, she lovin', she lovin' the life (she love it, ooh, baby)
Ooh, she lovin', she lovin' the life (life)
I wanna run up a check on you, girl
Finesse the plug tonight (yeah)
Ooh, she lovin', she lovin' the life (oh, she lovin')

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
Haha, she lovin' the life, she lovin' the lights
She fuckin' with a thug, them other niggas treat her right
Before I could read or write, I was thinkin' pussy
The police readin' my rights, give a fuck if they bookin'
Bitch, I'm a money machine, we poppin' bottles tonight
I'm payin' bitches to leave, I pay my niggas to fight
I'm 'bout that cash flow, tell me wassup with that ass though
You know where they trickin', if you gotta spend a bag on 'em
Only fuck with bad hoes, nigga, check the tag on 'em
I'ma get a girl a chain, but usually I would swerve on 'em
Fuck it, about to spurge on 'em
You ain't gotta ask twice, baby, this your night
I'ma change your life, when you get this pipe

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh, she lovin, she lovin' the life (she lovin', baby)
Ooh, she lovin', she lovin' the life (the life)
I wanna run up a check on you, girl
Finessed the plug tonight (yeah, oh)
Ooh, she lovin', she lovin' the life (she lovin', she lovin')
