[Intro]
Remo the Hitmaker
Ugh

[Chorus: Chris Brown & French Montana]
You know I be riding round the town and down the block
(I be riding through the city, girl)
You know I be riding round the town and down the block
(I be riding through the city)
I'm in my hood all day (I'm in my hood)
It's the gangsta way
You know my way (You know my way)
Them boys don't play (Oh, my niggas don't play) (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
You know I be riding round the town and down the block
(Just rolling through my city, yeah)
You know I be riding round the town and down the block
(Just rolling through my city)
I'm in my hood all day (I'm in my hood)
It's the gangsta way (Oh yeah)
You know my way (You know my way)
Them boys don't play (Oh, my niggas don't play) (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Niggas said Hollywood, a nigga done made it
If I don't make it, I'ma call her on FaceTime, she gon' go crazy
I just want her ass up, face down, yelling out, "Baby"
Reppin' for my city, know they miss me, it's been a while, money ain't change me (haa)
Whip it then we flip it, head up North Street
Fuck what it cost, European whips, we be flossin' (skrrt)
Limp when I walk, you fuckin' with a boss (haa)
Oh I'm, you know

[Chorus: Chris Brown & French Montana]
You know I be riding round the town and down the block
(I be riding through the city, girl)
You know I be riding round the town and down the block
(I be riding through the city)
I'm in my hood all day (I'm in my hood)
It's the gangsta way
You know my way (You know my way)
Them boys don't play (Oh, my niggas don't play) (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
You know I be riding round the town and down the block
(Just rolling through my city, yeah)
You know I be riding round the town and down the block
(Just rolling through my city)
I'm in my hood all day (I'm in my hood)
It's the gangsta way (Oh yeah)
You know my way (You know my way)
Them boys don't play (Oh, my niggas don't play)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Girl, you know I'll never leave
You know my heart is in these streets
And that ghetto love ain't changing
I'ma put on for my city, that's that Virginia in me
It's a big world for a little country boy, yeah, yeah
Now everybody knows my name
Baby, I'm coming home
Country nigga ain't change

[Chorus: Chris Brown & French Montana]
You know I be riding round the town and down the block
(I be riding through the city, girl)
You know I be riding round the town and down the block
(I be riding through the city)
I'm in my hood all day (I'm in my hood)
It's the gangsta way
You know my way (You know my way)
Them boys don't play (Oh, my niggas don't play) (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Baby, you know I be riding round the town and down the block
(Just rolling through my city, yeah)
You know I be riding round the town and down the block
(Just rolling through my city)
I'm in my hood all day (I'm in my hood)
It's the gangsta way (Oh yeah)
You know my way (You know my way)
Them boys don't play (Oh, my niggas don't play)
