[Intro: Chris Brown]
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: Rita Ora]
Baby, let's cut down the lights
I just really wanna let this fire burn bright
I'm just telling you to have an open mind
Just imagine us (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
You're taking me there, you're taking me there
Our lips are barely touching
So do it again, so do it again
We could be on to something

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Heyo, heyo, if you want it, then you got it, hold me
No more, no more wasting time, we can, we can go all night
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Body on me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Put you up against the wall
And I'ma go to work 'til you get off
Baby, soon as you're done, we'll go some more, oh, oh
Girl, just imagine us

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & Chris Brown]
You're taking me there, you're taking me there
Our lips are barely touching
So do it again, so do it again
We could be on to something

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I just wanna feel your body on me
If you want it, then you got it, hold me
No more, no more wasting time, we can, we can go all night
