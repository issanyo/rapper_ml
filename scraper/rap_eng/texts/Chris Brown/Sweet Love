[Intro]
Freak me, baby
Yeah, you ready? I don't think so

[Chorus]
Oh baby, let's get naked, just so we can make sweet love
All these sensations got me going crazy for you
Inside on top of you, grinding inside and out of you
Baby I know what to do, baby I know what to do
So come on baby girl, let's just take our clothes off
Just so we can make sweet love

[Verse 1]
Girl, I want to know your body
Tonight is the night that I change your life, oh
Just let me control your body, girl, you shy you wanna slow it down?
And you start screaming when I go down town
Oh baby tell my why you're so excited
You know I love it when you take it off, so baby, go ahead and take it off tonight

[Chorus]
Oh baby, let's get naked, just so we can make sweet love
All these sensations got me going crazy for you
Inside on top of you, grinding inside and out of you
Baby I know what to do, baby I know what to do
So come on baby girl, let's just take our clothes off
Just so we can make sweet love

[Verse 2]
I'm making sweet love to you baby, go ahead and take it off, let's get naked
Cause you I know love to turn you on, girl, let's do it to your favourite song, yeah
With the candles lit and the lights low
Baby girl I want for you to roll, just roll your hips and just grind on me, grind on me, grind on me baby
And baby don't get it confused, I'll do everything you want me to
Just as long as you get crazy and just as soon as you get naked, making love

[Chorus]
Oh baby, let's get naked, just so we can make sweet love
All these sensations got me going crazy for you
Inside on top of you, grinding inside and out of you
Baby I know what to do, baby I know what to do
So come on baby girl, let's just take our clothes off
Just so we can make sweet love

[Outro]
Sweet love
