[Intro: Chris Brown]
Oh, do you want me girl?

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Baby love, how you been doing?
Have you been naughty or nice, baby? Tell me what are we doing?
It's snowing, all this beautiful music
And when I unwrap a present tonight, you gon' be the one, listen to me now, I want you to

[Pre-Chorus: Se7en & Chris Brown]
I want you you to, do you want me, boy? Take it off
Do you want me, boy?
Girl, Just kiss me, oh baby
Under the mistletoe

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And we can both say, Christmas came today
And we both say, Christmas came today

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Baby love, you know I'm hungry, yeah, your bra and panties fit right
But girl I just wanna taste your cookies, oh simply they won't hear a sound
I'm like oh no, she come back like a yo yo, girl I don't make it rain, I make you snow
Do you want me to start, then you tell me no, your love it so hard that the tree fell on the floor

[Pre-Chorus: Se7en & Chris Brown]
I want you you to, do you want me, boy? Take it off
Do you want me, boy?
Girl, Just kiss me, oh baby
Under the mistletoe

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And we can both say, Christmas came today
And we both say, Christmas came today

[Pre-Chorus: Se7en & Chris Brown]
I want you you to, do you want me, boy? Take it off
Do you want me, boy?
Girl, Just kiss me, oh baby
Under the mistletoe
