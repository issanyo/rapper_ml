[Verse 1: Konshens]
Konshens
Gyal!
Party soon done so you know where mi medz deh
5 am, a my hours dem deh
Bruk inna your house like a prisoner weh get 'way
Pull dem legs deh, me tougher than a Benbai
Cologne make you know say a me that
Don't turn 'round, don't look back
Run mi fingers dem slow pon your smooth back
God knows...me hard like a book back
But calm down a little, me no ready yet
Your shoulders a get the kiss dem weh delicate
I grab you in your neck, always make you wet
You're wet, but you tight like you're celibate
Slap up, slap up, rough you up a lil bit
Pull you by your hair and call you mi, "lil bitch"
Hey gyal, a who you a play with?
How much me tell you say you no fi sleep naked?
Adrenaline turning up high now
You a beg me fi full you up right now
Through the windows sun coming in light now
Watch how me ago make your fluffy pillow get white now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Just let me rock, sex you back to sleep girl
Don't say a word no, don't you talk
Just hold on tight to me girl
Sex you back to sleep girl, rock you back

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Now where you at? Just dropped my bags
I'm coming through to meet ya, oh yeah, to meet ya oh
I know you're almost half asleep but you know I might just need ya
Girl I need ya, oh
Gon' gimme that spare key, oh
But if you keep the door unlocked, be ready, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I know you got work pretty early, I'll be around by 3:30
Usually you're done one, so baby when I wake you up

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Just let me rock, sex you back to sleep girl
Don't say a word no, don't you talk
Baby just hold on tight to me girl
Sex you back to sleep girl, rock you

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Ain't sorry that I woke ya, I ain't sorry 'bout ya job
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love
I know you want me, how you feel me cause you never disagree
So when you wake from your sleep, girl

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Just let me rock, sex you back to sleep girl
Don't say a word no, girl don't you talk
Just hold on tight to me girl
Sex you back to sleep girl, and rock you back

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Ain't sorry that I woke ya, I ain't sorry 'bout ya job, fuck you back to sleep girl
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love
Ain't sorry that I woke ya, I ain't sorry 'bout ya job, fuck you back to sleep girl
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love
