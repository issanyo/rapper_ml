[Intro: Bryan-Michael Cox]
Yo, it is an honour to introduce the future of R&B
His name, is Chris Brown, and uh, you know what this is, another beat trax joint

[Verse 1]
Round one, I hear the ding
I walk up and shake your hand, girl I gotta know what's up
Baby what's your name? Can I get your number?
Cause I want to talk about some things, yeah
Round two, it ain't a thing, I was moving every way you move
Bobbing and weaving, like a young boy was supposed to do
It seemed like only yesterday that we did it
Now you on me like a fitted and I just gotta say, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby, you're a winner
Didn't even take ya twelve round to do it
You got the title now
I'mma tell the whole world to give it up for my girl
Baby, you're a winner
Didn't even take ya twelve round to do it
You got the title now
I'mma tell the whole world to give it up for my girl

[Verse 2]
Round three, I can see me and you walking down the aisle
And I know we're young so it'll be a while before we're doing that
But my momma got me in training
Getting ready for the day where I'mma make somebody happy
Said I was done with loving 'til I found someone like you
Oh somebody tell me what I was supposed to do
You put my back against the ropes, no choice but to unfold
I gotta give it to you baby

[Chorus]
Baby, you're a winner
Didn't even take ya twelve round to do it
You got the title now
I'mma tell the whole world to give it up for my girl
Baby, you're a winner
Didn't even take ya twelve round to do it
You got the title now
I'mma tell the whole world to give it up for my girl

[Bridge]
Girl, baby I just can't believe that every time you come around
I start losing my breath, I'm tripping over myself cause you hitting me, hitting me
Oh girl, baby it's so plain to see that you got the best of me, so I'm throwing in the towel, baby I bow out
Let it breathe, hah hah, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, you're a winner
Didn't even take ya twelve round to do it
You got the title now
I'mma tell the whole world to give it up for my girl
Baby, you're a winner
Didn't even take ya twelve round to do it
You got the title now
I'mma tell the whole world to give it up for my girl
Baby, you're a winner
Didn't even take ya twelve round to do it
You got the title now
I'mma tell the whole world to give it up for my girl
Baby, you're a winner
Didn't even take ya twelve round to do it
You got the title now
I'mma tell the whole world to give it up for my girl
