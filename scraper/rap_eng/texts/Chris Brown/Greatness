[Verse 1: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
You see what I'm sitting on, the strip we sitting on
These right in front of the club
Shawty, what you sipping on? You see me getting grown
So baby, just show me some love
Yeah, I want a girl like you
I can tell that you're looking for a dude like me
Can you smell what I'm cooking?
Let me know if you wanna ride
'Cause I ain't got nobody on my passenger side
Baby, I'm just hitting on ya, I wanna get to know ya
I don't wanna waste your time
And I'ma keep it real with ya
I wanna deal with ya, even if it's for one night
Baby, I want a girl like you
I can tell that you're looking for a dude like me
Can you smell what I'm cooking?
I came to have some fun
I'll be on the dance floor whenever you done
Shawty, you the one

[Chorus: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
I got to get ya, got to get with ya
I can do this, for a month or two, girl
I got the plan, the beach with the sand
And you got the man, right in front of you, girl
And you moving to the left, moving to the right
You make me say woah, woah, woah, woah
Now shake your body
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake ya body
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Stop, uh oh, keep going
Shake ya body
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it

[Verse 2: T-Pain & Chris Brown]
Shawty, what I'm sitting for
That we can hit the door right into the Masserati
I know you are super fine, you got them super thighs
I'ma need a SUV
Girl, I got my city on lock
If you're messing with me, you gon' end up at top
And it won't stop
Baby, tell me what you wanna see
'Cause you ain't never met a dude as freaky as me
Girl, I see they hating on ya
Just keep on skating on 'em, live aligaters on your feet
I got what you waiting for
Girl, I'ma take you home and let you go crazy on me
Girl, I got my city on lock
If you're messing with me, you gon' end up at top
I came to have some fun, shawty
I'll be outside in the car when you done
Shawty, you the one

[Chorus: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
I got to get ya, got to get with ya
I can do this, for a month or two, girl
I got the plan, the beach with the sand
And you got the man, right in front of you, girl
And you moving to the left, moving to the right
You make me say woah, woah, woah, woah
Now shake your body
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake ya body
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Stop, uh oh, keep going
Shake ya body
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
