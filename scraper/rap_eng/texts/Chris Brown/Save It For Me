She said only real niggas get to fuck with me
Save it for me, oh

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Passed my number to Angela, I thought I had her (I thought I had her)
Her nigga cuffed her, married, it made me madder
I respect it, I'm moving on, but the truth is I want her badder
Maybe me sayin' her name made him move faster (facts)
Maybe me bein' a G was kind of bad for her (G, bad)
But me bein' a G, I was glad for her (G, I was glad)
My baby mama was pissed, I ain't heard the last from her (pissed)
My side bitch with the shit, but I bought a bag for her

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I told her I'll be right back, oh (yeah)
I'll be comin' right back (okay, I'm comin' right back)
She gon', save it for me (yeah)
Now she gon' save it for me (yeah)
Don't give it up, please don't give it up
It's too good, they don't need to know
All you gotta do is save it for me, oh
She gon' save it for me

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Told you once, I get my money, I'm comin' back for you (I am)
You from the hood, I'm from the hood, I shoot this MAC for you
She was thick, light skinned, her name was Constance (brrrr, Constance)
I never got to fuck with her, it still fuck with my conscience (damn)
Every hood got that one bitch (that one bitch)
You always wanted but you never get, that's my Constance (never get)
You called my homegirl but the feeling's deeper (deeper)
Whoever got her she a keeper, she from the hood, she my people

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I told her I'll be right back (right back)
I'll be comin' right back (yeah, ooh)
No, save it for me
Oh, save it for me, yeah
I told her I'll be right back (yeah)
Oh, I'll be comin' right back
She gon', save it for me, yeah
You know she gon' save it for me, yeah
Don't give it up, please don't give it up
It's too good, they don't need to know
All you gotta do is save it for me, oh
She gon' save it for me

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
All these niggas downloadin', tryna steal my sauce
Everybody in my girl DM's, you 'posed to be my dog
But she don't reply to 'em, she send me the screenshot
Just in case, when I pull up you can't lie about it
Beat his ass, with a strap, I wish a nigga would
I love my bad bitch, but I love that chopper too
Poppin' tags, she like shopping bags, look at all her shoes
Ain't no limitations when you popping and you got the juice
All of this money I'm making today, I can see why they hate me
She really love me and she know I'm crazy
But that's still my baby, she the first lady
Sex me too amazing, she say she gon' save it for me

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I told her I'll be right back (right back)
I'll be comin' right back (yeah, ooh)
No, save it for me
Oh, save it for me, yeah
I told her I'll be right back (yeah)
Oh, I'll be comin' right back
She gon', save it for me, yeah
You know she gon' save it for me, yeah
Don't give it up, please don't give it up
It's too good, they don't need to know
All you gotta do is save it for me, oh
She gon' save it for me
