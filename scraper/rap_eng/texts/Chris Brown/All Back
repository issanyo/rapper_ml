[Verse 1]
If I had the moment, I'd capture that moment
You would be right here next to me
If I had the secret, the secret to your love
I would place the treasure beneath my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Lock it all up and throw away the key
I would never give it, it up
Cause I was just a fool, a fool for you
When I loved you so childishly

[Chorus]
And I want it all back, I want it all, I want it all, girl I want it all back
I want it all back, I want it all, I want it all, girl I want it all
You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
I want it all, now I want it all

[Verse 2]
If there is a green light and it starts to turn yellow
Pedal to the floor cause I know your heart is turning red
If I had the minutes, I would turn 'em into hours
And make love to your mind and not your body instead

[Pre-Chorus]
I was just a fool, a fool for you
That didn't know what I had until I lost you
Now every single moment that youâ€™re not here
It's evident to me that everything just seems so clear

[Chorus]
And I want it all back, I want it all, I want it all, girl I want it all back
I want it all back, I want it all, I want it all, girl I want it all
You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
I want it all, now I want it all

[Bridge]
Now everything isn't everything
If everything, everything isn't with you, yeah

[Chorus]
And I want it all back, I want it all, I want it all, girl I want it all back
I want it all back, I want it all, I want it all, girl I want it all
You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
I want it all, now I want it all

[Outro]
Now I want it all back
Now I want it all back
Now I want it all back
