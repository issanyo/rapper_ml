[Intro]
Oh, ooh
One time for them sexy ladies
One time for them sexy ladies
One time for them sexy ladies

[Bridge: Marissa]
Let me hear you one time (one time)
If you a real one, hidden with your own shit, girl (shit, girl)
You got niggas claimin' you his girl (is girl)
But ain't never let 'em hit shit, girl (shit, girl)
Let me hear you one time (one time)
It never fails every time that you with your girls (your girls)
If you wanna pull up on you like you his girl (his girl)
Somebody better tell this fool, I ain't your girl

[Verse 1: Marissa]
Say I got his heart when we flyin' on the highway
It's hard for me to tolerate
How you miss your love? Nigga, you ain't even know me
We only had a dinner date
Gave you a lil' of my time, now you wanna put a ring on her
But you need to know
You ain't even felt it, I felt one stroke, that smoke
Got you askin' me questions I don't answer

[Pre-Chorus: Marissa]
Ah, yeah, you must got me confused with your girl (with your girl)
Ah, 'cause you got a lil taste of it, this ain't hers (this ain't hers)
Ah, ain't no need to get lit, wasn't time for you to get it, can't keep it (get lit, can't keep it)
Every time the phone rings, you wanna get turnt (I wanna get turnt)

[Chorus: Marissa]
I ain't your girl (woo!)
I ain't your girl (woo!)
I ain't your girl
Ah, ain't no need to get lit (get lit)
Wasn't time for you to get it, can't keep it (can't keep it)
Every time the phone rings, you wanna get turnt (I wanna get turnt)
I ain't your girl

[Verse 2: Marissa]
Showed up at the club in the all red Polo
Askin' me a question 'bout a nigga in the photo
Last time I checked, I got no gun in the holster
I just keep mine in the tuck, in the every man coaster
So what that mean? I don't ever show my hand to the popo
So what that mean? I ain't ever wear no shirt with a logo
I leave when I leave, I ain't have to leave no info
I'm 20 years old, nigga, hard as a pistol
European in the drop, nigga, spin that
I won't even pee in the cup, my knees not havin' that
What the fuck you mean you and I? We ain't spend time
We ain't even link in the morn', I don't really know about you

[Bridge: Marissa]
Let me hear you one time (one time)
If you a real one, hidden with your own shit, girl (shit, girl)
You got niggas claimin' you his girl (is girl)
But ain't never let 'em hit shit, girl (shit, girl)
Let me hear you one time (one time)
It never fails every time that you with your girls (your girls)
If you wanna pull up on you like you his girl (his girl)
Somebody better tell this fool, I ain't your girl

[Pre-Chorus: Marissa]
Ah, yeah, you must got me confused with your girl (with your girl)
Ah, 'cause you got a lil taste of it, this ain't hers (this ain't hers)
Ah, ain't no need to get lit, wasn't time for you to get it, can't keep it (get lit, can't keep it)
Every time the phone rings, you wanna get turnt (I wanna get turnt)

[Chorus: Marissa]
I ain't your girl
I ain't your girl
I ain't your girl

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Ah, baby, you got me confused
I ain't playing games with ya
Ah, and by the look on your face
I'm gon' spend the night with you
Ayy, girl, the only thing that I see is your eye
Hey, every time my heart skips a beat you know why (oh, yeah)
Baby, be with  me, I'ma treat you right
So don't try to count me out 'cause I fuck with you the long way

[Pre-Chorus: Marissa & Chris Brown]
Ah, yeah, you must got me confused with your girl (with your girl)
Ah, 'cause you got a lil taste of it, this ain't hers (this ain't hers)
Ah, ain't no need to get lit, wasn't time for you to get it, can't keep it (get lit, can't keep it)
Every time the phone rings, you wanna get turnt (I wanna get turnt)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Marissa]
You ain't my girl, I want it, baby
I ain't your girl
But you driving me crazy
I ain't your girl
Oh woah, yeah, go ahead, damn
