[Verse 1]
I enjoy you
I never wanna see you leave, girl
You've made my life
So complete and I don't
Wanna move too fast, no
'Cause you're too special

[Pre-Chorus]
I really love the way, I do
You make me feel inside
You wonder why my
Spirit is so happy, hey

[Chorus]
You touch my heart, every part, oh
Whenever you speak to me
I love what we, I love have going on
I may never find, I may never find another one like you, for me

[Verse 2]
I have no worries once I step into your presence
You have a way of helping me
See that everything's okay, babe
What else can I say?

[Pre-Chorus]
I really love the way, I do
You make me feel inside
You wonder why my
Spirit is so happy, girl, you

[Chorus]
You touch my heart, oh yes you did, every part
Whenever you speak to me, yes, I love
I love what we, I love have going on, what we got going on, babe
I may never find, I may never find another one like you, for me

[Bridge]
We started out
Saying that we would just be friends
But special feelings have arrisen
What are we supposed to do now here in the mean while?

[Pre-Chorus]
I really love the way, I do, the way, you make me feel inside
You wonder why my, spirit is happy
'Cause you came in and changed the meaning of a true friend
And this is just the beginning

[Chorus]
You touch my heart, every part
Whenever you speak to me, yes I love
I love what we, I love have going on
I may never find, I may never find another one like you, like you, babe for me

[Outro]
I don't wanna waste this opportunity
I may never find another one like you for me
Oh, I may never find
I may never find no one like you, ooh
The odds are not in my favor
I may never find another one like you for me
I gotta savor every moment 'cause of you
It wouldn't be wise
If I let time pass me by
I may never find another one like you for me
'Cause I can't go without you in my life
Hey, I may never find
I may never find another one like you for me
I may never find
I may never find another
