[Verse: Jacquees]
Here me calling, why you won't give me no answers baby?
It's 3 in the morning, the only ones out is the dancers, baby
You and me, baby, little bitch you look bad
Don't worry 'bout how I got your location
You cheating, i'm kicking this table, i'm tryna picture it
So, this middle finger is for every nigga feelin' me
You fucked up my love girl, and fucked up my bed
God damn, no shame, you got no shame

[Pre-Chorus: Jacquees]
Still got your hide away, bring the AK
Chopper outside, just like the 808
I need more bass, you done fucked up
I'm crazy, this house a gun range
Drums rain, bang bang
Gon' do the same, if I let my nuts hang

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jacquees]
You better be gone, better be gone
When I leave at your hide away (way)
And if I found out, you be going where that nigga say
Ooh, if I didn't know it already, but to catch case, ooh
'cause I'm speeding down the highway
Know your location now...

[Verse: Chris Brown]
