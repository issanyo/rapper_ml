[Verse 1]
Baby, why you keep doing shit?
You running from me but you know you gon' get it
I'ma teach you how to love me, want you to be bad right now
I want you to fuck me, yeah, with your sexy ass
I'ma make that devil on me, baby, I'ma get it all, I'ma get it, get it
Your body's calling, lemme break you off, kinky just play along with it
Baby, I'm right here, you know that belongs to me
So put it right here, girl, don't make me

[Chorus]
Don't make me have to tell you again that that's my pussy, baby
You better not give it away way, way, way, way, way
Don't make me have to tell you again that's my pussy, baby
It's mine, girl, it's mine, girl, it's mine, so you better not give it away
So you better not, better not give it away
Better not, better not give it away
Better not, better not give it away
So you better not give it away

[Verse 2]
Girl, I'm fucked up off that good, bitch, I know you see me calling
I'm blowing up your phone, tryna fuck you 'til the morning
That kitty crying tears, I go longer while I'm on the shit
Baby, bring it here, I'ma lick it just how you want it
You got me paying all your bills, fuck around and take care of your kids
Love it when you put that thing on me, hit it from the back and I give you chills
All I want is that pussy, girl, lemme get it
You know I own that cookie, you love it, you love it

[Chorus]
Don't make me have to tell you again that that's my pussy, baby
You better not give it away way, way, way, way, way
Don't make me have to tell you again that's my pussy, baby
It's mine, girl, it's mine, girl, it's mine, so you better not give it away
So you better not, better not give it away
Better not, better not give it away
Better not, better not give it away
So you better not give it away
