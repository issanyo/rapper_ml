[Verse 1]
My baby got a lot to learn
Come here, let mama bring you up to speed
A couple of changes,
A couple of things I want to go over
Couple of hours is all I need
So let's get it started

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when you're touching all over my body
And kissing and licking up on me
I know you wanna beat it up up
But I'm sorry that ain't really my thing
If you take your time then we can do whatever
Whatchu think we in here for?
Baby, we got all night so don't rush it
If you gon get the reaction you want

[Chorus]
Just take it slower
Slower, slower, slower, slower
Don't speed it up boy we can go
Slower, slower, slower, slower, slower

[Verse 2]
Baby, wait a minute
You're closer to the ending
Together we gon finish up
You speed racer, slow down

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when you're touching all over my body
And kissing and licking up on me
I know you wanna beat it up up
But I'm sorry that ain't really my play
If you take your time then we can do whatever
Watchu think we in here for
Baby we got all night so don't rush it
If you gon get the reaction you want

[Chorus]
Just take it slower
Slower, slower, slower, slower
Don't speed it up boy we can go
Slower, slower, slower, slower, slower

[Bridge]
I got a vision of us
And there's a kiss with every touch
If I let you take control
Boy you better make me feel love
You never had nothin' like this
I'm gonna show you a thing or two
And if you ask we can go all night
Speed racer, go slow

[Chorus]
Just take it slower
Slower, slower, slower, slower
Don't speed it up boy we can go
Slower, slower, slower, slower, slower

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when you're touching all over my body
And kissing and licking up on me
I know you wanna beat it up up
But I'm sorry that ain't really my thing
If you take your time then we can do whatever
Whatchu think we in here for
Baby we got all night so don't rush it
If you gon get the reaction you want
(Just take it)
