[Intro: Chris Brown]
Alright now I said I wouldn't gon' trip
I can't even lie, you got me fucked up, shit

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I ain't tryna be rude or stingy
But I ain't tryna share you with another man
You know you got the upper hand
You know you do that shit that I like
I know you teasin' and it's not right
I can't control it when you throw it back
And look me in my eyes, yeah
It's gon' be a long night cause
See these niggas tryna get you to they table
And hit you up later like, "Come over, baby"
But that pussy mine, girl
Know you play a lot of games, but you know I wrote the playbook
Keepin' horses in the stable
Never written all the shit I got paid for
Baby, you better not do it, wish a nigga would
Throwin' this paper

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Please don't dance with everybody
Cause I want all your lovin' to myself
Don't give it to everybody
No baby, please, only me
It ain't for everybody
I'ma go to work when you shake that thing
Do it in front of everybody
Right here, right now, in front of everybody
Oh yeah, everybody
Right here, in front of everybody
Oh, everybody
Right now, in front of everybody

[Verse 2: Young Lo]
Know I ain't the first but I'm tryna be the last though
Might sound selfish, you can blame it on the cash flow
Check the pedigree, I bet it be a list of bad hoes
Mr. Blow A Bag, why they mad? Cause I skrrt off in the Lambo
Rock the latest fashion so they glancin' when I pass through 'em
You don't fuck with everybody, you ain't gotta lie for 'em
Head to the gang, save that for the lames, for the lames
I'm a G like Cane, ball like James
So why you actin' like that?
Cause you're way too fly to be wastin' your time
Why you actin' like that?
Tell me why you wanna be the life of the party

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Please don't dance with everybody
Cause I want all your lovin' to myself
Don't give it to everybody
No baby, please, only me
It ain't for everybody
I'ma go to work when you shake that thing
Do it in front of everybody
Right here, right now, in front of everybody
Oh yeah, everybody
Right here, in front of everybody
Oh, everybody
Right now, in front of everybody

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Do it right now, right in front of everybody
Take that ass down, right in front of everybody
I'ma turn you out, all in front of everybody
Tear that ass up, even if I care about it
Girl, you better than everybody
Don't you let 'em take that pussy from me, he don't care about you
But don't you worry 'bout a damn thing, I got you
I don't care if they see, everybody watchin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Please don't dance with everybody
Cause I want all your lovin' to myself
Don't give it to everybody
No baby, please, only me
It ain't for everybody
I'ma go to work when you shake that thing
Do it in front of everybody
Right here, right now, in front of everybody
Oh yeah, everybody
Right here, in front of everybody
Oh, everybody
Right now, in front of everybody
