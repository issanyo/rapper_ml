[Intro]
Tell me, tell me, yeah, yeah
Oh, woah, ooh

[Chorus]
Tell me what to do, baby
Tell me what to do, baby (yeah)
I just wanna please you right
How you want me to kiss it, babe? Just tell me, girl
Tell me what to do, baby (baby)
Tell me what to do, baby (baby)
Speed it up or take it slow (slow)
So tell me, baby, please 'cause I need to know

[Verse 1]
Naked all over my sofa, ooh yeah
Girl, we couldn't be any closer
You feel me right here, huh (ooh)
And nowhere but right here
Is where you're 'bout to get satisfied
You ain't even gotta go out tonight, let's not kill the moment
Before we do the freaky shit, I bought you roses
Sexy lingerie, you know I know your size

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't get away from me
Girl, I'm about to put in overtime
Sit on my face,  murdered the pussy, so you know you're about to drop the case
But let's not play with time, ooh

[Chorus]
Tell me what to do, baby (come on, come on, come on)
Tell me what to do, baby
I just wanna please you right (right)
How you want me to kiss it, babe? Just tell me, girl (just tell me, girl)
Tell me what to do, baby (baby)
Tell me what to do, baby (baby)
Speed it up or take it slow (slow)
So tell me, baby, please 'cause I need to know

[Verse 2]
Don't play around, you know I stay up in my feelings, baby
And all I want us to do, is just feel it, baby
I don't want to bust first 'cause I want you to get yours
Don't worry, ain't no pressure, baby
Dripping, I'ma make a waterfall
I be painting inside her walls
Got you screaming like, oh woah
Fucking up the way you walk, ooh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't get away from me
Girl, I'm about to put in overtime (oh)
Sit on my face, murdered the pussy, so you know you're about to drop the case
But let's not play with time, ooh

[Chorus]
Tell me what to do, baby (baby)
Tell me what to do, baby (oh, oh, oh)
I just wanna please you right (right)
How you want me to kiss it, babe? Just tell me, girl (just tell me, yeah)
Tell me what to do, baby (baby)
Tell me what to do, baby (baby)
Speed it up or take it slow (slow)
So tell me, baby, please 'cause I need to know

[Verse 3]
Have it any way you want, babe
'Cause I just want to make you cum all over the place, I won't let your drought go to waste
Let the bed shake, let me hit it 'til you get a headache, fuck you the long way
Rock your body, rock your body, put you on top and let you ride it, ooh, oh oh

[Chorus]
Tell me what to do, baby
Tell me what to do, baby
I just wanna please you right (right)
How you want me to kiss it, babe? Just tell me, girl (just tell me, girl, yeah, yeah)
Tell me what to do, baby (baby)
Tell me what to do, baby (baby)
Speed it up or take it slow (slow)
So tell me, baby, please 'cause I need to know
