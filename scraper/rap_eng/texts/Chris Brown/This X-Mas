[Verse 1: Ella Mai & Chris Brown]
I've been thinking 'bout some jiggle bells (ring, ring, ring, ring)
Snow falling on the window-sill (ooh)
Santa baby you can pull ahead, yeah (yeah)
Just make sure you got that thing to give, yeah (I do, baby)
I've been a little naughty but I want to make up for the bad times (oh yeah)
Baking cookies for you, know you wanna taste it, don't you be shy (shy oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai & Chris Brown]
Feeling good yeah, I'm full of cheer (oh)
I've been waiting for them 12 reindeer
Sittin', chillin' under the mistletoe (woo)
Lit the tree, I know you feel the glow (glow, glow glow glow glow)
Santa baby stay a little, don't you rush, we got time (got time)
I wanna take a selfie with you, show the world you're all mine, all mine, yeah

[Chorus: Ella Mai & Chris Brown]
'Cause this Christmas, will be the
First time that I tell you I'm in love with you
But hol' up Santa baby, I got trust issues
I know you gon' be dashing through the snow, down these chimneys
I know you got plans, I just wanna make sure you feel me
'Cause this Christmas, will be the
Greatest time of your life from me
I ain't asking for the diamond rings
I ain't really got a list of expensive things
I just want you to myself while the children sleeps
Santa baby, would you make a little time for me?

[Bridge: Ella Mai & Chris Brown]
Hooray!
Time, boy
Time, sur-prise
What's inside?
Sweet pie
Chestnut, mine
Good times, on your sleigh-ride

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai & Chris Brown]
Feeling good, I'm full of cheer (oh yeah)
I've been waiting for your 12 reindeer (oh yeah)
Sittin', chillin' under the mistletoe (mistletoe)
Lit the tree, I know you feel the glow (glow, glow glow glow glow)
Santa baby stay a little, don't you rush, we got time (I'm all you need, all you need)
I wanna take a selfie with you, show the world you're all mine, all mine, yeah (oh, oh)

[Chorus: Ella Mai & Chris Brown]
'Cause this Christmas, will be the (this Chrismas)
First time that I tell you I'm in love with you (first time)
But hol' up Santa baby, I got trust issues
I know you gon' be (I know you gon' be)
Dashing through the snow, down these chimneys (crashin' down the chimneys)
I know you got plans, I just wanna make sure you feel me (I just wanna make sure you feel me, yeah)
'Cause this Christmas, will be the (this, this, this)
Greatest time of your life from me (ooh, huh)
I ain't asking for the diamond rings (ooh)
I ain't really got a list of expensive things (yeah, ow)
I just want you to myself while the children sleeps
Santa baby, would you make a little time for me? (Time for me)

[Verse 2: Ella Mai & Chris Brown]
Frosty, the snowman, it's cold out today
Hot cocoa is waiting, come get you a taste
On the second day of Christmas, my baby gave to me
Two doves, like to think it's you and me
First day of Christmas, my baby gave to me
Real love and joyful memories

[Chorus: Ella Mai & Chris Brown]
'Cause this Christmas, will be the (hey)
First time that I tell you I'm in love with you
But hol' up Santa baby, I got trust issues (I got)
I know you gon' be
Dashing through the snow, down these chimneys (chimneys)
I know you got plans, I just wanna make sure you feel me
'Cause this Christmas, will be the (it will be)
Greatest time of your life from me
I ain't asking for the diamond rings (no, no)
I ain't really got a list of expensive things (I ain't got)
I just want you to myself while the children sleeps
Santa baby, would you make a little time for me?

[Outro: Ella Mai & Chris Brown]
Ring, ring, ring, ring
Santa baby, would you make a little time for me?
Ring, ring, ring, ring
Santa baby, would you make a little time for me?
Santa baby, would you make a little time for me?
