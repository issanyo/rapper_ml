[Verse 1]
I'm staring at the clock, it's a quarter to three
I'm tossing in my bed 'cause I just can't sleep
'Cause you're not here with me
I'm reaching out for you, I wish I could talk to you
Tryna figure out what's going on with me
I'm used to having all the answers for everything
Oh, girl, I think she is the one
Where is that coming from?

[Chorus]
It's so crazy
Baby, you simply amaze me
So much more than lately
I owe it all to you
All those games, we
Used to play now seems so lame to me
What I'm coming down with feels new to me
All I know is that you are the cure
'Cause I've been diagnosed with love

[Verse 2]
Does anybody know the answer to this question?
'Cause I'm confused, so now I'm opened for suggestions
My heart is talking loud, what is this about?
I'm really changing now, oh
Cleared all the numbers out my phone, done left that whole life alone
Those are two of the symptoms I see
And I believe, oh girl, I am sure
That you are my miracle

[Chorus]
It's so crazy
Baby, you simply amaze me
So much more than lately
I owe it all to you, owe it all to you
All those games, we
Used to play now seems so lame to me
What I'm coming down with feels new to me
All I know is that you are the cure
'Cause I've been diagnosed with love

[Bridge]
Let me hear you say
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na
If anybody feels me, let me see you wave your hands
I'm diagnosed with love
And say, "I'm diagnosed with love"
And let me hear you say
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na
Baby girl 'cause all I know
That you are the cure, baby

[Chorus]
It's so crazy
Baby, you simply amaze me
So much more than lately
I owe it all to you
All those games, we
Used to play now seems so lame to me
What I'm coming down with feels new to me
All I know is that you are the cure
'Cause I've been diagnosed with love

[Outro]
Love 'cause I've been diagnosed with love
'Cause that you are the cure
'Cause I've been diagnosed with love
Put your hands together now
Everybody put your hands together now
You are the cure
'Cause I've been diagnosed with love
