[Intro: Jacquees]
Right, yup
Right, yup
Right, yup
Right, yup
Jacquees sing, yeah, yeah
Hey!

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
I got a crib with a nice view
You and your girls should slide through (slide through)
Wasn't doing shit anyway
Might as well bring your ass here to my place (true)
I got some drink if you want some (yup)
Girl, we live and we on one (alright)
2 on, yeah, we 2 on
Bad bitch singin' to this song (yup)

[Pre-Chorus: Jacquees]
'Cause they know, 'cause they know who we are (right)
We'll be doing that same shit tomorrow (yup)
This that life that we living and that ain't changing (what?)
They just know that we living the life (what?)
These other niggas ain't doin' it right (right)
I'm fucking me a bad one, if her friend like her she can have some, yeah (right, yup)

[Chorus: Jacquees]
This ain't new to a nigga, I've been doing this all my life (what up?)
These hoes be glued to a nigga (what up?)
So I'ma keep doing what I'm doing (straight up)
Blowin' money like it ain't nothin' new (straight up, straight up)
Poppin' bottles like a real nigga do (straight up, straight up)
Really I could give a fuck about you (straight up, straight up)
As long as I'm doin' what I'm doin'

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
My shit jumpin', tell that bitch twerk somethin'
She said she do a private show, but girl, you ain't sayin' nothin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bring that ass over here now, ass up but that head goin' way down (way down)
I been sippin' so you know I'm tryna fuck some
A real nigga so you know I never love none, no

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Jacquees]
'Cause they know, 'cause they know who we are (yup)
We'll be doin' that same shit tomorrow (right)
'Cause that life that we living and that ain't changin'
They just know that we living the life
These other niggas ain't doing it right (yup)
I'm fucking me a bad one, if her friend like her she can have some, yeah

[Chorus: Jacquees & Chris Brown]
This ain't new to a nigga, I've been doing this all my life (what up?)
These hoes be glued to a nigga (what up?)
So I'ma keep doing what I'm doing (straight up)
Blowin' money like it ain't nothin' new (straight up, straight up)
Popping bottles like a real nigga do (straight up, straight up)
Really I could give a fuck about you (straight up, straight up)
(I could give a fuck what you do)
As long as I'm doin' what I'm doin'

[Verse 3: Jacquees]
Got my black girl, all my white girl
I'm a rich nigga with a rich girl
She go to church on Sundays
But you know she change when she see the big face
You wanna smoke, I'ma roll one
Girl, we live and we on one
I'm fuckin' with a bad one
And if your friends like me, I'ma smash em'

[Chorus: Jacquees]
This ain't, this ain't new to a nigga, I've been doing this all my life (what up?) (hey)
These hoes be glued to a nigga (what up?)
So I'ma keep doing what I'm doing (straight up)
Blowin' money like it ain't nothin' new (straight up, straight up)
Poppin' bottles like a real nigga do (straight up, straight up)
Really I could give a fuck about you (straight up, straight up)
As long as I'm doin' what I'm doin', yeah

[Outro: Jacquees]
From the Bay to the A
From the A to LA
Doin' whatcha doin'
Keep doin' whatcha doin', ayy, what, ayy
Gold chain nigga to a ring nigga, ayy
