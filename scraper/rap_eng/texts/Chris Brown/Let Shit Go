[Verse 1]
I'm 'bout to wild out, you think you got the upper hand right now
Gave you a taste of this life, yeah, my bad
Could give a fuck about the love we had
Shut up, bitch, it ain't mean shit
You wanna play with fire, well I'm smokin' gasoline and I can't get no higher
And we all know that you a liar
Shut the fuck up, I don't wanna hear it
Got a nigga tired but whoa, you aren't shit

[Pre-Chorus]
She wouldn't know what to say
If she was in front of my face
Nobody would know her today
If I wasn't makin' them payments
Now you got all this to say
Need to keep it real with yourself
What are you doing?
Why did you do this?
Girl, fuck you, bitch, you think you slick
I'ma do my own thing
I ain't 'bout to pay you no mind
I done did this shit over and over
And I think it's 'bout time I

[Chorus]
Let this shit go
Let this shit go
I gotta let this bitch go
I gotta let this shit go
Let it go

[Verse 2]
How you gon' be wifey when you don't really like me? I ain't fuckin' with no fighting
She be fucking with the swiper but a nigga kinda like it, hella trifflin'
But I can't blame you for it 'cause I did the same shit
And you do the lame shit just like me (yeah, yeah)
Here we go, lay it on the floor, baby
And let me know if you want some more, baby
Doin' the most, it's the same old story
Everybody knows your game, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
She wouldn't know what to say
If she was in front of my face
Nobody would know her today
If I wasn't makin' them payments
Now you got all this to say
Need to keep it real with yourself
What are you doing?
Why did you do this?
Girl, fuck you, bitch, you think you slick
I'ma do my own thing
I ain't 'bout to pay you no mind
I done did this shit over and over
And I think it's 'bout time I

[Chorus]
Let this shit go
Let this shit go
I gotta let this bitch go
I gotta let this shit go
Let it go
