[Verse 1]
We can jet, believe it, I know that you won't
And yes, there's a feeling we both need to know
Let us start now, it's that time
So let's travel and see the lights

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm gonna take you out anywhere you wanna go now
Tell me you ride, to the town where we both can party now

[Chorus]
Drink in London, dance in Paris
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Shout real loud now and let them hear us
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Tonight, night, night, night, night, night, night
Tonight, night, night, night
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Tonight, night, night, tonight, night, night

[Verse 2]
If it's evening, we'll party 'til morning

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm gonna take you out anywhere you wanna go now
Tell me you ride, to the town where we both can party now

[Chorus]
Drink in London, dance in Paris
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Shout real loud now and let them hear us
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Tonight, night, night, night, night, night, night
Tonight, night, night, night
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Tonight, night, night, tonight, night, night
