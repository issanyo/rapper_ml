[Pre-Chorus]
I love it when you tell me shut up
Take it, just do it to me like that
Like how you watching me throw it right back
Feeling good off that liquor, we faded
Just let it go, let it go, tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, I can’t wait to call you daddy
Oh, daddy (do it to you)
Oh, daddy
Baby when we do it rough
I’m screaming daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy

[Verse 1]
My eyes sparkle, ‘cause you’re mine
Guy, skip wine and dine
It's time, for you to lay back and rewind
Wind, just do it baby
Can we take it slow, but baby I don’t care
If it's dangerous, baby you know I ain’t scared
I’ma let you pull my hair, baby I’m ready

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it when you tell me shut up
Take it, just do it to me like that
Like how you watching me throw it right back
Feeling good off that liquor, we faded
Just let it go, let it go, tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, I can’t wait to call you daddy
Oh, daddy (do it to you)
Oh, daddy
Baby when we do it rough
I’m screaming daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy

[Bridge]
But its your love that gets me high, high, high
So lets do whatever for tonight

[Verse 2]
Thats my shit I do that
I take control of it, take control of it
Baddest bitch you knew that
A little crazy and a little tipsy
I'm about to pass out
But for you, I’m about to go and ride it baby
Don't wanna do the usual
Lets make love in your Mercedes
In traffic, green light, boy just go for it
Do gymnastics, I’m nasty, just jump on it
Just jump on it, come baby where you wanna play
Can we take it slow, but baby I don’t care
If it's dangerous, baby you know I ain't scared
I’ma let you pull my hair, baby I’m ready

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it when you tell me shut up
Take it, just do it to me like that
Like how you watching me throw it right back
Feeling good off that liquor, we faded
Just let it go, let it go, tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, I can’t wait to call you daddy
Oh, daddy (do it to you)
Oh, daddy
Baby when we do it rough
I’m screaming daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy

[Outro]
But it's your love that gets me high, high, high
So lets do whatever for tonight, night, night
