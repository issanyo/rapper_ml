[Intro: Chris Brown]
Oh, whoa

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
She said can I vibe with you, baby for a night?
How can I say no to you, baby, you know I can't do that
Can't help my eyes, they glued to you, ooh yeah, aw yeah
Baby, you're so damn fine, I'll prove it to you, yes, I'll prove it to you

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh, I'll show you (I'm gon' show you)
You deserve more (you deserve more)
I see what you be going through (oh)
You ain't gotta hurt anymore 'cause I love you, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I got this, don't worry
And I know God put you here on purpose
Stop it, I know that you nervous (I know)
But you the only one that's worth it (yeah, baby)
I got this, don't worry
And I know God put you here on purpose
I promise, I got this, don't worry (don't worry)
And I know God put you here on purpose

[Verse 2: AGNEZ MO & Chris Brown]
If I get a mirror, would it clear up your view (a little better)?
And when the smoke clear up, I'm still stuck on you (it's on purpose, I)
I haven't felt like this in a while, don't feel like coming down (don't feel like coming down)
Your love's all 'round, boy, I feel you (oh, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: AGNEZ MO & Chris Brown]
You know I deserve more (I'm gon' show you, you deserve more)
You see what I've been going through (oh)
I ain't gotta hurt anymore (hurt anymore)
'Cause you love me, baby, hey, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Both]
I got this, don't worry
And I know God put you here on purpose
Stop, I know that you nervous (I know)
But you the only one that's worth it (yeah, baby)
You said I got this, don't worry
And I know God put you here on purpose
I promise, I got this, don't worry (don't worry)
And I know God put you here on purpose

[Bridge: Chris Brown & AGNEZ MO]
On purp-, on purp-, on purp-, don't worry
And I know God put you here on purpose
Yeah
I got this, don't worry
I got this, don't worry
I got this, don't worry
Don't worry
Ooh
God, God put you here on purpose

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & AGNEZ MO]
Ooh, I'll show you (I'm gon' show you) (I'll show you)
You deserve more (you deserve more) (you deserve more)
I see what you be going through, oh
You ain't gotta hurt anymore 'cause I love you, baby

[Outro: Chris Brown & AGNEZ MO]
Whoa, whoa
'Cause I love you, baby (you, baby, baby)
You're my baby, yeah
Oh baby
You know you are, my baby
You got this, don't worry
Yeah
You got this, don't worry
