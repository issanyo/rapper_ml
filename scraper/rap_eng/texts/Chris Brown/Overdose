[Intro: Chris Brown & AGNEZ MO]
Oh woah, ooh
Oh, oh, eh

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, AGNEZ MO &  Both]
You know why I'm going crazy?
Because of you, only you, I
Hypnotized, you got me mesmerized with the thought of you
I'm in awe of you, oh
She's my medication for my heartbreak
Oh, I need her
She rehabilitates me
But I'm still addicted, yeah, to her

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown &  Both]
Living life blind but my top down, my roof missing
This kind of love only comes around in a lifetime, I can't miss it
This ain't no typical, ordinary scenario
I can't control (you know)

[Chorus: AGNEZ MO, Chris Brown & Both]
When opposites attract, I overdose, yeah, ah (ooh)
I took too much of your love, I overdose, yeah, ah
Girl, your sex is a drug, faded floating
Feeling like, ooh (hey)
Ooh woah, ooh I-I-I-I, I over-I overdose
Ooh-oh-oh I overdose
Every time I do you baby girl, I overdose
I overdose

[Verse 2: Chris Brown, AGNEZ MO &  Both]
You know why I'm going crazy
Because of you only you, I
Hypnotized, you got me mesmerized with the thought of you
I'm in awe of you
He's my medication for my heartbreak
Oh, I need her
She rehabilitates me
But I'm still addicted, yeah, to her

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown &  Both]
Living life blind but my top down, my roof missing
This kind of love only comes around in a lifetime, I can't miss it
This ain't no typical, ordinary scenario
I can't control, you know

[Chorus: AGNEZ MO, Chris Brown & Both]
When opposites attract, I overdose, yeah, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I took too much of your love, I overdose, took too much of your love, I overdose, ah
Girl, your sex is a drug, faded floating
Feeling like, ooh
Ooh woah, ooh I-I-I-I, I over-I overdose
Ooh-oh-oh I overdose, I overdose
Every time I do you, baby girl, I overdose
I overdose

[Outro: AGNEZ MO]
(I just wanna make you feel good)
I'ma be your painkiller
(Oh, I just wanna make you feel good)
Lemme be your painkiller
(Hahahaha, that's what I'm gonna do)
