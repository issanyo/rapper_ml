[Verse 1]
Hey little mama, oh you're a stunner
Hot little figure, yes you're a winner
And I'm so glad to be yours
You are a class all your own
And oh little cutie, when you talk to me
I swear the whole world stops, you're my sweetheart
And I'm so glad that you're mine
You are one of a kind and

You mean to me what I mean to you

Cause if I got you, I don't need money, I don't need cars
Girl, you're my all and

[Chorus]
Oh I'm into you
And girl, no one else would do
Cause with every kiss and every hug
You make me fall in love

With the love of their life who feels
What I feel when I'm
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, girl
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you

Oh girl, I don't want nobody else
Without you, there's no one left then
You're like Jordans on Saturday
I gotta have you and I cannot wait now
Hey, little shawty, say you care for me
You know I care for you, you know that I'll be true
You know that I won't lie, you know that I would try
To be your everything, yeah

With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, oh
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, hey

[Bridge]
And I will never try to deny that you're my whole life
Cause if you ever let me go, I would die so I won't front
I don't need another woman, I just need your all and nothing
Cause if I got that then I'll be straight, baby, you're the best part of my day
And I need you, boo

And there's heart all over the world tonight, hey hey
Said there's heart all over the world tonight, ooh baby
They need it, boo, they need it
They gotta see their boo
Said there's hearts all over the world tonight
Hearts all over the world tonight

[Chorus]
Oh I'm into you
And girl, no one else would do
Cause with every kiss and every hug
You make me fall in love
And now I know I can't be the only one
I bet there's hearts all over the world tonight
With the love of their life who feels
What I feel when I'm
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, girl
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, oh
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Only with you, with you, with you, with you, with you, with you, babe yeah
