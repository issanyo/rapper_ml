[Verse 1]
Am I crazy? Am I foolish?
Just a little too into you, that's for sure, oh babe
What your beauty does to me
Makes me forget about your faults, you do no wrong, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
They say everybody plays the fool sometimes
And if I've got to, I don't mind
I'll be the best damn fool for you, no lie
And girl I lose it every time

[Chorus]
There's something about you, baby and I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby, stuck on you babe
And I might need help, cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid, I'm stuck on stupid for you, look what you do to me

[Verse 2]
It's confusing, how you do it
It's like you take my heart and glue it to your soul, yeah baby
And I'd do anything for you, oh you know that much it's true
Girl I'm so in love, I'm stupid

[Pre-Chorus]
They say everybody plays the fool sometimes
And if I've got to, I don't mind
I'll be the best damn fool for you, no lie
And girl I lose it every time

[Chorus]
There's something about you, baby and I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby, stuck on you babe
And I might need help, cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid, I'm stuck on stupid for you, look what you do

[Bridge]
If you told me to go rock climbing to prove my love to you
You know I would've died trying, got everything to lose
I'm not tryna play it cool
The stupid things I do, I do it for you

[Chorus]
There's something about you, baby and I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby, stuck on you babe
And I might need help, cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid, I'm stuck on stupid for you, look what you do to me
