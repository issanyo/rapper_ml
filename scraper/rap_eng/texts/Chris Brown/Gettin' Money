[Verse 1]
Okay, I walked inside the club with my golds on
These bitches in my V.I.P., you know what goes on
You got me 'bout to take my shirt off, she rollin' tryna party
She said she wanted a threesome, then I meet her girl named Molly
I said, "Oh no, woah woah, damn damn, oh oh"
Her jaw locked, when my balls dropped then she really started to chow down
Her head game is the meanest, it make me a paraplegic
That pill kicked in like third degree and she started havin' a seizure
So what nigga, you gotta attitude, fuck you and your demeanor
I'm partyin' to death, I make a mess, you gotta clean up
Oh my bad 'cause I'm actin' like a peanut
All you see at the top in V.I.P. is these nuts

[Hook]
I'm gettin' money, what's a stack?
You see me gettin' money, what's a stack?
Been gettin' money, what's a stack?
Let me show you how a real nigga throw these racks
Throw these racks
Real nigga throw these racks
Throw these racks
Real nigga throw these racks

[Verse 2]
Okay, I'm outside, niggas hatin', they tryna key my car
They done fucked 'round, made me mad, I'm about to buy the bar
Order more shots, more liquor, more hoes, no niggas
Sneak all 'em in the back door, they packed on pack, they rollin' with us
Damn, my chain might glitter, this boy be from Virginia
And she tell your ass to stop but she don't say that when I'm in her
Haha 'cause I-hi, I kick that shit, my ninja
My cardiac is winter, your shawty is my dinner
I met a bad bitch at the Starbucks
Straight to the telly, that's a star fuck
Tens, fifties and them hunnids
I ain't talkin' numbers, bitch, I'm talkin' money

[Hook]
I'm gettin' money, what's a stack?
You see me gettin' money, what's a stack?
Been gettin' money, what's a stack?
Let me show you how a real nigga throw these racks
Throw these racks
Real nigga throw these racks
Throw these racks
Real nigga throw these racks

[Verse 3]
Look, let me stop the talkin', gon' and pop that shit for daddy
A nigga got his money up, you know I gotta live it up and all my money stacked in my attic
A little belligerent, I'm crazy, I'm coughin' like an asthmatic
And niggas claimin' they bad but bitch nigga, you know I'm the baddest
Shake it, shake it, shake it in my face
Give a damn about your name but I care about your waist, ha
Naked naked, girl, I want your birthday cake
Fuck you talkin' 'bout celibate, we gon' celebrate

[Hook]
I'm gettin' money, what's a stack?
You see me gettin' money, what's a stack?
Been gettin' money, what's a stack?
Let me show you how a real nigga throw these racks
Throw these racks
Real nigga throw these racks
Throw these racks
Real nigga throw these racks
