[Intro: Sean Kingston]
Kingston, Woah
Yeah, yeah, woah now

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
Tell me what you on
Girl, I’m tryna o turn up
You can hear the song
Ooh, I see you whine
I can’t wait to love
Dancing like a soldier
Tonight, I’ma do it how you like it
Ooh, I want you now

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
I know you wanna come my way
I see you, girl, don’t you play
You ain't gotta leave, you can stay
All night
I see you whining, shawty, let me know
Oh, oh, so hold me close and don’t you let me go, no

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Whine up, whine up on me
Oh, whine it, whine it on me
Oh, whine up, whine up on me
Oh, whine it, whine it on me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Oh, tell me what you like
And baby, I’ma do it
I see you came with all your friends
But they’re not moving
And I’m gonna show them how
How much you need romance
And baby, I see what you really need
Let's be honest, ooh, girl

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston &Chris Brown]
I know you wanna come my way (yeah)
I see you girl, don’t you play (yeah)
You ain't gotta leave, you can stay (no)
All night
I see you whining, shawty, let me know
Oh, oh, so hold me close and don’t you let me go, no

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Whine up, whine up on me
Oh, whine it, whine it on me
Oh, whine up, whine up on me
Oh, whine it, whine it on me

[Verse 3: Sean Kingston]
And you’re the only one I want, in this party (you’re the only one)
And when I leave the club, I'll take you away, now
The way you move that waist, don’t hurt nobody (don’t hurt nobody)
Just whine it, whine it, whine it on me

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
I know you wanna come my way
I see you, girl, don’t you play
You ain't gotta leave, you can stay
All night
I see you whining, shawty let me know
Oh, oh, so hold me close and don’t you let me go, no

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
For the gyaldem
Whine up, whine up on me
Oh, whine it, whine it on me
Oh, whine up, whine up on me
Oh, whine it, whine it on me

[Outro: Sean Kingston]
Yeah, whine it, whine up on me
Tell me what you on
Whine it, whine it on me
You can hear the song
Whine it, whine it on me
Yeah, man, turn it up
Kingston, huh
