[Intro]
Yeah
Oh na, na, na

[Verse 1]
Call your phone, you never picking up on the first one
Only time I swallow my pride, when the thirst come
I pick it up when you drop it down, you know I'm on one
You gon' be my baby tonight, let you hold something

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of these shadows
You can't wash away from me
You can't make a woman love you
A little boy can't be a king
Hotter than fever
Out of your mind, so I'm burned away
You think it's all about you
I be so confused 'cause

[Chorus]
You be wasting time, oh
You ain't on my mind, no
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh
You ain't on my mind
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh (yeah, huh)
You ain't on my mind, no
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh
You ain't on my mind
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh

[Verse 2]
All of you bitches be lying to niggas and running a check up
Serving and swerving and fucking on niggas, just fucking their head up
I don’t beat around the bush, I eat it baby, let me help, put them legs up
Let me see you on that Tempur-Pedic, girl, we gon’ be fucking this bed up
Girl, I know you fugazy
And I ain’t gonna waste my time 'cause I know she a hater
And I know she can read my mind but do me a favor
Don’t waste my time

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of these shadows
You can't wash away from me
You can't make a woman love you
A little boy can't be a king
Hotter than fever
Out of your mind, so I'm burned away
You think it's all about you
I be so confused 'cause (huh)

[Chorus]
You be wasting time, oh
You ain't on my mind, no
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh
You ain't on my mind
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh (yeah, huh)
You ain't on my mind, no
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh
You ain't on my mind
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh

[Verse 3]
Ha, they don’t wanna believe a nigga
Put the dick on her, don’t wanna leave a nigga
Take the panties off, on a bitch like a heat missile
My scene jumpin' on my team
Count a hundred million cash on my jeans denim
I got more numbers than your cell phone (cell phone)
Too many bills when the mail come (mail come)
I’m that nigga that they’re scared of (scared of)
‘Cause I’ma take a fade head off
You ain’t gotta listen to a nigga
I like it 'cause I see that change when the money come
I turned to nothin' back into somethin'
Drive with the heat like the end off summer
And girl, you know it's OHB, yeah
Only hot bitches love me 'cause

[Chorus]
You be wasting time, oh
You ain't on my mind, no (oh, oh, ooh)
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh
You ain't on my mind (ooh, ooh)
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh (you’ve been wasting time)
You ain't on my mind, no (yeah)
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh (yeah, yeah, oh, oh)
You ain't on my mind (oh, oh, oh)
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh (ooh)

[Outro]
Wasting time
Ooh
