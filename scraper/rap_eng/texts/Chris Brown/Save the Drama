[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Gun shots, we lots
Hennessy, I don't really like scotch
At the don when I'm talking to the dutch
And the man with the pockets like fam you up
Dippers and the wait notes
Black man says he's hit a lick, better keep your face down
Get loud when that kick sound
You miss it, don't count up
No tops, no tops
Go to collect, we in Paris when we shop
You gotta give the man props
Your girl love a man lots
Fuck it, I'm on that pussy like a rumpa
If I tag her, gotta have her have a bumper
All that pussy got that fire like a dragon
And I know she got that wagon from her mama

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Call it a homicide how she do
The guys in Jamaica, man jealous
Make me terrified
I can tell you skilled cause you using your melody
Oh, no no no no
Light another blunt then we gon' light up the floor
Smoking all that ganja you can smell through the door
Sex tape never, 'less she let me record
And I know where your head's at
Got your attitude from your mama
And I don't wanna set back
Just do me a favor and save the drama

[Verse 2: Tracy T]
Get the baddest bitch and treat it like the worst
Popping the Henny, tripping if you fuck the pussy first
We gon' fuck, I'm gon' fuck or we gon' fall in love
I will get 'em once, fucking, fucking with the plug
Bitches texting, I'm a dog fetching
Bitch I'm on, no flexing, fuck a 100 besties
See that's just for that extra Range, she'd to forget them
Your body's under my belt, just to make it official
I forget that he mission, never forget the pistol
Thinking all the way in, killing and leave the victims
I got trust issues, I might think you tripping
Really I be tripping, rolling with all the spitting
West is, this the gang, bitch you better catch it
'Fore you be over tested, rather pull up in a Bentley
Used to pull up in Chevys, I'm the kind that can get enough
I'm the kind that can get the paper cause I can't get enough nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Call it a homicide how she do
The guys in Jamaica, man jealous
Make me terrified
I can tell you skilled cause you using your melody
Oh, no no no no
Light another blunt then we gon' light up the floor
Smoking all that ganja you can smell through the door
Sex tape never, 'less she let me record
And I know where your head's at
Got your attitude from your mama
And I don't wanna set back
Just do me a favor and save the drama

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Likkle waste girl
Lick her waste girl
Lick di poom poom
Like di taste girl
I done made love in the strangest places
I'm a real plug move thangs on the daily
Like di mon on the moon I'll be safe
Smoke di ganja mi ugh
Everyday
I'm a rider, she a rider
Hold the Glock 9 right on side her
Hit the high notes like Mariah
Body feel electric when the vibe is right
I'm a drug ima get you high tonight
Fall in love with me
Pussy mine tonight
I could see you want me
Pull you closely
Sound on silent
Ignore the phone ring
Deep breath
Hands on knees
Just get it
Real small waist
Fat ass, lil titties
Email please gates don't do digits
Mouth on bling just spent 2 million
Laid back, low key, big lean sippin
S63 coupe yeeee I'm whippin
Heroin trap back street move chickens
New boo thing on fleek roof missin
Chris B hit me, dip thru kick it
Straps on lap
Big shit I give her
Hat to the back
Lot of tats I'm chillin'
Matter of fact
Big racks I give her
Kevin Gates don't hang
Bae stop slippin'
Bullshit make a real nigga lose interest

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh, no no no no
Light another blunt then we gon' light up the floor
Smoking all that ganja you can smell through the door
Sex tape never, 'less she let me record
And I know where your head's at
Got your attitude from your mama
And I don't wanna set back
Just do me a favor and save the drama
