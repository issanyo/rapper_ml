[Intro]
I feel like a monster, whoa
I feel like a monster, whoa
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
(What's wrong with me?)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
(Why do I feel like this?)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
(I'm going crazy now...)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
I feel like a monster, whoa

[Verse 1]
No more gas, in the red
Can't even get it started
Nothing heard, nothing said
Can't even speak about it
All my life on my head
Don't want to think about it
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
It's too close for comfort

[Chorus]
Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise

[Post-Chorus]
Your mind's in Disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
(Your mind is in) Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, Disturbia

[Refrain]
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum

[Verse 2]
Faded pictures on the wall
It's like they talkin' to me
Disconnected, no one calls
The phone don't even ring
I gotta get out
Or figure this shit out
It's too close for comfort, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
I feel like a monster

[Chorus]
Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise

[Post-Chorus]
Your mind's in Disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
(Your mind is in) Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, Disturbia

[Refrain]
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum

[Bridge]
Release me from this curse I'm in
I've been trying to remain tame
But I'm struggling
If you can't go, oh, oh
I think I'm gonna oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise

[Post-Chorus]
Your mind's in Disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
(Your mind is in) Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, Disturbia
