[Verse 1]
Tryin' to fuck with you
Wanna be your man
I wanna be stuck with you
...nobody said, they caught up with you
No reconciling thats dead, and now I'm over you, so

[Chorus]
Pride, that ain't gonna mean nothin'
When I flex on you, flex on you
When I flex on you
Got to love in the bed
When I flex on you
Got you thinkin' 'bout my sex
When I flex on you
