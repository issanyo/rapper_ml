[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I gave you the best that you ever had
Gave you one dose and got you addicted
I could own that, all night and all day
Get you on my plate, girl, you so delicious
Last night we had a real good time gettin' faded
I wake in the morning you gone
It's been on my brain all day replayin'
Like its on record
I miss every minute
I'mma take plenty chances
My love for you is bigger than a mansion
More than you imagine
I want all of your kisses
Mistletoe before Christmas
If you ain't got it, don't get it
If you got time, it's no limit

[Chorus: Jeremih & Chris Brown]
Baby, won't you give me something
That I wanna do?
When I see the sun set
Yeah, I think of you
I think of you
You're all I want too
Left panties by my nightstand
Now I think of you, I think of you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Loving my baby, yeah, you giving me that sweet talk
Love's up and down, it's like living on a see-saw
Do me a favor, baby, why you blaming me for?
All I wanted was love, baby
Last night we had a real good time, we was naked
Bumping and making love
Got me with all these games you playing
It's time for us to grow up
Don't care 'bout winning (yeah, yeah)
Come on, baby, I got the answers (yeah, yeah)
You ain't gotta be a dancer (yeah, yeah)
All I need is your love
Girl, you won't change my mind
And I can see you hesitating
So, baby

[Chorus: Jeremih & Chris Brown]
Baby, won't you give me something, ooh yeah
That I wanna do?
When I see the sun set, oh, girl
Yeah, I think of you, baby
I think of you
You're all I want too
Left panties by my nightstand
Now I think of you, I think of you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I think of you, girl you been on my mine
And all I think of is you, can I have it baby (can I have it baby)
Can I have it baby, gotta have it babe
And girl I need plenty of your love (Alright)
And you its gon be all night, girl take your time
I'mma take a chance if you call baby girl, its a reason why
I'm in love (Love) Girl you know I'm in (Love)
