[Intro]
I'm your supplier

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I'm 'bout to order two bottles of Patron
I'm in the club with 2 models on my arm
I'm drama free, I left my problems at home
I know you mad but so what?

[Pre-Chorus: Keri Hilson]
Tonight I'm kissing you goodbye, you won't see me no more
I'm having the time of my life, you won't see me no more
I got my deuces in the sky, you won't see me no more
You won't see me no more, you won't see me no more

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm on some new, deuces
I'm on some new, deuces
I'm on some new, deuces
Deuces
You make me wanna say
You make me wanna say, deuces
You make me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye
Say bye bye to her

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I'm at the bar with a drink in my hand
Feel like a star 'cause I just came here to dance
I party hard, take 2 shots to the head
I put the bullets in the chamber

[Pre-Chorus: Keri Hilson]
Tonight I'm kissing you goodbye, you won't see me no more
I'm having the time of my life, you won't see me no more
I got my deuces in the sky, you won't see me no more
You won't see me no more, you won't see me no more

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm on some new, deuces
I'm on some new, deuces
I'm on some new, deuces
Deuces
You make me wanna say
You make me wanna say, deuces
You make me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye
Say bye bye to her

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Comin' live from the 804
In the party, in the party I go
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world
And it's a party everywhere I go
Your hands in the air
2 fingers up
Forget your problems
Let's turn it up
Dale, mami, as go to you
Come and party with papi chulo
Got what you want and want you need
Throw them deuces up, 2 more bottles please

[Verse 4: Keri Hilson]
Tell the waiter bring more bottles, I need more, more, more
But there's a big fat policeman at the door, door, door
And if you catch you by the collar, just throw him a few dollars
Tell the waitress bring the bottles, I need more, more, more

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm on some new, deuces
I'm on some new, deuces
I'm on some new, deuces
Deuces
You make me wanna say bye
You make me wanna say, bye
You make me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye
Say bye bye to her
