[Intro]
Now what I do?
So what I do?
Better tell 'em what I do
When it comes to this dance shit, I know how to move

[Verse 1]
I'm a fresh kid, check my style meter
Fresh to death kid, call me soul eater
I make 'em drop it low, they do my dance all on the floor
Into the floor cave in then I'm out of the door
I must be outta my head like my brains scrambled like eggs
Get the cameras off me, nigga, hop up off me, nigga, hop up off my dick
My style is super sick and there are no competitors
And they can't see 'cause they they the prey and I'm the predator
I, I rock, I'm the shit, you turds
Check my iPod, I'm such a fuckin' nerd
I'm flyin' higher than the fire on these sirens
When the plane is slowly divin', I guess I'm blowin' sky high then

[Pre-Hook]
Lemme see that ass on the floor
If I give it you, I know you gon' want more
I don't even see how you can do that on your toes
On your mark, get ready, ready, set, let go, I think I'ma

[Hook]
She going, ah
She going, ah
She going, ah
She going, ah
She gotta curvy lil booty and she throw it back
And when she throw it back, I gotta throw a rack
She going, ah
She going, ah
She going, ah
She going, ah
She gotta curvy lil booty and she throw it back
And when she throw it back, I gotta throw a rack

[Pre-Hook]
Lemme see that ass on the floor
If I give it you, I know you gon' want more
I don't even see how you can do that on your toes
On your mark, get ready, ready, set, let go, I think I'ma

[Hook]
Hit it, hit, hit
She gon', she gon' lemme
Hit it, hit it, leggo
Hit it, leggo
I think she gon', gon', gon', gon' let me
Get it, let me get it
Hit it, hit it

[Outro]
Stop, I'm on that
My motherfuckin' got that block
I'm on that, I told her, tell her
Tell her
Haha, nigga
Haha, nigga
Hahahaha, nigga
I'm on, I'm on
I told her, yup
Is that right?
I'm the coldest here
What the fuck ya talkin'? Got my chandelier
Air hold me down 'cause I'm dimin' here like
Clap for me, bitch
Clap for me, bitch
