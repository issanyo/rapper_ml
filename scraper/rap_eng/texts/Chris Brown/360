[Intro: Kevin McCall]
Cuff your chick
DJ, you told me they was gon' switch it up on me
DJ Ill Will
First they was laughin' at me
But now every time they turn on the radio
What they hear? K-K-K-K-K-Mac
Yeah, that's right, we takin' over
It's B.U.F, Blowin' Up Fast
Shit, you never know
I might be that motherfucker

[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
I went from EBT to BET, I guess I had my words crossed (uh)
First she wasn't fuckin' with a pimp, now it's her loss
'Cause she ain't want me when, I ain't have no ends
But that was short-lived, hahaha, Gary Coleman
I'm on my grind like that skater named Terry (huh?)
Kennedy my enemies, no death never scare me (ah)
Death where is thy sting, grave where is thy victory (ah, ah)
They don't remember you 'til you're dead, look at history
But I'ma make sure these niggas remember me
Start a family legacy, for everyone that's kin to me
See I'ma paint a portrait so vividly (yeah)
Even if you got Alzheimer's, ain't no forgettin' me
Eastside, 97th and town
That's where you find wine C Locs puttin' it down
I'm just tryna make my loved ones proud
So I'm livin' like I'm writin' my obituary now

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
First they wouldn't holla
Now they on me, on me, on me
See a nigga shinin'
Now they actin' like they know me
Niggas do it, do it
And they try to call me phony
I ain't never been your friend
You ain't never been my homie
No, so be careful 'cause you never know
You might be the next one to blow
So before you try to judge me
Thinkin' you above me
I might be that motherfucker

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You won't break me tonight, no tonight, not tonight (no, no)
'Cause I see straight through the lies, no disguise in your eyes (hey!)
I know you niggas hate it, you hate us 'cause we made it (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So watch me do it, do it, won't stop 'til I'm the greatest (brap, brap, brap)

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Motherfuckin' go, I lead in the ropes
Nigga dope, nigga ball, I ain't never had a coach
Well spoke, no spokes, West Coast, fuckin' loc
Let my engine bang on 'em like Jehovah's at your door
T-Raw, Last Kings on my drawers
I'm a diaper, shit talk, carpet, piss on 'em like a dog
Shake my log, yeah, it's large, I ain't even gotta flaunt
Motherfuckin' mack daddy, take your bitch and your moms now 'cause first they

[Chorus: Kevin McCalll & (Tyga)]
First they wouldn't holla (yeah)
Now they on me, on me, on me (yeah)
See a nigga shinin'
Now they actin' like they know me (I know, I know, nigga)
Niggas do it, do it
And they try to call me phony (bitches, they see me)
I ain't never been your friend
You ain't never been my homie (yeah)
No, so be careful 'cause you never know (no, money)
You might be the next one to blow (K-Mac)
So before you try to judge me (Tyga)
Thinkin' you above me (Breezy)
I might be that motherfucker (ooh)

[Outro: Kevin McCall]
We ain't had to do 'em like that though
See look, first you didn't wanna let me in the club
Now you want me to host that motherfucker
Ha, aight but you gotta pay me
See look, next time somebody act Hollywood on you
And you know you the next to blow
Don't even trip, just say this to yourself
I might be that motherfucker
