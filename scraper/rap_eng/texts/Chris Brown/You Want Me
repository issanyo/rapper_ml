[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I bring the party
Got just what you need to hit the floor
Girl I like ya body
You wanna leave yo man and I know it
(So come on, DJ Babey Drew)
I bring the party
Got just what you need to hit the floor
Girl I bring the party
Got just what you need to hit the floor
Girl I like ya body
You wanna leave yo man and I know it

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Se7en]
So you know you love me, ah, you want me don't you?
You know you love me, you got to move, you got to move
You got to move, there's no time to waste
The time is now or never, girl break me off some shawty
All the beautiful ladies in the party I know you want me
I'mma make ya go crazy, I just started, I know you want me
I'm on the floor now, can't escape it girl
I-I-I I know you want me, I-I-I I know you want me

[Verse 2: Se7en]
I bring the party
Got just what you need to hit the floor
Girl I like your body
You wanna leave yo man and I know it

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Se7en]
So you know you love me, ah, you want me don't you?
You know you love me, you got to move, you got to move
You got to move, there's no time to waste
The time is now or never, girl break me off some shawty
All the beautiful ladies in the party I know you want me
I'mma make ya go crazy, I just started, I know you want me
I'm on the floor now, can't escape it girl
I-I-I I know you want me, I-I-I I know you want me
