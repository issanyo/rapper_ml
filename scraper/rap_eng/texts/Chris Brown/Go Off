[Chorus]
Wanna see you wind it
Ima get up behind it
Loving the way you shake it like that
Don't be shy girl, go off
Go and do it like its nobody around
Baby just show off, you gotta do it when you got it like that, go off

[Verse 1]
I ain't gon make you do something you don't wanna do
All i want you to do is take your time, right here right now
I know you feel it, trust me girl i feel it too
If you get a lil crazy its alright
And I'm hoping that you don't mind how I'm looking at you moving
You got me thinking about your thighs and lifting up your legs
Just wait a minute girl
One more time just do that dance, just do that dance
Girl that booty bouta make a nigga fall in love
You coming home with me when we leave the club, but first off

[Chorus]
Wanna see you wind it
Ima get up behind it
Loving the way you shake it like that
Don't be shy girl, go off
Go and do it like its nobody around
Baby just go off, you gotta do it when you got it like that, go off
Go off, go off, go off, you gotta do it when you got it like that, go off
Wanna see you wind it
Ima get up behind it
Loving the way you shake it like that
Don't be shy girl, go off
Go and do it like its nobody around
Baby just show off, you gotta do it when you got it like that, go off
