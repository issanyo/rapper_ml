[Intro]
Yeah, huh, listen

[Verse 1]
Man I got her, lucky
Look what I've stumbled upon
A woman that sees me for me
Not what I've done
You give me this feeling
Willing to give you my time
Girl, you make me feel like everything's alright
You're sorta like

[Pre-Chorus]
Hearing the birds chirping in the morning light
Or maybe even receiving a kiss goodnight
Girl, you got me believing we just might
End up being more than just two friends

[Chorus]
When we're together, it feels ideal
The sunny weather puts a smile right on my face
So why would I ever turn my back on what we had?
Oh girl, you always bring that first day of spring

[Verse 2]
We kept things friendly
Without crossing that boundary
Darling, I'm expressing
Are you listening?
You give me that feeling
Willing to give you my time
Girl, you make me feel like everything's alright
You're sorta like

[Pre-Chorus]
Hearing the birds chirping in the morning light
Or maybe even receiving a kiss goodnight
Girl, you got me believing we just might
End up being more than just two friends

[Chorus]
When we're together, it feels ideal
The sunny weather puts a smile right on my face
So why would I ever turn my back on what we had?
Oh girl, you always bring that first day of spring

[Bridge]
I can feel the flowers blooming up
Under us, smell the plush fragrance
Winter time is over, there is no other
I would rather spend my time with than you

[Chorus]
When we're together, it feels ideal
The sunny weather puts a smile right on my face
So why would I ever turn my back on what we had?
Oh girl, you always bring that first day of spring
