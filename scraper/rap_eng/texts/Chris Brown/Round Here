[Verse 1]
Boom bam, I know you wanna give me some
Since your boy blown up like a bubble gum
Best believe I'm known to get gutta with it
Your booty's a bubble, I'ma call you my bubblicious
Straight from the gutta, I ain't stutta, I'm gutta with it
So come and get it like you wanted
To get it since "Yo (Excuse Me Miss)"
I'm a keep it bouncing like six, four, rolling through your hood

[Chorus]
Ruhh-ruhh-riding
Ruhh-ruhh-riding
Need to find 'em
Need to find one, she a fly one
Ruhh-ruhh-riding
Ruhh-ruhh-riding
Need to find 'em
Need to find one, she a fly one
Round here, shorty got Tims and 'em bangas
Black bandana wrapped round her ankles
Round here, shawty got swagger
Plus she got attitude, I ain't mad at you
Round here, so baby, don't stop that
From her mama she probably got back
Round here, from CA to BK, from BK to VA
From VA to Harlem, round here

[Verse 2]
Oh damn, I know you gotta feel me son
'Cause I'ma sit round here like a tommy gun
It's gon' blast in your ear
I'ma make you see, it's me repping for the streets
And I heard you want it, baby
It's nice feeling your ice, grilling me crazy
Shawty in the front seat
Straight tripping tryna go for my heat

[Chorus]
Ruhh-ruhh-riding
Ruhh-ruhh-riding
Need to find 'em
Need to find one, she a fly one
Ruhh-ruhh-riding
Ruhh-ruhh-riding
Need to find 'em
Need to find one, she a fly one
Round here, shorty got Tims and 'em bangas
Black bandana wrapped round her ankles
Round here, shawty got swagger
Plus she got attitude, I ain't mad at you
Round here, so baby, don't stop that
From her mama she probably got back
Round here, from CA to BK, from BK to VA
From VA to Harlem, round here
Ruhh-ruhh-riding
Ruhh-ruhh-riding
Need to find 'em
Need to find one, she a fly one
Ruhh-ruhh-riding
Ruhh-ruhh-riding
Need to find 'em
Need to find one, she a fly one
Round here
