[Verse 1]
Leggo, where the bar at? Tell me where the bar at
'Bout to buy the whole club, where my credit card at?
Money flying in the air, look at what I started
Asses clapping up in here, damn it's like an audience
And she bringing all her friends, I'll be your sea-saw
She about to act an ass, hee haw
Got a stupid monkey, fatter then King Kong
It's like a pistol on you, take it all off
You gon' need an ambulance
After you get done with this hammer in my pants
Make it stand up, watch it dance
All mouth, no hands

[Chorus]
I try to told you niggas, I'm the greatest
You bitch made, haters
Shoes crocodile, fuck 'gators
Ain't no need to talk, nigga pay us
I'm 'bout to go, go, go loco
Go, go, my nigga just crazy
Go, go I'm 'bout to go loco
Go, go that nigga just crazy

[Verse 2]
Look, oh damn my liver, damn I got the shivers
My family got that bomb weed, but all I need is liquor
And then she got that butt, thicker than a Snickers
And shawty got that fire, so I popped her like a blister, ew
I know you think I'm losing it, but why you speed balling?
Nigga I am cruising, bitch, nigga we balling
And when my tattoos come to life
Hoes in your head, out of mind, out of sight
That's why they call me Breezy, baby, cold as ice
Boy don't you make me paint a portrait, rearrange your life
All my kicks fly, they Power Ranger Nikes
I'm the shit nigga, ain't gotta say it twice
Tony the tiger, call me Tony
Cause everything's is great, way she twerking it on me
Boy I ain't no kin to ya, I am from Virginia
804 nigga let go, man they can't get rid of us

[Chorus]
I try to told you niggas, I'm the greatest
You bitch made, haters
Shoes crocodile, fuck 'gators
Ain't no need to talk, nigga pay us
I'm 'bout to go, go, go loco
Go, go, my nigga just crazy
Go, go I'm 'bout to go loco
Go, go that nigga just crazy
