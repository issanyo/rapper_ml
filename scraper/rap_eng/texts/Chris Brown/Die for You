[Verse 1]
Murder, murder she wrote
My blood spills all over the pages
And my last breath is a quote
I say that I love you, my dying wish is can you hold me close?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going six feet underground, where you left me
I'm going deep hope I don't drown 'cause you’re air, baby
Girl, you a stone cold killer
And I'ma need a body bag, pulling on my zipper

[Chorus]
Now I'm floating to the other side, with all the lies in your eyes
All these tears are coming down, now you realise, you committed a homicide
Baby, you had the gun and then you pulled the trigger, one shot put me down
So now I'm floating on the other side, for you I do or die
I drink, I smoke, I cry, I die for you
I drink, I smoke, I cry, I die for you
I drink, I smoke, I cry, I die for you
I drink, I smoke, I cry, I die for you

[Verse 2]
Baby, don't hold back, don't hold back
It’s your chance, if you can, if you take my life away
It’s my life in your hands
And girl, I need mouth to mouth, baby, I need CPR

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going six feet underground, where you left me
I'm going deep hope I don't drown 'cause you’re air, baby
Girl, you a stone cold killer
And I'ma need a body bag, pulling on my zipper

[Chorus]
Now I'm floating to the other side, with all the lies in your eyes
All these tears are coming down, now you realise, you committed a homicide
Baby, you had the gun and then you pulled the trigger, one shot put me down
So now I'm floating on the other side, for you I do or die
I drink, I smoke, I cry, I die for you
I drink, I smoke, I cry, I die for you
I drink, I smoke, I cry, I die for you
I drink, I smoke, I cry, I die for you

[Bridge]
Hold on, heavenly father, let me get back to my love
I wanna hold on, I don't wanna leave
Girl, I want to stay here ’til the end of life until for me
Girl, I wanna learn to love, how to love, deep in the clouds tryna come down, now my love

[Chorus]
Now I'm floating to the other side, with all the lies in your eyes
All these tears are coming down, now you realise, you committed a homicide
Baby, you had the gun and then you pulled the trigger, one shot put me down
So now I'm floating on the other side, for you I do or die
I drink, I smoke, I cry, I die for you
I drink, I smoke, I cry, I die for you
I drink, I smoke, I cry, I die for you
I drink, I smoke, I cry, I die for you
