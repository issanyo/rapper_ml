[Chorus: Cal Scruby]
Ain't shit changed but the chain and the watch
We gon' make it rain, switchin' lanes in the drop
One red, one blue like we came with the cops
Yeah, it's goin' down but we stand at the top (We stand at the top)

[Verse 1: Cal Scruby]
They open up the door for me (Door for me)
Like it's the king comin' through, bitch (Through, bitch)
There's a whole lot more of us (More of us)
Yeah, that's my team comin' through, bitch
Creepin' through the city in a matte black (Matte black)
Jaguar purr like a black cat
One on one, bitch, you can't match that (Match that)
She told me, "The money where you lack at"
Scratch that, shorty, hit the lotto (Hit the lotto)
In the club pourin' black Ace out a gold bottle
I ain't tryna be a role model (Role model)
Every day I do the same thing (Huh)

[Chorus: Cal Scruby & Chris Brown]
Ain't shit changed but the chain and the watch
We gon' make it rain, switchin' lanes in the drop
One red, one blue like we came with the cops
Yeah, it's goin' down but we stand at the top (We stand at the top)
Ain't shit changed but the chain and the watch (Yeah)
We gon' make it rain, switchin' lanes in the drop (Alright)
One red, one blue like we came with the cops (Ha! Cal, I see you, my nigga)
Yeah, it's goin' down but we stand at the, at the top

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Ain't shit changed but the chain and the watch (Watch)
Since I got the fame, I better aim with the Glock (Bop!)
Got your girl in the Range, another bitch in the drop (Drop)
I'm 'bout to fuck 'em both, anybody wanna watch? (Haha!)
In the white Ghost with the .40 cal, me and Cal (Huh)
Bitches trippin' 'cause we tippin' now, smokin' with the windows down (Woo!)

You know, boy, I'm gettin' paid, what you say? Money on the way
Bitches actin' fake in my face, wantin' to stay with me (Huh!)

Lonely, I'm big league playin' for the Majors (Ow!)

[Chorus: Cal Scruby]
Ain't shit changed but the chain and the watch

[Verse 3: Cal Scruby]
She can make it clap for me (Clap for me)
But I ain't on stage, ho (Stage, ho)
She tryna get a rack from me (Rack from me)
But I ain't wanna save hoes (Nah)
Cut these bitches off, I ain't cuffin' (I ain't cuffin')
I can make a top drop, I ain't have to press a button (Nah)
She only see the crib if she fuckin' (If she fuckin')
If she bring her friend too, I ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Woah)
Came from the country then moved to the city
And flew out the country to switch up my views (Woah)
You cannot do half the shit that I do
In the coupe, I'm a dog with no roof

[Chorus: Cal Scruby]
Ain't shit changed but the chain and the watch
We gon' make it rain, switchin' lanes in the drop
One red, one blue like we came with the cops
Yeah, it's goin' down but we stand at the top (We stand at the top)
Ain't shit changed but the chain and the watch
We gon' make it rain, switchin' lanes in the drop
One red, one blue like we came with the cops
Yeah, it's goin' down but we stand at the, at the top
