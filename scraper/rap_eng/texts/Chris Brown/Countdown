[Chorus]
Lights out, countdown, want you to take it off right now
It's the countdown, 'bout to wear you out
I just want to get up in it like yeah
Lights out, countdown, want you to take it off right now
It's the countdown, 'bout to wear you out

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna get it to you, Ms. Lady
All up in your house, fuck you on your couch, take you to the bed I know you're lazy
And then we go up and down, you're screamin' out that, "This dick amazin'"
And you gon' make a nigga wanna cuff you when you put me in a cage
And I'ma turn that ass out tonight and I'll put all my money on it
Know you know my girl modest so we fuckin' 'til the mornin'
You're dirty, watchin' me put it on your body
Baby, lemme turn the lights down

[Chorus]
Lights out, countdown, want you to take it off right now
It's the countdown, 'bout to wear you out, I just want to get up in it like yeah
Lights out, countdown, want you to take it off right now
It's the countdown, 'bout to wear you out

[Verse 2]
I'ma get all up in Ms. Lady
And I be kissin' and lickin' on your body and you can ride me 'cause you know this dick stupid, ain't it?
And I'ma roll a red carpet out for that pussy, make that pussy famous
And if your nigga trippin', I'ma chip in and fuck around and make them payments
Girl, what time you want me to pull up to your house? I'll slip in when he step out
He go out partyin' with his boys and I be partyin' in your mouth
Gon' head now kiss her, his breath smellin' like liquor
I don't care if you get her, I'ma always be that nigga when it's

[Chorus]
Lights out, countdown, want you to take it off right now
It's the countdown, 'bout to wear you out, I just want to get up in it like yeah
Lights out, countdown, want you to take it off right now
It's the countdown, 'bout to wear you out

[Bridge]
Please don't make it easy 'cause I want you, all night
And you got something to teach me
And baby, when I get it
I'ma get in it and I'ma make love, love

[Chorus]
Lights out, countdown, want you to take it off right now
It's the countdown, 'bout to wear you out, I just want to get up in it like yeah
Lights out, countdown, want you to take it off right now
It's the countdown, 'bout to wear you out
