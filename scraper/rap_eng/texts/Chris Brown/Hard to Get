[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
I can search far and wide looking for my baby
In the sky, mountain high, I’m gonna find my baby, oh, oh
'Cause I’m in it for the change, you can call me crazy
But we’ll be together, don’t take forever

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin McCall]
I don’t wanna hear you saying, catch me if you can, can
I just wanna hear you saying, saying I'm your man, man
Girl, you got me like Marco Polo
I'ma find you, no matter where you go, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She’s tryna run from me but I know I’ve got her
'Cause shawty can’t run from love
She’s playing hide and seek but I know I'll find her
'Cause shawty can’t run from love
She's playing hard to get, oh she's playing hard to get
She's playing hard to get, oh she's playing hard to get
Shawty can't run, shawty can’t run from love

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
I don’t know what you’ve been told 'bout me
But I suppose that you should know one thing
Anything I want I'll get it and I want you, girl
So, baby, what you say, do you still wanna play hard to get?

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin McCall]
I don’t wanna hear you saying, catch me if you can, can
I just wanna hear you saying, saying I'm your man, man
Girl, you got me like Marco Polo
I'ma find you, no matter where you go, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She’s tryna run from me but I know I’ve got her
'Cause shawty can’t run from love
She’s playing hide and seek but I know I'll find her
'Cause shawty can’t run from love
She's playing hard to get, oh she's playing hard to get
She's playing hard to get, oh she's playing hard to get
Shawty can't run, shawty can’t run from love
