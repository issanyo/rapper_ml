[Verse 1]
Alright, your body's an isosceles, alright
And I'm just tryna try angles, okay
Your love is trigonometry, yeah
Just tryna solve the whole equation

[Pre-Chorus]
What's it about you, about? I wanna love you
Figure you out, figure you out, so I can touch you
Should we do that? Can I do that baby?
Answers are usually in the back

[Chorus]
Substitution, add me in
Multiply my love, is that too much?
Substitution, what's the problem, girl?
Add me in
Baby, just add me, baby, just add me in
Baby, just add me, baby, just add me in

[Verse 2]
I'll calculate her home invasion, yeah, add it up
Divide your legs and count to 3, 3,2,1, come on
He's just not the answer, baby
And that's just my hypothesis, real talk, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
What's it about you, about? I wanna love you
Figure you out, figure you out, so I can touch you
Should we do that? Can I do that baby?
Answers are usually in the back

[Chorus]
Substitution, add me in
Multiply my love, is that too much?
Substitution, what's the problem, girl?
Add me in

[Bridge]
What if I said I loved you, love you baby?
I need you, would you care?
So many things that I could learn
And baby, if we do the math, it will equal up to me instead of him

[Chorus]
Substitution, add me in
Multiply my love, is that too much?
Substitution, what's the problem, girl?
Add me in
Substitution, add me in
Multiply my love, is that too much?
Substitution, what's the problem, girl?
Add me in
Baby, just add me, baby, just add me in
Baby, just add me, baby, just add me in
Baby, just add me, baby, just add me in
Baby, just add me, baby, just add me in
