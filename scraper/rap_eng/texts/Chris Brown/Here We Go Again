[Verse 1]
Scattered thoughts, scattered brains
What you know about it baby? What you know about it baby?
Scattered thoughts, scattered brains
What you know about it baby? What you know about it baby?
I've been running round in circles
And I keep coming back to no one to find
And I've been dealing with these women
So confused on these feelings, so I leave them behind
I've been tryna find different
But really what's the difference when they seem too alike?
Then she end up in my bed, something that I said
Then she thought she was mine

[Chorus]
Are you still down baby? Still down baby?
Are you really 'bout that life? Are you really 'bout that life?
Are you still down baby? Still down baby?
Is you down for the ride? Is you down for the ride?
Here we go again, here we go again
Why can't you let it go? Cause I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fight
Here we go again, here we go again
Oh who could love you better? Oh I could love you better

[Verse 2]
I've been tryna do better
But all of my habits got me changing my mind, changing my mind
One day I wanna love ya
Next day I'm feeling off like I'm loving you blind, girl I'm loving you blind
I wish my heart could be stable
But itâ€™s so damn unable
Guess I'm just not ready
Just not ready for you, woah yeah

[Chorus]
Are you still down baby? Still down baby?
Are you really 'bout that life? Are you really 'bout that life?
Are you still down baby? Still down baby?
Is you down for the ride? Is you down for the ride?
Here we go again, here we go again
Why can't you let it go? Cause I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fight
Here we go again, here we go again
Oh who could love you better? Oh I could love you better

[Bridge]
I won't lie baby, I won't lie baby
I said I won't lie baby, who could love you better?
I won't lie baby, I won't lie baby
I said I won't lie baby, who could love you better?
Let the gun down baby, the gun down baby
Just let the gun go baby
Gun go baby, gun go baby, just like the gun go baby
Don't do it girl

[Chorus]
Here we go again, here we go again
Why can't you let it go? Cause I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fight
Here we go again, here we go again
Oh who could love you better? Oh I could love you better
