[Verse 1]
Baby tonight it's gonna get nasty
I want you at the tip of my tongue, all down your body, no
My face is your pony ooh, and I want you to ride it
So I can drink your rivers down, you quench my thirst babe, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm taking your lace panties off you, gripping your thighs, oh no
It's gon' be the greatest sex you ever had in your life

[Chorus]
Tell me who gon' love you like me? Nobody
Who gon' touch you like me? Nobody baby
Who's gonna fuck you like Breezy? Nobody
Nobody yeah, say oh, you make me say oh

[Verse 2]
Climb up on my mountain, oh 'til I reach your valley
Damn your walls they fit like a glove, 'til you rain on me, yeah
Sending us in slow grind, feels so good I make her morning cry
I'mma grab your waist and pick that ass up and make you lose control

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm taking your lace panties off you, gripping your thighs, oh no
It's gon' be the greatest sex you ever had in your life

[Chorus]
Tell me who gon' love you like me? Nobody
Who gon' touch you like me? Nobody baby
Who's gonna fuck you like Breezy? Nobody
Nobody yeah, say oh, you make me say oh

[Bridge]
I'm the type of nigga fuck up your life once I get in the pussy
Cause I hang with them killers that really be shooting
You don't answer my call, I'mma hop out them bushes
And I creep to your window like "Fuck is you doing?"
I'm feeling like a stalker, girl you know I'm crazy, that pussy amazing
I dive in your waters, let me get you 'til the morning
I say you be popping your pussy, you tell me you innocent
I know when I see friends with benefits
You know my Cartier frames got limo tints
But I can see through the attitude and silly shit
Girl no don't do that no more, took her out the car, right on the hood
We  was fucking like animals, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell me who gon' love you like me? Nobody
Who gon' touch you like me? Nobody baby
Who's gonna fuck you like Breezy? Nobody
Nobody yeah, say oh, you make me say oh
