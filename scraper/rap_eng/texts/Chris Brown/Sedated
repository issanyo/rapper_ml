[Verse 1]
Baby, you got my head up under water
Holding my breath, it's getting harder to do
28 hours I been waiting for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Got you all in my veins, I'm feigning, baby
Got me feeling crazy, I'm a little hazy
All I need is a taste, I need it, baby
Every time you walk away

[Chorus]
You know what to do, one more night and I have to be sedated
Girl, I'm faded, ooh, you got me baby
You know what to do, one more night and I have to be sedated, Girl, I'm faded, sedated
Woo, sedated
Woo
Woo, sedated
Woo

[Verse 2]
Got me on my knees like you're my religion
Can trust me, I need supervision
Ain't no controlling what I'm feeling
Controlling what I'm feeling, feeling

[Pre-Chorus]
Got you all in my veins, I'm feigning, baby
Got me feeling crazy, I'm a little hazy
All I need is a taste, I need it, baby
Every time you walk away

[Chorus]
You know what to do, one more night and I have to be sedated
Girl, I'm faded, ooh, you got me baby
You know what to do, one more night and I have to be sedated, Girl, I'm faded, sedated (Oh baby)
Woo, got me sedated, yeah
Woo, girl, give me what I want, yeah, ooh, yeah
Woo, sedated, oh woah
Woo, yeah, woah, girl
You know what to do, one more night and I have to be sedated
Girl, I'm faded, ooh, you got me baby
You know what to do, one more night and I have to be sedated, Girl, I'm faded, sedated
Woo, sedated
Woo
Woo, sedated
Woo
