[Verse 1]
My mind's wide open but my eyes wide shut
Blinds wide open but the sun still tucked
Tryna put it in before this girl wakes up
Cause when she wake up, she just talk too much

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling, what a feeling
When you diving into meet the one you love
Falling, this not what I'm dong
See girl my mind's wide open but my eyes wide shut

[Chorus]
Gimme what I'm asking for, I just want your sex
Gimme what I'm asking for, I just want your sex
Gimme just a little more, girl I just want your sex
It would mean a lot to me, don't talk back girl, gimme that sex, your body

[Verse 2]
I lay awake while I sleep with her
She say she love me but I don't be believing her
Use me girl, that's what I prefer
I could be, I could be your everything, everything girl I could be

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling, what a feeling
When you diving into meet the one you love
Falling, this not what I'm dong
See girl my mind's wide open but my eyes wide shut

[Chorus]
Gimme what I'm asking for, I just want your sex
Gimme what I'm asking for, I just want your sex
Gimme just a little more, girl I just want your sex
Baby it would mean a lot to me, don't talk back girl, gimme that sex, your body

[Bridge]
I pulled up in a SS on EE with my XX
Mad doggin', she tryna flex, it kinda work cause she fuck the best
Okay, I pulled up in a SS on EE with my next ex
She gives me those letters, we just have great sex
Her hair fucked, she got fucked
Her ass out, it got tucked, I want your body

[Chorus]
Gimme what I'm asking for, I just want your sex
Gimme what I'm asking for, I just want your sex
Gimme just a little more, girl I just want your sex
Baby it would mean a lot to me, don't talk back girl, gimme that sex, your body
I just want your sex
Gimme what I'm asking for, I just want your sex
Gimme just a little more, girl I just want your sex
Baby it would mean a lot to me, don't talk back girl, gimme that sex, your body
