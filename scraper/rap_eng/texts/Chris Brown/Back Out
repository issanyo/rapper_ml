[Intro]
In My Zone, Trendsetters sense, DJ Drama
Chris Breezy, Affiliates man let's go
What up baby, how you feeling?
Betcha I can make you feel better, listen up, take it off, listen

[Verse 1]
Came here on a mission with one thing on my mind, my mind, mind
Yeah I came here alone but I'm leaving here with a dime, shawty you're a dime, you're so fine
Girl you've got my full attention and there's something bout you
Girl the way you wind it up, makes me wanna get behind you, so won't you girl?

[Chorus]
Girl the club about to close come over here
Right now I'm heading to my car then to the crib
And baby we can leave pronto, going to my condo
You gon' black out when I throw your back out, out
I blow your back out, out
I blow your back out, out
I blow your back out, out
I blow your back out

[Verse 2]
I'mma make sure that you feel me, put your ankles where my ears be
And I'm all up on you, all up on you tryna put you to bed
I'mma do it in my boots, your stilettos, you can leave em on
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, give me a bone
Act like we making babies, sexing you so crazy, oh
Don't forget about fore
Play with me I promise I will make it go "ooh"
When I'm loving you it's like I'm swimming in a pool
You know what it is, girl give me a kiss
And I'm happy that you came, that's a double meaning
I'mma sleep, sleep, sleep
Your kitty's like a lullaby, I'm so glad that I'm in it

[Chorus]
Girl the club about to close come over here
Right now I'm heading to my car then to the crib
And baby we can leave pronto, going to my condo
You gon' black out when I throw your back out, out
I blow your back out, out
I blow your back out, out
I blow your back out, out
I blow your back out

[Bridge]
What's your name? What's your aim?
Hit me later on and maybe we can hang
You can call your girls, I'mma call my boys
I'm choosing them tonight and you're my choice, come on

[Chorus]
Girl the club about to close come over here
Right now I'm heading to my car then to the crib
And baby we can leave pronto, going to my condo
You gon' black out when I throw your back out, out
I blow your back out, out
I blow your back out, out
I blow your back out, out
I blow your back out

[Outro]
I just wanna get you all night
