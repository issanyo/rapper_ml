[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
It's a battle in this love war
Through the fire, I'm your dragon slayer
Yeah, oh I
It feels like I'm drowning in water
Needed more air all along
You don't remember all the love we shared
And you pretend not to care
Girl it tears me up
You've been fallin' in and out of love
All of your friends, they keep tellin' me I'm a hoe
I keep fuckin' up, it's really hard to trust me
Goin' crazy off that codeine in that cup, baby help me

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Fuck it, I already love her, already smokin' that killer
Fuck it, I already love her, so let me stop fuckin' with bitches
Fuck it, I already love her, I turn that girl to a lady
I put that girl in a Mercedes, 2016, the latest
Fuck it, I already love her
Oh, fuck it, I already love her
Fuck it, I already love her
Fuck it, I already love her

[Verse 2: Ray J]
It's a battle in this love war
Through the fire, I'm your dragon slayer, woah, I needed your help
Fuck it, I already love her, guess I'll stop fuckin' with bitches
And I won't be all undercover, oh you gon' see lots of pictures, oh yeah
Ever since I saw your photo, I've been doing a whole lotta drinkin'
Got fucked up off the coco, I did it until it was finished
Feel's like a dragon's burnin' in my soul
And I keep on battlin' with this devil on my shoulder

[Hook: Ray J & Chris Brown]
Fuck it, I already love her, already smokin' that killer
Fuck it, I already love her, I turn that girl to a woman
In that PG we fuckin' up
Put her in the mile high club, yeah
Fuck it, I already love her, already smokin' that killer
Fuck it, I already love her, so let me stop fuckin' with bitches
Fuck it, I already love her, I turn that girl to a lady
I put that girl in a Mercedes, 2016, the latest
Fuck it, I already love her
Oh, fuck it, I already love her
Fuck it, I already love her
Fuck it, I already love her
