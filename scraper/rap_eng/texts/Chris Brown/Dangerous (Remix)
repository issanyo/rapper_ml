[Intro: Trey Songz]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby this is getting serious
Dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous

[Verse 1: Sam Martin]
You, you take me down, spin me around
You got me running all the lights
Don't make a sound, talk to me now
Let me inside your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Martin]
I don't know what you're thinking sugar
But I just got that feeling sugar
And I can hear the sirens burning, red lights turning
I can't turn back now, so hold on tight

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious, oh oh oh, dangerous, oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Show me your soul, I gotta know
Bet that you're beautiful inside
Toes on the glass, car moving fast
Come take the wheel and drive

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't know what you're thinking sugar, oh yeah
And I just got that feeling sugar, oh yeah
I can hear the sirens burning, red lights turning
I can't turn back now, so hold on tight

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious, oh oh oh, dangerous, oh oh oh

[Bridge: Trey Songz & Chris Brown]
Trigga, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, baby, never scared, baby
Runnin' all the red lights, living on the edge, baby
Just a little crazy, maybe we are
Doing 'bout a hundred and she want it in the car
And I don't know what you did, don't know what it is
Can't explain enough, it's dangerous
It's dangerous, so dangerous, I wanna do it again
It's dangerous, so dangerous, I wanna do it again, it's dangerous, so dangerous

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious, oh oh oh, dangerous, oh oh oh

[Outro: Trey Songz]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous
