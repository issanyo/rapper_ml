[Verse 1]
Baby, does he do it for you?
When he's finished, does he step back and adore you?
I just gotta know, cause your time is money
And I won't let him waste it, oh no no
Baby, just go with it
Cause when you're with me, I can't explain it, it's just different
We can take it slow or act like you're my girl, let's skip the basics, woah oh

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so replaceable
You're worth the chase you're putting on

[Chorus]
It's alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable
A collectible, just like fine china

[Verse 2]
Favorite, you're my favorite
It's like all the girls around me don't have faces
And the saying goes
Life is just a game but I'm not playing, woah oh

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so replaceable
You're worth the chase you're putting on

[Chorus]
It's alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable
A collectible, just like fine china
It's alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable
A collectible, just like fine china

[Bridge]
Took me a while to find, your love
Ain't no amount of time, in this world
Save me a lot of time, and just love me
Feel it baby, feel it in your soul
Are you ready?
I know your heart been telling you, you belong to me

[Chorus]
It's alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable
A collectible, just like fine china
