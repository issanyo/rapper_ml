[Chorus]
Someone took my emotions
Don't forgive me, I didn't ask
Someone took my emotions
I feel good 'cause I don't feel bad

[Verse 1]
You say that you gon' take my heart, bae
But I don't believe in fairytales
It's the same old thing, not a damn thing changed
You playing games, playing games
Now I'm taking names, taking names now
And I don't play no more, baby, this is game over

[Pre-Chorus]
Broke your heart so you could feel it
Think we're done, I think we're really through
Me and you (Oh, yeah)
Tears fall down, feels like it's raining
Sorrow, I can feel the pain in you
All in you (Someone took)

[Chorus]
Someone took my emotions
Don't forgive me, I didn't ask
Someone took my emotions
I feel good 'cause I don't feel bad

[Verse 2]
I've tried to give you all my time, bae
But that never meant a thing to you (Oh, yeah)
So don't you call my name, all my info changed
It's such a shame, what a shame
Now I'm breaking chains, breaking chains up
And I don't play no more, baby, this is game over

[Pre-Chorus]
Broke your heart so you could feel it
Think we're done, I think we're really through
Me and you (This is)
Tears fall down, feels like it's raining
Sorrow, I can feel the pain in you
All in you (Someone took)

[Chorus]
Someone took my emotions
Don't forgive me, I didn't ask
Someone took my emotions
I feel good 'cause I don't feel bad

[Bridge]
All I ever wanted was your time
Right now, I don't even have the patience
I'm tired of waiting for you, I just wanna let go
You tryna change my mind but the answer's still no
Who are you?
You don't mean nothing, you ain't worth nothing
When I tell you something, you don't learn from it
I got my bags at the door, passport's a go
When I leave, you gon' come running
You did it, yeah, I got no feelings left
I'm so numb, you're so dumb
It's over, it's over

[Chorus]
Someone took my emotions
Someone took my emotions

[Outro]
Everything, everything I do
Ooh
Everything, everything I do
