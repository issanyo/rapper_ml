[Intro: Jordin Sparks]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (air)
Ooh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
If I should die before I wake
It's 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh
I'm here alone, didn't want to leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete
Wish there was a way that I can make you understand

[Pre-Chorus: Jordin Sparks]
But how do you expect me
To live alone with just me?
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air
No air, air, oh
No air, air, no, ooh
No air, air, oh, oh
No air, air

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Jordin Sparks]
I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
There's no gravity to hold me down for real
But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath but I survived
I don't know how but I don't even care

[Pre-Chorus: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
So how, how do you expect me, me
To live alone with just me? Oh, oh
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (oh, oh)
Can't live, can't breathe with no air (oh, oh)
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water, so deep (so deep)
Tell me how you gon' be without me, yeah
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe (breathe, no air)
It's no air, no air (no air)
No air, air, oh, no
No air, air, oh, no (no air)
No air, air, no more
No air, air

[Bridge: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
No more (no air)
Ooh, baby, oh (no, no air)
It's no air, no air (no air)
Hey, no, no air, no (no air)
Oh

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (no air)
Can't live, can't breathe with no air (no air)
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there (no breathing, no breathing at all)
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me, yeah
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe (I can't live without you, baby)
It's no air, no air
No air, air, oh (how do you expect me)
No air, air, no (me, yeah)
'Cause my world revolves around you, it's so hard for me to breathe (no, no, oh)
Hard for me to breathe
How, tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air (hard for me to breathe)
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there (no, no, no)
It's no air, no air (oh, not there)

[Outro: Jordan Sparks & Chris Brown]
Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air, oh
No air, air, no, oh
No air, air, no
No air, air, no air
No air
