[Intro: Ester Dean]
La da da, la da da, da
La da da, la da da, da

[Verse 1: Ester Dean]
We've been through the storm, we've been through it all
We had some close calls but never would fall
We climbed all the mountains, walked through all the valleys
But you never left me behind (oh, oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ester Dean]
I found my way through the clouds
No more running, scared, ain't closing my eyes, oh
I will be true this love from my heart
I'm laying my life on the line

[Chorus: Ester Dean & Chris Brown]
I (hey) will survive (hey)
As long as it's you by my side (hey)
I (hey) will survive (hey)
As long as it's you by my side
I'm stronger (stronger)
Stronger (stronger) stronger (stronger, stronger)
I'm stronger (stronger)
Stronger (stronger) stronger

[Verse 2: Ester Dean]
They said we wouldn't make it but guess what we made it
And we got them wondering how
You were always for me, never been the one to hurt me
You gave me peace of mine

[Pre-Chorus: Ester Dean]
I found my way through the clouds
No more running, scared, ain't closing my eyes, oh
I will be true this love from my heart
I'm laying my life on the line

[Chorus: Ester Dean & Chris Brown]
I (hey) will survive (hey)
As long as it's you by my side (hey)
I (hey) will survive (hey)
As long as it's you by my side
I'm stronger (stronger)
Stronger (stronger) stronger (stronger, stronger)
I'm stronger (stronger)
Stronger (stronger) stronger

[Bridge: Ester Dean]
Sometimes I can't believe that you are with me
There's nobody lucky as me
So I get on my knees to make sure that he
Knows that I'm grateful for what he gave me
Oh, oh, oh
I will survive

[Chorus: Ester Dean & Chris Brown]
I (hey) will survive (hey)
As long as it's you by my side (hey)
I (hey) will survive (hey)
As long as it's you by my side
I'm stronger (stronger)
Stronger (stronger) stronger (stronger, stronger)
I'm stronger (stronger)
Stronger (stronger) stronger
