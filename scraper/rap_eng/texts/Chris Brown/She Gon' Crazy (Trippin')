[Intro: R. Kelly]
Clap your hands, Clap
Clap your hands
Hit it

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Gave her something for the first time
Tore that ass off
Now she texting me all the time
Talking 'bout withdrawal?
Call my phone, ain't call her back
Now she blowing me up
And I can’t go nowhere
Without her showing up

[Chorus: Chris Brown & R. Kelly]
She trippin’
I stole her ass from a jumpin' nigga
Be pimpin'
But ever since I gave her the business
She gon', she gon', she gon'
She gon', she gon', she gon' crazy
Yeah, ooh, crazy, yeah, huh
Man this girl, she gon'
She gon', she gon', she gon'
She gon', she gon', she gon' crazy
Yeah, ooh, crazy, yeah, she trippin'

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ah, now you own me, now you own me
Trippin’ when we all alone, trippin’ when we lonely
Oh lordy, don’t you start it
Why you worried? It's just me and the homies, ah
Lot of money, arm, leg what the engine cost me, ah
Bo-Bob Marley, reefer in the club compartment
Lean, syrup coughin', I’m dead, nigga, coffin
This bitch crazy, no taxi, tryna charge me
Few hickeys, gotta lick it ‘fore you sticky
Fuck with me, pourin' double shots of the Henny
What's wrong with me? 50 one 50 but she pretty
I called the shots but you fouled business, bitch

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Tyga & R. Kelly]
She trippin’
Yeah, I stole her ass from a jumpin' nigga
Be pimpin'
Yeah but ever since I gave her the business
She gon', she gon', she gon'
She gon', she gon', she gon' crazy
Yeah, ooh, crazy, yeah, huh
Man, this girl, she gon'
Yeah, she gon', she gon', she gon'
She gon', she gon', she gon' crazy
Yeah, ooh, crazy, yeah, she trippin'

[Verse 3: R. Kelly & Chris Brown]
Pimps up, hoes down
Only got, one night in town
I don't catch feelings, I just break her down
Like a drive through, I'm In-N-Out
28's on my new shit, I keep it all white, that's a Kool Whip
Crib lookin' like a cruise ship
And your girl all in my cruise ship, hey
After party, my hotel
Got bitches all on my stairwell
Love a bad chick who don't kiss and tell
Say she love me, i'm like, oh well

[Chorus: Chris Brown & R. Kelly]
She gone, she gone, she gone (Yeahh)
She gone, she gone, she gone crazy
Yeah, ooh, crazy, yeah, huh (Damn, that girl she's gone)
Man this girl she gone
She gone, she gone, she gone
She gone, she gone, she gone crazy
Yeah, ooh, crazy, yeah, she trippin'
