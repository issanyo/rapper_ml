[Verse 1]
Girl, you know I got a problem with you, yeah
'Cause you ain't right, no, girl, you ain't fair, no
You don't even seem to know how you been messing with me, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
What am I supposed to do when all I wanna do is claim you?
What am I supposed to do when you be looking the way you do?
You don't recognise there's something about ya, little ma
You don't realise I wanna be with you, little shawty

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to keep my cool
When you be coming round, you be hanging out?
Tell me what do you expect for me to do?
Girl, you're so right it just ain't right, no
I forgot 'bout how you look in them jeans
The way you be walking and working them heels
Girl, you just don't know, I'm tryna be solo
But you're so right it just ain't right, no

[Verse 2]
Girl, you know you got me giving up on my homies
And I don't go out at night 'cause we do what I like
I don't even seem to care about nothing but you, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
What am I supposed to do, how am I supposed to go to back to being friends?
What am I supposed to do, how long do I gotta pretend?
You don't recognise there's something about ya, little ma
You don't realise I wanna be with you, little shawty

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to keep my cool
When you be coming round, you be hanging out?
Tell me what do you expect for me to do?
Girl, you're so right it just ain't right, no
I forgot 'bout how you look in them jeans
The way you be walking and working them heels
Girl, you just don't know, I'm tryna be solo
But you're so right it just ain't right, no
