[Verse 1]
See the days are gone and I've been losing my mind
I'm crashing, I'm running out of time
Now the way that I perceive things, hoping you don't deceive me
But it's just the feeling inside that I
Had to find a way to find out, this relationship is about
Seems like you want to count me out
Mmm mmm, but you were the one who changed
Thought it would stay the same but it still remains

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm a believer, the pain and the loss
Baby girl, I won't either, even though you might say both of us need a breather
Thought I had it all, had to take that fall
Baby, to let you know that
I'm a believer, the reason that you should stay is to be that I need ya
The way I look at you as if I'm an achiever
We could love again
I wanna be your friend, we can win, I'm a believer

[Verse 2]
Baby girl, sit it down come around and take it straight up
Don't need to end my life, girl
I want you around there's no need to frown
Girl, give your love to me
I want ya, I need you
Every night and day, hoping that we stay together
But can I hold you in my arms?
Thought I was playing, I'm saying, baby girl

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm a believer, the pain and the loss
Baby girl, I won't either, even though you might say both of us need a breather
Thought I had it all, had to take that fall
Baby, to let you know
I'm a believer, the reason that you should stay is to be that I need ya
The way I look at you as if I'm an achiever
We could love again
I wanna be your friend, we can win

[Bridge]
Can you stop blaming me for it, just this once?
Can you commit to my love?
My heart's breaking down
Girl, you know that I will never leave your side, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm a believer, the pain and the loss
Baby girl, I won't either, even though you might say, need a breather
Thought I had it all, had to take that fall
Baby, to let you know
I'm a believer, the reason that you should stay is to be that I need ya
The way I look at you as if I'm an achiever
We could love again
I wanna be your friend, we can win

[Outro]
I'm a believer, I'm a believer
I'm a believer, I'm a believer
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'm a believer in you, girl
