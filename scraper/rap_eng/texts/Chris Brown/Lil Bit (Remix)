[Chorus: K Camp]
Ayy, get fucked up, drink a little bit (ayy)
Smoke a little bit, pop a little bit (ayy, oh)
Ayy, get fucked up, drink a little bit (ayy)
Smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, ayy, get fucked up (ayy)
We ain't doin' much tryna have a good time
Got four bad bitches, man, the pleasures all mine (yeah)
Girls kissin' girls, best believe they all fine
Gir-girls kissin' girls, best believe they all fine
Leggo, leggo, ha, leggo, leggo, ha, what you doin'? (Whoop whoop, turn up)
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, ayy, get fucked up (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit (ayy, ayy, hey)
Ayy, get fucked up

[Verse 1: K Camp]
Four bad bitches, man, the pleasure all mine
We ain't doin' nothin', tryna to have a good time
Roll around the city, Porsche seats on recline (skrrt)
Four bad bitches fuckin' at the same time (woah!)
Bitch named Keisha got a ass like a bubble
Feed her M&M's, watch her turn into some trouble (oh)
Two hands on the ball, shawty just doubled (woo!)
Once I get mine I ain't even tryna cuddle (smoke)
All in the party, hippy trippy on the Henny
Jar full of weed, baby girl, I got plenty
Break fast for the chick like I work at Denny's
Shawty, where the shots? I need many, many, many  (woah!)
Molly in the system, drinkin' out the bottle (drank)
Shawty, goin' in, goin' hard full throttle (haha)
Instagram likes got her feelin' like a model (yeah)
If you lookin' for the drugs, don't worry I got 'em

[Chorus: K Camp]
Ayy, get fucked up, drink a little bit (ayy)
Smoke a little bit, pop a little bit (ayy, oh)
Ayy, get fucked up, drink a little bit (ayy)
Smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, ayy, get fucked up (ayy, woah!)
We ain't doin' much tryna have a good time
Got four bad bitches, man, the pleasures all mine (yeah)
Girls kissin' girls, best believe they all fine
Gir-girls kissin' girls, best believe they all fine
Leggo, leggo, ha, leggo, leggo, ha, what you doin'? (Whoop whoop, turn up)
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, ayy, get fucked up (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit (ayy, ayy, hey)
Ayy, get fucked up

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
(Uh-huh, ha)
Two bad bitches and they fuckin' with a nigga (yeah)
Feelin' on her booty, dick harder than a missile (wow)
Ass in a circle, let me feel it just a little
Don't be pullin' on my belt 'cause that shit holdin' up the pistol (bang)
She like to drink that tequila (tequila)
Hennessy for all my niggas (for my niggas)
You can't take none of my bitches (no, oh)
You fuck round, you gon' meet my killers (yikes!)
Ooh, iced out Rollie bright when the light hit (hit)
No Janet Jackson, don't fuck with no penny's (woo)
Blood in yo T-shirt, them bloods rollin' with me (truth)
If you bust at me first, I shoot up the city (do, do, do, do, do)
Hunnids on top of hunnids on them titties (yeah)
Nigga, you ain't never seen no money like this
Codeine, I pour it up
Poppin' them pills, got me throwin' up, fuck yeah

[Chorus: K Camp & Chris Brown]
Ayy, get fucked up, drink a little bit (ayy)
Smoke a little bit, pop a little bit (ayy, oh)
Ayy, get fucked up, drink a little bit (ayy)
Smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, ayy, get fucked up (ayy, woah!)
We ain't doin' much tryna have a good time
Got four bad bitches, man, the pleasures all mine (yeah)
Girls kissin' girls, best believe they all fine
Gir-girls kissin' girls, best believe they all fine
Leggo, leggo, ha, leggo, leggo, ha, what you doin'? (Whoop whoop, turn up)
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, ayy, get fucked up (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit (ayy, ayy, hey)
Ayy, get fucked up
