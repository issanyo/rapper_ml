[Intro]
I guess they know I'm bad (bad)
I got a problem

[Verse 1]
Shopaholic's  what they call 'em
My addiction, my prescription
Gimme shoes and give me bags
How much you want?
I need 'em bad

[Pre-Chorus]
All them girls be checking my bags
While they be biting my swag
I guess they know I'm bad (Bad)

[Chorus]
What a bad little girl I am (I got a problem) (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am (I need you to solve it) (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
Bad bad bad bad bad bad
What a bad little girl I am (I got a problem) (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am (I need you to solve it) (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
Bad bad bad bad bad bad

[Vese 2]
Don't need no bargain, need no sale
I want the best, I dress me well
Love Cavalli dipped in Versace
Chic ain't cheap and everybody knows

[Pre-Chorus]
All them girls be checking my bags
While they be bitin' my swag
I guess they know I'm bad (Bad)

[Chorus]
What a bad little girl I am (I got a problem) (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am (I need you to solve it) (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
Bad bad bad bad bad bad
What a bad little girl I am (I got a problem) (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am (I need you to solve it) (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
Bad bad bad bad bad bad
What a bad little girl I am (I got a problem) (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am (I need you to solve it) (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
Bad bad bad bad bad bad
