[Intro: Chris Brown]
David, David, David, David Banner (Banner)
David Banner (Banner)
Ladies love me
I'm on my Cool J

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
My bad, I'm sorry
I'm double-parked, ya that's my Bugatti
And that's my Ferrari next to my Ducatti
Call my old school "Big Bertha", that big body
Boy I get exotic, my car need a pilot
Get free drinks at parties
Your nigga needs his wallet
No limit to what I'm spendin
So I know she's 'bout 'bout it
And who in the hell is smoking in here?
Cause it's super cloudy!
Goons with me, dressed like skaters
Give you bruised kidneys, stretcher later
Man my house is so big
Take the escalator to the elevators
The elevator to the private jet
Then I jet, nigga, see you later

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J (yellow model chick)
Ladies love me (yellow bottle sipping)
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J (yellow Lamborghini)
Ladies love me (yellow top missing)

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
(Shawty Mane, I'm back)
Baby I'm your doctor
I could be your rocker
Swagging, I'm not bragging
But I swear that I could rock you
Baby I'm not crazy
I got swag like Patrick Swayze
You know the haters never phase me
That's not how my mama raised me
I am incredible, this is inedible
Killing this track was inevitable
I am hetero, baby you better know
JB is generally a TT
Just look at me now, I said look at me!
Swagging with a Krook3d T
Body slam the beat from D.B
Call me Booker T, I said whoa there!
Whoa there, baby you just need to stop
I'm busy, out performing
And I'm going to the top, I've got so much to lose
So I'm steady getting guap, while them haters go down
And we just get too watch, amazing, I'm blazing
Look, over here, she said I'm amazing
Nobody's facing what I'm facing
Set a pace so I can race without pacing
Lace my shoes up, start racing
You can taste it, without fasteing
I mean fasting, start blasting
Call up Lauryn Hill to "Doo Wop That Thing"
Swagger jacking is not what I do
JB is the man, yeah he's the truth
He's a beast when he steps up in the booth
He just landed.. I did too
I'm a gentleman, yes I'm a gentleman
Out of my element but I'm still elegant
I'm full of adrenaline, you know what that means
Louis V high tops with the skinny jeans

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J (yellow model chick)
Ladies love me (yellow bottle sipping)
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J (yellow Lamborghini)
Ladies love me (yellow top missing)
