[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Niggas wanna bang in the squad, don't wanna put the work in
Say you want my money, scared of fame, better murder then
See the chopper, bullets too big, you can see the doctor surgery
Mask, can't identify the burglars
But we know you givin' up the confidential information
Say you got the cheese, you a rat, that's a perfect fit
Niggas wanna hate on a slick money makin' mitch
Love takin' pussy niggas hoes and give 'em the D
OHB, it ain't nothin' for me to buy a bitch
Real paper, I ain't never gotta lie to bitches
Even niggas with them killers know my ma religious
All my bitches lickin' pussy with good intentions
Roll the dice, yeah, 3, they my fuckin' triplets
I ain't fuckin' with them lame hoes that look suspicious
But I'm fuckin' with the main hoe that look delicious
Nigga, they get sticky sticky, give that bitch the business

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Rollin' up the bud, yeah that bitch a dub
Yeah, we know the plug, smokin' all the drugs, 'bout to buy the club
Killin' all the pussy, nigga, get your bodies up
All this ice up on my body, we the Mighty Ducks
Who got the bud? Who givin' it up?
Got them shooters in the cut, say the word, we fuck the party up
Throw that money up, yeah, that bitch a dub
Fuckin' with the plug, goin' up, we gon' fuck the party up

[Verse 2: Young Blacc]
I'm turnt up and they know that, poked up like Funk Flex
45 in that 12 back and I'm posted up in that 4 hat
See this nigga, this gold rap, kill a nigga then go rap
Talkin' 'bout that Draco, one phone call, that's a snatch
Give it to a nigga if you really want it
Bitch coppin' and appeals, hit me in the mornin'
Ha, a nigga lyin' 'bout theyself
I'm talkin' 'bout niggas who killin', dyin' by theyself
You say we from the same hood, where I see you at?
And I ain't never seen movin' in a hoover hat
Ha, switchin' sides, you confused 'cause I'm famous
We all OG nigga, tell me what his name is
Get your weight up lil nigga, I'm pushin' 4 place
It's still puttin' big drugs on the interstate
No name, that's knock out, pea brains wanna Glock out
Niggas need to pass the light niggas, this my house

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Rollin' up the bud, yeah that bitch a dub
Yeah, we know the plug, smokin' all the drugs, 'bout to buy the club
Killin' all the pussy, nigga, get your bodies up
All this ice up on my body, we the Mighty Ducks
Who got the bud? Who givin' it up?
Got them shooters in the cut, say the word, we fuck the party up
Throw that money up, yeah, that bitch a dub
Fuckin' with the plug, goin' up, we gon' fuck the party up

[Verse 3: Young Lo]
Yeah, my whole team supreme, grew up in the crack 80's
Still got the plug on it, get your 4 in the baby
Out the mud, bustin' drugs with my nigga Hoody Baby
Drop the ice in the pot, now it's back to back Mercedes
See I'm all about the check, still reppin' Tex
Still rep the sex, mile high, smoke Luigi on the jet
50 in these Balmains, this a young'n from the lanes
Yeah, I'm geeked up, mixin' up the mollys with the Xans
And I'm stingy with the Act, keep the red from my bitches
We gon' pop a half a Perc, I'm on that, even on a Skittle
And the tongue gon' work, play that pussy like a fiddle
Bet you I can make you squirt, have your face all in the pillow

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Rollin' up the bud, yeah that bitch a dub
Yeah, we know the plug, smokin' all the drugs, 'bout to buy the club
Killin' all the pussy, nigga, get your bodies up
All this ice up on my body, we the Mighty Ducks
Who got the bud? Who givin' it up?
Got them shooters in the cut, say the word, we fuck the party up
Throw that money up, yeah, that bitch a dub
Fuckin' with the plug, goin' up, we gon' fuck the party up
