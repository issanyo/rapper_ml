[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
I don't like the way he’s looking at you
I'm starting to think you want him too
Am I crazy? Have I lost ya
Even though I know you love me
Can’t help it

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face, you
Can call me obsessed
It’s not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That’s why (that’s why)
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful
And everybody wants your sex
That’s why (that’s why)
I still get jealous

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I wish you didn't have to break my heart
I wish you saved a little bit for me (for me)
'Cause, baby girl, I learned my lesson, yeah
And girl, I love you, there I said it

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas & Chris Brown]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face, you (right now)
Can call me obsessed
It’s not your fault that they hover (hover)
I mean no disrespect (oh, babe)
It's my right to be hellish (ooh)
I still get jealous

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Chris Brown]
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That’s why (that’s why)
I still get jealous (yeah)
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful (yeah)
And everybody wants your sex
That’s why (that’s why)
I still get jealous

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Chris Brown]
We're the only ones invited
There is no one else for you
'Cause you know I get excited, yeah
When you get jealous too

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas & Chris Brown]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest (yeah, yeah)
I'm getting red in the face, you
Can call me obsessed
It’s not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous (yeah)

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Chris Brown]
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful (oh, babe)
And everybody wants a taste
That’s why (that’s why, oh I)
I still get jealous (I get jealous)
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful (beautiful, yeah)
And everybody wants your sex (everybody wants your sex)
That’s why (that’s why)
I still get jealous

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Oh, that's why
I still get jealous
Oh, that's why
I still get jealous
