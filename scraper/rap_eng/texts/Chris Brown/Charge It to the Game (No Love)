[Intro: Aaliyah]
I can't believe you're telling me these things, boy

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
If you ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood
If you ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood, no love

[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
Cause if he's fast, home boy you'll never last
Somebody who's talkin' right, can't come with just all night
Boy you don't know me, try and you'll see
So what you telling me, won't spend my day on me

[Pre-Chorus: Static Major & Aaliyah]
And I don't know if we gon' ever change
Ask the next man, he'll probably say the same
I can't believe you're telling me these things, boy
Don't hate me, just charge it to the game

[Chorus: Aaliyah & Chris Brown]
You ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood
If you ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
When I'm around her, you know you get
Say she loves me, she loves me, you did
I do you right, that's why you get
When you leave who you think she staying with?
Okay, now baby, b-baby
I know you really wanna, know you really wanna leave
You can be my girl
I know you wanna, I know you really wanna be, baby
Girl, you don't know me
Try and you'll see
'Cause what you telling me
I think you're ready

[Pre-Chorus: Aaliyah & Chris Brown]
I can't believe you're telling me these things, boy
Girl, I won't be phased, you think I'm gonna last
Girl, what I'm talking about, baby, you're on my mind
Girl, you don't know me

[Chorus: Aaliyah & Chris Brown]
You ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood
If you ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood

[Outro: Chris Brown & Aaliyah]
When I'm around her, you know you get, no love
Say she loves me, she loves me you get, no love
I do you right, that's what you get, no love
When you leave, who you think she staying with?
