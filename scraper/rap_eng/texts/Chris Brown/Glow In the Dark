[Verse 1]
Been thinking bout this all damn day and I can't wait to see your face
My hands are dying to touch ya but I ain't got the patience to wait
And I think it's time that I lose control, lose control
And in my mind I'm sexual, sexual

[Chorus]
Girl are you ready? Are you ready for love? (ready, ready)
Girl are you ready? Are you ready for us? (ready, ready)
Girl are you ready? Are you ready for love? (ready, ready)
Girl are you ready? To glow in the dark (ready, ready)

[Verse 2]
It's okay to scream, and if you need to, take a second to breathe
Hey, there it is, I can feel your legs trembling, you feel the sweat dripping from my chest
And then you like, "Oh oh oh baby don't stop"
Then I'll be like "No I won't, I'ma take ya to the top"

[Chorus]
Girl are you ready? Are you ready for love? (ready, ready)
Girl are you ready? Are you ready for us? (ready, ready)
Girl are you ready? Are you ready for love? (ready, ready)
Girl are you ready? To glow in the dark (ready, ready)

Girl are you ready? Are you ready for love? (ready, ready)
Girl are you ready? Are you ready for us? (ready, ready)
Girl are you ready? Are you ready for love? (ready, ready)
Girl are you ready? To glow in the dark (ready, ready)
