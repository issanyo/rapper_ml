[Verse 1]
Hands against the wall
Still girl you've never fell this far
Feel the heat on my skin
Haven't seen the sun ever since

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter how, no matter when
I can't get close enough, can't get close enough
Reach for the clouds, nothing to spare
Flying like the both of us, the both of us yeah
Whatever we go through, it always leads back to you

[Chorus]
Where the heartbeat is marching
The fire mutes the darkness
Home is where the heart is
So home is where she is, she is
Home is where the heart is
So home is where she is

[Verse 2]
Hands against the wall
Still girl you've never fell this far
Feel the heat on my skin
Haven't seen the sun ever since

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter how, no matter when
I can't get close enough, can't get close enough
Reach for the clouds, nothing to spare
Flying like the both of us, the both of us yeah
Whatever we go through, it always leads back to you

[Chorus]
Where the heartbeat is marching
The fire mutes the darkness
Home is where the heart is
So home is where she is, she is
Home is where the heart is
So home is where she is

[Bridge]
Wouldn't trade this for any other place in the whole world
Wouldn't trade this for any other place in the whole world

[Chorus]
Where the heartbeat is marching
The fire mutes the darkness
Home is where the heart is
So home is where she is
