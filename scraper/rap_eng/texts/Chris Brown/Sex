[Verse 1]
Shawty come here
I wanna grab your body, lay you on the sofa
And as I pull your hair
I'm gonna stroke your body make you bend over for me
And you've been waiting patiently for me to break you off
And girl your clothes still on, but I'ma rip 'em off
With my teeth
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And girl I'ma whisper this into your ear
How deep do you want me to go?
Do you want me to speed it up, speed it up or go slow?
Start from the bed then we out here on the floor
Girl you're really in for a treat now, but don't fall in love cause

[Chorus]
We just having sex
I'm gonna get you wet
We not making love tonight
Hickies all over your neck
Kissing all over your body, babe
Girl you gon' get it tonight
When we have sex, sex, sex
When we have sex, sex, sex
When we have sex, sex, sex
When we have sex, sex, sex
When we have sex

[Verse 2]
Looking at my baby
Sleeping like a baby
Body so amazing, drive me crazy
I'm about to wake you up
Girl I wanna sex you up
I know how to go about this
Cause I gotta do something
Kissing and the touching
Ain't no rushing
When it comes to sexing
Slow and easy does it
You gon' think you dreaming about me licking you
Girl you can thank me in the morning
When you wake up feeling hella good
Feeling like you want me
I didn't realize how much I made you scream, yeah

[Chorus]
We just having sex
I'm gonna get you wet
We not making love tonight
Hickies all over your neck
Kissing all over your body, babe
Girl you gon' get it tonight
When we have sex, sex, sex
When we have sex, sex, sex
When we have sex, sex, sex
When we have sex, sex, sex
When we have sex

[Bridge]
It's gon' be the best
Best you ever had
I can promise that, baby
I lay you on your back
Then between your legs
I can make 'em spread, baby

[Chorus]
We just having sex
I'm gonna get you wet
We not making love tonight
Hickies all over your neck
Kissing all over your body, babe
Girl you gon' get it tonight
When we have sex, sex, sex
When we have sex, sex, sex
When we have sex, sex, sex
When we have sex, sex, sex
When we have sex
