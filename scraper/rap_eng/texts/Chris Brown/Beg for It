[Verse 1]
Girl, I woke up before the light, thinking about tonight
I can't, I can't sleep
Just a few hours ago, we had the TV on
Drowning out your screams
Tell me your favorite love song girl
I'm gonna play it while your toes curl
Girl, what you saying? Speak your mind
Tell me what you like

[Chorus]
I'mma make you beg for it, beg for it
I'll give you what you need, only if you say please
I'mma make you beg for it, beg for it
Gon' and whisper your wishes to me, babe

[Verse 2]
Not gonna lie to you, wasn't expecting you to
Have me on my knees, yeah
I'mma gonna make you cry, tears from your paradise
And love your ass to sleep, yeah
You've got my favorite Secrets on
And I won't use my hands to take them off
Girl what you saying? Speak your mind
Tell me what you like

[Chorus]
I'mma make you beg for it, beg for it
I'll give you what you need, only if you say please
I'mma make you beg for it, beg for it
Gon' and whisper your wishes to me, babe

[Bridge]
Baby I'm gon' let it go, girl, you gon' get it good
I'mma make twenty more seconds feel like twenty more minutes
Baby I'mma make you scream, yeah, I'm not finished yet
Twenty more seconds, oh, you ain't gotta beg no more
I'mma give it up, I'mma give you all my love
And baby I
I'm gon' give you what you asking for
But if you want more

[Chorus]
I'mma make you beg for it, beg for it
I'll give you what you need, only if you say please
I'mma make you beg for it, beg for it
Gon' and whisper your wishes to me, babe
I'mma make you beg for it, beg for it
I'll give you what you need, only if you say please
I'mma make you beg for it, beg for it
Gon' and whisper your wishes to me, babe
