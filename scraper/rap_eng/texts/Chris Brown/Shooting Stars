[Verse 1]
You wanna see love, it's invisible like the air
You still feel it and you can tell that it's there
So here's your chance to feel more than alive
We are not coming down, let's be one with the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
Raging waters and abandoned fields
We fly high like a rocket ship
All the raining makes you cry

[Chorus]
But I know that there is no more for me
Spread your wings and hold on to me
Won't come down, we shooting through the stars
Just like shooting stars
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
Faster than the speed of sound
How we love one another
I'm starting to figure out
That we can stand any weather

[Pre-Chorus]
Raging waters and abandoned fields
We fly high like a rocket ship
All the raining makes you cry

[Chorus]
But I know that there is no more for me
Spread your wings and hold on to me
Won't come down, we shooting through the stars
Just like shooting stars
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
