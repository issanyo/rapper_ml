[Verse 1]
Hey girl
We should take this up to my room, oh
Cause I wanna lay you down
And do some dirty things to you, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
In between the sheets, you and me, girl, I'm a freak
I'mma keep it up, guaranteed to go all night
Your legs wrapped around, 'round my head
On my shoulder, you can teach me girl, it's alright

[Chorus]
All it takes is one drink, one touch
One kiss to open you up
Girl, your body turns me on right now, on right now
On right now, you know I got the key to your heart
Your heart, the key to your heart
Your heart, the key to your heart
Your heart, the key to your heart
You know I got the key to your heart

[Verse 2]
Hey girl
Why don't you slip into that sexy lingerie I like? Oh yeah
I wanna play girl
So baby, show me all the games you like, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
In between the sheets, you and me, girl, I'm a freak
I'mma keep it up, guaranteed to go all night
Your legs wrapped around, 'round my head
On my shoulder, you can teach me girl, it's alright

[Chorus]
All it takes is one drink, one touch
One kiss to open you up
Girl, your body turns me on right now, on right now
On right now, you know I got the key to your heart
Your heart, the key to your heart
Your heart, the key to your heart
Your heart, the key to your heart
You know I got the key to your heart

[Bridge]
I'mma open two more bottles, baby, let me know if you want more
Tell her we don't need more ice cause baby girl, you cold
You making me come out of my clothes, I just want to make you so oh and baby, we can get right to it
We can skip the foreplay, I can't wait to see you ride and I'll be the lover of your life

[Chorus]
All it takes is one drink, one touch
One kiss to open you up
Girl, your body turns me on right now, on right now
On right now, you know I got the key to your heart
Your heart, the key to your heart
Your heart, the key to your heart
Your heart, the key to your heart
You know I got the key to your heart
