[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Just go 'head and do the right thing, do the right thing
Do the right thing, oh, just go 'head and do the right thing
Do the right thing, and girl, if you won't get naughty
I don't need a key I just push buttons, start it

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, girl, you a pro
Oh yeah, oh yeah, on the, on the floor
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, girl, you got my heart
Oh yeah, oh yeah, do it, do it, do it, do it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, girl, you a pro
Oh yeah, oh yeah, on the on the floor
Oh yeah, oh , yeah, girl, you got my heart
Do it, do it, do it, do it

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Look, now a nigga spend a hundred thousand on bottles, baby girl, where you goin'?
Ugly girls be quiet, all them models screamin', perform it
Two bad ones with me, it's three somethin' in the mornin', get it?
Jump humpin' 'til the mornin', I get it, her mouth open she yawnin', get it?
I been on her all day, but if she come way I'ma put on my shades
Still givin' me face but all your girlfriends hatin' 'cause you M.I.A
But you over my place, I'm the king in my city you can have your way
I'm the camera man, set the camera up, put your booty up, then we can press replay

[Pre-Hook: Chris Brown]
Your friends can't tell me nothing
Leaving with me, I know you want me (Know you want it)
It's in your eyes, don't tell me lies
Don't need no disguise, lemme give it to you like oh yeah

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, girl, you a pro
Oh yeah, oh yeah, on the, on the floor
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, girl, you got my heart
Oh yeah, oh yeah, do it, do it, do it, do it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, girl, you a pro
Oh yeah, oh yeah, on the on the floor
Oh yeah, oh , yeah, girl, you got my heart
Do it, do it, do it, do it

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Me, you, and her, when I leave, I swerve
Let me see that kitty purr, 2 Chainz, that's a pair
Then I put her in the air, might have to take her to the ER
Make the bed go, "Ee-rr", up and down like a seesaw
Who saw? Who saw? Got jazz like Utah
Tackle her like football, your baby daddy's a Ru Paul
Big dog, who don't? I do the shit that you don't
Livin' life in the fast lane so I bought me a two-door

[Pre-Hook: Chris Brown]
Your friends can't tell me nothing (They can't tell)
Leaving with me, I know you want me (Ooh)
It's in your eyes, don't tell me lies
Don't need no disguise, lemme give it to you like oh whoa

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, girl, you a pro
Oh yeah, oh yeah, on the, on the floor
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, girl, you got my heart
Oh yeah, oh yeah, do it, do it, do it, do it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, girl, you a pro
Oh yeah, oh yeah, on the on the floor
Oh yeah, oh , yeah, girl, you got my heart
Do it, do it, do it, do it

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Do the right thing, act a fool, be yourself, gon' girl
Aw yeah, real player, like that-that, like that-that there
Champagne campaign, oh man, turn up the flame
Burn up the frame, hop in my game, what's my name? What's my name?
Ooh-ee, Snoopy, give it to ya like, "C'est la vie"
Life of the party, rockin' your body, blowin' big, bag it up, Bob Marley
Ladies and gents, players and pimps, this is the shit, one hundred percent
So you can just shake it and make it and dip it and wop it and pop it and drop it and bend
I left the scene crispy clean, CBDBGZ, we see she see
RiRi, Kiki, Mimi, Bebe, all of 'em love me
Wasn't my fault, left your girl with seasonin' salt
D-O-double G, he's the boss, these and 'em all, life in song, aw

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Just go 'head and do the right thing, do the right thing
Do the right thing, oh, just go 'head and do the right thing
Do the right thing, and girl, if you won't get naughty
I don't need a key I just push buttons, start it

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, girl, you a pro
Oh yeah, oh yeah, on the, on the floor
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, girl, you got my heart
Oh yeah, oh yeah, do it, do it, do it, do it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, girl, you a pro
Oh yeah, oh yeah, on the on the floor
Oh yeah, oh , yeah, girl, you got my heart
Do it, do it, do it, do it
