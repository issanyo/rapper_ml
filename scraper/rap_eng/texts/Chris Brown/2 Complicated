[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Shattered glasses and cigarettes
There's a lot built up inside of me
And I have so many regrets
This isn't how things used to be
And you're never satisfied
Guess what? I'll stop fucking trying
You suck
In case you didn't know, you're horrible

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
But it's always true, I'm always wrong, anything I do
And I always go to war with you and I lose, yeah, yeah
I'm a silly dude 'cause I keep coming back to you
This is feeling like deja vu, my head's spinning around and you got me saying

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're way too complicated
I can no longer take it
We're no good, let's just face it
'Cause you're way too complicated

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You're such a snobby girl, used to think you were a queen
Damn, sure did rain on my parade
Same old silly games you play, this is such a waste of time
Starting to think that you're insane, cukoo cukoo

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
But it's always true, I'm always wrong anything I do
And I always go to war with you and I lose, yeah, yeah
I'm a silly dude 'cause I keep coming back to you
This is feeling like deja vu, my head's spinning around and you got me saying

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're way too complicated
I can no longer take it
We're no good, let's just face it
'Cause you're way too complicated

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
I'm not sure, what else can I do? I've had enough of your rules
Yeah, you, way too Soduku, true
Ain't in no mood for proofs and square roots
Go ahead, run and find yourself another man who would figure you out
Figure you wild, I'm sick of your mouth
'Bout to slip, don't have to listen and rather sleep on the couch
Yeah, stick to my decision, chick, I'm kickin' you out
No mathematician, take the digits and bounce, you got me screamin' out

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're way too complicated
I can no longer take it
We're no good, let's just face it
'Cause you're way too complicated
You're way too complicated
I can no longer take it
We're no good, let's just face it
'Cause you're way too complicated
