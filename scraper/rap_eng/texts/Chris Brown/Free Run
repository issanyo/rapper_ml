[Verse 1]
Broken again I'm, down on my knees ripped apart
But I see you out there, so I'm taking these chains off my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm listening close for you, feeling my way out the dark
I'm on my way to you and won't nothing keep me from you

[Chorus]
So I’ll just free run, 'til my feet start to lift off the ground
I will just free run, 'til I’ll find myself right where you are, oh
Whoa, whoa, I’ll free run to ya
Whoa, whoa, free run to ya

[Verse 2]
Life with you leaving, is like being locked upside down
I'm all out of reasons, to let all this hurt keep me bound

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ll listen close for ya, I don’t wanna miss the good parts
I'm on my way to ya and won't nothing keep me from ya

[Chorus]
So I’ll just free run, 'til my feet start to lift off the ground
I will just free run, 'til I’ll find myself right where you are, oh
Whoa, whoa, cause I’ll free run to ya
Whoa, whoa, I'll free run to ya

[Bridge]
Uh huh, woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah, free run

[Chorus]
Free run, 'til my feet start to lift off the ground
Free run, and 'til I’ll find myself right by your side, I gotta keep free running
Free run, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Free run, oh, woah, yeah
