[Verse 1]
If I could take a trip to outer space, she would be the one, I will see when I get to Heaven's gate
She would welcome me with her arms, open wide
And a smile will shadow me brighter than the sun
She hasn't had a fair chance, so I'll give her one, let me tell you who she is, yeah

[Chorus]
She's a fallen angel, sent from heaven up above
She's a fallen angel, waiting for me to love her, yeah
Know that she's, she's a fallen angel, take your judgment off her
I know, that she's a fallen angel

[Verse 2]
You know, maybe I should help her mend, her broken wings so she can fly again
But I don't wanna lose everything that I've gained, turning me a selfish man, oh
Cause without 'em my heart just don't go, no more, no more
I couldn't take the pain, from watching her fly away, so say that you'll stay, she's mine

[Chorus]
She's a fallen angel, ooh sent from heaven up above
She's a fallen angel, waiting for me to love her, yeah
Know that she's, she's a fallen angel, so take your judgment off her
I know, that she's a fallen angel

[Bridge]
Don't you, baby don't you worry, I'm gon' help you fly
Just take me under your wing and we can reach the sky
Baby don't you worry, I'm gon' help you fly
Lil mama, don't you worry, you gon' reach the sky, she's a

[Chorus]
She's a fallen angel, hey hey, sent from heaven up above just for me
She's a fallen angel, waiting for me to wrap my arms around her
Know that she's, she's a fallen angel, so can do without the judgement, oh
I know, that she's a fallen angel

[Outro]
Baby I know, I know that they done hurt you
But I'm here to take it all away
So if you let me, you know what, just put your heart in my hands
And everything they said, I take it back like this
You don't mean nothing, I don't want ya
I don't need ya, never loved ya
You're nobody, and'll never make it
You're a mistake, oh
