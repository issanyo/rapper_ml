[Intro]
Oh, baby, ooh
Ooh, baby

[Verse 1]
Candlelight, get the mood right
Oh, baby, pick out your favorite wine, let go, no need to hide
I'm ready to tear it up
So baby, let me inside and just look me in my eyes, oh woah, oh woah
Girl, I don't give a damn, ain't no other man taking my place
He can't hit your spot like I can, making your legs shake, oh
Licking your lips, girl, I love the way you taste
Yeah, you know I love that kinky shit
I'm all over your body
I'm tryna lay you on your stomach on that freaky shit
Be submissive let me dive in
Yeah, she think I'm freaking on her, I'ma rub it in
Ooh baby, I'ma fuck it up
I see the moon, loving 'til the sun come up
It's too good, I'm trying not to bust a nut
Too fast, I'm tryna last

[Chorus]
I can't even lie, lie, lie
It's too damn good, I can't handle it, babe
But I'ma try to last all night
Ooh woah, I'ma try to last all night
It's alright, I hope I can last all night
I can't even lie, lie, lie, ooh
I can't even lie, lie, lie
I hope I can last all night

[Verse 2]
Yeah, if you knew right, you would do right
And just make love to me, only me
Don't give my love away, girl
It ain't for everybody 'cause you're mine
Baby, don't even get me started, that pussy mine, ooh Lordy, Lordy
Your hands in my pockets, huh, she know I’ma give her anything she ever wanted
Skrrt, skrrt, she driving, key in her ignition, here’s the real difference between bitches and women
Ooh, baby, know I love that, how you take that, how you throw it back
Baby, you know just what you’re doing, I ain’t stupid, yeah

[Chorus]
I’ma try my best to last all night
Ooh woah, I'ma try to last all night
It's alright, I hope I can last all night
I can't even lie, lie, lie, ooh
I can't even lie, lie, lie
I hope I can last all night, huh
