[Intro]
If I want—, if I want—, if I—, if I want—
If I want—, if I—, if I want—, if I—, if I want—
If I want—, me ready for
If I want—, if I want—, if I—, if I want—
If I want—, if I—, if I want—, if I—, if I want—
If I want—, me ready for

[Verse 1]
I’m a carnivore, natural born killer
So I gotta be on any and everything in front of me (Ah)
In the club 'cause I’m gonna eat tonight (Yeah)
I’m a gorilla, like drums on my chest so I gotta beat
And when I start to do you know what it means
You can’t leave, not until you battle me

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you’re out there, somewhere (Somewhere)
I feel you and I smell your fear (Your fear)
Bust a few shots in the air
Come on, yeah, come on
Your body is 'bout to go off (Go off)
I want you to show off (Oh)
You're classified, top secret (Secret)
You're a weapon

[Chorus]
So it's bombs away, bombs away (Buck! Buck!)
Calling for you now
So you better take cover (You better)
'Cause I need it and I want ya
I think you calling on me 'cause I’m ready for war (Buck! Buck!)
Ooh girl, I like that
And yeah, you coming with it but I need a little more
'Cause I’m firing right back

[Verse 2]
It’s getting hot and heavy
She looking like she want me to cut her like a machete
And I’ma give it to her but that’s only if you let me
I’ma let her touch it, but it’s only the beginning, yup
She n-n-n-nasty but I ain’t mad at all
And she b-b-b-bad like she running from the law
By the way she dancing on me, that’s how I can tell
She a GI Jane in the bed for real

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you’re out there, somewhere
I feel you and I smell your fear (Your fear)
Bust a few shots in the air
Yeah, come on, yeah, come on (Oh)
Your body is 'bout to go off (Go off)
I want you to show off (Show off)
You're classified, top secret (Secret)
You're a weapon

[Chorus]
So it's bombs away, bombs away (Buck! Buck!)
Calling for you now
So you better take cover (Yeah, you better)
'Cause I need it and I want ya
I think you calling on me 'cause I’m ready for war (Buck! Buck!)
Ooh girl, I like that
And yeah, you coming with it but I need a little more
'Cause I’m firing right back (Haha)

[Verse 3]
Okay, it’s like I travel to another dimension
'Cause shawty got my soldier standin' at attention
I’m like, yeah, it’s the battle of the sexes
I wrap her legs 'round my head like a necklace
Uh, it’s like it’s bombs over Baghdad
And shawty ass fat so I’ma bag that
M-M-Mercy, is what you beggin' for
I’m standin' on the bar screamin'—
So hold your glasses up if you need more
Whole lot of women but I need more
I got that long sword, like the Marine Corps
Now let me take a stab at it, leave your spleen sore
I think I’m King Kong, Godzilla
Go a couple rounds, Thrilla in Manilla
Now show me who iller and I’ll show you a mirror
You want that fire, I deliver

[Chorus]
Bombs away, bombs away (Buck! Buck!)
Calling for you now
So you better take cover (You better)
'Cause I need it and I want ya
I think you calling on me 'cause I’m ready for war (Buck! Buck!)
Ooh girl, I like that
And yeah, you coming with it but I need a little more
'Cause I’m firing right back (Haha)
