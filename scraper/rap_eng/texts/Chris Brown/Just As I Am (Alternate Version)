[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Love, you gotta feel me when I say
Nothing else matters, I wanna please you everyday

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
And when you're not with me you're in my heart
No matter the distance, I'm never too far from where you are
I promise you that I can, I can
Only thing you desire in a man
I'll do whatever I can
Give you the world in your hand
Come to me as you are

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Accept me just as I am
So no one would have to change for nobody
From the ground that I stand
I'll give you all that I can
With everything that I am
I promise you that I can
I promise you that I can

[Verse 2: Prince Royce]
Love, you're like an angel out of heaven sent to me
All of the light you bringing, shining into me
I'm your energy

[Pre-Chorus: Prince Royce]
I promise you that I can, I can
Only thing you desire in a man
I'll do whatever I can
Give you the world in your hand
Come to me as you are

[Chorus: Prince Royce]
Accept me just as I am
'Cause no one should have to change for nobody
From the ground that I stand
I'll give you all that I can
With everything that I am
I promise you that I can
Never wanna see you leave
Wanna be the air you breath
[?]
You're the one that I adore
Always say I love you more, baby

[Bridge: Prince Royce & Chris Brown]
I want you, girl
No puedo vivir mi vida (girl)
Estoy solo sin ti
TÃº eres mi vida
Your love is all I need

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Prince Royce]
I promise you that I can, I can
Only thing you desire in a man
I'll do whatever I can
Give you the world in your hand
Come to me as you are

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Prince Royce]
Accept me just as I am
So no one would have to change for nobody
From the ground that I stand
I'll give you all that I can
With everything that I am
I promise you that I can
I promise you that I can
