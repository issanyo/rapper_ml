Now the word around town, 'round town that boy goin' crazy (goin' crazy)
It's been a while since I been out, then come back to whip that Mercedes (that Mercedes)
And my wrist keep drippin', grain grippin', I'm doin' 180 (doin' 180)
Now I used to be pimpin', be pimpin' but how can I say this? (But how can I say this?)

I really hope that you know what's up
I ain't playin', oh no (ain't playin'), I ain't playin', no woah (playin')

[Pre-Chorus]
When my mind's fucked up, I just don't care at all
I just hope you pick up when it's two or three (pick up, two or three)

But I would go deep in that ocean like Flipper, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 3]
She got the keys to my house and my heart, I hope that she save me (that she save me)
And she know I'm gon' lay the pipe, pipe down, I turn that bitch crazy
Why you trippin'? You won't even listen 'cause you used to all the niggas
I promise I'm different, different
And I hope you take off your clothes, know I'm persistent, I know that that ass is soft
You got to go, don't care 'bout them sheets, girl, let's come take them covers off
When we making love, girl, I just might take the rubber off
And if you fuck them niggas and cheat on your nigga, then what you gon' do to me?
Girl, I hope you, huh
Girl, don't listen to them bitches, oh
Girl, don't tell your business, don't tell your business
And girl, just tell me the truth, I'm fucking with you, haha
