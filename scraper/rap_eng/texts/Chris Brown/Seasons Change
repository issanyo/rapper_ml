[Verse 1]
Been a month or two, 8 weeks for me exactly
Since we sat and talk for hours
Girl it's just ain't right, when you give me the run around
I can't even give you flowers

[Pre-Chorus]
It's all in your head when your friends talk about me
You run away from the truth and accept the lies, you doubt me
I'm like a fool contemplating, I'm just waiting on your call
We couldn't last 'til the Winter and now it's Fall, we fell in love, I'm still falling

[Chorus]
Sometimes I let my thoughts run away from me
Don't know how many days in a year
Running round, running round 'til  I catch up, oh yeah
Now how the hell I let you get away from me? Yeah
Never thought that I would say goodbye to my girl, no
Girl you changed like the seasons

[Verse 2]
Girl I've given my time and all my love
Not to mentioned I didn't cheat but you didn't even trust me
Even when you out late night, messages on your phone babe
I never said a word, I just left it alone

[Pre-Chorus]
It's all in your head when your friends talk about me
You run away from the truth and accept the lies, you doubt me
I'm like a fool contemplating, I'm just waiting on your call
We couldn't last 'til the Winter and now it's Fall, we fell in love, I'm still falling

[Chorus]
Sometimes I let my thoughts run away from me
Don't know how many days in a year
Running round, running round 'til  I catch up, oh yeah
Now how the hell I let you get away from me? Yeah
Never thought that I would say goodbye to my girl, no
Girl you changed like the seasons

[Bridge]
No, I'll never the see the brighter side
Cause you're everything that I wanted and I don't wanna see you go
I don't wanna spend the rest the of my life without you
Here with me, I'll never let go, I need you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I let my thoughts run away from me
Don't know how many days in a year
Running round, running round 'til  I catch up, oh yeah
Now how the hell I let you get away from me? Yeah
Never thought that I would say goodbye to my girl, no
Girl you changed like the seasons
