[Verse 1]
Ye' would've said you're so "Amazing"
So how could you be so "Heartless" girl?
"Live Your Life", take T-I-M-E
"Day 'n' Night" just like KiD CuDi, you'll think of me, you will, oh
Drake would say that you're the "Best He Ever Had"
Rumors come and go but you keep in shadow
Everywhere you go it follows, can't understand, I still love you
Watch the blogs talk about this one

[Chorus]
Soon as I thought I found the right woman
There were other guys who thought the same thing about her
Like damn you let me down, down, down
Cause you're famous girl for breaking hearts
You're famous girl, girl, girl
You're famous girl, girl, girl
You're famous girl, girl, girl
Should've known you'd break my heart, that you would break my heart, heart, heart

[Verse 2]
Keri would've said my love "Knocks Her Down"
Keyshia would've told me I was "Sent From Heaven"
Sorry B I don't wear no "Halo", you were first to play the game though
Sorry I bust the windows out your car
I might have cheated in the beginning
I was wrong for writing "Disturbia"
But I meant it in "Forever", we were 'posed to be together
And I can't let you go

[Chorus]
Soon as you thought you found the right man
There were other girls who thought the same thing about me
Like damn I let you down, down, down
Yes I'm famous girl for breaking hearts
I'm famous girl, girl, girl
I'm famous girl, girl, girl
I'm famous girl, girl, girl
Didn't know I'd break your heart, that I would break your heart, heart, heart
I'm famous girl, girl, girl
I'm famous girl, girl, girl
I'm famous girl, girl, girl
Didn't know I'd break your heart, that I would break your heart, heart, heart

[Bridge]
Many hearts we should've left unbroken
Empty words are better left unspoken
Too much pressure, I wish time was frozen
Seems we lost our way now, I hope you're happy being famous girl

[Chorus]
You're famous girl, girl, girl, should've known that you would break my heart
You're famous girl, girl, girl yeah, should have known you would leave me lonely
You're famous girl, girl, girl yeah, should've known you'd break my heart
That you would break my heart, heart, heart
But then again I'm famous girl, I'm famous girl, girl, girl
I've broken my share of hearts, I'm famous girl, girl, girl
I'm famous girl, girl, girl, should've known from the start that we would break apart
Didn't know I'd break your heart, yeah, that I would break your heart, heart, heart
