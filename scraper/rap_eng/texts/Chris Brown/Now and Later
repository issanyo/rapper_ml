[Verse 1]
It's like I'm at a candy buffet
Gum drops, blow pops, strawberries and grapes
I know you got the flavor
You all in the mix like a cup of Kool Aid
When I try to kiss ya, put the suger on my lips
I can't resist, I'm not used to this
Can anybody help me why?
Shawty got me feeling high

[Chorus]
You're my now and later, girl
Since you're so good to me
Like a cherry flavor life saver
Please don't ever leave
Now and later, girl
My candy girl
I can see getting close to you
Baby, I want you all to myself

[Verse 2]
They don't understand
I consider as my first real love
I know you're authentic, first sho'nuff
From the rough into love
Baby, you changed me, I feel good about you
Before the sugar rush, I'd never doubt ya
I need you dealing with me, not without me
So baby, get in close to me

[Chorus]
You're my now and later, girl
Since you're so good to me
Like a cherry flavor life saver
Please don't ever leave
Now and later, girl
My candy girl
I can see getting close to you
Baby, I want you all to myself

[Bridge]
You don't have to worry, baby, we got forever
To keep it grown, baby, it's a good thing
You're right here and I am always cool with that
Candy coated love
Put your hands up if you in the spot
Let me see your now and later drop
Put your hands down playing around
Now let me see your now and later drop
Put your hands up if you in the spot
Let me see your now and later drop
Put your hands down if you wanna play around
I know you wanna see your now and later drop

[Chorus]
You're my now and later, girl
Since you're so good to me
Like a cherry flavor life saver
Please don't ever leave
Now and later, girl
My candy girl
I can see getting close to you
Baby, I want you all to myself
Baby, I want you all to myself
Baby, I want you all to myself
Baby, I want you all to myself
Baby, I want you all to myself
