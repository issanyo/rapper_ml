[Intro: Chris Brown & Tank]
Said oh, I just wanna celebrate with you, girl
It's the remix, remix, CB, kick it off

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Your panties on the floor right next to me, got you screaming, "Nigga damn"
Hang that sign up on the door that say "Privacy" 'cause you gon' get it, girl
Bend your back now, girl, I'ma set the camera up, blow your back out
Rewind the tape and play it back now, girl, so just celebrate, ladies, right now (hey)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Said oh, I'm gonna give it, you gonna get it
Said oh, remember when I did it, yeah, oh
Said oh, I'm gonna give it, you gonna get it (break you down)
Said oh, remember when I did it (work you out)

[Verse 2: Tank]
We got that bottle of that Rosé, bab,y we gon' celebrate
Make you feel like it's your birthday, baby, we go celebrate
Private after party, I can't wait to celebrate
All up on your bod, baby, we go celebrate
It's like the fourth of July in between your thighs
It's like fireworks just light up sky
Don't need no invitation
You're my reservation to this love making, it's a celebration

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Ooh, celebrate you, just 'cause you special I'll show you when I undress you, girl
Ooh, it's a celebration, oh girl, let's celebrate
Pulled up in a drop top, you hopped your sexy ass in
Girl, I'm telling you once this party starts, it never ends
Buckle up, girl, you know how that Maserati spins
Just wanna touch you in places my hands have never been
Yes boo, so true, my lips too, they were made to kiss you
Make you say I miss you, just 'cause of the way that I lick you
Fresh up off the road on a worldwide tour
You can celebrate now, baby, I'm yours
I'ma treat you to a Trey day, baby, we can celebrate
You can have it your way, baby, we can celebrate
Girl, I want your body, baby, we can celebrate
Private slumber party, it's like oh oh oh oh oh oh, ooh
It's like oh oh oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4: Tank]
Girl, I kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, celebrate so hard I'll make you feel it
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, this the remix so you know I had to go in
Body's like my favorite holiday (oh)
Like the eve of something big and I can hardly wait (oh)
Like it's only once a year I always mark the day (oh)
When the cheering gone I'm feining for another day, celebrate
Girl, are you ready for your gift? (Gift)
Wrapped in something big, I know that I can make it fit (fit, fit, fit)
With the candy 'cause you know I really love to lick (lick)
And all the cake you can fit into your outfit, it's crazy, oh
Lemme pop that thang like a bottle of Rosé, oh
Hop up on this mic like it's your birthday
I'ma work your door 'cause you're V.I.P
Baby, celebrate with me
We can start off with some foreplay, baby, we can celebrate
Section lighting in the doorway, that's how we gon' celebrate
Private after party, I can't wait to celebrate all up in your body
And I must be your celebrate
It's like the fourth of July in between your thighs
It's like fireworks just light up the sky
Don't need no reservation
You're my invitation to this love making, it's a celebration

[Outro: Tank]
Get your bottles in the air, oh, woah
Get your passes in the air, oh, woah
Hands up in the air, oh
Celebrate
