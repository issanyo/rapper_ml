[Verse 1]
I'll take you to the promised land (yeah, uh-huh)
Elevate your mind, body and your soul, girl (soul)
To the promised land (uh-huh)
Elevate your mind, body and your soul, girl (woo)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain’t no other feeling better than you here, girl (aw yeah)
I swear, I’m up late night scrolling through your pictures
Wanna know, wanna know if I’m still on your mind (baby, do I cross your mind?)
Going to your favorite places hoping I'd run into you, I can’t lie

[Chorus]
It's the same shit, just a different day
I keep thinking ‘bout you, oh
Same shit, just a different girl
But ain't nothing like you, oh (oh, woo)
Do you love me? Oh baby, do you?
Do you love me? Me, me, what about me?

[Verse 2]
I dedicate, dedicate this to you (oh)
For every word, I ever said to you (oh)
All you ever wanted was a shoulder
You can hold on, oh yeah, oh yeah, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't no other feeling better than you here, girl (you here, girl)
Got a nigga fucked up when I'm scrolling through your pictures
Wondering if I’m still on your mind

Same shit, just a different day
I keep thinking ‘bout you (‘bout you)
Same shit, just a different girl
But ain't nothing like you, oh (oh)
Do you love me? love me? (Yeah)
Do you love me? Do you love? Me, me, what about me?

[Verse 3]
I dedicate, dedicate this to you
For every word, I ever said to you
All you ever wanted was a shoulder
You can hold on, oh yeah, oh yeah, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't no other feeling better than you here, girl (you here, girl)
Got a nigga fucked up when I'm scrolling through your pictures
Wondering if I’m still on your mind
Tryna have this conversation with the love of my life but it's the

[Bridge]
Same shit, it's the same shit, girl, you know it is
Don't be acting stuck up, you gotta let it go
Give a damn ‘bout your pride
I’ve been feining ‘bout you
My nightmares, I’m dreaming ‘bout you
I might have to see the doctor
‘Cause I can’t make it 'til tomorrow

[Chorus]
Same shit, just a different day
I keep thinking ‘bout you
Same shit, just a different, girl
But, ain't nothing like you (oh)
Do you love me? Love me
Do you love me? Me, me, what a hoe

Same shit, just a different day
I keep thinking ‘bout you
Same shit, just a different girl
But, ain't nothing like you (oh, oh)
Do you love me?
Do you love me? Me
