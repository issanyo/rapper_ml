[Verse 1]
I don't wanna go there
We should never go there
Damn, why you wanna go there?
I guess I gotta go there

[Pre-Chorus]
You're hearing rumours about me and you can't stomach the thought
Of someone touching my body when you're so close to my heart
I won't deny what they saying because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you, so please babe

[Chorus]
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me then let it be beautiful
Let it be beautiful, let it be beautiful
Let it be beautiful, let it be beautiful

[Verse 2]
Everything I say right now, is gonna be used in another fight
And I've been through this so many times, can we change the subject?
You gonna start asking me questions like "Was she attractive? Was she an actress?"
Baby the fact is

[Pre-Chorus]
You're hearing rumours about me and saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry, making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy, saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset? Damn, you're beautiful, so baby

[Chorus]
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me then let it be beautiful

[Bridge]
Just let the past, just be the past
And focused on things that are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am and not who I was
I'll promise I'll be, the one that you can trust

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me then let it be beautiful
Let it be beautiful, let it be beautiful, let it be
Let it be beautiful, ay, let it be beautiful, yeah yeah yeah

[Outro: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
I don't wanna go there
We should never go there
