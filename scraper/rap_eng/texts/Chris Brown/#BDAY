[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tank]
Girl, it's your birthday in here tonight (birthday in here tonight)
Girl, it's your birthday in here tonight (birthday in here tonight)
Give it to me, go

[Verse 1: Siya]
Go, go, go, shawty it's your bday
You and your girls takin' shots like a relay
I know y'all only come around when the bottles out
Shit, I only come around when the models out
So-so-so what's your sign, baby?
You a Cancer or Gemini, baby?
You a freak, do you do it for the Vine, baby?
I'm just tryna figure out if we can vibe, baby

[Verse 2: Tank]
(R&B money)
I don't wanna waste no time
I just wanna help you celebrate
'Cause I don't meet 'em like you every day
Blow them candles out and get down to the cake
I don't wanna waste no time
Baby girl, I know this what you like
Get it in the air, we can take flight
It's a special dance, only right, girl

[Pre-Chorus: Tank]
Ooh, woah, since you walked through the doors, it's been like
Ooh, woah, lemme show you what it's for 'cause I'll
Give you all I got and won't look back
What I do today, you gon' remember that

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tank]
Girl, it's your birthday in here tonight (birthday in here tonight)
Girl, it's your birthday in here tonight (birthday in here tonight)
Give it to me, go babe, go babe, go babe (go babe, go babe, go babe)
Can you get low babe, low babe, low babe? (Low babe, low babe, low babe)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I see you sittin' with your man, but you're over there starin' at me
I'm already makin' plans, baby, I know what your tip gon' be
You know I'm the truth, huh, I do all the things you wanna do, huh
We should let you loose huh, strip you down to your birthday suit huh

[Pre-Hook: Tank & Chris Brown]
Since you walked through the doors, it's been like
Lemme show you what it's for 'cause I'll
Give you all I got and won't look back, I won't look back

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Tank]
Ooh, woah, since you walked through the doors, it's been like
Ooh, woah, lemme show you what it's for 'cause I'll

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tank]
Girl, it's your birthday in here tonight (birthday in here tonight)

[Verse 4: Sage the Gemini]
Yeah, yeah, uh, I feel like your man know your future (hey)
He know that if he leave you alone, I'ma seduce ya
Walk around talking 'bout karma is a bitch
But if I ever say Karma, I'ma end it with the Sutra (ooh wee)
Happy birthday, yeah we gon' get along (check)
Here's a bag of nothin', gon' put it on
What about your ex? You ain't finna check your phone
She respond like, "Who?" I'm like shit, Mike Jones
All the models out, spent a check and bring the bottles out
Pass 'em out, what shot you want? Count it out
Wildin' out like Nick Cannon in NY (ooh)
And we gon' get right 'cause

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tank]
Girl, it's your birthday in here tonight (birthday in here tonight)
