Baby, don't fall in love, don't you fall for me

[Verse 2]
R.I.P. to me
Swear that pussy got me weak
She shaking her knees
Locking her legs, I can hardly breathe
She make her money at A.O.D
But she fuckin' on me for free
And she can buy her own red bottoms
But I don't really care 'bout that

[Chorus]
Baby, don't fall in love, don't you fall for me (so, baby, don't you, huh)
You might be what I want, but you're not what I need (oh, yeah, yeah)

Drippin' like water (oh yeah. yeah)
Yeah, she get wet for me (ooh, for me, yeah)
I swear that pussy be the death of me, yeah

[Bridge]
Girl, you know I love to lick it, lick it
And you like it when I lick it, lick it, oh yeah
Girl, it's hard to fight your feelings
And I can't lie, you know I love it
Come on, baby, that's a big mistake to shake your ass
You know I can't control my dick when you start moving that
I close my eyes but I can still feel that ass
On my body

[Chorus]
Baby, don't fall in love, don't you fall for me (don't you fall, baby)
You might be what I want, but you're not what I need (want, ooh)
Baby, don't fall in love, don't you fall for me (don't you fall, baby, woo)
You might be what I want, but you're not what I need, oh yeah (yeah)

Drippin' like water (yeah)
Yeah, she get wet for me (for me, yeah)
I swear that pussy be the death of me, yeah (ooh)
Pussy get wet like water
But I don't call her
Pussy get wet like water
But I don't call her
Pussy get wet like water
Drippin' like water
Yeah, she get wet for me
I swear the pussy be the death of me, yeah
