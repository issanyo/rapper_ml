[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
It don't get no better than my tongue writing you letters
Feeling you get wetter, we'll be making love until the morning after
And I can feel your tide slowly rising as I'm sipping from your water fountain
We gon' flood the bed, take it to the ground, while I'm in your ocean baby, hold my head down

[Chorus: Chris Brown & R. Kelly]
I wanna drown in it, drown in it, yeah, baby
Drown in it, drown in it, just take me under
I wanna drown in it, drown in it, under your waters, girl
Drown in it, drown in it
I won't ever come up, oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
High heels and your red lips, it's Fahrenheit in here
And I can see a million ways for me to surfboard between your waves
Girl we be going up down, all around, drip drop, don't stop, no umbrella, playing in your rain
Shawty, I'll be splashing in your deep end, hydrate me, oh baby, come sit that right on my face

[Chorus: Chris Brown & R. Kelly]
I wanna drown in it, drown in it
Drown in it, drown in it, oh just take me under girl
I wanna drown in it, drown in it, under your waters, girl
Drown in it, drown in it
I won't ever come up, oh

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, baby, baby, yeah I wanna drown in it
Baby, baby, baby, yeah, I wanna drown in it
Take me under, babe, yeah, I wanna drown in it
Yeah, I just wanna tell you

[Verse 3: R. Kelly & Chris Brown]
No price can pass what itâ€™s worth, babe
Your pool is like heaven on Earth, baby
You screaming while I'm touching your spot
Oh girl, I got your water so hot
And I wanna drown in it, I wanna drown in it, babe
I wanna drown in it, baby
All you gotta do is keep filling me up with your juices
Keep it right there baby, don't lose it

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Chris Brown]
I wanna drown in it, drown in it, yeah, baby
Drown in it, drown in it, girl, just take me under
I wanna drown in it, drown in it, under your waters, girl
Drown in it, drown in it, swim in your deep, babe
I wanna drown in it, drown in it, all up in your creek, baby
Drown in it, drown in it, and I'm not coming up
I wanna drown in it, drown in it, gonna stay right there, baby
Drown in it, drown in it, gonna live in there, baby
I wanna drown in it, drown in it, right there under your water baby
Drown in it, drown in it, just like a male mermaid, babe
I wanna drown in it, drown in it, baby, baby, baby, baby
Drown in it, drown in it, baby, baby, baby, baby
I won't ever come up, oh

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Yeah, yeah, I stay thirsty, babe, yeah
