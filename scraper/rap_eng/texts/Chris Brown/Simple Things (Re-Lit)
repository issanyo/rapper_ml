[Verse 1: Miguel]
She said, I don't want a model
I don't want a movie star
You don't have to win the lotto, oh
I want you to win my heart, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
She said I just want someone true
She said I just want someone to

[Chorus: Miguel & Chris Brown]
Smoke with me, babe, and lay with me, babe
And laugh with me, babe, I just want the simple things
To smoke with me, babe and laugh with me, baby
And lay with me, babe 'cause I just want the simple things
And I just want you, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want you, oh (I just want you)
Yeah, oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I said, I don't need a model
Baby, I don't need a debutante
Just be a tough act to follow
You know, a free spirit, with a wild heart

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Alright, I said I just want someone real and someone true
I need you to smoke with me, baby

[Chorus: Miguel & Chris Brown]
Smoke with me, baby, lay with me, baby (your body)
Laugh with me, baby, I just want the simple things (ooh)
Smoke with me, baby, lay with me, baby (smoke, lay with me, baby)
Laugh with me, baby, I just want the simple things (oh)

[Verse 3: Future]
(Yeah, hahaha, uh, yeah)
I just wanna keep my Tom Fords on while I get some head
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, oh
Ooh, I take your spirit like the grim reaper, ooh
Hold you so close I feel your heart beatin', woo
Damn size with that juice, juice, we conversate and do jitsu
Pass off that loud to you, you gon' roll it up with no issue
It's why this can't be keepin' one thou' (one thou')
Just knowin' you gon' be there when the mile down there with me (yeah)
New Range Rover Autobiography
You can let your girl get in front, I play the back seat (play the back)
Relaxin' your mind, that's my intuition (I got that)
Once our chemistry combine, love is revolution (uh)
I cherish every moment, I'm a better man
I get to dancin' with the devil, hope you understand
I be floatin' 'round with the sauce bag on me (on me)
I hope you hold me down 'til I fade away

[Bridge: Miguel & Future]
I just want you
(Fade away, fade away, fade away
Hold me down 'til I fade away)
Look at me, baby, I just want you
You, I want you, baby
You, alright, I just want you
You

[Chorus: Miguel & Chris Brown]
Smoke with me, baby, lay with me, baby (lay with me, baby)
And laugh with me, baby, I just want the simple things (laugh with me, baby, oh)
Smoke with me, baby, lay with me, baby, now (oh no, baby)
Laugh with me, baby 'cause I just want the simple things (oh no, I just)

[Outro: Miguel]
I just want you, I just want you
Give me all of you
All of you, darling, oh, I want you
I want you, I just want the simple things
