[Intro: Chris Brown]
Same time, same, same
Woo, kissing at the same, woo
Same time, two bitches at the same time

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Red bottom bitch (hey)
Baby poppin' shit (ooh, ooh)
They know that I'm rich
I'm tryna fuck the clique (hey)
Girl, don't play no games
You know just what you came to
Heard they with this shit (go, go, go, go)
So fuck it, let me bring my main through

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She don't play no games, no she don't BS (no, no, she don't)
Ain't gotta be my main, said she coming with her friends (no, no, she don't)
Said they both gon' drop it, ooh yeah, on the chandelier
This what happen when a nigga keep it real
I told them both the truth, yeah, pull up at the same time
I'ma need both of you, pull up at the same time
Ain't no rules, I need two (I need two)
Double trouble, tongue kissing at the same time
Yeah, she love, love, love, love it (ooh)
Kissing at the same time
Yeah, she love, love, love, love it
Yeah, this a double date night
Yeah, she love, love, love, love it, yeah (ooh)
Kissing at the same time
The same time, two bitches at the same time

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
I can't do just uno, I need least a duo (hey, hey)
Tell your friend to bring two friends
And tell her bring 'bout two more
I'ma beat the shit up like judo (woah)
I'ma dog with the pussy like Cujo (woah)
She said she do squats and yoga
Got that ass on sumo
I'm on a pill right now, wanna see you slide across her face
That's how I feel right now, kiss it and tell me how it taste
Let's keep it trill right now
I'm tryna fuck 'cause I called up her
I need a plus, one ain't enough, woo

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She don't play no games, no she don't BS (no, no, she don't)
Ain't gotta be my main, said she coming with her friends (no, no, she don't)
Said they both gon' drop it, ooh yeah, on the chandelier
This what happen when a nigga keep it real
I told them both the truth, yeah, pull up at the same time
I'ma need both of you, pull up at the same time
Ain't no rules, I need two (I need two)
Double trouble, tongue kissing at the same time
Yeah, she love, love, love, love it (ooh)
Kissing at the same time
Yeah, she love, love, love, love it
Yeah, this a double date night
Yeah, she love, love, love, love it, yeah (ooh)
Kissing at the same time
The same time, two bitches at the same time

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Ring, ring, she calling me, you know I pick up
Baby, got two phones, that's the hotline, yeah
Said she with her friends and her friends down to play too
Uber on the way, about 9

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She don't play no games, no she don't BS (no, no, she don't)
Ain't gotta be my main, said she coming with her friends (no, no, she don't)
Said they both gon' drop it, ooh yeah, on the chandelier
This what happen when a nigga keep it real
I told them both the truth, yeah, pull up at the same time

Ain't no rules, I need two (I need two)
Double trouble, tongue kissing at the same time
