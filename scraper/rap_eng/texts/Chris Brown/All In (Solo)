[Intro]
All in, all in, all in

[Verse 1]
I just hit the block rolling
I just got lit up, feeling little too loud, yeah
My pockets full of weed and Trojans, oh
Just might take over, get the mood right (mood right)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah
She's leaving with somebody she don't know (oh no)
Tryna get lit and let it go
Got so many bottles, she want some more
And you know what I'm on, girl

[Chorus]
So shawty, tell me what you're drinking on
All this light, I know it's stinking, oh
Got these Benjamin Franklins, yeah
Just throw it up, and watch it fall on someone
Going all in, all in, all in, all in (going all in, ayy)
Dancing all night
Going all in, all in, all in, all in (going all in)

[Verse 2]
I got a million chains on
Said that we should take an Uber
My momma told me not to bang on her, bang on her
And she be colder than a cooler, oh yeah, yeah, woah
Hey hey, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah
She's leaving with somebody she don't know (oh no)
Tryna get lit and let it go
Got so many bottles, she want some more
But you know what I'm on, baby girl

[Chorus]
So shawty, tell me what you're drinking on, oh
All this light, I know it's stinking, oh (oh yeah)
Got these Benjamin Franklins, yeah (throw it up)
Just throw it up, and watch it fall on someone
Going all in, all in, all in, all in (we be going all in)
Dancing all night
Going all in, all in, all in, all in  (we be going all in)

[Bridge]
Sip some, sip some, twist some, twist some
Sip some, sip some, twist some, twist some

[Chorus]
So shawty, tell me what you're drinking on, oh

Got these Benjamin Franklins, yeah (throw it up)
Just throw it up, and watch it fall on someone
Going all in, all in, all in, all in (we be going all in)
