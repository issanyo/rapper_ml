[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
You can call me when it's over
Or you can call me when you not sober
'Cause you know I don't care about him
I think you better without him
Your friends say that he the one that you can't count on
But I'm the one you thinking 'bout putting a house on
After putting your mouth on, call, you be getting the dial tone
But only 'cause I'm putting your word strong
I got you so gone, your friends hate you now
And biting ass bitches wanna take your style
Everybody judging what you beat the trial
Like get deep up in it like a root canal
Every time we stepping out, we making a statement
You ain't gotta worry 'bout him, I won't say shit
Yeah, you know I hate waiting
But I stay patient, so

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Call me when it's over
'Cause I know what to do, to do to treat you right
So call me when it's over
I'll be sure to make it worth your while this time
Da, da, da, da, da, do, do, da
Huh!
Da, da, da, da, da, do, do, da
Ow!
Da, da, da, da, da, do, do, da
Huh!
Call me when it's over
Call me when it's over

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
I know you tired dealing with the same shit
I'm on the road to riches, you should probably make a lane switch
You can leave the drama that you came with
And I can get whatever if you name it
Count a million cash, can you blog that?
He ain't fall in line, he should fall back
We can do whatever if you call back
New crib, new whips and all that
There's something 'bout the way you move
That make me wanna get back to school but still act a fool
I make you smile when you out the Coupe
I'm a real one, I like 'em with an attitude
And I wanted your name before I had a clue
Know you got a little man, I ain't mad at you
I know breaking up is hard to do
So all I really ask is

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Call me when it's over
'Cause I know what to do, to do to treat you right
So call me when it's over (call me)
I'll be sure to make it worth your while this time (make it worth your while this time, yeah, yeah)
Da, da, da, da, da, do, do, da
Huh!
Da, da, da, da, da, do, do, da
Do, do, do, do, do, da, ow!
Da, da, da, da, da, do, do, da
Huh! Girl, just call me
Call me when it's over
Just call me when it's over
Call me when it's over (Maybach Music)

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Call me, baby, when your love get low (yeah)
Call me whenever you need some more (just call me)
Call me, baby, when you want that gold
Give it to you nice and slow
Call me, you don't have to be alone
Diamonds should be the reason you get cold
What's mine is yours
So call me when it's over
Call me, baby, when your love get low
Call me whenever you need some more (oh, oh)
Call me, baby, when you want that gold
Give it to you nice and slow (call me)
Call me, you don't have to be alone (oh, no, no)
Diamonds should be the reason you get cold
What's mine is yours
So

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Call me when it's over
'Cause I know what to do, to do to treat you right
So call me when it's over (call me when it's over)
I'll be sure to make it worth your while this time
Da, da, da, da, da, do, do, da
Huh!
Da, da, da, da, da, do, do, da
Ow!
Da, da, da, da, da, do, do, da
Huh! Huh! Ow!
Call me when it's over
Call me when it's over
