[Intro]
R-R-Rad

[Verse 1]
Wish I could swallow up this feeling
So far, the ground won’t touch my feet
And I know, your lips and mine should never meet

[Pre-Chorus]
Some thing you say, got stuck in my head
You shoot the stars, then we broke the bed
Spring turn to summer, thats when you went
But I reckon that you think of me, woo

[Chorus]
When you go-o-o-o (I go when you-)
When you go-o-o-o (I go when you-)
When you go-o-o-o (lonely nights, when I ain’t with you)
I reckon that you think of me, ow

[Verse 2]
I tried to live outside the moment, hey
But the feel of your touch, it touches me
And I know, your lips and mine should never meet
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Some thing you say, got stuck in my head (ooh, ooh, my head)
You shoot the stars, then we broke the bed (stars, the bed)
Spring turn to summer, thats when you went
But I reckon that you wait of me

[Chorus]
When you go-o-o-o (You gon’ be stressing)
When you go-o-o-o (all in my head)
When you go-o-o-o
I reckon that you think of me

[Bridge]
When you go, go, go
Girl you go, go, go
When you go, when you go
Where you go, go, go?
I reckon that, reckon that
Where you go? Where you go?
I recognise you wanna be there

[Chorus]
When you go-o-o-o
When you go-o-o-o
When you go-o-o-o, woah, woah, woah yeah
I reckon that you think of me

[Outro]
When you go
When you go
When you go, ooh
When you go
We go, we go oh woah
