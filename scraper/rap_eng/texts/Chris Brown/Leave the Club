[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'mma make you fall in love, when you leave the club
All I really want you to do is scream my name
And nobody else, just love me girl cause you bad
All by yourself, just love me, girl

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Who is she? She got a special type of perfume
And her bag's Balenciaga, it's full of tricks, look at her move
Damn, I feel guilty cause I ain't offer her no seat in VIP yet
Girl, I know you want a drink, just dance for me, you not gonna regret
Cause I ain't got ones, all I got is hundreds
Girl, you look so amazing when you do it
There's no better time to play my music
For her, haha, I bet'cha

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'mma make you fall in love, when you leave the club
All I really want you to do is scream my name
And nobody else, just love me girl cause you bad
All by yourself, just love me, girl

[Verse 2: Joelle James]
I can feel you looking my way
Like my body's all alone, you're in a daze
Oh, you think you gonna take me home
You know I'm thinking it too? It's on my mind
Cause I ain't got ones, all I got are hundreds
Don't I look so amazing, when I do it?
Why we still wasting time? Let's do it
Get your car, haha, I bet'cha

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'mma make you fall in love, when you leave the club
All I really want you to do is scream my name
And nobody else, just love me girl cause you bad
All by yourself, just love me, girl

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Joelle James]
Can you love me? Yes, I can love you, I want you, baby, I want you too
Can you love me? I can love you, I want you, yeah
Yeah, can you love me? I can love you, can you love me? Yeah
Ooh, can you love me? Yes, I do, can you love me?
And baby, we can do it all night 'till the morning
Girl, I'll let you ride like a rodeo
And when you ready to go, I'm outside, I got the glasses, I got the liquor
I got the green, I brought the swishers, yeah, we gon' have a good time, yes, we will

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'mma make you fall in love, when you leave the club
All I really want you to do is scream my name
And nobody else, just love me girl cause you bad
All by yourself, just love me, girl
