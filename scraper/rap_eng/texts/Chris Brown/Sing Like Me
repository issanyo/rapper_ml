[Intro]
I got her singing, I got her singing
I got her singing, I got her singing, oh
I got her singing, oh, I got her singing, oh
I got her singing, oh

[Verse 1]
Soon as I step out the whip, they spot me
Girls snapping pictures like the paparazzi
So many different type of women I'm into
And I can't take them all with me is my only issue
I wanna leave out of here, take 'em back to the crib
Show them how to do the chocha, hit it like a Sosa
I wanna leave out of here, take 'em back to the crib
Cause they know what I'm thinking, they look better naked

[Pre-Chorus]
So many ladies, up in this club that I can choose from
And they all look amazing, that's why it's so hard to just pick one

[Chorus]
When I get 'em off to the room, we ain't playing by no rules
And girl singing melodies
And it sounding like your favorite song playing on the radio
And can't get enough of me
Got a girl singing like me
Had a girl singing like me
Got a girl singing like me
Had a girl singing like me

[Verse 2]
All this bottle popping got me feeling nicely
Leaving by myself is highly unlikely
Looking for a right now, don't need no wifey
Settling down with one chick, that ain't even like me
So many women in the atmosphere
Gotta leave with at least three and a pair
The look in they eyes tellin me that they want it
Don't like it that much to put a ring on it

[Pre-Chorus]
So many ladies, up in this club that I can choose from
And they all look amazing, that's why it's so hard to just pick one

[Chorus]
When I get 'em off to the room, we ain't playing by no rules
And girl singing melodies
And it sounding like your favorite song playing on the radio
And can't get enough of me
Got a girl singing like me
Had a girl singing like me
Got a girl singing like me
Had a girl singing like me

[Bridge]
When I'm whispering in your ear, know I got you listening baby
I know you liking what you hear, now let's leave up out of here baby
When I'm whispering in your ear, know I got you listening baby
Cause when I put my hands on you, girl I'm gonna drive your body crazy

[Chorus]
When I get 'em off to the room, we ain't playing by no rules
And girl singing melodies
And it sounding like your favorite song playing on the radio
And can't get enough of me
Got a girl singing like me
Had a girl singing like me
Got a girl singing like me
Had a girl singing like me
When I get 'em off to the room, we ain't playing by no rules
And girl singing melodies
And it sounding like your favorite song playing on the radio
And can't get enough of me
Got a girl singing like me
Had a girl singing like me
Got a girl singing like me
Had a girl singing like me

[Outro]
I got her singing like me, with no autotunes
I got her singing like me, when I get her up in my room
I got her singing like me, make you feel like the boo
I got her singing like, make ya do what it do
I got her singing like me, oh give it to me baby
I got her singing like me
I got her singing like me, oh give it to me baby
Yeah, yeah
When I get you off to my room, baby, baby
When I get you off to my room, baby, oh yeah ,yeah
I got her singing
I got her singing
