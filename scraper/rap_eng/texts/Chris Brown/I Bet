[Verse 1]
I bet you ain't never had it like this, not yet
And I bet you never been like this, so wet
And I bet if a second to last, you gon' be out that dress
And I bet you gon' change when you lay, I can do that dress
Your nigga been blowing up your phone for you all night
And I bet he worried that a nigga like me put it in your life
And I bet I'll buy a few more shots of Patron to the head
And I bet you gon' leave here with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, now, now, now, she got me in love, I bet it all
Soon as she take it off, ooh, that ass so soft
She got me in love, ooh, I bet it all
Soon as she take it off, damn, that ass so soft

[Chorus]
She got me like bet that, bet that, bet that
I put it on you, bet that, bet that, bet that
I put it on you, you take it off and I put it on you
Come jump in my California
Got me like bet that, like bet that, bet that
I put it on you 'cause

[Post-Chorus]
Ass so big, big, you could sit a cup on it
Ass so big, big, make me fall in love on it
Ass so big, big, you could sit a cup on it
Ass so big, big, make me fall in love on it

[Verse 2]
I bet you ain't never been turned out, have him grab your neck
I bet I can get to the spot, no GPS
When I say, "Hello, kitty," you can throw me your plate
Oh, yes, there gon' be a whole bunch of sinning, but you 'bout to feel blessed
When you get to the room, I know
You ain't really gon' miss them clothes
They look much better on the floor
No rules, girl, 'cause lemme see you bend over
Take that when I need it
Call me Mike Jack' when I beat it
I know that I had you coming back for more
So damn bright

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, now, now, now, she got me in love, I bet it all
Soon as she take it off, ooh, that ass so soft
She got me in love, ooh, I bet it all
Soon as she take it off, damn, that ass so soft

[Chorus]
She got me like bet that, bet that, bet that
I put it on you, bet that, bet that, bet that
I put it on you, you take it off and I put it on you
Come jump in my California
Got me like bet that, like bet that, bet that
I put it on you 'cause

[Post-Chorus]
Ass so big, big, you could sit a cup on it
Ass so big, big, make me fall in love on it
Ass so big, big, you could sit a cup on it
Ass so big, big, make me fall in love on it

[Chorus]
Got me like bet that, bet that, bet that
I put it on you, bet that, bet that, bet that
I put it on you, you take it off and I put it on you
Come jump in my California
Got me like bet that, like bet that, bet that
I put it on you 'cause
