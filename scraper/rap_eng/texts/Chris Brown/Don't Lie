[Chorus]
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie, numbers don't lie
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Say what you want but the pockets don't lie
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie, numbers don't lie
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Say what you want but the pockets don't lie
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie, numbers don't lie
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Say what you want but the pockets don't lie

[Verse 1]
Okay you know the name, so you know the drill
Ain't singing candy rain, but I'm so for real
You know like my love do you ever dream of
Candy coated rain drops pouring down high loves?
Ha and I'm all about my Gualas
Even though they say more money more problems
But I don't picture me going on no job hunt
Money piling up now that's something to be proud of
Ha yeah I'm killing 'em, but it's not my fault
Cause I've been on my grind, ha Tony Hawk
And them rims are 28's, martial fuck
My lyrics murdering niggas I need to write a chalk

[Chorus]
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie, numbers don't lie
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Say what you want but the pockets don't lie
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie, numbers don't lie
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Say what you want but the pockets don't lie

[Verse 2]
I'm on Patron and hypnotic, this Gucci on my body
And I'm big big dripping and dipping Kawasaki
Got more kicks than karate, than your son Mr. Miyagi
I'm hotter than wasabi, bet bet better yet Mojave
I'm all about my money so my cash never fold
They be like why you shitting on 'em? Cause I'm a asshole
Everywhere I go I be followed by six hoes
And my checks got a one comma followed by six 0's
Women lie, men lie, go ahead touch it
Money talking if you ain't talking big bucks hush it, up
Duck, cause I'm blowing up
Pockets off that muscle milk, boy they swole as fuck

[Chorus]
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie, numbers don't lie
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Say what you want but the pockets don't lie
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie, numbers don't lie
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Say what you want but the pockets don't lie
