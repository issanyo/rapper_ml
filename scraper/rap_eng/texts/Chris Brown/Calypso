[Verse 1]
Don't need your name, girl, don't need your number
This might seem strange but can't help but wonder
What it would be like, just to be with you
Don't need to move fast, just wanna think it through

[Pre-Chorus]
Like how you hold me
And what you told me
Girl, you don't even know me
Babe, what you tryna do?

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I'm looking in your eyes
Got me thinking 'bout you, wanna take you home
We need to be alone tonight
Tell me what you want, I wanna find out you what you like
You make me say ooh
Just wanna love you
Don't know what you do
Just looking at you
You make me say ooh
Just wanna love you
Don't know what you do
Just looking at you

[Verse 2]
I love the way you move, we're on the right track
Don't be a stranger, girl, bring that ass back
Know who you came with, and I ain't tryna take his place
But you thinking 'bout leaving with me, it's written on your face

[Pre-Chorus]
Like how you want me
How your body calls me
Girl, you don't even know me
Babe, what you tryna do?

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I'm looking in your eyes
Got me thinking 'bout you, wanna take you home
We need to be alone tonight
Tell me what you want, I wanna find out you what you like
You make me say ooh
Just wanna love you
Don't know what you do
Just looking at you
You make me say ooh
Just wanna love you
Don't know what you do
Baby, you're the greatest
Just looking at you
No, I ain't playing

[Bridge]
Oh, let me and you dance tonight
And ain't nobody else but me and your girl, girl
My heart's involved this time
Don't know what it is but you make me say, oh girl, girl
Just wanna love, just wanna love, girl

[Chorus]
You make me say ooh
Just wanna love you
Don't know what you do
Just looking at you
You make me say ooh
Just wanna love you
Don't know what you do
Just looking at you

[Outro]
Yeah, just wanna have you
Wanna have you
Just wanna have you
