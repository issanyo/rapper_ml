[Intro]
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time when we fell in love?
'Cause I remember the night when you had enough of my creeping, oh
You packed up your bags and said you were leaving
You found a new man and said we were even now
Even now
It's funny how everything seems to even out
Even now

[Verse 1]
I wish you could put it behind you
Wish you would put up your blinders
Wish you would stop listening to you friends
And come to where no one would find us
Wish you would just keep your focus on me
So I can give you a reminder
That I can be who I'm supposed to
I can do better, I know you remember

[Pre-Chorus]
Every single night, we were living life in love
Every single time, I was doing right, enough
To keep you around, now look at where I end up
Look where I end up

[Chorus]
Remember the time when we fell in love?
'Cause I remember the night I know you had enough of my creeping, oh
Baby, it was only for a season, maybe

[Verse 2]
And it ain't really had nothing to do with you, it was all really me (no, yeah)
'Cause I was tryna see the world like a dog on a leash (world, leash)
And you was tryna hold me back
I ain't wanna let you go ahead of me (yeah)
I let you go and I knew I should have never let you go ahead of it

[Pre-Chorus]
You remember every single night, we were living life in love
Every single time, I was doing right, enough
To keep you around, now look at where I end up
Look where I end up

[Chorus]
Remember the time when we fell in love?
'Cause I remember the night, I know you had enough of my creeping
Baby, it was only for a season, maybe

[Bridge]
Keep going round, round in circles (keep going round, round in circles)
Hoping you understand my circumstance (hoping you understand my circumstance)
Lord knows I never meant to hurt you (Lord knows I never meant to hurt you)
Is it because I'm a dog now?
Wish I knew then what I know now
I'm not the same when I go out
I just keep it on the low now
Is it because I'm a dog now?
I'm not the same when I go out
Wish I knew then what I know now
I just keep it on the low now

[Chorus]
Don't you remember the time when we fell in love?
'Cause I remember the night, I know you had enough of my creeping
Baby, it was only for a season, maybe

[Outro]
Keep going round, round in circles
Round in circles
Keep, keep, keep going round, round in circles
Round in circles
