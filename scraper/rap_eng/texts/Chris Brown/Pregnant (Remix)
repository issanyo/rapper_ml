[Intro: Chris Brown]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
No, no, no, no, no, I just wanna get
Oh, oh
Let me talk to you for a minute

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Go to the kitchen, let's do it now
You got it coming, uh, I'ma lay you down
Give it to me, girl, uh, I wanna feel
Baby, I'm about to seal the deal
Now I wanna touch, let's warm it up
And you got what I need, make me bust
Oh, I want your body, let me get it from the back
Girl I'm about to attack

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, and knock you up
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, and knock you up

[Interlude: Tyrese]
Do you mind if I talk to you sexy ladies for a minute?
Ooh
Do you mind if I talk to y'all for a minute?
Listen

[Verse 2: Tyrese]
Jump in the shower, it's soaking wet
I'ma give you something I know you won't forget
Just let me come in, open your door
I'ma put it all in, and girl, you gon be sore
I'ma do you on the bar
Wanna play me turn the lights down, down
Lick your ice cream, you can have this chocolate bar
Tonight I'm a take this way too far

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, and knock you up
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, and knock you up

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Now usually I'll leave the club with a girl who has a man
And take her to the hotel for just a one night stand
See I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates
But much like my Patron, man, I'm just tryna take it straight
Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty
The sweetest girl in the world and I mean it and on top of that she's a cutie
I ain't seen nothing like her around here in a while
And if I had a girl, she'd be the one to bear my child
Telling myself I'm a playa so I keep tryna shake it off
But I keep on seeing this big old house with a picket fence and a dog
Never felt nothing like this, she's more than a mistress
I'm about to handle my business, now put that girl in my kitchen

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (that's what I told her)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (ooh)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, and knock you up
