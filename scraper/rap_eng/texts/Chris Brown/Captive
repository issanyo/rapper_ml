[Intro]
PCD, ow

[Post-Chorus]
The jungle, where danger happens
The jungle, I'll take you captive
The jungle, where danger happens
The jungle, I'll take you captive

[Verse 1]
Come take a ride with this wild thing, yeah
I'm the tour guide for this wild safari
I'm tryna take you where my heart is, babe
Not like them other journeys, so far from ordinary

[Pre-Chorus]
I can lure you in, I'm so clever with it
There's really nowhere to run, so you can just forget it
I set a trap and ooh, look how I caught you in it
I'm an animal, ani-ani-ani

[Chorus]
You're coming with me, boy, no need to resist
Won't be released until I'm good and finished
Can't let you leave now
So whatever, whatever just won't work
I'm holding you captive, you can't be released
Captive, holding you captive, captive, I won't let you go
I'm holding you captive, you captive, you wanna leave
Holding you captive, you captive, captive, the answer is no

[Post-Chorus]
The jungle, where danger happens
The jungle, I'll take you captive
The jungle, where danger happens
The jungle, I'll take you captive

[Verse 2]
Now that I got your full attention
I think it's time you learned your lesson
Locking you up and throwing away the key
And boy, you can forget it 'cause you belong to me, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I can lure you in, I'm so clever with it
There's really nowhere to run, so you can just forget it
I set a trap and ooh, look how I caught you in it
I'm an animal, ani-ani-ani

[Chorus]
You're coming with me, boy, no need to resist
Won't be released until I'm good and finished
Can't let you leave now
So whatever, whatever just won't work
I'm holding you captive, you can't be released
Captive, holding you captive, captive, I won't let you go
I'm holding you captive, you captive, you wanna leave
Holding you captive, you captive, captive, the answer is no

[Post-Chorus]
The jungle, where danger happens
The jungle, I'll take you captive
The jungle, where danger happens
The jungle, I'll take you captive

[Bridge]
Go Pussycat, go Pussycat Dolls
Go Pussycat, go Pussycat Dolls

[Pre-Chorus]
I can lure you in, I'm so clever with it
There's really nowhere to run, so you can just forget it
I set a trap and ooh, look how I caught you in it
I'm an animal, ani-ani-ani

[Chorus]
You're coming with me, boy, no need to resist
Won't be released until I'm good and finished
Can't let you leave now
So whatever, whatever just won't work
I'm holding you captive, you can't be released
Captive, holding you captive, captive, I won't let you go
I'm holding you captive, you captive, you wanna leave
Holding you captive, you captive, captive, the answer is no
