Skinny dip deep in your sea, coming up 'til I can't breath, uh

Take one look around, they say, "That youngin’ gettin' a lot"
100k spent on my watch (Watch)
Tried but can't fit in my spot (Ugh)
Gettin' the cake, I'm a natural
New bitch better than my last one

Counting paper, rolling gas
Niggas'll probably switch up on you fast
Tried stay hunnid with you but they can't
I take them younger niggas straight to class
All my money come in stacks, yeah
Rolling paper up and pass, yeah
Tailors don't know how to act, yeah
Handful of racks (Handful of racks)
Room full of plaques (Room full of plaques)
