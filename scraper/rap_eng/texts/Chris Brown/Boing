[Intro]
Chris Brown, FAME on the way
Ay, what it is baby? DJ Babey Drew
I'mma do some thangs, then you gon' do some thangs
I see you in your zone, I'm in my zone too

[Chorus]
Yeah, we be bouncing like the springs on the bed
(And we bouncing like the springs on the bed)
And I love it when you give me some (ha-ha-ha-ha, oh)
Let’s switch and let me do you instead
Though I love the way you give it to me
Girl (Girl), we be bouncing like the springs on the bed
(Bouncing like the springs on the bed)
You gon' love it when I give you some (ha-ha-ha-ha, oh)
Switch and let you do me instead
Cause I love when you give it to me, give it to me, boing

[Verse 1]
Kiss you there and then you go down and up
I know that it's a little much but girl I'm so tempted to touch, boing
It’s heating up, 90 degrees I’ll beat it up
Oscar De La Hoya baby Spanish flying in your love, boing
Bouncing off of my pogo stick, your cotton candy gummy bears
I can’t get enough of it, boing
Your chocolate covered Hershey kiss
Come and blow my candle out, I promise you can make a wish

[Chorus]
Yeah, we be bouncing like the springs on the bed
(And we bouncing like the springs on the bed)
And I love it when you give me some (ha-ha-ha-ha, oh)
Let’s switch and let me do you instead
Though I love the way you give it to me
Girl (Girl), we be bouncing like the springs on the bed
(Bouncing like the springs on the bed)
You gon' love it when I give you some (ha-ha-ha-ha, oh)
Switch and let you do me instead
Cause I love when you give it to me, boing

[Verse 2]
When you’re down, one two three I won that round
Bedroom bully you should know me baby girl a lot of sounds, boing
All of the sound that you make, take a second, catch your breath
I'm on the way, boing
Cause girl I got that magic potion
Rowing back and forth, yeah that's the motion in the ocean, boing
And I take you away, more than once in a day
Cause baby girl I catch ya, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah (Yeah), we be bouncing like the springs on the bed
(And we bouncing like the springs on the bed)
And I love it when you give me some (ha-ha-ha-ha, oh)
Let’s switch and let me do you instead (Cause, girl, I love you)
Though I love the way you give it to me
Girl (Girl), we be bouncing like the springs on the bed
(Bouncing like the springs on the bed)
You gon' love it when I give you some (ha-ha-ha-ha, oh)
Switch and let you do me instead
Cause I love when you give it to me

[Bridge]
Do it to me I’ll return the favour, baby we can do it now or later
It’s up to you, tell me what you wanna do, just space and opportunity in between us
You ain’t expect me to make that, make that thang bounce, you ain’t expect me to take that, take that thang down
You ain’t expect to bounce like the springs in the bed, so let me give it to you 'til you’re shaking your legs

[Chorus]
Yeah, we be bouncing like the springs on the bed
(And we bouncing like the springs on the bed)
And I love it when you give me some (ha-ha-ha-ha, oh)
Let’s switch and let me do you instead
Though I love the way you give it to me
Girl (Girl), we be bouncing like the springs on the bed
(Bouncing like the springs on the bed)
You gon' love it when I give you some (ha-ha-ha-ha, oh)
Switch and let you do me instead
Cause I love when you give it to me, give it to me
