[Verse 1]
Girl, I know lately, we haven't talked much
'Cause I've been away so we've been out of touch
But that doesn't mean I don't love you
That doesn't mean that I'm not always thinking of you, oh
I told people that I missed you
They say that you've been acting real different
Now everybody's looking at me like I'm crazy
Telling me you've got something that you wanna say to me, woah

[Chorus]
Tell me why was I the last to know
That you got plans of walking out my door
Don't do this to me, girl, talk to me
You don't have to leave
Can't believe that I'm the guy who had to be the last to know
That you got plans of walking out my door
Don't do this to me, girl, talk to me
You don't have to leave, can't believe
That I'm the last to know

[Verse 2]
I'm taking the red-eye out to be more
You saying I was being less but I'm tryna be more
Oh, girl, I didn't know, I was always gone
You were lonely, so you found somebody else to hold on
You wanna show me how it feels to be all alone
I'm tryna make it right with you, I don't wanna fight with you, hey, hey
And I'm damn sure I don't wanna spend my life
Wishing I spend my life with you

[Chorus]
Tell me why was I the last to know
That you got plans of walking out my door
Don't do this to me, girl, talk to me
You don't have to leave
Can't believe that I'm the guy who had to be the last to know
That you got plans of walking out my door
Don't do this to me, girl, talk to me
You don't have to leave, can't believe
That I'm the last to know

[Verse 3]
Picture of perfection, tryna let all my stupid adolescence go
I want to be a man about it, even though I know your heart says no
Girl, I'm no good without ya, let me wrap my heart around ya
'Cause you're my baby girl, put your bags on the floor
Tell me what I did to get us to this point
Didn't know the clock was ticking and it came for me, oh
I need you, babe, I'm breaking down
Oh, so tell me

[Chorus]
Tell me why was I the last to know
That you got plans of walking out my door
Don't do this to me, girl, talk to me
You don't have to leave
Can't believe that I'm the guy who had to be the last to know
That you got plans of walking out my door
Don't do this to me, girl, talk to me
You don't have to leave, can't believe
That I'm the last to know
