[Intro: Pleasure P]
Ladies this your song
From Miami to the Bay
Ladies this your song
I'm calling out
All the girls in the club tonight, yeah
Put your hands in the air if you gon' let a player cut

[Chorus: J. Valentine]
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah
(I beat it, beat it)

[Verse 1: J. Valentine]
Say baby, I really want to drive you crazy tonight
Lil' mama, wanna see them toes way up in the sky
Turn around, let me see it from the back
I know you like it when I hit it like that
From the bottom to the top
Want to see that waterfall drop, drop, drop, drop
Girl, I know you gon' tell your friends
That's why I gotta beat it up like this
Running your mouth like damn
Now they wanna know if I can give it to them

[Chorus: J. Valentine]
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah, ooh, yeah
(I beat it, beat it)

[Verse 2: Pleasure P]
Aw shorty, gonna throw it so deep it touch your spine
Ooh mama, don't be afraid to let me play with your mind
You know what I'm talking 'bout, in the bedroom or the couch
I'ma have you screaming out
So baby, gon' take that thing
To the house like a football game
Tattoo your back like a jersey
All you gonna see is my name

[Chorus: J. Valentine]
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah
(I beat it, beat it)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Got me like damn, your booty done something to my mind
And yes ma'am, I just wanna take up all of your time
And I don't care if you a stripper, baby
'Cause what I got, it might tip ya over
Ha, look, I'm lookin' at the way your body just massage your minds
I know you feel me, girl, I'm all up inside your mind
She be like, "Stop, please, baby, don't go"
While I be starin' at her weave like it's gon' grow
Go back to the room, yeah, it's hammer time
Take your clothes off, let your pajamas fly
And keep it goin' with the motion
She off her pill so you know her body rollin'

[Chorus: J. Valentine & Chris Brown]
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah (oh, ooh, woah)
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah (yeah)
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah (I, I, I, I, no, no, no)
I beat it, beat it up, up, up, up, up..., yeah ('cause I, no, no, no, no)
(I beat it, beat it)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Let me get it, girl
