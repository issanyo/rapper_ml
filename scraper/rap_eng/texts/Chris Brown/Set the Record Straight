[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
Hold up, lemme catch my breath, nigga watch yo step
I'm in the game, it ain't no rules, we'll knock off refs (blaow, blaow)
Don't leave the crib without them racks, without my vest, my strap (my strap)
Yo bitch got some good neck-neck, my wrist wet, neck wet (neck wet)
And I got big boy Patek, cash don't take checks
You gon' do what? (Blaow, blaow), nigga, I don't take threats (threats)
Hellcat on yo block (skrrt), I treat her like racetrack (skrrt)
Get in the booth, state facts (facts), I don't pay for sex (facts)
But I take care of my hoes (my bitches), buy bundles, bags and oil (facts)
I just bought one a boutique (that's love), ain't gotta go to the mall (that's love)
I had to show off for that one (forreal), she give me head on call (forreal)
I'm gon' finish countin' this money, with my wrist on thaw (froze)
Demolition man, knock down yo bitch wall (her walls)
Knock down yo big homie (big homie), courtesy of my young dawg (young dawg)
Keep it real with yourself if nobody else (nobody else)
You the realest nigga breathin' if I hold my breath

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Drink all night (drink all night, yeah)
And let's play a little naughty (play a little)
Got my hands on thighs (got my hands on her thighs)
Got into foreplay, I'ma take my time
You know it's okay (that a good thing)
Show me, babe (it's about time)
You and I (yeah)
Set the record straight (aw, yeah)
Fuck it up

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Say what's in the bag, get it too fast, spendin' a check today
Makin' it last, we payin' the tax, I'm too caught up in the race
When I'm doin' bad, where was you at? I'm only speakin' the facts
You wanna play follow the leader, you really 'bout it, got my name on your ass
Lock down, lock down, baby, when I lock it down, down
I need the energy right now, turn up, don't pipe down
Look at me, if you need, I'll pull up
She hit me up, said she tryna fuck, buckle up
I gotta smoke a J, she take it to the face
On or off, babe? Fuck with you the long way
Smoke some weed, babe, fuck what he say
Know what you need, babe, as we play, yeah
No, you don't gotta tell anybody
Just throw it and keep givin' me problems
So good in the morning, need a doctor
I'll keep going, I'ma give it to you proper

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Drink all night (drink all night, yeah)
And let's play a little naughty (play a little)
Got my hands on thighs (got my hands on her thighs)
Got into foreplay, I'ma take my time
Baby, it's okay (I made up my mind)
Show me, babe (it's about time)
You and I
Set the record straight
Fuck it up
