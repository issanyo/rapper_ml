I got Wi-Fi, got Xans, got that gas and some drink
Girl, invite your bitches, we gon' party all week
Know you got a man, girl, your secret's safe with me
All my niggas' shooters, so you know they don't speak
Girl, you know I keep it litty, leave you with a hangover
Shake your ass and show your titties
You know why you came over
