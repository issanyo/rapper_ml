I'm traffickin' bricks, that X is just how I manoeuvre
Whippin' that dope, trappin' it right out the Uber
You need that work, get it right to ya
I'ma pull up with the driver, bricks we can trap out the Uber
Bricks we can trap out the Uber, bricks we can trap out the Uber
My niggas trap out the Uber, smart niggas trap out the Uber
All of my niggas is shooters, I just pull up in the Uber
Trap out that Uber, trap out that Uber, the trap gon' trap up on me too

[Verse 1: Bricc Baby]
You need that chicken, you need them pounds

Call up my driver, right out the L
Then I'ma bring it right to you
Nigga, I pull up with Ruegers

You try to roll up, I'll shoot you

Payin' his rent for that money
Drivin' that Uber, they get there snappy
Makin' these plays that I be
Drivin' they tummy, I ride with my tommy

He tell me cound me
Then I put the bricks in the trap, then back to the trap
And one day, on my own

I trap with my niggas from day one
You know my homies is crazy
Better strap up when that day come
My niggas just no hesitation
Callin' the driver to pick me up
I got the pack comin' the way
It's fresh off the stove, you know I cook
Hop in the whip andel√©
Zip it up, pack it up, light it up
Smokin' that California, are you high enough?
Sippin' codeine but this time, I ain't buyin' up
Bitch shake her booty like she doesn't give a fuck
Man, I got pills, man, I got weed
Trap out the Uber, sippin' codeine
The bitch wanna know what it's hittin' for
She just wanna fuck with a pretty boy, bitch

Why would I not take a Uber?
Why would I take the rich driver?
Hoe wanna drive when they geeked up
Gone off that codeine and molly
I wish that Uber had more
I take them bricks to the hideout
I Uber flights for your bitch
I took her on helicopters
Pull up that chopper
Let them hoes know it's gon' bang if you ride
Pull up the trap
Let them hoes fuck, it's gon' bang if you ride
Pull up the Uber
That Uber, that Uber, my getaway driver
Feel like I'm a god
Traffickin' bricks and I'm feelin' so high
