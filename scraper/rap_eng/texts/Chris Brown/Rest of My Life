[Intro: Kevin McCall]
K, K, K-Mac
Cuff your chick

[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
Baby love, it's getting cold, hold me
My head's down, soaked sheets, many tears
Might have to go away tonight
'Cause I gotta feeling my days are numbered, this might be the day

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin McCall]
I close my eyes for eternal sleep
No more waking up to Sunday morning now
Live to learn, learned a lot
Tonight I'm clocking out

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
This is my last kiss, my last wish
My last chance, my last dance
Last gift to give you my love
It's the last time I'm holding you
Spend the rest of my life with you tonight
Spend the rest of my life with you tonight
Spend the rest of my life with you tonight
Spend the rest of my life with you, my life with you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
The walls are closing in, yeah
Wondering when I'll see you again
In your mind you wonder why
So this time I won't be right back
But I'll be a shining star
A memory in your heart

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
I close my eyes for eternal sleep
No more waking up to Sunday morning now
Live to learn, learned a lot
Tonight I'm clocking out

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
This is my last kiss, my last wish (last kiss, last wish)
My last chance, my last dance (woah, oh)
Last gift to give you my love (woah)
It's the last time I'm holding you
Spend the rest of my life with you tonight
Spend the rest of my life with you tonight
Spend the rest of my life with you tonight
Spend the rest of my life with you, my life with you

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin McCall]
I close my eyes for eternal sleep
No more waking up to Sunday morning now
Live to learn, learned a lot
Tonight I'm clocking out

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
This is my last kiss, my last wish
My last chance, my last dance
Last gift to give you my love
It's the last time I'm holding you
