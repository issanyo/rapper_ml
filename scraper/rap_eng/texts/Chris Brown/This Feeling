I’m focused on lies, all through the skies
Couldn’t even imagine, this is one hell of a high
Pressure is on, all in my zone
No interruptions, I gotta turn off my phone, yeah
Normally I ain’t the type to do it
But I had to see what it’s like so I took a little bit to calm my nerves
Ended up dancing through the nights
Everything around me came to life
Music got loud, it’s only right
Kept on going, the sun was rising
Damn, done missed my fucking flight
I’m off to imagina, stayed a few days at a time, oh yeah
Feel like I’m loosing my-
Feel like I’m loosing my mind, oh yeah
Gotta regain control, gotta regain control
Before my mind explode
But I do not wanna turn back, can I stay right where I’m at

[Chorus]
Cause I love this feeling, oh yeah
I love this feeling
