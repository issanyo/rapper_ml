[Verse 1:]
Fell in love with nothing right
It's like I seen it, but ignored the signs
All the things you said with no regrets
Who cares about the hurt?
Who cares about me girl?
Who cares about me girl?
Do you care about me girl?

[Hook:]
Cause if you did, then you wouldn't leave. Ooh no
And if you did, my heart would be beating
But it ain't beating, no, no, no, ain't beating
My heart it ain't beating, no, no, no, ain't beating
Was it true, oh why?

[Sevyn harmonize:]
[?]
I love my baby, she lifts me up

[Verse 2:]
Girl I put you first in everything?
How could your mouth lash out on me?
Ooh, was this the same girl?
Who wouldn't leave without saying I love you?
[?] Girl you never cared about me girl
Who cares about me girl?
Oh, do you care about me girl?

[Hook:]
Cause if you did, then you wouldn't leave. Ooh no
And if you did, my heart would be beating
But it ain't beating, no, no, no, ain't beating
My heart it ain't beating, no, no, no, ain't beating
Was it true, oh why?

Cause if you did, then you wouldn't leave. Ooh no
