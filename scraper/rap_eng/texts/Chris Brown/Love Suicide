[Intro: Ester Dean]
Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide

[Verse 1: Ester Dean]
It's a long day, fast paced, going nowhere
I was looking for love, someone I could trust, thought you'd be there
Life gets so lonely but what do we care
You're my only but you weren't there
Strings of lies ocean wide, I'm running at a wall, and I
I wish that I could look inside your mind
I've been waiting for the day when you would realize
What we have comes along just once in a lifetime

[Chorus: Ester Dean & Chris Brown]
Tell me the reason why
You committed love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose
I'm all out of tears
Time to get outta here
You made it very clear
You did it on purpose, purpose
You did it on purpose, purpose
To make me feel worthless, worthless
Why would you hurt us, hurt us?
You did it on purpose, purpose
You did it on purpose, purpose
To make me feel worthless, worthless
Why would you hurt us, hurt us?

[Verse 2: Ester Dean]
You've became a stranger, a murderer and I was your target
My heart's in danger for hurting and you're the number one suspect
If there was a secret that I need to know
Now we'll make all the love in your heart began to flow
It was stupid of me to think I was enough
Why should I hold on when you're giving up? Hey

[Chorus: Ester Dean & Chris Brown]
Tell me the reason why
You committed love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose
I'm all out of tears
Time to get outta here
You made it very clear
You did it on purpose, purpose
You did it on purpose, purpose
To make me feel worthless, worthless
Why would you hurt us, hurt us?
You did it on purpose, purpose
You did it on purpose, purpose
To make me feel worthless, worthless
Why would you hurt us, hurt us?

[Bridge: Ester Dean]
Does it make you happy to see me down?
Does it make your day to see me drown?
I guess I'm your entertainment
You don't know what you wasted
But soon you will see
Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide

[Chorus: Ester Dean & Chris Brown]
Tell me the reason why
You committed love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose
I'm all out of tears
Time to get outta here
You made it very clear
You did it on purpose, purpose
You did it on purpose, purpose
To make me feel worthless, worthless
Why would you hurt us, hurt us?
You did it on purpose, purpose
You did it on purpose, purpose
To make me feel worthless, worthless
Why would you hurt us, hurt us?
