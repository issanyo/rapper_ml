[Intro: Chris Brown]
Hey, hey, hey
Alright Sevyn
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Sevyn Streeter & (Chris Brown)]
Baby, don't kill the fun (I won't)
This ain't over until we say it's done (alright)
It's your life, go ahead, do what you choose
Put me in your, your favorite mood (let's get it)
Oh baby, don't kill the vibe
Turn it down we gotta let it ride (hahaha)
I found you, crowned you, I turned you on (yeah)
So you know, I got, what you want

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & (Chris Brown)]
'Cause it ain't like you, can take it with you when you go (nah)
It's only right to make it beautiful (call the cops)
Let's be undeniable, don't kill the fun
If you wanna live it, gotta live it
Make tonight unforgettable, don't kill the fun
And we won't stop rocking 'til they call the cops

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & (Chris Brown)]
Aaah, don't kill the fun, I can't
Aaah, don't kill the fun, I won't
Aaah, let's be undeniable (let's get it)
Aaah, and we won't stop rocking 'til they call the cops

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
Oh baby, don't kill the fun
We can only chase it if we run
Body to body, it's all for free
Now come get this L-O-V-E

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & (Chris Brown)]
Oh, 'cause it ain't like you, can take it with you when you go (oh)
It's only right to make it beautiful (yeah)
Let's be undeniable (oh yeah, oh yeah)
If you wanna live it, gotta live it
Make tonight unforgettable (oh yeah, oh yeah)
And we won't stop rocking 'til they call the cops

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & (Chris Brown)]
Aaah, don't kill the fun, I can't
Aaah, don't kill the fun, I won't
Aaah, let's be undeniable (babe)
Aaah, and we won't stop rocking 'til they call the cops

[Verse 3: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
Lay down, no over thinking
Get it though, this picture we painting
'Til 3 in the morning, 3 in the morning
All night we on, we make the party come to life
Life, don't kill the fun, me and you

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & (Chris Brown)]
Let's be undeniable, don't kill the fun (oh, baby)
If you wanna live it, gotta live it
Make tonight unforgettable, don't kill the fun (let's get it, won't stop)
Won't stop rocking, no

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter  & (Chris Brown)]
Aaah, don't kill the fun, I can't, no, no
Aaah, don't kill the fun, I won't (don't do it)
Aaah, let's be undeniable
Aaah, and we won't stop rocking 'til they call the cops (let's get it)

[Outro: Sevyn Streeter]
I can't, I won't
Unde-undeniable
I can't, I won't
Unde-undeniable
Call the cops
