[Intro]
Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah, go

[Verse 1]
This may be my last time, so I'mma do whatever
This may be my last chance, for me and you together
I can be your honeycomb and we can fly together
You're so sweet, I taste it baby, I just, I just

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna see you putting it together like a number
Multiply the times we done took it, our love
Or maybe we should just add up our love
I know your heart, your kiss drives me crazy, babe
We don't gotta fake this shit when we're loving
Cause the other ones got it and they be lying about it
Can't live a day in the life
Just do what you you like

[Chorus]
Do what you like, do what you like, do what you like
Come on baby, it's your world I wanna live in and I'm loving this feeling
Do what you like, do what you like, do what you like
Just like that, girl I know you like that and we only got time to love

[Verse 2]
This won't be my last chance, so I'mma do whatever
To get you out of here, so I'mma be smooth and clever
Let me get in your comfort zone, girl, we can move together
Spinning 'round, I got you baby, I just, I just

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna see you putting it together like a number
Multiply the times we done took it, our love
Or maybe we should just add up our love
I know your heart, your kiss drives me crazy, babe
We don't gotta fake this shit when we're loving
Cause the other ones got it and they be lying about it
Can't live a day in the life
Just do what you you like

[Chorus]
Do what you like, do what you like, do what you like
Come on baby, it's your world I wanna live in and I'm loving this feeling
Do what you like, do what you like, do what you like
Just like that, girl I know you like that and we only got time to love
Do what you like, do what you like, do what you like
Come on baby, it's your world I wanna live in and I'm loving this feeling
Do what you like, do what you like, do what you like
Just like that, girl I know you like that and we only got time to love

[Bridge]
Said we only got time and we only got time to love
We, we only got time, we only got time to love
To love, to love and we only got time to love
Got it, 'bout it, said we got time

[Chorus]
Do what you like, do what you like, do what you like
Come on baby, it's your world I wanna live in and I'm loving this feeling
Do what you like, do what you like, do what you like
Just like that, girl I know you like that and we only got time to love
Do what you like, do what you like, do what you like
Come on baby, it's your world I wanna live in and I'm loving this feeling
Do what you like, do what you like, do what you like
Just like that, girl I know you like that and we only got time to love

[Outro]
Yeah, time to love
Said we only got time to love
Said we only got time to love, baby
