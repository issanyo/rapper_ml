[Verse 1]
Everybody sees it's you
I'm the one that lost the view
Everybody says we're through
I hope you haven't said it too

[Pre-Chorus]
So where do we go from here
With all this fear in our eyes?
And where can love take us now?
We've been so far down, we can still touch the sky

[Chorus]
If we crawl 'til we can walk again
Then we'll run until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love, yeah
Back to love, yeah

[Verse 2]
Why did I change the pace?
Hearts were never meant to race
Always felt the need for space
And now I can't reach your face

[Pre-Chorus]
So where are you standing now?
Are you in the crowd of my faults?
Love, can't you see my hand?
I need one more chance, we can still have it all

[Chorus]
So we'll crawl 'til we can walk again
Then we'll run until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love, yeah
Back to love, yeah

[Bridge]
Everybody see's it's you
Well, I never wanna lose that view

[Chorus]
So we'll crawl 'til we can walk again
Then we'll run until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
So we'll crawl 'til we can walk again
Then we'll run until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love
