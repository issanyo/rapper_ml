[Verse 1]
Whine up pon it to the rhythm (to the rhythm)
Come a little closer, why you distant? (Why you distant?)
All over my body, feel the friction (feel the friction)
Yeah, baby, it's me that's in your system (in your system)
Kill it, girl, your body lookin' vicious (lookin' vicious)
Meditating on you like a scripture (a scripture)
Ain't at church but she pull up in them Christians (Christians)
Long time, I go love you like it's vintage

[Chorus]
Go forward, go back and forward, oh
Enjoy it, just pick your poison, oh, ooh
Go slower, go fast, go slower and around and around
Go back and forward, ooh
Rock your body, your body, your body, ooh
Rock your body, your body, your body, ooh (your body, your body, your body)
Rock your body, oh gimme what you got, I'm holding on
Oh, rock your body on me now

[Verse 2]
Why you always lookin' at the time though? (Time though)
Baby, when you dance on me time slows (time slows)
Murder everyting at the nitro (nitro)
Take you back to my space like a typo (typo)
Tell me how to reach like a high note (high note, oh yeah)
Skin tight, never need lipo (lipo)
I can see us with my eyes closed (eyes closed)
Pull it to side like 5-O (5-O)

[Chorus]
Go forward, go back and forward, oh
Enjoy it, just pick your poison, oh, ooh (just pick your poison)
Go slower, go fast, go slower and around and around (slower, and around and around, oh)
Go back and forward, ooh (rock your body)
Rock your body, your body, your body, ooh
Rock your body, your body, your body, ooh (rock your body, your body, ooh)
Rock your body, oh gimme what you got, I'm holding on (rock your body)
Oh, rock your body on me now
Go forward, go back and forward, oh
Enjoy it, just pick your poison, oh, ooh
Go slower, go fast, go slower and around and around (slower, go fast, go slower and around and around)
Go back and forward, ooh, ooh
Rock your body, your body, your body, ooh
Rock your body, your body, your body, ooh (rock your body, your body, ooh)
Rock your body, oh gimme what you got, I'm holding on (rock your body)
Oh, rock your body on me now
