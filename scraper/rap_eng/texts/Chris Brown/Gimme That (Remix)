[Intro: Lil Wayne]
What it is, folk, this right here is the sixteen-year old phenom
Chris Breezy, me, myself, I'm the  23 year old CEO

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Young Carter, I'm harder than them other boys
I ain't even fronting baby I can take a summer off
I can break a woman off, I can take the stomach off
One of my, trucks, now I'm riding in the goods
Line it on up, guarantee you get served
Lil Chris, said run it, so I ran and told her
I'm a Cash Money young'n, Birdman Junior
Just a president, looking for a moniker

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
The young boy just turned 16 and I got 64's and hot bikes that I rock
Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock, but all that swinging in that bikini just make 'em vicious
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop cause you speaking that slang that I talk
That sassy tempo with that walk, maybe the reason that all these teenies may never see me

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot, gimme that
You be talking like you like what I got, gimme that
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme, gimme, gimme
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot, gimme that
You be talking like you like what I got, gimme that
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme, gimme, gimme

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Ma, take a break, let me explain to you, what your body got a young boy ready to do
If you take a chance to let me put them things on you, I could show you why I make them straight, A's in school
I'm a hustler, trust my frame and age, got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page
I can picture us switching lanes in the Coupe, with you on the phone screaming my name, Chris

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot, gimme that
You be talking like you like what I got, gimme that
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme, gimme, gimme
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot, gimme that
You be talking like you like what I got, gimme that
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme, gimme, gimme

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Girl you serious and I been watching you, this's what your body's saying
Hey, yeah, this what your body's saying, ow

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Weezy baby, baby what it do, I'm tryna holla at cha
I ain't upset, but I'll blind you if I smile at ya
You rocking with young Chris and the best rapper
So leave your phone, bring your friends, let the rest happen
A lil Patron, a lil Hen', I'm on Cavalli Vodka
I'm in Cavalli jeans, got on Cavalli boxers, I'm fresher than a newborn
And um I can work you out like a futon
And um you can leave your birthday suit on
I'mma leave my boots on, I'mma leave my jewels on
Never know what you want, I'mma leave that tool on
Never know who home, I learned that from a Biggie song
On to a new one, some like a redbone
Oh I think she like me, she got me on a ringtone
And I told her, "Get yours, girl, and don't you stop"
Now gimme that funk, that gushy stuff
Oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot, gimme that
You be talking like you like what I got, gimme that
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme, gimme, gimme
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot, gimme that
You be talking like you like what I got, gimme that
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme, gimme, gimme

[Outro: Chris Brown]
VA, yeah ha
Yeah ma don't be fronting like you don't know what's going on, aight, yeah
