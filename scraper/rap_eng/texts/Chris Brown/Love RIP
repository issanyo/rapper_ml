[Verse 1]
I wonder why, it's always friction
Always tension, to get my attention
And I’ve waited, been so patient
So sick and tired of your lying, I can’t take it
I'm flipping hysterical, this is life
We can’t change it
We’re like the pyramids aligned with Orion

[Pre-Chorus]
How could a love that's so new
Feel so ancient?
I guess that love, runs out of love eventually
I can’t change what's meant to be

[Chorus]
It's like it's our final destination
All this love we made
We gon’ let it fade away
It's time, yeah, to let it die now (die, die)
‘Fore I let you kill me
I'm gon’, I'm gon’, I'm gon’
I'm gon’ let love rest in peace
Love rest in peace, I’m gon’, I’m gon'

[Verse 2]
This love is a battlefield
I'm just a soldier
I need to call a cavalry
‘Cause you’re taking over
Without all these different emotions
Hold onto your ulterior motive
And girl, I don’t get the fight with you
You can't have that, I just want it all back
‘Cause I planned to spend my life with you
And now it's rainy days and dark clouds
Tears feel like rain on my window
Baby, can you tell me

[Pre-Chorus]
How could a love that's so new
Feel so ancient?
I guess that love, runs out of love eventually
I can’t change what's meant to be

[Chorus]
It's like it's our final destination
All this love we made
We gon’ let it fade away
It's time, yeah, to let it die now (die, die)
Before I let you kill me
I'm gon’, I'm gon’, I'm gon’
Girl, love rest in peace, I’m gon’, I’m gon'

[Bridge]
Baby, ‘cause all of our love (love rest in peace)
Right now is resting in peace (I’m gon, I’m gon’)
Baby, I can’t take this love
You know, that you're killing me, babe (I’m gon')

[Outro]
Oh, oh, girl, you’re killing me, baby
You’re trouble, babe
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, oh, oh
