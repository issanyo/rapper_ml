[Verse 1]
Girl let me get this tri-pod, make sure that the angle's right
Don't know if you know your lines, so this might just take all night
Baby get up on the bed, I'll do all the things you like
Everything that I wanna do, to you
Girl your wardrobe is the same suit that you wore on your birthday
Baby girl, ooh I want you, want you in the worst way
Now I'm gonna film you like I wanted to since the first day
Now I got a chance to, baby I got plans for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Me, you take one, cut cut, me, you take two, cut cut
Me, you take three same scene and it's us in between the sheets, oh ah
Me, you take four, from the bed down to the floor
Baby you so good, I feel like you deserve an award
From the way you put that thing on me girl it's a dream
And I know all the things to do
So baby we can make a film, watch it over and over again
And I will play the lead to you

[Chorus]
We'll make a movie, movie
You'll play the starring role and I'll direct you on where to go
We'll make a movie, movie
Up and down and round and round baby, just you follow, I'll show you what to do
We'll make a movie, movie
We'll make a movie, movie
We'll make a movie, movie
We'll make a movie and I'll let you do me, do me

[Verse 2]
Baby let's do role play, I can be anything you like
Use your imagination, now just gonna close your eyes
Puedo ser tú corazón, y tal vez tú profesor
I can be your doctor, girl bet I make it better

[Pre-Chorus]
Me, you take one, cut cut, me, you take two, cut cut
Me, you take three same scene and it's us in between the sheets, oh ah
Me, you take four, from the bed down to the floor
Baby you so good, I feel like you deserve an award
From the way you put that thing on me girl it's a dream
And I know all the things to do
So baby we can make a film, watch it over and over again
And I will play the lead to you

[Chorus]
We'll make a movie, movie
You'll play the starring role and I'll direct you on where to go
We'll make a movie, movie
Up and down and round and round baby, just you follow, I'll show you what to do
We'll make a movie, movie
We'll make a movie, movie
We'll make a movie, movie
We'll make a movie and I'll let you do me, do me

[Bridge]
The award for the best love scene in a movie, movie
Goes out to you, oh oh
Girl you're the best really and truly, truly
By the things that you do, oh oh

[Chorus]
We'll make a movie, movie
You'll play the starring role and I'll direct you on where to go
We'll make a movie, movie
Up and down and round and round baby, just you follow, I'll show you what to do
We'll make a movie, movie
We'll make a movie, movie
We'll make a movie, movie
We'll make a movie and I'll let you do me, do me
