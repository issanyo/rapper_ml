[Verse 1]
Stepped in the party through the front door
I got a couple little bad bitches with us
You see the bottles, look at 'em shine, baby
I call your girl over, now you got your bitches
You say that I'm playing
But I'm taking that down tonight
And if your friends coming over to party
That means foreplay, m√©nage

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on ladies, put it on me
Nice and slowly, now speed it up
Go 'head make them sounds
Scream for me, yeah

[Chorus]
That's your girlfriend, yeah, she on deck
Lamborghini Masi', yeah, a nigga gon' flex
She wear my chain, gimme neck
I bang that pussy like I'm throwing up my set
Girl, you freaky
I'ma show 'em how to ride the pony
Freaky
I started busting, it's the champagne

[Verse 2]
Shawty said she fucking with the campaign
I ain't worried 'bout nothing, not a damn thang
Dark Knight Lamborghini, Bruce Wayne
Give a fuck about my old hoe, I'm riding 'round in that new thang
Staring at your body, tryna do thangs
Throwing all these hunnids, girl, that's loose change
And do it all for the ladies
Pop it, pop it for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on ladies, put it on me
Nice and slowly, now speed it up
Go 'head make them sounds
Scream for me, yeah

[Chorus]
That's your girlfriend, yeah, she on deck
Lamborghini Masi', yeah, a nigga gon' flex
She wear my chain, gimme neck
I bang that pussy like I'm throwing up my set
Girl, you freaky
I'ma show 'em how to ride the pony
She freaky
I started busting, it's the champagne

[Verse 3]
This ain't my first time, I'm shinin', I been used to this shit
But it's the first time I had your girl and her chain glued to my dick, ha
Picture me rollin', 100 bad bitches, that pussy is soakin'
Nigga, this OHB, just me and my whoadies
Gold chains, don't fuck up my clique though
No names, show up with that pistol
I'm pistol [?], I don't need a scope
I let the thing ring out, adios

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on ladies, put it on me
Nice and slowly, now speed it up
Go 'head make them sounds
Scream for me, yeah

[Chorus]
That's your girlfriend, yeah, she on deck
Lamborghini Masi', yeah, a nigga gon' flex
She wear my chain, gimme neck
I bang that pussy like I'm throwing up my set
Girl, you freaky
I'ma show 'em how to ride the pony
She freaky
I started busting, it's the champagne
