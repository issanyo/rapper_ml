[Intro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Jawan Harris]
I be up in Mars, I be up in Mars (ayy, ayy)
I be so fly, I can touch the stars (ayy, ayy)
I be up in Mars, I be up in Mars (ayy, ayy)
When you see that spaceship, yup, that's my car (okay)
Catch me on another planet, catch me on another planet
Catch me on another planet, I be up in Mars
I be on another planet
I be on another planet, I be on another planet
(We have lift off)

[Verse 1: Jawan Harris]
I be in the mall, I be in the mall
With the new space jams, never seen before
Know what I go on, can't find it in the store
I'm 'bout to blast off, Scotty beam me home
The spaceship that I'm riding in is sitting on that chrome
So why don't you get up on in here and push that button and we can be gone
Ain't no Lamborghini faster than what I got
Ain't no Maserati cleaner than what I got (zoom)

[Pre-Chorus: Jawan Harris]
1 planet, 2 planet, 3 planet, 4
Zoom past the moon and about 5 more (zoom)
1 planet, 2 planet, 3 planet, 4
What'chu waiting on, girl? Let's go, go (zoom)

[Chrous: Chris Brown]
I be up in Mars, I be up in Mars (ayy, ayy)
I be so fly, I can touch the stars (ayy, ayy)
I be up in Mars, I be up in Mars (ayy, ayy)
When you see that spaceship, yup, that's my car (okay)
Catch me on another planet, catch me on another planet
Catch me on another planet, I be up in Mars
I be on another planet
I be on another planet, I be on another planet
(Chris Brown, let's go)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Let's go back to '88, b-b-b-back to '88
Air Jordan 3's, white blacksmith grey
I'm reaching for the stars so you know just how I play
Blasting off like a rocket, N.A.S.A
That time machine that I'm riding got them Lamborghini doors
So why don't you get up in here and pick that date so we can just go?
Ain't no Ferrari faster than what I go (uh-huh)
Ain't no Porche GT cleaner than what I got (zoom)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
1 planet, 2 planet, 3 planet, 4
Zoom past the moon and about 5 more (zoom)
1 planet, 2 planet, 3 planet, 4
What'chu waiting on girl, let's go, go (leggo)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jawan Harris]
I be up in Mars, I be up in Mars (ayy, ayy)
I be so fly, I can touch the stars (ayy, ayy)
I be up in Mars, I be up in Mars (ayy, ayy)
When you see that spaceship, yup, that's my car (okay)
Catch me on another planet, catch me on another planet
Catch me on another planet, I be up in Mars
I be on another planet
I be on another planet, I be on another planet,  I be up in Mars

[Bridge: Jawan Harris & Chris Brown]
Baby, let's go into the stars, we can go farther than Mars
Across the solar system, all through the galaxy
Lace up your Jordans, baby
And ride with me
'Cause I'm hotter than Venus, I'm cooler than colder on Pluto
We can do it bigger than Jupiter, E.T. baby, call home
Earthlings hotter, they like Tarzan
Tell your momma you in love with a martian, oh, woah

[Chorus: Jawan Harris & Chris Brown]
I be up in Mars, I be up in Mars, I be up in Mars (ayy, ayy)
I be so fly, I can touch the stars, so fly
I be up in Mars, I be up in Mars, baby (ayy, ayy)
When you see that spaceship, yup, that's my car (okay)
Catch me on another planet, catch me on another planet, on another planet, baby
Catch me on another planet, I be up in Mars
I be on another planet
I be on another planet, I be on another planet, I be up in Mars
