[Verse 1]
Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better
This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together
This Christmas
The fireside is blazing bright, woah-oh-oh
We're caroling through the night, woah-oh-oh
This Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me
Woah-oh-oh-woah-oh-oh-oh
Ha, let's go (Woo!)

[Verse 2]
Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you
This Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town, they do
This Christmas

[Chorus]
The fireside is blazing bright
And we're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah, huh, woah-oh-oh
Oh, haha, shake a hand, shake a hand now
Na-na-na-na-na-na

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Ooh, the fireside is blazing bright
And we're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
So special for you and me, yes, it will be
Woah-oh-oh, ha
Shake a hand now
Come on, everybody shake a hand now, ha
Family, hey
We'll be together
To make this Christmas bright, yes, we will
