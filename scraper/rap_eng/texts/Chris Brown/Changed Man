[Verse 1]
Daily, I've been waiting for the time
To pass and let it fade in
But baby, my patience is driving me crazy
Making me feel apart

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you do when the truth isn't quite enough?
They looking at you, telling you, "We need to break it up"
You need to trust what you do, it's you and me in love
But I'ma make it up to you and show the world

[Chorus]
I'm a changed man
'Cause you mean much to me
I don't wanna be done
I'm doing all that I can
And everybody hates Chris
They can never understand
So can we love? Can we love?
Can we love? Can we love?
Can we love? Can we love?
Can we love again?
Girl, I know I told you
Baby, this ain't over
This ain't over
It ain't over

[Verse 2]
I remember your touch, God, I miss you so much
Please believe me, baby, I'm sorry
And all of this money and fame can never amount
To every moment when I see your face

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you do when the truth isn't quite enough?
They looking at you, telling you, "We need to break it up"
You need to trust what you do, it's you and me in love
But I'ma make it up to you and show the world

[Chorus]
I'm a changed man
'Cause you mean much to me
I don't wanna be done
I'm doing all that I can
And everybody hates Chris
They can never understand
So can we love? Can we love?
Can we love? Can we love?
Can we love? Can we love?
Can we love again?
Girl, I know I told you
Baby, this ain't over
This ain't over
It ain't over

[Bridge]
Saying I'm sorry doesn't make it alright
I know, I know
But I believe that we can make it if we try, if we try
Yeah, yeah, woah

[Chorus]
I'm a changed man
'Cause you mean much to me
I don't wanna be done
I'm doing all that I can
And everybody hates Chris
They can never understand
So can we love? Can we love?
Can we love? Can we love?
Can we love? Can we love?
Can we love again?
Girl, I know I told you
Baby, this ain't over
This ain't over
It ain't over

[Outro]
It ain't over, oh
It ain't over
It ain't over
