[Verse 1: Joelle James]
Today was the day that you showed me you're stuck in your ways, you ain't changing
Instead the fussing and fighting, you should've been kissing and loving me, baby
I didn't make this fall apart, I showed you every single card
For whatever reason you took it out on me, oh, woah (ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Pre-Chorus: Joelle James]
I ain't with this game shit, made a decision, boy, you gotta live with it
So now, why you're playing these games, games? (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm independent now, I ain't gotta deal with it
Feeling like you're not satisfied, but fuck it at least I tried to satisfy you (no, no, fuck it)

[Chorus: Joelle James]
Baby, I hold down my hand, but I can't reach you (oh)
Don't wanna open my eyes, what's the point if I can't see you?
You got me fading away, you got me fading away
Look what you made

[Verse 2: Joelle James]
Mistakes on mistakes, yeah, you're all bad
But you try to cover it up, I see all that
Right through you, you made of glass
Gave you my love and threw it away
It was good in the past, what you doing today?
See that you're dirty, the mess that you made
Blew up in your face, I'm a grenade
Bang bang, said I'm a fucking grenade

[Pre-Chorus: Joelle James]
I ain't with this game shit, made a decision, boy, you gotta live with it
So now, why you're playing these games, games? (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm independent now, I ain't gotta deal with it
Feeling like you're not satisfied, but fuck it at least I tried to satisfy you (no, no, fuck it)

[Chorus: Joelle James]
Baby, I hold down my hand, but I can't reach you (oh)
Don't wanna open my eyes, what's the point if I can't see you?
You got me fading away, you got me fading away
Look what you made

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Uh, big poppa from my helicopter, need binoculars
Elevator in my crib, Maybach to the Oprah
Versace suit, I'm the truth, see it, need a doctor
But I'm too caught up in this money, I forgot about you
You hate me now, what I did?
A nigga gave you everythin', my car and crib
You say you faded, I could give a fuck
Nigga, what, you givin' up?

[Chorus: Joelle James & (Chris Brown)]
Baby, I hold down my hand, but I can't reach you (oh) (I'm gone)
Don't wanna open my eyes, what's the point if I can't see you? (Yeah)
You got me fading away, you got me fading away (do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I)
Look what you made (yeah)
