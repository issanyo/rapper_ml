[Verse 1]
Only 15 minutes 'til your mama comes home from work and I know
That she would be tickled pink to find me here, yeah
'Cause even though we was just chilling and a little flirting
She don't even want me anywhere near her baby girl, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
So I think I better leave, grab my coat, hat and Timbos
And bounce through the window
'Cause the last song on the CD is skipping
And I don't want your folks catching me, you tripping

[Chorus]
'Cause she don't think we're old enough to fall in love
'Cause she swears that I'm from the wrong side of the tracks
She don't see there's more to me than just a thug
There's nothing you can do when opposites attract and it's like that

[Bridge]
All my ladies in the house tonight, say ooh
Yeah, now if y'all wanna fall in love with Chris, say ooh
All my ladies in the house tonight, say ooh
Aw yeah, that sounds so good, now say woah

[Chorus]
'Cause she don't think we're old enough to fall in love
'Cause she swears that I'm from the wrong side of the tracks
She don't see there's more to me than just a thug
There's nothing you can do when opposites attract and it's like that
