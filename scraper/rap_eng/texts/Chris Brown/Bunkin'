[Intro: Chris Brown]
Where my real bitches at?
100, keep this shit 100, 100

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Yeah, my bitch she bunkin'
She went from nothing now she somthing
My bitch bunkin'
She only clap that ass for me
My bitch bunkin'
I taught her how to whip a ki
Now my trap jumpin'
She bring that dough to me how I want it
In fifties, hundreds, all that
Money is money, my nigga, even small stacks
We on right now, so you may have to wait, my nigga
I throw that cash in the air, this shit feel great, my nigga

[Verse 1: Jay 305]
(I don't know if you know
How it feel to ride out in sunset watching the sunset
California, Los Angeles my nigga
What's happening though? Look)
My bitch grind, my boo now know I'm thugging, I'm from the Slums
She know I'm in the streets, she hold my guns
Ain't seen my P.O. in weeks, fuckin' months
Told her hold my spot down I'm on the run
I got my motherfucking J's on, finna hit Arkansas
Get these OXYs off, come back to L.A., wipe my case
Where I'm from it's bang or ball, fucking bitches like yo misses
Flip 'em like a case of raw, back to to business flipping digits
Splitting switches with my niggas, came from nothing, from nothing to something
Know my struggle, my momma know I'm thugging
Coming out the county jail smell like public, yo momma love it
Got your main bitch on my side on time, nigga

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Yeah, my bitch she bunkin'
She went from nothing now she somthing
My bitch bunkin'
She only clap that ass for me
My bitch bunkin'
I taught her how to whip a ki
Now my trap jumpin'
She bring that dough to me how I want it
In fifties, hundreds, all that
Money is money, my nigga, even small stacks
We on right now, so you may have to wait, my nigga
I throw that cash in the air, this shit feel great, my nigga

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Hey hey, now don't it feel great
When you ride through the hood when you known as Bill Gates?
Yeah, with a super bad bitch in a drop Lamborghini
Make a home girl hate
Just a trap nigga known to have a quarter-mill a day
Nigga, proof that selling drugs on the corner still pay
I make a hundred Gs, spend 40 on Ki's
Put the rest away just in case I caught a real case
Yeah, and I ain't gon' stop
Teaching you the shit that you ain't know 'bout
On my side when I rhyme, think it ain't no Glock
Stop cuffing that bitch like she ain't no thot
Hey, racks on that ass, think it ain't gon' drop?
Even if not, but the brain on fire
Nigga 14 years I remain on fire
Men do, women too but the game don’t lie
Hey, still up to the same old shit
Bang on a pussy nigga they ain't no shit
Stop playing with it pussy you know you don’t want this
Shut the fuck down or yo ass gon’ get it
In public, it’s nothin’
I'm right back in my bunkin’
Ain't what you do it’s how you does it
And we does it cousin

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Yeah, my bitch she bunkin'
She went from nothing now she somthing
My bitch bunkin'
She only clap that ass for me
My bitch bunkin'
I taught her how to whip a ki
Now my trap jumpin'
She bring that dough to me how I want it
In fifties, hundreds, all that
Money is money, my nigga, even small stacks
We on right now, so you may have to wait, my nigga
I throw that cash in the air, this shit feel great, my nigga

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Make me harder, miss your daughter
She just wanna lay and party
Be my naughty girl in college
Fuck you all the time, I'm tired
Wake up on it, it's that
Early morning, tap that wet wet
You know a nigga love breakfast, I'mma bite that
Got money in the mattress where I hide it at
She counting all of that, fuck all of them niggas
They don't know what to do with all that
As a matter fact get on my lap
Put you on the map take you out the trap
From a condo to a larger state
Got double gates
If I catch a case
Would you wait on me and build me up again, if so

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Yeah my niggas thuggin', poppin' rubber bands, money in my hand
Double cuppin' with the Sprite, mix it with Xans
With some zombies here tonight, slow motion, your bitch choosing
She say "Don't they call you Breezy?" I told that bitch "I'm coolin"
With a hunnid million dollars, got a hunnid on my chain
She got a million dollar body with a hundred dollar brain
Girl your booty like a pumpkin, like a pumpkin
And my bitch she be bunkin'

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Yeah, my bitch she bunkin'
She went from nothing now she somthing
My bitch bunkin'
She only clap that ass for me
My bitch bunkin'
I taught her how to whip a ki
Now my trap jumpin'
She bring that dough to me how I want it
In fifties, hundreds, all that
Money is money, my nigga, even small stacks
We on right now, so you may have to wait, my nigga
I throw that cash in the air, this shit feel great, my nigga
