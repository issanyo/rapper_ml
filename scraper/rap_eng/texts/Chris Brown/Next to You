[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Justin Bieber]
You've got that smile that only heaven can make
I'll pray to God everyday that you keep that smile
Yeah, you are my dream, there's not a thing I won't do
I'd give my life up for you 'cause you are my dream

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Justin Bieber]
And baby everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely girl
'Cause you are the only thing that I've got right now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
One day when the sky is falling, I'll be standing
Right next to you, right next to you
Nothing will ever come between us 'cause I'll be standing
Right next to you, right next to you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Justin Bieber]
If you had my child
You would make my life complete
Just to have your eyes on little me
That be mine forever

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Justin Bieber]
And baby everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely girl
'Cause you are the only thing that I've got right now

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Justin Bieber]
One day when the sky is falling, I'll be standing
Right next to you, right next to you
Nothing will ever come between us, I'll be standing
Right next to you, right next to you

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Justin Bieber]
We're made for one another, me and you
And I have no fear, I know we'll make it through
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you, woah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Justin Bieber]
One day when the sky is falling, I'll be standing
Right next to you, right next to you
Nothing will ever come between us, I'll be standing
Right next to you, right next to you

[Outro: Chris Brown & Justin Bieber]
Oh yeah, stand by my side, side, side
When the sky falls down
I'll be there, I'll be there
You've got that smile that only heaven can make
I pray to God everyday to keep you forever
