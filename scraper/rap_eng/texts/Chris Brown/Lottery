[Verse 1]
If I gotta guess it I will
I think it's 310-143-1437
Baby if I press it then will I get to you?
Let me know, what is your number girl?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every minute is worth a dime of spending
You can change my whole life if you fit it
Odds are one in a billion
My heart, I bet on you if I just get your number

[Chorus]
Girl if I put your number in my phone, I hope that it's the right one
Girl If I did then I'm gon' win it tonight hon
It could mean a lot for me, I think I done hit the lottery
Baby yeah, think I hit the lottery, baby yeah

[Verse 2]
Get on this investment cause if you bet on me
Then we can go anywhere in love, it's nothing
If I leave a message I hope that it goes through
Let me know, if I'm the one girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Every minute is worth a dime of spending
You can change my whole life if you fit it
Odds are one in a billion
My heart, I bet on you if I just get your number

[Chorus]
Girl if I put your number in my phone, I hope that it's the right one
Girl If I did then I'm gon' win it tonight hon
It could mean a lot for me, I think I done hit the lottery
Baby yeah, think I hit the lottery, baby yeah, think I hit the lottery

[Bridge]
If you choose me, girl I promise, if you choose, I'll be honest
If you choose me, won't abuse it, if you choose me
And if you choose me, if you choose me
And if you, if you choose me and if you choose, I'mma love you

[Chorus]
Girl if I put your number in my phone, I hope that it's the right one
Girl If I did then I'm gon' win it tonight hon

Baby yeah, think I hit the lottery, baby yeah
