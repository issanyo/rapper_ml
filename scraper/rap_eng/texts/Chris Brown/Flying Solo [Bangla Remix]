[Verse 1]
Departure time, 7:30, I'm packed and ready to go
First class ticket outta here
I think it's time to put it back in gear
No more standing by, I'm tryna stay clear, oh
Turbulence got me nervous, I should have never flown
Scared when you fly alone again
You know the atmosphere wasn't perfect
I'm thinking to myself was it worth it?

[Pre-Chorus]
Layover's almost over, I can see clearly, no more stormy weather
Exit row, don't pull on the lever, lever
This gon' be my final destination
No more sitting round having my time wasted
You say it's now or never, I pick never
We can be together, so calm down
No more red eye, late nights
I'm one way, no more connected flights, when

[Chorus]
When we stared out, knew this relationship was unhealthy
You broke the code, never thought that you would stoop so low
You got me flying solo
Now you crying, talking 'bout you can't live without me, yeah
My heart is sold, shoulda never, ever left me this cold
You got me flying solo

[Bridge]
Bujhi na keno ami betha onubhub kori tumi chhara
Tomar amar onubhuti bhanga, tai keno amar mon kharap
Jaano, ekhon akashe urechhi, chinta chhara
Smriti guli hariye gechhi, bhulechhi tomay, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Layover's almost over, I can see clearly, no more stormy weather
Exit row, don't pull on the lever, lever
This gon' be my final destination
No more sitting round having my time wasted
You say it's now or never, I pick never
We can be together, so calm down
No more red eye, late nights
I'm one way, no more connected flights, when

[Chorus]
When we stared out, knew this relationship was unhealthy
You broke the code, never thought that you would stoop so low
You got me flying solo
Now you crying, talking 'bout you can't live without me, yeah
My heart is sold, shoulda never, ever left me this cold
You got me flying solo
Solo solo solo, solo solo solo
Solo solo solo
You got me flying, you got me flying solo
Solo solo solo, solo solo solo
Solo solo solo
You got me flying, you got me flying solo
