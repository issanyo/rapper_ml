[Intro: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
Nappy Boy, hey, with Pretty Boy, oh-oh
Hey, Nappy Boy, hey with Pretty Boy, oh-oh

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Turn up the bass, turn up the treble
I'm 'bout to take you to a whole other level (oh, oh-oh-oh)
DJ, turn off what you're playing (playing, playing)
I want the whole club to hear what I'm saying (saying, saying)
Because this girl means so much to me
And now we're on the floor and she touching me
And if I wanna take her home
It's gonna be better than what they do on the radio

[Chorus: T-Pain & Chris Brown]
It's gotta be the crunkest, it's gotta be the loudest
It's gotta be the best, the best love song she ever heard in her life
I gotta tell her how I feel (feel)
I gotta let her hear, the best love song she ever heard in her life
No need for me to write it (me to write it)
I just gotta picture her smiling
And if you feel that way (way), go ahead and kiss your baby
Now we've got the whole stadium in love like
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Turn on the lights (lights), give me a mic (mic)
I'm 'bout to sing it to it just how she likes (li-li-likes)
Jump off the stage, oh, bombs away
Crowd surfing all the way, (ayy) cowabunga
You know it's right (right), just do the wave (do the wave)
Girl, just move your body like a snake (ma)
And if you wanna get with me
Put your hands in the air, show me that energy

[Chorus: T-Pain & Chris Brown]
It's gotta be the crunkest, it's gotta be the loudest (hey)
It's gotta be the best, the best love song she ever heard in her life (oh)
I gotta tell her how I feel (feel)
I gotta let her hear, the best love song she ever heard in her life
No need for me to write it (me to write it)
I just gotta picture her smiling
And if you feel that way (way), go ahead and kiss your baby
Now we've got the whole stadium in love like
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (we got love)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (oh, we got love)

[Bridge: T-Pain & Chris Brown]
Homie kiss your girl, shorty, kiss your man
We can see you on the kissing cam
Now show me some love (hey, yeah)
Show me some love (hey, yeah)
Now look her in the eye (eye), say, "Baby, I love you," (I love you)
"I never put no one above you"

[Chorus: T-Pain & Chris Brown]
And if you feel that way (way), go ahead and kiss your baby
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (got love)
And if you feel that way (way), go ahead and kiss your baby
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (oh, oh, oh, baby)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (in love, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
