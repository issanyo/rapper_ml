[Verse 1]
I hope you know just how I feel, girl, I ain't running game
But there's a couple things I'd like to try to explain

[Pre-Chorus]
You say you wanna wait a while
Girl, I ain't mad at you, in fact I like your style
'Cause it's more than just a physical attraction that I'm feeling
It's real, ooh and baby, here's the deal

[Chorus]
I'll be right here
'Til the sun and the moon and the stars, they all refuse to shine
I'll be right here
I wanna be the thoughts that you think, whatever is on your mind
I'll be right here
Girl, I wanna be a part of you, just like the air you breathe
And you can count on me

[Verse 2]
You don't have to be afraid to say what's on your mind
Your body language's telling me, let's take our time

[Pre-Chorus]
You say you wanna wait a while
Girl, I ain't mad at you, in fact I like your style
'Cause it's more than just a physical attraction that I'm feeling
It's real, ooh and baby, here's the deal

[Chorus]
I'll be right here
'Til the sun and the moon and the stars, they all refuse to shine
I'll be right here
I wanna be the thoughts that you think, whatever is on your mind
I'll be right here
Girl, I wanna be a part of you, just like the air you breathe
And you can count on me, yeah

[Bridge]
Don't you doubt our love, don't you doubt our love
You're the only one, you're the only one I'm thinking of
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Baby, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Girl, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Uh, oh no
Oh no no no no no
Ain't going nowhere
Baby, I'll be right here
Uh huh
Ain't going nowhere
Baby

[Chorus]
I'll be right here
'Til the sun and the moon and the stars, they all refuse to shine
I'll be right here
I wanna be the thoughts that you think, whatever is on your mind
I'll be right here
Girl, I wanna be a part of you, just like the air you breathe
And you can count on me, baby
I'll be right here, I'll be right here
I'll be right here
I'll be right here
I'll be right here
