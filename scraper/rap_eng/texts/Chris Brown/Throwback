[Intro: B.o.B]
Ay, go crazy to this, go crazy to this
Go crazy to this, all my bitches get together and go crazy to this
Go crazy to this, go crazy to this
Go crazy to this, all my bitches get together, go crazy

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
And throw that back, throw that back, don't be scared, bitch, throw that back
This dick right here is cleaner than a hypochondriac
Po' that yack, po' that yack, this flow, you know that's crack
This beat, you know that crack, I put my city on, yeah, we're on the map
Two hands when she's on, like a scooter, she told me she wish she knew me sooner
If I hit her with the new maneuver, what's she gon' do? Scream "Hallelujah"
Her eyes rollin', she's gone, she gettin' into her zone
And when she gives me that look then I'ma do whatever I want

[Hook: B.o.B]
Go crazy to this, go crazy to this
Go crazy to this, all my bitches get together, go crazy to this
Go crazy to this, go crazy to this
Go crazy to this, all my bitches get together
Go crazy and throw that back, throw that back
Don't play bitch, throw that back
Throw that back, throw that back
Don't play bitch, throw that back
Throw that back, throw that back
Ba-ba-ba, throw that back
Throw that back, throw that back
Don't play girl, throw that back

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Look don't play with it, I'ma lay in it, I'ma paint your walls, I'ma spray in it
And if I go "licky-licky," put my face in it, if this country wood, then you takin' it
I said my chain's so bright, I'm vacationin' and you fake ass niggas ain't made of shit
I got 150 racks, just to show up, you had to pay? Nigga, I got paid to sit
I bet your girl know me, a young nigga but I'm feelin' like a OG, add an R and a Y, that's an orgy
I've got her legs in the sky, she's gon' walk a bunch of life with both feet
She said her booty from the Motherland, she started wobblin' and poppin' it, like a rubber band
I'm throwin' 10 racks with my right, she told me grab her ass with my other hand

[Hook: B.o.B]
Go crazy to this, go crazy to this
Go crazy to this, all my bitches get together, go crazy to this
Go crazy to this, go crazy to this
Go crazy to this, all my bitches get together
Go crazy and throw that back, throw that back
Don't play bitch, throw that back
Throw that back, throw that back
Don't play bitch, throw that back
Throw that back, throw that back
Ba-ba-ba, throw that back
Throw that back, throw that back
Don't play girl, throw that back

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
I'm a pimp, did you know that? Bobby Ray's finna throw that
And when I throw that D I never hold back, hoes lookin' for me like a lo-jack
'Cause she wanna ride it like she stole it, that camel toe, I'm finna poke it
She got her best friend with her and we playin' hokey-pokey
She trying to focus on this wood and this pine, bow down to the wood, like a shrine
I be the 6, you be the 9, that's the only time you'll be less than a dime
Girl, it's yoga time, time to stretch, time to wind, I wanna see you wind, I want to put it on your mind when I see you grind
Give life to the dead, give sight to the blind, I'ma hit it from the back like "Aah, aah, aah"

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Look, go crazy to this, go crazy to this
Now I'm layin' the pipe 'cause you ain't fuckin' her right, a nigga lazy as shit
They go crazy to this, make her go crazy to this
Soon as that song drop, that thong drop, just shake that

[Hook: B.o.B]
Throw that back, throw that back
Don't play bitch, throw that back
Throw that back, throw that back
Ba-ba-ba, throw that back
Throw that back, throw that back
Don't play girl, throw that back
