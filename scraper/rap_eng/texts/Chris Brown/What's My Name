[Intro: Noah]
Yeah, I'd like to introduce to you the future, the young, the new R&B prince Chris Brown
Chris spit flame and me stick around ya boy Chris Brown

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Have you ever seen a 4 door machine when them things swing open? Girl picture that
Have you ever travelled upon a yacht, sail across the ocean? Girl picture that
Tell me have you ever seen the stars shoot across the night sky from a G4 side
Can you picture it? Matter fact picture you and me livnig it

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I know I'm just a young'n but girl I'm in a good groove, right zone, I just need a year or two
Let me stack this paper, I'mma keep the lights on, let me show you what a hit single can do
And we can act a fool with it, so much diamond you won't know what to do with it
What's my name? The name Chris Brown from Virginia, ask about me and they'll tell you I'm the truth with it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
C to the H to the RIS
I know you like it mama just say yes
And if you didn't know now you know
I'm a pro and I can go on and on and on and on
C to the H to the RIS
I know you like it baby just say yes
And if you didn't know now you know
I'm a pro and I can go on and on and on and on

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I know I might sound a little out there but the south of France, I'm tryna keep you out there girl
Take my hand and we can walk up out there with, brand new bags, now tell me how does that sound girl?
It's crazy how I'm feeling you, damn I gotta get you to see, love
Girl ya style is so sensual, slide ya number and just roll with me

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I know I'm just a young'n but girl I'm in a good groove, right zone, I just need a year or two
Let me stack this paper, I'mma keep the lights on, let me show you what a hit single can do
And we can act a fool with it, so much diamond you won't know what to do with it
What's my name? The name Chris Brown from Virginia, ask about me and they'll tell you I'm the truth with it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
C to the H to the RIS
I know you like it mama just say yes
And if you didn't know now you know

C to the H to the RIS
I know you like it baby just say yes
And if you didn't know now you know
I'm a pro and I can go on and on and on and on

[Verse 3: Noah]
Yo, I see money, money, money everywhere I go
Baby I'mma cash boy, so where my dough? Ka-ching
Girl I know when you hear my flow
Plus all the honies love me when I wear my fro
Lil mama, I'm Noah the charmer
Better known as that boy Chevy Impala
Shawty we can creep while you in ya pyjamas
Then we can sip margaritas in the Bahamas
Amiga, amiga, let's flee to Aruba
We can ride now, I got the keys to the cruiser
You can be with me, ain't gotta be with a loser
Do what it do let me see if I'm a loser, what's my name?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
C to the H to the RIS
I know you like it mama just say yes
And if you didn't know now you know
I'm a pro and I can go on and on and on and on
C to the H to the RIS
I know you like it baby just say yes
And if you didn't know now you know
I'm a pro and I can go on and on and on and on

[Outro: Chris Brown]
It's Chris Brown, ma you need to stop playing
You know who you want, you know what you need and I do too
