[Verse 1: Rob Allen]
When I don't have the words
You say the thing I need to hear
You turn my heart away from fear
All I can do, depends on if, I know that you are here

[Pre-Chorus: Rob Allen]
When you talk you bring me life (give it to me)
When you talk you bring me life (give it to me)
When you talk you bring me life, ah ah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Rob Allen]
Playback in my mind
Cause I feel I'm just playing my life in rewind
You been a part of my life, and truthfully I love you
Nothing can take me away from you
It's your spirit, I can feel it
You're what guides me to find my way
It's your spirit, it's your spirit
I understand now I have a chance now

[Verse 2: Rob Allen]
I never am alone
There is your presence that surrounds me
I can't see myself
Trying to go on without you

[Pre-Chorus: Rob Allen]
When you talk you give me life (give it to me)
When you talk you give me life (give it to me)
When you talk you give me life, ah ah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Rob Allen]
Playback in my mind
Cause I feel I'm just playing my life in rewind
You been a part of my life, and truthfully I love you
Nothing can take me away from you
It's your spirit, I can feel it
You're what guides me to find my way
It's your spirit, it's your spirit
I understand now I have a chance now

[Bridge: Rob Allen]
If I close my eyes, there's no emptiness
Even when they're closed, I see you

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Rob Allen]
Playback in my mind
Cause I feel I'm just playing my life in rewind
You been a part of my life, and truthfully I love you
Nothing can take me away from you
It's your spirit, I can feel it
You're what guides me to find my way
It's your spirit, it's your spirit
I understand now I have a chance now
