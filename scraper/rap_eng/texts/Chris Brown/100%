[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
Beats I be servin', Saks Fifth splurgin'
Diamonds got so many cuts, call my jeweller the surgeon
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, label me the virgin
I'm hot burnin', like when you leave a perm in
Everywhere I go these hoes be diggin' in they purses for a Sharpie
'Cause they tryna get the autograph in cursive
Little bit of Coke mixed with a lot of bourbon
Got your boy leanin', sorry if my words slurrin'
Swervin' in that DB9 on purpose
The roof disappear, call it magic like Earvin Johnson
Get up off my johnson, no more ridin' dick
Shawty, this ain't magic mountain
I've been killin', killin' every song that I been spittin' on
And if I ain't spittin', better somethin' that I written on
Can't even say it was a long road gettin' on
Only took a year and a half and now I'm shittin' on 'em

[Hook: Kevin McCall]
Get it how I live it, come faster than I could spend it
Money to the ceilin', bitch, I'm in the buildin'
I'm a giant in the room full of midgets, tell 'em
Money talks so don't say nothin' unless you talkin' business
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go

[Interlude: Kevin McCall]
Lemme count this money, one million, two million
Put this up for my new car, save that for my baby momma and all you bums can keep the change

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Yeah, I got them bullet proof Ray Bans so haters never in my head
Money hungry good for me, yeah, I call it wheat bread
Ladies say I'm long strokin', yeah, thatâ€™s what she said
Crib like a castle so I'm fuckin' on that king spread
Haha, big ballin', fuck a loft
And money turn me on so I had to fuck it off
Skinny ass nigga's pockets lookin' so bulimic
And I never spill my drink, you can call me Tempur-Pedic
Allergic to the haters, addicted to the money
You askin' why I'm laughin' 'cause all of you niggas funny
And they call me Action Jackson 'cause every day I'm stuntin'
And I'm writin' hit songs like it's nothin'
So nigga, you buggin', frontin', what you think this is hoe?
Paparazzi tryna pop me everywhere that Chris go
Never been no sucker no lame, mad nigga
And your flow is more watered down than a drain, ass nigga

[Hook: Kevin McCall]
Get it how I live it, come faster than I could spend it
Money to the ceilin', bitch, I'm in the buildin'
I'm a giant in the room full of midgets, tell 'em
Money talks so don't say nothin' unless you talkin' business
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go
