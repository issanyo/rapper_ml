[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I need your touch, but your hands are locked away
I hear your voice, you've got nothing left to say
I'll take this scar off my heart
I'll take this bullet, I'll take it for love

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
So if the lights in the sky come crashing down
I still can find your love even in the crowd but will you remember me?

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
Will you remember my name? Remember my name
Will you remember my name? Remember my name
I love you, I love you, I love you
Remember my, I love you, I love you, love you
Remember my name, I love you, I love you, love you
Remember my, I love you, I love you, I love you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I need your kiss but your lips are far away
So I have no choice, so I guess I'll have to steal your love away
And I'll take this scar from my heart bang bang, I take this bullet, bang bang, I take it for love
Bang bang, I take it for love, bang bang, Iâ€™ll take it for love

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
Will you remember my name? Remember my name
Will you remember my name? Remember my name
I love you, I love you, I love you
Remember my, I love you, I love you, love you
Remember my name, I love you, I love you, love you
Remember my, I love you, I love you, I love you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
Floating above the clouds and sky, wishing upon a falling star
Hoping my love hasn't forgot my name
Its automatic this attraction, this love is so strong
Two birds up above me baby wishing we could float off
And we can fly higher babe, higher babe, higher babe, higher babe, higher babe
Just fly higher babe, higher babe, higher babe, higher babe
All gas, no breaks I just wanna levitate, all gas, no breaks I just wanna levitate
All gas, no breaks I just wanna levitate, we just wanna levitate, we just wanna levitate

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
Will you remember my name? Remember my name
Will you remember my name? Remember my name
Remember my, remember my name
Remember my, remember my name
