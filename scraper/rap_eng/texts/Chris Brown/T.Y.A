[Verse 1]
Girl you need to get your money back
You've been had, I hope you got a warranty
Cause I been walking 'round with money bags
In my bag shorty gonna roll with me
Girl you need to get your money back
You've been had, I hope you got a warranty
Cause I been walking 'round with money bags
In my bag shorty gonna roll with me
Go slow promise I can make you beg for more
Put that thing on repeat
So holla holla if you with me
Got dollar dollars if you with me, yeah

[Pre-Chrous]
Imagine taking trips to Paris, anything that you want girl I'll get it
You got a banging body anything you wear is sexy baby, lady
Oooh, I wanna kiss you between your thighs
And when I'm licking and I'm touching super bad McLovin, time to go night night bed time

[Chorus]
Make your hands touch your ankles, hands touch your ankles
Hands touch your ankles, hands touch your
Hands touch your ankles, hands touch your ankles
Hands touch your, hands touch your
Make it clap for me
Hands touch your ankles, hands touch your ankles
Hands touch your ankles, hands
Hands touch your ankles, hands touch your ankles, ankles

[Pre-Chrous]
Imagine taking trips to Paris, anything that you want girl I'll get it
You got a banging body anything you wear is sexy baby, lady
Oooh, I wanna kiss you between your thighs
And when I'm licking and I'm touching super bad McLovin, time to go night night bed time

[Chorus]
Make your hands touch your ankles, hands touch your ankles

Coolest nigga in this spot that's why they call me Breezy

[Chorus]
Make your hands touch your ankles, hands touch your ankles
Hands touch your ankles, hands touch your
Hands touch your ankles, hands touch your ankles
Hands touch your, hands touch your

Hands touch your ankles, hands touch your ankles
Hands touch your ankles, hands
Hands touch your ankles, hands touch your ankles, ankles
