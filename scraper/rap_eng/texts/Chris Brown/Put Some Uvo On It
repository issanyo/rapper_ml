[Intro]
Word!
It makes everything better
New Uvo!
Yeah, yeah, yeah (you know)

[Chorus]
Put some Uvo on it (Uvo)
Oh, need some Uvo on it (yeah, yeah)
Oh, put some Uvo on it (Uvo)
Oh, put some Uvo on it

[Verse]
Drink it straight with no chaser
Liquor got the party lit
She like the way that it's makin' her feel
You wanna get faded? Girl, come over here

[Chorus]
Put some Uvo on it, yeah (Uvo)
Put some Uvo on it (Uvo)
Oh, put some Uvo on it (Uvo)
It's that Uvo (Uvo)
Yeah, put some Uvo on it
I know what you need, baby, yeah
Put some Uvo on it
