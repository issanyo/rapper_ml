[Verse 1]
I wish I could forget you, wouldn't that be nice?
But I'm reminded of the wrongs we couldn't right
Girl, say your peace, girl, wish you'd a been right
I'm going left, I'm tryna pick me up, hey, girl it's like it is a chase, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh girl, you've been giving me hell
You know, you said it yourself
That I would find no other love, now here I am
Baby, if I could get you, up out my head, maybe for a second now, oh woah

[Chorus]
Oh, I just can't get over you
Chasing my tail like a fool
You got me going right around, right around, right around (ooh, ooh)
Chasing down your love, oh, oh, around I'm going nowhere

[Verse 2]
Damn, too important to forget you and it's hard not to miss you
'Cause all I see is flashbacks in my bed, pillow cases, traces of your smell
This thing's going nowhere, you said you needed space but now the coast's clear
Oh, we could have had this so good, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you've been givin' me hell
You know, you said it yourself (yourself)
That I would find no other love, now here I am (and I get further, oh)
Baby, if I could get you, up out my head, maybe for a second now, oh woah (oh)

[Chorus]
Oh, I just can't get over you (you, oh no, no, no)
Chasing my tail like a fool
Girl, you got me going right around, right around, right around (ooh, ooh)
Chasing down your love, oh, oh, around I'm going nowhere

[Bridge]
Right around, right around, right around
Chasing down your love, oh, oh, around I'm going nowhere
Baby, if I could get you, up out my head
Maybe for a second now, oh woah

[Chorus]
Oh, I just can't get over you
Chasing my tail like a fool
Girl, you got me going right around, right around, right around (ooh, ooh)
Chasing down your love, oh, oh, around I'm going nowhere
