[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You leaving with me
Girl, I know you got a man though
And you know I got a girl so
Let's get up of the club
Don't none of that matter tonight
You leaving with me
Valet grab the Benzo
Girl, please let your friends know
But don't none of that matter tonight

[Verse: T.I]
Girl, right, I know what the girls like
Heart right and big bank will change your life, that's it for life
Got a man, well he ain't tonight
And something tells me your man ain't laying it right
So here we go, take a shot of this to make sure your mind open
Smoke this, it's hard to focus and keep your eyes open
Infatuation a waste of my time and your emotion
You been with them suckers too long, time for a promotion
When there's a strong attraction, my huge advantages
What she don't do in the van, she'll do in the mansion
Just imagine, me and you and a moment of passion
Overlooking the city on a circular mattress
Know that ass too nice just to be used for dancing
Tell me how could something so sweet be so nasty
And baby,I don't mean no harm, I'm just asking
Got ya hands in my pants with my belt unfastened, so I guess that means

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You leaving with me
Girl, I know you got a man though
And you know I got a girl so
Let's get up of the club
Don't none of that matter tonight
You leaving with me
Valet grab the Benzo
Girl, please let your friends know
But don't none of that matter tonight
