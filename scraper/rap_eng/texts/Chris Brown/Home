[Intro]
I wanna go back, I wanna go back to my home
I just wanna go back

[Verse 1]
I say, is this life, is this my time to waste?
I got all this money calling me, how the fuck I'ma turn it down?
And I done fucked around and bought too many cars now, baby, I guess that I'm a superstar now
But I wish that I could go back 'cause that money don't mean a thing when everybody changing

[Chorus]
Praying with they hands out
What the fuck you want from me?
I got all my niggas in here
So don't play with me, fuck a one-on-one
I don't wanna do it, wish I could go back to when I was young
Wish I could go back, go back, go back from where I came from
Yeah and if I knew then what I knew now
I would change some

[Verse 2]
Crab niggas don’t know niggas, been here like a old nigga
When your girl see me she say, "Breezy you a cold nigga"
Motherfuck the club, tired of fake hoes and gold diggers
And while he tryna cuff your ass, let go, nigga
In 1999, most of y’all didn't know me
Tryna call me brodi, nigga, you ain't my homie
I'm tryna cash out everybody I came up with
But these cameras steady on that fuck shit

[Chorus]
Praying with they hands out
What the fuck you want from me?
I got all my niggas in here
So don't play with me, fuck a one-on-one
I don't wanna do it, wish I could go back to when I was young
Wish I could go back, go back, go back from where I came from
Yeah and if I knew then what I knew now
I would change some

[Bridge]
I just wanna go back to freedom, just take away all the bullshit and rewind the truth
Now everyday they want to say shit, that’s when I say fuck you
I'm no super fly no laces, I could give a fuck about you
That's when they hit me with that same old

[Chorus]
Praying with they hands out
What the fuck you want from me?
I got all my niggas in here
So don't play with me, fuck a one-on-one
I don't wanna do it, wish I could go back to when I was young
Wish I could go back, go back, go back from where I came from
Yeah and if I knew then what I knew now
I would change some
