[Verse 1: Ester Dean]
Oh, I guess I'm a bad, bad man, yeah
And I ain't no good for you
Tell me where you'll find a better man, yeah
Who's gonna treat you better then I do?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
'Cause I ain't tripping in the club
I giving him no love
All them thotties tryna fuck with me
I ain't tripping for nobody else
Asking of nobody else

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ester Dean]
Girl, it's all in your head
It's all in your head
Oh girl, it's all in your head
Oh girl

[Post-Chrous: Ester Dean]
And everytime I go out
You claim I'm with every girl
And looking at every girl
Think I'm smashing every girl
Can't be fucking every girl, oh
It's all in your head

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
If I gotta be the bad man
Then at least you gotta tell me why
Girl, what the hell is up with you?
You checking through my phone and shit, oh nah, hell no

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain't tripping in the club
I giving him no love
All them thotties tryna fuck with me
I ain't tripping for nobody else
Asking of nobody else

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ester Dean]
