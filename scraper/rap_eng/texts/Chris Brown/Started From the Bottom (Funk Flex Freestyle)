[Intro]
Haha, that's where we at?
Okay, look

[Verse 1]
Black Benz, European, give a fuck about this paper
Say your girl is a fan? Now that bitch up at my table
Every day the same cycle, got the weed, got the liquor
Got the swishas and these bitches, we gon' pull an all nighter
Doin' this shit for VA, 200 on the freeway
They blowin' up my phone 'cause they tryna get a three-way
This shit lookin' like a relay, she already chose
'Cause there's too many niggas with you, not enough hoes
God damnit, I know you can't stand it, while I just command it
I do damage if she pull her panties down to the floor
She let me cut like I need a bandage, I'm a pussy bandit
If your nigga trippin' 40 on me, tell me when to go
I put 500 thousand on you, why you rent it for?
If that shit is yours, then what's it tinted for?
Throw that Westside up with them Lamborghini doors
And I step right up, I make it rain, I make it pour, ha
Who a low life? Nigga, get it straight
All this ice, in your face
All this money, I don't need to save
How you talkin' money to a fuckin' bank?
Now throw a couple bands on it
Walk the plank, walk the plank, yeah, stand on it
That's your bitch? I'm sorry, she put her hands on it
I know you hate it, but you know you a fan, homie
Okay, I love them Asians, I love them red dots
She give me brain, what I call a head shot
Them white girls say they love 2Pac
It's hella black bitches all up on this white yacht
Yeah, because it's snapbacks and tattoos
Girl, take them tights off, gon' let that ass loose
This a tax write off, you know I'm that dude
And my flow is 'eughhh' like that pink thing on that baboon
Shitted, my niggas with me ridin' for my city
Got Virginia on my back, my autograph across her titty
Pop that pussy like I pop a wheelie, OHB, I committed
On the dick actin' silly, gon' girl, get it, get it
Fuck bein' low-key, I be on that loud pack
All this smoke up in the air, can't see where the crowd at
Thinkin' you gon' drink for free? Bitch, I can't I allow that
Real nigga section, bitch, you are around that, alright
