[Verse 1]
I dug a single seed into the ground
I hope it grows, grows
In a year or two if you're around
You'll see a rose, rose

[Verse 2]
Pack me up and keep me hidden somewhere
That you can find me
On this train to Paris going nowhere
Draw the bridge behind me

[Chorus]
Don't be gone too long
'Cause you won't be there to love me
When you're gone
Don't be gone too long
'Cause tell me who's gonna love me
When you're gone
Oh yeah, when you're, when you're gone
Oh yeah, yeah, when you're gone

[Verse 3]
Golden leaves are dancing on the ground
It's getting cold, cold
Safe from time, we'll be forever young
Never old, old

[Verse 4]
See upon a ball of fire out in space
Zooming up behind me
All the wondering on your face
Was there inside me

[Chorus]
Don't be gone too long
'Cause you won't be there to love me
When you're gone
Don't be gone too long
Tell me who's gonna love me
When you're gone
Oh, oh, when you're, when you're gone
Oh, oh, when you're gone

[Bridge]
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
(Bring it back to me)
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me

[Chorus]
Don't be gone too long
'Cause you won't be there to love me
When you're gone
Don't be gone too long
Tell me who's gonna love me
When you're gone

Don't be gone too long
(Don't be gone too long)
'Cause you won't be there to love me
When you're gone
(When you're gone)
Don't be gone too long (when you're gone)
'Cause tell me who's gonna love me
When you're gone
