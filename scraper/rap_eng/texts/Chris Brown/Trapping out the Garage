I used to trap out the garage
Talkin' ounces, had bricks
Mr. Get 'em in and move 'em out quick
I used to trap out the garage
Used to get 'em by the bail
100 packs, I ain't even need a scale
I used to trap out the garage
Hustle man get the work, hustle man get the cash
Take a brick and make it skrt, that's the fork hittin' glass
Used to order from the plug, hop out in a mask
Put it all in a bag
I used to trap out the garage

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
These niggas all fake, these niggas all snitch
Same nigga in them DMs tryna fuck with your bitch
Nigga money makin' Mitch, fast money, make it quick
50,000 on your head, let's see how fast they forget
Fuck is you lookin' at with your lookin' ass? Cause we flexin'
Not even Google Maps get you over here to this section
All of my niggas equipped with them cha-cha-cha, I'm protected
Make a move on my chain my nigga, coca taking your nigga

Yo soy el que sale a la esquina

No soy el que tiene receta pero te cocina

Cadena que miran, que brillan
Tu sabe' nosotro' no tenemo' tiempo pa' pagar taquilla

Si explota te estalla bocinas
Tu jefa se pone pa' mí
Me gusta pa' tí
La mando a la esquina

Que traiga los [?]
Que pague la cuenta
Que [?] domina
El rey de la esquina

[Verse 3: Young Lo]
Sorry nigga, I don't speak much, when it's beef, niggas get touched
My young niggas shootin' shit Curry but they more like Horry in the clutch
It all started with a quarter, turned that to a Porsche now them Lamb' doors are up
Kinda hard to find a room in the crib like a fortress and them Xans catching up
Used to trap out the garage, sell packs to the stars
Was the man with the Act' and a plug for the bars
Had the MDMA 'fore they knew what it was
Man they kill 'em off of X, I'm a one stop plug
Young legend with the mud
Outlet and the plug
So when they ask me how I got it
