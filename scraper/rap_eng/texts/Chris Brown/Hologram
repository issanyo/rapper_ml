[Verse 1: Andre Merritt & Chris Brown]
I gotta make my way through all of these people
I didn't pay all this money just so I can see ya
I'm 'bout to act dog on fool
I'm just a dog on you
I'm about to bom bom chicky bump bump on you
Run it back, [glitches]
And I got technology, X-ray vision, any game, I can see through
I get static every time you speak, frequency gotta be equal
I'm tired of playing, can't even hear the shit you saying
'Cause it's like roun roun roun roun roun roun roun

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Andre Merritt]
Hologram
I'm pushing up close but it's hard to get to ya
Hologram
There's a glitch in the system, tell me what I gotta do now
Oh damn
Allusion, confusion, I'm losing ground
Hologram, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hologram, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hologram, hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, hologram

[Verse 2: Andre Merritt & Chris Brown
You want me to flip the switch on so I I can be your victim
I ain't gonna slip up like going outside in the rain with no umbrella
What the hell do you take me for?
I'ma take a different rout
I'm about to bom bom chicky bump bump on you
Run it back, [glitches]
Bang bang choo choo train, baby, put that thing on me
You 'bout to see my main frame out the cage
You 'bout to see another side of me, the city life
T minus 7 before my system shuts down
Matter of fact, I think I'm 'bout to shut it down right now

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Andre Merritt]
Hologram
I'm pushing up close but it's hard to get to ya
Hologram
There's a glitch in the system, tell me what I gotta do now
Oh damn
Allusion, confusion, I'm losing ground
Hologram, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hologram, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hologram, hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, hologramh oh
Hologram

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
I'm tired of playing with you, right now I think your time's up
Giving mixed signals that I don't have control of
I'm losing my mind, perfect model before my time
Download to my instant data, give me a socket, I can plug in now

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Andre Merritt]
Hologram
I'm pushing up close but it's hard to get to ya
Hologram
There's a glitch in the system, tell me what I gotta do now
Oh damn
Allusion, confusion, I'm losing ground
Hologram, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hologram, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hologram, hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, hologram
