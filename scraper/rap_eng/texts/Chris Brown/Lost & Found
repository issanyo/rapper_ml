[Intro]
Ooh woah

[Verse 1]
Tired of the conversations, questions 'bout me
Every time I leave the house, when I'm in or when I'm out
Girlfriend say I treat you foul but I don't know
At the end of the day, you know yourself
And I'm tired of the times when you run your mouth
Time's only running out, baby, you made me take a vow
Stop your whining, and sum it up, what are we now?
At the end of the day, you know yourself
Can't hear when you're talking loud
Oh, you do the most, this shit's getting old, we both said enough
Went through this more than once, but my GPS broke
Don't know where to go

[Chorus]
Every time I'm lost and found
Yeah, this is not the lost and found
Whose time are you wasting now?
'Cause every time I'm lost and found, yeah
Oh, tell me who's losing out
'Cause you say it's the end and playing games again, I found (I found)
Playing games again, I found, yeah
Playing games again, I found yeah

[Verse 2]
Baby, you were the one that I could trust the most, used to think you were beautiful
'Til you would drink too many toasts, what would your mama say if
Girl, you're drunk out your mind, oh my God, get to praying
Taking bread with the wine, rude awakening
Lord don't save her, she think she a big girl
Think she gon' draft all the players, think she gon' be ballin' yeah
But no, no, no, no, I done worked too hard for these cars and this cash no, no, no, no
Selling your soul, might as well be selling your ass, no, no, no, stop kidding, girl, you know yourself

[Chorus]
Every time I'm lost and found
Yeah, this is not the lost and found
Whose time are you wasting now?
'Cause every time I'm lost and found, yeah
Oh, tell me who's losing out
'Cause you say it's the end and playing games again, I found

[Verse 3]
I don't know why you keep fuckin' with niggas
That really don't be in the streets
Always actin' hard like they murderers
Tell them niggas just run into me
This ain't the lost and found, girl, you're out of bounds
It take a lot of money to make her booty bounce
If you takin' shots, better make it count
And girl, don't do nothing for free
I see that shawty want that money bad
She fuckin' all over the internet
Dollars, where the money at?
Fuck around and run it up for a sack
Stealin' weed up out my duffle bag
Only the, birds, take the whole bag
Baby girl, don't try and go there
You already know that

[Chorus]
Every time I'm lost and found, yeah (oh, oh, oh, every time)
This is not the lost and found (yeah)
Whose time are you wasting now? (Whose time are you wasting now?)
'Cause every time I'm lost and found ('cause every time I'm lost and found)
Oh, up and down, back and fourth, all around
Oh, tell me who's really losing out, yeah (tell me who's really losing out)
'Cause you say it's the end and playing games again, I found

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, this is not the lost and found
Whose time are you wasting now?
Yeah
