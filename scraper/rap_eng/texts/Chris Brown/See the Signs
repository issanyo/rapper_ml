[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Elmo]
Elmo come take a walk with me, it's a beautiful day
And I think we should go out into the neighborhood and see what we can see
Look this sign says welcome here and bakery here and thank you there
Will you help me on my way and come along with me?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Elmo]
And, see the signs, they're everywhere
That's enter here and exit there
Let's take it easy as we go
Elmo these are the sounds that we all know

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Stop right there
Dance with me
Closed, open
Wet paint, school
Tell me what signs you see

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Elmo]
Now Elmo come take a walk with me, so many signs to see
When we go out in the neighborhood
Could you ever see so many signs?
See the signs, see the signs

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Elmo]
See the signs, they're everywhere
That's enter here and exit there
Let's take it easy as we go
Elmo these are the sounds that we all know

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Elmo]
Stop right there
Dance with me
Closed, open
Wet paint, school
Tell me what signs you see

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Elmo]
Mail, market
Park and zoo
Food, laundry
That was fun now you try it too

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Stop right there
Dance with me
Closed, open
Wet paint, school
Tell me what signs you see

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Elmo]
Mail, market
Park and zoo
Food, laundry
That was fun now you try it too

[Outro: Chris Brown & Elmo]
Stop right there
Dance with Chris Brown
