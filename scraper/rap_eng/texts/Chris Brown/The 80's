[Verse 1]
When the sun goes down
Record reblown, the horizon comes to life
Blue electric eye
The feeling that haunts me keeps me up at night

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you know where do we go
When we're both stuck in the cold?
City lights, they wait in the dark

[Chorus]
So if the feeling dies, we'll never say goodbye
We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide
Only your love can save me
I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise

[Verse 2]
When the rain falls down
Watch me clean, baptised up in your love, ay
Many dreams are found
Pulling me deeper, deeper to the light so

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you know where do we go
When we're both stuck in the cold?
City lights, they wait in the dark

[Chorus]
So if the feeling dies, we'll never say goodbye
We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide
Only your love can save me
I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise

[Bridge]
This is nostalgic
This is our journey so don't stop believing
And you know that I got this
Constantly playing, oh let me going back in time

[Chorus]
So if the feeling dies, we'll never say goodbye
We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide
Only your love can save me
I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise
So if the feeling dies, we'll never say goodbye
We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide
Only your love can save me
I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise

[Outro]
Back to the 80s, when music was your life
We can have the greatest time
Back to the 80s, the perfect time
We're back in time
