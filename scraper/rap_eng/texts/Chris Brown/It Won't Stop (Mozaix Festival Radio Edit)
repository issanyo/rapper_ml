[Verse 1: Sevyn Streeter]
I love when you pulling up in your Jeep, bumping all your beats
J's on with your shades on, just to bring me something to eat
You the man up in these streets, but when it comes to my heart
That don't mean a thing, no, oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
Baby hop in my ride, ooh, it's hot as hell outside
Got the top down with your doors closed
With my hand up on your thigh
Drive slow, ooh, take your time

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh, yeah
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh, yeah
And it won't stop, stop, stop, stop
And it won't stop, stop, stop, stop
And it won't stop
And it won't stop
And it won't stop
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh, yeah

[Verse 3: Seyvn Streeter & (Chris Brown)]
I love when we pulling up to that beach (that beach)
Sand down in my feet (yeah)
Sun down, nobody round, that's one hell of a scene
You rocking my body (body), rock rock the boat, Aaliyah (body)
Don't it sound familiar?

[Verse 4: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
And you sound like, uh uh, ayy, ayy
Looking up into space
It's just me and my bae
And we feel so amazing, oh, oh, oh, all night, woah

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
Every little thing you do got me feeling some type of way (way, yeah)
When you give me that thunder you make my summer rain
Oh-oh-oh oh, oh, oh-oh-oh oh, oh
Everyday, everyday

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh, yeah
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh, yeah
And it won't stop, stop, stop, stop
And it won't stop, stop, stop, stop
And it won't stop
And it won't stop
And it won't stop
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh, yeah
And it won't stop
