[Verse 1]
Too many killers
Too many killers in my face
Too many killers in my face
Too many people in the way

[Pre-Chorus]
How did you get here?
What are you doing here?
What is your purpose?
Let's just be real, yeah

[Chorus]
Too many killers
Too many killers in my basement
Too many killers
Too many people in the way, oh, no

[Verse 2]
Too many killers
Bodies and the people showin' crazy
Then she come through the niggas
Everybody else Is in a race, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
How did you get here?
What are you doing here? Oh, woah
What is your purpose?
Let's just be real, yeah, yeah (ow!)

[Chorus]
Too many killers
Too many killers in my basement
Too many killers
And too many people in the way

[Verse 3]
Too many niggas in my face
My dawg listenin' so you know I put the pussy in the safe
And we can have you time, we can have your fly for a race
How the fuck niggas in here, yeah yeah
And I need your piece to ride my face
Up and down, up and up and up and down, so you ride it
Baby, you need to celebrate
So I just keep finding a reason pulling your hair

[Chorus]
But it's too many killers
Too many killers in my basement
Too many killers
And too many people in the way
