[Verse 1]
For you, for you
Yeah all this days go by and feels like I'm counting sand
I want you around me to fill up this emptiness
Oh help me write the story with a happy ending with you, oh yeah for you

[Chorus]
I want you close, closer baby
'Cause this long distance ain't working for me
Oh why do you have to be overseas?
'Cause this technology, you know a way it
It don't do it for me, for me
It don't do it for me, for me
(Don't leave me baby, no)
It don't do it for me

[Verse 2]
You know I'mma pull up
Your body, I got the answers, for me
Why you teasing me all the time?

[Chorus]
I want you close, closer baby
'Cause this long distance ain't working for me
Oh why do you have to be overseas?
'Cause this technology, you know a way it
It don't do it for me, for me
It don't do it for me, for me
(Don't leave me baby, no)
It don't do it for me

[Verse 3]
Girl, I need all of your love
The sun down, the sun up, for me (yeah)
For me

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
I want you close, closer baby
'Cause this long distance ain't working for me
Oh why do you have to be overseas?
'Cause this technology, you know a way it
It don't do it for me, for me
It don't do it for me, for me
(Don't leave me baby, no)
It don't do it for me
