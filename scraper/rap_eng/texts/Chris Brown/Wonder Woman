[Intro: DJ Drama]
Well-Well-Well Done
Pay attention
Dramatic, Dramatic

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tonight I want me a wonder woman
Who can save my life
Wanna feel her power right now
A real wonder woman, come be my hero
You can take your cape off
You don't need that to save my heart
You just need to take me, I know you can fly
Because I see right through your disguise

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, damn she bad, damn she bad, heels with the matching bag
Mirror with the lip gloss, lick her lips and then she laugh
Lady Gaga colored Mac, all her friends using that
She could be on magazines, but she ain't really into that
Ow, da-damn she bad (bad), had to say it twice (twice)
It's getting late, you should spend the night (night)
No rushing thangs, got a whole lot of game (game)
And I'm stuck in my ways, but just for you, I'll change
Polaroid camera, put this moment on your freezer
5 in the morning, yawning, kiss ya while you sleeping
Half awake, I can see you peeking
Wake up, baby 'cause

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tonight I want me a wonder woman
Who can save my life
Wanna feel her power right now
A real wonder woman, come be my hero
You can take your cape off
You don't need that to save my heart
You just need to take me, I know you can fly
Because I see right through your disguise

[Verse 2: Tyga]
All shit aside, I love the way you walk
You got that indie glow, give me some time to watch
Freeze, freeze, you put my heart into anesthesia
I love you 'round the clock, won't stop 'til I get enough
Overtime, overtime, I put in for that Valentine
Know you 'preciate it, baby, lingerie La Perla lacing
Let's get naked, rip our clothes off
I'm the doctor, you my nurse in a uniform
Head game outta control, superheroes on the floor
Bruce Banner beat it up, then I turn into the Hulk
Be my Betty Ross
Make the bed rock, all night long

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tonight I want me a wonder woman
Who can save my life
Wanna feel her power right now
A real wonder woman, come be my hero
You can take your cape off
You don't need that to save my heart
You just need to take me, I know you can fly
Because I see right through your disguise

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Well-Well-Well Done
