[Verse 1]
Why you up in here starting drama?
Cutie got the booty with a curve like a comma
We can disappear, M.I.A until tomorrow
We can get, Babey Drew, turn it up
Why you up in here starting drama?
Cutie got the
Baby, I see you over there in your zone
You know this might work though, I'm in my zone too man
Why you up in here starting drama?
Cutie got the booty with a curve like a comma
We can disappear, M.I.A until tomorrow
We can get down
Feels like I should be throwing hundred bills when you pass me
Know what's on my mind, girl you ain't gotta ask me
I don't need no digits, I ain't come to do no math
I just wanna get gone

[Pre-Chorus]
I got you baby girl so you can relax, the way you do that
Girl the way you move that, I don't let them do that
You know I'm on a mission, I ain't tryna get missing
I'm trying to get love

[Chorus]
Lose all your girlfriend you came with
And I ain't gotta tell the homies where I'm going girl
We can go AWOL, AWOL
Turn off the phone, baby girl you won't need it
Nobody is gon' be able to reach you this evening girl
Cause we gon' go AWOL, AWOL

[Verse 2]
God damn I love the way you fit them Dolce & Gabannas
The way she dancing, make me wanna get behind her
We can take a cruise off of Gilligan's Island
And just get lost
I got the mister high money, I'm your skipper and your doctor
We can light it up and blast off like a rocket
Grown in the wind we grown, ain't nobody watching
We can get lost

[Pre-Chorus]
I got you baby girl so you can relax, the way you do that
Girl the way you move that, I don't let them do that
You know I'm on a mission, I ain't tryna get missing
I'm trying to get love

[Chorus]
Lose all your girlfriend you came with
And I ain't gotta tell the homies where I'm going girl
We can go AWOL, AWOL
Turn off the phone, baby girl you won't need it
Nobody is gon' be able to reach you this evening girl
Cause we gon' go AWOL, AWOL

[Bridge]
We about to wile out now
Let it all hang out now
Ain't no turning back around now
It's going all the way down now
Ain't nobody gotta know, follow me and I can take you there
Don't worry 'bout the time, it's irrelevant, we can do it anywhere
We can do this real nasty
Put your legs up in the air, air, air, air

[Chorus]
Lose all your girlfriend you came with
And I ain't gotta tell the homies where I'm going girl
We can go AWOL, AWOL
Turn off the phone, baby girl you won't need it
Nobody is gon' be able to reach you this evening girl
Cause we gon' go AWOL, AWOL

[Outro]
Baby I'm the first captain, you my sergeant
Damn right, I'm tryna get you wetter than New Orleans
I ain't tryina beat it up, I'm tryna just massage it
Up against the wall
