[Verse: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
No air, no air, ain't there
No air, no air, ain't there
No air
No air, no air, ain't there
No air, no air, ain't there
No air, no air
No air, no air, ain't there
No air, no air, ain't there
No air, no air, ain't there
No air, no air, ain't there

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air
No air, air, oh
No air, air, no
'Cause my world revolves around you, it's so hard for me to breathe
Hard for me to breathe
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
No air, no air
No air, no air
No air, no air
No air, no air

[Verse: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
No air, no air
No air, no air, ain't there
No air, no air, ain't there
No air, no air, ain't there
No air, no air, ain't there
