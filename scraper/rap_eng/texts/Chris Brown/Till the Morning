[Verse 1]
It's a party on the weekend, know you been working hard all day
Now it's time to turn up, yeah I know you feel the same
Baby you just wanna go out, just to do little dancing
It's a shame you brought yo man with you, know you feeling kinda antsy

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me show I got everything paid for
If he got a problem I got way more
She fucking with a boss, I make a name for
And I'mma give her everything she came for

[Chorus]
'Til the morning
I'ma do my thing, girl I ain't lying we gon' do this
'Til the morning
Cause you're all I need, I don't need no sleep tonight
'Til the morning
Gon' and tell your friends that I don't get tired
We gon' do this 'til the morning
Oh yeah babe, oh yeah babe, we gon' do it 'til the morning

[Verse 2]
Party, party and put your glass in the air
If you in love make a toast, take your clothes off, put yo ass in the air
This is the party, party and I know you don't really do this all the time
Got your body on mine and your man over there looking mad as hell

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything paid for
If he got a problem I got way more
She fucking with a boss, I make a name for
And I'ma give her everything she came for

[Chorus]
'Til the morning
I'ma do my thing, girl I ain't lying we gon' do this
'Til the morning
Cause you're all I need, I don't need no sleep tonight
'Til the morning
Gon' and tell your friends that I don't get tired
We gon' do this 'til the morning
Oh yeah babe, oh yeah babe, we gon' do it 'til the morning

[Verse 3]
Okay, I got your nigga grillin' me the hardest
I'ma eat the pussy girl, regardless
I stay down South like I'm from New-Orleans
Spray up on them walls and them drawers like an artist
I got that long dick, nigga legendary
Where you get that ass from? Bet that it's hereditary
Pussy numb, speakin' in tongues, changin' your vocabulary
Callin' me her Valentine, it ain't even February
I got the antidote
I leave the condoms on the bed so her man'll know
I know he mad cause I'm bustin' on your cantaloupes
It's horses on the 'Rari but I'm checkin' camel toe
Look, no sleep baby we gon' pull an all-nighter
I got the weed and the liquor, girl just bring a lighter
You gon' sing baby I'ma have you moanin'
It's just a warnin', I'm performin'

[Chorus]
'Til the morning
I'ma do my thing, girl I ain't lying we gon' do this
'Til the morning
Cause you're all I need, I don't need no sleep tonight
'Til the morning
Gon' and tell your friends that I don't get tired
We gon' do this 'til the morning
Oh yeah babe, oh yeah babe, we gon' do it 'til the morning
