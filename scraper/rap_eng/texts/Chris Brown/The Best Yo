[Intro]
I don't know what it is, there's just something about you
Huh, I mean I don't think I can be in love this early
But maybe I can
But you the best

[Verse 1]
All of these chances we take from day to day
Constantly working, travelling from place to place
I wanna find a place where my love can stay, so you just promise you won't give my love away
Girl let's get our dance on, and I'mma kiss your neck and put my hands on your body

[Pre-Chorus]
We can do this thing nice and slow
We can take it round the world let's go
Girl you know you play the biggest part
Take it back to the start where we fell in love
Ooh girl you got that body, I can't take it babe
I want it, I just really really want it
Got anything you need baby
Just come with me baby ha ah

[Chorus]
It don't matter where we go, London as Heathrow
I'll take you 'round the world baby and back
Because you're special
You the best yo, uh let's go
And you know I'm a go-getter, but shawty is a winner
You need a girl who wants you just like that
Because you're special
You the best yo, let's go

[Verse 2]
Girl your body matches your face, and I want it all
Bring your body over here, I ain't scared to break you off
I'm 'bout to go in so hard, deeper and deeper
If me and your body could love exchange, all these positions girl let's switch it up

[Pre-Chorus]
We can do this thing nice and slow
We can take it round the world let's go
Girl you know you play the biggest part
Take it back to the start where we fell in love
Ooh girl you got that body, I can't take it babe
I want it, I just really really want it
Got anything you need baby
Just come with me baby ha ah

[Chorus]
It don't matter where we go, London as Heathrow
I'll take you 'round the world baby and back
Because you're special
You the best yo, uh let's go
And you know I'm a go-getter, but shawty is a winner
You need a girl who wants you just like that
Because you're special
You the best yo, let's go

[Bridge]
Can't nobody else, do me like you do, make a nigga wanna spend them dolla's on you boo
Do it by yourself, girl that's all you, I can't get your booty out of my mind
Girl you're a stallion, you know you the truth
Can we make love right now? Right now, right now, right now, right now

[Chorus]
It don't matter where we go, London as Heathrow
I'll take you 'round the world baby and back
Because you're special
You the best yo, uh let's go
And you know I'm a go-getter, but shawty is a winner
You need a girl who wants you just like that
Because you're special
You the best yo, let's go
