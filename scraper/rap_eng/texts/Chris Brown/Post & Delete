[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Had to block your account and unfollow your ass
Yeah, bitch, you the worst
And if you try to tag me, I'ma start spazzin'
Shade room and baller alert
I was just mindin' my business, it was just me and my niggas
You started likin' his pictures
I started pipin' these bitches
Pussy pop a Perc' and get busy
I'm about to fuck around and call this bitch
Like delete all that shit
Can't keep my name out your mouth, eatin' all that dick
Jugglin' my balls and shit
Always tryna record my conversations like a fedorale
And everybody tryna race me like I'm Ricky Bobby
Black Pyramid, that don't mean I'm Illuminati
Ain't gotta pull a trigger, homies got a couple bodies, believe that
I ain't with the fake shit, chopper gon' spray shit
Bitch, you like Emoji with the faces
Never give the police my statement
Never say shit 'bout the bricks that I had up in my basement
Stop it, what the fuck you want from me?
Know my time and my money, bitch, that ain't free
What you call a king with a chain? A masterpiece
And don't talk that shit if you gon' post and delete, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I've been drinking so much champagne (woah)
See me, swerving in the Wraith (yeah)
She act like I'm her chauffeur (yeah)

[Verse 3: Zoey Dollaz]
Shawty, got all in her feelings
Told her, I ain't with the Instagram
Little mama, when we chillin'
I ain't down with the filmin'
No Snapchat or no Periscope
You can do that shit, but not by me though
Don't want no pics in the Rover
How many times  did I done told you?
Personally, that shit ain't too cool with me
Everyone know you a freak
Tryna keep the shit low-key
So I just post and delete
You want the wave
Takin' pictures when you up in the Wraith
Stars in the ceiling
They know when you in the buildin'

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I've been drinking so much champagne (woah)
See me, swerving in the Wraith (yeah)
She act like I'm her chauffeur (yeah)
She want a standing ovation (yeah)

Commas as if we conversate (sate)
Tryna throw it in my face (face)
Tryna get me out my game, I say
