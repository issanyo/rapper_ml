[Intro]
Let this bloodclatt go

[Chorus: Casanova]
With that Draco, I'ma kill a nigga
I'm a gorilla, nigga
Where you at? Where you go?
Rain, sleet, hail, snow
OHB gon' let it blow
We gon' kill you for the low
So we ridin' round with Biggie on us
Niggas tried to pull a Diddy on us
But I'm Hov with the Glock though
Or Spiz with the sig, yo
I pull up to where you live, bro
Wavin' that chopper out the window

[Verse 1: Young Lo]
Yeah, I'm ridin' like Pac, play Suge and get shot (Bop!)
I'm like Eazy on the corner, Ice Cube's in a pot (Boom boom boom)
Yeah, today was a good day
Made a mil' off of Pills like Dr. Dre (Woo!)
'Cause murder was the case that they gave me
I hit it doggy style, now Brenda got a baby (Ugh!)
Hard as ice tea on me, they wanna get the guy (Why?)
I pull that MAC-10 and spray it with a crooked eye (Where you blowin')

[Chorus: Casanova]
With that Draco, I'ma kill a nigga
I'm a gorilla, nigga
Where you at? Where you go?
Rain, sleet, hail, snow
OHB gon' let it blow
We gon' kill you for the low
So we ridin' round with Biggie on us
Niggas tried to pull a Diddy on us
But I'm Hov with the Glock though
Or Spiz with the sig, yo
I pull up to where you live, bro
Wavin' that chopper out the window

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
OHB, DMV, where you think it all started, nigga?
You started with 'em, I started trippin', this Virginia (Yeah)
100 clips and I'm pushin' T's
On my Timbaland shit like I made the beat (Yeow)
I'm for real, my nigga, boy, don't play with me
Shout out to Missy but ain't no misdemeanors, we catchin' felonies
Where you think you get all your drugs from?
How you know the plug? Where you think you get your guns from?
3 shooters, 3 shots, fish bombs like AI
Neck cold but I stay hot, we do walk ups, that's a face shot
Richard Mille, yours a fake watch
I love pullin' triggers, I don't take shots

[Chorus: Casanova]
With that Draco, I'ma kill a nigga
I'm a gorilla, nigga
Where you at? Where you go?
Rain, sleet, hail, snow
OHB gon' let it blow
We gon' kill you for the low
So we ridin' round with Biggie on us
Niggas tried to pull a Diddy on us
But I'm Hov with the Glock though
Or Spiz with the sig, yo
I pull up to where you live, bro
Wavin' that chopper out the window

[Verse 3: Casanova]
Let me bust a rhyme for you cats
Shoot up the club, I'm like Shyne with the gat
Throw your queen over the bridge
Tell your bitch this were Nas used to live
I'm from the jungle but it's concrete
I bring havoc when I mob deep
Fuck around and be a dead man
I'm a Blood, you could call me red man
I'm in the telly with a lot of girls
Or in your bitch belly like I'm Tommy Bunds
And if I ever land on D block
I'ma wild out like the 3 LOX

[Chorus: Casanova]
With that Draco, I'ma kill a nigga
[I'm a gorilla, nigga]
Where you at? Where you go?
Rain, sleet, hail, snow
OHB gon' let it blow
We gon' kill you for the low
So we ridin' round with Biggie on us
Niggas tried to pull a Diddy on us
But I'm Hov with the Glock though
Or Spiz with the sig, yo
I pull up to where you live, bro
Wavin' that chopper out the window
