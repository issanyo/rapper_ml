[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Stuck in the middle of my past and my future
It's stuck in between us, tryna give love another try
But it's tripping me up 'cause I'd rather go on and be lonely
Damn it, I give up, so I'll be gone with the wind, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you gotta let me go
'Cause you never help me when I fall down, fall face down

[Chorus]
I'm far away 'cause you bring me down like gravity
I just gotta run away
I need space, it's hard for me to break away from you
It's hard for me to get away from you
It's hard for me to get away, hard, hard, hard
It's hard for me to run away, hard, hard, hard
It's hard for me to get away

[Verse 2]
Feeling lost, back and fourth, travelling on this bumpy road
Can you please listen to me? I don't need the games, girl, I want out
The middle of the street, on my knees and the traffic on the highway
I used to believe you were good for me, my life's turning upside down

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you gotta let me go
'Cause you never help me when I fall down, fall face down

[Chorus]
I'm far away 'cause you bring me down like gravity
I just gotta run away
I need space, it's hard for me to break away from you
It's hard for me to get away from you
It's hard for me to get away, hard, hard, hard
It's hard for me to run away, hard, hard, hard
It's hard for me to get away

[Bridge]
Now I'm falling faster, your love's my disaster
Let me live, I can't take this any more
Now I'm falling faster, your love's my disaster
Let me live, oh

[Chorus]
I'm far away, yeah 'cause you bring me down like gravity
I just gotta run away
I need space, yeah yeah yeah yeah, it's hard for me to break away from you
It's hard for me to get away from you
It's hard for me to get away
It's hard for me to run away, yeah yeah yeah
It's hard for me to get away from you
Oh, yeah yeah yeah, oh woah, yeah yeah

[Outro]
Oh no, it's hard for me to get away from you, oh oh
It's hard for me to get away, it's hard for me to run away
It's hard for me to get away
