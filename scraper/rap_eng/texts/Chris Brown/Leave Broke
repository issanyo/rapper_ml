[Chorus: Chris Brown & Famous Fresh]
She workin' that pole, she's so unbelievable, believable, oh (unbelievable) (haha, Fresh!)
She's outta control, up and down, unbelievable, believable, oh (unbelievable)
She be workin' that body, (damn) I'ma leave broke, leave broke (I'ma leave broke, leave broke, leave broke)
Throwin' 1s, 5s, 10s, 20s, 100s, I'ma leave broke, leave broke (yeah) (leave broke, leave broke)

[Verse 1: Famous Fresh]
Ooh, baby, got a booty like a onion (good Lord)
In Secret Sunday, poppin' bottles, throwin' money
Lame niggas in the corner, broke, ballin' on a budget (ah)
Baby droppin' from the cellin', bust it open for a hunnid, you bad (racks)
Lookin' like you came out a pageant
All that ass, like you made by Stalin
Got all this cash like nigga was Italian
My car go fast, let me take you to my palace, skrrt
Her body marked up with ink (woo)
Brown skin with her weave
She a dope girl in the streets, freak in the sheets
Somethin' sweet to eat, sadity (what?)
Shoes by Fendi, fine like Kimmy
When she move, got a nigga hypnotized, no Biggie
She only fuck with bad boys like Diddy
So you wanna ride with me, top down through the city (haha)
Cuban links and gold Rollies
Birkin bags filled with dead homies
Damn, it's my type
But shawty, back that ass up for me, woadie
Workin' her body like she a pro
Twerkin' slow, touchin' her toes
Up and down on that pole
Got me throwin' bread 'til I go broke, woah, woah, woah, woah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Famous Fresh]
She workin' that pole, she's so unbelievable, believable, oh (unbelievable) (haha, yeah)
She's outta control, up and down, unbelievable, believable, oh (unbelievable)
She be workin' that body, (damn) I'ma leave broke, leave broke (I'ma leave broke, leave broke, leave broke)
Throwin' 1s, 5s, 10s, 20s, 100s, I'ma leave broke, leave broke (yeah) (leave broke, leave broke)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Ha, girl, come and vibe with a rich nigga
I'm rockin' skinny jeans like it make my dick bigger
I pay 100 for that ass, I'm a sick nigga
I'm pourin' up the codeine, I don't sip liquor
Man, these fuck niggas ballin' on a budget
Bitches know that I been ballin' and I love it
Marshawn Lynch, I'm smokin' skittles in a bucket
Fruit Town with me, come and go two rounds with me, you know a fade is nothin'
I got a bitch with a body, call her bass and percussion
With my hands throwin' bands, she gon' stand for nothin'
You cuffin', you probably workin' with the man or somethin'
I'm African bandstand, how my niggas is drummin'
And you niggas wanna be like
Smokin' weed and flyin' on a G5
Bust a gun for my niggas from the east side
Nigga sling gold records like bean pies
I love them long nights when you up on the stripper pole
You know all my lil' niggas is trained to go
Dark night Lamborghini, red painted in gold
In the Wraith and it feel like a rodeo, oh
I'm throwin' 100s and givin' them babies, yeah
And if you drink what I drink, you think that I'm crazy

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Famous Fresh]
'Cause she workin' that pole, she's so unbelievable, believable, oh (unbelievable)
She's outta control, up and down, unbelievable, believable, oh (unbelievable)
She be workin' that body, (damn) I'ma leave broke, leave broke (I'ma leave broke, leave broke, leave broke)
Throwin' 1s, 5s, 10s, 20s, 100s, I'ma leave broke, leave broke (yeah) (leave broke, leave broke)

[Outro: Famous Fresh]
Haha, it's Fresh
