[Verse 1]
You would think we in a waterbed, all the sheets are soaked
I'm glad that I ain't gotta work today cause last night I did the most
Girl you would think I was inside your head cause I know everything you want
And no one asked you if you got a man and do I care? I don't, that's when we started sexing

[Pre-Chorus]
It's getting loud got 'em feeling like they in the clouds
Got them screaming like they in the crowd
I make them scream
Baby, baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
When you scream I need to pull your body closer, let me sex you babe
Girl, you better not change your mind
Cause girl we got one night only, one just to love right, baby
You're my biggest fan, girl, I want you to holler

[Verse 2]
Two girls I'm watching, "No" is not an option
I'm gon' be the captain of the ship, they gon' have my boat a-rocking
Singing to them like Lionel Richie all night long, getting these bitches, they playing my song
We switching positions and I got the money so I'm granting they wishes, I'll be they sugar daddy

[Pre-Chorus]
It's getting loud, got 'em feeling like they in the clouds
Got them screaming like they in the crowd
I make them scream

[Chorus]
When you scream I need to pull your body closer, let me sex you babe
Girl, you better not change your mind
Cause girl we got one night only, one just to love right, baby
You're my biggest fan, girl, I want you to holler

[Verse 3]
Gon' girl, tear it up, you can make it clap, for me girl, give it up
God damn, you fine, I'm 'bout to stand up, stand up
I just came here just to make you holler, doing it for hours, even in the shower
Over and over again, baby I'm all up in your garden, kissing flowers
Are you ready? I'mma take what's mine and get comfortable
Slow and easy, I'm kinda tipsy from this wine
So what I say might be a little confusing
I got a Magnum in my wallet, I'mma pull it out, I bet that I use it, I'm gon' make you scream

[Chorus]
When you scream I need to pull your body closer, let me sex you babe
Girl, you better not change your mind
Cause girl we got one night only, one just to love right, baby
You're my biggest fan, girl, I want you to holler
When you scream I need to pull your body closer, let me sex you babe
Girl, you better not change your mind
Cause girl we got one night only, one just to love right, baby
You're my biggest fan, girl, I want you to holler
