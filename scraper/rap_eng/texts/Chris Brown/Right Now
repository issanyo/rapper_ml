[Hook]
I'm a beast, I'm a motherfucking monster
Hollywood, living good, need to conquer
Loving money, loving fame but you know I need it all
Gotta have it all, need it all right now
Gotta have it all, need it all right now
Gotta have it all ‘cause I need it right now
‘Cause I need it right now

[Verse 1]
Now let me show you how I am the best, hands down
This is my city, yeah, I got it fitted round
Y'all keep playing around, y'all gonna get hit
This is it, Chris and Da Illest killing shit, you know you did it
Real is up in this building, yeah, you know that I get it
Spend the chips, I got bread in, so yeah, you know I'm ‘bout business
Pop a bottle and celebrate, getting high, no elevate
And I'm sitting on the top floor of that mansion, yeah
You know what it is, tryna buy that penthouse in them Hamptons
New York, LA, they love, yeah, they know where I'm from
They want, they watch they man, you know I'mma get dance
People say I'm from my city up on that map
Just like that, I did it like that
In the back and I'm giving all them haters heart attack
They like damn, this nigga made it, damn, this nigga famous
You know what it is, you know what it is

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I guess you could say I went cocky on ‘em
…it's like a dream, it's time to wake up
Young got his cake up, no machine from Kelly but it's time to lace up
The way I do you, girl, I'm talking face up
This the kind of moment I need it alive, yeah
Can't do no wrong, it's time to get it right
New shoes, new car, bottle of Ciroc
Rock top, Bentley top in the Maybach
I'm on fire, boy, I'm fine
It's the grand, this moment, yeah, it's my time
So why y'all hate? Y'all let me shine
Yeah, I told ‘em ‘cause I'mma do it
I told ‘em ‘cause I'mma do it
