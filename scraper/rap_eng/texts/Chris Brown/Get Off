[Intro]
Me, me
Me, me, me

[Verse 1]
I'm ready for you
And girl, you better feel the same
Take a shower and change
Girl, I'll be in the bed waiting (yeah, yeah)
Girl, kick off your shoes, be your masseuse
And feel my fingers all on your body and through your hair
Ain't 'bout to start complaining love it when your raining
Pussy popping, we be fucking everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
Make sure you call me when you get off
When you get to my crib, take that shit off
I know that we gon' get fucked up, girl, this the last call
For love and alcohol, you better show your ass off, yay yay

[Chorus]
I'm tryna fuck you in the middle of the night
1 AM, 2 AM, second round, three, four, five
I wanna do all the freaky shit that you like, baby
I'ma fuck you right, make sure you call me when you get off

[Verse 2]
I know that you tired, I don't really care
'Cause I know that pussy mine, baby, bring it here
I wanna put my tongue where your thong is
Baby, as long as you just give me both lips, who your daddy?
When I hit it, look back at me, snackin' then I'm smackin'
Smashin', blastin' 'cause I know your booty ain't plastic
Ooh, look at you, you the baddest, I'ma hit it like a nigga never had it
Really don't like static but I need love, when we do the nasty, it's magic

[Pre-Chorus]
Make sure you call me when you get off (get)
When you get to my crib, take that shit off (take it off)
I know that we gon' get fucked up, girl, this the last call
For love and alcohol, you better show your ass off, yay yay (love and alcohol, yeah)

[Chorus]
I'm tryna fuck you in the middle of the night
1 AM, 2 AM, second round, three, four, five
I wanna do all the freaky shit that you like, baby
I'ma fuck you right, make sure you call me when you get off

[Bridge]
Call me when you're about to get off
You better show up
No more talking
I'm tired of stalking you
I might sound like I'm crazy and wild 'cause I just wanna lay with you
Fuckin' it up and I cuddle with you
Had a long day, you're 'bout to have a long night
You ain't gon' get no sleep, girl but you'll be alright

[Chorus]
I'm tryna fuck you in the middle of the night
1 AM, 2 AM, second round, three, four, five
I wanna do all the freaky shit that you like, baby
I'ma fuck you right, make sure you call me when you get off

[Outro]
Call me when you get off
Make sure you call me when you get off
Call me when you get off
Make sure you call me when you get off
