Work that, work that, work that, work that, work that, work that (work that, work that)

[Verse 1: Verbal]
Girl in a purple, said she thirsty, pass that Grappa, swig that girlfriend (swig that)
So heated, this weekend, best lookin' earthling yet to surface
"She's taken, what's the purpose?" "Just lookin', can I do that?"
Wanna do that, chauffeur that thing back home, just watch her work that
Her shirt be burstin' when she twist and twerk that skirt get
Lifted high, so sci-fi, said she shy, yeah, right
Mou soutou makki shoujou pokke ni rocket, doushiyou doushi you
Tokyo mousou Boyz ga bakusou koudo joushou, we in motion (yep, uh)

[Verse 2: Ryo-Z]
He say, she say, tb rikuesuto manma no shiikensu de fukai groove
P-senpai say line for the bathroom donna saizu mo hitomi de saisun
Top kara andaa wesuto hippu hot na nanbaa ga kakareba zock on
Minna de Willie Bounce ano ko to, dirty wine tokku no tou ni wasureteruze hajirai
Marude mayonaka juu no majinai furoa, chuu yurasu Bassline ni kanjinai?

[Verse 3: Wise]
Uh, she got crazy charisma, body like a magnet hikiokosu asthma

Ooh, I've seen that on video, tame her like a Mustang, ride it like in a rodeo
Oh, that's what I mean move it slow, work that thing like you wanna be a pro (ha)
Uh, straight from Tokyo, nemuranai machi he youkoso
Neon lights shinin' bright, kanojo ga haku jeans mitaku tight
Machi wa glamorous yoru wa scandalous, can you really hang with us?
Aji wa kakubetsu teriyaki maji desu yo, can you handle this?

[Verse 4: Ilmari]
Tokyo no neon mitai ni shinin', furoa de nousatsu sarecha YABAI
Taito na saijingu, oh sono badii, furesshu de raika sanmi no kiku pain
