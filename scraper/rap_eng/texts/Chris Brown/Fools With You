[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
White flag, hands up
I ain't got no room for them, no
If love was a crime
I'd be doing way more than life

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl I'm through, all I see is you
You're my heart, girl I fools with you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tell me when, tell me where
Whatever you want, baby I'd do it all for you
Caught in love, got me sprung
I mean it and I don't give a damn
All these girls on my head like a fresh cut
Tryna get your spot, but they gets no love
Caught in love, got me sprung
Baby for the things you do, I fools with you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You are what's up, baby
I ain't got no reason to lie
Girl I'm feeling locked in, but not stuck
With you, ain't never a waste of time

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah yeah, girl I'm through, all I see is you
You're my heart, girl I fools with you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tell me when, tell me where
Whatever you want, baby I'd do it all for you
Caught in love, got me sprung
I mean it and I don't give a damn
All these girls on my head like a fresh cut
Tryna get your spot, but they gets no love
Caught in love, got me sprung
Baby for the things you do, I fools with you

[Bridge]
And when the rain falls down, tries to flood us out
My love will be your raft girl
Anything you need, promise I will be
Baby, you can count on me
I'm ready right now no pressure on you (uh huh)
The only kind of fool I wanna be is the kind that fools with you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tell me when, tell me where
Whatever you want, baby I'd do it all for you
Caught in love, got me sprung
I mean it and I don't give a damn
All these girls on my head like a fresh cut
Tryna get your spot, but they gets no love
Caught in love, got me sprung
Baby for the things you do, I fools with you
