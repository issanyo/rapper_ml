[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Before I get started, Polo, this beat is retarded
So I'ma go short yellow bus flow and take her heart like February 1-4
Y'all know I dos what I did, so go and does what you do
And you should come with the flu, cause girl you sick, shorty just sick
And she see Dr. Carter, I got the order
I make her tell her boyfriend not to bother
Cause we get busy
We get silly, we get really
Drunk, and we do anything we want
And we go anywhere she like
But it's only for the night
Until forever, I'm so on another level
I'm so on another pedestal, my foot is on the pedal
I never ever swerve, baby, I'm on that syrup, baby
I know you fast, but I can make you -er, baby
Don't hit the curve baby, yes, I'm for sure, baby
I know you're hot but I can make you hotter, baby
Like fur, baby, now we got PETA hatin'
But we put great to the test, and now we the greatest
And Weezy, he the greatest and this beat the greatest
And Polo he the greatest, rest in peace, Pimp C, the greatest
I'm gone

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
It's you and me
Moving at the speed of light into eternity yeah
Tonight is the night to join me in the middle of ecstasy
Feel the melody in the rhythm of the music around you, around you
I'mma take you there
I'mma take you there
So don't be scared
I'm right here baby
We can go anywhere, go anywhere
But first it's your chance
Take my hand come with me

[Hook]
It's like I've waited my whole life for this one night
It's gonna be me you and the dance floor
Cause we've only got one night
Double your pleasure
Double your fun and dance
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever on the dance floor

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
It's a long way down, we so high off the ground
Sending for an angel to bring me your heart
Girl, where did you come from?
Got me so undone
Gaze in your eyes got me saying
"What a beautiful lady", no ifs, ands or maybes
I'm releasing my heart and it's feeling amazing
There's no one else that matters, you love me
And I won't let you fall, girl
Let you fall, girl

[Verse 4: Lupe Fiasco]
It's like infinity
We're already at where we finna be
Meaning let's make our hopes our memories
Happily ever after endlessly
You the president of Me and You Industries
So its drop Love Inc. on our enemies
Recycle all their negative energies
Then build Shake Em Haters Off ministries
Trust, God willing, they could be like us
Out of our minds, in love, you know thus
But, until then, let's keep it on the hush
Cause they comin for our heads like brush cut
I interrupt the path how its going down
On second thought, let's keep it on the loud
If they don't know then, then they can know now
They don't know the way to do it, then we can show em how
