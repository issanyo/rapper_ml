[Verse 1]
Oh, what a day
Them boys they wild, they run with the Ks
But them boys are blue they won't catch a case
Hands up, don't shoot, ain't nobody safe

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm just tryna love you
I'm tryna give my all to you (oh yeah)
Might fuck around and empty the safe
So come with me now, let's just run away

[Chorus]
Run away-way, now (yeah, woo)
Way, woah, yeah
Way, come on
Run away 'cause nobody safe
'Cause no 'cause nobody safe

[Verse 2]
Pushin' up on me and I don't like it, like it
Who is your homie? I need his ID
I see them lights flashin' behind me
Thinking 'bout life and what do I need?
I see my life, sitting beside me
Hospital lights, stuck with the IV, oh
But them boys in blue, they won't catch a case, no (case)
Hands up, don't shoot, ain't nobody safe, yeah
And I'm just tryna keep my cool, you're going too far

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm just tryna love you
I'm tryna give my all to you
Might fuck around and empty the safe
So come with me now, let's just run away

[Chorus]
Run away-way, now
Way, woah, yeah
Way, come on
Run away 'cause nobody safe
'Cause no 'cause nobody safe

[Verse 3]
You got a glass heart
It's hard to reach you but if you'll see through
Skip through the sad parts
Forgive but never forget who you are
'Cause your smile, it just reminds me
How I can never put you behind me
Baby, you can ride shotgun
Or make love in the backseat
Make a difference, change my life and save me
Don't even know it
Make a difference, change my life and save me
Don't even know it

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm just tryna love you (love you)
I'm tryna give my all to you (oh yeah)
Might fuck around and empty the safe (empty the safe)
So come with me now, let's just run away (just run away)

[Chorus]
Run away-way, now (now)
Way, woah, yeah
Way, come on
Run away 'cause nobody safe
'Cause no 'cause nobody safe (nobody safe)
