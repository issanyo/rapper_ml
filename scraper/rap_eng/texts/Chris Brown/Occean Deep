[Intro]
Drumma Boy

[Verse]
This is romance, stars stance, as both worlds collide
I wanna dive occean deep
Until I fill me inside you, oh
I'm already qualified to give you what you want
Go 'head and close the blinds
It's just passion and loving, ain't tryna waste your time
Live in the moment, don't let it pass you by

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm about to take off my attire
I'm showing off
Tonight is the day when I set your soul on fire
I'm showing off
