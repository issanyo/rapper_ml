[Intro]
Haha

[Verse 1]
We got all night to play (C'mon, baby)
All of the games, your body wants to play (Yeah)
I ain’t gon' get it
Baby, your body ain’t hard to entertain
And I see you gon’ listen to every little word (Word)
I say, and girl we gon’ do it like this
So, put your legs up for daddy
And baby, I want you to let me take control
Girl, I know that you like it

[Chorus]
You always call me Big Poppa when I’m in it
And I’m Notorious for being big
Oh, oh, B.I.G, baby
Girl, I know you loving it (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
You always call me Big Poppa when I’m in it
And I’m Notorious for being Big
B.I.G, baby
Girl, I know you loving it when I do it big

[Verse 2]
I’m kissing you now
I got you all figured out
I know it makes you scream, baby
I know it makes you say, "Ouch"
Baby, massage it and work the kinks out
Yeah, that’s the shit, I’m talking about
I wanna love you, ’til I can no more, I do
Baby, I’ma make you mine now
I don’t care, if you got other plans

When I’m in it, do the money dance
Them bands make her dance

[Chorus]
You always call me Big Poppa when I’m in it
And I’m Notorious for being big
Oh, oh, B.I.G, baby
Girl, I know you loving it (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
You always call me Big Poppa when I’m in it
And I’m Notorious for being Big
