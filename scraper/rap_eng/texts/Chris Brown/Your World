[Intro]
Your world, I wanna live in it
Your world, I wanna live in it
Your world, I wanna live in it
Your world, your world

[Verse 1]
I been, chilling on the beach down in Mexico
Staring at the lights up in Tokyo, dancing in Spain as the rain falls down
I been, in New York City where they never sleep, first class flights on my way to Greece
I been everywhere and back around

[Pre-Chorus]
See I been to London
I been through France
And all that means nothing
If you don't give me a chance

[Chorus]
Cause it's your world, yeah it your world
That I've never been until you let me in
Cause in my world, yeah in my world
I can never win until you let me into your world

[Verse 2]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you every night, picturing your body laying next to mine
What's it gonna take for you to open up? Ooh, tell me
Cause I wanna know everything about your world
I wanna be there when you need me girl, I wanna be more than a fool in love

[Pre-Chorus]
See I been to London
I've been through France
And all that means nothing
If you don't give me a chance

[Chorus]
Cause it's your world, yeah it your world
That I've never been until you let me in
Cause in my world, yeah in my world
I can never win until you let me into your world

[Bridge]
Baby let me dive into your ocean
Let me wish up on your shooting star
We gotta put this thing in motion
Bring our two worlds to the same heart
Your world, I wanna live in it
Your world, I wanna live in it
Your world, I wanna live in it
Your world, come on girl

[Chorus]
Cause it's your world, yeah it your world
That I've never been until you let me in
Cause in my world, yeah in my world
I can never win until you let me into your world
Cause it's your world, yeah it your world
That I've never been until you let me in
Cause in my world, yeah in my world
I can never win until you let me into your world

[Outro]
Your world, I wanna live in it, I wanna live in it
Your world, I wanna live in it, just need to live in it
Your world, I wanna live in it, I wanna live in it
Your world, your world, your world
Your world, I wanna live in it
Your world, I wanna live in it
Your world, I wanna live in it
Your world, your world, your world, your world
