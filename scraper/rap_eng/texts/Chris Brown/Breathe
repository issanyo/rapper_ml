[Verse 1]
Every night I sleep and dream of you
You was the one I thought I'd never lose
Losing is just another part of life
Living is dead without you by my side

[Chorus]
Now I'm holding onto memories
Hoping you would return back to me
So I can breathe
So I can breathe

[Verse 2]
Taking for granted what was always free
Freedom was known, will you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me
I was a fool who thinks I had a voice in the matter
Now I'm alone and left without a choice

[Chorus]
Won't you reminisce on memories?
Hoping you would return back to me
So I can breathe
So I can breathe, yeah

[Bridge]
Ooh, girl, I know I'm wrong
Should have never let you in all alone, oh, no, no
Because I was unworthy and you were all I needed
And I tried to let it go, ooh, I can't help it

[Chorus]
Won't you reminisce on memories?
Hoping you would return back to me
I been reaching out on every breath
On every breath, baby
Just release this tension in my chest
So I can breathe
Girl, so I can breathe, baby

[Outro]
Girl, I know I'm wrong
Should have never let you go all alone, baby
