[Verse 1]
Her voice embedded in my head and the bezel of my heart
It's spelling her name and it's tearing me
'Cause I can't get her in my hands to put her on my arm
These expensive things are just wearing me
'Cause nothing even matters if her sun shines
Trapped in behind the clouds most of the time
I finally see why they guard her soul 'cause she's priceless
But there's something that she ought to know, so

[Pre-Chorus]
She got me picking up rocks, tossing them at her window
Baby, come outside
I gave it two or three knocks, standing at the front door
'Cause I done ran out of rocks
Oh I gotta get up and let her know she's perfect in ways
She couldn't think of and I think about her every day
This might not be love but this crush
Got me wanting to tell you today

[Chorus]
You're a diamond in the rough, dust you off, baby
I wanna make you shine for me
And if I can take you out, I'll show you off baby
I want the whole world to see
Your future looks so blind 'cause they say I'm a star
But you can carry your own light, shed some light on my heart
You're a diamond in the rough
I wanna make you shine for me, shine for me, shine for me

[Verse 2]
Now this, might be the only time to say it
We're finally face to face and maybe, ha
You're probably scared to be put out on display
To be part of a showcase
But if I could paint a picture, you'd be my Mona Lisa
Baby, you're a work of art
And just when I thought I had her, baby girl, picked her bag up
Told me watch out, then she ran back into the house now

[Pre-Chorus]
She got me picking up rocks, tossing them at her window
Baby, come outside
I gave it two or three knocks, standing at the front door
'Cause I done ran out of rocks
Oh I gotta get up and let her know she's perfect in ways
She couldn't think of and I think about her every day
This might not be love but this crush
Got me wanting to tell you today

[Chorus]
You're a diamond in the rough, dust you off, baby
I wanna make you shine for me
And if I can take you out, I'll show you off baby
I want the whole world to see
Your future looks so blind 'cause they say I'm a star
But you can carry your own light, shed some light on my heart
You're a diamond in the rough
I wanna make you shine for me, shine for me, shine for me
You're a diamond in the rough, dust you off, baby
I wanna make you shine for me
And if I can take you out, I'll show you off baby
I want the whole world to see
Your future looks so blind 'cause they say I'm a star
But you can carry your own light, shed some light on my heart
You're a diamond in the rough
I wanna make you shine for me, shine for me, shine for me
