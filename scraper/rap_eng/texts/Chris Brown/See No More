[Verse 1]
It was Saturday when I got that call
Far away from feeling tall
I know, I know, I know what the truth is, yeah
I tried to look away from what you did
Heartache became my friend

[Pre-Chorus]
You walked away from me, baby
I would've never done the same
You made me feel like our love was not real
You threw it all away, so

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait for you
I don't wanna wake up thinking, hoping
You'll get it right this time
'Cause you know that you’re so cold
I don't wanna see no more
And I can’t get away from you

[Post-Chorus]
It's one of the reasons why
That I just can't get you out my mind
And all I keep seein' is your picture
But I don't wanna see no more
But I don't wanna see no more
I don't wanna see no more
I don't wanna see no more
I don't wanna see no more

[Verse 2]
It was so easy to trust you, baby
Guess I was so stupid, baby
I didn't ever think that this would come
You’re running right to another one

[Pre-Chorus]
You walked away from me, baby
You threw it all away,(You threw it all away)
So

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait for you
I don't wanna wake up thinking, hopin'
You'll get it right this time
'Cause you know that you’re so cold
I don't wanna see no more
And I can’t get away from you

[Post-Chorus]
It's one of the reasons why
That I just can't get you out my mind
And all I keep seeing is your picture
But I don't wanna see no more (no more)
But I don't wanna see no more (no more)
I don't wanna see no more
I don't wanna see no more
I don't wanna see no more

[Bridge]
I used to be afraid of letting go
The fragile part me, I’m here right now
I need you to set me free
I can see it in your eyes
That you won’t blame on me this time
No, never
And I want you back but I won’t look back, no

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait for you
I don't wanna wake up thinking, hoping
You'll get it right this time
'Cause you know that you’re so cold
I don't wanna see no more
And I can’t get away from you

[Post-Chorus]
It's one of the reasons why
That I just can't get you out my mind
And all I keep seeing is your picture
But I don't wanna see no more
But I don't wanna see no more
I don't wanna see no more
I don't wanna see no more
I don't wanna see no more
