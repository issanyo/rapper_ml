[Verse 1]
Guess who's steppin' in the room
It's ya boy Breezy, hit 'em with the auto-tune
Automatic, systematic, robo dude
'Cause I want to
I'm the kinda guy that don't follow rules
So come on, baby girl, let's break a few
Well let me say this

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, are you sure you want to play with fire?
I'm guaranteed to take it higher
If you say you don't then you're a liar, yeah

[Chorus]
You don't want my number, baby, you don't want my math
I know what you want, I know what you want
You don't want no picture, baby, or no autograph
I know what you want, I know what you want
You want to hit it, hit it, hit it, smash
Hit it, hit it, hit it, smash
Hit it. hit it, hit it, smash

[Verse 2]
I know her game she all the same
I don't really wanna know her name
She went down town like a stock exchange
But all her friends kept cock blockin', man

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, are you sure you want to play with fire?
I'm guaranteed to take it higher
If you say you don't then you're a liar, yeah

[Chorus]
You don't want my number, baby, you don't want my math
I know what you want, I know what you want
You don't want no picture, baby, or no autograph
I know what you want, I know what you want
You want to hit it, hit it, hit it, smash
Hit it, hit it, hit it, smash
Hit it. hit it, hit it, smash
