[Intro: August Alsina]
I've been around, I've been around the world
I've been around, I've been around the world
I've been around, I've been around the world
I've been around, I've been around the world

[Verse 1: August Alsina]
First thing first, I'm Aug, freaks, all the honeys
Dummies, Playboy bunnies, hoes gettin' money
That's the one they like 'cause they only get the pipe
And if they act right, they might get to spend the night
These girlies wanna be with me
These hoes tryna trap a G, but I ain't with it
Money out there, nigga tryna get it
A lot them bitches tell me I be slippin', I admit it
Had my share of every kind of girl
But lately, this ain't what you need, not me, girl
'Cause you know they gon' hate on you
And they really gon' hate me too 'cause I'm too young, too honest 'bout it

[Chorus: August Alsina]
Been around the world and I, swear this shit been crazy
I don't know how, I don't why, I should choose one lady
Been around around the world and I, met the girls who get down
You should know I get around, when you fuckin' with a nigga like me, girl, I hope you see
I've been around, I've been around the world
I've been around, I've been around the world
I've been around, I've been around the world
I've been around, I've been around the world

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Baby girl, show me, what makes you different from them other girls
You must not know me, girl, I'm the best you ever had
So girl, don't you start running a game on me
Don't be listening to them weak niggas, a nigga rich, we taking trips, I spend a week with ya
Baby, now we on the beach, rolling in the sand
Go to Paris, I know you like France
You can bring your girls, ain't a lot of niggas
And I'ma end up grabbing your booty with both hands
Then you like, "Please, baby
Can we go somewhere one on one so you can put it on me, baby?"
Girl, I'ma put it down, you know I've been around
You get the dick 'cause I

[Chorus: August Alsina & Chris Brown]
Been around the world and I, man, this shit been crazy
I don't know how, I don't why, I should choose one lady
Been around around the world and I, met the girls who get down
You should know I get around, when you fuckin' with a nigga like me, girl, I hope you see
I've been around, I've been around the world
I've been around, I've been around the world
I've been around, I've been around the world
I've been around, I've been around the world
