[Verse 1]
Way too complicated
Oh, we don't need that now, no
Wasting time, frustrated
Oh, we don't need that, no

[Pre-Chorus]
You know you just stop and stare
Something special, baby
Why hold back, we're here now, babe?
I'm just putting it out there, yeah

[Chorus]
If you're down, I'm down (woah, ooh, na, na, yeah)
If you're down, I'm down (woah, ooh, na, na)
If you're down, I'm down

[Verse 2]
It ain't no hesitating
You're all I need now, girl, all I need is you (woah, woah)
Look no further, no complaining
You're all I need now, girl (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I just stop and stare
Something special, should be here
Why hold back, we're here now, babe?
I'm just throwing it out there, yeah (woo)

[Chorus]
If you're down, I'm down (huh, if you're down, woah, ooh, na, na)
If you're down, I'm down (down, woah, ooh, na, na, yeah)
If you're down, I'm down
Tell me if you're down, I'll be down for you, baby (hey, woah, yeah, huh, woah, huh, huh, huh)
Tell me if you're down, I'll be down for you, baby (hey, hey, woo, woah, yeah, woah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
All this beauty, girl, I love your fragrance
Something special to me
Why hold back, we're here now, baby?
I'm just throwing it out there

[Chorus]
If you're down, I'm down (if you're down, I'm down, woah, yeah)
If you're down, I'm down (I'm down, ooh, woah, yeah)
If you're down, I'm down
Tell me if you're down, I'll be down for you, baby (yeah, yeah, woah, hey, oh now, woah, oh, oh now)
Tell me if you're down, I'll be down for you, baby (you're down, woah, yeah, woah, huh, huh, yeah)
