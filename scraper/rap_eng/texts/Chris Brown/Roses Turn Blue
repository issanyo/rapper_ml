[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Girl, I double dare you to keep it all the way 100 with me if I'm your man
I'm not gon' lie, I'm scared too, I know you got something to tell me 'cause you're fucking up your speech
So baby, tell me where you were, I'm sick and tired, I know you saw me calling
I think our shit has been over, for a while now

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Feels so confused when you say that you don't need me, oh, woah
It's only you that's making you wanna leave me, oh
Where is this trust? I lost it, when you let 'em fuck, yeah, you did, yup
Said girl, I lost it, lost it, how could you give it up?

[Chorus: Tinashe]
I'm not going down with your love
I gave it my all but it's never enough (it's never enough)
Behind the roses, got your hand on the gun
I won't be the one going down with your love (down with your love)
I'm not going down, down, down
Down, down, down
I'm not going down, down, down
With your love

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
It's a cold place, doesn't even matter, it never did do anyway (it never did do anyway)
Turned an eye so blind, you stood there
While I dug myself a grave
Threw my heart inside, you didn't do a thing

[Chorus: Tinashe]
I'm not going down with your love
I gave it my all but it's never enough (it's never enough)
Behind the roses, got your hand on the gun
I won't be the one going down with your love (down with your love)
I'm not going down, down, down
Down, down, down
I'm not going down, down, down
With your love

[Bridge: Chris Brown & (Tinashe)]
Ooh, ooh, girl, yeah, you be on that other shit (but it's never enough)
Ooh, ooh, you be on that other shit

[Chorus: Tinashe]
I'm not going down with your love
I gave it my all but it's never enough (it's never enough)
Behind the roses, got your hand on the gun
I won't be the one going down with your love (down with your love)
I'm not going down, down, down
Down, down, down
I'm not going down, down, down
With your love
I'm not going down, down, down
Down, down, down
I'm not going down, down, down
With your love
