[Verse 1]
Why are my hands bleeding? I think I know why
I've been holding on to the words from your every lie, why?
Fool me once, shame on you, baby, fool me twice
Should have know that there would be problems girl with you, but I thought

[Pre-Chorus]
You were different, my baby
Now I see you're just like the rest
Thought you were different, my baby
You've become my biggest regret

[Chorus]
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
Stereotype, stere-stereotype
Stereotype, stere-stereotype
Stereotype, stere-stereotype
Stereotype, stere-stere-ere-ere-o

[Verse 2]
Can't blame you, you were only being yourself
I fell in love with someone that I barely knew, why?
Fool me once, shame on you, baby, fool me twice
Should have know that there would be problems girl with you but I thought

[Pre-Chorus]
You were different, my baby
Now I see you're just like the rest
Thought you were different, my baby
You've become my biggest regret

[Chorus]
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype

[Bridge]
Stere-stere-stereo, stereo, stereo
Girl, you ain't nothing but a stereo, nothing but a stereo
Stereotype, stere-stereotype
Stereotype, that's that stereo, stereo

[Pre-Chorus]
You were different, my baby
Now I see you're just like the rest
Thought you were different, my baby
You've become my biggest regret

[Chorus]
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
