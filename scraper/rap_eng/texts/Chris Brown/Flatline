[Verse 1]
Do I even got a pulse?
Am I empty, 'cause i gave my love away
It doesn't seem like you willin' to try
I think we're running out of time now
And I can hear the sirens
And all the caution tape wrapped around my body
Would you rather be happy with another?
Or maybe it's you that's undercover

[Pre-Chorus]
I never thought, that you would change my life
I would have left, if I had known the price
Tell me what am I waiting for
Electric shock won't help no more
Surgery before I fall apart
Get the jumper cables from my car
Baby, I need you to bring me back
Will you bring me back?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm trying not to think at all
I'm slipping, theres no-one to catch my fall
And I need you here, 'cause you're the air I breathe
And you're the only one for me
Baby, you're my Oxygen, so please let me breathe again
Or i'ma flatline

[Verse 2]
I don't know why you won't help me
And I know we argue, and we disagree
But this scent of your body, memories of our life
You decide to neglect, when the truth is there

[Pre-Chorus]
I never thought, that you would change my life
I would have left, if I had known the price
Tell me what am I waiting for
Electric shock won't help no more
Surgery before I fall apart
Get the jumper cables from my car
Baby, I need you to bring me back
Will you bring me back?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm trying not to think at all
I'm slipping, theres no-one to catch my fall
And I need you here, 'cause you're the air I breathe
And you're the only one for me
Baby, you're my Oxygen, so please let me breathe again
Or i'ma flatline

[Outro]
I'm trying not to think at all
I'm slipping, theres no-one to catch my fall
And I need you here, 'cause you're the air I breathe
And you're the only one for me
Baby, you're my Oxygen, so please let me breathe again
Or i'ma flatline
