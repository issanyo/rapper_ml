[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, won't you just listen?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Please

[Verse 1]
I never really thought I'd be sitting here all alone
Staring down at the phone
Damn, what did I do that was so wrong?
And girl, I never thought you would move on
Can't believe you're gone
It's killing me my heart ain't your home

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, thought I was the one but you done left me out
And now and now

[Chorus]
Now I can't say nothing
Now my everything done turned to nothing
Nothing, baby, what can I do? What can I say? Nothing
Wish I could've stopped you walking out, should have screamed out loud
Baby, can't you hear me?  Don't you diss me
'Cause I'm hurting, girl I wish that you could feel me
I guess there's nothing, wish that you would talk to me or something
You ain't saying nothing, no

[Verse 2]
I never even gave you one hundred percent
I never said what I meant, damn
Girl, I never thought you'd be burnt out, now my heart is breaking down
It's killing me, I can't save it and it's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, thought I was the one but you done left me out
And now and now

[Chorus]
Now I can't say nothing
Now my everything done turned to nothing
Nothing, baby, what can I do? What can I say? Nothing
Wish I could've stopped you walking out, should have screamed out loud
Baby, can't you hear me?  Don't you diss me
'Cause I'm hurting, girl I wish that you could feel me
I guess there's nothing, wish that you would talk to me or something
You ain't saying nothing, no

[Bridge]
One of the things I miss most is how you made me feel so right
And even though you're gone, I'm all alone, hey
I dream 'bout you day and night, day and night, I'm breaking down
Wishing my baby was next to me, can't you see? 'Cause I don't know who else to love

[Chorus]
Now I can't say nothing
Now my everything done turned to nothing
Nothing, baby, what can I do? What can I say? Nothing
Wish I could've stopped you walking out, should have screamed out loud
Baby, can't you hear me?  Don't you diss me
'Cause I'm hurting, girl I wish that you could feel me
I guess there's nothing, wish that you would talk to me or something
You ain't saying nothing, no
Now I can't say nothing
Now my everything done turned to nothing
Nothing, baby, what can I do? What can I say? Nothing
Wish I could've stopped you walking out, should have screamed out loud
