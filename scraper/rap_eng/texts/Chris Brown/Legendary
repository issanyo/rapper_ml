[Intro: Keyshia Cole & DJ Khaled]
You know, I've seen some things
(Keyshia Cole)
It's important to stay strong
(Chris Brown)
What's up DJ Khaled?
It's your girl KC
(Ne-Yo, legendary, let's go)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
If not they, then who
Will carry on the weight of this world?
If not they, then who
Will make sure all the people know how it feels to be legendary? (Get 'em)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Baby. don't cry no more
'Cause I'm here to show you the way
I know you got some fight in you, oh
So don't make losing so easy, oh, woah

[Pre-Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Everybody's gonna fight and everybody's gonna fall
But the ones that get up are always the strongest
Oh, I can't imagine if I never went through nothing
I wouldn't be a fighter and I wouldn't last the longest, no

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Keyshia Cole & DJ Khaled]
If not they, then who
Who will carry (Let's go), will carry on the weight of this world?
If not they, then who, then who (Come on)
Will make sure all the people know how it feels to be legendary? (Legendary)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown, Keyshia Cole & DJ Khaled]
Legends are born and created
And nothing's free, so I take it
It takes the determination
(We going in) Above, above, the nation

[Pre-Chorus: Keyshia Cole & Chris Brown]
Everybody's gonna fight and everybody's gonna fall
But the one's who get up (Get up) are always the strongest (Strongest)
Oh, I can't imagine if I (Yeah) never went through nothing (Nothing)
I wouldn't be a fighter (Oh, woah) and I wouldn't last the longest (Oh)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Keyshia Cole & DJ Khaled]
If not they, then who
Who will carry, will carry on the weight of this world?
If not they, then who
Will make sure all the people know how it feels to be legendary? (How it feels, We The Best!)

[Bridge: Ne-Yo & DJ Khaled]
Oh, on right now, I promise I'ma do it better than anybody's ever seen (Let's go)
In this battle, that I will be everything that everybody told me I would never be, no
Won't go down, got my feet on the ground, the wind at my back, my head to the sky
Won't stop now, no, not ever, you can see in my eyes, I will be legendary

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Keyshia Cole]
If not they, then who
Who will carry, will carry on the weight of this world?
If not they, then who
Will make sure all the people know how it feels to be legendary? (How it feels)

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
I remember when they told me no
I looked 'em right in their eyes and I told 'em yes
Don't let nobody stop your dreams
Keep winning, rise to the top
Keep your head up
Young world, the world is yours
We The Best, YMCMB
