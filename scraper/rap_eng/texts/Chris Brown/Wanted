[Verse 1]
Girl, everybody knows
The only thing I need from you is loving
I just need you to love me
I know I'm no Cassanova
If you give me a chance, I need a minute to rock your body
Oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
If you stay with me
A bit of Hennessy will fix this all
And have some fun
Oh, yeah
You with me
It's an emergency, dial 911
Dial 911

[Chorus]
Soon as I pick you up, I lay it down
Put my hands on you
We be loving 'til you tell me to stop
Oh, baby, baby
Body on your body
My lips all on your naughty parts
Now we're face to face

[Post-Chorus]
You can't run away from me
Girl, you're wanted
I'm 'bout to throw away the key
Girl, you got me
You know you can never leave
Good romacing, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Girl, I won't tell a soul
Just promise me you won't break my heart
Just show me you love me
I know I'm no Cassanova
But this bad boy still tryna figure out how she got me
Oh, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
If you stay with me
A bit of Hennessy will fix this all
And have some fun
Oh, yeah
You with me
It's an emergency, dial 911
Dial 911

[Chorus]
Soon as I pick you up, I lay it down
Put my hands on you
We be loving 'til you tell me to stop
Oh, baby, baby
Body on your body
My lips all on your naughty parts
Now we're face to face, ow!

[Post-Chorus]
You can't run away from me
Girl, you're wanted
I'm 'bout to throw away the key
Girl, you got me
You know you can never leave
Good romacing, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
