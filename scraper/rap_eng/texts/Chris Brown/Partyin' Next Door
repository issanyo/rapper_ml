[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Baby you be on that old shit
I don't need that commotion
Got me heated in the oven
Don't play with the chopper, it's fully loaded
Yeah, driving me crazy, driving me crazy
No one but you, I feel so used, set up
You supposed to be here in this foreign
But you just disappeared like I’m not important

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Eh, you're what I need, I need you
Heart on my sleeve, I need you
Oh, you know I need you
You fucked up cause you partying next door
You partying next door
You partying next door
You partying next door
Said you partying, yeah

[Verse 2: Young Blacc]
She got 4 friends, I hope they go
Double up and bring 4 more
Hennessy and the Patron shots
Make the white girls wanna get low
HoodyBaby, my kin folk and OHB, I kill for
That other party that's next door, we don't fuck with niggas that save hoe
Spanish chicks, they can take dick, black girls love to talk shit
White girls love the foreplay, handstand, make them turn tricks
She took my proposition 'bout the pimping
She know how to flip it, ain't come with interest
She telling a nosey nigga mind his business
Always hating cause they know we winning
Grown man shit, I don't need permission
I don't give a damn if they real sisters
Nigga, I only fuck with them freak hoes
Beast mode, eat the pussy

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Eh, you're what I need, I need you
Heart on my sleeve, I need you
Oh, you know I need you
You fucked up cause you partying next door
You partying next door
You partying next door
You partying next door
Said you partying, yeah

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Downgrade, don't feel the same
Got the nerve to say a nigga change, really?
Only motherfucker put you in a gang
How the hell you think they know your name? You trifling, you silly
But I keep hoes on deck, what you know 'bout me?
I’m the nigga takin fades, yelling OHB
Overhand biscuit, you ain't out my reach
Bitches wanna kiss dick every time I preach
Got the Staples Centre, floor seats
And it's 500 blocks with my OGs
A nigga did a lid in the county
A 100 million dollars, my niggas gon' eat
I stayed fresh, I don't need no stylist
I'm either mean or modest
I don't need co-pilots
OHB, we popping, nigga who gon' stop us?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Eh, you're what I need, I need you
Heart on my sleeve, I need you
Oh, you know I need you
You fucked up cause you partying next door
You partying next door
You partying next door
You partying next door
Said you partying, yeah
Eh, you're what I need, I need you
Heart on my sleeve, I need you
Oh, you know I need you
You fucked up cause you partying next door
