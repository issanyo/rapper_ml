She gon' be who she wanna be, I know she might up and leave
If I cheat, baby, please, listen, even shit blow up in chemistry
Tired of chasin' bitches, I'm a grown man
I need a woman, baby, here's the lease, your name is on it and I ain't bluffin'
She say she want some old school, K-Ci & Jojo
How does it feel? D'Angelo
Got me feeling on your booty, R. Kelly
And girl, I love that you're a freak
