[Verse 1: Andre Merritt]
I finally got the keys to my room
Now I'm going through my phone
I already know which one that I want
Bet it won't take that long
I bet he's still up in the club, hurry up
'Cause I'm here all alone
Waiting for ya
Getting ready for ya, boy

[Pre-Chorus: Andre Merritt]
Yeah, I'm looking real sexy wearing little fishnets
Now I want you but you're saying not yet
'Cause I'ma have you up all night
I'ma have you up all night, boy

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I plead tonight you're gonna get the key
It's just you and me, oh yeah
Let's go to the room and have a private party if you're with it
So we can take this up up up the elevator, elevator, yeah
