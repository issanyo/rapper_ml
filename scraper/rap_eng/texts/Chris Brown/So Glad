[Verse 1]
I'm finally fed up, with the run around chase and cut
So I hung my jersey up, turned in my playas card
The boy faced the facts, I'm a man now, done with that, finally learned how to act
And in fact it's cause of who you are, so glad that I found you

[Chorus]
So glad, so glad
So glad, I found you, baby, so glad that I found you
So glad, you made me, so glad, brand new yeah
So glad, baby I'm so glad that I found you

[Verse 2]
Hey, you caught me up, when I stop, you start me up
When a brother got low, got me up and I'd be up, stuck girl, girl hook me up
And not to be cliche but I'm the Clyde to your Bonnie
My good day, just the way you do, makes me so damn glad that I found you

[Chorus]
So glad, so glad
So glad, I found you, baby, so glad that I found you
So glad, you made me, so glad, brand new
So glad, baby I'm so glad that I found you

[Bridge]
I love the way that you care for me honey
I love the fact that you're there for me honey
And I ain't going nowhere from you, trust me
Now that I got you baby
I love the way that you care for me honey
I love the fact that you're there for me honey
And I ain't going nowhere from you, trust me
Now that I've found you baby

[Chorus]
So glad, so glad, I'm so glad
Oh I'm so glad, so glad, so glad
Now that I've found you, I'm brand new, so glad
Baby I'm so glad that I found you, so glad
I'm so glad I've found her, I'm so glad I got you
So glad, so glad, I'm so glad, so glad
Baby, eh, baby, so glad, so glad
Baby I'm so glad that I found you
