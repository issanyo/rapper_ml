[Verse 1]
What you wanna do, baby? Where you wanna go?
I'll take you to the moon, baby, I'll take you to the floor
I'll treat you like a real lady, no matter where you go
Just give me some time, baby, 'cause you know

[Pre-Chorus]
Even when we're apart I know my heart is still there with you
Five more hours 'til the night is ours and I am back with you

[Chorus]
This right here is my type of party
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Five more hours, we're just getting started
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This right here is my type of party
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Five more hours, we're just getting started
Five more hours, we're just getting started

[Verse 2]
How you wanna feel, baby? What you wanna know?
Just pour another drink, baby, come on pour a little more
I'll treat you like a real lady, I'll keep you up to code
I'll give you all my time, baby, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
Even when we're apart I know my heart is still there with you
Five more hours 'til the night is ours and I am back with you, this is, yeah

[Chorus]
This right here is my type of party
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
I follow the sound of your heartbeat
How it always calls me, finding my way back to you
I'm feeling it more now than ever
I'll do this forever, just to spend a night with you, this is, yeah

[Chorus]
This right here is my type of party
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (oh, yeah, yeah)
Five more hours, we're just getting started
