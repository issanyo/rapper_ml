[Intro]
Young love, love, love, oh, a teenage love
Young love, love, yeah, a teenage love
Young love, young love, everything I need, I got in my young love
A teenage love, young love, young love girl, a teenage love

[Verse 1]
Tell me what's the definition of love? It seems like everybody thinks they done figured it out but
Every time they fall up in it, they fall out, in and out it again
Tell me how they gonna know about us, telling me and you that we ain't even been around long enough
We can prove 'em wrong, show 'em how it's done, I know that we can do it

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause it's wilding out, we got that, and forgiving, we got that
If it's talking 'bout how we feeling, we got that
If it's hanging out, keeping it real then we got that
Me and you know what the deal is but

[Chorus]
Since we ain't 21
They be tryna say it ain't love
Cause we can't hit the clubs
They be tryna say we too young
I ain't saying that we tryna be grown
I'm just saying that we're old enough to know
We got that young love, young love
We lucky cause we got that young love

[Verse 2]
It's crazy how all our friends say, that we gone, they still tryna figure us out babe
Cause we always together and we don't gotta front, we ain't gotta pretend girl
And you know a couple of 'em gon' hate, talk behind your back, smile up in your face
Oh girl we can prove 'em wrong and show 'em how it's done and girl I know that we can do it just because

[Pre-Chorus]
If we're wilding out, we got that, forgiving, we got that
If it's talking 'bout how we feeling, we got that
Just hanging out, keep it real then we got that
Me and you know what the deal is but

[Chorus]
Since we ain't 21
They be tryna say it ain't love
Cause we can't hit the clubs
They be tryna say we too young
I ain't saying that we tryna be grown
I'm just saying that we're old enough to know
We got that young love, young love
We lucky cause we got that young love

[Bridge]
We can hit a show, kick it on the block, everywhere we go
You know that we got that young love, young love, young love
Just talking on the phone or laying at the spot, no matter what we do
You know they can't stop that young love, young love, young love, you're my young love baby

[Chorus]
Since we ain't 21
They be tryna say it ain't love
Cause we can't hit the clubs
They be tryna say we too young
I ain't saying that we tryna be grown
I'm just saying that we're old enough to know
We got that young love, young love
We lucky cause we got that young love

[Outro]
Young love, young love
Everything I need I got in my young love, young love
Well it's my young love, young love
Everything I want I got in my young love, young love
Young love, young love
Everything I need I got in my young love, young love
Well it's my young love, young love
Everything I want I got in my young love, young love
