[Verse 1]
Promise I'm not cocky, I just know I can fuck you right
Give me the time of day, babe
And I'm gon' make it last all night with you
Yeah, that's all I wanna do, aw yeah

[Bridge]
Baby, I don't know what you put on, no
Girl, I'm gonna take it off, go, so you might as well come naked

[Verse 2]
Showed up naked, I ain't playin', girl, I'm with this shit
Answer the door, say hello and then put my face in it
Drop to your knees just like I'm the one you're prayin' with
'Cause you said you can take it, take it off
I wanna see that, put your feet up
Baby, I ain't talkin' relax
Tryna head to the spot, where the G at?
She addicted to the D, every night it's a relapse

[Pre-Chorus]
My baby's coming over
We don't even need no foreplay
Even when we sober
We get drunk off love and then sex all day

[Chorus]
Sip to this, oh I
Let's take a sip to this
Baby, turn up
Sip to this, let's take a sip to this
'Cause then we gon' fuck to this
Oh yeah, you know you love the shit
Baby, turn up

[Verse 3]
Normally I'm patient but I need all of you right now (now)
Please don't keep me waiting
I've been waiting to lay you down (lay you down)
Lay you down, lay you down, right now, oh yeah

[Bridge]
I don't know what you put on
'cause I'm gonna take it off, so you might as well come naked

[Verse 4]
You look better with no clothes on anyway (huh, yeah)
Never let the pride of the panties get up in the way (no)
Pull 'em to the side, let you ride like the interstate (ooh)
'Cause you said you could take it, take it off (you could take it off)
Make it disappear now, like you doing a magic show
And we leaving scratches like animals
I'm off that poison, don't give me no antidote (my bad)

[Pre-Chorus]
My baby's coming over (ooh)
We don't even need no foreplay (no, no, no, woah)
Even when we sober
We get drunk off love and then sex all day (I think we should take a sip to this)

[Chorus]
Sip to this, oh I
Let's take a sip to this (why don't you go and turn up)
Baby, turn up (yeah, yeah)
Sip to this, let's take a sip to this (yeah, come on)
'Cause then we gon' fuck to this (oh babe, oh babe, oh yeah, you)
Oh yeah, you know you love the shit
So, baby, turn up

[Outro]
Sip to this (uh-huh)
I just want to kiss on you (uh-huh, ooh)
Wanna put my lips on you (uh-huh)
Baby, you know how we do
Baby, turn up (yeah)
Sip to this, sippin' (huh)
We be sippin', let's take a sip to this
Sippin', sippin' (yeah, huh)
