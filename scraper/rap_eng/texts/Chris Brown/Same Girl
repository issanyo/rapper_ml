[Verse 1]
My head it's killing me
I'm losing sleep
And I'm waking up tired of it all
Early in the morning
And it's starting already
Why my name always involved?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tryna get rid of the baggage
Fake friends I call them "has-been"s
Yeah, they lying on stuff
And I don't care if you don't show me love, no
They want me to lie down
They want me to crawl, uh-uh, uh-uh
They want me to cry now, uh-uh, uh-uh
But I'm never falling off

[Chorus]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
'Cause in the end I'm still the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl), same girl (same girl)
I'm just the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl), same girl (same girl)

[Verse 2]
Tell me what I gotta do
I'm tryna make it clear to you
Not dealing with the attitude
I'm tired of tryna make you see that I'm still me
Switched up my longitude and latitude
You're in my way, you better move
Ignoring everyone that's tryna bring me down
Oh baby, oh baby

[Pre-Chorus]
They want me to lie down
They want me to crawl, uh-uh, uh-uh
They want me to cry now, uh-uh, uh-uh
But I'm never falling off

[Chorus]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
'Cause in the end I'm still the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl), same girl (same girl)
I'm just the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl), same girl (same girl)

[Verse 3]
Tell me what I gotta do
I'm tryna make it clear to you Not dealing with the attitude I'm tired of tryna make you see that I'm still me Switched up my longitude and latitude
You're in my way, you better move
Knowing everyone is tryna bring me down
Oh baby, oh baby

[Bridge]
They want me to lock down
They want me to crawl
They want me to cry now
But I'm never falling off

[Chorus]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
'Cause in the end I'm still the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl), same girl (same girl)
I'm just the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl), same girl (same girl)

[Bridge]
I haven't changed but you're telling me that I did
I'm still the same girl that I was

[Chorus]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
'Cause in the end I'm still the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl), same girl (same girl)
I'm just the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl), same girl (same girl)
