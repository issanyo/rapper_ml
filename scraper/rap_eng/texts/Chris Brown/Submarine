[Verse 1]
Running back and forth in my head tryna figure out
How could I let a girl go so perfect, fellas you know what I'm talking 'bout
And I've been thinking about it what you said, screaming how you want me out
And then I turn around and look at your pics and all I think about

[Pre-Chorus]
Is the way we used to kiss
Is the way you held my hand
Is the way we used to dance
How we show romance, give me one more chance

[Chorus]
Was it all my fault?
Sorry for the pain I caused
With no love involved
Do I cross your mind at all?
With all the love I gave
That make me feel this way
At anytime of the day
Do I cross your mind at all?

[Verse 2]
It's a shame that we can't at least talk about our problems
My heart's broken and my body is starving
For your love and I need you in my life, girl
For your touch and all I think about is

[Pre-Chorus]
Is the way we used to kiss (I miss kissing, baby)
Is the way you held my hand
Is the way we used to dance
How we show romance, give me one more chance

[Chorus]
Was it all my fault?
Sorry for the pain I caused
With no love involved
Do I cross your mind at all?
With all the love I gave
That make me feel this way
At anytime of the day
Do I cross your mind at all?

[Bridge]
Wait, girl, you hear your conscience calling, all in
Wait, girl, come back to me I need you here, baby
Stay, girl, baby, I want you to stay around
For me girl, I'm sorry, baby

[Chorus]
Was it all my fault?
Sorry for the pain I caused
With no love involved
Do I cross your mind at all?
With all the love I gave
That make me feel this way
At anytime of the day
Do I cross your mind at all?

[Outro]
At all, at all, at all
Do I cross your mind at all?
Girl, do I cross your mind at all?
