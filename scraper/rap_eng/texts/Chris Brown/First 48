[Intro]
Like a circus freak, alright, where that beat go?
Okay, leggo

[Verse 1]
Look, gon' make ‘em clap, make 'em do that
And when this nigga rap, they be like “Who that?”
She in the party super wet, where the pool at?
I got a big head, so my hat adjust to two snaps
Money to the ceiling, tell me where my roof at
Your pants too tight, maybe you just too fat
Just a Cheetoh with Doritos, yeah, I lay 'em like du-rags
Boy, I know why you mad, cause my chain stupid
And your girl leaning all on me
I'mma give her a couple of drinks, and then I put her ass to sleep
Bedtime, if she come she a freak
Then you read them headlines that she fucking with CB
What you mean? I'mma ball out
I'm driving space ships, I threw my cars out
What I call a garage, you call a house
Live in that hole in the wall, you are a mouse
They be like “Chris, you killing it” Soprano
Valet tryna steal my keys, nigga this ain't no piano
What you mean? I'm the president, but fuck a bout a panel?
They gonna have to change the channel, 'cause it’s way too much to handle
Yep, haha all that bullshit, I ain’t hearing it
Cause I'm on point, like a pyramid
And I'm flushing you turds, killing shit
Only hear two words, nigga sick
Yeah, I'm the B-E-S-T-E-S-T
I'm in that Range, you in that low key
Off that super loud, the car smoking, but it's Friday
What up Smokey?
Damn, man all these cameras are bananas
And the waitress hate me, hope she don't spit in my sandwich
Yeah, y'all can't get at me like a mention
Indirectly, y'all respect me, because this boy in detention
But still I walk around too proud
Neighbours mad at me, 'cause I fuck too loud
You would think I was police, how I move crowds
Neighbours mad at me, 'cause I fuck too loud
Team Breezy, yeah I'm repping it
We the shit boy, so don't step in it
I'm all about my stripes, like a veteran
And it's getting too late, I need to take my medicine
Okay, okay let me go
Nigga be shining, and oh soul glow
Boy, look at all these diamonds
And my chain so heavy, and my neck be whining
Can't see you, all I see is my shades
Girl, got her giddy giddy, Frankie Lymon
I make her cum like clockwork
What you call that? Perfect timing
They call me Hercules, just like a slave, she working me
Know she off that bong weed, when she smoking and got them purple leaves
7-Eleven head, no hands when she slurping me
Then she swallowed my sword, like a circus freak
