[Chorus]
Wanna be a big boy, all these fancy cars
I want a supermodel, take her to the bar
Wanna have a diamond ring brighter than the stars
Wanna take over the world, just the start
I'm gonna try every girl but first, we're winning

[Verse 1]
She says how you don't know where you're going and where you headed
Just hope you hold the moment and there is no speed limit
It's better with your feet off the ground, you'll feel it once you're in it
It's time to let it go, was once a child now I'm a grown man

[Chorus]
Wanna be a big boy, all these fancy cars
I want a supermodel, take her to the bar
Wanna have a diamond ring brighter than the stars
Wanna take over the world, just the start
I'm gonna try every girl but first, we're winning

[Verse 2]

[Chorus]
Wanna be a big boy, all these fancy cars
I want a supermodel, take her to the bar
Wanna have a diamond ring brighter than the stars
Wanna take over the world, just the start
I'm gonna try every girl but first, we're winning

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Wanna be a big boy, all these fancy cars
I want a supermodel, take her to the bar
Wanna have a diamond ring brighter than the stars
Wanna take over the world, just the start
I'm gonna try every girl but first, we're winning
