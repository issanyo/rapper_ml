[Verse 1: Berner]
Bust a couple bands, blow my 100 fast
I just made a 100 off a 50 pack
Where them bad Asian bitches holdin' down my city at?
Where them girls from the A with that pretty face?
Round thing, I'm on that loud thang
Pop another bottle, shootin' corks at the crowd, dang
Yeah, I'm a stunna, but nah, I ain't Baby though
Young dude with the lazy flow, watch all these ladies go
Crazy when I pull up right beside em
I do a buck 30, yeah I'm just sittin' there flyin'
I smell like dirty money, plus this cookie that I'm lightin'
Big bucket's full of ice with bottles on fire inside 'em, uh

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T]
Call 'em Yoko Ono, Ono, Ono
Only ride solo, solo, solo
Mission for the dolo, dolo, dolo
One look in her eyes, she'll eat you alive
She a man eater, ski mad diva
She might up and leave you 'cause you can never leave her
You ain't never had someone, you can never keep her
Trickin' on the next man, he can't have her either, call her Yoko Ono

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Look, got a boatload of them Asian hoes
On vacation steady bakin' with Jamaican hoes
I got cash boy, I don't care what you makin' hoe
50 thousand on my wrist, I'm feedin' eskimos
Damn, put VA on this shit
Buy 100 fuckin' bottles, let 'em spray in this bitch
My money flow real long, I do relays in this bitch
And you know I kill songs, it's Burner, CB and Wiz, alrighty now
Ha, look at me, Ros√©, I'm on nigga
15 grand on a what? That's just my phone, nigga
Northern California, them blunts look like cones, nigga
Two up, two down, make that switch, yeah, it's Breezy, bitch

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Shades on, Polo white T
Me leavin' here alone? That's unlikely
Not a stoner bitch, but she like me
Tryna get that final cut like Spike Lee
I jack them hoes, direct them hoes, take 'em home
And let them hoes go live out their fantasies, they're poppin' pills, I'm rollin' weed
Even got a couple bad bitches overseas
Out the back 'cause ain't no tags when I'm shoppin'
And my bag filled with options so don't ask what it cost
I'm in a Maserati coupe goin' so fast that I lost 'em
And my bitch got so much swag that these bad bitches on us
Ah, killin' y'all, blaow, dag get a coffin, uh
