[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah
Polow, Polow
Cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah
Young 4, young 6, young gangstas
Cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I don't really do this much, but baby girl, I might
Fly you, buy you crazy things, that's 'cause you're the type I like
Cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah, go get that girl right there
Cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah, go get that girl right there

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Do you know who I am?
Baby girl, my name the shit
I'm the shit, yeah, the shit
Gucci Mane off in this bitch
When I spit stupid swift
I feel like I got a gift
Leave the truck 'bout forty thousand
But this one is on the strength
A balloon to a blimp
Ladies ask me do I pimp?
'Cause I walk with a limp
So much ice you feel a drift
Light a spliff, take a whiff
If you feel like take a sniff
Drink a fifth, pop a what?
One of those then plead the fifth
40K on a Wednesday, catch me in the M
Look at me, look at them, don't I look better than him?
Girl, my rims match my gems, pinky same color my wheels
And my drop top match my ears, no flaugin' I keep it real

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & (Chris Brown)]
I don't really do this much, but baby girl, I might
Fly you, buy you crazy things, that's 'cause you're the type I like
Cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah, go get that girl right there
Cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah, go get that girl right there
I don't really do this much, but baby girl, I might
Fly you, buy you crazy things, that's 'cause you're the type I like
Cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah, go get that girl right there (ha, yeah)
Cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah, go get that girl right there (leggo, I told you niggas, look)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
They done fucked around and let me back on my G shit
My wheels big, they deep dish (*barks*)
Engine bigger than a motherfucker
But on the dashboard you see fish (right)
See-through, all blue
I'm bigger than a barracuda, fuck you (hahaha)
Whole bunch of niggas in my clique, they gorillas
And I'm fuckin' with the motherfuckin' dogs too (*barks*)
All this money, I done met my quota
Yeah, I'm ballin', bitch (ha)
Flow sick, track ebola (ugh), Polow this that shit
For all the ladies, you know this that dick (yeah)
Hold up, wait a minute (brap!) Did he just say that? Yes, I did
And now open your legs up, let me show you this business
Microphones, I blaze, boy
Any little beat, any track I'll kill it
Fuckin' a model straight Playboy
I stick my ding-a-ling down they throat like ribbit
Got girls in the club with their lace front swingin' (ha)
Lookin' at my girl like, "No, you didn't" (uh-huh)
Somebody better call 911
With all this motherfuckin' pussy I'm killin'

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & (Lil Wayne)]
I don't really do this much, but baby girl, I might (might)
Fly you, buy you crazy things, that's 'cause you're the type I like (like)
Cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah, go get that girl right there (yeah)
Cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah, go get that girl right there
I don't really do this much, but baby girl, I might

Cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah, go get that girl right there

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, stay in line, hoe
Yeah, get your mind right, bitch
Yeah, all pussy ain't good pussy
And I don't like bald pussy, I like wolf pussy
My woman fuck me good and make kush cookies
Pockets on Snookie, I wouldn't fuck Snookie, hmm
I skate hard and fuck a bitch harder, shawty got a donk, call her Vince Carter
Eat a red bone, like red velvet cake
Fuck a nigga wife, and eat the weddin' cake
And if that nigga trippin', tell him yellow tape
I'm like 5'6", dick 7-8

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & (Lil Wayne)]
I don't really do this much, but baby girl, I might (Tunechi)
Fly you, buy you crazy things, that's 'cause you're the type I like (that right)
Cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah, go get that girl right there (that girl right there)
Cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah, go get that girl right there (Young Mula, baby)
I don't really do this much, but baby girl, I might
Fly you, buy you crazy things, that's 'cause you're the type I like

Cyeah cyeah cyeah cyeah, go get that girl right there
