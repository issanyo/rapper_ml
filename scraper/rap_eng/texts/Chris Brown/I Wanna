[Chorus]
She turned on by the way
She got that Coke bottle shape, (yeah) somethin' 'bout her face
She from 'round the way
She wanna go to my place, wanna know how it taste

[Verse 1]
Baby girl, you know you fine, fine
Never late, you're on time, time
Tear that pussy up, mine, mine
Tonight
Get it, pop your chest, it's Mardi Gras
Couple, couple bags Yves Saint Laurent
Shoes, just to feed your appetite
I-I-I

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you don't need the sun to see it rise (oh)
Ain't no need to lie
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna (go)
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna (yeah, go)
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
Go, yeah

[Chorus]
She turned on by the way
She got that Coke bottle shape, yeah, somethin' 'bout her face
She from 'round the way (way)
She wanna go to my place, wanna know how it taste

[Verse 2]
Listen, babe, I know you right, right
You keep on giving me the high, yeah
You and I gon' light a fire
Tonight
Baby girl, don't change your mind, mind
Why we here just dancin' all night
This Patr√≥n got her lit and she like
I-I-I

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you don't need the sun to see it rise (oh)
Ain't no need to lie
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna (go)
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna (yeah, go)
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
Go, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm turned on by the way, yeah
She got that Coke bottle shape, yeah, somethin' 'bout her face
She from 'round the way, yeah
She wanna go to my place, wanna know how it taste

[Bridge]
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna (I wanna, I wanna)
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna (I wanna, I wanna)
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, yeah, yeah
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, girl, you don't need the sun to see it rise (oh, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need to lie

[Chorus]
She turned on by the way (oh)
She got that Coke bottle shape, yeah, somethin' 'bout her face (baby, oh)
She from 'round the way (I wanna)
She wanna go to my place, wanna know how it taste (I wanna)
