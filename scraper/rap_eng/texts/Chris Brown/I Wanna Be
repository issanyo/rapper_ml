[Intro]
Look, I know we've been friends for a while now
But, I just feel like I can confess to you, it's annoymous
It's gonna be hard but
Alright here it goes

[Verse 1]
Imagine that the pillow that you cried on was my chest
And the tissue that you wiped your face with was my hand
Girl imagine if you needed advice about some other guy
I'm the one that comes to mind
Not tryna hear you tell nobody that I’m just a friend
Just tryna make sure I’m that body that you call your man
And any time you need a shoulder
It's yours, night or day, but what I’m tryna say is

[Chorus]
I wanna be the last number that you call at night
Said I wanna be the first one that you dial when you open your eyes
Wanna be the one you run to, wanna be the one that ain't gon' hurt you
I wanna be yeah, wanna be yeah
Be the man making your girls jealous, girl I wanna be
Be the guy shutting down all the fellas
Whatever you need, girl it's all on me
Your soldier, your friend or your lover, girl I wanna be

[Verse 2]
Would it be cool? Would you mind if I called you my boo?
What if the next whip you was pushing was the one I bought for you?
Can I be the one that meets your pops and take your mama shopping?
Be the only one they like
Wait, have you thought about it, wait, really thought about it?
Maybe you should take some time, call your girls and talk about it, yeah
Cause I done already made up my mind
Don't need no more time to know if I wanna be with you

[Chorus]
I wanna be the last number that you call at night
Said I wanna be the first one that you dial when you open your eyes
Wanna be the one you run to, wanna be the one that ain't gon' hurt you
I wanna be yeah, wanna be yeah
Be the man making your girls jealous, I wanna
Be the guy shutting down all the fellas
Whatever you need, girl it's all on me
Your soldier, your friend or your lover, girl I wanna be

[Bridge]
Put me on your screen saver, all over your MySpace
And make me one of your top favourites, that's where I wanna be
The one you crying for, stand up for and fight for
Wanna be your good, bad, love, hate girl
Cross my heart, hope to die on everything that's good
I'mma do you right, show you right, get this understood
Cross my heart, hope to die on everything that's good
I'mma do you right, show you right, get this understood

[Chorus]
I wanna be the last number that you call at night
The first one that you dial when you open your eyes
Wanna be the one you run to, wanna be the one that ain't gon' hurt you
I wanna be yeah, wanna be yeah
Be the man making your girls jealous, yeah
Be the guy shutting down all the fellas
Whatever you need, girl it's all on me
Your soldier, your friend or your lover, girl I wanna be yours

[Outro]
Girl I wanna be, I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
I wanna be, I wanna be, be yours
