[Intro]
My love, my love, my love
What would I do without my love?
My love, my love, my love

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been sensing there's some problems going on with us, yeah, you and I
And baby that's a problem I take real serious, I can't lie
It gets to me, I don't know what to do but to tell you that I love you
And you know this cause I'll show it, outsiders try to blow it but I can't let it happen no

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's business ain't nobody's business
In other words they don't know half of what I go through
To give you what you need
To be there for you and still do my thing
I'm talking 'bout music
Cause it's what I gotta do to express how I really feel
See you write the songs girl and I'll just do the singing
Without you I can't live, so heart to heart

[Chorus]
Baby heart to heart
Baby you're the biggest part of my needs, girl
They can tell their stories
What you do for me, it gets too deep, girl
What I'd do for you, you'll never know
What they say to you, girl let him go
You don't need him, you'd be better off hanging out with me
They try to break us up, they don't understand our love cause it gets too deep, girl

[Verse 2]
Check me, I know a way to make a bunch of people love me, if you were to leave me all by myself
As soon as we turn our way back they hustle out to tell someone else what's going on
Misery likes company but we're the only company we need to be happy
And you know this cause I'll show it, outsiders try to blow it but I can't let it happen no

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's business ain't nobody's business
In other words they don't know half of what I go through
To give you what you need
To be there for you and still do my thing
I'm talking 'bout my music
Cause it's what I gotta do to express how I really feel
See you write the songs girl and I'll just do the singing
Without you I can't live, so heart to heart

[Chorus]
Baby heart to heart
Baby you're the biggest part of my needs, girl
They can tell their stories
What you do for me, it gets too deep, girl
What I'd do for you, you'll never know
What they say to you, girl let him go
You don't need him, you'd be better off hanging out with me
They try to break us up, they don't understand our love cause it gets too deep, girl

[Bridge]
Check me, my love, my love, my love
What would I do, what would I do without my love?
Without your loving in my life? I don't know
My love, my love, my love, without you I can't live, it ain't no it way
My love, my love, my love, you're the only one I need in order to be happy
What would I do without my love? Don't you ever leave me
My love, my love, my love
Without you I can't live, so heart to heart

[Chorus]
Baby heart to heart
Baby you're the biggest part of my needs, girl
They can tell their stories
What you do for me, it gets too deep, girl
What I'd do for you, you'll never know
What they say to you, girl let him go
You don't need him, you'd be better off hanging out with me
They try to break us up, they don't understand our love cause it gets too deep, girl
