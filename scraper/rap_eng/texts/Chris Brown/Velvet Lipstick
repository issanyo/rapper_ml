[Verse 1: Andre Merritt]
Lonely night, lonely night
I think I want some rough love
Taking me over, taking me over
The kiss on my lips, a touch, touch
Should I listen to my heart again
Or just give in, or just give in

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain't gonna leave 'til you give it to me
I've got my velvet lipstick on, on
And I can't let you leave 'til I get what I need
Kiss me, kiss me, just kiss me

[Verse 2: Andre Merritt]
Jump out a plane, don't seem too far
I'm sure you'll land on my heart
Take me to paradise, hop in the car
Fireworks, baby, sparks, sparks
A rare breed, of loving, seduction
Feed my appetite, tonight
When I breathe, you feel my lips, it gives you chills
You've never had a kiss like this tonight

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain't gonna leave 'til you give it to me
I've got my velvet lipstick on, on
And I can't let you leave 'til I get what I need
Kiss me, kiss me, just kiss me

[Bridge: Andre Merritt]
Lonely night, a rare breed
Fireworks, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain't gonna leave 'til you give it to me
I've got my velvet lipstick on, on
And I can't let you leave 'til I get what I need
Kiss me, kiss me, just kiss me
Just kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Just kiss me
I ain't gonna leave 'til you give it to me
I've got my velvet lipstick on, on
And I can't let you leave 'til I get what I need
Kiss me, kiss me, just kiss me tonight
