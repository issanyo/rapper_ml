[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again, when I see you again
I'll see you again
Know I'll see you again
I'll see you again
My friend, where it all began

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, lookin' back now, know you hear me, wanna see me smile
Hold me down, keep me safe, when I'm down, not a sound
Ever since you was a child, always had your back 'til now
Should've kept the circle round, now it's like you're not around
Used to run it through the town, toughest little dudes around
Always thought you had a daughter, sure to teach her what they taught us
Had a son, he gettin' smarter, every day more like his father
Know this game and keep it solid, present faith, you know you got it
Big things come back again but ain't the same
I tell myself, "Remain the same and keep it sane"
Know it's hard when your dog ain't there to bark with ya
Seems like yesterday we was all in pictures

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again, when I see you again

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feelin' strong
And what's small, turned to a friendship, friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own, when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
How could we not talk about family, when family's all that we got?
Everythin' I went through, you were standin' there by my side and now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again, when I see you again
