[Intro]
Check this out, girl
I know you sitting back there saying to yourself
I know he ain't tryna holla, nah
But it's something I gotta tell ya
Aw yeah, aw yeah and it got to do with love
And I just want you to sit back and listen
While I sing this song to you
Check me, listen

[Verse 1]
It's like the hardest thing for me to say
Without cracking a smile
It's something that we both really feel inside
But never talked about
They call it love, oh yes, they do
A dangerous thing when you're part of the game
So, girl, I feel you when you get emotional and don't wanna let me go
Ha, but it's something I gotta tell ya

[Chorus]
Don't mean to cut you off but the question is
So when you gon' be my girl? When you gon' be my girl?
I wanna know when it comes to loving why you change the subject
You should know, girl you know that I'm the man you want, oh yes I am
Girl, what's really good with ya?
So when you gon' be my girl? When you gon' be my girl?
All this playing around is getting old now
So baby, tell me where I stand

[Verse 2]
I know, you prolly saying to yourself this brother tripping
But this stuff is real
But ain't too many fellas would have the nerve to step up
And tell that lady what's up to let her know he's really pressed
Now getting straight to the bottom line, you're the type
Of kinda girl a gangsta needs by his side
So when you get emotional, I won't let you go
It's something I gotta tell you

[Chorus]
Don't mean to cut you off but the question is
So when you gon' be my girl? When you gon' be my girl?
I wanna know when it comes to loving why you change the subject
You should know, girl you know that I'm the man you want, oh yes I am
So girl, what's really good with ya?
So when you gon' be my girl?
All this playing around is getting old now
So baby, where do I stand? Tell me, girl
I don't mean to be rude but I gotta know
So when you gon' be my girl? When you gon' be my girl?
I wanna know when it comes to loving why you change the subject
You should know, girl you know that I'm the man you want, I am the man you need
So girl, what's really good with ya?
So when you gon' be my girl?
All this playing around is getting old now
So baby, tell me where I stand
