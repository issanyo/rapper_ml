[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I'm the type of guy to supersize your life and turn it all around
Up and down, round and round, with me there's no backing down
So take some time to get to know me, I ain't acting phoney
Hop inside my ship and we can take off
And I just wanna keep your heart from getting colder
Whenever you get down, I say I'll be here like I told ya
Balengiaca shoes or Louis scarf up on your shoulder
Would you like?
To be treated like a princess, girl you wear the crown
You can lay up on my headrest, while I take you down
Girl, let me, let me give it to you, let me do it now
You the baddest thing I've seen and baby girl, you make me proud
You make me wanna be your man
I'll do the best that I can
Pleasure P, my nigga Bow
Know what I'm talking 'bout

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, I'm on you like a tattoo
Teach ya, I'm your class room
He is not me, we are not the same
And if I could see your face then
I just might get wasted
I don't even drink alcohol
But baby girl, I can't let you go
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
Never let you go
I can't let you go
Never letting go
Never letting go

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
Okay, ya man ain't nothin' like me
He do you wrong and treat you bad
Lil mama you just might be
The one that I been waitin' on
And I could be ya Bobby
And you my tenderoni
When you feelin' lonely, girl
All you gotta do, baby is phone me
And I be right with you, all I got is this picture
Of you and I, look at it any time that I miss you
And when I'm not with ya, my days are so cloudy
I be goin' through it tough when my baby not around me
And you could call me selfish, you can't be nobody else's
And I ain't lyin' when I tell you I ain't even felt this
Way before, was good to know she would ride or die for sure
I got plenty of bread so you ain't gotta worry 'bout the dough
And now you miss us wow
G's on the luggage, now you travellin' in style
Don't I make it look easy?
Lamborghini Moss with Lamborghini Breezy

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, I'm on you like a tattoo
Teach ya, I'm your class room
He is not me, we are not the same
And if I could see your face then
I just might get wasted
I don't even drink alcohol
But baby girl, I can't let you go
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
Never let you go
I can't let you go
Never letting go
Never letting go

[Bridge: Pleasure P]
Come get this pleasure
Shawty, sing about this pleasure
I ain't ever felt nobody like you
You all that and shawty, you the truth
And I really got some things I wanna do with you
Let me show them to ya
I'ma kiss ya body, you know what I wanna do
Rubbing on ya, kissing on ya
Touching on you, girl

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, I'm on you like a tattoo
Teach ya, I'm your class room
He is not me, we are not the same
And if I could see your face then
I just might get wasted
I don't even drink alcohol
But baby girl, I can't let you go
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
Never let you go
I can't let you go
Never letting go
Never letting go
