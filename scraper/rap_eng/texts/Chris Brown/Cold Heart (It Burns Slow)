[Verse 1]
If your lips could kill
They might charge you for murder, for the shit you did
On this battlefield, you won’t see no white flag, you ain’t have to quit

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the highs and lows
Girl I’m so in to you
Heart made of glass, so I see right through you
It was all jokes, until you laughed at what was true
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

[Chorus]
When your heart turns cold
It's like sparking a cigarette
It burn slow
Now you’re heartless, so
It's like taking shots to the head
It burn slow
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Feel That fire burn slow
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

[Verse 2]
It ain't nothing like a pretty one
It was, even if it wasn’t
I'm seeing through the lies
Now I think I’m on a stop
Nightmares playing in my head
Of you walking out on me
You created whats coming out of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the highs and lows
Girl I’m so in to you
Heart made of glass, so I see right through you
It was all jokes, until you laughed at what was true
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

[Chorus]
When your heart turns cold
It's like sparking a cigarette
It burn slow
Now you’re heartless, so
It's like taking shots to the head
It burn slow
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Feel That fire burn slow
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Feel That fire burn slow

[Verse 3]
Play with the flame in it
Might forget your name in here
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Get used to the numb, to the numb
Ain't what you want no more
I'll probably make it look too easy

[Chorus]
When your heart turns cold
It's like sparking a cigarette
It burn slow
Now you’re heartless, so
It's like taking shots to the head
It burn slow
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Feel That fire burn slow
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

[Outro]
Feel That fire burn slow
