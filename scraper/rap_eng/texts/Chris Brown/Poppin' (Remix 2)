[Intro: Meek Milll & French Montana]
(808 Mafia)
You got a motherfuckin' check in your pocket
Pull it out right now (skrrt) and contribute (Haaa)
Uh, yeah

[Pre-Chorusk: Meek Mill & French Montana]
(Hey) I'm standin' at a table full of trappers (Haaa)
(Hey) I pop a Perc and take off like it's NASA (Haaa)
(Hey-ey-ey) My niggas, they don't rap, but look like rappers (Haaa, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
(Hey) 'Cause when we get that work, we flip it backwards, Lord (Haaa)

[Chorus: French Montana]
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin', nigga
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin'
If you don't got no paper, you ain't poppin', nigga

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Ha, I met a bitch from uptown, I'm like, "Woah"
Patr√≥n shots, a couple of rounds, she like, "Woah"
My niggas ain't fuckin' around, they gon' go (bop!)
Think I'ma spend a cheque on that pussy, I'm like, "No" (ow!)
I put your bitch in a Phantom, that shit big as a planet
Got some bitches in Paris that speakin' French like Montana
Got a bitch in the projects, she be holdin' her hammer
Landed in California, 'bout to go to Atlanta
To meet my bitch from Miami, she want beef on the table
I moonwalk in that pussy, she thinkin' she Billie Jean
I got a TEC sittin' on the step and that's on the set
Here I go, wring a nigga neck, all about a check, yeah, I know (bitch)

[Pre-Chorusk: Meek Mill & French Montana]
I'm standin' at a table full of trappers (Haaa)
(Hey) I pop a Perc and take off like it's NASA (Haaa)
(Hey-ey-ey) My niggas, they don't rap, but look like rappers (Haaa, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
(Hey) 'Cause when we get that work, we flip it backwards, Lord (Haaa)

[Chorus: French Montana]
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin', nigga
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin'
If you don't got no paper, you ain't poppin', nigga (skrrt)

[Verse 2: French Montana]
You ran up on my set and tried to knock us (Haaa)
They heard I'm with the killers and the robbers (Haaa)
If I don't fire hammers and the choppers (Haaa)
I be ridin' 'til they free the Wavie Crockett (Haaa)
Khaki sippin' dirty at the house (Haaa)
My niggas, you don't rap 'cause you can't stop us (Haaa)
Blood, he papi, me and J. Lo in the projects (Haaa)
Nigga, you couldn't see us with binoculars (Haaa)
Hook game like Hopkins
Brick squad like Flocka
Let the birds fly like the Falcons
Ball like Francis with the Rockets
This that vintage Chanel, drinkin', twistin' cigars
Mixin' Cris' in the dark, cryin', grippin' the odds
Hit my man up, I had to go
Bulletproof sprinter, I be ridin' like the Pope, Montana

[Pre-Chorusk: Meek Mill & French Montana]
I'm standin' at a table full of trappers (Haaa)
(Hey) I pop a Perc and take off like it's NASA (Haaa)
(Hey-ey-ey) My niggas, they don't rap, but look like rappers (Haaa, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
(Hey) 'Cause when we get that work, we flip it backwards, Lord (Haaa)

[Chorus: French Montana]
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin', nigga
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin'
If you don't got no paper, you ain't poppin', nigga
