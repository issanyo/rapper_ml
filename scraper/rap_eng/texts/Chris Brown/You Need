[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Good morning, I've been watching you a few hours while you sleep
Thinking 'bout kissing your body in a place
Crazy look on your face
Bring breakfast on a plate, pour juice or lemonade, I'm your maid

[Pre-Chorus: Rob Allen]
I'ma show you what I'm made of
I'ma show you all I can do, oh
I'm a syllable woman, nothing is impossible
For me, yeah, and you know that I'll be here

[Chorus: Rob Allen]
I'm whatever you need (whatever you need, whatever you need)
I'll do anything for you, I'll do everything I ever could
That's why I want you (anything, everything)
Prove and show you everything I wanna do just for you
I'm whatever you need (whatever you need, whatever you need)
All you ever want, babe
I'll be more than your fantasy, I'll fulfill your wild dreams (fantasy, wildest dreams, yeah)
All that you want me, for you I'll make it big

[Vesre 2: Rob Allen]
Anytime is the right time for you
All you gotta do is say the word and I'll be running
If something's on your mind
Baby, it's nothing

[Pre-Chorus: Rob Allen]
I'ma show you what I'm made of
I'ma show you all I can do, oh
I'm a syllable woman, nothing is impossible
For me, yeah, and you know that I'll be here

[Chorus: Rob Allen]
I'm whatever you need (whatever you need, whatever you need)
I'll do anything for you, I'll do everything I ever could
That's why I want you (anything, everything)
Prove and show you everything I wanna do just for you
I'm whatever you need (whatever you need, whatever you need)
All you ever want, babe
I'll be more than your fantasy, I'll fulfill your wild dreams (fantasy, wildest dreams, yeah)
All that you want me, for you I'll make it big

[Bridge: Rob Allen]
If they had to lock me up and throw away to keep me
I'll still, still find my way to you and
If I, if I couldn't see, I'd still have a vision of what we could be
Yeah, you and me, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus: Rob Allen]
I'm whatever you need (whatever you need, whatever you need)
I'll do anything for you, I'll do everything I ever could
That's why I want you (anything, everything)
Prove and show you everything I wanna do just for you
I'm whatever you need (whatever you need, whatever you need)
All you ever want, babe
I'll be more than your fantasy, I'll fulfill your wild dreams (fantasy, wildest dreams, yeah)
All that you want me, for you I'll make it big
