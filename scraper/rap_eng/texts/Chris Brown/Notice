[Intro]
If you’re looking to fight
Then love, its what you can forget about
Baby, if you’re mine
Then stay, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
We don't need to speak if it's spoken
We don't gotta fix what's been broken
I'm so sick of going through the motions
Lately you've been fucking up my focus
And I just think I need some more patience, they say it's a virtue
And I know if I keep up this playing, bitches gon' hurt you
And I don't wanna be here alone, aw yeah
When you know it

[Chorus]
But I need you, I need you to notice
I need you, I need you to notice
I need you to know this, I need you, wow
Said I need you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I've been here before, yeah
Yeah, I've had two for one, yeah (one yeah)
Yeah, you know, you havin' fun yet?
You know my plans for you, I took a chance from you
I've been counting my blessings
Working on my profession
I been out here finessin', yeah
You've been off since you left here (ha)
I can't get back time

[Chorus]
But I need you, I need you to notice
I need you, I need you to notice
I need you to know this, I need you
Said I need you

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
I’ve been countin’ my blessings
Girl, when we fuckin’, you play with my mind
Usin' sex as a weapon
Knowin' I'll hit it, she win every time
Paid a brick for my necklace
Man of my word, I just work through my vision
Early, eatin' the pussy like it's breakfast
Stickin' my dick, while she washin' them dishes
Bust it open for the ‘gram, bust it for the ‘gram

[Chorus]
But I need you, I need you to notice
I need you, I need you to notice
I need you to know this, I need you
Said I need you
