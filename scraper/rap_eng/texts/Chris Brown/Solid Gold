[Verse 1]
Tryna keep my sanity, losing my mind
Don't know what you’ve done to me and I don’t know why
All eyes are on us, look around
Your eyes are the reason, you stand out in the crowd

[Pre-Chorus]
So I’ma buy a dime and you can get a stone
What it's going to be? You’re gon’ be my wifey, yeah
Woah, yeah, yeah
What I call a house, you can call a home
Burn it down, don’t throw me out
‘Cause all I want is you, woah

[Chorus]
Girl, you’re made of gold (made of gold)
Girl, your smile lights up the sky
You’re beautiful, oh, oh, you’re beautiful
It's impossible (impossible)
Girl, you’re burning hot like fire
Made of gold, made of gold
Burning hot

[Bridge]
I think you wanna love me
I think you wanna love me, baby
I think you wanna love me
I think you wanna love me baby
I think you wanna love me
I think you wanna love me baby
Girl, you’re made of gold
Solid gold, baby

[Verse 2]
I'm getting ready, getting ready to break you off
Your body, baby, it's so amazing, you don’t see that you’re a star
Oh girl, your lovin’
I'm about to wear you out
Come closer, baby, wanna hold you, baby
Do you hear me, girl?

[Pre-Chorus]
So I’ma buy a dime and you can get a stone
What it's going to be? You’re gon’ be my wifey, yeah
Woah, yeah, yeah
What I call a house, you can call a home
Burn it down, don’t throw me out
‘Cause all I want is you, woah

[Chorus]
Girl, you’re made of gold (made of gold)
Girl, your smile lights up the sky
You’re beautiful, oh, oh, you’re beautiful
It's impossible (impossible)
Girl, you’re burning hot like fire
Made of gold, made of gold
Burning hot

[Bridge]
Think you wanna love me, baby
Think you wanna love me, baby
I think you wanna love me
Think you wanna love me baby
I think you wanna love me
Think you wanna love me baby
Girl you’re made of gold
Solid gold baby
