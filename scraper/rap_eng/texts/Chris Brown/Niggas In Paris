[Intro: T-Pain & Chris Brown]
Look
It's your turn Chris
I don't do this for my day job, man
Let's go, baby
I do this shit for fun
I said let's go

[Verse: Chris Brown]
Look, I just came to get rid of every nigga
To murder every rapper, watch a nigga come up outta me
I'm stuntin' hard on these motherfuckers
Flyin' on the VMAs, Evel Knievel, the nigga proud of me
I'm drinkin' this shit 'til 5 in the mornin'
Your girl's number 1 pick, call me Mr. Lottery
I let a hater nigga die, pow, like it's suicide
I ain't givin' no more fuckin' apologies
Stunt so hard, that shit crazy, ain't shit free, fuck you pay me
Heron flow from the 80â€²s and my chain on me like, "We made it"
My kinfolk got 10 hoes, 5 whites, 2 blacks, like 3 Asians
My Benzo, God damn, hoe, nigga, take this shit I'm too faded
Go 'head and bring your crown over, ass kisser, brown noser
Fuck yo luck, I smoke clovers, I'm partyin' with boat owners
Marilyn Monroe hoes all on us, rookies tryna get your signin' bonus
Nigga, look at my chain, man, I paint ya face, you a clown, homie
Not tryna throw subliminal, my Porsche got force, centrifugal
Even if it's just 10 of y'all, I put you in the old school and you pin up dolls, yikes
That shit crazy, don't you play me
You tryna get on this bus, bitch, sign this waiver
Hol' up, hol' up, gimme that Chardonnay and that Marvin Gaye shit
But hol' up, my conversation too complicated, this bitch too basic
You ain't no groupie, girl and you know that I won't say shit
You got skeletons in your closet, I got aliens in my basement

[Outro: T-Pain]
Ladies and gentlemen
That's what you call rippin' the game a new asshole
CBE, Nappy Boy, baby, leggo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That shit cray
