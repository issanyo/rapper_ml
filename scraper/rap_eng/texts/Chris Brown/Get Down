[Intro: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
Hey, uh, hey, uh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
Rich nigga in the back seat of a Ghost, seat of a Ghost
Doing too much,  I'm doing the most, doing the most
Rims spinning, spinning cruise control, cruise control
The girls see me, see me, they lose control
I'm a, I'm a gang spitter, spitter, my mouth grip a milly, milly
You ain't heard about me I got clout round the city, city
650, 50 BMW
When I step up in the spot, they show me love

[Pre-Hook: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
If you know what I'm saying, say oh
If you know that I ain't playing, say oh
Just keep them hands waving, babe, oh
Then get get get get down, then get get get get down

[Hook: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
I hit the spot the girls get get get get down
Travelling around the world, get get get get down
Ooh, I know you like it, girl, get get get get down
Just drop it to the floor, they show me love
You know what you're doing, baby, keep that body moving baby
Won't you back it up on me?
You keep wondering if I'ma throw this money here
If you stay around long enough, you gon' see

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Rich nigga, you know I'm gon' get it
Money stacking up and I'm about to buy a city
Lady killer, doggy want the kitty
I'm about to break her up 'cause she nasty and she pretty
She got that pretty babe, that good good
I'm dig away, really good good
650 BMW
When I step up in this spot, they show me love

[Pre-Hook: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
If you know what I'm saying, say oh
If you know that I ain't playing, say oh
Just keep them hands waving, babe, oh
Then get get get get down, then get get get get down

[Hook: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
I hit the spot the girls get get get get down
Travelling around the world, get get get get down
Ooh, I know you like it, girl, get get get get down
Just drop it to the floor, they show me love
You know what you're doing, baby, keep that body moving baby
Won't you back it up on me?
You keep wondering if I'ma throw this money here
If you stay around long enough, you gon' see

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
I'm walkin' in the buildin', feelin' like I own the buildin'
When we pull up to the front, it's like an automotor dealer
Shippin' somethin' up the nature, blowin' chronic at the table
Please stop blowin' my buzz, I'm tryna bond with mother nature
All you haters so played out, y'all so 1999
And I'm so, “These ain't even out yet, no you can’t find these online"
And all my bitches fashion forward, your bitch is stuck on rewind
I got that lazy boy salary, my pockets stay on recline
Everybody get down, I'm throwin' 6 thou', man, I'm sayin'
I'm rollin' 6 pounds and blow that shit down, man, I'm sayin'
If looks could kill, she’d have a pistol in her purse
One to the dome, point blank range, pow pow, she's no amateur, I get down

[Hook: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
I hit the spot the girls get get get get down
Travelling around the world, get get get get down
Ooh, I know you like it, girl, get get get get down
Just drop it to the floor, they show me love
You know what you're doing, baby, keep that body moving baby
Won't you back it up on me?
You keep wondering if I'ma throw this money here
If you stay around long enough, you gon' see

[Outro: T-Pain]
Get get get get down
Get get get get down
Get get get get down
They show me love
You know what you're doing, baby, keep that body moving baby
Won't you back it up on me?
You keep wondering if I'ma throw this money here
If you stay around long enough, you gon' see
