[Verse]
Lady in a glass dress, I can see right through you
You act like you don't want this, but you know that you do
Since he broke your heart, girl, you say that you won't love again
And you won't let it stop girl, but we know in the end
You still dream, dream
You still dream, dream
Baby, I can make your dreams come true
Oh, oh, my lady in the glass dress, oh, oh
