[Verse 1]
Think I met a bad girl out in LA
I fell in love with her on the first date
She got queen written all over her face
When she gotta go, I just tell her to stay, got a nigga sprung
The way you move your body, girl you make me wanna love ya
She the only one after I hit it, I just wanna cuddle
She call me daddy, she ain't never had a father but I'm cool with her mother
She gon' have a baby when we fucking, we don't never use a rubber

[Chorus]
We gon' take our time and do it right, do it right
Take off your panties, leave 'em right here
Girl you know that pussy belongs to me, you know that body is gold to me
Make it last so start it off slow and I'mma speed it up

[Verse 2]
Sauvignon Blanc, we gon' drink the whole bottle
I'mma pop a molly cause you know it make me tear it up for hours
Pussy so wet, squirting on a nigga she done gave me a shower
Then I put it all in, all in and she get a little louder, oh
Smacking on the booty she done came 'bout three times
She gotta go to work in the morning, so tonight is our free time
And when she get her ass off of work, I'mma take her on a G-5
All around the world, that's my girl we the best when we high

[Chorus]
We gon' take our time and do it right, do it right
Take off your panties, leave 'em right here
Girl you know that pussy belongs to me, you know that body is gold to me
Make it last so start it off slow and I'mma speed it up

[Verse 3]
Wanna spend the rest of my life with her
She my ride or die, hold it down for me, that's my nigga
You can get it all from me, I got a wedding ring for you baby
All I need is for you to say one word and that's "Yes"
We go anywhere you wanna go
Making love in Italy all way to Monaco
Looking at the water when we pull up to the coast
And a candlelight dinner, celebrate and make a toast
Then it's to the bed, you just tell me when to go
Doing all that freaky shit that's for grown folks
Kissing on that pussy, know you need a little more
All my heart and all my love

[Chorus]
We gon' take our time and do it right, do it right
Take off your panties, leave 'em right here
Girl you know that pussy belongs to me, you know that body is gold to me
Make it last so start it off slow and I'mma speed it up
