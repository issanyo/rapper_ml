[Verse 1]
See I came in a two-seater
And I ain't tryna leave here alone by myself, hey
It feels so good to meet her, put her number and her picture in my phone
And got rid of everybody else, oh, listen to me, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know you the one, you the one
The stars, the moon, the sun, that's who you are
Put one hand in the air and put the other one in your hair (Oh, ooh)
And baby, show me how you get down low to the floor on this song
It's only one mission I'm on

[Chorus]
I won't leave this club alone
If you don't wanna leave right now with me, just let me know 'Cause everybody sweating you, sitting right next to you
And I ain't said nothing (And I ain't said nothing)
We can stay as long as you want to
But there's only one thing to do
Oh, baby, just drop (Baby), drop (Baby)
Drop it to the floor (Baby), floor (Baby), floor

[Verse 2]
Every time that I see her
She with her girls all comfortable, fine as hell
I tried to play it cool but I keep on thinking 'bout
What if we, what if we danced, no one else is leaving with her tonight
Let's get out this club 'cause I wanna do your body right
Make love on the floor, oh, your body
And girl, you saying you don't wanna but your body's telling me you want to
Come on, baby, and there's a whole lot of women in this party but I only want you

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know you the one, you the one
The stars, the moon, the sun, that's who you are
Put one hand in the air and put the other one in your hair (Oh, ooh)
And baby, show me how you get down low to the floor on this song
It's only one mission I'm on

[Chorus]
I won't leave this club alone
If you don't wanna leave right now with me, just let me know 'Cause everybody sweating you, sitting right next to you
And I ain't said nothing (And I ain't said nothing)
We can stay as long as you want to
But there's only one thing to do
Oh, baby, just drop (Baby), drop (Baby)
Drop it to the floor (Baby), floor (Baby), floor

[Bridge]
Look at the time, it's a quarter past 3
I know you don't wanna leave right now
Girl, it's what you want (Girl, you're a breath taker), breath taker
(Ooh, girl) Girl, I can't even breathe right now, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know you the one, you the one (Yeah)
The stars, the moon, the sun, that's who you are
Put one hand in the air and put the other one in your hair (Oh, ooh)
And baby, show me (Show me, yeah) how you get down low to the floor on this song
It's only one mission I'm on

[Chorus]
I won't leave this club alone
If you don't wanna leave right now with me, just let me know (Oh) 'Cause everybody sweating you, sitting right next to you
And I ain't said nothing (Yeah, yeah, oh, and I ain't said nothing)
We can stay as long as you want to (Want to, want to)
But there's only one thing to do (Ooh)
Oh, baby, just drop (Baby), drop (Baby)
Drop it to the floor (Baby), floor (Baby), floor

[Outro]
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, right
Ooh-do-la-la-la
Ooh-do-la-la-la
Ooh-do-la-la-la
Oh, woah
Just let me know and I ain't said nothing
