[Intro]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby, I know you gon' blame me for every problem (na na no, yeah)
When everybody got some skeletons in their closet (oh yeah, huh)
You’re always saying I don't love you right? (I know you would, huh)
And now you looking for somebody that's gon' do you better
I know you fuck with bitches, hope they get you wetter
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I hope you naked with some bitches in Jamaica
Me not gon' deal with fuck freaky, get da paper
I know you better, when we all alone
Fuck a text message or a letter, bitch, we grown
Bein' sneaky and fuckin' with a lame nigga
Live your life, bet you won’t be the same, nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
They say haters be in they feelings
I've been a sucker for the love, gotta let it go
'Cause I see that you love different
My homies always tryna tell me nigga, let her go

[Chorus]
But I love, I love, I love her, I can't let her go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I love, I love her, I can't let her go (oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I’ma do what I got to do, baby
But I love, I love, I love her, I can't let her go

[Verse 2]
When I lick the pussy, don't hear talking
I'm not gonna, I'm gon' haffi find a way out
Me want that box right now, get me vexed, turn the lights down
Don't let these girls fuck your head up
I wanna lick it so you tell your bitches I did my thing
Even though you said you wouldn't say nothing
Tryna get your bitches away from me
'Fore I pull it out and slice something

[Pre-Chorus]
They say haters be in they feelings
I've been a sucker for the love, gotta let it go
'Cause I see that you love different
My homies always tryna tell me nigga, let her go

[Chorus]
But I love, I love, I love her, I can't let her go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I love, I love her, I can't let her go (oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

But I love, I love, I love her, I can't let her go
