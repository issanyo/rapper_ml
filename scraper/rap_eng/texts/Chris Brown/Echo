[Verse 1: Jazz Lazer]
The only thing left is the money, that's a blessin'
I see you every now and then, I guess you are connected
My jeweller called the other day and said you bought a necklace
The same damn necklace that I bought you unexpected
And I had to accept it, but you tried to neglect it
I guess that's just you do when you're young and reckless
At the lobby at the SLS, I check out when you check in
I guess these red bottoms leave prints when you steppin'
When I think about it you talk shit, but that's just yo confession
That's real shit and I admit, even teachers learn lessons
Now I can consider what you want, how you feel
Every time we let go, you could hear the echo, still you know

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain't tryna let go ah, 'cause you're so beautiful
I shouldn't a have been restless yeah, I just want ya yes's back
I ain't tryna lose you no, I ain't tryna confuse you no
'Cause I done seen the best goal, where the only thing left is the echo
Saying na na na na na na, ay, na na na na na na, ay
'Cause I done seen the best goal, when the only thing left is the echo

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, white sounds, my own spaces, I called you up, just the other day
Just to say what up, but you ain't hit me back, oh we actin' brand new, what type of shit is that?
Used to be smiley faces, how we just erase it?
Left our hearts on the table, how you just replace it?
I know this game full of devils, I thought you my angel
Used to be so close to perfect, only thing missin', yo halo
Said we take time, now the time's gone
Scrollin' old texts, lookin' through my phone
Ain't spoke to you in ages, said I'd leave you alone
Tryna get that feelin' back, I just want my baby home

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain't tryna let go ah, 'cause you're so beautiful
I shouldn't a have been restless yeah, I just want ya yes's back
I ain't tryna lose you no, I ain't tryna confuse you no
'Cause I done seen the best goal, where the only thing left is the echo
Saying na na na na na na, ay, na na na na na na, ay
'Cause I done seen the best goal, when the only thing left is the echo

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
And baby, you know I want it and baby, you know you got it
Looking so right, body so nice and I can't press but I'm thinking about you
And baby, you know you want it and baby, you know I got it
I'll give up everything in the world, only wanna be with you, girl and I don't wanna let go, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain't tryna let go ah, 'cause you're so beautiful
I shouldn't a have been restless yeah, I just want ya yes's back
I ain't tryna lose you no, I ain't tryna confuse you no
'Cause I done seen the best goal, where the only thing left is the echo
Saying na na na na na na, ay, na na na na na na, ay
'Cause I done seen the best goal, when the only thing left is the echo
