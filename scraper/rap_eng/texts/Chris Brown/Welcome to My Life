[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Every dream in my head
It's like a mountain that I just keep climbing
And when I get to the edge
I turn around and put that dream behind me
And it never feels the way I want
But I keep on trying
I just keep on trying

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Have you been there?
Have you seen it all?
Have you done this once before?
Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?
Now you're lying on the floor
And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more
And this is your life
Your life, your life

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
(Ow!)
Welcome to my—

[Verse 1: Cal Scruby]
Hello, this my life in your TV
I overdose on that nightlife, them bright lights and bikinis
I keep my hand on that gold bottle, I'm tryna find me that genie
They say money doesn't buy happiness, but I'd rather cry in that
Lamborghini
Damn, I don't know who I am
I just know who I wanna be
No lookin' back, everything is in front of me
I never act like they puttin' a gun to me
I ain't stuck up, same motherfucker that I've always been
You must got me fucked up, think I changed when I got that all white Benz?
Never that though
Been on my job, sayin' I'm different now
Say I don't listen now
I don't got time to pick up the phone to hear what you bitchin' 'bout
I'm on a mission, feel like I'm missin' now
Bitch, you ain't in my position now
You never walked a mile in my shoes
I'm feeling so distant now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Have you been there?
Have you seen it all?
Have you done this once before?
Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?
Now you're lying on the floor
And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more
And this is your life
Your life, your life

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Welcome to my life—

[Verse 2: Cal Scruby]
I've been thinkin' too much (Much), I wonder if I did that right (Right)
I've been drinkin' too much (Much), I don't know what I did last night (Night)
Tried talk to myself like, "You don't really wanna live that life" (Life)
I wanted it all to myself like, you don't wanna give that life, away (Away)
But I gotta leave, I can't stay
Part of me say "Keep going," that other half say, "Quit playin'" (Playin')
Gotta keep prayin' (Prayin')
Even when I got it all, all these broads and alcohol
Livin' on the edge, I'm bound to fall (Fall)
But I stay movin', stay climbin' (Climbin')
Puttin' in work, I stay grindin' (Grindin')
Lookin' for the answer, can't find it (Find it)
That's the truth, I can't hide it (Hide it)
Now or never forever, that's how I'm livin' my life
It's hard to plan for tomorrow, when you just live for the night (Night)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Every dream in my head
It's like a mountain that I just keep climbing
And when I get to the edge
I turn around and put that dream behind me
And it never feels the way I want
But I keep on trying
I just keep on trying

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Have you been there?
Have you seen it all?
Have you done this once before?
Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?
Now you're lying on the floor
And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more
And this is your life
Your life, your life
