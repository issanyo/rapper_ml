[Intro]
Oh, we got this beat?

[Hook]
I'm just sitting in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
Song so f'ing dope, girl, it's hard not for me to blaze it, let's go
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I could play with
Huh, let me see what I got

[Verse]
Okay, I be bangin' all on that beat, 808, she got the bass when her booty shake
She got her friends with her and they a sight to see, all that butt, don't let it go to waste
All this Hennessy, the liquor, 'bout to penetrate, while I'm pushin' Lamborghini's on the interstate
I long-stroke her, I'ma go for hours, you minute-made like lemonade
I'm fresh as hell in these Margielas, as I skate pass, better than veterans
Bipolar cold, give me the medicine, my chain too bright, no Thomas Edison
When I pull it out, chick nervous, better ride this wave chick, surf it
Girl, you better keep them legs open, only thing you close is these curtains
Ha, and she only got time for a brother if I take her out to eat, a brother really gotta motivate
Man, that's too much work for the kitty, I don't work for the kitty, really don't communicate
Ha, I'd rather lick it like a dinner plate, I'd rather keep my money in a safe
Man, I ain't got time to play, I need it now, not a minute late
Now she blowin' up my line on the cellular, she wanna lock a brother down, on the regular
Talkin' crazy to me like she own it, but I don't trust her as far as I can throw her
Huh, momma told me to find a keeper, but I switch like designer sneakers, a girl with the finest features
Every brother wanna talk to her, but I got her first, finders keepers
Violins in the back, is my theme music, her booty on my mind, I dream booty
Any __ wanna ___ my ___, then it's off with his head, how kings do it
My ring's ruby, red bandana, I stay woopin', got too many cribs, I stay movin'
Three Lambos, I stay coupin', yeah, but you don't hear me though
Virginia to the Westside, my car foreign, the girl sit on the left side
I smokin' weed on the plane, that's the best high, gotta sign the waiver 'fore I let her fly
Huh, it's helipads on the boat, chillin' in the South of France, Saint-Tropez, Nice, Monaco
But nothin' compare to what's in my pants, girl, stop playin'
