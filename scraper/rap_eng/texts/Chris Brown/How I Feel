[Intro]
Yeah, it's how I feel, right
It's only me right, ha, it's life, ha

[Verse]
I was 15, a Virginia nigga with ambition
Young but I envisioned fuckin' them bad bitches
Live my life with no regrets, I try to show respect but you don't give it
I guess you don't understand winnin'
It might take me a lifetime to take it back
And it might take you a lifetime to know the facts
Yeah, just 'cause we different, don't mean we distant
And if you kill a man, ain't no way to bring him back
Yeah, they say it's mind over matter
But what we livin' for, what really matters?
Some niggas silver spoon just on a platter
And other niggas is doomed just for disaster
All alone sleepin' in my bedroom
As I wet the sheets, momma gon' be dead soon
'Cause a man beat her, but he don't realise
She important to this family like a fuckin' heirloom
Yeah, a nigga still found his way out
A record deal came, that nigga played out
My momma livin' good, she takin' days out
They sayin', "Boy, all that hard work paid off"
500 racks for an hour show
But ain't gon' ever do no 60 minute interview
'Cause all you wanna do is twist my words up
And all I wanna do is flip my birds up
Kinda tipsy off that red rum, murder
I'm a singin' ass nigga, know you heard of me
Every day my clique stuntin'
Niggas talkin' down
But I'ma make them pick they words up
I done said all I had to say, what else?
Cock suckers low blowin' under my belt
Yeah, they hangin' from the tip
They tryna get a sip, don't let them get a grip, I'm pissin' on them myself
19 a nigga went through a tragedy
3 years a nigga just found a better me
Yeah, you might find another lover
But you always started with Breezy like the letter "B"
Nightmares feelin' haunted
Thinkin' do I really like this star shit?
Huh, because fame ain't freedom
And this diamond chain only mean they hold you hostage
Now I got a lot of offers
Tellin' me to wear their clothes and they wanna be my sponsor
But when a nigga fall off again, they be like "off him"
And then they gonna smile up in your face just like "awesome", "great"
Wait, police and a thug cannot relate
I guess that's why this war on drugs is the debate
So I'ma keep on livin' my life from day to day
Learn from my mistakes
