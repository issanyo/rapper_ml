[Verse 1]
It feels like I'm ready to dance, aw baby
So we can move right to the rhythm of love
Ooh that dress is so fancy, yeah
And girl I hope you don't mind taking it off, take it off now girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't rush tonight, got a place in mind reserved for two
Show you right, girl, no need to run from me
Ooh, this very night could change your life I promise you
Don't be afraid of the dark, baby, just look at the disco ball

[Chorus]
We don't need no lights, ooh girl join me
We can get it 'til 4, 5, 6 in the morning
You gon' feel alright, you dancing, extra horny
You dancing like you drunk, like you drunk

[Verse 2]
Put your hands to the ceiling, hands to the ceiling
I want you to feel it all night long, I'mma rock your body back and forth
I'm committed, to make you my business, ay
And I'll be rocking all night long, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't rush tonight, got a place in mind reserved for two
Show you right, girl, no need to run from me
Ooh, this very night could change your life I promise you
Don't be afraid of the dark, baby, just look at the disco ball

[Chorus]
We don't need no lights, ooh girl join me
We can get it 'til 4, 5, 6 in the morning
You gon' feel alright, you dancing, extra horny
You dancing like you drunk, like you drunk

[Bridge]
Ooh girl you know I need you close, it ain't no one else in this room, but me and you
And baby if you ready, I'll take you if you let me
And we gon' have a hell of a night and you gon' have the time of your life
Yeah baby, girl, hey, oh baby, c'mon, let's get crazy, haha, let's get faded, here we are, 123

[Chorus]
We don't need no lights, ooh girl join me
We can get it 'til 4, 5, 6 in the morning
You gon' feel alright, you dancing, extra horny
You dancing like you drunk, like you drunk
We don't need no lights, ooh girl join me
We can get it 'til 4, 5, 6 in the morning
You gon' feel alright, you dancing, extra horny
You dancing like you drunk, like you drunk

[Outro]
Alright
Feel good don't it
Feel good don't it
