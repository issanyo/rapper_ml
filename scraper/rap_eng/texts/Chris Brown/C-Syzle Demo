[Intro]
Oh, oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Come on)
Ayy, oh, oh
Yo, wassup, ma?
Ooh, what happened to you last night?
Yeah, oh
Whatever, never mind then
Yeah, oh
But meet me tonight
Oh, you up for it?
Are you game? Ooh, ooh
You sure? Alright
Yeah, oh
Meet me later
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm the fire to your flame
Thought process to your brain
Make you wanna change your name
So I can be your man
And game on 'til you can
Start humming 'til you sing
Really remove your pain
'Cause I feel it too

[Pre-Chorus]
Is there something I can change?
I bet that I can hang
But there's something we must do
Let's meet tonight, you scared? Meet me

[Chorus]
Meet me tonight
Come inside, alright
Creeping out my window too
Just to meet you (Under the streetlights)
We can meet if you like
I'll be out 'bout 9
We can be me and you
At night, carefree (Under the streetlights)

[Verse 2]
You can see me from a distance
In white and leather fitted
For a sponser, [?]
So I grab my [?]
Burn fire from the floor
Let me burn the floor
Just in case you didn't know
I would have to tell you so

[Pre-Chorus]
Is there something I can change?
I bet that I can hang
But there's something you must do
If you'd like to kick

[Chorus]
Meet me tonight
Come inside, alright
Creeping out my window too
Just to meet you (Under the streetlights)
We can meet if you like
I'll be out 'bout 9
We can be me and you
At night, carefree (Under the streetlights)

[Bridge]
Sometimes you have to break the rules
And show a little attitude
How do you know what you will miss
If you don't try?
(Go)
(Come on, come on)
(Come on, come on)
(Come on, come on, come on)
(Come on, come on, come on)
(1, 1, 2, 3, come on)

[Chorus]
Meet me tonight
Come inside, alright
Creeping out my window too
Just to meet you (Under the streetlights)
We can meet if you like
I'll be out 'bout 9
We can be me and you
At night, carefree (Under the streetlights)

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
No, babe, yeah
Don't worry
I'll protect you
No, babe, yeah
I'm right here
I'm with you, yeah, yeah
Oh
