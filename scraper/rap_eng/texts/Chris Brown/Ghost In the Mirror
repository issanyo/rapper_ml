[Verse 1: Rob Allen]
She can't believe this happened to her right now
It's not the life to live for a young girl (she's so afraid and cold)
She wants to get out of their right now
It's like her whole world is getting torn down
She's lifeless and lost
Confused one day she says

[Chorus: Rob Allen & Chris Brown]
Who is this girl in the mirror? She's looking right back at me
Shes screaming but I can't hear her, who do I see?
And you know it's not really polite to stare
So who is this ghost in the mirror? 'Cause she's not me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Can't help the rain, but it's coming down and
Everything's great, don't know what to do
Not a smile in sight, all she does do is frown
Trapped in a storm, she got a ways to go
Baby girl is falling, dirty clothes she's left on the rain
She just wants to hide who she is deep inside
She walks to the glass and says

[Chorus: Rob Allen & Chris Brown]
Who is this girl in the mirror? She's looking right back at me
Shes screaming but I can't hear her, who do I see?
And you know it's not really polite to stare
So who is this ghost in the mirror? 'Cause she's not me

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
I'm tired of feeling like I wanna break down and cry
I don't even know my face, why am I losing it?
And I don't know my life
Don't see the same girl looking in my eyes
My reflection's playing tricks on me
I don't wanna play, I just wanna know

[Chorus: Rob Allen & Chris Brown]
Who is this girl in the mirror? She's looking right back at me
Shes screaming but I can't hear her, who do I see?
And you know it's not really polite to stare
So who is this ghost in the mirror? 'Cause she's not me
