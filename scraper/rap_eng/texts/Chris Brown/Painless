[Chorus]
You're the definition of perfection, quality, satisfaction
I guarantee I'm qualified
For your love, I'm ready, for your love
Wanna take this one heartbeat
For your heart, painless, painless
And all I need is TNT to start this spark
Blow it up, now you're in shock

[Verse 1]
Girl, you know you got that bomb shit, I want it
Girl, you know I got them explosives
Kissing and touching and freaking and loving your body all night long
That's the way I go, that's the way I go in, go in, in
This is the part when I steal your heart
And never give it back, back, back, back
This is my one chance to show you
That this is where it's at, at, at, at

[Chorus]
You're the definition of perfection, quality, satisfaction
I guarantee I'm qualified
For your love, I'm ready, for your love
Wanna take this one heartbeat
For your heart, painless, painless
And all I need is TNT to start this spark
Blow it up, now you're in shock

[Verse 2]
Girl, you know youâ€™re supernova, you're an angel
Brighter and brighter, you're a star, babe
Your halo is your crown
Let your love come down
Higher and higher, baby, don't fly away
Please stay under the clouds

[Chorus]
You're the definition of perfection, quality, satisfaction
I guarantee I'm qualified
For your love, I'm ready, for your love
Wanna take this one heartbeat
For your heart, painless, painless
And all I need is TNT, to start this spark
Blow it up, now you're in shock
