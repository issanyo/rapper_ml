(Girl talking in Swahili)

[Verse 1]
I should've been a better man
Instead of wasting time, spending my life searching for the finer things, woah
You always gave me another chance to make it right
But I didn't deserve 'cause I didn't understand

[Chorus]
And I feel so bad 'cause you wouldn't do the same to me
But I know what you weakness is
And you feel so mad and now you’re on an open road
So gone, not looking back

[Verse 2]
I thought I had you on a leash
Like I could do whatever I wanted to when I wanted to and you was gonna wait for me, baby, no
And now the tables have turned and now I feel like you’re the master
And I'm on the strings, you're in control of me

[Chorus]
And I feel so bad 'cause you wouldn't do the same to me
But I know what you weakness is
And you feel so mad and now you’re on an open road
So gone, not looking back
I'm looking for her, I'm tryna find her
I really need her, I think I love her
I'm looking for her, I'm tryna find her
I really need her, I think I love her

[Bridge]
You can blame it all on me
I know it’s like this because of me
Now I'm just like a hitch-hiker waiting for a ride
With no cars in sight

[Chorus]
And I feel so bad 'cause you wouldn't do the same to me
But I know what you weakness is
And you feel so mad and now you’re on an open road
So gone, not looking back
I'm looking for her, I'm tryna find her
I really need her, I think I love her
I wanna see ya, ooh, I don't ever wanna leave ya
I wanna keep ya, I think I love her
