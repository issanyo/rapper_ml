[Verse 1]
Who he with? Is it her? Is it her ?
Gon' go a head and talk about it
Where's he been? Where's he on?
Everybody got opinions but I won't allow it

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I'm so alone, I swear
That there's a couple things that I would erase
I can't even go nowhere
Without being reminded of my mistakes

[Chorus]
See I've been going way out on my way
I ain't doing it no more
That too much to deal with what you say
I ain't doing it no more
'Cause when they talking and they talking
About much shit that they don't know about
Yeah, in but there's no in and out
'Cause I've been going way out on my way
I ain't doing it no more

[Verse 2]
Now is he right? Is he wrong?
Get of mind of your own, instead of jocking my shit
'Cause either way I'ma win
I can do it all again, I ain't never gon' quit

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I'm so alone, I swear
That there's a couple things that I would erase
I can't even go nowhere
Without being reminded of my mistakes

[Chorus]
See I've been going way out on my way
I ain't doing it no more
That too much to deal with what you say
I ain't doing it no more
'Cause when they talking and they talking
About much shit that they don't know about
Yeah, in but there's no in and out
'Cause I've been going way out on my way
I ain't doing it no more

[Bridge]
Can't tell me nothing but she'll stay out my way
Been here for years and I'm still doing okay
So when you see me front-page, head lines, all up in the news
Don't you worry 'bout me 'cause I don't give a fuck about you

[Chorus]
See I've been going way out on my way
I ain't doing it no more
That too much to deal with what you say
I ain't doing it no more
'Cause when they talking and they talking
About much shit that they don't know about
Yeah, in but there's no in and out
'Cause I've been going way out on my way
I ain't doing it no more
I ain't doing it no more, now
It don't matter 'cause
I ain't doing it no more, now
It don't matter 'cause
I ain't doing it no more, now
It don't matter 'cause
I ain't doing it no more, now
