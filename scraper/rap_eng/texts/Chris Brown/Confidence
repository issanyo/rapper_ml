[Intro]
Yeah, oh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Tell me what you feeling
Wanna know what's on your mind
I know we ain't committed
But we do this all the time, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't tell nobody 'bout this affair
Baby, go and dirty whine it out, thank you, baby
We might not make it to the room, from right here
I love it when you tell me what to do, like sit right there
Yeah, I need that, Fifty Shades, ooh
Tie your hands properly, I'm loving it

[Chorus]
It's your confidence, oh woah
Your confidence, oh woah
Your confidence, oh woah
Confidence (confidence)
It's your confidence
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, ooh, ooh
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, ooh, ooh
Your confidence

[Verse 2]
Is this how we're living? I don't know, I can't have you all the time
And girl, I wish you made your decision
Girl, go ahead and make up your mind
Got me all out here feinin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't tell nobody 'bout this affair
Baby, go and dirty wine it out, thank you, baby
We might not make it to the room, from right here
I love it when you tell me what to do, like sit right there

[Chorus]
It's your confidence, oh woah
Your confidence, confidence, confidence
Your confidence, confidence, confidence
Confidence (confidence)
It's your confidence
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, ooh, ooh
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, ooh, ooh
Your confidence

[Outro]
Fifty Shades, ooh
Tie your hands properly, I'm loving it
Get on top me, inside you is where I wanna be
I love everything but most importantly, it's your confidence
