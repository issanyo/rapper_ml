Say what yo name is, ooh yeah that fits you girl
Tell me where you headed, can I walk with you girl?
You got that look in yo eyes, that look like you give yo boy a here good ol' time
And I'm on it girl, that's right I'm on it girl

[Pre-Chorus]

Cause we gon' do something, something is gon' get done
And we gon' get crunk and have a lot of fun and I say

Shawty, shawty, she wearing her hair
She working them jeans, she talking that talk just like I like it
