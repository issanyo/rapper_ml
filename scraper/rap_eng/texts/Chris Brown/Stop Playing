[Verse 1: Fre$h]
Out of the blue she keep sending me nudes, the phone blowing up (blowing up)
I'm coming through when I get out the stu', girl, you know what's up
Can't stop staring, know I'm tryna bone, no heron
Oh, your body calling me and it's apparent
I'ma mess around turn you into a parent

[Chrous: Fre$sh]
If you don't stop playing with a nigga, yeah
Girl, stop playing with a nigga
I know you thinking 'bout me while you laying with your nigga, yeah
I know I'm on your mind

[Verse 2: Fre$h]
I see you been having withdrawals, I'm the best prescription (yeah)
Got you reminiscing 'bout the sex position (woah)
Sail up in sheets, why you such a beast? (Ah)
Tell her practise makes perfect, baby, repetition (ah)
Like it when you face down
But tonight I want you on your back, yeah
We be having rich sex, see the Rollies match, yeah (bling)
These dollar signs in my zodiac (cash)
I know you heard I've been around like a cul-de-sac (ah)
But they just tryna kill the vibe, don't let it (don't let it)
Hating like, "I hope you don't get it" (truth be told)
They don't know I already got it
She be telling me it's mine, but I'm always being modest when I do it to you
Just hold your body close to mine, working like it's overtime
As long as they don't stop the music, I guarantee we both be fine
Forget whatever's on your mind, live like it's no rewind
Yeah baby, when you see, I can be everything you need

[Chrous: Fre$h & Chris Brown]
If you just stop playing with a nigga (woo)
Girl, stop playing with a nigga
I know you thinking 'bout me while you laying with your nigga, yeah
I know you thinking 'bout me
Baby girl, stop playing with a nigga
Girl, stop playin with a nigga
I'ma have you thinking 'bout me while you laying with your nigga
While you lay, while you lay, while you lay, oh ha

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Ain't got a lot to kick it, baby
Lambroghini keys to the city
If I'ma eat the ass, I'ma leave the titties
We gon' get freaky and uh, she gon' bring her friends
Eat that pussy, they gon' give it to me (oh)
All the niggas spending money for the sensation, yeah
They be bluffing, they be roughing from the temptation (yeah)
Fuck the haters and your peers, be on, lady
Let me lick up your ear, turn you on, baby
Girl, you like liquor andwine
Lick your private then look in your eyes
Baby, we got a lot time
On your back, on the floor, bottom line, foreplay
'Cause I'ma go get her
These numbers in my phone, I might just forget 'em
I know these hoes nosey, but don't tell your business
If you do, don't act like you innocent
'Cause you a bad bitch, yeah, and I'm a savage
Pussy wet, that's automatic
Bang bang like the trigger
I got all the figures that you need

[Chrous: Fre$h & Chris Brown]
If you just stop playing with a nigga (woo)
Girl, stop playing with a nigga
I know you thinking 'bout me while you laying with your nigga, yeah
I know you thinking 'bout me
Baby girl, stop playing with a nigga
Girl, stop playin with a nigga
I'ma have you thinking 'bout me while you laying with your nigga
While you lay, while you lay, while you lay, oh ha

[Outro: Fre$h]
I'm coming through when I get out the stu' you know what's up
