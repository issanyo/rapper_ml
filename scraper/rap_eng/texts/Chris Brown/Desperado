[Verse 1]
Shit is kinda crazy, how you work me, lady
Thought I wouldn't notice, I can see you changing
When did all this happen? All this extra foreplay?
How you gon' try to play me then go and try to kiss my face?

[Chorus]
I want you to know that it's over, get your shit right now
I guess the good guys always play the fool
I want you to know that I'll be fine if you're not my girl
Don't need you anymore, don't love you anymore cause you're a cold desperado

[Verse 2]
No won't last and you feeling like something's wrong, you got me, good one baby
Why'd you break my heart? Never thought you were this way before, but now I know
But I ain't gonna run away and little mama, you won't put me out cause I bought this house, so leave
If you so fly, be gone, if you the shit, here's some toilet paper, you did me a favour

[Chorus]
I want you to know that it's over, get your shit right now
I guess the good guys always play the fool
I want you to know that I'll be fine if you're not my girl
Don't need you anymore, don't love you anymore cause you're a cold desperado
