[Verse 1]
Her body was woo by the way that she walked in
Honey, looked just like a sin, I was memorized when she walked by
Now what I'm gon' do 'cause i gotta keep my cool
And I ain't that type of guy that steps to every girl that catches my eye

[Pre-Chorus]
Belly shirt, pierced navel and them heels
From your walk and your gestures what's the deal?
So baby, come over here, what's your name? Girl, tell me everything you like
Lil mama, don't have no fear, don't be scared 'cause you know I ain't gonna bite

[Chorus]
Baby, it's okay if you wanna pop
Lil mama, show me what you got
And I wanna say hey 'cause I'm feeling you
Baby, can you make your body move?
And I gotta say oh lady
Girl, I wanna get to know ya when I run up on ya
Yeah, oh, baby, you got me fired up
And girl, I wanna say hey

[Verse 2]
You can call me sometimes, we can get up, you and me
Let me tell you what I'm gonna do to make you mine
I'm gonna get it started, right on time, don't need no corny pick up lines
I'ma whisper in your ear and tell you everything that you wanna hear

[Pre-Chorus]
Outspoken, got me open, gimmie chills
Have a little conversation, I'm contemplating how she feels
So baby, come over here, what's your name? Girl, tell me everything you like
Lil mama, don't have no fear, don't be scared, baby girl, tell me what's the deal

[Chorus]
Baby, it's okay if you wanna pop
Lil mama, show me what you got
And I wanna say hey 'cause I'm feeling you
Baby, can you make your body move?
And I gotta say oh lady
Girl, I wanna get to know ya when I run up on ya
Yeah, oh, baby, you got me fired up
And girl, I wanna say hey

[Bridge]
I think I done and got caught up with a bad girl
Oh, you's a bad girl, oh, you's a bad girl
I think I done got shook up with a bad girl
Oh, you's a bad girl, oh, you's a bad girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Belly shirt, pierced navel and them heels
Have a little conversation, I'm contemplating how she feels
So baby, come over here, what's your name? Girl, tell me everything you like
Lil mama, don't have no fear, don't be scared, baby girl, tell me what's the deal

[Chorus]
Baby, it's okay if you wanna pop
Lil mama, show me what you got
And I wanna say hey 'cause I'm feeling you
Baby, can you make your body move?
And I gotta say oh lady
Girl, I wanna get to know ya when I run up on ya
Yeah, oh, baby, you got me fired up
And girl, I wanna say hey
