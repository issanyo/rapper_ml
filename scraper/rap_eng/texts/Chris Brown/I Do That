[Intro: SJR]
I do that, I do that, I do that
I do that, I do that, I do that
I do that, I do that, I do that

[Chorus: SJR]
Switch it up, I do that, I do that, I do that
Racks, I do that, I do that, I do that
Big loads, I do that, I do that, I do that
Truths, I do that, I do that, I do that
You don't do that, I do that, I do that, I do that
AE, I do that, I do that, I do that
Hollisters, I do that, I do that, I do that
Bands, I do that, I do that, I do that, you don't do that

[Verse 1: SJR]
Fresh up out the switch, hit the script, drive through that
With a bad bitch and you know I'm finna do that
When I get that hard ten racks, straight blew that
On my Louis, Gucci, like. "Where the fuck the shoe at?"
They see me when I'm comin' 'cause I shine when I do that
Boys talkin' down, ain't no maxin' when they do that
Haters everywhere, I be stuntin' everywhere
I be grindin' everywhere. gettin' money, yeah, I do that
Tryna get the sack, 6 what I tip
5 for the loud, 1 for the trip
I'm young makin' chips, bags of them 'tatos
You tryna get them blocks, Legos
Green light, leggo, like U-Haul, I move that
Houston, Atlanta, Vegas, all the chicks wanna screw that
We switchin' out, boy, thought you niggas knew that
All about my grind, I hold my own

[Chorus: SJR & (Chris Brown)]
Switch it up, I do that, I do that, I do that (money)
Racks, I do that, I do that, I do that  (stunting)
Big loads, I do that, I do that, I do that (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Look, when I'm overseas, private jets, I do that (do that)
While up watchin' pilot, bought a plane for my pilot (pilot)
Yeah, 'cause I do that (do that), ain't nothin' to it (to it)
Money lookin' dumb so you know my chain stupid
You always see me off, and my city showin' off
With some big ol' tig ol' biddies, if they pretty, pull 'em out
My expenses evidently, surpass all you talkin' 'bout
What the fuck you talkin' 'bout? We don't care how much it costs like
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm gettin' money I'ma say
Yeah, I'ma make it rain, throw it in the air
I'ma spend my dough, uh, everywhere
And we gon' party all night
One week a hundred racks (racks), I'll make that money back (back)
Yeah, hustle up, I ball, runnin' back (back)
I'm about my cash, girls love my pretty boy swag
When it comes, you be gettin' the best, yeah, I do that

[Chorus: SJR & (Chris Brown)]
Switch it up, I do that, I do that, I do that (money)
Racks, I do that, I do that, I do that  (stunting)

AE, I do that, I do that, I do that (stunting)
Hollisters, I do that, I do that, I do that (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bands, I do that, I do that, I do that, you don't do that

[Verse 3: SJR]
When I'm in the club, all the girls like, "Who that?"
Tryna be the man but I can't let these shorties do that
Call it swag swoo, I'm the first one to do that
I go racks on racks on racks, don't make me prove that
I do that, make it rain, hoe
Money ain't no thang, hoe, come and get this chain, choked
Love when it rains 'cause they never think the same, hoe
When I leave your name, hoe, then I let my things go
We be in the smoke cloud, I can hear the chief bird
Tryna get loud, we sell it by the speaker
I see a bad bitch, just know I'ma freak her
If she got low miles, shawty is a keeper
I grind for the check, get it with my people
Tryna get you one, you got it for the D-Low
We let them birds fly, American eagles
Hollister seagulls, me and my amigos

[Chorus: SJR & (Chris Brown)]
Switch it up, I do that, I do that, I do that (money)
Racks, I do that, I do that, I do that  (stunting)
Big loads, I do that, I do that, I do that (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Truths, I do that, I do that, I do that
You don't do that, I do that, I do that, I do that (money)
AE, I do that, I do that, I do that (stunting)
Hollisters, I do that, I do that, I do that (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bands, I do that, I do that, I do that, you don't do that
