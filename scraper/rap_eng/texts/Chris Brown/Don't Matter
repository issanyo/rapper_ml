You leavin with me
But I know you got a man though
And you know I got a girl so
Let´s get out of the club
Don't none of that matter tonight
You leavin' with me
Valet grab the benz so
Girl please let your friends know
But don't none of that matter tonight

I Know what the girls like
Hard pippin' and big bank will change your life
That's if I light
Got a man well he ain't a knight and something tells me your man ain't laying it right
So here we go, take a shot of this to make sure your mind open
Smoke this its hard to focus and keep your eyes open
Inflatuation a waste of my time and your emotion
Ya been with these suckers too long, time for a promotion
Witness strong attraction, my huge advantages
What she dont do in the van she'll do in the mansion
Just imagine me and you and a moment of passion
Overlooking the city on a circular mattress
Know that ass too nice just to be used for dancing
Tell me how could something so sweet be so nasty
And baby I dont mean no harm I'm just asking
Got ya hands in my pants with my belt unfastened so I guess that means...

You leaving with me
But I know you got a man though
And you know I got a girl so
Let´s get out of the club
Don't none of that matter tonight
You leaving with me
Valet grab the benz so
Girl please let your friends know
I know it's only me and you
But don't none of that matter tonight
