[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Keri Hilson]
Weak, I have been crying and crying for weeks
How'd I survive when I can barely speak, barely eat, on my knees?
But that's the moment you came to me, I don't know what your love has done to me
Think I'm invincible I see through the me, I used to be

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Keri Hilson]
You changed my whole life
Don't know what you're doing to me with your love
I'm feeling all superhuman, you did that to me
A superhuman heart beats in me
Nothing can stop me here with you
Superhuman, superhuman, superhuman

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Keri Hilson]
Strong, since I've been flying and righting the wrongs
Feels almost like I had it all along, I can see tomorrow
But every problem is gone because, I flew everywhere with love inside of me
It's unbelievable to see how love could set me free

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Keri Hilson]
You changed my whole life
Don't know what you're doing to me with your love
I'm feeling all superhuman, you did that to me
A superhuman heart beats in me
Nothing can stop me here with you
Superhuman, superhuman, superhuman

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Keri Hilson]
It's not a bird, not a plane, it's my heart and it's gonna go away
My only weakness is you, only reason is you
Every minute with you I feel like I can do anything
Going going I'm gone away in love

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Keri Hilson]
You changed my whole life
Don't know what you're doing to me with your love
I'm feeling all superhuman, you did that to me
A superhuman heart beats in me
Nothing can stop me here with you
Superhuman, superhuman, superhuman
