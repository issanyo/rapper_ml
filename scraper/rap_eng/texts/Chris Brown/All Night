[Verse 1]
Right now, we could be in this too deep
When you're caught up, caught up, oh
Same time you pull up, pull up
Make me forget everything, I promise, yeah
I'm just being honest

[Pre-Chorus]
How fast you know, know, know, know
You don't need anything from me
It's all about the chase
You must be used to them niggas always spending that money
Until you get your way
You can spend everything but it don't mean a thing
Ooh, if you're not here, touching you there
Ooh, ooh, baby

[Chorus]
Ain't no wrong time 'cause anytime, need you to make a way
On time like every time, anytime night or day
Late nights I don't reply, unless you on your way overr
You on your way over
To do it all night long
Girl, you're making me wait, all night long
All night long, girl I've been waiting, all night long
All night, all night

[Verse 2]
Tell you what, darling
Ain't no talking, baby, just get naked
Cut your phone off, and I'm on the way
Can't wait 'til we touching
Better not tell the baby girl how much you got it, huh
All night 'til the morning, ooh, woo

[Pre-Chorus]
How fast you know, know, know, know
You don't need anything from me (ooh)
It's all about the chase
You must be used to them niggas always spending that money (ooh)
Until you get your way (ooh)
You can spend everything but it don't mean a thing (no, no)
Ooh, if you're not here, touching you there
Ooh, ooh, baby

[Chorus]
Ain't no wrong time 'cause anytime, need you to make a way
On time like every time (oh, oh), any time night or day
Late nights I don't reply (hey), unless you on your way over
You on your way over (hey)
To do it all night long (long, woah, oh)
Girl, you're making me wait, all night long (you make me, oh)
All night long (na, na), girl, I've been waiting, all night long (oh, na, na, na)
All night, all night
