Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum (What's wrong with me?)
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum (Why do I feel like this?)
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum (I'm going crazy now)
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum

[Verse 1]
No more gas in the rig (can't even get it started)
Nothing heard, nothing said (can't even speak about it)
Out my life, out my head (don't want to think about it)
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind, it can control you
It's too close for comfort

[Pre-Chorus]
Put on your brake lights, we're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice, watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise (Your mind is in)

[Chorus]
Disturbia, It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, Am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia Disturbia

Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum

[Verse 2]
Faded pictures on the wall (it's like they talkin' to me)
Disconnected, no one calls (the phone don't even ring)
I gotta get out or figure this shit out
It's too close for comfort, ooh
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind, it can control you
I feel like a monster

[Pre-Chorus]
Put on your brake lights, we're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice, watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise (Your mind is in)

[Chorus]
Disturbia, It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, Am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia Disturbia

Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum

[Bridge]
Release me from this curse I'm in
Trying to maintain but I'm struggling
If I can't go, go, go
I think I'm going to oh, oh, oh...

[Pre-Chorus]
Put on your brake lights, we're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice, watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise (Your mind is in)

[Chorus]
Disturbia, It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, Am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia Disturbia

Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
