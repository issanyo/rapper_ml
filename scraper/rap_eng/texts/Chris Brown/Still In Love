If I, if I could hold you so close now
I could look into your eyes
You'll forget what I said to you
When you left, when you left
And if I, I could get to you right now
I'll tell you where was my mistake
You'll forget all the things I did
When you were here, you were here
And I ask the moon to hold the tide
Though I'll have to put my pride aside
Even if it takes a million years
Still I know that you will share my tears
Oh, I can't believe it's over now
That you're gone, that you're gone
I can't believe we're fadin' out
Girl in my heart there is no doubt
I can't believe we're over now
You're not gone, you're not gone
We're not alone, it's written in stone
I just know, I just know, I just know
We're still in love
If I, if I could hear your voice again
Like you were never gone
You'll tell me to carry on
Cause you're right here, you're right here
And if we, if we could only turn back the time
Forget about the fuss and fights
Let us rewrite the words tonight
Like we just met, we just met
There are always days without the sun
You'll never see the rain until it's gone
Now I'm sorry for the things I've said
There is only you inside my head
Oh, I can't believe it's over now
That you're gone, that you're gone
I can't believe we're fadin' out
Girl in my heart there is no doubt
I can't believe we're over now
You're not gone, you're not gone
We're not alone, it's written in stone
I just know, I just know, I just know
We're still in love
I don't know
If you are still in love
But I will fight to
Make you turn around
Make you change your mind
I can't believe it's over now
That you're gone, that you're gone
I can't believe we're fadin' out
But in my heart there is no doubt
I can't believe we're over now
You're not gone, you're not gone
We're not alone, it's written in stone
I just know, I just know, I just know
We're still in love
