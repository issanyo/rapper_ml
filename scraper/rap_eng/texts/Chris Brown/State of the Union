[Verse 1]
Dreaming all the time, thinking to myself
If I'm man enough, if I'm good enough for you
I keep thinking about when you said
I know I wasn't ready for it, guess I was too scared
Wasn't prepared for what life had to bring me
I just wanted to be free, or someone to need me
Every day I'm feeling like I can't breathe, no
I can't get no sleep, got the weight of the world on me
But it's alright, alright, alright
It ain't a surprise, surprise, surprise
Gotta do what you gotta do where I'm from
I'ma shoot if I gotta shoot, I don't like guns
But everybody hating, where the love at?
If I give it to you, will you give the love back?
Ooh, it's time for everybody to level up and settle up your problems
Just go ahead and let God in 'cause he got us, yeah

[Verse 2]
Tired of running from the police, huh
Never fucking over my homies, huh
Hope my niggas make it in one piece, huh
In my lane whipping in it one seat, huh
I know a lot of people owe me
But I won't go back to the old me
Please stop acting like you know me
On my place, tryna keep us going
You got the right, the right to live it up
Shine 'til your light is bright and big enough
And if you bow down, come on, pick it up
When you aim for the sky, you start lifting up
It's super heavy to carry your own weight
And too much to finish what's on your plate
But it's okay, it's okay, okay, okay
