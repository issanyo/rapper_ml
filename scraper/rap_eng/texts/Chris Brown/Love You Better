[Intro: Sample]
I made it like that
I bought it like that
I'm living like that

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (King Combs)]
Tell me how to make things right, ooh
'Cause I just need you in my life (uh)
Girl, I love you better than yourself (yeah, yeah)
Better than you love yourself (yeah)
I just need your loving, baby (yeah)

[Verse 1: King Combs & Chris Brown]
Who gon' love you like I do? That's word (oh)
And all the times you confused, my words, you don't listen (oh)
You could've had Christian and Christian Dior (yeah)
Now you just miss and I'm missin' you more (oh, woah)
But you knew that I'm the cool cat with the roof back (yeah)
Know I need you by my side, can't lose that (oh)
But you still wanna test the waters (yeah)
Like I never showed you jets and waters on the coast of Florida (yeah)
So why you wanna act like that? (Woo)
Like the nigga never had your back
His or hers to match
What's wrong, girl? Pick up the phone
Sayin', "You not home, nigga, leave me alone" (woo!)
But fuck it then, that's my word, I'll never love again
Same time wantin' you back, I'm a sucker then (ooh, baby)
Coulda gave you my last name, you on some other shit
All 'cause you thought I was laid up with some other chick

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh, baby, tell me, tell me
Tell me how to make things right (how to make things right)
'Cause I just need you in my life (I just need, I just need)
Girl, I love you better than yourself (I just need, I just need)
Better than you love yourself (better, ooh)
I just need your loving, baby

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Girl, I know you want me
Stop playing this game with me
Girl, it's about that time
For you and I to get this right
Now lay your head on my bed
Me pushing your face in the pillow
You remind me of my Jeep
So hop on it and just ride with me (ow!)

[Verse 3: King Combs, Chris Brown & Both]
Had me thinkin' everything was alright
Out of town I was bookin' your flights
Come and chill for a night
'Cause when we together we be wildin' (yeah)
Out of star island
On a yacht, playin' our favorite album (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (yeah)
And I know you still think about it (I know)
When the people doubted
I was the one that you stuck around with
Gettin' Fetty, baby, come my way
Love my songs, everyone I play, it's on my mind all day (yeah)
Late nights when I feel the pain
I messed up but I feel the same
Tell me who's to blame?
You just left like your Uber came
And you stressed, yeah, my mood just changed
I'm in the coupes and things
And you the only one that catch my eye
Matched my fly, chicks wave when I pass them by
But they don't catch my vibe like you do
My love is truthful without you girl, to be crucial (yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tell me, tell me how to make things right (tell me how)
'Cause I just need you in my life (oh, oh)
Girl, I love you better than yourself (oh, oh)
Better than you love yourself (oh, woah)
I just need your loving, baby

[Outro: Chris Brown]
You're the only one for me
You're the only one I need
Can't nobody make me feel the way you're making me feel, no, no
Better than you loved yourself
Better than you loved yourself
I just need your loving, baby
