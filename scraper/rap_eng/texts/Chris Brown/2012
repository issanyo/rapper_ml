[Intro]
Faire l'amour lendemain

[Verse 1]
What if the sky was turning red?
I know we'd be safe right here in my bed, laying face to face
Oh girl, I love the way you sound when you rain on me
So tonight let's act it out, show you how it's gon' be
I'm gon' kiss your other set of lips
Hold your body by your legs and hips
The world can't end until we finish
Girl, we gon'

[Chorus]
And we gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world
And they depending on us
To make Earth shaking love
As we lay down, lay down
Telling me to go harder, go harder
You're telling me to go deeper, go deeper
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker
We can go longer if you just lay down, lay down, down

[Verse 2]
All these vibrations from your legs, massaging my back
I got your body shivering 'cause we're covered in sweat
And girl, I like the way it opens up, when you throw it back, babe
Girl, it might be too much, oh babe, if you keep doing that
I got that pillow for your knees right here
Baby, can you make it disappear?
Your voice is the last thing I'm gonna hear
Then I wanna make you holler

[Chorus]
We gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world
And they depending on us
To make Earth shaking love
As we lay down, lay down
You're telling me to go harder, go harder
You're telling me to go deeper, go deeper
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker
We can go longer as we lay down, lay down, down

[Bridge]
Do it like we only got one, baby, let's pretend we only got one night
One last time, let me take my time and do it to you right
Buildings and bridges may be falling down, but that won't stop me from turning that thing around, girl, yeah
Won't you come on over and we can treat it like it's the motherfuckin' end of the world? Woo

[Chorus]
And they depending on us
To make Earth shaking love
As we lay down, lay down
Telling me to go harder, go harder (a nigga goin' hard in the paint, you think I can)
You're telling me to go deeper, go deeper (a nigga so deep, underwater, can you feel me submarine?)
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker (my hands, baby you gon' feel this [rain?] [?])
We can go longer if you just lay down, lay down, down

[Outro]
A nigga going hard in the paint, you think I can?
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint, you think I can?
Going for miles, no stops, a nigga going hard in the paint
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint, you think I can?
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint, you think I can?
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint
