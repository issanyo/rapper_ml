[Verse 1]
Ha, look, okay, now usually I don't do this, but your ass, got me turnt up
Poppin' all that pussy, booty bouncin', I got a ounce, roll up
Wanna see you get loose, take my credit card, that's my account
Lamborghini's on me, just so I can see the bitch ride around
Everythin' I go, all the Ace in the air, better hide these hoes
I do it like a show, about a hour forty-five and I'm out the door
I'm fly as hell with my clientèle, my pockets swole
Got guns for them niggas, roses for them bitches, make a nigga Rock 'n' Roll
I'ma hold my set up, elevate like nigga do better
But if one night, I gotta take life
You gon' see the residue from my Baretta
I got way too many bitches on me for me to be lonely
To worry about a bitch that might be fuckin' a homie
Low key, never that, I put up a .40
Back up motherfucker, don’t act like you know me
I be in that trap, when a nigga was 13, I did that
Saw them Jordan 13’s, sold a ounce, nigga, I'm gon' get that
Got that hunger for that pussy, I'm up in there, that cloud nine
Smoking'on my shit, now she feelin' like she in mile high

[Hook]
Feel that, won't you feel that?
Murder, murder, girl I'm gon' kill that
Throw it in the air, where you live at?
If I get it tonight, you bringin' that shit back

[Verse 2]
You never gon' get it like this, never gon', never gon' get it like this
I got a buzz, you fucked up, playin' that future, light years
In VIP put your purse right here, ass and your glass up, let's cheer
And this party never stop until I fuck every girl in here
Okay, I'm 23 tryna get billions, V.A nigga on a stage and a nigga paid
Nigga, better pay me millions, every time that I hit it and I blaze on a winter day
What you mean I'm hoggin'? I'm ballin' hard, you other niggas in the lane
Tryna violate, 3 seconds in the paint, 23 I'm MJ
Too much, I got, fuck nigga, that’s your problem
Open her mouth up, open her mouth up, give me the bottle
Oh shit, your bitch, she about to swallow
You smokin' weed while I'm pilled up, takin' two L's, Apollo
You gon' try to call her tomorrow, that number change, that’s my bitch
You cryin' about it, unfollow, direct message to my dick
'Cause you never gon' do it like this, never gon', never gon' do it like this
I was singin' as a kid but now I'm 23 with a Clip, DJ better play my shit

[Hook]
Feel that, won't you feel that?
Murder, murder, girl I'm gon' kill that
Throw it in the air, where you live at?
If I get it tonight, you bringin' that shit back

[Verse 3]
Okay now this is for my homies, them niggas that never really had shit
Now everythin' I'm ownin', ten million sold, that’s a bad bitch
Red chucks and that Cali life, my niggas ridin' for me
Ratatatata, all them hoes singin' jeep cherokee
And your bitch about to roll out, straight to the house
Fuck on the couch, touchin' my dick, girl, it's a pull up
Poppin' a molly, fuckin' with bitches that fool around
Smokin' that good, we start fuckin', I put it down
So baby, what’s the hold up?
I'ma turn you on but let's tell it like that
I know you feel that, feel that, feel that shit right now

[Hook]
Feel that, won't you feel that?
Murder, murder, girl I'm gon' kill that
Throw it in the air, where you live at?
If I get it tonight, you bringin' that shit back
