[Intro: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Aw yeah
Ain’t no party, like a rich nigga party
‘Cause a rich nigga party, don’t stop

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Don’t play with it (yeah)
All this money over here
Little mama, don’t play with it (that's right)
Ayy girl, ayy girl
She gon’ let a nigga lay in it
She know that pussy too good
Fuck around and make a nigga stay in it
I’ma stay in it

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Ha, posted on the wall with a dancer (what we doin’?)
Thousand dollar belt, pull my pants up (yeah)
Four finger ring, with the Phantom
Outside bag, full of money like it's ransom (haha)
Got a high tolerance and high standards
Top floor suites, with models and no manners (freaks)
Light skin nigga, bitches think I know Spanish
Love me, love me, love me, I got the answers, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
I’ma make this girl love me
She see the bottles, after bottles
I’m spending pesos, yeah, ain't nothin' we just do it, baby, do it, baby
No chaser, she gon’ drink it straight up
Baby, don’t run from me (yeah)
Facin' the pillow, fuckin’ up your make-up
Don't play with it (don’t play it)
She know that pussy too good, straight up

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Baby, I’m a baller, Balmain and Bugattis
Bitch, ain't a nigga got it, yeah, I’m all about deposits
Yeah, I’m master Myagi, off shine, like ball here
I'm Ricky with the Rolls Royce, really, I’m really
How dare you offend me? Your life a pity
I pity the fool, the fools that goin' for work penny (you a bitch nigga)
I love women, as much as lesbians
I lube in the mister, best feelin', forget ‘em
Then we visit that pussy, drippin’
She got good credit, make that pussy drippin’, drip, drippin’
Squirtin' all up on Cavalli sheets, she a beast, I’m a gremlin
After midnight, you know the rest right? Right

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
I’ma make this girl love me (love me, yeah)
She see the bottle, after bottles (spending pesos)
Spending pesos, ain't nutting’ we just do it baby (yeah)
No chaser, she gon' drink it straight up (straight up)
Baby, don’t run from me (yeah)
Facing the pillow, fuckin’ up your make-up
Don't play with it (don’t play with it)
She know that pussy too good, straight up

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Oh woah, I’m gon’ make you love me tonight
Oh woah, I’m gon’ make you love me tonight
Oh yeah, I’m the man and you know it
Hands all over your body, girl
And that ass, you really need to show it (real shit)
I bet, I can make your body rock
I bet, I can make you feel good
Fuck around and make your heart stop
When I give you this wood
Baby, your body’s calling
I can’t wait no more
Girl, you better stop with the bullshit
Leave them panties on the floor
I’m ‘bout to pull up on this
So let down your hair
So baby, don’t play with it (don’t play with it)
Don't play with it (don’t play with it)

[Pre-Chorus:Chris Brown & Tyga]
Don’t play with it (yeah)
All this money over here
Little mama, don’t play with it (she gon’ do with it)
Ayy girl, ayy girl
She gon’ let a nigga lay in It (I’ma lay in it)
She know that pussy too good
Fuck around, and make a nigga stay in it
I’ma stay in it, straight up

[Outro: Tyga]
Ain't no party, like a rich nigga party
‘Cause a rich nigga party, don’t stop
Huh, ain't no party, like a rich nigga party (bitch)
‘Cause a rich nigga party, don’t stop
T-Raw, CB, real shit
