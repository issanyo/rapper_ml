[Hook]
And I'm like Jordan wearin' 45
I told you I was comin' back
And every time they tried to push me out
I told you I was comin' back
45, 45, goin' back like I ain't leave
45, 45, I been nice since 23
Ballin' hard, ballin' hard, swear I need a referee
I can see the jealousy, the haters always mad at me, I know

[Verse 1]
Now why you keep me goin'? Why you keep me goin'?
Knowin' they can't stop a nigga
But I know they know and they already know it
Yeah, I know I'm on but I'll still off a nigga, woah
Before we even talkin', what's your offer, nigga? Woah
Make sure the bank account is looking proper, nigga
Make sure my niggas eatin' steak and lobster, nigga
We hustle hard, you hardly hustle, that's your problem, nigga
Question us and we can solve it, what's your problem, nigga?

[Verse 2]
Now why you keep me goin'? Why you keep me goin'?
Knowin' they can't stop a nigga
They quick to try and put my shit out in the open
Yeah, it's cool, I ain't forgot it, nigga
Now these famous bitches started blowin' up my line again
Basic bitches callin' 'cause they bank accounts is minusin', no

You know they suckin' dick if they in V.I.P
Told the waitress to roll up, bitch, forget the drinks
All this money in the air, the pussy follow me

Trap jumpin' out the jam, think I can fly
