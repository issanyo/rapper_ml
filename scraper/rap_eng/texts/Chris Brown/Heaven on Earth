[Intro: Chris Brown]
Woah, oh, woah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I believe in angels like I believe in you and I
And baby, I believe in God just as much as I believe you're mine
See, girl, the way the stars are shining on us make me feel like this is bigger than us
So why wait until I die? Oh, woah, yeah

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & Chris Brown]
You got the kinda smile that make me wanna make you laugh forever, ever, ever, ever
I'm bet that when I'm turning 99, we'll be together, gether, gether
I found Heaven on Earth, Earth, Earth, Earth, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Found Heaven on Earth, Earth, Earth, Earth
I found Heaven on Earth

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I done been through hell but you see, I make it out alive, oh, no
I'm used to the darkness, so go 'head and turn off them lights
See, girl the way the sun is shining on us, I feel like this is bigger than love
So why wait until I die? Oh, woah, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You got the kinda smile that make me wanna make you laugh forever, ever, ever, ever
I'm bet that when I'm turning 99, we'll be together, gether, gether
I found Heaven on Earth, Earth, Earth, Earth, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Found Heaven on Earth, Earth, Earth, Earth
I found Heaven on Earth

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
I found Heaven on Earth, no lie, Heaven on Earth, no lie
'Stead of hanging out at the club all night, I'ma just stay inside
I found Heaven on Earth, no lie, Heaven on Earth, no lie
'Stead of hanging out at the club all night, I'ma just let you ride

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Eric Bellinger]
You got the kinda smile that make me wanna make you laugh forever, ever, ever, ever (You got, laugh forever)
I'm bet that when I'm turning 99, we'll be together, gether, gether (We'll be together, woo)
I found Heaven on Earth, Earth, Earth, Earth, hey (Earth)
Hey, hey, hey
Found Heaven on Earth, Earth, Earth, Earth (I found Heaven on Earth)
I found Heaven on Earth
