[Verse 1]
I remember back in high school
Always been that nigga, been the nigga with the nice moves, yeah, yeah, yeah
Never hung with the nice dudes
Hung out with them niggas, robbing niggas for they shoes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All my niggas went to night school, dumb as fuck
Whippin' in the kitchen like a chemist, gettin' they money up
10, 20s, 50s and them 100s, yeah, yeah
I think I'm good for the summer, yeah, yeah
I just wanna let the top down and just ride
Feeling good, tryna live my life
I've been grindin' all year
Got the hammer right here, if a nigga try

[Chorus]
I'm so for real, this time
Let your candy rain on me, babe
Don't fuck it up it's on me, babe
If you fuck it up it's all on me, babe
And let's slip and let's slide, oh yeah
And if we sip, we can't drive (yeah)
So you gon' have to stay over (yeah)
And wait out this hangover (yeah, yeah)
Wait out this hangover

[Verse 2]
Don't be embarrassed
And don't be scared to show that thing
I love what you wearing, don't know who made it
PYT, you that pretty young thing
Girl, I ain't no Casanova
But I'ma give you everything you want
But you just can't be
Another baby mama blowing up my phone, no, no
Baby girl, don't you do that, don't be nosy (no)
Don't be lookin' through my phone, lookin' for them hoes 'cause you know me (no)
Don't be acting boujee in the coach seats (woo)
Don't be a hater, throwin' them stones from the nose bleeds (what?)
You gotta live life, do it, do it (do it, do it)
Go and get a cheque, do it, do it (do it, do it)
All this hate I'm getting used to it (yeah, yeah)
We the leaders of the new school, it ain't shit that I can't do

[Chorus]
I'm so for real, this time
Let your candy rain on me, babe (baby)
Don't fuck it up it's on me, babe (me, baby)
If you fuck it up it's all on me, babe (me, baby)
And let's slip and let's slide, oh yeah
And if we sip, we can't drive (yeah)
So you gon' have to stay over (yeah)
And wait out this hangover (yeah, yeah)
Wait out this hangover

[Verse 3]
You gotta stay over, oh wee, oh
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't leave (no)
'Cause it's a party after the party, you gon' see
She told me she ain't never fuck a nigga like me
I hit her from the back, pull up with the stick
Now she on the dick, pull out all her tracks
Cameras takin' pics, shit we lit

[Chorus]
I'm so for real, this time
Let your candy rain on me, babe (on me, baby)
Don't fuck it up it's on me, babe (me, baby)
If you fuck it up it's all on me, babe (all on me, baby)
Baby, and let's slip and let's slide, oh yeah
And if we sip, we can't drive (yeah)
So you gon' have to stay over (yeah)
And wait out this hangover (yeah, yeah)
Wait out this hangover (ooh)
