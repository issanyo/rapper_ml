[Intro]
It's the Cataracs

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You a dime, so beautiful
Top of the line, so unusual
Words can't define
You're running through my mind all day, day, day
I'm so happy you're mine, so beautiful
Top of the line, so unusual
Now I think it’s time, hey, shawty
I hope you don’t take this the wrong way

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl, you look better with the lights off (hey, hey)
Better with the lights off, ooh (hey, hey, oh, oh)
Girl, you look better with the lights off (hey, hey)
Better with the lights off, ooh (hey, hey)
Baby, girl, you're better with the lights off

[Verse 1: Legacy]
Oh, hey, Miss America
Oh, what you look so sad for?
Sweetheart, you only live one time
So put your fantasies on flash forward like
Gon' speed me up
Got a deadline 'cause you need me done
I hate your type, I love you too
I bite your swag 'cause I wanna do you
I can't blame you, babe
Obama your work clothes, girl, make a change
To your lingerie, right like that
That lalalala, make your eyes roll back
I mean you already fine though
I just wanna see you with the lights off
Every guy wanna know how it is
To clap off the lights and turn Khloé to Kim

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You a dime, so beautiful
Top of the line, so unusual
Words can't define
You're running through my mind all day, day, day
I'm so happy you're mine, so beautiful
Top of the line, so unusual
Now I think it’s time, hey shawty
I hope you don’t take this the wrong way

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl, you look better with the lights off (hey, hey)
Better with the lights off, ooh (hey, hey, oh, oh)
Girl, you look better with the lights off (hey, hey)
Better with the lights off, ooh (hey, hey)
Baby, girl, you're better with the lights off

[Verse 2: Ben J]
Uh, drive off take my girl to have a nice day
Shit was right, so I let her hang my way
You look cute, girl, what you wanna do, girl?
Drive to my house 'cause it's only me and you, girl (fo' sho')
Checking her out, she had to put her swag on
Acting too happy saying she ain't going back home
I'm like wow, whatever you say
But whatever you plan gotta be done at 8
Next stop, party at my place
Of course you welcome, girl, you ain't taking up space
We get there, shawty still looking right
She attacked me, but wait, let me dim the lights
Oh, you look different, she's like, "Boy, stop it"
No, I ain't playing, actually you more popping
She said, "Shocking, now that's really raw"
I don't know baby, but even with the lights off

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You a dime, so beautiful
Top of the line, so unusual
Words can't define
You're running through my mind all day, day, day
I'm so happy you're mine, so beautiful
Top of the line, so unusual
Now I think it’s time, hey shawty
I hope you don’t take this the wrong way

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl, you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off, ooh
Girl, you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off, ooh
Baby, girl, you're better with the lights off
Girl, you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off, ooh
Girl, you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off, ooh
Baby, girl, you're better with the lights off
