[Intro]
Oh, I feel caged in
I don't know if its the right house or the White House
You know?
You know I'm a somebody, and you're a nobody and this shit ain't for everybody
You know, I'm just tryin' to live

[Chorus]
All this coke in my house I know they said sumin'
All this coke in my house I know the feds comin'
All this coke in my house I feel caged in
I told my brother rock it up we some cave men
All this coke in my house I know they said sumin'
All this coke in my house I know the feds comin'
All this coke in my house I feel caged in
I told my brother rock it up we some cave men
