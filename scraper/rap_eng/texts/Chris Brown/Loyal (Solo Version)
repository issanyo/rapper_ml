[Intro]
Let me see
Let me see

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (for ya for ya, for ya for ya)
(Let me see) Ooooh These hoes ain’t loyal
(Let me see) Wo oh oh These hoes ain’t loyal
Yeah yeah, let me see

[Bridge]
Just got rich
Took a broke nigga’s bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don’t fuck with broke bitches

[Verse 1]
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to the Bay with me
Eyes closed, smoking marijuana
Rolling up that Bob Marley, I’m a rasta
She wanna do drugs
Smoke weed, get drunk
She wanna see a nigga trap
She wanna fuck all the rappers

[Chorus]
(Let me see aha oh) When a rich nigga want you (want you babe)
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (nothing no oh)
(Let me see) Ooooh These hoes ain’t loyal (not the end)
(Let me see) Wo oh oh These hoes ain’t loyal
Yeah yeah, let me see

[Verse 2]
Black girl with a big booty
If she a bad bitch, let’s get to it right away
We up in this club
Bring me the bottles
I know girl, that you came in this bitch with your man
That’s a no-no girl
All this money in the air
I wanna see you dance

[Bridge]
Just got rich (got rich)
Took a broke nigga’s bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don’t fuck with broke bitches

[Chorus]
(Let me see aha oh) When a rich nigga want you (want you babe)
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (Do nothing for you)
(Let me see) Ooooh These hoes ain’t loyal (Oh no oh)
(Let me see) Wo oh oh These hoes ain’t loyal
Yeah yeah, let me see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let me see
(Let me see aha oh) When a rich nigga want you (want you babe)
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (Oh my heart ohooh)
(Let me see) Ooooh These hoes ain’t loyal (In a real game)
(Let me see) Wo oh oh These hoes ain’t loyal (Ooooh ohooh)
Yeah yeah, let me see

[Verse 3]
Hoes ain't loyal, I'ma take a vacate
Private jet to Hawaii, I'm just tryna get laid
Got a whole bus full of bitches, nigga getting paid
Got too many freaks, I don't never need space
Two shots to the head, shawty said she need a chase
Babysitting now she see all my kids on her face
Rolex in the club, its a time in a place for everything
Getting faded minus the shades
It's the weekend, I ain't giving a fuck
And if they catch you with them drugs, you ain't get em from us
It's yo world baby, I'm just getting the nut
And I appreciate you for giving it up. hah!
(Let me see)

[Outro]
(Let me see aha oh) When a rich nigga want you (want you babe)
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (for ya for ya for ya for ya)
Ooooh These hoes ain’t loyal (loyal loyal loyal loyal)
Wo oh oh These hoes ain’t loyal
Yeah yeah
