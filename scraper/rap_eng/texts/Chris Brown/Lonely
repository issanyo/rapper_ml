[Intro: Tank]
Yeah, it's the general, C Breezy in the building
Yeah, it's that R&B money right here, huh, look, let's get it

[Verse 1: Tank]
I brought hoes, I did that
Walked up in this motherfucker like the kid back
You see the ice, you see the Range
Truth is I'm just doing this to cover up the pain
She left me, for good reason
I disrespected home, you can call it treason
I'm in bleeding ones what my heart is leaking
Don't walk with it tonight I think I'll be cheating

[Pre-Chorus: Tank]
I told my waitress keep them bottles coming, women all around me
I've been single for two or three weeks now, but who's counting?
Already replaced you with a new girl, new girl
She don't do for me the things you do, girl

[Chorus: Tank]
I'm still lonely, I'm still lonely
I'm steady trying to replace you with a new girl
In the end the only one I need is you, girl
I'm still

[Post-Chorus: Tank]
Thinking 'bout you, girl. I'm thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, damn, I'm thinking 'bout you
All these new girls, they ain't you, girl
Thinking 'bout you I'll be damned, I'm thinking 'bout you, yeah

[Verse 2: Tank & (Chris Brown)]
So many shots, just kill me now
But honey shed these tears of a fucking cloud
My heart is racing, could be the model
Or the fact that she up in here looking good without me
Look at them bottles them red bottoms, who was sponsoring that? (Who was sponsoring that?)
I'm gonna speak and try to make peace but look at this damn crowd (look at this damn crowd)
Look at this damn crowd, look at this damn crowd (nigga, just look at this damn crowd)
Yeah, it's popping but if you with it we can leave now

[Pre-Chorus: Tank]
I told my waitress keep them bottles coming, women all around me
I've been single for two or three weeks now, but who's counting?
Already replaced you with a new girl, new girl
She don't do for me the things you do, girl

[Chorus: Tank & Chris Brown]
I'm still lonely, I'm still lonely (still lonely, still lonely, still lonely, still lonely)
I'm steady trying to replace you with a new girl
In the end the only one I need is you, girl (you, girl)
I'm still

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Thinking 'bout you, damn, I'm thinking 'bout you (thinking 'bout you, baby)
Thinking 'bout you, got a nigga thinking 'bout you, yeah
All these new girls, new girl, they ain't you, girl, you, girl
Thinking 'bout you, I'll be damned, I'm thinking 'bout you, yeah

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Nigga off in this club (club), got a hundred girls in my VIP (right)
I bet all of them wanna fuck (yikes), but only your ass can get to me
I'm throwing up this money, hella money spent, these fake ass nigga on that funny shit
I'ma get this on your level since you wanna trip, I'ma give a new girl the dick as your punishment (ah)
Now I'm back up in this club with my shirt off and my chain on
And I'm licking, licking, licking her booty, got that bomb shit on this Tank song
No matter how many girls wanna do me, I just want you back in my Range Rover
On the road, no clothes, on the pole, game over

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I told my waitress keep them bottles coming, women all around me
It's so many pretty ladies, nigga stopped counting
I said, already replaced you with a new girl, yeah
She don't do for me the things you do, girl

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tank]
I'm still lonely, I'm still lonely (still lonely, still lonely, still lonely, still lonely)
I'm steady trying to replace you with a new girl (new girl)
In the end the only one I need is you, girl
I'm still

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Thinking 'bout you, damn, I'm thinking 'bout you (thinking 'bout you, baby)
Thinking 'bout you, got a nigga thinking 'bout you, yeah
All these new girls, new girl, they ain't you, girl, you, girl
Thinking 'bout you, I'll be damned, I'm thinking 'bout you, yeah

[Outro: Tank & Chris Brown]
Still lonely, I'm still lonely
New girl, bottles popping, fast life
I'm still lonely, alone
Yeah, haha
Yeah, haha
