[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
You're a goddess in the bedroom, devil in them skintights
Drug that, I'm hooked to, but it's okay, I'll be alright
Tried my best to please you, show you what it means to be a victim of love
So turn on that red light, oh, turn on that red light, ooh, eh

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
We gon' be bumping and grinding
Seems like you're ready to sex me, baby, baby
And I'm feeling on your booty, driving me crazy
Half on a baby
Cause your body's calling me
And with your permission let me start your ignition
Don't you know that you're reminding me of a song on 12 Play
You're like a song on 12 Play

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Fucking with an R&B thug, you gon' have the greatest sex
Do you mind if I stroke you up? Baby girl, imagine that
Dripping that honey love, I'mma hit it hard from the back
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, just like that
Do your body like a real freak
Have a little private fiesta, fiesta
Somebody's girl is on my body naked, shaking
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, yeah baby eh

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
We gon' be bumping and grinding
Seems like you're ready to sex me, baby, baby
And I'm feeling on your booty, driving me crazy
Half on a baby
Cause your body's calling me, oh yeah, your body's calling me, baby
And with your permission let me start your ignition
Don't you know that you're reminding me of a song on 12 Play
You're like a song on 12 Play

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Okay, foreplay, that's child's play, making love is my fort√©
Shots of you when I'm thirsty, damn right, I'mma eat that pussy
Clothes all in the background, I give her back shot, I don't back down
She likes her hair pulled, that ass slapped around and the neighbors screaming out "Keep it down"

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
Baby turn on the red light tonight, lil mama, it'll be alright
I just wanna be all on you, do it 'til we both can't move
Your body, your neck, your breasts, your ass, girl
Sweat dripping on my body, feel like this my last girl, so tonight

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
We gon' be bumping and grinding
Seems like you're ready to sex me, baby, baby
And I'm feeling on your booty, driving me crazy
Half on a baby
Cause your body's calling me, it's calling me babe
And with your permission let me start your ignition
Don't you know that you're reminding me of a song on 12 Play
You're like a song on 12 Play

[Outro: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
Oh na na na na na na, down low, down low
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby
Keep it on the down low, down low
