[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I got 50 goons with me but I'm still a good dude
Mean muggin' but I'm in a good mood
Ha, work it out, what that shit do
No hands, popsicle, call it BlueTooth
Hot damn, I;m on my grind right
My money stupid bad, I get your mind right
Me without no paper, that don’t sound right
But me fucking you later, yeah, that sound right
And when I put that thing on her, she gon' night, night
Got your girl sleeping all on me
She passed out out out out out out out out out

[Hook: Kevin Cossom & Chris Brown]
Nigga itis
Where the smoke? Where the weed? Where the lighters?
Your girl sleeping on me, nigga itis
You better keep it locked down, nigga, write this
Give her D, she pass out, nigga itis
Nigga itis, nigga itis
You know I got that gold touch, I'm Midas
Well give you this D and pass her out out out out out

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
A nigga got a present for you right here undercovers
I don’t care what you cuffin', I just want you undercover
Gold ticket right here, yeah baby, that's the rubber
And even the side bitch get the dick like I love her
Oh yeah, I’m sorry if I get to bragging
In my room, you know it's 'bout to happen
Soon as we’re done, you'll be napping
Girl, got a donk, that's my assets
And when I put that thing on her, she gon' night, night
Got your girl sleeping all on me
She passed out out out out out out out out out

[Hook: Kevin Cossom & Chris Brown]
