[Verse 1]
In a world full of people, why do I feel so damn alone?
On a mountain so high, oh I wish I had a clone
I look up in the sky and realize this is where I belong
And if I'm really here, then why do I feel so gone?

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin' no
If I ain't trippin', why you trippin', what you trippin' for?
No I ain't worried 'bout a thing, I'mma still be here
I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin' no

[Chorus]
I could have all the money in the world
But I won't change, I won't change
I could have all the girls in the world
But I won't change, I won't change
It's just me and my team
OHB

[Vese 2]
Don't need to look back to the past when I can see inside the future
Girl I will carry you on my back if you're down, if you're down for the ride
We can go so high through the sky, ain't nobody touchin' us now
They can run they mouth all they want, ain't nobody stoppin' us now

[Pre-Chorus]
But I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin' no
If I ain't trippin', why you trippin', what you trippin' for?
No I ain't worried 'bout a thing, I'mma still be here
I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin' no

[Chorus]
I could have all the money in the world
But I won't change, I won't change
I could have all the girls in the world
But I won't change, I won't change
Baby be on my team
OHB

[Bridge]
Baby can we do this? Cause right now I'm 'bout to take it all off, forgive me
You better not lose this smile
You know that pretty little face that you make when you want it now
I like it better when you're mad, I won't complain

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin' no
If I ain't trippin', why you trippin', what you trippin' for?
No I ain't worried 'bout a thing, I'mma still be here
I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin' no

[Chorus]
I could have all the money in the world
But I won't change, I won't change
I could have all the girls in the world
But I won't change, I won't change
It's just me and my team
OHB
