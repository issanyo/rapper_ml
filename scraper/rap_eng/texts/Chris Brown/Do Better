[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I don't know why I even try cause you don't want this no more, I would rather leave before I hurt you
And I would have died long ago if I didn't have my faith, I see you're starting to hate me, I see it in your face
My home don't feel like home, just like my heart is empty
You change the number on your phone, so when I call, you ain't gotta listen

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
And all your girls think that I ain't shit
And they the same ones lost in the club, them bitches is basic
Now I'm number one that's lost in love, I can't take it
I'm on a knee, you're gonna see a grown man cry, I won't lie

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm starting to hate me a little more and more each day
I don't know me, it's like I can't get out of my own way
And you don't love me, you don't love me
If I knew better, I would do it better

[Verse 2: Brandy]
Looking at the names on your list and I can't find me
I'm deep underwater, are you gon' let me drown?
I see youâ€™re happy now, you're the life of the party, acting out
Ain't seen you in months, you ain't call me once

[Pre-Chorus: Brandy]
And all your boys say that I ain't shit
And they the same ones lost in the club, niggas is basic
Yeah, and I'm the one who's lost in love and I can't take it
I'm on my knees, don't you hate to see me cry? I won't lie

[Chorus: Brandy & Chris Brown]
I'm starting to hate me a little more and more each day
I don't know me, it's like I can't get out of my own way
And you don't love me, you don't love me
If I knew better, I would do it better

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Brandy]
Thinking 'bout you and I, thinking 'bout you and I
My heart's beating in slow motion, knowing that it's over
Thoughts got me thinking 'bout suicide, baby, this is do or die
When you told me it's over, ain't no point in being sober
All I wanna do is fade away, fade away
I hope that God will forgive me cause I know that you ain't gon' miss me
Baby girl I won't try say my goodbyes
You ain't gotta shed a tear for me, baby girl don't cry

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Brandy]
I'm starting to hate me a little more and more each day
I don't know me, it's like I can't get out of my own way
And you don't love me, you don't love me
If I knew better, I would do it better

[Outro: Brandy & Chris Brown]
I would do better, I would do better
I would do better, I would do better
I would do better, I would do better
I would do better, I would do better
I would do better
