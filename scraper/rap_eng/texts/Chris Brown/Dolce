[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
They say, "Fuck you, where your friends at?"
We say, "Fuck it, where the bands at?"
We say, "Bitch, you buy the car? No"
I tell the bitch I love the bottle
Bitch you be busy, why you callin'?
See that bitch is poppin' bars now

[Hook: Chris Brown]

Baby, you the finest, booty bouncin'
That's why I put you in designer, I'm movin' mountains (BRICKS)
Haters get the fuck from round, we don't fuck around
You know when you hear that chopper sound, somebody got laid down
Hasta luego
Play with the bricks like they Legos
Too drunk, I'mma fuck up my kidneys
Come take out my brain like Play-Doh
All my killers, they do what I say so
All my bitches say dame un beso
Got a bitch who just do what I need
Hold a burner and roll up my weed and mind her business
It's hard to tell if she really loves me
Or is it the Dolce
I'm too fucked up at the moment
To even recognize your face, we was too fucked up

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Pourin' Dolce, Dolce yeah
Why you playin' round? Need to bring that body here

Sellin' pussy like it's real estate
Puttin' jugs on the interstate
Old clip out the H-Town
On the southside with my nigga Trey
You niggas is foolish, you soundin' so stupid
Just left from my jeweller
Like what is you doin'?
Just got back from tour, I'm livin' like Lucious

Two hoes, call it two play
Man down at the trap house
Tell 'em take mine, we do not play
OHB, that's the set nigga
Father sellin' them bricks now
Got a redbone on the westside
That bang head like TIP nigga
