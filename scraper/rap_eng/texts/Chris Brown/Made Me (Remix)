[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Late night got me creepin' with your damn ol lady
Had that pussy poppin' all in my new black Mercedes
Before I walk up in the club, these nigga better pay me
Hundred condoms in the condo, I can't have no babies
I can't have no babies, I can't have no babies
A hundred condoms in the condo, I can't have no babies
I can't have no babies, I can't have no babies
A hundred condoms in the condo, I can't have no babies

[Verse 1: Trey Songz & Chris Brown]
Baby, we Virginia boys that's that shit that made me (2 up, 2 down)
We be ridin' in that foreign, drive them bitches crazy (2 up, 2 down)
Like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on any time you want
It's Breezy and Trigga Songz, make them take it off
Oh yeah, I came to kiss on the kitty don't want to wait
Lickin' it clean, makin' that pussy my dinner plate
Give a little taste and bet it feel great gettin' face on the interstate
You nervous, got me swervin', let me switch to the middle lane
This that after party, me inside your body
And you know who you came with, yeah, yeah
Oh, no you ain't got to worry about me, my nigga
No, I get your main bitch on the team, my nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Late night got me creepin' with your damn ol lady
Had that pussy poppin' all in my new black Mercedes
Before I walk up in the club, these nigga better pay me
Hundred condoms in the condo, I can't have no babies
I can't have no babies, I can't have no babies
A hundred condoms in the condo, I can't have no babies
I can't have no babies, I can't have no babies
A hundred condoms in the condo, I can't have no babies

[Bridge: Trey Songz & Chris Brown]
Oh baby, I know what you want
I know you want it, baby
No baby, that's why I strap it up
Girl, you talking crazy

[Verse 2: Trey Songz & Chris Brown]
Oh oh oh, she was from the ghetto
No no no, now she walkin' in stilettos
Yeah yeah yeah, black and white like a piano
Fiend for the dick so I took her to the bando
I'm in love with your body baby I'ma say it
I get down on my knees, baby, like I'm prayin'
Make you my sex slave, don't you run away
Makin' you cum with it when I'm done with it, you gon' wanna stay

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Late night got me creepin' with your damn ol lady
Had that pussy poppin' all in my new black Mercedes
Before I walk up in the club, these nigga better pay me
Hundred condoms in the condo, I can't have no babies
I can't have no babies, I can't have no babies
A hundred condoms in the condo, I can't have no babies
I can't have no babies, I can't have no babies
A hundred condoms in the condo, I can't have no babies
