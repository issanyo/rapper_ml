[Intro: Noah]
Which one you gon' get, man?
I don't know, man, so many to choose from
Chris Brown
Noah

[Verse 1: Noah]
I'ma make it rain like sprinkle sprinkle
That boy Chevy goes twinkle twinkle
Hop out like a G, say pleased to meet you
Can we elope and go smoke somewhere peaceful?
It's the NOAH, baby, kiss me, hug me
The music man, girls they love me
So which one of y'all gon' sip some crystal?
If you ain't old enough then holla at Chris Brown

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Everyone of y'all are looking like
You wanna do something freaky tonight
Tell your man you ain't feeling the same
You wanna be free, free to mingle tonight
If I could, I'd take all of you
To a place where we all could do
Something that your momma wouldn't approve
Make ya get down, show me what's good
Let me see how they do it in your hood

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Which one of y'all want it?
Which one of y'all need it?
Which one of y'all?
Which one tryna get this?
Which one of y'all?
Which, which one?
Which one of y'all taking that off for me?
Which one of y'all want it?
Which one of y'all need it?
Which one of y'all?
Which one tryna get this?
Which one of y'all?
Which, which one?
Which one of y'all taking that off for me?

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Come here, come here walk for me
Let me see what they be telling me
'Bout that thing, I just had to know
Baby, what's your name? Or do you wanna play tonight?
Come here, or do you like the beat?
Talk to you like you coming wit me
Girl, I already know, baby, what's your thing?
If you want it you can get it tonight

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Which one of y'all want it?
Which one of y'all need it?
Which one of y'all?
Which one tryna get this?
Which one of y'all?
Which, which one?
Which one of y'all taking that off for me?
Which one of y'all want it?
Which one of y'all need it?
Which one of y'all?
Which one tryna get this?
Which one of y'all?
Which, which one?
Which one of y'all taking that off for me?

[Verse 3: Noah]
You can count on CB or me to please ya
Fly you to Italy for a piece of pizza
Back to America, leave with leisure
G4 cash boy, you don't need your Visa
'Cause you're my candy girl, my now and later
Just bring your purse and what your momma gave ya
Baby, I'm a player but the ball's in your court
Now let me see ya strip to ya bras and boy shorts
I'm grittin' my teeth like I need a pack of gum
Applebottoms got you lookin' like Bonnita apple bum
I'm for Dacater, baby, tell me where you from
Come, come whisper in your ear, let me tell you somethin'
The way your booty hop, I think a rabbit's in your pants
We can travel to Japan, then Africa to France
I can have it in your plans if you tell me in advance
So baby, use your brain and take advantage of the chance

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Which one of y'all want it?
Which one of y'all need it?
Which one of y'all?
Which one tryna get this?
Which one of y'all?
Which, which one?
Which one of y'all taking that off for me?
Which one of y'all want it?
Which one of y'all need it?
Which one of y'all?
Which one tryna get this?
Which one of y'all?
Which, which one?
Which one of y'all taking that off for me?
Which one of y'all want it?
Which one of y'all need it?
Which one of y'all?
Which one tryna get this?
Which one of y'all?
Which, which one?
Which one of y'all taking that off for me?
Which one of y'all want it?
Which one of y'all need it?
Which one of y'all?
Which one tryna get this?
Which one of y'all?
Which, which one?
Which one of y'all taking that off for me?
