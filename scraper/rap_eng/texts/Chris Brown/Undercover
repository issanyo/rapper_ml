[Intro: DJ Drama]
Baby, I won't tell if you won't tell
I mean, we could keep it on the hush hush
Let me tell you

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I ain't gonna lie, I'm fiending 'cause I need it
And I'm digging you a lot, now you still catching feelings
But I'm feeling on your spots, no kidding when I hit it
I'll be licking on ya spine, playing with your mind
I ain't gonna stop, when I finish I be in it
I be fucking with the lights on, that's the shit that I'm on
Give it all I got, your body and my body
We be fooling, scratching, screaming now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Hey shawty, where we going? (Ayy)
Nobody has to know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover, cover cover, cover cover
Hey shawty, where we going? (Ayy)
Nobody has to know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover, cover cover, cover cover

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
One thing you should know about me is I never play to lose, huh
Always aim high and rarely obey the rules
Never tell my business, if I did, it make the news
They say, "Time is like money," you should come and pay your dues
And come kick it, can I get a minute? Maybe an hour, huh
Would you let me peak my head in for a second while you shower? Huh
I bet you got some real good power, if you feel me
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, you know just what's gon' heal me, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Hey shawty, where we going? (Ayy)
Nobody has to know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover, cover cover, cover cover
Hey shawty, where we going? (Ayy)
Nobody has to know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover, cover cover, cover cover (Undercover shawty)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I said, "Excuse me Mrs. Officer, can you go undercover for me?"
Ain't enough liquor in your cup, the waitress here, then let her pour it up
I'm tryna get you drunk as fuck
Take her to my crib, then I lock her in them handcuffs
Panties off, stupid booty
Ready for war, Call of Duty
She said I got the right to remain silent and
I've got to give it to her rough but I better not get violent, ha
Girl, my chain feel like an anchor
And when I told you to use your head, I ain't want you to be no thinker
And we ain't gon' waste this drink up, these haters sore like cankles
While I'm countin' all this paper and my ears shine like twinkle, twinkle, ha
Big star, get in my car, I don't valet that
You a weak nigga, pussy in the street 'cause you're an alleycat
And I'm loyal to my fans 'cause I love 'em
So girl, if you're a fan, you can meet me undercovers like

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Hey shawty, where we going? (Ayy)
Nobody has to know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover, cover cover, cover cover
Hey shawty, where we going? (Ayy)
Nobody has to know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover, cover cover, cover cover (Undercover shawty)
