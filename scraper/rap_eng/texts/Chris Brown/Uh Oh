[Chorus]
Uh oh, uh oh, there goes another one
Shawty wanna rock with me
Don't stand against the wall, girl, take it to the floor
Shawty, keep it low for me
Uh oh, uh oh, there goes another one
You say you wanna stall with me
Don't trill against the wall, let's take it to the floor
Show me what you got for me

[Verse 1]
The night is young so let's get this party started
Show 'em how to get down on the floor
Ladies looking sexy from the couple I done spotted
Man, their bodies were outta control
Hormones racing and females chasing
Man, can't stop feeling the beat
Girl, bodies shaking like she's seizing, faking
Now I know she getting low with me

[Chorus]
Uh oh, uh oh, there goes another one
Shawty wanna rock with me
Don't stand against the wall, girl, take it to the floor
Shawty, keep it low for me
Uh oh, uh oh, there goes another one
You say you wanna stall with me
Don't trill against the wall, let's take it to the floor
Show me what you got for me

[Verse 2]
It's crack-a-lacking, now it's krump up in the party
Finger licking down to the bone
Who's this mean mugging me, acting so retarded?
I'ma have to throw some blow
Players hate me 'cause the ladies crave me
And they getting up off they feet
They coming over and they ass is swole
But they wanna rumble with me

[Chorus]
Uh oh, uh oh, there goes another one
Shawty wanna rock with me
Don't stand against the wall, girl, take it to the floor
Shawty, keep it low for me
Uh oh, uh oh, there goes another one
You say you wanna stall with me
Don't trill against the wall, let's take it to the floor
Show me what you got for me
