[Intro: RichGirl & Chris Brown]
If you in the spot you can do this
Put your hands up top to the music
Just wave, wave, wave
Just wave, wave, wave
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, wait
Oh, oh, wait

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & RichGirl]
Hey pretty lady, what's your name?
Got a pretty little body, I just wanna say
Do you have some time for you to come play?
And baby, I know the perfect place
Hold up, wait little daddy
Do you think that that's the way to get at me?
There ain't no need to go on and on
What do you mean I'm going on and on?

[Pre-Chorus: RichGirl & Chris Brown]
Boy, I know you're trying to get in my jeans
Be a cold day in hell, that's not happening
But I, I just came for love, girl, that ain't me hold up
Ain't tryna beg for none
Girl, I know other guys, they're not quite like me
Don't know how to do good
And treat you right like me, but I will
Boy, you're not gonna get my... why? Haha

[Chorus: RichGirl & Chris Brown]
Let's see how far you gon' get
Ain't no other guy been there yet
I usually smile and wave, wave, wave, wave
Said I'm gon' get this far as you let it
Girl, I can promise that you won't regret it
I usually smile and wave, wave, wave, wave

[Verse 2: RichGirl & Chris Brown]
Hey baby boy, you got me,  do I?
Thinking to my self, you're sexy
I don't know what'cha you gon' do, oh
If I start to push up on you, yeah
Hold up, wait little mama
Do you finna you can deal with the showstopper?
Boy, you ain't impressing me, that's not what I'm tryna do
So why are you pressing me? I'm tryna get into you

[Pre-Chorus: RichGirl & Chris Brown]
Boy, I know that you're trying to get in my jeans (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Be a cold day in hell, that's not happening
But I, I just came for love, girl, that ain't me hold up (yeah right, oh, oh, oh)

And treat you right like me, but I will, oh I will
You will, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: RichGirl & Chris Brown]
