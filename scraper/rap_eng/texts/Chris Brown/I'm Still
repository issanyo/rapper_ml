[Hook]
I know a lotta niggas in here probably hate me right now
Girl, I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that
That ain't gon' change a thing, still gon' do my thing
I'm still, still gon' go get mine
Still gon' keep on winnin'
Still gon' keep it 100 every time
I'm still, I'm still
Even when them nigga throw shots (bang, bang)
I'm still, I'm still
Still gon' end up on top
I'm still
(Pussy ass niggas stop hatin')

[Verse 1]
You niggas mad 'cause you fuckin' with them regular hoes
And ain't none better than my Asian
Hold up, wait, nigga fuckin' with my patience
'Cause I'm that nigga, give a fuck about a racist
If I gotta pull the trigger, I'ma kill a nigga
I'll even pay for the funeral arrangements
I'ma fuck your baby mama, she gon' take dick
And when your kids see Chris, they gon' take pics
I'm number one in the life 'cause I make hits
These real diamonds, your's Hollywood fake shit
If you trip, banana clip
This shit'll make a nigga fuckin' go ape shit
I'm 24, yeah, a nigga gettin' older
Don't give a fuck, my heart gettin' colder
Now every nigga in the industry done fucked my bitch
And all my niggas said, "I told ya"
Now all these rap niggas wanna be political
Fuck that, nigga I'm a real lyrical killer
Spit sick shit, get a cold
Who the fuck you think your bitch is cookin' dinner for?
A couple months with your girl and bitch is on a centre-fold
Seven days of the week, I got ten of those
And then I pass it to the homies
They gon' bang, bang, run a train
Yeah nigga 'cause she been a hoe
