[Intro]
They say pain is growth, I hear you
I just wanna make it stop, all this hurt, fuck

[Verse 1]
Waking up to my high, empty place (I'm all alone)
Messages in my phone, telling me that you're gone
Didn't even give me one chance to explain (tell me why)
I guess it didn't matter at all, matter at all (yeah, I know I fucked up, baby)

[Pre-Chorus]
She was just one night, she was just one night
Baby, you were my whole life, you were my whole life
Wish I could go back then and undo what I've done
That would be impossible, oh yeah

[Chorus]
But if you could see what my eyes can see (oh)
You would see what you mean to me (oh)
If you could feel the way my heart is beating
You can feel my energy, you keep coming back for me, you can feel my energy
I wouldn't be the enemy
I don't wanna be the enemy

[Verse 2]
I cannot undo what I have done (oh, what I've done)
I know you don't understand, how I couldn't resist it (understand, no)
Especially since I knew you were the one, girl, I knew you were the one
Should have been the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
She was just one night, she was just one night
Baby, you were my whole life, you were my whole life
Wish I could go back then and undo what I've done
That would be impossible, oh yeah (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
But if you could see what my eyes can see (my eyes can see, oh)
You would see what you mean to me (baby, yeah, oh)
If you could feel the way my heart is beating (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You can feel my energy, you keep coming back for me, you can feel my energy (my energy)

[Verse 3]
I guess this is the end of me (no, no, no)
'Cause this where we fall apart (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But if I fix these broken pieces of your bleeding heart (oh, oh)
For us to be the enemy
'Cause I don't wanna be your enemy
Do you remember when we fell in love? (Love)

[Pre-Chorus]
She was just one night, she was just one night
And you were my whole life, you were my whole life

[Chorus]
But if you could see what my eyes can see (oh)
You would see what you mean to me (oh)
If you could feel the way my heart is beating
You can feel my energy, you keep coming back for me, you can feel my energy (oh woah)
