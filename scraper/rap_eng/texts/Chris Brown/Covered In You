[Intro]
Oh, oh
Ooh, na na
Na na na, girl

[Verse 1]
Hold on to me tight, yeah
And if you feel any pressure, that's alright, alright
There's a leak in your Levi, it's on the verge of caving in
But I'm prepared if it breaks, baby, so whenever you feel it coming, don't fight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, never been scared to get wet
No umbrella, you can rain all night, oh woah, woah
And go ahead and drench me with your body
By the time you're finished

[Chorus]
Baby, I'll be covered in you, yeah, yeah
Covered in you
Ooh, you know we'll be through
'Cause I'll be covered in you

[Verse 2]
Get yours and I'll get mine, yeah, yeah
You know I always hit your spots, baby, every time (time)
Oh yeah, feel it drip drop and your bottles turn to oceans, you know I won't stop 'til I feel it  overflow (drip drop)
Tell me, tell me, baby, would you mind if I just jump right in there, take a dive?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, never been scared to get wet
No umbrella, you can rain all night, oh woah, woah
And go ahead and drench me with your body
By the time you're finished baby

[Chorus]
I'll be covered in you, yeah, yeah
Covered in you
Ooh, you know we'll be through
'Cause I'll be covered in you
I ain't running, keep it coming
'Til I'm covered, baby, covered in you
Ooh, you know we'll be through
Until I'll be covered in you

[Outro]
Covered in you, you
Wanna be covered, covered in you, you (yeah, yeah)
You, woah, woah, in your love, baby
Covered in you
