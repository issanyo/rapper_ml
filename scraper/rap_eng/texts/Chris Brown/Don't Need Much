[Verse 1]
When I see you now, yes I paid attention
And I asked around, tryna get the deal
And I'm on you now, bet you anything
I'll turn your life around, girl, I'm something real

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you got your doubts
You had a little this and you had a little that
But baby, hear me out
Listen while I break it down

[Chorus]
Don't need that much, you just need a little guidance, you need a little I in your life
You don't need that much, lil mama, you just need a little talk, you just need a young boss in your life
Don't need that much, you just need a little this, you need a little Chris in your life
You don't need that much, lil mama, you just need a young G, you just need a little me in your life

[Verse 2]
Don't worry 'bout the trips I take
Got shots with or who I am
Please believe I'm the one that you need
When it's time to put something on your wrist or your feet
I'm a G, but first, I gotta get to know you
First I wanna show you, first I wanna hold you
That I got the love to make you feel
Just like the diamond you are

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you got your doubts
You had a little this and you had a little that, yeah, girl
But baby, hear me out, ooh
I'ma have to break it down

[Chorus]
Don't need that much, you just need a little guidance, you need a little I in your life
You don't need that much, lil mama, you just need a little talk, you just need a young boss in your life
Don't need that much, you just need a little this, you need a little Chris in your life
You don't need that much, lil mama, you just need a young G, you just need a little me in your life
Don't need that much, you just need a little guidance, you need a little I in your life
You don't need that much, lil mama, you just need a little talk, you just need a young boss in your life
Don't need that much, you just need a little this, you need a little Chris in your life
You don't need that much, lil mama, you just need a young G, you just need a little me in your life

[Bridge]
I ain't tryna play ya, matter fact, I'm tryna date ya
Girl, I ain't tryna fool ya, matter fact, I'm tryna school ya
Girl, I ain't tryna trick ya 'cause I just wanna get with ya
Say it again, with ya, say it again, with ya

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you got your doubts
You had a little this and you had a little that
But baby, hear me out
You don't need it, you don't it

[Chorus]
Don't need that much, you just need a little guidance, you need a little I in your life
You don't need that much, lil mama, you just need a little talk, you just need a young boss in your life
Don't need that much, you just need a little this, you need a little Chris in your life
You don't need that much, lil mama, you just need a young G, you just need a little me in your life
Don't need that much, you just need a little guidance, you need a little I in your life
You don't need that much, lil mama, you just need a little talk, you just need a young boss in your life
Don't need that much, you just need a little this, you need a little Chris in your life
You don't need that much, lil mama, you just need a young G, you just need a little me in your life

[Outro]
Need a little me, me, me, yeah, haha
