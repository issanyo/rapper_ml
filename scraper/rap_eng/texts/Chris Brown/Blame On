[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't play me to the left you know
'fore I pull up with that thing on me
I'm shooting, aiming for the neck, oh
And ain't nobody finna blame on me

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
...Blame on
Call your bitch, she coming over
She gon' bring her friend too
They gon' pop and bend it over
Like that pussy brand new
Get her an Uber when it's over
They just hop up in the Coupe
What you gon' do?
'cause you can't really put the blame on

[Verse: Chris Brown]
Oh, what your problem lil mama, hop up
'cause i'ma shoot up the roof
You need to stop it
Before I make your mama really miss you
Got a Ghost, Impala, really big bullets and a couple masseuse
I hit your bitch on her body

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't play me to the left you know
'fore I pull up with that thing on me
I'm shooting, aiming for the neck, oh
And ain't nobody finna blame on me

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
...Blame on
Call your bitch, she coming over
She gon' bring her friend too
They gon' pop and bend it over
Like that pussy brand new
Get her an Uber when it's over
They just hop up in the Coupe
What you gon' do?
'cause you can't really put the blame on

[Verse: Sage the Gemini]
I learn that family don't always matter (matter)
I send the shots around, throw 'em, name them shotta (woah)
I'm just trying to buy me a big place (place)
I'm just trying to buy me a lawyer help me beat the case
I'm just tryna fuck you, let you lead the way (the way)
And if we can't make it to the bed, do it on the way

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't play me to the left you know
'fore I pull up with that thing on me (on me)
I'm shooting, aiming for the neck, oh
And ain't nobody finna blame on me

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
...Blame on
Call your bitch, she coming over
She gon' bring her friend too
They gon' pop and bend it over
Like that pussy brand new
Get her an Uber when it's over
They just hop up in the Coupe
What you gon' do?
'cause you can't really put the blame on

[Verse: Rich The Kid]
I might slide in it
I like bad bitches...
