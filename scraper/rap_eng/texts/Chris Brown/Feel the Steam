[Intro: Elephant Man & Chris Brown]
Hmm, Elephant Man
C. Breeze
Chris Brown for the ladies
Baby look stunnin', sweat runnin', mash it up
I told her, I told her, I told her, I told her, burn it up
I told her, I told her, I told her, I told her, burn it up
Before all the club is on fire, no top
Whine up, whine up, watchin' her perspire

[Verse 1: Elephant Man & Chris Brown]
How the way you actin' make my temperature rise
And I could not do because she can't fit in on your size
I told her she man a look, she form a criticized
She got the fire lever on 'til move to the side (oh, oh)
Champion papi, daddy, can you see me roll?
By my body sweatin', see me have a weddin' room
Don't bother act too sweat when you pon to this song (oh, oh)
When you're done with Elephant you're gone  to Chris Brown, hey (oh, oh)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Elephant Man]
Can you feel the steam? (Woo, hey)
Hot make you wanna scream (make her wanna scream)
Shawty wanna leave with me (wanna leave with me)
I know just what you need (what you need)
Girl, let me make your body sweat (make your body sweat)
Come on, come on make your body wet (run the night)
I'ma make your body drip sweat (take it off)
Girl, whine 'til you drip sweat

[Verse 2: Elephant Man & Chris Brown]
Hey, I know you into me 'bout no foolishness
If she want me fi that booty, how she pull with this
Don't make me leap on your head, I jump and twist
Come here to me, don't want to hear your drunken pleas
Bring it over here and make it out the front door
Timin' ain't forever, Ele' gon' pop through
Ain't no time to bond, you see how I roll
So baby, when you're ready, when you're ready to come

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Elephant Man]
Can you feel the steam? (Hey)
Hot make you wanna scream (make her wanna scream)
Shawty wanna leave with me (wanna leave with me)

Girl, let me make your body sweat (make your body sweat)
Come on, come on make your body wet (run the night)
I'ma make your body drip sweat (take it off)
Girl, whine 'til you drip sweat

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Elephant Man]
We can get it on until the early morning
Feel your body calling, oh, oh

Make me apply the pressure
We can get it on until the early morning
Hear your body calling, oh, woah, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Elephant Man]
Can you feel the steam? Oh (Hey)

[Verse 3: Elephant Man & Chris Brown]
All in the club, go outside to my car
Say she never knew this thing could reach so far (oh, oh)
Finally she told me to get pon di car (oh, oh)
She wanna get to know me so get to me car
I can feel your body temperature, you love to turn my meter (make your body sweat)
My meter, plus when you're drunk, can you undo my meter? (make your body sweat)
Booty pull, workin' like a sweeper, booty shaker
Move her like a radiator

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Elephant Man]
Can you feel the steam? (Hey)
Hot make you wanna scream (make her wanna scream)
Shawty wanna leave with me (wanna leave with me)
