Holla holla

[Verse 1: Justine Skye]
You don’t love me like that (like that)
Send you a text, you don’t write back (nah)
I got 99 problems, no
I don’t give a fuck so I drop it low
Uh, you don’t love me like you used to
Uh, shit changed, baby we through
Nigga, give me all my time back
You blow, and the Rollie on your wrist woah
Yeah, ass on fleek, know you lookin’ for it (lookin’ for)
Eyes on me, you see them Tom Fords?
Now you see me dancing with another guy
Pussy nigga, you ain’t on the same level (yeah)
See me in a range, Porsche 911 (911)
Got a new man, so I know you jealous (yeah)
I ain't worried ‘bout a thing, tryna get my lettuce (money)
Baby hol’ up, wait a minute
Now you want it all back?

[Chorus: Justine Skye, Chris Brown & Both]
Cause you got the best of my love, you got the best of my love(woah-oh)
Cause you got the best of my love, gave you the best of my love(woah-oh)
Cause you got the best of my love, you got the best of my love(woah-oh)
Cause you got the best of my love, gave you the best of my love

[Post-Chorus: Justine Skye]
Holla, holla
I'm bad though, oh
Niggas spending on me
But don't be mad though, oh-oh
In time you'll see

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You swing that ponytail I'ma pull it
I put my tongue on that monkey just like the bullet
The way I'm taking that pussy call me a bullet
Put that condom, on the top of my head, I'm 'bout to pull it down
Niggas say they be jumping, hopping up out the roof (roof)
Niggas saying that I'm balling, like damn that nigga can shoot (shoot)
I was chillin' at the crib, full of hoes and Netflix
Making birds disappear, now for my next trick
I'm a self Maybach nigga, you a Lexus
Niggas with the bullshit, pulling off yo exit (exit)
If you want that body bag, yeah it's on me (on me)
Cause I'm the only real singer nigga that's a real G
500, woah!

[Chorus: Justine Skye, Chris Brown & Both]
Cause you got the best of my love, you got the best of my love(woah-oh)
Cause you got the best of my love, gave you the best of my love(woah-oh)
Cause you got the best of my love, you got the best of my love(woah-oh)
Cause you got the best of my love, gave you the best of my love
