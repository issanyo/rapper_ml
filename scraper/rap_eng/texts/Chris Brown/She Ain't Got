Now ain't nobody perfect but I've
(Given everything)
Even past the fact that you lied
(And what you did to me)
And lonely nights at home when I cried
Baby I cried, baby I tried, yeah
(And you don't)
Even care about what we had
(And I won't)
Deal with it, be your punching bag
(So don't)
Compare me to what I think is trash
So I'm a take out the trash
Soon as I find out who she is

Who is this chick that you think's all that
Tryna steal you away but I ain't havin' that
'Bout put my foot down on home girl's neck
To make her see that
She ain't got shit on me (that whore)
She ain't got shit on me (that whore)
She ain't got shit on me (that whore)
She ain't got shit on me (that whore)
She ain't got, she ain't got

Oh so you wanna leave
'Cuz you ain't gone'
You're a puppy on a leash
Time to come back home
I done let 'chu out to play
But 'chu ain't playin' fair
You done meet this little stray
Bringin' fleas 'round here
