[Intro]
I can't tell you no, no
'Cause you're irresistible, no

[Verse 1]
My heart, my mind
Is spinning at the same time
The thought of you is why
'Cause without you,, girl, the sun don't shine

[Pre-Chorus]
The places we go is straight out of a fairy tale
We're in love all over again

[Chorus]
So I can never say no
'Cause you changed my life
I'll never walk away
'Cause day by day
I need your love, your touch
Girl, I'm staying
'Cause I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I could never say no, no, no, no, no
I could never say no, no, no, no, no
I could never say no, no, no, no, no
I could never say no, no

[Verse 2]
You put a spell on me
Girl, without you it's hard to breathe
It's like you are my air
Made a man out of me
'Cause your love, it sets me free
And when I need you, you're there

[Pre-Chorus]
The places we go, are straight out of a fairy tale
Baby, we're in love all over again

[Chorus]
So I can never say no
'Cause you changed my life
I'll never walk away
'Cause day by day
I need your love, your touch
Girl, I'm staying
'Cause I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I could never say no, no, no, no, no
I could never say no, no, no, no, no
I could never say no, no, no, no, no
I could never say no, no

[Bridge]
All my ladies right now
I just wanna see you smile
Let it shine bright now
If you love me, baby, scream it out
Say oh, oh, oh
I can never say

[Chorus]
I can never say no
'Cause you changed my life
I'll never walk away
'Cause day by day
I need your love, your touch
Girl, I'm staying
'Cause I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you

[Outro]
I can't tell you no, no, I'm in love girl
I can't tell you no, no when it's raining or it's pouring outside
I'ma have you by my side
I can't tell you no, no, we can love forever
Always be together
I can't tell you no, no and make it last forever, make it last forever, oh
