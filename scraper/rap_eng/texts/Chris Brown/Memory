[Chorus: Asher Monroe]
For all of the moments, the good times, the love we share
Let's be more than a memory, memory, let's be more than a memory, memory
For all of the breakups, the makeups, for the lovers everywhere
Let's be more than a memory, memory, let's be more than a memory

[Pre-Chorus: Asher Monroe]
I wanna be there for ya, be there for ya
Be with you tonight, girl
Let me hold ya, hold ya, let me hold ya
We can share, this will not, the world's yours, I'm on your side

[Chorus: Asher Monroe]
For all of the moments, the good times, the love we share
Let's be more than a memory, memory, let's be more than a memory, memory
For all of the breakups, the makeups, for the lovers everywhere
Let's be more than a memory, memory, let's be more than a memory

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Everyone in the whole world, searching for someone to share
The love we have between our hearts and in my eyes, no one compares
Watch them stand by watching us, but we got our eyes closed
Seeing love through darkness, yeah, I want

[Pre-Chorus: Asher Monroe]
I wanna be there for ya, be there for ya
Be with you tonight, girl
Let me hold ya, hold ya, let me hold ya
We can share, this will not, the world's yours, I'm on your side

[Chorus: Asher Monroe]
For all of the moments, the good times, the love we share
Let's be more than a memory, memory, let's be more than a memory, memory
For all of the breakups, the makeups, for the lovers everywhere
Let's be more than a memory, memory, let's be more than a memory

[Bridge: Asher Monroe]
Come on, let's party, come on put my hands all on your body
We gotta tell nobody, oh oh oh oh right now
It's on, tell me when you go, it's a party, girl, gonna lose control
Got you high, don't need your clothes, I'm yours, girl

[Chorus: Asher Monroe]
For all of the moments, the good times, the love we share
Let's be more than a memory, memory, let's be more than a memory, memory
For all of the breakups, the makeups, for the lovers everywhere
Let's be more than a memory, memory, let's be more than a memory
