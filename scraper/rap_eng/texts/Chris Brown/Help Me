[Verse 1]
You look so good, I can't believe it
I'm out my mind, I shouldn't be but, oh
Women like you steal my control, scene of the crime, my spot is next door
Come on, girl don't be scared, now baby

[Chorus]
Help me, help me, help me
I want you to help me, help me, help me
I can't stop myself, you effing lovely
I wanna have you screaming, love you roughly
I need a little bit of help, keep raising the body count
When ever I take 'em out, I end up taking 'em down
Can you help me, help me, help me? Shoot me or something
Help me, help me, help me, do me or something, I need help

[Verse 2]
We're here, so alone, good, I got a problem
I'm out my mind over your body, I shouldn't be but, oh
Women like you steal my control, scene of the crime, my spot is next door
Come on, girl don't be scared, now baby

[Chorus]
Help me, help me, help me
I want you to help me, help me, help me
I can't stop myself, you effing lovely
I wanna have you screaming, love you roughly
I need a little bit of help, keep raising the body count
When ever I take 'em out, I end up taking 'em down
Can you help me, help me, help me? Shoot me or something
Help me, help me, help me, do me or something, I need help

[Bridge]
Won't you help me cause I can't leave it alone? I can't stop it
Cause every time I get it alone, I gotta pop it
It's like that I be feeling too grown, I'm feining
I be club hopping tryna get something popping and I
When I get her alone, already knowing I'm on it
I ain't tryna be good
So I'mma let you know, it's like woah
I need help tryna get this some control

[Chorus]
Help me, help me, help me
I want you to help me, help me, help me
I can't stop myself, you effing lovely
I wanna have you screaming, love you roughly
I need a little bit of help, keep raising the body count
When ever I take 'em out, I end up taking 'em down
Can you help me, help me, help me? Shoot me or something
Help me, help me, help me, do me or something, I need help
Help me, help me, help me
I want you to help me, help me, help me
I can't stop myself, you effing lovely
I wanna have you screaming, love you roughly
I need a little bit of help, keep raising the body count
When ever I take 'em out, I end up taking 'em down
Can you help me, help me, help me? Shoot me or something
Help me, help me, help me, do me or something, I need help
