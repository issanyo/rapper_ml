[Intro]
Oh yeah, I need you
It's Breezy and I ain't gotta have you no matter what
Can’t nobody hold me down, right now
Oh down down down down down, oh, woah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, used to hitting them parties
Pull up in the ‘raris (‘raris)
High as fuck and we ride, girl
So now we sayin’ our sorries, oh yeah
Yeah, you know the pain that I went through
And girl, you saw it for yourself (yourself)
You should feel sorry for yourself
And I, should go back around

[Chorus]
Can’t nobody hold me down (down, like you, can't no)
Can’t nobody hold me down, like you, like you, like you
Down, like you, can’t nobody hold me down (one sec, damn)

[Verse 2]
Make me feel like shit, like I’m nothin’ to you
Now I’m sitting in the Hills, got you missin' the view
I can read you like brail
Where's the real you?
Oh, I’m missing you, I’m missing you
If I was you, I see the truth
Say something, say something
You know that you want to, woah, say

[Chorus]
Can’t nobody hold me down (can’t nobody, like you)
Can’t nobody hold me down (can’t nobody), like you, like you, like you
Down, like you, can’t nobody hold me down
Yeah, can’t nobody hold me down (can’t nobody)
Can’t nobody hold me down (can’t nobody), like you, like you, like you
Down, like you, can’t nobody hold me down (yeah)

[Outro]
Oh, woah
Oh, woah
Oh
