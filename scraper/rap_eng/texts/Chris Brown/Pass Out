[Intro: Eva Simons]
Tu veux voler
Au bord du désir?
Je sais que tu me veux
Mais est-ce que tu mérites mon amour?

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Hot passing hour in the club, I was tryna cut a rug
I was sipping on, tryna find the missing link
You had a mission trying to vouge, then I came right through the smoke
I was smoking hot, catch my fever, let's burn up the floor
I need to know, how to get into you
Baby I'm liking your bod'
Ooh you got me stuck
I'm so effing into you, I let you blow my moves

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't breathe, I want to take your breath
Let your body feel it all night
I'm your battery here to charge you up
Let's start a riot on the floor
We'll wait 'til you pass out
We'll wait 'til you pass out
We'll wait 'til you pass out
We'll wait 'til you pass out

[Verse 2: Eva Simons]
I'm on and up and it's so hard to turn me down
Let's burn shit up cause I'm your fire starter now
I'll bring you back, can you smell that?
Now that I'm a rock star, I just wanna stop your heart
Go, go, enter on the dance floor
Go, go, am I what you asked for?
I'm a monster, not a pretty little girl
Eyes on me, so come follow me

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't breathe, I want to take your breath
Let your body feel it all night
I'm your battery here to charge you up
Let's start a riot on the floor
We'll wait 'til you pass out
We'll wait 'til you pass out
We'll wait 'til you pass out
We'll wait 'til you pass out

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Eva Simons]
I just can't say no, baby girl I wanna take you down
I'm not one of ya, silly boy I'm tryna turn you out
Girl give it up, know I really want ya
Blacking out, blacking out right now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't breathe, I want to take your breath
Let your body feel it all night
I'm your battery here to charge you up
Let's start a riot on the floor
We'll wait 'til you pass out
We'll wait 'til you pass out
We'll wait 'til you pass out
We'll wait 'til you pass out
