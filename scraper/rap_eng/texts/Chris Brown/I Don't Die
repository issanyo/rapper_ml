[Intro: Joyner Lucas]
Joyner, Joyner, Joyner, Joyner, Joyner
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Mind your motherfuckin' bid'ness, ain't nothin' you gotta see (buck, buck, buck)
How you all up in my shit when you got more problems than me?
Yeah, I'm cool but you don't wanna see that other side of me (yeah, yeah)
And my niggas mobbin' deep, hoe, I'm a fuckin' prodigy (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know, I know that you been envy, bitch, it ain't that hard to see
Don't you dare go fix your mouth to tell me that you proud of me
Ain't no choice to me but loyalty still means a lot to me
Some niggas'll gon' chop my arm right off and still reach out to me
I know you probably want that

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Joyner Lucas & Both]
You want that ambulance to pick me up and take me on that ride, yeah
Hoping that they don't revive a nigga and bring me back to life
And you shot me down, shot me down, shot me down, shot me down
Shot me down, that's all right (buck, buck) I don't die

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
B-b-bad to the bone
Everybody wanna be so motherfuckin' bad 'til they ass be alone
Now you back in the cold
And I'm laughin' at every single fag who didn't want me on half of they songs
It was that from the go
Just a bunch of little spoiled fuckin' bastards, every single one would laugh at my joke
Nigga, pass the Patrón
I think I'ma go and drink until I pass out and then fall in the back of the Rov' (raah)
Ménage on my mind (ayy)
I've been on my grind (woo)
Been through so much, sometimes think that God ain't on my side (yeah)
I cut all my friends off then say, "Y'all ain't on my vibe"
And it's so much more to life than drinkin', party all the time, woah (woo, woo, woo)
This gon' last a lifetime (lifetime)
No more Mister Nice Guy (Nice Guy)
I text Jaden Smith and told that nigga he a icon (icon)
Don't get shit fucked up just 'cause I ain't got no ice on
Don't mean I am not Sub-Zero, I should freeze you hoes at night time
I'm like, where the hell you been at?
I've been doin' this since I was a kid and my grandma used to ask me where my head at (buck, buck, buck)
Always in trouble, 'cause I was never learnin' nothin'
Except how to muscle my way into the game with no setbacks (brap, brap)
And all that been sleepin' on me, fuck it, where the bed at?
'Cause I've been strugglin', tryna be on top but them other niggas
Blind for me, but fuck it, it really doesn't mean nothin'
If their music ain't really cuttin' it they get hit with the galick gun (buck, buck, buck)
One day y'all gon see me (see me)
I make shy look freaky (freaky)
I make dry look greasy (woo)
I make hard look easy (easy)
I remember way back when my momma took my TV, hoe
Now I'm all on TV, hoe (woo)

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Mind yo motherfuckin' bid'ness, ain't nothin' you gotta see (buck, buck, buck)
How you all up in my shit when you got more problems than me? (Buck, buck, buck)
Yeah, I'm cool but you don't wanna see that other side of me (yeah)
I don't want to hear no sorrys, bitch, fuck your apology
I know, I know that you been envy, damn, it ain't that hard to see
I don't wanna get to know you, no please, don't say hi to me
Ain't no choice to me but loyalty still means a lot to me (buck, buck)
Some niggas'll gon' chop my arm right off and still reach out to me
I know you probably want that

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Joyner Lucas & Both]
You want that ambulance to pick me up and take me on that ride, yeah
Hoping that they don't revive a nigga and bring me back to life
And you shot me down, shot me down, shot me down, shot me down
Shot me down, that's all right (buck, buck) I don't die

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
That's why a nigga ride with a weapon
Better that than me lyin' on a stretcher
Gunshot (pow, pow, pow!)
Applyin' all the pressure
Potato on the chopper
Shootin' through the pillow, blood on the feathers (buck, buck, buck)
Rollin' dice with ya life, all I do is roll 7s (woo)
Eagle on my lap when I walk with the devil
Hit a bitch from the back like I don't know better
Man, I swear to God you better talk to the reverend (buck, buck, buck)
Yeah, I'm on a weed high, dehydrated
Her booty fuckin' skin-tight, Levi made it (yeah, yeah)
Yee-haw, yee-haw, put her in a stable
Keep my cards in my pocket, never put 'em on the table (woo)
Leave her bra on the floor, put my dick up on her naval
Do what I say, don't give me no ultimatum
Ride around or die, get your life taken
Shit, already went half on a baby (buck, buck, buck, buck)
All these broke bitch ass niggas
Tryna tell a real nigga how to really fuckin' get a bag (woo)
How you fuckin' 25 with your first car?
I got 10, that's why them niggas mad (hey)
Why you wanna hate on progress? (Woo)
Why you wanna keep me in the projects? (Jheeze)
Nigga, why you wanna eat off my check? (Hey)
That's some weird ass shit, you suspect (hey)
That's a weird ass bitch, don't trust that (woo)
Shut the hell up, a nigga ain't done yet (hey)
All these shots, are you niggas havin' fun yet? (Buck, buck)
I'ma do it by the book so run that (hey)
Take ya bitch, then I ride in the sunset (hey)
Layin' on the Westside, hit Sunset (hey)
Backwoods, you can find me where the skunk at (hey)
Bullet with ya name on it, if you want that (buck, buck)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Joyner Lucas & Both]
You want that ambulance to pick me up and take me on that ride, yeah
Hoping that they don't revive a nigga and bring me back to life
And you shot me down, shot me down, shot me down, shot me down
Shot me down, that's all right (buck, buck) I don't die
