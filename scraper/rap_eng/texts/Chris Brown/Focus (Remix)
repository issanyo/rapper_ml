[Chorus: H.E.R & Chris Brown]
Me—Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Please—

[Verse 1: H.E.R]
Hands in the soap
Have the faucet's running
And I keep looking at you
Stuck on your phone
And you're stuck in your zone
You don't have a clue

[Pre-Chorus: H.E.R]
But I don't wanna give up
Baby, I just want you to get up
Lately, I've been a little fed up
Wish you would just focus on

[Chorus: H.E.R & Chris Brown]
Me—Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Me—Me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
What is this a joke?
You know I get this money
So I guess you can't complain (mm)
You don't have to be alone
If you bring your ass home
You been running through my mind all day
I can't fuck it up
Baby, I just want you to let up (ohh)
Maybe I been a little selfish, I should do better (yeah)
Wish you would just focus on

[Chorus: H.E.R & Chris Brown]
Me—Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Baby—Me
Can you focus on me?

[Outro: H.E.R]
Baby, focus
Can't you see?
I just wanna love you, baby
Look me in my eyes
