[Intro]
What kind of a show you guys putting on here today?
When the only class in this act is sitting next to me
And I'm here to tell ya, this boy's soul is in tact
It's non negotiable, you know how I know?
Someone here, and I'm not gonna say who, offered to buy it
Only Charlie here wasn't selling
Sir you're out of order, how 'bout I show you out of order?
Stand down Mr Slade, I'm not finished
I don't know if Charlie's silence here today is right or wrong
I'm not a judge or jury but I can tell you this
He won't sell anybody out to buy his future
And that my friends is called integrity, that's called courage
Now that's the stuff leaders should be made of
Now here's Charlie, he's come to the crossroads
He has chosen a path, it's the right path
It's a path made of principle and leads to character, let him continue on his journey

[DJ Drama]
You know I knew we was gon' be here
I mean, why you think I wanted to call it In My Zone in the first place?
DJ Drama, lot of times you see a lot of things take people out their rhythm
The money, the girls, and the fame all won't get into the fame
But thankfully, Chris Brown is in his zone
And I'm in my zone too, Babey Drew with me
Now let's get you in your zone
Shoutout to Raphael our jewellers, aw man In My Zone, Breezy

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Hey tell the DJ Gucci mane said to play reggae
Reggae bitch not Ray J, damn I like his sister Brandi
The Cali sips brandy to do this to Miami
The phantom in my mattress and my white beater can't stand it
Gucci, the only thing I'm lacking is a chick to stand beside me
To drive my baby coupe the days I don't feel like driving
I take you to a island that I been dying to get you smiling
With a change of clothes change hit your friends up reclining
Down south swagger with these oversees diamonds
Oversize, customise haters get blinded
Put your glasses on girl cause I'm so shinny
And the way you looking at me girl, you looking at mine

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She says she wanna go around the world
She says she wanna be my baby girl
She says she wanna see what it feels like
To be Ms. Breezy

And I'mma let her see what it feels like
To be Ms. Breezy

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Oh, she love me cause I'm so good to her
Yeah she love me, spend it all up on her

She can get anything that she wants
I know she only used to have it regular
Coming in and outta lala on the regular
She ain't never had the type of shit I'm giving her
Shoes are first, Louis purse, hair down never splurge

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
And now I'm blowing her mind, her mind
Cause everyday she roll out in a phantom
I know she wanna be mine, aw yeah

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I know she ain't used to girls staring at her
Pointing at her man cause I'm tricking on her yeah
And I heard it ain't tricking if you got it
And I got a lot of it so I blow it on her yeah

And I'm gon' still buy gifts 'til she won't turn none of them down
But she don't want nothing from me
And she gon' change her last name, she can't wait to be Mrs. Brown

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
