[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Kid Red)]
Yeah, baby, I'm a fool with it
All this money, what you gon' do with it?
I got a lawyer for the case
Girl, just let me know if you with it
I don't really plan for tomorrow
I just do whatever I want
And damn right, I'ma act a fool with it (I'm a fool, nigga)
Damn right, I'ma act a fool with it (ha)

[Verse 1: Kid Red]
I'm 'bout to act a fool with all these bitches (kid Red)
I'm rolling backwoods up, I swear it's my religion (yeah)
And you can kick it, baby, under one condition
That you twerk it for a nigga like a video audition (ah)
I just wanna see you put it in reverse (in reverse)
Back it up and dump it in a pile like some dirt (like some dirt)
Big booty, lil' booty go to work (go to work)
Big booty, lil' booty go to work (ha)
She just tryna pay her bills and get a purse (yeah)
Waitin' on a check, said it's comin' on the first (hey)
Nigga might help her, I'm a victim of the thirst (hey)
Told Brown get a friend, after that we disperse (right now)
Let me get some toppy with the top off (hey)
In that 'rari, all red like hot sauce (skrrt)
Stones ruby red, lookin' like grapefruit (huh)
Diamonds on me lookin' clearer than some Grey Goose (Kid Red)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Kid Red)]
Yeah, baby, I'm a fool with it  (I'm a fool)
All this money, what you gon' do with it? (Gon' do)
I got a lawyer for the case (let's go)
Girl, just let me know if you with it (ha)
I don't really plan for tomorrow
I just do whatever I want (Kid Red)
And damn right, I'ma act a fool with it
Damn right, I'ma act a fool with it

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Look, okay, I'm 'bout to act a fool with all my niggas
I'm 'bout to make that pussy drunk, so bring the liquor
Pussy too cold give a nigga shivers
Like a UPS package, know a nigga gon' deliver
All this liquor got me fuckin' up my liver
Give you dick, take it back, Indian giver
Fuck a camera, better get the big picture
If ya dead broke, bitch, I won't even deal with ya, ha
This the anthem for the whoadies and my niggas
Wrappin' trap money, made that quarter off of chickens
Jive ass turkeys won't make it to Thanksgiving
Make that hundred million then I take that shit back to Virginia, ha
Monkey business, man, that shit just so bananas
Lamborghini white and black, call that shit a panda
Car game, excuse me, where my fuckin' manners?
My dick'll have her smilin' like a fuckin' jack-o-lantern
Bitches say they need that white girl or that Hannah Montana
I keep shittin' on these niggas like I poo-pooed in a Pamper, ha
Oh shit, I'm dodgin' police and the cameras
Watch me Instagram that bitch, I bet that hoe a dancer
Big booty with a super flat stomach
I tried to fuck that bitch but she start askin' for the money
She says that sheâ€™s been fuckin' with me since I made "Run It!"
Who the hell you think I am, a motherfuckin' dummy?

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Kid Red)]
Yeah, baby, I'm a fool with it
All this money, what you gon' do with it?
I got a lawyer for the case
Girl, just let me know if you with it
I don't really plan for tomorrow
I just do whatever I want
And damn right, I'ma act a fool with it (I'm a fool, nigga)
Damn right, I'ma act a fool with it (ha)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Okay, I'm the shit, nigga, fuck a nomination
Give yo' bitch the dick, I don't need no conversation
Watch me whip it, watch me whip it like a fuckin' dominatrix
Best not waste my time, hoe, I'm all out of patience
I got money 'bout yay high, ballin' like I'm AI
Roll another swisher, bitch, you know a nigga stay high
Eat that pussy up, beat it up, are you fuckin' kidding?
Put that dick up in your life, I'm fuckin' up your kidneys
I'm spendin' that paper, she gettin' that money, she ready to go
Fuckin' with all of them models, I'm poppin' that bottle, she swallow, I'm checkin' her throat
I want a freak, she went to me, stalkin' her Instagram, likin' her posts
She in the pink, I'm in the mink, I pull it out, watch her take off her clothes
I'm 'bout to make a song for all the strippers
Already bought artillery for all my niggas
And for you lyin' hoes, quit the Robin Givens
Call it murder when I tour, I make a motherfuckin' killin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah, baby, I'm a fool with it
All this money, what you gon' do with it?
I got a lawyer for the case
Girl, just let me know if you with it
I don't really plan for tomorrow
I just do whatever I want
And damn right, I'ma act a fool with it
Damn right, I'ma act a fool with it
