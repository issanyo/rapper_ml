[Verse 1]
I got my keyboard, symbols all ready
Pull up the strings and leave the bottom all heavy
Palms all sweaty, this feels like a dream
Little excited, you know what I mean, girl
Girl, I'm in need for a woman that can play
Knows how to turn it up loud any time of the day
Take my CD and baby, press repeat
It ain't no need to speak, just let it play

[Pre-Chorus]
Well you got my attention now
I can't let you down, your lyrics and your sound
Imagine me and you, what we gon' do
Just listen but wait before the break down

[Chorus]
Let's listen to some love music, love music
Lay back and just let it spin, this music is your friend
Love music, love music
Nobody has to know
Let's listen to some love music, love music
Can't wait to get this party started
I'll hit the switches, let me remix it
Sit back and listen to some love music

[Verse 2]
Turn my mic up, can you loop it now?
From the rhythm of the track and it ain't gon' change, the tempo stays the same
Let it flow through the music now
And I just want to see you smile
Now forget about what it is, yeah
So baby, take my CD and baby, press repeat
It ain't no need to speak, just let it play

[Pre-Chorus]
Well you got my attention now
I can't let you down, your lyrics and your sound
Imagine me and you, what we gon' do
Just listen but wait before the break down

[Chorus]
Let's listen to some love music, love music
Lay back and just let it spin, this music is your friend
Love music, love music
Nobody has to know
Let's listen to some love music, love music
Can't wait to get this party started
I'll hit the switches, let me remix it
Sit back and listen to some love music

[Bridge]
No matter what the record is
Anytime it plays, girl, my heart skips a beat
I feel it in my soul, I'm about to over load
It's taking control of me
We're the perfect harmony, baby
Let's just keep the speakers blasting
And I won't stop
'Til we burn out together

[Chorus]
Let's listen to some love music, love music
Lay back and just let it spin, this music is your friend
Love music, love music
Nobody has to know
Let's listen to some love music, love music
Can't wait to get this party started
I'll hit the switches, let me remix it
Sit back and listen to some love music

[Outro]
Love love music
Love love love music, love music love music
Love love music
Love love love love music, love music love music
