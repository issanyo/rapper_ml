[Verse 1]
I know exactly what you like and baby I'm about to take it down
You say you want me, is that right? I think it's best we get up out here now
Because I saw you in that dress, they can't handle this, speeding while I'm tryna steal
You kissing on my neck, I'm feeling on your leg, that yellow light ain't stopping now

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I ain't gotta waste a night with you babe
We doing 95 in a 35, baby you know what to do

[Chorus]
We gon' run some red lights
And you know there ain't no stopping even when we get home
Girl we gon' run some red lights
Push the pedal to the metal screaming "Fuck the Five-O"
And girl you know it's key push to start, sex in a car for hours
Your body parts under your hood, it's power babe
And I ain't even tryna gas you up
And we gon' run some red lights

[Verse 2]
Yeah backseat goes right and whip, hold on it's gon' take long, endure this trip
Girl you got the new car, the new car smell and we gon' give this new car a new car smell
Yeah revving my engine you turning me on, yeah shifting your gears I love how you moan, love how you moan, love how you moan
It was so good that I had to go back for a second so I could just relive the moment

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't gotta waste a night with you babe
We doing 95 in a 35, baby you know what to do, baby we gon'

[Chorus]
We gon' run some red lights
And you know there ain't no stopping even when we get home
Girl we gon' run some red lights
Push the pedal to the metal screaming "Fuck the Five-O"
And girl you know it's key push to start, sex in a car for hours
Your body parts under your hood, it's power babe
And I ain't even tryna gas you up
And we gon' run some red lights

[Bridge]
Red lights, all night baby, yeah
And we gon' take a midnight sex drive, don't think you heard what I said, fuck every red lights
Red lights, all night, baby, fuck every red lights
Midnight sex drive, don't think you heard what I said, fuck every red lights

[Chorus]
We gon' run some red lights
And you know there ain't no stopping even when we get home
Girl we gon' run some red lights
Push the pedal to the metal screaming "Fuck the Five-O"
And girl you know it's key push to start, sex in a car for hours
Your body parks under your hood, it's power babe
And I ain't even tryna gas you up
And we gon' run some red lights

[Outro]
Red lights, all night baby
And we gon' take a midnight sex drive
Don't think you heard what I said, fuck every red lights
Red lights, all night baby, midnight sex drive
