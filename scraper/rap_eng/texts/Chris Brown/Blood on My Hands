[Verse 1]
In this lonely world, in this cold cold world
Where champions were made to fight
And lonely hearts were made just to love you
And thieves were meant to steal all of the above

[Chorus]
I got blood on my hands, blood on my hands, blood on my hands
I got blood on my hands, blood on my hands, blood on my hands

[Pre-Chorus]
I was naked in the waves, you were laughing in the distance
I was screaming out to you, but you never seem to listen
We both set out to sea, we were rocking in the waves
And you prayed my boat would sink, and you lead me to the grave

[Chorus]
And now there's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands
There's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands, yeah

[Verse 2]
We're falling, almost feels like we're flying
Let the stars guide you to love, but thieves were meant to steal all of the above

[Chorus]
I got blood on my hands, blood on my hands, blood on my hands
I got blood on my hands, blood on my hands, blood on my hands

[Pre-Chorus]
I was naked in the waves, you were laughing in the distance
I was screaming out to you, but you never seem to listen
We both set out to sea, we were rocking in the waves
And you prayed my boat would sink,and you lead me to the grave

[Chorus]
Now there's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands
There's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands
Now there's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands
There's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands

[Pre-Chorus]
I was naked in the waves, you were laughing in the distance
I was screaming out to you, but you never seem to listen
We both set out to sea, we were rocking in the waves
And you prayed my boat would sink, and you lead me to the grave
I was naked in the waves, you were laughing in the distance
I was screaming out to you, but you never seem to listen
We both set out to sea, we were rocking in the waves
And you prayed my boat would sink, and you lead me to the grave

[Chorus]
Now there's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands
There's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands
Now there's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands
There's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands
