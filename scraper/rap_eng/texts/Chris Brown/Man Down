[Intro]
Everything foreign, nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All I hear is gunshots (bang, bang)
Up and down my block (yeah, ow!)
It don't never stop (ow!)
Either you in or out
I see the paramedics, news cameras, police choppers
Man down, but they don't know who shot 'em
It's lookin' like The Walking Dead, zombies
Everyday a nigga D.I.E
If anybody scared, fuck from 'round me
If you ain't with the bid'ness, get the fuck from 'round me

[Verse 1: YBN Nahmir]
Slide down on my niggas on tip (raah!)
30 shots they gon' go through your whip (hits)
I'm the man, smokin' nigga like a zip
Then turn around and I fuck on his bitch (bop, bop, bop, bop)
I gotta keep movin', keep one in the Ruger (ayy)
Bullets hot, they gon' hit your medula (yeah)
I'm chasin' the sack, gotta get to the safe
By any means, gotta get that moolah (bop, bop, bop, bop)
It's gun shots erywhere so, boy, you better hide (you finna hide)
If Breezy say it's fuck you, so you know I'm finna slide (watch me slide)
Watch me do that walk up, you seen that pole, now he surprise
Hollow tips gon' hit 'em then I'm hoppin' in that ride (bop, bop, bop, bop)
Say the people took my brother, so I'm screamin', "Fuck the feds"
I rather keep that blower 'fore my mama see me dead
If a nigga run up on me, I'ma fill 'em up with lead (raah!)
.223's hit his body, pop a nigga like some mints
If I ever hit a lick then you know I'm breakin' bread (I'm breakin' bread)
Niggas snitchin' to the cops, they be talkin' to the feds

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All I hear is gunshots (bang, bang)
Up and down my block (yeah, ow!)
It don't never stop (ow!)
Either you in or out (I see)
I see the paramedics, news cameras, police choppers
Man down, but they don't know who shot 'em
It's lookin' like The Walking Dead, zombies (bang, bang)
Everyday a nigga D.I.E (woah, ooh)
If anybody scared, get the fuck from 'round me (bang, bang)
If you ain't with the bid'ness, get the fuck from 'round me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You better find that exit (exit)
Stop that flexin' (stop)
Before I send you to the Reverend
All my niggas reckless, you get the message
None of y'all ain't gon' shoot (pow)
Niggas lame, tryna complain
Bitches still snitchin' if you tell the truth (oh woah-oh-oh)
You ain't 'bout shit, now leave (shit, now leave)
And now I got a dick on me (dirty clip)
I made this bitch feel my piece (yeah, yeah)
And she ain't never felt one of these
Yeah, tell her bend over
Then I shot man down, it's over
Then a man hit coke just like soda
Man tellin' lie, lemme kill all the rumors
Mash up the pussy, gah run, run to her
Whine up for me, you gotta come sooner
Nigga headless, knock out the tumor
Give 'em good dick now all I hear is

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All I hear is gunshots (bang, bang)
Up and down my block (yeah, ow!)
It don't never stop (ow!)
Either you in or out (I see)
I see the paramedics, news cameras, police choppers
Man down, but they don't know who shot 'em
It's lookin' like The Walking Dead, zombies (bang, bang)
Everyday a nigga D.I.E (woah, ooh)
If anybody scared, get the fuck from 'round me
If you ain't with the bid'ness, get the fuck from 'round me
