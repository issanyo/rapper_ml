[Chorus]
'Bout to bring the heat, give me my boombox
Bring it, bring it back to the time
When people rocked mics and the b-boys shined
I got that perfect beat, give me my—
Fat gold chains, Adidas with no strings
Gazelles with my gutter shades
If you love it, love it
Tell the DJ turn it up, I want it, want it
Just, give me my boombox

[Verse 1]
Remember them days when you had to be home before
The street lights came on?
You barely made it, ooh yeah
I came in a little late, the movie's watch breaking
Thinking I was Turbo tryna do the moon walk from a
Damn wall
Man, I was crazy, crazy
That's what made me who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
It was the mind that made us heavy
It was the grind that kept it steady
But now things have changed, not the same
I'ma have to bring it back, we 'bout

[Chorus]
'Bout to bring the heat, give me my boombox
Bring it, bring it back to the time
When people rocked mics and the b-boys shined
I got that perfect beat, give me my—
Fat gold chains, Adidas with no strings
Gazelles with my gutter shades
If you love it, love it
Tell the DJ turn it up, I want it, want it
Just, give me my boombox
Boombox

[Verse 2]
I thought I was so fly rocking my Kangol hat to the side
Thought I was a b-boy (B-boy), yeah, yeah
I was in love with the Beemer, with the gold kid on the right
Nice in the rear view, huh, it was

[Pre-Chorus]
It was the mind that made us heavy (Heavy)
It was the grind that kept it steady (Steady)
But now things have changed, I had to upgrade
I'm about to bring it back

[Chorus]
'Bout to bring the heat (Oh, oh, hey!), give me my boombox
Bring it, bring it back to the time (Yeah)
When people rocked mics and the b-boys shined (Uh-huh)
I got that perfect beat, give me my— (Yeah)
Fat gold chains, Adidas with no strings (Uh)
Gazelles with my gutter shades
If you love it, love it
Tell the DJ turn it up, I want it, want it
Gimme, gimme, gimme my boombox

[Bridge]
This is a public service announcement
Everybody who did it, haha, can I holla at you?
I just wanna say thank you for the opportunity of letting me learn this
I'm here, we bringing it back

[Chorus]
'Bout to bring the heat, give me my boombox
Bring it, bring it back to the time
When people rocked mics and the b-boys shined
I got that perfect beat, give me my—
Fat gold chains, Adidas with no strings
Gazelles with my gutter shades
If you love it, love it
Tell the DJ turn it up, I want it, want it
Just, give me my boombox
