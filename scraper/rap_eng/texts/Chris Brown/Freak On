[Intro: Teyana Taylor]
Oh, oh, oh
(Mustard on the beat hoe)

[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
You off, you on
The pieces could hit, boy, the pieces could work tonight
So just slide 'em to the side, let's go
Lick my spot so I can (uh) oh I, let's get down to the point tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Oh, we can be backseat in your Jeep parked in the cut
Oh, we can do it on the hood, on the roof, just tear me up

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & (Chris Brown)]
Oh, 'cause I'ma be your freak all through the day, until the dawn
And I can do whatever thing you like, boy what you want (bop, bop)
'Cause we ain't gotta tell nobody (oh, yeah)
We ain't gotta tell nobody (body)
'Cause it goes on and on and on
On and on and on, yeah

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I'm up and you up

You got me feigning, wanting more, beat it up, you on all fours
Don't know why, I be so ready all the time

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh, we can role play, spread your legs, I eat it up (girl, I)
Girl, I'ma make love to your mind when I beat it up (girl, I need you)

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & (Chris Brown)]
'Oh, 'cause I'ma be your freak all through the day, until the dawn (I need you)
And I can do whatever thing you like, boy what you want, yeah, yeah (bop, bop, oh yeah)
'Cause we ain't gotta tell nobody (nobody)
We ain't gotta tell nobody, and we ain't gotta tell nobody
'Cause it goes on and on and on, on and on and on, yeah (on, yeah, yeah, ah!)

This is the way we sway, so baby, come get it
I want a freak in the morning, freak in the evening
This is the way we sway, so baby, come get it
