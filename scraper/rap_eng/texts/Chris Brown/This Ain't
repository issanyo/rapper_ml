[Verse 1]
Girl, it just don't feel the same, wish I could go back in time
Seems like every time I say your name, I just wanna press rewind
You said you just want me back, but I don't think that you ready yet
And I know that you want me to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
You said if I love you I would, I would, I would, I would
If we look at how we live, it's no good
Babe, it's no good, no good, no good, no good
And you know, you know I'm right

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just fucking, baby
This ain't loving, baby
We're just fucking, baby
But this ain't loving, baby
No, you want it
I ain't your man, girl, I'm only your friend

[Verse 2]
Wish that I could read your mind 'cause I don't know if you telling the truth
You can tell me every lie, tell me how do I believe you?
'Cause once we get to kissing, you gon' have me finished, and I'll feel something's missing
I say I'm cool fucking 'round with you

[Pre-Chorus]
You said if I loved you I would, I would come back to you
If we look at how we live, it's no good
Babe, it's no good, no good, no good, no good
Girl, you know, you know I'm right

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just fucking, baby
This ain't loving, baby
We're just fucking, baby
But this ain't loving, baby
No, you want it
I ain't your man, girl, I'm only your friend
