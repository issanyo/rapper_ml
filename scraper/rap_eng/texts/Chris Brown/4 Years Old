[Verse 1]
I got money, everything that I ever wanted
Never thought of what I might need, need, need
Ain't it funny, how I spend my whole life running
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing?

[Chorus]
It feels like I'm 4 years old all over again
'Cause I'm just running fast and should be walking
Saying when I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy

[Verse 2]
I guess I was faking 'cause look at all the money I'm making
Still nothing can compare to the thought of love
But it's taking too much time to see that I'm wasting
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing

[Chorus]
It feels like I'm 4 years old all over again
'Cause I'm just running fast and should be walking
Saying when I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy

[Bridge]
I'm so alone, I feel so alone, so alone in this world
Got everything I want

[Chorus]
It feels like I'm 4 years old all over again
'Cause I'm just running fast and should be walking
Saying when I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy
