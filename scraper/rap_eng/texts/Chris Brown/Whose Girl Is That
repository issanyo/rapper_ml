[Verse 1]
When I first saw you
I said to myself, girl, who you looking good for?
Who you talking to?
Who that fella is standing right next to you?
Look at me, silly me
Got me thinking 'bout changing the game
And I can't let you get away
So I said hello, hello, girl, what's your name?

[Chorus]
Whose girl is that? Whose girl is that?
You're supposed to be the one, I'm needing that
I wonder who she talking to on the phone
I know it's not me, so I'm gonna get on
Stop playing, mama, come over here
You need to go ahead and throw that number
This love is crazy, let's work something out
I wanna work something out, let's work something out, baby

[Verse 2]
The time is right now
You ain't gotta look at me with a frown
Or sucking you lips
All you gotta do is say no or yeah, yo
And we can go, all the way to the top
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Can't let you get away
So I said hello, hello, girl, what's your name?

[Bridge]
Something 'bout ya, baby girl, I love ya sexy ways, oh
The way you give me chills when I see your face

[Chorus]
Whose girl is that? Whose girl is that?
You're supposed to be the one, I'm needing that
I wonder who she talking to on the phone
I know it's not me, so I'm gonna get on
Stop playing, mama, come over here
You need to go ahead and throw that number
This love is crazy, let's work something out
I wanna work something out, let's work something out, baby

[Interlude]
Lady and gentleman, the mack of the year

[Chorus]
Whose girl is that? Whose girl is that?
You're supposed to be the one, I'm needing that
I wonder who she talking to on the phone
I know it's not me, so I'm gonna get on
Stop playing, mama, come over here
You need to go ahead and throw that number
This love is crazy, let's work something out
I wanna work something out, let's work something out, baby

[Bridge]
Something 'bout ya, baby girl, I love ya sexy ways, oh
The way you give me chills when I see your face
Something 'bout ya, baby girl, I love ya sexy ways, oh
The way you give me chills when I see your face

[Chorus]
Whose girl is that? Whose girl is that?
You're supposed to be the one, I'm needing that
I wonder who she talking to on the phone
I know it's not me, so I'm gonna get on
Stop playing, mama, come over here
You need to go ahead and throw that number
This love is crazy, let's work something out
I wanna work something out, let's work something out, baby
