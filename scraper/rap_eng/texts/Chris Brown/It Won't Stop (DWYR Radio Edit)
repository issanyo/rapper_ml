[Intro: Sevyn Streeter]
Oh-oh-oh oh, oh, oh-oh-oh oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh oh, oh, oh-oh-oh oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh oh, oh, oh-oh-oh oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh oh, oh, oh-oh-oh oh, oh

[Verse 1: Sevyn Streeter]
I love when you pulling up in your Jeep, bumping all your beats
J's on with your shades on, just to bring me something to eat
You the man up in these streets, but when it comes to my heart
That don't mean a thing, no, oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
Baby hop in my ride, ooh, it's hot as hell outside
Got the top down with your doors closed
With my hand up on your thigh
Drive slow, ooh, take your time

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
And it won't stop, boom, boom
And it won't stop, boom, boom
And it won't stop, boom, boom
And it won't stop, boom, boom
Rocking your body
And it won't stop, boom, boom
Rocking your body
And it won't stop, boom, boom
Said I'm rocking your body
And it won't stop, boom, boom
Rocking your body to sleep

[Verse 3: Seyvn Streeter]
I love when we pulling up to that beach , sand down in my feet
Sun down, nobody round, that's one hell of a scene
You rocking my body, rock rock the boat, Aaliyah
Don't it sound familiar?

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
And you sound like, uh uh, ayy, ayy
Looking up into space
It's just me and my bae
And we feel so amazing, oh, oh, oh, all night, woah

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
And it won't stop, boom, boom
And it won't stop, boom, boom
And it won't stop, boom, boom
And it won't stop, boom, boom
And it won't stop, boom, boom
And it won't stop, boom, boom
Said I'm rocking your body
And it won't stop, boom, boom
Rocking your body to sleep
And it won't stop, boom, boom
And it won't stop, boom, boom
And it won't stop, boom, boom
Said I'm rocking your body
And it won't stop, boom, boom
Rocking your body to sleep

[Outro: Sevyn Streeter]
Oh-oh-oh oh, oh, oh-oh-oh oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh oh, oh, oh-oh-oh oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh oh, oh, oh-oh-oh oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh oh, oh, oh-oh-oh oh, oh
And it won't stop
