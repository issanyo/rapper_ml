[Intro]
Damn, ha, leggo

[Verse 1]
The wheels on the Bugatti go 'round, 'round, 'round
Tappahannock in V.A., yep, that's my town, town, town

[Pre-Chorus]
Ay girl, tell me what you talk
Pretty motherfucker, I'mma put you on the wall now
Ay girl, you could get it all
Cause I know you like the way my beat go, beat go, beat go, beat go

Pretty as a, pretty as a picture on the wall now
Ay girl, you could get it all
Cause I know you like the way my beat go

[Chorus]
Bassline, girls like my bassline
Girls like my bassline, bassline
Shake it to my bassline, gonna make it to my bassline
Get butt naked to my bassline, bassline

Girl, you know you like my bassline, bassline
It's gonna shake it to my bassline, gonna shake it to my bassline
Get butt naked to my bassline, bassline

[Verse 2]
I'm winning, you heard about my image
But I could give a flying motherfuck who's offended
Said baby, if I go any harder
I'mma get you out your guarder, but you're somebody's daughter
Girl, I just gotta know you wanna get it the way that I do
And if you with it, just bring your friends cause they loving the crew
I like your piercings, your attitude, girl and all your tattoos
So come get it with it, leave with me and take this key to my room, I told her

[Pre-Chorus]
Ay girl, tell me what you talk
Pretty motherfucker, I'mma put you on the wall now

[Verse 3]
Ha look, yeah, I'm getting money, I'mma name my price
Thousand bottles on these models, nigga, this ain't your night
Frank Muller got a nigga chilling, how that bitch feel with ice?
My bassline to her waistline, a nigga 'bout to bust them pipes
I'm wilding, money piling, two dime twins when their thighs bend
And the way I'm kicking will make Bruce Lee want to throw the towel in
Man, life is just so glorious, you could never worry us
You niggas just be playing then gravy in notorious
I said them girls in the front, bet that Breezy make 'em jump
Over here we got that loud, over there they got this bump
Boy, we do this every night, you got to save up for a month
And you just say I'm blowing smoke, but nigga, I'm just being blunt

[Chorus]
Bassline, girls like my bassline
Girls like my bassline, bassline
Shake it to my bassline, gonna make it to my bassline
Get butt naked to my bassline, bassline
Said them girls like bassline, girls like my bassline
Girl, you know you like my bassline, bassline
It's gonna shake it to my bassline, gonna shake it to my bassline
Get butt naked to my bassline, bassline
