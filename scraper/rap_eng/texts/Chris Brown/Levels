[Verse 1]
Got my call OK
I decline that bitch all day
No I can't lie it’s a side bitch
No I can't, I can't, no
I don’t usually ask for forgiveness
Bringing up my past oh, bitch you tripping
I see you fishing
You treat me different
It's plain and simple
In your fucking feelings
First I get my shit and leave
´Cause it's over now
What more do you want from me?
No you done brought this shit up
Here sit down
You can't blame me for it (nobody)
Say you love me (nobody)
Baby Ima work this out
And I don’t need to hear shit from nobody

[Chorus]
I ain't crazy
This ain't all in my head
I seen this with my own two eyes
If I might hurt
Strike me dead
So damn tired
I know what you're thinking
I keep getting you fucking over
Way past a conversation
All I can say is fuck you, fuck you, fuck

[Verse 2]
See now bitch you being disrespectful
Ain't no nigga even tryna stress you
You been hoeing round everywhere
Even though we fuck it don’t mean you special (no)
Girl when I leave I got my feet on the pedal
Ain't no looking in my rear view mirror
I know she loving all the bezels and the medals
But I would never settle cos there's levels to these levels
Keep the diamonds, keep them rocks and the petals
Bitch I used to let it shine out of element
Ain’t it funny how the pot call the kettle black
I'm so done playing with your silly ass
I know I gotta move forward
