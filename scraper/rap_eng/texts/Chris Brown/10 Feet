[Intro]
Ain't no way we could ignore this fire
When I’m this close to you
Ain't no way, we could push up to the side
No, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve been missing you, you
And all the sexy things we do , do
Even when you say, you’re through, through
Deep inside, I know you’re listening to, woah
You’ve been talking, you don’t mean that
Where your head at? Where your head at?
I’ve been calling, tryna get up
Where your head at? Where your head at?

[Chorus]
Take me away, but I can't reach you
Reach you, even though we’re in the same room
10 feet away, and still I can’t reach you
Reach you, even though we’re in the same room

[Verse 2]
I gotta re-up sometimes
I wanna re-up sometimes, yeah
Just give me a reason why
Just give me a reason why
You want me to stay
‘Cause if I go on this roller coaster
I want no games
You know I’m gonna ride for you
That will never change

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve been missing you, you
And all the sexy things we do, do
Even when you say, you’re through, through
Deep inside, I know you’re listening to, woah
You’ve been talking, you don’t mean that
Where your head at? Where your head at?
I’ve been calling, tryna get up
Where your head at? Where your head at?

[Chorus]
Take me away, but I can't reach you (oh yeah)
Reach you, even though we’re in the same room (yeah)
10 feet away, and still I can’t reach you
Reach you, even though we’re in the same room, oh yeah
