[Verse 1]
I smile through the night
No matter what the people like
Cause my mind doesn't mind
Just dancing in the city lights

[Pre-Chorus]
No I don't mind being special
Isn't that what we all want?
Here's to all my lonely dancers
Go ahead and make it all yours

[Chorus]
My lonely dancers, all my lonely dancers
My lonely dancers, this your song
Just keep on dancing, oh just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long
My lonely dancers, all my lonely dancers
My lonely dancers, this your song
Just keep on dancing, oh just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long

[Verse 2]
Tonight, feel alright
Still dancing in the city lights
Tonight's just about
Why shouldn't I just cross the line

[Pre-Chorus]
No I don't mind being special
Isn't that what we all want?
Here's to all my lonely dancers
Just know that you're not alone

[Chorus]
My lonely dancers, all my lonely dancers
My lonely dancers, this your song
Just keep on dancing, oh just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long
My lonely dancers, all my lonely dancers
My lonely dancers, this your song
Just keep on dancing, oh just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long

My lonely dancers, all my lonely dancers
My lonely dancers, this your song
Just keep on dancing, oh just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long
My lonely dancers, all my lonely dancers
My lonely dancers, this your song
Just keep on dancing, oh just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long

[Outro]
Just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long, for long
Just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long, for long
