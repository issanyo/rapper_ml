[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Now what you ladies tryna get in?
Extra large Magnum's the only one I'm fitting
Open up your mouth baby I can be your dentist
Before I go too far let's go back to the beginning
Mine paid for, your nigga shit be rented
Suicide doors and she dying to get in
They looking at me stank cause they know I be shitting
They try to keep me out cause they know I take they women

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ayy, meet me outside ask your girl what she think about ménage, models all day
Me plus you then we add another girl up in the room
Bring it back, bring it back  and sit that big ol' booty all up on my lap
Matter fact, here go a stack, private party and I don't know how to act

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty so, call the girls cause I'm a looking for a bad chick
Put your hands in the air if you a bad chick
Ain't gotta ask for it, she gon' let have it when she let me have it, I'ma let her have it
I'ma let you have it, girl, I'ma let you have it, girl, I'ma let you have it, I'ma let you have it, daddy, can you have it?

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, I pull up black man, black Porsche rag
Really wanna make him mad hop yo ass in
Oh this your first time ride let me hit the gas
Don't you play with me later or this will be your last
I'm a rude, rude nigga let me have it
You got that big booty poking out, now let me grab it
I'm something like a king, fuck you on the mattress
Rat-a-tat my name on that ass then I smack it like

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ayy, meet me outside ask your girl what she think about ménage, models all day
Me plus you then we add another girl up in the room
Bring it back, bring it back  and sit that big ol' booty all up on my lap
Matter fact, here go a stack, private party and I don't know how to act

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty so, call the girls cause I'm a looking for a bad chick
Put your hands in the air if you a bad chick
Ain't gotta ask for it, she gon' let have it when she let me have it, I'ma let her have it
I'ma let you have it, girl, I'ma let you have it, girl, I'ma let you have it, I'ma let you have it, daddy, can you have it?

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
Now let me find out you'll let me blow your spine out
Sex game mean, make you call a time out
Quarter 'til we can rendezvous back at my house
That pussy crack got me fiending like Amy Winehouse
If I give you 9, can I get that other 60?
When it come to licky licky, we can split it 50/50
Peanut butter skully have you cuming in a jiffy
Damn skippy swallow my juniors, Ken Griffey

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ayy, meet me outside ask your girl what she think about ménage, models all day
Me plus you then we add another girl up in the room
Bring it back, bring it back  and sit that big ol' booty all up on my lap
Matter fact, here go a stack, private party and I don't know how to act

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty so, call the girls cause I'm a looking for a bad chick
Put your hands in the air if you a bad chick
Ain't gotta ask for it, she gon' let have it when she let me have it, I'ma let her have it
I'ma let you have it, girl, I'ma let you have it, girl, I'ma let you have it, I'ma let you have it, daddy, can you have it?
