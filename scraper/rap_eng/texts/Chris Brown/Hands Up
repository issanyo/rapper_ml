[Verse 1]
Pull up with no warning
Sex early in the morning
Girl, I came to give you something
And I know you're gonna love it, huh
Hold up a lighter, don't put out my fire
Unless she lettin' me drown in the water
She the only one that make me feel like this
That girl I love her

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh yeah, every time I'm with you, oh
Come and let me kiss you, oh
Baby, what's the issue?
Say, "Fuck it," I'm with you, baby

[Chorus]
You right, girl, do what the fuck you like, girl
Get crazy, I'ma let it ride, ride, ride
She don't care, I'll be living for the night
Hands up high
You right, girl, do what the fuck you like, girl
Get crazy, I'ma let it ride, ride, ride
She don't care, I'll be living for the night
Hands up high

[Post-Chorus]
I'm driving, I'ma follow your directions
Just sit back and ride, ride, ride
Oh, ride, ride, ride
Ride

[Verse 2]
Pull up with no warning
Sex early in the morning
Girl, I came to give you something
And I know you're gonna love it

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh yeah, every time I'm with you, oh (with you)
Come and let me kiss you, oh (kiss you)
Baby, what's the issue?

[Chorus]
You right, girl, do what the fuck you like, girl

She don't care, I'll be living for the night (oh)
Hands up high
You right, girl, do what the fuck you like, girl

[Bridge]
You right, girl (hands up high)
