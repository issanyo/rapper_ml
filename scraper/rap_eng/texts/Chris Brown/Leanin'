[Intro: Project Pat & (Juicy J)]
Sippin' on some sizzurp
Sippin' on some sizzurp (mmm)
Sip-sippin' on some, sip-sippin' on some sizzurp (yeah)
Pour it on up, it's goin' down (yeah)
Sippin' on some sizzurp, sip-sippin' on some sizzurp (yeah, Breezy)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Juicy J)]
I put that syrup in my double cup
Chop and screwed, body on the way (yeah)
Leanin', leanin' (leanin')
Leanin', leanin', oh, oh
And baby, when you look into my eyes
You know why they open wide (damn)
Leanin', leanin'
Leanin', leanin'
All of these feelings, yeah, you catchin' feelings, yeah
And seein' all the signs
Leanin', leanin'
Girl, you leanin', leanin'
You pop this pill then tell me what you feelin'
And take it for this ride
Leanin', leanin' (yeah)
Leanin', leanin', woo
(Sizzurp)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Got that soda bowl, then we glow, white girls put coke up their nose
Shakin' ass for Juicy J, I'm throwin' money 'til they close
Seen 'em all, seen me ball, pour it all, drank it all
Got that blower in the car, just in case it go that far
Roll up, pour up, what's the hold up? Hold up
I be slowed up, dozed off, off that slow stuff, woke up
I give no fucks, slow bucks, better than no bucks, so what?
That bitch chose up, feed her, need no coca, so up
I be rackin' up the M's, fuckin' hoes on film
Blowin' strong like the weed in the gym
Still sippin' that sizzurp
I been ballin' like arenas (Blizzards)
And then two freaky foreign bitches
She ain't bad, told her don't bring her with them
I let her spend the night if my girl with it
We can have a threesome with them

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I put that syrup in my double cup
Chop and screwed, body on the way
Leanin', leanin'
Leanin', leanin', oh, oh
And baby, when you look into my eyes
You know why they open wide
Leanin', leanin'
Leanin', leanin'
All of these feelings, yeah, you catchin' feelings, yeah
And seein' all the signs
Leanin', leanin'
Girl, you leanin', leanin'
You pop this pill then tell me what you feelin'
And take it for this ride
Leanin', leanin'
Leanin', leanin', woo
(Sizzurp)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
(Quavo)
Drank, drank, drank on me (drank on me)
Yeah, they call me young Quavo (Quavo)
Dropped the top, told your bitch, "Get in"
She gon' do what I say so (skrrt, skrrt)
She gon' do what I say so (skrrt, skrrt)
I told her count up the pesos (count it up)
Yeah, came from puttin' bricks in the cars like Maaco (bricks)
I don't get tired when I'm whippin' pies
Hit 'em with that circumcised, choppers in my archive
Came from servin' the fiends on 'em (yeah)
Now I'm in the coupe with the wings on it (yeah)
Now I'm just lookin' for somebody to lean
Lean, lean, lean, lean on me
I advise you to pay up (cash)
Cut 'em off on the way up (cut 'em off)
I'm on the boards like a layup
On your hoe face more than makeup (bluh)
Bet I beat you to the paper (I bet it)
Cup filled with the Lakers (I bet it)
Blunt filled with the Lakers (yeah)
Bow, bow, I demolish a hater

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I put that syrup in my double cup
Chop and screwed, body on the way
Leanin', leanin'
Leanin', leanin', oh, oh
And baby, when you look into my eyes
You know why they open wide
Leanin', leanin'
Leanin', leanin', oh, oh
All of these feelings, yeah, you catchin' feelings, yeah
And seein' all the signs
Leanin', leanin'
Girl, you leanin', leanin'
You pop this pill then tell me what you feelin'
And take it for this ride
Leanin', leanin'
Leanin', leanin', woo
