Licking your lips, do it like that, baby

And shawty turn me into a believer

[Verse 2]
Yeah, let me step up to the plate now
Big kids in the room, no playground
I wanna kiss everythin' from the waist down
Keep ya ass up and your face down
Oh girl, lovin' the way you do it
Freakin' me to the music, keep a hat on like I'm Jewish

Ah uh what you take me for a groupie?
Naw, just wanna get you to my sex room
And do my shit and I don't mean restroom

Sayin' all type of shit like wow down

[Chorus]
Shawty, I'ma only tell you this once, girl, I need it tonight
And when I do it to you, I'ma do you right, please believe it
All night long, baby, right now
When you lay in my arms,oh, oh
'Cause it ain't nothing like
Your love, girl, I want your love
Your love, girl, I need your love
It ain't nothing like your love, your love

When you give me a kiss, I give it right, back
Licking your lips, do it like that, baby
