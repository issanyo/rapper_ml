[Chorus]
You know I need it, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're my medicine, medicine, oh, woah, oh
You know I need it, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're my medicine, medicine
And I be on them flights
Higher than the kites
Baby, you're a superstar
Burning up the lights
You know this the life
Yeah, this is life
Had to say it twice
You know I need it, need it
You're my medicine

[Verse]
Wake your fuckin' hands when we dance on the party boat
You're my medicine, medicine, my medicinal
Jumpin' off the boat to my other submarine
Goin' down, goin' down, let 'em light up the torpedo
'Cause you got it, I want it, I need it, that's all
A little somethin' for fun, no need to overdose
Now we bumpin', we rockin', we all on the floor
Girl, you're my medicine
Rollin' with my niggas, rollin' into town
You rollin' with your bitches, guess you gon' bring the loud
You know this my city, and you know I run it
My name on everything, isn't it ironic?
Oh, oh, oh
Girl, just let me know, oh, oh, oh, oh
You can pick the place so we can meet up
Drinkin' by the liter
So what we gon' do?
I'll play follow the leader

[Chorus]
You know I need it, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're my medicine, medicine, oh, woah, oh
You know I need it, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're my medicine, medicine
And I be on them flights
Higher than the kites
Baby, you're a superstar
Burning up the lights
You know this the life
Yeah, this is life
Had to say it twice
You know I need it, need it
You're my medicine

[Verse]
Wake your fuckin' hands when we dance on the party boat
You're my medicine, medicine, my medicinal
Jumpin' off the boat to my other submarine
Goin' down, goin' down, let 'em light up the torpedo
'Cause you got it, I want it, I need it, that's all
A little somethin' for fun, no need to overdose
Now we bumpin', we rockin', we all on the floor
Girl, you're my medicine, medicine, medicine

[Chorus]
You know I need it, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're my medicine, medicine, oh, woah, oh
You know I need it, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're my medicine, medicine
And I be on them flights
Higher than the kites
Baby, you're a superstar
Burning up the lights
You know this the life
Yeah, this is life
Had to say it twice
You know I need it, need it
You're my medicine

[Outro]
You know I need it, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I need it, need it, need it
You know I need it, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I need it, need it, need it
