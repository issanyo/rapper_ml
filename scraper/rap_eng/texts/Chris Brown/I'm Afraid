[Verse 1]
It's kinda crazy I feel this way, baby, I'm saying
What kinda man have I come to know to be out there playing?
But babe, I got a lot to say, why won't you listen
'Cause I been a fool, going crazy without you with me
It's kinda crazy I feel this way, baby, I'm saying
What kinda man have I come to know to be out there playing?
But babe, I got a lot to say, why won't you listen
'Cause I been a fool, going crazy without you with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, oh why, oh why, oh why, I been stupid lately
Girl, I apologize, I owe you, baby
Please don't bury me alive 'cause it's killing me inside
And I can't lie girl, I

[Chorus]
I'm afraid that you're cheating, must have been my love me
Been neglecting your trust as if it was enough, I messed up
I'm afraid that you're giving up, I did too much, my love
Right now it's all about us, all about all, about us, my love

[Verse 2]
It's kinda crazy about my babe, she was never complaining
She was never fed up with me but I kept on changing
One time had the nerve to say that she was laming
She couldn't compare them other girl wouldn't care to deal with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, oh why, oh why, oh why, I been stupid lately
Girl, I apologize, I owe you, baby
Please don't bury me alive 'cause it's killing me inside
And I can't lie girl, I

[Chorus]
I'm afraid that you're cheating, must have been my love me
Been neglecting your trust as if it was enough, I messed up
I'm afraid that you're giving up, I did too much, my love
Right now it's all about us, all about all, about us, my love
