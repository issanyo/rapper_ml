[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pleasure P]
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love
You chose me, you chose me
And I chose ya and I chose ya
You chose me, you chose me
And I chose ya, yeah, yeah
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I'm single and horny, won't you get up on me?
C'mon baby, give it to me, girl
You should get to know me, but first you gotta show me
How you gonna rock my world
And how you gon' ride for me, you got your eyes on me
I'ma pull your cart, after this I win your heart
Baby, you gotta be, the baddest thing in this club
But first you gotta know

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pleasure P]
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love
You chose me, you chose me
And I chose ya and I chose ya
You chose me, you chose me
And I chose ya, yeah, yeah
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love

[Verse 2: Yung Joc]
I'm such a leader, not a follower, I'm known to do my own thing
Fall off in the spot, Dirty D with the home ting
Rip the grip, don't say the wrong thing
MJs swag too criminal, with the chrome thing
I'm on that grown man, I'm never outta place
Ask about my swag, oh yeah, it's outer space
Y'all go buy the bar, Joc buy the whole place
You buy it buy the bottle, I'll pop the whole case
Posted on the sofa, blowin' fat spilfs
Linix small tags, I shop at Saks Fifth
Hard 'em up K, Christian Artikay
Your bitch keep watchin' me she thinkin' what she ought to say
I'll leave her speechless, had your girl shell shocked
I can tell she freaky and just don't know how to tell Joc
I got it leakin', Vicky Secrets on flash flood
I just need some good lovin', I ain't lookin' for love

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pleasure P]
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love
You chose me, you chose me
And I chose ya and I chose ya
You chose me, you chose me
And I chose ya, yeah, yeah
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love
