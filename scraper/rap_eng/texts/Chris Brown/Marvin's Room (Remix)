[Intro: Chris Brown]
This right here's for the niggas that been hated on
This shit right here
This shit right here
This right here

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
He's saying he's your best friend
And he's always the one in your ear
I know that he been waiting
To get my ass up out of here
It's been a couple months now
Baby I am not surprised
But I'm a real nigga
Girl, how you gonna take his side?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I bet if I lick that spot then you won't act like that
I miss giving you them backshots, girl, you remember that?
Baby and I'd be damned if I let him take my place
Don't listen to what that nigga say
Cause he's just saying you could do better
And baby all I'm saying is he sound like a hater
And baby he could just fuck off and do us a favor
Mind your business, nigga stop being a hater

[Bridge: Sevyn Streeter & Dawn Richard]
Woah
Here we go, why these niggas keep hating for Woah
Guess that's just the way it goes Woah
Uh oh, that's the way it goes Woah
Uh oh, that's the way it goes Woah

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Baby what the hell are you thinking?
By the way you screaming at me
Thinking youâ€™ve been drinking
I know that nigga's on your line
But he can't get what's mine, yeah
Baby you need to show me what the hell I did wrong
I need you to hold me, right here in your arms
And I'm kissing your heart and all your little body parts
Baby, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I bet if I lick that spot then you won't act like that
I miss giving you them backshots, girl, you remember that?
Baby and I'd be damned if I let him take my place
Don't listen to what that nigga say
'Cause he's just saying you could do better
And baby all I'm saying is he sound like a hater
And baby he could just fuck off and do us a favor
Mind your business, nigga stop being a hater

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
See it's a reason why she still with me
And she ain't with you
She see the real in me, and the bitch in you
Yeah, she friends with you, but she sexting me
When she textin' you, she be next to me
Showin' me how weak you is, it's embarrassing
I'm a real nigga so I guess you are a mannequin
Bad on the phone but in person you be panickin'
I ain't even stressed, got a bag full of cannabis
I ain't with the bull so this ain't beef
You a weenie I bet you be lying on your meat
If real recognize real, who the fuck is you?
She need a principal, not a substitute

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
He's just saying you could do better
Girl stop playing he could never
Be the one you need 'cause you're the one for me girl
I know how to please you right
He's just saying you could do better
Girl stop playing he could never
Be the one you need 'cause you're the one for me, yeah
But I'm a real nigga
