[Verse 1: Ester Dean]
This is for boss bitches, for money makin' bitches
All my ladies, throw your hands in the air
I got Patron in my cup and I don't give a fuck
The baddest bitch in the club right here (here I go)
Oh, they wanna see me drop it, drop it, drop it
Wanna pop it, pop it, pop it, shake that ass on the floor
You wanna see me shake it, shake it, shake it
Yeah, you like it, like it, like it when I drop it real low

[Pre-Chorus: Ester Dean]
Oh, yeah boy, you like that
Oh, I can tell that you like that
Oh, yeah boy, you love it when my booty goes
Boom, ba-ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom, boom

[Chorus: Ester Dean & Chris Brown]
Drop it, drop it low, girl, drop it, drop it low, girl
Oh, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop it, drop it low, girl, drop it, drop it low, girl
Drop it, drop it low, girl, drop it, drop it low, girl
Oh, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop it, drop it low, girl, drop it, drop it low, girl
He told me move that thang around and move that thang around
And move that thang around and move that thang around
He said move that thang around and move that thang around
And move that thang around and move that thang around

Come and ride in my Bugatti, girl, come drop it low

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ester Dean]
Oh, yeah, girl, I like that (oh, yeah)
