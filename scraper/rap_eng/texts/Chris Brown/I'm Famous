[Intro: Chris Brown]
Bang, bang. Look, man, why's it every time we try to get into the club, the bouncer acts like he don't know who you are? Shut up, man. It's crazy innit? You know what I think? Do you know who I am? Or do I have to say it 3 more times?

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you

[Verse 1: Don P]
I'm fuckin' famous, Lil Wayne, John Wayne
Gucci, then I get that green
VIP, everythin' on me
Aw, they be like everythin' on him, hehe
Champagne's in the bottles with the models
Got 'em ballin' in the club like they won the lotto
Don P, know what I mean
That's right, it's all on me

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Strobe light in the club like a movie, slow mo
When we leave the party, pile 'em in the 4 door
I got a turbulance, she shout out my nigga Loso
I'm buyin' 100 bottles, that's if you want more
So wave your hands up in the air
If you're shinin' like a chandelier
The only thing I see is money up in here
I'ma get this girl a bottle, she gon' make it disappear
Champagne's in the bottles with the models
And I got 'em all screamin' like they won the lotto
If you don't want this P, tell 'em try Moscato
'Cause my doors goin' up on my Murcielago

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Let the stars shine bright tonight
'Cause everybody's famous tonight
Let the stars shine bright tonight
'Cause everybody's famous
Let the stars shine bright tonight
'Cause everybody's famous tonight
Let the stars shine bright tonight
'Cause everybody's famous
Let the stars shine bright tonight
'Cause everybody's famous tonight
Let the stars shine bright tonight
'Cause everybody's famous
