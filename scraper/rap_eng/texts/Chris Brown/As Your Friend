[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I just can’t live anymore like this
My heart just opened up the door again
Just watch me fly as I spread my wings
Don’t ask me why 'cause there are too many things

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And now we’re standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Oh lil mama, I can feel your fire
You're poisonous, lady, let me take you higher
And I don’t care if it’s a bad time
Just label me the bad guy tonight

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And now we’re standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I came to party hoping that you would fall in love
Don’t mean to put no pressure on you
Everybody loves a molly and the DJ, he’s getting drunk
Trying to get next to you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Now we’re standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend
I woke up, I woke up as a friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend

[Bridge: Afrojack]
I'ma fuck that pussy
I'ma fuck that pussy
I'ma fuck that pussy

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Now we’re standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend
I woke up, I woke up as a friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend

[Bridge: Afrojack]
I'ma fuck that pussy
I'ma fuck that pussy
I'ma fuck that pussy
