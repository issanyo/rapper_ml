[Intro]
Marlon Brando-do-do-do
Marlon Brando-do-do-do

[Verse 1]
Champion for love, champion for love - for you
I stand, as tall as a mountain top
With my heart on my sleeve
And my head in a dream
I murder for your heart, a stranger in the dark - for you
I fall, just like an avalanche
With my heart on my sleeve
And my head in a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
I would run a hundred miles, a hundred miles
With my love in the ocean
And my head in the clouds
I would swim a thousand laps, a thousand laps
With my love in the ocean
And my head in the clouds, yeah

[Chorus]
I will be your samurai, Marlon Brando
I will slay the vampire - for you
I will be your epiphany
Be your hero
I will slay the vampire - for you

[Verse 2]
A prisoner for love, a prisoner for love - for you
I stand, as tall as an empire
With my heart on my sleeve
And my head in a dream
A-a-a victim of your art, a victim from the start - for you
I fall, just like an avalanche
With my heart on my sleeve
And my head in a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
I would run a hundred miles, a hundred miles
With my love in the ocean
And my head in the clouds
I would swim a thousand laps, a thousand laps
Girl, I could be your knight in shining armor
Riding on my chariot, Marlon Brando

[Chorus]
I will be your samurai, Marlon Brando
I will slay the vampire - for you
I will be your epiphany
Be your hero
I will slay the vampire - for you

[Sample - Marlon Brando & Chris Brown]
Horror! Horror has a face and you must make a friend of horror. (For you, Marlon Brando)
Horror and moral terror are your friends. (It’s for you, babe, Marlon Brando)
If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. (For you, Marlon Brando)

[Bridge]
For you, for you, yeah
I will be your samurai, oh babe
And I will slay the vampire - for you
For you, for you, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I will be your samurai, Marlon Brando (I will be)
I will slay the vampire - for you (for you baby)
I will be your epiphany (yeah, I wanna be your)
Be your hero
I will slay the vampire - for you (with you yeah)

[Outro]
For you, oh-oh babe (baby)
For you, for you and for you (for you, for you, for you)
It's for you babe, for you (for you, for you, it’s for you)
You, it's for you (for you, it’s for you baby)
