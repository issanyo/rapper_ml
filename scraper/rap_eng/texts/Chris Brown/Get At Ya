[Intro]
This is the final piece of the puzzle

[Verse 1]
Where you going? Slow it
Don't act like you don't see me, I'm glowing
Show me what you look like in the morning, tone it on it
Floating on 25s, I wouldn't be fly if I threw some D's on it

[Pre-Chorus]
From the centre to the floor I'm fresh low key
When I step through the door all eyes on me
Wanna be a star, get on TV
It's 'bout to jump off in my car so come with me, oh baby

[Chorus]
Hey girl I love what you do
The way ya making it move, I'm tryna give it to you
Said girl I'm tryna get at ya, tryna, tryna get at ya
You see me sitting on chrome and I'm tryna get at ya
Hey, I want ya girl, you, you feel me girl
Move, oh you, I'm on ya, said girl I'm tryna get at ya
Tryna, tryna get at ya hey hey hey hey
You see me sitting on chrome and I'm tryna get at ya

[Verse 2]
Girl I'm slowly approaching
Dodging those misdemeanors, they on it, want it
I know they waiting on me to run it, run it
You gotta show me, if you with it, be a bad girl

[Pre-Chorus]
From the centre to the floor I'm fresh low key
When I step through the door all eyes on me
Wanna be a star, get on TV
It's 'bout to jump off in my car so come with me, hey girl

[Chorus]
Hey girl I love what you do
The way ya making it move, I'm tryna give it to you
Said girl I'm tryna get at ya, tryna, tryna get at ya
You see me sitting on chrome and I'm tryna get at ya
Hey, I want ya girl, you, you feel me girl
Move, oh you, I'm on ya, said girl I'm tryna get at ya
Tryna, tryna get at ya hey hey hey hey
You see me sitting on chrome and I'm tryna get at ya

[Verse 3]
700 horsepower, speakers beating down the block
Girls stop, automatic static, better call the cops
Bad chick, looking like she finna let me grab it
I'mma have to snatch it but I'm tryna get at ya
200 miles per hour, speakers beating down the block
Girls stop, automatic static, better call the cops
Bad chick, looking like she finna let me grab it
I'mma have to snatch it but I'm tryna get at ya

[Chorus]
Hey girl I love what you do
The way ya making it move, I'm tryna give it to you
Said girl I'm tryna get at ya, tryna, tryna get at ya
You see me sitting on chrome and I'm tryna get at ya
Hey, I want ya girl, you, you feel me girl
Move, oh you, I'm on ya, said girl I'm tryna get at ya
Tryna, tryna get at ya hey hey hey hey
You see me sitting on chrome and I'm tryna get at ya

[Outro]
Tryna give it to you, do you feel me girl?
Tryna give it to you, do you feel me girl?
Tryna give it to you, do you feel me girl?
Do you feel me girl? Do you feel me girl?
Tryna give it to you, do you feel me girl?
Tryna give it to you, do you feel me girl?
Tryna give it to you, do you feel me girl?
Do you feel me girl? Do you feel me girl?
