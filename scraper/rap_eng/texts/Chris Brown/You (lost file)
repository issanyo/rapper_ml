[Verse 1:]
Hey mama have you seen a chick
Whos body's 'bout as good as it gets
Oh yeah this cutie was thick
I ain't never seen a girl like this
With so much class and so much hips
Got me feeling right
And I ain't worried about the things she do
Cuz she the type that don't need a crew
And I can tell it by the way she smiles
Swaggers bad, can't be mad
Let's get ghost tonight

[Chorus:]
(She got) the craziest body
(And shes a) exotic little mami
(She got) curves in the back
Sexy eyes to match
What's messing with that?
Her smile lights up the room
And she ain't got no attitude
I wouldn't say if it wasn't true
I'm talking about you

[Verse 2:]
So baby now you know the deal
Don't be fronting tell a nigga what's real
Come on baby tell me how you feel
Cause the temperature's rising
Getting excited
Oh mama I'm getting ready to jump up on it
Don't get it twisted cause babygirl you know I want it
And I know you really wanna be my woman
Girl, I'm talking about you

[Chorus x2:]
The craziest body
(And shes a) exotic little mami
(She got) curves in the back
Sexy eyes to match
What's messing with that?
Her smile lights up the room
And she ain't got no attitude
I wouldn't say if it wasn't true
I'm talking about you

[Outro:]
You you you you you
You you you you you
You you you you you
You you...
I'm talking about you
You you you you you
You you you you you
You you you you you
You you...

[Chorus: x2]
The craziest body
Exotic little mami
Curves in the back
Sexy eyes to match
What's messing with that?
Her smile lights up the room
And she ain't got no attitude
I wouldn't say if it wasn't true
I'm talking about you
