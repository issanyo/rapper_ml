[Verse 1]
Don't let that pretty face fool ya
See that girl she's hot like fire
Don't judge a book just off the cover
That girl right there she'll blow your mind, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Behind closed doors yeah, she's something like an animal
Behind closed doors yeah, you know that girl is a professional

[Chorus]
When the lights on, she be acting shy
But in the darkness, she comes alive
She's a F.A.N
But that's alright, she's a freak at night
But that's what I like, look in her eyes
It's no surprise she's a freak at night
She's a freak at night
She's a freak at night

[Verse 2 ]
She's such an innocent killer
She don't even mean no harm, oh no
Feels like I'm on the set of Thriller
When the evening starts to fall, woah yeah

[Pre-Chorus]]
Behind closed doors yeah, she's something like an animal
Behind closed doors yeah, you know that girl a professional

[Chorus]
So when the lights on, she be acting shy
But in the darkness, she comes alive
She's a F.A.N
But that's alright, she she's a freak at night
But that's what I like, look in her eyes
It's no surprise she's a freak at night
She's a freak at night
She's a freak at night

[Verse 3]
Ha, look, leggo, okay freak at night, that's what I like
Vampire to the pussy I'mma take a bite
Never drive for the dick she gon' take a flight
A trip to Paris overnight
Banging to the beat with our clothes off
Taking shot after shot 'til we doze off
And I smoke about pound of that loud shit
And she fucking with the white, blow her nose off
Yeah you a FAN, why not?
Bet you never seen a cool nigga this hot
I spend a 100 grand nigga look at this watch
And her panties on the fan cause I'm hitting that spot
Okay when I pull up, I pull out and put it in
And she gon' run that shit when I get it in
Two doors, got two floors in my Benz
I fuck FANs, I fuck FANs

[Chorus]
When the lights on, she be acting shy
But in the darkness, she comes alive
She's a F.A.N
But that's alright, she she's a freak at night
But that's what I like, look in her eyes
It's no surprise she's a freak at night
She's a freak at night
