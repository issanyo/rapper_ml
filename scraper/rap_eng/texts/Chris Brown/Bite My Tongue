[Verse 1]
It's getting hard to bite my tongue
Making me feel so dumb
Can't explain it, feel so numb
So let me think about it, um, 'bout it, 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, I'm thinking how to say
Ooh, ooh, a million different ways
Ooh, ooh, I'm thinking how to say
Let's get up out this place, yeah

[Chorus]
I promise I won't bite my tongue
Oh woah, ha
I promise I won't bite my tongue, hey, hey
Oh woah, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Girl, I'm not tryna kiss and run
I shoot it off like a gun
Bang, bang, I would kill for you, I live for the thrill of you, mmm
And I'ma not tryna do you wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, I'm thinking how to say (ooh, ooh, to say, say, oh na na na na)
Ooh, ooh, a million different ways (ways)
Ooh, ooh, I'm thinking how to say (say, yeah)
Let's get up out this place, yeah

[Chorus]
We can take it London to LA, hey, hey
I promise I won't bite my tongue, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh woah, hey, hey, oh woah, hey, hey, hey
Oh woah, oh woah

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Girl, I would kill for you, I live for the thrill of you, mmm
And I'ma not tryna do you wrong

[Chorus]
Baby, I promise not to bite my tongue
Ooh, woah, woah, oh na na na, yeah
Bite my tongue, on you, baby
And I'm not tryna do you wrong
