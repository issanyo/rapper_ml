[Intro: Solo Lucci & Chris Brown]
Wrist, trill, wrist, trill
Wrist, trill, wrist, drippin' and drippin'
Wrist, skrr, skrr, tip, four, tip, wrist
Drippin', drippin', drippin', drippin', drippin', drippin', drippin, drippin'

[Verse 1: Solo Lucci]
My wrist 'bout 30 below, why would I be worried 'bout hoes?
And if you ain't ever leanin', swervin' in traffic, you ain't sip that dirty before
Catch me tippin' on 4's, diamond drippin', prolly sippin' on 4's
Ferragamo slippers dipped 'em in gold with so many women, think I'm pimpin' on hoes

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Cause my wrist still drippin', 44's still tip
In the cut with my hittas, no they do not miss
I'm a champagne pourin' nigga, I love big asses and tits (Show me them tities)
And if you're here just to witness, I just promise this

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Hold my wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, drip, 44's tip
Hold my wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, drip, 44's tip

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
No he not ballin' like us, who the fuck he think he is?
You gotta come to my city, you gotta see how we live (Pull up with the drug dealers)
You should just come on the bed, I should just fuck you right now
Oh just forget what I said, I just be thinkin' out loud
Thinkin' out loud, thinki'g out loud
Can I hit in the mirror? Yeah, I wanna see your body clearer
Let's think out loud, think out loud
Got my wrist doin' 85 in a 35, 35, 35

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, drip, 44's tip
Hold my wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, drip, 44's tip

[Verse 4: Solo Lucci]
My wrist 30 below, it cost 'bout 40
It's 50 on me, my neck is retarded
But nigga I'm geeked, my bitch is a baller
But she from the streets so don't get her started
Handcuffs like I got arrested homie
Ferragamo's on me, got me flexin' on 'em
Mud, mud, I got all these taxes on me
Diamonds shinin', that's them VVS's on me
Leanin' off Activis, tippin' on fours
Thinkin' 'bout when them hoes used to sleep on me like mattresses
But that's how it go, now I'm gettin' that dough
And I'm 'bout to count up like it's calculus
(Actually) I got my name off that trappin' shit
But I got the fame off this rappin' shit
Now my watch and my chain is immaculate

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Bitch go ahead look at my wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, drip, 44's tip
Hold my wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, drip, 44's tip
Wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, drip, 44's tip
Hold my wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, drip, 44's tip
