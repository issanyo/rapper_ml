[Verse 1]
Why am I mad? I don't get it
It seems like every time you give me signs and I miss it
I did it again, I admit it
I left you standing there and now I regret it

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems like every time I get the chance
I lose my cool and I blow it
And I get all tongue tied, lost in your eyes
I'm a fool and I know it

[Chorus]
I should've kissed you, I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And next time I won't stop, I'll listen to my heart
Cause what I feel is real
I should've kissed you
I should've told you how I feel
I should've kissed you
I should've showed you just how I feel

[Verse 2]
Now why didn't I give you my two cents?
A million reasons why I should have and it makes no sense
So here I am, by myself again
Stopping for green lights and I know I wanna be more than friends

[Pre-Chorus]
How come every time I get the chance
I lose my cool and I blow it
And I get all tongue tied, lost in your eyes
I'm a fool and I know it, hey

[Chorus]
I should've kissed you, I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And next time I won't stop, I'll listen to my heart
Cause what I feel is real
I should've kissed you
I should've told you how I feel
I should've kissed you
I should've showed you just how I feel

[Bridge]
So I turned the car around and you were right where I left you
And your smile said you were feeling it too
And the moon shone bright cause when your lips met mine
And yeah I finally got it right, I'll be leaving with you tonight and I won't have to say

[Chorus]
I should've kissed you, I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And next time I won't stop, I'll listen to my heart
Cause what I feel is real
I should've kissed you
I should've told you how I feel
I should've kissed you
I should've showed you just how I feel

[Outro]
Girl I should've kissed you
I should've told you told you just how I feel
And this time I won't stop until I have your heart
Cause what I'm feeling is real
