[Intro: Aaliyah & Chris Brown]
I don't think they know the truth, A-A to the L-I-Y-A-H, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
It's Breezy
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Don't let 'em tell you any different
Yeah-yeah, yeah, they don't know about us, they don't know about it
I owe it all to you
Yeah-yeah, yeah, they don't know about us, they don't know about it
And as much as I messed up, always give me your best love
Yeah-yeah, yeah, they don't know about us, they don't know about it
Sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve you
Yeah-yeah, yeah, they don't know about us, they don't know about it

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
They gon' talk about it, gon' talk about it, gon' try to change your mind about it
Gon' tell you things you don't wanna hear but we good, don't worry 'bout it
So when they talk about, they talk about it, just let 'em know we already got it
Just tell 'em that we gon' work at it, we good, don't worry 'bout it

[Chorus: Aaliyah & Chris Brown]
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
Don't listen to, how could they know?
What people say, how could they know?
They don't know about, how could they know?
'Bout you and me, how could they know?

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
At my best you love me
Yeah-yeah, yeah, they don't know about us, they don't know about it
Even or at my worst
Yeah-yeah, yeah, they don't know about us, they don't know about it
And I know that it's different, feels like we're best friends, we connected
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
What did I do to deserve you?
Yeah-yeah, yeah, they don't know about us, they don't know about it

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
They gon' talk about it, gon' talk about it, gon' try to change your mind about it
Gon' tell you things you don't wanna hear but we good, don't worry 'bout it
So when they talk about, they talk about it, just let 'em know we already got it
Just tell 'em that we gon' work at it, we good, don't worry 'bout it

[Chorus: Aaliyah & Chris Brown]
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
Don't listen to, how could they know?
What people say, how could they know?
They don't know about, how could they know?
'Bout you and me, how could they know?

[Bridge: Aaliyah & Chris Brown]
How could they know? How could they know?
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
How could they know? How could they know?
They don't know about us, they don't know about it

[Verse 3: Aaliyah]
I thank you for the autographs and the cheers over the years
You stood by me, you didn't doubt me, I think you want some more
I do more than sing, I model now
Acting now, plus I got my own movie now
After all the awards that they gave me, you stood by me
You didn't play me, you didn't doubt me, I think you want some more
I truly believe that if it wasn't all for you
I don't know what I would do

[Chorus: Aaliyah & Chris Brown]
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
Don't listen to, how could they know?
What people say, how could they know?
They don't know about, how could they know?
'Bout you and me, how could they know?
