[Intro]
Yeah, young, young, young Chris
Yo, yo, drop the beat about right about
Yeah, right there, right there
Uh huh, oh, yeah, come on, check it

[Verse 1]
Why you calling me a player?
Why you call me little shorty-mac?
You should be calling me your Romeo
'Cause I'm looking for my Juliet
You say I want my cake and eat it too
I'm digging every chick up in this school
From time and time again, I tell you
I got nothing but love for you

[Chorus]
I got nothing but love for you, baby
Got nothing but love for you, baby
Cross my heart, girl, I wouldn't lead you on
Nothing but love, nothing but love
I got nothing but love for you, baby
Just believe these words that I'm saying
Got nothing but love for you, baby
Nothing but love, nothing but love

[Verse 2]
I can't help that half of these chicks in school be digging me
It's just who I am, girl you need to know, oh girl, you should know)
But I can tell that I want you here right next to me
Though you be raising hell, time and time again, I say

[Chorus]
I got nothing but love for you, baby
Got nothing but love for you, baby
Cross my heart, girl, I wouldn't lead you on
Nothing but love, nothing but love
I got nothing but love for you, baby
Just believe these words that I'm saying
Got nothing but love for you, baby
Nothing but love, nothing but love

[Bridge]
Wait, wait hold up, pause, just for minute
'Cause I need a minute to let you know what's really real
Yeah, yeah you know it, hold up, I need second, baby, wait I gotta finish
You think you know what I feel, time and time again, I say

[Chorus]
I got nothing but love for you, baby
Got nothing but love for you, baby
Cross my heart, girl, I wouldn't lead you on
Nothing but love, nothing but love
I got nothing but love for you, baby
Just believe these words that I'm saying
Got nothing but love for you, baby
Nothing but love, nothing but love
I got nothing but love for you, baby
Got nothing but love for you, baby
Cross my heart, girl, I wouldn't lead you on
Nothing but love, nothing but love
I got nothing but love for you, baby
Just believe these words that I'm saying
Got nothing but love for you, baby
Nothing but love, nothing but love
