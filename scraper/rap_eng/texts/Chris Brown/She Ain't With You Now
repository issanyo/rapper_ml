[Verse 1: Golde]
She said she wanna roll with me tonight
I'ma set her free tonight
And we gon' beat the streets tonight
'Cause she just wanna live this life, yeah
She gon' put it down for the pick up
And she gotta make stories to tell
She hate being home by herself
So she grabbed a couple friends and they pull up on me and my niggas
Yeah, we getting lit
It's only 10:30 and she say her phone dead
Do you really believe everything the hoe said?
Or 30 more minutes, lights out, cold read, girl

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Golde]
Yeah, you know what it is, yeah
One rule, no catching no feelings
Yeah, I ain't seen no ring on it
Put her on the mic, then I made her sing on it
Yeah, keep it 100
You don't really want it, you want it 'cause I'm on it
Yeah, she was yours before
She ain't with you now though

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Golde]
She ain't with you now, yeah (she ain't)
She ain't with you now (she ain't with you now, baby)
She ain't with you now though (ooh)
She ain't with you now (she ain't with you now though)
She ain't with you now though (she ain't with you now)
She ain't with you now (she ain't with you now though)
She ain't with you now though (she ain't with you now though)
She ain't with you now (she ain't with you now though)
She ain't with you now (she ain't with you now though)
She ain't with you now

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Oh Lord, it's a bunch of bad bitches
Know that pussy killer, I'm about to be a victim
RIP, I'm 'bout to give that ass the business
I'ma lick her down in the bed, fuck eatin' in the kitchen
Yeah, I'm 'bout to make your nigga jealous
Fly them propellors in Margielas, there ain't nothin' you can tell us
Yeah, now you mad, you ain't know 'bout me
I'm the king, nigga, better not bring your hoe round me, I tell her

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah, you know what it is, yeah
One rule, no catching no feelings
Yeah, I ain't seen no ring on it
Put her on the mic, then I made her sing on it
Yeah, keep it 100
You don't really want it, you want it 'cause I'm on it
Yeah, she was yours before
She ain't with you now though

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Golde]
She ain't with you now (she ain't)
She ain't with you now (she ain't with you now, baby)
She ain't with you now though (ooh)
She ain't with you now (she ain't with you now though)
She ain't with you now though (she ain't with you now)
She ain't with you now (she ain't with you now though)
She ain't with you now though (she ain't with you now though)
She ain't with you now (she ain't with you now though)
She ain't with you now (she ain't with you now though)
She ain't with you now

[Verse 3: R. Kelly & Chris Brown]
And I know you had her first (you had her first)
But I didn't see no ring upon her finger (I don't know why)
I don't know why you tripping
You should have never let her go
'Cause one man's trash is another man's treasure
She ain't with you now though
She ain't with you now, oh, woah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & R. Kelly]
She ain't with you now (now)
She ain't with you now (she ain't with you now)
She ain't with you now though (she ain't with you now)
Why you tripping? She's not with you now
She ain't with you now though (woah, baby)
She ain't with you now though (she ain't with you now, woah, baby)
She ain't with you now though (she ain't with you now though, woah, baby)
Oh, no, no

[Outro: R. Kelly & Chris Brown]
She's no longer your baby (oh)
Now she is my baby (oh)
Homie, you tripping
Get out of your feelings, oh
Ooh, she ain't with you now
She ain't with you now though
