[Verse 1]
All my life
Can't imagine where I'd be without my baby
Boy, and ain't it too complicated
Just the love with you baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever since you walked through the door
Knew I never could let you go, no
Like a river, boy, we just flow
Like a flower, our love will grow, forever

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there for you
If ever the sun don't shine
I'll be there for you
No matter the distance
Oh na na, no matter the time, oh na na
Whatever you need, it's yours, it's mine
For your love, I'll be there for you, for you

[Verse 2]
Looking up
Limit is the sky, for two stars
There's no one who could take away the joy
And break my heart
[Pre-Chorus]
Ever since you walked through the door
Knew I never could let you go, no
Like a river, boy, we just flow
Like a flower, our love will grow, forever

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there for you
If ever the sun don't shine
I'll be there for you
No matter the distance
Oh na na, no matter the time, oh na na
Whatever you need, it's yours, it's mine
For your love, I'll be there for you, for you

[Bridge]
They say love don't last forever
But it will if you want it to
We can make it through whatever
I'ma give this promise to you forever

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there for you
If ever the sun don't shine
I'll be there for you
No matter the distance
Oh na na, no matter the time, oh na na
Whatever you need, it's yours, it's mine
For your love, I'll be there for you, for you
