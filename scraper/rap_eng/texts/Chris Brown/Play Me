[Verse 1]
Girl I've been waiting up all night, sipping tryna get rid of this pain
Henney in my cup all night and it don't even matter if I take that
They can never take your mistakes back, even if I take every sip of this bottle
Ain't a damn thing can erase that, the shit you did way hard to swallow

[Pre-Chorus]
I better take one to the head now
'Fore they get back, I'mma take two to my bed now
But you a memory, best believe I'mma lay it down
For all the bullshit that be going through my head now

[Chorus]
It's fucked up how you played me
It's fucked up how you played me
It's fucked up how you played me
So you might as well just erase me, gon' and erase me
She on but a nigga just can't keep on
So gon' erase me
She on but a nigga just can't keep on
Gon' erase me

[Verse 2]
Valet finna pull up, this girl couldn't be fuller
Now you up in that place and the DJ ain't the only one 'bout to pull up
I need you to know this ain't all about you, this ain't all about you now
When I do my thing, women in my Range, I'mma need me a bounty hunt

[Pre-Chorus]
One to the head now
'Fore they get back, I'mma take two to my bed now
But with you a memory, best believe I'mma lay it down, I'mma lay it down, I'mma lay it down
For all the shit going through my head now, for all the shit going through my head now

[Chorus]
It's fucked up how you played me
It's fucked up how you played me
It's fucked up how you played me
So you might as well just erase me
It's fucked up how you played me
It's fucked up how you played me
It's fucked up how you played me
So you might as well just erase me, gon' and erase me
She on but a nigga just can't keep on
So gon' erase me
She on but a nigga just can't keep on
Gon' erase me
