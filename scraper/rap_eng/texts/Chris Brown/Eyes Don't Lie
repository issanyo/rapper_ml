[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I see you working, tryna be an angel for me
Nobody's perfect, no lie
You acting scared on purpose, with the devil all on your shoulder
He be lurking and girl, I know you want it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
‘Cause your eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie
You’re trying hard to fight it, you can’t deny it
‘Cause your eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie
You try so hard, but you want it

[Bridge: Joelle James]
Is it what you want me to be?
Everything you want in a freak?
So come and put your hands on me
Baby, bring it out of me
Is it what you want me to be?
Everything you want in a freak?
So come and put your hands on me
Baby, bring it out of me

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
The way you’re acting stubborn, don't play with my time
Stop acting out of line, with your, with your games
You deserve an Oscar but this scene about to change
Baby, this is the part where you tell me you love me
I want you now but you say not now, don’t think right now, now
What you thinking ‘bout, we can bang, bang now, bang, bang right now
You an animal, I done made you out
And girl, it's in my human nature to take you down

[Refrain: Chris Brown]
See ‘cause your body  is telling me things, that your mouth won’t say (won’t say)
And if you want me (yeah) do something ‘bout it (yeah), baby, we can talk about it (yeah)
Baby, you can keep me waiting all night, I’ma put that shit all up in your life
And I can bet that you gon’ miss it, baby, when I kiss it, oh woah, no, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I see you working, tryna be an angel for me
Nobody's perfect, no lie
You acting scared on purpose, with the devil all on your shoulder
He be lurking and girl, I know you want it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
‘Cause your eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie
You’re trying hard to fight it, you can’t deny it
‘Cause your eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie
You try so hard, but you want it

[Bridge: Joelle James]
Is it what you want me to be?
Everything you want in a freak?
So come and put your hands on me
Baby, bring it out of me
Is it what you want me to be?
Everything you want in a freak?
So come and put your hands on me
Baby, bring it out of me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Just come on, let's do something
Put it all on me, I love you, baby
We can do more, a little more
Open up to me, yeah

[Refrain: Chris Brown]
Your body is telling me things, that your mouth won’t say (won’t say)
And if you want me (yeah) do something ‘bout it (yeah), baby, we can talk about it (yeah)
Baby, you can keep me waiting all night, I’ma put that shit all up in your life
And I can bet that you gon’ miss it, baby, when I kiss it, oh woah, no, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I see you working, tryna be an angel for me

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
‘Cause your eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie
You’re trying hard to fight it, you can’t deny it
‘Cause your eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie, eyes don’t lie
You try so hard, but you want it
