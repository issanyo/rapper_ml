[Intro: Sevyn Streeter]
Heaven set a trap
That's why you're here
Heaven set a trap
You'll be fine, my dear

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Modest with the body of a goddess
I'll admit it, she's slowing me down, oh yeah
Reason why she is leaving me a paper trail
I'm still tryna figure it out, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Playing follow the leader
To drink from the river, no
It taste so damn good, ooh, woah
Wherever you're taking me
Hope there's possibility in saving us, yeah
'Cause if you keep on tempting me
With that apple from the tree, girl, I promise
We gon' need deliverance

[Post-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
Heaven set a trap
That's why you're here
Heaven set a trap
You'll be fine, my dear
Heaven set a trap
That's why you're here
Heaven set a trap
You'll be fine, my dear

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Laying in the middle of your garden
Ain't got no leaf to cover me now, now, oh
You're my one way ticket to destruction
But I'm packing ready to head out, oh, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Playing follow the leader
To drink from the river, no
It taste so damn good, ooh, woah
Wherever you're taking me
Hope there's possibility in saving us, yeah
'Cause if you keep on tempting me
With that apple from the tree, girl, I promise
We gon' need deliverance

[Post-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
Heaven set a trap
That's why you're here
Heaven set a trap
You'll be fine, my dear
Heaven set a trap
That's why you're here
Heaven set a trap
You'll be fine, my dear

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Wherever you're taking me
Hope there's possibility in saving us, yeah
'Cause if you keep on tempting me
With that apple from the tree, girl, I promise
We gon' need deliverance
We gon' need deliverance, aw yeah, yeah
