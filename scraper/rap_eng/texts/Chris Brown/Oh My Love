[Verse 1]
I'm a bad man but I'm a sucker for love like I'm an addict, girl I really love the way you're looking at me
So I'mma show you the meaning of what a man is, I'm nasty
Car go zoom-zoom and the speakers in the trunk go boom-boom, I can give it to you faster or slow
Girl I'm a gentleman I'll open your door, get the party started like

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa-whoa, spending a lot tonight, hoping you stay tonight ending the party right
Whoa-whoa, take everything off your mind, we can just take our time, whatever you want, want
I-I, got a lot of money but that don't mean shit cause I need you honey
Baby, I gotta have you girl
Lemme get it, when I get it, if I get it, I'mma kill it
Baby, when you get it we be rolling on the floor like
Baby, you so gifted when you kissing on my lips
Then when we switching the position you ain't ever gotta slow down
I can be the, be the lover, lover of ya life
I just wanna be under the covers for the night
Back, back, back up, take a look around
Put your hands in the air like the ceiling's falling down

[Chorus]
Take a chance with me, girl you know that I won't do you no harm
Oh my love, you got my heart, heart, heart
Yeah, you know we're meant to be, yeah, all this magic you should wish on a star
Oh my love you got my heart, heart, heart
