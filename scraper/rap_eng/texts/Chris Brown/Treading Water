[Verse 1]
You said I'm not giving enough but baby girl, I'm trying so hard to keep up
When you fear that I'ma always leave you lonely
But you see that I want us to last forever
And my heart stays open, darling, you know it will get better

[Pre-Chorus]
But you know that shit won’t happen over night
We just gotta give love a try
And when you look beside you
Girl, I’ll be there

[Chorus]
When it rains down your face
Tell me where do the tears end up?
Don’t wanna drown in the rivers of your sorrow
And I, I will swim a thousand miles just for one minute to see you smile
So I'm treading water, treading water
Please don’t cry 'cause you're drowning me

[Verse 2]
What do you say? What do you mean that you blame me?
Why is it today that you doubted me?
That I'ma always leave you lonely, but you see that I want us to last forever
And my heart stays open, darling, you know it will get better

[Pre-Chorus]
But you know that shit won’t happen over night
We just gotta give love a try
And when you look beside you
Girl, I’ll be there

[Chorus]
When it rains down your face
Tell me where do the tears end up?
Don’t wanna drown in the rivers of your sorrow
And I, I will swim a thousand miles just for one minute to see you smile
So I'm treading water, treading water
Please don’t cry 'cause you're drowning me
