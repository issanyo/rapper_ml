[Verse 1]
Had an epiphany, and this what it seems
These smoking mirrors don't wanna believe
For far too long they've been plotting on me
The story's unfolding now, it's a conspiracy

[Pre-Chorus]
Starting to feel like a deja vu
I remember being here, must be a glitch in the matrix
Look around, they all got the same face on
I'm standing by the phone, someone call me

[Chorus]
Bring me to life, show me how to live
'Cause I lose control, feeling like Neo
In the matrix, I just wanna live
I just wanna live, oh woah
I took a red and a blue pill, now I
Can't decide what's make believe or real
Am I awake or am I still asleep?
It's killing me

[Verse 2]
Into the oracle, I wanted to know
What I was supposed to do, she said I see on my own
And the craziest thing is that you already know
How to decipher the signs on the side of the road

[Pre-Chorus]
Starting to feel like a deja vu
I remember being here, must be a glitch in the matrix
Look around, they all got the same face on
I'm standing by the phone, someone call me

[Chorus]
Bring me to life, show me how to live
'Cause I lose control, feeling like Neo
In the matrix, I just wanna live
I just wanna live, oh woah
I took a red and a blue pill, now I
Can't decide what's make believe or real
Am I awake or am I still asleep?
It's killing me

[Bridge]
I need you, you gotta help me
I'm part human, part android
I need your power so you can't judge me
Judge me, oh woah, stuck in the matrix, oh, bring me to life

[Chorus]
Bring me to life, show me how to live
'Cause I lose control, feeling like Neo
In the matrix, I just wanna live
I just wanna live, oh woah
