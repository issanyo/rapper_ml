[Intro: Kodak Black]
Ay Kodak, yeah, I'm fresh out man, this that summer jam man
Y'all slide this shit 'til school start back

Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Girl I wanna be your lover, we can do this all night, right now
But first let me get a lil drank in me
Snapple with a lil Henny, under the hood got a big Hemmey, vibes loud
Oh yeah babe, you gon' feel it when you vibe with me
We all on each other, from the minute you walked in the club
I ain't gotta lie to you cause you know it, I think I'm 'bout to fall in love
Right now now, we should get ready cause I'm in the mood
I'm tryna do something to you, but baby hold up

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Yeah, champagne on the way, it's a time and a place
Baby girl, I wanna take off everything, but I gotta wait
You're gone, wanting your body
But it's a time and a place, oh girl, I gotta wait

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Look, I'm 'bout to slide on ya ass
I ain't lookin' at ya, got my eyes on the cash
Baby daddy with me, he on C class
Look, I kill the scene then flies on ya ass
I feel codeine in my tank
But I'mma pump 89 for the gas
Summertime niggas on the grind with the slab
Overtime nigga finna ride 'til ya crash
Baby I ain't tryna make ya laugh, but call me butthead
Got my mind on ya ass
This ain't a disguise, this a mask
This ain't a Nissan, this a Jag
No surprise boy, you know I'm gon' spaz
All that money gettin' boy you know they gon' ask
I ain't finna play, put the .40 on ya ass
In a Audi thing, 240 on the dash

[Verse 3: Mace Supreme]
Robin wings on your pants
Balenciaga Gold denim queen on your ass
Cop a Louis Bag
Kodak in a jag
Put you in a rolls Royce skirt off on they ass
Mitsubishi you a queen in your Porsche
Prada and some Gucci and you rock is Tory burch
Got the trap jumping
Yea it's jumping off of Vert
Shake that ass baby want to see you put in work
Baby we can't lose
Sauced up jimmy choos
Regret about your nigga that's the nigga that you choose
I can really change ya life really soon
Acting like a dummy let that nigga act a fool

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Wait just for a minute, I got her checked out my tab
Fuck uber, you can sit in my lap
When we ride the Lamborghini, just hold on cause I'm running every red light baby
No breaks, all gas, it's gon' be a long night baby

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Yeah, champagne on the way, it's a time and a place
Baby girl, I wanna take off everything, but I gotta wait
You're gone, wanting your body
But it's a time and a place, oh girl, I gotta wait
