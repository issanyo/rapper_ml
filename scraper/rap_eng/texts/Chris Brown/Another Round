[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back (don't you, don't you)
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back
'Cause in the end, girl, you're gonna want another round, another round (another round, another round)
Girl, you're gonna want another round, another round (another round, another round)
I used to want you and her and her and her and you and her and her
I used to want you and her and her and her, now all I want, all I want is you

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown, Fat Joe & Both]
Shawty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
Bitch badder than any bitch that you name
I'm talkin' Janet, yeah, maybe Kim K
I heard Rihanna, she like it kinky, baby, come on

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Quit playin', girl, you know that you want it
I can tell just by the way you push it out and flaunt it, you bad
Somethin' like Dirty Diana, body dope as heroin
The sex is off the handle
Your ex couldn't beat it, I hit it like a free throw
And since I lost some weight you say I got a big ego (I got a big ego)
It's too strong, you said the drive stick
Well, baby, just peel off
Lovin' how it lasts long, leave the sheets gushy
Fuck you with the mask on, Halloween pussy (haha)
Your body shivers and troubles with each and every stroke
Pussy wetter than ever, enough to sink a boat

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back (don't you, don't you)
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back
'Cause in the end, girl, you're gonna want another round, another round (another round, another round)
Girl, you're gonna want another round, another round (another round, another round)
I used to want you and her and her and her and you and her and her
I used to want you and her and her and her, now all I want, all I want is you

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown, Fat Joe & Both]
Shawty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
Bitch badder than any bitch that you name
I'm talkin' Janet, yeah, maybe Kim K
I heard Rihanna, she like it kinky, baby, come on

[Verse 2: Fat Joe & Chris Brown & Both]
Never hesitate, purchasin' in every state
Transported in foreign cars to large estates
So believe me, you know you wanna come home, girl
As long as we can kick it with your home girl
A two on one fast break, that's a slam dunk
I know you want it, I can take you where ya man won't (yeah)
Champs, Alize, think Rolls Royce (yeah)
Yellow Nuvo and pink boy shorts

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back (don't you, don't you)
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back
'Cause in the end, girl, you're gonna want another round, another round, yeah (another round, another round)
Girl, you're gonna want another round, another round, ooh (another round, another round)
I used to want you and her and her and her and you and her and her
I used to want you and her and her and her, now all I want, all I want is you

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Girl, you got that bomb thing, no, I can't resist
I'ma light them candles, girl, then tie up your wrists
Then I'm licking chocolate right off of your stomach
Baby, you ain't handled freaky shit like this
And I start dripping ice down ya spine, oh, oh
I'ma make you mine
And now you're telling all your girls I done tore it up
So don't be mad that they all want me, there's room for all of us

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't you be holding back your love (yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh)
Don't you be holding back (don't you, don't you)
Don't you be holding back your love (don't you, don't you)
Don't you be holding back
'Cause in the end, girl, you're gonna want another round, another round, oh (another round, another round)
Girl, you're gonna want another round, another round (another round, another round)
I used to want you and her and her and her and you and her and her (you and her and her, her)
I used to want you and her and her and her, now all I want, all I want is you (her)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Shawty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
Bitch badder than any bitch that you name
Go, girl, yeah, just shake it
I want you, baby, naked
