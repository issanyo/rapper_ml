[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
You better hide that pussy
Niggas like us come rob that pussy, snatch that
Stickin' fingers in it
Now got that pussy drippin' need a shower

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
I got 24 hours, 24 hours, it's just me and you
I got 24 hours, 24 hours, 24 hours
Gon' and shake that booty for me
I only got, I only got, 24 hours

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
Baby, you look better with no clothes on, 'bout to pull up to the hotel
I know you gettin' ready for me, got us tickets for the show, yeah
So many girls, but you the only one for me
You like thug niggas, after the show they at the party at the club with us
Yeah, ain't tryna waste no time, know we only here for the night
You and your friends rollin' with me, another day another city 'cause we
Fucked up, off the Henny you know Trigga like to smoke
She got her ass up, you know Breezy like them bitches on the pole

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
Woah, you better hide your pussy
I'ma kill it then I'm gon' revive that pussy
Eat it alive that pussy
I'll American Pie that pussy

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
24 hours, 24 hours, it's just me and you
I got 24 hours, 24 hours, 24 hours
Gon' and shake that booty for me
I only got, I only got, 24 hours

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
It ain't no question what we spendin', I'm 'bout to jump knee deep in it
That pussy sweeter than flowers, ain't gotta eat it in the shower
A nigga drunk, need more liquor, more hoes, yo bitch, no niggas
'Memeber when I used to be a broke nigga? Now it's middle of December on a boat nigga
You know what you came to do tonight
Rich nigga in the club full of gold diggers, she don't need my money, she a go getter
As soon as I touch down you know I'ma hit her, as soon as I touch down she pull down my zipper
Gold Rollie no bust down, bust down, but it's still glitter
We got all night, show me what the pussy like, beat it to the sunshine, give it to me one time
I'm waitin', got me waitin' to eat it like I'm in a lunch line, it's crunch time
We some nasty niggas, we goin' for hours, we outlastin' niggas
'Cause I love women, baby, take off that dress, time limit is

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
24 hours, 24 hours, it's just me and you
I got 24 hours, 24 hours, 24 hours
Gon' and shake that booty for me
I only got, I only got, 24 hours
