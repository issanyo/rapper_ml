[Verse 1]
Said I tried to, to spend a day without you
And it's hard to do, I can't do it
Maybe it's the things you do, you do
Huh, it make a nigga go crazy, guess I'm addicted to you, fuck

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't, I don't wanna keep lying
I need a little you and me time
I wanna lick you, ooh, pussy keep crying
And the neighbors telling us to keep quiet

[Chorus]
Girl, just let go and let this happen
Close your eyes, feel my magic stick, we keep fucking up these mattresses
And my back got all these scratches, rough sex we'll be practicing
Love when we goin' at it

[Verse 2]
With all that ass, you better shake something, you better take off your clothes before I get mad
I need 1 on 1, 1 on 1, quality time, we bump and grinding
Girl, let me see something, you know that I ain't gon' hold back
Don't tease me, woman, don't keep it from me, just please me, woman

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna keep lying, I don't
I need a little you and me time, me time
I wanna lick you, ooh, pussy keep crying, woo
And the neighbors telling us to keep quiet

[Chorus]
Girl, just let go and let this happen (yeah, yeah)
Close your eyes, feel my magic stick, we keep fucking up these mattresses (your eyes)
And my back got all these scratches, yeah, rough sex when we practicing
Love when we going at it, ooh yeah
Girl, just let go and let this happen
Close your eyes, feel my magic stick, we keep fucking up these mattresses
And my back got all these scratches, room six when we practicing
Love when we goin' at it
Girl, just let go and let this happen
Close your eyes, feel my magic stick, we keep fucking up these mattresses
And my back got all these scratches, room six when we practicing
Love when we goin' at it
