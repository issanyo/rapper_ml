Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm all out, finna ball out
Been on my shit when you call out (oh)
I been on bitches since the eighth grade
I got an actress and a Playmate (oh)
Do you wanna ride with me, baby?
In the 6 splashin' up full of models (yep)
Catch your best friends, I'ma get
'Cause they know I'ma lead and they'll follow
Yeah, might put some bands up (yeah, yeah)
I'm the realist nigga, no actor (oh)
Hit it from the back, I'm a factor
Hey, woah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Your partners, they warned me, they told me (warned me, told me)
Let's take it slowly, start as your homie (slowly)
Don't care who you with
You gon' end in my bed
So fuck who you came with
Fuck who you came with, oh

And boss bitches know what we talkin' 'bout
When a nigga's worth it, come after
