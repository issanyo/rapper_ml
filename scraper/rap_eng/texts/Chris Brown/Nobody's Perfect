[Verse 1]
You are natural sweet not just beautiful 'cause you follow your heart
It makes it even more special that you don’t know how damn lovely you are
I would kiss the mirror every single day, if I wake up with your face
What are all these doubts fall spinning in your head? Don’t you look so sad

[Chorus]
Won’t you come right here? Set the mind off you
Nobody nobody, nobody’s perfect but you, yeah
You mean the world to me, I can’t believe you’re true
'Cause nobody nobody, nobody’s perfect but you you you, it's just you you you
Nobody nobody, nobody nobody
Nobody nobody, nobody nobody
Nobody nobody, nobody nobody
Nobody’s perfect but you

[Verse 2]
When you stand close to me I get paralysed, I forget how to breathe
Every place is forsaken and feels so wrong, every time that you leave
You catch me when I'm falling, you bring me back to life, when I'm dying you rise
Now what are all these doubts for spinning in your head? Don’t you look so sad

[Chorus]
Won’t you come right here? Set the mind off you
Nobody nobody nobody’s perfect but you yeah
You mean the world to me
'Cause nobody nobody, nobody’s perfect but you you you, it's just you you you, party, dance
Nobody nobody, nobody nobody
Nobody nobody, nobody nobody
Nobody nobody, nobody’s perfect but you
Yeah, you mean the world to me, nobody nobody, nobody’s perfect but you
Won’t you come right here? Set the mind off you
Nobody nobody, nobody’s perfect but you yeah
You mean the world to me, I can’t believe you’re true
'Cause nobody nobody, nobody’s perfect but you you you, it's just you you you
