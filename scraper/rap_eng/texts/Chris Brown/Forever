[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4
Hey, hey, forever
Hey, hey, forever

[Verse 1]
It's you and me, moving at the speed of light into eternity, yeah
Tonight is the night to join me in the middle of ecstasy
Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music
Around you, around you
I'mma take you there, I'mma take you there
So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby
We can go anywhere, go anywhere
But first, it's your chance, take my hand, come with me

[Chorus]
It's like I've waited my whole life for this one night
It's gon' be me you and the dance floor
Cause we've only got one night
Double your pleasure, double your fun
And dance fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, forever
Fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Forever on the dance floor

[Verse 2]
Feels like we're on another level
Feels like our love's intertwined
We can be two rebels
Breaking the rules, me and you, you and I
All you gotta do is watch me
Look what I can do with my feet, baby, feel the beat inside
I'm driving, you can take the front seat
I just need you to trust me, girl, it's like I've

[Chorus]
It's like I've waited my whole life for this one night
It's gon' be me you and the dance floor
Cause we've only got one night
Double your pleasure, double your fun
And dance fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, forever
Fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Forever on the dance floor

[Bridge]
It's a long way down, we so high off the ground
Sending for an angel to bring me your heart
Girl where did you come from? Got me so undone
Gaze in your eyes got me saying
"What a beautiful lady", no if's, and's or maybes
I'm releasing my heart and it's feeling amazing
There's no one else that matters, you love me
And I won't let you fall, girl, let you fall, girl
I won't let you fall, let you fall, let you fall

[Chorus]
It's like
It's like I've waited my whole life for this one night
It's gon' be me you and the dance floor
Cause we've only got one night
Double your pleasure, double your fun
And dance fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, forever
Fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Forever on the dance floor

[Outro]
Forever, ever, ever
Forever, ever...
