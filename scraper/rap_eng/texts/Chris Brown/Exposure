[Intro]
Murda on the beat so it's not nice

[Chorus]
Exposure, curve cameras
The way you dutty whine, you no need me to lie
Exposure, curve cameras
Paparazzi shots, no, they don’t define us
Exposure, curve cameras
The way you dutty whine, you no need me to lie
Exposure, curve cameras
Paparazzi shots, no, they don’t define us

[Verse 1]
Exposure (oh)
Could give a fuck about the news
The news 'cause you know
Once I get lost in the ocean
Girl, you wet like a tidal wave drinking
All the ice on me, cold like December
Sex was so good, I remember
All the lights and they flashin’

[Chorus]
Exposure, curve cameras
The way you dutty whine, you no need me to lie
Exposure, curve cameras
Paparazzi shots, no, they don’t define us
Exposure, curve cameras
The way you dutty whine, you no need me to lie
Exposure, curve cameras
Paparazzi shots, no, they don’t define us

[Bridge]
Exposure (oh)
Girl, I’m in love with you
You know
I know you hate the flashes

[Chorus]
Exposure, curve cameras
The way you dutty whine, you no need me to lie
Exposure, curve cameras
Paparazzi shots, no, they don’t define us
Exposure
