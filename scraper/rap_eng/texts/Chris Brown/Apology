[Verse 1]
You don't even call anymore
It's so different from the way it was before
Every day I hear your pretty voice
I have no choice but to be all alone without you
There's so many mistakes we make in love
'Cause still I'm thinking this is something we can solve
I'll take all the blame for breaking your heart
But you can't let it tear us apart because

[Chorus]
She didn't mean anything to me (Nothing)
She wasn't the one I see in my dreams (Oh, no)
Girl, you know it ain't true, if you believe (Yeah)
Please accept my apology
Please accept my apology
I didn't mean to hurt you, girl

[Verse 2]
I didn't see myself settling down
But I knew from the first time you came around
From the moment I looked into your eyes
I never wanted to see you cry over me
But I knew if we got serious in love
We would never, ever wanna break it up
I wasn't ready for you until this day
Could you believe when I say that sheâ€”?

[Chorus]
She didn't mean anything to me (No, she didn't)
She wasn't the one I see in my dreams (No she was not, yeah)
Girl, you know it ain't true, if you believe
Please accept my apology
Baby, I didn't mean
I didn't mean to hurt you, girl
She didn't mean anything to me (No, woah)
She wasn't the one I see in my dreams
Girl, you know it ain't true, if you believe
Please accept my apology, woah
I didn't mean to hurt you, girl
