[Verse 1]
Filter out the pain
If you gonna take my breath away
Black lungs, intoxicating
I'm addicted to your poison

[Chorus]
There it goes, I'm just faded as fast as she came
If I died then you know who to blame, all because of you
You give me second hand love like second hand smoke
I keep breathing it in, that's just how it goes with you, I'm used to your poison
You give me second hand love like second hand smoke
I keep breathing it in, that's just how it goes with you, you're killing me slowly

[Verse 2]
Nicotine dreams, gas lit lover
Temporary high, then I suffer, take my breath away
I think it's what I need, you took all of my nightmares out the safe
Girl your menthol kisses, I made my business, now my breathing's different

[Chorus]
There it goes, I'm just faded as fast as she came
If I died then you know who to blame, all because of you
You give me second hand love like second hand smoke
I keep breathing it in, that's just how it goes with you, I'm used to your poison
You give me second hand love like second hand smoke
I keep breathing it in, that's just how it goes with you, you're killing me slowly

[Bridge]
Carry me girl, carry me, carry me away
Like the smoke that, like the smoke that you blew my way
How could you babe? How could you babe?
Put a filter on your love, aw yeah
Carry me girl, carry me, carry me away
Carry me girl, carry me, carry me away
Like the smoke that, like the smoke that you blew my way

[Chorus]
There it goes, I'm just faded as fast as she came
If I died then you know who to blame, all because of you
You give me second hand love like second hand smoke
I keep breathing it in, that's just how it goes with you, I'm used to your poison
You give me second hand love like second hand smoke
I keep breathing it in, that's just how it goes with you, you're killing me slowly
