[Verse 1]
Sometimes I don't wanna wake up alone
But sometimes I wanna wake up and be on my own
Sometimes I don't wanna walk by and smile
But at the same time, I don't wanna let people down

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you imagine, the weight of a world
Placed on your shoulders, trapped in this world?
And no one can reach you, ooh
So no one can help you, now

[Chorus]
It's getting heavy, I think I'm 'bout ready to break down
I'm standing up, but I'm fallin' down
Time keeps on ticking, I wish there was a way to slow it down
Someone pick me up cause I'm fallin' down
Fallin' down down down down down down down
Fallin' down down down down down down down

[Verse 2]
Why is it so easy for you to blame?
I'm only human, we're all the same
I've given up everything in exchange for being alone
I'm shaking these demons underneath all the pride

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you imagine, the weight of a world
Placed on your shoulders, trapped in this world?
And no one can reach you, ooh
So no one can help you, now

[Chorus]
It's getting heavy, I think I'm 'bout ready to break down
I'm standing up, but I'm fallin' down
Time keeps on ticking, I wish there was a way to slow it down
Someone pick me up cause I'm fallin' down
Fallin' down down down down down down down
Fallin' down down down down down down down
It's getting heavy, I think I'm 'bout ready to break down
I'm standing up, but I'm fallin' down
Time keeps on ticking, I wish there was a way to slow it down
Someone pick me up cause I'm fallin' down
Fallin' down down down down down down down
Fallin' down down down down down down down
It's getting heavy, I think I'm 'bout ready to break down
I'm standing up, but I'm fallin' down
Time keeps on ticking, I wish there was a way to slow it down
Someone pick me up cause I'm fallin' down
Fallin' down down down down down down down
Fallin' down down down down down down down
