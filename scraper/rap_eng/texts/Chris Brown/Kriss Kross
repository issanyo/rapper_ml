[Chorus: Chris Brown]
VVS Patek all in my wrist watch (wrist)
Got it jump, jumpin' like I'm Kriss Kross
She gon' bring her girl, let 'em Kriss Kross
Drippin' water, I forgot to turn my wrist off
All that Goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that Goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
She gon' bring her girl, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that Goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Hoe I'm flossin', tell your bitch get off
Hit it once and had her feelin' nauseous, yeah
She pop that pussy, put that pressure on her
I got a lot of freaks that live in Arizona
Now I'm seein' things, sippin' on gasoline
Poppin' the Xan, I got the soda and the promethazine
Five in the mornin', she keep me up like Folgers
She say she wanted an orgy, like hold up baby, there's more of us, you know I'm a nasty nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
VVS Patek all in my wrist watch (wrist)
Got it jump, jumpin' like I'm Kriss Kross (boing)
She gon' bring her girl, let 'em Kriss Kross (call yo bitch)
Drippin' water, I forgot to turn my wrist off (my bad)
All that Goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that Goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
She gon' bring her girl, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that Goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross

[Verse 2: Luvaboy TJ]
Reachin' for my Goyard yeah, I'mma catch a charge
Don't make my chopper bark, I'm a fuckin' dog
We could take it to the yard, order firearms
All my niggas, we go dumb, bomb it like Saddam
Get it straight, now I can't relate
Most you niggas fake, tryna infiltrate
Got gold golds at the gate
Grab 'em up quick, toss 'em in the lake
Check that goyard on my bezzel
Goyard on my wri-sist
Your bitch, she can't resist
Assist me for some interest
There it go

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
VVS Patek all in my wrist watch (yeah, yeah)
Got it jump, jumpin' like I'm Kriss Kross (boing)
She gon' bring her girl, let 'em Kriss Kross (call yo bitch)
Drippin' water, I forgot to turn my wrist off (my bad)
All that Goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that Goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
She gon' bring her girl, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that Goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross

[Verse 3: Young Blacc]
Get killed if they crossin' me
You spray me so much that they swear that they lossin' me
We drippin' in saucy
Don't fuck with you niggas that be on that broke shit
Rap niggas, I expose 'em
Strapped up like a soldier
Phone calls, yeah I'm big homie
Gettin' packed, I was on another
I'm chuckin' in Phantom
I'm doin' 100, the same for the ransom
Hear they good with them cameras
We be takin' that shit, everyone put your hands up
OHB, that's the mob, nigga
Blackout, do the job, nigga
Out of town with a passport
On Sunset, you get robbed nigga, I mean that

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
VVS Patek all in my wrist watch (yeah, yeah)
Got it jump, jumpin' like I'm Kriss Kross (boing)
She gon' bring her girl, let 'em Kriss Kross (call yo bitch)
Drippin' water, I forgot to turn my wrist off (my bad)
All that Goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that Goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
She gon' bring her girl, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that Goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
