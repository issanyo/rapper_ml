[Verse 1]
I'm not shallow
And I know what girls got her needs
All the guys say, "She blows"
'Cause that's what makes her very special to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is she now?
She's got one night on the town
When she comes to my house
I know I'ma nail her now

[Chorus]
You're a skank, you're a whore
You're a slut, but I like it, I like it
Everyone gets a turn like a door
But I like it, I like it
And I don't really like you classy
'Cause I want a girl who's trashy
You're a skank, you're a whore
You're a slut, but I like it, I like it
The way you are

[Verse 2]
Everywhere she goes
She thinks that guys are wonderful
And she likes to smoke
And drink margaritas

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is she now?
She just left my best friend's house
I should kick her out
But she's so fucking awesome

[Chorus]
You're a skank, you're a whore
You're a slut, but I like it, I like it
Everyone gets a turn like a door
But I like it, I like it
And I don't really like you classy
'Cause I want a girl who's trashy
You're a skank, you're a whore
You're a slut, but I like it, I like it
The way you are

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
You're a skank, you're a whore
You're a slut, but I like it, I like it
Everyone gets a turn like a door
But I like it, I like it
And I don't really like you classy
'Cause I want a girl who's trashy
You're a skank, you're a whore
You're a slut, but I like it, I like it
The way you are
