[Verse 1]
I see you writing on my wall, why you wanna do that?
My name's tagged you already see that
The media wanna paint it all black and they do it right in my face
See I can't sit back and let it all wash away
I worked too hard for it to be erased
Before you talk, I'mma finish what I gotta say

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I already put in time with all of my grinding, all of my grinding
You know I grind, through all of this struggle all of this struggle, even through the pain I still had to hustle
Man I had to feed my family, and at the same time keep my sanity
Oh no, man I can't let you do it

[Chorus]
Graffiti you're tryna spray, spray on me
Graffiti you're tryna spray, on my name
Graffiti you're tryna spray, spray on me
All the graffiti you're tryna spray, on my name
But it's already written on the wall
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up
But it's already written on the wall
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up

[Verse 2]
Who got award shows rocking every time I hit the stage?
Even the haters went and bought a CD
Without my fans, I'm an empty spray can and I just can't paint a thing
Seems like the less I had the money, the less I had the problems
The more I got the money, the more I got the problems, ayo
Let me clear my throat, gotta make sure you hear me go

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I already put in time with all of my grinding, all of my grinding
You know I grind, through all of this struggle all of this struggle, even through the pain I still had to hustle
Man I had to feed my family, and at the same time keep my sanity
Oh no, man I can't let you do it

[Chorus]
Graffiti you're tryna spray, spray on me
Graffiti you're tryna spray, on my name
Graffiti you're tryna spray, spray on me
All the graffiti you're tryna spray, on my name
But it's already written on the wall
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up
But it's already written on the wall
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up

[Bridge]
It's already done, ain't gotta paint no more
All this pain that I've endured
I know I was wrong for what I did and I made some mistakes cause I'm human
I ain't gon' feed into the negative
I'mma keep grinding, oh yeah
But this graffiti, oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I already put in time with all of my grinding, all of my grinding
You know I grind, through all of this struggle all of this struggle, even through the pain I still had to hustle
Man I had to feed my family, and at the same time keep my sanity
Oh no, man I can't let you do it

[Chorus]
Graffiti you're tryna spray, spray on me
Graffiti you're tryna spray, on my name
Graffiti you're tryna spray, spray on me
All the graffiti you're tryna spray, on my name
But it's already written on the wall
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up
But it's already written on the wall
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up
