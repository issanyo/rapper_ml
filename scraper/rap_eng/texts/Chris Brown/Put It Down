Verse-
I see you girl keepin up wit dat fitness
You got fine written all over you can I get a witness?
Got me gettin on one knee at the age of adolescent
My lyrical technique is unique i betchu like my methods

When cloud nine falls you bet we take its place
I looked all over Kansas and you were right here in my face
Got me stuck on like paste my heart beats a new pace
Olympic cranium titanium speed up in this chase like itsa race

By the rate we goin I gotta put it down
Gon head and grab a shovel we further than the ground
SHHHH
Don't make a sound

Droppa
Piece of love

So 'Do it for the Vine'
I ain't gon do it

Unless it's ground cinnamon
I don't want no funny business
Let's keep it intimate

Hook
Chorus

Imma put it down 4x)
Imma put it down 3x)

Shes cherry on top of a sundae
Icing on the cake
Your a Friday over Monday
Do you know how warm you make me?
If you don't better
Recognize it
Better receive it
Better conceive it
Bette believe it
This is some chick flick it picks it itches it ticks it's it so stick wit it yea I hit it yea

You my honey boo minus the toto
I keep it coo to
Never would use you
This is the truth boo
I don't wanna lose you
Dramatic, not magic, traumatic if I didn't choose you

I's gotta put it down never wanna be MIA
I gotta be protective baby like the CIA
I gotta be more safe like FBI, enough wit the abbreviated stuff
FYI IDKY

I just gotta breathe

I just gotta breathe

Yea
Tell em Chris Brown

Hook
Chorus
