[Intro]
K-K-K-K-K-K-Mac

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
All that bullshit's for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture (Oh, oh, oh)
Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Chu-chuckin' up them deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Yeah, yeah)
Told you that I'm leaving, deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah, woah)
I know you're mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan
Ayy, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talkin', but I guess that you ain't listenin'
Rather run around with them nothin'-ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smokin' like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you
To see her in that two-seater, know that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me by now?
So you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released, into the wind
Again, again, and deuces I must throw ya, peace

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Got a pocket full of hundreds, she the only one that's missin'
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it (Ugh!)
Got a racin' Lamborghini, have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down, they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talkin' ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in that Hall of Fame (Ugh!)
I let my denim sag, red Louis belt
How can you love me, baby? First, you gotta love yourself

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
