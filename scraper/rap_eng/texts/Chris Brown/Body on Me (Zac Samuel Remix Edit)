[Chorus: Rita Ora & Chris Brown]
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Heyo, heyo, if you want it, then you got it, hold me (yeah)
No more, no more wasting time, we can, we can go all night (oh, yeah, we can go all night)
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me (your body)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Your body on me
Yeah, oh
Your body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Your body on me

[Verse 1: Rita Ora]
Baby, let's cut down the lights
I just really wanna let this fire burn bright
I'm just telling you to have an open mind
Just imagine us (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & Chris Brown]
You're taking me there, you're taking me there
Our lips are barely touching (oh, oh, oh)
So do it again, so do it again
We could be on to something (oh, oh)

[Chorus: Rita Ora & Chris Brown]
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Heyo, heyo, if you want it, then you got it, hold me (yeah)
No more, no more wasting time, we can, we can go all night (oh, yeah, we can go all night)
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me (your body)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Your body on me
Yeah, oh
Your body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Your body on me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Put you up against the wall
And I'ma go to work 'til you get off
Baby, soon as you're done, we'll go some more, oh, oh
Girl, just imagine us

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & Chris Brown]
You're taking me there, you're taking me there
Our lips are barely touching (oh, oh, oh)
So do it again, so do it again
We could be on to something (oh, oh)

[Chorus: Rita Ora & Chris Brown]
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Heyo, heyo, if you want it, then you got it, hold me (yeah)
No more, no more wasting time, we can, we can go all night (oh, yeah, we can go all night)
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me (your body)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Your body on me
Yeah, oh
Your body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Your body on me

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Rita Ora]
I'm not asking for too much, put your fingertips on me
Don't wait 'til the sun's up, we can keep this thing between us
Only nobody has to know what's going down right now, baby (hey)

[Chorus: Rita Ora & Chris Brown]
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Heyo, heyo, if you want it, then you got it, hold me (yeah)
No more, no more wasting time, we can, we can go all night (we can go all night)
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me (hey, oh, oh)
Ayayayayayayayayaya (hey, yeah, oh, yeah)
Your body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya (on me, oh, oh. oh, oh)
Your body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya (ooh, yeah, oh, yeah)
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Your body on me
