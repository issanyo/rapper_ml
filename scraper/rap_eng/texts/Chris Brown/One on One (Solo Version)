[Chorus]
I don’t have to leave, so I'm gonna stay over
Climb on top of me and just ride, just ride it
It's just gonna be me and you together
One on one when I love you, babe, one on one when I love you, babe
I ain’t worried ’bout shit, babe, when I love you
All of your rent paid, when I love you
Give you all of my shit, babe, when I love you
No matter where you are, you the shit, babe, when I love you

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm coming home to you, I'm getting off kinda early
I loosen my top, the thought of your thighs, I wanna get dirty
If I put it in, I might just hurt it
You gon' make me take the day off

[Pre-Chorus]
Must not know me, I can't hit it one time, gIrl, you know I gotta come back
'Cause you blow my mind, along with other things
Can we go round three? Don't waste this time, wasting time
Break that body down and do a slow whine just for me, 'cause I

[Chorus]
I don’t have to leave, so I'm gonna stay over
Climb on top of me and just ride, just ride it (climb on top of me, ride, ride)
It's just gonna be me and you together (me and you together)
One on one when I love you, babe, one on one when I love you, babe
I ain’t worried ’bout shit, babe, when I love you
Fuck what that bitch say, when I love you
Give you all of my shit, babe, when I love you
You know that you that bitch, babe, when I love you

[Verse 2]
Whatever you buy, it's okay
I see you trying on that dress, pick up them J's for me
Spend it all on you, all for you, let's go all the way
This girl gon' leave right now, you got me, going crazy, girl, I'm out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Must not know me, I can't hit it one time, girl, you know I gotta come back
'Cause you blow my mind, along with other things
And can we go round three? Don’t waste this time, wasting time
Break that body down and do a slow wine just for me, 'cause I

[Chorus]
I don’t have to leave, so I'm gonna stay over (stay over)
Climb on top of me and just ride, just ride it (ride)
It's just gonna be me and you together (me and you)
One on one when I love you, babe, one on one when I love you, babe (when I love you babe, when I love you babe)
I ain’t worried ’bout shit, babe, when I love you (shit, babe)
Pay for your rent, babe, when I love you (rent, babe)
Give you all of my shit, babe, when I love you (shit, babe)
You know that you the bitch, babe, when I love you (bitch, babe)

[Outro]
You gon' go one on one when I love you (one)
One on one, when I love you (one)
One on one, when I love you (one)
One on one, babe, one on one, babe, girl
One on one, when I love you (one)
One on one, when I love you (one)
One on one, when I love you, babe (one)
I ain’t worried ’bout shit, babe, when I love you
Fuck what that bitch say, when I love you
