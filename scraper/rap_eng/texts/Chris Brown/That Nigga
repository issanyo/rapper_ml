[Intro]
League of Starz
Sorry Jaynari

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Ha, Frank Mueller, the face like a computer
Poppin' them bottles, sprayin' the Ace like Aruga
You got beef, I got shooters
And your bitch about to give me brain, watch me school her
Listen, let me lick it, put it out, make it pop, pop
I'ma cuff the pussy, she think she fucked a cop (ha)
And then I put it back in, make her back bend
And then I fuck her girlfriend like what's happenin'?
Haha, oh baby, for sure, baby
Tell that blockin' ass bitch, let go, baby
Fuck her, just do you and do me
Haha, bitch mad 'cause she ugly (yeah)
You know, I be ballin' like a bitch
Made my own condom's 'cause these bitches on my dick, huh
Pluto, I be higher than a bitch
You know, flyer than a bitch, my car like a spaceship, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Kid Red)]
That nigga, that nigga, everybody know I'm that nigga (you know)
All this money lookin' like a fat nigga (ha) and I bought them killers better bag back, nigga (pow)
Bag back, nigga (ha!) and I bought them killers, better bag back, nigga (wow)
That nigga, bag that nigga, ayy, everybody know I'm that nigga

[Verse 2: Kid Red]
I'm a player, somebody grab my uniform
The bitch head on point like a unicorn
I really keep it G, I went to school for the bitches
I'm about to fuck you at the locker, tryna kiss her
You just talk to 'em, I take 'em home for detention
Just another sex victim that I never call or mention
Gotta keep it pimpin', sorry that's your sister
But I'm on a mission, tell that hoe to keep her distance
Look, I keep a couple hoes in the studio
Rollin' with my wolves with them nines like Rubio
Hoes stop and stare 'cause my pinky glare
Got a hood bitch that let me fuck her on the stairs
She say she needs some J's, so I cop a couple pair
I got a private leer, that'll take her everywhere though
Where your bitch at? She with me, nigga
Kid Red, I'm in the streets, nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
That nigga, that nigga, everybody know I'm that nigga (you know)
All this money lookin' like a fat nigga (ha) and I bought them killers better bag back, nigga (pow)
Bag back, nigga (ha!) and I bought them killers, better bag back, nigga (wow)
That nigga, that nigga, everybody know I'm that nigga

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Everybody know I'm that nigga
I'm about to take that hoe, from that nigga
Ha, here we go, I'm that nigga
"Fuck you Chris," hatin' ass nigga
She 'bout to pop the pills, I just bought the roll up
Put the dick up on her head, that's a weight up on her shoulders
I ain't fuckin' ratchet pussy 'cause that shit is like Ebola
In the club I'm like hold up, fuck a club soda
Need the Ace, I spray it on her face
She fuck with broke niggas, old nigga made her pay
I told her I'ma buy the a bar as long as I can get a taste
Then she bend that ass over and I grabbed her by the waist, told her drop it for me
Damn, that ass sick, I got a doctor for it
My dick got her singin' high, opera on her
Her boyfriend start to trip, niggas pop up on him
Like blocka, blocka, body bag 'cause I'm

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
That nigga, that nigga, everybody know I'm that nigga (you know)
All this money lookin' like a fat nigga (ha) and I bought them killers better bag back, nigga (pow)
Bag back, nigga (ha!) and I bought them killers, better bag back, nigga (wow)
That nigga, that nigga, everybody know I'm that nigga
