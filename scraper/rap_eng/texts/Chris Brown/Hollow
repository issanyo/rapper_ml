[Verse 1]
Baby, I'll admit, I made a mistake
Don't know what I was thinking, what I had was so great
Charged to my mind but not to my heart
I know it ain't fair, sometimes I want it all
Go head and cuss me out, girl, I understand
I'ma stay right here and take it like a man
I really need you back, babe, what I gotta do?
Let me be honest and straight up tell the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven't been the same since I left you
I can't enjoy myself, even if I try to
I'm not happy, it ain't a laughing matter
And you don't understand

[Chorus]
My heart is hollow
I didn't know I'd end up like this
I said I didn't wanna, now I miss you
My heart is hollow
And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud
Baby, I'll scream it out
Don't know what I was thinking 'bout
Hollow
I thought I wanted to spread my wings
But I'm empty tryina do my things out in these streets
I wanna fly back, can I come back home?
Without your love, it's hollow

[Verse 2]
Girl, I will never be the same no more
Promise I can do you better, sincerely yours
And them times I didn't even try
And even when I told them lies, you stayed wonderful, girl
Can I least just get the chance to show you I
That I'm not a little boy, I won't make you cry
And it means now, all we need is time
And we can get back to the way things were

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven't been the same since I left you
I can't enjoy myself, even if I try to
I'm not happy, it ain't a laughing matter
And you don't understand

[Chorus]
My heart is hollow
I didn't know I'd end up like this
I said I didn't wanna, now I miss you
My heart is hollow
And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud
Baby, I'll scream it out
Don't know what I was thinking 'bout
Hollow
I thought I wanted to spread my wings
But I'm empty tryina do my things out in these streets
I wanna fly back, can I come back home?
Without your love, it's hollow

[Bridge]
Only so much I can take, this love is breaking down
Come rescue me, I need your arms gently wrapped around
Say you need me and don't let go
And just to put it simply, girl, my heart is empty

[Chorus]
My heart is hollow
And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud
Baby, I'll scream it out
Don't know what I was thinking 'bout
Hollow
I thought I wanted to spread my wings
But I'm empty tryina do my things out in these streets
I wanna fly back, can I come back home?
Without your love, it's hollow

[Outro]
Girl, girl
