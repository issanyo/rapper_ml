[Chorus: Chris Brown]
On my darkest days
Girl, and I can't seem to find no little peace of mind
Baby, can you scream my name?
Please girl, can you scream my name, scream my name for me?
Scream my name, scream my name for me?
Can you scream my name? Oh, woah, oh

[Verse 1: Joelle James]
Baby, I just feel like giving up
Lately, everything just been too rough
I know you missing all of my calls
I let you see all of my flaws, oh
I gave you my heart, it's not enough
Waiting every day until you're done but you never call
Then you go turn around and swear that you really need my love
So tell me will you be here?

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Joelle James]
On my darkest days
Girl, and I can't seem to find no little peace of mind
Baby, can you scream my name?
Please girl, can you scream my name, scream my name for me?
Scream my name, scream my name for me?
Can you scream my name? Oh, woah, oh

[Verse 2: Joelle James]
Thinking you get everything you want
This a relationship, a scholarship, a free ride
Say that you do everything you don't
Remember all the late nights when I cried?
And now I'm *67 on your phone
Calling blocked, I'm all alone
And you know that I can't sleep, baby
Lord knows I've tried
But I hate when you're away from me, baby
Only 'posed to be mine
All mine, on my darkest days

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Joelle James]
On my darkest days, oh, yeah
Girl, and I can't seem to find no little peace of mind
Baby, can you scream my name?
Please girl, can you scream my name, scream my name for me?
Scream my name, scream my name for me?
Can you scream my name? Oh, woah, oh, oh, oh
On my darkest days
Girl, and I can't seem to find no little peace of mind
Baby, can you scream my name?
Please girl, can you scream my name, scream my name for me? I know, I know I can, babe
Scream my name, scream my name for me?
Can you scream my name? Oh, woah, oh

[Outro: Joelle James]
Oh, oh, oh, woah
Can you scream my name?
Oh, oh, oh, woah
Will you be there for me?
Oh, oh, oh, woah
On my darkest days?
Oh, oh, oh, woah
Oh yeah, can you scream my name?
Oh, oh, oh, woah
Baby
Oh, oh, oh, woah
Can you scream my name?
