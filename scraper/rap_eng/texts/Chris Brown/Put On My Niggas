[Intro: Compton Menace]
What up, what it do?
Aw yeah, let me hit you right back I’m in the booth
Yeah, M.E.N.A.C.E
Look

[Verse 1: Compton Menace]
Yeah, she said started out with hustlin', nothin' I can’t do on my own
At least that’s what I thought until I did it on my own
And never hate on the haters, just look at the motivation
And know the biggest winners, the ones with the most patience
I ride high, keep my head up
One thing niggas scared of is gettin' head up
At a young age I learned how to man up
My dad done said, “You know I had to keep my bands up”
Wassup, for real, yeah, that’s how I do it
Niggas hate to love the Menace 'cause I’m the truest
All I ever really known is how to get it
And stack this paper up and knock hoes off the sex-list
I’m with the masses and these songs for the real niggas
Couple hundred off the rap, think I’m still dealin'
And everybody tryna get a million
But it’s hard when you’re one-in-a-million

[Hook: Chris Brown]
They wanna know what I’m doin', doin', yeah
Why I’m so addicted to the street life
And my mama sayin', nigga, I ain’t livin' right
‘Cause all my niggas down to ride
I’m tryna put on my niggas that’s been down from day one
I'ma try to put on my all niggas, so they can live how they want
Put on, my niggas, I wanna put on, my niggas
I'ma put on my niggas, I'ma put on my niggas

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Tonight’s the night, tonight’s the night
I'ma buy a hundred bottles, we gon' ball out
All my ladies fill it up, yeah, we in this bitch
I put my niggas on we gon' win this bitch

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I can’t stand hate how some niggas hate when you great ‘cause I’m on that boss shit
Nose in the air, that’s why you steppin' on that dog shit
And while you do that I be smokin' on that Marley
Shit, this the function, bitch, you better party
All my niggas in the buildin' with me right now
Hella ladies in this section, I'm 'bout to put my niggas on
Huh, everybody in the same club, I could do this every night and never change up
But if he reach, I'ma reach, I'ma spray up, I'ma paint up, I ain’t gon’ never have my chain tucked
Watch a fuck nigga always tryna blame us
Talkin' that shit just to get his name up
A nigga on the news, guess I’m, guess I’m famous
Yeah, nigga, we made it

[Hook: Chris Brown]
They wanna know what I’m doin', doin', yeah
Why I’m so addicted to the street life
And my mama sayin', nigga, I ain’t livin' right
‘Cause all my niggas down to ride
I’m tryna put on my niggas that’s been down from day one
I'ma try to put on my all niggas, so they can live how they want
Put on, my niggas, I wanna put on, my niggas
I'ma put on my niggas, I'ma put on my niggas

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Tonight’s the night, tonight’s the night
I'ma buy a hundred bottles, we gon' ball out
All my ladies fill it up, yeah, we in this bitch
I put my niggas on we gon' win this bitch

[Verse 3: Compton Menace]
Look, now look, my niggas in the ground, I still talk to
Thinkin' ‘bout the day they left, I gotta squawk too
Real shit when your body on that ground
You need some help and ain’t nobody else around
Two blessings in my life, my son and my daughter
I’m analysin' everythin' that I ever taught ‘em
A lot of shit done changed since I was brought up
Thinkin' about them fucked up days when I was caught up
Look, now everybody on that same old shit
Keepin' up with the Joneses, that’s the same old flick
Talkin' about the classic, got it but never had it
Pullin' up in that Jag’, nigga, can’t even gas it
I stack it up and I gotta keep it
And everyday I’m on the hustle, yeah, I'm never sleepin'
And everybody tryna get a million
But it’s hard when you’re one-in-a-million

[Hook: Chris Brown]
They wanna know what I’m doin', doin', yeah
Why I’m so addicted to the street life
And my mama sayin', nigga, I ain’t livin' right
‘Cause all my niggas down to ride
I’m tryna put on my niggas that’s been down from day one
I'ma try to put on my all niggas, so they can live how they want
Put on, my niggas, I wanna put on, my niggas
I'ma put on my niggas, I'ma put on my niggas

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Tonight’s the night, tonight’s the night
I'ma buy a hundred bottles, we gon' ball out
All my ladies fill it up, yeah, we in this bitch
I put my niggas on we gon' win this bitch

[Outro: Chris Brown]
They wanna know what I’m doing, doing
Put on, put on, put on, put on
‘Cause all my niggas down to ride
I’m tryna put on my niggas, I'ma try to put on so they can live how they want
Put on, my niggas, I'ma put on my niggas, I'ma put on my niggas
Tonight’s the night, tonight’s the night
I'ma buy a hundred bottles, we gon' ball out
All my ladies fill it up, yeah, we in this bitch
I put my niggas on we gon' win this bitch
