Imma be that Nigga

She know I cut them checks
She see I cash it out
Imma be her future
I'm gon put her on
U know I got the juice

[Hook: K Camp/Chris Brown]
You can't hit phone line cuz she occupied
No you can not come see her cuz she occupied
She been creeping with me better not ask her why
No time for that Nigga cuz she occupied

[Verse: Chris Brown]
Diamond chokers all up on me
They see I flooded the chains
Look at the midnight edition
Yeah I got it all on the range
Look at the toys that I'm pushing
She gon' be lost in the tank
All this cash, Yeah
She fell in love with the rain
Feed my hood yeah
Yeah I be that Peter Pan Nigga
Tell ya nigga when I get to ya
Ima keep it on the trigger
She keep coming for a reload
Ima give it like it's ammo
Beat that body like an arsenal
She gon get it at the top floor

[Verse: K Camp]
You ain't fucking with loser
Got you fucking up some pesos
She got fees aye, Shaking that ass for a G
Stack in trash bags but she ain't getting shit for free
You ain't fucking with a loser
Have you fucking up some pesos
Introduce to me to ya bestfriend
I'm feeling her vibes too
We can do it in the bedroom
I met her in a house party
Look at her body she sexy
Puerto Rican name is Zoe
She said her nigga was lazy
Now She keep calling me zaddy
And she got other Niggas pissed off
Cause I got convos cut off
