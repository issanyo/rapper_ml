[Verse 1]
The memories we shared could last a man a lifetime
It's like truth or dare when you're there, no
And I'll admit that I'm scared to lose you to another guy
But it's up to you to decide who to love

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight I'mma break my promise
I know I said I'll set you free
But baby you told me to be honest
Girl I need you here with me

[Chorus]
So we can do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again

[Verse 2]
A whole life time would not be enough
Cause I wanna love you baby over and over
And girl each time I see you shed a tear
I wanna wipe 'em all up with my kisses and make you smile from ear to ear

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight I'mma break my promise
I know I said I'll set you free
But baby you told me to be honest
Girl I need you here with me

[Chorus]
So we can do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again

[Bridge]
Girl what are you running from? I'm willing just to give you everything you want
Girl you are always number one I'm saying cause I know you're more than wonderful
And my heart and your heart are as one
And this love will never change, you and me, forever

[Chorus]
So we can do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
