[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yeah, girl, it's late at night and I'm driving, over to your crib for some action
And I just can’t wait to put it down, I just wanna work you out, I'm pulling up in your driveway
Could you keep the door unlocked? I'm coming in, girl, a nigga going up the stairs into the bedroom
A bubble bath, rose petals on the floor, we gon' do it all night, we gon' do it all night

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
So baby, can we play a little game?
Girl, your body on mine, up and down
Just make me work for it, work for it, baby
I'ma give you the business and girl, you gon' get when I start really using my tongue, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah girl, whenever I'm in your city, you know I'ma blow 'bout fifty and I'ma fuck the city up
I'ma give my love to you, you, I'ma fuck the city up
I'm coming over, babe, over over, babe and I'ma fuck the city up
I'm hella paid, I'm hella paid, so I'ma fuck the city up

[Verse 2: Tank]
Girl, I been thinking 'bout you all night, how we hit them streets and tore it up 'til daylight
Yeah, with the top down spinning, couldn't wait to get in and fuck it up, fuck it up
This DMV'll drive ya crazy, all up the stadium, tryna find a lady
Yeah I gave a couple racks to a ten and every time I'm in the city, we gon' get it in

[Pre-Chorus: Tank]
So baby, can we play a little game?
Girl, your body on mine, up and down
Just make me work for it, work for it, baby
I'ma give you the business and girl, you gon' get when I start really using my tongue, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah girl, whenever I'm in your city, you know I'ma blow 'bout fifty and I'ma fuck the city up
I'ma give my love to you, you, I'ma fuck the city up
I'm coming over, babe, over over, babe and I'ma fuck the city up
I'm hella paid, I'm hella paid, so I'ma fuck the city up

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
The night life rough, I fuck the city up
Ride this bitch all night, tell her giddy up
Champagne, some new drinks, some new bucks
But life’s too bright, thank my jeweller
This is the epitome of jealousy
When niggas expect me to strike out, like a felony
It’s not my intention to lash out, but you tellin' me
A nigga that he never be one of the
The greatest
Bitch, you hatin' 'cause a nigga made it
When I was cuttin' records in my fuckin' basement
A lil nigga couldn't get a placement
But like a spaceship I'm outta here and outta fear
You bring the uh and I buy the beer
Lookin' at my chain, it's like a chandelier
But these diamonds here and these diamonds real

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
So baby, can we play a little game?
Girl, your body on mine, up and down
Just make me work for it, work for it, baby
I'ma give you the business and girl, you gon' get when I start really using my tongue, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah girl, whenever I'm in your city, you know I'ma blow 'bout fifty and I'ma fuck the city up
I'ma give my love to you, you, I'ma fuck the city up
I'm coming over, babe, over over, babe and I'ma fuck the city up
I'm hella paid, I'm hella paid, so I'ma fuck the city up
