[Verse 1]
How could I fall, fall for you?
When I've had it all from you
Before I been ready, it's on the road, it's now or never
The hottest thing since me, yeah
But I may say, I, girl, you already know
You'll be emotional 'cause I'm only yours
Please see the gang's involved
There ain't no in and outs

[Pre-Chorus]
Only believin' now
'Cause you said you loved someone
And I felt dead wrong
'Cause I been that one
And I said I'd hold you down
So cry here right now
Go ahead and look at you
Let it out

[Chorus]
You're still gone
Still you're gone
Let me know if he cut you off
See you around, adios
I know that I'm dead wrong
