[Verse 1]
Baby, close your eyes and just
Take my hand and put your trust in my heart
I'll show you things you never seen before
Girl, the world is full of hearts
But they never been this far
And galaxies calling on you and me, just for one night, girl, that's right

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on tight, don't let go
If you don't take the chance you'll never know
Moving faster now
Driving at the speed of light, the speed of sound

[Chorus]
Go away, oh, you'll be riding on the stars tonight
Go away, oh, girl, we gon' get lost tonight
Don't you wanna go to the moon with me?
Ooh girl, I know you wanna go riding on the stars tonight

[Verse 2]
I confess my love for you
As we stick a flag up on the moon
Baby, I can honestly say
I can stay up here forever and a day

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on tight, don't let go
If you don't take the chance you'll never know
Moving faster now
Driving at the speed of light, the speed of sound

[Chorus]
Go away, oh, you'll be riding on the stars tonight
Go away, oh, girl, we gon' get lost tonight
Don't you wanna go to the moon with me?
Ooh girl, I know you wanna go riding on the stars tonight

[Bridge]
I wanna fly away from here
But if you get lonely, we can fly away, away
All you got to do is hold me
We can go today, today

[Chorus]
Go away, oh, you'll be riding on the stars tonight
Go away, oh, girl, we gon' get lost tonight
Don't you wanna go to the moon with me?
Ooh girl, I know you wanna go riding on the stars tonight
