[Verse 1]
She say she ready to go to my bed
I tell her all the things, I wanna do to her body
Baby let me take my time , ‘cause
All I want is you, licking on your pussy I’m loving’ it
With my body on you

[Chorus]
On a empty stomach, eat it like its dinner time
Dinner time, eat it like its dinner time
Dinner time, eat it like its dinner time
Dinner time, eat it like its dinner time
Dinner time
