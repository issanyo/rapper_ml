[Intro]
Oh woah, girl, woah, girl, oh woah
Oh baby, you got me

[Verse 1]
Shaking like 9/11, riding this roller-coaster
Rocking like heavy metal, you thinking I'm fucking
But baby girl when I'm finished you can't even
Come round two, you need a minute
Sing it to her when I kiss it, I got her dripping
Complaining to me saying that a nigga be tripping
But she be cheating and fucking with other niggas
But I be feeling like the only one when I'm with her

[Chorus]
Hennessy mixed in with Patron, yeah yeah
I'ma feel that shit in the morning, yeah
I know I need to leave you alone, yeah yeah
But you keep coming around cause you ready to party
And it's a damn shame I feel in love
With a girl that's already wifed up
Hennessy mixed in with Patron, yeah yeah
I'ma feel that shit in the morning, yeah
Damn, why the hell did I catch feelings?
Everything ain't always what it seems
Cause you was the girl I thought I saw in my dreams
Now I know how it feels to be the side piece

[Verse 2]
Let me getting on your level, I'ma take your girl to the crib
I know I'm petty, but boy I know she ready, baby girl you be flexing
I ain't the only nigga in your phone you be texting
She ain't the type that'll hold me down if I arrested
She the type to fuck the enemy, disrespectful
Still ain't learned my lesson
Keep a nigga feeling like the pussy is a blessing
Aw here we go again

[Chorus]
Hennessy mixed in with Patron, yeah yeah
I'ma feel that shit in the morning, yeah
I know I need to leave you alone, yeah
But you keep coming around cause you ready to party
And it's a damn shame I feel in love
With a girl that's already wifed up
Hennessy mixed in with Patron, yeah yeah
I'ma feel that shit in the morning, yeah
Damn, why the hell did I catch feelings?
Everything ain't always what it seems
Cause you was the girl I thought I saw in my dreams
Now I know how it feels to be the side piece

[Bridge]
Can't even look in your eyes, playing both sides
Shoulda told me you had a man but I know why you lied
You think that I wouldn't understand
Cause I'm dying trying not to use my head, getting me fucked up yeah

[Chorus]
Hennessy mixed in with Patron, yeah yeah
I'ma feel that shit in the morning, yeah
I know I need to leave you alone, yeah
But you keep coming around cause you ready to party
And it's a damn shame I fell in love
With a girl that's already wifed up
Hennessy mixed in with Patron, yeah yeah
I'ma feel that shit in the morning, yeah
Damn, why the hell did I catch feelings?
Everything ain't always what it seems
Cause you was the girl I thought I saw in my dreams
Now I know how it feels to be the side piece
