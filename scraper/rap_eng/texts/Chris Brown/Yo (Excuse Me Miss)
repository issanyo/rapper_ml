[Verse 1]
Yo, tell me fellas have you seen her, seen her? It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick that a youngin' never seen before
I say yo, tell the girls I wanna meet her, meet her, on second thought that ain't the way to go
I gotta give her game proper, spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her
Or should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time, she's out the door
I gotta go for mine, I think I'll say

[Chorus]
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I love to keep you here with me, oh baby

[Verse 2]
Now shawty grab hold of my hand and let's pretend the floor is ours
You say you don't really dance, don't worry 'bout it, we just 1 2 step, 1-2 step
Now if the music is moving too fast, too fast, grab my hand a little tighter, tighter
Don't be afraid to move a little closer, girl there's something about you that makes me wanna say

[Chorus]
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I love to keep you here with me, oh baby
I think I say
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I love to keep you here with me, oh baby

[Bridge]
I wanna be where you are, ain't nothing wrong with dancin
Baby it's so romantic, baby I can be in your heart
So many things I wanna tell you
I think that I should start by saying

[Chorus]
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
I gotta give her game proper, spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her
I know you tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I love to keep you here with me, oh baby

[Outro]
Now everybody just clap your hands like this, like this, just clap your hands like this, woah like this
And if your shorty in the house tonight, just grab her by the hand homie
Make her understand y'all was made to dance like this, like this, y'all was made to bounce like this, woah like this
Just let her know she was made for you and you want to do everything she want to man
