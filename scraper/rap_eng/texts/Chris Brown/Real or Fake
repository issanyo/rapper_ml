[Verse 1]
Now that you're here, baby
(Now that you're here)
I don't ever want, don't ever want to be without you
(I don't wanna be without you)
No, babe
(I can barely breathe without you)
And I know that it's clear, baby
(Know that it's clear)
'Cause I get that feeling I only get when I'm around you
(Only with you, that's how I know that it's real)
Nobody else, that's why I know it's real
That's how I know we gon' make it
Can turn my back 'cause you my baby
Sometimes I admit I do get hurt
But the question I ask then is
Do I really love you? (Yes)
Do I think our love is gonna pass the test? (Yes)
And honestly, I do
I do

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things last forever
But we know that's not always true
Just how I will always be here for you, you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I got a bag full of goodies, goodies
(I got a bag, baby)
And I can't feel my face, yeah
Is it real or fake?
Real or fake? Real or fake?
Oh, this love thing, yeah, yeah (Haha)
And you don't know what you be doing to me
Girl, your love's got me high
Is it real or fake?
This love thing
Baby, I just wanna hold you
Wanna hold you, kiss you, and squeeze you
Is it real or fake?
Your booty, this love thing
And baby, girl, I need you
I need you, I need you
Haha, and I don't wanna wait
For this love thing

[Verse 2]
Baby, I just wanna hold you
Put all of my loving all on ya
Let me show you how it really is
(Baby, let me show you)
This love thing
(Let me show you)
And boy, you know I'm repping Houston
So baby, you know I can turn up on ya
Show you how real this can really get
This love thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things last forever
But we know that's not always true
Just how I will always be here for you, you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I got a bag full of goodies, goodies
(I got a bag, baby)
And I can't feel my face, yeah, oh, oh
Is it real or fake?
Oh, this love thing, yeah, yeah (Haha)
And you don't know what you be doing to me
Girl, your love's got me high

Wanna hold you, kiss you, and squeeze you
