[Intro: Sevyn]
I want you to, love me
Like you've never loved nobody else

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I don't know if it's your scent or your kiss, but I girl, I love it
And time after time, you give me one of the greatest gifts, I want you to

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
I want you to love me
Like you never loved nobody else
And I want you to touch me, touch me, I just want you to feel it, girl
Like when you're touching yourself, yeah baby

[Verse 2: Sevyn & Chris Brown]
So baby, come over, I'm on my way girl
If you take your time, you can love me right, can I love ya? Uh-huh, take ya time, girl
If you want me to slow it down, I do, will you? I will, will you? I will
I'm biting on the pillow, trying not to make a sound
Girl, it's okay cause I want you to feel me, yeah, oh
Cause you're daddy's girl, I'mma show you how to love, show you how to love me, girl
So lay down right there, so you can hold my head
While I'm kissing on your thighs, girl, I just need it one more time

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
I want you to love me, I want you baby
Like you never loved nobody else, can you do me girl?
And I want you to touch me, touch
Like when you're touching on yourself, like when you're touching yourself

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
And as I look into your eyes, your body screams for my love
No fear, just me
And as you feel me inside, my passion fits like a glove
No more fear, just you and me

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
I want you to love me
Like you never loved nobody else
And I want you to touch me
Like when you're touching yourself
