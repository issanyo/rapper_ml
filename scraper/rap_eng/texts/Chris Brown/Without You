[Intro]
If you had a choice then what would you choose to do?

[Chorus]
I could live without money, I could live without the fame
And if every day was sunny, I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to Heaven, I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living 'cause you're the one I couldn't live without

[Verse 1]
If I couldn't blink would I still be able to see you?
I couldn't imagine, oh
Without arms could I reach?
No way could I ever hold you, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I need these things like I need you
If you had a choice, what would you choose?

[Chorus]
I could live without money, I could live without the fame
And if every day was sunny, I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to Heaven, I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living 'cause you're the one I couldn't live without

[Verse 2]
If I couldn't dream would I believe that there could be a you and me?
And if I couldn't sing, would you be able to hear my melody?
I know that something's wrong and I'm afraid that you're moving on
How can I fly when you're my wings?

[Pre-Chorus]
I need these things like I need you
If you had a choice, what would you choose?

[Chorus]
I could live without money, I could live without the fame
And if every day was sunny, I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to Heaven, I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living 'cause you're the one I couldn't live without

[Bridge]
You can take it all from me and it wouldn't mean anything
Turn the whole world against me as long as you don't leave
It's getting hard for me to sleep, even harder for me to breathe
I'm used to life with you, tell me what I need to do

[Chorus]
I could live without money, I could live without the fame
And if every day was sunny, I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to Heaven, I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living 'cause you're the one I couldn't live without
I could live without money, I could live without the fame
And if every day was sunny, I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to Heaven, I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living 'cause you're the one I couldn't live without
