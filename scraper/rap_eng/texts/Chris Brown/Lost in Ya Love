[Intro]
Do you hear me now?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, sweet like honey dew
I love it when you come around
It's just me and you
Girl, and you

[Interlude]
Her fragrance turns me on
Her skin's so soft, oh
I just wanna hold you
All night and day
And we got all the time, girl
So come a little closer
Cause I just wanna hold you
All night and day

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinking 'bout you
All day, all night
I'm holding on tight
Baby I just can't let you go

[Chorus]
I get lost in ya love
I get wrapped in the words you say
I get lost in the love we make
I even fall hard for the games you play
Lost in your love
I get wrapped in the words you say
I get lost in the love we make
I even fall hard for the games you play

[Verse 2]
Baby, you're the truth, oh na
I wanna talk about your loving
I'm so connected to you
I want it all, I need it all from you girl
You're my only one and you know that
I hold it down cause I own that
Too much history, we go way back
It's so personal and we got that

[Interlude]
Her fragrance turns me on
Her skin's so soft, oh
I just wanna hold you
All night and day
And we got all the time, girl
So come a little closer
Cause I just wanna hold you
All night and day

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinking 'bout you
All day, all night
I'm holding on tight
Baby I just can't let you go

[Chorus]
I get lost in ya love
I get wrapped in the words you say
I get lost in the love we make
I even fall hard for the games you play
Lost in your love
I get wrapped in the words you say
I get lost in the love we make
I even fall hard for the games you play

[Bridge]
Run it back, run it back, run it back, oh
This my favourite song
And shout out to the DJ
Cause he gon' play this record all night long, all night long

[Interlude]
Her fragrance turns me on
Her skin's so soft, oh
I just wanna hold you
All night and day
And we got all the time, girl
So come a little closer
Cause I just wanna hold you
All night and day

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinking 'bout you
All day, all night
I'm holding on tight
Baby I just can't let you go

[Chorus]
I get lost in ya love
I get wrapped in the words you say
I get lost in the love we make
I even fall hard for the games you play
Lost in your love
I get wrapped in the words you say
I get lost in the love we make
I even fall hard for the games you play

[Outro]
Run it back, run it back, run it back, oh
And shout out to the DJ, all night long
