[Verse 1]
I caught a wave, you felt a way
Now you act like you don't know nobody
Quit calling your girls for advice
You know damn well they ain't got your back
I look up, down, my roof gone, you gone
I woke up, but fuck, I had to leave my shoes on
All this time was tryna get you back
But you never know

[Pre-Chorus]
I been feenin' for your love
And maybe, baby, you know
And maybe, baby, you know (you)
If you said you're really done
Baby, baby, you'd know (you)
You'd know

[Chorus]
Don't you slow me down (don't you, no)
Don't you slow me down (ayy, ooh, hey)
You won't be around (you won't be around, oh)
Don't you slow me (don't you show me)
Don't you slow me (yeah)
Baby, don't you slow me down

[Verse 2]
You got me in my feelings, I felt a way
How she gon' act like she don't know nobody?
She prolly got a new man in her life
Well fuck that nigga
I could care less what he do for you, babe
'Cause everything that I do is amazing
Baby, we doing our own thing
Yeah, together, together, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I been feenin' for your love
And maybe, baby, you know (you know)
And maybe, baby, you know (you know)
If you said you're really done
Baby, baby, you'd know (you)
You'd know

[Chorus]
Don't you slow me down (don't you slow me down, oh)
Don't you slow me down (hey)
You won't be around (and you won't be around, round, round, round)
Don't you slow me (don't you slow me)
Don't you slow me (don't you slow me)
Baby, don't you slow me down (down)
