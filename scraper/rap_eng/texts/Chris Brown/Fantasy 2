[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It's your fantasy and you got, you got me
Wanting to do it, I'm 'bout to prove it
Baby I want to know can you love me? You know I'd do anything girl
I don't wanna waste your time, I'll put my heart on the line for you

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
It's the middle of the night, we in the middle of life baby
So let your hair down, nobody's around, we're making love, just listen
Girl, right now I feel you, can you hold me closer baby?
This shit right here, if your looks could kill, baby go crazy, I'm gon' control it

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I love the way you throw it, I love the way you throw it

Bring that ass right here, bring that ass right here

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Let me tell you what I wanna do, I wanna lick lick lick you from your head to your toes and have you begging all night for mercy
Looking like a tall glass full of water in a 100 degrees, you got a nigga so thirsty
Let me taste that, let me chase that, lay back, way back, like Diddy baby take that
Get you wetter than the great lakes, take a vacay to place where your booty you can shake that
And erase, Henny getting all the stress in your mind knowing you're my one and only
Take off everything, but you boots, saddle up, ride it like a pony
Girl, you, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what's your fantasy, Luda

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It's your fantasy and you got, you got me
Wanting to do it, I'm 'bout to prove it
Baby I want to know can you love me? You know I'd do anything girl
I don't wanna waste your time, I'll put my heart on the line for you
