[Intro]
Put your ass up on that pole, put your ass up on that pole
Put your ass up on that pole, put your ass up on that pole
Put your ass up on that pole, put your ass up on that pole
Put your ass up on that pole, put your ass up on that pole

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Girl, you wanna play with me, baby
Money ain't a thing 'cause I got paper
I'm looking at your body
You about to get exactly what you came for
Now I can throw it up, throw it up, break it down, down, down
Even if it ain't loud she gets me aroused
Slow it up, slow it up, slow it down
You the shit, you the shit
Go 'head play with it, baby
'Cause I'ma keep my hands to myself and my back on the wall
Gon' play with it, baby
I know you don't give a fuck 'cause you gon' get your money up

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I, I, I get your ass up on that pole
Get this money in my hand
I, I, I all this money dripping on you
Like paint from a Mona Lisa
Aha, aha
Drop to the floor bitch, aha, aha
All this money dripping on you
Like paint from a Mona Lisa

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
I fucked with my first bitch, I upgrade my second broad
Corporate my credit card, vintage out my fuckin' watch
Vintage out my fuckin' cars, no T-Bone just fuckin' yacht
Your new bitch, my old bitch, you can have the hoe 'cause she talk a lot
Now get your ass up on this pole, you can get this money
Now I got them carats, I got all them Playboy bunnies
Come shake it for daddy, I'm throwin' them hunnids
Racks on top of racks and Maybachs look like hunnids

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
And they ass big as some mountain, put my drink on it, she cold
My zipper down but my money up, better get your ass up on that pole
Two more shots then I'm out, blacka, blacka then I reload
Got it, might earn 20 more, get yo ass up on that pole
Damn, look at Lakeisha gettin' that money just like a zesta
All of these bunnies bunnies, hoppin' and poppin'
You fightin' to get up in my two seater
My chain, 6 rings, bitch, I'm in the motherfuckin' game

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I, I, I get your ass up on that pole
Get this money in my hand
I, I, I all this money dripping on you
Like paint from a Mona Lisa
Aha, aha
Drop to the floor bitch, aha, aha
All this money dripping on you
Like paint from a Mona Lisa

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
I don't make it rain
Nigga, I make it monsoon like a tidal wave
Me taking 23 shots, that's a MJ
I mean a fadeaway, we 'bout to fadeaway
She said she like my pants, I think she like my pockets
Bitch, I'm in the buildin' countin' millions, you should try it
Yeah, what d'you mean? She tried to kiss me, I said stop it
Put that money in the face, then she get that pussy poppin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I, I, I get your ass up on that pole
Get this money in my hand
I, I, I all this money dripping on you
Like paint from a Mona Lisa
Aha, aha
Drop to the floor bitch, aha, aha
All this money dripping on you
Like paint from a Mona Lisa
