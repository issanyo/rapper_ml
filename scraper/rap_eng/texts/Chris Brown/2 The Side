[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, babe, yeah
I know what you need, babe

[Verse 1]
Here we are again
All this runnin’ through my head like I know what you need right
Is what you ‘bout to get
We can do this right now, no acting shy now
Fuck it, I don’t care
I know I want it, girl, you know you want it, girl
Take it to the head
Ain't gotta put 'em down, down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
We can turn this backseat to a bed
We can turn this backseat to a bed
Fog up all the windows, heating up
Fog up all the windows, heating up
We don’t even have to get undressed
‘Cause we ain’t, trying to make love, yeah

[Chorus]
And I’m gon’ keep my shirt on
You can keep your heels on
Baby, don’t take them panties off
Just pull ‘em to the side, to the side, to the side (baby)
You on me and me on you
So we don’t need, we don’t need a bedroom
Don’t take them panties off
Just pull ‘em to the side, to the side, side

[Verse 2]
You gon’ get that quick shit
With that good shit, that dick got you screamin’
That rough type, what you like
My Mars, all in your Venus
Baby, I'ma change your life
And do it all in just one night
We gon’ get explicit
Try somethin' different
Legs on my shoulders
All kind of positions
Girl, I do the shit you like
I’ma do the shit you like, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
We can turn this backseat to a bed
We can turn this backseat, baby
Fog up all the windows, heating up (woah)
You don’t even have to get undressed
We don’t have to get undressed
Put it up there, leave it right there
Baby girl, leave all your clothes on

[Chorus]
And I’m gon’ keep my shirt on (we could get naked)
You can keep your heels on (you can keep ‘em on)
Baby, don’t take them panties off (girl)
Just pull ‘em to the side, to the side, to the side (pull ‘em, woah)
You on me and me on you (me, me)
So we don’t need, we don’t need a bedroom (no bed, no bed)
Please don’t take your panties off
Just pull ‘em to the side, to the side, to the side (pull ‘em baby)

[Verse 3]
I know you want it, baby
‘Cause your body’s been calling, baby
Let's not waste any time, we ain’t got all night
I’ma go all in, baby
I know you want it, baby
Your body’s been calling me
"Like let's get on top of me and drive me crazy"
Even if it takes all night
I’ma gonna do you, promise

[Chorus]
And I’m gon’ keep my shirt on (oh, keep it on, keep it on)
You can keep your heels on (heels, yeah)
You don't gotta take them panties off
Just pull ‘em to the side, to the side, to the side (side)
You on me, and me on you (me on you)
So we don’t need, we don’t need a bedroom (we don’t need a bed)
Keep your panties on
Just pull ‘em to the side, tto the side, side (just pull ‘em to the side)

[Outro]
Oh, babe
Just pull ‘em to the side
Oh, babe
I said wassup, babe
Just pull ‘em to the side
Oh-oh-oh
We don’t need, we don’t need a bedroom
Just pull ‘em to the side, side
Oh, oh, oh, babe, yeah
Your panties, just pull ‘em to the side
