[Intro: French Montana]
JLo
Feel it getting closer
Stirring like I'm supposed to
To stop me, no sir (No sir, haa!)
Haters getting closer
Stirring like I'm supposed to
To stop me, no sir (No sir, ayy)

[Verse 1: French Montana]
When you make it, you were chosen (You were chosen)
Same time, you in trouble (You in trouble)
Mama told me stay out of that corner (Out that corner)
Thank God that we made it out that corner (Out that corner)
Going crazy, now them suicide doors (Wraith boys)
IRS watching your money on the Forbes (On the Forbes)
Shorty on me got a bag (Got a bag)
Haters wanna see me in a body bag (Body bag)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & French Montana]
My head's killing me (Oh), I'm losing sleep
And I'm waking up tired of it all (Sing, oh)
Early in the morning and it's starting already
Why my name always involved?
I try to get rid of the baggage
Fake friends I call them "has-been"
Yeah, they lying on stuff
And it's okay if they don't show me love, no

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & French Montana]
They want me to lie down (Oh)
They want me to crawl (Sing)
They want me to cry now (Ooh)
But I'm never falling off (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Chris Brown & French Montana]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody (Brap! Oh)
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me (Sing, yeah)
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders? (Brap!)
Get off of me, (Brap!), get off of me (Brap!)
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
'Cause in the end, I'm still the same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)
I'm just the same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Tell me what I gotta do
I'm tryna make it clear to you
Not dealing with the attitude
I'm tired of tryna make you see that I'm still me
Switched up my longitude and latitude
You're in my way, you better move
'Cause I'm on the same grind
No, I never changed, I'm
Loving everyday
I know that I'm the same Jenny from around the way, ah

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
They want me to lie down
They want me to crawl
They want me to cry now
But I'm never falling off

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Chris Brown]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody (Brap!)
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders? (Brap!)
Get off of me, (Brap!), get off of me (Brap!)
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
'Cause in the end, I'm still the same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)
I'm just the same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez]
I'ma keep on growing, keep on shining
Just wanna do me
I had to thank God 'cause he chose me
I'm still the same girl

[Verse 4: French Montana]
When I was dead broke there was nobody (Nobody)
My back to the walls, nobody (Nobody)
Still the same old nigga (Nigga)
Thirty new cars, thirty chains, oh nigga
Been real (Been real), count money (Count money)
Get it hot (Get it hot), oh la la
Been real (Been real), count money (Count money)
Get it hot (Get it hot), oh la la

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Chris Brown]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me (Off of me)
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody (Brap!)
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders? (Brap! World on my)
Get off of me, (Brap! Off of me), get off of me (Brap!)
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody (I don't owe nobody)
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
(Ow!)
