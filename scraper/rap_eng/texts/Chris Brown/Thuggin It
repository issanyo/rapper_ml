[Intro: Joe Moses]
Like JM, CB
Shit, bitch, we all we need, hah (DJ Official)
I mean like, for real for real

[Verse 1: Joe Moses]
Took a trip to my enemies to fuck that (what?)
And every time I went raw, I made her fuck back (yeah)
Got a baby by the same nigga hatin' on me (hatin' on me)
Fresh out, you the only one was waitin' on me (yeah)
Did 4, came home, you never changed on me (changed)
And every now and then I heard she did a lame on me (haha)
Copped the 'rari like Tyga, then fucked Kylie (fucked Kylie)
And every time I hit the city, shit, I ride it (shit, I ride it)
Made niggas only 'posed to fuck with made hoes (hoes)
I give a shoutout to my exes, how they made hoes (what?)
World Star, Playhouse, I done slay hoes (I done slay hoes)
I seen a few with my niggas, how the game goes
Lord knows they get wet when the time right (time right)
Tom Ford, Time Square, what a good night
Double R Rolex, for the good price (price)
And when her ass do the splits, what a good sight (JM)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Lemme see you rock that body back and forth, yeah
You gon' get this dick, I'ma give you what you asking for
I heard she got that good pussy, I'ma go down, I'ma eat that
Good pussy, I'ma make that kitty cry
Baby, I ain't tryna hurt your body
I just wanna see you work your body
Down up, down up
Thuggin' it

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I take my bitches to the trap house
She smoke weed, hella tatted, with her ass out
This codeine 'bout to make a nigga black out
Red guts in the Wraith, I'm finna mash out
Blood, the nerve of these niggas, they ain't from my set
Could give a fuck 'bout a hater, they don't write my checks
It's hard to make a decision, got bitches on top of bitches
Know I be flippin' them pigeons, give her the D like it's Michigan
Pussy poppin', she drop it down and she land on the dick
I'm Steph Curry with your bitch and I'll be damned if I miss
All the molly in my cup, got me up, babe
I'm turnin' up in this place tonight
We on, babe, on, babe
You know you can't play a player
Let's party, party
Baby, show you right

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Lemme see you rock that body back and forth, yeah
You gon' get this dick, I'ma give you what you asking for
I heard she got that good pussy, I'ma go down, I'ma eat that
Good pussy, I'ma make that kitty cry
Baby, I ain't tryna hurt your body
I just wanna see you work your body
Down up, down up
Thuggin' it
Down up, down up
Thuggin' it
Down up, down up
Thuggin' it
