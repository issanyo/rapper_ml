[Verse 1]
17 tight jeans and she bout it, white beater T, pretty teeth, yeah she got 'em
Her body command your attention, she keeps it so gutta man
Can I take you out? I'll pay for it, girl I got enough, so enjoy it
I'm hoping that your momma don't mind cause girl I gotta make you mine
Oh, girl give me a chance I'mma take it
Oh, yeah I know I'm young but I'll take it, I just gotta know, yeah

[Chorus]
Is this love?
Because I gotta know, is this real?
Girl I gotta know
Is it you taking over my heart?
If it's love
Then all my girls and them I gotta give them up
My playing days is over I gotta hang it up
I gotta know, I gotta know, yeah, is this love?

[Verse 2]
If she gotta man I don't care because I need her, I gotta girl but if she want I'mma leave her
She can be the girl that I'm putting on, she keep it so gutta man
I'mma be the nigga that'll change her
Make that other dude like a stranger, I just gotta know, tell me

[Chorus]
Is this love?
Because I gotta know, is this real?
Girl I gotta know
Is it you taking over my heart?
If it's love
Then all my girls and them I gotta give them up
My playing days is over I gotta hang it up
I gotta know, I gotta know, yeah, is this love?

[Bridge]
I ain't been doing much sleeping, just daydreaming
Cause she's all up in my head and I can't take it
I ain't never, ever felt like this, I gotta know, I gotta know
Is this how love really is?

[Chorus]
Is this love?
Because I gotta know, is this real?
Girl I gotta know
Is it you taking over my heart?
If it's love
Then all my girls and them I gotta give them up
My playing days is over I gotta hang it up
I gotta know, I gotta know, yeah, is this love?
Is this love?
Because I gotta know, is this real?
Girl I gotta know
Is it you taking over my heart?
If it's love
Then all my girls and them I gotta give them up
My playing days is over I gotta hang it up
I gotta know, I gotta know, yeah, is this love?
