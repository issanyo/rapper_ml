It’s your face
And you got, you got me
You wanted to do it
I’m bout to prove it
Baby you love
Can you love me?
You know I’d do anything yeah
The time I put my heart on the line
For you

It’s the middle of the night
We in the middle of laying baby
So let your hair down your back if you want
Make love
Girl make love feel you
Hold me close to your body
You stay right here
You can watch the kid
Baby go crazy
I’m bout to prove it
I love the way you do it
I love the way you make love
I love the way you do it
I love the way you on it
And it is right here
And it is right here
Baby you so amazing
Going crazy I’ll prove it all
For you what you wanna do
Girl this a dream but
You’re not asleep
Can I make it misery
Cause it shows your face
