[Verse 1]
Baby why I ain't gotta be the boss
I'm just fine
'Cause anytime I want, I'mma get mine
When I put my tongue in your pantie line
Eat that like breakfast
Leave his ass in the past
He keep bringing my name up
Cos you starting to change up

[Pre-Chorus]
It's morning time
Wrapped up in my covers
For the night time
Cos he couldn't fuck you out your right mind (oh)
Ain't no competition let's be serious
I'm the best, period (ooh yeah, no shit)

[Chorus]
Ain't my, ain't my, ain't my, ain't my, ain't my girl (noo)
She ain't my, ain't my, ain't my
No matter...
