[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
The force of gravity is grabbing me tonight
So I'm feeling there's no ceiling only sky-y-y
When you look me in the eye

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
When you're high my fears are fading
Your atmosphere, you're making me clear
Do or die, but I'll be breathing
As long as you're here
As long as you're here

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't even care if I'm falling down
I won't hit the ground, I got you
We in the air like a fucking cloud
While I'm safe and sound, here with you
Baby, you're like a parachute, parachute
Your love is always coming through, coming through
So I don't care if I'm falling down, I won't hit the ground
You're my, you're my parachute

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Take me up so high, so I can feel the sky
Your presence is a present tonight
And girl, you make me believe I can fly

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Seven Streeter]
When you're high my fears are fading (yeah)
Your atmosphere, you're making me clear
Do or die, but I'll be breathing
In my feelings is how I'm feeling
Crazy about you

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
I don't even care if I'm falling down
I won't hit the ground, (baby) I got you
We in the air like a fucking cloud
While I'm safe and sound here with you
Baby, you're like a parachute, parachute
Your love is always coming through, coming through
So I don't care if I'm falling down, I won't hit the ground
You're my, you're my parachute

[Verse 3: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
No, it ain't fair
You should be here, baby right here
The way you love me, it ain't fair
No, oh-oh
You're my, you're my parachute
I fell in love in a party
My hands all over her body
Follow wherever she go
Bad man take you down low
And you put the edge on me, baby
Whine when you sexin' me crazy
I love her wherever she go
Bad man take you down low

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't even care if I'm falling down
I won't hit the ground, I got you
We in the air like a fucking cloud
While I'm safe and sound here with you
Baby, you're like a parachute, parachute
Your love is always coming through, coming through
So I don't care if I'm falling down, I won't hit the ground
You're my, you're my parachute
