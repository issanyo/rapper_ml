[Chorus: Chris Brown]
The same old hood shit early in the morning
Smoke that same old good shit, I’m all about my paper
Don't be on that bullshit, the world is full of colors but but but
All I see is red
But but, all I see is red
But but, all I see is red
But but, all I see is red
The world is full of colors but all I see is red

[Verse 1: Kid Red]
I’m 'bout my paper, 'bout my bread
Pat that cake, I’m the baker’s man
You niggas is shook, can’t shake my hand
I take my time, y'all take a stand
And I take a bitch, I’ll break a bitch
I save my money, I don’t save no bitch
We a crew with sharks in a tank of fish
Yeah, you lookin' at a star, hoe, make a wish
Comin' straight up off the block like Jadakiss
Nah honey, I ain’t kiddin', I don’t play for shit
When I pull up in that red 'rari
Make that nigga have to run up in your house party, nigga

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Red]
I’m 'bout my paper so we on that bullshit
A nigga get to talkin', we gon' empty that full clip
Hoes always wonderin' what I’m doin'
Gettin' me some money. bitch, pop that pussy

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
The same old hood shit early in the morning
Smoke that same old good shit, I’m all about my paper
Don't be on that bullshit, the world is full of colors but but but
All I see is red
But but, all I see is red
But but, all I see is red
But but, all I see is red
The world is full of colors but all I see is red

[Verse 2: Kid Red]
Two blunts and a molly, three shots to get me started
Every mornin' is a party, every night is a orgy
Redhead kin with my black on white bonkers
Red and white diamonds in my black and red 'rari
Private jet landin', 30 bottles up in mansion
Got mast around my wrist, I’ll throw a marrow at the dancer
A player 'til I die, freak-show as usual
Yeah, I let 'em strippers play, pop that at my funeral
Ready for the turn up, big blunt burners
OHB the cream makers 'cause we all earners
Fuck her then I’m gone, she hit the dot so it’s legal
On her face like a planet ‘cause I hunt just like the jurors, ha

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Red]
I’m 'bout my paper so we on that bullshit
A nigga get to talkin', we gon' empty that full clip
Hoes always wonderin' what I’m doin'
Gettin' me some money. bitch, pop that pussy

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
The same old hood shit early in the morning
Smoke that same old good shit, I’m all about my paper
Don't be on that bullshit, the world is full of colors but but but
All I see is red
But but, all I see is red
But but, all I see is red
But but, all I see is red
The world is full of colors but all I see is red
