[Intro]
Just go, just go
Lose control of it
Just go, just go
Party and let’s go

[Verse 1]
Play on player, play on player
All my girls, it’s Friday night and I feel alright
Play on player, play on player
The DJ’s playing my favorite song tonight so you gotta dance to it

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you to show off, get that, I know you believe in karma
Anything you give, you get it right back, so baby take a sip
I know you like that, we not leaving, this where the party at
Even if the police come, fuck that, we throwing up where I'm from

[Chorus]
We can do it girl just
Go, go, go
There you go, all in for me just
Go, go, go, all in when you with me just
Go, go, go
If you really wanna go to my crib, we can just
Go, go, go
Go baby, go baby

[Verse 2]
I see you girl, taking shot after shot
Take a little more for me girl, gimme all you got
If you need anything, if the light’s too bright we can turn ‘em down
But please turn up for me, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you to show off, get that, I know you believe in karma
Anything you give, you get it right back, so baby take a sip
I know you like that, we not leaving, this where the party at
Even if the police come, fuck that, we throwing up where I'm from

[Chorus]
We can do it girl just
Go, go, go
There you go, all in for me just
Go, go, go, all in when you with me just
Go, go, go
If you really wanna go to my crib we can just
Go, go, go
Go baby, go baby

[Verse 3]
Just go baby, where the weed at?
A whole bag of pills, but you don't need that
Sit down girl, talk to me
I wanna lay you down, I know you need a place to relax
If we get it girl, your heart gon' collapse
If we don't get it again, you might relapse
Baby, I ain't playing games
We gon' take it all the way tonight
Say lady, girl how many licks does it take 'til I get to the centre
You know babe, you know just what I'm talking 'bout
Put in your favor, baby whatever you say
So please don't turn down right now, girl I'm about to eat it

[Chorus]
We can do it girl just
Go, go, go
There you go, all in for me just
Go, go, go, all in when you with me just
Go, go, go
If you really wanna go to my crib we can just
Go, go, go
Go baby, go baby

[Outro]
Just go, baby, we can just go
All in, baby, we can just go
Baby, we can just go, we can just go, just go
We can just go party, let's go
