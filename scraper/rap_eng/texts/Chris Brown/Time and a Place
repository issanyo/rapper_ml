[Intro: Kodak Black]
Ayy Kodak, yeah, I'm fresh out, man
This that summer jam, man
Y'all slide this shit 'til school start back

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yeah, girl, I wanna be your lover, we can do this all night, right now
But first let me get a lil' drank in me
Snapple with a lil' Henny, under the hood got a big Hemmey, vibes loud
Oh yeah, babe, you gon' feel it when you vibe with me
We all on each other, from the minute you walked in the club
I ain't gotta lie to you 'cause you know it, I think I'm 'bout to fall in love
Right now, we should get ready 'cause I'm in the mood
I'm tryna do something to you, but baby, hold up

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah, champagne on the way, it's a time and a place
Baby girl, I wanna take off everything, but I gotta wait
You're gone, wanting your body
But it's a time and a place, oh girl, I gotta wait

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Look, I'm 'bout to slide on ya ass
I ain't lookin' at ya, got my eyes on the cash
Baby daddy with me, he on C class
Look, I kill the scene, dead flies on ya ass
I feel codeine in my tank
But I'ma pump 89 for the gas
Summertime niggas on the grind with the slab
Overtime nigga finna ride 'til ya crash
Baby, I ain't tryna make ya laugh
But call me butthead, got my mind on ya ass
This ain't a disguise, this a mask
This ain't a Nissan, this a Jag'
No surprise, boy, you know I'm gon' spaz
All that money gettin', boy, you know they gon' ask
I ain't finna play, put the .40 on ya ass
In a Audi thing, 240 on the dash
Your girlfriend know we got bags
Got her in the hotel, shorty gettin' smashed
It's just me and my niggas havin' a blast
Livin' fast, buyin' the things we never had
We just love stuntin', we ain't never like to brag
All us thuggin', we ain't never had a dad
I did a lot of dirt in my past
Later on the cell came, bit me in the ass
Lately I be hit the beat with the tab
Lately I been doin' shows back to back
Free Chattboy, free Cool
I'm goin' hard, I ain't goin' back to school
Bob the Builder youngin' on the corner with the tool
Swimmin' in the money, what you doin' in the pool?
Took flight, then I landed on the news
Playin' with them bands, I ain't playin' by the rules

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah, champagne on the way, it's a time and a place
Baby girl, I wanna take off everything, but I gotta wait
You're gone, wanting your body
But it's a time and a place, oh girl, I gotta wait

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Wait just for a minute, I gotta check out my tab
Fuck Uber, you can sit in my lap
When we ride the Lamborghini, just hold on 'cause I'm running every red light, baby
No breaks, all gas, it's gon' be a long night, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah, champagne on the way, it's a time and a place
Baby girl, I wanna take off everything, but I gotta wait
You're gone, wanting your body
But it's a time and a place, oh girl, I gotta wait
