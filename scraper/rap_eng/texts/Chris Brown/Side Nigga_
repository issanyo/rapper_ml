[Snippet]

'Cause anytime I want imma get mine
When I put my tongue on your panty line
Eat that like breakfast
Leave his ass in the past
He keep bringing my name up
'Cause you startin' to change up

It's morning time
Wrapped up in my covers
For the ninth time
'Cause he couldn't fuck you
Out your right mind
Ain't no competition, let's be serious
I'm the best, period

You know she
Ain't my (Ain't my)
Ain't my (Ain't my)
Ain't my Girl
She ain't my, Ain't my
Ain't my Girl

No matter what, [?]

Tossin' in my bed (my bed)
Remembering what she said (I remember)
I know she got a man at home, I don't care
I'll be Side nigga of the year
