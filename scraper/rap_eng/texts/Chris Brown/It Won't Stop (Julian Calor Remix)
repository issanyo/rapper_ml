[Verse 1: Seyvn Streeter & (Chris Brown)]
I love when we pulling up to that beach (that beach)
Sand down in my feet (yeah)
Sun down, nobody round, that's one hell of a scene
You rocking my body (body), rock rock the boat, Aaliyah (body)
Don't it sound familiar?

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
And it won't stop, no, boom, boom, ooh
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh, yeah
With every single part of me, my love for you is constantly (me, oh)
Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh
And it won't stop
And it won't stop

[Verse 2: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
Every little thing you do got me feeling some type of way
When you give me that thunder you make my summer rain
Oh-oh-oh oh, oh, oh-oh-oh oh, oh
Everyday, everyday

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
And it won't stop
And it won't stop
With every single part of me, my love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat
And it won't stop
And it won't stop
And it won't stop
