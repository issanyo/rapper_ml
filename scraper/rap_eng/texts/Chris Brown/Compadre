[Intro]
Murda on da beat so it's not nice

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
All these pills I can't hear what you sayin'
Drugs, all these drugs, yeah bitch
Goin' to the moon, beam me up
Smokin' high shit
Gas, smokin' gas, the fire shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm runnin' plays, I'm connected with the plug
Huh, olé, olé, olé, my compadre
My homies loco when they shoot you out in broad day
And ain't no easy route, cause speakin' ain't the hard way

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Olé, olé, olé, I just found out the play
Got my bitch all on his line sendin' his location
You must think you slick
Pull up with the stick
Revolver, hollow shells, so you won't find out who did it
Disappear like Houdini
Drop the top, that's a magic trick
3 Lamborghinis, you fuck niggas on that rentin' shit
Cool as shit, through with all the foolish shit
You know I got the Rugers, and the tools aswell
Get, thats a .30 clip

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
All these pills I can't hear what you sayin'
Drugs, all these drugs, yeah bitch
Goin' to the moon, beam me up
Smokin' high shit
Gas, smokin' gas, the fire shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm runnin' plays, I'm connected with the plug
Huh, olé, olé, olé, my compadre
My homies loco when they shoot you out in broad day
And ain't no easy route, cause speakin' ain't the hard way

[Verse 2: Kap G]
Wakin' up, I'm feelin' like I'm Pablo (Pablo)
I got some partners with the duffle like I'm Ralo (damu)
I got some partners who gon' pull up with them hollows
Your bitch gon' send me your location from your iPhone (aye)
Pull up in the trenches (pull up in the trenches)
Nigga, pull up with the stenches (pull up with the stenches)
I keep pulling out of them bitches (yuh)
I got the sauce and I'm drippin' (woo)
Im dripped in designer, call me Big Tymin, I'm just being honest
We got it on us, we pull up in Hondas
You don't want the drama, you talk to your Honor

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & (Kap G)]
All these pills I can't hear what you sayin' (Kap G)
Drugs, all these drugs, yeah bitch
Goin' to the moon, beam me up
Smokin' high shit
Gas, smokin' gas, the fire shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm runnin' plays, I'm connected with the plug
Huh, olé, olé, olé, my compadre
My homies loco when they shoot you out in broad day
And ain't no easy route, cause speakin' ain't the hard way
