[Verse 1]
I can't explain it, ay, ay
But its worth a shot, ay, ay
I can give you a whole lot of lovin’
All of my time, baby, ‘cause thats all I got
And theres no excuse, ay, ay
What I put you through, ay, ay
Without you, I’m losing sleep at night
So baby lets try, making’ this old love feel brand new

[Pre-Chorus]
How I feel am I going, shawty
I wanna get you, just to hold my hand
Dont let go, oh woah, oh woah
I don’t care what it takes to get right again
I just love you, ‘cause you’re my baby, yeah
Only you can save me, oh woah

[Chorus]

Todays a new day

Nothing lasts forever, so can we be together now
Oh woah, oh woah, can we be together now
Oh na na, na na

[Verse 2]

And make you feel so good, so good, so good

So I can show you how much I mean it
So can we bring this back (ooh woah)
Oh girl, I promise you

Pre-Chorus]
How I feel am I going, shawty

[Bridge]
Oh I said I, I messed up so many times
And sometimes I feel like crying, crying, crying
Let me love, its hard to find
And I never thought of running away
But I always felt like you would someday
But girl, I need you to stay

[Chorus]
I’ma get it right this time (oh, oh)
Todays a new day
I’ve figured it out, I swear
I wanna change my life, with you right now
Dont you forget, all of our good times (don’t you forget, oh)
Good times, good times (oh, oh)
Nothing lasts forever, so can we be together now

[Outro]
And now, now, now, oh
‘Cause you’re the girl for me yeah
You’re the girl for me yeah, yeah
You’re the girl for me yeah
Oh right now
