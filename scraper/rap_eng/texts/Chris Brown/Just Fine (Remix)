[Solomon Childs]
You so remarkable, you are worrying, shopping for handbags
Gucci seats in them Lambo' vans
European yorkie, your pony running the race
At the Kentucky, you could of robbed all the money
Handcuffed, golden honey
It's brazy how he treat you, but it's gon' be a long summer
We gon' fuck around and lose ya, come on

[Chris Brown]
We did everything we could do
To try to make it work (we did, we did)
Baby, you look so confused, cause it feels like
There was no way we could lose (no way, no way)
Baby, I just don't know why, I can't find
The things you need in me (I can't, I can't girl)
Baby, they know just know what to say
They trying to break us away from one another, but maybe their right for a change

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I think, God will give you someone
Much better than me, trust me
Your eyes will be O.K. it will be alright
You'll be just fine (just fine, just fine)

[Chris Brown]
I know that baby we would disagree constantly on the basic things (we did, we did)
You thought that there was someone else, all along (no way, no way)
Baby I want to decide to stay right by your side
Baby, they know just what to say
They wanna keep us away from one another
But maybe they're right for a change

[Solomon Childs]
So call me, who down for you?
Baby girl, listen, you need me, as much as I need you
Teach me, as much as I teach you
Kiss me, as much as I kiss you
The word on the streets is that we talk to each other
You represent me, when they see you
This dumb ass nigga thinking it's him
They got the glory for your people
I'm only ready for the stone love
I hope you ready for them late night, after the bar, rubs
So you can be as nasty as you want
And I'mma take you anywhere that you want

[Chorus]

[Chris Brown]
I know, baby, baby, baby can't you see that
Another fella just may be the kinda man that you need
You deserve it and I know that
I know another love has come your way, just listen to me when I say
You'll find him (you'll find him) be patient

[Chorus 2X]
