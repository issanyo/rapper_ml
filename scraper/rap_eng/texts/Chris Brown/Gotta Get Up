[Chorus]
Fuck what they saying, we do better together
Fuck what they saying, we do better together
Girl why you playing? We do better together
Girl why you playing? We do better together
Fuck what they saying, we do better together
Me and you girl, we can to it together
Fuck what they saying, we do better together
Fuck what they saying, we do better together

[Verse 1]
And everybody thinks they know what's best for you
They say I've been stressing you, maybe they're right
But you're grown now and you're way too old to be listening to what your mama say
Your homie, best friend, auntie Carla say, this is your life

[Chorus]
Fuck what they saying, we do better together
Fuck what they saying, we do better together
Girl why you playing? We do better together
Girl why you playing? We do better together
Fuck what they saying, we do better together
Me and you girl, we can to it together
Fuck what they saying, we do better together
Fuck what they saying, we do better together

[Verse 2]
Every time I turn my back, niggas be in your ear
Telling you everything you wanna hear, deep down I know you like
So get gas now but girl your tank is full of empty promises
Them niggas there gon' learn what karma is and I'm gon' watch

[Chorus]
Fuck what they saying, we do better together
Fuck what they saying, we do better together
Girl why you playing? We do better together
Girl why you playing? We do better together
Fuck what they saying, we do better together
Me and you girl, we can to it together
Fuck what they saying, we do better together
Fuck what they saying, we do better together

[Bridge]
Cause every time I see you, ain't no hesitating
Baby, baby we a deadly combination and I swear I have shit on lock
And your pretty face baby, makes me fall in love, I go insane for you
Makes me wanna do some pretty nasty things with you, oh girl, I can't even lie
