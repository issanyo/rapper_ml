[Verse 1]
Yeah, there's tension in every speck of the air
Yeah, I feel like we’re close and there's no time to spare
Oh, ooh, who’s gonna win when we’re not playing fair?
Oh

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I-I, I feel alone sometimes
I-I-I-I-I, I wanna find what’s missing
Can you still fight?
So you know what I’m feeling inside
No, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
Enough is enough, can we put out the fire?
We all gotta change for us to transpire
What will it take for us to come together?
We must face our fears and love each other

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, can you hear me, hear me?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, can you hear me, hear me?
We just need to feel the love that's spreading ‘round, 'round through the air
Like oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, can you hear me, hear me?

[Verse 2]
Tell me why? Oh
Why can’t we seem to let it go? Yeah
If we try, oh yeah, to give our all and just a little more
A little more, more

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I-I, I feel alone sometimes
I-I-I-I-I, I wanna find what’s missing
Can you still fight?
So you know what I’m feeling inside
No, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
Enough is enough, can we put out the fire? (Fire)
We all gotta change for us to transpire, woo
What will it take for us to come together now?
We must face our fears and love each other (yeah, ow!)

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, can you hear me, hear me? Oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, can you hear me, hear me? (Can you hear me? Oh)
We just need to feel the love that's spreading ‘round, 'round through the air
Like oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, can you hear me, hear me?

[Outro]
Can you, baby? Can you, baby?
Oh, oh, can you, baby?
Oh, oh, can you, baby?
Can you, baby? Can you, baby?
Oh, oh, can you, baby?
