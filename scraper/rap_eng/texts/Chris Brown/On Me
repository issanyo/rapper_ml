[Verse 1]
When you cuss me out, you don't mean that shit
I keep her looking good, my bitch clean as shit
Baby girl, I love you, I mean that shit
From the bottom of my heart, see me bleeding tears
You the type to take my charge, show up at my case
When she drive my car, she see the stars in the Wraith
She be out of line but she know her place
In the morning look at her face 'cause I don't fuck with makeup
And you know I love you
No matter, I'm right here waiting for you
It ain't 'bout the money, it ain't about the fame
It ain't 'bout the chase and it ain't about the games
You play hard to get
Baby, I just need you like you need me
Falling head over heels for you is easy
Ooh, I love your name, I hope you feel the same

[Pre-Chorus]
She said she wanna chill, well come over later (yeah)
Don't worry about us, send the driver to come get you, baby
No, you don't wanna be lonely, do me a favor (yeah)
When we making love, you better put it all on me, on me

[Chorus]
Put it on me every single time (on me)
That pussy mine, yeah (you better put it all on me)
Put it on me every single time (on me)
That pussy mine (you better put it all on me)

[Verse 2]
Look at my neck, cashin' the check
She fly out to see me, hop on the jet
Now she on the west, yeah, that's my baby
Pussy makin' me crazy, yeah, the pussy the best
I love the way that she moan
And when she get excited when I go down low
And I just might dive in, that pussy is flowing
And I ain't scared to drown in it if the water is yours

[Pre-Chorus]
She said she wanna chill, well come over later (yeah)
Don't worry about us, send the driver to come get you, baby
No, you don't wanna be lonely, do me a favor (yeah)
When we making love, you better put it all on me, on me

[Chorus]
Put it on me every single time (on me)
That pussy mine, yeah (you better put it all on me)
Put it on me every single time (on me)
That pussy mine (you better put it all on me)

[Pre-Chorus]
She said she wanna chill, well come over later (yeah)
Don't worry about us, send the driver to come get you, baby
No, you don't wanna be lonely, do me a favor (yeah)
When we making love, you better put it all on me, on me

[Chorus]
Put it on me every single time (on me)
That pussy mine, yeah (you better put it all on me)
Put it on me every single time (on me)
That pussy mine (you better put it all on me)
