[Verse 1]
I've written so many letters, tried to e-mail you, all I ask is why you dodging me?
And he's not any better, I could do you better than he can
I see the way you are with me I know that you ain't satisfied
But it's like you don't even remember

[Chorus]
It's like I don't even matter on your birthday, for the holidays
Got me going crazy, you're on my mind
It's like I don't even matter, your love is gone, girl you're done with me
Do you think about us, I miss you so much, it's like I don't even matter

[Verse 2]
I miss the smell of your perfume, I lay by the fireplace
I guess tonight is the night I miss your touch
Baby, I need you, the only love I have in my heart is for you
Can't even live, can't even live with the pain I feel inside
This is real
Why you giving up? Can you see me? Am I invisible?
I see the way you are with me I know that you ain't satisfied
But it's like you don't even remember

[Chorus]
It's like I don't even matter on your birthday, for the holidays
Got me going crazy, you're on my mind
It's like I don't even matter, your love is gone, girl you're done with me
Do you think about us, I miss you so much, it's like I don't even matter

[Bridge]
Girl I see you don't get my love so unconditional
Back and forth, in and out with us, with us
Girl I want you, yeah and nobody else
If I can't have you I'mma break down

[Chorus]
It's like I don't even matter on your birthday, for the holidays
Got me going crazy, you're on my mind
It's like I don't even matter, your love is gone, girl you're done with me
Do you think about us, I miss you so much, it's like I don't even matter
