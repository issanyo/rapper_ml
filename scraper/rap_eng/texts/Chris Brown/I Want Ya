[Verse 1]
Girl, I love what you are wearing
It's the perfect time, to take you out tonight
We can make everybody jealous
Cause my love and kisses are for you tonight
Get it all baby, Lovin' in the foreign getting naughty
We ain't even gonna make it to the party, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, when me and you alone
Got you turning off your phone
Loving in the car, before we get to my place
I just want to kiss you right upon them lips
A drink of this bottle, come take a sip
Love the way that dress, fits on your hips
Girl, it's giving me problems
Oh, I'm driving, swerving switching lanes
I'm nervous, sorry if I get a little bit naughty
I-i-i-i-want you, I-i-i-i-want you
I-i-i-i-want you, I-i-i-i-want you

[Chorus]
Oh, when me and you alone
Got you turning off your phone
Loving in the car, before we get to my place
I just want to kiss you right upon them lips
A drink of this bottle, come take a sip
Love the way that dress, fits on your hips
Girl, it's giving me problems
Oh, I'm driving, swerving switching lanes
I'm nervous, sorry if I get a little bit naughty
I-i-i-i-want you, I-i-i-i-want you
I-i-i-i-want you, I-i-i-i-want you
