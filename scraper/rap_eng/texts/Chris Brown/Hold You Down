[Intro: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
I'll hold you down
I'm on my way
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Jeremih, August Alsina & DJ Khaled]
All you've been thinking 'bout
Do anything you want and let emotion rule your mind
Rule your mind (We The Best Music)
And now you say you're dreaming of doing it anywhere
Oh yeah, just tell me where it's on your mind
On your mind (Another one)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sit in my whip and see the stars (And see the stars)
Show me just who you are (Show me just who you are)
You know who really hold you down (Hold you down)
And when you not around (And when you're not around)

[Chorus: August Alsina, Jeremih, (DJ Khaled) & Future]
I'll hold you down
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
I'm the one gon' hold you down
I'm on my way
I'm the one that be rolling up
In that Bentley truck 'cause I'm rolling up
Want you like right now (Right now)
You the one got all I need
Give me all of you or all of me 'cause
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
(Git, git, git)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I had some problems back home (So I heated up)
I ain't with that bullshit at all (Then I laid it down)
Maybe it's that Virginia in me (Nigga, say something)
Have a young nigga go so hard (And stay stunting)
Oh, but through it all you stuck with me
Through it all you never ducked off like them cowards
When it hit me, get me?
Girl, I swear to God you the real one and you know it
And I don't hurt anyone of y'all for the real one and you know it
And I hold it down
Started from the bed, ended up on the floor
And I lift that ass up off the ground
I'ma put you on my shoulders, let me give you what's in store
Girl, you deserve it, all the time you been serving
Away from the realest nigga in it, I'ma take you away
And I'll hold you down, I'ma hold you down
I'ma hold you down, baby

[Chorus: August Alsina, Jeremih, (DJ Khaled) & Future]
I'll hold you down
I'm the one gon' hold you down
I'm the one gon' hold you down
I'm on my way
I'm the one that be rolling up
In that Bentley truck 'cause I'm rolling up
Want you like right now (Right now)
You the one got all I need
Give me all of you or all of me 'cause
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
(Future, git, git, git)

[Verse 3: Future]
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
Put you in that Ghost so you enjoy the town
Even when the roses die, you mesmerized by the flying sky
We gotta socialize and cherish times (Git, git)
This shit is deeper than love
I pull up in that Lamborghini (Woo), the doors in the sky
Shit is straight up suicide
You in that new Bentley truck, new, new Bentley truck (Oh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We've been playing in that Versace (I swear)
We go to Abu Dhabi for a hobby (Git, git)
Your body my new Bugatti (Woo)

[Chorus: August Alsina, Jeremih, (DJ Khaled) & Future]
I'll hold you down
I'm the one gon' hold you down
I'm the one gon' hold you down
I'm on my way
I'm the one that be rolling up
In that Bentley truck 'cause I'm rolling up
Want you like right now (Right now)
You the one got all I need
Give me all of you or all of me 'cause
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
(Git, git, git)

[Verse 4: August Alsina & DJ Khaled]
Live an expensive life
And I'm just getting started, I get instant hype
'Cause you're forever my lady
Forever my baby (Real life)
Hold you down, hold you down
Girl, you helped me up when I was down, in and out, girl
Hold you down like I'm supposed to
Real nigga, I know you
Real nigga, I know you (Another one)

[Chorus: August Alsina w/ Chris Brown, Jeremih, (DJ Khaled) & Future]
I'll hold you down
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
I'm the one gon' hold you down
I'm on my way
I'm the one that be rolling up
In that Bentley truck cause I'm rolling up
Want you like right now (Right now)
You the one got all I need
Give me all of you or all of me cause
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm the one's that's gon' hold you down
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
(Git, git, git)
