Lil mama, what it is?
Hey shawty, what it do?
Holla at your boy, I'm the truth
Baby, I'ma have to get
Everythin' you got
Come and take a seat in my drop
Lil mama, what it is?
I know that you feel it too
Baby girl, what you gonna do?
Baby, I'ma have to get it, get it, get it, get it
Girl, get it, get it, get it, get it tonight

[Verse 1: Click]
You know I step in the thing so fresh
Chain lookin' like lemonade on my chest
Everybody wanna know the gang that I rep
I'm so fly, shawty think I came in the jet
She don't like the gap my front teeth
But when I'm pushin' the Porsche, she say I look cute in the front seat
No brains in the whip so the car crazy
I'm the ish, holla at your boy, baby
I'm a pimp, the other man's not
Stacks so large, make the rubber band pop
I'm kinda quiet but my neck and my wrist shout
After the last song, I'ma take her to Chris house

[Verse 2: Click]
Game in the game ill, think you need a sick leave
Your girl want me, she huggin' on my shirt sleeve
Chris gave the clearance,  told me don't stress it
And girl givin' brains, I think I need a lesson
Breathe, stretch, shake, walk it out
Somebody tell the boys what the real talk about
Bring the rum to the toast 'cause I'm over 21
And I'm so fly
Withe green in the Dutch, lean in the cup
Freeze when I stunt, get as clean as I want
Breeze on a cutie with a coochie and a booty
She can here a fan but she leavin' here a groupie

[Verse 3: Click]
Yes, yes, shawty, show me what you workin' with
You doin' your thing, I like how she twerkin' it
You movin' in ways my mind can't remember
That necklace and watch is cold like December
Shawty get that number but you wanna act up
You see the mustard Jag', now you wanna catch up?
I ain't lookin' for relationship
I need a girl to ride high when I'm cruisin' in my new whip
Top is roofless, slow down, baby
You can rumble in the jungle when we go down, baby
But it's so crazy and yet so special
Cut her with Chanel and later on sex you

[Verse 4: Click]
Stepped out the car, brushin' my attire
Roll king to the club in a truck colored dollar
Walked right in, all eyes on me
They pointin' and lookin', yeah, that's that guy Street
We party up, livin' the club
Too many bitches on me, you would think I threw bread in the club
We superstars, all my homies gettin' fed in the club
This is pleasure, I ain't lookin' for love, I'm tryna cut it
Yeah, I be doin' my thing
Green diamonds on my neck, she asked was it Mountain Dew on my chain
Swag fresh, I know that you like it
Call me up, ma, so I can beat it up harder than Tyson
