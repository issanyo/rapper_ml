[Intro: Coral Cordova]
Vinny Bee, Chris Brown, ow

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All my trees is exotic, I get high with the pilot
Flyin' overseas, burnin' on some trees
I get oh so turned up
I get oh so turned up

[Hook: Chris Brown & Coral Cordova)
I be on that foreign, foreign, foreign
(You don't know about it)
I be on that foreign, foreign, foreign
(You don't know about it)
I be on that foreign, foreign, foreign
(You don't know about it)
You don't know about it
You don't know about it
Foreign

[Verse 1: Vinny Bee]
Uno, dos, tr√©s, go..
Gonna ride this chick like a rodeo
Talkin' model shit, portfolio
But I'm done here now, time to up and go
So I fly down to Jamaica, smokin' on that Jamaica
Roll up a few mo' papers, then I go head up to Asia
You know I got that foreign, went and spun the wheel
Tryna, get some of that fortune
Pourin', drippin' down her back
Got her, legs on the, dashboard talkin' dirty
Think I got some lipstick on my passport
Y'all lames ain't on my platform
Gettin' my Euros and spittin' the truth
Killin' the game, homicide in the booth
Still in the youth, but don't fuck with a prude
Cause I'm not in the mood if you not gettin' nude (Girl)
I don't speak ya language
But, you's erotic, I be thinkin' that she got it
Cause I'm thinkin' that she 'bout it
She be knowin' she the hottest
Goddamn, ain't she hypnotic

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All my trees is exotic, I get high with the pilot
Flyin' overseas, burnin' on some trees
I get oh so turned up
I get oh so turned up

[Hook: Chris Brown & Coral Cordova)
I be on that foreign, foreign, foreign
(You don't know about it)
I be on that foreign, foreign, foreign
(You don't know about it)
I be on that foreign, foreign, foreign
(You don't know about it)
You don't know about it
You don't know about it
Foreign

[Verse 2: Vinny Bee
Peso, Euro, stack it on top of the girls
Bueno, como estas, women all over the world
Moolah, foreign whip, bad chick with nice hips
That lady with that green shit can hop up in my Eclipse
And roll, I gotta get you stoned
Smokin' on an O off some dro on the low
Please don't pick up the phone
Ya know my shit ya ringtone
And let that green burn slow
Get it, green? CeeLo, ha

[Bridge: Vinny Bee]
I'll hit up a hundred cities
Sign some tig ol' bitties then I'll go and pet the kitty
All I want right now's a quickie
Someone give me an atlas
I'm goin' on this foreign shit and I ain't talkin' MapQuest

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All my trees is exotic, I get high with the pilot
Flyin' overseas, burnin' on some trees
I get oh so turned up
I get oh so turned up

[Hook: Chris Brown & Coral Cordova)
I be on that foreign, foreign, foreign
(You don't know about it)
I be on that foreign, foreign, foreign
(You don't know about it)
I be on that foreign, foreign, foreign
(You don't know about it)
You don't know about it
You don't know about it
Foreign

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Got a chick so foreign, you gon' need a passport to see her
No lie, no lie, I done bought the lie, I do imports
Don't needa key to drive, I'm just ballin' hard
I got Bose's in the car, bump the trunk and it's all on
Hold up
Oh oh, this that Foreign, yeah
Oh oh, this that Foreign, whoa
Oh oh, this that Foreign, yeah

Got a couple hundred stacks, hundred stacks, watch em fallin'
Foreign this, foreign that, foreign chick, foreign tat
Foreign back, I got all the foreign that, foreign that

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All my trees is exotic, I get high with the pilot
Flyin' overseas, burnin' on some trees
I get oh so turned up
