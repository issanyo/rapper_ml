[Verse 1]
Oh girl, why you gotta be like that? (girl)
Why gotta hang up on me then you call right back? (back)
How you compare me to them niggas that you gave your heart to? (heart to)
Probably 'cause you ain't used to someone being all for you (all for you)
You the MVP, baby, you the plug, you the one I take home to mama (baby, you the plug, you the one)
You know I pull up when you holla (you know I pull up when you holla)
Make you better, make sure you ain't fuckin' up (make sure you ain't fuckin' up)
Love it when you talk that shit, think you slick (talk that shit)
You gon' end up with your back broke, legs wide, hickeys on your neck, yeah (back broke, legs wide, hickeys on your neck)
You know I'm that nigga, you gon' give me my respect (you gon' give me my respect)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, not tryna lock you down (lock you down)
But I want you to know, it's the real niggas around (it's the real niggas around)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh girl, they don't, make 'em like you no more (no)
That's why you get a song about you (you)
You so stuck up baby, you mean as fuck (fuck)
But it ain't your fault, hol' up

[Chorus]
Now I blame it on them other niggas
It ain't you, girl, it's them other niggas
Blame it on them other niggas, yeah
I know you tired, baby, I know you tried, baby
That nigga was a lesson, why you stressin'?
Baby, don't you miss your blessin', know you're hesitant
Girl, I blame it on them other niggas (other niggas)
I know you tired, baby, I know you tried, baby

[Verse 2]
I can tell you had enough (had enough)
Never said it'd be easy, baby, don't give up (give up)
You got so much potential left inside you, girl (girl)
Don't let none of these niggas set you back, let me help you bounce back, yeah (bounce back)
You can get it, yeah, you can get it, you deserve it, baby (get it, you can get it, you deserve it, baby)
Gon' and get it, get it, gon' and get it 'cause ain't no limit, shawty (gon' and get it, get it, gon' and get it)
Gon' and spend it, spend it, gon' and spend it (gon' and spend it, spend it)
That nigga let you go, baby, now you're mine (now you're mine)
You gon' end up with a baby, don't play, know you like it rough (baby, don't play)
Love it when you scratchin' on me, messing up my clothes (messing up my clothes)
Know your mama love me and I'm cool with all your brothers (brothers)
Who you know gon' hit it like he hate you but he love you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh girl, they don't, make 'em like you no more (no)
That's why you get a song about you (you)
You so stuck up baby, you mean as fuck (fuck)
But it ain't your fault, hol' up

[Chorus]
Now I blame it on them other niggas
It ain't you, girl, it's them other niggas
Blame it on them other niggas, yeah
I know you tired, baby, I know you tried, baby
That nigga was a lesson, why you stressin'?
Baby, don't you miss your blessin', know you're hesitant
Girl, I blame it on them other niggas (other niggas)
I know you tired, baby, I know you tried, baby
