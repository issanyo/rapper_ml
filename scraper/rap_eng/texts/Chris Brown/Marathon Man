[Verse 1: HoodyBaby]
Word around town, it's a drug war
Step into my crib, it's a drug store
I don't need nothin', I just want more
Real dope boy, I took the coke on tour
Take a walk with me, this a plug talk
Funny how this work got me takin' off
Hittin' it for bricks and I make it off
HoodyBaby, I'm the boss cause I paid the cost
Young niggas sellin' coke, I got WiFi
Side bitches suckin' dick from the sideline
Fuck boys, they ain't stickin' to the guidelines
The world is yours nigga, I want mine

[Hook: HoodyBaby]
Classic, did my thing with the coke nigga
Marathon man, I be runnin' with the dope dealers
Sippin' Ace of Spades, gettin' drunk with the gold diggers
100 thousand dollar cross, feelin' like the Pope nigga

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Marathon man, nigga cheatin' like I'm Lance
Last week I was in France, 150 up in Cannes
Say I can't nigga, I can, boy don't make me pull them choppers out
Check my chopper style, send that ass back to your mama house
Bitch, you think I'm playin', I spend 50 thousand on the dance
Ain't no evidence cause the judge ain't find no skeleton
I be runnin' laps in my trap
Ain't gotta be strapped 'fore a nigga take your tap, OHB, bitch

[Hook: HoodyBaby]
Classic, did my thing with the coke nigga
Marathon man, I be runnin' with the dope dealers
Sippin' Ace of Spades, gettin' drunk with the gold diggers
100 thousand dollar cross, feelin' like the Pope nigga

[Verse 3: Luvaboy TJ]
Luvaboy, I tell her what she wanna hear
OHB, that lil hoe, make it disappear
I just wanna hit that pussy from the rear
Have a orgy with your friends just to keep it fair
Spittin' flame, young out can't be tamed, I'm the fuckin' man
Half a pound, break it all down, Edward Scissorhands
Add the boost, molly and the Xans, we in candy land
Stanckin' gingerbread man, catch me if you can

[Hook: HoodyBaby]
Classic, did my thing with the coke nigga
Marathon man, I be runnin' with the dope dealers
Sippin' Ace of Spades, gettin' drunk with the gold diggers
100 thousand dollar cross, feelin' like the Pope nigga
Yeah, I'm feelin' like the Pope nigga
Marathon man, marathon man
Marathon man, marathon man
Marathon man, marathon man
Marathon man, marathon man
Marathon man, marathon man
Marathon man, marathon man
Marathon man, marathon man
Marathon man
