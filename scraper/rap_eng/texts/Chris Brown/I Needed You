[Intro]
Every child grows up, with the thought of being something special in life
But what happens when the one that they depend on the most is never there?

[Verse 1]
Told that I'm supposed to fail
I wouldn't amount to much of nothing
Yes, I pray
There was days I wondered if you really loved me
But baby, you feel pain
Mama was sane when I felt like running away
I couldn't take it
I soon hit ten, angry with all of the world
I couldn't keep friends, just wishing you'd come back and see
My difficult times being an adolescent
And like so many just like me without a shoulder to lean

[Chorus]
I needed you when I needed a father figure
I needed you to stop me from making the wrong decisions
At seventeen, when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
I need, I needed you
I need, I needed you

[Verse 2]
Told that I'm supposed to fail
I wouldn't amount to much of nothing
Yes I pray
There was days I wondered if you really loved me
But baby, you feel pain
Mama was sane when I felt like running away
I couldn't take it
I soon hit ten, angry with all of the world
I couldn't keep friends just wishing you'd come back and see
My difficult times being an adolescent
And like so many just like me without a shoulder to lean

[Chorus]
I needed you when I needed a father figure
I needed you to stop me from making the wrong decisions
At seventeen, when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
When temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go
I needed you, I need, I needed you
I needed you, I need, I need you
Seventeen when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
When temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go

[Bridge]
Lord I pray, give me strength to forgive them and not all the I hate I got
Even though the pain of this was too heavy
Lord I pray, show me all brothers growing up without a father
How to turn with a day adolescent to a legacy, Lord I pray

[Outro]
From the knowledge I ain't get, God, you gave me
And temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go
