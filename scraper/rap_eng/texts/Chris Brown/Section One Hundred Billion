[Verse 1: HoodyBaby]
I don't know how to do this shit
I wake up and just do this shit
HoodyBaby, I'm too legit
I'm the Boss, I made Hugo quit
I pull up in a 2 door whip
Make you go sick
Flip a brick, kick a brick
That judo shit
My niggas is serious
You niggas delirious
No stoppin' us, period
I live at the dealership
Angry, a nigga rich
We want the bigger fish
Choppin' 'til I chop with the mafia
Ask in my section, we popular
Popavich, we poppin' shots

[Verse 2: Inch]
Pull up with the OH, I mean war
I mean war, big rass war
Big rass that will lick down your car
See me with the gang, better know that squad

[Verse 3: Young Lo]
If these niggas talkin' reckless, see 'em on my necklace
100 round drum, niggas gon' respect us
Mob ties, yeah I'm heavy with these accents
Hit the UK, I'm mobbin' with the Section
Out here ballin' since a adolescent
I was 15 when I start finessin'
Told a teacher fuck her math lesson
I was juggin' through the whole class session

[Verse 4: Swift]
Trap money, I'm a trapper
My young boy once had Rihanna
Flash a blockia like a camera
Slap slap, that's the hammer
Count grand to my nana's
Sucky sucky, from hatters

[Verse 5: Deepee]
I ain't ina the passa, passa
If I clutch a bruck, you go back up
Get me down, I get back
Yo mi casa es su casa
6 man in the van, that's gang in the pan
That's macaroni and pasta
Bring a nigga from a born I'm badder
Girl climb on cocky with a ladder

[Verse 6: Sleeks]
And keep climbin'
Cause she a bad bitch with her manner
I know a mad man with a dagger
That says, "Fuck feds" in the camera
Trappin', pick up a brick
Rip it in bits, gone
I'm really livin' this shit, pick up a stick
You could see smoke like a bong

[Verse 7: Littlez]
Peng peng, wanna get groovy
Man I turn your girl to a groupie
Gold ratchet tings and bougie
With a big boobies and booty
See the big tall man move bookey
Old school, my bros, no new Gs
Roll with a clip like the movies
Man I kick man down like Bruce Lee

[Verse 8: Young Pluto]
I got all of these bitches, they papi chulo
They ain't want me then but they want me now
Got that killer swag, watch 'em mime my style
I done stacked up a milli from petty crime
Got some new shoes off some new shit
This flow is like water need crew ships
My life is a movie, take your flick
It's a foreign bitch cause

[Verse 9: Famous Fresh]
They know I'm flexin'
OHB and Section
.40 for protection
Hood stay connected
Blue bitches, we the 100 gang
Couple JLos on my money train
Nigga been fresh, feds watchin'
Diamonds dancin' like a Jabbawockee
Your bitch ride me like a Kawasaki
It's Fresh, Hoody, it's happy papi
