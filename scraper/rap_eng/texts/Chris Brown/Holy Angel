[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't have to make believe you're here
Holy angel, just stop the fire that burns in me
I need a saviour cause I'm scared of me

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I done been through hell and back
I'm seein' demons everyday, callin' me Kettle Black
Perfectionists if you're perfect, where your medal at?
My life was goin' downhill, I had to pedal back
These niggas always wanna talk about the lame shit
If I looked back on my life, I wouldn't change shit
Maybe a couple more cars so I can lane switch
If I put that mic on silence and never sang shit
This my life and this your job dawg
I'm too hot, got me thinkin' did the clouds fall? Probably not
Shit, just put me back up in the bleachers
Back when all a nigga had was a pair of sneakers
All this stress on my chest, I'm fuckin' having seizures
Nowadays, havin' fun is fuckin' illegal
Walkin' with your head down, that's not grown man shit
I'm takin' over the game until I own that bitch
Yeah nigga, in my hood them choppers always bustin'
Niggas livin' day to day like tomorrow ain't nothin'
Fuck love, that shit get in the way now
She lovin' every nigga, ass up and face down
Addicted to the game, my young'ns use a .38, first 48
They gon' throw that shit away, bet they never catch a case
I'm gon' separate myself from all the lames
If I die and float away, you gon' feel my mama pain
Sittin' in my room, I'm reminiscin'
Shit, I ain't have a pot to piss in
Family whippin' crack up in the kitchen
All eyes on me, so pay attention
Got a problem with the DA, should've stayed my ass in VA
Thousand hours some bull, pickin' trash up off the freeway
I'm the nigga that the kids lookin' up to
Straight A's now before they say "Fuck school"
Ha and I don't bite my tongue for no weak nigga
Cause y'all never had to starve for a week nigga
No clothes but 44 to a house hold
Stomach growlin' but I kept my fuckin' mouth closed

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't have to make believe you're here
Holy angel, just stop the fire that burns in me
I need a saviour cause I'm scared of me

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Came in the game thinkin' music was the way out
To get us off the corners, hit records was the pay out
Hard transitionin' from hustlin' 'til it's grey out
A decade with the devil, lemme show you how this play out
Started as a duo, didn't stay a duo
Things fall apart, Ricky Martin left Menudo
Was a team of us, everything was for the crew though
Never Ros√© while my niggas sippin' Nuvo
So, so records bought more dope
Every record label dollar went to more coke
Ghetto rich but still scramblin' like we poor folks
We was all goin' left from what the Lord taught
The pressure, my pride wouldn't let up
The way they took my niggas had us thinkin' we was set up
All at once so the pain hardly let up
Now this bitch mumblin' 'round the house about she fed up
Yugh, when it rains, it pours, nigga
Dope boys expect the money, hungry whore nigga
Woo, with my niggas and the feds
Do you think I give a fuck if Def Jam is in the red?
They'll undership your record while they pillow talk in bed
So I never try to talk them motherfuckers off the ledge
"Jump nigga," like Joe Clark said
If you ain't tryna win then you better off dead, gone

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't have to make believe you're here
Holy angel, just stop the fire that burns in me
I need a saviour cause I'm scared of me
