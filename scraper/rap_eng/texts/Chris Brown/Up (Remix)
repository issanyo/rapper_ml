[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
It's a big big world
It's easy to get lost in it
You've always been my girl, uh
And I'm not ready to call it quits

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
We can make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies
I know it's hard
Baby, believe me

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That we can't go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we've got to fear
We'll take it to the sky pass the moon through the galaxy
As long as you are with me baby
Honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
It's a big big world
And, girl, I'm gonna show you all of it
I'm gonna lace you with pearls, oh
From every ocean that we're swimming in

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
We can make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make those grey clouds turn to blue skies
Yeah, I know it's hard
Baby, believe me, oh, yeah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Chris Brown]
That we can't go nowhere but up, up
From here, my dear, yeah
Baby, we can go nowhere but up, up, woah
Tell me what we've got to fear, woah
We'll take it to the sky pass the moon through the galaxy, yeah
As long as you are with me baby
Honestly,  okay, with the strength of our love, our love
We can go nowhere but up
Nowhere, nowhere but up
Nowhere but up

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Chris Brown]
Baby, we were underground, we're on the surface now
We're gonna make it, girl, I promise
If you believe in love and you believe in us
We can't go nowhere but up

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Chris Brown]
That we can't go nowhere but up, yeah, yeah
From here, my dear, woah, oh
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Just tell me, tell me what we've got to fear
We'll take it to the sky pass the moon through the galaxy
As long as you are with me baby
Honestly, with the strength of our love

[Outro: Justin Bieber & Chris Brown]
Nowhere but up, I'll take you there, I'll take you there
Nowhere but up, I'll take you there, I'll take you there
Woah, nowhere but up, I'll take you there, I'll take you there
Woah, woah, yeah, we can, we can, honestly, nowhere but up, I'll take you there, I'll take you there, girl, yeah, yeah
