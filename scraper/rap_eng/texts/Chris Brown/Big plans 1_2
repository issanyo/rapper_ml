[Chorus: Zach Herron & Daniel Seavey]
Real big plans, baby for you and me
So love me for who I am, and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want, but got everything you need (baby)
So take a chance, take a chance on me (t-take a chance)
I got real big plans

[Jonah Marais & Corbyn Besson]

Down the halls
Into your room, show me what you got (baby)

I got real big plans
For you


[Pre Chorus: Zach Herron]

I woke up in chris browns body

This shit turned into freaky friday (what the fuck)

I can't believe that its freaky friday

Im in chris browns body i look at my soft dick

My dream dick

Yo, I kay cook on my cock like a mf block

Got this mf rock you about to get mf glocked

Goodnight stan stray kids
