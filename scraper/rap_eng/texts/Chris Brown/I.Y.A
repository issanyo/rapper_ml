[Verse 1]
I was crazy when I said I didn't love you
From the first time that I ever saw you
The emotions running deep underneath my skin
Sign anywhere for your love, where do we begin?

[Pre-Chrous]
So lay me down
Tell me what I wanna hear
Take me down
There's nobody else I'd rather be with

[Chorus]
I wanna wake up in your arms
I wanna wake up in your arms
I wanna wake up in your arms
I wanna wake up in your arms

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, woah

[Verse 2]
If my heart is outta place, move over
I could've told you how it hurts, could've told ya
And now I want you, I can feel it in my heartbeat
It's like a race, like I'm running in a track meet

[Pre-Chrous]
So lay me down, oh
Tell me what I wanna hear, oh
Take me down, oh
There's nobody else I'd rather be with, oh

[Chorus]
I wanna wake up in your arms
I wanna wake up in your arms
I wanna wake up in your arms
I wanna wake up in your arms

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, woah
