[Verse 1]
Let me see what you about
Okay, I'ma fly you out, walk your pretty ass in my house
We ain't even gotta fuck on the first night
Baby, we can lay up, yeah, I know you had a long flight
I'ma keep it player, take the bed, I'ma take the couch
You say you ahead, first place, let me eat you out
Got that dope dick all the bad bitches talk about
She feel my nose ring, when I eat it, I'ma turn her out
Already know my figures, OHB the pussy killers
With the pistols and the strippers and a whole lot of bitches
She gon' shift it, I'ma whip it, she off the white, I'm off the Henny
Where you get all that energy? Run around through the biddy
I'm the man in my city, know that you like consistency
You know that I'm in love if I fuck when your pussy bleed
Send that text to your homegirl, OMG
Now you mad 'cause your bitches wanna fuck me
But we gon' be aight tonight
Hella high, bitch, higher than life
Baby, you just might be right tonight
Got me feeling like Mike tonight, moonwalk and then the ring with the flights
.45 by my side, yeah, your partner can die
No nigga hotter than I, them bullets burn like they fire
Razor blade or a knife? Let's have a moment of silence
Okay, let's go 'cause all I'm hearing is sirens

[Chorus]
I gotta run now, you hear the gun sound
My heart beat, he already bleeding
Call the paramedics, shit I know he need it
Promise me his mama won't see it
Sirens screaming like wo-o-oh
I hear 'em screaming, wo-o-oh
Sirens screaming like, wo-o-oh
Playing with your life, I ain't come to fight, fucked up my whole night

[Verse 2]
Be careful with your wordplay, niggas be bitches, snitchin'
Tellin' them federal agents where the birds stay (hoe ass nigga)
Catch him, set him on fire
Light his ass up like a motherfuckin' birthday
The way I live, you could beg to differ, you don't know the smell
Know it's hard to sell when your uncle steady smokin' dipper
Who was there to tell me right or wrong? (No)
He was there to teach me how to flip a pot, couldn't write a song
I just did it for my city, put my family on
And I know you still rockin' with me, even when I'm wrong
I done been in trial, still had my jewelry on
Mama say that white people change when the money come
Pussy ass niggas, know you wanna build a case
Squares in your circle, yeah, you niggas outta shape
Never outta pocket, you know I got it in the safe
Boy, stop it, shooters hangin' off helicopters, yeah

[Chorus]
I gotta run now, you hear the gun sound
My heart beat, he already bleeding
Call the paramedics, shit I know he need it
Promise me his mama won't see it
Sirens screaming like wo-o-oh
I hear 'em screaming, wo-o-oh
Sirens screaming like, wo-o-oh
Playing with your life, I ain't come to fight, fucked up my whole night

[Verse 3]
Government lyin', could give a fuck about your education
Don't want an intelligent nigga, keepin' us intimidated
Instigatin', let us kill each other, now they celebratin'
Fallin' victim, takin' us to prison, yeah, we back to slavin'
Programmed to kill my brother if he tryna kill my niggas
Molotov the corporation, fuck the family business
How many times we gotta scream just for you to listen?
Okay, fuck everybody who ain't ridin' with us
But we gon' be aight tonight
Hella high, bitch, higher than life
Got me feelin' like wrong is right
Do my life got a price? Sometimes a nigga gotta roll the dice
They used to tell me as a kid, I could make a difference
They say a man never cry, leave that for the bitches
Told me hold my head high, never duck the missles
They ain't see I was a kid, only 10 when I first learned how to use a pistol

[Chorus]
I gotta run now, you hear the gun sound
My heart beat, he already bleeding
Call the paramedics, shit I know he need it
Promise me his mama won't see it
Sirens screaming like wo-o-oh
I hear 'em screaming, wo-o-oh
Sirens screaming like, wo-o-oh
Playing with your life, I ain't come to fight
Fucked up my whole night
F-f-fucked up my whole night
F-f-fucked up my whole night
Fucked up my whole night
