[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Look, illest of the illest I'm a sick soul
A little margarita blend so I sip slow
Too talented type of nigga I'm kinda schizo
But never out of my element I let that fifth go
Shots in the club panic at the disco
She of that MDMA that's from Frisco
Hella chips call me mister Nabisco
Is that your bitch cause she, won't let my go wrist go
My technique is just sex freaks
Skinny dip with hot models, bitches and lesbies
I'mma put my tongue on they soul like a SB
But they don't know they scum to my soul they're just sexy
I'mma play dumb play that role in that SV, it's ridiculous
And can I get a girl with real ass and tits
Most respect in the world to my real niggas
Cause, all them fake niggas make me wanna kill niggas
I stand alone fuck that gang bang shit
They Nintendo blowing niggas cause this game ain't shit
Uh, it's relevant that I'm better than these 'veterans'
They are sleeping on me like I been givin' them sedatives
Sometimes I wish I had better friends and better peers
Cause I know when that cheddar ends they disappear

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
Damn! Where they go? Where they go? Where they go, huh?

See I'm doper than that shit Pookie was on in New Jack City
This is why I'm getting rich without trying I ain't like fifty
Cause what good is being rich if you're dying that shit is silly
Call the the chain TLC all the ice'll make you chilly
I'm a pimp so you know I'm snatching your broad
I'm a real star, you're Patrick from SpongeBob
And in my city to the streets I'm Freeway Ricky
Cus I keep the streets flooded with that crack music
I be selling CD's like them niggas push kilos
But I don't push weight unless there's plates in the weight room
Why you think I'm BUF? Blowin' Up Fast
Call me lead foot cause I be heavy on the gas
You would think I was a Spartan, 300 on the dash
Either that or a martian in a space aircraft
Cause when you see that whip that I have
You be like "What the fuck was that?!"
