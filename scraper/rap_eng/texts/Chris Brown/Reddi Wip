[Verse 1]
Baby, you gotta be tripping, put that booty away
You know I be sipping, got a bottle on the way
I stay on my pimping, diamonds jumping out the face
Tell 'em get up out the way, nigga, you can catch a fade (ayy)
I'm tryna see, mami, remind me, yeah (ayy)
She like a tsunami, can't lie to me, yeah (ayy)
She ride like Ducati, she got it, yeah (ayy)
Rev it all night

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't really care if they know, I be sipping on the low
'Cause you got the kinda body, make a papi want some more
Alright, dim the lights, let me hit you with that spice
I ain't playing with you, want you to know

[Chorus]
Girl, you got that reddi whip
Reddi whip, reddi whip, aw yeah, uh huh
I just wanna take a dip, in your reddi whip
Reddi whip, aw yeah
Yeah, reddi whip, I'm ready, I'm ready oh
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, reddi whip
I'm ready, I'm ready oh
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, reddi whip

[Verse 2]
Yeah, girl, what you doing tonight?
I'm on dirty Sprite, that means that I'm on you
Yeah, yeah, gripping your ass from the side
Look in my eyes, you know what you gon' do
Say what you say
Make all them faces, make all them faces
Do it your way, do it your way yeah, ahh
All of these hours keep passing by

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I don't really care if they know, I be sipping on the low
'Cause you got the kinda body, make a papi want some more
Alright, dim the lights, let me hit you with that spice
I ain't playing with you, want you to know (know)

[Chorus]
Girl, you got that reddi whip
Reddi whip, reddi whip, aw yeah, uh huh
I just wanna take a dip, in your reddi whip
Reddi whip, aw yeah

I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, reddi whip (hey, hey, reddi whip)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, girl, I love eating that pie
Put whipped cream on your thighs, licking cinnamon off you
Yeah, yeah, girl, you too sweet, they ain't lying
And I thought my life was just hidin', until I found you
Cake on my face, I wanna taste it, girl, let me taste it
I won't say shit
You know I won't say shit, yeah (oh)
All of these hours keep passing by

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I don't really care if they know
I ain't playing, girl, I wanna lick you up and down
Ah yeah, hit them lights, let me hit you with that spice
I ain't playing, girl, I want you to know (know)

[Chorus]
Girl, you got that reddi whip
Reddi whip, reddi whip, aw yeah, uh huh

Reddi whip, aw yeah
