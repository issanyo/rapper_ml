[Verse 1]
Step one, I could be your man
You can call me daddy when we're fucking in the sand
Step two, let's go for a ride, baby
Gotta hold the stick, I'll drive baby
Step three, I be in these streets
Throwing up the west side, chuckin' up the B's
And they can't take away my pride
They just can't take away my pride 'til they bury me

[Pre-Chorus]
Look into my eyes, and see what I see
You're a mind reader, it's just you and me

[Chorus]
I'm ready to go to war for you
I'mma be a warrior, I'mma make sure you're safe with me
I be smoking that Cali and baby me and you can fly
Think it over one more time, yeah, just one more time

[Verse 2]
Okay, yo I'm just a little nigga from a small town
I try to keep a small circle, but these fuck niggas always tryna come around
Bad bitches on deck, I'm about to bring 'em out
You niggas writing bad checks, I make her booty bounce
15 years old I was riding in a Lamborghini
Now I'm 24, got a bigger fucking Lamborghini
Two doors up,like I'm two floors up
It's kill or be killed nigga, either you or us
But I keep it moving like a U-Haul truck
This adolescence, had me stressing, I was too fucked up, I'm gone
What's the point of you having a crown if you ain't got a throne?
If you king you need a queen, now I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Look into my eyes, and see what I see
You're a mind reader, it's just you and me

[Chorus]
I'm ready to go to war for you
I'mma be a warrior, I'mma make sure you're safe with me
I be smoking that Cali and baby me and you can fly
Think it over one more time, yeah, just one more time

[Bridge]
I just need it one more time, do it, can we do it baby?
One more time, do it, one more time, one more time
Baby if we do it, its gon' change our lives
It's kinda late, get some sleep, I'll drive ya, all around the world

[Chorus]
I'm ready to go to war for you
I'mma be a warrior, I'mma make sure you're safe with me
I be smoking that Cali and baby me and you can fly
Think it over one more time, yeah, just one more time
I'm ready to go to war for you
I'mma be a warrior, I'mma make sure you're safe with me
I be smoking that Cali and baby me and you can fly
Think it over one more time, yeah, just one more time
