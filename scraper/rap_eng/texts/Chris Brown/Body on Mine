[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Ha, hot damn, you look so appalled
My girl is the shit, your girl has no ass at all
Her booty super thick, but her tummy super small
And when she dance then her booty swallow up her draws
Yeah buddy in the club I do my dougie
Bottle in my hand, mean mugging like I'm ugly
Only models in my section, get 'em uglies way from me
And when they be like, I just play dummy
In the party got them white girls rolling like whoa
In the morning they be like "Where the fuck are my clothes?"
Please don't tell nobody cause I don't really do this
Sure, what you think I'm stupid
I told her just to call me dada
But shorty Spanish so she wanna call me papa, or papi
Never met a nigga like me
I swept her up, so I guess she had light feet

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
Can we make this an after party?
Cause your body, all on me, and my heads spinning round and round
Can we make this a nasty party?
Cause I just want your body on mine, body on mine and take me down, take me down, down!

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Ha, look, Van's on, so I get my dance on
She said she fucked the whole crew, I put my mans on her
I threw my money on the table, told her dance on it
I pulled that monster out, she put her hands on it
Pool party shawty going gnarly
Only fuck with rock stars and them boys who's riding Harleys
Bitch I'm on your camera, no not iCarly
When she turn 21, I'mma drown with Bacardi
Mmmhmm, one fifty one, heart beating like a drum and my face is kinda numb
Stop that shit, where the hating comig from
Oh you mad cause I got your girl face full of cum

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
Can we make this an after party?
Cause your body, all on me, and my heads spinning round and round
Can we make this a nasty party?
Cause I just want your body on mine, body on mine and take me down, take me down, down!
