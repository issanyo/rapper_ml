[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Say-say-say-say this ain't love, well baby, let me tell you that you dead wrong
I’d give my life for you, nigga tripping, I’d die for you
And I'm ready so, baby, take that shit off, you gotta work, you gon' get it when you get off
I just want you laying down, turn that ass around and I'ma take my time in the middle

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Chris Brown]
I lost your love
That commitment, girl, I made a promise
I've lived and I've learned from it
Do it right, I'ma give you what you want
'Cause baby, your love's got a hold on me
All of your love, I bet a nigga won’t leave
And I wanna touch, you can touch on me
Not just tryna fuck, baby girl, you got my heart

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
It’s so hard looking at you, girl, when you mad at me
All I wanna do is dance with ya, feeling your body close to me
I don’t wanna fall apart, I just wanna wake up, and you’re there
Oh please baby, don’t start, with all this shit, it won’t get us far
I'm going insane
Feeling so high than paper planes
Girl, don’t do what you’re tryna do right now
Confused, I want you to hear me out, yeah

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Chris Brown]
I lost your love (oh yeah)
That commitment, girl, I made a promise
I've lived and I've learned from it (woah, oh)
Do it right, I'ma give you what you want (give you what you want)
'Cause baby, your love's got a hold on me
All of your love, I bet a nigga won’t leave
And I wanna touch, you can touch on me (oh, oh)
Not just tryna fuck, baby girl, you got my heart (look)

[Verse 3: Game & (Ty Dolla $ign)]
You know I love you, you know I need you
You 'bout it, 'bout it, yeah, I Master P'd you
Never lied to you, never deceived you
You like my city, swear I’ll never leave (oh, oh)
Might step out for a minute, get some fresh air
Might drop the top off the Bel Air, off in Bel Air
Say you want me now, shit, I'm like hell yeah
I woke up from that dream, she wasn't even there, I hate that

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Chris Brown]
I lost your love (I lost your love)
That commitment, girl, I made a promise
I've lived and I've learned from it (I've lived and I've learned)
Do it right, I'ma give you what you want
'Cause baby, your love's got a hold on me, yeah
All of your love, I bet a nigga won’t leave (leave)
And I wanna touch, you can touch on me
Not just tryna fuck, baby girl, you got my heart (you got my heart)
