[Intro: R. Kelly & (Rick Ross)]
Oh, woah, oh, woah
(Trilla)
Oh, woah, oh, woah

[Verse 1: Rick Ross, R. Kelly & (Chris Brown)]
Every dollar that I count can't grow in my account
My account can't count up all my money in an hour
'Cause it's comin' too fast and I'm scared it won't last
Look that white girl in her face told her this was her last dance
Goddamn, speed got my heart racin'
See I don't have the nominations you can blame it on my occupation (ayy, ayy)
Ceasar salad, Caesars Palace (ayy, ayy, ayy)
You not a boss, little nigga, 'cause your cheese is average (oh)
In the Benz, AK ridin' shotgun
It's a Benz 'cause your broke 'til you got one
It ain't nothing, do 100 in the Maybach
Throwin' money out the roof motherfuckin' brake pads (ballin', I'm a beast)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm a boss (I'm a boss), I ball
Stay shinin' on all of y'all
'Cause I'm speedin', speedin'
Been runnin' for years
But you could find me just speedin'
I'm taking off, yeah
'Cause I'm speedin', (I'm just) speedin'

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Sitting in the living room watching the Grammys
Wishing that was me that was on the Grammys
All I needed was someone to get behind me (ballin', I'm a beast)
I was a determined lil nigga, dirty shoes and Hilfiger
Homie help me out cause this boy is a drug dealer
Now I'm flyin' high 'cause my gift grew wings
And now I'm flyin' down like the cool crew winds
Kells and Ross on the Hollywood scene
Red carpet and it's smellin' like green
Now foss 'cause I got paid off
Collabo was the hit hip-hop and R&B boss (ballin', I'm a beast)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & R.Kelly]
I'm a boss (I'm a boss), I ball (I ball)
Stay shinin' on all of y'all (all of y'all)
'Cause I'm speedin', yeah, yeah, I'm speedin'
I can't stop, it's all I know
From a youngin' I was taught get dough, oh, oh
I'm speedin' (I'm speedin')
I'm speedin'

[Interlude: Rick Ross & (R. Kelly)]
We fly, I think somebody followin' (oh, oh)
We hear the helipad with ya bitch (oh, oh, oh, oh)
You worth fifteen million, baby (oh, oh)
Don't try to blow it all in one week (oh, oh)
Fuck with me, triple seas (oh, oh)
Boss, I'ma fly away on you haters (I'm speedin' I'm speedin')

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm a boss (I'm a boss), I ball
Stay shinin' on all of y'all
'Cause I'm speedin', speedin'
Been runnin' for years
But you could find me just speedin'
I'm taking off, yeah
'Cause I'm speedin', (I'm just) speedin'

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
See people came lookin for me I got ghosts see the west coast
Close and up in the lamontrose, big money, boss major
American Idol, I got fans like fantasia
Read between the lines or yo ass like fantasia
Get hit between the eyes, he died they can't save him
I'm a mosh, I'm weevin' no dope but I'm speedin'
Staring at the skyline, I got a million on my mind, I'm the best
And these pussy niggas running out of time (Ricky Ross)
I'm the chill quarter mill for the time piece
Ya I a bought a wheels like deals for the dime piece

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm a boss (I'm a boss), I ball
Stay shinin' on all of y'all
'Cause I'm speedin', speedin'
Been runnin' for years
But you could find me just speedin'
I'm taking off, yeah
'Cause I'm speedin', (I'm just) speedin'
