[Intro]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Fell in love with nothing right (oh my)
It's like I seen the body, ignored the signs (ignored the signs)
All the things you said, with no regrets (no regrets)
Who cares about the hurt? Who cares about me, girl?
Who cares about me, girl? Oh, do you care about me, girl?

[Chorus]
‘Cause if you did, you wouldn't leave, oh, no
And if you did, my heart would be beating
Oh, but it ain't beating, no, no, no
Ain’t beating
My heart ain't beating, no no no
Ain’t beating, woah

[Bridge]
Was it true, oh why?
I love my baby, she lifts me up

[Verse 2]
Girl, I put you first in everything (everything)
How could your mouth lash out on me? (Out on me)
Ooh, was this the same girl
Who wouldn’t leave without saying I love you?
What did I do? Girl, you never cared about me, girl
Who cares about me, girl? Oh, do you care about me, girl?

[Chorus]
Oh 'cause if you did, you wouldn't leave, oh, no
And if you did, my heart would be beating, oh
Oh, but it ain't beating, no, no, no
Ain’t beating
My heart ain't beating, no no no
Ain’t beating, woah

[Bridge]
Was it true, oh why?
I love my baby, she lifts me up
I love my baby, she lifts me up

[Chorus]
‘Cause if you did, you wouldn't leave, oh, no
And if you did, my heart would be beating
Oh, but it ain't beating, no, no, no
Ain’t beating
My heart ain't beating, no no no
Ain’t beating, woah

[Outro]
Was it true? Oh, no, no, no
