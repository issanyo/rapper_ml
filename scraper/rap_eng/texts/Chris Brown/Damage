[Intro]
Damage, you know
Sometimes you don't realise what you've done
Until you've seen the damage and I looked at the damage
Look at the damage

[Verse 1]
3 A.M. when my phone ring, begging me to come by, I was right around the corner
I know I could've said no but I ain't stop, told me "Come in, the door's unlocked for you"
My intuition, I should have listened to it
My girl yo, she'd be pissed if she knew about this visit
She had a tank top on, I took her tank top off but should've stopped, stop
But she ain't let me, kissed me soft and gently, she tempt me
Right then I stopped thinking consequences
Guess I must have lost my mind for a minute, listen

[Chorus]
Girl you know that I love, girl I love you with her that was lust
Shouldn't have happened, I know I messed up
One phone call started this whole thing now
Look at the damage, damage, look at the damage, damage
Damage, damage that I caused you
I know I broke your heart
Cause I did you wrong now look at the damage
Look at the damage that I caused

[Verse 2:]
The dumbest decision that I made that I ain't proud of
A few hours that meant absolutely nothing cost me your love
I gotta live with regret, deserve to get what you give
Now you won't listen to nothing that I'm saying
I rode passed your house for hours, just to feel close to ya
No cards, no gifts, no flowers, could get me back with you
Your kiss, your touch, girl you know I'm missing
But you got my heart inside a prison, listen

[Chorus]
Girl you know that I love, girl I love you with her that was lust
Shouldn't have happened, I know I messed up
One phone call started this whole thing now
Look at the damage, damage, look at the damage, damage
Damage, damage that I caused you
I know I broke your heart
Cause I did you wrong now look at the damage
Look at the damage that I caused

[Bridge]
I was tripping, I was dipping with these women in these streets
Lost my girl, lost all that, wish I could take it back
I was tripping, I was dipping with these women in these streets
Wish I could, take that back, oh baby

[Chorus]
Girl you know that I love, girl I love you with her that was lust
Shouldn't have happened, I know I messed up
One phone call started this whole thing now
Look at the damage, damage, look at the damage, damage
Damage, damage that I caused you
I know I broke your heart
Cause I did you wrong now look at the damage
Look at the damage that I caused

[Outro]
Look at the damage
Look at the damage, yeah
Sometimes you don't realise what you've done
Until you've seen the damage and I looked at the damage
