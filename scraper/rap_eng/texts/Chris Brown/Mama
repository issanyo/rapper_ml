[Intro]
This one right here, goes out to my mama
This goes out to mama
Your mama and everybody mama, haha
Here we go, listen listen

[Verse 1]
I remember Saturday mornings
Me waking up to mama in the kitchen cooking to Sam Cook
And I was just a young dude, watching morning cartoons
Waiting for mama to braid my hair
I used to hate to get it done cause she’d braid it too tight
My mama always gave a style, she knew I would like
And then I would go outside and play, she’d sit on the front porch
While me and Rob played ball

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama always did little things like that
Mama always will know I love her for that
For all the things that you used to do
Mama I dedicate this one to you

[Chorus]
It’s straight from the heart, this is your song
You’re my lucky charm so you already know
That I'mma sing this one for you
So let me sing this one for you
From every tour, every show
You’re my lucky charm, go wherever I go
Mama I'mma sing this one to you
Mama let me sing this one to you

[Verse 2]
She’s like the mother of Tappahannock, VA
Everybody knew miss Joyce where we stayed
All heads said she was cool, nothing that she wouldn’t do
What about CB? She was known I acted a fool
With the little money that she made
She took the bad and made it all okay
Nights at the daycare, when we had to stay there
Always held it down, so I gotta thank you now

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama always did little things like that
Mama always will know I love her for that
For all the things that you used to do
Mama I dedicate this one to you

[Chorus]
It’s straight from the heart, this is your song
You’re my lucky charm so you already know
That I'mma sing this one for you
So let me sing this one for you
From every tour, every show
You’re my lucky charm, go wherever I go
Mama I'mma sing this one to you
Mama let me sing this one to you

[Bridge]
Mama I thank you for all you’ve done
I thank God everyday I’m your son
Oh, you gave me everything that I need
But loving me unconditionally
Everybody say "MOMMA"
Everybody say mama
"MOMMA"
You know that this is your song

[Chorus]
It’s straight from the heart, this is your song
You’re my lucky charm so you already know
That I'mma sing this one for you
So let me sing this one for you
From every tour, every show
You’re my lucky charm, go wherever I go
Mama I'mma sing this one to you
Mama let me sing this one to you

[Outro]
This right here goes out to every mama all over the world
Mama I know I might be bad at times
I might get on your nerves, but I still love you
You always gonna be my mama, mama, mama, my mama
Mama I'm gonna sing this one to you
Mama let me sing this one to you
Mama I love you
Don’t put nothing above you, I’ll save this one for you
