[Chorus: Lil Mosey, Chris Brown & Both]
Ran in that bitch wit' the Tec, uh huh
Diamonds they drip from my neck, uh huh
Hate me because I'm up next, uh huh
Watch the G-Walk when I step, uh huh
Hop in the coupe goin' crazy
Lil baby, she wan' have my baby
She see me whip a Mercedes
I count these bands on the daily

[Verse 1: Lil Mosey]
Run up in your crib, three deep, when you not home
Why you pay that bitch, for the cheese, nigga, like it's Provologne
And I got a stick make you freeze, nigga, Frozone
Bandkids been the fucking movement, now we all on
Last year, I was dead broke, on some stain shit
New bitches switching up, they be on that same shit
If you ain't talking money, then you don't speak my language
And free my brother [?], reckless nigga in them cages

[Chorus: Lil Mosey, Chris Brown & Both]
Ran in that bitch wit' the Tec, uh huh
Diamonds they drip from my neck, uh huh
Hate me because I'm up next, uh huh
Watch the G-Walk when I step, uh huh
Hop in the coupe goin' crazy
Lil baby, she wan' have my baby
She see me whip a Mercedes
I count these bands on the daily

[Verse 2: Lil Mosey]
Lately, I been rockin' Gucci fits, I got money now
And you be talkin', but nigga you make no sound
And you trynna match, but nigga we got 3 pounds
You can't get a bitch cause I heard that nigga so wrong
Never love a bitch I just fuck her then I pass her
Been had hoes way before I was a rapper
Pocket full of money cause I need my whip faster
Play up on the kid, but they woke up after

[Chorus: Lil Mosey, Chris Brown & Both]
Ran in that bitch wit' the Tec, uh huh
Diamonds they drip from my neck, uh huh
Hate me because I'm up next, uh huh
Watch the G-Walk when I step, uh huh
Hop in the coupe goin' crazy (crazy)
Lil baby, she wan' have my baby (baby)
She see me whip a Mercedes ('cedes)
I count these bands on the daily

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I told my young nigga get it, tell them haters pipe down
I'm tryna fuck a hundred bitches in the hotel right now
My niggas came with the drum, we don’t mean percussion
It go ba-dum-bum-bum-bum, ain’t no repercussion
I get dollars, and dollars, no refund
I got bad bitches asking for threesomes
I tell ‘em giddy up, you know they came to have fun
And it ain't about nothin’ unless my niggas get some
Had her going up and down, like a see-saw
Hit it like I’m Swae Lee, bitch i'm T'd off
A hunnid shots, bulletproof like I’m Young Dolph
Shotgun sawed off, pro-pro-problem solved

[Chorus: Lil Mosey, Chris Brown & Both]
Ran in that bitch wit' the Tec, uh huh
Diamonds they drip from my neck, uh huh
Hate me because I'm up next, uh huh
Watch the G-Walk when I step, uh huh
Hop in the coupe goin' crazy (crazy)
Lil baby, she wan' have my baby (baby)
She see me whip a Mercedes ('cedes)
I count these bands on the daily (on the daily)

[Outro: Lil Mosey]
Hate me because I'm up next, uh huh
Watch the G-Walk when I step, uh huh
