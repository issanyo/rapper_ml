[Verse 1]
Heaven thundered and the world was born
Life begins and ends in the dust You formed
Faith commanded and the mountains moved
Fear is losing ground to our hope in You

[Chorus]
Unstoppable God
Let Your glory go on and on
Impossible things
In Your name they shall be done

[Verse 2]
Freedom conquered, all our chains undone
Sin defeated, Jesus has overcome
Mercy triumphed when the third day dawned
Darkness was denied when the storm was gone

[Chorus]
Unstoppable God
Let Your glory go on and on
Impossible things
In Your name they shall be done
Unstoppable God
Let Your glory go on and on
Impossible things
In Your name they shall be done

[Bridge]
Nothing shall be impossible
Your kingdom reigns unstoppable
We'll shout Your praise forevermore
Jesus, our God unstoppable
Nothing shall be impossible
Your kingdom reigns unstoppable
We'll shout Your praise forevermore
Jesus, our God unstoppable
Nothing shall be impossible
Your kingdom reigns unstoppable
We'll shout Your praise forevermore
Jesus, our God unstoppable

[Chorus]
Unstoppable God
Let Your glory go on and on
Impossible things
In Your name they shall be done
Unstoppable God
Let Your glory go on and on
Impossible things
In Your name they shall be done
