[Verse 1]
Only one conversation
Getting you to my place, yeah
We can have a situation
All you gotta do is say, "Yeah"
But do you really wanna stop now?
You already let me see what it could be
And right now, I don't want you to go without me

[Pre-Chorus]
It seems like every time
I tried to get through to you
Try to slip my way, baby
In my mind we get this right, and
You decide to stay

[Chorus]
Wasn't suppose to end like this
We should keep dancing
I don't want to go home like this
Baby, give me this one last wish
Can you move your hips like this?
Do a little twist
Turn that thing around then dip
And then we in a zone like this
Keep it going like this, yeah

[Verse 2]
Look at us on the floor now
I'm digging everything, I like your smile
Only wanna stay a little while
But you ain't gotta go, no
DJ playing my song now
It's my turn to feel you out
'Cause baby, you know that
All I wanna do is just stay with you, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
It seems like every time
I tried to get through to you
Try to slip my way, baby
In my mind we get this right, and
You decide to stay, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Wasn't suppose to end like this (Yeah)
We should keep dancing (We should keep dancing)
I don't want to go home like this (No)
Baby, give me this one last wish
Can you move your hips like this? (Yeah)
Do a little twist (Yeah)
Turn that thing around then dip
And then we in a zone like this
Keep it going like this, yeah

[Bridge]
Something about the way I get a rise when you next to me
I don't wanna be apart, yeah, yeah
Damn, I'm loving this spotlight
You're turning me on, on, on, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
It wasn't suppose to end like this
We should keep dancing
I don't want to go home like this
Baby, give me this one last wish
It wasn't suppose to end like this
We should keep dancing
I don't want to go home like this
Baby, give me this one last wish
Can you move your hips like this?
Do a little twist
Turn that thing around then dip
And then we in a zone like this
Keep it going like this, yeah
