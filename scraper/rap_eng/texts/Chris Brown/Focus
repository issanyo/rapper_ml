You decide to go
You know that I will be here for a couple things, oh
And finally you decide to talk
But I can’t speak right now girl, I’ve been moving round town
I can’t say it’s a test, it’s only what you did
And I can’t even lie, it fuck me up a bit, oh yeah
But I can’t focus
I’m taking notes to your actions
You think I don’t know about your shit
I think that we missing that
Wanted to make sure you were straight but it wasn’t enough
Take you to the moon and back
I took your ass outer space but it wasn’t enough
