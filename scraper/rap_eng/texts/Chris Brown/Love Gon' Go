[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yeah, we just did it for the wave, for the wave, for the feel of it
For the pleasure, for the pain, be addicted to the thrill of it
We gon' have to be brave, what we done done already, we killed it
Now we going to a whole new level and after that, another level 'til we limitless
She gon' do this forever, make a movie, pussy trilogy
Part 1, me on you, part 2, you on me, part 3, just we on we
And it's gon' be so lit baby, it's gon' be so lit
When it comes to the bed spring work, we just let things work, we the shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Now that's how this love gon' go and that's how this love gon' go
Anytime you need me in the bedroom
Love gon' go, go go go
We got the chemistry in the bedroom
We can fuck some more, baby girl we should fuck some more
'Til I know your body inside out and you know my body head to toe
But only if you don't mind, if you don't mind
If you don't mind baby, love gon' go

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Going on and on even when we both fuck up
You taking highways with checkpoints, take a break, you fucked up
You good under pressure, I get my phone, no more texting
The rules, you just bend 'em and stretch 'em and right now we sexing on sexing on sexing baby
The push and pull, that tossing and turning
That bronco, that raging bull, ride it like you earned it
You sure earned it babe, yeah and you know I earned you
When you and I ahead of time, learn each other, we can have supper at noon

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Now that's how this love gon' go and that's how this love gon' go
Anytime you need me in the bedroom
Love gon' go, go go go
We got the chemistry in the bedroom
We can fuck some more, baby girl we should fuck some more
'Til I know your body inside out and you know my body head to toe
But only if you don't mind, if you don't mind
If you don't mind baby, love gon' go

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Good sex is a passionate art, let's put some paint where it ain't
Couple hickies, couple bites, scratches and marks, we need to leave marks
Marking that territory, like a flare gun, flash in the dark, so we know what we at with it
We used to do each other real good, now we do it real smart
Now the science and the math of it, we were two students of the craft of it
Our sex game was so fresh mane, but now we sex game graduates
Practised and mastered it, woah, #LoveGonGo, #LoveGonGo
Netflix and chill, that's how love gon' go

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Now that's how this love gon' go and that's how this love gon' go
Anytime you need me in the bedroom
Love gon' go, go go go
We got the chemistry in the bedroom
We can fuck some more, baby girl we should fuck some more
'Til I know your body inside out and you know my body head to toe
But only if you don't mind, if you don't mind
If you don't mind baby, love gon' go
