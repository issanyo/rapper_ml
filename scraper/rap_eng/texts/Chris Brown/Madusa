Innocent, heaven sent, that's the way she look (Look)
Make you turn around again, take a second look (Look)
Caught my eye walkin' by out there like she modelin
(And I just had to have her)
My favorite thing to watch on her is her legs
But I love everything about her. There's nothin' to replace
So I call her over to my whip (To my whip)
Tryna see what the business is
Then she hopped up in my ride, ride
Then I looked into her eyes, eyes
She cold as ice, turned me to stone, stone
Couldn't move 'cause the way she rockin' them Jimmy Choo's
I call her Madusa
She the type of girl that seduce ya (She is)
She that type of girl
She that type of girl that'll turn you into stone
Look her in the eyes and you can't leave her alone
She a Madusa
She the type of girl that seduce ya
She the, she the type of girl
She the type of girl that'll turn you into stone
Look her in the eyes and you can't leave her alone
Shawty got what I want. I got what she need (Need)
But I don't mind if she take advantage of me ('Cause)
She got that bomb shit
I'm talkin' atomic
My playa days are demolished
She dun took me out the game
Now she packin' heat, gunnin' for my last name
I can't even lie. Shawty got some great aim
Gotta keep her lookin' good
Man, she really had me hooked
Then she hopped up in my ride, ride
Then I looked into her eyes, eyes
She cold as ice, turned me to stone, stone
Couldn't move 'cause the way she rockin' them Jimmy Choo's
I call her Madusa
She the type of girl that seduce ya (She is)
She that type of girl
She that type of girl that'll turn you into stone
Look her in the eyes and you can't leave her alone
She a Madusa
She the type of girl that seduce ya
She the, she the type of girl
She the type of girl that'll turn you into stone
Look her in the eyes and you can't leave her alone
Tell me how she always gets shoppin sprees outta me, yeah
I Louis Vuitton her and Dolce Gabbana...
Gucci or Prada, shawty get anything she wanna
Don't know how she always gets shoppin sprees outta me, yeah
It don't matter what it costed
Money ain't an object
She wear it the best, so she get it when she want it
