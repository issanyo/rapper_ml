[Verse 1]
Now every girl I've been with, been with after you
Baby it just ain't the same, no-no, no-no, no-no
Recently I had a girl and her name was Nikki
But she left me cause I called your name, no-no no-no
Girl, I been on that rebound tip
I can't believe that you got me feeling like this
And every other morning it's your face that I miss, man ya boy's sick
Cause shawty was a ten but I was on that bull when I was with you

[Chorus]
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
Girl when I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Girl with you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Girl when I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
And every other phone call it's one of, one of my dawgs
"Man I just seen Keisha and Nikki and them up in the mall"
"So what did she have on?"
"Gucci jeans, BeBe tee, Air Force Ones, hair all done"
Damn, man please don't tell me no more, man my heart is so sore
I wanna reclaim her, but you'll never get over what I put you through
And there's nothing that I wouldn't do, man my momma loved you
It's my fault I wasn't true but I was on that that shh when I was with you

[Chorus]
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
I was on that shh when I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Your boy was different cause I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Baby girl when I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you, when I was with you

[Bridge]
Girl I know it's way too late to even say "I'm sorry babe"
I wanna pick up up the phone, but inside my heart I know I'm wrong
And I still wanna be your man, but I thought it through time and time again
This road that I'm travelling on will leave me lost and alone

[Chorus]
When I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you
When I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you
When I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Oh, when I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you
