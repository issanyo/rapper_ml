Yeah, yeah

Bring Me Back to life4x

[beat cut]
This ain’t what I pictured, it wasn’t my vision
I know one things for certain, no I don’t feel like I’m living
We used to be vivid? Seem to fade into distance
Not tryna seek for somebody back
But it’s a long road and I’m just out here walking
And there’s no way I’m pushing through the darkness
