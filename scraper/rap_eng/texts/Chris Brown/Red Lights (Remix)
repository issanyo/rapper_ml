[Verse 1: Austin Mahone]
I know exactly what you like
And baby I'm about to take you down
You say you want me, is that right?
I think it's best we get up out here now
Because I saw you in that dress, they can't handle this
Speeding while I'm tryna steer
I'm kissing on your neck, I'm feeling on your leg
That yellow light ain't stopping now

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Girl, I ain't gotta waste a night with you babe
We doing 95 in a 35, baby, you know what to do

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
We gon' run some red lights
And you know there ain't no stopping even when we get home
Girl we gon' run some red lights
Push the pedal to the metal speedin' past the Five-O
And girl you know it's key push to start, sex in a car for hours
Your body parts under your hood, it's power, babe
And I ain't even tryna gas you up
And we gon' run some red lights

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Yeah backseat, ghostride the whip
Hold on it's gon' take long, endure this trip
Girl you got the new car, the new car smell
And we gon' give this new car a new car smell
Yeah revving my engine you turning me on
Yeah shifting your gears I love how you moan
Love how you moan, love how you moan
It was so good that I had to go back for a second
So I could just relive the moment

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain't gotta waste a night with you baby
We doing 95 in a 35, baby, you know what to do
Baby we gon'

[Chorus: Austin Mahone & Chris Brown]
We gon' run some red lights
And you know there ain't no stopping even when we get home
Girl we gon' run some red lights
Push the pedal to the metal speedin' past the Five-O
And girl you know it's key push to start, sex in a car for hours
Your body parts under your hood, it's power, babe
And I ain't even tryna gas you up
And we gon' run some red lights

[Bridge: Austin Mahone]
I know you're probably thinkin' that I'm crazy
But baby, we ain't slowin' down
I ain't ever been for actin' lazy
This the time to take it up, girl
My girl, I need more miles, girl
Take my hand and
Drive all through the night, I need you

[Chorus: Austin Mahone & Chris Brown]
We gon' run some red lights
And you know there ain't no stopping even when we get home
Girl we gon' run some red lights
Push the pedal to the metal speedin' past the Five-O
And girl you know it's key push to start, sex in a car for hours
Your body parts under your hood, it's power, babe
And I ain't even tryna gas you up
And we gon' run some red lights

[Outro: Austin Mahone & Chris Brown]
Red lights, all night baby
And we gon' take a midnight sex drive
Don't think you heard what I said, fuck every red light
Red lights, all night baby, midnight sex drive
