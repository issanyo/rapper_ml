[Intro]
Ay, can I talk to you for a minute?
You new around here?
Girl ain't no way, I won't let you down
If you let me I will show you how, I like what I see

[Chorus]
Ain't no way I'm gon' let you down
I know it's hard right now to say yes to me, but I'm gon' make you say you love me
The way, you look to me now, we need to get down
You don't know but I'm gon' make you say you love me girl

[Verse 1]
I ain't never fell for a girl like you, like you, with jeans and a body that curves like you, like you
I don't really care what they say, when it comes to a difference of age, I can show you all the things I'll do
Break your heart, never raise my voice, girl let down your guard
I know it's a lot to ask trust in me, but I can make a difference right now you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
Shorty tell me why you tryna keep all the goodies from me?
Can't you see what you holding me, that does to me, every time you walk past, oh?

[Chorus]
Ain't no way I'm gon' let you down
I know it's hard right now to say yes to me, but I'm gon' make you say you love me
The way, you look to me now, we need to get down
You don't know but I'm gon' make you say you love me girl

[Verse 2]
For a minute can you just think about us two? Swerving in my 645 SU
Me leaning over the seat, I'm passing you your own set of keys, showing you just how the teen got you
Trust and believe these words, from me been said before, trucking ain't my M-O
But girl you represent everything that Chris is about so shawty please

[Pre-Chorus]
Shorty tell me why you tryna keep all the goodies from me?
Can't you see what you holding me, that does to me, every time you walk past, oh?

[Chorus]
Ain't no way I'm gon' let you down
I know it's hard right now to say yes to me, but I'm gon' make you say you love me
The way, you look to me now, we need to get down
You don't know but I'm gon' make you say you love me girl

[Bridge]
For you girl, I'll buy you anything just to have you close to me
Cause you know ya loving is off the wall
Can't nothing come about, we'll take it slow
I ain't like the ones ya know, I'm gonna make ya love me all night long

[Chorus]
Ain't no way I'm gon' let you down
I know it's hard right now to say yes to me, but I'm gon' make you say you love me
The way, you look to me now, we need to get down
You don't know but I'm gon' make you say you love me girl
