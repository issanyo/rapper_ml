[Intro]
Got, got it on smash
Got, got it on smash

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
Pull up in that Bentley GT
Skrrt, skrrt, beep, beep
Girl, meet me in my bed
I'ma go down eat, eat
Ride them chi chis
Know I'ma skeet, skeet, oh yeah, baby
Got me on repeat, bitch wanna freak me
Girl, I know you ain't from 'round here
Shut up, shut up, make you cum easy
What up? What up? Pussy come easy
Pull up in that Bentley GT
Skrrt, skrrt, beep, beep
Girl, meet me in my bed
I'ma go down eat, eat
Ride them chi chis
Know I'ma skeet, skeet, oh yeah, baby
Got me on repeat, bitch wanna freak me
Girl, I know you ain't from 'round here
Shut up, shut up, make you cum easy
What up? What up? Pussy come easy


[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
She gon' make me go insane when I
Kiss ya lips, kiss ya
Spit on it
Girl I'ma let you feel that drip, feel that drip
Don't let me think or analyze
Swirl that tip, slow motion on the side
Take that dick
Don't give me lip, girl
When you're laying on your side
And when I lick them lips
Don't you think 'bout running from me
Put my dick, between your thighs

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
They don't, they don't know, Papi chulo
Runnin' up a check, you see it
They don't, they don't go
Dami Culo, 'cause you know my shit amazin'
They don't want no smoke, want no smoke
Bitches wanna have a nigga baby
She get down on all fours, hop on the pole
A hunnid more minutes
Baby I'm 'bout to give you rounds so wild
Bump and grindin', it's the perfect timing
I'ma turn you out, no lyin'
You gon' see

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
Pull up in that Bentley GT
Skrrt, skrrt, beep, beep
Girl, meet me in my bed
I'ma go down eat, eat
Ride them chi chis
Know I'ma skeet, skeet, oh yeah, baby
Got me on repeat, bitch wanna freak me
Girl, I know you ain't from 'round here
Shut up, shut up, make you cum easy
What up? What up? Pussy come easy
