[Intro]
Haha, y'all wanna learn y'all ABCs?
ABC, haha, yeah
Y'all gon' like this right here
Yeah, yeah
Oh, counting on ABC
Counting on ABC (ABC)

[Verse 1]
There are so many ways to spell it out, I love you
But only one way to show you, mmm (One way to show you)
I can scale the mountain and yell it out 'til my face turn blue
But when I come back down, what did that prove? (All that, what did it prove?)

[Pre-Chorus]
I would rather let my day to day
Actions speak louder than what I say
But if I had to pick letters from the alphabet
I would say it this way

[Chorus]
A, oh yeah, maybe we can B something you can C
DEFinitely, I know you want a G
Who can take you HI (HI), higher than a J
What I'm tryna say
Is love is as simple as ABC (Ooh, ooh)
All you gotta do is sing with me

[Verse 2]
Since I've made it clear, you understand I wanna be with you
All I wanna know is if it's cool (Know is that cool?)
Now it would hurt me so if you said, "I know" 'cause I been on my Ps and Qs
And I've Xed all the rest, this man's only got eyes for YOU, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I would rather let my day to day (Day to day)
Actions speak louder than what I say
If I had to pick letters from the alphabet
It would go this way

[Chorus]
A, maybe we can B, oh girl, something you can C
DEFinitely (Definitely), I know you want a G (Know you want a G, yeah)
Who can take you HI (HI), higher than a J
What I'm tryna say is
Is love is as simple as ABC (Ooh, ooh)
All you gotta do is sing with me

[Bridge]

Yeah, yeah
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Oh

[Chorus]
A, maybe we can B (We can be) something you can C
DEFinitely, I know you want a G (You want a G, oh girl)
Who can take you HI (HI), higher than a J (J)
What I'm tryna say
Is love is as simple as ABC (Ooh, ooh, love is)
All you gotta do is sing with me (Ha)
