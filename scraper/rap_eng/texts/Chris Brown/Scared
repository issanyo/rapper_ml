[Intro: Chris Brown]
Yeah, what's wrong?
Oh you scared now?
Alright
Section!

[Verse 1: Swift]
Baby, I'm endzy
Bando, telly
She just wanna do small talk
I just wanna give her the lengthy
Smoke like a rasta
What's that? Sesi
My bros are my brothers
I ain't never had besties
Brap mash in the man bag
Brap brap, headpiece
Jump out of a black van
Goons dem, scary
Peng girl wanna see the life
Don't think that they ready
Come alive in the night time
Most time I just stay dreamin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She wanna see what it's like to live the nightlife
Yeah, she thinkin' everything is alright
Baby, you don't wanna be left in the streets
If you're scared of your own heartbeat
Na, na, now you scared
Yeah yeah, why you scared?
Now I'm goddamn scared
Oh no, yeah, yeah
(Scared of your own heartbeat)

[Verse 2: HoodyBaby]
Shaq and Kobe, Kobe and Shaq, yeah the family back
HoodyBaby still rollin' like a handicap
The life I live, girl you know it's trap to trap
When life attacks soda, all type of crack
Falled off, type of cast, oh you likin' that
You play hard to get, oh you might be back
Two can play that game, hop inside the track
I been on my way, pull up, put 9 with that

[Verse 3: Littlez]
Wanna see what the life's like
What you know about hard times?
I done wrong
Need my money right
Say she wanna come overnight
Don't care what your friends say
Peng ting wanna come play
Get with a G and this too right
Came up on the trap line
2Pac, doin' thug life
Bad bitch, yeah that's my type
More life in the nightlife
Grew her up, I got the ice
Don't be scared, everythin' nice
Girl, just give me one night
You'll fall in love if I hit twice

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She wanna see what it's like to live the nightlife
Yeah, she thinkin' everything is alright
Baby, you don't wanna be left in the streets
If you're scared of your own heartbeat
Na, na, now you scared
Yeah yeah, why you scared?
Now I'm goddamn scared
Oh no, yeah, yeah
(Scared of your own heartbeat)

[Verse 4: Sleeks]
She just wanna live the nightlife
Smokin' weed and do WiFi
Let me tell you 'bout my life
Came up off of night crime
Skrr skrr, when I ride by
Hoodie on tight, creep in the night
Trap, get it in, get it all night
The mandem get a piece of the pie

[Verse 5: Inch]
Likkle thievin' girl wanna jump on my WiFi
Likkle idiot girl wanna talk about high life
Wild life, when I shell it like parklike
Ard life, they callin' me the dark knight

[Verse 6: Deepee & (Chris Brown)]
(The girl dem easy)
Down to ride, she gets down for thrills
Keep her close and she holdin' still
Hold the crop so I know it's real
I'm still tryna hide from the old bill
I'm so mad I ain't sign no deals
But my last Netflix got chills
So they still know the deal
Say she won't prefer trappin', she will
Still hittin' sales and it's morning now
So she can't stay the night still
I need a bando in the hills
Still, no family until
Rip a pack out the ceil'
Tell daddy, fuck how he feels

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She wanna see what it's like to live the nightlife
Yeah, she thinkin' everything is alright
Baby, you don't wanna be left in the streets
If you're scared of your own heartbeat
Na, na, now you scared
Yeah yeah, why you scared?
Now I'm goddamn scared
Oh no, yeah, yeah
(Scared of your own heartbeat)
