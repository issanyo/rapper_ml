[Chorus]
I'll wait for you 'til you come home
Here all alone, I'll stay alone for your love
For your love, for your love, for your love
For your love, for your love, for your love

[Verse 1]
Put my pimp cup down, nothing lost, nothing found
It's the things that you do, that makes me love you
Turn around and thump thump, that's what I want you to do
Even when I want you, I hope you want me too

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you 'til you come home
Here all alone, I'll stay alone for your love
For your love, for your love, for your love
For your love, for your love, for your love

[Verse 2]
I know what I'mma do now, I'mma keep you around
I like your teeth when you smile and your booty is like wow
So turn around and thump thump, all that junk in your trunk
I really, really want you, I hope you want me too

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you 'til you come home
Here all alone, I'll stay alone for your love
For your love, for your love, for your love
For your love, for your love, for your love
