[Intro: Trey Songz & Estelle]
Estelle, yeah, Breezy, Trigga

Oh yeah, this worldwide, but I mean it's been that way for a minute so
Who's on the beat? Who's that again?
David David Banner, let's go

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Estelle & Trey Songz]
Everybody know me up in here (up in here)
Around and round and round the world, yeah, it's serious (yeah)
They talking, I hear ringing in my ear (in my ear)
I'm getting dollars, getting pounds, it's something serious
And I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be anywhere (anywhere)
And you can't even see me, you ain't never there (you ain't never there)
'Cause I be international, catch me all around the world
Call me young, global and worldwide
Who's that?

[Verse 1: Estelle]
Give me what I want, coming up just where I want (ayy, a-ayy, ayy)
London with the uptown swing, yeah
And any time I've got, kill it when it's never dark (ayy)
Starting all the way to Beijing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause you know I'll go from here to Saint Tropez ('topez)
You see me, then you don't like every other day (day)
'Cause I'll be everywhere and you ain't never there (where, uh, uh, uh, uh)
No, you ain't never there (uh, uh, uh, uh)

[Pre-Chorus: Estelle]
If you don't see me better know that I'm getting my dough
Getting mine, listen
So don't watch me and my O's
Mind you P's and your Q's though

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Estelle & Trey Songz]
Everybody know me up in here (up in here)
Around and round and round the world, yeah, it's serious (yeah)
They talking, I hear ringing in my ear (in my ear)
I'm getting dollars, getting pounds, it's something serious
And I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be anywhere (anywhere)
And you can't even see me, you ain't never there (you ain't never there)
'Cause I be international, catch me all around the world
Call me young, global and worldwide
Yo, Trigga

[Verse 2: Trey Songz & Estelle]
My stock grown in Stockholm, dough her in Joeburg (yeah, uh)
Fuck the sound scan, I left with three million rands (I say)

Yeah, I take euro, plural, Estelle, your go

[Verse 3: Estelle & Chris Brown]
You're just like Jason, uh, uh, I'm everywhere (uh-huh, everywhere)
You're asking where I've been and you ain't even there (I been, uh, uh)
#whocares? I say I know you care (yeah, uh-huh)
My passport stamped here and there, yes, you care
Double booking shows and that, I turn 'em down, I turn 'em down (down)
Got to get this album out, so Kevin said to slow it down (down)
But I ain't slowing down, I only know speed (uh-huh)

[Bridge: Trey Songz & Estelle]
Take off, touch down, really that's my life (my life, ayy)

Somebody tell the pilot that the fliest has arrived (that's everywhere)
Tell him I'll probably be the fliest 'til I die
