[Intro]
Hey, you've reached Jessica
I'm not in right now but if you leave a message, I'll call you right back
Baby, I called you three times
I left text messages, emails
Yo, what I gotta do to get to you?
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I mean, it's like, what's so important you can't pick up the phone?
I mean, come on
I can't deal with this, call me back

[Verse 1]
Lately, more and more I been feeling some kind of way
And I ain't crazy, I know you got those texts from me (Got 'em from me, oh)
But it's this thing that we've been going through, is something wrong with you? (With you)
All it's doing is making me remember how we called it quits
Girl, I'm too young for this, when you

[Chorus]
When you turned away from me (Oh, woah)
Makes me think that I should just leave (Oh)
Go back to being the ol' G
Girl, I don't wanna lay here back to back
No, I don't want you mad at me
Snatching the covers, acting like you're asleep
When you know you're up, no
Girl, I don't wanna lay here back to back (Woah)

[Verse 2]
All night long, I find myself tryna get away and that ain't right, no
Looking through my phone tryna remember her name
That would only make it worse
We tried to talk through our problems, but it takes more than words
Said it don't even bother me but I swear it hurts
When I said I didn't wanna go through the same shit, this is what I meant, oh, woah

[Chorus]
When you turned away from me (Turned away from me, babe)
Makes me think that I should just leave (Maybe I should fall down)
Go back to being the ol' G (Oh)
Girl, I don't wanna lay here back to back (I don't wanna lay here, oh, back to back, baby)
No, I don't want you mad at me (We just fighting for the covers)
Snatching the covers, acting like you're asleep (Acting like we ain't really lovers)
When you know you're up, no (Oh, oh)
Girl, I don't wanna lay here back to back (No more, oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
I thought about it, got my bags, now I'm 'bout to roll
You standing there screaming, "Please don't go"
Too late, no excuses, I swear I can't do this
Don't wanna go through this no more
Now I know what it means to really have it bad
Got me laying in this bed and looking at your bags (Your bags, yeah)
Oh girl (Oh girl), wish you could make me believe
That you gon' change for me (Oh)

[Chorus]
When you turned away from me (Oh)
Makes me think that I should just leave (Just leave, oh)
Go back to being the ol' G (Makes me wanna go back to being the way that it used to be)
Girl, I don't wanna lay here back to back (Don't wanna lay here back to back, girl)
No, I don't want you mad at me
Snatching the covers (Oh), acting like you're asleep (Acting like you're asleep with me, yeah)
When you know you're up, no
Girl, I don't wanna lay here back to back

[Outro]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
