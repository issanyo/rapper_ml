[Verse 1]
Baby I just had a long day, I know you done seen my missed calls
I done called you a thousand times, I guess you out clubbing, baby
I'm not gon' trip, not gon' say shit, she gon' ask me why
She know I'm hiding all this pain inside, but she'll never see a nigga cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Back and forth with the games girl, you played me
This ain't what I wanted
She say she only wanna party
'Cause she in love with everybody

[Chorus]
I said baby look what you do to me
Girl, I've gone crazy
And you just got me waiting
I'm just waiting for you
I said baby look what you do to me
Girl, I've gone crazy
And you just got me waiting
I'm just waiting for you

[Verse 2]
I'm on a 101, Lamborghini speeding on the highway, that's suicide, I'm tryna find you, I'm scared
You with your girls, it's your night out
Stressing got me looking like a night owl
You a star now, all up on TV
I made you famous 'cause I put you in the streets

[Pre-Chorus]
Back and forth with the games girl, you played me
This ain't what I wanted
She say she only wanna party
'Cause she in love with everybody

[Chorus]
I said baby look what you do to me
Girl, I've gone crazy
And you just got me waiting
I'm just waiting for you
I said baby look what you do to me
Girl, I've gone crazy
And you just got me waiting
I'm just waiting for you

[Bridge]
I don't want you to leave, baby, sit down and listen
Let me love you, that's all I ever wanted to do, oh na na
And I made you cry a thousand times, when I went missing
Sorry, I hurt you, I just want you to know that, I love you

[Pre-Chorus]
Back and forth with the games girl, you played me
This ain't what I wanted
She say she only wanna party
'Cause she in love with everybody

[Chorus]
I said baby look what you do to me
Girl, I've gone crazy
And you just got me waiting
I'm just waiting for you
I said baby look what you do to me
Girl, I've gone crazy
And you just got me waiting
I'm just waiting for you
