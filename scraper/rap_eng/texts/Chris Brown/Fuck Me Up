[Intro]
Everything you did
Everything you did
Everything you did
Everything you did

[Verse 1]
Baby, you keep thinking of reasons, I don't know why
You don't love me, no, you can't even look in my eyes
How do I refuse? You don't even fuck me like you used to
Girl, I should've known from the mess you made, yeah

[Chorus]
Everything you did, you fuck me up, you fuck me up
Everything you did, you fuck me up, you fuck me up
Everything you did, you fuck me up, you fuck me up
Everything you did, you fuck me up, you fuck me up
Everything you did (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Got me runnin' round with the homies
Hit the strip club, throw a little money (yeah)
Never trust 'em 'cause they all so phony
Girl, these hoes are so phony (phony)
I fucked her and she want my homies
She fuck me and tell me I'm lucky
Girl, I just need somebody to love me like oh my God (woo, woo)
I can't fuck with you no more, and sometimes I think I'm better off alone
I can't fuck with you no more, 'cause there you were to tell me that I'm wrong
I can't fuck with you no more, 'cause girl, you know I never lose at all
I can't fuck with you no more, at all

[Chorus]
Everything you did, you fuck me up, you fuck me up
Everything you did, you fuck me up, you fuck me up
Everything you did, you fuck me up, you fuck me up
Everything you did, you fuck me up, you fuck me up
Everything you did

[Outro]
I can't fuck with you no more, no, dear, I can't fuck with you no more
I can't fuck with you no more, I can't fuck with you no more, oh, woah, woah
I can't fuck with you no more, I can't fuck with you no more, oh, oh
I can't fuck with you no more, I can't fuck with you no more
I can't fuck with you no more, oh, woah, yeah
