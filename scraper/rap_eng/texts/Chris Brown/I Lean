[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yeah, kinfolk, California kush, smell it through the vents though
Pimp flow, rolling through the 20s with my brim low
I been dope, I make your bitch bend over for some kins though
She wanna get nasty but just don't let her friends know
What's bracking P? What you need? I'm out of weed
Codeine, I got it, I'm spitting them 16s, a couple pills, tryna get to 100 mil
I'm moving mountains nigga, only seeing a couple hills
And you live in Hollywood, how that feel? Let's be real
Niggas thirsty, bitches dirty, I ain't worried
Niggas lying saying they 18 pushing 30, popping 30s, vision blurry, shipping 30s
A Golden State of mind with the assist to Curry
Gotta be ready to die when you playing that bloody Mary

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Whole 4 in the cup, I lean, yeah, I lean
4 grams in the blunt, I lean, I lean
6-4 in the cut, I lean, yeah, I lean
I lean, I lean

[Verse 2: Tracy T]
Keep a bad bitch leaning, got one in the Four Seasons
Got a bitch that fuck for money, got one fucking for no reason
Got a deuce and a 20 and I'm flipping with these goonies
With the goonies with the pistol and the 50, it's a trilogy
Go up for the trap, filling 'em with the green shit
Had to move the thrash bags, told the plug I can't quit
How your nigga looking broke, that's some shit you can't fix
I got 100 in the drum, man ain't shit, I can't hit
I just fuck her and forget about her, know I ain't shit
Got back to the chopper, had to get my chain licked
They came clean, I remake the boy for the same bitch
Oh you fuck, yeah I fuck to these, fuck the same bitch

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Whole 4 in the cup, I lean, yeah, I lean
4 grams in the blunt, I lean, I lean
64s in the cut, I lean, yeah, I lean
I lean, I lean

[Verse 3: HoodyBaby]
Big gold chain in a benz piece
Fat rocking, trapping out the Bentley
Young nigga selling highs for the low
Lil bitch, pussy back, she get fired at the door
I'm the one, black Neyo, fat Leo
Lions, tigers, bears, my set like Nat Geo
Swimming with the sharks, it's shocking I'm that ill
I'm swimming with the sharks, it's shocking I'm that ill
I trap still, selling coke, 'cus crack kills
I sip drank, I mix and match pills
I run plays all day, track and field
Go get your cat pill, tryna sell the crack still

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Whole 4 in the cup, I lean, yeah, I lean
4 grams in the blunt, I lean, I lean
64s in the cut, I lean, yeah, I lean
I lean, I lean
