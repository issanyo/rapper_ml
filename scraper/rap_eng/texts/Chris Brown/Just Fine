[Intro]
Hey, hey, oh girl, oh girl

[Verse 1]
We did everything we could do to try and make it work, we did, we did
Baby you look so confused cause it feels like there was no way we could lose, no way, no way
Baby I just don't know why I can't find the things you need in me, I can't, I can't girl
Baby they know just what to say, they tryna break us away from one another, but maybe they're right for a change

[Chorus]
I think, God will give you someone
Much better than me, trust me
Your eyes will be okay, it will be alright
You'll be just fine, just fine, just fine

[Verse 2]
I know that baby we would disagree constantly on the basic things, we did, we did
You thought that there was someone else all along, no way, no way
Baby I want to decide to stay right by your side, I can't, I can't girl
Baby they know just what to say, they wanna keep us away from one another, but maybe they're right for a change

[Chorus]
I think, God will give you someone
Much better than me, trust me
Your eyes will be okay, okay
Alright, alright, just fine, just fine

[Bridge]
I know baby, baby, baby can't you see that another fella just may be the kinda man that you need
You deserve it and I know that
I know another love has come your way, just listen to me when I say
You'll find him, you'll find him, be patient

[Chorus]
I think, God will give you someone
So much better than me, trust me
Your eyes will be okay
It will be alright, it will be just fine, just fine
Cause I know that baby, I think, God will give you someone, someone better
Better than me, trust me girl
No more pain, okay, no more pain, alright
It will be just fine, just fine

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
You wanna know why I'm sure, sure, sure
