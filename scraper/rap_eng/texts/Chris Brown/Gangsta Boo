[Intro]
Haha what's up ladies?
How y'all doing?
Yeah, I know what y'all need, all of y'all
And that's y'all gangsta boo right, come on
Mmm, yeah, yeah
Oh, no, no

[Verse 1]
It was 6 o'clock on the dot
That's when I seen this cutie, she was chilling at the spot
She was with her girls, I was with my boys
All of a sudden, I asked her to come over and say
"Whaddup, ma, how'd you like to get to know me?
I'm not shy, I'll do anything for you and
I'm that guy, say I pick you up at eight
I promise I won't be here late"

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all I ever wanted was someone I could hold on to
Someone who would never break my heart in two
Can I be the one for you?
Let's hang out and let's see

[Chorus]
Shawty want a rider (Gangsta boo)
I told her that I'd call her (It's true)
I'm not looking for no love but I think that you're the one
So come on, come on
Shawty want a baller (Gangata boo)
Someone who can spoil her (It's true)
I'm not looking for no love but I think that you're the one
So come on, come on

[Verse 2]
I never met no one like you before but I gotta take this chance
'Cause if I don't, I'll never know what this girl is really looking for
I may not have all the money, so who cares? I may not have all the fancy cars, I'll still be there
But what I have to give you, baby, is so much more

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all I ever wanted was someone I could hold on to
Someone who would never break my heart in two
Can I be the one for you?
Let's hang out and let's see

[Chorus]
Shawty want a rider (Gangsta boo)
I told her that I'd call her (It's true)
I'm not looking for no love but I think that you're the one
So come on, come on
Shawty want a baller (Gangata boo)
Someone who can spoil her (It's true)
I'm not looking for no love but I think that you're the one
So come on, come on

[Bridge]
Hey shawty, you're the one, nice lips, thick hips
Put me on, too tough, come on, girl, break me off
I can't see you wit nobody else
Nobody's like young Chris, no
Few cats, hat back, I'm the one
A few cats tried that, but they done, yeah, no
Come on, baby
Come on, baby, yeah

[Chorus]
Shawty want a rider (Gangsta boo)
I told her that I'd call her, yes I did (It's true)
I'm not looking for no love but I think that you're the one
So come on, come on
Shawty want a baller (Gangata boo)
Someone who can spoil her (It's true)
I'm not looking for no love but I think that you're the one
So come on, come on

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh oh
