[Intro: Tank]
Sho-sho-shots fired, fired, fired
Sho-sho-shots fired, fired, fired
Sho-sho-shots fired

[Verse 1: Tank]
Told her, "If you leave me you gon' need work
He gon' prolly do you worst," now look at your shots fired
Told her, "If she did it I'll bring the hearse
Need a Gucci, Louis purse," now look at your shots fired

[Pre-Chorus: Tank & (Chris Brown)]
My money long, my whip's grown, yeah, I'm talking big shit off of Patron
You think you the shit, girl, I put ya on, you think you the shit, girl, I put ya on (ah, ah)
Put ya on (bang bang), put ya on (bang bang), you think you the shit, girl, I put ya on
Put ya on (ah, ah), put ya on (bang bang), you think you the shit, shots fired (woo)

Bang bang she faded, bang bang she faded
Bang bang she faded (bang bang), shots fired

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Told her, "If she drop it, I'ma get it first
Make that ass go to work," now look at your shots fired
When I get it, I got your smell all on my shirt
I'ma make that pussy hurt, now look at your shots fired

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
My money long, my whip's grown, yeah, I'm talking big shit off of Patron
You think you the shit, girl, I put ya on, you think you the shit, girl, I put ya on (ah, ah)

[Bridge: Tank]
Told her, "If she leave it, ain't no coming back

Now I'm in the club with the baddest
Bottles coming from the sky, shots fired

[Pre-Chorus: Tank & (Chris Brown)]
My money long, my whip's grown, yeah, I'm talking big shit off of Patron
You think you the shit, girl I put ya on, you think you the shit, girl I put ya on (ah, ah)
Put ya on (bang bang), put ya on (bang bang), you think you the shit, girl, I put ya on
Put ya on (ah, ah), put ya on (bang bang), you think you the shit, shots fired (woo)

[Chorus: Tank & (Chris Brown)]
Bang bang she faded (bang), bang bang she faded (bang)
Bang bang she faded, shots fired (yeah, yeah)
Bang bang she faded, bang bang she faded
Bang bang she faded (bang bang), shots fired
