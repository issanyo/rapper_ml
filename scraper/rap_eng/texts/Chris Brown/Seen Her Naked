[Verse 1]
She's so pretty but her walks so mean
The hottest little number that I've ever seen
And if you seen a dime, she's that times three
She's a bad girl, just what I need, yeah
She's got a swagger, sharp like a dagger
Cupid done shot me, I gotta have her
I got a secret that she don't know
I already done seen her goods before, yeah

[Chorus]
I've been trying to get her off my mind
Fast forward but it rewinds cause I done seen her naked
To make it every time I turn around
I'm seeing her clothes come down cause I done seen her naked
No alcohol, no cigarettes, I can't forget
That I done seen her, I done seen her naked
I'm like a dog, I'm just a dog
And I done seen her, I done seen her, I done seen her, I done seen her
She took it off for me, she took it already
I done seen her, yeah yeah, I done seen her already
She took it off for me, she took it already
Now I done seen her, yeah yeah, I done seen her already

[Verse 2]
Ooh wee she got a body ha
And you can't, you can't do nothing 'bout it
You look her up and down, tryna figure out
How you gon' see what I saw
Don't even act like you surprised, she has 'em mesmerised
All the guys, she got 'em open
Now when you see her body everywhere
You gon' see, you gon' see what I'm talking about

[Chorus]
I've been trying to get her off my mind
Fast forward but it rewinds cause I done seen her naked
To make it every time I turn around
I'm seeing her clothes come down cause I done seen her naked
No alcohol, no cigarettes, I can't forget
That I done seen her, I done seen her naked
I'm like a dog, I'm just a dog
And I done seen her, I done seen her, I done seen her, I done seen her
She took it off for me, she took it already
I done seen her, yeah yeah, I done seen her already
She took it off for me, she took it already
Now I done seen her, yeah yeah, I done seen her already

[Bridge]
Okay, now all the ladies report to the dance floor
I wanna see you something you ain't never did before, it go a little something like this
Shake it to the East, shake it to the West, show 'em how to do it, your mama gon' be mad
But you gon' shake it, ay ay ay, you gon' shake it, you gon' shake it

[Chorus]
I've been trying to get her off my mind
Fast forward but it rewinds cause I done seen her naked
To make it every time I turn around
I'm seeing her clothes come down cause I done seen her naked
No alcohol, no cigarettes, I can't forget
That I done seen her, I done seen her naked
I'm like a dog, I'm just a dog
And I done seen her, I done seen her, I done seen her, I done seen her
She took it off for me, she took it already
I done seen her, yeah yeah, I done seen her already
She took it off for me, she took it already
Now I done seen her, yeah yeah, I done seen her already
