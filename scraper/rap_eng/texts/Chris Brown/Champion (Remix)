[Intro: Chris Brown & Chipmunk]
Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
Some people have to fight
(Remix, J. Cole, Breezy, yeah)
Some people give their lives, oh

[Verse 1: Chipmunk]
Team UK we on a mad ting (Hah!)
American girls they love my accent
Roadman, rate me, affiliated with money
Yardie girls love me, affiliated with Gully (Vado)
Hot topic, I'm the one they wanna talk on
A thin line between love and hate is what I walk on (Uh)
And any song I ever dropped was a right move (Yeah)
From the underground but came from the right too (Hah!)
You tryna blow your way over air (Over air)
I'm puttin' power moves for the year (Haha)
Type of idiot to hate before you hear
But even if you hatin', it's nothin', I got your ears

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Chipmunk & Both]
I'm always pushing myself to the limit, making sure I stay ahead (That's right)
You made me who I am, from the words you said (Yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Chipmunk]
Some people have to learn (Aha, yeah)
Some people wait their turn (Aha, uh)
Some people but not me, yeah, oh
I was born a champion (That's right)
Some people have to fight (Aha)
Some people give their lives (Aha)
Some people don't believe, woah, oh
But I was born a champion (Yeah)
But I was born a champion (Yeah, yeah)
But I was born a champion

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Uh, this gon' be the realest shit I ever wrote
Off the records, no cameras, forget a quote
Some of my family doin' good, most doin' dope
I'm from Virginia where they hang them niggas by a rope
I used to see my momma gettin' beat down
Is that the real definition of me now?
I fell off, back on my feet now
Headed to the sky, can't even see down
Award shows, I pour my heart out
And people still steady tryna point my flaws out
And I'd be lyin' if I say it ain't get to me
But I'm a champion, legend, history

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Chipmunk & Both]
I'm always pushing myself to the limit, making sure I stay ahead (That's right)
You made me who I am, from the words you said (Yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Chipmunk]
Some people have to learn (Aha, yeah)
Some people wait their turn (Aha, uh)
Some people but not me, yeah, oh
I was born a champion (That's right)
Some people have to fight (Aha)
Some people give their lives (Aha)
Some people don't believe, woah, oh
But I was born a champion (Yeah)
But I was born a champion (Yeah, yeah)
But I was born a champion

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Cole World, young Simba, story of my life
How to shine, put glory over ice
Rules made to be broken like a Oreo in life
Unabomber, they thought I blew up overnight (Boom)
UPS, plus it down, huh, while you BS'd and fucked around
I took a dollar to the city of the dreams
Called up my homies and then I put them on my team
And so we paid, and now we out in London, oh, behave
Cold World if you wonderin', snowy days
I made it through with no heaters, fuck the leaders
When we starvin' they won't feed us, we don't need 'em

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Chipmunk & Both]
I'm always pushing myself to the limit, making sure I stay ahead (That's right)
You made me who I am, from the words you said (Yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Chipmunk]
Some people have to learn (Aha, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Some people wait their turn (Aha)
Some people but not me, yeah, oh
I was born a champion (Champion, ooh, that's right)
Some people have to fight (Aha, woo!)
Some people give their lives (Aha)
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion (I was, I was, yeah)
Some people have to learn (Ahah)
Some people wait their turn (Aha)
Some people but not me, yeah, oh
I was born a champion
Some people have to fight (Aha)
Some people give their lives (Aha, give their lives)
Some people don't believe, woah, oh
But I was born a champion

[Outro: Chris Brown & Chipmunk]
Champion (Yeah)
But I was born a champion, woah, oh
Champion (Yeah)
But I was born a champion
