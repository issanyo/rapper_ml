[Intro: Diddy & Wiz Khalifa]
Ayo, Wiz
You already know
Yeah, I see you Polow

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter, Both & (Diddy)]
Don't you ever leave, don't you ever go away
I love you, I love you
Yeah, I'm begging you, don't you leave
(Now why you wanna go and leave me, baby?)
I'm begging you, don't you go, oh, woah
(Shit)
You've got my heart, you've got my heart, you've got my heart
(You know you got me though, yeah, check this out)
I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up
(I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up)
I know I fucked up, yeah
(I'm sorry, baby)
Baby, I need you, baby, I need you
(I need you, ayo, check this out)
Baby, I need you, yeah

[Verse 1: Diddy]
Yeah, but now you're gone and I'm forced to deal with your absence
All alone in this madness, all alone on my mattress
Don't know how the hell did this happen, you knew lovin' me was a hazard
Outcome of my actions, I wish we could go backwards, go back a couple of chapters
Back when there was laughter, back when we first met
Before we came such a disaster
Before your heart got shattered, before I forgot how much you mattered
Crazy we don't realize what we have until after we no longer have it
Uh-uh, uh, uh, uh-uh

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter, Both, (Diddy) & Wiz Khalifa]
Don't you ever leave, don't you ever go away
(Don't leave)
Don't you leave, don't you go
I love you, I love you
(I love you, I love you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm begging you, don't you leave
(You got me fucked up, girl)
I'm begging you, don't you go (Hahahaha)
(You know I can't live without you)
You've got my heart, you've got my heart, you've got my heart (Uh, uh)
(Yeah, get it, ayo, Wiz)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa & (Diddy)]
You say you're out the door (Yeah), you're out the door
You sick and tired can't take no more (Come on), can't take no more
You know the game and tried to play it time and time before
Told me you don't got time to waste, so hey, you got to go, you got to go (You got to go)
Can't help of think of you when I'm alone (Come on)
Tried and failed, I call your cell, you don't pick up your phone
Guess that really means you meant just what you said
Said just what you meant
Gettin' all this bread but it don't mean shit
Fuck the dough I get, plus the dough I spend, darling, just (Yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter, Both, (Diddy) & Wiz Khalifa]
Don't you ever leave, don't you ever go away, oh(Hahahaha)
(Don't leave, baby) (Yeah)
And throw it away, hear all them people talkin' 'bout us
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, yeah
Yeah, them hoes so in the way
But this is all I can say
(I love you)
I'm begging you, don't you leave (Hahahaha)
I'm begging you, baby (Uh)
I'm begging you, don't you go, don't you leave me
You've got my heart, you've got my heart, you've got my heart

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Hey superstar
There's a rain cloud above my heart
And it's only because of you
I knew it from the very start
But I'm not a complainer, no no
And that's the least of my problems today but (I'm out of here)
You can have my heart I'll give it away, babe
And I'ma honor and cherish our play time, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter & Both]
Don't you leave me now
Don't you ever leave, hey, hey, don't you ever go away, oh

You've got my heart, baby, you've got my heart
Oh, yes, you do
I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up
I know I fucked up, yeah, I fucked up
